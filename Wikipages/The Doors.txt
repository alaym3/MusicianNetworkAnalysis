'''The Doors''' were<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both American English and British English. Please do not change "were" to "was". --> an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in Los Angeles in 1965, with vocalist [[Jim Morrison]], keyboardist [[Ray Manzarek]], guitarist [[Robby Krieger]], and drummer [[John Densmore]]. They were among the most controversial and influential rock acts of the 1960s; mostly due to Morrison's lyrics and voice, along with his erratic stage persona, and the group was widely regarded as an important part of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|era's counterculture]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Weil |first=Martin |url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-05-20/entertainment/39395480_1_jim-morrison-the-doors-drummer-john-densmore |title=Ray Manzarek, Keyboardist and Founding Member of the Doors, Dies at 74 |date=May 20, 2013 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=December 14, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216143023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/ray-manzarek-keyboardist-and-founding-member-of-the-doors-dies-at-74/2013/05/20/8ebd6b56-c197-11e2-bfdb-3886a561c1ff_story.html |archive-date=December 16, 2013}}</ref>

The band took its name from the title of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', itself a reference to a quote by [[William Blake]].

== History ==
=== Origins (July 1965 – August 1966) ===
[[File:The Doors Logo.png|right|thumb|The Doors logo, designed by an [[Elektra Records]] assistant, first appeared on their 1967 debut album.]]
The Doors began with a chance meeting between acquaintances [[Jim Morrison]] and [[Ray Manzarek]] on Venice Beach in July 1965. They recognized one another from when they had both attended the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. Morrison told Manzarek he had been writing songs. As Morrison would later relate to Jerry Hopkins in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', "Those first five or six songs I wrote, I was just taking notes at a fantastic rock concert that was going on inside my head. And once I'd written the songs, I had to sing them."{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=75}} With Manzarek's encouragement, Morrison sang the opening words of "[[Moonlight Drive]]": "Let's swim to the moon, let's climb through the tide, penetrate the evening that the city sleeps to hide." Manzarek was inspired, thinking of all the music he could play to accompany these "cool and spooky" lyrics.<ref name=NPRRay>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Brent|title=NPR interview with Ray Manzarek|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/24/185827139/remembering-ray-manzarek-keyboardist-for-the-doors|publisher=NPR – Publicly accessed|access-date=June 5, 2013}}</ref>

Manzarek was currently in a band called [[Rick & the Ravens]] with his brothers Rick and Jim, while drummer [[John Densmore]] was playing with the Psychedelic Rangers and knew Manzarek from meditation classes.<ref name="pc43">{{Gilliland|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/search/?fq=str_title_serial%3A%22The+Pop+Chronicles+%28John+Gilliland+Collection%29%22&sort=date_a&start=42}}</ref> Densmore joined the group later in August, 1965. Together, they combined varied musical backgrounds, from [[jazz]], [[rock music|rock]], [[blues]], and [[folk music]] idioms.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=The Doors |title=The Grove Dictionary of American Music |edition=2nd |date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> The five, along with bass player Patty Sullivan,{{refn|group=nb|Patty Sullivan was later credited using her married name Patricia Hansen in the Doors' 1997 [[The Doors: Box Set#Disc 1: Without a Safety Net|''Box Set'' CD release]].<ref name="liner"/>}} and now christened the Doors, recorded a six-song demo on September 2, 1965, at World Pacific Studios in Los Angeles.{{refn|group=nb|This recordings were officially available much later in October 1997, on the Doors' ''Box Set'' CD release.

From February to May 1966, the group had a residency at the "rundown" and "sleazy" Los Angeles club [[London Fog (nightclub)|London Fog]], appearing on the bill with "Rhonda Lane Exotic Dancer".{{sfn|Weidman|2011|pp=120–121}} The experience gave Morrison confidence to perform in front of a live audience, and the band as a whole to develop and, in some cases, lengthen their songs and work "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]" and "[[Light My Fire]]" into the pieces that would appear on their debut album.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|pp=120–121}} Manzarek later said that at the London Fog the band "became this collective entity, this unit of oneness&nbsp;... that is where the magic began to happen."{{sfn|Weidman|2011|pp=120–121}} The group soon graduated to the more esteemed Whisky a Go Go, where they were the house band (starting from May 1966), supporting acts, including [[Van Morrison]]'s group [[Them (band)|Them]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/NiteCity/DarkSideOfLA001.html |last=Goldstein |first=Patrick |title=Nite City: The Dark Side of L.A. |date=September 1977 |magazine=[[Creem]] |access-date=March 18, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709054645/http://www.creemmagazine.com/_site/BeatGoesOn/NiteCity/DarkSideOfLA001.html |archive-date=July 9, 2008}}</ref> On their last night together the two bands joined up for "[[In the Midnight Hour]]" and a twenty-minute jam session of Them's "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.shadowplays.com/archive/whisky.php |title=Whisky a Go Go 1971 |website=Shadow Plays |access-date=December 24, 2009}}</ref>

On August 10, 1966, they were spotted by [[Elektra Records]] president [[Jac Holzman]], who was present at the recommendation of [[Love (band)|Love]] singer [[Arthur Lee (musician)|Arthur Lee]], whose group was with Elektra Records. After Holzman and producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]] saw two sets of the band playing at the Whisky a Go Go, they signed them to the Elektra Records label on August 18&nbsp;— the start of a long and successful partnership with Rothchild and sound engineer [[Bruce Botnick]]. The Doors were fired from the Whisky on August 21, 1966, when Morrison added an explicit retelling and profanity-laden version of the [[Greek myth]] of [[Oedipus]] during "The End".{{sfn|Cherry|2013|p=13}}

=== ''The Doors'' and ''Strange Days'' (August 1966 – December 1967) ===
[[File:Doors007 c.png|thumb|The Doors performing at [[Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival]] in 1967]]
The Doors recorded their [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]] between August and September 1966, at [[Sunset Sound Recorders|Sunset Sound Recording Studios]]. The record was officially released in the first week of January 1967. It included many popular songs from their repertory, among those, the nearly 12-minute musical drama "The End". In November 1966, [[Mark Abramson]] directed a promotional film for the lead single "[[Break On Through (To the Other Side)]]". The group also made several television appearances, such as on ''Shebang'', a Los Angeles television show, miming to a playback of "Break On Through".{{refn|group=nb| According to ''The Doors FAQ'' author Richie Weidman, this was either New Year's Day 1967,{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=251}} or March 6, 1967, as noted by Gillian G. Gaar.{{sfn|G. Gaar|2015|p=41}}}} In early 1967, the group appeared on ''[[The Clay Cole Show]]'' (which aired on Saturday evenings at 6&nbsp;pm on WPIX Channel 11 out of New York City) where they performed their single "Break On Through". Since the single acquired only minor success, the band turned to "Light My Fire"; it became the first single from Elektra Records to reach number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] singles chart, selling over one million copies.<ref name="Brodsky">{{cite magazine |last=Brodsky |first=Joel |title=Psychotic Reaction |magazine=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |date=February 2004}}</ref>

From March 7 to 11, 1967, the Doors performed at the [[The Matrix (club)|Matrix Club]] in San Francisco, California. The March 7 and 10 shows were recorded by a co-owner of the Matrix, Peter Abram. These recordings are notable as they are among the earliest live recordings of the band to circulate. On November 18, 2008, the Doors published a compilation of these recordings, ''[[Live at the Matrix 1967]]'', on the band's boutique Bright Midnight Archives label.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Simpson |first=Dave |date=December 19, 2008 |title=Film & Music: Rock & Pop: The CDs We Missed: The Doors: Live at the Matrix 1967: 4 Stars: (Rhino) |magazine=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Selvin |first=Joel |date=November 17, 2018 |title=City's Psychedelic Past Back In View In Doors' Matrix Discs |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}</ref>

The Doors appeared on American television on August 25, 1967, guest-starring on the variety TV series ''[[Malibu U]]'', performing "Light My Fire", though they did not appear live. The band is seen on a beach and is performing the song in playback. The music video did not gain any commercial success and the performance fell into relative obscurity.<ref>{{Cite video |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x51nbt_the-doors-light-my-fire-1967-malibu_music |title=The Doors – Light My Fire (1967) Malibu U TV |people=The Doors |work=[[Dailymotion.com]] |access-date=October 3, 2020}}</ref> It was not until they appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' that they gained attention on television.<ref name="Ed Sullivan">{{Cite web |url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-doors |title=The Doors Ed Sullivan |website=The Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=(SOFA Entertainment) |access-date=November 24, 2010}}</ref>

The Doors made their international television debut in May 1967, performing a version of "The End" for the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) at [[Sony Centre for the Performing Arts|O'Keefe Centre]] in Toronto.<ref name="Soundstage">{{Cite AV media |title=The Doors Soundstage Performances |title-link=Soundstage Performances |year=2002 |people=The Doors |publisher=[[Eagle Vision]] |place=Toronto, Copenhagen, New York |medium=DVD}}</ref> But after its initial broadcasts, the performance remained unreleased except in bootleg form until the release of ''The Doors Soundstage Performances'' DVD in 2002.<ref name="Soundstage" />

On September 17, 1967, the Doors gave a memorable performance of "Light My Fire" on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.<ref name="Ed Sullivan" /> According to Ray Manzarek, network executives asked that the word "higher" be removed. The group appeared to acquiesce, but performed the song in its original form, because either they had never intended to comply with the request or Jim Morrison was nervous and forgot to make the change (Manzarek has given conflicting accounts). Either way, "higher" was sung out on national television, and the show's host, [[Ed Sullivan]], canceled another six shows that had been planned. After the program's producer told the band they would never play on the show again, Jim Morrison reportedly replied: "Hey man. We just ''did'' the Sullivan Show."<ref name="Ed Sullivan" />{{sfn|Hogan|1994|p=30}}

On December 24, the Doors performed "Light My Fire" and "Moonlight Drive" live for ''[[The Jonathan Winters Show]]''. Their performance was taped for later broadcast. From December 26 to 28, the group played at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in San Francisco; during one set the band stopped performing to watch themselves on ''The Jonathan Winters Show'' on a television set wheeled onto the stage.{{sfn|Davis|2005|pp=219–220}}

The Doors spent several weeks in Sunset Studios in Los Angeles recording their second album, ''[[Strange Days (The Doors album)|Strange Days]]'', experimenting with the new technology, notably the [[Moog synthesizer]] they now had available.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=197}} The commercial success of ''Strange Days'' was middling, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' album chart but quickly dropping, along with a series of underperforming singles.<ref name="Brodsky" /> The chorus from the album's single "[[People Are Strange]]" inspired the name of the 2009 documentary of the Doors, ''[[When You're Strange]]''.<ref name="Documentary"/>

Although session musician [[Larry Knechtel]] had occasionally contributed bass on the band's debut album,{{sfn|Fong-Torres|2006|p=71}} ''Strange Days'' was the first Doors album recorded with a studio musician, playing bass on the majority of the record, and this continued on all subsequent studio albums.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=258}} Manzarek explained that his keyboard bass was well-suited for live situations but that it lacked the "articulation" needed for studio recording.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=258}} [[Douglass Lubahn]] played on ''Strange Days'' and the next two albums; but the band used several other musicians for this role, often using more than one bassist on the same album. Kerry Magness, [[Leroy Vinnegar]], [[Harvey Brooks (bassist)|Harvey Brooks]], Ray Neopolitan, [[Lonnie Mack]], [[Jerry Scheff]], Jack Conrad (who played a major role in the post Morrison years touring with the group in 1971 and 1972), Chris Ethridge, Charles Larkey and [[Leland Sklar]] are credited as bassists who worked with the band.<ref>This credits are included in [[AllMusic]] overviews of the group's six studio albums released during Morrison's lifetime; this sources are as follows:

=== New Haven incident (December 1967) ===
[[File:MorrisonJim.jpg|thumb|Morrison's mugshot taken in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]]]
On December 9, 1967, the Doors performed a now-infamous concert at [[New Haven Arena]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], which ended abruptly when Morrison was arrested by local police.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1967/12/11/archives/new-haven-police-close-the-doors-use-of-mace-reported.html?sq=Jim+Morrison+New+Haven&scp=2&st=p |title=New Haven Police Close 'The Doors'; Use of Mace Reported |date=December 10, 1967 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=November 21, 2010}}</ref> Morrison became the first rock artist to be arrested onstage during a concert performance.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=20}}{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=216}} Morrison had been kissing a female fan backstage in a bathroom shower stall prior to the start of the concert when a police officer happened upon them. Unaware that he was the lead singer of the band about to perform, the officer told Morrison and the fan to leave, to which Morrison said, "Eat it." The policeman took out a can of [[Mace (spray)|mace]] and warned Morrison, "Last chance", to which Morrison replied, "Last chance to eat it."{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=160}}{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=202}} There is some discrepancy as to what happened next: according to ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', the fan ran away and Morrison was maced; but Manzarek recounts in his book that both Morrison and the fan were sprayed.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=160}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=272}}<ref>{{Cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p13722|pure_url=yes}} |title=Jim Morrison – Biography |last=Huey |first=Steve |website=AllMusic |access-date=January 1, 2009}}</ref>

The Doors' main act was delayed for an hour while Jim Morrison recovered, after which the band took the stage very late. According to an authenticated fan account that Robby Krieger posted to his [[Facebook]] page, the police still did not consider the issue resolved, and wanted to charge him. Halfway through the first set, Morrison proceeded to create an improvised song (as depicted in the [[Oliver Stone]] [[The Doors (film)|movie]]) about his experience with the "little men in blue". It was an obscenity-laced account to the audience, describing what had happened backstage and taunting the police, who were surrounding the stage.<ref>{{cite web |first=Sterling |last=Whitaker |date=December 9, 2015 |title=Why Jim Morrison Got Arrested Onstage in New Haven |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jim-morrison-maced-and-arrested-in-new-haven/?utm_source=tsmclip |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=November 20, 2021}}</ref> The concert was surlily ended when Morrison was dragged offstage by the police. The audience, which was already restless from waiting so long for the band to perform, became unruly. Morrison was taken to a local police station, photographed and booked on charges of inciting a riot, indecency and public obscenity. Charges against Morrison, as well as those against three journalists also arrested in the incident ([[Mike Zwerin]], Yvonne Chabrier and [[Tim Page (photographer)|Tim Page]]), were dropped several weeks later for lack of evidence.{{sfn|Davis|2005|p=216}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=272}}

Recording of the group's third album in April 1968 was marred by tension as a result of Morrison's increasing dependence on alcohol and the rejection of the 17-minute "[[Celebration of the Lizard]]" by band producer Paul Rothchild, who considered the work not commercial enough.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Mick |last=Wall |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CGPaAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT197 |title=Love Becomes a Funeral Pyre: A Biography of The Doors |date=October 30, 2014 |publisher=Hachette UK |isbn=978-1409151258 |page=197}}</ref> Approaching the height of their popularity, the Doors played a series of outdoor shows that led to frenzied scenes between fans and police, particularly at [[Chicago Coliseum]] on May 10.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=268}}

The band began to branch out from their initial form for this third LP, and began writing new material. ''[[Waiting for the Sun]]'' became their first and only album to reach Number 1 on the US charts, and the single "[[Hello, I Love You]]" (one of the six songs performed by the band on their 1965 Aura Records demo) was their second US No. 1 single. Following the 1968 release of "Hello, I Love You", the publisher of [[the Kinks]]' 1964 hit "[[All Day and All of the Night]]" announced they were planning legal action against the Doors for copyright infringement; however, songwriter [[Ray Davies]] ultimately chose not to sue.{{sfn|Hinman|2004|pp=119–120}}{{refn|group=nb|However, in ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', Jerry Hopkins writes that the court in the United Kingdom determined in favor of Davies and any royalties for the song are paid to him.{{full citation needed|date=September 2021}}<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/11/the-kinks-ray-davies-brexit-is-bigger-than-the-berlin-wall |title=The Kinks' Ray Davies: Brexit is 'Bigger Than the Berlin Wall' |first=Adrian |last=Deevoy |magazine=The Guardian |date=May 11, 2017 |access-date=September 3, 2020}}</ref>}} Kinks guitarist [[Dave Davies]] was particularly irritated by the similarity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://kinks.it.rit.edu/misc/articles/latimes.html |title=Loyal Pains: The Davies Boys Are Still at It |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060907003915/http://kinks.it.rit.edu/misc/articles/latimes.html |archive-date=September 7, 2006 |access-date=December 23, 2006}}</ref> In concert, Morrison was occasionally dismissive of the song, leaving the vocals to Manzarek, as can be seen in the documentary ''[[The Doors Are Open]]''.<ref name="hellomanzarek">{{Cite AV media |title=The Doors are Open |date=1968 |last=The Doors |place=The Roadhouse, London |medium=Concert/Documentary}}</ref>

A month after a riotous concert at the [[Singer Bowl]] in New York City, the group flew to Great Britain for their first performance outside North America. They held a press conference at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA Gallery]] in London and played shows at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]]. The results of the trip were broadcast on Granada TV's ''[[The Doors Are Open]]'', later released on video. They played dates in Europe, along with [[Jefferson Airplane]], including a show in Amsterdam where Morrison collapsed on stage after a drug binge (including marijuana, hashish and unspecified pills).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/jim-morrison-passes-out-amsterdam/ |title=When Ray Manzarek Had to Fill in for a Passed-Out Jim Morrison |last=Gallucci |first=Michael |date=September 15, 2015 |website=[[Ultimate Classic Rock]] |access-date=October 3, 2020}}</ref>

The group flew back to the United States and played nine more dates before returning to work in November on their fourth LP. They ended the year with a successful new single, "[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]" (released in December 1968), which reached No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 1 in the [[Cashbox Top 100 number-one singles of 1969|''Cashbox'' Top 100]] in early 1969; this was the group's third and last American number-one single.<ref>{{cite web |title=Once Upon a Time in the Top Spot: The Doors, 'Touch Me' |date=February 12, 2019 |url=https://www.rhino.com/article/once-upon-a-time-in-the-top-spot-the-doors-touch-me |website=[[Rhino Records|Rhino.com]] |access-date=April 11, 2021}}</ref>

=== Miami incident (March 1969) ===
{{anchor|Miami incident}}
[[File:Jim Morrison mug shot.jpg|right|thumb|Jim Morrison on the day of his conviction in [[Miami]] for profanity and indecent exposure]]
On March 1, 1969, at the [[Coconut Grove Convention Center|Dinner Key Auditorium]] in the [[Coconut Grove]] neighborhood of Miami, the Doors gave the most controversial performance of their career, one that nearly "derailed the band".<ref name="allmusic.com" /> The auditorium was a converted seaplane hangar that had no air conditioning on that hot night, and the seats had been removed by the promoter to boost ticket sales.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=227}}{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=293}}

Morrison had been drinking all day and had missed connecting flights to Miami. By the time he arrived, drunk, the concert was over an hour late.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=227}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=312}} The restless crowd of 12,000, packed into a facility designed to hold 7,000, was subjected to undue silences in Morrison's singing, which strained the music from the beginning of the performance. Morrison had recently attended a play by an experimental theater group [[the Living Theatre]] and was inspired by their "antagonistic" style of performance art.{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=310}}{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|pp=292–293, 295}} Morrison taunted the crowd with messages of both love and hate, saying, "Love me. I can't take it no more without no good love. I want some lovin'. Ain't nobody gonna love my ass?" and alternately, "You're all a bunch of fuckin' idiots!" and screaming "What are you gonna do about it?" over and over again.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|pp=292–293, 295}}{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=230}}{{sfn|Manzarek|1998|p=312}}

As the band began their second song, "Touch Me", Morrison started shouting in protest, forcing the band to a halt. At one point, Morrison removed the hat of an onstage police officer and threw it into the crowd; the officer removed Morrison's hat and threw it.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=296}} Manager Bill Siddons recalled, "The gig was a bizarre, circus-like thing, there was this guy carrying a sheep and the wildest people that I'd ever seen."{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=297}} Equipment chief Vince Treanor said, "Somebody jumped up and poured champagne on Jim so he took his shirt off, he was soaking wet. 'Let's see a little skin, let's get naked,' he said, and the audience started taking their clothes off."{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=297}} Having removed his shirt, Morrison held it in front of his groin area and started to make hand movements behind it.<ref name="mojo">{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01278z4 |title=BBC Radio 2 – Mr Mojo Risin' |website=[[BBC]] |date=June 29, 2011}}</ref> Manzarek described the incident as a mass "religious hallucination".<ref name="mojo" />

On March 5, the Dade County Sheriff's office issued a warrant for Morrison's arrest, claiming Morrison had exposed his penis while on stage, shouted obscenities to the crowd, simulated [[oral sex]] on guitarist Robby Krieger, and was drunk at the time of his performance. Morrison turned down a plea bargain that required the Doors to perform a free Miami concert. He was convicted and sentenced to six months in jail with hard labor, and ordered to pay a $500 fine.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jim-morrison-is-charged-with-lewd-behavior-at-a-miami-concert |title=Mar 5, 1969: Jim Morrison is charged with lewd behavior at a Miami concert |website=History.com |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doors.com/miami/letter.html |title=2007 Letter to Governor Crist |publisher=Doors.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927100410/http://www.doors.com/miami/letter.html |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |access-date=August 20, 2011}}</ref> Morrison remained free, pending an appeal of his conviction, and died before the matter was legally resolved.

=== ''The Soft Parade'' (May–July 1969) ===
The Doors' fourth album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', released in July 1969, was their first-and-only to feature [[brass instrument|brass]] and [[string instrument|string]] arrangements. The concept was suggested by Rothchild to the band, after listening many examples by various groups who also explored the same radical departure.<ref name="Jackson" /> Densmore and Manzarek (who both were influenced by jazz music) agreed with the recommendation,{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=320}} but Morrison declined to incorporate orchestral accompaniment on his compositions.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|pp=338–340}} The lead single, "Touch Me", featured saxophonist [[Curtis Amy]].{{sfn|Ursula Dawn Goldsmith|2019|p=94}}
[[File:The Doors 1969.JPG|thumb|The Doors in late 1967]]

While the band was trying to maintain their previous momentum, efforts to expand their sound gave the album an [[experimental music|experimental]] feel, causing critics to attack their musical integrity.{{sfn|Matijas-Mecca|2020|p=80}} According to John Densmore in his biography ''Riders on the Storm'' individual writing credits were noted for the first time because of Morrison's reluctance to sing the lyrics of Robby Krieger's song "[[Tell All the People]]". Morrison's drinking made him difficult and unreliable, and the recording sessions dragged on for months. Studio costs piled up, and the Doors came close to disintegrating. Despite all this, the album was immensely successful, becoming the band's fourth hit album.{{sfn|Densmore|1990|p=187}}

=== ''Morrison Hotel'' and ''Absolutely Live'' (November 1969 – December 1970) ===
[[File:Doors - Morrison Hotel.jpg|left|thumb|Photo by [[Henry Diltz]] used on the cover of ''[[Morrison Hotel]]'']]
During the recording of their next album, ''Morrison Hotel'', in November 1969, Morrison again found himself in trouble with the law after harassing airline staff during a flight to Phoenix, Arizona to see [[the Rolling Stones]] in concert. Both Morrison and his friend and traveling companion [[Tom Baker (American actor)|Tom Baker]] were charged with "interfering with the flight of an intercontinental aircraft and public drunkenness".{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|page=347}} If convicted of the most serious charge, Morrison could have faced a ten-year federal prison sentence for the incident.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} The charges were dropped in April 1970 after an airline stewardess reversed her testimony to say she mistakenly identified Morrison as Baker.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=290}}

The Doors staged a return to their former direction with their 1970 LP ''[[Morrison Hotel]]'', their fifth album. Featuring a consistent [[blues rock]] sound, the album's opener was "[[Roadhouse Blues]]". The record reached No. 4 in the United States and revived their status among their core fanbase and the rock press. Dave Marsh, the editor of ''[[Creem]]'' magazine, said of the album: "the most horrifying rock and roll I have ever heard. When they're good, they're simply unbeatable. I know this is the best record I've listened to&nbsp; ... so far".{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} ''Rock Magazine'' called it "without any doubt their ballsiest (and best) album to date".{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} ''[[Circus (magazine)|Circus]]'' magazine praised it as "possibly the best album yet from the Doors" and "good hard, evil rock, and one of the best albums released this decade".{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=284}} The album also saw Jim Morrison returning as main songwriter, writing or co-writing all of the album's tracks. The 40th anniversary CD reissue of ''Morrison Hotel'' contains outtakes and alternative takes, including different versions of "The Spy" and "Roadhouse Blues" (with [[Lonnie Mack]] on bass guitar and [[the Lovin' Spoonful]]'s [[John Sebastian]] on harmonica).

July 1970 saw the release of the group's first live album, ''[[Absolutely Live (The Doors album)|Absolutely Live]]'', which peaked at No. 8 position.{{sfn|G. Gaar|2015|p=102}} The record was completed by producer Rothchild, who confirmed that the album's final mixing consisted of many bits and pieces from various and different band concerts. "There must be 2000 edits on that album," he told an interviewer years later.<ref name="Jackson" /> ''Absolutely Live'' also includes the first release of the lengthy piece "Celebration of the Lizard".

Although the Doors continued to face de facto bans in more conservative American markets and earned new bans at [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[Salt Palace (arena)|Salt Palace]] and Detroit's Cobo Hall following tumultuous concerts,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/the-doors-cobo-arena-1970/ |title=How the Doors Got Banned from Detroit's Cobo Arena |last=Lifton |first=Dave |date=May 9, 2015 |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/concertinfo/cancelled/700411.html |title=The Doors Cancelled Performances {{!}} Salt Lake City 1970 |website=Mildequator.com |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> the band managed to play 18 concerts in the United States, Mexico and Canada following the Miami incident in 1969,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mildequator.com/performancehistory/concertdates1969.html |title=The Doors Concert Dates & Info 1969 |website=Mildequator.com |access-date=January 15, 2020}}</ref> and 23 dates in the United States and Canada throughout the first half of 1970.

On December 8, 1970, his 27th birthday, Morrison recorded another poetry session. Part of this would end up on ''[[An American Prayer]]'' in 1978 with music, and is currently in the possession of the Courson family.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|page=375}} Shortly thereafter, a new tour to promote their upcoming album would comprise only three dates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rhino.com/aod/american-prayer-the-doors |title=The Doors: ''An American Prayer'' |website=Rhino.com |date=November 27, 2018 |access-date=February 11, 2021}}</ref> Two concerts were held in Dallas on December 11. During the Doors' last public performance with Morrison, at [[The Warehouse (New Orleans)|The Warehouse]] in New Orleans, on December 12, 1970, Morrison apparently had a breakdown on stage. Midway through the set he slammed the microphone numerous times into the stage floor until the platform beneath was destroyed, then sat down and refused to perform for the remainder of the show.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|pp=438–439}} After the show, drummer John Densmore met with Manzarek and Krieger; they decided to end their live act, citing their mutual agreement that Morrison was ready to retire from performing.{{sfn|Hopkins|Sugerman|1980|p=309}}

The Doors reunited in 2000 to perform on ''[[VH1's Storytellers]].'' For the live performance, the band was joined by [[Angelo Barbera]] and numerous guest vocalists, including [[Ian Astbury]] (of the Cult), [[Scott Weiland]], [[Scott Stapp]], [[Perry Farrell]], [[Pat Monahan]] and [[Travis Meeks]]. Following the recording the ''Storytellers: A Celebration,'' the band members joined to record music for the ''[[Stoned Immaculate: The Music of The Doors]]'' tribute album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stoned-immaculate-the-music-of-the-doors-mw0000103663|title=''Stoned Immaculate: The Music of the Doors'' |website=AllMusic |access-date=August 15, 2020}}</ref> On May 29, 2007, [[Perry Farrell]]'s group [[the Satellite Party]] released its first album ''[[Ultra Payloaded]]'' on [[Columbia Records]]. The album features "Woman in the Window", a new song with music and a pre-recorded vocal performance provided by [[Jim Morrison]].

"I like to say this is the first new Doors track of the 21st century", Ray Manzarek said of a new song he recorded with Robby Krieger, John Densmore and DJ/producer [[Skrillex]] (Sonny Moore). The recording session and song are part of a documentary film, ''Re:GENERATION'', that recruited five popular DJs/producers to work with artists from five separate genres and had them record new music. Manzarek and Skrillex had an immediate musical connection. "[[Sonny Moore|Sonny]] plays his beat, all he had to do was play the one thing. I listened to it and I said, ‘Holy shit, that's strong,’" Manzarek says. "Basically, it's a variation on ‘[[Milestones (composition)|Milestones]]’, by [[Miles Davis]], and if I do say so myself, sounds fucking great, hot as hell."<ref name="Skrillex">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/remaining-doors-members-record-with-skrillex-for-new-documentary-20111006?link=mostpopular1 |title=Remaining Doors Members Record with Skrillex for New Documentary |last=Baltin |first=Steve |date=October 6, 2011 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=October 13, 2011}}</ref> The track, called "[[Breakn' a Sweat]]", was included on Skrillex's EP ''[[Bangarang (album)|Bangarang]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bangarang-r2381342/review |title=''Bangarang'' – Review |website=AllMusic |access-date=March 16, 2021 |first1=Jon |last1=O'Brien}}</ref>

In 2013, the remaining members of the Doors recorded with rapper [[Tech N9ne]] for the song "Strange 2013", appearing on his album ''[[Something Else (Tech N9ne album)|Something Else]]'', which features new instrumentation by the band and samples of Jim Morrison's vocals from the song "[[Strange Days (Doors song)|Strange Days]]".<ref>{{Cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/tech-n9ne-aligns-with-the-doors-for-strange-2013-20130624 |title=Tech N9ne Works with the Doors |date=June 24, 2013 |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=July 9, 2017}}</ref> In their final collaboration before Manzarek's death, the three surviving Doors provided backing for poet [[Michael C.

== After the Doors ==
After Morrison died in 1971, Krieger and Densmore formed the [[Butts Band]] as a consequence of trying to find a new lead singer to replace Morrison.<ref>{{cite web |author=AllMusic staff

They formed the Butts Band in 1973 there, signing with Blue Thumb records. They released an album titled ''Butts Band'' the same year, then disbanded in 1975 after a second album with [[Phil Chen]] on bass.<ref>{{cite web |first=Greg |last=Prato |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/phil-chen-mn0000336805 |title=Phil Chen – Biography |website=AllMusic |accessdate=February 20, 2021}}</ref>

Manzarek made three solo albums from 1974 to 1983 and formed a band called [[Nite City]] in 1975, which released two albums in 1977–1978, while Krieger released six solo albums from 1977 to 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.goldminemag.com/articles/time-capsule-ray-manzarek-february-12-1979 |title=TIME CAPSULE: Ray Manzarek, February 12, 1979 |last=Goldmine1 |date=May 8, 2017 |website=Goldmine Magazine |language=en-US |access-date=May 10, 2019}}</ref>

In 2002, Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger formed together a new version of the Doors which they called [[the Doors of the 21st Century]]. After legal battles with drummer John Densmore over use of the Doors name, they changed their name several times and ultimately toured under the name "[[Manzarek–Krieger]]" or "Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of the Doors". The group toured extensively throughout their career.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rayandrobby.com/tour.html |title=Ray Manzarek and Robby Krieger of The Doors Tour Dates |date=April 23, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423213525/http://www.rayandrobby.com/tour.html |archive-date=April 23, 2011 |access-date=May 10, 2019}}</ref> In July 2007, Densmore said he would not reunite with the Doors unless [[Eddie Vedder]] of [[Pearl Jam]] was the lead singer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Densmore Considers Full Doors Reunion - With Vedder|url=https://www.contactmusic.com/the-doors/news/densmore-considers-full-doors-reunion---with-vedder_1021472|website=[[Contactmusic.com]]|date=February 8, 2007|access-date=February 20, 2021}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
Beginning in the late 1970s, there was a sustained revival of interest in the Doors which created a new generation of fans.{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=418}} The origin of the revival is traced to the release of the album ''An American Prayer'' in late 1978 which contained a live version of "[[Roadhouse Blues]]" that received considerable airplay on [[album-oriented rock]] radio stations. In 1979 the song "[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]" was featured in dramatic fashion in the film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'',<ref name="allmusic.com" />{{sfn|Weidman|2011|p=421}} and the next year the best-selling biography of Morrison, ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', was published. The Doors' first album, ''The Doors'', re-entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart in September 1980 and Elektra Records reported the Doors' albums were selling better than in any year since their original release.<ref name="Breslin" /> In September 1981, ''Rolling Stone'' ran a cover story on Morrison and the band, with the title "Jim Morrison: He's Hot, He's Sexy and He's Dead."<ref name="Breslin">{{Cite magazine |last=Breslin |first=Rosemary |date=September 19, 1981 |title=Jim Morrison: He's Hot, He's Sexy and He's Dead |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/jim-morrison-hes-hot-hes-sexy-and-hes-dead-113162/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |location=New York City |access-date=January 27, 2020}}</ref> In response a new compilation album, ''[[Greatest Hits (The Doors album)|Greatest Hits]]'', was released in October 1980. The album peaked at No. 17 in ''Billboard'' and remained on the chart for nearly two years.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |url=https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbu/page/247 |title=Top Pop Albums 1955–2001 |date=2001 |publisher=Record Research Inc. |isbn=0-89820-147-0 |location=Menomonee Falls |page=[https://archive.org/details/joelwhitburnstop00whitbu/page/247 247] |author-link=Joel Whitburn}}</ref>
[[File:Los Angeles (California, USA), Hollywood Boulevard, The Doors -- 2012 -- 5040.jpg|thumb|A star for The Doors on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Los Angeles, California]]

The revival continued in 1983 with the release of ''[[Alive, She Cried]]'', an album of previously unreleased live recordings. The track "[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]" reached No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Top Tracks]] chart<ref>{{Cite book |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |title=Rock Tracks |date=2002 |publisher=Record Research Inc. |isbn=0-89820-153-5 |location=Menomonee Falls |page=49}}</ref> and the video was in [[Rotation (music)|heavy rotation]] on [[MTV]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=January 7, 1984 |title=Video Music Programming |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |location=New York}}</ref> Another compilation album, ''[[The Best of the Doors (1985 album)|The Best of the Doors]]'' was released in 1987 and went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] in 2007 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] for sales of 10 million certified units.

A second revival, attracting another generation of fans, occurred in 1991 following the release of the film ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', directed by [[Oliver Stone]] and starring [[Val Kilmer]] as Morrison. Stone created the script from over a hundred interviews of people who were in Jim Morrison's life. He designed the movie by picking the songs and then adding the appropriate scripts to them.{{sfn|Riordan|Prochnicky|1991|p=311}} The original band members did not like the film's portrayal of the events. In the book ''The Doors'', Manzarek states, "That Oliver Stone thing did real damage to the guy I knew: Jim Morrison, the poet." In addition, Manzarek claims that he wanted the movie to be about all four members of the band, not only Morrison.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Broeske |first=P |date=March 10, 1991 |title=Stormy Rider |newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]]}}</ref> Densmore said, "A third of it's fiction." In the same volume, Krieger agrees with the other two, but also says, "It could have been a lot worse." The film's [[The Doors (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] reached No. 8 on the ''Billboard'' album chart and ''Greatest Hits'' and ''The Best of the Doors'' re-entered the chart, with the latter reaching a new peak position of No. 32.
