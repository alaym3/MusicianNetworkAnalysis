In 2018, the streaming platform [[Spotify]] named "emo rap" its fastest growing genre. Higgins achieved arguably the most mainstream success of any artist in the sub-genre. This was boosted by his collaboration with [[Panic! at the Disco]] frontman [[Brendon Urie]].<ref name="Rindner">{{cite web|author=Rindner, Grant|date=December 11, 2018|title=Juice WRLD is Setting Himself Apart by Embracing Rap's Trends and Traditions|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/12/juice-wrld-freestyle-interview|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209070618/https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2018/12/juice-wrld-freestyle-interview|archive-date=December 9, 2019|access-date=December 9, 2019|work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]}}</ref> Higgins himself considered the [[emo]] label to be both negative and positive as he felt music sometimes has to be a bit dark to reflect his belief that the world is not really a light or a happy place.<ref name="Maduakolam" />

Higgins said that "Lucid Dreams" was the only track from ''[[Goodbye & Good Riddance]]'' that he wrote, while the rest was done [[impromptu]]. Rather than write down his rhymes, Higgins crafted whole songs in a few minutes by way of off-the-cuff rhyming.<ref name="Rindner" /> Most of the time, his songwriting process involved freestyling lyrics instead of writing them down. When he did write a song, it usually began with hearing a beat and instantaneously conceiving an idea, although Higgins sometimes found himself alone with an idea for a song and afraid that he would be unable to remember it hours later after arriving at the studio. For this reason, he sometimes took a voice memo or simply wrote the whole song.<ref name="Maduakolam">{{cite web|author=Maduakolam, Emmanuel|date=July 31, 2018|title=Juice WRLD Talks 'Lucid Dreams' and Emo Rap|url=https://hypebeast.com/2018/7/juice-wrld-interview-goodbye-and-good-riddance|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191109030026/https://hypebeast.com/2018/7/juice-wrld-interview-goodbye-and-good-riddance|archive-date=November 9, 2019|access-date=August 20, 2018|work=Hypebeast|publisher=Hypebeast Limited}}</ref>

Higgins saw the value in his position as one of very few contemporary SoundCloud artists who could compose soul-bearing [[ballad]]s and [[ode]]s but remain comfortable [[freestyle rap]]ping over classic hip hop beats.<ref name="Rindner" /> Rather than eschewing it, his freestyles emphasize [[wordplay]] and feel indebted to the art form's tradition.<ref name="Rindner" /> When asked for his opinion on why freestyles are no longer considered the [[rite of passage]] in [[hip hop culture]] as they once were he replied, "Stuff is just changing, that's all. We're moving into a new era of music. I feel like it's not necessarily a good thing to forget where shit started, but shit is changing".<ref name="Rindner" /> Though his songs do not always feature very technical lyricism, intricate [[Flow (music)|flows]] or tongue-twisting wordplay, Higgins delivered inventive flows and memorable bars during his freestyles.<ref name="Rindner" />

=== Lyrical themes ===
His most successful singles express melodic, emo-inspired compositions that exhibit his songwriting skill.<ref name="Rindner" /> His songs harbor melodic flows to complement their melancholic subjects.<ref name="Rindner" /> Higgins claimed he talked about things others are thinking but are afraid to speak about, such as being vulnerable and hurt.<ref name="Maduakolam" /> Having built a following through emo rap, Higgins offered lyrics that touch on heartbreak and fragmented feelings.<ref name="Maduakolam" /> Though not entirely groundbreaking, his musical approach provided a sense of familiarity that heartbroken adolescents of the current generation could gravitate towards.<ref name="Maduakolam" /> Higgins maintained that he only wrote from personal experience, and found strength in his pain and vulnerability.<ref name="Maduakolam" /> While the lyrical content of his songs often centered on heartache and bitterness, there are occasionally more boastful lines and creative references.<ref name="Rindner" />
