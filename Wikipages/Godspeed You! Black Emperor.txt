The group releases recordings through [[Constellation Records (Canada)|Constellation]], an [[independent record label]] also located in Montreal. After the release of their [[F♯ A♯ ∞|debut album]] in 1997, the group toured regularly from 1998 to 2003. Their second album, 2000's ''[[Lift Your Skinny Fists Like Antennas to Heaven]]'', received critical acclaim and has been named as one of the best albums of the decade.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Greer |first1=Nick |title=Top 100 Albums of the Decade |url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/blog/2010/06/11/top-100-albums-of-the-decade-10-1/ |website=Sputnikmusic |access-date=28 July 2019 |date=11 June 2010}}</ref> In 2003, the band announced an indefinite hiatus in order for members to pursue other musical interests.

Since reforming, they have released four more albums, the most recent being ''[[G_d's Pee at State's End!]]'' in April 2021.

The band has gained a dedicated [[cult following]] and remains very influential in the [[post-rock]] genre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thekey.xpn.org/2013/09/16/just-announced-post-rock-cult-faves-godspeed-you-black-emperor-headlining-union-transfer/ |title=Just Announced: Post-rock cult faves Godspeed You!

==History==
Godspeed You! Black Emperor was formed in 1994 in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], by [[Efrim Menuck]] ([[Electric guitar|guitar]]), [[Mike Moya]] (guitar), and [[Mauro Pezzente]] ([[Bass guitar|bass]]).<ref name="Wire">{{cite web|url=http://www.brainwashed.com/godspeed/wire.html|title=Interview in The Wire|year=1998|author=David Keenan}}</ref><ref name="Larkin2011">Colin Larkin. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=PA1439 The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]''. Omnibus Press; 27 May 2011. {{ISBN|978-0-85712-595-8}}. p. 1439.</ref> The band took its name from ''[[God Speed You! Black Emperor]]'', a 1976 Japanese [[black-and-white]] [[Documentary film|documentary]] by director [[Mitsuo Yanagimachi]], which follows the exploits of a [[Bōsōzoku|Japanese biker gang]], the Black Emperors.<ref name="Wire"/> The band initially assembled after being offered a supporting act for another local band named Steak 72.<ref name="wire2">{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/wire2.html|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! interview with ''The Wire''|access-date=February 24, 2009|year=2000|author=Keenan, David|work=brainwashed.com}}</ref> Thereafter, the trio performed live on a few separate occasions.

The band quickly expanded and continued to perform live. According to Menuck, joining the group was quite simple: "It was like if anyone knew anybody who played an instrument and seemed like an okay person, they would sort of join up."<ref name="brainwashed1">{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/deadmetheney/interviews/amazeine.htm|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor interview with ''aMAZEzine!''|access-date=February 14, 2009|year=1998|author=St-Jacques, Marie-Douche|work=aMAZEzine}}</ref> In short order, the group's numbers ebbed and flowed. Local musicians would often join the band for a handful of performances, then depart. The revolving door nature of the group's membership frequently caused it strain before the release of ''[[F♯ A♯ ∞]]''.<ref name="brainwashed1"/>  After that release, the group stabilized around a nine-person lineup with Menuck, Moya and [[David Bryant (musician)|David Bryant]] on guitars, Pezzente and Thierry Amar on bass guitars, Aidan Girt and Bruce Cawdron on drums, and Sophie Trudeau and Norsola Johnson on violin and cello respectively.  Moya would depart in 1998 to focus on [[HṚṢṬA]], being replaced by Roger Tellier-Craig of [[Fly Pan Am]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Godspeed You !

Although various members of the band are often pinned down as [[anarchism|anarchists]], no one in the band explicitly subscribed to this label;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressnightout.com/2008/05/allusions_of_grandeur_thee_silver_mt_zio/ |title=Allusions of Grandeur: Thee Silver Mt. Zion |publisher=Expressnightout.com |access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> however, as of 2014, Menuck was calling himself an anarchist.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rubsam|first=Rob|url=http://therumpus.net/2014/04/the-rumpus-interview-with-efrim-menuck/|title=The Rumpus Interview with Efrim Menuck|publisher=The Rumpus|access-date=May 25, 2014|date=April 2014}}</ref> In any case, there is a strong political component to the band's music.<ref>{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Mark|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17283-allelujah-dont-bend-ascend/|title="Allelujah! Don't Bend! Ascend!" Review|publisher=Pitchfork.com|access-date=May 6, 2014}}</ref> Much of the band's music exudes [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] themes. For example, the [[liner notes]] to ''Yanqui U.X.O.'' describe the song "09-15-00" as "[[Ariel Sharon]] surrounded by 1,000 [[Israel Defense Forces|Israeli soldiers]] marching on [[al-Aqsa Mosque|al-Haram Ash-Sharif]] & provoking another [[Second Intifada|Intifada]],"<ref>{{cite web|title=Godspeed You!

Black Emperor's Yanqui U.X.O., Bought Out By Terra Firma for $4.7 Billion; Sorry Warner Music Group |url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/news/emi-defies-fate-predicted-godspeed-you-black-emperors-yanqui-uxo-bought-out-te|website=Tiny Mix Tapes|date=May 25, 2007|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> Several of its songs also incorporate voice samples which express political sentiments, most notably "The Dead Flag Blues" (on ''F♯A♯∞'') and "BBF3" (on ''Slow Riot for New Zerø Kanada'').

Members of the group have formed a number of [[side project]]s, including [[Thee Silver Mt. Zion Memorial Orchestra & Tra-La-La Band]], [[Fly Pan Am]], [[HṚṢṬA]], [[Esmerine]], and [[Set Fire to Flames]].

The band released the CD versions of its first two albums and EP on the [[Kranky (record label)|Kranky]] record label, and released the [[Gramophone record|LP]]s through Constellation Records. All editions of their subsequent studio material have been released through Constellation.

In 2004, long-time guitarist Roger Tellier-Craig left the band on amicable terms to devote more time to [[Fly Pan Am]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Godspeed You!

The group was once misconstrued as being a band of terrorists.<ref name="cstimages">{{cite web|url=http://cstrecords.com/cst_images/gybeimages_web.jpg |title=Godspeed You!

She quickly passed a note to another customer asking them to call the police. When the local police appeared, the group was held until it could be questioned by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]]. Although the police were suspicious of the band's anti-government documents and some photos it had (such as those of oil rigs), they found no incriminating evidence.  After [[background check]]s were run, the ensemble was released from custody and continued on its way to its next show in [[St. Louis, MO|Saint Louis]]. [[Efrim Menuck]] later spoke to the crowd during their appearance in Missouri about what happened to them and speculated that their origin was a motive for being released quickly ("It's a good thing we're nice white kids from Canada").<ref name="2003-03-16">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gybe2003-03-16.shn|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! at Mississippi Nights (2003-03-16)|access-date=December 24, 2006|publisher=Internet Archive|year=2003|author=Godspeed You Black Emperor!|work=Live Music Archive|format=shn}}</ref> The incident was mentioned in [[Michael Moore]]'s book ''[[Dude, Where's My Country?]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Five Noteworthy Facts You May Not Know About Godspeed You!

In 2010, the band reported it was reuniting for an [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music event in the UK as well as further US dates. Mike Moya re-joined the band for the reunion, while original cellist Norsola Johnson declined to participate. The band played a full North American and European tour in 2011, and more dates in the UK including an appearance at the ATP '[[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|I'll Be Your Mirror]]' music festival in London.

The following year the band appeared at the Pitchfork Music Festival in Chicago and the 2012 All Tomorrow's Parties I'll Be Your Mirror festival in New York.<ref name="atpibym2012">{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/ibymusa2012.php |title=I'll Be Your Mirror USA 2012 curated by Greg Dulli & ATP – All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> Drummer Timothy Herzog began touring with the band after the departure of Bruce Cawdron.

In 2013, the band won the [[Polaris Music Prize]], but it criticized the cost of the ceremony during the time of austerity, stating, "Maybe the next celebration should happen in a cruddier hall, without the corporate banners and culture overlords."<ref name="Polaris">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24231672 |title=Godspeed You!

On March 31, 2015, Godspeed You! Black Emperor released its fifth album, ''[[Asunder, Sweet and Other Distress]]''. On September 22, 2017, the group released its sixth album, ''[[Luciferian Towers]]''.

In early March 2021, the band announced its seventh album, ''[[G_d's Pee at State's End!]]'' through Constellation Records<ref>{{Cite web|title=Godspeed You!

==Live concerts==
Film loop projections are an important aspect of the group's live show, explained by [[Efrim Menuck]] as "[putting] the whole into context".<ref name="oorinterview">{{cite web|url=http://brainwashed.com/godspeed/oor.html|title=Interview with Godspeed You Black Emperor!|access-date=December 24, 2006|publisher=OOR|year=2001|author=Visser, Menno|work=OOR Magazine}}</ref>

Because the band is [[Bootleg recording|taper]]-friendly, that is, it allows audience members to record its live performances, fans often release new material before the band makes an official recording.<ref name="archive1">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/gybe2003-05-14.shnf|title=Godspeed You Black Emperor! at L'Olympic (2003-05-14)|access-date=December 17, 2006|publisher=Internet Archive|year=2003|author=Godspeed You Black Emperor!|work=Live Music Archive|format=shnf}}</ref>

The band toured Australia/New Zealand for the first time in February 2013, including a performance at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] 'I'll Be Your Mirror' festival in Melbourne on February 16.

The band toured China for the first time in April 2013, giving performances in Shanghai and Beijing,<ref>{{cite web|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor China Tour|url=http://www.spli-t.com/gybe/en/|website=Spli-t|date=April 1, 2013|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> and revisited China in March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|title=Godspeed You!

The band supported [[Nine Inch Nails]] on its [[Twenty Thirteen Tour|Tension tour]] in October 2013, starting at the [[TD Garden]] in [[Boston]] on October 11.<ref name="nintour">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/51053-nine-inch-nails-announce-massive-tour-with-godspeed-you-black-emperor/|title=Nine Inch Nails Announce Massive Tour With Godspeed You! Black Emperor|access-date=June 6, 2013|publisher=Pitchfork|year=2013|author=Minsker, Evan|work=Pitchfork}}</ref>

After a break for much of 2014 the band embarked on a busy schedule of concert and festival dates across North America, Europe and around the world during 2015 and 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlists/godspeed-you-black-emperor-63d69a73.html|title=Godspeed You! Black Emperor Concert Setlists|website=setlist.fm|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> Two new songs were previewed in many of the shows picking up the fan titles "Buildings" and "Railroads" from the projections that accompanied them. The band also lent live performances of some of their older and current tracks to a revival of the 2005 work "monumental", by Canadian dance troupe, [[Holy Body Tattoo]] during 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bam.org/dance/2016/monumental|title=monumental|website=BAM.org|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref>
