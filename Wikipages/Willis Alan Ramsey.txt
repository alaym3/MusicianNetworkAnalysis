'''Willis Alan Ramsey''' (born 5 March 1951) is an American [[singing|singer]]/[[songwriter]], a cult legend among fans of [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and Texas country. He was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], and raised in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]]. Ramsey graduated from [[Highland Park High School (University Park, Texas)|Highland Park High School]] in 1969, and was a prominent baritone in the school's Lads and Lassies Choir. In his senior year, he played a leading role in the musical ''[[Carousel (musical)|Carousel]]''. He released the critically acclaimed album, ''[[Willis Alan Ramsey (album)|Willis Alan Ramsey]]'', in 1972 on the [[Shelter Records|Shelter]] label. The album included "[[Muskrat Candlelight]]" which was covered (under the title "Muskrat Love") by [[America (band)|America]] in 1973  and by [[Captain & Tennille]] in 1976.<ref>{{cite web | url=

Owing to conflict with his label, Ramsey left Shelter at the end of his contract. As a result, Ramsey's fans have been waiting more than 40 years for the release of his "mythical second album". When asked where the new album is, he often responds, "What's wrong with the first one?"

In the 1980s, he moved to [[Great Britain]]<ref>[http://www.willisalanramsey.com/content/bio.htm Biography]</ref> to reconnect with his ancestry and study traditional and modern music narrative. At the same time, he enjoyed a revival in the [[United States]], due in part to numerous artists who cut versions of Ramsey's songs, including [[Widespread Panic]] ("Geraldine & The Honey Bee"), [[Jerry Jeff Walker]] ("Northeast Texas Women"), [[Waylon Jennings]], [[Shawn Colvin]] ("Satin Sheets"), [[Jimmy Buffett]] ("The Ballad of Spider John"), and [[Jimmie Dale Gilmore]] ("Goodbye to Old Missoula").<ref name="DallasNews">{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-ramsey_0916gd.State.Edition1.1f6cc5f.html|title=Seminal songwriter Willis Alan Ramsey prepares his second album â€“ 37 years later |last=Peppard|first=Alan|date=16 September 2009|work=Dallas Morning News|accessdate=18 February 2010}}</ref> In 1989, he returned to the United States and began performing again. Backed by [[Champ Hood]], multi-instrumentalist (of [[Uncle Walt's Band]] fame), Ramsey could often be found on the same bill with another Dallas singer-songwriter, Alison Rogers. The two married in 1991 and continue to perform together. In 1996, Ramsey and Rogers co-wrote [[Lyle Lovett]]'s hit, "[[That's Right (You're Not from Texas)]]".

In 2000, Ramsey appeared on ''[[Austin City Limits]]'', showcasing his new material and performing his classics. He is currently mixing his new album, ''Gentilly'', so called since 1997.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2018/04/09/598843883/the-follow-up |title=The Follow-Up|last=Patoski|first=Joe Nick|publisher=[[NPR]]|quote=The whole album, still titled ''Gentilly'' as far as anyone knows, will follow later this spring.
