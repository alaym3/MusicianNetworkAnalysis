==Biography==
===Early life===
Edin Osmić was born to [[Bosniaks|Bosniak]] parents Azemina and Fehim, and raised in [[Brčko (city)|Brčko]] (at the time [[SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[SFR Yugoslavia]]) where he finished  elementary school. In 1992, when the [[Bosnian War]] started, he left [[Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and went to [[Zagreb]], the capital of [[Croatia]], where he began attending high [[mechanical engineering]] school.<ref name="sevdah_o_rodama">Documentary film "Edo Maajka - Sevdah o rodama"; screenwriter and director: Silvio Mirošničenko, Croatia, 2007</ref> After the war, he returned to [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] to study criminal law in [[Tuzla]], but never graduated.<ref name="sevdah_o_rodama" />

He took an interest in hip-hop when he was in high school and began to do rap battling at the age of fifteen. He also recorded a few demo tracks, creating his own instrumentals by [[beatboxing]]. He went to [[Tuzla]] and became a member of the hardcore rap group Diskord, later named Odbrana (Defence in Bosnian). The group became one of the best in the city of Tuzla and all of Bosnia. Their demo single "Odbrana '99" (Defence '99) was the hit of the year on the "Radio Hit" station in [[Brčko (city)|Brčko]].<ref name="sevdah_o_rodama"/>

After a year of studying, he left school due to financial problems and returned to Zagreb to meet a friend (from the group [[Elemental (music group)|Elemental]]) and recorded his first single "Minimalni rizik" (Minimum Risk) and, a month later, "Mahir i Alma". The songs were top hits on the Zagreb "Radio 101" station's show "Blackout" and the response was enthusiastic. The demo, "Mahir i Alma", became Kameleon's hit of 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edomaajka.com/biografija/ |title=Biography |author=Edo Maajka |date=17 September 2011 |publisher=edomaajka.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fmjam.com/crew/edo-maajka |title=Edo Maajka |author=Fmjam |date=17 September 2011 |publisher=Fmjam.com }}</ref>

==Artistry==
===Influences and rapping technique===
Osmić has named several artists that have influenced him, including [[Rambo Amadeus]], [[The Beat Fleet|TBF]], [[Safet Isović]], [[Miladin Šobić]], [[Azra]], [[Zabranjeno Pušenje]], [[Disciplina Kičme]], [[Atomsko Sklonište]], [[Majke]], [[Rupa u Zidu]] among others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edomaajka.com/biografija/ |title=Biography page |author=Edo Maajka |date=17 September 2011 |publisher=edomaajka.com}}</ref>

His rapping technique is described as having a perfect flow,<ref name="Rofellos">{{cite web |url=http://www.hhunity.org/tekstovi/recenzije/edo-maajka-slusaj-mater.html |title=Edo Maajka - Slušaj Mater |author=Rofellos |date=17 September 2011 |publisher=.hhunity.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316082543/http://www.hhunity.org/tekstovi/recenzije/edo-maajka-slusaj-mater.html |archive-date=16 March 2012 }}</ref> also his varied subject matter, connecting with his audience, carrying a concept over a series of albums and got most praised for his ability to write brilliant lyrics.<ref name="Rofellos"/>

His lyrics have also been described as a variation in connecting emotionally to the viewer. As [[Anur Hadžiomerspahić]] says "once you start listening to a Edo Maajka song, when you first start listening it hits you, gives you goosebumps and grabs you by the throat, then the very next verse makes you laugh''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost/79332/ |title=Radiosarajevo.ba |author=Lejla Čolak |date=19 April 2012 |publisher=radiosarajevo.ba |access-date=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421203454/http://www.radiosarajevo.ba/novost/79332 |archive-date=21 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Business ventures===
In September 2006, Osmić opened up a cafe bar called "No sikiriki", named after his second album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superbosna.com/vijesti/muzika_i_film/edo_maajka_u_zagrebu_otvara_kafi%E6_%22no_sikiriki%22/ |title=Edo Maajka u Zagrebu otvara kafić "No sikiriki"  |author=Portal superbosna |date=4 September 2006 |publisher=Superbosna}}</ref> Along with beverages, the cafe also serves his favorite food, [[ćevapi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/edo-maajka-otvorio-kafic-no-sikiriki/154880/ |title=Edo Maajka otvorio kafić No sikiriki |author=Portal Jutarnji.hr |date=17 September 2006 |publisher=Jutarnji list |access-date=5 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426154522/http://www.jutarnji.hr/edo-maajka-otvorio-kafic-no-sikiriki/154880/ |archive-date=26 April 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Along with the cafe bar, he also plans to publish a weekly  magazine which will only focus on positive things that are happening in everyday life and the music scene.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/edo-maajka-na-tresnjevci-otvara-kafic-no-sikiriki/153073/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802183429/http://www.jutarnji.hr/edo-maajka-na-tresnjevci-otvara-kafic-no-sikiriki/153073/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Edo Maajka na Trešnjevci otvara kafić No sikiriki |author=Portal Jutarnji.hr |date=2 September 2006 |publisher=Jutarnji list }}</ref>

===Legal issues===
Osmić released his first single and music video for his third album, named ''[[To mora da je ljubav]]'', before his album came out, in which his producer [[Koolade]] used the song "[[Cissy Strut]]" from 1969 by [[The Meters]]. Some media outlets{{Who|date=October 2011}} have criticized him for plagiarizing the music in the song. Osmić answered back by saying "Sampling is not stealing. In hip hop you sample music, you take someones beat and rap on that beat. My album was postponed 1 week just because of that reason, while we waited for the authorization to use that song. The fact is that sometimes this waiting for authorization can be as long as one year, we redid the beat a little, gave credit to the author and not on us. You can see that the credit goes to the author on the inside cover of the album. Hip hop is made up of sampling, that is normal. On this particular track, Koolade is not named as the beat maker, but the author is.<ref name="Mean25"/> Remi, who is featured on the song, also gave a comment on the issue, saying that "That is not stealing, we are dealing with sampling of a already made song. You take one part of a song and combine it with your text. People who are not in hip hop don't usually know that this is a practice in this type of music.<ref name="Mean25">{{cite web |url=http://www.hhunity.org/vijesti/obavijesti/nepoznavatelji-hip-hopa-optuzili-edu-maajku-za-kradu.html |title=Nepoznavatelji Hip-Hopa optuzili Edu Maajku za kradu |author=Mean25 |date=12 March 2006 |publisher=Hip hop Unity |access-date=5 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422014828/http://www.hhunity.org/vijesti/obavijesti/nepoznavatelji-hip-hopa-optuzili-edu-maajku-za-kradu.html |archive-date=22 April 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Sports Hall Incident===
Osmić held a concert in the Sports Hall ([[Dom sportova]]) in 2005. The sponsor for the concert was T-mobile Croatia. Osmić held a press conference before the concert where he criticized his sponsors for the firing of workers after they changed their "brand".<ref name="Mean25"/> He also explained his decision  to work with a telecommunications monopoly by saying that he wanted his ticket for his concert to be 45 kuna or less.<ref name="Mean25"/> He added "you can only do that with a compromise, no one is criticizing [[Hladno Pivo]] that they sold out because their sponsor for the tour was Ozujsko beer, whose owners are also foreigners".<ref name="Mean25"/>

===Concert in Serbia controversy===
Bassivity (music label that released Osmić's album in Serbia) promoted Osmić's concert, which he was unaware of. When Osmić was asked about this in an interview for Svet magazine, he replied "I don't know where this idea that I will promote my album in Belgrade came from? "Bassivity" did that promotion on their own. I don't plan to go to Serbia, at least in the coming months. I don't want to go to a country that promotes the burning of mosques, and yet thousands of young people are howling on the streets. If I come to Serbia for an album promotion, which I promised to do, I am sure that it will not be for a while."<ref name="index.hr">{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/edo-maajka-necu-promovirati-album-u-zemlji-u-kojoj-pale-dzamije/203666.aspx |title=I don't want to promote my album in where they burn mosques|author=Mean25  |date=23 May 2005 |publisher=Index }}</ref> Svet also tried to bring some of Osmić mistakes from the past to light, in which they stated that he was supposed to have concert with [[Mile Kitić]], but they never revealed the source for that.<ref name="index.hr"/> In the same interview, Svet made some untrue and false accusations against Osmić and his family, saying that his brother and sister "live from black marketing in Northern Bosnia" and that his close family live of pirate sales from his own albums.<ref name="index.hr"/>

===UNICEF's Education Action in Bosnia===
Osmić was one of three artists that was featured in UNICEF's education program in Bosnia against [[HIV/AIDS]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.index.hr/xmag/clanak/edo-maajka-kabanicom-protiv-aidsa/174291.aspx |title=Edo Maajkla against AIDS |author=Index |date=5 December 2003 |publisher=Index }}</ref>

===Refusal to air music video===
At the end of November 2005, a month after Osmić premiered his video for the single ''Mater Vam Jebem'' on MTV Adria, HTV and Nova TV refused to air that video spot based on the name of the song and some theorized because the song's lyrics were critical of the countries leaders and the media.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edomaajka.com/info/show/3/ |title=EDO se nece emitirati na HTV-u i NOVOJ TV |author=Edo Maajka's publicist |date=21 November 2005 |publisher=edomaajka.com}}</ref>
