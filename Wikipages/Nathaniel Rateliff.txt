==Career==
Rateliff was born in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], on October 7, 1978. He grew up in rural Missouri, learning to play the drums at age seven. As a teenager he taught himself guitar, began writing songs and, at eighteen, moved to Denver.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nathaniel Rateliff|url=http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_MS14018|publisher=SXSW, Inc.|access-date=February 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926034540/http://schedule.sxsw.com/2011/events/event_MS14018|archive-date=September 26, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== 2002–2008: Born in the Flood ===
In 2002, Rateliff formed Born in the Flood, quickly garnering a large following in Denver and headlining local festivals like the [[Westword Music Showcase]]. In February 2007, Born in the Flood released their first full-length album ''If This Thing Should Spill''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaffeinebuzz.com/film/item/12385-born-in-the-flood-if-this-thing-should-spill|title=Born In The Flood – If This Thing Should Spill|website=kaffeinebuzz.com}}</ref> Despite increasing success with Born in the Flood, Rateliff turned down an offer from Roadrunner Records, and shifted his focus to a more stripped-down, solo effort, playing somber, singer-songwriter content under his name and "Nathaniel Rateliff and the Wheel".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2009/11/05/nathaniel-rateliff-of-denver-band-the-wheel-picks-quiet-route-to-success/|title=Nathaniel Rateliff of Denver band The Wheel picks quiet route to success – The Denver Post|website=denverpost.com|date=November 5, 2009}}</ref>

In 2007, while still performing with Born in the Flood, Rateliff began recording and performing more personal, somber content both solo and with BitF bandmate and lifetime collaborator Joseph Pope III (bass/guitar/vibes/organ/harmonica). The project expanded with more live performances, adding Julie Davis (upright bass/vocals), Carrie Beeder (organ/violin), James Han (keys/vibes), and Ben Desoto (drums/flute).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2009/11/05/nathaniel-rateliff-of-denver-band-the-wheel-picks-quiet-route-to-success/|title=Nathaniel Rateliff of Denver band The Wheel picks quiet route to success – The Denver Post|website=DenverPost|date=November 5, 2009|publisher=The Denver Post|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> Shortly after the breakup of Born in the Flood, Rateliff released ''Desire and Dissolving Men'' on Public Service Records.
