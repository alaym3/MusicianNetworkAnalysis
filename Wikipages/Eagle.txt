'''Eagle''' is the common name for many large [[Bird of prey|birds of prey]] of the family [[Accipitridae]]. Eagles belong to several groups of [[Genus|genera]], some of which are closely related. Most of the 60 species of eagle are from Eurasia and Africa.<ref>del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Sargatal, J. (editors). (1994). ''[[Handbook of the Birds of the World]] Volume 2'': New World Vultures to Guineafowl. Lynx Edicions. {{ISBN|84-87334-15-6}}</ref> Outside this area, just 14 species can be found—2 in North America, 9 in Central and South America, and 3 in Australia.

Eagles are not a natural group but denote essentially any [[bird of prey]] large enough to hunt sizeable (about 50&nbsp;cm long or more overall) [[vertebrate]] prey.

==Description==
Eagles are large, powerfully built [[birds of prey]], with heavy heads and beaks. Even the smallest eagles, such as the [[booted eagle]] (''Aquila pennata''), which is comparable in size to a [[common buzzard]] (''Buteo buteo'') or [[red-tailed hawk]] (''B. jamaicensis''), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight – despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some [[vulture]]s. The smallest species of eagle is the [[South Nicobar serpent eagle]] (''Spilornis klossi''), at {{convert|450|g|lb|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked [[beak]]s for ripping flesh from their prey, strong, muscular legs, and powerful [[Claw|talons]]. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles' eyes are extremely powerful. It is estimated that the [[martial eagle]], whose eyes are more than two times larger than the human eye, has a [[visual acuity]] up to 8 times that of humans. This acuity enables eagles to spot potential prey from a very long distance.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shlaer|first=Robert|year=1972|title=An Eagle's Eye: Quality of the Retinal Image|journal=Science|volume=176|issue=4037|pages=920–922|doi=10.1126/science.176.4037.920|url=http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/library/papers/biology/eagle_eyes.pdf|access-date=16 April 2012|pmid=5033635|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130130226/http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~xinl/library/papers/biology/eagle_eyes.pdf|archive-date=30 November 2012|df=dmy-all|bibcode=1972Sci...176..920S|s2cid=8034443}}</ref> This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal [[diffraction]] (scattering) of the incoming light.

Eagles normally build their nests, called [[Bird nest|eyries]], in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The parents take no action to stop the killing.<ref name= gambo>{{cite book | last = Grambo | first = Rebecca L | title = Eagles | year = 2003 | publisher = Voyageur Press | isbn = 978-0-89658-363-4 | page = [https://archive.org/details/eagles00gram/page/32 32] | url = https://archive.org/details/eagles00gram/page/32 }}</ref><ref name= stinson>{{cite journal | last= Stinson | first= Christopher H| year=1979 | title= On the Selective Advantage of Fratricide in Raptors | journal= Evolution | volume= 33 | issue = 4| pages= 1219–1225 | doi =10.2307/2407480 | pmid= 28563923| jstor= 2407480}}</ref>
The dominant chick tends to be a female, as they are bigger than the male. It is said that eagles fly above clouds but this is not true. Eagles fly during storms and glide from the winds pressure. This saves the bird's energy. 
Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as [[apex predator]]s in the avian world. The type of prey varies by genus. The ''[[Haliaeetus]]'' and ''[[Ichthyophaga]]'' eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other [[water bird]]s, and are powerful [[Kleptoparasitism|kleptoparasites]] of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera ''[[Circaetus]]'', ''[[Bateleur|Terathopius]]'', and ''[[Spilornis]]'' predominantly prey on the great diversity of [[snake]]s found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus ''[[Aquila (genus)|Aquila]]'' are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized [[vertebrate]] they can catch. Where ''Aquila'' eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the [[Buteoninae|buteonine]] [[black-chested buzzard-eagle]] of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich genus ''[[Spizaetus]]'', live predominantly in woodlands and forests. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based on their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it, so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart.<ref name=RaptorsWorld>{{cite book|year=2001|title=Raptors of the World| publisher=[[Helm Identification Guides|Christopher Helm]]|location=London|isbn=0-7136-8026-1|author1=Ferguson-Lees, J. |author2=Christie, D. }}</ref>

The [[bald eagle]] is noted for having flown with the heaviest load verified to be carried by any flying bird, since one eagle flew with a {{convert|6.8|kg|lb|frac=4|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[mule deer]] fawn.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amazing Bird Records|publisher=Trails.com|access-date=20 July 2012|url=http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620215454/http://www.trails.com/arts/amazing-bird-records.aspx|archive-date=20 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> However, a few eagles may target prey considerably heavier than themselves; such prey is too heavy to fly with, thus it is either eaten at the site of the kill or taken in pieces back to a perch or nest.

<blockquote>
They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous – but not the Eagles.
</blockquote>

Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the [[condor]]s and some of the [[Old World vulture]]s are markedly larger. It is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass, or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large [[harpy eagle]], have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through densely forested habitats.<ref name=" RaptorsWorld"/> Eagles in the genus ''Aquila'', found almost exclusively in open country, are noted for their ability to soar, and have relatively long wings for their size.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

These lists of the top five eagles are based on weight, length, and wingspan, respectively. Unless otherwise noted by reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide ''Raptors of the World''<ref>Ferguson-Lees, et al.)</ref> in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.<ref name=RaptorsWorld/>

==Groups==
Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.{{efn|"There are four major groups of eagles: fish eagles, booted eagles, snake eagles and giant forest eagles."<ref name=aae>{{cite web|last=Stalcup|first=Carolyn|title=All About Eagles|url=http://www.eagles.org/programs/eagle-facts/all-about-eagles.php|publisher=The American Eagle Foundation|access-date=25 May 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714180316/http://www.eagles.org/programs/eagle-facts/all-about-eagles.php|archive-date=14 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>}}<ref name=rutledge>{{cite web|last1=Rutledge|first1=Hope|title=Eagles of the World|url=http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle6.html|website=American Bald Eagle Information|access-date=11 June 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528060325/http://www.baldeagleinfo.com/eagle/eagle6.html|archive-date=28 May 2014|df=dmy-all}} from {{cite book|last1=Grambo|first1=Rebecca L.|title=Eagles|url=https://archive.org/details/eagles00gram|url-access=registration|date=1999|publisher=Voyageur Press, Inc.|isbn=9780896583634}}</ref>

The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily [[Circaetinae]]. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily [[Buteoninae]] together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner & Mindell<ref name=LM2005 /> proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of [[Accipitridae]].

===Fish eagles===
Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion.

Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: ''[[Haliaeetus]]'', ''[[Ichthyophaga]]''.

Some authors include ''Gypohierax angolensis'', the "vulturine fish eagle" (also called the [[palm-nut vulture]]) in this group.<ref name=rutledge /> However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of ''Neophron''–''Gypaetus''–''Eutriorchis'' ([[Egyptian vulture]], [[bearded vulture]] (lammergeier), and [[Madagascar serpent eagle]]).<ref name="tol-acciptridae" />

The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with ''[[Haliastur]]'' and ''[[Milvus]]''; the whole group is only distantly related to the ''Buteo'' group.<ref name="tol-acciptridae" />

===Booted eagles===

See comments under [[#Species|eagle species]] for changes to the composition of these genera.

===Snake eagles===
Snake or serpent eagles are, as the name suggests, adapted to hunting reptiles.

* Subfamily [[Circaetinae]]. Genera: ''Circaetus'', ''Spilornis'', ''Dryotriorchis'', ''Terathopius''.<ref name=rutledge />
* ''Eutriorchis'' (subfamily Gypaetinae or Circaetinae).

Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the [[Madagascar serpent eagle]] (''Eutriorchis'') is not related to them.<ref name="tol-acciptridae" />

===Harpy eagles===
Harpy eagles<ref name=rutledge /> or "giant forest eagles"<ref name=aae /> are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches and have traditionally been grouped, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black hawks and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles.

* Harpy eagles (proposed subfamily Harpiinae)
** ''Harpia harpyja'', [[harpy eagle]] ― Central and South America.
** ''Morphnus guianensis'', [[crested eagle]] ― Central and South America.
** ''Harpyopsis novaeguineae'', [[Papuan eagle]] ― New Guinea.
* Philippine eagle
** ''Pithecophaga jefferyi'', [[Philippine eagle]] ― Philippines.
* Solitary eagles
** [[Chaco eagle]] or crowned solitary eagle, ''[[Buteogallus]]'' (formerly ''[[Harpyhaliaetus]]'') ''coronatus'' ― South America.
** [[Solitary eagle]] or montane solitary eagle, ''[[Buteogallus]]'' (formerly ''[[Harpyhaliaetus]]'') ''solitarius'' ― South America.

Major new research into eagle [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] suggests that the important genera ''Aquila'' and ''Hieraaetus'' are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to ''Lophaetus'' or ''Ictinaetus''.<ref name=LM2005>{{cite journal|last=Lerner|first=H.

===Etymology===
The modern English term for the bird is derived from {{lang-la|[[wikt:aquila#Latin|aquila]]}} by way of {{lang-fr|[[wikt:aigle#French|aigle]]}}. The origin of {{lang|la|aquila}} is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from {{lang|la|[[wikt:aquilus#Latin|aquilus]]}} (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles.

[[Old English]] used the term {{lang|ang|[[wikt:earn#Old English|earn]]}}, related to Scandinavia's ''[[wikt:ørn|ørn]]/[[wikt:örn|örn]]''. It is similar to other [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] terms for "bird" or "eagle", including {{lang-el|[[wikt:ὄρνις#Ancient Greek|ὄρνις]]}} ({{transl|el|''ornís''}}), {{lang-ru|[[wikt:орёл#Russian|орёл]]}} ({{transl|ru|''orël''}}), and {{lang-cy|eryr}}.

In the southern part of [[Finland]], near the [[Gulf of Finland]], is the town of [[Kotka]], which literally means "eagle", while the town of [[L'Aquila]] in the central part of [[Italy]] literally means "the eagle".

In Britain before 1678, ''eagle'' referred specifically to the [[golden eagle]], with the other native species, the [[white-tailed eagle]], being known as [[wikt:erne#English|''erne'']]. The modern name "golden eagle" for ''aquila chrysaetos'' was introduced by the naturalist [[John Ray]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The village of [[Eagle, Lincolnshire|Eagle]] in [[Lincolnshire]], [[England]], has nothing to do with the bird; its name is derived from the Old English words for "oak" and "wood" (compare ''Oakley'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Reaney|first=P.H.|title=The Origin of English Place Names|edition=1964|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|page=166}}</ref>

The eagle is the patron animal of the [[Ancient Greek religion|ancient Greek god]] [[Zeus]]. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the [[Ganymede (mythology)]] page.)<ref>{{cite book |first=John |last=Hutchinson |title=Philosophical and Theological Works of the Late Truly Learned John Hutchinson |author-link=John Hutchinson (writer) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=14tPAAAAYAAJ |year=1749 |publisher=James Hedges |location=London, UK |page=402 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425203217/https://books.google.com/books?id=14tPAAAAYAAJ |archive-date=25 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Psalm 103]] (in Greek, Latin, and English) mentions renewing one's youth "as the eagle" (although the Hebrew word '''נשר''' apparently means [[vulture]]). [[Augustine of Hippo]] gives a curious explanation of this in his commentary on the Psalms.<ref>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf108.ii.CIII.html Psalm 103] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150508120622/http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf108.ii.CIII.html |date=8 May 2015 }} in Augustine's commentary.</ref>

An eagle is a common form in the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] tradition, often used to support the [[Bible]] because of the symbolism of spreading the [[gospel]] over the world. Additional symbolic meanings for "eagle" include the pronouncements to the [[Israelites]] in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 19:4; [[Psalms]] 103:5 and [[Book of Isaiah|Isaiah]] 40:31.

===Heraldry===

Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the "King of Birds" in contrast to the [[lion]], the "King of Beasts".  Whereas the lion (e.g. England) usually represents a kingdom, the eagle is symbolic of an empire. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries such as Austria, due to their association with the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, [[Eastern Roman Empire|East]] and [[Western Roman Empire|West]], of the old Roman Empire.  This motif, derived from the Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire was also adopted by the [[Russian Empire]] and is still featured in the [[Flag of Albania]]. The Roman eagle was preceded by the eagle of [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Egypt]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. In the coat of arms of [[Kotka]], Finland, the eagle is depicted carrying an [[anchor]] and the [[caduceus]] on its feet.

Heraldic eagles are most often found ''displayed'', i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur ''close'', i.e. with their wings folded, or ''rising'', i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently.
