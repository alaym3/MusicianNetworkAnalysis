== History ==

===Years as Vanguard and ''Dear G-d...'' (2011&ndash;2013)===
Being as an Ocean was originally named Vanguard, where they played extreme metal with a Christian message, however, as their sound was experimented with more, they began to lose interest in playing metal and instead pursued a more post-hardcore sound. Demo versions of the songs "The Hardest Part Is Forgetting Those You Swore You Would Never Forget" and "Humble Servant, Am I" were streamed on Vanguard's MySpace page on January 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/vanguardca/music/album/demo-songs-2011-17235785|title=Demo Songs 2011|date=January 4, 2011|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> The band thereafter changed their name to Being as an Ocean.

Guitarist Tyler Ross wrote the whole first album right after the band's formation. ''Dear G-d...'' was tracked in an old hotel called The Palms and was sent to Brian Hood to be mixed and mastered. The first single from the album was its title track, which was released on January 3, 2012, and was met with positive acclaim. Shortly after, Jacob Prest joined the band as rhythm guitarist. Being as an Ocean toured over twenty countries including Canada, Germany, Georgia, Austria, the United Kingdom and Australia with bands such as [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]], [[Hundredth (band)|Hundredth]], Sierra, [[Liferuiner]], [[Napoleon]], and [[The Elijah]]. They released a b-side from ''Dear G-d...'' titled "The People Who Share My Name" on August 5, 2013.

===Line-up changes, ''How We Both Wondrously Perish'' and self-titled album (2013&ndash;2015)===
In 2013, Shad Hamawe and Jacob Prest left the band to pursue lives outside of the band due to the intense touring schedule. The remaining members started recording as well as auditioning for new members. Connor Denis, of the [[hardcore punk]] band Sleep Patterns, joined the band as their new drummer. With this new line-up, they began writing and recording for their new album that would be released sometime in 2014. Michael McGough, of the [[post-hardcore]] band The Elijah, was also announced as the new guitarist for the band. On February 25, they revealed the album art of their second album, ''How We Both Wondrously Perish'' and announced its release date. A single from the album, "Death's Great Black Wing Scrapes the Air", was released on iTunes. The band recorded the album in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] at Glow in the Dark Studios and released it on May 6, 2014.

Shortly after, the band revealed that they were working on a third album that will be released in 2015. They played the entirety of 2015's [[Warped Tour]]. On May 7, they released "Little Richie", the first song from the new album and revealed the cover and release date for the album, which will be self-titled. The band released "Sleeping Sicarii", "Forgetting Is Forgiving the I", and "Sins of The Father" as additional singles. ''Being as an Ocean'' was released on June 29, 2015.

===''Waiting for Morning to Come'' (2015&ndash;present)===
On October 11, 2015, Tyler Ross revealed on his Twitter account that he was working on a new Being as an Ocean song.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tylerwross/status/653044542208262144|title=Tyler William Ross on Twitter|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> In a series of tweets, he confirmed that he was still working on that song, as well as another new song for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tylerwross/status/661138974585593856|title=Tyler William Ross on Twitter|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/tylerwross/status/661782748164698112|title=Tyler William Ross on Twitter|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> It has yet to be confirmed if these songs will be part of a fourth album, an EP or be released as stand-alone singles. On November 21, it was revealed that Connor Dennis was parting ways with the band in order to pursue a career as a professional session and touring drummer.

On February 25, the band released "Dissolve" as a stand-alone single, announcing their signing to Equal Vision Records and using Jesse Shelley (Sleepwave live drummer) as their new drummer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/-WgRisq28j/|title=Instagram post by Connor J.

During the last weeks of 2016, Being as an Ocean announced that their fourth studio album ''Waiting for Morning to Come'' would be released on June 9, 2017, however, the album did not meet this release date.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/beingasanocean/status/807731972206370816|title=-... .- .- --- on Twitter|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> It was met with an unexpected delay with no explanation given at the time by the band or Equal Vision why the album hadn't been released. On August 14, 2017, Tyler Ross confirmed that he had bought and secured the rights to the album and that the band would be releasing it independently on September 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/73642/news-being-as-an-ocean-leave-equal-vision-will-self-release-fourth-album|title=NEWS: Being As An Ocean leave Equal Vision; will self-release fourth album! |website=Dead Press! |access-date=August 19, 2017}}</ref> The band officially stated on their Facebook account on August 19 that they have become an independent band after buying out their contract with Equal Vision. The band would release two singles from the album in the weeks that followed, the first of these being "Thorns" and the second being "Black and Blue", which had been performed live prior to its release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/entry/being_as_an_ocean_black_and_blue_song_stream|title=Being as an Ocean debut striking new song, "Black & Blue"|publisher=Alternative Press|date=August 31, 2017}}</ref>
On July 20, 2018 the band released the single "Alone".

In an interview with ''Dead Press!'' on November 4, 2018, whilst touring in London as part of the Impericon Never Say Die! Tour, Michael McGough confirmed that the band had recorded a new album with 11 tracks, and expect to release it early 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview-being-as-an-ocean-04-11-2018|title=INTERVIEW: Being As An Ocean (04/11/2018) |website=Dead Press! |access-date=November 13, 2018}}</ref>

== Musical style and influences ==
The band's musical style has been described as [[post-hardcore]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Heaney|first=Gregory|title=Being as an Ocean: How We Both Wondrously Perish|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/how-we-both-wondrously-perish-mw0002637307|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=May 8, 2015|quote=On their second album, Being as an Ocean ...

"showcased a lot of human emotion through its ultra-personal lyricism, ''How We Both Wondrously Perish'' unleashed much of its emotion in shining musicality, as the group tightened up their instrumentation and added new dynamics to their sound – the biggest being the addition of guitarist/clean vocalist Michael McGough".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mindequalsblown.net/reviews/being-as-an-ocean-being-as-an-ocean|title=Being As An Ocean: Being As An Ocean - Mind Equals Blown|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref>

The lyrics for their debut album, referred to as "heartfelt", talk about life experiences, emotions, ideas and conversations Quartuccio "had about G-d, hope, love, humility, strength, pain, depression, loss and Life".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/dreambound/dreambound-interview-with-being-as-an-ocean-may-2012/413620988661391|title=Dreambound: Interview with Being As An Ocean (May 2012)|access-date=March 18, 2017}}</ref> Throughout the later albums, these continue to be the principal inspiration for the lyrics. Although they are often considered a [[Christian music|Christian band]], they denied that, saying that they are "Christian people who love to write music" and would prefer not to be placed under the "Christian band" tag.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Some of the early influences to their sound were MewithoutYou, [[Sigur Rós]], [[Oceana (band)|Oceana]], [[Bring Me the Horizon]], [[Listener (band)|Listener]], [[Verse (band)|Verse]], [[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]], [[Underoath]], [[Touché Amoré]], and La Dispute. The band's name was influenced by a quote spoken by [[Mahatma Gandhi]]; "You must not lose faith in humanity. Humanity is like an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty".<ref>{{cite web|title=Being As An Ocean (Answered by Tyler)|publisher=Vents Magazine|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/being-as-an-ocean-answered-by-tyler/|access-date=2019-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202120649/http://ventsmagazine.com/being-as-an-ocean-answered-by-tyler/|archive-date=2014-02-02|last=RJ Frometa|date=2012-10-25}}</ref>
