'''Galaxie 500''' was an American [[alternative rock]] band that formed in 1987 and split up in 1991 after releasing three albums: ''[[Today (Galaxie 500 album)|Today]]'', ''[[On Fire (Galaxie 500 album)|On Fire]]'' and ''[[This Is Our Music (Galaxie 500 album)|This Is Our Music]]''.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=2021-05-11|first1=Alexis|last1=Petridis|authorlink=Alexis Petridis|title=Galaxie 500: Today/On Fire/This Is Our Music|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/mar/11/galaxie-500-cd-review|date=11 March 2010|website=The Guardian}}</ref> The band was made up of guitarist/vocalist [[Dean Wareham]], drummer [[Damon Krukowski]] and bassist [[Naomi Yang]].

==History==
Guitarist [[Dean Wareham]], drummer [[Damon Krukowski]] and bassist [[Naomi Yang]] had met at the [[Dalton School]] in New York City in 1981, but began playing together during their time as students at [[Harvard University]].<ref name="Ankeny">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4331/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Galaxie 500 Biography |access-date=25 March 2008 |author=Ankeny, Jason |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref><ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Alternative & Indie Discography |url=https://archive.org/details/greatalternative0000stro |url-access=registration |year= 1999 |publisher=Canongate |isbn=0-86241-913-1 }}</ref><ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Colin |title=The Guinness Who's Who of Indie and New Wave Music |year= 1992 |publisher=Guinness Publishing|pages=120/1 |isbn=0-85112-579-4 }}</ref><ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2000) ''Alternative Rock'', Miller Freeman Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-607-6}}, p.380-381</ref> Wareham and Krukowski had formed a series of punk-influenced student bands, before Wareham returned to New York.<ref name="Thompson" /> When he returned in 1987 he and Krukowski formed a new band, with Yang joining the group on bass guitar, the new group deciding on the name Galaxie 500, after a friend's car, a [[Ford Galaxie|Ford Galaxie 500]].

The band began playing gigs in Boston and New York City, and recorded a demo which they sent to ''[[Shimmy Disc]]'' label boss and producer [[Mark Kramer]], who agreed to produce the band.<ref name="Ankeny" /> With Kramer at the controls, the band recorded the "Tugboat" single in February 1988, and the "Oblivious" [[flexi-disc]], and moved on to record their debut album, ''Today'', which was released on the small ''Aurora'' label.<ref name="Strong" /> The band toured the United Kingdom in late 1988 and in 1989, then signed to [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] and released their second album, ''On Fire'', which has been described as "[[lo-fi (music)|lo-fi]] psychedelia reminiscent of [[Jonathan Richman]] being backed by [[The Velvet Underground]]",<ref name="Strong" /> and is considered the band's defining moment.<ref name="Ankeny" /> ''On Fire'' reached number 7 in the [[UK Indie Chart]], and met with much critical acclaim in the United Kingdom, but was less well received by the US music press, who cited Wareham's 'vocal limitations' as a weakness.<ref name="Buckley">{{cite book |last=Buckley |first=Peter |title=The Rough Guide to Rock |url=https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/408 |year=2003 |publisher=Rough Guides |isbn=1-84353-105-4 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/roughguidetorock0003unse/page/408 408–409] }}</ref><ref name="Lazell">{{cite book |last=Lazell |first=Barry |title=Indie Hits 1980-1999 |year= 1997 |publisher=Cherry Red Books |isbn=0-9517206-9-4 }}</ref>

Galaxie 500 recorded two sessions for [[John Peel]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] programme, these later released on the ''Peel Sessions'' album. Their cover of Jonathan Richman's "Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste" was also voted into number 41 in 1989's [[Festive 50]] by listeners to the show.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/g/galaxie500/|title=Keeping It Peel : Galaxie 500 |access-date=25 March 2008 |work=Keeping It Peel |publisher=BBC }}</ref>

The band split up in the spring of 1991 after the release of their third album, ''This Is Our Music.'' Wareham, who had already moved back to New York, quit the band after a lengthy American tour, as preparations were underway for a tour of Japan.<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="Larkin" /><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=McGonigal|first=Mike|date=2010-05-10|title=Temperature's Rising: Galaxie 500|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/article/7792-temperatures-rising-galaxie-500/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-10-25|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Andy on 5 April 2021|title=GALAXIE 500 have split (30 years on)|url=https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2021/04/05/the-end-of-galaxie-500-30-years-on/|access-date=2021-10-25|website=A Head Full of Wishes|language=en}}</ref> As Wareham later said, "Galaxie 500 broke up because it was time. We broke up as a result of internal contradictions. Columbia Records was interested in signing us, but the making of the previous album had been very difficult--and clearly we weren't getting along--so why should we continue to sit in a room and make music together?"<ref name=":0" />

Galaxie 500's records were released in the US and UK on the independent Rough Trade label. When Rough Trade went bankrupt in 1991, Krukowski and Yang purchased the masters at auction, reissuing them on [[Rykodisc]] in 1996 as a box set containing all three albums and another disc of rarities.<ref>Rosen, Craig. (October 5, 1996). [https://books.google.com/books?id=0QkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 "Galaxie 500 Catalog Rises again with Rykodisc Box."] ''Billboard'', pp. 14, 15, 19, volume 108, number 40.</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Galaxie 500 used fairly simple instrumental techniques enhanced with an atmospheric production style. [[The Velvet Underground]] and [[Jonathan Richman]] have been identified as key influences.<ref name="Strong" /><ref name="Buckley" /> In interviews on the Galaxie 500 DVD ''Don't Let Our Youth Go to Waste'', Wareham cites [[Spacemen 3]] as another key inspiration.

==Post-Galaxie 500 activities==
After leaving Galaxie 500, Wareham tried his hand at production, working with [[Mercury Rev]]. He released a solo single, "Anesthesia," in February 1992, and formed a new band, [[Luna (1990s American band)|Luna]]. Krukowski and Yang continued to record under the moniker Pierre Etoile (French for "Rock Star"), and then [[Damon and Naomi]] (whose first two releases were also produced by Kramer), and as members of [[Magic Hour (band)|Magic Hour]].<ref name="Strong" /> They also began the avant-garde press [[Exact Change]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100115061957/http://www.exactchange.com/frame/frame.html?http://www.exactchange.com/aboutec/about.html] {{dead link|date=June 2021}}</ref>

In June 2010 Wareham announced on his website that he would be going on an autumn tour under the moniker "Dean Wareham plays Galaxie 500," where he would, as the moniker suggests, only play Galaxie 500 songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=668|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910030203/http://www.deanandbritta.com/blog/?p=668|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 10, 2010|title=Dean & Britta » Blog Archive » D&B band plays Galaxie 500 shows|date=September 10, 2010}}</ref>

==Influence==
Galaxie 500's music had an influence on many later [[indie music]] groups, including [[Low (band)|Low]].<ref name="Buckley" /> Their music has been covered and referenced by several well known artists. In [[Liz Phair]]'s song "Stratford-on-Guy", she sings, "And I was pretending that I was in a Galaxie 500 video."  In [[Xiu Xiu]]'s song "Dr. Troll", [[Jamie Stewart (singer)|Jamie Stewart]] sings, "Listen to ''[[On Fire (Galaxie 500 album)|On Fire]]'' and pretend someone could love you." On [[Neutral Milk Hotel]]'s debut album, ''[[On Avery Island]]'', the song "Naomi" is believed to be about Naomi Yang, and includes the line "There is no Naomi in view/She walks through Cambridge stocks and strolls"; in 2011, Yang created a music video for the song.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/44646-watch-galaxie-500s-naomi-yang-makes-a-video-for-neutral-milk-hotels-naomi/ |title=Watch: Galaxie 500's Naomi Yang Makes a Video for Neutral Milk Hotel's "Naomi" &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2011-11-15 |access-date=2016-03-11}}</ref> [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]]'s ''[[And This Is Our Music]]'' was titled in reference to the group's album ''This Is Our Music'' (which itself was titled after [[Ornette Coleman]]'s album ''[[This Is Our Music (Ornette Coleman album)|This Is Our Music]]'').<ref name="Buckley" /> [[Sonic Youth]] frontman [[Thurston Moore]] has cited Galaxie 500's album ''[[Today (Galaxie 500 album)|Today]]'' as "the guitar record of 1988".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.noripcord.com/?q=node/190 |title=Galaxie 500 "Uncollected" (review) |access-date=25 March 2008 |author=Bollig, Ben |date=October 2004 |work=No Ripcord }}</ref>

"Tugboat" has been covered by many artists, including [[The Submarines]], who recorded it with indie rock producer [[Adam Lasus]] for their ''iTunes Live Session EP'', [[British Sea Power]], on Rough Trade compilation ''[[Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before...]]'', Welsh lo-fi band [[Joanna Gruesome]], and [[Portastatic]], Kiwi Jr., for a planned concert of Galaxie 500 covers at Rough Trade Brooklyn set to coincide with Record Store Day and the release of Galaxie’s Copenhagen on vinyl. In 2010 the bands Cloudland Canyon and [[Citay]], appeared on a 7" EP together wherein they both covered Galaxie 500, the former taking on "Temperature's Rising" and the latter doing a version of "Tugboat". English artist World Of Fox covered "Flowers" in his 2011 release on Where It's At Is Where You Are Records.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In 2012 the song "Tugboat" was featured in the film ''[[The Perks of Being a Wallflower (film)|The Perks of Being a Wallflower]]'', directed by [[Stephen Chbosky]] and based on his book of the same name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2012/08/perks-of-being-a-wallflower-soundtrack-features-sonic-youth-galaxie-500-david-bowie-the-smiths-more-107018/ |title='Perks Of Being A Wallflower' Soundtrack Features Sonic Youth, Galaxie 500, David Bowie, The Smiths & More |access-date=21 January 2019 |author=Jagernauth, Kevin |date=August 2012 |work=IndieWire }}</ref>
