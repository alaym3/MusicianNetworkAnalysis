The '''Baha Men''' are a [[Music of the Bahamas|Bahamian]] [[junkanoo]] band formed in [[New Providence]] in 1977. They are best known for their [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Grammy Award]]-winning hit song "[[Who Let the Dogs Out]]".

==History==
The Baha Men formed in 1977<ref name="Vicebaha"/> as High Voltage, initially playing [[disco]] and [[funk]].<ref name="Thompson">Thompson, Dave (2002) ''Reggae & Caribbean Music'', Backbeat Books, {{ISBN|0-87930-655-6}}, pp.28–29</ref> They performed regularly in nightclubs and hotels in the Bahamas and self-released several albums.<ref name="Thompson" />

In 1991, one of their tapes found its way to [[Atlantic Records]] A&R man [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]], who signed the band to the Big Beat subsidiary, at the same time getting the band to change their name to the Baha Men.<ref name="Thompson" />

The following year, the Baha Men released their first album, ''[[Junkanoo (album)|Junkanoo]],'' which included the local hit "Back to the Island".<ref name="Thompson" /> ''Kalik'' followed in 1994, including the international hit "Dancing in the Moonlight".<ref name="Thompson" /> The band moved with Greenberg to [[PolyGram|Polygram]] for the 1997 album ''[[I Like What I Like]]'' and ''[[Doong Spank]]'', released the following year.<ref name="Thompson" /> The latter sold only 700 copies in the US and the band was dropped by the label.

Greenberg then started his own label, S-Curve, and signed the band.<ref name="Thompson" /> Original vocalist Nehemiah Hield left in 1999, and was replaced by his nephew Omerit.<ref name="Thompson" /> The band was most popular in the 1990s in Japan, and their 1999 album ''[[2 Zero 0-0]]'' was initially only released in that country.<ref name="Thompson" />

They achieved great, but short-lived, popularity with 2000's remake of "[[Who Let the Dogs Out (song)|Who Let the Dogs Out]]" (originally composed by [[Anslem Douglas]]), produced by Greenberg and Michael Mangini.<ref name="Thompson" /> The song was a chart success in many countries and also became a popular song at US sporting events.<ref name="Thompson" /> "Who Let the Dogs Out" also earned the band several awards: a [[Grammy Award]] in 2001 for [[Best Dance Recording]];<ref name="Thompson" /> [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard Music Awards'']] for World Music Artist of the Year and World Music Album of the Year; and a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award]] for Favorite Song. In 2002, they won another Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Band.

In June 2008, "Who Let the Dogs Out" was discussed on ''[[I Love the New Millennium]]''. The Baha Men's most recent [[record album|album]] was ''[[Ride with Me (Baha Men album)|Ride With Me]]'', released in 2015.

After releasing ''Night & Day'' in the summer of 2014, the Baha Men released a Christmas Medley mixing "[[The Little Drummer Boy]]" with "[[Silver Bells]]". Their single "Off the Leash" was released digitally on 1 July 2015. On 25 October 2015, the band performed the halftime show for the [[New York Giants]]/[[Dallas Cowboys]] football game at [[MetLife Stadium]].

In 2018, the group joined [[Our Last Night]] for a metal cover of their hit song "[[Who Let the Dogs Out (song)|Who Let the Dogs Out]]".

In April 2019, the Baha Men released a new single, "Let's Go",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://top40-charts.com/news.php?nid=145701|title=The Baha Men Returns With Surprise New Single, 'Let's Go'|date=2019-04-06|website=Top40-Charts.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-08}}</ref> dedicated to the [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Final Four|teams playing in the Final Four]].

==Involvement in motion pictures==
The Baha Men were one of the many artists to record a song on the album ''[[Disneymania|DisneyMania]]'' and two of its four sequels.

On ''[[Disneymania 2]]'', they recorded the song "It's a Small World" from the Disney park attraction of the [[It's a Small World|same name]].

They also recorded the theme song to the Disney TV show, ''[[Stanley (2001 TV series)|Stanley]]''. A number of their songs have been used in major motion pictures such as ''[[Rugrats in Paris: The Movie]]'', ''[[The Little Vampire (film)|The Little Vampire]]'', ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'', ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'', ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'', and ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]''. They also recorded a cover of [[Elton John]]'s hit "[[Crocodile Rock]]" for the film ''[[The Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'' starring [[Steve Irwin]] and family. The band has even made an appearance on the big screen, when they starred as themselves in the 1994 romantic comedy ''[[My Father the Hero (1994 film)|My Father the Hero]]'' starring [[Gérard Depardieu]] and [[Katherine Heigl]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/bahamen.htm |title=Pop Entertainment Baha Men |publisher=Popentertainment.com |access-date=2010-10-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219135124/http://popentertainment.com/BahaMen.htm |archive-date=2010-12-19 }}</ref> The Baha Men also were featured in the soundtrack of ''[[Shrek]]'' with their hit song "Best Years of Our Lives".
