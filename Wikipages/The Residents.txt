'''The Residents''' are an American [[art collective]] best known for their [[avant-garde music]] and [[multimedia]] works. Since their first official release, ''[[Meet the Residents]]'' (1974), they have released over 60 albums, numerous music videos and short films, three [[CD-ROM]] projects, and ten [[DVD]]s. They have undertaken seven major world tours and [[film score|scored]] multiple films. Pioneers in exploring the potential of CD-ROM and similar technologies, the Residents have won several awards for their multimedia projects. They founded [[Ralph Records]], a [[record label]] focusing on avant-garde music, in 1972.

Throughout the group's existence, the individual members have ostensibly attempted to work anonymously, preferring to have attention focused on their art. Much speculation and rumor has focused on this aspect of the group. In public, they appear silent and costumed, often wearing eyeball helmets, top hats and tails—a costume now recognized as their signature iconography. In 2017, [[Hardy Fox]], long known to be associated with the Residents, identified himself as the band's co-founder and primary composer; he died in 2018.

The Residents' albums generally fall into two categories: [[deconstruction]]s of Western [[popular music]], and complex [[concept album|conceptual pieces]] composed around a theme, theory or plot. The group is noted for [[surrealistic]] lyrics and sound, with a disregard for conventional [[music composition]].

==History==

===1965–1972: Origins and Residents Unincorporated===
[[File:Residents-circa-1969.png|thumb|right|The earliest known photograph of the group, circa 1969]]
The artists who became The Residents met in high school in [[Shreveport]], [[Louisiana]] in the early 1960s. Around 1965, they began making their first amateur home tape recordings and making art together with a number of friends. In 1966, intending to join the flourishing [[hippie]] movement, they headed west for San Francisco, but when their truck broke down in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]], [[California]] they decided to remain there.<ref>''Theory of Obscurity'' documentary</ref>

While attempting to make a living, the group purchased crude recording equipment and began to refine their recording and editing skills, as well as photography, painting, and anything remotely to do with art that they could afford. The Residents have acknowledged the existence of at least two unreleased reel-to-reel items from this era, titled ''The Ballad of Stuffed Trigger'' and ''Rusty Coathangers for the Doctor''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Strong| first  = Martin Charles| author-link = Martin C. Strong| title = The Great Rock Discography| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=2bxf_kPsUucC&q=%22the+ballad+of+stuffed+trigger%22+the+residents&pg=PA1281 | access-date = January 8, 2013| date = October 21, 2004| publisher = [[Canongate Books]]| isbn = 978-1841956152}}</ref> The Cryptic Corporation has confirmed that their archives contain many tapes dating back decades, but because they were recorded before the group officially became the Residents, the band does not consider them part of its discography.

Word of the unnamed group's experimentation spread, and in 1969 British guitarist and multi-instrumentalist Philip Lithman, known as [[Snakefinger]], began to participate with them.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p98827|label=Phil Lithman}}</ref> Around this time they also met the mysterious (and perhaps apocryphal) [[N. Senada]], whom Lithman had picked up during an expedition in [[Bavaria]]. The two Europeans became great influences and life-long collaborators with the group.

In 1971 the group sent a reel-to-reel demo tape to Hal Halverstadt at [[Warner Brothers]], as he had signed [[Captain Beefheart]], one of the group's heroes, to the label. Halverstadt was not impressed with ''[[The Warner Bros. Album]]'', but gave it an "A for Ariginality". Because the band had not included a name in the return address, the rejection slip was addressed to "Residents". The group decided to use this name, first becoming Residents Uninc., then shortening it to the current name.

The first known public performance of the Residents, Uninc. was at the Boarding House in San Francisco in 1971. The brief, guerrilla-style performance took the audience by surprise. A photo from it, showing Lithman playing violin with his pinky "about to strike the violin like a snake", originated the stage name he used for the rest of his life, [[Snakefinger]]. Later in 1971, a second tape was completed called ''Baby Sex'', featuring a long collage partially consisting of recordings from the Boarding House performance. The cover art for the tape box was a silk-screened copy of an old photo depicting a woman fellating a small child, an example of the extremely confrontational and deliberately puerile visual and lyrical style the group adopted during this period.

====Alleged early influence====
'''N. Senada''' (which may be a play on ''Ensenada'', ''en se nada'' meaning "in himself nothing," ''no sé nada'' meaning "I don't know anything" or ''enseñada'', a form of the [[past participle]] meaning "taught") was said to be a [[Bavarians|Bavarian]] [[composer]] and [[music theory|music theorist]] who formulated the "Theory of Obscurity" and the "Theory of Phonetic Organization". His "Theory of Obscurity" states that an artist can only produce pure art when the expectations and influences of the outside world are not taken into consideration;<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://themostevercompany.com/|title=The Most Ever Company|website=Themostevercompany.com|access-date=June 20, 2021}}</ref> while his "Theory of Phonetic Organization" states, "the musician should put the sounds first, building the music up from [them] rather than developing the music, then working down to the sounds that make it up."

There is a debate as to whether or not Senada, supposedly having been born in 1907 and dying in 1993 at the age of 86, actually existed, or was simply an invention of the Residents. It is frequently speculated that, if real, N. Senada may have been the famous avant-garde composer and instrument-designer [[Harry Partch]], the influence of whose work may be heard in Residents compositions such as "[[Fingerprince|Six Things to a Cycle]]"; his death is also referenced in the song "[[Babyfingers|Death in Barstow]]".  Another rumor speculates that N. Senada may have been [[Captain Beefheart]], because in the late 1960s Beefheart and his "Magic Band" lived in a residence on Ensenada Drive in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills]], California,<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=song|id=t2006600|pure_url=yes}} Review of "China Pig" from Allmusic]</ref> while recording ''[[Trout Mask Replica]]'' and ''[[Safe as Milk (album)|Safe as Milk]]''; Beefheart's influence can also be heard in early Residents works. The Residents also sent an early demo tape to the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] executive Hal Halverstadt who had signed Beefheart.

According to The Residents, in 1937, N. Senada premiered his masterpiece, ''[[Pollex Christi]]'', which means either ''Thumb of Christ'' or ''Big Toe of Christ''. This work mainly consisted of borrowed pieces from other composers, namely [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No 5 (Beethoven)|Symphony No. 5]]'' and [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', among others. He also left large holes in the work so that the performers could insert music of their choosing, thus "becoming composers themselves". Senada justified his work with "house" analogies claiming that he did not make the "bricks" but "cemented them together"; he was not the "architect", just the "builder".  N. Senada allegedly collaborated with The Residents on their work prior to "Santa Dog" and "Meet The Residents", and then disappeared. He resurfaced in the mid-1970s, returning from an Arctic expedition and bearing a sealed bottle of pure Arctic air; this served as inspiration for the ''[[Eskimo (album)|Eskimo]]'' project.

===1972–1980: "Classic" era===

====''Santa Dog'', ''Meet The Residents'', ''Not Available'' & ''The Third Reich 'n Roll'' (1972–1976)====
[[File:Residents-EnigmaticFoe1974.jpg|thumb|left|Still from the [[Not Available (album)|''Not Available'']] Sessions, 1974]]
In early 1972, the band left San Mateo and relocated to 20 Sycamore St, [[San Francisco]]; a studio they named "El Ralpho", which boasted a completely open ground floor (seemingly ideal for a sound stage), allowing the group to expand their operations and also begin preliminary work on their most ambitious project up to that point, a full-length film entitled ''[[Vileness Fats]]'', which consumed most of their attention for the next four years. Intended to be the first-ever long form music video, The Residents saw this project as an opportunity to create the ultimate [[cult film]]. After four years of filming (from 1972 to 1976) the project was reluctantly cancelled because of time, space, and monetary constraints. Fifteen hours of footage was shot for the project, yet only approximately 35 minutes of that footage has ever been released.

The group also formed [[Ralph Records]] at this time, as a small, independent label to release and promote their own work. In 1972, to inaugurate the new business, the group recorded and pressed the ''Santa Dog'' EP, their first recorded output to be released to the public. Designed to resemble a Christmas card from an insurance company, the EP consisted of two 7" singles, one song on each side. The four songs were presented as being by four different bands (Ivory & The Braineaters, Delta Nudes, the College Walkers, and Arf & Omega featuring the Singing Lawnchairs), with only a small note on the interior of the gatefold sleeve mentioning the participation of "Residents, Uninc."

They sent copies of ''Santa Dog'' to west coast radio stations with no response until Bill Reinhardt, program director of [[KBOO]]-FM in [[Portland, Oregon]] received a copy and played it heavily on his show. Reinhardt met the Residents at their studio at 20 Sycamore St.<ref name=Sycamore>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyno|url-access=registration|title=Rip it Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984|first=Simon|last=Reynolds|date=January 1, 2005|publisher=Penguin|access-date=November 16, 2016|page=[https://archive.org/details/ripitupstartagai00reyno/page/200 200]|quote=sent back addressed to "Residents, 20 Sycamore St., San Francisco|via=Internet Archive|isbn=9780143036722}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuralarts.com/neighborhood/mission/sycamore-street/11.html|title=San Francisco Mural Arts – Mission – Sycamore Street|website=Sfmuralarts.com|access-date=July 13, 2018}}</ref> in the summer of 1973 with the news of his broadcasts. The Residents gave Reinhardt exclusive access to all their recordings, including copies of the original masters of ''Stuffed Trigger'', ''Baby Sex'', and [[The Warner Bros. Album]].

Throughout this point, the group had been manipulating old tapes they had collected and regularly recording jam sessions, and these recordings eventually became the group's debut full-length album, ''[[Meet The Residents]]'', which was released in 1974 on Ralph. To aid in promoting the group, Reinhardt was given 50 of the first 1,000 copies of ''Meet the Residents''. Some were sent to friends, listeners and critics, and two dozen were left for sale on consignment at the [[Music Millennium]] record store, where they sat unsold for months. KBOO DJ Barry Schwam (a.k.a. Schwump, who also recorded with the Residents) promoted them on his program as well. Eventually, KBOO airplay attracted a cult following.[[File:TheResidents1976.jpg|thumb|The Residents, 1974 - 1976]]Following the release of ''Meet The Residents'', the group began working on a follow-up entitled ''[[Not Available (album)|Not Available]],'' following N. Senada's theory of obscurity. The LP was recorded and compiled completely in private, and would not be released until the group had completely forgotten about its existence.<ref>The Residents - [[Not Available (album)|Not Available]] Liner Notes [<nowiki/>[[East Side Digital]]] (ESD80192) 1988</ref>

During breaks in the sessions for ''Vileness Fats'', the group would record their next project, entitled ''[[The Third Reich 'n Roll]]'', over the course of a year between October 1974 and October 1975. The album consisted of two side-long [[medley (music)|medleys]] of the band covering popular songs from 1950s and 1960s, whilst toying with the concept of the popularity of [[rock 'n' roll]] being comparable to that of the rise of [[Nazism]] in the 1930s. The resulting LP was released in 1976, and was the group's first project to feature a [[music video]], created by syncing an old video of the group performing with an edited version of "Swastikas on Parade".<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Third Reich 'n' Roll - Historical - The Residents|url=https://residents.com/historical/?page=thirdreichandroll|access-date=2020-11-19|website=residents.com}}</ref>

After ''the Third Reich 'n Roll'''s release, a group of enterprising friends and collaborators from their early days in [[San Mateo, California|San Mateo]] — Homer Flynn, [[Hardy Fox]], Jay Clem and John Kennedy — also joined the group in San Francisco, forming what became the Cryptic Corporation to manage and represent the band. Clem became the band's spokesman; Fox edited, produced and compiled the band's increasingly prolific output; Flynn was already handling the group's cover design and promotional art under the banner of Pore Know Graphics; and Kennedy took the role of "President" (admittedly a fairly empty title, as overall responsibilities were handled more or less equally by the four). The Cryptic Corporation took over the day-to-day operations of Ralph Records, and provided the band with an improved public relations platform.

Shortly after the introduction of the Cryptic Corporation, the Residents recorded their "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]" single, the B-side of which featured the Residents' first work with the [[ARP Odyssey]], the first synthesizer owned by the group, purchased by the Cryptics.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Synth City {{!}} CODGERS ON THE MOON|url=http://hardyfox.com/public_html/codgers/page13/index.html|access-date=2020-11-19|website=hardyfox.com}}</ref>

====''Eskimo'', ''Fingerprince'', ''Duck Stab'', & Rise in popularity (1976–1979)====
Following "Satisfaction", the group began recording [[Eskimo (album)|''Eskimo'']] in April 1976; a concept album based upon the Theory of Phonetic Organisation that suggests that music should not be confined to chords and structures, but instead should simply be a collection of fascinating noises. The album would feature acoustic soundscapes inspired by Inuit culture,<ref>Eskimo Liner Notes (Ralph Records, ESK7906) [1979]
</ref> whilst parodying American ignorance of other cultures. The ''Eskimo'' sessions would last many years, and feature many divergences, the first of which, in November 1976, resulting in ''[[Fingerprince]]'', a collection of unused recordings from ''the Third Reich 'n Roll'', ''Not Available'', and ''Eskimo'' sessions.<ref>The Residents - Fingerprince Liner Notes, (Ralph Records RR1276) [1977]</ref>

''Fingerprince'' received considerable coverage in the British press, and was the first LP by the group to receive any critical attention when [[Jon Savage]] reviewed the album and its two predecessors favorably for the December 31st issue of [[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]] magazine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/residents-imeet-the-residents--third-reich-n-roll--finger-prince-i|title=Residents: Meet the Residents *****; Third Reich 'N' Roll *****; Finger Prince *****. By Jon Savage : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.|website=Rocksbackpages.com|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> This review gained the group considerable attention, with many of their previously unsold mail-order items being sold seemingly overnight.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Duck Stab / Buster & Glenn pREServed Liner Notes|last=Shirley|first=Ian|publisher=Pale Pachyderm Publishing|year=2018|pages=1}}</ref> The sudden success of ''Fingerprince'' and its predecessors caused the group to briefly halt production on ''Eskimo'' to create something more appealing to their newfound audience.

The Residents followed up ''Fingerprince'' with their ''[[Duck Stab!]]'' EP – their most accessible release up to that point. This EP got the band some attention from the press (namely ''[[NME]]'', ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' and ''[[Melody Maker]]''), and was followed in 1978 by the ''[[Duck Stab/Buster & Glen]]'' album, which paired the EP with a similar, concurrently recorded EP which had not been released separately. The group then continued work on ''[[Eskimo (album)|Eskimo]]'', which proved a very difficult project, marked by many conflicts between the band and their management, which led to a number of delays in the release date.

The sudden attention afforded to them by the success of the ''Duck Stab!'' EP and "Satisfaction" single required an album release as soon as possible to help fund the band's spiraling recording costs, and to meet the demand for new Residents material. This forced the release of the band's long-shelved "second album" ''[[Not Available]]'' in 1978. The Residents were not bothered by this deviation from the original plan not to release the album, as the 1978 release ultimately did not affect the philosophical conditions under which it was originally recorded.

''[[Eskimo (album)|Eskimo]]'' was finally released in 1979 to much acclaim, even making it to the final list for nominations for a Grammy award in 1980, although the album wasn't nominated. Rather than being songs in the orthodox sense, the compositions on ''Eskimo'' sounded like "live-action stories" without dialogue. The cover art of ''Eskimo'' also presents the first instance of the group wearing eyeball masks and tuxedos, which was later considered by many to be the group's signature costume. The Residents had only intended to wear these costumes for the cover of ''Eskimo'', but adopted the costumes in the longer term as it provided them with a unique and recognisable image.

The group followed ''Eskimo'' with ''[[Commercial Album]]'' in 1980. The LP featured 40 songs, each exactly one minute in length.<ref name="rf">{{cite book

}}</ref> Around this time, two short films were made in collaboration with [[Graeme Whifler]]: ''One Minute Movies'', consisting of four music videos for tracks from the ''Commercial Album''; and a video for "Hello Skinny" from the ''Duck Stab'' LP. Created at a time when MTV (and what later became known as "music video" in general) was in its infancy, the group's videos were in heavy rotation since they were among the few music videos available to broadcasters.

===1981–1990: New technology and live performances===

====''Mark of the Mole'' & The Mole Show (1981–1983)====
[[File:ResidentsMoleShowChub.png|thumb|right|The Mole Show Live, 1983]]
The Residents' follow up to Commercial Album was ''[[Mark of the Mole]]'', released in 1981. The album was a reaction to the group feeling betrayed by a suddenly disinterested music press.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mole Trilogy - Historical - The Residents|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=moletrilogy#markofthemole|access-date=2021-11-21|website=www.residents.com}}</ref>

Shortly after the release of ''Mark of the Mole'', The Residents purchased one of the first ever [[E-mu Emulator|E-Mu Emulator]] samplers, number #00005 specifically.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mole Trilogy - Historical - The Residents|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=moletrilogy#tunesoftwocities|access-date=2021-02-23|website=Residents.com}}</ref> The instrument was revolutionary for the band, as the sampling capacities of the keyboard not only allowed them to recreate instruments the members were not able to play,<ref>{{cite web|last=Flynn|first=Homer|date=19 July 2020|title=Homer Flynn Interview (Icky Flix Tour 2001)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=261&v=QJrGZp5uUn4&feature=youtu.be|url-status=live|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> but also gave them the opportunity to create their meticulously crafted studio sound in a live setting. The first album the band recorded using the emulator was ''[[The Tunes of Two Cities]],'' the second part of the Mole Trilogy, which was nearly entirely recorded using the Emulator.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Synth City {{!}} CODGERS ON THE MOON|url=http://hardyfox.com/public_html/codgers/page13/index.html|access-date=2021-02-23|website=hardyfox.com}}</ref>

Following the release of ''Cities'', the Residents started rehearsing for a possible live show, eventually developing their first touring project, the Mole Show, a theatrical retelling of their ''[[Mark of the Mole]]'' album. The band debuted the show with a test performance, on April 10, 1982, before a tour of California in October, and a European tour throughout mid 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mole Trilogy - Historical - The Residents|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=moletrilogy#moleshow|access-date=2021-02-23|website=Residents.com}}</ref> The show featured [[Penn Jillette]] as the narrator, playing a similar role as he had previously done with the Ralph Records 10th Anniversary radio special.

A third leg, featuring dates in New York, was booked, but had to be cancelled after one performance due to lack of funding.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuGSC4C6wYc|title=The Cryptic Corporation & Snakefinger Press Conference (1986)|access-date=June 20, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Following the Mole Show, the band was broke, and as such attempted to recoup some of their losses with several archival releases, including a collection of outtakes called ''[[Residue of the Residents|Residue]]'' in 1983, and a VHS containing recordings from the Mole Show as well as a newly-scored edit of ''Vileness Fats'' footage.

====The American Composers Series, 13th Anniversary Show, and the end of Ralph (1984–1987)====
Deciding to take a break from part three of the Mole Trilogy, the Residents began a new project entitled the ''American Composers Series,'' a planned series of 10 albums which would pay tribute to pop artists and instrumental composers from the United States. The first result of this pairing was ''[[George & James]]'', featuring the music of [[George Gershwin]] and [[James Brown]]. Following the release of ''George & James,'' the Residents finally abandoned part three of the Mole Trilogy, choosing instead to record a fourth entry entitled [[The Big Bubble: Part Four of the Mole Trilogy|''The Big Bubble'']], featuring very stripped-down instrumentation in order to portray a fictional garage rock band. No further entries into the Mole Trilogy have been recorded, and the project is considered abandoned.

When ''The Big Bubble'' was released in Japan by Wave Records'','' it was an unquestioned success, with its popularity resulting in Wave funding a two-week tour of Japan for the group in October 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Big Bubble - Historical - The Residents|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/index.php?page=bigbubble|access-date=2021-02-23|website=Residents.com}}</ref> The tour was successful, and re-ignited the group's interest in creating live performances. As a result, they eventually embarked on their 13th Anniversary world tour, ranging from 1985 to 1987, with Snakefinger playing electric guitar. As for studio work, the group eventually released their second entry into the American Composers series, ''[[Stars & Hank Forever: The American Composers Series|Stars & Hank Forever]]'', featuring the music of [[Hank Williams]] and [[John Philip Sousa]]. Their version of the Williams song "Kaw-liga" was particularly successful in the emerging club scene.

Due to licensing costs and the emerging CD format, the American Composers series was later abandoned. ''Stars & Hank Forever'' was the last Residents project Snakefinger would play on, as he later died of a heart attack in July 1987.

Following the release of the ''13th Anniversary Show'' LP in 1986 and a cover of "[[Hit the Road Jack]]" in 1987, the Cryptic Corporation resigned control of Ralph Records over to Tom & Sheenah Timony, and the Residents signed to [[Rykodisc]]. Tom and Sheenah would later turn Ralph into a new label, T.E.C. Tones, and establish the Residents' official fan club from 1988 to 1993 - UWEB (Uncle Willie's Eyeball Buddies).<ref name=":11">{{Cite book|last=Shirley|first=Ian|title=Never Known Questions: Five Decades of the Residents|publisher=[[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]]|year=2016|isbn=978-1909454262|location=UK}}</ref>

====''God in Three Persons'', ''Cube E,'' and (1987–1990)====
After two compilation CDs titled ''Heaven?'' and ''Hell!'', the Residents' first new project for Ryko was titled ''[[God in Three Persons (album)|God in Three Persons]],'' an hour-long poem in the form of a spoken-word rock opera. This was the first new Residents album to be released on [[Compact disc|CD]], and the last Residents project to be entirely recorded on analog tape, as the group moved on to [[MIDI]] technology; their first venture into MIDI would be scoring episodes for [[Pee-wee's Playhouse]] in 1987. Despite initially mixed critical and commercial reaction, ''God in Three Persons'' today is considered one of the group's masterworks.

On November 18, 1987, at a party in Amsterdam for Boudisque Records, the Residents' European label, they premiered a new work titled ''Buckaroo Blues,'' a suite of cowboy songs. After a choreographed [[Tele 5|TELE5]] appearance in April 1988, this suite would be coupled with a second one titled ''Black Barry'', a suite of "black music" (that is, blues and gospel), and form the first act of the Residents' next touring project, ''Cube-E: The History of American Music in 3EZ Pieces''. After the show's debut in New York, on July 21, 1989, it was decided to add a third act consisting of covers of [[Elvis Presley]] songs, completing the equation "Cowboy music + Black music = Rock and roll." The show took on a much more theatrical approach than the 13th Anniversary tour, with elaborate set designs, costumes, lighting and choreography. ''Cube-E'' toured from September 1989 to November 1990,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical: Cube E|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=cubee|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref> and was successful, both critically and financially.

A studio version of the third act was also released and titled ''[[The King & Eye]].'' The album was recorded at Different Fur Studios and released on [[Enigma Records]] around the time the tour began in September 1989. Further television work was also being done for [[MTV]], with the Residents scoring and doing voice work for ''[[Liquid Television]]'' and the [[Henry Selick]]-directed pilot "Slow Bob in the Lower Dimensions."

===1990–1997: Multimedia projects===
====''Freak Show,'' CD-ROMs, and the 25th anniversary (1991–1997)====
Recordings for a new studio album were worked on during breaks in the Cube-E tour, and shortly after the tour ended, ''[[Freak Show/Freak Show Soundtrack|Freak Show]]'' was released.<ref name=":10">''Freak Show'' pREServed edition liner notes.</ref> An album detailing the lives and personalities of fictional carnival freaks, the ''Freak Show'' project would spawn many other iterations, such as a graphic novel in collaboration with comic artists from [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], such as [[Brian Bolland]] and [[Matt Howarth]], and a promotional video created with the help of New York artist [[John Sanborn (media artist)|John Sanborn]], which also presented a music video for "Harry the Head", animated by computer artist Jim Ludtke - both artists would go on to collaborate with the Residents on many further projects.

A partnership with [[Voyager Company|Voyager]] in 1992 allowed the Residents to develop a [[LaserDisc|laserdisc]] titled ''[[Twenty Twisted Questions]]'' to celebrate their twentieth anniversary. Along with this laserdisc, a studio album was recorded, titled ''[[Our Finest Flowers]]''. Not quite a "greatest hits" compilation, many tracks on the album borrow elements from previous songs in the Residents' catalog.

The Residents' collaboration with Jim Ludtke would result in the creation of the ''Freak Show'' and ''[[Bad Day on the Midway]]'' [[CD-ROM]]s. Both of these projects featured many other collaborations with visual artists, including returning collaborators from the ''Freak Show'' graphic novel, such as [[Richard Sala]] and [[Dave McKean]]. The Residents enjoyed quite a bit of critical and financial success with these CD-ROMs, winning several industry awards. However, during early development stages for a third CD-ROM titled ''I Murdered Mommy'', their distributor [[Inscape (company)|Inscape]] was forced to dissolve due to oversaturation and obsoletion of the CD-ROM market.

Despite majorly occupying themselves with CD-ROM development, the Residents still remained musically active, releasing an [[enhanced CD]] album titled [[Gingerbread Man (album)|''Gingerbread Man'']] (an observation and study of nine fictional characters) in 1994, and scoring the [[Discovery Channel]] documentary series ''Hunters'' in 1995. ''Freak Show'' would also get a live adaptation in November 1995, at the Archa Theater in Prague. While the Residents did act as music and stage directors for the show, they did not actually perform - the music was conducted and performed by Czech band [[Už jsme doma|Už Jsme Doma]], while actors and dancers played their roles on stage.

''Freak Show Live'' would be the last iteration of the ''Freak Show'' brand; while a DVD was being developed in 2003, the early death of animator Jim Ludtke immediately brought the project to a halt.<ref name=":10" />

Around this time, singer/performer Molly Harvey was recruited to work with the group. While her first appearance in a Residents project was the ''Gingerbread Man'' album, she would officially become a member of the group in 1997, with a one-off performance at the [[Popkomm]] festival in Germany titled ''Disfigured Night''. This performance would later become the second act of a special 25th anniversary show at the [[Fillmore West|Fillmore]] in San Francisco, in October 1997.

=== 1998-2009: New collaborators / The 2nd millennium ===
==== Return to touring: ''Wormwood, Icky Flix,'' and ''Demons Dance Alone'' (1998–2005) ====
Due to the collapse of the CD-ROM market, a collective decision was made to tour again. While keeping up with their theatrical tendencies by regular use of costumes and stage props, the Residents would also perform and record with a team of guest musicians: the aforementioned Molly Harvey (vocals), Nolan Cook (guitar), Carla Fabrizio (arrangements and vocals), [[Toby Dammit]] (drums), and later on in 2002, [[Eric Drew Feldman]] (keyboards). Some of the band members, notably Feldman and Fabrizio, went on to collaborate with the group on numerous other projects up until the present time, while Cook eventually became a full-time band member. Fabrizio's connections with the Balinese gamelan ensemble [[Gamelan Sekar Jaya]] allowed for occasional collaborations between the two groups during this period.<ref name=":11" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical: Bridegroom of Blood|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=bridegroomofblood|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref>

The first tour with this new band formation was for the 1998 album [[Wormwood: Curious Stories from the Bible|''Wormwood'']], a collection of songs depicting typically gruesome stories from the [[Bible|Holy Bible]], mostly from the [[Old Testament]]. While the studio album only featured Harvey, Fabrizio and Dammit as guests (with Dammit only taking occasional vocal duties), the band would be mostly fully formed by the time of the show's live debut at the Fillmore in October 1998. The Wormwood show toured up to July 1999,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical: Wormwood Live|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=wormwoodlive|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref> and featured drastically different arrangements of songs from the album, mostly darker and heavier, as well as new or unused material related to the concept. Some of these arrangements would be recorded for a studio album titled ''[[Roadworms: The Berlin Sessions|Roadworms]],'' and a [[DVD]] of the live show would be released in 2005.

The same band formation would later tour to promote the Residents' first DVD, ''[[Icky Flix]]'' - a compilation of most of the group's music videos, as well as new animated videos and a re-recorded soundtrack, to celebrate the group's upcoming 30th anniversary. These re-recorded arrangements would be performed on the show as their corresponding videos would be played from the DVD on a screen.

On the event of the [[September 11 attacks]], the Residents were still touring ''Icky Flix'' in Europe. The resulting fear and anxiety caused by the attacks would eventually result in the recording of ''[[Demons Dance Alone]]'' in 2002. While not a direct response to the events, the songs on the album portrayed the negative emotions felt by the group and its individual members, and this was reflected in the album's subsequent tour, from October 2002 to September 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical: Demons Dance Alone|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=demonsdancealone|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref> The group's next major album, the 2005 ''[[Animal Lover]],'' contained lyrics of a similarly tragic nature, although in a more abstract manner. The album also contained a booklet with stories which presented the songs from the point of view of animals. ''Animal Lover'' was also the first Residents album to be released on the [[Mute Records|Mute]] label, which would be solely responsible for the Residents' major releases up until 2008.

''Animal Lover'' is currently the last Residents album to feature Molly Harvey, who moved to Atlanta to live with her husband at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ArtsATL: Molly Harvey interview, 2018|url=https://www.artsatl.org/qa-molly-harvey-talks-about-time-with-experimental-rockers-the-residents-and-remembers-hardy-fox/|url-status=live|website=Artsatl.org}}</ref> Her last appearance as a member of the Residents was at a small series of shows titled ''The Way We Were'' at the "What is Music?" festival in Australia. The show's setlist was a career retrospective much in the style of the 13th Anniversary tour - the last time the Residents had toured Australia.

===2005-2009: The "Storyteller" era===
====Narrative albums and ''The Bunny Boy'' (2006-2009)====
Due to the increasing numbers of [[Online piracy|illegal downloads]] of music on the Internet, which considerably decreased product sales, the Residents attempted a new artistic medium: the [[radio drama]], in the form of a paid [[podcast]] distributed through Apple's [[iTunes]] service. This podcast, titled ''The River of Crime'' (a first-person tale of an individual's obsession with crime and criminals) ran for five weekly episodes in 2006 before its cancellation due to inconveniences surrounding the podcast's promotion on iTunes, thereby disencouraging further production.<ref name=":11" />

Aside from ''Animal Lover'', the group's partnership with Mute produced three more albums: ''[[Tweedles]]'' in 2006 (a first-person character study of a sexually successful yet emotionally unavailable vampiric figure); ''[[The Voice of Midnight]]'' in 2007 (a retelling of the [[E. T. A. Hoffmann|E.T.A. Hoffmann]] story, ''[[The Sandman (short story)|Der Sandmann]]''); and ''[[The Bunny Boy]]'' in 2008 (a first-person narrative and character study of the titular Bunny in search of his missing brother).

While ''Tweedles'' and ''The Voice of Midnight'' have not yet been developed further (aside from instrumental releases such as [[The Ughs!|''The UGHS!'']] in 2009), ''The Bunny Boy'' proved a very accessible concept. A [[YouTube]] video series of the same name was done to promote and further elaborate on the project. The series was partially interactive; fans could communicate with Bunny via [[Email|e-mail]], and some of the interactions may or may not have altered the course of the series' plot (a book containing some of Bunny's correspondence was published by Bandits Mages in 2019).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ulule - The Bunny Boy Emails|url=https://br.ulule.com/the-bunny-boy-emails/|url-status=live|website=Br.ulule.com}}</ref> Soon afterwards the album was toured from October to December 2008. A second season of the video series was shown in 2009, somewhat officially ending the project.

===2010–2016: Randy, Chuck & Bob===
[[File:Residents 2013.jpg|thumb|The Residents in 2013 on their Wonder of Weird 40th Anniversary Tour]]
Making a decision to shift focus from studio work to touring, and to enhance their show's portability, the Residents would change their live band to a "power trio" formation, and in a sort of meta stunt, appear to "unmask" themselves as lead singer / frontman "Randy," composer / keyboardist "Charles 'Chuck' Bobuck," and guitarist Nolan Cook as "Bob" – although all three band members were still costumed: "Randy" donned an old man mask and wore an overcoat with oversized red tie and shoes; "Chuck" and "Bob" wore red jackets, special goggles and fake dreadlocks. There was also mention of a fourth band member, drummer "Carlos," who allegedly had left the music business to take care of his mother in Mexico; however, despite being credited as singer in the group's 2012 album ''Coochie Brake'', there is no further evidence of "Carlos" having ever been a real band member.

This new band formation debuted in the ''Talking Light'' tour, which ran from January 2010 to April 2011. While the setlist once again consisted of assorted songs from the band's repertoire (although with greatly reworked arrangements), the show would also feature newly written "ghost stories," in which a video of a narrator telling said stories would be projected onto the stage while the band performed in a somewhat improvisational manner. These "ghost stories" were loosely threaded by the presence of television, TV commercials, and industrialized products such as [[Oscar Mayer]] hot dogs or [[Betty Crocker]] Pudding Roll-ups – although these weren't endorsements; these products were simply a minor element integrated into the stories, not unlike [[product placement]]. In between certain songs, "Randy" would also speak to the audience, introducing the band and later describing his own history with supernatural appearances, and his subsequent fear of mirrors. The tour was financially successful, and the band would continue to perform in this formation with only minor changes in stage and costume design.

In the next couple of years, "Randy" would take on an increased role as frontman of the band, starting a "personal" [[Tumblr]] blog<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maurice and me - Tumblr|url=https://randyresident.tumblr.com/|url-status=live|website=Randyresident.tumblr.com}}</ref> where he would write mostly about life experiences and trivia regarding the Residents' history, as well as promoting his "solo" show, ''Sam's Enchanted Evening,'' which was presented in various incarnations between June 2010 and March 2012 with collaborators Joshua Raoul Brody and Carla Fabrizio. More akin to musical theater than a concert, the show focused on the titular Sam's life story, with the singer alternating between monologues and cover performances of various songs that were important in his life. During this period, the Residents would also collaborate with Belgian dancer/choreographer Grace Ellen Barkey from [[Needcompany]], composing the music for a show titled ''Mush-Room'' in 2013.

In 2014, "Randy" would maintain a series of vlogs with the help of director Don Hardy, titled ''In My Room'' and later ''Randyland,'' elaborating further on his experiences, both with the Residents and with events in his personal life. The blog currently has been inactive since January 6, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Maurice and me - Randy Returns|url=https://randyresident.tumblr.com/post/181762677130/hey-everybody-its-me-randy-remember-me|url-status=live|website=Randyresident.tumblr.com}}</ref> Composer "Charles Bobuck" would also maintain a series of personal writings on the Residents' website titled ''The Test Tube of Tomorrow,'' and occasionally release music under this name, usually material deemed unfitting for the Residents concept. Bobuck's writings were of a much more detailed and biographical nature, and his music much more abstract, often referred to as "contraptions" rather than compositions.

The group's 40th anniversary tour, ''The Wonder of Weird,'' also elaborated on the "Randy, Chuck & Bob" concept, although guised as an anthology show – lead singer Randy would once more speak to the audience between songs, briefly discussing the band's history as he slowly grew depressed with the state of the band and his own life, occasionally leaving the stage and prompting the remaining band members to improvise. The show toured from January to May 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical - Wonder of Weird|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=wonderofweird|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref>

This band formation toured once more in 2014 with a show called ''Shadowland'', retrofittingly subtitled "part three of the 'Randy, Chuck & Bob' trilogy." Initially a one-off week of performances in Europe, the show was eventually brought back in March 2015, coinciding with the premiere of the ''Theory of Obscurity'' film – a documentary on the history of the band, directed by Don Hardy and produced by Barton Bishoff and Josh Keppel <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/were-an-anonymous-band-how-do-you-make-a-film-about-the-residents-41119/|title=How Do You Make a Documentary About the Residents?|first=Christopher R.|last=Weingarten|website=Rollingstone.com|date=March 2, 2015|access-date=June 20, 2021}}</ref> – at the [[SXSW Film Festival]].<ref>[http://cimmfest.org/theory-obscurity-film-residents/ "Theory of Obscurity", ''Chicago International Movies and Music Festival''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509073343/http://cimmfest.org/theory-obscurity-film-residents/|date=May 9, 2014}}. Retrieved June 7, 2014</ref> This show would be the last time "Charles Bobuck" would perform with the band, as he decided to quit the touring business due to increasing health problems. He eventually quit the Residents altogether in 2016, revealing his identity as Hardy Fox of the Cryptic Corporation, and continued to make music as a solo artist until his death in October 2018.

''Shadowland'' then toured from August 2015 to July 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical - Shadowland|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=shadowland|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref> with Eric Drew Feldman (as Bobuck's cousin "Rico") replacing Fox on keyboards, as well as production on future Residents projects. The show was mostly similar to the previous two tours, with a setlist of various reworked songs from the group's repertoire, and occasional video interludes in the vein of ''Talking Light'', with different characters discussing their experiences with [[birth]], [[reincarnation]] and [[Near-death experience|near-death]].

=== 2017–present: "The Real Residents", ''Metal Meat & Bone'', and the ''pREServed'' series===
In March 2017, the Residents presented their new lineup, advertised as "The Real Residents": "Tyrone" on vocals, "Eekie" (Nolan Cook) on guitar, "Erkie" (Eric Feldman) on keyboards, and "Cha Cha" on drums and percussion. Shortly after a preview of their ''In Between Dreams'' tour in Japan, the group released their first studio album since ''Coochie Brake'', entitled ''The Ghost of Hope,'' describing real [[train wreck]] stories from the 19th and early 20th century. The album was released on [[Cherry Red Records]], the Residents' current label, and promoted with a single, and their first music video since 2001's ''Icky Flix'' – "Rushing Like a Banshee," directed by John Sanborn. Although The Ghost of Hope wasn't toured (except for a one-off performance at the San Francisco [[Exploratorium]]), the Residents played both sides of the "Rushing Like a Banshee" single on the ''In Between Dreams'' show, which ran from October 2017 up to February 2019 and followed a loose theme, much like ''Shadowland'', this time of dreams.

During the course of the tour, the Residents would work on new projects. Their next album, ''Intruders'', released in October 2018, was advertised along with the ''I am a Resident!'' concept, which started as a sort of officially-endorsed tribute project: fans would submit their interpretations of Residents songs, and the group would collect their favorites into an album. After the number of submissions vastly exceeded their expectations, the group decided to change the project into a type of collage, even recording segments and overdubs of their own. The final album was released to contributors in May 2018, and worldwide in August 2018.

In July 2018, the Residents also published their second [[novel]] (the first being a novelization of their game ''Bad Day on the Midway'' in 2012). The book, entitled ''The Brick-Eaters'', was described as "an absurdist buddy movie story featuring a very tall internet content screener teaming up with an aging career criminal whose primary companions are an oxygen bottle and a .44 Magnum".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mailchi.mp/cherryred/the-residents-july2018|title=The Residents publish a novel and announce details of Intruders – a brand album to follow I AM A RESIDENT! later this year|website=Mailchi.mp|access-date=October 31, 2018}}</ref>

The group also began their ongoing ''pREServed'' reissue series in January 2018 – deluxe editions of the major albums in the band's discography, containing brand new remasters and unreleased recordings from the band's archives, previously in care of Hardy Fox before he quit the group.

During the ''In Between Dreams'' tour, the Residents also previewed songs from their "upcoming [[blues]] album," which was eventually titled ''Metal, Meat & Bone''. The premise of the album was to present the long lost recordings of a fictional albino blues singer named Alvin Snow, also known as "Dyin' Dog." The Residents would present the original "Dyin' Dog demos" on one disc, and their own interpretations of the same songs on another disc. The album was released in July 2020 and promoted with two music videos for the Residents' new versions of "Bury My Bone" and "DIE! DIE! DIE!", the latter being sung by rock musician and [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] frontman [[Black Francis]].

''Metal, Meat & Bone'' will be further promoted by the Residents on their upcoming ''Dog Stab'' tour in August 2021 (following numerous cancellations and postponements on account of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]) – the show, currently marketed as "the 50th anniversary show," will allegedly present songs from the new album as well as new arrangements of songs from their 1978 album, ''[[Duck Stab/Buster & Glen|Duck Stab / Buster & Glen]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Residents' Historical - Dog Stab|url=https://www.residents.com/historical/?page=dogstab|url-status=live|website=Residents.com}}</ref>

To celebrate the groups' 50th anniversary, a retrospective coffee table book ''The Residents: A Sight for Sore Eyes, Vol. 1'' by author [[Aaron Tanner]] was announced. The book contains never before seen photos, quotes from celebrities influenced by the group, as well as a 7" single dating to the group's ''Not Available'' era.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Pearis|first=Bill|title=The Residents releasing 50th anniversary book 'A Sight for Sore Eyes'|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-residents-releasing-50th-anniversary-book-a-sight-for-sore-eyes/|access-date=2021-11-21|website=BrooklynVegan|language=en}}</ref>

==Identity==
In the group's early days, many rumors circulated about its membership. As the cover art of ''[[Meet the Residents]]'' was a parody of [[The Beatles]]' 1964 North American release, ''[[Meet the Beatles!]]'', rumors circulated that The Residents were actually The Beatles, even specifically naming [[George Harrison]]. Many other rumors have come and gone over the years, one being that '60s experimental band [[Cromagnon (band)|Cromagnon]] shared members with the band. [[Les Claypool]], frontman of rock band [[Primus (band)|Primus]], and [[Gerald Casale]] of new wave band [[Devo]] claimed to have been accused of being members of the band; and [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] is alleged to have played keyboards during the band's 13th-anniversary tour.

Since the late 1970s, much of the speculation about the members' identities has involved the group's management team, [[Cryptic Corporation|The Cryptic Corporation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06243-the-residents-interview |title="The Residents Do Not Live In The Past": A Profile & 'Interview' |first=Robert |last=Barry |date=May 11, 2011 |work=[[The Quietus]] |access-date=September 12, 2011}}</ref> It was formed in 1976 as a corporation in [[California]] by Jay Clem, Homer Flynn, Hardy W. Fox, and John Kennedy, all of whom denied having been band members. Clem and Kennedy left the Corporation in 1982, to the chagrin of fans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pssht.com/1982-the_year_the_residents_died.html |title=''1982: The Year the Residents Died'' August 2007, by Thompson, Philip L |website=Pssht.com |access-date=January 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729092623/http://pssht.com/1982-the_year_the_residents_died.html |archive-date=July 29, 2013}}</ref> The Residents members do not grant interviews, although Flynn, Fox, and Clem have conducted interviews on behalf of the group.

Nolan Cook, a prominent collaborator in the band's live and studio work (and a live member of [[I Am Spoonbender]]) denied in an interview that Fox and Flynn were The Residents. However, some consider Cook himself a member of the band, as he is known to wear the same head coverings as the group in live shows, and wore the trademark eyeball mask on the Wormwood Tour. He also played the part of "Bob" during the "Randy", "Chuck", and "Bob" trilogy of shows.

[[William Poundstone]], author of the [[Big Secrets]] books, compared voiceprints of a Flynn lecture with those of spoken word segments from the Residents discography in his book "Biggest Secrets". He concluded, "The similarities in the spectograms second the convincing subjective impression that the voices are identical", and that "it is possible that the creative core of the Residents is the duo of Flynn and Fox." A subset of that belief is that Flynn is the lyricist and that Fox writes the music. The online database of the performance rights organization [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]] (of which The Residents and their publishing company, Pale Pachyderm Publishing [<nowiki/>[[Warner-Chappell]]] have been members for their entire careers) lists Flynn and Fox as the composers of all original Residents songs, including pre-1974 songs from the "Residents Unincorporated" years.<ref name="bmi">[http://repertoire.bmi.com/writer.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&page=1&fromrow=1&torow=25&querytype=WriterID&cae=214955565&affiliation=BMI&keyid=117479&keyname=FOX%20HARDY%20WINFRED BMI.com online listing of songs written or co-written by Homer Flynn and Hardy Fox] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729134457/http://repertoire.bmi.com/writer.asp?blnWriter=True&blnPublisher=True&blnArtist=True&page=1&fromrow=1&torow=25&querytype=WriterID&cae=214955565&affiliation=BMI&keyid=117479&keyname=FOX%20HARDY%20WINFRED |date=July 29, 2013 }}, accessed May 24, 2005</ref>

[[Simon Reynolds]] wrote in his book ''[[Rip It Up and Start Again|Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984]]'' that "the Residents and their representatives were one and the same,"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Reynolds |first1=Simon |author-link1=Simon Reynolds |title=Rip It Up and Start Again: Post Punk 1978–1984 |type=Paperback |year=2006 |orig-year=2005 |publisher=Faber and Faber |page=250}}</ref> and elaborated further on one of his blogs, stating that "this was something that anybody who had any direct dealings with Ralph figured out sooner rather than later." [[Simon Reynolds|Reynolds]] quotes [[Helios Creed]], who identifies the Residents as a keyboardist named "H," a singer named "Homer," and "this other guy called John." Peter Principle of [[Tuxedomoon]] claimed that he and others "eventually figured out that the guy doing the graphics and the engineer in the studio were, in fact, the Residents."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ripitupfootnotes.blogspot.com/2008/11/footnotes-14-chapter-13-freak-scene-san.html |title=Footnotes No.&nbsp;14 |first=Simon |last=Reynolds |author-link=Simon Reynolds |date=November 22, 2008 |work=Rip It Up and Start Again: The Footnotes |access-date=September 9, 2011}}</ref>[[File:The Residents @ Middle East Downstairs (4423971968).jpg|thumb|Randy Rose at [[The Middle East (nightclub)|The Middle East]] (Cambridge, MA) in 2010]]Cryptic openly admits the group's artwork is done by Flynn (among others) under various names that, put together, become "Pornographics", but the pseudonym is rarely spelled the same way twice (examples: Porno Graphics, Pore No Graphix, Pore-Know Graphics); and that Fox is the sound engineer – meaning that he is the main producer, engineer, mixer, and editor of all their recordings. (Since 1976, all of The Residents' recordings have listed their producer as the Cryptic Corporation, presumably meaning Fox in particular.)

From 2010 to 2016, The Residents referred to themselves in concert as the characters "Randy", "Chuck", and "Bob", and referred to a former member of the band, "Carlos", who left the group following a disagreement with "Randy".<ref>The Residents - Talking Light: Bimbos - [[MVD Entertainment Group|MVD Visual]] (2011)</ref> There is speculation that "Carlos" is [[Carlos Cadona]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Better known by his stage name, "6025," Cadona was in the original lineup of the [[Dead Kennedys]] and appears on a live album by [[Snakefinger]].<ref name="Radford, 2015">{{cite news|last1=Radford|first1=Chad|title=Another side of Snakefinger|url=http://www.clatl.com/news/article/13082144/another-side-of-snakefinger|access-date=February 3, 2017|work=Creative Loafing Atlanta|date=March 11, 2015|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203175506/http://www.clatl.com/news/article/13082144/another-side-of-snakefinger|archive-date=February 3, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> "Carlos" may also refer to Carla Fabrizio, a touring member of The Residents from 1998<ref>The Residents Play Wormwood Credits, Ralph America, 2005</ref> to 2008.<ref>'My Window Live' 2008 Digital Single Credits, 2013</ref>

"Bob" is speculated to be guitarist and longtime collaborator Nolan Cook. Cook is often the only credited collaborator on the "Randy, Chuck, & Bob" era albums, such as ''[[Lonely Teenager]]'', ''Talking Light: Bimbo's'', and ''Shadowland''.

A synopsis for The Residents' 2012 stage production "Sam's Enchanted Evening" provides the name "Randy Rose" as that of The Residents' lead singer. "Chuck", or "Charles Bobuck", was the group's primary songwriter, and released a series of solo albums (or "contraptions") under this name during the "Randy, Chuck and Bob" era. The member known as Chuck retired from live performance due to ill health in 2015, and ultimately retired from The Residents altogether following the release of the ''Theory of Obscurity'' documentary film. [[Eric Drew Feldman]] replaced him and performed under the name "Rico" from 2015 to 2016.

In the liner notes featured on the 2020 reissue of Phillip Perkins' ''King Of The World'' album'','' Perkins confirms that he was a member of The Residents during their '''[[Assorted Secrets]]''<nowiki/>' lineup, which also performed  ''[[The Mole Show Live at the Roxy|The Mole Show]]''.<ref>Philip Perkins - King Of The World Liner Notes 'CHN001, chOOn!!, 2020

===Hardy Fox===
{{Main|Hardy Fox}}

In October 2017, former manager for The Residents, [[Hardy Fox]] identified himself as both the anonymous primary composer and producer for the Residents as well as the pseudonymous Charles Bobuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hardyfox.com/home/|title=Home – HARDY FOX|website=Hardyfox.com|access-date=July 13, 2018}}</ref>  Fox was born in [[Longview, Texas]], where his father worked in the oil industry; his mother was a nurse. The family moved several times, and Fox graduated from [[Rayville, Louisiana|Rayville High School]] in [[Louisiana]] in 1963.
