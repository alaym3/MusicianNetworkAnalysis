A '''jungle''' is [[land cover]]ed with dense [[tropical forest|forest]] and tangled vegetation, usually in [[tropical climate]]s. Application of the term has varied greatly during the past recent centuries.  Before the 1970s, [[tropical forest]]s were generally referred to as jungles, but this terminology has fallen out of usage.

==Etymology==
The word ''jungle'' originates from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''jaṅgala'', meaning rough and arid. It came into the English language via [[Bengali language|Bengali]] in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lexico.com/definition/jungle |title=Meaning of jungle in English |author=<!--Not stated-->  |date=2020 |website=Lexico |publisher=Oxford University Press/Dictionary.com |quote=Origin: Late 18th century via Hindi from Sanskrit jāṅgala ‘rough and arid (terrain)’. |access-date=11 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oed.com/;jsessionid=1C86B3477E4E4C6303A40486F5D7D16E?authRejection=true&url=%2Fview%2FEntry%2F102075%3Frskey%3DNNWPt8%26result%3D1|title=Home : Oxford English Dictionary|website=www.oed.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-01|url-access= subscription}}{{Subscription required}}</ref> 
''Jāṅgala'' has also been variously transcribed in English as ''jangal'', ''jangla'', ''jungal'', and ''juṅgala''.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020|reason=one of these spellings may be in the subscriber-only OED citation, which I cannot access}}
Although the Sanskrit word refers to dry land, it has been suggested that an Anglo-Indian interpretation led to its connotation as a dense "tangled thicket"<ref>{{cite book|title=The jungle and the aroma of meats: an ecological theme in Hindu medicine.

==Wildlife==
Because jungles occur on all inhabited landmasses and may incorporate numerous vegetation and land types in different [[climatic zone]]s, the [[wildlife]] of jungles cannot be straightforwardly defined.

==Varying usage==
===As dense and tangled vegetation===
[[File:Dry rainforest.jpg|thumb|left|Vine thicket, a typical tangled jungle, Australia]] 

One of the most common meanings of ''jungle'' is land overgrown with tangled vegetation at ground level, especially in the [[tropics]]. Typically such vegetation is sufficiently dense to hinder movement by humans, requiring that travellers cut their way through.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biomes/biomes_tropical_forests_page_1.html Tropical Forests<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010223155/http://www4.uwsp.edu/geo/faculty/ritter/geog101/textbook/biomes/biomes_tropical_forests_page_1.html |date=2012-10-10 }}</ref><ref>[http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/forest/introf.htm Mysterious Journey<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702005610/http://library.thinkquest.org/26634/forest/introf.htm |date=2012-07-02 }}</ref><ref name=autogenerated3>Nygren, A. 2006 Representations of Tropical Forests and Tropical Forest-Dwellers in Travel Accounts of ‘National Geographic', Environmental Values 15</ref>  This definition draws a distinction between [[rainforest]] and jungle, since the understorey of rainforests is typically open of vegetation due to a lack of sunlight, and hence relatively easy to traverse.<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web|url=http://www.oneonta.edu/faculty/baumanpr/geosat2/Central%20Africa%20I/Central%20Africa%20Part%20I.htm|title=Tropical Wet Realms Of Central Africa, Part I<!-- Bot generated title -->}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blueplanetbiomes.org/rainforest.htm|title=Rainforest Biomes|website=www.blueplanetbiomes.org}}</ref>  Jungles may exist within, or at the borders of, tropical forests in areas where the woodland has been opened through natural disturbance such as hurricanes, or through human activity such as logging.<ref name=autogenerated4 /><ref>Kricher JC. 1997.

===As moist forest===

Because European explorers initially travelled through tropical forests largely by river, the dense tangled vegetation lining the stream banks gave a misleading impression that such jungle conditions existed throughout the entire forest. As a result, it was wrongly assumed that the entire forest was impenetrable jungle.<ref>Sterling, T. (1983). ''The Amazon: The World's Wild Places''. Time-Life Books.

The terms "tropical forest" and "rainforest" have largely replaced "jungle" as the descriptor of humid tropical forests, a linguistic transition that has occurred since the 1970s. "Rainforest" itself did not appear in English dictionaries prior to the 1970s.<ref name=autogenerated1>Rogers, C. 2012 ''Jungle Fever: Exploring Madness and Medicine in Twentieth-Century Tropical Narratives''.

=== As metaphor ===
[[File:Jungle comics 128.jpg|thumb|upright|Use of the jungle to represent savageness and ferocity in popular culture.]]

As a metaphor, ''jungle'' often refers to situations that are unruly or lawless, or where the only law is perceived to be "survival of the fittest". This reflects the view of "city people" that forests are such places. [[Upton Sinclair]] gave the title ''[[The Jungle]]'' (1906) to his famous book about the life of workers at the Chicago Stockyards, portraying the workers as being mercilessly exploited with no legal or other lawful recourse.<ref>{{cite book|title=Dark Eden: the swamp in nineteenth-century American culture |series=Volume 43 of Cambridge studies in American literature and culture Structural Analysis in the Social Sciences|author=Miller, David Cameron |publisher= Cambridge University Press |year=1989| isbn=0-521-37553-3 }}</ref>

The term "[[The Law of the Jungle]]" is also used in a similar context, drawn from [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' (1894)—though in the society of jungle animals portrayed in that book and obviously meant as a metaphor for human society, that phrase referred to an intricate code of laws which Kipling describes in detail, and not at all to a lawless chaos.

The word "jungle" itself carries connotations of untamed and uncontrollable nature and isolation from civilisation, along with the emotions that evokes: threat, confusion, powerlessness, disorientation and immobilisation.<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref>Fearing, F. (1963) "The problem of metaphor" Southern Journal of Communication</ref><ref>Jones, J. (1962)  "The Thin Red Line". Dell Publishing New York</ref>  The change from "jungle" to "rainforest" as the preferred term for describing tropical forests as has been a response to an increasing perception of these forests as fragile and spiritual places, a viewpoint not in keeping with the darker connotations of "jungle".<ref name=autogenerated6 /><ref>Slater, C (2004).

[[Cultural studies|Cultural scholars]], especially [[post-colonial]] critics, often analyse the jungle within the concept of hierarchical domination and the demand western cultures often places on other cultures to conform to their standards of civilisation. For example: [[Edward Said]] notes that the [[Tarzan]] depicted by [[Johnny Weissmuller]] was a resident of the jungle representing the savage, untamed and wild, yet still a white master of it;<ref name = Said>{{cite book| chapter = Jungle Calling| title = Reflections on Exile: And Other Essays| series = Convergences Series| first = Edward W.| last = Said| publisher = Harvard University Press| year = 2000| isbn = 9780674003026| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/reflectionsonexi00said}}</ref> and in his essay "[[An Image of Africa]]" about ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' Nigerian novelist and theorist [[Chinua Achebe]] notes how the jungle and [[Africa]] become the source of temptation for white European characters like Marlowe and Kurtz.<ref name =Achebe>{{cite journal| first = Achebe| last = Chinua| title = An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' | journal = Massachusetts Review| edition = 18| year = 1977}}</ref>

Former [[Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Ehud Barak]] compared Israel to "a villa in the jungle", a comparison which had been often quoted in Israeli political debates. Barak's critics on the left side of Israeli politics strongly criticised the comparison. For example, [[Uri Avnery]] charged that comparing "civilised" Israel with "a villa" and Israel's Arab neighbors with the "wild beasts" of the "jungle" tends to throw the blame for the absence of peace on the "wild" Arab and Palestinian side, and absolve Israel of responsibility.<ref>Uri Avnery, "Barak: A Villa in the Jungle", Gush Shalom website, July 7, 2007 [http://zope.gush-shalom.org/home/en/channels/avnery/archives_barak/],</ref><ref>Akiva Eldar, "The price of a villa in the jungle", [[Ha'aretz]], Jan. 30, 2006 [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/the-price-of-a-villa-in-the-jungle-1.178800 ]</ref><ref>Larry Derfner, "Ehud Barak to step down: On his de-evolution, and Israel's", +972 Magazine, November 26, 2012 [http://972mag.com/ehud-baraks-de-evolution-and-israels/60889/]</ref>
