They're basically everything that I am.

==Career==
===2001–2003: Luke Records and TVT Records===
In 2001, Pitbull was signed to [[Luther Campbell]]'s [[Luke Records]] by Jullian Boothe, then the label's vice-president of A&R.<ref name="mtv.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1507698/labels-fighting-over-pitbulls-early-work.jhtml |title=Labels Fighting Over Music Pitbull Made When He Was A Puppy |publisher=mtv|date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=August 25, 2011}}</ref> In 2001, Pitbull was introduced to Robert Fernandez of Famous Artist Music & Management, an independent label and management company specializing in developing artists, by the [[Diaz Brothers]], a producer duo signed to the company. Fernandez "saw the eagerness and hunger he had" and, with the Luke Records deal ending, began working to develop Pitbull. Together they focused on creating a more radio-friendly sound. Fernandez later told [[HitQuarters]]: "At that time his music had a lot of verses and took a long time to get into the hook, and so we took time in getting the songs catchier and less on the rap side." {{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Fernandez introduced Pitbull to [[Lil Jon]], hoping to secure the rapper a small guest intro spot on Lil Jon's upcoming album ''Kings of Crunk.'' According to Fernandez, Jon took a liking to Pérez and offered him a track on the album; it is called "Pitbull's Cuban Ride Out." This track helped raise the young rapper's profile.<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/2011/August8_15_33_31.html |title=Interview with Robert Fernandez |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=August 9, 2011 |access-date=August 25, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926113513/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2F2011%2FAugust8_15_33_31.html |archive-date=September 26, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
