Shortly after Ishibashi debuted his full-length solo album ''151a'' on Indianapolis label [[Joyful Noise Recordings]], [[NPR]] [[All Songs Considered]] host [[Bob Boilen]] listed Kishi Bashi as his favorite new artist of 2012 noting that he created "a radiant, uplifting soundscape"  with songs such as "Bright Whites."<ref name=npr.org>{{cite web|last=Apple |first=Fiona |url=https://www.npr.org/2012/06/12/154596223/discussion-our-favorite-music-of-the-year-so-far |title=Discussion: Our Favorite Music Of The Year (So Far) : All Songs Considered |publisher=NPR |date=2012-06-12 |access-date=2014-07-18}}</ref> In the same year, [[Microsoft]] licensed "Bright Whites" for use in a commercial for [[Windows 8]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Krenn|first=Nick|title=Subliminal Stunner: Kishi Bashi – "Bright Whites" – (Windows 8 Commercial)|url=http://www.earbuddy.net/2012/12/kishi-bashi-windows-8-commercial.html|publisher=Earbuddy|access-date=4 January 2013}}</ref> Around the same time, [[Sony]] used Kishi Bashi's song "It All Began With A Burst" from the same album for a commercial introducing their Xperia Tablet S.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ilsley|first=Colin|title=Sony Commercial for Sony Xperia Tablet (2012)|url=http://www.popisms.com/TelevisionCommercial/62020/Sony-Commercial-for-Sony-Xperia-Tablet-2012.aspx|publisher=Rick (Popisms)|access-date=8 January 2013}}</ref> In addition to these placements, [[Smart (automobile)|Smart]] licensed "Chester's Burst Over The Hamptons" for their line of smart cars in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=2013 Smart Electric Car TV Spot, 'Parking Garage'|url=http://www.ispot.tv/ad/7LHN/2013-smart-electric-car-parking-garage|publisher=ispot|access-date=9 January 2013}}</ref>

Kishi Bashi has since been invited to play in major festivals such as [[SXSW]] and [[Austin City Limits]] and gone on an extensive US tour with supporting acts such as [[The Last Bison]] (from his native [[Hampton Roads]], Virginia). In early 2013, Kishi Bashi held a North American tour across the United States and Canada, continuing in EU and UK in spring 2013.
