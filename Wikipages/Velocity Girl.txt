'''Velocity Girl''' was an [[United States|American]] [[indie rock]] band formed in 1989 in [[College Park, Maryland|College Park]], [[Maryland]], United States, although it was generally known{{By whom|date=December 2019}} as a [[Washington, D.C.]]-area band. The band released three albums before splitting up in 1996.

== History ==
The band started as the duo of Kelly Riles and guitarist/singer Archie Moore (also of [[Black Tambourine]]) in 1989 (the two having met at university),<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=414}}</ref> initially going under the name The Gotterdemocrats. They became Velocity Girl with the addition of Brian Nelson (ex-Big Jesus Trashcan, also of Black Tambourine), Jim Spellman (ex-[[High Back Chairs]]), and lead singer Bridget Cross (soon to join [[Unrest (band)|Unrest]]).<ref name="Bonner">Bonner, Michael (1993) "Velocity Girl: Cop This", ''Lime Lizard'', May 1993, p. 74</ref> The band took its name from a [[Primal Scream]] B-side which appeared on the ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]'' compilation album.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Sarah Shannon joined to replace Cross after the release of the band's debut single "I Don't Care If You Go."<ref name="Bonner" /> Unlike some 1990s rock music that featured an abrasive vocal and instrumental style, Velocity Girl's sound, especially post-1993, was more melodic and typically featured "clean" (non-distorted) electric guitar sounds and two-part harmonies.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The band described their influences as "the Rough Trade and Postcard labels and some of the early Creation bands."<ref name="Bonner" />  However, on their first seven-inch records on [[Slumberland Records|Slumberland]] and Merge, as well as their first Sub Pop album, ''Copacetic'', Velocity Girl were noted for their [[shoegaze]] influences. The band was noted for its love of releasing a steady stream of 7" vinyl singles. Slumberland Records was formed in 1989 by members of several D.C.-area bands, including Velocity Girl. They often featured female/male vocals, sometimes simultaneously, with Archie Moore providing the male vocals.

Velocity Girl toured frequently, releasing three full-length recordings on the [[Sub Pop]] label. Music videos were released for "Crazy Town," (1993),"Audrey's Eyes," (directed by [[Phil Harder]]) (1993) "Sorry Again," (1994) "I Can't Stop Smiling," (directed by [[Spike Jonze]]) (1994) and "Nothing" (1996).  The group disbanded in late 1996 after playing their last show "The Buzz Bakesale" in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. Shannon, Riles and Spellman reunited in a short-lived project called Starry Eyes, releasing one EP in 1998.<ref name="Strong">Strong, Martin C. (2003) ''The Great Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-335-0}}, p. 1050</ref> Moore had already formed Heartworms before Velocity Girl split up, and later formed The Saturday People with Terry Banks of [[Tree Fort Angst]].<ref name="Strong" />

Sarah Shannon went on to release her self-titled album in 2002. There was one Velocity Girl reunion show played at the Black Cat in Washington, DC on June 9, 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metafilter.com/16930/|title=Comments on 16930|website=Metafilter.com|access-date=December 22, 2019}}</ref>
