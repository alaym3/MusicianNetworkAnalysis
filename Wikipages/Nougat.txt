'''Nougat''' ({{IPAc-en|US|pron|ˈ|n|uː|ɡ|ə|t}} {{respell|NOO|gət}}, {{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|n|uː|ɡ|ɑː}} {{respell|NOO|gah}};<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |work=OxfordDictionaries.com |url= http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/english/nougat |title=nougat |access-date=30 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=nougat |url= http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/nougat |work=Cambridge Dictionary Online |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |access-date=19 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=nougat |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nougat |work=Dictionary.com |access-date=19 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=nougat |url= http://www.thefreedictionary.com/nougat |work=TheFreeDictionary.com |access-date=19 August 2013}}</ref> {{IPA-fr|nuɡa|lang}}; {{lang-az|nuqa}}; {{lang-fa|نوقا}}) is a family of [[confections]] made with [[sugar]] or [[honey]], roasted [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] ([[almond]]s, [[walnut]]s, [[pistachio]]s, [[hazelnut]]s, and [[macadamia]] nuts are common), whipped [[egg white]]s, and sometimes chopped [[candied fruit]]. The consistency of nougat is chewy, and it is used in a variety of candy bars and chocolates. The word ''nougat'' comes from [[Occitan language|Occitan]] {{lang|oc|pan nogat}} ({{IPA-oc|ˈpaⁿ nuˈɣat|pron}}), seemingly from Latin {{lang|la|panis nucatus}} 'nut bread' (the late colloquial Latin adjective {{lang|la|nucatum}} means 'nutted' or 'nutty').

Two basic kinds of nougat exist. The first, and most common, is '''white nougat''' or '''Persian nougat''' ({{lang|fa|gaz}} in Iran; {{lang|es|turrón}} in Spain), made with beaten [[egg whites]] and honey; it appeared in the early 15th century, in [[Alicante]], [[Spain]] with the first published recipe in the 16th century,<ref>{{cite book |author=Anonymous |title=Manual de mujeres en el cual se contienen muchas y diversas recetas muy buenas |language=es |url= http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/01371074322363763092257/p0000001.htm#134 |date=2000 |orig-year=c. 1550 |editor-first=Jesús |editor-last=Majada Neila |publisher=Caligrama |isbn=9788493176341 |via=[[Biblioteca Virtual Miguel de Cervantes]] |access-date=2 November 2016}}</ref> and in [[Montélimar]], [[France]], in the 18th century ([[Nougat of Montélimar]]). The second is '''brown nougat''' ({{lang|fr|nougat noir}} in French, literally 'black nougat'; {{lang|it|croccante}} in Italian, meaning 'crunchy'), which is made without egg whites and has a firmer, often crunchy texture.

==History==
Many legends exist around nougat’s origins. Early recipes of white nougat, probably borrowed from Central Asia or Persia (Iran), were found in a Middle Eastern book in [[Baghdad]] the 10th century. That nougat was called {{lang|ar|ناطف}} ''{{transl|war|ALA|nāṭif}}''.<ref>Derived from the [[triliteral root]] ''{{transl|ar|ALA|nṭf}}'' 'to dribble, to trickle', literally denoting a white viscous mass, as in {{lang|ar|ناطف الحوت}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|nāṭif al-ḥūt}}'', '[[spermaceti]]'.

Mention of ''{{transl|ar|ALA|nāṭif}}'' was found in a triangle between Urfa, Aleppo, and Baghdad. At the end of the 10th century, the traveler and geographer [[Ibn Hawqal]] wrote that he ate some ''{{transl|ar|ALA|nāṭif}}'' in [[Manbij]] (in modern Syria) and [[Bukhara]] (in modern Uzbekistan).<ref>{{cite web |title=All kinds of nougat, A journey through the Mediterranean history of a confectionery |language=en |first=Marie Josèphe |last=Moncorgé |date=2018 |url=http://www.tambao-books.com/page-nougat_english |publisher=TAMBAO |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref>

==Distribution and popularity==
In southern Europe, nougat is a prominent component of [[Christmas meal]]s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theculturetrip.com/europe/spain/articles/a-brief-history-of-spanish-turron/|title=A Brief History Of Spanish Turrón|last=Jessop|first=Tara|work=Culture Trip|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>

''{{lang|es|[[Turrón]]}}'' is produced in [[Spain]]; ''nougat'' in southern [[France]]; ''{{lang|it|[[torrone]]}}'', ''{{lang|it|[[mandorlato]]}}'', ''{{lang|it|cupeta}}'', and ''cubbaita'' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|cupedia}}'') in [[Cremona]], [[Taurianova]], and [[Sicily]] in [[Italy]];<ref>{{Cite web |title=Torrone di Benevento |language=it |url=http://www.sito.regione.campania.it/AGRICOLTURA/tipici/tradizionali/torrone-benevento.htm |work=sito.regione.campania.it |access-date=12 February 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233309/http://www.sito.regione.campania.it/AGRICOLTURA/tipici/tradizionali/torrone-benevento.htm |archive-date=3 March 2016 }}</ref> ''{{transl|el|mandolato}}'' or ''{{transl|el|mandola}} in [[Greece]]; and ''{{lang|mt|qubbajd}}'' in [[Malta]] (where it is sold in village festivals). In [[Romania]], it is known as ''{{lang|ro|alviță}}'' and is sold in local festivals and fairgrounds, mainly on the Sunday of Forgiveness preceding the [[Lent|Easter Lent]]); in a local variant form, it is made in [[Tabriz]], [[Iran]], where it is known as ''Luka''. 

The nougat that appears in many [[candy bar]]s in the United States and United Kingdom differs from traditional recipes and consists of [[sucrose]] and [[corn syrup]] aerated with a whipping agent (such as [[egg white]], [[Hydrolization|hydrolyzed]] [[soybean|soya]] protein or [[gelatine]]); it may also include [[vegetable fat]]s and [[milk powder]]. Typically, it is combined with nuts, caramel, or chocolate. Some American confections feature this type of nougat as the primary component, rather than combined with other elements. Varieties of nougat are found in [[Milky Way (chocolate bar)|Milky Way]], [[Reese's Fast Break]], [[Snickers]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onegreenplanet.org/vegan-food/15-of-your-favorite-famous-halloween-treats-made-vegan/|title=15 of Your Favorite Famous Halloween Treats, Made Vegan! {{!}} One Green Planet|website=www.onegreenplanet.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-27}}</ref> [[Double Decker (chocolate bar)|Double Decker]], [[ZERO bar]]s, and [[Baby Ruth]] bars.

In Britain, nougat is traditionally made in the style of the southern European varieties, and is commonly found at [[fair]]grounds and [[seaside resort]]s. The most common industrially produced type<ref>{{Cite web |title=Barrat Nougat Bar Sweets product reviews and price comparison |url=http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/food/barrat-nougat-bar/ |work=DooYoo.co.uk |access-date=12 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121223123835/http://www.dooyoo.co.uk/food/barrat-nougat-bar/ |archive-date=23 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> is coloured pink and white, the pink often fruit flavoured, and sometimes wrapped in edible rice paper with almonds and [[cherry|cherries]].

When nougat spread to [[Taiwan]], preparers there began to add milk powder as the main raw material, plus sugar, cream, protein (some companies use whey protein refined from fresh milk instead of protein and protein powder), nuts (such as peanuts, almonds, walnuts, pistachios or hazelnuts), dried fruit and petals (such as [[cranberry]], golden [[pomelo]], [[mango]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], [[longan]], and [[osmanthus]]). These secondary raw materials have become unique features of Taiwanese nougat. 

Compared to table-top nougat, French European nougat does not have any milk or milk powder ingredients. It is made by adding sugar or honey to egg whites and sprinkling in almonds or nuts. In addition, some manufacturers use edible rice paper to prevent the nougat from being deformed, but the amount used affects the taste, so preferences vary from person to person.

==Variations==

[[File:Nougat stange aus jeibmann 150dpi.jpg|thumb|Viennese nougat, a German-style variety with finely ground hazelnuts produced since 1920]]
Spanish nougat known as ''{{lang|es|turrón}}'' follows the traditional recipes with toasted nuts (commonly [[almond]]s), sugar, honey, and egg whites.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/nougat|title=nougat {{!}} confection|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-10-25|language=en}}</ref>

''{{lang|it|Torrone}}'' from Italy includes these same basic ingredients as well as vanilla or citrus flavoring, and is often sandwiched between two very thin sheets of rice paper.<ref name="BestofSicily">{{cite web |url= http://www.bestofsicily.com/mag/art161.htm |title=Sicilian Torrone |last=Gangi |first=Roberta |work=Best of Sicily Magazine |date=2005 |access-date=7 May 2008}}</ref> The [[Veneto|Venetian]] town of [[Cologna Veneta]] is well known for its nougat production, especially the type called ''{{lang|it|[[mandorlato]]}}''<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Facaros|first1=Dana|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46503931|title=Northeast Italy.|last2=Pauls|first2=Michael|date=2001|publisher=Cadogan|isbn=1-86011-808-9|edition=2nd|location=London|page=106, 260|oclc=46503931}}</ref> (''{{lang|it|mandorle}}'' in [[Italian (language)|Italian]]); this type is also based on honey, sugar, egg whites, and almonds but has a different flavor and is harder to bite than ''{{lang|it|torrone}}''.

"Wiener (Viennese) Nougat" {{dubious|reason= No source for the name|date=December 2019}} is a variant that contains only sugar, cocoa butter, nuts, and cocoa mass and has a mellow consistency. The nuts used for Viennese nougat are usually [[hazelnuts]]. In Germany and the Nordic countries, Viennese nougat is traditionally and labelled as nougat,<ref>Odense: [http://www.odense-marcipan.dk/odense-produkter/nougat.aspx Nougat - ingredients] {{in lang|da}}</ref><ref>Odense: [http://www.odense-marcipan.dk/den-soede-skole/bloed-nougat.aspx Blød Nougat] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230213122/http://www.odense-marcipan.dk/den-soede-skole/bloed-nougat.aspx |date=2014-12-30 }} Pictures and description. {{in lang|da}}</ref> while in [[Sweden]] and [[Denmark]], the original nougat is referred to as "French nougat".<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.marabou.se/produkter/fransk-nougat?p=6318&r=3240/ |title=Fransk Nougat |language=sv |work=Marabou.se|publisher=Marabou |date=17 December 2010 |access-date=31 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nemlig.com/produkt/kiosk/chokolade/chokoladebarer/fransk-nougat-marabou-46-g.aspx |title=Fransk Nougat |language=da |work=nemlig.com |author=Marabou|access-date=31 August 2014}}</ref> In Germany, [[Gianduja (chocolate)|gianduja]] is traditionally called nougat.
