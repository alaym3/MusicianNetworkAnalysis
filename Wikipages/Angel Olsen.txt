==Early life and education==
Angel Olsen was born on January 22, 1987 in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. At age three, Olsen was adopted by a foster family that had cared for her since shortly after her birth. The difference in years between her and her parents left an impression. "Because there are so many decades of difference between us, I became more interested in what their childhood was like," she says of her parents, both of whom still live in St. Louis. "I fantasized about what it was like to be young in the ’30s and ’50s, more so than other kids my age."<ref name="spin.com" /> Olsen explained that "my mother just has this capacity for children."<ref name="spin.com" />

Despite early adolescent aspirations to be a "pop star", her interests later shifted in high school. Olsen became more introverted, regularly attending [[punk rock]] and [[noise music]] shows at the [[Lemp Neighborhood Arts Center]] and the Creepy Crawl as well as [[Christian rock]] shows throughout the city.<ref name="Appelstein">{{Cite web |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/musicblog/2014/04/23/angel-among-us-an-oral-history-of-angel-olsens-time-in-st-louis?showFullText=true |title=Angel Among Us: An Oral History of Angel Olsen's Time In St. Louis |last=Appelstein |first=Mike |access-date=2016-09-01}}</ref> She began learning the piano and guitar and writing her own music.<ref name="spin.com" /><ref name="guardian14">{{cite news |last=Lamont |first=Tom |date=2014-03-30 |title=Angel Olsen: 'I had to learn someone else's songs.
