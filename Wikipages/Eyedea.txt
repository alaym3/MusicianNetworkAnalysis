'''Micheal David Larsen'''<ref name="citypages"/><!-- His MySpace Twitter & official .com state his name was "Micheal", not "Michael" --> (November 9, 1981 &ndash; October 16, 2010), better known by his stage name '''Eyedea''', was an American musician, [[rapper]] and poet. He was a [[battle rap|freestyle battle]] champion and [[songwriter]] from [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bloginity.com/2010/10/eyedea-dead-at-28-michael-larsen-indie-singer-of-rhymesayer|title=Eyedea Dead at 28; Michael Larsen, Indie Singer of Rhymesayer|publisher=Bloginity.com|date=2010-10-17|access-date=2015-04-02}}</ref>

Larsen had appeared as a solo artist under the pseudonym Oliver Hart, and as the [[MC]] half of the duo [[Eyedea & Abilities]] (along with longtime friend and collaborator [[DJ Abilities]]).<ref name=CP>{{cite web|first=Peter S.|last=Scholtes|url=http://www.citypages.com/2001-09-12/music/what-s-the-big-eyedea|title=What's the Big Eyedea?|publisher=City Pages|date=2001-09-12|access-date=2008-07-20|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101023061304/http://www.citypages.com/2001-09-12/music/what-s-the-big-eyedea/|archive-date=2010-10-23}}</ref> He was first signed under [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]]'s independent hip-hop label [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] before founding his own record label ''Crushkill Recordings''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.micheallarsen.com/tag/crushkill-recordings/|title=Crushkill Recordings {{!}} The official site of Micheal "Eyedea" Larsen|website=www.micheallarsen.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>

==Career==
Eyedea first stepped into the hip-hop scene battling against other emcees at notable freestyle competitions. Notable wins included a victory at [[Scribble Jam]] (1999) and the televised [[Blaze Battle]] sponsored by [[HBO]] (2000), which was hosted by [[KRS-One]].<ref>{{Citation|title=BLAZE BATTLE|date=2004-07-13|url=https://www.amazon.com/BLAZE-BATTLE/dp/B0001XAKMY|publisher=Media|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> Following the win, he won an impressive portion of money, but was also offered a higher cut if he signed a [[Recording contract|record contract]] with hip hop mogul [[Sean Combs|P. Diddy]], to which he declined, instead helping build [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] from the ground up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2004/2/20/eyedea-rebuilds-underground-hip-hop-from-the/|title=Eyedea Rebuilds Underground Hip-hop from the Beat Up {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref>

Notable hip-hop outlets have labeled Eyedea as a freestyle pioneer. Eyedea has released numerous albums alongside DJ Abilities where the two performed under the duo name "Eyedea & Abilities". In 2001, Eyedea & Abilities released their debut studio album ''[[First Born (Eyedea & Abilities album)|First Born]]'', which included their successful single "Big Shots".

The single was later chosen to appear on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4. In 2004, Eyedea & Abilities released their second studio album titled ''[[E&A]]'', which included the singles "[[E&A|Paradise]]" & "[[E&A|Man vs Ape]]". In July 2009, Eyedea & Abilities released their third and final studio album called ''[[By the Throat (Eyedea & Abilities album)|By the Throat]]'', which was followed by highly acclaimed positive ratings. In 2014, Eyedea ranked #2 on Abbey Magazine's Top 25 'greatest freestyle emcees of all-time'.

==Early life==
Eyedea grew up near [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] with his mother Kathy Averill, who gave birth to him when she was seventeen years old. He is of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/eyedeaandabilities/posts/10152476225076994 |date=2014-12-10 |via=Facebook.com |first=Kathy |last=Averill |type=Interview transcript |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6VhWabKQD?url=https://m.facebook.com/eyedeaandabilities/posts/10152476225076994 |archive-date=2015-01-19 |url-status=live |title=I'm half Lebanese, and mostly Irish otherwise |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=2015-04-02 }}</ref> He attended [[Highland Park High School (Minnesota)|Highland Park Senior High School]].<ref name=CP/>

Eyedea became known as a battle MC, touring the circuit between 1997 and 2001. During this time, he won top prizes at Scribble Jam '99, the Rock Steady Anniversary 2000, and Blaze Battle New York 2000. These battles included him beating notable artists such as [[Immortal Technique]], [[Freestyle Fellowship|P.E.A.C.E]] and [[PackFM]]. In 1999, he made his first national appearance on the [[Anticon]] compilation, ''[[Music for the Advancement of Hip Hop]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.anticon.com/item/anticon-presents-music-advancement-hip-hop|title=Anticon Presents: Music For The Advancement Of Hip Hop {{!}} Anticon|website=www.anticon.com|access-date=2017-02-15}}</ref> He also toured extensively as second MC and support [[DJ]] for [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]].

In 2001, he released ''[[First Born (Eyedea & Abilities album)|First Born]]'' with his partner [[DJ Abilities]] (collectively, they were initially called the Sixth Sense, but later changed the name to [[Eyedea & Abilities]]). In 2002, under his pen name "Oliver Hart", he released the self-produced ''[[The Many Faces of Oliver Hart|The Many Faces of Oliver Hart, or: How Eye One the Write Too Think]]''. In 2004, he reunited with Abilities to release the self-titled album ''[[E&A]]''.

All of Eyedea's releases have been on the [[Rhymesayers Entertainment|Rhymesayers]] record label, with the exception of the Carbon Carousel EP, which was released on his own [[Independent music]] label, Crushkill Recordings. In addition to touring independently and with Rhymesayers labelmates and members of [[Face Candy]], Eyedea & Abilities participated in the [[Def Jux]]-sponsored "Who Killed the Robots?" tour, titled by Eyedea.

==Music career==
He was signed to [[Rhymesayers Entertainment]] and collaborated with [[Slug (rapper)|Slug]] of the [[underground hip hop]] group [[Atmosphere (music group)|Atmosphere]] as well as [[Sage Francis]], [[Aesop Rock]], and [[Blueprint (rapper)|Blueprint]]. He was also a member of the hip hop collective and super group "The Orphanage" along with Slug, [[Aesop Rock]], [[Blueprint (rapper)|Blueprint]], [[Sage Francis]] & [[Illogic]]. Although never releasing a full CD to the public, songs were recorded and released.<ref name=CP1>{{cite web|url=http://www.factmag.com/2010/10/18/r-i-p-legendary-battle-rapper-and--fav-eyedea|title=Legendary battle rapper Eyedea dies|publisher=FactMag|date=2010-10-17|access-date=2010-10-17}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

After Eyedea released ''This Is Where We Were'', recorded with his live [[freestyle rap]]/jazz group [[Face Candy]], he created Carbon Carousel, an alternative rock band. They have released one EP, entitled ''The Some of All Things, or: The Healing Power of Scab Picking''. This brought on speculation that Eyedea & Abilities were no longer together. However, in August 2007, the duo announced on their Myspace that they would be at the Twin Cities Celebration of Hip-Hop performing old songs and new material. In December 2007, Eyedea & Abilities embarked upon their Appetite for Distraction Tour with Crushkill labelmate [[Kristoff Krane]] and Minnesotan duo Sector7G.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 2007, Eyedea created a book of poetry and art with painter Louis N. LaPierre, who is also responsible for Face Candy's 'This Is Where We Were' album art. The book was titled ''Once A Queen... Always A Creep''. Only 80 copies were made.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.louisnlapierre.com/portfolio/once-a-queen-always-a-creep/|title=…once a queen, always a creep. « Louis N LaPierre|last=onioneye|website=www.louisnlapierre.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref>

The summer of 2009 saw Eyedea & Abilities joining the touring hip hop festival [[Rock the Bells]] for a limited number of dates, performing alongside such acts as [[Sage Francis]], [[Evidence (artist)|Evidence]], [[M.O.P.]] and [[the Knux]]. E&A also performed at the first Rock the Bells concert in 2004, infamous for being [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]'s last performance with the [[Wu-Tang Clan]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

In 2011, an EP of 4 of Eyedea's freestyles, previously released in 2010 but only sold at live shows, were made available for 'pay what you want' download.<ref name="freestyles">{{cite web|url=http://micheallarsen.bandcamp.com/album/freestyles|title=Eyedea Freestyles EP|access-date=2011-04-14|publisher=Micheallarsen.bandcamp.com|year=2011}}</ref> Guitar Party a group consisting of vocalist (and first grader) Mijah Ylvisaker, drummer J.T.

== Style and influences ==
Eyedea is widely known and praised for his battle rap skills. ''[[LA Weekly]]'' listed his 1999 [[Scribble Jam]] battle with P.E.A.C.E from [[Freestyle Fellowship]] as one of the greatest rap battles of all time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theumdstatesman.com/blog/2014/10/16/whos-big-eyedea|title=Who's the big Eyedea?|newspaper=The Statesman|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US}}</ref> Despite the aggressive nature of MC battling, his music is often described as thoughtful and philosophical, yet it still provides a live aesthetic.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.388/title.eyedea-abilities-ea#|title=Eyedea & Abilities - E&A|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX -|newspaper=HipHopDX|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.strangefamousrecords.com/blogs/sage-francis/the-man-behind-the-eyedea/|title="The Man Behind the Eyedea" - Strange Famous Records|date=2010-10-23|newspaper=Strange Famous Records|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-US}}</ref>
