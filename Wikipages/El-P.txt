==Early life==
El-P was born Jaime Meline in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]] on March 2, 1975, the son of Nan Dillon<ref name="Chamberlin" /> and jazz pianist Harry Keyes (born Harry Meline).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abacus.bates.edu/pubs/mag/96-Fall/keyes.html|title=Harry Keyes '54|publisher=Abacus.bates.edu|access-date=December 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224145204/http://abacus.bates.edu/pubs/mag/96-Fall/keyes.html|archive-date=December 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He is of Cajun, Irish, and Lithuanian descent.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/18/arts/music/18herm.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | title=Indie Rapper Reseizes the Brooklyn Moment | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 18, 2007 | access-date=September 19, 2015 | author=Hermes, Will | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129233650/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/18/arts/music/18herm.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0 | archive-date=January 29, 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="Chamberlin">[http://danielchamberlin.com/?page_id=178 URB Magazine 2002 via DanielChamberlin.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208120814/http://danielchamberlin.com/?page_id=178 |date=December 8, 2015 }} Accessed December 2015.</ref> While his mother was raised [[Catholic]] and his father was raised [[Jewish]], they did not emphasize either faith to him, and he later joked that he "got none of it except a [[Brit milah|circumcision at birth]]".<ref name="Chamberlin" />

El-P's parents divorced when he was seven years old, and he later wrote the song "Last Good Sleep" about once hearing his mother being assaulted by his drunken stepfather in the next room and not realizing what had happened until the next day.<ref name="Chamberlin" /> Although his mother responded to the beating by splitting up with his stepfather, reporting him to police, and changing their home's locks, El-P had recurring nightmares about the incident and once chased a stranger he mistook for his ex-stepfather through the [[New York City Subway|New York subway]].<ref name="Chamberlin" />

El-P was expelled from two high schools for various issues, including his refusal to stop wearing his baseball cap backwards,<ref name="Chamberlin" /> but still got his [[GED]].<ref name="Chamberlin" /> He later went to musical engineering school at the Center for the Media Arts in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8tRwzOjy40|title=Nardwuar vs. EL-P|date=February 14, 2014|website=Youtube|access-date=June 9, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228161830/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8tRwzOjy40|archive-date=February 28, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> After graduating, he enrolled at [[Hunter College]], but dropped out because most of his courses did not relate to the career he wanted.<ref name="Chamberlin" />

==Career==
===Early career===
{{BLP sources section|date=June 2017}}
Getting involved with the [[hip hop culture]] of New York City at an early age, El-P met [[Mr. Len]] when he hired Len as the DJ for his 17th birthday party. The two quickly became friends and formed [[Company Flow]] in 1992. They released their first [[Gramophone record|vinyl]] single, "Juvenile Technique", in 1994. [[Bigg Jus]] later joined the group and in 1996 the trio released its debut EP, ''[[Funcrusher EP|Funcrusher]]''. Subject to a major-label bidding war after the success of the EP, Company Flow waited until it could get a contract on its own terms. The group eventually signed with [[Rawkus Records]], and released its debut full-length album, ''[[Funcrusher Plus]]'' (1997).

After an [[instrumental hip hop|instrumental]] album titled ''[[Little Johnny From the Hospitul: Breaks & Instrumentals Vol.1]]'' (1999), also on [[Rawkus]], disagreements between El-P and the label led to Company Flow leaving Rawkus. El-P then decided to start his own [[record label]], [[Definitive Jux]] (known informally as Def Jux, and extra-formally as Definitive Juxtapositions), and because of critically acclaimed albums such as [[Cannibal Ox]]'s ''[[The Cold Vein]]'' (produced by El-P) and [[Aesop Rock]]'s ''[[Labor Days]]'', the label quickly rose to prominence.

Company Flow dissolved amicably in 2001 and the following year El-P released his debut [[solo album]] ''[[Fantastic Damage]]'', to wide critical acclaim. In 2004, El-P collaborated with the Blue Series Continuum for a [[jazz-fusion]] album titled ''[[High Water (El-P album)|High Water]]'', which received favorable reviews from both the hip hop and jazz worlds, as well as from more mainstream critics independent of both scenes. 2005 saw the release of ''[[Collecting the Kid]]'', an odds-and-ends assortment including work from ''High Water'' and ''Bomb the System'', in addition to several songs of unknown provenance. El-P's second proper studio album, ''[[I'll Sleep When You're Dead]]'', was released on March 20, 2007. It generally received very favorable reviews and became El-P's most commercially successful album as a solo artist to date, peaking at No. 78 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In an interview about ''I'll Sleep When You're Dead'', he identifies himself as an atheist.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Diver|first1=Mike|title=El-P: "When I run out of magic pills, I'll lose my sh*t"|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1896260-el-p--when-i-run-out-of-my-magic-pills-i%E2%80%99ll-lose-my-sh-t|website=Drowned In Sound|access-date=July 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331000824/http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/1896260-el-p--when-i-run-out-of-my-magic-pills-i%E2%80%99ll-lose-my-sh-t|archive-date=March 31, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

In October 2009, El-P announced that he was working on his third studio album, titled ''[[Cancer 4 Cure]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cancer4cure.blogspot.com/|title=im going to stab you.|author=el producto|publisher=Cancer4cure.blogspot.com|access-date=December 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113072444/http://cancer4cure.blogspot.com/|archive-date=January 13, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> El-P also was a part of a group called Central Services, which consisted of El-P, [[Camu Tao]], and Allysin Baker. In the fall of 2010, the EP ''Forever Frozen in Television Time'', was released exclusively on the Def Jux digital download service. In August 2011, it was announced that El-P signed with Fat Possum Records, which would release ''Cancer 4 Cure''. Later that month, El-P released a single off the upcoming album, via the [[Adult Swim]] Singles program, titled "Drones Over BKLYN". On February 22, 2012, El-P announced on his Facebook page that ''Cancer 4 Cure'' was officially complete. The album was later released to music retailers on May 22.

===Run the Jewels===
{{main|Run the Jewels}}
[[Run the Jewels]], a current collaboration of El-P with [[Atlanta]]-based rapper [[Killer Mike]], was formed in 2013. The two rappers were introduced to each other by [[Adult Swim]] executive Jason DeMarco in 2011.<ref name=RollingStone_RTJ>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/run-the-jewels-how-2014s-hardest-rap-duo-came-back-from-oblivion-20141024 |title=Run the Jewels: 2014's Brashest Rap Duo Comes Back From Oblivion |newspaper=Rolling Stone |date=October 24, 2014 |author=Christopher R.

===Film scoring===
El-P was the principal composer for the 2005 film ''[[Bomb the System]]''; he was one of the candidates to score a trailer for 2017's ''[[Blade Runner 2049]]'', but his score was "rejected or ignored".<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/blade-runner-2049-score-trailer-soundtrack-el-p-run-the-jewels-hans-zimmer-a7965371.html |title=Listen to El-P's 'rejected' Blade Runner 2049 score |date=September 25, 2017 |work=The Independent|access-date=October 7, 2017|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007220511/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/blade-runner-2049-score-trailer-soundtrack-el-p-run-the-jewels-hans-zimmer-a7965371.html |archive-date=October 7, 2017|last = Hooton|first = Christopher}}</ref> He created the score for the 2020 biopic ''[[Capone (2020 film)|Capone]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.nme.com/news/el-p-shares-score-tom-hardy-movie-capone-2678768 | title = El-P shares soundtrack for Tom Hardy movie 'Capone' | last = Daly | first = Rhian | date = May 29, 2020 | website = New Musical Express (NME) | access-date = February 22, 2021}}</ref>

==Style==
El-P's rapping style is characterized by dense, aggressive, and verbose attacks which include heavy use of metaphors, sci-fi fantasy themes, pop culture references, and [[Association (psychology)|associative]] wordplay. His lyrics often feature themes found in the works of sci-fi author [[Philip K. Dick]], such as paranoia and questions about the nature of reality.<ref name=PF_LP_PKD>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/5866-el-p/ |title=El-P |website=Pitchfork.com |date=August 1, 2002 |author=Chennault, Sam |access-date=December 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161229170844/http://pitchfork.com/features/interview/5866-el-p/ |archive-date=December 29, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> Reviewing his 2002 album ''[[Fantastic Damage]]'', critic Steve Huey described El-P as "one of the most technically gifted MCs of his time, spitting out near-impossible phrases and rhythmic variations that simply leave the listener's head spinning".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/fantastic-damage-mw0000219593 |title=Fantastic Damage â€“ El-P |website=Allmusic |author=Steve Huey |access-date=May 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502212648/http://www.allmusic.com/album/fantastic-damage-mw0000219593 |archive-date=May 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

El-P's 2004 album ''[[High Water (El-P album)|High Water]]'' was a radical departure, pitting his beats and production against a jazz band under the direction of pianist [[Matthew Shipp]], a fan of El-P's music. In a 2003 interview with Shipp for ''[[Bomb (magazine)|Bomb]]'' magazine, El-P stated, "First and foremost, I wanted to [make a different album] because it scared the shit out of me. And when I get offered the chance to be involved with something that scares me, I usually do it, because I'm trying to learn, I'm trying to understand music as much as I can, to become a better musician in general and work in different capacities."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/el-p/|title=El-P by Matthew Shipp â€“ Bomb Magazine|website=bombmagazine.org|access-date=October 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180921031825/https://bombmagazine.org/articles/el-p/|archive-date=September 21, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>
