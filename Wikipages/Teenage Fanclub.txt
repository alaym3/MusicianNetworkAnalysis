'''Teenage Fanclub''' are a Scottish [[alternative rock]] band formed in [[Bellshill]] near Glasgow in 1989.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The group were founded by [[Norman Blake (Scottish musician)|Norman Blake]] (vocals, guitar), [[Raymond McGinley]] (vocals, lead guitar) and  [[Gerard Love]] (vocals, bass), all of whom shared lead vocals and songwriting duties until Love's departure in 2018. As of 2019, the band's lineup consists of Blake, McGinley, [[Francis Macdonald]] (drums, vocals), Dave McGowan (bass, vocals) and [[Euros Childs]] (keyboards, vocals).<ref name=TFC>{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/166226133538510/posts/1237592516401861/|title=It's 2019...|author=Teenage Fanclub|publisher=Facebook|date=16 January 2019|access-date=16 January 2019}}</ref>

In concert, the band usually alternate among its songwriters, giving equal playing time to each one's songs. Although often pegged as alternative rock, the group have incorporated a wide variety of elements from various [[Music genre|music styles]] in their songs.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Teenage Fanclub have had a succession of drummers, namely Francis Macdonald, [[Brendan O'Hare]] and Paul Quinn. Keyboardist Finlay Macdonald (no relation) has also been a member. As of April 2021, the band have released eleven studio albums and two [[compilation album]]s.

==History==
Teenage Fanclub emerged from the Glasgow [[C86 (music)|C86]] scene. They formed in Bellshill in 1989 following the break-up of The Boy Hairdressers, a band featuring Raymond McGinley, Norman Blake, and Francis Macdonald.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Teenage Fanclub {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/teenage-fanclub-mn0000015694/biography|access-date=2020-11-26|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref>  Following a brief period in which Blake was a member of [[BMX Bandits (band)|BMX Bandits]], the three former bandmates joined with Gerard Love to form Teenage Fanclub.<ref name=":0" /> 

Originally a noisy and chaotic band, their first album ''[[A Catholic Education]]'', released in 1990 on [[Paperhouse (record label)|Paperhouse]], is largely atypical of their later sound, with the possible exception of ''Everything Flows''. Mostly written by Blake and McGinley, the record included several songs originally intended for The Boy Hairdressers.<ref name=":0" /> After recording his drum parts, Macdonald left the band to resume his university studies. They re-recorded several songs with Macdonald's replacement,
[[Brendan O'Hare]], because they weren't satisfied with the results of the original recording sessions,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/bnmw3v/rank-your-records-teenage-fanclub-norman-blake|title=Rank Your Records: Norman Blake Merrily Rates the Ten Teenage Fanclub Albums|first=Cam|last=Lindsay|publisher=Vice|date=1 September 2016|access-date=27 January 2021}}</ref> and because they wanted to involve O'Hare in the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uncut.co.uk/features/teenage-fanclub-finest-albums-writing-songs-wasnt-difficult-everyone-106883/|title=Teenage Fanclub on their finest albums: "If writing songs wasn't difficult, everyone would be doing it!"|first=Tom|last=Pinnock|publisher=Uncut|date=14 August 2018|access-date=27 January 2021}}</ref>

The band followed the album with the EP ''God Knows It's True'' before being signed by [[Creation Records]].  ''[[The King (album)|The King]]'', their next album, was a semi-improvised collection recorded in a single day.<ref name=":0" /> Originally intended to be a very limited release,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Rank Your Records: Norman Blake Merrily Rates the Ten Teenage Fanclub Albums|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/bnmw3v/rank-your-records-teenage-fanclub-norman-blake|access-date=2020-11-26|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref> the record received critical reviews of its self-confessed shambolic guitar thrashes and a cover of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography" />

Their next album, ''[[Bandwagonesque]]'', released on [[Creation Records]] in the UK and [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] in the US, brought Teenage Fanclub a measure of commercial success. ''Bandwagonesque'' was more deliberately constructed, the hooks became stronger, the guitar riffs were brought under control, and the harmony vocals took shape.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  ''Bandwagonesque'' topped ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine's 1991 end-of-year poll for best album,<ref>{{cite web |title=Teenage Fanclub – Bandwagonesque |url=http://www.acclaimedmusic.net/album/A817.htm |work=[[Acclaimed Music]] |access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> beating [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', their Creation stablemates [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]'s album ''[[Loveless (My Bloody Valentine album)|Loveless]]'', and [[R.E.M.]]'s ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]''.

The subsequent, ''[[Thirteen (Teenage Fanclub album)|Thirteen]]'', received mixed reviews on release.  Brendan O'Hare left Teenage Fanclub during this period because of "musical differences", to be replaced by Paul Quinn (formerly of the [[Soup Dragons]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

''[[Grand Prix (album)|Grand Prix]]'', Teenage Fanclub's fifth album, was both a critical and commercial success in the UK, becoming their first top ten album.  In the [[United States]] however the band failed to regain the ground that ''Thirteen'' had lost them.  Around this time [[Liam Gallagher]] of labelmates [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] called the band "the second best band in the world" — second only to Oasis.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/norman-blake-does-rocknroll-kill-braincells |title=Norman Blake – Does Rock 'n' Roll Kill Braincells?|work=[[NME]]|date=1 January 2011 |access-date=5 November 2015}}</ref>

''[[Songs from Northern Britain]]'' followed ''Grand Prix'' and built on the former's success.  It became their highest charting release in the UK and contained their biggest hit single to date, "Ain't That Enough".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The follow-up album, ''[[Howdy! (Teenage Fanclub album)|Howdy!]]'', released on [[Columbia Records]] in the UK after the demise of Creation, continued the sound of ''Songs from Northern Britain''. Francis Macdonald rejoined as the drummer in place of Quinn, who left the band after recording his parts for ''Howdy!'' and before its release in order to focus on his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/teenage-fanclub-31-1395974|title=Fanny Quits Club|publisher=NME|date=28 March 2000|access-date=20 January 2019}}</ref> Quinn went on to form [[The Primary 5]].

In 2002, they released ''[[Words of Wisdom and Hope]]'' with [[Jad Fair]] of [[Half Japanese]].

Their final release on a [[Sony]] label, ''[[Four Thousand Seven Hundred and Sixty-Six Seconds – A Short Cut to Teenage Fanclub]]'', collected the Fanclub's best songs along with three new songs (one from each member).

Their next album, ''[[Man-Made]]'', was released on 2 May 2005, on the band's own ''PeMa'' label. ''Man-Made'' was recorded in Chicago in 2004, and produced by [[John McEntire]] of [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]].

In 2006, the band held two special concerts (in London and Glasgow) playing their 1991 album ''[[Bandwagonesque]]'' in its entirety.

The band began work on their ninth album in August 2008, booking an initial three weeks at Leeders Farm recording studio in Norfolk.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teenagefanclub.com |title=Teenage Fanclub official website. "Work Starts on a New Album!" |publisher=Teenagefanclub.com |access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref> The album was called ''Shadows'', the first to involve keyboardist Dave McGowan as a full-time member, and was released on the band's own ''PeMa'' label. It became available in Europe, Australasia and Japan on 31 May 2010, and was released by [[Merge Records]] in North America on 8 June 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teenagefanclub.com//?p=393 |title=Posting on Teenage Fanclub website |publisher=Teenagefanclub.com |access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref>

In May 2015, Teenage Fanclub played support for the [[Foo Fighters]] at their [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground]] gig.

Their tenth album, ''[[Here (Teenage Fanclub album)|Here]]'', was released on 9 September 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/teenagefanclub.music/photos/a.166513806843076.1073741828.166226133538510/645764495584669/?type=3 |title=Teenage Fanclub – Timeline |via=[[Facebook]] |access-date=9 September 2016}}</ref>

The story of Teenage Fanclub's early days features in the 2017 documentary ''[[Teenage Superstars]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/teenage-superstars|title=British Council Film: Teenage Superstars|last=Film|first=British Council|website=film.britishcouncil.org|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref>

In August 2018 the band issued new versions of their five [[Creation Records]] era albums which had been remastered at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. To celebrate the reissues, the band also announced Songs from Teenage Fanclub: The Creation Records Years, a four-city UK tour during late October to mid-November in which they would play three nights each in Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and London, with each night's setlist covering different periods of the Creation-era discography,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/teenage-fanclub-confirm-vinyl-re-issues|title= Teenage Fanclub Confirm Vinyl Re-Issues|first=Robin|last=Murray|publisher=Clash|date=25 April 2018|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref> and featuring former drummers Brendan O'Hare and Paul Quinn participating, in which both drummers would respectively perform the albums and B-sides they had originally recorded.<ref>{{cite web|last=Virtue|first=Graeme|date=1 November 2018|title=Teenage Fanclub review – classic lineup bids farewell with glorious nostalgia trip|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/nov/01/teenage-fanclub-review-barrowland-ballroom-glasgow|access-date=19 January 2019|work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="glove" /> These gigs would be Gerard Love's last with the group,<ref name="glove">{{cite web |title=Teenage Fanclub Part Ways With Gerard Love {{!}} Pitchfork |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/teenage-fanclub-part-ways-with-gerard-love/ |website=pitchfork.com |access-date=20 August 2018 |language=en}}</ref> as he separated from the band due to differences in opinion on their future touring plans, later revealed to be a reluctance to fly frequently around the world for live performances.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10156701873042990&id=520867989|title=I thought I should say a few words about the Teenage Fanclub situation.|first=Gerard|last=Love|via=Facebook|date=21 August 2018|access-date=22 August 2018}}</ref>
