'''Rajaton''' is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[a cappella]] ensemble, founded in [[Helsinki]] in 1997. The [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word ''rajaton'' means "boundless", to indicate the breadth of their repertoire, from sacred classical to near [[Europop]].
Rajaton performs primarily in Finland but also tours around Europe and the rest of the world, having performed in over 25 countries.

In 2005, Rajaton album sales reached 100,000 worldwide. They have earned eight [[List of music recording sales certifications|gold records]] in total, with ''Rajaton Sings ABBA'' reaching platinum (30,000) and ''Joulu'' reaching double platinum (60,000).

Rajaton mainly performs a cappella, music written or arranged by members of the ensemble. Most lyrics are taken from poetry and from a collection of Finnish folk poetry ''[[Kanteletar]]''.
