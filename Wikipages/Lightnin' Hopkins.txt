'''Samuel John''' "'''Lightnin''''" '''Hopkins''' (March 15, 1912 – January 30, 1982)<ref name="bare">{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues: A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger | location= Santa Barbara, California| pages=294 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}</ref> was an American [[country blues]] singer, songwriter, guitarist and occasional pianist from [[Centerville, Texas]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him No. 71 on its list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/lightnin-hopkins-19691231 |title=Lightnin' Hopkins &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists |magazine=Rollingstone.com |access-date=2010-08-09}}</ref>

The [[musicologist]] [[Robert "Mack" McCormick]] opined that Hopkins is "the embodiment of the jazz-and-poetry spirit, representing its ancient form in the single creator whose words and music are one act".<ref name="russell">{{cite book

==Life==
Hopkins was born in [[Centerville, Texas]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Woke Up This Mornin': Poetry of the Blues |last=Nicholas |first=A. X. |year=1973 |publisher=[[Bantam Books]] |page=87 }}</ref> As a child, he was immersed in the sounds of the [[blues]]. He developed a deep appreciation for the music at the age of 8, when he met [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] at a church picnic in [[Buffalo, Texas]].<ref name="amg">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p87808|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic biography]</ref> He went on to learn from his distant older cousin, the country blues singer [[Alger "Texas" Alexander]];<ref name="amg"/> Hopkins had another cousin, the Texas electric blues guitarist [[Frankie Lee Sims]], with whom he later recorded.<ref name=Dahl>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=frankie-lee-sims-p125539/biography|pure_url=yes}} | title = Frankie Lee Sims: Biography | publisher = [[AllMusic]].com | last = Dahl | first = Bill | access-date = 2010-10-19}}</ref>) Hopkins began accompanying Jefferson on guitar at informal church gatherings. Jefferson reputedly never let anyone play with him except Hopkins, and Hopkins learned much from Jefferson at these gatherings.

In the mid-1930s, Hopkins was sent to Houston County Prison Farm; the offense for which he was imprisoned is unknown.<ref name="amg"/> In the late 1930s, he moved to Houston with Alexander in an unsuccessful attempt to break into the music scene there. By the early 1940s, he was back in Centerville, working as a farm hand.

Hopkins took a second shot at Houston in 1946. While singing on Dowling Street in Houston's [[Third Ward, Houston|Third Ward]], which would become his home base, he was discovered by Lola Anne Cullum of [[Aladdin Records (US)|Aladdin Records]], based in [[Los Angeles]].<ref name="amg"/> She convinced Hopkins to travel to Los Angeles, where he accompanied the pianist Wilson Smith. The duo recorded twelve tracks in their first sessions in 1946. An Aladdin executive decided the pair needed more dynamism in their names and dubbed Hopkins "Lightnin'" and Wilson "Thunder".<ref name="LarkinBlues">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Blues]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-673-1|pages=181/3}}</ref>

[[File:Hopkins-Goldstar-Promo.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gold Star promotional photograph, 1948]]
Hopkins recorded more sides for Aladdin in 1947. He returned to Houston and began recording for [[Gold Star Records]]. In the late 1940s and 1950s he rarely performed outside Texas, only occasionally traveling to the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and the [[Eastern United States|East]] for recording sessions and concert appearances. It has been estimated that he recorded between eight hundred and a thousand songs in his career.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}} He performed regularly at nightclubs in and around Houston, particularly on Dowling Street, where he had been discovered by Aladdin. He recorded the [[hit record]]s "T-Model Blues" and "Tim Moore's Farm" at [[SugarHill Recording Studios]] in Houston. By the mid- to late 1950s, his prodigious output of high-quality recordings had gained him a following among [[African American]]s and blues aficionados.<ref name="LarkinBlues"/>

In 1959, the blues researcher [[Robert "Mack" McCormick]] contacted Hopkins, hoping to bring him to the attention of a broader musical audience engaged in the [[Roots revival|folk revival]].<ref name="amg"/> McCormack presented Hopkins to integrated audiences first in Houston and then in [[California]]. He made his debut at [[Carnegie Hall]] on October 14, 1960, alongside [[Joan Baez]] and [[Pete Seeger]], performing the spiritual "[[Mary Don't You Weep]]". In 1960, he signed with [[Tradition Records]]. The recordings which followed included his song "[[Mojo Hand]]" in 1960.

In 1968, Hopkins recorded the album ''Free Form Patterns'', backed by the rhythm section of the [[psychedelic rock]] band [[13th Floor Elevators]]. Through the 1960s and into the 1970s, he released one or sometimes two albums a year and toured, playing at major [[folk music]] festivals and at folk clubs and on college campuses in the U.S. and internationally. He toured extensively in the United States<ref name="russell"/> and played a six-city tour of Japan in 1978.

Hopkins was Houston's poet-in-residence for 35 years. He recorded more albums than any other blues musician.<ref name="russell"/> A statue of Hopkins sits in [[Crockett, Texas]].<ref>Russell, pp. 145–146.</ref>

Hopkins died of [[esophageal cancer]] in Houston on January 30, 1982, at the age of 69. His obituary in the ''[[New York Times]]'' described him as "one of the great country blues singers and perhaps the greatest single influence on rock guitar players."<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/01/obituaries/sam-lightnin-hopkins-69-blues-singer-and-guitarist.html| title = Obituary: Sam (Lightnin') Hopkins, 69; Blues Singer and Guitarist| author = Saxon, Wolfgang| date = February 1, 1982| access-date = November 11, 2012| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

His Gibson J-160e "hollowbox" is on display at the Rock Hall of Fame in Cleveland, and his Guild Starfire at the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, DC, both on loan from the Joe Kessler collection.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

==Musical style==
Hopkins's style was born from spending many hours playing informally without a backing band. His distinctive [[fingerstyle]] technique often included playing, in effect, [[Bass guitar|bass]], [[Rhythm guitar|rhythm]], [[Lead guitar|lead]], and [[percussion]] at the same time.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} He played both "alternating" and "monotonic" bass styles incorporating imaginative, often chromatic [[Turnaround (music)|turnarounds]] and single-note lead lines. Tapping or slapping the body of his guitar added rhythmic accompaniment.

Much of Hopkins's music follows the standard [[Twelve bar blues|12-bar blues]] template, but his phrasing was free and loose. Many of his songs were in the [[talking blues]] style, but he was a powerful and confident singer.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} Lyrically, his songs expressed the problems of life in the segregated South, bad luck in love and other subjects common in the blues idiom. He dealt with these subjects with humor and good nature. He often referred to himself as "Poor Lightnin'" in his songs when talking about himself or referring to himself as the protagonist of the song. This is also the name of one of his albums. Many of his songs are filled with [[double entendre]]s, and he was known for his humorous introductions to songs.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Some of his songs were of warning and sour prediction, such as "Fast Life Woman":

{{blockquote|<poem>You may see a fast life woman sittin' round a whiskey joint,
Yes, you know, she'll be sittin' there smilin',
'Cause she knows some man gonna buy her half a pint,
Take it easy, fast life woman, 'cause you ain't gon' live always...<ref name="russell"/></poem>}}
