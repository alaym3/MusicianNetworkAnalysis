==History==
Mild Orange originates from [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. The band was originally formed by early childhood friends Josh Mehrtens and Josh Reid who met in kindergarten and by chance met again in university,<ref name="Mild Orange - Live at Radioactive.fm">{{cite web |title=Mild Orange - Live at Radioactive.fm |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t27y6_ciM3g&t=74s |website=Youtube |accessdate=22 May 2020}}</ref> and later joined by Tom Kelk and Jack Ferguson.<ref name="MuzicNetNZ" /> They were quickly catapulted into the music scene after securing a spot on a Corona Extra New Zealand tour and a New Year's eve set at Rhythm and Vines festival in 2017.

According to the band, the name Mild Orange was chosen because 'The colour orange can cause one to experience a heightened sense of optimism, a boost in aspiration, and a stimulation of warmth and happiness'.<ref name="MuzicNetNZ">{{cite web |last1=Monaghan |first1=Kerry |title=Mild Orange - Album Review: Foreplay |url=http://www.muzic.net.nz/articles/reviews/86732/mild-orange-album-review-foreplay |website=Muzic Net NZ |accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref>

During 2018 they sold out their album release tour of New Zealand with stops in [[Wellington]], [[Auckland]], [[Christchurch]] and two shows in their hometown of [[Dunedin]]. During the tour, they had a wide range of supporting artists including [[Jack Berry]], [[DJ Snakelegs]], [[Same Name Confusion]], [[The Halps]], [[The Butlers]], [[Old Boy (band)|Old Boy]] and [[Hoochie World]].<ref name="msccomission">{{cite web |title=Mild Orange Release Debut Album 'Foreplay |url=https://www.nzmusic.org.nz/news/artist/mild-orange-release-debut-album-foreplay/ |website=New Zealand Music Commission |accessdate=28 July 2018}}</ref>

All four members hold degrees from the University of Otago. Josh Mehrtens - Bachelor of Laws and Bachelor of Arts, Josh Reid - Masters in Sustainable Business, Tom Kelk Bachelor of Applied Science, Jack Ferguson - Bachelor of Arts.

==Foreplay==
The songs on "Foreplay" had their early beginnings in 2016 when Mehrtens and Reid found themselves living together in a ten-person flat in [[Dunedin]] and spending many nights together writing music.<ref name="msccomission"/> Mehrtens then spent another six months recording the vocals and mixing in [[Arrowtown]] and [[Dunedin]]. Mehrtens had little previous experience recording or mixing and admitted that there were times he doubted his own experience and abilities.<ref name="hello"/>

Their debut album, Foreplay was released on April 28, 2018.<ref name="bandcamp"/> Foreplay was both independently produced and published, and it was released mainly in digital media. It was critically acclaimed for its "introspective nature", and "soothing guitar melodies":<ref name="hello"/>
{{Quote box
 |quote  = Foreplay is a thoroughly introspective album. It’s an honest exploration of love and loss. By the time I’d arrived home and had finished Foreplay, I had felt a lot. The album’s honest exploration of emotion, inspires it. You can’t ask for much more from any album.

With the exception of Stranger, which was recorded at the [[Chicks Hotel]] recording studio, the whole album was recorded in the band's own house. The lead singer, Josh Mehrtens, also doubled as producer and mixer. The fact that the record was not anchored to any recording label, according to Mild Orange, gave them a unique creative freedom: “We were keen as to record it ourselves so that we weren’t under any time pressures that you may encounter in a studio when you’re paying for time. We bought a bunch of pro-spec gear to at least try and get good quality but a lot of that comes down to the process."<ref name="hello"/>

Despite the lack of a recording studio, critics acclaimed the clean sound of the album: "While many DIY recorded/mixed albums carry a DIY roughness with it, there is no such grittiness on Foreplay. Each track is meticulously crafted, every detail scrutinized. Mehrt(sic) is evidently a bit of a sonic wizard and his leap of faith has undoubtedly paid off."<ref name="hello"/>

The record's style was described as "psychedelic" and full of "optimistic but introspective guitar-driven tunes",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/14182/Dunedins-Mild-Orange-Drop-Debut-Album-Foreplay.utr |website=Under the Radar NZ |title= Dunedin's Mild Orange Drop Debut Album 'Foreplay'}}</ref> and "an experimental, mellow and decidedly ambient sound. It's very relaxing and uplifting. A sound that is most definitely unconventional and has an Indie soft rock vibe."<ref name="MuzicNetNZ"/>
