== Early life ==

Michael Whitaker Smith was born to Paul and Barbara Smith in [[Kenova, West Virginia]]. His father was an oil refinery worker at the Ashland Oil Refinery, in nearby [[Catlettsburg, Kentucky]]. His mother was a caterer.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p2400/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Michael W. Smith: Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=August 15, 2009 |author=Sandra Brennan}}</ref> He inherited his love of baseball from his father, who had played in the [[minor league baseball|minor leagues]]. As a child, he developed a love of music through his church. He learned piano at an early age and sang in his church choir. At the age of 10, he had "an intense spiritual experience" that led to his becoming a devout [[Christians|Christian]]. "I wore this big cross around my neck," he would recall, "It was very real to me."<ref name="long">{{cite journal|last=Long|first=Jim|title=Michael W. Smith Looks Back|journal=Christianity Today|date=March 1988|volume=46|issue=8|page=56}}</ref> He became involved in Bible study and found a group of older friends who shared his faith.<ref name="long" />

After his older Christian friends moved away to college, Smith began to struggle with feelings of loneliness and alienation. After graduating from high school, he gravitated toward alcohol and drugs.<ref name="Allmusic"/> He attended [[Marshall University]] while developing his songwriting skills but dropped out after one semester. He also played with various local bands around [[Huntington, West Virginia]]. During that time, his friend [[Shane Keister]], who worked as a session musician in Nashville, encouraged him to move to Nashville, the Country Music capital, and pursue a career in music.<ref name="long" />

In 1978, Smith moved to Nashville, taking a job as a landscaper to support himself. He played with several local bands in the Nashville club scene. He also developed a problem with substance abuse.

{{quote|I really started losing touch when I moved to Nashville, around April of '78. I was smokin' marijuana, drinking, doing some other drugs; just being crazy, you know. My mom and dad knew what I was doing. But they never hassled me; they just prayed for me. And I felt convicted by God. Every time I'd wake up I knew: This isn't me. But I couldn't change myself.<ref name="long" />}}

In November 1979, Smith suffered a breakdown that led to his recommitment to Christianity. The next day he auditioned for a new contemporary Christian music (CCM) group, Higher Ground, as a keyboardist and got the job. His lead vocals were heard on much of CCM radio with the single, "I Am". It was on his first tour with Higher Ground, playing mostly in churches, that Smith was finally able to put the drugs and alcohol behind him.<ref name="long" />

== Music career ==

=== Beginning (1981–1989) ===
In 1981, while he was playing keyboards for Higher Ground,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Michael W.|title=It's Time To Be Bold|date=2003|publisher=Thomas Nelson}}</ref> Smith was signed as a writer to Meadowgreen Music, where he wrote numerous [[gospel music|gospel]] hits penned for artists such as [[Sandi Patty]], [[Kathy Troccoli]], [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] and [[Amy Grant]], to the effect that some of these popular worship songs can now be found in church [[hymnals]]. The following year, Smith began touring as a keyboardist for Grant on her ''[[Age to Age]]'' tour.

He became Grant's opening act and recorded his first [[Grammy]]-nominated solo album ''[[The Michael W. Smith Project]]'' (which he also produced himself) in 1983 on the [[Reunion Records]] label. This album contained the first recording of his hit "Friends", which he co-wrote with his wife Deborah. By the time Smith's second album ''[[Michael W. Smith 2]]'' was released in 1984, he was headlining his own tours. In 1986, Smith released ''[[The Big Picture (Michael W. Smith album)|The Big Picture]]''.

After the release of his 1988 effort, ''[[i 2 (EYE)]]'', Smith once again collaborated with Grant for her "Lead Me On" world tour. The following year, Smith recorded his first [[Christmas]] album, simply titled ''[[Christmas (Michael W. Smith album)|Christmas]]'' (1989).

=== Mainstream venture and inspirational pop albums (1990–1999) ===

[[File:Graham Crusade Smith.JPG|thumb|Michael W. Smith and [[Toby Mac]] with evangelist [[Billy Graham]] in 1994]]
In 1990, Smith released ''[[Go West Young Man (Michael W. Smith album)|Go West Young Man]]'', his first mainstream effort, which included the mainstream [[crossover (music)|crossover]] hit single "[[Place in This World]]". The song peaked at No. 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 1992, he released ''[[Change Your World (Michael W. Smith album)|Change Your World]]'', which included the No. 1 adult contemporary hit "[[I Will Be Here for You]]". In 1993 Smith released his first box set, ''[[The Wonder Years (Michael W. Smith box set)|The Wonder Years]]'' and his first greatest hits album, ''[[The First Decade (1983–1993)]]''. The latter also includes two new songs, "Do You Dream of Me?" and "Kentucky Rose".

In 1994, Smith appeared as a guest pianist on the album ''[[Swing, Swang, Swung]]'' by [[Christian rock]] band [[Guardian (band)|Guardian]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes |title=[[Swing, Swang, Swung]] |others=[[Guardian (band)|Guardian]] |year=1994 |type=Liner notes |publisher=Myrrh |id=7012529261 |location=Los Angeles}}</ref>

In 1995, Smith released his eighth album ''[[I'll Lead You Home]]'', which combines the pop style of his secular albums with a touch of religious feel. ''[[Live the Life]]'' (1998) and ''[[This Is Your Time (Michael W. Smith album)|This Is Your Time]]'' (1999) follow the same style. In 1998, Smith also released his second Christmas album, ''[[Christmastime (Michael W. Smith album)|Christmastime]]''.

Smith collaborated with [[Jim Brickman]] on "Love of My Life", a romantic love song for Brickman's album ''Destiny'' in 1999. The song went to chart at No. 9 on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks]]. Also in 1999, he became the first Christian artist to receive the [[ASCAP]] "Golden Note" Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting.<ref name=goldennote /><ref>{{cite news|title=Greater Cincinnati – Northern Kentucky Mission|url=http://www2.cincinnati.com/billygraham/guests.html|newspaper=Cincinnati.com|access-date=May 21, 2015|quote=He is also the first Christian artist to receive the ASCAP "Golden Note" Award for lifetime achievement in songwriting}}</ref>

=== Instrumental and live worship albums (2000–2003) ===

Nearly all of Smith's albums include at least one instrumental track, and in 2000, Smith recorded his first all instrumental album, ''[[Freedom (Michael W. Smith album)|Freedom]]''. The following year, Smith released his first all-worship music album, ''[[Worship (Michael W. Smith album)|Worship]]'', on September 11. This album was followed by a sequel, ''[[Worship Again]]'' in 2002. Both albums were recorded live in concert. ''Worship Again'' also includes a song that Smith wrote called "There She Stands", inspired by the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. He performed this song live for the 2004 [[Republican National Convention]],<ref name="ccm1 ">{{cite journal| last=Croteau | first=Roberta | title =Ready for His Close-up |journal=[[CCM Magazine]]| date=December 2004|url =http://www.ccmmagazine.com/search/11535181/ |access-date= August 15, 2009}}</ref> saying that President [[George W. Bush]], who he said is a fan and a family friend, had asked him to write a song about the attacks.<ref name="cbn">{{cite web|last=Woodland|first=Shannon|title=Mr. Smith Goes to Washington|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/700club_mwsmith112404.aspx |publisher=CBN Music|access-date=November 10, 2011}}</ref>

In 2002, Smith released a live concert DVD titled ''Worship'', filmed live in [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] at [[Youth Conference (Christian)|YC Alberta]]. The concert includes songs from both ''Worship'' (2001) and ''Worship Again'' (2002). It immediately topped the Billboard video charts and went [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in both the U.S. and Canada.

Smith won the Male Vocalist of the Year award at the [[GMA Music Awards]] in 2003.<ref name="about">{{cite web|title=GMA Dove Awards Male Vocalist of the Year History|url=http://christianmusic.about.com/od/doves/tp/gmamalevocalisthistory.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=November 10, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219062214/http://christianmusic.about.com/od/doves/tp/gmamalevocalisthistory.htm|archive-date=February 19, 2012}}</ref> The same year he also released his second greatest hits album, ''[[The Second Decade (1993–2003)]]'', which includes a new single called "Signs".

=== Contemporary Christian albums (2004–2010) ===
[[File:Michael W. Smith.jpg|thumb|Michael W. Smith during a concert in Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania in 2005]]
Smith's album, ''[[Healing Rain]]'', was released in 2004 and debuted at No. 11 on the Billboard Hot 200 Chart. The title track rose to No. 1 on the Radio & Records Charts and a music video for the song was released. The album combines the pop style of his previous recordings with the religious feel of his two live worship albums.  It was also nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop/Contemporary Gospel Album]]. In 2006 he released ''[[Stand (Michael W. Smith album)|Stand]]'', which is similar to ''Healing Rain'' (2004) in style and genre but with more Christian-themed songs. Also in 2006, Smith did the score and soundtrack to the film ''[[The Second Chance]]'', which he also starred in. He also released a single from the soundtrack album, "All in the Serve".

In October 2007, he released his third Christmas album, ''[[It's a Wonderful Christmas]]''. On June 20, 2008, Smith recorded his third live Worship album at the [[Lakewood Church]] in [[Houston, Texas]], titled ''[[A New Hallelujah]]''. It was released in October 2008. That same month he began a tour with [[Steven Curtis Chapman]]. In September 2010, he released ''[[Wonder (Michael W. Smith album)|Wonder]]'',<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/reviews/michael-w-smith-wonder-review-von-buseck.aspx Michael W. Smith Reveals the "Wonder" of God's Grace: Review], ''CBN.com''.</ref> which follows the CCM style of ''Healing Rain'' (2004) and ''Stand'' (2006).

=== Orchestral instrumental, hymns, and studio worship albums (2011–2016) ===

Smith's second instrumental album, ''[[Glory (Michael W. Smith album)|Glory]]'', was released on November 22, 2011. Unlike his first instrumental album, ''Freedom'' (2000), this album features a 65-piece orchestra at
[[Associated Independent Recording|AIR Studios Lyndhurts Hall]] in London and Wildwood Recording Studio in Nashville.<ref name="cduniverse">{{cite web|title=Glory|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/productinfo.asp?pid=8622747 |publisher=CD Universe|access-date=December 10, 2011}}</ref> The following year he released his third compilation album, ''[[Decades of Worship]]'' (2012).

Smith's concert in Draper, Utah, on July 24, 2012 was almost canceled due to a complaint filed by a Utah resident on July 16, 2012. He claimed that a show "conflated with prayer and worship" should remain in church or private property, not in the "public's backyard". The following day the city council decided to cancel the concert, but a day later they decided to host the show as planned after all, following a criticism from a Utah evangelical group that equated cancelling the concert to an assault on religious liberty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Christian concert in Draper on again despite lawsuit threat|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/54512569-78/concert-draper-walker-money.html.csp|work=The Salt Lake Tribune|access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> The Mayor of Draper and several city council members were present at the event and were recognized for their support.
