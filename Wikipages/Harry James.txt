'''Harry Haag James''' (March 15, 1916 – July 5, 1983)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=1260/1}}</ref> was an American musician who is best known as a trumpet-playing band leader who led a [[big band]] from 1939 to 1946. He broke up his band for a short period in 1947 but shortly after he reorganized and was active again with his band from then until his death in 1983. He was especially known among musicians for his technical proficiency as well as his [[Tone (musical instrument)|tone]], and was influential on new trumpet players from the late 1930s into the 1940s. He was also an actor in a number of films that usually featured his band.

Harry James was born in [[Albany, Georgia]], United States,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |author=The Editors of Encyclopaedia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Harry-James |title= Harry James - American Musician |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=October 16, 2018}}</ref> the son of Everett Robert James, a bandleader in a traveling circus, the [[Mighty Haag Circus]], and Myrtle Maybelle (Stewart), an acrobat and horseback rider. He started performing with the circus at an early age, first as a [[contortionist]] at age of four, then playing the [[snare drum]] in the band from about the age of six.<ref name="AllmusicBio">{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harry-james-mn0000950571/biography |title=Harry James &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-08-27}}</ref> It was at this age that James was almost trampled by the circus trick horses after he wandered onto the circus track as they were performing their stunts, but he was protected by his mother's pet horse, who stood over him until the other horses rushed by.<ref>{{cite book |last=Levinson |first=Peter |author-link=Peter J.

James started taking trumpet lessons from his father at age eight, and by age twelve he was leading the second band in the Christy Brothers Circus, for which his family was then working.<ref name="AllmusicBio"/> James's father placed him on a strict daily practice schedule. At each session he was given several pages to learn from the [[Arban method|Arban's book]] and was not allowed to pursue any other pastime until he had learned them.{{sfn|Levinson|1999|p=11}} While still a student at Dick Dowling Junior High School, he participated as a regular member of [[Beaumont High School (Beaumont, Texas)|Beaumont High School]]'s Royal Purple Band, and in May 1931 he took first place as trumpet soloist at the Texas Band Teacher's Association's Annual Eastern Division contest held in [[Temple, Texas]].{{sfn|Levinson|1999|p=13}}

==Career==
In 1924, his family settled in [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]], Texas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/ |title=Texas Historic Sites Atlas |publisher=Texas Historical Commission |access-date=May 31, 2017}}</ref> It was here in the early 1930s that James began playing in local dance bands when he was 15 years of age. James played regularly with Herman Waldman's band, and at one performance was noticed by nationally popular [[Ben Pollack]].<ref>[http://www.touchoftonga.com/DavidMulliss/harry-james.html Harry James and his big band]. Touchoftonga.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-21.</ref> In 1935 he joined Pollack's band, but left at the start of 1937 to join [[Benny Goodman]]'s orchestra, where he stayed through 1938. He was nicknamed "The Hawk" early in his career for his ability to [[sight-read]]. A common joke was that if a fly landed on his written music, Harry James would play it. His low range had a warmth associated with the [[cornet]] and even the [[flugelhorn]], but this sound was underrecorded in favor of James' brilliant high register.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/12/prweb11385930.htm |title=Sheffield Lab Recordings Releases The Harry James Sessions: Harry James and His Big Band |last=Herrmann |first=Cynthia |date= December 11, 2013 |website=PRWeb |publisher=Sheffield Lab |access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref>

With financial backing from Goodman,{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=tape 2, side B}} James debuted his own [[big band]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, in January 1939, but it didn't click until adding a string section in 1941.<ref>''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', July 18, 1942</ref> Subsequently, known as Harry James and His Music Makers,<ref name="jazz">{{cite web |url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/james-harry-haag |title=James, Harry (Haag) |publisher=Jazz.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004184205/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/james-harry-haag |archive-date=October 4, 2012 }}</ref> it produced the [[hit record|hit]] "[[You Made Me Love You (I Didn't Want to Do It)|You Made Me Love You]]", which peaked at no. 5 on [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard's'']] National Best Selling Retail Records chart for the week ending November 18, 1941. During its 18-week chart run, the single spent ten non-consecutive weeks in the Top Ten, from early November 1941 until late January 1942.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}} He and his band appeared in three [[Hollywood]] films: ''[[Private Buckaroo]]'' and ''[[Springtime in the Rockies]]'' (both 1942), and ''[[Two Girls and a Sailor]]'' (1944). James toured with the band into the 1980s, and as of July 2018 the Harry James Orchestra, led by Fred Radke, was still very much in business.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fredradke.com/fredradkebio.asp |title=The Life of Harry James |publisher=Fredradke.com |access-date=2015-08-27}}</ref>

===Bandleader===
James' band was the first high-profile orchestra to feature vocalist [[Frank Sinatra]], who signed a one-year, $75 a week contract  with it in 1939, ($1,500 in 2020). James wanted to change Sinatra's name to 'Frankie Satin', but the singer refused.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2010/10/frank-sinatra-201010 |title=The Night Sinatra Happened |publisher=vanityfair.com |access-date=2016-01-29}}</ref>  Sinatra only worked seven months before leaving to join [[Tommy Dorsey]]'s outfit.<ref name=pc1a>{{Pop Chronicles 40s|1|A}}</ref>  The James band's featured female vocalist was [[Helen Forrest]], and his later band included drummer [[Buddy Rich]]<ref name=pc1a/> and bassist [[Thurman Teague]].<ref>"Thurman Teague".

====Radio====
James' orchestra succeeded [[Glenn Miller]]'s on a program sponsored by [[Chesterfield (cigarette)|Chesterfield Cigarettes]] in 1942, when Miller disbanded his orchestra to enter the Army. In 1945, James and his orchestra had a summer replacement program for [[Danny Kaye]]'s program on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Radio|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/2217567/harry_james_7745/|agency=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|date=June 7, 1945|page=21|via = [[Newspapers.com]]|access-date = April 15, 2015}} {{Open access}}</ref> He also led the orchestra for ''[[Call for Music]]'', which was broadcast on CBS February 13, 1948 - April 16, 1948, and on [[NBC]] April 20, 1948 - June 29, 1948.<ref name="dunningota">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn |url-access=registration |quote=Call For Music, popular music and song. |last=Dunning |first=John |author-link=John Dunning (detective fiction author) |title=On the Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York, NY |isbn=978-0-19-507678-3 |page=[https://archive.org/details/onairencyclop00dunn/page/131 131] |edition=Revised |access-date=2019-11-22}}</ref>

====Film====
James recorded many popular [[Gramophone record|records]] and appeared in many Hollywood movies. He played trumpet in the 1950 film ''[[Young Man with a Horn (film)|Young Man with a Horn]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0416548/ |title=Harry James|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-27}}</ref> dubbing [[Kirk Douglas]]. The album from the movie charted at #1, with James backing big band singer and actress [[Doris Day]]. James's recording of "[[I'm Beginning to See the Light]]" appears in the motion picture ''[[My Dog Skip (film)|My Dog Skip]]'' (2000). His music is also featured in the [[Woody Allen]] film ''[[Hannah and Her Sisters]]''. James's recording of "[[It's Been a Long, Long Time]]" is featured in ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]'' and in Marvel's ''[[Avengers: Endgame]].''<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/04/avengers-endgame-song-long-long-time-cap-peggy-dance |title=Avengers: The Hidden Meaning Behind That Final Endgame Song |last=Robinson |first=Joanna |date=April 26, 2019 |website=Vanity Fair |access-date=October 17, 2019}}</ref>

== Musical style and reception==
=== Influences ===
With James's childhood spent as a musician in a traveling circus, he picked up a flamboyant style that utilized such techniques as heavy vibrato, half valve and lip glissandi, valve and lip trills, and valve tremolos. These techniques were popular at the time in what was known as [[Louis Armstrong and His Hot Five|"hot" jazz]], epitomized by James's idol [[Louis Armstrong]], but somewhat fell out of favor by the 1950s with the advent of [[Cool jazz|"cool" jazz]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/music/jazz/ch/12/outline.aspx |title=W W Norton & Company Study Space: Jazz, Ch 12 Cool Jazz and Hard Bop |publisher=wwnorton.com / Scott DeVeaux and Gary Giddins |access-date=2016-01-20}}</ref> James's rigorous regime of practice as a child resulted in an exceptional technical proficiency in the more classical techniques of range, fingering and tonguing. Growing up in the South, James was also exposed to [[blues music]], which had an additional influence on his style. As James explained, "I was brought up in Texas with the blues – when I was eleven or twelve years old down in what they call 'barbecue row' I used to sit in with the guys that had the broken bottlenecks on their guitars, playing the blues; that's all we knew."<ref>{{cite AV media |title=[[The Merv Griffin Show]] |date=November 15, 1977}}</ref> After hearing James solo on several numbers at a Benny Goodman one-nighter, Armstrong enthused to his friend and Goodman [[vibraphone|vibraphonist]] [[Lionel Hampton]], "That white boy – he plays like a jig!"{{sfn|Levinson|1999|p=50}}

=== Move towards pop ===
After James left Benny Goodman's band in 1939 to form his own band, he soon found that leading a commercially viable musical group required a broader set of skills than those needed to be a gifted musician playing in someone else's band. The James band ran into financial trouble, and it became increasingly difficult for James to pay salaries and keep the band together. In 1940, James lost his contract with [[Columbia Records]] (he returned in 1941), and Frank Sinatra left the band that January. It was not long after this that James made a pivotal decision: he would adopt a "sweeter" style that added strings to the band, and the band would deliver tunes that were in more of a "pop" vein and less true to its jazz roots. From a commercial standpoint, the decision paid off as James soon enjoyed a string of chart topping hits that provided commercial success for him and his band. Indeed, a U.S. Treasury report released in 1945 listed Harry James and [[Betty Grable]] as the highest-paid couple in the nation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/harry-james/ |title=Hollywood Star Walk: Harry James |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |access-date=2016-01-20}}</ref>

While James remained commercially successful and personally committed to his music, some critics sought to find fault. In [[Peter Levinson|Peter Levinson's]] 1999 biography, [[Dan Morgenstern]], the respected critic and Director of the Institute of Jazz Studies, called the 1941 release of the latter Grammy Hall of Fame inducted "You Made Me Love You" "the record that the jazz critics never forgave Harry James for recording."{{sfn|Levinson|1999|p=94}}  With James continuing to employ his flamboyant style on pop hits through the 1940s, his playing was often labeled as "schmaltzy"<ref>{{cite book |last=Yanow |first=Scott |author-link=Scott Yanow |date=2000 |title=Swing |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntabwaEh2uQC |isbn=0-87930-600-9}}</ref> and dismissed by the critics, although radio discs from this period reveal James's continued commitment to jazz. James's jazz releases during this period, while not as numerous, include a variety of modern arrangements from [[Neal Hefti]], Frank Devenport, [[Johnny Richards]] and [[Jimmy Mundy]] that often inspired his musicians, and as [[Bebop|bop]] surpassed [[Swing music|swing]] by the late 1940s, James was surprisingly open to its influence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/1948-1949-mw0000959970 |last=Yanow |first=Scott |title=1948-1949 |website=AllMusic |access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref>

=== Return to Big Band jazz===
[[File:Harry James (1970s publicity photo).jpg|alt=Black and white photo portrait of a man in a suit playing the trumpet|thumb|Publicity photo of James, {{circa}}{{nbsp}}1975]]
After coasting through the mid-1950s, James made a complete reevaluation of where he was heading in his musical career. [[Count Basie]] provided the impetus by making a significant comeback with his newly formed "16 Men Swinging" band, and James wanted a band with a decided Basie flavor.{{sfn|Levinson|1999|p=195}} James signed with [[Capitol Records]] in 1955, and two years later, after releasing new studio versions of many of his previously released songs from Columbia Records, James recorded ten new tracks for an album entitled ''[[Wild About Harry!]]''. This album was the first in a series released on Capitol, and continuing later on [[MGM Records|MGM]], representative of the Basie style that James adopted during this period, with some of the arrangements provided by former Basie saxophonist and arranger [[Ernie Wilkins]], whom James hired for his own band.<ref name="Discogs">{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Harry-James-And-His-Orchestra-Wild-About-Harry/release/5618807 |title= Harry James And His Orchestra – Wild About Harry |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2015-12-18}}</ref>

While James never completely regained favor with jazz critics during his lifetime in spite of his return to more jazz-oriented releases in the late 1950s and into the 1960s, contemporary opinion of his work has shifted. Recent reissues such as Capitol's 2012 7-disc set ''The Capitol Vaults Jazz Series: Gene Krupa and Harry James'' have prompted new, more favorable analyses. In 2014, [[Marc Myers]] of JazzWax commented, "[James's] band of the mid-1940s was more modern than most of the majors, and in 1949 he led one of the finest bands of the year." And on James's releases from 1958 to 1961, Myers noted, "The James band during this period has been eclipsed by bands led by [[Count Basie|Basie]], [[Maynard Ferguson]] and [[Stan Kenton]]. While each served up its own brand of magnificence, James produced more consistently brilliant tracks than the others... virtually everything James recorded during this period was an uncompromising, swinging gem."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jazzwax.com/2014/01/harry-james-1958-61.html |title=Harry James: 1958–'61 |publisher=jazzwax.com / Marc Myers |access-date=2016-01-20 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202160519/http://www.jazzwax.com/2014/01/harry-james-1958-61.html |archive-date=February 2, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

James felt strongly about the music he both played and recorded. In 1972 while in London, he did an interview with the English jazz critic [[Steve Voce]], who asked if the biggest audience was for the commercial numbers he had recorded. James visibly bristled, replying "That would depend on for whom you are playing. If you're playing for a jazz audience, I'm pretty sure that some of the jazz things we do would be a lot more popular than 'Sleepy Lagoon,' and if we're playing at a country club or playing Vegas, in which we have many, many types of people, then I'm sure that 'Sleepy Lagoon' would be more popular at that particular time. But I really get bugged about these people talking about commercial tunes, because to me, if you're gonna be commercial, you're gonna stand on your head and make funny noises and do idiotic things. I don't think we've ever recorded or played one tune that I didn't particularly love to play. Otherwise, I wouldn't play it."{{sfn|Levinson|1999|p=251}}

==Personal life==
James was married three times, first to singer [[Louise Tobin]] on May 4, 1935, with whom he had two sons, Harry Jeffrey James (b. 1941) and Timothy Ray James (b. 1942).<ref name="NYTObituary">{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=John |date=July 6, 1983 |title=Harry James, Trumpeter and Band Leader, Dies at 67 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/06/obituaries/harry-james-trumpter-and-band-leader-dies-at-67.html |work=The New York Times |access-date=July 9, 2018}}</ref> They divorced in 1943.<ref name="AllmusicBio"/> Later that year he married actress [[Betty Grable]].

James owned several [[Thoroughbred]] racehorses that won races such as the [[California Breeders' Champion Stakes]] (1951) and the [[San Vicente Stakes]] (1954). He was also a founding investor in the [[Atlantic City Race Course]]. His knowledge of horse racing was demonstrated during a 1958 appearance on ''[[The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour]]'' entitled "[[List of The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour episodes|Lucy Wins A Racehorse]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0637536/|title= The Lucy Desi Comedy Hour Lucy Wins A Racehorse|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=2015-08-27}}</ref>

===Readers' polls===
[[Metronome magazine]] conducted annual readers' polls ranking the top jazz musician on each instrument. The winners were invited to join an ensemble known as the [[Metronome All-Stars]] that was assembled for studio recordings. The studio sessions were held in the years 1939–42, 1946–53, and 1956, and typically resulted in two tracks which allowed each participant a one chorus solo. Harry James was chosen to play trumpet with the Metronome All-Stars in 1939, 1940 and 1941.

A similar annual readers' poll conducted by [[Down Beat|Downbeat magazine]] selected James as the best trumpet instrumentalist for the years 1937,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=743 |title=1937 DownBeat Readers Poll |publisher=Downbeat Magazine |access-date=2015-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106055100/http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=743 |archive-date=January 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> 1938<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=744 |title=1938 DownBeat Readers Poll |publisher=Downbeat Magazine |access-date=2015-12-27}}</ref> and 1939,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=745 |title=1939 DownBeat Readers Poll |publisher=Downbeat Magazine |access-date=2015-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160106031811/http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=745 |archive-date=January 6, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and as favorite soloist for 1942.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=748 |title=1942 DownBeat Readers Poll |publisher=Downbeat Magazine |access-date=2015-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105184636/http://www.downbeat.com/default.asp?sect=stories&subsect=story_detail&sid=748 |archive-date=January 5, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
