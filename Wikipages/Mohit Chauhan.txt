===Bollywood Debut:2002-07===
After the massive success of "Dooba Dooba" and "Boondein", which earned him awards and recognition, Chauhan was approached by composer [[Sandesh Shandilya]] to sing in films.

[[A.R. Rahman]], who had noticed Chauhan at the award win for Silk Route, called him to sing "Khoon Chala" for the film ''[[Rang De Basanti]]''. The song proved to be a breakthrough for him, and in 2007, he followed this up with his first major hit song in the [[Pritam]]-composed romantic ballad "Tum Se Hi" for the film ''Jab We Met'', penned by [[Irshad Kamil]]; both Pritam and writer-director [[Imtiaz Ali (director)|Imtiaz Ali]] wanted Chauhan to lend his voice for this romantic track.

Among his 2010 songs, the romantic number "Pee Loon" from ''[[Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai]]'', picturized on [[Emraan Hashmi]], was a rage.
