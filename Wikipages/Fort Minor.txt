==History==
===Formation and ''The Rising Tied'' (2004–06)===
Mike Shinoda joined Fort Minor as a vocalist. Shinoda uses the name Fort Minor for his collaborations with Ryan Patrick Maginn (Ryu) and Takbir Bashir (Tak), who themselves hail from the underground hip hop group [[Styles of Beyond]].

Shinoda began recording songs for this side project following the release of [[Collision Course (EP)|Collision Course]] in November 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1497764/03042005/shinoda_mike.jhtml|title=Mike Shinoda's Solo Album May Divide Linkin Park Fans|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=March 4, 2005|publisher=MTV News|access-date=December 27, 2008}}</ref> ''[[Fort Minor: We Major]]'' was a [[mixtape]] by Shinoda and [[DJ Green Lantern]] to promote his upcoming studio album.

===Indefinite hiatus (2006–15)===
In November 2006, Fort Minor released a video for "Where'd You Go". Shinoda has stated he felt the video was a nice wrap-up for Fort Minor.<ref name=":0" /> Also in November, Shinoda stated that Fort Minor was currently on hiatus, because of his dedication to [[Linkin Park]].

In 2006, [[Skylar Grey]] released an exclusive version of "Where'd You Go" to radio stations, made by herself. Mike does not appear on this version.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fort Minor Unofficial: Where'd Mike Go? |url=http://fortminor.co.uk/2006/09/whered-mike-go.html |date=2009-03-20 |access-date=2015-06-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320232054/http://fortminor.co.uk/2006/09/whered-mike-go.html |archive-date=March 20, 2009 }}</ref>

In the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' One-hit Wonders of the 2000s, Fort Minor (along with Holly Brook and Jonah Matranga) were listed at No.&nbsp;19, due to the success of "Where'd You Go" (since it was Fort Minor's only single that reached the top 25).<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266486/one-hit-wonders-of-the-2000s-page-2 |title=One-Hit Wonders of the 2000s |year=2009 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=22 July 2011}}</ref> In an LPU Chat in early 2012, Mike Shinoda said there is a possibility for a new Fort Minor album after Linkin Park's sixth studio album, which was planned for release in 2014. In October 2013, on the Nick Catchdubs remix of Linkin Park's "[[Living Things (Linkin Park album)|Skin to Bone]]", Ryu from Styles of Beyond stated that Fort Minor's mission isn't over, hinting at a second studio album.

==="Welcome" single (2015) and second hiatus===
On June 21, 2015, Shinoda released a new, non-album single titled "[[Welcome (Fort Minor song)|Welcome]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mikeshinoda/status/612847063898853376|title=Mike Shinoda on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=23 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/fortminor/status/612849100099223552|title=Fort Minor on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=23 June 2015}}</ref> Fort Minor also appeared as the musical guest on the [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] late-night talk show ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'' on June 22, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://teamcoco.com/schedule/2015-06-22/monday/fort-minor|title=Conan Show Guests Schedule: June 22 - 25, 2015 @ TeamCoco.com|work=teamcoco.com|access-date=23 June 2015}}</ref> No new announcement has been made and the future of Fort Minor is currently unknown. However, ever since [[Chester Bennington]]’s suicide on July 20, 2017, Shinoda has been performing Fort Minor songs as a solo act.

===Status of Fort Minor (2020)===

In September 2020, Shinoda addressed the status of Fort Minor on the podcast ''The Green Room with Neil Griffiths'', saying "I'm Fort Minor the way [[Trent Reznor]] is [[Nine Inch Nails]]. Like, Nine Inch Nails is a group effort, but if Trent doesn't do it, it's not a thing."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://thepodcasts.com.au/green-room-with-neil-griffiths |title=The Green Room With Neil Griffiths - Mike Shinoda |last=Griffiths |first=Neil |publisher=Handshake Media Pty Ltd. |date=September 10, 2020 |website=thePodcasts.com.au |access-date=April 24, 2021}}</ref>

He added that there is "no answer" about what's next for Fort Minor. "With Fort Minor I brought different people in to do different things and had some amazing features. I still believe that one of Black Thought's best verses of all time is on ''Right Now'' on the Fort Minor record and it just happens to be on my record. That would have been one my favourite verses he's ever done whether or not it was for that record. For me, there's a bit of a high bar. I don't know why."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://themusic.com.au/news/fort-minor-mike-shinoda-green-room-podcast-neil-griffiths/hVedmZibmp0/14-09-20/ |title='There's A Bit Of A High Bar': Mike Shinoda Reveals Status Of Fort Minor |last=Griffiths |first=Neil |publisher=Handshake Media Pty Ltd. |date=September 13, 2020 |website=theMusic.com.au |access-date=April 24, 2021}}</ref>
