'''Hella''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[math rock]] band from [[Sacramento, California]]. The primary members of the band are [[Spencer Seim]] on [[electric guitar]] and [[Zach Hill]] on [[drum kit|drums]]. In 2005, the band expanded their live band by adding [[Dan Elkan]] on vocals, rhythm guitar, sampler and synthesizer and Jonathan Hischke on synth bass guitar for their Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard tour. In 2006 they reformed as a five-piece line-up including Seim, Hill, Carson McWhirter (of [[The Advantage]]), Aaron Ross & Josh Hill. In 2009, the band was reduced back to core members Hill and Seim.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
As teenagers [[Spencer Seim]] and [[Zach Hill]] were both members of the [[Northern California]] band Legs on Earth along with Josh Hill on guitar and Julian Imsdahl on bass and vocals. The band achieved some moderate local success, becoming renowned for their wild live shows, young age, and [[Primus (band)|Primus]]-esque sound. Zach Hill described Legs on Earth in an interview as pop music but in the way  [[Devo]] and [[Talking Heads]] were considered pop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nokilli.com/indie/hellaInt.htm |title=Sacramento Underground Music |publisher=Nokilli.com |access-date=2011-10-18}}</ref> They released one album in 1999 called ''Lasers & Saviors'' on local record label Para-Sight Records, now out of print. In April 2000 they went on hiatus and later broke up. Imsdahl later joined the band Grandstream (formerly known as Little California), and was previously in the band Eraserhead. Hill and Seim decided they wanted to continue playing together and pursue a less mainstream sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hella-mn0000672835/biography|title=Hella - Biography & History - AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2 July 2017}}</ref> According to Hill, they didn't always intend to remain a duo, though: "[We] had intentions to start a band that was like… kinda like what we were doing with just the two of us, but with more people. But, we couldn't find the other people so we decided to do it just with the two of us."<ref name="fishrap">{{cite news | last=Maylone | first=Sean | title=Hella is not big band jazz, but neither are you | date=10 March 2005 | publisher=[[Fish Rap Live!]] }}</ref> Their name is simply a reference to the [[slang]] word "[[wikt:hella|hella]]" that was common throughout Northern California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenitmustbetrue.com/hella/hella2.htm |title=Then It Must Be True - Hella |publisher=Then It Must Be True |access-date=2011-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927125635/http://www.thenitmustbetrue.com/hella/hella2.htm |archive-date=2011-09-27 }}</ref>

Hella's earliest recording was the self-released ''Leather Diamond'' EP, hand-assembled in a nondescript cardboard sleeve and sold at some of their first shows.

On March 19, 2002, they debuted proper with the full-length ''[[Hold Your Horse Is]]'' LP on [[5 Rue Christine]] (a subsidiary of [[Olympia, Washington]]-based [[Kill Rock Stars]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/hella/hold-your-horse-is.htm|title=Hella - Hold Your Horse Is - Review - Stylus Magazine|date=20 November 2007|website=archive.org|access-date=2 July 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120170710/http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/hella/hold-your-horse-is.htm|archive-date=20 November 2007}}</ref> The ''Falam Dynasty'' 7" was also released that year.

===2003—present===
After the release of ''Hold Your Horse Is'', 2003 saw Hella begin to deviate from the basic framework in the studio, although their live sound remained largely unchanged. Released on June 17 of that year, Hella's ''Bitches Ain't Shit But Good People'' EP (originally a vinyl only release) featured many firsts for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11756-bitches-aint-shit-but-good-people-ep-total-bugs-bunny-on-wild-bass-ep/|title=Hella: Bitches Ain't Shit But Good People EP / Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass EP Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref> An earlier recorded (''Leather Diamond'') version of a song from their first LP, "Republic of Rough And Ready", became their first widely released song to feature vocals (provided by friend of the band Dan Elkan). A version of "1-800-Ghost-Dance" with vocals by Elkan was available as a downloadable mp3 on the band's website in late 2002. The ''Bitches'' EP also found Hella using [[bass guitar]], [[synthesizer]], and [[drum machine]] for the first time. ''Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass'', also an EP, was released on August 26 and featured the use of synth, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|sampler]], and drum machine and an apparent influence from 8-bit [[video game music]], first hinted at on the opening track of ''Hold Your Horse Is'', "The D. Elkan". Hella rounded out the year with a split live double CD with San Francisco, California-based band [[Dilute (band)|Dilute]].

Hella released their second full-length LP in 2004, ''The Devil Isn't Red''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-devil-isnt-red-mw0000322849|title=The Devil Isn't Red Review|work=Allmusic|access-date=6 July 2017}}</ref> Other releases for the year included a split 7" (with [[Four Tet]]) and a [[Special edition|limited edition]], Japan-only release of the three-song ''Acoustics'' EP.

For their 2005 release, Hella again experimented with their sound in the studio. ''Church Gone Wild/Chirpin Hard'', released through [[Suicide Squeeze Records]], is a double-solo album, with Zach Hill and Seim each recording a whole disc's worth of material independent of each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11757-church-gone-wildchirpin-hard/|title=Hella: Church Gone Wild/Chirpin' Hard Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref> Hill's disc, ''Church Gone Wild'', is a 56-minute noise piece which featured Zach doing all the vocals and instruments, save for a few guest appearances; while Seim's disc, ''Chirpin Hard'', again experiments with the fusion of 8-bit Nintendo music with [[punk rock|punk]] and [[math rock]]. Hella also expanded their live band to a quartet in 2005, adding [[Dan Elkan]] on vocals, [[rhythm guitar]], and synthesizer, and Jonathan Hischke on bass guitar in order to play songs from ''Total Bugs Bunny on Wild Bass'' and ''Church Gone Wild/Chirpin Hard'' live, in most cases for the first time. This line-up toured the US in support of [[Out Hud]] in Spring, [[System of a Down]], [[The Mars Volta]], [[Les Claypool]], and [[Dillinger Escape Plan]] in the fall as well as numerous headlining dates in the U.S. as well as visits to Japan, Spain and the UK. The show  from October 8th at Arco & Oakland Arenas was documented by R.T. Thomas and self-released in July 2007 on DVD.

A [[DVD]]/[[CD]] EP release titled ''Concentration Face/Homeboy'' was released on November 8, 2005 on 5RC Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killrockstars.com/basement/discography/discography-5rc.html |title=KRS Complete Discography |publisher=Killrockstars.com |access-date=2011-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070413125815/http://www.killrockstars.com/basement/discography/discography-5rc.html |archive-date=2007-04-13 }}</ref> The DVD features almost 3 hours of footage from their 2004 Japan tour, mostly consisting of performances from the first two albums.

In 2006, Hella consisted of Spencer Seim, Zach Hill, Hill's cousin Josh (who also played in Legs on Earth), Seim's Advantage bandmate Carson McWhirter, and Aaron Ross. The first release from this line-up, entitled ''There's No 666 in Outer Space'', was released on January 30, 2007 on [[Ipecac Recordings]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/9828-theres-no-666-in-outer-space/|title=Hella: There's No 666 in Outer Space Album Review - Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=29 July 2017}}</ref> This album was released in 2008 as a double 180g vinyl on Black Diamond Records with new artwork by Mayka Finkelstein-Amrami.

As of August 2008, In an interview with Exclaim Magazine regarding his solo effort, Zach stated that "Hella is a real grey area in general right now".<ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Josiah |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid2=850&fid1=32748&csid1=124 |title=Zach Hill Astrological Straits |website=Exclaim.ca |date=2008-07-29 |access-date=2016-09-09}}</ref> The future of the band seemed to be up in the air.

On Thursday, March 12, 2009, a blog post on Hella's MySpace page revealed that Hella once again consisted of only core members Hill and Seim, and that the band was working on writing and recording a new album, due to be finished later that year. It also revealed that an international tour may have been in the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=147707417&blogId=476267258 |title=New record! |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=2011-10-07 |access-date=2011-10-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=2009-02-07 }}</ref>

On September 4, 2010, Hella announced they had eight tracks ready for their new album.

As of 2011, Hella is signed to [[Sargent House]], who released their most recent album, [[Tripper (Hella album)|Tripper]], on August 30, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Breihan |first=Tom |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/43483-hella-return-as-duo-for-new-album/ |title=Hella Return as Duo for New Album &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2011-08-09 |access-date=2011-10-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/hella-tripper|title=Hella Tripper - Album  Review - Slant Magazine|website=slantmagazine.com|access-date=2 July 2017}}</ref>

As of 2021, little to no information has surfaced about new Hella projects. The band is considered by some to be in indefinite hiatus.

==Side projects==
In addition to their work in Hella, Seim and Zach Hill have also recorded with a number of [[side project]]s.

Seim plays drums in [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] [[theme music]] [[cover band]] [[The Advantage]] (a reference to the [[NES Advantage]] controller), notable for using only guitar, bass guitar, and drums to replicate the [[8-bit]] programmed music of the games. The genre has been called [[Nintendocore]] and The Advantage are credited with pioneering it. Seim has also released a solo album under the moniker [[sBACH]]. Recently Seim, playing drums, has formed Solos with guitarist and vocalist Aaron Ross (formerly of Hella). Their debut album "Beast of Both Worlds" was released on Sept 11 2012 on Joyful Noise records.

Hill has recorded albums with [[Marnie Stern]], Tough Guy Fantasy/Arctic Boys, Flössin, [[Crime in Choir]], [[Nervous Cop]] (with drummer [[Greg Saunier]] of [[Deerhoof]] and harpist [[Joanna Newsom]]), Damsel (with guitarist Nels Cline), Friend/Enemy (with Tim Kinsella, Sam Zurick, Todd Mattei, Jim Becker, Graeme Gibson, Caryn Culp, Emma Grace Lansangan, Nick Marci, Chris Powell, Azita Youssefi), Zach Hill and the Holy Smokes (whose first release was accompanied by a 138-page book written and illustrated by Hill), as well as playing drums for [[Chino Moreno]]'s band [[Team Sleep]], The Ladies, Kenseth Thibideau and Marty Anderson's band Howard Hello and [[Jeordie White]] and [[Chris Goss (U.S.)|Chris Goss]]'s band [[Goon Moon]]. More recently, Hill has teamed up with [[Mick Barr]] from [[Octis]] and [[Orthrelm]] and together have released the LPs ''Shred Earthship'' on [[5 Rue Christine]] and ''Volume 2'' on the Austrian label Rock Is Hell. ''Volume 2'' consists of the two longest tracks from the ''Shred Earthship'' sessions. Hill's best known project outside of Hella now is perhaps experimental hip hop outfit [[Death Grips]], who have gone on to achieve a cult following of their own right and widespread critical acclaim.

Both Hill and Hischke are members of [[El Grupo Nuevo de Omar Rodriguez-Lopez]] with [[Juan Alderete]], [[Cedric Bixler-Zavala]] and [[Omar Rodríguez-López]], the first of three records produced by the group is ''[[Cryptomnesia (album)|Cryptomnesia]]'', which was released on May 5, 2009.

In 2008, Hischke formed the band [[Dot Hacker]] along with [[Josh Klinghoffer]].

The song "Biblical Violence" is featured on episode 24 of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast.
