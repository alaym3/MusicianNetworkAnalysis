'''Susanne Aartun Sundfør''' ({{IPA-no|sʉˈsànːə ˈòːɣtʉːn ˈsʉ̀nføːɣ}} (local Haugesund dialect; [[Help:IPA/Norwegian|[sʉˈsɑ̀nːə ˈɔ̀ʈːʉːn ˈsʉ̀nføːr]]] in Urban East ("standard") Norwegian);{{check|date=June 2021}} born 19 March 1986) is a Norwegian singer-songwriter and record producer. Born and raised in [[Haugesund]], Sundfør embarked on her musical career two years prior to the release of her [[Susanne Sundfør (album)|eponymous debut album]] (2007), which reached number three on the Norwegian album chart. It was followed by ''[[Take One (Susanne Sundfør album)|Take One]]'', a live album consisting of songs from her debut. Her second studio album, ''[[The Brothel]]'', was released in 2010 to commercial success in Norway, peaking at number one and becoming the best-selling album of that year. The album saw a shift from the piano-driven pop of previous releases towards a more ambitious and [[electronic music|electronic]] direction. In 2011, she released a live instrumental album composed solely of synthesizers, ''[[A Night at Salle Pleyel]]'', serving as a commission piece.

Her third studio album, ''[[The Silicone Veil]]'' (2012) topped the Norwegian album chart and received critical acclaim. She had her international breakthrough in 2015 with her fourth studio album, ''[[Ten Love Songs]]'', which saw Sundfør experimenting with an electronic [[dance pop]] sound. The album reached number one and garnered universal acclaim. Her fifth studio album ''[[Music for People in Trouble]]'' (2017) represented a departure from the electronic-driven sound of previous records in favor of a return to her roots as a [[contemporary folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter. The album reached number one as well, making it her fourth consecutive album to achieve this feat.

==Early life==
Sundfør was born in [[Haugesund]] on 19 March 1986.<ref name="AllMusic"/> She is the granddaughter of theologian and linguist [[Kjell Aartun]].<ref name="imusic"/> After attending a music high school, she began making music as a hobby.<ref name="CMU"/> She stated she started playing music when she was six, saying: "I would go to these classes where we would just sing and play the tambourine. You know, it wasn't really serious, but I really liked it so I started playing the violin when I was eight, then taking piano lessons when I was nine, and then singing lessons when I was twelve. So I was playing music at an early stage, but I didn't really take it that seriously. I wasn't practicing that much or anything. Then I went to a music high school, and I guess that's what you'd call my education in music."<ref name="CMU"/> Sundfør also studied English and Art at the [[University of Bergen]].<ref name="imusic">{{cite web |url=https://imusic.am/ar/WQ8xhB |title=Susanne Sundfor |work=imusic.am |accessdate=15 September 2017 |archive-date=21 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210321082449/https://imusic.am/ar/WQ8xhB |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Sundfør has stated that she is an atheist, but that she "doesn't think science can explain everything that surrounds us," continuing: "Sometimes it's fun to imagine that there is a 'bigger' meaning, a connection, something we have not yet thought about and is expecting to reach a higher level of understanding.
