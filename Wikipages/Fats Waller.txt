'''Thomas Wright''' "'''Fats'''" '''Waller''' (May 21, 1904 – December 15, 1943) was an American [[jazz]] pianist, organist, composer, violinist, singer, and comedic entertainer.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3LJvYjBXak4C&q=%22Josephine+hall%22++%22cotton+club%22&pg=PR11|title=Fats Waller on the Air: The Radio Broadcasts and Discography|first=Stephen|last=Taylor|date=June 7, 2019|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810856561|access-date=June 7, 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> His innovations in the Harlem [[stride (music)|stride style]] laid the groundwork for modern jazz piano. His best-known compositions, "[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]" and "[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]", were inducted into the [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award|Grammy Hall of Fame]] in 1984 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last=Tenenholtz |first=David |title=Waller, Fats (Thomas Wright) |url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/waller-fats-thomas-wright |publisher=JAZZ.COM |access-date=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406062100/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/waller-fats-thomas-wright |archive-date=April 6, 2009 }}</ref> Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, [[Andy Razaf]].

It is likely that he composed many more popular songs than he has been credited: when in financial difficulties he had a habit of selling songs to other writers and performers who claimed them as their own.<ref name=Tyle/>

Waller started playing the piano at the age of six, and became a professional organist at age of 15. By the age of 18, he was a recording artist. Waller's first recordings, "Muscle Shoals Blues" and "Birmingham Blues", were made in October 1922 for [[Okeh Records]].<ref name="TwentiesInAmerica" /> That year, he also made his first player [[piano roll]], "Got to Cool My Doggies Now".<ref name="TwentiesInAmerica" /> Waller's first published composition, "[[Squeeze Me]]", was published in 1924.<ref name="EncycWorldBio" /> He became one of the most popular performers of his era, touring internationally and achieving critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe.

==Early life==
Waller was the seventh child of 11 (five of whom survived childhood) born to Adeline Locket Waller, a musician, and Reverend Edward Martin Waller, a trucker and pastor in New York City.<ref name="EncycWorldBio">{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of World Biography (vol. 16)|date=2004|publisher=Gale|location=Detroit|pages=81–82|edition=2nd|chapter=Thomas Wright Waller}}</ref><ref name=":1" /> He started playing the piano when he was six and graduated to playing the organ at his father's church four years later. His mother instructed him in his youth, and he attended other music lessons, paying for them by working in a grocery store.<ref name="EncycWorldBio" /> Waller attended [[DeWitt Clinton High School]] for one semester, but left school at 15 to work as an organist at the [[Lincoln Theatre (Harlem)|Lincoln Theater]] in [[Harlem]], where he earned $32 a week.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pelisson|first1=Gerard J.|last2=Garvey III|first2=James A.|title=The Castle on the Parkway|date=2009|publisher=The Hutch Press|location=Scarsdale, New York|page=40}}</ref><ref name="EncycAfAmMus">{{cite book|last1=Ivy|first1=James|editor1-last=Price|editor1-first=Emmett G.|title=Encyclopedia of African American Music|date=2011|publisher=Greenwood|location=Santa Barbara|pages=986–987|chapter=Waller, Fats (1904–1943)}}</ref> Within 12 months he had composed his first [[ragtime|rag]].

==Career==
Waller became one of the most popular performers of his era, finding critical and commercial success in the United States and Europe. He was also a prolific songwriter. Pianist and composer [[Oscar Levant]] called Waller "the black [[Vladimir Horowitz|Horowitz]]".<ref name="Palmer">{{cite book |last1=Palmer |first1=David |title=All You Need Is love: The Story of Popular Music |date=1976 |publisher=Grossman |isbn=0-670-11448-0}}</ref> Working with his long-time songwriting partner, lyricist Andy Razaf, Fats also wrote the music and/or performed in several successful [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musicals, including 1928's "[[Keep Shufflin']]",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.playbill.com/personlistpage/person-list?production=00000150-aea1-d936-a7fd-eef5dd4b0004&type=op#oc |title=Keep Shufflin' |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=27 February 1928 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |access-date=26 January 2021 |quote=Keep Shufflin' - Music: Thomas "Fats" Waller - "On The White Keys"}}</ref> 1929's "[[Hot Chocolates]]"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.playbill.com/personlistpage/person-list?production=00000150-aea3-d936-a7fd-eef7ea4e0002&type=op#oc |title=Hot Chocolates |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=20 June 1929 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |access-date=26 January 2021 |quote=Thomas "Fats" Waller - Music}}</ref> and (with lyricist [[George Marion, Jr.]]) 1943's "[[Early To Bed]]".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.playbill.com/personlistpage/person-list?production=00000150-ae93-d936-a7fd-eef749a60004&type=op#op |title=Early To Bed |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=17 June 1943 |website=Playbill.com |publisher=Playbill, Inc. |access-date=26 January 2021 |quote=Thomas "Fats" Waller - Music}}</ref>

Waller is believed to have composed many novelty tunes in the 1920s and 1930s and sold them for small sums,<ref name="Tyle">{{cite web|title=''I Can't Give You Anything but Love'' (1928)|author= Tyle, Chris|date= 2012| publisher= JazzStandards.com|url=http://www.jazzstandards.com/compositions-1/icantgiveyouanythingbutlove.htm|access-date=April 4, 2014}}</ref> attributed to another composer and lyricist.<ref name="maurice" />

Standards attributed to Waller, sometimes controversially, include "[[I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby]]". The song was made famous by [[Adelaide Hall]] in the Broadway show ''[[Blackbirds of 1928]]''.<ref name="Williams">{{cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Iain Cameron |title=Underneath a Harlem Moon |date=September 15, 2002 |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0-8264-5893-9}}</ref>

Biographer Barry Singer conjectured that this song was written by Waller and lyricist [[Andy Razaf]] and provided a description of the sale given by Waller to the ''[[New York Post]]'' in 1929—he sold the song for $500 to a white songwriter for use in a financially successful show (consistent with [[Jimmy McHugh]]'s contributions to ''Harry Delmar's Revels'', 1927, and then to ''[[Blackbirds of 1928]]'').<ref name="Tyle" /> He noted that early handwritten manuscripts in the Dana Library Institute of Jazz Studies of "Spreadin' Rhythm Around" (Jimmy McHugh 1935) are in Waller's hand.<ref name="Tyle" /><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XfzZcCcgk9QC&pg=PR5 |title= Annual Review of Jazz Studies 7: 1994–1995 |editor1-first= Edward |editor1-last=Berger |editor2-first= Henry |editor-last2=Martin |editor3-first= David |editor3-last=Cayer |editor4-first= Dan |editor4-last=Morgenstern |editor5-first= Lewis |editor5-last=Porter| publisher= Scarecrow Press |date=1996 |isbn= 9780810831223 |access-date=June 27, 2014}}</ref> Jazz historian Paul S.

The anonymous sleeve notes on the 1960 [[RCA Victor]] album ''Handful of Keys'' state that Waller copyrighted over 400 songs, many of them co-written with his closest collaborator, [[Andy Razaf]]. Razaf described his partner as "the soul of melody...a man who made the piano sing...both big in body and in mind... known for his generosity... a bubbling bundle of joy". In the same notes are comments by clarinetist [[Gene Sedric]], who recorded with Waller in the 1930s. "Fats was the most relaxed man I ever saw in a studio, and so he made everybody else relaxed. After a balance had been taken, we'd just need one take to make a side, unless it was a kind of difficult number."

Waller played with [[Nathaniel Shilkret]], [[Gene Austin]], [[Erskine Tate]], [[Fletcher Henderson]], [[McKinney's Cotton Pickers]], and [[Adelaide Hall]].

On one occasion his playing seemed to have put him at risk of injury. Waller was kidnapped in Chicago while leaving a performance in 1926. Four men bundled him into a car and took him to the Hawthorne Inn, owned by [[Al Capone]]. Waller was ordered inside the building and found a party taking place. With a gun to his back he was pushed towards a piano and told to play. A terrified Waller realized he was the "surprise guest" at Capone's birthday party and was relieved that the kidnappers had no intention of killing him.<ref>Waller-Calabrese, pp. 62–63.</ref>

In 1926, Waller began his recording association with the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]]/[[RCA Victor]], his principal record company for the rest of his life, with the organ solos "[[St. Louis Blues (song)|St. Louis Blues]]" and his composition "Lenox Avenue Blues". Although he recorded with several groups, including Morris's Hot Babes (1927), Fats Waller's Buddies (1929) (one of the earliest multiracial groups to record), and McKinney's Cotton Pickers (1929), his most important contribution to the Harlem stride piano tradition was a series of solo recordings of his compositions: "Handful of Keys", "Smashing Thirds", "Numb Fumblin'", and "Valentine Stomp" (1929). After sessions with [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]] (1931), [[Jack Teagarden]] (1931) and [[Billy Banks (singer)|Billy Banks]]' Rhythmakers (1932), he began in May 1934 the voluminous series of recordings with a small band known as Fats Waller and his Rhythm. This six-piece group usually included [[Herman Autrey]] (sometimes replaced by [[Bill Coleman]] or [[John "Bugs" Hamilton]]), [[Gene Sedric]] or [[Rudy Powell]], and [[Al Casey (jazz guitarist)|Al Casey]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://syncopatedtimes.com/fats-waller-profiles-in-jazz/|title=Fats Waller: Profiles in Jazz|last=Yanow|first=Scott|newspaper=Syncopatedtimes.com|access-date=2020-05-21}}

Waller wrote "Squeeze Me" (1919), "Keepin' Out of Mischief Now", "[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]" (1929), "Blue Turning Grey Over You", "I've Got a Feeling I'm Falling" (1929), "[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]" (1929) and "[[Jitterbug Waltz]]" (1942). He composed stride piano display pieces such as "Handful of Keys", "Valentine Stomp" and "[[Viper's Drag]]".

He enjoyed success touring the United Kingdom and Ireland in the 1930s, appearing on one of the first [[BBC]] television broadcasts on September 30, 1938.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rutgers.edu/ijs/fw/people2c.htm|title=Fats Waller in Europe: London|first=Edwin|last=Vitery|website=www.rutgers.edu}}</ref> While in Britain, Waller also recorded a number of songs for [[EMI]] on their [[Theatre organ|Compton Theatre organ]] located in their [[Abbey Road Studios]] in [[St John's Wood]]. He appeared in several feature films and short subject films, most notably ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'' in 1943, which was released July 21, just months before his death. For the hit Broadway show ''[[Hot Chocolates]]'', he and Razaf wrote "[[(What Did I Do to Be So) Black and Blue]]" (1929), which became a hit for [[Ethel Waters]] and [[Louis Armstrong]].

Waller performed [[Bach]] organ pieces for small groups on occasion. He influenced many pre-[[bebop]] jazz pianists; [[Count Basie]] and [[Erroll Garner]] have both revived his hit songs. In addition to his playing, Waller was known for his many humorous quips during his performances.

Between 1926 and the end of 1927, Waller recorded a series of pipe organ solo records. These represent the first time syncopated jazz compositions were performed on a full-sized church organ. In April 1927, Waller played organ at the Vendome in Chicago for movies alongside Louis Armstrong, where his organ-playing was praised for "witty cueing" and "eccentric stop coupling."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brothers|first=Thomas|title=Louis Armstrong: Master of Modernism|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|year=2014|isbn=978-0-393-06582-4|location=New York, NY|pages=184}}</ref>

Waller's [[Victor Talking Machine Company|Victor]] recording of "A Little Bit Independent", written by [[Joe Burke (composer)|Joe Burke]] and [[Edgar Leslie]], was No. 1 on [[List of Your Hit Parade number-one songs|Your Hit Parade]] for two weeks in 1935. He also charted with "Whose Honey Are You?", "Lulu's Back in Town", "Sweet and Low", "Truckin'", "Rhythm and Romance", "Sing an Old Fashioned Song to a Young Sophisticated Lady", "West Wind", "All My Life", "It's a Sin to Tell a Lie", "Let's Sing Again", "Cross Patch", "You're Not the Kind", "Bye Bye Baby", "You're Laughing at Me", "I Love to Whistle", "Good for Nothing", "Two Sleepy People", and "Little Curly Hair in a Highchair".<ref>{{cite book |last=Fragias |first=Leonidas |author-link= |date=2017 |title=Your Hit Parade Charts: 1935-1940 |url=https://archive.org/details/YourHitParadeCharts19351940/page/n5/mode/2up |location= |publisher=Arts & Charts |page= |isbn=}}</ref>

=== Broadway Musicals ===

Later in Waller's career, he had the distinction of becoming the first African-American songwriter to compose a hit Broadway musical that was seen by a mostly white audience. Broadway producer [[Richard Kollmar]]'s hiring of Waller to create the 1943 musical ''Early to Bed'' was recalled in a 2016 essay about Waller by [[John McWhorter]], an American academic and linguist who is Associate Professor of English and Comparative Literature at [[Columbia University]].<blockquote>Even as late as 1943, the idea of a black composer writing the score for a standard-issue white show was unheard of. When Broadway performer and producer Richard Kollmar began planning ''Early to Bed'', his original idea was for Waller to perform in it as a comic character, not to write the music. Waller was, after all, as much a comedian as a musician. Comedy rarely dates well, but almost 80 years later, his comments and timing during "Your Feet's Too Big" are as funny as anything on Comedy Central, and he nearly walks away with the movie ''Stormy Weather'' with just one musical scene and a bit of mugging later on, despite the competition of Bill "Bojangles" Robinson, Lena Horne, and the Nicholas Brothers.

Kollmar's original choice for composer [of ''Early to Bed''] was Ferde Grofé, best known as the orchestrator of George Gershwin's "Rhapsody in Blue," whose signature compositions were portentous concert suites. But Grofé withdrew, and it is to Kollmar's credit that he realized that he had a top-rate pop-song composer available in Waller. Waller's double duty as composer and performer was short-lived. During a cash crisis and in an advanced state of intoxication, Waller threatened to leave the production unless Kollmar bought the rights to his Early to Bed music for $1,000. (This was typical of Waller, who often sold melodies for quick cash when in his cups. The evidence suggests, for example, that the standards "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" and "On the Sunny Side of the Street" were Waller tunes.) Waller came to his senses the next day, but Kollmar decided that his drinking habits made him too risky a proposition for eight performances a week. From then on, Waller was the show's composer only, with lyrics by George Marion, whose best-remembered work today is the script for the Astaire-Rogers film ''The Gay Divorcée''.<ref name="McWhorter">{{cite web |last1=McWhorter |first1=John |title=The Fats Waller You've Never Heard |url=https://www.city-journal.org/html/fats-waller-youve-never-heard-14795.html |website=City Journal |access-date=27 April 2020 |date=14 October 2016}}</ref></blockquote>

Six months after the premiere of ''Early to Bed'', it was still playing in a Broadway theater; at that point newspapers reported Waller's premature death.

==Personal life==
Waller married Edith Hatchett in 1920, with whom he had his first son, Thomas Waller Jr. in 1921. In 1923 Hatchett divorced Waller.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqGuCwAAQBAJ&q=%22Stormy+weather%22+%22fats+waller%22&pg=PR6|title=Stride: The Music of Fats Waller|first=Paul S.|last=Machlin|date=October 28, 1985|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349085675|access-date=June 7, 2019|via=Google Books}}</ref> Waller married Anita Rutherford in 1926.<ref>Waller-Calabrese, 1977, p. 64</ref> Together, they had a son, Maurice Thomas Waller, born on September 10, 1927.<ref>Waller-Calabrese, 1977, p. 70</ref> In 1928 Waller and Rutherford had their second son, Ronald Waller.<ref name="auto"/>

In 1938, Waller was one of the first African Americans to purchase a home in the Addisleigh Park section of [[St. Albans, Queens]], a New York City community with racially restrictive covenants. After his purchase, and litigation in the New York State courts, many prosperous African Americans followed, including many jazz artists, such as [[Count Basie]], [[Lena Horne]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], and [[Milt Hinton]].<ref>[http://prrac.org/newsletters/janfebmar2017.pdf "This Green and Pleasant Land"] by Bryan Greene, in Poverty and Race, page 3.</ref>

==Death and descendants==
Waller contracted [[pneumonia]] and died on December 15, 1943, while traveling aboard the famous cross-country Los Angeles–Chicago train the ''[[Super Chief]]'' near [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. His final recording session was with an interracial group in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], that included white trumpeter Don Hirleman. Waller was returning to New York City from Los Angeles, after the smash success of ''[[Stormy Weather (1943 film)|Stormy Weather]]'', and a successful engagement at the Zanzibar Room in [[Santa Monica, California]], during which he had fallen ill.<ref name= Stride-PSM>{{cite book| last= Machlin| first= Paul S.| title= Stride: The Music of Fats Waller| publisher= Springer| year= 1985| isbn= 9781349085675| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=QqGuCwAAQBAJ&q=zanzibar| via= Google Books}}</ref>{{rp|6}} More than 4,200 people were estimated to have attended his funeral at [[Abyssinian Baptist Church]] in [[Harlem]],<ref name= Stride-PSM />{{rp|7}} which prompted [[Adam Clayton Powell Jr.]], who delivered the eulogy, to say that Fats Waller "always played to a packed house."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/waller-fats-thomas-wright |title=Waller, Fats (Thomas Wright) | website= Jazz.com |access-date=June 27, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406062100/http://www.jazz.com/encyclopedia/waller-fats-thomas-wright |archive-date=April 6, 2009 }}</ref> Afterwards, he was cremated and his ashes were scattered over Harlem from an airplane piloted by an unidentified African American [[World War I]] aviator.<ref name=bolists>{{cite book|title=The Book of Lists 3| year= 1984| publisher= Corgi| page= 425| isbn=0-552-12371-4}} From "Gone with the wind, sort of: ashes of 19 famous people – and 1 dog."</ref>

==Revival and awards==
A [[Broadway musical]] showcasing Waller tunes entitled ''[[Ain't Misbehavin' (musical)|Ain't Misbehavin']]'' was produced in 1978 and featured Nell Carter, Andre de Shields, Armelia McQueen, Ken Page, and Charlaine Woodard. (The show and [[Nell Carter]] won [[Tony Award]]s.) The show opened at the [[Longacre Theatre]] and ran for more than 1600 performances. It was revived on Broadway in 1988 at the [[Ambassador Theatre (New York City)|Ambassador Theatre]] with the original Broadway Cast. Performed by five African-American actors, the show included such songs as "[[Honeysuckle Rose (song)|Honeysuckle Rose]]", "This Joint Is Jumpin'", and "[[Ain't Misbehavin' (song)|Ain't Misbehavin']]".

Probably the most talented pianist to keep the music of "Fats" Waller alive in the years after his death was [[Ralph Sutton]], who focused his career on playing stride piano. Sutton was a great admirer of Waller, saying "I've never heard a piano man swing any better than Fats – or swing a band better than he could. I never get tired of him. Fats has been with me from the first, and he'll be with me as long as I live."<ref>Schacter, James D. ''Piano Man: The Story of Ralph Sutton,'' p. 12, Jaynar Press, Chicago, IL.</ref>

Actor and band leader [[Conrad Janis]] also did a lot to keep the stride piano music of "Fats" Waller and [[James P. Johnson]] alive. In 1949, as an 18-year-old, Janis put together a band of aging jazz greats, consisting of James P.
