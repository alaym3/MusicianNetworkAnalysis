==Controversy==
In March 2014, Mozzy released the track "I'm Just Bein Honest" which sparked a feud with local rapper Lavish D. However, there had been an ongoing feud, which started in Meadowview and G Parkway in Sacramento, that put Guttah Team and Starz against Oak Park gangs like Fab and Stunna Gang.<ref name="beef">{{cite web|url=https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/sacramento-struggles-to-understand-its/content?oid=13183154|title=Sacramento News & Review - Sacramento struggles to understand its 'hybrid' gang problem as social media sparks local beefs - News - Local Stories - April 10, 2014|work=Sacramento News & Review|date=April 9, 2014|access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> This started with an ambush by Lavish D's "Starzup" gang on March 15 on an associate of Mozzy's from Oak Park at the [[Arden Fair Mall]] in Sacramento.<ref name="beef"/> Eight shootings followed, which the Sacramento Police department found to be linked by the original incident between the two gangs.<ref name="beef"/>

==Legal issues==
Between 2005 and 2008, Mozzy was arrested three times by the Sacramento Police for possession crimes, including illegal possession of a firearm and evading police. He was arrested again in 2014 and served a sentence in [[San Quentin State Prison]],<ref name="sacbee" /> during which his brother and colleague E Mozzy released the album ''Free Mozzy''. After his release, Mozzy decided to focus solely on his music, releasing four solo albums in 2015.<ref name="complex" /> Despite receiving offers to perform across the nation and worldwide, Mozzy was unable to leave the state of California until 2017 due to being on probation.<ref name="sacbee" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.passionweiss.com/2017/01/17/mozzy-interview/|title="Sacramento is Where I Call Home": An Interview with Mozzy|date=17 January 2017|website=Passionweiss.com|access-date=14 November 2018}}</ref>
