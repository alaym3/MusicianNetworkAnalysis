In March 2010, Royce released his [[Prince Royce (album)|eponymous debut studio album]], which generated two commercially successful singles, "[[Stand by Me (Ben E.

On April 10, 2012, Royce released his second studio album, ''[[Phase II (album)|Phase II]]'', which reached number-one on both the US Latin Albums and Tropical Albums charts. The album featured the singles "[[Las Cosas Pequeñas]]" and "[[Incondicional]]" and was nominated for the [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Tropical Fusion Album]].

His third studio album, ''[[Soy el Mismo (Prince Royce album)|Soy el Mismo]]'', was released on October 8, 2013, preceded by the single "[[Darte un Beso]]".
