'''Glen Hansard''' (born 21 April 1970)<ref name="IMDbBIO1">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0360598/bio|title=Glen Hansard |year=2010|work=IMDb profile|publisher=IMDb|access-date=5 May 2010}}</ref> is an Irish songwriter, actor, vocalist and guitarist for the Irish group [[The Frames]], and one half of [[folk rock]] duo [[The Swell Season]]. He is known for his acting, having appeared in the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-winning film ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]'', as well as starring in the film ''[[Once (film)|Once]]'', which earned him a number of major awards, including the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] for "[[Falling Slowly]]", with co-writer and co-star [[Markéta Irglová]].

==Career==
Hansard quit school<!-- what school? --> at age 13 to begin [[busking]] on local Dublin streets.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Divola|first=Barry|title='Once' in a Lifetime|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20053426,00.html|magazine=EW.com|date=29 August 2007|access-date=24 August 2011}}</ref> He formed his own band [[The Frames]] in 1990, and the group have been gigging regularly in Ireland since. Hansard came to international attention as guitar player Outspan Foster in the 1991 [[Alan Parker]] film ''[[The Commitments (film)|The Commitments]]''. He has often stated that he regretted taking the role because he felt it distracted him from his music career. In 2003, he presented the television programme ''[[Other Voices: Songs from a Room]]'', which showcased Irish music talent on [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]].<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2003-02-20|title=New Irish music series hits N2|url=https://www.rte.ie/entertainment/2003/0220/398742-othervoices/|language=en}}</ref>

On 22 April 2006, he released his first album without The Frames, ''[[The Swell Season (album)|The Swell Season]]'', on [[Overcoat Recordings]] in collaboration with Czech singer and multi-instrumentalist [[Markéta Irglová]], [[Marja Tuhkanen]] from [[Finland]] on violin and [[viola]], and [[Bertrand Galen]] from France on cello.  Hansard also spent part of 2006 in front of the cameras for the music-infused Irish film ''[[Once (film)|Once]]'', in which Hansard plays a Dublin busker, and Irglová an immigrant street vendor. The film had its United States premiere at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2007 and received the Festival's World Cinema Audience Award. During the promotional tour, he and Irglová began dating.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/fashion/24nite.html|title=Life imitating art|author=Jamie Diamond|newspaper=The New York Times|date=24 February 2008|access-date=24 February 2008}}</ref> Said Hansard about his relationship with Irglova: "I had been falling in love with her for a long time, but I kept telling myself she's just a kid".<ref>{{cite news|last=Spines|first=Christine|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20042740,00.html|title='Once' a Hero|publisher=Ew.com|date=22 June 2007|access-date=12 September 2009}}</ref>

Hansard had recorded a version of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[You Ain't Goin' Nowhere]]" for the film ''[[I'm Not There]]'' in 2007. In 2009, Hansard said that he and Irglova were no longer romantically linked, and that they are now "good friends".<ref>{{cite news|author=Master of excellence|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/falling-slowly-out-of-love-1614444.html|title=falling slowly ... out of love|publisher=Independent.ie|date=26 January 2009|access-date=12 September 2009}}</ref>

Aside from his projects with The Frames and Irglová, Hansard also took part as a member of the band on the 2006 [[Oxfam]] charity album, ''[[The Cake Sale]]''. Hansard has recorded several [[Cover version|cover songs]], both alone and with band member [[Colm Mac Con Iomaire]], for the [[Today FM]] discs ''Even Better than the Real Thing''. Songs that he has recorded include [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "[[Cry Me a River (Justin Timberlake song)|Cry Me a River]]" on ''[[Even Better than the Real Thing Vol. 1]]'' and [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Everytime]]" on ''[[Even Better than the Real Thing Vol. 2|Vol. 2]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

He voiced a role on an episode ("[[In the Name of the Grandfather]]") on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' as an Irish busker.<ref>{{Citation|last=Sosa|first=Ralph|title=In the Name of the Grandfather|date=2009-03-17|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291159/|type=Animation, Comedy|others=Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith|publisher=Gracie Films,  20th Century Fox Television|access-date=2021-01-18|last2=Anderson|first2=Mike B.}}</ref> A new album of original songs recorded as [[The Swell Season]] with [[Markéta Irglová]] and entitled ''[[Strict Joy]]'' was released on 27 October 2009 on the [[Anti- (record label)|ANTI-]] record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2009/07/10/the-swell-season-shares-a-bit-of-strict-joy|publisher=consequenceofsound.net|title=The Swell Season shares a bit of Strict Joy|author=Young, Alex|date=10 July 2009|access-date=25 July 2009}}</ref>

In the summer of 2011, he joined [[Eddie Vedder]] on his American solo tour in support of Vedder's solo album, ''Ukulele Songs''. He played a solo concert at the opening of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]'s Guitar Heroes exhibit in New York City in May 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/events/programs/spectrum/2011/glen-hansard|title=Glen Hansard and Guitar Heroes|date=May 2011|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=12 December 2011}}</ref> and on [[Cape Cod]] at the Cape Cinema on 17 June.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.capecodtoday.com/calendar-2011-06-17-event-19349.htm |title=An Evening with Glen Hansard |date=17 June 2011 |publisher=Cape Cod Today |access-date=12 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120724101028/http://www.capecodtoday.com/calendar-2011-06-17-event-19349.htm |archive-date=24 July 2012 }}</ref>

In September 2011, he played at [[Pearl Jam]]'s 20th Anniversary Festival PJ20 at the Alpine Valley Theatre outside of [[East Troy, Wisconsin]]. Hansard plays several guitars, including a very recognisable battered Takamine NP15 acoustic guitar (even sporting a large hole), which he calls "The Horse".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Horse |url=http://www.takamine.com/hwg/guitar/glen_hansard |publisher=Takamine Guitars |access-date=24 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726033359/http://www.takamine.com/hwg/guitar/glen_hansard |archive-date=26 July 2012 }}</ref>

This solo album was later revealed to be titled ''[[Rhythm and Repose]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/folkpopmusic/posts/389864471034926|title=Folk Pop Music - Glen Hansard Announces Solo Debut, Rhythm...|publisher=Facebook|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref>

''[[American Songwriter]]'' included Hansard's "Love Don't Leave Me Waiting" on its The Muse July Sampler.<ref>{{cite web|title=Free Download: The Muse July Sampler|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/06/free-download-the-muse-july-sampler/|work=Free Download: The Muse July Sampler|publisher=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=27 June 2012}}</ref> Another song of his featured in a film soundtrack is ''This Gift'', which appears in ''[[The Odd Life of Timothy Green]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012) - IMDb|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1462769/soundtrack|access-date=2021-01-18}}</ref>

Hansard sang the song "Take the Heartland" on the [[The Hunger Games: Songs from District 12 and Beyond|soundtrack]] for the 2012 film ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]''. Another song he wrote, "Come Away to the Water", is featured on the soundtrack, but is covered by [[Maroon 5]] and [[Rozzi Crane]]. Hansard can be found singing "Come Away to the Water" on the deluxe edition of his first solo album ''Rhythm and Repose''. He guest-starred in an episode of the TV series, ''[[Parenthood (2010 TV series)|Parenthood]]'', playing himself. In the episode, "Trouble in Candyland", he performed "High Hope", a single from his solo debut album ''Rhythm and Repose''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/glen-hansard-will-guest-star-on-parenthood-tonight,89473|title=Glen Hansard to guest star on Parenthood tonight|newspaper=The A.V.

==Influences==
Hansard has remarked about his musical influences: "In my house, when I was a kid, there was the holy trinity, which was [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Van Morrison]], and [[Bob Dylan]] with Bob sitting centre."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/dylan-support-slot-a-dream-come-true/2007/08/15/1186857582503.html|title=Dylan support slot a dream come true|newspaper=Smh.com.au|date=15 July 2007|access-date=12 September 2009}}</ref> Hansard and [[The Frames]] toured as the support act for Bob Dylan in Australia and [[New Zealand]] in August 2007 and Hansard often performs Van Morrison's songs in concert. Two such songs include "[[Into the Mystic]]", and "[[And the Healing Has Begun]]" which were included on the collector's edition of the soundtrack for the film ''Once''.

Hansard is a devotee of [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Krishna]] and performed for the 80th birthday of [[Swami Prabhupada]] in London, staying at a manor donated to the Hare Krishna movement by [[The Beatles]]' [[George Harrison]], who was a Hare Krishna devotee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Once-star-becomes-a-Hare-Krishna-.html#ixzz2Xkumh367|title="Once" star becomes a Hare Krishna|publisher=IrishCentral.com|access-date=24 October 2015}}</ref> In July 2013, he sang with Bruce Springsteen at Nowlan Park, [[Kilkenny]], Ireland.
