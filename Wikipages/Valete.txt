==Life & music career==
Valete was born in [[Lisbon]], where he was raised in the Benfica neighborhood. He traveled to Arroja, returned to [[Benfica (Lisbon)|Benfica]], then moved to [[Amadora]] and finally settled in [[Damaia]]. From a young age he developed strong politic opinions, influenced by his [[Philosophy]] teacher at school. During his youth he maintained relations with the JCP ([[Portuguese Communist Youth]]) and the PCP ([[Portuguese Communist Party]]). However, in the same interview he admitted that despite being a party in which he identifies himself ideologically, he has issues its structure and social agendas. Thus, he prefers to embrace the [[Bloco de Esquerda]] (Left Block), because it's closer to his political references.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ruadebaixo.com/valete.html}}</ref> He began listening to [[Rap music|rap]] music in 1991, later encountering such artists like [[Nas]], Krs-one and [[Racionais MC's]].<ref name="Magic HipHop">[http://hip-hop-inter.blogspot.com/2006/07/biografia-do-mc-valete.html M@giC-HiPhOp: Biografia do MC "Valete"], hip-hop-inter.blogspot.com; accessed 31 July 2018.</ref>

His career began in 1997 with [[Adamastor]], when they created a group called Canal 115, and later getting signed by Horizontal Records. During that same year, and only sixteen years old, he started recording mix-tapes launched by [[DJ]]s like Bomberjack and Cruzfader. He continued with Canal 115 for 2 more years constantly performing in his country, but then decided to dedicate himself to his studies, getting a degree in [[Economics]] at the Lisbon School of Economics & Management (ISEG).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2002 he returned with his [[album]] [[Educação Visual]], launched independently and rejecting collaborations. Valete, who before this album was known for being a [[Freestyle rap|freestyle]] or battle [[MC]], clearly showed his lyrical talent with elaborate rhymes, taking on anti-[[capitalism|capitalist]] overtones.<ref name="Magic HipHop"/> In the song "Anti-Herói", he defined himself as a "Trotskista belicista" (a bellicist Trotskist).{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

His second album [[Serviço Público]] was named as one of the best Portuguese hip hop albums of 2006 by the critics.<ref>Nuno Príncipe,  [http://cotonete.clix.pt/ouvir/entrevistas/body.aspx?id=1459&type=4] "Considerado pela crítica como um dos melhores discos nacionais de Hip Hop de 2006" ("Considered by the critics as one of the best national records of Hip Hop from 2006"), cotonete.clix.pt, 7 February 2007; accessed 23 June 2007.{{in lang|pt}}</ref> It was selected as the second best national album by the listeners of the Hip hop radio show ''Suburbano'' on [[Coimbra]]'s university radio, [[Radio Universidade de Coimbra|RUC]].<ref>[http://www.ruc.pt/noticia.php?id=2858] [[Radio Universidade de Coimbra]], 1 January 2007; accessed 23 June 2007.</ref>
