==History==
Initially formed in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Musician-Band/SoenMusic/about/|title=Soen|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=19 November 2020}}</ref> it was in May 2010 that the formation of Soen was announced. The original lineup consisted of former [[Opeth]] drummer [[Martin Lopez]], ex-[[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Sadus]] bassist [[Steve Di Giorgio]], Willowtree vocalist Joel Ekelöf and guitarist Kim Platbarzdis.<ref name="Blabbermouth">{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20130201081658/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=140806|url-status=dead|title=Former OPETH Drummer Joins Forces With SADUS Bassist - May 28, 2010|website=Blabbermouth.net|archivedate=19 November 2020}}</ref>
The group's first song, "Fraccions", was released on the band's official website in October 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20120714041023/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=147815|url-status=dead|title=SOEN Featuring MARTIN LOPEZ, STEVE DIGIORGIO: New Song Posted Online - Oct. 17, 2010|website=Blabbermouth.net|archivedate=19 November 2020}}</ref> Their first video, for the song "Savia", was posted on their Facebook page in February 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/|archiveurl=http://archive.today/20120713024452/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=169121|url-status=dead|title=Former OPETH Drummer's SOEN: 'Savia' Video Released - Feb. 2, 2012|website=Blabbermouth.net|archivedate=19 November 2020}}</ref> Their second video is a moody acoustic version of the song "Ideate". The band's third video is for the song "Delenda".

Drummer Martin Lopez has described Soen's music as "melodic, heavy, intricate and very different than everything else."<ref name="Blabbermouth"/> Their debut, ''Cognitive'', was released in February 2012 receiving positive critical reception.  The members' technical proficiency was praised the most, though many reviewers noted extreme stylistic similarities to the music of [[Tool (band)|Tool]].
Martin Lopez commented on the Tool similarity: "We are inspired by Tool but I consider them not only a band but a genre. Besides that, I really don't think there's anything to argue about, we make good music whoever it would remind you of. Some people tend to dislike rather than like and are looking for faults instead of seeing music for what it is, good or bad".<ref name="Martin interview">[http://www.grande-rock.com/interviews/soen Interview with Martin Lopez], by Grande-Rock.com retrieved on 15 March 2012.</ref>

''[[Cognitive (Soen Album)|Cognitive]]'' was released on Spinefarm records on 15 February 2012. The album was mixed by [[David Bottrill]] (Tool, Coheed and Cambria, [[Silverchair]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], etc.) and mastered by João Carvalho. There is also a bonus track on the Japanese edition called "Writhen".<ref name="Martin interview" /> ''[[Tellurian (Soen album)|Tellurian]]'' is the second album released by Soen on 4 November 2014. The album was produced by Platbarzdis, mixed again by [[David Bottrill]] and mastered at Bob Ludwig's Gateway setup in the U.S. by Adam Ayan. ''[[Lykaia (album)|Lykaia]]'' is the third album released by Soen on 3 February 2017. The whole album was recorded using analog equipment.

''[[Lotus (Soen album)|Lotus]]'' is the fourth album released by Soen on 1 February 2019.
