==Biography==
The four members of ATL - vocalists Tre, Will, L-Rock, and rapper Danger, came together after being chosen though an Atlanta-area talent search. Where previous R&B groups (112, Jagged Edge) had crossed over into hip-hop, by either featuring a guest rapper, or appearing on someone else's album, ATL was a self-contained R&B/hip-hop/fusion band. The quartet enlisted R. Kelly to produce their début single, "Calling All Girls," which was released in 2003.

Several of ATL's songs started leaking onto the internet in 2006. Whether they are from an upcoming album or previously recorded for "[[The ATL Project]]" is unknown. Songs include, "All Grown Men", "Throwback", "In The Club Tonight" featuring Jagged Edge, "Do It" featuring UK MC Doctor, "Foolin' Around", "L.O.V.E.", "Riding Dirty" and "What I'm Looking For". However, the songs were very outdated, as they were actually three years old at the time, even though they were then-recently released. ATL has indeed disbanded, but the members are working on individual projects, according to former member Lawrence "L-Rock" Gibbs IV.
It was announced in 2013 that ATL would be making a comeback for one night only in the summer. It is yet to be determined when the date will be for this reunion.<ref name=underthegun>{{cite web|title=REVIEW: All Time Low – Don’t Panic|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2012/10/08/review-all-time-low-dont-panic/|publisher=underthegunreview.net|accessdate=10 December 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104090208/http://www.underthegunreview.net/2012/10/08/review-all-time-low-dont-panic/|archivedate=4 November 2013}}</ref><ref name=top40>{{cite web|last=Lamb|first=Bill|title=All Time Low|url=http://top40.about.com/od/a/p/alltimelowprofile.htm|publisher=top40.about.com|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref><ref name=youtube>{{cite web|title=All Time Low - I Feel Like Dancin'|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTJkE8Ki3Gg|publisher=youtube.com|accessdate=10 December 2013}}</ref>
