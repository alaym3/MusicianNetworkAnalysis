'''Emanuel Herrera Batista''' (born 18 December 1990), known professionally as '''El Alfa El Jefe''', or simply as '''El Alfa''', is a Dominican rapper and singer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elcaribe.com.do/2018/08/24/gente/a-y-e/el-alfa-soy-una-persona-que-gusta-el-riesgo-del-exito/|title=El Alfa: "Soy una persona que me gusta el riesgo del éxito"|last=Jiménez|first=Karina|date=24 August 2018|work=El Caribe|access-date=3 November 2018|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Biografía de El Alfa El Jefe|url=https://www.buenamusica.com/el-alfa/biografia|access-date=14 February 2021|website=buenamusica.com|language=es}}</ref> Batista was born in [[Bajos de Haina]], [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristobal]]. He is known for his high-pitched, sensual voice and initial afro hairstyle which led him to popularity in the early 2010s through songs like "Tarzan", "Coche Bomba" and "Muevete Jevi". He went on to form good relationships with many artists from [[Puerto Rico]], such as [[Nicky Jam]], [[Farruko]], and [[Myke Towers]] amongst others. This resulted in one of the biggest collaborations in [[dembow]] history, led by El Alfa, when he released "Suave (Remix)" in December 2018 alongside [[Chencho Corleone]], [[Bryant Myers]], [[Miky Woodz]], [[Jon Z]] and [[Noriel]].

El Alfa's reach continued to grow in the coming years, where he collaborated with international stars like [[Cardi B]], [[J Balvin]], [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]], [[Tyga]] and [[Black Eyed Peas]]. "Singapur" surpassed the 200 million mark in February 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=El Alfa "El Jefe" – Singapur (El Androide) – YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCufThTuB3M&ab_channel=ElAlfaElJefeTV|access-date=14 February 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref>

With more than 18,000,000 monthly listeners to his music on [[Spotify]] and ranked #164 in the world,<ref>{{Cite web|title=El Alfa|url=https://open.spotify.com/artist/2oQX8QiMXOyuqbcZEFsZfm|access-date=14 February 2021|website=Spotify|language=en}}</ref> El Alfa is considered the leader of the Dominican dembow genre.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

== Career ==

=== 2008–2013: Career beginnings and ''Dembow Exitos'' ===
Batista became independent from his family at the age of 17 after a childhood where he dreamed of becoming a barber.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Montoya|first=Leydy|date=17 July 2020|title=El Alfa|url=https://historia-biografia.com/el-alfa/|access-date=14 February 2021|website=Historia y Biografía|language=es}}</ref>

Instead, once he became independent, his musical career started in 2008, when he went on to form a duo with Eddy Wilson, another Dominican [[Dembow]] artist looking to make his name on the scene. In their short stint together, they released street-style dembow songs such as "El Fogon"<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alfa y Eddy W – el fogon – YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssjFGGaGCPY&ab_channel=Puellosbrother|access-date=14 February 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref> and "Conmigo No".<ref>{{Cite web|title=El Alfa y Eddy Wilson – Con Migo no (Puello Ent) – YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpQDdNcpi2k&ab_channel=Welingtonss|access-date=14 February 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref> The duo broke up in 2009 as they opted to continue their careers as solo artists.

Batista's first release as a solo artist was "Coche Bomba"<ref>{{Cite web|title=El Alfa Coche Bomba Video Official (mp3alfa.com) – YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUoUEMrPMQE&ab_channel=MP3alfa|access-date=14 February 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref> in 2009, a song which made waves in the Dominican Urban scene at the time, cementing himself as an upcoming artist in the [[Dominican Republic]] known as El Alfa El Jefe. He followed the success of that with "Coco Mordan" in 2010, another song that showed the capabilities of his high-pitched voice with a hard-hitting beat. In 2011, he found relative success with two songs released in the final couple of months of the year, "No Wiri Wiri" and "Agarrate Que Te Solté". But the first time El Alfa truly entered the regional scene as an up-and-coming superstar was in 2012, when he released "Cacao", "Con To' Lo' Cascabeles" and "Muevete Jevi". The latter would continue to be one of his most popular songs, as it amassed more than 3 million streams on Spotify in recent years. He then managed to group those songs onto ''Dembow Exitos'' in 2013, a 10-song album which was an example of what the El Alfa character represented: hard-hitting, fast beats coupled with his rare, high-pitched voice that was backed by the productions of Nico Clinico, Bubloy, El Kable and fellow Dominican artist [[Chimbala]].

El Alfa's popularity continued to rise when he released "Fuin Fuan" in April 2013, continuing his style of high-paced dembow with a touch of DJ Patio's productions. He managed to secure important collaborations in that year too, performing "Humo Excúsame (Remix)" with [[Musicologo the libro|Musicologo The Libro]] and "Tú Me Gusta Pila" with Puerto Rican artist [[Farruko]]. The latter collaboration would be an important one for years to come in the career of El Alfa El Jefe.

=== 2014–2016: Regional growth, national controversy and ''Dembow Exitos 2.0'' ===
The success of his music in the early 2010s launched him into regional stardom, as he began to record with the likes of [[Jowell & Randy]], [[Nicky Jam]], [[Tempo (rapper)|Tempo]] and [[Arcángel]] from [[Puerto Rico]]'s [[Reggaeton]] industry. His success on the local scene however was threatened by a number of rivals, most notably El Mayor Clasico, who he was embroiled in a fierce rivalry with. After both succeeded in controlling a large portion of the street dembow genre in 2014 and began to compete at parties and clubs, they battled against each other with diss tracks. In a twist to his usual humorous side, El Alfa sent out a strong message to the dembow community that he is here to stay when El Mayor was on the receiving end of "No Te Panike", a dembow style diss track that was aggressive yet catchy. El Mayor would reply with his own diss track "Ratrero" a week later, heating up the rivalry between them as the genre began to grow externally.

El Alfa, who had no intention of stopping at the point, went on to release his biggest track to date, "Tarzan". The song, which describes his sexual relations with a woman who 'screams like Tarzan', saw him quickly rise in popularity and catch the eye of some of Puerto Rico's biggest artists, namely [[Nicky Jam]]. Tarzan formed part of ''Dembow Exitos 2.0'', El Alfa's second album which mainly followed the same format as the first. Once again, the likes of Bubloy produced on the album alongside DJ Plano, but it was the exploits of Nico Clinico that really helped El Alfa shine and rise through the ranks.<ref>{{Cite web|date=7 February 2018|title=Te presentamos a Alfa: El jefe de movimiento urbano dominicano|url=https://heabbi.com/presentamos-a-alfa|access-date=16 February 2021|website=Heabbi.com|language=es}}</ref>

In 2015, after receiving criticism for insulting the founding fathers of the [[Dominican Republic]] in a music video, El Alfa was sentenced to 15 days of community service. The President of El Instituto Duartino, Cesar Romero called for the boycott and destruction of El Alfa's albums for having disrespected the founding fathers. Part of El Alfa's sentencing was to clean the Plaza de la Bandera and to sing the national anthem for two hours for fifteen consecutive days. Additionally, El Alfa was ordered to hand out educational pamphlets about the founding fathers at traffic lights in Santo Domingo.<ref>Ramírez, Dixa.

The biggest success of that year would be "Pal de Velitas" with Mark B, a song produced by [[Chael Produciendo]] that surpassed 20 million views on Youtube.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mark B ft El Alfa El Jefe – Pal de Velitas (Video Oficial) – YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f70-4PI03DQ&ab_channel=Alofokeradioshow|access-date=16 February 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref> This up-and-coming producer would continue to form a part of El Alfa's team for the coming years.

Chael produced two songs for El Alfa in 2016, "No Hay Forma" and "Segueta (Remix)" ft. [[Nicky Jam]]. Alongside him, El Alfa began to excel in a sub-genre of Dembow called "TrapBow", which is a mix between American trap and Dembow.<ref>{{Cite web|date=15 August 2018|title=Líderes, éxitos y el futuro del trapbow dominicano|url=https://heabbi.com/trapbow-dominicano|access-date=19 February 2021|website=Heabbi.com|language=es}}</ref> It first emerged in "Banda De Camion", one of El Alfa's most successful solo songs to date. El Alfa's first verse was made up of 24 bars, a level he wasn't accustomed to hitting. This song caught the eyes of fans across Latin America and would go on to open the doors for more potential collaborations between the Puerto Rican and Dominican urban music industries. He went on to record "Nadie Como Tú" with [[Nicky Jam]] and "Una Papi Que La Mima" with [[Tempo (rapper)|Tempo]] and [[Farruko]] before the end of the year. The duo of El Alfa and Chael had started to create a new level of success for urban Dominican artists, as El Alfa toured Europe<ref>{{Cite web|title=Exitoso primer fin de semana de "El Alfa" en su mas reciente gira por Europa!!! - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adc-TToAmxI&ab_channel=Alofokeradioshow|access-date=19 February 2021|website=youtube.com}}</ref> for the first time in 2016 after a promising 2015 in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=Nacimientodiciembre 18|first1=Información personalNombre CompletoEmanuel Herrera Batista|last2=Alfa|first2=1990Edad30 añosOcupación Rapero y compositor Apodo/PseudónimoEl|last3=Dembow|first3=El Alfa El Jefe NacionalidadDominicanoGéneros|last4=Urbano|last5=reggaeton|last6=trap|date=17 July 2020|title=El Alfa|url=https://historia-biografia.com/el-alfa/|access-date=19 February 2021|website=Historia y biografía de|language=es}}</ref>
