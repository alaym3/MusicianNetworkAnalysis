Tyson made his professional debut as an 18-year-old on March 6, 1985, in [[Albany, New York]]. He defeated Hector Mercedes via first-round TKO.<ref name="espn1" /> He had 15 bouts in his first year as a professional.

His win streak attracted media attention and Tyson was billed as the next great [[heavyweight]] champion.

Tyson's first nationally [[television|televised]] bout took place on February 16, 1986, at [[Houston Field House]] in [[Troy, New York]], against journeyman heavyweight [[Jesse Ferguson]], and was carried by [[ABC Sports]].

Retrieved March 11, 2007.</ref> During the sixth round, Ferguson began to hold and clinch Tyson in an apparent attempt to avoid further punishment. After admonishing Ferguson several times to obey his commands to box, the [[Referee (boxing)|referee]] finally stopped the fight near the middle of the sixth round. The fight was initially ruled a win for Tyson by [[Disqualification (boxing)|disqualification]] (DQ) of his opponent. The ruling was "adjusted" to a win by [[technical knockout]] (TKO) after Tyson's corner protested that a DQ win would end Tyson's string of knockout victories, and that a knockout would have been the inevitable result.

In July, after recording six more knockout victories, Tyson fought former world title challenger [[Marvis Frazier]] in [[Glens Falls, New York]], on another ABC Sports broadcast. Tyson won easily, charging at Frazier at the opening bell and hitting him with an uppercut that knocked Frazier unconscious thirty seconds into the fight.

On November 22, 1986, Tyson was given his first title fight against [[Trevor Berbick]] for the [[World Boxing Council]] (WBC) heavyweight championship.

===Undisputed champion===
{{See also|Mike Tyson vs. James Smith|Mike Tyson vs. Tony Tucker|Mike Tyson vs. Michael Spinks}}
Expectations for Tyson were extremely high, and he was the favorite to win the [[heavyweight unification series]], a tournament designed to establish an undisputed heavyweight champion. Tyson defended his title against [[James Smith (boxer)|James Smith]] on March 7, 1987, in Las Vegas, Nevada. He won by unanimous decision and added Smith's [[World Boxing Association]] (WBA) title to his existing belt.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "Tyson Unifies W.B.C.-W.B.A. Titles", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 5, Page 1, Column 4'', March 8, 1987.</ref> "Tyson-mania" in the media was becoming rampant.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bamonte |first=Bryan |date=June 10, 2005 |title=Bad man rising |url=http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/2005/di2005-06-10.pdf |newspaper=[[The Daily Iowan]] |pages=12, 9 |access-date=July 30, 2017 |archive-date=October 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024100324/http://dailyiowan.lib.uiowa.edu/DI/2005/di2005-06-10.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> He beat [[Pinklon Thomas]] in May by TKO in the sixth round.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "Tyson Retains Title On Knockout In Sixth", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 5, Page 1, Column 2'', May 31, 1987.</ref> On August 1 he took the [[International Boxing Federation]] (IBF) title from [[Tony Tucker]] in a twelve-round unanimous decision 119–111, 118–113, and 116–112.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "Boxing&nbsp;— Tyson Undisputed And Unanimous Titlist", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 1, Page 51, Column 1'', August 2, 1987.</ref> He became the first heavyweight to own all three major belts&nbsp;– WBA, WBC, and IBF&nbsp;– at the same time. Another fight, in October of that year, ended with a victory for Tyson over 1984 Olympic super heavyweight gold medalist [[Tyrell Biggs]] by TKO in the seventh round.<ref>Berger, Phil (1987), "Tyson Retains Title In 7 Rounds", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 1, Page 51, Column 1'', October 17, 1987.</ref>

During this time, Tyson came to the attention of gaming company [[Nintendo]]. After witnessing one of Tyson's fights, Nintendo of America president [[Minoru Arakawa]] was impressed by the fighter's "power and skill", prompting him to suggest Tyson be included in the upcoming [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] port of the ''[[Punch-Out!! (arcade game)|Punch Out!!]]'' arcade game. In 1987, Nintendo released ''[[Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!!]]'', which was well received and sold more than a million copies.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=221| title=Profile: Minoru Arakawa| publisher=N-Sider| access-date=October 11, 2011| archive-date=June 11, 2011| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611040601/http://www.n-sider.com/contentview.php?contentid=221| url-status=live}}</ref>

Tyson had three fights in 1988. He faced [[Larry Holmes]] on January 22, 1988, and defeated the legendary former champion by KO in the fourth round.<ref>Berger, Phil (1988), "Tyson Keeps Title With 3 Knockdowns in Fourth", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section 1, Page 47, Column 5'', January 23, 1988.</ref> This was the only knockout loss Holmes suffered in 75 professional bouts. In March, Tyson then fought contender [[Tony Tubbs]] in Tokyo, Japan, fitting in an easy second-round TKO victory amid promotional and marketing work.<ref>Shapiro, Michael. (1988), "Tubbs's Challenge Was Brief and Sad", ''[[The New York Times]], Sports Desk, Late City Final Edition, Section A, Page 29, Column 1'', March 22, 1988.</ref>

On June 27, 1988, Tyson faced [[Michael Spinks]]. Spinks, who had taken the heavyweight championship from [[Larry Holmes]] via fifteen-round decision in 1985, had not lost his title in the ring but was not recognized as champion by the major boxing organizations. Holmes had previously given up all but the IBF title, and that was eventually stripped from Spinks after he elected to fight Gerry Cooney (winning by TKO in the fifth round) rather than IBF Number 1 Contender Tony Tucker, as the Cooney fight provided him a larger purse. However, Spinks did become the lineal champion by beating Holmes and many (including [[The Ring (magazine)|''Ring'']] magazine) considered him to have a legitimate claim to being the true heavyweight champion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingscene.com/crowning-recognizing-lineal-champion-part-i--18453|title=Crowning and Recognizing A Lineal Champion|publisher=BoxingScene|author=Jake Donovan|access-date=November 20, 2016|archive-date=January 18, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118083551/http://www.boxingscene.com/crowning-recognizing-lineal-champion-part-i--18453|url-status=live}}</ref> The bout was, at the time, the richest fight in history and expectations were very high. Boxing pundits were predicting a titanic battle of styles, with Tyson's aggressive infighting conflicting with Spinks's skillful out-boxing and footwork. The fight ended after 91 seconds when Tyson knocked Spinks out in the first round; many consider this to be the pinnacle of Tyson's fame and boxing ability.<ref>Berger, Phil.

Tyson, who was the number one contender, faced number two contender [[Donovan Ruddock|Donovan "Razor" Ruddock]] on March 18, 1991, in Las Vegas. Ruddock was seen as the most dangerous heavyweight around and was thought of as one of the hardest punching heavyweights. Tyson and Ruddock went back and forth for most of the fight, until referee [[Richard Steele (referee)|Richard Steele]] controversially stopped the fight during the seventh round in favor of Tyson. This decision infuriated the fans in attendance, sparking a post-fight melee in the audience.

Partial corroboration of Washington's story came via testimony from Tyson's [[chauffeur]] who confirmed Desiree Washington's state of shock after the incident.

K-1 signed Tyson to a contract with the hopes of making a fight happen between the two, but Tyson's felony history made it impossible for him to obtain a visa to enter Japan, where the fight would have been most profitable. Alternative locations were discussed, but the fight ultimately failed to happen.<ref>[http://www.tysontalk.com/article48.html K-1 Reports Official Mike Tyson Fight] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111118123147/http://www.tysontalk.com/article48.html |date=November 18, 2011 }}.
