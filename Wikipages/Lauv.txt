==Early life==
Leff was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. He spent his early childhood in a suburb of [[Atlanta, Georgia]], before his family relocated to a suburb of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. He went to [[Radnor High School]].<ref name="time">{{cite news |last1=Bruner |first1=Raisa |title=Meet Lauv, the New Voice in Pop Making Hits Out of Heartbreak |url=http://time.com/5335106/lauv-interview/ |access-date=April 30, 2019 |newspaper=Time |date=August 17, 2018}}</ref> As a child, he was interested in music and took piano and viola lessons before learning how to play the guitar at the age of 11.<ref name=":0" /> Leff studied guitar, recording, sound design, production, voice, and songwriting with Jason Brook Zimmerman, co-owner and founder of the music lesson organization, Traveling Musician.<ref name="Traveling Musician">{{Cite web|url= https://travelingmusician.com/2019/11/01/zoe-spring-recital/|title=Student News|date=November 1, 2019|website=Traveling Musician|access-date=February 9, 2021}}</ref> He started writing songs in middle school, at around 14 years old.<ref name=":1"/> Many of his songs during this period focused on heartbreak and breakups, despite at the time, never having had a girlfriend.<ref name="time" /> During his time in high school, he played in several bands and studied jazz before moving on to electronic music.<ref name=":0" /> He was so "fully obsessed" in making music and playing shows that he had no interest to "drink, or do drugs, or anything".<ref name="Zack Sang Show">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZVvdoN57BI|title=Lauv Talks Drugs & The Internet, Depression and New Music|last=Zack Sang Show|date=May 3, 2019|website=YouTube|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref> He has said that his sister, Aiva would drive him and his friends on tour, where they often played "to zero people".<ref name="trib">{{cite news |last1=Stewart |first1=Allison |title=Jingle stuff, youthful pop stars, Sabrina Carpenter, Lauv and all that fame |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ott-sabrina-carpenter-lauv-jingle-ball-1207-story.html |access-date=April 30, 2019 |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=December 3, 2018}}</ref> His early musical influences were [[Owl City]] and [[Never Shout Never]]. He would listen to Owl City's "[[Maybe I'm Dreaming]]" and study the production style and the abstract lyrical themes that use "dreamy" and "whimsical" images to describe love. He also adopted the artist name, ''Somersault Sunday'', and published some songs and [[extended plays]] on his [[Myspace]] account.<ref name="Zack Sang Show"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/somersaultsunday|title=Somersault Sunday on Myspace|last=Somersault Sunday|website=Myspace|access-date=February 24, 2020}}</ref>

After graduating high school, Leff decided to pursue a behind-the-scenes role in music seeing that his career was not taking off. He chose to study [[music technology]] at [[New York University]]'s [[Steinhardt School]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1"/> While at university, he studied abroad in [[Prague]] and was a member of the [[Zeta Psi]] fraternity.<ref name="nyu">{{cite news |title=NYU's Own Lauv Hits Big With First Single, "The Other" |url=https://nyulocal.com/nyus-own-lauv-hits-big-with-first-single-the-other-a9b7a6579971 |access-date=April 30, 2019 |newspaper=NYU Local |date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> He spent two of his four years at NYU as a studio intern for [[Jungle City Studios]], where artists such as [[Jay-Z]], [[Justin Timberlake]], and [[Alicia Keys]] recorded.<ref name="time"/> During his junior year, he signed a publishing deal after the success of his song "The Other" but he decided to finish university and "enjoy it" having only a year left and because he was also feeling "fortunate enough to be able to go there".<ref name="Zack Sang Show"/>

==Career==
===2008–2012: Early years and ''Somersault Sunday''===
Leff began writing music at an early age. When he was 12, he started his first rock duo with his friend Mike Wagenheim, and by age 13, the two teens started a metal band. After starting to try and write music, Leff began experimenting with an acoustic guitar and some synth sounds. A few months later, he wrote his own solo acoustic song called ''Parting Ways''. Leff then formed his first solo music project, ''Somersault Sunday'', when he was 14 years old on April 28, 2008. He started it first "as a side project, just for fun," but continued it after receiving enthusiastic online response.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sonicbids.com/band/somersaultsunday/|title=Somersault Sunday on Sonicbids|website=Sonicbids|access-date=August 16, 2020}}</ref>

''Somersault Sunday'' is an electro-infused pop rock solo-project. Under the ''Somersault Sunday'' project, he was able to release three [[extended plays]] namely, ''Parting Ways EP'' (2009), ''Intermission - EP'' (2010), and ''Phone Calls & Weekends'' (2010). Trevor Dahl of [[Cheat Codes (DJs)|Cheat Codes]] (who was then making music under the moniker ''Plug In Stereo'') featured on his track "Wishful Thinking" from the ''Intermission'' [[extended play|EP]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/somersaultsunday/|title=Somersault Sunday on Myspace|website=Myspace|access-date=August 15, 2020}}</ref> The ''Phone Calls & Weekends'' EP, was produced by Kevin Gates, who also mixed and produced some of the songs of [[Never Shout Never]], [[The Ready Set]], and [[Cady Groves]]. He posted his songs on [[MySpace]] along with some song covers, and kept close contact with his fans through the platform. He had a band playing with him during live shows and concerts. Leff was known for his basement concerts in his early middle and high school years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reverbnation.com/somersaultsunday/|title=Somersault Sunday on ReverbNation|website=ReverbNation|access-date=August 15, 2020}}</ref>

===2014–2016: Beginnings and ''Lost in the Light''===
Leff focused on writing and producing for other artists during college, straying from his personal songwriting style. During his sophomore year, he stumbled upon an interview with [[Paul Simon]], in which Simon described his songwriting approach as a process of uncovering his innermost buried feelings. The interview helped Leff to get in touch with the way he used to write.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Han |first1=Alex |title=Review: LAUV discovers himself through his music |url=https://eagleeye.news/artsandleisure/review-lauv-discovers-himself-through-his-music/ |access-date=April 30, 2019 |publisher=Eagle Eye |date=March 18, 2018}}</ref> Afterwards, Leff adopted the stage name Lauv, [[Latvian language|Latvian]] for "lion" (lauva), as a nod to his mother's heritage. His first name, Ari, means "lion" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and his zodiac sign is Leo.<ref name="nyu"/><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-07-10-interview-lauv-reveals-the-touching-inspiration-behind-i-like-me-better/|title=INTERVIEW: LAUV Reveals The Touching Inspiration Behind 'I Like Me Better'|last=Mastrogiannis|first=Nicole|date=July 10, 2017|website=iHeartRadio|access-date=April 13, 2018}}</ref>

While getting over a break-up in fall of 2014, he co-wrote "The Other" with Michael Matosic.<ref name="time"/><ref name="nyu"/> Although he was focused on writing potential songs for other artists, he felt "The Other" worked better as his own song.
