'''Mark Morrison''' (born 3 May 1972) is a British [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer. His single, "[[Return of the Mack]]", became a No. 1 or [[Top 40|top 10]] [[hit record|hit]] in several European countries in 1996. The song peaked at No. 2 in the United States the following year.

== Early life and education==

Born in [[Hanover]], [[West Germany]], to [[Barbadian people|Bajan]] parents, Morrison grew up in [[Highfields, Leicester]], United Kingdom. He attended [[Soar Valley Academy]], before moving to [[Miami]], Florida. At the age of nineteen, he moved back to the UK.

== Career ==

Mark Morrison's first official recording was the 1993 vinyl release "Where Is Our Love", pressed on his own private Joe'Mel label.

In mid-1995, Morrison released his debut single, "Crazy", which became a Top-20 hit in the UK, and was a club favourite.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/309555/mark-morrison/biography |title=Mark Morrison Biography |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=11 June 2016}}</ref> The follow-up single, "Let's Get Down", also entered the Top 40. They were followed in the spring of 1996 by "Return of the Mack", which became a smash international hit, spending two weeks at the top of the [[UK Singles Chart]].

His debut album, also titled ''[[Return of the Mack (album)|Return of the Mack]]'', followed and became a multi-platinum success. It reached number four in the UK chart and sold 3 million albums worldwide. It spun off several more hit singles over the next year: "Crazy (Remix)", "Trippin'", "Horny", and "Moan & Groan" would all reach the UK Top 10, making him the first artist in British pop history to have five Top 10 hits from a debut album.

Although his career was going well, Morrison was constantly in trouble with the police. In 1997, he was imprisoned. The same year he received numerous nominations: four [[Brit Awards]] nominations, a [[Mercury Prize]] nomination, an [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] nomination, and five [[Music of Black Origin Awards]] (MOBO) nominations. "Return of the Mack" began to climb its way to No. 2 on the American [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], receiving platinum status. It stayed on the ''Billboard'' charts for a lengthy 40 weeks. Morrison had one minor US hit, 1997's "Moan & Groan," which went to number 76.

Morrison performed at the 1997 Brit Awards. The performance influenced [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] and Morrison to release ''[[Only God Can Judge Me (Morrison album)|Only God Can Judge Me]]'', a nine-track [[Extended play|EP]] which contains live performances, interviews, prayers, and three full-length songs including "Who's the Mack!" which reached No. 13 in the UK.
