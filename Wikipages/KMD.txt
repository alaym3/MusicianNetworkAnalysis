'''KMD''' (''Kausing Much Damage'', or ''A positive Kause in a Much Damaged society'') was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] trio active in the early 1990s. The core of the group was composed of brothers [[Zev Love X|Daniel "Zev Love X"]] Dumile and [[DJ Subroc|Dingilizwe "DJ Subroc"]] Dumile. The group is best known for launching the career of Zev Love X, who later became [[MF DOOM]]. The group's original third member, Rodan, left before the group signed with [[Elektra Records]]; he was replaced with Onyx the Birthstone Kid. The group disbanded in 1993 after the sudden death of DJ Subroc and the subsequent decision by Elektra to drop the group from their label.  

KMD released two studio albums, ''[[Mr. Hood]]'' (1991) and ''[[Black Bastards]]'', with the latter originally recorded in 1993 but not officially released until 2000 due to its cancellation by Elektra. Zev Love X attempted to revive the KMD name in the 2010s, releasing a new song and announcing a comeback album in 2017, but no further updates or recordings surfaced before his death in October 2020.

==History==
Zev Love X, DJ Subroc, and Rodan formed KMD in [[Long Beach, New York]], in 1988.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|pages=185/6}}</ref> The three were Black Muslims active in the [[Nuwaubian Nation]]. KMD began as a [[crew|graffiti crew]]; they also practiced [[breakdance]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GnsVf5WjFA|title=Lecture: DOOM (Madrid 2011)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=January 23, 2020}}</ref>

Onyx the Birthstone Kid soon replaced Rodan, who left the group in order to finish high school. [[MC Serch]], a native of nearby [[Far Rockaway, Queens|Far Rockaway]], met the group at community functions and recruited them for a guest spot on "The Gas Face," a single off [[3rd Bass]]' ''[[The Cactus Album]]''. The guest appearance caught the attention of [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive [[Dante Ross]], who signed KMD to [[Elektra Records]].

KMD released their debut album ''[[Mr. Hood]]'' in 1991.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Its songs focus on racism and black empowerment in a comical manner. Subroc heavily sampled old children's television shows and recordings, including drops of ''[[Sesame Street]]'' character [[Bert (Sesame Street)|Bert]] on the singles "Who Me?" and "Humrush." Skits featuring KMD interacting with "Mr. Hood" (a series of samples from a language instruction tape) tie the album together. Stimulated Dummies co-produced ''Mr. Hood''; the album also featured fellow [[Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percenters]], [[Brand Nubian]] appearing on "Nitty Gritty."

The group recorded their follow up, ''[[Black Bastards]]'', in 1993.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The album was a departure from their lighthearted previous release with songs celebrating sex ("Plumskinnz"), drugs ("Smokin' That S*#%", "Contact Blitt", "Suspended Animation"), and drinking ("Sweet Premium Wine"). Onyx left the group during the recording sessions. His verse was removed from "Plumskinzz" (the B-side to the "Nitty Gritty" single off ''Mr. Hood''), which was included on ''Black Bastards'' as two separate tracks, "Plumskinzz.(Loose Hoe, God & Cupid)" (Zev Love X's verse) and "Plumskinzz.(Oh No I Don't Believe It!)" (Subroc's verse). Zev Love X created the cover art, a [[Sambo (ethnic slur)|Sambo]] [[caricature]] being hanged in a game of [[Hangman (game)|hangman]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/>

Shortly before finishing ''Black Bastards'', Subroc was killed<ref>{{Cite web|title=Subroc Of KMD' Death In '94-Cage On The Last Night He Spent With Him - Rap Worlds Forums|url=http://www.rapworlds.com/forums/showthread.php?t=93736|access-date=2021-03-09|website=Rapworlds.com}}</ref> while attempting to cross the 878 Nassau Expressway on April 23, 1993. Zev Love X completed the album alone over the course of the next months and advance copies were finally sent out in early 1994.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> "What a Nigga Know?" was released as the first single in April that same year and ''Black Bastards'' was announced to be released on May 3, 1994.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Coleman|first=Brian|date=2016-04-10|title=Check The Technique: The Birth of MF Doom|url=https://medium.com/cuepoint/check-the-technique-kmds-black-bastards-and-the-birth-of-mf-doom-1849f4c0a6f4|access-date=2021-01-04|website=Medium|language=en}}</ref> Soon afterwards Elektra Records unexpectedly cancelled the album and dropped KMD.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The album's title and cover art proved too controversial for Elektra's management,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> who instructed [[Dante Ross]] to give Zev Love X the ''Black Bastards'' master tapes and $20,000 as incentive to leave the label. The album was heavily bootlegged until it was officially released on ReadyRock Records in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Quinlan |first1=Thomas |title=KMD Black Bastards |url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/kmd-black_bastards |website=[[Exclaim!]] |access-date=19 March 2021 |date=1 May 2000}}</ref> Zev Love X dropped out of the New York hip hop scene until 1997, when he reemerged as [[MF Doom]].

On August 16, 2017, MF Doom premiered the first new KMD track in ten years, "True Lightyears", on [[NPR Music]]. It was the first single from KMD's still-unreleased comeback album ''Crack In Time'' and featured [[Jay Electronica]] and MF Doom.<ref>{{cite web |title=Adult Swim Debuts New KMD Single “True Lightyears” With Jay Electronica + DOOM.
