She has released seven studio albums and done one international tour and a short tour to promote her third studio album.

==Career==
===1990s===

Fey released her first album, titled ''Fey'', in 1995, through Sony Music (Mexico). Within a couple of months of the album's release, Fey had scored several hits in her native [[Mexico]], and had reached #1 with "Media naranja", "Gatos en el balcon", "Me enamoro de ti" and "La noche se mueve". Fey toured Mexico, including consecutive concerts in the [[Teatro Metropólitan|Teatro Metropolitan]], and all of Latin America, and reached [[Music recording sales certification|Gold status]] sales by the end of the year. In 1996 Fey released ''Tierna la Noche''. "[[Azucar Amargo (Fey Song)|Azucar Amargo]]", the CD's first single, stayed in the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] chart for more than 30 weeks. Her tour, Tierna la noche, was also successful. Overall the tour consisted of more than 40 presentations in Mexico, the U.S. and Latin America, as well as some presentations in Europe. At the [[Premio Lo Nuestro 1997|9th Lo Nuestro Awards]], Fey received a nomination for Pop New Artist.<ref name="eltiempo">{{cite news|url=http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-545706|title=Premios a Lo Mejor De La Música Latina|language=es|work=[[El Tiempo (Colombia)|El Tiempo]]|publisher=Casa Editorial El Tiempo S.A.|date=April 8, 1997|access-date=June 10, 2013}}</ref> She is a vegetarian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peta2.com/outthere/o-sexyveg08_winners.asp|title=Milano and Iero: World's Sexiest Vegetarians for 2008!|last=Throstle|first=Patrick|date=July 2008|publisher=peta2.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701095211/http://www.peta2.com/outthere/o-sexyveg08_winners.asp|archive-date=July 1, 2008|access-date=2015-08-24}}</ref>

In 1998, and after more than 8 months of absence, Fey released her third album ''El color de los sueños'', which itself was different from the preceding two in that the album was a mix of different rhythms and styles. "Ni tu ni nadie", the album's first single, instantly reached number one in the Latin charts; "Diselo con flores", "Canela" and "Cielo Liquido" soon followed. Although the record did very well in sales, it did not compare to the over-the-top success of ''Tierna la noche''. In the overall period of the three first albums, Fey’s amazing popularity and promotion caused all but 4 of the singles released to hit #1 in Mexico, with the most important being "Azucar Amargo", "Media Naranja", "Ni tu Ni Nadie", "Muevelo" and "Te Pertenezco", all of them spending more than a month in the top position in Mexico. After almost a year of promotion, Fey announced, at a 1999 charity concert, that: "everything has a cycle, and this is the end of mine".

=== Vertigo (fourth studio album)===
''Vertigo'' was released as a double edition with both an English and Spanish album. The English album contains three songs not included on the Spanish version. After two singles ("The Other Side" and "Dressing to Kill"), Fey left Sony and then retired for two years.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=199806|title=Fey no soportó el Vértigo : Fey no soportó el Vértigo - Artistas|last=Garcia|first=Julio|date=2006-04-23|website=univision.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423041005/http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=199806|archive-date=April 23, 2006|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref>

===La Fuerza del Destino (fifth studio album)===
In 2005, Fey, now a married woman, relaunched her career with ''[[La Fuerza del Destino (Fey album)|La Fuerza del Destino]]'', a tribute to the Spanish group [[Mecano]]. This album was successful; it contained three top-ten singles: "La Fuerza Del Destino", "Barco A Venus" and "Me Cuesta Tanto Olvidarte". A radio-only single, "Un Año Más", was released for the holiday season in Mexico.

Fey toured in support of this album at the Viña del Mar festival 2005, the Selena Vive! festival, and many local clubs across the United States and Latin America. The record excelled sales-wise, and it gave Fey her very first Latin Grammy nomination for "Best Pop Female Vocal Album". She also received 4 nominations for ''Premios Orgullosamente Latino 2005 & 2006''-Ritmoson Latino and a Premio Oye nomination. She was recognized by the [[Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) in Miami in [[17th GLAAD Media Awards|2006]] for supporting gay human rights.

===Faltan Lunas (sixth studio album)===
After the success of her fifth album, Fey released a sixth one, ''[[Faltan Lunas]]'' and was produced by Carlos Jean.<ref name="Inc.2006">{{cite journal|title=Reviews: New and Noteworthy|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA76|date=12 August 2006|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=76–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> It was slated for an August 1, 2006, release, but was released on July 21, Fey's birthday. It features a pop/dance sound along with acoustic elements. The first single released was "Y Aquí Estoy". It was announced by Fey herself that the second single would be "Me Has Vuelto Loca", but it was changed to "Como Un Ángel". The album was only released in a few Latin American countries, and sold around 10,000 copies worldwide, making it her lowest selling album ever. "Como Un Ángel" was released in January 2007, but it failed to make an impact on the charts.

===Dulce Tentación & Sweet Temptation (seventh studio album)===
''[[Dulce Tentación]]'' was released April 28, 2009, and the English version called "Sweet Temptation" was set to be released over the next months. The album was produced by Sam 'FISH' Fisher, who also co-wrote more than half of the songs on the record and will be distributed internationally by Universal Music. One track, "Cicatrices" ["Monsters"] was available for download Fey's official site  at the end of 2008. More than 170,000 downloads were registered while the track was available.

The first official single was "Lentamente" (Let Me Show You), a song that put Fey back in the top of the charts in México. The album was an unexpected success, winning a gold status for over 50.000 copies sold in less than one month in México.<ref name=":0" /> The second single Provócame (Games That you Play) was released in July 2009, however, a conflict between Fey and her new record label Mi Rey Music over promotion differences and the concept of the new video led Fey to part ways with the record label. Fey decided to create her own record label by buying the rights to her music and to Elephant Music from Mi Rey Music.

Late August 2009 Fey announced on her website that she was now in complete control of Elephant Music and continued to promote "Provócame", however, she suspended promotion of the single due to laryngitis.<ref name=wradio>{{cite web|url=http://www.wradio.com.co/nota.aspx?id=867751 |title=Lista Fey para gira por EU tras infección en vías respiratorias &#124; 20090826 |publisher=Wradio.com.co |access-date=2015-08-24}}</ref> The video debuted on September 21, 2009; she also announced that she was to go on tour at the National Auditorium and record a live DVD. Fey toured clubs in the United States and Mexico.

The last single from the album was "Adicto A Mi Cuerpo". Initial plans for a music video were scrapped due to Fey deciding to move on and record a new album, making the single a radio-only release. However, it did chart on several online radio stations. "Sweet Temptation" was shelved as Fey decided to record a new album.

===Family, return to Sony Music, Primera Fila (2012 - 2014)===
During April 2010, it was announced via a press conference that Fey was in the studio recording her eighth studio album, with a lead single tentatively called "Te Amo A Mi Manera" previewed at the conference. The project went to hiatus because of her marriage to Alonso Orozco in September 2010.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.excelsior.com.mx/funcion/2014/07/25/972876|title=Fey y Alonso Orozco Soberón concluyen su proceso de divorcio|date=2014-07-26|website=Excelcior.com|access-date=2016-09-20}}</ref> Fey gave birth to her first child, Isabella, in January, 2011.<ref name=":1" />
