'''Battle rap''' (also known as '''rap battling''')<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC">Edwards, Paul, 2009, p. 25.</ref> is a type of [[rapping]] that includes bragging, insults and boasting content.<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> Battling can occur on recorded albums, though rap battles are often recited or [[freestyle rap|freestyled]] spontaneously in live battles, "where [[Master of ceremonies#Hip hop|MCs]] will perform on the same stage to see who has the better verses".<ref name="Edwards, Paul p MC">Edwards, Paul, 2009, p. 27.</ref>

Although never a battler, battle rap was loosely described by Diplomat's group member [[40 Cal]] in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'' (2009) as "extracurricular" and he compares it to the [[dunk contest]] in the [[NBA]]. Battle rap has since developed into highly organized league events drawing in millions of dollars and views. Battle rap events themselves are usually "sold out". Mainstream artists such as [[Sean Combs|Diddy]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Joe Budden]], and [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]] often attend or participate in battles to help increase its popularity. <ref name="Edwards, Paul p MC"/> Rap battles are often written solely for the purpose of impressing people with technically inventive rapping,<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, p. 28.</ref> and knowing a wide variety of rapping styles and a wide range of [[MC]]s is recommended.<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, p. 28-29.</ref> Some MCs started out writing mostly battle raps and battling other MCs before they began making records.<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, p. 29.</ref>

==History==
Rap battle is generally believed to have started in the [[East Coast hip hop]] scene in the late 1980s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mavima|first=Shingi|date=2016|title=Bigger By the Dozens: The Prevalence of Afro-Based Tradition in Battle Rap|url=https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/225355666.pdf|journal=[[Virginia Common Wealth Scholars Compass]]|via=CORE}}</ref> One of the earliest and most infamous battles occurred in December 1982 when [[Kool Moe Dee]] challenged [[Busy Bee Starski]]<ref name="Blow Average">{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2007-04-26/news/blow-average/|title=Blow Average}}</ref> – Busy Bee Starski's defeat by the more complex raps of Kool Moe Dee meant that "no longer was an MC just a crowd-pleasing comedian with a slick tongue; he was a commentator and a storyteller" thus, rendering Busy's archaic format of rap obsolete, in favor of a newer style<ref name="Blow Average"/> which [[KRS-One]] also credits as creating a shift in [[rapping]] in the documentary ''[[Beef (documentary)|Beef]]''.<ref>''Beef'' documentary, 2003, Peter Spirer, Aslan Productions.</ref>

In the 1980s, battle raps were a popular form of rapping – [[Big Daddy Kane]] in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'' says, "as an [[MC]] from the '80s, really your mentality is battle format... your focus was to have a hot rhyme in case you gotta battle someone... not really making a rhyme for a song".<ref name="Edwards, Paul 2009, p MC"/> Battle rapping is still sometimes closely associated with [[old school hip-hop]] – talking about battle rapping, [[7L & Esoteric|Esoteric]] says, "a lot of my stuff stems from [[old school hip-hop]], braggadocio ethic".<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, p. 26.</ref>

The [[New Music Seminar]] (NMS) is a Music Conference and Festival held annually each June in [[New York City]]. The New Music Seminar originally ran from 1980 to 1995. It quickly spawned the MC and DJ Battles for World Supremacy – a fertile showcase for rappers and DJs to make a name for themselves. Participants include a wide variety of very influential rappers such as [[Busy Bee Starski|Busy Bee]], [[Melle Mel]], [[MF Grimm]], and [[Kool G Rap]] with judges such as [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[P Diddy]], and many other influential rappers.

Some of the most prominent battles that took place on record are listed in the book, ''[[ego trip (magazine)|Ego Trip]]'s Book of Rap Lists'', and include such battles as the [[Roxanne Wars]] (1984–1985), [[Juice Crew]] vs. [[Boogie Down Productions]] (1986–1988), Kool Moe Dee vs. [[LL Cool J]] (1987–1991), [[MC Serch]] vs. [[MC Hammer]] (1989–1994), [[Dr. Dre]] & [[Snoop Dogg]] vs. [[Luther Campbell|Luke]] (1992–1993), [[Common (rapper)|Common]] vs. [[Ice Cube (rapper)|Ice Cube]] (1994–1996), MC Pervis & Brand New Habits and [[LL Cool J]] vs. [[Canibus]] (1997–1998) – all of which include memorable battle rap verses.<ref>[[Ego trip (magazine)|Ego trip]], 1999, ''[[Ego trip (magazine)|Ego trip]]'s Book of Rap Lists'', St. Martin's Press, p. 236-237.</ref>

As hip-hop asserted its presence across the country, MC battles were growing in popularity. One of the early predecessors of the contemporary, more confrontational variation of battle rap was the 1994 face-off between [[Craig G]] and [[Supernatural (rapper)|Supernatural]]. The battle happened organically, by virtue of Supernatural calling out Craig G while he was performing. As it so happened, Craig G was in the crowd, and the host invited him to the stage. Craig G won the battle that evening. The two would go on to meet on two other occasions during the 1990s, thereby establishing a place in battle rap as one of the earliest and most exciting sagas in the subculture.

From the late 1990s to end of the 2000s, freestyle rapping became very popular, with many artists getting attention for new styles, charisma, and witty punchlines in battles such as [[Scribble Jam]] and Rocksteady.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://urb.com/2009/12/21/scribble-jammed-festival-in-flux-pt-1/|title=Scribble Jam in Flux|website=Urb Magazine|publisher=Urb Magazine|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522020615/http://www.urb.com/2009/12/21/scribble-jammed-festival-in-flux-pt-1/|archive-date=2011-05-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Following the resurgence of freestyle battling in the 21st century, competitions began to move to TV shows shown on [[HBO]], [[BET]], and [[MTV]]. In addition, Eminem's 2002 movie ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'' introduced battle rap to mainstream audiences, generating a renewed interest and popularity in  battling.

Starting in the early 2000s, [[Freestyle Friday]] is a watered-down battle segment on [[BET|BET's]] popular show [[106 & Park]]. Two rappers compete in a freestyle battle before the studio audience and three celebrity judges (the DJ sometimes acts as the 3rd judge). Each competitor alternates freestyling for 30 seconds in each of the two rounds (originally only 1 round when the segment first began). The rappers are not allowed to use profanities or sexually suggestive lyrics, punishable by disqualification. After the battle, the judges decide the winner, per majority vote.

Eventually, battle rap moved to a format which is now the predominant form of battle rap, where two emcees battle against each other without a beat, trading prewritten verses in three-round battles. The impromptu aspect of battling still exists in the form of rebuttals, which are short rhymes (usually in the beginning of a verse) where an emcee either comments on something about their opponent that was thought up on the spot (for instance, making fun of the shirt they're wearing), or responds to something their opponent said during their previous round. While not as prominent as it once was, the art of rebutting is still respected by many as difficult to do correctly, and a sign of a well-rounded emcee.

While many creative minds were battling and organizing battles in the early 2000s, Troy “Smack” Mitchell of Queens New York gathered battle rappers of hood renown including [[Serius Jones]] of New Jersey and Loaded Lux, [[Murda Mook]] and [[Jae Millz]] of Harlem, Smack began recording battles, printing and hand-selling the DVDs—a cutting edge technological and artistic hustle at the time.

Fight Klub is one of the earliest battle rap leagues and was the only league that aired on TV. It aired on [[MTV2]] sometime in 2006. It is hosted by international P. A lot of the original rappers on there are now legendary in the battle rap game such as Arsonal, [[MC Jin|Jin]], [[Hollow da Don|Hollow da don]].

Jump Off TV's World Rap Championships premiered in London 2006, featuring American and British rappers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/the-tournament-that-changed-the-rap-battle-game-6654455|title=The Tournament That Changed the Rap Battle Game|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref>

In Cuba, freestyle battles often follow organized concerts and juxtapose composed songs with ‘flowing’ lyrics that are relevant to the present situation.<ref>Baker, Geoffrey. 2006. "La Habana que no conoces: Cuban rap and the social construction of urban space." Ethnomusicology Forum 15, no. 2: 215-46</ref> Freestyling can allow audience members to integrate into the performance stage. This provides a forum for up-and-coming underground artists to engage in a musical discussion with already prominent underground Cuban rappers. Freestyle battles often turn political when artists incorporate perspectives on social disparities and issues plaguing the Cuban population.<ref>AP Oct. 4, 2004. "Cuban Hip-Hop Reaches Crossroads: Artists Struggle to Meld Politics and Commercialism" CBS News</ref>

==Battle types==
A ''freestyle battle'' is a [[competition|contest]] in which two or more [[rapping|rappers]] compete or ''battle'' each other using improvised lyrics. Each competitor's goal is to "[[Insult|diss]]" their opponent through clever lyrics. As hip-hop evolved in the early 1980s, MCs gained their fame through live battles with other MCs. Freestyle battles can take place anywhere: on street corners, on stage at a concert, in school, or even online.

The live audience is critical to a battle as each [[Emcees|emcee]] (MC; Master of Ceremonies) must use skill and lyrical ability not only to 'break down' their opponent, but to convince the audience that they are the better rapper. Appointed judges have been used in formal contests, but even when no winner is announced, the rapper who receives the best audience response is viewed as the victor. Currently, talents such as [[Hollow Da Don]] use various elements of battle rap that include reciting a written format created through months of preparation mixed with improvised lines as means to attacking his opponent or creating an image of himself as greater than his adversary. This is presented in his battle against Tay Roc in the main event of the Ultimate Rap League's "Summer Madness 6," a battle that the general consensus believes that Hollow Da Don walked away from in victory Summer Madness 6 main event.<ref>{{cite web |title=Who Won Hollow Da Don vs. Tay Roc At URL's Summer Madness 6? |url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.44612/title.who-won-hollow-da-don-vs-tay-roc-at-urls-summer-madness-6# |website=HipHopDX |access-date=5 August 2019 |date=11 September 2017}}</ref> Fellow battle rap peer [[Conceited (rapper)|Conceited]] has made a name for himself in this field as well as a more popularized version of competitive rapping on a television platform. While he takes a more humorous approach to his opposition, he still performs with the intention of winning a contest.

A ''cipher'' is any collection or gathering of rappers, beatboxers, or breakers forming in a circle in order to perform together – the term has also in recent years come to mean the crowd which forms around the battles, consisting of spectators and onlookers. This group serves partly to encourage competition and partly to enhance the communal aspect of rap battles. The cipher is known for “making or breaking reputations in the hip hop community; if you are able to step into the cipher and tell your story, demonstrating your uniqueness, you might be more accepted".<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chang |first=Jeff |author-link=<!--Not the singer Jeff Chang.--> |date=12 October 2009 |title=It's a Hip-hop World |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/12/its-a-hip-hop-world/ |journal=Foreign Policy |access-date=22 May 2015}}</ref> These groups also serve as a way for messages about hip hop styles and knowledge to be spread, through word-of-mouth and encouraging trends in other battles.<ref name="mnartists">{{Cite web

==Battle rap leagues==
Leagues such as [[King of the Dot]] ([[Canada]]), Grind Time Now ([[United States|U.S.]]) and [[Don't Flop]] ([[United Kingdom|U.K.]]), which all started in 2008, with [[Ultimate Rap League]] ([[New York City|N.Y.]]) in 2009, furthered the popularity of battle rap via video hosting website [[YouTube]], brand marketing, and creating divisions across their home nations and beyond.

King of the Dot's Travis Fleetwood, a.k.a. [[Organik (musician)|Organik]], built a reputation as one of Canada's elite battle emcees with 4 wins at the [[Toronto]]-based freestyle competition ''Proud 2B Eh Battle MC'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDfvo5nUHA4 |title=PROLIFIC VS.

They teamed up to put together the first event which was initially intended to be a [[flash mob]] style event at [[Yonge-Dundas Square]] in downtown Toronto. However, the police presence and private security at the location forced the event to move down the road to an alley beside radio station [[CFXJ-FM|Flow 93.5]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flow935.com/ |title=Home |publisher=FLOW 93-5 |access-date=2015-11-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7lfDeE7Bro&feature=relmfu |title=KOTD – Rap Battle – Kid Twist vs Big Mac Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-11-16 |access-date=2015-11-28}}</ref> After a few events at that location, they were unable to accommodate the growing crowds, so Organik opted to re-locate to [[Alexandra Park, Toronto|Alexandra Park]] for the wide open space and gritty location. The crisp visuals and production value, as well as local celebrity guest judges contributed to King of the Dot's rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kingofthedot.com |title=KOTDTV |publisher=Kingofthedot.com |access-date=2015-11-28}}</ref>

Smack and [[Ultimate Rap League]] (URL) are New York-based battle leagues. Rappers included Aye Verb (StreetStatus), Conceited (LionsDen), DNA (GrindTimeNow) Hitman Holla (StreetStatus), Tay Roc (LionsDen), Hollow Da Don (GrindTimeNow) and many more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/05/smack-url-battle-rap-interview/|title=Smack and Ultimate Rap League Push Battle Rap to the Next Level|publisher=[[XXL Magazine]]|access-date=2016-08-24}}</ref>

The first all-female rap battle league, called [[Queen of the Ring]] was founded in 2010 in response to the [[Ultimate Rap League]]. Although female battle rappers such as Mis Led and Drizz Mami existed in other leagues, they were significantly less prevalent in the scene. Queen of the Ring gained attention quickly, as well as an avid fan base. It is now considered one of the "Top Five" big battle leagues (along with Versus battle, URL, Don't Flop, KOTD). Many female battlers are widely known in the community, with female battles in the majority of big events held by any of the other "Top Five" leagues. As female battlers have gained recognition, male versus female battles have also become popular.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[Don't Flop]] is a popular UK rap battle league founded in 2008, following a controversial judging decision in which co-founder, Eurgh, was denied a place in the finals of a tournament run by the then-dominant battle league, JumpOff.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkaic & Eurgh vs Frankie Wapps & Jaze Juce – World Rap Championships 2007|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEJn2T0cyz4|access-date=28 May 2015}}</ref> Since then, notable appearances include [[Rizzle Kicks|Rizzle]], [[Illmaculate]], [[Mystro]], and Harry Love. Don't Flop came to mainstream UK media attention in 2012 when one of their battles became a [[viral video]], purportedly showing a teacher battling his student. Although the battlers in question, [[Mark Grist]] and Blizzard were not student and teacher, the narrative was enough to give the league a huge boost in exposure.<ref>{{cite web|title=The teacher who beat a student in a rap battle|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/shortcuts/2012/feb/12/teacher-student-rap-battle|access-date=28 May 2015}}</ref> In 2014, former Don't Flop performers and staff broke away to form King of the Ronalds as a reaction to Don't Flop's move towards a more sanitized version of the product<ref>{{cite web|title=The Attitude Era of battle rap|url=https://kingoftheronalds.wordpress.com/2015/01/07/the-attitude-era-of-battle-rap/|access-date=28 May 2015}}</ref> and sponsorship from the likes of [[Foot Locker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Don't Flop Roster Loses Battles To ...

The league markets itself primarily using videos of tense physical confrontations between battlers,<ref>{{cite web|title=Battle Rapper Gets Violated on KOTR|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOnYoC9Euzk|access-date=28 May 2015}}</ref> something other leagues are keen to distance themselves from.

[[FlipTop Battle League]], Sunugan Battle League, Bahay Katay Battle League, Laglagan Battle League and WordWar Battle League are examples of battle rap leagues in the [[Philippines]].

Bullpen Battle League, based in Atlanta, was featured in Season 2, Episode 8 - "Battle to the Death" of Jermaine Dupree's The Rap Game. 2016
