'''KMFDM''' <!--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS TO KEIN MITLEID FÜR DIE MEHRHEIT; IT IS INTENDED TO BE GRAMMATICALLY INCORRECT--PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE TRANSLATION TO "no majority for the pity"; WE ARE USING THE OFFICIAL BAND TRANSLATION IN THE LEAD, AND EXPLAINING IT IN THE BODY-->(originally '''Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid''', loosely translated by the band as "no pity for the majority")<ref name="1997 History"/> is a German [[industrial music|industrial]] band from [[Hamburg]] led by [[Sascha Konietzko]], who founded the band in 1984 as a performance art project.

The band's earliest incarnation included German drummer [[En Esch]] and British vocalist [[Raymond Watts]], the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. The trio recorded the band's earliest albums in Germany before Konietzko and Esch moved to the United States, where they found much greater success with seminal industrial record label [[Wax Trax!]]. German guitarist [[Günter Schulz]] joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin) on [[Metropolis Records]], and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer [[Lucia Cifarelli]], British guitarists [[Jules Hodgson]] and [[Steve White (guitarist)|Steve White]], and British drummer [[Andy Selway]]. Konietzko and Cifarelli moved back to Germany in 2007, while the rest of the band stayed in the U.S. Hodgson and White moved on to other pursuits between 2015 and 2017, leaving the band a working trio unofficially. In addition to these core members, dozens of other musicians have worked with the group across its twenty studio albums and two dozen singles, with sales totaling in excess of two million records worldwide.

Critics consider KMFDM to be one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences, though Konietzko refers to the band's music as "The Ultra-Heavy Beat". The band incorporates [[heavy metal (music)|heavy metal]] guitar riffs, [[electronic music]], samples, and both male and female vocals in its music, which encompasses a variety of styles including [[industrial rock]] and [[electronic body music]]. The band is fiercely political, with many of its lyrics taking stands against violence, war, and oppression. KMFDM normally tours at least once after every major release, and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans, both online and at concerts. Members, singly or working together and with other musicians, have recorded under many other names, primarily Watts' [[Pig (musical project)|Pig]], Konietzko's [[Excessive Force]], and Esch and Schulz's [[Slick Idiot]].

KMFDM was officially founded in Paris, France, on February 29, 1984, as a [[performance art]] project between [[Sascha Konietzko]] and German painter and multimedia artist Udo Sturm at the opening of an exhibition of young European artists at the [[Grand Palais]].<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> The first show consisted of Sturm playing an [[ARP 2600]] synthesizer, Konietzko playing bass guitars with their amplifiers spread throughout the building,<ref name="WDYKD">{{cite AV media notes | title=What Do You Know, Deutschland? | title-link=What Do You Know, Deutschland? | others=KMFDM | year=2006 | type=CD booklet | page=2 | publisher=[[Metropolis Records]] | id=MET439 | location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania}}</ref> and four Polish coal miners (whom Konietzko had met at a [[bordello]])<ref name="RS740"/> pounding on the foundations of the Grand Palais.<ref name="1997 History">{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/history.html | title=KMFDM History| publisher=KMFDM Inc | access-date=April 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19970408173452/http://www.kmfdm.net/history.html |archive-date=April 8, 1997}}</ref>

[[File:KMFDM Castle Party 2009 07.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Sascha Konietzko]] performing in Bolków, Poland in July 2009]]
KMFDM is an [[initialism]] for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect [[German (language)|German]] phrase ''Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid'', which, keeping the same word order,  literally translates as "no majority for the pity", but is typically given the loose translation of "no pity for the majority".<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/><ref name=deseret-may-1995/><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/outcast-clique-proud-role-article-1.830051 | author=Kennedy, Helen | title=Outcast Clique Proud of Role | work=[[New York Daily News]] | publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]] | date=April 21, 1999 | access-date=October 27, 2012}}</ref><ref name=CMJ-604/> In the original phrase, the articles preceding the nouns ''Mehrheit'' and ''Mitleid'' are [[inflection|inflected]] for the wrong [[grammatical gender|gender]], as the proper [[declension]] would be ''Keine Mehrheit für das Mitleid.'' Swapping the two nouns yields the grammatically correct ''Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit'', which translates directly as "no pity for the majority". In a 2003 interview, Konietzko explained the origins of the phrase:

{{quote|text="On the morning of February 29th, 1984 I woke up and went down to breakfast at a hotel in Paris. We had a show that night opening for an exhibition for young European artists.&nbsp;... we needed a motto for the night so that we could make up some fliers and post them around. There was a German newspaper on the table and so I started cutting out words and threw them all into a cap. We picked a few of them out and it read "Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid". It's kinda improper German in regards to its translation but in the [[Dada|DA-DA]]-esque{{sic}} mindset of the early morning it made perfect sense. So when I was on my way back to Hamburg I'd mentioned it to [[Raymond Watts|Raymond [Watts]]]. He liked it but he was having difficulty pronouncing it correctly. So finally he said, 'Why don't you just call it KMFDM?' So that was it. We were KMFDM."<ref name=mk/>}}

The initialism has jokingly been said to stand for "Kill Mother-Fucking [[Depeche Mode]]", coined by the band on their first U.S. tour and used as recently as ''Kunst''.<ref name=hybrid/>

===Early years in Germany (1984–89)===

Sturm left early on,<ref name=AllMusic-bio/> but Konietzko continued performing, at one point having twenty people in his troupe, which by then was engaged in antics such as [[fire eating]] and throwing entrails at audiences.<ref name="RS740">{{cite journal | url=http://www.waste.org/~alone/kmfdm/rsinterview.html | title=KMFDM make industrial music the old-fashioned way.

==Touring and fanbase==
[[File:Andy Selway.jpg|thumb|right|[[Andy Selway]] performing live with KMFDM]]
KMFDM has released on average an album every year and a half, and usually tours at least once in support of each album. At most concert venues, KMFDM mingles with the fans before and after the show to sign autographs, pose for photos, and answer questions.<ref name=hybrid>{{cite web | url=http://www.hybridmagazine.com/music/0702/kmfdm.shtml | title=KMFDM Reloads with: Attak | author1=Freedland, Israel | author2=Schneider, Justin | work=Hybrid Magazine | publisher= [noun] digital media | access-date=May 9, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020810170201/http://www.hybridmagazine.com/music/0702/kmfdm.shtml|archive-date=August 10, 2002}}</ref> Konietzko, who keeps in contact with fans via e-mail and the band's website,<ref name=borzillo>{{cite journal | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qQkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA9 | title=Wax Trax!/TVT's KMFDM Rides Industrial Revolution with 8th Set | journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | author=Borzillo, Carrie | publisher=[[Nielsen Business Media, Inc]] | volume=108 | number=25 | pages=9, 97 | date=June 22, 1996 | access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> and band representatives have experimented with ways for fans to interact more directly. KMFDM launched "Horde" in 2002, an exclusive fan club which gave members the opportunity to attend a private meet-and-greet with the band before every show, and allowed access to members-only music and footage online. A featurette on the Horde fan club appears on the ''[[WWIII Live 2003]]'' DVD.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=1929_0_2_0_C | author=Van Isacker, Bernard | title=World Tour 2003 KMFDM sees DVD/CD release in June and July | work=SideLine News | publisher=SideLine | date=June 10, 2004 | access-date=May 8, 2012}}</ref>

In the 2004 ''Fankam'' project, an audience member was selected at each concert to record that night's show, as well as some back-stage antics, with a hand-held digital video camera. The resulting footage was incorporated into the following year's ''20th Anniversary World Tour'' DVD, which included fan photos submitted to the KMFDM official website. KMFDM encouraged fans to call a special "FanPhone" and leave a voice message in March 2007.<ref name=ult-guitar>{{cite web | url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/sascha_konietzko_of_kmfdm_i_actually_am_not_a_musician.html | title=Sascha Konietzko of KMFDM: 'I Actually Am Not A Musician' | date=November 10, 2007 | publisher=Ultimate Guitar | access-date=March 3, 2010}}</ref> The song "Superpower" from 2007's ''Tohuvabohu'' includes sound-clips from these messages.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.revenantmedia.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1193&Itemid=37 | title=KMFDM's Sascha Konietzko Part 1 | author=Cooper, Christina | work=Revenant Media | publisher=Revenant Media | date=August 28, 2007 | access-date=March 2, 2010 }}</ref> The band used the Fankam project again for its 2011 "Kein Mitleid" tour in the United States.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.kmfdm.net/fankam/ | title=Fankam | publisher=KMFDM Inc | access-date=May 8, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401032205/http://kmfdm.net/fankam/ | archive-date=April 1, 2016 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
