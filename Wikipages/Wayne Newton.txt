'''Carson Wayne Newton''' (born April 3, 1942) is an American singer and actor. One of the best-known entertainers in Las Vegas, he is known by the nicknames The Midnight Idol, Mr. Las Vegas and Mr. Entertainment. His well known songs include 1972's "[[Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast|Daddy, Don't You Walk So Fast]]" (his biggest hit, peaking at No. 4 on the [[Hot 100]]), "[[Years (song)#Wayne Newton cover|Years]]" (1980),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allbutforgottenoldies.net/wayne-newton.html |title=Wayne Newton – Songs |publisher=Allbutforgottenoldies.net |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref> and his vocal version of "[[Red Roses for a Blue Lady]]" (1965). His [[signature song]] "[[Danke Schoen]]" (1963) was notably used in the score for ''[[Ferris Bueller's Day Off]]'' (1986).

While he was a child, his family moved to near [[Newark, Ohio]]. He began singing in local clubs, theaters, and fairs with his older brother, [[Jerry Newton|Jerry]]. Because of Newton's severe asthma, his family moved to [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in 1952, where he left [[North High School (Phoenix, Arizona)|North High School]] just before finishing his junior year.<ref name="OhioBio"/><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biography.com/people/wayne-newton-9542098#synopsis | publisher=Biography.com | title=Wayne Newton Biography | access-date=September 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204214755/http://www.biography.com/people/wayne-newton-9542098 | archive-date=December 4, 2013}}</ref><ref name="SuperPics">{{cite web|title=Wayne Newton / Biography|url=http://www.superiorpics.com/wayne_newton/|website=superiorpics.com|publisher=SuperiorPics.com|access-date=26 December 2017|quote=A graduate of North High School, Newton flew his senior class and their spouses and partners to Las Vegas ... in 1979 for the 20th anniversary of his class reunion.}}</ref> The brothers, as the Rascals in Rhythm, appeared with the [[Grand Ole Opry]] roadshows and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]]'s ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]''; and performed in front of then-president [[Dwight D.

In the spring of 1958, near the end of his junior year of high school, a Las Vegas booking agent saw Newton on a local TV show, ''Lew King Rangers Show'', on which the two Newton brothers were performing and took them back for an audition. Originally signed for two weeks, the brothers eventually performed for five years, doing six shows a day. On September 29, 1962, they first performed on ''[[The Jackie Gleason Show]]''. Wayne would perform on Gleason's show 12 times over the following two years. In the early to mid-1960s, he also acted and sang as "Andy" the baby-faced Ponderosa ranch hand on the classic western TV series, ''[[Bonanza]]''.

By 1963, Newton had been signed to Capitol Records, and his first album was released on the label.  His hit "[[Danke Schoen]]" reached no. 13 on the Hot 100.

==Career as an entertainer==
{{BLP sources section|date=July 2018}}
Many prominent entertainment icons such as [[Lucille Ball]], [[Bobby Darin]], [[Danny Thomas]], [[George Burns]], and [[Jack Benny]] lent Newton their support. In particular, Benny hired Newton as an opening act for his show. After his job with Benny ended, Newton was offered a job to open for another comic at the [[Flamingo Las Vegas|Flamingo Hotel]], but Newton asked for, and was given, a headline act.<ref name="LVS 2008-05-15">{{Cite news|url=https://m.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/may/15/evolution-worlds-entertainment-capital/|title=Showtime: How Sin City evolved into 'The Entertainment Capital of the World'|last1=Koch|first1=Ed|last2=Manning|first2=Mary|date=May 15, 2008|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|access-date=March 3, 2019|last3=Toplikar|first3=Dave}}</ref>  In 1972 his recording of "Daddy, Don't You Walk So Fast" sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in July 1972.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Influential music director Rosalie Trombley of Canadian station [[CKLW (AM)|CKLW]] "The Big 8" radio in the Detroit-Windsor area decided to add the record to her radio station to embarrass her ex-husband, who wasn't faithful about seeing his children, as Trombley explained in the documentary ''Radio Revolution: The Rise and Fall of the Big 8.''  The record topped the Canadian charts. From Detroit, "[[Daddy Don't You Walk So Fast]]" took off and broke nationwide.

Newton's "distinctive high-pitched voice stayed with him as he progressed from teen singer to Las Vegas legend," although his voice did lower somewhat in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/wayne-newton-mn0000252495/biography |title=Wayne Newton |first=John |last=Bush |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=July 2, 2020}}</ref>

From 1980 through 1982, [[The Beach Boys]] and [[The Grass Roots]] performed Independence Day concerts on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], attracting large crowds.<ref>{{cite news|title=July 4: Day of Music, Parades, Fireworks|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1982-07-03|page=D1}}</ref><ref name=McCombs>(1) {{cite news|last=McCombs|first=Phil|date=1983-04-06|title=Watt Outlaws Rock Music on Mall for July 4|work=[[The Washington Post|The&nbsp;Washington Post]]|page=A.1}}<br>(2) {{cite news|last=McCombs|first=Phil and Harrington, Richard|date=1983-04-07|title=Watt Sets Off Uproar with Music Ban|work=[[The Washington Post|The&nbsp;Washington Post]]|pages=A.1, A.17}}</ref> However, in April 1983, [[James G. Watt]], [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|President Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]], banned Independence Day concerts on the Mall by such groups. Watt said that "[[rock band]]s" that had performed on the Mall on Independence Day in 1981 and 1982 had encouraged drug use and alcoholism and had attracted "the wrong element", who would [[robbery|mug]] individuals and families attending any similar events in the future.<ref name=McCombs/>  Watt then announced that Newton, a friend and supporter of President Reagan and a contributor to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] political campaigns, would perform at the Mall's 1983 Independence Day celebration.<ref name=McCombs/><ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074349/http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Wayne_Newton.php|archive-date=2013-01-17|url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Wayne_Newton.php|title=Campaign contributions of Wayne Newton|date=2012-01-16|publisher=NEWSMEAT by Polity Media, Inc.|access-date=2015-03-04}}</ref>  Newton entered the Independence Day stage on the Mall on July 4, 1983, to mostly cheering members of the audience, but some members [[booing|booed]].<ref>(1) {{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=soE0AAAAIBAJ&pg=2280,5284705&hl=en|first=Tim (Associated Press)|last=Ahern|title=Newton concert goes off despite rain|work=Gettysburg Times|page=7|date=1983-07-05|access-date=2010-02-18}}<br>(2) {{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SdcxAAAAIBAJ&pg=3000,2778153&hl=en|title=Newton Performance Dampened by Rain|last=Associated Press|work=Reading Eagle|page=27|date=1983-07-05|access-date=2010-02-18}}<br>(3) {{cite web|first=John|last=Katsilometes|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2009/oct/30/newtons-recounting-1983-show-national-mall-telling|title=Newton's recounting of Beach Boys controversy a telling moment in 'Once Before I Go'|work=The Kats Report|publisher=Las Vegas Sun|date=2009-10-30|access-date=2009-01-29}}</ref>

On May 23, 1989, Newton's live stage show was broadcast as a [[pay-per-view]] event called ''[[Wayne Newton Live in Concert]]''. Newton did not perform his trademark songs "[[Danke Schoen]]" or "[[Red Roses for a Blue Lady]]". However, he closed the show with a special finale of "[[MacArthur Park (song)|MacArthur Park]]", which culminated with an onstage rainfall.

On December 12, 1992, Newton hit #1 on the Cashbox Pop and Country charts with an [[Elvis Presley]]-inspired song, "[[The Letter (Wayne Newton song)|The Letter]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cashboxmagazine.com/archives/90s_files/1992.html |title=Cash Box Top Singles - 1992 |publisher=cashboxmagazine.com |access-date=2015-08-26}}</ref> Controversy swirled around this chart feat, as "The Letter" did not chart at all on Billboard Magazine's authoritative Hot 100 chart, Adult Contemporary chart or "Bubbling Under" chart. It did not make the Radio and Records magazine chart either. This marked the first and only time in history that a record hit #1 on the Cashbox Top 100 chart, yet failed even to chart on Billboard's Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jabartlett.wordpress.com/2008/12/12/mystery-letter/ |title=Top 5: Mystery Letter &#124; The Hits Just Keep On Comin' |publisher=Jabartlett.wordpress.com |date=2008-12-12 |access-date=2015-08-26}}</ref>

[[File:Wayne Newton 2005.jpg|right|thumb|220 px|Wayne Newton strums the guitar during his USO show at the Patriotic Festival held on the Virginia Beach Oceanfront. May, 2005.]]
In 1994, he performed his 25,000th solo show in Las Vegas.

In 1999, Newton signed a 10-year deal with the [[Stardust Resort & Casino|Stardust]], calling for him to perform there 40 weeks out of the year for six shows a week in a showroom named after him. Orchestrated by his business partner, [[Jack Wishna]], this "headliner-in-residence" deal was the first of its kind. In 2005, in preparation for the eventual demolition of the casino, the deal was, from all reports, amicably terminated; Newton began a 30-show stint that summer at the [[Las Vegas Hilton|Hilton]]. His last show at the Stardust was on April 20, 2005.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-04-07-wayne-newton_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Wayne Newton leaving longtime Vegas stint | date=April 7, 2005}}</ref> During a break in his on stage performance, he announced to the crowd that night he wanted to spend more time with his wife and new daughter as the main reasonings for canceling the contract. Newton said the Boyd family made him a very nice offer to stay on past the demolition of the hotel and casino and to play in other Boyd venues, but Newton declined citing "another deal in the works for Vegas", but he did not mention the Hilton specifically. News crews were expecting this performance to end on time, to make their 10&nbsp;pm and 11&nbsp;pm shows, but the show finally ended around 11:30&nbsp;pm, thus eliminating the possibility. Mr. Las Vegas went on at 7:30 that night, and sang nearly his entire repertoire and songs of other Vegas mainstays as well.  Newton performed at the Stardust until the resort closed on November 1, 2006.

Newton was elected to the [[Gaming Hall of Fame]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Gaming Hall of Fame |url=http://gaming.unlv.edu/hof/index.html |publisher=[[University of Nevada Las Vegas]] |access-date=2009-08-30}}</ref>

In 2001, Newton succeeded [[Bob Hope]] as chairman of the USO Celebrity Circle. In January 2005, Newton started a reality television show on [[E!]] called ''The Entertainer''. The winner got a spot in his act, plus a headlining act of their own for a year. And during player introductions at the [[2007 NBA All-Star Weekend]] in Las Vegas, Newton sang Presley's
[[Viva Las Vegas#Cover versions of "Viva Las Vegas", the song|"Viva Las Vegas."]]

Newton was the grand marshal of the 80th Annual Shenandoah Apple Blossom Festival in [[Winchester, Virginia]], May 1–7, 2007.<ref>[http://www.thebloom.com/celebrities.html#newton] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319111033/http://www.thebloom.com/celebrities.html#newton|date=March 19, 2007}}</ref> He canceled a sold-out show to join the Festival.

Newton was featured on the 2007 fall season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' partnered with two-time champion [[Cheryl Burke]]. He became the third contestant to be eliminated from the contest. During the taping (which takes place at [[CBS Television City]]), he also became the first guest on ''[[The Price Is Right (US game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', which tapes on the same lot, under host [[Drew Carey]], who began adding guests to the show, especially to present prizes. Newton appeared after a trip to Las Vegas was shown.

In 2007 Newton revealed on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' how he personally confronted [[Johnny Carson]] about jokes ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' host was making about him. Newton said he thought:
<blockquote>
"Johnny Carson is a mean-spirited human being. And there are people that he has hurt that people will never know about. And for some reason at some point, he decided to turn that kind of negative attention toward me. And I refused to have it."<ref name="justin">{{cite news | work=[[CNN]]| title=Wayne Newton on Larry King Live| url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0711/29/lkl.01.html| access-date=2008-05-11}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube|id=323NWOIQmlc|title=Wayne Newton Takes A Strip Off Johnny Carson}}</ref>
</blockquote>

However, in 1993, Newton first told the story on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' but disclosed that he actually had slapped Carson, a detail he would leave out of the King interview 14 years later.<ref>{{cite web |title=Wayne Newton Interview 1993 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zNWWz4ssDg&t=649s |publisher=Late Night with Conan O'Brien |access-date=February 8, 2019}}</ref>

In 2008, Newton received a [[Woodrow Wilson Awards|Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service]]. The [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], a national memorial to President Wilson, commemorates "the ideals and concerns of [[Woodrow Wilson]]." The award honors leaders who have given back to their communities.

Beginning October 14, 2009, he began performing his then newest show "Once Before I Go" at the [[Tropicana Las Vegas|Tropicana]] in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticketstogo.com/wayne_newton_tickets.html |title=Wayne Newton's performance dates |publisher=Ticketstogo.com |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>  A year later he took a 5-year hiatus to spend time with his family and prepare his voice for a future Las Vegas residency. In 2016, Newton returned to the stage at Bally's Hotel in the form of a lounge show called "Up Close & Personal", a combination of live singing, playing some of the 13 self-taught instruments (having learned in the past to give his voice a rest when performing 6 shows a night at the Fremont Hotel), and showing movie and TV clips on screen.

After performing more than 30,000 shows on the [[Las Vegas strip]], Newton celebrated his 60th year on stage in Las Vegas with a show entitled "Mr. Las Vegas" at [[Caesars Palace]] casino-resort from January 28, 2019 through May. Newton told the [[Associated Press]], “It's hard for me to articulate, much less think about it,” referring to the anniversary. “I was here when Caesars (Palace) was built. This hotel for me has always represented the flagship of the Strip.” <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/97ba2da549c44563bbc8546253383e76 |title=Wayne Newton celebrates 60 years in Las Vegas with new show |publisher=The Associated Press |access-date=2019-01-27}}</ref>

In June 2020, Newton was seen on television commercials in [[North America]] as a [[spokesperson]] for [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Caesars Entertainment]] to promote the reopening of Caesars Entertainment resorts during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the United States|COVID-19 pandemic]].

==Family==
In 1968, Newton married Elaine Okamura. They have one child, Erin Newton, born July 25, 1981; they divorced in 1985. In 1994, Newton married Kathleen McCrone, a lawyer from [[North Olmsted, Ohio]]. The couple have one daughter, Lauren Ashley Newton, who was born on April 19, 2000.

He bought his first horse when he sold his bicycle and his parents' movie camera to buy a foal when he was a sixth-grader. Originally owning [[Thoroughbred]]s and [[American Quarter Horses]], he "fell in love" with the Arabian breed via his ownership of the Champion stallion Aramus, after whom he named his horse ranch.<ref name=McCall/>  He first came to the attention of Arabian breeders in 1969 when he partnered with Tom Chauncey, an Arabian breeder and television station owner, to purchase the stallion [[Naborr]] from the estate of Anne [[McCormick family|McCormick]].<ref name=Lauter/> They paid $150,000, which at the time was the highest price ever paid for an Arabian horse at auction.<ref name=Reif>{{cite web|last1=Reif|first1=Rita|title=Art Upstage by Horses at an Arizona Auction|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1982/02/16/us/art-upstage-by-horses-at-an-arizona-auction.html|website=New York Times|access-date=12 November 2015|date=February 16, 1982}}</ref>  Shortly thereafter, Newton formed a partnership with other Arabian breeders to purchase Aramus, who was a son of Naborr. He became the sole owner of Aramus in 1972.<ref name=Lauter/>

Newton was given the Arabian Horse Breeders' Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 2007.<ref name=Lauter>{{cite web|last1=Lauter|first1=Jo West|title=2007 LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD: To Mr. Wayne Newton . . .

He was awarded the Arabian Professional and Amateur Horseman's Association Breeder of the Year award in 1996.<ref name=McCall/>

==Finances and legal problems==
From 1980 to 1982, Newton was part owner of the [[Aladdin, Las Vegas|Aladdin Hotel]], in a partnership that led to a number of lawsuits and a failed attempt by Newton to purchase the entire hotel in 1983.<ref>[http://www.lasvegassun.com/dossier/events/aladdin/history2.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207051528/http://www.lasvegassun.com/dossier/events/aladdin/history2.html|date=February 7, 2006}}</ref>

In 1985, Newton bought a 213-acre property at [[Lake Tahoe]] near [[Zephyr Cove, Nevada]]. He tried to get authorization to build a subdivision on the land. The [[Tahoe Regional Planning Agency]] did not approve the subdivision plans. They sued Newton and won, stopping Newton's plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tahoedailytribune.com/news/castle-constructed-near-zephyr-cove/ |title=Out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy |publisher=tahoedailytribune.com |access-date=2019-05-19}}</ref>

In 1992, Newton filed for [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] [[Bankruptcy in the United States|bankruptcy]] to reorganize an estimated $20 million in debts, much of which was accumulated while suing NBC for libel; he claimed the network had reported that he partnered with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] to buy the Aladdin. His bankruptcy declaration included a $341,000 [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[tax lien]]. By 1999, he was financially well off again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwaytovegas.com/October31,1999.html |title=Out of Chapter 11 bankruptcy |publisher=Broadwaytovegas.com |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>

In August 2005, the IRS filed a lawsuit against Newton alleging that he and his wife owed more than $1.8 million in taxes and penalties. One of Newton's tax lawyers disputed that, saying, "We believe the IRS owes him money."<ref name="reviewjournal">{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Aug-02-Tue-2005/news/26981975.html |title=2005 – IRS alleges Wayne Newton owes $1.8 million |publisher=Reviewjournal.com |date=2005-08-02 |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>

In late 2009, officials at [[Oakland County International Airport]] in Waterford, Michigan, claimed Newton owed the airport more than $60,000 for unpaid parking fees, which they claimed he owed after having abandoned a $2 million [[Fokker F28]] plane there more than three years before.<ref name="reviewjournal" /> The plane was originally flown in for renovations in 2005. After they were completed in 2007, the plane was moved to an outside parking area. The monthly parking fees were $5,000.

In 2009, it was discovered that the interior of the craft was rotting, and filled with mold.<ref>The Detroit Free Press, February 5, 2010, page 8A</ref> The plane has since been disassembled, transported, and reassembled on his estate grounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/08/27/wayne-newton-abandoned-jet-return-las-vegas/ |title=Wayne Newton – Park My Jet On My Lawn |publisher=TMZ.com |access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>

In a 2009 lawsuit, Newton was accused of failing to pay $32,384 for hay delivered to his Las Vegas ranch, presumably for consumption by his horses at the ranch. As of February 27, 2010, the lawsuit was still pending in Clark County District Court, with Newton and his attorneys having filed no response in court.<ref name="sun">{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/25/moving-vans-seen-wayne-newtons-las-vegas-home/|title=Officers denied entry at Wayne Newton's Las Vegas home|last=Green|first=Steve|date=2010-02-25|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|access-date=2010-07-25}}</ref>

In another 2009 lawsuit, he was accused of owing GMAC $36,999 for a lease on a Cadillac. The suit was ultimately dropped.<ref name="sun" />

In February 2010, [[Bruton Smith]] sued Newton, claiming he was delinquent on a loan he had personally guaranteed, then bought from [[Bank of America]]. Smith sought [[foreclosure]] of Newton's Las Vegas ranch Casa de Shenandoah.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/17/former-friend-seeks-foreclose-singer-wayne-newtons/|title=2010 Former friend seeks to foreclose on singer Wayne Newton's home|date=February 17, 2010|publisher=Las Vegas Sun|access-date=2011-02-12}}</ref>

Also in February 2010, Clark County sheriff's deputies and a fleet of moving vans were refused entry to Newton's ranch at E. Sunset and S. Pecos roads. The officers attempted to serve civil papers and seize property as part of a $501,388 judgment against Newton awarded to Monty Ward, his former personal pilot, but security personnel employed by Newton refused to accept the papers. Ward, who filed suit in 2006, won the judgment for past-due wages in January 2009 and since then had attempted to determine the wages of Newton when he performed at the MGM Grand and later the Tropicana hotel-casino. As of January 27, 2010, the value of the judgment was reportedly increasing by $126.86 per day.<ref name="sun" />

Newton was enmeshed in another lawsuit over a stalled project to convert his 40-acre home into a museum. In this lawsuit, a developer claimed he purchased Newton's home and paid the singer $19.5 million, with the understanding that Newton would move out and allow the property to be converted into a museum. The developer claimed that he had invested $50 million on the project, but that Newton had failed to move out and had deliberately thwarted construction efforts, including by sexually harassing construction workers.<ref>Farnham, Alan. abcnews.go.com, [https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wayne-newton-sued-stalled-museum/story?id=16405728#.ULMHV-Oe_Dk/ "Wayne Newton Battles Ugly Lawsuit Over 'Graceland West'"], May 23, 2012.

On December 17, 2012, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Bruce Markell approved the sale of Wayne Newton's estate, Casa de Shenandoah, to be listed for sale by Nathan and Associates, a Las Vegas brokerage firm. Bankruptcy papers placed the value of the property at $50.8 million.<ref>O'Reiley, Tim.
