A '''trailer park''' or '''caravan park''' is a temporary  or permanent area for [[mobile homes]] and [[travel trailers]]. Advantages include low cost compared to other housing, and quick and easy moving to a new area (for example, when taking a job in a distant place while keeping the same home).

Trailer parks, especially in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], are stereotypically viewed as [[Affordable housing|lower income housing]] for occupants living at or below the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] who have low social status.<ref name="strongtowns">{{Cite web|url=https://www.strongtowns.org/journal/2016/8/11/reclaiming-redneck-urbanism-what-urban-planners-can-learn-from-trailer-parks|title=Reclaiming "Redneck" Urbanism: What Urban Planners can Learn from Trailer Parks|first=Nolan|last=Gray|date=August 12, 2016|website=Strong Towns|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref><ref name="theguardian">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/03/owning-trailer-parks-mobile-home-university-investment|title=America's trailer parks: the residents may be poor but the owners are getting rich|first=Rupert|last=Neate|date=May 3, 2015|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref><ref name="ft">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/3c87eb24-47a8-11ea-aee2-9ddbdc86190d|title=Why big investors are buying up American trailer parks|first=Rana|last=Foroohar|date=February 7, 2020|website=[[Financial Times]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref><ref name="bloomberg">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-25/why-trailer-parks-hinder-the-american-dream|title=How Mobile Homes Hinder the American Dream|first=Mimi|last=Kirk|date=October 25, 2017|website=[[Bloomberg News]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref> Despite the advances in trailer home technology, the trailer park image survives as evoked by a statement from Presidential adviser [[James Carville]] who, in the course of one of the [[Bill Clinton]] [[White House]] political scandals, suggested "Drag $100 bills through trailer parks, there's no telling what you'll find," in reference to [[Paula Jones]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,985789,00.html|title=WILL SHE HAVE HER DAY IN COURT ?|first=Adam|last=Cohen|date=January 20, 1997|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref> 

[[Tornado]]es and [[Tropical cyclone|hurricane]]s often inflict serious damage on trailer parks, usually because the structures are not secured to the ground and their construction is significantly less able to withstand high wind forces than regular houses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/weather/hurricane/article172419632.html|title=Hurricane Irma rips roofs from mobile homes|first=Monique O.|last=Madan|date=September 10, 2017|website=[[Miami Herald]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/09/12/florida-has-828000-mobile-homes-only-half-are-insured/|title=Florida has 828,000 mobile homes.

The negative perception of trailer parks was not improved by the creation of emergency trailer parks by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) for the displaced victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]], the quality and temporary nature of which was disputed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/12/us/nationalspecial/12exile.html|title=Road to New Life After Katrina Is Closed to Many|first=Shaila|last=Dewan|date=July 12, 2007|website=[[The New York Times]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref>

Many stereotypes have been developed regarding people who live in trailer parks, which are similar to [[stereotype]]s of the poor and the term ''[[trailer trash]]'' is often used as an adjective in the same vein as the derogatory American terms ''[[white trash]]'' or ''[[ghetto]]''.<ref>{{cite book | title=Class and News | publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-7425-2713-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=edtUWDk4FWcC&pg=PA213 | access-date=January 4, 2020 | pages=213–214}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timeline.com/history-trailer-part-mobile-home-poverty-74bb8a7c44be|title=Downwardly mobile: how trailer living became an inescapable marker of class|first=Nina Renata|last=Aaron|date=March 13, 2018|website=Timeline|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref> Though trailer parks appear throughout the United States, they are often associated with the [[Deep South]] and rural areas. Trailer parks became viewed as a valuable asset in the late 2010s. During that decade, REITs, private equity funds, and middle-class people looking to escape the corporate world bought them up from small mom-and-pop owners.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Particle or Wave: On Esther Sullivan’s "Manufactured Insecurity"|url=https://www.clereviewofbooks.com/home/esther-sullivan-manufactured-insecurity-review|access-date=2021-11-23|website=Cleveland Review of Books|language=en-US}}</ref>

More recently referred to in the U.S. as "mobile home parks" or "[[manufactured housing]] communities", the stereotypes are often just that.<ref name="ft"/> [[Retirement communities]] exist in many locales that permit mobile home parks as "55+ parks" in keeping with the [[Housing for Older Persons Act]] (HOPA). Generally, at least one homeowner in these communities must be age 55 or over, and those under age 18 are rarely permitted to live there. These can be [[gated community|gated communities]] with amenities, such as [[swimming pool]]s, [[community center|clubhouse]]s and onsite maintenance. Homes are often permanently installed on foundations, however, in certain circumstances, residents may not own the land their homes occupy.

====Corporate investment====
Mobile home parks in the U.S. have become an attractive investment for large financial firms, such as [[The Carlyle Group|Carlyle Group]], [[Apollo Global Management]] and [[TPG Capital]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-billion-dollar-empire-made-of-mobile-homes/2019/02/14/ac687342-2b0b-11e9-b2fc-721718903bfc_story.html|title=A billion-dollar empire made of mobile homes|last=Whoriskey|first=Peter|date=February 14, 2019|website=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref><ref name="ft"/><ref name="theguardian"/> Over 100,000 US mobile home sites were estimated to be owned by large firms in 2019.<ref name=":0" /> One firm, [[Stockbridge Capital Group]], owner of about 200 mobile-home parks throughout the US "saw a return on investment of more than 30 percent between late 2016 and the end of 2017."<ref name=":0" /> The company's expansion into this market was facilitated by $1.3 billion in financing from [[Fannie Mae]], which has called mobile homes "inherently affordable."<ref name=":0" /> Profitability for the firms owning the parks has in some cases been tied to rent increases, and has not necessarily translated into good maintenance of the mobile homes.<ref name=":0" />

==== Disputed trailer parks====
[[File:Traveller Pride mural, St. Margaret’s Park, Ballymun.jpg|thumb|TRAVELLER PRIDE - mural located at the entrance to the authorised [[Halting site]] of St. Margaret’s Park in [[Ballymun]] ]]
In Britain and Ireland, the term [[halting site]] is used in place of trailer parks. The biggest difference in Europe is the presence of unauthorised halting sites (or trailer parks). This stems from the practice of traditionally itinerant ethnic groups, such as the [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Irish Travellers]], to periodically during the year set up a transient community. From the late 1970s onward there was also a growth in [[New Age travelers]] culture; these groups espoused alternative lifestyles combined with a Do-It-Yourself punk ethic. The latter were a commonplace phenomenon in Germany,<ref>{{cite book | title=Cool Places: Geographies of Youth Cultures | publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-4151-4920-4| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rizRuQEACAAJ | access-date=February 18, 2021 | pages=289}}</ref> giving rise to expressions such as ''Wagenburg'', ''Wagendorf'', and ''Bauwagenplatz'' ("[[wagon fort]]", "trailer village" and "construction trailer site" respectively).

Either rejected from or refusing to seek entrance in municipally authorised halting sites, groups of families practising a nomadic lifestyle would establish themselves under the cover of darkness on idle land near urban centers. These unauthorised encampments were often resented by local people, perpetuating a cycle of violence, fear and discrimination. The use of land without the necessary permission also carried the threat of imprisonment for the squatting families, further worsening the socio-economic disadvantage experienced by these minorities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30954709.html|title=Traveller couples given 24 hours to move away from vicinity of illegal halting site|first=Aodhan|last=O’Faolain|date=October 3, 2019|website=[[Irish Examiner]]|language=en-US|access-date=February 18, 2021}}</ref>

====Authorised caravan parks====
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2021}}
In Germany, the Netherlands and some other European countries, local law allows for normal camping at [[RV park]]s for a short time and seasonal camping for holiday makers, and also long-time camping (for years) with hardly movable travel trailers. Sometimes the inhabitants also cultivate a [[Allotment (gardening)#United Kingdom|garden]]. Some cities allow a long-time camping lot to be the regular address registered with the authorities; others do not. Many of mobile home plots are offered by [[RV park]]s that allow for all sorts of camping and offer extra plots for mobile homes (static caravans).The cost for such a plot tends to be between 400 € and 1.500 € a year, depending on the location and facilities.

In France, living in a trailer or mobile home for more than three months is prohibited by law, even if the resident owns the land; however, building requirements and permissions for self building of recreational solid (static) country cottages are more relaxed in France if one stays within a certain amount of square meters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In the United Kingdom, "trailers" are commonly known as static caravans, and are generally used for one of two purposes:  firstly as holiday homes, designed for short-term living; and secondly as retirement homes for the elderly, designed for long-term occupancy. Both types of trailers usually enjoy good amenities and are surrounded by highly manicured gardens.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In [[Australia]], there is generally no differentiation between a trailer park and an [[RV park]]. The term "caravan park" is used to refer to both.

In New Zealand, the suburb of [[Favona]] in [[Auckland]] is an area where trailer parks are concentrated.
