'''Laura Beatrice Marling''' (born 1 February 1990) is a British [[Folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter. She won the [[Brit Award]] for [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best British Female Solo Artist]] at the [[2011 Brit Awards]] and was nominated for the same award at the [[2012 Brit Awards|2012]], [[2014 Brit Awards|2014]], [[2016 Brit Awards|2016]], and [[2018 Brit Awards]].

Marling joined her older sisters in London at age 16 to pursue a career in music. She played with a number of groups and released her debut album, ''[[Alas, I Cannot Swim]]'', in 2008. Her first album, her second album ''[[I Speak Because I Can]]'', her fourth album ''[[Once I Was an Eagle]]'', and her seventh album ''[[Song for Our Daughter]]'' were nominated for the [[Mercury Music Prize]] in 2008, 2010, 2013, and 2020, respectively. Her sixth record, ''[[Semper Femina]]'', was also nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in the [[Best Folk Album]] category, as was ''Song for Our Daughter''.

Her songwriting is associated with sex and relationships, the modern concept of womanhood and trauma.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/apr/09/laura-marling-song-for-our-daughter-album-review |website=The Guardian |access-date=3 October 2021}}</ref>

===2012–2013: ''Once I Was an Eagle''===
During October 2012, Marling completed the 'Working Holiday Tour' of the US as a solo performer. At the time, she announced that the fourth album, later named ''[[Once I Was an Eagle]]'', was finished and was scheduled for a February 2013 release;<ref>{{cite web|title=Laura Marling unveils new material on US solo tour|url=https://www.nme.com/news/laura-marling/66544|work=[[NME]]|publisher=IPC Media Entertainment Network|access-date=3 July 2013|author=Richard Johnson|date=9 October 2012}}</ref> this was later delayed until May 2013.

Following the release of the album, Marling revealed that she only listened to "music made between 1969 and 1972" during the songwriting process for the album and described it as an era when "guitar was becoming a kind of masculine extension". Marling explained during the post-release promotional period that she sought a minimalist approach for the fourth album and, in contrast to the previous two albums, recorded all of the songs without a band.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Valish|first=Frank|date=23 October 2013|title=Laura Marling: The Master Interview|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/laura_marling/|access-date=14 October 2014|website=[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under The Radar]]}}</ref><ref name="Neil" />

Marling revealed in a September 2013 interview that she had enough songs for a fifth album at the time, and she will "maybe make this record and then have a big, long, hard think about what I've done". During a February 2014 performance for [[NPR]]'s "[[eTown]]" series, Marling played one of the new songs, titled "Born to Love".<ref name="Neil">{{cite news|author1=McCormick|first=Neil|date=25 September 2013|title=Mercury Music Prize 2013: Laura Marling, interview|work=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/10331832/Mercury-Music-Prize-2013-Laura-Marling-interview.html|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=13 February 2014|title=WATCH: Laura Marling performs new track|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/WATCH--Laura-Marling-performs-new-track/10993441.html|access-date=14 October 2014|website=[[Hot Press]]}}</ref>

During a European tour for her fourth album, Marling expressed doubts about her long-term commitment to the music industry in an interview:

<blockquote>When I play, I am very much in the space where I was when I wrote the music. You could slay me quite easily, I'm at my most vulnerable. I am very private, in all aspects of my life, to everybody, so why is it that I get up on stage every night and open myself in front of strangers? I'm not sure if I've got the bottle for it, any more.<ref name="Neil" /></blockquote>

Marling added that she is sometimes surprised by her profession in relation to the music industry as a whole and often thinks, "oh, I exist in this industry" when listening to the radio, saying that she is unsure if she wants to remain in such a position.<ref name="Neil" />

===2014–2017: ''Short Movie'' and ''Semper Femina''===
[[File:Laura Marling - First Avenue - 5 5 17 (34106214720).jpg|thumb|Marling in 2017]]
On 16 December 2014, Marling announced that her fifth studio album would be titled ''[[Short Movie]]''. The album's title track, released on the same date, is the lead single and was made available for digital download. The album features 13 songs composed by Marling and was released in the UK on 23 March 2015 and one day later in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/short-movie/id947828754|title=iTunes – Music – Short Movie by Laura Marling|work=iTunes|access-date=20 March 2015}}</ref>

Marling began recording songs for the album shortly after completing the solo tour for ''Once I Was an Eagle''. The songs were written in the US, reflecting Marling's experience of living in Los Angeles. However, after recording a new album, she felt unsatisfied with the result, and made the decision to scrap most of the songs written in that period. During this time, she became involved in activities unrelated to music. When production later resumed, she completed the album with her band at Urchin Studios in London. Marling produced the album alongside Dan Cox and Matt Ingram.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/dec/17/laura-marling-announces-new-album-short-movie-hear-the-title-track |title=Laura Marling announces new album Short Movie|newspaper=The Guardian |date=17 December 2014 |access-date=29 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lauramarling.com/bio/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223042542/http://www.lauramarling.com/bio/|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 December 2014|title=Laura Marling "Short Movie" bio|newspaper=The Guardian|date=17 December 2014|access-date=29 December 2014}}</ref>
