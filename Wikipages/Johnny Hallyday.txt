On ''Je suis né dans la rue'', Hallyday hired both [[Peter Frampton]] and the [[Small Faces]] and they all play on most of the tracks on the album. [[Steve Marriott]] and [[Ronnie Lane]] of the Small Faces contributed their compositions "Amen (Bang Bang)", "Reclamation (News Report)", and "Regarde pour moi (What You Will)" to the album. "Amen" is a French language variation on "That Man", a previously-released 1967 Small Faces song played in a heavy rock style. Tensions between the Small Faces during the recording sessions led to Marriott leaving the band and forming [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]] with Frampton, and rearranged English language versions of both "Reclamation (News Report)" and "Regarde pour moi (What You Will)" appeared on Humble Pie's debut LP of 1969.

In February 2018 his two oldest children, David and Laura, announced that they were contesting his will, which left his entire estate to his last wife Læticia and their two adopted children. The will was drafted in California, and their lawyers contend that it violates French laws which prevent children from being disinherited.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-43032314|title=Johnny Hallyday's children contest exclusion from his will|access-date=12 February 2018|publisher=BBC|date=12 February 2018}}</ref>
