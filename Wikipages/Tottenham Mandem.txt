== History ==

=== Origins: 1970s–90s ===
TMD, like many other London gangs such as the [[Peckham Boys]] and [[Ghetto Boys]], has its origins in the 1970s, and was founded in Broadwater Farm, Tottenham. By the time of the infamous [[Broadwater Farm riot]] in 1985, the gang was firmly established in the area.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-inquest-final-moments-of-man-who-sparked-london-riots-revealed-8822027.html|title=Mark Duggan inquest: Final moments of man who sparked London riots|date=2013-09-17|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808144239/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/mark-duggan-inquest-final-moments-of-man-who-sparked-london-riots-revealed-8822027.html|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/mark-duggan-family-in-plea-not-146450|title=Mark Duggan family in plea not to use his death as excuse to riot|last=Gregory|first=Andrew|date=2011-08-07|website=mirror|access-date=2019-08-08}}</ref> The gang is a derivative of another local gang known as the Broadwater Farm Posse, formed in the 1970s by Black British youth of [[West Indian]] origins.

=== 1990s: rise of Mark Lambie ===
By the early 1990s, TMD was one of the largest gangs in North East London, controlling many of the drug markets in the area.<ref name=":4" /> One leader<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gDiKAgAAQBAJ&q=%22TMD%22&pg=PT72|title=Guns and Gangs: The Inside Story of the War on our Streets|last=McLagan|first=Graeme|date=2013-09-19|publisher=Allison & Busby|isbn=9780749015886|language=en}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/prince-of-darkness-jailed-for-12-years-1-952126|title='Prince of Darkness' jailed for 12 years|website=The Scotsman|language=en|access-date=2019-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808144223/https://www.scotsman.com/news/uk-news/prince-of-darkness-jailed-for-12-years-1-952126|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> of TMD, Mark Lambie (also known as "Devil Man", "[[Obeah]] Man", or the "Prince of Darkness"<ref name="beeb1" /><ref name=":8"/>), was a suspect in the murder of PC [[Keith Blakelock]] during the Broadwater Farm Riot.<ref name="beeb1" /> Lambie helped forge links and alliances with gangs across London and beyond. In 1991, he was sentenced to 3 and a half years in jail due to involvement in a gang shooting, although this was reduced a year. In 1995, police intelligence reports indicated he had been fraternizing with gang members from [[Brent, London|Brent]] and [[Notting Hill]]. He also had a feud with Jerome Maddix, who had experienced a drive-by shooting at his home and was murdered a year later in Jamaica.<ref name=":3" />

In 1996, police believed Mark and an associate, Clifford Angol, may have been involved in the non-fatal shooting of Kenneth Wowe in West London. The following year, three gunmen entered a Caribbean restaurant in West London called The Place To Be and asked to see Mark. While it is suspected Mark Lambie was there at the time, he kept quiet if he was. Instead two innocent Marks were shot after identifying themselves.<ref name="auto1"/> Police suspected this may have been an attempted retaliation shooting following the shooting of Kenneth Wowe. Six months later, Kenneth Wowe was shot dead. Mark and Clifford were promptly arrested, but let go due to lack of evidence. A few days later, Clifford Angol was shot dead.<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qFGHkAPfHhEC&q=%22clifford-angol%22&pg=PA373|title=Policing Notting Hill: Fifty Years of Turbulence|last=Moore|first=Tony|date=2013|publisher=Waterside Press|isbn=9781904380610|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5" />

In 1999, a man was shot in Colosseum nightclub in [[Vauxhall]]. The victim named Mark Lambie as the shooter, who was then arrested, but once again was let go after the victim withdrew his evidence. In the same year, police believed he and an associate, Michael Thomas (aka Mallet), had shot at an EQ nightclub in Hackney Marsh. Police suspected this was a form of blackmail. There was a third incident at a Hackney club where Stephen Grant was shot dead. Police suspected this was a part of the TMD and Hackney Boys dispute. Lambie was suspected of being at the club.<ref name=":3" />

=== 2000–2002: Fall of Mark Lambie ===
By 2000, Mark Lambie was considered untouchable by the local black community. Some people in the local community believed he was capable of [[juju]] powers and was untouchable due to magic. This earned him the nickname "[[Obeah]] Man", named after an African spiritual system.<ref name=":3" /><ref name="beeb1" /><ref name=":5" /><ref name=":8"/> He was top of [[Operation Trident (Metropolitan Police)|Operation Trident]]'s wanted list due to the close links he had built with gangs in [[Wembley]], [[Harlesden]] in Brent, and south London.<ref name="gruniad" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5" /> While Trident struggled to find evidence to convict Lambie, they managed to convict two of his associates, Michael Thomas (aka Mallet) and Ricky Sweeney.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":9">{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1381992/Mother-who-defied-gangster-is-bravest-woman-in-Britain.html|title=Mother who defied gangster is 'bravest woman in Britain'|last=Correspondent|first=John Steele Crime|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2002-01-19|access-date=2019-08-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808144226/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1381992/Mother-who-defied-gangster-is-bravest-woman-in-Britain.html|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In order to prevent his girlfriend from testifying against him, Ricky Sweeney had her shot.

Instead police used similar tactics American police used when going after [[Al Capone]], by going after his associates. Police also found that Mark was living in South London, rather than North as was expected, and that he was using false names, such as 'Paul Gordan'. Eventually they managed to find him and his brother, Wesley Lambie, in a car that was suspected to be stolen (although the owner refused to testify it was). They also found heroin in the car, but were unable to link it to the Lambie brothers. Although they were unable to bring charges, knowing where he was made surveillance now a possibility.<ref name=":3" />

In 2002, Mark Lambie, along with Anthony "Blue" Bourne (member of the North London gang "The Firm"), were jailed after the kidnapping, blackmailing, and torture of two men, Mr. Smith and Mr. Morris, from Tottenham on 21 April 2001. The police had been following Lambie around Tottenham on the day, and saw him enter and leave Broadwater Estate. It was considered too risky to enter the Estate, so they waited outside until Mark left, and followed him to a party. Nothing eventful happened, so they returned to the police station.<ref name=":3" /> What they didn't know, is that an associate of Mark, Anthony Bourne, had lured two men into Broadwater Estate, where they were kidnapped at gunpoint by at least 14 people. The two men had driven a blue sports car into the estate, which the police had spotted earlier as they were following Mark. The group took the two men into a house, which they burst into and ordered the current occupants (two women and two children) to move downstairs, and then began to torture the two men, demanding money from them both. The house they had entered was the same house the police had seen Mark enter earlier in the day, which the police had interpreted to be a party.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name="beeb1" /><ref name="gruniad" /><ref name=":10" />

They were hit with hammers, burned with an electric iron, and had boiling water poured onto their genitals. One of the victims, Mr. Smith, was able to escape after suggesting there was money at a nearby salon. He was bundled into a car, and driven to the salon, which was promptly robbed while the Mr. Smith was secured in the boot of the car.

=== Fragmentation and development ===
The early 2000s saw a decline in TMD. Tottenham became less unified and local independent gangs propped up. Meanwhile, members of NorthStar pursued their careers in music. Killings also dropped during this period, but the rivalries continued through music with rival groups sending disses towards each other (such as Mash Town from [[London Fields]]).<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" />

Some of the Tottenham split-offs from TMD were Ida Boys, NPK (Northumberland Park Killers<ref name=":29" />), Chestnut Estate (CE, also known as Black Gang),<ref name=":19" /> and Tiverton Mandem. 'Star Gang' also formed during this period, created by older members of TMD.<ref name=":23" /> The name 'Star Gang' was allegedly influenced by "North Star", the music group setup by former TMD members during the early 2000s. Some of the younger members of TMD had begun to associate with the London [[Bloods]] movement and began calling themselves Ida Boys (also known as Ida Rydaz, Ida Bloodstarz, or IDA<ref name=":20" />), Bloodline<ref name=":22" /> or Bloodgang, and BWF (Broadwater Farm).<ref name=":23" />

Some groups still referred to themselves as the "Tottenham Mandem" regardless, but the term no longer referred to a specific gang.<ref name=":4" /> Collectively, some of the fragmentations were all known as "Farm Mandem" (FMD), and they still had links to older TMD members.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":24" />

Some of these groups, such as Star Gang,<ref name=":25">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/mark-duggan-profile-tottenham-shooting|title=Mark Duggan: profile of Tottenham police shooting victim|last1=Barkham|first1=Patrick|date=2011-08-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-08-09|last2=Henley|first2=Jon|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190724231119/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/aug/08/mark-duggan-profile-tottenham-shooting|archive-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> became active in the [[road rap]] scene at the time.

In the mid-late 2000s, members of TMD became associated with the [[Ghetto Boys]], a gang based in South London. Younger members of the Ghetto Boys had formed "Shower". Together, members of TMD and the Ghetto Boys called themselves "Shower Syndicate". It is alleged the group had links with the Jamaican gang [[Shower Posse]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/londonstreetgangs/gang-lists/south-london-gangs/uk-shower-syndicate|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517052950/http://sites.google.com/site/londonstreetgangs/gang-lists/south-london-gangs/uk-shower-syndicate|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-05-17|title=UK Shower Syndicate - www.londonstreetgangs.com|date=2012-05-17|access-date=2019-08-07}}</ref> In 2009, two members of TMD were giving life sentences after murdering someone in South London.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8301601/Britains-most-notorious-gangs.html|title=Britain's most notorious gangs|last=Collins|first=Nick|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=2011-02-04|access-date=2019-08-08|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808144225/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8301601/Britains-most-notorious-gangs.html|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":7" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thetottenhamindependent.co.uk/news/4423103.tottenham-gangsters-jailed-for-nightclub-shooting/|title=Tottenham gangsters jailed for nightclub shooting|website=Tottenham Independent|language=en|access-date=2019-08-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190808144228/https://www.thetottenhamindependent.co.uk/news/4423103.tottenham-gangsters-jailed-for-nightclub-shooting/|archive-date=8 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
