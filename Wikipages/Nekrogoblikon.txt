On his return to school at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], Lyakhovetskiy found Ashleigh Carracino, Alex Duddy, Spencer Bartz, Alex Alereza, and Austin Nickel to form the rest of the band. The group played eleven shows before Bartz moved to Japan, and was replaced by Eddie Trager.<ref name=sbindependent>{{cite web|title=Nekrogoblikon|url=http://www.independent.com/bands/nekrogoblikon/|publisher=Santa Barbara Independent}}</ref>
