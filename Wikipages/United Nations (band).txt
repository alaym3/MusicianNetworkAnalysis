}}'''United Nations''' is a [[hardcore punk]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] whose roots go back to at least 2005. Due to the nature of the band, it is unclear who exactly is a member of United Nations at any given time. Early promotional images of the band depicted four people wearing [[Ronald Reagan]] masks, and all original contributors were contractually obligated to remain anonymous. The only member not under contract at the time was [[Geoff Rickly]] of the band [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]].

==History==

=== Formation and early recording sessions (2005–2008){{efn|Rickly has revealed that in the early days of the band, they had "a deliberate disinformation campaign" where they gave different and contradictory information in interviews.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=http://beatroute.ca/2014/11/03/united-nations-laugh-or-cry-it-doesnt-matter-were-all-fucked/|title=United Nations: Laugh or cry, it doesn't matter… we're all fucked|date=2014-11-03|website=BeatRoute Magazine|access-date=2017-06-24}}</ref> This means a lot of early information of the band may be unreliable. }} ===

In 2008, the band claimed to have recorded enough material for two studio albums, two extended plays that would be released at some point. The band was uncertain if these would be the only releases by the band, or if the band will regroup to record more songs.<ref name="altpress-rickly-interview2" />

=== Debut album and EP (2008–2010) ===
United Nations released their [[United Nations (United Nations album)|self-titled debut]] on September 9, 2008, through [[Eyeball Records]].  The band was ready to release the album with essentially the same photo cover for the iconic cover of [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'', with the exception of The Beatles engulfed in flames and walking to the left rather than the right. When stores began refusing to sell the album, pressing was halted with 1,000 albums already made. These were sold exclusively through the Eyeball Records webstore,<ref name="rickly-mtv2" /> and it was later released with a different cover. The album received minor success and while it didn't chart on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], it did chart at number 44 on the Billboard [[Independent Albums]] and number 14 on the Billboard [[Top Heatseekers]].<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=united nations|chart=all}} "Artist Chart History - United Nations"] ''Billboard.com''.

On their self-titled debut album, the song titled "The Shape of Punk that Never Came" pays tribute to Refused's album ''[[The Shape of Punk to Come]]'' – most notably in the lyric "Dennis, are you listening? Is there something that I'm missing?" which is directed toward [[Dennis Lyxzén]], the lead singer of Refused.

United Nations was inspired by bands that "raised questions about political corruption, social inequity, personal responsibility and artistic freedom"<ref name="headbangersblog" /> in opposition to bands that are more concerned with pop culture. Geoff Rickly commented on his vision for the band:{{cquote

|''To me, it was like, maybe speaking sincerely about things isn't enough to make people pay attention. Maybe you have to make fun of people — and be a mirror — to show them how stupid they look, to get their attention. That's the idea. Punk is just way too safe these days, so we're hoping by making some audacious claims and doing some strange things and breaking a few laws, we can get people to think at least. It's the idea that you need to embrace the absurdity or it will fucking kill you. The world doesn't make sense, and trying to make sense of it is a fool's errand.''}}

== "Disinformation campaign" ==
Rickly has said “...in the beginning we had a deliberate disinformation campaign. I mean we tried to give different and contradictory information in almost every interview we did".<ref name=":9" />

=== List of false information ===
* Rickly has said the band planned to release a [[Kidz Bop]] style album, titled ''United Nations Plays Pretty for a Bunch of Fucking Babies''.<ref name="altpress-rickly-interview2" /> The album's title was a parody of [[Nation of Ulysses]]' album ''[[Plays Pretty for Baby]]''. In a 2014 interview Rickly confirmed this as fake.<ref name=":9" /> It is unclear if other announced albums such as ''The Dark Side of the UN'' are also fake. 
* The band has claimed comedian [[Kristen Schaal]] wrote lyrics for the band.<ref name="headbangersblog" /> In a 2014 interview Rickly said “I had people asking what Kristen Schaal was like, and stuff like that. In the end seeing what kinds of things people believed so easily got kind of frustrating and sad.”<ref name=":9" />

== Controversies ==

=== Debut cover art ===
Before its release, stores refused to sell the band's debut self-titled album because of trademark issues. As a result, only 1,000 copies were made with the controversial cover, and later copies were made with an alternative cover. The one thousand original copies were sold exclusively through the band and [[Eyeball Records]].

=== Band name ===
The international organization, [[United Nations]], after which the band is named, discovered that a musical group had formed under the name of United Nations, and ordered [[Facebook]] to remove their official page.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_5069|title=United Nations Facebook page shut down by the real U.N. - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|language=en|access-date=2017-06-25|date=2008-11-10}}</ref> After deleting their page, Facebook informed the band about the removal and also stated, "The use of the name 'United Nations' by the Band and the use of its Logo which resembles the UN emblem has not been authorized and violates international and United States laws..."<ref>Tate, Jason.

[http://altpress.com/news/5069.htm "UNITED NATIONS FACEBOOK PAGE SHUT DOWN BY THE REAL U.N."] ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''. Retrieved on November 11, 2008.</ref> Their label also hinted at the possibility of no longer being able to release their debut album. In December 2008, a little over a month after the band's Facebook was deleted, their [[MySpace]] page was also deleted.<ref>Tate, Jason. [http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=758472 "They Can Keep Their AP Profile."] ''AbsolutePunk.net''. Retrieved on December 23, 2008.</ref>

== Members ==
Due to the nature of the band, it is unclear who exactly is a member of United Nations at any given time. Early promotional images of the band depicted four people wearing [[Ronald Reagan]] masks, and all contributors were contractually obligated to remain anonymous.<ref name="synblog2" /> The only member not under contract was [[Geoff Rickly]] of the band [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]], for press and media purposes. However, Jonah Bayer and Lukas Previn later became publicly announced members of United Nations as well. Many sources claim that [[Daryl Palumbo]], [[Ben Koller]], and also members of various bands signed to [[Eyeball Records]] contributed to United Nations.<ref>Kaufman, Jared. [http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=208283 "United Nations (feat. Rickley and Palumbo) To Release Album"] ''AbsolutePunk.net''. Retrieved on January 16, 2009.</ref> The cease-and-desist letter sent to the band by the actual United Nations to Facebook to remove the band's profile listed approximately 30 people who the government entity suspected as being band members at the time.

In a 2013 interview with Rickly, he elaborated on the revolving line-up of United Nations, stating: "The reason that we've been able to kind of get away with playing when we want to is because we change members and because we've never copyrighted any of the songs to any member. So, it's really hard to say who made what and who was just playing [in United Nations] for a little while. That's something that has protected us — the anonymity of the band, the changing nature of the band — it's like, 'Well i was only in it for a little while, and then it was these guys, and then it was these guys, and then it was these guys...'"<ref name="APTV-2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/aptv/video/reporting_from_fest_12_interview_with_united_nations|title=Reporting from Fest 12: Interview with United Nations|last=Whitt|first=Cassie|date=November 3, 2013|work=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=June 24, 2014}}</ref> In the same interview, managing editor of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' Scott Heisel asked Rickly if, because he is the only well-known member of United Nations, he was afraid of taking the full blame for any of the band's controversial or potentially illegal activity. He responded: "I don't feel like many bands take chances anymore. There's a lot of talk about being punk and revolutionary and this and that, but it's also awfully safe — punk seems awfully safe to me now, so I like the idea of doing something that's actually dangerous."<ref name="APTV-2013" />
