==History==

=== Formation, Los Tinellers and Aventura ===
In 1993, Lenny Santos and his brother Max Santos formed Los Tinallers. Lenny and Max were looking for a singer who could help them take their music career more serious. Lenny didn't know anybody in their neighborhood who could sing. He was later introduced to Anthony Santos via one of the group's musicians named Roney Fernandez who attended the same school as Anthony. They clicked instantly, and the two started working on songs together. Anthony was a singer and composer who would sing with his cousin Henry at their local church choir. Anthony later introduces Lenny to his cousin Henry, who also joins the group. The group would perform for their neighbors, at local stores and in the streets for free in the [[The Bronx|Bronx]]. The group decided to change the name to Los Tinellers, a play on the word teenager.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/aventura-hits-lady-gaga-park-headlining-4-msg-shows-article-1.457611|title=Aventura hits Lady Gaga out of the park, headlining 4 MSG shows - who are they?|last=Farber|first=Jim|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> The group consisted of lead members Lenny and Anthony.

In 1995, the group was discovered by Elvin Polanco when Lenny and Anthony asked him if they could perform at a local parade he was hosting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://listindiario.com/entretenimiento/2016/11/07/442117/a-20-anos-del-primer-album-de-aventura|title=A 20 años del primer álbum de Aventura|last=Diario|first=Listin|date=2016-11-07|website=listindiario.com|language=ES|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Elvin, seeing potential in the group, became their manager. He helped them record their first studio album despite having no funds. They released their debut album in 1995 titled "Trampa de Amor" under Elca Productions. The album did not do well commercially, selling a total of five copies. Elvin Polanco ran into some health problems and the group was left without a manager at that time.

In 1996, with the help of new manager Julio César García, the group created a new image. Julio added Henry and Max as lead members. He made the group to resemble popular American boy bands. He renamed the group to Aventura. They signed a record deal with Premium Latin Music, Inc. They made their big break in 1999, with the hopes of breaking bachata music into the mainstream from its traditional base.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latintrends.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-aventura/|title=What You Didn’t Know about Aventura – LatinTRENDS.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> They slowly began to gather fans in the cities of [[Boston]] and [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]]. The group was the first to experiment with bachata by fusing the genre with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop & rap]], [[reggae]] and [[Rock music|rock]]. Aventura broke bachata rules. They were the first bachata act to sing a whole bachata song in English. Anthony innovated bachata with fresh lyrics that incorporated songs with different themes, instead of just singing about heartbreak.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/aventura-hits-lady-gaga-park-headlining-4-msg-shows-article-1.457611|title=Aventura hits Lady Gaga out of the park, headlining 4 MSG shows - who are they?|last=Farber|first=Jim|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> Lenny innovated bachata guitar with his use of electric guitars. He also innovated the tone of bachata guitar by adding guitar effects such as wah, phaser, distortion, tremolo and harmonizer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.guitarplayer.com/miscellaneous/aventuras-lenny-santos|title=Aventura's Lenny Santos|last=Mark.C.Davis|website=GuitarPlayer.com|language=en-us|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> Max innovated the bachata bass with his use of bass techniques such as slapping and bass slides. Max incorporated a lot of rock bass riffs into bachata.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/aventura-hits-lady-gaga-park-headlining-4-msg-shows-article-1.457611|title=Aventura hits Lady Gaga out of the park, headlining 4 MSG shows - who are they?|last=Farber|first=Jim|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> Their sound helped make the genre mainstream, as showed with the success of their 2002 hit song "Obsesión". The song achieved huge success in many countries, topping many international charts like France, Germany and Italy. Since then they have blown up internationally with hits such as "Su Veneno", "Todavia Me Amas", "El Malo", "Te Invito", "Por Un Segundo", among others. [[Toby Love]] began his music career with Aventura and left in 2005 to pursue a solo career in bachata. They have been inducted into the Bronx Walk of Fame.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://latintrends.com/what-you-didnt-know-about-aventura/|title=What You Didn’t Know about Aventura – LatinTRENDS.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-07}}</ref>

Aventura faced their biggest performance yet when they completely sold out the Madison Square Garden on September 1, 2007. They sold out the arena 360 degrees. They are the first bachata group to have done this. They were accompanied by [[Don Omar]], [[Antony Santos]], [[Wisin & Yandel|Wisin y Yandel]], [[Miri Ben-Ari]], [[Toby Love]], and [[Héctor Acosta (singer)|El Torito]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/kings-of-bachata-sold-out-at-madison-square-garden-mw0000781392|title=Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden - Aventura {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>

In 2009, Aventura was invited to perform their hit single "Su Veneno" at the White House for the [[List of Presidents of the United States|44th President of the United States]], [[Barack Obama]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/inperformanceatthewhitehouse/shows/fiesta-latina/|title=Fiesta Latina {{!}} PBS {{!}} PBS|website=Fiesta Latina {{!}} PBS {{!}} PBS|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> They are the first bachata act to ever perform at the White House.

In February 2010, they sold out the Garden once again, but for a legendary four nights in a row. They surpassed american artists such as Lady Gaga and Madonna in ticket sales, being one of the first Latin groups to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/kings-of-bachata-sold-out-at-madison-square-garden-mw0000781392|title=Kings of Bachata: Sold Out at Madison Square Garden - Aventura {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref> At one of the concerts they paid homage to [[Juan Luis Guerra]], and even sang some songs with the iconic Dominican singer.

==Hiatus==
In 2011, the group announced that they would be taking a hiatus to work on individual musical projects.<ref>{{cite web|author=Mallenbaum, Carly|date=January 8, 2012|title=On the Verge: 'Bachata King' Romeo|url=http://www.usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2012-01-12/on-the-verge-romeo-santos/52400608/1|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121022811/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/story/2012-01-12/on-the-verge-romeo-santos/52400608/1|archive-date=January 21, 2013|access-date=May 16, 2013|work=[[USA Today]]|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc.|df=mdy}}</ref> Henry embarked on a respective solo career, looking to be accepted without the group. Romeo took the opportunity to sign with Sony Music Latin, and embarked on his solo career as well. Although Max wanted to focus more on his rap career, he joined his brother Lenny and formed their new bachata group called "D'Element." under Lenny's record label Element Music Group. They then joined [[Xtreme (group)|Steve Styles]] from the bachata group [[Xtreme (group)|Xtreme]] and renamed the group to [[Grupo Vena|Vena]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://latinmusic.about.com/od/cdtoppicks/tp/Top-Bachata-Songs-2012.htm|title=Top Bachata Songs of 2012|author=Quintana, Carlos|publisher=[[About.com]]|access-date=January 29, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thatsdominican.com/dr/news/vena-delement-project-aventura-xtreme-steve-styles|title=GRUPO VENA: D’element Project (Miembros de Aventura Y Xtreme Se Juntan!)|website=That's Dominican}}</ref>

==Reunions==
The group reunited to close out the second night of Romeo's sold-out [[Yankee Stadium]] concert on July 12, 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Feeney|first1=Michael|title=Romeo Santos joined by Marc Anthony, former Aventura members at sold-out Yankee Stadium show|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/romeo-santos-joined-marc-anthony-aventura-members-article-1.1865408|access-date=July 18, 2014|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=July 13, 2014}}</ref>

On December 1, 2015, it was announced on the band's website and social media that they would have a reunion tour for the whole month of February at the [[United Palace]] theater in New York City. Their first concert since their split started with a sold-out crowd on February 4, 2016 with the final concert ending on February 28, 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latinpost.com/articles/100336/20151207/aventura-2016-reunion-concert-dates-announced.htm|title=Aventura 2016 Reunion Concert Dates Announced|date=2015-12-07|website=Latin Post|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> They would've continued on with the tour, but Romeo had to finish the second leg of his Formula Vol. 2 tour.

On April 1, 2019, the group posted an image on their Instagram account teasing a new Aventura single called "Inmortal" slated to be released at 9PM, captioning it "#UTOPIA".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BvuAYRxhFnd/|title=Romeo Santos on Instagram: "Nuevo sencillo de Aventura esta noche a las 9PM EST. #UT🌍PIA"|via=Instagram|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> At 9PM, Romeo uploaded a video saying that their new song would not be released at 9PM after all, and that it was intended to be an April Fool's joke which led the fans to become upset and lash out on social media. The following day, however, the group apologized and announced that the April Fool's joke was not the song, but was the release date. They then previewed the new single "Inmortal" and its music video, stating that it was being released Friday, as a part of Romeo's fourth upcoming studio album, ''[[Utopia (Romeo Santos album)|Utopia]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/05/arts/music/playlist-aventura-weyes-blood-jpegmafia-hatchie.html|title=The Playlist: Romeo Santos Reunites With Aventura, and 9 More New Songs|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=2019-04-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-10-04|last2=Caramanica|first2=Jon|issn=0362-4331|last3=Russonello|first3=Giovanni}}</ref> It is their first single in 8 years,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8505539/romeo-santos-aventura-single-inmortal-watch|title=Romeo Santos Announces New Aventura Single 'Inmortal' -- No Joke|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-10-04}}</ref> and debuted at number 5 on the Hot Latin Songs chart, and at number 95 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/garysuarez/2019/04/16/aventura-inmortal-utopia/#4cf7deeb230a|title=Reunited For Romeo Santos' Album, Aventura Returns To The Hot 100|access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>''
