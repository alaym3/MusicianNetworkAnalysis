The '''Red Hot Chili Peppers''' are<!-- Proper nouns that are plural in form take a plural verb in both American English and British English. Please do not change "are" to "is". --> an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1983. Their music incorporates elements of [[alternative rock]], [[funk]], [[punk rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]]. The band consists of vocalist [[Anthony Kiedis]], bassist [[Flea (musician)|Flea]], drummer [[Chad Smith]], and guitarist [[John Frusciante]]. With over 100 million records sold worldwide, the Red Hot Chili Peppers are one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling bands of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/entertainment/2011/12/anthony_kiedis_michigan_moment.html|title=Anthony Kiedis' Michigan Moments: Q&A with the Red Hot Chili Peppers lead singer|work=mlive.com|date=December 28, 2011|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/20061006red_hot_chili_peppers_stadium_set_keeps_chili_peppers_red_hot|title='Stadium' Set Keeps Chili Peppers Red Hot|work=[[Broadcast Music, Inc.]]|date=October 5, 2006|access-date=February 19, 2019}}</ref> They are the most successful band in the history of [[alternative rock]], with the records for most number-one singles (13), most cumulative weeks at number one (85) and most top-ten songs (25) on the [[Billboard Alternative Songs chart|''Billboard'' Alternative Songs chart]].<ref name="2020book">{{cite book |last1=Bogosian |first1=Dan |title=Red Hot Chili Peppers FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the World's Best-Selling Alternative Band |date=May 15, 2020 |publisher=Backbeat|isbn=9781493051427|url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/Red_Hot_Chili_Peppers_FAQ/pezSDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=most%20top%20ten%20songs |access-date=September 26, 2021}}</ref> They have won six [[Grammy Award]]s, and in 2012 were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

The Red Hot Chili Peppers were formed in [[Los Angeles]] by Kiedis, Flea, guitarist [[Hillel Slovak]] and drummer [[Jack Irons]]. Due to commitments to other bands, Slovak and Irons did not play on the band's 1984 [[The Red Hot Chili Peppers (album)|self-titled debut album]], which instead featured guitarist [[Jack Sherman]] and drummer [[Cliff Martinez]]. Slovak rejoined for their second album, ''[[Freaky Styley]]'' (1985), and Irons for their third, ''[[The Uplift Mofo Party Plan]]'' (1987). Slovak died of a [[drug overdose]] on June 25, 1988; Irons, devastated, left the band.

With new recruits Frusciante and Smith, the Red Hot Chili Peppers recorded ''[[Mother's Milk]]'' (1989) and their first major commercial success, ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' (1991). Frusciante was uncomfortable with their newfound popularity and left abruptly on tour in 1992. After a series of temporary guitarists, he was replaced by [[Dave Navarro]], who appeared on the group's sixth album, ''[[One Hot Minute]]'' (1995). Although successful, the album failed to match the critical or popular acclaim of ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''. Frusciante and Kiedis struggled with drug addiction throughout the 1990s.

In 1998, following Navarro's departure, Frusciante rejoined the band. Their seventh album, ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), became their biggest commercial success, with 16 million copies sold worldwide. ''[[By the Way]]'' (2002) and ''[[Stadium Arcadium]]'' (2006) were also successful; ''Stadium Arcadium'' was their first album to reach number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. Frusciante left again in 2009 to focus on his solo career; he was replaced by [[Josh Klinghoffer]], who appeared on ''[[I'm with You (album)|I'm with You]]'' (2011) and ''[[The Getaway (Red Hot Chili Peppers album)|The Getaway]]'' (2016), before Frusciante rejoined in 2019.

At the time, Slovak and Irons were already committed to another group, [[What Is This?]]; however, the new band was asked to return the following week.<ref name="KiedisSloman106" /> They changed their name to the Red Hot Chili Peppers, playing several shows at LA venues.

In early 1986, EMI gave the Chili Peppers $5,000 to record a demo tape for their next album. They chose to work with producer [[Keith Levene]] from PIL, as he shared their interest in drugs.<ref name="KiedisSloman187">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=187}}</ref> Levene and Slovak put aside $2,000 of the budget to spend on heroin and [[cocaine]], which created tension between the band members. Martinez's "heart was no longer in the band", but he did not quit, so Kiedis and Flea fired him in April 1986.<ref name="KiedisSloman188">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=188}}</ref> Irons rejoined the band, to their surprise; it marked the first time all four founding members were together since 1983. During the recording and subsequent tour of ''Freaky Styley'', Kiedis and Slovak were dealing with debilitating heroin addictions. Due to his addiction, Kiedis "didn't have the same drive or desire to come up with ideas or lyrics" and appeared at rehearsal "literally asleep".<ref name="KiedisSloman191">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=191}}</ref>

For their third album, the Chili Peppers attempted to hire [[Rick Rubin]] to produce, but he declined due to the band's increasing drug problems.

=== 1990–1993: ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'', fame, and Frusciante's first departure ===
[[File:RickRubinSept09.jpg|thumb|[[Rick Rubin]] has produced six Red Hot Chili Peppers albums.|alt=|upright=0.8]]

In 1990, after the success of ''Mother's Milk'', the Chili Peppers left EMI and entered a major-label bidding war. They signed with [[Warner Bros. records|Warner Bros. Records]] and hired producer [[Rick Rubin]]. Rubin had turned the band down in 1987 because of their drug problems but felt they were now healthier and more focused. He would go on to produce five more of their albums. The writing process was more productive than it had been for ''Mother's Milk'', with Kiedis saying, "[every day], there was new music for me to lyricize".<ref name="KiedisSloman264">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=264}}</ref> At Rubin's suggestion, they recorded in [[The Mansion (recording studio)|the Mansion]], a studio in a house where magician [[Harry Houdini]] once lived.<ref name="pp274">Kiedis, Sloman, 2004. pp. 274–275</ref>

Navarro first appeared with the band at [[Woodstock '94]], performing early versions of new songs.

Kiedis provided multiple vocal styles. His primary approach up to ''[[Blood Sugar Sex Magik]]'' was spoken verse and rapping, which he complemented with traditional vocals. This helped the band to maintain a consistent style.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p93719|pure_url=yes}} |title=Anthony Kiedis Biography |access-date=August 8, 2007 |author=Sutton, Michael |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> As the group matured, notably with ''[[Californication (album)|Californication]]'' (1999), they reduced the number of rapped verses.

Original guitarist Slovak's style was based in blues and funk. Slovak was primarily influenced by hard-rock artists such as Hendrix, [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and Led Zeppelin,<ref name="MullenHillel">Mullen, p. 21</ref> while his playing method was based on improvisation common in funk.<ref name="Consequence">{{cite web |url = http://consequenceofsound.net/2008/07/icons-of-rock-hillel-slovak/ |title = Icons of Rock: Hillel Slovak |last = Sayers |first = Blaine |work = Consequence of Sound |date = July 23, 2008 |access-date = December 22, 2010 |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6FcD3Dkwt?url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2008/07/icons-of-rock-hillel-slovak/ |archive-date = April 4, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> He was noted for an aggressive playing style; he would often play with such force, that his fingers would "come apart".<ref name="Consequence" /> Kiedis observed that his playing evolved during his time away from the group in What Is This?, when Slovak adopted a more fluid style featuring "sultry" elements compared to his earlier hard-rock techniques.<ref>Kiedis, p. 168</ref> On ''The Uplift Mofo Party Plan'' (1987), Slovak experimented with genres outside of traditional funk music including [[reggae]] and [[speed metal]].<ref name=autogenerated1>Kiedis, p. 204</ref> His guitar riffs would often serve as the basis of the group's songs, with the other members writing their parts to complement his guitar work. His melodic riff featured in the song "Behind the Sun" inspired the group to create "pretty" songs with an emphasis on melody.<ref name="KiedisSloman204" /> Kiedis describes the song as "pure Hillel inspiration".<ref>Slovak, p. 12</ref> Slovak also used a [[talk box]] on songs such as "Green Heaven" and "Funky Crime", in which he would sing into a tube while playing to create psychedelic effects.<ref>Kiedis, p. 112</ref>

Frusciante's musical style has evolved over the course of his career. His guitar playing employs melody and emotion rather than virtuosity.{{clarify|date=May 2020|problem=This word is too esoteric.}} Although virtuoso influences can be heard throughout his career, he has said that he often minimizes this.<ref name=Kerrangspain>''Kerrang!''

Klinghoffer's style employed a wide range of unconventional guitar effects and vocal treatments. In his debut Chili Peppers album, ''I'm with You'' (2011), he focused heavily on producing a textured, emotional sound to complement the vocals and atmosphere of each song. He has stated that he is a fan of jazz and funk.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Flea's bass guitar style can be considered an amalgamation of funk, psychedelic, punk, and hard rock.<ref name="fleabio">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p76467|pure_url=yes}} |title=Flea Biography |access-date=August 8, 2007 |author=Prato, Greg |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> The groove-heavy melodies, played through either finger-picking or [[slap bass|slapping]], contributed to their signature style. While Flea's slap bass style was prominent in earlier albums, albums after ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik''<ref name="fleabio" /> have more melodic and funk-driven bass lines. He has also used [[double stop]]s on some newer songs. Flea's bass playing has changed considerably throughout the years. When he joined Fear, his technique centered largely around traditional punk-rock bass lines.<ref name=intbass>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzkeyWNkhpY |title = Interview with Flea in 1988 |access-date = January 16, 2008 |publisher = [[VPRO]] |archive-url = https://www.webcitation.org/6FcD4uLIp?url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JzkeyWNkhpY |archive-date = April 4, 2013 |url-status = live}}</ref> However, he changed this style when the Red Hot Chili Peppers formed.

=== Lyrics and songwriting ===
Early in the group's career, Kiedis wrote comical songs filled with sexual innuendos and songs inspired by friendship and the band members' personal experiences. However, after the death of his close friend and bandmate Hillel Slovak, Kiedis's lyrics became much more introspective and personal, as exemplified by the ''Mother's Milk'' song "Knock Me Down", which was dedicated to Slovak along with the ''Blood Sugar Sex Magik'' song "My Lovely Man".

When the band recorded ''One Hot Minute'' (1995) Kiedis had turned to drugs once again, which resulted in darker lyrics.<ref name="Apter184-190">{{harvnb|Apter|2004|pp=184–190}}</ref> He began to write about anguish, and the self-mutilating thoughts he would experience as a result of his heroin and [[cocaine]] addiction.<ref name=rollingstonearticle>{{cite web |url = https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth |title = The Naked Truth |first = David |last = Fricke |access-date = August 10, 2007 |work = Rolling Stone |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090316023649/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/redhotchilipeppers/articles/story/5938432/the_naked_truth |archive-date = March 16, 2009}}</ref><ref name="KiedisSloman265-266">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|pp=265–266}}</ref> The album also featured tributes to close friends the band lost during the recording process including [[Kurt Cobain]] on the song "Tearjerker" and [[River Phoenix]] on the song "Transcending".

After witnessing Frusciante's recovery from his heroin addiction, Kiedis wrote many songs inspired by rebirth and the meaning of life on ''Californication''. He was also intrigued by the life lessons that the band had learned,<ref name="vh1rhcp">(2002) "[[Behind the Music]]: Red Hot Chili Peppers episode". [[VH1]].</ref> including Kiedis's experience with meeting a young mother at the [[YMCA]], who was attempting to battle her crack addiction while living with her infant daughter.<ref name="KiedisSloman404" />

On ''By the Way'', Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love.<ref name="KiedisSloman456-465">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|pp=456–465}}</ref> Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis's writings, as he had only been sober since 2000.<ref name="KiedisSloman433">{{harvnb|Kiedis|Sloman|2004|p=433}}</ref> Tracks like "This Is the Place" and "Don't Forget Me" expressed his intense dislike for narcotics and the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him. ''Stadium Arcadium'' (2006) continued the themes of love and romance; Kiedis stated, that "love and women, pregnancies and marriages, relationship struggles—those are real and profound influences on this record. And it's great, because it wasn't just me writing about the fact that I'm in love. It was everybody in the band. We were brimming with energy based on falling in love."<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.invisible-movement.net/articles/2006-press/0601-rollingstone |title = Tattooed Love Boys &#124; John Frusciante unofficial website – Invisible Movement |website=Invisible-movement.net |access-date = February 14, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130603060432/http://invisible-movement.net/articles/2006-press/0601-rollingstone |archive-date = June 3, 2013 |df = mdy-all}}</ref> ''I'm with You'' (2011) again featured Kiedis writing about the loss of a close friend, this time in the song "Brendan's Death Song", a tribute to club owner [[Brendan Mullen]] who gave the band some of their earliest shows and showed support to them throughout their career.
