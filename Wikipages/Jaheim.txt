Another Top Ten hit, it placed two singles in the Top 40, "Fabulous" and "Anything" (released November 13, 2001). ''[[Ghetto Classics]]'' followed in early 2006 and became his first number one album. In 2007 Jaheim signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and released his fourth album ''[[The Makings of a Man]]'' in December 2007. In late 2009 the single "[[Ain't Leavin Without You]]" preceded his 2010 album ''[[Another Round (album)|Another Round]]''.
