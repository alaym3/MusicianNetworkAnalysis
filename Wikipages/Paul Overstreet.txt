===Songwriter===
During his songwriting career, primarily in the country genre, Overstreet has written or co-written 27 Top Ten songs. During this time, he has won two Grammy Awards and also won ACM and CMA Song of the Year Awards (1987 and 1988). Overstreet was named the BMI Songwriter of the Year five straight years, from 1987 to 1991, an achievement on music row that has not been achieved before or since. He co-wrote "[[A Long Line of Love]]", "[[Love Can Build a Bridge]]", and "[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]". Other well-known hits of recent years he is known for are "[[She Thinks My Tractor's Sexy]]" by [[Kenny Chesney]] and "[[Some Beach]]" by [[Blake Shelton]], which was a Number One hit in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1497408/paul-overstreet-rory-lee-feek-bask-on-some-beach.jhtml|title=Paul Overstreet, Rory Lee Feek Bask on "Some Beach"|last=Morris|first=Edward|date=February 23, 2005|work=CMT|access-date=January 2, 2014}}</ref>

Paul Overstreet is best known for writing country songs such as "[[Forever and Ever, Amen]]"<ref>{{cite book|first=Paul|last=Overstreet|author2=Jeanne Halsey|year=2001|title=Forever and Ever Amen|location=Shippensburg|publisher=Destiny Image Publishers|isbn=0-7684-2120-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/forevereveramenh0000over}}</ref> and "[[On the Other Hand]]", both of which were Number Ones for [[Randy Travis]]. He also co-wrote "[[When You Say Nothing at All]]" which was a Number One hit at the end of 1988 for [[Keith Whitley]], and later a Top Five hit in 1995 for [[Alison Krauss]], and revived later in 1999 by [[Ronan Keating]] of [[Boyzone]].  He is also known for writing the worship song God Is Good All The Time with [[Don Moen]], which has become one of Moen's signature songs.

In 2019 he partnered with upcoming singer/songwriter Marcus King to write the song Beautiful Stranger.

===Singer===
Overstreet was first signed as a singer in 1982. His debut single, "Beautiful Baby", peaked at No.&nbsp;76 on the country charts that year, and was the first single from his self-titled debut album. After co-writing [[Tanya Tucker]]'s 1987 single "[[I Won't Take Less Than Your Love]]" with [[Don Schlitz]], Overstreet and fellow singer-songwriter [[Paul Davis (singer)|Paul Davis]] became guest vocalists on the song, which became a Number One hit that year.

Also in 1987, Overstreet founded the trio [[S-K-O]] (also known as Schuyler, Knobloch & Overstreet) with [[Thom Schuyler]] and [[J. Fred Knobloch]], both former solo singers. S-K-O charted three singles with Overstreet as a member, including the Number One "[[Baby's Got a New Baby]]". After one album the trio was renamed S-K-B when Overstreet left and was replaced by [[Craig Bickhardt]].

In 1988, Overstreet signed to [[RCA Records Nashville|RCA Nashville]] as a solo artist. His second solo album, ''[[Sowin' Love]]'', accounted for five straight Top 10 hits on the country charts: "[[Love Helps Those]]", [[Sowin' Love (song)|the title track]], "[[All the Fun]]", "[[Seein' My Father in Me]]" and "[[Richest Man on Earth]]." His second album, 1990's ''[[Heroes (Paul Overstreet album)|Heroes]]'', produced his only solo Number One in its lead-off single "[[Daddy's Come Around]]", which was followed by the Top Tens "[[Heroes (Paul Overstreet song)|Heroes]]" and "[[Ball and Chain (Paul Overstreet song)|Ball and Chain]]". However, his chart success soon waned, with "If I Could Bottle This Up" peaking at No.&nbsp;30 and "Billy Can't Read" falling short of Top 40. A third RCA album, ''[[Love Is Strong (album)|Love Is Strong]]'', produced the No.&nbsp;22 "Me and My Baby" and two more singles which missed the Top 40. Also, the song "There But for the Grace of God Go I" won a [[Dove Award]] for Country Recorded Song of the Year at the [[24th GMA Dove Awards]] in 1993. Three years later, Overstreet released his first album for Scarlet Moon Records, ''Time''. It produced his last single to enter the country charts, "We've Got to Keep on Meeting Like This," which peaked at No.&nbsp;73.

In 2013, Overstreet starred in a TV pilot titled ''Nashville Unplugged Live''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3042516/reference|title=Nashville Unplugged (TV Movie 2016) |website=IMDb.com}}</ref> taped in Las Vegas and produced and directed by Michael A. Bloom.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1404954/|title=Michael Bloom|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>  Also starring with Overstreet was songwriter [[Danny Myrick]].
