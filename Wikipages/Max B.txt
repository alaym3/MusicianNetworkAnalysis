== Early life ==

Max B was born Charly Wingate on May 21, 1978<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/BjBy1nmgOwR/</ref> and raised in [[New York City]]. His mother, Sharon Wingate, the eldest of eight siblings, had battled with substance abuse for most of her life and eventually served a year and a half in prison for her crack addiction. Charly was largely raised by his grandparents. According to his mother, his grandmother taught Charly her strong religious values from a young age. As a child, he was friends with future rapper and [[Dipset]] founder [[Cam'ron]]. He grew up with music in the household, and had sung in the Boys Choir of Harlem.<ref name="Complex2013" /> Despite his grandmother's best efforts, Charly was heavily influenced by the streets, and at the age of 18, began serving a sentence for robbery in 1997.<ref name=cool2>{{cite web|last1=Benson|first1=Chris|last2=Porter|first2=D.|url=http://coolehmag.com/frontEnd/feature.php?i=47&s=91|title=Wipeout: The Fall of Max B|work=cool'eh|date=July 2009|issue=14}}</ref> Wingate went on to serve 8 years in prison, before being released in 2005. Following his release, he immediately began pursuing a career in music, choosing the stage name '''Max B'''. The "B" being shorthand for '''Biggaveli''', a [[portmanteau]] referencing [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] ("Biggie Smalls"), [[Jay Z]] ("Jigga") and [[Tupac Shakur]] ("Makaveli").<ref name="Complex2013" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGrl82zhdp8|title=Max B Interview (OnSMASH Exclusive)|publisher=[[OnSMASH]]}}</ref> According to Wingate, his love for rap music came from his deceased brother, Eric, who left him collections of cassettes while he went in and out of town.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

== Music career ==

By 2008, Max B had left ByrdGang amid his allegations he had been forced into a contract which offered him inadequate pay and no recognition of his artistic contributions which included writing hooks, verses and melodies for Jim Jones during their stint. He alleges he was paid $300 for live shows where Jones earned in the range of $10,000–15,000.<ref name="HipHopDX2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.24748/title.max-b-explains-the-roots-of-his-beef-with-jim-jones-the-byrdgang|title=Max B Explains The Roots Of His Beef With Jim Jones & The Byrdgang|work=[[HipHopDX]]|first=Jake|last=Paine|date=July 20, 2013}}</ref><ref name="MTV2008" />

In a 2009 interview before his trial, Max expressed his loss stating, "That was fucked up because the nigga Stacks was close to me, I ain't even gonna front. I was in jail at the time, so a nigga was sitting. A nigga learned to cope with that thing pretty well though, R.I.P. to Stacks. Shout out to my nigga, he played me all the joints he had.

=== Feud with Jim Jones ===
Following his departure from ByrdGang, Max B engaged in a bitter feud with Jim Jones alongside fellow rapper French Montana. According to interviews, French and Max shared a common group of friends and associates.<ref name="VladFrenchMax">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16KCyBqYIpU|title=French Montana On How He Met Max B|publisher=VladTV|date=May 10, 2009|access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref> However, due to French's existing problems with Jim Jones, and Max being signed to his ByrdGang at the time, the two had yet to collaborate.<ref name="VladFrenchMax" /> This would soon change as the two became embroiled in one of the more infamous street beefs in [[East Coast hip hop|New York]] hip hop.

According to Max B, his beef with Jones stems from his allegations he was forced into a contract which offered him inadequate pay and no recognition of his contributions which included writing hooks, verses and melodies for Jim Jones during their stint together. He also alleges he was paid $300 for live shows where Jones earned in the range of $10–15,000.<ref name="HipHopDX2013" /><ref name="MTV2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1582587/young-jeezy-fights-to-get-on-usher-track-dj-felli-fel-wrangles-kanye-west-ne-yo-for-next-single-mixtape-monday/ |title=MTV Mixtape Mondays – 2/29/2008 |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=February 29, 2008 |access-date=February 1, 2016}}</ref> In his infamous interview on ''The Come Up'' Vol. 18 (2008), he confirmed having delivered "10 albums" worth of material to Jones to fulfill the terms of his contract.

In the case of French Montana, his beef with Jim Jones had begun earlier. Albeit also attributed to Jones' disdain towards French for the infamous footage in ''Cocaine City'' Vol. 4 (2006),<ref name="Rucker" /><ref name="RuckerNR" /> depicting Jones and his [[Dipset]] crew being beaten and driven-out during a brawl in [[Rucker Park]], by the [[Brooklyn]]-based [[Junior M.A.F.I.A.|Junior MAFIA]] associated with the late [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Notorious BIG]].<ref name="Rucker">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJSK3DoFrog|title=Jim Jones Jumped By Junior Mafia|website=Youtube.com|publisher=Cocaine City|date=February 7, 2006|access-date=August 25, 2015}}<br />{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3RzJXF-T9A|title=Jim Jones & Cam'ron Get Jumped at Rucker Park (Cocaine City DVD Vol. 4)|website=Youtube.com|publisher=Cocaine City|date=July 7, 2010|access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name="RuckerNR">{{cite web|url=http://nahright.com/news/2006/01/31/dipset-vs-junior-mafia-the-rucker/|title=Dipset vs. Junior Mafia @ The Rucker|publisher=NahRight.com|date=January 31, 2006|access-date=August 25, 2015}}</ref> According to French, his personal problems with Jones stems from his claims that Jones was publicly insinuating having a hand with the people responsible for a shooting targeting French.<ref name="VladTvBeef" /> In a 2009 interview with VladTV, French claimed that Jones – by then well known for his numerous feuds and provocations – was using the late-2003 incident to increase his reputation in the streets.<ref name="VladTvBeef">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akO288f6w_s|title=French Montana Speaks On BEEF With Jim Jones|publisher=VladTV|date=May 11, 2009|access-date=August 11, 2015}}</ref>

By the time Max B left ByrdGang in 2008, Jim Jones had garnered a streak of feuds with rappers, ranging from [[Junior MAFIA]] to would-be [[Jay-Z]] affiliate Tru Life. [[Tru Life]] had already appeared in various interviews, including one on ''Cocaine City'' Vol. 8 (2007)<ref name="TruLife">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhszPO381i6sKtFOaG|title=Cocaine City 8: Tru-Life Interview Part 1|website=WorldStarHipHop.com|publisher=Cocaine City|date=June 11, 2007|access-date=August 15, 2015}}<br />{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh4p70gYD5r6ca4f36|title=Cocaine City 8: Tru-Life Interview Part 2|website=WorldStarHipHop.com|publisher=Cocaine City|date=June 11, 2007|access-date=August 15, 2015}}</ref> showing off two Dipset chains he claimed to have snatched off of Jones.<ref name="TruLife" /> Max B's affiliation with French and their mutual beef with Jim Jones was a very public one – resulting in numerous back-and-forth "diss" videos, interviews, confrontations and accusations – which appeared on street DVDs such as Cocaine City, Smack, Come Up, Sub-0, as well as websites such as ''HipHopBeef.com'' and ''WorldStarHipHop.com'' which were just beginning to gain a foothold.

In June 2008, Max B had signed a three-album deal with independent record label [[Amalgam Digital]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sohhdotcom.blogspot.com/2008/07/max-b-signs-w-amalgam-digital-says-jim.html|title=NEWS: Max B Signs W/ Amalgam Digital, Says Jim Jones' Wife "Touched It In Miami"|work=SOHH.com|first=Cyrus|last=Langhorne|date=July 2, 2008}}</ref><ref name="YoRapper">{{cite web|url=http://www.yorapper.com/max-b-signs-deal-with-amalgam-digital/|title=Max B Signs Deal with Amalgam Digital|publisher=YoRapper.com|date=July 1, 2008|access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref> Soon after, however, they would be prevented by Jim Jones' legal team from making any commercial releases of Max's music. This would continue until May 2010, a year after Max B was sentenced, where in a lawsuit victory a New York City judge ruled that Jones no longer had rights over the now-incarcerated rapper's music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/xxl-magazine/2010/05/max-b-freed-from-obligations-to-jim-jones/|title=Max B Freed From Obligations to Jim Jones, ''Vigilante Season'' on the Way|publisher=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]|date=May 27, 2010|access-date=February 1, 2016}}</ref> Thereby allowing Amalgam to release his debut album ''[[Vigilante Season]]''. The project which was recorded in 2008, and originally intended to be released sometime after ''Public Domain 3'',<ref name="YoRapper" /> was finally released on March 22, 2011. Notable songs from ''Vigilante Season'' include "Money Make Me Feel Better", "Where Do I Go" and "Lord Is Tryna Tell Ya Something" among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15339-vigilante-season/|title=Max B: Vigilante Season|work=Pitchfork Media|first=David|last=Drake|date=April 25, 2011|access-date=May 28, 2015}}</ref>

=== 2009-present: Last year before jail and further success ===

The first half of 2009 would be Max B's last as a free man. Following the release of his eleventh mixtape ''Coke Wave'' on February 5, he released his twelfth mixtape ''Quarantine'' on February 21 later that month. The fifth installation in his flagship "Public Domain" series, notable tracks off ''Quarantine'' include "I Ain't Tryna", "All My Life", "Don't Love Hoes", and "DJ Saved My Life" featuring Mak Mustard.<ref name="Quarantine">{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/10106/max_b_quarantine.html |title=''Max B – Quarantine'' |website=livemixtapes.com |date=February 21, 2009}}</ref>

On June 4, Max B was sentenced to 75 years in prison, found guilty on 9 of 11 counts in the case involving himself, Gina Conway and Kevin Leerdam.<ref name="MTV2009" /> Based on the testimony of Conway, he is accused of conspiring the event, and will be eligible for parole in 2042. Conway was sentenced to 18 years, and Leerdam was sentenced to life in prison.

Following his verdict, his fourteenth mixtape ''Million Dollar Baby 3'' was released on June 30. His fifteenth mixtape and sixth installment in his "Public Domain" series, ''PD6: Walking The Plank'', was released on July 12.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/10458/max_b_pd6.html |title=''Max B – PD6: Walking The Plank'' |website=livemixtapes.com |date=July 12, 2009}}</ref> Notable tracks off the record include "Dead Solver", "Never Wanna Go Back", "Letter To Stack Bundles", and "What You Want From Me" featuring [[Beanie Sigel]] and French Montana. His collaborative mixtape ''Coke Wave 2'' with French was released on November 3, 2009.<ref name="CokeWave2">{{cite web|url=http://www.livemixtapes.com/mixtapes/10866/french_montana_max_b_coke_wave_2.html |title=''French Montana & Max B – Coke Wave 2'' |date=November 3, 2009 }}</ref>

Albeit in prison since June 2009, Max B has been featured on various artists' records, utilizing preexisting recordings or through phoned-in verses and messages from prison. A collaborative mixtape titled ''Dopeman'' with fellow Gain Greene rapper Mak Mustard was released on April 4, 2010. A collaborative mixtape ''A Wave Called Yes'' with Amalgam labelmate Young Riot was released on May 26. The record contained two collaborative tracks featuring [[Curren$y]] who had signed to Amalgam in 2009, having had the opportunity to work with Max during his final months before his sentencing. In 2012, [[Isaiah Toothtaker]] released a collaborative mixtape called ''Toothy Wavy'' which featured phoned-in verses from Max B,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2012/05/isaiah_toothtaker_max_b.php|title=Isaiah Toothtaker and Max B Show Off Toothy Wavy Videos|work=Phoenix New Times|first=Jason P.|last=Woodbury|date=May 7, 2012|access-date=May 28, 2015}}</ref> and production by [[The Hood Internet]].<ref name=prefix>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/toothy-wavy-mixtape-prefix-premiere/65232/|title=Max B & Isaiah Toothtaker 'Toothy Wavy' (Mishka Mixtape) Prod.

In 2016, a phone conversation with [[French Montana]] was featured on the track "[[Siiiiiiiiilver Surffffeeeeer Intermission]]" from Kanye West's 7th studio album, ''[[The Life of Pablo]]''. He dropped a song with French Montana called "Hold On" in 2019.

== Controversies ==

=== Allegations of blackballing ===
Together with his producers [[Dame Grease]] and Young Los,<ref name="YoungLos">{{cite web|date=November 3, 2013|title=On The Grind: Q&A With Young Los|url=http://www.ahumblesoul.com/blog/sound-of-the-wave-q-a-with-young-los|access-date=February 15, 2016|publisher=AHumbleSoul.com}}</ref> newfound partner French Montana, and mixtape DJ's Big Mike and Lazy K, Max B had garnered a sizeable underground movement that pushed his music online and throughout the [[Northeastern United States|North Eastern]] region. Particularly noteworthy since, throughout their stint Max B and French would allege being "blackballed" by radio and media.<ref name="MaxAHH">{{cite web|date=November 8, 2012|title=Exclusive: Max B Co-Signs French Montana and Ponders Diddy's NYC Domination|url=http://allhiphop.com/2012/11/08/max-b-co-signs-french-montana-and-ponders-diddys-nyc-domination/|access-date=August 14, 2015|publisher=AllHipHop.com}}</ref><ref name="Power105may2013">{{cite web|date=May 22, 2013|title=French Montana Interview With The Breakfast Club!

As a response to being blackballed, the two would rely on [[grassroots]] and online methods of promotion. French Montana – who had a background in Cocaine City – and Max B, would utilize outlets such as street DVDs and hip hop websites to promote themselves and their respective projects. Since the early-2000s, street DVDs had emerged as a lucrative underground medium providing a "behind the scenes" look into the business and politics of major and upcoming rappers. By the late 2000s, websites such as [[WorldStarHipHop|WSHH]] and others would take on the same spot; consequently, marking the decline of street DVDs as an outdated and non-lucrative format.

Another tactic was to release a flood of music/mixtapes. In 2008 alone, Max B had released over half a dozen mixtapes. The ''Coke Wave'' mixtape, and its sequel ''Coke Wave 2'', were accompanied by DVD films which included music videos, in-studio footage, skits, and videos revolving around their beef with background commentary.<ref name="CokeWaveDVD" /> ''Coke Wave 2'', in addition to the ''Take A Look Into My Life'' DVD, which were released subsequent to Max B's sentencing, further included footage related to his trial and commentary on his legal situation. French would touch on the subject of having been blackballed in a number of interviews following his mainstream breakout.<ref name="Power105may2013" /><ref name="2012WhooKid" /><ref name="RapFixLive">{{cite web|date=March 8, 2012|title=French Montana Wasn't Gonna Do XXL Freshman Cover|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1680742/french-montana-xxl-freshman-cover.jhtml|access-date=January 7, 2013|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> In a 2012 interview from prison, Max B touched on the subject noting,
<blockquote>
I was completely blackballed, my songs on the radio. I couldn't help myself but I was always able to help French do what he wanted to do [...] if I had to blow trial, at least I know a n**ga out there holding it down [...] I'm talking to French; we communicate a couple times a week [...] he real wavy right now.<ref name="MaxAHH" /></blockquote>

=== Felony murder charges ===
According to authorities, Max sent his ex-girlfriend, Gina Conway, and his stepbrother Kelvin Leerdam, in 2006 to rob two men in a Holiday Inn, in [[Fort Lee, New Jersey|Fort Lee]], [[Northern New Jersey]]. On September 22, 2006, Conway and Leerdam ambushed Allan "Jay" Plowden in room 408 and restrained him with duct tape, while awaiting Plowden's partner, David Taylor. Also in the room was Gissele Nieven. When Taylor arrived, he was immediately shot, point-blank, execution-style, in the head. He did not have any money on him.

The crew fled the scene, Plowden then alerted the hotel front desk of the murder. As police entered the room, Plowden was caught moving $30,000 out of the room. Plowden was later charged with money laundering and identity theft. One week later Conway, Leerdam and coordinator Max B were apprehended and charged.

On January 9, 2007, Max B was remanded to Bergen County Jail in New Jersey on a $2 million bail.<ref>Phillips, Rashad.

On March 19, 2010, Max B was granted an appeal with a new trial and lawyer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/crime_courts/Rapper_sentenced_to_75_years_in_Fort_Lee_hotel_robbery.html|title=Rapper gets 75 years for fatal Fort Lee hotel robbery|last=Markos|first=Kibret|date=September 3, 2009|work=The Record|access-date=September 4, 2009}}</ref>

In February 2012, rumors spread that Max's request for an appeal had been denied, but it since has been cleared up as an internet/blog/Twitter rumor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://itsbizkit.com/2012/02/max-b-says-dont-believe-internet-rumors/|title=Max B Says "Dont Believe Internet Rumors"|publisher=Itsbizkit}}</ref>

On August 30, 2012, Max's appeal was denied and he was set to remain in prison to finish his 75-year incarceration.

On September 16, 2016, French Montana released a statement revealing Max B has taken a plea bargain for aggravated manslaughter and is set to be released within 2 to 6 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theboombox.com/2012/08/31/max-b-appeal-denied/|title=Max B Appeal Denied: N.J.
