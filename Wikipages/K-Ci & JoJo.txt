'''K-Ci & JoJo''' is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] duo, consisting of brothers '''[[K-Ci (singer)|Cedric "K-Ci" Hailey]]''' (born September 2, 1969<ref name="dob">{{cite book | last = Whitburn | first = Joel |author-link= Joel Whitburn | title = The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits |edition=8th | publisher = Billboard Books | location = New York | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8230-7499-4 | page = 339 }}</ref>) and '''Joel "JoJo" Hailey''' (born June 10, 1971<ref name="dob"/>). Natives of [[Monroe, North Carolina]], they are also the lead singers of the [[Record chart#Chart hit|chart-topping]] R&B group [[Jodeci]] with the DeGrate brothers—Donald (better known as [[DeVante Swing]]) and [[Dalvin DeGrate|Mr. Dalvin]].

==Music career==
===Music beginnings===
K-Ci and JoJo first landed on the scene as members of a family gospel quartet, Little Cedric and the Hailey Singers of North Carolina. The group released 3 albums on the AIR (Atlanta International Records) label: "I'm Alright Now" in 1983, "Jesus Saves" which hit number 4 on the Billboard Gospel chart in 1984 and "God's Blessings" which hit number 22 in 1985. They joined brothers Donald "DeVanté Swing" DeGrate and Dalvin "Mr. Dalvin" DeGrate to form the R&B group Jodeci. K-Ci & JoJo's first sign of independence came in 1994 when [[Little Cedric|K-Ci]] [[cover version|covered]] [[Bobby Womack]]'s hit "If You Think You're Lonely Now" for the movie ''[[Jason's Lyric]]''. Early in 1996, K-Ci & JoJo teamed up for the song "How Could You" for the movie ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' starring [[Damon Wayans]] and [[Adam Sandler]].<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music|title-link=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=212}}</ref> By July 1996, K-Ci & JoJo were featured guest artists in [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]]'s number-one R&B and [[Billboard Hot 100]] hit "[[How Do U Want It]]".<ref name="Larkin90"/>

===1997-98: ''Love Always''===
The brothers made their side projects into a full album, ''[[Love Always]]''.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Released on June 17, 1997, the album spawned two top-ten R&B hits: "You Bring Me Up" (Pop #26) and "Last Night's Letter" (Pop #46). The minor success of those singles, however, paled in comparison to the success of the album's third single, "[[All My Life (K-Ci & JoJo song)|All My Life]]" (which was dedicated to JoJo's daughter).<ref name="Larkin90"/> A supple, lush [[ballad]] far removed from the Jodeci material of the early 1990s, "All My Life" was the number-one song on the Hot 100 for three weeks, a feat that K-Ci & JoJo had never achieved with Jodeci.<ref name="Larkin90"/> While future singles and albums would be crafted in the vein of "All My Life", it remains the duo's only number-one hit and by far the song they are most widely known for, even amongst non-fans due to its frequent use in film and television. ''Love Always'' went on to sell four million copies, and the success of the album put Jodeci's reunion on hold indefinitely. During the recording of ''Love Always'' they also appeared in the song "I Care 'Bout You" as a member of the R&B supergroup Milestone along with [[After 7]] which appeared on the soundtrack for the movie, ''[[Soul Food (film)|Soul Food]]'' that was written and produced by [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]].

In 1998, K-Ci & JoJo recorded the song "Money Can't Buy You Love," which was produced for the film [[The Players Club]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119905/soundtrack|title=The Players Club (1998)|website=IMDb.com|access-date=December 10, 2019}}</ref>
 
In 1999, K-Ci & JoJo recorded "Life", which was written and produced by [[R. Kelly]], for the soundtrack to the [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Martin Lawrence]] movie ''[[Life (1999 film)|Life]]''.

===1999: ''It's Real''===
K-Ci & JoJo's second studio album, ''[[It's Real (K-Ci & JoJo album)|It's Real]]'' was released on June 22, 1999.<ref name="Larkin90"/> It peaked at number&nbsp;eight on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="its-real-allmusic-chart">{{cite web | url=http://allmusic.com/album/its-real-r421420/charts-awards | title=It's Real – K-Ci & JoJo > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=July 26, 2011}}</ref> peaked at number&nbsp;two on the R&B/Hip Hop Albums,<ref name="its-real-allmusic-chart" /> and was certified platinum by the RIAA. Outside of the US, the album reached top&nbsp;20 on the [[Dutch Albums Chart#Mega Album Top 100|Dutch Mega Album Top 100]], the [[Canadian Albums Chart]], and appeared on the [[RIANZ#Sales charts|New Zealand Top 40 Albums]] and the ARIA Charts. The album spawned four singles, including the number-two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' song]], "Tell Me It's Real".<ref name="Larkin90"/>

''It's Real'' received a three star rating from [[AllMusic]].<ref name="allmusic-review">{{cite web | url=http://allmusic.com/album/its-real-r421420/review | title=It's Real – K-Ci & JoJo > Review  | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=July 26, 2011 | author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas}}</ref>

===2000: ''X''===
K-Ci & JoJo returned with ''X'' on December 5, 2000. ''[[X (K-Ci & JoJo album)|X]]'', the Roman numeral for ten, was picked as the album title to celebrate the Haileys' tenth anniversary in the music business. They made a strong return to the Billboard Hot 100 early in 2001 with the song [[Crazy (K-Ci and JoJo song)|"Crazy"]], also included on the ''[[Save the Last Dance]]'' soundtrack. "Crazy" peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100. The album also features a hidden [[Jodeci]] track entitled "Slip And Fall". Other tracks included "Honest Lover," "One Last Time," and "All the Things I Should Have Known"  which Vibe magazine considered "convey a similar mix of hip hop collective that launched Del the Funky Homosapien."<ref>Vibe -Jan 2001 - Page 140 "The first single, "Crazy," is a tender plea for a lover's forgiveness, while "Honest Lover," "One Last Time," and "All the Things I Should Have Known" convey a similar mix of hip hop collective that launched Del the Funky Homosapien.</ref>

===2002-08: ''Emotional'' & Other projects===
The fourth K-Ci & JoJo album, ''Emotional'', was released on November 26, 2002, but did not find commercial success. The CD consisted of two singles, "This Very Moment." and the Rodney "Dark Child" Jerkins produced "It's Me".  The album contained their personal favorite "How Long" written by Steve Vaughn and Jojo Hailey.

In late 2006, K-Ci released his debut solo album entitled ''My Book''. K-Ci & JoJo released a [[greatest hits]] album on February 8, 2005. On February 6, 2008, they released their fifth compilation album called ''[[Love (K-Ci & JoJo album)|Love]]'', which was released only in Japan.

On June 25, 2013, they released their new single, "Knock It Off" via [[iTunes]] through [[E1 Music]]. On September 30, 2013, ''[[My Brother's Keeper (K-Ci and JoJo album)|My Brother's Keeper]]'', was released.
