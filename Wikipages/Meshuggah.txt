'''Meshuggah''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ʊ|ɡ|ə}})<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meshuggah|title=Meshuggah|work=[[Merriam-Webster]]|access-date=9 August 2010}}</ref> is a Swedish [[extreme metal]] band formed in [[Umeå]] in 1987. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist Jens Kidman, lead guitarist [[Fredrik Thordendal]], drummer [[Tomas Haake]], rhythm guitarist [[Mårten Hagström]] and bassist [[Dick Lövgren]]. Since its formation, the band has released eight studio albums, six [[extended play|EPs]] and eight music videos. Their latest studio album, ''[[The Violent Sleep of Reason]]'', was released on 7 October 2016.

Meshuggah has become known for their innovative musical style and their complex, [[Meter (music)#Polymeter|polymetered]] song structures and [[polyrhythm]]s. They rose to fame as a significant act in extreme [[underground music]], became an influence for modern metal bands, and gained a [[cult following]]. The band was labelled as one of the ten most important [[hard rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and as the most important band in metal by ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]''. In the late 2000s, the band was an inspiration for the [[djent]] subgenre.

In 2006 and 2009, Meshuggah was nominated for two Swedish [[Grammis|Grammis Awards]] for their albums ''[[Catch Thirtythree]]'' and ''[[obZen]]'', respectively. In 2018, the band was nominated for a [[60th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] for their song "Clockworks" under the "Best Metal Performance" category.<ref name="grammy2018">{{cite web|last1=Lynch|first1=Joe|title=Grammys 2018: See the Complete List of Nominees|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/grammys/8047027/grammys-2018-complete-nominees-list|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref> The band has performed in various international festivals, including [[Ozzfest]] and [[Download Festival|Download]], and embarked on the [[ObZen Tour|''obZen'' world tour]] from 2008 to 2010, and also the "Ophidian Trek".

During this period, Thordendal, who was working as a carpenter, severed the tip of his left middle finger, while Haake injured his hand in a router accident.<ref name="AMG bio" /><ref name="Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/> As a result, the band was unable to perform for several months. Thordendal's fingertip was later reattached, and he went on to make a full recovery.<ref name="Official bio" /> The ''[[Selfcaged]]'' EP was recorded in April and May 1994, but its release was delayed to later in 1995 due to the accidents.<ref name="AMG bio" /><ref name="Official bio" />

=== ''Destroy Erase Improve'' (1995–1997) ===
[[File:Fredrik Thordendal Meshuggah Live at Getaway Rock Festival 2012.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Lead guitarist [[Fredrik Thordendal]] performing in 2012]]

In January 1995, Meshuggah undertook a short European tour organized by its record label Nuclear Blast. Afterwards, the band returned to the studio in February of that year to record the album ''[[Destroy Erase Improve]]''<ref name="Official bio" /> at Soundfront Studios in [[Uppsala]], with Daniel Bergstrand as a producer.<ref name="Rockdetector Bio" /> Shortly thereafter, the band went on a European tour supporting [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]] for two months.<ref name="Official bio" /> During the tour, Nordin became ill and experienced difficulties with his inner ear balance. Due to the resulting chronic dizziness and vertigo, Nordin was forced to leave the tour and travel to Sweden. Machine Head's bassist [[Adam Duce]] offered to cover his absence; however, Meshuggah decided to continue as a four-piece. Sometimes Thordendal played bass, while other times the band performed with two guitars. In this lineup, Hagström would use a [[Pitch shifter (audio processor)|pitch shifter]] to play his guitar at an [[octave]] lower than usual.<ref name="Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/>

''Destroy Erase Improve'' was released in May 1995, with positive response from critics for the "heady tempos and abstract approach".<ref name="AMG bio" /><ref name="AMG DEI">{{cite web|url = {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r228054|pure_url=yes}}|website = [[AllMusic]]|title = Destroy Erase Improve review|author = John Serba|access-date = 10 June 2008}}</ref> Kidman described the album cover: "The title fits the pictures we cut out and stole from reference books in the library."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=59436 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |title=Meshuggah's 'Destroy Erase Improve' Inducted Into Decibel's 'Hall Of Fame' - Sep. 29, 2006 |access-date=8 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226000827/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=59436 |archive-date=26 December 2008 }}</ref>

In mid-1995, Meshuggah had a short tour with Swedish band [[Clawfinger]] in Scandinavia and Germany. Nordin had to leave the band because of his sickness and was replaced by bassist Gustaf Hielm during the tour.<ref name="Rockdetector Bio" /><ref name="Blabbermouth Meshuggah Guitarist: 'We're Always Experimental In One Way Or Another'">{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=101386 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |title=Meshuggah Guitarist: 'We're Always Experimental In One Way Or Another' - July 22, 2008 |access-date=25 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226000420/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=101386 |archive-date=26 December 2008 }}</ref> In late 1995, Meshuggah went on a month-long tour with [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]].<ref name="Rockdetector Bio" />

During 1996 and 1997, Thordendal worked on his solo album ''[[Sol Niger Within]]'', which was released in March 1997 in Scandinavia and in April in Japan. He also hosted [[Mats/Morgan Band]]'s debut. In 1997, Meshuggah recorded an unreleased demo, toured occasionally, and played a few concerts in its hometown. In May, Meshuggah moved to Stockholm to be closer to its management and the record industry in general.<ref name="Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/>

The EP ''[[The True Human Design]]'' was recorded and released in late 1997. It contained one new song entitled "Sane", and one live and two alternate versions of ''Destroy Erase Improve''{{'}}s opening track "Future Breed Machine".<ref name="Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/><ref>{{cite web|title = The True Human Design - 1997|url = http://www.meshuggah.net/disco/tthd/|publisher = meshuggah.net|access-date = 11 May 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080725211031/http://www.meshuggah.net/disco/tthd/ |archive-date = 25 July 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Thordendal's solo album ''Sol Niger Within'' was simultaneously released in the United States, and Meshuggah started to plan its next album at the end of the year.<ref name="Official bio" />

=== ''Chaosphere'' and ''Nothing'' (1998–2002) ===
[[File:Meshuggah - Mårten Hagström 2 - 2008 Melbourne.jpg|thumb|upright|Rhythm guitarist [[Mårten Hagström]] with a custom built [[Ibanez]] eight-string guitar]]

Hielm officially joined the band in January&nbsp;1998 after more than two years as a session member. Nuclear Blast re-released ''Contradictions Collapse'' with the addition of songs from the ''None'' EP. In May&nbsp;1998, the title of the next album, ''[[Chaosphere]]'', was reported and recording was done throughout May and June. Immediately after recording the album, Meshuggah went on a short US tour, and the album was released later in November 1998. Chaosphere's sound is an almost complete departure from the thrash metal style of the band's previous releases. Shortly after the release, Meshuggah toured Scandinavia with [[Entombed (band)|Entombed]].<ref name="Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/>

In early 1999, Meshuggah joined [[Slayer]] on their U.S. tour.<ref name="Decibel story" /><ref name="Rockdetector Bio" /> After the new album and the live performances, Meshuggah was beginning to be recognized by mainstream music, guitar, drum and metal magazines.<ref name="Allmusic Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/> In mid-1999, Meshuggah performed in several Swedish concerts. The band started to write some new material but reported in mid-2000 that "songwriting isn't that dramatic, but we're getting there slowly".<ref name="Official bio" /> While fans were waiting for the next album, a collection of demos (from the ''Psykisk Testbild'' EP), remixes and unreleased songs from the ''Chaosphere'' sessions were released as the ''[[Rare Trax]]'' album.<ref name="AMG bio" /><ref name="Official bio" /><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=4&fid1=543&csid1=23 |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |title=Meshuggah Are Breaking the Silence |author=Greg Pratt |access-date=5 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220114801/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid2=4&fid1=543&csid1=23 |archive-date=20 December 2008 }}</ref> Hielm left the band in July 2001 for unclear reasons.<ref name="Official Bio + Rockdetector Bio"/> Meshuggah joined [[Tool (band)|Tool]] on a lengthy tour, playing for more than 100,000 people total.<ref name="Decibel story" /><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/Blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=219 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |title=Archive News - Oct. 5, 2001 |access-date=1 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050327085250/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=219 |archive-date=27 March 2005 }}</ref>

In March 2002, Meshuggah recorded three-track demos with programmed drums in their home studio, which were based on Haake's sample ''Drumkit from Hell''.

=== ''I'' and ''Catch Thirtythree'' (2003–2006) ===
In 2003, Hagström hinted at the direction of the band's next album by saying, "There's only one thing I really feel that is important. We've never measured our success in terms of sales, because we're quite an extreme band. It's more that people understand where we're coming from. I get more out of a fan coming up and saying that we've totally changed their way of looking on metal music, than having like 200 kids buy it. I mean, it would be nice for the money, but that's not why we're in it. So what I'd like to see is that we keep progressing. Keeping the core of what Meshuggah has always been, but exploring the bar, so to speak. ''Destroy Erase Improve'' was like exploring the dynamics of the band, ''Chaosphere'' was exploring the aggressiveness, the all-out side, and ''Nothing'' is more of a sinister, dark, pretty slow album, actually. So honestly, now I don't know where we're going. It might be a mix of all of them."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=13041 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |title=Meshuggah: Off Nuclear Blast, Weighing Their Options - June 24, 2003 |access-date=8 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226000727/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=13041 |archive-date=26 December 2008 }}</ref>

Meshuggah's experimentation, stylistic variation and changes during its career cross several musical subgenres.

Trademarks and characteristics that define Meshuggah's sound and songwriting include [[polyrhythm]]s, [[polymeter]]ed riff cycles, rhythmic [[syncopation]], rapid [[Key (music)|key]] and [[tempo]] changes and neo-[[jazz]] [[Diatonic and chromatic|chromatics]].{{ref label|d|d|none}} Hagström notes that "it doesn't really matter if something is hard to play or not. The thing is, what does it do to your mind when you listen to it? Where does it take you?"<ref name="Decibel story" /> A trademark of Thordendal is [[jazz fusion]]-like soloing and improvisation. He is also known for the usage of a "breath controller" device. Haake is known for his [[cross-rhythm]] drumming with "jazzlike cadence".{{ref label|e|e|none}} The vocal style of Jens Kidman varies between [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-style shouts<ref name="AMG DEI" /> and "robotic" [[Death growl|death metal vocals]].<ref name="AMG Nothing" /><ref name="Blender obZen" />

In polymeters typically used by Meshuggah, the guitars might play in odd meters such as 5/16 or 17/16, while drums play in 4/4.<ref name="Stylus Nothing" /> One particular example of Haake's use of polymeter is 4/4 against 23/16 bimeter, in which he keeps the [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hat]] and [[ride cymbal]] in 4/4 time but uses the [[Snare drum|snare]] and [[Bass drum#Double bass drum|double bass drums]] in 23/16 time.<ref name="Rockdetector Bio" /><ref name="PopMatters I" /> On "Rational Gaze" (from ''Nothing''), Haake plays simple 4/4 time, hitting the snare on each third beat, for 16 bars. At the same time, the guitars and bass are playing same quarter notes, albeit in a different time signature; eventually both sides meet up again at the 64th beat.<ref name="Popmatters Nothing" /> Hagström notes about the polymeters, "We've never really been into the odd time signatures we get accused of using. Everything we do is based around a 4/4 core. It's just that we arrange parts differently around that center to make it seem like something else is going on."<ref name="Decibel story" />

For ''obZen'', Haake returned to the drum kit most notably with his performance on the song "Bleed".<ref name="AMG obZen" /><ref name="RS obZen" /> In an interview for Gravemusic.com, Haake stated, "['Bleed'] was a big effort for me to learn, I had to find a totally new approach to playing the double bass drums to be able to do that stuff. I had never really done anything like that before like the fast bursts that go all the way through the song basically. So I actually spent as much time practicing that track alone as I did with all of the other tracks combined. It's kind of a big feat to change your approach like that and I'm glad we were able to nail it for the album.

However, careful examination reveals that the material is some of the group's most complicated".<ref name="Revolver Meshuggah"/>

A common quality in ''Koloss'' identified by multiple critics and outlets is the album's relatively straightforward, more groove-oriented sound, summed up by ''[[Metal Sucks]]'' as the band having "streamlined their compositions to a great extent."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2012/03/15/review-meshuggahs-koloss-is-a-giant/ |title=Review: Meshuggah's ''Koloss'' is a Giant |last=Rosenberg |first=Axl |date=15 March 2012 |website=Metal Sucks |publisher=Metal Sucks |access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref> The broad style of the record has been described as "primal" and featuring "less jazzy virtuosity" than the band's previous output.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://music.avclub.com/meshuggah-koloss-1798172123 |title=Meshuggah: ''Koloss'' |last=Heller |first=Jason |date=27 March 2012 |website=The AV Club |publisher=The AV Club |access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' noted that the record's rawer production style advanced this "tribal" sound further.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22142-25-years-of-musical-deviance/ |title=Meshuggah: 25 years of Musical Deviance |last=Reyes-Kulkarni |first=Saby |date=1 August 2016 |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork |access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref> The album invokes a greater sound of menace and "darkness" according to Metal Injection; additionally, Jens Kidman's vocals were described as "exponentially more anguished" than previous works.<ref name=metinject>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalinjection.net/reviews/meshuggah-koloss |title=Album Review: MESHUGGAH ''Koloss'' |last=Brown |first=Kit |date=20 March 2012 |website=Metal Injection |publisher=Metal Injection |access-date=6 November 2018}}</ref> ''Metal Injection'' further compared the sound of the ''Koloss'''s closing track "The Last Vigil" to works by the instrumental band [[Godspeed You!

== Songwriting, recording, and lyrics ==
Meshuggah's music is written by Thordendal, Hagström and Haake with assistance from Kidman and Lövgren. During songwriting, a member programs the drums, and records the guitar and bass via computer. He presents his idea to the other members as a finished work. Meshuggah typically adheres to the original idea and rarely changes the song afterwards.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=106332 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |title=Meshuggah Guitarist On Songwriting, Touring And Influencing Younger Bands - Oct. 6, 2008 |access-date=10 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007234319/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=106332 |archive-date=7 October 2008 }}</ref> Hagström explains that each member has an idea of what the others are doing conceptually, and nobody thinks exclusively in terms of a particular instrument. Kidman does not play guitar in the band anymore, but he is involved in writing riffs.<ref name="Decibel story" />

Except for when Hagström needs a soloist, he and Thordendal rarely record together. Both play guitar and bass while composing. Haake says about his songwriting, "Sometimes I'll sample guitar parts, cut them up, pitch-shift and tweak them until I've built the riffs I want, just for demoing purposes. But most of the time I'll just present the drums, and explain my ideas for the rest of the song, sing some riffs."<ref name="Decibel story2" /> The band uses [[Cubase]] to record the tracks, and the guitars are routed through software [[amplifier modeling]], because it allows them to change the amp settings even after the song was fully recorded.<ref>''Konstrukting The Koloss''</ref>

Approximately once a year, Haake writes most of the band's lyrics, with the exception of finished tracks. His lyrical inspirations are derived from books and films. Aside from their album ''Catch Thirtythree'', Meshuggah does not usually record [[concept album]]s, although the band prefers strong conceptual underpinnings in the background.<ref name="Decibel story" /><ref name="The Aquarian: Challenges Collapse">{{cite news

The main theme of ''obZen'' is "human evil", according to Haake. The title is a play on the words "[[obscenity|obscene]]" and "[[Zen]]"; in addition, "ob" means "anti" in Latin. Therefore, the title suggests that the human species has found harmony and balance in warfare and bloodshed.<ref name="Decibel story2" /><ref name="Exclaim! obZen Greg Pratt">{{cite magazine

}}</ref> ''Revolver Magazine'' finds the lyrics of the title track from ''obZen'' representative of the entire album: "Salvation found in vomit and blood/Where depravation, lies, corruption/War and pain is god." However, Haake claims, "We don't dwell on hate and bad feelings as people. But with these songs, I think we really wanted to paint a picture lyrically that might be seen as a cautionary tale. We're going, 'Heads up. Here's what some of the parts of being human are about, and this is what we can be at our worst.' So it's more about being aware of negative feelings than actually living them all the time."<ref name="Revolver Meshuggah"/>
