== Etymology ==
"[[wikt:doxing|Doxing]]" is a [[neologism]] that has evolved over its brief history. It comes from a spelling alteration of the abbreviation "docs" (for "documents") and refers to "compiling and releasing a dossier of personal information on someone".<ref name=Wired>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2014/03/doxing/ |title= What Is Doxing? |first=Mat |last=Honan |date=6 March 2014 |magazine=[[Wired (website)|Wired]] |access-date=10 December 2014 }}</ref> Essentially, doxing is revealing and publicizing the records of an individual, which were previously private or difficult to obtain.

The term dox derives from the slang "dropping dox," which, according to ''[[Wired (website)|Wired]]'' writer Mat Honan, was "an old-school revenge tactic that emerged from hacker culture in 1990s". Hackers operating outside the law in that era used the breach of an opponent's [[anonymity]] as a means to expose opponents to harassment or legal repercussions.<ref name=Wired />

Consequently, doxing often comes with a negative connotation because it can be a vehicle for revenge via the violation of privacy.<ref name="theatlantic.com">{{cite magazine |title=Doxing: An Etymology |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/03/doxing-an-etymology/284283/ |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |first=Megan |last=Garber |date=6 March 2014 |access-date=10 December 2014 }}</ref>

== History ==
Initial efforts around doxing were largely related to internet discussion forums on [[Usenet]]. One of the first documented doxing events was the publication of a "Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies"<ref>
{{cite web|last=Fomin |first=Vladimir |date=15 January 1996 |title=Blacklist of Net.Nazis and Sandlot Bullies |url= https://groups.google.com/d/msg/alt.culture.usenet/i7615F8Fnak/YA_jh0BfhGYJ |work=alt.culture.usenet |via=Google Groups}}</ref> which listed names, email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses of individuals the author objected to.

Doxware is a [[cryptovirology]] attack invented by Adam Young and further developed with Moti Yung that carries out doxing extortion via [[malware]]. It was first presented at [[West Point]] in 2003. The attack is rooted in game theory and was originally dubbed "non-zero-sum games and survivable malware".<ref name="iaw2003">{{Cite conference | last1 = Young | first1 = A. | title = Non-Zero Sum Games and Survivable Malware | pages = 24–29| conference = IEEE Systems, Man and Cybernetics Society Information Assurance Workshop| year = 2003 }}</ref>

The attack is summarized in the book ''Malicious Cryptography'' as follows:

<blockquote>The attack differs from the extortion attack in the following way. In the extortion attack, the victim is denied access to its own valuable information and has to pay to get it back, where in the attack that is presented here the victim retains access to the information but its disclosure is at the discretion of the computer virus.<ref name="maliciouscrypto">{{cite book|first1=Adam |last1=Young |first2=Moti |last2=Yung |author-link2=Moti Yung |title=Malicious Cryptography: Exposing Cryptovirology |location=Indianapolis |publisher=Wiley|year=2004|isbn=0-7645-4975-8}}</ref></blockquote>

Doxware is the converse of [[ransomware]]. In a ransomware attack (originally called cryptoviral extortion), the [[malware]] encrypts the victim's data and demands payment to provide the needed decryption key. In the doxware cryptovirology attack, the attacker or malware steals the victim's data and threatens to publish it unless a fee is paid.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shivale|first=Saurabh Anandrao|title=Cryptovirology: Virus Approach|journal=International Journal of Network Security & Its Applications|year=2011|volume=3|issue=4|pages=33–46|arxiv=1108.2482|doi=10.5121/ijnsa.2011.3404|s2cid=424047}}</ref>

== Common techniques ==
Once people have been exposed through doxing, they may be targeted for harassment through methods such as harassment in-person, fake signups for mail and pizza deliveries, or through [[swatting]] (dispatching armed police to their house through spoofed tips).<ref>{{Cite web|title=What to Know About Swatting|url=https://time.com/5082806/what-is-swatting-tyler-barriss-troy-livingston/|access-date=2021-09-20|website=Time|language=en}}</ref>

A hacker may obtain an individual's dox without making the information public. A hacker may look for this information to extort or coerce a known or unknown target. A hacker may also harvest a victim's information to break into their Internet accounts or take over their social media accounts.<ref name="Wired"/>

Victims may also be shown their details as proof that they have been doxed as a form of intimidation. The perpetrator may use this fear to gain power over victims in order to extort or coerce. Doxing is therefore a standard tactic of online harassment and has been used by people associated with [[4chan]] and in the [[Gamergate controversy|Gamergate]] and [[vaccine controversies]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/10/16/doxx-dark-web-letter-bitcoin-ransom/|title=Someone is blackmailing dark web users to pay up or get doxxed|last=Mix|date=16 October 2017|work=The Next Web|access-date=6 December 2017|language=en-US}}

===Doxing of abortion providers===
{{further|Anti-abortion violence}}
In the United States, in the 1990s, [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion activists]] secured abortion providers' personal information, such as home addresses, phone numbers, and photographs, and posted them as a hit list. The courts later ruled this to be an immediate incitement to violence. The site's legend explained: "Black font (working); Greyed-out Name (wounded); Strikethrough (fatality)." The website included blood-dripping graphics, celebrated providers' deaths and incited others to kill or injure the remaining providers on the list. Between 1993 and 2016, eight abortion providers were killed by anti-abortion activists, along with at least four police officers.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/how-abortion-providers-are-living-in-the-crosshairs-20150518 |title=How Abortion Providers Are 'Living in the Crosshairs' |first=Tara |last=Murtha |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=18 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/jurisprudence/2015/05/neal_horsley_of_nuremberg_files_died_true_threats_case_reconsidered_by_supreme.html |title=Strikethrough (Fatality); The origins of online stalking of abortion providers |first1=David S. |last1=Cohen |first2=Krysten |last2=Connon |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=21 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://prochoice.org/education-and-advocacy/violence/violence-statistics-and-history/ |title=Violence Statistics & History |publisher=National Abortion Federation}}</ref>

=== Human flesh search engine ===
{{Main|Human flesh search engine}}

Starting in March 2006, the Chinese Internet phenomenon of the "Human flesh search engine"（人肉搜索）shares much in common with doxing. Specifically, it refers to distributed, sometimes deliberately [[crowdsourced]] searches for similar kinds of information through use of digital media.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article1858917.ece |title=Human flesh search engines: Chinese vigilantes that hunt victims on the web |work=The Times |first=Hannah |last=Fletcher |date=25 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/24/china-internet-generation-censorship |title=How China's internet generation broke the silence |work=The Guardian |first=Tania |last=Branigan |date=24 March 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Brancart|first=Brydon|title=After More Than a Decade, the Human Flesh Search Engine Is Still Raging Across Chinese Social Media|url=https://www.whatsonweibo.com/decade-human-flesh-search-engine-still-raging-across-chinese-social-media/|access-date=2020-11-07|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Anonymous ===
{{Main|Anonymous (group)}}

The term "dox" entered mainstream public awareness through media attention attracted by [[Anonymous (hacker group)|Anonymous]], the Internet-based group of [[Hacktivism|hacktivists]] and pranksters who make frequent use of doxing,<ref>{{cite news |last=Sheets |first=Connor Adams |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/276610/20120104/anonymous-operation-hiroshima-inside-doxing-coup.htm |title=Anonymous's Operation Hiroshima: Inside the Doxing Coup the Media Ignored |work=[[International Business Times]] |date=1 January 2012 |access-date=23 October 2012}}</ref> as well as related groups like [[Operation AntiSec|AntiSec]] and [[LulzSec]]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' has described the consequences for innocent people incorrectly accused of wrongdoing and doxed as "nightmarish".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/11/05/what-you-need-to-know-about-anonymouss-big-anti-kkk-operation/|title=What you need to know about Anonymous's big anti-KKK operation|first=Abby|last=Ohlheiser|date=5 November 2015|access-date=15 June 2016|work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

=== Journalists ===

Journalists with ''[[The Journal News]]'' of [[Westchester County, New York]], were accused of doxing gun owners in the region in a story the paper published in December 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Alfonso|first1=Fernando|title=Lawyer doxes 50 journalists who doxed gun owners|url=http://www.dailydot.com/news/christopher-fountain-journal-news-gun-owners/|work=The Daily Dot|date=26 December 2012}}</ref>

''Newsweek'' came under fire when writer Leah McGrath Goodman claimed to have revealed the identity of the anonymous creator of [[Bitcoin]], [[Satoshi Nakamoto]]. Though the source of her sleuthing was primarily the public record, she was heavily criticized for her doxing by users on Reddit.<ref name="theatlantic.com" />

The [[Satoshi Nakamoto]] case brought doxing to greater attention, particularly on platforms such as Twitter, where users questioned the ethics of doxing in journalism. Many Twitter users condemned doxing in journalism, wherein they argued that the practice was seemingly acceptable for professional journalists but wrong for anyone else. Other users discussed the effect the popularization that the concept of doxing could have on journalism in the public interest, raising questions over journalism concerning public and private figures. Many users have argued that doxing in journalism blurs the line between revealing information in the public's interest and releasing information about an individual's private life against their wishes.<ref name="america.aljazeera.com">{{cite news|title=Newsweek, Bitcoin and the ethics of 'doxxing'|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/watch/shows/the-stream/the-stream-officialblog/2014/3/7/newsweek-bitcoinandtheethicsofdoxxing.html|access-date=1 December 2015|work=[[The Stream (news programme)|The Stream]] |publisher=[[Al Jazeera America]]}}</ref><ref name="Ingram">{{cite web|last=Ingram|first=Mathew|date=6 March 2014|title=Of Bitcoin and doxxing: Is revealing Satoshi Nakamoto's identity okay because it was Newsweek and not Reddit?|url=https://gigaom.com/2014/03/06/of-bitcoin-and-doxxing-is-revealing-sakamotos-identity-okay-because-it-was-newsweek-and-not-reddit/ |work=GigaOm |access-date=1 December 2015}}</ref>

=== Curt Schilling ===
In March 2015, former [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) pitcher [[Curt Schilling]] used doxing to identify several people responsible for "Twitter [[Internet troll|troll]]" posts with obscene, sexually explicit comments about his teenage daughter. One person was suspended from his [[community college]], and another lost a part-time job with the [[New York Yankees]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Machkovech|first1=Sam|title=Former MLB pitcher, 38 Studios founder doxes his daughter's online abusers|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2015/03/former-mlb-pitcher-38-studios-founder-doxes-his-daughters-online-abusers/|work=[[ArsTechnica]]|date=3 March 2015}}</ref>

In July 2016, [[WikiLeaks]] released 300,000 e-mails called the Erdoğan emails, initially thought to be damaging to Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]]. Included in the leak was Michael Best, who uploaded Turkish citizens' information databases that WikiLeaks promoted, who came forward to say that doing so was a mistake after the site where he uploaded the information took it down. The files were removed due to privacy concerns. They included spreadsheets of private, sensitive information of what appears to be every female voter in 79 out of 81 provinces in Turkey, including their home addresses and other private information, sometimes including their cellphone numbers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/zeynep-tufekci/wikileaks-erdogan-emails_b_11158792.html|title=WikiLeaks Put Women in Turkey in Danger, for No Reason (UPDATE)|date=25 July 2016|author=Zeynep Tufekci|work=The Huffington Post}}</ref>

In July 2017, the [[United States]]' [[Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity]], which was established in May 2017 by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]]<ref>{{Cite press release|last=Trump |first=Donald |author-link=Donald Trump |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/11/presidential-executive-order-establishment-presidential-advisory|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511232125/https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/05/11/presidential-executive-order-establishment-presidential-advisory|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 May 2017|title=Presidential Executive Order on the Establishment of Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity|date=11 May 2017|publisher=[[White House]]|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trumps-voter-fraud-commission-is-facing-a-tough-data-challenge/|title=Trump's Voter Fraud Commission Is Facing A Tough Data Challenge|last=Koerth-Baker|first=Maggie|date=7 July 2017|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|language=en-US}}</ref> to investigate his controversial allegation of [[Electoral fraud|voter fraud]],<ref>{{cite news|author=Lowry, Brian|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article149910457.html|title=Civil rights groups fume about Trump's choice of Kris Kobach for voter fraud panel|date=11 May 2017|work=[[The Kansas City Star]]}}</ref> published a 112-page document of unredacted emails of public comment on its work, which included both critics and some supporters of the Commission. The Commission included the personal details of those critics, such as names, emails, phone numbers and home addresses. Most of the commenters who wrote to the White House expressed concern about publication of their personal information, with one person writing, "DO NOT RELEASE ANY OF MY VOTER DATA PERIOD." Despite this, that person's name and email address were published by the commission.<ref name=NPR>{{cite web |last=Neuman |first=Scott |date=14 July 2017 |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/07/14/537282309/vote-fraud-commission-releases-public-comments-email-addresses-and-all |title=Vote Fraud Commission Releases Public Comments, Email Addresses And All |work=The Two-Way |publisher=[[National Public Radio]]}}</ref><ref name=Slate>{{cite magazine |last=Politi |first=Daniel |date=15 July 2017 |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/07/15/white_house_publishes_names_emails_phone_numbers_home_addresses_of_critics.html |title=White House Publishes Names, Emails, Phone Numbers, Home Addresses of Critics |magazine=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}</ref>

This act drew criticism from Theresa Lee, a staff attorney for the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]'s Voting Rights Project, who stated, "This cavalier attitude toward the public's personal information is especially concerning given the commission's request for sensitive data on every registered voter in the country."<ref name=NPR/><ref name=Slate/> The White House defended the personal information publication, noting that everyone was warned that might happen. However, former Deputy Secretary of Labor Chris Lu stated that regardless of the legality, the White House has a moral obligation to protect sensitive data, saying, "Whether or not it's legal to disclose this personal information, it's clearly improper, and no responsible White House would do this."<ref name=Slate/>

Federal agencies often solicit and release public comments on proposed legislation. Regulations.gov, which is designated for public comments, includes a detailed set of guidelines explaining how to submit comments, what type of personal information is collected, and how that information may be used, stating, "Some agencies may require that you include personal information, such as your name and email address, on the comment form. The Securities and Exchange Commission, for instance, warns commenters to 'submit only information that you wish to make available publicly.'" Another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, tells commenters that "published comments include the commenter's last name and state/country as well as the entire text of the comment. Please do not include any sensitive or confidential information." However, The White House does not appear to have issued any such public guidelines or warnings before many of the emails were sent. Marc Lotter, Press Secretary to Mike Pence, stated, "These are public comments, similar to individuals appearing before commission to make comments and providing name before making comments. The Commission’s Federal Register notice asking for public comments and its website make clear that information 'including names and contact information' sent to this email address may be released."<ref>{{cite news |last=Ingraham |first=Christopher |date=14 July 2017 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2017/07/14/white-house-releases-sensitive-personal-information-of-voters-worried-about-their-sensitive-personal-information/ |title=White House releases sensitive personal information of voters worried about their sensitive personal information |work=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

=== Democratic U.S. House of Representatives intern ===
On 3 October 2018, Jackson Cosko, a House fellow for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] party, was arrested by the [[United States Capitol Police|U.S. Capitol Police]] (USCP). He allegedly posted private, identifying information of several Senators to Wikipedia. According to the USCP, the personal information of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senators [[Lindsey Graham]], [[Mike Lee (American politician)|Mike Lee]] and [[Orrin Hatch]] was anonymously posted to [[Wikipedia]] the week before on Thursday 27 September 2018. The information included home addresses and phone numbers. All three lawmakers are with the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]]. The alleged doxing occurred during the hearing of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] nominee [[Judge Brett Kavanaugh]]. Cosko was initially charged with witness tampering, threats in interstate communications, unauthorized access of a government computer, identity theft, second degree burglary and unlawful entry. Cosko was fired after his arrest. He worked with Democratic Rep. [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] (D-TX), Sen. [[Dianne Feinstein]] (D-Calif), Sen. [[Maggie Hassan]] (D-N.H.), and former Sen. [[Barbara Boxer]] (D-Calif).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/politics/cops-probe-doxxing-of-gop-senators-as-left-wing-escalates-confrontational-tactics|title=Cops probe doxxing of GOP senators, as left-wing escalates confrontational tactics|last=Shaw|first=Adam|date=4 October 2018|work=[[Fox News]]|access-date=4 October 2018|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/409878-ex-house-intern-arrested-in-doxing-of-gop-senators|title=Ex-House intern charged with 'doxing' GOP senators during Kavanaugh hearing|last=Folley|first=Aris|date=4 October 2018|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|access-date=4 October 2018|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/jackson-cosko-arrested-today-maggie-hassan-former-staffer-capitol-police-2018-10-03/|title=Former Senate staffer arrested for allegedly doxing senator|date=4 October 2018|work=[[CBS News]]|access-date=4 October 2018|language=en}}</ref> Conviction of all six charges might have resulted in Cosko facing up to 20 years in prison.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/public-safety/democratic-ex-staffer-contests-charges-he-posted-personal-data-on-gop-senators-threatened-witness-in-doxing/2018/10/04/88842844-c806-11e8-b2b5-79270f9cce17_story.html|title=Democratic ex-staffer contests charges he posted personal data on GOP senators, threatened witness in doxing|first=Spencer S.|last=Hsu|date=4 October 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|language=en|access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> However, in June 2019, he was sentenced by Judge [[Thomas F.

==Legal remedies==
{{Globalize|section|date=February 2020}}
There are currently few legal remedies for the victims of doxing.<ref>{{harvnb|Lindvall|2019|pages=3, 12}}</ref>  In the United States, there are currently two federal laws that could potentially address the problem of doxing: the Interstate Communications Statute and the Interstate Stalking Statute.{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=8}}  However, as one scholar has argued, "[t]hese statutes...are woefully inadequate to prevent doxing because their terms are underinclusive and they are rarely enforced".{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=8}}  The Interstate Communications Statute, for example, "only criminalizes explicit threats to kidnap or injure a person".{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=9}}  But in many instances of doxing, a doxer may never convey an explicit threat to kidnap or injure, but the victim could still have good reason to be terrified.{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=9}}  And the Interstate Stalking Statute "is rarely enforced and it serves only as a hollow protection from online harassment".{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=10}}  To illustrate, over three million people are stalked over the internet each year, yet only three people are charged under the Interstate Stalking Statute.{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=10}} Accordingly, "[t]his lack of federal enforcement means that the States must step in if doxing is to be reduced".{{sfn|Lindvall|2019|page=10}}
==Criminal Law==
===Mainland China===
From March 1, 2020, the People’s Republic of China’s "Regulations on the Ecological Governance of Online Information Content" has been implemented, clarifying that users and producers of online information content services and platforms must not engage in online violence, doxing, deep forgery, data fraud, account manipulation and other Illegal activities.<ref>{{cite news |title=《网络信息内容生态治理规定》明确不得开展人肉搜索、流量造假等违法活动 |url=http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2019-12/21/content_5462826.htm |access-date=2020-02-29 |agency=新华社 |publisher=中国政府网 |date=2019-12-21 |archive-date=2020-11-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201123193205/http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2019-12/21/content_5462826.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>
====Hong Kong====
As of 2021, it is a criminal offense in [[Hong Kong]] to dox, where doxing is defined as releasing private or non-public information on a person for the purposes of "threatening, intimidation, harassment or to cause psychological harm". Persons convicted under this statute are liable to imprisonment for up to 5 years, and a fine of HK$1,000,000 (US$128,591.72).<ref>{{cite news|title =  Hong Kong introduces new legal amendments to outlaw doxxing |url=https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3133087/hong-kong-introduces-new-legal-amendments-outlaw-doxxing|access-date=2021-07-31}}</ref>

===South Korea===
South Korea stands as one of few countries with a criminal statute that specifically addresses doxing. Article 49 of "Act on promotion of information and communications network utilization, and information protection" prohibits unlawful collection and dissemination of private information such as full name, birth date, address, likeliness, and any other information that is deemed sufficient to identify specific person(s) when viewed in summation, regardless of intent.<ref>{{Cite web|title=대한민국 영문법령|url=https://elaw.klri.re.kr/kor_service/lawView.do?hseq=50484&lang=ENG|access-date=1 August 2020|website=elaw.klri.re.kr}}</ref> In practice, however, due to the ambiguous nature of “unlawful collection” of private information in said statute, legal actions are often based upon article 44 from the same act, which prohibits insulting an individual with language derogatory or profane, and defamation of an individual through the dissemination of either misinformation or privileged factual information that may potentially damage an individual's reputation or honor (which often occurs in a doxing incident). It is important to note that this particular clause enforces harsher maximum sentences than a “traditional” defamation statute existing in the Korean criminal code and was originally enacted partially in response to the rise in celebrity suicides due to cyberbullying.
