'''Loud''' were a [[hard rock]] band with [[alternative rock]], [[gothic rock]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] influences, formed in [[Bradford]], England in 1989.

The band was founded by guitarist Chris McLaughlin, following his stint in [[New Model Army (band)|New Model Army]] and former Excalibur (P.A.D.D. Hardware) Bassist Martin Hawthorn, second guitarist Colin Clarkson and drummer Ricky Howard (formerly of Happiness AD) completed the line-up.

==History==
The group's debut album, released in 1990 on [[China Records]], was called ''D Generation''. It was co-produced by J. Martin Rex and [[Jaz Coleman]] of [[Killing Joke]]. ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine voted it one of their twenty best albums of 1990.<ref>[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/kerrang.html "''Kerrang'' Albums of the Year 1990"]. Rocklist Music.</ref>

The band subsequently went out on the road in late 1990, playing some live dates as support to former [[Duran Duran]] guitarist [[Andy Taylor (guitarist)|Andy Taylor]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Tawfik, Yehia |date=8 June 2010 |url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/359225-loud/images/1331281 |title=Loud - Winter tour itinerary, 1990 |publisher=Songkick.com |accessdate=2011-10-13}}</ref> These were followed by support slots with [[Killing Joke]] at the [[London Astoria]] on 31 January 1991<ref>[http://www.songkick.com/artists/359225-loud/posters "Killing Joke / Loud concert poster, 1991"].

In July 1991, the band played at the second annual Cumbria Rock Festival at [[Derwent Park]] stadium in [[Workington]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Tawfik, Yehia |date=8 June 2010 |url=http://www.songkick.com/festivals/101281-cumbria-rock-1991/id/5737331-cumbria-rock-1991-1991/performances/10340991-loud/images/1331326 |title=Cumbria Rock 1991 - ticket stub |publisher=Songkick.com |accessdate=2011-10-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008024016/http://www.songkick.com/festivals/101281-cumbria-rock-1991/id/5737331-cumbria-rock-1991-1991/performances/10340991-loud/images/1331326 |archivedate=8 October 2011 }}</ref>

Hawthorn and Clarkson left the band in late 1991 and were replaced by bassist Stuart Morrow (formerly of New Model Army) and guitarist Paul "Etch" Etchells (formerly of [[Ghost Dance (band)|Ghost Dance]]). This revamped line-up recorded the band's second album, ''Psyche 21'', which was released in 1992. The album was produced by [[Reinhold Mack]]. It received some favourable write-ups in the contemporary music press, including a rave review from journalist Valerie Potter in the Australian ''Hot Metal'' magazine and a 5-out-of-5 score in ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' magazine from reviewer Anthony Noguera.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tawfik, Yehia|date= 8 June 2010 |url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/359225-loud/images/1331291 |title=Promotional poster for 'Psyche 21' album release, 1992 |publisher=Songkick.com |accessdate=2011-10-13}}</ref> In spite of the album's success, the band split up shortly afterwards.
