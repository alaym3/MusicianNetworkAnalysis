Blaine attended Dalton Academy and was lead singer of its glee club, [[The Dalton Academy Warblers]]. Blaine initially served as a friend and mentor for Kurt, the bullied gay member of the Warblers' rival glee club, New Directions. Chemistry between the two characters, combined with fan support for the potential couple, led series co-creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] to pair them romantically onscreen. At the beginning of the [[Glee (season 3)|third season]], Blaine transfers to McKinley High and joins New Directions; concurrently, Criss was promoted from recurring guest star to the show's main cast.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/09/glee-recap-back-to-school-and-basics-in-the-season-3-premiere.html|title={{-'}}Glee' recap: Back to school (and basics) in the Season 3 premiere|first=Amy|last=Reiter|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 21, 2011|access-date=September 21, 2011|archive-date=September 25, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110925065014/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2011/09/glee-recap-back-to-school-and-basics-in-the-season-3-premiere.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In the subsequent seasons, Blaine goes off to college and later returns to Dalton to become the vocal director of the Warblers. In the final season, he marries his long-time love, Kurt. Discussing public response to his character, Criss stated that he particularly enjoyed comments from "people from parts of the world who are maybe not as exposed to certain ideologies", but had reconsidered their stance on relationships and human rights as a result of the Blaine and Kurt storyline. He called this response "phenomenal" and said, "I was a straight kid growing up in a very gay community and it's something that I've had to watch so many friends have to struggle with and have no place to go to identify in kind of a grander media culture. To be a small piece of that machine is incredibly wonderful."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/darren-criss-glee-teenage-dream?page=0%2C1|title=Interview: Darren Criss Humbly Calls Himself "Last Grain of Sand"|last=Jensen|first=Michael|date=January 18, 2011|work=[[AfterEllen.com and AfterElton.com|AfterElton.com]]|publisher=[[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]]|access-date=April 15, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123164022/http://www.afterelton.com/people/2011/01/darren-criss-glee-teenage-dream?page=0%2C1|archive-date=January 23, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
