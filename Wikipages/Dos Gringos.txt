'''Dos Gringos''', an Air Force fighter pilot band, was originally formed by two [[US Air Force]] [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16]] pilots, Chris "Snooze" Kurek and Rob "Trip" Raymond in 2001.  The group has put out four albums about their experiences as fighter pilots and military life. The band is popular in the Air Force, fighter pilot community, and among fans of military aviation worldwide.<ref name="avgeek">{{cite web |url=https://www.avgeekery.com/badass-song-favorite-fighter-jets-written-real-fighter-pilots-video/ |title=This Badass Song About Their Favorite Fighter Jets Was Written By Real Fighter Pilots / VIDEO |author=Wendell Barnhouse |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref> Many of their songs are highly vulgar and satirical.

==History==
The band was formed when Chris Kurek and Rob Raymond were stationed at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico. They wrote several of their first songs together while deployed to Kuwait during [[Operation Southern Watch]] and Operation Iraqi Freedom. They performed some songs at music functions for their squadron, and were encouraged by their squadron commander to record and publish their work. Shortly after they returned from deployment, they recorded and released their first album, ''Live at the Sand Trap''.

The band achieved more viral popularity in the Air Force with their satirical song "I'm a Pilot," which depicts an arrogant, disrespectful pilot talking to his maintenance crew. <ref name="watm">{{cite web |url=https://www.wearethemighty.com/articles/meet-the-f-16-pilots-who-turned-their-wartime-experiences-into-hilarious-songs |title=Meet the F-16 pilots who turned their wartime experiences into hilarious songs |last=Harold C. |first=Hutchinson |publisher=Mighty Networks |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref>

==Musical Style==
Dos Gringos have incorporated a variety of different styles into their music, from more folk-style ballads like "2's Blind" to songs with more aggressive, metal-style instrumentation like ''SOS''.

Generally, the songs are sung from the perspective of the band members themselves, lamenting the rising demand for [[Unmanned aerial vehicle]] pilots and complaining about the ease of use of [[Joint Direct Attack Munition|JDAM]] bombs. One of their most popular songs is about [[Jeremiah Weed]],  a bourbon liqueur that is a part of Air Force fighter pilot culture.<ref name="fightersweep">{{cite web |url=https://fightersweep.com/1233/fighter-pilot-traditions-jeremiah-weed/ |title=Fighter Pilot Traditions: Jeremiah Weed |author=Scott Wolff |publisher=Hurricane Group |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref><ref name="aviation.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.aviation.com/general-aviation/aviations-five-rockin-bands/ |title=Aviation’s Five Most Rockin’ Bands |last=Charlton |first=Jonathan |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref>

==Inactivity and further projects==
Following the release of ''El Cuatro'' in 2012, the band has not released any significant material. Their last known performance was in 2013 at [[Pensacola]] for a meeting of the [https://www.river-rats.org/ Red River Valley Fighter Pilots Association].<ref name="facebook">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/Dos-Gringos-313528452060289/ |title=Dos Gringos |author=Dos Gringos |date=2013-04-09 |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref>

Chris Kurek and Rob Raymond later joined with Erik Brine, an Air Force reservist and C-17 pilot, to form a new project called [https://operationencore.org/ Operation Encore], which seeks to help veterans and active-duty military develop their musical talents and work within the music industry.<ref name="watm" /><ref name="encore">{{cite web |url=https://operationencore.org/about-us |title=About Us |author=Operation Encore |publisher=Operation Encore |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Gibbs |first=Ryan |url=https://www.jamestownpress.com/articles/air-force-reservist-hits-high-note-with-music-venture/ |title=Air Force Reservist hits high note with music venture |work=The Jamestown Press |date=2018-05-31 |accessdate=2019-05-17 }}</ref> Chris Kurek indicated in a 2017 interview that he would be interested in producing another Dos Gringos album.<ref name="watm" />
