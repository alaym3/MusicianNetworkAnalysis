==History==
===Formation, EPs and ''The Adversary'' (2006–2010)===
[[File:Thy Art Is Murder Summerblast 2014 (32).JPG|thumb|Founding member and guitarist Sean Delander]]
Formed in 2006, in the Western Sydney locality of [[Blacktown]], the group originally consisted of vocalist Brendan van Ryn, guitarists Gary Markowski and Sean Delander, bassist Josh King and drummer Lee Stanton. Building on a loyal following among fans of deathcore in Western Sydney, they recorded a three track demo ''This Hole Isn't Deep Enough for the Twelve of You''. They returned to the studio in 2008 to record the EP ''[[Infinite Death]]'', which gained them further attention for van Ryn's [[Sacrilege|sacrilegious]] and [[Misogyny|misogynistic]] lyrics and song titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d922/rm2182246.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419062746/http://uk-online.uni-koeln.de/remarks/d922/rm2182246.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=19 April 2012 |access-date=27 July 2017}}</ref> The EP reached number 10 on the [[AIR Charts]].<ref name="acaciaguitars.com"/>

Following two years of relentless national touring, it was announced in 2008 that van Ryn was about to depart from the group. It was initially claimed that he left the group due to creative differences and an inability to keep up with their evolving death metal sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pHCpLDQ5I0k |title=METAL DOWN UNDER – Thy Art Is Murder |publisher=YouTube |date=19 August 2010 |access-date=17 August 2012}}</ref> However it was later claimed in 2013 that van Ryn was replaced because "he couldn't sing [anymore] and he had a massive attitude problem."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.loudmag.com.au/content/thy-art-is-murder-hate-worldwide |title=Thy Art is Murder: Hate Worldwide |publisher=Loud Online |date=14 May 2013 |access-date=20 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820220015/http://www.loudmag.com.au/content/thy-art-is-murder-hate-worldwide |archive-date=20 August 2014  }}</ref> Thy Art Is Murder searched for a year for a new vocalist, until finding Chris "CJ" McMahon from Sydney [[metalcore]] band Vegas in Ruins. The band were so impressed with his [[death growl]] vocals that he was incepted into the band during 2009. Bassist Mick Lowe replaced King shortly before the band began tracking demos for their first full-length album ''[[The Adversary (Thy Art Is Murder album)|The Adversary]]''. The demos recorded in 2009 included early versions of the songs "Engineering the Antichrist" and "Cowards Throne". In 2010, the group began recording the album's final recording sessions and released the album on 16 July 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/thy_art_is_murder/the_adversary/index.html |title=The Adversary Review &#124; Thy Art Is Murder &#124; Compact Discs &#124; Reviews @ |publisher=Ultimate-guitar.com |access-date=17 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/38643/Thy-Art-Is-Murder-The-Adversary/ |title=Thy Art Is Murder – The Adversary (album review ) |publisher=Sputnikmusic.com |date=21 August 2010 |access-date=17 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/release/album/thy_art_is_murder/the_adversary/ |title=The Adversary by Thy Art Is Murder (Album, Deathcore): Reviews, Ratings, Credits, Song list |publisher=Rateyourmusic.com |access-date=17 April 2015}}</ref>

2011 saw further line-up changes, notably the departure of founding member and lead guitarist Gary Markowski. Delander decided to switch duties from guitar to bass, making way for Andy Marsh and Tom Brown to join on guitar.

On 11 April 2013, [[Sumerian Records]] officially announced that the group had just lost the opening support on the United States' annual [[Summer Slaughter Tour]].
