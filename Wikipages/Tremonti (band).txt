'''Tremonti''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band founded and fronted by lead vocalist and guitarist [[Mark Tremonti]], best known as the lead guitarist of rock bands [[Creed (band)|Creed]] and [[Alter Bridge]]. The band also consists of rhythm guitarist [[Eric Friedman]], bassist Tanner Keegan and drummer Ryan Bennett. Bassist [[Wolfgang Van Halen]] and drummer Garrett Whitlock are former members of the band. Mark Tremonti's Creed and Alter Bridge bandmate [[Brian Marshall]] was also a touring member in 2012.

What originally started as a Mark Tremonti solo project evolved into a fully fledged band that has released five studio albums: ''[[All I Was]]'' in July 2012, ''[[Cauterize (album)|Cauterize]]'' in June 2015, ''[[Dust (Tremonti album)|Dust]]'' in April 2016, ''[[A Dying Machine]]'' in June 2018 and ''[[Marching in Time]]'' in September 2021. The band's music is a departure from Mark Tremonti's main bands, featuring more of a [[speed metal]] influence with [[melodic]] vocals.

==History==

Tremonti began expressing interest in releasing a solo album in 2010. "The bands are so different," he said of his two current main projects. "And I write so much. I'm going to do a solo record because there are some songs that I'd hate to think wouldn't see the light of day because they don't work for Creed or Alter Bridge."{{cite quote|date=January 2017}} He is playing guitar and singing lead on all of the songs himself, and former [[Submersed]] members Eric Friedman and Garrett Whitlock perform on the record as well. Tremonti described the music as "melody driven," and in a May 2011 interview, Tremonti said that it would be a "heavier-sounding" thrash metal album. He later said that the album is "probably heavier than either Creed or Alter Bridge," and that it would have "lots of soloing."{{cite quote|date=January 2017}}
 
Tremonti's first album, ''[[All I Was]]'' was released on July 17, 2012 under the label FRET12 Records. "You Waste Your Time" was released as the first single from the album.  One day after its release, the song reached number 10 on the iTunes Rock Songs Chart, and Tremonti's live music video for it premiered on May 17, 2012, on Noisecreep.
 
The band originally consisted of Friedman and Whitlock alongside Alter Bridge and Creed bassist Brian Marshall playing bass guitar as a touring musician. The band performed its first solo concert at The Social in Orlando, Florida, on July 17, 2012, with the performance filmed for a future video release. Wolfgang Van Halen replaced Brian Marshall as a touring bassist in September 2012.

In 2013 Mark Tremonti regrouped with [[Alter Bridge]] to record the album ''[[Fortress (Alter Bridge album)|Fortress]]''. After a tour, in 2014, Tremonti began recording their second album with Wolfgang Van Halen playing bass. On March 3, 2015, Tremonti released a sample of the song "Radical Change" whilst revealing the album title ''[[Cauterize (album)|Cauterize]]'' and the track listing for their second album. On Tuesday, March 17, 2015, Tremonti released another song preview for the track "Flying Monkeys" and also gave a concrete release date of June 9, 2015 for ''Cauterize''. On March 20, 2015, Tremonti unveiled via Twitter that the first single, titled "Another Heart", would be released Tuesday, March 24, 2015. On March 23, 2015, the single Another Heart was made available for streaming via FRET12. On March 27, 2015, the artwork for ''Cauterize'' was revealed, and it was revealed that it will be the first of two albums to be released as the two albums were recorded together. The second single off the new album, titled "Flying Monkeys", was released in the US on May 15, 2015.

The band's third album titled ''[[Dust (Tremonti album)|Dust]]'' was released on April 29, 2016. The album was recorded at the same time as their previous album, and Tremonti said he "wanted to make sure both albums flowed dynamically. If there were two slow moody songs, [he]'d put one on each album, same thing if there were two really heavy aggressive songs, [he] would split them up evenly. There's isn't a specific theme to one or the other. Each record is mixed"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternativenation.net/interview-mark-tremonti/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926015115/http://www.alternativenation.net/interview-mark-tremonti/ |archive-date=September 26, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and that "it's definitely not the 'b-sides' of this album".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/mark-tremonti-says-forthcoming-dust-album-is-definitely-not-the-b-sides-of-cauterize/|title=MARK TREMONTI Says Forthcoming 'Dust' Album Is 'Definitely Not The B-Sides' Of 'Cauterize'|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 12, 2015|access-date=January 13, 2017}}</ref>

Mark Tremonti, in February, announced the band's fourth studio album ''[[A Dying Machine]]'' to be released on June 8, 2018 through [[Napalm Records]]. The album is produced by [[Michael Baskette]], who produced all the band's previous albums and the last four Alter Bridge records as well. The listening party and performance event for ''A Dying Machine'' were both held on May 12. Tremonti supported Iron Maiden on their European tour in June 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/tremonti_releasing_new_album_a_dying_machine_later_this_year.html|title=Tremonti Releasing New Album 'A Dying Machine' Later This Year|access-date=February 5, 2018}}</ref> In late 2018, drummer Garrett Whitlock didn't tour with the band due to a necessary leave of absence for undisclosed personal reasons.
