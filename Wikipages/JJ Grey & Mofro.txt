'''JJ Grey & Mofro'''  (formerly '''Mofro''') is an American [[Southern soul]]-[[Southern rock|rock]] band<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jjgrey.com/about|title=ABOUT {{!}} www.jjgrey.com|website=www.jjgrey.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-10}}</ref> from Jacksonville, Florida.

==History==
===Early career===
The early days of '''Mofro''' can be traced back to the mid-nineties when John Higginbotham aka "JJ Grey" and Daryl Hance signed with a United Kingdom label and played shows in Europe as Mofro Magic.<ref name=relixarticle>{{cite web|last=Greenhaus|first=Mike|title=JJ Grey, Swamps, Soul, & Revival|url=http://forums.mofrofans.com/file?id=1083235|work=relix article}}</ref>  Grey and Hance met in their hometown of [[Jacksonville, Florida]] while working for an air conditioning company and developed a friendship through music. Their first band together was a rock band called Faith Nation followed by a funk band called Alma Zuma.<ref name=relixarticle /> The deal with the record label in [[London]] fell through, and Grey and Hance returned to their native [[Jacksonville]] and formed Mofro, then signed with Fog City Records in 2001.<ref name=fogcity>{{cite web|title=Fog City Records presents:Mofro|url=http://www.fogworld.com/mofro/bio.html|work=Fog City Records}}</ref>

The name "Mofro" was coined by JJ Grey as an explanation of the sound that the band made.<ref name=relixarticle /> Grey says the word was originally a nickname that a co-worker gave him and Grey adopted it as the band name because it "sounded southern." Grey later changed the band name to "JJ Grey & Mofro" when his grandmother asked him if he was ashamed to use his own name.<ref>from an interview with JJ Grey on [http://americanamusicshow.com/episode233 Americana Music Show #233], published on February 16, 2015.</ref>

===''Blackwater'' (2001) and ''Lochloosa'' (2004)===
The first studio album released by Mofro was ''Blackwater'', released in 2001.<ref name="fogcity"/>  The album is full of songs inspired by the surroundings of where JJ Grey grew up, such as "Blackwater" and "Florida".<ref name="fogcity"/>  A car accident in late 2001 involving several members of Mofro slowed things down for the band and it was not until 2004 until they released their next album Lochloosa.<ref name=relixarticle />  This album continued to deliver songs about where Grey grew up and the industrial progress that continues to plague the natural beauty of the areas around [[Lochloosa Lake]] and [[Orange Lake (Florida)|Orange Lake]].<ref name="fogcity"/>  The title track, "Lochloosa", describes the changing landscape in northern Florida and JJ Grey's soulfulness and deep beliefs come through in the song.  ''Lochloosa'' would be the last album with Fog City Records and the last album under the name Mofro.<ref name=relixarticle />

===''Country Ghetto'' (2007) and ''Orange Blossoms'' (2008)===
In 2007, JJ Grey & Mofro became the new name of the band under new record label Alligator, and the album ''Country Ghetto'' was released.<ref name=relixarticle />  The album featured slower, more soulful songs such as "The Sun is Shining Down", along with faster, and more [[rock and roll]] type songs such as "War" and "Country Ghetto".  The song "The Sun is Shining Down" is featured in the opening scene of the Season 3 Finale of House of Cards. The next studio album was ''Orange Blossoms'', released in 2008.<ref name=relixarticle />  Orange Blossoms features songs such as "On Fire" and "Wylf (What You're Looking For)" that revolve around sexual themes more so than previous songs performed by JJ Grey & Mofro.

===''Georgia Warhorse'' (2010) and ''This River'' (2013)===
Their fifth studio album is ''Georgia Warhorse'' that was released in 2010.<ref name=nytimes>{{cite news|last=Chinen|first=Nate|title=JJ Grey and Mofro|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/arts/music/23choice.html|work=Critics Choice|publisher=New York Times}}</ref>  The album is named after a cricket that is found in northern Florida that is known for its strength despite its small size.<ref name=relixarticle />  The album features songs such as "The Sweetest Thing" that includes vocals from [[Toots Hibbert]], from Toots and The Maytals.<ref name="nytimes"/>  It also features [[Derek Trucks]], from [[The Allman Brothers Band]] and The Tedeschi Trucks Band, on the song "Lullaby" playing slide guitar.<ref name="nytimes"/>  Daryl Hance, who was an original member of Mofro, left the band in 2010 before this album was made to pursue a solo career.  Hance was replaced on the guitar by Andrew Trube.<ref name=relixarticle />  JJ Grey & Mofro released ''This River'' in April 2013.  The album features familiar upbeat songs such as "Florabama, "99 Shades of Crazy", and "Your Lady, She's Shady".

===''Ol' Glory'' (2015)===
