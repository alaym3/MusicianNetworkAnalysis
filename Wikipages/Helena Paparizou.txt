'''Helena Paparizou''' ({{IPA-sv|hɛˈlêːna papaˈrɪ̌tːsʊ, -ˈrǐːsʊ|lang}}; {{lang-el|Έλενα Παπαρίζου|Élena Paparízou}}, {{IPA-el|ˈelena papaˈrizu|pron}}; born 31 January 1982) is a Greek-Swedish singer, songwriter and television personality. Born and raised in [[Sweden]] to Greek parents, she enrolled in various arts schools before launching a career in Sweden in 1999 as a member of the [[laïko]] (Greek folk music) and [[Eurodance]] duo [[Antique (band)|Antique]], who participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2001]] and afterwards became popular.

Antique disbanded in 2003, and Paparizou signed a solo recording contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]], releasing the chart-topping debut single "[[Anapandites Kliseis]]" and album ''[[Protereotita]]'' (2004), with emphasis on laïko, [[pop music|pop]], and [[dance music|dance]] sounds, but at first had modest sales. In 2005, she represented Greece in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2005|Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[My Number One]]", which she won. It was the first Greek win in the contest's history and transformed her career. Her album was subsequently certified double platinum by the [[IFPI Greece|International Federation of the Phonographic Industry of Greece]]. Paparizou attempted a career beyond Greece with English-language material, charting in a few countries abroad. Her three subsequent albums ''[[Iparhi Logos]]'' (2006), ''[[The Game of Love (album)|The Game of Love]]'' (2006) and ''[[Vrisko To Logo Na Zo]]'' (2008) all peaked at number one in Greece and reached platinum sales. Her fifth studio album ''[[Giro Apo T' Oneiro]]'' (2010) was also certified platinum. Paparizou's final release before she left Sony Music, ''[[Greatest Hits & More (Elena Paparizou album)|Greatest Hits & More]]'', was released in 2011 and included "[[Baby It's Over]]", her biggest hit until 2016. Her biggest hit to date is ''An Me Dis Na Kleo'' ballad song feat [[Anastasios Rammos]] released in 2017 exceeding 30 million views on [[YouTube]].

Paparizou established herself as a [[teen idol]], particularly among young girls. She has endorsed the brands [[Nokia]] and [[PepsiCo|Ivi]]. For the period 2013-2015, she advertised hair colour products for Koleston company in Greece. In the 2010s she tried to move into television as a judge on [[Dancing on Ice (Greek TV series)|''Dancing on Ice'']] (2011) and as a contestant on [[Let's Dance 2012|''Let's Dance'']] (2012). Since 2016 until 2021, Paparizou had been a judge at ''[[The Voice of Greece]]''. Paparizou lived with her fiancé and manager Toni Mavridis from 1999 until their separation in 2011.

Paparizou has been awarded three [[IFPI Greece#Arion Music Awards (2002–2007)|Arion Music Awards]], a [[European Border Breakers Award]], 30 [[MAD Video Music Awards]]{{mdash}}more than any other Greek artist{{mdash}}and an [[MTV Europe Music Award]].

===Influences===

Paparizou has said that her parents had no musical background and the only person in her family who sang was her paternal grandmother, who inspired Paparizou to sing. Paparizou's first musical experiences were with international music{{mdash}}predominantly [[musical theatre|musical]]; her musical roots are in traditional Greek music such as [[laiko]] and rebetiko because she was exposed to the music of [[Vassilis Tsitsanis]], [[Markos Vamvakaris]], [[Stelios Kazantzidis]], Mimis Plaisas, and Giannis Spanos.<ref name="number one dvd">Elena Paparizou ''Number One'' DVD</ref> As a child, Paparizou considered those genres to be distant and old-fashioned, and associated them with her summer holidays in Greece.<ref name="kafes1"/> In her teenage years, she listened to a broad range of music, including [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[soul music|soul]].<ref name="mera me ti mera">''Mera Me Ti Mera'' liner notes.

Airdate: 7 October 2006</ref> Later, she was influenced by her frequent collaborator Paschalis Terzis, who taught her to improve her technical vocal skills. Paparizou has also stated that she was a big fan of the Eurovision Song Contest for years before she first participated in 2001.

===Music and themes===
During her solo career, Paparizou has changed her musical style from laiko, to pop and rock-inspired styles on a whim.<ref name="chartshow"/> Some critics attribute this to a lack of personal style and following trends for commercial success rather than as an artistic expression.<ref name="musiccorner.gr"/><ref name="vtlnz avopolis">{{cite web|url=http://www.avopolis.gr/greek/albums/default.asp?ID=4654 |date=June 2008 |script-title=el:Βρίσκω Το Λόγο Να Ζω |last=Kalamaris |first=Makis |publisher=Avoplis |language=el |access-date=10 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102201456/http://www.avopolis.gr/greek/albums/default.asp?ID=4654 |archive-date= 2 January 2009  }}</ref> Paparizou has been known to follow the trends of international female pop stars;<ref name="musiccorner.gr"/> music critics have compared songs like "The Light in Our Soul" to Celine Dion, "Let's Get Wild" to [[Anastacia]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccorner.gr/nees_kyklof/05/paparizou.html |title=Έλενα Παπαρίζου "Euro edition" |publisher=Musiccorner.gr |access-date=3 May 2010}}</ref> "Gigolo" and "Carpe Diem (Seize the Day)" to [[Shakira]],<ref name="athens 24">{{cite web|url=http://www.athens24.gr/going-out/music/cd-critic/news_detail.html?id=15667|script-title=el:ΕΛΕΝΑ ΠΑΠΑΡΙΖΟΥ: Υπάρχει λόγος|publisher=Athens 24|language=el|access-date=19 April 2012}}</ref><ref name="TGOL MC review">{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccorner.gr/nees_kyklof/06/paparizou_02.html|title=HELENA PAPARIZOU: "The game of love"|last=Zervas|first=Pavlos|publisher=Music Corner|language=el|access-date=19 April 2012}}</ref> "Somebody's Burning (Put the Fire Out)" to [[Beyoncé Knowles]],<ref name="TGOL MC review"/> and "Dancing Without Music" to [[Kylie Minogue]] c.

Similar to Antique's work, all of Paparizou's albums have included cover versions and translations. Following Antique's blending of traditional Greek music with Nordic disco sounds,  Paparizou's debut solo album ''Protereotita'' focused on pop sounds and laiko, and the songs were directed towards the club market. Giorgos Mastorakis of Music Corner stated that despite the image change, the album was similar to those of Antique, being described as "pop moments (with keen laiko&nbsp;...&nbsp;'garnish')". The album featured songs from both Greek and Swedish writers, which according to Mastorakis, led to the album's sound varying. The stylistically interesting songs from the album includes the title track, which followed an R&B style, while the song "Katse Kala" was described as having an "original sound."<ref name="protereotita mc review">{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccorner.gr/nees_kyklof/04/paparizou.html |title=Έλενα Παπαρίζου "Προτεραιότητα" |publisher=Musiccorner.gr |access-date=3 May 2010}}</ref>

Following her Eurovision win, Paparizou's popularity increased and she was often promoted as a pop singer by the media. In his review of the ''Euro Edition'' of ''Protereotita'', Pavlos Zervas of Music Corner was impressed with the album and said that its contemporary style could potentially be an international hit, supporting the singer more so in English-language recordings. In his review of ''Iparhi Logos'', Zervas said that apart from Sakis Rouvas{{mdash}}Greece's pop performer{{mdash}}Paparizou was the only artist supporting the pop/dance genre so well in Greece. He also said that anything that she chose to sing would become a hit. He used Paparizou to illustrate that big name producers like [[Giorgos Theofanous]] and [[Phoebus (songwriter)|Phoebus]] are not needed to create hits. Zervas said that the numerous covers were the album's strong point, while "Gigolo" was characterized by "witty" lyrics in an overall pattern that followed her hit "Mambo!" and previous hits. He said that the album's laiko material contradicted the pop songs and made her overall sound less focused.
<ref name="iparhi logos mc review">{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccorner.gr/nees_kyklof/06/paparizou.html |title=Έλενα Παπαρίζου "Υπάρχει λόγος" |publisher=Musiccorner.gr |access-date=3 May 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Paparizou Fisika Mazi 3.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Paparizou performing on the Fisika Mazi tour on 30 June 2010 in Athens.]]

Paparizou's second English-language album ''The Game of Love'' was anticipated by Greek consumers and featured a similar sound to ''Iparhi Logos''; over half of the album's material was taken from the latter album. Zervas also reviewed this album, saying that it contained many different styles such as dance, hip hop, [[slow jams]] and [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]], following a typical recipe of American music. Zervas said that international female pop singers did not have much above Paparizou, and that the album's success would depend solely upon promotion efforts, although internationally affiliated record companies were less impressed. Zervas' impression was that while he believed in the material's potential, he thought that if Paparizou continued her current trends and performance style at laiko nightclubs, her ambitions for an international career would come to a disappointment.<ref name="musiccorner.gr">{{cite web|url=http://www.musiccorner.gr/nees_kyklof/index.html |title=Music Corner Νέες Κυκλοφορίες |publisher=Musiccorner.gr |access-date=3 May 2010}}</ref>

For ''Vrisko To Logo Na Zo'', her fourth album, Paparizou minimized the laiko influences and changed to a pop/rock sound and image in contrast to her previous albums. Evianna Nikoleri of Music Corner said that the album was carefully crafted and had a good, European-like production. For ''Giro Apo T' Oneiro'', Paparizou worked with the same group she had two years before, with small changes. She toned down the image she had created with her previous album; while many of the songs have rock influences and some songs include dance-pop and pop-folk, [[electronic music|electronic]] and [[lounge music]] elements, with an overall pop theme.<ref name="fifth album">{{cite web|url=http://www.sportime.gr/View.aspx?ArticleID=14829 |script-title=el:Νέα δισκογραφική δουλειά από την Έλενα!|date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Sportime |language=el |access-date=13 February 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref name="greek idol live 9">''[[Greek Idol]]''.

Paparizou has written two tracks on all of her studio albums except ''Iparhi Logos''; she also wrote the lyrics of the Antique song "Why?". These writing ventures were mostly collaborations with at least one other songwriter. She contributed lyrics to "Treli Kardia" (''Protereotita''), "Carpe Diem" and "Teardrops" (''The Game of Love''), and "Mathe Prota N'agapas" (''Vrisko To Logo Na Zo''), while she made her first musical contributions to ''Vrisko To Logo Na Zo'', "Den Tha 'Mai 'Do" and "Filarakia" (''Giro Apo T' Oneiro''){{mdash}}her first solo writing credit.<ref name="GATO">Paparizou, Elena.

Around 2013, Paparizou released her fifth Greek-language album titled ''Ti Ora Tha Vgoume?''. The music theme of this cd was similar to her previous with more pop, ballads and folk modern songs. Her next english album ''One Life'' followed pure pop sound while ''Ouranio Toxo'' in 2017 was a total bunch of mix kinds like pop,dance,ballads,folk and more containing in total 21 tracks.

===Vocal style===

===Fashion and style===
During her career with Antique, Paparizou had a simplistic look, representing a young girl; after going solo she made a transition into a more feminine and sexualized style.<ref name=chartshow /> Paparizou was known for wearing revealing clothes, which was a contrast from her "good girl" image.<ref name="vima bio"/> Her signature look was [[hot pants]], showcasing her legs as her most prominent physical feature.<ref name="star25">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssamGabFiNI|title=Helena Paparizou – No 16 on the E Entertainment Channel "Most Sexy Women" Exit Poll|date=26 October 2008|publisher=[[Star Channel (Greece)|Star Channel]]|language=el|access-date=23 February 2010|location=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> She also wore mini-dresses and five-inch high heels.<ref name="kafes1"/> To promote her album ''Vrisko To Logo Na Zo'', Paparizou adopted a rock-inspired image, appearing aggressive in dark tones of clothing and make-up.<ref name="marketakis">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wl9MYcwLXIs|title=Yiannis Marketakis – Super Star Interview 2008 (With Bonus)|date=17 November 2008|publisher=[[Star Channel (Greece)|Star Channel]]|language=el|access-date=23 February 2010|location=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The look was completed with multiple piercings, including her ears, tongue and most notably her nostril, on which she wore a wire chain connected to her ear piercing.

Evianna Nikoleri said that Paparizou was following the concurrent trend of pop/laiko female singers promoting a rock image{{mdash}}a trend she credited to Despina Vandi. Makis Kalamaris of Avopolis also said Paparizou's new image was for mainstream success rather than artistic expression, and added that Paparizou{{mdash}}knowing her limitations{{mdash}}was slowly easing into it rather than suddenly presenting a rock persona. Kalamaris also said that Paparizou was probably the only Greek female singer able to imitate the trends of international females without singing in [[skiladiko]] clubs and cloning herself into Madonna, which made her stand out against the concurrent mainstream scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avopolis.gr/greek/albums/default.asp?ID=4654 |title=Έλενα Παπαρίζου: Βρίσκω Το Λόγο Να Ζω |publisher=Avopolis.gr |year=2008 |access-date=3 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102201456/http://www.avopolis.gr/greek/albums/default.asp?ID=4654 |archive-date= 2 January 2009  }}</ref> Paparizou's make-up artist Giannis Marketakis stated that Paparizou always gives input to her look and fashion, and closely follows fashion trends.<ref name="marketakis" /> Paparizou said that she avoids extremes in her fashion choices.<ref name="CloseUp2010"/> In ''The Game of Love'', Paparizou gives credit to her stylist Al Giga for making her love fashion and herself, while she also acknowledges [[Roberto Cavalli]]{{mdash}}who has provided most of her wardrobe since Eurovision 2005{{mdash}}for his input.<ref name=tgol>Paparizou, Elena.

In 2011 Paparizou took a break from the Greek music scene and returned to Sweden alone.

Reportedly, he has requested half of their shared wealth and assets, which apart from their Glyfada home, included a second home in [[Chalkidiki]], property in Sweden, a [[Ferrari]] and joint bank accounts; their estate was valued at between {{€|6 million}} and {{€|7 million}}.
