== History ==

===Early history/formation (2006)===
The band was founded in 2006 by Jared "Dirty J" Watson and vocalist/guitarist Dustin "Duddy B" Bushnell in [[Orange County, California|Orange County, CA]], where there was reggae/[[ska]] influence. The two first met at a party during their first year of high school. Upon hearing one of Bushnell's rap demo tapes, Watson became inspired to collaborate with him on a new project. At the time Bushnell was already in a [[punk rock]] band, while Watson had no previous music experience.<ref>[http://musicremedy.com/d/Dirty_Heads/album/Any_Port_in_a_Storm-5686.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}</ref> In Bushnell's garage, the two began writing [[hip hop music|hip hop]] songs with [[reggae]] and [[punk rock|punk]] influences. Before filling their current lineup, Watson and Bushnell would perform with Bushnell's older brother Jake Bushnell's band, [[HB Surround Sound]].<ref>{{cite web |website=www.reddit.com |url=https://www.reddit.com/r/DirtyHeads/comments/cnqwzx/list_of_dirty_heads_bsides_demos_covers_solo_work/|title=List of Dirty Heads B-Sides, Demos, Covers, Solo work & Collaborations|date=August 8, 2019}}</ref> The band's name stems from their older brothers and family calling them "dirty heads" when they were younger.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

In 2007, the newly formed band recorded their first demo album titled, ''Dirty Demo'' that included 7 tracks with a song, "Gimmie The Mic", listed on the back cover as 'track number 77'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/release/15937168-Dirty-Heads-Dirty-Demo|title=Dirty Heads – Dirty Demo (2007, Demo, CD)|via=www.discogs.com}}</ref>

===''Any Port in a Storm'' (2008)===
Later, percussionist Jon Olazabal and bassist David Foral were added to the lineup. Record producer [[Rob Cavallo]], who was the chief creative officer at [[Warner Bros.]] signed the band to [[Warner Music Group]], but artistic differences led them to leave the label. The band managed to keep hold of their master recordings through the separation, which make up the bulk of ''Any Port in a Storm''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p902885/biography |title=Dirty Heads. Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=August 7, 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}</ref>

The band then connected with producers Steve Fox and [[Stan Frazier (musician)|Stan Frazier]] (drummer from [[Sugar Ray (band)|Sugar Ray]]) to complete their debut album. The album features appearances from [[The Beatles|Beatles]] collaborator [[Billy Preston]], Peruvian [[jazz]] percussionist [[Alex Acuna]], [[Grammy Award]]-nominated British [[reggae]] singer and DJ [[Tippa Irie]], and [[Indie 103.1]] reggae host Native Wayne. The song "[[Check the Level]]" includes guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and heavy metal vocalist [[M. Shadows]]. The album was mixed by [[Beastie Boys]] producer [[Mario C]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dirtyheads.com/fr_band.cfm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323112943/http://www.dirtyheads.com/fr_band.cfm |archive-date=March 23, 2010 |title=The Dirty Heads website |publisher=DirtyHeads.com |date=March 23, 2010 |access-date=August 7, 2012}}</ref> and [[Lewis Richards (musician)|Lewis Richards]] of 17th Street Recording. During the time period of making the album, drummer Matt Ochoa was not in the band and drummer of multiple known bands, including [[Sublime with Rome]] and [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Josh Freese]] stepped in to play drums.

The group first entered the rock/reggae scene when "Ring the Alarm" was chosen as a song on the first ''Pier Magazine'' Sampler.<ref>[http://thepier.org/ The Pier Magazine]. Thepier.org (August 16, 2011). Retrieved August 20, 2011.</ref>

The band started touring heavily in [[California]], [[Arizona]], and some parts of [[Mexico]] before becoming a national touring act. They maintain close ties with groups such as [[Sublime with Rome]].<ref>[http://www.musicemissions.com/blog/index.php/2011/04/20/music-emissions-interview-the-dirty-heads/ Music Emissions Interview with Jared Watson].

On March 9, 2012, the song "Spread Too Thin", from their album ''[[Cabin by the Sea]]'', premiered on L.A.'s [[KROQ]]. On the origins of the song, Watson commented, "In the music industry, there are ups-and-downs, and it's probably more emotionally stressful than physically. So I was talking to my dad, just about some stuff. I was a little stressed, and he has this funny saying. 'You're like a little bit of butter on too much bread.'"<ref name="radio1">{{cite web|url=http://kroq.radio.com/2012/03/09/the-dirty-heads-premiere-spread-too-thin-jared-aims-to-join-mile-high-club-while-listening/ |title=The Dirty Heads Premiere "Spread Too Thin," Jared Aims To Join Mile High Club While Listening " The World Famous KROQ – Alt Rock Music News, Photos, Videos, Concerts |publisher=Kroq.radio.com |date=March 9, 2012 |access-date=August 6, 2012}}</ref>

==Musical Influences==
In an interview, Nick Williams of [[The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment]] asked whether the Dirty Heads' reggae-rock vibe is influenced by [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]] and if they considered the band an Influence. Jared "Dirty J" Watson replied "I definitely do. We grew up listening to it. We came from the [Long Beach] area and knew a lot of the same people, but we're obviously much younger. We met [Sublime's] Eric [Wilson] and Brad [Nowell] a long time ago. Lewis Richards has produced our stuff. It's almost the same camp. But we are thinking forward. We're not trying to sound like a '90s band. We're still progressive in our music, even though we do have a vintage sound sometimes. [[The Black Keys]] inspire us to have warm sounds that have a lot of soul in it, but still be new and relevant."

==Other projects==
Starting in 2017, Dirty Heads collaborated with Four Sons Brewing, a mirco-brewing company in [[Huntington Beach, California]] to create a limited-edition "[[ale|Session Ale]]" in a specially designed container featuring album cover art. Named after the band's song "Vacation", this beer is brewed with real pineapple.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craftbeerkings.com/products/four-sons-dirty-heads-vacation|title=Four Sons / Dirty Heads - Vacation|website=CBK}}</ref>
