'''The Crabb Family''' is a [[southern gospel]] group originally from [[Beaver Dam, Kentucky]]. They have had sixteen No. 1 songs on the national radio charts.<ref name="crabbbio">[http://www.thecrabbfamily.com/biography.php The Crabb Family Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901225833/http://www.thecrabbfamily.com/biography.php |date=September 1, 2006 }}</ref>

==Group history==
The Crabb Family Members: oldest  [[Jason Crabb|Jason]], twin brothers Adam and [[Aaron & Amanda Crabb|Aaron]], and sisters Kelly and Terah.

The group was formed in Beaver Dam, a town in rural Kentucky. The family patriarch, [[Gerald Crabb]], and wife Kathy Crabb,<ref>[http://drjamesdobson.org/Broadcasts/Broadcast?i=9a66261f-c4fd-4871-9565-2ea996b7e7aa Kathy Crabb Hannah interview: Stronger] on Dr. James Dobson's Family Talk</ref> were the founders of the group. Kathy managed the group until their retirement in 2007. Throughout their career, the group has released numerous albums and received several awards.

Although their roots are primarily southern gospel, the Crabb Family's recording, ''Blur The Lines'' features a variety of styles of music. The Crabb Family also reached a vast concert audience. Their schedule lead them from the [[Grand Ole Opry]] to a contemporary Christian festival in [[South Dakota]] and everything in-between the two venues.

===Farewell===
In August 2006, the Crabb Family, Jason, Adam, Aaron, Terah and Kelly decided to follow individual paths. The siblings felt it was time to move to a new season in their lives. Each member plans to pursue their separate ministries. The Crabb Family has finished their tour to thank their fans for their unwavering support over the past ten years. Their last tour date as a group was August 1, 2007.<ref>[http://thecrabbfamily.com/news.php Crabb Family Says Farewell] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060720135742/http://thecrabbfamily.com/news.php |date=July 20, 2006 }}</ref>

After that, [[Jason Crabb]] has started his own solo career. His brother Aaron started a duo with his wife Amanda called simply [[Aaron & Amanda Crabb]], while Adam and Terah started a band called [[Crabb Revival]]. In 2009, Terah decided to leave the band to become a full-time mother.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026034243/http://www.crabbrevival.net/news.php Terah Crabb Penhollow: Putting Family First] on CrabbRevival.net</ref> Kelly Bowling has also joined her husband, Mike, in a musical career as a member of [[The Bowling Family]] (formerly ''The Mike Bowling Group'').  In 2011, in addition to performing with his wife, Aaron Crabb became a founding member of the quartet [[Canton Junction (singing group)|Canton Junction]], in which he sings lead.  In 2014, Adam Crabb  joined the [[Gaither Vocal Band]].

The Crabb Family reunited for a Celebration Tour in November 2011 through February 2012, as well as a new album, ''Together Again'', released February 7, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Evans|first=Scott|title=Crabb Family To Reunite For Project And Tour|url=http://www.sgmusicforum.com/content/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1211:crabb-family-to-reunite-for-project-and-tour&catid=1:latest-news&Itemid=50|accessdate=5 January 2012}}</ref>

The Crabb Family reunited for a sold out tour in early 2015, as they celebrated 20 years in Christian music.
