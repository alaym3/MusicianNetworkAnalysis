'''Thomas Hübner''' (born 9 April 1980), better known by his stage name '''Clueso''' ({{IPA-de|klyˈzo|pron}}), is a German singer, rapper, songwriter, and producer. His first album, ''Text und Ton'', was released in 2001. Since then, he has released seven more albums, of which the last three—''Stadtrandlichter'' (2014), ''Neuanfang'' (2016) and ''Handgepäck I'' (2018)—reached number 1 of the [[GfK Entertainment charts|German Top 100]].

His music is notable for being a mix of [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], pop and [[electronic music]], and sometimes [[reggae]].

== Career ==
Born in [[Erfurt]], Clueso—named after Inspector Clouseau in ''[[The Pink Panther (film series)|The Pink Panther]]''—started making music in 1995. In 1998, he got to know his future manager Andreas Welskop and gave up his hairdressing apprenticeship. His first vinyl, ''Clüsolo'', was released on BMG Ufa the same year. In 1999, he moved to the 10vor10-Studios in [[Cologne]] with Welskop. A year later, he signed a label contract at [[Four Music]] and released ''Text und Ton'' in 2001. Around that time, he performed with Curfew at the ''MTV HipHop Open'' in [[Stuttgart]] and at ''Beats for Life'' in Cologne.

In 2002, Clueso moved back to Erfurt and recorded the ''Rowdy-Club-Tape 2002''. One year later, he started producing his second album ''Gute Musik,'' which translates to "Good Music" (featuring [[Blumentopf]], Steer M, Tilmann Jarmer, Delhia, Tim Neuhaus and Jürgen Kerth), which was finished by 2004. It does not contain any English tracks and concentrates on singing rather than rapping.

In 2005, Clueso represented [[Thuringia]] in the [[Bundesvision Song Contest 2005]] with the song "Kein Bock zu gehen", placing seventh with 63 points.<ref name="fan-lexikon">{{cite web|url=http://www.fan-lexikon.de/film-tv/bundesvision-song-contest/|title=Bundesvision Song Contest|work=fan-lexikon.de|language=German|accessdate=19 April 2015}}</ref> The same year, he was the partner of Start Ab, the "biggest non-commercial remix contest in Europe".

On 19 May 2006, his third album, ''Weit weg'', was released. In conjunction with the ''STÜBAphilharmonie'', a Thuringian orchestra, Clueso gave a concert in the Fritz-Club in Berlin on 3 February 2007, where he performed his songs together with the orchestra and his band in an arrangement for more than 70 instruments. This concert was also released on the DVD ''Clueso Live'' or ''Clueso – Weit weg – Live''. In May and June 2007, Clueso was the opening act of [[Herbert Grönemeyer]]'s ''12-Tour'' and in the same year he was nominated by 1 live for the 1 live radio listener's award, the 1LIVE Krone, in the category "Best Live Act".

In September 2007, the single "Lala", a song, which was especially recorded for the movie ''[[Leroy (film)|Leroy]]'', was released. On 14 February 2008, Clueso again represented Thuringia in [[Stefan Raab]]'s [[Bundesvision Song Contest]]. With his song "Keinen Zentimeter", he came second, only one point behind the winner. On 30 May 2008, his fourth album ''So sehr dabei'' was released.

In December 2010 Clueso released a book ''Clueso. Von und über'' ("Clueso. Made By and About").<ref>Schwarzkopf & Schwarzkopf, Berlin 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-89602-578-4}}, 160 p.</ref>

The fifth studio album ''An und für sich'' ("In and of itself") was released on 25 March 2011. The same year, Clueso collaborated with [[Udo Lindenberg]] performing the song "Cello" on the album ''[[MTV Unplugged]] – Live im Hotel Atlantic.'' The song was also released as a single and reached number 4 in the [[GfK Entertainment charts|German charts]]. 
After having released number 1 album ''Stadtrandlichter'' in 2014, Clueso parted ways with his long-standing band and management team. He wrote his following album about this period of separation and fittingly named it ''Neuanfang''"("New Beginning").<ref>https://www.faz.net/aktuell/feuilleton/pop/album-der-woche/clueso-veroeffentlicht-neues-album-neuanfang-14500066.html<nowiki/>27 October 2016</ref> The album reached number 1 of the German charts. 

After the release of ''Neuanfang'', he started working on a new album called ''Handgepäck I'' ("Hand Luggage I"), a collection of acoustic songs that he has written and collected over the last seven years during several trips and journeys around the world.<ref>https://www.offiziellecharts.de/news/item/544-clueso-packt-die-charts-krone-ins-handgepaeck 31 August 2018</ref>
