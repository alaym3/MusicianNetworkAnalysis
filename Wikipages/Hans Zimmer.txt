==Early life==
Zimmer was born in [[Frankfurt]], [[West Germany]]. As a young child, he lived in [[Königstein im Taunus|Königstein-Falkenstein]], where he played the piano at home but had piano lessons only briefly, as he disliked the discipline of formal lessons.<ref name="mtv.de">{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.de/music/20224928/bio-Hans%20Zimmer.html | title=MTV biography – Hans Zimmer (in German) | access-date=27 September 2011 | archive-date=11 February 2013 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20130211144922/http://www.mtv.de/music/20224928/bio-Hans%20Zimmer.html | url-status=dead}}</ref> In one of his [[R/IAmA|Reddit AMAs]], he said: "My formal training was two weeks of piano lessons.

In an interview with the [[BBC]], Zimmer said: "''Going for Gold'' was a lot of fun. It's the sort of stuff you do when you don't have a career yet.

A year after ''Rain Man'', Zimmer was asked to compose the score for [[Bruce Beresford]]'s ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' which, like ''Rain Man'', won an [[Academy Award]] for Best Picture. ''Driving Miss Daisy'''s instrumentation consisted entirely of synthesizers and [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], played by Zimmer. According to an interview with ''[[Sound on Sound]]'' magazine in 2002, the piano sounds heard within the score come from the [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] MKS–20, a rackmount synthesizer.

Zimmer wrote the theme for [[Tony Scott]]'s 1993 film ''[[True Romance]]'', which he based on [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Gassenhauer]]''.

For the 1992 film ''[[The Power of One (film)|The Power of One]]'', Zimmer traveled to Africa in order to use African choirs and drums in the recording of the score. On the strength of this work, [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Walt Disney Feature Animation]] approached Zimmer to compose the score for the 1994 film ''[[The Lion King]]''. This was to be his first score for an animated film. Zimmer said that he had wanted to go to South Africa to record parts of the soundtrack, but was unable to visit the country as he had a police record there "for doing 'subversive' movies" after his work on ''The Power of One''. Disney studio bosses expressed fears that Zimmer would be killed if he went to South Africa, so the recording of the choirs was organized during a visit by [[Lebo M]].<ref name="lion">{{cite news

}}

Zimmer's score for [[Tony Scott]]'s 1995 film ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'' won a Grammy Award for the main theme, which makes heavy use of synthesizers in place of traditional orchestral instruments. For ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' (1998), Zimmer said that the director [[Terrence Malick]] wanted the music before he started filming, so he recorded six and a half hours of music.<ref name="ew.com"/> Zimmer's next project was ''[[The Prince of Egypt]]'' (1998), which was produced by [[DreamWorks Animation]]. He introduced [[Ofra Haza]], an Israeli Yemenite singer, to the directors, and they thought she was so beautiful that they designed one of the characters in the film to look like her.<ref name="ew.com"/>

Zimmer's [[The Thin Red Line (soundtrack)|score]] for the 1998 film ''[[The Thin Red Line (1998 film)|The Thin Red Line]]'' is regarded as one of his most important works.

<blockquote>Originally I had this idea that it should be possible to create some kind of community around this kind of work, and I think by muddying the titles – not having "you are the composer, you are the arranger, you are the orchestrator" – it just sort of helped us to work more collaboratively. It wasn't that important to me that I had "score by Hans Zimmer" and took sole credit on these things. It's like ''Gladiator'': I gave [[Lisa Gerrard]] the co-credit because, even though she didn't write the main theme, her presence and contributions were very influential. She was more than just a soloist, and this is why I have such a problem with specific credits.<ref name="gerrard">{{cite web
