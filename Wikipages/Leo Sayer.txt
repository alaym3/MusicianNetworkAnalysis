==Early life==
Sayer was born to an Irish mother, Theresa Nolan, and an English father, Thomas E. G. Sayer, in [[Shoreham-by-Sea]], Sussex, where he attended St Peter's Catholic Primary School. He was the second of three brothers: Michael was born in 1939 and Brian in 1951. He later attended Blessed Robert Southwell (now St Oscar Romero catholic school) in [[Goring-by-Sea]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.teachsecondary.com/comment/view/what-i-learnt-at-school-leo-sayer|title=What I learnt at school: Leo Sayer|website=Teachsecondary.com|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref> before studying commercial art and graphic design at West Sussex College of Art and Design in [[Worthing]], Sussex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leosayer.com/biography/leos-story-so-far|title=Leo's Story – So Far…|website=Leo Sayer.com|date=21 May 1948|access-date=16 April 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150310161951/http://www.leosayer.com/biography/leos-story-so-far|archive-date=10 March 2015}}</ref> 

He was initially discovered by musician [[David Courtney]], who then co-managed and co-produced him with former pop singer turned manager, [[Adam Faith]].<ref name="500 Number One Hits">Rice, Jo. ''The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits'' (1st edition), Guinness Superlatives Ltd, Middlesex, UK, p. 181; {{ISBN|0-85112-250-7}}</ref> In January 1967, while 18-year-old Sayer was working as a hall porter at the King's Hotel in [[Hove]], he assisted in the rescue of elderly guests from a serious fire that damaged the hotel's first floor. He himself was rescued from the blazing hotel by builders working on a block of flats beside the hotel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mybrightonandhove.org.uk/page_id__5348_path__0p115p193p829p.aspx|title=Bedford Hotel, King's Road: Fire at the hotel|website=Mybrightonandhove.org|access-date=16 September 2013}}</ref>

==Career==
Sayer began his music career co-writing songs with David Courtney, including "[[Giving It All Away]]", which gave [[Roger Daltrey]] of [[the Who]] his first solo hit in 1973.<ref name="500 Number One Hits"/> The same year, Sayer began his career as a recording artist under the management of [[Adam Faith]], who signed Sayer to the [[Chrysalis Music|Chrysalis]] label in the United Kingdom and [[Warner Bros. Records]] in the United States.

His debut single, "Why Is Everybody Going Home", failed to chart, but he achieved national prominence in the United Kingdom with his second single, the [[music hall]] styled song "[[The Show Must Go On (Leo Sayer song)|The Show Must Go On]]", which Sayer performed on British television wearing a [[pierrot]] costume and makeup. The single went to No. 2 on the United Kingdom singles chart,<ref name="500 Number One Hits"/> as did his debut album, ''Silverbird'', co-written with David Courtney who also co-produced the album with Adam Faith. [[Three Dog Night]]'s cover, the group's last Billboard Hot 100 top 10 record, reached No. 4 on 25 May 1974.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Chart History - 3 Dog Night |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/three-dog-night/chart-history |website=Billboard |publisher=MRC Media and Info |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref>

His subsequent singles were all major hits in the United Kingdom{{spnd}}"One Man Band" went to No. 6 in 1974, "Long Tall Glasses" (UK No. 4, 1974) became his first Top Ten hit in the United States, reaching No. 9,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Chart History - Leo Sayer |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/leo-sayer/chart-history |website=Billboard |publisher=MRC Media and Info |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref> and "Moonlighting" went to No. 2 in the United Kingdom in 1975. In 1976, Sayer recorded three [[Beatles]] songs, "[[I Am the Walrus]]", "[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]]" and "[[The Long and Winding Road]]", for the Beatles-themed concept film ''[[All This and World War II]]''. His albums in this period were also consistently successful in the United Kingdom: he scored five consecutive Top 10 placings on the United Kingdom album chart between 1973 and 1977.

He also garnered success as an album artist in the United States, beginning with his second LP ''Just A Boy'' (1974), which reached No. 16. His fourth album ''Endless Flight'' (1976) consolidated his international popularity, reaching No. 4 in the United Kingdom and No. 10 in the United States; it also charted strongly in other countries including Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, and New Zealand, and was certified as a platinum album in both the United Kingdom and the United States,<ref name=RIAA/> and double-platinum in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Music Canada - Gold/Platinum |url=https://musiccanada.com/gold-platinum/?_gp_search=Leo%20Sayer |website=Music Canada |publisher=Music Canada |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref>

The peak of his career came in 1977, when he achieved two consecutive number one hits in the United States, first with the disco-styled "[[You Make Me Feel Like Dancing]]" (a [[Grammy Award]] winner for the year's [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|best Rhythm and Blues Song]]),<ref>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Artist - Leo Sayer |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/leo-sayer/12444 |website=Grammy |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref> followed by a romantic ballad, "[[When I Need You]]" (1977), which reached number one in both the United Kingdom and United States. Written by [[Albert Hammond]] and [[Carole Bayer Sager]], it was Sayer's first No. 1 single in the United Kingdom (after three number two hits).<ref name="British Hit Singles">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2001|title=British Hit Singles|edition=14th|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|location=London|page=46|isbn=0-85156-156-X}}</ref> It was also the first of two chart-toppers in a row in the United Kingdom for producer [[Richard Perry]].<ref name="British Hit Singles"/> Also from ''Endless Flight'', Sayer covered the [[Danny O'Keefe]] song "Magdalena", which served as the B-side to the "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" single version.

In 1979, the compilation album ''The Very Best of Leo Sayer'' (originally released by Chrysalis in the UK and elsewhere, with its first release in the US in 2000 by Rhino Records with different cover art) became Sayer's first United Kingdom No. 1 LP and his seventh consecutive United Kingdom Top 20 album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Leo Sayer - The Very Best of Leo Sayer |url=https://www.discogs.com/Leo-Sayer-The-Very-Best-Of-Leo-Sayer/master/112489 |website=Discogs |publisher=Discogs |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Erlewine |first1=Thomas |title=Leo Sayer - The Very Best of Leo Sayer (Rhino) |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-very-best-of-leo-sayer-rhino-mw0000052376 |website=AllMusic |publisher=AllMusic/Netaktion LLC |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref> Sayer also guest-starred in the second episode of the third season of ''[[The Muppet Show]]'', and performed "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing", "The Show Must Go On", and "When I Need You".<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj0AuBz-xfs| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414002836/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pj0AuBz-xfs| archive-date=2017-04-14 | url-status=dead|title="The Show Must Go On" ~ Leo Sayer ~ Muppet Show|date=26 March 2014|publisher=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zNbQo2_oNM|title="WHEN I NEED YOU" ~ Leo Sayer ~ Muppet Show|date=19 February 2014|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

In the United States, three of his singles{{spnd}}"You Make Me Feel Like Dancing" (1977), "When I Need You" (1977) and "More Than I Can Say" (1980){{spnd}}were certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]].<ref name=RIAA>{{cite web |last1=Staff |title=Leo Sayer |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=Leo+Sayer#search_section |website=RIAA |publisher=RIAA |access-date=22 August 2020}}</ref>

Sayer provided songs for the soundtrack of the French–Belgian animated film ''[[The Missing Link (1980 film)|The Missing Link]]'' (''Le Chainon manquant'') in 1980. In 1981, he voiced Dan the [[forest ranger]] in ''[[The Raccoons on Ice]]'', the second of four specials serving as a predecessor to the Canadian animated series ''[[The Raccoons]]''. He also sang several songs for the special, all of which were included on the 1983 album ''[[Lake Freeze - The Raccoons Songtrack|Lake Freeze]]'' and the 1984 album ''[[The Raccoons: Let's Dance!#Album|The Raccoons: Let's Dance!]]''. 

In 1990, he contributed to the last studio collaboration between [[Alan Parsons]] and [[Eric Woolfson]], Woolfson's solo album ''[[Freudiana]]'', performing "I Am A Mirror".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ericwoolfsonmusic.com/Freudiana/index.html|title=Eric Woolfson's FREUDIANA&nbsp;— The Musical|website=Ericwoolfsonmusic.com|access-date=29 May 2008}}</ref> Sayer performed at the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] in 1990, with "The Moth And The Flame" (English version of "Tu... sì" by [[Pino Mango|Mango]]) and, in 1991, with "All Alone" (English version of "Dubbi No" by [[Mietta]]).

===Financial difficulties===
After a decade of success, Sayer's career suffered repeated setbacks due to a series of financial and legal problems. When Sayer and his first wife Janice divorced in 1985, subsequent financial disclosure revealed Adam Faith had badly mishandled his business affairs and that much of the millions of pounds he had earned over the previous decade had been lost through Faith's questionable investments and business expenses.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

Sayer sued Faith for mismanagement; and the case was eventually settled out of court in 1992, with Sayer receiving a reported payout of £650,000. In the early 1990s, his career stalled again while he fought a protracted but ultimately successful legal battle against his former label, Chrysalis, to regain the publishing rights to his songs.

In 1996, Sayer sued his new management, after he discovered that his pension fund had allegedly been mismanaged to around £1&nbsp;million. Despite spending more than £90,000 in legal fees the case never made it to court and Sayer abandoned the suit for reasons of cost. He assembled a band led by former [[Van Morrison]] guitarist Ronnie Johnson and toured his way back to financial security. They recorded a live album, ''Live in London'', which was released in 1999.<ref>{{cite news|author=Mark Anstead|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2004/nov/20/features.jobsmoney2|title=Fame and fortune: Singer who lost control of his notes|work=The Guardian|date=20 November 2004|access-date=16 April 2015}}</ref>

===Later career===
On 12 February 2006, he made a return to number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with DJ [[Meck (musician)|Meck]]'s remix of "[[Thunder in My Heart (song)|Thunder In My Heart]]". It was his first appearance in the United Kingdom Top 10 for almost twenty-four years, and his second chart-topper in the United Kingdom, almost three decades after his first.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} ''Leo Sayer: At His Very Best'', a career spanning [[compilation album]], was released in the United Kingdom on 6 March 2006. It featured the Meck single, alongside "When I Need You" and "You Make Me Feel Like Dancing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/at-his-very-best-mw0000404072|title=At His Very Best&nbsp;– Leo Sayer&nbsp;– Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=3 October 2014}}</ref>
