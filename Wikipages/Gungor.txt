'''Gungor''' was a musical collective formed by husband and wife duo [[Michael Gungor]] and Lisa Gungor. The group's music has been compared to the music of [[Sufjan Stevens]], Bon Iver and Arcade Fire.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Song debut: Gungor's 'I Am Mountain'|website = [[USA Today]]|url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/08/16/gungor-i-am-mountain-song-debut/2665241/|accessdate = August 26, 2015}}</ref>

The band has released seven studio albums,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/2628713-Gungor|title=Gungor|website=[[Discogs]]}}</ref> the last one appearing in March 2019. These albums explored a broad musical soundscape and charted the couple's changing beliefs from traditional Christianity through a more [[panentheistic]] worldview, other religions, and [[apophatic theology]].<ref name="Long Way Off lyrics">{{Cite web |url=https://genius.com/Gungor-long-way-off-lyrics |title=Long Way Off lyrics |access-date=May 29, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Tweet on apophatic theology">{{Cite tweet |number=382949123399229440 |user=michaelgungor |title=Apophatic mystic...has come to terms with and actually deeply experiences and appreciates Mystery |author=Michael Gungor |date=September 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Tweet on Michael Gungor's beliefs">{{Cite tweet |number=941505762248888320 |user=michaelgungor |title=How’s this:  Apophatic mystic Hindu pantheist Christian Buddhist skeptic with a penchant for nihilistic progressive existentialism  |author=Michael Gungor |date=December 14, 2017}}</ref> In early 2018, they announced a shift in direction that would see Gungor return to the progressive spiritual space, while the less mainstream material will move to "other projects" including Michael and Lisa’s solo projects.<ref name="Facebook post, April 26, 2018">{{Cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/gungormusic/posts/10160305686320162 |title=Gungor - Publications |website=Facebook |access-date=May 29, 2018}}</ref>

== History ==

Michael Gungor grew up in [[Marshfield, Wisconsin]]. He is the son of pastor and author Ed Gungor. He began writing and playing music at a young age and went on to study jazz guitar at both [[Western Michigan University]] and the [[University of North Texas]] while also touring and working as a multi-instrumentalist musician.

Lisa Gungor grew up in [[Deming, New Mexico]].<ref name="last.fm">{{Cite web|title = Lisa Gungor's Biography – Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and pictures at Last.fm|url = http://www.last.fm/music/Lisa+Gungor/+wiki|website = last.fm|accessdate = August 26, 2015}}</ref> She came from a "sports-crazed" family and didn't fully commit to her musical abilities until her senior year in high school.<ref name="last.fm"/>

Michael and Lisa met at [[Oral Roberts University]] during their first year.

Michael renamed the group from The Michael Gungor Band to simply Gungor in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}} The first album release under the new name was ''Beautiful Things'' in 2010 that features a short gospel-blues jam featuring [[Israel Houghton]] titled "Heaven". In 2011, the album and its title track, "Beautiful Things", were nominated for the Grammy categories Best Rock or Rap Gospel Album and Best Gospel Song, respectively.

In 2011, Gungor released ''Ghosts Upon the Earth''. Gungor followed up with a live album, ''A Creation Liturgy'' in 2012. The band's third studio album, ''I Am Mountain'', was released on September 24, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last = Irvine|first = Nate|url = http://metroyouthnetwork.com/2013/08/22/gungors-long-awaited-new-release-i-am-mountain/|title = Gungor's Long Awaited New Release: I Am Mountain &#124; Connect.

Though Gungor's music is filled with Christian themes, the collective has attempted to distance itself from being labeled simply a "Christian" band due to the problematic way the term is often used.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gungormusic.com/#!/2011/11/zombies-wine-and-christian-music/|title=Gungor|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.faithvillage.com/article/c6e41a44b9e245c3a35967f0bcb02953/gungor_talks_with_faithvillage|title = Gungor Talks With FaithVillage - FaithVillage &#124; MOVE YOUR FAITH HERE|publisher = FaithVillage|date = May 14, 2012|accessdate = January 21, 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://archive.is/20131008185111/http://www.faithvillage.com/article/c6e41a44b9e245c3a35967f0bcb02953/gungor_talks_with_faithvillage|archivedate = October 8, 2013|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Michael refers to Gungor as a collective because at any given time the group is composed of 3-10 members.

In 2015, Gungor embarked on their most ambitious creative project thus far: ''One Wild Life.'' The band released three full-length albums—''Soul'', ''Spirit'' and ''Body''—in a span of 12 months. ''[[One Wild Life: Soul]]'' kicked off the trilogy on August 7, 2015. While each record carries a distinct vibe, the album series presents a body of work that celebrates the adventure and challenges faced by Michael and Lisa Gungor since the release of their previous album "I Am Mountain".<ref>{{Citation|title = One Wild Life Soul|url = http://www.gungormusic.com/onewildlife/|accessdate = August 26, 2015}}</ref> ''[[One Wild Life: Soul]]'' charted on multiple ''Billboard'' charts the first week of release, including [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303246/Gungor/chart?f=305|title=Gungor - Chart history - Billboard|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303246/Gungor/chart?f=794|title=Gungor - Chart history - Billboard|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303246/Gungor/chart?f=310|title=Gungor - Chart history - Billboard|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303246/Gungor/chart?f=326|title=Gungor - Chart history - Billboard|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/303246/Gungor/chart?f=408|title=Gungor - Chart history - Billboard|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=|accessdate=July 16, 2016}}</ref> On ''One Wild Life: Soul,'' Michael and Lisa wrote a song dedicated to Lucie,<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_uioQqW8ac|title=Light - Gungor [OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO]|date=July 14, 2015|work=YouTube|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}</ref> their second daughter, who was diagnosed with Down Syndrome.<ref>{{cite web|title = Gungor Music Blog|url = http://gungormusic.com/2014/05/lucette/|website = Gungormusic.com|accessdate = November 9, 2014|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141110002302/http://gungormusic.com/2014/05/lucette/|archivedate = November 10, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

On April 26, 2018, Gungor announced on the band's official Facebook page that they were going to address the "multiple personality thing going on within its musical stylings" by bringing Gungor back to its roots in "the progressive spiritual space, and finding different homes for some of the other music that we’ve tried unsuccessfully to fundamentally change the Gungor brand with". This was accompanied by the removal of ''I Am Mountain'' and ''One Wild Life'' series from online stores and streaming services, the latter being replaced by a 90-minute "director's cut" of the three albums. Michael and Lisa also announced an upcoming solo album each in the post.<ref name="Facebook post, April 26, 2018"/>

On February 1, 2019, the band announced that their upcoming "End of the World" Tour would be "Gungor's farewell tour". While Michael and Lisa would continue to make music, future projects would no longer be recorded under the Gungor band name.<ref name="The End, Blog Post, 20 Feb 2019">{{cite web |last1=Gungor |first1=Michael |title=The End |url=http://www.gungormusic.com/blog/2019/1/the-end |website=Gungor |accessdate=February 20, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gungor Is Ending: 'It's Time For Something New' |url=https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/gungor-is-ending-its-time-for-something-new/ |website=RELEVANT Magazine |accessdate=February 20, 2019 |date=February 1, 2019}}</ref>

On March 1, 2019, the band released ''Archives'', an album intended to wind down the project. ''Archives'' is composed of previously unreleased material as well as re-released material.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BueKv1VDYas/|title=Gungor on Instagram: "NEW ALBUM out now!
