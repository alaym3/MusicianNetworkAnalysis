'''Vicious Rumors''' are an American [[power metal]] band, originally formed in 1979 in the [[San Francisco]], [[California]] Bay Area. The band was conceived by founder and guitarist/vocalist Geoff Thorpe, and has been actively recording and touring worldwide since their full-length recording debut in 1985.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/ViRu|title=The BNR Metal Pages - Band|website=Bnrmetal.com|access-date=November 14, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141025051705/http://www.bnrmetal.com/v3/band/band/ViRu|archive-date=October 25, 2014}}</ref> The band is signed to the Germany-based label [[SPV GmbH|SPV/Steamhammer]].

==Biography==

=== Foundation and full-length debut ''Soldiers of the Night'' (1979–1986) ===
Guitarist and composer Thorpe began his musical career as a teenager in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. Thorpe had set out to start forming the band in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] during the summer of 1979.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.deanguitars.com/geoff_thorpe.php | title = The Dean Artists: Geoff Thorpe of Vicious Rumors | access-date = August 14, 2013 | publisher = [[Dean Guitars]]}}</ref> Other Bay Area-based bands like [[Exodus (band)|Exodus]], [[Anvil Chorus]], [[Metallica]](Metallica was originally from L.A, but may be considered by many to be a Bay Area band - they moved to the Bay to play with Cliff Burton), and [[Death Angel]] were also starting out during that era. These bands were playing the same local venues and establishing the [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene—which in a few years would become very popular worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/default,29.sm |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 17, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402155158/http://www.rockdetector.com/default,29.sm |archive-date=April 2, 2007 }}</ref>

While working towards a stable lineup, early incarnations of Vicious Rumors played live extensively within California's Bay Area between 1980 and 1985. Their first studio recordings appeared on compilations such as [[KMEL]]'s ''New Oasis'' and ''U.S. Metal'' vol. III and IV in 1982, 1983 and 1984. These recordings helped the band obtain their first record deal with the legendary [[Shrapnel Records]].<ref name=website>{{cite web|url=http://www.viciousrumors.com|title=On the Edge - The Official Vicious Rumors Homepage|website=Viciousrumors.com|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

The band's first full-length album ''[[Soldiers of the Night]]'' was released in 1985, it featured Geoff Thorpe, Gary St. Pierre, Vinnie Moore, Dave Starr, and Larry Howe. It quickly began to establish VR's worldwide reputation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Vicious_Rumors/Soldiers_of_the_Night/4228/|title=Vicious Rumors - Soldiers of the Night - Reviews - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> This release is classed as a milestone and a classic in [[power metal]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/viciousrumors.htm |title=No Life 'til Metal - CD Gallery - Vicious Rumors |website=Nolifetilmetal.com |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref> The lineup at that time included a young guitarist named [[Vinnie Moore]]. (Vinnie originally lived in Delaware, but was recommended to the band by Shrapnel Records founder [[Mike Varney]]).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.vinniemoore.com/discography/vicious.html | title = Soldiers of the Night | access-date = August 14, 2013 | last = Moore | first = Vinnie | author-link = Vinnie Moore | publisher = Vinnie Moore Official Website | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120306131013/http://www.vinniemoore.com/discography/vicious.html | archive-date = March 6, 2012 }}</ref>

=== The classic Vicious Rumors: from ''Digital Dictator'' to ''Word of Mouth'' (1987–1994) ===
Late 1986 saw bassist Dave Starr bring in vocalist [[Carl Albert (musician)|Carl Albert]] (Villain, Ruffians) and guitarist Mark McGee (Overdrive, Starcastle, and later with [[Gregg Allman]]) to replace St. Pierre and Moore respectively—prior to the recording of the band's second album, ''[[Digital Dictator]]''. This release with Shrapnel Records helped define Vicious Rumors' classic US power metal sound.<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/vicious-rumors-mn0000199163/biography|title=Vicious Rumors - Biography - AllMusic|author=Vincent Jeffries|work=AllMusic|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> ''Digital Dictator'' was the year's No. 1 album in one of Europe's top metal magazines, RockHard. The album sold well in Japan, the US, and the rest of Europe.<ref name=website/> Vicious Rumors became an international live act at this point: they were invited to appear at the Dutch Aardschok Festival (alongside Megadeth, Testament, and Nuclear Assault), the [[Dynamo Open Air]] Festival (where they played in front of 40,000 people), and at live festivals with [[Death Angel]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]].

An increase in popularity began to generate interest in the band from major record labels, and in 1989 they signed a deal with the legendary major label [[Atlantic Records]](Led Zeppelin, AC/DC,...). Their first Atlantic release was the self-titled ''[[Vicious Rumors (Vicious Rumors album)|Vicious Rumors]]'' in 1990. The band subsequently began their first full US tour—which lasted for over three months<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.markmcgee.com/discography.html|title=Mark McGee - Discography|website=Markmcgee.com|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> and shot their first official video, "Don't Wait for Me", directed by [[Gore Verbinski]]. This tour was quickly placed in rotation on MTV's ''[[Headbangers Ball]]''.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

1991 saw the release of Vicious Rumors' fourth album, ''[[Welcome to the Ball]]''. This recording received [[Bay Area Music Awards]] nominations for "Best New Metal Album" and "Outstanding Metal Album" (other nominees included Metallica and [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://alamedaallstars.com/mcgee.html | title = The Alameda All Stars Mark McGee | access-date = August 14, 2013 | publisher = Alameda All Stars Official Website}}</ref>). Their second MTV video, "Children", went beyond the exposure normally limited to metal bands on ''Headbangers Ball''. It received regular daytime air play. The band finished the year with a one-month European tour—with [[Savatage]]—and four months worth of live US performance dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/band.php?band_id=2187|title=Vicious Rumors - Metal Storm|website=Metalstorm.net|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

After a 1992 tour with label-mates Savatage<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/santa+rosa/vicious+rumors | title = Vicious Rumors | access-date = August 15, 2013 | last = Sharpe-Young | first = Garry | year = 2009 | publisher = [[MusicMight]] | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101127024912/http://musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/santa+rosa/vicious+rumors | archive-date = November 27, 2010 | url-status = dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.realsavatage.com/articles/reviews/rev.MHDE_12.91.shtml | title = Savatage - Vicious Rumors | access-date = August 15, 2013 | last = Schowe | first = Andreas | date = October 25, 1991 | publisher = Real Savatage.com}}</ref> and the release of the [[live album]] ''[[Plug In and Hang On: Live in Tokyo]]'', guitarist Thorpe was diagnosed with [[carpal tunnel syndrome]]. He was forced to undergo surgery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therocktemple.nl/en/component/content/article/37-nieuwe-concerten/221-vicious-rumors-a-support|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120306131206/http://www.therocktemple.nl/en/component/content/article/37-nieuwe-concerten/221-vicious-rumors-a-support|url-status=dead|title=LILLIAN AXE + SUPPORT|date=March 6, 2012|archive-date=March 6, 2012|website=Archive.is|access-date=December 14, 2017}}</ref> During the year-long hiatus for Vicious Rumors, the band parted company with both Atlantic Records and bassist Dave Starr.<ref name=website/>

After Thorpe recovered, new bass player Tommy Sisco (ex-Villain with Carl Albert) was recruited. The band's sixth album, 1994's ''[[Word of Mouth (Vicious Rumors album)|Word of Mouth]]'', was recorded and released on the Rising Sun label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhard.de/megazine/reviewarchiv/review-anzeigen/11270-word-of-mouth.html|title=RockHard: Review anzeigen|website=Rockhard.de|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> The CD included the song "Thunder and Rain" (parts 1 and 2), which was dedicated to the memory of [[Criss Oliva]] of Savatage.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.realsavatage.com/criss/memories/vrmem2.shtml | title = Vicious Rumors Remembers Criss Oliva | access-date = August 15, 2013 | date = September 1999 | publisher = Real Savatage.com}}</ref>

Sales of "Word of Mouth" were strong, the reception was positive, and the band resumed touring to support the release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.viciousrumors.com/history2.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 25, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822212628/http://www.viciousrumors.com/history2.html |archive-date=August 22, 2014 }}</ref> Vicious Rumors were now becoming increasingly popular in Europe; they were invited back to the Dynamo Open Air Festival in the Netherlands. They also joined forces with [[Accept (band)|Accept]] for several summer festival dates.<ref name=website/> The band returned to Europe later that year for more live shows, this time with [[Metal Church]], [[Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction]], and [[Paul Di'Anno]]'s Killers.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

=== Death of Carl Albert and subsequent releases (1995–2001) ===
After returning from the European Ultimate-Power-Force-Tour with Metal Church and Paul Di'Anno's Killers, singer Carl Albert was killed in a California Bay Area car accident on April 22, 1995.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://themusicsover.com/2010/04/22/carl-albert/ | title = Died On This Date (April 22, 1995) Carl Albert / Vicious Rumors | access-date = August 15, 2013 | date = April 22, 2010 | publisher = The Music's Over.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Carl_Albert/13078 | title = Carl Albert | access-date = August 15, 2013 | publisher = [[Encyclopaedia Metallum]]}}</ref> Around the same time, Mark McGee left the band. [[Steve Smyth]] (future member of [[Nevermore]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]]) was recruited as his replacement.<ref name=website/>

Upon Albert's death, the band released ''[[A Tribute to Carl Albert]]'' (culled from non-soundboard recordings taken from the ''Word of Mouth'' European tour), and their first home video ''[[The First Ten Years (VHS)|The First Ten Years]]<ref name=website/>''. Additionally Mark McGee composed and recorded the song "Find Your Way Home" for one of his solo projects (currently unpublished) and dedicated it to the memory of Albert.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.markmcgee.com/project.html | title = Solo Project | access-date = August 15, 2013 | publisher = Mark McGee Official Website}}</ref>

The band decided not to replace Albert at that time, and Thorpe assumed the role of vocalist for the band's next album: ''[[Something Burning (Album)|Something Burning]]''. This album was released in 1996 on the [[Massacre Records]] label. The song "Perpetual", included on the album, was the last track written with Albert. The resulting reviews of the new release were favorable,<ref name="allmusic.com"/> and VR subsequently undertook a European tour with Accept to support it. ''[[Cyberchrist (Album)|Cyberchrist]]'', their next studio album, was recorded and released in 1998 with newcomer Brian O'Connor on vocals. The band was invited by Blind Guardian to join them for 30 tour dates on their highly successful "Nightfall in Middle-Earth" European tour.<ref name=website/> The band then took some time off from touring and recording primarily to recruit new personnel. They recruited a new bass player, Cornbread, who replaced Tommy Sisco, and [[Ira Black (musician)|Ira Black]] (ex [[Heathen (band)|Heathen]]—later with [[Lizzy Borden (band)|Lizzy Borden]]) filled the spot left by departing guitarist Smyth. Session players Atma Anur, Dan Lawson and Will Carroll (later with [[Death Angel]]) briefly sat in for drummer Larry Howe—who at the time wanted to take some time off from touring and recording. The new lineup recorded and released ''[[Sadistic Symphony]]'' with vocalist Morgan Thorn in 2001, but O'Connor re-joined the band for live dates in the US and Europe in support of the new album.<ref name=website/>

There were no new releases by Vicious Rumors in 2002 or 2003. During this period, band leader Thorpe was asked by longtime friend [[Daniel Jones (guitarist)|Daniel Jones]] of [[rock & roll]] band [[7th Order (band)|7th Order]] to take part in recording sessions, alongside veteran British guitarist [[Martin Pugh]] (of [[Steamhammer (band)|Steamhammer]], [[An Old Raincoat Won't Ever Let You Down|the first Rod Stewart solo album]] and [[Armageddon (A&M band)|Armageddon]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rock.co.za/rockit/playlist051221.html | title = Playlist | access-date = August 14, 2013 | date = December 21, 2005 | work = 17).

=== Return to a traditional sound (2004–2012) ===
In 2004, in order to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the band's "Word of Mouth" release, there were some reunions (Thorpe, Howe, Sisco, plus McGee and Ira Black alternating on guitar and O'Connor on vocals). 2005 saw the release of the band's ''Crushing the World'' DVD,<ref name="blabbermouth.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vicious-rumors-to-crush-the-world-with-new-dvd/|title=Vicious Rumors To 'Crush The World' With New Dvd - Blabbermouth.net|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> which featured both current and historical Vicious Rumors lineups,<ref name="blabbermouth.net"/> and included several previously unreleased tracks: "Poveglia", "Broken Wings", "Fight", and "Immortal".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/dvd_3/vicious_rumors_4.htm|title=Vicious Rumors - Crushing The World (DVD)|website=Metal-temple.com|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref>

The album ''[[Warball]]'' (co-produced by Juan Urteaga) was recorded and released on the [[Mascot Records]] label in early 2006. Members Cornbread and O'Connor left the band prior to its recording, but original members Dave Starr (bass) and Larry Howe (drums) returned. Vocalist [[James Rivera]] (Helstar) and guitarists [[Brad Gillis]] ([[Night Ranger]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]]) and Thaen Rasmussen (Heathen, Anvil Chorus) contributed to the recordings of the new album. Worldwide sales were excellent and reviewers universally saw the ''Warball'' album as a genuine "return to form" of a more traditional Vicious Rumors sound after the more experimental releases of the post-Carl Albert incarnations of the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-temple.com/site/catalogues/entry/reviews/cd_3/v_2/vicious_rumors_3.htm|title=Vicious Rumors - Warball (CD)|website=Mteal-temple.com|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> Stephen Goodwin stepped in to serve as Vicious Rumors's touring bassist,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://movementinthrees.com/bio/stephen_goodwin.php | title = Stephen Goodwin - Bassist | access-date = August 15, 2013 | year = 2007 | publisher = Movement in Threes.com}}</ref> and the band played several dates in Europe, including shows with [[Agent Steel]], [[HammerFall]], [[Girlschool]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]], and [[Heaven & Hell (band)|Heaven & Hell]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=5767 |title=Features - Vicious Rumors Interview |website=Knac.com |access-date=August 27, 2016}}</ref>

Upon the band's return to the US, Ronnie Stixx (Divine Ruins, Blood Redskies, [[Shadowkeep]]) took over as an interim replacement for the a departing Rivera.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vicious-rumors-announce-new-singer/ | title = VICIOUS RUMORS Announces New Singer | access-date = August 15, 2013 | date = February 12, 2008 | publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> Rasmussen was replaced by Kiyoshi Morgan as second guitarist.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vicious-rumors-announces-new-guitarist/ | title = VICIOUS RUMORS Announces New Guitarist | access-date = August 15, 2013 | date = March 9, 2008 | publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref> Stixx was eventually replaced by Brian Allen (Last Empire, Wild Dogs).<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vicious-rumors-taps-last-empire-wild-dogs-singer/ | title = VICIOUS RUMORS Taps LAST EMPIRE/WILD DOGS Singer | access-date = August 15, 2013 | date = December 4, 2009 | publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref>

In 2009, Thorpe and Howe (alongside Allen, Goodwin and Morgan) acknowledged the 30th Anniversary of the inception of Vicious Rumors, by performing songs from their debut album, ''[[Soldiers of the Night]]'', with former singer Gary St. Pierre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/vicious-rumors-with-original-singer-gary-st-pierre-confirmed-headbangers-open-air-warm-up-show|title=VICIOUS RUMORS With Original Singer Gary St. Pierre Confirmed Headbangers Open Air Warm Up Show|work=bravewords.com|access-date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> at the Headbangers Open Air Festival.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.headbangers-open-air.de/en/index1.php?seite=news&datum=2008 | title = Headbanger's Open Air 2009 | access-date = August 15, 2013 | publisher = Headbanger's Open Air Official Website}}</ref>
In 2011, Mark McGee, Tommy Sisco and Kevin Albert (the son of late vocalist Carl Albert) sat in with the band for their performance at the Keep It True Festival, also in Germany.<ref name=website/>

The band signed to [[SPV GmbH|SPV]] Records, and their tenth album ''[[Razorback Killers]]'' was released on March 28, 2011. Several guests joined them for the sessions: Mark McGee, Brad Gillis, and Testament guitarist Eric Peterson. The album also marked the recording debuts of Goodwin, Morgan and Allen.<ref name=website/> The band then departed for an extensive European summer tour, headlining 60 shows and supporting [[HammerFall]] on 30 shows. In early 2012, the band took part in the first heavy metal sea cruise, [[70000 Tons of Metal]].

In late 2012, after a series of summer festival performances in Europe with new entry Bob Capka on second guitar, the band released a live album, recorded on tour with HammerFall in 2011 - engineered by Pontus Norgren (HammerFall guitarist and FOH engineer for King Diamond, Candlemass) - titled ''Live You to Death'' in November 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/vicious-rumors-to-release-live-you-to-death-live-album/ | title = VICIOUS RUMORS To Release 'Live You To Death' Live Albumt | access-date = August 15, 2013 | date = September 25, 2012 | publisher = [[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://entertaimnet.wordpress.com/2013/04/17/vicious-rumors-surfing-metal-and-the-electric-punishment/ | title = Vicious Rumors - Surfing Metal and Electric Punishment | access-date = August 15, 2013 | last = Rowhel | first = Dennis | date = April 17, 2013 | publisher = Entertain.net}}</ref>
