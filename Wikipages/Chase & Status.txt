==History==
===2003–09: Beginnings and ''More Than Alot''===
Saul Milton (Chase) and Will Kennard (Status) originally met in London through a mutual friend although met up again whilst university students in [[Manchester]]. Kennard studied History of Art at the [[University of Manchester]], while Milton studied English and Humanities at [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]. Kennard decided to drop out of university to pursue a music career although Milton did manage to achieve an honours in his studies despite spending most of his time on music.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Interview: Chase & Status |last=Nickell |first=Amy |url=http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Music/2011-05-16/interview_chase_and_status.html |work=The National Student |date=16 May 2011 |access-date=2012-04-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102064105/http://www.thenationalstudent.com/Music/2011-05-16/interview_chase_and_status.html |archive-date=2 November 2013 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Chase & Status had three number one singles on the [[UK Dance Chart]] between 2007–2009; the double A-side "Hurt You" / "Sell Me Your Soul" in 2007 and "Take Me Away" / "Judgement (Informer)" in 2008 were two of them. On 5 October 2008, they reached number seventy on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and number one on the UK Dance Chart again with their single "[[Pieces (Chase & Status song)|Pieces]]" featuring vocals from [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]]. In 2009, they peaked at number forty five with "[[Against All Odds (Chase & Status song)|Against All Odds]]", which featured UK rapper [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/artist/chase-status/id121546679|title=Chase & Status on Apple Music|website=Apple Music|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-10-05}}</ref>

===2009–2011: ''No More Idols''===
In November 2009, the duo entered the top forty of the UK Singles Chart for the first time with the track "[[End Credits]]". The track was released on 2 November 2009 and featuring [[Plan B (musician)|Plan B]], it reached a peak of number nine on the UK Singles Chart.

The duo released "[[Let You Go (song)|Let You Go]]" on 15 August 2010, revealing it to be the second single to be released from their second studio album ''[[No More Idols]]''. The single featured vocals from Mali and debuted at number eleven on the UK Singles Chart, marking the duo's second consecutive Top Forty hit. "Hypest Hype" (featuring [[Tempa T]]) was confirmed in October 2010 to be the third single from the album. Because it was released as a free download from their website on 8 November 2010, it did not qualify to chart. The fourth single from the album is "[[Blind Faith (Chase & Status song)|Blind Faith]]", which features soul singer/songwriter [[Liam Bailey]] and was released in January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/610/liam_bailey_soul_pride/|title=Liam Bailey: Soul pride|first=Stephen Clark -|last=Design|website=www.bluesandsoul.com}}</ref> Other singles include "[[Time (Chase & Status song)|Time]]" (featuring [[Delilah (musician)|Delilah]]), "[[Hitz (song)|Hitz]]" (featuring [[Tinie Tempah]]) and "[[Flashing Lights (Chase & Status song)|Flashing Lights]]" (with [[Sub Focus]] featuring [[Takura]]). The album also contains the song "Heavy" with [[Dizzee Rascal]]. The album debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart and was certified gold in the first week of sales by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].

===2012–2014: ''Brand New Machine''===
In contrast to ''[[More Than Alot]]'' and ''[[No More Idols]]'', the new album has a darker sound.<ref>[http://www.futureentertainment.com.au/music/interviews/1234-chase-and-status-the-sound-of-now/ Chase & Status interview by Georgia, 'Future Entertainment'] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113082029/http://www.futureentertainment.com.au/music/interviews/1234-chase-and-status-the-sound-of-now/ |date=13 January 2012 }}</ref> The duo performed as a sub-headline on Friday night at [[Download Festival]] 2012, provoking an outcry from regular Download enthusiasts (the festival is recognized as a rock/metal festival), not least due to them being higher on the bill than fan favourites [[Machine Head (band)|Machine Head]], who had been subject to an internet campaign to headline the festival.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/machineheadfordownload2012|title=Machine Head to Headline Download 2012|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref> However, they were well received. Chase & Status have also headlined electronic music festival South West Four hosted on London's Clapham Common. ''Chase & Status: Live at Brixton'', a CD/DVD featuring appearances from Tinie Tempah, Liam Bailey, Mali and Delilah, was released on 2 April 2012. On 15 October 2012, the track "Big Man" featuring [[Liam Bailey]] was released on the Chase & Status website as a free download. The following day it was released through online retailers.

===2016–2017: ''Tribe''===
The duo released their fourth studio album ''[[Tribe (Chase & Status album)|Tribe]]'' on 18 August 2017, and featured collaborations with artists such as [[Craig David]], [[Emeli Sandé]], [[Shy FX]] and Slaves. The album featured much more [[drum and bass]] compared to their last album ''[[Brand New Machine]]'', taking the band back to the sound which initially made them a commercial success, whilst still experimenting with other genres such as [[UK garage]] in their single "Reload" with [[Craig David]] and [[electronic rock]] in their track "Control" with British [[Punk rock|punk]] band Slaves.

===Remixes and productions===
The duo have also created a remix version of "[[Invaders Must Die (song)|Invaders Must Die]]" for [[the Prodigy]]. In Australia, the remix reached fifty three on the [[Aria Charts|Aria Singles Chart]] and number seven on the Aria Dance Chart. They have also produced for [[Rihanna]] numerous times, on her fourth album ''[[Rated R (Rihanna album)|Rated R]]'', sixth album ''[[Talk That Talk (Rihanna album)|Talk That Talk]]'' and seventh album "[[Unapologetic]]", as well as producing British singer [[Rita Ora]]'s number one UK hit, "[[R.I.P. (Rita Ora song)|R.I.P]]", and co-producing a track on [[Alexandra Burke]]'s album ''[[Overcome (Alexandra Burke album)|Overcome]]''. Other remixes include Black Canvas' "Broken Dreams", [[Dizzee Rascal]]'s "Sirens", [[Nneka (singer)|Nneka]]'s "Heartbeat" and [[Capleton]]'s "Who Dem" (renamed "Duppy Man").
