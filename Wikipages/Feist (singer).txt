==Early life==
Leslie Feist was born on 13 February 1976 in [[Amherst, Nova Scotia]], Canada. Her parents are both artists.  Her father, Harold Feist, was an American-Canadian [[abstract expressionism|abstract expressionist]] painter who taught at both the [[Alberta College of Art and Design]] and [[Mount Allison University]] in [[Sackville, New Brunswick]].<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/feist-emc | title =Feist | last =Higgs | first =Jennifer | date =22 March 2015 | website =The Canadian Encyclopedia | publisher =Historica Canada

Feist's parents divorced soon after she was born and Ben, Feist and their mother moved to [[Regina, Saskatchewan]], where they lived with her grandparents. They later moved to [[Calgary]], Alberta, where she attended [[Bishop Carroll High School (Calgary, Alberta)|Bishop Carroll High School]] as well as [[Alternative High School (Calgary)|Alternative High School]]. She aspired to be a writer, and spent much of her youth singing in choirs.<ref name="Toronto_Life">{{cite journal|last=Stren |first=Olivia |title=Dream girl |journal=[[Toronto Life]] |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=58–62 |date=July 2007 |url=http://www.torontolife.com/features/dream-girl/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713173729/http://www.torontolife.com/features/dream-girl/ |archive-date=13 July 2007 }}</ref> At the age of 12, Feist performed as one of 1,000 dancers in the opening ceremonies of the [[1988 Winter Olympics|Calgary Winter Olympics]], which she cites as inspiration for the video "1234."

Because her father is American, Feist has dual Canadian-U.S. citizenship,<ref>[https://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/entertainment/reviews.nsf/concert/story/CDA498AA8ECEFE7E8625742B002251D6?OpenDocument] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> joking later that she was given U.S. citizenship as part of a deal with [[Apple Inc.|Apple]].<ref>In an appearance on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on 28 April 2008, Feist joked that she is a dual citizen and holds a U.S. passport, having been offered American citizenship "as part of the iPod deal."</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Transcript of episode 4056 of The Colbert Report|date=28 April 2008|url=http://www.nofactzone.net/?p=3621|publisher=Nofactzone.net|access-date=21 May 2014}}</ref>

==Music career==
In 1991, at age 15, Feist got her start in music when she founded and was the lead vocalist for a Calgary punk band called Placebo (not to be confused with the English band [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]]).<ref name="Toronto_Life" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/events/feist-to-play-3-hometown-shows-in-calgary-1.4296636|title=Kicking off the 2017-18 Taylor Centre Concert Series at MRU|work=CBC News|access-date=23 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> She and her bandmates won a local Battle of the Bands competition and were awarded the opening slot at the festival Infest 1993, featuring [[the Ramones]]. At this concert she met [[Brendan Canning]], whose band [[hHead]] performed immediately before hers, and with whom she joined in [[Broken Social Scene]] ten years later.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ithaca.com/entertainment/broken-social-scene-back-at-it-again/article_063413fa-98ae-11e7-85ff-078c5f26ddf5.html|title=Broken Social Scene: Back at it again|last=Citranglo|first=Christie|work=Ithaca Times|access-date=23 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>

In 1995, Feist was forced to take time off from music to recover from vocal cord damage. She moved from Calgary to Toronto in 1996. That year she was asked by [[Noah Mintz]] of [[hHead]] to play bass in his solo project [[Noah's Arkweld]]. She played the bass guitar in Noah's Arkweld for a year despite never having played bass before. In 1998, she became the rhythm guitarist for the band [[By Divine Right]] and toured with them throughout 1998, 1999, and 2000. She also played guitar for some live performances by [[Bodega (Canadian band)|Bodega]], but was never an official member of the band.<ref>"Feist Inside and Out". ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 21 April 2007.</ref>

In 1999, Feist moved into a [[Queen Street West|Queen West]] apartment above [[Come As You Are (sex shop)|Come As You Are]] with a friend of a friend, [[Merrill Nisker]], who then began to perform as electro-punk musician [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogto.com/music/2010/09/feist_documentary_to_be_released_soon/ |title=Feist documentary to be released soon |publisher=Blogto.com |date=24 September 2010 |access-date=22 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/30/on-my-radar-feist-alejandro-jodorowsky-dune|title=On my radar: Feist's cultural highlights|last=Bromwich|first=Kathryn|date=30 July 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=30 July 2017|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Feist worked the back of the stage at Peaches' shows, using a [[sock puppet]] and calling herself "Bitch Lap Lap".<ref>{{cite news| last =Everett-Green| first =Robert| title =Grammy girl: Feist| pages =R1, R19| newspaper =[[The Globe and Mail]]| date =9 February 2008| url =https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080208.wgrammy09/BNStory/Entertainment/home| url-status =dead| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090116071938/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080208.wgrammy09/BNStory/Entertainment/home| archive-date =16 January 2009| df =dmy-all}}</ref> The two also toured together in England from 2000–2001, staying with [[Justine Frischmann]] of [[Elastica]] and [[M.I.A.

In 2006, Feist contributed backup vocals on a track entitled "Give 'Er", which appeared on [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches']] album ''[[Impeach My Bush]].''

===''Monarch (Lay Your Jewelled Head Down)'' (1999–2001)===
Feist's solo debut album, ''Monarch,'' was released in 1999. It is composed of ten songs, including "Monarch" and "That's What I Say, It's Not What I Mean." The album was produced by Dan Kurtz, who would later form [[Dragonette]].

===''Let It Die'' (2001–2006)===
In the summer of 2001, Feist self-produced seven songs at home which she called ''The Red Demos,'' which have never been released commercially. She spent more than two years touring throughout Europe with Gonzales. In that same year she joined a group of old friends in forming a new version of Toronto indie rock group [[Broken Social Scene]], adding vocals to many tracks after being forbidden to play guitar by de facto bandleader [[Kevin Drew]].<ref>Berman, Stuart. ''[[This Book is Broken]]''</ref> She subsequently recorded ''[[You Forgot It in People]]'' with the band. While on tour in Europe with Gonzales, they began recording new versions of her home recorded ''Red Demos,'' which would later become her major label debut ''[[Let It Die (album)|Let It Die]].'' ''Let It Die'' featured both original compositions and covers, and Feist has been noted both as a songwriter and as an innovative interpreter of other artists' songs.

After the recording of ''Let It Die,'' Feist moved to Paris. While in Europe, she collaborated with Norwegian duo [[Kings of Convenience]] as co-writer and guest vocalist on their album ''[[Riot on an Empty Street]],'' singing on "Know How," and "The Build Up." She also co-wrote and sang "The Simple Story" as a duet with [[Jane Birkin]] on her album ''Rendezvous.''

In September 2010, Feist announced through her website the release of a documentary film about the creative process of making of ''The Reminder'', called ''[[Look at What the Light Did Now]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listentofeist.com/news/archive/2010/september/lookatwhatthe |title=Look at What The Light Did Now – Feist |publisher=Listentofeist.com |date=22 September 2010 |access-date=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101227013430/http://www.listentofeist.com/news/archive/2010/september/lookatwhatthe |archive-date=27 December 2010 }}</ref> It was directed by Canadian film director Anthony Seck and was shot on [[Super 8 mm film]].  The film was released on DVD in December 2010, and a limited series of screenings were conducted including a Toronto screening at the Royal Ontario Museum, which featured a post-film interview of Feist by [[George Stroumboulopoulos]].

Bonus materials on the DVD include "This One Jam", an early performance of Feist with Gonzales at Trash Club; live performances from the Reminder tour; and two short films: "The Water" starring Feist and "Departures" starring Kevin Drew and based on an idea by Feist.
