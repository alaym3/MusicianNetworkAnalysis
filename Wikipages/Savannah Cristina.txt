In 2019, she told ''[[Miami New Times]]'', "I was raised by my church. I was raised by my school. I was raised by my Boys & Girls Club. I was really raised by the poetry teachers who took their time to invest in my art. All of those people created the woman I am today."<ref name="MNT19">{{cite web |last1=Hardy |first1=Shanae |title=Savannah Cristina's Latest EP, ''Self Care'', Gives Us All the Feels |url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/music/interview-with-savannah-cristina-on-the-release-of-her-new-ep-self-care-11710251 |website=Miami New Times |date=15 October 2020 |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref> She attended [[Stranahan High School]],<ref name="MH20">{{cite web |last1=Hamersly |first1=Mike |title=Jazz in the Gardens fest: Pay attention to South Florida's Savannah Cristina |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/indulge/restaurants/article241099931.html |website=Miami Herald |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref> and graduated from [[Florida International University]] with a degree in political science.<ref name="MNT19" />

== Career beginnings ==

Cristina began singing in church as well as local community events. She told ''[[American Songwriter]]'' that she discovered her love of music in second grade, when a choir teacher told her she had a gift.<ref name="AmSongwriter">{{cite web |last1=Uitti |first1=Jacob |title=Savannah Cristina Starts in One Place and Ends in Revolution |url=https://americansongwriter.com/self-care-savannah-cristina-song-interview/ |website=American Songwriter |date=12 October 2020 |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref> In high school, she started a poetry club and participated in slam competitions, studying performers like [[Aja Monet]] and Bertrand Boyd. In April 2016, she signed with the management company TheNuMiami, LLC, which posted her first single, "Spend It on Me," on SoundCloud.<ref name="NuMiami">{{cite web |title=Savannah Cristina - Spend It on Me |url=https://thenumiami.com/2016/06/savannah-cristina-spend-it-on-me/ |website=TheNuMiami |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref>

In 2017, she released ''Mango Season''. The title, she told ''The PoPular Society'' in 2017, was inspired by the mango trees that bloom in Fort Lauderdale every summer.<ref name="PoP">{{cite web |last1=D |first1=J. |title=Savannah Cristina Breaks Down the Mango Season EP |url=http://www.thepopularsociety.com/savannah-cristina-breaks-mango-season-ep/ |website=The PoPular Society |date=3 August 2017 |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref> The following year, she released ''Florida Girl''. She also collaborated with South Florida artists such as Twelve’Len, [[¡Mayday!]], and Ice Billion Berg, and contributed backing vocals to a track on [[Denzel Curry|Denzel Curry's]] 2018 album ''[[Ta13oo]]''.

In 2019, Savannah Cristina signed a record deal with Dollaz N Dealz. She posted videos herself performing around her neighborhood, including a basketball court (for “Rebound”) and a busy intersection (for “Belong to the Streets”). She told ''[[Rated R&B]]'', "I got to a point where I wanted people to see what I'm doing, and if that means I have to go out into the street or go into the middle of the beach or go to a basketball court, I'm going to get your attention. So, that's where the inspiration came from. I came up with the idea myself and I love the way everybody accepted the way that they did."<ref name="RR&B">{{cite web |last1=Samuels |first1=Keithan |title=How Savannah Cristina Uses Her Music to Provide Soul Therapy |url=https://ratedrnb.com/2020/08/how-savannah-cristina-uses-her-music-to-provide-soul-therapy/ |website=Rated R&B |date=21 August 2020 |access-date=24 November 2020}}</ref> She told ''[[Flaunt]]'', "All these spots I pick are places from my childhood. The basketball court, I grew up going to that court playing with my dad. That street is the street I caught the city bus to go to school."<ref name="Flaunt" />

Her "Self Care" video was filmed at a local beach. It went viral and eventually garnered 6 million views. She told ''Yahoo! Life'' that she was motivated to make the clip because "I felt like I was neglecting myself. I felt like as a woman, as a person, I was neglecting my feelings [and] my responsibilities that I had to myself."<ref name="YahooLife" />

Warner Records began courting her after she released her single, "What You Won't Do," and signed her to a deal in January 2020.<ref name="Flaunt" /> Her major label debut, ''Self Care'', was released on October 2, 2020.

== Style ==

Savannah Cristina has called her music "soul therapy"<ref name="RR&B" /> and "pieces of my diary."<ref name="MNT19" /> Her influences include [[Beyoncé]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[PartyNextDoor]] and [[Lauryn Hill]]. 
 
She told ''American Songwriter'', "There's no other setting for me to talk about these things," she says. "I'm somebody that, if you know me, I'm very distant. I dissociate myself from emotions for as long as I can. I don't like saying what's wrong or talking about myself very much. But in music, I can express a side of myself that's very open, very emotional. Even if it's embarrassing or too personal. I almost have to do it."
