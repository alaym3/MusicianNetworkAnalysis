==Music career==
Diab has released his first album entitled ''Ya Tareeq'' in 1983. Diab's second album, ''Ghanny Men Albak'' (1984), which was the first of a series of records he released with Delta Sound; including ''Hala Hala'' (1986), ''Khalseen'' (1987), and ''Mayyal'' (1988), with the title track becoming one of the top 10 songs in the world at the time. His later releases include ''Shawa'na'' (1989), ''Matkhafesh'' (1990), ''Habibi'' (1991), ''Ayyamna'' (1992), ''Ya Omrena'' (1993), ''Weylomony'' (1994), and ''Rag'een'' (1995). In 1996, Diab released his first album with [[Alam El Phan]] entitled ''[[Nour El Ain]]'',and he won the world music award for the first time which proved an international success and gained Diab recognition beyond the Arabic-speaking world. Diab recorded four more albums with Alam El Phan, including ''Amarain'' (1999). Diab also collaborated with [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] (on the song "Alby") and with [[Angela Dimitriou]] (on the song "Bahebak Aktar").

In the summer of 2004, Diab, having left Alam El Phan, released his first album with [[Rotana Records]], ''[[Leily Nahary|Leily Nehary]],'' which he followed up with the hugely successful ''[[Kammel Kalamak]]'' (2005), and ''[[El Lilady]]'' (2007).

''[[Wayah]]'' was released for sale on the internet on [[June 27|27 June]] [[2009]]; however, the album was leaked online and was downloaded illegally amid complaints of slow download speed on the official site. Diab's fans initiated a massive boycott of the sites with the illegal copies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amr Diab's album sweeping cassette market |url=http://www.musicananet.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=831:2009-06-30-21-53-47&catid=55:2009-02-18-21-10-52&Itemid=93 |date=30 June 2009 |publisher=Musicananet |access-date=2 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090704070007/http://www.musicananet.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=831%3A2009-06-30-21-53-47&catid=55%3A2009-02-18-21-10-52&Itemid=93 |archive-date=4 July 2009 |language=ar }}</ref>

== Music videos ==

== Film career ==

Diab's fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, ''El Afareet'', which was released in 1989. It also starred [[Madiha Kamel]]. His second film ''Ice Cream in Gleam'' (''Ays Krim fi Glym''), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the [[UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television]]. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive's new program "Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films" at James Bridges Theater at UCLA on 6, 8 and 10 April 1999. David Chute of the ''Los Angeles Weekly'' termed it "observant" and "a big leap".<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Chute |first2=Irene G. |last2=Behnan |title= All Singing!

The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star [[Omar Sharif]] (''[[Lawrence of Arabia (film)|Lawrence of Arabia]]'', ''[[Doctor Zhivago (film)|Doctor Zhivago]]'') and [[Yousra]]. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career.
