'''Wendy & Lisa''' (briefly known as '''Girl Bros.''') are a music duo consisting of [[Wendy Melvoin]] and [[Lisa Coleman (musician)|Lisa Coleman]]. They began working with [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] in the early 1980s and were part of his band [[The Revolution (band)|The Revolution]], before branching out on their own and releasing their debut album in 1987. In recent years they have turned their attention to writing music for film and television and have won an [[Emmy Award]].<ref name="emmys1">[http://www.emmys.com/sites/emmys.com/files/CRTV2010winners_pressrel.pdf 2010 Creative Arts Emmy Award winners PDF]</ref>

They have released five full-length albums, the most recent being ''[[White Flags of Winter Chimneys]]'', released in December 2008.

==History==
===With The Revolution===
In 1980, Lisa Coleman replaced [[Gayle Chapman]] in Prince's touring band<ref>Nilsen, p. 82; Hahn, p. 34</ref> on keyboards and piano. Coleman was asked to contribute vocals to several tracks over his next few albums. In 1983, guitarist [[Dez Dickerson]] left the band over religious conflicts. Prince invited [[Wendy Melvoin]] (Lisa's girlfriend at the time) into the band as they began to record ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]''.<ref>Nilsen, p. 139; Hahn, p. 54</ref> The film and album turned Prince and the newly named [[The Revolution (band)|Revolution]] into superstars. Prince's personal life also became intertwined with Melvoin's when he began dating her twin sister [[Susannah Melvoin|Susannah]].

After ''Purple Rain'', Prince and The Revolution recorded ''[[Around the World in a Day]]'' and then ''[[Parade (Prince album)|Parade]]'', the soundtrack to Prince's film ''[[Under the Cherry Moon]]''. In interviews, the two reported they felt they were not getting the recognition and credit they deserved despite their growing contributions to his work.<ref>Hahn, p. 100-101</ref> During 1986, Melvoin and Coleman became increasingly disillusioned with Prince's decision to expand The Revolution with non-musicians, such as Wally Safford and Greg Brooks, and Prince's increasing ''[[machismo]]'' that these new members brought with them. Unhappy and vocal about their feelings, they were eventually convinced to remain with the band through the end of the [[Hit N Run - Parade Tour]]. However, Prince felt spurned and as a result he had already decided he would dissolve The Revolution once the tour was complete. Hence, by October 1986, Melvoin and Coleman (along with [[Bobby Z.]]) were dismissed by Prince, disrupting the ''[[Dream Factory (album)|Dream Factory]]'' album that was already completed and effectively dissolving The Revolution.<ref>Hahn, p. 104-107</ref>

===As Wendy & Lisa===
The next year, the duo released an album simply entitled ''[[Wendy and Lisa (album)|Wendy and Lisa]]'' with [[Columbia Records]]. They released a follow up album, ''[[Fruit at the Bottom]],'' in 1989. The albums and singles from them garnered minor chart success (including a Top 30 single in the UK).

In 1990, the duo signed with [[Virgin Records]] in the US (which was already their label in Europe) and released ''[[Eroica (album)|Eroica]]''. However, this too met only minor chart success. In 1991, Virgin UK released the remix album ''Re-mix-In-a-Carnation'', a selection of club mixes from the first three albums as [[remix]]ed by producers like [[The Orb]], [[William Orbit]], and [[Nellee Hooper]].

In the mid-1990s, Wendy & Lisa worked on several movie projects with record producer [[Trevor Horn]]. They also worked on an album with him as producer, but had a falling out (according to them, due to Horn and his wife's [[homophobia]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/2009/04/16/revolution-will-be-harmonized|title=The Revolution Will Be Harmonized|date=16 April 2009|work=out.com|access-date=6 Feb 2019}}</ref> and the project was shelved, leaving the master tapes in Horn's hands and acrimony between the parties involved. They have also done session work and/or written songs with [[Seal (musician)|Seal]], [[k.d. lang]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Meshell Ndegeocello]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Terence Trent D'arby]], [[Lisa Germano]], [[Lisa Marie Presley]], [[Liz Phair]], [[Michael Penn]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Tricky (musician)|Tricky]], [[The Three O'Clock]], [[Uh Huh Her (band)|Uh Huh Her]], [[Sheryl Crow]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Rob Thomas (musician)|Rob Thomas]], [[Gwen Stefani]], [[Skye Edwards]], [[Scritti Politti]], [[Nerina Pallot]], [[OK Go]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[The Like]], [[Nina Gordon]], [[The Family (band)|fDeluxe]], [[The Family (band)|The Family]], [[Doyle Bramhall II]], [[Nikka Costa]], [[André Cymone]], [[Kate Earl]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Bettye LaVette]], [[Ilse Delange]], [[Mac Miller]],  [[Walk the Moon]].  and more and vocals on the soundtrack for ''[[Toys (film)|Toys]]'' and their first scoring work, for ''[[Dangerous Minds]]'',They have since raised their profile considerably in that arena, scoring the popular TV shows ''[[Crossing Jordan]]'', ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' and more recently ''[[Touch (American TV series)|Touch]]'', all of them created and produced by [[Tim Kring]], and ''[[Nurse Jackie]]'' for Showtime.

Not being signed to any label, their next solo effort – the 1998 album ''[[Girl Bros.]]'' – was the first to be independently released, with all subsequent releases also self-released. 

In 2004, the duo reached a rapprochement with Prince and contributed to several tracks on his ''[[Planet Earth (Prince album)|Planet Earth]]'' album.

In December 2008, ''[[White Flags of Winter Chimneys]]'' was released. The title is taken from a line in the [[Joni Mitchell]] song "[[Hejira (song)|Hejira]]". 2011 saw the release of the ''[[Snapshots (EP)|Snapshots]]'' EP, which came with limited edition artwork, autographs and a photo book. It is a 6-track collection of songs that were recorded over the preceding 20 years of their careers but had previously never been released.
