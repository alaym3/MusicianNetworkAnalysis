'''Hanne Krogh Sundbø''' (born 24 January 1956) is a Norwegian singer and actress from [[Haugesund]] and Oslo. She is well known for winning the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1985]] with [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] in the group [[Bobbysocks!]].

== Personal life ==
She is the mother of poker player [[Sverre Krogh Sundbø]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pokker, heller – Nå skal Norges beste spiller kåres|last=Kemp|first=Anders Waaler|date=8 October 2005|work=VG|page=74|language=Norwegian}}</ref>

== Career ==
She officially started singing when she was 9 years old, and released her first album when she was 14.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rockipedia.no/mediateket/norsk-pop-og-rockleksikon-2005/hanne_krogh/|title=Hanne Krogh " Norsk pop- og rockleksikon (2005) " Rockipedia|last=Rockheim|website=Rockipedia|language=nb-NO|access-date=6 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006214142/http://www.rockipedia.no/mediateket/norsk-pop-og-rockleksikon-2005/hanne_krogh/|archive-date=6 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
She represented Norway with the song "Lykken er" in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest.
She has received major acclaim through Norwegian awards. Among them are numerous Spellemann (Norwegian Grammy) including the Honorary Award, and the [[Peer Gynt Prize]], which is awarded by members of the Parliament to those Norwegians who have done the most to gain Norway's reputation abroad. In addition to her own projects, she is also frequently asked to act as [[Master of ceremonies|MC]] at conventions, often in relation to female [[entrepreneurship]].

In 2012, she toured Norway with two major sold-out shows that she had written and directed. She also made numerous television appearances. In 2013, Hanne decided to mark the 100-year anniversary of [[women's suffrage]] in Norway by focusing toward [[violence against women]], and brought to light of unknown admirable women. This also included recording a new studio album ''Ikke gi deg, jente''.

In 2015, her new-written show "World of Music" gained another standing ovation, both from the audience and from the critics.

Krogh has released 27 albums, including a compilation, ''Hanne Krogh: 40 beste'' in 1994, and many other singles.
