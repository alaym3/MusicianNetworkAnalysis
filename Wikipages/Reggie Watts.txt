'''Reginald Lucien Frank Roger Watts''' (born March 23, 1972) is an American comedian, actor, beatboxer and musician. His improvised musical sets are created using only his voice, a keyboard and a looping machine. Watts refers to himself as a disinformationist who aims to disorient his audience, often in a comedic fashion. He appeared on the [[IFC (U.S. TV channel)|IFC]] series ''[[Comedy Bang! Bang! (TV series)|Comedy Bang! Bang!]]'' and leads the [[house band]] for ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''.<ref name="SSart">{{cite web|url=http://splitsider.com/2014/12/cbs-announces-reggie-watts-will-be-late-late-shows-band-leader-next-year/|title=CBS Announces Reggie Watts Will Be 'Late Late Show's Band Leader Next Year|author=Wright, Megh|date=December 12, 2014|work=[[Splitsider]]|access-date=December 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216035227/http://splitsider.com/2014/12/cbs-announces-reggie-watts-will-be-late-late-shows-band-leader-next-year/|archive-date=December 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early career (1996{{ndash}}2009)===
[[File:Reggie Watts 2013.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Watts performing in March 2013]]
In 1996, Watts became the front man for soul, rock, and hip hop group [[Maktub]].<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.reggiewatts.com/bio |title=Reggie Watts Official Biography |publisher=Reggiewatts.com |access-date=May 29, 2012}}</ref><ref name="nyt"/>

While recording and touring circa 1996–2000 with [[Wayne Horvitz]] 4+1 Ensemble as a keyboardist, Watts was forced to downsize his effects pedal from a [[Roland Space Echo]] tape delay to a [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] [[Line 6 DL4|DL4]] delay modeler, a smaller device that makes it easy to travel. He began using the Line 6 in live shows with [[Maktub]], in order to replicate the duplicate harmonies from the recorded material. He experimented with improvising entire songs in solo acts with the Line 6, while trying to sound like [[Tom Waits]], playing initial gigs at small Seattle venues and artist bungalows. While in Seattle, Watts composed musical scores for Northwest dance choreographers and he dabbled in sketch comedy with future theatrical collaborator [[Tommy Smith (playwright)|Tommy Smith]].<ref name="SunBreak">{{cite news|last=Barker|first=Jeremy M.|title=Reggie Watts & Tommy Smith's Long Road Back to on the Boards|url=http://thesunbreak.com/2009/10/14/reggie-watts-tommy-smiths-long-road-back-to-on-the-boards/|newspaper=[[The SunBreak]]|date=October 14, 2009}}</ref>

In 2004, after recording five albums over eight years, Watts moved to the [[Lower East Side]], New York City. In 2005, he recorded his first solo single, "So Beautiful". Inspired by ''[[The State (1993 TV series)|The State]]'' and ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', he began infusing spontaneous comedic material with the beat-box-driven musical compositions.<ref>{{cite news|last=Klickstein|first=Mathew|title=Reggie Watts, Conan O'Brien's hip-hop comic coming to the Fox|url=http://www.coloradodaily.com/ci_18657736?source%3Dmost_viewed#axzz1wEFwFuu2|newspaper=Colorado Daily|date=August 11, 2011}}</ref> He shot comedic web shorts for Superdeluxe, [[Vimeo]] and [[CollegeHumor]].

In 2007, Watts appeared on [[Plum TV]]'s ''Scott Bateman Presents Scott Bateman Presents'' and starred in the [[CollegeHumor]] internet video "What About Blowjobs?" The video became a viral hit. The same year, he also wrote and performed the theme song for ''[[Penelope Princess of Pets]]'', a web comedy series featuring [[Kristen Schaal]] and [[H. Jon Benjamin]].

In 2008, Watts recorded a new special entitled ''Disinformation,'' which features his performance at the Under the Radar Festival at the Public Theater.

He then did voice work for an episode of [[Adult Swim (UK & Ireland)|Adult Swim]]'s ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'' as "The Delivery Guy", Australia's ''[[Good News Week]]'', and appeared in the US documentary ''[[The Yes Men Fix the World]]''.

A: We Are Devo!]]'' and ''[[Freedom of Choice (album)|Freedom of Choice]]'' played in full.

In 2010, Waverly Films shot a one-hour special on Watts called ''[[Why Shit So Crazy?]]'' The special features Watts in live performance at New York venues Galapagos, The Bellhouse, and [[(Le) Poisson Rouge]], bookended with brief sketches and a music video of Watts' "Fuck Shit Stack". [[Comedy Central]] aired ''Why Shit So Crazy?'' and released the film as a dual DVD/CD package.<ref name="nyt">{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|author-link=Dave Itzkoff|title=Always the Quick-Change Artist, From Skits to Songs to Stand-Ups|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/29/arts/television/29reggie.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 28, 2010}}</ref> Afterwards, Watts made various public appearances, including in [[Conan O'Brien]]'s ''[[The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour]]''.

In 2014, Watts contributed the outro vocal on "Holy City" and beatbox on "The Classic" from the [[Joan As Police Woman]] album [[The Classic (Joan as Police Woman album)|''The Classic'']]. He also appeared as the last act in the season 4 premiere of ''[[John Oliver's New York Stand-Up Show]]'' where he told some jokes and performed a song, hugging John Oliver at the end.

In December 2014, following CBS's announcement that Watts would lead ''The Late Late Show'' band, Aukerman announced that Watts would remain with ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' through only the first half of 2015.<ref name="SSart" /> Watts' final episode of ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'' was on June 5, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2015/02/19/comedy-bang-bang-passes-the-mic-to-kid-cudi-71305/20150219ifc01/|title=Breaking News - "Comedy Bang!

===''The Late Late Show with James Corden'' and ''Spatial'' (2015{{ndash}}present)===
Watts currently serves as the bandleader and announcer for ''[[The Late Late Show with James Corden]]''. He has described his role on the show as "... a mix of [[Paul Shaffer]] and [[Andy Richter]]."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kavner|first1=Lucas|title=Reggie Watts on His New Gig As Bandleader of The Late Late Show and Why He Was Initially Annoyed by the Offer|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/reggie-watts-late-late-show-bandleader.html|publisher=Vulture|access-date=April 4, 2015}}</ref> His band on the show was unofficially named "Karen",<ref>{{cite web|last1=Daly|first1=Kyle|title=Reggie Watts' Late Late Show band is just called Karen|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/reggie-watts-late-late-show-band-just-called-karen-216960|publisher=AV Club|access-date=April 4, 2015}}</ref> but in response to [[Karen (slang)|Karen being used as a pejorative]], the band was renamed "Melissa".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W5ASqB8Uj4Y&list=PLZ1f3amS4y1dL8w1B7gqJ1paItNh_9Hym|title=Bye 'Karen' - LLS Band Gets a New Name - 3 Things|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> Watts has a slot on the show to ask a guest a question about anything (called Reggie's Question on show clips).  The questions are a continuation of his time on ''Comedy Bang! Bang!'', and follow his preference for surreal comedy in his stand-up act.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sandberg|first1=Bryn|title='Late Late Show' Bandleader Reggie Watts on Dual Role, 'Comedy Bang! Bang!'

==Performance style==
Watts's solo shows are completely improvised<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2015/08/01/428415046/reggie-watts-man-of-many-voices-improvised-his-way-to-success|title=Reggie Watts, Man Of Many Voices, Improvised His Way To Success|website=NPR.org|language=en|access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> and consist of him singing and rapping both with words and with [[sound poetry]], accompanying himself by either [[beatboxing]], performing vocal basslines into a loop machine, or simply by playing the keyboard. His act also showcases his trademark style of [[standup comedy]], consisting of him rapidly alternating between topics of discussion in both rational and nonsensical manners, making random sounds and noises, and speaking in other accents, languages, and gibberish at unexpected times, all with the intent of playfully and comically disorienting his audiences.<ref name="guardian review">{{cite web|title=Reggie Watts – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/19/reggie-watts-review|last=Logan|first=Brian|date=June 19, 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=February 24, 2018}}</ref> He has a four and a half octave [[vocal range]], and adopts a wide variety of voices and accents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/arts/comics/profiles/66280/index1.html|title=The Mad Liberationist|website=NYMag.com|access-date=September 4, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a5273/reggie-watts-goes-solo-1208/|title=The YouTube Star Who's Crazy in a Funny Way|date=December 2, 2008|work=Esquire|access-date=September 4, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref>
