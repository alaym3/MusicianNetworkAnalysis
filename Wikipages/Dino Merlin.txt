He is widely known for his distinctive voice, stage performances and poetic lyrics.

==Early life== 
Edin Dervišhalidović was born on 12 September 1962, in the historic neighbourhood of [[Alifakovac]] in [[Sarajevo]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|SR Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which was a republic of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]].<ref name="aljazeera.net">[http://balkans.aljazeera.net/vijesti/sredinom-ekranizirana-zivotna-prica-dine-merlina "Sredinom, ekranizirana životna priča Dine Merlina"]. 19 March 2017.</ref> The Dervišhalidović family traces its origins to [[Novi Pazar]]. Dino's father, Abid, was a carpenter who came to Sarajevo as a teenager. His mother, Fatima (née Činjarević), born and raised in Sarajevo, was a Muslim cleric.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://playboy.hr/2015/01/20-pitanja-dino-merlin/|title=20 pitanja: Dino Merlin &#124;|date=31 January 2015|website=Playboy Hrvatska}}</ref> His parents divorced when he was 7 years old and he was subsequently raised by his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/zabava/vesti/ispovest-dina-merlina-rastao-sam-bez-oca-kao-ptica-bez-jednog-krila/mgrlkzh|title=Ispovest Dina Merlina: "Rastao sam bez oca kao ptica bez jednog krila"|publisher=Blic|date=29 April 2012|access-date=30 May 2016}}</ref>

Dino attended the historic Moris Moco Salom elementary school where he was very active as a child, captaining its soccer, basketball and table tennis teams. The school and its historic surroundings - [[Emperor's Mosque]], [[President Tito]]'s residence {{ill|Konak na Bistriku|bs|lt=Konak}} and [[Hotel Nacional (album)|Hotel Nacional]], all influenced his later art.<ref name="aljazeera.net"/>

On his mother's insistence, and contrary to his own wishes of attending music school, Dino enrolled into the Sarajevo Technical High School. After school hours, he performed in a music duo with his childhood friend and keyboard player Mirsad Lutvica with whom he later established the band "Merlin".

==Music career==
===Early years===
Although Dino's mother was against the idea of her son being a musician, she did help Dino buy his first guitar when he was 12 years old.<ref>[https://www.klix.ba/magazin/muzika/merlin-komsijama-sam-unosio-cumur-da-bih-kupio-prvu-gitaru/120430015 "Merlin: Komšijama sam unosio ćumur da bih kupio prvu gitaru"].</ref> After learning his first chords, Dino began writing his own melodies and lyrics. He penned his first song at 14 years old. Dino was mostly selftaught although he did take a couple lessons from an older neighbour called Mirsad. Mirsad's younger brother, Mensur Lutvica, played the keyboard and attended the same school as Dino. They soon became best friends and eventually became the founding members of the later band 'Merlin'. Mensur began accompanying Dino while performing on the streets of Sarajevo.

Dino was heavily influenced by the Yugoslavian musicians [[Bijelo Dugme]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], [[Kemal Monteno]], [[Toma Zdravković]], among others.<ref>[http://depo.ba/clanak/162917/kad-su-cola-i-brega-dosli-kod-dine-merlina-na-bajram-majka-nije-bila-odusevljena-sejtani-kao-i-ti "Kad su Čola i Brega došli kod Dine Merlina na Bajram, majka nije bila oduševljena: 'Šejtani, kao i ti...'"].</ref> He entered several music competitions covering the songs of the aforementioned artists. He would later even become close friends with [[Goran Bregovic]], the founder and primary songwriter of Bijelo Dugme.

After enrolling in university, Dino formed a band, with Mensur on keyboards, Amir "Tula" Bjelanović on guitar, Džafer Saračević on drums and Enver Milišić on bass guitar. Each of the five put a paper with their idea for a band name in a hat; the name "Merlin" was the first to be pulled out of the hat, which they named the band.<ref>[http://mondo.rs/a1031727/Zabava/Zvezde-i-tracevi/Dino-Merlin-pravo-ime.html "Znate li njegovo ime?"].</ref>

===First album, period of struggle===
After completing his first semester at university, Dino soon dropped out in order to pursue a music career. However, he did not have enough money to enter a recording studio. During this time he married his high-school sweetheart Amela, and soon found himself working two shifts a day at a metal factory in the suburbs of Sarajevo in order to support his newly formed marriage. Dino ended up working in the factory for a couple of years before earning enough money to consider making an album.<ref>[https://www.kurir.rs/stars/1661326/dino-merlin-prvi-put-o-sebi-da-nisam-pevac-radio-bih-u-fabrici-lezajeva "DINO MERLIN PRVI PUT O SEBI: Da nisam pevač, radio bih u fabrici ležajeva!"].</ref> It was during the long nights at the assembly lane that he started writing most of the songs which would later be present in his first LP.

In 1984, Dino entered a local studio in [[Sarajevo]] owned by producer [[Brano Likić]]. All of the songs recorded were written by Dino while the fees of the recording were paid from Dino's personal funds. During this time, Dino was rejected by every major record label in Sarajevo. At the same time, Dino's private funds were only enough for about 6 songs with the norm of the day being 10 songs for a proper album. During the recording session of the final song, a local A&R agent Muradif Brkić entered the studio where Dino and Brano were mixing a song, which later turned out be Kokuzna Vremena. After listening to the track a couple of times, Muradif offered Dino a contract with his record label "Sarajevodisk" on the spot and agreed to finance the remainder of the song recordings. Eventually, Merlin was able to release its first album in 1985 with the leading single [[Kokuzna vremena]] - the same song which gave Dino and his band a lifeline into the music industry.<ref>[http://www.dinomerlin.com/index.php?s=muzika&id=21&t= "Kokuzna vremena | 1985"]. ''www.dinomerlin.com''.</ref>
With the band, he has recorded 5 studio albums: ''[[Kokuzna vremena]]'' in 1985, ''Teško meni sa tobom ''in 1986, ''[[Merlin (Merlin album)|Merlin]]'' in 1987, ''[[Nešto lijepo treba da se desi]]'' in 1989, and ''[[Peta strana svijeta]]'' in 1990. 

===Solo career===
[[File:Dino Merlin.jpg|thumb|Dino in 2008.]]

Dervišhalidović began his solo career under the name Dino Merlin in 1991, and has since recorded six studio albums: ''[[Moja bogda sna]]'' in 1993, ''[[Fotografija]]'' in 1995, ''[[Sredinom]]'' in 2000, ''[[Burek (album)|Burek]]'' in 2004, ''[[Ispočetka]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Hotel Nacional (album)|Hotel Nacional]]'' in 2014.

During the [[Bosnian War]], several members of the band "Merlin" were killed in the attacks, including their long-time manager Kemal Bisić with whom Dino was particularly close. Dino suffered a period of depression during which he contemplated abandoning music altogether.<ref>[https://www.blic.rs/zabava/vesti/tajne-koje-stoje-iza-najvecih-merlinovih-hitova/x7dhhfy "Tajne koje stoje iza najvećih Merlinovih hitova"].</ref>

As Dino was the sole songwriter for the band, and produced most of their work, it was no surprise that he went on a solo career. Not long after the band dissolved, Merlin was invited by the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian state government]] to write its first ever national anthem "[[Jedna si jedina]]". The song acted as the state's national anthem until the late 1990s.<ref>http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&link=141190  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007133903/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&link=141190 |date=October 7, 2015 }}</ref>
In 1993 he wrote the song and eventually participated in Bosnia's first Eurovision Song Contests, in Millstreet in [[Eurovision 1993|1993]].<ref name="novi.ba">[https://novi.ba/clanak/13121/domace-pjesme-s-eurovizije-koje-cemo-zauvijek-pamtiti "Domaće pjesme s Eurovizije koje ćemo zauvijek pamtiti!"].</ref> Dino authored the song "[[Sva bol svijeta]]" (trans. "All the grief in the world"). The song was about the hardships the people in his home country were enduring during the war and called for peace. He again participated in the Eurovision Song Contests in Jerusalem in [[Eurovision 1999|1999]] (singing ''[[Putnici]]'' with [[Béatrice Poulot|Béatrice]], a French singer) and in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]] with [[Love in Rewind]].<ref name="novi.ba" /> Dino Merlin has also taken part in other big European festivals, such as Copenhagen in 1996 and Turkovision in 1997.<ref>[http://www.dnevno.rs/istorija/na-danasnji-dan/roden-dino-merlin-pevac-i-tekstopisac-iz-bih-1962-godina/ "Rođen Dino Merlin, pevač i tekstopisac iz BiH – 1962. godina | Dnevno.rs"]. ''www.dnevno.rs''.</ref>

===Breaking records, major success===
[[File:Bosnia and Herzegovina at ESC 2011.jpg|thumb|Dino performing at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011]].]]

In 2000, aged 38, Dino wrote and released his most successful album to date - the famous "Sredinom" (trans. Middle). The album was the top-selling album in Bosnia and Herzegovina and was sold in all of the former [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav republics]].<ref>[https://www.radiosarajevo.ba/metromahala/ja-mislim/dino-merlin-zvijezda-na-neodredeno-vrijeme/255930 "Dino Merlin: Zvijezda na neodređeno vrijeme"].</ref>

The album eventually turned into a classic and became the highest selling album of the region in the last 30 years. Some estimates put the album sales at about 2,000,000 - a record breaking success considering that the whole population of Yugoslavia was about 20,000,000 people.<ref name="auto">Ernad, Yashar. [http://biografije-ba.blogspot.com/2013/01/dino-merlin-edin-dervishalidovic.html "Biografije-ba: Dino Merlin (Edin Dervišhalidović)"].</ref>

The subsequent tour promoting his ''Sredinom'' album included over 200 concerts, with a spectacular record-breaking performance at the [[Asim Ferhatović Hase Stadium|Koševo Olympic Stadium]] in [[Sarajevo Canton|Sarajevo]], in front of an audience of about 80,000.<ref name="auto"/> This was the largest crowd ever to assemble on the national stadium in Bosnia's history.<ref name="auto"/> Dino subsequently performed 3 more times at this stadium and is the only artist ever to have filled this venue to capacity on 4 occasions.

===Current success, Billboard recognition===
After a 6-year hiatus, Dino returned to the stage with his eleventh album ''[[Hotel Nacional (Dino Merlin album)|Hotel Nacional]]''.<ref name="klix.ba">[https://www.klix.ba/magazin/muzika/novi-album-dine-merlina-od-danas-u-prodaji/140620126 "Novi album Dine Merlina od danas u prodaji (VIDEO)"].</ref> It was released in June 2014 and was featured in the top 10 on the [[Billboard Charts|Billboard World Albums]] list immediately upon release due to unprecedented online sales in the region.<ref>[https://www.bljesak.info/lifestyle/flash/dino-merlin-na-billboardovoj-top-listi/89298 "Dino Merlin na Billboardovoj top listi"].</ref><ref>[https://www.billboard.com/music/dino-merlin/chart-history/world-albums/song/849798 "Dino Merlin Hotel Nacional Chart History"].</ref> This is the only album from the Slavic-speaking Europe ever to be charted on the prestigious Billboard list. The album featured a star-studded line up of [[Yoad Nevo]], [[Richard Niles]], [[Husnu Senlendirici]], and many other producers that have worked for globally renowned music acts such as [[Sugababes]], [[Morcheeba]], [[Lisa Ekdahl]], [[Sophie Ellis-Bextor]] and many others.<ref name="klix.ba"/> The Hotel Nacional World Tour has had a box office success of 700,000 people that have attended concerts across 4 continents. It is the largest tour ever to have been produced by an artist from Southeast Europe.<ref>[https://avaz.ba/showbiz/muzika/369817/potpuni-trijumf-dine-merlina-u-kultnoj-dvorani-enmore-theatre-u-australiji "Potpuni trijumf Dine Merlina u kultnoj dvorani "Enmore Theatre" u Australiji"].</ref>

Towards the end of 2019, Dino posted a teaser for a new song which was to be released, titled 'Mi'. Dino released the song in October of 2019, followed by '[[Dođi (song)|Dođi]]' at the start of 2021, and then with two more songs ('Mir svim dobrim ljudima' and 'Jedan dan, jedna noć') in May. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Dino Merlin - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjWr62wxK6tO2HDL6HI96BQ|access-date=2021-07-24|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Dino resides in his hometown of Sarajevo, in the same house and street where he was born and raised, in the historic neighbourhood of [[Alifakovac]]. He has two children. His daughter, Naida, earned her bachelor's degree from [[Buckingham University]] and master's degree at [[Oxford University]].<ref>[https://zena.blic.rs/puls-poznatih/cerka-dina-merlina-nikada-se-ne-pojavljuje-u-javnosti-zavrsila-je-oksford-i-izgleda/zt0bg0p "Ćerka Dina Merlina nikada se ne pojavljuje u javnosti, završila je Oksford i izgleda OVAKO"].</ref> His son, Hamza, graduated from the [[Boğaziçi University]] in Istanbul and earned his master's degree at [[University of Westminster]] in London.<ref>Faktor.ba,.

Dino is an avid chess player, skier, art collector and book reader. He also owns a record label and concept store in the centre of Sarajevo, in the old city centre of [[Baščaršija]].

==Philanthropy==
Although Dino likes to keep his humanitarian activities private and out of public sight, it is known that he is an active donor of scholarships to underprivileged children in Bosnia and Herzegovina. He is a long-time member of the Hastor Foundation, the biggest organisation of its kind devoted to distributing scholarships to primary and high-school students in the country.<ref name="fondacijahastor.ba">{{cite web|url=https://fondacijahastor.ba/?lang=en|title=Home|website=Fondacija Hastor}}</ref> Dino acts as a sponsor to over dozen students every year and has been a member of this programme since 2008.<ref name="fondacijahastor.ba"/>

Dino worked for 5 years [[pro bono]] as the honorary and [[de facto]] president of the assembly of AMUS - the main association of music artists of Bosnia.<ref name="faktor.ba">{{cite web|url=http://www.faktor.ba/|title=faktor.ba|website=faktor.ba}}</ref> He has been one of the founding members of this organisation in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amus.ba/v3/page.php?ID=2|title=O nama &#124; Amus|date=14 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180714193408/http://www.amus.ba/v3/page.php?ID=2|archive-date=14 July 2018}}</ref> In early 2018 he resigned from his position as president due to the lack of available time at his disposal to run the association.<ref name="faktor.ba"/>

During his career he has played numerous charity concerts. During the great floods, which have affected the region, Dino's team was heavily involved in humanitarian works - distributing water, food, blankets and other provisions to the most endangered parts of Bosnia and Serbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU4inLMLtR0 |title=Dino Merlin Team u akciji |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-05-18 |accessdate=2021-02-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/vijesti/bih/dino-merlin-donirao-hranu-i-vodu-zrtvama-poplava-u-bih-i-srbiji/140521070|title=Dino Merlin donirao hranu i vodu žrtvama poplava u BiH i Srbiji|website=Klix.ba}}</ref>
