[[File:Exuma.jpg|right|frame|Exuma]]
'''Exuma''' is a [[district of the Bahamas|district of The Bahamas]], consisting of over 365 islands, also called [[cay]]s.

The largest of the cays is Great Exuma, which is 37&nbsp;mi (60&nbsp;km) in length and joined to another island, Little Exuma, by a small bridge. The capital and largest town in the district is [[George Town, Bahamas|George Town]] (population 1,437).<ref name=Stats/> It was founded 1793 and located on Great Exuma. Near the town, but on Little Exuma, the [[Tropic of Cancer]] runs across Pelican Beach lending it another name: Tropic of Cancer Beach. Its white sand and turquoise waters make it a world-famous destination. The entire island chain is 130&nbsp;mi (209&nbsp;km) long and 72 sq mi (187&nbsp;km²) in area.<ref name="tamug">{{citation | url = http://www.tamug.edu/cavebiology/Bahamas/Exumacays.html| title = Exuma Cays | publisher = Texas A&M University | access-date = October 11, 2013 }}</ref><ref name="exuma">{{citation | url = http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/portal/public/About%20The%20Bahamas/The%20Islands/EXUMA/!ut/p/b1/vZLLcqMwEEW_JR9AkDDPpcxDBsz7YWBDYeNgIGDGYIz19ePMbDJTlWQzGWmlqqO-fW83ndEJnfXFXFfFVJ_74vXtnfH5CmALIVa0MAd4oEfuFrnChnEgR-_oJEwZSRn1CqvxyxBNG_Qj1rJiwU3kNudzP6Vzw23X9dqflF6j5rq0cmM-9Bpa-CiE1v0qS0YpLaUtqr1otq19fQk9vgirnf6ymvrDyl2IKVoXrcy13ak5-S6xlVw9zRZ_n7O7oF2PSZDeK728-IQvxqWBWbDZN1pkwdTzYKOgltL0ut16MtPV10JflfzEUcgY5YFFTw-T6cMk-OAg8FUGv_9_BLDg6wyzT5G3Cr-Az1r8tILJ0OkDEN4BYQyADgHyA-gB0YZ0SCeAzYPmPuikJX5DvFtADHskHoBhxFhK4tmhCi07tifFd0ELbasxLDs0jDG6Mda0d8vYj9YILSd_0v8WdJhQegjKkDcjDgSA_W5BzDniIwIhdBHHAOzA_y24-q-RYtcB3-7wj6VhvX8_Q4PO6n33fDt0z-BZlHjICSIriTxgWVGg4yZlBVk0kKqHeTCcLyTmJg3EmmVX5x6_ti23HFhNOOx9gTqKVCuXp5QcyPWmHCrWxHpuZMsylgvZzgWnA9KoEmbEmlV47nVWY_nYz8bRscYgmjyyS2tVvyeQssks3TKB07HJOYKZdeXKkIMulC6JFFwHiuwZU5OrFR563sYMn91U93iv3Bw3e9NJxs6DfZvImySYp6xkCa7qeM0Z22QQrOuacrC822jrrXaTEv3srtFwLaunJ9renLsjPXSzueX9DUne3SN6-gl_4DkO/dl4/d5/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/| title = Exuma | publisher = The Government of The Bahamas }}</ref> Great Exuma island has an area of 61 sq mi (158&nbsp;km²) while Little Exuma has an area of 11 sq mi (29&nbsp;km²).<ref name="brit">{{citation | url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/199226/Exuma-Cays#ref65624| title = Exuma Cays | publisher = britannica | access-date = October 11, 2013 }}</ref>

Between 2000 and 2010, the population of Exuma more than doubled, reflecting the construction of large and small resort properties and the related direct air traffic to Great Exuma from locations as distant as [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. The population in 2010 was 6,928.<ref name=Stats>[http://www.bahamas.gov.bs/wps/wcm/connect/5cd773c4-d1ac-48c6-a6c3-9057a8938849/EXUMA+AND+CAYS+POPULATION+BY+SETTLEMENT_2010+CENSUS.pdf?MOD=AJPERES EXUMA AND CAYS POPULATION BY SETTLEMENT AND TOTAL NUMBER OF OCCUPIED DWELLINGS: 2010 CENSUS] - Bahamas Department of Statistics</ref>

== History ==
Exuma was settled in or around 1783 by [[United States|American]] colonial [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|loyalist]]s fleeing the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. The expatriates brought a [[cotton]] [[plantation]] economy to the islands. George Town was named in honour of [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]], to whom the settlers maintained their loyalty. A few smaller cays still remain partially or wholly privately owned, albeit they are still referred to as part of the Exuma–Bahamas Cays; they are distinguished by a three-digit suffix number. The best known examples are adjoined cays Exuma 642 and 643, which are suffering from [[Beach evolution|receding shorelines]].

[[John Rolle, 1st Baron Rolle]], a Loyalist settler of the Exumas, is a major figure in the islands' heritage. Upon his death in 1842, he bestowed all of his significant Exuma land holdings to his [[Slavery in Britain|slaves]]. As a result,   towns on Great Exuma such as Rolleville and Rolletown were named after him.

The islands are a popular spot for [[yachting]], [[sailing]], [[Underwater diving|diving]], and [[coral reef]] and [[Cave exploration|cave exploring]].<ref>{{citation | url = http://www.bahamas.com/islands/exumas| title = Discover more about The Exumas | publisher = Bahamas.com | access-date = October 11, 2013 }}</ref> Many of the unnamed beaches and coves of the islands, including extensive offshore reef areas, are included in the protected Exuma National Land and Sea Park or the Moriah Harbour Cay National Park of the [[Bahamas National Trust]]. Some of the islands on which there are permanent residents and resorts include Great Exuma, Little Exuma, Stocking Island, [[Staniel Cay]] (home of the Staniel Cay Yacht Club, a fixture in the Exumas), Fowl Cay, [[Musha Cay]] and Iguana Cay.<ref>{{citation | url = http://the-bahamas.net/attractions-and-activities/best-beaches-on-exuma-bahamas/| title = Beaches on Exuma Bahamas | publisher = The Bahamas.  | access-date = October 11, 2013 }}</ref> Thunderball Grotto, located just a few hundred yards off Staniel Cay, is one location where the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' was filmed. Sandy Cay, just a short boat ride from Little Exuma was the location used for filming the ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean]]'' beach scenes and a Shell commercial.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The novel ''[[Wind from the Carolinas]]'' was set in Great Exuma.<ref>Wilder, Robert. ''Wind From the Carolinas''. New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1964. Back panel.</ref>

The Exumas are the historic home of the [[Lucayan people|Lucayan Natives]], who were wholly enslaved in the 16th century, leaving the islands uninhabited until the 18th century. In the intervening period, the Exumas provided many hideouts and stashes for [[Piracy in the Caribbean|pirates]]. Elizabeth Harbour was allegedly a favorite lair of [[Captain Kidd]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Steve|first=Bennett|title=St. Andrew’s Anglican Church Exuma: Historic Georgetown|url=https://www.uncommoncaribbean.com/exuma/st-andrews-anglican-church-exuma/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2017, it was the site of the [[Fyre Festival]], a luxury music festival which became notorious online and in the media for its shambolic organization, and the numerous lawsuits that followed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/73332-fyre-threatened-to-sue-twitter-critics-for-potentially-inciting-riots-sixth-lawsuit-claims/|title=Fyre Threatened to Sue Twitter Critics for Potentially Inciting Riots, Sixth Lawsuit Claims|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|first=Marc|last=Hogan|date=May 8, 2017|access-date=May 8, 2017}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[Exuma International Airport]] serves the city of George Town directly from [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], [[Miami]], [[Atlanta]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], [[Charlotte]], and [[Toronto]]. [[Staniel Cay]] also has a small airstrip commercially served by charter or scheduled charter airlines. A number of other cays have small airstrips, both private and public. Boat travel from Nassau to the Northern Exuma Cays is approximately one hour.

Local transportation may consist of taxis, rental vehicle or golf cart depending on the cay.

==Food==
[[File:exuma_local_foods.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Preparing dinner from fresh caught fish.|Preparing for dinner]] The Exumas are known for fresh food and cultural significance to [[The Bahamas]]. Sea life regularly caught for commercial purpose include [[barracuda]], [[bonefish]], [[conch]], [[grouper]], [[Carangidae|jack]], [[lobster]], [[marlin]], [[sailfish]], [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], [[tarpon]], [[tuna]] and [[wahoo]].

Exumian food is often similar or a slight variation of traditional Bahamian dishes.

The George Town Fish Fry is a collection of businesses, some of which are only open at night serving a variety of cuisine. It is popular among local residents and tourists alike.

==Economy==
[[File:Exuma tourism.jpg|thumb|alt=[[Tourism]] is crucial to the economy of the cays.|[[Tourism]] is crucial to the economy of the cays.]]The capital, [[George Town, Bahamas|George Town]], is home to government offices, shops and services that serve both the traveling public and residents of the islands. As of 2020 there were 2 banks, a police station, 2 grocery stores, 3 liquor stores, a gas station and 1 hotel within the town proper although there are a few other businesses nearby that are typically associated as being in George Town due to proximity.

There are a number of restaurants throughout Exuma, the majority of which serve variations of local cuisine, and a some that serve other cuisines such as [[Italian cuisine|Italian]].

=== Fishing ===
Fishing is a part of both the local and tourism economies of Exuma. Visitors may fish on their own, hire a fishing guide or charter for sport while the local fishing economy primarily supports the local population's food supply. Locals can be often seen fishing from shore and bridges presumably for their own food, often using a [[Handline fishing|hand line]].

Known as the "Grey Ghost", [[bonefish]] can be found in the flats areas covered by as little as one foot of water, or less.  Their fair colouration is perfectly adapted as camouflage against the sandy ocean bottom, making the fish difficult to spot in spite of the clear Bahamian waters. [[Angling|Anglers]] may employ spin casting equipment, but more often opt for fly-fishing in their hunt for bonefish.<ref>Exuma Bonefish Guides, Exuma's Bonefish Guide Listing{{full citation needed|date=May 2016}}</ref> Other flats fish targets may include [[Permit (fish)|permit]] and [[tarpon]].

Fishing in Exuma is primarily separated into two broad regions, the shallower southern or western side and the deep water of [[Exuma Sound]], although some inshore fishing grounds exist such as in Moriah Harbour National Park. These areas are habitat for other types of fish including various [[Lutjanidae|snapper]], [[Haemulidae|grunts]], [[Carangidae|jacks]], [[grouper]] are possible to be caught throughout the fishing areas in Exuma while [[Pelagic fish|pelagic]] species like [[wahoo]], [[mahi-mahi]], [[barracuda]], [[marlin]], [[tuna]], [[sailfish]] and more<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fish The Exumas|url=https://www.bahamas.com/islandinterestdetail/fish-exumas|website=The Official Site of The Bahamas|access-date=2019-06-05}}</ref> are primarily caught in Exuma Sound.

=== Tourism ===
The islands have built a reputation as a luxury travel destination.

=== Telecommunication ===
The telephone area code for the island is 242, which is the same as the rest of the Bahamas. There are 2 main telecommunication providers that cover most of the Exuma cays, [[Aliv]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aliv now over 170,000 customers, with 37 per cent estimated revenue share|url=https://ewnews.com/aliv-now-over-170000-customers-with-37-per-cent-estimated-revenue-share|date=2019-11-12|website=EyeWitness News|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> and [[BTC (Bahamas)|BTC Bahamas]].

[[Internet access|High-speed internet]] is available from both providers with varying technologies such as DSL, cellular and fiber optic cable becoming available.<ref>{{Cite web|title=BTC touts doubling of internet speeds|url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2019/may/03/btc-touts-doubling-internet-speeds/|website=www.tribune242.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref>

==Culture==
The annual Bahamian Music and Heritage Festival, Regattas, Junkanoo and various "homecoming" events held in smaller settlements are highly anticipated in The Exumas by tourists and islanders alike. These festivals may focus on the food, sailing competition, arts, and music of the local culture.

==Media==
Because the population is so tiny, there is a small traditional [[mass media|media]] industry. The Bahamas is served by many newspapers, radio stations and web sites, whereas the local media in George Town consists of [The Blaze 98.3 FM.)
''The Chain'' is a free newspaper published monthly and is the 'one source for current and accurate information' on the chain of islands.<ref>The Chain, September 2015, Page 1</ref>

{{See also|List of residents of the Bahamas}}
The main island has been a haven for celebrities for years. Until recently, the tourist population on the island was extremely minimal, allowing anonymity for anyone escaping the spotlight. Frequent visitors included [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]], who stayed at the [[Goat Cay, Exuma|Goat Cay]] home of Babbie Holt, [[Jackie Onassis]], [[Jessica Tandy]] and [[Hume Cronyn]], and [[Sigourney Weaver]], who vacationed there with her family.<ref>[https://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&linkCode=qs&keywords=9781782221081 Richmonds of the World] Richmonds of the World, p.130, Retrieved 28 April 2017</ref> More recently the islands have become the home of [[John McAfee]], founder of [[McAfee|McAfee Software]], who conducted his brief [[John McAfee 2020 presidential campaign|2020 presidential campaign]] from a boat moored in the harbour.

== Notable homeowners ==
The Bahamian tax structure may be an advantage for some with the desire to establish residency, while others may purchase homes for private use or investment. Some have purchased [[private island]]s, while others have purchased more common homes. A number of well known people own islands or residences in the Exumas. These include [[Aga Khan]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]], [[Ali Daei]], [[Johnny Depp]],<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2009/07/johnny-depp200907|title=Johnny Depp's Great Escape|last=Brinkley|first=Douglas|author-link=Douglas Brinkley|date=July 2009|magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|access-date= 2010-01-04}}</ref> [[Faith Hill]] and [[Tim McGraw]], [[Ali Karimi]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Eddie Irvine]], [[Tyler Perry]] and [[Jena Sims]].
