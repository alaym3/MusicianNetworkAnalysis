==Biography==
An ethnic [[Volga Tatars|Volga Tatar]], she was born in a typical middle-class family – her mother is a doctor, and her father is a history teacher.  At the age of 4, Zemfira became interested in music and entered a music school the following year (where she studied piano performance and voice) and writing her first song when she was seven years old.  Her older brother Ramil introduced her to rock music, which became her real passion – she listened to [[Black Sabbath]], [[Nazareth (band)|Nazareth]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], learning to play the guitar.  In the 7th grade, Zemfira split her time between music and basketball, becoming the captain of the Russian Girls’ Junior Basketball Team by 1990.  She began to lose interest in classical music, preferring instead to hang out with friends in the streets of [[Ufa]] and covering songs by Russian rock groups such as [[Kino (rock group)|Kino]], [[Nautilus Pompilius (band)|Nautilus Pompilius]] and [[Aquarium (group)|Aquarium]] (who reached the peak of their popularity in the early 1990s).

At the urging of her mother, Zemfira continued with piano studies and graduated music school with honors.  In her last year of high school, basketball competed with school work, and the singer abandoned the sport in favour of music.  She took the entrance exams for the Ufa College of Fine Arts<ref>[http://www.bashedu.ru/encikl/u/uch_issk.htm УЧИЛИЩЕ ИСКУССТВ, Уфимское (УУИ)]. bashedu.ru  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620010314/http://www.bashedu.ru/encikl/u/uch_issk.htm|date=20 June 2006}}</ref> and was admitted into the second year, studying vocal performance.  During college, she performed [[jazz]] and [[rock and roll]] standards in various local bars and restaurants accompanied by her friend, saxophone player Vlad Kolchin.  She graduated with honors, and in 1996 took a job as a sound engineer at the Ufa subsidiary of the radio station "Europe Plus".

For the next couple of years Zemfira spent her days making advertisement recordings at the station and her nights on a computer, where she recorded the songs that would later become the singles "Why" (Почему), "Snow" (Снег), and "Weatherman" (Синоптик).  In early 1998, Zemfira invited Rinat Akhmadiyev, Sergei Sozinov, Sergei Mirolyubov, and Vadim Solovyov to join Zemfira.  Their first professional gig took place on 19 June 1999 as part of a festival celebrating the anniversary of a local radio station Silver Rain Ufa.  Shortly after Zemfira sent out promo tapes to multiple Moscow producers, one of whom ([[Ilia Lagutenko|Ilya Lagutenko]] from [[Mumiy Troll]]) was smitten with the material, and invited the band for some sessions in Moscow.

==Career==

===1999–2005===
Recording and production work on the debut album took place at Mosfilm Moscow until 10 May 1999, when the debut was finally released.  The promotion of ''Zemfira''  prior to the release included heavy rotation of singles "AIDS" (СПИД), "Arrivederci" (Aриведерчи), and "Rockets" (Ракеты) as well as the video clips for those songs.  The band immediately went on tour, starting a tradition of celebrating their beginnings with a summer concert in Ufa while recording their second album ''[[Forgive Me My Love]]'' (Прости Меня Моя Любовь).  The group enjoyed popularity from the start, in part because of heavy rotation on radio and television, and in part because a female rocker is a fairly rare and unusual concept for the Russian music scene (which to this day is dominated by scantily-clad female pop singers).

After the release of ''PMML'' (Russian abbreviation for ''Forgive Me My Love'') in March 2000, what can only be described as “Zemfiromania” swept the country.  "Searching" (Искала) and "Ripe" (Созрела) became instant hits, and the group was invited to headline the festival [[Maxidrom]].  Constant touring wore down on the band, and after the release of ''[[14 Weeks of Silence]]'' the band took a break.

In September 2004, Zemfira began studies towards a degree in Philosophy at [[Moscow State University]], but after the first semester she took a sabbatical and did not resume her studies thereafter. On 16 October on the MTV Russia Awards show the singer performed "[[We Are the Champions]]"  together with the rock group [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rol.ru/news/art/music/04/10/18_001.htm |script-title=ru:Сервисы РОЛ |language=ru |publisher=Rol.ru |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

The fourth studio album, ''[[Vendetta (Zemfira album)|Vendetta]]'', which consists of 15 tracks, was released on 1 March 2005. The recording became a result of Zemfira's collaboration with several musicians: [[:ru:Игорь Вдовин|Igor Vdovin]], [[:ru:Корниенко, Владимир Витальевич|Korney]], Vlad Kreymer, [[Yuri Tsaler]] and [[Oleg Pungin]]. Primarily the album was going to be named "Oil", but the title was changed few days before the official release.<ref>[http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/argentum/34829/ ЗЕМФИРА]. echo.msk.ru (6 March 2005)  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080412221742/http://www.echo.msk.ru/programs/argentum/34829/|date=12 April 2008}}</ref> "Vendetta" got many positive reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/553282 |title=Ъ-Газета – Диски |publisher=Kommersant.ru |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mk.ru/editions/daily/article/2005/03/02/199220-zemfira-vendetta.html |title=Земфира.

===2007–present===
On 14 February 2007, a collection of music videos ''Zemfira.DVD'' was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.ru/articles/128 |title=Земфира теперь на DVD.

In May and June 2007, Zemfira embarked on a short concert tour titled 'Déjà Vu', with performances held in smaller venues (clubs and small theatres).  The tour culminated with a Moscow performance at the Green Theatre which was filmed by [[Renata Litvinova]].  The tour program focused on stylish remakes of the singer's top hits, often reworked in styles such as [[jazz]], [[ska]], [[bossa nova]], and [[blues]]. A new album, ''Thank You'' (Спасибо), was released at the beginning of October. It is described by Zemfira herself as 'very positive', in contrast to what she terms the 'restlessness' of ''Vendetta''.<ref name="Zemfira's official website">[http://www.zemfira.ru/index.php] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070815101303/http://www.zemfira.ru/index.php|date=15 August 2007}}</ref>

The concert movie ''Green Theatre in Zemfira'', which mixes Zemfira's monologues with selected songs shot during her live performance at the open air show in Moscow, was released in several Russian digital movie theatres on 21 February 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cultradio.ru/doc.html?id=166192&cid=44 |title=Портрет Земфиры на пленке |publisher=Cultradio.ru |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> Later it was also released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gay.ru/news/rainbow/2008/03/16-12536.htm |title=Фильм "Зеленый театр в Земфире" выйдет на Dvd и в формате Blue Ray |publisher=GAY.RU |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

The final concert in support of ''Thank You'' was staged on 1 April 2008 at the [[Olympic Stadium (Moscow arena)|Olimpiysky stadium]] in Moscow; some journalists considered it as the best performance in her career.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lenta.ru/articles/2008/04/02/zemfira/ |title=Олимпийский в Земфире |publisher=Lenta.ru |date=2 April 2008 |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> Later in June Zemfira was awarded an independent [[:ru:Степной волк (премия)|Steppenwolf]] prize established by a musical critic [[Artemy Troitsky]]. She won in two categories: The Best Performance (for the Olimpiysky show) and The Best Album (''Thank You''). The movie-concert ''Green Theatre in Zemfira'' by Litvinova was named the best musical movie of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/cinema/16jun2008/volk.html |title=Новости NEWSru.com :: В Москве прошла церемония вручения премий за музыкальную "неформатность" |publisher=Newsru.com |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

On 21 March 2009, an album of b-sides ''Z-Sides'' leaked into the net.<ref name="auto"/>

In June 2010, Zemfira wrote on her official website: "vacation is over" and announced a mini-tour in support of a deluxe-edition of her first three albums (''Zemfira'', ''PMML'' and ''14 Weeks of Silence'').<ref name="Zemfira's official website" /> On 1 August she performed a set of 4 songs on the closing concert of a pop-music contest [[New Wave (competition)|New Wave]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Lapteva, Elena and Remizova, Maria |url=http://www.kp.ru/daily/24532.5/677250/ |title=Земфира навсегда |publisher=Kp.ru |date=19 September 2010 |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> It was her first performance since January 2009. The arrangements of this set were used in the mini-tour in September that included 5 cities: [[Saint-Petersburg]], [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Minsk]], [[Kyiv]] and Moscow. Critics admitted that her old songs became more rhythmic and resembled demo-versions due to the new minimalistic style of arrangements.<ref>{{cite web|author=Petrunin, Anton|url=http://www.zvuki.ru/R/P/23560 |title=ЗЕМФИРА Между прочим, лучше всех |publisher=Zvuki.ru |date= 7 September 2010|access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> In October Zemfira took part in two tribute concerts "20 Years without KINO" in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg that were dedicated to the memory of [[Viktor Tsoi]]. Her gig of four covers on Tsoi's songs was seen by some journalists as the most noticeable performance in the program.<ref>{{cite web|author=Kashapov, Radif |date=11 October 2010|url=http://www.zvuki.ru/R/P/23816/ |title=КОНЦЕРТ Попробуй спеть, как Виктор Цой|publisher=Zvuki.ru |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc-y/1519935 |title=Общественно значимое "Кино"|publisher=Kommersant.ru |date=13 October 2010 |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

On New Year's Eve 2011, the video version of two Moscow concerts staged in [[Crocus City Hall]] and Strelka Institute in September 2010 was broadcast on [[:ru:Дождь (телеканал)|Dozhd' (Rain) TV channel]]. The video was directed by Renata Litvinova.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/Doc-y/1552369 |title=Ъ-Деньги – Полный ящик "огоньков" |publisher=Kommersant.ru |date= 20 December 2010|author=Borovoi, Vladimir|access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> Then the singer informed her fans that the release of her sixth album had moved to Fall 2011.<ref name="Zemfira's official website"/> The first single [[:ru:Без шансов|''No Chance'' (Bez shansov)]] was presented on [[Nashe Radio]] on 15 April. During the next three months she gave three performances: on 28 May Zemfira took part in the international rock festival [[Maxidrom]] along with [[The Prodigy]], [[Adam Lambert]], [[Korn]], [[Brainstorm (Latvian band)|Brainstorm]] and other artists;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmusic.ru/news_3_22862.htm |title=Maxidrom: Мизантропичная Земфира и все-все-все Maxidrom Новости шоу-бизнеса |publisher=Newsmusic.ru |date=30 May 2011 |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> then she became a Russian headliner of a ''Muz-TV Awards'' ceremony show at Olimpiysky stadium on 3 June;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.ru/society/news.asp?id=189435 |title=Земфира станет хедлайнером премии МУЗ-ТВ |date=11 May 2011|publisher=Interfax.ru |access-date=15 November 2012}}</ref> on 23 July Zemfira performed at the [[Afisha Picnic]] outdoor festival in Moscow as the Russian headliner of the main stage.

She offended some audience members by comparing Kyiv to Moscow, in that she had to work hard, rather than Odessa and St Petersburg where the crowd do the work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kp.ua/daily/120413/389097/|title=Земфира немножко обиделась на Киев|website=Kp.ua|access-date=14 December 2017|author=Katsun, Yulia |date=12 April 2013}}</ref>

In July 2015, Zemfira unfurled Ukraine's national flag at a [[Tbilisi Open Air|concert]] in the Georgian capital of [[Tbilisi]], drawing criticism from Russian media, while several promoters in Russia abandoned their plans to include her in their programs.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Nechepurenko|first1=Ivan|title=Promoters Drop Russian Rock Star for Waving Ukrainian Flag on Stage|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/promoters-drop-russian-rock-star-for-waving-ukrainian-flag-on-stage/525161.html|access-date=7 July 2015|work=The Moscow Times|date=6 July 2015}}</ref> However, in 2016, in a concert in Lithuania, Zemfira demanded the audience to remove a huge Ukrainian flag that was unfolded by fans.

Whilst you love your country, I love mine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/world/20160322/1394406977.html|title=Земфира на концерте в грубой форме потребовала убрать флаг Украины|date=22 March 2016|website=Ria.ru|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://apostrophe.com.ua/news/society/culture/2016-03-21/zemfira-gryazno-vyirugalas-na-ukrainskiy-flag-opublikovano-video/53153|title=Земфира грязно выругалась на украинский флаг: опубликовано видео|date=21 March 2016|website=Apostrophe.com.ua|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref>

In February 2016 during her "Little Man" (Маленький человек) tour Zemfira announced that she would stop touring, which was misrepresented in the media as her abandoning musical performance altogether.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://slon.ru/posts/74283|title=Незаметный уход|last=Arkhangelsky|first=Andrey|date=1 October 2016|publisher=SLON|language=ru|access-date=3 October 2016}}</ref> Musical critic Troitsky commented that while he does not doubt that the announcement was made in earnest, he believed that since Zemfira is an emotional person, she may change her decision later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ria.ru/culture/20160219/1377217857.html|title=Троицкий: решение Земфиры прекратить гастроли может быть не окончательным|date=19 February 2016|website=Ria.ru|access-date=14 December 2017}}</ref> {{as of|November 2016}} the "Little Man" tour continues in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zemfira.ru/|title=Zemfira – Официальный сайт|website=Zemfira.ru|access-date=14 December 2017}}
