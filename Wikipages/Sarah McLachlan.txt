'''Sarah Ann McLachlan''' (born January 28, 1968) is a Canadian singer-songwriter. As of 2015, she had sold over 40 million albums worldwide.<ref name=mommusic /> McLachlan's best-selling album to date is ''[[Surfacing (album)|Surfacing]]'', for which she won two [[Grammy Award]]s (out of four nominations) and four [[Juno Award]]s. In addition to her personal artistic efforts, she founded the [[Lilith Fair]] tour, which showcased women musicians.

==Early and personal life==
McLachlan was born on January 28, 1968, in [[Halifax, Nova Scotia]], Canada.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=824}}</ref> She was placed with the McLachlan family, which later legally [[adoption|adopted]] her.

As a child, she was a member of [[Girl Guides of Canada]], participating in Guiding programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cambridgetimes.ca/opinion-story/6155448-celine-dion-margaret-atwood-among-long-list-of-girl-guides/|title=Opinion {{!}} Celine Dion, Margaret Atwood among long list of Girl Guides|date=2015-12-02|website=CambridgeTimes.ca|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-04-23|archive-date=February 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160229003854/http://www.cambridgetimes.ca/opinion-story/6155448-celine-dion-margaret-atwood-among-long-list-of-girl-guides/|url-status=live}}</ref>

She played music from a very young age, beginning with the [[ukulele]] when she was four. She studied classical guitar, classical piano, and voice<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sarah-mclachlan-emc |encyclopedia= Canadian Encyclopedia |title= Sarah McLachlan |access-date= April 5, 2018 |archive-date= January 15, 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180115020627/http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sarah-mclachlan-emc/ |url-status= live }}</ref> at the [[Maritime Conservatory of Music]]<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.solaced.info/about/bio/|website=Solaced.info|title=Sarah's Biography/Discography}}</ref> through the curriculum of [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sarah McLachlan on recording her third album in 1993|work=cbc.ca|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/sarah-mclachlan-on-recording-her-third-album-in-1993|access-date=April 5, 2018|date=March 26, 1993|archive-date=March 27, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180327095556/http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/sarah-mclachlan-on-recording-her-third-album-in-1993|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title= Mentor Memories with singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan| work= rcmusic.com| url= https://www.rcmusic.com/sites/default/files/files/MusicMatters-Spring2012.pdf| access-date= April 5, 2018| archive-date= January 28, 2019| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190128135542/https://www.rcmusic.com/sites/default/files/files/MusicMatters-Spring2012.pdf| url-status= live}}</ref> At 17, while she was still a student at [[Queen Elizabeth High School (Halifax, Nova Scotia)|Queen Elizabeth High School]], in Halifax, she fronted a short-lived rock band called The October Game. One of the band's songs, "Grind", credited as a group composition, can be found on the independent Flamingo Records release ''Out of the Fog'' and the CD ''Out of the Fog Too''. It has yet to be released elsewhere.

Following The October Game's first concert at [[Dalhousie University]] opening for [[Moev]], McLachlan was offered a recording contract with Vancouver-based independent record label [[Nettwerk]] by Moev's [[Mark Jowett]]. McLachlan's parents insisted that she finish high school and complete one year of studies at the [[Nova Scotia College of Art and Design]] before moving to Vancouver and embarking on a new life as a recording artist. She finally signed to Nettwerk two years later before having written a single song. When she was 19, a mutual acquaintance introduced her to her birth mother. McLachlan did not seek her out and was ambivalent about meeting her.<ref name="auto"/>

In 1994, McLachlan was sued by Uwe Vandrei, an obsessed fan from [[Ottawa]], who alleged that his letters to her had been the basis of the single "[[Possession (Sarah McLachlan song)|Possession]]". The lawsuit was also challenging for the Canadian legal system since Vandrei was an admitted [[stalking|stalker]] whose acknowledged goal in filing the lawsuit was to be near McLachlan. Consequently, precautions were taken to ensure McLachlan's safety if she had to be in the same location as Vandrei. Before the trial began, however, Vandrei was found dead in an apparent [[suicide]]. Vandrei's preoccupation with McLachlan was explored at length in Canadian author [[Judith Fitzgerald]]'s book, ''Building a Mystery: The Story of Sarah McLachlan & Lilith Fair''.

In 1997, McLachlan married her drummer, [[Ashwin Sood]], in [[Jamaica]]. While she was pregnant with her first child, her mother died from [[cancer]] in December 2001. While working on her next album, ''[[Afterglow (Sarah McLachlan album)|Afterglow]]'', she gave birth to a daughter in Vancouver on April 6, 2002. On June 22, 2007, she gave birth to her second daughter, also in Vancouver. McLachlan announced her separation from Ashwin Sood in September 2008<ref name=billboard /> and they divorced the same year.<ref name="usma_Sara">{{Cite web | title = Sarah McLachlan Opens Up About "Devastating" Divorce | work = Us Weekly | date = 27 May 2011 | access-date = 2017-12-10 | url = https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sarah-mclachlan-opens-up-about-devastating-divorce-2011275/ }}</ref>

==Career and albums==

=== 1987–92: ''Touch'' and ''Solace'' ===
The signing with Nettwerk prompted McLachlan to move to [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]]. There she recorded her first album, ''[[Touch (Sarah McLachlan album)|Touch]]'', in 1987, which received both critical and commercial success and included the song "Vox". During this period she also contributed to an album by [[Moev]], provided vocals on Manufacture's "As the End Draws Near", and embarked on her first national concert tour as an opening act for [[The Grapes of Wrath (band)|The Grapes of Wrath]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/nme-video/youtube/id/KA2DNtkkLzg/search/manufacture-with-sarah-mclachlan|title=Moev ft.

Her 1991 album, ''[[Solace (Sarah McLachlan album)|Solace]]'', was her mainstream breakthrough in Canada, spawning the hit singles "[[The Path of Thorns (Terms)]]" and "[[Into the Fire (Sarah McLachlan song)|Into the Fire]]". ''Solace'' also marked the beginning of her partnership with [[Pierre Marchand]]. Marchand and McLachlan have been collaborators ever since, with Marchand producing many of McLachlan's albums and occasionally co-writing songs.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar00/articles/pmarchland.htm|magazine=[[Sound on Sound]]|access-date=March 4, 2012|date=March 2000|author=Paul Tingen|title=Pierre Marchand: Producing Sarah McLachlan|archive-date=January 10, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110082517/http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/mar00/articles/pmarchland.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 1993–2000: ''Fumbling Towards Ecstasy'', ''Surfacing'', and ''Mirrorball'' ===
[[File:Sarah McLachlan 1993 Calyoquot.jpg|thumb|right|McLachlan at a 1993 benefit for [[Clayoquot Sound]]]]
1993's ''[[Fumbling Towards Ecstasy]]'' was an immediate hit in Canada.<ref name="Larkin"/> From her [[Nettwerk]] connection, her piano version of the song "[[Possession (Sarah McLachlan song)|Possession]]" was included on the first ''[[Due South]]'' [[Due South: The Original Television Soundtrack|soundtrack]] in 1996. Over the next two years, ''Fumbling Towards Ecstasy'' became McLachlan's international breakthrough as well, scaling the charts in a number of countries.<ref name="Inc.1994">{{cite magazine|author=Larry LeBlanc|title=A Breakthrough Year for Canadian Acts|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|date=December 24, 1994|page=53|issn=0006-2510|access-date=December 14, 2016|archive-date=June 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200630232843/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following the success from ''Fumbling Towards Ecstasy'', McLachlan returned in 1997 with ''[[Surfacing (album)|Surfacing]]'', her best-selling and best-known album to date. The album earned her two 1998 [[Grammy Awards]], one for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] (for "[[Building a Mystery]]") and one for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Performance]] (for "[[Last Dance (Sarah McLachlan song)|Last Dance]]"), and four [[Juno Award]]s, including Album of the Year for ''Surfacing'' and Song of the Year and Songwriter of the Year for "Building a Mystery". Reaching number one on the [[Canadian Albums Chart]] and number two on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the album has since sold over 16 million copies worldwide and brought her much international success. Still in the spotlight from the album, McLachlan launched the highly popular [[Lilith Fair]] tour. Her song "[[Angel (Sarah McLachlan song)|Angel]]"—inspired by the fatal [[overdose]] of [[Smashing Pumpkins]] touring keyboardist [[Jonathan Melvoin]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Quora Answer by Sarah McLachlan |url=https://www.quora.com/What-was-the-inspiration-behind-Sarah-McLachlans-song-Angel/answer/Sarah-McLachlan-2?ch=10&share=ea69ac78&srid=kl9 |website=Quora |access-date=14 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.funtrivia.com/en/music/drugs-in-songs-17801.html|title=Drugs in Songs|publisher=Fun Trivia|access-date=22 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307233608/http://www.funtrivia.com/en/Music/Drugs-in-Songs-17801.html|archive-date=7 March 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>—made sales skyrocket. One of the songs from ''Surfacing,'' "Full of Grace," features in the Season 2 finale of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Becoming (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|"Becoming (Part II)"]].

Fellow adoptee [[Darryl McDaniels]] was so touched by "Angel" that it inspired him to reassess his life and career. He credits McLachlan and her album, ''Surfacing'', (on which "Angel" appeared) with saving his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/691/691277p1.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2008-08-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025104607/http://music.ign.com/articles/691/691277p1.html |archive-date=October 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> They collaborated on many projects in support of Adoptee Rights.<ref>{{youtube|id=CRtae4jTF4A}}</ref>

In 1999, McLachlan released a live album, ''[[Mirrorball (Sarah McLachlan album)|Mirrorball]]''. The album's singles included a new live version of her earlier song, "I Will Remember You", a studio recording of which had previously been released on ''[[The Brothers McMullen]]'' soundtrack as well as ''[[Rarities, B-Sides and Other Stuff]]''. The song was released as a single twice, once in 1995 where it peaked No. 65 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada, and again in 1999 at No. 14 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 10 in Canada. The 1999 version garnered McLachlan her third [[Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] (for "[[I Will Remember You (Sarah McLachlan song)|I Will Remember You]]") in 2000.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

In 1998, the motion picture ''[[City of Angels (film)|City of Angels]]'' featured "Angel". The [[City of Angels: Music from the Motion Picture|soundtrack]] reached number one on the ''Billboard'' chart. More than five months after the film disappeared from the theatres, the soundtrack remained firmly entrenched among ''Billboard''{{'}}s top 40 albums and earned quadruple-platinum status.<ref name=NYT />

In 1999, McLachlan recorded the [[Randy Newman]] song "[[When She Loved Me]]" on the ''[[Toy Story 2]]'' soundtrack. This song was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] in [[72nd Academy Awards|2000]], and McLachlan performed it at the awards ceremony, but the award went to "[[You'll Be in My Heart]]" from ''[[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]]'', written and recorded by [[Phil Collins]].{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

=== 2003–05: ''Afterglow'' ===
McLachlan returned to public life and touring with her 2003 album release, ''[[Afterglow (Sarah McLachlan album)|Afterglow]]'', which contained the singles "[[Fallen (Sarah McLachlan song)|Fallen]]", "Stupid", and "[[World On Fire (Sarah McLachlan song)|World On Fire]]". Rather than shoot a conventional music video for "World On Fire", McLachlan donated all but $15 of the $150,000 budget to various charitable causes around the world and then used the video to explain how it benefited the communities that received the money. Like ''Surfacing'', the album reached number one in Canada and number two in the United States.

Another live album, ''[[Afterglow Live]]'', was released in late 2004. The CD consisted of several tracks from a full-length concert, which was included in its entirety on a DVD, as well as the three music videos from ''Afterglow''.

In 2004, [[Darryl McDaniels|Darryl "D.M.C." McDaniels]], who credits McLachlan and her music for lifting him from a period of depression, as he described publicly on [[NPR]] [[The Moth|Moth Radio Hour]] "Angel" dated September 9, 2014, invited her to join him on a track from his solo album. Although the album was not released until early 2006, remixes of the song "Just Like Me" were included on a number of compilations in 2005.

=== 2006: ''Wintersong'' ===
In October 2006, McLachlan released a Christmas album, ''[[Wintersong]]''. The album included 11 new recordings, featuring covers of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s "[[River (Joni Mitchell song)|River]]", [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s "[[Song for a Winter's Night]]", and [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]", which she recorded with her outreach children and youth choir, and seasonal favourites: "Christmas Time Is Here", "O Little Town of Bethlehem", "Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas", "Silent Night", "The First Noel", and "Greensleeves (What Child Is This?)", among others. The title track is an original work of McLachlan's.

''Wintersong'' debuted at No. 42 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart the week ending November 4, 2006. It peaked at No. 7. Worldwide the album has sold over 1.1 million copies to date.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It has been certified Platinum in the U.S. and 2x Platinum in Canada, where it became her third consecutive album to reach number one.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

On August 12, 2008, she released a new song from the album, "[[U Want Me 2]]", a mid-tempo contemplative love song, as a digital single in the [[iTunes Store]]; also accompanied with a video performance.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} McLachlan also admitted the song was inspired by the dissolution of her marriage, which she announced in September 2008, during initial promotion.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} "Don't Give Up on Us", the other new song on the album, was released as the second and final single on February 3, 2009. Both singles were subsequently included on her next album, ''Laws of Illusion''.

A single, "One Dream", was released on September 29, 2009 and was the official theme song of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in Vancouver.<ref name=inwood /> McLachlan's first studio album of original material in nearly seven years, ''[[Laws of Illusion]]'', was released on June 15, 2010. New York Times music critic John Pareles says about ''Laws of Illusion'' – "It's a kindly, enveloping sound that Ms. McLachlan has long used to conjure passion and empathy laced with melancholy. But now it encompasses a new anguish, deeper and sharper than what she hinted at with ''Afterglow'' in 2003."{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} It features 10 new songs in addition to the previously released tracks "U Want Me 2" and "Don't Give Up on Us", as well as various bonus tracks.

== Lilith Fair ==
{{Main|Lilith Fair}}
In 1996, McLachlan became frustrated with concert promoters and radio stations that refused to feature two female musicians in a row.<ref name="cnn072898" /> Bucking conventional industry wisdom, she booked a successful tour for herself and [[Paula Cole]]. At least one of their appearances together&nbsp;– in McLachlan's home town, on September 14, 1996&nbsp;– went by the name "Lilith Fair" and included performances by McLachlan, Cole, [[Lisa Loeb]] and [[Michelle McAdorey]], formerly of [[Crash Vegas]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The next year, McLachlan founded the Lilith Fair tour, taking ''Lilith'' from the medieval Jewish legend that [[Lilith]] was [[Adam and Eve|Adam]]'s first wife.<ref>[http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/950206_Lilith.html Looking for Lilith] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620124014/http://people.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/Shokel/950206_Lilith.html |date=June 20, 2010 }}. by Eliezer Seagal.

In 1997, Lilith Fair, featuring McLachlan as one of the headlining acts, garnered a $16 million gross, making it the top-grossing of any touring festival.<ref name="cnn072898"/> Among all concert tours for that year, it was the 16th highest grossing.<ref name="cnn072898"/> [[Lilith Fair]] tour brought together 2 million people over its three-year history and raised more than $7 million for charities. It was the most successful all-female [[music festival]] in history, one of the biggest music festivals of the 1990s, and helped launch the careers of several well-known female artists.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Subsequent Lilith Fairs followed in 1998 and 1999 before the tour was discontinued.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sarah-mclachlan-and-friends-announce-lineup-for-the-final-lilith-fair-91492/|title=Sarah McLachlan and Friends Announce Lineup for the Final Lilith Fair|last1=Skanse|first1=Richard|date=1999-04-28|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-12|archive-date=December 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214013052/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/sarah-mclachlan-and-friends-announce-lineup-for-the-final-lilith-fair-91492/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2007, the provincial government announced $500,000 in funding for the outreach program.<ref name=outreach /> Originating at the "Sarah McLachlan Music Outreach", this program evolved into the Sarah McLachlan School of Music.

===ASPCA===
McLachlan supports the [[ASPCA]] by appearing in advertisements. She filmed a two-minute advertisement for the organization which featured her song "[[Angel (Sarah McLachlan song)|Angel]]".<ref name=Strom /> The advertisement's imagery of shelter animals mixed with the soundtrack and McLachlan's simple appeal for donations has raised $30 million for the ASPCA since it began to air in 2006, which allowed the organization to air appeals in higher profile prime-time cable ad slots; subsequently the organization produced a new ad for the 2008 holiday season featuring McLachlan appealing for the ASPCA over her ''[[Wintersong]]'' performance of "[[Silent Night]]", and a new ad with her was released in January 2009 featuring the song "Answer".<ref name=Strom /> In 2012, McLachlan wrote a letter on behalf of [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] to then-Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]], protesting that country's annual [[seal hunt]].<ref>Kenyon Wallace, "[https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1159336--sarah-mclachlan-asks-stephen-harper-to-end-seal-hunt?bn=1 Sarah McLachlan Asks Stephen Harper to End Seal Hunt] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120623142056/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/politics/article/1159336--sarah-mclachlan-asks-stephen-harper-to-end-seal-hunt?bn=1 |date=June 23, 2012 }}", Toronto Star, April 10, 2012.</ref> During [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] on February 3, 2014, McLachlan parodied her ASPCA appeals in an [[Audi]] commercial featuring a "Doberhuahua" dog gnawing on the neck of her guitar.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2014/02/02/audis-menacing-mutt-super-bowl-commercial/|title=Audi's menacing mutt Super Bowl commercial|last=Judkis|first=Maura|date=February 2, 2013|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=February 3, 2014}}</ref>
