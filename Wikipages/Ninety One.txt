'''Ninety One''' or '''91''' ({{lang-kk|Тоқсан бір}}, ''Toqsan bir'') is a [[Kazakhstan|Kazakh]] [[boy group]] formed by [[Juz Entertainment|JUZ Entertainment]] in 2015.<ref name="Yvision">{{cite web|url=http://yvision.kz/post/554086|title=Знакомство с новым бойз-бэндом 91 NINETY ONE|author=|date=13 October 2015|publisher=[[Yvision]]|accessdate=2016-08-15|language=ru}}</ref>  The band consists of four members: Alem, Ace, Zaq, and Bala. Once a five-member group, A.Z. left in 2020. Ninety One is the pioneer act of a new musical genre called [[Q-pop]] ''(Qazaq-pop)'' which could be called a symbiosis of Western and Asian [[pop music]]. The group was produced by Yerbolat Bedelkhan, a member of the Kazakh music unit "Orda".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yvision.kz/post/668180|title=Группа Ninety One презентовала дебютный мини-альбом "Айыптама"|author=|date=30 December 2015|publisher=[[Tengrinews.kz]]|accessdate=2016-08-15|language=kk}}</ref>

== History ==

{{Empty section|date=May 2021}}

== 2014: KTI-boys ==
The group was founded in 2014, based on the "K-Top Idols" project, the main goal of which was creating Kazakhstan's first idol group. A.Z. and ZaQ were the winners of this project. BALA and ALEM were cast via a separate audition. ACE joined the group after training for 2.5 years at the [[S.M. Entertainment]] agency ({{lang-ko|SM엔터테인먼트}}) in South Korea. 
=== ''Q-POP'' ===
The term "Q-pop" was first coined in 2015 by the fanbase of Ninety One - "Eaglez". Fans pointed out the differences they saw in a newly-founded Asian pop genre compared to other countries pop music. The letter "Q" originates from the way country's name, "Qazaqstan", should be written according to the Latin script of Kazakh. The prefix ‘Q’ has a particular ideological connotation. Putting ‘Q’ as the prefix is a trendy way of representing new Kazakhstan. The new idea of ‘Q’ for resembling Kazakhstan was generally accepted by the masses.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Danabayev & Park|title=Q-pop as a Phenomenon to Enhance New Nationalism in Post-Soviet Kazakhstan|url=http://snuac.snu.ac.kr/2015_snuac/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/03-%EC%9E%90%EC%9C%A0%EC%A3%BC%EC%A0%9C_Danabayev-Kakim_4%EA%B5%90.pdf|journal=Asia Review|volume=9(2)|pages=85-129}}</ref>

== 2015 - 2016: Debut [[Extended play|EP]] "Aıyptama!" and hostility towards the group ==
After a year and a half, band decided to change their name to "Ninety One". The new name refers to the year 1991 when [[Kazakhstan]] won its [[Kazakhstan#Independence|independence]] from the former Soviet Union. The name "91" carries the meaning of independence and creative freedom.
On the 1st of September, 2015 Ninety One released their debut [[CD single|single]] ''Aıyptama!'' ({{lang-en|Don't judge!}}). The music video for the song was released on October 8, 2015. ''Aıyptama!'' ({{lang-en|Don't judge!}}) led the charts of Kazakhstan's music channels for 20 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gakku.kz/kk/news/2732/2732-ninety-one-pokidaut-hit-parad?force=desktop|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160821053240/http://gakku.kz/kk/news/2732/2732-ninety-one-pokidaut-hit-parad?force=desktop|url-status=dead|title=Ninety One on Gakku TV|archivedate=August 21, 2016}}</ref> On December 1, 2015, they released their first [[Extended play|EP]], also called ''Aıyptama''. This mini-album consists of 6 songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://el.kz/m/articles/view/K-pop-жанры-Ninety-One-тобы|title=K-POP жанры. Ninety One тобы|author=|date=6 November 2015|publisher=el.kz|accessdate=2016-08-15|language=kk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210171452/http://el.kz/m/articles/view/K-pop-%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%80%D1%8B-Ninety-One-%D1%82%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8B|archive-date=10 December 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>
On June 2nd, 2016 they released a music video for the song "Qaıtadan" ({{lang-en|Again}}), which is currently the chart leader on [[Gakku TV|Gákký TV]].
Music video for "Qalay Qaraisyn" (English: How do you look at that?), their third song, came out on the 11th of December, 2016. Song was included into the soundtrack of the movie "Гламұр для дур" directed by Askar Uzabaev. The song lasted 20 weeks on the 1st place of the Gákký chart.

=== Public's response ===
Ninety One, despite immediately winning the hearts of a young, mainly female, Kazakh audience, were met with a huge wave of hostility from the mainstream public. A lot of local celebrities openly bashed and humliated them, going as far as to say Ninety One were corrupting their youth. Make-up, earrings and dyed hair on men were borderline offensive to the eye of a typical Kazakh. Group's style was considered against their mentality. And while having nothing against their music, local "activists", enraged by the group's appearance, tried everything in their power to bring the group down.
Apart from receiving various insults and death threats, Ninety One also had to physically defend themselves from some overzealous anti-fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nur.kz/1271315-skandalnoy-gruppe-ninety-one-ugrozhali-vzryva.html?|title=Скандальной группе Ninety One угрожали взрывами в Актобе|date=October 4, 2016|website=www.nur.kz}}</ref>

=== First Tour "#91"===
On the 21st of June, 2016 Ninety One held their first solo concert in the city of Karaganda as a part of "#91" tour. 
A big number of group's concerts were cancelled due to the "public's" demand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nur.kz/1266368-zhiteli-aktobe-protestuyut-protiv-konc.html?|title=Жители Актобе протестуют против концерта "Ninety one" из-за их крашенных волос|date=September 29, 2016|website=www.nur.kz}}</ref> Protests were held against the group.

On the 23rd of July and up until the 5th of August, 2016 Ninety One and a music group Orda (that their producer is a part of) went together on tour around China. They gave an interview for a Kazakh magazine "Xalhar".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.787520.com/#!/home/|title=Xalhar.net Music|website=music.787520.com}}</ref>

== 2017: Second album - "Qarangy Zharyq" (Darlight/Dark light) and the movie "91" ==
On July 2nd [[Juz Entertainment|JUZ Entertainment]] announced Ninety One's second tour. JUZ Tour 2k17 was bigger and included even more cities. Tour was successful with no major interferences from anti-fans.

=== "Mooz" and the movie "91" ===
"Mooz" (English: Ice/cold) came out on the 21st of August 2017. "Mooz" is an official [[Original Sound Track|ost]] to Ninety One's biographical movie "91". 
On the 24th of August, movie «91» was released. Directed by Askar Uzabaev and produced by Assel Sadvakasova and Yerbolat Bedelkhan, this movie has become an acting debut for the members who had to play themselves on the big screen.
"91" showcases the difficulties group has experienced: Ninety one's pre-debut and early debut days were marked by the huge backlash they've received from anti-fans and general public.<ref name="auto"/>
And while some people could argue that it's too early for the group to have a movie dedicated to their story, director Askar Uzabaev was confident that the movie needs to be shot. Director even managed to persuade the group's own producer - Yerbolat Bedelkhan, who once was opposed to the idea as well.
Movie "Ninety One" entered the top three Kazakhstani streaming products; for the premiere weekend movie collected 32,672,000 [[tenge]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brod.kz/news/ninety-one-v-trojke-liderov-kazahstanskogo-prokata/|title=Кассовые сборы с 24 по 27 августа|website=brod.kz}}</ref>

== 2018 - 2019: "Dopamine" album and documentary "Петь свои песни" (English: To sing your songs) ==
On the 25th of June, 2018 Ninety One released "E.Yeah", the first song of their new album "Dopamine", quickly followed by "All I need" released on the 8th of August.
The third song of the album - "Boyman", came out on the 24th of October. "Boyman" said to be a [[tribute]] to a famous Kazakhstani figure skater [[Denis Ten]], whose death has deeply affected Ninety One members, as well as the whole of Kazakhstan.

=== International expansion ===
On the 15th of March, 2019 on the national Korean TV-channel MNET came out another episode of a popular musical game show "I can seee your voice" but this time around a Q-POP boy group Ninety One made their guest appearance. Group has won the show and got to perform with the popular [[K-POP]] group [[Mamamoo]]. At the end of the show, they've also performed their debut song "Ayiptama".
After the show aired Ninety One released their song "Ayiptama" as an exclusive digital single on Korean musical streaming platforms.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/accounts/login/|title=Login • Instagram|website=www.instagram.com}}</ref>
Also on summer in the same year they held their first ever concert in China.

=== Documentary "Петь свои песни" (To sing your songs) ===
Documentary film by Katherine Suvorova "Петь свои песни" (Kazakh name: Men sen emes), looks into the reasons behind protests against the group and cancellations of their concerts. These events reveal a huge layer of social and cultural conflicts inside the Kazakhstani society - 
conflict between the urban and rural life, between traditionalism and globalization, between the vertical line of political authority and personal freedom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://brod.kz/news/dokumentalnyj-film-pet-svoi-pesni-vyjdet-v-ogranichennyj-prokat/|title=Документальный фильм "Петь свои песни" выйдет в ограниченный прокат|website=brod.kz}}</ref>
Film explores these themes through conversations with the band members themselves, their opponents and supporters. Kazakhstani political and cultural scientists, media experts and art historians also explain why do people of Kazakhstan protest against Q-pop.<ref>https://holanews.kz/view/news/32167</ref>

== Social impact ==
Ninety One have made a huge impact on the [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://weproject.media/en/articles/detail/about-how-dimash-kudaibergen-and-ninety-one-inspire-people-worldwide-to-learn-the-kazakh-language/|title=About how Dimash Kudaibergen and Ninety One inspire people worldwide to learn the Kazakh language|website=weproject.media}}</ref>
Despite receiving multiple recommendations to switch to English or Russian, members of Ninety One are certain that their actions help popularise their country and language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nur.kz/1735534-ninety-one-otvetili-na-sovet-jah-khalib-delat-na-russkom.html?|title=Ninety One ответили на совет Jah Khalib "делать на русском"|date=June 5, 2018|website=www.nur.kz}}</ref>

On the 29th of March, 2018 a member of Ninety One - ZAQ, who's a part of the youth party [[Жас Отан]] ("Zhas Otan"),<ref>{{cite web|author=tengrinews.kz |url=https://tengrinews.kz/music/Colist-Ninety-One-pobedil-na-vyiborah-v-jas-otane-338100/ |title=Cолист Ninety One победил на выборах в "Жас Отане": 20 февраля 2018, 18:08 - новости на |location=KZ |publisher=Tengrinews.kz |date=2018-02-20 |accessdate=2021-01-26}}</ref> gave a speech on the IV Congress of Zhas Otan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://24.kz/ru/news/social/item/229854-iv-s-ezd-molodezhnogo-kryla-zhas-otan-startuet-v-astane |title=Хабар 24 - Новости Казахстана и мира на сегодня |publisher=24.kz |date= |accessdate=2021-01-26}}</ref>

Apart from the effects on the language, Ninety One and their producer - Yerbolat Bedelkhan have made a big impact on culture. Genre Q-pop is now considered the most popular musical direction amongst the youth in Kazakhstan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://inosmi.ru/social/20170817/240059738.html|title=Q-pop укрепляет самосознание Казахстана|first=© ИноСМИ ru 2000-2020При полном или частичном использовании материалов ссылка на ИноСМИ Ru обязательна Сетевое издание — Интернет-проект ИноСМИ RU зарегистрировано в Федеральной службе по надзору в сфере|last=связи|date=August 17, 2017|website=ИноСМИ.Ru}}</ref>

=== Projects ===
