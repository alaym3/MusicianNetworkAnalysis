TV One Network. Original Air Date: 27 September 2010.</ref>

They are known for their singles "[[Boogie Nights (song)|Boogie Nights]]", "[[The Groove Line]]", and "[[Always and Forever (Heatwave song)|Always and Forever]]".

==Biography==
===Heatwave's mainstream years 1976-1982===
Founding member Johnnie Wilder was an American serviceman based in [[West Germany]] when he first began performing; upon his discharge from the [[US Army]], he stayed in Germany.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> He sang in nightclubs and taverns with an assortment of bands while still enlisted.  By mid-year, he decided to relocate to the United Kingdom and through an ad placed in a local paper he linked up with songwriter/keyboardist [[Rod Temperton]].<ref name="Unsung 2010"/>

Touring the London nightclub circuit billed as ''Chicago's Heatwave'' during the mid-1970s allowed them to refine their sound, adding a funk groove to disco beats. In search of a fuller sound vocally, Johnnie Wilder called upon his brother Keith Wilder (who was performing in a local band in Dayton, Ohio) to join the band on vocals.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> The group signed to [[GTO Records]] in 1976 ([[Epic Records]] would handle GTO's releases in the states). They were paired in the studio with GTO house producer/session guitarist [[Barry Blue]] and rhythm guitarist Jesse Whitten.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> Rhythm guitarist Roy Carter replaced Whitten after Whitten was killed in a stabbing incident.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> They began creating their first album ''[[Too Hot to Handle (Heatwave album)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' in the fall of 1976.

Their third single, "Boogie Nights" from their debut album, in 1977 reached No. 2 on the British popular music charts in January and in America in November. The single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Whitburn 2010 p 40">[[Joel Whitburn|Whitburn, Joel]] (2010). ''The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits'', 9th Edition (Billboard Publications), page 293.</ref> The group's debut album, ''Too Hot to Handle'', was released in the spring of 1977, giving Heatwave a No. 11 on the Hot 200 and No. 5 on the R&B charts, while the next single, the soul ballad "Always and Forever", reached No. 18 on the Hot 100 in April 1978 and No. 2 on the R&B charts. The single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Whitburn 2010 p 40"/>

Continuing to use Barry Blue's production skills, Heatwave released their second album ''[[Central Heating (Heatwave album)|Central Heating]]'' in April 1978. Lead single "The Groove Line," reached No. 7 on the Hot 100 in July 1978. The single was certified platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="Whitburn 2010 p 40"/>

During the late 1970s, the band changed.  At first Eric Johns quit the band and Billy Jones was his replacement as guitarist.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> Then Rod Temperton quit the band.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> Although Temperton would continue writing new songs for Heatwave, he soon became better-known for his songwriting for other artists, penning award-winning songs for some of funk's biggest names, including [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]], [[The Brothers Johnson]] and [[George Benson]].<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> He also wrote for [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Quincy Jones]], but his most famous partnership remains the one forged with [[Michael Jackson]], writing three songs for his 1979 [[Epic Records|Epic]] debut ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' – "Rock With You," "Off the Wall" and "Burn This Disco Out", and three songs for the 1982 ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' LP, including the title track.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/>

Despite these changes, Heatwave were about to return to the studio when Mantese attended a party at Elton John's house in London.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> He was with his girlfriend, who decided to go home early from the party, reason unknown.  When Mantese arrived home, she was furious with him, perhaps from an incident that happened at the party and stabbed him.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> The knife hit him in the heart and for several minutes, he was clinically dead.  When, after several months, he awoke from coma, he was blind, mute and paralysed in his entire body.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> To date, he has no memory of this tragic event.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> He decided not to press charges against his girlfriend, and moved in with her after leaving the hospital.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> Mantese was replaced by bassist Derek Bramble.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> Adding keyboardist Calvin Duke to the group, and now working with new producer [[Phil Ramone]], Heatwave cut ''[[Hot Property (album)|Hot Property]]'', released in May 1979.

Around this time Heatwave performed "Keep Tomorrow for Me" used over the end credits of the action comedy "[[Escape to Athena]]". Composed by Barry Blue and written by Rod Temperton with some orchestrations by Christodoulous, the song is considered by some to be one of the group's best but never got a wide release due to the rights being locked up with [[Lew Grade]]'s ITC Entertainment. The film performed poorly at the box office and the proposed soundtrack (with a score composed by [[Lalo Schifrin]]) was cancelled except in Japan where the song was released on the soundtrack to the film under its Japanese title "Offsides 7" and only on vinyl in that country.<ref>End Credits of the Motion Picture "Escape to Athena" Soundtrack album "Offsides 7"</ref>

During the spring of 1979, Johnnie Wilder, Jr., suffered injuries in an [[auto accident]] while visiting family and friends in [[Dayton, Ohio]].<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> Although he survived, the accident left him [[paralysed]] from the neck down and unable to continue performing with the group.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> After the accident, Johnnie remained a co-producer of the group, along with Blue.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/>
  
Determined to continue working with the band he had nurtured since the very beginning, Wilder participated with studio work and, during 1980, Heatwave recorded the ''[[Candles (album)|Candles]]'' LP, with Temperton again providing the songs,<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> except stand out track "All I Am", written by Blue's former writing partner [[Lynsey de Paul]]. The group recruited James Dean "J.D." Nicholas, who later became a member of the [[Commodores]], to handle vocals in concert.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

Heatwave's November single "Gangsters of the Groove" was a popular music success,<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> scoring number twenty-one on the US R&B chart (failing to make the Hot 100 because of the [[Disco sucks|anti-disco backlash]]), and number 20 in the United Kingdom early in the New Year. But the album peaked at number 71 in the United States in December 1980.

Heatwave's 1982 LP, ''[[Current (album)|Current]]'', marked yet another new era for the band, as they returned to producer Blue. The album managed number 156 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], although it scored the band a number 21 success on the R&B charts, where Heatwave continued to be a strong presence. A Rod Temperton penned single, "Lettin' It Loose," proved a minor success during August.

Derek Bramble quit the band at the end of 1982, like Roy Carter, for a career in production<ref name="Unsung 2010"/> (he would go on to work with [[David Bowie]] on 1984s ''Tonight'' LP, and later masterminded [[Jaki Graham]]'s breakthrough). J.D. Nicholas left to replace [[Lionel Richie]] as the lead singer of the [[Commodores]]. 

===Break-up period===
In approximately 1986, Keith Wilder and Roy Carter sought the services of [[Central Line (band)|Central Line]] guitarists/songwriters Henri Defoe and Michael Finbarr Murphy (the latter having also recently produced ''Unknown Quantity,'' consisting of the 3 backing vocalists and dancers in the "Chain Reaction" hit music video by [[Diana Ross]], which also featured Michael on guitar). Keith and Roy wanted to enlist them for a tour of The British US Air Force Bases. Michael's distant cousin, [[Alan Murphy]], the now-deceased one-time guitarist for [[Kate Bush]], [[Go West (band)|Go West]], and [[Level 42]] also expressed interest in working with Heatwave as a band, though it would never materialize.

===Post-1988 Heatwave===
Silent as a band since early 1983, Heatwave reconvened in a new line-up to record and release the album ''[[The Fire (Heatwave album)|The Fire]]'' in 1988.  However, Keith Wilder was the only original member of the band present in this incarnation (although Billy Jones, who had joined the band in the late 1970s returned as well).<ref name="Discogs">[http://www.discogs.com/Heatwave-The-Fire/release/1725006 Heatwave- ''The Fire'' @ Discogs]</ref> Meanwhile, that same year, Johnnie Wilder released a solo spiritual album ''My Goals on Light''.  The Wilder brothers once again teamed up the following year for the [[gospel music|gospel]] album, ''Sound of Soul''.  None of these late 1980s albums sold well, but Heatwave's recognition was revitalised in 1991, when a [[remix]] version of their "Mind Blowing Decisions" charted in the UK.  By the mid to late 1980s, Keith Wilder was joined by bassist Dave Williamson and vocalist Donovan Blackwood and in the 1990s had again reformed the band. Joined by keyboardists Kevin Sutherland and [[Sun (R&B band)|Byron Byrd]], guitarist Bill Jones, and original drummer Ernest Berger, the reborn Heatwave launched an American tour with a live album recorded at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in Hollywood, arriving in 1997.

===Deaths===
Johnnie Wilder died in his sleep at his home in [[Dayton, Ohio]] on 13 May 2006.<ref name="Unsung 2010"/>

On 5 October 2016, Temperton's death was announced after what was described by his music publisher as "a brief aggressive battle with cancer". Temperton had died at the age of 66 in London the previous week and his funeral had already taken place.  The exact date of his death was not announced.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-37565125 |title=Rod Temperton: Thriller songwriter dies |work=BBC News|date=5 October 2016 |access-date=5 October 2016}}</ref>
