In Des Moines, Iowa, [[Joey Jordison]], [[Shawn Crahan]], and [[Mick Thomson]] approached him asking him to join Slipknot.<ref name="Arnopp71">{{Harvnb|Arnopp|2001|p=71}}</ref> He agreed to go to one of their practices, and ended up singing in front of them. Of Slipknot's nine members, Corey was the sixth to join the band. Performing with Slipknot, he would also come to be known as "Number Eight", since the band follows a numbering scheme for its members, ranging from 0â€“8. According to [[Shawn Crahan]], Corey wanted number eight, because it symbolizes [[infinity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/slipknots-shawn-crahan-explains-how-band-member-numbers-came-to-be/|title=Slipknot's Shawn Crahan Explains How Band Member Numbers Came to Be|work=Loudwire|last=Childers|first=Chad|date=July 28, 2012|access-date=May 12, 2018}}</ref>
