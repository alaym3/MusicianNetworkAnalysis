== History ==
=== Formation and early years (2005–2009) ===
{{Main|The Whorror}} Motionless in White was founded in 2005 by members Chris Motionless, who played guitar and lead vocals, Angelo Parente on drums, Frank Polumbo on guitar and Kyle White on bass during high school. They incepted many other titles into the group until finally settling on what would be Motionless in White. Chris Motionless and other members have noted bands such as [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Johnny Cash]], [[Depeche Mode]], and other musical groups as their inspiration. In 2005, they released their self-distributed [[demo (music)|demo]].<ref name="The Aquarian Weekly interview">{{cite web|last=Batista|first=Amanda|title=Interview with Motionless In White: Growing Creatures|url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2012/12/12/interview-with-motionless-in-white-growing-creatures/|work=TheAquarian.com|publisher=[[The Aquarian Weekly]]|access-date=April 12, 2014}}</ref>

Within the year after the release of their demo, new member Josh Balz was added as the band's keyboardist, Frank Polumbo took over on bass and new members, Michael Costanza and Thomas "TJ" Bell, were added to the band as the new guitarists, moving Chris Motionless solely to lead vocals.<ref name="The Aquarian Weekly interview" /> The band was discovered by Zach Neil while performing at a local nightclub called The Staircase. Neil signed the band first to management and then later to his record label Masquerade recordings. They recorded their first EP ''The Whorror'' which was produced by Zach Neil and mixed by Dan Malsch and released it through Masquerade Recordings/Warner music group in 2007.<ref name="The Whorror on AllMusic">{{cite web|title=Motionless in White The Whorror|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-whorror-mw0000488536/releases|work=Allmusic.com|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 12, 2014}}</ref>

{{Main|When Love Met Destruction}}

After touring in support of ''The Whorror'', Motionless in White had written enough songs to complete a full-length album.  The album was named ''When Love Met Destruction''. ''When Love Met Destruction'' was recorded in 2008 initially at Soundmine recording studio then finished at Zach Neil's home by Dave Cutrone and Zach Neil, and was released the same year on Masquerade Recordings. Neil added the band to his stage on the Warped tour with the new record in hand and the band quickly caught the attention of Shawn Milke from [[Alesana]] who offered to manage the band. Shortly thereafter Bob Becker of [[Fearless Records]] contacted Zach Neil to make an offer to buy the band's recording contract and sign the band to Fearless.{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}} The band and Neil agreed and Tragic Hero was offered to incubate the first official release to help grow the band leading up to their Fearless debut. The band was never actually signed to Tragic Hero Records.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Track-By-Track: Motionless in White|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/track-by-track_motionless_in_white/|magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|access-date=October 28, 2011}}</ref>

After Bell's departure, Olson then switched his position in the band from playing bass to rhythm guitar, which then left the group in-audition, once again, for a new bass player.

Sola was officially confirmed as the band's new bassist on November 27, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last=Duncan|first=Michael|title=Motionless in White Announce New Bassist|url=http://www.rockedition.com/news/motionless-in-white-announce-new-bassist/|publisher=Rock Edition|access-date=November 27, 2011}}</ref>
