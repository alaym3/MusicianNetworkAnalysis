'''IAMX''' is the solo musical project of [[Chris Corner]] of the band [[Sneaker Pimps]]. Founded in 2004 in [[London]], it is an independent music project which also focuses on and experiments with visual art.<ref name="Cat">{{cite web|url=http://catonthewall.net/?p=44 |title=CatOnTheWall.net: ''IAMX Interview'' |publisher=Blog.catonthewall.net |date=2008-05-11 |access-date=2011-02-07}}</ref> Musically, IAMX spans multiple genres from electronic rock and dance music to burlesque-influenced songs and emotional ballads. Corner's striking and wide-ranging voice, and his way of programming sounds and beats, make up the obvious characteristic of the IAMX sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darktwincities.com/reviews.php?review=187 |title=DarkTwinCities: ''IAMX - Kingdom of Welcome Addiction'' review by Christopher Roddy |publisher=darktwincities.com |date=2008-04-10 |access-date=2012-05-13}}</ref>

From 2006 until 2014 IAMX was based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], where Corner found "the spirit to care less about the music industry and take an independent route."<ref name="Cat" /> Berlin is also mentioned in IAMX's lyrics that concern subjects such as sexual identity, death, love, narcotic intoxication, decadence, critique of religion and politics, alienation, addiction, modern society, and gender bending. The topic of gender bending is further emphasised by Corner's own distinctive and androgynous image.<ref name="Front">{{cite web |url=http://i-conoclastic.co.uk/frontandcentre/?tag=iamx |title=Front & Centre: ''IAMX @ Heaven London 13/10/2011'' |publisher=i-conoclastic.co.uk |date=2011-10-13 |access-date=2012-05-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121040135/http://i-conoclastic.co.uk/frontandcentre/?tag=iamx |archive-date=21 November 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

As of 2014 to 2016, IAMX have relocated to Los Angeles from Berlin, citing a much-needed change to a better climate and a break with old ties in Berlin.

IAMX are known for their highly energetic and theatrical live performances. Unusual stage outfits and body painting are also core elements of IAMX shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sentimentalistmag.com/2007/11/05/iamx-music-hall-of-williamsburg-101607-sentimentalist-magazine-review/ |title=Sentimentalist Magazine Review: ''IAMX, Music Hall of Williamsburg, 10.16.07'' |publisher=sentimentalistmag.com |date=2007-11-05 |access-date=2012-05-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403095502/http://www.sentimentalistmag.com/2007/11/05/iamx-music-hall-of-williamsburg-101607-sentimentalist-magazine-review/ |archive-date=3 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The stage design consists of art and props constructed by Corner and his live band members.

The visual art element of the project can be seen in the IAMX music videos and in the projections at their live shows. Both contain sometimes strong and controversial visual content, often directed, shot and edited by Corner himself.<ref name="Cat" />

To date, IAMX has released nine studio albums, all of which have been released independently and produced by Corner (''[[The Unified Field]]'' was co-produced by [[Jim Abbiss]]), the latest being ''Echo Echo'', which was released on the 13th of March, 2020.

== History ==
[[File:Chris Corner at IAMX Autograph Session in Munich 2009 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Chris Corner at an IAMX autograph session in Munich]]

IAMX was founded by Corner in 2004 in London. The name 'I am X' refers to ''[[Becoming X]]'', the title of the Sneaker Pimps' debut album. Corner explained that by founding IAMX, he no longer felt that he was becoming X, but rather that he was X.<ref name="TW1">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mR8gp7n-idk |title=TW1: ''IAMX Special'' |publisher=TW1|date=2006-05-27 |access-date=2012-07-12}}</ref> The meaning of the X, according to the founder, is ever changing like a variable in a mathematical equation.<ref name="playboy">{{cite web |url=http://www.iamxinternational.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=7017#forumpost7017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403133837/http://www.iamxinternational.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=7017#forumpost7017 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-04-03 |title='IAMX Enraptures L.A.' interview |publisher=playboy.com |date=2008-09-03 |access-date=2012-06-06 }}</ref><ref name="Postwave.gr">{{cite web |url=http://www.postwave.gr/content/view/2669/9/1/1/ |title=IAMX (Chris Corner) - Αποκλειστική συνέντευξη! |publisher=Postwave.gr |date=2008-05-03 |access-date=2012-06-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130217165252/http://www.postwave.gr/content/view/2669/9/1/1/ |archive-date=17 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

=== ''Kiss + Swallow'' (2004–2006) ===
IAMX's debut album, ''[[Kiss + Swallow]]'', was released in 2004 and consisted of melancholic dark 1980s-influenced [[electro music]] with lyrical content referring often to the psychology of sexual fantasy, gender bending and role play, the exploration of solitude, aggression, longing, codependency and mortality. 
It was, as all IAMX albums to follow, written, produced and mixed by Corner himself. ''Kiss + Swallow'' was recorded in Corner's home studio in London called The Den.<ref name="k+sbooklet">{{cite book| last=Corner|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Corner|title=Kiss + Swallow|series=Album booklet |publisher=BMG|location=London|year=2004}}</ref>

Many of the songs were initially written by Corner for a fourth [[Sneaker Pimps]] album, but while the band was working on the album it soon became clear that the songs did not suit the new direction of Sneaker Pimps. The songs remained important to Corner, so he decided to keep working on them and to eventually use them for a separate project.<ref name="TW1" />

After the release of ''Kiss + Swallow'', Corner went on tour with IAMX, playing venues throughout Europe and the US. The live line-up varied between a revolving cast of close friends including Sue Denim of [[Robots in Disguise]] (whose vocals are also featured on the album),<ref name="k+sbooklet" /> [[Noel Fielding]] and [[Julian Barratt]] of [[The Mighty Boosh]], James Cook of Nemo, Mary Ambrose,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electrified.info/html/body_i_am_x___client_tour.html |title=Electrified: ''IAMX + Client Tour'' |publisher=electrified.info|date=2004-09-27 |access-date=2012-05-20}}</ref> and actress [[Julia Davis]] of ''[[Nighty Night]]''.

''Kiss + Swallow'' was released in the US on 17 June 2008. The US album included the previously unreleased track "Polaroids" and a remix of the title song by [[Moonbootica]]. It also carries a different cover.

Between tours in 2005, Corner wrote and produced the soundtrack for the French movie ''[[Sky Fighters|Les Chevaliers du Ciel]]'' (English title: ''Sky Fighters'') and the second Robots in Disguise album, ''[[Get RID!]]''.

=== ''The Alternative'' and ''Live in Warsaw'' (2006–2008) ===

IAMX's second album, ''[[The Alternative (album)|The Alternative]]'', was released in April 2006 in Europe, October 2007 (digitally) and November 2007 (physically) in the UK and Ireland, and May 2008 on Metropolis Records in the US. UK and US versions feature a slightly different cover with black tape rather than yellow tape. In addition to variant cover artwork, UK and US versions also feature alternate versions of several tracks with added production and added backing vocals from [[Janine Gezang]] as well as a hidden instrumental string version of "Spit It Out", arranged and recorded by Audrey Morse.<ref>{{cite book| last=Corner|first=Chris|author-link=Chris Corner|title=The Alternative|series=Album booklet |publisher=BMG Music Publishing UK| location=Berlin|year=2006}}</ref>

In summer 2006, a new live line-up was announced as follows: Janine Gezang on keyboards/synths, backing vocals and bass; Dean Rosenzweig on guitars and bass; and Tom Marsh on drums. Rosenzweig and Marsh left the live band in 2010, while Gezang is still an integral part of the project.

A limited edition live album, ''[[Live in Warsaw (IAMX album)|Live in Warsaw]]'', was released on 14 November 2008 on IAMX's own label, 61seconds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darktwincities.com/dtcblog/2008/10/new-live-material-from-iamx/ |title=DarkTwinCities: ''New Live Material From IAMX'' |publisher=darktwincities.com |date=2008-10-28 |access-date=2012-06-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222164620/http://darktwincities.com/dtcblog/2008/10/new-live-material-from-iamx/ |archive-date=22 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The performance was recorded in front of a live audience for [[Polskie Radio Program III]] and later mixed by Corner in Berlin at IAMX2 studios. The album was at the time exclusively available at the band's online shop Boutique IAMX before it sold out, but is now available again for digital download.

=== ''Kingdom of Welcome Addiction'' and ''Dogmatic Infidel Comedown OK'' (2009–2011) ===
The third IAMX album, ''[[Kingdom of Welcome Addiction]]'', was released on 19 May 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginmusic.com/news/archive.php?id=4851: |title=''IAMX Interview, February 2009'' |publisher=Pluginmusic.com |date=2009-02-19 |access-date=2011-02-07}}</ref>  It had a heavier sound than the previous two albums, and it was preceded by a new track entitled "Think of England", which was made available for free download on 7 November 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domeinwebshop.nl/zum-verkauf/61seconds.de/tool|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220012820/http://www.61seconds.de/think.html|url-status=dead|title=61seconds.de &#124; Domeinwebshop.nl|archive-date=20 February 2012|website=Domeinwebshop.nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.postwave.gr/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1253&Itemid=10&limit=1&limitstart=1 |title= IAMX interview: Chris Corner talks about his new album "Kingdom Of Welcome addiction" |website=61seconds.de |date=2009-02-27 |access-date=2012-07-13}}</ref>

In early 2010, the live band was announced to be Janine Gezang on keyboards/synths, vocals and bass; [[Alberto Álvarez (musician)|Alberto Álvarez]] on guitars, vocals, drums and bass, and [[Jon Harper]] on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/IAMX/status/8734713123 |title=Twitter / IAMX: ''We proudly announce our new live band members'' |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2010-02-06 |access-date=2012-06-10}}</ref> In August 2010, Harper was replaced by MAX, a drum machine which was programmed and triggered by Corner.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iamx.eu/index2.html |title=IAMX.eu: ''August 03, 2010'' |publisher=iamx.eu |date=2010-08-03 |access-date=2012-06-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120626072021/http://www.iamx.eu/index2.html |archive-date=26 June 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

A remixed and reworked version of the album entitled ''[[Dogmatic Infidel Comedown OK]]'' was released on 19 March 2010. The release features reworks done by Corner himself under the alias of UNFALL, as well as remixes and covers by other artists, including [[Alec Empire]], [[Fixmer/McCarthy|Terence Fixmer]], [[Combichrist]], [[Black Light Odyssey]] and others. The artists featured on the album were all selected and asked to contribute by IAMX.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/b18322_iamx_invites_artists_explore_kingdom.html |last=Burkart |first=Gregory |title=IAMX Invites Artists to Explore 'Kingdom' |website=Fearnet.com |date=2010-02-25 |access-date=March 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311030753/http://www.fearnet.com/news/b18322_iamx_invites_artists_explore_kingdom.html |archive-date=March 11, 2010}}</ref>

The title of the remixed album is an anagram of the original album title ''Kingdom of Welcome Addiction''.

=== ''Volatile Times'' (2011) ===

On 14 April 2010 Corner announced on the official IAMX Twitter page that he was working on his fourth studio album, which he referred to as ''IAMX4''.<ref>{{cite web|author=IAMX |url=https://twitter.com/IAMX/status/12157351159 |title=Twitter / IAMX: Deep in writing world. Cre |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2010-04-14 |access-date=2011-02-07}}</ref> On 19 October 2010 it was announced on the official IAMX Facebook page that ''IAMX4'' was now identified as ''[[Volatile Times]]''. The album was released in Europe on 18 March 2011. It peaked at #68 in the German [[Media Control Charts]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Iamx/longplay |title=Chartverfolgung / Iamx / Longplay |language=de |work=musicline.de |publisher=Phononet GmbH |access-date=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054021/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Iamx/longplay |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> About a week before the album's release, the track "Fire and Whispers" was made available for free download from the IAMX website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sonic-seducer.de/index.php/News_2011/IAMX-Song_Fire_And_Whispers_als_Gratis-Download.html |title=Sonic Seducer: ''IAMX - Fire And Whispers als Gratis Download'' |publisher=sonic-seducer.de |date=2011-03-11 |access-date=2012-06-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110919044102/http://www.sonic-seducer.de/index.php/News_2011/IAMX-Song_Fire_And_Whispers_als_Gratis-Download.html |archive-date=19 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
On 2 September 2013 an entirely re-worked version of ''Volatile Times'' was digitally released for the United States and Canada. The release included three bonus tracks: "Avalanches", "Volatile Times (IAMseX Unfall Rework)" and "Bernadette (Post Romanian Storm)".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iamx.eu/start.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130930054812/http://www.iamx.eu/start.html |archive-date=30 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Corner has repeatedly stated that creating ''Volatile Times'' was difficult emotionally.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://auxiliarymagazine.com/2013/05/29/interview-iamx/|title=interview : IAMX - Auxiliary Magazine|date=2013-05-29|work=Auxiliary Magazine|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref> He describes the album as his most self-indulgent and the peak of his inner struggle with working alone.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://regenmag.com/interviews/iamx-strength-of-will/|title=IAMX: Strength of Will|date=2013-05-30|work=ReGen Magazine|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

Caroline Weber joined the live line-up on drums in 2011, where two European tours took place: 'Fire And Whispers Tour' in the first half of the year and 'Into Asylum Tour' in the second half.

=== ''The Unified Field'' (2013–2014) ===
[[File:2013 WGT 153 IAMX.jpg|thumb|IAMX at [[Wave-Gotik-Treffen|WGT 2013]] ]]
On 1 February 2012, it was announced via IAMX's Facebook and Twitter pages that work had officially begun on the fifth studio album, which had the working title of ''IAMX5''.<ref>{{cite web|author=IAMX |url=https://twitter.com/IAMX |title=Iamx (@Iamx) |website=Twitter.com |access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> On 13 May Chris announced that there would be a vlog posted on the official IAMX YouTube channel every two weeks, which would allow the fans to view the recording process of the new album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iamx.eu/blog/?p=282 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120716161723/http://iamx.eu/blog/?p=282 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-16 |title=» Blog Archive » X on display |website=Archive.is |access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> In the third vlog, Chris revealed that the new album was to be co-produced by Jim Abbiss, who had also co-produced Sneaker Pimps' debut album, ''[[Becoming X]]'', and had produced albums for artists such as [[Adele]] and [[Arctic Monkeys]]. On 6 July 2012, via his online blog, Chris revealed the name of a track, "Come Home", from the forthcoming album.  On 1 October 2012, a new fundraising project was launched via the [[PledgeMusic]] website, which would allow fans to bid on items such as tour set lists and CDs, including the new album; the goal of this fundraiser reached its 100% target in one hour, eventually reaching 817% of the set target.  On 19 October 2012, it was announced that the album would officially be named ''[[The Unified Field]]'' and would be preceded by the first single, a double A side, to be released on 3 December.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/iamx/updates |title=IAMX Updates |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924114720/http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/iamx/updates |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> The album was released on 20 March 2013 for fans who pledged on the PledgeMusic project and 22 March 2013 to the general public.

=== ''Metanoia'' (2014–2016) ===
On 17 December 2014, a countdown was started in IAMX's social accounts. The countdown ended three days later, revealing the official announcement of a fan-funded new album using PledgeMusic, said to be released in early fall of 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/iamxmusic |title=New Album |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141225030920/http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/iamxmusic |archive-date=December 25, 2014 |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> On 11 June 2015, the album title was announced as ''[[Metanoia (IAMX album)|Metanoia]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/iamxmusic/updates/54560 |title=IAMX6 album title and its meaning |date=June 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614003754/http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/iamxmusic/updates/54560 |archive-date=June 14, 2015}}</ref> Both "Insomnia" and "Happiness" were included in the second season of the TV series ''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]''. The songs "Surrender" and "Look Outside" were featured on season 3 of the show.

Talking about the album in an interview, Chris says how ''Metanoia'' was created after a time of illness. He speaks about how coming out of a long period of insomnia and depression impacted the album heavily. He describes it as his least complicated and most honest work.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.reflectionsofdarkness.com/artists-f-j-interviews-86/16212-interview-iamx-november-2015|title=Interview: IAMX - November 2015|last=Blackmarquis|first=Phil|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-gb}}</ref> In 2015, IAMX toured the album under the name "Metanoia Tour". Beginning in the US,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://iamxmusic.com/metanoia-tour-2015/|title=Metanoia Tour 2015 - IAMX|date=2015-06-14|work=IAMX|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref> the tour also travelled through Canada and Europe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://iamxmusic.com/iamx-metanoia-tour-2016/|title=IAMX METANOIA TOUR 2016 - IAMX|date=2015-12-22|work=IAMX|access-date=2017-10-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

On 2 December 2016, IAMX's EP ''Everything Is Burning'' was released, serving as a companion piece to ''Metanoia'' with seven previously unreleased tracks and nine remixes of ''Metanoia'' songs. Of the songs on ''Everything Is Burning'', Chris says, "They were half written for ''Metanoia'', there was a surplus of material that didn’t make it to the album. It happens with every album that I do, where there are about 5-7 songs that don’t make it. However, these tracks I felt so connected to that I didn’t want to drag them into another era, they had too much of a connection to ''Metanoia'' that they had to remain connected and put the album to rest for me. This EP was in many ways me celebrating my strength and victory over that time period."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-chris-corner-of-iamx/|title=Interview - Chris Corner of IAMX - Cryptic Rock|website=crypticrock.com|date=13 October 2016|language=en-US|access-date=2017-10-02}}</ref>

=== ''Unfall'' (2017) ===

On 22 September 2017, ''Unfall'' (the German word for 'accident') was released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spillmagazine.com/spill-album-review-iamx-unfall/ |title=Spill Album Review: IAMX - Unfall |website=Spill Magazine |date=22 September 2017 |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> Chris Corner expanded his sonic palette through remixes for others and his own experimental work. Chris now turned his Unfall alias into the title for an instrumental and abstract album that showcased him working with modular synthesizers and avoiding pop radio formats. During the recording process, Chris connected with famed UK producer and friend [[Jim Abbiss]] (Adele/Ladytron/Kasabian/Arctic Monkeys), whom he worked with on Sneaker Pimps debut ''Becoming X''. Both discussed how they were spending their current time exploring and experimenting and agreed that it would be fun to have Jim hang out in Chris’ LA studio for a week and play around.  That turned into a fruitful seven days, as Jim ended up co-writing and co-producing several album tracks: "Running Point", "Trust The Machine", "Cat's Cradle", "Polar I.", "TeddyLion", "11.11", and "The Disease To Please". The last features vocals from [[The Go Go's]] rhythm guitarist and vocalist [[Jane Wiedlin]].  Chris and Jane had been looking for something to work together on, and this just came about naturally, according to Chris.

The single "Little Deaths" was released from the album on 15 September 2017.

=== ''Alive in New Light'' (2017–2018) ===
IAMX's eighth album, ''[[Alive In New Light]]'', was released on 2 February 2018. The title track "Alive in New Light", and "Mile Deep Hollow" were featured on episodes 9 and 8, respectively, of [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 4)|season 4]] of ''How to Get Away with Murder''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.electricityclub.co.uk/iamx-alive-new-light/ |title=IAMX Alive In New Light |date=February 2, 2018 |website=Electricityclub |access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref>

== Turmwerk ==

From 2008 until Corner's move to Los Angeles in 2014, IAMX were located at an old GDR factory outside Berlin. Corner spoke about the move in an interview, saying that he had bought a building which used to be a waterworks factory in the former East Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelocal.de/lifestyle/20081128-15797.html |title=Chris Corner: 'Berlin is special'' |publisher=Exberliner Magazine |date=2008-11-28 |access-date=2012-05-20}}</ref> The factory has since been named "Turmwerk" and is used for studio recording, band rehearsals, photo shoots, music video and live visual production. These productions include the music video "My Secret Friend" featuring [[Imogen Heap]], photo shoots for the cover of IAMX's fourth studio album, ''Volatile Times'', shot by Berlin photographer Ben Wolf<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ben-wolf.com/ |title=Ben Wolf |access-date=8 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170526180314/http://ben-wolf.com/ |archive-date=26 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and press photos for IAMX's fifth studio album, ''The Unified Field'', by photographers Joe Dilworth and Sammi Doll.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sammidollphoto.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214034938/http://www.sammidollphoto.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2015-02-14 |title=Index of / |access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> Corner said in an interview that his dream was to create a place for artists of all kinds where the main focus is on creativity and free thinking.<ref name="Postwave.gr" />
