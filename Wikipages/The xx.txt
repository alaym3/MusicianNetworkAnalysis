'''The xx''' are an English [[indie rock]] band from [[Wandsworth]], London, formed in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cochrane |first=Greg |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_8040000/8040046.stm |title=Introducing...The XX |work=Newsbeat |date=12 May 2009 |access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref> The band consists of Romy Madley Croft (guitar, vocals), Oliver Sim (bass guitar, vocals), Jamie Smith, also known as [[Jamie xx]] (beats, [[Akai MPC|MPC]], record production), and formerly Baria Qureshi (keyboard, guitar). They are known for their distinct and minimalist sound that blends indie rock, [[indie electronic]], [[indie pop]], [[dream pop]] and [[electro-rock]] and the dual vocalist setup of both Croft and Sim. Their music employs soft, echoed guitar, prominent bass, light electronic beats and ambient soundscape backgrounds.

The band was formed when Croft and Sim met during their time at [[Elliott School, Putney|Elliott School]], with Baria Qureshi joining the same year and Smith a year later. After posting demos on their Myspace page, they drew the attention of the [[Beggars Group]]-owned label [[Young (record label)|Young]] (formerly known as Young Turks). Working with producer [[Rodaidh McDonald]], the band released their debut album, ''[[xx (album)|xx]]'', in August 2009. The album was a commercial and critical success, reaching number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name="UK Charts"/> ranking first for ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s and second for ''[[NME]]''{{'}}s best of the year lists among others,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/dec/18/albums-2009-xx |title=The XX – XX |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=18 December 2009|access-date=31 January 2012}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/list/50-best-albums-of-2009/159978/page/5 |title=50 Best Albums of 2009 |work=NME|date=9 December 2009 |access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref> and winning the [[Mercury Prize]] in 2010.
