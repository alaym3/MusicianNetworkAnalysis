'''Annihilator''' is a Canadian [[thrash metal]] band founded in [[Ottawa]] in 1984 by guitarist [[Jeff Waters]] and vocalist [[Big John Bates|John Bates]]. They are the highest-selling Canadian thrash metal group in history, having sold more than three million albums worldwide,{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}<ref name=AnnihilatorFeast>{{cite web|url=http://www.annihilatormetal.com/forum/showthread.php?2276-New-Annihilator-Album-FEAST |title=Archived copy |access-date=June 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109234847/http://www.annihilatormetal.com/forum/showthread.php?2276-New-Annihilator-Album-FEAST |archive-date=November 9, 2013 }}</ref> although most sales have been generated outside of Canada.

Annihilator has released seventeen studio albums and has undergone many line-up changes. Waters is the only remaining original member left in the band, and usually assembles touring or session musicians to perform with him. Annihilator's first two studio albums — ''[[Alice in Hell]]'' (1989) and ''[[Never, Neverland]]'' (1990) — are considered to be influential [[Canadian heavy metal]] records.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Many of their later albums — including their third, and only major-label, album ''[[Set the World on Fire (Annihilator album)|Set the World on Fire]]'' (1993) — also received praise from critics, and enjoyed some success in Europe and Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=All Inhalators Sold After the Bonfire, Sept 2018 |url=https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Annihilator/Set_the_World_on_Fire/617/ |website=metal-archives.com |publisher=Encyclopaedia Metallum |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Pardo |first1=Pete |title=Annihilator: Set the World On Fire, Apr 2009 |url=https://www.seaoftranquility.org/reviews.php?op=showcontent&id=7669 |website=seaoftranquility.org |publisher=Sea of Tranquility |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/prof/artist/34143/ranking/cd_album/|title=アナイアレイターのアルバム売上ランキング|access-date=June 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Annihilator/1214/longplay|title=Die ganze Musik im Internet: Charts, Neuerscheinungen, Tickets, Genres, Genresuche, Genrelexikon, Künstler-Suche, Musik-Suche, Track-Suche, Ticket-Suche - musicline.de|first=musicline.de / PhonoNet|last=GmbH|website=musicline.de|access-date=June 1, 2017}}{{Dead link|date=November 2021}}</ref> Their recent studio album, ''[[Ballistic, Sadistic]]'', was released on January 24, 2020.<ref name=BallisticSadistic>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilator-to-release-ballistic-sadistic-album-in-january-i-am-warfare-single-now-available/|title=ANNIHILATOR To Release 'Ballistic, Sadistic' Album In January; 'I Am Warfare' Single Now Available|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=October 10, 2019|access-date=October 10, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===Early career (1984–1988)===
[[File:Annihilator Rockharz 2016 21.jpg|thumb|Singer and guitarist [[Jeff Waters]], who formed Annihilator in 1984, at Rockharz Open Air 2016 in Germany.]]
Annihilator was formed in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], by [[Jeff Waters]] and [[Big John Bates|John Bates]] in 1984. Waters said that he named the band after the tank that [[Eddie Murphy]]'s character rode on in the 1984 film ''[[Best Defense]]''.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Waters and singer Bates wrote and recorded the song "Annihilator" (not to be confused with the song of the same name released on the 1994 album, ''[[King of the Kill]]''). This original version of "Annihilator" was released on the special edition of the 2005 album ''[[Schizo Deluxe]]''.

Waters and Bates then recruited [[drummer]] Paul Malek and [[bassist]] Dave Scott. In 1985, the band produced a demo titled "Welcome To Your Death".<ref>{{cite web |title=Annihilator – Welcome To Your Death |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/1541306-Annihilator-Welcome-To-Your-Death |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref> Bates and Scott left the band before its release, citing "artistic differences" and "personality conflicts". In 1986, Waters and Malek recorded another demo, titled Phantasmagoria.<ref>{{cite web |title=Annihilator – Phantasmagoria Demo 86 |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/1033408-Annihilator-Phantasmagoria-Demo-86 |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref> A third demo, "Wicked Mystic/Word Salad" was recorded by Waters and Malek in 1987 and  sent only to labels.<ref>{{cite web |title=Annihilator – Wicked Mystic / Word Salad |url=https://www.discogs.com/release/11288047-Annihilator-Wicked-Mystic-Word-Salad |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref>  Waters then moved to [[Vancouver]], where he assembled an entire line-up, including drummer Ray Hartmann and former [[D.O.A. (band)|D.O.A.]] bassist [[Randy Rampage]] on vocals. In 1988 and 1989, Waters recorded guitar and bass tracks and produced what would become the band's debut album. Once the album was finished, he hired bassist Wayne Darley and guitarist Anthony Greenham.

===Rise to fame (1989–1993)===
Annihilator gained more recognition in the metal community with the release of their debut album, ''[[Alice in Hell]]'', in early 1989. The band embarked on their first world tour, opening up for [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]] in Europe on their ''[[In Search of Sanity]]'' tour, and along with [[Wrathchild America]], they supported [[Testament (band)|Testament]] in the United States and Canada on the latter's ''[[Practice What You Preach]]'' tour. The band also opened for [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] and [[Metal Church]]. After the tour to support ''Alice in Hell'' ended in December 1989, frontman [[Randy Rampage]] left Annihilator to retain his seniority at a job on the shipping docks in North Vancouver.<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|title=Annihilator Tour Dates|url=http://metallipromo.com/annihilator.html|work=metallipromo.com|accessdate=May 11, 2021}}</ref>

Rampage was replaced by former [[Omen (band)|Omen]] singer Coburn Pharr and the band released their second album, ''[[Never, Neverland]]'', in 1990. The album's sales surpassed ''Alice in Hell'', becoming the band's only album to chart in the UK at No. 48. Annihilator spent half a year touring with such bands as [[Reverend (band)|Reverend]], [[Pantera]] and [[Xentrix]], and opened for [[Judas Priest]] on the latter's ''[[Painkiller (Judas Priest album)|Painkiller]]'' [[Painkiller Tour|tour]] in Europe.<ref name="metallipromo"/> After the ''Never, Neverland'' tour ended in the spring of 1991, Hartmann and Pharr left the band and were replaced by [[Mike Mangini]] (though the band would find a more permanent replacement in Randy Black) and Aaron Randall, respectively.<ref name="metallipromo"/> The band was signed to [[Sony Corporation of America|Sony USA]] by this point.

The band's third studio album, ''[[Set the World on Fire (Annihilator album)|Set the World on Fire]]'', distributed by [[Epic Records]], was released in 1993 and was successful in Europe and Asia, but did poorly in the United States. It saw Annihilator drastically change the sound of their music, toning down the speed and thrash elements of its predecessors in favor of a more radio friendly sound. Bassist Wayne Darley had to leave the band in August 1993 as he was unable to enter Japan, where the band was touring in support of the album. Annihilator was among the many metal bands dropped by Roadrunner Records (and most other labels) that year. Nonetheless, the band embarked on extensive tours to promote ''Set the World on Fire'', touring in Europe with [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]] and in North America with [[Lillian Axe]], and appearing at the [[Dynamo Open Air]] festival in the Netherlands.<ref name="metallipromo"/>

===Brief hiatus and later years (1994–2002)===
Annihilator temporarily dissolved, but Jeff Waters kept the band name going when he, along with drummer Randy Black, recorded and released ''[[King of the Kill]]'' in 1994. This album was more of a solo album for Waters, as it featured himself performing all instruments and writing most of the album's material apart from playing the drum tracks, which were recorded by Randy Black. Musically and lyrically, ''King of the Kill'' was a considerable improvement from ''Set the World on Fire'', which not only saw the band return to the thrashier sound of their first two albums, but saw them lean towards a [[groove metal|groove]]-oriented vein.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalnerdblog.com/2019/10/20/annihilator-king-of-the-kill-review/|title=Annihilator – King Of The Kill Review – Metal-Nerd Blog|website=metalnerdblog.com|date=October 20, 2019|access-date=May 12, 2021}}</ref> Bassist Cam Dixon later joined the band followed by Lou Bujdoso from Meatwagon who went on to tour and perform during the King of the Kill and Refresh the Demon tours. Jeff Waters continued performing lead vocals until 1997. The band released ''[[Refresh the Demon]]'', which was, for the most part, a return to the speed and technicality of the band's earlier days, in 1996 and ''[[Remains (Annihilator album)|Remains]]'', a more industrial metal-oriented album which turned out to be the biggest flop of the band's career, in 1997.

By the time ''Remains'' was being recorded, Waters was the sole remaining band member. The album featured an electric drum machine (programmed by Jeff Waters) and there was no tour in support of it. At the time of its recording, Waters was going through a rough divorce and a custody battle for his children which helped lead to Annihilator's hiatus.

Inspired after seeing [[Slayer]] perform in [[Vancouver]] in the summer of 1998, Waters decided to reunite the ''Alice in Hell'' line-up to record another album. All members apart from Wayne Darley, who had health problems, agreed to reunite. Bassist Russ Bergquist joined the band in Darley's place. This lineup released ''[[Criteria for a Black Widow]]'' and toured successfully. However, Rampage was fired following the tour for his erratic and often drunken behaviour. Then-[[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] guitarist and former [[Liege Lord]] frontman Joe Comeau requested to replace him during the tour, while Curran Murphy replaced Davis on guitar and Randy Black rejoined on drums.

During the early 2000s, Annihilator released the albums ''[[Carnival Diablos]]'' (2001) and ''[[Waking the Fury]]'' (2002), both very critically successful. After considerable success, the band's lineup once again dissolved.

===The Dave Padden era (2003–2013)===
Following years of line-up changes, Jeff Waters decided to work with a touring-only lineup so he recruited Dave Padden as a permanent vocalist/rhythm guitarist, while Waters recruited touring bassists and drummers. Annihilator's first two albums in this three-man band format as Waters played both bass and guitar, with Padden on vocals and a hired drummer were ''[[All for You (Annihilator album)|All for You]]'' (2004) and ''[[Schizo Deluxe]]'' (2005). [[Mike Mangini]] rejoined for the former album in 2004 and Tony Chappelle was hired for the latter's recording in 2005.

In 2007, Annihilator released their twelfth album ''[[Metal (Annihilator album)|Metal]]''. It features several guest performers, such as [[Corey Beaulieu]] ([[Trivium (band)|Trivium]]), [[Willie Adler]] ([[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]]) and [[Jeff Loomis]] ([[Nevermore]]). The band's [[Annihilator (album)|self-titled thirteenth album]] was released in 2010, coming to be in a more modern thrash metal-styled sound.

Annihilator returned to Canada for two live shows, making it the first time since 1993 that the band had played live in North America. On July 10, 2011, Annihilator headlined the Quebec City Imperial Theatre to a sold-out crowd. They played the main stage (along with [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] and [[Motörhead]]) on July 24, 2011 at Montreal's Heavy MTL Festival.

Annihilator released their fourteenth studio album entitled ''[[Feast (Annihilator album)|Feast]]'' on August 23, 2013.<ref name=AnnihilatorFeast/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalphoto.net/reviews&review=2924#.VmYU2dIrLcs|title=Annihilator: Feast DeLuxe - FESTIVALPHOTO|website=www.festivalphoto.net|access-date=June 1, 2017}}</ref>

===Departure of Dave Padden and ''Suicide Society'' (2014–2016)===
In the summer of 2014, Oscar Rangel replaced Al Campuzano, their bassist since 2010. Jeff Waters said on his Facebook that he had actually contacted Wayne Darley, the band's bassist from the classic early 1990s lineup, about having him rejoin, although once again he declined, in Jeff's words "Wayne wanted to do it but couldn't ... personal reasons."  The band has continued their touring cycle since then.

[[Dave Padden]] left the band sometime in December 2014 via a phone call to Jeff Waters, informing him of his desire to step away from the constant touring in order to spend more time with his family. Waters unsuccessfully attempted to persuade Padden to remain in the band, offering him a pay rise. He later admitted in a German radio interview to being emotionally shaken by the departure. After a number of weeks searching for a replacement vocalist, Waters decided that he would handle vocals himself once again, in addition to doing everything but play drums in the studio. Padden's departure was not made public until six months later, in June 2015, when Waters made an announcement on Annihilator's Facebook page, but attaching a YouTube link directly below of audio snippets from various songs on the band's then-upcoming album, ''[[Suicide Society]]''.

''Never, Neverland'' singer, Coburn Pharr surprised audiences when he returned for a short time on 70000 Tons of Metal concert in January 2015. Pharr performed the songs Reduced to Ash, The Fun Palace, I Am In Command, Road to Ruin and Stonewall.

By April 2015, Annihilator had begun work on their fifteenth studio album. Waters stated that the album's musical direction would be "something quite different."<ref>{{cite web|title=Annihilator's Jeff Waters On Upcoming Album: 'It's Actually Gonna Be Something Quite Different'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilators-jeff-waters-on-upcoming-album-its-actually-gonna-be-something-quite-different/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=April 4, 2015|access-date=April 5, 2015}}</ref> The album, titled ''[[Suicide Society]]'', was released on September 18, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annihilator's Jeff Waters Returns To Lead Vocals On Band's New Album, 'Suicide Society'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilators-jeff-waters-returns-to-lead-vocals-on-bands-new-album-suicide-society/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 2, 2015|access-date=June 2, 2015}}</ref>

Drummer Mike Harshaw announced via his Facebook page in May 2016 that he had parted ways with Annihilator amicably after four years in order to spend more time with his family as well as to pursue other musical interests as he continued work with his own band, Prismind. Fabio Alessandrini joined Annihilator shortly thereafter.

In September 2016, Annihilator played Calgary Metalfest alongside fellow Canadian speed/thrash metal pioneers Exciter, Razor, Sacrifice and a local band Gatekrashör.

In late November 2016, the band announced a compilation album, entitled ''Triple Threat'', which was released through UDR Records on January 27, 2017. The album consists of three discs, including one containing Annihilator's [[Jeff Waters]], Aaron Homma, and Rich Gray (formerly Hinks)<ref>{{cite web|title=Rich Gray Facebook announcement|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=2982286728487656&set=a.136228673093490&type=3&theater|access-date=June 28, 2020}}</ref> along with other artists playing an acoustic set of the band's most well-known ballads and acoustic songs, all done in single takes. The second and third discs were released as [[Blu-ray]] DVDs, one containing Annihilator's full set at Bang Your Head Festival in Germany, and the other containing a documentary profiling the band's extensive career.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annihilator To Release 'Triple Threat' Three-Disc Set In January|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilator-to-release-triple-threat-three-disc-set-in-january/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=November 22, 2016|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Annihilator: Trailer For 'Triple Threat' Three-Disc Set|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilator-trailer-for-triple-threat-three-disc-set/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=November 30, 2016|access-date=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

===''For the Demented'' and ''Ballistic, Sadistic'' (2017–present)===
By the end of 2016, Annihilator had begun working on their sixteenth studio album. Waters stated, "On the next one, the changes I'm gonna make… I only said two things. I've got all these people telling me, 'You've gotta go back to this album,' or that album, or that album, or that album. 'You've gotta do this,' 'You've gotta do that.' So what I do is I block it out. But I've decided that I'm going to not worry about catchy, commercial choruses — 'commercial,' as in you remember it, where you intentionally make that chorus the most important part of the song and you want people to remember that one every time. That kind of is the opposite of what I used to do in the earlier days. In the earlier days, I would go, 'I don't care about the chorus being the main part; I want the whole song to be cool.' So therefore the choruses were not as commercial or catchy. And they remained heavy back then; the choruses would end up being heavy. Whereas on my ''Suicide Society'' record I just did, you could have a heavy song, but then you hit the chorus and you go, 'Woah, that's pretty mainstream stuff in the choruses.' And the other thing was, since I'm such a fan of so many bands, I let myself go a little bit on the last album with being too blatantly obvious with my influences and my musical loves as a fan. So you really heard a song that had a lot of the ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' era of music from [[Metallica]], and you really heard a [[Megadeth]]-y song on there, and you really heard in my vocals some [[James Hetfield|Hetfield]] and [[Dave Mustaine|Mustaine]]-isms. And I think that was great, as a fan, to get it out, but I think I need to do more of my own thing on the next record."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilator-jeff-waters-wont-worry-about-writing-catchy-commercial-choruses-on-next-album/|title=Annihilator's Jeff Waters Won't Worry About Writing 'Catchy, Commercial Choruses' On Next Album|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=December 27, 2016|access-date=December 27, 2016}}</ref>

In February 2017, Jeff Waters said that the sixteenth Annihilator studio album was being co-produced and co-engineered by bassist Rich Gray, making it the "first time I've actually had somebody else in the studio since 1990 (''Never, Neverland'') working with me on stuff."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/annihilatorband/videos/10155003397219731/|title='Snowy and cold but a beautiful day to hit the studio, working on studio cd 16 for ANNIHILATOR!!'|date=February 11, 2017|access-date=February 22, 2017}}</ref> On September 12, 2017, it was announced that the album, now titled ''[[For the Demented]]'', would be released on November 3;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilator-to-release-for-the-demented-album-in-november-cover-artwork-unveiled/|title=ANNIHILATOR To Release 'For The Demented' Album In November; Cover Artwork Unveiled|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> more details on the album, including track listing and artwork, and the music video for "Twisted Lobotomy" were released on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/annihilator-releases-video-for-new-song-twisted-lobotomy-unveils-for-the-demented-album-details.html|title=Annihilator Releases Video For New Song 'Twisted Lobotomy', Unveils 'For The Demented' Album Details|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 12, 2017|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> In support of ''For the Demented'', Annihilator (along with [[Death Angel]]) opened for [[Testament (band)|Testament]] on the European ''[[Brotherhood of the Snake]]'' tour, which took place in November and December 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-to-tour-europe-with-annihilator-death-angel/|title=Testament To Tour Europe With Annihilator, Death Angel|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=June 9, 2017|access-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref> The band toured Europe twice in 2018; first with Testament and [[Vader (band)|Vader]] in March and April,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=137870|title=Testament, Annihilator & Vader UK/Ireland Tour Announced|publisher=metalunderground.com|date=November 1, 2017|access-date=November 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-announces-second-leg-of-european-tour-annihilator-and-vader-to-support/|title=Testament Announces Second Leg Of European Tour; Annihilator And Vader To Support|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=November 2, 2017|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> and toured there again from October to December.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/community_feed/annihilator_announce_european_tour.html|title=Annihilator Announce European Tour|publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive|Ultimate-Guitar.com]]|access-date=September 26, 2018|date=September 26, 2018}}</ref>

== Influences ==
In a 2013 interview with Photogroupie.com, Waters acknowledged his influences, stating: "I started listening to [[Elton John]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[The Sweet|Sweet]], [[AC/DC]] then it evolved from hard rock with electric guitar to [[Black Sabbath]] and the heavier stuff, [[Judas Priest]], [[Iron Maiden|Maiden]], [[Loudness (band)|Loudness]], [[Van Halen]] was coming in. Then I get turned on to the thrash stuff, so then it was [[Razor (band)|Razor]], [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]]... Those first albums were a huge influence on metal bands." Elsewhere in the interview, Waters talked about the impact Iron Maiden had on him and the band: "They're all great...but [[Bruce Dickinson]] is one brilliant, unique, gifted, talented person...the guy's a genius."<ref>{{Cite web|last=photogroupie|date=August 13, 2013|title=JEFF WATERS INTERVIEW|url=https://www.photogroupie.com/post/2013/08/13/jeff-waters-interview|access-date=February 8, 2021|website=photogroupie}}</ref>
