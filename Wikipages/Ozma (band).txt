'''Ozma''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Pasadena, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ozma-mn0000898551/biography|title=Ozma {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> The band's sound is a mix of nostalgic [[New wave music|new wave]]–influenced [[power pop]] and [[contrapuntal]] [[Casiotone]]-driven melodies sustained by heavy guitar riffs. Since their formation in 1995, Ozma has released five studio albums and toured the U.S., Japan and Canada<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dabelly.com/features/feature166.htm|title=Daniel Brummel and Ryen Slegr of Ozma in DaBelly Magazine|last=www.dabelly.com/|first=Dave Schwartz|website=www.dabelly.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> more than thirty times, including extensive touring with stylistically similar groups including [[Weezer]], [[Nada Surf]], [[Rilo Kiley]], [[Superdrag]], [[The Rentals]], [[The Get Up Kids]], [[Piebald (band)|Piebald]], [[Saves the Day|Saves The Day]], [[Asian Kung-Fu Generation]], and [[Rooney (band)|Rooney]].

==History==
===Early years (1995–2001)===
Ozma was formed in September 1995 by [[Ryen Slegr]] (vocals/guitar), Jose Galvez (guitar/vocals), Patrick Edwards (drums) and [[Daniel Brummel]] (vocals/bass), when Brummel was introduced to the others by Galvez, whom he met on [[AOL]] while looking for a band to join. In 1996, the still-unnamed band were joined by Katherine Kieckhefer on keyboards, before deciding on the name "Ozma" (taken from the [[L. Frank Baum]] books on the drummer's mother's bookshelf)<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.wehoville.com/2013/06/13/q-and-a-ozmas-daniel-brummel-talks-troubadour-weezer-and-back-to-the-future/|title=Q-and-A: Ozma's Daniel Brummel Talks Troubadour, Weezer and Back to the Future|date=2013-06-13|work=WEHOville|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}</ref> in 1997, and in 1998 were joined by expert keyboardist Star Wick,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ozma-mn0000898551/biography|title=Ozma {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> who replaced the departing Kieckhefer. After their early 4-track cassette demos ''Cuatro'' and ''Ocho'' were well received by friends, they released ''Songs of Inaudible Trucks and Cars'' in early 1999, a collection of demos and live tracks, released on home-made CD-Rs and later republished on [[MP3.com]] as ''Songs of Audible Trucks and Cars'' (due to a character restriction). They then self-released what is considered their first "proper" studio album,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/2680/reviews/1989-|title=Album Review: Ozma - Rock And Roll Part Three|work=DrownedInSound|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en|archive-date=2017-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201132227/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/2680/reviews/1989-|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[Rock and Roll Part Three]],'' on January 1, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ozma-mn0000898551/biography|title=Ozma {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> This consisted of "a few thousand" (estimated by Brummel) CDs manufactured by their own label, Tornado Recordings. During these early years, Ozma "played almost anywhere in the California state area,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ozma-mn0000898551/biography|title=Ozma {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> garnering a strong regional following.

Ozma's first real break came in 2001, when they were selected to tour with [[Weezer]]. In preparation for the "Yahoo! Outloud Tour," Weezer asked their fans to vote for an opening act via their web site, and the bands who received the most votes were Ozma and [[The Get Up Kids]].<ref name="weezertour">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/501|title=Weezer / Get Up Kids / Ozma|author=punknews.org|date=2001-09-03|access-date=2011-04-30}}</ref>  One year later, [[Weezer]] invited Ozma to tour with them again on 2002's "Hyper Extended Midget Tour", which also featured [[Saves the Day]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Weezer Extends Midget Tour|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/77230/weezer-extends-midget-tour|work=Billboard|access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref>

Early in 2001, the band self-released their second album ''[[The Doubble Donkey Disc]]'' (later reissued on Kung Fu Records). With this release, Ozma experimented with the traditional Russian [[balalaika]] and the [[flute]] to create a sound they called "Russian coldfusion." The disc was split into two imaginary concept EPs: the first five songs (including the Russian folk song "[[Korobeiniki]]", more famously the ''[[Tetris]]'' theme) revolved around Russian themes, while the second half created a more danceable atmosphere.

===Kung Fu years (2001–2004)===
Later in 2001, partly as a result of the exposure gained from touring with Weezer, Ozma signed with [[Kung Fu Records]], which led to a mainstage appearance on the 2002 [[Warped Tour]]. Over the next two years, Kung Fu put out remastered and enhanced versions of ''Rock and Roll Part Three'' and ''The Doubble Donkey Disc'',<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/75303/ozma-stays-on-warped-tour-despite-keyboardists-injury|title=Ozma stays on Warped Tour despite keyboardist's injury|author=Billboard.com|access-date=2011-04-30}}</ref> before Ozma's third album, [[Spending Time on the Borderline|''Spending Time On The Borderline'']], was released in 2003. This record saw Ozma mature their sound and expand their musical outlook, moving away—at times significantly—from the keyboard-driven, often video game–themed rock of the earlier albums. During the 2001–4 period, Ozma toured the US numerous times, with bands such as [[Nada Surf]], [[Superdrag]], [[Piebald (band)|Piebald]], [[The Format]], and [[Rilo Kiley]]. 

On July 23, 2004, Ozma announced that they had disbanded, citing deteriorating relationships between band members. Daniel Brummel moved to New York City to pursue a more folk-heavy style and released his debut solo album ''Speak Easy'' independently on September 27, 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://seaver-faculty.pepperdine.edu/kwaters/pp/pp12.htm|title=Daniel Brummel: The Alchemist|last=Alahouzos|first=Michael|date=2006|website=Pepperdine University|access-date=2017-12-01}}</ref> Also during this interim period, [[Ryen Slegr]] and Jose Galvez formed ''Yes Dear'' with ex-members of Arlo and Teen Heroes. On January 9, 2006, Ozma announced that the band had reunited—without Edwards—to play new shows, new songs, and put out new records. During July and August 2006 the band joined [[The Rentals]] for the "Return Tour," with Slegr (now an official member of [[The Rentals]]) performing in both bands. During the tour, Ozma rotated many new songs through their setlist. In September, the band announced that they would be touring the nation again in October with the band [[Hellogoodbye]].

===''Pasadena'' (2006–2013)===

On May 15, 2007, the band released their fourth studio album, ''[[Pasadena (album)|Pasadena]]'' (after their hometown of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena, CA]]), through About a Girl Records. The album included guest appearances by [[Matthew Caws]] ([[Nada Surf]]), [[Will Noon]] ([[Straylight Run]], [[Fun (band)|Fun]]), [[Rachel Haden]] ([[The Rentals]], [[That Dog|that dog.]]), Ben Pringle ([[The Rentals]], [[Nerf Herder]]), and Eric Summer ([[Get Set Go]]). Allmusic referred to ''Pasadena'' as "the strongest work of their careers," rating it 4.5 out of 5 stars.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mason|first=Stewart|title=Pasadena Review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/pasadena-mw0000570253|work=Allmusic|access-date=29 May 2013}}</ref>

===''Boomtown'' (2012–present)===

In 2012, Ozma performed on the inaugural Weezer Cruise, alongside [[Dinosaur Jr.|Dinosaur Jr]]. and [[Sebadoh]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/feb/06/weezer-cruise|title=All aboard the Weezer cruise: an extensive report|last=Fonarow|first=Wendy|date=2012-02-06|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Then, in late 2013, Ozma held [[PledgeMusic]] campaign to fund their unnamed fifth album. Their goal was exceeded, and ''[[Boomtown (Ozma album)|Boomtown]]'' was released digitally on February 11, 2014. Immediately following the digital release, Ozma joined Weezer, [[Cat Power]], [[The Orwells]], [[DIIV]], and [[Adam DeVine|Adam Devine]] on the second Weezer Cruise, being the only band aside from Weezer to perform on both cruises.

==Popular culture==
Ozma's cover of the Russian folk song "[[Korobeiniki]]" was featured in ''[[Kick-Ass 2 (film)|Kick-Ass 2]]''.

A person in the crowd in the film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'' can be seen wearing an Ozma t-shirt.

The song "Rocks" was heard in the [[Nickelodeon]] teen sitcom [[iCarly]], in the 2008 episode ''iMight Switch Schools.''<ref>{{Citation|title="iCarly" iMight Switch Schools (TV Episode 2008)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1157511/soundtrack|access-date=2017-12-02}}</ref>
