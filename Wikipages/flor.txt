'''Flor''' (Spanish and Portuguese for ''flower'') in [[winemaking]], is a film of [[yeast]] on the surface of [[wine]], important in the manufacture of some styles of [[sherry]]. The flor is formed naturally under certain winemaking conditions, from indigenous yeasts found in the region of [[Andalucía]] in southern [[Spain]]. Normally in winemaking, it is essential to keep young wines away from exposure to air by sealing them in airtight barrels, to avoid contamination by [[bacteria]] and yeasts that tend to spoil it. However, in the manufacture of sherries, the slightly porous oak barrels are deliberately filled only about five-sixths full with the young wine, leaving "the space of two fists" empty to allow the flor yeast to take form and the [[bung]] is not completely sealed. The flor favors cooler climates and higher humidity, so the sherries produced in the coastal [[Sanlúcar de Barrameda]] and [[El Puerto de Santa María]] have a thicker cap of flor than those produced inland in [[Jerez]]. The yeast gives the resulting sherry its distinctive fresh taste, with residual flavors of fresh bread. Depending on the development of the wine, it may be aged entirely under the veil of flor to produce a [[fino]] or [[manzanilla (wine)|manzanilla]]  sherry, or it may be fortified to limit the growth of flor and undergo oxidative aging to produce an [[amontillado]] or [[oloroso]] sherry.

During the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] phase of sherry production, the flor yeast works [[Anaerobic_organism|anaerobically]], converting [[sugar (wine)|sugar]] into ethanol. When all the sugar has been consumed, the physiology of the yeast changes to where it begins an [[Aerobic_organism|aerobic]] process of breaking down and converting the [[acids in wine|acids]] into other compounds such as [[acetaldehyde]]. A waxy coating appears on the cells' exterior, causing the yeast to float to the surface and form a protective "blanket" thick enough to shield the wine from [[oxygen]]. This process drastically lowers the acidity of the wine and makes sherry one of the most aldehydic wines in the world. Studies have shown that for the flor to thrive, the wine must stay in a narrow alcohol range of 14.5% to 16% [[ABV]]. Below 14.5% the yeast will not form its protective cap, and so the wine will [[oxidize]] to the point of becoming [[vinegar]]. Above 16% the flor cannot survive, and so the wine essentially becomes an [[oloroso]].<ref name="Oxford pg 664-665">Robinson, J. (ed).

==Other regions==
A film of yeast similar to flor is also used in the production of [[vin jaune]] in the [[Jura wine]] region in eastern [[France]]. The French term used for this yeast film is ''voile'', meaning "[[veil]]".

A similar yeast to flor is used in the production of ''Szamorodni szaraz'' in the [[Tokaj]] wine region in northeastern [[Hungary]]. The Hungarian name for this yeast is ''hártya'' which means ''film''.

Natural yeast film was traditionally used in [[Gose]] beer to seal bottles, instead of caps or corks.

Flor is also present in some [[Vernaccia di Oristano]] D.O.C. a wine from the italian region of [[Sardinia]].
