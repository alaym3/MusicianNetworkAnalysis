'''Eels''' (often typeset as '''eels''' or '''EELS''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1991 by singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist [[Mark Oliver Everett]], known by the [[stage name]] '''E'''. Band members have changed over the years, both in the studio and on stage, making Everett the only official member for most of the band's work. Eels' music is often filled with themes of family, death, and unrequited love. Since 1996, Eels has released thirteen studio albums, seven of which charted in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Eels - Chart history {{!}} Billboard|url = http://www.billboard.com/artist/301484/eels/chart?f=305|website = www.billboard.com|access-date = 2015-06-23|archive-date = 2015-11-06|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151106002802/http://www.billboard.com/artist/301484/eels/chart?f=305|url-status = dead}}</ref>

==History==

===E solo records===
In 1991, Everett signed a contract with [[Polydor]] and released ''[[A Man Called E]]'' under the name E a year later. The single "Hello Cruel World" was a minor success. Touring to support the album, E opened for [[Tori Amos]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Things the grandchildren should know|last=Everett, Mark, 1963-|date=2008|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books|isbn=978-0-312-38513-2|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=213451480|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/thingsgrandchild00ever_0}}</ref> ''A Man Called E'' was followed by ''[[Broken Toy Shop]]'' in 1993. This year also marked the beginning of E's collaboration with drummer [[Jonathan "Butch" Norton]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} After ''Broken Toy Shop'', E was released from his record deal with Polydor.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} E himself has recovered two of the songs ('The Only Thing I Care About' and 'Manchester Girl') from [[Broken Toy Shop]] for his own live shows with the Eels.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===''Beautiful Freak''===
Eels were officially founded when Butch and E met [[Tommy Walter]]. The name "Eels" was chosen so that the band's records would be close to E's solo records in an alphabetical ordering, although it was too late once they realized that numerous [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] releases were in between.<ref>Everett, Mark Oliver: ''[[Things the Grandchildren Should Know]]'', Page 110, Picador 2009.</ref> Eels became one of the first groups to sign a record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]], followed by [[Elliott Smith]].

In 1996, the band released their debut album ''[[Beautiful Freak]]'', a melancholy pop record with tormented lyrics.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The singles "[[Novocaine for the Soul]]", "[[Susan's House]]" and "[[Your Lucky Day in Hell]]" achieved modest national and international success, winning the ''Best International Breakthrough Act'' award at the [[1998 BRIT Awards]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} In 1996 and 1997, Eels toured extensively to support the album, building their name as a live act in the United States and Europe. In September 1997, Walter quit the band.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Released in May 2001, the Shrek animated motion picture soundtrack included the song "My Beloved Monster".

===''Electro-Shock Blues''===
Following the success of ''Beautiful Freak'', E experienced a difficult time in his personal life. His sister committed suicide, and his mother was diagnosed with cancer. These events inspired him to write ''[[Electro-Shock Blues]]'', which focuses on his family. "Electro-Shock Blues" was released in 1998. The album deals with many difficult subjects including suicide, death and cancer. The tragedy of Everett's father's death became prominent once more in the context of his mother's pending death and his sister's suicide, and as a result the song "Baby Genius" is written for his father [[Hugh Everett III]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/mark-oliver-everett-the-eels-frontman-on-lost-loves-parallel-universes-and-staying-positive-9202630.html|title=Mark Oliver Everett: The Eels frontman on lost loves, parallel|last=Richman|first=Darren|date=23 March 2014|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Contributions to the album were made by [[Jon Brion]], [[Lisa Germano]], Jim Jacobsen, [[Grant-Lee Phillips]], [[Dust Brothers|Dust Brother]] Michael Simpson, and [[T-Bone Burnett]].

The single "[[Last Stop: This Town]]" saw minor success; "[[Cancer for the Cure]]", the second single from the album, was used on the ''[[American Beauty (1999 film)|American Beauty]]'' soundtrack.

Still a three-piece band on stage, Tommy Walter was replaced by [[Adam Siegel]]. Part of the American leg of the tour was cancelled after the death of E's mother.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} They returned to tour Europe later in the year, to open for [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===''Daisies of the Galaxy''===
In 2000, Eels released ''[[Daisies of the Galaxy]]''. The album, which was recorded almost entirely in E's basement, is lighter and more upbeat than its predecessor.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Everett noted, "if ''Electro-Shock Blues'' was the phone call in the middle of the night that the world doesn't want to answer, then ''Daisies of the Galaxy'' is the hotel wake-up call that says your lovely breakfast is ready".{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} He was joined in the studio by Michael Simpson (Dust Brothers), [[Grant-Lee Phillips]] ([[Grant Lee Buffalo]]), and [[Peter Buck]] ([[R.E.M.]]).

The first single, "[[Mr. E's Beautiful Blues]]", was co-written by Simpson. The song was not intended to be on the album, but the record company insisted on its inclusion. Therefore, it is not featured on the track listing but is instead listed as a bonus track, separated from the rest of the album by 20 seconds of silence.

To promote ''Daisies of the Galaxy'' another tour took place across the United States and Europe, as well as their first visit to Australia. This time Eels were transformed into a 6-piece orchestra, including [[Lisa Germano]] and Probyn Gregory. E also played some solo shows, opening for [[Fiona Apple]].

===''Souljacker'' and ''Shootenanny!''===
In 2001, ''[[Souljacker]]'' was released, an album with a heavier feel and more rock-oriented sound than ''Daisies of the Galaxy''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} [[John Parish]], previously of [[PJ Harvey]]'s band, co-wrote most of the songs and played guitar on the album and first part of the tour. After Parish became a father, he was replaced with [[Joe Gore]] for the American leg of the ''Bus Driving, Band Rocking'' Tour.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Koool G Murder played bass and keyboards and joined Eels on tour.

2003 marked the release of the album ''[[Shootenanny!]]''. E now refers to the album as a break from recording the following ''Blinking Lights'' album.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} It was recorded live in the studio in only ten days. "Saturday Morning" was released as a single.

Butch was replaced on drums by Puddin'. In 2003, Eels did another big tour, the ''Tour of Duty''. The live band consisted of E, [[Shon Sullivan|Goldenboy]] (guitar), Koool G Murder (bass) and Puddin (drums).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Later that year, E composed the score for the film ''[[Levity (film)|Levity]]''.

===''Blinking Lights and Other Revelations'' and ''Eels with Strings''===
[[File:The Eels.jpg|alt=Eels performing onstage|thumb|Eels in 2006, back as a rock combo after a string quartet tour]]
Eels' next album, ''[[Blinking Lights and Other Revelations]]'', was released on April 26, 2005; it was the band's first release for new label [[Vagrant Records]]. It is a 33-track double album. Contributions were made by [[Tom Waits]], [[Peter Buck]], [[John Sebastian]] ([[The Lovin' Spoonful]]), Jim Jacobsen, and Butch.

The first tour in support of the ''Blinking Lights'' album, billed as Eels with Strings, featured primarily acoustic guitar-, [[pump organ|organ]]- and piano-based performances by E backed by Allen 'Big Al' Hunter on piano and [[upright bass]]; Jeffrey Lyster (also known as Chet Atkins III or 'The Chet') on guitar, [[mandolin]], [[pedal steel]], [[musical saw]] and drums; and the string quartet of [[violin]]ists Paloma Udovic and Julie Carpenter, [[viola|violist]] Heather Lockie and [[cello|cellist]] [[Ana Lenchantin]]. The tour resulted in a live album, ''[[Eels with Strings: Live at Town Hall]]'', recorded in New York City. The performance includes tracks from all of their albums, and was released on CD and DVD on February 21, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/60337/eels-get-tangled-in-strings-on-live-cddvd|title=Eels Get Tangled In Strings On Live CD/DVD|access-date=2005-12-15}}</ref>

===''Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I'' and ''Useless Trinkets''===
In early 2008 Eels released their first "greatest hits" compilation as well as a compilation of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], rarities, soundtrack singles and unreleased tracks. ''[[Meet the Eels: Essential Eels Vol. I]]'' spans the first decade of the Eels with singles from all their albums. Attached is a DVD featuring music videos and one live performance video. ''[[Useless Trinkets]]'' contains 50 B-sides and rarities and a DVD of their Lollapalooza 2006 performances. To promote those releases the band went on world tour ("An Evening with Eels"). This time only The Chet joined E on stage, both playing a broad cross-section from the Eels repertoire on a variety of instruments.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The concerts also featured The Chet reading excerpts from E's autobiography, ''[[Things the Grandchildren Should Know]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} On this tour, the band released a live CD/DVD package of Eels' 2006 performance at the ''[[London Astoria]]'' – ''[[Live and in Person!]]''), documenting a show from the second tour in support of ''Blinking Lights and Other Revelations''.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The soundtrack of the 2008 Jim Carrey comedy film ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' features nine songs by the Eels, including "Man Up", a brand new song.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/node/147621 |title = Zooey Deschanel, Eels Affirm ''Yes Man'' Soundtrack |publisher = Pitchfork Media |date = 2008-11-21 |access-date = 2008-12-23 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20081225232353/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/node/147621 |archive-date = 2008-12-25 }}</ref>

[[File:Eels salzburg 5.jpg|alt=The band onstage|thumb|Eels in 2011]]
''[[Hombre Lobo]],'' the seventh Eels studio album, was released on June 2, 2009.
