'''Drab Majesty''' is an American, Los Angeles-based musical project, founded by musician Deb Demure (Andrew Clinco) while working as the drummer for the band [[Marriages (band)|Marriages]], in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/r3zk9v/drab-majesty-deb-demure|title=Drab Majesty's Deb Demure Wants to Whisk You Off to an Icy Dreamland Where Gender Doesn't Matter|date=23 June 2015|website=Noisey.vice.com}}</ref> The project's first record was the 2012 EP ''Unarian Dances'', first self-released and then re-released in 2014 on Lolipop Records.<ref name="Freak">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/drab-majesty-is-las-most-glamorous-freak-5079953|title=Drab Majesty Is L.A.'s Most Glamorous Freak|first=Art|last=Tavana|date=3 October 2014|website=Laweekly.com}}</ref> Since signing to [[Dais Records]], Drab Majesty has released three albums - ''Careless'' (2015),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/stream-drab-majestys-new-album-the-demonstration/|title=stream Drab Majesty’s new album ‘The Demonstration’|website=Brooklynvegan.com}}</ref>''The Demonstration'' (2017),<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dan|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/arts_and_entertainment/the-end-is-here-the-rise-of-l-a-s/article_afb0fd4a-c64d-11e7-a058-1b82e9826b7d.html|title=The End Is Here: The Rise of L.A.'s Drab Majesty|publisher=Los Angeles Downtown News}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/featured/101-best-songs-of-2017/|title=The 101 Best Songs of 2017|date=20 December 2017|website=Spin.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kjhk.org/web/2017/03/14/drab-majesty-the-demonstration/|title=Drab Majesty: The Demonstration|website=Kjnk.org|date=March 14, 2017}}</ref> and ''Modern Mirror'' (2019).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://drabmajesty.bandcamp.com/album/modern-mirror|title=Modern Mirror, by DRAB MAJESTY|website=Drabmajesty.bandcamp.com|accessdate=August 14, 2019}}</ref>

Drab Majesty combine androgynous aesthetics and commanding vocals with futuristic and occult lyrics, a style Demure refers to as, "tragic wave." To create his imposing stage presence, Demure  employs costumes, makeup and props to accompany his lush, '80s-influenced soundscapes. Since 2016, when performing live, Demure is joined onstage by keyboardist and vocalist Mona D (Alex Nicolaou).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/drab-majesty-funeral-playlist|title=This is what Drab Majesty would play at their funeral|website=Interviewmagazine.com|date=November 3, 2017}}</ref>

==History==
{{Tone|section|date=February 2018}}
The idea for Drab Majesty had come to Andrew Clinco in 2011 while drumming for the Los Angeles-based group [[Marriages (band)|Marriages]]. Interested in creating music where he performed all of the instruments himself, Clinco wrote and recorded several songs alone in his bedroom. Clinco stated that he felt some sense of alarm while playing back the music he had recorded, claiming that it was as if another person had made it. "Listening back I just didn’t feel like I was listening to myself [...] It sounded like someone else". This experience provided the inspiration for Clinco to create his alter ego, Deb Demure.<ref name="Noisey2015">{{cite web|last1=Bennett|first1=J|title=Drab Majesty's Deb Demure Wants to Whisk You Off to an Icy Dreamland Where Gender Doesn't Matter (23 June 2015)|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/r3zk9v/drab-majesty-deb-demure|publisher=[[Vice Media|Vice]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>

Drab Majesty's first effort, the [[Extended play|EP]] ''Unarian Dances'', was self-released in 2012.  Initially limited to 100 cassette copies, the EP was later picked up and released by Lollipop Records.<ref name="Dais">{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty|url=https://www.daisrecords.com/collections/drab-majesty|website=Dais Records|publisher=[[Dais Records]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The record's title was inspired by the [[Unarius Academy of Science|Unarian Academy]], a [[UFO]] cult whose appearances on [[public-access television]] Demure described as being "intoxicating".<ref name="Noisey2015" /> The EP, which features some contributions from [[Emma Ruth Rundle]], was described as a "space-age pastiche" and likened to the work of bands such as [[Slowdive]].<ref name="Freak" />

Drab Majesty signed with Dais Records in Spring of 2015<ref name="Careless">{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty - Careless LP|url=https://www.daisrecords.com/products/drab-majesty-careless|website=Dais Records|publisher=[[Dais Records]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> and shortly thereafter released the single "Unknown to the I", which had been described as a "[[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] take on the 80s".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Purdum|first1=Grant|title=Drab Majesty - Unknown to the I [Cassingle; Dais] (4 August 2015)|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/cerberus/drab-majesty-unknown-i|website=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> ''Careless'', Drab Majesty's first full-length album, was released later that year. Recorded at Demure's home studio over the course of 2 years,<ref name="Careless" /> ''Careless'' was inspired by a song a close friend of Demure's had written. "It [the song] affected me really deeply, so I wanted to make a record that was a nod to [my friend]".<ref name="Noisey2015" /> The album features what was described by [[Tiny Mix Tapes]] writer Grant Purdum as "mechanical beats, isolated ruminations, and stimulating guitar arpeggios that equate to more than the sum of their parts".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Purdum|first1=Grant|title=Drab Majesty - Careless [LP; Dais] (10 December 2015)|url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/cerberus/drab-majesty-careless|website=Tiny Mix Tapes|publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> Drab Majesty toured with Dais cohorts King Dude later that year. [[Westword]] contributor Tom Murphy described Drab Majesty's stage show as "more than just a rock show" and likened Demure to an "unconventional religious figure".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Murphy|first1=Tom|title=Deb Demure of Drab Majesty Opens Ears and Minds at Larimer Lounge (27 October 2015)|url=http://www.westword.com/music/deb-demure-of-drab-majesty-opens-ears-and-minds-at-larimer-lounge-7258831|website=[[Westword]]|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The following year, Dais Records re-released the album with extra tracks featuring all studio material released thus far as a compilation titled ''Completely Careless''. It consisted of all tracks from debut album ''Careless'', plus the two B-sides from the "Unknown to the I" single, the five tracks of the ''Unarian Dances'' limited edition EP, new tracks "Waiting Game" and "Silhouette", and a remix of "The Foyer".

In 2016, Drab Majesty expanded into a duo with the addition of keyboardist Mona D.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty - The Demonstration|url=https://www.daisrecords.com/collections/drab-majesty/products/drab-majesty-the-demonstration|website=[[Dais Records]]|publisher=Dais Records|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The son of horror director [[Ted Nicolaou]], Mona D helped to enhance the group's theatrics while touring North America and Europe in 2016.<ref name="auto" /> ''The Demonstration'', Drab Majesty's second studio album, was released in January 2017 to favorable reviews. ''The Demonstration'' is a concept album that deals with the psychology of [[mass suicide]], referencing in particular the ideology of [[Marshall Applewhite]], the leader of the [[Heaven's Gate cult]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultmtl.com/2017/01/drab-majesty/|title=Drab Majesty's divinely inspired tragic-wave music|date=17 January 2017|website=Cultmtl.com|accessdate=20 November 2020}}</ref> Zaina Abujebarah of [[SLUG Magazine]] called ''The Demonstration'' a "perfect" album that "transcends the glamour of nightlife and illustrates the complexities of feeling blue".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Abujebarah|first1=Zaina|title='Drab Majesty - The Demonstration' review (31 January 2017)|url=https://www.slugmag.com/national-music-reviews/drab-majesty-demonstration/|website=[[SLUG Magazine]]|publisher=SLUG Magazine|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> Susana Meza of ''The Spill Magazine'' gave the album a 9 out of 10, saying that the album was "a phenomenal record by exceptional performers and quite the proper introduction to Drab Majesty for the uninitiated".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Meza|first1=Susana|title=Spill Album Review: Drab Majesty - The Demonstration|url=http://spillmagazine.com/spill-album-review-drab-majesty-demonstration/|website=The Spill Magazine|publisher=The Spill Magazine|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> CVLT Nation said that the album was "more than everything you dreamed it would be" and called it "a blend of postpunk vocals, sophisticated lyrics, ethereal synth sound, and shoegaze influence". The duo toured North America with Dais counterparts [[Cold Cave]], and later toured Europe alongside King Dude, with whom they collaborated on the single "Who Taught You How to Love?" the year before.<ref name="CVLT">{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty’s Highly Anticipated Sophomore LP “The Demonstration” Review (16 January 2017)|url=http://www.cvltnation.com/drab-majestys-highly-anticipated-sophomore-lp-demonstration-review/|website=CVLT Nation|publisher=CVLT Nation|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>

In late 2017, the duo released a 7-inch single, titled "Oakwood", for the 10th anniversary celebration of Dais Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty Honors the Memory of Cash Askew in New Song 'Oak Wood' (1 September 2017)|url=http://www.post-punk.com/drab-majesty-honors-the-memory-of-cash-askew-in-new-song-oak-wood/|website=Post-punk.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The song was written in honor of Cash Askew, co-founder of the band [[Them Are Us Too]], who died in the [[2016 Oakland warehouse fire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Them Are Us Too Co-Founder Cash Askew Among Dead in Oakland Warehouse Fire (4 December 2016)|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/7597401/them-are-us-too-cash-askew-dead-oakland-fire|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Billboard|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The title "Oakwood", according to Demure, is a direct translation of Askew's name.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty Releases 'Oak Wood'; Embarks on Expansive North American Tour (1 September 2017)|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Drab-Majesty-Releases-Oak-Wood-Embarks-on-Expansive-North-American-Tour-20170901|website=BroardwayWorld|publisher=Wisdom Digital Media|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The single featured a B-side called "Egress", an instrumental guitar piece.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chandler|first1=Anna|title=Drab Majesty, Boy Harsher, Pyramid Club @The Jinx (13 September 2017)|url=https://www.connectsavannah.com/savannah/drab-majesty-boy-harsher-pyramid-club-the-jinx/Content?oid=5595128|website=[[Connect Savannah]]|publisher=Connect Savannah|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> The duo embarked on their North American ''Fall From the Sky'' tour in September;<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marotta|first1=Michael|title=Live Demonstration: Drab Majesty Announce North American Tour (23 June 2017)|url=http://www.vanyaland.com/2017/06/23/live-demonstration-drab-majesty-announce-north-american-tour/|website=Vanyaland|publisher=Vanyaland|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> the tour included a stop at the 2017 Cold Waves Festival in Chicago.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pettigrew|first1=Jason|title=Cold Waves Festival Jumpstarts the Fury of Industrial-Rock (8 November 2017)|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/entry/cold_waves_festival_interview|website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|publisher=Alternative Press|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref> They extended their tour to Europe in Winter of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Drab Majesty perform ‘Dot In The Sky’ and ‘Not Just A Name’ live at the Museum of Surgical Science (8 December 2017)|url=http://www.post-punk.com/drab-majesty-perform-dot-in-the-sky-and-not-just-a-name-live-at-the-museum-of-surgical-science/|website=Post-punk.com|accessdate=20 February 2018}}</ref>
