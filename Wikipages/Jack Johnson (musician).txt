==Early life==
The son of well-known surfer Jeffery Johnson, Jack was born and raised on the North Shore of [[Oahu]], [[Hawaii]].<ref name="AOL biography">{{cite web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429171313/http://music.aol.com/artist/jack-johnson/biography |archive-date=April 29, 2012 |url-status=dead |url=http://music.aol.com/artist/jack-johnson/biography |title=Jack Johnson Biography |publisher=Music.aol.com |access-date=December 6, 2015}}</ref> He began to learn how to surf at the age of 5. At 17, he became the youngest invitee to make the finals of the [[Billabong Pipeline Masters|Pipeline Masters]], one of surfing's most prestigious events, on Oahu's [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]]. One week later, however, his stint as a professional surfer ended when he suffered a surfing accident at the [[Banzai Pipeline|Pipeline]] that put more than 100 stitches in his forehead and removed a few of his teeth; this later became the inspiration for the song "Drink the Water".<ref name="interviews">{{cite web|url= http://geocities.com/jackjohnsononline/interviews.htm|title=Jack Johnson Interviews|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091026224929/http://geocities.com/jackjohnsononline/interviews.htm|archive-date=October 26, 2009|url-status=dead|access-date=February 21, 2013}}</ref><!--- Bottom of page, Chicago Tribune Article ---><ref name="the dude abides">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/18684236/cover_story_jack_johnson__the_dude_abides|title=Cover Story: Jack Johnson – The Dude Abides |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724202220/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/18684236/cover_story_jack_johnson__the_dude_abides|archive-date=July 24, 2009|url-status=dead}}<br />Also at: {{closed access}} {{cite web|url= http://archive.rollingstone.com/Desktop?s=2008030675#/20080306/41|title=Jack Johnson – The Dude Abides|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 5, 2008}} {{subscription required}}</ref> He appeared as a surfer in ''[[The Endless Summer II]]'' in 1994.<ref name=EndlessSummer2>{{cite web | title = The Endless Summer 2 (1994): cast and crew | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0109729/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm | work = [[IMDb]] | access-date = December 22, 2017}}</ref>

==Career==
[[Image:Bonnaroo08 jackjohnson2 lg.jpg|thumb|right|245px|Johnson performing in 2005.]]

===2000–03: ''Brushfire Fairytales'' and ''On and On''===
Jack Johnson's big break was writing and contributing vocals for the song "Rodeo Clowns" which was featured on [[G. Love & Special Sauce|G. Love's]] 1999 album ''[[Philadelphonic]]''. The song would later become the most famous single on the album. Johnson was introduced to G. Love by a mutual friend of Johnson who was shooting surf films with him at the time. After hearing "Rodeo Clowns", G. Love saw Johnson's potential and effortless style and invited him to record with him. That led to the now-famous "Rodeo Clowns" recording, launching Johnson's career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://maryjaneexperience.com/garrett-dutton-aka-g-love-of-g-love-and-special-sauce-shares-cannabis-stories/|title=Garrett Dutton AKA G.Love (of G.Love and Special Sauce) Shares Cannabis Stories|website=Maryjaneexperience.com|date=March 5, 2020|access-date=April 3, 2020}}</ref>

In addition to his later success as a musician, Johnson is also an accomplished filmmaker. Johnson directed the surf films ''[[Thicker than Water (2000 film)|Thicker Than Water]]'' (2000) and ''[[The September Sessions]]'' (2002), in which he also starred. Both movie soundtracks were also products of Johnson. Johnson also starred in the 2004 surf film ''[[A Brokedown Melody]]''.

Suela released a four track demo that caught the attention of [[Ben Harper]]'s producer, J. P. Plunier, who worked with Johnson to produce his debut album ''[[Brushfire Fairytales]]'' during December 2000 with Harper and his [[Weissenborn]] lap [[steel guitar]] making a guest appearance.<ref name="interviews"/><!--- 91x San Diego Radio Interview Transcript ---><ref>{{cite news|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Apr/21/en/FP604210305.html |title=Harper takes both sides &#124; The Honolulu Advertiser &#124; Hawaii's Newspaper |newspaper=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=April 21, 2006 |access-date=September 7, 2015}}</ref> ''Brushfire Fairytales'' was released on February 1, 2001, and led to Johnson becoming the opening act in late February 2001 for the last twenty-three cities of Ben Harper's "Innocent Criminals" tour of the United States.<ref name="interviews"/><!--- Article by Dori Levy: Jack Johnson’s music makes impact at D.P.

Johnson went back into the studio with Adam Topol (drums, percussion) and Merlo Podlewski (bass), who played on ''[[Brushfire Fairytales]]'', and [[Mario Caldato Jr]] on production duties, to record his second full-length album ''[[On and On (Jack Johnson album)|On and On]]''. It was the first album to be recorded at Johnson's Mango Tree Studio in Johnson's home town of [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore, Oahu]], and the first to be released through The Moonshine Conspiracy Records. ''On and On'' was released on May 6, 2003.

The Moonshine Conspiracy Records was later changed to Brushfire Records; Johnson turned the offices and studios of his Los-Angeles based record company into a model of eco-friendliness, with solar power, recyclable CD packaging, and power-saving air conditioners.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Serpick|first1=Evan|title=Rock & Roll: Tours – Tour Industry's Green Revolution|journal=Rolling Stones|date=June 14, 2007|issue=1028|pages=13–14}}</ref>

In October 2004, Johnson returned to the Mango Tree Studio with Topol and Podlewski along with [[Zach Gill]] (of [[Animal Liberation Orchestra]]) playing accordion, melodica and piano, to record his follow-up to 2003's ''On and On''. ''[[In Between Dreams]]'' was released on March 1, 2005.

''[[Sing-A-Longs and Lullabies for the Film Curious George]]'' is a soundtrack album by Johnson, released on February 7, 2006. The album also features [[Ben Harper]], [[G. Love]], Merlo Podlewski and Zach Gill. It was the first soundtrack to make it to [[List of number-one albums of 2006 (U.S.)|number 1]] since the ''[[Bad Boys II (soundtrack)|Bad Boys II soundtrack]]'' in August 2003, and was the first soundtrack for an animated film to top the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] since the ''[[Pocahontas (soundtrack)|Pocahontas soundtrack]]'' in July 1995.

Johnson enlisted J.P. Plunier to produce his fourth full-length studio album, ''[[Sleep Through the Static]]''. It was recorded using 100% solar energy at the Solar-Powered Plastic Plant studio in Los Angeles. The album featured Gill (keys), Podlewski (bass) and Topol (drums, percussion). ''Sleep Through the Static'' was released on February 1, 2008, and was followed by a world tour.

A live album and DVD of Johnson's 2008 world tour, entitled ''[[En Concert (Jack Johnson album)|En Concert]]'', was released on October 27, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brushfirerecords.com/home/archive/jack_johnson_en_concert |title=Jack Johnson En Concert – Brushfire Records |publisher=Brushfirerecords.com |date=July 8, 2009 |access-date=September 22, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206101817/http://www.brushfirerecords.com/home/archive/jack_johnson_en_concert/ |archive-date=December 6, 2010  }}</ref> The DVD was directed by Emmett Malloy.

Johnson lives on the [[North Shore (Oahu)|North Shore]] of the island of [[Oahu]] in Hawaii. In an interview with Johnson, [[Ann Donahue]] from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' described Johnson's family life by saying "There is often trouble in balancing the life of an artist, environmentalist, and family man, but Johnson seems to have the niche for such a challenge. This time around, he's found a pace that agrees with him...bringing his family along so he can spend mornings with them sightseeing."<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Donahue | first1 = Ann | year = 2010 | title = YOU DON'T KNOW JACK JOHNSON | journal = Billboard | volume = 122 | issue = 19| pages = 12–14 }}</ref> Both Johnson and his wife decline to talk about or release any intimate information concerning their children.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.mensjournal.com/jack-johnson|title=It Ain't Easy Being This Mellow|magazine=[[Men's Journal]]|date=June 30, 2008|access-date=August 30, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520130336/http://www.mensjournal.com/jack-johnson|archive-date=May 20, 2012}}</ref>

==Charity==
In 2008, Johnson and his wife Kim created the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation, a non-profit public charity supporting environmental, art, and music education worldwide. Jack and Kim Johnson also founded the Kokua Hawaii Foundation in 2003. Johnson and his family work hard every year at festivals and concerts alike, to raise money for causes they feel are most important. Johnson recorded a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]" for the 2007 benefit album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'', which was also included on the 2009 benefit album ''[[Rhythms del Mundo Classics]]''. In talking about Johnson and his career choices, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' wrote: "It is a typically generous move from Johnson, who has used his multi-platinum success to support causes he cares about." Although the Johnson Ohana Charitable Foundation is a non-profit organization that "focuses on environmental, arts and music education", it has raised more than $750,000 from 2009 to 2010 to give away.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Edwards | first1 = Gavin | year = 2010 | title = Jack Johnson's L. A. Beach Party | journal = [[Rolling Stone]] | volume = 1107 | page = 19 }}</ref> Johnson was in [[Osaka]], Japan on his To the Sea 2010 World Tour at the time of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] in northern Japan. He was in a hotel with his family when it struck. After having to postpone the rest of his tour, he donated $50,000 to [[GlobalGiving]]'s Japan Earthquake and Tsunami Relief Fund.

Johnson's Ohana Charitable Foundation has also supported Little Kids Rock, a national nonprofit that works to restore and revitalize music education in disadvantaged U.S. public schools. He also decorated a guitar for Little Kids Rock to auction to raise funds for its program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/jack-johnson/|title=Jack Johnson|publisher=Little Kids Rock|access-date=January 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114081022/http://www.littlekidsrock.org/friends/our-big-fans/jack-johnson/|archive-date=January 14, 2014}}</ref>

On September 22, 2012, he donated his time to play a few songs at Farm Aid 2012 in Hershey, PA. Later in 2012, Jack donated $50,000 for [[Hurricane Sandy]] relief and added links on his website for others to donate:

{{cquote|After years of touring and surfing along the East Coast, I have made so many great friends. It is heartbreaking to see the images and hear their stories.
