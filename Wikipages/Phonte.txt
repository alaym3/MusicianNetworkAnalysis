He has also recorded [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-flavored output as a singer (often under the pseudonym '''Percy Miracles'''), and with Nicolay on The Foreign Exchange. His rhymes tend to be no-frill perspectives on working-class life.<ref name=mvremix>{{cite web|url=http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/littlebrother.shtml|title=MVRemix Urban Interviews Phonte of Little Brother – Online Rap Magazine|website=Mvremix.com|access-date=September 16, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==

===Little Brother===
{{main|Little Brother (group)}}
Phonte first met the other members of Little Brother, [[Rapper Big Pooh]] and [[9th Wonder]], in 1998 while attending [[North Carolina Central University]], as an [[English major]].<ref name=mvremix /> The three shared common musical interests and decided to form a group. "Speed", the group's first song recorded together, led to them signing a deal with the independent ABB Records, and recording their debut album, ''[[The Listening (Little Brother album)|The Listening]]''. The album's success led to the group signing a non-exclusive deal with major label [[Atlantic Records]].

The group's 2005 album, ''[[The Minstrel Show]]'', was a concept album dealing with the current state of hip hop music. The album received a positive critical reaction but very little commercial success. During the recording of their third album, the group announced the departure of producer 9th Wonder on amicable terms, as well as a parting of ways with their label. Through a contractual clause they landed back on ABB Records and released ''[[Getback]]'' in late 2007.

===The Foreign Exchange===
Phonte "met" (virtually) Dutch producer [[Nicolay (musician)|Nicolay]] on an OkayPlayer message board. The two released their debut album, ''[[Connected (The Foreign Exchange album)|Connected]]'', having never met face to face.  The Foreign Exchange has released four albums and has garnered a Grammy nomination for Best Urban/Alternative Performance for the track "Daykeeper" (feat. Muhsinah) off of the second album, ''[[Leave It All Behind (album)|Leave It All Behind]]''.

===Solo work===
Phonte has appeared on numerous records by other artists, often as a vocalist. He made a guest appearance on the song "Beats N' Rhymes" from producer [[Kev Brown]]'s album "I Do What I Do", and has also recorded tracked with producer Oddisee, both members of the Washington D.C. (DMV)-based [[Low Budget (collective)|Low Budget collective]]. In 2006, he was featured on producer [[DJ Shadow]]'s ''[[The Outsider (DJ Shadow album)|The Outsider]]'' album. In the following year he contributed vocals to rap group [[Playaz Circle]]'s "Paper Chaser", from their album ''[[Supply & Demand (Playaz Circle album)|Supply & Demand]]''. Phonte's recent projects include The Foreign Exchange's third album, ''[[Authenticity (Foreign Exchange album)|Authenticity]]'', as well as a collaboration (as Tiggalo) with Detroit-based musician Zo! titled '' Zo! & Tigallo Love the 80s''. The latter of these is intended as an homage to early 1980s [[R&B]] and pop music and features covers of popular songs such as [[a-Ha]]'s "[[Take On Me]]", [[Toto (band)|Toto]]'s "[[Africa (Toto song)|Africa]]", and [[Joe Jackson (musician)|Joe Jackson]]'s "[[Steppin' Out (Joe Jackson song)|Stepping Out]]". He appeared on [[RJD2]]'s 2013 album ''[[More Is Than Isn't]]''.

He released his solo-debut titled "Charity Starts at Home" on September 27, 2011 through FE Music.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=phontigallo|author=Phonte|number=65995548016123904|date=May 5, 2011|title=Phonte.
