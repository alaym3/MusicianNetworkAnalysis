'''Aron Erlichman''' (born March 2, 1983), better known by his stage name '''Deuce'''), is an American rapper, [[music producer]] and [[guitarist]]. Brought to fame as a producer, singer-songwriter and one of the founding members of [[rap rock]] band [[Hollywood Undead]], Deuce departed from [[Hollywood Undead]] in 2010 and has since moved on to solo work through the label "Five Seven Music", a branch of [[Eleven Seven Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/label/Five+Seven+Music/a/Five+Seven+Music |title=Five Seven Music Records |publisher=Cduniverse.com |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> He was formerly involved in a movement with fellow rapper Truth (Vardan Aslanyan) called "Nine Lives" (often stylized as both "9LIVES" and "IX LIVES").

==History==

===Musical beginnings (2005)===
Deuce began creating [[Rock music|rock]]-based music under his birth name of Aron Erlichman, early in 2005. In 2005, he released four tracks—"Franny", "Surface Air", "Breaking Through", and "Sometimes"—from his first EP called '' The Aron EP'' on ''Broadjam'', an Internet sharing site. He later co-founded [[Hollywood Undead]] with Jorel Decker and Jeff Phillips, and sang [[clean vocals]] and produced instrumentals for the band, until his departure from the band in early 2010. In early February 2012, three more pre-Hollywood Undead tracks were released and surfaced, including "Far Away", "Fallen Stone", and "Dreams".<ref name="Aron Erlichman's old broadjam profile from 2005">{{cite web|title=Aron Erlichman's Songs|url=http://www.broadjam.com/artists/songs.php?artistID=19171|work=broadjam.com|publisher=Aron Erlichman|access-date=October 21, 2013}}</ref>

===Hollywood Undead (2005–2010)===
{{Main|Hollywood Undead}}
Deuce co-founded the band [[Hollywood Undead]] as a vocalist and producer with close friend Jorel Decker (J-Dog). The band began their musical career with the creation of the rap-rock song "The Kids", which was greatly promoted by [[Jeffree Star]]. Deuce initially adopted and recorded songs with the band under the pseudonym "Tha Producer" due to his role in production but shortened this pseudonym to "Tha Prodeuca" and then "Deuce" not long after.<ref name="An Interview with Deuce">{{cite web|url=http://www.lithiummagazine.com/interview-deuce-%E2%80%93-feb-9-2012|publisher=Lithium Magazoine|author=Jamie Bertolini|title=An Interview with Deuce|date=February 9, 2012|access-date=February 18, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220064301/http://lithiummagazine.com/interview-deuce-%E2%80%93-feb-9-2012|archive-date=February 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name="Interview With Hollywood Undead">{{cite web|url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/090702|publisher=Shave Magazine|author=Ziyah Karmali|title=Interview With Hollywood Undead|date=July 2, 2009|access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref> At the time of Deuce's departure, Hollywood Undead had gained success with ''[[Swan Songs (Hollywood Undead album)|Swan Songs]]'', which peaked at number 22 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' 200]] in its first week.<ref name="Swan Songs Billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hollywood undead|chart=all}}|publisher=Billboard|title=Swan Songs&nbsp;– Hollywood Undead|date=September 20, 2008|access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref> A few EPs were released, the ''[[Swan Songs B-Sides EP]]'' and the ''[[Swan Songs Rarities EP]]'' in 2009 and 2010, respectively. In 2009, Hollywood Undead released their first live album, ''[[Desperate Measures (Hollywood Undead album)|Desperate Measures]]'', which peaked at number 29 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Desperate Measures Billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hollywood undead|chart=all}}|publisher=Billboard|title=Desperate Measures&nbsp;– Hollywood Undead|date=November 28, 2009|access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref>

In late 2009, Deuce left Hollywood Undead, due to differences within the band members.

The first song he wrote following his departure was a song titled "Story of a Snitch" about Hollywood Undead, the 'snitch' allegedly being about Hollywood Undead member J-Dog, with the lyrics consisting mainly of obscenities and insults directed towards Hollywood Undead, also making claims such as he was kicked out of the band and that members of the band were "tryin' to spit just like me [Deuce] but they don't have it".<ref name="Information regarding &quot;Story of a Snitch&quot;.">{{cite web|title=Hollywood Undead vs DEUCE!!

In an interview with YouTube interviewer Bryan Stars, Hollywood Undead members Johnny 3 Tears and Da Kurlzz were asked why Deuce had left the band, revealing that he was not working well with the band and that they had to "''bend over backwards to accommodate Deuce in a lot of ways...''" and also that he held them back on their song writing quality."<ref name="Hollywood Undead discusses Deuce's departure with Bryan Stars">{{cite web|title=Hollywood Undead discusses Deuce's departure|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/hollywood_undead_responds_to_deuces_departure_from_the_band|work=AltPress|publisher=Tyler Common|access-date=November 12, 2013|format=Video interview|date=February 13, 2011|quote=In a recent YouTube interview the band speak on the situation which can be seen below...|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216122343/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/hollywood_undead_responds_to_deuces_departure_from_the_band/|archive-date=February 16, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Deuce in a different interview with Bryan Stars however stated that the band were in fact jealous of his leading role in the band and that he was fully responsible for the band's current position. Also, Hollywood Undead stated that Deuce required a personal assistant, revealed to be Jimmy Yuma, now Deuce's guitarist and lyricist, and Yuma replied that Deuce paid him himself, not the band, to set equipment up and to tour with him; the confusion was that the band also paid him to set up ''their'' equipment separately. Deuce also commented that on one tour, the band was waiting for him in order to fly to their next destination and blamed it on Deuce for being late; however Deuce had stated that the manager told him that the band had broken up and was not touring.<ref name="Deuce responds to Hollywood Undead interview.">{{cite web|title=Deuce Responds Hollywood Undead New Interview 9Lives 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNf2-dW_5es|work=YouTube|publisher=Bryan Stars|access-date=November 12, 2013|format=Video|date=April 30, 2012}}</ref>

During an interview with JackedUp Radio, Deuce states that one of the disputes he had with Hollywood Undead was over having a personal Twitter account; Deuce claims that when he began to connect with fans over Twitter he was told that "if you keep twittering, you're not going to be allowed to go on tour".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tindeck.com/listen/ywjj |title=JackedUp - 1st Deuce Interview Uncensored - Tindeck MP3 Download |publisher=Tindeck.com |date=December 27, 2010 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>

Upon signing with [[A&M/Octone]] with [[Hollywood Undead]] in 2008, Deuce states that he was also signed as a solo artist. He released his first four-track EP, ''The Two Thousand Eight EP'', which contained songs "[[The One (Deuce Song)|The One]]", "Gravestone", "Hollyhood Vacation" (featuring Truth) and "Deuce Dot Com", all of which would four years later be remastered and released within his début album, the latter of the two being bonus tracks. The EP was released through iTunes and received little success. Shortly after Deuce was evicted from the band, the EP disappeared from iTunes. Deuce accused the label of breaching the original contract terms and later sued the company under this accusation. Deuce discovered a loophole that revealed he was permitted to produce remixes and mixtape-style songs using the instrumentals of other musicians, so long as he did not incur a profit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tindeck.com/dl/ywjj |title=Track Download - Tindeck MP3 Download |publisher=Tindeck.com |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>

===''The Call Me Big Deuce'' EP (2010–2011)===
In September 2010, Deuce made his first official live performance as a solo artist at [[California]]'s [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter]] music festival, opening for [[Eminem]], [[Blink-182]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], [[Rise Against]], and others.<ref name="Deuce of Hollywood Undead Announces Epicenter 2010 Solo Performance">{{cite web|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/news/deuce-of-hollywood-undead-announces-epicenter-2010-solo-performance|publisher=Pure Grain Audio|author=Spencer Matulaitis|title=Deuce of Hollywood Undead Announces Epicenter 2010 Solo Performance|date=July 28, 2010|access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Former Hollywood Undead frontman Deuce Added to Epicenter Twenty Ten">{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/former-hollywood-undead-frontman-deuce-added-to-epicenter-twenty-ten/0dYS9sNaj333a|publisher=Artist Direct|author=Rick Florino|title=Former Hollywood Undead frontman Deuce Added to Epicenter Twenty Ten|date=July 27, 2010|access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2011, ''The Call Me Big Deuce EP'' was released as the first collective release of material by American singer-rapper Deuce as an independent solo-artist. Consisting of 14 previously released songs, the mixtape contains verses over instrumentals by [[50 Cent]], [[Eminem]], [[Tupac Shakur]], [[B.o.B]] and [[Jay-Z]]. The mixtape did not contain the previously released songs "Freaky Now", "Surface Air" and "Now You See My Life", which would later be released with his debut album a year later.

===''Nine Lives'' (2011–2013)===
{{Main|Nine Lives (Deuce album)}}
Deuce completed work for his debut album in late 2011. The album was scheduled to be released March 27, 2012, by [[Five Seven Music]]; however, it was pushed back until April 24, 2012. The album artwork for ''Nine Lives'' was released on February 10 by ''Loudwire'', who also announced that Deuce would be joining artists [[Blood on the Dance Floor (band)|Blood on the Dance Floor]], [[Brokencyde]], [[The Bunny The Bear]], [[William Control]], [[New Years Day (band)|New Years Day]], [[Polkadot Cadaver]], and Haley Rose on the Fight To Unite Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/deuce-unveils-nine-lives-album-cover-new-release-date-tour-plans/ |title=Deuce Unveils 'Nine Lives' Album Cover, New Release Date and Tour Plans |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=February 10, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>

The lead single, "Let's Get It Crackin'", was released November 28, 2011, with an accompanying music video and features [[Jeffree Star]].<ref name="DEUCE">{{cite web|url=http://puregrainaudio.com/news/deuce-premieres-let-s-get-it-crackin-music-video-online|publisher=Pure Grain Audio|author=Chee Kam|title=DEUCE Premieres "Let's Get It Crackin'" Music Video Online|date=November 29, 2011|access-date=November 30, 2011}}</ref> The album's second single, "[[America (Deuce song)|America]]", was initially set to be released for January 2012,<ref>{{cite web|title=America on itunes plus video in January|url=https://www.facebook.com/DeuceLA/posts/296621867047844|work=Facebook|publisher=Deuce|access-date=November 12, 2013|format=Facebook post|date=December 21, 2011|quote=America on itunes plus video on the 17 January, are you guys excited?}}</ref> but was released a week early on January 10<ref name="America music video released early">{{cite web|title=New music video for America out now!|url=https://www.facebook.com/DeuceLA/posts/343130495714595|work=Facebook|publisher=Deuce|format=Facebook Post|date=January 10, 2012|quote=Check out the new America video now}}</ref> due to a leak of the full music video in December 2011.<ref name="an example of the America music video, uploaded before its original release date.">{{cite web|title=Deuce - America music video leak|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUpf_0T5DK0|work=YouTube|publisher=Raslanov Al-MuFleh|access-date=November 12, 2013|format=Video|date=December 30, 2011}}</ref> Deuce commented on the album saying, "This album has that signature Deuce sound and is similar in flavor to what I created on ''Swan Songs'', but completely unrestricted and rated NC-17. I took some of the shit I couldn't get away with on ''Swan Songs'' and brought it to another level for ''Nine Lives''. If you liked what I did before, you will love this...". The album's third and final single before release was titled "Help Me". The song makes fun of the music industry as a whole and particularly [[James Diener]] of A&M/Octone. The song was finally released on March 27.<ref name="Help Me on iTunes">{{cite web|title=Help Me on iTunes|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/help-me-single/id511134369|work=iTunes|publisher=Deuce|access-date=November 10, 2013}}</ref>

In an interview by [[Gibson]] guitars, Deuce talked about the inspiration of his single "America". "I was just going through a weird time, and I was really down. Then I said, 'I don't care how bad my life is, I'm just going to accept it and use it to my advantage.".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/deuce-interview-0223-2012/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130124052559/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/deuce-interview-0223-2012/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 24, 2013 |title=Deuce Talks Hollywood Undead, Nine Lives and the Art of Songwriting |publisher=Gibson.com |date=February 23, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2013 }}</ref> When comparing ''Nine Lives'' to ''Swan Songs'', Deuce said "It's not like last time where there were so many people, now it's all Deuce. Before it was people who weren't producers and not song-writers trying to change things, and now it's just Deuce and I can do exactly what I want."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indulge-sound.com/2012/05/04/interview-deuce/ |title=Interview: Deuce. |publisher=Indulge-Sound .com |date=September 9, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>

''Nine Lives'' ended up selling 11,425 copies in the United States during its first week, peaking at number 37 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

A remix EP, titled ''Deuce REMIXXXED'', was released on May 5, 2012, with remixes of both "America" and "Let's Get It Crackin'".<ref name="Deuce REMIXXXED on Deuce's Soundcloud account">{{cite web|title=Deuce REMIXXXED|url=https://soundcloud.com/deuce9lives/sets/deuce-remix|work=Soundcloud|publisher=deuce9lives|access-date=November 12, 2013|format=Music|date=May 5, 2013|quote=Compilation of winners from the Deuce Remix Contest!}}</ref> On July 3, a single was released for Independence Day which was called the "[[America(n) Pride]]", which contained "America", two remixes, and the music video on iTunes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/america-n-pride-single/id539661631 |title=iTunes - Music - America(n) Pride - Single by Deuce |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=July 3, 2012 |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> On July 17, 2012, Deuce released a remix of "I Came To Party" with "Rock mix" in parenthesize via his official Twitter account.

Deuce participated on the [[Uproar Festival]] 2012 on the ''Jägermeister'' stage along with [[Redlight King]], [[In This Moment]] and [[Thousand Foot Krutch]]. In 2013, Deuce was awarded "New Artist of the Year" from [[loudwire]], beating [[Tremonti (band)|Tremonti]] and [[Falling in Reverse]].<ref name="Deuce Wins New Artist of the Year In the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards">{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/deuce-new-artist-of-the-year-2012-loudwire-music-awards/|date=January 2013 |title=Deuce Wins New Artist of the Year In the 2012 Loudwire Music Awards |access-date=January 25, 2013}}</ref>

On December 1, 2017, Deuce released ''Invincible.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://search.blabbermouth.net/cdreviews/invincible/|title=Invincible - DEUCE|date=January 6, 2018|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|access-date=March 1, 2021}}</ref> ''Invincible'' in its official form had a different track listing from its older unofficial form.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Invincible (Original) by Deuce|url=https://genius.com/albums/Deuce/Invincible-original|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Invincible by Deuce|url=https://genius.com/albums/Deuce/Invincible|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Genius|language=en}}</ref> Many of the new tracks that comprised the official release were received negatively. To compensate for this, tracks cut from the unofficial version of ''Invincible'' were then released as the ''Nightmare'' EP on March 2, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|date=March 7, 2018|title=Welcome To Deuce's Nightmare|url=http://www.maximumvolumemusic.com/welcome-deuces-nightmare/|access-date=March 1, 2021}}</ref>

=== Arrests and Speculation (2018–2021) ===
Deuce has been near radio silent for many years, only providing small fan interviews<ref>{{Citation|title=Deuce Interview May 25th 2021 [RE-UPLOAD]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UqbKxr0ctog|language=en|access-date=2021-12-02}}</ref> and replying to tweets vaguely promising a new album is in the works<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/deuce9lives/status/1452985118285451267|url=https://twitter.com/deuce9lives/status/1452985118285451267|access-date=2021-12-02|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref>. He hasn't posted a photo of himself online since 2015.

Many fans speculate that Deuce is currently homeless. Former Hollywood Undead bandmate Jeff Phillips also supports the theory.<ref>{{Citation|title=Shady Jeff Explains Why He Took Down His Videos About Deuce|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y42inTSnlvE|language=en|access-date=2021-12-02}}</ref> The theory is supported by the fact that Deuce seems to be forgetful and groggy in the interviews he gives out, sometimes listeners can also hear cars or other outside movements coming from Deuce's phone. Notably, he's also been arrested multiple times since 2018. His charges include aggravated harassment, resisting arrest, assault of a public safety officer, theft, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aron Erlichman Arrested - Clackamas, Oregon Mugshots and Arrest Reports - 2018-10-18|url=http://crimeinformer.com/arrestArticle/132175|access-date=2021-12-02|website=crimeinformer.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=ARON ERLICHMAN {{!}} Arrested on Jan. 01, 2020|url=https://www.jailbase.com/arrested/oregon/clackamas/aron-erlichman-2020950005|access-date=2021-12-02|website=JailBase|language=en}}</ref> From the arrests, his mugshots also show him as looking dirty and less healthy than many older images of Deuce online. He's also consistently been begging fans for money online.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lastrevio|date=2021-11-08|title=Deuce started begging for money. Did anyone else receive such messages? It's quite pathetic tbh. He got homeless and lies that he's working on a new album to get money from his fans.|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/Deuce9lives/comments/qp6vfu/deuce_started_begging_for_money_did_anyone_else/|access-date=2021-12-02|website=r/Deuce9lives}}</ref> But because there is no concrete evidence, this remains a theory.

==Fan base and Nine Lives movement==
Nine Lives was a rap group founded by rappers Serve and Truth. Though it later devolved into Deuce's [[backup band]] and also the name of Deuce' brand name. It has gathered a large community fanbase-following (mainly through social networking sites such as [[Twitter]] and [[Facebook]]). Truth was the C.E.O. of the Nine Lives movement, and ran the company from an office located on Vine, between Hollywood and Franklin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Truth/status/205305477163266048 |title=Twitter / Truth: I am the owner of Nine Lives |publisher=Twitter.com |access-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> Truth has given the term a similar description as Deuce, adding that "Nine Lives" was also a clothing line and brand, partnered with [[American Apparel]]. Deuce used to also be partnered with clothing line "Plrklr".

==Legal issues and controversy==
Deuce filed a lawsuit against the A&M/Octone label claiming a breach of contract. The suit alleged that the label refused to release his solo music because the vulgarity and gang references in the lyrics made the music not commercial enough.<ref name="Fink prefers coach">{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/fink_prefers_coach_HBXQdGUlUHsITfP5eRZA7L|publisher=[[The New York Post]]|author=Claire Atkinson|title=Fink prefers coach|date=February 19, 2011|access-date=November 3, 2011}}</ref> Additionally, it alleged Deuce was forced out of the band by its members and said he feared for his safety after [[anti-Semitic]] slurs were leveled at him, and that a gun was pointed at him by a former band member.<ref name="Fink prefers coach"/> The lawsuit was settled privately in court, the visible results being that Deuce is now able to release music under a new label, as well as keep his stage-name and mask designs. Deuce commented on the legal situation and how it affected him while writing his début album, noting, "It just made me tougher and stronger. Having to write, record and make a whole album during a period of time when your music's being taken down could be hard and a lot of people could lose duration or hope. But I have my skills, because I've written so much with my old band that it just didn't affect me too much."<ref name="An Interview with Deuce" />

==Musical style, lyrical themes, and influences==
Deuce uses a mixture of [[rap rock]] and [[hip hop]] music with elements of [[metal music]], much like his former band [[Hollywood Undead]] and has been compared to such, along with the early works of [[Eminem]], particularly from his works off the debut album ''[[Nine Lives (Deuce album)|Nine Lives]]''.<ref name="Fridaetvs review of Nine Lives">{{cite web|title=Deuce – Nine Lives: Album Review|url=http://fridaetv.com/2012/05/08/deuce-nine-lives-album-review/|work=Fridaetv.com|publisher=Fridaetv|access-date=January 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116071635/http://fridaetv.com/2012/05/08/deuce-nine-lives-album-review/|archive-date=January 16, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Deuce's lyrics, a lot like Hollywood Undead's debut album ''[[Swan Songs (Hollywood Undead album)|Swan Songs]]'', tends to be a mixture of serious then sexual themes, often using [[Swear words|explicit language]], however has been negatively criticized due to choice of wording.<ref name="Absolute Punk review of Nine Lives">{{cite web|title=Deuce - Nine Lives|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=2727372|work=absolutepunk.net|publisher=Absolute Punk|access-date=January 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Loudwires review of Nine Lives">{{cite web|title=DEUCE, 'NINE LIVES' – Album Review|url=http://loudwire.com/deuce-nine-lives-album-review/|work=Loudwire.com|publisher=Loudwire|access-date=January 15, 2014}}</ref>

Deuce's album ''Nine Lives'' has often been seen as a successor to the ''Swan Songs'' album by his fans and in some reviews<ref name="Fridaetvs review of Nine Lives" /> and even claimed in multiple interviews himself that the album is. He said, in an interview with [[YouTube personality]] Bryan Stars, that he wrote and produced on that album and continued to say that his music was better than what the band is now without him and that people should listen to his album if they want songs akin to ''Swan Songs''.<ref name="Deuce attacks Hollywood Undead">{{cite web|title=Deuce Responds Hollywood Undead New Interview 9Lives 2012|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PNf2-dW_5es|work=YouTube.com|publisher=BryanStars|access-date=January 15, 2014}}</ref>

Deuce's musical style has been described as [[rap rock]].<ref name="invinciblereview">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/cdreviews/invincible/|title=CD Reviews: Invicible Deuce|access-date=February 1, 2021}}</ref>

==Band members==
Although a solo artist, Deuce used to perform with a live "crew" known as Nine Lives to provide additional instrumentation and vocals. It's been rumored the group has since disbanded, as they haven't performed live since 2014<ref>{{Citation|title=Deuce - Arena Moscow (28.03.2014) Remastered Full Concert - (MATRIX)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrCnIIu0700|language=en|access-date=2021-12-02}}</ref> and most members' social media have been deleted or gone silent. The following list includes Deuce's band, though does not feature the many early rappers in Nine Lives alongside Deuce.
