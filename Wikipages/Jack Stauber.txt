== Notable projects and videos ==

==="Buttercup" and "Oh Klahoma" ===
Stauber's most famous work, "Buttercup", is the opening song released on his 2017 album ''Pop Food''. The song, along with remixes and covers of it, became a popular [[internet meme]], especially on [[TikTok]],<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|last=Serra|first=Maria|date=2020-11-05|title=10 artists you've heard on TikTok who you actually need to listen to|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/popular-tiktok-songs-alternative/|access-date=2021-04-01|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref> which contributed substantially to its success. The song currently has 306 million [[Spotify]] streams as of October 2021. Stauber did not release an official music video for "Buttercup". The song has been described as "bubbly, dramatic pop with Panda Bear-esque vocals."<ref name=":1" /> YouTuber ''lisuga'' made a popular fan made video using clips from the Japanese short film, "[[Kick-Heart]]". It is the most viewed Jack Stauber-related video on YouTube, with 203 million views as of August 2021.

"Oh Klahoma", the second track from ''Pop Food'', also became popular. The song currently has 92 million [[Spotify]] streams as of October 2021. The song is most famously used as background music to a TikTok trend called #ghostphotoshoot, where creators dress up as ghosts and take photos of themselves, sometimes wearing sunglasses and other fashion accessories.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ainsworth|first=Harry|date=September 24, 2020|title=Seriously, why is everyone dressing up as ghosts on TikTok right now?|url=https://thetab.com/uk/2020/09/24/dressing-up-as-ghosts-tiktok-176311|url-status=live|access-date=May 18, 2021|website=[[The Tab]]}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> However, the trend has become controversial, with critics saying the bedsheet costumes used look like [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]] robes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Haasch|first=Palmer|date=September 26, 2020|title=TikTokers are being called out for a 'ghost photoshoot' trend that critics say reminds them of KKK robes|url=https://www.insider.com/ghost-photoshoot-tiktok-kkk-criticism-racist-2020-9|url-status=live|access-date=May 18, 2021|website=[[Insider Inc.#Insider|Insider]]}}</ref>

=== Adult Swim ===
Stauber has done multiple projects for [[Adult Swim]]. These projects have all done extremely well on YouTube and Adult Swim, getting millions of views.

==== ''Wishing Apple'' and ''Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely'' ====
The first short Stauber created for Adult Swim was called "Wishing Apple," a short released on July 3, 2018 on the Adult Swim YouTube channel.<ref name="adult-swim" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Stauber|first=Jack|date=July 3, 2018|title=Wishing Apple {{!}} adult swim smalls|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lzQWC57HSc|url-status=live|access-date=May 9, 2021|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Jack Stauber}}</ref>

The next was "Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely," which premiered on [[Off the Air (TV series)|Off The Air]]'s season eight episode "Love" on August 28, 2018.<ref name="adult-swim" /> However, the short was created and released on Valentine's Day, almost 6 months before the short was released on Adult Swim, on February 14, 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stauber|first=Jack|date=February 14, 2018|title=Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WUwfQlrlqA|url-status=live|access-date=May 9, 2021|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=Jack Stauber}}</ref> The video was also shortened for its Adult Swim premiere.

==== ''SHOP: A Pop Opera'' ====
Nearly a year after "Valentine's Day is Not for the Lonely" was created, the [[surrealist film|surreal]] [[musical film|musical]] [[comedy film|comedy]]  ''SHOP: A Pop Opera'' premiered on Adult Swim in March 2019. The series utilizes [[mixed media]], incorporated [[clay animation]], music, and [[VHS]]-like filters.<ref name="Keeley 2019" /> The six-part series aired each episode at midnight from March 4 to March 9. The episodes were also uploaded onto YouTube the next day. A year later, Stauber released the soundtrack for the miniseries on March 8, after someone hacked into his account and fraudulently uploaded the soundtrack in October of the previous year.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stauber|first=Jack|date=October 17, 2019|title=Regarding a Fraudulent Release|url=https://www.patreon.com/posts/regarding-30843388|url-status=live|access-date=March 21, 2021|website=Patreon}}</ref> On November 4, 2020, the full series was uploaded onto the Adult Swim YouTube channel.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stauber|first=Jack|date=November 4, 2020|title=SHOP: A Pop Opera {{!}} adult swim smalls|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tSkz4vATkQE|url-status=live|access-date=May 9, 2021|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Adult Swim]]}}</ref>

The series centers on an unnamed man, nicknamed Jeff by the community, who goes shopping at the grocery store. With each object on his list, he encounters individuals who are engrossed in a personal habit or dilemma, while also vaguely resembling the thing he is shopping for. After being dissatisfied with picking a random pound of cheese, he overcomes his indecisiveness and goes to try a sample of yogurt he was mulling over previously. 

==== ''Jack Stauber's OPAL'' ====
The latest Adult Swim project created by Stauber is a short [[surrealist film|surreal]] [[musical film|musical]] [[psychological horror]] film, entitled ''Jack Stauber's OPAL'', which premiered on October 31, 2020.{{refn|group=note|name=opaloctober|Although Adult Swim lists the short as being released on October 30th, it was released at midnight, so it is essentially October 31st.}}<ref name="Keeley 2019">{{cite web|url=https://kittysneezes.com/shop-a-pop-opera/|title='Shop: A Pop Opera' Is Tops, Full of Bops, and You Should Watch Chop-Chop|last=Keeley|first=Matt|date=March 11, 2019|website=Kittysneezes|language=en-US|access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref><ref name="adult-swim">{{Cite web|last=Grutter|first=Felipe|date=March 3, 2021|title=Conheça o bizarro mundo de Jack Stauber, rei do Micropop e animador do Adult Swim|url=https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/noticia/conheca-jack-stauber-rei-do-micropop-e-animador-do-adult-swim/|url-status=live|access-date=April 1, 2021|website=Rolling Stone|language=pt-br}}</ref> The same day, ''OPAL'' was also released on the Adult Swim YouTube channel.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stauber|first=Jack|date=October 31, 2020|title=Jack Stauber's OPAL {{!}} adult swim smalls|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1pVLJl_snc|url-status=live|access-date=May 9, 2021|website=[[YouTube]]|publisher=[[Adult Swim]]}}</ref> Stauber also received help from the producers at [[Williams Street]] for the creation of ''OPAL''.

The short centers on a girl named Opal who lives with her kind and caring family. They tell her to stay away from a creepy house from across the street, but her curiosity gets the best of her and she finds herself trapped in the dark house. She meets the inhabitants, an old man who smokes and watches TV, a conceited man who talks about his looks, and a woman who drinks and blames others for her problems. All of them refer to Opal as "Claire" and chase her into the attic where she locks the door. Opal looks out the window to find that instead of her house, there is a billboard for "Opal's Burgers", implying that she is in fact Claire and that her kind family were the result of her mentally running away from her real life. She once again succumbs to her fantasy life as her real family attempt to break down her door.

Meg Fair of ''[[Pittsburgh City Paper]]'' highlighted Stauber's knack of "pulling unrelated sounds and influences into [his] music, throwing them into a bowl and tossing them into a strange salad that challenges your musical taste buds."<ref name=":9" /> Jenna Minnig of ''PennState CommMedia'' compared Stauber's music to [[Ariel Pink]]'s; as both have [[Hypnagogic pop|hypnagogic-pop]] styles and have similar voices, but believed it was unnecessary and reductionary to compare the two.<ref name=":8" /> ''Knoxville News Sentinel''<nowiki/>'s Chuck Campbell described Stauber's music videos as "nostalgic and childlike, but there’s also something disturbingly adult about them, the kind of thing that might have surfaced on ''[[Pee-wee's Playhouse]]'' back in the day."<ref name=":12" />
