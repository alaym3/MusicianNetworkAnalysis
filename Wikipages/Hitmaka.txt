===2007–present===
[[File:Yung Berg in 2007 (6904212018).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Ward in 2007.]]
Ward's debut single, "[[Sexy Lady (Yung Berg song)|Sexy Lady]]", which featured R&B singer Junior, became a hit on [[Los Angeles]] urban radio, and he signed with [[Epic Records]] among many labels that approached him. Ward's six-track [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Almost Famous: The Sexy Lady EP]]'' was released in July 2007. Also in 2007, Ward made a cameo in the music video of singer [[Kat DeLuna]]'s debut single "[[Whine Up]]". "Sexy Lady" peaked at #18 on the ''Billboard'' 100. In addition to that single, Ward recorded a song with [[Lil Wayne]] and [[Brisco (rapper)|Brisco]] titled “Bitch Please” which was released in November 2007.

In December 2007, Ward released another single "[[Sexy Can I]]", a collaboration with singer [[Ray J]], then his debut album ''[[Look What You Made Me]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> The second single was "[[Do That There]]", featuring [[Dude 'n' Nem]], followed by "[[The Business (song)|The Business]]", featuring Casha, which peaked at #33 on the Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=yung berg|chart=all}}|title=Artist Chart History – Yung Berg – Singles|publisher=Billboard|access-date=June 24, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Look What You Made Me]]'' would chart at #20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and at #2 on the [[Top Rap Albums]] chart.

However, as evidenced by the trailer for his new TV show, titled ''Back In Business'', it will not be a dating show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhoGrkiCYz42YESXLf |title=Video: Yung Berg Back To Business [Reality Show Trailer&#93; |publisher=Worldstarhiphop.com |access-date=November 6, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydPt1YO88ro|title=Young Berg and his Bitchassness (black girl diss)|publisher=YouTube|access-date=November 6, 2010}}</ref> But the reality show was never released as planned.

"After I did the interview, I called [[Ray J]] and I said, 'Yo, this is what I talked about in my interview,' because I spoke candidly about our relationship and I felt my loyalty is to Ray, it's not nowhere near to Teairra. I don't even know her like that, and at the end of the day, why are we gonna go back and forth about how you tried to holla at me...you know what you did...I've got bigger things to worry about than being trivial over some pussy, especially when there's so much pussy out there. I've been called worse by better people than her". In 2014, during the first season of the [[VH1]] show ''[[Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood]]'', it was revealed that Ward and Marí had resolved their former issues towards each other. Later in the season, he produced her song "Deserve".
