'''Norma Cecilia Tanega''' (January 30, 1939 – December 29, 2019)<ref name="Allen, Jan 2020"/> was an [[United States|American]] [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music|pop]] [[singing|singer]]-[[songwriter]], painter, and [[experimental music]]ian. In the 1960s, she had a hit with the [[single (music)|single]] "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog" and wrote songs for [[Dusty Springfield]] and other prominent musicians. In later decades, Tanega worked mostly as a percussionist, playing various styles of music in the bands Baboonz, hybridVigor, and Ceramic Ensemble.  She is also known for "You're Dead", the theme song of ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]''.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Norma Tanega was born in [[Vallejo, California]], near [[San Francisco]], United States,<ref name="Allen, Jan 2020"/> and moved to [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] at the age of two. Her mother, Otilda Tanega, was [[Panama]]nian. Her father, Tomas Tanega, was [[Filipino people|Filipino]] and worked as a bandmaster for 30 years in the [[United States Navy]] aboard the [[USS Hornet (CV-12)|USS ''Hornet'']] before eventually leading his own band. Norma's older brother Rudy served in the [[United States Air Force]].<ref name="Williams, 1955">{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Vera|title=Rudy Tanega|work=Independent Press-Telegram from|date=August 21, 1955|location=Long Beach, California|page=68|language=en}}</ref>

Tanega began [[classical music|classical]] piano lessons at age nine. She entered [[Long Beach Polytechnic High School]] in 1952 and in her senior year directed the school's art gallery. By age 16 she was exhibiting her paintings at both Long Beach's [[Long Beach Public Library|Public Library]] and its [[Long Beach Museum of Art|Municipal Art Center]], playing [[Beethoven]] and [[Bartók]] at piano recitals, and writing poetry.<ref name="Williams, 1955" /> At age 17, she entered [[Scripps College]] on a scholarship and continued her studies at [[Claremont Graduate School]], earning an MFA in 1962.<ref name="LTD, 2011">{{cite news|title=Norma Tanega talks about her 'lost' album, sold exclusively through "Let's Talk Dusty!" – Let's Talk Dusty!|url=http://www.dustyspringfield.org.uk/LTD/index.php/events/30-norma-tanega-talks-about-her-lost-album-sold-exclusively-through-let-s-talk-dusty|access-date=8 September 2017|work=Let's Talk Dusty|date=June 3, 2011|language=en-gb}}</ref>

Tanega spent a summer backpacking around Europe and moved to New York City to pursue her artistic career. While living in [[Greenwich Village]], she was involved in the folk music scene and political activism, including early [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]].<ref name="Valentine and Wickham, 2014">{{cite book|last1=Valentine|first1=Penny|last2=Wickham|first2=Vicki|title=Dancing with Demons: The Authorized Biography of Dusty Springfield|date=2014|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9781466878211|language=en}}</ref>

===Music career===
===="Walkin' My Cat Named Dog"====
Tanega worked for a short time at a [[mental hospital]], where she sang and played songs for patients.<ref name="McLane & Wong, 1995" /> She spent her summers working as a camp counselor [[Upstate New York|upstate]] in the [[Catskill Mountains]].<ref name="Unterberger, 2014">{{cite book|last1=Unterberger|first1=Richie|title=Jingle Jangle Morning: Folk-Rock in the 1960s|date=2014|publisher=BookBaby|isbn=9780991589210|language=en}}</ref> [[Brooklyn]]-based record producer [[Herb Bernstein]] saw Tanega performing while visiting the camp one summer.<ref name="LTD, 2011" /> Impressed by what he saw, Bernstein introduced her to [[The Four Seasons (band)|Four Seasons]] songwriter [[Bob Crewe]].

Her first single, "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog", became an international hit in 1966, peaking at number 22 on both the [[United States|U.S.]] [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the [[UK Singles Chart]]s, and #3 in Canada.<ref name="Billboard, April 1966">{{cite news|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=9 April 1966|language=en|title=Hot 100}}</ref><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|first=David|last=Roberts|year=2006|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|edition=19th|publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd|location=London, UK|isbn=1-904994-10-5|page=549}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.5724.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles - April 18, 1966}}</ref> Tanega's impetus for the song came from living in a New York City apartment building that did not allow dogs; instead she owned a cat which she named "Dog" and took for walks.<ref name="Choron, Choron and Moore, 2007">{{cite book|last1=Choron|first1=Sandra|last2=Choron|first2=Harry|last3=Moore|first3=Arden|title=Planet Cat: A Cat-Alog|date=2007|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0618812592|page=[https://archive.org/details/planetcatcatalog00chor/page/59 59]|language=en|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/planetcatcatalog00chor/page/59}}</ref> The single's success landed her appearances on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' and ''[[Where the Action Is]]'',<ref name="IPT, 1966">{{cite news|work=Independent Press-Telegram|title=Norma Tanega|date=April 10, 1966|location=Long Beach, California|pages=185, 189|language=en}}</ref> and a slot as the only woman on a North American tour with [[Gene Pitney]], [[Bobby Goldsboro]], [[Chad and Jeremy]] and [[The McCoys]].

Since they were unable to follow Tanega's more idiosyncratic music, the Outsiders were later replaced by [[session musician]]s accompanying her onstage.<ref name="McLane & Wong, 1995" /> While some of her songs riffed on traditional tunes like "Hey Girl", derived from [[Lead Belly]]'s take on "[[In the Pines]]",<ref name="Miller, 2014">{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Quinn|title=Hey People, Come Free With Me: New Voices from 1966 « The Hooded Utilitarian|url=http://www.hoodedutilitarian.com/2014/11/hey-people-come-free-with-me-new-voices-from-1966/|access-date=13 September 2017|work=The Hooded Utilitarian|date=November 14, 2014}}</ref> many of her songs diverged from the structure of typical pop and folk music, such as her song "No Stranger Am I", set to a 5/4 [[time signature]].<ref name="Howes and Clark, 2012">{{cite book|last1=Howes|first1=Paul|last2=Clark|first2=Petula|title=The Complete Dusty Springfield|date=2012|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=9781781165409|language=en}}</ref>

While Tanega's next three singles had less commercial success than "Walkin' My Cat Named Dog", her debut album was named after its big hit<ref name="Billboard, May 1966">{{cite news|last1=Inc|title=Pop Spotlight: Walkin' My Cat Named Dog|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=14 May 1966|language=en}}</ref> and its  popularity spawned several cover versions by contemporary artists.

====Years in the United Kingdom====
In 1966, Tanega traveled to England to promote her music. Her tour included a performance on the ITV program ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'', where she met British pop singer [[Dusty Springfield]]. After Tanega returned to the U.S., Springfield made many transatlantic calls to her and accrued a large phone bill.<ref name="Valentine and Wickham, 2014" /> On a visit to New York, Springfield entered a romantic relationship with Tanega. They returned to England and lived together for five years.<ref name="Bartlett, 2014">{{cite book|last1=Bartlett|first1=Karen|title=Dusty: An Intimate Portrait of a Musical Legend|date=2014|publisher=Biteback Publishing|isbn=9781849547635|language=en}}</ref>

The couple took up residence in London's [[Kensington]] district, where Tanega continued to paint and play music.<ref name="Hashish, 2017">{{cite news|last1=Hashish|first1=Amira|title=Dusty's home is for sale – perfect for Diana Vickers' role research|url=http://www.homesandproperty.co.uk/luxury/celebrity-homes/home-for-son-of-a-preacher-man-star-dusty-springfields-kensington-houses-price-has-dropped-by-1m-so-a111321.html|access-date=8 September 2017|work=Homes and Property|date=13 June 2017|quote=Pop star Diana Vickers will portray the late, great Dusty Springfield in the new musical Son of a Preacher Man, directed by Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood.

Springfield recorded many of Tanega's songs. These included "No Stranger Am I", the 5/4 number that originally appeared on Tanega's first album; "The Colour of Your Eyes", which Tanega wrote for Springfield in [[Venice, Los Angeles]]; "Earthbound Gypsy" and "Midnight Sounds", both co-written in New York with Tanega's high school friend Dan White; and "Come for a Dream", co-written with [[bossa nova]] musician [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]]. Tanega also penned the English language lyrics for Springfield's version of "Morning", a cover of the song "Bom Dia" by [[Gilberto Gil]] and [[Nana Caymmi]]. In 1970 Tanega teamed up with jazz pianist [[Blossom Dearie]] to write a song about Springfield for Dearie's album ''That's Just the Way I Want to Be''.<ref name="Howes and Clark, 2012" />

Many of Tanega's songs appeared as non-album [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] to Springfield's singles. Some, like the outtake "Go My Love", appeared only on collections released years after their recording.<ref name="SDGLN, 2015">{{cite news|last1=SDGLN Staff|title=Meet LGBT History Month icons Michael Sam, Barbra Siperstein, and Dusty Springfield|url=http://sdgln.com/causes/2015/10/26/meet-lgbt-history-month-icons-michael-sam-barbra-siperstein-and-dusty-springfield|access-date=8 September 2017|work=San Diego Gay and Lesbian News|date=26 October 2015|quote=During the late 1960s and early '70s, Springfield was romantically linked to Norma Tanega, a California-born singer-songwriter who wrote a few of Springfield's songs such as "Go My Love."}}</ref> Tanega also went uncredited for many of her collaborations with Springfield, and by 1970 their relationship was deteriorating.<ref name="Howes and Clark, 2012" /> Tanega secured a contract with the British division of [[RCA Records]], for whom she recorded the album ''I Don't Think It Will Hurt If You Smile'' in 1971 with producer/keyboardist Mike Moran and Don Paul of British rock group [[The Viscounts (British band)|The Viscounts]].<ref name="LTD, 2011" /><ref name="Hi-fi News, 1972">{{cite book|title=Hi-fi News & Record Review|date=1972|publisher=Link House Publications|page=327|language=en}}</ref> When Tanega returned to the U.S. before the album's promotion, it failed to achieve the chart success of her earlier work.<ref name="Randall, 2008">{{cite book|last1=Randall|first1=Annie J.|title=Dusty!: Queen of the Postmods|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199716302|page=163|language=en}}</ref> Dusty Springfield biographer Annie J.

Norma's Panamanian and Filipino roots give the songs an earthy and exotic flavor. Her warmth and joy make you smile and dance every time you listen to her sing and play.}}</ref>

Her next band was called Baboonz with guitarist Tom Skelly and bassist Mario Verlangieri. The trio released a self-titled CD in 2008, the album ''HA!''
