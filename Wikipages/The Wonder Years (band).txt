==History==

===Formation, the early years (2005–2006)===
The Wonder Years were formed in 2005 out of the remnants of an old Lansdale, PA band called The Premier.<ref name=AMbio/> The Premier consisted of Dan "Soupy" Campbell, Matt Brasch, Nick Steinborn, Matt Hittinger, Dave Hughes and CJ Morgan.<ref name=AMbio/> Dave Hughes, CJ Morgan, and Matt Hittinger didn't join The Wonder Years. Their first practice was in Mike Kennedy's basement on July 5, 2005. On that day they wrote their first song, "Buzz Aldrin: The Poster Boy for Second Place".

In their first two years, two relatively unknown split EPs with other local bands were released. Their first (with Emergency and I) was released in 2005, featuring three songs.<ref name=AMbio/> Two of those were later re-recorded on their first full-length album ''[[Get Stoked on It!]]''. ("I Fell in Love with a Ninja Master" and "Buzz Aldrin: The Poster Boy for Second Place"). The other song on the split was "Cowboy Killers".

The Wonder Years followed their first split EP with another, this time with the band Bangarang!.<ref name=AMbio/> This second release also featured two songs that would be re-recorded for ''[[Get Stoked on It!]]''. ("My Geraldine Lies Over the Delaware" and "Let's Moshercise!"). The other two songs were "I Ain't Sayin' He a Gold Digga (Sike!)" and "Through Two Hearts".

===''Get Stoked on It!'' and ''Won't Be Pathetic Forever EP'' (2007–2009)===
{{Main|Get Stoked on It!}}

[[File:The Wonder Years Live.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The Wonder Years Performing live in 2009]]
The Wonder Years signed to [[No Sleep Records]] in 2007.<ref name=AMbio/> After completing their first tour of the United Kingdom with Never So True, The Wonder Years recorded their first full-length studio album, ''[[Get Stoked on It!]]''.<ref name=AMbio/> ''Get Stoked on It!'' was released on October 30, 2007 and caused the band's then-small fan base to grow significantly. In the spring of 2008, The Wonder Years released an EP titled ''Won't Be Pathetic Forever''. In 2009, The Wonder Years' released a split EP titled ''Distances'' with UK pop punk band All or Nothing.  The split consisted of only two songs by The Wonder Years, and it was after this release that keyboardist/vocalist Mikey Kelly left the band to pursue other goals.

===''The Upsides'' (2010–2011)===
{{Main|The Upsides}}

The Wonder Years' second full-length album, ''[[The Upsides]]'', was released on January 26, 2010.<ref name=AMUpsidesreview/> ''The Upsides'' sold 1852 units in its first week, landing it on multiple Billboard charts: No.&nbsp;5 on Alternative Artist, No.&nbsp;9 on Top New Artist, No.&nbsp;26 on Top Internet Album, and No.&nbsp;43 on Indie Label Album.<ref name="abs">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1541761|title=Congrats on Outselling Heidi Montag|publisher=[[AbsolutePunk]]|access-date=2010-02-04}}</ref>

Also with the release of ''The Upsides'' was a 7" limited to only 500 copies and available with pre-order of ''The Upsides'' CD. This vinyl features a non-album song entitled "Leavenhouse. 11:30.",  which is about the early years of music for The Wonder Years and their local scene in Lansdale, PA. The title "Leavenhouse" refers to a house in which members of the Lansdale band Leavenworth lived and hung out at day or night.

A few months after the release of ''The Upsides'', on May 27, The Wonder Years announced that they had signed to [[Hopeless Records]]. Their first release after their signing was a split 7" with Fallen from the Sky, on which they covered "Zip Lock" by [[Lit (band)|Lit]].

The Wonder Years released a deluxe edition of ''The Upsides'' on September 21, 2010. It included 4 new songs titled, "I Was Scared & I'm Sorry", "We Won't Bury You", "Dynamite Shovel (campfire version)", and "Logan Circle: A New Hope". "We Won't Bury You" was written about best friend Mike Pelone who was also in the band Emergency and I. Mike Pelone died in August 2010.

In October 2010, The Wonder Years released a music video for the song "Melrose Diner" set to the theme of BAW Wrestling and starring actor [[Charlie Saxton]] as the wrestler "Lone Wolf".<ref>{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26vKAaj6Ff0|title=The Wonder Years - Melrose Diner (Official Music Video)|date=11 October 2010|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=22 March 2015}}</ref>

===''Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing'' (2011–2013)===
{{Main|Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing}}

In the fall of 2010, The Wonder Years confirmed that they were writing the follow up to ''The Upsides''. On June 14, 2011 The Wonder Years released ''[[Suburbia I've Given You All and Now I'm Nothing]]'' on Hopeless Records. "Suburbia" is inspired by the poem [[America (poem)|America]] by [[Allen Ginsberg]] as well as the band's life following the release of ''The Upsides''. The first single off the album titled "Local Man Ruins Everything" was released on April 12, 2011 on iTunes. The second single, "Don't Let Me Cave In", was released on iTunes and Amazon on May 3, 2011, along with a music video. The third single, "Coffee Eyes" was made available for streaming on the Alternative Press website on June 1, 2011. The record charted at number 73 on the Billboard Top 200 the week of its release, selling 8,100 copies. On August 11, 2011 they released a music video for "Local Man Ruins Everything". The video consists of Hank the Pigeon "adventuring on his own" around Lansdale and Philadelphia.

The band released a split 6-inch with Stay Ahead of the Weather entitled ''Punk Is Dead. Get a Job.'' on April 17, 2012 and re-released their debut full-length, ''Get Stoked on It!'', on May 15, 2012. The album will only be available digitally through the record label's website. Campbell, who has been outspoken about his disappointment in the band's first album, said, "In our opinion, this record is a trainwreck. Chris paid to get it remastered forever ago and we kept trying to put off its inevitable re-release. He and I agreed that since it's already available digitally, that no real harm can come of swapping out the old mixes with the better sounding ones as long as it never gets pressed in a physical form again. That's the long and short of it. If you like the record, enjoy the new mixes. If you hate the record, I'm on your side. We won't be playing any of these songs live in support of this. We don't even consider it a re-release. Just a swap out for a better mix."<ref>{{cite web |last=Campbell |first=Dan |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?p=106543192#post=106543192 |website=Absolutepunk.net |title=The Wonder Years' Get Stoked On It To See Digital-Only Reissue via No Sleep Records |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref>
