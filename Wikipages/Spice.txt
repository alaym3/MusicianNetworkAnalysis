A '''spice''' is a [[seed]], [[fruit]], [[root]], [[Bark (botany)|bark]], or other [[plant]] substance primarily used for [[flavor]]ing or [[color]]ing food. Spices are distinguished from [[herb]]s, which are the leaves, flowers, or stems of plants used for [[flavor]]ing or as a [[garnish (food)|garnish]]. Spices are sometimes used in [[medicine]], [[Sacred rite|religious rituals]], [[cosmetics]] or [[perfume]] production.{{Example needed|date=December 2018}}

==History==
{{main|Spice trade}}

===Early history===
The spice trade developed throughout the [[Indian subcontinent]]<ref name="Sidebotham2019">{{cite book|author=Steven E. Sidebotham|title=Berenike and the Ancient Maritime Spice Route|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tw6LDwAAQBAJ|date=7 May 2019|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-30338-6}}</ref> by at earliest 2000 BCE with [[cinnamon]] and [[black pepper]], and in [[East Asia]] with herbs and pepper. The Egyptians used herbs for [[Ancient Egyptian funerary practices|mummification]] and their demand for exotic spices and herbs helped stimulate world trade. The word ''spice'' comes from the Old French word ''espice'', which became ''epice'', and which came from the Latin root ''spec'', the noun referring to "appearance, sort, kind": ''[[species]]'' has the same root. By 1000 BCE, medical systems based upon herbs could be found in [[China]], [[Korea]], and [[India]]. Early uses were connected with magic, medicine, religion, tradition, and preservation.<ref name=ABCp14>{{cite book |last=Murdock |first=Linda | title=A Busy Cook's Guide to Spices: How to Introduce New Flavors to Everyday Meals | publisher=Bellwether Books | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-9704285-0-9 | page=14}}</ref>

[[Clove]]s were used in [[Mesopotamia]] by 1700 BCE.{{refn |group=note |A team of archaeologists led by [[Giorgio Buccellati]] excavating the ruins of a burned-down house at the site of [[Terqa]], in modern-day [[Syria]], found a ceramic pot containing a handful of cloves.

The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had cloves in the 1st century CE, as [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote about them.<ref name="Duke 2002 p. 7">{{cite book |last=Duke |first=J.A. |title=CRC Handbook of Medicinal Spices |publisher=CRC Press |year=2002 |isbn=978-1-4200-4048-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vPTLBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA7 |access-date=2017-05-09 |page=7}}</ref>

The earliest written records of spices come from ancient Egyptian, Chinese, and Indian cultures. The [[Ebers Papyrus]] from early Egypt dating from 1550 <small>B.C.E.</small> describes some eight hundred different medicinal remedies and numerous medicinal procedures.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Food and Culture|last=Woodward|first=Penny|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|year=2003|editor-last=Katz|volume=2|pages=187–195|chapter=Herbs and Spices}}</ref>

Historians believe that [[nutmeg]], which originates from the [[Banda Islands]] in [[Southeast Asia]], was introduced to Europe in the 6th century BCE.<ref>{{cite book |last=Burkill |first=I.H. |title=A Dictionary of the Economic Products of the Malay Peninsula |publisher=Ministry of Agriculture and Co-Operatives |location=Kuala Lumpur |year=1966}}</ref>

Indonesian merchants traveled around China, India, the Middle East, and the east coast of Africa. [[Arab]] merchants facilitated the routes through the Middle East and India. This resulted in the Egyptian [[port city]] of [[Alexandria]] being the main trading center for spices. The most important discovery prior to the European spice trade was the [[monsoon]] winds (40 CE). Sailing from Eastern spice cultivators to Western European consumers gradually replaced the land-locked spice routes once facilitated by the Middle East Arab caravans.<ref name=ABCp14/>

In the story of [[Genesis (Old Testament)|Genesis]], [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] was sold into slavery by his brothers to spice merchants. In the biblical poem [[Song of Solomon]], the male speaker compares his beloved to many forms of spices.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Le livre des merveilles de Marco Polo-pepper.jpg|thumb|left|"The Mullus" harvesting pepper. Illustration from a French edition of ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]''.]]
Spices were among the most demanded and expensive products available in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]],<sup>[[Spice#cite note-5|[5]]]</sup> the most common being [[black pepper]], [[cinnamon]] (and the cheaper alternative [[Cinnamomum aromaticum|cassia]]), [[cumin]], [[nutmeg]], [[ginger]] and [[cloves]]. Given medieval medicine's main theory of [[humorism]], spices and herbs were indispensable to balance "humors" in food,<sup>[[Spice#cite note-6|[6]]]</sup> a daily basis for good health at a time of recurrent [[pandemic]]s. In addition to being desired by those using [[Medieval medicine of Western Europe|medieval medicine]], the European elite also craved spices in the [[Middle Ages]]. An example of the European aristocracy's demand for spice comes from the [[King of Aragon]], who invested substantial resources into bringing back spices to [[Spain]] in the 12th century. He was specifically looking for spices to put in [[wine]], and was not alone among [[European Monarchs|European monarchs]] at the time to have such a desire for spice.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Freedman|first=Paul|date=2015-06-05|title=Health, wellness and the allure of spices in the Middle Ages|journal=Journal of Ethnopharmacology|series=Potent Substances: On the Boundaries of Food and Medicine|volume=167|pages=47–53|doi=10.1016/j.jep.2014.10.065|pmid=25450779}}</ref>

Spices were all imported from plantations in Asia and Africa, which made them expensive. From the 8th until the 15th century, the [[Republic of Venice]] had the monopoly on spice trade with the Middle East, and along with it the neighboring Italian [[maritime republics]] and city-states. The trade made the region rich. It has been estimated that around 1,000&nbsp; tons of pepper and 1,000&nbsp; tons of the other common spices were imported into Western Europe each year during the [[Late Middle Ages]]. The value of these goods was the equivalent of a yearly supply of grain for 1.5 million people.<ref>{{cite book |author=Adamson, Melitta Weiss|title=Food in Medieval Times|url=https://archive.org/details/foodmedievaltime00adam_218|url-access=limited|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|year=2004|isbn=978-0-313-32147-4|page= [https://archive.org/details/foodmedievaltime00adam_218/page/n89 65]}}</ref> The most exclusive was [[saffron]], used as much for its vivid yellow-red color as for its flavor. Spices that have now fallen into obscurity in European cuisine include [[Aframomum melegueta|grains of paradise]], a relative of [[cardamom]] which mostly replaced pepper in late medieval north French cooking, [[long pepper]], [[nutmeg|mace]], [[spikenard]], [[galangal]] and [[cubeb]].

===Early Modern Period===
[[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] were interested in seeking new routes to trade in spices and other valuable products from Asia. The control of trade routes and the spice-producing regions were the main reasons that [[Portugal|Portuguese]] navigator [[Vasco da Gama]] sailed to [[India]] in 1499.<sup>[[Spice#cite note-8|[8]]]</sup> When da Gama discovered the pepper market in [[India]], he was able to secure peppers for a much cheaper price than the ones demanded by [[Venice]].<ref name=":0" /> At around the same time, [[Christopher Columbus]] returned from the [[New World]].  He described to [[investor]]s new spices available there.{{Citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Another source of competition in the spice trade during the 15th and 16th century was the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusans]] from the maritime republic of [[Dubrovnik]] in southern Croatia.<ref>Encyclopedia of Jewish Food, p. 453, Gil Marks, John Wiley & Sons, 2010. {{ISBN|978-0-470-39130-3}}</ref>

The military prowess of [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] (1453–1515) allowed the Portuguese to take control of the sea routes to India. In 1506, he took the island of [[Socotra]] in the mouth of the [[Red Sea]] and, in 1507, [[Ormuz]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Since becoming the [[viceroy]] of the [[Indies]], he took [[Goa]] in India in 1510, and [[Malacca]] on the [[Malay peninsula]] in 1511. The Portuguese could now trade directly with [[Thailand|Siam]], [[China]], and the [[Maluku Islands]].

With the discovery of the New World came new spices, including [[allspice]], [[chili pepper]]s, [[vanilla]], and [[chocolate]]. This development kept the spice trade, with America as a latecomer with its new seasonings, profitable well into the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

==Function==
Spices are primarily used as food [[flavor]]ing. They are also used to perfume [[cosmetics]] and [[incense]]. At various periods, many spices have been believed to have medicinal value. Finally, since they are expensive, rare, and exotic commodities, their [[conspicuous consumption]] has often been a symbol of wealth and social class.<ref name="freedman">Paul Freedman, ''Out of the East: Spices and the Medieval Imagination'', 2008, {{isbn|9780300151350}}, p. 2-3</ref>

{{quote box|align=right|width=35%|The most popular explanation for the love of spices in the Middle Ages is that they were used to preserve meat from spoiling, or to cover up the taste of meat that had already gone off. This compelling but false idea constitutes something of an urban legend, a story so instinctively attractive that mere fact seems unable to wipe it out... Anyone who could afford spices could easily find meat fresher than what city dwellers today buy in their local supermarket.<ref name="freedman"/>}}
It is often claimed that spices were used either as [[food preservation|food preservatives]] or to mask the taste of [[Meat spoilage|spoiled meat]], especially in the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name="freedman"/><ref name="ThomasDaoust2012">{{cite journal |last1=Thomas |first1=Frédéric |last2=Daoust |first2=Simon P. |last3=Raymond |first3=Michel |title=Can we understand modern humans without considering pathogens? |journal=Evolutionary Applications |volume=5 |issue=4 |year=2012 |pages=368–379 |issn=1752-4571 |doi=10.1111/j.1752-4571.2011.00231.x|pmid=25568057 |pmc=3353360 }}</ref> This is false.<ref>Paul Freedman, "Food Histories of the Middle Ages", in Kyri W.

They typically suggest adding spices toward the end of the cooking process, where they could have no preservative effect whatsoever."<ref name="krondl">Michael Krondl, ''The Taste of Conquest: The Rise and Fall of the Three Great Cities of Spice'', 2007, {{isbn|9780345480835}}, p. 6</ref> In fact, [[Cristoforo di Messisbugo]] suggested in the 16th century that pepper may speed up spoilage.<ref name="krondl"/>

Though some spices have [[antimicrobial]] properties in vitro,<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shelef |first1=L.A. |title=Antimicrobial Effects of Spices |journal=Journal of Food Safety |volume=6 |issue=1 |year=1984 |pages=29–44 |doi=10.1111/j.1745-4565.1984.tb00477.x}}</ref> pepper—by far the most common spice—is relatively ineffective, and in any case, salt, which is far cheaper, is also far more effective.<ref name="krondl"/>

==Handling==
[[File:Spice-shelf.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|A shelf of common spices for a home kitchen in Canada or the United States]]
[[File:Spice seller, Kashgar market.jpg|thumb|Spice seller, [[Kashgar]] market]]
<!--[[File: Kitchen utensils hanging below a spice rack.jpg|thumb|upright|A spice rack with cooking utensils]]-->

A spice may be available in several forms: fresh, whole dried, or pre-ground dried. Generally, spices are dried. Spices may be ground into a powder for convenience. A whole dried spice has the longest shelf life, so it can be purchased and stored in larger amounts, making it cheaper on a per-serving basis. A fresh spice, such as [[ginger]], is usually more flavorful than its dried form, but fresh spices are more expensive and have a much shorter shelf life. Some spices are not always available either fresh or whole, for example [[turmeric]], and often must be purchased in ground form. Small seeds, such as fennel and mustard seeds, are often used both whole and in powder form.

{{Anchor|Ground spices}}

[[File:Peugeot pepper mill.jpg|thumb|left|upright=.50|Pepper mill]]
For '''ground spices''', to grind a whole spice, the classic tool is [[mortar and pestle]]. Less labor-intensive tools are more common now:  a [[microplane]] or fine [[grater]] can be used to grind small amounts; a [[blade grinder|coffee grinder]]<ref group=note>Other types of coffee grinders, such as a [[burr mill]], can grind spices just as well as coffee beans.</ref> is useful for larger amounts. A frequently used spice such as black pepper may merit storage in its own hand grinder or [[Burr mill#Manual burr grinders|mill]].

The flavor of a spice is derived in part from compounds (volatile oils) that [[oxidize]] or evaporate when exposed to air. Grinding a spice greatly increases its surface area and so increases the rates of oxidation and evaporation. Thus, the flavor is maximized by storing a spice whole and grinding when needed. The shelf life of a whole dry spice is roughly two years; of a ground spice roughly six months.<ref name=GE714>{{Cite episode |title=Spice Capades |episode-link=List of Good Eats episodes#Season 7 |series=Good Eats |series-link=Good Eats |credits=Host: [[Alton Brown]] |network=Food Network |airdate=January 14, 2004 |season=7 |number=14 |ref=GE714}}</ref> The "flavor life" of a ground spice can be much shorter.<ref group=note>[[Nutmeg]], in particular, suffers from grinding and the flavor will degrade noticeably in a matter of days.</ref> Ground spices are better stored away from light.<ref group=note>Light contributes to oxidation processes.</ref>

Some flavor elements in spices are soluble in water; many are soluble in oil or fat. As a general rule, the flavors from a spice take time to infuse into the food so spices are added early in preparation. This contrasts to [[herb]]s which are usually added late in preparation.<ref name=GE714/>

===Salmonella contamination===
A study by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] of shipments of spices to the United States during fiscal years 2007-2009 showed about 7% of the shipments were contaminated by [[Salmonella]] bacteria, some of it antibiotic-resistant.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Van Dorena|first=Jane M.|author2=Daria Kleinmeiera |author3=Thomas S.

==Nutrition==
Because they tend to have strong flavors and are used in small quantities, spices tend to add few calories to food, even though many spices, especially those made from seeds, contain high portions of fat, protein, and carbohydrate by weight. However, when used in larger quantity, spices can also contribute a substantial amount of minerals and other [[micronutrient]]s, including iron, magnesium, calcium, and many others, to the diet. For example, a teaspoon of [[paprika]] contains about 1133 IU of [[Vitamin A]], which is over 20% of the recommended daily allowance specified by the US FDA.<ref name="usda-paprika">[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/247?qlookup=paprika&fg=&format=&man=&lfacet=&max=25&new=1 USDA National Nutrient Database: Nutrient data for 02028, Spices, paprika], Retrieved August 26, 2012</ref>

Most herbs and spices have substantial [[antioxidant]] activity, owing primarily to [[phenols|phenolic]] compounds, especially [[flavonoids]], which influence nutrition through many pathways, including affecting the absorption of other nutrients. One study found [[cumin]] and fresh [[ginger]] to be highest in antioxidant activity.<ref name="NinfaliMea2007">{{cite journal |last1=Ninfali |first1=Paolino |last2=Mea |first2=Gloria |last3=Giorgini |first3=Samantha |last4=Rocchi |first4=Marco |last5=Bacchiocca |first5=Mara |title=Antioxidant capacity of vegetables, spices and dressings relevant to nutrition |journal=British Journal of Nutrition |volume=93 |issue=2 |year=2007 |pages=257–66 |issn=0007-1145 |doi=10.1079/BJN20041327 |pmid=15788119|doi-access=free }}</ref>
