==Life and career==
Cruz was born to a Dominican mother and Mexican father. She spent two years, between ages 5 and 7, moving between the [[Dominican Republic]] and New Jersey until finally settling in New Jersey. At age 8, her father was deported to [[Mexico]], and she did not see him again until they were reunited in 2019 when she was 18 years old. She also met her little sister for the first time.<ref name=":0"/> The documentary [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-6FGACERMg ''Llegaron Las Flores''] was created to capture the experience of separation and reuniting with family. She remains an advocate for immigrant rights, having also performed at the [https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/arts/music/selena-for-sanctuary.html "Selena For Sanctuary"] concert in 2019 in [[New York City|New York]], which raised money for immigrant advocacy groups.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ambar Lucid Teases Debut LP with Dreamy New 'Story to Tell' Video|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/ambar-lucid-debut-lp-garden-of-lucid-story-to-tell-952054/|last=Exposito|first=Suzy|date=2020-02-13|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> The documentary was released the same week more [[Ice (disambiguation)|ICE]] raids were announced in multiple large cities.<ref name=":0" />

She started singing at the age of 5, and started by posting [[Song cover|song covers]] on [[YouTube]]. She is completely self-taught on the piano, guitar, and ukulele and used YouTube videos as guidance for vocal technique.<ref name=":13"/> She dropped out of high school before her senior year to move to [[Los Angeles]] and pursue music. She released her debut album ''Garden of Lucid'' in 2020 and an [[Extended play|EP]], ''Dreaming Lucid'', in 2019. Her lyrics include Spanish and English, about which she has been quoted saying, "If one day I decided, 'Listen, I’ma sing all in Spanish,' it would be fine. If I write songs that don’t have any Spanish in them, it would be fine. It feels really good to prove the person that said ['no one’s gonna pay attention to your music if you sing in Spanish'] wrong, just because it was such a hurtful thing to hear as a child with such a big dream."<ref name=":13" />

She has cited [[Alice Phoebe Lou]], [[Willow Smith]], and [[Kali Uchis]] as inspirations for her songwriting,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stop Sleeping on Ambar Lucid, a Bilingual Artist Making Devastating Indie Rock|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/g5xgkj/stop-sleeping-on-ambar-lucid-a-bilingual-artist-making-devastating-bedroom-pop|last=Silano|first=Jaime|date=2020-01-10|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref><ref name=":13" /> and notes peers [[Omar Apollo]] and [[Cuco (musician)|Cuco]] as the new generation of young [[Latino (demonym)|Latino]] artists whose music speaks to immigrant kids. In 2019, she announced she was going on tour with Omar Apollo.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ambar Lucid Announces Debut EP ‘Dreaming Lucid’ and Tour with Omar Apollo|url=https://remezcla.com/music/ambar-lucid-dreaming-lucid-ep-omar-apollo/|date=2019-02-14|website=Remezcla|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-12}}</ref> As of September 2021, she has amassed over 650,000 monthly listeners on [[Spotify]].<ref name=":13" />
