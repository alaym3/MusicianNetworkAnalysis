'''Young Bleed''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] artist based out of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].

==Biography==
Young Bleed started rhyming at the age of 9 at home in his native South [[Baton Rouge]], [[Louisiana]]. He claims to have been influenced by his mother, who had read poetry to him from a young age, and by [[Run-DMC]].<ref>(2005) [http://allhiphop.com/blogs/features/archive/2005/08/23/18133302.aspx "Young Bleed: Get Off tha Curb"]. ''Allhiphop.com.''  8/23/2005. Retrieved 6/18/07.</ref> By his teenage years, Bleed had begun recording his rhymes, selling hip-hop tapes independently to friends on the streets of his neighborhood. He was eventually signed to a local record label.<ref>(2005) [http://www.murderdog.com/october05/youngbleed.htm340 "Young Bleed"]. ''Murder Dog.'' Retrieved 6/18/07.</ref>  In 1995, he joined with four of his fellow Baton Rouge-based hip-hop artists – C-Loc, Max Minelli, J-Von, and J-Von's younger brother Chris Hamilton – to form the group Concentration Camp, with which he is still affiliated as of 2021.<ref>Rumney, J.

==Career==
Young Bleed's first glimpse of national fame was when his song with C-Loc, “How You Do That”, was remixed by Master P of No Limit Records. It was released on the 1997 soundtrack to Master P's film ''[[I'm Bout It]]'' which peaked at number one on [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]’s R&B/Hip Hop album charts in mid-1998.<ref>(nd) [http://www.billboard.com/charts/1998-07-25/r-b-hip-hop-albums Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums] ''Billboard Magazine''.  Retrieved 6/18/07.</ref>  Then, with the help of Master P, he signed a deal with [[Priority Records]] to release his major label debut album ''My Balls & My Word'' in 1998. The album peaked in at number ten on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number one on the Top R&B/Hip Hop album charts and also reached gold & later platinum status in the U.S. The follow-up ''[[My Own (album)|My Own]]'' was released independently of No Limit on Priority, and although it charted on both the Billboard 200 and the Top R&B & Hip-Hop albums charts, it failed to make similar waves as its predecessor.<ref>(nd) [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=young bleed|chart=all}} Young Bleed: Artist Chart History] ''Billboard Magazine''.  Retrieved 6/18/07.</ref>

While in the process of recording his third solo album with Priority, ''Vintage'', Young Bleed was released from his contract and forced to go independent. He joined [[C-Bo]]'s West Coast Mafia Records and released ''[[Rise Thru da Ranks from Earner Tugh Capo]]'' in 2005 and ''[[Once Upon a Time in Amedica]]''<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/artist/431665/young-bleed/chart?f=335 Top Rap Albums] ''Billboard Magazine''. Retrieved 6/01/2016.</ref> in 2007.

On September 23, 2008, Young Bleed released his fifth album, ''Off Tha Curb''. It is a collaborative album with the up-and-coming rapper Freize.

Young Bleed was signed to a [[Strange Music]]<ref>Paine, Jake (June 23, 2011) [http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15691/title.strange-music-tech-n9ne-sign-former-no-limit-records-star-young-bleed Strange Music & Tech N9ne Sign Former No Limit Records Star Young Bleed]. hiphopdx.com</ref> subsidiary called Strange Lane Records in 2011, and his first album with the label, ''[[Preserved (album)|Preserved]]'', was released on October 11, 2011. On April 24, 2012, it was announced that Young Bleed had been dropped from Strange Music and signed to another label. In late 2012, he announced his newest album, ''All Amedican'', and revealed a release date for October or November 2012. However, the album was pushed back several times. It was due to be released in 2013, but as of 2021, it has not been.

In 2016, Young Bleed announced that he was working on a new studio album. The album was released on January 20, 2017.<ref>[https://hoodcriticmagazine.com/2016/12/07/young-bleed-hints-at-a-new-album-release-to-kick-off-2017/ Young Bleed Hints At New Album Release To Kick Off 2017] ''Hood Critic Magazine''. Retrieved 1/08/2017</ref>

On March 26, 2018 Young Bleed made an announcement that he'd be releasing a new album entitled  ''Wut' Uh' Life''. It was the second project to be released under his Trap Door Entertainment aegis.<ref>[https://hoodcriticmagazine.com/2018/03/26/southern-hip-hop-icon-young-bleed-announces-upcoming-release/ Southern Hip-Hop Icon Young Bleed Announces Upcoming Release] ''Hood Critic Magazine''.
