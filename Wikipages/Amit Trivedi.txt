==Career==
In his younger days, an electronic musical instrument fascinated Trivedi and he was slowly drawn towards music, mainly influenced by classical music. At 19–20, he began composing music. In college days, he joined the band Om, who performed at local gigs, small shows and live performances. They struck gold when Times Music took notice at one of their shows, and offered to launch their album. The album however did not fare well, due to lack of promotion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radioandmusic.com/content/editorial/just-talk/amit-trivedi-i-dont-believe-stars-are-needed-make-music-a-hit |title=Amit Trivedi – 'I don't believe stars are needed to make the music a hit' &#124; Editorial-Just Talk |publisher=Radioandmusic.com |date=14 January 2010 |access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> Eventually Trivedi went on to compose for theatre (Hindi, English and Gujarati plays), [[background music]] for television shows, programming for some Marathi films, live performances, [[Dandiya Raas|dandiya shows]], orchestras etc. He also had a brief stint composing advertisement jingles, for brands such as [[McDonald's]] and [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2008/jul/21amit.htm |title=Making music, from Aamir to Dev.D |work=Rediff.com |date=31 December 2004 |access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> After sound engineer and Audio Garage Recording Studio owner Arvind Vishwakarma introduced Trivedi to [[Sony BMG]], he began composing music for non-film albums. As a part of his two-year contract, Trivedi composed some tracks for [[Abhijeet Sawant]]'s ''[[Junoon - Abhijeet Sawant|Junoon]]'' and one song in [[Prashant Tamang]]'s debut album. He arranged for many musicians including Amartya Rahut for a Marathi film Uttarayan in 2004.

[[Film music]] eventually came his way, when friend and playback singer [[Shilpa Rao]] suggested his name to film director [[Anurag Kashyap]]. The latter was in search of a new composer with a distinct vision for his next film. After meeting Trivedi, Kashyap offered him the chance to compose the soundtrack to ''[[Dev.D]]''. Although it was scheduled to be his debut, ''Dev.D'' ran into production delays and was shelved for some time.

Upon Kashyap's recommendation, Trivedi was roped in to score [[Raj Kumar Gupta]]'s directorial venture ''[[Aamir (film)|Aamir]]''. Trivedi and Gupta worked on making the soundtrack fuse with the film narrative, resulting in an effort that garnered critical recognition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bollywoodhungama.com/movies/musicreview/13807/index.html |title=Aamir : Music Review by Joginder Tuteja |publisher=Bollywoodhungama.com |access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbollywood.com/displayReview.php?id=m060908043227 |title=Aamir – music review by Gianysh Toolsee |publisher=Planet Bollywood |date=25 May 2008 |access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref>

By the end of 2008, ''[[Dev.D]]'' was finally released. The soundtrack, released in December, consisted of 18 tracks of different genres. Trivedi dubbed the soundtrack the "baap (father) of different genres". He sang five songs on the soundtrack, and wrote the lyrics for one ("Aankh Micholi"). He shot to fame with the unusual music of ''Dev.D'', giving many chartbusters like "Emosanal Attyachar", "Saali Khushi", "O Pardesi" and many more.
