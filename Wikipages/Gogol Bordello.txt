'''Gogol Bordello''' is an American [[punk rock]] band from the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], formed in 1999 by musicians from all over the world and known for theatrical stage shows and persistent touring. Much of the band's sound is inspired by [[Gypsy style|Romani music]]{{efn|the original article name contains a slur against Roma people, and has thus been changed on here while separate renaming protocol is in order. This also applies to the template on the right, the hyperlink under the name "Romani" and "Romani punk" both redirect to pages with said slur, and are being handled respectively, while this is problem is also seen in various other references on this article and others.}}<sup>(please read reference, has disclaimers)</sup> mixed with [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[dub music|dub]], incorporating [[accordion]] and [[violin]] (and on some albums, [[saxophone]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/15/worldmusic4|title=Meet Gogol Bordello, the gypsy-punk oddballs bringing the sexy back|last=Boden|first=Sarah|date=2008-06-14|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>

The band has appeared in several popular films, most notably ''[[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]'' (2005) in which lead singer [[Eugene Hütz]] co-starred with [[Elijah Wood]] in a [[dramedy]]/adventure story about the [[The Holocaust in Ukraine|Nazi purges in Ukraine]]. The group appears playing a [[brass band]] in a set that included the "[[Star-Spangled Banner]]" and the traditional [[Yiddish song]] "Bublitschki". Gogol Bordello contributed the song "[[Start Wearing Purple]]" to the film's score. The band is the focus of the 2008 documentary ''[[Gogol Bordello Non-Stop]]''. The band recorded the song "Let's Get Crazy" for [[Coca-Cola]]'s [[Euro 2012]] advertising campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://relevant.at/kultur/musik/550833/gogol-bordello-liefern-coca-cola-hymne-zur-em.story |title=Gogol Bordello liefern "Coca-Cola-Hymne" zur EM |publisher=Relevant.at |access-date=2012-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121128090328/http://relevant.at/kultur/musik/550833/gogol-bordello-liefern-coca-cola-hymne-zur-em.story |archive-date=2012-11-28 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History and influences==
"Gogol" comes from [[Nikolai Gogol]], a classical Ukrainian writer. He serves as an ideological influence for the band because he "smuggled" Ukrainian culture into Russian society, which Gogol Bordello intends to do with Romani/East-European music in the English-speaking world.<ref name="NPR">{{cite episode | title = Gogol Bordello: Music from 'Gypsy Punks' | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5371385 | series = In Performance | airdate = 2006-04-29 }}</ref> "[[Bordello]]", in [[Italian language|Italian]], refers to a brothel or a "gentleman's club". The band was originally titled Hütz and the Béla Bartóks, but Eugene Hütz says that they decided to change the name because "nobody knows who the hell [[Béla Bartók]] is in the United States."<ref name="NPR"/> The band played their first show as the unofficial band at an after-hours club called ''Pizdetz'' where they became the house band and DJ Hütz became the house DJ.<ref name="NPR"/>

Gogol Bordello's first [[single (music)|single]] was released in 1999, and since then they have released six full-length [[albums]], and one [[Extended play|EP]]. In 2005 the band signed to [[Punk rock|punk]] label [[SideOneDummy Records]]. On 27 April 2010 Gogol Bordello made its major record label debut with ''[[Transcontinental Hustle]]'' on [[Rick Rubin]]'s [[American Recordings (US)|American Recordings]], a subsidiary of [[Columbia Records]]/[[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Many of the songs on ''Transcontinental Hustle'' were inspired by Hütz's move to Brazil.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.nthword.com/issue7/Gogol_Bordello_Exclusive_Interview_by_Gina_Ponce.php | title = Gogol Bordello: nthWORD Exclusive | last = Ponce | first = Gina | date = August 2010 | website = nthWORD Magazine | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100918015906/http://www.nthword.com/issue7/Gogol_Bordello_Exclusive_Interview_by_Gina_Ponce.php | archive-date = 2010-09-18 }}</ref>

The band has toured extensively throughout [[Europe]] and [[United States|America]]. They have made numerous appearances at international festivals and have toured with such diverse bands as [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Flogging Molly]], and [[Cake (band)|Cake]]. In an interview with [[NPR]], frontman [[Eugene Hütz]] cites [[Jimi Hendrix]] and [[Parliament-Funkadelic]] as among the band's main musical influences.<ref name="NPR"/> They have also mentioned [[Manu Chao]], [[Fugazi]], [[Zvuki Mu]], [[Karamelo Santo]], [[Sasha Kolpakov]] and [[The Clash]] as influences.

They performed live at the [[Bonnaroo]] Music and Arts festival 2011 for Bonnaroo's 10 year anniversary, playing a 1.5 hour set in the middle of the night and performed with [[Devotchka]].

Gogol Bordello released "Let's Get Crazy" in 2012, the new song was part of [[Coca-Cola]]'s advertising campaign for the [[UEFA Euro 2012|European Football Championships]], which were part-hosted by [[Ukraine]]. The track samples one of their earlier singles, "[[Wonderlust King]]", and the Coca-Cola advertising jingle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heute.at/freizeit/musik/art31330,715048 |title=Gogol Bordello: "Let's geht Crazy" mit der Hymne der Euro 2012 |publisher=Heute.at |date=2012-05-22 |access-date=2012-09-05}}</ref>

In 2012 former guitarist Oren Kaplan sued Hütz for personal damages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/2013/08/gogol-bordello-eugene-hutz-sued-stealing/|title=Gogol Bordello's Eugene Hutz Sued for Allegedly Stealing $500,000 From Band|last=Reilly|first=Dan|date=2013-08-01|website=Spin|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/01/gogol-bordello-eugene-hutz-sued-band-accounts|title=Gogol Bordello frontman Eugene Hutz sued over alleged hole in band accounts|last=Michaels|first=Sean|date=2013-08-01|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>
