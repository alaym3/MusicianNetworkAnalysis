Born and raised in [[Windsor, Ontario]], Tamia performed in various singing and dancing competitions as a child. In 1994, after signing a development deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]], she was asked by veteran producer [[Quincy Jones]] to appear on his album ''[[Q's Jook Joint]]'' (1995), earning her [[Grammy Award]] nominations for their collaboration on "[[You Put a Move on My Heart]]" and "[[Slow Jams]]."<ref name="vibe1"/> Her [[Tamia (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released in 1998 and followed by a series of successful albums with [[Elektra Records]], including ''[[A Nu Day]]'' (2000) and  ''[[More (Tamia album)|More]]'' (2004). Several songs from these albums became hit singles on the pop and R&B record charts, including "[[So Into You (Tamia song)|So Into You]]", "[[Stranger in My House (Tamia song)|Stranger in My House]]" and "[[Imagination (Tamia song)|Imagination]]" as well as her collaborations "[[Into You (Fabolous song)|Into You]]", "[[Missing You (Brandy, Gladys Knight, Tamia, and Chaka Khan song)|Missing You]]" and "[[Spend My Life with You]]".

Since her departure from Elektra, Tamia has released most of her projects independently on her own label [[Plus One Music Group]], through ventures with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], [[eOne Music]] and others. In 2015, her sixth album ''[[Love Life (Tamia album)|Love Life]]'' debuted and peaked at number two on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]], becoming her highest-charting album on the chart.

As early as age six, she was on stage singing at the local church, and by age 12, had already been involved in several musicals which helped hone her musical skills.<ref name="ebony"/> Tamia studied piano and voice with renowned Windsor musician, Eugene Davis, who was also instrumental in encouraging her to pursue her vocal talent.<ref name="windsorlife"/> It was not long before she was able to develop her skills in the Walkerville Centre for Creative Arts program for visual and performing arts students, introduced at [[Walkerville Collegiate Institute]] in Windsor.<ref name="windsorlife"/>

Along with attending high school at Walkerville, she made several appearances in local theater and choral concerts before winning Canada's prestigious [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]] Vocal Achievement Award in 1993.<ref name="ebony"/> In 1994, Tamia performed at a [[multiple sclerosis]] benefit in [[Aspen, Colorado]] when she met music manager, [[Lionel Richie]]'s ex-wife Brenda Richie, who was cosponsoring the event and introduced herself to Tamia after the show.<ref name="vibe1">{{cite web|date=June 1, 1998|title=Canadian-born Bombshell|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAojAQAAMAAJ&q=Today,+though,+her+days+of+eating+man-grafted+flesh+are+gone.+Now+Tamia+counts+her+blessings|access-date=July 22, 2018}}</ref> A few months later, Tamia, who was being courted by [[Warner Bros.
