==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}
Daniel was born on October 4, 1980. Fabian was born on July 1, 1984. Alejandro was born on October 4, 1986. The three attended Pine View High School. Fabian and Daniel played basketball while Alejandro sang in the choir and was named Mr. Pine View.

The brothers first came together as a band in 2004 when Alejandro (lead vocals, guitar, piano), Fabian (guitar, vocals), and their older brother Daniel (bass, percussion, vocals) reconnected after pursuing their respective educational goals. While music was always a part of their lives and ultimately their collective goal, pursuing a higher education was also important to the brothers. After graduating from [[Harvard Law School]], Daniel moved back to Florida, to join his brothers Fabian and Alejandro, who were both attending classes at the [[University of Florida]]. It was there that the brothers continued to write music and to perform local shows, and took their most formative steps toward becoming a band. In 2007, in an effort to share their music and ideas with the world, the band decided to start filming and posting videos on YouTube of their own songs and some of their favorite songs by other artists. Some of the first few videos they posted included acoustic versions of songs such as [[Justin Timberlake]]'s "LoveStoned", [[Rihanna]]'s "Umbrella", and [[Coldplay]]'s "Viva la Vida", among many others. To date, the band has over 5 billion views on [[YouTube]] and over 14 million subscribers to their channel.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/boyceavenue |title=YouTube Channel}}</ref>

The band booked a stand-alone show in [[New York City]] in January 2009, for their first ever performance in the city, with the show selling out and receiving positive reviews. Since then, the band has toured the world over with similar results. In early 2009, the band performed for an estimated total of 25,000 fans over four headline shows in the [[Philippines]]. Following this, the band launched headline tours in the US, Canada, and Europe. Their tour in Summer/Fall of 2011 saw the band playing headline shows in Indonesia, Australia, the US, Canada, and Europe, and playing in iconic rooms throughout the world, such as the Fillmore in San Francisco, Webster Hall in New York, the Riviera Theatre in Chicago, the Sound Academy in Toronto, Shepherd's Bush in London, The Olympia Theatre in Dublin, and Live Music Hall in Cologne.

The band recorded original music for their full-length debut album, ''All We Have Left'', over their first years as an ensemble, and it was released in 2010 through their own label, 3 Peace Records. The lead singles from the album were "Every Breath", "On My Way", and "Broken Angel". The music video for "Every Breath", the first single from the album, was directed by Zach Merch (''Blue October'', ''Safetysuit'') in [[Los Angeles]], and was a collaborative effort that grew from a treatment written by the band. ''All We Have Left'' was entirely written, funded, and produced by the band.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://boyceavenue.com/biography/# |title=Archived copy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211051119/http://boyceavenue.com/biography/# |archive-date=2015-02-11 |access-date=2015-02-01}}</ref>

==Career==

===2004–2009: Formation and debut album===
