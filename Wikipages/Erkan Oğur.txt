Erkan Oğur was born on 17 April 1954, in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]]. He spent his childhood in [[Elazığ]], eastern Turkey,<REF NAME="Martinelli" /> where he became interested in [[violin]] and the Turkish ''[[bağlama]]'' lute, and started to practice them frequently. He graduated from high school in Elazığ, then moved to study physics at the Ankara University Faculty of Science from 1970 to 1973.<REF NAME="Martinelli" /> As a result of encouragement to be a scientist by his father, he started to study physics engineering and in 1974 continued his education in The Ludwig-Maximilians University Munich, [[Germany]], for three years. He was introduced to [[guitar]] education in 1973. Instead of being a scientist, he chose to be a musician. Since he needed detailed sounds from a guitar in order to obtain Turkish melodies, he modified his guitar and invented the fretless [[classical guitar]] in 1976.<REF NAME="Martinelli" /><REF NAME="Unfretted" />

In 1980, he returned to Turkey, and started to study at the State Conservatory of [[Istanbul Technical University]].<REF NAME="Martinelli" /> After his military service, he worked as an ''[[oud]]'' lute teacher. He had live performances with [[Fikret Kızılok]] and [[Bülent Ortaçgil]] where he contributed to scene with fretless guitar. He released his first album in Germany called ''Arayışlar'' ''("Searches")''. In 1989, he went to the [[United States|U.S.]] to work with numerous local blues artists, foremost of which was Robert 'One Man' Johnson. He introduced fretless guitar into [[blues]].<REF NAME="Martinelli" /> A year later, he released his first album in Turkey, ''Bir Ömürlük Misafir'' ("A Lifetime Guest"), which was ranked 4th in European lists. He still performs concerts through the world and in Turkey. He works with [[Kemal Eroglu]] on technical improvements on ''bağlama'' lute; and continues his performances with [[Fahir Atakoglu]] and Bülent Ortaçgil. In 2004, he played on [[Yansımalar]]'s album ''Pervane'' ''("Moth")''. He is a member of the [[Telvin]] trio, which mainly performs Turkish folk music in improvised jazz style, with [[İlkin Deniz]] and [[Turgut Alp Bekoglu]],<REF NAME="Martinelli" /> and has released an album called ''Telvin'' in 2006.

His soundtrack for the 2004 movie ''Yazı Tura'' by [[Uğur Yücel]] won two awards: the 2004 Golden Orange for Best Music at the [[Antalya Golden Orange Film Festival]], and the 2005 award for Best Music at the [[Ankara International Film Festival]].
