Every phase, Jack may be slightly different but never lost the "Jack” quality – which encapsulates two qualities: young and popular. Until Hoa Hai Duong, in terms of music, Jack is still Jack. He is quiet, not good at speaking but in music, the audience often feels that this is "his heaven" where he unleashes his soul and sentences. Keeping his identity is a good thing. He still lives discreet, unbearable, uncolorful. In turn, in music, Jack is gradually gaining more love from fans."<ref name="Lê Thị Mỹ Niệm">{{cite web|url=https://vietnamnet.vn/vn/giai-tri/nhac/hoa-hai-duong-cua-jack-co-gi-hay-676016.html|title='Hoa Hai Duong' của Jack có gì hay?|author=Lê Thị Mỹ Niệm |website=vietnamnet.vn| language=vi| trans-title=What is in MV Hoa Hai Duong of Jack?}}</ref>}}
