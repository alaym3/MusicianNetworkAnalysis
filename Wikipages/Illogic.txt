In 2012, he released an EP titled ''Preparing for Capture'', which was entirely produced by [[Blockhead (music)|Blockhead]] in preparation for their upcoming full-length album, ''Capture the Sun''. Speaking on the collaboration, Illogic said, "We have worked hard to really try to find our own identity as a duo and not to try recreate what I've done with other producers and what he has done with other artists." After the success of ''Preparing'' ''for'' ''Capture'', they proceeded to release a sequel to the EP, ''Preparing for Capture 2.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/stream-illogic-and-blockheads-new-ep-preparing-for/65998/|title=Stream Illogic And Blockhead's New EP 'Preparing For Capture'|publisher=Prefix|first=Matthew|last=Ellis|date=June 6, 2012}}</ref>
