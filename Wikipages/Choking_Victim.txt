'''Choking Victim''' is an American [[Punk rock|punk]] band formed in [[New York City]], which lasted from 1992 to 1998. They played a mix of [[hardcore punk]] and [[ska]] (sometimes known as [[ska-core]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/Choking-Victim/1892/ |title=Choking Victim |publisher=[[Sputnik Music]] |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> Following the breakup of the band, which occurred the same day as the recording of their only studio album ''[[No Gods, No Managers]]'', members went on to form [[Leftöver Crack]] and INDK, among others.

==Background==
The band became well-known at the [[C-Squat]] in the Lower East Side of [[Manhattan]] for their innovative music and politically charged lyrics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/bands/chokingvictim |title=Choking Victim |publisher=Punknews.org |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref>  They also became infamous for their [[Satanism|Satanic]] imagery and references to the vagrant lifestyle, including smoking both [[crack cocaine]] and [[marijuana]], [[shoplifting]], and [[squatting]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Choking+Victim |title=Choking Victim – bio |website=[[Last.fm]] |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> The band prides itself on its [[atheism]], and makes frequent references to [[Satan]]. On the album ''No Gods, No Managers'', they use excerpts from the lectures of political scientist [[Michael Parenti]].

=== Breakup ===
Choking Victim broke up after the first day of recording for their first full-length LP,  ''[[No Gods, No Managers]]'', but the recordings from that one day were enough to make a full album. After they broke up, [[Stza]] formed the band [[Leftöver Crack]], and Skwert and Ezra formed INDK. Ezra joined Leftover Crack in 2001. Skwert is currently the front man for the NJ based ska punk band Public Serpents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/18448/skwert-choking-victim-american-distress-forms-public-serpents-posts-song|title=Skwert (Choking Victim, American Distress) forms Public Serpents, posts song|website=Punknews.org|accessdate=2020-03-28}}</ref> Sascha has spent the last several years [[organic farming|organically farming]] in upstate NY, and is a founding member of [[Icarus Project]], a radical mental health network.

=== Reunions ===
On November 11, 2000, Choking Victim reunited to play a show in Tompkins Square Park with the lineup from their album, substituting former bassist Alec for Shayne. Later, in late 2005, Choking Victim reunited a second time, performing four shows. On June 11, 2006, they played a show at the [[Lower East Side]]'s [[Tompkins Square Park]], which featured various political speakers, including members of the Mislead Youth Project. At the end of July 2006, they toured the Dominican Republic,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/17508/choking-victim-dominican-republic |title=Choking Victim (Dominican Republic) |website=Punknews.org |date=May 14, 2006 |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref> before [[Leftöver Crack]] embarked on their European Tour.

In the Summer of 2012, lead singer Stza enlisted the help of Irish Ska/Punk band Chewing on Tinfoil and formed "The Choking Victim Show". This band, playing the songs of Choking Victim, toured throughout the UK, Ireland and France<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/48213/tours-choking-victim-chewing-on-tinfoil |title=Choking Victim / Chewing on Tinfoil |author=Aubin Paul |publisher=Punknews.org |date=July 24, 2012 |accessdate=August 21, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livemusic.fm/band/choking-victim |publisher=[[Livemusic]] |title=Choking Victim |accessdate=July 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161110043900/http://livemusic.fm/band/choking-victim |archive-date=November 10, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Choking Victim Show |url=http://www.songkick.com/artists/5539968-choking-victim-show |publisher=[[Songkick]] |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://punknews.tumblr.com/post/27920126530/on-tour-choking-victim-chewing-on-tinfoil |title=Choking Victim / Chewing on Tinfoil: on tour |work=punknews.tumblr.com |publisher=[[Tumblr]] |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/rebellion/2012uk/ |title=Rebellion UK 2012 |work=[[EFestivals|efestivals.co.uk]] |accessdate=July 11, 2012}}</ref>

Choking Victim has continued to play sporadic concerts worldwide between 2014 and 2017. Prior to 2017 these were one-off events, but, in 2017, they undertook their first tour in over a decade.

=== Legacy ===
In addition to [[Leftöver Crack]] and INDK, Choking Victim also spawned Public Serpents, [[Morning Glory (band)|Morning Glory]] and the Crack Rock Steady 7. Choking Victim have reformed for a few dates in the UK and Europe as The Choking Victim Show with Stza, Sascha, Alec and Ezra.
