'''Galimatias''' (born Matias Saabye Køedt)<ref>{{cite web|title=New band of the week: Alina Baraz & Galimatias (No 58) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/19/new-band-of-the-week-alina-baraz-galimatias-no-58 |website=theguardian.com |date=19 June 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2020}}</ref> is an [[electronic music]] artist from the small town of [[Fredericia]] in [[Rural area|rural]] [[Denmark]]. He currently resides in [[Los Angeles|Los Angeles, CA.]] Galimatias is most known for his 2015 EP ''Urban Flora'' with American singer-songwriter [[Alina Baraz]].

==Career==
Galimatias began making music as a teenager, and produced tracks for Danish hip-hop acts around the turn of the 2010s.
In 2012, he released two EPs of mellow, downtempo instrumentals: ''Luna Soul'' and ''Sunlight Reigns Supreme''.

He began working with [[Alina Baraz]] after they were introduced to each other through [[SoundCloud]] in 2013, and their songs immediately received blog attention. Their collaborations were collected on an eight-song EP titled ''Urban Flora'', which was released digitally by [[Ultra Music|Ultra Records]] in 2015, with a vinyl release by [[Mom + Pop Music|Mom + Pop]] following in 2016. [[Felix Jaehn]]'s remix of their song "Fantasy" appeared on many dance compilations.
Following its release, praise for the EP began to pour in from publications such as [[The Fader|FADER]], [[NPR]], [[Earmilk]], [[Dancing Astronaut]], and [[HuffPost|Huffington Post.]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Galimatias And Alina Baraz Debut "Can I" |url=https://www.thefader.com/2015/04/23/galimatias-and-alina-baraz-debut-can-i |website=thefader.com |date=23 April 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Songs We Love: Alina Baraz & Galimatias, 'Unfold' |url=https://www.npr.org/2015/05/27/409853231/songs-we-love-alina-baraz-galimatias-unfold |website=npr.org |date=27 May 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive Interview And Tea Party With Galimatias & Alina Baraz |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/exclusive-interview-and-t_b_7843048 |website=huffpost.com |date=21 July 2015 |accessdate=8 June 2020}}</ref>

On 15 June 2017, Galimatias released the single "Let Me Know". The song consists of different layers of [[beatboxing]] through [[vocoder]]s, mixed into a harmony that also serves as a rhythm throughout the track.

In an interview with ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', Galimatias stated "I haven't released anything for two years but that didn't mean I stopped making music. I tuned out from social media for a year as well and people started sending me messages asking if I was still alive. I'm definitely not dead, but I don't ever want to create the same sound twice, and it took a good while for me to figure out what I wanted to do after ''Urban Flora''. I have a lot of criteria for myself when I make music, and creating something that hasn't been heard before is definitely one of the highest ranking ones."<ref>{{cite web|title=Premiere: Listen to Galimatias' New Song "Let Me Know" |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2017/06/galimatias-let-me-know |website=complex.com |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=8 June 2020}}</ref>
