'''True Widow''' is an American rock band formed in 2007 and based in [[Dallas]], Texas. The band's expansive guitar-driven sound has led them to be cited  as "drop-tuned, slow, repetitive, heavy, dreamy, and undeniably ear-wormy".<ref>{{cite news |last=Richards |first=Kathleen |date=2011-09-14 |title=The True Widow Aesthetic |url=https://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/the-true-widow-aesthetic/Content?oid=2987103 |work=East Bay Express |location=[[Oakland, California|Oakland]] |accessdate=2020-10-11}}</ref> True Widow has been known for contrasting alternation between male and female vocals. To date, the band has released four albums, their eponymous album ''True Widow'' (2008), ''As High As the Highest Heavens and From the Center to the Circumference of the Earth'' (2011), ''[[Circumambulation (album)|Circumambulation]]'' (2013), and after extensive touring, they released ''Avvolgere'' (2016).
