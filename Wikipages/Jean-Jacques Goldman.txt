== Biography ==
Born in Paris to an immigrant [[Polish Jew]]ish father, [[Alter Mojze Goldman]] (born in [[Lublin]]) and a [[German Jew]]ish mother, Ruth Ambrunn (born in [[Munich]]), Jean-Jacques Goldman was the third of four children. As a child, he began his music studies on the violin, then the piano. In 1968, he abandoned his classical music studies for "American Rock & Roll" as well as folk music, listening to [[The Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] or [[Aretha Franklin]], and emphasizing the guitar.<ref>His "conversion" is loosely chronicled in the song ''Un, deux, trois''</ref> He also earned a business degree from the [[EDHEC Business School (Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales du Nord)|École des hautes études commerciales du Nord]], commonly known as ''EDHEC'', in [[Lille]]. In 1972, he met Catherine, his first wife, with whom he had three children. He first entered the French music scene as a member of a [[progressive rock]] group named [[Taï Phong]] ("great wind", "[[typhoon]]" in Vietnamese), which released its first album in 1975. Their first song to be a moderate hit was "Sister Jane". After three albums in English (on which he sang and played guitar as well as violin), Goldman was determined to write and sing in French, which led him to leave the band.

Marc Lumbroso saw his potential and managed to sign him a five-album contract with [[Epic Records]]. That same year he released his first album, which he wanted to call ''[[Démodé]]'' ("old-fashioned", "out of trend"), but the label refused so it was left untitled (although "Démodé" is now its unofficial title). "''[[Il suffira d'un signe]]''" was his first significant success. In 1982, he released a second album with no title – this time the intended title was ''[[Minoritaire]]'', which was also refused as it was deemed un-commercial (and has likewise become its unofficial title). It featured several hits: "''Quand la musique est bonne''", "''Comme toi''" (inspired by a picture of a young Jewish girl who died in a [[Holocaust victims|concentration camp]] although the heartfelt lyrics never explicitly mention this specific historical context), "''Au bout de mes rêves''", and was his breakthrough album, with about 900.000 units sold. His third album in 1984, the first with an official title, ''[[Positif (album)|Positif]]'' (chosen as an ironic response to the refusal of the intended "negative" titles of his first two), contained new hits such as "''Encore un matin''" and "''[[Envole-moi]]''", and performed even better with about 1.000.000 units sold. His fourth album, ''[[Non homologué]]'' ("not approved", which continued his trend of ironically self-depreciative titles) garnered the hit songs "''[[Je marche seul]]''", "''[[Je te donne (song)|Je te donne]]''" (a bilingual rock duet with [[Michael Jones (Welsh-French musician)|Michael Jones]] with Jones singing the English verses and Goldman the French ones) and "''[[Pas toi]]''". He recorded a [[double album]] in 1987, ''[[Entre gris clair et gris foncé]]'' ("Between light grey and dark grey"), which launched a string of hits — "''Elle a fait un bébé toute seule''", "''[[Puisque tu pars]]''", "[[Là-bas (song)|''Là-bas'']]" (a duet with [[Sirima]]), "''Il changeait la vie''" — and was a major success, with more than 2 million units sold.

Yet most critics were harsh, deriding his high-pitched voice, his style and demeanour (described as tame and innocuous) and his soft songs presumably marketed for teenage girls. In reaction, at the end of 1985, he purchased a full page in two major newspapers (''[[Libération]]'' and ''[[France-Soir|France Soir]]''), displaying excerpts from his harshest reviews, with an ironic message to his fans at the end, again demonstrating his taste for unassuming self-promotion: "Thanks for coming anyway..." ("Merci d'être venus quand même...").<ref>Yves Bigot, ''Je t'aime, moi non plus. Les amours de la chanson'', Don Quichotte, 2016, p. 179</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.parler-de-sa-vie.net/ecrits/interviews/1986xx06.php|title=Jean-Jacques Goldman : l'anti-star de la chanson (?, 1986)|website=www.parler-de-sa-vie.net|access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.autrepart.info/jean-jacques-goldman/jean-jacques-goldman-pour-les-nuls.html|title=Autrepart – Jean-Jacques Goldman – JJG pour les nuls|website=www.autrepart.info|access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref>

From 1990 to 1995, he went on to perform in a trio called [[Fredericks Goldman Jones|Fredericks / Goldman / Jones]] with [[Carole Fredericks]] (an American singer and chorist who had settled in France in the 1970s, the sister of [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]) and [[Michael Jones (Welsh-French musician)|Michael Jones]] (a Welsh guitarist and singer who had settled in his mother's native France, whom Goldman knew from Taï Phong—actually he joined the band when Goldman decided to stop touring—and with whom he had a hit in 1985 with "''Je te donne''"). Together they recorded two studio albums, ''[[Fredericks Goldman Jones (album)|Fredericks / Goldman / Jones]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Rouge (Fredericks Goldman Jones album)|Rouge]]'' in 1993 (inspired by the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] and the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of the USSR]]—the title song features the [[Alexandrov Ensemble|Red Army Choir]]), one live album, ''[[Du New Morning au Zénith]]'', and released several successful singles, such as "[[Nuit (song)|''Nuit'']]", "''[[À nos actes manqués]]''", "''[[Né en 17 à Leidenstadt]]''" (another song about war and how it affects people's lives), "''Juste après''" (inspired by a scene in a TV documentary about the work of [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] in [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]] showing a missionary sister's harrowing struggle to reanimate a newborn<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tenbunderen.be/namenlijst.html |title=namenlijst van de missionarissen in Congo van de Zusters van Ten Bunderen uit Moorslede |website=www.tenbunderen.be |access-date=24 January 2019}}</ref>) and "''[[Tu manques]]''". Several of these songs were later re-recorded in English, but did not find much success in England or the United States.

From 1997 to 2003 he returned to performing as a solo act, releasing two albums, ''[[En passant (Jean-Jacques Goldman album)|En passant]]'' in 1997 and ''[[Chansons pour les pieds]]'' in 2001, as well as two live albums, ''Tournée 98 En passant'' and ''[[Un tour ensemble]]'', with new hit songs like "''On ira''", "''Quand tu danses''", "''Sache que je''", "''Bonne idée''", "''Tournent les violons''", "''Ensemble''", "''Les choses''", "''Et l'on n'y peut rien''". After a last concert in 2004, he suddenly stopped performing and recording, saying he wanted to spend more time with his family (he had remarried in 2001, to a young fan who was then studying mathematics and later got a PhD in [[pure mathematics]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.idref.fr/118247549 |title=Lagier, Nathalie Goldman }}</ref> In 2011, to shut down rumors about a possible comeback, he published a short text denying any plan of a new album or tour in the foreseeable future,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.20minutes.fr/culture/647826-20110105-culture-info-20minutesfr-jean-jacques-goldman-dement-tout-projet-album |title=Info 20minutes.fr: Jean-Jacques Goldman dément tout projet d'album |website=www.20minutes.fr |language=fr |access-date=23 January 2019}}</ref> and remains elusive, largely absent from the media.<ref name=":0" />

He continued to compose and produce a few songs for other artists, though, sometimes lending his voice as part of a collaboration. For example, he recorded "''[[4 Mots sur un piano]]''" with [[Patrick Fiori]] and Christine Ricol in 2007; it was a significant hit.

Jean-Jacques Goldman also had a prominent role in French charity acts from the middle of the 1980s, when in 1985 famous comedian [[Coluche]] asked him to write a song to promote the initiative he just created, [[Restaurants du Cœur|Les restos du coeur]], meant to provide food to poor people during the winter months; Goldman crafted and produced the eponymous song (reportedly written/composed in three days), then with Coluche they brought in other French celebrities (actors [[Yves Montand]], [[Catherine Deneuve]] and [[Nathalie Baye]], soccer player [[Michel Platini]], TV host [[Michel Drucker]]) to perform it as an extended troupe (akin to "[[We Are the World|''We are the world'']]", each singing a verse, or rather reciting, as none of them were trained singers), called [[Les Enfoirés]] (originally a very crude and offensive word, literally translatable as "covered in diarrhea", commonly meaning "the bastards" or "the assholes", which was a [[gimmick]] of Coluche in his shows and has been somewhat watered down over the years, akin to "motherfucker"). After Coluche's death in 1986, he took over and became the main organizer of the annual charity concert and record, a role he kept fulfilling until 2016, when he decided to quit, after a song he wrote for that year's charity album, "''Toute la vie''", sparked controversy for its lyrics, which were deemed "reactionary", with an unfair portrayal of current youth and a pointless opposition between "young" and "old" generations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/04/world/song-for-french-charity-strikes-discordant-note.html |title="Toute la vie": Song for French charity strikes discordant note |last=Rubin |first=Alissa J. |date=3 March 2015 |work=The New York Times |access-date=23 January 2019 |last2=Breeden |first2=Aurelien |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Throughout his career, Goldman has frequently composed for other singers (sometimes using pseudonyms), most notably [[Johnny Hallyday]] (the whole ''[[Gang (album)|Gang]]'' album in 1985, among his most successful) and [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]]. He wrote and produced two whole albums for her: ''[[D'eux]]'' in 1995 (released in the US as ''The French Album''), which is still the best selling French album in history with 10 million copies sold worldwide, and ''[[S'il suffisait d'aimer]]'' in 1998. He also worked with her on the album ''[[1 fille & 4 types]]'' along with [[Gildas Arzel]], [[Jacques Veneruso]] and [[Erick Benzi]]. The songs "[[Pour que tu m'aimes encore|''If That's What It Takes'']]", "[[Je sais pas|''I Don't Know'']]" and "''Fly''" from her album ''[[Falling into You]]'' are English adaptations of songs Goldman wrote for Céline.<ref>{{cite web |author=Benjamin Jacquot |url=http://www.francebleu.fr/musique/celine-dion/celine-dion-et-goldman-20-ans-d-amitie-889726 |title=Céline Dion et Jean-Jacques Goldman: 20 ans d'amitié |publisher=[[France Bleu]] |date=30 September 2013 |access-date=10 August 2014 |language=fr}}</ref> Also, her song "''[[Let's Talk About Love]]''" from the [[Let's Talk About Love|album of the same name]] is an English adaptation of Goldman's 1987 solo song "''[[Puisque tu pars]]''". He has also collaborated with [[Patricia Kaas]], [[Garou (singer)|Garou]], [[Marc Lavoine]], [[Gérald De Palmas]], [[Patrick Fiori]], [[Khaled (musician)|Khaled]] ("''[[Aïcha]]''"), [[Lorie (singer)|Lorie]] and [[Florent Pagny]], as well as jazzman [[Chet Baker]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}, [[Supertramp]]'s saxophonist [[John Helliwell]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}, [[Joe Cocker]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} ("On my way home" from the album ''[[No Ordinary World]]'' is an adaptation from "[[Là-bas (song)|Là-bas]]"), "king of soul" [[Ray Charles]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} and North American songwriter [[Diane Warren]]{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}.

On 19 November 2012, ''[[Génération Goldman]]'', a tribute album to Goldman, was released on the [[MyMajorCompany]] France and [[M6 Music]] labels, with a number of artists interpreting Goldman's songs. A second volume followed in 2013.

===Personal life===
His half-brother [[Pierre Goldman]], a left-wing intellectual and convicted (though later acquitted) robber, was murdered in mysterious circumstances in 1979 in Paris.<ref>Yair Auron, ''Les juifs d'extrême-gauche en mai 68: une génération révolutionnaire marquée par la Shoah'', Albin Michel, 1998, p. 81</ref>

His younger brother [[Robert Goldman (French songwriter)|Robert Goldman]] is also a songwriter (often known as J. Kapler). His son Michaël Goldman is one of the co-founders of [[My Major Company]] France, a major [[fan-funded music]] label.

==Philanthropy==
