==History==
===Early years and ''This Could Be a Possibility'' (2004–2008)===
Valencia met by playing local shows together around the [[tri-state area]] in separate bands. George Ciukurescu and JD Perry grew up together; attending [[elementary school]], [[high school]], and their first year of [[college]]. They joined a band in 2001 called The Capgun Heroes with Brendan Walter and former members Sean Mundy and Ryan O'Hara. Shane Henderson sang in the band Attracted to Miss and Max played drums in The Emphasis. They formed the band that is known today as Valencia in 2004. The band is named after the wife of the protagonist, Valencia, in the book by [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Slaughterhouse-Five]]. In 2005 Valencia signed to I Surrender Records after the label's owner, [[Midtown (band)|Midtown]]'s drummer Rob Hitt, heard their demo tape.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p290799|pure_url=yes}} Valencia] at [[Allmusic]]</ref>
