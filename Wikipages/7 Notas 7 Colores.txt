==Biography==
7 Notas 7 Colores emerged in Barcelona in 1993, when there were few rap groups in Spain. Its members were from different towns and neighborhoods around the city: [[Mucho Muchacho]] from [[El Prat de Llobregat|El Prat]], Dive Dibosso from [[Sant Andreu|San Andrés/Sant Andreu]] and later member Eddy la Sombra from [[Sabadell]].

In the beginning, only Mucho Muchacho (aka Mucho Mu) was at the [[Rapping|mic]], and Dive Dibosso dealt with the [[Record producer|production]]. They were accompanied by DJ Neas on live performances, but left after the first album was released.

Later, Eddy Drammeh (aka Eddy La Sombra) joined them as a rapper; and they took [[Russia]]n [[DJ Vadim]] behind the [[Phonograph|turntable]]. They made a song with [[Company Flow]]. After that, they started to record their albums in the [[United States]]. They were introduced to the U.S. market by Juan Brujo, from [[Brujeria (band)|Brujeria]].

They had many problems with their label, so they started their own, ''La Mami Internacional'', releasing an album with the same title. After that, they disappeared from the rap scene, although Mucho Muchacho made a solo album, under his own label ''C.R.E.A.M.'', called ''Chulería'', a Spanish word for "cockiness". [[Ray Roll]], [[Tony Touch]] and [[Griffi]] also collaborated in the LP.

Nowadays, Mucho Mu works at a disco in [[Ibiza]] as a DJ.

In 2007, they announced the return of 7 Notas 7 Colores, with a new formation. DJ Vadim will be the producer, along with Mucho Muchacho and Principante, an MC from [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]], who has a solo LP.
