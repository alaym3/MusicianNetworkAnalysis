'''Jets to Brazil''' was an [[United States|American]] [[indie rock]] band from [[Brooklyn, New York]], formed in 1997 and active until 2003.

==History==
Jets to Brazil was founded by [[Blake Schwarzenbach]], former frontman of [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]], and [[Jeremy Chatelain (bassist)|Jeremy Chatelain]], when Schwarzenbach relocated to [[New York City]] after Jawbreaker disbanded. The two began working on four-track recordings aided by [[drum machine]]s until former [[Texas Is the Reason]] drummer Chris Daly joined the band, and they signed to [[Jade Tree Records]]. The origin of the band's name came from a suggestion by Daly, after seeing it on a poster in the 1961&nbsp;film ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]''.

The group's first album, ''[[Orange Rhyming Dictionary]]'', was released on Jade Tree Records in 1998 to critical and commercial success, followed by extensive touring with bands like [[The Promise Ring]]. Their second album, ''[[Four Cornered Night]]'', was released in 2000 to mainly positive reviews. ''Four Cornered Night'' was the first album to feature new [[guitarist]] Brian Maryansky, formerly of the band [[The Van Pelt]]. With Maryansky included in the band, this allowed Schwarzenbach to also become the keyboard player for the band. In 2002, Jets to Brazil released their third and final album, ''[[Perfecting Loneliness]]'', to positive reviews.

By the fall of 2003, less than a year after the release of ''Perfecting Loneliness'', the band broke up for unspecified reasons.

[[Blake Schwarzenbach|Schwarzenbach]] teaches [[English studies|English]] at [[Hunter College]] in New York City and is pursuing a PhD in [[English Literature]]. In October 2008, he started a new band, [[The Thorns of Life]], but was short-lived and broke up in August 2009. Shortly afterwards, Schwarzenbach enlisted [[Against Me!]] drummer [[Kevin Mahon (musician)|Kevin Mahon]] and [[bassist]] Caroline Paquita to form [[Forgetters]] who released an album and started their own record label, Too Small To Fail Records. In 2017, Schwarzenbach reunited with [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/72987-jawbreaker-reunite-after-21-years-for-riot-fest-2017/|title=Jawbreaker Reunite After 21 Years for Riot Fest 2017|website=Pitchfork.com|accessdate=2020-03-26}}</ref>

Daly reunited with Texas Is The Reason for two shows at the [[Irving Plaza]] in New York City in November 2006 and a reunion tour from 2012 to 2013.

"Sweet Avenue", the final track of ''Orange Rhyming Dictionary'', has often been attributed to [[Damien Rice]] due to misattribution on [[peer-to-peer]] networks.

On March 25, 2019, during the Q&A portion a screening of Jawbreaker's documentary ''Don't Break Down'', Schwarzenbach answered a fan question regarding a Jets To Brazil reunion to which he answered it may happen one day but his present main focus is on Jawbreaker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/jawbreaker-documentary-screening-nitehawk-prospect-park-w-band-qa/|title=Jawbreaker documentary screening @ Nitehawk Prospect Park w/ band Q&A|website=BrooklynVegan.com|accessdate=2020-03-26}}</ref>
