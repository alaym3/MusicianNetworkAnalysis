==Biography==
Formed in 1960, the group originally consisted of Sam "Little Sonny" Brown, Eugene "Bird" Daughtry, Phillip "Phil" Terry and Robert "Big Sonny" Edwards.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> In 1969, Sam Brown was replaced as lead singer by [[Bobby Starr]], only to rejoin the group in 1973.

In 1965, when songwriters and record producers Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff first contemplated leaving the [[Cameo-Parkway]] record label to risk launching their own label, the vocalists on which they pinned all their hopes and venture capital were The Intruders. Like many other subsequent acts the duo produced, which included [[Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes]] and [[The O'Jays]], The Intruders had already developed a vocal sound that was both theirs and uniquely ''Philadelphian''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnbshowcasemag.com/intrudersprofile |title=Page Title |publisher=Rnbshowcasemag.com |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

Brown, Daughtry, Terry and Edwards had been [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] and performing one-off [[single (music)|singles]] together since 1961, blending Philly's street corner [[doo-wop]] tradition with black gospel fervor. The result was neither as pop-infected as [[Motown Records|Motown]], nor as [[funk]]y and [[blues]]-inflected as [[Stax Records|Stax]]. The sound which The Intruders refined for the [[Excel Records|Excel]], [[Gamble Records|Gamble]] and [[Philadelphia International Records|Philadelphia International]] imprints reflected a different attitude than either Stax or Motown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soultracks.com/Gamble_and_Huff |title=Gamble and Huff &#124; SoulTracks – Soul Music Biographies, News and Reviews |publisher=SoulTracks |date=September 19, 2005 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

[[Gamble and Huff]]'s success with The Intruders helped convince [[Columbia Records]] to grant them the money to launch Philadelphia International. Gamble and Huff acknowledged that their work with The Intruders was the foundation of what they called "The Sound Of Philadelphia".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/features/special-feature-philadelphia-international-1002689866.story#/features/special-feature-philadelphia-international-1002689866.story |title=Special Feature: Philadelphia International Records |work=Billboard |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Ken Shane |url=http://popdose.com/soul-serenade-the-intruders-together/ |title=Soul Serenade: The Intruders, "Together" |publisher=Popdose.com |date=October 17, 2012 |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>

The Intruders, meanwhile, were undergoing some internal turmoil. When the group resurfaced on the 1970 Gamble LP, ''When We Get Married'', lead singer Brown was replaced by [[Bobby Starr]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://social.zune.net/album/The-Intruders/When-We-Get-Married/8c260000-0400-11db-89ca-0019b92a3933/details |title=Zune Music + Video |publisher=Social.zune.net |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> The title song, "When We Get Married" (R&B No. 8, [[Billboard Hot 100|Pop]] #45), a [[The Dreamlovers|Dreamlovers]] [[cover version|cover]], became a hit on the [[record chart|charts]], as was the follow-up "Win, Place Or Show (She's A Winner)" ([[UK Singles Chart|UK]] #14).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Starr's tenure with the group included ''[[Soul Train]]'' television appearances, and the rare collector's single, "I'm Girl Scoutin".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulfulkindamusic.net/intruders.htm |title=The Intruders |publisher=Soulfulkindamusic.net |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref> Brown returned to the group in 1973 for the album ''[[Save the Children (The Intruders album)|Save The Children]]'', which spawned The Intruders' last two big hits, "I Wanna Know Your Name" (R&B No. 9, Pop #60) and "I'll Always Love My Mama" (R&B No. 6, Pop #36).  Kenny Gamble's mother Ruby, the inspiration for "I'll Always Love My Mama", died March 10, 2012 in [[Mount Airy, Pennsylvania]], at age 96.

==''Cowboys to Girls''... and cover versions==

"[[Cowboys to Girls]]" (R&B No. 1, Pop #6), the only [[record chart|chart topping]] single of their career, was a 1968 Top 10 Pop and R&B smash that was awarded an [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] for one million sales in mid-May 1968.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> 

During the late 1970s and early 1980s, their music was popular on the West Coast among Latino, specifically [[Chicano]], [[adolescence|youth]], as evidenced by their covers by the Hacienda Brothers and Tierra.  Daughtry died of cancer on December 25, 1994 at age 55, and lead singer Sam "Little Sonny" Brown committed suicide by jumping off the [[Strawberry Mansion Bridge]] on April 21, 1995 at age 54.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/23794617|title=Little Sonny (1941–1995) – Find A Grave Memorial|website=Findagrave.com|accessdate=October 26, 2017}}{{Primary source inline|date=December 2019}}</ref> According to Marc Taylor, in the book, "A Touch Of Classic Soul of the Early 1970's" (1996, Aloiv Publishing, Jamaica, New York), in 1975, the other two original Intruders, Robert Edwards and Phil Terry, walked away from the industry after becoming Jehovah's Witnesses.  Edwards died on October 15, 2016 from a heart attack at age 74, leaving Phil Terry as the last surviving original member, as of 2018.

The Intruders today include Bobby Starr, Glenn Montgomery and Phil Gay.  The group is featured on the "My Music" DVD hosted by [[Patti LaBelle]] on [[PBS]] and tour with the Love Train:  Sound of Philadelphia Concert series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phillysoulclassics.com/Love-Train-The-Sound-of-Philadelphia |title=Legacy Recordings &#124; Life Changing Music, Latest News, New Releases |publisher=Phillysoulclassics.com |accessdate=August 19, 2015}}</ref>  There are also several tribute groups, including "The Philly Intruders", who appear on "The Big Show" DVD, and "The Fabulous Intruders", founded by William Payton, Sr.
