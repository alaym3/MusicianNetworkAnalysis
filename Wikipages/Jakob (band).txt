'''Jakob''' is a [[New Zealand]] [[post-rock]] [[musical band|band]], based in the [[Hawkes Bay]] city of [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]].<ref name="Hill">{{cite news|title=Trio takes solace in the Bay life|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&objectid=10413258|first=Rebecca Barry|last=Hill|date=1 December 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|access-date=8 May 2012}}</ref>  The band consists of guitarist Jeff Boyle, bassist Maurice Beckett, and drummer Jason Johnston.<ref name="Hill" /> They have been compared to such bands as [[Mogwai]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[High Dependency Unit (band)|High Dependency Unit]], though they largely eschew any vocals or samples in their songs.

==History==
The band formed in July 1998, and began by opening for [[New Zealand]] bands [[Salmonella Dub]] and [[Pitch Black (band)|Pitch Black]]<ref name="Hill" /> at the local [[pub]] O'Flaherty's.  They toured extensively throughout 1999, releasing that same year a [[Jakob (EP)|self-titled EP]] recorded with David Holmes at Napier's Venn Production Studios.  The year 2000 brought a gig at The Event New Years party in [[Napier, New Zealand|Napier]], and the 7" single ''[[Erfo]]'', a limited release on the Crawlspace Records label.

Jakob returned to Venn Studios in March 2001 to record their debut album with engineer David Holmes (also known from the band ''[[Kerretta]]'').  ''[[Subsets of Sets]]'' was released April 2002 through New Zealand's Midium Records to good reviews and a nomination at the [[BNet NZ Music Awards|bNet independent music awards]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/91877-jakob|title=Jakob - Artist Profile|last=|first=|date=|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-31}}</ref>  Jakob continued touring with artists such as [[High Dependency Unit (band)|HDU]] and fellow Midium artists Avotor and Meterman, as well as playing at the 2002 [[Big Day Out]].

A period of inactivity followed, lasting between six and eight months.  The band didn't play together during that time, and for two months didn't even see each other.  They regrouped in January 2003 with ideas for new songs, and spent a week at The Church studio with David Holmes.  This session was ultimately scrapped, but after more rehearsal final versions of the songs were recorded over two days in March.  ''[[Cale:Drew]]'', their second full-length album, was released in August 2003 and garnered Jakob another [[BNet NZ Music Awards|bNet]] nomination.

International touring followed in 2004, to [[Chicago]] (where they played at studio radio station WXRT), [[Denmark]], and the [[United Kingdom]].  They were well received at every venue, and released a 7" single, ''[[Semaphore (single)|Semaphore]]'', in Europe.  Also that year, they released the one-track mini-album ''[[Dominion (Jakob album)|Dominion]]'', and played a 25-minute set at Radio New Zealand's Helen Young Studios (consisting of the songs Laburnum, Semaphore, Nice Day for an Earthquake, and Jimmy Hoffa).

2005 saw more international touring by Jakob, with the band playing at [[South by Southwest]] in March, and [[Australia]] in September (in support of the release of ''[[Cale:Drew]]'' there) and again in late October (with Australian band [[Cog (band)|Cog]]). It also saw the release of their ''[[The Diffusion of Our Inherent Situation|Diffusion]]''  7" and ''Coalescence'', a 12" compilation from Midium Records, featuring a track by Jakob.

Jakob played concerts all through New Zealand in August 2006 as part of the [[A Low Hum]] tour, and released their third album ''[[Solace (Jakob album)|Solace]]'' in September 2006.

In April 2008 Jakob toured Europe with [[Isis (band)|Isis]] and The Austerity Program, and Australia with [[Cog (band)|Cog]]. They also completed a US tour in the second half of 2008, once again with ISIS.

During 2008 and 2009 members Jeff Boyle and Maurice Beckett worked on other projects. Maurice with his solo project Desbot, and Jeff with a project entitled Mean with H. Walker from Avotor and Kerretta. The debut Mean LP entitled "Knowing" was released in December 2012.{{update after|2011|12|31}}

In March 2010, Jakob announced a four date April tour of NZ, heading in May and June to the US West Coast to support ISIS' tour once again.

In January 2011, they supported [[Tool (band)|Tool]] on their Australian tour.

On 29 April 2013, it was announced via the band's [[Facebook]] page that they were to join Tool again as support act for their [[Vector Arena]] shows.

In October 2013, Jakob featured on the soundtrack for the surf documentary Waverider by Gareth Davies and RedYeti Films, directed by Karl Lear, winner of Best Picture (2013) in New Zealand and Best Picture (2014) in Hawaii. 

In January 2015, they played at [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival]] in Auckland.<ref>http://auckland.lanewayfestival.com/line-up/artist/jakob</ref> They also went on to support [[Royal Blood (band)|Royal Blood]] at the Wellington Laneway sideshow.
