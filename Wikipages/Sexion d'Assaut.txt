'''Sexion d'Assaut''' ({{IPA-fr|sɛksjɔ̃ daso}}), formerly known as '''3ème Prototype''' (for "Troisième Prototype" {{IPA-fr|tʁwɑzjɛm pʁɔtɔtip|}}; {{lang-en|"3rd Prototype"}}), is a [[French hip hop]] band formed in 2002, composed of eight [[Paris|Parisian]] rappers. They are signed to independent record label [[Wati B]], which is under exclusive license to [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Entertainment France]].

The founding members were L.I.O. Pétrodollars, [[Black M]], [[Maska (rapper)|Maska]] and [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]]. In 2003, it became a collective as [[Maître Gims]] and JR O Crom joined in. Throughout its existence, it included about 69 rappers, but set-up changed from time to time. The group distinguishes itself of staying away from "bling bling" that other French rappers have adopted. They also retain the style of old school hip-hop, but keep underground influences and spent almost a decade fostering an underground fanbase before releasing their debut studio album ''[[L'École des points vitaux]]'' in 2010.

Their album ''[[L'École des points vitaux]]'' in 2010 went quadruple platinum. The album ''[[En attendant L'Apogée: les Chroniques du 75]]'' in 2011 and ''[[L'Apogée]]'' in 2012 both went platinum and diamond respectively.

The group is reforming in 2020 with a third album, ''Le Retour des Rois'', and a national tour scheduled for 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexion d’Assaut : le groupe de rap annonce son retour sur scène et une tournée en France en 2021|url=https://www.ouest-france.fr/culture/musiques/sexion-d-assaut-le-groupe-de-rap-annonce-son-retour-sur-scene-et-une-tournee-en-france-en-2021-7082106|url-status=live|website=ouest-france.fr}}</ref>

== Career ==

=== Debut (2002–2004) ===
The Sexion d'Assaut group was formed in 2002 as a collective.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexion d’Assaut :"on est dans nos projets solo" confie Black M|url=http://www.non-stop-people.com/actu/musique/sexion-dassaut-est-dans-nos-projets-solo-confie-black-m-69188|access-date=16 August 2021|website=Non Stop People|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|date=5 March 2012|title=Sexion d'assaut en embuscade rue des Martyrs|language=fr|work=Le Monde.fr|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2012/03/05/sexion-d-assaut-en-embuscade-rue-des-martyrs_1651987_3246.html|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref> It initially had around thirty members from [[Paris]] and its suburbs, then only those most attached to Sexion d'Assaut remained there. The collective is first formed around the group Assonance (L.I.O, [[Barack Adama]], [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]], [[Maska (rapper)|Maska]] and Scrib'R), Prototype 3015 ([[Gims]], JR O Crom and K.A.N.M.S) as well as other groups. Shortly after, solo artists [[Black M]] and [[Doomams]] joined the collective. The internal group 75 Neces'R, composed of Scrib'R, Akeur and Rod'R, released in cassette format the collective's first official project in 2002: an eponymous mixtape, with underground rappers like the group FMR or the rapper [[H Magnum]].

In 2005, the names of the Assonance and Prototype 3015 groups disappeared in favor of the 3rd Prototype. This group included [[Barack Adama]], [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]], [[Maska (rapper)|Maska]], [[Gims]] and JR O Crom. There were also solo artists [[Black M]], [[Doomams]], R-Mak, Balistik, Anraye and L.I.O. (who was abroad at the time), with Jiba Jiba (Amos), Baby Joe (Jonathan Seri) and Dim'One (Khadim Lo) as managers. The first scenes of the group take place on the occasion of [[Fête de la Musique]] or town hall celebrations. It was during the time of Gang Yaba Gang. The young group teamed up to rent hours at the studio, have t-shirts made and, little by little, establish themselves on the Parisian scene.

=== The first projects (2005–2008) ===
The group's meeting with Dawala, founder of the [[Wati B]] label, takes place shortly after in [[Châtelet–Les Halles|Châtelet-Les Halles]], organized by [[H Magnum]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Booska-p|title=Les 12 travaux de la Sexion d'Assaut !|url=https://www.booska-p.com/new-les-12-travaux-de-la-sexion-d-assaut-n21464.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=www.booska-p.com|language=en}}</ref> It was in 2006 that the first project of a member of the collective came out. This is [[Black M]] with its title ''Le Pacte'', a maxi produced in tacit complicity with a close friend, Bakry. This maxi contains eight tracks, the introduction of which, Le Coup finale, features [[Barack Adama]], [[Gims]] and Anraye. If the collaborations with [[Dry (rapper)|Dry]] are numerous, [[Demon One]] is quite distant from the group, with only one participation in the song Interdit en radio, in trio with Dry and  [[Barack Adama]], on the compilation Interdit en ''radio Vol.2''. On 13 May 2006, the first mixtape of the internal group 3e Prototype, ''La Terre du milieu'', was released under the [[Wati B]] label.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexion d'Assaut {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/sexion-dassaut-mn0002142048/biography|access-date=16 August 2021|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> [[Doomams]] participates in the track Freestyle - the same for Black M, which appears twice. R-Mak provides an interlude. Note also an appearance of Anraye.
[[File:Gims.tiff|thumb|[[Gims]] the lead vocalist of the group, in concert with Sexion d'Assaut at [[Cléon]] on 22 February 2010.]]
Balistik, the “phantom” member of the collective, appears once on the title "Ça va ça vient". The song On t'a humilié contributes to the controversy surrounding the group concerning homophobia in September 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Le dérapage homophobe de Sexion d'Assaut|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Sexion-D-Assaut/news-71026.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=www.chartsinfrance.net}}</ref> L.I.O., who went to study in the [[United States]], did not return to the group until 2010 under the name L.I.O. Petrodollars. On 7 December 2006, it was the turn of [[Gims]] to go solo, with an Ep entitled ''[[Pour ceux qui dorment les yeux ouverts]]'', in which Koma from the Scred Connexion participate, on the song of the same name, as well as a collaboration with the full group on the track Permanent "Tsunami permanent". In June 2007, the group released their first music video, "Histoire pire que vraie", followed a few months later by "Anti-tecktonik".

The first street album of the 3rd Prototype, entitled ''Le Renouveau'', was released on 4 April 2008 under the Wati B label, in which we find the two previously clipped tracks, as well as featurings with [[Doomams]] on the title "Fils de lâche", [[Dry (rapper)|Dry]] on Normal, Kizito on Survivor and R-Mak on "Gotham City", without forgetting, as usual, a good number of feats with [[Black M]]. Shortly after, R-Mak left the collective to devote himself to a solo career.

Directly after the release of the street album, the team worked on ''Les Chroniques du mois'', their new songs as well as a freestyle were published every month between July and December 2008. During the month of December, the group released three street clips: "À 30 %", "Où sont les kickeurs?" and "Ah ouais paraît qu'j'suis doué", the third of which contains the clip for the song Even not the SMIC. On 9 January 2009, ''[[Les Chroniques du 75]]'' is published on the Internet, a net-tape which brings together the sounds of the Chroniques du mois, a few tracks from the street album ''Le Renouveau'' and the mix-tape ''La terre du milieu'' and a few unreleased tracks. The goal of this net-tape was to expand their audience, around 3,000 people at the time according to them,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Booska-p|title=Sexion d Assaut Ecrasement de tete de Sexion d Assaut|url=https://www.booska-p.com/video-sexion-d-assaut-ecrasement-de-tete-v646.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=Booska-p|language=en}}</ref> and to promote the next street album.

=== ''L'École des points vitaux'' (2009–2010) ===
The group released their first street album ''[[L'Écrasement de tête]]'' on 4 May 2009. They gained notoriety with the general public thanks to two clips: "T'es bête ou quoi?" and "Wati bon son" in collaboration with [[Dry (rapper)|Dry]]. In order to promote the film [[Ong Bak 2|Ong bak 2]]: Birth of the Dragon, the title "T'es bête ou quoi?" is used for the soundtrack of the film, featuring images from the film. [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]] announces in the Rap Mag of March 2010 the dissolution of the group 3e Prototype since the release of this street album. Consequently, Sexion d'Assaut is no longer a collective, but a group in its own right. This street album allows them to begin their first tour with many dates throughout [[France]], where it is expected in full venues, to their surprise.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Booska-p|title=Sexion d Assaut Documentaire Wati Buzz de Sexion d Assaut|url=https://www.booska-p.com/video-sexion-d-assaut-documentaire-wati-buzz-v643.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=Booska-p|language=en}}</ref>

The group's debut album, ''[[L'École des points vitaux]]'', was released on 29 March 2010,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexion d’Assaut : L’école des points vitaux pour courant 2010 ! - RAPADONF LE BLOG DU RAP FRANCAIS|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/display2.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20100722072827%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Frapadonf.fr%2Fblog%2F2009%2F06%2Fsexion-dassaut-lecole-des-points-vitaux-pour-courant-2010%2F|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=L' École des Points Vitaux - Sexion d'Assaut {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/l%25C3cole-des-points-vitaux-mw0001987099|language=en|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref> by [[Sony Music]]. It is the one in which L.I.O. Pétrodollars participates, on the song "Paname lève-toi". The album was a huge success, and sold over 19,000 copies in the first week.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Team|first=Editorial|date=22 May 2010|title=Sexion d'Assaut - L'école des points vitaux en Belgique !|url=https://www.urbansoul.be/2010/05/22/sexion-dassaut-lecole-des-points-vitaux-en-belgique/|access-date=16 August 2021|website=Urban Soul|language=en-US}}</ref> Titles like "Casquette à l'envers", "L'École des points vitaux" or "Mon gars sûr". The title "Casquette à l'envers" was not released because of [[Nadine Morano]]'s statements, but it could have, as the group confided to Mustapha El Atrassi during a television interview: “We could have made this song after the recent statements by Nadine Morano. The Secretary of State had affirmed: "Me what I want from a young person, when he is French, it is (...) that he does not speak verlan, that he does not put his cap upside down. . It’s a way of saying that clothes don’t make a monk. ”15 The album was certified gold three weeks after its release. The title of the album ''[[L'École des points vitaux]]'' is a nod to the manga [[Fist of the North Star]] (Ken the Survivor in France). We can notice on the last page of the cover of ''L'École des points vitaux'' that [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]] writes on a blank sheet: “Next album: L'APO”. This would indicate a semblance of a title or an acronym for a new album: ''[[L'Apogée]]''. The album ''L'École des points vitaux'' has a total of more than 400,000 copies sold,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexion d'Assaut pour "L'agence tous risques" : le clip !|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Sexion-D-Assaut/news-70162.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=www.chartsinfrance.net}}</ref> and is certified triple platinum.

The titles "Casquette à l'envers", "J'ai pas les loves", "Wati by Night" and the hit "[[Désolé (Sexion d'Assaut song)|Désolé]]''"'' are a huge success with the general public. Change of atmosphere is part of the soundtrack of the film ''[[The A-Team (film)|The A-Team]]''. These pieces are put in the form of clips throughout 2010. Sexion d'Assaut begins a new tour throughout France, notably in the first part of the most famous rap duo in France, [[Suprême NTM]], the 19 June 2010 at the [[Parc des Princes]]. On 6 June in Bercy, they were to open for American rapper [[Jay-Z]], but due to a lack of consideration from their American counterparts, they decided not to open for the concert. They are also the subject of many parodies or other jokes, as in the after-sales service of Omar and Fred's broadcasts on [[Canal+|Canal +]], Willaxxx, or even in a clip by Kevin Razy and the other members of Sexion d'Homos. They are among the first French artists to exceed one million fans (with [[Daft Punk]] and [[David Guetta]]) on the Facebook community site, in August 2010.

=== ''L'Apogée'' (2011–2012) ===
[[File:Maska.jpg|thumb|[[Maska (rapper)|Maska]] member of the groupe here in 2012.|left|318x318px]]On 4 April 2011, the group released a mixtape called ''[[En attendant L'Apogée: les Chroniques du 75]]''. The CD / DVD sells over 150,000 copies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Découvrez le nouveau clip de Sexion D'Assaut : "Avant qu'elle parte"|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Sexion-D-Assaut/news-78348.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=chartsinfrance.net}}</ref> All of the project's tracks have a clip on the DVD, accompanied by an exclusive documentary on the group's journey. On 18 November 2011, Sexion d'Assaut uploaded a freestyle entitled "Welcome to the Wa". In this new video, they announce that the first clip of ''[[L'Apogée]]'' will be called "Mets pas celle-là", which will be released on 11 December 2011 on the official Facebook of Sexion d'Assaut. In this video, [[Barack Adama]] and [[Gims]] also confirm that the album is completely finished.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Booska-p|title=Welcome to the Wa, nouvelle bande-annonce !|url=https://www.booska-p.com/cinema/new-welcome-to-the-wa-nouvelle-bande-annonce-n11438.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=www.booska-p.com|language=en}}</ref> The album was officially released on 5 March 2012. On 20 December 2011, "Welcome to the Wa Part II" was released, and at the end of the freestyle, [[Black M]] announced that the next single from ''L'Apogée'' would be called "Disque d'or", on the group's official Facebook, Friday, 30 December. On Thursday 5 January, live on Skyrock, Sexion d'Assaut exclusively delivers the third extract from ''L'Apogée''. During Planète Rap, the group shares their new single Before she leaves, saying that it is a music different from the others because it is sentimental. This song is probably a tribute to JR O Crom's mother who, according to the lyrics, left too soon.

''L'Apogée'' was published on 5 March 2012. On the very day of the release, 10,000 copies sold. The album is certified gold the first week after having sold 66,000 copies. Two weeks after the release, the album is certified platinum disc. About two months after its release the album was declared a double platinum disc. On 22 May 2012, they filled the Salle de Bercy for the first time. The CD / DVD of this concert is due out on 19 November 2012. The second Bercy de Sexion d'Assaut took place on 15 October 2012. At the end of the concert, [[Maska (rapper)|Maska]] announces that the reissue of ''L'Apogée'' will be available in stores at from January 2013. On 22 October 2012, the album ''L'Apogée'' was certified diamond disc with more than 539,000 copies sold.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Squat|date=8 January 2013|title=Sexion D'Assaut : L'Apogée 3ème album le plus vendu en France|url=https://www.13or-du-hiphop.fr/2013/01/09/sexion-dassaut-lapogee-3eme-album-le-plus-vendu-en-france/|access-date=16 August 2021|website=13OR-du-HipHop|language=fr-FR}}</ref> The album was reissued on 19 November at the same time as the DVD of the Bercy concert.

=== Consecration (2013–2019) ===
After the immense success of ''[[L'Apogée]]'', Sexion d'Assaut won two [[NRJ Music Award|NRJ Music Awards]] on 26 January 2013 in the categories of “Francophone group / duo of the year” and “Francophone song of the year” for "Avant qu'elle parte".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sexion d'Assaut triomphe aux NRJ Music Awards : les rappeurs ont appris de leurs erreurs - le Plus|url=https://leplus.nouvelobs.com/contribution/769920-sexion-d-assaut-triomphe-aux-nrj-music-awards-les-rappeurs-ont-appris-de-leurs-erreurs.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=leplus.nouvelobs.com|language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=PSY et Sexion d'Assaut dominent les NRJ Music Awards|url=https://www.lefigaro.fr/musique/2013/01/27/03006-20130127ARTFIG00085-psy-et-sexion-d-assaut-dominent-nrj-music-awards.php|access-date=16 August 2021|website=LEFIGARO|language=fr}}</ref> Two days later, the video ''Welcome to the WA Part was released. 4'' with a documentary retracing the NRJ Music Awards of Sexion d'Assaut.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Squat|date=28 January 2013|title=Sexion d'Assaut - Welcome to the WA Part. 4 : La Consécration|url=https://www.13or-du-hiphop.fr/2013/01/29/sexion-dassaut-welcome-to-the-wa-part-4-la-consecration/|access-date=16 August 2021|website=13OR-du-HipHop|language=fr-FR}}</ref> In early 2013, rumors circulated about a possible separation of Sexion d'Assaut. To these rumors, [[Black M]] replies: "But who told you 'the Sexion is separating'?

On 31 January 2013, the specialized website ''Booska-P'' produced a documentary entitled ''Wati Ceremony'', on Sexion d'Assaut's triumph at the NRJ Music Awards.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Booska-p|title=Sexion d'Assaut, Shin Sekai, Ca bouge chez Wati-b !|language=en|url=http://www.booska-p.com/new-sexion-d-assaut-shin-sekai-ca-bouge-chez-wati-b-n12340.html|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref>

In the video, Gims announces in C'Cauet that his solo album ''[[Subliminal (album)|Subliminal]]'' will be released on 20 May 2013 and that this album will be followed by [[Black M]]'s solo album scheduled for late 2013, that of [[Maska (rapper)|Maska]] scheduled for 2014, a project between [[Doomams]] and JR O Crom planned for the course of 2014. In March 2013, JR O Chrome and [[Doomams]] participate in the soundtrack of the film ''La Cité rose'', with the title If I had known, in collaboration with Jmi Sissoko and Exta; also released a book which traces the life of [[Gims]] and a comic strip.

On 28 September 2013, the group met at the Stade de France for the Urban Peace 3 concert which also brought together [[IAM (band)|IAM]], [[Orelsan]], [[Youssoupha]], [[La Fouine]], [[Psy 4 de la Rime]] and [[Stromae]]. Gims also performed solo on this occasion. In December 2013, Gims was once again nominated for the [[NRJ Music Award|NRJ Music Awards]], but this time solo, in the “best male artist” category. However, it is [[Stromae]] who wins this trophy.

=== ''Le Retour des Rois'' (since 2020) ===
After one or more solo albums, the group would like to come back with a new album, entitled ''Le Retour des Rois''. However, due to different agendas for each member of the group, the production of the album is constantly postponed. The members of the group did not go their separate ways. When a member of the group leaves a solo project, all the members of Sexion d'Assaut help him in his project. In addition, in various interviews the members say they are ready and motivated for the project. While [[Gims]] wishes to conquer the American market with his third album ''[[Ceinture noire]]'' released on 23 March 2018,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Booska-p|title=Maître Gims se tourne vers les Etats-Unis !|url=https://www.booska-p.com/new-maitre-gims-se-tourne-vers-les-etats-unis-n64142.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=www.booska-p.com|language=en}}</ref> [[Black M]] is on tour throughout [[France]] and releases the reissue of his album ''[[Éternel insatisfait]],'' on 17 November 2017, [[Barack Adama]] is working on his first Extended play ''Libertad'' on 21 February 2017, [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]] released his second album ''Visionnaire'' on 22 September 2017, [[Maska (rapper)|Maska]] his new mixtape ''Akhal-Teké'' on 13 October 2017 and LIO Pétrodollars a return to his first Extended play ''Outre monde'' on 19 October 2017. JR O Crom and [[Doomams]] are also working on their respective solo projects. It is therefore currently becoming complicated to bring together all the members in the same studio.<ref>{{Citation|title=Lefa : « La Sexion commence à tous nous manquer... »|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA23hfNsndo|language=en|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref>

The return to the studio of the members of the group was to take place in March 2017 as announced by Dawala, the boss of the [[Wati B]] label. However, in February 2017, due to a copyright issue, [[Gims]] decided to leave the [[Wati B]] Label, which at the same time clouded the possibility of a return of the group, being himself signed with Wati B<ref>{{Cite web|last=Generations|date=9 February 2017|title=Generations|url=https://generations.fr/news/coulisse/39299/maitre-gims-en-procs-contre-dawala|access-date=16 August 2021|website=Generations|language=fr-FR}}</ref> its collaborations of the third album of the Sexion d'Assaut. No information on the group filtered until an interview with [[Black M]] granted to Mouv '(August 2017), during which he revealed the following information: "We are going to go on tour again, surely the Zéniths of all France as d 'habit ".<ref>{{Cite web|title=L'apprenti : Willaxxx et Yasmine partent à la rencontre de Black M et Tonio Life [vidéo]|url=https://www.mouv.fr/humour/l-apprenti-willaxxx-et-yasmine-partent-a-la-rencontre-de-black-m-et-tonio-life-video-303520|access-date=16 August 2021|website=Mouv|language=fr}}</ref> It is then the turn of [[Gims]], during an interview for the concert of tolerance in [[Agadir]] in October 2017, to reveal more information on the return of the group: “My third album is called ''[[Ceinture noire]]'', it will be released. next year. And the return of Sexion d'Assaut will be just after my next album ”,“ We talk about it a lot between us. After that, we do not communicate on it yet, because there are a lot of schedules which are quite complicated to articulate together.

== Controversies ==

=== Homophobia ===
In June 2010, during an official interview in the magazine International Hip-Hop,<ref>[http://musique.jeuxactu.com/news-sexion-d-assaut-est-il-un-groupe-homophobe-3774.htm JeuxActu MusiqueMag: Sexion d'Assaut est-il un groupe homophobe?] (in French)</ref> [[Lefa (rapper)|Lefa]] (a member of the group) said: “For a while, we attacked homosexuals a lot because we are one hundred percent homophobic and that 'we assume it ”as well as“ for us, the fact of being homosexual is a deviance which is not tolerable ”and that“ homosexuality is far from our practices. We don't understand it. We come from an environment where there is none ”. Two of the group's songs contain the following lyrics: "I think it is high time that queers perish, cut off their penises, leave the dead, found on the ring road (in the song "On t'a humilié" Gone are the days when homosexuals made up themselves in scred All these practices are not healthy (in the song "Cessez le feu")."<ref>[http://www.peoplenews.biz/article-sexion-d-assaut-nrj-lace-le-groupe-57944846.html PeopleNews: Sexion d'assaut - NRJ lâche le groupe] (in French)</ref>

Following these statements, [[Fun Radio (France)|Fun Radio]] and [[NRJ]] banned Sexion d'Assaut from aerial and calls for concert cancellations were made.<ref>{{Cite news|date=4 October 2010|title=Homophobie : un élu demande l'annulation du concert de Sexion d'assaut à Paris|language=fr|work=Le Monde.fr|url=https://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/10/04/homophobie-un-elu-demande-l-annulation-du-concert-de-sexion-d-assaut-a-paris_1420235_823448.html|access-date=16 August 2021}}</ref> The group then released a statement saying that "Sexion d'Assaut would like to apologize to those who have been hurt or shocked." The [[SOS Homophobie]] association demands that Sexion d'Assaut cannot participate in the [[MTV Europe Music Awards]] on 7 November 2010 in [[Madrid]],<ref>[http://www.jeanmarcmorandini.com/article-45001-mtv-retire-sexion-d-assaut-de-ses-europe-music-awards.html MTV retire Sexion d'Assaut de ses Europe Music Awards] (in French)</ref> claiming that: "Sexion d'Assaut is not worthy of representing [[France]]". On 12 October 2011,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Match|first=Paris|title=Sexion d’assaut, les doux agneaux du rap|url=https://www.parismatch.com/Culture/Musique/Sexion-d-assaut-les-doux-agneaux-du-rap-158244|access-date=16 August 2021|website=parismatch.com|language=fr}}</ref> an agreement was signed with the [[LGBT community centre]], acknowledging the fulfillment of the group's commitments, and which considers the controversy to be over.<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 October 2011|title=Sexion d'Assaut définitivement contre l'homophobie|url=https://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/sexion-d-assaut-definitivement-contre-l-homophobie_1042511.html|access-date=16 August 2021|website=LExpress.fr|language=fr}}</ref> Questioned by the group, the journalist who reported the comments in Hip Hop magazine saw her professional reputation destroyed and lost her business.

=== Group name ===
When choosing the name, the protagonists seemed to be totally unaware of the historical existence of the Assault Section (SA; [[Sturmabteilung]] in German),<ref>[http://www.ozap.com/actu/mamadou-balde-tribunal-violences-compagne/370694 Ozap.com: Sexion d'Assaut - Après les propos homophobes, un des leaders jugé pour violences conjugales] (in French)</ref> a paramilitary branch of the Nazi Party, so the name of the group does not refer to it, the members specifying moreover that "the assault sections exist in all the armies".
