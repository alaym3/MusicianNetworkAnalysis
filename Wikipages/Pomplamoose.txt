'''Pomplamoose''' is an American musical duo composed of husband-and-wife multi-instrumentalist [[Jack Conte]] and singer-songwriter and bassist [[Nataly Dawn]]. The duo formed in 2008<ref name="brock">{{cite web|last=Potstra|first=Alison|date=November 4, 2008|title=Pomplamoose: your new favourite band|url=http://media.www.brockpress.com/media/storage/paper384/news/2008/11/04/ArtsEntertainment/Pomplamoose.Your.New.Favourite.Band-3523536.shtml|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211200243/http://media.www.brockpress.com/media/storage/paper384/news/2008/11/04/ArtsEntertainment/Pomplamoose.Your.New.Favourite.Band-3523536.shtml|archive-date=February 11, 2009|access-date=August 25, 2009|website=The Brock Press}}</ref> and sold approximately 100,000 songs online in 2009.<ref name=npr/> They are known for their viral YouTube videos and covers of popular songs.<ref>{{cite web|last=XOXO Festival|date=October 17, 2013|title=Jack Conte, Pomplamoose/Patreon – XOXO Festival (2013)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9NjntTUJ1Q|access-date=August 4, 2020|website=YouTube}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name of the band derives from a misspelling of the French word ''[[:fr:Pamplemousse et pomélo|pamplemousse]]'', meaning [[grapefruit]].<ref name="dailydot" />

==History==
[[File:Pomplamoose.jpg|thumb|Pomplamoose performing in 2011]]
Pomplamoose's presence is primarily from videos on YouTube,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Keen|first=Andrew|date=February 17, 2020|title=Keen On… Pomplamoose: How Nataly And Jack Are Reinventing The Music Business (TCTV)|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/02/17/keen-on-pomplamoose-how-nataly-and-jack-are-reinventing-the-music-business-tctv/|access-date=August 2, 2020|website=[[TechCrunch]]}}</ref> with few live performances. They have gathered over 1.2&nbsp;million subscribers and over 200 million viewers on their YouTube channel as of December 2020.<ref name="youtube-stats">{{cite web|title=PomplamooseMusic|url=https://www.youtube.com/c/PomplamooseMusic/about|access-date=August 2, 2020|website=YouTube}}</ref> Their first song "Hail Mary" was featured on the front page of YouTube.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 1, 2012|title=Nataly Dawn Releases Debut Album|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Nataly-Dawn-Releases-Debut-Album-20121101|access-date=August 4, 2020|website=[[BroadwayWorld]]}}</ref>

Their videos mostly take the form of "VideoSongs", a medium Conte defines with two rules:<ref name="gearwire22">{{cite web|date=June 24, 2009|title=Electro-Harmonix Bass MicroSynth Makes Some Amazing Low End For Jack Conte of Pomplamoose|url=http://www.gearwire.com/electroharmonix-bassmicrosynth-reviewjackconte.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123231024/http://www.gearwire.com/electroharmonix-bassmicrosynth-reviewjackconte.html|archive-date=November 23, 2012|access-date=March 2, 2014|publisher=Gearwire}}</ref>
#What you see is what you hear. (No [[lip sync|lip-syncing]] for instruments or voice)
#If you hear it, at some point you see it. (No hidden sounds)

On April 11, 2010, the band was interviewed on [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Things Considered]]''.<ref name="npr" /> Conte discussed the "glitz-free" manner in which they record:
{{quote|I guess I kinda don't like how there's such a pedestal for music culture and especially for band culture, it just feels fake; it feels like smoke and mirrors. I feel like music doesn't have to be like that. It can be something that's very normal and very accessible.}}

Also in April 2010, their cover of [[The Chordettes]]' "[[Mr. Sandman]]" was used in a commercial for [[Toyota]]'s [[Toyota Avalon|Avalon]] series, set in an [[Art Deco]] train station.<ref name="npr">{{cite web|date=April 9, 2010|title=Pomplamoose: Making A Living On YouTube|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125783271|access-date=August 2, 2020|work=[[NPR]]|series=All Things Considered}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Toyota|date=February 14, 2011|title=Toyota Avalon Train TV commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubtVZQfQHiM|access-date=September 19, 2016|work=YouTube}}</ref>

In September 2010, Pomplamoose recorded a song in collaboration with [[Allee Willis]], "Jungle Animal". Willis contacted the duo after hearing their cover of "[[September (Earth, Wind & Fire song)|September]]" by [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] and offered to write a new song for them. Willis also provided the single art for the song.<ref>

During the Christmas season of 2010, Pomplamoose performed in several ads in the style of their YouTube videos for [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]], singing their versions of Christmas classics such as "[[O Come, All Ye Faithful]]", "[[Jingle Bells]]", "[[Up on the Housetop]]", and "[[Deck the Halls]]".<ref name="sfweekly">{{cite web|author=Port|first=Ian S.|date=November 23, 2010|title=Pomplamoose Turns Its Talents on for Hyundai Commercials|url=https://archives.sfweekly.com/shookdown/2010/11/23/pomplamoose-turns-its-talents-on-for-hyundai-commercials|access-date=November 24, 2010|work=[[SF Weekly]]}}</ref>

In 2011, Pomplamoose began a webcast named ''Hey, It's Pomplamoose: A Show about Pomplamoose and Other Things''.<ref name="dailydot">{{Cite web|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|date=June 21, 2017|title=Pomplamoose’s Nataly Dawn is ready for her close-up|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/nataly-dawn/|access-date=August 2, 2020|website=[[The Daily Dot]]}}</ref> On November 5, 2013, Pomplamoose launched the second season of the webcast: a three-part sequel to the band’s early years, including but not limited to, videos, a tour, and an album (released on July 29, 2014).{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

Conte and Dawn married in late 2016.<ref name="dailydot" />

On May 18, 2021, Dawn announced her diagnosis with [[basal-cell carcinoma]] and that due to her condition, Pomplamoose would be releasing fewer videos per month.<ref name="personalupdate">{{Cite web|date=May 18, 2021|title=Personal update|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qjfx7NfG4Y|website=YouTube|publisher=Pomplamoose|accessdate=May 20, 2021}}</ref>

==Philanthropy==
In November 2010, Pomplamoose created a book drive for a charter school in [[Richmond, California]], offering a free download of an album to anyone who purchased a book for the school district.
