==Biography==
Floyd was born in [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]], Alabama, and grew up in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].<ref name="AMG"/> He founded [[The Falcons]], which also featured [[Mack Rice]].<ref name="AMG"/> They were forerunners to future Detroit vocal groups such as [[The Temptations]] and [[The Four Tops]]. Their most successful songs included "You're So Fine" and later, when [[Wilson Pickett]] was recruited into the group as the lead singer, "I Found a Love".<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=88}}</ref> Pickett then embarked on a solo career, and The Falcons disbanded.<ref name="AMG"/>

Floyd signed a contract with the [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]-based [[Stax Records]] as a songwriter in 1965.<ref name="AMG"/> He wrote a [[hit record|hit song]], "Comfort Me", recorded by [[Carla Thomas]]. He then teamed with Stax's guitarist [[Steve Cropper]] to write songs for Wilson Pickett, now signed to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Atlantic distributed Stax and [[Jerry Wexler]] brought Pickett from New York City to work with [[Booker T. & the MGs]]. The Pickett sessions were successful, yielding several pop and R&B hits, including the Floyd co-written "Ninety-Nine and a Half (Won't Do)" and "[[634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)]]".<ref name="AMG"/>

In 1966, Floyd recorded a song initially written for [[Otis Redding]]. Wexler convinced Stax president [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]] to release Floyd's version. The Steve Cropper-Eddie Floyd "[[Knock on Wood (Eddie Floyd song)|Knock on Wood]]" launched Floyd's solo career,<ref name="AMG"/> and has been [[cover version|covered]] by over a hundred different artists from [[David Bowie]] to [[Count Basie]]. Eventually, Redding would cut an R&B hit version of the song in 1967 as a duet with [[Carla Thomas]]. It became a [[disco]] hit for [[Amii Stewart]] in 1979.<ref>[https://www.allmusic.com/artist/amii-stewart-mn0000019873 Amii Stewart] All music, retrieved 11 November 2021</ref>

Floyd was one of Stax's most consistent and versatile artists. He scored several more hits on his own, including "I've Never Found a Girl (To Love Me Like You Do)" and "[[Raise Your Hand]]",<ref name="AMG"/> which was covered by both [[Janis Joplin]] and [[Bruce Springsteen]].

The song "Big Bird"<ref name="LarkinSM"/> (featuring [[Booker T. Jones]] on organ and guitar, [[Al Jackson, Jr.]] on drums, and [[Donald "Duck" Dunn]] on bass) was written while Floyd waited in a London airport for a plane back to the United States for Otis Redding's funeral. 

Floyd's career did not keep him from being one of the label's most productive writers. Almost every Stax artist recorded Floyd material, often co-written with either Cropper or Jones, including [[Sam & Dave]] ("You Don't Know What You Mean to Me"), [[Rufus Thomas]] ("The Breakdown"), Otis Redding ("I Love You More Than Words Can Say"), and [[Johnnie Taylor]]'s "Just the One (I've Been Looking For)". The latter played during the opening credits of director [[Harold Ramis]]'s film ''[[Bedazzled (2000 film)|Bedazzled]]''.

In 1980, Floyd released material on the UK record label I-Spy Records, owned and created by the UK band [[Secret Affair]].<ref name="AMG"/> He joined old Stax collaborators Cropper and Dunn, and fronted [[The Blues Brothers Band]] on a series of world tours, and in 1998, Floyd and former Falcon Wilson Pickett appeared on screen dueting on "634-5789" in ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]''.<ref name="AMG"/>

As well as singing with The Blues Brothers Band, Floyd has been the special guest with former [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stone]] [[Bill Wyman]]'s [[Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings|Rhythm Kings]] on several dates in the US and the UK.

In 2008, Floyd returned to Stax Records, which was owned by [[Concord Music Group]] since 2004. His first new album in six years, ''Eddie Loves You So'', was released in July 2008.<ref name="AMG"/><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20161220093636/http://stax50.com/blog/news/eddie-floyd-readies-new-stax-album-of-southern-soul-music/] {{dead link|date=June 2021}}</ref>

In November 2012, Floyd was inducted into the Carolina Beach Music Hall of Fame as a Pioneer Award Recipient.

In December 2012, Floyd released a new album at Christmas time. Eddie also has a son, Anthony Floyd, who also sings with him. In 2016 he was inducted into the National Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame. 

Eddie Floyd was named to the [[Memphis Music Hall of Fame]] in 2018<ref> [https://www.memphisflyer.com/memphis-music-hall-of-fame-announces-2018-inductees Memphis Music Hall of Fame] Retrieved 11 November 2021</ref>

On 1 September 2017, age 80, Floyd performed live at the Royal Albert Hall BBC Proms with Jools Holland and his Rhythm & Blues Orchestra, in a tribute concert to 50 years of Stax Records synonymous with Southern soul music.

On February 28, 2020, Rock House Records released Eddie Floyd's 1979 recording "Guess It Wasn't Meant To Be".
