==History==

===Formation (1999–2000)===
Grant and Siljamäki met at the [[University of Westminster]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clubglow.com/djs/9-things-you-didnt-know-about-above-and-beyond/|title=9 Things You Didn't Know About Above and Beyond|website=Club Glow Washington, D.C.|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> Having discovered a common mutual interest for electronic music, they decided to collaborate in writing music together.<ref>{{cite web|title=Above & Beyond Bio, News, Music & Shows|url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/above-and-beyond/|publisher=DJZ.com|access-date=6 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329123259/http://djz.com/featured_djs/above-and-beyond/|archive-date=29 March 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Following Siljamäki's suggestion, they set up the Anjunabeats label in the summer of 1999 with the release of their first single, "Volume One", under the alias Anjunabeats.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/young-star/73515/anjunabeats-bringing-trance-back|title=Anjunabeats: Bringing trance back|website=philstar.com|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> Initially, the Anjunabeats record label was founded as a medium to release their own music. Since the label acquired the same name as their production alias, however, they started to release music under different names, most notably as Dirt Devils and Free State.

The original mix of "Volume One", packaged with their Tease Dub Mix, received immediate attention in various dance clubs and quickly gained support from DJs such as [[Pete Tong]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Judge Jules]], and [[Paul van Dyk]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skiddle.com/news/all/DJ-Love-Above--Beyond/26966/|title=DJ Love: Above & Beyond|website=Skiddle.com|language=en-gb|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> after Grant and Paavo Siljamäki personally handed a [[dub plate]] of the song to [[Paul Oakenfold]] in 2000 at Home, the now-defunct London nightclub.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.beatport.com/en/above-beyond-and-the-state-of-trance-in-2009/|title=Above & Beyond and the state of trance|date=7 October 2009|website=Beatport News (EN)|language=en-US|access-date=13 June 2016}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Following the success of "Volume One" and a string of singles and remixes under their Free State and Dirt Devils alter egos, the marketing director & manager of Warner Music Group, [[Tony McGuinness (English musician)|Tony McGuinness]], was alerted to the duo by his brother, Liam McGuinness.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.beatfactor.net/features/627/above-&-beyond,-trance-music-versus-eclectic-sound.html|title=Beatfactor: Above & Beyond, trance music versus eclectic sound|website=Beatfactor|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> Liam had purchased a sample library that Grant had created for Yamaha and got in touch with Jono.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.timespace.com/features/2053/above-%2526-beyond-on-global-success,-production-toys-and-spectrasonics-omnisphere.html|title=Above & Beyond on global success, production toys and Spectrasonics Omnisphere – Features – Time+Space {{!}} Virtual Instruments, VST Plug-ins, Effects Plug-ins and Samples for Music Production|website=www.timespace.com|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> Having been commissioned to remix [[Chakra (band, electronic)|Chakra]]'s "Home", Tony McGuinness recruited Grant and Siljamäki to help him complete the remix.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.harderfaster.net/text/features/10694|title=Above & Beyond Interview from 2004|access-date=24 July 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719094159/http://www.harderfaster.net/text/features/10694|archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref> When the group was searching for a name to use for their Chakra remix, the inspiration came from a web page belonging to an American motivational trainer coincidentally named Jono Grant. Grant had the poster stuck to his wall. The slogan used by the motivational trainer was "Above & Beyond", and they decided to use that as their name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ministryofsound.com/magazine/2015/08/13/dj-names-where-did-they-come-from|title=Cool Story Bro: The Origin of Your Favourite Artists' DJ Names {{!}} Magazine {{!}} Ministry of Sound|website=www.ministryofsound.com|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> Although the group was relatively unknown at the time, their remix of Chakra's "Home" was picked over remixes by Rob Searle and [[Tilt (producers)|Tilt]] to be the A-side mix, and, after plays by Pete Tong on [[BBC Radio 1]], it reached number one in the UK club charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.djmag.com/news/royal-acoustics-above-beyond|title=THE ROYAL ACOUSTICS OF ABOVE & BEYOND|website=DJMag.com|date=8 June 2016|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref>

In addition to Above & Beyond's production work, the trio also established the vocal trance group [[OceanLab]] with [[Justine Suissa]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trance.news/justine-suissa-above-beyond-acoustic/|title=Justine Suissa to be part of Above & Beyond's Acoustic tour|date=26 April 2016|website=Trance Hub|language=en-US|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref>

Other collaborators in the band's early stages include [[Andy Moor (musician)|Andy Moor]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.beatport.com/track/air-for-life-original-mix/49726|title=Air For Life (Original Mix) by Andy Moor, Above & Beyond on Beatport|website=www.beatport.com|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> and vocalists Carrie Skipper, Ashley Tomberlin, [[Zoë Johnston]], and [[Richard Bedford]].

Interest in Above & Beyond soon emerged from established trance labels and new remixes were requested: the trio remixed [[Aurora (electronic music group)|Aurora]]'s "Ordinary World", [[Fragma]]'s "Everytime You Need Me", [[Armin van Buuren|Perpetuous Dreamer's]] "The Sound of Goodbye", and [[Adamski]]'s "In the City".

Above & Beyond's single "No One On Earth", featuring the vocals of [[Zoë Johnston]], soon followed. The [[Gabriel & Dresden]] Remix of this song was voted Tune of the Year for 2004 in [[Armin van Buuren]]'s trance radio show ''[[A State of Trance]]''.<ref name="episode-181">{{cite web|url=http://www.astateoftrance.com/episodes/episode-181/|title=A State of Trance Episode 181 (Top 20 of 2004) Tracklist|access-date=16 December 2009}}</ref>

{{Quote|text="The acoustic project is a reconnection with the musicians that we were before we met ... the songs have been on an interesting journey to get here because we tend to write in a fairly acoustic way anyway. We don't just stick a bit of vocal over a dance track – that's not how we work. We try to start with a song and it's usually only later down the line that we take certain elements from that song and progress them into a more dancefloor-friendly version."<ref>{{cite news |title=Above & Beyond Acoustic OUT NOW!! |publisher=Above & Beyond |year=2014 |url=http://www.aboveandbeyond.nu/news/above-beyond-acoustic-out-now|access-date=28 January 2014}}</ref>|sign=Tony McGuinness}}
