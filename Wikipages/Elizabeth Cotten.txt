'''Elizabeth "Libba" Cotten''' (née '''Nevills''') (January 5, 1893 – June 29, 1987)<ref name="bare">{{cite book| first1= Bob| last1= Eagle| first2= Eric S.| last2= LeBlanc| year= 2013| title= Blues: A Regional Experience| publisher= Praeger | location= Santa Barbara, California| page=278 | isbn= 978-0313344237}}</ref> was an American blues and folk musician, singer, and songwriter.

A self-taught left-handed guitarist, Cotten developed her own original style. She played a guitar strung for a right-handed player, but played it upside down, as she was left-handed.<ref>{{Cite journal|year=2009|title=Cotten Elizabeth 'Libba'|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.001.0001/acref-9780195313734-e-36858|journal=Encyclopedia of Popular Music (4th Ed.)|isbn=978-0-19-531373-4|language=en}}</ref> This position meant that she would play the bass lines with her fingers and the melody with her thumb. Her signature [[alternating bass]] style has become known as "Cotten picking".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zollo|first=Rick|year=2006|title=Cotten Picking: Elizabeth Cotten and the Folk Revival|journal=Shenandoah|volume= 56| issue = 2|pages=67–75}}</ref>

==Early life==
Cotten was born in 1893<ref name="U.S. Federal Census 1870">U.S. Federal Census, Chapel Hill. 1870, 1880, 1900.</ref> to a musical family near [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]],<ref name="U.S. Federal Census 1870"/> in an area that would later be incorporated as [[Carrboro, North Carolina|Carrboro]]. Her parents were George Nevill (also spelled Nevills) and Louisa (or Louise) Price Nevill. Elizabeth was the youngest of five children. She named herself on her first day of school, when the teacher asked her name, because at home she was only called "Li'l Sis."<ref name="I Dream a World">{{cite book |editor-last=Summers |editor-first=Barbara |editor-link=Barbara Summers |date=1989 |title=I Dream a World: Portraits of Black Women Who Changed America |publisher=Stewart, Tabori, & Chang |others=photographs and interviews by [[Brian Lanker]] |location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/idreamworldportr00lank/page/156 156] |isbn=155670092X |oclc=18745605 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/idreamworldportr00lank/page/156 }}</ref> By the age of 8, she was playing songs. At age 9, she was forced to quit school and began work as a [[Domestic worker|domestic]].<ref name="Govenar">{{cite book| editor-last=Govenar |editor-first=Alan |year=2001 |chapter=Elizabeth Cotten: African American Songster and Songwriter |title=Masters of Traditional Arts: A Biographical Dictionary |volume=vol. 1 (A-J)|location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-Clio |pages=144–146|isbn=1576072401|oclc=47644303}}</ref> At the age of 12, she had a live-in job at Chapel Hill. She earned a dollar a month, that her mother saved up to buy her first [[guitar]].<ref name=bailey>{{Cite book|title = The Remarkable Lives of 100 Women Artists|last = Bailey|first = Brooke|publisher = Bob Adams|year = 1994|isbn = 1-55850-360-9|pages = [https://archive.org/details/remarkableliveso0000bail/page/32 32]|url = https://archive.org/details/remarkableliveso0000bail/page/32}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Elizabeth Cotten – Masters of Traditional Arts|url=http://mastersoftraditionalarts.org/artists/72|access-date=2020-10-06|website=mastersoftraditionalarts.org}}</ref> The guitar, a [[Sears and Roebuck]] brand instrument, cost $3.75 ({{inflation|US|3.75|1904|fmt=eq}}).<ref name=bailey/> Although self-taught, she became proficient at playing the instrument,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eclectica.org/v1n1/nonfiction/demerlee.html|title=Remembering Elizabeth Cotten |access-date=April 7, 2008 |author=Demerle', L. L. |year=1996}}</ref> and her repertoire included a large number of [[Ragtime|rags]] and dance tunes.<ref name="Govenar"/>

By her early teens, she was writing her own songs, one of which, "[[Freight Train (folk song)|Freight Train]]", became one of her most recognized. She wrote the song in remembrance of a nearby train that she could hear from her childhood home.<ref name="Govenar"/> The 1956 [[United Kingdom|UK]] recording of the song by [[Chas McDevitt]] and [[Nancy Whiskey]] was a major hit and is credited as one of the main influences on the rise of [[skiffle]] in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chasmcdevitt.com/Skiffle.htm |title=RIDIN' THE FREIGHT TRAIN WITH CHAS McDEVITT (Archived copy) |access-date=April 9, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130524021114/http://www.chasmcdevitt.com/Skiffle.htm |archive-date=May 24, 2013 }} Chas McDevitt: Skiffle</ref>

Around the age of 13, Cotten began working as a maid along with her mother. On November 7, 1910, at the age of 17, she married Frank Cotten.<ref>Orange County Register of Deeds Office, Marriage License Book 10, p. 268.</ref> The couple had a daughter, Lillie, and soon after Elizabeth gave up guitar playing for family and [[Christian Church|church]].
Elizabeth, Frank and their daughter Lillie moved around the eastern [[United States]] for a number of years, between [[North Carolina]], New York City, and Washington, D.C., finally settling in the D.C. area. When Lillie married, Elizabeth divorced Frank and moved in with her daughter and her family.

==Rediscovery==
Cotten retired from playing the guitar for 25 years, except for occasional church performances. She did not begin performing publicly and recording until she was in her 60s. She was discovered by the folk-singing Seeger family while she was working for them as a housekeeper.

While working briefly in a department store, Cotten helped a child wandering through the aisles find her mother. The child was [[Peggy Seeger]], and the mother was the composer [[Ruth Crawford Seeger]]. Soon after this, Cotten again began working as a maid, this time for Ruth Crawford Seeger and [[Charles Seeger]], and caring for their children, [[Mike Seeger|Mike]], Peggy, Barbara, and Penny. While working with the Seegers (a voraciously musical family that included [[Pete Seeger]], a son of Charles from a previous marriage), she remembered her own guitar playing from 40 years prior and picked up the instrument again and relearned to play it, almost from scratch.<ref name=bailey/>

==Later career and recordings==
In the later half of the 1950s, [[Mike Seeger]] began making bedroom [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] recordings of Cotten's songs in her house.<ref name="mike seeger">Mike Seeger Collection Inventory (#20009), Southern Folklife Collection, Wilson Library, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.</ref> These recordings later became the album ''[[Folksongs and Instrumentals with Guitar]]'', which was released by [[Folkways Records]]. Since the release of that album, her songs, especially her signature song, "Freight Train" — which she wrote when she was a teenager — have been covered by [[Peter, Paul, and Mary]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Joe Dassin]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Laura Gibson]], [[Laura Veirs]], [[His Name Is Alive]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], [[Geoff Farina]], and [[Country Teasers]].

[[Peggy Seeger]] took the song "Freight Train" with her to England, where it became popular in folk music circles. British songwriters Paul James and Fred Williams subsequently misappropriated it as their own composition and copyrighted it.  Under their credit, it was then recorded by British skiffle singer [[Chas McDevitt]], who recorded the song in December, 1956.  Under advice from his manager (Bill Varley), McDevitt then brought in folk-singer [[Nancy Whiskey]] and re-recorded the song with her doing the vocal; the result was a chart hit. McDevitt's version influenced many young skiffle groups of the day, including [[The Quarrymen]]. Under the advocacy of the influential Seeger family, the copyright was eventually restored to Cotten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biography.yourdictionary.com/elizabeth-cotten |accessdate=2017-07-17 |title="Elisabeth Cotten"|website=Biography.yourdictionary.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/chas-mcdevitt-mn0000083674 |accessdate=2017-07-17 |title="Chas McDevitt"|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>  Nevertheless, it remains mis-credited in many sources.

Shortly after that first album, she began playing concerts with Mike Seeger, the first of which was in 1960 at [[Swarthmore College]].

In the early 1960s, Cotten went on to play concerts with some of the big names in the burgeoning [[American folk music revival|folk revival]]. Some of these included [[Mississippi John Hurt]], [[John Lee Hooker]], and [[Muddy Waters]] at venues such as the [[Newport Folk Festival]] and the [[Smithsonian Folklife Festival|Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife]].

The newfound interest in her work inspired her to write more songs to perform, and in 1967 she released a record created with her grandchildren, which took its name from one of her songs, "Shake Sugaree". The song featured 12-year-old Brenda Joyce Evans, Cotten's great-grandchild, and future [[Undisputed Truth]] singer.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Using profits from her touring, record releases and awards given to her for her own contributions to the folk arts, Cotten was able to move with her daughter and grandchildren from Washington, D.C., and buy a house in [[Syracuse, New York]]. She was also able to continue touring and releasing records well into her 80s. In 1984, she won the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Ethnic or Traditional Recording, for the album ''Elizabeth Cotten Live'', released by [[Arhoolie Records]]. When accepting the award in Los Angeles, her comment was, "Thank you. I only wish I had my guitar so I could play a song for you all." In 1989, Cotten was one of 75 influential African-American women included in the photo documentary ''[[I Dream a World]].''{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Cotten died in June 1987, at Crouse-Irving Hospital in Syracuse, New York, at the age of 94.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/obituaries/elizabeth-libba-cotten-95-a-blues-and-folk-songwriter.html|title=Elizabeth (Libba) Cotten, 95, a Blues and Folk Songwriter|date=June 30, 1987|newspaper=New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref>

==Guitar style==
Cotten began writing music while toying with her older brother's [[banjo]]. She was [[Handedness|left-handed]], so she played the banjo in reverse position. Later, when she transferred her songs to the guitar, she formed a unique style, since on a 5-string banjo the uppermost string is not a bass string, but a short, high-pitched string which ends at the fifth fret. This required her to adopt a unique style for the guitar. She first played with the "all finger down strokes" like a banjo.<ref name=bailey/> Later, her playing evolved into a unique style of [[fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]]. Her signature alternating bass style is now known as "Cotten picking". Her [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]] techniques have influenced many other musicians.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jones|first=Josh|date=May 1, 2019|title=Elizabeth Cotten Wrote "Freight Train" at 11, Won a Grammy at 90, and Changed American Music In-Between|url=http://www.openculture.com/2019/05/elizabeth-cotten-wrote-freight-train-at-11.html|access-date=2020-08-08|website=Open Culture|language=en-US}}</ref>
