==Early life==
Harris was born on May 31, 1997,<ref>{{cite tweet |last=Harris |first=Elizabeth |author-link= |user=CupcakKe_rapper |number=860207849506471936|date=May 4, 2017 |title= Yes I am 19 turning 20 on May 31 |language=English |link=https://twitter.com/CupcakKe_rapper/status/860207849506471936 |access-date=May 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20170505115326/https://twitter.com/CupcakKe_rapper/status/860207849506471936 |archive-date=May 5, 2017}}</ref> in [[Chicago, Illinois]], and was raised on [[King Drive (CTA station)|King Drive]], near [[Parkway Garden Homes|Parkway Gardens]]. Harris was raised by a single mother and spent nearly four years in Chicago's homeless shelters starting at age seven.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Downing|first1=Andy|title=Concert preview: Chicago rapper Cupcakke brings her "Vagina" monologue to MINT|url=http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2016/05/19/concert-preview-chicago-rapper-cupcakke-brings-her-vagina-monologue-to-mint.html|website=columbusalive.com|publisher=Columbus Alive|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208083531/http://www.columbusalive.com/content/stories/2016/05/19/concert-preview-chicago-rapper-cupcakke-brings-her-vagina-monologue-to-mint.html|archive-date=February 8, 2017|access-date=May 29, 2018}}</ref> She grew up and went to school with other established Chicago rappers such as [[Lil Reese]] and [[Chief Keef]]. She got an early start into music and poetry at the age of ten by her involvement in her local church. It was also there that she got her start in performing, where she would perform for her local pastors by reciting poetry about her [[Christianity in the United States|Christianity]] and faith.<ref name=":010">{{cite web|last1=Carvey|first1=Meghan|title= The True, Freaky Originality of CupcakKe – MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2946572/cupcakke-audacious-tracey-emin-unlikeable-women/|access-date=January 19, 2017|date=November 24, 2016}}</ref>

When she was 13, she met a fellow church-goer who encouraged her to turn the poetry into [[rap music]], and she became infatuated with the art form. She cites [[50 Cent]], [[Lil' Kim]], and [[Da Brat]] as early influences to her musical style.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Drake|first1=David|title=A Conversation With CupcakKe, Whose Explicit Sex Raps Are Just the Tip of the Iceberg|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/04/cupcakke-interview-on-growing-up-chicago-explicit-raps|website=Complex.com|access-date=July 18, 2016|date=April 7, 2016}}</ref><ref name=":010" />

==Life and career==
===2012–2014: Early output===
Harris released her first music video, "Gold Digger" onto her official YouTube channel in August 2012. She was only 15 at the time of its release—the original video has since been deleted.<ref name=":0"/> Over the next few years, she continued to release original music, as well as freestyles using beats from other artists through her [[YouTube]] channel, where she has amassed over 650,000 subscribers.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/CupcakKeFisno |title=cupcakKe – YouTube |website=Youtube | language=en|access-date=January 19, 2017 }}</ref>

===2015–2016: ''Cum Cake'', ''S.T.D (Shelters to Deltas)'', and ''Audacious''===
In October 2015, the official music video for her song "Vagina" was released on YouTube via YMCFilmz. According to Cupcakke, she wrote the song because she was inspired by [[Khia]]'s song "[[My Neck, My Back (Lick It)]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.out.com/music/2017/3/30/kiki-cupcakke-audacious-rapper-queer-icon-making|title=A Kiki with CupcakKe: The Audacious Rapper Is a Queer Icon in the Making|last=Zane|first=Zachary|date=March 30, 2017|website=[[Out (magazine)#History|Out]]|publisher=[[Here Media|Here Media Inc.]]|access-date=April 19, 2017}}</ref> One month later, Harris released "Deepthroat" on her own channel. Within weeks, the two videos went viral on YouTube, Worldstar, and [[Facebook]]. The songs later became singles for Harris' debut mixtape, ''[[Cum Cake]]'', which was released in February 2016. Its release was also supported by further singles such as "Juicy Coochie", "Tit for Tat", and "Pedophile". A writer for ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', which included it on "9 Rap Mixtapes You Might Have Missed This Year", called the mixtape a "well rounded introduction to a skilled writer" and said it used songs "about love, loss, and hardship with its more explicit tracks to create a full profile of the up-and-coming Chicago rapper".<ref name="pitchfork.com">{{cite web|last1=Pearce|first1=Sheldon|title=9 Great Rap Mixtapes You Might Have Missed This Year|url=http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1219-9-great-rap-mixtapes-you-might-have-missed-this-year/|website=Pitchfork|date=July 6, 2016|access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref> "Pedophile" was also specifically noted for its "blunt commentary" on [[sexual assault]].<ref name=":0"/>

In June 2016, Harris released her second mixtape, ''[[S.T.D (Shelters to Deltas)]]''. It was preceded by the single "Best Dick Sucker". Other tracks, such as "Doggy Style" and "Motherlands", were also later released as singles. The mixtape was listed among ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]''{{'s}} "Best Rap Albums of 2016 So Far".<ref name="rollingstone1"/>{{failed verification|date=December 2020}}

In October 2016, Harris released her debut studio album, ''[[Audacious (album)|Audacious]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2016/10/06/cupcakke-announces-new-album-audacious|title=CupcakKe Announces New Album "Audacious"|website=Fader.com|access-date=January 23, 2017}}</ref> The album was preceded by the single "Picking Cotton", which was described by [[MTV News]] as "a [[Protest songs in the United States|protest song]] about [[Racism in the United States|racist]] [[Police brutality in the United States|cops]]".<ref name=":010"/> Other tracks on the album such as "Spider-Man Dick" and "LGBT" were accompanied by music videos. In an interview Harris stated that she made the song "LGBT" "...strictly for the [[gay community]] to know that they are loved and don't need to feel judged."

In February 2017, Harris released "Cumshot", which served as the lead single to her second studio album. On March 7, English singer-songwriter [[Charli XCX]] premiered her song "Lipgloss", which featured Harris. The song was later included on XCX's mixtape, ''[[Number 1 Angel]]'', which was released on March 10.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/03/07/charlie-xcx-announced-inumber-1-angeli-mixtape-shared-three-new-songs|title=Charli XCX Announced Number 1 Angel Mixtape, Shared Three New Songs|website=The FADER|access-date=March 7, 2017}}</ref>

On April 7, 2017, ''Queen Elizabitch'' was removed from online streaming services and digital music stores due to an illegal backing track that Harris had purchased from what she described as a "shady producer".

It was released on YouTube and sees Harris take aim at [[Megan Thee Stallion]], [[Lizzo]], and Lil' Kim, among others.<ref name="HowToRob" /> The song received positive reviews.

On March 1, 2021, "Deepthroat" was certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), which denotes five hundred thousand units based on sales and track-equivalent on-demand streams.<ref>{{cite certification|region=United States|artist=Cupcakke|accessdate=March 1, 2021}}</ref>

''Rolling Stone'' magazine reported in June 2021 that Harris will be co-hosting the upcoming [[OutTV (Canadian TV channel)|OutTV]] reality show ''[[Hot Haus]]'' with [[Tiffany Pollard]], which will mark the rapper's TV hosting debut. Harris said of the casting decision, "As soon as I heard what this show stood for, owning your sexuality and talent, I knew I had to be involved."<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Dickson|first=E.

Starting in June 2021, remixes of various songs featuring vocals from Harris' singles "Deepthroat" and "Vagina" began circulating on the video-sharing app [[TikTok]]. This has been described as one of the app's most popular and longest-running trends.<ref>{{Cite web|first=Layla|last=Halabian|url=https://www.nylon.com/life/cupcakke-tiktok-remixes-vagina|title = Help!
