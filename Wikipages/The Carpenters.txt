'''The Carpenters''' (officially known as '''Carpenters'''){{efn|Even though they are referred to as "The Carpenters", their official name for authorized recordings and press material is simply "Carpenters".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=49}}}} were an American vocal and instrumental duo consisting of siblings [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]] (1950–1983) and [[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] (born 1946). They produced a distinct soft musical style, combining Karen's [[contralto]] vocals with Richard's harmonizing, arranging and composition skills. During their 14-year career, the Carpenters recorded 10 albums along with numerous singles and several television specials.

The siblings were born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], and moved to [[Downey, California]], in 1963. Richard took piano lessons as a child, progressing to [[California State University, Long Beach]], while Karen learned the drums. They first performed together as a duo in 1965 and formed the [[jazz]]-oriented Richard Carpenter Trio followed by the [[Middle of the road (music)|middle-of-the-road]] group Spectrum. Signing as Carpenters to [[A&M Records]] in 1969, they achieved major success the following year with the hit singles "[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]" and "[[We've Only Just Begun]]". The duo's brand of melodic [[pop music|pop]] produced a record-breaking run of hit recordings on the [[American Top&nbsp;40]] and [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] charts, and they became leading sellers in the [[soft rock]], [[easy listening]] and [[adult contemporary music]] genres. They had three number-one singles and five number-two singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot&nbsp;100]] and 15 number-one hits on the Adult Contemporary chart, in addition to 12 top-10 singles.

The duo toured continually during the 1970s, which put them under increased strain; Richard took a year off in 1979 after he had become addicted to [[Methaqualone|Quaalude]], while Karen suffered from [[anorexia nervosa]]. Their joint career ended in 1983 when Karen died from [[heart failure]] brought on by complications of anorexia. Extensive news coverage surrounding these circumstances increased public awareness of [[eating disorder]]s. Their music continues to attract critical acclaim and commercial success. They have sold more than 90&nbsp;million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].

==History==
===Pre-Carpenters===
==== Childhood ====
The Carpenter siblings were both born at Grace–New Haven Hospital (now called [[Yale–New Haven Hospital]]) in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], to Harold Bertram Carpenter (1908–1988) and Agnes Reuwer (née Tatum, 1915–1996). Harold was born in [[Wuzhou]], China, moving to Britain in 1917, and the US in 1921, while Agnes was born and grew up in [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. They married on April 9, 1935; their first child, Richard Lynn, was born on October 15, 1946, while Karen Anne followed on March 2, 1950.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=11–14, 297}} Richard was a quiet child who spent most of his time at home listening to [[Sergei Rachmaninoff|Rachmaninoff]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]], [[Red Nichols]] and [[Spike Jones]], and playing the piano.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=14}} Karen was friendly and outgoing; she liked to play sports, including softball with the neighborhood kids, but still spent a lot of time listening to music. She enjoyed dancing and began ballet and tap classes aged four.  Karen and Richard were close, and shared a common interest in music. In particular, they became fans of [[Les Paul and Mary Ford]], whose music featured multiple [[overdubbing|overdubbed]] voices and instruments.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=16}} Richard began piano lessons aged eight, but quickly grew frustrated with the formal direction of the lessons and quit after a year. He had begun to teach himself how to play by ear by 11, and resumed studying with a different teacher. He took a greater interest in playing this time, and would frequently practice at home. By age 14, he was interested in performing professionally, and started lessons at [[Yale School of Music]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=18–19}}

In June 1963, the Carpenter family moved to the [[Los Angeles]] suburb of [[Downey, California|Downey]] hoping that it would mean better musical opportunities for Richard.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=47}}<ref name="npr.org"/>{{sfn|Lott|2008|p=226}} He was asked to be the organist for weddings and services at the local Methodist church; instead of playing traditional hymns, he would sometimes rearrange contemporary [[The Beatles|Beatles]] songs in a "church" style.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=22–23}} In late 1964, Richard enrolled at [[California State University, Long Beach|California State College at Long Beach]] where he met future songwriting partner [[John Bettis]], Wesley Jacobs, a friend who played the bass and [[tuba]] for the Richard Carpenter Trio, and choral director [[Frank Pooler]], who co-wrote the Christmas [[Standard (music)|standard]] "[[Merry Christmas Darling]]" in 1966.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=53}}

That same year, Karen enrolled at [[Downey High School]], where she found she had a knack for playing the drums.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=51}} She had initially tried playing the [[glockenspiel]], but had been inspired by her friend Frankie Chavez, who had been drumming since he was three. She became enthusiastic about the drums, and began to learn complex pieces, such as [[Dave Brubeck]]'s "[[Take Five]]".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=24–25}} Chavez persuaded her parents to buy a [[Ludwig Drums|Ludwig]] drum kit in late 1964, and she began lessons with local jazz players, including how to read concert music. She quickly replaced the entry-level kit with a large Ludwig set that was a similar set-up to Brubeck's drummer, [[Joe Morello]]. Richard and Karen gave their first public performance together in 1965, as part of the [[Pit orchestra|pit band]] for a local production of ''[[Guys and Dolls]].{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=52}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=27}}

==== The Richard Carpenter Trio and Spectrum ====

By 1965, Karen had been practicing the drums for a year, and Richard was refining his piano techniques under Pooler's tuition. Late that year, Richard teamed up with Jacobs, who played tuba and [[Double bass|stand-up bass]]. With Karen drumming, the three formed the [[jazz]]-oriented Richard Carpenter Trio.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=53}} Richard led the band and wrote all the arrangements, and they began to rehearse daily.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=28}} He bought a tape recorder, and began to make recordings of the group. Originally, neither Karen nor Richard sang; Richard's friend Dan Friberg occasionally filled in on trumpet, along with guest vocalist Margaret Shanor.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=29}}

Karen subsequently became more confident in singing, and began to take lessons with Frank Pooler. He taught her a mixture of classical and pop singing, but realized she most enjoyed performing Richard's new material. Pooler later said, "Karen was a born pop singer".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=29–30}} In early 1966, Karen tagged along at a late-night session in the garage studio of Los Angeles bassist [[Joe Osborn]], and joined future Carpenters collaborator and lyricist John Bettis at a demo session where Richard was to accompany Friberg.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=32}}{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=58}} Asked to sing, she performed for Osborn, who was immediately impressed with her vocal abilities. He signed Karen to his label, Magic Lamp Records, and Richard to his publishing arm, Lightup Music.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=33}} The label put out a single featuring two of Richard's compositions, "Looking for Love" and "I'll Be Yours". As well as Karen's vocals, the track was backed by the Richard Carpenter Trio. The single was not a commercial success due to a lack of promotion, and the label folded the next year.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=33–34}}

In mid-1966, the Richard Carpenter Trio entered the [[Hollywood Bowl]] annual [[Battle of the Bands]] competition. They played an instrumental version of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]" and their own piece, "Iced Tea". They won the competition on June 24 and were signed by [[RCA Records]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=34}} They recorded songs such as the Beatles' "[[Every Little Thing (Beatles song)|Every Little Thing]]" and [[Frank Sinatra]]'s "[[Strangers in the Night]]". A committee reviewed their recordings and chose not to produce them, so the trio were released from RCA.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=59}}{{efn|In 1991, some 25 years later, a couple of these recordings were released as part of a ''[[From the Top (album)|From the Top]]'' [[Box set|boxed set]] of Carpenters material.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=59}}}}

Karen graduated from high school in early 1967, and was awarded the [[John Philip Sousa]] Band award.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=37}} She subsequently joined Richard at Long Beach State as a music major.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=41}} Osborn let Karen and Richard continue to use his studio to record demo tapes.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=45}} As they had unlimited studio time, Richard decided to experiment with overdubbing his and Karen's voices in order to create a large choral sound.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=48}}

In 1967, Jacobs left to study classical music and join the [[Detroit Symphony Orchestra]], and the Richard Carpenter Trio disbanded.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=42, 63}} Richard and Bettis then were hired as musicians at a refreshment shop at [[Disneyland]]'s [[Main Street, U.S.A.]].  They were expected to play turn of the 20th century songs in keeping with the shop's theme. The shop's patrons had other ideas; many requested the musicians to play current popular music.  When the pair tried pleasing their customers and honoring the requests, they were fired by a Disneyland supervisor, Victor Guder, for being "too radical".{{sfn|Stanton|2003|p=34}}<ref name=Guder>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14336861/mr_guder/|title=North Augusta Student Meets The Carpenters|date=December 5, 1972|page=6|publisher=Aiken Standard|access-date=October 11, 2017|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011142826/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14336861/mr_guder/|archive-date=October 11, 2017}} {{Open access}}</ref> Bettis and Richard were unhappy about their dismissal and wrote the song "Mr. Guder" about their former superior.<ref name=Guder/>

{{anchor|Spectrum}}Richard and Karen then teamed up with student musicians from Long Beach State to form the band '''Spectrum'''.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=63}} The group included Bettis on guitar, who began writing lyrics to Richard's songs, guitarist Gary Sims, bassist Dan Woodhams, and vocalist Leslie "Toots" Johnston.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=39, 43}} The group sent demos to various record labels around Los Angeles, with little success. Part of the problem was the group's middle-of-the-road sound, which was different from the [[psychedelic rock]] popular in clubs.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=45}} Richard's friend Ed Sulzer managed to book time at United Audio Recording Studio in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], and the group recorded several original songs including "Candy" (which became "One Love" on the Carpenters' [[Carpenters (album)|self-titled 1971 album]]). Richard bought a [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] as an additional instrument to complement his acoustic piano onstage.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=45–46}} Spectrum performed regularly at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] nightclub in Los Angeles, including opening for [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] early in that group's career.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=47}}{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=54}}

By 1968, Spectrum had disbanded, finding it difficult to get gigs as their music was not considered "danceable" by rock and roll standards.<ref name=Billboard2>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FAkEAAAAMBAJ&q=the+carpenters&pg=RA1-PA13|title=A Talented Brother and Sister Act Which Represents Clean, Wholesome Entertainment|author=Lieberman, Frank H.|journal=Billboard|page=C-10|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|date=November 17, 1973|issn=0006-2510|access-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005202007/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FAkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA13&dq=the+carpenters&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q=the%20carpenters&f=false|archive-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> Having enjoyed their multi-layer sound experiments at Osborn's studio, Richard and Karen decided to formally become a duo, calling themselves Carpenters. Later in the year, the duo received an offer to be on the television program ''Your All American College Show''.

At the same time, the duo were asked to audition for a [[Ford Motor Company]] advertising campaign, which included $50,000 each and a brand new Ford automobile.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=50}} The group accepted the offer, but quickly withdrew it after receiving a formal offer from A&M. Label owner [[Herb Alpert]] was intrigued by Karen's voice, later saying "It touched me ... I felt like it was time". On meeting the duo, Alpert said "Let's hope we can have some hits!"{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=53}}

===As the Carpenters===
==== ''Offering'' (''Ticket to Ride'') ====
Richard and Karen Carpenter signed to A&M Records on April 22, 1969.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=53}} Since Karen was 19 and underage, her parents had to co-sign.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=76}} The duo had decided to sign as "Carpenters", without the definite article, which was influenced by names such as [[Buffalo Springfield]] or [[Jefferson Airplane]], which they considered "hip".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=49}}

When the Carpenters signed to A&M Records, they were given free rein in the studio to create an album in their own style.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=53}} The label recommended that [[Jack Daugherty (musician)|Jack Daugherty]] should produce it, though those present have since suggested that Richard was the ''de facto'' producer. Most of the album's material had already been written for and performed with Spectrum; "Your Wonderful Parade" and "All I Can Do" both came from demos recorded with Osborn. Richard rearranged the Beatles' "[[Ticket to Ride (song)|Ticket to Ride]]" in a melancholic [[ballad]] style.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=54}} Osborn played bass on the album (and remained their regular studio bassist throughout their career). Karen also played bass on "All of My Life" and "Eve", after being taught the relevant parts by Osborn.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=55}}{{efn|Later Carpenters' compilations feature Richard's remixes of these songs, which include Osborn playing the bass.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=55}}}} The album, entitled ''[[Ticket to Ride (album)|Offering]]'', was released on October 9, 1969, to a positive critical reception; one review in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' said "With radio programming support, Carpenters should have a big hit on their hands."{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=55}}

"Ticket to Ride" was released as a single on November 5, and became a minor hit for the Carpenters, peaking at No.&nbsp;54 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and the Top 20 of the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=56}}{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=81}} The album sold only 18,000 copies on its initial run, at a loss for A&M, but after the Carpenters' subsequent breakthrough the album was repackaged and reissued internationally under the name ''Ticket to Ride'' and sold 250,000 copies.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=56, 69}}

==== ''Close to You'' ====
[[File:Karen Carpenter on drumkit.jpg|thumb|300px|alt=Black and white photograph of Karen Carpenter drumming on stage|Karen drumming on stage]]
Despite the poor showing of ''Offering'', A&M retained the Carpenters and decided they should record a hit single instead. In December 1969, they met [[Burt Bacharach]], who was impressed by their work and invited the duo to open for him at a charity concert, which should include them performing a medley of Bacharach / [[Hal David]] songs.{{efn|Bacharach invited the duo to open for him again at the [[NYCB Theatre at Westbury|Westbury Music Fair]] in 1970 as "Close to You" was beginning its climb on the music charts.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/cashbox31unse_44#page/24/mode/2up/search/karen+carpenter|title=The Burt Bacharach Orchestra The Carpenters|journal=Cash Box|date=June 13, 1970|page=24|issn=0008-7289|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref>}} Herb Alpert asked Richard to re-work a Bacharach/David song "[[(They Long to Be) Close to You]]", which had first been recorded in 1963 by [[Richard Chamberlain]], and [[Dionne Warwick]] the following year. Richard Carpenter decided the song would work as a standalone piece, and wrote an arrangement from scratch without being influenced by any earlier recordings.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=57}} The duo struggled on an early recording attempt, and for the second session, Alpert suggested that seasoned session player [[Hal Blaine]] play drums instead of Karen, although Blaine stated that Karen approved of his involvement<ref>{{Cite web|title=Karen Carpenter 1950–1983|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/may-1983-karen-carpenter-1950-1983/|access-date=August 13, 2021|website=Modern Drummer Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref>. [[Larry Knechtel]] was tried out as a session pianist, but was replaced by Richard for the final take.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=58}}  The Carpenters' version was released as a single in March 1970.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=61}} It entered the charts at No.&nbsp;56, the highest debut of the week ending June 20.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=85}} It reached No.&nbsp;1 on July 25 and stayed there for the next four weeks.<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/298754/carpenters/chart|title=Carpenters – Chart history|work=Billboard|at=Select "Hot 100" from the drop-down menu|access-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108231703/http://www.billboard.com/artist/298754/carpenters/chart|archive-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref>

Their next hit was a song Richard had seen in a television commercial for [[Crocker National Bank]], "[[We've Only Just Begun]]", written by [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] and [[Roger Nichols (songwriter)|Roger Nichols]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=60}} Three months after "Close to You" reached No.&nbsp;1, the Carpenters' version of "We've Only Just Begun" reached No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming the first of their eventual five No. 2 hits (it was unable to get past "[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]" by [[The Jackson 5]] and "[[I Think I Love You]]" by [[The Partridge Family]] during its four-week stay). The song became the first hit single for Williams and Nichols, who think the Carpenters' version is definitive.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=66}}

"Close to You" and "We've Only Just Begun" became [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] [[Music recording sales certification|gold singles]] and were featured on the best-selling album ''[[Close to You (The Carpenters album)|Close to You]]'', which placed No.&nbsp;175 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]] list in 2003.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|title=Rolling Stone Magazine: 500 Greatest Albums|journal=Rolling Stone|date=November 18, 2003|access-date=March 8, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/667irKqv6?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-19691231|archive-date=March 13, 2012}}</ref> The album also included "Mr. Guder", the song inspired by Disneyland supervisor Victor Guder, who had dismissed the young songwriters for playing popular music when they worked at the park.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=66–67}}<ref name=Guder/>

The Carpenters began touring, attempting to recruit Jacobs and former Spectrum members. Jacobs decided to continue with the Detroit Symphony, but Woodhams and Sims agreed to be part of the live band, which was completed with Doug Strawn and Bob Messenger. They rehearsed daily on the A&M soundstage in order to present a concert show that could compare with their records. As a result of their chart success, the group made several television appearances in 1970, including ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=63}} The Carpenters also chose Sherwin Bash as their new manager around this time.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=68–69}} On Thanksgiving Day, 1970, the Carpenter family moved into a new $300,000 (${{inflation|US|300000|1970|fmt=c|r=-3}} as of {{inflation_year|US}}) home near the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=70}}{{efn|By 1972, both Richard and Karen were millionaires.

The duo rounded out the year with the holiday release of "Merry Christmas, Darling", which they had been playing for several years. The single scored high on the holiday charts and would repeatedly return to the holiday charts in subsequent years.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=180}} In 1978, Karen re-cut the vocal for their Christmas TV special, feeling she could give a more mature treatment to it; this remake also became a hit.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=180–81}}

==== ''Carpenters'' and ''A Song for You'' ====
[[File:Carpenters LOGO.png|thumb|right|alt=The Carpenters logo |The Carpenters logo, originally designed for their [[eponym]]ous album]]
The Carpenters had a string of hit singles and albums through the early 1970s. Their 1971 song "[[For All We Know (1970 song)|For All We Know]]" was recorded the previous year by members of the pop group [[Bread (band)|Bread]] for a wedding scene in the movie ''[[Lovers and Other Strangers]]''. Richard saw the song's potential for the Carpenters and recorded it in the autumn of 1970. The track became the duo's third gold single, and later won an Oscar for "Best Original Song".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=73}}{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=100}} On March 16, 1971, the duo received [[Grammy Award]] nominations for Best New Artist and Best Contemporary Performance by a Duo, Group or Chorus.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=74}}

The duo's fourth gold single, "[[Rainy Days and Mondays]]", became Williams' and Nichols' second major single with the Carpenters. The demo was written by Williams about his mother, which led to the line, "Talking to myself and feeling old". Richard rearranged the song to include a saxophone solo, played by Bob Messenger. The single peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=75–76}}

"[[Superstar (Delaney and Bonnie song)|Superstar]]", written by [[Bonnie Bramlett]] and [[Leon Russell]], became the duo's next hit. The song had originally appeared on [[Joe Cocker]]'s 1970 album ''[[Mad Dogs & Englishmen (album)|Mad Dogs & Englishmen]]'', sung by [[Rita Coolidge]]. Karen was familiar with the album, but Richard first heard the song when it was covered by [[Bette Midler]] on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', and realised its potential as a Carpenters hit. The duo changed the line "I can hardly wait to sleep with you again" to "... to ''be'' with you again", as they knew the former would not be played on Top 40 radio.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=77–78}} The single sold a million copies, attaining gold status, and became the Carpenters' third No.&nbsp;2 single on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 (this time held off the top spot by [[Rod Stewart]]'s "[[Maggie May]]" / "[[Reason to Believe]]").{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=78}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|p=49}} On May 14, 1971, the Carpenters performed a sell-out show at [[Carnegie Hall]],{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=79}} and they released their third album, ''[[Carpenters (album)|Carpenters]]'' the same day.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=80}} It became one of their best sellers, earning RIAA certification for platinum four times,<ref name=RIAA /> and rising to No. 2 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s pop album chart for two weeks (behind Carole King's ''[[Tapestry (Carole King album)|Tapestry]]'') with over a million pre-sales orders.

Shortly after the third album, the duo recorded a short television series, ''[[Make Your Own Kind of Music (TV series)|Make Your Own Kind of Music]]'', which drew mixed reviews.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=81}} By mid-1971, the Carpenters were being criticized that their live shows had no focal point, as Karen was seated behind the drums. Richard and Bash tried to persuade her to sing out-front.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=84–85}} Karen resisted at first, but was eventually persuaded to front the popular numbers and ballads, and drum for more up-tempo numbers. Consequently, Jim Anthony was hired as a touring drummer.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=86}} Over time, Karen became more relaxed as a frontwoman and centerpiece of the band.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=87}}

Later that year, Richard was watching a [[Bing Crosby]] movie, ''[[Rhythm on the River]]'', in which Crosby played a country singer whose career was in decline and whose most famous song was "Goodbye to Love". The song was never performed in the film, so Richard imagined what it might sound like and wrote down some initial lyrics. These were finished off by Bettis, and became "[[Goodbye to Love]]".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=87}} For the arrangement, Richard suggested adding a [[Distortion (music)|fuzz guitar]] solo. He resisted suggestions to get an experienced session player in, and instead asked [[Tony Peluso]], whose band Instant Joy had supported the Carpenters on an earlier tour. Peluso was a typical rock guitarist and did not read music, so Richard wrote out a [[chord chart]] for him to follow. Having been instructed to play the first five bars of the melody and then improvise, he recorded the solo in two takes. Bettis later described "Goodbye to Love" as his favorite single he has worked on in his career.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=88}} The single reached No.&nbsp;7 in the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and Peluso accepted an offer to tour with the Carpenters full-time.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=127}} Some did not appreciate the combination of a soft ballad and loud electric guitar, and sent hate mail to the Carpenters, but conversely they picked up new fans who appreciated the bridge between rock and pop.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=88}}

On April 25, 1972, the Carpenters visited the [[White House]] to meet presidential assistants James Cavanagh, Ken Cole and Ronald Zeigler. They returned on August 1 to meet [[Richard Nixon|President Richard Nixon]] and posed for photographs with him at the [[Oval Office]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=99}}

"Goodbye to Love" was featured on the Carpenters' fourth album, ''[[A Song for You (The Carpenters album)|A Song for You]]'' released on June 13, 1972. The title track, a cover of a song on Leon Russell's [[Leon Russell (album)|debut album]], was considered as a single, but rejected owing to its length. The album also included a Carole King song, "It's Going To Take Some Time" and another Nichols / Williams original, "I Won't Last A Day Without You".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=90}} Another Carpenter / Bettis composition, "[[Top of the World (The Carpenters song)|Top of the World]]", was originally intended as just an album cut, but after [[Lynn Anderson]] scored a hit with the song in early 1973, the Carpenters opted to record their own single version. It was released in September and became the Carpenters' second ''Billboard'' No.&nbsp;1 hit, in December.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=122}}

==== ''Now & Then'' ====

The Carpenters met the President again on April 30, 1973, when they performed a special concert at the White House, though the event was overshadowed by the resignation of the [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[Bob Haldeman]], and assistant [[John Ehrlichman]] over the [[Watergate scandal]], which would ultimately also lead to Nixon's resignation.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=100}}

Their next album, ''[[Now & Then (The Carpenters album)|Now & Then]]'', was named by the duo's mother, Agnes. It contained ''[[Sesame Street|Sesame Street's]]'' signature song "[[Sing (Joe Raposo song)|Sing]]", featuring the Jimmy Joice Children's Choir, which was released as a single, reaching No.&nbsp;3 on the Hot 100.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=102}}{{sfn|Simpson|2011|p=46}} The album also included a Leon Russell composition, "[[This Masquerade]]", and the ambitious "[[Yesterday Once More (song)|Yesterday Once More]]", a side-long tribute to [[oldies]] radio which incorporated renditions of eight hit songs from previous decades into a faux oldies radio program.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=102–03}}{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=135}} The single version of the latter became their biggest hit in the United Kingdom, holding the No. 2 spot for two weeks,<ref name="UK charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/carpenters/ |title=Carpenters &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=April 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140709061735/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/carpenters/ |archive-date=July 9, 2014 }}</ref> and became the Carpenters' biggest worldwide hit.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=104}}

The Carpenters did not record a new album in 1974. They had been touring extensively and were exhausted; Richard later said, "there was simply no time to make one. Nor was I in the mood."{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=137}} Tensions had erupted in the family unit; Richard had started dating the group's hairdresser but neither Agnes nor Karen took kindly to her and she ultimately ended the relationship and quit the band's services. Agnes had always praised Richard's musical talents, which Karen resented.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=113–14}} The duo ultimately moved out of their parents' house; at first the siblings shared a home.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=115}}{{sfn|Lott|2008|p=230}} In May, the Carpenters undertook their first tour of Japan, playing to 85,000 fans. They later likened the scenes when they first touched down at [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo Airport]] to [[Beatlemania]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=123}}

During this period, the pair released just one single, "[[I Won't Last a Day Without You]]" from ''A Song for You''. The Carpenters finally decided to release their original two years after its original album release and some months after [[Maureen McGovern]]'s 1973 cover.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_IWon'tLastADay.htm |title=Carpenters •• I Won't Last A Day Without You |publisher=Richard and Karen Carpenter (official website) |date=June 4, 2008 |access-date=April 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221032758/http://richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_IWon%27tLastADay.htm |archive-date=December 21, 2013 }}</ref> In March 1974, the single version became the fifth and final selection from the album to chart in the Top 20, reaching No.&nbsp;11 on the Hot 100 in May.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |author-link=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=107}}</ref>

In place of a new album, their first [[Greatest hits album|greatest hits package]] was released, featuring [[remix]]es of their singles, and newly recorded leads and bridges that allowed each side of the album to play through with no breaks.

In 1975, the Carpenters had a hit with a remake of [[the Marvelettes]]' chart-topping 1961 single, "[[Please Mr. Postman]]". The song topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in January and became the duo's third and final No.&nbsp;1 pop single.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=125}} It also earned Karen and Richard their record-setting twelfth million-selling gold single in the US.<ref name=RIAA /> The follow-up, a Carpenter / Bettis composition "[[Only Yesterday (song)|Only Yesterday]]", was the duo's last Hot 100 top 10 hit, reaching No.&nbsp;4.<ref name="officialsiteonlyyesterday">{{cite web |url=http://www.richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_OnlyYesterday.htm |title=Carpenters •• Only Yesterday |publisher=Richard and Karen Carpenter (official website) |date=June 4, 2008 |access-date=April 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020210715/http://www.richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_OnlyYesterday.htm |archive-date=October 20, 2014 }}</ref> The sound on the track was intended to emulate [[Phil Spector]]'s famous [[Wall of Sound]] production technique.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=137}}

Both singles appeared on their 1975 LP ''[[Horizon (The Carpenters album)|Horizon]]'', which also included covers of the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]' "[[Desperado (Eagles song)|Desperado]]" and [[Neil Sedaka]]'s "[[Solitaire (Neil Sedaka song)|Solitaire]]", which became a moderate hit later that year.

The Carpenters toured with Sedaka during 1975, but critics found the latter's performances to be more professional and entertaining.

==== ''A Kind of Hush'' and ''Passage'' ====
Their next album, ''[[A Kind of Hush (album)|A Kind of Hush]]'', was released on June 11, 1976, and was certified gold.<ref name=RIAA /> However, it was the first Carpenters' album not to become platinum-certified since ''Ticket to Ride'' seven years earlier. The duo had several hits that year, but by this time the public had become over-familiar with them, and sales fell.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=170}} Their biggest single that year was a cover of [[Herman's Hermits]]' "[[There's a Kind of Hush|There's a Kind of Hush (All Over the World)]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. "[[I Need to Be in Love]]" (Karen's favorite song by the Carpenters){{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=157}}{{sfn|Tobler|1998|p=71}} charted at No.&nbsp;25 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

''[[The Carpenters' Very First TV Special|The Carpenters' Very First Television Special]]'' aired on December 8, 1976, and included guests [[John Denver]] and [[Victor Borge]]. It was the duo's first headlining television variety show in the US.

The 1977 album, ''[[Passage (The Carpenters album)|Passage]]'', marked an attempt to venture into other musical genres.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=172}}  It featured an unlikely mix of [[jazz fusion]] ("B'wana She No Home"), [[Calypso music|calypso]] ("Man Smart, Woman Smarter"), and orchestrated balladry ("[[I Just Fall in Love Again]]", "Two Sides"), and included the hits, "[[All You Get from Love Is a Love Song]]" and "[[Calling Occupants of Interplanetary Craft]]".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=172}} "Calling Occupants" was supported with the TV special ''[[The Carpenters...Space Encounters|Space Encounters]]'', which aired May 17, 1978, with guest stars [[Suzanne Somers]] and [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]. Although the single release of "Calling Occupants" became a significant Top 10 hit in the UK and reached No.&nbsp;1 in [[Ireland]], it only peaked at number 32 on the Hot 100, and for the first time a Carpenters album did not reach the gold threshold of 500,000 copies shipped in the US.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=231}} In early 1978, they had a surprise Top 10 country hit with the up-tempo, fiddle-sweetened "[[Sweet, Sweet Smile]]", written by country-pop singer [[Juice Newton]] and her long-time musical partner [[Otha Young]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=174}}

==== ''The Singles: 1974–1978'' ====
In place of a new album for 1978, a second compilation, ''[[The Singles: 1974–1978]]'', was released in the UK where it reached No.&nbsp;2 in the charts. In the US, their first Christmas album, ''[[Christmas Portrait]]'', became a seasonal favorite, and was certified platinum. Richard later said that the album should have been released as Karen's first solo album. It was shortly followed by the television special ''[[A Christmas Portrait TV Special|The Carpenters: A Christmas Portrait]]''.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=182}} During the sessions, several non-Christmas songs were recorded such as "Where Do I Go from Here", which was not released until after Karen's death.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=294}}

==== Hiatus ====
By 1978, Richard had become addicted to [[Methaqualone|Quaaludes]], which he had been taking on prescription in increasing doses since the 1971 tours. On September 4, during an engagement at the MGM Grand in [[Las Vegas]], he decided to quit touring, and the concerts there were curtailed.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=183–84}} On December 3, the Carpenters were scheduled to play at the [[Pacific Terrace Theatre]], [[Long Beach Convention Center]], which turned out to be the last live concert that Karen and Richard played together.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=185}} Richard refused to fly to the UK for an appearance on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[Bruce Forsyth's Big Night]]'', realizing he had a serious problem, so Karen performed without him and denied rumors that the duo were to split.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=186–87}}

Richard began treatment for his addiction at a facility in [[Topeka, Kansas]], for six weeks in January 1979.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=188}} He decided to take the rest of the year off to relax and rehabilitate. Richard was now sure that Karen was battling with [[anorexia nervosa]], but she denied it, saying she simply had [[colitis]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=189}} Karen did not want to take a break from singing nor seek professional medical help for her own condition, so she decided to pursue a [[Karen Carpenter (album)|solo album]] project with producer [[Phil Ramone]] in New York.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=192, 194}}{{efn|In 1978, Karen was asked to sing on [[Gene Simmons]]' first [[Gene Simmons (album)|solo album]].

Her mother Agnes did not like Karen working without Richard,{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=207}} while Richard felt that Karen was not well enough to have worked on the album. The total cost of recording was $500,000 of which $400,000 came from the Carpenters' own funds.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=208–09}} The album was not released and although the press announced it was canceled at Karen's request, its rejection devastated her; she felt she had just wasted months of work.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=212–13, 219}} It was finally issued in 1996, 13 years after Karen's death.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=311}}

==== ''Made in America'' and Karen's final days ====
Following the cancellation of her solo album and her marriage to Tom Burris on August 31, 1980, Karen decided to record a new album with Richard, who had now recovered from his addiction and was ready to continue their career.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=227, 234}} The Carpenters produced their final television special in 1980, called ''[[The Carpenters: Music, Music, Music|Music, Music, Music!]]'', with guest stars [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=224}}  Karen's outfit for the show was designed by [[Bill Belew]], who was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for best costume design.

The album also produced three other singles, including "[[(Want You) Back in My Life Again]]", "[[Those Good Old Dreams]]", and a remake of the Motown hit "[[Beechwood 4-5789]]". The singles fared well on the adult contemporary charts.

==== Karen's death ====
On February 1, 1983, Karen and Richard met for dinner and discussed future plans for the Carpenters, including a return to touring.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=272}} On February 3, Karen visited her parents, and discussed finalizing her divorce from Burris.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=273}} The following morning, her mother found her lying unresponsive on the floor of a [[walk-in closet]], and she was rushed to the hospital.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=276}} After Richard and his parents spent 20 minutes in a waiting room, a doctor entered and told them Karen had died.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=278}} The autopsy stated that her death was caused by "emetine cardiotoxicity due to or as a consequence of anorexia nervosa."{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=283}} Under the anatomical summary, the first item was heart failure, followed by anorexia. The third finding was [[cachexia]], which is extremely low weight and weakness and general body decline associated with chronic disease. Emetine cardiotoxicity implied that Karen abused [[Syrup of ipecac|ipecac syrup]], although there was no other evidence to suggest that she did as her brother and family never found ipecac vials in her apartment, even after her death.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|pp=21–24}}

Karen's funeral was at the Downey United Methodist Church on February 8, 1983.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=287}} More than a thousand mourners attended, among them her friends [[Dorothy Hamill]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Petula Clark]], Dionne Warwick and Herb Alpert.<ref name=funeral>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=13948508|title=1,000 Attend Rites for Karen Carpenter|author=Markel, Michelle|date=February 9, 1983|page=5|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=September 23, 2017|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924001621/https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=13948508|archive-date=September 24, 2017}} {{Open access}}</ref><ref name=rites>{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=13948508|title=1,000 Attend Rites for Karen Carpenter|author=Markel, Michelle|date=February 9, 1983|page=24|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=September 23, 2017|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924001621/https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=13948508|archive-date=September 24, 2017}} {{Open access}}</ref>{{sfn|Petrucelli|2009}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2012|p=245}}<!-- {{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=?}}-->

Following Karen's death, Richard has continued to produce recordings of the duo's music, including several albums of previously unreleased material and numerous compilations. The posthumous ''[[Voice of the Heart]]'' was released in late 1983 and included some tracks left off ''Made in America'' and earlier albums.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=292}} It peaked at No.&nbsp;46 and was certified gold.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=309}} Two singles were released, "[[Make Believe It's Your First Time]]", a second version of a song Karen had recorded for her solo album, and "Your Baby Doesn't Love You Anymore".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=309}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_MakeBelieveIt'sYourFirstTime.htm|title=Make Believe It's Your First Time|publisher=Richard and Karen Carpenter (official website)|access-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314191434/http://www.richardandkarencarpenter.com/SN_MakeBelieveIt%27sYourFirstTime.htm|archive-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref>

For the second Christmas season following Karen's death, Richard constructed a new Carpenters' Christmas album entitled ''[[An Old-Fashioned Christmas]]'', using outtakes from ''Christmas Portrait'' and recording new material around it.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=309}} Richard released his first solo album, ''[[Time (Richard Carpenter album)|Time]]'', in 1987, sharing vocals between himself, Dionne Warwick and [[Dusty Springfield]]. The track "When Time Was All We Had" was a tribute to Karen.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=292}} The same year, [[Todd Haynes]] released the short film ''[[Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story]]'', which featured [[Barbie]] dolls playing the main cast. Richard objected to music being used in the film without his consent, and served an injunction in 1990 that prevented it from being shown.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=292–93}} On January 1, 1989, the television special ''[[The Karen Carpenter Story]]'' premiered on CBS, topping the ratings for that week.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=293}} It included the previously unreleased "You're the One" and "Where Do I Go from Here" in its soundtrack, which were released on the album ''[[Lovelines]]'' later that year.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=294}}

Richard married his (adopted) first cousin, Mary Rudolph, on May 19, 1984.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hoerburger|first1=Rob|title=Karen Carpenter's Second Life|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/06/magazine/karen-carpenter-s-second-life.html?pagewanted=3|work=The New York Times|access-date=August 4, 2015|quote=[I]n 1984, the year after Karen died, he married his cousin Mary Rudolph and is now the father of four.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701062747/http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/06/magazine/karen-carpenter-s-second-life.html?pagewanted=3|archive-date=July 1, 2015}}</ref> Together, they have four daughters and one son, and live in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], where the couple are supporters of the arts.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=297–98}} In 2004, Richard and his wife pledged a $3&nbsp;million gift to the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza Foundation in memory of Karen. Richard has actively supported the [[Carpenter Performing Arts Center]] at his alma mater, Long Beach State. He continues to make concert appearances, including fundraising efforts for the Carpenter Center.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=298}}

In 2007 and 2009, the current owners of the former Carpenter family home on Newville Avenue, Downey, obtained city permits to tear down the existing buildings to make room for newer and larger structures, despite protests from fans. In February 2008, the campaign was covered in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. At that time an adjacent house that had once served as the band's headquarters and recording studio had already been demolished and the main house was on the verge of being demolished. The original house was featured on the cover of ''Now & Then'' and was where Karen had died. In the words of one fan, "this was our version of [[Graceland]]."<ref name="honoluluadvertiser">{{cite web|url=https://latimes.com/news/local/la-me-carpenters16feb16,0,4160096,full.story |title=Fans love Carpenters but not carpenters |work= Los Angeles Times  |date=February 16, 2008 |access-date=April 25, 2014}}{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

== Musical style ==
===Richard===
[[File:Wurlitzer Console (brighten).jpg|thumb|left|alt=Photograph of the front of a Wurlitzer electric piano, showing keyboard|A [[Wurlitzer electric piano]] similar to that used by Richard in the Carpenters]]
Richard Carpenter was the creative force behind the Carpenters' sound. An accomplished keyboard player, composer and arranger, music critic [[Daniel Levitin]] called him "one of the most gifted arrangers to emerge in popular music."{{sfn|Levitin|1995|p=199}}<ref name="levitin">{{cite web| url = http://ccrma.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Courses/192d:1997/rc_arranging.htm| title = Arranging Master Class: Richard Carpenter| access-date = December 27, 2007| author = Levitin, Daniel| date = May 1995| work = Electronic Musician| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040827083313/http://ccrma.stanford.edu/CCRMA/Courses/192d%3A1997/rc_arranging.htm| archive-date = August 27, 2004| df = mdy-all}}</ref> The duo's smooth harmonies were not in step with contemporary music, which was dominated by heavy rock.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=45}} Instead, the Carpenters strove for a rich and melodic sound, along the same vein as [[the Beach Boys]] and [[the Mamas & the Papas]], but with greater fullness and orchestration including frequent use of small string and horn sections and introspective lyrics centred around relationships.{{sfn|Simpson|2011|p=61}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=43, 49}} Richard also admired the musicianship and arranging skills of [[Frank Zappa]], and the two briefly met backstage at the Billboard Forum in 1975. He has credited [[Judd Conlon]] as a key influence on his vocal arranging.<ref name="officialfansaskarchive"/><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-carpenters-up-from-downey-19740704|title=The Carpenters : Up From Downey|journal=Rolling Stone|date=July 4, 1974|access-date=September 30, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170922002030/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-carpenters-up-from-downey-19740704|archive-date=September 22, 2017}}</ref>

Many of Richard's arrangements were classically influenced, featuring strings and occasional brass and woodwind, such as the [[Tijuana Brass]]-style couplets in the chorus of "Superstar", which did not appear in the original. He later said "if you don't have the right arrangement for that song, the singer's going nowhere and neither is the song".{{sfn|Levitin|1995|pp=199, 202}} As well as arranging all of the parts for musicians, he scored [[drum notation]], showing where individual components of a kit were supposed to be played. He also scored bass lines that he knew Joe Osborn would enjoy playing and fit his style. Most Carpenters albums credit Ron Gorow, who sometimes took some of Richard's arrangements worked out on piano, and wrote the actual [[sheet music]] notation onto paper.<ref name="levitin"/>

{{Listen|filename=Superstar.ogg|title=Superstar|description=The chorus illustrates Karen's lead vocal and Richard's arranging skills, including himself on [[Wurlitzer electric piano]], [[Joe Osborn]]'s bass guitar, a [[string section]], and brass couplets.}}
Richard frequently played the Wurlitzer electric piano, which he purchased during his Spectrum days.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=46}} He also played the [[grand piano]], [[Hammond organ]], [[synthesizer]] and the [[harpsichord]]. In the studio, he dubbed the Wurlitzer over acoustic piano parts to thicken the sound. From the mid-1970s, he used [[Rhodes piano|Fender Rhodes pianos]], and kept up to date with music technology.{{sfn|Levitin|1995|p=206}} While touring, he alternated between grand piano, Rhodes and Wurlitzer on stage, for different songs.<ref name="officialfansaskarchive"/>

===Karen===
Karen did not possess a powerful singing voice, but [[close miking]] brought out many nuances in her performances.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=137}} Richard arranged their music to take advantage of this, though Karen had a three-octave vocal range.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=30}}<ref name=md>{{cite journal|url=https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/december-2013-know-karen-carpenter/|title=What Do You Know About…Karen Carpenter?|journal=Modern Drummer|date=December 2013|access-date=September 19, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920092529/https://www.moderndrummer.com/article/december-2013-know-karen-carpenter/|archive-date=September 20, 2017}}</ref> Richard's work with Karen was influenced by the music of [[Les Paul]], whose overdubbing of the voice of wife and musical partner [[Mary Ford]] allowed her to be used as both the lead and harmony vocals.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=16}} By multi-tracking, Richard was able to use Karen and himself for the harmonies to back Karen's lead. The overdubbed background harmonies were distinctive to the Carpenters, but it was the soulful, engaging sound of Karen's lead voice that made them so recognizable.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=48}} Record executive [[Mike Curb]] said it was Karen's voice that took the Carpenters above straight pop music into [[pop rock]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=296}} She was known as a "one take wonder" and could deliver a strong performance on the first attempt.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.voicecouncil.com/what-singers-can-learn-from-karen-carpenter/|title=What Singers Can Learn From Karen Carpenter|journal=Voice Council Magazine|date=June 15, 2016|access-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006012712/http://www.voicecouncil.com/what-singers-can-learn-from-karen-carpenter/|archive-date=October 6, 2017}}</ref>

Karen was an accomplished drummer, which was her original musical role, but she soon began to sing for the group too. Before 1974, Karen played the drums for a number of their songs, although some had Hal Blaine playing.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=58}} Blaine later reported that while Karen was a capable drummer he was brought in for studio work partly because Karen was accustomed to playing loudly for live audiences and thus was unfamiliar with the more subtle playing required in recording facilities of the era.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/hal-blaine-on-karen-carpenter.php?width=1440 |title = Jazz news: Hal Blaine on Karen Carpenter}}</ref> She considered herself a "drummer who sang".<ref name=allen>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/aug/02/the-carpenters-10-of-the-best|title=The Carpenters – 10 of the best|first=Jeremy|last=Allen|newspaper=The Guardian|date=August 2, 2017|access-date=October 2, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220733/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2017/aug/02/the-carpenters-10-of-the-best|archive-date=September 11, 2017}}</ref> However, while Karen's vocals soon became the centerpiece of the group's performances, at {{Convert|5|ft|4|in|abbr=on}} tall, performing behind her drum kit made it difficult for audiences to see her and it was soon apparent to Richard and their manager that the audience wanted to see more of Karen. Although unwilling, she eventually agreed to sing the ballads standing up front, returning to her drums for the lesser known songs.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=111}}

As the group's popularity increased, demand for Karen's vocals at the expense of her drumming overshadowed her abilities and gradually, she played the drums less; for ''A Kind of Hush'', she played no drums at the sessions at all,<ref name="akindofhush">{{cite AV media notes |title= A Kind of Hush|others= The Carpenters|year= 1976|first= Richard|last= Carpenter|publisher= A&M Records}}</ref> although she continued to sporadically drum in concert. From early 1976 onward, the tours featured a drum medley for Karen, and a piano solo number for Richard.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=158}} Karen made a final return to studio drumming for the track "When It's Gone (It's Just Gone)" on ''Made in America'', albeit in tandem with Nashville session drummer [[Larrie Londin]], and she also provided percussion in tandem with [[Paulinho da Costa]] on "Those Good Old Dreams".<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Made In America|publisher=A&M Records|id=SP-3723|year=1981}}</ref> Karen used Ludwig drums, [[Zildjian cymbals]], a [[Rogers Drums|Rogers]] foot pedal and hi-hat stand, 11A drumsticks and [[Remo]] drumheads.<ref name="officialfansaskarchive"/>

== Promotion and touring ==
Although the Carpenters' greatest success was with record sales, most of their professional career was spent on the road. Albums took between four and five months to produce; the remainder of time would be spent at live concerts and television appearances. The duo played up to six one-night concerts back-to-back, which left them exhausted,{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=121}} along with television shows including ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'', ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' and ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|The Johnny Cash Show]]'', as well as their own television specials.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=314}}

The Carpenters played numerous concerts from 1971 to 1975:{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=137}}

From the mid-1970s onwards, the Carpenters changed their stage show to allow Karen to have more presence and to interact with the audience, particularly between instrumental breaks.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=134}} However, extensive touring and lengthy recording sessions had begun to take their toll on the duo and contributed to their professional and personal difficulties during the latter half of the decade. Karen dieted obsessively and developed anorexia nervosa, which first manifested itself in 1975 when the duo was forced to cancel concert tours in the [[Philippines]], UK and Japan.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=144}} Richard has said that he regrets the six- and seven-day work schedules of that period, adding that had he known then what he knows now, he would not have agreed to it, and was persuaded to do so by the belief that the Carpenters would not be financially stable without the touring.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=124}} Richard's Quaalude addiction began to affect his performance in the late 1970s and led to the end of the duo's live concert appearances in 1978.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=183–84}}

Despite numerous concert appearances, the Carpenters never released a [[live album]] in the US. Two such albums, ''[[Live in Japan (The Carpenters album)|Live in Japan]]'' (1974) and ''[[Live at the Palladium (The Carpenters album)|Live at the Palladium]]'' (1976) have been released in Japan and reissued on CD there. Richard has said he is not particularly interested in live albums.<ref name="officialfansaskarchive"/>

The Carpenters' popularity confounded critics. With their output focused on ballads and mid-tempo pop, the duo's music was sometimes dismissed as being bland and saccharine. The recording industry, however, bestowed awards on the duo, who won three Grammy Awards during their career ([[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo, Group, or Chorus]], for "(They Long to Be) Close to You" in 1970;{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=95}} and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group for ''Carpenters'' in 1971).{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=108}} In 1974, the Carpenters were voted Favorite Pop/Rock Band, Duo, or Group at the first annual [[American Music Award]]s.<ref name="ama1974">{{cite web |url=http://www.theamas.com/winners-database/?winnerKeyword=&winnerYear=1974&winnerCategory= |title=American Music Awards of 1974 |access-date=June 13, 2016 |website=www.theamas.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011142826/https://www.theamas.com/winners-database/?winnerKeyword=&winnerYear=1974&winnerCategory= |archive-date=October 11, 2017 }}</ref>

From the start of their career, the Carpenters were coached by their management over handling interviews, and told to avoid saying anything controversial that would spoil their "clean cut" image.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=105}} A&M described the duo as "Real nice American kids – in 1971".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=106}}{{sfn|Lott|2008|pp=220–21}} While the Carpenters were not a rock band, they were reviewed by the rock press; in 1971, ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Lester Bangs]] described them as having "the most disconcerting collective stage presence of any band I have seen". He also said that promotional photographs made them resemble "the cheery innocence of some years-past dream of California youth", and they appeared to the public to be more conservative than they actually were.{{efn|Both Richard and Karen believed [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] should be legal.<ref name=act/>}} The White House appearances only served to reinforce this image.<ref name=act>{{cite journal|url=http://people.com/archive/cover-story-brother-sister-act-vol-6-no-5/|title=Brother & Sister Act|author=Windeler, Robert|journal=People|date=August 2, 1976|access-date=October 5, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005202824/http://people.com/archive/cover-story-brother-sister-act-vol-6-no-5/|archive-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref>{{sfn|Lott|2008|pp=220–21}}{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|pp=106–07}}

Though the Carpenters had mass popular appeal and were recognized as being musically talented, people felt embarrassed and stigmatized about liking their records.{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=108}} In later interviews, Richard stressed repeatedly how much he disliked the A&M executives for making their image "squeaky-clean", and the critics for criticizing them for their image rather than their music.{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=109}}
{{quote|I got upset when this whole "squeaky clean" thing was tagged on to us. I never thought about ''standing'' for anything! They [the critics] took "Close to You" and said: "Aha, you see that number one? THAT's for the people who believe in apple pie! THAT's for people who believe in the American flag! THAT's for the average middle-American person and his station wagon! The Carpenters stand for that, and I'm taking them to my bosom!" And boom, we got tagged with that label.''{{sfn|Coleman|1994|p=109}}}}

After "Goodbye to Love" had been released, attitudes towards the duo changed slightly. Ken Barnes, writing in [[Phonograph Record (magazine)|''Phonograph'']] said "It's certainly less than revolutionary to admit you like the Carpenters these days – in 'rock' circles, if you recall, it formerly bordered on heresy. Everybody must be won over by now."<ref name=allen/> Since then, the group's "saccharine" image has softened and musicians have cited the Carpenters as a key influence.<ref name=rs>{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-carpenters/biography|title=The Carpenters Bio|journal=Rolling Stone|year=2001|access-date=October 4, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005000310/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-carpenters/biography|archive-date=October 5, 2017}}</ref> In 1995, ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s Sue Cummings wrote that the 1990s acceptance of the duo's work was "a renewed ironic appreciation", adding that listeners "had loved the veneer, then hated it, then found it even more compelling, on a second look, for the complexity in the places where the darkness cracked through".{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=295}}

Shortly after Karen's death, a film archivist discovered some rare footage of an early Carpenters' television appearance. The archivist contacted Richard Carpenter and the two began viewing more footage which he had found. When the British division of A&M Records learned of the discoveries, they suggested the footage be turned into a video for home viewing. The finished piece, entitled "Yesterday Once More" is 55 minutes long and combines vintage and recent film clips. A&M Video and Richard intended "to create a video that played like an album"; all music was remixed from the masters and each selection was put into correct [[synchronization]]. The video was released in early 1985.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/cashbox47unse_46#page/36/mode/2up/search/karen+carpenter|title=A&M Video Releases Carpenters' Video History|date=May 11, 1985|page=36|journal=Cash Box|issn=0008-7289|access-date=October 10, 2017}}</ref>

Pop singer [[Michael Jackson]] was a fan of the duo, being one of his favourite bands.

A critical re-evaluation of the Carpenters occurred during the 1990s and 2000s with the making of several documentaries such as ''[[Close to You: Remembering The Carpenters]]'' (US), ''The Sayonara'' (Japan), and ''[[Only Yesterday: The Carpenters Story]]'' (UK). Despite contentions that their sound was "too soft" to fall under the definition of rock and roll, major campaigns and petitions exist toward inducting the Carpenters into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].{{sfn|Schmidt|2010|p=296}}
