'''Front 242''' is a Belgian [[electronic music]] group that came into prominence during the 1980s. Pioneering the style they called [[electronic body music]], they are a profound influence on the [[Electronic music|electronic]] and [[Industrial music|industrial]] music genres.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/front-242-p13004/biography |title=Front 242 |website=AllMusic |access-date=2012-05-13}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
Front 242 were formed in 1981 in [[Aarschot]], near [[Leuven]], Belgium, by Daniel Bressanutti and Dirk Bergen, who wanted to create music and graphic design using emerging electronic tools. Prior to forming Front 242, Bressanutti worked on a music project called '''Prothese''' that had already produced several one-off tracks.<ref name="assimilate">{{cite book |last1=Reed |first1=S.

Patrick Codenys and [[Jean-Luc De Meyer]] had separately formed a group called '''Underviewer''' at around the same time. The groups merged in 1982 after Underviewer had given their demo tapes to Bressanutti who was working at a music instruments shop at the time (Hill's Music in Brussels.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 1:45</ref>) Daniel was so impressed he asked Patrick and Jean-Luc to join Front 242.<ref name="assimilate" />

Recordings by the band were initially created in Daniel's apartment studio, where all the entire band and their equipment were packed into a 2.5m x 2.5m room.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 4:10 & 13:40</ref> The band incorporated as an artistic association in Belgium which allowed them to access government assistance and made it easier to afford better studio equipment.<ref name="keyboard_sep_89">{{cite journal |last1=Doerschuk |first1=Robert L. |editor1-last=Milano |editor1-first=Dominic |title=Front 242: The Aggressive Edge of Rhythm & The Power of Recycled Culture |journal=Keyboard |date=Sep 1989 |volume=15 |issue=8 |pages=50–57 |publisher=Miller Freeman Publications |location=Cupertino, CA |language=en|issn=0730-0158}}</ref>

Bressanutti, Codenys and De Meyer took turns on vocals at first, until they settled on De Meyer as the lead vocalist (early recordings with Bressanutti on vocals were subsequently released in 2004). De Meyer came to write most of the lyrics, although Valerie Jane Steele wrote several tracks including "Don't Crash." Despite falling into specific roles, however, the band sought to project a more anonymous, mysterious image, replete with dark sunglasses and militaristic uniforms so that they could not be easily identified.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 11:50</ref> Bressanutti took this anonymity to the extreme, leaving stage entirely to run live shows from the sound board behind the audience.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 45:55</ref>

The band self-released their first album, ''Geography'', in 1982<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 14:02</ref> and shortly after signed to the Belgian indie label consortium [[Les Disques du Crépuscule]] who later re-released the album.<ref name="assimilate" /> Their next single, "U-Men", was released the same year as was the band's first music video, produced by [[Marcel Vanthilt]] and played on the program RoodVonk on [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|VRT (Vlaamse Radio Televisie - Flemish Radio & TV)]]. The video proved a challenge, not only conceptually given the band's insistence on anonymity, but because of the small budget; ultimately the video was shot on location in Daniel's bedroom.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 15:10</ref>

In 1983, the band brought on [[Richard Jonckheere]] (a.k.a.: Richard 23), who they became familiar with through Richard's own "noise concept," as a percussionist and second vocalist to help boost the band's live presence.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 5:37</ref> Not long after, Dirk Bergen left the band to manage the group and pursue a graphic design career.<ref name="assimilate" /> Also in 1983 the band released the EP ''Endless Riddance''.

===Rising popularity===
Front 242 became a popular musical group in Belgium, particularly for their "infamous" live performances that involved loud sound, aggressive stage presence, smoke, and bright flashing lights.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 16:40</ref> The music press in Belgium was less receptive, sometimes interpreting their militaristic appearance, dark music, and samples from war movies - especially given the backdrop of the Cold War and [[Communist Combatant Cells|terror incidents]] in Belgium - as being pro-fascist, an interpretation that the band firmly rejected.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 19:50</ref>

Their second album, ''[[No Comment (Front 242 album)|No Comment]]'', released in 1984,<ref name="history"/> was the first to introduce the term [[electronic body music]] in association with their sound via the liner notes, which stated: "Electronic body music composed and produced on eight tracks by Front 242."<ref name="assimilate" /> The band followed the release with a European tour.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 23:50</ref>

It was around this time that Front 242 had some collaborations with [[Luc van Acker]], who was a familiar presence at Hill's Music. On one occasion, Luc brought his guitar and gear to the band's studio where samples of the session were used in composing the track "No Shuffle." Luc was also known to take the stage with the band at times.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 29:30</ref>

Front 242 signed with the American label [[Wax Trax|Wax Trax!]] in 1984. At the behest of [[Alain Jourgensen]] who was working with Wax Trax at the time, Front 242 was invited to be the support band for [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] during their upcoming tour in the United States. This tour led to the creation of [[Revolting Cocks]] by Richard 23, Luc van Acker, and Alain Jourgensen.<ref name="lost-gospels">{{cite book |last1=Jourgensen |first1=Al |last2=Wiederhorn |first2=Jon|title=Ministry: The Lost Gospels According to Al Jourgensen |publisher=Da Capo |isbn=9780306822902 |url=https://archive.org/details/ministrylostgosp00jour |url-access=registration |year=2013 |pages=75–76}}</ref>

In 1985 the band played the Seaside Festival and the first ever [[Pukkelpop|Pukkelpop Festival]] in Belgium. An incident between the band and security at Pukkelpop resulted in more poor reflections and accusations in the press.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 32:00</ref> That year they also released the ''Politics of Pressure'' EP and a 12" for "No Shuffle."

In 1986, Front 242 turned down a contract with [[ZTT Records]] and instead signed with the [[Red Rhino]] (RRE) label in Europe<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 34:45</ref> - a sub-label of [[PIAS Recordings|Play It Again Sam]] - who released ''Backcatalogue'' and ''Official Version'' in 1987.<ref name="history"/> Trouser Press credited ''Official Version'' with helping Front 242 "emerge from relative obscurity to become a significant cult force, selling records all over the world."<ref name="trouser-press">{{cite web |last1=Fletcher |first1=Tony |last2=Frampton |first2=Megan |title=Front 242 |url=https://trouserpress.com/reviews/front-242/ |website=Trouser Press |access-date=10 May 2021}}</ref> In the fall of 1987, Front 242 supported [[Depeche Mode]] on the first European leg of their ''[[Music for the Masses]]'' tour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Support acts - Depeche Mode Live Wiki|url=https://dmlive.wiki/wiki/Support_acts|access-date=2020-09-16|website=dmlive.wiki}}</ref>

In 1988, ''[[Front by Front]]'' was released, and in December of that same year, "[[Headhunter (song)|Headhunter]]" (with a video by [[Anton Corbijn]]),<ref name="history"/> became the band's first club hit, reaching number 13 on the [[United States|US]] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Dance/Club Play Songs]] [[record chart|chart]].<ref name="billboard singles">{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=front 242|chart=Dance/Club Play Songs}} | title=Front 242 Chart History: Singles | work=billboard.com | publisher=Nielsen Media Inc. | access-date=March 25, 2010}}</ref>

===1990s===
''[[Tyranny (For You)]]'', released in 1991, became the band's highest-charting album, reaching #95 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="billboard 200">{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=front 242|chart=Billboard 200}} | title=Front 242 Album & Song Chart History: Billboard 200 | work=billboard.com | publisher=Nielsen Media Inc. | access-date=March 25, 2010}}</ref>  ''Tyranny (For You)'' was the first album they released under contract with a major corporate label, Sony/Epic,<ref name="history"/> after the widespread popularity of ''Front by Front''. Sony/Epic also acquired the rights to the band's back catalog from Wax Trax! and issued re-released versions of the albums with new cover art and bonus tracks taken from singles and EPs.<ref name="history"/>

In 1992, Bressanutti returned to combining graphic arts with music, taking his lithographs on tour to three U.S. galleries. Bressanutti also composed a solo half-hour atmospheric recording called ''Art and Strategy'' (or The Art Corporation) to play during viewings of the lithographs, and released it in a limited edition of 1,000 CDs.

Front 242's style shifted abruptly with each of their next two albums, released in rapid succession in 1993 on Epic's sub-label RRE (originally planned as a double-CD):  ''06:21:03:11 UP EVIL'' and ''05:22:09:12 OFF'' (the numbers correspond to letters, spelling "FUCK UP EVIL" and "EVIL OFF"). The band describes the two albums as "based on the duality of good and evil."<ref name="history"/>  However, strains were emerging, with the band members apparently having different artistic views. Despite these tensions, they performed on the main stage of the 1993 [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref>{{cite book | author=Garofalo, Reebee | title=Rockin' Out: Popular Music in the USA | publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall | year=2008 | page=[https://archive.org/details/rockinoutpopular0000garo/page/421 421] | isbn=978-0-13-234305-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/rockinoutpopular0000garo/page/421 }}</ref>

Neither of these albums had significant input from Richard 23, and ''05:22:09:12 OFF'' only included their lead vocalist, Jean-Luc De Meyer, on a remixed track originally from ''Up Evil''. On the other hand, a variety of new contributors were listed as members of Front 242 on these albums: Jean-Marc Pauly and Pierre Pauly (of the Belgian electronic group Parade Ground) on ''Up Evil'', and 99 Kowalski, Jon Dubs and Eran Westwood on ''Off''.<ref>{{cite book | title=The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll | author=Romanowski, Patricia | year=1995 | publisher=Fireside | isbn=978-0-684-81044-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonee00patr }}</ref>

99 Kowalski is the stage name of Kristin Kowalski, making a tradition out of Richard 23's idea of number-as-name. Kowalski, Dubs and Westwood were originally members of a [[New York City]] band called Spill who Bressanutti and Codenys had brought to Belgium to produce their debut album. After the recording sessions fell apart, they contributed to Front 242 on the ''Off'' release.

After the release of ''06:21:03:11 Up Evil'' and ''05:22:09:12 Off'', there was no new material from Front 242 under any lineup. Instead, the band released a stream of live recordings and remixes. However, this period also saw a proliferation of side projects, an inordinate number of which involved De Meyer.

Earlier, Richard 23 played in the [[Revolting Cocks]], and De Meyer had a side project doing vocals for [[Bigod 20]] for their single, "The Bog" in 1990. In 1995, De Meyer met [[Marc Heal]] of [[Cubanate]] at a [[Front Line Assembly]] concert, and the two of them collaborated along with [[Ged Denton]] and Jonathan Sharp, to record as [[Cyber-Tec Project]] for the new (and short-lived) Cyber-Tec record label.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&q=%22richard+23%22+%22up+evil%22&pg=PA377 | author=Thompson, Dave | title=Alternative Rock | page=377 | publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation | year=2000 | isbn=9780879306076 | access-date=April 14, 2011}}</ref>

After the departure of Sharp and the demise of the Cyber-Tec label, the remaining group continued working under the name [[C-Tec]]. De Meyer also took over as vocalist for [[Birmingham 6 (band)|Birmingham 6]] for their 1996 album ''Error of Judgment''. 1996 also saw the debut album ''Elemental'' from [[Cobalt 60 (band)|Cobalt 60]], which De Meyer formed with [[Dominique Lallement]] and [[Frederic Sebastien]] of [[Reims]], France, members of [[Kriegbereit]]. This was the start of a number of releases from Cobalt 60, which also did the soundtrack for the video game ''[[Wing Commander: Prophecy|Wing Commander V]]''.<ref name=nwdc/> Meanwhile, Richard 23 recorded with the groups [[Holy Gang]], and later, [[LaTchak]].

The four core members of Front 242 regrouped in 1998 to compose radically reworked versions of many of their songs, which they then performed on their first tour in five years, appropriately called the Re:Boot tour. They acknowledged the influence of [[The Prodigy]] and their ''Fat of the Land'' album in crafting the new, more techno style of Re:Boot.

The new tour material was the subject of Front 242's new recording contract in the U.S. with [[Metropolis Records]]. Front 242 also indicated at this time that they were recording new material. However, they had little activity after 1998, making occasional appearances in Europe and Mexico, while Codenys recorded under the name [[Gaiden]] with [[Steve Stoll (musician)|Steve Stoll]] in 2001.

===2000s===
2002 saw the beginning of a wave of new material from Bresanutti and Codenys, and then from Front 242. In August 2002 a DVD/CD two-disc set called ''Speed Tribe'' was released by Dance.com. The DVD was a collaboration with experimental documentary filmmakers Rod Chong and Sharon Matarazzo, who filmed the 2001 24 Hour Le Mans. In the video, the racecars, clouds, rain and spectators form an impressionistic visual backdrop for the music.

Several months later, the first release from Male or Female, also known as Morf, a new project for Bresanutti and Codenys along with vocalist Elko Blijweert. In 2002 and 2003, Morf released an album, an E.P., a double album, and a DVD/CD two-disc combo, on the Belgian record label [[Alfa Matrix]], and went on tour through the U.S.

Then, 2002 and 2003 also saw the release of the new material from Front 242 in a decade: the EP ''[[Pulse (Front 242 album)#Still & Raw EP|Still & Raw]]'' and the album ''[[Pulse (Front 242 album)|Pulse]]'', released on XIIIBis Records in Europe and Metropolis in the U.S. These represented another iteration of Front 242's explicitly stated goal of reinventing itself. The style of the two new releases is more mellow than some of their past work, using more "glitchy" and "bleepy" sounds. As well, it uses the manipulated voice as a musical instrument. The new releases have a much more emotional style from De Meyer, which was presaged in his later recordings with [[C-Tec]] and particularly [[Cobalt 60 (band)|Cobalt 60]] on its album ''Twelve''.

Front 242 promised a new U.S. tour to perform new material from these releases. They have made occasional appearances in Latin America and Europe, even being rejoined by Dirk Bergen for a reunion concert in Aarschot (De Klinker club) in 2004 under the original lineup of Bresanutti, Bergen, Codenys and De Meyer. This performance was kept secret until two days before the show but when the scene magazine [[Side-Line]] and the band's label [[Alfa Matrix]] launched the news, tickets were quickly sold out.

The band has now also set itself to re-release its entire back catalogue both as a normal CD and as a limited edition consisting of a 2-CD set holding previously unreleased material. For this the band is working together with the Belgian label [[Alfa Matrix]] that already took care of releasing the albums of the Front 242 side-project Male Or Female. The first re-release is their debut album ''Geography'', this time newly remastered personally by Bresanutti to surprisingly powerful effect and including 3 extra tracks (two hidden ones) on the normal CD format.

Meanwhile, their enthusiasm for side projects has continued, as Patrick Codenys started appearing with a new group called [[Red Sniper]], Bresanutti started recording with a new group called Troissoeur, and Codenys and Richard 23 formed a quasi-DJ project called [[Coder23]] which toured in late 2004 and early 2005 as the opening act for [[VNV Nation]]. De Meyer contributed vocals on two studio tracks for the [[Glis]] album ''Nemesis'' in 2005. The lyrical content of the two songs ("The Irreparable" and "La Béatrice") were based on the poems of [[Charles Baudelaire]].

Front 242 toured through twenty venues in North America in November 2005, their first tour as a full band since 2000. The band performed at the [[Roskilde Festival]] in 2006. The band's sold out two-day performance at the Ancienne Belgique in Brussels has been recorded for a future release via [[Alfa Matrix]].

In December 2006, Front 242 announced from their MySpace page that they were writing music for a video game called ''[[Cipher Complex]]'' and provided a link to a teaser trailer with a short sample of one of their scores.

In 2007, De Meyer announced a new project: 32CRASH via the Alfa Matrix label. The band is preparing for an album release in October 2007 after the release of the EP ''Humanity''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25639_0_2_0_C |title=32CRASH announces pre-sales debut album |date=4 Sep 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165505/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=25639_0_2_0_C |archive-date=30 Sep 2007 }}</ref>

In August 2008, Front 242 played live at the [[Infest (festival)|Infest Festival]] in Bradford, England.

In October 2008, Front 242 performed for the first time in Finland, at the [[Alternative Party (demo party)|Alternative Party 2008]] media arts festival.

===2008–present===
In 2008, the band added two new members: Tim Kroker on percussion and Sylvain Guigon on live video projection and effects.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 4:51</ref>

On June 1, 2008, the Alfa Matrix label announced that Front 242 would make an ultimate statement towards abusive audio compression by releasing the free two-track download, ''First Moment''. By June 15 the same year, the tracks were made available for free on Alfa Matrix's site in medium and high bit-rate [[MP3]]s, [[WAV]], [[FLAC]], and [[MPEG-4 Part 14#.MP4 versus .M4A|M4A]] formats.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alfa-matrix.com/shop_comments.php?id=1524_0_8_0_C |title=Front 242 – "First moment" free 2-track download |date=15 Jun 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080606013052/http://www.alfa-matrix.com/shop_comments.php?id=1524_0_8_0_C |archive-date=6 Jun 2008 }}</ref> Contrary to what fans and some media speculated, the two-track download was not new studio material. Instead, ''First Moments'' consisted of two previously unreleased live tracks, "U-Men" and "Im Rhythmus Bleiben", in rather stunning sound quality. It is rumored that over 20,000 people downloaded the tracks within hours of being made available.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The label later confirmed that over 25,000 people downloaded the free tracks.

On June 4, 2008, Alfa Matrix announced the release of ''Moments...'' The album was a live recording encompassing the best of Front 242's compositions. The album was shipped in several formats including limited CD box sets, vinyl in different colors including 300-copy limited editions, and as a one-disc CD release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alfa-matrix.com/shop_comments.php?id=1545_0_8_0_C |title=Front 242 – "Moments..." digipak CD + Limited 2CD Carton Box + "Kommando" t-shirt |date=5 Sep 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707053245/http://www.alfa-matrix.com/shop_comments.php?id=1545_0_8_0_C |archive-date=7 Jul 2008 }}</ref>

On April 15, 2016, Alfa Matrix released the remastered edition of P.U.L.S.E. The re-release featured the companion Still+Raw EP, in multicolored two-disc CD formats with the special collector box set limited to 1242 copies; this box set included the album in vinyl and CD formats, as well as a 1989 live recording, a laminated live pass, posters, and the Alfa Matrix Sounds from the Matrix 017 compilation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Front 242 issues remastered edition of last studio album |url=http://regenmag.com/news/front-242-issues-remastered-edition-of-last-studio-album/ |website=ReGen Magazine |access-date=21 March 2019 |date=15 April 2016}}</ref>

While Front 242 have not released new music since [[Pulse (Front 242 album)|''Pulse'']] in 2003, on the "Black To Square One" US Tour they played three 'new' songs: "Generator", "Fix It", and "Deeply Asleep." There is no information on whether these songs or a new studio album will see a release.

==Influences and style==
Bressanutti cites [[Musique concrète|Musique Concrète]], [[Avant-garde music|Avant Garde]], and the experimental music of [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] as early influences.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 3:15</ref> De Meyer cited [[Joy Division]] as an early influence for their "dramatic content."<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 2:45</ref> The electro-pop style of [[Fad Gadget]] also provided early inspiration for the band.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 3:34</ref> While they were aware of, enjoyed, and learned from musical progenitors such as [[Klaus Schulze]], [[Kraftwerk]], and fellow countrymen [[Telex]], the band did not see their styles as particularly influential.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 8:28</ref> When asked in a 1989 interview about Front 242's being grouped with other industrial bands, Codenys replied that they "were somewhere in between Throbbing Gristle, Kraftwerk, and bands like that, but... wanted to be exclusive, and to have nothing to do with any fashion."<ref name="keyboard_sep_89" />

Despite the stated intention of remaining genre-neutral, Front 242 did latch onto a phrase to describe their style: "electronic body music" or EBM; a phrase that would expand into a genre in itself. The band was not the first to use "electronic body music" as a music descriptor. Kraftwerk used the phrase to describe their 1978 album ''Die Mensch Maschine'' (translated: The Man-Machine) and the German group [[Deutsch Amerikanische Freundschaft]] (DAF) used a similar term - "körpermusik" - to describe their music at the beginning of the 1980s.<ref name="RA_ebm">{{cite web |last1=Dicker |first1=Holly |title=Join in the chant: Inside the cult of EBM |url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/3311 |website=[[Resident Advisor]] |access-date=25 September 2020 |date=21 Aug 2018}}</ref> Despite not having coined the term originally, Front 242 was the first to explicitly claim EBM as a descriptor on the liner notes of their 1984 album ''No Comment'' and cemented their claim to the genre when given the lead track on the seminal [[PIAS Recordings|Play It Again Sam]] compilation ''This Is Electronic Body Music'' in 1988.<ref name="assimilate" />


==Legacy and cultural influence==

In the 80s, Front 242 strived to project a visual mystery and anonymity to accompany their aggressive physical stage performances. The band's ethic is largely responsible for defining the "[[Rivethead]]" style of industrial and EBM culture which included the wearing of military gear, such as flak jackets, camouflage, and combat boots, as well as hairstyles, sunglasses, accessories, tattoos, and piercings.<ref name="woods_2007">{{cite thesis |last=Woods |first=Bret D. |date=6 Jun 2007 |title=Industrial Music for Industrial People: The History and Development of an Underground Genre |degree=Masters |publisher=Florida State University |url=http://purl.flvc.org/fsu/fd/FSU_migr_etd-0781 |access-date=22 Sep 2020}}</ref>

During the 1991 [[Gulf War]], US Navy ships continuously played a list of songs by Front 242 and other bands such as the Ramones, The Clash, and Ministry as a means of boosting morale and aggression during combat operations. The band were informed of this by military personnel who attended their 1993 tour.<ref>Canvas (2008) Event occurs at 41:10</ref>

A broader public was exposed to Front 242's music in 1992 in the film ''[[Single White Female]]'', starring [[Bridget Fonda]] and [[Jennifer Jason Leigh]]. In the film, obsessed roommate Leigh ties Fonda to a chair but leaves her with the television remote control. In order to attract attention, Fonda tunes in to a music video channel and turns up the volume. The video playing at the time is Front 242's "Rhythm Of Time",<ref name=nwdc>{{cite web | url=http://members.fortunecity.com/twins242/front242/interviews/d_phillips.html | title=Front 242 – Interview | author=Phillips, D. | work=New World Destruction Channel | date=October 1997 | access-date=April 14, 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308185145/http://members.fortunecity.com/twins242/front242/interviews/d_phillips.html | archive-date=March 8, 2012 }}</ref> from the album ''Tyranny (For You)''. Also in 1992, the television commercials for the film ''[[K2 (film)|K2]]'' were set to the Front 242 song "Moldavia", from the same album.

In 1997 Billboard Encyclopedia featured Front 242 in their "Top 500 Best Producers in Rock History."<ref name="chain_dlk_speedtribe">{{cite web |last1=Urselli |first1=Marc |title=Interview: SpeedTribe |url=https://www.chaindlk.com/interviews/SpeedTribe/ |website=Chain D.L.K. |access-date=23 September 2020 |date=1 Jun 2002}}</ref>
