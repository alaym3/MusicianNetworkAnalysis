==History==
Dubuc was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He speaks [[Spanish language|Spanish]] fluently, but in an interview he said "I didn't want people to think I was a Latin singer like [[Enrique Iglesias]]. Not because those people are bad, because they make great music. But I didn't want anyone to get the wrong idea. I wanted a nondescriptive band's name so that the music can speak for itself."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/ent/stories/DN-secrethandshake_0420gd.ART.State.Edition1.4a91f5f.html|title=Secret Handshake's Luis Dubuc likes that his stage name doesn't tell you much|last=Tarradell|first=Mario|date=2009-04-20|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]|publisher=Vibe Media Group|access-date=2010-10-20}}</ref>

=== Thirty Called Arson and The Secret Handshake (2004–2011) ===
[[File:The Secret Handshake 2010.jpg|thumb|220px|Dubuc performing as The Secret Handshake on July 16, 2010]]
Dubuc first got his start playing drums in a couple of bands with his friends, most notably in the hardcore unit Thirty Called Arson.<ref name="Apar">{{cite web|last=Apar |first=Corey |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p856204/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Secret Handshake |publisher=allmusic |access-date=2010-06-06}}</ref> Inspired by artists like [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Daft Punk]], he eventually began writing and recording some songs as a side project in his Dallas-based bedroom with a laptop and [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer]] to assist him.<ref name="Apar"/> By November 2004, Dubuc had self-released his first full-length album, entitled ''Antarctica''. Less than a year later, he followed up with the EP ''This Is Bigger Than You and I'', which was issued through Doll House Recordings. Momentum began building around his distinctive electronica laptop pop/rock, and The Secret Handshake developed a devoted fanbase. Another EP, ''Summer of '98'' (referring to the summer before he started high school),<ref name="Apar"/> was released in early 2007 through New York's [[Triple Crown Records]],<ref>{{cite web | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p856204/discography|pure_url=yes}} | title = The Secret Handshake discography | access-date = 18 March 2009 | publisher = [[Allmusic]]}}</ref> anchored by the vocoder-heavy title track. The full length ''[[One Full Year]]'' followed, becoming his full length [[Triple Crown Records]] debut.

In 2008 The Secret Handshake was featured on the [[Punk Goes Crunk]] compilation/covers album, where he covered [[Skee-Lo]]'s rap classic "[[I Wish (Skee-Lo song)|I Wish]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Mueller |first=Chelsea |url=http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2008/04/notes_punk_goes_crunk_handshak.php |title=Notes: Punk Goes Crunk, Handshakes and Highfives on iTunes - Dallas Music - DC9 At Night |publisher=Blogs.dallasobserver.com |date=2008-04-09 |access-date=2010-06-06}}</ref>

On April 29, 2009, The Secret Handshake released his third studio album, ''[[My Name Up in Lights]]''. The album was recorded entirely in Dubuc's apartment in Dallas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2009-04-23/music/the-secret-handshake/|title=The Secret Handshake - My Name Up in Lights (Triple Crown)|last=Freedman|first=Pete|date=2009-04-23|work=[[The Dallas Observer]]|publisher=Vibe Media Group|access-date=2010-10-20}}</ref> In 2009, the album reached #17 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Heatseekers chart<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/heatseekers-albums|title=Heatseekers Albums: Up and Coming Musicians Chart|website=Billboard}}</ref> and #45 on the Independent Albums chart.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-05-09/independent-albums Charts], Billboard.com</ref>

The Secret Handshake opened for the ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' Tour 2009, entitled The Fall Ball, which also featured [[You Me At Six]], [[Set Your Goals (band)|Set Your Goals]], [[The Academy Is...]], and [[Mayday Parade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/archive_secrethandshakefallball/ |title=The Secret Handshake added to the AP Tour Fall Ball |publisher=AltPress.com |access-date=2010-06-06}}</ref> Luis Dubuc was featured on the subscriber-only cover of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' November 2009 issue, along with the lead singers of the other bands featured on The Fall Ball tour with a feature article.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://29.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_kqhxmySGyP1qzic9xo1_400.jpg |title=Picture |website=29.media.tumblr.com |format=JPG |access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>
The Secret Handshake toured in Australia from November 26 to December 6.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/tshaussietour.htm |title=// AP: NEWS - The Secret Handshake plan Australian tour |publisher=Altpress.com |access-date=2010-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001184911/http://www.altpress.com/news/tshaussietour.htm |archive-date=2012-10-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Secret Handshake finished a two-month tour in the summer of 2010 with [[Every Avenue]], [[Sing it Loud]], and [[There for Tomorrow]] on the [[Motel 6]] "Rock Yourself to Sleep" tour.<ref name="Hollywood Music Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://hollywoodmusicmagazine.com/whoshot/every-avenue-rock-yourself-to-sleep/|title=Every Avenue - "Rock Yourself To Sleep"|last=Smith|first=Raewyn|date=2010-07-12|work=Hollywood Music Magazine|publisher=Vibe Media Group|access-date=2010-10-20}}</ref>

The Secret Handshake's fourth studio album ''[[Night & Day (The Secret Handshake album)|Night & Day]]'' was released on August 17, 2010. ''Sound In The Signals'' complimented the new style found on the album, but criticized Dubuc's vocal ability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundinthesignals.tk/2010/08/secret-handshake-night-and-day-album.html |title=soundinthesignals.tk |publisher=soundinthesignals.tk |access-date=2019-05-12}}</ref>
''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' noted the new Motown sound was a risky move but stated that Dubuc "obviously had the skills to pull it off".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/reviews/the_secret_handshake_-_night_day/|title=The Secret Handshake - Night & Day|date=16 August 2010}}</ref>

Luis Dubuc was interviewed in the ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' October 2010 issue, in the feature article titled ''You Can Hurry Love''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/magazine/issue/267_-_the_state_of_the_scene/ |title=Alt Press: Magazine #267 (The State of the Scene)|publisher=AltPress.com |access-date=2010-09-07}}</ref>

=== Mystery Skulls (2011–present) ===
In 2011, Dubuc put The Secret Handshake to sleep and began to make music under the name Mystery Skulls.<ref>

In early 2018 Dubuc began airing live streams from his studio inviting fans to collaborate on his upcoming third album. Over the next several months he aired weekly videos on either YouTube or his Patreon. He released the first single from the forthcoming album "Don't F*ck With My Money" December 13, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LhSafEoC2I|title=Mystery Skulls - Don't F**k With My Money|last=Mystery Skulls|date=13 December 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref> The album "Back to Life" was officially released on April 12, 2019.

As Mystery Skulls, Dubuc has performed across the country and has held many shows, including a performance at [[Furry Weekend Atlanta]] in May 2019,<ref>{{cite tweet |user=FurryWeekendAtl |number=1096170972971974657 |date=February 14, 2019 |title=Ahoy mateys, the Mystery Guest is revealed!
