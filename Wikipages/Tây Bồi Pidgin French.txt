'''Tây Bồi''' ({{lang-vi|tiếng Tây bồi}}),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vietbao.com/a188903/ong-ho-viet-tieng-tay |title=Ông Hồ viết tiếng Tây |last=Trần |first=Khải |date=23 May 2012 |website= Việt Báo Online |access-date=19 June 2016}}</ref> or '''Vietnamese Pidgin French''', was a [[pidgin]] spoken by non-French-educated [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]], typically those who worked as servants in [[French Third Republic|French]] households or [[Social environment|milieu]]x during the [[French colonial empire|colonial era]]. Literally, it means "French (Tây) [of- or spoken by] male servants (Bồi)". During the [[French Indochina|French colonization period]], the majority of household servants for the French were male. The term is used by Vietnamese themselves to indicate that the spoken [[French language]] is poor, incorrect and ungrammatical.

{{lang|vi|Bồi}} is the Vietnamese phonetic spelling of the English word "boy", which referred to male household servants (it also means "to add" as a verb, which incidentally refers to how this pidgin worked).<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wG08AAAAIAAJ&q=tay+boi&pg=PA43|title=Pidginization and Creolization of Languages|author=John E.

The French government/colonizers or protectors opened French public schools (from pre-kindergarten through the Baccalaureat II) staffed by all native French speakers to take care of their compatriots/expatriates' children's education. Vietnamese children were admitted as well if they could pass the entrance examination tailored to their age and grade level. The Vietnamese elite class spoke French, and those with French Baccalaureat diplomas could attend French universities in France and in its colonies. After France's [[Geneva Conference (1954)|withdrawal from Indochina]] in 1954, Tây Bồi ceased to be used as a common language as standard French was used and is believed to have become extinct around the 1980s. Today standard French continues to be taught at schools and universities in Vietnam as a second language.
