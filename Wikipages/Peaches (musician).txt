== Career ==

=== 1990–99: Mermaid Cafe, ''Fancypants Hoodlum'', the Shit ===
During the early 1990s, Nisker was part of folk trio Mermaid Cafe. The name was taken from the [[Joni Mitchell]] song "[[Carey (song)|Carey]]".<ref>(2008-01-31). [http://www.thecanadianmusicforum.com/blog/?cat=27 Mermaid Cafe] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908095525/http://www.thecanadianmusicforum.com/blog/?cat=27 |date=8 September 2010 }} The Canadian Music Forum. Retrieved 16 April 2010.</ref> She later released her first solo album, ''[[Fancypants Hoodlum]]'', under the name Merrill Nisker in 1995, and subsequently developed the style and persona known as Peaches. In 1995, she started the Shit, a noisy four-piece combo with [[Gonzales (musician)|Chilly Gonzales]] (a.k.a. Jason Beck), bassist Sticky (later of [[Weeping Tile (band)|Weeping Tile]] and Music Maul), and Dominique Salole (a.k.a. [[Mocky]]). Their absurd, highly sexual rock music was a harbinger for what Nisker would become, as it was during this time that she adopted the Peaches name.<ref name="musicianguide.com" /> The Peaches moniker was taken from the [[Nina Simone]] song "[[Four Women (song)|Four Women]]" where Simone screams at the end, "My name is Peaches!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=52&csid2=778&fid1=2451 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120714161128/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=52&csid2=778&fid1=2451 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2012 |title=Exclaim!

=== 2000–02: ''The Teaches of Peaches'' ===
After creating a six-track EP, ''Lovertits'', Peaches moved to [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. While visiting her old friend Jason Beck, who was enjoying modest European success as [[Chilly Gonzales]] in his new home base of Berlin, Peaches landed a one-night gig. On the merits of that show alone, Berlin's [[Kitty-Yo]] label signed her on the spot. The label offered her the chance to record a new album, ''[[The Teaches of Peaches]]'', back home in Toronto, and the already-completed ''Lovertits'' EP was released in the summer of 2000. The full-length album ''The Teaches of Peaches'', was released that fall.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/peaches-biography| title= Peaches Biography: Contemporary Musicians| publisher= Enotes.com| access-date= 9 June 2010}}</ref> The album contains her signature song "[[Fuck the Pain Away]]".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Caroline |date=July 24, 2006 |title=Filth and fury |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/24/electronicmusic.urban |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |page=23 |access-date=October 25, 2014 }}</ref>

Peaches appeared on the British TV show ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', but her performance was deemed too racy to be aired.<ref name="SPIN">William V. Meter (23 June 2003). [https://www.spin.com/2003/06/peaches-shes-very-kinky-girl/ Peaches: She's a Very Kinky Girl] ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]''. Retrieved 2010-05-26.</ref>

Nisker signed to a European contract with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] following the release of ''[[The Teaches of Peaches]]''. She later made a big-budget video for the song "[[Set It Off (Peaches song)|Set It Off]]", in which she sat in a locker room as her pubic and armpit hair grew to [[Rapunzel]] length. [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]] subsequently dropped her. "Now they want their money back," Peaches said.<ref name="SPIN" />

In 2001, Nisker's 34AA bust was one of the first female busts cast by famous 1960s groupie [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]], who was better known for making molds of male rockers' genitalia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cynthiaplastercaster.com/html/list.html |title=Cynthia Plaster Caster |publisher=Cynthia Plaster Caster |access-date=9 June 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cynthiapcaster.org/casts/_breasts/breasts_peaches_page/peaches_page.htm |title=Cynthia P Caster |publisher=Cynthia P Caster Foundation |access-date=22 January 2011}}</ref>

In 2002, Peaches appeared in "Hideous Man", a short film directed by [[John Malkovich]]. The short was created as a showcase for clothing designed by [[Bella Freud]], and featured the poetry of [[Gary Sinise]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellafreud.co.uk/films/hideous-man-2/ |title=Hideous Man |website=Bellafreud.co.uk |access-date=21 January 2011}}</ref>

=== 2003–05: ''Fatherfucker'' ===
In 2003, Peaches released her second album ''[[Fatherfucker]]'' on [[XL Recordings|XL]]/[[Kitty-Yo]] after years of touring and opening for artists like [[Marilyn Manson]] and [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. She once again wrote and programmed all of the album's music herself. The single "[[Kick It (Peaches song)|Kick It]]", which features [[Iggy Pop]], was described by Peaches to Rolling Stone as "more about rock 'n' roll than sex."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/peaches/14090 |title=Pop Show! |publisher=Nme.Com |date=17 April 2003 |access-date=9 June 2010}}</ref>

Peaches has been noted for her stage costumes and flamboyant sense of style. Her looks are often both nostalgic and futuristic; aggressive and glamorous; and push the limits of gender identity. Peaches and her band Sweet Machine wear costumes from a variety of designers but most notably she works closely with stylist/designer Vaughan Alexander, celebrity hairstylist Charlie Le Mindu, and young American fashion designer, John Renaud.

In 2010, Peaches and backing band Sweet Machine once again toured Australia performing at the sold out [[Big Day Out]] festivals and at a series of sideshows. Peaches was supported on this tour by [[Shunda K]] who performed her collaboration "Billionaire" at BDO festivals and at the sideshows,<ref name="Shunda K" /> and was also the opening act at the sideshows along with [[Evil Beaver (band)|Evil Beaver]] in Melbourne.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In March 2010, the copyright owners of the musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' denied Peaches permission to perform her one-woman version that she was planning to stage in Berlin.

=== 2012: New music and ''Peaches Does Herself'' ===
It was announced in 2012 that a semi-biographical musical/concert film would be premièred at the Toronto Film Festival, utilising 22 songs from Peaches' back catalog and backed by her band the Sweet Machine.

''Peaches Does Herself'' premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival on 13 September 2012.

On 2 October 2012, Peaches released her new single "Burst!" as a digital single backed with several remixes.

=== 2015–present: ''What Else Is In the Teaches of Peaches'' and ''Rub'' ===
Photographer Holger Talinski collaborated with Peaches on a book of photographs, ''What Else Is In the Teaches of Peaches'', released on 2 June 2015. The book, published by Akashic Books, also includes text written by Peaches, [[R.E.M.]] lead singer [[Michael Stipe]], artist and singer [[Yoko Ono]] and actor [[Elliot Page]].

Peaches' sixth studio album, ''Rub'', was released 25 September 2015. It was produced by [[Vice Cooler]] with Peaches in her Los Angeles garage. In June 2015 it was announced to contain guest vocal appearances by [[Kim Gordon]], [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], and [[Simonne Jones]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/06/peaches-teams-with-feist-and-kim-gordon-for-new-album-rub/|title=Peaches teams with Feist and Kim Gordon for new album, Rub|date=23 June 2015|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref>

An unused track from the ''Rub'' sessions titled "Bodyline" was released by [[Adult Swim]] on 20 July 2015. The Vice Cooler-produced track features [[Nick Zinner]] on guitar and was described as "a heavy, chugging guitar line over which Peaches half raps, half sings a high-octane space jam."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/07/peaches-and-yeah-yeah-yeahs-nick-zinner-join-forces-for-bodyline-listen/|title=Peaches and Yeah Yeah Yeahs' Nick Zinner join forces for "Bodyline" — listen|date=20 July 2015|access-date=20 July 2015}}</ref> In May 2016, Peaches appeared in a fourth-season episode of the Canadian TV series ''[[Orphan Black]]'' as herself, performing "Bodyline" in a club. She performed "[[Boys Wanna Be Her]]" at the [[Not the White House Correspondents’ Dinner]] on 29 April 2017.  In February 2019, Peaches made her debut with the [[Staatstheater Stuttgart]], performing as Anna in Kurt Weill's [[The Seven Deadly Sins (ballet chanté)|Die sieben Todsünden]].

== Art ==
Peaches opened her first institutional solo art exhibition "Whose Jizz Is This?" at the Kunstverein in Hamburg on 9 August 2019 (through 20 October 2019)  Taking a bold and unexpected approach to the topics of sex, feminism, queerness, gender, and new millennium politics, Peaches calls her WJIT presentation "a deconstructed musical in 14 scenes." At the heart of this presentation are the "Fleshies," who have renamed themselves as such to rewrite their narrative, break away from humans and human interactions, do away with words like "sex toys" and "masturbators" in a quest to find sexual equality amongst themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kunstverein.de/ausstellungen/whose-jizz-is-this|title=Kunstverein in Hamburg|website=Kunstverein.de|access-date=20 October 2019}}</ref>

== Themes ==
[[Gender identity]] is one theme of Peaches' music, often playing with traditional notions of [[gender role]]s representation. Her lyrics and live shows consciously [[Genderfuck|blur]] the [[Gender binary|distinction]] between male and female; for example, she appears on the cover of her album ''[[Fatherfucker]]'' with a full beard. When asked if she had chosen the title for shock value, she commented:

{{blockquote|Motherfucker's so over. You call everybody a motherfucker - you call your mother a motherfucker. It's a pretty extreme and intense word. Instead of shying away from that, I thought I'd bring the fact that we're using the word motherfucker in a really mainstream way to the fore.<ref>{{cite news

She disputes accusations of "[[penis envy]]", preferring the term "hermaphrodite envy",<ref>"She tells interviewers she has hermaphrodite envy, not penis envy."

[[Ageing|Age]] has been another theme of Peaches' music in recent years. The lyrics from several songs from her 2009 album ''[[I Feel Cream]]'' tackle the issue of age, including "Trick or Treat" ("you lick my crow's feet"), "Show Stopper" ("Never mind my age, it's like we're breaking out of a cage") and "Mommy Complex". Peaches has criticized [[ageism]] directed against her,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princesssuperstar.com/press/features/urb_feat03.shtml |title=Urb Feature 2003 (with Peaches) |publisher=Princess Superstar |access-date=9 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060719203204/http://www.princesssuperstar.com/press/features/urb_feat03.shtml |archive-date=19 July 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> telling the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'' that "I'm going to make aging cool".<ref>{{cite web|author=Jim Farber |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music/2009/05/15/2009-05-15_rock_star_peaches_promises_to_make_aging_cool.html |title=Rock star Peaches promises to make aging cool |publisher=Nydailynews.com |date=14 May 2009 |access-date=9 June 2010}}</ref>
