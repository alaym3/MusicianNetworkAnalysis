In 1991 Ute Lemper participated in the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] with song ''The Photograph'', written by Italian songwriter [[Enzo Jannacci]].

A painter in the [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] style, Lemper's paintings have been showcased in numerous galleries.

''Unzensiert''. Berlin: Henschel, 1995. {{ISBN|978-3-89487-213-7}}</ref> She has also authored several journal articles.

===Film and television work===
She starred as [[Marie Antoinette]] for {{lang|fr|[[L'Autrichienne (film)|L'Autrichienne]]}} (1989, directed by [[Pierre Granier-Deferre]]), and subsequently appeared in films including ''[[Prorva (film)|Prorva]]'', ''[[Bogus (film)|Bogus]],'' ''{{ill|Jean Galmot|fr|Jean Galmot, aventurier}}'' ''[[Prospero's Books]],'' ''[[Appetite (film)|Appetite]]'' and {{lang|fr|[[Prêt-à-Porter (film)|Prêt-à-Porter]]}} (in the latter appearing in a well-publicised nude scene filmed while she was pregnant, and she received [[National Board of Review]] for Ensemble Cast award).

==Recording==
Lemper, named ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s'' Crossover Artist of the Year for 1993/1994, is a prolific recording artist, appearing on numerous [[cast recording]]s and compilation concerts, including [[Roger Waters]]' ''[[The Wall – Live in Berlin|The Wall]]'' concert in 1990.  As a solo artist, her extensive discography includes ubiquitously well-reviewed interpretations of [[Kurt Weill]]'s compositions from the late 1980s, in addition to German cabaret songs, which were very political songs sung in underground locations in 1930s Berlin and elsewhere. She recorded ''Illusions'' in 1992, devoted to the songs of Marlene Dietrich and [[Édith Piaf]].  She has numerous pop albums, variously in English, French, and German. ''[[Punishing Kiss]]'' (2000) featured songs written especially for her by the likes of [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Tom Waits]], [[Elvis Costello]], [[Philip Glass]], and [[Neil Hannon]], the latter of whom performed with her on two of the album's tracks.  Lemper is known for wild interpretations on discs like the Sondheim tribute ''City of Strangers'', containing a particularly mannered version of the [[Elaine Stritch]]-popularized song "[[The Ladies Who Lunch (song)|The Ladies Who Lunch]]".  In 1998, a Lemper compilation, ''[[All That Jazz: The Best of Ute Lemper]]'', was released. In 2003 and 2006, Lemper's songwriting talents were shown on her discs from those years as she moved from being an interpretive singer to a singer-songwriter.
