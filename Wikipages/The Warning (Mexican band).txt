== Lava Records Deal ==

On August 9, 2020, the band announced through their [[Patreon]] community that they had signed a  5 album record deal with American-based label [[Lava Records]] after 7 months of negotiation.

Work on their third studio album, produced by [[David Bendeth]], began in September 2020.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Warning 3rd Album Journey begins!|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bf7dyperM04|language=en|access-date=2021-10-11}}</ref>

The first single from the album, entitled "Choke," was released on May 21, 2021. On the day of release it reached the Top 50 of the main (all genre) [[iTunes]] charts in Ireland and Mexico and the Top 30 of the [[iTunes]] Rock Charts in US, UK, Ireland and Peru. The follow up single "Evolve" was released on July 23, 2021, and saw similar positive showings in the [[iTunes]] Rock Charts.

The band performed a new cover of "Enter Sandman" with [[Alessia Cara]] for ''[[The Metallica Blacklist]]'' album, a compilation of covers of songs from ''[[Metallica (album)|The Black Album]]'' to commemorate the album's 30th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.metallica.com/the-metallica-blacklist/ |title=The Metallica Blacklist.

The cover quickly amassed over 1 million streams on Spotify within the first 2 weeks of release and reached #12 on the [[iTunes]] rock chart. Increased media attention saw articles in ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.
