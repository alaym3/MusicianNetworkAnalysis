A [[crooner]], he found popular success, especially in the United Kingdom where he had five successive [[Top 40|Top 10]] albums in the 1960s as well as several hits on the [[UK Singles Chart]], including "If the Whole World Stopped Lovin'", "[[Walk Tall (country song)|Walk Tall]]" and "[[Elusive Butterfly]]". ''The Val Doonican Show'', which featured his singing and a variety of guests, had a long and successful run on [[BBC Television]] from 1965 to 1986, and Doonican won the [[Variety, the Children's Charity|Variety Club of Great Britain]]'s BBC-TV Personality of the Year award three times.<ref name=EPM/>

==Early life and career==
Doonican was born on 3 February 1927 in [[Waterford]], Ireland,<ref name=EPM/> the youngest of the eight children of Agnes (née Kavanagh) and John Doonican.   He was from a musical family and played in his school band from the age of six.<ref name=guardian/>  In 1941 when he was a teenager his father died, so he had to leave [[De La Salle College Waterford]], to get factory jobs fabricating steel and making orange and grapefruit boxes.<ref name=bio/> He began to perform in his hometown, often with his friend Bruce Clarke, and they had their first professional engagement as a duo in 1947.<ref name=guardian/> Doonican appeared in a summer season at [[Courtown|Courtown Harbour, County Wexford]]. He soon featured on Irish radio, sometimes with Clarke, and appeared in Waterford's first-ever television broadcast.<ref name=indy>[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/irish-singer-val-doonican-dies-aged-88-10360318.html  Heather Saul, "Val Doonican: Irish singer and entertainer dies aged 88"], ''The Independent'', 2 July 2015.</ref> Then he played the drums in a band on a tour through Ireland.

==Career in Britain==
In 1951 Doonican moved to England to join the Four Ramblers, who toured and performed on [[BBC Radio]] shows broadcast from factories, and on the ''Riders of the Range'' serials.<ref name=telegraph/> He also began performing at [[United States Air Force]] bases.<ref name=guardian/> The Ramblers supported [[Anthony Newley]] on tour<ref name=bio>{{cite web|url=http://www.valdoonican.com/biograph.htm|title=Val Doonican Biography|publisher=Valdoonican.com|access-date=5 February 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207020808/http://www.valdoonican.com/biograph.htm|archive-date=7 February 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and recognising his talent and potential as a solo act, Newley persuaded him to leave the singing group and go solo. He was auditioned for radio as a solo act, and appeared on the radio show ''[[Variety Bandbox]]''. Soon after his solo career started, he had his own radio show as well as performing in concerts and cabaret.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}  In the late 1950s, Doonican became one of the artists managed by [[Eve Taylor]], the self-described "Queen Bee" of show business, who remained his manager until her death.<ref>Doonican, Val.

After seeing him in cabaret in London in 1963, impresario [[Val Parnell]] booked him to appear on ''[[Sunday Night at the Palladium]]''.<ref name=guardian/> As a result of his performance, [[Bill Cotton]], then Assistant Head of Light Entertainment at [[BBC Television]], offered Doonican his own regular show. The TV shows were produced by [[Yvonne Littlewood]] and lasted for over 20 years. At their peak the shows attracted audiences of some 19&nbsp;million viewers.<ref name=indy/> The shows featured his relaxed crooner style, sitting in a [[rocking chair]] wearing [[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]s or jumpers,<ref name=guardian/> sometimes performing comedic Irish songs including "[[Paddy McGinty's Goat]]", "[[Delaney's Donkey]]" and "O'Rafferty's Motor Car" as well as easy listening and [[country music|country]] material on which he accompanied himself on acoustic guitar. Doonican's songs about O'Rafferty were popular enough for the BBC to publish a book, ''Val Doonican Tells The Adventures of O'Rafferty'', which retold five of the tales, in 1969.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/hd2/Archive-BBC-IDX/IDX/60s/BBC-Year-Book-1969-OCR-Page-0273.pdf#search=%22val%20doonican%22|title=General Publication|page=215|publisher=BBC Yearbook|year=1969|access-date=24 July 2014}} ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]])</ref> As his were [[variety shows]], his TV programmes gave a number of other performers, such as [[Dave Allen (comedian)|Dave Allen]], early exposure.<ref name=guardian/>  Regular guests included [[Bernard Cribbins]], [[Bob Todd]], the [[Norman Maen]] Dancers, the [[Mike Sammes]] Singers, and the [[Ken Woodman|Kenny Woodman]] Orchestra.
