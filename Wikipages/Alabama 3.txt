==History==
The band formed when Jake Black (born in Glasgow, Scotland; 27 April 1960 – 21 May 2019)<ref name=scotsman/> met Rob Spragg at a [[rave]] in [[Peckham]]. They decided that a fusion of country music with [[acid house]] was a musical possibility.<ref name="d_wayne_interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/interview/alabama3x22x10x02|title=Alabama 3 - Interview: Contact music spoke to Jake Black|date=22 October 2002|website=Contactmusic.com|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref> Other members of the band were added later: [[Nick Reynolds (sculptor)|Nick Reynolds]] is the son of one of the [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robbers]];<ref>{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Duncan |title=Has the Great Train Robbery's leader finally been unmasked? |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/sep/29/great-train-robbery-billy-hill-mastermind |access-date=29 September 2019 |work=The Observer |date=29 September 2019}}</ref> Rob Spragg was at university with Piers Marsh, the harmonica player and synthesiser programmer for the band; while Orlando Harrison, the group's keyboardist, used to live with Jake Black.<ref name="d_wayne_interview"/>

Forming initially under the name the First Presleyterian Church of Elvis the Divine (UK), the group switched names to Alabama 3 and after having been dismissed by the mainstream media as a novelty act. As with their performances under the previous name, their sound fuses electronic pop with elements of country and blues styles. They signed with [[One Little Indian Records]] in 1997 for the release of its debut album, ''[[Exile on Coldharbour Lane]]''.<ref name="onelittleindianbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.indian.co.uk/alabama3/|title=ONE LITTLE INDIAN - HOME|website=Indian.co.uk|access-date=21 May 2019|archive-date=28 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728011520/http://www.indian.co.uk/alabama3/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Every member of the group has an alias, the band's founding members adopting the personas Larry Love (Rob Spragg) and The Very Reverend Dr. D. Wayne Love (Jake Black). Their second album, ''La Peste'', featured bassist John "Segs" Jennings of the [[The Ruts|Ruts]] under the stage name Frank Zappatista.

In August 2007, the group toured under the name of Alabama 3: Acoustic and Unplugged, with Harpo Strangelove and Devlin Love, to promote new album ''[[M.O.R. (album)|M.O.R.]]''. Bassist John "Segs" Jennings left the band, saying he was "busy elsewhere and [he doesn't] have the time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freea3.org/forums/showthread.php?p=23717|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929042830/http://freea3.org/forums/showthread.php?p=23717|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 September 2007|title=Benefit Gig for Paul Fox of The Ruts. - Free A3 - The unofficial Alabama 3 forum|date=29 September 2007|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref> ''M.O.R.'' included a cover of [[Jerry Reed]]'s 1970s hit "Amos Moses", and features [[The Proclaimers]] on the track "Sweet Joy". Having recorded and toured with the band in the early days, Aurora Dawn rejoined the band in 2009. Between late 2010 and early 2011, programmer, harmonicist and founding member Piers Marsh left the band.

Jake Black, a founding band member and songwriter died of [[Addison's disease]] on 21 May 2019, several days after falling ill during a show at Highest Point Festival in [[Lancashire]]. He was 59.<ref name=scotsman>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/obituaries/obituary-jake-black-lead-singer-alabama-3-who-provided-theme-song-sopranos-1414895|title=Obituary: Jake Black, lead singer of the Alabama 3, who provided the theme song to The Sopranos|last=Pendreigh|first=Brian|date=21 June 2019|website=The Scotsman|language=en|access-date=February 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/jake-black-alabama-3-died-2490786|title=Alabama 3 co-founder Jake Black has died|first=Will|last=Lavin|date=21 May 2019|website=Nme.com|access-date=21 May 2019}}</ref>

===Mountain of Love===
[[File:Mountain of Love.jpg|thumb|235px|right|Mountain of Love]]
'''Mountain of Love''' is a [[dubtronica]] group formed by two of the original three members of Alabama 3, Piers Marsh and Sir Eddie Real, in 2011 in [[Brixton|Brixton, London]].<ref name="MoLWebsite">{{cite web | last = Marsh | first = Piers | title = Mountain of Love | url=http://mountainoflove.org/|website=Mountainoflove.org | access-date = 31 March 2013 }}</ref> The band's eponymous first album was released in 2013 on Cooked Griffin Records.

==Style==
Alabama 3's sound is a blend of [[American country music|country]], [[blues]], and [[acid house]].<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=12}}</ref> The band's songs have sampled [[Jim Jones]] in "[[Mao Zedong|Mao Tse Tung]] Said" and [[Birmingham Six]] survivor Patrick Hill in "The Thrills Have Gone." [[Trouser Press]] reviewer Jason Reeher wrote that A3's "debut is brilliant and shambolic...owing huge debts to both Hank Williams and Happy Mondays."
