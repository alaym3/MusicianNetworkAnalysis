'''Mott the Hoople''' are <!-- This article is written in British-English, which commonly treats collective nouns as plural. Please do NOT change "were" to "was". Thank you. --> an English [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Herefordshire]], England. Originally known as the Doc Thomas Group, the group changed their name after signing with [[Island Records]] in 1969. The band released albums throughout the early 1970s but failed to find commercial success. On the verge of breaking up, the band were encouraged by [[David Bowie]] to stay together. Bowie wrote the [[glam rock]] song "[[All the Young Dudes]]" for them, which became a huge commercial success in 1972. Bowie subsequently produced an album [[All the Young Dudes (album)|of the same name]] for them, which continued their success.

Despite personnel changes, the band had further commercial success with ''[[Mott (album)|Mott]]'' (1973) and ''[[The Hoople]]'' (1974). Lead singer [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]] departed the band in 1974, after which the band's commercial fortunes began to dwindle. They remained together with continuing personnel changes until their break-up in 1980. The band have had reunions in 2009, 2013, 2018 and 2019, and have reunited as of 2020.

==History==
===Pre-Mott===
The Doc Thomas Group were formed in 1966 with [[Mick Ralphs]] on guitar, Stan Tippins on vocals, and [[Pete Overend Watts]] on bass. Ralphs and Tippins had been in a local [[Hereford]] band the Buddies, and Watts had been in a local [[Ross-on-Wye]] band the Soulents with [[Dale Griffin|Dale "Buffin" Griffin]] on drums. The Doc Thomas Group had a [[concert residency]] at a nightclub in a resort town in Italy. The group was offered a recording contract with the Italian label Dischi Interrecord, and released an eponymous album in January 1967. By 1968, Griffin and [[Electronic organ|organist]] [[Verden Allen]] had joined the band.

Although the group toured and recorded in Italy as the Doc Thomas Group, their [[concert|gigs]] in the UK were played under the names of the Shakedown Sound and later, as Silence. Silence recorded [[demo (music)|demos]] at [[Rockfield Studios]] in [[Monmouth]], Wales, which were shopped to [[EMI Records|EMI]], [[Polydor Records|Polydor]], [[Immediate Records|Immediate]] and [[Apple Records|Apple]] with no success.

===Early years===
The group came to the attention of [[Guy Stevens]] at [[Island Records|Island]], who liked the group but not with Tippins as lead singer. Advertisements were placed ("Singer wanted, must be image-minded and hungry"), and [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]] was selected as lead singer and piano player. Tippins assumed the role of [[road manager]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>
While in prison on a drug offence, Stevens read the [[Willard Manus]] novel ''[[Mott the Hoople (novel)|Mott the Hoople]]'', about an eccentric who works in a [[circus]] [[freak show]], and decided to use it as a band name.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{Cite book

The band's debut album, ''Mott the Hoople'' (1969), [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] in only a week,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> was a [[cult]] success. Their repertoire included [[cover version]]s of "Laugh at Me" ([[Sonny Bono]]) and "At the Crossroads" ([[Doug Sahm]]'s [[Sir Douglas Quintet]]), and an [[instrumental]] cover of "[[You Really Got Me]]" ([[The Kinks]]).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{Cite book

The second album, ''[[Mad Shadows (album)|Mad Shadows]]'' (1970), sold poorly and received generally negative reviews. ''Wildlife'' (1971) fared even worse (despite gaining the highest UK album chart position of the band's pre-Glam years), and flirted with an overtly country-hippie stance and more acoustic instrumentation on some Ralphs-penned songs . On 10 October 1970, Mott the Hoople and [[Bridget St John]] were showcased on [[BBC2]]'s ''Disco 2''.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{Cite book

The group decided to split following a depressing concert in a disused [[gas holder]] in Switzerland.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> When combined with an aborted UK tour with The Lothringers, the band was close to breaking up.

===Glam years===
[[David Bowie]] had long been a fan of the band. After learning from Watts that they were about to split,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> he persuaded them to stay together and offered them "[[Suffragette City]]" from his then yet-to-be-released ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]]'' album.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> They turned it down. Bowie also penned "[[All the Young Dudes]]" for them and it became their biggest hit.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Released as a single in July 1972,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{Cite book

Bowie produced an album, also called ''[[All the Young Dudes (album)|All the Young Dudes]]'', which included a [[Mick Ronson]] strings and brass arrangement for "Sea Diver". It sold well, but stalled at No.&nbsp;21 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Another casualty in the wake of ''All the Young Dudes'' was Verden Allen, who departed before the release of their next album, ''[[Mott (album)|Mott]]''.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

''Mott'' climbed into the [[Top 40|Top 10]] of the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> and became the band's best seller to date in the US. It yielded two UK hits, "[[Honaloochie Boogie]]" and "[[All the Way from Memphis]]",<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> both featuring [[Andy Mackay]] of [[Roxy Music]] on saxophone. "All the Way from Memphis" is also featured in the movie ''[[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore]]''.

In May 1973, following Verden Allen's departure, the band was augmented by two keyboard players. Former [[Love Affair (band)|Love Affair]] and [[Morgan (band)|Morgan]] member [[Morgan Fisher]] joined as keyboardist<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> and Mick Bolton joined on [[Hammond Organ]]. Bolton left at the end of 1973 and was replaced on tour by [[Blue Weaver]], while Fisher stayed on to become Allen's official replacement in the band. Ralphs left in August 1973 to form [[Bad Company]] and was replaced by former [[Spooky Tooth]] guitarist [[Luther Grosvenor]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> For contractual reasons, he changed his name to Ariel Bender at the suggestion of singer-songwriter [[Lynsey de Paul]] for his stint with the band.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> According to Ian Hunter, interviewed in the documentary ''Ballad of Mott the Hoople'', the band were in Germany with de Paul for a TV show when Mick Ralphs walked down a street bending a succession of car aerials in frustration. De Paul came out with the phrase "aerial bender" which Hunter later suggested to Grosvenor as a stage name.<ref>''Ballad of Mott the Hoople'' documentary, c. 39:30</ref>

In 1974, the band had a chart success in the UK with "[[Roll Away the Stone]]" recorded before [[Mick Ralphs]] left the band. Ralphs played lead guitar and the [[Thunderthighs]] provided female vocal backing and a bridge. It reached No.8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=British Hit Singles & Albums|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited.|year=2006|isbn=1904994105|edition=19|location=London|pages=381}}</ref>

In 1974, Mott the Hoople toured America with [[Luther Grosvenor|Ariel Bender]] playing lead guitar. In one of Bender's earliest performances with the band they played the Masonic Temple in Detroit on 12 October 1973 with a young Aerosmith opening the show. They were primarily supported on the '74 tour by the band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. This tour later provided the inspiration for Queen's 1975 single "[[Now I'm Here]]", which contains the [[lyrics]] "''Down in the city, just Hoople and me.''" The song became a live favourite of Queen fans and reached No.&nbsp;11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums 2">{{Cite book

Morgan Fisher went on to play piano on Queen's 'Hot Space' tour in 1982, and [[Brian May]], [[Freddie Mercury]] and [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] performed backing vocals on the Ian Hunter solo song, "You Nearly Did Me In". May would later cover Mott's "All the Way from Memphis" on his solo album, ''[[Another World (Brian May album)|Another World]]'', with Hunter making a guest appearance. Mott the Hoople are name-checked on two other hit singles. [[Reunion (band)|Reunion]]'s 1974 single "[[Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)]]" begins with the [[lyrics]] 'B Bumble and the Stingers, Mott the Hoople, Ray Charles Singers...'.;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lyrics007.com/Reunion%20Lyrics/Life%20Is%20A%20Rock%20Lyrics.html |title=Lyrics for "Life Is a Rock (But the Radio Rolled Me)" @ |publisher=Lyrics007.com |date=3 June 2010 |access-date=7 April 2011}}</ref> and [[R.E.M.]]'s "[[Man on the Moon (song)|Man on the Moon]]" begins with 'Mott the Hoople and the Game of Life, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...'

In the afterglow of ''[[The Hoople]]'' (1974), a live album ''Live'' was quickly released, after which [[Mick Ronson]] replaced Bender.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> The end was near when both Hunter and Ronson left the group to form a [[Musical ensemble#Two parts|duo]], following which the band abbreviated its name to 'Mott'.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

Hunter's book ''[[Diary of a Rock'n'Roll Star]]'' about the day-to-day life on the band's 1972 winter tour of the US, covering the ups and downs of life on the road,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> was published in June 1974. It was out of print for many years but was reissued in 1996.<ref>''Diary of a Rock 'n' Roll Star'', Ian Hunter: (Independent Music Press; {{ISBN|978-1897783092}}). Retrieved 24 March 2013.</ref>

===Post-Hunter years===
The new line-up consisted of Watts, Griffin, and Fisher along with lead guitarist Ray Major (formerly of Opal Butterfly, Hackensack, and a brief stint with Andy Fraser and Frankie Miller) and front man Nigel Benjamin. This line-up released two more albums, ''[[Drive On (Mott album)|Drive On]]'' (1975) and ''[[Shouting and Pointing]]'' (1976), both of which sold poorly.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> After Benjamin quit in 1976, Mott briefly replaced him with Steve Hyams,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/steve-hyams-rip/ |title=Steve Hyams RIP &#124; News &#124; Classic Rock |publisher=Classicrockmagazine.com |access-date=2 November 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103090401/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/steve-hyams-rip/ |archive-date=3 November 2013}}</ref> before joining forces with John Fiddler (formerly of [[Medicine Head]]), and became [[British Lions (band)|British Lions]], recording two albums, ''[[British Lions (album)|British Lions]]'' (1977) and ''Trouble With Women'' (posthumously released on Cherry Red Records 1980) before finally splitting up without any [[record chart|chart]] success.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Hunter and Ronson worked and toured together sporadically until Ronson's death in 1993.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> Hunter has continued his solo career.

In 1990, after a brief reunion in 1989, the former members of The Silence reunited in the studio to record a mix of new songs and staples from their days performing together. The resultant album ''Shotgun Eyes'' was released in 1998, combined with ''The Italian Job'' (a re-release of the Doc Thomas Group's self-titled album).<ref>{{cite web|last = Perkins|first = Adrian|year = 2005|title = Doc Thomas Group LP/CD: "The Italian Job"|publisher=Mott the Hoople and Ian Hunter – The unofficial site for Mott the Hoople and Ian Hunter|url = http://www.hunter-mott.com/discography/the_italian_job.html|access-date = 4 November 2010}}</ref>

In 1996 [[K-tel]] released a CD called ''The Best of Mott the Hoople'' purporting to be re-recordings of the band's [[hit record|hits]] and new songs by Hunter and Ronson. In actuality, the recording was by [[Danny McCulloch]], former bass player with [[Eric Burdon and the New Animals]] and Gerry Chapman, usually going under the band name of The Trybe. The album consisted of [[Hard rock|heavy rock]] versions of Mott's hits and original songs, and had nothing at all to do with the original Mott the Hoople. K-tel were subsequently fined for supplying goods with a false description, but the tracks and album continued to circulate under the name Mott the Hoople, often appearing on [[compilation album]]s. In 2002, the tracks were released again as ''I Can't Believe It's Not Mott the Hoople!'', though this time it was credited to The Trybe.

On 16 and 17 April 1999, the first and only 'Mott the Hoople Convention' was held at the Robin Hood Pub in [[Bilston]], [[Wolverhampton]], England. Hunter and his band performed both evenings of the convention. During the encore of the Ian Hunter Band's performance of 17 April, Hunter was joined onstage by Bender and Allen for a version of "Walkin' With A Mountain"; Allen performed on the original studio version of the song, whilst Bender performed an extended solo during performances of the song on Mott the Hoople's 1973–74 tours.

In 2002 and 2004, Ralphs toured with Hunter, as part of the latter's backing band.

No Mott the Hoople reunion occurred prior to 2009, although negotiations for one were attempted in 1985; all parties have shown some interest at various times in the idea over the last 30 years. In 2005 it was reported in the publication ''Classic Rock'', that Hunter had received the offer of a seven-figure number to re-form the band. In October 2007 at Hunter's concert at the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]], he was joined by Ralphs and Allen for the encore.

===2009 reunion===
[[File:Mott the Hoople.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mott the Hoople reunion, 2009]]
On 16 January 2009, it was announced that the band would be re-uniting for two concerts at the [[Hammersmith Apollo]] in London, in October 2009.<ref>[https://www.nme.com/news/various-artists/42112 Mott the Hoople to play two anniversary shows] – NME.com</ref> According to Hunter's web site, all five of the original members would participate in the reunion. Hunter wrote, "Why are we doing it? I can't speak for the others, but I'm doing it just to see what it's like. Short of war, death, famine etc. ...it's ON."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ianhunter.com/ |title=Ian Hunter's official website |publisher=Ianhunter.com |date=21 July 2009 |access-date=7 April 2011}}</ref> Tickets for the two original dates sold out, and a third date at the same venue was added for 3 October 2009. After that one sold out as well another two dates were added on 5 and 6 October. The special limited 3 CD-set recorded during the first show at Hammersmith Apollo was sold directly after the concerts.

Mott the Hoople also held a warmup gig prior to their five-night stand at the HMV Hammersmith Apollo in October. The show was held at the Blake Theatre in [[Monmouth]], Wales, on 26 September 2009. Prior to this it was announced that because of the poor health of [[Dale Griffin|Buffin]], his place for the concerts would be taken by [[Martin Chambers]], drummer of [[The Pretenders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mottthehoople.com/news.shtml |title=Mott the Hoople news |publisher=Mottthehoople.com |access-date=7 April 2011}}</ref> though Griffin did appear at encores.

The reunion was favourably reviewed by major British broadsheet newspapers, with ''[[The Guardian]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|author=Alexis Petridis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/02/mott-the-hoople-review |title=Mott the Hoople: Hammersmith Apollo, London |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 2 October 2009|access-date=7 April 2011}}</ref> ''[[The Times]]''<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110312050253/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/live_reviews/article6859430.ece Mott the Hoople at Hammersmith Apollo] 3 October 2009.

===2013 dates===
Mott the Hoople (featuring Allen, Hunter, Ralphs and Watts with Martin Chambers on drums) played the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] in London on 18 November 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ianhunter.com/main/ |title=Ian Hunter's Official Site |publisher=Ianhunter.com |access-date=23 April 2013}}</ref> preceded by dates in Birmingham, Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester (the latter of which was recorded for a limited edition CD/DVD). One critic described the concert at the O2 Arena as "a bit of a slog" and Hunter's voice as "now little more than a guttural rasp".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/19/mott-the-hoople-review | title=Mott the Hoople – review | newspaper=The Guardian | date=19 November 2013 | access-date=16 December 2013 | author=Gittins, Ian}}</ref> A recording of 17 November 2013 show at the [[O2 Apollo Manchester]] was released in June 2014 as a double album/DVD, ''Live 2013.'' Several years after the 2013 reunion, Mott the Hoople lost two of its founding members: Dale Griffin died on 17 January 2016 at the age of 67, and Overend Watts died on 22 January 2017 at the age of 69.

===2018 dates===
In February 2018 it was announced that Mott the Hoople would be playing several European dates in the summer of 2018. Ian Hunter will be joined by former bandmates Morgan Fisher on keyboards and Ariel Bender on guitar. In a press release, Hunter said "[Fisher and Bender] toured extensively with Mott and both were featured heavily on ''The Hoople'' album after Mick Ralphs and Verden Allen left the band... I know many people were disappointed when neither appeared on the 2009 and 2013 get-togethers. Hope this makes up for it!"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/mott-the-hoople-reunion-2018/ | title=Mott the Hoople announce rare reunion | publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock | date=9 February 2018 | access-date=14 February 2018 | author=Deriso, Nick}}</ref> The line-up will also include James Mastro and Mark Bosch on guitars, Dennis DiBrizzi on keyboards, Paul Page on bass, and [[Steve Holley]] on drums. Holley – a member of [[Wings (band)|Wings]] from 1978 to 1981 – has been a member of Hunter's "Rant Band" since 2001.

===2019 dates===
In January 2019, the band announced the "Tax the Heat" tour, a brief six-show UK tour in April 2019, preceded by an eight-date tour of the US as "Mott the Hoople '74" (which began on 1 April and concluded on 10 April at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in [[New York City]]). This was the first time in 45 years that Mott The Hoople had toured the US. Indeed, the core '74 members Ian Hunter, Ariel Bender and Morgan Fisher celebrated the 45th anniversary of their 1974 US tour (hence the name of the bill), as well as the original release of ''[[The Hoople]]'' and ''[[Live (Mott the Hoople album)|Live]]'', the final albums of the classic Mott The Hoople era. The band includes Ian Hunter (vocals and guitar), Ariel Bender (guitar) and Morgan Fisher (keyboards) joined by James Mastro (guitar, saxophone, mandolin), Steve Holley (drums, backing vocals), Mark Bosch (guitar), Paul Page (bass) and Dennis Dibrizzi (keyboards, backing vocals).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2019/01/music-news-this-april-mott-the-hoople-74-will-tour-the-usa-for-the-first-time-in-45-years-after-their-brief-6-show.html|title=Mott the Hoople to Tour the USA After 45yr Absence|website=Music News Net|access-date=22 May 2019}}</ref>
