'''Dean Martin''' (born '''Dino Paul Crocetti'''; June 7, 1917 – December 25, 1995) was an American singer, actor and comedian. One of the most popular and enduring American entertainers of the mid-20th century, Martin was nicknamed "The King of Cool."<ref>{{cite web| author=mike says| url=http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/celebrities/dean-martins-diva-daughter-elvis-called-dad-the-king-cool/| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002153725/http://blog.blogtalkradio.com/celebrities/dean-martins-diva-daughter-elvis-called-dad-the-king-cool/| url-status=dead| archive-date=October 2, 2011| title=Dean Martin's Diva Daughter: Elvis Called My Dad 'The King of Cool'| publisher=Blog.blogtalkradio.com| date=July 23, 2009| access-date=November 4, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/245966#survey| title=Dean Martin 'just a golfer' to his kids| newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]| first=Cassandra| last=Szklarski| agency=[[Canadian Press]]| date=August 14, 2007| access-date=2021-10-01}}</ref> Martin gained his career breakthrough together with comedian [[Jerry Lewis]], billed as [[Martin & Lewis]], in 1946. They performed in nightclubs and later had numerous appearances on radio, television and in films.

Following an acrimonious ending of the partnership in 1956, Martin pursued a solo career as a performer and actor. Martin established himself as a singer, recording numerous contemporary songs as well as standards from the [[Great American Songbook]]. He became one of the most popular acts in Las Vegas and was known for his friendship with fellow artists [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], who together with several others formed the [[Rat Pack]].

Starting in 1965, Martin was the host of the television variety program ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'', which centered on Martin's singing and comedic talents and was characterized by his relaxed, easy-going demeanor. From 1974 to 1984, he was [[roastmaster]] on the popular ''[[Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'', which drew celebrities, comedians and politicians. Throughout his career, Martin performed in concert stages, nightclubs, audio recordings and appeared in 85 film and television productions.

His best known songs include "[[Ain't That a Kick in the Head?]]", "[[Memories Are Made of This]]", "[[That's Amore]]", "[[Everybody Loves Somebody]]", "[[You're Nobody till Somebody Loves You]]", "[[Sway (Luis Demetrio song)|Sway]]", and "[[Nel blu, dipinto di blu (song)#Volare (Dean Martin)|Volare]]".

==Early life==
[[File:Dean Martin Mural in Steubenville.jpg|left|thumb|Mural of Dean Martin in Steubenville, Ohio]]

Martin was born Dino Paul Crocetti on June 7, 1917, in [[Steubenville, Ohio]], to Italian father Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894–1967) and Italian-American mother Angela Crocetti (''née'' Barra; 1899–1966). His father, who was a barber, was originally from [[Montesilvano|Montesilvano, Abruzzo]], and his mother's origins are also believed to be from Abruzzo, although they are not clearly known. Martin had an older brother named William Alfonso Crocetti (1916–1968).<ref>1920 Census [https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:MDBB-9M7] FamilySearch</ref> His first language was Italian and he did not speak English until he started school at the age of five. He attended Grant Elementary School in Steubenville, where he was bullied for his [[broken English]]. As a teenager, he played the drums as a hobby. He dropped out of [[Steubenville High School]] in the tenth grade because, according to Martin, he thought he was smarter than his teachers.<ref name=SONGSTERS>{{cite book| last=Parish| first=James Robert| title=Hollywood Songsters: Singers Who ACT and Actors Who Sing: A Biographical Dictionary| volume=2| year=2003| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p3HWDtBhLykC&dq=dean+martin&pg=PA386-IA1| publisher=Routledge| location=New York| isbn=978-0-415-94333-8| page=533}}</ref> He [[Rum-running|bootlegged liquor]], worked in a steel mill, served as a [[croupier]] at a [[speakeasy]] and a [[blackjack]] dealer, and was a welterweight boxer.<ref name="bio">{{cite web |url=https://www.deanmartin.com/bio/ |website=The Official Dean Martin site |title=Dean Martin Bio |access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>

At 15 he billed himself as "Kid Crochet". His prizefighting earned him a broken nose (later straightened), a scarred lip, many broken knuckles (a result of not being able to afford tape used to wrap boxers' hands), and a bruised body. Of his 12 bouts, he said that he "won all but 11".{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=57}} For a time, he shared a New York City apartment with [[Sonny King (singer)|Sonny King]], who was also starting in show business and had little money. The two reportedly charged people to watch them bare-knuckle box each other in their apartment, fighting until one was knocked out. Martin knocked out King in the first round of an amateur boxing match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing-scoop.com/show_boxer.php?boxer_ID=11280 |title=Dean Martin Amateur Boxing Record|publisher=Boxing-Scoop.com|date=June 7, 1917|access-date=April 15, 2012}}</ref> Martin gave up boxing to work as a [[roulette]] stickman and croupier in an illegal casino behind a tobacco shop, where he had started as a stock boy. At the same time, he sang with local bands, calling himself "Dino Martini" (after the Metropolitan Opera tenor [[Nino Martini]]). He got his break working for the [[Ernie McKay Orchestra]]. He sang in a crooning style influenced by Harry Mills of the [[Mills Brothers]] and [[Perry Como]].<ref name="bio" /> By late 1940 he had begun singing for Cleveland bandleader [[Sammy Watkins (musician)|Sammy Watkins]],<ref>Pullen, Glenn C.

In October 1941, Martin married Elizabeth "Betty" Anne McDonald in [[Cleveland]], and the couple had an apartment in [[Cleveland Heights]] for a while.{{sfn|Martin|Holden|2010|p=11}} They eventually had four children before the marriage ended in 1949.{{sfn|Martin|Holden|2010|p=25}}

==Career==
===Teaming with Jerry Lewis===
{{main|Martin and Lewis}}[[File:Lewis and Martin.jpg|thumb|left|Martin with [[Jerry Lewis]] in 1950]]
<!-- [[File:Dean Martin Jerry Lewis 1955 Colgate Comedy Hour.JPG|right|thumb|Martin and Lewis in 1955]] -->
Martin attracted the attention of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Columbia Pictures]], but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming. He met comic [[Jerry Lewis]] at the Glass Hat Club in New York, where both were performing. [[Martin and Lewis]] formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]]'s 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, [[Skinny D'Amato]], warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to "go for broke", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material.<ref>Ambalal, Monica. The Grove Dictionary of American Music, 2nd edition. University of Michigan. Oxford University Press, Inc. 2013</ref> Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with bread rolls.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kehr |first=Dave |author-link=Dave Kehr |date=August 20, 2017 |title=Jerry Lewis, a Jester Both Silly and Stormy, Dies at 91 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/20/movies/jerry-lewis-dead-celebrated-comedian-and-filmmaker.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=August 20, 2017}}</ref>

They performed [[slapstick]], reeled off old [[vaudeville]] jokes and did whatever else popped into their heads. The audience laughed. This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]]. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' (then called ''The Toast Of The Town'') on June 20, 1948, with composers [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]] also appearing. Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers [[Norman Lear]] and Ed Simmons to write their bits.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/features/norman-lear-recalls-early-days-as-tv-comedy-writer-1201629371/ |title=Norman Lear Looks Back on Early Days as TV Comedy Writer |first=Tim |last=Gray |date=October 30, 2015 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}</ref> With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs.<ref>{{cite magazine| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgoEAAAAMBAJ&q=%2252g+to+simmons%22&pg=PA12-IA1| page=12| title=52G to Simmons, Lear to Do Five Martin-Lewis Shows| date=October 31, 1953| magazine=Billboard| via=Google Books}}</ref>

A [[The Martin and Lewis Show (radio program)|radio series]] began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] producer [[Hal B. Wallis]] as comedy relief for the movie ''[[My Friend Irma (film)|My Friend Irma]]''. Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood's best deals: although they received only $75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=208}}

They also controlled their club, record, radio, and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In ''Dean & Me'', Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. They were friends, as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction.{{sfn|Lewis|Kaplan|2005|p=223}} He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis. Martin told his partner he was "nothing to me but a dollar sign". The act broke up in 1956, ten years to the day from the first teaming.<ref>{{cite news |title=Martin & Lewis breakup recalled |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2005-oct-19-et-quick19.3-story.html |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=October 19, 2005 |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

===Solo career===
[[File:Dean Martin portrait (from Ada trailer).jpg|thumb|Martin in the film ''[[Ada (1961 film)|Ada]]'' (1961)]]
Martin's first solo film, ''[[Ten Thousand Bedrooms]]'' (1957), was a box-office failure.<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |author-link=Bosley Crowther |date=April 4, 1957 |title=Screen: Solo by Martin; Singer Is Seen at State Without Jerry Lewis |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1957/04/04/archives/screen-solo-by-martin-singer-is-seen-at-state-without-jerry-lewis.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> Although "[[Nel blu, dipinto di blu (song)#Volare (Dean Martin)|Volare]]" reached number fifteen in the U.S. and number 2 in the UK, the era of the pop [[crooner]] was waning with the advent of [[rock and roll]]. Martin wanted to become a dramatic actor, known for more than slapstick comedy films. Though offered a fraction of his former salary to co-star in a war drama, ''[[The Young Lions (film)|The Young Lions]]'' (1958), his part would be with [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Montgomery Clift]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=April 3, 1958 |title=Irwin Shaw's 'Young Lions'; War Story Is Offered at the Paramount Brando, Martin and Clift Are Starred |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/04/03/archives/irwin-shaws-young-lions-war-story-is-offered-at-the-paramount.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> [[Tony Randall]] already had the part, but talent agency MCA realized that with this film, Martin would become a triple threat: they could make money from his work in nightclubs, films, and records. Randall was paid off to relinquish the role, Martin replaced him and the film turned out to be the beginning of Martin's comeback.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|pp=299–300}} Martin starred alongside [[Frank Sinatra]] for the first time in the [[Vincente Minnelli]] drama, ''[[Some Came Running (1958 film)|Some Came Running]]'' (1958).<ref>{{cite news |last=Crowther |first=Bosley |date=January 23, 1959 |title=The Screen: James Jones' 'Some Came Running'; Sinatra, Dean Martin Star at Music Hall Post-War Indiana Tale Directed by Minnelli |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1959/01/23/archives/the-screen-james-jones-some-came-running-sinatra-dean-martin-star.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> By the mid-1960s, Martin was a movie, recording, television, and nightclub star.

[[File:Dean Martin - Rio Bravo 1959.jpg|thumb|In ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959)]]
As a singer, Martin copied the styles of Harry Mills (of the [[Mills Brothers]]), [[Bing Crosby]], and [[Perry Como]] until he developed his own and could hold his own in duets with Sinatra and Crosby. Like Sinatra, he could not read music,<ref name="Chilton telegraph">{{cite news |last=Chilton |first=Martin |date=December 24, 2015 |title=Dean Martin: the man whose voice captured Christmas |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/artists/dean-martin-the-man-whose-voice-captured-christmas/ |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> but he recorded more than 100 albums and 600 songs.

[[Elvis Presley]] was said to have been a fan of Martin, and patterned his performance of "[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]" after Martin's style.

The image of Martin as a Vegas entertainer in a tuxedo has been an enduring one.

{{Main|Rat Pack}}

As Martin's solo career grew, he and Frank Sinatra became friends. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Martin and Sinatra, along with friends [[Joey Bishop]], [[Peter Lawford]], and [[Sammy Davis Jr.]] formed the Rat Pack, so-called after an earlier group of social friends, the [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles|Holmby Hills]] Rat Pack centered on [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], of which Sinatra had been a member (The Martin-Sinatra-Davis-Lawford-Bishop group referred to themselves as "The Summit" or "The Clan" and never as "The Rat Pack", although this has remained their identity in popular imagination). The men made films together, formed part of the Hollywood social scene, and were politically influential (through Lawford's marriage to Patricia Kennedy, sister of President [[John F. Kennedy]]).<ref>{{cite news |last=Fessier |first=Bruce |author-link=Bruce Fessier |date=October 20, 2015 |title='Brother-in-Lawford' was Sinatra's key to White House |url=https://www.desertsun.com/story/life/entertainment/2015/10/20/brother-lawford-sinatras-key-white-house/74286532/ |newspaper=[[The Desert Sun]] |location=Palm Springs |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

The Rat Pack was legendary for its [[Las Vegas Strip]] performances. For example, the marquee at the [[Sands Hotel and Casino|Sands Hotel]] might read "DEAN MARTIN—MAYBE FRANK—MAYBE SAMMY." Their appearances were valuable because the city would flood with wealthy gamblers. Their act (always in tuxedo) consisted of each singing individual numbers, duets and trios, along with seemingly improvised slapstick and chatter. In the socially charged 1960s, their jokes revolved around adult themes, such as Sinatra's womanizing and Martin's drinking, as well as Davis's race and religion. Sinatra and Martin supported the civil rights movement and refused to perform in clubs that would not allow African-American or Jewish performers.<ref name="FRANKSINATRA-NANCY">{{cite book| last=Sinatra| first=Nancy| title=Frank Sinatra: An American Legend| year=1998| url=https://archive.org/details/franksinatraamer00sina/page/156/mode/2up| publisher=General Publishing Group| location=Santa Monica| isbn=978-1-8816-4968-7| page=156| url-access=registration}}</ref> Posthumously, the Rat Pack has experienced a popular revival, inspiring the [[George Clooney]]/[[Brad Pitt]] ''[[Ocean's Trilogy]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Horton |first=Oliver |date=January 26, 2002 |title=A Youthful Revival of Rat Pack Style |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/26/news/a-youthful-revival-of-rat-pack-style.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

===''The Dean Martin Show''===
{{Main|The Dean Martin Show}}
[[File:Dean Martin Florence Henderson 1958.JPG|thumb|right|Martin and [[Florence Henderson]] in ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' (1968)]]
In 1965, Martin launched his weekly [[NBC]] comedy-variety series, ''The Dean Martin Show'', which ran for 264 episodes until 1974. He won a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Television Series Musical or Comedy]] in 1966 and was nominated again the following three years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/tv-show/dean-martin-show |title=Dean Martin Show, The |website=Golden Globe Awards |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> The show exploited his image as a carefree boozer. Martin capitalized on his laid-back persona of the half-drunk [[crooner]], hitting on women with remarks that would get anyone else slapped, and making snappy if slurred remarks about fellow celebrities during his [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]]. During an interview on the British TV documentary ''Wine, Women and Song'', aired in 1983, he stated, perhaps tongue-in-cheek, that he had someone record them on cassette tape so he could listen to them. His TV show was a success. The show's loose format featured quick-witted improvisation from Martin and his weekly guests. This prompted a battle between Martin and NBC censors, who insisted on more scrutiny of the content. He later had trouble with NBC for his off-the-cuff use of obscene Italian phrases, which brought complaints from viewers who spoke the language. The show was often in the Top Ten. Martin, appreciative of the show's producer, his friend [[Greg Garrison]], made a handshake deal giving Garrison, a pioneer TV producer in the 1950s, 50% of the show. However, the validity of that ownership is the subject of a lawsuit brought by [[NBCUniversal]].

Despite Martin's reputation as a drinker—perpetuated via his vanity license plate "DRUNKY"—his alcohol use was quite disciplined.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=198}} He was often the first to call it a night, and when not on tour or on a film location, liked to go home to see his wife and children.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Susan |date=December 25, 2015 |title=Newsletter: Classic Hollywood: What was Dean Martin really drinking? |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/classichollywood/la-et-mn-classic-hollywood-newsletter-dean-martin-20151225-html-htmlstory.html |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref> He borrowed the lovable-drunk [[shtick]] from [[Joe E. Lewis]], but his convincing portrayals of heavy boozers in ''[[Some Came Running]]'' and Howard Hawks's ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' led to unsubstantiated claims of [[alcoholism]]. Martin starred in and co-produced four [[Matt Helm]] [[superspy]] comedy adventures during this time, as well as a number of [[Westerns]]. By the early 1970s, ''The Dean Martin Show'' was still earning solid ratings, and although he was no longer a Top 40 hitmaker, his record albums continued to sell. He found a way to make his passion for golf profitable by offering a signature line of golf balls and the [[Dean Martin Tucson Open]] was an event on golf's [[PGA Tour]] from 1972 to 1975. At his death, Martin was reportedly the single largest minority shareholder of RCA stock.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Now comfortable financially, Martin began reducing his schedule. The final (1973–1974) season of his variety show was retooled into one of celebrity [[Roast (comedy)|roasts]], requiring less involvement. In the roasts, Martin and his panel of pals made fun of a variety of popular entertainment, athletic, and political figures.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|pp=413–414}} After the show's cancellation, NBC continued to air ''[[The Dean Martin Celebrity Roast]]'' as a series of TV specials through 1984.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=517}}

===Later career===
For nearly a decade, Martin had recorded as many as four albums a year for [[Reprise Records]]. Martin recorded his final Reprise album, ''[[Once in a While (Dean Martin album)|Once in a While]]'' in 1974, which was not issued until 1978. His final recordings were made for [[Warner Bros. Records]]. ''[[The Nashville Sessions (Dean Martin album)|The Nashville Sessions]]'' was released in 1983, from which he had a hit with "(I Think That I Just Wrote) My First Country Song", which was recorded with [[Conway Twitty]] and made a respectable showing on the country charts. A follow-up single, "L.A. Is My Home"/"Drinking Champagne", came in 1985. The 1974 film drama ''[[Mr. Ricco]]'' marked Martin's final starring role, in which he played a criminal defense lawyer. He played a featured role in the 1981 comedy ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and its [[Cannonball Run II|sequel]], both starring [[Burt Reynolds]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Canby |first=Vincent |date=June 20, 1981 |title='Cannonball Run' With Burt Reynolds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/20/movies/cannonball-run-with-burt-reynolds.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Maslin |first=Janet |author-link=Janet Maslin |date=June 29, 1984 |title=SCREEN: Burt Reynolds In 'Cannonball Run II' |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/29/movies/screen-burt-reynolds-in-cannonball-run-ii.html |newspaper=The New York Times |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

In 1972, he filed for divorce from his second wife, Jeanne. A week later, his business partnership with the [[Riviera (hotel and casino)|Riviera]] hotel in [[Las Vegas]] dissolved amid reports of the casino's refusal to agree to Martin's request to perform only once a night. He joined the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], where he was the featured performer on the hotel's opening night of December 23, 1973, and his contract required him to star in a film (''Mr. Ricco'') for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] studios. Less than a month after his second marriage had dissolved, Martin was 55 when he married 26-year-old Catherine Hawn, on April 25, 1973. Hawn had been the receptionist at the chic Gene Shacove hair salon in Beverly Hills.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=398}} They divorced November 10, 1976. He was also briefly engaged to [[Gail Renshaw]], [[Miss World]]–U.S.A. 1969.{{sfn|Tosches|1992|pp=392–394}} Eventually, Martin reconciled with Jeanne, though they never remarried.

Martin also made a public reconciliation with Lewis on his [[The Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon|partner's Labor Day telethon]], benefiting the [[Muscular Dystrophy Association]], in September 1976. Sinatra shocked Lewis by bringing Martin out on stage and as the two men embraced, the audience gave them a [[standing ovation]] and the phones lit up, resulting in one of the telethon's most profitable years up to that time. Lewis later reported the event was one of the three most memorable of his life. Lewis quipped, "So, you working?" Martin, playing drunk, replied that he was appearing "at the 'Meggum'" (meaning the MGM Grand Hotel). This, with the death of Martin's son [[Dean Paul Martin]] more than a decade later, helped bring the two men together. They maintained a quiet friendship, but only performed again once, in 1989, on Martin's 72nd birthday.<ref name="Talevski">{{cite book| last=Talevski| first=Nick| title=Knocking on Heaven's Door: Rock Obituaries| date=April 7, 2010| publisher=Omnibus Press| isbn=978-1-84609-091-2| page=399| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DykffzkFALoC&q=dean+paul+martin}}</ref>

Martin returned to films briefly with appearances in the star-laden, critically panned but commercially successful ''[[The Cannonball Run]]'' and its sequel ''[[Cannonball Run II]]''. He also had a minor hit single with "[[Since I Met You Baby (song)|Since I Met You Baby]]" and made his first music video, which appeared on [[MTV]] and was created by Martin's youngest son, Ricci. On March 21, 1987, Martin's son, actor [[Dean Paul Martin]] (formerly Dino of the 1960s "[[teenybopper|teeny-bopper]]" rock group [[Dino, Desi & Billy]]), died when his [[F-4 Phantom II]] jet fighter crashed while flying with the [[California Air National Guard]]. Martin's grief over his son's death left him depressed and demoralized. Later, a tour with Davis and Sinatra in 1988, undertaken in part to help Martin recover, sputtered.<ref>{{cite news |last=Reed |first=J.D. |date=January 8, 1996 |title=Burden of Sorrow |url=https://people.com/archive/burden-of-sorrow-vol-45-no-1/ |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |access-date=December 26, 2016}}</ref>

Martin, who responded best to a club audience, felt lost in the huge stadiums they were performing in at Sinatra's insistence, and he was not interested in drinking until dawn after performances. His final Vegas shows were at Bally's Hotel in 1991. At Bally's, he had his final reunion with Lewis on his 72nd birthday. Martin's last two TV appearances involved tributes to his former [[Rat Pack]] members. On December 8, 1989, he joined stars in Sammy Davis Jr's 60th anniversary celebration, which aired a few weeks before Davis died from throat cancer. In December 1990, Martin congratulated Sinatra on his 75th birthday special.

==Personal life==
Martin was married three times. He wed Elizabeth Anne "Betty" McDonald, (July 14, 1922 – July 11, 1989) of Ridley Park, Pennsylvania in 1941. The couple had four children:{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=174}}

* Claudia Martin (March 16, 1944 – February 16, 2001).
* Gail Martin (born 1945)
* [[Deana Martin]] (born 1948)

Martin and McDonald divorced in 1949 and Dean gained custody of their children. McDonald lived out her life in relative obscurity in San Francisco, California.

Martin next married Dorothy Jean "Jeanne" Biegger (March 27, 1927 – August 24, 2016), a former [[Orange Bowl]] queen from [[Coral Gables, Florida]]. Their marriage lasted 24 years (1949–1973) and produced three children:{{sfn|Tosches|1992|p=546}}

==Tributes and legacy==
In 1997, [[Ohio Route 7]] through [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] was rededicated as Dean Martin Boulevard. Road signs bearing an [[Al Hirschfeld]] caricature of Martin's likeness designate the stretch with a historical marker bearing a small picture and brief biography in the Gazebo Park at Route 7 and North Fourth Street. An annual Dean Martin Festival celebration is held in Steubenville. Impersonators, friends and family, and entertainers, many of Italian ancestry, appear. In 2005, [[Clark County, Nevada]], renamed a portion of Industrial Road as Dean Martin Drive. A similarly named street was dedicated in 2008 in [[Rancho Mirage, California]]. Martin's family was presented a gold record in 2004 for ''[[Dino: The Essential Dean Martin]],'' his fastest-selling album, which also hit the iTunes Top 10, and in 2006 it was certified "Platinum".<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=DINO+-+THE+ESSENTIAL+DEAN+MARTIN#search_section| title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA| website=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]}}</ref>

For the week ending December 23, 2006, the Dean Martin and [[Martina McBride]] duet of "[[Baby, It's Cold Outside]]" reached No. 7 on the R&R AC chart. It also went to No. 36 on the R&R Country chart – the last time Martin had a song this high in the charts was in 1965, with the song "[[I Will (Dick Glasser song)|I Will]]," which reached No. 10 on the Pop chart. An album of duets, ''[[Forever Cool]]'', was released by Capitol/EMI in 2007. It features Martin's voice with [[Kevin Spacey]], [[Shelby Lynne]], [[Joss Stone]], [[Big Bad Voodoo Daddy]], [[Robbie Williams]], McBride and others. His footprints were immortalized at [[Grauman's Chinese Theatre]] in 1964. Martin has three stars on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]: one at 6519 Hollywood Boulevard for movies; the second at 1617 Vine for recordings; and a third at 6651 Hollywood Boulevard for television. In February 2009, Martin was honored with a posthumous [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. Four of his surviving children, Gail, Deana, Ricci and Gina accepted it on his behalf. In 2010, Martin received a posthumous star on the [[Italian Walk of Fame]] in [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.italianwalkoffame.com/inductees/inductees-2010/| title=Inductees 2010 - The Italian Walk of Fame| website=Italianwalkoffame.com| access-date=August 5, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421011115/http://www.italianwalkoffame.com/inductees/inductees-2010/| archive-date=April 21, 2019| url-status=dead}}</ref>
