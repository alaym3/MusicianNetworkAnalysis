'''Brian Hugh Warner''' (born January 5, 1969), known professionally as '''Marilyn Manson''', is an American singer, songwriter, actor, painter,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.101exhibit.com/exhibitions/marilyn-manson_1 |title=Marilyn Manson |website=101 Exhibit |date=November 4, 2008 |access-date=October 5, 2020 |archive-date=November 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201107223435/http://www.101exhibit.com/exhibitions/marilyn-manson_1 |url-status=live }}</ref> and writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genreisdead.com/book-review-marilyn-manson-by-perou/|title=Book Review: Marilyn Manson By Perou: 21 Years In Hell|website=Genre Is Dead|last=Perez Hollingsworth|first=Ashley|date=June 16, 2020|access-date=October 5, 2020|archive-date=September 26, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926103944/https://genreisdead.com/book-review-marilyn-manson-by-perou/|url-status=live}}</ref> He is known for his controversial stage personality and image as the lead singer of [[Marilyn Manson (band)|the band of the same name]], which he co-founded with guitarist [[Scott Putesky|Daisy Berkowitz]] in 1989 and of which he remains the only constant member. Like the other founding members of the band, his [[stage name]] was formed by combining and juxtaposing the names of two opposing American cultural icons: a [[sex symbol]] and an infamous criminal; in Manson's case, actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[cult]] leader [[Charles Manson]].

Manson is best known for music released in the 1990s, such as the albums ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' (1994), ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (1996) and ''[[Mechanical Animals]]'' (1998) which earned him a reputation in mainstream media as a controversial figure and negative influence on young people when combined with his public image.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marilyn Manson Concert Canceled |first=Glasgow |last=Greg |url=http://www.thedailycamera.com/shooting/23manson.html |format=[[Broadsheet]] |agency=[[MediaNews Group]] |newspaper=[[Camera (newspaper)|The Daily Camera]] |publisher=Albert J.

Manson has been ranked at No. 44 on the list of the "Top 100 Heavy Metal Vocalists" by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' and, along with his band, has been nominated for four [[Grammy Awards]]. Manson made his film debut as an actor in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (1997 film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997), and has since appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos. In 2002, his first art show, ''The Golden Age of Grotesque'', was held at the [[Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions]] center.

In 2021, multiple women accused Manson of psychologically and sexually abusing them, allegations he has denied.<ref name="BB Timeline" />

Warner and guitarist [[Scott Putesky|Scott "Daisy Berkowitz" Putesky]] formed [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson & the Spooky Kids]] following conversations at the Reunion Room in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], in 1989.<ref>{{cite web |title=Scott Mitchell Putesky (Daisy Berkowitz) Interview |url=http://www.blankmaninc.com/scott_mitchell_putesky |work=Blankmaninc.com |first=Lucky |last=Hawk |date=January 7, 2013 |access-date=January 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620141522/https://blankmaninc.com/scott_mitchell_putesky/ |archive-date=June 20, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The name was later shortened to Marilyn Manson. While with The Spooky Kids, Manson teamed with [[Jeordie White]] (also known as Twiggy Ramirez) and Stephen Gregory Bier Jr. (also known as [[Madonna Wayne Gacy]]) in two side-projects: Satan on Fire, a faux-[[Christian metal]] ensemble where he played bass guitar, and drums in Mrs. Scabtree, a collaborative band formed with White and then girlfriend [[Jessicka]] (vocalist with the band [[Jack Off Jill]]) as a way to combat contractual agreements that prohibited Marilyn Manson from playing in certain clubs.

In 1993, the band drew the attention of [[Trent Reznor]], who produced their 1994 debut album ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' and released it on his [[Nothing Records]] label. The band began to develop an audience, which grew larger on the Downward Spiral Tour that featured Nine Inch Nails and [[Jim Rose Circus]] along with the release of ''[[Smells Like Children]]'' in 1995. That EP yielded the band's first big MTV hit with "[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)]]", a cover of the 1983 [[Eurythmics]] hit. ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (co-produced by Trent Reznor) was an even greater success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.basetendencies.com/interview/GWDec96.html|title=Dangerous Creatures: Marilyn Manson have come for your Children|work=Guitar World.|date=December 1996|access-date=June 21, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070604180615/http://www.basetendencies.com/interview/GWDec96.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = June 4, 2007}}</ref>

In the U.S. alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded two platinum and three more went gold, and the band has had seven releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Manson first worked as a producer with the band [[Jack Off Jill]]. He helped name the band and produced most of the band's early recordings, and also played guitar on the song "My Cat" and had the band open most of his [[South Florida]] shows.<ref name="MTV1">{{cite web|url=http://www.marilynmansonimages.com/band-history5.html/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 6, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903023539/http://www.marilynmansonimages.com/band-history5.html/ |archive-date=September 3, 2011 }}</ref> Manson later wrote the [[liner notes]] to the band's album ''[[Humid Teenage Mediocrity 1992â€“1996]]'', a collection of early Jack Off Jill recordings.

He had been working on his directorial debut, ''Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll'', a project that has been in [[development hell]] since 2004, with Manson also set to portray the role of [[Lewis Carroll]], author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. Initially announced as a web-only release, it was later decided to give the estimated $4.2&nbsp;million budget film a conventional cinema release, with a slated release date of mid-2007.

Manson stated in a 2004 interview with ''[[i-D magazine]]'' to have begun his career as a [[watercolor]] painter in 1999 when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers.

Manson named his self-proclaimed [[art movement]] Celebritarian Corporation. He has coined a [[slogan]] for the movement: "We will sell our shadow to those who stand within it." In 2005 he said that the Celebritarian Corporation has been "incubating for seven years" which if correct would indicate that Celebritarian Corporation, in some form, started in 1998.<ref name="MTV News">{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512539/20051028/marilyn_manson.jhtml?headlines=true |title=Marilyn Manson Likens His New Guitar God to a Naked Woman |access-date=September 27, 2007 |publisher=MTV News |date=October 28, 2005 |author=Harris, Chris |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116185033/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512539/20051028/marilyn_manson.jhtml?headlines=true |archive-date=November 16, 2007 }}</ref> Celebritarian Corporation is also the namesake of an [[art gallery]] owned by Manson, called the ''Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art'' in Los Angeles for which his third exhibition was the inaugural show.

 |quote = Manson was a [[culture war]] agitator for ''our'' side, someone willing to jar and frighten the fuck out of the power structures that seemed there to keep teenagers in their place&nbsp;... and his tactics made him a target, both of mass-culture disdain and of superior alt-culture snark.

Manson has mentioned on at least two occasions that he trademarked the name Marilyn Manson. In an interview at the 2015 [[Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity|Cannes Lions Festival]], he said: "I trademarked the name 'Marilyn Manson' the same way as Walt Disney and Mickey Mouse.

Manson says he used those trademark registrations to issue [[cease and desist]] orders to media outlets who wrongly blamed him for the [[Columbine High School massacre]].

Manson generally uses the name in lieu of his birth name.

==Philanthropy==
Manson has supported various charitable causes throughout his career. In 2002, he worked with the [[Make-A-Wish Foundation]] to collaborate with a fan who had been diagnosed with a life-threatening illness. 16-year-old Andrew Baines from [[Tennessee]] was invited into the band's recording studio to record backing vocals for their then-upcoming album, ''[[The Golden Age of Grotesque]]''. Manson said on his website, "Yesterday, I spent the afternoon with Andrew, who reminded me the things I create are only made complete by those who enjoy them. I just want to simply say, thank you to Andrew for sharing such an important wish with me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marilyn-manson-makes-dying-fan-s-wish-come-true/ |title=Marilyn Manson Makes Dying Fan's Wish Come True |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 29, 2002 |access-date=October 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024025616/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marilyn-manson-makes-dying-fan-s-wish-come-true/ |archive-date=October 24, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/marilyn-manson-shows-his-softer-side-66313.html |title=Marilyn Manson shows his softer side |work=[[Irish Examiner]] |publisher=[[Landmark Media Investments]] |date=August 31, 2002 |access-date=October 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024030756/http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/entertainment/marilyn-manson-shows-his-softer-side-66313.html |archive-date=October 24, 2016 }}</ref> He contributed to [[Oxfam]]'s 2013 "Rumble in the Jumble" event, which raised money to aid victims of domestic and sexual abuse in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/marilyn-manson/news/celebrities-donate-items-to-charity-jumble-sale_3440561 |title=Marilyn Manson &#124; Celebrities Donate Items To Charity Jumble Sale |work=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=January 9, 2013 |access-date=October 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024023614/http://www.contactmusic.com/marilyn-manson/news/celebrities-donate-items-to-charity-jumble-sale_3440561 |archive-date=October 24, 2016 }}</ref> He has supported various organizations â€“ such as Music for Life and Little Kids Rock â€“ which enable access to musical instruments and education to children of low-income families.

{{cquote|"I'm not a misanthrope. I'm not a [[nihilist]]. I'm not an [[atheist]]. I believe in spirituality, but it really has to come from somewhere else.

If you take all the basic principles of any religion, it's usually about creation. There's also destruction, but creation essentially. I was raised Christian. I went to a Christian school, because my parents wanted me to get a better education. But when I got kicked out I was sent to public school, and got beat up more by the public school kids.
