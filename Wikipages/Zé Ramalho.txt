'''Zé Ramalho''' (born '''José Ramalho Neto''' on October 3, 1949 – [[Brejo do Cruz]] – [[Paraíba]], Brazil) is a Brazilian composer and performer. Zé Ramalho has collaborated with various major Brazilian musicians, including [[Vanusa]], [[Geraldo Azevedo]] and [[Alceu Valença]] to name a few. Zé Ramalho is also the first cousin of [[Elba Ramalho]], a well known Brazilian composer and performer.

As with many musicians back in his younger days, he was first influenced by rock and roll; however, at the age of 20, his music took a more Northeastern Brazilian approach. Zé Ramalho's lyrics however, are very influenced by the socio-economic difficulties faced by the average Brazilian.

== Biography ==

=== Early life: 1949–1974 ===
Zé Ramalho was born to Estelita Torres Ramalho, an elementary school teacher, and Antônio de Pádua Pordeus Ramalho, a [[Seresta]] performer. When he was two years old, his father drowned in a reservoir<ref name="globo cultura">{{cite news|last=Lichote|first=Leonardo|title=Zé Ramalho estreia gravadora própria e lança primeiro CD de inéditas desde 2007|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/cultura/ze-ramalho-estreia-gravadora-propria-lanca-primeiro-cd-de-ineditas-desde-2007-5289768|access-date=June 25, 2012|newspaper=[[O Globo]]|date=June 23, 2012|language=pt}}</ref><ref name="news at serafina">{{cite journal|last=Küchler|first=Adriana|title=Zé e o fim do mundo|journal=[[Folha de S.Paulo]]|date=June 24, 2012|series=Serafina|pages=26|trans-title=Zé and the end of the world|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=pt}}</ref> of the [[sertão]], and he was then adopted by his grandfather. His love for his grandfather would later be expressed in the song "Avôhai".<ref name="news at serafina"/> After spending most of his childhood in [[Campina Grande]], his family moved to [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]]. Ramalho went to medicine school at the [[Federal University of Paraíba]].<ref name="especialRSB1">{{cite web |last1=Souza |first1=Henrique Inglez de |title=Especial Zé Ramalho Parte I: Quando o brejo cruzou a poeira |url=https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/noticia/ze-ramalho-parte-i-quando-o-brejo-cruzou-poeira/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] Brasil |publisher=Grupo Perfil |access-date=26 January 2021 |language=Portuguese |date=5 October 2018}}</ref>

As soon as the family settled in João Pessoa, he took part of some [[Jovem Guarda]] performances, being influenced by [[Renato Barros]], [[Leno e Lílian]], [[Roberto Carlos (singer)|Roberto Carlos]] & [[Erasmo Carlos]], [[Golden Boys (band)|Golden Boys]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

In 1974, his first son, Christian, was born.

Before composing, he used to write [[Cordel literature]].<ref name=estrelas>{{cite web|author=Angelica|author-link1=Angélica (television host)|title=Zé Ramalho relembra infância em passeio no Parque das Ruínas|url=http://globotv.globo.com/t/programa/v/ze-ramalho-relembra-infancia-em-passeio-no-parque-das-ruinas/4266796/|website=[[Rede Globo]]|publisher=[[Grupo Globo]]|access-date=June 23, 2015|location=Rio de Janeiro|date=June 20, 2015}}</ref>

=== First works: 1974–1975 ===
Also in 1974, he performed for [[Tânia Quaresma]]'s movie ''Nordeste: Cordel, Repente e Canção'' soundtrack. At that time, he figured out a way to mix all the influences he received throughout his life: from Rock 'n' Roll to Forró. A year later, he recorded his first album, ''[[Paêbirú]]'' along with [[Lula Côrtes]] through the label [[Rozenblit]]. Today the copies from this very rare vinyl are highly priced in the international collector's market.

=== Beginning of the major musical career:1975–1984 ===
In 1976, he left medicine school and moved to Rio de Janeiro,<ref name=estrelas/> where he searched for a record label to release his first album. After being rejected by several producers and executives, he was finally accepted by [[Jairo Pires]], from [[CBS Records International|CBS]].<ref name="especialRSB1"/> In 1977, he recorded his second album (first solo), the self-titled ''[[Zé Ramalho (album)|Zé Ramalho]]''. A year later, his second son, Wilson, was born. In 1979, the third son, João (born to him and to his wife Amelinha), came along the third album, ''[[A Peleja do Diabo com o Dono do Céu]]'' (also referred to as ''Zé Ramalho II''). He then moved to [[Fortaleza]] in 1980, where he wrote and published his book "Carne de Pescoço" ("Neck Flesh"). The fourth album, ''[[A Terceira Lâmina]]'', was released afterwards, and the fifth one, ''[[Força Verde]]'', in 1982.

In 1983, he broke up with Amelinha. After releasing his sixth album, ''[[Orquídea Negra]]'', he got married with Roberta, Amelinha's cousin, in 1984.

=== Small declining: 1985–1990 ===
The mid eighties would witness a small decrease in Zé Ramalho's popularity, with the releases of the albums ''[[Pra Não Dizer Que Não Falei de Rock]]'' (or ''Por Aquelas Que Foram Bem Amadas'') (1984), ''[[De Gosto de Água e de Amigos]]'' (1985), ''[[Opus Visionário]]'' (1986) and ''[[Décimas de um Cantador]]'' (1987). In 1990, he performed in the United States for a Brazilian audience.

=== Back to the top: 1991–2001 ===
In 1991, his only sister, Goretti, died. Even though, he was able to record his eleventh album, ''[[Brasil Nordeste]]'', and returned to his success times with the recording of the song "Entre a Serpente e a Estrela" for the soapopera "Pedra Sobre Pedra". In 1992, his fifth son, José, was born, and he released the twelfth album ''[[Frevoador]]''. In 1995, he had his first daughter born: Linda.

In 1996, he recorded the album ''[[O Grande Encontro]]'' live with his cousin [[Elba Ramalho]] (who had already re-recorded a very successful version of his song "Chão de Giz") and the well known MPB names [[Alceu Valença]] and [[Geraldo Azevedo]]. In the same year, he released his thirteenth album ''[[Cidades e Lendas]]''. The success of "O Grande Encontro" was so great that he decided to record it again in 1997 at the studio, this time without Alceu Valença though. The record sold 300,000+ copies, going Gold and Platinum. To celebrate his 20 years of career, he released the CD ''[[Antologia Acústica|20 Anos – Antologia Acústica]]''. The record label [[Sony Music]] also released a [[box set]] containing three discs: one of rarities, one of duets and one of classics. Also to celebrate the 20 years, Brazilian author Luciane Alves released a book titled "Zé Ramalho – um Visionário do século XX" ("Zé Ramalho – a 20th Century Visionary").

Before the end of the millennium, another great hit: Admirável Gado Novo (first released in his second album in 1980) was the opening theme of the soap opera O Rei do Gado. He also released his fourteenth studio album, ''[[Eu Sou Todos Nós]]'', and the sixteenth one, [[Nação Nordestina]], in which he once again explored the music of his home land, the [[Nordeste]]. The album would later be a candidate for the Latin Grammy Award for Best Regional Music Album or of Brazilian Origins.

=== Continuing into the 3rd Millennium: 2001–2011 ===
His first work of the 21st Century was the release of ''[[Zé Ramalho canta Raul Seixas]]'', a [[cover album]] with songs by [[Raul Seixas]]. He then shared stage with Elba Ramalho in the [[Rock in Rio 3]]. In 2002, [[Som Livre]] releases a CD of his greatest hits, part of its "Perfil" series of Greatest Hits albums. Also in 2002, he released his seventeenth album, ''[[O Gosto da Criação]]''.

In 2003, he released his eighteenth album, ''[[Estação Brasil]]'', containing 19 recordings of his main Brazilian influences, and one new song. He guest appeared in the song Sinônimos ("Synonyms"), from [[Chitãozinho & Xororó]]'s album, ''Aqui o Sistema é Bruto'' ("Here, the system is Brutal").

In 2005, he recorded his only live album, simply titled ''[[Zé Ramalho ao vivo]]''. His latter album, ''[[Parceria dos Viajantes]]'', was recorded in 2007 and was nominated for the [[Latin Grammy Award]] for Best Brazilian Popular Music Album.<ref>[http://www.onorte.com.br/noticias/?68883 O Norte Online – Zé Ramalho disputa o Grammy 2007 de Melhor Álbum de MPB]</ref><ref>[http://www.univision.com/content/content.jhtml?cid=726868 Winners of the Latin Grammy Award]</ref>

In 2008, he released a compilation of rarities called ''[[Zé Ramalho da Paraíba]]'', followed by another cover album: ''[[Zé Ramalho canta Bob Dylan - Tá tudo mudando]]'', a tribute to the [[Bob Dylan|American musician]].

In 2009, a third cover album, ''[[Zé Ramalho Canta Luiz Gonzaga]]'', was released, paying tribute to the [[Luiz Gonzaga|Brazilian musician]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.entretendo.com/ze-ramalho-lanca-novo-cd-homenageando-luiz-gonzaga/|title=Zé Ramalho lança novo CD homenageando Luiz Gonzaga|last=Saura|first=Michele|date=May 20, 2009|publisher=Entretendo.com|language=pt|access-date=May 31, 2009}}</ref> In 2010 and 2011, respectively, he released two more tribute albums: ''[[Zé Ramalho Canta Jackson do Pandeiro]]'', in tribute to [[Jackson do Pandeiro]], and ''[[Zé Ramalho Canta Beatles]]'', in tribute to the [[Beatles]].

=== Own record label: 2012–present ===
In 2012, Zé Ramalho created his own record label, [[Avôhai Music]], through which he is releasing his first non-cover studio album since 2007: ''[[Sinais dos Tempos]]''.<ref name="globo cultura"/><ref name="news at serafina"/> In September 2013, Zé Ramalho performed at [[Rock in Rio#Rock in Rio 5|Rock in Rio]] with Brazilian thrash metal band [[Sepultura]] – the line-up was labeled as "Zépultura", a portmanteau of both artists' names.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dias|first1=Tiago|title=Zé Ramalho ganha prestígio no dia do metal e toca com "Zépultura" no Sunset 28|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2013/09/22/sepultura-ganha-tom-profetico-com-ze-ramalho-no-rock-in-rio.htm|website=[[Universo Online|UOL Música]]|publisher=[[Grupo Folha]]|access-date=November 30, 2014|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=pt|date=September 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Albuquerque|first1=Carlos|title=Crítica: Sepultura com Zé Ramalho dá certo e gera um fruto cantado pelo público: Zépultura|url=http://musica.uol.com.br/noticias/redacao/2013/09/22/sepultura-ganha-tom-profetico-com-ze-ramalho-no-rock-in-rio.htm|website=[[O Globo]]|publisher=[[Grupo Globo]]|access-date=November 30, 2014|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=pt|date=September 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Canônico|first1=Marco Aurélio|title=Rock in Rio 2013: 'Zépultura' domina o Palco Sunset|url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/ilustrada/2013/09/1345907-em-grande-encontro-sepultura-e-ze-ramalho-viram-zepultura.shtml|website=[[Veja (magazine)|Veja]]|publisher=[[Grupo Abril]]|access-date=November 30, 2014|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=pt|date=September 22, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=de Castro|first1=Yuri|title=Em grande encontro, Sepultura e Zé Ramalho viram 'Zépultura'|url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/entretenimento/rock-in-rio-2013-zepultura-domina-o-palco-sunset|website=[[Folha de S.
