In order to raise money for Puerto Rico's reconstruction after being struck by hurricanes [[Hurricane Irma|Irma]] and [[Hurricane Maria (2017)|María]], including at least $15&nbsp;million to be channeled through the Flamboyán Foundation, Lin-Manuel decided to take, and once again play the protagonist role in ''Hamilton'' to his father's native Puerto Rico. The Miranda family donated approximately $1&nbsp;million to bring the [[University of Puerto Rico]] theater up to par in order to use it as the venue for the musical's performance in January 2018. After tickets sold out in two hours for the three-week run, producers decided to move out of the university venue due to warnings of potential disruptions by a university workers' labor organization, and move the already-installed set to the [[Luis A. Ferré Performing Arts Center]] in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|Santurce]], where the performances ran from January 11 to January 27. The production donated additional hundreds of thousands of dollars in improvements to the Ferré Performing Arts Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elnuevodia.com/entretenimiento/musica/nota/agradecenalaproducciondehamiltonmejorasalcentrodebellasartes-2469237/ |title=Agradecen a la producción de "Hamilton" mejoras al Centro de Bellas Artes |website=Elnuevodia.com |date=January 5, 2019 |access-date=April 27, 2020}}</ref>

In 2016, Miranda advocated for the passing of the [[Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act]], a law setting out to restructure the debt of Puerto Rico following [[Hurricane Maria]].<ref name="Macht2016" /> The law led to budget cuts resulting in the closure of over 200 public schools, cuts to government labor benefits, and budget cuts at the [[University of Puerto Rico]] (UPR). It was met with protests, with UPR shutting down due to student strikes over the measures in 2017. Miranda became a target of criticism, especially when he performed ''Hamilton'' in Puerto Rico, given his lobbying on the bill as well as the musical's subject matter, which focused on the founding of Puerto Rico's [[History of Puerto Rico|colonizer, the United States]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 10, 2019|title=A Breakdown of the Controversy Surrounding Lin Manuel-Miranda & 'Hamilton' in Puerto Rico|url=https://remezcla.com/features/culture/lin-manuel-miranda-hamilton-in-puerto-rico-controversy/ |website=Remezcla |language=en-US |access-date=July 8, 2020}}</ref>
