{{Details|Kobe Bryant sexual assault case}}
In the aftermath of the [[2020 Calabasas helicopter crash|death]] of basketball player [[Kobe Bryant]] in January 2020, Wood was criticized for writing a message on [[Twitter]] hours after his death which said: "What happened is tragic. I am heartbroken for Kobe's family. He was a sports hero. He was also a rapist.
