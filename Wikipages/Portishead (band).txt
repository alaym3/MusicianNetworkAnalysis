'''Portishead''' is an English band formed in 1991 in [[Bristol]]. They are often considered one of the pioneers of [[trip hop]] music. The band is named after the nearby [[Portishead, Somerset|town of the same name]], eight miles west of Bristol, along the coast.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.46513,-2.684784&spn=0.096249,0.251999&z=12|title=Google Maps|website=Google Maps|access-date=3 November 2018}}</ref> Portishead consists of [[Beth Gibbons]], [[Geoff Barrow]] and [[Adrian Utley]], while sometimes citing a fourth member, Dave McDonald, an [[audio engineer|engineer]] on their first records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trht.net/artist/Dave+McDonald |title=The Rock Hard Times: Dave McDonald |website=Trht.net |access-date=4 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotinetti.suomi.net/heikki.hietala/dave.htm |title=A Portishead Fansite: Dave McDonald |website=Kotinetti.suomi.net |access-date=4 June 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612211850/http://kotinetti.suomi.net/heikki.hietala/dave.htm |archive-date=12 June 2011}}</ref>

Their debut album, ''[[Dummy (album)|Dummy]]'', was met with critical acclaim in 1994, quickly becoming a landmark album in the [[trip hop]] genre. Two other studio albums have been issued: ''[[Portishead (album)|Portishead]]'' in 1997 and ''[[Third (Portishead album)|Third]]'' in 2008, both of which received similar acclaim. In 1998, the band released a concert album, ''[[Roseland NYC Live]]''.

== History ==
=== ''Dummy'' (1994) ===
[[Geoff Barrow]] and [[Beth Gibbons]] met during a coffee break at an [[Enterprise Allowance Scheme|Enterprise Allowance]] course in February 1991.  That year they recorded their first song for the album, "It Could Be Sweet".<ref name=mojo>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YjJpGhYC1GsC&pg=PA610 |title=The Mojo Collection: The Ultimate Music Companion |page=610 |publisher=Canongate Books|date= 2007|isbn= 978-1841959733 }}</ref> They then met [[Adrian Utley]] while they were recording at the Coach House Studios in Bristol, and Utley heard the first song Barrow and Gibbons had recorded, and began to exchange ideas on music.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/24/portishead-dummy-wasnt-a-chillout-album-25th-anniversary-geoff-barrow-adrian-utley-beth-gibbons |title='Dummy wasn't a chillout album.

The cover features a still from the band's own short film ''[[To Kill a Dead Man]]''. The credits indicate that at this juncture, Portishead was a duo of [[Geoff Barrow]] and [[Beth Gibbons]]. Adrian Utley, who co-produced the album with them (and who played on nine of the tracks and co-wrote eight), became an official band member shortly after its release.

Despite the band's aversion to press coverage, the album was successful in both Europe and the United States (where it sold more than 150,000 copies even before the band toured there).<ref name="amg">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p45223|pure_url=yes}} Biography] ''AllMusic''.

=== ''Portishead'' (1997) ===
After their initial success, Portishead withdrew from the spotlight for three years until their second album, ''[[Portishead (album)|Portishead]]'', was released in 1997. The album's sound differed from ''Dummy'', characterised as "grainy and harsher."<ref>{{cite web|title=Portishead "Portishead"|url=http://www.qualityrecords.com.au/Portishead%20Portishead.html|publisher=Quality Records|access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref> Three singles, "[[All Mine (Portishead song)|All Mine]]", "[[Over (Portishead song)|Over]]" and "[[Only You (Portishead song)|Only You]]" were released, the first one achieving a Top 10 placing in the UK.<ref>

In 1997, the band performed a one-off show with [[String instrument|strings]] at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in New York City. A [[Roseland NYC Live|live album]] primarily featuring these new orchestral arrangements of the group's songs was released in 1998. There was also a long-form VHS video of the performance, and a DVD followed in 2002, with substantial extra material including many early music videos.

=== Hiatus (1999–2005) ===
In 1999, Portishead recorded the song "[[Sometimes I Feel Like a Motherless Child|Motherless Child]]" with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] for his album ''[[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]]''. For the next few years, the band members concentrated on solo and other pursuits. In February 2005, the band appeared live for the first time in seven years at the Tsunami Benefit Concert in Bristol.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2005/02/18/tsunami_views_feature.shtml Tsunami benefit concert review] BBC Music. Retrieved 5 January 2008</ref> Around that time, Barrow revealed that the band was in the process of writing its third album. In August 2006, the band posted two new tracks on its [[MySpace]] page (called "Key Bored 299 03" and "Greek Jam"), described by Barrow as "doodles".<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/comment/story/0,,1859997,00.html Quote from Geoff Barrow] ''[[The Guardian]]'' 29 August 2006. Retrieved 28 December 2007</ref> Around the same time, Portishead covered [[Serge Gainsbourg]]'s "Un Jour Comme un Autre (Requiem for Anna)" on the tribute album ''[[Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited]]''.

=== ''Third'' (2008) ===
On 2 October 2007, Portishead stated that the new album ''[[Third (Portishead album)|Third]]'' had been [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] and was nearly complete, and was due for release in early April 2008. The release was later pushed to 28 April. On 8 and 9 December 2007, the band curated the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in [[Minehead]], England.
