'''Neurosis''' is an American [[avant-garde metal]] band from [[Oakland, California]]. It was formed in 1985 by guitarist [[Scott Kelly (musician)|Scott Kelly]], bassist [[Dave Edwardson]], and drummer [[Jason Roeder]], initially as a [[hardcore punk]] band. Chad Salter joined as a second guitarist and appeared on the band's 1987 debut ''[[Pain of Mind]]'' before being replaced by [[Steve Von Till]] in 1989. The following year, the lineup further expanded to include a keyboardist and a visual artist. Beginning with their third album ''[[Souls at Zero]]'' (1992), Neurosis transformed their hardcore sound by incorporating diverse influences including [[doom metal]] and [[industrial music]], becoming a major force in the emergence of the [[post-metal]] and [[sludge metal]] genres.

The band's lineup stabilized in 1995 with the addition of [[Noah Landis]], who replaced Simon McIlroy on keyboards and electronics. That same year they formed the [[experimental music]] group [[Tribes of Neurot]] and in 1999 the record label [[Neurot Recordings]]. As of 2019, they have released 11 studio albums, garnering critical recognition. The [[BBC]] credited them with taking "heavy music to previously unimaginable spaces ... [and shaping] [[heavy metal music|metal]]'s definitive response to the 21st century."<ref name="bbc1" />

==History==
===Formation and early years (1985–1995)===
In late 1985, [[Scott Kelly (musician)|Scott Kelly]], [[Dave Edwardson]], and [[Jason Roeder]], formerly members of Violent Coercion, founded Neurosis as a hardcore punk outfit, inspired also by British [[crust punk]] in the vein of [[Amebix]]<ref name=Exclaim>{{cite web|last=Mikkelson|first=Jill|title=Neurosis Are Insulated|url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/neurosis_are_insulated|website=[[Exclaim.ca]]|access-date=May 26, 2013|date=July 2007}}</ref> and [[Crass]].

In 1986 Chad Salter was added on second guitar and vocals. There have only been a few changes in the lineup of Neurosis' musicians since band's inception. In 1989 guitarist/vocalist Chad Salter was replaced by [[Steve Von Till]], who previously played in bands Transgressor, Peace Test and Tribe of Resistance, and in 1990, Simon McIlroy joined the band as a synthesizer/sampler with Adam Kendall as visual artist (Adam and Simon have been friends since they were teenagers and they were doing a lot of experimental music together before).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2016/12/20/neurosis-outtakes-extended-interview-with-souls-at-zero-keyboardist-simon-mcilroy/|title=Neurosis Outtakes: Extended Interview with Souls At Zero Keyboardist Simon McIlroy|date=2016-12-20|website=Decibel Magazine|access-date=2017-08-30}}</ref> In 1995 [[Noah Landis]], a childhood friend of Dave Edwardson, replaced Simon McIlroy as keyboardist.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles.aspx?id=1-38|title=Neurotics Never Know: A Chat with Neurosis' Dave Edwardson|last=Bromley|first=Adrian|date=April 18, 1996|website=Chroniclesofchaos.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref>

With ''[[The Word as Law]]'', Neurosis began to transition<ref name="Quietus Look Back">{{cite magazine|last=Gardner|first=Noel|title=The Quietus Looks Back At The Career Of Dynamic Metallic Neurosis|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/02435-the-quietus-looks-back-at-the-career-of-dynamic-metallic-neurosis|magazine=[[The Quietus]]|access-date=May 26, 2013|date=August 10, 2009}}</ref> from the hardcore punk of ''[[Pain of Mind]]'' to the more experimental sound of ''[[Souls at Zero]]'', which would ultimately form the basis for [[post-metal]]<ref name="About SaZ">{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Justin M.|title=Neurosis - 'Souls At Zero'|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/neurosis/gr/Neurosis-Souls-At-Zero-Review.htm|website=[[About.com]]|access-date=May 26, 2013|quote=''Souls At Zero'' was a game-changing album, not just for Neurosis but for the entire metal genre.

Neurosis' signature sound came into full force with ''[[Enemy of the Sun]]'', with ''The Quietus'' observing that "at the time few could have predicted this black hole of agonizingly precise metal riffs, unnerving backmasking, industrial folkisms and extensive sampling".<ref name="Quietus Look Back" />

===''Through Silver in Blood'' to ''The Eye of Every Storm'' (1996–2004)===
In 1996, Neurosis attracted mainstream attention with its [[Relapse Records]] debut, ''[[Through Silver in Blood]]'' and subsequent tour with [[Pantera]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name="Spokesman">{{cite web|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/1997/jan/31/dose-of-neurosis-opening-for-pantera-on-monday/|title=Dose Of Neurosis Opening For Pantera On Monday|last=Ehrbar|first=Joe|date=January 31, 1997|website=Spokesman.com|access-date=January 23, 2012}}</ref> In 1999, Neurosis released [[Times of Grace (album)|''Times of Grace'']], which was designed to be played synchronously with ''[[Times of Grace (album)#Grace|Grace]]'', an album released by Neurosis' ambient side project, [[Tribes of Neurot]].

In the early 2000s, the band founded their own [[independent record label]], [[Neurot Recordings]], which, in addition to releasing material from Neurosis and its associated projects, signed several other artists.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/an-interview-w-11/|title=an interview w/ Scott Kelly (Neurosis, Neurot, Shrinebuilder)|date=April 22, 2009|website=BrooklynVegan.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref>

Beginning with ''[[A Sun That Never Sets]]'', Neurosis began incorporating clean vocals and acoustic instrumentation with a growing [[folk music]] influence, more noted presence of classical [[string instruments]] (which had been used sparsely since ''Souls At Zero'') as well as slower tempos and a more contemplative sound. [[Allmusic]] described this change as an "aesthetic sea change".<ref name="Allmusic ASTNS">{{cite web|last=Kennedy|first=Patrick|title=Neurosis: A Sun That Never Sets|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-sun-that-never-sets-mw0000007058|website=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=May 26, 2013}}</ref> 2004's ''[[The Eye of Every Storm]]'' expanded upon this change by incorporating more ambient textures into the mix and presenting a softer post-rock oriented sound.

===''Given to the Rising'', ''Honor Found in Decay'', '' Fires Within Fires'' (2007–present)===

The band entered the studio in December 2011 to record the follow-up to ''Given to the Rising''. The new album, entitled ''[[Honor Found in Decay]]'', was released in late October 2012.<ref name="Earsplit">{{cite web|url=http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/2012/08/13/neurosis-title-of-eleventh-full-length-from-musical-pioneers-revealed/|title=Neurosis: Title Of Tenth Full-Length From Musical Pioneers Revealed|date=August 13, 2012|website=Earsplitcompound.com|access-date=May 26, 2013}}</ref>

The band performed at Roadburn 2016, with Brooklyn Vegan's Ian Cory writing that "once the house lights came up it was hard to justify watching anything else."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/live-review-roadburn-2016-day-4/|title=Roadburn 2016 Day 4 review & pics (Blind Idiot God, Neurosis, Ecstatic Vision, more)|website=BrooklynVegan.com|access-date=May 27, 2016}}</ref> This was part of their series of shows performed in celebration of their 30th anniversary as a band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/neurosis-30th-anniversary-shows-sleep-shellac/|title=Neurosis Announce Special 30th Anniversary Shows|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=May 27, 2016}}</ref>

==Visuals==
From 1990 to 1993, Adam G. Kendall was recruited to create visuals and perform live with the band. Following his departure from touring, Pete Inc. took over the job, although Kendall continued to contribute visuals for the band until as late as 1997.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ram.org/music/articles/neurosisinterview.html|title=Interview with Scott Kelly of Neurosis|last=Samudrala|first=Ram|date=October 17, 2000|website=Ram.org|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref> Kendall also shot the footage for the "[[Locust Star]]" video.

Josh Graham took over live visuals in early 2000 as Pete wasn't "cutting the mustard" (in the words of Steve Von Till), and created album artwork for 2004's ''The Eye of Every Storm'', 2007's ''Given to the Rising'', and 2012's ''Honor Found in Decay'', as well as re-designs for the reissues of Souls at Zero and Enemy of the Sun.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/an-interview-wi-24/|title=An interview with Josh Graham (Neurosis, A Storm of Light)|website=BrooklynVegan.com|access-date=2016-11-21}}</ref> Graham and Neurosis amicably parted ways in late November 2012 via an announcement on the band website.<ref name="Blog New Chapter">{{cite web|url=http://officialneurosis.blogspot.com/2012/11/neurosis-begins-new-chapter.html|title=Neurosis Begins New Chapter|date=November 27, 2012|website=Officialneurosis.blogspot.com|access-date=May 26, 2013}}</ref> He was not replaced and the band ceased to use live visual media.

Often experimental and psychedelic in nature, Neurosis' visual media have added to the reputation of their live performances. Many of the visuals for their tours supporting ''[[Through Silver in Blood]]'' are taken from [[Ken Russell]]'s film ''[[Altered States]]''. Other images are included in the enhanced portion of the ''[[Sovereign (EP)|Sovereign]]'' EP, and on the ''[[A Sun That Never Sets]]'' DVD video release. The majority of the DVD release was directed by Graham, with an additional video by Chad Rullman.

==Musical style and influences==
Neurosis emerged as a [[hardcore punk]] band, performing a blend of hardcore and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] inspired by British [[punk rock|punk]]<ref name="guardian" /> and described as [[crust punk]]<ref name="chimes">{{cite web|title=Neurosis brings post-metal back to its roots|url=http://chimes.biola.edu/story/2016/sep/26/neurosis-brings-post-metal-back-its-roots/|last=Heilman|first=Maxwell|publisher=The Chimes|date=September 26, 2016|access-date=January 5, 2017}}</ref> or [[crossover thrash|crossover]].<ref name="bbc1" /> However, their second album ''[[The Word as Law]]'' (1990), introduced some elements of [[avant-garde music]] and [[sludge metal]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treblezine.com/31717-celebrate-catalog-neurosis-albums-rated/|title=Celebrate the Catalog: Neurosis|first=Jeff|last=Terich|website=Treblezine.com|date=September 12, 2016|access-date=March 29, 2017}}</ref> a genre which was emerging as a fusion of hardcore and [[doom metal]]. Thereafter, the band developed a unique sound; Greg Moffitt of the [[BBC]] wrote that through a "process of evolution and refinement" beginning with ''[[Souls at Zero]]'' (1992) and culminating in ''[[Through Silver in Blood]]'' (1996), they "[took] heavy music to previously unimaginable spaces and, in the process, shape[d] what has thus far been metal's definitive response to the 21st century."<ref name="bbc1" />

The style Neurosis pioneered has been named [[post-metal]],<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.avclub.com/article/beak-casts-post-metal-shadow-over-light-outside-207307 | title=Beak casts a post-metal shadow over "Light Outside" | newspaper=[[The A.V.
