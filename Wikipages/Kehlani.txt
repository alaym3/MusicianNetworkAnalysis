Early in her life, Kehlani aspired to train as a dancer at the [[Juilliard School]], but she had a knee injury in junior high, which led her to turn her attention towards singing.<ref name="ComplexInter" /> While living with her aunt, Kehlani was exposed almost exclusively to R&B and [[neo soul]] artists, such as [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Erykah Badu]] and [[Jill Scott]], whom today she describes as some of her early musical influences.<ref name="ComplexInter">{{cite news | last=Drake| first=David| title =Kehlani Talks About the Making of "Cloud 19," the Tutelage of Lauryn Hill, and Getting a Hand From Nick Cannon| work =[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=December 3, 2014 | url =http://www.complex.com/music/2014/12/kehlani-parrish-interview| access-date=November 30, 2015}}</ref> When she was 14, Kehlani was recruited to join a local pop cover band, Poplyfe.<ref name="FaderEarned" />

==Career==
=== 2009–2013: Beginnings with PopLyfe ===
Kehlani's singing career effectively began when she started out as a member and lead vocalist for the group called PopLyfe. The band's music was produced by former [[Tony! Toni!

In 2011, they auditioned for the [[America's Got Talent (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''America's Got Talent,'' and eventually finished in fourth place.

After the end of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', Kehlani left PopLyfe, because of several managerial and contractual disputes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2015/04/kehlani-complex-magazine-april-may-2015|title=Kehlani Discusses Shady Managers, Her Bisexuality, and Her Many Tattoos|website=Complex|access-date=May 10, 2017}}</ref> Over six months, she avoided doing anything music related to avoid being sued by the group's management.<ref name="ComplexWho" /> In 2012 and 2013, Kehlani was effectively homeless, moving from house to house and often sleeping on couches.<ref name="ComplexInter" /> During her senior year of high school, she moved to Los Angeles, California, with no legal guardian. In 2013, [[Nick Cannon]], who had been the host of ''America's Got Talent'' during PopLyfe's run, called Kehlani to ask her about being in a rap group. She agreed at first and went to Los Angeles, but, ultimately didn't like the direction of the group and moved back to Oakland. To help with money and food, she decided to begin stealing iPhones to sell, and items from grocery stores for a short time.<ref name="FaderEarned" /> Months later, Kehlani released her first solo track on [[SoundCloud]], called "ANTISUMMERLUV". Cannon called her back after hearing the song and he bought her an apartment in [[Los Angeles|LA]], along with studio time.<ref name="FaderEarned" /><ref name="ComplexInter" /><ref name="ComplexWho" />
