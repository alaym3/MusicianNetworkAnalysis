'''The Click Five''' (often abbreviated as '''TC5''')<ref name=invade/> was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The original members, most of them [[Higher education in the United States|students]] at [[Berklee College of Music]], started on January 1, 2004, and played in various local venues.<ref name=citypaper/> They then quickly got the attention of [[Artists and repertoire|talent scout]] Wayne Sharp (who had worked with the [[power pop]] group [[Candy (band)|Candy]]). The Click Five made their first recording, a two-song demo session, in early 2004 after successful local [[Tour (music)|touring]]. They released their debut album ''[[Greetings from Imrie House]]'' in 2005. After vocalist [[Eric Dill]] left the group, he was replaced by Kyle Patrick who debuted on their second album ''[[Modern Minds and Pastimes]]'' in 2007.<ref name=msn>{{cite web|first=Jason|last=Ankeny|url=http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/the-click-five/|publisher=[[MSN Music]]|access-date=December 21, 2009|title=The Click Five: Biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609120729/http://music.msn.com/music/artist-biography/the-click-five/|archive-date=June 9, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their third album, ''[[TCV (album)|TCV]]'', was released in Asia in 2010 and to the rest of the world in early 2011.

The band was initially known for its [[power pop]] songs and for its [[Mod (subculture)|Mod-based]] public image,<ref name=msn/> involving sharp-looking [[Suit (clothing)|suits]] and [[Necktie|ties]] coupled with [[Moptop|moptop haircuts]], which is deliberately reminiscent of [[The Beatles]] or The Dave Clark Five.<ref name=just>{{cite web|publisher=[[About.com]]|url=http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/cfivejtg.htm|first=Bill|last=Lamb|title=Just the Girl – Click Five|access-date=December 22, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090811092349/http://top40.about.com/od/singles/gr/cfivejtg.htm|archive-date=August 11, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> They prefer to classify their music as "[[Power pop|new school power pop]]".<ref name=take-five>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2005/08/07/take_five/|title=Take Five|work=The Boston Globe|date=August 7, 2005|access-date=December 22, 2009}}</ref> However, they have also been classified as [[pop punk]] and [[teen pop]].<ref name=fallen>{{cite news|work=The Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2009/03/07/catch_the_fallen_stars/|access-date=December 21, 2009|first=Joan|last=Anderman|date=March 7, 2009|title=Catch the fallen stars}}</ref><ref name=all-music-1/> They achieved significant commercial success with their first album in the US and their second release met with extreme popularity in Asian countries such as Cambodia and the Philippines.<ref name=manila>{{cite news|first=Cheryl|last=Tiu|title=Why Click Five clicks in Manila|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/vidvibe/view/20080603-140535/Why-Click-Five-clicks-in-Manila|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=June 3, 2008|access-date=December 23, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031035044/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/vidvibe/view/20080603-140535/Why-Click-Five-clicks-in-Manila|archive-date=October 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In total, the band has sold two million albums worldwide and have created eight number one [[Single (music)|singles]] in seven different nations.<ref name=z>{{cite web|access-date=December 23, 2009|title=The Click Five|url=http://www.z100.com/new2/artists/theclickfive|publisher=[[WHTZ|Z100 – New York City]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310015157/http://www.z100.com/new2/artists/theclickfive|archive-date=March 10, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The band starred in the 2007 film ''Taking Five'' with [[Alona Tal]], [[Daniella Monet]], and [[Christy Carlson Romano]].

==History==

===Formation and early history===
Ben Romans studied songwriting, Ethan Mentzer studied production and engineering, and Joey Zehr double majored in production/engineering and business at the [[Berklee College of Music]]. Roommates and close-friends Mentzer and Zehr moved to a place on Imrie Road in the neighborhood of [[Allston]] when they were both [[Sophomore year|sophomores]]. Calling their place "Imrie House", they met with Romans and Joe Guese (whom Zehr once described as a "[[Dropping out|professional dropout]]") and formed a kind of pseudo-[[fraternity]]. The four played in various local bands, none of which had any success.<ref name=citypaper>{{cite news|url=http://www.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=11329|title=Manifest Destiny|access-date=December 22, 2009|first=Mikael|last=Wood|date=January 11, 2006|work=[[Baltimore City Paper]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406194907/http://www2.citypaper.com/music/story.asp?id=11329|archive-date=April 6, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, they drew the attention of Wayne Sharp, a musical [[talent agent]] who had mostly worked in [[jazz]] although he had also worked with the mid-1980s [[power pop]] group [[Candy (band)|Candy]].<ref name=msn/> Early iterations of the band often also included studio musician Jude (Freebird) Jones until Dill's departure in 2007.

Romans went to work for a record company in Nashville. Jeff Dorenfeld, former manager of the band [[Boston (band)|Boston]], saw Guese and Mentzer performing in May 2003 and referred them to Sharp. Sharp liked their playing, but he had a low regard for their songs and their appearance. The first words Sharp ever said to them were "This isn't going to work unless you listen to me".<ref name=take-five/>

The four soon took in [[Eric Dill]], a high-school friend of Zehr from when they both lived in [[Indianapolis]]. Zehr has said that they began playing seriously because "[w]hen we started the band our senior year, it was basically our last-ditch effort, because we all knew we were about to be done with school and have to enter the real world".<ref name=citypaper/> They were all in their very early-20s.<ref name=greetings/> According to Zehr, the group would play several shows a week that were booked under different band names to get around local clubs' rules preventing artists from playing that close to each other.<ref name=citypaper/> Their playing then got the attention of Mike Denneen, Boston-based producer of [[Fountains of Wayne]], who agreed to help them produce a 2-song demo record. Denneen also introduced them to [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] guitarist [[Paul Stanley]], who was strongly supportive.<ref name=greetings/>

The Click Five made their demos at Imrie House itself,<ref name=citypaper/> finishing in March 2004. Denneen believed that the group "sucked live" and pushed them to rehearse further.<ref name=take-five/> The program director at Kiss 108, the big Boston Top 40 station, liked it enough to book the group for the station's "Concert on the Charles" in mid-2004.<ref name=citypaper/> The released their first EP, "Angel to You (Devil to Me)", around this time.<ref name=msn/> Principal songwriter Ben Romans collaborated with [[Paul Stanley]] in creating the song,<ref name=greetings/> and guitarist [[Elliot Easton]], best known for his work in [[The Cars]], played in it.<ref name=RS/>

The group hired a lawyer and shopped around some of the major labels. A college scout from [[Epic Records]] who witnessed one of their shows convinced Epic to fly the group to Los Angeles to play.<ref name=citypaper/> [[Lava Records]], which was later folded into [[Atlantic Records]], ended up signing the band in late 2004.<ref name=greetings>{{cite web|access-date=December 22, 2009|url=http://top40.about.com/od/albums/fr/click5greetings.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|title=Greetings From Imrie House – The Click Five|first=Bill|last=Lamb}}</ref> They started with the label a mere month after their EP. According to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', "Click Five was launched into the pop-music stratosphere with the full force of the industry's muscle behind it."<ref name=fallen/> The band [[opening act|opened]] for [[Ashlee Simpson]] for the first time, a position that cost the label $25,000 and that one of their officials later called "the best money we've spent".<ref name=take-five/>

The group ended up selling about 10,000 copies of the EP.<ref name=all-music-1>{{cite web|publisher=Allmusic|first=John D.|last=Luerssen|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r781891|pure_url=yes}}|title=Greetings From Imrie House|access-date=December 22, 2009}}</ref> They then released "Just the Girl", written by label-mate [[Adam Schlesinger]] of [[Fountains of Wayne]], to build up support for their debut album. They also [[tour (music)|toured]] extensively with [[Ashlee Simpson]].<ref name=greetings/> They released their debut, [[Greetings From Imrie House]], on August 8, 2005, which they named after the building where they had started. It featured another song by [[Adam Schlesinger|Schlesinger]] titled "I'll Take My Chances", in which [[Elliot Easton]] also played.<ref name=ALL-about/> The album also contained a cover version of "[[Lies (Thompson Twins song)|Lies]]" – a song which was a hit for UK pop band [[Thompson Twins]] in 1983.

===Commercial and critical peak===
[[File:TheClickFive.jpg|thumb|250px|Click Five photographed in studio in late 2005]]

The album brought widespread commercial success, selling 350,000 copies in the United States.<ref name=fallen/> It took the fifteenth place on the Billboard 200 Charts almost immediately.<ref name=manila/> According to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', they "saturated" the media in several Asian countries as well, such as in Cambodia. Amy Doyle, then-MTV vice president, remarked that "I see screaming girls in their future. I see them having to wear disguises". Many stores stocked various Click Five-based items such as [[lunchbox]]es, [[backpacks]], [[trading cards]], and [[hair gel]] lines.<ref name=fallen/> The band spent late 2005 and early 2006 as the [[opening act]] for [[Ashlee Simpson]], [[Alanis Morissette]], the [[Backstreet Boys]], and [[Jesse McCartney]] as well as touring both by itself and in collaboration with [[Big City Rock]].<ref name=ALL-about/> They also performed at [[Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade]] in November 2005, singing "Catch Your Wave".<ref>{{cite web|date=November 22, 2005|publisher=[[Atlantic Records]]|title=THE CLICK FIVE THROW THE BOOK AT ITUNES|access-date=December 23, 2009 |url=http://www.atlanticrecords.com/news/article/?articleId=atlnewsarticle33800002}}</ref>

Their album turned out as that year's highest-charting debut from a new rock group.<ref name=manila/> They created a music video for "[[Just the Girl]]" in summer 2005, and it went up to number three on MTV's program ''[[Total Request Live]]''.<ref name=take-five/> The song became the No.&nbsp;1 most-downloaded song on [[iTunes]] for over 2&nbsp;weeks, leading to a [[RIAA certification|RIAA platinum certification]] as a [[Digital Single]].

''[[Greetings from Imrie House]]'' gathered positive reviews from [[About.com]], where critic Bill Lamb labeled it "a free fall into the world of irresistible melody and guitar-soaked power chords",<ref name=greetings/> and from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', where critic Gary Susman called it "insanely catchy".<ref name=EW>{{cite news|first=Gary|last=Susman|date=August 15, 2005|title=Greetings from Imrie House (2005) |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1092700,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|access-date=December 22, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' also ran a supportive review from Barry Walters, who stated that the "relentlessly catchy" album featured "several hit-worthy tracks".<ref name=RS>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theclickfive/albums/album/7548544/review/7563352/greetings_from_imrie_house |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413153924/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theclickfive/albums/album/7548544/review/7563352/greetings_from_imrie_house |archive-date=April 13, 2009 |url-status=dead |date=August 25, 2005 |access-date=February 22, 2020 |title=The Click Five: Greetings From Imrie House |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Barry |last=Walters}}</ref> Critics at ''[[USA Today]]'' and [[IGN.com]] panned the album, the former stating that listeners will be left "craving something more".<ref name=USA>{{cite news|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2005-08-22-listen-up_x.htm|first=Edna|last=Gundersen|date=August 22, 2005 |title='Greetings' from Click Five; 'Meteors' via Veirs|access-date=December 22, 2009}}</ref><ref name=IGN>{{cite web|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/652/652145p1.html|title=The Click Five – The House of Imrie|publisher=[[IGN.com]]|first=W.|last=Fry|date=September 19, 2005|access-date=December 22, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090625015057/http://music.ign.com/articles/652/652145p1.html|archive-date=June 25, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Throughout, members saw manager Wayne Sharp as an amiable influence. Producer Mike Denneen said, "He's not a dictator; he's a consensus builder, and he's very good at it... He cajoles and persuades and convinces and everybody is inclined to trust him, including me." However, band members expressed concern that they started out too fast and that they intentionally brought on too much media attention.<ref name=take-five/> Members also experienced increasing dissatisfaction with their label. Zehr said, "It's not like the old days, where a label would spend years pumping money to develop an artist... Today it's up to the artists to ready themselves for the big time". He commented as well, "At this point you're kind of turning the label into a bank".<ref name=citypaper/>

===Later career and recent history===
Through 2006, interest in the band gradually faded.<ref name=fallen/> Their songs did not have the chart success that the members had expected. [[Allmusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] has remarked that the band's music "didn't quite stick in the brain".<ref name=modern>{{cite web|publisher=Allmusic|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1075176|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Click Five – Modern Minds and Pastimes|author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|access-date=December 23, 2009|author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> Bassist Ethan Mentzer later said, "There was a point where it felt like we were in an airplane and the engines just died... It was a long, slow glide down."<ref name=fallen/> The band went on touring locally in venues such as Hot Stove and Cool Music.<ref name=part>{{cite news|date=March 12, 2007|access-date=December 22, 2009|title=The Click Five and Dill part ways|work=The Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/celebrity/articles/2007/03/12/the_click_five_and_dill_part_ways/}}</ref>

Lead singer [[Eric Dill]] left the band in February 2007.<ref name=arjan>{{cite web|url=http://www.arjanwrites.com/arjanwrites/2007/08/interview-with-.html|publisher=arjanwrites.com|title=Interview with Kyle Patrick of The Click Five|access-date=December 23, 2009|date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> The remaining four members released an official statement on the departure in March on their MySpace page, stating that "We know he will be missed by many and we wish him the best success in his other endeavors".<ref name=part/> They brought on new lead singer [[Kyle Patrick]], whom they had met in November 2006. Patrick had been in his third year at the [[Berklee College of Music]] and left in the middle of his studies to join The Click Five as Lead Vocalist/Rhythm Guitarist. He had been performing since age 11, citing [[Eric Clapton]] and his bands [[Derek & The Dominos]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]], [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] & [[James Taylor]] as his main influences.

Click Five spent early 2007 undergoing a reboot of their musical style, emphasizing [[New wave music|new wave]] and deliberately [[retro]] influences with more use of synthesizers. They appeared to be emulating successful [[alternative rock]] groups [[The Killers]] and [[Weezer]], according to [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine]].<ref name=modern/> The band also gave up wearing matching outfits and changed to having each member adopt their own modified visual image. When playing songs originally sung by Eric Dill live, they lowered the keys a whole step to suit Kyle Patrick's deeper voice.

The band narrowed down the about eighty songs that they had been working on down to twelve and then recorded their second album, ''[[Modern Minds and Pastimes]]''.  The title was a reference to [[Ray Charles]]' 1962 album "Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[Atlantic Records]]|title=The Click Five|access-date=December 23, 2009|url=http://www.atlanticrecords.com/theclickfive|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081116061707/http://www.atlanticrecords.com/theclickfive|archive-date=November 16, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It was released on June 26, 2007.<ref name=modern/> Despite high hopes, the album failed to meet commercial expectations, with only 50,000 copies sold in the U.S.<ref name=fallen/> It reached number 136 on the Billboard 200 chart.<ref name=charts>{{cite web|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=December 26, 2009|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p704011|pure_url=yes}}|title=The Click Five – Charts and Awards}}</ref> The album also earned mixed reviews from [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine|Erlewine]], which stated that "it's hard not to be disappointed", and Adrienne Day of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', which called the lyrics "banal" and the overall album as lacking "punch".<ref name=modern/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20045031,00.html|date=July 6, 2007|title=Modern Minds and Pastimes (2007)|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Adrienne|last=Day|access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> Chad Grischow of [[IGN.com]] labeled it "unfortunately uneven", although he also remarked that it was "worth a listen".<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[IGN.com]]|title=The Click Five – Modern Minds And Pastimes Review|date=July 27, 2007|access-date=December 23, 2009|first=Chad|last=Grischow|url=http://music.ign.com/articles/808/808828p1.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604004123/http://music.ign.com/articles/808/808828p1.html|archive-date=June 4, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The album spawned the single "Jenny" (co- written by [[Farrah (band)|Jez Ashurst]] and [[Chris Braide]]), which reached the number one spot in charts in Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, and Taiwan.

On August 2, 2008, Click Five won the "Knockout Award" at [[MTV Asia Awards 2008]], in [[Genting Highlands]], Malaysia. The award, for "the artist who has successfully captured the hearts of young music audiences in Asia", was a surprise to the band.<ref>{{cite web|work=MTV|title=2008 MTV Asia Awards Honors The Best From The East And West In March 2009|date=August 2, 2008}}</ref> Through 2008 and early 2009, the band played in various smaller, more niche-based venues in the [[New England]] area around this time.

In March 2009, Mike Denneen said, "Atlantic was unwilling to let them become a 'real' band, which is what the guys wanted. Now they're calling the shots and having the opportunity to do what most bands do at the beginning: play and write songs and develop." The band spent the month playing in various local locations such as the Lizard Lounge in Boston. They represented a big change for the Lounge, which was used to hosting [[alternative rock]] and [[indie rock]] acts.<ref name=fallen/> Ben Romans stated that month that a self-financed new album would be coming soon. The band released two new songs, "I Quit! I Quit! I Quit!" and "Be in Love", available as free singles online.<ref name=z/>
On August 6, 2010, they released their new single ''The Way It Goes'' with a record to follow the same year.

On November 13, 2010, they announced on their Twitter that their third album, entitled ''[[TCV (album)|TCV]]'', will be released exclusively in Asia on November 16, 2010. Their album will be released in the UK through [[Lojinx]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lojinx.com/releases/the-click-five/tcv|title=the click five - tcv, the album, buy the gatefold cd or digital download|work=Lojinx|access-date=October 23, 2014}}</ref> and in the US on Q Dee Records, May 2011.

===Break-up===
The Click Five announced January 14, 2013, on their Facebook page that they have officially parted ways. They stated that they were parting ways so that they may continue to focus on their individual endeavors after a long hiatus and thanked all their fans for supporting them throughout the years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musichel.com/2013/01/15/the-click-five-call-it-quits/|title=The Click Five Call It Quits|work=Musichel|access-date=October 23, 2014}}</ref>

''[[The Boston Globe]]'' referred to their image as "fluffy teen-dream pinups". Mentzer, although defending their image, admitted that the band was perceived as "[[Cool (aesthetic)|uncool]]".<ref name=fallen/>
