'''Juice''' is a [[drink]] made from the extraction or [[Cold-pressed juice|pressing]] of the natural [[liquid]] contained in [[fruit]] and [[vegetable]]s. It can also refer to liquids that are flavored with [[concentrate]] or other biological food sources, such as [[meat]] or [[seafood]], such as [[clam juice]]. Juice is commonly consumed as a [[beverage]] or used as an ingredient or flavoring in foods or other beverages, as for [[smoothie]]s. Juice emerged as a popular beverage choice after the development of [[pasteurization]] methods enabled its preservation without using [[fermentation]] (which is used in [[wine]] production).<ref name="bepress.com">{{cite web|url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&context=ryan_ward |format=PDF |title=A Brief History of Fruit and Vegetable Juice Regulation in the United States |author=Ryan A.

==Etymology==
[[File:Néctar smoothie before.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fruit juice being used in the preparation of a [[smoothie]]]]
The word "juice" comes from Old French in about 1300; it developed from the Old French words "''jus, juis, jouis''", which mean "liquid obtained by boiling herbs".<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&search=juice |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |access-date=26 January 2017}}</ref> The "Old French ''jus'' "juice, sap, liquid" (13c.)...[came] from Latin ''ius'' [which means] "broth, sauce, juice, soup," from PIE root *''yeue''- "to blend, mix food" (cognates: Sanskrit ''yus''- "broth," Greek ''zyme'' "a leaven", Old Church Slavonic ''jucha'' "broth, soup," {{lang-ru|уха}} "''[[ukha]]''", {{lang-lt|juse}} "fish soup")."<ref name="etymonline.com"/> The use of the word "juice" to mean "the watery part of fruits or vegetables" was first recorded in the early 14th century.<ref name="etymonline.com"/> Since the 19th century, the term "juice" has also been used in a [[#Figurative uses|figurative sense]] (e.g., to mean alcohol or electricity). Today, "''[[au jus]]''" refers to meat served along with its own juice, commonly as a [[gravy]].

==Preparation==
[[File:Afghan pomegranates getting washed.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Pomegranates getting washed prior to processing in an Afghanistan fruit concentrate factory.]]
Juice is prepared by mechanically squeezing or [[Maceration (food)|macerating]] (sometimes referred to as cold pressed<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/08/juicer-types-cold-press_n_2618000.html |title=Juicer Types: The Difference Between Cold Press Juicers vs. Centrifugal Juice Extractors |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2013-02-08 |access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref>) fruit or vegetable flesh without the application of heat or solvents. For example, [[orange juice]] is the liquid extract of the fruit of the [[orange (fruit)|orange]] tree, and [[tomato juice]] is the liquid that results from pressing the fruit of the [[tomato plant]]. Juice may be prepared in the home from fresh fruit and vegetables using a variety of hand or electric [[juicer]]s. Many commercial juices are [[Filtration|filtered]] to remove fiber or [[Juice vesicles|pulp]], but high-pulp fresh orange juice is a popular beverage. Additives are put in some juices, such as sugar and artificial flavours (in some fruit juice-based beverages); savoury seasonings (e.g., in [[Clamato]] or [[Caesar (cocktail)|Caesar]] tomato juice drinks). Common methods for preservation and processing of fruit juices include [[canning]], [[pasteurization]], [[concentrate|concentrating]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Understanding Concentrated Juice|url=http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/understanding-concentrate-juice.html|website=Fitday}}</ref> [[freezing]], [[evaporation]] and [[spray drying]].

Although processing methods vary between juices, the general processing method of juices includes:<ref name="sspindia.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.sspindia.com/fruit-juice-processing.html |title=Fruit Juice Processing, Fruit Juice Powder Plant, Fruit Juice Processing Plant, Juice Powder Plant |work=sspindia.com |access-date=7 May 2015}}</ref>
* Washing and sorting food source
* Juice [[extraction (chemistry)|extraction]]
* Straining, [[filtration]] and [[clarification (water treatment)|clarification]]
* Blending pasteurization
* Filling, sealing and sterilization
* Cooling, labeling and packing

After the fruits are picked and washed, the juice is extracted by one of two automated methods. In the first method, two metal cups with sharp metal tubes on the bottom cup come together, removing the [[peel (fruit)|peel]] and forcing the flesh of the fruit through the metal tube. The juice of the fruit, then escapes through small holes in the tube. The peels can then be used further, and are washed to remove [[oil]]s, which are reclaimed later for usage. The second method requires the fruits to be cut in half before being subjected to [[reamers]], which extract the juice.<ref name="madehow.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.madehow.com/Volume-4/Orange-Juice.html |title=How orange juice is made - production process, making, used, processing, product, industry, Raw Materials, The Manufacturing Process of orange juice, Byproducts/Waste, Quality Control |work=madehow.com |access-date=7 May 2015}}</ref>

After the juice is filtered, it may be concentrated in [[Climbing and Falling Film Plate Evaporator|evaporators]], which reduce the size of juice by a factor of 5, making it easier to transport and increasing its [[Shelf life|expiration date]]. Juices are concentrated by heating under a [[vacuum]] to remove water, and then cooling to around 13 degrees Celsius. About two thirds of the water in a juice is removed.<ref name="sspindia.com"/> The juice is then later reconstituted, in which the concentrate is mixed with water and other factors to return any lost flavor from the concentrating process. Juices can also be sold in a concentrated state, in which the consumer adds water to the concentrated juice as preparation.<ref name="madehow.com"/>

Juices are then pasteurized and filled into containers, often while still hot. If the juice is poured into a container while hot, it is cooled as quickly as possible. Packages that cannot stand heat require sterile conditions for filling. Chemicals such as [[hydrogen peroxide]] can be used to sterilize containers.<ref name="madehow.com"/> Plants can make anywhere from 1 to 20 tonnes a day.<ref name="sspindia.com"/>

High intensity pulsed electric fields are being used as an alternative to heat pasteurization in fruit juices. Heat treatments sometimes fail to make a quality, microbiological stable product.<ref name="Toepfl et al 2007">{{cite journal |last1=Toepfl |first1=S. |last2=Heinz |first2=V. |last3=Knorr |first3=D. |title=High intensity pulsed electric fields applied for food preservation |journal=Chemical Engineering and Processing: Process Intensification |date=June 2007 |volume=46 |issue=6 |pages=537–546 |doi=10.1016/j.cep.2006.07.011 }}</ref> However, it was found that processing with high intensity pulsed electric fields (PEF) can be applied to fruit juices to provide a shelf-stable and safe product.<ref name="Toepfl et al 2007" /> In addition, it was found that pulsed electric fields provide a fresh-like and high nutrition value product.<ref name="Toepfl et al 2007" /> Pulsed electric field processing is a type of nonthermal method for [[food preservation]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Advances in Food Process Engineering Research and Applications |publisher=Springer |doi=10.1007/978-1-4614-7906-2 |series=Food Engineering Series |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-4614-7905-5 |s2cid=113436343 }}</ref>

Pulsed electric fields use short pulses of electricity to inactivate microbes. In addition, the use of PEF results in minimal detrimental effects on the quality of the food. Pulse electric fields kill microorganisms and provide better maintenance of the original colour, flavour, and nutritional value of the food as compared to heat treatments. This method of preservation works by placing two electrodes between liquid juices then applying high voltage pulses for microseconds to milliseconds.The high voltage pulses are of intensity in the range of 10 to 80 kV/cm.

Processing time of the juice is calculated by multiplying the number of pulses with the effective pulse duration. The high voltage of the pulses produce an electric field that results in microbial inactivation that may be present in the juice. The PEF temperatures are below that of the temperatures used in thermal processing. After the high voltage treatment, the juice is aseptically packaged and refrigerated. Juice is also able to transfer electricity due to the presence of several ions from the processing. When the electric field is applied to the juice, electric currents are then able to flow into the liquid juice and transferred around due to the charged molecules in the juice. Therefore, pulsed electric fields are able to inactivate microorganisms, extend shelf life, and reduce enzymatic activity of the juice while maintaining similar quality as the original, fresh pressed juice.

==Terminology==

In the [[United Kingdom]], the name or names of the fruit followed by ''juice'' can only legally be used to describe a product which is 100% fruit juice, as required by the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/fruijuicedraftreg.pdf |title=Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (England) Regulations |access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref> and the Fruit Juices and Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fruit Juices & Fruit Nectars (Scotland) Regulations 2003|url=http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/draftssifruitjuice.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316084032/http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/draftssifruitjuice.pdf|archive-date=March 16, 2006|access-date=2014-08-25}}</ref> However, a juice made by reconstituting concentrate can be called juice. A product described as fruit "nectar" must contain at least 25% to 50% juice, depending on the fruit. A juice or nectar including concentrate must state that it does. The term "juice drink" is not defined in the Regulations and can be used to describe any drink which includes juice, whatever the amount.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.health78.com/health-news/Parents-beware-juice-in-juice-drinks-costs-up-to-34-per-litre/5454/ |title=Parents beware: Juice in juice drinks costs up to £34 $10 per litre! |publisher=Health78.com |access-date=2014-08-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009094011/http://www.health78.com/health-news/Parents-beware-juice-in-juice-drinks-costs-up-to-34-per-litre/5454/ |archive-date=2014-10-09 }}</ref> Comparable rules apply in all EU member states in their respective languages.

Depending on trends and regulations, beverages listed as ''100% juice'' may actually contain unlisted [[food additive|additives]]. For example, most orange juice contains added [[ethyl butyrate]] (to enhance flavor), vitamin C (as ascorbic acid), and water (if from concentrate). When fruit juice is too sour, acidic, or rich to consume, it may be diluted with water and sugar to create an ''[[ade (drink suffix)|-ade]]'' (such as lemonade, limeade, cherryade, and orangeade). The 'ade' suffix may also refer to any sweetened, fruit-flavored drink, whether or not it actually contains any juice.

A juice bar is an establishment that primarily serves prepared juice beverages such as freshly squeezed or extracted fruit juices, juice blends, fruit [[smoothies]] (a thick fruit drink, often iced), or other juices such as fresh [[wheatgrass]] juice. Sometimes other solid ingredients or nutritional supplements may be added as boosters, such as fresh [[Cavendish banana|bananas]], [[Nut (fruit)|nuts]] or [[nut butter]], [[bodybuilding supplements]], [[soy protein]] powder or others such as [[whey]] or [[hemp]] protein powders, [[wheat germ]], or [[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|spirulina]] or [[chlorella]]. Also if less juice is used with these same ingredients drinks called [[health shake]]s may be produced.

Juice bars share some of the characteristics of a [[coffeehouse]], a [[soda fountain]], a [[café]], and a [[snack bar]], such as providing blended drinks and food, such as sandwiches. Juice bars may be standalone businesses in cities or located at gyms, along [[commuter]] areas, near lunchtime areas, at beaches, and at tourist attractions. In [[Mexico]], juice bars have become more popular in the 2000s. [[Mexican juice bar]]s often also sell healthy beverages and snacks.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

==History==
Groups of grape pits dated to 8000 BCE show early evidence of juice production; although it is thought that the grapes may have been alternatively used to produce [[wine]].{{fact|date=March 2021}} One of the first regularly produced juices was [[lemonade]], appearing in 16th-century Italy, as an import, after its conception in the Middle East. Orange juice originated in the 17th century. In the 18th century, [[James Lind]] linked citrus fruits to the prevention of [[scurvy]], which, a century later, led to the implementation of the Merchant Shipping Act of 1867, requiring all ocean-bound British ships to carry citrus-based juice on board.{{fact|date=March 2021}}

In 1869, a dentist by the name of Thomas B. Welch developed a pasteurization method that allowed for the storage of juice, without the juice fermenting into [[ethanol|alcohol]]. His method involved filtering squeezed grape juice into bottles, sealing them with [[cork (material)|cork]] and [[wax]], and then placing them in boiling water. This method kills the [[yeast]] responsible for fermentation. He then sold his new product as "Dr Welch's Unfermented Wine".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Justin R. |title=Factors Influencing Grape Juice Quality |journal=HortTechnology |volume=8 |issue=4 |date=October 1998 |pages=471–478 |doi=10.21273/HORTTECH.8.4.471 |doi-access=free }}</ref> In the late 18th-century United States, circulation of foreign fruit juices were heavily regulated by [[tariff]]s. The [[McKinley Tariff]] Act of 1890 increased import taxes from 38 to 49.5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink. Juices with 18% or less alcohol were taxed 60 cents per gallon, while anything above 18% was taxed US$2.50 per proof gallon.<ref name="bepress.com"/>
