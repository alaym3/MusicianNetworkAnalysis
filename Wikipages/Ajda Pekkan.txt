She is known by the title "Superstar"<ref name="Süperstar"/> in the Turkish media.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.haber7.com/haber/20091221/Ajda-Pekkan-New-York-Timeste.php/|title=Ajda Pekkan New York Times'te|work=Haber 7|access-date=2 July 2010|date=21 December 2009}}</ref> Pekkan became a prominent figure of [[Turkish pop music]] with her songs, in which she tried to create a strong female figure. By keeping her works updated and getting influence from Western elements, she managed to become one of Turkey's modern and enduring icons in different periods.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.haber7.com/kultur/haber/217646-ajda-pekkan-batililasmanin-en-onemli-figuru |title = Ajda Pekkan batılılaşmanın en önemli figürü}}</ref> Her musical style has kept her popular for more than 50 years and has inspired many of her successors. Pekkan is highly respected in the music industry and her vocal techniques together with many of her albums were praised by [[Music journalism|music critics]].

Born in [[Beyoğlu]], [[Istanbul]], Pekkan's musical career began in the early 1960s when she appeared in a nightclub as a member of the music group Los Çatikos. However, in 1963, when she won the ''Ses'' magazine's cinema artist competition, she became known as an actress, and for a number of years she pursued an acting career. In the same year, she played the leading role in her first film ''Adanalı Tayfur'' and became one of the young faces of [[Cinema of Turkey|Turkish cinema]] at the time. Over the next six years, she starred in nearly 50 black and white films, including ''Şıpsevdi'' (1963), ''Hızır Dede'' (1964) and ''Şaka ile Karışık'' (1965). She eventually quit acting and focused entirely on her singing career.

Pekkan spent the first twenty years of her singing career with dozens of songs released as [[cover versions]]. These songs, which were generally written by [[Fikret Şeneş]] and included "Kimler Geldi Kimler Geçti", "Palavra Palavra", "Sana Neler Edeceğim", "Hoş Gör Sen", "Sana Ne Kime Ne", "[[I Will Survive#Other cover versions|Bambaşka Biri]]", "Uykusuz Her Gece" and "O Benim Dünyam", later took their place among the best known songs of both Pekkan's career and the Turkish pop music genre. From the 1990s onwards, she worked with various songwriters and arrangers, including [[Şehrazat]] and [[Sezen Aksu]]. During this period, many of her songs such as "Yaz Yaz Yaz", "Sarıl Bana", "Eğlen Güzelim", "Vitrin", "Aynen Öyle" and "Yakar Geçerim" ranked among the best songs on Turkey's music charts.

Her fame grew steadily throughout the 1970s outside her home country, and particularly in Europe, and it was reinforced by concerts in different countries. She also recorded [[Pour Lui (Ajda Pekkan album)|a French album]] in 1978. Due to her increasing popularity, Pekkan was viewed as a potential candidate to represent [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980]] and she reluctantly accepted to participate in the contest. Disappointed that her song "[[Pet'r Oil]]" ranked fifteenth in the contest, she decided to take a break from her career for a few years.

By selling over 15 million records, Ajda Pekkan is one of the best-selling artists of all time in Turkey. She also holds the title of "[[State Artist (Turkey)|State Artist]]" in Turkey and has been awarded the honorary distinction of [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Officier of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government.<ref name="arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com">{{cite news|url=http://arsiv.ntvmsnbc.com/news/18508.asp|title=Sanatçılar unvansız kaldı|author=Evin Doğu|date=19 July 2000|access-date=7 December 2013|work=NTV-MSNBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aa.com.tr/tr/kultur-sanat/ajda-pekkana-sanat-ve-edebiyat-sovalyelik-nisani/207301|title=Ajda Pekkan'a sanat ve edebiyat şövalyelik nişanı|work=[[Anadolu Agency]]|date=2013-11-01}}</ref> Three of her albums were included in the list of the Best 100 Albums of Turkey by ''[[Hürriyet]]'' newspaper.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/kelebek/keyif/turkiyenin-en-iyi-100-albumu-40434983 | title=Türkiye'nin en iyi 100 albümü}}</ref> In 2016, Pekkan's name appeared in ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s [[Power 100]], a list of the 100 most powerful women in entertainment.

In 1963, at a singing and acting competition organized by ''Ses'' magazine named "Ses Sinema Artisti Yarışması", Pekkan ranked first in women's category<ref name="ilk yıllar">{{cite web | url = http://www.turknostalji.com/haber/sahnedeki-ilk-gunleri-7-ajda-pekkan-801.html | title = Sahnedeki ilk günleri (7) Ajda Pekkan | date = 8 March 2014 | access-date = 10 June 2014 | work = Türk Nostalji | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150410042108/http://www.turknostalji.com/haber/sahnedeki-ilk-gunleri-7-ajda-pekkan-801.html | archive-date = 10 April 2015 | url-status = dead }}</ref> followed by [[Hülya Koçyiğit]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.sacitaslan.com/magazin-ajda-tarihe-gecti_11582.html?arama=artist/ | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120908123156/http://www.sacitaslan.com/magazin-ajda-tarihe-gecti_11582.html?arama=artist/ | url-status = dead | archive-date = 8 September 2012 | title = Ajda tarihe geçti | publisher = Sacit Aslan | access-date = 24 June 2010 }}</ref> By winning the competition and with her modern style,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Gunaydin/Magazin/2010/04/22/zamana_karsi_bir_fotografajda/|title=Zamana karşı bir fotoğraf: Ajda|work=Sabah|access-date=24 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425074314/http://www.sabah.com.tr/Gunaydin/Magazin/2010/04/22/zamana_karsi_bir_fotografajda|archive-date=25 April 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> she started to attract attention.

{{rquote|right|I am very happy with the Ajda Pekkan brand that I have brought up to this day. But that's because I stood behind it, if it weren't me it wouldn't have come to this place.

Before starting her acting career, she met Fecri Ebcioğlu, who helped her through her music career and in 1965 arranged Pekkan's first record ''Her Yerde Kar Var'', which is the Turkish version of the song [[Tombe la neige]] by [[Salvatore Adamo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/cumartesi/11458643_p.asp/|title=Bu da müzikseverlerin seçimi|work=Hürriyet|access-date=2 July 2010}}</ref>

Throughout the 1960s, Pekkan and Ebcioğlu collaborated on numerous records, where Ebcioğlu would write the Turkish lyrics for popular French, Italian or English songs and Pekkan would sing them in her own unique style. In 1967, her record ''[[İki Yabancı]]'', which is the Turkish version of the song [[Strangers in the Night]] by [[Frank Sinatra]], broke the sales records in Turkey.

She represented Turkey at the International Apollonia Music Festival in [[Athens]], where she performed the songs "Ozleyis" and "Perhaps One Day" in 1968 and 1969, respectively. She also represented Turkey in 1969 at the Mediterranean Song Festival in [[Barcelona]], performing the song "Ve Ben Şimdi". Her songs have been used on the soundtracks of many films throughout the 1960s. She also began to perform with [[Zeki Müren]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://gnctrkcll.turkcell.com.tr/muzik/sanatci/ajda-pekkan-31/ | title = Ajda Pekkan | work = Turkcell | access-date = 2 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090709162542/http://gnctrkcll.turkcell.com.tr/muzik/sanatci/ajda-pekkan-31 | archive-date = 2009-07-09 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===1970s onwards===

By the beginning of the 1970s, she had stopped working with Fecri Ebcioğlu and started to work with Fikret Şeneş. Their first collaboration, Sensiz Yillarda, broke another sales record in Turkey. This song was released under Philips label, whom had signed her a year earlier. This would also be the turning point of Pekkan's career, where she would start releasing records at countries outside of Turkey. The first two 45 RPMs she released with Philips label, "Sensiz Yıllarda/Olmadı Gitti"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.discogs.com/Ajda-Pekkan-Sensiz-Y%C4%B1llarda-Olmad%C4%B1-Gitti/master/1042921 | title = Sensiz Yillarda - Olmadi Gitti, Philips, 1970}}</ref> and "Yağmur/Tek Yaşanır mı"<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.discogs.com/Ajda-Pekkan-Ya%C4%9Fmur-Tek-Ya%C5%9Fan%C4%B1r-M%C4%B1/master/1036391 | title = Yagmur - Tek Yasanirmi, Philips, 1970}}</ref> were also recorded in Greek and released in Greece.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.discogs.com/Ajda-Pekkan-%CE%86%CE%BB%CE%BB%CE%B7-%CE%94%CE%B5%CE%BD-%CE%98%CE%B1-%CE%92%CF%81%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82-%CE%8C%CF%80%CF%89%CF%82-%CE%95%CE%BC%CE%AD%CE%BD%CE%B1-%CE%97-%CE%91%CE%B3%CE%AC%CF%80%CE%B7-%CE%9C-%CE%86%CF%86%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B5/release/4725119

It has been said by Nino Varon that the song "Kimler Geldi Kimler Geçti" is the most meaningful song ever written in the Turkish.<ref name="ilk yıllar"/>

Pekkan collected her songs from all previous records, except the one published by Istanbul Plak in 1972, and put them in her first compilation album ''Ajda'', which was published in July 1975. A new song, "Erkek Adın", was also included in the album as well. The album received interest.

Pekkan, who was known as "Superstar" by 1977, published her new album ''Süperstar'' with different cover designs and production. In the same year, she performed the song "A Mes Amours" at [[Yamaha Music Festival]] in [[Tokyo]]. Pekkan gave a concert in [[Tehran]] at that time and this concert was broadcast on television and well received by the Turkish audience.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://turkpopmuzik.net/modules.php?name=Artists&op=content&tid=62/ | title = Sanatçılar: Ajda Pekkan - Türk Pop Müzik | access-date = 8 July 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140714185739/http://turkpopmuzik.net/modules.php?name=Artists&op=content&tid=62%2F | archive-date = 14 July 2014 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Pekkan's increasing popularity outside her own country and in Europe, created a public desire for her to [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1980|represent Turkey]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980]] and fix the country's general image following its poor performances in the contest in the previous years.<ref>{{cite video|title=''"ARŞİV ODASI: Ajda Pekkan, 1996"''|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0H33UK9tERA|publisher=[[BBC Türkçe]].

After "Pet'r Oil", the singer ended her contract with [[Philips Records]] and signed a new one with Yaşar Kekeva Plak.
