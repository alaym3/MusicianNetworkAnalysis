==History==
=== Early career ===
Harrison Mills and Clayton Knight met during their freshman year at [[Western Washington University]]. The two did not share the same educational interests. Knight studied physics and mathematics while Mills studied graphic design.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = ODESZA Makes Electronic Music so Damn Well, I'm Upset|website=Noisey.vice.com|url = http://noisey.vice.com/blog/odesza-makes-electronic-music-so-damn-well-im-upset|access-date = 2015-08-21}}</ref> They did not begin collaborating musically until their senior year in 2012 after befriending their early influence into music, DJ Maul-IE.<ref name="Odesza - Interview">{{cite web|url=http://lostinsound.org/odesza-interview/|title=Odesza - Interview |website=LostInSound.org|access-date=March 10, 2014}}</ref> As a child, Knight was classically trained in piano and later learned guitar.<ref name="Odesza - Interview" />

==== Name ====
The band's name is taken from the name of Mills' uncle's sunken vessel, which was named after the Ukrainian city of [[Odessa]]. Only his uncle and one other crew mate survived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacanvas.com/qa-odesza/|title=Interview: ODESZA|website=Lacanvas.com|access-date=March 10, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310234039/http://www.lacanvas.com/qa-odesza/|archive-date=March 10, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Since the spelling "Odessa" was already being used by a Scottish synth band, they instead chose to use a form of the Hungarian spelling, [[Sz (digraph)#Hungarian|replacing the "ss" with "sz"]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicninja.com/tmn-interview-odesza-the-boys-talk-about-their-pretty-music-and-why-it-sits-well-with-so-many/|title=Odesza - Interview |website=TheMusicNinja.com|access-date=April 9, 2014}}</ref> The correct spelling in Hungarian is: Odessza.

Individually Mills is known as Catacombkid, and Knight is known as BeachesBeaches. In reference to how Mills got his nickname, he says, "I got into [[Aesop Rock]] and he has a song called 'Catacomb Kids.' I thought it sounded cool."<ref name=":0"/> On the other hand, the story behind Knight's nickname, he says, "Honestly I was high in my bedroom making music one day…"<ref name=":0"/>
