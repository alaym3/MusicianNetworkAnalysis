==Early life and career==

===1980s===
[[File:Lucero_muy_moderna_hace_unos_años.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lucero]]
Lucero is the daughter of Lucero León and Antonio Hogaza.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0524456/bio|title=Lucero}}</ref>

Her career began in 1980. When she was young, she had concerns about being an artist, but at aged 10 [[Televisa]] offered her the opportunity to appear in a juvenile theme program named ''[[Alegrías De Mediodía]]'' (''Midday Happiness''), next to several children and young talents in music and comedy, like [[Aida Pierce]] and [[Aleks Syntek]].

She combined work with academic studies, also taking singing and dancing lessons. At that time she also performed in the program ''[[Juguemos a Cantar]]'' (''Let's play to sing''), in which she was the interpreter of the theme. Following these opportunities, she received several offers in different programs, among them ''[[Chiquilladas]]'' (''Childishness''), making her first starring appearance in the series for children, where one of her more popular roles was in a [[Popeye]] skit as [[Olive Oyl]].

In 1982, she starred her first [[telenovela]], ''[[Chispita (telenovela)|Chispita]]'' ("Little Spark"), alternating with great actors such as [[Enrique Lizalde]], [[Angélica Aragón]], among others. Her acting brought her 2 awards, her first [[Premios TVyNovelas|TVyNovelas Award]] and ''Azteca de Oro Award''. From that moment her career was seen as a promising future; curiously enough with the emergence of Lucero as a singer, she did not record the theme song for this telenovela. Instead that task was given to ''[[Timbiriche]]'', the most popular juvenile group in Mexico. This is how [[Raúl Velasco]] invited her to conduct and interpret the main theme of the musical pageant ''[[América, Esta Es Tu Canción]]''. In 1982, she released her first album, with [[Musart Records]], ''[[El (album)|Te Prometo]]'' (''I promise you'').<ref name="MEX Cert2">{{cite web|url=http://www.todo-music.com/info-sobre-lucero-216|title=Datos de Lucero|publisher=Todo Music|access-date=12 October 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108114439/http://www.todo-music.com/info-sobre-lucero-216|archive-date=8 November 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1983, she was hired by [[Daniel Galindo]] for her first film called ''[[Coqueta (1983 film)|Coqueta]]'' (''Coquette''), which she shared credit with [[Pedrito Fernández]], making her big screen debut. After almost two years, in 1984, Lucerito released her second album named ''[[Con Tan Pocos Años]]''. In this year, she was contacted again by the director [[Sergio Vejar]] to act in the movie ''[[Delincuente]]'' (''Delinquent''), since the film ''Coqueta'' was a big success in Mexico and Central and South America.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The following year, 1985, she was contacted to perform in her third film ''[[Fiebre de Amor (film)|Fiebre de Amor]]'' (Eng: ''Love Fever'') along with one of the most sought-after male singer of the decade, [[Luis Miguel]]. This combination was a complete success with the audience and the film received two Diosa de la Plata Awards, including Breakthrough Performance for Lucerito.<ref name="Pecime"/>

She participated in the [[Fiebre de amor (album)|soundtrack]] with two songs, and due to the favourable outcome of the film, the soundtrack also had a special edition for Italy. In this same year, at the suggestion of her mother, Lucerito left her mentor from the first two albums, Sergio Andrade, as the gossip began to grow that he had fallen in love with her. To avoid problems, the music company decided to release another album, but this time without the guidance of Sergio Andrade. Instead she was provided with different producers and composers, among them [[Joan Sebastian]] and [[Jaime Sánchez Rosaldo]].<ref name="Sergio">{{cite web|url=http://cancionesdesergioandrade.wordpress.com/2011/05/13/contigo-llevame-cuando-me-quieras-y-otras-canciones-de-amor-de-lucerito-que-le-compuso-sergio-andrade|title=Canciones de Sergio Andrade|publisher=Sergio Andrade}}</ref>

The album was titled ''[[Fuego y Ternura]]'' (''Fire and Tenderness'') later known as ''Magia''; the album managed good sales in Mexico and United States, reaching platinum status in Mexico. For this album she achieved two recognitions for Best Singer, TVyNovelas Award and El Heraldo Award. This album was a change in style, opting for more teen-oriented pop music. With this record, she gained her first real hit with ''Fuego y Ternura'', written by the singer-songwriter Prisma.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

During this year, Lucerito was hired by Adventure Kingdom to perform two songs for the whale [[Keiko (orca)|Keiko]] in a single called "[[Keiko (song)|Keiko]]". To make matters better, she was hired by [[PepsiCo International]]; in 1985 Pepsico found in Lucerito the most recognized youth image, so they chose her to be the spokesperson for their drink [[Mirinda]]. The focus of this campaign was only for Mexico.<ref name="Campañas">{{cite web|url=http://www.lucero.com.mx/trayectoria/campanas.html|title=Campañas|publisher=Lucero Hogaza}}</ref> She made a special appearance in one episode of the series ''[[Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1986, she recorded ''[[Un Pedacito De Mí]]'' (Eng: ''A little piece of me''), her fourth and last album with Musart Records. In order to get away from the shadow of Sergio Andrade's management, she signed to [[Fonovisa Records|Melody Records]] the same year. Due to the departure of the singer to another company, Musart did not promote this album, which resulted with sales lower than her previous albums. Her single "Era la primera vez" (Eng: ''It was the first time''), was a hit in Mexican charts reaching the top 10 and the top 20 in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=lucerito|chart=all}}|title=Latin Songs|work=Billboard}}</ref> In 1986, she was also cast in her first theatre role, in the play ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'', playing Doña Inés de Ulloa.

In 1987, Lucerito was offered her fourth film part with the director [[René Cardona Jr.]]. The movie was known as ''[[Escápate Conmigo]]'' (Eng: ''Escape with me''). She worked alongside her now ex-husband, but then friend [[Manuel Mijares]] and the comedian [[Jorge Ortiz de Pinedo]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} The film enjoyed moderate success, and due to this Melody Records released the soundtrack as ''[[Escápate Conmigo (soundtrack)|Escápate Conmigo]]''. Of note is that although Mijares was a well-known singer, he was not involved in the recording of any new song for the album. This production was the first one with Melody Records, as a prelude to her next album.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In 1988 she released ''[[Ocho Quince|Lucerito]]'' (later re-released as ''Ocho Quince''), her first Melody Records album. The album was a huge success and brought her to the realms of Mexican pop music where she now competed with teen pop acts at the time such as [[Timbiriche]], [[Sasha Sokol]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Tatiana (singer)|Tatiana]], [[Chayanne]], [[Karina (Venezuelan singer)|Karina]] and [[Flans]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

From this album she released several tracks, and the songs "Millones mejor que tú" (Eng: ''Millions better than you''), "Vete con ella" (Eng: ''Go away with her'’ the Spanish version of Chapel of Love) and "Tu amiga fiel" (Eng: ''Your faithful friend'') established her as a solid pop singer. The album achieved substantial sales in Costa Rica, Chile, Colombia, Venezuela, Guatemala and the US, which Lucero later visited to promote her album. Sales in Mexico reach the gold status.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amprofon.com.mx/certificaciones.php?item=menuCert&contenido=criterios|title=Certificaciones|publisher=Amprofon}}</ref> The album gave her a Galardón a los Grandes award for Best Singer. During this year, she decided to star in her fifth film, ''[[Quisiera Ser Hombre]]'' (''I wish I were a man''), starring next to [[Eduardo Capetillo]] and [[Carlos Riquelme]]. Critics thought this film helped indirectly to create tolerance towards homosexuality and transvestism in teenagers.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

Ending the decade, she established herself as one of the best singers in Latin America and the United States. She continued her ascent in her career, now releasing her sixth studio album ''[[Cuéntame (Lucerito album)|Cuéntame]]''. The sales of the album reached gold and platinum status in Mexico. This album opened the U.S. market, Spain, also across borders in Central America, in countries like [[Guatemala]], [[Costa Rica]], [[Honduras]], [[Panama]] and all South America. The title single achieved great success, becoming a number 1 hit in Mexico, Costa Rica, Colombia, Guatemala among other countries. The same song was included in [[VH1]] list "Best 100 Songs of the '80s in Spanish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fathersfate.com.mx/wordpress/2008/03/22/las-100-mejores-canciones-de-los-80s-en-espanol-segun-vh1/|title=100 Mejores canciones de los 1980s en español segun VH1|publisher=Johnny Cash|access-date=3 February 2018}}</ref>

This disc was the last album she released under the name ''Lucerito''. During this year, [[Procter & Gamble]] saw in Lucero one of the most famous and best cared-for hair styles and hired her to be the central image of the [[Head & Shoulders]] shampoo campaign for Latin America.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot2fooGljJQ|title=Lucero comercial Head & shoulders|via=YouTube}}</ref>

===1990s – from ''Rancheras'' to ''Piel de Ángel''===
[[File:Lucero_Hogaza.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lucero]]
Lucero left the 1980s with a solid career in which she was recognized as one of the best singers of the decade.

In this new album, the hits "Tácticas de Guerra", "Toda La Noche" and "Quiero" made her a favorite of the public and earned her a gold disc and platinum for her high sales in Mexico and the United States.

In 1997, Lucero married the singer Manuel Mijares. They had two children. The wedding was called "the event of the year" and it was broadcast through [[Televisa]] to Latin America.

In October 1997, she was invited to sing to the Pope [[John Paul II]] during the [[Pope John Paul II#Youth|II World Meeting of Families]] in the [[Maracanã (stadium)|Maracana stadium]] in Rio de Janeiro. The opportunity was, in Lucero's own words, the most emotional experience of her spiritual life and professional.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/travels/sub_index/trav_rio-de-janeiro-1997_sp.htm|title=II Encuentro Mundial|publisher=The Holy See}}</ref>

[[File:14-02-2011_Concierto_de_Lucero.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Lucero in 2011]]

The new millennium started with new contracts to Lucero. In early 2000, Lucero and singer [[Chayanne]] were employed by [[PepsiCo]] to promote [[Doritos]] and [[Pepsi]] products. They did together a TV spot and several ads that were promoted throughout the Latino community in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KTGjb1F6jc|title=Lucero Doritos|via=YouTube}}</ref> Also during this year, [[AT&T]] signed a contract with Lucero to be the main face to offer special rates for long-distance calls to Latino families in the United States, where she sang in several spots the number of the area code. In 2002 and 2003, the contract remained in force, so the company had printed some ads with her image that were published throughout the United States, and for private concerts.<ref name="Campañas" />

In 2000, she recorded the album [[Mi destino]] (''Eng: My Destiny'') for the company [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music International]], with this album Lucero shows a wide range of rhythms and sounds as the disc is produced by three world-renowned producers, Rafael Perez Botija who has produced figures as [[José José]] and [[Rocío Dúrcal]] to name a few, [[Ric Wake]] who has worked with [[Mariah Carey]] and [[Celine Dion]] among others, and Jimmy Greco who has also produced great figures like [[Coco Lee]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jimmy-greco-p287989/songs|title=Jimmy Greco|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> so she surprises with 2 songs in English with an outstanding quality and interpretation.

[[File:LuceroHogazaLeon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Billboard at the Latin Music Awards in 2011]]
In early 2003, Lucero was invited by PepsiCo to be the main image of the new product [[Sabritas]] for Mexico. With only three TV spots and ads the company managed to sell more than expected, so Lucero was recognized with an award and was invited to be the image of the 60 anniversary of Sabritas, singing the official jingle ''A Que No Puedes Comer Sólo Una'' (''You can't eat just one'').<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDNFz5v6zwo|title=Anuncio Sabritas|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Throughout 2003, she starred in the musical adaptation of the book by [[Antonio Velasco Piña]], a musical that tells another version of what happened on 2 October 1968, in [[Tlatelolco massacre|Tlatelolco]]. Lucero decided to take this play since she rejected to participate in the telenovela [[Amor real]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=41437&tabla=espectaculos|title=Lucero se convierte en "Regina"|publisher=El Universal|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615061853/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=41437&tabla=espectaculos|archive-date=15 June 2011}}</ref> Several months in theaters made her win an award for best actress in a musical and offered 100 performances with 100 standing ovations from the audience. Critics and reporters who were reportedly hostile to the actress created a situation whereby, when the plaque for the 100th performance was shown, television reporters insisted on having an interview with the actress and tried to follow her, only to have a security guard draw his gun against them. She defended the acts of her guard which led to her being removed from hosting the annual Telethon for several years.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

In August 2003, she was back to film sets to perform the role of Esperanza Alcalá in one of the most ambitious projects of Mexican cinema, ''[[Zapata: El sueño de un héroe]]'' (''Eng: Zapata: The dream of a hero'') by [[Alfonso Arau]]; starring [[Alejandro Fernández]] and photography by Vittorio Storaro who has to his credits 3 [[Academy Award|Oscars]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp;jsessionid=782E1A97A636337BC02030B8DE40F45B?curTime=1328121730260|title=Vittorio Storaro|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences}}</ref> art direction and costumes by [[Eugenio Zanetti]] who has also been awarded an Oscar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1328121873450|title=Eugenio Zanetti|publisher=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120719045953/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1328121873450|archive-date=19 July 2012}}</ref> She participated in the [[Zapata: El sueño del héroe (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the movie with one song named ''Quédate en mí'' (''Eng: Stay in me'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/zapata-el-sueo-del-hroe-r689475|title=Zapata: El Sueño del Héroe|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> In the fall of 2003, she signed a contract and start with Fuller Cosmetics to promote her own perfume.

[[File:Lucero_in_2017.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lucero in 2017.]]
In 2004, it was released [[Cuando Sale Un Lucero]] (''Eng: When a star comes out'') under the company of [[EMI]] Music Mexico, a new ranchera album with the production again of Ruben Fuentes and Homero Patrón; with the singles ''Entre La Espada y La Pared'' and ''Vete Por Donde Llegaste'' achieved gold record and release a special edition. That same year she returns to telenovelas, now with a relevant part in [[Alborada (telenovela)|Alborada]] (''Eng: Dawn'') where the story takes place in the 1800s and where she played María Hipólita Díaz alongside [[Fernando Colunga]], [[Daniela Romo]], and more. They achieve top position in the audience.

After her role in this soap opera that lasted until 2005, Lucero began to record her next album in early 2006. She released [[Quiéreme Tal Como Soy]] (''Eng.: Love Me As I Am'') in September 2006, where she pays tribute to Rafael Pérez Botija, the composer and producer of her biggest hits. With this record she achieved strong sales thanks to the singles ''La Única Que Te Entiende'' (''Eng: The One who understands you'') y ''O Tú O Nada'' (''Eng: Either you or nothing''). In November 2006, she hosted for the first time the [[Latin Grammy Awards of 2006|7th Latin Grammy ceremony]], since then she has participated as a host five times so far. As a result of the good sales of ''Quiéreme tal como soy'', the company decided to make a [[Lucero En Vivo Auditorio Nacional|concert]] in the [[National Auditorium]] in March 2007, recording an album completely live that achieved high sales on CD and DVD formats. This was her second and last live album to be released to the public.

On 20 October 2008, the telenovela ''[[Mañana es para siempre]]'' (''Eng: Tomorrow Is Forever'') was released and produced by Nicandro Diaz. This soap opera had a primetime broadcast where Lucero starred Barbara Greco, the villain of the trama; this was her second antagonist role since her well-received character María Paula in ''Lazos de Amor'' in 1996. She shared credits alongside great actors such as [[Silvia Navarro]], [[Fernando Colunga]] and Sergio Sendel. The ratings were high and reached 51 points in his final chapter with a special two-hour duration. Due to the popularity and credibility, Procter & Gamble invited Lucero to be the face and spokesperson for the line of creams and [[Olay]] beauty products. In this way, year after year the cosmetics company has renewed its contract with the actress and singer, even getting the image of [[Pantene]] shampoo in 2011.<ref name="Campañas" />
During mid-2008 there was controversy, the singer Lucero filed a lawsuit against the [[Universal Music Latin Entertainment|Universal Music]] label at not receiving royalties for sales of some of her albums in the last 14 years, albums recorded with Melody Records from Fonovisa, now part of Universal. Melody Records had agreed in 1998 to pay what they owed and never paid off the debt.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.peopleenespanol.com/article/lucero-demanda-universal-music|title=Lucero Albums|work=People}}</ref> Lucero and the company reached an undisclosed financial agreement on the debt of the old company.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/notas/682211-lucero-demanda-a-la-disquera--universal-music|title=Lucero Albums|publisher=Panamerica.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416061059/http://www.panamaamerica.com.pa/notas/682211-lucero-demanda-a-la-disquera--universal-music|archive-date=16 April 2013}}</ref>
[[Enrique Peña Nieto]], governor of the [[State of Mexico]] in 2008, chooses Lucero to be the official spokesperson of the achievements that his government have met over the months. With the response from people, she renewed the contract to remain the face in 2009.<ref name="Campañas" /> After finishing the contract, she was called to participate in the Spanish version of the album [[Yanni Voices|Voces]] (''Eng: Voices'') of the Greek composer [[Yanni]], where it was released the single "Eterno Es Este Amor" (''Eng: Eternal is this love'').
