'''Keith Matthew Thornton''' (born October 7, 1963), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Kool Keith''', is an American [[rapper]] and [[record producer]] from [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] known for his surreal, abstract and often profane or incomprehensible lyrics. Kool Keith has recorded prolifically both as a solo artist and in group collaborations. Kool Keith is generally considered to be one of hip-hop's most eccentric and unusual personalities.<ref name=Grantland>{{cite web|last1=Barshad|first1=Amos|title=Kool Keith Is Lost in His Own Space|url=http://grantland.com/features/rap-greatest-weirdo-kool-keith-works-be-last-album/|website=www.grantland.com|access-date=11 October 2014}}</ref>

Kool Keith was a cofounding member of [[Ultramagnetic MCs]], whose debut ''[[Critical Beatdown]]'' was released in 1988. After two more albums with the group, ''[[Funk Your Head Up]]'' and ''[[The Four Horsemen (album)|The Four Horsemen]]'', Kool Keith released his critically acclaimed solo debut album, ''[[Dr. Octagonecologyst]]'' under the name [[Dr. Octagon]] in 1996. He subsequently released a series of further independently released hip hop albums, including ''[[Sex Style]]'', ''[[First Come, First Served]]'' (as Dr. Dooom), and most recently ''[[Keith (album)|Keith]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/kool-keith-announces-new-album-keith|title=Kool Keith Announces New Album KEITH|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Yoo|first=Noah|date=May 14, 2019|access-date=August 2, 2019}}</ref>

After releasing only one album on a major label, ''[[Black Elvis/Lost in Space]]'', Kool Keith subsequently returned to independently releasing music, producing further efforts as a solo artist and in collaboration with groups such as [[Analog Brothers]], [[Masters of Illusion]], [[Thee Undatakerz]] and [[Project Polaroid]]. Kool Keith has also made guest appearances in collaboration with [[Peeping Tom (band)|Peeping Tom]] and [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]]. He was also featured on the short track DDT on [[Jurassic 5]]'s album ''[[Power in Numbers]]''. [[The Prodigy]]'s hit "[[Smack My Bitch Up]]" was based on a sample of Kool Keith's voice saying "Change my pitch up. Smack my bitch up."

==History==

===Ultramagnetic MCs (1984–1993)===
Kool Keith began his career with the group [[Ultramagnetic MCs]]. After the release of their influential 1988 album ''[[Critical Beatdown]]'', Thornton was reportedly institutionalized in [[Bellevue Hospital Center]].<ref name="RollingStone">{{cite book |editor1=Brackett, Nathan |editor2=Hoard, Christian |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |chapter=Kool Keith |chapter-url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolkeith/biography |edition=fourth |year=2004 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/466 466–467] |url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/466 }}</ref><ref name="Cooper">{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Sean |title=All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-hop |year=2003 |isbn=0-87930-759-5 |publisher=Backbeat Books |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879307592/page/267 267–268] |chapter=Kool Keith |chapter-url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p200714|pure_url=yes}} |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879307592/page/267 }}</ref> However, he later said that the idea that he was institutionalized came from a flippant remark made during an interview, and he never expected the story to become so well known.<ref name="AVClub">{{cite news|last=Downs |first=David|title=Kool Keith and KutMasta Kurt|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|date=November 21, 2008|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/kool-keith-and-kutmasta-kurt-14335|access-date=2008-11-21}}</ref>

After continuing with Ultramagnetic for two more albums (1992's ''[[Funk Your Head Up]]'' and 1993's [[The Four Horsemen (album)|''The Four Horsemen'']]), Thornton would embark on a solo career.

===Dr. Octagon debuts (1995–1996)===
Thornton released his first notable solo single, "Earth People", in 1995, under the name [[Dr. Octagon]]. This was followed by the release of ''[[Dr. Octagonecologyst]]'' the following year. The album's production by [[Dan the Automator]] and [[Kutmasta Kurt]], with [[scratching]] by [[DJ Qbert]] was acclaimed by critics, and the album was released nationally by [[DreamWorks Records]] in 1997, after an initial release on the smaller Bulk Recordings label (as, simply, ''Dr. Octagon'') a year prior. DreamWorks also issued an instrumental version of the album, titled ''[[Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats)]]''.<ref name="RollingStone"/><ref name="Cooper"/>

===Further releases (1997–1999)===
Thornton followed the ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' album with ''[[Sex Style]]'' in 1997, under the name Kool Keith.

In 1996, Thornton collaborated with [[Tim Dog]] for the single "The Industry is Wack", performing under the name Ultra<ref name="RollingStone"/><ref name="Cooper"/>—the album [[Big Time (Ultra album)|''Big Time'']] soon followed. In 1999, he released the album ''[[First Come, First Served]]'' under the name "Dr. Dooom", in which the album's main character killed off Dr. Octagon on the album's opening track. The same year, on August 10, 1999, Thornton released ''[[Black Elvis/Lost in Space]]''. It peaked at #10 on the [[Heatseekers Albums|''Billboard'' Heatseekers chart]], #74 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart, and #180 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]],<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r425836|pure_url=yes}} |title=Charts and awards ''Black Elvis/Lost in Space'' |access-date=2008-09-08 |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> and stands as Thornton's most commercially successful project to date.
