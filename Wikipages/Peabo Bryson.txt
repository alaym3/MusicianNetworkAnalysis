He is known for singing soul [[ballad]]s (often as a duet with female singers) including the 1983 hit "[[Tonight, I Celebrate My Love]]" with [[Roberta Flack]].

==Early years and career==
Born Robert Peapo Bryson in [[Greenville, South Carolina]],<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/peabo-bryson-mn0000035338/biography|title=Peabo Bryson Biography|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=February 1, 2021}}</ref> Peabo Bryson spent much of his childhood on his grandfather's farm in [[Mauldin, South Carolina]]. His love for music stemmed from his mother, who often took the family to concerts of well-known African-American artists at the time.

Bryson marked his professional debut at age 14, singing backup for Al Freeman and the Upsetters, a local Greenville group. It was Freeman's difficulty in pronouncing Bryson's French West-Indian name, Peapo, that led Bryson to perform as Peabo. Two years later, he left home to tour the [[Chitlin' Circuit]] with another local band, Moses Dillard and the Tex-Town Display.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=196}}</ref> Bryson's first break came during a recording session at Atlanta's Bang Records. Although Bang was not impressed with Dillard's band, the young backup singer caught the ear of the label's general manager, Eddie Biscoe. Biscoe signed Bryson to a contract as a writer, producer, and arranger and encouraged Bryson to perform his own songs. For several years, Bryson worked with hometown bands and wrote and produced for Bang.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} In 1976, he launched his own recording career with "Underground Music" on the Bang label. His first album, ''Peabo'', followed shortly thereafter. Although only a regional success, Bryson signed to Capitol Records in 1977.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608001221/Peabo-Bryson.html |title=Peabo Bryson Biography |publisher=Musicianguide.com |access-date=May 5, 2012}}</ref>

Bryson's greatest solo hits include 1977's "Feel the Fire" and "Reaching for the Sky", 1978's "I'm So into You" and "Crosswinds", 1982's "Let the Feeling Flow", 1984's "[[If Ever You're in My Arms Again]]" (his first Top 10 [[Billboard Hot 100|pop]] single, at No. 10 in the US), 1989's "Show and Tell", and the 1991 hit "[[Can You Stop the Rain]]".<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1985, he appeared on the soap opera ''[[One Life to Live]]'' to sing a lyrical version of its theme song.<ref name="Bryson SOD 34-22">{{cite journal |title=Ask Us |journal=[[Soap Opera Digest]] |pages=105â€“106 |date=June 2, 2009 |volume=34 |issue=22}}</ref> Bryson's vocals were added to the regular theme song in 1986 and his voice was heard daily until 1992. He recorded the successful album of [[romantic love]] duets with [[Roberta Flack]] (''[[Born to Love (Peabo Bryson and Roberta Flack album)|Born to Love]]'') in 1983.<ref name="Larkin"/> In partnership with [[Regina Belle]], Bryson recorded two hit duets: "[[Without You (Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle song)|Without You]]", the love theme from the [[comedy film]] ''[[Leonard Part 6]]'', recorded in 1987 and "[[A Whole New World]]", the main theme of the [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]]'s animated [[feature film]] [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|''Aladdin'']], recorded in 1992.
