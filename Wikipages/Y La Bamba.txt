==History==
Y La Bamba's Mendoza was born in San Francisco, California and was influenced by the traditional music of her [[Michoacan, Mexico]] born parents: father in Aguililla, Michoacán and mother in Coalcolman, Michoacán. This includes [[ranchera]]s, [[corrido]]s, [[bolero]]s and [[huapango]]s songs. "Corridos, especially, was very well present in a lot of the bands that played in [[quinceañera]]s, weddings and parties," Mendoza told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. "Those grupero, Tex-Mex, and [[Norteño (music)|norteño]] five-piece acoustic bands with harp and violin, have all shaped my music."<ref name="Billboard">{{cite news |last1=Bustios |first1=Pamela |title=Meet Y La Bamba's Luz Elena Mendoza, Billboard Latin Artist on the Rise |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8542082/y-la-bamba-luz-elena-mendonza-latin-artist-on-the-rise |access-date=December 5, 2019 |work=Billboard |date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>

==Music career==
As a young adult, Mendoza studied theology in New Zealand, then later, did a mission to India. Returning to Oregon—first Ashland, then Portland—she began writing the music that launched her solo career at open mic nights around town. She met bassist and vocalist Ben Meyercord at one of these shows, and Y La Bamba was formed. They recruited the rest of the band, a revolving group of musicians that has included, amongst others,<ref name="Inlander">{{cite news |last1=Brown |first1=Jon |title=The Music of Life and Death |url=https://www.inlander.com/spokane/the-music-of-life-and-death/Content?oid=2133594 |access-date=December 5, 2019 |work=Inlander |date=December 1, 2010}}</ref> Grace Bugbee on bass and vocals, John Niekrasz on drums, Ed Rodriguez and Ryan Oxford on electric guitar,<ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite news |last1=Sherburne |first1=Philip |title=Y La Bamba Mujeres |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/y-la-bamba-mujeres/ |access-date=December 5, 2019 |work=Pitchfork |date=February 21, 2019}}</ref> and Margaret Wehr-Gibson on keys and vocals.<ref name="Oregon Music News">{{cite news |title=Real World Collective presents Peter Gabriel's "Secret World Live" Revolution Hall, Thursday, March 15th |url=https://www.oregonmusicnews.com/real-world-collective-peter-gabriel-preview |access-date=January 17, 2020 |work=Oregon Music News |date=March 11, 2018}}</ref>

===Early albums===
Y La Bamba's debut album, ''Alida St.'' was released in 2008.
