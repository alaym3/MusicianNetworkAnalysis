According to the [[Quran]], '''Zaqqoum''' or '''Zaqqum''' ({{lang-ar|زقوم}}) is a tree that "springs out of the bottom of Hell".  It is mentioned in verses  17:60 (as the "cursed tree"),<ref name="17:60">{{cite quran|17|60|s=ns}}</ref>  37:62-68,<ref name="37:62">{{cite quran|37|62-68|s=ns}}</ref>  44:43,<ref name="44:43">{{cite quran|44|43|s=ns}}</ref> and 56:52,<ref name="56:52">{{cite quran|56|52|s=ns}}</ref> of the Quran.<ref name="ZILQ">{{cite web|last1=Farooqi|first1=M.I.H.|title=Zaqqum in light of the Quran|url=http://www.irfi.org/articles4/articles_5001_6000/zaqqum_in_the_light_of_quran.html|website=Islamic Research Foundation International, Inc.|access-date=30 December 2014}}</ref>

==Religious references==
The Qur'an says:

:[44.43] Surely the tree of Zaqqum, 
:[44.44] Is the food of the [[Islamic views on sin|sin]]ful
:[44.45] Like dregs of oil; it shall boil in (their) bellies,
:[44.46] Like the boiling of hot water.<ref>{{cite quran|44|43|s=ns}}  Translation of M. H. Shakir.</ref>

The fruits of ''Zaqqum'' are shaped like heads of devils (Qur'an 37:62-68). Some [[Islamic scholar]]s believe in a literal meaning of this tree grown in fire, showing the inverted flora of [[Jahannam|hell]]. The inhabitants of hell are forced to eat the tree's fruits, which tears their bodies apart and releases bodily fluids as a punishment. According to [[Umar Sulayman Al-Ashqar]], a leading [[salafism|Salafi]] scholar and professor at the [[University of Jordan]], once the palate of the sinners is satiated, the fruit in their bellies churns like burning oil. Other scholars suggest the tree is grown by the seeds of the evil deeds of the sinners, therefore the devilish fruits are the fruits of their bad actions during lifetime; as [[Ibn Arabi]] stated, the tree stands for the arrogant [[Nafs|self]].<ref>Sarah R. bin Tyeer ''The Qur’an and the Aesthetics of Premodern Arabic Prose'' Springer 2016 {{ISBN|978-1-137-59875-2}} page 82</ref><ref>Muhittin Akgul ''The Qu'ran in 99 Questions'' Tughra Books 2008 {{ISBN|978-1-597-84640-0}}</ref>
