'''Camel''' are an English [[progressive rock]] band formed in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]], in 1971. Led by guitarist [[Andrew Latimer]], they have released fourteen studio albums and fourteen singles, plus numerous live albums and DVDs. Without achieving mass popularity, the band gained a cult following in the 1970s with albums such as ''[[Mirage (Camel album)|Mirage]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Snow Goose (album)|The Snow Goose]]'' (1975). They moved into a jazzier, more commercial direction in the early 1980s, but then went on an extended hiatus. Since 1991 the band has been independent, releasing albums on their own label.

Despite no new studio releases since 2002, the band performed on tour as recently as 2018. Their music has influenced artists including [[Marillion]], [[Opeth]] and [[Steven Wilson]].<ref name="blake">{{cite web | url= https://www.loudersound.com/features/steve-rothery-people-still-think-marillion-are-a-scottish-heavy-metal-band | title= Steve Rothery: "People still think Marillion are a Scottish heavy metal band" | work=Louder | first=Mark | last=Blake | date=22 March 2017 | access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url= https://www.guitarworld.com/news/mikael-akerfeldt-opeth-discusses-camels-moon-madness-record-changed-my-life | title= Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth Discusses Camel's 'Moon Madness'—The Record That Changed My Life | work=Guitar World | first=Mikael | last=Akerfeldt | date=28 July 2014 | access-date=31 October 2018}}</ref><ref name="brinn">{{cite web | url= https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/culture/camel-is-no-rock-dinosaur-555915 | title= Camel is no rock dinosaur | work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] | first=David | last=Brinn | date=9 May 2018 | access-date=13 August 2020}}</ref> Music journalist [[Mark Blake (writer)|Mark Blake]] described Camel as "the great unsung heroes of 70s prog rock".<ref name="blake"/>

==History==
===1970s===
[[File:Camel 23091976 02 300.png|thumb|upright|Andrew Latimer, 1977]]
[[Andrew Latimer]] (guitar), [[Andy Ward (musician)|Andy Ward]] (drums), and Doug Ferguson (bass) had been playing as a trio called the Brew around the [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] area of England. In early 1971 they auditioned to be the back-up band for singer/songwriter [[Phillip Goodhand-Tait]] and appeared on his album ''I Think I'll Write a Song'' on [[DJM Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pg-t.com/1970sdiary.html |title=Phillip Goodhand-Tait singer/songwriter |publisher=Pg-t.com |date=25 March 1979 |access-date=27 October 2011}}</ref> They then recruited keyboardist [[Peter Bardens]] and after an initial gig to fulfill a Bardens commitment under the name Peter Bardens' On, they changed their name to Camel. Their first gig under that name was at [[Waltham Forest College|Waltham Forest Technical College, London]] supporting [[Wishbone Ash]] in December 1971.

In August 1972 Camel signed with [[MCA Records]] and their eponymous debut album ''[[Camel (album)|Camel]]'' was released in early 1973. The record was not a success and the band moved to the [[Deram Records]] division of [[Decca Records]] (UK).<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=p3821/biography |pure_url=yes}} |title=AllMusic Biography |publisher=AllMusic.com |access-date=30 October 2011}}</ref> In 1974 they released their second album, the critically acclaimed ''[[Mirage (Camel album)|Mirage]]'', on which Latimer showed he was also adept on flute. Although failing to chart at home, it gained success in the United States, prompting a three-month tour there.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Released in 1975, the instrumental [[concept album]] ''[[The Snow Goose (album)|The Snow Goose]]'', inspired by the [[Paul Gallico]] [[The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk|short story of the same name]], was the breakthrough album that brought Camel wider attention and success. However, the album attracted a lawsuit from Gallico.<ref name="wrongcopy2">{{cite web|url=http://www.magenta.co.il/camel/albums/tsg.htm|title=The Snow Goose|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> It is often reported that Gallico brought the suit because he "loathed smoking" and thought the band were related to [[Camel (cigarette)|the cigarette brand]].<ref name="rockdet">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/uk/london/camel|title=CAMEL|access-date=1 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519023613/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/uk/london/camel#|archive-date=19 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In reality Gallico described himself as "an addict of the vice in all its blackest forms"<ref name="charlsmail">{{cite journal|journal=Charleston Daily Mail|title=It's Cheaper To Chop Up Pound Notes|page=6|date=17 July 1947|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/charleston-daily-mail/1947-07-17/page-6#13753330789545&iipUpdate=39896689%7C%7C6|access-date=1 August 2013}}</ref> and his objection was simply on the grounds of copyright infringement.<ref name="rockdet" /> Camel accordingly added the prefix ''Music inspired by...'' to the album's front cover and removed the story notes from the back cover.<ref name="wrongcopy2" /> The album's success led to a prestigious appearance at [[Royal Albert Hall]] with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] in October 1975.

The band's fourth album, ''[[Moonmadness (album)|Moonmadness]]'' (1976), was the last to feature the original lineup. [[Mel Collins]] was added to the band on saxophone and flute for the subsequent tour. Drummer Ward was pushing for a move into jazz, which caused bassist Ferguson to quit the band in early 1977.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magenta.co.il/camel/faq/faq-body.htm#4a |title=Frequently Asked Questions |last=Zwebner |first=Ofir |author2=Lasse Ødegård |work=Skylines – Camel Web Site}}</ref> Ferguson formed the band Headwaiter and later became a [[property developer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magenta.co.il/camel/members/members-body.htm#ferguson |title=Camel's members careers |last=Zwebner |first=Ofir |work=Skylines – Camel Web Site}}</ref>

[[Richard Sinclair]] (formerly of [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]]) replaced Ferguson, and Mel Collins joined the band in an official capacity. This lineup released ''[[Rain Dances]]'' (1977) and ''[[Breathless (Camel album)|Breathless]]'' (1978). The latter was the last album to feature Bardens, who announced his departure before the supporting tour.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Peter Bardens {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/peter-bardens-mn0000840845/biography|access-date=2021-08-02|website=AllMusic|language=en}}</ref> He was replaced by two keyboard players both recruited from Caravan: [[Dave Sinclair]] (cousin of Richard) and [[Jan Schelhaas]]. The Sinclair cousins both left the band after the tour, replaced by keyboardist [[Kit Watkins]] and bassist [[Colin Bass]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> This lineup recorded the more commercial ''[[I Can See Your House from Here]]'' (1979); the album's cover caused controversy with its image of a crucified astronaut looking at Earth.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

===1980s===
The 1981 release ''[[Nude (Camel album)|Nude]]'' was a concept album based on a true story of Japanese soldier [[Hiroo Onoda]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Nude - Camel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/nude-mw0000374812|language=en|access-date=2021-08-02}}</ref> [[Duncan Mackay (musician)|Duncan Mackay]] provided most of the keyboards in lieu of Watkins and Schelhaas, who were involved in other projects but returned for the tour.

Without a band, but with a contract to fulfill and pressure from Decca for a hit song, Latimer was joined by an array of guest and session musicians at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in early 1982. The album ''[[The Single Factor]]'' was released later that year, reaching no. 57 in the UK.<ref>{{Citation|title=The Single Factor - Camel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-single-factor-mw0000836654|language=en|access-date=2021-08-02}}</ref> Another lineup featuring keyboardist [[Ton Scherpenzeel]] (of Dutch prog-rock band [[Kayak (band)|Kayak]]) and drummer [[Paul Burgess (musician)|Paul Burgess]] (ex-[[10cc]]) released the album ''[[Stationary Traveller]]'' in 1984.<ref>{{Citation|title=Stationary Traveller - Camel {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stationary-traveller-mw0000698833|language=en|access-date=2021-08-02}}</ref> Camel's contract with Decca expired in late 1984, while Latimer prevailed in a legal dispute with a former manager. Latimer moved to the United States and disbanded the group again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magenta.co.il/camel/faq/faq-body.htm |title=Magenta Camel faq |publisher=Magenta.co.il |access-date=27 October 2011}}</ref>

===1990s===
After a seven-year hiatus, Latimer revived the Camel name in 1991 and released the album, ''[[Dust and Dreams (album)|Dust and Dreams]]'' under his own independent label Camel Productions. The album featured several players who had appeared on the group's two previous albums in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Andrew+Latimer |title=last FM bio |publisher=Last.fm |date=11 February 2009 |access-date=27 October 2011}}</ref> Keyboardist [[Mickey Simmonds]], who had previously backed [[Mike Oldfield]] and [[Fish (singer)|Fish]], joined in 1992.<ref>{{Cite web|title=MICKEY SIMMONDS band / artist (UK-England) - discography, reviews and details|url=https://www.proggnosis.com/Artist/7379|access-date=2021-08-02|website=www.proggnosis.com}}</ref>  

In 1992, a man named Roy Clay approached former Camel drummer Andy Ward and claimed to be a fan of the band as well as an experienced music manager. Clay proposed a Camel reunion tour; Ward supported the scheme but Peter Bardens was the only other former member to show interest.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Obscure Canterbury Groups|url=http://www.calyx-canterbury.fr/bands/obscure.html|access-date=2021-08-02|website=www.calyx-canterbury.fr}}</ref> Clay then enlisted some former members of [[Caravan (band)|Caravan]] and attempted to promote the band as a legitimate new lineup of Camel, but a copyright challenge from Latimer forced a name change. Under the name Mirage, this group conducted a short tour in late 1994 and released a live album.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Review|url=http://www.expose.org/index.php/articles/display/mirage-live-14.12.94-4.html|access-date=2021-08-02|website=Exposé Online}}</ref> The members of Mirage were never compensated, and Clay's fraudulent practices were addressed in a 1995 song by Caravan.<ref>{{Cite web|last=admin|date=2010-07-15|title=Pye Hastings|url=http://www.prog-sphere.com/interviews/pye-hastings/|access-date=2021-08-02|website=Prog Sphere|language=en-US}}</ref> Also under Clay's management, Bardens led another band under the name Mirage that released a live album in 1996. Clay also sold counterfeit Camel merchandise,<ref>{{Cite web|date=May 16, 1998|title=WHAT'S RATTLIN' ? - The Weekly Digest for Canterbury Music Addicts|url=http://www.calyx-canterbury.fr/index/WR/WR%2393.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and several years later was convicted of fraud and forgery.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Roy Clay - Music Produceer's £170,000 Swindle{{!}}Grimsby Telegraph - 2011-04-18|url=https://slides.com/jameskaan/roy-clay-music-producer-jailed|access-date=2021-08-02|website=Slides|language=en}}</ref> 

In the meantime, Latimer and Hoover wrote ''[[Harbour of Tears]]'' (a nickname for [[Cobh]] Harbour in Ireland from which many sailed to the United States during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]) under the Camel name, which was released in 1996. In 1999 Latimer, drummer Dave Stewart, bassist Colin Bass, and keyboardist Ton Scherpenzeel recorded ''[[Rajaz]]'', a record inspired by an ancient Arabic [[Rajaz (prosody)|poetic metre of the same name]] that reflects the rhythm of camel footsteps in the desert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camelproductions.com/CamelTimeline1982_2K_v2.html |title=Camel timeline 1982–2000 |publisher=Camelproductions.com |access-date=27 October 2011}}</ref>

===2000s-2010s===
[[File:Camel In Concert.jpg|thumb|Camel performing in 2003]]
In 2001, Latimer assembled another new lineup with Bass, drummer Denis Clement, and keyboardist [[Guy LeBlanc]]. The band released the album ''[[A Nod and a Wink]]'' in 2002. The album was dedicated to former member Peter Bardens, who had died early that year,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Camel - A Nod and a Wink (album review 2) {{!}} Sputnikmusic|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/50266/Camel-A-Nod-and-a-Wink/|access-date=2021-08-02|website=www.sputnikmusic.com}}</ref> The group was inactive for much of the following decade as Latimer received treatment for [[myelofibrosis]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=April 2015|first=Mike Barnes17|date=2015-04-17|title=Camel: Never Let Go|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/camel-never-let-go|access-date=2021-08-02|website=loudersound|language=en}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Camel have been described as a "symphonic prog rock band".<ref name="smith">{{cite web | url= https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-canterbury-scene-the-sound-of-the-underground | title= The Canterbury Scene: The Sound Of The Underground | work=Louder | first=Sid | last=Smith | date=17 April 2015 | access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref> Predominantly instrumental, Camel's music combines elements from [[rock music|rock]], [[pop music|pop]], [[jazz]], [[blues]], [[folk music|folk]], [[classical music|classical]] and [[electronica]].
