Ellis was a late addition to [[2016 IIHF World Championship rosters#Canada|Team Canada]] at the [[2016 IIHF World Championship|2016 world championships]], joining the team in mid-tournament after Nashville was knocked out of the NHL playoffs; the team went on to win the gold medal.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sadler|first1=Emily|title=Predators' Ryan Ellis joining Team Canada at worlds|url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/predators-ryan-ellis-joining-team-canada-worlds/|access-date=July 3, 2016|publisher=Sportsnet|date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>

==Playing style==
Ellis is an offensive defenceman. A fast skater and skilled stickhandler, he is capable of manoeuvring the puck up the ice from the defensive zone. Known as a [[power play (sport)|power play]] specialist, he often "quarterbacks" from the blueline—controlling puck distribution between teammates in the offensive zone—and possesses a hard and accurate shot.<ref name=special/> He is also a physical player, though he is undersized as a defenceman at 5 feet and 10&nbsp;inches (1.78 metres). He is able to compensate for his lack of overpowering strength with good defensive positioning and active stick-checking.<ref name=bigheart>{{cite news|title=Small Ellis' big heart|url=http://www.torontosun.com/sports/hockey/2010/05/20/14026131.html|access-date=2010-05-20|newspaper=[[The Toronto Sun]]}}</ref>
