==History==

===1980s===
The musical group Sade was formed in London in 1982, by members of the [[Latin soul]] band Pride. [[Sade (singer)|Sade Adu]], [[Stuart Matthewman]], and [[Paul Denman]], together with Paul Anthony Cooke, formed the break-away group and began to write their material. They named the band after lead singer Sade Adu, and made their debut performance in December 1982 at [[Ronnie Scott's Club]] in London in support of Pride. In May 1983, the band performed their first US show at [[Danceteria]] Club in New York City. Andrew Hale joined the band in 1983; Cooke left in 1984. 

Sade received more attention from the media and record companies than Pride had, and eventually separated from that group altogether. On 18 October 1983, the band signed with [[Portrait Records]] (which was absorbed by its parent label, [[Epic Records]], in 1986). When singer Sade and her band of the same name were establishing themselves, their record company, Epic, printed "Pronounced Shar-day" on the record labels of their releases<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Bogdanov |editor1-first=Vladimir |display-editors=etal |title=All Music Guide to Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul |date=2002 |publisher=Backbeat Books |location=San Francisco |isbn=087930653X |page=971 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-pH4i3jXvAC&q=sade+%22shar-day%22+epic&pg=PA971 |access-date=23 August 2016}}</ref> (which led to ''mis''pronunciation in [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] North America).

In February 1984, Sade released their first single, "[[Your Love Is King]]", which became a Top Ten hit. A second single, "[[When Am I Going to Make a Living]]" barely made the Top 40, but the band's debut album, ''[[Diamond Life]]'', was released in July 1984 and peaked at No.&nbsp;2.<ref name="BritChart"/> It spent over six months in the UK Top Ten and was later certified 4x platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry|BPI]]. ''Diamond Life'' won the 1985 [[Brit Award]] for [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1985|Best British Album]],<ref name="Brits">[http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/sade Brit Awards: Sade] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125210406/http://www.brits.co.uk/artist/sade |date=25 November 2014}} Brits.co.uk.

The band embarked on their first major UK tour, augmented by [[Dave Early]] (drums), Martin Ditcham (percussion), Terry Bailey (trumpet) and Gordon Matthewman (trombone). A third single, "[[Smooth Operator]]", was released from the album with a video directed by [[Julien Temple]]. The single became their first US hit in spring 1985, propelling the album in the US Top Ten. Also in 1985, the band were nominated for two [[MTV Video Music Awards]]—"[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]]" and "[[MTV Video Music Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]]". 

On 13 July 1985, Sade performed at the [[Live Aid]] at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]] in London. Sade Adu became the only African-born artist to appear in front of the live audience of 75,000 and an estimated worldwide television audience of 1.4 billion in 170 countries.

In late 1985, Sade released their second album, ''[[Promise (Sade album)|Promise]]'', which peaked at No. 1 in both the UK and the US.<ref name="BritChart">Roberts, David (2006).
