==Life and music career==
Although a native of [[Anambra State]], Chibuzor Nelson Azubuike was born and raised in [[Enugu State]]. His stage name, given to him by one of his high school friend, was derived from the word phenomenal. Phyno developed an interest for music production during his secondary school days. He initially wanted to become a pilot, but was told he could be a [[Doctor of Medicine|doctor]]. Throughout secondary school, he learned to play the drums and piano. He also learned to create his own rendition of every recording he heard. He studied public administration at the Institute of Management and Technology in Enugu, and started profiting from music during his second year there. Phyno told Ifeoma Onoye that [[Mr Raw]] is one of the few people he looks up to.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://dailyindependentnig.com/2013/08/i-have-a-mad-style-but-i-am-not-crazy-phyno/ | title=I have a mad style but I am not crazy –Phyno | publisher=Daily Independent | access-date=3 September 2014 | author=Ononye, Ifeoma | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907080305/http://dailyindependentnig.com/2013/08/i-have-a-mad-style-but-i-am-not-crazy-phyno/ | archive-date=7 September 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://thenationonlineng.net/new/phynom-i-mr-raw-made-me/ | title=PHYNO:M.I, Mr Raw made me | publisher=The Nation | date=7 July 2013 | access-date=3 September 2014 | author=Akande, Victor | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907083842/http://thenationonlineng.net/new/phynom-i-mr-raw-made-me/ | archive-date=7 September 2014 | url-status=live }}</ref> Phyno started rapping in 2010 and relocated to [[Lagos]] to further his music career.<ref name="The Punch 1"/>
