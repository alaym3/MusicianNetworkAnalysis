Their music has been described as "evoking [...] childhood nights fraught with existential dread" <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://do512.com/p/strange-inquiry-with-elvis-depressedly|title=Strange Inquiry with Elvis Depressedly}}</ref> and has been likened to the earlier music of [[Ariel Pink]] and [[Elliott Smith]].

==History==

=== Formation, Early EPs, and Run for Cover ===
Elvis Depressedly was formed in 2011 in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], originally as a way for Cothran to explore his Bowie-esque alter ego of "Mickey", referenced in the early EPs as a way for him to confront and examine his fears and anxieties.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thefourohfive.com/music/article/behind-the-scenes-with-elvis-depressedly-i-always-used-music-to-cope-and-i-probably-always-will-143|title=Behind the Scenes with Elvis Depressedly: "I always used music to cope, and I probably always will."|last=http://thefourohfive.com|work=The 405|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}</ref>

The band debuted with the self-release of the five-track EP ''Save the Planet Kill Yourself.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Elvis-Depressedly-Save-The-Planet-Kill-Yourself/release/5621711|title=Elvis Depressedly - Save The Planet Kill Yourself|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref> It was followed by the EP ''Goner'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://elvisdepressedly.bandcamp.com/album/goner|title=goner, by elvis depressedly|website=elvis depressedly|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref> and the single "Disgraceland" in the same year. In 2012 Cothran played his first show under the name Elvis Depressedly, playing the entirety of the album ''Mickey's Dead'', which was released later that year on [[Orchid Tapes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mat Cothran talks new Elvis Depressedly album, future of Coma Cinema|url=http://www.shufflemag.com/mat-cothran-talks-new-elvis-depressedly-album-future-of-coma-cinema/|publisher=Shuffle Magazine|accessdate=8 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207012541/http://www.shufflemag.com/mat-cothran-talks-new-elvis-depressedly-album-future-of-coma-cinema/|archive-date=7 February 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Elvis-Depressedly-Mickeys-Dead/release/5914156|title=Elvis Depressedly - Mickey's Dead|website=Discogs|access-date=2016-06-06}}</ref>
