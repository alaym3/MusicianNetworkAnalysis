[[File:Metronomy.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Metronomy founder and frontman, Joseph Mount]]
As a teenager, [[Joseph Mount]] began Metronomy as a bedroom project while he was still living with his parents in [[Devon]]. After having an interest in music from an early age, he "drummed in a few bands at school and they all fell apart. Then I got an old computer off my dad and I started messing around when I was about sixteen or seventeen".<ref name="LQmay08">{{cite web|url=http://www.loudandquiet.com/2010/01/metronomy/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=9 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814215201/http://www.loudandquiet.com/2010/01/metronomy/ |archive-date=14 August 2016 }} Stuart Stubbs, 'Interview: Metronomy', ''Loud and Quiet Magazine'', May 2008 (vol. 2).</ref> The name Metronomy was originally chosen by Mount and was said to be influenced by the band names of [[Autechre]] and [[Funkstorung]].<ref name="LQmay08" />

In 2002, Mount moved to [[Brighton]] for his studies,<ref name="Fact12">[http://www.factmag.com/2012/08/28/on-record-metronomys-joe-mount-on-outkasts-ridiculously-inspirational-speakerboxxthe-love-below/ "Factmag"] Angus Finlayson, 'On Record: Metronomy’s Joe Mount hails Outkast’s "ridiculously inspirational" Speakerboxx/The Love', ''Fact Magazine'', 28 August 2012.</ref> while having a number of odd jobs, including one at a local [[HMV]]. Upon graduating, he became interested in music production and began "soundtracking animations".<ref>[http://chicalors.blogspot.co.uk/2014/02/on-phone-joseph-mount-mouth-of-metronomy.html ] Bob Henderson, 'On the Phone: Joseph Mount, the mouth of Metronomy', ''Chic Alors'', 12 February 2014.</ref> During his time in Brighton, Mount began to get involved with electronic music nights and performed as a DJ. At one of these gigs he was approached by "some guy, [who] told me he’d put out a record. It turned out that of the songs I’d recorded, I had an album’s worth".<ref name="ClashBrighton">[http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/metronomy-guide-to-brighton "Clash Brighton"] Tristan Parker, 'Metronomy's Guide To Brighton', Clash Music, 18 November 2009.</ref>

In the autumn of 2005, Metronomy released a debut album, ''[[Pip Paine (Pay the £5000 You Owe)]] ''preceded by the first single 'You Could Easily Have Me'.<ref name="LQmay08" /> After it had received limited attention, Mount began to build up a reputation for live shows. Initially, Metronomy was essentially a laptop/DJ act, although Mount soon asked his cousin Oscar Cash and an old schoolfriend Gabriel Stebbing to join him.<ref name="Argus11">[http://www.theargus.co.uk/leisure/music/8976421.Metronomy__Digital__Brighton__April_19/?ref=arc "Argus interview 2011"] Duncan Hall, 'Metronomy, Digital, Brighton', ''The Argus'', 15 April 2011.</ref> Mount explained that "I was doing some shows on my own (...), which was pretty crap, so I thought it would be better to get a band thing going on".<ref name="LQmay08" />

Over the next three years, the trio spent gaining live-experience while Mount recreated mixes for many other artists, as contractual issues with the record company halted any new release.<ref name="LQmay08" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.egigs.co.uk/?a=12204 |title=Absolutely Free Web Based Magazine |publisher=eGigs |date=19 March 2008 |access-date=25 November 2011}}</ref> On remixing, Mount has said "(b)asically, I only like remixers that really care about what they're doing. I can honestly say that I have got really involved in all of my remixes. If I’ve not got anywhere with one I will tell whoever it is that I’m giving up.

Although the band was now a three-piece live, in the studio Mount was "still writing and recording it all on my own" and "influenced by people who’ve written, recorded and produced things all on their own, like Prince".<ref name="LQmay08" /> In 2008, the band released the singles "My Heart Rate Rapid", "Holiday", "Heartbreaker" (which feat. a Remix by Kris Menace), "A Thing For Me" and "Radio Ladio" and the full album ''[[Nights Out]]'' in September of that year. Kris Menace's Remix of "Heartbreaker" became Hype Chart Nr.1 in 2008. In May 2009, it was announced through the band's Myspace page that Stebbing would be leaving the band. Joseph wrote "It's all very amicable and he's assured me he doesn't think he's fleeing a sinking ship." Stebbing is currently{{when|date=February 2020}} working with his own band, Your Twenties, which is being produced by Mount.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} Despite this, Stebbing reappeared to play bass for Metronomy for their appearance at the Far Out stage at Green Man 2010.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 2011, the band released three singles 'The Look', 'Everything Goes My Way' and 'The Bay' from their 3rd album ''[[The English Riviera (album)|The English Riviera]]'' which came out on 11 April.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15337-the-english-riviera/ |title=Metronomy: The English Riviera &#124; Album Reviews |publisher=Pitchfork |date=19 April 2011 |access-date=10 March 2014}}</ref>

On 23 January 2014, Metronomy's upcoming single ''Love Letters'' was named [[Zane Lowe|Zane Lowe's]] "Hottest Record in the World". In a telephone interview with the band, it was confirmed that the video would be directed by [[Michel Gondry]]. Their fourth studio album, ''Love Letters'', was released on 10 March 2014, with the band achieving their highest ever position on the UK Albums Chart, at number 7.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

In an interview with ''[[Crack Magazine]]'', it was revealed that Metronomy would be releasing a new album in the summer of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crackmagazine.net/article/music/metronomy-rose-tinted-rave/ |title=Metronomy: Rose-tinted Rave |publisher=Crack Magazine, Crack Industries Ltd |date= 3 May 2016}}</ref> The title of the album was later revealed to be ''[[Summer 08]]'', with its release scheduled on 1 July 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079m9cs |title=Metronomy |publisher=[[BBC Radio 1]].

===Pre-Metronomy===
Before Mount started writing music as Metronomy he, Gabriel and friend Kevin Hawes, who died in 2005, performed and wrote music as part of The Upsides and The Customers.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

'''The Upsides''' were a band that Joseph and Gabriel joined when still in their early teens. According to Joseph they "played proper original pop songs - we like to think we were the original [[Busted (band)|Busted]]". The band came to an end when both guys moved to Brighton to start university.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

'''The Customers''' started out in 1996 as a studio project for Will and Gregg who lived in a neighbouring village to Joseph's and Gabriel's home in [[Devon, England|Devon]], but did not enter its present form until all members had moved from Devon to Sussex.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Will worked with Gabriel and played out live under the guise of Willis. The name changed to The Customers on Christmas Day 2001. Joseph joined the band as drummer in 2002 and they welcomed Gregg back into the line-up to complete the four piece.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

==Live performances==
[[File:20150627 Düsseldorf Open Source Festival Metronomy 0008.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Metronomy live at the Open Source Festival 2015, Düsseldorf]]
Metronomy have toured widely throughout the UK and Europe supporting acts such as [[Coldplay]], [[Bloc Party]], [[CSS (band)|CSS]], [[Klaxons]], [[Kate Nash]] and [[Justice (French band)|Justice]]. They engaged in their first headline UK tour in 2008. Metronomy have also played gigs in America and Canada notably at the 2007 [[SXSW]].<ref>[http://www.musictowers.com/news/features/interview-metronomy-go-all-zooroper-on-claire-kember/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713215212/http://www.musictowers.com/news/features/interview-metronomy-go-all-zooroper-on-claire-kember/ |date=13 July 2007 }}</ref>

Up until April 2009 Joseph Mount's performance of keyboards, vocals, and guitar in the live band was accompanied by members Oscar Cash (keyboards, [[melodica]] and [[saxophone]]), and Gabriel Stebbing (keyboards and [[bass guitar]]). Since Stebbing's departure from Metronomy in 2009 their live set has been known as Metronomy 2.0 and has been highly praised by Stebbing.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Metronomy's new band features{{when|date=February 2020}} former [[Lightspeed Champion]] drummer Anna Prior and bassist Olugbenga Adelekan.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Metronomy's live shows include dance routines and light shows. Most notably they use push lights stuck to their chests. Mount explained: "We did our first gig in Brighton, and a few days before I saw these lights in a pound shop and I thought ‘we’ll whack these on our t-shirts and do some synchronised light shows!’ I’m totally aware that some people hate it but equally I think some people enjoy it just for the fact that it’s a bit of fun."<ref name="LQmay08" />

Metronomy performed at [[Field Day (Sydney festival)|Field Day]] music festival in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]] on [[New Year's Day]] 2012<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fuzzy.com.au/coming-up/252/info |title=Coming Up: Field Day 2012 |publisher=Fuzzy |date=29 September 2011 |access-date=27 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001111/http://fuzzy.com.au/coming-up/252/info |archive-date=26 April 2012 }}</ref> and toured the UK in February 2012 with [[Two Door Cinema Club]], [[Tribes (band)|Tribes]] and [[Azealia Banks]] on the [[NME Awards Tour]] 2012. They also performed at [[Primavera Sound]] Festival in Barcelona in May 2014, at [[Rock Werchter]] in Belgium in June 2014 and at Festival No.6 at Portmeirion, Wales in September 2015.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}
