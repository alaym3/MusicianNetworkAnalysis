'''Emilia Pardo Bazán y de la Rúa-Figueroa''' (16 September 1851{{snd}}12 May 1921), countess of Pardo Bazán, was a Spanish novelist, journalist, literary critic, poet, playwright, translator, editor and professor. She is known for introducing [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] into Spanish literature, for her detailed descriptions of reality, and for her ground-breaking  introduction of feminist ideas into the literature of her era. Her ideas about women's rights for education also made her a prominent feminist figure.

==Life==
=== Childhood and education ===
Emilia Pardo Bazán<ref>Her full name was Emilia Antonia Socorro Josefa Amalia Vicenta Eufemia Pardo Bazán y de la Rúa Figueroa, II Pontifical Countess of Pardo-Bazán and I Countess of the Tower of Cela. See José-Domingo Vales Vía, [http://anuariobrigantino.betanzos.net/Ab2005PDF/2005%20265-276%20JDomingo%20Condesa.pdf «Doña Emilia Pardo-Bazán y su efímero título nobiliario.»] ''Anuario Brigantino'', 2005, n.º 28, págs. 265-276. ISSN 1130-7625</ref> was born into an affluent noble family in [[A Coruña]],  [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain. The family's principal residence was in Rúa Tabernas but they also owned two other houses, one close to [[Sanxenxo]] and the other, known as the [[Pazo de Meirás]], located in the outskirts of the city.
Her father, believing in the intellectual equality of men and women,<ref name=":1">{{cite book|last=Alberdi|first=Inés|author-link=Inés Alberdi|title=Vida de Emilia Pardo Bazán|year=2013|publisher=EILA Editores|isbn=978-84-940316-8-7}}</ref> provided her with the best education possible, inspiring her life-long love for literature.<ref name="bucolica" /> She wrote her first poems at the age of nine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fernández Cubas|first=Cristina|author-link=Cristina Fernández Cubas|title=Emilia Pardo Bazán|year=2001|publisher=Ediciones Omega|page=15|isbn=84-282-1240-6}}</ref>
Emilia had access to a broad range of reading material in her father's library, later stating that among her favorites were ''[[Don Quijote de la Mancha]],'' the [[Bible]] and the ''[[Iliad]]''. Other early readings included ''La conquista de México'' by [[Antonio de Solís]]<ref>{{cite book |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001445744 |title=History of the Conquest of Mexico by the Spaniards |year=1738 |location=London |author1=Antonio de Solís |author2=Thomas Townsend }}</ref> and ''[[Parallel Lives]]'' by [[Plutarch]]. She was fascinated by books about the [[French revolution]]. Her family would spend their winters in Madrid, where Emilia attended a French school sponsored by the Royal Family,<ref name="bucolica">{{cite book|last=González Megía|first=Marta|title=Prólogo a "Bucólica"|year=2007|publisher=Lengua de Trapo|isbn=978-84-89618-33-6|pages=XI}}</ref> and where she was introduced to the work of [[La Fontaine]] and [[Jean Racine]]. Her frequent visits to France would prove to be especially useful later in her life by helping her connect with the literary world of Europe and become familiar with important authors like [[Victor Hugo]]. When she was twelve her family decided to stop their winter visits to Madrid, staying in A Coruña where she studied with private tutors. She refused to follow the rules that limited women to just learning about music and home economics.  She received formal education on all types of subjects, with an emphasis on the humanities and languages. She became fluent in French, English, and German. She was not permitted to attend college. Women were forbidden to study science and philosophy, but she became familiar with those subjects by reading and talking with friends of her father.<ref name=":1" />

=== Marriage and literary career ===
At the age of sixteen Emilia married Don José Antonio de Quiroga y Pérez de Deza, a country gentleman who was himself only eighteen and still a law student. The following year, 1868, saw the outbreak of the [[Glorious Revolution (Spain)|Glorious Revolution]], resulting in the deposition of Queen Isabella II and awakening in Emilia an interest in politics. She is believed to have taken an active part in the underground campaign against [[Amadeo I of Spain]] and, later, against the [[First Spanish Republic|republic]].

In 1876 she won a literary prize offered by the municipality of [[Oviedo]], for an essay entitled ''Estudio crítico de las obras del padre Feijoo'' (''Critical Essay on the Works of Father Feijoo''), the  subject of her essay being a [[Benedictine]] monk. Emilia Pardo Bazán always had a great admiration for Feijoo, an eighteenth-century Galician intellectual, possibly due to his feminism ''avant la lettre''. She also published her first book of poems in the same year, entitled ''Jaime'' in honor of her newborn son. This was followed by a series of articles in ''La Ciencia cristiana'', a highly orthodox Roman Catholic magazine, edited by Juan Orti y Lara.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911}}

Her first novel, ''Pascual López: autobiografía de un estudiante de medicina'' (''Pascual López: Autobiography of a Medical Student''), which appeared in 1879, was written in a realist, romantic style. She was encouraged by its success and, two years later, she published ''Un viaje de novios (A Honeymoon Trip''), in which an incipient interest in French naturalism can be observed, causing something of a sensation at the time. This was further fuelled by the appearance of ''La tribuna'' (1883), which was more heavily influenced by the ideas of [[Émile Zola]] and is widely considered to be the first Spanish naturalist novel. Her response to the critics' outrage was published in 1884 under the title ''La cuestión palpitante'' (''The Critical Issue'').{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911}} Her husband did not feel strong enough to weather the ensuing social scandal created by a woman daring to express her views about such matters and two years later the couple began an amicable separation, Emilia living with their children while her husband took up residence in the [[Castle of Santa Cruz]] in A Coruña, which he had acquired at an auction. It was only after their separation that her relationship with the writer [[Benito Pérez Galdós|Galdós]] blossomed into a full-blown intimate affair, which was to prove enduring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cvc.cervantes.es/literatura/aih/pdf/04/aih_04_1_022.pdf|title=Aspectos inéditos de Emilia Pardo Bazán (Epistolario con Galdós)|author=Carmen Bravo-Villasante}}</ref>

1885 saw the publication of ''El Cisne de Vilamorta'' (''The Swan of Vilamorta''), in 
which the naturalist scenes are more numerous and more pronounced than in any of her previous works, although the author has been accused of shrinking from the logical application of her theories by inserting a romantic and inappropriate ending. Probably the best of Emilia Pardo Bazán's work is embodied in ''Los pazos de Ulloa'' (''[[The House of Ulloa]]''), published in 1886,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Review of ''The Son of the Bondswoman'' by Emilia Pardo Bazán, translated by Ethel Harriet Hearn; translation of ''Los Pazos de Ulloa'', but with the omission of "Apuntes Autobiográficos" (92 pages in the original Spanish)|journal=The Athenaeum|issue=4174|date=October 26, 1907|page=514|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=__I_PcOFSw8C&pg=PA514}}</ref> which recounts the slide into decadence of an aristocratic family, as notable for the heroes Nucha and Julián as for characters including the political bravos, Barbacana and Trampeta. Yet perhaps its most abiding merit lies in its depiction of country life, the poetic realization of Galician scenery portrayed in an elaborate, colourful style. A sequel, with the significant title ''La madre naturaleza'' (''Mother Nature''), published in 1887, marked a further advance in the path of naturalism, and henceforth Pardo Bazán was universally recognized as one of the principal exponents of the new naturalistic movement in Spain, a role confirmed by the publication of ''Insolación'' (''Sunstroke''), and ''Morriña'' (''Homesickness'') in 1889. In this year her reputation as a novelist reached its highest point.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911}}

During her last years of writing, Emilia Pardo Bazán wrote many essays and gave lectures in renowned institutions. She also began to intervene in political journalism as well as fighting for the right of women to social and intellectual emancipation. Thus, around 1890, her work evolved towards greater symbolism and spiritualism.

In 1905 she published a play entitled ''Verdad'' (''Truth''), better known for its boldness than for its dramatic qualities.{{sfn|Fitzmaurice-Kelly|1911}} Her last novel, ''Dulce dueño'' (''Sweet Master'') was published in 1911, but she continued to write short stories like ''El revólver'' (''[[The Revolver]]''), publishing more than 600 over the course of her career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.casamuseoemiliapardobazan.org/emilia-pardo-bazan/obra.html|title=Casa Museo Emilia Pardo Bazán}}</ref>

=== Support for women's rights ===
Pardo Bazán was a standard bearer for women's rights and dedicated both her literary production and her life to their defense. In all of her works she incorporated her ideas on the modernization of Spanish society, on the need for female education and on women's access to all the rights and opportunities that men already enjoyed.

In 1882, she participated in a conference organized by The Free Educational Institution, and openly criticized the education received by the Spanish women, in which values like passivity, obedience and submission to their husbands were relentlessly promoted.

In spite of the patent sexism in the intellectual circles of her era, Emilia Pardo Bazán became the first woman to preside over the literature section of the Ateneo de Madrid in 1906, and the first to occupy a chair of Neo-Latin literature at the Central University Of Madrid (former name of The [[Complutense University of Madrid]]). She inherited the title of Countess on her father's death in 1908 and in 1910 was appointed a member of the Council of Public Instruction. In 1921 she was appointed to the [[Senate of Spain|Senate]] but never formally took up her seat. Much to her frustration, she was repeatedly refused a seat at the [[Royal Spanish Academy|Spanish Royal Academy]], purely on the grounds of her gender.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fernández Cubas|first=Cristina|author-link=Cristina Fernández Cubas|title=Emilia Pardo Bazán|year=2001|publisher=Ediciones Omega|page=51|isbn=84-282-1240-6}}</ref> 
She died in [[Madrid]] in 1921.

=== Racial determinism ===
According to [[Brian J. Dendle]], her naturalism partially drinks from late 19th-century theories of racial heritage and atavism.{{Sfn|Dendle|1970|p=17}} She was well-versed in the racial theories applied to criminology by [[Cesare Lombroso]].{{Sfn|Dendle|1970|pp=18–19}} Featuring a Catholic ideological matrix close to [[Alejandro Pidal y Mon|Pidal y Mon]], she espoused nonetheless [[Racism|racist]] views.{{Sfnm|Dendle|1970|1pp=17–31|Álvarez Chillida|2002|2pp=227–228|Rehrmann|2007|3pp=219–220}} She held antisemitic ideas, to the point of denigrating both Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews.{{Sfn|Rehrmann|2007|pp=219–220}} She tried to justify [[antisemitism]] in 1899 in the context of the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the pages of ''[[La Ilustración Artística]]'': "The Dreyfus affair is nothing but an episode of the secular struggle that covered the Middle Ages in blood in the streets of Valencia and Toledo [...] The crusade against Dreyfus can be explained, and as it can be explained it can be partially justified".<ref>{{Harvnb|Pardo Bazán|1899|p=426|ps=&nbsp;«El asunto Dreyfus [no es] sino episodio de la lid secular que ensangrentó en la Edad Media las calles de Valencia y de Toledo» [...] «La cruzada contra Dreyfus se explica, y al explicarse queda medio justificada»}}; cfr. {{Harvnb|Guereña|2003|p=360}}</ref>

=== Food writer ===
Fond of [[gastronomy]], in 1905 Pardo Bazán prologued ''La cocina práctica'' ("the practical cuisine") by her friend [[Manuel Maria Puga y Parga|Manuel Purga y Parga]], aka ''Picadillo''.<ref name=recetas>{{Cite journal|url=http://revistalatribuna.gal/index.php/TRIBUNA/article/view/50|title=Las recetas de doña Emilia|first=Carlos|last=Fernández Santander|volume=3|year=2005|journal=La Tribuna: Cadernos da Casa-Museo Emilia Pardo Bazán}}</ref> She later wrote her own culinary works, such as ''La cocina española antigua'' (1913).<ref name=recetas /> She is credited as one of the food writers and gastronomes who joined the initiative for pushing forward the idea of the modern Spanish national cuisine in the early 20th-century, recognisable by Spaniards as their own.<ref>{{Cite journal|journal=Culture & History Digital Journal|volume=6|issue=2|year=2017|issn=2253-797X|doi=10.3989/chdj.2017.019|title=The Gestation of Modern Gastronomy in Spain (1900-1936)|first1=Ainhoa|last1=Aguirregoitia-Martínez|first2=Mª Dolores|last2=Fernández-Poyatos|page=019|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321370968|doi-access=free}}</ref>
