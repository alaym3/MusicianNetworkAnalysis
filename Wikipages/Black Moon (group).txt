== Biography ==
=== Early years ===
The roots of Black Moon go back to Brooklyn's [[List of high schools in New York City|Bushwick High School]], where Karim "5ft" Reid and Ewart "DJ Evil Dee" Dewgrade met and formed a group called Unique Image. The two later met a former backup dancer Kenyatte "[[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]]" Blake in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of Brooklyn, and formed a friendship based on similar musical aspirations.<ref name="5ft">{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Todd E.|date=June 2004|title=Half Moon Behind Bars|url=http://www.mvremix.com/urban/interviews/blackmoon.shtml|access-date=June 20, 2006|work=MVRemix}}</ref>

The trio released their first single "[[Who Got da Props|Who Got the Props?]]" in 1992,<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Black Moon biography from Duck Down|url=http://www.duckdown.com/website/blackmoon.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920034552/http://www.duckdown.com/website/blackmoon.html|archive-date=September 20, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Harling|first=Danielle|date=October 16, 2013|title=Black Moon's Buckshot, DJ Evil Dee & 5 FT Detail "Who Got Da Props?"

The group recruited Evil Dee's older brother Walter "Mr. Walt" Dewgrade for recording the pre-production of their debut studio album, which eventually led to the formation of [[hip hop production]] team [[Da Beatminerz]] between Dewgrade brothers. Black Moon premiered its debut studio album, ''[[Enta da Stage]]'', on October 19, 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Allah|first=Sha Be|date=October 19, 2017|title=The Source {{!}}Today In Hip Hop History: Black Moon Drops Their Debut Album 'Enta Da Stage' 24 Years Ago|url=https://thesource.com/2017/10/19/today-hip-hop-history-black-moon-drops-debut-album-enta-da-stage-24-years-ago/|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=[[The Source]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Scott|first=Dana|date=October 19, 2018|title=Duck Down Records Founders Buckshot & Dru Ha Reflect On "Enta Da Stage" 25 Years Later|url=https://hiphopdx.com/interviews/id.3160/title.duck-down-records-founders-buckshot-dru-ha-reflect-on-enta-da-stage-25-years-later|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=[[HipHopDX]]}}</ref> including "Who Got da Props?", "Son Get Wrec", "How Many MC's...", "Buck 'Em Down" and another Hot 100 hit single "I Got Cha Opin (Remix)". The album featured guest appearances from [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]] of [[Mobb Deep]], Nervious Records' intern and promoter [[Drew "Dru-Ha" Friedman]], and debuting hip hop duo [[Smif-N-Wessun]]. ''Enta da Stage'' went on to sell over 350,000 copies in the U.S. and is now regarded as an underground hip hop classic. Following the album's release, the group temporarily broke up.<ref name="Larkin90" />

=== Departure from Nervous Records ===
Member Buckshot and Dru Ha formed [[Duck Down Music|Duck Down Management]] in 1994 to formally manage Black Moon and Smif-N-Wessun.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindstrom|first=Al|title=Feature: The Indie Series Presents: Dru Ha|url=http://allindstrom.com/2010/11/feature-the-indie-series-presents-dru-ha/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110701143402/http://allindstrom.com/2010/11/feature-the-indie-series-presents-dru-ha/|archive-date=July 1, 2011|publisher=AlLindstrom.com}}</ref> The year 1995 saw the release of Smif-N-Wessun's debut album ''[[Dah Shinin']]'' through Nervous Records' sub-label Wreck Records, which featured contributions from Evil Dee with his extended production team Da Beatminerz and Buckshot, who recruited fellow Brooklyn local groups [[Heltah Skeltah]] and [[O.G.C. (band)|Originoo Gunn Clappaz]] to form a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called the [[Boot Camp Clik]].<ref name="Larkin90" />

Due to the group's hiatus, Black Moon refused to submit a new album for Nervous Records and were dropped from the label. However, in late 1996 Nervous Records released a Black Moon compilation album titled ''[[Diggin' in dah Vaults]]'', which featured a number of remixes and b-side tracks. The album was not authorized by the group as the label bootlegged it and became entangled in a legal battle over the licensing rights of their group name, which lasted for a number of years. The case was finally settled in 1998, and the group was able to license its name through Nervous.<ref name="Larkin90" />

In 1999, the group released its long-awaited second album ''[[War Zone (album)|War Zone]]'' through [[Priority Records]]. The album saw a change in the group's musical style, with a more mature and more serious lyrical delivery from member Buckshot, more vocal contributions from member 5&nbsp;ft (who appeared on three songs from ''Enta da Stage'' and six songs on ''War Zone''), and also featured a new lo-fi production sound from the original two members of Da Beatminerz.<ref name=":0" /> Alongside several Boot Camp Click members, it features guest appearances from rappers [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Heather B. Gardner|Heather B.]], [[M.O.P.]], [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] and Teflon. Despite its singles "Two Turntables & a Mic" and "This Is What It Sounds Like (Worldwind)" made small impact on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]], the album reached number 35 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart and remains the group's highest charted full-length.

Later the same year, Buckshot released his debut solo studio album, ''[[The BDI Thug]]'', to mediocre reviews and poor sales.

=== 2000s ===
Four Black Moon songs was included in 2000 compilation ''[[Basic Training: Boot Camp Clik's Greatest Hits]]''. Black Moon, together with Lord Have Mercy, were featured on the track "Devastatin' .... That's Us!" from Da Beatminerz debut album ''[[Brace 4 Impak]]'', released in 2001.

Black Moon returned in 2003 for the release of its third album ''[[Total Eclipse (Black Moon album)|Total Eclipse]]'', which is the first Black Moon album featured production from outside record producers other than Da Beatminerz (such as [[Nottz]] and [[MoSS]]). It produced the underground hit "Stay Real" and "Pressure is Tight", as well as two music videos, shot for the singles "Stay Real" and "This Goes Out to You". The album, like the group's previous efforts, received good reviews, but it wasn't able to reach outside the underground hip hop audience.

DJ Evil Dee continued production work with Da Beatminerz, and Buckshot continued to work with the Boot Camp Clik. In 2004 the group released a [[documentary film]] ''Behind the Moon''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 18, 2015|title=Black Moon's 'Powaful Impak' Is The Focus Of A Duck Down Feature Documentary (Video)|url=https://ambrosiaforheads.com/2015/09/black-moons-powaful-impak-is-the-focus-of-duck-downs-new-feature-documentary-video/|access-date=October 18, 2020|website=Ambrosia For Heads|language=en-US}}</ref> In 2005, Buckshot released a collaborative album with producer [[9th Wonder]] titled ''[[Chemistry (Buckshot and 9th Wonder album)|Chemistry]]''. In 2006, DJ Evil Dee and Mr. Walt released a mixtape titled ''Alter the Chemistry'', which paired Buckshot's vocals from the ''Chemistry'' album with classic Black Moon beats.<ref name=":0" /> Member 5&nbsp;ft provided his first appearance on Boot Camp Clik album ''[[Casualties of War (album)|Casualties of War]]'' with the song "BK All Day". From 2008 to 2009, Buckshot has released his second collaborative album with [[9th Wonder]] titled ''[[The Formula (album)|The Formula]]'', followed by a studio album with [[KRS-One]] titled ''[[Survival Skills (album)|Survival Skills]]'', both to appear on the ''Billboard'' 200.

=== 2010s ===
It was recently confirmed by the group in 2011 that it started recording its fourth album together called ''Dark Side of the Moon'' and to be entirely produced again by Da Beatminerz, with possible new members to its production team.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Markman|first=Rob|date=September 9, 2011|title=Black Moon to Reunite for Beatminerz-Produced LP|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1670503/black-moon-beatminerz-produced-lp/|access-date=September 20, 2019|website=MTV}}</ref> However, the event did not happen until 2019, when the group scheduled to reunite for their first album in 16 years.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paine|first=Jake|date=September 20, 2019|title=Black Moon Is Rising Once More.
