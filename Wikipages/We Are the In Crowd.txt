==History==
[[File:WATIC Bamboozle Signing.jpg|thumb|WATIC at Bamboozle 2011]]

In April 2009, We Are the In Crowd's [[Myspace]] page was hacked. The hacker was an ex-member of the band and deleted all of their friends and music. The music site [[Absolutepunk.net]] posted a news article regarding the hacking,<ref>{{cite web|author=Rohan Kohli |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=985731 |title=The In Crowd Hacked – News Article |website=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=2015-03-28}}</ref> and the news post attracted the attention of someone at [[Hopeless Records]] who contacted the band shortly after. Jardine made a video on [[YouTube]]  announcing the hack.

On November 10, 2009, the group announced their signing with [[Hopeless Records]] as "The In Crowd" and released their first single "For the Win" on [[iTunes]]. The band changed their name to "We Are the In Crowd" due to trademark issues with a reggae band from the seventies who were also called "[[The In Crowd (reggae band)|The In Crowd]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wearetheincrowd.com/post/349598237/name-change |title=We Are the In Crowd, WE ARE The in Crowd |website=Wearetheincrowd.com |date=2009-10-06 |access-date=2015-03-28}}</ref>

In February 2010, We Are the In Crowd recorded their debut Hopeless Records EP with producers Zack Odom and Kenneth Mount ([[All Time Low]], [[Mayday Parade]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Cartel (band)|Cartel]]). The EP, titled ''[[Guaranteed To Disagree]]'', was released on June 8, 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hopelessrecords.com/we-are-the-in-crowd-release-new-song/ |title=We Are the In Crowd Release New Song! |website=Hopelessrecords.com |access-date=2015-03-28}}</ref>

We Are the In Crowd entered the studio in early May 2011 to begin recording their full-length debut.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://commonrevolt.com/post/4971282200|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430122702/http://commonrevolt.com/post/4971282200|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 30, 2011|title=Common Revolt Interview with: We Are The In Crowd &#124; Common Revolt|date=April 30, 2011|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref> On August 3, 2011 it was announced the album would be titled ''[[Best Intentions (album)|Best Intentions]]'', with a release date of October 4.

The band regularly tours all year long with fellow bands such as [[All Time Low]] and [[Mayday Parade]], and have appeared at [[Vans Warped Tour|Warped Tour]] in 2010 and 2012, and  festivals such as Leeds. In 2013, the band toured around much of the world, including the UK.

The band has announced via a Fuse video interview that they will be recording material for a new album to be released in the summer/fall of 2013. On August 20, 2013, they released their new single "Attention".

They also announced a UK tour in late January followed by a US tour. The second single from the album, "The Best Thing (That Never Happened)", was released on Spotify that same day, and due to the "overwhelming response" they released it on iTunes the same day, a few days early.

In August 2014 the band were announced as the support acts for British rock band [[Don Broco]] during their [[Kerrang!]] tour in February 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.kerrang.com/22011/first-two-bands-kerrang-tour-2015-revealed/|title = First two bands on Kerrang! tour 2015 revealed|date = August 27, 2014|access-date = August 27, 2014|website = Kerrang.com|last = Carter|first = Emily}}</ref>
