It debuted in the UK at number two, behind [[Eminem]]'s ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP 2]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/eminem-scores-seventh-consecutive-uk-number-1-album__3327/|title=Eminem scores seventh consecutive UK Number 1 album|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|date=10 November 2013|access-date=3 December 2019}}</ref> and became the 30th best-selling album of 2013 in the country.

In November 2013, Arthur generated much controversy over the use of homophobic lyrics in a song. [[Mickey Worthless]], a Croydon battle rapper, had issued "Stay In Your Lane" a track mocking Arthur, because Worthless didn't feel it was right that Arthur was presenting himself as a battle rapper on national radio. Arthur responded to Worthless with his vitriolic diss track "Hey Mickey" issuing string of slurs directed at Worthless, rapping "Hilarious, precarious you Talibani confused, imbellic mimic of a gimmick" adding the slur "You fucking queer".<ref name=nme>{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/james-arthur/73906#WWPR8wbfETQEEG7c.99|title=Rapper who started beef with 'X Factor"s James Arthur says 'I feel no remorse at all'|author=Adam Bychawski|publisher=NME|date=18 November 2013|access-date=23 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tonks|first1=Owen|title=James Arthur and Lucy Spraggan 'queer' row: Disgusted fans demand album refund after bitter text exchange|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/james-arthur-lucy-spraggan-queer-2815957|access-date=16 April 2016|work=mirror}}</ref> This sparked outrage among the [[LGBT]] community and led to Twitter spats with comedians [[Frankie Boyle]] and [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]], and singer [[Lucy Spraggan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/james-arthur-and-lucy-spraggan-in-homophobic-twitter-spat-8955135.html|title=Independent.

Further controversies arose after the reviews to his projected rap mixtape ''All the World's a Stage'', particularly regarding the track "Follow the Leader" where he rapped "I'm gonna blow up your family like I'm a terrorist". This led to further accusations of Arthur glorifying violence. This infuriated Simon Cowell who said "I think James, unfortunately, has had so many issues with what he has done publicly{{snd}}which is a real issue with me... Somebody should have told him to shut up and just put the records out". On 5 April 2014, several media outlets began to report that Arthur had been dropped from Syco, following the dispute over "Follow the Leader".<ref>{{cite web|last=Drewett|first=Meg|title=James Arthur 'dropped by record label Syco after mixtape controversy'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a562694/james-arthur-dropped-by-record-label-syco-after-mixtape-controversy.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|access-date=6 April 2014|date=6 April 2014}}</ref> He took to Twitter to deny the claims;<ref>{{cite news|last=Rigby|first=Sam|title=James Arthur denies being dropped by Syco, criticises 'media circus'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a562723/james-arthur-denies-being-dropped-by-syco-criticises-media-circus.html|access-date=6 April 2014|date=6 April 2014}}</ref> however, on 11 June 2014, Arthur announced via Twitter that he and Syco had parted ways by mutual agreement.
