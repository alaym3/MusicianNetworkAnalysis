==Music career==
===Madrugada===
Høyem rose to fame in the late 1990s when [[Madrugada (band)|Madrugada]] made their Norwegian breakthrough with debut album [[Industrial Silence]]. The band members included Sivert Høyem (vocals), [[Frode Jacobsen]] (bass), and [[Robert Burås]] (guitar). After the death of Burås on 12 July 2007, Høyem and Jacobsen decided to finish recording their latest album. The album, entitled ''[[Madrugada (Madrugada album)|Madrugada]]'', was released on 21 January 2008. After the release of the album the band announced they would split after one last tour. They performed their last ever concert on 15 November 2008 at [[Oslo Spektrum]].

===Solo===
He has the last few years had success as a solo artist, releasing the albums ''Ladies and Gentlemen of the Opposition'' (2004), ''Moon Landing'' (2009) and ''Long Slow Distance'' (2011), ''Endless Love'' (2014) and ''Lioness'' (2016).

He formed his band the Volunteers made up of:
*Sivert Høyem: Vocals/Guitar/Songwriter
*Cato Salsa: Guitars/Keyboards
*Børge Fjordheim: Drums/Shaker/Tambourine
*Rudi Nikolaisen: Bass (Live)
*Kalle Gustafson Jerneholm: Bass (On Record)
*Christer Knutsen: Guitars/Keyboards

He released the album ''Exiles'' in 2006 credited to Sivert Høyem & the Volunteers. He toured with his band in May 2007 playing at festivals across Norway. In December 2009 he concluded another tour with his new band. In April 2012 in a radio interview at the "Rock Show" radio program in Greece, he clearly stated that there won't be any other album with the Volunteers.

In September 2010 Sivert Høyem launched the song "Prisoner of the road" in order to raise awareness for [[Norwegian Refugee Council|NRC]], which is this year's recipient of the Norwegian National Telethon.
