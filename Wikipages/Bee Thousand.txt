'''''Bee Thousand''''' is the seventh album by American [[indie rock]] band [[Guided by Voices]], released on June 21, 1994, on [[Scat Records]]. After its release the band became one of the more prominent groups associated with the "[[lo-fi music|lo-fi]]" genre, a movement defined by the relatively low [[fidelity]] of audio releases. Musically, the album draws inspiration from [[British Invasion]]-era [[rock music]] and [[punk rock]]. Following the release of ''Bee Thousand'', the band began to attract interest from other record labels, eventually signing with [[Matador Records|Matador]] for their next album.

==Background==
Guided by Voices is a Dayton, Ohio-based band formed in 1983. Although by 1992 the band had released five full-length albums (not including their 1986 debut EP, ''[[Forever Since Breakfast]]''), Guided by Voices was not a band in a conventional sense; its line-up was extremely loose, consisting of whoever of a group of friends showed up to short notice recording sessions. [[Robert Pollard]] thought of Guided by Voices as more of a "songwriter's guild" than a band, and also said that "Whoever could come over would play. [...] It was just a bunch of friends who could occasionally get together so it didn't really feel like a band."<ref name="p. 23–25">Woodworth (2006). p. 23–25</ref>

''Bee Thousand'' was to be the original band's final album. Pollard was close to disbanding Guided by Voices by 1993, due to financial constraints and pressure to focus more on his family and teaching career;<ref>Woodworth (2006). p. 13</ref> Pollard has also stated that the band was nearly broken up as early as 1991, during the creation of ''[[Propeller (Guided by Voices album)|Propeller]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gbv.com/unpeeledinterview2004.html |title=Unpeeled Interview with Robert Pollard 2004 |work=Unpeeled |last=Miller |first=Nick |access-date=July 13, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070806124847/http://www.gbv.com/unpeeledinterview2004.html |archive-date=August 6, 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Pollard was also struggling with writing for a follow-up record to ''[[Vampire on Titus]]'' and ''Propeller'', which had been the band's two most noticed records yet. However, it occurred to him to "deconstruct" and "reconstruct" the band's older, unused material into new songs.<ref name="p. 23–25" />

==Recording==
Unlike some of the band's earlier releases, Bee Thousand was not recorded in a [[Recording studio|studio]], but rather on [[Multitrack recording|four track machines]] or other primitive home recording devices in the garages and basements of various band members. Moreover, many of the [[Demo (music)|demo]] takes of the songs were the ones that were used for the album. Due in part to both of these factors, several unusual errors are present in the album's recording and mixing; for example, the guitar track drops out at one point in "Hardcore UFO's".<ref name="p. 28">Woodworth, 2006. p. 28</ref> The band's choice to use inexpensive recording devices was initially a matter of economics, but eventually the band grew to prefer the sound. Pollard said that:

{{quote|...For our first [EP], ''Forever Since Breakfast'', we went into a studio and created a very mediocre recording out of a very sterile environment. I thought, "''Fuck that''. If we're paying for it and no one's listening to these records anyway, if we're only making them for ourselves, then I'm going to put exactly what I want on them."<ref>Woodworth (2006). p. 17–18</ref>}}

[[Kevin Fennell]] similarly said, "When ''Bee Thousand'' came out we sounded much less professional than we did in 1982. The music was much more spontaneous."<ref>Woodworth (2006). p. 73</ref> Pollard also said that, at the time, the band's recording style was intended to sound like [[The Beatles bootlegs|Beatles bootlegs]].<ref name="p. 28" /> Furthermore, songs were usually completed in a minimum number of takes with no [[rehearsal]] beforehand.<ref name="p. 21">Woodworth, 2006. p. 21</ref> In all, recording for the album was extremely brief, taking only three days,<ref>Woodworth (2006). p. 77</ref> with Pollard estimating that each song took roughly half an hour.<ref name="p. 21" />

==Music==
The music of ''Bee Thousand'' is influenced by [[British Invasion]] rock music, as well as what Pollard calls the "four P's" of rock: [[Pop music|pop]], [[punk rock]], [[progressive rock]], and [[psychedelia]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/09/10/guided-by-his-own-voice/663e85b9-a5b4-47cb-bbd8-c1a3fa1b8a66/ |title=Guided by His Own Voice |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=September 10, 2004 |access-date=June 15, 2020 |last=Harrington |first=Richard}}</ref> Only a few new songs were written for the album, among them "[[I Am a Scientist]]" and "Gold Star for Robot Boy", with the rest of the album mostly being [[overdubbed]], rerecorded, or edited versions of the band's older, unused material.

While typical rock instruments, such as [[guitar]], [[bass guitar|bass]], and [[Drum kit|drums]], are dominant, a variety of instruments and sounds are used. [[Recorder (musical instrument)|Recorder]]s are used in "The Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory", and a [[piano]] is used in the closing track "You're Not an Airplane".<ref name="airplane">{{cite web |url=http://www.gbvdb.com/track.asp?trackid=14080 |title=You're Not An Airplane |publisher=GBVDB |access-date=July 19, 2007}}</ref>

===Lyrics===
Pollard's surreal lyrical style has been compared to the [[cut-up technique]] of [[Beat generation|Beat]] writer [[William S. Burroughs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.popmatters.com/ellis040915-2496099279.html |title=G.B.V -- R.I.P: For the Love of Rock |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=September 15, 2004 |access-date=July 18, 2007 |last=Ellis |first=Iain}}</ref> Many of the album's lyrics reflect childish or fantastical themes and were heavily influenced by the statements and actions of Pollard's [[fourth grade]] class, exemplified by "Gold Star for Robot Boy". Pollard was inspired to write "The Goldheart Mountaintop Queen Directory" after having an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]]-triggered [[psychedelic experience]] in which he perceived his own face in a mirror changing into his son's face; however, the song's lyrics are not about this event.<ref name="p. 28"/> According to Pollard, "I Am a Scientist" is "the first song that showed some maturity in my ability as a songwriter."<ref>Woodworth (2006). p. 16</ref>  The lyrics for "Tractor Rape Chain" are taken from three other songs: "Still Worth Nothing", "Tractor Rape Chain (Clean It Up)", and "Tell Me".

==Title and cover art==
The title ''Bee Thousand'' was inspired by a group brainstorming session, during which band members smoked [[cannabis]]. Pollard's brother, Jim, thought of "zoo thousand", allegedly inspired by a [[Milestone|mile marker]] reading "Z1000." This phrase coalesced with a misspelling of a movie title at a [[drive-in theater]], with "[[Beethoven (film)|Beethoven]]" spelled as "Beethouen", which Pollard liked because the misspelling sounded like the name of [[The Who]] guitarist [[Pete Townshend]]. Other considered titles included ''All That Glue'' and ''Instructions for the Rusty Time Machine'', both of which were used in the lyrics of other Guided by Voices songs.<ref name="recycled">{{cite web |url=http://www.gbvdb.com/recycled.asp |title=Recycled!: Re-used Lyrics, Titles, Music & Images |publisher=GBVDB |access-date=July 17, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614165814/http://gbvdb.com/recycled.asp |archive-date=June 14, 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>
