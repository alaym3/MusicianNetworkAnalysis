During his childhood he enjoyed playing basketball and played on a basketball team either from a club or school. In school he met many of his friends including a girl named Leah. Scorey had met Leah in grade 7, they had the same class and they immediately clicked and started dating . They both played basketball and would wait for practice together. Near the summer before 10th grade in 9th grade Leah was going out of town with her family and the car they were riding in crashed, she was the only one to pass away in the crash. Scorey's mom had gotten a call from the school with the bad news and after school she told him the news, he was only 14 at the time of Leah's passing. In school they offered counseling services after her death. Scorey said he regrets not going to the counselor for help. Scorey recalls memories of Leah, such as getting suspended for skipping school to go to the store with her and her throwing his Foamposites around after his basketball practice, he said that her throwing his shoes was the last time he remembers taking to her. Leah was his best friend and he says that she was the type of person to always remind him to organize his binder, not sleep in class. He said she was like a mom in a way. Scorey has mentioned Leah multiple times in songs and even has a song dedicated to her called Leah's Song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Smallz |first1=DJ. |title=Scorey Quit Xanax, Percocet After Fentanyl Overdose From Fake Pressed Pill, Polo G Reaction (part 6) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJhXA_W4Fu4 |website=Youtube |publisher=DJ Smallz |access-date=31 October 2021}}</ref>
