'''Jungle''' is a British [[electronic music]] project founded in 2013 by [[musical production|producers]] Josh Lloyd-Watson and Tom McFarland.

Jungle have released three studio albums. 2014's ''[[Jungle (Jungle album)|Jungle]]'' was shortlisted for the [[Mercury Prize]] that year.  Their second album was 2018's ''[[For Ever (Jungle album)|For Ever]]'' through [[XL Recordings]], while their third album, ''[[Loving in Stereo]]'', was released on 13 August 2021 via Caiola Records. The group is based in London.

==Background==
Jungle was founded by Josh Lloyd-Watson and Tom McFarland.<ref name="han">{{cite web|url=http://hereandnow.wbur.org/2014/06/23/jungle-music-collective |title= Jungle: A British Music Collective With Disco Beats|publisher=Here & Now |date=23 June 2014 |access-date=9 July 2014}}</ref> The pair had been friends since they were nine years old, where they lived next door to each other in [[Shepherds Bush, London|Shepherds Bush]], London.<ref name="esquire">{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/music/6606/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jungle/ |title=Everything You Need To Know About Britain's Hottest Band |publisher=Esquire |date=2 July 2014 |access-date=9 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151227180601/http://www.esquire.co.uk/culture/music/6606/everything-you-need-to-know-about-jungle/ |archive-date=27 December 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 
They both attended [[Latymer Upper School]], a fee-charging private school in Hammersmith.
They went on to form Jungle at the beginning of 2013, choosing to put an aesthetic emphasis on the music's surrounding artwork and videos, and not on the pairs' own identity (Lloyd-Watson and McFarland came to be known as J and T).<ref name="passionoftheweiss">{{cite web|url=http://www.passionweiss.com/2014/03/12/question-in-the-form-of-an-answer-an-interview-with-jungle|title=Interview With Jungle |publisher=Passion of the Weiss |date=12 March 2014 |access-date=12 March 2014}}</ref> Throughout the following year Jungle developed its nature as a collective by working with different artists across diverse disciplines. To perform the music live, Jungle expanded to a seven-piece band, fronted by J and T. The pair wished to challenge themselves, resisting the temptation to simply re-produce their music from their laptops, and instead translated their songs into a full and organic live experience. J and T have explained that Jungle stemmed from a desire for ‘honesty… true connection and friendship. It's about being in a collective and collective energy… [a] team spirit.’<ref name="“pigeonsandplanes">{{cite web|url=http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2014/06/interview-jungle-on-friendship-self-censorship-and-the-mystery-that-they-never-intended/

'''Band Opinions'''

Call Jungle a Band, Call Them a Music Collective — Just Don’t Call Them Famous article by [https://wwd.com/wwd-masthead/maxine-wally/ Maxine Wally] from WWD.<ref name="Wally">{{Cite web|last=Wally|first=Maxine|date=2018-12-19|title=Call Jungle a Band, Call Them a Music Collective — Just Don’t Call Them Famous|url=https://wwd.com/eye/people/jungle-band-for-ever-heavy-california-cherry-smile-stephen-colbert-1202935086/|access-date=2021-10-18|website=WWD|language=en-US}}</ref> "Americans appear to be slightly less self-conscious," McFarland explains. “They’re much more willing to let loose and not really worry about whether they look like an idiot — whereas English people definitely go, ‘I can’t possibly let loose, it’s a Monday night.’”<ref name="Wally"/>

=== Music videos ===
Jungle is known for their one-shot dance videos directed by Josh Lloyd-Watson, one-half of Jungle, who often works with the same dancers, choreographer, and cinematographer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/best-music-videos-2019.html|title=The Best Music Videos of 2019|last=Zadie|first=Mooj|date=12 December 2019|website=Vulture.com|language=en-us|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref>

Music videos for Casio, Heavy California, Cherry and the directors cut for Happy Man, were choreographed by Nat Zangi and Kane Klendjian (KZ Creatives) who also stars in the Happy Man. All four music videos were directed by Josh Lloyd-Watson and Charlie Di Placido, with Oliver Hadlee Pearch co-directing on Happy Man. The director of photography for all four videos was Olly Wiggins.

The dancers in Casio are Will West, Che Jones, Nathaniel Williams, Jordan Melchor, Ziggy Taylor and Mette Linturi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dancentricity.com/2019/02/jungle-casio-heavy-california-cherry-happy-man-music-videos.html|title=Jungle – Casio + Heavy, California + Cherry + Happy Man directors cut (Music Videos)|website=Dancentricity.com|access-date=23 June 2020}}</ref>
