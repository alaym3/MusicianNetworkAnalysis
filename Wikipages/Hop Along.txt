==History==
Hop Along began as an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] [[freak folk]] [[solo project]] known as ''Hop Along, Queen Ansleis'' in 2004, during Frances Quinlan's senior year in high school.<ref name="Vulture"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPWNmTsJL1E|title=Hop Along // Interview|last=Backstage Broadcast|date=May 31, 2013|access-date=April 6, 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> Quinlan released their debut album ''Freshman Year'' in the summer of 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/31430/Hop-Along-Queen-Ansleis-Freshman-Year/ |title=Hop Along Queen Ansleis - Freshman Year (album review ) |publisher=Sputnikmusic |access-date=2013-05-21}}</ref>

Quinlan performed an acoustic solo act for several years as they honed their style. "I would envy [full ensembles] because I thought that a band inherently carries more energy than a person does solo. I suppose you could argue that point, but when I was playing by myself it was just out of necessity. I wanted to play and I just couldn’t seem to get a band together. I wanted to write and I didn’t want to wait for anybody."<ref name="McQueen">{{Cite journal |last=McQueen |first=Greg |date=December 9, 2015 |title=An Interview with Hop Along: With Eyes Painted Shut |journal=[[The Aquarian Weekly]] |publisher=Arts Weekly Inc. |url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2015/12/09/an-interview-with-hop-along-with-eyes-painted-shut/ |access-date=February 20, 2016 }}</ref>

Three years after Quinlan's first album, their brother Mark joined the project as drummer, followed by bassist Tyler Long in 2009. After their new formation, the band's name was shortened to Hop Along.<ref name="Vulture">{{cite web |last1=Fox |first1=Jesse David |title=Is This the Best Voice in Rock Music Today? |url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/05/this-the-best-voice-in-rock-music-today.html |website=Vulture |access-date=4 August 2021 |date=8 May 2015}}</ref> The band went on to release an EP, ''Wretches'', in 2009.
