They have also been known to experiment with different metal genres, going from songs that are predominantly thrash metal to a switch to a [[black metal]] sonority mid-song. The band's later albums have begun to incorporate more [[Screaming (music)|screamed]] and [[death growl|growled]] vocals by keyboard player Elliot Vernon, adding elements of [[metalcore]] and [[death metal]] to the band's sound. Alestorm has also included elements of [[pop music|pop]], [[rap metal]], [[nu metal]], [[progressive metal]], and [[symphonic metal]].{{refn|group=note|Musical styles:{{columns-list|
