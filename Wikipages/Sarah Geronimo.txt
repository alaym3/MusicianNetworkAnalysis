==Music and voice==
Geronimo's music is generally [[Pop music|pop]] and sings songs mostly about love. International producer [[Christian de Walden]] praised Geronimo's voice and said "The personality of her voice is phenomenally distinct. Many have great voices but they tend to imitate foreign divas like [[Celine Dion]], [[Mariah Carey]] or [[Whitney Houston]]. She definitely is the biggest talent I have come across within the last ten years...".<ref>Ojo P. Panaligan (June 23, 2006) [http://www.mb.com.ph/node/84725 Famed international producer affirms Sarah Geronimo is future of OPM]. Mb.com.ph</ref>

Rito P. Asilo of ''Philippine Daily Inquirer'' stated in a review of her album: "it's hard to resist the rich and lush quality of her melodies when they fall smoothly and squarely on her confident middle registers" and has praised her transition saying, "her phrasing style to her interchanging shifts in vocal placement, from deep chest tones to heady soft trills, and back which isn't really a bad thing: In fact, it could represent growth because Sarah used to win her admirers solely with the lung-busting high notes."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/57380/sarah-g-prays-for-change-in-pure |title=Sarah G prays for change in 'Pure' |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=September 7, 2012 |access-date=August 12, 2013}}</ref>

==Influences==
Geronimo has cited [[Michael Jackson]] as her major influence and she grew up singing and dancing to his music.<ref>[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=508828&publicationSubCategoryId=86 An amazing life with Sarah Geronimo – The Philippine Star " Lifestyle Features " Sunday Life]. ''The Philippine Star''. (September 27, 2009). Retrieved 2012-06-05.</ref> Geronimo said: "As a child, my dream was to be hugely popular like [[Michael Jackson]]. I wanted to have that kind of worldwide fame," added, "I want to be like him while performing, everyone gets so wild and emotional. Besides that, I see him as not only a performer, he's an inspiration to many people, and that's what I also want to become." Geronimo also cited American pop star, [[Beyoncé]] as one of her influences in singing and dancing live.<ref>[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/06/19/12/sarah-g-filipino-beyonce Is Sarah G the Filipino Beyonce?] ''ABS-CBN News''.

==Stage==
After Geronimo's concert in Araneta Coliseum dubbed as "The Other Side", ''The Manila Bulletin'' said:{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

"Sarah's very successful concert showcased the various facets of her personality. She's an old soul who can sing [[Celine Dion]]'s "[[Miracle (Celine Dion album)|If I Could]]" and [[Mariah Carey]]'s "[[Through the Rain]]" with such emotion. She's an 80s baby who can moonwalk to "[[Billie Jean]]" ala [[Michael Jackson]]. She's a budding belter who can hit the high notes of [[Whitney Houston]]'s "[[The Greatest Love of All]]" with [[Regine Velasquez]]."

Geronimo's participation in the "What Love Is..." with [[Martin Nievera]] concert was described by Baby A. Gil of the ''Philippine Star'' with the comment, "Who needs a dancing Martin anyway when you have the long-limbed Sarah there, who is a daring, enthusiastic dancer? I like watching her dance and finding her moving even better now than the last time is a treat. Of course, she has also become an even better singer. To those who are wont to ask, has she gotten rid of her [[Celine Dion]] tendencies? Well, she still sings a good [[To Love You More (Sarah Geronimo song)|To Love You More]], but she has obviously come to her own with fuller tones, nice, sexy low notes."<ref name="philstar"/>

In her 24/SG concert ''People's Journal'' commented, "Sarah has reached a new level in her career as a concert artist. In fact, she has earned the right to be called the Concert Queen of the New Generation." Aside from her singing prowess, Geronimo's dancing skills has improved greatly.<ref>[http://journal.com.ph/index.php/entertainment/showbiz-news/34377-sarahs-24sg-her-best-concert]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723033040/http://journal.com.ph/index.php/entertainment/showbiz-news/34377-sarahs-24sg-her-best-concert|date=July 23, 2012}}</ref>

Camille Bersola of ''The Philippine Star'' described Geronimo as more than just a [[pop icon]] for being an inspiration, especially to today's youth. She stated: "In amateur singing competitions, there will be at least three contestants that will have their own rendition of '[[To Love You More (Sarah Geronimo song)|To Love You More]]' or '[[Forever's Not Enough]]'.

Geronimo however admitted it's not always easy protecting that image, especially since everyone looks up to her as a role model for young people. She said, "It's a bit hard although I'd like to become a role model. I rather take it as a big challenge because it is probably my purpose being here in this industry. This may also be the reason why I'm being trusted by companies to promote their products."<ref name="popicon" />
