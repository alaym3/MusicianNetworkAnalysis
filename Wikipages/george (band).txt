'''George''' (stylised as '''george''') were an Australian rock band from [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]]. The band's first album, ''[[Polyserena]]'', reached No. 1 on the Australian charts on 17 March 2002.<ref name="ARIA Charts" />

==Background==
For most of george's career, the band consisted of [[Katie Noonan]] on vocals and keyboards, her brother [[Tyrone Noonan]] on vocals, guitar and keyboards, Geoff Green on drums and percussion, [[Paulie Bromley]] on bass guitar and Nick Stewart on acoustic and electric guitar. Geoff Hooton, a bass guitar player, left the band in early 2000 and was replaced by Bromley.

The Noonans formed the nucleus of the band, doing most of the songwriting and lead vocals. Stewart also contributed to many of the band's tunes. The Noonans grew up with a background in classical music; their mother, Maggie Noonan, is a well-known opera singer. Katie Noonan studied opera and jazz at the [[Queensland Conservatorium Griffith University|Queensland Conservatorium]].

Stewart grew up listening to and playing rock music. Bromley played in the underground Brisbane rock band [[Pangaea]] with [[Ben Ely]] of [[Regurgitator]]. Green studied music at the Queensland University of Technology.

==History==
The band were formed in 1996 to enter a university music competition. They released a series of independent EPs, namely ''[[Self-titled/Homebrew|George]]'' in 1998, ''[[You Can Take What's Mine (George album)|You Can Take What's Mine]]'' in 1999 and ''[[Bastard Son/Holiday]]'' in 2000. ''Bastard Son/Holiday'' peaked at number 74 on the [[ARIA chart]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aria.com.au/issue567.pdf |title=ARIA Report Week Commencing 8th January 2001 |website=pandora.nla.gov.au |access-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20020221-0000/www.aria.com.au/issue567.pdf |archive-date=21 February 2002  }}</ref> The EPs did progressively better, earning good airplay on [[Triple J]] radio and community radio stations across Australia.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} George were also winning a strong live following throughout Australia.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}}

George signed with [[Festival Mushroom Records]] in mid-2001. "[[Special Ones]]" was the first single released on Festival Records, followed by "[[Run (George song)|Run]]" in October 2001 and "[[Breathe in Now]]" in February 2002. From this time the band toured heavily.

The band's first album, ''[[Polyserena]]'', debuted at No. 1 on the national album charts in its first week; George became only the tenth Australian band to do this with a debut album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aria.com.au/Issue628.pdf |title=The ARIA Report - WEEK COMMENCING: 11th March 2002 Issue No: 628 |website=pandora.nla.gov.au |date=11 March 2002 |access-date=25 April 2016 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/23790/20020314-0000/www.aria.com.au/Issue628.pdf |archive-date=14 March 2002  }}</ref> ''Polyserena'' was certified double platinum and spent 36 weeks in the top 50.<ref name="ARIA Charts" />

In January 2003, the band joined the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] over two nights (23 and 25) to perform ''[[Concerto for Group and Orchestra]]'' by [[Jon Lord]]. The band is the only rock group other than [[Deep Purple]] to perform the piece. It was typical of the band's eclectic approach combining classical, rock, funk, jazz and even electronic music.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

George released the album ''[[Unity (George album)|Unity]]'' in February 2004 and it debuted at No. 5 on the Australian album chart of 1 March 2004. Katie Noonan said on the band's website that the title reflected the band's approach on the album. "That family vibe brings a closeness and honesty that permeates what we do. Collectively and individually, we've been through a great period of change and growth. Knowing we can look to each other for strength brings comfort and solidarity. We have all been through the same thing and there's an incredible sense of union from that experience - that's what being in a band's about."<ref>[http://www.george.net.au/ Official website]</ref>

George performed live in [[Brisbane]] on 22 December 2004.<ref>[http://www.george.net.au/index.php?module=concert&func=view&startnum=43&what=allconc Official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070902171645/http://www.george.net.au/index.php?module=concert&func=view&startnum=43&what=allconc |date=2 September 2007 }}</ref> Following this, the band took a break while individual members attended to their own projects. While there were no immediate plans to regroup and perform, or to record new material, the band intended to make a comeback at some stage. The band reformed for a performance on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House on 27 January 2005.

In 2016, the band was announced to perform at Victoria's [[Queenscliff Music Festival]], the band's first performance in 11 years.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.auspop.com.au/2016/07/the-purge-150/ |title=THE PURGE #150 |website=auspOp |date=21 July 2016 |access-date=21 July 2016}}</ref> The band also put on a 20th-anniversary celebration at the Concert Hall, QPAC, during the Brisbane Festival on 9 September 2016.<ref>Nathanael Cooper, [https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/brisbane-band-george-reunite-for-one-night-at-brisbane-festival-20160629-gpufke.html "Brisbane band george reunite for one night at Brisbane Festival"], ''Brisbane Times'', 29 June 2016</ref> Following their performance at [[Taronga Zoo]] in 2017, the group once again folded and returned to their individual careers.

In 2021, the band announced a reunion to play a residency at the Brisbane Powerhouse to play ''Polyserena'' in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web |title=Aussie Indie Darlings george Celebrate The 20th Anniversary Of Seminal Album 'Polyserena' With A Series Of Brisbane Concerts |url=https://scenestr.com.au/music/aussie-indie-darlings-george-celebrate-the-20th-anniversary-of-seminal-album-polyserena-with-a-series-of-brisbane-concerts-20210323 |website=Scenestr |publisher=Eyeball Media |access-date=26 April 2021}}</ref>
