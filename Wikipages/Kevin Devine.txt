'''Kevin Devine''' (born December 19, 1979) is an American songwriter and musician from [[Staten Island]], New York City, who is known for his introspective and political themes. He is a contemporary member of the underground [[indie rock]] and [[indie folk]] musical scenes, and his influences range from older indie artists such as [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Elliott Smith]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] to more mainstream and well known acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Bob Dylan]].<ref name="inTuneMusicOnline">{{cite web |url = http://intunemusiconline.com/2010/01/27/kevin-devine-linfinity-scott-matthew-nyc-12710/ |title = inTuneMusic Online: Kevin Devine/ Linfinity / Scott Matthew @ NYC 1/27/10 |access-date = February 5, 2010 |author = Ambrose, Anthony |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://archive.today/20130126094435/http://intunemusiconline.com/2010/01/27/kevin-devine-linfinity-scott-matthew-nyc-12710/ |archive-date = January 26, 2013 }}</ref> In 2013, Kevin Devine rejoined his previous band, Miracle of 86, for a series of reunion shows.<ref name="Sonic Awareness">{{cite web |url = http://sonicawareness.net/post/53120281096/show-recap-miracle-of-86-hopewell-nyc-6-15-2013 |title = sonicawareness.net: Show Recap: Miracle of 86 / Hopewell @ NYC 6/15/2013 |access-date = June 18, 2013 |author = Ambrose, Anthony}}</ref>

==History==

===Beginnings===
Kevin Devine grew up in [[Brooklyn]] and [[Staten Island]] and has spent significant time in Manhattan and Queens. Devine graduated from [[Fordham University]] at Lincoln Center in 2001, majoring in journalism and writing for the school newspaper, [[Fordham Observer|''The'' ''Fordham Observer'']].<ref>{{Cite web|last=BUCKNAM|first=AMY|date=2012-05-03|title=Kevin Devine Finds Success in Music After Fordham|url=https://fordhamobserver.com/11473/arts-and-culture/kevin-devine-finds-success-in-music-after-fordham/|access-date=2021-06-06|website=The Observer}}</ref> He first played in the band Delusion, which later changed its name to Miracle of 86 (referring to the [[1986 New York Mets season|1986 New York Mets]]). At Fordham he was able to hone his solo, acoustic style by playing at various open-mic and college events. Devine released his first solo album, entitled ''[[Circle Gets the Square]]'', in 2002 under the record label Immigrant Sun Records, as well as being produced by Bill Manoudakis. During this time he also appeared in regular stints at the [[Wetlands Preserve]] venue in New York City.

His brother, Dan Devine, is a columnist for The Ringer.

===Increased success (2002–2007)===
Although still relatively unknown, Devine gained some popularity with his 2003 album, ''[[Make the Clocks Move]]''. This album's songs reflect Devine's political views and a growing introspective style, inspired by recent death of his father to a stroke. These two styles would become a staple in Devine's music that followed.

It is the first of two albums released on [[Triple Crown Records]]. It is also the first of three albums produced by Chris Bracco and Mike Skinner (ex-Miracle of 86). In 2005, Devine released his third full-length album, ''[[Split the Country, Split the Street]]''. He signed with [[Capitol Records]], who released his fourth album, ''[[Put Your Ghost to Rest]]'', on October 17, 2006. Only four months after his major label debut, Devine was dropped from Capitol Records due to EMI merging Virgin and Capitol Records.

Devine was able to gather a strong fan base as a result of his exposure through touring with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] (who were also formerly signed to Triple Crown Records). First appearing as their opening act on their 2004 spring tour, Devine made a small splash among their fan base; however, opening for them again in April 2006 and joining their 2007 Spring tour with [[Manchester Orchestra]] greatly increased his fan base and affected his career. Devine also toured solo with [[Jesse Lacey]] of [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] and singer-songwriter Grace Read.

===''Brother's Blood'' and ''Bad Books'' (2008–2010)===
After negotiations with Capitol Records, ''Put Your Ghost To Rest'' was re-released on April 20, 2008 by [[Procrastinate! Music Traitors]]. Several new demos were featured on Devine's [[MySpace]] page around this time. A majority of the demos would later be properly featured on ''[[Brother's Blood]]'' and a single for "[[Another Bag of Bones]]" was released in August 2008. The tours throughout 2008 were in support of both the ''Put Your Ghost To Rest'' re-release and his new material.

In December 2008, Devine announced in an interview with [[Popwreckoning]] that his new album ''[[Brother's Blood]]'' would be released on April 28<ref name="Brother's Blood release date">{{cite web |url=http://popwreckoning.com/2009/02/05/interview-with-kevin-devine-pt-i/ |title=Interview with: Kevin Devine, pt.

He also announced a tour with [[Manchester Orchestra]] and the release of the ''[[I Could Be With Anyone]]'' EP in support of the upcoming album.<ref>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=7962394&blogId=481498034 PRE-ORDER "BROTHER'S BLOOD"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref>

He toured extensively in 2009–2010 for ''Brother's Blood'', including dates with Manchester Orchestra, Brand New, [[Thrice]], and [[Nada Surf]]. He also played a number of major music festivals, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, The Bamboozle and Bonnaroo. On July 6, 2010, Devine released the ''[[She Stayed As Steam]]'' EP, featuring outtakes from ''[[Brother's Blood]]''.

In an interview with [[Manchester Orchestra]]'s [[Andy Hull]], Hull confirmed that Manchester Orchestra and Kevin Devine would be releasing a split EP entitled "[[I Could Be The Only One]]".<ref>[http://blueindianmedia.blogspot.com/2009/12/10-questions-with-andy-hull-front-man.html 10 Questions with Andy Hull, front-man of Manchester Orchestra] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221062346/http://blueindianmedia.blogspot.com/2009/12/10-questions-with-andy-hull-front-man.html |date=December 21, 2009 }}</ref> He later confirmed in a January 2010 interview with [[AbsolutePunk]] that Manchester Orchestra and Devine had finished a currently untitled album featuring eight songs,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.today/20120717163130/http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1526011|title = Manchester Orchestra - 01.21.10 - Interview - AbsolutePunk.net}}</ref> with four songs written by Devine and the other four written by Hull.<ref>[http://pressrecordonline.squarespace.com/interviews/2010/3/23/kevin-devine.html Kevin Devine – Press Record Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328130847/http://pressrecordonline.squarespace.com/interviews/2010/3/23/kevin-devine.html |date=March 28, 2010 }}</ref> The album was to be released under the band name [[Bad Books]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100414163150/http://www.altpress.com/features/mo_badbooks.htm]</ref> In August 2010, the band officially announced their self-titled debut album ''[[Bad Books (album)|Bad Books]]'' would be released on October 19, 2010.

===''Between the Concrete and Clouds'' (2010–2012)===
On August 26, 2010, Devine announced on his Facebook page that he had begun writing his sixth album. A post made on his Facebook page also revealed tentative song titles which included "Between the concrete & clouds," "The first hit," "Off-screen," "A story, a sneak," "The city has left you," "11–17," "I used to be someone," "Sleepwalking through my life," "Wait out the wreck," and "Merry Levov". (The song "Merry Levov" was possibly renamed "Awake in the dirt", as it does not appear on the album yet would explain the lyrical content of the later renaming.) Several rough draft lyrics of these songs were added to his Facebook notes page.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100108160512/http://www.facebook.com/?ref=home#!/notes.php?id=9365212339&notes_tab=app_2347471856]</ref> Recording was completed on March 6, 2011. ''Between the Concrete and the Clouds'' is the first record made by Devine that is fully backed by a band, featuring musicians Brian Bonz (keyboard), Chris Bracco (a.k.a. Plosive) (bass, keyboard), Mike Fadem (drums, percussion), Russell Smith (electric guitar), and Mike Strandberg (guitar, mandolin). It was recorded in 10 days over a span of a month, produced by longtime collaborator Chris Bracco and mixed by [[Rob Schnapf]].

In March 2011 Devine toured with [[River City Extension]], and released a split 7" EP. Devine's songs on the EP are an acoustic version of "Between the Concrete and Clouds" and "Walls", a [[Tom Petty]] cover.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110427215123/http://www.altpress.com/reviews/entry/river_city_extension_kevin_devine_-_split_ep/]</ref>

Two 7" singles, "Luxembourg" and "Part of the Whole", were released on May 17, with the album ''Between the Concrete and Clouds'' to follow later in the year.<ref>{{cite web|author=posted |url=http://www.pluginmusic.com/news/article/kevin-devine-returns-with-two-7-singles-just-prior-to-new-lp-this-fall |title=Kevin Devine Returns With Two 7" Singles Just Prior To New LP This Fall (April 26, 2011) : News |website=PlugInMusic.com |date=April 26, 2011 |access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref>

During an Alt Press interview on July 6, 2011, ''Between The Concrete and the Clouds'' was officially announced for a September 13, 2011 release in the US on Razor & Tie/Favorite Gentlemen Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/kevin_devine_signs_to_razor_tie_announces_tour_dates|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111130230513/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/kevin_devine_signs_to_razor_tie_announces_tour_dates|archive-date=November 30, 2011|title=Alternative Press &#124; News &#124; Kevin Devine signs to Razor & Tie, announces tour dates}}</ref> He performed some of his new material on tour starting in spring 2010. A few songs on the album (most notably "Awake in the Dirt") are influenced by the book [[American Pastoral]] by Phillip Roth.

In honor of the 20th anniversary of Nirvana's classic album ''Nevermind'', Kevin Devine covered the entire album, and let fans download it on his website for free.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kevindevine.net/ |title=Kevin Devine |website=Kevindevine.net |access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref>

===''Bubblegum'' and ''Bulldozer'' (2012–2016)===
On January 14, 2013, Devine launched a [[Kickstarter]] campaign to help fund his next two albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/958123444/making-lp7-kd-w-rob-schnapf-and-lp8-kd-gdb-w-jesse |title=Making LP7 (KD w/ Rob Schnapf) & LP8 (KD+GDB w/ Jesse Lacey) by Kevin Devine |website=Kickstarter.com |access-date=March 17, 2020}}</ref> Later that day, it was announced the entire goal amount was raised, and on February 28, when the project finished being funded, fans of Kevin Devine had pledged $114,805 (USD).<ref>[https://archive.today/20130413164929/http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3064791]</ref> Both albums were released in the United States on October 15, 2013 via Devinyl Records/Favorite Gentlemen/Procrastinate!
