Kocky Wood and Rosario "Tiyang Saring" Nobleza. His mother was well known in Buhi and neighboring towns for selling herbal medications and perfumes.

==Musical career==
Wood's voice earned him various titles, including Jukebox King and Plaka King{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} in the 1970s when his career bloomed.

In 1972, Wood released his third album ''In Despair''. He became a very popular singer of that era and recorded many albums for Vicor Records. ''In Despair'' is an album of [[cover version]]s of popular English songs from the 1950s and 1960s. Three songs on the album, namely "[[Jenny, Jenny|Jenny Jenny]]", "[[Rip It Up (Little Richard song)|Rip It Up]]" and "[[Good Golly Miss Molly]]", were originally hits for Little Richard in the 1950s. The album has a combination of slow and fast songs, and the slow ballads include "In Despair", "Vaya Con Dios", "Have a Good Time", "Hurt" and "Return to Me". The album's ballads are highly favorable to karaoke singing, and a number of them are still heard in karaoke nightspots. Among the album's upbeat songs are versions of Roy Orbison's "[[Oh, Pretty Woman|Pretty Woman]]", Gene Vincent's "[[Be-Bop-a-Lula]]" and Del Shannon's "[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]".

In 1974 Wood released his eleventh album, ''Ihilak''. Eleven of the album's 12 songs are Philippine folk love songs sung in the [[Visayan language]]. The remaining song, "Gugma Ko", uses the melody of Neil Diamond's "[[Song Sung Blue]]" and replaces the original English lyrics with Visayan-language ones.

In 1979, Victor covered the Indonesian version of "Anak" from the fellow Filipino original artist Freddie Aguilar. 

Wood and his family migrated to the United States in the late 1970s. {{fact|date=April 2021}}
