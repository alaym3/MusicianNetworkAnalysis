== History ==

=== 1994–1999 ===
The band Okean Elzy was founded in 1994 by four young men from [[Lviv]]; who were former members of the band Klan Tyshi ({{lang-uk|Клан тиші}}, translation: ''Clan of Silence'') which was founded in 1991.<ref name=OkeEKP25113>[http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/people/pavlo-gudimov-talks-about-life-away-from-okean-elzy-319326.html Pavlo Gudimov talks about life away from Okean Elzy], [[Kyiv Post]] (25 January 2013)</ref> The original line-up featured a lead vocal, lead guitar, bass guitar and drums. Throughout 1994 the band spent their time rehearsing.

Their first concert took place in front of the [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera Theatre]] on 14 January 1995. Shortly after that appearance they released a demo tape called 'DEMO 94-95'. In 1995 they also  participated for the first time in the two biggest (at the time) Ukrainian music festivals - [[Chervona Ruta (festival)|Chervona Ruta]] and [[Melodiya (festival)|Melodiya]], also participated in ''Is'', a personal project of Lviv musician [[Oleg Sook]], performed the song Long time ago.<ref name=OkeEKP25113>[http://www.kyivpost.com/guide/people/pavlo-gudimov-talks-about-life-away-from-okean-elzy-319326.html Pavlo Gudimov talks about life away from Okean Elzy], [[Kyiv Post]] (25 January 2013)</ref>

In 1996 the band establish themselves on the festival circuit in Ukraine and beyond. Okean Elzy participated at Sribna Pidkova Festival, Alternative 2, Perlyny Sezonu, Tavriyski Ihry, Trust Open Air Gernsbach (Germany), Trash 96, and R.F.I. 96 (France).

In 1996 Okean Elzy also held their first concert outside Lviv. Their first appearance in the capital [[Kyiv]] took place in 1996 where they supported [[Deep Purple]]. In November–December of that year they recorded and released the group's first maxi-single {{Lang|uk|Budynok zi skla}} ("House of glass"). Shortly afterwards the first movie about the group was made by the TV channel [[TET (TV channel)|TET]] and was broadcast nationally.

1997 saw tours in the south of France and in the west of Germany. Back to Ukraine they held a concert in their hometown of Lviv, drawing massive crowds.

The band's big break came in 1998, when they made the decision to move to [[Kyiv]]. There they started working on their first album ''[[Tam, de nas nema]]'' ("There, where we are not"). The group's first music video was recorded for the song "{{Lang|uk|Tam, de nas nema|italic=no}}". This video was the first piece of modern [[Ukrainian music]] to make its mark on [[MTV Russia]], as well as France's [[MCM (TV channel)|MCM]] Channel.

At the very beginning of 1999, Okean Elzy started working on their second album {{Lang|uk|Ya na nebi buv}} ("I was in the sky"). In May the group decided to try to expand their fan base into Russia. Their first concert was at the festival [[Maxidrom]]. There were thousands of people there who already knew their songs, with many singing along.

On 16 September they played a solo concert at the MCM Cafe in [[Paris]].

=== 2000–2004 ===
In 2000, exactly one year after they started working on the album, {{Lang|uk|Ya na nebi buv}} was released.

On 5 February Okean Elzy held a solo concert at the legendary [[London Astoria|Astoria Club]] ([[London]]). In March the keyboard player joined the band.

In 2001 Okean Elzy became the new face of [[Pepsi Cola]] in Ukraine as the new millennium dawned. They released their third album ''Model''. The band launched a big tour around Ukraine called "Ask For More". In August they started working on their fourth album—''[[Supersymetriya]]'' ("Supersymmetry"). The album was eventually released in 2003 and immediately the group embarked on their biggest tour ever.

At the end of 2003 [[Svyatoslav Vakarchuk]], as the frontman of the band, became an official Ambassador of Ukrainian Culture.

In 2004 [[Denys Dudko]] (Ukrainian jazz bass player) and [[Miloš Jelić]] (composer from [[Novi Sad]], [[Serbia]]) joined the band.

On September 22, 2005, Okean Elzy released their new album ''[[Gloria (Okean Elzy album)|GLORIA]]''. After that the band went on tour (30 cities in Ukraine and 10 in Russia) with an audio crew consisting of Sergey Kamenev, Alexandr Kostin, [[Yurii Barybin]] and Vyacheslav Lavrinenko.

In September 2005, Vakarchuk became the UN's [[Goodwill Ambassador|Ambassador of Good Will]].

The project's aim is to draw the attention of young people to books and help fight illiteracy.

In November 2006, Okean Elzy visited [[Kosovo]], where musicians had a concert for [[peacemakers]] from Ukraine, Poland, Germany, United States and other countries, which included an international contingent of peacemakers.

During the Football World Cup 2006 in Germany, Okean Elzy actively supported the Ukrainian national team and cheered the fans with their songs. The last song of the band called {{Lang|uk|Veseli, brate, chasy nastaly}}''...'' ("Oh, brother, merry times came...") made a huge splash in Ukraine. The song and the video were released as a single and all profits were donated to the child care center treating [[AIDS]]. Charity activities play a major role in OE's life.

In April 2006 OE went on tour, which includes [[Chicago]], [[New York City]] and [[Toronto]], where thousands sang along to their songs.

On April 25, 2007, Okean Elzy released a new album, {{Lang|uk|Mira}} ("Measure"). After that the band went on a huge nationwide tour. During the month they held concerts in 27 Ukrainian cities. All of the concerts were held in large cities, mostly at stadiums and sporting arenas. The concerts were attended by more than 120,000 fans, which set a record for the group. For the two Kiev concerts, the attendance was about 24,000 total.
