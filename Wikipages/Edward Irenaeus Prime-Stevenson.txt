==Biography==
Edward Prime Stevenson was born on January 29, 1858, in [[Madison, New Jersey]].<ref name="Before Stonewall"/> His father, Paul E. Stevenson, was a [[Presbyterian]] minister and a school principal; his mother, Cornelia, came from the Prime family of distinguished literary and academic figures.<ref name="Before Stonewall"/>

After studying [[law]], Stevenson decided to become a writer and a journalist.<ref name="Before Stonewall"/> In 1901 he moved to Europe, living in Florence and Lausanne, where he died of a heart attack in 1942.

In 1896 Stevenson published ''The Square of Sevens, and the Parallelogram: An Authoritative Method of Cartomancy with a Prefatory Note'' by Robert Antrobus that was supposedly written in 1735. However, it is believed that he was the author.

In 1906, under the pseudonym Xavier Mayne, Stevenson published the homosexually themed novel ''[[Imre: A Memorandum]]'', and in 1908 a sexology study, ''[[The Intersexes]]'',<ref name="Before Stonewall"/> a defense of homosexuality from a scientific, legal, historical, and personal perspective.
