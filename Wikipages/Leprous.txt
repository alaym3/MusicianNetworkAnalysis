'''Leprous''' is a [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Notodden]], [[Norway]], formed in 2001. The group was founded by singer and keyboardist Einar Solberg and guitarist Tor Oddmund Suhrke.

After releasing several demos with relatively unstable lineups, the band released their first studio album, ''[[Tall Poppy Syndrome (album)|Tall Poppy Syndrome]]'', in 2009. They subsequently gained prominence as the live backing band of [[Ihsahn]] (who is Solberg's [[Sibling-in-law|brother-in-law]]), who, in turn, contributed on several Leprous records as guest singer or producer.<ref name="MU Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=70951|title=Einar Solberg Of Leprous Talks New Album ''Bilateral'', Working With Ihsahn, And More|last=Arthur|first=Ty|date=18 August 2011|website=Metal Underground|access-date=16 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|last=Christopher Monger|first=James|title=Leprous Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/leprous-mn0001066753/biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/leprous-tap-ihsahn-wife-to-produce-new-disc/|title=Leprous Tap Ihsahn, Wife To Produce New Disc|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=3 December 2012|website=Gun Shy Assassin|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820053408/https://gunshyassassin.com/news/leprous-tap-ihsahn-wife-to-produce-new-disc/|archive-date=20 August 2013|url-status=usurped|access-date=16 June 2013}}</ref> Their acclaimed 2011 album ''[[Bilateral (album)|Bilateral]]'' led to further attention.

==History==
The band's roster solidified by the time they recorded their debut album, ''[[Tall Poppy Syndrome (Leprous album)|Tall Poppy Syndrome]]'' in August 2008. American label Sensory Records signed the band and released the album in May 2009. Alex Henderson of [[AllMusic]] praised the band's debut for moving past the "staunchly pre-90s mentality" of contemporary progressive metal by blending the influence of [[Pink Floyd]] and [[King Crimson]] with alternative metal bands such as [[Tool (band)|Tool]].<ref name="Allmusic TPS">{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Alex|title=Leprous: Tall Poppy Syndrome|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tall-poppy-syndrome-mw0000817270|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=16 June 2013}}</ref>

On 20 May 2013, Leprous released ''[[Coal (Leprous album)|Coal]]''.  Vocalist Einar Solberg described the album as "a more melancholic and darker album than the more playful ''Bilateral''. By darker, I don't mean more aggressive, but more severe. There is still a big range in the dynamics, but no jumping between different moods within a song."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leprous.net/band.html|title=Band Biography|website=Leprous|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103023611/https://www.leprous.net/band.html|archive-date=3 November 2013|access-date=16 June 2013}}</ref>

On 5 May 2014, the band announced the departure of drummer Tobias Ørnes Andersen. He was replaced by Baard Kolstad, who played with Leprous throughout their 2013 Coal tour. The statement also revealed that the band was working on material for their next album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leprous.net/news.html|title=Departure of Tobias Ørnes Andersen|website=Leprous|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100522061616/https://www.leprous.net/news.html|archive-date=22 May 2010|access-date=5 May 2014}}</ref>

Leprous continued to regularly perform live throughout 2020 and 2021, with the events streamed online from their home town of Notodden. This included performances of each of their studio albums (except [[Tall Poppy Syndrome (album)|''Tall Poppy Syndrome'']]) in full, including multiple live debuts and many songs performed for the first time with the band's current lineup.

On 9 June 2021, Leprous announced their seventh studio album [[Aphelion (Leprous album)|''Aphelion'']], with a release date of 28 August 2021''.''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2021-06-09|title=LEPROUS Announces New Studio Album 'Aphelion'|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/leprous-announces-new-studio-album-aphelion/|access-date=2021-06-21|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> The band announced that the first single from ''Aphelion'' will be released on 26 June 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|title=https://twitter.com/leprousband/status/1402634220850319365|url=https://twitter.com/leprousband/status/1402634220850319365|access-date=2021-06-21|website=Twitter|language=en}}</ref>

While all the members contribute to Leprous' music, Tor Oddmund Suhrke (guitarist) has penned most of the lyrics, and Einar Solberg (singer and keyboardist) composes the backbone for most of their songs; both are the only constant members in the band's line-up.<ref name=ug>{{cite web|access-date=10 June 2020|title='We Are Our Own Worst Critics' - An Interview With Leprous' Tor Oddmund Suhrke|publication-date=1 August 2016|first=Steven |last=Rosen|website=[[Ultimate Guitar]]|quote=... there has never been any rules in Leprous when it comes to who being allowed to contribute to writing music or lyrics, but it's true that I wrote approximately half of the lyrics on ''Tall Poppy Syndrome'' together with our former bass player Halvor, all the lyrics on ''Bilateral'' and almost all lyrics on ''Coal'' except for "The Cloak" which is written by Einar.

The use of [[eight-string guitar]] has been a consistent element of the band's style. Contrary to the prevalent uses in modern progressive metal and [[djent]], Tor Oddmund Suhrke's playing style includes the use of complex chords in a variety of alternate [[guitar tunings]] (often necessitated by the fact the chord progressions are originally written by Einar Solberg on keyboard). As of ''[[Pitfalls]]'', the use of eight-string guitars has decreased; instead, it is the first album to feature acoustic guitars, as well as band members rotating to perform additional keyboards and percussion live.

Solberg claims inspiration from [[Radiohead]], [[Massive Attack]], [[Arvo Pärt]], [[Susanne Sundfør]], [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], and [[The Prodigy]] in addition to more analogous progressive bands such as [[Porcupine Tree]] and [[The Dillinger Escape Plan]].<ref name="noisefull influences"/> For his part, Suhrke cited [[The Mars Volta]]'s [[Omar Rodríguez-López]], [[Opeth]]'s [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]], Porcupine Tree's [[Steven Wilson]], and The Dillinger Escape Plan's [[Ben Weinman]] as his four biggest guitar influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalpaths.com/interviews/2015/09/01/interview-leprous-tor-oddmund-suhrke/|title=Interview: Leprous (Tor Oddmund Suhrke)|last=Koran|first=Andrew|date=1 September 2015|website=Metal Paths|access-date=5 December 2017}}</ref>
