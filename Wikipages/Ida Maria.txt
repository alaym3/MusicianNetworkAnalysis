{{cquote|I don't know what life's like without it, as I've always had it. As I've gotten older, I've seen that it has definitely been a bonus in terms of what I do. When I started to play guitar, I made this colour sheet for all the chords. I didn't know what they were called, but I knew exactly what colours and shades they were. So I made songs with colour palettes, which was really cool.<ref>Doug Johnstone, [http://www.list.co.uk/article/8569-ida-maria/ Ida Maria - She’s a rainbow], ''The List'', 22 May 2008</ref>}}
