==History==
[[File:Sleaford Mods 2019 Glastonbury Festival 06 crop.jpg|thumb|Jason Williamson, Sleaford Mods, [[Glastonbury Festival]], 2019]]
Williamson (born 10 November 1970 in [[Grantham]], [[Lincolnshire]]) grew up in Grantham.<ref name=guardian/> Inspired by the [[mod subculture]] and musical sources like the [[Wu-Tang Clan]], he spent several years pursuing music unsuccessfully, both with various groups and as a solo singer-songwriter. He had also worked as a session musician with local artists as well as [[Spiritualized]] and [[Bent (band)|Bent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundclick.com/bands/default.cfm?bandID=528066|title=SoundClick artist: Unity Crescent |work=SoundClick}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www5.bandspace.com/unitycrescent/|title=Unity Crescent @ BandSpace|website=5.bandspace.com}}</ref> Fearn (born 1971 in [[Burton upon Trent]]) grew up on a farm in [[Saxilby]], Lincolnshire.<ref name=guardian/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nottinghampost.com/Interview-Sleaford-Mods/story-22897417-detail/story.html |title="I swear too much but I can't help it" – the Sleaford Mods interview |date=9 September 2014 |first=Amelia |last=Ellis |newspaper=[[Nottingham Post]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929180425/http://www.nottinghampost.com/Interview-Sleaford-Mods/story-22897417-detail/story.html |archive-date=29 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Williamson first met Fearn in 2009 after hearing him DJ at a small Nottingham club called the Chameleon, where he was playing his own rough-edged and minimal [[grime (music)|grime]]-inspired tracks.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/05/sleaford-mods-interview-key-markets|title=Sleaford Mods: 'The thing is, there really is no future for a lot of people out there'|first=Sean|last=O'Hagan|date=5 July 2015|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Sleaford Mods began when Williamson's friend suggested he combine his vocals with a music sample from a [[Roni Size]] album.<ref name=guardian/> Originally, the project was called "That's Shit, Try Harder",<ref name=guardian/> but was later changed in reference to [[Sleaford]], a town in Lincolnshire, not far from Grantham.

Williamson formed the band with Simon Parfrement, whom he worked with alongside a studio engineer at Rubber Biscuit Studio in Nottingham on their first four albums. Parfrement left the music production to Andrew Fearn after the release of the 2012 album ''Wank'', the first album to feature Fearn, but Parfrement continues to play an important role with the band as their photographer and media producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sleafordmods.bandcamp.com/album/wank|title=Wank – Sleaford Mods|date=1 March 2012|work=Sleaford Mods|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109120750/http://sleafordmods.bandcamp.com/album/wank|archive-date=9 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sabotagetimes.com/music/dont-suffer-the-bullshit-heres-sleaford-mods/|title=Don't Suffer The Bullshit: Here's Sleaford Mods|work=Sabotage Times |first=Carl |last=Stanley |date=16 September 2014 |access-date=15 August 2015}}</ref>

A collaboration between Sleaford Mods and [[The Prodigy]] was announced at the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Prodigy and Sleaford Mods record new track 'Ibiza' |first=Lisa |last=Wright |url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-prodigy/80340 |website=[[NME]] |access-date=26 March 2015 |date=13 October 2014}}</ref> They recorded a track together, "Ibiza", which appears on The Prodigy album ''[[The Day Is My Enemy]]'', released in March 2015.

The [[Leftfield]] album ''[[Alternative Light Source]]'', released on 8 June 2015, also features a collaboration with Sleaford Mods, a track called "Head and Shoulders".<ref>{{cite web |title=Leftfield are releasing a new record, their first in 16 years |url=http://www.loudandquiet.com/2015/03/leftfield-are-releasing-a-new-record-their-first-in-16-years/ |first=Mandy |last=Drake |website=[[Loud and Quiet]] |access-date=26 March 2015 |date=25 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402061211/http://www.loudandquiet.com/2015/03/leftfield-are-releasing-a-new-record-their-first-in-16-years/ |archive-date=2 April 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The video for "Head and Shoulders" is a stop-motion/animation hybrid that debuted in August 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Leftfield and Sleaford Mods share new video for 'Head And Shoulders' |first=Kimberley-Marie |last=Sklinar Green |url=http://www.neverenoughnotes.co.uk/2015/08/leftfield-and-sleaford-mods-share-new-video-for-head-and-shoulders|access-date=6 August 2015|publisher=Never Enough Notes|date=6 August 2015|ref=Never Enough Notes}}</ref> In July 2015, the band released a new album, ''[[Key Markets]]''. It was one of the 19 records nominated for the IMPALA Album of the Year Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://impalamusic.org/content/young-labels-featured-shortlist-impala-album-year-award | title=Young labels featured in shortlist for IMPALA Album of the Year Award | website=Impalamusic.org}}</ref>

The band featured in two documentary films, ''[[Sleaford Mods: Invisible Britain]]'', released in 2015 and ''[[Bunch of Kunst|Bunch of Kunst. A Film About Sleaford Mods]]'', released in 2017.

In 2016, an important turning point took place after many years, as Sleaford Mods left Harbinger Sound and signed with [[Rough Trade Records]]. Their first release on the new label was the ''T.C.R.'' EP in 2016.

In 2017, following the release of ''[[English Tapas]]'', Sleaford Mods embarked on their first North American tour.

One year later, Sleaford Mods left Rough Trade, which eventually led to the dismissal of their long-time manager (and owner of Harbinger Records), Steve Underwood.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ox-fanzine.de/interview/sleaford-mods-6714|title=All mod cons|work=[[Ox-Fanzine]] |first=Joachim|last=Hiller |date=April–May 2019 |access-date=28 December 2020}}</ref>

After releasing ''[[Eton Alive]]'' on their own label Extreme Eating Records in 2019, the band returned to Rough Trade. This renewed cooperation resulted in the release of the compilation ''[[All That Glue]]'' in 2020 and ''[[Spare Ribs]]'' in 2021 (including the single "[[Mork n Mindy]]", which was released on October 30, 2020, and reached the top of the UK vinyl singles chart).

In 2019, Williamson lent his vocals to the track "Talk Whiff" by [[Scorn (band)|Scorn]].
