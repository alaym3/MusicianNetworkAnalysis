'''Paul Maurice Kelly''' {{post-nominals|country=AUS|AO}} (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian rock music singer-songwriter and guitarist. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He has worked with other artists and groups, including associated projects [[Professor Ratbaggy]] and [[Stardust Five]]. Kelly's music style has ranged from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] to studio-oriented [[dub music|dub]] [[reggae]], but his core output straddles [[folk music|folk]], rock, and [[country music|country]]. His lyrics capture the vastness of the culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. [[David Fricke]] from ''[[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]]'' calls Kelly "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise."<ref name="Fricke"/> Kelly has said, "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet".<ref name="Biog1997"/>

After growing up in [[Adelaide]], Kelly travelled around Australia before settling in [[Melbourne]] in 1976. He became involved in the [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub rock]] scene and drug culture, and recorded two albums with Paul Kelly and the Dots. Kelly moved to Sydney by 1985, where he formed Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls. The band was renamed Paul Kelly and the Messengers, initially only for international releases, to avoid possible racial interpretations of the word "coloured". At the end of the 1980s, Kelly returned to Melbourne, and in 1991 he disbanded the Messengers. Kelly was married and divorced twice; he has three children and resides in [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]], a suburb of Melbourne. 

[[Dan Kelly (musician)|Dan Kelly]], his nephew, is a singer and guitarist in his own right. Dan performed with Kelly on ''Ways and Means'' and ''Stolen Apples''. Both were members of Stardust Five, which released a [[Stardust Five (album)|self-titled album]] in 2006. On 22 September 2010 Kelly released his memoir, ''How to Make Gravy'', which he described as "it's not traditional; it's writing around the A–Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order". His biographical film, ''[[Paul Kelly: Stories of Me]]'', directed by [[Ian Darling]], was released to cinemas in October 2012.

Kelly's Top 40 singles include "[[Billy Baxter (song)|Billy Baxter]]", "[[Before Too Long]]", "[[Darling It Hurts]]", "[[To Her Door]]" (his highest-charting local hit in 1987), "[[Dumb Things]]" (appeared on United States charts in 1988), and "[[Roll on Summer]]". Top-20 albums include ''[[Gossip (Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls album)|Gossip]]'', ''[[Under the Sun (Paul Kelly album)|Under the Sun]]'', ''[[Comedy (Paul Kelly & The Messengers album)|Comedy]]'', ''[[Songs from the South]]'' (1997 [[compilation album|compilation]]), ''[[...Nothing but a Dream]]'', ''[[Stolen Apples (album)|Stolen Apples]]'', ''[[Spring and Fall (album)|Spring and Fall]]'', ''[[The Merri Soul Sessions]]'', ''Seven Sonnets and a Song'', ''Death's Dateless Night'' (with [[Charlie Owen (musician)|Charlie Owen]]), ''[[Life Is Fine]]'' – his first number-one album – and ''[[Nature (Paul Kelly album)|Nature]]''. Kelly has won 14 [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) Music Awards, including his induction into their [[ARIA Music Awards of 1997#Hall of Fame Inductees|Hall of Fame in 1997]].

In 2001, the [[Australasian Performing Right Association]] (APRA) listed the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs|Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time, which included Kelly's "To Her Door", and "[[Treaty (song)|Treaty]]", written by Kelly and members of [[Yothu Yindi]]. Aside from "Treaty", Kelly wrote or co-wrote several songs on [[Indigenous Australian]] social issues and historical events. He provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. The album ''Women at the Well'' from 2002 had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute. 

Kelly was appointed as an [[Order of Australia|Officer of the Order of Australia]] in 2017 for distinguished service to the performing arts and to the promotion of the national identity through contributions as a singer, songwriter and musician.<ref name=AO/>

==Early life==

Paul Maurice Kelly was born on 13 January 1955 in [[Adelaide]], to John Erwin Kelly, a lawyer, and Josephine (née Filippini), the sixth of eight surviving children.<ref name="Spirited Men115"/><ref name="KellyBio"/> According to ''[[Rip It Up (magazine)|Rip It Up]]'' magazine, "legend has it" that Kelly's mother gave birth to him "in a taxi outside North Adelaide's Calvary Hospital".<ref name="Rip"/>

Although Kelly was raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], he later described himself as a non-believer in any religion.<ref name="KellyGravy190"/><ref name="Courier"/> He is the great-great-grandson of Jeremiah Kelly, who emigrated from Ireland in 1852 and settled in [[Clare, South Australia]].<ref name="Spirited Men116"/> His paternal grandfather, Francis Kelly, established a law firm in 1917, which his father, John, joined in 1937.<ref name="Lawyers"/> 

John Kelly died in 1968 at the age of 52, after having been diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] three years earlier.<ref name="KellyGravy223"/> Paul Kelly was thirteen years old when his father died.<ref name="Rope"/> Kelly described his father: "I have good memories, he was the kind of father that, well, I missed him when he died very much. The older children were growing into him at the time he died. He was not well enough to play sport with me."<ref name="Lure"/><ref name="KellyGravy10"/>

Kelly's maternal grandfather was an [[Argentine]]-born, Italian-speaking [[opera singer]], Count Ercole Filippini, a leading [[baritone]] for the [[La Scala]] Opera Company in [[Milan]].<ref name="Leser204"/> 

Filippini was touring Australia in 1914 with a Spanish opera company when [[World War I]] broke out; Filippini stayed and later married Anne McPharland, one of his students.<ref name="Spirited Men116"/> As Countessa Anne Filippini, she was Australia's first female symphony orchestra conductor.<ref name="Lure"/> She sang the role of Marguerite in [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) Radio [[Perth]]'s performance of ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' in 1928.<ref name="Leser204" /> 

Kelly's grandparents started the Italo-Australian Opera Company, which toured the country in the 1920s.<ref name="Italian"/>

Josephine raised the younger children alone after John's death, but found time to assist others in need.<ref name="Rope"/> Paul's oldest sister, Anne, became a nun and went on to write hymns, while a younger sister, Mary-Jo, plays piano in Latin bands and teaches music.<ref name="Songline"/><ref name="VCASS"/> 

An older brother, Martin, works for [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Edmund Rice International]],<ref name="ABCQ"/><ref name="Edmund"/> with another brother, Tony, a drug and alcohol counsellor, who ran as an [[Australian Greens]] candidate in the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001]] and [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal elections]].<ref name="Bunworth"/><ref name="Greens"/> Josephine Kelly moved to [[Brisbane]], where she died in 2000 at the age of 76.<ref name="KellyGravy308"/>

Kelly attended [[Rostrevor College]], a Christian Brothers school, where he played trumpet and studied piano, became the first XI cricket captain, played in the first XVIII football (Australian rules), and was named [[Dux (education)|dux]] of his senior year.<ref name="apra02"/><ref name="WRecords"/> He studied arts at [[Flinders University]] in 1973, but left after a term, disillusioned with academic life. He began writing prose and started a magazine with some friends.<ref name="Insight"/> 

Kelly spent several years working odd jobs, travelling around the country and learning guitar before he moved to Melbourne in 1976.<ref name="Spirited Men118"/><ref name="McF"/>

==1974–1984: Early career and with the Dots==

[[File:Salamanca Market Hobart Tasmania.jpg|thumb|[[Salamanca Place]], [[Hobart]] (2007), where, in mid-1974, Kelly made his first public performance—a two-song set comprising [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[Girl from the North Country]]" and "[[Streets of Forbes]]", a traditional Australian folk song about [[bushranger]] [[Ben Hall (bushranger)|Ben Hall]].<ref name="KellyGravy16"/>|alt=An exterior night street scene which shows a row of galleries, shops and cafés beyond pedestrians and parked cars. A stretch of bricked roadway is in the foreground.]]  
While travelling around Australia, Paul Kelly made his first public performance in 1974 in [[Hobart]].<ref name="Songline" /><ref name="Howl"/> He later recalled:

{{quote|I was living there at the time and there was a folk club at Salamanca Place. They had a night, I think a Monday night, where anyone could get up. I sang [[Bob Dylan|Dylan]]'s "[[Girl from the North Country|Girl from North Country]]" and "[[Streets of Forbes]]", a traditional Australian song about [[Ben Hall (bushranger)|Ben Hall]]. I can't really remember how it went – I remember I had a lot to drink afterwards from relief. I was incredibly nervous.<ref name="jj"/>}}

His first published song, "It's the Falling Apart that Makes You", was written after listening to [[Van Morrison]]'s ''[[Astral Weeks]]'' at the age of 19,<ref name="apra02" /> although in an interview with ''Drum Media'' he recalled writing his first song: "It was an open-tuning and had four lines about catching trains. I have got a recording of it somewhere. It was called 'Catching a Train'. I wrote a lot of songs about trains early on, trains and fires, and then I moved on to water".<ref name="jj" /> In 1976, Kelly appeared on ''Debutantes'', a compilation album featuring various Melbourne-based artists, and joined [[Pub rock (Australia)|pub-rockers]] The High Rise Bombers from 1977 to 1978.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="ARDb"/> The High Rise Bombers included Kelly (vocals, guitar, songwriter), [[Martin Armiger]] (guitar, vocals, songwriter), Lee Cass (bass guitar), Chris Dyson (guitar), Sally Ford (saxophone, songwriter), John Lloyd (drums), and Keith Shadwick (saxophone).<ref name="SpencerHighRise"/> Chris Langman (guitar, vocals) replaced Dyson in early 1978. [Langman never played with the High Rise Bombers and is incorrectly listed as a guitarist on the ''Melbourne Club'' album]. In August, after Armiger left for [[The Sports]] and Ford for The Kevins, Kelly formed Paul Kelly and the Dots with Langman and Lloyd.<ref name="McF" /> The High Rise Bombers recorded two tracks, "She's Got It" and "Domestic Criminal", which appeared on ''The Melbourne Club'', a 1981 compilation by various artists on [[Missing Link Records]].<ref name="McF" />

Kelly had already established himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off.<ref name="NimmervollAllmusic"/> Richard Guilliatt, writing for ''[[The Monthly]]'', later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was "a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster".<ref name="Guilliatt"/> Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in "When I First Met Your Ma" (1992).<ref name="KellyGravy80"/><ref name="SMHSep2010"/> Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on "[[How to Make Gravy]]" (1996).<ref name="KellyGravy206"/> Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.<ref name="KellyGravy80" /><ref name="SMHSep2010" />

The Dots included [[Bands and accompanying musicians of Paul Kelly#Paul Kelly and the Dots (1978–1982)|various line-ups]] from 1978 to 1982.<ref name="SpencerPKDots"/> The band released their debut single "Recognition" in 1979, which did not reach the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart top&nbsp;50.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Kent"/> Paul Kelly and the Dots signed to [[Mushroom Records]] and issued "[[Billy Baxter (song)|Billy Baxter]]" in November 1980, which peaked at No.&nbsp;38.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Kent" /> Rock music historian, [[Ian McFarlane]] described it as a "delightful, ska-tinged" track.<ref name="McF" /> Kelly's first television performance was "Billy Baxter" on the national pop show ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''.<ref name="Carney"/> Their debut album, ''[[Talk (Paul Kelly album)|Talk]]'', followed in March 1981, which reached No.&nbsp;44 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart.<ref name="Kent" /> Late in 1981 Paul Kelly and the Dots recorded their second album, ''[[Manila (album)|Manila]]'', in the [[Philippines]]' [[Manila|capital]]. It was issued in August 1982, but had no chart success.<ref name="McF" /> Release was delayed by line-up changes and because Kelly was assaulted in Melbourne – he had his jaw broken.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Leser206"/>

In an October 1982 interview with ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]'', Kelly indicated he was more pleased with ''Manila'' than ''Talk'' as "It has more unity ... with this one we didn't have people dropping into the studio to play."<ref name="Moore"/> Years later Kelly disavowed both Dots albums: "I wish I could grab the other two and put 'em in a big hole".<ref name="Songline" /><ref name="Jeff"/> The 1982 film, ''[[Starstruck (1982 film)|Starstruck]]'', was directed by [[Gillian Armstrong]] and starred Jo Kennedy.<ref name="TVGuideStarstruck"/> Paul Kelly and the Dots supplied "Rocking Institution" for its soundtrack and Kelly added to the score.<ref name="TVMemStarstruck"/> Kennedy released "Body and Soul", a cover of [[Split Enz]]' "She Got Body, She Got Soul" as a [[Split album|shared single]] with "Rocking Institution".<ref name="TVMemStarstruck" /> Acting in a minor role in ''Starstruck'' was [[Kaarin Fairfax]], who later became Kelly's second wife.<ref name="Songline" /><ref name="TVGuideStarstruck" /> Kelly was without a recording contract after the Dots folded in 1982.<ref name="WRecords" />

Paul Kelly Band was formed in 1983 with [[Michael Armiger]] (Martin Armiger's younger brother, bass guitar), Chris Coyne (saxophone), [[Maurice Frawley]] (guitar) and Greg Martin (drums). By 1984 Michael Barclay (ex-[[the Zimmermen]]) replaced Martin on drums and [[Graham Lee (Australian musician)|Graham Lee]] (guitar, [[pedal steel guitar]]) joined.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="SpencerPKBand1983"/> Kelly's involvement in the Melbourne drug culture—he described his heroin addiction as "a long period of occasional use"—resulted in erratic performances.<ref name="Leser206" /> Problems with his marriage and drug use disrupted his career, and by 1984 the marriage had broken up. Hilary had moved to Sydney, initially leaving their young son with Kelly.<ref name="KellyGravy35"/> He disbanded the group three months later and relocated to Sydney so he could share parenting responsibilities with Hilary while Declan grew up.<ref name="Lure" /><ref name="NEAP"/>

Paul Kelly stayed with [[Don Walker (musician)|Don Walker]] ([[Cold Chisel]]) in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] – Walker had lived with Hilary's sister – and wrote new songs on Walker's piano.<ref name="KellyGravy182"/> Kelly then moved into a flat with Paul Hewson ([[Dragon (band)|Dragon]]) in [[Elizabeth Bay, New South Wales|Elizabeth Bay]].<ref name="SMHSep2010" /><ref name="Leser207"/> Both Walker and Hewson encouraged Kelly to continue with his song-writing.<ref name="KellyGravy182" /> By January 1985, he recorded the self-funded album—at a cost of $3,500—''[[Post (Paul Kelly album)|Post]]''.<ref name="Courier" /> Session musicians included Michael Barclay ([[Weddings Parties Anything]]) on harmonies, guitarist Steve Connolly (The Zimmermen), and bass guitarist [[Ian Rilen]] ([[Rose Tattoo]], [[X (Australian band)|X]]).<ref name="WRecords" /><ref name="Zimmer"/> They spent two weeks recording at [[Clive Shakespeare]]'s studio. Shakespeare engineered the album and co-produced with Kelly. It was released in May 1985 on the independent label White Records, and licensed to [[Mushroom Records]].<ref name="WRecords" /><ref name="Jeff" />

Kelly dedicated ''Post'' to his former flatmate, Hewson, who had died of a heroin overdose in January.<ref name="tribute"/><ref name="Dragon"/> According to McFarlane: "[it's] a stark, highly personalised collection of acoustic songs that showcased the extraordinary breadth of Kelly's songwriting skills."<ref name="McF" /> ''[[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]]'' (Australia) hailed ''Post'' as the best record of 1985.<ref name="Courier" /><ref name="Lure" /> [[AllMusic]]'s Mike DeGagne felt "While he focuses on life's daily tragedies and tribulations, there is a missing element in the music, as it lacks any vigor or flash".<ref name="DeGagne"/> A single, "From St. Kilda to King's Cross", was released from the album, but did not chart.<ref name="McF" /> [[Russell Crowe]], during his first trip to the US, visited the tourist venue of [[Death Valley, California|Death Valley]] and used ''Post'' to refocus himself: "[his] concise insights and acerbic wisdom are exactly the music for strolling the bottom of ancient oceans, both literal and metaphoric".<ref name="Jeff" /> After recording ''Post'', Kelly established a full-time band, which included Armiger, Barclay, and Connolly, bass guitarist Jon Schofield, and keyboardist Peter Bull.<ref name="SpencerPKCG"/>

Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls were named through a joke based on [[Lou Reed]]'s song "[[Walk on the Wild Side (Lou Reed song)|Walk on the Wild Side]]".<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Jeff" /> Armiger soon left, and the Coloured Girls line-up stabilised in late 1985 as Barclay, Bull, Connolly, and Schofield.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="ARDb" /> [[Stuart Coupe]], Kelly's manager, advised him to sign with [[Regular Records]] due to difficulty re-signing with Mushroom's [[Michael Gudinski]].<ref name="Jeff" /> Michelle Higgins, Mushroom's public relations officer, was a Kelly supporter and locked herself into a [[Sebel Townhouse Hotel]] room—at Mushroom's expense—for nearly a week in mid-1986, and refused to leave until Gudinski had signed Kelly to a two-album recording contract.<ref name="Jeff" /><ref name="SongsSouth"/> Kelly performed for The Rock Party, a charity project initiated by The National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which included other Australasian musicians. The Rock Party released a 12" single, "Everything to Live For", which was produced by Joe Wissert, Phil Rigger, and Phil Beazley.<ref name="AllMusicE2L4"/><ref name="rock party"/>

In September, Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls released a 24-track double [[LP record|LP]], ''[[Gossip (Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls album)|Gossip]]''.<ref name="ARDb" /> The album included remakes of four songs from ''Post'', and also featured "Maralinga (Rainy Land)", a song about the effects of [[British nuclear tests at Maralinga|British nuclear tests]] on the [[Maralinga Tjarutja]] ([[Indigenous Australian|indigenous]] people of [[Maralinga]], South Australia).<ref name="Songline" /><ref name="Howl" /> ''Gossip'' peaked at No.&nbsp;15, with singles chart success for "[[Before Too Long]]" which peaked at No.&nbsp;15, and "Darling It Hurts" which reached No.&nbsp;25.<ref name="Kent" /> A single LP version of ''Gossip'' featuring 15 songs was issued in the United States by [[A&M Records]] in July 1987.<ref name="ARDb" /> DeGagne noted that "[it] bursts at the seams with blustery, distinguished tunes captivating both the somberness and the intrigue thrown forward from this fine Australian storyteller".<ref name="DeGagneGossip"/>

''Gossip'' was co-produced by Kelly and Alan Thorne ([[Hoodoo Gurus]], [[The Stems]]) who, according to music journalist [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]] (former [[The Go-Betweens]] singer-songwriter), helped the band create "a sound that will not only influence future roots-rock bands but, through its directness, sparkle and dedication to the song, will also come to be seen as particularly Australian. Ultimately, it means the records these people made together are timeless".<ref name="Forster"/> Due to possible racist connotations, the band changed its name for international releases to Paul Kelly and the Messengers.<ref name="McF" /><ref name="Jeff" /> They made a US tour, initially supporting [[Crowded House]] and then headlining, travelling across the US by bus.<ref name="McF" /> "Darling It Hurts" peaked at No.&nbsp;19 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock chart]] in 1987.<ref name="BillS"/> ''[[The New York Times]]'' rock critic [[Jon Pareles]] wrote "Mr. Kelly sang one smart, catchy three-minute song after another – dozens of them – as the band played with no-frills directness" following the band's performance at the Bottom Line Club in New York.<ref name="Pareles"/>

Paul Kelly and the Coloured Girls' second album, ''[[Under the Sun (Paul Kelly album)|Under the Sun]]'', was released in late 1987 in Australia and New Zealand, and in early 1988 in North America and Europe (under the name Paul Kelly and the Messengers).<ref name="ARDb" /> On the Kent Music Report Albums Chart, it reached No.&nbsp;19. The lead single "[[To Her Door]]", written by Kelly, peaked at No.&nbsp;14 on the related singles chart.<ref name="Kent" /><ref name="APRA"/> Forster indicated that the song demonstrated one of Kelly's finest qualities as a songwriter which is his unforced empathy.<ref name="Forster" /> DeGagne observed a style similar to [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Steve Forbert]], and said the album provided "acoustically bright story songs and character-based tales with unlimited substance".<ref name="DeGagneUnder"/>

Another single, "[[Dumb Things]]", was released in early 1989 and attained No.&nbsp;36 on the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Charts|Singles Chart]].<ref name="AusCharts"/> In the US, it reached No.&nbsp;16 on the ''Billboard'' [[Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock chart]].<ref name="BillS" /> The song was included on the soundtrack for the 1988 [[Yahoo Serious]] film ''[[Young Einstein]]''.<ref name="YoungE"/> The video, directed by Claudia Castle, won an [[ARIA Music Awards of 1988|ARIA Award]] for 'Best Video'.<ref name="ARIAAwards"/><ref name="ARIAAwards1988"/> Kelly met Kaarin Fairfax, his second wife, in 1988 and they married in 1993.<ref name="Lure" /><ref name="Mordue1996"/> From 1989 to 1992 Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as country music artist Mary-Jo Starr, she released three singles and an album, ''Too Many Movies'', using the Messengers and Kelly as session musicians. Michael Armiger, Connolly, and Frawley were in her backing tour band, The Drive-in Motel.<ref name="ARDb" /><ref name="ARDbDriveIn"/> Fairfax and Kelly's two children are Madeleine (born 1991) and Memphis (born 1993).<ref name="Lure" />

''[[So Much Water So Close to Home]]'' was released in 1989 by Paul Kelly and the Messengers in all markets. It peaked at No.&nbsp;10 on the ARIA Albums Chart, but none of its singles reached the ARIA Top&nbsp;40 Singles Chart.<ref name="AusCharts" /> Forster stated that, with "Everything's Turning to White", Kelly shows mastery in condensing a [[Raymond Carver]] tale of fishermen who discover a dead woman's body but continue to fish before reporting their find.<ref name="Forster" /> The same short story was used for the 2006 film, ''[[Jindabyne (film)|Jindabyne]]'', for which Kelly composed the soundtrack.<ref name="MovieBio"/> DeGagne preferred "Everything's Turning to White" and "[[Sweet Guy]]" to the other album tracks, which "seem a little weak in the content department".<ref name="DeGagneWater"/> Kelly relocated back to Melbourne after having lived in Sydney for six years.<ref name="Lure" /><ref name="Songline" /> Another US tour was undertaken, but there was no further chart success for albums or singles released in the US market.<ref name="McF" />

In 1991 the band released ''[[Comedy (Paul Kelly & The Messengers album)|Comedy]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;12 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="AusCharts" /> DeGagne noticed "a folk-filled tinge to each song, but the occasional quickened pace balances out these tunes rather nicely".<ref name="DeGagneComedy"/> "[[From Little Things Big Things Grow]]", a seven-minute track from the album, was co-written by Kelly and [[Kev Carmody]].<ref name="APRA" /> It highlights the [[Gurindji Strike]] and [[Vincent Lingiari]] as part of the [[Indigenous Australian]] struggle for [[Indigenous land rights in Australia|land rights]] and [[reconciliation in Australia|reconciliation]].<ref name="McF" /><ref name="GNT"/> Forster indicates it has [[Dylanesque]] influences, and shows Kelly "honing the skills of a fine balladeer and storyteller".<ref name="Forster" /> A cover version that was released in May 2008 by The GetUp Mob, part of the [[GetUp!]] advocacy group, peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the ARIA singles charts.<ref name="AusChartsGetUp"/> This version included samples from speeches by [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers]] [[Paul Keating]] in 1992 and [[Kevin Rudd]] in 2008.<ref name="Morgan"/> It featured vocals by Carmody and Kelly, as well as other Australian artists. Kelly collaborated with members of indigenous band [[Yothu Yindi]] to write "[[Treaty (song)|Treaty]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;11 in September 1991.<ref name="AusChartsTreaty"/><ref name="ASCAP"/>

"To Her Door" and "Treaty" were voted into the [[APRA Top 30 Australian songs]] of all time in 2001.<ref name=apra01/> Paul Kelly and the Messengers gave their last performance in August 1991, with Kelly set to pursue a solo career.<ref name="McF" /> He justified his decision: "We forged a style together. But I felt if we had kept going it would have got formulaic and that's why I broke it up. I wanted to try and start moving into other areas, start mixing things up".<ref name="tribute" /> Paul Kelly and the Messengers' final album, ''[[Hidden Things]]'', was a collection of previously released B-sides, stray non-LP tracks, radio sessions, and other rarities. It was released in May 1992, and reached No.&nbsp;29.<ref name="AusCharts" /> One track, "Rally Around the Drum", written with [[Archie Roach]], was about an indigenous [[tent boxing]] man.<ref name="McF" />

Paul Kelly published his memoir, ''How to Make Gravy'', via [[Penguin Books|Penguin Books (Australia)]] on 22 September 2010.<ref name="Penguin" /> "It's a mongrel memoir. It's a bit hard to describe at the moment. It's not traditional; it's writing around the A-Z theme – I tell stories around the song lyrics in alphabetical order. It's slow, so it will be a while coming, but I'll get there".<ref name="Wanted Man"/> As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8×CD box set, ''[[A – Z Recordings]]'', with live performances from his A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010.<ref name="KellyGravyFly" /> The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights.

During February and March 2013, Kelly and Neil Finn undertook a collaborative tour of Australia.<ref name="Shedden 2013" /><ref name="Tour Dates" /> Their performance on 10 March at the Sydney Opera House was recorded for the live album, ''[[Goin' Your Way]]'' (8 November 2013).<ref name="Shedden 2013" /> It was issued as a 2× CD, which peaked at No.&nbsp;5 on the ARIA Albums Chart;<ref name="AUS Charts Your"/> and also as a DVD, which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the related ARIA Music DVD Chart.<ref name="ARIAReport 1238"/> Later in March, Kelly toured New Zealand with Dan Kelly to promote ''Spring and Fall'' by playing in church venues.<ref name="ter Ellen"/>

''Goin' Your Way'' was the first of several collaborative albums Kelly would release in the following years. ''[[The Merri Soul Sessions]]'' was released December 2014, and features contributions from the Bull sisters, [[Kira Puru]], Clairy Browne and [[Dan Sultan]]. The ensemble would also tour together in late 2014 and early 2015. In 2016, Kelly would release two albums: ''[[Seven Sonnets and a Song]]'' in April, which was a musical recreation of selected works by [[William Shakespeare]]; and ''[[Death's Dateless Night]]'' in October, a covers album with [[Charlie Owen (musician)|Charlie Owen]].

==2017–present: ''Life Is Fine'' and ''Nature''==
Kelly's first solo album in five years, ''[[Life Is Fine]]'', was released in August 2017.<ref name="AusCharts" /> The album became his first number-one album and won him four [[ARIA Music Awards of 2017|ARIA Awards]] at that year's ceremony.<ref name="AusCharts" /><ref name="Cockburn"/> In November and December 2017, Kelly and his band undertook a seventeen-performance tour of thirteen metropolitan and regional Australian cities, as well as four performances in three cities in New Zealand to promote the release of ''Life is Fine''.

In August 2018, Kelly announced the release of a new album, ''Nature'', in October. The album's lead single, "With the One I Love", was released on the same day.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paul Kelly to release new album Nature in October |url=http://doublej.net.au/news/music-news/paul-kelly-to-release-new-album-nature-in-october |website=Double J |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=9 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809060619/http://doublej.net.au/news/music-news/paul-kelly-to-release-new-album-nature-in-october |archive-date=9 August 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Kelly released a greatest hits album in November 2019, covering years 1985–2019, titled ''[[Songs from the South: 1985-2019]]''.

In September 2019, Kelly performed at the MCG in the Virgin Australia Pre-Game Show at the 2019 Toyota AFL Grand Final Day.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.afl.com.au/finals/events|title=Grand Final Entertainment|website=afl.com.au|language=en|access-date=2019-09-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190928040834/https://www.afl.com.au/finals/events|archive-date=28 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 5 February 2020, Kelly released a single titled, "Sleep, Australia, Sleep". The song addresses [[Climate change in Australia#Action on climate change|Australia's response to climate change]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/en_au/news/paul-kelly-addresses-climate-change-inaction-brand-new-song-sleep-australia-sleep-2605193|title=Paul Kelly addresses climate change inaction on brand-new song|website=[[NME]]|language=en|date=5 February 2020|access-date=19 February 2020|first=Anna|last=Rose}}</ref> Before the release of the single, the lyrics were published by [[The Sydney Morning Herald]], with Kelly describing the song as "a lament in the form of a lullaby. Paradoxically, it can also be heard as a wake up call - a critique of the widespread attitude amongst humans that we are the most important life form on the planet."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/paul-kelly-s-lament-for-the-fate-of-our-sleeping-nation-20200128-p53vef.html|title=Paul Kelly's lament for the fate of our 'sleeping' nation|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|language=en|date=30 January 2020|access-date=19 February 2020|first=Paul|last=Kelly}}</ref>

==Musical style and songwriting==
[[File:Paul Kelly 2007.jpg|thumb|Kelly with a harmonica in a cradle, Chill Island Festival, [[Phillip Island]], November 2007|alt=Kelly standing at a microphone, he is shown in right profile, wearing a harmonica in a cradle and staring into the distance.]]
Paul Kelly has been acknowledged as one of Australia's best singer-songwriters.<ref name="PowerH"/> His music style has ranged from [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] to studio-oriented [[dub music|dub]] [[reggae]], but his core output comfortably straddles [[folk music|folk]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], and [[country music|country]].<ref name="NEAP" /><ref name="Attfield"/> His lyrics capture Australia's vastness both in culture and landscape; he has chronicled life about him for over 30 years and is described as the [[poet laureate]] of Australia.<ref name="Rope" /><ref name="McF" /> According to music writer [[Glenn A. Baker]], his Australian-ness may be a reason Kelly has not achieved international success.<ref name="Songline" /> [[David Fricke]] from ''[[Rolling Stone Australia|Rolling Stone]]'' calls Kelly "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise."<ref name="Fricke" />

Fellow songwriter Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, "There is something unique and powerful about the way Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there".<ref name="Songline" /> Ross Clelland, writing for ''Rolling Stone'', described Kelly: "[W]hile he was (rightly) lauded for his ability to sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words".<ref name="Clelland"/> Tim Freedman ([[The Whitlams]]) acknowledges Kelly, [[Peter Garrett]] (Midnight Oil), and [[John Schumann]] ([[Redgum]]) as inspiring him by "[furnishing] our suburbs with our own myths and social history".<ref name="Mordue"/> However, Kelly has been quoted as saying "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like I have got it nailed yet".<ref name="Biog1997" /><ref name="Civics"/> In 2007 Kelly donated his [[Lee Oskar#Lee Oskar harmonica|'Lee Oskar']] harmonica to the Sydney [[Powerhouse Museum]]. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on ''Live, May 1992''.<ref name="PowerH" />
{{listen
|title="Foggy Highway"
|filename=Foggy Highway.ogg
|description=Paul Kelly recorded a version of "Foggy Highway" for ''[[Live, May 1992]]''. He re-recorded it with lead vocals by [[Renée Geyer]] for the various artists soundtrack ''[[Seven Deadly Sins (miniseries)|Seven Deadly Sins: Music from the ABC TV Series]]'' in 1993. This sample is the Geyer 1993 version.}}

Kelly described his songwriting as "a scavenging art, a desperate act. For me it's a bit from here, a bit from there, fumbling around, never quite knowing what you're doing ... Song writing is like a way of feeling connected to mystery."<ref name="jj" /> He has resisted the label of 'storyteller' and insists that his songs are not strictly autobiographical; "they come from imagining someone in a particular situation. Sometimes a sequence of events happens which makes it more a story, but other times it's just that situation".<ref name="apra02" /> Sometimes the same character is found in different songs, such as in "To Her Door", "Love Never Runs on Time", and "How to Make Gravy".<ref name="apra02" />

Kelly has also provided songs for many other artists, tailoring them to their particular vocal range. ''Women at the Well'' (2002) had 14 female artists record his songs in tribute.<ref name="Howl" /> According to Kelly, he adapted his song "Foggy Highway" for Renée Geyer because "I admired her deep soul singing, ferocious and vulnerable ... When I heard the finished version ... the hairs rose up on the back of my neck."<ref name="KellyGravy94"/> Kelly and The Stormwater Boys recorded it in a [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] style as the title track for the 2005 album ''Foggy Highway''.<ref name="KellyGravy166"/> [[Divinyls]]' lead singer [[Christina Amphlett]] recorded "Before Too Long"—she was attracted by the lyrics—she interpreted the song's narrator as being a stalker, and provided a female perspective in a darkly menacing manner à-la ''[[Fatal Attraction]]''.<ref name="Webb" />

Kelly has written songs with and for numerous artists, including [[Mick Thomas]], Geyer, [[Kate Ceberano]], Vika and Linda Bull, [[Nick Cave]], [[Nick Barker]], Kasey Chambers, Yothu Yindi, Archie Roach, [[Gyan Evans|Gyan]], [[Monique Brumby]], [[Kelly Willis]], Missy Higgins, and Troy Cassar-Daley.<ref name="apra02" /> He has described how some songs he writes are suited to other vocal ranges. "Quite often, I'm trying to write a certain kind of song and it's more ambitious than what my voice will get to. That's how I started writing songs with other people in mind".<ref name="Hillman"/> Kelly and Carmody's "From Little Things Big Things Grow" was analysed by Sydney University's Linguistics professor James R Martin. "[They] render the story as a narrative ... with the familiar Orientation, Complication, Evaluation, Resolution and Coda staging". Martin finds that Kelly and Carmody made the point that when people exert their rights with support from friends, they may defeat those with prestige.<ref name="Martin"/>

Kelly understands that co-writing with other songwriters lends power to his songs. "You often write songs with collaborators that you would never write by yourself. It's a way of dragging a song out of you that you wouldn't have come up with".<ref name="apra02" /> One of his collaborators, Linda Bull, described Kelly's process: they would start with a simple chat. "We'd just chuck ideas around and he'd pick the best bits. He'd take all the bluntness and crudeness out of it and make it beautiful; that's his magic ... It's conversations that you have {{Sic|every|day}}".<ref name="Songline" /> Forster summarised his 2009 review of Kelly's compilation, ''Songs from the South'', with "[his songs] sound easy and approachable ... Then you think: If the songs are so simple and the ideas behind them so clear, why aren't more people writing like Paul Kelly and sounding as good as he does?"<ref name="Forster" /> In 2010 Carmody and Kelly's "From Little Things Big Things Grow" was added to the [[National Film and Sound Archive]]'s Sounds of Australia Registry.<ref name="SoundsReg"/>

==Personal life==

Paul Kelly's first marriage (1980–84) was to Hilary Brown; the couple had a son, Declan, who later worked as a radio presenter on [[3RRR]]'s ''Against the Arctic'' from 2006.<ref name="Lure"/><ref name="Songline"/> As of 2007, he was a DJ around Melbourne and played the drums.<ref name="Hargreaves"/> For ''Paul Kelly: Stories of Me'', Declan recalled his feelings whenever he hears "When I First Met Your Ma", which describes Kelly's courtship of Hilary Brown.<ref name="Street 2013"/> Hilary Brown remembered "songs written especially for and about her" but also about other women, she quipped "There are too many girls out there! One for every song!"<ref name="Street 2013"/>

Kelly's second marriage (1993–2001) was to actress [[Kaarin Fairfax]].<ref name="Mordue1996"/> ''The Monthly''{{'}}s Richard Guilliatt travelled with Kelly, his band and "his new love and future wife, the diminutive" Fairfax on a section of the group's US tour prior to the release of ''Under the Sun''.<ref name="Guilliatt"/> The couple have two daughters, Madeleine (born 1991) and Memphis (born 1993).<ref name="Lure"/> From 1989 to 1992, Fairfax supplied backing vocals on tracks by Paul Kelly and the Messengers. In 1990, as Mary-Jo Starr, a country music artist, Fairfax released three singles, and an album, ''Too Many Movies''. Memphis Kelly starred alongside her parents in the [[Rachel Perkins]] short film, ''[[One Night the Moon]]'' (2001), for which Paul Kelly composed the score.<ref name="Lure"/><ref name="TrovePK"/> 

After the couple separated in 2001, Madeleine and Memphis stayed with Fairfax, but Kelly maintained contact with his daughters.<ref name="Songline"/> In 2010 Madeleine and Memphis formed a pop indie trio, Wishful, with Sam Humphrey; they were later joined by Harley Hamer and Caleb Williams. In March 2014, Wishful performed at the [[Port Fairy Folk Festival]].<ref name="Wishful"/>

Kelly was in a relationship with Sian Prior, a journalist, university lecturer and opera singer, from 2002-11.<ref name="Songline"/><ref name="UniMelb"/> They met when Kelly was interviewed on her ''Sunday Arts'' ABC radio program.<ref name="Songline"/> Kelly wrote "You're 39, You're Beautiful and You're Mine" for Prior who was already 40 by the time he finished.<ref name="Songline"/> Prior has played clarinet and provided backing vocals on some of Kelly's songs, as well as with the Stardust Five.<ref name="Harbour"/> She has performed live with Kelly on several occasions including clarinet on six tracks of his ''A – Z Recordings'' boxed set.<ref name="Stands"/><ref name="Quarry"/><ref name="Shedden"/>

In his memoir, Kelly credited Prior with inspiring him to give up his long-term heroin addiction, "I got lucky, I met a woman who said: 'It's me or it'. She gave me the number of a counsellor ... I thought about 'it' every day for a long time. Less now".<ref name="KellyGravy79"/> The couple had separated during the making of Kelly's biopic, however the separation is not mentioned and Prior is not interviewed in the film.<ref name="Strickland"/><ref name="Street 2013"/> According to Prior after a date in 2011, "[we] came home. He sat on the bed. 'I've decided I want to be single again,' he told her. 'Yes, I have been with other women.'"<ref name="Wood"/> The split occurred after she had filmed her interview and "after the breakup, [she] requested the footage not be used. Her presence in Kelly's life is as a footnote in the credits. It's as if she was never there."<ref name="Wood"/>

Siân Darling became Kelly's partner. They met in 2014 performing in a theatre show called 'Funeral'. The couple continue to live and work together from their St Kilda base. Darling is an artist, activist, curator and producer, and has been working on Kelly's professional management team since 2018. Her influence on Kelly's work is noted in the Stuart Coupe biography. Darling is the subject of several songs and has produced and directed some of Kelly's music videos: "With the One I Love", "Sleep Australia Sleep", and "When We're Both Old and Mad". Darling produced the album 'Cannot Buy My Soul' (2020 edition) picking up the torch that Kelly first lit in 2007.{{cn|date=October 2021}}
