'''M.Y.M.P.''' (or '''MYMP''', short for '''Make Your Momma Proud''') is an [[acoustic music|acoustic]] band from Quezon City, [[Philippines]]. They released their first album, ''[[Soulful Acoustic]],'' in 2003 and a double album, ''[[Beyond Acoustic]]'' and ''[[Versions (MYMP album)|Versions]]'' in 2004.

==Background==

===Origin (1995–2002)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Jacques "Chin" Alcantara founded Make Your Momma Proud in late 1995, named in tribute to his deceased mother.{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

In 2003, Alcantara recruited [[Juris Fernandez]] and her then-boyfriend Mike Manahan to MYMP.{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

===Early career (2003–2004)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Kazu Watanabe produced their debut album, ''[[Soulful Acoustic]]  under'' Ivory Music and Video. The band's original song "A Little Bit", a composition of Raymund Ryan Santes, won the People's Choice "Favorite Song"  [[Awit Award]] in 2004. Manahan left the band in 2003 due to “professional differences” as well as fallout from Manahan's breakup with Fernandez.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===''Versions and'' ''Beyond, Now'' (2005–2008)===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
Juris and Chin toured as a duo to promote Soulful Acoustic. They then recorded their double-disc 2nd album, [[Beyond Acoustic]] and [[Versions (MYMP album)|Versions]].{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

On October 1, 2005, MYMP had their first concert at the Music Museum, titled 'Especially For You'. The success of the concert prompted the band to hold its first major concert at the Araneta Coliseum on November 18, 2005, and a repeat on February 3, 2006. MYMP later released [[New Horizon (MYMP album)]]. MYMP embarked on a US summer tour in 2006 and 2007.{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

In 2008, MYMP ended their contract with Ivory Music and signed a deal with [[Star Music]], releasing their last album with Ivory Music, ''[[Now (MYMP album)|Now]]''.{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

===Departure of Juris Fernandez, new label and lineup changes===
On November 5, 2009, [[Juris Fernandez]] was expelled from MYMP due to "irreconcilable professional differences".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lo|first=Ricky|title=M.Y.M.P. breaks up!|url=https://www.philstar.com/entertainment/2009/10/31/518781/mymp-breaks-up|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Philstar.com}}</ref> Contract disputes froze Chin and MYMP for 2 years, preventing them from recording outside Star Records, which was Juris' label. She was replaced by Carmela Ravanilla.

In 2018, Carmella Ravanilla joined the band as a lead vocalist. 2018 also marked the year when MYMP returned to its original label, Ivory Music and Video. They released original song "Wishes & Dreams" after almost 6 years of not recording new material.{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

In July 2020, they released "Blue Kiss". Their latest release is a Christmas single "Last Christmas" in October 2020.{{Cn|date=October 2021}}

===Blackface controversy===
On October 30, 2020, MYMP went live on Facebook for a Halloween show with Chin Alcantara wearing [[blackface]]. In the session, the group stated that the Black Lives Matter movement was not to be supported and was propaganda,<ref>{{Cite web|title=MYMP wears blackface as Halloween costume, says Black Lives Matter is propaganda|url=http://www.wazzuppilipinas.com/2020/10/mymp-wears-blackface-as-halloween.html|access-date=2020-10-31}}</ref> saying "All Lives Matter".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-10-31|title=MYMP in hot water over blackface performance|url=https://mb.com.ph/2020/10/31/mymp-in-hot-water-over-blackface-performance/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Manila Bulletin|language=en-US}}</ref> This was met with tremendous backlash with over 11,000 comments on the live, with the majority denouncing MYMP's use of race as a costume.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Balleras|first=Care|date=2020-10-30|title=MYMP slammed for blackface Halloween costume|url=https://tribune.net.ph/index.php/2020/10/31/mymp-slammed-for-blackface-halloween-costume/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Daily Tribune|language=en-US}}</ref>
