This includes the long running ''[[Back to Mine]]'' sessions as well as ''[[NME in Association with War Child Presents 1 Love]]'', ''The Bedroom Sessions'' and more recently the ''[[Faithless – Renaissance 3D|Renaissance 3D]]'' music project, in conjunction with the [[Renaissance (club)|Renaissance]] nightclub.

On 29 September 2006, the first single "[[Bombs (single)|Bombs]]" from their album ''[[To All New Arrivals]]'' made its debut on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Pete Tong]] show. The album was released on 27 November 2006. "Bombs" generated moderate controversy with its music video, as demonstrated by [[MTV]]'s refusal to air it.<ref name=shots>{{cite web |url=http://www.shots.net/article_detail.asp?atype=1&id=3368 |title=Bombs Away |publisher=Shots.net |access-date=28 November 2006 |date=1 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413160547/http://www.shots.net/article_detail.asp?atype=1 |archive-date=13 April 2010 }}</ref> The video featured interchanged clips of war scenes and daily life.

===Sixth studio album and retirement announcement===
On 7 August 2009, a dub mix of the track "Sun to Me" from their latest studio album, ''[[The Dance (Faithless album)|The Dance]]'', made its debut on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s [[Pete Tong]] show. "Sun to Me" has been given as a free download to all users that have registered on the new Faithless site, or subscribed to their newsletter. The track has been released on the band's [[Myspace]] page as well. On 12 February 2010, the first official single from the next Faithless album was played on Pete Tong's show. The single, "Not Going Home", was released on 4 May 2010, whilst the latest album ''[[The Dance (Faithless album)|The Dance]]'', was issued on 16 May 2010. The album was available only in [[Tesco]] (three-month exclusive contract) and via [[iTunes]] in the UK. Since 2009, their track "Drifting Away" has been the [[theme tune]] for the [[BBC Television]]'s Chelsea Flower Show coverage.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/chelsea|title=BBC Two – RHS Chelsea Flower Show|publisher=BBC|access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, they returned to the [[Glastonbury Festival]] after eight years, playing on the Pyramid Stage. They performed many of their most popular songs including "Insomnia", "God is a DJ", and "We Come 1".

On 16 March 2011, Maxi Jazz announced on his website that Faithless would cease to be, commenting "But, like when writing a song, you always just ''know'' when it's finished… this is and was the ''Thank YOU And Goodbye'' tour."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2011-03-17|title=Faithless split up|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/faithless-split-up-2244592.html|access-date=2020-09-03|website=The Independent|language=en}}</ref>

They played two nights at [[Brixton Academy]] on 7 and 8 April 2011. The latter date would allegedly be the final full Faithless touring band show and was transmitted live via satellite to cinemas across Europe. Upon the completion of the two shows, live versions of Faithless's songs were compiled into an album titled ''Passing the Baton – Live from Brixton''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Faithless-Passing-The-Baton-Live-From-Brixton/release/3493431|title=Faithless – Passing The Baton – Live From Brixton|publisher=discogs|access-date=19 April 2018}}</ref>

===Early and mid-2010s===
The Faithless 'Sound System' (consisting of Maxi Jazz, Sister Bliss and percussionist [[Sudha Kheterpal]]) performed shows on 22 July 2011 at the [[Tomorrowland (festival)|Tomorrowland festival]] in Belgium, at the Waterford Music Fest in Ireland on 30 July<ref>{{Cite web|title=Waterford Music Fest 2011|url=https://www.ticketmaster.ie/promo/nmews2|access-date=2020-09-03|website=www.ticketmaster.ie}}</ref> and in [[Split, Croatia|Split (Croatia)]] at the Riva Discothèque on 12 August.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faithless.co.uk/gig_details.php?id=133 |title=New Album Out Now |publisher=Faithless |access-date=15 September 2011}}</ref>

A series of DJ sets of house tracks played by Bliss, with Jazz performing vocals to a selection of Faithless tracks, were performed in the mid 2010s. Full band performances including festivals and headline arena shows took place in 2015 under the 'Faithless 2.0' banner, in support of their compilation album of the same name released that year. The album also featured a new studio track entitled "I Was There''"''. In an interview given by the trio in August 2015, it was communicated that Sister Bliss and Rollo already had new tracks and collaborations waiting for Maxi Jazz’s decision on the return.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.standard.co.uk/go/london/music/faithless-on-reuniting-and-a-remix-album-a2918486.html |author=Evening Standard |title=Faithless: On reuniting and a remix album |date=21 August 2015 |access-date=9 November 2020}}</ref>

As of 2017, DJ sets have featured Bliss only, with her performing under both the ''Faithless'' and ''Faithless DJ Set'' banners.

=== Duo return with 7th album All Blessed ===
On 5 June 2020, Faithless released two edits of a new song, "Let the Music Decide."<ref>{{cite web|title=F A I T H L E S S -- LET THE MUSIC DECIDE|url=https://faithless.co.uk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200605175402/https://faithless.co.uk/|archive-date=5 June 2020}}</ref> which featured the vocals of [[George the Poet]] and was only available for a limited time on music streaming platforms.

16 July 2020 saw the group follow up with another single, "This Feeling". Similar to "Let The Music Decide", this track also features a spoken poet [[Suli Breaks]] with additional vocals by singer/songwriter Nathan Ball.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.faithless.co.uk/|title=FAITHLESS — ALL BLESSED|website=Faithless.co.uk|access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> Another single with Nathan Ball on vocals, "Synthesizer", was released on 28 August 2020 alongside its music video, with an announcement for the release date of 23 October for Faithless's next album, ''[[All Blessed]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Faithless return with first album in a decade, unveil lead single, 'Synthesizer'|website=[[Dancing Astronaut]]|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2020/09/faithless-return-first-album-decade-unveil-new-single-synthesizer/|last=Mao|first=Jessica|date=September 2, 2020|access-date=September 3, 2020}}</ref> Maxi Jazz does not perform on the album, and is thanked in the sleeve notes for "passing the baton". The absence of Jazz has been described as giving the music "a very different feel vocally".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.magneticmag.com/2020/10/album-review-faithless-all-blessed/|title=Album Review: Faithless - All Blessed|first=Ryan|last=Middleton|website=Magneticmag.com|access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref>

As well as their own studio albums, all three members actively engage in other people's work as solo figures. Sister Bliss is a prominent dance DJ and has for a long time toured the circuit on her own, remixed others' albums and even appeared in music videos, such as [[Paul Oakenfold]]'s "Weekend". Maxi Jazz brought out an album before the formation of Faithless and also worked on pirate radio. He also collaborated with Faithless founding member [[Jamie Catto]] on his new project ''[[1 Giant Leap]]'' guesting on a song with [[Robbie Williams]]. Finally, Rollo founded the label [[Cheeky Records]] and has produced the music of other artists, most notably his sister [[Dido (singer)|Dido's]] albums, as well as using various monikers to create popular dance music under the names Rollo Goes ... (Camping, Mystic and Spiritual), [[Felix (musician)|Felix]], Our Tribe (with [[Rob Dougan]]), and [[Dusted (British band)|Dusted]].
