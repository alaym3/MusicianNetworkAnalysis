==History==

===''Alexisonfire'' (2001–2003)===
{{main|Alexisonfire (album)}}

Alexisonfire was formed in late 2001 in the aftermath of a three-band break up. Pettit was playing guitar in a metal band called Condemning Salem, Green was lead singer and guitar player in Helicon Blue,<ref>{{cite web |title=Helicon Blue |url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/4430591-Helicon-Blue |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> and MacNeil and Steele played in a punk band called Plan 9. These bands broke up at the same time, and Pettit, Steele, MacNeil and Green recruited drummer Jesse Ingelevics, and formed Alexisonfire.<ref name=musicianguide>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004551/Alexisonfire.html |title=Alexisonfire lyrics, music, biography, records, band, album, videos, CD, and the discography including Alexisonfire famous works |publisher=Musicianguide.com |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref> The band's name was derived from [[Alexis Fire]],<ref name=musicianguide/> the world's only lactating contortionist stripper.<ref name=AOFmyspace>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/alexisonfire |title=Alexisonfire – St. Catharines, CA – Hardcore / Rock / Indie – myspace.com/alexisonfire |publisher=MySpace.com |access-date=February 20, 2011}}</ref> When Fire discovered that they were using her website name as their band name, she threatened to sue, but it was discovered that the moniker was not registered, and no further action took place.<ref name=musicianguide/> 

In 2002, the band released its first EP, ''Math Sheets Demo'', so named because the [[Compact Disc|CD]] was wrapped in [[Jesse Ingelevics]]' math homework.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alexisonfire – Math Sheets Demo |url=https://www.discogs.com/master/643146-Alexisonfire-Math-Sheets-Demo |website=discogs.com |publisher=Discogs |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleck |first1=Scott |title=Punk TV: Alexisonfire Interview... |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216000433/http://www.punktv.ca/?c=105&a=1439 |website=web.archive.org |publisher=Punk TV |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> This caught the attention of [[recording engineer]] [[Greg Below]] and [[Montreal]] journalist [[Mitch Joel]], who were setting up the record label [[Distort Entertainment]] and were looking for artists.

On October 31, 2002, ''[[Alexisonfire (album)|Alexisonfire]]'' was released, the cover art featuring two Catholic school girls engaged in a knife fight,<ref name=musicianguide/> which was the band's description of their music. Although there was a distribution deal with EMI, the album's success was mostly attributed to [[word-of-mouth]].

Alexisonfire recorded their second album with [[Julius Butty]] at his Silo Studios near [[Hamilton, Ontario]],<ref name=musicianguide/>  ''[[Watch Out!

As soon as the album was released, the band went on tour, playing the Vans [[Warped Tour]] on several US dates, and then heading to the UK, playing the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] and other British gigs. (While playing [[Glasgow]] with [[Johnny Truant]] and The Blood Roses in, the members of all three bands had the word "Yeti" tattooed on themselves. On an episode of the MuchMusic program ''The New Music'', Pettit and Green said that the idea for the tattoos came from the 1988 [[Gary Oldman]] film ''[[The Firm (1988 film)|The Firm]]''.) The band spent all of 2005 on the road, touring the UK, US, Canada and Europe. They also played the [[Summer Sonic Festival]] in Japan.<ref>{{cite web |title=Alexisonfire's Concert History |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/alexisonfire?page=15#concert-table |website=concertarchives.org |publisher=Concert Archives |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref>

At this time, Pettit told a reporter: "The next record, I think, is us pretty much wanting to put the knife in screamo.

===Break-up and Farewell Tour (2011–2012)===
[[File:Alexisonfire Live 2012 In Vancouver.JPG|thumb|Alexisonfire performing in Vancouver on their 2012 farewell tour.]]
In 2005, Dallas Green had launched a solo folk/rock side project called [[City and Colour]]. The project had become very successful and between that and his commitments to Alexisonfire, he said that he suffered a nervous breakdown and that being in Alexisonfire was killing him.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Goodwyn |first1=Tom |title=Dallas Green: ‘Being in Alexisonfire was killing me’, Aug 2011 |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/alexisonfire-9-1273780 |website=nme.com |publisher=NME |access-date=28 November 2021}}</ref> At the end of the ''Old Crows/Young Cardinals'' tour, Green told the band that he was leaving Alexisonfire, but that he would not announce his departure until the rest of the band decided on their future plans.<ref name="spinner-Greeninterview2011">{{cite web| last = Ladouceur| first = Liisa| title = Dallas Green Says Alexisonfire Was 'Killing' Him, Is Fine Being 'The Villain' After Split| work = [[Spinner (website)|Spinner]]| publisher = [[AOL]]| date = August 8, 2011| url = http://www.spinner.com/2011/08/08/dallas-green-alexisonfire-split/| access-date = August 10, 2011}}</ref>

On February 14, 2011, Alexisonfire tweeted that they had been writing new music for their fifth studio album, describing it as "so heavy it's going to make ''Dog's Blood'' look like a ska record".<ref>{{cite web|title=I Read The News Today...

In the statement, George Pettit cited the departures of both Green and MacNeil (who left to become the vocalist for [[Gallows (band)|Gallows]]), and personal issues among the remaining members as reasons for breaking up. Pettit also described the break-up as not being "amicable".<ref>{{cite web| last = Zaleski| first = Annie| title = Alexisonfire break up| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = August 5, 2011| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/alexisonfire_break_up| access-date = August 5, 2011}}</ref> Alexisonfire planned on celebrating their tenth anniversary with one last headlining Canadian tour and "a series of releases",<ref>{{cite web|title=Alexisonfire 2001–2011 |work=[[Kerrang!]] |date=August 5, 2011 |url=http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2011/08/alexisonfire_2001-2011.html |access-date=August 5, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017065340/http://www.kerrang.com/blog/2011/08/alexisonfire_2001-2011.html |archive-date=October 17, 2012 }}</ref> although Green had specifically said that, for him, their Dec 19, 2010 show in their hometown was their last concert.<ref name="spinner-Greeninterview2011" />
