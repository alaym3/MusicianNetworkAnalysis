== History ==
=== Established in Greymouth===
[[Tai Poutini Polytechnic]] in [[Greymouth]] first offered a Certificate in Contemporary Music programme when the institute was established in 1990.<ref name="vle.tpp.ac.nz">{{Cite web|url=https://vle.tpp.ac.nz/course/view.php?id=617&section=3|title=Course: Orientation (2), Topic: About|website=vle.tpp.ac.nz|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> In 1992 the Certificate in Audio Engineering and Music Production was introduced, and a purpose-built sound and recording studio was constructed at the Greymouth campus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/20974308|title=Deep south|last=Conmee|first=Graham|date=1992-08-01|website=New Zealand musician, Aug 1992; v.3 n.7:p.20; issn|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> This programme was followed by a Certificate in Live Sound and Event Production which commenced in 1994.That same year (1994) a Certificate in Audio Engineering was offered in [[Auckland]] and temporary premises were leased in [[Queen Street, Auckland|Queen Street.]]The Diploma of Audio Engineering and Music Production was added at the Auckland Campus at 11-13 Waverley street in 1995, using [[York Street Studio]] 'A' in [[Parnell, New Zealand|Parnell]] for studio practicals. In 1996 Certificates in Contemporary Music and Live Sound and Event Production were offered in Auckland, originally using Waverley Street for theory and what is now the [https://basementtheatre.co.nz/store?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpd2SvJGT5QIVhpOPCh2mGQldEAAYASAAEgIyv_D_BwE Basement Theatre] for practicals. From 1996 the Certificate and Diploma in Audio Engineering and Music Production ran on the seventh floor of the LJ Hooker building (formerly [[AETNA house]]) on [[Newton, New Zealand|Symonds Street]], Auckland,.<ref name="vle.tpp.ac.nz"/>

Live Sound ''( Special Event)'' and Contemporary Music programmes moved to the [[Manukau Institute of Technology]] Campus in 1997.<ref name="vle.tpp.ac.nz"/>

For a number of years the Certificate in Audio Engineering and Certificate in Contemporary Music were offered at Auckland and Greymouth campuses simultaneously.

=== Established in Christchurch and Auckland ===
In 1998, the entire suite of Music and Audio programmes was relocated to Auckland.  

In 2001 all the teaching was consolidated on the current premises, Rainger House, at 150 Victoria Street West, Auckland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/items?i%5Bdisplay_collection%5D=findNZarticles&i%5Bsubject_text%5D=Music+and+Audio+Institute+of+New+Zealand|title=Page 1 of 1 {{!}} Items {{!}} National Library of New Zealand|website=natlib.govt.nz|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> The new Auckland campus was opened by Prime Minister [[Helen Clark]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://natlib.govt.nz/records/30842534|title=Music Institute open on a high note|last=Pahi|first=Mary|date=11 May 2001|website=National Library|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref> During 2001, audio engineering programmes were offered for the first time in Christchurch.

A suitable building at 191 [[High Street]] in the Christchurch CBD was leased and outfitted ready for  the start  of 2002. Initially  the Certificate in Audio  Engineering Level 5 was offered, and the Diploma of Audio Engineering Level 6 was added in 2003. The MAINZ Certificate in Live Sound and Event Production Level 4 was offered from 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/features/education-guide/tertiary/music-and-audio-institute-new-zealand-amplify-your-future|title=Music and Audio Institute of New Zealand - Amplify your future|date=2019-06-05|website=Otago Daily Times Online News|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/|title=Certificate in live sound and event production|date=2004-02-29|access-date=2019-10-11|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref>

=== Established Degree Level Provision ===
With interest for degree level provision developing MAINZ started offering the [[Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology|CPIT]] Bachelor of Musical Arts in 2014. In 2015 [[Tai Poutini Polytechnic]] gained approval to offer their own Bachelor of Musical Arts and the first graduates were awarded their degrees in the March 2017 graduation.

The Graduate Diploma in Business and Enterprise was also introduced in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzmusician.co.nz/directories/mainz-the-music-and-audio-institute-of-new-zealand/|title=MAINZ (Music And Audio Institute Of New Zealand)|website=NZ Musician|language=en|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>

MAINZ offered a Bachelor of Audio Engineering and Production and a new Graduate Diploma in Audio Engineering and Production in 2016 and had its first graduates receiving their degree in the ceremony of 2017.

=== Transfer to Southern Institute of Technology ===

On 31 January 2018 the MAINZ faculty transferred from [[Tai Poutini Polytechnic]] to Southern Institute of Technology, as [[Tai Poutini Polytechnic]] had run into difficulties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://educationcentral.co.nz/polytech-mega-merger-the-benefits-risks-and-challenges/|title=Polytech mega-merger: the benefits, risks and challenges|date=8 August 2019|website=Education Central|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sit.ac.nz/Home/About-Us/News/Articles/ID/376/MAINZ-to-Transfer-to-Southern-Institute-of-Technology|title=MAINZ TO TRANSFER TO SOUTHERN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY|last=Hourston|first=Mequa|date=13 December 2017|website=Southern Institute of Technology}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nzmusician.co.nz/news/mainz-transfer-sit/|title=MAINZ to sit under SIT|website=NZ Musician|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/education/101908959/what-went-wrong-at-tai-poutini-polytech--new-zealands-worst-polytechnic|title=What went wrong at Tai Poutini Polytech - New Zealand's worst polytechnic|last=Joanne|first=Carroll|date=10 March 2018|website=Stuff|access-date=11 October 2019}}</ref>
