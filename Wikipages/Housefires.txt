'''Housefires''' are an American [[contemporary worship music|worship]] band from [[Atlanta]], Georgia. Forming in 2014, they have released five [[live albums]].

==Background==
Housefires originated at Grace Midtown Church in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. The church had released two prior worship albums as Grace Midtown, with Pat Barrett and others leading.  Housefires formed in 2014, with the addition of Kirby Kaple as a worship pastor at Grace, and signaled a shift in the church's musical style toward a more stripped-down style reminiscent of artists such as [[United Pursuit]] and [[All Sons & Daughters]]. Barrett and Kaple were joined by fellow Atlanta worship leader Tony Brown, and Grace Athens worship pastor Nate Moore. Additional members included violinist Vicki Schmidt, keyboardist Jonathan Jay, percussionist, Zac Brooks, and drummer Harold Brown.<ref name="CCM Review">{{cite web|first=Matt |last=Conner |url=http://www.ccmmagazine.com/reviews/housefires-iii-album-review/ |title=Housefires – ‘iii’ album review |journal=[[CCM Magazine]] |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |date=August 15, 2016}}</ref><ref name="TCB Review">{{cite web|first=Madeleine |last=Dittmer |url=http://www.thechristianbeat.org/index.php/exclusives/2441-housefires-shares-passion-with-moving-music-and-powerful-lyrics-in-housefires-iii |title=Housefires Shares Passion With Moving Music And Powerful Lyrics In "Housefires III" |publisher=The Christian Beat |accessdate=August 19, 2016 |date=August 2, 2016}}</ref>  In 2016, the band also participated in the Outcry Tour, and continued touring independently in 2017.
