'''The Radio Dept.''' is a Swedish [[dream pop]] band from [[Lund]].

==History==
In 1995, schoolmates Elin Almered and Johan Duncanson started a band which they named after a gas-station-turned-radio-repair-shop called "Radioavdelningen" ([[Swedish language|Swedish]] for The Radio Department). However, Almered and Duncanson soon stopped playing music together, putting the outfit on hiatus. Three years later, in 1998, Duncanson started making music again but now with Martin Larsson and they decided to adopt the same name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magicrpm.com/videos/interview/the-radio-dept/entrevue-26-05-2010-premier-episode |title=The Radio Dept. |language=fr |publisher=Magicrpm |date=2014-07-31 |access-date=2014-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811055230/http://www.magicrpm.com/videos/interview/the-radio-dept/entrevue-26-05-2010-premier-episode |archive-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2001, Larsson's then girlfriend Lisa Carlberg joined the group on bass, followed by Per Blomgren on drums and Daniel Tjäder on keyboards.<ref>

Later in 2001, the Radio Dept. sent recordings to music magazine ''Sonic'', receiving a positive review and being featured on the free CD sampler that came with the magazine. [[Labrador Records]] heard them on the disc and signed them to their label. The band's debut album ''[[Lesser Matters]]'' (2003) was well received by the music press, scoring 10 out of 10 in the ''[[NME]]''. Per Blomgren left the Radio Dept. prior to the release of this album and Lisa Carlberg departed after the release of ''This Past Week EP''. According to their website, the band decided to use digital drum tracks and stated that for their second album they were "taking a new direction ... which wouldn't require a member that played bass guitar."<ref name="sitebio">{{cite web|url = http://www.theradiodept.frih.net/Band.htm|title = The Radio Dept.

The group enjoyed a slightly more widespread recognition after three tracks ("Pulling Our Weight", "I Don't Like It Like This" and "Keen on Boys") were included on the soundtrack for [[Sofia Coppola]]'s film ''[[Marie Antoinette (2006 film)|Marie Antoinette]]''.

Early 2006 saw the release of their second album, ''[[Pet Grief]]''. The distorted buzz that adorned most of their debut was now replaced by synthesizer.  The album didn't reach the rest of Europe, including the UK until later in 2006. With little touring support, there was no real buzz behind ''Pet Grief''. Reviews were mixed. ''NME'' rated the album with a 7 out of 10, but other magazines were less positive. However, it did find popularity amongst a growing fan base throughout the world, thanks to the internet. The album is available in the US through [[Darla Records|Darla]] and through their US distribution deal with Labrador.

At the end of 2006, a new track, "We Made the Team", was released as the 100th release on the Labrador. It was also the final track on the Labrador's labels Compilation of 100 tracks released at the beginning of 2007.

The band released a new EP in May 2008 entitled ''Freddie And The Trojan Horse'' on Labrador Records. Another EP, ''David'', was released on June 24, 2009. The song "David" was also made available for download at no cost by Labrador Records. The band released their third album, ''[[Clinging to a Scheme]]'', on April 20, 2010.

In January 2011, their first compilation album, ''[[Passive Aggressive: Singles 2002–2010]]'', was released. It contained all the A-sides released by the band and many of the B-sides and other rarities. That year they were nominated at the Swedish [[Grammis]] in the categories “Album of the Year” and “Band of the Year”.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Radio Dept. announce 2011 tour dates|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/12/the-radio-dept-announce-2011-tour-dates/|publisher=Consequence of Sound|access-date=7 July 2013|date=22 December 2010}}</ref> In 2011, the band began a tour in the United States and Mexico; in 2012 they visited Latin America,<ref>[http://ww.automatic.com.pe/espanol/liveacts/live_acts_detalle020712.htm] {{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> and in 2013 they toured in Turkey and other countries of Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/labradorrecords/posts/10151386109751592 |title=The Radio Dept on tour in Asia at the... - Labrador Records |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2014-08-06}}</ref>
