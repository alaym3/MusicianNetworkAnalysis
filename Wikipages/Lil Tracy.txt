Butler started to make music when he was 15<ref name="massappealtracy" /> before moving to Los Angeles, California at 18 (without alerting his parents) to focus more on his music career and due to being [[homeless]].<ref name=":0" /> Butler originally started rapping under the name "Yung Bruh", releasing several mixtapes under the [[Thraxxhouse]] collective.
