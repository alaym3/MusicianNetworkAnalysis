'''Belly''' are an [[alternative rock]] band formed in Rhode Island in 1991 by former [[Throwing Muses]] and [[The Breeders|Breeders]] member [[Tanya Donelly]]. The original lineup consisted of Donelly on vocals and guitar, Fred Abong on [[Bass guitar|bass]], and brothers Tom and Chris Gorman on guitar and drums respectively.<ref name="NME">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nme.com/news/belly/91351|title=Belly announce reunion 20 years after '90s split|last=Britton|first=Luke Morgan|date=February 9, 2016|magazine=[[NME]]|access-date=February 9, 2016}}</ref>  The band released two albums during the early 1990s [[alternative rock]] boom before breaking up in 1995. They reunited in 2016 and mounted limited tours in the United States and United Kingdom that year. 

All four original members knew each other from high-school on [[Aquidneck Island]], [[Rhode Island]] &ndash; the Gormans and Abong coming out of the [[Newport, Rhode Island|Newport]] hardcore scene (the Gormans having played in Verbal Assault, Abong in Vicious Circle).  Donelly had previously co-founded two Boston-based [[indie rock]] bands, [[Throwing Muses]] and [[The Breeders]], the former with her step-sister [[Kristin Hersh]] and the latter with [[Kim Deal]] of the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]]. In 1993, their debut album ''[[Star (Belly album)|Star]]'' was released, and its lead single "[[Feed the Tree]]" would be Belly's biggest hit song, peaking at number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and number 95 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].  Several additional singles from the album also appeared on the Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Shortly after the release of ''Star'', Abong left the group and was replaced by [[Gail Greenwood]]. The band released their second album, ''[[King (Belly album)|King]]'', in early 1995 and broke up at the end of that year, and Donelly embarked on a long solo career.  She reformed Belly in 2016 with the same lineup that had recorded ''King'', and their third album, ''[[Dove (Belly album)|Dove]]'', was released in 2018.

==History==
===1992–93: Formation and ''Star''===
Donelly named the band "Belly" because she thought the word was "both pretty and ugly."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.4ad.com/belly/profile/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060209050308/http://www.4ad.com/belly/profile/|archive-date=2006-02-09|title=Belly|website=4AD|access-date=October 14, 2014}}</ref> The band played their first concert on March 14, 1992 at the 3's bar in their hometown of [[Newport, Rhode Island]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Belly official Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/bellytheband/photos/a.1278365948857149.1073741828.1245091442184600/1836314323062306/?type=3|website=Facebook|access-date=8 August 2017}}</ref>

The band's debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Slow Dust'' (1992), made it to number one on the United Kingdom [[UK Indie Chart|indie chart]]. Soon after, their single "[[Feed the Tree]]" made the [[Top 40]] in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and their first album, ''[[Star (Belly album)|Star]]'' (1993), hit number two on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In the United States, the album was [[RIAA]] certified [[music recording sales certification|gold]], largely based on the success of "Feed the Tree" on Modern Rock radio stations and [[MTV]], where the video was featured as part of MTV's [[Buzz Bin]] videos and [[Alternative Nation]] video show for much of 1993. Two follow-up singles were released, "Gepetto" and "Slow Dog," but neither matched the initial success of "Feed the Tree." Belly was nominated for two [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] in [[36th Annual Grammy Awards|1994]]: [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Performance]] for ''Star''. The album went on to sell over 800,000 copies in the US alone. On several early '93 tour dates in the US and the UK, former [[Throwing Muses]] member Leslie Langston lent a hand on bass.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belly Biography|url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Belly-Biography/7D19527DA83B7ABB48256A7F0027A863|access-date=Oct 26, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003170241/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Belly%2DBiography/7D19527DA83B7ABB48256A7F0027A863|archive-date=October 3, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> 
In early 1993, they embarked on a 'joint headliner' tour with [[Radiohead]]. Following a short warm up tour of smaller venues in the UK also in early 1993, they embarked upon a larger tour where they were supported by [[the Cranberries]].{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

===1994–96: ''King'' and break-up===
Just after the release of ''Star'', bassist Fred Abong left and was replaced by [[Gail Greenwood]]. Greenwood was originally a guitar player in a Boston-area metal band before being recruited to play bass in Belly. The live sound of the band evolved to accommodate her style, with its shows featuring more [[electric guitar]] than before and less of the dreamy quality of its first album.

As a result, the group's next album, ''[[King (Belly album)|King]]'' (1995), was more [[rock and roll]]-oriented. The album's sales did not meet label expectations, and its numerous singles fail to sustain any significant airplay on Modern Rock radio. Belly appeared on the April 20, 1995 cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. The band also performed "Super Connected" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in June that year. It was one of the band's last major U.S television appearances.<ref name = "RStone">{{cite web

  }}</ref> In  the summer of 1995, Belly was one of the support bands in Europe for [[R.E.M.]] on their world tour, then finished out the year extensively touring the US with [[Catherine Wheel (band)|Catherine Wheel]] and [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] as support acts.

In 1996, Donelly broke up the band. Speaking to ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', she explained the reasons behind her decision: "The first couple of years of Belly were a blast. ''Star'' was a big hit and we partied hard. But by the time we went to make ''King'', there was a lot of negative stuff going on. ''King'' was a reaction to the bright shininess of ''Star'' and we weren't surprised when it didn't sell. I regret not making another Belly album, but at the time I thought, Screw it, I'm outta here."<ref name="q">{{cite journal|last=Stubbs|first=Dan|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q Magazine]]|date=December 2007|title=Where Are They Now? – Belly|page=35}}</ref>

After the break-up Tanya Donelly started a successful solo career and has since released several solo albums.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Greenwood went on to stints playing bass for [[L7 (band)|L7]] and for [[Bif Naked]], while playing guitar in her own Rhode Island-based band Benny Sizzler. Tom Gorman played briefly with [[Buffalo Tom]], then on tour in 1999 with [[Kristin Hersh]] before joining up with his brother Chris in a commercial photography business based in New York City. Fred Abong first worked post-Belly as a carpenter "working in a high-end woodworking shop making fancy cabinets for rich people",<ref name="q"/> then went on to earn a PhD in philosophy.

===2016–present: Reunion and ''Dove''===
On February 8, 2016, the band launched an official web site announcing a limited summer reunion tour with dates in the UK, Ireland and the US.

In advance of the tour, the band performed two warm-up shows in their hometown of [[Newport, Rhode Island]] on July 8 and 9,<ref>{{cite web|last1=Marotta|first1=Michael|title=Super Connected: Belly to play first shows in 20 years this weekend in Newport|url=http://www.vanyaland.com/2016/07/06/super-connected-belly-play-first-shows-20-years-weekend-newport/|website=Vanyaland|access-date=6 July 2016|date=6 July 2016}}</ref> the band's first live appearances since 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sheley|first1=Matt|title=Together again: Rock band Belly set to tour 20 years after breakup|url=http://www.newportri.com/newportdailynews/news/page_one/together-again/article_abc2f553-d095-542c-85e4-c02234f756fa.html|website=[[The Newport Daily News]]|access-date=9 July 2016}}</ref> Two new songs, Human Child and Army of Clay were debuted on the tour that followed, hinting that the band was evolving, while at the same time maintaining familiar elements of the Belly 'sound' of the past.

Belly announced in July 2017 that they had begun recording a third album, to be titled ''[[Dove (Belly album)|Dove]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Belly Are Making Their First New Album in 22 Years|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/07/belly-band-new-album/|website=Spin|access-date=19 September 2017|date=11 July 2017}}</ref><ref name="pledgemusic.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/belly/updates/91815 |title=New Album: DOVE: ALBUM TITLE AT LAST!!|website=PledgeMusic.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref> On October 5, 2017, the band started a [[PledgeMusic]] campaign for the album, and the album was released on May 4, 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title= Belly Announce Crowdfunding Campaign For First New Album in 23 Years |url= https://www.stereogum.com/1965965/belly-announce-crowdfunding-campaign-for-first-new-album-in-23-years/news/ |website=Stereogum |access-date= 5 October 2017 |date=5 October 2017}}</ref> On October 26, 2017 the band released their cover of [http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/belly/updates/90241 Hushabye Mountain] as an exclusive download on Pledgemusic- their first new recording in over 20 years.
