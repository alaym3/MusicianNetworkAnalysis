'''Catherine Bush''' {{postnom|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 30 July 1958) is an English singer, songwriter, musician, dancer and record producer. In 1978, aged 19, she topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for four weeks with her debut single "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]", becoming the first female artist to achieve a UK number one with a self-written song.<ref name=":2" /> Bush has since released 25 UK [[Top 40]] singles, including the Top 10 hits "[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]", "[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]", "[[Running Up That Hill]]", "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]" (a duet with [[Peter Gabriel]]), and "[[King of the Mountain (Kate Bush song)|King of the Mountain]]". All 10 of her studio albums reached the UK Top 10, including the UK number one albums ''[[Never for Ever]]'' (1980), ''[[Hounds of Love]]'' (1985), and the compilation ''[[The Whole Story]]'' (1986). She was the first British solo female artist to top the UK album charts and the first female artist to enter the album chart at number one.<ref name="officialcharts.com" />

Bush began writing songs at 11. She was signed to [[EMI Records]] after [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]] helped produce a demo tape. Her debut album, ''[[The Kick Inside]]'', was released in 1978. Bush slowly gained artistic independence in album production and has produced all her studio albums since ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'' (1982). She took a hiatus between her seventh and eighth albums, ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'' (1993) and ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'' (2005). Bush drew attention again in 2014 with her concert residency [[Before the Dawn (Kate Bush concert residency)|Before the Dawn]], her first shows since 1979's [[The Tour of Life]].

Bush's [[Eclectic music|eclectic]] and [[Experimental music|experimental]] musical style, unconventional lyrics, and literary themes have influenced a diverse range of artists. She has been nominated for 13 [[British Phonographic Industry]] accolades,<ref name="brits" /> winning for [[Brit Award for British Female Solo Artist|Best British Female Artist]] in 1987,<ref>{{cite web |title=The BRITs 1987 |url=http://www.brits.co.uk/history/shows/1987 |website=[[Brit Awards]] |access-date=11 April 2015}}</ref> and has been nominated for three [[Grammy Award]]s. In 2002, Bush was recognised with an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Bush was appointed a CBE in the [[2013 New Year Honours]] for services to music.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-20860327 |title=BBC News – New Year Honours 2013: At a glance |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=29 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60367|date=29 December 2012|page=7 |supp=y}}</ref> She was nominated twice for induction in the 2018 and 2021 [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite press release |first=Lisa Respers |last=France |title=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 2018 nominees announced |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=5 October 2017 |access-date= 6 October 2017 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/10/05/entertainment/rock-hall-fame-2018-nominees/index.html}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockhall.com/nominees-announced-2021-induction|title=Nominees Announced for 2021 Induction &#124; Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|website=www.rockhall.com}}</ref>

== Life and career ==
===1958–1974: Early life===
Bush was born in [[Bexleyheath]], Kent,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tDYDAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20 |title=Under the Ivy |author=Graeme Thomson |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-78038-146-6}}</ref> to an English doctor, [[general practitioner]] Robert Bush (1920–2008), and Hannah (1918–1992), née Daly, an Irish staff nurse, daughter of a farmer in [[County Waterford]].<ref>Kate Bush and Hounds of Love, Ron Moy, Ashgate, 2007, p. 58</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/kate-bush-return-of-the-recluse-316516.html |title=Kate Bush: Return of the recluse |work=[[The Independent]] |author=Sweeting, Adam |date=2 October 2005}}</ref> She grew up in a former farmhouse in the London suburb of [[East Wickham]], [[Welling]], with her elder brothers, John and [[Paddy Bush|Paddy]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jovanovic |first1=Rob |title=Kate Bush: The biography |date=2015 |publisher=Little, Brown Book Group |location=Google Books |isbn=9780349411255 |page=Ch 2 |url=https://www.google.co.nz/books/edition/Kate_Bush/BVYNCgAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=Under+the+Ivy:+The+Life+%26+Music+of+Kate+Bush&printsec=frontcover}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/03/20/kate_bush/index.html |title=Kate Bush |work=Salon |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808064727/http://archive.salon.com/people/bc/2001/03/20/kate_bush/index.html |archive-date=8 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=East Wickham Farm |url=https://www.katebushencyclopedia.com/east-wickham-farm |website=Kate Bush Encyclopedia |access-date=19 November 2021}}</ref> Bush came from an artistic background: her mother was an amateur traditional Irish dancer, her father was an amateur pianist, Paddy worked as a musical instrument maker, and John was a poet and photographer. Both brothers were involved in the local [[folk music]] scene.<ref>{{citation |title=Haunting Kate Bush |work=[[NZ Listener]] |date=2 December 1978 |author=David Young}}</ref> She was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref name="Q magazine">{{cite news |url=http://www.paradiseplace.org.uk/Kate/Katep15.htm |title=Kate Bush @ Paradise Place – Q interview. |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=2 September 1999 |access-date=30 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209043555/http://www.paradiseplace.org.uk/Kate/Katep15.htm |archive-date=9 December 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Bush trained at [[Goldsmiths, University of London|Goldsmiths College]] [[karate]] club, where her brother John was a [[karate]] instructor. There, she became known as "Ee-ee" because of her squeaky [[kiai]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Born Fighter |last=Hazard |first=Dave |year=2007 |publisher=John Blake Publishing |location=London |isbn=978-1-84454-480-6 |page=114}}</ref>

Her family's musical influence inspired Bush to teach herself the piano at the age of 11. She also played the organ in a barn behind her parents' house and studied the violin.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p3805|pure_url=yes}} |title=Kate Bush Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> She soon began composing songs, eventually adding her own lyrics.<ref name="Rebel" />

===1975–1977: Career beginnings===
Bush attended St Joseph's Convent Grammar School, a Catholic girls' school in nearby [[Abbey Wood]] which, in 1975, after she had left, became part of St Mary's and St Joseph's School in [[Sidcup]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Pupils at former Abbey Wood school sought|url=http://www.newsshopper.co.uk/news/2448082.pupils_at_former_abbey_wood_school_sought/|website=News Shopper|publisher=Newsquest (London & Essex) Ltd|access-date=15 May 2018|date=18 September 2008}}</ref> During this time her family produced a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] with over 50 of her compositions, which was turned down by record labels. [[Pink Floyd]] guitarist [[David Gilmour]] received the demo from Ricky Hopper, a mutual friend of Gilmour and the Bush family. Impressed, Gilmour helped the 16 year-old Bush record a more professional demo tape.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/node/149907 |title=The Wow Factor |magazine=[[New Statesman]] |date=7 February 2005 |last=Cowley |first=Jason}}</ref> Three tracks in total were recorded and paid for by Gilmour.<ref>''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine, 8 February 1990, pp&nbsp;21–2: "The Sensual Woman" by Sheila Rogers.</ref> The tape was produced by Gilmour's friend [[Andrew Powell]], who went on to produce Bush's first two albums,<ref name="Rebel" /> and sound engineer [[Geoff Emerick]], who had worked with the Beatles.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Rightful Heir? |magazine=Q |number=48 |date=September 1990}}</ref> The tape was sent to [[EMI]] executive Terry Slater,<ref name="Soundscape" /> who signed her.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html |title=Kate Bush |publisher=[[EMI]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226142058/http://www.emi-premier.co.uk/loader.html |archive-date=26 February 2012}}</ref>

The British record industry was reaching a point of stagnation.<ref name="Soundscape" /> [[Progressive rock]] was very popular and visually oriented rock performers were growing in popularity, thus record labels looking for the next big thing were considering experimental acts.<ref name="Soundscape" /> Bush was put on [[Retainer agreement|retainer]] for two years by Bob Mercer, managing director of EMI group-repertoire division. According to Mercer, he felt Bush's material was good enough to release, but felt that if the album failed it would be demoralising and if it was successful Bush was too young to handle it.<ref name="Mercer" /> However, in a 1987 interview, Gilmour disputed this version of events, blaming EMI for initially using the "wrong" producers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-K3NPR4q5I&t=110| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/3-K3NPR4q5I| archive-date=2021-10-28|title=David Gilmour talks about discovering Kate Bush|last=ravenhearst09|date=7 April 2017|via=YouTube|access-date=16 October 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

After the contract signing, EMI gave her a large advance, which she used to enroll in [[interpretive dance]] classes taught by [[Lindsay Kemp]], a former teacher of [[David Bowie]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Today's Style And Looks|work=Face & Figure|year=1979}}</ref> and mime training with [[Adam Darius]].<ref>[[Adam Darius|Darius, A]].

She left school after doing her mock [[GCE Advanced Level|A-levels]] and having gained ten [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] [[O-Level]] qualifications.<ref name="MightyBush" />

Bush wrote and made demos of almost 200 songs, some of which circulated as [[Bootleg recording|bootlegs]].<ref>{{cite magazine |date=September 2001 |title=Kate Bush in MP3 |magazine=Q }}</ref> From March to August 1977, she fronted the KT Bush Band at public houses in London. The band included [[Del Palmer]] (bass), Brian Bath (guitar), and Vic King (drums). She began recording her first album in August 1977.<ref name="Rebel" />

===1978–1979: ''The Kick Inside'' and ''Lionheart''===

For her debut album, ''[[The Kick Inside]]'' (1978), Bush was persuaded to use established session musicians instead of the KT Bush Band. She retained some of these even after she had brought her bandmates back on board.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lyricsystem.com/kate-bush/ |title=Kate Bush Biography |publisher=LyricSystem.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012171005/http://lyricsystem.com/kate-bush/ |archive-date=12 October 2007}}</ref> Her brother Paddy played the harmonica and mandolin. [[Stuart Elliott (drummer)|Stuart Elliott]] played some of the drums and became her main drummer on subsequent albums.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lyrics booklets from Kate Bush's albums |publisher=[[EMI]]}}</ref> ''The Kick Inside'' was released when Bush was 19, with some songs written when she was as young as 13. EMI originally wanted the more rock-oriented track "James and the Cold Gun" to be her debut single, but Bush, who already had a reputation for asserting herself in decisions about her work, insisted that it should be "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]".<ref name="Rebel" />

In the United Kingdom alone, ''The Kick Inside'' sold over a million copies.<ref name=":1" /> "Wuthering Heights" topped the UK and Australian charts and became an international hit.<ref name=":0" /> Bush became the first British woman to reach number one on the UK charts with a self-written song.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1581815,00.html |title=Guardian profile: Kate Bush |work=[[The Guardian]] |last=Barkham |first=Patrick |date=30 September 2005 |location=London}}</ref> "[[The Man with the Child in His Eyes]]" made it onto the American [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] where it reached number 85 in early 1979, and went on to win her an [[Ivor Novello Award]] in 1979 for Outstanding British Lyric.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://theenvelope.latimes.com |title=Awards Database |publisher=The Envelope}}</ref> According to ''[[Guinness World Records]]'', Bush was the first female artist in pop history to have written every track on a million-selling debut album.<ref name=":1" />

Bob Mercer blamed Bush's lesser success in the United States on American radio formats, saying there were no outlets for Bush's visual presentation.<ref name="Mercer" /> EMI capitalised on Bush's appearance by promoting the album with a poster of her in a tight pink top that emphasised her breasts. In an interview with ''[[NME]]'' in 1982, Bush criticised the choice: "People weren't even generally aware that I wrote my own songs or played the piano. The media just promoted me as a female body. It's like I've had to prove that I'm an artist in a female body."<ref name="Rebel" /> In late 1978, EMI persuaded Bush to quickly record a follow-up album, ''[[Lionheart (Kate Bush album)|Lionheart]]'', to take advantage of the success of ''The Kick Inside''. The album was produced by Andrew Powell, assisted by Bush. While it gained high sales and spawned the hit single "[[Wow (Kate Bush song)|Wow]]", it did not reach the success of ''The Kick Inside'', reaching number six in the UK album charts. She went on to express dissatisfaction with ''Lionheart'', feeling that it had needed more time.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Whole Story album lyrics booklet |publisher=[[EMI]] |year=1986}}</ref>

Bush set up her own publishing company, Kate Bush Music, and her own management company, Novercia, to maintain control of her work. Members of her family, along with Bush herself, composed the board of directors.<ref name="Rebel" /> Following the release of ''Lionheart'', she was required by EMI to undertake heavy promotional work and an exhausting tour.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stand By Your Mantra |work=Classic Rock |year=2004}}</ref> [[The Tour of Life]] began in April 1979 and lasted six weeks. It was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "an extraordinary, hydra-headed beast, combining music, dance, poetry, mime, burlesque, magic and theatre".<ref name=":2" /> The show was co-devised and performed on stage with magician [[Simon Drake]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magicweek.co.uk/magic_profiles/magicprofile_0001_simon_drake.htm |title=Simon Drake – The Illusionist |year=2000 |publisher=magicweek.co.uk}}</ref> Bush was involved in every aspect of the production, choreography, set design, costume design and hiring.<ref name="Rebel" /> The shows were noted for her dancing, complex lighting and her 17 costume changes per show. Because of her need to dance as she sang, sound engineers used a wire coat hanger and a [[Wireless microphone|radio microphone]] to fashion a headset microphone; it was the first used by a rock performer since [[the Spotnicks]] used a rudimentary version in the early 1960s.<ref name="AllMusicBio" /><ref>{{cite news |last=Badhorn |first=Philippe |title=Interview in Rolling Stone (France) |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 2006}}</ref>

===1980–1984: ''Never for Ever'' and ''The Dreaming''===
Released in September 1980, ''[[Never for Ever]]'' saw Bush's second foray into production, co-producing with [[Jon Kelly]]. Her first experience as a producer was on her ''[[On Stage (EP)|Live on Stage]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], released after her tour the previous year. The first two albums had resulted in a definitive sound evident in every track, with orchestral arrangements supporting the live band sound. The range of styles on ''Never for Ever'' is much more diverse, veering from the straightforward rocker "Violin" to the wistful waltz of hit single "[[Army Dreamers]]".

''Never for Ever'' was her first album to feature synthesisers and drum machines, in particular the [[Fairlight CMI]], to which she was introduced when providing backing vocals on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s eponymous [[Peter Gabriel (1980 album)|third album]] in early 1980.<ref name="Rebel" /> It was her first record to reach the top position in the UK album charts, also making her the first female British artist to achieve that status,<ref name="MightyBush" /> and the first female artist ever to enter the album chart at the top.<ref name="officialcharts.com" /> The top-selling single from the album was "[[Babooshka (song)|Babooshka]]", which reached number five in the UK singles chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=katebush&cat=Alternative&full=Kate%20Bush |title=Kate Bush |publisher=UnderGroundOnline |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616011817/http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=katebush&cat=Alternative&full=Kate%20Bush |archive-date=16 June 2011}}</ref> In November 1980, she released the standalone [[Christmas music|Christmas single]] "[[December Will Be Magic Again]]", which reached number 29 in the UK charts.

September 1982 saw the release of ''[[The Dreaming (album)|The Dreaming]]'', the first album Bush produced by herself.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/music/something-from-kate/2005/10/06/1128562936076.html?page=3 |title=Something from Kate, at last |work=The Age |date=8 October 2005 |location=Australia}}</ref> With her new-found freedom, she experimented with production techniques, creating an album that features a diverse blend of musical styles and is known for its near-exhaustive use of the Fairlight CMI. ''The Dreaming'' received a mixed reception in the UK, and critics were baffled by the dense soundscapes Bush had created to become "less accessible".<ref>''[[Smash Hits]]'' magazine, reviews of ''The Dreaming'' (September 1982)</ref> In a 1993 interview with ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine, Bush stated: "That was my 'She's gone mad' album."<ref name="Rebel" /> However, the album became her first to enter the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, albeit only reaching number 157.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/kate-bush/chart-history/tlp/ |title=Kate Bush The Dreaming Chart History |work=Billboard |access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref> The album entered the UK album chart at number-three,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/the-dreaming/ |title=the dreaming {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company |website=[[OfficialCharts.com]] |language=en |access-date=4 March 2018}}</ref> but is to date her lowest-selling album, garnering "only" a silver disc.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/bpi-awards/ |title=British album certifications – Kate Bush – The Dreaming |website=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |type=Enter The Dreaming in the search field and then press Enter.|access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>

"[[Sat in Your Lap]]" was the first single from the album to be released. It pre-dated the album by over a year and peaked at number 11 in the UK.<ref name="OfficialCharts" /> The [[The Dreaming (song)|title track]], featuring [[Rolf Harris]] and [[Percy Edwards]], stalled at number 48,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/the-dreaming/ |title=the dreaming {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company |website=[[OfficialCharts.com]] |language=en |access-date=18 March 2018}}</ref> while the third single, "[[There Goes a Tenner]]", stalled at number 93,<ref>UK singles chart peak for "There Goes a Tenner": {{cite web |url=http://i.imgur.com/G29Jpul.jpg |title=UK Mix forums > Chart Histories page 78 |publisher=ukmix.org |access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref> despite promotion from EMI and Bush. The track "[[Suspended in Gaffa]]" was released as a single in Europe, but not in the UK.

Continuing in her storytelling tradition, Bush looked far outside her own personal experience for sources of inspiration. She drew on old crime films for "There Goes a Tenner", a documentary about the [[Vietnam War]] for "Pull Out the Pin", and the plight of [[Indigenous Australians]] for "The Dreaming". "Houdini" is about [[Harry Houdini|the magician]]'s death, and "Get Out of My House" was inspired by [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[The Shining (novel)|The Shining]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Dreamtime Is Over |author=Simper, Paul |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |date=16 October 1982}}</ref>

}}
''[[Hounds of Love]]'' was released in 1985. Because of the high cost of hiring studio space for her previous album, she built a private studio near her home, where she could work at her own pace.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1582789,00.html |last=Ellen |first=Barbara |title=Comeback Kate |work=The Observer |date=2 October 2005 |location=London}}</ref> ''Hounds of Love'' ultimately topped the charts in the UK, knocking [[Madonna]]'s ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' from the number-one position.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fitzgerald Morris |first=Peter |title=Hounds of Love lyrics booklet |publisher=[[EMI]] |year=1997}}</ref>

The album takes advantage of the vinyl and cassette formats with two very different sides. The first side, ''Hounds of Love'', contains five "accessible" pop songs, including the four singles "[[Running Up that Hill]]", "[[Cloudbusting]]", "[[Hounds of Love (song)|Hounds of Love]]", and [[The Big Sky (song)|"The Big Sky"]]. "Running Up that Hill" reached number three in the UK charts and re-introduced Bush to American listeners, climbing to number 30 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in November 1985. The second side of the album, ''The Ninth Wave'', takes its name from [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson's]] poem, "[[Idylls of the King]]", about the legendary King Arthur's reign, and is seven interconnecting songs joined in one continuous piece of music.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kate Bush radio interview |publisher=Rock Over London with Paul Cooke |year=1985}}</ref>

The album earned Bush nominations for Best Female Solo Artist, Best Album, Best Single, and Best Producer at the 1986 [[BRIT Awards]]. In the same year, Bush and Peter Gabriel had a UK Top 10 hit with the duet "[[Don't Give Up (Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush song)|Don't Give Up]]" ([[Dolly Parton]], Gabriel's original choice to sing the female vocal, turned his offer down),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/peter-gabriel/59311 |title=Peter Gabriel: 'Kate Bush replaced Dolly Parton on "Don't Give Up"' NME 19 September 2011 |work=[[NME]] |date=19 September 2011}}</ref> and EMI released her "greatest hits" album, ''[[The Whole Story]]''. Bush provided a new lead vocal and refreshed backing track on "Wuthering Heights", and recorded a new single, "[[Experiment IV]]", for inclusion on the compilation. [[Dawn French]] and [[Hugh Laurie]] were among those featured in the video for Experiment IV. At the 1987 BRIT Awards, Bush won the award for Best Female Solo Artist.

===1989–1993: ''The Sensual World'' and ''The Red Shoes''===
Released in 1989, ''[[The Sensual World]]'' was described by Bush herself as "her most honest, personal album".<ref>{{cite web |date=19 January 2019 |last1=Hewitt |first1=Ben |title=Kate Bush: The Sensual World |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kate-bush-the-sensual-world/ |website=Pitchfork |access-date=19 July 2019 |language=en}}</ref> One of the tracks, "Heads We're Dancing", inspired by her own [[black humour]], is about a woman who dances all night with a charming stranger only to discover in the morning that he is [[Adolf Hitler]].

In 1990, the boxed set ''[[This Woman's Work: Anthology 1978–1990|This Woman's Work]]'' was released; it included all of her albums with their original cover art, as well as two discs of all her singles' B-sides recorded from 1978 to 1990. In 1991, Bush released a cover of [[Elton John]]'s "[[Rocket Man (song)|Rocket Man]]", which reached number 12 in the UK singles chart,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everyhit.com/ |title=UK Top 40 Hit Database |publisher=EveryHit.com}}</ref> and reached number two in Australia.

Bush's seventh studio album, ''[[The Red Shoes (album)|The Red Shoes]]'', was released in November 1993. The album gave Bush her highest chart position in the US, reaching number 28, although the only song from the album to make the US singles chart was "Rubberband Girl", which peaked at number 88 in January 1994. In the UK, the album reached number-two, and the singles "Rubberband Girl", "The Red Shoes", "Moments of Pleasure", and "And So Is Love" all reached the top 30.<ref name="OfficialCharts" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Kate-Bush-Back-On-Stage-After-12-Years-7653.shtml |title=Back On Stage After 12 Years |publisher=Softpedia.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910195649/http://news.softpedia.com/news/Kate-Bush-Back-On-Stage-After-12-Years-7653.shtml |archive-date=10 September 2014}}</ref> Bush directed and starred in the short film ''[[The Line, the Cross and the Curve]]'', which featured music from her album ''The Red Shoes'', itself inspired by [[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|the 1948 film of that name]]. It was released on VHS in the UK in 1994 and also received a small number of cinema screenings around the world.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=Aizlewood, John |date=December 2001 |title=The Big Sleep |magazine=Q}}</ref><ref>Mojo Magazine, page 81, October 2005 edition</ref>

The initial plan had been to tour with ''The Red Shoes'' release, but did not reach fruition. Thus, Bush deliberately produced her tracks live, with less studio production that had typified her last three albums and which would have been too difficult to re-create on stage.<ref>{{cite news |title=Well red |work=Future Music |date=November 1993}}</ref> The result polarised her fan base, who had enjoyed the intricacy of her earlier compositions,<ref>{{cite news |last=Gettelman |first=Parry |title=The Red Shoes review |work=The Orlando Sentinel |year=1993}}</ref> with other fans claiming they had found new complexities in the lyrics and the emotions they expressed.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Red Shoes review |work=Request |date=November 1993}}</ref>

During this period, Bush had suffered a series of bereavements, including the loss of guitarist [[Alan Murphy]], who had started working with her on The Tour of Life in 1979, and her mother Hannah, to whom she was exceptionally close.<ref name="MightyBush" /> The people she lost were honoured in the ballad "Moments of Pleasure." However, Bush's mother was still alive when "Moments of Pleasure" was written and recorded. Bush describes playing the song to her mother, who thought the line where she is quoted by Bush as saying, "Every old sock meets an old shoe", was hilarious and "couldn't stop laughing."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gtnyf |title=Interview with Ken Bruce on Radio 2, 9 May 2011 |work=[[BBC Radio 2]]}}</ref>

===1994–2006: Motherhood, hiatus, and ''Aerial''===
After the release of ''The Red Shoes'', Kate Bush dropped out of the public eye. She had originally intended to take one year off, but despite working on material, twelve years passed before her next album release. Her name occasionally cropped up in the media with rumours of a new album release. The press often viewed her as an eccentric recluse, sometimes drawing a comparison with [[Miss Havisham]] from [[Charles Dickens]]'s ''[[Great Expectations]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Guardian profile: Kate Bush |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=28 September 2005 |last=Barkham |first=Patrick}}</ref> In 1998, Bush gave birth to Albert, known as "Bertie", fathered by guitarist Dan McIntosh, whom she met in 1992.<ref name="MightyBush" /><ref name="War of Wuthering Heights" /> In 2001, Bush was awarded a [[Q Awards|Q Award]] as Classic Songwriter.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-29123617 |title=Kate Bush earns two Q Award nods |date=9 September 2014 |work=BBC News |access-date=11 March 2018 |language=en-GB}}</ref> In 2002, she was awarded an [[Ivor Novello Award]] for Outstanding Contribution to Music, and performed "[[Comfortably Numb]]" at David Gilmour's concert at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London.

Kate Bush's eighth studio album, ''[[Aerial (album)|Aerial]]'', was released on double CD and vinyl in November 2005.<ref name="MightyBush" /> The album single "[[King of the Mountain (Kate Bush song)|King of the Mountain]]", had its premiere on [[BBC Radio 2]] two months prior.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://icscotland.icnetwork.co.uk/whatson/whatson2/tm_objectid=16160326&method=full&siteid=50141&headline=kate-bush-back-on-form-with-first-single-in-12-years-name_page.html |title=Kate Bush back on form with first single in 12 years |publisher=icScotland.com |date=2 September 2005 |last=McKenna |first=Stephen |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418055816/http://icscotland.icnetwork.co.uk/whatson/whatson2/tm_objectid%3D16160326%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D50141%26headline%3Dkate-bush-back-on-form-with-first-single-in-12-years-name_page.html |archive-date=18 April 2012}}</ref> The single entered the UK Downloads Chart at number six,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.distantstar.org.uk/DigitalDownloadChartBook.pdf|title=Official UK Download Chart Book (File corrupt 081209)|publisher=DigitalStar.org.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106072642/http://www.distantstar.org.uk/DigitalDownloadChartBook.pdf|archive-date=6 January 2007}}</ref> and would become Bush's third-highest-charting single ever in the UK, peaking at number four on the full chart.<ref name=":0" /> ''Aerial'' entered the UK albums chart at number three,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/4433752.stm|title=Operatic act beat Bush to the top|date=13 November 2005|work=BBC News}}</ref> and the US chart at number 48.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1513846/20051116/50_cent.jhtml|title=50 Cent Gets A Billboard Beating From Zellweger's Ex|date=16 November 2005|publisher=MTV}}</ref>

''Aerial,'' like ''Hounds of Love'' (1985), is divided into two sections, each with its own theme and mood. The first disc, subtitled ''A Sea of Honey'', features a set of unrelated themed songs, including "King of the Mountain"; "Bertie", a Renaissance-style ode to her son; and "Joanni", based on the story of [[Joan of Arc]]. In the song "<math>\pi</math>", Bush sings 117 digits of [[Pi|the number pi]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Ben Thompson reviews an album of two halves |work=[[The Sunday Telegraph]] |date=5 November 2006 |last=Thompson |first=Ben}}</ref> The second disc, subtitled ''A Sky of Honey'', features one continuous piece of music describing the experience of 24 hours passing by.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/aerial-mw0000347992|title=Aerial|last=Jurek|first=Thom|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref> ''Aerial'' earned Bush two nominations at the 2006 BRIT Awards, for Best British Female Solo Artist and Best British Album.<ref name="brits" />

===2007–2013: ''Director's Cut'' and ''50 Words for Snow''===
In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for ''[[The Golden Compass (film)|The Golden Compass]]'' soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, [[Lyra Belacqua]]. The song, "[[Lyra (song)|Lyra]]", was used in the closing credits of the film, reached number 187 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zobbel.de/cluk/CLUK_B.HTM|title=Chart Log UK: Darren B – David Byrne|publisher=Zobbel.de}}</ref> and was nominated for the [[International Press Academy]]'s [[Satellite Awards|Satellite Award]] for original song in a motion picture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/?p=3036|title=Tis the Awards Season: Lots of Green & "Golden" Loving Stars|author=Silberman, Stacey|date=30 November 2007|work=Hollywood Today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312094150/http://www.hollywoodtoday.net/?p=3036|archive-date=12 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> According to Del Palmer, Bush was asked to compose the song on short notice and the project was completed in 10&nbsp;days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delpalmer.com/page14.htm|title=Lyra|author=Palmer, Del|publisher=DelPalmer.com|access-date=15 May 2008|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304145801/http://delpalmer.com/page14.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In May 2011, Bush released the album ''[[Director's Cut (Kate Bush album)|Director's Cut]],'' comprising 11 reworked tracks from ''The Sensual World'' and ''The Red Shoes'', recorded using analogue rather than digital equipment. All the tracks have new lead vocals, drums, and instrumentation. Some were transposed to a lower key to accommodate her lowering voice. Three of the songs, including "[[This Woman's Work]]", have been completely rerecorded, with lyrics often changed in places. Bush described the album as a new project rather than a collection of remixes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b010vxyv/Front_Row_Kate_Bush_in_a_rare_interview_and_John_Cleese_reviewed/ |title=BBC iPlayer – Front Row: Kate Bush in a rare interview; and John Cleese reviewed |publisher=[[BBC Radio 4]] |date=4 May 2011}}</ref> It was the first album on her new label, ''Fish People'', a division of EMI Records. In addition to ''Director's Cut'' in its single CD form, the album was released with a box-set that contains the albums ''The Sensual World'' and the analogue re-mastered ''The Red Shoes''. It debuted at number two on the United Kingdom chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471173/pitbull-tops-uk-singles-chart-kate-bush-album-debuts-at-no-2|title=Pitbull Tops U.K. Singles Chart; Kate Bush Album Debuts At No. 2|date=23 May 2011|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref>

Bush's next studio album, ''[[50 Words for Snow]]'', was released on 21 November 2011.

''50 Words for Snow'' received general acclaim from music critics.

On 6 December 2018, Bush published her first book, a compilation of lyrics entitled, ''How to Be Invisible''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/sep/10/kate-bush-book-lyrics-david-mitchell-how-to-be-invisible|title=Kate Bush to publish book of lyrics, introduced by David Mitchell|last=Snapes|first=Laura|date=10 September 2018|website=The Guardian|language=en|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571350940-how-to-be-invisible.html|title=How To Be Invisible-Kate Bush|access-date=13 November 2020}}</ref>

In October 2018, Bush announced two boxsets of remasters of her studio albums, released on 16 and 30 November. Vocals from [[Rolf Harris]], who was convicted of multiple sexual assault charges in 2014, were replaced by versions by Bush's son Bertie.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/105175-kate-bush-replaces-rolf-harris-on-lp-remaster/|title=Kate Bush replaces Rolf Harris on LP remaster|date=15 November 2018|work=The List|access-date=20 November 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> The compilation of rare tracks, cover versions and remixes was released separately and titled ''The Other Sides'' on 8 March 2019.

In April 2021, Bush was one of 156 signatories of an [[open letter]] to [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], [[Boris Johnson]], calling for changes to be made to the economic model of streaming.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/20/paul-mccartney-kate-bush-law-change-music-streaming-payment |title=Paul McCartney and Kate Bush lead call for change to music streaming payments |publisher=theguardian |date=20 April 2021 |access-date=7 May 2021}}</ref> They proposed a change in the wording of the 1988 Copyright Act to bring royalty payments more in line with how those in radio are paid, while acknowledging the very different on-demand nature of streaming. The change in the law, the signatories argued, would mean that streaming companies would have to make "equitable remuneration" to artists via a rights collection company, a method already enshrined in British law for music played on the radio.

==Artistry==

===Musical style and voice===
[[File:Fairlight.JPG|right|thumb|194x194px|Bush has prominently used the [[Fairlight CMI]] sampler.]]
Bush's musical aesthetic is [[eclecticism in music|eclectic]], and is known to employ varied influences and meld disparate styles, often within a single song or over the course of an album.<ref name="AllMusicBio" /> Even in her earliest works, with piano the primary instrument, she wove together diverse influences, drawing on classical music, [[glam rock]],<ref name="Simon Reynolds" /> and a wide range of ethnic and [[folk music|folk]] sources. This has continued throughout her career. By the time of ''[[Never for Ever]]'', Bush had begun to make prominent use of the [[Fairlight CMI]] synthesiser, which allowed her to [[sample (music)|sample]] and manipulate sounds, expanding her sonic palette.<ref name="Rebel" /> She has been compared with other "'arty' 1970s and '80s British pop rock artists" such as [[Roxy Music]] and [[Peter Gabriel]].{{r|Ray (2012) p.107}} ''[[The Guardian]]'' called Bush "the queen of art-pop".<ref name="Simon Reynolds" />

Bush has a [[dramatic soprano]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2005-11-17-kate-bush_x.htm |title=Kate Bush picks it up in 'Aerial' |work=[[USA Today]] |date=17 November 2005 |first1=Elysa |last1=Gardner |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151014173715/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2005-11-17-kate-bush_x.htm |archive-date=14 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref> Her vocals contain elements of British, [[Anglo-Irish]] and most prominently (southern) English accents and, in its use of musical instruments from various periods and cultures, her music has differed from American pop norms.<ref name="Englishness" /> Reviewers have used the term "surreal" to describe her music.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://gaffa.org/reaching/i85_hifi.html |title=The Unique Poetry Of Kate Bush |magazine=Hi-Fi & Record Review |first=Sue |last=Hudson |date=December 1985}}</ref> Her songs explore melodramatic emotional and musical surrealism that defies easy categorisation.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Back Page |work=Hi-Fi and Record Review |last=Hudson |first=Sue}}</ref> It has been observed that even her more joyous pieces are often tinged with traces of melancholy and vice versa.<ref>{{cite news |title=Red Shoes review |work=Spin|year=1993 |last=Davis |first=Erik}}</ref>

===Songwriting and influences===
Elements of Bush's lyrics employ historical or literary references, as embodied in her first single "Wuthering Heights", which is based on [[Emily Brontë]]'s [[Wuthering Heights|novel of the same name]]. She has described herself as a storyteller who embodies the character singing the song and has dismissed efforts by others to conceive of her work as autobiographical.<ref name="Englishness" /><ref name="Radio4052011" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01131qg |title=BBC Radio 2 – Mark Radcliffe's Music Club, 17/05/2011 |publisher=[[BBC Radio 2]] |date=17 May 2011}}</ref> Bush's lyrics have been known to touch on obscure or esoteric subject matter, and ''[[New Musical Express]]'' noted that Bush was not afraid to tackle sensitive and taboo subjects in her work.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Barmy Dreamer |last=Solanas |first=Jane |work=NME |year=1983}}</ref> "The Kick Inside" is based on a traditional English folk song ([[Lizie Wan|''The Ballad of Lucy Wan'']]) about an incestuous pregnancy and a resulting suicide.<ref>{{cite news |title=Iron Maiden |author=Colin Irwin |work=Q |date=November 1989}}</ref> "Kashka from Baghdad" is a song about a gay couple; ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine listed two of her albums in their "Top 100 Greatest Gayest Albums" list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2012/03/19/100-greatest-gayest-albums-all-time |title=100 Greatest Gayest Albums 51–60 |work=[[Out (magazine)|Out]]|date=19 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Labushka |author=Phil Sutcliffe |work=Sounds |date=30 August 1980}}</ref> She has referenced [[G. I. Gurdjieff]] in the song "[[Them Heavy People]]", while "[[Cloudbusting]]" was inspired by Peter Reich's autobiography, ''A Book of Dreams'', about his relationship with his father, [[Wilhelm Reich]]. "[[Breathing (Kate Bush song)|Breathing]]" explores the results of nuclear fallout from the perspective of a fœtus.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kate Bush interview |work=[[Smash Hits]] |year=1980}}</ref>

Other non-musical sources of inspiration for Bush include horror films, which have influenced the [[gothic rock|gothic]] nature of her songs, such as "Hounds of Love", which samples the 1957 horror movie ''[[Night of the Demon]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hounds of Love Sleeve Notes |work=Q |date=June 1991 |last=Sutcliffe |first=Phil}}</ref> "The Infant Kiss" is a song about a haunted, unstable woman's paedophilic infatuation with a young boy in her care (inspired by [[Jack Clayton]]'s film ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' (1961), which had been based on [[Henry James]]'s novella ''[[The Turn of the Screw]]'');.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kate Bush interview |work=Q |year=1990}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.out.com/entertainment/music/2012/03/19/100-greatest-gayest-albums-all-time |title=Top 100 Greatest Gayest albums 81–90 |work=Out|date=19 March 2012 }}</ref> Her songs have occasionally combined comedy and horror to form dark humour, such as murder by poisoning in "Coffee Homeground", an alcoholic mother in "Ran Tan Waltz" and the upbeat "The Wedding List", a song inspired by [[François Truffaut]]'s 1967 film of [[Cornell Woolrich]]'s ''[[The Bride Wore Black]]'' about the murder of a groom and the bride's subsequent revenge against the killer.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Paranoia and Passion of the Kate Inside |author=Irwin, Colin |magazine=[[Melody Maker]] |date=10 October 1980}}</ref> Bush has also cited comedy as a significant influence. She has cited [[Woody Allen]],<ref>{{cite news |title=In the Realm of the Senses |work=[[NME]] |date=7 October 1989 |last=Brown |first=Len}}</ref> ''[[Monty Python]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', and ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''<ref name="LittleMiss" /> as particular favourites.

===Technical innovations===
Bush is regarded {{by whom|date=July 2020}} as the first artist to have had a [[headset (audio)|headset]] with a [[wireless microphone]] built for use in music. For her ''[[The Tour of Life|Tour of Life]]'' in 1979 she had a compact [[microphone]] combined with a self-made construction of wire [[clothes hanger]]s, so that she did not have to use a hand microphone and had her hands free and could dance her rehearsed choreography of [[expressionist dance]] on the concert stage and sing with a microphone at the same time. Later, her idea was adopted by other artists such as [[Janet Jackson]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mehr|first=Bob|title=Review: Janet Jackson offers spectacle and intimacy at FedExForum concert|url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2017/12/07/review-janet-jackson-offers-spectacle-and-intimacy-fedexforum-concert/927530001/|url-access=limited|access-date=2021-07-29|website=The Commercial Appeal|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Madonna]] and [[Peter Gabriel]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Laborey|first=Claire|url=https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/082765-000-A/kate-bush-stimmgewaltig-und-exzentrisch/|title=Kate Bush – Stimmgewaltig und exzentrisch|trans-title=Kate Bush – Vocally powerful and eccentric|publisher=[[Arte]] France|language=de|year= 2019 |access-date=21 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190921211131/https://www.arte.tv/de/videos/082765-000-A/kate-bush-stimmgewaltig-und-exzentrisch/|archive-date=21 September 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Live performances==
{{further|The Tour of Life|Before the Dawn (Kate Bush concert residency)}}
Bush's only tour, the Tour of Life, ran for six weeks in May 1979, covering Britain and mainland Europe.<ref name=":2" /> The BBC suggested that she may have quit touring due to a [[fear of flying]], or because of the death of a lighting engineer, Bill Duffield, who was killed in an accident during a warmup concert.<ref name=":4" /> Mercer, who signed Bush to EMI, said touring was "just too hard ... I think [Bush] liked it but the equation didn't work ... I could see at the end of the show that she was completely wiped out."<ref name=":2" /> Bush described the tour as "enormously enjoyable" but "absolutely exhausting".<ref name=":4" />

In 1990 Bush produced a song for another artist, [[Alan Stivell]]'s "Kimiad" for his album ''[[Again (Alan Stivell album)|Again]]''; this is the only time she has done this to date. Stivell had appeared on ''The Sensual World''. In 1991, Kate Bush was invited to perform a cover of [[Elton John]]'s 1972 song "[[Rocket Man/Candle in the Wind|Rocket Man]]" for the tribute album ''[[Two Rooms: Celebrating the Songs of Elton John & Bernie Taupin]]''.

Artists who have contributed to Bush's own albums include [[Elton John]], [[Eric Clapton]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[David Gilmour]], [[Nigel Kennedy]], [[Gary Brooker]], [[Danny Thompson]], and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]]. Bush provided backing vocals for a song that was recorded during the 1990s titled ''Wouldn't Change a Thing'' by Lionel Azulay, the drummer with the original band that was later to become the KT Bush Band. The song, which was engineered and produced by Del Palmer, was released on Azulay's album ''Out of the Ashes''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.katebushnews.com/index.php/2008/08/lost-kate-vocal-performance-surfaces-on-itunes/ |title=Lost Kate Vocal Performance surfaces on iTunes! |publisher=KateBushNews.com |date=26 August 2008 |last=Twomey |first=Seán}}</ref> Bush declined a request by [[Erasure]] to produce one of their albums because, according to [[Vince Clarke]], "she didn't feel that that was her area".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/01240-erasure-wanted-to-work-with-kate-bush |title=Erasure & Kate Bush: The Lost Collaboration |work=[[The Quietus]] |date=4 March 2009}}</ref>

But I really don't think I've found a niche.{{r|Q magazine}}}}

The length of time between albums has led to rumours concerning Bush's health or appearance.<ref name="LittleMiss" /><ref>{{cite news |title=The Return of a Sultry Songstress |work=[[The New York Sun]] |date=8 November 2005 |last=Ziegler |first=Mollie}}</ref> In 2011, she told [[BBC Radio 4]] that the amount of time between albums was stressful: "It's very frustrating the albums take as long as they do&nbsp;... I wish there weren't such big gaps between them". In the same interview, she denied that she was a perfectionist, saying: "I think it's important that things are flawed&nbsp;... That's what makes a piece of art interesting sometimes – the bit that's wrong or the mistake you've made that's led onto an idea you wouldn't have had otherwise." She reiterated her prioritisation of her family life.<ref name="Radio4052011" />

Bush's son Bertie (Albert McIntosh), featured prominently in the 2014 concert Before the Dawn. Her nephew, Raven Bush, is a violinist in the English indie band [[Syd Arthur]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/feb/15/new-band-syd-arthur|title=New band of the day – No 726: Syd Arthur|first=Paul|last=Lester|date=15 February 2010|website=The Guardian|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref>

=== Political views ===
Some of Bush's songs have contained references to what critics have interpreted as political and social themes, such as "[[Breathing (Kate Bush song)|Breathing]]" which addresses the fear of nuclear warfare and "[[Army Dreamers]]" which examined the grief felt by mothers who lose children serving in the military during war.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Kate-bush-breathing-lyrics|title=Kate Bush – Breathing Lyrics {{!}} Genius Lyrics|date=15 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415201240/https://genius.com/Kate-bush-breathing-lyrics|url-status=dead|archive-date=2019-04-15|access-date=15 April 2019}}</ref> The tracks "[[Wow (Kate Bush song)|Wow]]" and "Kashka from Baghdad" contain references to gay and LGBT themes. In a 1985 interview with ''[[The NewMusic]],'' Bush stated "I've never felt I've written from a political point of view, it's always been an emotional point of view that just happens to perhaps be a political situation."<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050426133822/https://children.ofthenight.org/cloudbusting/subjects/politics.html</ref>

During the [[1979 United Kingdom general election]] campaign, Bush, who at the time was on a live concert tour of the UK, posed for a photograph alongside the Labour Prime Minister [[James Callaghan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://reviews.history.ac.uk/review/1711 |title=Crisis? What Crisis? The Callaghan Government and the British 'Winter of Discontent' |work=Reviews in history |date=January 2015 |access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref> When asked about her political beliefs in a 1985 interview with ''[[Hot Press]]'', Bush replied that she preferred not to discuss how she voted and added "I don't feel I am a political thinker at all. I don't really understand politics."<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20050426133822/https://children.ofthenight.org/cloudbusting/subjects/politics.html</ref> 

In [[The Comic Strip Presents|the ''Comic Strip Presents'']] episode ''[[GLC: The Carnage Continues...]]'', she produced and sang on the theme song ''Ken.'' The song was a satirical take on how Hollywood glamourises and fictionalises political figures, in this particular case [[Ken Livingstone]], the former leader of the [[Greater London Council]], and the lyrics parodied the [[theme from Shaft]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kate Bush Once Wrote A Song About Ken Livingstone |url=http://www.lbc.co.uk/kate-bush-once-wrote-a-song-about-ken-livingstone-88090 |date=28 March 2014 |accessdate=1 May 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919090621/http://www.lbc.co.uk/kate-bush-once-wrote-a-song-about-ken-livingstone-88090 |archivedate=19 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/staggers/2016/11/kate-bush-thinks-theresa-may-wonderful-and-its-not-first-time-shes-turned|title=Kate Bush thinks Theresa May is "wonderful" - and it's not the first time she's turned political|website=[[New Statesman]]|first=Julia|last=Rampen|date=29 November 2016|access-date=22 April 2021}}</ref>

In 2016, Canadian news magazine ''[[Maclean's]]'' published an interview in which Bush was asked about the role of misogyny in the defeat of [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 United States presidential election]]. Bush pointed out that the UK, unlike the US, did have a female premier, [[Theresa May]], who a few months earlier had become the Conservative Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. It quoted Bush as saying: "I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time ... It is great to have a woman in charge of the country. She's very sensible and I think that's a good thing at this point in time."<ref name=":3" /> In 2019, Bush published a clarifying statement on her website saying that she was not a tribal Tory supporter and did not endorse any political parties. She wrote: "Over the years, I have avoided making political comments in interviews. My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/kate-bush-says-she-does-not-support-tories-clarifying-2016-theresa-may-quote/|title = Kate Bush Says She Does Not Support Tories, Clarifying 2016 Theresa May Quote|website = [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date = 8 January 2019}}</ref>
