'''Amber Mary Bain''' (born 13 July 1995), known professionally as '''The Japanese House''', is an English [[indie pop]] musician from [[Buckinghamshire]]. Bain contributes vocals and plays guitar, synthesizer and keyboard for her music. As a teenager, Bain decided to pursue a career in music, having been taught music by her father during childhood. She began writing music under the moniker ''the Japanese House'' in 2012, after being introduced to Matty Healy of [[the 1975]], who offered to help produce her music under the label [[Dirty Hit]]. She first rose to prominence after the release of her first single, "Still", which was a critical success and premiered on [[BBC Radio 1]] presented by [[Zane Lowe]].

Bain's androgynous vocals, heavy use of production, and elusive media presence fuelled fan speculation about her gender and identity after her first few singles were released. In 2015, Bain released her debut [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Pools to Bathe In]]'' and the follow-up EP [[Clean (The Japanese House EP)|''Clean'']]. These first two EPs were rooted in [[indie pop]] and [[synth-pop]], and included experimentation with genres such as [[dream pop]], [[folktronica]], and [[electropop]]. She toured with Dirty Hit labelmates the 1975 and [[Wolf Alice]] in 2015 and 2016 before headlining tours of her own.

Her third EP, ''[[Swim Against the Tide]]'' (2016) was influenced by 80s synthpop and [[technopop]]. Her fourth EP, ''[[Saw You in a Dream]]'' (2017) saw her continued experimentation with different genres of [[electronica]] and rock. Bain co-produced her first full-length album ''[[Good at Falling]]'' (2019) with George Daniel and American record producer [[BJ Burton]]. Her fifth EP, ''[[The LA Sessions]]'' (2019), featured live recordings of reimagined tracks from ''Good at Falling'' and ''Saw You in a Dream''.

== Public image and anonymity ==
[[File:Sorakuen04s3200.jpg|thumb|A traditional Japanese Tea House]]
Bain began producing music professionally under the [[nom de plume]] "The Japanese House". She has stated that her reasons for using a pseudonym include not wanting to be defined by her gender and wanting to avoid the public eye. The name "The Japanese House" was inspired by a property in [[Cornwall]], England in which she and her family had vacationed during her childhood.

The property had been previously owned by [[Kate Winslet]], with furnishings reminiscent of traditional [[Chashitsu|Japanese tea houses]], which inspired Bain's musical moniker.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/rq8dpv/pools-to-bathe-in-an-interview-with-the-japanese-house|title=A Wander Into the Deep Blue World of The Japanese House|last=Bassil|first=Ryan|date=13 November 2015|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> During her week-long stay in the cottage, Bain posed as a boy, calling herself Danny. Her experiences there directly inspired the use of an anonymous label for her music as opposed to the use of her own name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dummymag.com/Features/the-japanese-house-interview-im-a-heartbreaker-what-can-i-say|title=Interview: The Japanese House|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|website=www.dummymag.com|access-date=5 December 2016}}</ref>

During her early career, Bain avoided photo shoots and publicity which, combined with her androgynous vocals, led many outlets to label her as an anonymous artist. After the release of her debut EP ''[[Pools to Bathe In]]'', fans speculated about her gender and identity, with some even claiming that The Japanese House was Matty Healy of [[the 1975]].<ref name=":10" />

Despite the shroud of anonymity which surrounded The Japanese House, Bain never hid her personal identity online. In a 2019 interview she noted that her official social media accounts even used her full name, Amber Bain.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/the-japanese-house-and-the-myth-of-anonymity|title=The Japanese House and the myth of anonymity|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en|access-date=13 January 2020}}</ref> She eventually became more public, appearing in interviews and photo shoots, stating that the reason for this was that she had become more comfortable with being in the spotlight and "didn't want the mystery to become bigger than the music".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2015/09/19/the-japanese-house-i-didnt-want-the-mystery-to-become-bigger-than-the-music-im-not-wearing-a-balaclava|title=The Japanese House: "I didn't want the mystery to become bigger than the music; I'm not wearing a balaclava"|website=diymag.com|language=en|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/under-the-radar-meet-the-japanese-house-amber-bain-4314|title=Under The Radar: The Japanese House|date=12 August 2016|website=NME|language=en-GB|access-date=28 January 2020}}</ref>

''Pools to Bathe In'' was a [[synth-pop]] album, and her subsequent releases have prominently incorporated synth-pop. Her experimental musical style also contains [[dream pop]], [[electropop]],<ref name=":2" /> [[synth-pop]], [[indie pop]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://seattlespectator.com/2019/03/06/new-music-japanese-house-falling/|title=New Music From The Japanese House Has You Falling For Them|last=Divinagracia|first=Frances|website=The Spectator|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> and [[alt pop]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordstudent.com/2016/11/18/interview-japanese-house/|title=Interview: The Japanese House|last=Ferguson|first=Rowan|date=18 November 2016|website=The Oxford Student|language=en-GB|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Andy Meek of [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] described Bain's discography as a combination of experimental [[electronica]] and "catchy pop hooks backed by drums and chugging guitars".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/pride/8545414/the-japanese-house-interview|title=After a Breakthrough 2019, Here's What's Next for The Japanese House|magazine=Billboard|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref>

Her later releases were increasingly influenced by [[art pop]] and rock music. ''Saw You in a Dream'' was a [[yacht rock]] album,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/news/latest-news/the-japanese-house-announces-new-ep-saw-you-in-a-dream|title=The Japanese House announces new EP Saw You In A Dream|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en|access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> while ''Good at Falling'' was influenced by rock and art pop.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://earmilk.com/album-reviews/636697/the-japanese-house/good-at-falling/|title=Album Review: The Japanese House's first full length "Good at Falling", is a gem of innocent maturity|website=EARMILK|language=en-US|access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> She is known for her atmospheric tracks and moody lyrical themes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/discovery/the-japanese-house-reveal-atmospheric-track-sister-from-upcoming-debut-ep|title=The Japanese House reveals atmospheric track "Sister" from upcoming debut EP|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Max Migowksi, writing for Indie Mag, summarized Bain's musical style as "[an] androgynous voice embedded in ethereal, post-indie pop synths with hints at gentle acoustic guitar".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indie-mag.com/2019/02/the-japanese-house-interview/|title=The Japanese House on breakups, breakdowns and breakthroughs -INDIE|date=19 February 2019|website=INDIE Magazine|language=en-GB|access-date=15 January 2020}}</ref>

Many of Bain's releases explore themes such as love, loss, solitude, and personal growth.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":5" /> Her later releases have been favorably compared to her first two EPs, with critics noting the more mature lyrics and refined composition of ''[[Swim Against the Tide]]'' and ''[[Good at Falling]]''. Bain's debut album ''Good at Falling'' was praised by its critics for its dark, heartfelt lyrics and light, pop melodies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/japanese-house-good-at-falling-2630212103.html|title=The Japanese House Offer Open Doors on Debut 'Good at Falling'|date=28 February 2019|website=PopMatters|language=en|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref>

=== Voice ===
Bain's singing voice has been compared to both [[contralto]] and [[tenor]], and has been especially noted for its androgyny.<ref name=":1" /> Critics have favorably compared her vocals to [[Victoria Legrand]] and [[Imogen Heap]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rockshotmagazine.com/live-japanese-house-dingwalls/|title=Live: The Japanese House @ Dingwalls RockShot Magazine|date=3 March 2016|language=en-GB|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> though Bain rejects comparisons to Heap.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opinionpolice.org/interviews/the-japanese-house-interview|title=The Japanese House – Interview|last=Tayler|first=Sean|date=6 January 2020|website=Opinion Police}}</ref> A distinctive feature of Bain's discography is her use of layered harmonies, often three tracks or more, which simulates the effect of a [[vocoder]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2015/09/19/the-japanese-house-i-didnt-want-the-mystery-to-become-bigger-than-the-music-im-not-wearing-a-balaclava|title=The Japanese House: "I didn't want the mystery to become bigger than the music; I'm not wearing a balaclava"|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Her use of overlapping harmonies to create "a kind of thick, organic Auto-tune [sic]" has been praised for lending depth to her tracks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/the-japanese-house-interview-2635942352.html|title=The Japanese House Isn't Hiding Anymore|date=1 May 2019|website=PAPER|language=en|access-date=14 January 2020}}</ref> Alice French of [[Varsity (Cambridge)|Varsity]] called Bain's vocals one of the highlights of her performance.<ref name=":2" />

== Personal life ==
Bain currently resides in [[East London]],<ref name=":0" /> and has a pet [[German Shepherd]] named Calvin. She has been open about her struggle with alcohol abuse, and stated that she became sober after the release of ''Good at Falling''.
