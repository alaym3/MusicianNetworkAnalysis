'''Aphrodite's Child''' was a [[Greece|Greek]] [[progressive rock]] band formed in 1967, by [[Vangelis|Vangelis Papathanassiou]] (keyboards, flutes), [[Demis Roussos]] (bass, acoustic and electric guitar, vocals), [[Loukas Sideras]] (drums and vocals), and [[Silver Koulouris]] (guitar).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> They initially found success in Europe with hit singles like "[[Rain and Tears]]", "End of the World", "I Want to Live", and "It's Five O'Clock". The band's career ended shortly after release of their most influential album, [[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|''666'']] (1972), which has appeared on a number of lists of the top progressive or psychedelic albums of all time.

==History==
===Origins===
Papathanassiou and Roussos had already been successful in [[Greece]] (playing in the bands The Forminx and Idols respectively) when they got together with Sideras and Koulouris (born 26 January 1947, Piraeus, Greece) to form a new band. Their band's name was derived from the title of a track from another [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] act, [[Dick Campbell (singer-songwriter)|Dick Campbell]], from his ''Sings Where It's At'' [[album]].

Their first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] as a band was for George Romanos' album ''In Concert and in Studio'' where they played on four songs and were credited as "Vangelis and his Orchestra". In the same year, they recorded a two-song [[demo (music)|demo]] and submitted it to [[Philips Records]]. It was probably Vangelis's idea that the still-anonymous band should be relocated to [[London]], which would be a more suitable environment for their music, as their country had entered a right-wing [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|dictatorship]] in 1967. This decision, however, was not problem-free. Koulouris had to stay in Greece to fulfill his military service, while the band, on their way to London, got stuck in [[Paris]] partly because they did not have the correct work permits and partly because of the strikes associated with the [[May 1968 protests in France|May 1968 events]].

===Paris, and first album===
In Paris the band signed to [[Mercury Records]] and were christened "Aphrodite's Child" by [[Lou Reizner]], releasing their second single "[[Rain and Tears]]", a reworking of [[Johann Pachelbel|Pachelbel]]'s [[Pachelbel's Canon|Canon in D major]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> With this song the band became an overnight sensation in France and several other European countries in which the single charted well, despite the song being sung in English. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first= Joseph |last= Murrells |year= 1978 |title= The Book of Golden Discs |edition= 2nd |publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location= London |pages= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/234 234–235] |isbn= 0-214-20512-6 |url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/234 }}</ref> In October of the same year, the band released their first album ''[[End of the World (album)|End of the World]]''.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=48}}</ref> The album contained equal amounts of [[psychedelic pop]] songs and ballads in the vein of [[Procol Harum]] or [[The Moody Blues]].

The band began touring around Europe, and in January 1969 they recorded a single in [[Italian language|Italian]] for the [[Sanremo Festival]], in which they did not participate. Their next [[hit single]] was "I Want to Live", an [[arrangement]] of the song "[[Plaisir d'amour]]".

===Recording in London and second album===
For their second album, the band traveled to London to record at the [[Trident Studios]]. The first single from the album, "Let Me Love, Let Me Live" was released in November, while the album ''[[It's Five O'Clock]]'' came out in January 1970.<ref name="Larkin"/> It featured more successful ballads (like the title song), but also songs that crossed many musical genres including [[country rock]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

After their second album, the band began touring again, this time without Vangelis who preferred to stay in Paris and record the music for [[Henry Chapier]]'s film, ''Sex Power''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Vangelis was replaced on stage by Harris Halkitis. The year 1970 went by with the band promoting their latest album and Vangelis working on his first film project. To keep the steady flow of hits, the band released another single in August 1970, "Spring, Summer, Winter and Fall".

===Third album – ''666'', and breakup===
{{main article | 666 (Aphrodite's Child album) | l1 = 666}}
In late 1970, the band began to record a musical adaptation of the [[Bible|biblical]] [[Book of Revelation]], entitled ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Koulouris, having finished his [[Greek army]] duty, rejoined the band. However, relations between the band members were declining, and things continued to worsen during the methodically slow recording process.

Essentially, the ambitious [[double album]] was Vangelis's concept, created with an outside lyricist, [[Costas Ferris]]. The music Vangelis composed was much more [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]]- and [[progressive rock]]-oriented than anything the band had done before. This did not sit well with the other band members, who wished to continue in the [[Pop music|pop]] direction that had brought them success.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Furthermore, Roussos was being groomed for a solo career, having recorded and released his first solo single "[[We Shall Dance]]" (with Sideras on drums) and his first solo album ''[[On the Greek Side of My Mind]]''.

Meanwhile, Vangelis turned his attention to recording the score for the 1970 French TV documentary ''[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des animaux]]'', and worked on a single with his then-girlfriend [[Vilma Ladopoulou]], performing with Koulouris under the pseudonym "Alpha Beta". By the time ''666'' was finally released almost two years later in June 1972, the band had already split up, despite having sold over 20 million albums and remaining popular throughout Europe.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elsew.com/data/repubb89.htm |title=Elsewhere: Interviews, La Repubblica, March 28, 1989 |publisher=Elsew.com |access-date=2015-08-19}}</ref>

Both Vangelis and Roussos pursued successful solo careers: Roussos had a thriving solo career as a pop singer, and Vangelis went on to become a highly regarded [[electronic music]] artist.<ref name="Larkin"/> Vangelis's work composing [[Film score|movie soundtracks]] brought him much success for the next three decades, including an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for ''[[Chariots of Fire (album)|Chariots of Fire]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> Vangelis's other soundtracks include [[Ridley Scott]]'s ''[[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|Blade Runner]]'' (1982), to which Roussos contributed vocals, ''[[1492: Conquest of Paradise (album)|1492: Conquest of Paradise]]'' (1992) and [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Alexander (soundtrack)|Alexander]]'' (2004). Roussos died in 2015.

Koulouris worked with both Roussos and Vangelis on occasion, while Sideras pursued a less successful solo career, releasing two albums and four singles after the break-up. As of 2017, Sideras still lived in Greece and performed with his band.

==Influence and legacy==
Despite their short existence and lack of hit singles outside of [[Europe]], the band is still regarded as a [[underground music|cult band]]. Their album ''666'' is often considered their masterpiece, in addition to being one of rock music's first [[concept album]]s.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album caught the attention of many musicians in the [[progressive rock]] field, including [[Yes (band)|Yes]] frontman [[Jon Anderson]], who would later collaborate with Vangelis (as [[Jon and Vangelis]]). Contemporary progressive rock acts such as [[Astra (band)|Astra]] have also cited the band as an influence.

==Covers and samples==
===Covers===
*In 2001, the german Heavy Metal band [[Axxis (band)|Axxis]] included a cover on their album ''Eyes Of Darkness''.
*In 2004, [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]] released a cover of "[[The Four Horsemen (Aphrodite's Child song)|The Four Horsemen]]" on their album ''[[The Dark Side (Gregorian album)|The Dark Side]]''.
*In 2005, German dance group [[Scooter (band)|Scooter]] released a [[Techno]] version of "The Four Horsemen" called ''The Leading Horse'' on their album ''Who's Got The Last Laugh Now?''.
*In 2015, the Greek band Cyanna Mercury (formerly known as [[Cyanna]]) covered "The Four Horsemen" on the [[Death Roots Syndicate]] compilation ''The End''.
*"The Four Horsemen" has proven an especially popular cover among European heavy metal bands. Bands that have covered the song include the Italian band [[Death SS]] (on their 2006 album ''The 7th Seal''), the Swedish doom metal band [[Griftegård]] (on an EP released through Ván Records in 2015), and the Greek black metal band [[Rotting Christ]] (on their 2016 album ''[[Rituals (Rotting Christ album)|Rituals]]'').

===Samples===
*In 1990, several tracks from the ''666'' album were sampled for the first [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]] album, ''[[MCMXC a.D.]]''.
*[[The Verve]]'s song "The Rolling People" (from their 1997 album ''[[Urban Hymns]]'') borrows its title from "Altamont", while also containing musical elements of "The Four Horsemen". Frontman [[Richard Ashcroft]] reportedly mentioned ''666'' as a strong influence on his music.
*[[Deltron 3030]] sampled the opening lyrics of 'Loud, Loud, Loud' in the track 'Mastermind'.
*[[Beck]]'s song "Chemtrails" (from his 2008 album ''[[Modern Guilt]]'') also resembles "The Four Horsemen".
*[[Daniel Lopatin]]'s song "A7" (from the album ''[[Chuck Person's Eccojams Vol. 1]]'') under the alias Chuck Person also samples the track "The Four Horsemen".
