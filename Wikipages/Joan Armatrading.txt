==Career==

===Late 1960s and 1970s===
[[File:Joan armatrading.jpg|thumb|230px|Armatrading in concert at the [[National Stadium, Dublin]], early 1980s]]                                 
Armatrading first performed in a concert at [[Birmingham University]] for her brother at the age of about 16. She only knew her own songs, but her brother asked her to perform something that would be familiar to the audience; she chose "[[The Sound of Silence]]".<ref name="telegraph"/> She then performed her own songs around the local area with a friend from school, and played bass- and rhythm-guitar at local clubs.<ref name="MendezCueto2003"/><ref name=npg/> In 1968 Armatrading joined a touring production of the stage musical [[Hair (musical)| ''Hair'']].<ref name="MendezCueto2003"/> There she met the lyricist [[Pam Nestor]] in 1970,<ref name="amgbio">{{allmusic|class= artist|id= p3572|label= Joan Armatrading biography|tab= biography|access-date= 28 September 2011}}</ref> and they worked together on Armatrading's debut album ''[[Whatever's for Us]]'', released by [[Cube Records]] in 1972.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book | first= Martin C. | last= Strong | year= 2000 | title= The Great Rock Discography | edition=5th | publisher= Mojo Books | location= Edinburgh | pages= 29–30 | isbn= 1-84195-017-3}}</ref> Nestor wrote the lyrics to 11 of the 14 songs on the album, while Armatrading wrote the lyrics to three of them, performed all the vocals, wrote all the music and played an array of instruments on the album. Although Nestor was credited as co-lyricist, Cube regarded Armatrading as the more likely [[star (person) | star]] material. These events produced a tension that broke up the partnership.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013|reason= according to whom?}}

On 28 November 1972 Armatrading appeared on the [[BBC Radio 1]] [[John Peel]] Show performing "Head of the Table", "Spend A Little Time", "Child Star" and "Whatever's For Us". She sang and played acoustic guitar and piano.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1970s/1974/Oct31joanarmatrading/|title= 31/10.1974 Joan Armatrading – Keeping It Peel at bbc.co.uk|access-date= 11 May 2018}}</ref> In 1973 Cube released  on the Fly label (catalogue: Bug 31) Armatrading's first single, "Lonely Lady" (with lyrics by Nestor), a song that had not been included on the album. It proved unsuccessful in the charts, and a period of inactivity for Armatrading followed while she extricated herself from her contract with Cube Records. The single was subsequently withdrawn by Cube and re-released as a promotional single in the US by Armatrading's new label [[A&M Records]], the same year (as A&M1452). In January 1974 she appeared again on the John Peel Show. Performing "Some Sort Of Love Song", "Lonely Lady" and "Freedom", she again sang and played acoustic guitar and piano, but was accompanied by supporting musicians [[Snowy White]] (guitar), Mike Tomich (bass) and Brian Glassock (drums).<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1970s/1974/Jan14joanarmatrading/|title= BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – 14/01/1974 Joan Armatrading|website= www.bbc.co.uk|access-date= 11 May 2018}}</ref>

In 1975 Armatrading was free to sign with [[A&M Records]], and issued the album ''[[Back to the Night]]'',<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> which was promoted{{by whom?|date=November 2020}} on tour with six-piece English jazz-pop group [[The Movies (UK band) |The Movies]]. Armatrading credited English singer [[Elkie Brooks]] on the sleeve notes as she had cooked for Armatrading and the band in the studio while they had been making the album, which was produced by Brooks' then husband [[Pete Gage (guitarist) |Pete Gage]]. A major publicity relaunch in 1976 and the involvement of producer [[Glyn Johns]] propelled her next album, ''[[Joan Armatrading (album) |Joan Armatrading]]'', into the [[Top 40| Top 20]] and spawned the Top-10 [[hit single]] "[[Love and Affection]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album mixed acoustic work with jazz-influenced material, and this style was retained for the 1977 follow-up [[Show Some Emotion (album)| ''Show Some Emotion'']], also produced by Glyn Johns, as was 1978's [[To the Limit (Joan Armatrading album)| ''To the Limit'']]. These albums included songs which continue to be staples of Armatrading's live shows, including "Willow", "[[Down to Zero]]", "Tall in the Saddle", and "Kissin' and a Huggin'". Also at this time Armatrading wrote and performed "The Flight of the Wild Geese", which was used during the opening- and end-titles of the 1978 war film ''[[The Wild Geese]]''.
The song was included on the soundtrack album for the film, originally released by A&M Records, later released under licence as a Cinephile DVD. A live album entitled [[Steppin' Out (Joan Armatrading album)| ''Steppin' Out'']] was released in 1979.

Between 1972 and 1976 Armatrading made a total of eight appearances in session for the John Peel show, and the decade saw her become the first [[Black British]] female singer-songwriter to enjoy international success.<ref name=npg/>

Armatrading appeared as the musical guest for Season 2, episode 21 of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which originally aired on 14 May 1977.<ref>

</ref>
She performed "Love and Affection" and "Down to Zero".

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1980 Armatrading revised her playing style and released ''[[Me Myself I]]'', a harder rock- and pop-oriented album produced by [[Richard Gottehrer]], who had previously produced albums for [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]. The album became Armatrading's highest ever charting album both in the UK and the US, while the [[Me Myself I (song)|title track]] became her second UK Top 40 hit single.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In that year, she performed on [[Rockpalast]] night.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockpalastarchiv.de/rn.html|title=Rockpalast Archiv|publisher=Rockpalast|language=de, en|access-date=3 November 2012}}</ref> The same pop style as on her previous album, now coupled with synthesisers, was also evident on the 1981 album ''[[Walk Under Ladders]]'' and 1983's ''[[The Key (Joan Armatrading album)|The Key]]''. All three of these albums were Top 10 successes in the UK, with ''The Key'' also producing the hit single "[[Drop the Pilot]]", Armatrading's third UK Top 40 hit single (UK #11).  To capitalise on her success, A&M released the [[greatest hits|best of]] [[compilation album]], ''Track Record'' in 1983.

Armatrading performed in 1985 at a sold-out concert at the Red Rocks Amphitheater in Denver, and another concert in Arizona with [[Cook da Books]].<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite book|title=Box Score Top Grossing Concerts|work=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT48|date=1 June 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|pages=48–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref> That year she released her next album, ''[[Secret Secrets]]''. The album was a top 20 hit but failed to yield any hit singles, cementing Armatrading's status as an "album artist". Taking over production responsibilities herself, she recorded the albums ''[[Sleight of Hand (Joan Armatrading album)|Sleight of Hand]]'' (1986), ''[[The Shouting Stage]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hearts and Flowers (album)|Hearts and Flowers]]'' (1990) for A&M Records, which all made the UK Top 40 but failed to achieve the level of commercial success of her earlier works despite successful national tours (a show from her 1988 "Shouting Stage" tour was also filmed for television).

In 1989 she was the guest of [[Sue Lawley]] on the [[BBC Radio 4]] radio programme ''[[Desert Island Discs]]'' where her favourite choice was [[Van Morrison]]'s "[[Madame George]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p009mf68|title=Joan Armatrading, Desert Island Discs – BBC Radio 4|website=BBC|access-date=11 May 2018}}</ref> Armatrading's full list included [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Gustav Mahler]].<ref>The full list was ''[[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto in E Minor]]'' by [[Felix Mendelssohn]], "[[That Old Black Magic]]" by [[Ella Fitzgerald]], "[[Madame George]]" by [[Van Morrison]], ''[[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Symphony No. 4 in G major]]'' by [[Gustav Mahler]], ''[[The Magnificent Seven]]'' theme by the [[Cincinnati Pops Orchestra]], "Dies irae" (from ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem Mass]]'') by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], "[[I'm a Man (Bo Diddley song)|I'm a Man]]" by [[Muddy Waters]] and ''[[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|Symphony No. 9 in E minor]]'' (from The New World) by [[Antonín Dvořák]].</ref> Her luxury item was a guitar, while her castaway's book was ''[[Why Didn't They Ask Evans?]]'' by [[Agatha Christie]].

In 1991 A&M released the compilation ''[[The Very Best of Joan Armatrading]]'' which returned her to the Top 10. However, her following studio album for A&M, 1992's ''[[Square the Circle (Joan Armatrading album)|Square the Circle]]'', did not replicate this success and would be her final recording for the label. Following her departure from A&M, a label she had been with for almost 20 years, Armatrading signed with [[RCA]] for her 1995 album ''[[What's Inside]]''. Despite various television appearances and a full tour (which included a [[string quartet]] in addition to her stage band), the album was not a commercial success, becoming her lowest charting studio album in 20 years. In December 1998, she released ''Lullabies with a Difference'', an album of lullabies contributed by her and several of her favourite artists, in honour of PACES, a charity for children with [[cerebral palsy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrmusic.com/artists/jaart.html|title=Joan Armatrading Artist Profile|publisher=Harmony Ridge Music|access-date=16 April 2013}}</ref>

===2000s onwards===
In 2003, no longer attached to a major label, she released the album ''[[Lovers Speak]]''. Though it was her first album in eight years, it met with little commercial success. In 2004, she released a live album, ''[[Live: All the Way from America]]'', which was a recording of a concert from her ''Lovers Speak'' tour.

Her 2007 album ''[[Into the Blues]]'' debuted at No. 1 on the US ''Billboard Blues Chart'', making Armatrading the first UK female artist to earn that distinction. ''Into the Blues'', which Armatrading called "the CD I've been promising myself to write for a long time", was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]], also making her the first female UK artist to be nominated in the Grammy Blues category.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}
 
In 2007 Armatrading appeared in Episode 3 of the second series of ''[[Live from Abbey Road]]'' performing "Tall in the Saddle" from her 1976 self-titled album, and "Woman in Love" from the album ''Into The Blues''. She also appeared on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' where she performed "Love and Affection", as well as "Woman in Love" and "My Baby's Gone" both from her 2007 ''Into The Blues'' album.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

In 2008 she was part of [[Cyndi Lauper]]'s [[True Colors Tour 2008]].

On 29 March 2010 she released a new album, ''[[This Charming Life]]''. The album peaked at No. 4 on the US [[Folk Albums|Billboard Folk Albums]] chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=joan armatrading|chart=Folk Albums}} Billboard.com (This Charming Life)]</ref> She embarked on an international tour to promote it, and a concert from this tour in April 2010 at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London was released on the CD/DVD album ''[[Live at the Royal Albert Hall (Joan Armatrading album)|Live at the Royal Albert Hall]]'', along with two tracks from a concert in [[Denver]], Colorado, US, in February 2011.<ref>{{allmusic|class=album|id=r2103996|tab=review|label=Review of ''Live at Royal Albert Hall''|first=Thom|last=Jurek|access-date=5 May 2011}}</ref> In 2012, she released the album ''[[Starlight (Joan Armatrading album)|Starlight]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Starlight-Joan-Armatrading/dp/B007AEX0LU|title=Starlight: Joan Armatrading|publisher=[[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]]|access-date=30 May 2012}}</ref>
