Soon after Horton opened the store, he met [[Ron Joyce]], a former Hamilton [[police constable]]. In 1965, Joyce took over the fledgling Tim Horton Donut Shop at 65 Ottawa St N. By 1967, after opening two additional stores, Joyce and Horton became full partners. Upon Horton's death, in an automobile crash in 1974, Joyce bought out the Horton family's shares for $1&nbsp;million and took over as sole owner of the existing chain of 40 stores, quickly and aggressively expanding the chain in both geography and product selection. The 500th store opened in 1991.<ref name="The Story of Tim Hortons">{{cite web

Ron Joyce's aggressive expansion of the Tim Hortons business resulted in major changes to the Canadian coffee and doughnut restaurant market. Many independent doughnut shops and small chains were driven out of business, while Canada's per-capita ratio of doughnut shops surpassed that of all other countries.<ref name="ind">{{Cite episode | title = The unofficial national sugary snack | network = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] | airdate = September 1, 1994 | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-69-1371-8375/life_society/canadian_food/clip8 | series = My Canada Includes Tourtière}}</ref>

The Horton and Joyce partnership carried on, with the marriage of Joyce's son, Ron Joyce Jr., and Horton's eldest daughter, Jeri-Lynn Horton-Joyce, who are joint owners of Tim Hortons franchises in [[Cobourg, Ontario]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saltzman |first1=Aaron |title=Multiple Tim Hortons franchises, other businesses cut pay, benefits, citing minimum wage hike |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tim-hortons-heirs-minimum-wage-wynne-ontario-1.4472878 |access-date=27 August 2019 |publisher=CBC News |date=January 5, 2018}}</ref>

Some older locations retain signage with the company's name including a possessive apostrophe, despite the fact that the official styling of the company's name has been ''Tim Hortons'', without an apostrophe, for at least a decade.<ref>{{cite news | last = Dickinson | first = Casey | title = Canadian Doughnut Shop Targets Upstate | work=CNY Business Journal | date = November 24, 2000 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_200011/ai_n8927439/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318230325/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3718/is_200011/ai_n8927439/|archive-date=18 March 2006}}</ref> The company had removed the apostrophe after signs using the apostrophe was interpreted by some to be breaking the [[Charter of the French Language#Commerce and business|language sign laws]] of the Province of Quebec in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.oqlf.gouv.qc.ca/ressources/bibliotheque/depliants/20130513_depliant5d.pdf | title=French language Commerce laws | website=oqlf |access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref> The removal of the apostrophe allowed the company to have one common sign image across Canada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wkyc.com/article/life/food/to-apostrophe-or-not-apostrophe-why-is-tim-hortons-not-tim-hortons/95-485466886|title=To apostrophe or not apostrophe?

Although a number of Quebec locations have bilingual menu boards, the decision to have both Canadian official languages represented is left to the discretion of individual franchise owners. Some Quebec locations have French-only menu boards. It is the strong recommendation to all the Quebec restaurants from the TDL Group Corporation that they post menu boards in both English and French in accordance with the standards being enforced by the ''[[Office québécois de la langue française]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://quebecitie.blogspot.com/2014/10/tim-hortons-bilingual-service-or-not.html|title=QuebeCitie: Tim Hortons: Bilingual signage?

====Merger with Wendy's====
[[File:MarkhamTimHortons3.jpg|thumb|right|A Tim Hortons/Wendy's joint restaurant in [[Markham, Ontario]]]]
In 1992, the owner of all Tim Hortons and [[Wendy's International, Inc.|Wendy's Restaurants]] in [[Prince Edward Island]], Daniel P. Murphy, decided to open new franchise outlets for both brands in the same building in the town of [[Montague, Prince Edward Island|Montague]]. Murphy invited Joyce and Wendy's chairman [[Dave Thomas (American businessman)|Dave Thomas]] to the grand opening of the "combo store", where the two executives met for the first time. Murphy's success with combining coffee and doughnuts with Wendy's fast food led to the August 8, 1995, acquisition of and [[merger]] with TDL Group by Wendy's International, Inc., an American company.<ref>{{Cite video | url = http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-1-73-2330-13539-10/on_this_day/politics_economy/twt |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | title = US burger giant buys Tim Hortons doughnut chain | date=August 10, 1995}}</ref> Joyce became the largest [[shareholder]] in Wendy's, even surpassing Thomas. TDL Group continued to operate as a separate subsidiary from its head office in [[Oakville, Ontario]], although Joyce eventually retired from active management to pursue other interests.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

The sale was widely commented on in the media.

In March 2010, Tim Hortons announced further expansion on both sides of the Canada–US border to be completed by 2013. The plan called for 600 new stores in Canada (primarily in Quebec and Western Canada but also including smaller communities) and 300 new stores in the US (primarily in its existing markets of Michigan, New York, and Ohio). It also called for expansion into such non-standard store locations as hospitals, universities, and airports, as well as extending its co-branding initiative with US ice cream chain [[Cold Stone Creamery]], which began in 2009, to cover 60 Canadian stores and 25–35 new and existing US stores. It also included testing a new café/bake shop concept in at least 10 existing US locations, including "enhanced finishes, fixtures, and seating areas" as well as an expansion of menu offerings.<ref>{{Cite press release | url = http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/about/news.html?c=195616&p=irol-news&nyo=0 | title = More than a Great Brand.

====United States====
Initially, the US stores were the result of natural expansion in Canada–U.S. border areas (e.g., stores in Maine and the [[Buffalo, New York]], area where Horton played from 1972 to 1974 as a member of the [[Buffalo Sabres]]). The first United States locations were opened in [[Deerfield Beach, Florida]], and [[Pompano Beach, Florida]], in 1981, but they proved unsuccessful and were closed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mullins|first=Paul R.|title=Glazed America: a history of the doughnut|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HtHgAAAAMAAJ&q=%22that+would+in+turn+spread+the+word+about+hortons%22|year=2008|page=115|isbn=9780813032382}}</ref>

In 1996 and 1997, thirty-seven former [[Rax Restaurants]] locations in Ohio, Kentucky, and West Virginia were bought by Wendy's International Inc.; 30 of these were converted to Tim Hortons, while the others became Wendy's franchise locations. Thirty-five closed [[Hardee's]] stores in the Detroit area were also purchased with the intention of being converted.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3190/is_n43_v30/ai_18851071 |title=Wendy's buys 37 Rax units, plans Tim Hortons makeover |access-date=December 8, 2009 |date=November 4, 1996 |work=Nation's Restaurant News}}</ref> By 2004, the chain had also acquired 42 [[Bess Eaton]] coffee and doughnut restaurants situated in southern New England.

On July 13, 2009, Tim Hortons opened stores in New York City at former [[Dunkin' Donuts]] locations operated by the Riese Organization.

The stores, which made less than half the average company per-store sales, were concentrated heavily in the [[Providence, Rhode Island]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut]], areas, the former of which also has a concentration of stores from the locally-competing [[Honey Dew Donuts]] chain, itself with some 150 outlets in [[Rhode Island]] and [[Southeastern Massachusetts]]. In the announcement, the chain stated that it will concentrate its efforts on its core markets such as western Canada. In the same statement, the company announced the sale of its portion of distribution company Maidstone Bakeries to Tim Hortons' European partners. It will use the {{CAD|400&nbsp;million}} generated by the sale for a [[share repurchase|stock buyback]].<ref name="Reuters-Mukhopadhyay">{{cite news |last=Mukhopadhyay |first=Bhaswati |title=Tim Hortons profit climbs; to close 36 US stores |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1022471120101111 |access-date=November 16, 2010 |date=November 11, 2010 |work=Reuters}}</ref>

In addition, Horton played for the Maple Leafs [[American Hockey League]] affiliate, the [[Pittsburgh Hornets]], earlier in his career as well as the Penguins for one season in 1971–72.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_699690.html |title=Tim Hortons makes its way to town |publisher=TribLIVE |date=September 16, 2010 |access-date=March 3, 2013}}</ref> [[Aramark]], which operated the kiosks, closed them in 2012, however Tim Hortons proceeded to open full-service locations in Pittsburgh and surrounding areas in July 2012. At the time of the entry into Pittsburgh, of the four NHL cities Horton played in (Buffalo, New York City, Toronto, and Pittsburgh), Pittsburgh was the only one without a Tim Hortons location, and was also where Horton met his future wife, Lori.

2011 saw Tim Hortons aggressively expanding into the [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/2011/10/tim_hortons_coffee_doughnut_sh.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140619214826/http://www.mlive.com/business/west-michigan/index.ssf/2011/10/tim_hortons_coffee_doughnut_sh.html|url-status=dead|title=Tim Hortons coffee, doughnut shop prepares to open several more West Michigan locations|first=Ron|last=Cammel|date=October 12, 2011|archive-date=June 19, 2014|website=mlive}}</ref>

Most of the time Tim Hortons' menu contains many of the same items across different locations.

Despite the chain's ubiquity across Canada, Tim Hortons has never offered [[poutine]] as a regular menu item, despite the fact that poutine (largely seen as Canada's [[signature dish]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://recipes.howstuffworks.com/poutine-canada.htm|title=Poutine Is Routine in Canada|date=April 29, 2019|website=HowStuffWorks}}</ref> is offered at just about every other major restaurant chain in Canada. Tim Hortons did offer poutine for the first time in 2018 across Canada for a limited time, using seasoned [[potato wedges]] instead of the typical [[french fries]]. Tim Hortons poutine received a mixed [[social media]] response.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jumpradio.ca/news/4276306/you-can-now-order-a-poutine-at-tim-hortons-locations-across-canada/|title=JUMP Radio}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/internet-ripping-tim-hortons-poutine|title = Canadians are ripping Tim Hortons' new poutine a new one &#124; Dished}}</ref>

In Canada, the company began to offer hamburgers on the lunch menu in 2017. In an attempt to lure customers with a more healthy option, Tim Hortons offered a hamburger filled with the "[[Beyond Meat]]" meatless option. The offering of hamburgers was risky for the company in their attempt to compete with the popular, large hamburger chains such as [[McDonald's]]. [[Wendy's]] and [[Burger King]] in Canada. Ironically, Burger King had acquired Tim Hortons in 2014 and was running it as a separate subsidiary, and had supply chain mechanisms already in place to supply Tim Hortons with hamburger items. However, after only a brief period, consumers did not respond well to Tim Hortons offering of hamburgers or the "Beyond Meat" variety. With poor national sales, subsequently in 2019, hamburgers were removed from the menus at the Canadian Tim Hortons stores.

====Baking methods and lawsuit====
Coupled with the expansion and the expanded menu came the outsourcing of baked goods. Doughnuts, which used to be made at night to be ready for the morning rush, are now [[parbaked]] – partly cooked and then frozen and delivered to every restaurant in Canada from [[Brantford]], Ontario.<ref name=faq /> Each restaurant bakes and finishes the product throughout the day. {{As of|2007|4}}, many of the various muffin batters were being revoked, as frozen, pre-made and pre-wrapped muffins were being introduced at Tim Hortons locations.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wendys-invest.com/timhortons.php | title = Our brands: Tim Hortons | publisher=Wendy's International | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080115134215/http://www.wendys-invest.com/timhortons.php | archive-date = January 15, 2008}}</ref>

Tim Hortons' switch to the [[parbaking]] system disappointed some customers, who noted that it contradicts the chain's "always fresh" slogan. David Swick reported in the ''[[Halifax Daily News]]'' on September 19, 2003, Tim Hortons outlets in [[Atlantic Canada]] would no longer serve fresh doughnuts, but rather doughnuts that had been remotely factory-fried and then frozen and shipped.<ref>{{cite news | first = David | last = Swick | title = Going from fresh to frozen | work = [[Halifax Daily News]] | date = September 17, 2003 | url = http://www.genx40.com/a/stuff/favoritereading/davidswick17 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120908141255/http://www.genx40.com/a/stuff/favoritereading/davidswick17 | archive-date = September 8, 2012 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> In 2008, two franchisees initiated a class-action lawsuit against the parent company for the switch to parbaking, "claiming breach of contract, breach of duty of fair dealing, negligent misrepresentation, and unjust enrichment".<ref name="classaction">{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=5292f806-bb77-4ca5-8e0c-2a24ee1cdc61|title=Tim Hortons sued by franchisees over frozen doughnuts|work=[[Financial Post]]|date=June 13, 2008|access-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020224258/http://www.canada.com/victoriatimescolonist/news/story.html?id=5292f806-bb77-4ca5-8e0c-2a24ee1cdc61|archive-date=October 20, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The lawsuit cited that parbaking tripled the franchisee's fixed cost to produce a doughnut (from 6 cents per doughnut to 18 cents),<ref name="tripled">{{cite news|url=http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=11fda198-50d0-4abe-8384-a14d31ebf12a|title=Tim Hortons par-baking cut into profits: lawsuit|last=Dobby|first=Christine|publisher=[[Calgary Herald]]/Financial Post|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=July 21, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929161957/http://www2.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=11fda198-50d0-4abe-8384-a14d31ebf12a|archive-date=September 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> required the purchase of new freezers and microwaves, and reduced profitability for the franchises while increasing profits for the parent company.<ref name="classaction" /> Franchise owners are required to purchase food products from the Brantford-based parbaking company owned by IAWS Group PLC,<ref name="tripled" /> and had originally been told the price of each doughnut would be 11 or 12 cents (and each Timbit 4.6 cents).<ref name="parprice">{{cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/2011/09/06/rolling-in-dough/|title=Tim Hortons: rolling in dough | author-link = Michael Friscolanti | last=Friscolanti|first=Michael|work=[[Maclean's]]|date=September 6, 2011|access-date=July 21, 2013}}</ref> The case was dismissed in February 2012.<ref name="dismissed">{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2012/02/28/tim-hortons-lawsuit/|title=Tim Hortons franchisees lose $2-billion doughnut lawsuit|last=Brean|first=Joseph|work=[[National Post]]|date=February 28, 2012|access-date=July 21, 2013}}</ref>

A 2009 ''[[New York Times]]'' article contrasted the baked from scratch at stores' approach of [[Krispy Kreme]] and some [[Dunkin' Donuts]] locations compared to the "flash frozen" and shipped Tim Hortons method. The ''Times'' article also noted an apparent scarcity of doughnut specialties such as the [[Dutchie (doughnut)|dutchie]] at newly opened Tim Hortons stores in [[New York City]]. Noting that "American visitors tend to flock to the sweets," including the "raisin-studded Dutchie", the ''Times'' found redemption among Canadians that the brand was once again a Canada-based company while contrasting the way politicians in the US "woo" [[soccer mom]]s while in Canada they "go after Tim Hortons voters".<ref>Ron Lieber [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/dining/15hort.html Tim Hortons Arrives in Bits and Pieces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215235111/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/15/dining/15hort.html |date=December 15, 2014 }} July 14, 2009, New York Times</ref>

In June 2015, Tim Hortons pulled a four-week advertising campaign by energy company [[Enbridge]] from its in-store "Tims TV" service after three weeks following a petition by the advocacy group, [[SumOfUs]]. Even though the ads were part of a general "Life Takes Energy" campaign introduced by Enbridge the previous year, the group argued that Tim Hortons' airing of the ads implied an endorsement of controversial projects under development by Enbridge, such as the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines|Northern Gateway pipeline]], going on to say that "Enbridge's ad campaign uses attractive actors, cute kids and high production values to hide the real truth—its tar sands project will put ecosystems, salmon and wildlife in danger, create virtually no local jobs, and accelerate climate change." The decision to pull the ads, however, resulted in a boycott of Tim Hortons led by [[Wildrose Party]] leader [[Brian Jean]], who felt that the decision was an attack on Alberta's oil industry, as Enbridge is one of the province's top-employing companies.<ref name="cbcnews-brianjean">{{cite web|title=Brian Jean, Wildrose leader, boycotts Tim Hortons after Enbridge ads pulled|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/brian-jean-wildrose-leader-boycotts-tim-hortons-after-enbridge-ads-pulled-1.3101820|publisher=CBC News|access-date=June 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="vice-timhortonsenbridge">{{cite web|title=Tim Hortons Stops Running Enbridge's Ads Following Public Backlash|url=https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/tim-hortons-enbridge-kill-their-ad-partnership-following-public-backlash-831|website=Vice News|access-date=June 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="cbc-timhortonsenrdige">{{cite web|title=Tim Hortons yanks Enbridge ads, sparks Alberta backlash|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/tim-hortons-yanks-enbridge-ads-sparks-alberta-backlash-1.3100676|publisher=CBC News|access-date=June 5, 2015}}</ref>

Some commentators have bemoaned the rise of Tim Hortons as a national symbol. Rudyard Griffiths, director of [[The Dominion Institute]], wrote in the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' in July 2006 that the ascension of the chain to the status of a cultural icon was a "worrying sign" for Canadian nationalism, adding, "Surely Canada can come up with a better moniker than the Timbit Nation."<ref name="griffiths">{{cite news | url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/31792939.html | title = Timbit Nation? |work=Winnipeg Free Press | date = August 15, 2006 | first = Rudyard | last = Griffiths}}</ref>

The parent company of [[Cold Stone Creamery]], Kahala, announced in February 2009 that it had reached an agreement with Tim Hortons to open up to 100 co-branded stores in the United States after successfully testing two locations in Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/article/583399 |title=Tim Hortons, Cold Stone to create new stores |work=Toronto Star |date=February 6, 2009 |agency=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The most notable co-branded store opened in August 2009 when Tim Hortons moved into three Cold Stone Creamery locations in New York City, including its flagship Times Square location.

In June 2009, Cold Stone Creamery started testing the Canadian market by opening its six co-branded locations with Tim Hortons in Ontario,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.amherstdaily.com/index.cfm?sid=260024&sc=498 |title=Tim Hortons to co-brand six stores in Ontario with Cold Stone Creamery |agency=[[The Canadian Press]] |work=Amherest Daily News |date=June 11, 2009 |access-date=September 15, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615081423/http://www.amherstdaily.com/index.cfm?sid=260024&sc=498 |archive-date=June 15, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> and began expanding its test markets in Canada, including Alberta, Nova Scotia, Ontario, New Brunswick, and British Columbia, and in the summer of 2010, Cold Stone Creamery moved into six Tim Hortons locations in Quebec and one in each of Charlottetown, and Summerside, PEI. However, in February 2014, Tim Hortons chief executive Marc Caira announced that they will be pulling Cold Stone Creamery from all its Canadian restaurants, although Tim Hortons would maintain its locations in the United States.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/business/tim-hortons-pulling-cold-stone-creamery-ice-cream-from-canadian-stores-1.1695303 |title=Tim Hortons to co-brand six stores in Ontario with Cold Stone Creamery |last=David Friend |first=David |date=February 20, 2014 |agency=The Canadian Press |publisher=CTV News |access-date=July 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign===
[[File:Tim-horton-lose.jpg|thumb|An example of a losing Roll Up the Rim to Win cup in 2007]]
Each February, Tim Hortons holds a marketing campaign called '''Roll Up the Rim to Win'''. As of 2007, over 31 million prizes were distributed each year,<ref name="Prizes">{{Cite press release|url=http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/about/news_archive_2007a.html|title=Rrroll Up The Rim To Win Is Back at Tim Hortons!|access-date=March 10, 2007|publisher=Tim Hortons|date=February 26, 2007|archive-date=February 12, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212215408/http://www.timhortons.com/ca/en/about/news_archive_2007a.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> including [[cars]], [[television]]s, and store products. Customers determine if they have won prizes by unrolling the rim on their paper cups when they have finished their drink, revealing the result underneath. Prizes are not distributed randomly country-wide; each of the company's distribution regions has distinct prize-winning odds.<ref name="rim1">{{cite news | title = Not all rims rrroll up equally |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation | date = March 15, 2006 | url = http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/03/15/timhortons-060315.html}}</ref> The idea for the campaign began in 1985 when Roger Wilson of one of Tim Hortons' supplier of cups, Lily Cup company, approached Tim Hortons with a new idea to increase their sales. Wilson explained his company had created a new cup design that allowed a message to be printed under the rim; the cup type cost no more than the current one and could enable a promotion or contest.<ref>{{cite news|last1=O'Reilly|first1=Terry|title=Small Move, Big Gain: An Encore Presentation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/undertheinfluence/small-move-big-gain-an-encore-presentation-1.3432927|access-date=February 18, 2017|agency=Pirate Radio|publisher=CBC Radio One|date=February 16, 2017}}</ref> Recognizing the opportunity to promote coffee in the normally weak sales period in the spring, the Roll Up the Rim to Win campaign was first held in 1986 when the biggest prize was a snack box of [[Timbits]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tim Hortons Roll Up The Rim 2012: 5 facts you should know about this iconic promotion |website=HuffPost |date=August 17, 2013 |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2012/02/22/tim-hortons-roll-up-the-rim-2012_n_1293654.html}}</ref> In 2008, over 88% of major prizes were redeemed.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/en/funfacts.php | title = RRRoll Up Fun: Fun Facts | work = RRRoll up the rim to win! | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090312141517/http://www.rolluptherimtowin.com/en/funfacts.php | archive-date = March 12, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

The contest is popular enough that Paul Kind has invented the Rimroller (as seen on ''[[Dragons' Den (Canada)|Dragons' Den]]''), a device for rolling up the rim mechanically.<ref name="rim2">{{cite news | url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/historic/32135644.html | title = Finally!

In honour of [[150th anniversary of Canada|Canada's sesquicentennial]], a special edition of the Roll Up the Rim promotion was held in July 2017, with prizes including an "Ultimate Canadian Vacation" valued at $10,000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/roll-up-the-rim-returns-tim-hortons-contest-back-for-canada-150-1.3479791|title='Roll Up The Rim' returns: Tim Hortons contest back for Canada 150|last=Dunham|first=Jackie|date=2017-06-28|website=CTVNews|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>

The contest has seen several controversies including the theft of unrolled cups.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.news.yahoo.com/history-tim-hortons-roll-rim-related-controversy-181515945.html|title=A history of Tim Hortons' Roll Up the Rim-related controversy|website=ca.news.yahoo.com}}</ref> In March 2006, two families were fighting over a [[Toyota RAV4]] [[Sport utility vehicle|SUV]] prize of {{CAD|32,000}} value when their daughters found a winning "roll up the rim" coffee cup in a garbage bin of an elementary school in [[Saint-Jérôme, Quebec|Saint-Jérôme]], a town north of [[Montreal]]. The younger girl had found a cup in the garbage bin and could not roll up the rim, so she requested the help of an older girl. Once the winning cup was revealed, the older girl's family stated that they deserved the prize. Tim Hortons originally stated that they would not intervene in the dispute. A further complication arose when Quebec lawyer Claude Archambault requested a [[Genetic fingerprinting|DNA test]] be done on the cup. He claimed that his unnamed client had thrown out the cup and was the rightful recipient of the prize.<ref name=cbc1>{{cite news|title=Lawyer wants DNA test on 'Roll up the Rim' cup|publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/03/10/hortons060310.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216085009/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/03/10/hortons060310.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 16, 2007|date=March 10, 2006}}</ref> On April 19, 2006, Tim Hortons announced that they had decided to award the prize to the younger girl who had initially found the cup.<ref name=cbc2>{{cite news|title=Finders, keepers: Tim Hortons puts a lid on cup contest controversy|work=CBC News|date=April 19, 2006|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2006/04/19/hortons-cup-060419.html}}</ref> The company has also faced concerns over the amount of additional litter generated by the promotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/roll-up-the-rim-environmental-concerns-1.5023903|title=Tim Hortons urged to green up its roll up the rim contest|work=CBC News|language=en|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>

In 2018, Tim Hortons began to add digital components to the promotion, via the "Scroll Up the Rim" feature (which gave players a chance at food prizes) on the chain's [[mobile app]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://mobilesyrup.com/2018/02/07/tim-hortons-roll-up-the-rim-to-win-mobile/|title=With Scroll Up To Win, Tim Hortons re-imagines Roll Up The Rim for the mobile age|date=2018-02-07|work=MobileSyrup|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}</ref>  In 2020, as part of environmental initiatives and to promote the chain's new Tims Rewards loyalty program, Tim Hortons announced that it would only distribute Roll Up the Rim cups during the first two weeks of the campaign. Each eligible purchase by a Tims Rewards member during the first half of the promotion was to earn two electronic entries, and one electronic entry in the second two weeks, redeemable via the Tims Rewards mobile app. Any purchase using a reusable cup was to award three entries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2020/02/18/tim-hortons-moves-toward-a-digital-roll-up-the-rim-contest.html|title=Tim Hortons moves toward a digital Roll Up the Rim contest|date=2020-02-18|website=Toronto Star|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/how-does-the-new-tim-hortons-roll-up-the-rim-contest-work-1.4818524|title=How does the new Tim Hortons' 'Roll Up The Rim' contest work?|last=Rodriguez|first=Jeremiah|date=2020-02-19|website=CTV News|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>

On March 7, 2020, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada|COVID-19 pandemic]], Tim Hortons announced that it had cancelled the distribution of physical cups for the promotion due to concerns that the virus could be spread by returned cups, and that the promotion would be conducted solely via the app. The chain had also joined others in temporarily prohibiting the use of reusable cups for similar reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2020/03/07/covid-19-prompts-tim-hortons-to-get-rid-of-roll-up-the-rim-paper-cups-before-iconic-annual-giveaway.html|title=Tim Hortons gets rid of Roll Up The Rim paper cups amid coronavirus outbreak|date=2020-03-07|website=Toronto Star|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref> The changes from 2020 remained in use for 2021, with the promotion therefore being renamed to '''Roll Up to Win'''.

==Controversies==
===Great White North Franchisee Association===
The Great White North Franchisee Association, which was formed in 2017, represented Tim Hortons franchises involved in a series of ongoing disputes with the head office of Tim Hortons due to frustrations with Restaurant Brands International (the parent company of Tim Hortons and Burger King). GWNFA has filed class-action lawsuits against the Restaurant Brands International over the handling of the Ontario minimum wage hike (see below), inflated head office pricing, and misuse of their advertising funds.<ref name="business.financialpost.com"/>

===Ontario minimum wage===
Tim Hortons became the subject of controversy after the raise of [[minimum wage]] in [[Ontario]] from $11.60 to $14.00 an hour which was made effective January 2018. The minimum wage increase was strongly criticized by the Ontario Chamber of Commerce, Restaurants Canada, and the Canadian Franchise Association. Restaurant Brands International did not help franchisees offset the wage hike, refusing to reduce the supply costs that it charged Tim Hortons franchisees, nor did it permit franchisees to raise menu prices in order to offset the wage hikes (in contrast to McDonald's, Cara Foods and Starbucks who did allow menu price increases in Ontario to cope with the wage increases).<ref name="business.financialpost.com">{{Cite web|url=https://business.financialpost.com/news/retail-marketing/we-are-offended-franchisees-blast-ontario-premier-for-unfairly-targeting-tim-hortons-founding-families|title='We are offended': Franchisees blast Ontario premier for unfairly targeting Tim Hortons' founding families &#124; Financial Post|date=January 5, 2018}}</ref> Tim Hortons franchisees, many of them small business owners who employed an average of 35 staff (the wage hike would cost the franchisee $7,000 per employee a year), responded by cutting employee benefits such as paid breaks and contributions to health plans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sagan|first1=Aleksandra|title=Children of Tim Hortons co-founders cut worker benefits at their franchises over wage hike|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/franchises-owned-by-children-of-tim-hortons-co-founders-reduce-employee-benefits/article37490649/|access-date=January 23, 2018|work=The Globe and Mail|date=January 4, 2018}}</ref> In one case, owners posted a memo encouraging employees to contact the Ontario Premier, [[Kathleen Wynne]], and indicate that they "will not vote Liberal in the coming Ontario election in June 2018."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=Sophia|title=Tim Hortons franchise owners tell workers to blame Wynne for benefit cuts and to 'not vote Liberal'|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/tim-hortons-minimum-wage-hike-ontario-government-1.4493436|access-date=January 23, 2018|publisher=CBC News|date=January 19, 2018|language=en}}</ref> Wynne responded by saying "I'm happy to talk to any business owner about the minimum wage but taking it out on employees is not fair and not acceptable."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Jeffords|first1=Shawn|title=Wynne criticizes Tim Hortons franchisees, says workers shouldn't be pawns|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/wynne-criticizes-tim-hortons-franchisee-says-workers-shouldnt-be-pawns/article37666259/|access-date=January 23, 2018|work=The Globe and Mail|date=January 19, 2018}}</ref> Around 50 demonstrations were held across Canada, including 38 in Ontario, in response to the benefit cuts.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hodges|first1=David|title=Tim Hortons protests to expand beyond Ontario, 50 demonstrations planned across Canada|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2018/01/18/tim-hortons-protests-to-expand-beyond-ontario-50-demonstrations-planned-across-canada.html|access-date=January 23, 2018|work=Toronto Star|date=January 18, 2018|language=en-CA}}</ref> The minimum wage controversy hurt the chain's reputation; usually placing in the top 10 of the Leger research poll for the top 10 companies or brands in Canada, Tim Hortons dropped from 4th place in 2017 to 50th in 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/business/article-tim-hortons-slides-from-top-10-in-brand-reputation-survey/|title=Tim Hortons slides from fourth to 50th in brand reputation survey|access-date=2018-04-06}}</ref>

===Plastics pollutant===
Named as one of the top five plastic polluters in Canada in 2018 and 2019; in 2019, Tim Hortons' accounted for "about 11%" of branded plastic waste uncovered by [[Greenpeace Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |title=These companies are the top 5 plastic polluters in Canada |url=https://dailyhive.com/vancouver/plastic-polluters-greenpeace-canada-2019 |publisher=Daily Hive |access-date=12 March 2020 |date=10 October 2019}}</ref>

In late 2018 and early 2019, Tim Hortons was subject to controversy over their usage of plastic cups. An online Change.org petition asking the company to switch from plastic cups to "a fully recyclable and compostable alternative" gained over 171,000 signatures. The cups are currently not compostable, due to their plastic lining, and are often very difficult to recycle. Tim Hortons has yet to respond to the petition's requests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/trio-of-calgary-kids-ask-canadian-coffee-chain-to-rethink-popular-contest|title=Trio of Calgary kids ask Canadian coffee chain to rethink popular contest {{!}} National Post|last=News|date=2019-02-04|language=en-CA|access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> In early 2020, they gave away reusable cups for their "Roll Up the Rim to Win" promotion, to eliminate single-use plastic in their establishments. The effort was criticized as [[greenwashing]] through a limited-time promotion.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-unbearable-hypocrisy-of-corporate-greenwashing/|title=Opinion: Tim Hortons's half-baked Roll Up The Rim changes are just another example of corporate greenwashing|access-date=2020-03-12}}</ref>

===2020 sick-leave during COVID-19 pandemic===
In March 2020, Tim Hortons met criticism for not offering sick-leave concessions to employees during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Canada]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Leavitt |first1=Kieran |title='I expect you to show up': Tim Hortons calls sick-leave note spotted in Alberta restaurant 'unfortunate' |url=https://www.toronto.com/news-story/9915385--i-expect-you-to-show-up-tim-hortons-calls-sick-leave-note-spotted-in-alberta-restaurant-unfortunate-/ |website=Toronto.com |access-date=28 March 2020 |date=25 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Mojtehedzadeh |first1=Sara |title=Tim Hortons responds to backlash over sick-leave policy amid COVID-19 outbreak |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2020/03/14/tim-hortons-responds-to-backlash-over-sick-leave-policy-amid-covid-19-outbreak.html |work=The Star |access-date=28 March 2020 |date=14 March 2020}}</ref>
