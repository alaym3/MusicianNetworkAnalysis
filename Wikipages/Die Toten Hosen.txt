'''Die Toten Hosen''' (literally "The Dead Trousers", figuratively "dead boring" referring to [[erectile dysfunction]]) is a German [[punk rock]] band from [[Düsseldorf]].

== History ==
The current members of Die Toten Hosen are [[Andreas Frege|Campino]] (Andreas Frege), Kuddel (Andreas von Holst), Vom (Stephen Ritchie), Andi (Andreas Meurer) and Breiti (Michael Breitkopf). All members except one are German, though Campino's mother, Jenny, was English. The drummer Vom comes from [[England]]. He joined in 1999, after previous drummer Wölli sustained injuries in a car crash. Wölli had played from 1985 to 1999 and was an honorary member of the band until his death in 2016. The drummer until 1985 was [[Trini Trimpop]], who became the band's manager when Wölli joined.

The band is reputed to have played for free at private birthday parties or similar events in their early years, so long as the host provided them with unlimited beer and covered all damage caused by the band.

=== 1982–1987 ===
Die Toten Hosen formed in 1982 at the Ratinger Hof, a [[Düsseldorf]] bar frequented by punk musicians. Its founder members were Campino and Andreas von Holst, both from local punk band ZK, with Andreas Meurer, Michael Breitkopf, Trini Trimpop and Walter November. According to their friend and one time promoter Andrea Berzen, they chose the name ''Die toten Hosen'' – which literally translates as "the dead trousers" but connotes the [[German language|German]] idiom "hier ist tote Hose" or "hier herrscht tote Hose" meaning "there is nothing going on here", "it’s boring here"<ref>It is also used to paraphrase impotence or lack of sexual activity, cf. [[:de:Tote Hose]]</ref> – over ''Die Pariser''.<ref>''Die Pariser'' translates as ''The Parisians'', Pariser also being a euphemism for condom in German</ref> According to Andrea Berzen, Campino preferred the former because it implied that their concerts might not be sold out, but there might be "tote Hose" on the nights.<ref>[http://www.dietotenhosen.de/band/freunde-des-hauses/andrea-berzen Andrea Berzen interview on ''dietotenhosen.de'']. Retrieved 19 October 2016.</ref>

At their first concert at the Bremer Schlachthof over Easter 1982, the [[Master of ceremonies|compère]] mistakenly introduced them as Die Toten H'''a'''sen (The Dead Hares).<ref>Bertram Job: ''Die Toten Hosen erzählen ihre Geschichte.'' page 70.</ref> The debut single ''[[Wir sind bereit]]'' (We are ready) was released in [[1982 in music|1982]], and was followed by their first album, ''[[Opel-Gang]]'', the next year.

Guitarist Walter November left the [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] in November 1983 due to his drug problems.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ich hab das alles im Herzen|url=http://www.taz.de/30-Jahre-Die-Toten-Hosen/!91182/|website=taz.de|access-date=15 April 2015}}</ref> One of the two A sides of the third single was the drinking song ''Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder'' (ice-cold Bommerlunder [[schnapps]]), which received considerable radio airplay and increased their fan base. The band released their first album titled ''[[Opel]]-Gang'' in early 1983 on their own label Totenkopf (skull).

In July 1983, the band signed to [[EMI]], who financed a video for ''[[Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder]]'', directed by Wolfgang Büld. It depicts a chaotic wedding ceremony in a small [[Bavarian church]], with [[Kurt Raab]] playing an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]] priest and [[Marianne Sägebrecht]] playing the bride. After the filming the congregation called for the church to be reconsecrated. German public television refused to screen the video for several years for fear of offending churchgoers.<ref name="Universa">Magazin zur Tour ''Menschen, Tiere, Sensationen'', Universa Medien Verlags GmbH, Dortmund 1992.</ref>

At the end of 1983, they released ''Hip Hop Bommi Bop'', a hip-hop version of ''Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder'' featuring New York rapper [[Fab Five Freddy]].<ref>[[Bertram Job]]: ''Bis zum bitteren Ende … Die Toten Hosen erzählen ihre Geschichte''. Kiepenheuer & Witsch, Köln 1996, {{ISBN|3-462-02532-5}}. page 91.</ref>

In 1984, the band played a session on the [[BBC]]'s [[John Peel|John Peel Show]]. EMI were displeased with the band's high travel costs and by Norbert Hähnel publicly parodying their million-selling artist [[Heino]] at a Toten Hosen concert. Heino successfully obtained a court order to cease and desist. Die Toten Hosen left EMI and signed to [[Virgin Records]]. Their second album ''Unter Falscher Flagge'' (Under False Colours), was released in 1984. The title explained the [[album cover|front cover]] of the LP, which carried a picture of the band members dressed as pirates aboard a ship. The original back cover featured the skeleton of a dog sitting in front of a gramophone, a caricature of the [[His Master's Voice]] artwork used by EMI. Legal action by EMI prompted the album cover to be changed to the skeleton of an eagle, which, along with the [[Jolly Roger]], became a band logo.

In Spring 1985, the band toured France for the [[Goethe-Institut|Goethe Institute]]<ref>[http://www.dietotenhosen.de/alldieganzenjahre_was_frueher_einmal_war_browser.php?contentid=25 Bericht aus dem Musik Express 8. Mai 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125051826/http://dietotenhosen.de/alldieganzenjahre_was_frueher_einmal_war_browser.php?contentid=25 |date=25 November 2010 }}</ref> and in Autumn they travelled to Hungary and Poland. In late 1985, Trini Trimpop moved from drumming for the band into their management, where he worked until 1992. Jakob Keusen briefly replaced him as the band's drummer before Wolfgang Rohde (Wölli) took over in January 1986. Rohde’s first concert was also the band’s first concert in front of a very large audience. Along with [[Herbert Grönemeyer]], [[Udo Lindenberg]], [[Marius Müller-Westernhagen]], [[Bap (German band)|BAP]], the Rodgau Monotones and many others, they performed at the [[Anti-WAAhnsinns-Festival]] in July 1986 to protest the construction of the nearby [[Nuclear reprocessing plant Wackersdorf]].

In 1986, they recorded their third album, ''[[Damenwahl]]'' (Ladies' Choice). The Damenwahl tour was sponsored by the northern German condom manufacturer Fromms, who arranged for free samples to be scattered amongst the crowd.<ref>Bertram Job: ''Die Toten Hosen erzählen ihre Geschichte.'' page 160.</ref> In 1987, the band celebrated its first chart success with the record ''[[Never Mind the Hosen, Here's Die Roten Rosen]]'' (Never mind the Trousers – Here’s the Red Roses) using the pseudonym Die Roten Rosen (The Red Roses). The album contains rock versions of German 1960s pop songs. The name and cover art of the record are a parody of the LP [[Never Mind the Bollocks, Here’s the Sex Pistols]] by the [[Sex Pistols]] from 1977.

In late 1987, Die Toten Hosen released their first live album ''[[Bis zum bitteren Ende]]'' (Till the Bitter End). It charted in the German and Austrian Top 30.

=== 1988 to 1995: Recognition and early success ===
In 1988, the band released their commercial breakthrough, the album ''[[Ein kleines bisschen Horrorschau]]'' (A little bit of horrorshow). The album referenced the [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film of the same name]] and was largely written for Bernd Schadewald’s theatre adaption of ''A Clockwork Orange''. For half a year the band played on stage at the Kammerspiele Bad Godesberg theatre in Bonn, alongside Ralf Richter, the play's lead actor. In September 1988, Die Toten Hosen performed at the [[Lituanika Festival]] in [[Vilnius]] and [[Kaunas]], Lithuania. They were chosen by the jury as the best band of the event.<ref>[[Metal Hammer]], Ausgabe 11/1988, page 122.</ref> The album included ''[[Hier kommt Alex]]'' (Here comes Alex) was later re-recorded in an unplugged version in 2005 incorporating the opening piano phrase of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Moonlight Sonata]].

Their spring tour in 1989 included a sell-out performance at the huge [[Westfalenhallen]] in [[Dortmund]]. The band released ''3 Akkorde für ein Halleluja'' (3 Chords for a Hallelujah), a video documentary of their lives. In 1990 the Toten Hosen were invited to attend the [[New Music Seminar]] in New York<ref>[[Jürgen Seibold]], V.I.P. music: ''Die Toten Hosen''. [[Paul Zsolnay Verlag]], Wien 1992, {{ISBN|3-552-05005-1}}. page 56.</ref> and performed as support for [[The Rolling Stones]] in Cologne. That summer the band travelled to Italy to report on the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]] for various newspapers and radio stations.<ref>[http://www.dietotenhosen.de/alldieganzenjahre_was_frueher_einmal_war_teil3.php taz, Ausgabe 11–30/Juni 1990 u. 2–8/Juli 1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321103544/http://www.dietotenhosen.de/alldieganzenjahre_was_frueher_einmal_war_teil3.php |date=21 March 2012 }}</ref> For this purpose they recorded a rock cover version of the classic ''[[Azzurro]]'' by [[Adriano Celentano]], accompanied by a video satirising the behaviour of German football fans when abroad. The double album ''Kreuzzug ins Glück'' (Crusade to happiness) was released in 1990 and sold over 150,000 copies in its first week.<ref>[http://www.dietotenhosen.de/alldieganzenjahre_was_frueher_einmal_war_browser.php?contentid=63 Frankfurter Rundschau 1990] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623124344/http://dietotenhosen.de/alldieganzenjahre_was_frueher_einmal_war_browser.php?contentid=63 |date=23 June 2011 }}</ref>

In 1991 the Toten Hosen released their album ''Learning English Lesson One'', a tribute to the band's musical influences, consisting mainly of cover versions of English punk rock classics. Each track featured at least one member of the original band that had recorded it. Several songs were recorded in Rio de Janeiro with [[Great Train Robbery (1963)|Great Train Robber]] [[Ronald Biggs]]. The album also marked the beginning of the band's collaboration with [[T.V. Smith]], songwriter and lead singer of [[The Adverts]], which continues to the present day.

The band's 1992 ''Menschen, Tiere, Sensationen'' (People, Animals, Sensations) tour included concerts in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Denmark, Great Britain, Spain, France and a their first ever dates in Argentina.<ref>Bertram Job: ''Bis zum bitteren Ende … Die Toten Hosen erzählen ihre Geschichte''. Kiepenheuer & Witsch, Köln 1996, {{ISBN|3-462-02532-5}}. page 264.</ref>
The single ''Sascha … ein aufrechter Deutscher'' (Sascha... an upstanding German) was released for Christmas 1992 as a vehement condemnation of right-wing radicalism. The proceeds of this song were donated to an anti-racist charity campaign in Düsseldorf. The right-wing Republikaner party failed in its attempt to have the song banned for defamation and thereby unintentionally contributed to the success of the single. The song grossed half a million Deutsche Mark.<ref>[[Zillo]], Ausgabe Mai 1993.</ref>

In 1993, the album ''Kauf MICH!'' (Buy ME!) was released and reached number one in the German charts. Its songs express opinions on consumerism, advertisement and right-wing extremism. In the summer of 1993 Die Toten Hosen performed as the supporting act for U2 on their Zoo TV tour in Germany, with audiences of over 50,000 people at each concert. The video to the song ''Kauf MICH!'' shows footage of these concerts.<ref>DVD ''Reich & sexy II'', Kommentare der Band.</ref> In the same year, the band released [[Reich & Sexy]] (Rich & Sexy), their first best-of album. On the cover the members of the band are naked, portraying pretentious millionaires from the music industry surrounded by nude women. An international version of the best-of album was released in 1994 called ''Love, Peace & Money''. For a period, Die Toten Hosen had three albums in the German charts at the same time.

In 1994 the band was on the road for almost the entire year in Germany and neighbouring countries. In November they gave four concerts in the US and in Canada as support act for [[Green Day]]. Starting in April 1995, the Toten Hosen got their own radio program on Fritz radio in Berlin, called ''Tausend Takte Tanzmusik'' ("a thousand beats of dance music"). The show aired every Sunday from 7 to 8 pm for a year.<ref>Kai Jessen: ''Die Toten Hosen – Für immer Punk!'' [[Heyne-Verlag|Wilhelm Heyne Verlag]], München 1997, {{ISBN|3-453-12889-3}}, page 97.</ref> At the end of the year the band founded their own record label JKP.

=== 1996 to 2020: JKP – the beginnings with their own label ===
The first album under their own label was ''Opium fürs Volk'' (opium for the people), released in 1996. Its songs deal with faith and religion. The album went platinum, their third record to do so, after ''Kauf MICH!'' and ''Reich und sexy''.<ref name="Gold">{{cite web|url=http://www.musikindustrie.de/gold_platin_datenbank/#topSearch|title=BVMI – Datenbank|first=Bundesverband|last=Musikindustrie}}</ref> The single "Zehn kleine Jägermeister" (ten little master huntsmen or rather: ten little [[Jägermeister]]s) went to number one of the German-speaking singles charts. Die Toten Hosen and [[Iggy Pop]] were a supporting act at the [[Ramones]] farewell concert in the [[Estadio Monumental Antonio Vespucio Liberti|River-Plate-Stadion]] of [[Buenos Aires]] in front of 75,000 people. An extended tour followed under the slogan "Ewig währt am längsten" (Eternity lasts longest) through Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Furthermore, they performed at the Gurtenfestival, the Forestglade Festival, the Berlin [[Waldbühne]] and at the Bizarre Festival in Cologne. In May 1996 they headlined the [[Rock am Ring]] festival. In the same year the band released their second live album ''Im Auftrag des Herrn'' (on the Lord's behalf).

Their 1000th concert was on 28 June 1997 in the Düsseldorfer Rheinstadium, and was attended by over 60,000 fans. The death of Dutch girl Rieke Lax at the concert prompted the band to release the song "Alles ist eins" (Everything is one) in her memory.

The 1998 [[Warped Tour]] took in [[New Zealand]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]] and [[Hawaii]]. Campino was twice hospitalised after concerts in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]] and [[Geelong]] in Australia.

Die Toten Hosen have collaborated with numerous other musicians (like [[Bad Religion]], [[AC/DC]], [[U2]], [[Rolling Stones]]); they are also one of the few German punk bands popular outside Germany, with a large following in [[South America]], [[Australia]] and [[Eastern Europe]].

The band's members are passionate fans of their local football team, [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]], which they sponsored from 2001 to 2003.  When a goal is scored at the club's ground, the [[Esprit Arena]], the chorus of the band's song "Strom" is played. The band released a football-themed song named "[[Bayern (song)|Bayern]]" in 2000 in which they proclaim that they would not join [[Bayern Munich]] under any circumstances. Campino mentioned that the band lost significant CD sales in the southern Germany since the release of the song.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bundesliga - Bitterböse Glückwünsche an Hoeneß|url=http://de.eurosport.yahoo.com/05012012/73/bundesliga-bitterboese-glueckwuensche-hoeness.html|access-date=29 August 2013|newspaper=Yahoo Sport Deutschland|date=5 January 2012}}</ref>

In August 2006, Campino starred as [[Mack the Knife]] in [[Bertolt Brecht|Brecht's]] ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' at Berlin's [[Admiralspalast]], a short distance from the theatre where the play premiered in 1928. The director, famous actor [[Klaus Maria Brandauer]], was criticised for the play's unadventurous staging, but Campino was cheered by the audience.

Artist [[Andreas Gursky]] produced ''Tote Hosen'', a blown up photograph of the crowd from a Die Toten Hosen concert, depicting youths excitedly cheering for the band, many wearing the red Hosen shirt. It is in the collection of the [[Museum of Modern Art]].

[[Faith No More]] bassist [[Billy Gould]] wore a Toten Hosen tee shirt on the cover of their greatest hits album, ''[[Midlife Crisis: The Very Best of Faith No More]]''. Faith No More have covered the Toten Hosen song ''Hofgarten'' in live shows.

German rock group [[Samsas Traum]] covered "Hier kommt Alex" with a more gothic sound. Lead singer Alexander Kaschte changes the final lyric to "Hey! Ich bin Alex!" (Hey! I am Alex!) as a wry joke. British punk band [[UK Subs]] recorded an English-language cover of the song on their 1993 album ''Normal Service Resumed''. '"Hier kommt Alex" is featured in video games ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]'' and ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' (European version).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=184936|title=GamesRadar+}}</ref> The song was also released as a downloadable track on the American version of Rock Band on 27 May 2008.<ref name="rb-europe-dlc">{{cite web | url = http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/864/864831p1.html | title = EU Rock Band Priced and Dated | access-date = 8 April 2008}}</ref> Die Toten Hosen also have a special edition of [[SingStar]] for PlayStation 2, devoted exclusively to the band, featuring 24 tracks and videos from over the decades, which was released in 2007.

[[MC Frontalot]], in collaboration with faux-German electronic musician [[Kompressor (musician)|KOMPRESSOR]] on the track ''Rappers We Crush'', rhymes "What did I do to deserve this?/What was my crime?/Was it because I sampled Die Toten Hosen that one time?"

In 2002 and 2005, the band played at [[Przystanek Woodstock]], the biggest open air festival in Europe.  In 2010, the band played several dates in [[Central Asia]] and became the first foreign rock band to perform in the former Soviet republic of [[Tajikistan]] since 1991. The band was criticised for accepting 68,000 € of German government funding towards this tour.<ref>{{cite web | author=Lucas Wiegelmann | url=http://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/article1784891/68-793-Euro-Steuergeld-fuer-die-Toten-Hosen.html | title=68.793 Euro Steuergeld für die Toten Hosen | work=Berliner Morgenpost | date=6 October 2011}}</ref> On 2 October 2010, the band played in Amman, Jordan, their first concert in the Middle East.

In 2012, Die Toten Hosen released their album ''[[Ballast der Republik]]''. A special edition includes a bonus CD with cover versions of songs that influenced the band. On 26 April 2016 it was announced that former drummer Wolfgang Rohde had died of cancer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rp-online.de/kultur/musik/wolfgang-woelli-rohde-ehemaliger-drummer-der-toten-hosen-gestorben-aid-1.5933043|title=Krebs: Ehemaliger Hosen-Drummer Wolfgang 'Wölli' Rohde ist tot|last=ONLINE|first=RP|website=RP ONLINE|access-date=26 April 2016}}</ref>

In early 2018, Members of Die Toten Hosen recorded backing vocals on Australian band [[The Living End]]'s eighth studio album [[Wunderbar (The Living End album)|Wunderbar]], which was recorded in Germany.

On November 27, 2020, the single "You're No Good" dropped online.

== Musical style ==

All band members are self-taught musicians. At the beginning of their musical career most of them were still at school. Their first album was recorded in a studio rented by the hour.<ref>Booklet zur Neuauflage von ''[[Opel-Gang]]'', 2007.</ref> The band kept to simple guitar chords and lyrics, in garage style. ''Die Toten Hosen'' were mainly influenced by punk bands from the 1970s, to whom they frequently pay tribute in recorded work and live performances. On occasion they have played songs by the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. Some of the band's songs have been described as "Schunkelpunk", a fusion of German [[schlager music]] and punk, exemplified by ''Eisgekühlter Bommerlunder'', numerous cover versions of German schlager songs and tracks like ''Azzurro''. They can be seen as pioneers of "Volxmusic",<ref>Jürgen Seibold, V.I.P. music: ''Die Toten Hosen''. Paul Zsolnay Verlag, Wien 1992, {{ISBN|3-552-05005-1}}. page 24.</ref> which combines elements of German folk music with jazz, hip-hop or rock. In some of their songs ''Die Toten Hosen'' experiment with strings or wind instruments. A few songs have elements that are lifted from [[jazz]] (e.g. ''Warum werde ich nicht satt''), [[reggae]] (''Zehn kleine Jägermeister'') or Yugoslavian gypsy music (''Das Mädchen aus Rottweil'').

For the most part, The Toten Hosen have not departed substantially from their original style of music, choosing [[power chords]],<ref>[http://www.radioeins.de/programm/sendungen/eins_am_abend/musikanalyse/hier_kommt_alex_von.html Gespräch mit Prof. Fladt bei RBB]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> straightforward lyrics, simple melodies and anthem-like choruses over long instrumental solos.  Other influences on the music of Die Toten Hosen include hardcore punk, punk blues, heavy metal, thrash metal, and hard rock.

The focus of the band's music has gradually shifted from funny and nonsensical to serious.  The songs from the band's first [[gramophone record|LP]] were mostly about having fun, but by the end of the 1980s they were focusing more on political and social issues such as [[racism]].

== Social involvement ==

=== Political activities ===
The band openly support political and social organizations in their music, interviews and by donations, but are not affiliated with any political party. They turned down a request from Germany's [[SPD]] (Social Democratic Party) to write a song for their European election campaign in 1994.<ref>Bertram Job: ''Die Toten Hosen erzählen ihre Geschichte'', page 182.</ref>

In 1991, their track ''Fünf vor Zwölf'' (it is high time) was published on the sampler ''Nazis raus'' (Nazis get out) and in 2006 they supported the band ZSK's ''Kein Bock auf Nazis'' (can't stand Nazis) campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.keinbockaufnazis.de/|title=Kein Bock Auf Nazis}}</ref> In 1992, the band participated in a demonstration against [[xenophobia]] in Bonn. They performed together with [[Herbert Grönemeyer]], [[Nina Hagen]] and others for nearly 200,000 demonstrators. In 1995 they supported [[Greenpeace]], [[International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War|IPPNW]], ''Aktion Atomteststop'' (an initiative for a nuclear test ban), the [[Bund für Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland|BUND]] (German ''Friends of the Earth'' chapter) and they were featured on the track ''Tout Pour Sauver L’Amour'' (Everything to save love) on the ''Stop Chirac'' compilation album.<ref>''Stop Chirac'', RCA 74321 32091 2.</ref>

In 2002, the band attracted publicity by posing undressed for posters of the animal rights group [[PETA]] under the slogan ''Lieber nackt als im Pelz'' (Better naked than in fur).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://de.sevenload.com/bilder/iZd7TVs-Lieber-nackt-als-im-Pelz|title=PETA poster at sevenload|access-date=11 December 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213211641/http://de.sevenload.com/bilder/iZd7TVs-Lieber-nackt-als-im-Pelz|archive-date=13 December 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> in 2005 they funded 'On the Run', a compilation album to raise funds for immigrants' rights organisation [[Pro Asyl]], and contributed the song ''Meine Stadt'' (my town).<ref>Pro Asyl: ''On the Run'', JKP, 2005, 57162.</ref>

From 1999 to 2004 their web site had a public discussion forum but this was terminated without explanation.

=== Ties to Düsseldorf ===
Over the course of the band's history, Die Toten Hosen have expressed their loyalty to their home town in various ways. In summer 1995, the band staged an ice hockey game called ''Powerplay des Wahnsinns'' (Power-play of insanity), playing in a team alongside professional players from Düsseldorfer EG against a team composed of Finnish rock band [[Leningrad Cowboys]] and Finnish national ice hockey players. The match took place in the stadium at the Brehmstrasse in Düsseldorf. Their team ''Knochenbrecher Düsseldorf'' (Düsseldorf Bonebreakers) lost 9:10. In 1996 they slipped into women's clothing, silk stockings and high heels and took part in the Düsseldorf Mardi Gras parade with their own float under the slogan "We bury good taste".

Die Toten Hosen are supporters of the football club [[Fortuna Düsseldorf]]. At the end of the 1980s, they helped the club by donating 200,000 DM towards signing the player [[Anthony Baffoe]] .<ref>Jürgen Seibold, V.I.P. music: ''Die Toten Hosen''.
