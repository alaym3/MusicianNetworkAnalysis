'''Stealers Wheel''' were a Scottish [[folk rock]]/[[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1972 in [[Paisley (Scotland)|Paisley]], Scotland, by former school friends [[Joe Egan (musician)|Joe Egan]] and [[Gerry Rafferty]].<ref name="allmusic-stealerswheel">{{cite news |url={{AllMusic |class=artist |id=p20739 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Stealers Wheel Biography |last=Eder |first=Bruce |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> Their best-known hit is "[[Stuck in the Middle with You]]". The band broke up in 1975 and re-formed briefly in 2008.

==Biography==
Egan and Rafferty met as teenagers in Paisley, and became the core of Stealers Wheel. They were initially joined by Roger Brown, [[Rab Noakes]] and Ian Campbell in 1972. By the time the band was signed to [[A&M Records]] later that year, Brown, Noakes and Campbell had been replaced by Paul Pilnick, [[Tony Williams (English musician)|Tony Williams]] and [[Rod Coombes]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=1132/3}}</ref>

The original line-up recorded ''[[Stealers Wheel (album)|Stealers Wheel]]'' (October 1972), produced by American songwriters and producers [[Leiber & Stoller]],<ref name="Larkin"/> and was a critical and commercial success, reaching No. 50 in the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album [[record chart|chart]], with their hit single "Stuck in the Middle with You" coming from the album.<ref name="allmusic-stealerswheel"/> On 7 November 1972 the band appeared on [[BBC 2]]'s ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]]'', performing "I Get By" and "Late Again".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sites.google.com/site/vintagerocktv/uk/old-grey-whistle-test |title=''Old Grey Whistle Test'' - Vintage Rock TV Archive |website=sites.google.com |access-date=24 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27026o9pQag |title=Stealers Wheel - 'I Get By' |date=1 March 2009 |access-date=24 October 2017 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evmsWcFX3Ao|title=Late Again (Stealers Wheel) |date=6 May 2011 |access-date=24 October 2017 |publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

By the time the first album was released, Rafferty had left the band; [[Luther Grosvenor]] filled in for him on tour.<ref name="Larkin"/> Tony Williams also left shortly afterwards, and DeLisle Harper joined on bass for the tour.

"Stuck in the Middle With You" reached No. 6 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 8 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> in 1973, selling over one million copies worldwide, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book |first=Joseph |last=Murrells |year=1978 |title=The Book of Golden Discs |edition=2nd |publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/337 337] |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/337 }}</ref> With the album also selling well, Rafferty was persuaded to return. However, Grosvenor, Coombes, Pilnick, and Harper all left the band. The band officially became a duo with various backing musicians on guitar, bass, and drums.<ref name="Larkin"/> Later in 1973, the single "Everyone's Agreed That Everything Will Turn Out Fine" had modest chart success, and in 1974, the single "[[Star (Stealers Wheel song)|Star]]" reached the Top 30 of both the UK and US charts.<ref name="allmusic-stealerswheel"/><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Reviewing the single "Star", David Middleton at PopRockNation wrote:
<blockquote>A catchy shuffle of the Lennonesque variety, 'Star' is 3 minutes of pure shimmering acoustic-guitar pop loveliness and honey-throated vocal harmonies, punctuated with spikes of harmonica, kazoo, woodblock, and bawdy barrelhouse piano.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://poprocknation.com/forty-five-revolutions-per-minute-18-born-sippy/ |title=Forty-Five Revolutions per Minute #18: Born Sippy |first=David |last=Middleton |website=Poprocknation.com |access-date= 17 January 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

A second album, ''[[Ferguslie Park (album)|Ferguslie Park]]'', was released in 1973,<ref name="Larkin"/> the duo supported by nine musicians.<ref name="allmusic-fergusliepark">{{cite news |url={{AllMusic |class=album |id=r50138 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Ferguslie Park Stealers Wheel review |last=Eder |first=Bruce |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref> The album, named after [[Ferguslie Park|an area of Paisley]], just reached the US ''Billboard'' 200 and was a commercial failure. With increasing tensions between Egan and Rafferty, and with Leiber & Stoller also having business problems, Stealers Wheel broke up.<ref name="Larkin"/> By the time the album ''Right Or Wrong'' was released in 1975, they had already disbanded.<ref name="allmusic-stealerswheel"/> Because of disagreements and managerial problems, it was produced by [[Mentor Williams]]. In 1978, A&M released the compilation album ''Gerry Rafferty And Joe Egan — Stuck In The Middle With You (The Best Of Stealers Wheel)''.

Another compilation album, ''Best of Stealers Wheel'', was released in 1990. In 1992, director [[Quentin Tarantino]] used the track "Stuck in the Middle with You" on the soundtrack of his debut film ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]''.<ref name="allmusic-stealerswheel"/> A dance version of "Stuck in the Middle with You" was a UK Top 10 hit for [[Louise Redknapp|Louise]] in September 2001, with a music video that drew heavily on the original song's appearance in ''Reservoir Dogs''.

All three albums had been unavailable for many years, though in 2004 and 2005 the British [[independent record label]] Lemon Recordings, of [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]], re-released them, albeit copied from vinyl.

After being contacted by [[iTunes]] and [[K-tel]] in California, Tony Williams briefly re-formed Stealers Wheel in [[Blackpool]] in 2008 with Rod Coombes and Paul Pilnick, together with close friend Tony Mitchell. On 10 November 2008, they started filming a music video for a re-recording of "Stuck in the Middle" on the [[The Fylde|Fylde coast]]. They also began writing new songs although they had no plans to tour, and disbanded again.<ref name="gazette4690558">{{cite news |url=http://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/blackpoolnews/Blackpool-Councillor-follows-Take-That39s.4680558.jp |title=Blackpool Councillor follows Take That's lead |last=Parkinson |first=Shelagh |date=11 November 2008 |newspaper=[[Blackpool Gazette]]|access-date=11 November 2008}}</ref>

In early 2016, independent record label Intervention Records reissued both ''[[Stealers Wheel (album)|Stealers Wheel]]'' and ''[[Ferguslie Park (album)|Ferguslie Park]]'' on 180-gram vinyl.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.interventionrecords.com/records/steelers-wheel-self-titled/ |title=Stealers Wheel 180G LP |website=Interventionrecords.com |access-date=2018-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.interventionrecords.com/records/ferguslie-park/ |title=Ferguslie Park 180G LP |website=Interventionrecords.com |access-date=2018-06-17 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>
