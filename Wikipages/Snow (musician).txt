'''Darrin Kenneth O'Brien''' (born October 30, 1969), known by his stage name '''Snow''', is a Canadian [[reggae]] musician, rapper and singer. His 1992 single "[[Informer (song)|Informer]]" spent seven weeks at No. 1 on the US [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="Billboard">''Billboard'' [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p26072|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic.com] (Retrieved March 3, 2010)</ref>

==Early life==
Snow was born and raised in the [[North York]] district of [[Toronto]], Ontario.<ref name="early background">Snow's early background is provided by Snow in 12 Inches of Snow, VHS (New York: A-Vision, 1993); SNOW, DVD, (Toronto: EMI Virgin Canada, 2003); and testimony from O'Brien, M.C. Shan and Prince is taken from Prince V. O'Brien, see: https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13886394386652351580&q=Prince+v.+O%27BRIEN,+256+AD2d+208&hl=en&as_sdt=100000000000002&as_vis=1 For further biographical information, see Dennis Hunt, "A Hot Reggae Artist Named Snow," Los Angeles Times, March 25, 1993, 10C; Mary Talbot with Jennifer Boeth, "A Blizzard Headed Our Way," Newsweek, March 29, 1993, 47; and Anne Trebbe, "Hard Core Jamaican Style Rap is Snow's Business," USA Today, April 1, 1993, 3d.</ref> For much of his childhood, he lived in the Allenbury Gardens public housing project, and at the age of 17 he moved to [[Ajax, Ontario]]. Growing up in a diverse neighbourhood, O'Brien blended dancehall and reggae with rock and popular music to create his own unique style of music. In 1988, Jamaican-born DJ Marvin Prince witnessed O'Brien [[Deejay (Jamaican)|deejaying]] at a party and the two quickly became friends. For the next few years, they practiced in Prince's basement with Snow providing vocals and Prince [[Turntablism|playing records]]. 

== Career ==
While on a trip to New York City, Prince mentioned Snow to rap star [[M.C. Shan]]. Shan then invited Snow to New York and introduced him to music producers, David Eng and Steve Salem. Snow eventually signed a contract to record on their Motorjam/[[Elektra Records|Elektra]] record label and in 1993 released his debut album ''[[12 Inches of Snow]]''.<ref name="early background" />

While Snow served prison time for an attempted murder charge, M.C. Shan, David Eng, Steve Salem, and Marvin Prince promoted the recordings.<ref name="early background"/>
Upon his release from prison, Snow's first single "[[Informer (song)|Informer]]", written by Snow, M.C. Shan, and Edmond Leary,<ref>According to the official credits, Darrin O'Brien, M.C. Shan, and Edmond Leary officially wrote Informer. See ''12 Inches of Snow'', CD (New York: East-West Records, 1993). Years later, after Snow and Prince had their falling out, Prince unsuccessfully sued Snow for compensation. See Betsey Powell, "Snow Vindicated: Court Overturns 1.5 Million Judgement," ''Toronto Star'', January 21, 1999, 1.</ref> became a [[Chart-topper|chart-topping]] hit. The album sold over 8 million records worldwide, with the "Informer" single remaining number 1 on the American ''Billboard'' charts for seven consecutive weeks. "Informer" has been recorded twice in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' as the best selling reggae single in US history, as well as the highest charting reggae single in history. A second single, "Girl I've Been Hurt", reached Number 19 on the Hot 100.<ref>For the Guinness Book of World Records, see: Mark Young and Chris McWhirter, ''The Guinness Book of Records 1999''(Guinness Records, 1998), 236–37.  See Mike Ross, "Snow Alert," ''Jam'', October 14, 2000.  Available Online at: http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Snow/2000/10/14/749728.html. Accessed September 14, 2010. For a synopsis of the success of Informer see http://www.artistdirect.com/artist/bio/snow/495020</ref>  In Japan, Snow received the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]'s 1994 Gold Disc Award for Best New Artist.<ref>See: RIAJ Certification Awards, www.riaj.or.jp/data/others/gdlist/pdf/gd1-20_list.pdf (Accessed November 3, 2010).</ref>

=== Origin of stage name===
As the government of Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] continued reforming immigration policies, instituting social reforms, and promoting multiculturalism in Canada, a larger influx of Jamaicans immigrated into the [[Greater Toronto Area]].<ref>For a brief overview of Jamaican immigration and identity, see: T. A. Jones, "Race, Place, and Social Mobility of Jamaicans in Toronto," in Frazier, John W., ed. and Edward, Joe T. ''The African Diaspora in the United States and Canada at the Dawn of the 21st Century'' (New York: SUNY University, 2009), 80–86.</ref> One of Snow's neighbouring Jamaican families, the Browns, first introduced the teenager to reggae and began calling him "Snow" and "Snow White".  With the help of his neighbours, Snow began borrowing and ordering reggae dub tapes to perform over. After he befriended Marvin Prince, Prince began referring to Snow with a phrased [[backronym]] meaning "Superb Notorious Outrageous Whiteboy".  Snow never claimed the title himself and simply continued to perform with the stage name of Snow.<ref>Bill Delingatt, "Shoveling Snow with DKO," ''Cashbox Magazine'', October 2, 2009, 1.</ref><ref>The origin of Snow's stage name is also a central issue in the legal battle between Marvin Prince and Darrin O'Brien.  See the following court documents: Prince v. O'brien, 256 AD 2d 208 1998 683 NY 2d 504.  Also available online: https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13886394386652351580&q=Prince+v.+O%27Brien,+234+A.D.2d&hl=en&as_sdt=100000000000002&as_vis=1.</ref>

=== Legal disputes over production of ''12 Inches of Snow''===
While touring as Snow's DJ in December 1994, Marvin Prince abruptly left the tour after discovering Snow, according to court documents, "was receiving more money from management than he was."  While listed as only the co-writer of the song "Runway" on the ''12 Inches of Snow'' album, Prince claimed to have co-written five songs and co-produced the album with Shan, Eng, and Salem.  Furthermore, Prince alleged in court that Eng and Salem provided "a draft of a multi-album production and recording agreement" for both Snow and himself.  Unable to understand the contract, Prince allegedly "sent a copy to his mother to get legal advice from her friend" and "never saw the agreement again."  Moreover, Prince claimed to have entered an "oral agreement" with Snow implying that the two would share profits from the album "fifty-fifty."  The first agreement, Prince alleged, occurred "in 1990, when the two men began working together on songs in Prince's basement and he "allegedly suggested to" Snow, "if something comes out of this, let's be partners." The second oral agreement, according to Prince, took place in August 1991 while Snow auditioned for Shan.  While Snow frequently referred to Prince as his partner in promotional videos, he claimed to have used the term "only in the slang sense." Prince, moreover, "admitted that these discussions were not concrete; the parties never organized a formal business plan, nor was plaintiff in New York to advance defendant's career."<ref>See O'Brien v. Prince, https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13886394386652351580&q=Prince+v.+O%27BRIEN,+256+AD2d+208&hl=en&as_sdt=100000000000002&as_vis=1</ref>

Shan, Eng, and Salem testified that they were unaware of a partnership between Snow and Prince, and Shan denied that Prince co-produced ''12 Inches of Snow'' and co-wrote the five songs in question. While initially winning a $1.5 million judgment, the court overturned the original ruling and dismissed Prince's suit on grounds that he had "no viable claims" to a partnership with Snow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13886394386652351580&q=Prince+v.+O%27BRIEN,+256+AD2d+208&hl=en&as_sdt=100000000000002&as_vis=1 |title=Prince v. O'BRIEN, 256 AD2d 208 – Google Scholar |publisher=Scholar.google.com |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref><ref>See: Betsey Powell, "Snow Vindicated: Court Overturns 1.5 Million Judgement," ''Toronto Star'', January 21, 1999, 1.</ref>

Snow told the ''[[Toronto Sun]]'', "I don't talk to him [Prince] no more. After he pulled his stunts, saying he did this and this when he really didn’t do nothing." Snow continued, "I just don’t bring nobody into the studio anymore, people sittin’ there and at the end of it think they did everything."<ref>Jim Slotek, "Clear Skies After Legal Snow Storm, ''Toronto Sun'', January 27, 1999, 1. </ref> 

In a 2019 interview, Prince recounted his history with Snow and described how he mentored, recorded demos for, scheduled showcase performances for, and ultimately, arranged for Snow to audition for MC Shan.  Prince recounted how he and Snow wrote ''Informer'' over the phone while Snow was serving his sentence at [[Maplehurst Correctional Complex]].  Prince recalled playing [[Junior Reid]]’s ''Foreign Mind'' over the phone, and Snow used the track's flute melody as the basis for ''Informer''. Parts of the first verse and third verse of ''Informer'', according to Prince, were reworked from [[Eek-A-Mouse]]’s performance of ''Tell Them'' at 1981 [[Sunsplash]]. Originally, Prince alleges, the final verse of ''Informer'' was written and performed by a second vocalist, named “Little Red.”<ref>Entertainment Report Podcast,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6ZSRVXIcnU DJ Marvin Prince]," Jun 7, 2019.  Accessed May 16, 2020.</ref>

Prince maintains that the judge who overturned the original ruling did so illegally, and he believes race played a role in the judge’s decision. <ref>Entertainment Report Podcast,"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R6ZSRVXIcnU DJ Marvin Prince]," Jun 7, 2019.  Accessed May 16, 2020.</ref>

Co-producer and co-writer Edmond Leary later claimed M.C. Shan unfairly received most of the production credits for ''12 Inches of Snow''.  He told [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]], "So actually, if you want the truth of the matter, if we hadn’t done it equally and had to split up the money I would have gotten 70% of writer’s [royalties] off that album they probably would have split up 30, because I wrote most of that album. Most of the words were mine, and the ideas and structures and backgrounds in the vocal booth with me telling him what keys to sing the harmonies in and what have you. So I had a lot to do with that sound that became so popular and went Platinum." After struggling with a cocaine addiction and homelessness, in 2013 Leary was a [[Street performance|street performer]] at [[Madison Square Park]] and Union Square. <ref>https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/r74z46/the-guy-who-produced-snows-informer-now-makes-bubbles-in-madison-square-park</ref>

=== International success===
In the mid-1990s, Snow's executive producer David Kenneth Eng broadened his artistic horizons and deepened his personal and spiritual roots by establishing a base in Asia. Eng included Snow as part of this expansion, leading the Canadian artist into a new market.<ref>See David Kenneth Eng's personal website: http://davidkennetheng.com/More_About_DK_Eng.html.  Accessed September 14, 2010.</ref> As a follow-up to ''12 Inches of Snow'', Snow recorded his second album ''Murder Love'' in Jamaica, Canada, and New York. While not a commercial success in North America, the album featured Snow performing with reggae and dancehall musicians [[Ninjaman]], [[Junior Reid]], [[Half Pint]], [[Buju Banton]], [[Beenie Man]], [[Dave Kelly (producer)|Dave Kelly]], and [[Sly and Robbie]].<ref>See Peter Howell, "Pop," ''Toronto Star'', February 25, 1995, K14; For Collaborations, see the credits for: Snow, ''Murder Love'', CD (New York: East/West, 1995).</ref> The "[[Anything for You (Snow song)|Anything for You]]" remix became a club favorite and, according to ''Billboard'''s Elena Oumano, made Snow a figure of respect on the Jamaican music scene.<ref>For the ''Billboard'' article, see: Elena Omanu, "Snow Displays Versatility, Growth on Justuss", ''Billboard'', December 14, 1996, 9.</ref><ref>For an example of the continued popularity of "Anything For You," see Andre Jebbinson, "Mellow Vibes, Musice and Crowd," ''Jamaica Gleaner News'', May 2, 2006.</ref> Indeed, "Anything For You" became the top-selling single in Jamaica in 1995 and "[[Si Wi Dem Nuh Know We]]" also reached the number one slot in Jamaica.<ref>Jamaican sales and charting data for "Anything For You" can be found in Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen, ''Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican music'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998), 211.</ref><ref>Jamaican charting data for "Si Wi Dem Nuh Know We" can be found in ''Pace'' (Johannesburg: Pace-Maker, 1995), 41.</ref> ''Murder Love'' proved to be a popular album in Asia, with the single "[[Sexy Girl (Snow song)|Sexy Girl]]" remaining on Japan's Top Singles chart for 16 weeks, ultimately reaching number one.<ref>See Japan charts for February 1995, with "Sexy Girl" reaching number one and remaining on the charts for 16 weeks.</ref><ref>For an online source see Super B.P.M Charts Tokyo at: http://www.sound.jp/tnsn/az/tokio-bpm_f.html</ref>  The success of ''Murder Love'' allowed Snow to tour Asia and collaborate with Thai rap artist [[Joey Boy]]. In 1996, Eng created Dimsum Entertainment, producing Joey Boy's album ''Fun, Fun, Fun''.  Ultimately, Snow performed on the chart-topping Thai single "Fun, Fun, Fun" and appeared in the music video.  Joey Boy returned the favor by appearing on Snow's Thai single "Me and Joey".  In 2008, Snow also featured Joey Boy on the track "Catch a Kick".<ref>For more on Joey Boy and Snow, see "Joey Boy Has Fun With Snow," ''Billboard'', November 23, 1996, 67.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidkennetheng.com/More_About_DK_Eng.html |title=More About DK Eng |publisher=Davidkennetheng.com |access-date=2011-03-02}}</ref>

That same year, Snow collaborated with [[Cyndi Lauper]] on [[Junior Vasquez]]'s ''Homegrown'' and [[Sly and Robbie]]'s ''Pop Goes the Dancehall'' remix of "[[Girls Just Want to Have Fun]]", retitled "Hey Now (Girls Just Want to Have Fun)". By the end of 1996, ''Murder Love'''s "Si We Dem Nuh Know We" received a [[Juno Awards of 1996|Juno nomination]] for Best Reggae Recording. Overall, the album produced three music videos: "[[Anything for You (Snow song)|Anything For You]]", "Anything For You (All Star Cast Remix)", and "Sexy Girl". In the film ''[[Klash]]'', Snow appears performing "Rivertown".<ref>For a collection of Snow's videos, see the VHS video: ''The Greatest Hits of Snow'' (Tokyo: East West Japan, 1998).</ref>

Snow followed up ''Murder Love'' with an album named after his daughter, ''Justuss''. The first single "[[Boom Boom Boogie]]" took Asia by storm, achieving gold status with the music video appearing on MTV Japan five to six times a day. Released in the United States and Canada in 1997, the single "If This World Were Mine" failed to chart but the video regularly appeared on [[The Box (US TV channel)|The Box]]. The album reached number 12 on the U.S. reggae charts and in 1998 was nominated for Best Reggae album at the [[Juno Awards of 1998#Best Reggae.2FCalypso Recording|Juno Awards]] in Vancouver, British Columbia.<ref>Elena Omanu, "Snow Displays Versatility, Growth on Justuss," ''Billboard'', December 14, 1996, 9.</ref> In late 1997, Snow released a "Greatest Hits" compilation, called ''The Greatest Hits of Snow''.<ref>See Stephanie Thomas Erlewine of the All Music guide at: {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r315363|pure_url=yes}} Accessed September 14, 2010.</ref><ref>For "If This World Were Mine" on The Box, see: "Video Monitor", ''Billboard'', May 17, 1997, 73.</ref>

In 2015, Snow and his then-fiancée, Tara Elizabeth, appeared on a [[CBC Television|CBC]] webseries called ''True Dating Stories''<ref>True Dating Stories: Tara (and Snow), October 20th, 2015. Available online at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWgwx6D-1VI Accessed October 23, 2015.</ref> to tell the story of one of their first dates: A walk in a ravine turned police operation.
Their episode was the most watched and the entire series won Best Web Series at the Hollywood Comedy Shorts Film Festival.

== Ethnicity and Canadian identity==
In ''Ethnicity, Politics, and Public Policy: Case Studies in Canadian Diversity'', Rebecca J. Haines examined Snow as a symbol of Canadian ethnic identity. Instead of hiding his "whiteness" and "Canadian-ness," Haines argues, Snow proudly boasts of his Irish heritage and pride in his family, the O'Briens, and traces his reggae roots to the diverse community of Allenbury. While other artists, such as [[Snoop Dogg]], don a [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] [[hockey jersey|jersey]] because of its resemblance to cannabis, "in the video for his single Anything For You, shot on location in Jamaica, the white Canadian reggae artist Snow is seen wearing the same jersey, perhaps in an attempt to proclaim his Canadian roots among the all-black cast of this video."<ref>Rebecca J. Haines, "Rap Music and Hip Hop Culture in Canada," in ''Ethnicity, Politics, and Public Policy: case studies in Canadian diversity'', Eds., Harold Martin Trooper and Morton Weinfield, (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1999): 65–66 and 72.</ref>

Many reggae purists viewed Snow, along with [[Ini Kamoze]], [[Diana King]], [[UB40]], [[Shaggy (musician)|Shaggy]] and [[Shabba Ranks]], as another example of "watered down" commercial reggae that rose to international popularity in the 1990s.<ref>Kevin O'Brien Chang and Wayne Chen, ''Reggae Routes: The Story of Jamaican music'' (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1998), 6–8.</ref> The [[sketch comedy]] show ''[[In Living Color]]'', parodied "Informer" by featuring fellow Canadian [[Jim Carrey]] as Snow in a sketch titled "Imposter".<ref>Carrey's parody can be seen at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Icb_tRTnA4g (accessed October 30, 2010)</ref>

In 1996, [[WBLS]] New York disc jockey Pat McKay observed, "purists have a problem with a non-Jamaican doing reggae. But I choose to think of it as the greatest compliment to reggae culture, and Snow is a genuine, dedicated artist. He has a fine singing voice, he's a great writer, and he very generously includes other artists in all of his work. His authenticity amplifies the realities of his generation, and his sensitivity conjures up intimacy with all of his love songs."<ref>Elena Omanu, "Snow Displays Vesatility, Growth on Justuss, ''Billboard'', December 14, 1996, 9.</ref>
