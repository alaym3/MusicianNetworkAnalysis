==Background==
Iron Chic was formed in 2008 after the dissolution of Phil Douglas' and [[Brian Crozier (guitarist)|Brian Crozier]]'s former band [[Latterman]]. Following Latterman's break up, Douglas initially joined Small Arms Dealer as a drummer which featured vocalist Jason Lubrano. Small Arms Dealer broke up shortly thereafter with Lubrano and Douglas deciding to start a new band altogether, recruiting Crozier, as well as drummer Gordon Lafler and bassist John Mee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.longislandpress.com/2015/11/14/9-questions-with-jason-lubrano-singer-in-long-island-punk-band-iron-chic/|title=9 Questions With Jason Lubrano, Singer in Long Island Punk Band Iron Chic|website=Longislandpress.com|date=14 November 2015|accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref> This band released the ''Demo 2008'' and ''Shitty Rambo'' under this line up. The band almost broke up the following year when Crozier had to leave the band due to health issues and Mee was asked to leave due to tension within the band.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/43206/interviews-iron-chic|title=Interviews: Iron Chic|website=Punknews.org|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref> The band immediately chose to continue with Rob McAllister of Capital, and Mike Bruno of Down In The Dumps, Get Bent and Jonesin' as well as owner/operator of Dead Broke Rekerds replacing Crozier and Mee respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadbrokerecords.com/press.php|title=Press and Reviews - Dead Broke Rekerds - Long Island NYs|website=Deadbrokerecords.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>  The new lineup released the debut album, ''[[Not Like This]]'', to critical acclaim. The band toured steadily through the year in support of ''Not Like This'' and released their 3rd EP, ''Split N' Shit'' in 2011.<ref>[http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/trying-to-make-it-happen-an-interview-with-jason-lubrano-of-iron-chic/] {{dead link|date=September 2020}}</ref><ref name="auto"/>

In 2013, the band released the ''Spooky Action'' EP in anticipation for their [[Bridge Nine Records]] debut ''[[The Constant One]]'', which followed later in the year to once again critical acclaim. In 2015 the band replaced Rob McAllister with Broadcaster guitarist Jesse Litwa and released 2 EP's over the course the year: A split with New Mexico's Low Culture and the ''Y's'' single. Rob McAllister unexpectedly died on January 9, 2016 at the age of 36.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://substreammagazine.com/2016/01/iron-chic-guitarist-rob-mcallister-dies/|title=Iron Chic guitarist Rob McAllister passes away - Substream Magazine|first=Scott|last=Heisel|date=10 January 2016|publisher=|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="uproxx.com">{{cite web|url=https://uproxx.com/music/iron-chic-you-cant-stay-here-interview/|title=Iron Chic Fights Grief With Riffs On ’You Can’t Stay Here’|date=28 September 2017|website=Uproxx.com|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref>

In 2017 the band released their third album overall and first for [[SideOneDummy Records]] titled ''[[You Can't Stay Here]]''. Written in response to singer Jason Lubrano's divorce and McAllister's death, the album showcased more darker themes and experimentation in contrast to their previous work. They released their first music video for the album's second track, "My Best Friend (Is A Nihilist)". The band toured with [[Propaghandi]], [[Hot Water Music]] and Heartsounds in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/15343/iron-chic-you-cant-stay-here|title=Iron Chic - You Can't Stay Here|website=Punknews.org|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="exclaim.ca">{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/iron_chic-you_cant_stay_here|title=Iron Chic You Can't Stay Here|website=Exclaim.ca|accessdate=11 July 2018}}</ref><ref name="uproxx.com"/>

It was released via Recess Records and the band's own Dead Broke Rekerds.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/68378/media-iron-chic-and-toys-that-kill-to-release-split-lp|title=Music: Iron Chic and Toys That Kill to release split LP|website=Punknews.org|accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Iron-Chic-Toys-That-Kill-Iron-Chic-Toys-That-Kill-Split/release/12763516|title=Iron Chic, Toys That Kill - Iron Chic / Toys That Kill Split|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=22 September 2020}}</ref>
