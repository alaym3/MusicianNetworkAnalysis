Emilie Autumn Liddell.}}</ref> (born September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name '''Emilie Autumn''', is an American singer-songwriter, poet, author and violinist. Autumn's musical style is described by her as "Fairy Pop", "Fantasy Rock" or "Victoriandustrial". It is influenced by [[glam rock]] and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the [[Victorian era]]. Performing with her all-female backup dancers The Bloody Crumpets, Autumn incorporates elements of classical music, cabaret, electronica, and glam rock with theatrics, and [[burlesque]].<ref name="Bizarre mag">{{cite web |last1=Stanborough |first1=Denise |title=Emilie Autumn |url=http://www.bizarremag.com/entertainment/interviews/9292/emilie_autumn.html |website=Bizarre Magazine |access-date=1 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100604060630/http://www.bizarremag.com/entertainment/interviews/9292/emilie_autumn.html |archive-date=4 June 2010 |date=April 2010}}</ref><ref name=gazette>{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09337/1017976-437.stm |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=December 3, 2009 |title=Weekend Hotlist |access-date=January 3, 2010 }}</ref>

Growing up in [[Malibu, California]], Autumn began learning the violin at the age of four and left regular school five years later with the goal of becoming a world-class violinist; she practiced eight or nine hours a day and read a wide range of literature. Progressing to writing her own music, she studied under various teachers and went to [[Indiana University]], which she left over issues regarding the relationship between classical music and the appearance of the performer. Through her own [[independent label]] Traitor Records, Autumn debuted with her classical album ''[[On a Day...|On a Day: Music for Violin & Continuo]]'', followed by the release in 2003 of her album ''[[Enchant (album)|Enchant]]''.

Autumn appeared in singer [[Courtney Love]]'s backing band on her 2004 ''[[America's Sweetheart (Courtney Love album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' tour and returned to Europe. She released the 2006 album ''[[Opheliac]]'' with the German label [[Trisol Music Group]]. In 2007, she released ''[[Laced/Unlaced]]''; the re-release of ''On a Day...'' appeared as ''Laced'' with songs on the [[electric violin]] as ''Unlaced''. She later left Trisol to join New York based The End Records in 2009 and release ''Opheliac'' in the United States, where previously it had only been available as an import. In 2012, she released the album ''[[Fight Like a Girl (Emilie Autumn album)|Fight Like a Girl]]''. She played the role of the Painted Doll in [[Darren Lynn Bousman]]'s 2012 film ''[[The Devil's Carnival]]'', as well as its 2015 sequel, ''[[Alleluia! The Devil's Carnival]]''.

For her live performances, which she calls [[dinner theatre]] because of her practice of throwing tea and tea-time snacks off of the stage, Autumn makes use of [[burlesque]]—"a show that was mainly using humour and sexuality to make a mockery of things that were going on socially and politically"<ref name="March 2010 Metal discovery"/>—to counterbalance the more morbid topics discussed in her music, such as abuse, suicide and self-mutilation.<ref name="Bizarre mag"/> Her shows feature handmade costumes,<ref name="March 2010 Metal discovery"/> fire tricks, theatrics, and her all-female backing band, The Bloody Crumpets, a group whose members have variously included burlesque performer [[Veronica Varlow]] as The Naughty Veronica, performance artist Maggie Lally as Captain Maggot, Jill Evyn as Lady Amalthea (or Moth), actress and performer Beth Hinderliter as The Blessed Contessa, actress Aprella Godfrey Barule as Lady Aprella, German musician Lucina as Little Lucina, cellist Sarah Kim as Lady Joo Hee, German costume designer Vecona as Captain Vecona, Jesselynn Desmond as Little Miss Sugarless, and [[Ulorin Vex]]. Her intention is for the live shows to be a statement of "anti-repression" and empowerment.<ref name="Metal discovery pg 2"/>

==Personal life==
She keeps a ritual of drawing a heart on her cheek as a symbol of protection.<ref name="Bizarre mag"/>

Autumn became vegetarian at age eleven after being unable to rationalize why she should eat farm animals but not her pet dog; in her late-teens, she became [[vegan]].<ref name="PETA">{{cite web|url=http://www.peta2.com/OUTTHERE/o-EmilieAutumn.asp|title=Pro Violinist Emilie Autumn's Interview|author=Harkens, Ray|publisher=Peta2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527141740/http://www.peta2.com/OUTTHERE/o-EmilieAutumn.asp|archive-date=May 27, 2012|access-date=November 12, 2014}}</ref> She has stated she believes that there is a link between the treatment of women and animals in society.<ref name="PETA"/> In August 2014, Autumn said she had developed [[copper toxicity]] and was no longer vegan, although still a committed vegetarian.<ref>{{cite web|title=Matcha Steamed Buns (Gluten Free)|url=http://www.emilieautumn.com/rollingscone/matcha-steamed-buns/|website=www.emilieautumn.com|publisher=Emilie Autumn's Rolling Stone|access-date=June 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204055415/http://www.emilieautumn.com/rollingscone/|archive-date=February 4, 2016 |date=August 31, 2014}}</ref>
