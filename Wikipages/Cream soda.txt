'''Cream soda''' (also known as '''creme soda''' or '''creaming soda''') is a sweet [[soft drink]]. Generally flavored with vanilla and based on the taste of an [[Ice cream float|ice cream soda]], a wide range of variations can be found worldwide.

==History and development==
A recipe for cream soda written by E. M. Sheldon and published in ''Michigan Farmer'' in 1852 called for water, [[cream of tartar]] ([[Potassium bitartrate]]), [[Epsom salts]], sugar, egg, and milk, to be mixed, then heated, and mixed when cool with water and a quarter teaspoonful of baking soda ([[sodium bicarbonate]]) to make an [[Effervescence|effervescent]] drink. It was suggested as a [[Temperance movement|temperance]] drink preferable to those of [[Bacchus|"Uncle Bacchus"]] and in compliance with the recently introduced [[Maine law]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sd7hAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA183 |title=Receipts |journal=Michigan Farmer |volume=X |date=June 1852 |issue=6 |page=183}}</ref>

Alexander C. Howell, of Vienna, New Jersey, was granted a patent for "cream soda-water" on June 27, 1865. Howell's cream soda-water was made with sodium bicarbonate, water, sugar, egg whites, wheat flour, and "any of the usual flavoring materials—such as oil of lemon, extracts of vanilla, pine-apple, to suit the taste". Before drinking, the cream soda-water was mixed with water and an acid such as tartaric acid or citric acid.<ref name="howell">{{cite patent
