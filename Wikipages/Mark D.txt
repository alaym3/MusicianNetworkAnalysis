==Music==
From university onwards, Mark D (D standing for "degenerate") played in various bands including the [[Fat Tulips]], Confetti (when he was known as David), the Pleasure Heads (when he was known as Mark Randyhead), Oscar, Servalan and Sundress, and appeared on dozens of releases. He published and edited fanzines, including the underground C86 fanzine ''Two Pint Take Home''. He is a co-owner of Heaven Records.<ref name=biogtext>[http://www.stuckism.com/MarkD/IndexText.html "Mark D: Biog/text"], stuckism.com. Retrieved 13 February 2008</ref>

The Fat Tulips were formed in 1987 and have been described as "incredibly skilled in the art of buzzing electric guitars, ferocious tempos, pristine pop melodies and lyrics that weren't nearly as sweet as they sounded at first listen."<ref name=flux>[http://www.appelstein.com/cif/sheggi.html Caught in Flux no. 7, 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417074443/http://www.appelstein.com/cif/sheggi.html |date=17 April 2006 }} Retrieved 24 March 2006</ref> The Fat Tulips broke up in the mid-1990s.

==Painting==

An interest in the music of [[Billy Childish]] led onto Childish's paintings, which he acquired, and subsequently also the work of other artists in the Stuckist group. He contacted two artists who had been exhibited by the Stuckists, [[Stella Vine]] and [[Gina Bold]], both of whom refused to sell him work, because of his connection with Childish. Vine responded with an email, which said, "Go fuck yourself".<ref name=deedes/><ref name=biogtext/> He was encouraged and given advice by Stuckist co-founder, [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], without whom Mark D said, "I could easily have given up on doing my own work."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.heyokamagazine.com/HEYOKA.8.PAINTINGS.GinaBold.htm | title = Paintings – Gina Bold | accessdate = 19 June 2007 | last = D | first = Mark | author2 = Thomson, Charles | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070712051354/http://www.heyokamagazine.com/HEYOKA.8.PAINTINGS.GinaBold.htm | archivedate = 12 July 2007 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

His paintings make visual and verbal comments on well-known figures in the art world, starting with Billy Childish, [[Tracey Emin]], [[Stella Vine]] and [[Damien Hirst]]. He describes Emin as "without doubt a very talented artist whose work I greatly admire."<ref name=biogtext/>

<blockquote>Some outstanding musicians have proved that all you need are 3 chords and a cheap guitar to come up with a classic. I find it much more interesting to listen to some low budget production record full of life and energy with lots of good ideas, (e.g. early [[The Clash|Clash]] and [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]], [[The Vaselines]], [[The White Stripes]] and, of course, Billy Childish with the Buff Medways etc.) than some over-produced bland pomp like [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]], [[Coldplay]] or [[U2]].<ref name=biogtext/></blockquote>
