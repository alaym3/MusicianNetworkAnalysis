==Life==

Yotuel was born in [[Havana]] into an Afro-Cuban family. His name is a combination of three Spanish pronouns ''yo'', ''tú'' and ''él'' (I, you, and he). His parents could not agree on a name so they decided to combine all 3 pronouns. He has developed a performing arts career and is a Cuban expatriate.

==Career==

Yotuel began performing rap music early in life. When he was 18 years old he got together with his friend Hiram Riveri (aka Ruzzo) and Joel Pando and all three started a rap group called Amenaza (Menace). Having any success as a rap artist in Cuba proved difficult so he also started acting in theatre and television and doing some modelling work. During the year 1996 [[Flaco Pro|Liván Nuñez]], a Cuban singer who lived in France, visited Cuba and told the struggling Amenaza group about his interest in recording some songs with them. In 1997 they won the first prize in the 3rd edition of the underground Cuban Rap Music Awards, later on that year they would record a demo produced by [[X Alfonso]]. This first group had a very good acceptance and a lot of radio play in Cuba and some national television appearances in Cuba. From all this found fame they meet Petra Morales a representative of a French [[nonprofit|non-profit]] organization called ADHESIF, she liked their work so she arranged for them to travel to France from Cuba to do a cultural exchange program and to promote them outside Cuba.

While in France very few things were being done regarding the group, they had very few events and shows planned and it seemed that they did not agree with the same special requirements they had for them, one thing led to another and the band ended up homeless in the streets of Paris for about a month, they would eat at friends homes and back to sleeping in the [[Paris Métro]].

There was already a strong rap music scene in Paris and they took advantage of this, they got together with Livan and the producer Niko Noki introduced them to another singer named Roldan at a club called Cupol and from that moment the group [[Orishas (band)|Orishas]] was born. Right away they started writing lyrics and musical themes for the demo that would later become their first album titled ''[[A Lo Cubano]]''.

Since then Yotuel has not stopped working. He has worked on three television series ''La Casa de los Lios'' and ''Cuando Yo Sea Grande'' (Peruvian TV) and in Spain ''Un Paso Adelante''. Movies include the features ''Color Habana'' and ''Perfecto Amor Equivocado'' and ''Chico Nuevo en la Ciudad'' . He has also starred in ad campaigns for [[Ducados (cigarette)|Ducados]] and [[Havana Club]]. His work with [[Orishas (band)|Orishas]] went on with ''Emigrante'' (2002), ''El Kilo'' (2005), ''Antidiótico'' (2007), ''Cosita Buena'' (2008) and again with ''Gourmet'' (2018).

Besides being a singer, actor and a fashion model, Yotuel has also done work as a composer and record producer. He has worked as a record producer on two songs ''El rey de la pachanga'' and ''Distinto'' from the recordings ''Emigrante'' and ''El Kilo'' respectively. On 2019, Yotuel released the song "Insomnio" <ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dCtuqJbjUo</ref> after receiving images of the struggles that Cubans in the island were going through.<ref>https://adncuba.com/noticias-de-cuba/cultura/me-quitan-el-sueno-la-escasez-y-la-pobreza-de-cuba-dice-yotuel-de-orishas</ref> "Tell me if sleeping is easy for you, tell me if waking up is not the way out," sings the Cuban group Orishas in "Insomnia," a song composed by Yotuel.

In February 2021 the song "[[Patria y Vida]]" was released by Yotuel, [[Descemer Bueno]], [[Gente de Zona]], [[Luis Manuel Otero Alcántara]], [[Maykel Osorbo]] and [[DJ El Funky]]. It was composed by all of them and [[Beatriz Luengo]].<ref>https://www.cubanoticias360.com/descemer-bueno-crea-discordia-publicar-division-regalias-patria-vida/</ref> The song became a hit and the slogan "[[Patria y Vida]]" ("Homeland and Life") was associated with the July [[2021 Cuban protests]]. It is an inversion of the [[Cuban Revolution]] motto ''[[Patria o Muerte]]'' ("Homeland or Death").<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Chappell |first1=Bill |title=The Hip-Hop Song That's Driving Cuba's Unprecedented Protests |work=[[NPR.org]] |date=2021-07-13 |url=https://www.npr.org/2021/07/13/1015318087/the-hip-hop-song-thats-driving-cubas-unprecedented-protests |language=en |access-date=2021-07-13 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Cassady |first1=Daniel |title='Patria y Vida': anti-government protests sweep Cuba, as artist-led movement gains ground |work=[[The Art Newspaper]] |date=2021-07-12 |url=https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/anti-government-protests-sweep-cuba |language=en |access-date=2021-07-13 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=San Martín |first1=Nancy |last2=Whitefield |first2=Mimi |title='Your evil revolution': How a reggaeton anthem inspired Cuba protests |work=[[National Geographic]] |date=2021-07-13 |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/cuba-protests |language=en |access-date=2021-07-13 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title='Patria y Vida': la canción que enfurece y hace temblar a la dictadura de Cuba |work=[[Infobae]] |date=2021-02-18 |url=https://www.infobae.com/america/america-latina/2021/02/18/patria-y-vida-la-cancion-que-enfurece-y-hace-temblar-a-la-dictadura-de-cuba/ |language=es |access-date=2021-07-13 |df=mdy-all }}{{Cite news|last=Janetsky|first=Megan|date=2021-07-13|title='Patria y Vida' — Homeland and Life — Watchwords in Cuba's Protests|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/13/world/americas/cuba-protests-Patria-y-Vida.html|access-date=2021-07-18|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>.
