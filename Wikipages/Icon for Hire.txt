== History ==

=== Origins: 2007–2009 ===
[[File:Ariel Bloomer 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8|Singer Ariel Bloomer performing in 2016]]
The band was formed in [[Decatur, Illinois]] by vocalist Ariel Bloomer and guitarist Shawn Jump. When the two met in 2007, Ariel, upon discovering that Jump played guitar, initiated a musical collaboration between the two of them. When the need for a drummer arose, Jump recruited Adam Kronshagen, an old friend he had held [[jam session]]s with as a member of the local party scene (Jump was six months clean at the time).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://breathecast.christianpost.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Icon.For.Hire/Interview-1250_5458.htm|title=Interview: Icon For Hire's Ariel On New Album, Her Conversion Story, and More|last=Brooks|first=Jessica|date=August 26, 2011|work=BREATHEcast|access-date=March 9, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130119023605/http://breathecast.christianpost.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Icon.For.Hire/Interview-1250_5458.htm|archive-date=January 19, 2013}}</ref><ref name="Christian Post">{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/interview-christian-female-rocker-makes-a-move-54594|title=Christian female rocker makes a move|work=[[The Christian Post]]|date=August 30, 2011}}</ref> The band officially formed in November of that year, after bassist Joshua Davis joined. They choose their name as a satirical comment on the state of the music industry.<ref name="interlinc">{{cite interview|title=Icon For Hire|url=http://www.interlinc-online.com/news/article_877.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514031903/http://interlinc-online.com/news/article_877.html|archive-date=May 14, 2012|work=Interlínc|access-date=April 22, 2012|interviewer=Fasig, Jacob|type=interview}}</ref>

The band played their first show in a local club before an audience of family and friends, who gave them a positive reception. Ariel has been quoted as saying of the performance, "Our passion for music was there; whatever we lacked in sound we made up for with enthusiasm." Over the next two years, the band toured throughout the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] and released two [[Extended play|EPs]], the self-titled ''Icon for Hire EP'' in 2008 and ''The Grey EP'' in 2009.<ref name="CR profile">{{cite web|title=Icon For Hire: The rockers bemused by the Paramore and Evanescence comparisons|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/articles/music/Icon_For_Hire_The_rockers_bemused_by_the_Paramore_and_Evanescence_comparisons_/46555/p1/|work=[[Cross Rhythms]]|access-date=January 14, 2012|author=Cummings, Tony|author-link=Tony Cummings|date=January 2012}}</ref> During that same year, Davis left the band.

=== Tooth & Nail, ''Scripted'' and self-titled album: 2009–2015 ===

[[File:Icon for Hire in concert.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Guitarist Shawn Jump performing in 2011]]
In late 2009, the band was contacted by [[Tooth & Nail Records]] through [[Myspace]]. The label then sent representatives to one of the band's shows, and eventually signed them in July 2010.<ref name="CR profile" /> "We are thrilled to be joining such an established and well-respected group at Tooth & Nail," shared the band upon their signing. "It's a label that has a history of consistently putting out good music and really working side by side with their artists. Because we've been doing this thing on our own for over two years, it feels great to partner with Tooth & Nail. We can't wait to record our debut full-length and see where this road takes us." They spent the last quarter of 2010 in the studio with producers Rob Hawkins and [[Aaron Sprinkle]] recording their first full-length album, ''[[Scripted]]'', which was released by the label on August 23, 2011. The album made it on the US ''Billboard'' charts at No.&nbsp;7 for Hard Rock Albums, No.&nbsp;5 for Christian Albums, No.&nbsp;16 for Alternative Albums, No.&nbsp;22 for Rock Albums, and No.&nbsp;95 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It also sold more than 4,300 units in the first week of release and broke the record for first week sales on a Tooth & Nail debut album.<ref>{{cite web|title=Icon for Hire Touring With RED and Brian "Head" Welch|url=http://christianmusic.about.com/b/2011/09/13/icon-for-hire-touring-with-red-and-brian-head-welch.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=February 12, 2012|author=Kim Jones|date=September 2011}}</ref> The band also achieved success with the album's lead single "[[Make a Move (Icon for Hire song)|Make a Move]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;13 on [[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]/[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'s Christian Rock chart and had an accompanying [[music video]] exclusively released online by ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine's website. Also in 2011, the band acquired bassist Josh Kincheloe.

In December 2011, Ariel stated that, while the band had been focusing on extensive touring rather than writing new music, she had "a feeling that we'll start piecing together some demos shortly."<ref name="SGD">{{cite interview|interviewer=Taneica Phillips |title=Shatterproof Celebrity: Ariel of Icon For Hire |url=http://shatterproofglassdolls.com/fashion/shatterproof-celebrity-ariel-of-icon-for-hire/ |date=December 28, 2011 |work=Shatterproof Glass Dolls |access-date=August 17, 2011}}</ref> In a later interview with [[TVU Music channel]], she revealed that the band was in the early stages of writing songs for a second album.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Icon for Hire |interviewer=Jared |title=Icon for Hire on TVU's Most Wanted (Pt. 2) |type=Video interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_rMYz2mS6RM |work=[[TVU Music channel]] |date=February 3, 2012 |access-date=August 17, 2012}}</ref> In an interview with [[KHRT-FM]], the band expressed their desire for the album to be "heavier....more aggressive", with more [[bubblegum pop]] production and possible [[hip hop music|hip hop]] elements.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Icon for Hire|title=Icon For Hire: The ATO Interview Pt. 2 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ru2pYASkGk|work=The Alternative Takeover|publisher=[[KHRT-FM]]|date=December 14, 2011|access-date=August 17, 2012}}</ref> On August 15, 2013, Icon for Hire premiered their new single "Cynics and Critics" via [[lyric video]] and announced their second album, the self-titled ''[[Icon for Hire (album)|Icon for Hire]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/icon_for_hire_release_new_song_cynics_critics|title = Icon For Hire release new song, "Cynics & Critics"|author = Bird, Michele|access-date = August 17, 2013|date = August 16, 2013|work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]}}</ref> The album was released on October 15, 2013, whereupon it reached No. 66 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and received largely positive reviews.

=== Departure from Tooth & Nail and ''You Can't Kill Us'' 2015–present ===

On June 6, 2015, Icon for Hire announced that they broke their contract with Tooth & Nail records to go independent, citing creative, ideological, and technical differences with the label.

== Musical style and influences ==

The band's sound combines [[pop punk]] and [[alternative metal]] elements with [[Strings (music)|strings]] and [[Electronics (music)|electronics]].<ref name="Sputnikmusic">{{cite web|title=Scripted|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/49703/Icon-For-Hire-Scripted/|work=[[Sputnikmusic]]|access-date=July 30, 2012|author="pizzamachine" (Contributor)}}</ref> Jamie Maxwell of [[Cross Rhythms]] describes them as a [[punk rock|punk]] band, but notes that "the electronic influence evident in some of their tracks is a definite nod to the likes of [[Linkin Park]] and others in the [[nu metal]] mould."<ref name="CR review">{{cite web|title=Scripted|url=http://www.crossrhythms.co.uk/products/Icon_For_Hire/Scripted/117100/|work=[[Cross Rhythms]]|access-date=January 14, 2012|author=Jamie Maxwell|date=November 2011}}</ref> In describing the band's sound, lead singer Ariel has said that the band is "first and foremost just a rock band. That's where our roots are and where our hearts are. But a few years ago we started really getting into [[synthesizer|synths]] and [[programming (music)|programming]]. We love the combination of brutal, in-your-face riffs, with the fun candy of [[pop music|pop]] production sprinkled all over it."<ref name="Christian Post" />

Influences cited by the band have included [[hard rock]] bands like Linkin Park, [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Pantera]], [[Mötley Crüe]], and [[Rage Against the Machine]], as well as pop- and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]-oriented artists such as [[Skrillex]], [[The Black Eyed Peas]], [[Dessa]], and [[Lady Gaga]].<ref name="interlinc" /><ref name="SGD" />

=== Comparisons to other rock bands ===

The band's sound has often been compared to that of other female-fronted [[Rock music|rock]] bands, particularly [[Paramore]].<ref name="CR profile" /><ref name="CR review" /><ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|title=Scripted|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/scripted-r2229035|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=February 6, 2012|first=David |last=Jeffries}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Scripted|url=http://christianmusic.about.com/od/Christian-Cd-Reviews-I-J/fr/Icon-For-Hire-Scripted.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|access-date=February 6, 2012|first=Kim |last=Jones}}</ref> Nathaniel Schexnayder of Jesus Freak Hideout went so far as to label the band's debut album ''[[Scripted]]'' as generic, saying that the band "borrows their elements from other female fronted acts like [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]], [[Fireflight]], and [[Paramore]] at an alarming degree."<ref name="JFH">{{cite web|title=Scripted|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/Scripted.asp|last=Schexnayder |first=Nathaniel|publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout|access-date=February 6, 2012|date=August 2011}}</ref> Ariel has taken issue with these comparisons, citing the band's "unique combination of programming/pop elements, mixed with a commercial rock sound" as a distinguishing element, in addition to the band's [[concert|live performances]]: "We've never had someone come see us live and compare us to other bands." She has also noted such comparisons as unfairly [[sexism|discriminatory]]: "It frustrates me how in so many other industries you are acknowledged for your skill and education, but in music somehow if you're a chick you better be bringing something extraordinarily mind-blowing to the table in order to have a shot. It's a bit sexist I think."<ref name="CR profile" /> Their song "Now You Know" addresses the subject at length.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

== Religious affiliation ==

Icon for Hire have had complicated relations with the [[Christian music]] market as they are not categorized as a Christian band. Ariel stated that they do not play music for Christians but to "save the world"<ref>{{cite web|title=Icon for Hire|type=video interview|url=http://videos.herald-review.com/p/video?id=5229941|work=[[Herald & Review]]|access-date=August 15, 2012|author=Rueff, Ashley |author2=Sullivan, Hugh (videographer)|date=July 2009}}</ref> and that they try to distance themselves from identifying as part of the [[Christian music industry]] to avoid pushing non-Christians away from hearing that message.<ref>{{cite web|author=Icon For Hire: Self-Titled Sophomore Album Review |url=http://www.jesusrock.net/album-review-icon-for-hire |title=Album Review - Icon For Hire |publisher=Jesusrock.net |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Icon For Hire - Icon For Hire|type=review|url=http://mauce.nl/site/icon-for-hire-icon-for-hire/|work=The Metal Resource|access-date=April 24, 2014|author=Pete W}}</ref> Despite this, several writers have identified Icon for Hire as part of the Christian music scene,<ref name="Sputnikmusic" /><ref name="CR review" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Music: Icon For Hire strives to be worth looking up to|url=http://www.chron.com/life/houston-belief/article/Music-Icon-For-Hire-strives-to-be-worth-looking-2151707.php|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|access-date=August 17, 2012|author=Matthews, Kent|date=September 1, 2011|quote=Christian contemporary band Icon for Hire has a new CD out, Scripted.

David Jeffries pointed out that "Christian ideals are the driving force" in the lyrics on ''Scripted'', though he acknowledged that "you could look at this as a secular rebellion against the mopey 'scene' bands and still thrill at Icon for Hire's fresh attitude and sense of purpose."<ref name="Allmusic" /> Schexnayder, while admitting that "the group doesn't wear their faith on their sleeve in their messages", noted a general encouraging message on the album and singled out the song "The Grey" as containing "spiritual references".<ref name="JFH" /> Kim Jones of [[About.com]] said that the categorization was inaccurate "if you're looking to use the term to put them into a nice and safe box, limited to only a Christian audience."<ref name="About.com">{{cite web|title=Icon For Hire|url=http://christianmusic.about.com/od/I/p/Icon-For-Hire.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|access-date=August 17, 2012|author=Jones, Kim}}</ref>
