'''Three Dog Night''' is an American rock band formed in 1967, with founding members consisting of vocalists [[Danny Hutton]], [[Cory Wells]], and [[Chuck Negron]]. This lineup was soon augmented by [[Jimmy Greenspoon]] (keyboards), [[Joe Schermie]] (bass), [[Michael Allsup]] (guitar), and [[Floyd Sneed]] (drums). The band had 21 ''Billboard'' Top 40 hits between 1969 and 1975, with three hitting number one.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/three-dog-night|title=Three Dog Night|website=Billboard}}</ref> Three Dog Night recorded many songs written by outside songwriters, and they helped to introduce mainstream audiences to writers such as [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]] ("[[An Old Fashioned Love Song]]") and [[Hoyt Axton]] ("[[Joy to the World (Three Dog Night song)|Joy to the World]]").

==Name origin==
The official commentary included in the CD set ''Celebrate: The Three Dog Night Story, 1965–1975'' states that vocalist Danny Hutton's girlfriend, actress [[June Fairchild]] (best known as the "Ajax Lady" from the [[Cheech and Chong]] movie ''[[Up In Smoke]]'') suggested the name after reading a magazine article about [[Aboriginal Australians]], in which it was explained that on cold nights they would customarily sleep in a hole in the ground while embracing a [[dingo]], a native species of wild dog. On colder nights they would sleep with two dogs and, if the night were freezing, it was a "three dog night".<ref name=latimes>{{cite news|first=Steve|last=Chawkins|title=June Fairchild dies at 68; former actress lived on skid row |url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-june-fairchild-20150219-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 18, 2015 |access-date=March 15, 2015}}</ref>

Musician [[Van Dyke Parks]], an arranger at [[Warner Bros Records]], disputed the above story and claimed that he coined the name. He wrote, "I wuz nuts about Hutton's girlfriend. Quite a dancer. Yet, she didn’t read Mankind magazine, nor have an inkling of anthropology and the cold aboriginal nights that inspired my suggestion."<ref>{{cite tweet|user=thevandykeparks|author=Van Dyke Parks|author-link=Van Dyke Parks|number=1039199643651821569|date=September 10, 2018|title=I wuz nuts about Hutton’s girlfriend.

==History==

===Background===

The three vocalists, [[Danny Hutton]] (who got his start with Hanna-Barbera Records in 1964), [[Chuck Negron]], and [[Cory Wells]] (who landed a recording contract with Dunhill Records) first came together in 1967. They initially went by the name of Redwood and made some recordings with [[Brian Wilson]] while [[the Beach Boys]] were working on the album ''[[Wild Honey (album)|Wild Honey]]''.

Redwood were briefly poised to be one of the first artists signed to the Beach Boys' [[Brother Records]]. According to Beach Boy [[Mike Love]], "[Brian] had them in the studio for several days, and he was really funny. They didn't meet up to his expectations. ... They'd go in and they wouldn't sing well enough for him. ... but they went off and made billions."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tobler |first1=John |author1-link=John Tobler |title=The Beach Boys |date=1978 |publisher=Chartwell Books |isbn=0890091749 |url=https://archive.org/details/beachboys00tobl/|url-access=registration|p=45}}</ref> Brian attempted to produce an album for Redwood, but after the recording of three songs, including "[[Time to Get Alone]]" and "[[Darlin' (The Beach Boys song)|Darlin']]", this motion was halted by his bandmates, who wanted Brian to focus on the Beach Boys' contractual obligations.<ref>{{cite book|first=Peter Ames|last=Carlin|author-link=Peter Ames Carlin|title=Catch a Wave: The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of the Beach Boys' Brian Wilson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eYyovo_AbqAC|year=2006|publisher=Rodale|isbn=978-1-59486-320-2|p=130}}</ref> According to Negron, due to the commercial failure of ''[[Smiley Smile]]'' and Brian's waning commitment to his band, "the other Beach Boys wanted Brian's immense songwriting and producing talents used strictly to enhance their own careers".<ref name="priorelostmasterpiece129">{{cite book |first=Domenic |last=Priore |title=Smile: The Story of Brian Wilson's Lost Masterpiece |year=2007 |pages=127–129}}</ref> Negron then noted that he would have done the same thing if in the Beach Boys' position.<ref name="priorelostmasterpiece129"/>

Shortly after abandoning the Redwood moniker in 1968, the vocalists hired a group of backing musicians – Ron Morgan on guitar, [[Floyd Sneed]] on drums, [[Joe Schermie]] from the Cory Wells Blues Band on bass, and [[Jimmy Greenspoon]] on keyboards – and soon took the name Three Dog Night. Morgan left the band before its first album was recorded and subsequently joined the [[Electric Prunes]]. [[Michael Allsup]] was quickly recruited to replace Morgan on guitar.<ref name="auto">{{cite book|title=One Is the Loneliest Number: On the Road and Behind the Scenes With the Legendary Rock Band Three Dog Night|first1=Jimmy|last1=Greenspoon|author-link=Jimmy Greenspoon|first2=Mark|last2=Bego|date=1991|isbn=9780886876470}}</ref>

=== 1968–1972 ===
[[File:Three Dog Night 1969.JPG|thumb|left|Negron, Wells and Hutton in 1969]]

Three Dog Night made its official debut in 1968 at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], at a 5 p.m. press party hosted by [[Dunhill Records]]. They were still in the process of making their first album ''[[Three Dog Night (album)|Three Dog Night]]'' when they heard the favorable reactions from the hypercritical audience.<ref name=":0">Orloff, Kathy. "Three Dog Night—A Howling Success Story". ''Los Angeles Times'', May 23, 1971, pp. 1-q16.</ref>

The album ''Three Dog Night'' was a success with its hit songs "[[One (Harry Nilsson song)|One]]", "[[Try A Little Tenderness]]", and "Nobody" and helped the band gain recognition and become one of the top drawing concert acts of their time.<ref name=":0" />

In December 1972, Three Dog Night hosted [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve|Dick Clark's first New Year's Eve special]], which was then entitled Three Dog Night's New Year's Rockin' Eve.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dick Clark's New Year's Eve special first aired on this day in 1972|url=https://www.cltampa.com/music/music-news/article/21038984/dick-clarks-new-years-eve-special-first-aired-on-this-day-in-1972|first=Gabe |last=Echazabal |work=Creative Loafing|access-date=December 31, 2018}}</ref>

===1973–1976===
In 1973, Three Dog Night filed a $6 million lawsuit against their former booking agent, American Talent International (ATI), for continuing to advertise in the media that the band was still with their agency when in fact they signed with [[William Morris Agency]] in October 1972. Other damages were sought due to ATI taking deposits for booking Three Dog Night, whom they no longer represented.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NQkEAAAAMBAJ&q=three+dog+night&pg=PA66 |title=ATI Sued by 3 Dog Night|work=Billboard|via=Google Books |date=February 3, 1973 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

Joe Schermie left in early 1973 due to "problems arising that were apparently unresolvable".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelallsup.com/14ch_3.htm |title=Michael Allsup Website|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> His replacement was Jack Ryland in 1973, and the band then became an eight-piece with the inclusion of a second keyboard player, [[Skip Konte]] (ex-[[Blues Image]]), in late 1973. In late 1974, Allsup and Sneed left to form a new band, SS Fools, with Schermie and [[Bobby Kimball]] of [[Toto (band)|Toto]]. New guitarist James "Smitty" Smith and drummer Mickey McMeel were recruited, but by 1975, Smith was replaced by [[Al Ciner]] from [[Rufus (band)|Rufus]] and [[the American Breed]], and Ryland by Rufus bassist Dennis Belfield. Mickey McMeel would go on to co-star as "Turkey", the drummer of Kaptain Kool and the Kongs, in the children's television series "The Kroft Super Show". 

By 1973, Danny Hutton was sick on a regular basis and had developed [[jaundice]] from incessant and uncontrolled drug abuse. The band was forced to hire a [[registered nurse]] to administer [[Vitamin B12]] shots to Hutton and take care of him so the band could continue touring. For the albums [[Cyan (Three Dog Night album)|''Cyan'']], [[Hard Labor|''Hard Labor'']], and [[Coming Down Your Way|''Coming Down Your Way'']], Hutton did not show up for many of the recording sessions and would be present only long enough to record one song. Cory Wells became fed up with his frequent absence and Hutton was fired from the band in late 1975. He was replaced by [[Jay Gruska]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUGa7jP1MNM |title=Chuck Negron Michael Artsis Show Interview|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref>

Hours before the first concert of their 1975 tour, [[Chuck Negron]] was arrested for the possession of narcotics but was soon released on $10,000 bond.<ref>Wirephoto, A. P. "Arrested just before Concert Tour." ''Chicago Tribune'', Jul 4, 1975, p. 5.</ref>

''[[Coming Down Your Way]]'', released in May 1975, failed to sell well in the United States, likely due to poor promotion on account of the bands recently switched label, [[ABC Records|ABC]], and the growing popularity of [[disco]] music. Disappointed by this, the band decided "[[Til the World Ends (Three Dog Night song)|Til The World Ends]]" would be the only single released off the album, which ended up being the group's last [[Billboard Hot 100]] Top 40 hit.

Jay Gruska toured with the band to promote their last album, ''[[American Pastime]]'', released in March 1976. Still, the album did not sell well for the same reasons as before. However, the only single released off the album, "[[Everybody's a Masterpiece]]" became an [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]] hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/three-dog-night/chart-history/adult-contemporary |title=Three Dog Night Chart History – Adult Contemporary|access-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/three-dog-night/chart-history/billboard-200|title=Three Dog Night Chart History – Billboard 200|access-date=December 13, 2018}}</ref> Another former Rufus band member, Ron Stockert, was recruited as second keyboardist after Konte left in the first half of 1976. The group played their final show at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theatre]] in Los Angeles on July 26, 1976.<ref name="auto"/>

===1981–1990s===
In 1981, Three Dog Night reunited and released the [[ska]]-inspired ''[[It's a Jungle]]'' in 1983 on the small [[Passport Records]] label, which garnered some airplay on the [[New wave music|new wave]] circuit. The EP failed to sell after Passport went bankrupt. The reunion featured all of the original members, except [[Joe Schermie]], who was succeeded by Mike Seifrit until 1982, and then by Richard Grossman, who stayed until 1984. Two guitarists, Paul Kingery and Steve Ezzo, occasionally played with the band, filling in for Allsup on dates he was not able to make between 1982 and 1984. Ezzo replaced Allsup when he departed in late 1984 to take care of some personal and family matters. Sneed was let go from the band at the same time. In early 1985, keyboardist Rick Seratte (formerly of [[Poco]] and later with [[Whitesnake]] and others) filled in for Greenspoon, who was ill, and the band hit the road with a revised lineup that included Seratte, Steve Ezzo, bassist Scott Manzo and drummer Mike Keeley.<ref name="auto"/> The band toured all through 1985, but in late '85, Negron was forced back into rehab. Seratte left the band to pursue other offers and Greenspoon rejoined the band with Negron in late 1985 and were back touring with the group.

By December 1985, after a relapse into his drug habit, Negron was let go, and the group continued with Wells and Hutton fronting the band and Paul Kingery was brought back on guitar to cover Chuck's vocal harmonies. In 1986, their song "In My Heart" was featured in ''[[Robotech: The Movie]]''.

More changes in personnel occurred when guitarist T. J. Parker and vocalist and bassist Gary Moon replaced Kingery and Manzo in 1988, and were replaced themselves by Mike Cuneo and [[Richard Campbell (musician)|Richard Campbell]] during 1989.

Allsup returned to the group to replace Cuneo in the spring of 1991. Negron entered drug rehab, but did not return to the band.

Pat Bautz succeeded Keeley as drummer in 1993.

In 1993, Three Dog Night performed for [[Television networks preceding ABC Family|The Family Channel]] show ''Spotlight on Country'', filmed in [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina]]. Kingery returned to the band as their bass player in 1996 following Campbell's departure.

===2000–2012===
Original bassist Joe Schermie died on March 26, 2002. In May 2002 the band released ''Three Dog Night with The London Symphony Orchestra''. The album was recorded in Los Angeles and in London at Abbey Road Studios and includes two new songs: "Overground" and "Sault Ste. Marie". They also released a DVD of a filmed symphony performance from 2000 titled ''Three Dog Night Live With the Tennessee Symphony Orchestra'' in May 2002.  In the summer of 2004, 80s bassist Scott Manzo returned briefly to fill in for Paul Kingery.

In October 2004, Three Dog Night released ''The 35th Anniversary Hits Collection Featuring The London Symphony Orchestra''. The album includes live versions of "Eli's Coming", "Brickyard Blues", "Try a Little Tenderness", and "Family of Man". In August 2008, they released ''Three Dog Night Greatest Hits Live'', a compilation of previously unissued live recordings from concerts in [[Frankfurt, Germany]] and [[Edmonton, London]] in 1972 and 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/419568/three+dog+night/chart |title=Three Dog Night – Chart history |work=Billboard |access-date=March 12, 2015}}</ref> On October 24, 2009, they released three new songs: "Heart of Blues", "Prayer of the Children", and "Two Lights In The Nighttime". They issued two new songs on their ''35th Anniversary Hits Collection Featuring The London Symphony Orchestra''.

===2012–present===
In the summer of 2012, guitarist Allsup was hospitalized for an intestinal disorder, forcing Kingery to move back to guitar, while Danny's son Timothy Hutton played bass. This happened again during the summer of 2015 when Allsup was forced to miss some shows.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}} On March 11, 2015, Jimmy Greenspoon died from cancer, aged 67.

On October 21, 2015, Cory Wells died at his home in Dunkirk, New York at age 74. In November 2015, the band announced that singer David Morgan would be joining them on the road. He was a member of [[the Association]]. In April 2017, Howard Laravea replaced Eddie Reasoner on keyboards. He was formerly with [[Frankie Valli]] and [[The Four Seasons (band)|the Four Seasons]].
