'''Danger, Inc.''' was a company specializing in hardware design, software, and services for [[mobile computing]] devices. Its most notable product was the [[T-Mobile]] [[T-Mobile Sidekick|Sidekick]] (also known as [[Danger Hiptop]]), a popular early smartphone. The Sidekick or Hiptop was an early example of [[client–server model|client–server]] ("cloud"-based) smartphones and created the App (Applications) marketplace, later popularized by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and [[iOS]]. Danger was acquired by [[Microsoft]] on 11 February 2008, for a price rumored to be around $500 million (USD).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gigaom.com/2008/02/12/how-much-did-microsoft-pay-for-danger-find-out-here/ |title=How Much Did Microsoft Pay For Danger? |date=12 February 2008 |publisher=[[Gigaom]] }}</ref>

==History==
The company was originally started by former [[Apple Inc.]], [[WebTV Networks|WebTV]] and [[Philips]] employees [[Andy Rubin]], Joe Britt, and Matt Hershenson. Co-founder Andy Rubin left in 2003 to create the company [[Android Inc.#History|Android]], which was later acquired by [[Google]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.fr/us/how-android-was-created-2015-3/|title=THE RISE OF ANDROID: How a flailing startup became the world's biggest computing platform|website=Business Insider France|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref>

After the Microsoft acquisition in 2008, the former Danger staff were absorbed into the Mobile Communications Business (MCB) of the Microsoft Entertainment and Devices Division, where they worked on a future mobile phone platform known as "Project Pink" which would eventually be released as [[Microsoft Kin|Kin]].<ref name=Channel_Struggles>{{cite news

By October 2009, most of the ex-Danger employees had left Microsoft.<ref name=Betanews>{{cite news |title=The Sidekick catastrophe: A curse for Microsoft, but a blessing for Motorola? |newspaper=Betanews |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/The-Sidekick-catastrophe-A-curse-for-Microsoft-but-a-blessing-for-Motorola/1255361704 }}</ref> Until March 2013, Rubin headed Android development, and brought former Danger Director of Design [[Matias Duarte]] to Google.

=== October 2009 data loss ===
{{main|2009 Sidekick data loss}}
In early October 2009, a server malfunction or technician error at Danger's data centers resulted in the loss of all Sidekick user data.  As Sidekicks store users' data on Danger's servers—versus using local storage—users lost contact directories, calendars, photos, and all other media not locally backed up. Local backup could be accomplished through an app ($9.99 USD) which synchronized contacts, calendar, and tasks, but not notes, between the web and a local Windows PC. In an October 10 letter to subscribers, Microsoft expressed its doubt that any data would be recovered.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/10/t-mobile-sidekick-disaster-microsofts-servers-crashed-and-they-dont-have-a-backup/ |title=T-Mobile Sidekick Disaster: Danger's Servers Crashed, And They Don't Have A Backup |work=TechCrunch |date=2009-10-10 |access-date=2013-06-14}}</ref>

The customer's data that was lost was, at the time, being hosted in Microsoft's data centers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Danger no backups |newspaper=[[The Inquirer]] |date=12 October 2009 |url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1558214/danger-backups |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013153615/http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1558214/danger-backups |url-status=unfit |archive-date=October 13, 2009 }}</ref> Some media reports have suggested that Microsoft hired [[Hitachi]] to perform an upgrade to its [[storage area network]] (SAN), when something went wrong, resulting in data destruction.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sidekick failure rumors point fingers at outsourcing, lack of backups |newspaper=[[engadget]] |date=11 October 2009 |url=https://www.engadget.com/2009/10/11/sidekick-failure-rumors-point-fingers-at-outsourcing-lack-of-ba/ }}</ref> Microsoft did not have an active backup of the data and it had to be restored from a month-old copy of the server data, totalling 800GB in size, from offsite backup tapes. The entire restoration of data took over 2 months for customer data and full functionality to be restored.<ref>{{cite news |title= Microsoft's Danger Problem Blamed on Management |newspaper=RoughlyDrafted |date=15 October 2009 |url=http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2009/10/15/microsofts-pinkdanger-backup-problem-blamed-on-roz-ho/ }}</ref>
