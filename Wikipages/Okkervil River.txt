'''Okkervil River''' is an American rock band led by singer-songwriter [[Will Sheff]]. Formed in [[Austin, Texas]], in 1998, the band takes its name from a short story by Russian author [[Tatyana Tolstaya]]{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}} set on the river [[Okkervil]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. They began as a trio made up of Sheff and friends he had met in his native state of [[New Hampshire]] but, over time, have gone through many lineups.

Okkervil River self-released their first album, ''Stars Too Small to Use,'' which led them to the [[South by Southwest]] music festival. After recording their first album in a garage, they signed with [[Jagjaguwar]]. They continued by releasing four more albums, including the critically lauded concept album ''[[Black Sheep Boy]]''.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/feature/-/593175 | title = Best of 2005 List | website=Amazon.com|access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>

After a period of touring for ''Black Sheep Boy'', Okkervil River followed up with ''[[The Stage Names]]''. The album sold 10,000 in its opening week in the United States. The group released a free covers album, ''[[Golden Opportunities Mixtape]]'' from their live performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/44736-okkervil-river-release-free-covers-ep/|title = Okkervil River Release Free Covers EP|date = November 28, 2011}}</ref>

The band has garnered positive critical reception.<ref>{{cite web|author=Andrew Leahey |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/okkervil-river-mn0000460390/biography |title=Okkervil River &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>
They have appeared on the talk show ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' and have performed with acts such as [[The Decemberists]], [[The New Pornographers]], [[The National (band)|The National]], and [[Lou Reed]].

Okkervil River released the album ''[[The Stand Ins]]'' in 2008. They promoted the release with a series of cover songs from the album on [[YouTube]] by people they've met as a band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/OkkervilRiver |title=Kanaal van OkkervilRiver |publisher=YouTube |date=September 18, 2008 |access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> Their 2010 collaboration as a backing band with psychedelic rocker [[Roky Erickson]] yielded ''[[True Love Cast Out All Evil]]''. In 2011, Okkervil River released their sixth full-length album, ''[[I Am Very Far]]'', which peaked at No. 32 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band released their seventh album, ''[[The Silver Gymnasium]]'', in 2013. The album peaked at No. 66 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. This was followed by the album, ''[[Away (Okkervil River album)|Away]],'' which was released in 2016 on [[ATO Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atorecords.com/featured/okkervil-river-announces-new-album-away-tour-listen-to-okkervil-rip-at-pitchfork/|title=Okkervil River Announces New Album 'Away' + Tour – Listen to "Okkervil RIP" at Pitchfork – ATO RECORDS|website=Atorecords.com|date=May 18, 2016|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref> Their ninth album, [[In the Rainbow Rain]], was released by ATO in 2018.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
[[File:Okkervil River Scott Brackett.jpg|thumb|Scott Brackett playing trumpet at the 2007 Fun Fun Fest in Austin, Texas]]
Okkervil River's founding members became friends at [[Kimball Union Academy]] in [[Meriden, New Hampshire]], and after parting ways for college moved to Austin, Texas to live together and start a band. The band consisted of singer-songwriter [[Will Sheff]], Zach Thomas on bass and mandolin, and Seth Warren on drums. Their first gig was at Steamboat in Austin on January 11, 1999.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:76071 |title=Okkervil River: The New Sincerity – Music |newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref>

=== ''Bedroom EP'' and ''Stars Too Small to Use'' ===
In 1998, the group self-released their first disc, ''Bedroom EP''. Over the course of two weekends in the summer of 1999, they recorded a seven-song self-released album titled ''[[Stars Too Small to Use]]'', with recording engineer Jeff Hoskins.

They met [[Jonathan Meiburg]] at a gig with his band Whu Gnu at the Waterloo Brewing Company on December 3, 1999. Meiburg subsequently joined the band on accordion and later on pianos and organs.

On the strength of ''Stars Too Small to Use'', Okkervil River was admitted into the 2000 [[SXSW]] music festival. Their first major press was a SXSW feature article<ref>{{cite news|last=Messer |first=Kate X |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid%3A76071 |title=Okkervil River: The New Sincerity – Music |newspaper=[[The Austin Chronicle]] |date=March 3, 2000 |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref> in the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'' on March 3, 2000.

=== ''Don't Fall in Love with Everyone You See'' and ''Down the River of Golden Dreams'' ===
[[File:Okkervil river2.jpg|upright=0.8|Okkervil guitarist Brian Cassidy at Fun Fun Fun fest in 2007|thumb]]
The band met recording engineer and producer Brian Beattie at their SXSW showcase on March 18, 2000, and soon agreed to make a record together. They spent much of the rest of that year working on ''[[Don't Fall in Love with Everyone You See]]''. Warren moved to [[Berkeley, California]] in December and was replaced on drums by Mark Pedini.

By the time of that year's SXSW festival, Okkervil River had received interest in their new record from the [[Bloomington, Indiana]]-based record label [[Jagjaguwar]]. The record was released on Jagjaguwar on January 22, 2002.

One year later the band traveled to San Francisco and reunited with Warren to record their third album at Tiny Telephone with engineer [[Scott Solter]] at the console. Jagjaguwar released ''[[Down the River of Golden Dreams]]'' on September 2, 2003.

In 2003, Pedini left the band to pursue his [[graphic design]] work, leaving Okkervil River without a drummer for that year's SXSW. They invited [[Travis Nelsen]], fresh off a tour filling in on drums for sister labelmates [[Secretly Canadian]]'s [[Swearing at Motorists]], to perform with them. He soon became the band's full-time drummer. The next year, during a long bout of touring, the band added keyboardist and lap-steel player Howard Draper as a fifth member.

In August 2004, the band began recording with Beattie again, finally putting the finishing touches on their third full-length album, ''[[Black Sheep Boy]]'' in November. It was released on April 5, 2005. As a result of the album's critical success, Okkervil River followed up with an [[extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[Black Sheep Boy Appendix]]'' on November 22, 2005. This was the first recording with Draper, horn and keyboardist Scott Brackett, guitarist Brian Cassidy, and touring bassist Pat Pestorius, who eventually replaced Zach Thomas in the band. The band signed to [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]/[[EMI]] in Europe and the label re-released ''[[Black Sheep Boy]]'' and its follow-up ''[[Black Sheep Boy Appendix]]'' as a double disc on April 28, 2006. Jagjaguwar eventually followed suit, releasing the ''Definitive Edition'' with extra songs and videos.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jagjaguwar.com/onesheet.php?cat=JAG120 |title=JAG120 |website=Jagjaguwar.com |date=March 6, 2007 |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>

''[[The Stage Names]]'', their fourth full-length studio album (produced again by Beattie), was released on August 7, 2007. The disc features the line-up that toured extensively on ''Black Sheep Boy'' and the ''Black Sheep Boy Appendix'', with Cassidy replacing Draper who joined [[Shearwater (band)|Shearwater]]. The album was met with critical acclaim<ref name="metacritic">{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/okkervilriver/stagenames?q=stage%20names |title=The Stage Names |website=Metacritic.com |access-date=August 15, 2007}}</ref> and debuted at number 62 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with 10,000 copies sold.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1049874/after-five-year-absence-ugk-scores-first-no-1-album |title=After Five-Year Absence, UGK Scores First No.&nbsp;1 Album |date=August 15, 2007 |website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

Okkervil River released their fifth album ''[[The Stand Ins]]'' on September 9, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50828-new-okkervil-river-album-due-in-september |title=New Okkervil River Album Due in September |date=May 22, 2008 |access-date=May 22, 2008 |publisher=Pitchfork Media |author=Paul Thompson |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525202553/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/50828-new-okkervil-river-album-due-in-september |archive-date=May 25, 2008 }}</ref> In its first week, the album charted at No.&nbsp;42 with 11,000 copies sold, according to the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044058/metallica-scores-fifth-straight-no-1-album |title=Metallica Scores Fifth Straight No.&nbsp;1 Album |date=September 17, 2008 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> On December 12, 2007, the band freely released a nine-song [[mixtape]] entitled ''[[Golden Opportunities Mixtape]]'' via their website.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/47584-okkervil-river-golden-opportunities-mixtape-mp3 |title=New Music: Okkervil River: Golden Opportunities Mixtape [MP3] |website=Pitchforkmedia.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081021041314/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/download/47584-okkervil-river-golden-opportunities-mixtape-mp3 |archive-date=October 21, 2008 }}</ref> These recordings, along with the upcoming appendix, are the first to feature contributions from new touring keyboardist, Justin Sherburn, who joined the band in November 2007.

In 2008 guitarist Brian Cassidy stepped down from the band as a full-time touring member and was temporarily replaced by Charles Bissell of [[The Wrens (band)|The Wrens]] for their spring and summer tours.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/49255-the-wrens-charles-bissell-joins-okkervil-river |title=Pitchfork: The Wrens' Charles Bissell Joins Okkervil River |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=March 12, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316042312/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/49255-the-wrens-charles-bissell-joins-okkervil-river |archive-date=March 16, 2008 }}</ref> Bissell was later replaced by Lauren Gurgiolo, singer and songwriter of the Austin, Texas band The Dialtones. After performing on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' in early 2009, the "Pop Lie" single was released backed with the b-sides "Millionaire" and "Pop Lie (One Man Band Version)".

=== ''I Am Very Far'' & ''The Silver Gymnasium'' ===
[[File:Will Sheff 2008.jpg|thumb|[[Will Sheff]], lead singer and songwriter (2008)]]
Okkervil River's sixth album, ''[[I Am Very Far]]'', was released on May 10, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/41491-okkervil-rivers-will-sheff-talks-new-album-ii-am-very-fari-shares-new-non-lp-track-mermaid/ |title=Okkervil River's Will Sheff Talks New Album I Am Very Far, Shares New Non-LP Track "Mermaid" |website=Pitchfork |date=February 8, 2011 |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref> To promote the album, the band went on tour in 2011 with [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]], [[Julianna Barwick]], [[Future Islands]] and NewVillager.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/41713-okkervil-river-tour-with-titus-andronicus/ |title=Okkervil River Tour With Titus Andronicus &#124; News |website=Pitchfork |date=March 1, 2011 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> In September 2013 Okkervil River released their seventh album, ''[[The Silver Gymnasium]]'', the content of which is inspired by Sheff's childhood and hometown.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/sound-of-silver-will-sheff-x-william-schaff |title=Sound of Silver: Will Sheff x William Schaff – Page |magazine=Interview Magazine |date=September 29, 2015 |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== ''Away'' ===
[[File:Will Scheff (okkervil river).jpg|thumb|Will Sheff (Okkervil river)]]
''[[Away (Okkervil River album)|Away]]'', the band's eighth album, was released on September 9, 2016. The album features a new backing band and sonic direction, including contributions from Marissa Nadler, Jonathan Meiburg and members of the classical group yMusic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/65547-okkervil-river-announce-new-album-away-share-new-song-okkervil-river-rip-listen/|title=Okkervil River Announce New Album Away, Share New Song 'Okkervil River R.I.P.': Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|date=May 18, 2016|access-date=June 13, 2016}}</ref> The content of the album is largely based on Will Sheff's life during the 2013–2015 period after the release of The Silver Gymnasium, during which many members of the band left and his grandfather died.

=== ''In the Rainbow Rain'' ===
''[[In the Rainbow Rain]]'' was released on April 27, 2018, and marks the ninth album for the band. Will Sheff produced the album while [[Shawn Everett]] (Perfume Genius, Alabama Shakes, The War on Drugs) assumed mixing responsibilities.
The writing process incorporated Sheff's songwriting craftsmanship with an interplay of his new bandmates, [[Benjamin Lazar Davis]] (bass), Will Graefe (guitar), Lip Talk (Sarah K. Pedinotti) (keys) and Cully Symington (percussion) – the same iteration of Okkervil River that joined Sheff on the Away tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atorecords.com/featured/new-okkervil-river-album-in-the-rainbow-rain-out-now/|title=New Okkervil River Album 'In The Rainbow Rain' Out {{!}} ATO Records|website=atorecords.com|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref>

Sheff and the band started work on the new album shortly after the end of that tour – and the presidential election. "If December 2016 was good for anything, it was good for writing songs", he said. Sheff took a different approach to the album, sometimes co-writing with his new band, and occasionally attending local Quaker meetings.

[[File:Okkervil river1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jonathan Meiburg]], former Okkervil River member, at a festival in 2006]]
{{Main|Shearwater (band)}}
In 2001, Meiburg and Sheff founded a second band known as [[Shearwater (band)|Shearwater]]. Originally an outlet for Meiburg songs and some Sheff songs that didn't fit the Okkervil mold, Shearwater has gradually evolved into a full-fledged band. The band's 2006 release, ''[[Palo Santo (Shearwater album)|Palo Santo]]'' (sans Sheff's vocals, but including his musical input), has seen Meiburg receive great critical acclaim. The groups still share many fans, and, while on tour together in 2004, they released a limited edition split-CD entitled ''[[Sham Wedding/Hoax Funeral]]''. In 2008, Meiburg left Okkervil River to focus exclusively on Shearwater.

On April 20, 2010, former [[13th Floor Elevators]] singer-guitarist [[Roky Erickson]] released the album ''True Love Cast Out All Evil'', produced by Will Sheff and backed by Okkervil River.

Okkervil River also performed "[[Candle on the Water]]" for the 2016 remake of "[[Pete's Dragon (2016 film)|Pete's Dragon]]".<ref>{{cite web|author=Kate Erbland |url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/petes-dragon-walt-disney-records-soundtrack-1201708121/ |title=Pete's Dragon Announces Massive Walt Disney Records Issued Soundtrack |website=IndieWire.com |date=July 21, 2016 |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>
