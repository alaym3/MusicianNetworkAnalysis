==Life and career==
Fero was born on 25 February 1991 in [[Bonn]], Germany. His father is from [[Trabzon]], and his mother is from [[Sivas]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.cnnturk.com/magazin/ben-fero-kimdir-kac-yasinda-gercek-adi-ne | title = Ben Fero kimdir, kaç yaşında, gerçek adı ne? | date = 3 April 2019 | publisher = cnnturk.com | accessdate = 5 June 2019 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190605172700/https://www.cnnturk.com/magazin/ben-fero-kimdir-kac-yasinda-gercek-adi-ne | archivedate = 5 June 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> In 1994, he returned to Turkey with his family and settled in [[İzmir]]. At the age of 8, he became familiar with rap by listening to [[Tupac Shakur]]. Ben Fero studied at [[Sabancı University|Sabanci University]] between 2005 and 2010. In April 2018, his first song, "Mahallemiz Esmer" was released. After releasing another single, "Kimlerdensin", in August 2018, he decided to leave his job as a sales manager in a private company and focus on music.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.mynet.com/rap-muzigin-hizla-yukselen-ismi-ben-fero-190101142726 | title = RAP müziğin hızla yükselen ismi 'Ben Fero' | date = 2 March 2019 | publisher = mynet.com | accessdate = 31 March 2019 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20190331192735/https://www.mynet.com/rap-muzigin-hizla-yukselen-ismi-ben-fero-190101142726 | archivedate = 31 March 2019 | url-status = live }}</ref> He is reportedly close to [[Ezhel]] and YouTuber [[Berkcan Güven]], and this made it easier for him to make himself known in the music market.
