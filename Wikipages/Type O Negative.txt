==History==
===Origins (1980s–1991)===
Former [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]] frontman Peter Steele,<ref>{{cite web |last=Stingley |first=Mick |date=April 15, 2010 |title=Type O Negative Frontman Peter Steele Dies |website=Billboard.com |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958602/type-o-negative-frontman-peter-steele-dies |access-date=April 22, 2013 |quote=Born in 1962, Steele played in a number of hardcore bands around his native Brooklyn before starting Carnivore,...}}</ref> along with childhood friends Sal Abruscato, Josh Silver, and Kenny Hickey, formed Type O Negative and signed to [[Roadrunner Records]]. Shortly after signing in 1991 the band released their debut, ''[[Slow, Deep and Hard]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stingley |first=Mick |date=April 15, 2010 |title=Type O Negative Frontman Peter Steele Dies |website=Billboard.com |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/958602/type-o-negative-frontman-peter-steele-dies |access-date=April 22, 2013 |quote=Their first release, 'Slow, Deep And Hard' (1991, RoadRunner) was notable for both its long dirges and thrash breaks, and dark, humorous lyrics.}}</ref>

===''Slow, Deep and Hard'' and ''The Origin of the Feces'' (1991–1992)===
Type O Negative's first album, ''[[Slow, Deep and Hard]]'',<ref>{{cite web |date=April 20, 2011 |title=Yahoo Music - Exclusive New Music and Music Videos |website=Music.yahoo.com |url=http://music.yahoo.com/type-o-negative/albums/slow-deep-and-hard--69541 |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> incorporated dragging [[Black Sabbath]]-esque [[dirge]] [[riff]]s, maniacal hardcore outbursts, and droning industrial and gothic atmospheres. The songs were long, multi-part theatrical epics, with lyrics loosely surrounding a story involving a man enacting revenge on a cheating girlfriend before ultimately contemplating his actions and committing suicide.

They began creating a new album that was supposed to be live. The subsequent 1992 album was entitled ''[[The Origin of the Feces]]'' and a [[warning label]] was put on the album cover: "Not Live at Brighton Beach".<ref>{{cite web |title=Type O Negative - The Origin of the Feces (Not Live at Brighton Beach) - Reviews - Encyclopaedia Metallum |website=Metal-archives.com|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Type_O_Negative/The_Origin_of_the_Feces_(Not_Live_at_Brighton_Beach)/4108/ |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> The album contains faux-live recordings of songs from ''Slow, Deep and Hard'', as well as previously unreleased songs such as "Are You Afraid" and "Hey Pete" (a cover of [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Hey Joe]]" with altered lyrics) and Black Sabbath's "[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]".

===''Bloody Kisses'' and ''October Rust'' (1993–1998)===
Type O Negative's third album, ''[[Bloody Kisses]]'', was released in 1993 to critical and listener acclaim, and eventually became the first record for Roadrunner to reach certified [[Platinum album|platinum]] status in the US.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=April 15, 2010 |title=Type O Negative Singer Peter Steele Dead at 48 |website=Rollingstone.com |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/type-o-negative-singer-peter-steele-dead-at-48-20100415 |access-date=August 27, 2012 |quote=Type O Negative became one of the most unlikely bands to break into the mainstream in the 1990s with their third album ''Bloody Kisses'', which became the first album released by Roadrunner Records to go platinum.}}</ref>

''Bloody Kisses'' mostly addressed loneliness and heartbreak, with songs like "Too Late: Frozen", "Blood & Fire" and "Can't Lose You". The [[organ (music)|organ]]-driven "Set Me on Fire" is vintage 1960s [[garage rock]], while "[[Summer Breeze (song)#Type O Negative version|Summer Breeze]]" covered the 1972 [[Seals and Crofts]] hit. "[[Christian Woman]]" and "[[Black No. 1 (Little Miss Scare-All)]]" became the most popular tracks, after having been edited down to radio-friendly lengths (the album versions were 9 and 11 minutes long respectively). In order to promote the album, Type O Negative embarked on a two-year world tour. During this time, the band was featured on [[MTV]], [[VH1]], and in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. In the midst of this media blitz, drummer [[Sal Abruscato]] quit the band to join another Brooklyn quartet, [[Life of Agony]]. [[Johnny Kelly]], the band's drum technician, was therefore hired as a full-fledged member. ''Bloody Kisses'' was re-released a year after the original release in a limited-edition [[Digipak]] form, including eight of the musical tracks from the original (omitting the "filler" tracks) and the previously unreleased "Suspended in Dusk".

Type O's ''[[October Rust]]'' picked up where ''Bloody Kisses'' left off, exploring themes of sex, nature and sensuality, first in a humorous sense on the single "[[My Girlfriend's Girlfriend]]" and then taken much darker with "Love You to Death". This record also saw a cover of [[Neil Young]]'s "Cinnamon Girl" as well as the fan favorite, semi-serene "Green Man". While not quite as successful as ''Bloody Kisses'', the album was certified [[Gold album|gold]]<ref>{{cite news|date=February 4, 1997 |title=Type O Negative flows into central Iowa - Iowa State Daily: Home |newspaper=[[Iowa State Daily]] |url=http://www.iowastatedaily.com/article_ffb3be31-35f4-50c1-9b1d-fb8eaf82a3cc.html |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> in the US, and was the first Type O Negative album to enter the top half of the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Top 200]], debuting at No. 42.

===''World Coming Down'' and ''The Least Worst of Type O Negative'' (1999–2001)===
With the completion of another successful world tour, writing for a fifth album began. In the period immediately following the release of ''October Rust'', resulting in 1999's ''[[World Coming Down]]'' (working titles included ''Prophets of Doom'' and ''Aggroculture'').''World Coming Down'' debuted at No. 39 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard Top 200]] charts. ''World Coming Down'' featured a much darker, bleak tone than its predecessors,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2015/09/22/remembering-world-coming-fall-type-o-negative/|title=Remembering World Coming Down: The Fall of Type O Negative|date=September 22, 2015|website=Metalsucks.net}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/26519/Type-O-Negative-World-Coming-Down/|title=Type O Negative - World Coming Down (album review 3) |website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=November 26, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ninecircles.co/2015/09/30/retrospective-type-o-negative-world-coming-down/|title=Retrospective: Type O Negative – "World Coming Down"|date=September 30, 2015|website=Ninecircles.co}}</ref> having been written after a series of deaths in frontman [[Peter Steele]]'s family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://typeonegative.rockmetal.art.pl/wyw/eng/enwpeteroutburn.html|title=# TYPE O NEGATIVE # Interview with...

A [[best of]] album followed in 2000, entitled ''[[Least Worst Of|The Least Worst of Type O Negative]].'' Although most songs appear on previous albums, many are unreleased [[remixes]] or [[B-sides]] of previously released singles. Along with these songs are some unreleased numbers from the ''World Coming Down'' sessions, the band's cover of [[Black Sabbath (song)|"Black Sabbath"]] by [[Black Sabbath]] (Peter Steele's version with different lyrics, written from the perspective of Satan), and a cleaner version of "Hey Pete" (originally released on the mock live album ''The Origin of the Feces'').

===''Life Is Killing Me'' and ''Dead Again'' (2002–2009)===
Type O Negative's sixth studio album, ''[[Life Is Killing Me]]'' (originally called ''The Dream Is Dead'' after the closing song), was released in 2003.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |date=April 15, 2010 |title=Peter Steele Of Type O Negative: A Remembrance, Frontman's dark image belied his friendly, humorous personality. |website=Mtv.com |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1637149/peter-steele-type-o-negative-remembrance.jhtml |access-date=August 22, 2012 |quote=In 2003, Type O Negative released what turned out to be their penultimate album, ''Life Is Killing Me''.}}</ref> For this album, the band picked up the pace of their sound from the dirgeful slowness of ''World Coming Down''. Songs such as "Todd's Ship Gods (Above All Things)", "(We Were) Electrocute", and "I Don't Wanna Be Me" convey the band's classic elements of melody, though the song lengths were much shorter on this outing, the longest being the 7 and a half-minute "How Could She?", a list of female character names from television shows. The album includes a humorous cover of the song "Angry Inch" from the musical ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]],'' detailing a [[sex change operation]] gone terribly wrong.

Type O then left Roadrunner for [[SPV GmbH|SPV Records]] and released ''[[Dead Again (Type O Negative album)|Dead Again]]'' in 2007. ''Dead Again'' debuted at No. 27 in the United States,<ref>{{cite web |title=Type O Negative Billboard Chart History |url={{BillboardURLbyName |artist=type o negative |chart=all}} |work=Billboard |access-date=September 7, 2013}}</ref> the band's highest chart debut to date.

{{cquote|It is with great sadness that we inform you that Type O Negative front man, bassist, and our band mate, Peter Steele passed away last night of what appears to be heart failure. Ironically Peter had been enjoying a long period of [[sobriety]] and improved health and was imminently due to begin writing and recording new music for our follow up to "[[Dead Again (Type O Negative album)|Dead Again]]" released in 2007.
The official cause of death has yet to be determined pending autopsy results. The funeral services will be private and memorial services will be announced at a future date. We’d like to share our thoughts and those of Peter's family below.
We are truly saddened to lose our friend and appreciate the tremendous outpouring today from around the world.

Sincerely,<br />

==Soundtracks and covers==
{{more citations needed section|date=November 2017}}
Type O Negative's songs have appeared in numerous motion pictures, including "Blood and Fire (Out of the Ashes Remix)" on the 1995 ''[[Mortal Kombat (1995 film)|Mortal Kombat]]'' movie soundtrack (also on the bonus CD of ''Life Is Killing Me''), "Love You to Death" in ''[[Bride of Chucky]],'' "Everyone I Love Is Dead" in ''[[Faust: Love of the Damned]]'', "(We Were) Electrocute" in ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]],'' and "[[Summer Breeze (song)|Summer Breeze]]" in ''[[I Know What You Did Last Summer]]''. As a result of [[Howard Stern]] being a self-professed fan, ''[[Private Parts: The Album]]'' contains "[[Pictures of Matchstick Men]]" with the band playing music and [[Ozzy Osbourne]] on vocals. "Haunted" also appears on ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' "soundtrack CD" (the album's concept was to contain songs from "a tape that was found in the woods with the students' gear"). In 1998, Arrow Videos made their own version of the 1922 classic horror film ''[[Nosferatu]]'', by simply overdubbing the [[silent film]] with a soundtrack consisting entirely of Type O Negative tracks, taken from the first four albums. This version is now on DVD from DigiView Entertainment, a company that makes budget-priced DVDs. It also has an introduction by actor [[David Carradine]].

In other media, the computer game ''[[Descent (video game)#Sequels|Descent 2]]'' features a shortened, instrumental version of the track "Haunted". Additionally, ''[[Descent II#Descent II: The Vertigo Series (1996)|Descent 2: The Vertigo Series]]'' contains a full-length version of the instrumental; the compilation ''Duke Nukem: Music to Score By'' features "Cinnamon Girl (Extended Depression Mix)"; "Love You to Death" in the computer game ''[[Blood (video game)|Blood]]''; "Out of the Fire" from the ''Life is Killing Me'' bonus CD was a theme created for wrestler [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]], but was never used. The opening two seconds of "I Don't Wanna Be Me" were used as a frequent sample in ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]],'' on the Liberty Rock Radio Station, and 2012 video game ''[[The Darkness II]]'' features Type O Negative's "[[Black No. 1]]" in its multiplayer lobby, played at random amongst other songs.

Type O Negative performed and recorded numerous covers. [[The Doors]]' "[[Light My Fire]]" has been covered live numerous times, mostly during the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |title=Type O Negative – Light My Fire |publisher=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjncGxnp-Yc |access-date=March 18, 2010}}</ref> Steele has described the song as "probably the greatest song ever written" before apologizing for having "destroyed it". [[Seals and Crofts]]' "[[Summer Breeze (song)|Summer Breeze]]" appears on ''[[Bloody Kisses]]'', and [[Neil Young]]'s "[[Cinnamon Girl (Neil Young song)|Cinnamon Girl]]" appears on ''[[October Rust]]''. The tongue-in-cheek "Angry Inch" (from ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'') appears on ''[[Life is Killing Me]]''. ''[[World Coming Down]]'' includes a Beatles [[medley (music)|medley]] consisting of "[[Day Tripper]]", "[[If I Needed Someone]]", and "[[I Want You (She's So Heavy)]]". Other covers include a rendition of [[Black Sabbath]]'s "[[Paranoid (Black Sabbath song)|Paranoid]]" and "N.I.B."; [[Status Quo (band)|Status Quo]]'s "[[Pictures of Matchstick Men]]" with [[Ozzy Osbourne]], two versions of [[Black Sabbath (song)|"Black Sabbath"]] (one with the original lyrics and one rewritten by Peter Steele to be from Satan's perspective), [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Hey Joe]]" (rewritten as "Hey Pete"); [[the Beatles]]' "[[Back in the U.S.S.R.]]", [[Deep Purple]]'s "[[Highway Star (song)|Highway Star]]", [[Queen (band)|Queen's]] "[[One Vision]]", and [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]'s "[[Bad Moon Rising (song)|Bad Moon Rising]]". A medley of [[Santana (band)|Santana]]'s "Evil Ways", "Oye Como Va", and "[[Black Magic Woman]]" are also available on the CD accompanying the DVD ''Symphony for the Devil''. The 2007 tour song set started with a cover of "[[Magical Mystery Tour (song)|Magical Mystery Tour]]" from the Beatles.

"[[In the Flesh?|In the Flesh]]", originally written by [[Pink Floyd]] from their album ''The Wall'', is another song that Type O Negative covered, used to open their 1999 World Tour. This version can be seen on the live DVD, ''Symphony for the Devil''. Also on the same DVD, in "Too Late: Frozen", the intro began with Jethro Tull's "Aqualung".
