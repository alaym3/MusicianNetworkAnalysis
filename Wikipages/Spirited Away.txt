==Plot==

<!-- PER WP:FILMPLOT, PLOT SUMMARIES IN FILM ARTICLES SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS. -->
Ten-year-old Chihiro and her parents are traveling to their new home. Her father, a man who loves to take shortcuts, ends up in front of a tunnel leading to a dry riverbed and, beyond, what appears to be an abandoned village. He conjectures they have stumbled upon a failed theme park, and insists on exploring it despite his daughter's misgivings. The family soon finds an unattended restaurant stall with a suspicious spread of fresh food, which the parents begin to enjoy. Refusing to partake, Chihiro explores on her own and finds an exquisite [[Sentō|bathhouse]] and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro discovers too late that her parents have been transformed into pigs by the cursed food, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.

Haku finds Chihiro again and advises her to ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji. While initially dismissive of Chihiro, Kamaji asks Lin, a bathhouse worker, to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but Chihiro persists, and Yubaba hires her. Yubaba takes away the second [[kanji]] of her name, {{nihongo|Chihiro|千尋}}, renaming her {{nihongo|Sen|千}}. Haku later warns her that if she ever forgets what her birth-name was, like he has forgotten his, she will remain trapped in the spirit world.

Chihiro/Sen, is treated poorly by the other bathhouse workers; only Kamaji and Lin show sympathy for her. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. A "stink spirit" arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic [[Vomiting#Emetics|emetic]] [[dumpling]]. Meanwhile, No-Face, imitating the gold left behind by the stink spirit, tempts a worker with gold and then swallows him. He demands food and begins [[gratuity|tipping]] excessively. He swallows two more workers when they interfere with his conversation with Sen.

Sen sees paper [[Shikigami]] attacking a [[Japanese dragon]] and recognizes the dragon as Haku. When a grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back shapeshifts into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She takes the opportunity to transform Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse and mutates Yubaba's [[harpy]] into a tiny bird. As a decoy she turns Yubaba's three ''[[tsurube-otoshi]]'' into Boh. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden [[Seal (East Asia)|seal]] from her, and warns Sen that it carries a lethal curse. Haku destroys the shikigami, eliminating Zeniba's manifestation. He falls into the boiler room with Sen, Boh, and the harpy, where Sen feeds him part of the dumpling, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.

With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. Sen confronts No-Face, who is now massive, and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, regurgitating everything and everyone he has eaten. Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the harpy travel by train to meet Zeniba. Yubaba orders that Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him ''if'' Yubaba releases Sen and her parents.

Zeniba reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba used the black slug to take control over Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba's home in his dragon form and flies Sen, Boh, and the harpy to the bathhouse. No-Face decides to remain with Zeniba. In mid-flight, Sen recalls an incident from her early childhood in which she fell in the Kohaku River and nearly drowned before she was safely washed ashore. She correctly deduces that Haku is the spirit of the river, breaking the control that Yubaba has over him.

When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her parents from among a group of pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers correctly that none of the pigs are her parents, she is free to go. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to meet her again. Chihiro returns through the tunnel with her parents, who do not remember anything after eating at the restaurant stall. Chihiro looks back at the tunnel, unsure if her adventure really happened. When they reach their car, they find it covered in dust and leaves, but drive off toward their new home.

===Development and inspiration===
{{Quote box|width=30em|align=left|quote="I created a heroine who is an ordinary girl, someone with whom the audience can sympathize [...]. [I]t's not a story in which the characters grow up, but a story in which they draw on something already inside them, brought out by the particular circumstances [...]. I want my young friends to live like that, and I think they, too, have such a wish."|source={{mdash}}Hayao Miyazaki<ref name="nausicaa" />}}
Every summer, [[Hayao Miyazaki]] spent his vacation at a mountain cabin with his family and five girls who were friends of the family. The idea for ''Spirited Away'' came about when he wanted to make a film for these friends. Miyazaki had previously directed films for small children and teenagers such as ''[[My Neighbor Totoro]]'' and ''[[Kiki's Delivery Service]]'', but he had not created a film for ten-year-old girls. For inspiration, he read [[shōjo manga]] magazines like ''[[Nakayoshi]]'' and ''[[Ribon]]'' the girls had left at the cabin, but felt they only offered subjects on "crushes" and romance. When looking at his young friends, Miyazaki felt this was not what they "held dear in their hearts" and decided to produce the film about a young heroine whom they could look up to instead.<ref name="nausicaa">[http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html Miyazaki on Spirited Away // Interviews //] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425061730/http://nausicaa.net/miyazaki/interviews/sen.html |date=25 April 2017 }}.

[[File:Hayao Miyazaki.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=Close up photograph of Hayao Miyazaki, smiling and wearing a suit and tie in front of a gold-colored mosaic.|Hayao Miyazaki used [[shōjo manga]] magazines for inspiration to direct ''Spirited Away''.]]
Miyazaki had wanted to produce a new film for years, but his two previous proposals{{mdash}}one based on the Japanese book {{nihongo|''Kiri no Mukō no Fushigi na Machi''|霧のむこうのふしぎな町}} by Sachiko Kashiwaba, and another about a teenage heroine{{mdash}}were rejected. His third proposal, which ended up becoming ''Sen and Chihiro's Spirited Away'', was more successful. The three stories revolved around a bathhouse that was inspired by one in Miyazaki's hometown. He thought the bathhouse was a mysterious place, and there was a small door next to one of the bathtubs in the bath house. Miyazaki was always curious to what was behind it, and he made up several stories about it, one of which inspired the bathhouse setting of ''Spirited Away''.<ref name="nausicaa"/>

When production began, Miyazaki realized it would be more than three hours long if he made it according to his plot. He had to delete many scenes from the story, and tried to reduce the "eye candy" in the film because he wanted it to be simple. Miyazaki did not want to make the hero a "pretty girl". At the beginning, he was frustrated at how she looked "dull" and thought, "She isn't cute. Isn't there something we can do?" As the film neared the end, however, he was relieved to feel "she will be a charming woman."<ref name="nausicaa"/>

===English adaptation===
[[John Lasseter]], [[Pixar]] animator and a fan and friend of Miyazaki, would often sit with his staff and watch Miyazaki's work when encountering story problems. After seeing ''Spirited Away'' Lasseter was ecstatic.<ref name="howe3" /> Upon hearing his reaction to the film, Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] asked Lasseter if he would be interested in introducing ''Spirited Away'' to an American audience. Lasseter obliged by agreeing to serve as the executive producer for the English adaptation. Following this, several others began to join the project: ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' co-director [[Kirk Wise]] and ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' co-producer [[Donald W. Ernst]] joined Lasseter as director and producer of ''Spirited Away'', respectively.<ref name="howe3">[http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/16/1393.aspx The Making of Hayao Miyazaki's "Spirited Away"&nbsp;– Part 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317040600/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/michael_howe/archive/2003/04/16/1393.aspx |date=17 March 2009 }}. Jimhillmedia.com.</ref> Screenwriters Cindy Davis Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt penned the English-language dialogue, which they wrote in order to match the characters' original Japanese-language lip movements.<ref name=latimes/>

The cast of the film consists of [[Daveigh Chase]], [[Jason Marsden]], [[Suzanne Pleshette]] (in her final film role before her death in January 2008), [[Michael Chiklis]], [[Lauren Holly]], [[Susan Egan]], [[David Ogden Stiers]] and [[John Ratzenberger]] (a Pixar regular). Advertising was limited, with ''Spirited Away'' being mentioned in a small scrolling section of the film section of ''[[Disney.com]]''; Disney had sidelined their official website for ''Spirited Away''<ref name="howe3" /> and given the film a comparatively small promotional budget.<ref name=fps /> Marc Hairston argues that this was a justified response to Studio Ghibli's retention of the merchandising rights to the film and characters, which limited Disney's ability to properly market the film.<ref name=fps />

==Themes==

=== Supernaturalism ===
The major [[Theme (arts)|themes]] of ''Spirited Away'', heavily influenced by Japanese [[Shinto]]-[[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] folklore, centre on the protagonist Chihiro and her [[Liminality|liminal]] journey through the realm of spirits. The central location of the film is a Japanese bathhouse where a great variety of Japanese folklore creatures, including [[kami]], come to bathe. Miyazaki cites the solstice rituals when villagers call forth their local kami and invite them into their baths.<ref name="ReferenceA" /> Chihiro also encounters kami of animals and plants. Miyazaki says of this:<blockquote>In my grandparents' time, it was believed that kami existed everywhere&nbsp;– in trees, rivers, insects, wells, anything. My generation does not believe this, but I like the idea that we should all treasure everything because spirits might exist there, and we should treasure everything because there is a kind of life to everything.<ref name="ReferenceA" /></blockquote>Chihiro's [[archetype|archetypal]] entrance into another world demarcates her status as one somewhere between child and adult. Chihiro also stands outside societal boundaries in the supernatural setting. The use of the word ''[[kamikakushi]]'' (literally 'hidden by gods') within the Japanese title, and its associated folklore, reinforces this liminal passage: "Kamikakushi is a verdict of 'social death' in this world, and coming back to this world from Kamikakushi meant 'social resurrection.'"<ref name="reider">Reider, Noriko T. 11 February 2009. "Spirited Away: Film of the Fantastic and Evolving Japanese Folk Symbols." ''[[Film Criticism (journal)|Film Criticism]]'' 29(3):4–27.</ref>

Additional themes are expressed through No-Face, who reflects the characters who surround him, learning by example and taking the traits of whomever he consumes. This nature results in No-Face's monstrous rampage through the bathhouse. After Chihiro saves No-Face with the emetic dumpling, he becomes timid once more. At the end of the film, Zeniba decides to take care of No-Face so he can develop without the negative influence of the bathhouse.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gomes, Paul|title=Lesson Plan&nbsp;– Spirited Away|url=http://web41.its.hawaii.edu/manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/wp/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/spiritedaway.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105170315/http://web41.its.hawaii.edu/manoa.hawaii.edu/eastasia/wp/wp-content/uploads/2004/10/spiritedaway.pdf|archive-date=5 November 2013|access-date=12 August 2013|publisher=UHM}}</ref>

==== Fantasy ====
The film has been compared to [[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Through the Looking-Glass|Through the Looking Glass]]'', as the stories have some elements in common such as being set in a [[fantasy world]], the plots including a disturbance in logic and stability, and there being motifs such as food having metamorphic qualities; though developments and themes are not shared.<ref>{{cite web|author=Sunny Bay|date=22 June 2016|title=Beyond Wonderland: 'Spirited Away' Explores The Significance of Dreams in the Real World|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3975727|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814000655/http://moviepilot.com/posts/3975727|archive-date=14 August 2016|work=moviepilot.com}}</ref><ref name="Spark">{{cite web|date=2004|title=Influences on the Film {{!}} Spirited Away|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/film/spiritedaway/section5.rhtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814185733/http://www.sparknotes.com/film/spiritedaway/section5.rhtml|archive-date=14 August 2016|work=SparkNotes}}</ref><ref name="NYT review" /> Among other stories compared to ''Spirited Away'', ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' is seen to be more closely linked thematically.<ref name="Spark" />

Yubaba has many similarities to [[the Coachman]] from the 1940 film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', in the sense that she mutates humans into pigs in a similar way that the boys of [[Pleasure Island (Pinocchio)|Pleasure Island]] were mutated into donkeys. Upon gaining employment at the bathhouse, Yubaba's seizure of Chihiro's [[true name]] symbolically kills the child,<ref name="satoshi3">Satoshi, Ando. 11 February 2009.

She then undergoes a [[rite of passage]] according to the [[monomyth]] format; to recover continuity with her past, Chihiro must create a new identity.<ref name="satoshi3" />

=== Traditional Japanese culture ===
''Spirited Away'' contains critical commentary on modern Japanese society concerning generational conflicts and environmental issues.<ref name="napier" /> Chihiro has been seen as a representation of the ''[[shōjo]]'', whose roles and ideology had changed dramatically since post-war Japan.<ref name="napier" /> Just as Chihiro seeks her past identity, Japan, in its anxiety over the economic downturn occurring during the release of the film in 2001, sought to reconnect to past values.<ref name="satoshi3" /> In an interview, Miyazaki has commented on this nostalgic element for an old Japan.<ref name="midnight-eye">{{cite web|last=Mes|first=Tom|date=7 January 2002|title=Hayao Miyazaki Interview|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao_miyazaki.shtml|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802193550/http://www.midnighteye.com/interviews/hayao_miyazaki.shtml|archive-date=2 August 2009|access-date=1 August 2009|work=Midnight Eye}}</ref>

=== Western consumerism ===
Accordingly, the film can be partly understood as an exploration of the effect of greediness and Western [[consumerism]] on traditional Japanese culture.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Gold|first=Corey|date=14 July 2016|title=Studio Ghibli letter sheds new light on Spirited Away mysteries|publisher=SoraNews24|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/07/14/studio-ghibli-letter-sheds-new-light-on-spirited-away-mysteries/|url-status=live|access-date=24 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170307000504/http://en.rocketnews24.com/2016/07/14/studio-ghibli-letter-sheds-new-light-on-spirited-away-mysteries/|archive-date=7 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> For instance, Yubaba is stylistically unique within the bathhouse, wearing a Western dress and living among European décor and furnishings, in contrast with the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] Japanese style of her employees' quarters, representing the Western [[capitalism|capitalist]] influence over Japan in its [[Meiji (era)|Meiji period]] and beyond. Along with its function within the ostensible [[coming of age]] theme, Yubaba's act of taking Chihiro's name and replacing it with Sen (an alternate reading of ''chi'', the first character in Chihiro's name, {{lit|one thousand}}), can be thought of as symbolic of [[capitalism]]'s single-minded concern with value.<ref name="napier">[[Susan J. Napier|Napier, Susan J.]] 11 February 2009. "Matter Out of Place: Carnival, Containment and Cultural Recovery in Miyazaki's Spirited Away." ''[[Journal of Japanese Studies]]'' 32(2):287–310. {{Doi|10.1353/jjs.2006.0057}}.</ref>

The Meiji design of the abandoned theme park is the setting for Chihiro's parents' metamorphosis&nbsp;– the family arrives in an imported [[Audi]] car and the father wears a European-styled [[polo shirt]], reassuring Chihiro that he has "credit cards and cash," before their morphing into literal consumerist pigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.quia.com/files/quia/users/bakersensei/ext_japanese1.pdf|title=HSC Extension course|publisher=New South Wales Department of Education and Training|access-date=7 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170130074502/https://www.quia.com/files/quia/users/bakersensei/ext_japanese1.pdf|archive-date=30 January 2017}} {{unreliable source?|date=June 2016}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=June 2021}} Miyazaki has stated:<blockquote>Chihiro's parents turning into pigs symbolizes how some humans become greedy. At the very moment Chihiro says there is something odd about this town, her parents turn into pigs. There were people that "turned into pigs" during Japan's [[bubble economy]] ([[Consumerism#Consumerism as cultural ideology|consumer society]]) of the 1980s, and these people still haven't realized they’ve become pigs. Once someone becomes a pig, they don’t return to being human but instead gradually start to have the "body and soul of a pig". These people are the ones saying, "We are in a recession and don’t have enough to eat." This doesn't just apply to the fantasy world. Perhaps this isn't a coincidence and the food is actually (an analogy for) "a trap to catch lost humans."<ref name=":1" /></blockquote>
However, the bathhouse of the spirits cannot be seen as a place free of ambiguity and darkness.<ref name="thrupkaew">Thrupkaew, Noy. "Animation Sensation: Why Japan's Magical Spirited Away Plays Well Anywhere." [[American Prospect]] 13.19: 32–33. Academic OneFile.

Gale. 11 February 2009.</ref> In stark contrast to the simplicity of Chihiro's journey and transformation is the constantly chaotic carnival in the background.<ref name="napier" />

=== Environmentalism ===
There are two major instances of allusions to environmental issues within the movie. The first is seen when Chihiro is dealing with the "stink spirit". The stink spirit was actually a river spirit, but it was so corrupted with filth that one couldn't tell what it was at first glance. It only became clean again when Chihiro pulled out a huge amount of trash, including car tires, garbage, and a bicycle. This alludes to human pollution of the environment, and how people can carelessly toss away things without thinking of the consequences and of where the trash will go.

The second allusion is seen in Haku himself. Haku does not remember his name and lost his past, which is why he is stuck at the bathhouse. Eventually, Chihiro remembers that he used to be the spirit of the Kohaku River, which was destroyed and replaced with apartments. Because of humans' need for development, they destroyed a part of nature, causing Haku to lose his home and identity. This can be compared to deforestation and desertification; humans tear down nature, cause imbalance in the ecosystem, and demolish animals' homes to satisfy their want for more space (housing, malls, stores, etc.) but do not think about how it can affect other living things.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saporito|first1=Jeff|title=What does "Spirited Away" say about Environmentalism?|url=http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|website=ScreenPrism|access-date=1 March 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170303201035/http://screenprism.com/insights/article/what-does-spirited-away-say-about-environmentalism|archive-date=3 March 2017}}</ref>
