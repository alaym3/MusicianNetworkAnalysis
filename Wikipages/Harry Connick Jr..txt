Connick attended [[Jesuit High School (New Orleans)|Jesuit High School]], [[Isidore Newman School]], [[Lakeview School (New Orleans)|Lakeview School]], and the [[New Orleans Center for Creative Arts]], all in New Orleans.

There he met  [[Columbia Records]] executive, Dr. George Butler, who persuaded him to sign with Columbia. His first record, ''[[Harry Connick Jr. (album)|Harry Connick Jr.]]'', was a mainly instrumental album of standards. He soon acquired a reputation in jazz because of extended stays at high-profile New York venues. His next album, ''[[20 (Harry Connick Jr. album)|20]]'', featured his vocals and added to this reputation.

== Career ==

=== ''When Harry Met Sally...'', chart and movie success ===
With Connick's reputation growing, director [[Rob Reiner]] asked him to provide [[When Harry Met Sally... (soundtrack)|a soundtrack]] for his romantic comedy, ''[[When Harry Met Sally...]]'' (1989), starring [[Meg Ryan]] and [[Billy Crystal]]. The soundtrack consisted of several [[Standard (music)|standards]], including "[[It Had to Be You (song)|It Had to Be You]]", "[[Let's Call the Whole Thing Off]]" and "[[Don't Get Around Much Anymore]]", and achieved [[Music recording sales certification|double-platinum]] status in the United States. He won his first [[Grammy Award]] for Best Jazz Male Vocal Performance for his work on the soundtrack.

Connick made his screen debut in ''[[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]]'' (1990), based on a true story about a [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bomber crew in World War II. In that year he began a two-year world tour. In addition, he released two albums in July 1990: the instrumental jazz trio album ''[[Lofty's Roach Souffle]]'' and a big-band album of mostly original songs titled ''[[We Are in Love]]'', which also went double platinum. ''We Are in Love'' earned him his second consecutive Grammy for Best Jazz Male Vocal.

"[[Promise Me You'll Remember (Love Theme from The Godfather Part III)|Promise Me You'll Remember]]", his contribution to the [[The Godfather Part III (soundtrack)|''Godfather III'' soundtrack]], was nominated for both an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1991. In a year of recognition, he was also nominated for an [[Emmy Award]] for Best Performance in a Variety Special for his [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] special ''[[Swingin' Out Live]]'', which was also released as a video. In October 1991, he released his third consecutive multi-platinum album, ''[[Blue Light, Red Light]]'', on which he wrote and arranged the songs. Also in October 1991, he starred in ''[[Little Man Tate]]'', directed by [[Jodie Foster]], playing the friend of a [[child prodigy]] who goes to college.

In November 1992, Connick released ''[[25 (Harry Connick Jr. album)|25]]'', a solo piano collection of standards that again went platinum. He also re-released the album ''[[11 (Harry Connick Jr. album)|Eleven]]''. Connick contributed "A Wink and a Smile" to the ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' soundtrack, released in 1993. His multi-platinum album of holiday songs, ''[[When My Heart Finds Christmas]]'', was the best-selling Christmas album in 1993.

=== Mid-1990s: funk ===
In 1994, Connick decided to branch out. He released ''[[She (Harry Connick Jr. album)|She]]'', an album of New Orleans [[funk]] that also went platinum. In addition, he released a song called "(I Could Only) Whisper Your Name" for the soundtrack of ''[[The Mask (1994 film)|The Mask]]'', starring [[Jim Carrey]], which is his most successful single in the United States to date.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.masterworksbroadway.com/artist/harry-connick-jr/|title=Harry Connick, Jr. {{!}} The Official Masterworks Broadway Site|newspaper=The Official Masterworks Broadway Site|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-25}}</ref>

Connick took his funk music on a tour of the United Kingdom in 1994, an effort that did not please some of his fans, who were expecting a jazz crooner. Connick also went on a tour of the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1995, playing at the Shanghai Center Theatre. The performance was televised live in China for what became known as the Shanghai [[Gumbo]] special. In his third film ''[[Copycat (film)|Copycat]]'' (1995), Connick played a serial killer who terrorizes a psychiatrist (played by [[Sigourney Weaver]]). The following year, he released his second funk album, ''[[Star Turtle]]'', which did not sell as well as previous albums, although it did reach No. 38 on the charts. However, he appeared in the most successful movie of 1996,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=independenceday.htm |title=Independence Day (1996) |website=Box Office Mojo |access-date=May 26, 2010}}</ref> ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', with [[Will Smith]] and [[Jeff Goldblum]].

As part of his tour, he played at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in Oslo, Norway, with his final concert of that tour in Paris being recorded for a [[Valentine's Day]] special on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in 1998. He also continued his film career, starring in ''[[Excess Baggage (1997 film)|Excess Baggage]]'' (1997) opposite [[Alicia Silverstone]] and [[Benicio del Toro]].

In May 1998, he had his first leading role in director [[Forest Whitaker]]'s ''[[Hope Floats]]'', with [[Sandra Bullock]] as his female lead. In 1999 he released ''[[Come By Me]]'', his first album of [[big band]] music in eight years, and embarked on a world tour, visiting the United States, Europe, Japan and Australia. In addition, he provided the voice of Dean McCoppin in the animated film ''[[The Iron Giant]]''.

His music and lyrics earned a [[Tony Award]] nomination. He was also the narrator of the film ''[[My Dog Skip (film)|My Dog Skip]]'', released in that year.

In March 2001, Connick starred in a television production of ''[[South Pacific (2001 film)|South Pacific]]'' with [[Glenn Close]], televised on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] network. He also starred in his twelfth movie, ''[[Mickey (2004 film)|Mickey]]'', featuring a screenplay by [[John Grisham]]. In October 2001, he released two albums: ''[[Songs I Heard]]'', featuring big band re-workings of children's show themes, and ''[[30 (Harry Connick Jr. album)|30]]'', featuring Connick on piano with guest appearances by several other musical artists. ''Songs I Heard'' won Connick another Grammy for Best Traditional Pop Album, and he toured performing songs from the album, holding matinees at which each parent had to be accompanied by a child.

In 2002, he received a {{US patent|6348648}} for a "system and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra."<ref name="Connick">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/patents?vid=USPAT6348648 |title=System and method for coordinating music display among players in an orchestra |access-date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> Connick appeared as [[Grace Adler]]'s boyfriend (and later husband) [[Leo Markus]] on the NBC sitcom ''[[Will & Grace]]'' from 2002 to 2006.

In July 2003, Connick released his first instrumental album in fifteen years, ''[[Other Hours Connick on Piano Volume 1]]''.

An animated holiday special, ''[[The Happy Elf]]'', aired on [[NBC]] in December 2005, with Connick as the composer, the narrator, and one of the executive producers.

== Connick and New Orleans, Hurricane Katrina ==
[[File:Harry Connick, Jr..jpg|thumb|Connick at the New Orleans Jazz Fest 2007]]
Connick, a New Orleans native, is a founder of the [[Krewe of Orpheus]], a music-based New Orleans [[krewe]], taking its name from [[Orpheus]] of classical mythology. The Krewe of Orpheus parades on St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street in [[New Orleans]] on Lundi Gras (Fat Monday){{nsmdns}}the day before [[Mardi Gras]] (Fat Tuesday).

On September 2, 2005, Connick helped organize, and appeared in, the [[NBC]]-sponsored live telethon concert, ''[[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]]'', for relief in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He spent several days touring the city to draw attention to the plight of citizens stranded at the [[Ernest N. Morial Convention Center]] and other places. At the concert he paired with host [[Matt Lauer]] and entertainers including [[Tim McGraw]], [[Faith Hill]], [[Kanye West]], [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], and [[John Goodman]].

On September 6, 2005, Connick was made honorary chair of [[Habitat for Humanity]]'s [[Habitat for Humanity#Habitat's Gulf Coast Recovery|Operation Home Delivery]], a long-term rebuilding plan for families who survived Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans and along the [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]]. His actions in New Orleans earned him a Jefferson Award for Public Service.

Connick's album ''[[Oh, My NOLA]]'', and ''[[Chanson du Vieux Carré : Connick on Piano, Volume 3|Chanson du Vieux Carré]]'' were released in 2007, with a following tour called the [[My New Orleans Tour]].

=== Musicians' Village ===
{{Main|Musicians' Village}}
[[File:MusiciansVillage20Aug07I.jpg|thumb|[[Musicians' Village]] in [[New Orleans]], August 20, 2007]]
Connick and [[Branford Marsalis]] devised an initiative to help restore [[New Orleans]]' musical [[Cultural heritage|heritage]]. [[Habitat for Humanity]] and New Orleans Area Habitat for Humanity, working with Connick and Marsalis announced on December 6, 2005, plans for a [[Musicians' Village]] in New Orleans. The Musicians' Village includes Habitat-constructed homes, with an ''Ellis Marsalis Center for Music'', as the area's centerpiece. The Habitat-built homes provide musicians, and anyone else who qualifies, the opportunity to buy decent, affordable housing.

In 2012, Connick and Marsalis received the S. Roger Horchow Award for Greatest Public Service by a Private Citizen, an award given out annually by [[Jefferson Awards for Public Service|Jefferson Awards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national |title=National |publisher=Jefferson Awards |access-date=August 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124043935/http://jeffersonawards.org/pastwinners/national |archive-date=November 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
