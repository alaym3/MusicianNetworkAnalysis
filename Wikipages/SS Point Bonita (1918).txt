'''SS ''Point Bonita''''' was constructed in 1918 and launched 27 March 1918 after a hull being built for foreign owners at [[Albina Engine and Machine Works]] was requisitioned during World War I by the [[United States Shipping Board]] (USSB). The ship saw service as the Navy transport '''USS ''Point Bonita''''', assigned Identification Number 3496, from 7 October 1918 to 7 April 1919, was returned to the USSB and saw civilian service with several commercial companies as '''''San Pedro''''' and '''''Oliver Olson''''' before again seeing service in [[World War II]] as '''USS ''Camanga'' (AG-42)'''. After return to commercial service as ''Oliver Olson'' the ship was wrecked at the entrance to [[Bandon, Oregon|Bandon]] harbor in Oregon.

== Construction ==
The ship was built in 1918, by Albina Engine and Machine Works, [[Portland, Oregon]] as the yard's hull #3 being built for foreign owners with keel laid on 29 May 1917.{{sfn|McKellar}}{{sfn|Pacific Marine Review (September 1918)|p=117}} The hull was requisitioned by the United States Shipping Board and launched 27 March 1918 as ''Point Bonita''.{{sfn|Colton}}{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Point Bonita''}}{{sfn|McKellar}} The ship was delivered on 24 June 1918.{{sfn|Pacific Marine Review (September 1918)|p=117}}

== World War I service==
''Point Bonita'' was acquired on 7 October 1918 by the Navy and commissioned the same date Lieutenant Commander P. J. Hansen, USNRF, in command. The ship was assigned to the [[Naval Overseas Transportation Service]]. The ship departed New York 19 October in convoy and arrived at [[Nantes]] on 7 November with a cargo of military supplies and high explosives. After unloading she departed 15 November for [[Brest, France|Brest]] to join a westbound convoy on 18 November arriving at New York 16 December. There she loaded a cargo for the USSB, picked up Navy coal at Norfolk and departed for Hawaii 8 January 1919 arriving at Pearl Harbor 7 February. Upon arrival back at New York ''Point Bonita'' decommissioned and was transferred to the USSB on 7 April 1919.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Point Bonita''}}

== Interwar civilian service ==
In 1920 ''Point Bonita'' was sold to the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] where she was engaged in freight only trade between San Francisco and Baltimore with a call at New York.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Point Bonita''}}{{sfn|Pacific Mail Steamship Company advertisement}}

== World War II service==
''Oliver Olson'' was delivered to the [[War Shipping Administration]] (WSA) 25 April 1942 from Oliver J. Olson company at Honolulu, Hawaii and delivered to the Navy the same day under a sub bareboat charter with WSA.{{sfn|MARAD Vessel Status Card: ''Oliver Olson''}}

Commissioned on the day of delivery under the command of Lieutenant R. M. Baughman, [[USNR]] as ''Camanga'' the ship was designated AG-42.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Camanga''}} Illustrating graphically the need for all available shipping in meeting the Navy's enormous logistic assignment in the [[Pacific Ocean]], ''Camanga'', already 24 years old, sailed from [[Pearl Harbor]] 1 June 1942 for [[Pago Pago]], Samoa, where she took up duty carrying cargo and fuel drums between the Samoan and [[Ellice Islands]].{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Camanga''}}

After overhaul at [[San Francisco, California]], between 30 March and 6 June 1943, ''Camanga'' returned to [[Nouméa]] for operations throughout the South [[Pacific Ocean]]. She continued this essential back-area support of fleet operations from [[Guadalcanal]] to the islands of the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] between April and October 1944, returning then to base at Nouméa.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Camanga''}}

An overhaul at [[Auckland]], New Zealand, from November 1944 to January 1945 was the only further interruption to her busy schedule in the [[New Caledonia]] area until 1 October 1945 when she cleared for the [[U.S. West Coast]].{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Camanga''}} During this period ''Camanga'' was assigned to [[Service Force Pacific Fleet]] and under the command of Lieutenant F.A. Muller and Lieutenant Commander J. W. Baldwin.{{sfn|Beans, Bullets, and Black Oil}}

''Camanga'' was decommissioned at [[San Francisco, California]], 10 December 1945 and returned to the [[War Shipping Administration]] the same day.{{sfn|Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships: ''Camanga''}}

==Wreck==

After decommissioning, the ship was reacquired by the Oliver J. Olson Steamship Company. She returned to her former name, ''Oliver Olson'', and was employed in the transportation of lumber. On 3 November 1953, she ran aground at the entrance to [[Bandon, Oregon|Bandon]] harbor in Oregon, becoming stuck on [[Coquille River (Oregon)|Coquille River]]'s south jetty.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nx1WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=t-IDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5821,5111832&hl=en "Schooner Hits Bandon Beach"], ''Eugene Register-Guard'', 3 November 1963. Retrieved 27 April 2012.</ref> The 29 members of crew were rescued, but the ship was declared a total loss and offered for sale to the scrap industry.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kC9WAAAAIBAJ&sjid=POYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2684,4184726&hl=en "Owners try to sell grounded lumber ship"], ''The Spokesman-Review'', 24 November 1953. Retrieved 27 April 2012.</ref> The wreck was only partially salvaged, however, and what remained of the hull was eventually filled with rocks to form an extension of the jetty.<ref>[http://www.cimorelli.com/cgi-bin/magellanscripts/ship_dates_volume.asp?ShipName=Oliver+Olson+(steamer) Oliver Olson (steamer)], Magellan - The Ships Navigator.</ref> The ship can still be seen today at low tide.
