==History==

=== Early Years (2000-2002) ===
Hypnogaja originated as an electronic studio project.

As a live show developed, the band began to incorporate guitars and acoustic drums which resulted in a more rock-oriented sound on the 2002 release ''Post-Hypnotic Stress Disorder''.

2003 began with the feature of Hypnogaja t-shirts and posters in the pilot episode of the [[Bryan Fuller]] series ''[[Dead Like Me]]''. The band released the ''Kill Switch'' EP in August of that year, following the lead single and video "Nothing Box" (directed by Robert E. Blackmon). Hypnogaja embarked on their first U.S. tour in 2004 and continued to tour consistently throughout the aughts, opening for artists such as [[311 (band)|311]], [[Linda Perry]], [[Shinedown]], and [[Saliva (band)|Saliva]].

=== ''Below Sunset'' and ''The Looking Glass Wars'' (2005-2007) ===

The album's first single, "The March," spawned a music video directed by ASC Award-winning cinematographer, [[Nelson Cragg]]. During their tour in support of the album, Hypnogaja appeared on the debut episode of ''Stripped Down Live'', hosted by [[Tears For Fears]]' [[Curt Smith]]. The band rounded out the aughts with a ''[[South by Southwest]]'' showcase slot and two wins at the [[Hollywood Music in Media Awards]], one for Best Alternative Artist and one for Best Male Vocal for ShyBoy's performance of the [[Donna Summer]] song "[[On the Radio (Donna Summer song)|On the Radio]]."
