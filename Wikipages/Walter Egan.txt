==Early years and education==
Egan was born in [[Queens, New York]], United States. In 1970, as a sculpture major, he earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] as one of Georgetown's first art majors. Egan started his career in the arts, concentrating on printmaking and painting, and the music business. As early as 1969, Egan was playing guitar and composing songs with surf-rock group the Malibooz. While an undergraduate, he was a lead guitarist and backup vocalist for the college-formed group Sageworth and Drums, also known as Sageworth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/walter-egan-mn0000227544/biography|title=Walter Egan - Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref> The group evolved from a group of Georgetown University undergraduate students playing weekend mixers and parties to a tight, professional headlining act with a reputation as one of the best and most original bands in the greater Washington, D.C. area.<ref name="Voice"/> Other members included Peter Barry Chowka, lead vocal and guitar; John Zambetti, guitar and backing vocals; John Borger, guitar and backing vocals; Tom Guidera, bass and backing vocals; and Matthew Sheppard, drums, with Annie McLoone added later as a lead singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walteregan.com|title=WalterEgan.com - Official Web Site of Walter Egan|website=Walteregan.com|access-date=11 April 2017}}</ref><ref name="Voice"/>

In 2011, from his home in [[Franklin, Tennessee|Franklin]], he produced a new album entitled ''Raw Elegant'' that was released on Spectra Records.

Egan recorded and toured extensively in the nineties with The Brooklyn Cowboys and has contributed to two albums and an EP to date.

Egan still records and tours occasionally with his early band The Malibooz, contributing extensively to their latest studio effort ‘QE2’ which was released just as the global pandemic took hold in April 2020.

=== Game show appearances ===
In 1985, Egan was a four-time champion on the game show ''[[Catchphrase (U.S. game show)|Catchphrase]]''. In 1986, Egan appeared as a contestant on the television game show ''[[Scrabble (game show)|Scrabble]]''. During his introduction segment, Egan identified himself as a singer and songwriter. Host [[Chuck Woolery]] asked Egan to sing a bit from one of his songs, and he sang the main hook from "Magnet and Steel".

Recent and current projects:

In 2018 and 2019 Egan, along with producer Rob Corich and UK label Red Steel Music started work on new projects that encompassed a series of enhanced remasters each with bonus tracks and each release accompanied by at least one digital two track single, of which the B-sides are often non album releases unavailable elsewhere.

Four back catalogue albums encompassing ‘The Meaning of Live’, ‘Walternative’, ‘Apocolypso Now’, and ‘Mad Dog’ along with two new EP’s ‘Hot Summer Nights’ and ‘Magnet and Steel’ have been released to date and more are under development for release in 2022.

During 2020’s worldwide lockdown this team also produced Egan’s highly acclaimed studio album called ‘Fascination’ which is based around the life and love of the world's most famous groupie, Pamela Des Barres.

Egan has recently completed a cover of the classic ‘Last Fair Deal Gone Down’ for inclusion on a forthcoming tribute to the blues genius Robert Johnson due for release in 2022.

Walter is currently working on a book covering his life story and it’s likely this will be accompanied with a CD of songs relating to his rock and roll stories.

He is also working on a new studio release for early 2022 and this has been tentatively titled ‘Hard Summer Days’.
