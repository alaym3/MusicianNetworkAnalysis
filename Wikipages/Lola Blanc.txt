When Blanc was a pre-teen, her mother was targeted by a religious impostor posing as a true [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] prophet who played on her beliefs and lured her into his web. Blanc found their letters and believed in him, too; she was temporarily separated from her mother, who was coerced into human trafficking until an accomplice who had a change of heart saved her. They were promptly reunited.<ref name="prophet">{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/my-childhood-in-a-mormon-cult-204|title=I Grew Up Believing in a False Prophet|date=2015-02-06|author=Blanc, Lola|accessdate=2016-04-25}}</ref> Eventually Lola moved to Los Angeles, where she now resides, to pursue music full-time.
