We were in huge venues with the biggest sound systems in the world; all these roadies throwin' me basses, and a bunch of models hangin' round Prince to party. For almost two years. That was my university."<ref name="The Guardian"/>

After returning to Oakland from touring with Prince, Saadiq began his professional career as the lead vocalist and bassist in the [[rhythm and blues]] and dance trio [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]] He used the name Raphael Wiggins while in Tony! Toni! Toné!, along with his brother [[Dwayne Wiggins]], and his cousin Timothy Christian. In the mid-1990s, he [[stage name|adopted the last name]] Saadiq, which means "man of his word" in [[Arabic language|Arabic]].<ref name="The Guardian"/> His change of surname led many to speculate that he had converted to [[Islam]] at that point; in reality, Saadiq is not a Muslim, but rather just liked the way "Saadiq" sounded and changed his last name simply to distinguish himself from and avoid potential confusion with his brother, Dwayne Wiggins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusic.com/rasa20in.html |title=Raphael Saadiq 2008 Interview |access-date=September 27, 2008 |first=Jeff |last=Lorez |work=SoulMusic.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080917012246/http://www.soulmusic.com/rasa20in.html |archive-date=September 17, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> As he confirmed by telling noted R&B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning 'Blues & Soul' in May 2009, "I just wanted to have my own identity!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/409/raphael_saadiq_this_years_vintage |title=This Year's Vintage – Pete Lewis Interviews Raphael Saadiq |access-date=September 10, 2009 |first=Pete |last=Lewis |work=Blues & Soul |publisher=Blues & Soul }}</ref>

In 1995, Saadiq had his biggest solo hit to date, when "[[Ask of You]]", featured on the [[Higher Learning (soundtrack)|''Higher Learning'' Soundtrack]] peaked at #19 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and #2 on the [[R&B chart]]. In 1995, Saadiq produced and performed on [[Otis & Shug]]'s debut album, ''[[We Can Do Whatever]]''.

Tony! Toni! Toné! would become major [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] superstars throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. However, after the 1996 album entitled ''[[House of Music]]'' failed to duplicate the group's previous success, Tony! Toni! Toné! went their separate ways in 1997.
