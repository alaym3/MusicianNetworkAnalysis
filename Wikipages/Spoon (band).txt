Spoon released their debut studio album, ''[[Telephono]]'', in 1996 through [[Matador Records]].

==History==
===1993–1997: Early years===
{{More citations needed section|date=April 2021}}
The band was formed in late 1993 by the lead singer and guitarist [[Britt Daniel]] and the drummer [[Jim Eno]], after the two met as members of [[the Alien Beats]].<ref name="chronicle" /> The name Spoon was chosen to honor the 1970s German [[avant-garde]] band [[Can (band)|Can]], whose hit song "[[Spoon (Can song)|Spoon]]" was the theme song to the 1985 movie ''[[Jagged Edge (film)|Jagged Edge]]'' (''Das Messer'') in the United States.<ref>Warren, Tamara. "Waxing Poetic", ''Anthem'', Fall/Winter 2005, p. 54.</ref> Eno describes Spoon's music as "psychedelic".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.threemonkeysonline.com/als/_spoon_jim_eno_gimme_fiction_interview.html |title=Spoon. American Band Spoon. Spoon's Jim Eno in interview - Gimme Fiction. |publisher=Three Monkeys Online |access-date=2011-10-13}}</ref>

Spoon's first recording was the vinyl release of the EP ''[[Nefarious (EP)|Nefarious]]'' in May 1994.<ref name="chronicle">Hernandez, Raoul. [http://weeklywire.com/ww/01-25-99/austin_music_feature1.html "Drake Tungsten and His Boy Skellington."] ''The Austin Chronicle'', January 25, 1999.</ref> In 1995 the band signed with [[Matador Records]], and within a year, Spoon released its first full-length [[LP album|LP]] ''[[Telephono]]'' in 1996. The album was met with mixed reviews, with critics comparing their sound to [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Wire (band)|Wire]].<ref>Brian Howe, [http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11883-telephono-soft-effects-ep/], "Pitchfork", August 1, 2006.</ref> But comparisons aside, ''Telephono'' showed signs of a band slipping free of its influences, mixing post-punk with a blend of pop.<ref>Jennifer Kelly, [http://www.popmatters.com/pm/reviews/article/3744/spoon-soft-effects-ep-telephono "Reviews: ''Soft Effects EP''/''Telephono''"], PopMatters, July 31, 2006.</ref>

Less than a year later, Spoon released its second [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Soft Effects]]'', which served as a transition to their more distinctive, honed sound.<ref>Brian Howe, August 1, 2006.</ref> Unlike its predecessors, ''Soft Effects'' was less noisy and brash, showcasing a more sophisticated, minimalist approach.<ref name="stylus">Kareem Estefan, [http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/artist_profile/spoon.htm "Spoon – Artist Profile"], "Stylus Magazine", September 1, 2003.</ref>

In late 1996, Spoon was playing a gig at the Argo in [[Denton, Texas]] with Ed Cooper and local band Maxine's Radiator, which then featured Josh Zarbo on bass. Zarbo was invited to audition for Daniel and Eno in 1997, and subsequently became the band's full-time bassist until his permanent departure in 2007.<ref name="zarbo">{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/joshuazarbo |title=Joshua Zarbo's MySpace biography |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2011-10-13}}</ref>

===1998–1999: Major label debut===
After the release of ''[[Soft Effects]]'', Spoon signed to [[Elektra Records]] in 1998. Elektra had also been the record label that found and developed the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].<ref> Cook, John, Mac McCaughan, and Laura Ballance.

The album did not sell as well as the label had hoped; merely four months after the release of ''Sneaks'', Spoon's Elektra A&R contact Ron Laffitte quit his job and that week the band was dropped from the label.<ref name="lazyi2001">Tim McMahan, [http://www.timmcmahan.com/spoon.htm "Lazy-I Interview: Spoon"], ''The Omaha Weekly'', April 18, 2001.</ref> Angry with Laffitte, who had promised to stick with the band, Spoon recorded a vindictive yet humorously-titled two-song concept single entitled "The Agony of Laffitte," which was released by Saddle Creek Records. They lamented their experience with the music business executive and questioned his motivations with the songs "The Agony of Laffitte" and "Laffitte Don't Fail Me Now".<ref>Camden Joy, [http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0003,joy,11850,22.html "Total System Failure"], ''The Village Voice'', January 18, 2000.</ref>

===2000–2006: Signing with Merge Records===
Spoon signed with the indie rock label [[Merge Records]] and released the ''[[Love Ways]]'' EP in 2000.<ref name="stylus"/> They did this without bassist Josh Zarbo, who had briefly left the band.<ref name="mixednotes">Ken Lieck, [http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid:78128 "Dancing About Architecture,"] The ''Houston Chronicle'', August 4, 2000.</ref> In 2001, Spoon released its third LP entitled ''[[Girls Can Tell]]''. The new record was a success, selling more copies than both their previous LP releases combined.<ref name=Pop>Sean, [http://popculturewilleatitself.com/2007/sunday-music-spotlight-spoon/ "Sunday Music Spotlight – Spoon"], ''Pop Culture Will Eat Itself '', August 26, 2007.</ref> The band's next release in 2002, ''[[Kill the Moonlight (album)|Kill the Moonlight]]'' had similar success.<ref name=Pop/> ''Kill the Moonlight'' also contained the single, "The Way We Get By", which was popularized by its placement on the movie ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]'' (released later, in 2006) as well as the teen drama ''[[The O.C.]]'' <ref>Brooklyn Vegan Mike, [http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2007/01/rip_the_oc_a_li.html "RIP The O.C. (& a list of EVERY song ever played)"], ''Brooklyn Vegan'', January 3, 2007.</ref> and on the first episode of the American version of the series ''[[Shameless (American TV series)|Shameless]]''. Their next album, ''[[Gimme Fiction]]'', was released in May 2005, and debuted at number 44 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling more than 160,000 copies.<ref name="a360">Joe Gross, [http://www.austin360.com/music/content/music/stories/2007/07/0707spoon.html "In tune with Spoon"], ''Austin 360'', July 5, 2007.</ref>

Spoon's Britt Daniel collaborated with Brian Reitzell to compose and arrange the soundtrack for the 2006 film ''[[Stranger than Fiction (2006 film)|Stranger than Fiction]]''. [[Stranger than Fiction (soundtrack)|The soundtrack]] consists chiefly of music performed by Spoon, and according to the liner notes of the official soundtrack, Brian Reitzell collaborated with Britt Daniel to compose the score, while also adapting several tracks from ''Kill the Moonlight'' and ''Gimme Fiction'' into instrumental versions of the songs.

===2007–2012: ''Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga'' and ''Transference''===
On July 10, 2007, ''[[Ga Ga Ga Ga Ga]]'' was released and debuted at number 10 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>Katie Hasty, [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1050782/ti-holds-off-pumpkins-interpol-to-remain-no-1 "T.I.

Retrieved October 16, 2007.</ref>

In 2009, the review aggregator [[Metacritic]] ranked Spoon as its "Top overall artist of the decade", based on the band's consistently high review scores between 2000 and 2009, among other factors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://features.metacritic.com/features/2009/best-music-of-the-decade/ |title=The Best Music of the Decade - Metacritic |publisher=Features.metacritic.com |access-date=2011-10-13}}</ref> On January 18, 2010, the band released its seventh studio album, ''[[Transference (album)|Transference]]''.
