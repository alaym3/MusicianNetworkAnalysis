'''Smokey Mountain''' was a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[singing]] group formed by musical director, composer, and [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist for Music]] Maestro [[Ryan Cayabyab]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Yan|first=Carrie B|title=Pinoy Musicians: Ryan Cayabyab|url=http://www.globalpinoy.com/gp.topics.v1/viewtopic.php?postid=4dbe6142d162b&channelName=4dbe6142d162b|publisher=GlobalPinoy|access-date=29 May 2012|date=2 May 2011}}</ref><ref name="Belen 2011">{{cite news|last=Martinez-Belen|first=Crispina|title=Jessa, Geneva to release new albums|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/315224/jessa-geneva-release-new-albums|access-date=29 May 2012|newspaper=Manila Bulletin|date=22 April 2011}}</ref> and executive producer Judd Berlin. The original group was based in [[Manila, Philippines]], and had James Coronel, [[Geneva Cruz]], Jeffrey Hidalgo, and [[Tony Lambino]] as its original members while Jayson Angangan, Chedi Vergara, and Zhar Santos joined James Coronel for the second lineup after Geneva Cruz, Jeffrey Hidalgo & Tony Lambino left the group.  Eventually, James Coronel left to pursue a solo career and [[Anna Fegi]] replaced Shar Santos during the 1994 tour in [[Japan]].<ref name="inq-2003-01-25">{{cite news |url=http://www.philstar.com/funfare/article.aspx?articleid=192751&publicationsubcategoryid=70 |title=What Could Be Anna Fegi's Best Moment? |date=2003-01-25 |first=Ricardo |last=Lo |publisher=Phil Star |access-date=2012-09-16 }}</ref>

==First Batch==
The first batch was discovered and developed by songwriter/arranger/musical director Ryan Cayabyab.

The concept for their debut album cover came from the idea that they had to be dressed in ragged clothes to depict the then-dire situation of the scavengers living in the garbage dump in Manila. Hence, that's where the group had derived their name from.

In 1989, the group released its first self-titled [[pop music|pop]] [[album]] that consisted of songs revolving around social, environmental, and patriotic themes.  The group's first hit, ''Kailan'' (When), was number one on national airwaves for eight straight weeks and the album hit gold, platinum, and double-platinum status within months of its release.

In late 1990, the group went on the "Better World" tour, performing at the [[United Nations]] World Summit for Children in New York and representing the Philippines at the 5th [[ASEAN]] Song Festival in [[Surabaya, Indonesia]].

In 1991, Smokey Mountain became only the second Filipino act (after [[Gary Valenciano]]) to participate on [[NHK]]'s ''[[Kōhaku Uta Gassen]]''.<ref name="Kohaku">{{cite web |url=https://www.nhk.or.jp/kouhaku/history/history_42.html |title=42nd Kōhaku Uta Gassen History |publisher=[[NHK]] |access-date=18 August 2021}}</ref>

==Second Batch==
Having to choose between formal schooling and a two-year, two-album contract for release in Europe and the U.S., Tony Lambino and Jeffrey Hidalgo left the group, while Geneva Cruz pursued a solo career & released her first solo album "I like you". The popularity of the group already reached its peak at the time of the departure of the group's 3 members, however, Ryan Cayabyab held auditions to find new members to fill in the void of the 3 founding members who left the group. Ryan Cayabyab then reformed the group with remaining original member James Coronel and three new members Shar Santos, Chedi Vergara, and Jayson Angangan.  This second batch also had successful hits, such as ''[[Da Coconut Nut]]'' (about the benefits of the [[coconut]] tree), ''Paraiso'' (literally ''paradise''; about a degrading environment filled with garbage and smog), and their own version of ''Kailan'' (boy version). They also won awards for both ''Paraiso'', "Kahit Habang Buhay" and ''Tayo Na''.

The media was very critical of the new members who joined James Coronel, however in 1992 at the Tokyo Music Festival the new lineup proved their worth as they won the grand prize in the contest. They also joined the Golden Kite Festival & won the 1st Place trophy, & had more tours in Asia and Europe.

==Third Batch==
In around 1993 they released the 3rd & international album "Know You Will", after the promotion of the 3rd album James Coronel would leave the group. The remnants of the latest batch released the 4th album "Death Penalty" & disbanded a year later.  In 1998 BMG Records (now Sony Music Philippines) released the fifth and final album of the Smokey Mountain "Smokiest Hits" with 12 tracks.

==Reunited for Charity in 2011 and 2020==
In March 2011, all Smokey Mountain members re-united for the first time in 15 years to record a new song for Japan earthquake relief entitled I FEEL WHAT YOU FEEL.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0FuFBONMlk</ref> The group has strong ties to Japan as some members lived in Tokyo during the peak of their popularity in the early 1990s.  Due to the members now being spread out all over the globe, the song was recorded separately and then edited together in a studio.

In May 2020, the members again reunited virtually for a Bayanihan Musikahan special.<ref name="rappler-2020-05-04">{{cite news |url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/music/259832-video-smokey-mountain-members-medley-performance-bayanihan-musikahan-special |title=Smokey Mountain Members Reunite for 'Bayanihan Musikahan' Special |date=May 4, 2020 |work=Rappler |access-date=May 4, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="MB-2020-05-04">{{cite news |url=https://entertainment.mb.com.ph/2020/05/04/smokey-mountain-reunite-for-bayanihan-musikahan/|title=Smokey Mountain Reunite for 'Bayanihan Musikahan'  |date=May 4, 2020 |first=Rizal |last=Obanil |publisher=Manila Bulletin |access-date=May 4, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="ABS-2020-04-24">{{cite news |url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/04/24/20/sneak-peek-smokey-mountain-in-virtual-reunion-for-bayanihan-fundraiser|title=Smokey Mountain In Virtual Reunion for 'Bayanihan' Fundraiser  |date=April 24, 2020 |first=Rizal |last=Obanil |publisher=ABS-CBN News |access-date=April 24, 2020 }}</ref><ref name="inq-2020-04-26">{{cite news |url=https://entertainment.inquirer.net/372885/smokey-mountain-to-reunite-for-ryan-cayabyab-fundraiser-bayanihan-musikahan|title=Smokey Mountain to Reunite for Ryan Cayabyab Fundraiser 'Bayanihan Musikahan'  |date=April 26, 2020 |first=Ryan |last=Arcadio |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |access-date=April 26, 2020 }}</ref>  They performed a "Paraiso/Better World medley as well as "Da Coconut Nut."<ref name="abs life-2020-05-03">{{cite news |url=https://lifestyle.abs-cbn.com/articles/8665/smokey-mountain-reunion|title=Celebrating 30 Years, Smokey Mountain Reunites for a Cause  |date=May 3, 2020 |first=Jeffrey |last=Hidalgo |publisher=ABS-CBN Lifestyle |access-date=May 3, 2020 }}</ref>  The performance was shown on [[ABS-CBN]] as well as streamed as a fundraising effort for the coronavirus pandemic.
