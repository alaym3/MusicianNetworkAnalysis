==Early life==
<!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:Abida Parveen in 1992.jpg|thumb|right|Parveen in 1992 in Dubai.|75px]] -->
Parveen was born in [[mohalla]] Ali Goharabad in [[Larkana]], [[Sindh]], Pakistan. She received her musical training initially from her father, [[Ustad]] Ghulam Haider, whom she refers as Baba Sain and Gawwaya. He had his own musical school where Parveen got her devotional inspiration from. She and her father would often perform at shrines of Sufi Saints. Parveen's talent compelled her father to choose her as his musical heir over his two sons. Growing up, she attended her father's music school, where her foundation in music was laid.<ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/bombay-times/begum-abida-parveen-sings-dil-se/articleshow/26475.cms Begum Abida Parveen sings dil se] TNN, ''[[The Times of India]]'', 17 June 2003.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://sindhiaudio.blogspot.com/2007/08/abida-parveen-biography.html|title=SINDHI MUSIC|author=Mughal |work=sindhiaudio.blogspot.com|access-date=18 January 2015|date=31 August 2007}}</ref> Later Ustad Salamat Ali Khan of the [[Sham Chaurasia gharana]] also taught and nurtured her. Parveen always remembers that she was never forced towards this occupation and she sang her first complete kalam when she was only 3 years old.

==Career==
[[File:Abida Parveen concert 1.jpg|thumb|Parveen at her concert in [[Oslo]], 2007]]
Parveen had already begun performing at Dargahs and Urs in the early 1970s, but it was in 1973, on [[Radio Pakistan]], that she achieved her first real breakthrough with the [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] song ''Tuhinje zulfan jay band kamand widha.'' In 1977 she was introduced as an official singer on [[Radio Pakistan]]. Since then, Parveen has risen to prominence and is now considered one of the finest vocal artists of Pakistan. She has imbued [[Sufi]] music with a new identity, marking the beginning of this journey at [[Sultana Siddiqui]]'s Awaz-o-Andaz in 1980.

Parveen travels internationally, often performing at sold-out venues.<ref name="travel-culture.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.travel-culture.com/pakistan/music/abida-parveen.shtml|title=Abida Parveen|work=travel-culture.com|access-date=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref name="theguardian.com">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/08/abida-parveen-sufi-singer-passion|title=Abida Parveen: 'I'm not a man or a woman, I'm a vehicle for passion'|author=Nosheen Iqbal|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=18 January 2015|date=8 July 2013}}</ref> Her 1988 performance in Chicago was recorded by the Hazrat [[Amir Khusrau]] Society of Art and Culture, which issued a LP of her songs. Her 1989 performance in London's [[Wembley Conference Centre]] was broadcast on the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]. Parveen cites her motivation for international travel as being to spread [[Sufism]], peace and the divine message. In doing so, she also promotes Pakistani culture.

She commented:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forumpakistan.com/abida-parveen-profile-interview-and-pictures-t57031.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111224053648/http://www.forumpakistan.com/abida-parveen-profile-interview-and-pictures-t57031.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 December 2011|title=Abida Parveen – profile, interview & pictures|work=forumpakistan.com|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref>
<blockquote>"This project which Rohail Hyatt has started is indeed great and I would like to be a part of it for a long time. The music that comes out of this project reaches both the heart and soul and it always compliments the lyrics without overriding the true message of the kalams. This platform builds on those messages of our Sufi elders."</blockquote>

She was invited back in [[Coke Studio Pakistan (season 7)|season 7]] in 2014. She sang "Mein Sufi Hoon" with [[Rais Khan]] and performed "dost" as a solo. She also performed "Chaap Tilak" (A popular Sufi poem by [[Sufi]] poet [[Amir Khusro]]) in a duet with [[Rahat Fateh Ali Khan]].

Abida was also a part of season 9. Her first song along with other artists in the season, "Ae Rah Haq K Shaheedo" was dedicated to the war martyrs.<ref name=Dawn3/> After that she sang a duet with [[Ali Sethi]] entitled "Aaqa", then solo an entitled "Maula-i-Kull".

== Quotes ==
* "Pakistan seems disconnected from the outside. But it is built and running on prayers of our Sufi kings, our ''pirs''. Poor people, rich people – we are all God's servants … I'm lucky. My audience is my God."<ref name="Iqbal">{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/08/abida-parveen-sufi-singer-passion|title=Abida Parveen: 'I'm not a man or a woman, I'm a vehicle for passion'|last=Iqbal|first=Nosheen|date=8 July 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|issn=0261-3077|access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref>
* "The songs purify the soul of a human being, the human is so involved that he has left God. The songs bring us near to God, near the Almighty, so that the human soul should be purified and satisfied."<ref name="EPSTEIN"/>

==Personal life==
===Education===
Abida got her master's degree from Sindh and also learnt Urdu, Sindhi and [[Persian language|Persian]] specifically.

===Marriage and family===
In 1975, Abida married Ghulam Hussain Sheikh, senior producer at [[Radio Pakistan]], who had retired from his job in the 1980s to manage and mentor Parveen's career. After he died of a heart attack on an international flight in the early 2000s, their daughter Maryam took up that role. There is a sense that Parveen's career has taken a more commercial route as a result of it.<ref name="theguardian.com"/> The couple has two daughters Pereha Ikram and Marium Hussain, and a son Sarang Latif who is a music director. All three children act as her advisors.<ref name="travel-culture.com"/> Her family understands her need for ''riyaz'' ( daily vocal music practice) and its required space to do that practice.<ref name="fuchsia.com.sg">{{cite web|url=http://fuchsia.com.sg/?p=5503|title=An Exclusive Interview with Abida Parveen- The Reigning Queen of Sufi Music|work=Fuchsia|access-date=18 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129032719/http://fuchsia.com.sg/?p=5503|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Abida Parveen Gallery===
Parveen is also interested in the arts. She owns the Abida Parveen Gallery which features jewellery, paintings, her music CDs, awards section and garments and accessories and is run by her daughters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/411142/a-store-thats-jewellery-will-set-it-apart|author=Vaqas Asghar|title=A store that's jewellery will 'set it apart'|work=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=21 July 2012|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> She also has her own music recording studio there.

===Clothing style===
Parveen has a distinctive clothing style which she has created herself for ease and comfort. She wears long simple frocks buttoned up to the top covered with a coat. She is always accompanied by an ''ajrak'', a sindhi ''duppatta'', which she claims comes from the ''dargah'' (mausoleum) of [[Sufi saint]] [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]] and her wardrobe is full of it.

===Other===
Parveen has taken Bayyat and became a disciple of Najeeb Sultan, her spiritual master. Parveen suffered a heart attack during a performance in [[Lahore]] on 28 November 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Abida Parveen suffers heart attack during performance|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/83019/abida-parveen-suffers-heart-attack-during-performance/|access-date=9 November 2018|publisher=The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=28 November 2010}}</ref> [[Angiography]] and [[angioplasty]] were performed on her.

==Filmography==
Although Parveen is a highly acclaimed singer, she has never rendered her voice to films. Her pre-recorded songs have been used in films, however, on the insistence of her fans and Farooq Mengal. Parveen appears less and less in interviews and television morning shows due to her shy personality. Parveen confesses that she keeps getting offers from [[Bollywood]] film-makers namely [[Subhash Ghai]] and [[Yash Chopra]] but she keeps declining them as she has immersed herself in [[Sufism]] and it is time-consuming to spread the Divine Message.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/bollywood-can-wait-abida-parveen-interview_100456305.html%3E|title=Bollywood can wait: Abida Parveen (Interview)|publisher=Thaindian News|date=8 November 2010|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref> She even got offers from [[Shah Rukh Khan]] for [[Ra.One]] and music director [[A.R.Rehman]] has offered her some songs, too.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/news-and-interviews/Abida-Parveen-and-Runa-Laila-to-spread-love-in-India/articleshow/16049861.cms|title=Abida Parveen and Runa Laila to spread love in India |newspaper=The Times of India|author=Bharti Dubey|date=31 August 2012|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref>
