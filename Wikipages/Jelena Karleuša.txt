Rose to prominence in the mid-nineties, Karleuša established herself as one of the leading regional performers during the following decades with a series of successful albums, including ''[[Samo za tvoje oči]]'' (2002), ''[[Magija]]'' (2005), ''[[JK Revolution]]'' (2008) and ''[[Diva (Jelena Karleuša album)|Diva]]'' (2012), and two headline Belgrade concerts: ''All About Diva'' (2010) and ''Viva la Diva Show'' (2013).

==Early life==
Jelena Karleuša was born on August 17, 1978 in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]]. Her mother, Divna (25 January 1958 – 3 March 2019),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/scena.147.html:780664-PREMINULA-MAJKA-JELENE-KARLEUSE-Divna-izgubila-bitku-sa-opakom-bolescu|title=Preminula majka Jelene Karleuše!

Karleuša demonstrated an affinity for music from an early age, being influenced by performers such as [[Lepa Brena]]. She attended [[Zemun Gymnasium]], but eventually graduated from the New Belgrade's High School of Tourism, as well as from a music school playing the [[flute]].<ref name="Grand">{{cite web|url=https://www.grand.online/zvezde-granda/news/jelena-karleusa-ja-sam-crna-ovca-u-porodici-foto|title=Jelena Karleuša: Ja sam "crna ovca" u porodici|website=grand.online|language=sr}}</ref> She describes herself as the "[[black sheep]]" of the family, being the only one without an academic degree.<ref name="Grand"/>

==Career==
At sixteen years of age, Karleuša expressed desire to become a singer to her mother's support, who nevertheless wasn't able to financially support Jelena's debut album due to inflation and challenging economic situation in the country. Eventually, with help from singer [[Dragana Mirković]], Karleuša managed to release her first album ''Ogledalce'' (''Little Mirror'') under [[Diskos (record label)|Diskos]] on 24 April 1995. It saw commercial success, selling around 100,000 copies in [[Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslavia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.novosti.rs/vesti/scena.147.html:830834-Sa-Divninom-platom-od-dve-marke-Karleusa-je-mogla-da-sanja-karijeru-Evo-sta-je-Dragana-Mirkovic-uradila-pre-25-godina-da-joj-pomogne|title=Sa Divninom platom od dve marke Karleuša je mogla da sanja karijeru! Evo šta je Dragana Mirković uradila pre 25 godina da joj pomogne|website=[[Večernje Novosti|novosti.rs]]|language=sr}}</ref> Later, she released five more [[turbo-folk]]-oriented records, but as her career progressed she tried to be perceived exclusively as a performer of [[pop music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tracara.com/jelena-karleusa-folk-ili-pop-pitanje-je-sad/|title=Jelena Karleuša – folk ili pop, pitanje je sad!|date= 2011|publisher=Tracara.com|language=sr}}</ref>

In 2002, she collaborated with Greek label [[Heaven Music]] and their eminent songwriter [[Phoebus (songwriter)|Phoebus]] on her seventh album, titled ''[[Samo za tvoje oči]]'' (''For Your Eyes Only''). In February 2004, Karleuša took part in [[Beovizija 2004|Beovizija]] music festival with "Moli me" (''Beg Me'') to qualify as [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004|Serbia and Montenegro]]'s entry for the [[2004 Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]], but ultimately lost. Her album ''[[Magija]]'' (''Magic'') was then released in February the following year under new label, [[City Records]]. Following her performance on Beovizija and a brief appearance to promote her album, Karleuša got blacklisted from Serbia's public broadcaster, [[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]], during the tenure of [[Aleksandar Tijanić]] due to her "inappropriate" appearance.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gotov rat: Skinuta Tijanićeva zabrana, Karleuša se vraća na RTS!|url=https://www.kurir.rs/stars/2421593/gotov-rat-skinuta-tijaniceva-zabrana-karleusa-se-vraca-na-rts |date=31 August 2016|access-date=6 February 2021|website=[[Kurir (Newspapers)|kurir.rs]]|language=sr}}</ref> She did not appear on RTS again until September 2016. In February 2008, Karleuša delivered her [[List of best-selling albums by country#Serbia|best-selling album]] to date, titled ''[[JK Revolution]]'', despite facing public scrutiny for the infamous studio session of the lead single "Tihi ubica" (''Silent Killer''), which was leaked to the public and provoked discussion about her vocal abilities.

In March 2009, she entered ''[[Big Brother VIP (Serbian season 3)|Serbian Celebrity Big Brother]]'' as a guest and exited on the second day. At the end of the year, Karleuša launched a clothing line, called ''JK Wear''. In December, she also released "Insomnia", which covered a [[Bollywood]] song from the movie ''[[Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi]]''. The [[electronic music|electro]]-infused single was downloaded over a million times for free from Karleuša's official website. Furthermore, the eccentric visual for the song became the first Serbian music video to go viral on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite news |title=JK "Insomnia" ruši rekorde |url=http://tracara.com/jk-insomnia-rusi-rekorde/ |website=tračara.com |date=4 January 2010 |access-date=17 November 2010}}</ref> She then announced her concert in the [[Belgrade Arena]], named ''All About Diva Show'', with "never before seen" production by a Serbian performer. It was held on May 10 to a sold-out venue of 15,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tracara.com/jk-napunila-arenu/|title=JK napunila Arenu!|date=May 2010|publisher=Tracara.com|language=sr}}</ref> In November, she released a live album alongside a DVD from the concert, which was two years later, upon the release of her next album, certified platinum by the label. During the same year, Karleuša also landed a [[column]] in the daily newspaper ''[[Kurir]]'', which raised controversy for her comments on politics and show business.

Her tenth album ''[[Diva (Jelena Karleuša album)|Diva]]'' was released on 11 June 2012, after being postponed several times. It saw commercial success, becoming one of the fastest-selling albums by a Serbian artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tracara.com/jk-prodala-300-000-albuma-u-danu/|title=JK prodala 300 000 albuma u danu|date=June 2012|language=sr|website=Tračara}}</ref> The record also marked a significant departure from her previous pop-folk releases, as it comprises [[dance-pop]] and [[electropop]] songs with [[hip-hop]] and [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] influences. She announced her second Belgrade concert for 15 June 2013 in [[Ušće, Belgrade|Ušće]]. However, the concert, titled ''Viva la Diva Show'', began after over an hour of delay due to technical issues regarding video and audio production, which continued throughout the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tracara.com/sta-nismo-videli-na-karleusinom-koncertu-na-uscu/|title=Šta sve nismo videli na Karleušinom koncertu na Ušću|website=tracara.com|language=sr}}</ref> Nevertheless, Karleuša managed to perform all the songs. Afterwards, she faced heavy criticism from the media because of which she eventually decided to take a break from public.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arhiva.vesti-online.com/Scena/Estrada/321781/Karleusin-dokaz-da-je-na-Uscu-bilo-40000-ljudi|title=Karleušin dokaz da je na Ušću bilo 40 000 ljudi|website=vesti-online.com|language=sr}}</ref> Karleuša also got banned from [[RTV Pink]] and lost her contract with City Records following a disagreement with [[Željko Mitrović]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Jelena Karleuša: Nisam zaslužila da me zabranjuju|url=https://www.novosti.rs/vesti/scena.147.html:765368-Jelena-Karleusa-Nisam-zasluzila-da-me-zabranjuju|date=31 August 2016|access-date=11 December 2018|publisher=[[Večernje Novosti]]|language=sr}}</ref>

==Personal life==
===Marriages and children===
On 23 September 2004, Karleuša married Bojan Karić, who is best known as the nephew of the controversial Serbian businessman [[Bogoljub Karić]]. However, they divorced in March the following year.<ref name="Marriages">{{cite web|url=https://www.hellomagazin.rs/celebrity-news/istina-nakon-15-godina-zasto-su-se-jelena-karleusa-i-bojan-karic-zapravo-razveli/|title=Istina nakon 15 godina, zašto su se Jelena Karluša i Bojan Karić razveli|website=hellomagazine.rs|language=sr|access-date=27 March 2020}}</ref>

===Lawsuit against Ceca===
In 2010, Karleuša was sued by Serbian singer [[Ceca (singer)|Svetlana "Ceca" Ražnatović]] for damaging her reputation and causing her emotional pain after she had addressed Ražnatović in an open letter via [[Facebook]] in which she held her responsible of being involved in the 1999 assassination of Zoran Davidović, Karleuša's then-boyfriend who was often connected with crime.<ref name="Open letter">{{cite web|url=https://www.ekskluziva.ba/ovo-je-otvoreno-pismo-jelene-karleuse-zbog-kojeg-ju-je-ceca-tuzila/218764|title=Ovo je otvoreno pismo Jelene Karleuše zbog kojeg ju je Ceca tužila|language=sr|website=ekskluziva.ba}}</ref> Furthermore, Karleuša accused Ražnatović of maintaining close ties with leaders of the [[Zemun clan]], claiming Ceca was "at the head of the table" following the assassination of her husband and career criminal, [[Željko Ražnatović]] in 2000.<ref name="Open letter"/> Finally, Karleuša also addressed the rumors of Ceca ordering articles through her acquaintances in the media and show business, to create bad publicity for Karleuša.<ref name="Open letter"/>

In February 2017, Svetlana Ražnatović claimed victory over Karleuša, who was fined with [[euro|€]]650 and ordered to cover Ceca's €900 court expenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/jetset/2632687-gotovo-je-ceca-dobila-jelenu-na-sudu-evo-koliko-para-karleusa-mora-da-joj-plati|title=Gotovo je!

===Sex scandal===
In January 2019, media started speculating about an affair between Karleuša and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnian]] footballer [[Ognjen Vranješ]], which she firmly denied.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tracara.com/jelena-karleusa-moj-brak-je-jaci-od-tabloida/|title=Jelena Karleuša: Moj brak je jači od tabloida|date=January 11, 2019|website=tracara.rs|access-date=January 7, 2021|language=sr}}</ref> Subsequently, the scandal erupted when nude photos of her started circulating the web and were eventually placed on the cover of every daily tabloid in Serbia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kurir.rs/stars/3189833/afera-2-deo-sok-prepiska-i-slike-isplivale-nove-skandalozne-poruke-i-fotke-jk-i-vranjesa|title=Porno afera 2. deo!

==Public image==
Jelena Karleuša has a very polarized public reception of her work, image and persona.

Regarded as a style icon, over the years Karleuša has acquired significant foreign recognition through fashion.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tracara.com/jelena-karleusa-u-internacionalnoj-modnoj-akademiji-u-parizu/|title=Jelena Karleuša u internacionalnoj modnoj akademiji u Parizu|publisher=Tračara|language=sr}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://tracara.com/karleusa-u-prvom-redu-versace-revije-u-milanu/|title=Karleuša u prvom redu Versace revije u Milanu|date= February 2018|publisher=Tracara.com|language=sr}}</ref> In 2015, she rose to international prominence after she had accused [[Kim Kardashian]], and then [[Beyoncé]], of copying her fashion style, thus was featured on ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', among many other media outlets from around the world, debating on her style and [[social media]] influence.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kim Kardashian Copying Jelena Karleusa's Style?

At the beginning of 2016, she had another international media incident when the 2015 [[88th Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[Amy (2015 film)|documentary]] about [[Amy Winehouse]] falsely used unlicensed scenes from Jelena's 2013 concert as ones of Winehouse's last Belgrade performance. Karleuša initially planned to settle lawsuits against the creators for [[copyright infringement]], but eventually gave up due to respect of the late singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/english/1946129-world-class-scandal-in-a-documentary-about-amy-winehouse-used-videos-were-stolen-from-the-concert-of-a-serbian-singer-photo-video|title=World-class scandal: In a documentary about Amy Winehouse used videos were stolen from the concert of a Serbian singer|date=2015|publisher=Telegraf.rs}}</ref>

===Philanthropy and advocacy===
Karleuša is one of the first Serbian celebrities to publicly support [[LGBT rights by country or territory#Serbia|LGBT rights]], thus considered a [[gay icon]].
