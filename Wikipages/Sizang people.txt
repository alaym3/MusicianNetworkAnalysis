'''The Siyin (Sizang) people''' or the '''Taute people''' are mainly the descendants of [[Pu Thuantak]], who are also known as Suantak in [[Tedim language]] and related [[clan]]s, and their adopted sons and daughters.  The [[Siyin Valley]] is located in the present day [[Chin State]], [[Myanmar]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|date=2019|title=Cultural and Linguistic Affinities Amongst Meitei-Sizang-Thadou|url=http://lsn.org.np/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/NepaleseLinguistics-vol-341.pdf#page=63|journal=Nepalese Linguistics|volume=34|pages=58–67}}</ref> founded by the descendants of the Pu Thuantak, when they moved away from their original home of [[Ciimnuai]] with other [[Zo (people)|Zo]] (Chin) people such as the [[Sukte people|Sukte]], [[Thadou people|Thado]], [[Zou people|Zou]], and other related tribes.

Zo lived collectively in the place known as [[Ciimnuai]], for a long period of time until they experienced a population [[Human overpopulation|explosion]]. Finding new settlements then became essential for their survival for [[Tillage|cultivation]], in the hope of getting sufficient food from fertile soil for each community. Consequently, they scattered throughout the mountains, dales and valleys within and surrounding the present Chin State. Due to communication difficulties and their isolation, each departed group from Ciimnuai developed a unique [[dialect]]. The [[Sizang language]] emerged the same way{{clarify|date=May 2012}} as [[Vaiphei language|Vaiphei]], [[Teizang]], [[Saizang]], Val, Zou, Dim, [[Khuangsai]], [[Hangmi/Milhiem]] and others, and are closely related to one another.

{{As of|2019}}, their population is about 10,000.

==Meaning and definition==
''Si'' means salt water; ''Zang'' means the northern side or plain. ''Sizang'' is known as Siyin thus represents people who live in the northern part of ''the spring of salt water''. ''Sizang'' was already the name of a place to which [[immigrant]]s from Ciimuai relocated. Later generations that continued to live in the same location, have adopted ''Sizang'' as their [[ethnic group|ethnic identity]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} The meaning of ''taute'' which they have been referred to in Manipur records is "fat folks".<ref name=":0" />

==Culture and Tradition==
The Siyin (Sizang) had a proud warrior tradition that is somewhat similar to the [[Naga people]] with slight variations. The Siyin widely practiced head hunting<ref name=":0" /> and kept the head in the main hall of the village (innpi) and when a siyin die it is the duty of his/her family to dry up the body before the burial which usually take months.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

Their society was patriarchal with inheritance going to sons over daughters.<ref name=":0" />

Marriage was forbidden between a man and a woman from the same village, these marriages were known as ''phungkhawm''.<ref name=":0" /> The eldest man of the groom's tribe would go to the bride's tribe to propose a marriage, he would bring a ''modokzu'' ({{Translation|pot of liquor}}) as a gift to the bride's family.<ref name=":0" /> If the proposal was refused he brought the ''modokzu'' back with him.<ref name=":0" />

Male babies are names 5 days after birth and female babies are named after 3 days.<ref name=":0" /> Though they are given a temporary surname to protect them from spirits.<ref name=":0" /> Parents choose the name, the first son is named after his paternal grandfather and the first daughter is named after her paternal grandmother.<ref name=":0" />

==Religion==
Before their [[religious conversion|conversion]] to [[Christianity]], the Siyin (Sizang) were [[animist]]s, worshipping nature, Doai (Devil/spirit), and Pathian (God).<ref name=":0" /> They worshiped unknown spirits in order to avoid being harmed. Pleasing the Devil was an essential part of their ritual performance and worship.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Illnesses were believed to be caused by evil spirits.<ref name=":0" />

They believed that their ancestors came out of a gourd in the village of Chin-Nwe.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Grierson|first=George A.|url=https://archive.org/details/LSIV0-V11/LSI-V3-3/page/n84/mode/1up|title=Specimens of the Kuki-Chin and Burma Groups|publisher=Superintendent of Government Printing|year=1904|location=Calcutta, India|pages=73–74|chapter=Siyin}}</ref>

==Important places==
{{Unbalanced|date=December 2010}}
*[[Fort White, Burma|Fort White]]: British Field Marshal Sir [[George White (British Army officer)|George Stuart White]] built a fort at Thangmual mountain, called Fort White, during the [[Second World War]], to defend against the [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] invasion of Burma. The nearest places to Fort white are [[Khuasak]] and [[Taingen]]. Fort White was later moved to [[Thuklai]]. [http://www.fallingrain.com/world/BM/2/Fort_White.html Fort White on map].
*Sial Lum Fort: The native Siyin (Sizang) fought the [[United Kingdom|British]] viciously, at Sial Lum Fort, near [[Voklak]] village. Many British soldiers lost their lives. The state government continues to preserve Sial Lum Fort today for commemoration of the heroic acts of the Siyin (Sizang), in their rebellion against [[imperialism]].
*Mount Kennedy: Locally known as ''Thuammual'', it was one of the British army's headquarters during the Second World War. Many battles were fought on the mount of Kennedy between the Japanese army and the British army.

==Occupation==
The main occupation is shifting ([[slash and burn]]) cultivation, with the exceptional keeping of livestock such as rearing [[cow]]s, [[gayal]]s, [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s and [[pig]]s in the countryside. There are a number of people who also work in the public sector, as civil servants, for example.

==Language and Dialect==
The Siyin (Sizang) have a unique dialect but it is very close to the present [[Tedim]] dialect. Their language is also comparable to the [[Meitei people]] and the [[Thadou people]] of India.<ref name=":0" /> The Sizang language did not have a written script until after contact with British colonisers, it is now written in the Roman script.<ref name=":0" />

==The root of the people called Sizang and Vaiphei==
The descendants of '''Pu Zahong''' are to be found almost every where in the northern [[Chin State]] in [[Burma]], in [[Churachandpur district|Churachandpur]], [[Chandel district|Chandel]] and [[Sadar Hills Autonomous District Council|Sadar hills]] area of [[Manipur State]] and also in [[Mizoram State]] of India.

In [[Mizoram]] we find many of Pu Zahmuaka's descendants such as the Zadeng, Palian, Thangluah, Thangur {Chonglul, Chenkual and Sailo, Rivung, and Rokhum. Pu Zahmuaka is descended from Pu Boklua Suantak who is also known as Sisinga or Sizanga. Boklua's father, Ngengu (Nenu) was the founder of Lophei village in Siyin valley of Chin State. [[Ngengu]] is the eldest son of Pu Thuantak (Suantak), who himself is descended from '''Pu Vaiphei''' or '''Pu Zahong'''. The Siyin regarded Pu Thuantak as the direct progenitor of the Siyin, Thaute, Khiangte and Vaiphei. The Siyin are also referred to as Thaute, Khiangte, Siyin, Thuantak etc.

And according to Sizang elders, Pu Thuantak (Suantak) had four sons viz. Ngengu, Neihlut, Daitawng and Vanglok from whom are descended the clans of the Sizang and Vaiphei.

(1) '''Ngengu''' -

(i) [[Lamhtam]]- Batkai (Kiimlel and Seam Muang), Neizalh (Thatmun & Thatlang), Liimtuang (Khansiing, Mangson & Tuangthang) etc.

(ii) [[Boklua]]/Sihsing - Zahmuak ( [[Zadeng]], [[Palian]], [[Thangluah]], [[Rivung]], [[Rokhum]], [[Sailo]] (adopted by Thangmang, son of Thangur), [[Chenkual]] and [[Chawnglul]]) and Nge Ngawn ( progenitor of the Ngawn tribe).

(iii) [[Phiamphu]] -

(iv) [[Tungnung]]- Ngenthang, Nitson, Daijang etc.

(v) [[Phucil]]/ [[Phuthil]]/ [[Phuthir]]-

(vi) [[Nantal]]/ [[Hangtal]]/ [[Hrangchal]] -[[Tunglut]], [[Tungdim]] and [[Tungte]] (Laiasung, Darasung etc.).

(2) '''Neihlut''' -

(i) [[Thanglet]]- Changtui etc.

(ii) [[Leisel]]

(iii) [[Thangsoi]]- [[Khuakuan]]/[[Baite]] [Paute, Meihlai, Thangthem, Phungkhol, Kholsong (Chongzang), Kholngul, Kholphut (Thangkon), Thenchuang, Thangsei, Singngul, Ngulmun, Senlhung, Langtho] and [[Luangte]]

(iv) [[Lutngul]]-

(v) [[Hansing]]-

(vi) [[Saivung]]-

(vii) [[Puakpawl]]-

(viii) [[Thanggo]] - Genzo ([[Khupmu]] and [[Suante]] [ Suanman, Suanzong, Luahlang, Manghil, Doson, etc.])

(ix) [[Neikeng]]/[[Lamkeng]]/Suanzo - [[Muamul]]/[[Dopmul]] ( [[Mulpi]], [[Hanthual]], [[Hawlhang]], [[Kunhen]] and [[Guizo]])

(3) '''Daitawng''' -

(i) Nunzong- Tuakon etc.

(ii) Hinnung- Hinzong, Haunam etc.

(iii) Namzo- Hinnam etc.

(iv) [[Sukzo]],

(vi) Zasuan - Sînte, Pânte, Kâwngte, Vâmlang, Zahlang, Khupsawn and Lamkai.

(4) '''Vanglok''' -

(i) [[Hangsawk]] - Tonsung, etc.

(ii) [[Thuklai]] - Lunmun, Suumniang, Tuanuam, Zamang, and Zangkaai.

(iii) [[Limkhai]] - Sitzom, Tunawi, Tunmang, Ngo Thua, Tun Seal, etc.

From their original homeland, Siyin valley, the Vaiphei wandered across the [[Tedim]] - [[Tonzang]] area and finally settled in Saikal area of present-day [[Mizoram]] and [[Churachandpur district]] and other districts of [[Manipur]]. At present the Vaiphei are over thirty thousand in population, outnumbering their brothers who remained in Sizang Valley. The Vaiphei and the Sizang are actually one people separated by international boundaries.  They are descended from Pu [[Zahong]] ([[NuaiMangpa|Nuai Mangpa]]), regarded by many historians as the Chief of the legendary [[Chiimnuai]], the [[Garden of Eden]] of the '''Zo''' people.

==Siyin==
In literature one comes across the name Siyin because the British [[Colonialism|colonial]] officers employed [[Bamar people|Burmese people]], who have social intercourse with the Sizang in the olden days, as interpreters and the word Sizang was corrupted by these interpreters into Siyin. Hence, the [[British people|British]] adopted the name Siyin for the Sizang. However the term Siyin is official and Sizang is local terminology.
