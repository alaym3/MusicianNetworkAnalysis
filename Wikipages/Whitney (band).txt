== Career ==
After the breakup of Smith Westerns in 2014, guitarist Kakacek joined with drummer Julien Ehrlich, who also played drums for [[Unknown Mortal Orchestra]], to form Whitney.<ref name=":0" /> As roommates, the duo shared songwriting duties while Ehrlich became the main vocalist. Initially the band featured members of the Touching Voids, Ehrlich's previous band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rarecandy.org/interviews/2015/8/10/an-interview-with-whitneys-julien-ehrlich|title=An Interview With Whitney's Julien Ehrlich|last=De Martino|first=Susanna|date=August 11, 2015|website=Rare Candy|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> In June 2015, the band made the song "No Matter Where We Go" available digitally through the Lead Riders label.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2015/06/02/members-of-smith-westerns-touching-voids-form-whitney-share-no-matter-where-you-go|title=Members of Smith Westerns, Touching Voids form Whitney, share ‘No Matter Where You Go’|last=Milton|first=Jamie|date=June 2, 2015|website=DIY|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> It included former Smith Westerns member Ziyad Asrar on rhythm guitar, Malcolm Brown on keyboards, bassist Josiah Marshall and brass player Will Miller.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2016/01/18/upstream-whitney?WT.mc_id=620b94180d4d9ac140241a5083765458|title=Upstream: Whitney make country feel fresh and cool|last=Garaas|first=Leah|date=January 18, 2016|website=The Current from Minnesota Public Radio|access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref>

During 2015, the band played around thirty shows, mostly in support of other artists. This included [[Tobias Jesso Jr.]] who got the band in contact with [[Jonathan Rado]], the producer of the album.
