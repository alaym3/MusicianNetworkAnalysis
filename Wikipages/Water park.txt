A '''water park''' or '''waterpark''' is an [[amusement park]] that features water play areas such as [[swimming pool]]s, [[water slide]]s, [[splash pad]]s, water playgrounds, and [[lazy river]]s, as well as areas for floating, bathing, swimming, and other barefoot environments. Modern water parks may also be equipped with some type of artificial [[surfing]] or [[bodyboarding]] environment, such as a [[wave pool]] or [[FlowRider|flowrider]].

==History==
[[File:Waterworld Waterpark - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Children's play area at WaterWorld Themed Waterpark in [[Ayia Napa]], Cyprus]]
Water parks have grown in popularity since their introduction in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The [[United States]] has the largest and most concentrated water park market, with over 1,000 water parks and dozens of new parks opening each year. Major organizations are the [[IAAPA]] (International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions) and WWA ([[World Waterpark Association]]), which is the industry trade association.<ref>[http://www.nfpa.org/press-room/news-releases/2014/nfpa-announces-launch-of-online-smoke-alarm-pledge-in-partnership-with-legoland ]{{dead link|date=March 2019}}</ref>

Water parks which emerge from spas tend to more closely resemble mountain resorts, as they become year-round destinations. For example, [[Splash Universe|Splash Universe Water Park Resort]] is themed to match the community in which it is located. The theme is intended to enhance the community's destination appeal. Therefore, the amusement and leisure-time industry is becoming more concentrated, as winter sports are becoming common themes in summertime water recreation.

A process of concentration can be observed in the hybrid versions of [[theme park|theme-]], [[amusement park|amusement-]], and water parks. Some water parks are more spa-oriented. For example, [[SchwabenQuellen]] has no water slides; it has instead many [[sauna]]s, [[steam room]]s, "adventure showers", and relaxation-oriented water play areas.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In the 2000s, an effort was made to reduce long waiting lines by introducing [[Moving walkway|conveyor belts]] to lift passengers<ref>This feature was applied at [[Caribbean Bay]] Wild River zone, [[Everland Resort]], [[South Korea]]</ref> or use water jets.<ref>This feature was applied at [[Wild Wadi]] in Jumeirah Hotel, [[Dubai]]</ref>

An unusual feature at a water park is [[ice skating]]. [[Deep River Water Park]] in northwestern [[Indiana]] features ice skating, made possible by cooling pipes installed under their massive plaza.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deepriverwaterpark.com/|title=Deep River Waterpark - NW Indiana, Chicagoland & So.

With five indoor water parks, [[Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin]] has been dubbed the "Water Park Capital of the World". It showcases several of America's largest indoor and outdoor water parks, such as [[Noah's Ark Water Park]]. Wisconsin Dells is also home to the first indoor water park in the United States, which was debuted in 1994 by the Polynesian Resort Hotel. <ref>{{Cite web|title=Wisconsin Dells: The Waterpark Capital of the World|url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/wisconsin-dells-waterparks-3224754|access-date=2021-07-25|website=TripSavvy|language=en}}</ref>

Success in extending the tourist season and turning water park resorts into vacation destinations has resulted in tremendous industry growth. Usually, resort hotels featuring massive indoor water parks have been reserved for overnight guests. Companies like [[Great Wolf Resorts]]/Great Wolf Lodge and [[Kalahari Resort]]s have branched out from their origin in Wisconsin Dells to open new locations around the country. Mt. Olympus Theme and Water Park (formerly Family Land) is another huge water park in the Dells.

The largest indoor water park in the UK is [[Sandcastle Water Park (Blackpool)|Sandcastle Water Park]] in [[Blackpool]], England, which opened in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sandcastle-waterpark.co.uk/|title=Sandcastle Waterpark is the UKs Largest Indoor Waterpark|website=www.sandcastle-waterpark.co.uk}}</ref>

There are many water parks in southern Europe where the climate suits a long season. For example, in [[Portugal]]'s [[Algarve]], there are three main parks: Aqualand, Aquashow, and Slide n' Splash.

==Water play areas==
Water play areas are similar to water parks and include [[urban beach]]es, [[splash pad]]s, and smaller collections of [[water slide]]s in many hotels and public [[swimming pool]]s.

For example, the [[Chelsea Hotel, Toronto|Chelsea Hotel]] in [[Toronto]] features a four-story water slide called the Corkscrew.

== Safety ==
According to estimates from the [[U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission]], more than 4,200 people annually are sent to emergency rooms from suffering injuries on public watersides. In July 2015, one drowning and at least three near-drownings were reported at water parks in the United States.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Schneider|first=Roger|date=2016-08-08|title=Safety issues, statistics about water parks in the US|url=https://apnews.com/article/219da8e7a67647608cc00fae13a91583|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-31|website=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref>
