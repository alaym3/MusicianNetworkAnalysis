[[File:Amanda Joy (AJ) Michalka - September 2007.jpg|thumb|160px|left|AJ Michalka in concert in August 2007]]
Aly & AJ's debut studio album, ''[[Into the Rush]]'', was released on August 16, 2005, and certified Gold by the RIAA in March 2006. One of the album's singles, "[[No One (Aly & AJ song)|No One]]", was featured in the [[Walt Disney Pictures]] feature film ''[[Ice Princess]]'' and its soundtrack. The song "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]", written, composed and originally recorded by [[The Lovin' Spoonful]] under [[John Sebastian]], added a rock edge to the album. This cover was used in the soundtrack of the made-for-TV Disney Channel original movie, ''Now You See It...'', in which Aly had a starring role as Allyson Henlen. "[[Do You Believe in Magic (song)|Do You Believe in Magic]]" became their first single to enter the top 20 of the Canadian Hot 100 chart, peaking at No. 23 and at No. 2 on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot Singles Sales]]. ''[[Into the Rush]]'' has sold 839,000 copies in the United States<ref name=billboard2013>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1565751/aly-and-aj-return-as-78violet-announce-hothouse-single|title=Aly and AJ Return As 78Violet, Announce 'Hothouse' Single|publisher=Billboard|access-date=April 25, 2010}}</ref> and one million copies worldwide.<ref name=bmi>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/535793|title=BMI - Aly and AJ|publisher=BMI|access-date=April 25, 2010|date=December 24, 2007}}</ref>

The album received positive reviews from critics. Fran Grauman from [[About.com]] gave the album a four star rating, praising Aly and AJ's "ton of talent" and "experience".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kidsmusic.about.com/od/cdreview1/gr/intotherush.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123213942/http://kidsmusic.about.com/od/cdreview1/gr/intotherush.htm|archive-date = November 23, 2007|title= "Into the Rush" – Aly and AJ | work = [[About.com]]: Children's music | first = Fran | last = Grauman | access-date = January 3, 2009}}</ref> [[Allmusic]] gave the album a mixed review, saying it "doesn't venture further than offering a few empowering ballads", to hand them 2.5 stars after. AMG does praise them for having a real singing ability, citing "Aly & AJ can actually sing – their vocals have more personality than prefab Disney hopefuls like [[Hayden Panettiere]] or [[Caleigh Peters]] – and the arrangements are slick without resorting to flashily empty pap." The review finishes by remarking, ''"[[Into the Rush]]'' is listenable, likeable and more about being memorable than being a Disney product."<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r785145|pure_url=yes}} Into the Rush &gt; Overview] ''AMG.''</ref> The album became the 112th best-selling album in the United States in 2006, earning it a place as No. 112 on the ''Billboard'' 200 end of the year chart of 2006.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=412&cfgn=Year-end |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=March 12, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

The sisters have been involved in various [[Walt Disney Records]] projects. The "Aly & AJ Concert" took place on July 24, 2005 at the [[Henry Fonda]] theater in [[Hollywood, California]]. The aired concert was cut to five songs and interviews, and included songs from ''[[Into the Rush]]''. The sisters opened for [[The Cheetah Girls (band)|The Cheetah Girls]] in December 2005, on the [[The Cheetah Girls tours|Cheetah-licious Christmas Tour]].

The album was re-released in August 2006 with three new songs, including the chart selection "[[Chemicals React]]" and two new versions of "Collapsed" and "Something More". It was also released in the United Kingdom. The sisters released their second studio album, the Christmas-themed ''[[Acoustic Hearts of Winter]]'', on September 26, 2006. On the album, Aly & AJ recorded traditional Christmas songs. In late 2007, the sisters recorded three more original Christmas-themed selections. ''[[Acoustic Hearts of Winter]]'' debuted at No. 78 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, selling over 19,000 copies in its first week. The album also charted the U.S. ''Billboard'' Top Holiday Albums, debuting at No. 14.<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=aly & aj|chart=all}} |title=Aly & AJ Music News & Info |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=May 11, 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100414010653/http://www.billboard.com/artist/mitchel-musso/974867| archive-date= April 14, 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> The holiday album later sold over 110,000 copies in the United States.<ref name=africa>{{cite web|url=http://www.entertainmentafrica.co.za/ea-music/view/rel/7957 |title=Aly and AJ - Acoustic Hearts of Winter: review |publisher=Entertainment Africa |access-date=April 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113100107/http://www.entertainmentafrica.co.za/ea-music/view/rel/7957 |archive-date=January 13, 2016 }}</ref>

=== 2007–2008: ''Insomniatic'' ===
[[File:Alyson Michalka Paparazzo.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Aly Michalka in concert on June 21, 2008 in [[Valdosta, Georgia]]]]
The duo's third studio album, ''[[Insomniatic]]'', was released on July 10, 2007. The album features a more electropop, electronic rock and dance-pop influenced sound different from their debut, with the use of synthesizers, synth-rock guitars, vocoder and electronic instruments. The album peaked at No. 15 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling over 39,000 copies in its first week alone, and becoming Aly & AJ's highest debut to date.<ref name="billboard.com"/> The album sold 700,000 copies in the [[United States]].<ref name=ovguide>{{cite news|url=http://www.ovguide.com/insomniatic-9202a8c04000641f8000000006e3a206# |title=Insomniatic, the third studio album by Aly & AJ |publisher=OV Guide |access-date=January 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325042931/http://www.ovguide.com/insomniatic-9202a8c04000641f8000000006e3a206 |archive-date=March 25, 2014 }}</ref> The album's electropop lead single, "[[Potential Breakup Song]]", had actually preceded their second studio album. ''Insomniatic'', whose selections the Michalka sisters had written and composed themselves, was released on June 25, 2007. "Potential Breakup Song" peaked at No. 17 on ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'s'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], becoming their first top 20 single in the United States.<ref name="Reaction">[http://www.alyandajreaction.net/music/chartarchive/singles.php "Potential Breakup Song" Chart Trajectory on Billboard 200, based on Billboard.com info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722154358/http://www.alyandajreaction.net/music/chartarchive/singles.php |date=July 22, 2009 }}, ''Aly & AJ Reaction''.</ref> The single was later also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for sales surpassing 1&nbsp;million copies.

In October 2007, both the single and the album were released in the United Kingdom; "Potential Breakup Song" reached a peak position of No. 22 in the [[UK Singles Chart|United Kingdom]] and No. 16 in [[Irish Singles Chart|Ireland]]. Aly & AJ toured for a short while in the UK, opening for [[McFly]] twice and performing at several television shows and nightclubs. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named "Potential Breakup Song" one of the 10 Best Songs of 2007, ranking it at No. 9. Writer [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praised the authenticity of its having been written by the teenage sisters who sing it.<ref>Tyrangiel, Josh; "The Best Top 10 Lists of the Year"; "The 10 Best Songs"; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine; December 24, 2007; Page 39.</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1690706,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212162033/http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686244_1690706,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 12, 2007 |title=''Time'' magazine's Top 10 Songs of 2007 at |publisher=Time.com |date=December 9, 2007 |access-date=May 11, 2010}}</ref> The track also went to chart solely on digital download in several countries like the Netherlands, Norway and [[Canada]].

Subsequently, after the success of the album's first single, ''Insomniatic'' was praised by numerous music critics. ''[[USA Today]]'' published an article stating, "for ''Insomniatic,'' the sisters had a hand in writing every song. The single 'Potential Breakup Song' sounds somewhat like [[Del Shannon]]'s '[[Runaway (Del Shannon song)|Runaway]]' run through a processor, but there's a lot more going musically than on your average teen-pop album."<ref name="USA">{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-07-05-aly-AJ_N.htm | title = Aly & AJ pull out all the stops in 'Sweet' sister act | work =[[USA Today]] | date = July 8, 2007 | first = Brian | last = Mansfield|access-date=January 3, 2009}}</ref> [[Hollywood Records]] general manager Abbey Konowitch said, "they write their material; they play their instruments. They aren't in any way manufactured. That's very important."<ref name="USA" /> Fraser McAlpine of [[BBC Radio]] stated, "Aly and AJ's previous album was rock-pop; some of it light and bubbly, some of it bordering on heaviness. Staccato, often angry pop but still definitely pop. Their second offering, 'Insomniatic,' with this as the lead single seems to have kept the staccato and the venom but added more layers of pop, to create something that sounds like [[My Chemical Romance]] going through a blender with some soft-hearted Angry Girl Music." McAlpine also added, "don't let the tango at the start fool you, even as the synths and the vocoder cut in, this is a rock song playing with electronics. Chirpy keyboards flag up the growl of their voices as they deliver self-conscious lines like 'it took too long, it took too long, it took too long for you to call back and normally I would just forget that, except for the fact it was my birthday, my stupid birthday,' kicking a guy to the curb for being a forgetful loser amid a glorious barrage of seething rhythms, clicky noises and general madness, as the Michalka sisters swing between honeyed murmurs and psychosis, making for the most danceable mental breakdown I've heard in quite some time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2007/10/aly_aj_potential_breakup_song_1.shtml |title=Aly & Aj Potential Breakup Song |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=October 4, 2007 |access-date=May 11, 2010}}</ref>

In December 2007, the news revealed that the band would be replacing the [[Jonas Brothers]] as the opening act for the extension of the [[Best of Both Worlds Tour (Miley Cyrus)|Best of Both Worlds Tour]] that [[Miley Cyrus|Destiny Hope "Miley" Cyrus]] had been conducting as [[Hannah Montana]] from January 11–24. The band also confirmed their second single "[[Like Whoa]]", which reached number 63 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and charted later in Australia and Canada.<ref name="Reaction" /> In early January 2008, Aly & AJ performed a cover of [[KT Tunstall]]'s "[[Black Horse and the Cherry Tree]]" on [[Yahoo]]'s [[Pepsi|Pepsi Smash]] video site.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/promo-42778155-53-20071105- |title="Black Horse & the Cherry Tree" video at Yahoo!

Also, Aly & AJ covered the song "[[We're an American Band (song)|We're an American Band]]" for [[Randy Jackson]]'s ''[[Randy Jackson's Music Club, Vol. 1|Music Club, Vol. 1]]''; their interpretation of the [[Grand Funk Railroad]] rock classic served as a bonus track.

== Activism ==
Since their return to music in 2017, the duo have extensively used their platform to advocate for political causes - particularly the advancement of LGBTQ+ rights & the importance of voting, stating in a 2019 interview "It's our job to use our platform for good, whether that's aligning ourselves to great organisations or charities that need our help." Other causes and organisations the pair have voiced support for include the [[Black Lives Matter|Black Lives Matter movement]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=1 June 2020|title=Relevant AF !!!!!!!!! #BlackLivesMatter|url=https://twitter.com/alyandaj/status/1267282786638901248|access-date=8 January 2021|website=Twitter}}</ref> and Planned Parenthood.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=25 January 2017|title=Be understanding & don't judge before you know the facts behind PPact|url=https://twitter.com/alyandaj/status/824361552752971778|access-date=8 January 2021|website=}}</ref>

The pair's 2019 Sanctuary Tour had numerous activist partners.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=12 June 2019|title=Aly & AJ Make Great Pop Songs.

Fans were able to learn more about voter registration and register to vote at the tour's concerts. Another partner was The Trevor Project, an organisation dedicated to youth suicide prevention in the LGBTQ+ community. The duo donated a free meet & greet per show, with fans able to sign a petition to end conversion therapy & donate to the charity to be entered into a prize draw. Also partnered with the tour were Project HEAL, a charity dedicated to increasing access to treatment for eating disorders. The partnership followed a 2018 fundraiser for the charity, with the sisters donating signed merchandise, personalised videos and a meet-up opportunity to be sold and auctioned to raise funds.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Project Heal Fundraiser|url=https://www.classy.org/campaign/help-us-raise-money-to-support-project-heal/c188951|access-date=8 January 2021|website=Classy}}</ref>

The sisters wrote an op-ed for PAPER Magazine in early 2019, revealing their own battles with depression and anxiety in the hopes of raising awareness and removing stigma around mental health medication. The piece also highlighted the particular struggle with self-worth the youth LGBTQ+ community faces, stating "Just within the small community of people who listen to our music exists an unknowable and vast amount of human potential, love, and possibility.

=== Stalking incidents ===
On June 26, 2008, an [[Ohio]] man named Rex Mettler was arrested for stalking the duo. The [[Lancaster, Ohio|Lancaster]] man "obtained contact information for the acting and singing duo and made threats online, by phone and handwritten notes" as stated by the police.<ref name="stalker">{{cite web |url=http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b144537_alleged_aly_aj_stalker_arraigned.html |title=Alleged Aly & AJ Stalker Arraigned |date=June 27, 2008 |last=Grossberg |first=Josh |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080703061023/http://uk.eonline.com/uberblog/b144537_alleged_aly_aj_stalker_arraigned.html |archive-date=July 3, 2008 |access-date=December 16, 2020}}</ref> The duo was scheduled to perform in [[Cincinnati]] on June 27, 2008, where the man was present, after which the police could not confirm that any of the threats involved the Ohio show. The police later stated that "the charge against Mettler stems from incidents that began December 15, 2007" and that "Rex displayed a pattern of activity over that time that reflected multiple attempts, if not numerous attempts, at stalking these females."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2008/06/27/6009671-ap.html |date=June 27, 2008 |title=Aly & AJ stalker arrested |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20090721080455/http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/2008/06/27/6009671-ap.html |archive-date=July 21, 2009 |access-date=December 16, 2020}}</ref>

=== Religion ===
Along with making music for the mainstream audience, Aly & AJ, who are both very open about their faith, were significant in the [[Christian music]] rock scene. "[[Never Far Behind]]" was only released on [[Christian rock]] radio. It went to No. 1 on [[Radio & Records]] (R&R) [[Christian CHR]]. The duo does not wish to be labeled as [[Christian music]] artists. In an interview with ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' magazine in June 2006, Aly & AJ said that their music comes from a Christian perspective. "We don't ever wanna preach or shove anything down people's throats, but we want our music to be inspiring." AJ added, "If we have a Muslim fan or an atheist fan, that's their thing – I'm gonna love them no matter what."<ref name="blender interview">[http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1937 Tweenage Riot.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218214041/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1937 |date=December 18, 2008 }} ''Blender'' magazine, June 2006.</ref>

In 2010, Aly Michalka stated in an interview with ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine, "My faith is definitely a big part of my life, but not part of my career. It is something that guides me. But I feel like when you make a declaration of your religion, people automatically go after you when that [[purity ring]] comes off. So I don't want to set myself up for that kind of judgment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pluggedin.com/cultureclips/2010/2010-09-13.aspx |work=Seventeen |date=September 2010 |title=Culture Clips |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916060939/http://www.pluggedin.com/cultureclips/2010/2010-09-13.aspx |archive-date=September 16, 2010 }}</ref>
