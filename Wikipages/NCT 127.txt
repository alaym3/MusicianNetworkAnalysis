Their debut [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[NCT 127 (EP)|NCT #127]]'' (2016) was a commercial success upon release, winning them the Best New Group title at several South Korean music award shows. Members [[Doyoung (singer)|Doyoung]] and Johnny joined the unit in December 2016, ahead of their second EP ''[[Limitless (NCT 127 EP)|Limitless]]'' (2017); Jungwoo, the final member, was introduced in September 2018 for the group's first [[studio album]] ''[[Regular-Irregular]]'' (2018).

Since their debut, NCT 127 has released three full-length studio albums, two [[Reissue|repackaged albums]], and four extended plays in South Korea. They broke into the mainstream in 2017 with "Cherry Bomb", now recognized as one of their signature songs, and received greater international attention following the release of their first studio album and its lead single "Regular" in 2018. 

In April 2019, the unit's increasing global popularity prompted their label SM Entertainment to sign marketing and distribution deals with [[Capitol Music Group]] and [[Caroline Distribution]] respectively. NCT 127 subsequently released the EP ''[[We Are Superhuman]]'' that year and their second Korean studio album, ''[[Neo Zone]]'', in 2020, the latter becoming their first top-five entry on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and their first release to sell over one million copies.<ref>{{Cite web|title=NCT 127 정규 2집 121만장 밀리언셀러 등극[공식]|url=https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/108/0002864451|website=n.news.naver.com|language=ko|access-date=2020-05-21|archive-date=2020-06-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200626070521/https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/article/108/0002864451|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2021, NCT 127 released their record-breaking third Korean studio album, [[Sticker (album)|''Sticker'']], and its repackage album ''Favorite'', which has sold a total of 3.58 million copies and became the best-selling album of all-time from SM Entertainment.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-24|title=NCT 127’s ‘Sticker’ album sells 2.15 million copies in one week|url=https://mb.com.ph/2021/09/24/nct-127s-sticker-album-sells-2-15-million-copies-in-one-week/|access-date=2021-09-29|website=Manila Bulletin|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-11-04|title=NCTzens’ New ‘Favorite’: NCT 127’s Album Becomes A Million Seller In Record Time!|url=http://en.koreaportal.com/articles/50966/20211104/nctzens-new-favorite-nct-127-s-album-becomes-million-seller.htm|access-date=2021-11-05|website=koreaportal}}</ref> The album also debuted at number 3 on the US ''Billboard'' 200, becoming the highest-ranking K-pop album on the chart in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-09-27|title=NCT 127's 'Sticker' debuts at No. 3 on Billboard 200 albums chart|url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/art/2021/09/732_316056.html|access-date=2021-09-29|website=koreatimes|language=en}}</ref> They have also ventured into the Japanese music scene with a Japanese version of their second single "Limitless", an EP, and a studio album.

In January 2016, SM Entertainment founder Lee Soo-man delivered a presentation at the SM Coex Artium titled "SMTOWN: New Culture Technology 2016".<ref>{{Citation|title=SMTOWN: New Culture Technology, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky5NvWsXnn8|language=en|access-date=2020-05-21|archive-date=2020-05-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200521035114/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ky5NvWsXnn8|url-status=live}}</ref> Lee announced that the label planned to debut a new boy group with an "unlimited" number of members, in alignment with their "[[Cultural technology|culture contents]]" strategy. The group would have "sub-unit teams" of different members from different cities around the world, and the units would collaborate amongst each other frequently. Lee revealed the name of the group to be NCT, an acronym of the presentation title. NCT was to be SM Entertainment's first idol group to debut since [[Red Velvet (group)|Red Velvet]] in August 2014 and the label's first boy group to debut since South Korean–Chinese boy band [[Exo (band)|Exo]] in 2012. During the presentation, Lee also announced plans to debut the first NCT unit within the first half of 2016 in Seoul and Tokyo, with sub-units based in Chinese cities to follow in the latter half of the year and units in Southeast Asia and Latin America later.<ref>{{Cite web|title=SM Entertainment's next boy band to have 'unlimited' members|url=http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201601271758282555044_2|website=kpopherald.koreaherald.com|access-date=2020-05-21|archive-date=2020-05-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518065739/http://kpopherald.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=201601271758282555044_2|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=S.
