She is best known for her [[hit record|hits]] "[[Feel So High]]", "[[You Gotta Be]]", "[[Life (Des'ree song)|Life]]", and "[[Kissing You (Des'ree song)|Kissing You]]" (from the soundtrack of the film ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]''). At the [[1999 Brit Awards]] she received the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Best British female solo artist.

==Early life==
Des'ree was born in [[Croydon]], South East [[London, UK|London]], [[England]],<ref>Nina Myskow, [https://www.thefreelibrary.com/star+challenge%3A+Hanging+on+the+telephone+with...+Des%27ree.-a098788894 "star challenge: Hanging on the telephone with... Des'ree."], ''Daily Mirror'', 15 March 2003</ref> on 30 November 1968.<ref>Briton Hadden, Henry Robinson Luce (1995), ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', Volume 145, Issues 18–26, 1995.</ref><ref>Paul Sexton, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YQ4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14&dq=des%27ree+born+in+london&hl=en&ei=dqWFTIOIDY_HswaBs-WaBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=des%27ree%20born%20in%20london&f=false "550 Music's Des'ree Gets 'Supernatural' On 3rd Set"], ''Billboard'', 13 June 1998.</ref> Her mother is from [[British Guiana]] (now [[Guyana]]), and her father is from [[Barbados]]. She was introduced to [[reggae]], [[calypso music|calypso]] and [[jazz]] music by her parents. At the age of 22, and with no connections in the music industry, she was signed in 1991 to [[Sony 550]] when she asked her boyfriend to send a demo to the label, and they quickly contacted her.

== Career ==
Des'ree's debut single, "[[Feel So High]]", was released in August 1991, a mere 12 weeks after her signing. The single did not initially reach the UK top 40, but hit #13 when it was re-released in January 1992. Her debut album ''[[Mind Adventures]]'' was released in February 1992. It received good reviews and hit the top 30 in the UK. She spent in 1992 touring as the opening act to [[Simply Red]]. In 1993, Des'ree collaborated with [[Sananda Maitreya]] on the song "[[Delicate (Terence Trent D'Arby song)|Delicate]]", which was released as a single and hit the UK top 20 and the US top 100. She ended the year singing with a host of other artists at the first concert of secular music at the [[Vatican City]], on 23 December 1993, which was aired on Italian TV. The concert, named Concerto di Natale, has been held with different artists every Christmas in the years since.

In 1994, her single "[[You Gotta Be]]" hit the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Top 5, peaking at number 5, and was a [[chart-topper|hit]] in the UK three times. "You Gotta Be" became the most played music video on [[VH1]] and remained on the ''Billboard'' Recurrent Airplay Chart for 80 weeks. Following the single's success, Des'ree's second album, ''[[I Ain't Movin']]'', sold in excess of 2.5 million copies worldwide. Her success led to an American tour with [[Seal (musician)|Seal]] in 1995. The following year, she contributed the song "[[Kissing You (Des'ree song)|Kissing You]]" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet]]''. She appears in the film singing the song. In 1997, her song "Crazy Maze" was featured on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Nothing to Lose (1997 film)|Nothing to Lose]]'' with [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Tim Robbins]]. In the same year she provided vocals on "Plenty Lovin''<nowiki/>'"'' on [[Steve Winwood]]'s album ''[[Junction Seven]]''.

In 1998, her single "[[Life (Des'ree song)|Life]]" became a hit in Europe, reaching number 1 in many countries, as well as in Japan. In 1999, she won a [[BRIT Awards|Brit Award]] for the British Female Solo Artist category. The album from which the single was taken, ''[[Supernatural (Des'ree album)|Supernatural]]'', was also released in 1998 to mostly positive reviews. It was somewhat successful in the UK, but was a commercial flop in the United States. In 2007, Des'ree also notably won a BBC poll for the "worst lyrics ever" for the single, the offending lyrics being "I don't want to see a ghost/it's the sight that I fear most/I'd rather have a piece of toast/watch the evening news".<ref>{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6626239.stm | title = Des'ree takes bad lyric top spot | work = BBC | date = 4 May 2007 | access-date = 29 February 2008}}</ref> In 1999, she sang [[The Beatles]]' song "[[Blackbird (Beatles song)|Blackbird]]" at a concert in honour of [[Linda McCartney]]. At the concert, she met the group [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] and she collaborated with them on a cover of "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]", which was released in late 1999. After that, Des'ree put her music career on hold to focus on her private life and disappeared from the public eye.

A compilation of rare songs and live tracks, ''[[Endangered Species (Des'ree album)|Endangered Species]]'', was released in 2000. In 2001 she contributed vocals to the charity single "Wake Up The Morning", which was released in honour of the death of [[Damilola Taylor]]. Billed as Together As One, other contributors to the song were [[Gabrielle (singer)|Gabrielle]], [[Andrew Roachford]] and [[Courtney Pine]]. In 2002, she contributed a sung sonnet from [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[The Merchant of Venice]] to the various artists album ''When Love Speaks''. Sony released ''[[Dream Soldier]]'' in 2003. Only one track from the album was released as a single, "It's Okay", which peaked in the UK at number 69. The single did not chart in the US. The video, directed by [[Jake Nava]], was shot in London's [[Notting Hill]]. "Dream Soldier" was not a critical or commercial success. Des'ree was subsequently dropped by her label, Sony/550 Music, following the release of the album in March 2003.

Shortly afterwards, she took a hiatus from music to focus on her interest in [[naturopathy]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youngvoices.co.uk/what-is-yv/previous-artists/desree|title=Desree|website=Youngvoices.co.uk|access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref> also training as a nutritionist.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=http://www.republicmedia.net/download/files/Des-ree-first-album-since-2003.pdf|title=First Album Since 2003|website=Republicamedia.net|access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref> In 2008 she came out of her hiatus to perform at the [[The O2 Arena|O2 Arena]] for Young Voices' "The Big Sing" charity concert. She helped break the record for "most people simultaneously singing the same song" by leading 600,000 schoolchildren across the United Kingdom in singing "You Gotta Be".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.westerntelegraph.co.uk/news/3931013.big-sing-and-desree-aim-for-a-new-world-record/|title=Pembrokeshire-led Big Sing aims to smash its own record|website=Western Telegraph}}</ref> In 2011, she performed "You Gotta Be" at the wedding for [[George Medal]] recipient Paul Jacobs.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}} That same year, she sung a lullaby on naturopath Julie Langton-Smith's sleep therapy CD ''Sleep Talk Lullaby''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfWM6fXc53A|title=Sleep Hypnotherapy - Sleep Talk Lullaby by Julie LangtonSmith and Des'ree|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=14 October 2019}}</ref>

In September 2019, it was revealed that her fifth album, her first in sixteen years, would be titled ''A Love Story'' and would be released by her own label Stargazer Records on 11 October 2019.<ref name="auto2"/><ref>[https://issuu.com/electriccarp/docs/des_cd_bookletwebfinal] {{dead link|date=October 2019}}</ref> She had begun work on the album in 2012, but took a break to care for her mother.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.garnishmusicproduction.com/uncategorized/desree-does-logic-course/|title=Des'ree Does Logic Course|website=Garnishmusicproduction.com|date=19 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="auto2"/>

==Other work==
"Silent Hero", written by Des'ree and Prince Sampson, featured in [[Spike Lee]]'s 1995 film ''[[Clockers (film)|Clockers]]'', "Feel So High", written by Des'ree and Michael Graves, featured in the 1996 film ''[[Set It Off (film)|Set It Off]]'', and "You Gotta Be" featured in ''[[The Object of My Affection]]'' and ''[[The Next Karate Kid]]''. In 1997, Des'ree's hit "[[Feel So High]]" was interpolated into the [[Janet Jackson]] song "[[Got 'Til It's Gone]]" from Jackson's CD ''[[The Velvet Rope]]'' without due credit to Des'ree as a contributor. The maxi single, however, lists Des'ree and Michael Graves as two of the song's writers,<ref>''Q Magazine'', July 1998.</ref> after winning a lawsuit against Jackson.<ref name="auto">Ian Hyland, [https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Des%27ree+wins+pounds+2m+in+Janet+Jackson+song+copying+war.-a060654272 "Des'ree wins pounds 2m in Janet Jackson song copying war."], ''Sunday Mirror'', 31 May 1998</ref> She also considered suing [[Robyn]] and [[Cleopatra (band)|Cleopatra]] due to the similarities between their songs ("[[Show Me Love (Robyn song)|Show Me Love]]" and "Life Ain't Easy" respectively) and "Feel So High";<ref name="auto"/> however, nothing came of it. In 1999 she recorded a duet with [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]] on a cover of the [[Bill Withers]] song "[[Ain't No Sunshine]]".

== Awards ==
Des'ree has won several awards, including a [[Brit Award]], an [[Ivor Novello Award]], [[World Music Award]], [[Urban Music Award]] and a [[BMI Award]] for over five million plays of "You Gotta Be" in America alone. Des'ree also won a BBC poll for "Worst Pop Lyricist" for the 1998 single "Life", though it went to number 1 in Japan, [[Spain]] and several other European countries.

==Personal life==
Des'ree is a [[vegetarian]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20105736,00.html|title=On the Up and Up|work=PEOPLE.com|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}</ref> In 2002, she did short courses in photography and ceramics at the [[Camberwell College of Arts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/International/Special/Desree/desree2/diary_text.html#2002-6-25|title=des'ree|website=Sonymusic.co.jp}}</ref><ref>[http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/1008-desree Des'ree], ''Metro'', 27 October 2009.
