==Early life==
Born in 1980, in [[Bruges]], Belgium, De Backer emigrated to Australia with his family two years later.<ref name="smh">{{cite web |last=Mathieson |first=Craig |date=30 September 2011 |title=Man in the mirror |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/man-in-the-mirror-20110929-1kxsz.html |access-date=1 March 2012}}</ref> They first resided in [[Sydney]] before settling in [[Montmorency, Victoria|Montmorency]], a suburb of [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].<ref>{{cite interview |last=Dye |first=David |date=18 April 2012 |title=Gotye Interview |work=Conversations from the World Cafe |publisher=WXPN-FM / The Trustees of The University of Pennsylvania |url=https://www.npr.org/player/embed/150507105/155559450}}</ref> His mother nicknamed him "Gotye", based on "Gaultier", the French equivalent of his Dutch name.<ref name=savage/> His parents chose to use the English equivalent of his name, Walter, when enrolling him in school.

As a youth, De Backer displayed a passion for music, learning various instruments, most notably piano and drums. In 2012, De Backer recalled that as a teenager he used to listen "obsessively"
to [[Depeche Mode]]'s album ''[[Songs of Faith and Devotion]]'', stating, "I could single-handedly credit that record with wanting me to make records."<ref>{{cite web|first= Jeff |last= Giles |title= Gotye's Biggest Influences: Depeche Mode, Ween + More |url= http://diffuser.fm/gotye-depeche-mode-ween/ |date= 20 June 2012 |website= Diffuser.fm |access-date= 9 November 2020}}</ref> In his teens, De Backer formed the band Downstares with three of his high school friends,<ref>{{cite web |title=Biography – Gotye |work=iTunes |publisher=Apple Pty Ltd |url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/artist/gotye/id161541223 |access-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> including Lucas Taranto (who still plays in his Gotye live shows).<ref>{{cite web |date=January 2011 |title=Interview |work=Beat |url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/2011/01/11/gotye/footscray-community-art-centre-gotye-laneway-festival-music-feature-national-theatre?quicktabs_1=0 |access-date=14 July 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6IIgF5JAv?url=http://www.beat.com.au/music/2011/01/11/gotye/footscray-community-art-centre-gotye-laneway-festival-music-feature-national-theatre?quicktabs_1=0 |archive-date=22 July 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> After high school, the members of Downstares went their separate ways, leaving De Backer with no musical outlet.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

In 2001, his parents moved into a new home, leaving their old family house in [[Montmorency, Victoria|Montmorency]],<ref>{{cite web |date=August 2008 |title=Interview |publisher=60Sox |url=http://60sox.yodelservices.com/trajectory/view/16 |access-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321011156/http://60sox.yodelservices.com/trajectory/view/16 |archive-date=21 March 2012 }}</ref> so he could continue his studies at the [[University of Melbourne]] where he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.news.unimelb.edu.au/gotye-grabs-number-one-hit-us|title=Gotye grabs number one hit in the US|website=Alumi.news.unimelb.edu.au|access-date=11 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121216100307/http://alumni.news.unimelb.edu.au/gotye-grabs-number-one-hit-us|archive-date=16 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Two friends moved in with him and the house became affectionately known as The Frat House,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://djmaniac.blogspot.com/|title=Early Gotye bio listed on ManiaC music blog| publisher= Blogger|access-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> where friends would regularly drop by and hang out. The first seeds of Gotye were planted when De Backer was given a large collection of old records. An elderly neighbour, having heard Downstares rehearsing over the years, gave his then-recently deceased wife's [[LP record]] collection to De Backer.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_7569000/7569760.stm|title=Interview| website=Bbc.co.uk|date= 19 August 2008 | access-date=14 July 2011|first=Kev|last=Geoghegan}}</ref>

==Career==
===2001–2004: ''Boardface''===
In 2001, De Backer recorded his first tracks primarily using samples. He put together a four-track CD which included the song "Out Here in the Cold".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2yLfCF_OZY| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/w2yLfCF_OZY| archive-date=2021-10-30|title='Out Here in the Cold' film clip |website=YouTube.com |access-date=14 July 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> He made approximately 50 copies of this first collection, handwriting the track list and colouring in the cover sleeve in pencil. He named the project ''Gotye''. He sent the CDs out to every radio station and recording industry contact he could find in the phonebook, then followed each up with phone calls to ensure they were delivered. Feedback on the first release was mainly positive with Melbourne street press and Australian alternative, youth orientated radio station [[Triple J]] taking notice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/homeandhosed/playlist/s1057875.htm |title=Triple J's 'Home and Hosed' – playlist, 1/3/2004 |publisher=[[ABC Online]] |access-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> giving him confidence to continue with further sample-based recordings.

Around this time, Gotye met fellow singer-songwriter Kris Schroeder at a party in Mt Eliza, and the two began performing together under the name [[The Basics (band)|The Basics]]. They formed an enduring songwriting and performing partnership and became regulars on the live music scene, giving De Backer an outlet for his passion for live performance. The Basics have continued to tour and record alongside Gotye, releasing four albums between 2004 and 2010.

De Backer went on to produce two more four-track Gotye collections which were met with positive reviews, with several tracks getting onto the rotation at youth radio station Triple J. The CDs were made in the same style as the first, with De Backer hand crafting each one and tenaciously chasing up every opportunity to get an audience for his work. Interest in the Gotye project was growing, and De Backer was eventually offered a distribution deal by the label company [[Creative Vibes]] for an album, which would essentially be a collection of the tracks from his three earlier releases. The album art is a painting of De Backer's father that was salvaged from his home garden where it was discarded. His album was released as ''[[Boardface]]'' in late 2003.

===2006–2009: ''Like Drawing Blood''===
In 2004, De Backer's parents opted to sell The Frat House and De Backer moved into a shared house in the South East of Melbourne. He took up work at a local library, while continuing to perform with The Basics and record his own Gotye tracks. Over the next few years, De Backer moved several times, each time shifting his home recording studio to a new location with new acoustic qualities. The culmination of this was the second Gotye album, ''[[Like Drawing Blood]]''—named in reference to the difficulties De Backer experienced in recording his music in ever-changing environments.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Like-Drawing-Blood-Gotye/dp/B0018CVRI8 |title=Amazon listing for 'Like Drawing Blood' |website= Amazon.com |access-date=14 July 2011}}</ref> The album marked the beginning of his working relationship with long term manager Danny Rogers – manager of Australian indie band [[The Temper Trap]] – whom he had first approached via email.<ref name="hitquarters.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_DRogers.html |title=Interview With Danny Rogers |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=25 April 2012 |access-date=2 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213213234/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_DRogers.html |archive-date=13 December 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2010–2013: ''Making Mirrors'' and international success===
After the success of ''Like Drawing Blood'', De Backer was able to establish a permanent home, still in Melbourne's south east. In 2010, he set up a recording studio in a barn at his parents' farm and set about recording tracks for his third album. He released a new single, "[[Eyes Wide Open (Gotye song)|Eyes Wide Open]]", online and on 10" vinyl in mid-October 2010. The "Eyes Wide Open" single received generally positive reviews and reached Number 25 on the Triple J Hottest 100 of 2010.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/gotyes-mirrored-vision/2116370.aspx |title= Gotye's Mirrored Vision |newspaper= Bendigo Advertiser |access-date=30 March 2011}}</ref> "Eyes Wide Open" was also shortlisted for the 2011 [[Australasian Performing Right Association|APRA]] [[APRA Awards (Australia)|Music Awards]] in the Song of the Year category.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.themusicnetwork.com/music-news/industry/2011/03/24/apra-reveals-song-of-the-year-contenders-award-details |title= APRA reveals song of the year contenders, award details |publisher=The Music Network |access-date=30 March 2011}}</ref>

In late March 2011, De Backer revealed the next album's title to be ''[[Making Mirrors]]''. The title was inspired by an artwork his father painted in the 1980s, discovered by De Backer among old bills and newspapers in his parents' barn; it was later edited in [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] to become the album artwork. "The mirror reflects on artwork and it is all very related to self-reflection and introspection on the album."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://www.bendigoadvertiser.com.au/news/local/news/general/gotyes-mirrored-vision/2116370.aspx?storypage= |title=Gotye's Mirrored Vision |newspaper=Bendigo Advertiser |access-date=29 March 2011}}</ref> De Backer also revealed that the album would see a release in June or July 2011, with a single to precede the release.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> De Backer also stated that the album would be similar to its predecessor in terms of diversity.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

In a 2018 interview with Australia's ''[[Broadsheet (website)|Broadsheet]]'', De Backer said, "You can dial in an incredibly wide range of sounds on the ondioline, and the unique mechanics for playing it allows you to create sounds very sensitively and with a musical deftness I just feel isn't present on most other electronic instruments from the '40s – or decades since."<ref>[https://www.broadsheet.com.au/sydney/entertainment/article/gotye-makes-his-return-ondioline-what Preston, Sammy, "Gotye Makes His Return with an Ondioline.
