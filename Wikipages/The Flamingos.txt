'''The Flamingos''' are an American [[doo-wop]] group formed in [[Chicago]] in 1953. The band became popular in mid-to-late 1950s and are known for their 1959 cover version of "[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]". They have since been hailed as one of the finest and most influential vocal groups in pop and doo wop music history.<ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/407203/flamingos/biography |title=The Flamingos - Biography |work=Billboard |access-date=March 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Ankeny"/> In 2001, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

==History==
===Early quintet===
Jacob "Jake" Carey (bass) and Ezekiel "Zeke" Carey (second tenor) formed the group in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], United States, after meeting cousins [[baritone]] Paul Wilson and first tenor [[Johnny Carter (singer)|Johnny Carter]] at a [[Church of God and Saints of Christ|Hebrew Israelite]] congregation.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=87/8}}</ref> Earl Lewis (not [[the Channels]] lead) soon joined, and after a series of name changes ("The Swallows", "El Flamingos", "The Five Flamingos"), wound up being known as the Flamingos. Sollie McElroy soon replaced Lewis (who joined the Five Echoes). The Flamingos' first single (for [[Chance Records]]), "If I Can't Have You", was a moderate local success, as was the follow-up "[[That's My Desire (1931 song)|That's My Desire]]", but it was Johnny Carter's composition of "Golden Teardrops", with its complex vocal harmonies and Carter's soaring [[falsetto]], that cemented their reputation as a top regional act of the day.<ref name="Ankeny"/>

The Flamingos left Chance Records sometime after their December 1953 session, and signed with DJ Al Benson's [[Parrot Records (blues label)|Parrot Records]]. Sollie McElroy was on their first Parrot session, but left the group in December 1954, to be replaced by tenor Nate Nelson (who was on their second Parrot session; he's lead on "I'm Yours", released in January 1955).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In early 1955, the Flamingos signed with [[Chess Records]], to record for their [[Checker Records]] [[subsidiary]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> At Chess/Checker, the Flamingos achieved their first national chart hit with "[[I'll Be Home]]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> which went to number 5 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bsnpubs.com/chess/chesscheck.html |title=The Chess Story |website=Bsnpubs.com |date=January 22, 1998 |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref> [[Pat Boone]]'s cover version of the song, complete with incorrect lyrics ("My mind's made up" replacing "My time's about up"), was a hit on the pop charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bsnpubs.com/dot/dotstory.html |title=Dot Records Story, Part 1 |website=Bsnpubs.com |date=November 10, 1999 |access-date=February 12, 2016}}</ref> The group also had moderate success for the label with other chestnuts like "A Kiss from Your Lips", "The Vow" and "Would I Be Crying". The Flamingos also appeared in the 1956 [[Alan Freed]] movie ''[[Rock, Rock, Rock (film)|Rock, Rock, Rock]]''. Both Zeke Carey and Carter were drafted that year (Carter was drafted in September).<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

Nate Nelson, Jake Carey and Paul Wilson continued the group with new member [[Tommy Hunt]] (added in October 1956).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Another new member, tenor/lead, guitarist and [[music arranger|arranger]], [[Terry "Buzzy" Johnson]], joined in late December 1958.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> This group (Nate Nelson, Tommy Hunt, Paul Wilson and Jake Carey) began recording for Decca Records in April 1957. Their most notable single was Johnson's arrangement of "The Ladder of Love", but legal entanglements between Checker and Nate Nelson ruined any chance of commercial success. Zeke Carey returned to the Flamingos in 1958, making the group a [[sextet]]. (When Johnny Carter was discharged from the service, he joined [[the Dells]], performing with them for almost 50 years until his death in 2009.)

Zeke and Jake Carey were not blood-related, but were considered cousins, because of Zeke being adopted by Jake's aunt and uncle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.terryjohnsonsflamingos.com/History.htm  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231171830/http://www.terryjohnsonsflamingos.com/History.htm |archive-date=December 31, 2012 |title=Terry Johnson of Flamingos |access-date=May 16, 2021}}</ref>

===End Records===
In 1958 the Flamingos began recording for [[George Goldner]]'s [[End Records]] in New York City, where they had several national hits.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Almost immediately, the group had their first pop chart hit with "Lovers Never Say Goodbye",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> written by Terry Johnson, who shared lead chores on the song with Paul Wilson. The formula was a winner as Johnson and Wilson  also led three of the 12 songs selected for their first album ''Flamingo Serenade''{{snd}}[[George Gershwin]]'s "[[Love Walked In]]", "[[But Not for Me (song)|But Not for Me]]" and "[[Time Was]]". The Flamingos would have their biggest seller in 1959 with another old standard from that LP, on which Nate Nelson handled lead vocals. "[[I Only Have Eyes for You]]" (written in 1934 by composer Harry Warren and lyricist Al Dubin for the film [[Dames (film)|Dames]]) became their biggest seller,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and has been featured in dozens of movies and TV shows. A long series of hits followed, including the Johnson-penned "Mio Amore", [[Doc Pomus]]' composition "[[Your Other Love]]", "[[Nobody Loves Me Like You]]" (written for the group by [[Sam Cooke]]),<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and "I Was Such a Fool". LP cuts "Love Walked In" and "Time Was" were also issued as singles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  That same year, they appeared in the Alan Freed movie, ''Go, Johnny, Go'', singing a frenetic version of "Jump Children" (originally recorded for [[Chance Records]] in the early days). The group became known almost as much for their stage show and [[choreography]] as for their harmonies. Groups including [[the Temptations]]<ref>{{Cite book |first=Todd |last=Decker |title=The Lives of an American Song |year=2014 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9mSBAAAQBAJ&pg=PT218 |page=218 |isbn=978-0199389193 |publisher=Ebook}}</ref> and [[Tavares (band)|the Tavares]] would later credit the group as major influences.

===Splintering===
The group began to come apart at the turn of the decade. Tommy Hunt left for a solo career in 1960. Nate Nelson and Terry Johnson split to form the "Modern Flamingos" in 1961, and went on to record as the Starglows on [[Atco Records]] in 1963. (The Modern Flamingos name was used later; the group would include members of the defunct Del-Knights in the late 1960s). New members were brought in, making the group Zeke Carey (tenor), Jake Carey (bass), Paul Wilson (baritone), Billy Clarke (tenor), [[Eddie Williams (saxophonist)|Eddie Williams]] (tenor), Alan Fontaine (guitar), and Julien Vaught (saxophone).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.julienandellavaught.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929072322/http://www.julienandellavaught.com/ |title=Julien Vaught |website=Julienvaught.com |archive-date=May 16, 2021 |access-date=May 16, 2021}}</ref> Also [[Johnny Carter (singer)|Johnny Carter]] left in 1960 to join [[the Dells]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Clarke and Williams took duties on most new lead vocals.

A sixth vocalist, Doug McClure, was added in 1962. Shortly afterwards, Clarke and Williams left the group. Founding member Paul Wilson left in 1964, new member Sidney Hall joined in 1966, and Jacob Carey's son J.C. Carey joined in 1969.<ref name="worcestermag">[http://www.worcestermagazine.com/content/view/2063/30/] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> They recorded several uptempo songs through the 1960s, peaking at number 26 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "The Boogaloo Party".<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The group continued recording into the 1970s. A new album was released in 1972 on Ronze, entitled ''The Flamingos Today''. By this time, the group was the Careys, McClure, Fontaine, the returning Billy Clarke, and former [[Shep and the Limelites|Limelite]] Clarence Bassett, Jr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassettbranches.org/newsletters/2006/20060521/20060521.shtml |title=Bassett Family Association Newsletter May 2006 |website=Bassettbranches.org |access-date=March 2, 2014}}</ref> New member Frank "Mingo" Ayers joined soon after.<ref name="rockabillynl">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabilly.nl/references/messages/flamingos.htm |title=Flamingos |website=Rockabilly.nl |access-date=March 2, 2014}}</ref> More mildly successful recordings came in this decade, including the uptempo "Heavy Hips", and "Buffalo Soldier".<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

The group recorded a new album, ''Unspoken Emotions'', under the Ronze label in 1999. It featuring re-recordings of "Ain't Nothing But A Party" and "I'll Be Home", led by Zeke Carey. The group appeared on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television special ''[[Doo Wop 50]]'' that same year. The lineup was Zeke Carey, J.C. Carey, Ron Reace, King Raymond Green, and [[Larry Jordan]]. Zeke Carey died on December 24, 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/doowo1/p/flamingos.htm |title=Profile: The Flamingos |first=Robert |last=Fontenot |website= About.com |access-date=November 13, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/17849718 |title=Zeke Carey |first= John |last=Griffith |year=2007 |work=Find a Grave |access-date=November 13, 2013}}</ref> King Raymond Green and Ron Reace left around that time and were replaced by Earnest "Just Mike" Gilbert and former [[The Dynamic Superiors|Dynamic Superior]] George Spann. James Faison entered shortly thereafter. Tommy Hunt has flown in from England (where he has lived since 1970) to perform with this group twice since 2001.
