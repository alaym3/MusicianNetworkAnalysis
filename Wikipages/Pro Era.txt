==History==

===Music career===

====2008–2011: The 3rd Kind and formation of Pro Era====
[[Capital STEEZ]], then known as Jay STEEZ, had started recording music around 2008. During those times STEEZ was also a part of a rap duo called The 3rd Kind along with childhood friend, Jakk the Rhymer. The 3rd Kind released their only mixtape, ''The Yellow Tape'', in 2009.

In the spring of 2011, while still a student at [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], Capital STEEZ had a performance at a cafe in [[Clinton Hill, Brooklyn]], with friends including Powers Pleasant, [[Joey Badass]] and Dirty Sanchez also in attendance to show him support.<ref name="LA Weekly">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/joey-bada-and-pro-era-turn-tragedy-into-celebration-with-their-annual-steez-day-festival-7093577 |title=Joey Bada$$ and Pro Era Turn Tragedy Into Celebration With Their Annual Steez Day Festival |date=July 5, 2016 |first=Tara |last=Mahadevan |work=[[LA Weekly]] |access-date=August 30, 2016}}</ref> On their way home from the performance, he and Powers Pleasant came up with the idea of forming a hip hop collective, which they named "Progressive Era", or "Pro Era" for short.<ref name="The Fader">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefader.com/2013/11/26/capital-steez-king-capital |title=Capital STEEZ: King Capital |date=November 26, 2013 |first=Eli |last=Rosenberg |work=[[The Fader]] |access-date=August 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160830232255/http://www.thefader.com/2013/11/26/capital-steez-king-capital |archive-date=August 30, 2016 }}</ref> In addition to the two co-founders, Joey Badass, Dirty Sanchez and [[CJ Fly]] were brought into the group as founding members.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/05/who-is-joey-badass/ |title=Who Is Joey Bada$$? |date=May 9, 2012 |first=Daniel |last=Isenberg |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |access-date=September 3, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/joey-badass-1999/ |title=Joey Bada$$ Travels Through Astroplanes |date=June 6, 2012 |first=Anthony |last=Badami |work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |access-date=September 3, 2016}}</ref>

==47 logo controversy==
[[File:47 (Pro Era).svg|thumb|right|180px|The "47" symbol associated with Pro Era]]
The design of one of Pro Era's logos is [[47 (number)|the number 47]] with its digits joined together.<ref name="47 symbol">{{cite web |url=http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/controversial-symbol-shows-up-along-avenue-k-in-midwood-1.7483273 |title=Controversial symbol shows up along Avenue K in Midwood |work=[[News 12 Brooklyn]] |publisher=News 12 Brooklyn |date=24 March 2014 |access-date=21 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706121008/http://brooklyn.news12.com/news/controversial-symbol-shows-up-along-avenue-k-in-midwood-1.7483273 |archive-date=July 6, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

It has sparked controversy due to its similarity to the [[Nazi flag]]. Like the Nazi flag, the logo has a red field with a solid white circle and a black insignia. Instead of a [[swastika]], the circular white field of the sticker contains the 47 symbol, which bears close resemblance to the swastika and to a [[wolfsangel]], both of which are associated with [[Nazism]] and [[Neo-Nazism]]. Stickers of the logo and [[graffiti]] of the symbol appeared in numerous locations around [[Edward R. Murrow High School]] and the Brooklyn neighborhood of [[Midwood, Brooklyn|Midwood]] (where the school is located) in March 2014, being planted by members of Pro Era to honor the memory of the late Capital STEEZ. 

According to local news station ''[[News 12 Brooklyn]]'', the group has explained that the logo was designed the way it was to draw attention, and that the symbol resembles peace, love and balance, as with the swastika's significance in various religions. They say that it is supposed to be a spiritual symbol and not an offensive one. Capital STEEZ believed that the logo's resemblance of a swastika is a commentary on the appropriation of what was originally a peaceful & spiritual symbol with roots in Eastern religions.<ref name="The Fader" />
