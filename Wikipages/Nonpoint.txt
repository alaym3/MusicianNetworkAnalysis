==History==

===Early years (1997–2004)===
[[File:Nonpoint Logo.svg|thumb|The band logo]]
Nonpoint was formed in January 1997 emerging from the popular burgeoning South Florida metal scene of the mid-to-late 1990s by drummer Robb Rivera and vocalist Elias Soriano. The name Nonpoint came from a [[Believer (band)|Believer]] song named "Nonpoint." Soriano recalls: "I dug the name so I started using it around that time. It has no real meaning to us. It has something to do with pollution, but to us it just sounded cool."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Randy|title=Nonpoint Interview|url=http://rockpublication.com/nonpointinterview.htm|website=Rock Publication|access-date=October 27, 2015|date=March 1, 2001}}</ref> The band self-released their first album, ''Separate Yourself'' in late 1997. The band's first commercially released album ''[[Struggle (Nonpoint album)|Struggle]]'' was released on May 18, 1999 on the now-defunct Jugular Records.

The band released their debut [[major label]] album ''[[Statement (album)|Statement]]'' on October 10, 2000 via [[MCA Records]].
