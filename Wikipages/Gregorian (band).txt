'''Gregorian'''  is a  German [[Band (music)|band]] headed by [[Frank Peterson]] that performs [[Gregorian chant]]-inspired versions of modern [[pop music|pop]] and [[rock music|rock]] songs. The band features both vocal harmony and instrumental accompaniment. They competed in Unser Lied für Stockholm [[Germany in the Eurovision Song Contest 2016|the German national selection]] for the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2016]] with the song "Masters of Chant". They placed 5th in the first round of the public voting, missing the top 3. They gained 9.06% of the public vote.

== Band history ==
Originally, Gregorian was conceived as a more pop-oriented group in the vein of [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]]. Under this concept, Peterson together with Matthias Meissner and Thomas Schwarz, recorded the 1991 album ''[[Sadisfaction]]'', with lead vocals provided by [[The Sisters of Oz]]: Susana Espelleta (Peterson's wife at the time) and Birgit Freud. However, this was the only album by the trio in that style.

In 1998, Peterson and his team of Jan-Eric Kohrs, Michael Soltau and Carsten Heusmann re-invented the project to perform popular songs in the [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]] style. The criteria for song selection were strict; in order to be considered, a song needed to be translatable into the 7-tone scale. For each album, songs were carefully chosen in addition to original songs written by Jan-Eric Kohrs, Amelia Brightman and Carsten Heussman. Twelve vocalists - previously acclaimed session and choir singers - were then hired to record the tracks.

Each Gregorian album was initially digitally tracked at Nemo Studios, Peterson's [[Hamburg]] studio. The vocalists then record their parts in a church atmosphere with dimmed lights and candles, in order to escape what Peterson referred to in a 2001 interview as the "cold and technical" studio atmosphere.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theage.com.au/entertainment/2001/08/26/FFXR2DDASQC.html  |title=Q&A: Frank Peterson |publisher=[[The Age]] |date=2001-08-26 |access-date=2006-08-06 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20010828182429/http://theage.com.au/entertainment/2001/08/26/FFXR2DDASQC.html |archive-date = 2001-08-28}}</ref>

The concept proved to be successful, and the group proceeded to record several more ''[[Masters of Chant]]'' albums in the same style. Their 2004 album, ''[[The Dark Side (Gregorian album)|The Dark Side]]'', was a slight departure from the others, featuring a darker repertoire. In 2005, ''The Masterpieces'', a [[compilation album]] with a live DVD, was released. A [[Masters of Chant Chapter V|fifth ''Masters of Chant'' album]] was released on 31 March 2006. In 2006, a festive album was also released, titled ''[[Christmas Chants]]''. A [[Masters of Chant Chapter VI|sixth ''Masters of Chant'' album]] was released on 28 September 2007. In 2009, a [[Masters of Chant Chapter VII|seventh ''Masters of Chant'' album]] followed. On 8 September 2010 the next album, titled ''[[Dark Side of the Chant|The Dark Side of Chant]]'', was announced to be published on 15 October 2010.<ref name="darksideofchant">[http://www.gregorian-music.com/en/component/content/article/144-news/255-die-perfekte-verschmelzung-gregorianischen-gesangs-mit-pop-und-rock-live-auf-tour.html The announcement of the new album] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110319072234/http://www.gregorian-music.com/en/component/content/article/144-news/255-die-perfekte-verschmelzung-gregorianischen-gesangs-mit-pop-und-rock-live-auf-tour.html |date=2011-03-19 }}, ''[[Dark Side of Chant]]''.</ref> In 2012, ''Epic Chants'' was published with the collaboration of the Russian newcomer Eva Mali, in 2015 the tenth album from the ''Masters of Chant'' series was released, titled ''Masters of Chant X: The Final Chapter'', in 2016, ''Live!
