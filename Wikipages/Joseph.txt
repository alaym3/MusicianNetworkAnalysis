==Etymology==
The Bible offers two explanations of the name ''Yosef:'' first, it is compared to the word ''asaf'' from the root /'sp/, "taken away": "And she conceived, and bore a son; and said, God hath ''taken away'' my reproach"; ''Yosef'' is then identified with the similar root /ysp/, meaning "add": "And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall ''add'' to me another son."<ref name ="Friedman, 80">Friedman, R. E., ''The Bible with Sources Revealed'' (2003), p. 80</ref> ''[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]]'' says that it is a [[theophoric]] name referencing [[YHWH]].<ref>{{cite web |title=JOSEPH|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8803-joseph |website=[[The Jewish Encyclopedia]] |publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com |access-date=10 March 2015}} "like all other Hebrew names beginning with the syllable 'Jo,' it has Yhwh as its first element".</ref> The name can also consist of the Hebrew ''yadah'' meaning "praise", "fame" and the word ''asaf''.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}
