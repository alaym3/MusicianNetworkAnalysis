'''Theodore Anthony Nugent''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|dʒ|ᵻ|n|t}}; born December 13, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, guitarist and activist.

===Draft status===
Nugent grew up in a military family; his father was a career army sergeant. Nugent himself never served in the military, even though he came of age during the height of the [[Vietnam War]]. In two 1977 and 1990 interviews with ''[[High Times]]'' magazine and the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'', Nugent claimed he deliberately failed his draft physical by eating nothing but junk food for days beforehand and [[defecation|defecating]] and urinating in his pants.<ref name=auto2>{{Cite news|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/military/nugent.asp|title=Ted Nugent Dodged the Draft?|date=April 20, 2012|website=Snopes.com|access-date=August 15, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=MM>{{cite web|url=https://www.mediamatters.org/blog/2014/03/26/the-worst-ted-nugent-interview-of-all-time/198607|title=The Worst Ted Nugent Interview Of All Time|date=March 25, 2014|website=Media Matters|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref><ref name=DFP>{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/214489436/ted-nugent-grows-up-the-detroit-free-press-magazine-july-15-1990|title="Ted Nugent Grows Up?" The Detroit Free Press Magazine, July 15, 1990|website=Scribd.com|access-date=September 7, 2018}}</ref>

Nugent denied his defecation story in a 2018 appearance on ''[[The Joe Rogan Experience]]''; he asserted that he invented the story for his and his band's amusement, as he claimed news sources at the time often published inaccurate information on his band. He also claimed that he was in fact eligible for military service and passed a draft physical in 1969 while he was attending [[Oakland Community College]]. Nugent falsely stated that his 4-F rating on Wikipedia was "made up".<ref name=auto3>{{cite web|title=Joe Rogan Experience #1138 - Ted Nugent|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Yp6ZdCIE3k|publisher=YouTube|access-date=July 4, 2018|date=June 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/buster/ted-nugent-draft-dodger-467132|title=Gun Enthusiast Ted Nugent Wasn't Anxious To Bear Arms Against Those Pesky Vietcong|date=February 12, 2013|website=Thesmokinggun.com}}</ref> On ''The Joe Rogan Experience'', Nugent further claimed that he told the excrement story to the ''High Times'' just to have fun with its "dirtbag" and "[[hippie]]" writers in 1977 because he was "hardcore anti-drug", however in 1990 he again detailed his experiences "living inside pants caked with his own [[excrement]]" for one week to avoid the draft in an extensive 1990 interview with the ''Detroit Free Press'' after the formation of Damn Yankees.<ref name=MM /><ref name=DFP /><ref name=auto3 /> He further stated on ''The Joe Rogan Experience'' that in 1969 he passed his draft physical "with flying colors."<ref name=auto3 />

Nugent's [[Selective Service]] classification record (Selective Service No. 11-101-48-1792<ref name=draftrecord />) shows he initially qualified for and took [[student deferment]]s.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord /> When he was no longer enrolled in community college, he received a draft rating of I-A, until he failed his draft physical on August 28, 1969.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord /> After that physical, he was rated 1-Y ("registrant qualified for service only in time of war or national emergency") until that classification was abolished in 1971.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord /> He was subsequently reclassified 4-F, indicating ineligibility for military service under established physical, mental, or moral standards.<ref name=auto2 /><ref name=draftrecord /> The 1-Y and 4-F classifications were usually reserved for those with significant medical or mental issues.<ref name=draftrecord />

Nugent told the ''Detroit Free Press'' in 1990 that if he had gone to Vietnam, he'd probably have either been killed or would have killed "everybody" including "all the hippies in the foxholes" with [[friendly fire]].<ref name=DFP />

==Musical career==
[[File:TedNugentPerforming.jpg|left|thumb|upright=0.9|Nugent in concert with his signature Gibson Byrdland guitar]]

===The Amboy Dukes===
The first lineup of [[the Amboy Dukes]] played at [[The Cellar (teen dance club)|The Cellar]], a teen dance club outside of Chicago in [[Arlington Heights, Illinois]], starting in late 1965, while Nugent was a student at [[St. Viator High School]]. The Cellar's "house band" at the time had been [[the Shadows of Knight]], although the Amboy Dukes eventually became a staple until the club's closing.<ref>[http://www.tednugent.com/hunting/news/2008/default.aspx?PostID=539794]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

The Amboy Dukes' second single was "[[Journey to the Center of the Mind (song)|Journey to the Center of the Mind]]", which featured lyrics written by the Dukes' second guitarist [[Steve Farmer (musician)|Steve Farmer]] from the [[Journey to the Center of the Mind|album of the same title]] whose cover features a diverse array of drug paraphernalia. Nugent, an ardent anti-drug campaigner, has always claimed that he had no idea that this song was about drug use.<ref name="Ref-1">{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-nugent-idUSTRE53A00C20090411 |last=Graff |first=Gary |title=Ted Nugent reuniting Amboy Dukes for Detroit event |work=Reuters |date=April 11, 2009 |access-date=December 15, 2012}}</ref> ''The Amboy Dukes'' (1967), ''Journey to the Center of the Mind'' (1968), ''Migration'' and ''[[Rusty Day]]'' (1969)—all recorded on the Mainstream label—sold moderately well. On April 5, 1968, the day after the [[assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.]], Nugent joined other musicians in a tribute to King by having a folk, rock and blues [[jam session]]. [[Joni Mitchell]] played first, followed by [[Buddy Guy]], [[Cactus (American band)|Cactus]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. Other musicians who participated were [[BB King]] and [[Al Kooper]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jonimitchell.com/chronology/byyear.cfm?year=1968|title=Joni Mitchell's Chronology of Appearances, 1968|publisher=Jonimitchell.com|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>

After settling down on a ranch in Michigan in 1973, Nugent signed a record deal with [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[DiscReet Records]] label and recorded ''[[Call of the Wild (Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes album)|Call of the Wild]]'' under the revised band name Ted Nugent and the Amboy Dukes. The following year, ''[[Tooth Fang & Claw]]'' (which contained the song "Great White Buffalo") established a fan base for Nugent and the other Amboy Dukes. Personnel changes at this time nearly wrecked the band. Nugent reunited with the other members of the Amboy Dukes at the 2009 Detroit Music Awards, which took place April 17, 2009. The [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] band received a distinguished achievement honor at the event. The Dukes also played together at the ceremony, marking their first public performance in more than 30 years.<ref name="Ref-1" />

===Solo career===
{{See also|Ted Nugent discography}}

Nugent dropped the Amboy Dukes band name for good in 1975 and signed to [[Epic Records]]. Retaining only bassist [[Rob Grange]] from the previous Amboy Dukes lineup, Nugent added [[Derek St. Holmes]] (guitar, vocals) and [[Clifford Davies]] (drums). This quartet remained the primary band members for Nugent's 1970s multi-platinum<ref name="TedNugentASearch">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Ted%20Nugent&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50|title=RIAA Gold and Platinum Search for albums by Ted Nugent|publisher=Riaa.com|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref> albums: ''[[Ted Nugent (album)|Ted Nugent]]'' (1975), ''[[Free-for-All (Ted Nugent album)|Free-for-All]]'' (1976) and ''[[Cat Scratch Fever]]'' (1977). These albums produced the popular radio anthems "Hey Baby", "[[Stranglehold (Ted Nugent song)|Stranglehold]]", "Dog Eat Dog" and "[[Cat Scratch Fever (song)|Cat Scratch Fever]]". Despite most of the songwriting credits being listed as solely Nugent, St. Holmes claims that many were co-written by the whole band and that Nugent took sole credit as a way to avoid paying them royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CTb_yory7tc|title=Ep. 260 Derek St. Holmes, The Voice of Ted Nugent Remembers Touring with KISS in the 70s|last=Michael Brandvold|date=December 26, 2017|access-date=August 10, 2018|publisher=YouTube}}</ref>

It was during these three years that Nugent emerged as a guitar hero to hard rock fans, many of whom were unaware of his lengthy apprenticeship with the Amboy Dukes.<ref>Charlesworth, Chris. ''A-Z of Rock Guitarists'', pg. 65</ref> This band lineup toured extensively, also releasing the multi-platinum live album ''[[Double Live Gonzo!]]'' (1978), until its breakup in 1978 when St. Holmes and Grange departed. St. Holmes was replaced by [[Charlie Huhn]] and Grange by multiple bassists, with Nugent eventually settling on Dave Kiswiney for a three-album stretch in the 1980s. Davies left around 1982 after staying on to record ''[[Weekend Warriors (album)|Weekend Warriors]]'' (1978), ''[[State of Shock (Ted Nugent album)|State of Shock]]'' (1979) and ''[[Scream Dream]]'' (1980), all three of which charted in the US Top 25, plus the live album ''[[Intensities in 10 Cities]]'' (1981). The ''Intensities in 10 Cities'' album includes the controversial song "Jailbait".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Womack|first1=Larry|title=Ted Nugent's Jailbait Problem|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/larry-womack/ted-nugents-jailbait-problem_b_4840060.html|access-date=September 13, 2015|work=Huffington Post|date=April 25, 2014}}</ref>

On July 8, 1979, Ted was on the rock radio program ''[[King Biscuit Flower Hour]]''. This was the original broadcast of Ted's performance of ''[[Live at Hammersmith '79]]'' which had been recorded during the second set of a night at London's [[Hammersmith Odeon]] in 1979. An album of this program was released in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/audio/?fa=contributor:nugent,+ted&all=true|title=Search results from Audio Recording, Nugent, Ted|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

===1980s solo career and Damn Yankees===
During the period of 1982{{ndash}}1988, Nugent released four more solo albums (to declining critical favor and commercial performance) and also began assuming a more prominent role as lead vocalist. In 1989, he joined the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Damn Yankees (band)|Damn Yankees]], with [[Jack Blades]] (bass/vocals, of [[Night Ranger]]), [[Tommy Shaw]] (guitar/vocals, of [[Styx (band)|Styx]]) and [[Michael Cartellone]] (drums). ''[[Damn Yankees (album)|Damn Yankees]]'' (1990) was a hit album, going double platinum in the U.S.,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1992-08-20-9203160169-story.html|title=DAMN YANKEES TO HIT THE ROAD AND NOT LET UP|author=Chris Morris|website=Chicagotribune.com}}</ref> thanks to the hit power ballad "[[High Enough]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/damn-yankees|title=Damn Yankees Chart History|website=Billboard.com}}</ref> The second and final Damn Yankees album, ''[[Don't Tread]]'' (1992), reached gold status in the U.S., but was not as well-received as the band's debut and the group dissolved soon after.

===Return to solo career===
[[File:Ted Nugent.jpg|right|thumb|Nugent performing in 2005]]
Returning to a solo career, Nugent released ''[[Spirit of the Wild]]'' in 1995, his best-reviewed album in quite some time. The album contained the bowhunting anthem "Fred Bear", and also marked the return of Derek St. Holmes to Nugent's studio band. A series of archival releases also came out in the 1990s, keeping Nugent's name in the national consciousness. He also began hosting a radio show in Detroit on [[WDKL (FM)|WWBR-FM]] ("102.7 The Bear, Detroit's Rock Animal") and took ownership in several hunting-related businesses. He created TV shows for several networks; ''[[Wanted: Ted or Alive]]'' on [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]], ''Ted Nugent Spirit of the Wild'' on PBS and The Outdoor Channel, as well as ''Surviving Nugent'' and ''[[Supergroup (TV series)|Supergroup-Damnocracy]]'' on VH1. In 2006, Ted Nugent was voted into the Michigan Rock and Roll Legends Hall of Fame.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com/mrrl-hall-of-fame/89-ted-nugent|title=Michigan Rock and Roll Legends - TED NUGENT|first=OJ|last=Advertising|website=www.michiganrockandrolllegends.com|access-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref>

On March 14, 2011, Nugent released a new song, "I Still Believe", as a free download via his website to subscribers to his newsletter. Nugent says of the song: "America is a target-rich environment for an independent man addicted to logic, truth and The American Way. 'I Still Believe' throttles the animal spirit of rugged individualism in pure MotorCity ultra high-energy rhythm and blues and rock and roll."<ref name="Blabber">{{cite web|website=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=155281|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201191511/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=155281|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 1, 2013|title=Ted Nugent: New Song Available For Free Download, March 14, 2011|access-date=March 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name="TedNugentwebsite">{{cite web|website=TedNugent.com|url=http://www.tednugent.com/mailinglist|title=SIGN UP & GET A FREE MP3 OF I STILL BELIEVE|access-date=March 19, 2011}}</ref> In April 2011 Nugent announced that former frontman Derek St. Holmes would be joining his band for Nugent's I Still Believe Tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/News/Derek-St-Holmes-0404-2011/|title=Gibson Lifestyle, 2011|publisher=Gibson.com|date=June 24, 2008|access-date=October 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113060352/http://www.gibson.com/en%2Dus/Lifestyle/News/Derek%2DSt%2DHolmes%2D0404%2D2011/|archive-date=January 13, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Media appearances==
===Reality TV===
Nugent has starred in his own outdoors television show on the [[Outdoor Channel]], named after his popular song "[[Spirit of the Wild]]", since 2001. The song was the theme music to the TV series, in which Nugent took viewers on a variety of wild game hunts using his bow. In the series, he taught and advised hunters and "hands-on" conservationists around the world on the different aspects of hunting and politics.<ref>[http://www.outdoorchannel.com/Shows/TedNugent.aspx Spirit of the Wild]. Outdoor Channel.</ref> In one episode of ''Spirit of the Wild'', Nugent hits a young deer with a bow. Two game wardens saw the episode, later charging Nugent with 11 misdemeanor violations of California hunting law. Nugent plead guilty to two violations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article24590587.html|title=Ted Nugent charged with 11 deer hunting violations in California|website=Mcclatchydc.com|access-date=May 20, 2018}}</ref>

In 2003, he was host of the [[VH1]] reality television program ''[[Surviving Nugent]],'' in which city dwellers such as model [[Tila Tequila]] moved to Nugent's Michigan ranch in order to survive such "backwoods" activities as building an [[outhouse]] and [[skinning]] a boar.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} The success of the two-hour show spawned a four-part miniseries in 2004, titled ''Surviving Nugent: The Ted Commandments.'' This time it was filmed on Nugent's ranch in [[China Spring, Texas]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} During filming, Nugent injured himself with a chainsaw, requiring 44 stitches and a leg brace.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2003, Nugent also guested on the VH1 program ''[[Forever Wild]],'' hosted by [[Sebastian Bach]], former lead vocalist for the band [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]]. They shot some firearms and walked around Nugent's cabin in the woods. Two years later, in 2005, Nugent hosted a reality-type show, ''Wanted: Ted or Alive,'' on what was then called the OLN, or Outdoor Life Network, before it became the [[NBC Sports Network]] of the present day.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} In ''Wanted: Ted or Alive,'' contestants competed for money as well as for opportunities to go hunting with "Uncle Ted". The contestants had to kill and clean their own food to survive.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2006, he appeared on VH1's reality show ''[[Supergroup (TV series)|SuperGroup]],'' with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] guitarist [[Scott Ian]], [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]] bassist [[Evan Seinfeld]], ex-[[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] lead singer [[Sebastian Bach]] and [[John Bonham]]'s son [[Jason Bonham]], who had been the drummer for [[Bonham (band)|Bonham]], [[UFO (band)|UFO]] and [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]. The name of the supergroup was originally FIST but later was changed to [[Damnocracy]]. Bach had lobbied for the name Savage Animal. Captured on film by VH1 was a rare Nugent duet with guitarist [[Joe Bonamassa]] at the [[Sand Dollar Blues Room]] for a 45-minute blues jam. He starred in another reality show for [[Country Music Television|CMT]] in August 2009. The show, titled ''Runnin' Wild ... From Ted Nugent,'' featured Nugent instructing competitors in the art of survival; the competitors had to use those skills in challenges in which Nugent himself hunted them down.<ref>[http://www.cmt.com/news/news-in-brief/1608368/runnin-wild-from-ted-nugent-competition-series-coming-to-cmt.jhtml Runnin Wild From Ted Nugent Series Coming to CMT] CMT.com, April 2, 2009</ref>

In 2008, Nugent was a guest on the episode ''Southwest Road Trip Special'' of ''[[Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations]],'' where he spoke against obesity and [[public health care]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelchannel.com/Video/tony-chews-the-fat-with-ted-nugent-11738|title=Tony chews the fat with Ted Nugent|work=Anthony Bourdain: No Reservations|publisher=The Travel Channel L.L.C.|access-date=August 22, 2011}}</ref>

Also in 2009, Nugent played guitar at [[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] for a [[Tax Day Tea Party]] hosted by [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]. Most notable in his set was a version of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" in which he used [[alternate picking]] and [[whammy bar]] effects. The clip and sound bite of this came to be played extensively on Fox News as well as on ''[[The Glenn Beck Program]].''{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

===Acting===
In 1976, Nugent was in the documentary ''Demon Lover Diary'', about the making of the [[John Dods]]' horror/comedy movie ''The Demon Lover''. He is shown supplying real guns for the making of ''The Demon Lover'', as the crew films at Nugent's house.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 1986, he guest starred in an episode of the hit television show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' entitled "Definitely Miami". Nugent played a villain. His song "Angry Young Man" was featured in the episode. His song "Little Miss Dangerous" was also featured on a ''Miami Vice'' episode of the same name, although he did not appear in the episode.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2001, Nugent appeared as himself in a third-season episode of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' entitled "Backstage Pass". Donna Pinciotti ([[Laura Prepon]]), who works for radio station WFPP, obtains tickets to the upcoming Ted Nugent concert for the entire gang. Following the concert, her boss Max ([[Howard Hesseman]]) gives Donna a backstage pass to meet Nugent, where he volunteers to sit for an interview. Meanwhile, Steven Hyde ([[Danny Masterson]]) and Fez ([[Wilmer Valderrama]]) try to sell unauthorized concert [[t-shirts]] accidentally spelled ''Tad Nugent''.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Also in 2001, Nugent appeared as himself in the second episode of the short-lived university campus [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] comedy series, ''[[Undeclared]]''. In the episode "Full Bluntal Nugety", Nugent is a guest at the university, there to speak on his favorite topics, mainly hunting and gun control. This is where new student Steven Karp ([[Jay Baruchel]]) takes his love interest Lizzie ([[Carla Gallo]]) on their first date. Karp tries to heckle Nugent during his speech in an attempt to impress Lizzie, with disastrous results. FOX didn't like the idea of Nugent and his political views appearing on this show, so the episode was re-shot and re-edited as "Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend?" which aired without any Ted Nugent content whatsoever. The complete "Full Bluntal Nugety (Director's Cut)" episode is available in its entirety, in the ''[[Undeclared]]'' DVD box set, including some extra Ted Nugent scenes that had been deleted.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

He made a guest appearance on the [[cult television]] series ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]'', in the episode "[[Gee Whiz (Aqua Teen Hunger Force episode)|Gee Whiz]]", on [[Adult Swim]]. Locals believe to have seen the face of Jesus in a billboard and they mention how it looks like Ted Nugent. Throughout the episode they think it's Jesus' face, but at the end they discover it was in fact Nugent's. He proceeds to shoot a flaming explosive arrow at Carl (mistaking him for a "varmint"). Ted also appeared in ''[[Seth MacFarlane's Cavalcade of Cartoon Comedy]]'' in a sketch where he kills the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] and serves him to guests for dinner.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

In 2007, Nugent debated ''[[The Simpsons]]'' producer [[Sam Simon]] on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' about the ethics of hunting animals. Coincidentally, Nugent would later lend his voice to an over-the-phone appearance in the [[The Simpsons (season 19)|season 19]] episode of ''The Simpsons'', "[[I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings]]", where, in a humorous jab at his political stance, inmate Dwight picks up his call for voting no to the fictional Proposition 87, which bans crossbows in public schools. As part of his pre-recorded message, Nugent asks "If we outlaw crossbows in our public schools, who's going to protect our children from charging elk?".<ref>{{Cite episode|title=I Don't Wanna Know Why the Caged Bird Sings|url=http://www.watchcartoononline.com/the-simpsons-season-19-episode-4-i-don%E2%80%99t-wanna-know-why-the-caged-bird-sings|access-date=May 24, 2011|series=[[The Simpsons]]|season=[[The Simpsons (season 19)|19]]|time=12:30|quote=If we outlaw crossbows in our public schools, who's going to protect our children from charging elk?}}</ref>

On July 9, 2010, Nugent was again interviewed by Jones and criticized the latest policies issued by the [[Obama administration]] and the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] concerning gun policy. He claimed that rejecting the idea of the right to self-defense being expressed in the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which Nugent called "gun control" policies, is most likely to destroy American society. Nugent also claimed similar policies were the cause of the downfall of every society in human history.<ref>{{YouTube|0lksDT8EoXE|"Ted Nugent: Obama is Waging War on The American Way of Life"}}, July 9, 2010</ref>

===Allegations of child sexual abuse===
Two women have accused Nugent of having sexual relationships with them when they were under 18 years old. In 1978, Nugent began a relationship with 17-year-old Hawaii native Pele Massa. The age of sexual consent in Hawaii at the time was 16;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deseret.com/2001/7/12/19595947/hawaii-lawmakers-raise-consent-age|title=Hawaii lawmakers raise consent age|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|date=July 12, 2001|website=Deseret News|access-date=August 20, 2019}}</ref> however, they could not marry due to the age difference.

===Family===
Nugent has been married twice and has six children with four women. In the late 1960s, prior to his first marriage, Nugent fathered a boy (Ted Mann) and a girl, both of whom he gave up for adoption in infancy. This did not become public knowledge until 2010. The siblings were adopted separately and had no contact with one another. The son learned the identity of his birth father in 2010, through the daughter's quest to make contact with him and their birth parents. According to a news report, over the years Nugent had discussed the existence of these children with his other children.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pearson|first1=Erica|title=Chip off the old 'Madman' block - Brooklyn restaurateur finds out he's the son of Ted Nugent|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/chip-old-madman-block-brooklyn-restaurateur-finds-son-ted-nugent-article-1.121195|newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|date=March 11, 2011}}</ref>

He was married to his first wife, Sandra Jezowski, from 1970 to 1979. They had two children, son Theodore Tobias "Toby" Nugent and daughter Sasha Nugent. Sandra died in a car crash in 1982.

His second marriage is to Shemane Deziel, whom he met while a guest on Detroit's WLLZ-FM, where she was a member of the news staff. They married on January 21, 1989. Together they have one child, son Rocco Winchester Nugent.

In 2005, Nugent agreed to pay $3,500 in monthly child support for a son fathered with Karen Gutowski while he was married to Deziel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ted-nugent-to-pay-child-support-to-new-hampshire-woman/|title=Ted Nugent To Pay Child Support To New Hampshire Woman|date=June 22, 2005|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=May 20, 2018}}</ref>

===Drug and alcohol stances===
Since the 1970s Nugent has promoted anti-drug and anti-alcohol stances. He has been cited as a key influence in the [[straight edge]] movement, a [[punk rock]]-associated lifestyle that developed in the early 1980s and discourages drug and alcohol use. [[Henry Rollins]], vocalist for [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], reports that he and friend [[Ian MacKaye]] (vocalist for [[Minor Threat]] and writer of the song "[[Straight Edge (song)|Straight Edge]]" that gave the movement its name) were inspired by Nugent during their high school years in the 1970s when he was the only major rock star to publicly eschew drug use: "[We] would read about the Nuge and the thing that really rubbed off on us was the fact that he didn't drink or smoke or do drugs ... [Nugent's performance] was the craziest thing we'd ever seen onstage and here's this guy saying, 'I don't get high.' We thought that was so impressive."<ref>As quoted by Michael Azerrad (2001) Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981–1991.

In May 2005, he announced he was "getting real close to deciding to run" for [[governor of Michigan]] in 2006; while in 2007, he talked about running for that office in 2010. During the latter period, he stated, "Michigan was once a great state. Michigan was a state that rewarded the entrepreneur and the most productive, work-ethic families of the state. Now the pimps and the whores and the welfare brats are basically the state's babies."<ref name="Tanner, Adam 2007" /> Earlier, Nugent had been rumored to be under consideration by the [[Illinois Republican Party]] as its candidate in that state's 2004 Senate race, given his roots in [[Illinois]].<ref name="auto1" />

In July 2008, Nugent declared "I was serious when I threatened to run for office in the past if I cannot find a candidate who respects the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]] and our sacred Bill of Rights."<ref name="Des"/> When asked by ''Imagineer'' magazine in a 2010 interview about what he would do if elected to political office, he responded: "Slash the living hell out of the waste and corruption and the outrageous army of do-nothing bureaucrats. I would fire every government worker whose job I would deem to be redundant and wasteful. No able-bodied human being would ever get a handout again."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ted Nugent on what he would if elected to public office|url=http://www.imagineermagazine.com/index.php/issue_archives/spring_2010/ted_nugent|website=Imagineer Magazine|access-date=October 1, 2011}}</ref>

In a July 2013 interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Nugent expressed interest in possibly running for President of the United States as a Republican in the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 election]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Hendrix|first=Steve|date=July 2, 2013|title=Ted, white and blue: How Ted Nugent has rocked politics|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/ted-nugent-guitarist-and-gun-lover-rocks-the-political-world/2013/07/02/7bb236dc-d203-11e2-9f1a-1a7cdee20287_print.html|newspaper=The Washington Post}}</ref> He never sought the office.
