'''Mr. Mister''' was an American [[rock music|rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] from [[Phoenix, Arizona]], active from 1982 until 1990. The band consisted of [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] on lead vocals and bass guitar, [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]] on keyboards/backing vocals, [[Pat Mastelotto]] on acoustic and electronic drums/percussion and Steve Farris on guitars/backing vocals. Mr. Mister was the successor to the band [[Pages (band)|Pages]], fronted by Page and George from 1978 to 1981.

==Early work==
Although formed in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States,<ref name=oldies>{{cite web|title=Mr. Mister Biography|url=http://www.oldies.com/artist-view/Mr-Mister.html|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=February 23, 2013}}</ref> Mr. Mister was based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=oldies/> [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] had previously worked as a [[session musician]] (for [[Quincy Jones]]) and had composed for [[Michael Jackson]], [[Rick Springfield]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Kenny Loggins]], [[Al Jarreau]], and many more.

In 1978, Page and his childhood friend [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Steve George]] founded the band [[Pages (band)|Pages]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. Pages explored a [[jazz fusion|pop fusion]] sound, with a changing lineup of session musicians. Although Pages had a minor hit single with "I Do Believe in You", and its three albums garnered favorable reviews, the group had little commercial success. After disbanding Pages in 1981, Page and George focused on songwriting and studio session work for pop artists ranging from [[Laura Branigan]] to [[Village People]].

By 1982, Page and George began putting together a more pop-oriented group with a permanent lineup, rounded out by drummer [[Pat Mastelotto]] and guitarist Steve Farris. All four members had done extensive session work for other artists and brought numerous influences to the band. The initial plan was to bring in a fifth member, a bass guitarist, but after realizing that Page, who was originally slated to be solely the lead singer, could also play bass, the members decided to remain a four-piece.<ref name= "History">{{cite web |author=Dehenau, Peter |url=http://users.skynet.be/sky67891/history.htm| title=History – Mr. Mister |website=Users.skynet.be |access-date=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

==Mainstream success==
When the first Mr. Mister album, ''[[I Wear the Face]]'', was released by [[RCA Records]] in 1984, Page was offered the chance to replace [[Bobby Kimball]] as lead singer of [[Toto (band)|Toto]], and later was offered [[Peter Cetera]]'s place in [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]; he refused both offers.<ref>{{cite web|author=Forchhammer, Georg |url=http://www.bluedesert.dk/pageinterview.html |title=Richard Page interview |date=December 1, 2008 |publisher=Blue Desert |access-date=March 30, 2009}}</ref>

Their second album, 1985's ''[[Welcome to the Real World (Mr. Mister album)|Welcome to the Real World]]''—with lyrics from Page's cousin John Lang—was the breakthrough for Mr. Mister. All three singles were in the top 10, two of which hit No.&nbsp;1 on the U.S. pop charts—"[[Kyrie (song)|Kyrie]]" and "[[Broken Wings (Mr. Mister song)|Broken Wings]]". The latter was inspired by the [[Broken Wings (Gibran novel)|book of the same title]] by [[Khalil Gibran]].<ref name="writing">{{Cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/sky67891/history.htm|title=History of Mr. Mister – Pages – 3rd Matinee – Richard Page|website=Users.skynet.be|access-date=November 7, 2019}}</ref> They had several No.&nbsp;1 [[MTV]] videos, and performed at the first ''MTV Spring Break'' show in 1986. That year, Mr. Mister had two [[Grammy Award]] nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Band]] (which was awarded to the "[[We Are the World]]" ensemble, [[USA for Africa]]).

During this time, Mr. Mister toured with other popular acts including [[Don Henley]], [[The Bangles]], [[Eurythmics]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], and [[Adam Ant]]. The band's third album was ''[[Go On...]]'', which was not a commercial success.

During the 1980s, the group wrote and/or performed songs for several movies, including the [[Stand and Deliver (Mr. Mister song)|title song]] for ''[[Stand and Deliver]]'', and "[[Is It Love (Mr. Mister song)|Is It Love]]" as the outro track for ''[[Stakeout (1987 film)|Stakeout]]''. "Don't Slow Down" appeared in ''[[A Fine Mess (film)|A Fine Mess]]''. The band also made concert appearances with the [[pop rock]] band [[the Bangles]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hochanadel |first1=Michael |date=July 26, 1986 |title=Mr. Mister, Bangles Deliver More Than Young SPAC Croud Expects |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SAwhAAAAIBAJ&pg=827%2C6626014 |work=[[Schenectady Gazette]] |access-date=February 8, 2017}}</ref>

Guitarist Steve Farris left in 1988.  The remaining band members teamed up with Christian recording artist [[Paul Clark (Christian musician)|Paul Clark]] and acted as his backup band for Clark's 1988 indie release ''Awakening from the Western Dream''. Next, the band began working on a fourth album, ''Pull'', with session guitarists [[Buzz Feiten]], [[Trevor Rabin]], Doug Macaskill and Peter McRea.  The album was completed in 1990, but RCA Records decided not to release it.  Soon afterwards, the band broke up.  The album remained unreleased for 20 years, although one track ("Waiting in My Dreams") appeared on a 2001 [[The Best of Mr. Mister (Mr. Mister album)|greatest hits]] collection by the band. On November 23, 2010, the remastered album was finally released by the band, in collaboration with [[Sony Music]], on Richard Page's independent label, Little Dume Recordings.

Long after their dissolution, the band was referenced in the song "[[Hey, Soul Sister]]" by [[Train (band)|Train]], with the line "Ain't that Mr. Mister on the radio, stereo?"
