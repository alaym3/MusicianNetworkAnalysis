'''Amerie Mi Marie Nicholson''' ({{nee}} '''Rogers'''; born January 12, 1980),<ref>{{cite news|first=Stevie|last=Chick|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/11/urban|title=Dancefloor dynamite|newspaper=The Guardian|date=2007-05-11|access-date=2011-11-24|location=London, UK}}</ref> is an American singer-songwriter, author and actress. Born and raised in Washington metropolitan area, Amerie gained an appreciation of the classical arts from her mother Mi Suk Rogers and of music from her father Charles Rogers, and she also studied dance from an early age and performed in talent contests. After her High School graduation, her family settled down in Virginia while she began to attend [[Georgetown University]], from which she later graduated with a degree in English and Fine Arts. While living in [[Washington, D.C.]], she met producer [[Rich Harrison]], who worked with such performers as [[Mary J. Blige]], and began developing demos with her. This led to a deal with Rise Entertainment and, in turn, major-label [[Columbia Records]].

==Early life==
Rogers was born to a Korean mother named Mi Suk and an [[African American]] father, Charles Rogers. A few months after she was born, the Rogers family moved to [[South Korea]], where Amerie lived for three years. Her father was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. military,<ref name="blender">[http://www.blender.com/guide/67984/miss-thing.html Miss Thing – Blender] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422190659/http://www.blender.com/guide/67984/miss-thing.html|date=April 22, 2009}}</ref> so the family lived in many different places, including Alaska, Texas, Virginia and Germany. She has a younger sister, Angela Rogers,<ref>Amerie/Angela Rogers At Sprite Street Couture Showcase [http://www.ohAmerie.com/gallery/images/sprite8.jpg 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924055300/http://www.ohamerie.com/gallery/images/sprite8.jpg|date=2015-09-24}}, [http://www.ohAmerie.com/gallery/images/sprite16.jpg 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517122431/http://www.ohamerie.com/gallery/images/sprite16.jpg|date=2014-05-17}}</ref> who is now her lawyer.

Amerie has described her parents as conservative, protective, traditional Christians. Growing up, she and her sister were forbidden to leave the house or use the phone on school days. The singer enrolled at [[Georgetown University]] to study literature, and was in [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps|Navy ROTC]]: "My dad didn't force me into it or anything. I joined so I could afford an education." She quit ROTC after her sophomore year and graduated with a B.A. in English and a Fine Arts minor in design.

While studying at Georgetown, Amerie befriended a Washington, D.C. club promoter who eventually put her in touch with producer [[Rich Harrison]]. During an interview with Maxim Magazine, Amerie said she agreed to meet up with Rich at a public location because she did not know Rich. McDonald's parking lot was chosen, where Rich played his tracks and Amerie sang along. Instantly they knew it was something special.

Harrison, who had just worked on Mary J. Blige's albums ''[[Mary (Mary J. Blige album)|Mary]]'' and ''[[No More Drama]]'', began recording and developing demos with Amerie. This led to her first record deal with Columbia Records. According to Amerie, she and Harrison immediately hit it off. In a 2002 Interview with Hip Online, she said: "For some reason we had a very special chemistry. When we would work together something great would happen."<ref>{{cite web|date=2002-11-18|title=Amerie Hip Online Interview:|url=http://www.hiponline.com/109/amerie-interview.html|publisher=Hip Online}}</ref>

She was featured on [[DJ Kayslay]]'s "Too Much for Me", on his 2003 album ''[[The Streetsweeper Vol. 1]]'', which peaked #53 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs.

===2004–2005: ''Touch''===
{{main|Touch (Amerie album)}}
Amerie gained even more recognition from her first acting role, in the 2004 film ''[[First Daughter (2004 film)|First Daughter]]'', starring with [[Katie Holmes]] and directed by [[Forest Whitaker]]. Also in 2004, she began working on her sophomore album, ''[[Touch (Amerie album)|Touch]]'', in early 2004. As with ''All I Have'', the album was co-written and produced by friend Rich Harrison, who contributed seven (new) tracks to the record; additional productions came from [[Lil Jon]], [[Bryce Wilson]], [[Red Spyda]], and [[Dre & Vidal]]. Unlike her first album, Amerie co-wrote every track but one, "Come with Me", which Harrison wrote. She assumed more creative control over the visual imagery accompanying the album, such as videos and artwork "I feel like when you do a record, you have a vision in your mind and you want to carry it across and it doesn't end with the studio", she has said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/amerie/news_feature_050509|title=Amerie: Hands-On Personal Touch|publisher=Mtv.com|date=2006-03-09|access-date=2011-11-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209024625/http://www.mtv.com/bands/a/amerie/news_feature_050509|archive-date=2012-02-09}}</ref>

In January 2005, Amerie released the lead single "[[1 Thing]]". The dance-pop song, which sampled [[The Meters|The Meters's]] 1970s funk recording "[[Oh! Calcutta!|Oh, Calcutta]]!", became Amerie's biggest hit to date. In the United States, it peaked #8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name="acharts">{{cite web|url=http://acharts.us/song/712|title=Amerie – 1 Thing – Music Charts|access-date=January 11, 2008|work=acharts.us}}</ref> and topped the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2005-05-07/r-b-hip-hop-songs "Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs"], Billboard Magazine; retrieved August 29, 2008.{{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131223110929/http://www.billboard.com/charts/2005-05-07/r-b-hip-hop-songs|date=December 23, 2013}}</ref>

The album's title track "[[Touch (Amerie song)|Touch]]" was released as the second single from the album and peaked at #95 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart in the United States, although it was a top 20 entry in the UK.

The success of "1 Thing" and ''Touch'' led to Amerie being nominated for several more awards. The album itself was nominated for two Grammy Award nominations in 2006: Best Female R&B Vocal Performance for "1 Thing", and [[Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album|Best Contemporary R&B Album]]. "1 Thing" also earned several awards and nominations: two nominations for the [[MTV Video Music Awards]]—[[MTV Video Music Award for Best Female Video|Best Female Video]] and [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography|Best Choreography]] and four nominations for the [[Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Lady of Soul Awards]] Best R&B/Soul Single, Solo, R&B/Soul or Rap Song of the Year, Best R&B/Soul or Rap Music Video, and Best R&B/Soul or Rap Dance Cut.

"1 Thing" also spawned into a variety of [[remix]]es by rappers such as [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], [[Fabolous]], and [[Jay-Z]]. In 2009, "1 Thing" was sixth on The Root's list of Top 10 Hip-Hop/R&B Songs of the 2000s.<ref>[http://www.theroot.com/multimedia/top-10-hip-hoprb-songs-00s Top 10 Hip-Hop/R&B Songs of the 2000s] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127182941/http://www.theroot.com/multimedia/top-10-hip-hoprb-songs-00s|date=2010-01-27}}</ref>

===2006–2007: ''Because I Love It''===
{{main|Because I Love It}}
In 2006, Amerie returned to the studio to work on her third album, ''[[Because I Love It]]'', enlisting producers such as [[Bryan-Michael Cox|The Buchanans]], One Up, Mike Caren. The album was her first not to feature writing and production from her long-time collaborator, friend, and producer Rich Harrison. She cited music of the 1980s as a major influence on the album, saying "I love 80s music period! That's why I did ''Because I Love It'', since it had mostly R&B, soul, and 80s new wave. When I said I wanted to do that in 2006, people were like, 'what?!' [...] but I love it."<ref>{{cite web|date=2009-08-03|title=Your Online Guide To Lifestyle|url=http://www.limitemagazine.com/2009/08/qa-amerie|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402032808/http://www.limitemagazine.com/2009/08/qa-amerie|archive-date=2012-04-02|access-date=2011-11-24|work=LimiteMagazine.com}}</ref>

"Take Control", which was co-produced by [[Mike Caren]], Amerie and Nicholson and co-written by Amerie along with [[Cee-Lo Green]], became a top 10 hit in the UK in mid 2007. ''Because I Love It'' was released on May 14, 2007, in Europe, Asia and Australasia, reaching the top 20 in the UK, where the album's second single, "[[Gotta Work]]", peaked #21.

First question: how come you have changed your name with an additional i? In fact, I thought I was following you on FB when I realized it wasn't your FB account (amerie instead of ameriie). Second question: when is your new album out (even approximatively), I think it's been 3 years since your last one ? Last question: any collaboration(s) planned for that album ?

In 2012, Amerie announced a forthcoming 'mini-LP' titled ''The Prelude''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2012/03/26/new-music-premiere-ameriie-every-time|title=New Music Premiere: Amerie – 'Every Time'|publisher=Rap-Up.com|date=2012-03-26|access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref> In 2013, she stated that she had been working on a new project, ''Because I Love It Vol. II'', a follow-up to her 2007 album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thatgrapejuice.net/2013/11/ameriie-plots-comeback-because-love-vol-2|title=Ameriie Plots Comeback With 'Because I Love It Vol. II'|publisher=Thatgrapejuice.net|date=2013-11-10|access-date=2014-08-11}}</ref> She said this album, ''BILI'', stemmed from songs that did not fit sonically or thematically onto ''Cymatika''&mdash;"songs that are heavy in percussion, but have a very aggressive, soulful element to them. They don't exist in any one time, or sound of the moment". ''BILI'' and ''Cymatika'' were both slated for release in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://attitude.co.uk/ameriie-interview-want-naked-horse/|title=Ameriie interview: 'I want to be naked on a horse!'|website=Attitude.co.uk|access-date=August 18, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818193631/http://attitude.co.uk/ameriie-interview-want-naked-horse/|archive-date=2017-08-18|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/and-another-thing-ameriie-interviewed|title=And Another Thing: Amerie Interviewed|website=Clashmusic.com|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref>

In an interview with Myplay.com, she described her early process of recording music: "I used to record songs that I wrote by using two different tape recorders and two separate tapes. I would start by recording myself on the first tape, singing the song down from top to finish. Then, I would play it back, while singing the harmonies and recording them on the second tape. I'd just keep repeating the process, going back and forth between tapes until I had a final version of the full song on one tape, with stacked harmonies, backgrounds and everything!".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myplay.com/artists/amerie/bio|title=Biodata|publisher=Myplay|access-date=2011-07-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723011605/http://www.myplay.com/artists/amerie/bio|archive-date=2011-07-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>
