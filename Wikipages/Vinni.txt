'''Øyvind Sauvik''' (born 3 February 1976), better known by his stage name '''Vinni''', is a Norwegian musician and hip hop artist.

==Biography==
Born in [[Arendal]], [[Norway]], Sauvik moved with his parents to [[Tanzania]] when he was three years old, as they worked with development agency NORAD. He grew up in Africa and learned to speak Swahili there.

Upon his return, he formed the hip hop duo [[Paperboys (group)|Paperboys]] with Jarle "J.J." Hollerud. When JJ left the formation, he was replaced by DJ Ole Alexander "Pope Dawg" Halstensgård. In the duo Øyvind Sauvik was popularly known as '''Vincent Vagabond''' or just '''Vinni'''. The band released a number of successful albums.

In 2009, Vinni took part in the Norwegian [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]] channel's reality television program ''Det store korslaget'', a competition of choirs. He took on a choir from [[Kolbotn]]<ref>[http://www.tv2.no/underholdning/korslaget2009/team-vinni-kjoeper-stemmer-2624496.html TV 2 Norway: Team Vinni "kjøper" stemmer] {{in lang|no}}</ref> where they finished 5th in the competition out of 7 choirs taking part.

In 2009, he also took part in ''Zebra Grand Prix'' a car racing competition of celebrities broadcast on [[TV2 Zebra]] where Vinni partnered with [[Vibeke Klemetsen]]. Although the couple passed the preliminary round of the race, they were eliminated after the semi-final race. The partners Trine Rein & Jan Erik Larssen were the eventual winners.
