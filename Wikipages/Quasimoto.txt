'''Quasimoto''' is a [[side project]] of [[Hip hop production|hip hop producer]] [[Madlib]], from [[Oxnard, California]].  Quasimoto is composed of Madlib and his animated [[alter ego]] Lord Quas. Lord Quas is known for his high pitched voice, which often interacts with Madlib's regular voice. Quasimoto was conceived one day in the studio, when Madlib decided to rap to his own beats. Madlib did not like the sound of his voice<ref>{{cite web|author=Hua Hsu|url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2021/01/25/the-obsessive-beat-making-of-madlib|title=The Obsessive Beat-Making of Madlib|website=[[The New Yorker]]|date=25 January 2021|access-date=25 January 2021}}</ref> (his friends in Oxnard call him 'Barry White' in reference to his deep voice) so he decided to slow his recorder down, rap slowly, then speed the recording back up to produce Lord Quas' distinctive high pitched sound. Quasimoto's lyrics frequently address themes such as violence and drug use in a comedic fashion, and the character of Lord Quas has frequently been interpreted as a satirical take on [[gangsta-rap]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Macia |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6613-the-unseen/ |title=Quasimoto: The Unseen Album Review |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=31 August 2005 |access-date=15 March 2020}}</ref>

==History==
[[Peanut Butter Wolf]], DJ and owner of [[Stones Throw Records]], heard Quas' demo tapes and encouraged Madlib to release more tracks under this alias. Quasimoto was featured on Wolf's ''[[My Vinyl Weighs a Ton]]'' album in 1998, on the song "Styles Crews Flows Beats." Later, Madlib put out Quasimoto's debut album - ''[[The Unseen (album)|The Unseen]]'' - in 2000. This album received much praise from [[underground music|underground]] fans and from mainstream media, making it onto [[Spin Magazine]]'s top albums of the year list.

After the release of ''The Unseen'', Madlib spent the next few years working on different projects such as [[Yesterdays New Quintet]] and his album ''[[Shades of Blue (Madlib album)|Shades of Blue]]''. Quas re-emerged in 2003, making a few guest appearances, notably on [[Jaylib]]'s ''[[Champion Sound]]'' and  [[Madvillain]]'s ''[[Madvillainy]]'' (Madlib and [[Daniel Dumile|MF DOOM]]). Quasimoto officially returned with the vinyl-only ''Bus Ride'' [[extended play|EP]] in 2005, continuing his distinctive style of high pitched rhymes and unorthodox samples.

In 2005, Quasimoto dropped ''[[The Further Adventures of Lord Quas]]'' which featured [[M.E.D. (rapper)|M.E.D.]] and MF DOOM. The album cover features a reference to [[Frank Zappa]]'s debut album, ''[[Freak Out!]]'', a picture of super-producer [[J Dilla]], and a picture of [[Wild Man Fischer]], who is also referenced in one of the songs. The voice of [[Melvin Van Peebles]] is sampled on several tracks from both albums.

Quasimoto released their third studio album entitled ''[[Yessir Whatever]]''  in June 2013, which is a compilation of several previously unreleased works. It collects 12-tracks made by Madlib and Quas over a roughly 12-year period. A few were released on rare and out-of-print vinyl, while a few others are previously unreleased, now mixed and mastered for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2013/04/quasimoto-yessir-whatever |title=Quasimoto - Yessir Whatever &#124; Stones Throw Records |website=[[Stones Throw Records|Stones Throw]] |date=18 June 2013 |access-date=28 October 2016}}</ref>

==Influences==
In an interview, Madlib said that the atmosphere and sound on the Quasimoto albums owe much to the work of [[Alain Goraguer]] on the soundtrack of ''[[La Planete Sauvage]]''.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} An early Quasimoto video features excerpts from the film, and the song "Come On Feet" contains a sample from its soundtrack.
