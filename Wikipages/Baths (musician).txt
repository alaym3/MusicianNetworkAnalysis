==History==
Will Wiesenfeld is a classically trained musician, and began learning the piano at the age of four "to compete with his brother".<ref name="Postfoetus">{{cite web| url= http://www.post-foetus.com/| title= [post foetus]| accessdate= 5 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110129010410/http://www.post-foetus.com/| archivedate= 2011-01-29| url-status= dead}}</ref> By twelve he had "completely abandoned it," but continual musical experimenting led him to record his first piece of music at age fourteen. He released a few projects, including an album entitled The Fabric, as his previous moniker, [Post-foetus]. He also ventured into a more [[ambient music|ambient]] style with side-project Geotic, which Irish magazine [[State (magazine)|State.ie]] called "gorgeous".<ref name="State">{{cite web |url=http://www.state.ie/album-reviews/22794-baths-cerulean |title=Baths - Cerulean - Review |work=[[State (magazine)|State.ie]] |first=Adam |last=Lacey |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=5 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104095405/http://www.state.ie/album-reviews/22794-baths-cerulean |archivedate=4 January 2011 }}</ref>

Will Wiesenfeld derives his current alias from his childhood memory of taking in art and music by dwelling on it in his bathtub, which he claims he was very fond of. Baths released the debut album ''[[Cerulean (album)|Cerulean]]'' under [[Anticon]] in 2010.<ref name="DIS">{{cite web|url=http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15559/reviews/4140612 |title=Baths - Cerulean |work=[[Drowned in Sound]] |first=Kyle|last=Ellison |date=30 July 2010|accessdate=5 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101123103738/http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15559/reviews/4140612| archivedate= 23 November 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> He recorded the entire album in two months from his bedroom.<ref name="g934" /> It was listed by [[The A.V.

The [[BBC]]'s Mike Diver claims Baths' nearest musical soundalike is [[chillwave]] musician [[Toro y Moi]].<ref name=BBC>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/6mcg|publisher=[[BBC]]|title=Reviews: Baths - Cerulean |date=3 August 2010|accessdate=5 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110213065628/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/6mcg| archivedate= 13 February 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' noted Baths' use of "unorthodox" sounds layered in and around the electronics, in particular "clicking pens, vocal samples, rustling blankets and scissor snaps".<ref name="DIS" /> British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s [[Paul Lester]] commented he was reminded of "[[J Dilla]] playing around with the [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] and [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] catalogues" while listening to ''[[Cerulean (album)|Cerulean]]''.<ref name="g934" /><ref name="TMT">{{cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/baths-cerulean |title=Baths - Cerulean |publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] |first=B|last=McGhee |year=2010 |accessdate=5 January 2011}}</ref>

In a 2017 interview with Ethan Gach from ''[[Kotaku]]'', Baths noted that he drew some inspiration from [[anime]] and [[video game]]s such as ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]'' and ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]''.<ref name="Kotaku">{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/the-electronic-musician-inspired-by-anime-and-dragon-ag-1820683451|title=The Electronic Musician Inspired By Anime And Dragon Age|website=[[Kotaku]]|first=Ethan|last=Liedel|date=November 22, 2017}}</ref>
