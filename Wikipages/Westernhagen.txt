The '''von Westernhagen''' are a German noble family.

The Westernhagens are members of an old [[Thuringia]]n nobility and originated in [[Lower Saxony]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schlossarchiv.de/herren/w/WE/Westernhagen.htm|title=von Westernhagen|website=schlossarchiv.de}}</ref> The first reference to the family was made in 1258. The original family name was '''von Hagen'''. The family acquired a fiefdom in 1283 and built Westernhagen Castle in [[Berlingerode]], from which their name derives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.von-westernhagen.com/familiengeschichte.html|title=Westernhagen|website=www.von-westernhagen.com}}</ref>

==History==
The family is first mentioned in 1258 with ''Conradus and Hermannus Indagine'' (Latin for ''Hagen'' meaning ''hague'', an area fortified and fenced with a hedge). With the latter Hermannus, an uninterrupted ancestry line begins. The name changed from de Indagine, Hayn, Hagen to Westernhagen.

Already in 1123 (however first mentioned in documents in 1288) the lords of [[Berlingerode]] in the [[Eichsfeld (district)|Eichsfeld district]] built the old moated Castle Hagen (Westernhagen Castle) near Berlingerode. Around 1300 some relatives, probably tribally related to the lords of Berlingerode, built Castle Osternhagen (Eastern Hagen) at [[Hundeshagen]]. Some later members of this family named themselves after the old moated castle of Western Hagen, when they had moved there. Westernhagen Castle was destroyed in 1525 during the [[German Peasants' War]]. The main seat of the family, among other properties, became nearby [[Teistungen]], which they had owned since 1283 and where they had built two [[tower house]]s that were later replaced by manor houses.

The family converted from Catholicism to Protestantism after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in the sixteenth century. Members of the family served in the Prussian military under [[Frederick the Great]]. In the twentieth century, most of the family properties were seized by the Communist government of [[East Germany]]. After the [[German reunification]], the Oberhof manor and estate in [[Teistungen]] was re-purchased by Burghard von Westernhagen, the father of [[Thyra von Westernhagen|Princess Heinrich of Hanover]].
