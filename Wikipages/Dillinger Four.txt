==History==
The group was formed 1994 by guitarist Erik Funk and bassist Patrick Costello. The pair originally played together in a short lived but much beloved hardcore band from Chicago called Angerhouse. Angerhouse broke up after Funk moved to Minneapolis for college. When Costello later followed, Dillinger Four was born. 

The original lineup, which also included guitarist Sloan Lorsung and drummer Lane Pedersen, released the 1995 debut 7" single ''Higher Aspirations: Tempered and Dismantled''. Lorsung was replaced by Bill Morrisette before the 1996 follow-up EP ''The Kids Are All Dead''. A series of subsequent singles and compilation appearances were later collected on 1999's ''This Shit is Genius''. 

In the mid-'90s, the band was signed to California hardcore label [[Hopeless Records]] on the strength of what Hopeless founder Louis Posen called its "international following."<ref name=KerrangHopeless>{{cite news |last= Richardson |first=Jake |title=11 Things Hopeless Records Has Taught Us Over the Past 25 Years |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/11-things-hopeless-records-has-taught-us-over-the-past-25-years/ |work=[[Kerrang!]] |location=[[London]] |access-date=2020-07-25 }}</ref> The label released Dillinger Four's first two full-length records, 1998's ''Midwestern Songs of the Americas'' and 2000's ''Versus God''. The band moved to Fat Wreck Chords for 2002's ''Situationist Comedy'' and 2008's ''Civil War''.<ref name=AllmusicD4>{{AllMusic |id=dillinger-four-mn0000258567 |title=Dillinger Four |last=Ankeny |first=Jason |access-date=2020-07-25 }}</ref>

Funk founded and co-owned the influential Minneapolis music venue [[Triple Rock Social Club]], which opened in 1998 and closed in 2017. Dillinger Four played the venue's final concert in November 2017.<ref name=CityPages2017>{{cite news |last= Lunney |first= Tigger |date=2017-11-22 |url= http://www.citypages.com/music/the-triple-rock-ends-its-19-year-run-with-dillinger-four-and-negative-approach/459351723 |title= The Triple Rock ends its 19-year run with Dillinger Four and Negative Approach |work=[[City Pages]] |location=[[Minneapolis]] |access-date=2020-07-25 }}</ref>
