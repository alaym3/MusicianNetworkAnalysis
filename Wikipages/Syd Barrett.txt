'''Roger Keith''' "'''Syd'''" '''Barrett''' (6 January 1946&nbsp;– 7 July 2006) was an English singer, songwriter, and musician who co-founded the rock band [[Pink Floyd]] in 1965. Barrett was their original frontman and primary songwriter, becoming known for his whimsical take on [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]],<ref name="ucr"/> English-accented singing, literary influences, and stream-of-consciousness writing style.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|pp=144–148, 381–382}} As a guitarist, he was influential for his [[form (music)|free-form]] playing and for employing [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]], [[Distortion (music)|distortion]], [[echo machine|echo]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], and other [[studio effect]]s.

Originally trained as a painter, Barrett was musically active for fewer than ten years. With Pink Floyd, he recorded four singles, their debut album ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'' (1967), portions of their second album ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'' (1968), and several unreleased songs. In April 1968, Barrett was ousted from the band amid speculation of [[Mental disorder|mental illness]] and his excessive use of [[psychedelic drug]]s. He began a brief solo career in 1969 with the single "[[Octopus (Syd Barrett song)|Octopus]]" and followed with the albums ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'' (1970) and ''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]'' (1970), recorded with the aid of several members of Pink Floyd.<ref name="bio">{{cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stephen |title=Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=11 October 2010 |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/syd-barrett-mn0000044874|access-date=1 August 2012}}</ref>

In 1972, Barrett left the music industry, retired from public life and strictly guarded his privacy until his death. He continued painting and dedicated himself to gardening. Pink Floyd recorded several tributes and homages to him, including the 1975 song [[suite (music)|suite]] "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" and the 1979 [[rock opera]] ''[[The Wall]]''. In 1988, [[EMI]] released an album of unreleased tracks and outtakes, ''[[Opel (album)|Opel]]'', with Barrett's approval. He died of [[pancreatic cancer]] in 2006.

==Life and career==
=== Early years ===
Barrett was born 6 January 1946<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/06/UPI-Almanac-for-Sunday-Jan-6-2019/8591546568650/ |title= UPI Almanac for Sunday, Jan. 6, 2019|work=[[United Press International]]|date=6 January 2019|access-date=10 September 2019|archive-date=September 11, 2019 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20190911222236/https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2019/01/06/UPI-Almanac-for-Sunday-Jan-6-2019/8591546568650/|url-status=live|quote= Rock and Roll Hall of Fame member Syd Barrett (Pink Floyd) in 1946}}</ref> as Roger Keith Barrett in [[Cambridge, Cambridgeshire]] to a middle-class family living at 60 Glisson Road.<ref name="manning3">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=8}}</ref><ref name="Irghd3-4">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|pp=3–4}}</ref> Barrett was the fourth of five children.{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} His father, [[Max Barrett|Arthur Max Barrett]], was a prominent [[pathologist]]<ref name="manning3" /><ref name="blake13">{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=13}}</ref><ref name="Irghd4">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=4}}</ref> and was related to [[Elizabeth Garrett Anderson]] through Max's maternal grandmother Ellen Garrett, who was Elizabeth's cousin.<ref name="blake13"/><ref name="Irghd4"/> In 1951, his family moved to 183 [[Hills Road, Cambridge|Hills Road]].<ref name="manning3"/><ref name="Irghd3-4"/>

Barrett played piano occasionally but usually preferred writing and drawing. He bought a [[ukulele]] aged 10, a banjo at 11{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp= 9–10}} and a Hofner [[acoustic guitar]] at 14.<ref name="pal001"/>{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}} A year after he purchased his first acoustic guitar, he bought his first electric guitar and built his own [[amplifier]]. One story of how Barrett acquired the nickname "Syd" is that at the age of 14 he was named after an old local Cambridge [[jazz]] double bassist,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}}{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=12}} Sid "The Beat" Barrett, which claims Syd Barrett changed the spelling to differentiate himself from his namesake.{{sfn|Mason|2011}}

Another account is that when he was 13, his schoolmates nicknamed him "Syd" after he showed up to a field day at Abington Scout site wearing a [[flat cap]] instead of his [[Scout (Scouting)|Scout]] beret because "Syd" was a "working-class" name.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=11–12}} He used both names interchangeably for several years. His sister Rosemary said: "He was never Syd at home. He would never have allowed it."{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=12}} He was a Scout with the 7th Cambridge troop and went on to be a patrol leader.{{sfn|Palacios|2010}}

At one point at Morley Memorial Junior School he was taught by the mother of future Pink Floyd bassist [[Roger Waters]].{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=8}} Later, in 1957, he attended [[Cambridgeshire High School for Boys]]{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=9}} with Waters.<ref name="manning3" /> His father died of cancer on 11 December 1961,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}}{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=17}} less than a month before Barrett's 16th birthday.{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=31}} On this date, Barrett left the entry in his diary blank.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}} By this time, his brothers and sisters had left home and his mother decided to rent out rooms to lodgers.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=17}}{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=33}}<ref name="cambridge-news.co.uk">{{cite news |title=Seeing Pink – a Floyd gazetteer of Cambridge|date=17 October 2007|newspaper=Cambridge Evening News|url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Features/Seeing-Pink-a-Floyd-gazetteer-of-Cambridge.htm|access-date=17 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111223110005/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Home/Features/Seeing-Pink-a-Floyd-gazetteer-of-Cambridge.htm|archive-date=23 December 2011}}</ref>

Eager to help her son recover from his grief, Barrett's mother encouraged the band in which he played, Geoff Mott and the Mottoes, a band which Barrett formed,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}} to perform in their front room. Waters and Barrett were childhood friends, and Waters often visited such gigs.<ref name="manning3"/>{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}}{{sfn|Schaffner|2005|p=22-23}} At one point, Waters organised a gig, a [[CND]] benefit at [[Friends Meeting House]] on 11 March 1962,<ref name="manning3" /> but shortly afterwards Geoff Mott joined the Boston Crabs, and the Mottoes broke up.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=10}}

In September 1962, Barrett had taken a place at the art department of the [[Anglia Ruskin University|Cambridgeshire College of Arts and Technology]],<ref name="Irghd40">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=40}}</ref> where he met [[David Gilmour]].<ref name="manning5">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=11}}</ref> In late 1962 and early 1963, [[the Beatles]] made an impact on Barrett, and he began to play Beatles songs at parties and at picnics. In 1963, Barrett became a [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]] fan and, with then-girlfriend Libby Gausden, saw them perform at a village hall in Cambridgeshire.<ref name="manning5"/>

At this point, Barrett started writing songs; one friend recalls hearing "Effervescing Elephant" (later to be recorded on his solo album ''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]'').{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=11–12}} Also around this time, Barrett and Gilmour occasionally played acoustic gigs together.<ref name="manning6">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=12}}</ref> Barrett had played bass guitar with Those Without in mid-1963<ref name="manning6" /><ref name="Irgh50">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=50}}</ref> and bass and guitar with the Hollerin' Blues the next summer.<ref name="manning6"/> In 1964, Barrett and Gausden saw [[Bob Dylan]] perform.<ref name="manning5"/> After this performance, Barrett was inspired to write "[[Bob Dylan Blues]]".<ref name="Irgh58">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=58}}</ref> Barrett, now thinking about his future,<ref name="manning6" /> decided to apply for [[Camberwell College of Arts]] in London.<ref name="Irghd45">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=45}}</ref> Barrett enrolled in the college in the summer of 1964<ref name="manning6"/> to study painting.<ref name="Times obit">{{cite news|title=Syd Barretxt obit|last=Staff|date=12 July 2006|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article686038.20ece|access-date=11 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Pink Floyd years (1965–1968) ===
{{Main|Pink Floyd#1963–1967: Early years}}
Starting in 1964, the band that would become Pink Floyd evolved through various line-up and name changes including "The Abdabs",{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=14}}<ref name="Irgh52">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=52}}</ref> "The Screaming Abdabs",<ref name="Irgh52" /> "Sigma 6",<ref name="Irgh52" />{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=38}} and "The Meggadeaths".<ref name="Irgh52" /> In 1965, Barrett joined them as the Tea Set<ref name="Irgh52" /><ref name="manning9">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=15}}</ref> (sometimes spelled T-Set).<ref name="blake43">{{harvnb|Blake|2008|p=43}}</ref> When they found themselves playing a concert with another band of the same name, Barrett came up with "The Pink Floyd Sound" (also known as "The Pink Floyd Blues Band",<ref name="blake43" /> later "The Pink Floyd").{{refn|Barrett devised the name "Pink Floyd" by juxtaposing the first names of [[Pink Anderson]] and [[Floyd Council]]<ref name=Irgh53>{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=53}}</ref> whom he had read about in a sleeve note for a 1962 [[Blind Boy Fuller]] album: "Curley Weaver and Fred McMullen, [...] Pink Anderson or Floyd Council—these were a few amongst the many blues singers who were to be heard in the rolling hills of the Piedmont, or meandering with the streams through the wooded valleys."<ref>{{cite web |title=Floyd Council |url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/council.html |access-date=23 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HcAvBeWD?url=http://toto.lib.unca.edu/sounds/piedmontblues/council.html |archive-date=24 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=manning10>Manning 2006, p. 19</ref>|group="nb"|}} During 1965, they went into a studio for the first time, when a friend of [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]]'s gave the band free time to record.{{refn|They recorded a cover of [[Slim Harpo]]'s "[[I'm a King Bee]]", and three Barrett originals: "Double O Bo", "Butterfly" and "Lucy Leave".<ref>{{harvnb|Manning|2006|pp= 15–16}}</ref><ref name=Irgh65>{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=65}}</ref> "Double O Bo" and "Lucy Leave" survive as vinyl [[acetates]].<ref name=Irgh65/><ref name=manning8>{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=16}}</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name="manning9" />

During this summer Barrett had his first [[lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] trip in the garden of friend Dave Gale,<ref name="manning7">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=17}}</ref><ref name="Irgh76-77">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|pp=76–77}}</ref> with Ian Moore and [[Storm Thorgerson]].{{refn|While under the influence of the acid, Barrett had placed an orange, a plum and a matchbox in a corner, and then stared at this arrangement, which he claimed symbolised "Venus and Jupiter".<ref name=manning7 /><ref name=Irgh76-77/> Thorgerson later added these items to the cover of the double album combination of Barrett's solo albums, ''[[Syd Barrett (album)|Syd Barrett]]''.<ref name=manning7 />|group="nb"}}<ref name="manning7" /> During one trip, Barrett and another friend, Paul Charrier, ended up naked in the bath, reciting: "No rules, no rules".<ref name="manning11">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=18}}</ref> That summer, as a result of the continued drug use, the band became absorbed in [[Contemporary Sant Mat movements|Sant Mat]], a [[Sikh]] sect. Storm Thorgerson (then living on [[Earlham Street]]) and Barrett went to a London hotel to meet the sect's [[guru]]; Thorgerson managed to join the sect; Barrett, however, was deemed too young to join. Thorgerson sees this as a deeply important event in Barrett's life, as he was extremely upset by the rejection. While living near his friends, Barrett decided to write more songs ("[[Bike (song)|Bike]]" was written around this time).<ref name="manning10" />

{{Main|Blackhill Enterprises}}

While Pink Floyd began by playing cover versions of American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs,<ref name="Irgh73">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=73}}</ref> by 1966 they had carved out their own style of improvised rock and roll,{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=45}}<ref name="Irgh99">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=99}}</ref> which drew as much from improvised [[jazz]].<ref name="Irgh124">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=124}}</ref> After [[Bob Klose]] departed from the band, the band's direction changed.  However, the change was not instantaneous,{{refn|The band were still playing R&B hits as late as early 1966,<ref name=Irgh86>{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=86}}</ref><ref name=Irgh104>{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=104}}</ref> however, mixed in with several original songs: "Let's Roll Another One", "Lucy Leave", "Butterfly", "Remember Me" and "Walk with Me Sydney".<ref name=Irgh86/>|group="nb"}} with more improvising on the guitars and keyboards.<ref name="manning10" /> Drummer [[Nick Mason]] reflected, "It always felt to me that most of the ideas were emanating from Syd at the time."{{refn|Barrett, frequently at his Earlham Street residence, played [[The Mothers of Invention]]'s ''[[Freak Out!]]'', [[The Byrds]]' ''[[Fifth Dimension (album)|Fifth Dimension]]'', [[The Fugs]]' and [[Love (band)|Love]]'s debut albums,<ref name=manning14>{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=26}}</ref> and [[The Beatles]]' ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'',<ref name=Irgh132>{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=132}}</ref> repeatedly. All these albums were connected by their proto-psychedelic feel, which had begun to guide Barrett's songs, as much as R&B had, previously.<ref name=manning14 /> "[[Interstellar Overdrive]]" (included into the band's setlist from autumn), for example, was inspired by the [[riff]] from Love's "[[My Little Red Book]]", the [[free form jazz|free-form]] section (and also, "[[Pow R. Toc H.]]") was inspired by [[Frank Zappa]]'s free-form freak-outs and The Byrds' "[[Eight Miles High]]". The Kinks' "[[Sunny Afternoon]]" was an important influence on Barrett's songwriting.<ref name=manning14 />|group="nb"}}<ref name="manning10" />

At this time, Barrett's reading reputedly included [[Brothers Grimm|Grimm]]'s ''[[Grimms' Fairy Tales|Fairy Tales]]'', [[Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[Lord of the Rings]]'', and ''[[Iching|The I-Ching]]''. During this period, Barrett wrote most of the songs for Pink Floyd's [[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn|first album]], and also songs that would later appear on his solo albums.<ref name="manning14" /> In 1966, a new rock concert venue, the [[UFO Club|UFO]] (pronounced as "you-foe"),<ref name="manning19">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=30}}</ref> opened in London and quickly became a haven for British [[psychedelic music]]. Pink Floyd, the house band,<ref name="Irgh86" /><ref name="manning19" /><ref>{{cite web |author=<!--none give--> |title=20th Century London: Youth Culture & Fashion |url=http://www.20thcenturylondon.org.uk/server.php?show=nav.36 |access-date=11 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="MCLM27">{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=27}}</ref> was its most popular attraction and after making appearances at the rival [[The Roundhouse|Roundhouse]],<ref name="MCLM27" /><ref name="manning13">Manning 2006, p. 27</ref><ref name="Irgh115">Chapman 2010, p. 115</ref> became the most popular musical group of the "[[UK underground|London Underground]]" psychedelic music scene.<ref name="pal001">{{harvnb|Palacios|1997}}</ref>

By the end of 1966, Pink Floyd had gained a reliable management team in [[Andrew King (music manager)|Andrew King]] and [[Peter Jenner]].<ref name="manning16">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=25}}</ref> Towards the end of October 1966, Pink Floyd, with King and Jenner, set up [[Blackhill Enterprises]], to manage the group's finances. Blackhill was staffed by lodgers Jenner found in his Edbrooke Road house, and among others, Barrett's flatmate, Peter Wynne Wilson (who became road manager, however, since he had more experience in lighting, he was also lighting assistant).<ref name="manning15">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=28}}</ref> King and Jenner wanted to prepare some demo recordings for a possible record deal, so at the end of October, they booked a session at Thompson Private Recording Studio,<ref name="MCLM27" /> in [[Hemel Hempstead]].{{refn|The demo recordings consist of "I Get Stoned" (aka "Stoned Alone"), "Let's Roll Another One", "Lucy Leave" and a 15-minute version of "Interstellar Overdrive".<ref name=manning15 />|group="nb"}}<ref name="manning15" /> King said of the demos: "That was the first time I realised they were going to write all their own material, Syd just turned into a songwriter, it seemed like overnight."{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=28–29}}

King and Jenner befriended American expatriate [[Joe Boyd]], the promoter of the [[UFO Club]], who was making a name for himself as one of the more important entrepreneurs on the British music scene. The newly hired booking agent, [[Bryan Morrison]], and Boyd had proposed sending in better quality recordings. From Morrison's agency the band played a gig outside London for the first time.<ref name="manning17">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=29}}</ref> In November, the band performed the first (of many) strangely named concerts: Philadelic Music for Simian Hominids, a multimedia event arranged by the group's former landlord, Mike Leonard, at Hornsey College of Art.<ref name="MCLM27" /><ref name="manning17" /> They performed at the Free School<ref name="Irgh95">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=95}}</ref> for the following two weeks, before performing at the Psychodelphia Versus [[Ian Smith]] event at the Roundhouse in December, arranged by the Majority Rule for Rhodesia Campaign, and an [[Oxfam]] benefit at the [[Albert Hall]]<ref name="MCLM27" /> (the band's biggest venue up to this point).<ref name="manning17" />

==== ''Tonite Lets All Make Love in London'' ====
{{Main|Tonite Lets All Make Love in London}}

At the beginning of 1967, Barrett was dating Jenny Spires (who would later marry future [[Stars (British band)|Stars]] member Jack Monck). However, unknown to Barrett, Spires had an affair with [[Peter Whitehead (filmmaker)|Peter Whitehead]]. Spires convinced Whitehead (who thought the band sounded like "bad [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]]") to use Pink Floyd in a film about the [[swinging London]] scene.<ref name="manning18">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=31}}</ref> So at the cost of £80 ({{Inflation|UK|80|1967|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}{{Inflation-fn|UK|df=y}}), in January, Whitehead took the band into [[John Wood (music producer)|John Wood]]'s Sound Techniques in Chelsea,<ref name="Irgh123">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=123}}</ref> with promoter Joe Boyd in tow.<ref name="manning18" /> Here, the band recorded a 16-minute version of "Interstellar Overdrive" and another composition, "Nick's Boogie".<ref name="manning18" /><ref name="Irgh123" /> Whitehead had filmed this recording, which was used in the film ''Tonite Lets All Make Love in London''<ref name="Irgh123" /> and later on the video release of ''[[London '66–'67]]''.<ref name="manning18" /><ref name="Irgh123" /> Whitehead later commented about the band that: "They were just completely welded together, just like a jazz group".<ref name="manning18" />

==== ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'' ====
{{Main|The Piper at the Gates of Dawn}}

Boyd attempted to sign the band with [[Polydor Records]].<ref name="Irgh132" /><ref name="toby31-32">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|pp=31–32}}</ref> However, Morrison had convinced King and Jenner to try to start a bidding war between Polydor and [[EMI]].<ref name="toby31-32" /> In late January, Boyd produced a recording session for the group,<ref name="Irgh132" /><ref name="manning16" /> with them returning to Sound Techniques in Chelsea again.{{refn|The Sound Techniques session resulted in a recording of the single "[[Arnold Layne]]",<ref name=Irgh132/><ref name=manning17 /> and the recording of other songs: "[[Matilda Mother]]", "[[Chapter 24]]", "Interstellar Overdrive" and "Let's Roll Another One" (which was renamed to "[[Candy and a Currant Bun]]", at the suggestion of Waters). Referring to the choice of "Arnold Layne", [[Nick Mason]] said: "We knew we wanted to be rock'n'roll stars and we wanted to make singles, so it seemed the most suitable song to condense into 3 minutes without losing too much".<ref name="manning20">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=32}}</ref>|group="nb"}}<ref name="Irgh132" /><ref name="MCLM28">{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=28}}</ref> After the bidding war idea was finished, Pink Floyd signed with EMI. Unusual for the time, the deal included recording an album, which meant the band had unlimited studio time at [[EMI Studios]] in return for a smaller royalty percentage. The band then attempted to re-record "Arnold Layne", but the Boyd version from January was released instead.<ref name="manning20" />

The band's first studio album, ''[[The Piper at the Gates of Dawn]]'', was recorded intermittently between February and July 1967 in Studio 3 at [[Abbey Road Studios]], and produced by former [[The Beatles|Beatles]] engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]].{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=34}} By the time the album was released on 4 August, "Arnold Layne" (which was released months earlier, on 11 March) had reached number 20 on the British singles charts,<ref name="officialcharts1">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/pink%20floyd/ |title=PINK FLOYD &#124; Artist |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=7 July 2012}}</ref> despite being banned by Radio London,<ref name="manning20" /><ref name="Irgh141-142">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|pp=141–142}}</ref> and the follow-up single, "[[See Emily Play]]", had peaked at number 6.<ref name="officialcharts1" /> The album was successful in the UK, hitting number 6 on the British album charts.<ref name="officialcharts1" /> Their first three singles (including their third, "[[Apples and Oranges (song)|Apples and Oranges]]"), were written by Barrett, who also was the principal visionary/author of their critically acclaimed 1967 debut album. Of the eleven songs on ''Piper'', Barrett wrote eight and co-wrote another two.<ref>EMI Records Ltd., "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn" insert</ref>

=== Health problems ===

Through late 1967 and early 1968, Barrett became increasingly erratic, partly as a consequence of his reported heavy use of psychedelic drugs such as [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref name="pal001" /> There is also speculation that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]]. Once described as joyful, friendly, and extroverted, he became increasingly depressed and withdrawn, and experienced hallucinations, disorganised speech, memory lapses, intense mood swings, and periods of [[catatonia]].{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} Although the changes began gradually, he went missing for a long weekend and, according to several friends, including Wright, came back "a completely different person".{{sfn|Palacios|2010}}

One of the striking features of his change was the development of a blank, dead-eyed stare. Barrett did not recognise friends, and often did not know where he was; on a tour of Los Angeles, Barrett is said to have exclaimed, "Gee, it sure is nice to be in Las Vegas!"{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} Many reports described him on stage, strumming one chord through the entire concert, or not playing at all.<ref name="Econ">{{cite news |author=<!--none given--> |title=Syd Barrett |work=The Economist |date=20 July 2006 |url=http://www.economist.com/obituary/displaystory.cfm?story_id=7188674 |access-date=18 June 2007}}</ref> At a show in [[Santa Monica]], Barrett slowly detuned his guitar.{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=95}}

Interviewed on [[Pat Boone]]'s show during the tour, Barrett replied with a "blank and totally mute stare"; according to Mason, "Syd wasn't into moving his lips that day." Barrett exhibited similar behaviour during the band's first appearance on [[Dick Clark]]'s television show ''[[American Bandstand]]''.{{sfn|Schaffner|2005|p=13}} Surviving footage of this appearance shows Barrett miming his parts competently;{{sfn|Chapman|2010|p=199}} however, during a group interview afterwards, Barrett gave terse answers. During this time, Barrett would often forget to bring his guitar to sessions, damage equipment and was occasionally unable to hold his plectrum.{{sfn|Willis|2002a|p=102}} Before a performance in late 1967, Barrett reportedly crushed [[Methaqualone|Mandrax]] tranquilliser tablets and a tube of [[Brylcreem]] into his hair, which melted down his face under the heat of the stage lighting,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=42}} making him look like "a guttered candle".<ref name="Schaffner13-14">{{harvnb|Schaffner|2005|pp==13–14}}</ref> Mason disputed the Mandrax portion of this story, stating that "Syd would never waste good mandies".{{sfn|Willis|2002a}}

==== Departure from Pink Floyd ====
During Pink Floyd's UK tour with [[Jimi Hendrix]] in November 1967, guitarist [[David O'List]] from [[the Nice]] substituted for Barrett on several occasions when he was unable to perform or failed to appear.<ref name="Mason95-105">{{harvnb|Mason|2011|pp=95–105}}</ref> Around Christmas, Pink Floyd asked Barrett's schoolfriend [[David Gilmour]] to join as a second guitarist to cover for Barrett. For a handful of shows, Gilmour played and sang while Barrett wandered around on stage, occasionally joining the performance. The other band members grew tired of Barrett's antics and, on 26 January 1968, when Waters was driving on the way to a show at [[Southampton University]], they elected not to pick Barrett up. One person in the car said, "Shall we pick Syd up?" and another said, "Let's not bother."<ref>{{cite news | date=January 1995 | title = Gilmour interview in ''Guitar World''}}</ref>{{sfn|Blake|2008|p=112}}<ref name="toby45">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=45}}</ref><ref name="Schaffner14-15">{{harvnb|Schaffner|2005|pp=14–15}}</ref> As Barrett had written the bulk of the band's material, the plan was to retain him as a non-touring member, as the [[The Beach Boys|Beach Boys]] had done with [[Brian Wilson]], but this proved impractical.<ref name="toby45" />{{Sfn|Schaffner|2005|p=265}}<ref name="Schaffner14">{{harvnb|Schaffner|2005|p=14}}</ref>

According to Waters, Barrett came to what was to be their last practice session with a new song he had dubbed "[[Have You Got It Yet?]]". The song seemed simple when he first presented it, but it soon became impossibly difficult to learn; the band eventually realised that Barrett was changing the arrangement as they played,<ref name="toby45" /><ref name="Schaffner14" /> and that Barrett was playing a joke on them.<ref name="tp001">DiLorenzo, Kris. [http://www.schizophrenia.com/stories/sbarrett.htm "Syd Barrett: Careening Through Life."] ''Trouser Press'' February 1978 pp. 26–32</ref> Waters called it "a real act of mad genius".<ref name="toby45" /><ref name="Schaffner14" />

Of the songs Barrett wrote for Pink Floyd after ''The Piper at the Gates of Dawn'', only "[[Jugband Blues]]" was included on their album, ''[[A Saucerful of Secrets]]'' (1968)''.'' "Apples and Oranges" became an unsuccessful single, and "[[Scream Thy Last Scream]]" and "[[Vegetable Man]]", remained unreleased until 2016 in ''[[The Early Years 1965–1972]]'' box set, as they were deemed too dark and unsettling.{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} Barrett played guitar on the ''Saucerful of Secrets'' tracks "[[Remember a Day]]" and "[[Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun]]".<ref name=guitarworld'>1993 ''[[Guitar World]]'' interview with David Gilmour</ref>

Feeling guilty, the members of Pink Floyd were unable to bring themselves to definitively tell Barrett that he was no longer in the band. According to Wright, who lived with Barrett at the time, he told Barrett he was going out to buy cigarettes when leaving to play a show. He would return hours later to find Barrett in the same position, sometimes with a cigarette burned completely down between his fingers (an incident later referenced in Pink Floyd's concert film ''[[Pink Floyd – The Wall|The Wall]]''). Emerging from catatonia and unaware that a long period of time had elapsed, Barrett would ask, "Have you got the cigarettes?".{{sfn|Palacios|2010}}

Barrett supposedly spent time outside the recording studio, in the reception area,<ref name="Schaffner15">{{harvnb|Schaffner|2005|p=15}}</ref> waiting to be invited in. He also came to a few performances and glared at Gilmour.<ref name=guitarworld'/> On 6 April 1968, Pink Floyd officially announced that Barrett was no longer a member,<ref name="Schaffner15" /> the same day their contract with Blackhill Enterprises was terminated. Considering Barrett the band's musical leader, Blackhill Enterprises retained Barrett.{{sfn|Palacios|2010}}<ref name="toby45" /><ref name="Mabbett-3">{{Cite book|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-1-84938-370-7|last=Mabbett|first= Andy|title=Pink Floyd - The Music and the Mystery|location=London|year=2010}}</ref>

=== Solo years (1968–1972) ===

After leaving Pink Floyd, Barrett was out of the public eye for a year.<ref>[http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/the-dark-star-syd-barrett The Dark Star – Syd Barrett], ''Clash Music'', 27 June 2011</ref> In 1969, at the behest of EMI and [[Harvest Records]], he embarked on a brief solo career, releasing two solo albums, ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'' and ''[[Barrett (album)|Barrett]]'' (both 1970), and a single, "[[Octopus (Syd Barrett song)|Octopus]]". Some songs, "[[Terrapin (song)|Terrapin]]", "Maisie" and "[[Bob Dylan Blues]]", reflected Barrett's early interest in the blues.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=9}}

==== ''The Madcap Laughs'' ====
{{Main|The Madcap Laughs}}

After Barrett left Pink Floyd, Jenner followed suit. He led Barrett into EMI Studios to record some tracks<ref name="MCLM3">{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=3}}</ref> in May that would later be released on Barrett's first solo album, ''The Madcap Laughs''. However, Jenner said: "I had seriously underestimated the difficulties of working with him".{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=70}} By the sessions of June and July, most of the tracks were in better shape; however, shortly after the July sessions, Barrett broke up with girlfriend Lindsay Corner and went on a drive around Britain in his Mini, ending up in psychiatric care in Cambridge.<ref name="manning22">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=71}}</ref> During New Year 1969, a somewhat recovered Barrett had taken up tenancy in a flat on [[Egerton Gardens]], [[South Kensington]], London, with the postmodernist artist [[Duggie Fields]].<ref name="manning22" /><ref>{{cite web |author=BdF |title=Prose <!--search for 'Mick Rock's'--> |publisher=Duggie Fields |url=http://www.duggiefields.com/text/text_index.htm |access-date=22 July 2012}}</ref> Here, Barrett's flat was so close to Gilmour's that Gilmour could look right into Barrett's kitchen.<ref name="manning22" /> Deciding to return to music, Barrett contacted EMI and was passed to Malcolm Jones, the then-head of EMI's new [[Progressive rock|prog rock]] label, [[Harvest Records|Harvest]]<ref name="MCLM3" /> (after Norman Smith<ref name="MCLM4">{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=4}}</ref> and Jenner declined to produce Barrett's record,<ref name="MCLM4" /> Jones produced it).<ref name="manning22" /><ref name="MCLM4" /> Barrett wanted to recover the Jenner-produced sessions recordings; several of the tracks were improved upon.<ref name="MCLM3-4">{{harvnb|Jones|2003|pp=3–4}}</ref>

The Jones-produced sessions started in April 1969 at EMI Studios. After the first of these sessions, Barrett brought in friends to help out: [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]] drummer [[Jerry Shirley]], and [[Jokers Wild (band)|Jokers Wild]] (Gilmour's old band) drummer Willie Wilson. For the sessions, Gilmour played bass. Talking to Barrett wasn't easy, said Jones: "It was a case of following him, not playing with him. They were seeing and then playing so they were always a note behind".<ref name="manning22" /> A few tracks on the album feature overdubs by members of the band [[Soft Machine]].<ref name="manning13" /> During this time, Barrett also played guitar on the sessions for Soft Machine founder<!--"founder member" is correct British usage; per MOS:TIES, it should not be changed to "founding member"--> [[Kevin Ayers]]' debut LP ''[[Joy of a Toy]]'',<ref>{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |title=The Harvest Years 1969–1974 – Kevin Ayers : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |date=23 April 2012 |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-harvest-years-1969-1974-mw0002337660 |access-date=5 July 2012}}</ref> although his performance on "Religious Experience" (later titled "[[Singing a Song in the Morning]]") was not released until the album was reissued in 2003.<ref name="manning13" /><ref name="palacios362">{{harvnb|Palacios|2010|p=362}}</ref> One time, Barrett had told his flatmate that he was going off "for an afternoon drive". However, he followed Pink Floyd to [[Ibiza]] (according to legend, he skipped check-ins and customs, ran onto the runway and attempted to flag down a jet). One of his friends, J. Ryan Eaves, bass player for the short-lived but influential Manchester band York's Ensemble, later spotted him on a beach wearing messed-up clothes and with a carrier bag full of money. By this point, during the trip, Barrett had asked Gilmour for his help in the recording sessions.<ref name="manning22" />

After two of the Gilmour/Waters-produced sessions,{{sfn|Parker|2001|p=iv}} they remade one track from the Soft Machine overdubs and recorded three tracks. These sessions came to a minor halt when Gilmour and Waters were mixing Pink Floyd's newly recorded album, ''[[Ummagumma]]'', to Barrett's dismay. However, through the end of July, they managed to record three more tracks. The problem with the recording was that the songs were recorded as Barrett played them "live" in studio. On the released versions a number of them have false starts and commentaries from Barrett.<ref name="manning22" /> Despite the track being closer to complete and better produced, Gilmour and Waters left the Jones-produced track "Opel" off ''Madcap''.{{sfn|Manning|2006|pp=71–72}}

Gilmour later said of the sessions for ''The Madcap Laughs'':

{{Quote| [Sessions] were pretty tortuous and very rushed. We had very little time, particularly with ''The Madcap Laughs''. Syd was very difficult, we got that very frustrated feeling: Look, it's your fucking career, mate. Why don't you get your finger out and do something? The guy was in trouble, and was a close friend for many years before then, so it really was the least one could do.<ref>{{cite web |title=David Gilmour: Record Collector, May 2003 – All Pink Floyd Fan Network |publisher=Pinkfloydfan.net |date=10 January 2001 |url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t3136-david-gilmour-record-collector-may.html |access-date=6 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HcB1jh9u?url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t3136-david-gilmour-record-collector-may.html |archive-date=24 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}

Upon the album's release in January 1970, Malcolm Jones was shocked by the substandard musicianship on the Gilmour and Waters-produced songs: "I felt angry. It's like dirty linen in public and very unnecessary and unkind." Gilmour said: "Perhaps we were trying to show what Syd was really like. But perhaps we were trying to punish him." Waters was more positive: "Syd is a genius."<ref name="manning23">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=72}}</ref>

Barrett said "It's quite nice but I'd be very surprised if it did anything if I were to drop dead. I don't think it would stand as my last statement."<ref name=manning23 />

==== ''Barrett'' ====
{{Main|Barrett (album)}}

The second album, ''Barrett'', was recorded more sporadically than the first,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Nick |title=The Dark Stuff: Selected Writings on Rock Music |year=2007 |publisher=Faber & Faber, Limited |page=121}}</ref> with sessions taking place between February and July 1970.<ref name="manning23" /><ref name="B2010_1-2">{{cite AV media notes |title=Barrett |title-link=Barrett (album) |others=Syd Barrett |year=1970 |pages=1–2 |type=booklet |publisher=[[Harvest Records|Harvest]], [[EMI]]}}</ref> The album was produced by [[David Gilmour]],<ref name="manning23" /><ref name="Manning 2006 61">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=61}}</ref> and featured Gilmour on bass guitar, [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] on keyboard and [[Humble Pie (band)|Humble Pie]] drummer [[Jerry Shirley]]. The first two songs attempted were for Barrett to play and/or sing to an existing backing track. However, Gilmour thought they were losing the "Barrett-ness". One track ("Rats") was originally recorded with Barrett on his own. That would later be overdubbed by musicians, despite the changing tempos. Shirley said of Barrett's playing: "He would never play the same tune twice. Sometimes Syd couldn't play anything that made sense; other times what he'd play was absolute magic." At times Barrett, who experienced [[synaesthesia]],{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} would say: "Perhaps we could make the middle darker and maybe the end a bit middle afternoonish. At the moment it's too windy and icy".<ref name="manning23" />

These sessions were happening while Pink Floyd had just begun to work on ''[[Atom Heart Mother]]''. On various occasions, Barrett went to "spy" on the band as they recorded their album.<ref name="manning23" />

Wright said of the ''Barrett'' sessions:

{{Quote| Doing Syd's record was interesting, but extremely difficult. Dave [Gilmour] and [[Roger Waters|Roger]] did the first one (''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'') and Dave and myself did the second one. But by then it was just trying to help Syd any way we could, rather than worrying about getting the best guitar sound. You could forget about that! It was just going into the studio and trying to get him to sing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rick Wright: Broken China Interview – Aug 1996 – All Pink Floyd Fan Network |publisher=Pinkfloydfan.net |url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t7597-rick-wright-broken-china-interview.html |access-date=6 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6HcB2WTbf?url=http://www.pinkfloydfan.net/t7597-rick-wright-broken-china-interview.html |archive-date=24 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>}}

==== Performances ====
Despite the numerous recording dates for his solo albums, Barrett undertook very little musical activity between 1968 and 1972 outside the studio. On 24 February 1970, he appeared on [[John Peel]]'s [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] radio programme ''[[Top Gear (Music show)|Top Gear]]''<ref name="manning23" /><ref name="MCLM13">{{harvnb|Jones|2003|p=13}}</ref> playing five songs—only one of which had been previously released. Three would be re-recorded for the ''Barrett'' album, while the song "Two of a Kind" was a one-off performance (possibly written by Richard Wright).{{refn|"Two of a Kind" was credited to [[Richard Wright (musician)|Richard Wright]] on the original Peel Session release, but to Barrett on later releases, including ''[[The Best of Syd Barrett: Wouldn't You Miss Me?]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kellman |first=Andy |title=Wouldn't You Miss Me?: The Best of Syd Barrett – Syd Barrett : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/wouldnt-you-miss-me-the-best-of-syd-barrett-mw0000377648 |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref> According to [[David Gilmour]], Wright wrote the song but an increasingly confused Barrett insisted it was his own composition (and wanted to include it on ''[[The Madcap Laughs]]'').<ref name="CrazyDiamond">{{harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=92}}</ref>|group="nb"}} Barrett was accompanied on this session by Gilmour and Shirley who played bass and percussion,<ref name="manning23" /> respectively.{{refn|These five songs were originally released on ''[[The Peel Session (Syd Barrett album)|Syd Barrett: The Peel Session]]''.|group="nb"}}

Gilmour and Shirley also backed Barrett for his one and only live concert during this period.<ref name="Manning 2006 61" /> The gig took place on 6 June 1970 at the Olympia Exhibition Hall as part of a ''Music and Fashion Festival''.<ref name="Irgh270">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=270}}</ref> The trio performed four songs,<ref name="Manning 2006 61" /> "Terrapin", "Gigolo Aunt", "Effervescing Elephant" and "Octopus".

=== Later years (1972–2006) ===

==== Stars and final recordings ====
{{See also|Stars (British band)}}

In February 1972, after a few guest spots in Cambridge with ex-[[Pink Fairies]] member [[Twink (musician)|Twink]] on drums and [[Jack Monck]] on bass using the name The Last Minute Put Together Boogie Band (backing visiting blues musician [[Eddie "Guitar" Burns]] and also featuring Henry Cow guitarist [[Fred Frith]]), the trio formed a short-lived band called [[Stars (British band)|Stars]].<ref name="manning26">{{harvnb|Manning|2006|p=74}}</ref> Though they were initially well received at gigs in the Dandelion coffee bar and the town's Market Square, one of their gigs at the [[Cambridge Corn Exchange|Corn Exchange]] in [[Cambridge]]<ref name="Irghdxv">{{harvnb|Chapman|2010|p=xv}}</ref> with [[MC5]] proved to be disastrous.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=73}} A few days after this final show, Twink recalled that Barrett stopped him on the street, showed him a scathing review of the gig they had played, and quit on the spot,{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=73}} despite having played at least one subsequent gig at the same venue supporting [[Nektar]].{{sfn|Willis|2002a}}

Free from his EMI contract on 9 May 1972, Barrett signed a document that ended his association with Pink Floyd, and any financial interest in future recordings.<ref name="DarkG400">{{harvnb|Palacios|2010|p=400}}</ref> Barrett attended an informal jazz and poetry performance by [[Pete Brown]] and former [[Cream (band)|Cream]] bassist [[Jack Bruce]] in October 1973. Brown arrived at the show late, and saw that Bruce was already onstage, along with "a guitarist I vaguely recognised", playing the [[Horace Silver]] tune "[[Doodlin' (Horace Silver song)|Doodlin']]". Later in the show, Brown read out a poem, which he dedicated to Syd, because, "he's here in Cambridge, and he's one of the best songwriters in the country" when, to his surprise, the guitar player from earlier in the show stood up and said, "No I'm not".{{sfn|Palacios|2010|p=401}} By the end of 1973, Barrett had returned to live in London, staying at various hotels and, in December of that year, settling in at Chelsea Cloisters. He had little contact with others, apart from his regular visits to his management's offices to collect his royalties,<ref name="manning26" /> and the occasional visit from his sister Rosemary.

In August 1974,<ref name="manning26" /> Jenner persuaded Barrett to return to [[Abbey Road Studios]] in hope of recording another album. According to [[John Leckie]], who engineered these sessions, even at this point Syd still "looked like he did when he was younger&nbsp;... long haired".{{sfn|Parker|2001|p=194}} The sessions lasted three days and consisted of blues rhythm tracks with tentative and disjointed guitar overdubs. Barrett recorded eleven tracks, the only one of which to be titled was "If You Go, Don't Be Slow". Once again, Barrett withdrew from the music industry, but this time for good. He sold the rights to his solo albums back to the record label and moved into a London hotel. During this period, several attempts to employ him as a [[record producer]] (including one by [[Jamie Reid]] on behalf of the [[Sex Pistols]], and another by the [[The Damned (band)|Damned]], who wanted him to produce [[Music for Pleasure (The Damned album)|their second album]]) were fruitless.<ref name="manning1993">{{harvnb|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|pp=121–122}}</ref>{{sfn|Schaffner|2005|p=213}}

==== ''Wish You Were Here'' sessions ====
[[File:Syd Barrett Abbey Road 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Barrett visiting [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 5 June 1975]]Barrett visited the members of Pink Floyd in 1975 during the recording sessions for their ninth album, ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]].'' He attended the Abbey Road session unannounced, and watched the band working on the final mix of "[[Shine On You Crazy Diamond]]" — a song about him. By that time, Barrett, then 29, had become overweight and had shaved off all of his hair (including his eyebrows), and his former bandmates did not initially recognise him. Barrett spent part of the session brushing his teeth.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Syd Barrett story|url=http://www.sydbarrett.net/subpages/articles/syd_barrett_story_by_syd_and_tho.htm|access-date=1 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="manning1">Palacios 2010, p. 408</ref> Waters asked him what he thought of the song and he said that it "sounds a bit old".<ref name="manning1" /> He briefly attended the reception for Gilmour's wedding to [[Ginger Gilmour|Ginger]] that immediately followed the recording sessions but left early without exchanging goodbyes with the newlyweds.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

Apart from a brief encounter between Waters and Barrett in [[Harrods]] a couple of years later{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=73}}{{sfn|Palacios|2010|p=412}} (Barrett ran outside when he saw Waters, dropping his bags full of sweets),{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=73}} this was the last time any member of Pink Floyd saw him.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

=== Withdrawal to Cambridge ===
In 1978, when Barrett's money ran out, he moved back to Cambridge to live with his mother. He returned to live in London for a few weeks in 1982, but soon returned to Cambridge permanently. Barrett walked the {{convert|50|mi}} from London to Cambridge.{{sfn|Palacios|2010|p=414}} Until his death, he received royalties from his work with Pink Floyd from each release that featured his songs; Gilmour said, "I made sure the money got to him."<ref name="cambridge-news2006">{{cite news |date=11 November 2006 |title=Barrett leaves £1.25m |newspaper=Cambridge Evening News |url=http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Barrett-leaves125m/story-22479127-detail/story.html |access-date=14 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016041657/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Barrett-leaves125m/story-22479127-detail/story.html |archive-date=16 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1996, Barrett was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Pink Floyd. He did not attend the ceremony.<ref>{{cite book |last=Povey |first=Glenn |title=Echoes – The Complete History of Pink Floyd |year=2007 |publisher=Mind Head Publishing |isbn=978-0-9554624-0-5 |page=286}}</ref>

According to biographer and journalist Tim Willis, Barrett, who had reverted to using his original name Roger, continued to live in his late mother's semi-detached home, and had returned to painting, creating large abstract canvases. He was also said to have been an avid gardener. His main point of contact with the outside world was his sister, Rosemary, who lived nearby.

Although Barrett had not appeared or spoken in public since the mid-1970s, reporters and fans travelled to Cambridge seeking him, despite public appeals from his family.<ref>{{cite web |title=Set The Controls; Interview to Roger 'Syd' Barrett's Nephew |date=22 April 2001 |publisher=Pink-floyd.org |url=http://www.pink-floyd.org/barrett/ianintw.htm |access-date=28 February 2012}}</ref> Apparently, Barrett did not like being reminded about his musical career and the other members of Pink Floyd had no direct contact with him. However, he did visit his sister's house in November 2001 to watch [[The Pink Floyd and Syd Barrett Story|the BBC ''Omnibus'' documentary made about him]]; reportedly he found some of it "a bit noisy", enjoyed seeing Mike Leonard again, calling him his "teacher", and enjoyed hearing "[[See Emily Play]]".<ref name='You shone like the sun'>{{cite news |last=Willis |first=Tim |title=You shone like the sun |date=6 October 2002 |location=London |work=The Observer |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,804928,00.html |access-date=17 February 2007}}</ref>

Barrett made a final public acknowledgement of his musical past in 2002, his first since the 1970s, when he autographed 320 copies of photographer [[Mick Rock]]'s book ''Psychedelic Renegades,'' which contained a number of photos of Barrett. Rock was perhaps the last person in the music industry with whom Barrett kept in contact. In 1971, Rock conducted Barrett's final interview before his retirement from the music industry.

Barrett wrote most of Pink Floyd's early material. According to critic [[Steven Hyden]], even after Barrett left the band, Barrett's spirit "haunted" their records, and their most popular work "drew on the power of what Barrett signified".<ref name="Steven Hyden">{{cite book|last=Hyden|first=Steven|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zJElDwAAQBAJ|title=Twilight of the Gods: A Journey to the End of Classic Rock|date=2018|publisher=Dey Street|isbn=9780062657121|page=27|author-link=Steven Hyden}}</ref>

Barrett was an innovative guitarist, using [[extended techniques]] and exploring the musical and sonic possibilities of [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]], [[distortion]], [[Audio feedback|feedback]], the [[echo machine]], tapes and other effects; his experimentation was partly inspired by free improvisation guitarist [[Keith Rowe]] of the group  [[AMM (group)|AMM]], active at the time in London.{{sfn|Palacios|2010|p=101}} One of Barrett's trademarks was playing his guitar through an old echo box while sliding a [[Zippo lighter]] up and down the fret-board to create the mysterious, otherworldly sounds that became associated with the group.

[[Daevid Allen]], founder<!--"founder member" is correct British usage; per MOS:TIES, it should not be changed to "founding member"--> member of [[Soft Machine]] and [[Gong (band)|Gong]], cited Barrett's use of slide guitar with echo as a key inspiration for his own "glissando guitar" style.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.planetgong.co.uk/outland/wiki/pmwiki.php/MizMaze/DaevidAllen |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130421084208/http://www.planetgong.co.uk/outland/wiki/pmwiki.php/MizMaze/DaevidAllen |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 April 2013 |title=Gong Family Maze &#124; MizMaze / DaevidAllen |publisher=Planetgong.co.uk |access-date=21 July 2012 }}</ref>

Barrett's recordings both with Pink Floyd and in later solo albums were delivered with a strongly British-accented vocal delivery, specifically that of southern England.

Barrett also had an influence on [[alternative rock|alternative]] and [[punk rock|punk]] music in general. According to critic [[John Harris (critic)|John Harris]]:
<blockquote>
To understand his place in modern music you probably have to first go back to punk rock and its misguided attempt to kick aside what remained of the psychedelic 1960s. Given that the Clash and [[Sex Pistols]] had made brutal social commentary obligatory, there seemed little room for any of the creative exotica that had defined the Love Decade&nbsp;– until, slowly but surely, singing about dead-end lives and dole queues began to pall, and at least some of the previous generation were rehabilitated. Barrett was the best example: having crashed out of [[Pink Floyd]] before the advent of indulgent [[Progressive rock|"progressive" rock]], and succumbed to a fate that appealed to the punk generation's nihilism, he underwent a revival.<ref>{{cite news|author1=John Harris|title=Barrett's influence|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/jul/12/popandrock.sydbarrett2|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 12, 2006}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Barrett's decline had a profound effect on Waters' songwriting, and the theme of mental illness permeated the later Pink Floyd albums ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' (1973), ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' (1975) and ''[[The Wall]]'' (1979).<ref name="Schaffner16">{{harvnb|Schaffner|2005|p=16}}</ref> The reference to a "steel rail" in the song "[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]"<ref name="Schaffner18">{{harvnb|Schaffner|2005|p=18}}</ref> ''–'' "can you tell a green field from a cold steel rail?"

In 1987, an album of Barrett cover songs called ''[[Beyond the Wildwood]]'' was released. The album was a collection of cover songs from Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd and from his solo career. Artists appearing were UK and US [[indie band]]s including [[The Shamen]], [[Opal (band)|Opal]], [[The Soup Dragons]], and [[Plasticland]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Rabid |first=Jack |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/beyond-the-wildwood-mw0000957788 |title=Beyond the Wildwood – Various Artists : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=3 October 2012}}</ref>

Other artists who have written tributes to Barrett include his contemporary [[Kevin Ayers]], who wrote "O Wot a Dream" in his honour (Barrett provided guitar to an early version of Ayers' song "Religious Experience: Singing a Song in the Morning").<ref name="manning13" /><ref name="palacios362" /> [[Robyn Hitchcock]] has covered many of his songs live and on record and paid homage to his forebear with the song "(Feels Like) 1974".

In ''Saucerful of Secrets: The Pink Floyd Odyssey'', author [[Nicholas Schaffner]] interviewed people who knew Barrett before and during his Pink Floyd days, including friends Peter and Susan Wynne-Wilson, artist [[Duggie Fields]] (with whom Barrett shared a flat during the late 1960s), June Bolan, and [[Storm Thorgerson]]. Bolan became concerned when Syd "kept his girlfriend under lock and key for three days, occasionally shoving a ration of biscuits under the door".{{sfn|Schaffner|2005|p=77}} A claim of cruelty against Barrett committed by the groupies and hangers-on who frequented his apartment during this period was described by writer and critic [[Jonathan Meades]]. "I went [to Barrett's flat] to see Harry and there was this terrible noise. It sounded like heating pipes shaking.

Other friends state that Barrett's flatmates, nicknamed Mad Jock and Mad Sue, believed that acid held all the answers{{tone inline|date=August 2019}}, thought of Barrett as a genius or a deity, and were spiking his morning coffee with LSD every day without his knowledge, leaving him in a never-ending trip. He was later rescued from that flat by friends and moved elsewhere, but his erratic behaviour continued.{{sfn|Palacios|2010}} According to Thorgerson, "On one occasion, I had to pull him [Barrett] off [his girlfriend] Lindsay because he was beating her over the head with a [[mandolin]]".{{sfn|Watkinson|Anderson|2001|p=83}} On one occasion, Barrett threw a woman called Gilly across the room, because she refused to go to Gilmour's house.{{sfn|Manning|2006|p=73}}

According to his sister, Rosemary, Barrett took up photography and sometimes they went to the seaside together.  She also said he took a keen interest in art and horticulture and continued to devote himself to painting:

{{quote|Quite often he took the train on his own to London to look at the major art collections—and he loved flowers.
