'''Bôa''' (stylized '''bôa''') is an English [[alternative rock|alternative]]/[[indie rock|indie]] band formed in [[London]] in 1993 by drummer Ed Herten, keyboard player Paul Turrell, and guitarist/vocalist Steve Rodgers. The band progressed from a funk band to a rock band over the years, as bassist Alex Caird and multi-instrumentalist Ben Henderson joined the group, and Jasmine Rodgers was added as vocalist. They produced two major albums, ''[[Twilight (Bôa album)|Twilight]]'' (2001) and [[Get There (Bôa album)|''Get There'']] (2005). Their track "Duvet" was the opening theme song to the anime television series ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''. The band was originally signed by Polystar in Japan and produced their first album 'Race of a Thousand Camels' (1998). However, the band decided to change labels and signed with Pioneer LDC (now called [[Geneon]]) to produce their album ''Twilight'' (2001). Bôa's current lineup consists of Jasmine Rodgers (vocals), Steve Rodgers (vocals & guitar), Alex Caird (bass), and [[Lee Sullivan]] (drums & piano).

Following their success with ''Twilight'', the band decided to create their own independent label called Bôa Recordings to produce. ''[[Get There (Bôa album)|Get There]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soundunwound.com/music/boa/35909?ref=AADP |title=Amazon.com: Digital Music |website=Soundunwound.com |date= |accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref> was released on 1 February 2005. It took Bôa in a new direction, with more structure in lyrics and melody, as well as a more mellow, yet more harder-edged/indie rock format. It also had more acoustic elements than the first album.

==Career==
[[File:Jasmine Rodgers singer songwriter (cropped).jpg|thumb|Jasmine Rodgers is the lead vocalist of the group]]
Originally a [[funk]] band, Bôa was formed in 1993 by drummer Ed Herten, keyboardist Paul Turrell, and Steve Rodgers on guitar and vocals.

Alex Caird, who had played with Ed in another band Draggin' Bones, was soon recruited on bass guitar. Steve's younger sister, Jasmine Rodgers, was invited to sing the chorus part of one of their first songs called "Fran", and she soon became the lead singer of the group. Ben Henderson, who had played with Alex in the band Doctor Sky, was recruited shortly afterwards to play saxophone.

Their first live performance was in January 1994 at the [[London Forum]] supporting Steve and Jasmine's father, [[classic rock]] singer [[Paul Rodgers]] (of [[Free (band)|Free]] & [[Bad Company]] fame).<ref>{{cite web|author=MacKenzie Wilson |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/p461702/biography |title=Boa &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref> In the summer of the same year, Ed Herten decided to leave the band to concentrate on his studies. The new drummer, [[Lee Sullivan]], is the son of Terry Sullivan, the drummer in the band [[Renaissance (band)|Renaissance]]. Lee brought a rockier feel to the group's sound which complemented a natural progression away from funk by the band and a migration from saxophone to guitar by Ben Henderson.

Bôa honed their live performances with many gigs across the South of England such as the Glastonbury festival (1995). As a result of their Glastonbury performance, they were chosen as the focus of a TV documentary about the festival that was later distributed on the London show "Shift".  In 1996, they accepted a recording contract with a Japanese Company, Polystar. They recorded three songs, "Twilight", "Deeply", and "Elephant" in London, with producer [[Darren Allison]] (Spiritualized, The Divine Comedy) at the Red Bus studios in London. They recorded further tracks for the album with producer Neil Walsh at the Monnow Valley Studios.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artinbase.info/artist/2854/B%C3%B4a/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006072043/http://artinbase.info/artist/2854/B%C3%B4a/ |archivedate=6 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Although the album was recorded and produced in England, Jasmine and Steve traveled to [[Japan]] in 1998 to promote the debut album ''[[The Race of a Thousand Camels|Race of the Thousand Camels]]'', which was released only in that country.

While signed with Polystar, the band released their first single in 1998, called "Duvet".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://songmeanings.com/songs/view/40221/|title=BoA - Duvet Lyrics|website=Songmeanings.com|accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref> It was an instant success in Japan and became the opening theme of the [[anime]] series ''[[Serial Experiments Lain]]''. "Duvet" was also on the 1998 album ''Race of a Thousand Camels'' in Japan. Meanwhile, Boa was working with producer [[Stuart Epps]] on new material including an acoustic version of "Duvet" and the song "Drinking".

In 2000, Polystar released both the ''[[Tall Snake EP]]'', and featured "Duvet" on the ''20th Anniversary of Polystar Collection Vol.1 Female Vocal Love Songs'' compilation. The ''Tall Snake EP'' was released in Japan featuring all three versions of "Duvet" and two songs ("Little Miss" and "Two Steps"). However, in 2000, Ben Henderson left the band to concentrate on his other band, Moth, with his wife, singer songwriter Tina Henderson, who currently record and perform regularly at [[Steampunk]] festivals and events in the UK.

Bôa began touring more extensively and used this time to gain inspiration for their next album. In 2000, Bôa performed a live concert at the [[Otakon]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/convention/2000/otakon |title=Otakon 2000 Report |website=Animenewsnetwork.com |date= |accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref> convention and was well received by fans of the ''Serial Experiments Lain'' series. In September 2002, they held a live performance at the Hammersmith Apollo (London) and received strong accolades for their performance.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/boalive2002.htm |title=Boa Live Hammersmith Apollo September 2002 at Musical Discoveries |website=Musicaldiscoveries.com |date= |accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref>

In 2001, due to contractual disagreements with Polystar, the band changed labels and signed with Pioneer LDC (now known as Geneon Universal). ''Race of a Thousand Camels'' was retitled [[Twilight (Bôa album)|''Twilight'']] and released to a US audience in 2001 by Pioneer Music. ''Twilight'' consisted of songs from their original Japanese album plus other new tracks. They worked closely with Todd Culberhouse and toured in the US to promote the album. Halfway through the tour, Paul Turrell left the band to pursue other interests. However, the band went on to finish the tour and played at the Animefest in Dallas, Texas (Aug 2001).

"Duvet" was remixed<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ex.org/4.6/35-cd_lain.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910102459/http://www.ex.org/4.6/35-cd_lain.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> by [https://web.archive.org/web/20121006072043/http://artinbase.info/artist/2854/B%C3%B4a/ DJ Wasei] and in October 2003 was released on another ''Lain'' soundtrack titled ''Serial Experiment Lain Soundtrack: Cyberia Mix''. The band also released a video to go with the single which was reported to have been filmed on top of the roof of [[Lee Sullivan]]'s flat.

By 2003, the band decided to establish their own recording label, called Boa Recordings. They started recording their third successful album titled [[Get There (Bôa album)|''Get There'']] and released it under their own label in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/389406-bôa|title=bôa|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref>  The album is currently on sale at the [[iTunes Store]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=76843437&s=143444&i=76843250 |title=Bôa at the iTunes Store |access-date=22 August 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011017/http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?playlistId=76843437&s=143444&i=76843250 |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> However, both their albums ''Twilight'' and ''Get There'' can be found on their official distributor [http://www.cdbaby.com/Artist/Boa CD Baby].

In September 2004, Steve and Jasmine performed "Drinking" with their father, Paul Rodgers, at [[The Strat Pack]]. The Strat Pack was a concert featuring Joe Walsh, Gary Moore, Brian May, David Gilmour, and many more, marking the 50th Anniversary of the Fender Stratocaster guitar. The film was released in 2005.

In 2012, the band started a [[JustGiving]] page and announced their support to raise money for AAR JAPAN, a charity that responded to the impact of the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011 tsunami]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/boa-music|title=BOA's page|website=JustGiving.com|accessdate=2020-06-02}}</ref>

On 5 January 2017, the band announced, on their official Facebook page, the death of former keyboard player Paul Turrell that had happened one day prior.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BoAUK/posts/10154463780838645|title=Bôa Facebook post|date=2017-01-05|website=Facebook.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331200441/https://www.facebook.com/BoAUK/posts/10154463780838645|archive-date=2017-03-31|url-status=|access-date=2017-04-02}}</ref>

In May 2017, an unreleased album was discovered on late keyboard player Paul Turrell's website titled "The Farm."<ref>{{cite web|title=Index of /music/boa/unpublished|url=http://paulturrell.com/music/boa/unpublished/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170331200609/http://paulturrell.com/music/boa/unpublished/|archive-date=2017-03-31|website=paulturrell.com}}</ref>
