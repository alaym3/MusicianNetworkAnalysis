==Early life==
Joan Sebastian was born in the rural town of [[Juliantla]] in [[Guerrero]]. He began composing at the age of seven.<ref name="ascap">{{cite web|last1=Pyror|first1=Tom|title=Joan Sebastian: The People's Poet|url=http://www.ascap.com/playback/2004/fall/sebastian.aspx|website=[[ASCAP]]|access-date=14 July 2015|date=30 April 2004}}</ref> His mother enrolled him in a school near [[Guanajuato]] when he was eight years old, and returned to his hometown three years later.<ref name="allmusic"/>

At age fourteen, his father sent him away to a monastery in [[Morelos]] where he was under the care of Father David Salgado. Due to the clergyman's influence on Sebastian, he considered becoming a priest. He enrolled in the Seminario Conciliar de San José in [[Cuernavaca, Morelos]], but realized that he wanted to pursue a music career, and decided to leave the seminary to dedicate himself to music.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/joan-sebast%C3%ADan-mn0000784617/biography|title=Joan Sebastían Biography|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

==Career==
Before embarking on a singing career, Sebastian was an administrative assistant at a vacation resort in [[Oaxtepec, Morelos]], where he would sing through the intercom. In 1968, Sebastian met Mexican actress [[Angelica Maria]]. They stayed together and she asked him to sing some songs for her.<ref name="ascap"/> She suggested to Sebastian that he record the songs and give them to music producer Eduardo Magallanes, though Sebastian never managed to contact him.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.laopinion.com/joan-sebastian-y-su-camino-al-exito|title=Joan Sebastian y su camino al éxito|work=La Opinión|date=13 July 2015|access-date=14 July 2015|language=es}}</ref> He later moved to [[Mexico City]] and began asking Discos Capitals Records to listen to his music and produce it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.besthotelsinmcallen.com/state-farm-arena-welcomes-los-tigres-del-norte-and-joan-sebastian/|title=State Farm Arena Welcomes Los Tigres del Norte and Joan Sebastian|publisher=Best Hotels in McAllen|date=21 August 2014|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> In 1974, he recorded his first album, ''Pedro Parrandas'', and received positive feedback from the public.<ref name="ascap"/>

A few months after his death [[Televisa]] announced that a series about his life would begin filming. His youngest son, Julian Figueroa, portrayed his father in his younger days while his older son, José Manuel Figueroa, portrayed his father in his later days. [[Livia Brito]] was also confirmed to portray Maribel Guardia. The series ''[[Por Siempre Joan Sebastian]]'' premiered on June 27, 2016 on Univision and concluded on July 25, 2016.

On January 27, 2019, a nephew-in-law of Sebastian, Hugo Figueroa, was kidnapped before the start of a bull riding event in [[Tarímbaro]], [[Michoacán]]. On January 31, he was found dead with multiple gunshot wounds, at kilometer 294 of the [[Mexico-Guadalajara highway]]. This marked the third violent death in the famous Mexican family. A video allegedly depicting his murder has circulated online. Figueroa was buried not far from his uncle-in-law's grave.

==Illness and death==
Sebastian was first diagnosed with [[bone cancer]] in 1999. He underwent cancer treatment and survived; however, he announced that the cancer had returned in 2007.

In 2014, he revealed that he was battling cancer for the fourth time during his performances in [[Zacatecas]].

Weeks prior to his death, he confirmed to the media that he had been hospitalized and undergoing cancer treatment under medical supervision.

Relatives of the late singer complained in July 2020 that Sebastian's mausoleum had been broken into and the family feared that his bones might be stolen.
