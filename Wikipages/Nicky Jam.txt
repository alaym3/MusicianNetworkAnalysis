'''Nick Rivera Caminero''' (born March 17, 1981), known professionally as '''Nicky Jam''', is an American singer, songwriter, rapper and actor. He is best known for hits such as "[[X (Nicky Jam and J Balvin song)|X]]", "[[Travesuras]]", "En la Cama", "Te Busco", "[[El Perdón]]", "[[Hasta el Amanecer]]", and "[[El Amante]]"; the latter three are from his 2017 album ''[[Fénix (Nicky Jam album)|Fénix]]''. He has frequently collaborated with other Latin artists such as [[Daddy Yankee]], [[J Balvin]], [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]], [[Plan B (duo)|Plan B]] and [[Anuel AA]]. While his early music exemplified traditional fast-paced reggaeton, his newer compositions place more emphasis on sung vocals and romantic lyrics.

Born in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts]] to a Dominican mother and a Puerto Rican father, his family moved to Puerto Rico when he was ten years old. He began recording music at age fourteen with his first EP ''[[...Distinto a los demás]]'' (1995), and eventually caught the attention of Daddy Yankee. The two formed the group Los Cangris, which was active from the late 1990s to 2004. The pair split acrimoniously and Nicky Jam's career quickly took a sharp decline, followed by a period of legal struggles and substance abuse.<ref>{{Cite web|date=December 14, 2018|title=Así sonaba Nicky Jam en su faceta de "El Niño Raggamuffin"|url=https://heabbi.com/nicky-jam-nino-ragamuffin|access-date=February 18, 2021|website=Heabbi.com|language=es}}</ref>

He then moved to Medellín, Colombia, where he rejuvenated his career and developed a more melodic style of music, which proved to be popular through the release of the singles "Voy a Beber" and "Travesuras" in 2014. His success was furthered by the 2015 single "El Perdón" and his 2017 album ''Fénix''. He released the album ''[[Íntimo]]'' in 2019, which was a critical and commercial success. Nicky Jam has also acted in the films ''[[XXX: Return of Xander Cage]]'' (2017) and ''[[Bad Boys for Life]]'' (2020), and starred in and executive produced the [[Netflix]] biographical series ''[[Nicky Jam: El Ganador]]'' (2018).

While working at the Pueblo Xtra discount grocery store at age eleven, he passed time by rapping about the items he was bagging, which impressed a customer who invited him to record with a local indie label.<ref name=triumphed/><ref name=48hours/> He subsequently signed a contract without reading it and received no advance money for his recordings.<ref name=48hours/> He recorded and released his first EP ''[[...Distinto a los demás]]'' in 1995 at age fourteen.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Nicky Jam lamenta el fallecimiento de un amigo|url=https://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/farandula/notas/nicky-jam-lamenta-el-fallecimiento-de-un-amigo/|access-date=December 22, 2020|website=Primera Hora|date=September 11, 2020|language=es}}</ref><ref name=thefirsttime/><ref name=lovesupreme>{{cite web|url=https://www.vibe.com/featured/nicky-jam-vibe-viva-interview|title=Nicky Jam: A Love Supreme|work=Vibe|last=Estevez|first=Marjua|date=February 14, 2020|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> He endured a difficult breakup with his girlfriend shortly after the album's release and the emotional pain of the experience led him to try [[cocaine]] for the first time at age fifteen.<ref name=lovesupreme/> Nicky Jam reflected on the experience by saying: "[I thought], 'why am I going to take care of myself? My dad didn't handle his drug problems. My mom did drugs too, so why not me?' I mean, I had drugs all around me, and the foundation of everything is your home. It's your family."<ref name=lovesupreme/>

=== 1997–2006: Los Cangris and career decline ===
[[File:Daddy Yankee - The Kingdom (Official Q & A).png|thumb|upright=0.85|left|Nicky Jam formed the duo Los Cangris with his idol and mentor, [[Daddy Yankee]] ''(pictured)''.]]
Despite his drug use, he managed to gain popularity in Puerto Rico as a hip-hop artist, and eventually met his idol, [[Daddy Yankee]]. Nicky Jam recalled that Daddy Yankee was familiar with his work, explaining, "He looked at me and said, 'I know who you are. You're that little kid that sings rap in a little [[Mickey Mouse]] voice. I like your style.'"<ref name=thefirsttime/> The two artists then formed a duo called Los Cangris. The duo achieved success in Puerto Rico through hit singles such as "En la Cama" and "Guayando".<ref name=triumphed/> While in the group, he went on to release the solo albums ''[[Haciendo escante]]'' (2001) and ''[[Vida escante]]'' (2004).<ref name="allmusic"/>

However, Nicky Jam struggled to adjust to his new lifestyle and began using drugs and alcohol to an extent that concerned his musical partner.<ref name=triumphed/> Having used cocaine on and off since age fifteen, he later began using [[percocet]].<ref name=48hours/> Daddy Yankee began to criticize Nicky Jam's behavior and alluded to his bandmate in songs, including the lyric "your courage depends on a pill" from the 2004 song "Santifica Tus Escapularios".<ref name=48hours/> This led an incensed Nicky Jam to release a diss track in response that same year. Nicky Jam quickly regretted releasing the song, explaining, "That wasn't a good choice, because he came with [2004 ''Billboard'' Hot 100 hit] '[[Gasolina]].' [I] looked stupid. He went his way, I went my way -- and obviously my way didn't go very well."<ref name=triumphed/>

Los Cangris separated in 2004 after a falling out between the two musicians.<ref name=reconciliation>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/music/2020/01/08/nicky-jam-daddy-yankee-new-album-los-cangris/|title= Nicky Jam and Daddy Yankee dropping new album as Los Cangris in 2020 on heels of reconciliation|work=Entertainment Weekly|last=Cordero|first=Rosy|date=January 8, 2020|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref> After the breakup of Los Cangris, Nicky Jam struggled personally and professionally, calling himself the "embarrassment of the Latin Caribbean music industry".<ref name=lovesupreme/> Deeply depressed, Nicky Jam gained a significant amount of weight, eventually reaching 300 pounds (136&nbsp;kg). He also experienced legal troubles, including a police chase in his car that was in the process of being repossessed.<ref name=48hours/> He took a job in a hotel, performing lounge music for tourists.<ref name=triumphed/> Despite viewing this period to be his "lowest point", the artist developed his singing voice during this time, learning to incorporate sung vocals into his music as opposed to strictly rapping.<ref name=triumphed/>

=== 2007–2016: Career renewal and successful singles ===
{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#bbccff |salign=left |width=240px |align=right | quote =  People laugh when I say I came to Colombia and cleaned myself out of alcohol and drugs.

In 2007, Nicky Jam moved to Medellín, Colombia in an attempt to stop using drugs and focus on music. The musician was well received by the people in Medellín, and the singer reflected, "They made me feel like I was a legend. The boost they gave me made me want to be a better person. I started eating OK, I stopped drugs, I stopped alcohol. People came to love me because I was loving myself."<ref name=triumphed/> In 2010, Nicky Jam suffered a nearly fatal overdose that served as the impetus for him to quit using drugs completely.<ref name=lovesupreme/> He lost 100 pounds (45&nbsp;kg) and tattooed a significant portion of his body, including the entirety of his neck&mdash;which he considered a symbol of his recovery.<ref name=48hours/> Artistically, he drew influence from the romanticism of Colombian music, in particular the genre of [[vallenato]].<ref name=48hours/> He also amended his friendship with Daddy Yankee after encountering him on a flight, where the two apologized to each other, and began touring together at the end of 2014.<ref name=triumphed/>

His songs "Voy a Beber" and "[[Travesuras]]" reinvigorated his career and led to his signing with Sony U.S. Latin.<ref name=triumphed/> "Travesuras" was Nicky Jam's first song to reach the top ten on the ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7677131/nicky-jam-fenix-no-1-top-latin-albums-chart|title=Nicky Jam's 'Fenix' Lands at No. 1 on Top Latin Albums Chart|work=Billboard|first=Amaya|last=Mendizabal|date=February 2, 2017|access-date=February 15, 2018}}</ref> Spanish singer [[Enrique Iglesias]] contacted Nicky Jam to collaborate on the 2015 song "[[El Perdón]]", which later won Nicky Jam his first Latin Grammy for Best Urban Performance.<ref name=thefirsttime/> Nicky Jam was surprised when he received the phone call from Iglesias and initially hung up on him, believing the call to be a prank.<ref name=triumphed/> The song peaked at number 56 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and spent 30 weeks on top of the [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart.<ref name=hot100>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/Nicky-Jam/chart-history/HSI|title=Billboard Hot 100 - Nicky Jam Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=April 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fernandez |first1=Suzette |title=Listen to 'Despacito', 'Bailando', 'La Tortura' & More of the Longest-Running Hot Latin Songs No. 1s |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8099172/longest-running-hot-latin-songs-number-ones-listen |website=Billboard |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |access-date=May 29, 2020 |date=February 12, 2018}}</ref>
