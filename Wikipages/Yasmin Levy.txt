'''Yasmin Levy''' ({{lang-he|יסמין לוי}}; born December 23, 1975) is an [[Israel]]i singer-songwriter of [[Judeo-Spanish]] music.

==Biography==
Levy is of [[Sephardic Jewish]] descent.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://esefarad.com/?p=80016|title=Yasmin Levy Makes Music out of Madness|website=eSefarad|language=es|access-date=September 1, 2019}}</ref> Her parents were [[Aliyah|immigrants]] from [[Turkish Jews|Turkey]].<ref name=":0" /> Her late father, [[Yitzhak Isaac Levy]] (1919–1977),<ref>[http://www.mvdaily.com/articles/l/y/yitzhak-levy.htm "Music & Vision"]</ref> was a composer and [[hazzan]] (cantor), as well as a pioneer researcher into the history of the [[Ladino language|Ladino]] music and culture of [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spanish Jewry]] and its [[diaspora]], being the editor of the Ladino language magazine ''Aki Yerushalayim''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20081109064418/http://www.aki-yerushalayim.co.il/index.htm Aki Yerushalayim]</ref>

==Career==
With her distinctive and emotive style, Levy has brought a new interpretation to the medieval [[Judeo-Spanish]] (Ladino) song by incorporating more "modern" sounds of Andalusian [[flamenco]] and traditional Turkish music<ref name=":0" /> as well as combining instruments like the [[darbuka]], [[oud]], violin, cello, and piano.

Her debut album was ''Romance & Yasmin'' in 2000, which earned her a nomination as "Best Newcomer" for the [[fRoots]] / [[BBC Radio 3]] [[World Music]] Awards 2005, followed in 2005 with her second album ''La Judería'' ({{lang-es|link=no|The Jewish Quarter}}). In 2006, she was nominated again, then in the category "Culture Crossing".<ref>{{Cite web

On her second album, ''La Judería'', she also covered the popular songs "[[Gracias a la Vida]]" by [[Violeta Parra]] and "Nací en Álamo" from the film ''[[Vengo (film)|Vengo]]'', directed by [[Tony Gatlif]], which in its original version won the 2001 [[César Award for Best Music Written for a Film]] (itself being a cover<ref>{{Cite web

Levy's work earned her the [[Anna Lindh Memorial Fund|Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation Award]] for promoting cross-cultural dialogue between musicians from three cultures.<ref>{{Cite web

}}</ref> In her own words:

<blockquote>I am proud to combine the two cultures of Ladino and flamenco, while mixing in Middle Eastern influences. I am embarking on a 500-year-old musical journey, taking Ladino to Andalusia and mixing it with flamenco, the style that still bears the musical memories of the old Moorish and Jewish-Spanish world with the sound of the Arab world. In a way it is a ‘musical reconciliation’ of history.<ref>{{Cite web
