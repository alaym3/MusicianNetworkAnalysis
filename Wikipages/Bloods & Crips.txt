'''Bloods & Crips''' was a [[gangsta rap]] group from [[Los Angeles County]] mostly known for their record selling song Piru Love.

== History ==
The success of [[N.W.A.]] had frustrated many in the gang community who saw the group capitalizing on the gang lifestyle. The Bloods & Crips project was originally organized by rappers [[O.Y.G Redrum 781]] and [[Tweedy Bird Loc]].<ref name="redrum781">[http://www.raptalk.net/news/features/ExclusiveInterviewWithBanginOnWaxOriginalRedRum781.php Exclusive interview with redruM781] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714231334/http://www.raptalk.net/news/features/ExclusiveInterviewWithBanginOnWaxOriginalRedRum781.php |date=2009-07-14 }} RapTalk.net. 2008-04-11 Retrieved. 2008-04-11</ref> Actual gang members, [[Crips]] from [[Compton, California|Compton]], [[Watts, California|Watts]] and [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Bloods]] from [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[Los Angeles]] auditioned for the group and the best ones were chosen for the album.<ref name="amg">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p37467/biography|pure_url=yes}} Bloods & Crips biography] at [[Allmusic]] AllMusic.com 2014-05-17 Retrieved. 2014-05-17</ref> In 1993, the Bloods & Crips released their debut album entitled ''[[Bangin' on Wax]]'' for Warlock Records. One year later, the group's second and final studio album, ''[[Bangin' on Wax 2... The Saga Continues]]'' was released. After ''Bangin' on Wax 2'', the Bloods & Crips parted ways, with the Bloods becoming the '''Damu Ridas''' and the Crips became the '''Nationwide Rip Ridaz'''.

=== Albums ===
==== First ====
''[[Bangin' on Wax]]'' was the first album by Bloods & Crips. The album was released in 1993 under Dangerous Records. ''Bangin' on Wax'' was a success, making it to No. 86 on the [[Billboard 200]].<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r176021|pure_url=yes}} "Bangin'" on Wax at Billboard] BillBoard.com 2014-05-17 Retrieved 2014-05-17</ref> Four singles were released "Bangin' on Wax", "Piru Love", "Crip, Crip, Crip" and "Steady Dippin'". The album went on to sell over 500,000 copies, achieving Gold status. Official music videos for "Bangin' on Wax", "Piru Love" and "Steady Dippin'" were made, gaining widespread attention for the group.

On the group's single "Piru Love", the hook is sung by Fo' Clips Eclipse, one of the group's Crip members.

The next single, "Steady Dippin'", was performed by Crip members Do Or Die (a.k.a. A-Love), Miss C-Note (a.k.a. Dannygirl), Sin Loc, and Blue Ragg (a.k.a. The General). They emerged a group called the '''Underworld Connection'''. The Underworld Connection was formed in the early 1990s but was put on hold for projects like Tweedy Bird Loc's "[[187 Ride By]]" and the controversial album ''Bangin' On Wax''. It was the first time the group reconnected in the late 2000s since the 1990s. Also [[Battlecat (producer)|DJ Battlecat]] made an appearance in the "Steady Dippin'" music video as the event's DJ for the intro. The song was produced by him along with QLuso and Ronnie Ron.<ref>[http://www.whosampled.com/Bloods-%26-Crips/Steady-Dippin%27/ "Steady Dippin'" by Bloods & Crips] WhoSampled.com 2014-05-19 Retrieved. 2014-05-19</ref>

==== Second ====
''[[Bangin' on Wax 2... The Saga Continues]]'' was the second and last album by the Bloods & Crips. Music videos were made for the album singles "G's & Locs" and "Wish You Were Here". Both videos gained positive reviews. The album was recorded and released in 1994 under Dangerous Records. The album made it to No. 139 on the [[Billboard 200]] and #20 for Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums.<ref>{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r206084}} AllMusic.com 2014-05-17 Retrieved. 2014-05-17</ref>

'''Third'''

A third album: ''Bangin’ on Wax Part 3: No Passes'' was originally recorded in 2004, but not released until 2014. None of the original artists are featured on the album, although it was still distributed through Dangerous Records with the help of Tweedy Bird Loc, following the death of producer Ronnie M. Phillips on November 1, 2003, over a decade prior to release.<ref>{{Citation|title=Bloods & Crips – Bangin On Wax Part III (No Passes) (2014, CD)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Bloods-Crips-Bangin-On-Wax-Part-III-No-Passes/release/5642138|language=en|access-date=2021-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Ronnie M Phillips|url=https://www.ancientfaces.com/person/ronnie-m-phillips-birth-1954-death-2003/89145468|access-date=2021-03-31|website=AncientFaces|language=en}}</ref>

=== Internal feuds ===
At the height of their success, the Bloods & Crips became a target for '''Lil' Keke Loco''' of the [[Rollin' 30s Harlem Crips]] and [[Niggaz Off The Streets]] (N.O.T.S.), another [[Gangsta rap|gangsta]] rap group. Keke Loco even dedicated a [[Diss track|diss]] track called "Bustas' on Wax", which was considered "slanderous" to the original album "Bangin' On Wax" and took numerous shots at members of the Bloods & Crips, including Bloody Mary, [[O.Y.G Redrum 781]], AWOL, Big Wy, Sin Loc, and many more. Criticizing them for collaborating with rival street gangs, Keke Loco considers the members from "Bangin' on Wax", a disgrace to all real [[Bloods]] and [[Crips]]. "Its disrespectful to all the fallen gang members who lost they life over colors, it's like spitting on their graves", Loco said.

One of the main rappers from the Bloods & Crips, Lil' Leak (also known as CK) retaliated with several verbal insults of his own. Lil' Leak and Damu Ridas also dedicated a whole verse on a song called "CK Ride" and "True Flue Killer"  to insulting Keke Loco and his fellow N.O.T.S. (True Blue).

The "Dirty" is a derogatory term, and a reference to the Rollin 30's Harlem Crips. Shortly after the album ''"[[Bangin' on Wax 2... The Saga Continues]]"'' was released, the Damu Ridas members from the album ran across Lil Keke Loco and buried the feud.<ref>[http://unitedgangs.com/2010/04/16/lil-keke-loco-true-blue/ Bustas' on Wax by Keke Loco] UnitedGangs.com 2014-05-20 Retrieved. 2014-05-20</ref><ref>[http://unitedgangs.com/2014/02/13/lil-leak-bloods-crips/ CK: Feud with Lil Keke Loco] UnitedGangs.com 2014-05-20 Retrieved. 2014-05-20</ref>
