'''Reynaldo Valera Guardiano''', better known as '''Rey Valera''' (born 4 May 1954), is a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] singer, songwriter, music director, film scorer and television host. He wrote and produced songs that were recorded by various singers, most notably [[Sharon Cuneta]]. He was a judge of the singing contest ''[[Sing Galing! (2021 game show)|Sing Galing!]]''. He was a former head judge of the singing contest segment "[[Tawag ng Tanghalan]]" in a variety noontime show ''[[It's Showtime (Philippine TV program)|It's Showtime]]''. He is the cousin of former Abra Governor Vicente P. Valera.

== Career ==
Valera started his recording career in 1977 after becoming a band member from a group called Electric Hair Band for seven years. He waxed his first single as a solo singer – songwriter with the song "Ako si Superman", which he wrote supposedly for [[Rico J. Puno]]. His former boss at [[Vicor Music|Vicor Records]] gave him the opportunity to sing his song and at the same time hired him as one of Vicor's in-house producers. Valera wrote the song "Mr. D.J." and "Kahit Maputi na ang Buhok Ko" for Sharon Cuneta as part of the album ''DJ's Pet'', released in 1978.

Valera also made songs for other artists such as Rico Puno's "Sorry Na, Pwede Ba", "Daigdig Ng Ala-ala"; Geraldine's "Pangako"; Pol Enriquez' "Ayoko na Sa 'Yo" and many more. While he made songs for his peers, he made albums for himself such as ''Naaalala Ka'', ''Rey Valera Vol. 2'', ''Walang Kapalit'', ''Hello'', ''The Rey Valera Christmas Album'', ''Gabay Mo Ako'', ''Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 1'', ''Rey Valera's Greatest Hits Vol. 2'', ''Pirapirasong Ala-ala'', ''Sa Kabila Ng Lahat'', ''Kung Sakaling Iibig Muli'', ''FM Ka, AM Ako'', ''Home Sweet Home'', ''Ang Mahalaga'', etc. Most of these albums made golds and platinums.

Recently, Vicor Music Corporation compiled Valera's recorded songs in their library in a 4-disc album entitled, ''Walang Kapalit'', as part of Vicor's 40th anniversary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/12/12/ENTR2004121224274.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071022093456/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2004/12/12/ENTR2004121224274.html |archive-date=22 October 2007 |title="Vicor celebrates 40 years of commitment to the Filipino artist" December 12, 2004 |publisher=MB.com.ph |date=22 October 2007 |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>

He was finally inducted to the Philippines Eastwood City Walk of Fame in 2009.

He won the MYX Magna Award 2015 in the recent 2015 MYX Music Awards.<ref name="myxmagna">{{Cite web|url=http://myxph.com/features/22973/here-are-the-winners-of-the-myxmusicawards-2015/ |title=Here Are The Winners Of The #MYXMusicAwards 2015! |publisher=[[Myx]] |date=27 March 2015 |access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref>

=== Mr. DJ and Sharon Cuneta ===
One of his initial projects as a request from [[Tito Sotto]] who was the vice president of the Vicor Music Corporation at that time was to make a song for a twelve-year-old mayor's daughter named Sharon Cuneta. It was a daunting challenge, as Rey initially could not figure out what kind song would be fitting for her; she was too young to be taken seriously to be given a love song, and a bit too old to be given a nursery rhyme.

"Pansin ko fleeting ang life, atsaka moment ka lang in time.

Kaya ma-swerte na lang ako meron akong konting laban sa time...

Hindi niya ako mabubura... May kanta ako eh"

TRANSLATED FROM TAGALOG

"I've noticed that life is fleeting, and we're just a moment in time.

I'm very lucky that I have something I can use against time...

"I have my songs with me...I will always be remembered"

| style="text-align: left;" | Rey Valera, quote from an interview on Balikbayan QTV-11, July 2008
|}

It dawned upon Rey to write a song about the people who were responsible for playing songs on the radio; the DJs. Wherever radio station the song would be submitted in, it was almost always guaranteed that it would be played as it was their song. The song, Mr. DJ, made remarkable sales on the chart.

Sharon stated in a recent interview by Deborah Kan in Star News Asia, that she has been always thankful for and grateful to Rey, for writing her first hit song. "Mr. DJ".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.startv.com/starnewsasia/view/talk/4028d8bb124b05e70112642178ad0024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927012021/http://www.startv.com/starnewsasia/view/talk/4028d8bb124b05e70112642178ad0024 |archive-date=27 September 2007 |title=Star News Asia, "Talk with Deborah Kan" |publisher=Startv.com |date=27 September 2007 |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>

The two have been friends ever since, and in 1992, Sharon paid tribute to her favorite composer when she recorded Sharon Sings Valera.<ref name="globalpinoy.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Rey%20Valera&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 |title=Pinoy Musicians, Rey Valera |publisher=Globalpinoy.com |access-date=25 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717025622/http://www.globalpinoy.com/ch/ch_category.php?category=pinoymusicians&name=Rey%20Valera&table=ch_pinoymusicians&startpage=16&endpage=30 |archive-date=17 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

When Sharon Cuneta and her then husband Gabby Concepcion separated, Rey composed the song, "Kahit Wala Ka Na" (Even When You're Gone). When Sharon and Rey met at Cinema Audio, she asked why he was not writing songs for her anymore. Rey replied that he did write one for her and submitted the song to VIVA for it to be an inspiration or a battleground for Sharon. Both of them found out that the song has been shelved for two years at VIVA. Sharon immediately recorded the song and used it in her movie, "Single Mother"(former title). It was retitled to "Kahit Wala Ka Na".<ref name="globalpinoy.com" />

Sharon's biggest blockbuster movies were lifted from popular songs of Rey, thus Sharon singing Valera has been an always-winning chemistry.

=== Rey Valera's impostor ===
In 1983, Rey faced one of the worst challenges of both his career, and personal life; an impostor was using his name and was committing crimes, among them were car-napping and rape.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/fake-valera.jpg |title=People's Journal January 26, 1983 "Fake Valera Alive & Kicking" |access-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024623/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/fake-valera.jpg |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref><ref name="webng1983">{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/reybolero.jpg |title=Artista Magazine February 12, 1983 "Will The Real Rey Valera Please Stand Up?" |access-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024737/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/reybolero.jpg |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref> The list even extended to marrying numerous women, and even petty crimes like "borrowing" money and personal items, all under Rey Valera's name.<ref name="webng1983" /> Rey made numerous newspaper statements announcing that there is an imposter posing as him. Rey also wrote and released a song entitled, "My Fans Are in Trouble" to warn his fans through the medium of music, with the lyrics depicting his helplessness to stop this impostor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/my-fans-are-in-trouble.jpg |title=Tik-a-tik Newspaper/Magazine March 3, 1983 "Help Me, My Fans Are in Trouble... – Rey Valera" |access-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024809/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/my-fans-are-in-trouble.jpg |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref> What Rey feared most was not the money, but the physical harm people the impostor had fooled might do to him. Ultimately in 1984, Rey decided to quit show business at the peak of his career to protect his fans and also to make up for the time he lost with his family during his fame. When Rey made a comeback in 1988, he wore his hair long so that his impostor (who had kinky hair), would have a harder time posing as him if the impostor ever resurfaced. The impostor has never been heard from ever since.

Valera now talks about the impostor topic on less serious, even humorous tone, to help forget the traumatic experience it had caused. Looking back, he even dubbed his impostor "Rey Bolero" (Rey the Deceiver / Smooth Talker) when he talks about it to his friends and interviews, which was also mentioned on the "Na-Scam Ka Na Ba" interview on the Filipino television channel QTV 11 which aired around September 2006.

==== Bubble Gang parody ====
In May 2008, a friendlier, funnier impostor had emerged on the Filipino television show ''[[Bubble Gang]]'', in the persona of comedian/[[parodist]] [[Michael V.]] He even used "Rey Bolero" as his screen name. A segment of the show featured Michael V. as Rey Bolero, singing Mas Tanga 'ko Sa'yo ( I'm Dumber Than You Are ) – A parody of one of Rey Valera's well known songs, Pangako Sa'yo ( I Promise To You ). His costume was even patterned after Rey Valera's late 1970s attire.

The idea proved to be a hit, and a second Rey Valera song was soon used on the same show and segment, also by Michael V. himself. The song, "Kung Kailangan Mo Ako" ( If You Need Me ), was parodied into Kung Kailangan Mo Bato ( If You Need A Stone / To Get Stoned—a slang use of the word "stone", as in [[Methamphetamine|illegal substance]] / [[Substance intoxication|getting high]] )

On 31 October of the same year, Rey Valera, and Michael V. as Rey Bolero ( now mimicking Rey Valera's clothes and hairstyle at the time) performed a duet and was one of the highlights of the heavily promoted, "taped as live", two-part Bubble Gang 13th Anniversary special. A narration was heard before the two artists entered the stage; "Do the singers that Michael V. impersonate ever get angry?" – (translated from Tagalog). They sang a medley of the two previously mentioned parodied songs. The segment ended with Rey Valera mock-swinging his guitar at Michael V., and the former mock-chasing the latter towards the backstage.

=== Theme songs for soap operas ===
Valera's songs are also favorite titles and theme songs of soap operas like ''Ula, Batang Gubat'' ("Malayo Pa Ang Umaga"), ''[[Sa Sandaling Kailangan Mo Ako]]'' ("Kung Kailangan Mo Ako"), ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'' ("Pangako"), from [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]].

Recently, Valera's song's have been revived as theme songs for soap operas. They are: [[Maging Sino Ka Man]] (which has spawned a second book, [[Maging Sino Ka Man: Ang Pagbabalik]]), [[Walang Kapalit]], [[Tayong Dalawa]] and [[Juan dela Cruz (TV series)|Juan Dela Cruz]] from [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]]. All of these [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] shows have turned into a massive hit, making them top-rating and be part of every Filipino's lives .

=== Writing music and songs for movies ===
Valera was film scoring movies during his singing career, but after the trouble his impostor has caused, Rey focused on his musical directing career. He particularly liked scoring music for action films, giving fight scenes and chase sequences fast paced, rock-themed music, which reflects his roots as a rock band member.

Rey's songs made marks also as theme songs and movie titles. These include several [[Sharon Cuneta]] movies such as ''Maging Sino Ka Man'', ''Pangako sa 'Yo'', ''Kahit Wala Ka Na'', ''Tayong Dalawa''; ''Sinasamba Kita'', ''Romansa'', ''Hiwalay''; ''Carnap King'', ''Barumbado'', and ''Baby Ama''; ''Pasong Tirad, The Gregorio del Pilar Story'', ''Tampisaw''.

There are very few people are aware that Rey wrote music for movies, even fewer are aware that he also wrote music for [[Motion picture rating system#Philippines|R-18]] "Bold" films.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0350188/fullcredits imdb.com, "Tampisaw" Original Music by Rey Valera]</ref> He accepted making music for movies and considered it an opportunity, as these projects usually pitted his songwriting skills to follow fresh and often unusual themes and topics, often deviating from pop love songs which he was usually typecast into.

The theme song "Ambon" (Raindrop) from the film ''Tampisaw'' emphasizes on the singer's hunger and deprivation of love, and that a single "raindrop" of love would be enough for her to live on.

The theme song "Nagpapanggap" (Pretending/Deceiving) from the film ''Kerida'' (''The Mistress'') depicts a person's awareness that her lover is only pretending to love her, and yet she has this pragmatic acceptance and is even thankful that she was loved, no matter how false that love may be.

The theme song "Sa Gitna ng Buhay Ko" (In The Middle of My Life) from the film ''Naglalayag'' (''Silent Passage'') follows the movie's theme of a middle-aged woman falling in love with a man half her age. The song relates to her life as the times of the day, asking questions such as, "why did love arrive at only NOON?"

=== The Greatest Hitmakers ===
In 2002, Rey reunited with his contemporaries [[Rico J. Puno]] and [[Hajji Alejandro]] in a series of concerts called "Greatest Hits", highlighting the music of their own time. They also launched a [[video CD|VCD]] recording of their concert.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kabayancentral.com/video/viva/cppvatghslatmm.html |title=The Greatest Hits Live (Rico-Rey-Hajji) |publisher=Kabayancentral.com |date=28 December 1998 |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref> [[Nonoy Zuñiga]] and [[Marco Sison]] joined the group in the following year. The group continues to perform both locally and internationally<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philippines.com.au/cgi-bin/netboard/netboardr.cgi?fid=634&cid=108&tid=4910&pg=1&sc=20&x=0 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725143744/http://www.philippines.com.au/cgi-bin/netboard/netboardr.cgi?fid=634&cid=108&tid=4910&pg=1&sc=20&x=0 |archive-date=25 July 2011 |title=Philippines.com.au – GREATEST HITS 5 (Rico, Hajji, Nonoy, Marco & Rey): Concert Review |publisher=Philippines.com.au |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/greatest-hitmakers-pechanga-june-1-2007.jpg |title=Pechanga Promotional Pamphlet June 2007 "The Greatest Hitmakers" |access-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207024934/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/greatest-hitmakers-pechanga-june-1-2007.jpg |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/greatest-hitmakers-portland-oregon-a-6-10-2007.jpg |title=Concert Poster "The Greatest Hitmakers Live in Portland Oregon" June 10, 2007" |access-date=25 July 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207025024/http://www3.webng.com/tagabayugo/RV%20Webpage/images/greatest-hitmakers-portland-oregon-a-6-10-2007.jpg |archive-date=7 February 2012 }}</ref>

Although they were formally named "The Greatest Hits", the group felt that using the name "The Greatest Hitmakers" was more proper, as the former referred to the 'songs' and not the group members themselves. The group has successfully performed even with the absence of one or two members, usually concentrating on a core trio group ( e.g. Rey, Hajji, Rico / Rey, Hajji, Marco / Rey, Rico, Marco ) and varies between concert to concert, depending on each member's availability. This flexibility of the group's roster combined with miscommunication with the each show's promoter and other reasons has often led to various names for the group such as "The Hitmakers", "The Greatest Hits", "The Great Hitmakers" "GH5", "GH4" and such.

=== Saling Ket ===
In July 2005, Rey Valera released the music album "Panghabangbuhay", with his children's band called "Saling Ket". Whenever possible, Rey has been performing with them in almost all of his performances and still continues to do so.<ref name="autogenerated2006">{{cite web|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/03/02/ENTR2006030257575.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090217065917/http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2006/03/02/ENTR2006030257575.html |archive-date=17 February 2009 |title=Manila Bulletin Online March 2, 2006 "Saling Ket, The Family That Sings Together" |date=17 February 2009 |access-date=25 July 2012}}</ref>
