'''No Use for a Name''' (sometimes abbreviated '''NUFAN''' or '''No Use''') was an American [[punk rock]] band from [[San Jose, California]], [[United States]]<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.fatwreck.com/band/index/9 |title=Bands: Fat Wreck Chords |website=Fatwreck.com |access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref> formed in 1986<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://chrisdodgesounds.blogspot.ca/2013/04/no-use-for-name-debut-7-1988.html|title=NO USE FOR A NAME – debut 7" – 1988|website=chrisdodgesounds.blogspot.ca|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://tonysly.org/index.php/early-no-use-for-a-name-the-beginning|title=Tony Sly Music Foundation|last=Dodge|first=Chris|website=tonysly.org|access-date=December 1, 2016}}</ref> by Chris Dodge ([[guitar]]), Steve Papoutsis ([[bass guitar]]) and Rory Koff ([[Drum kit|drums]]). The band's sound evolved considerably through its career, starting off as a Bay Area-influenced punk band, moving on to a much heavier metallic-tinted sound to finally taking on a much lighter brand of [[melodic hardcore|melodic punk]] as the years passed. The band's career ended in 2012 following [[Tony Sly]]'s death on July 31 of that year.

==History==
No Use For a Name was formed in 1986 by longtime friends Dodge, Papoutsis and Koff. The early rehearsals of the band had taken place at a warehouse in Sunnyvale owned by Koff's father, where they also came up with the name for the band. During this era, the band was fronted by Papoutsis' friend John Meyer. Initially a four piece, it later expanded to a six piece, adding as a co-vocalist Ramon Gras and a second guitarist Doug Judd. The band experienced many line up changes during this period. In 1987, Dodge left to play in another Bay Area punk band, [[Stikky]], while in summer that year, both Meyer and Judd left the band with Tony Sly replacing Judd on guitar. This line-up first appeared on [[Maximum RocknRoll]]'s 1987 ''Turn it Around'' compilation, with the song "Gang Way". In 1988, Gras fell out with the rest of the band and left before an important show at Gilman and a live appearance on the KFJC radio show. In a tight spot, the band asked the former guitarist Dodge, who before the formation of No Use had sung in other local bands, to rejoin as vocalist, which he agreed. This line-up of the band recorded two EPs; ''No Use For a Name'' on Woodpecker Records and ''Let 'em Out on'' on Slap A Ham Records. In 1989, Dodge left again which allowed Sly to take over vocals and songwriting.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

NUFAN's first album, ''[[Incognito (No Use for a Name album)|Incognito]]'', was released in 1991 by New Red Archives. It was the only album by the band recorded as a trio.<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Incognito|others=[[No Use For a Name]]|year=1990|type=Booklet|publisher=New Red Archives}}</ref> In 1991, Dodge rejoined on second guitar and they released their second album, ''[[Don't Miss the Train]]'', in 1992 before signing up with [[Fat Mike]]'s label [[Fat Wreck Chords]] in 1993. In late 1992, Dodge left the line-up,<ref name=":0" /> and was replaced by the guitarist Robin Pfefer, who took over on lead guitar so that Sly could step down to rhythm and concentrate on singing. No Use for a Name also released their first record on Fat Wreck Chords that year, ''[[The Daily Grind (EP)]]'', which turned out to be highly successful.

Ed Gregor replaced Pfefer on lead guitar soon after the release of ''The Daily Grind''. In 1995, after the release of ''[[Leche Con Carne]]'', their third full-length album, [[Chris Shiflett]] and [[Matt Riddle (musician)|Matt Riddle]] joined the band to play guitar and bass guitar, replacing Gregor and Papoutsis respectively. With the punk music breakthrough in 1994, No Use for a Name received a larger audience after releasing this album, thanks to their video for the song "Soulmate" which was played on the [[MTV]] show ''[[120 Minutes]]''. This was the first video from Fat Wreck Chords to appear on MTV. In 1997, after the success of ''[[Making Friends (album)|Making Friends]]'', the band toured the U.S., Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan.

After releasing ''[[More Betterness!]]'', Shiflett left the band in 1999 to join the successful [[Foo Fighters]], being replaced by Dave Nassie. Two years later, the band released a live album, ''[[Live in a Dive: No Use for a Name]]'' on Fat Wreck Chords and, in 2002, No Use for a Name released its sixth studio album, ''[[Hard Rock Bottom]]''.

The band released its eighth full-length studio album, ''[[Keep Them Confused]]'', on June 14, 2005. It takes a more political position than earlier releases. A greatest hits collection, ''[[All the Best Songs]]'', was released on July 10, 2007. A new fourteen song full-length studio album entitled ''[[The Feel Good Record of the Year]]'' was released on April 1, 2008. In 2009, when promoting the album in Europe, Nassie left the band to join the [[Bleeding Through]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/34124 |title=Dave Nassie confirms No Use For A Name departure |website=Punknews.org |access-date=November 29, 2013}}</ref> In August 2009, the band announced that Nassie had been replaced by [[Chris Rest]], [[Lagwagon]]'s guitarist and founding member of [[Rich Kids on LSD]].<ref>[http://shortscore.net/2009/08/22/lagwagon-ba-harapott-a-no-use-for-a-name/ Lagwagon-ba harapott a No Use for a Name] ShortScore.net (August 22, 2009.)</ref> In December 2010,  Koff told the band that he would need time off from touring to go full time with his snowplow business<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrag.com/2011/08/08/interview-no-use-for-a-name/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=January 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111202021819/http://www.thebrag.com/2011/08/08/interview-no-use-for-a-name/ |archive-date=December 2, 2011 }}</ref> and he was eventually replaced by a new full-time drummer, Boz Rivera (of King City, Rich Kids on LSD, and [[The Mad Caddies]]).<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
