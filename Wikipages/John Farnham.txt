===1964–67: The Mavericks to Strings Unlimited===
As Johnny Farnham he performed with local band The Mavericks on weekends, while still attending school, from 1964. The band had a five-song repertoire. In late 1965, he was asked to join band Strings Unlimited as lead singer; it was a band composed entirely of string-only instruments, and they had a regular booking at a local hotel.<ref name="ARDb"/><ref name="CountBio"/><ref name="Miles"/>

In 1966, after making the state finals of the [[Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds]], they recorded a three-track demo tape with Farnham on vocals, Stewart Male on lead guitar, Barry Roy on rhythm guitar, Mike Foenander on keyboards, Joe Cincotta on bass and Peter Foggie on drums.<ref name="FarnBio">{{cite web|url=http://www.johnfarnham.info/biography/biography.htm|title=John Farnham biography|website=johnfarnham.info|access-date=23 December 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126182540/http://www.johnfarnham.info/biography/biography.htm|archive-date=26 January 2009}}</ref>

On 29 April 1967, Strings Unlimited performed as a backing band for pop singer [[Bev Harrell]] in [[Cohuna, Victoria|Cohuna]].

===1967–79: Teen pop idol===
Farnham's first commercially successful recording was a cover of British [[novelty song]] "[[Sadie (The Cleaning Lady)]]"; Sambell had disliked it, as the lyrics were so persistent.<ref name="Jeff"/> However, [[EMI]]'s in-house producer, David MacKay, insisted, and so the single was released in November 1967.

At 22, Farnham was appointed '[[Moomba|King of Moomba]]' in 1972, with Melbourne paper ''The Sun'' describing him as a "likeable English migrant" who is "King of Pop, King of Kids and today Johnny Farnham was King of Moomba."<ref>{{cite book|last=Bellamy|first=Craig|author2=Gordon Chisholm|author3=Hilary Eriksen|date=17 February 2006|title=Moomba: A festival for the people|url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf|page=19|location=Melbourne, Vic|access-date=27 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305134140/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf|archive-date=5 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1972, Farnham had a top 5 national hit with a cover version of the title track from the [[David Cassidy]] international hit album, ''[[Rock Me Baby (album)|Rock Me Baby]]''.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Relations with Sambell became strained and in January 1976 they announced their split.<ref name="Jeff"/> Farnham first turned to Kenn Brodziak, producer of ''Pippin'', for his management during 1976–78, and then to Danny Finley, Hewett's then husband, from 1978.<ref name="Miles"/>

Farnham starred in a situation comedy series ''[[Bobby Dazzler]]'' as the title character during 1977–78, and narrated documentaries including ''Survival with Johnny Farnham''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|magazine=Filmink|url=https://www.filmink.com.au/australian-singers-turned-actors/|title=Australian Singers Turned Actors|date=14 July 2019}}</ref><ref name="McF"/><ref name="IMDb"/> Farnham was in financial trouble with unpaid taxes and the collapse of a restaurant venture with Hewett and Finley.<ref name="Miles"/> Farnham's singing career was now confined to the [[cabaret]] circuit and stage musicals.

===1980–85: Little River Band era===
Farnham had met [[Glenn Wheatley]], who was bass guitarist of 1960s rock group [[The Masters Apprentices]], when both acts were managed by Sambell.<ref name="Jeff"/> Wheatley was now managing [[Little River Band]] (LRB), and Farnham signed with Wheatley in 1980.<ref name="Jeff"/> They decided his comeback single would be a reworking of [[The Beatles]]' "[[Help!

In recording the album, Farnham's studio band were guitarist [[Tommy Emmanuel]] (ex-Southern Star Band), keyboardist Mal Logan (ex-[[Renée Geyer|Renée Geyer Band]], LRB), drummer Derek Pellicci (LRB) and bass guitarist Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain). They became his tour band until Logan and Pellicci returned to their LRB commitments and were replaced by Sam McNally and [[David Jones (drummer)|David Jones]], respectively.<ref name="McF"/> In 1980, Farnham also appeared in a TV series entitled ''Farnham and Byrne'' with former ''[[Young Talent Time]]'' teen star and '[[Australian pop music awards#1974|Queen of Pop]]' [[Debra Byrne]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="IMDb"/> Three other solo singles followed in 1981, but none of them charted into the top 50.<ref name="Kent"/>

In February 1982, after [[Glenn Shorrock]] had departed Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist after recommendations by Goble and Wheatley.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Miles"/> Farnham had initially resisted the idea of joining LRB, but Wheatley convinced him that Shorrock approved of the replacement.<ref name="Jeff"/> This continued Farnham's move away from [[cabaret]] and into rock music.<ref name="Toby"/>

With Farnham, Little River Band recorded three studio albums, which had modest success, but it was not enough to pay back the advances the record company had provided. The first studio album, ''[[The Net (album)|The Net]]'', was already written, and Farnham had no say in the songs; he just had to record his lead vocals. In the US, charting albums with Farnham's vocals included ''[[Greatest Hits (Little River Band album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (1982), ''The Net'' (1983), and ''[[Playing to Win]]'' (1984) on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard 200|Pop Albums chart]]/''Billboard'' 200.<ref name=AMGAlbums>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4766|pure_url=yes}}|title=Little River Band|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=28 December 2008}}</ref> While charting singles were, "[[The Other Guy (song)|The Other Guy]]", "We Two", "You're Driving Me Out of My Mind" and "Playing to Win".<ref name=AMGSingles>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4766|pure_url=yes}}|title=Little River Band> Charts & Awards> Billboard Singles|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=28 December 2008}}</ref> Farnham's biggest Australian hits with LRB were the 1982 single "Down on the Border" which peaked at No. 7 and ''The Net'' which peaked at No. 11 on the albums charts in 1983.<ref name="Kent"/>

During this time, Farnham started supplying vocal tracks for films, including ''Savage Streets'' (1984), ''The Slugger's Wife'' (1985), and ''Fletch'' (1985); he later continued with ''Rad'' (1986) and ''Voyage of the Rock Aliens'' (1987).<ref name="McF"/><ref name="IMDb"/> "Justice for One" was co-written by Farnham,<ref name="APRA Justice">{{cite web|publisher=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]]|title="Justice for One" at APRA search engine|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Justice%20for%20One|access-date=17 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126232705/http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Justice%20for%20One|archive-date=26 January 2009}}</ref><ref name="ASCAP">{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=1505417&search_in=c&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=20&start=1|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523065215/http://www.ascap.com/ace/search.cfm?requesttimeout=300&mode=results&searchstr=1505417&search_in=c&search_type=exact&search_det=t,s,w,p,b,v&results_pp=20&start=1|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 May 2011|title=American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|publisher=[[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers|ASCAP]]|access-date=27 December 2008}}</ref> for ''Savage Streets'' and it was released as a solo single.<ref name="McF"/>

Little River Band recorded a concert in Melbourne that aired in the United States on [[HBO]]. The concert video was only one hour long, and it highlighted some of the songs from ''The Net'' as well as reworked versions of Little River Band classics such as "Cool Change" and "Reminiscing". "Please Don't Ask Me", a song written by Goble,<ref name="APRA Please">{{cite web|publisher=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]]|title="Please Don't Ask Me" at APRA search engine|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Please%20Dont%20Ask%20Me|access-date=17 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725190858/http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Please%20Dont%20Ask%20Me|archive-date=25 July 2011}}</ref> and a non-top 50 single for Farnham almost three years previously,<ref name="Kent"/> was played during the "Australian-themed" opening of the show. Despite positive Australian and US reviews and responses, this performance has not yet been released on VHS or DVD.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

In an interview with [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]], Farnham stated: "I'll be better off leaving, rather than putting myself under pressure that I've created." Through this matter, it became apparent to the band that Farnham was intending on leaving and ''Playing to Win'''s lead single "[[Playing to Win]]", a song believed by all to be the band's return to success, then started having authorship disputes. According to Farnham:{{quote|["Playing to Win" was] about my frustration in the band, about wanting out, not wanting to be there any more. There was a bit of in-fighting and we were doing it hard on the road. That's what inspired the song.<ref name="Jeff"/>|John Farnham}}

As a result, Farnham's relationship with the band was further sullied. To date, the royalties for the song are meticulously divided with different shares to each of the song's contributors, including Goble, Farnham, Stephen Housden, [[David Hirschfelder]] and [[Wayne Nelson]].<ref name="APRA Playing">{{cite web|publisher=[[Australasian Performing Right Association]]|title="Playing to Win" at APRA search engine|url=http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Playing%20to%20Win|access-date=17 January 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126232806/http://www.apra-amcos.com.au/worksearch.axd?q=Playing%20to%20Win|archive-date=26 January 2009}}</ref> By late 1985, LRB were in conflict again and Farnham left.<ref name="McF"/> In mid-1986, Little River Band released the third studio album, ''[[No Reins]]'', but Farnham was already pursuing his solo career.<ref name="Jeff"/>

===1986–97: Peak solo years===
==="You're the Voice" and ''Whispering Jack''===
Farnham had started collecting a songlist for a future solo album while still in Little River Band. He finished his vocals for their album, ''No Reins'', and left in late 1985.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Jeff"/>

Farnham's first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with [[Brett Garsed]] on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar, Derek Pellicci on drums, Bruno Di Stanislo on electric bass and vocals. [[Sound engineer]] Ross Fraser suggested to Farnham's manager [[Glenn Wheatley]] that it was time to start working on the solo album. Wheatley searched vainly for a producer and record label willing to work with Farnham; Fraser took on the producer role, and Wheatley provided financial support after mortgaging his house.<ref name="Miles"/>

While visiting a jazz club in the US, Farnham was mistakenly introduced as Jack Phantom, and when he subsequently provided a running commentary for a local pool game he named himself ''Whispering Jack Phantom'' after the ''[[Pot Black]]'' commentator, "Whispering [[Ted Lowe]]".<ref name="Jeff"/> His work for the album, ''[[Whispering Jack]]'', included expanding his songlist with Fraser's advice.

Initially, public interest in the re-branded former teen-idol was difficult to cultivate, and radio stations refused to play Farnham's album. Things, however, started to change after Sydney radio station [[2Day FM]] played its first single, "[[You're the Voice]]", which was released in September 1986. Henceforth, radio stations began receiving requests for the song.

After the success of the album, Farnham followed with Jack's Back Tour; an initial itinerary of eleven performances was thought to be enough considering they were up against tours by [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Billy Joel]]; however, after high ticket sales, it was extended by eight more shows and made use of larger venues.
