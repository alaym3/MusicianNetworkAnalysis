'''The Breeders''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band based in [[Dayton, Ohio]], consisting of members [[Kim Deal]] (rhythm guitar, lead vocals), her twin sister [[Kelley Deal]] (lead guitar, vocals), [[Josephine Wiggs]] (bass guitar, vocals) and Jim Macpherson (drums).

The earliest incarnation of the band was formed by Kim Deal and [[Tanya Donelly]] in 1989 as a side-project alongside their full-time bands [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Throwing Muses]] respectively.  To record their debut album, 1990's ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'', Deal and Donelly recruited bassist Josephine Wiggs of [[The Perfect Disaster]] and drummer [[Britt Walford]] of [[Slint]].  Kim's sister Kelley was brought into the band as a third guitarist (though at the time, Kelley famously had never played guitar before joining the band) in 1992 to record the ''[[Safari (EP)|Safari]]'' EP, and shortly thereafter Tanya Donelly left to concentrate full-time on her own new band, [[Belly (band)|Belly]], leaving Kelley Deal as the sole lead guitarist, while Britt Walford left as well around the same time.  While the band's first record wasn't initially a commercial success, the band had developed a following among [[indie rock]] fans and praises from people such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]], who cited ''Pod'' as one of his all-time favorite albums,<ref>{{harvnb|Steve Albini Drops Anonymity, Answers Questions In Poker Forum}}</ref> the band prepared to record their next album.

In 1993, the Pixies broke up, leaving Deal to concentrate on The Breeders as her full-time band.  Kim recruited local [[Dayton, Ohio]] musician Jim Macpherson (previously a member of Dayton indie rock band The Raging Mantras) to replace the recently departed Walford on drums, cementing the Breeders' best-known line-up.  The band's most commercially successful album, ''[[Last Splash]]'', was released in 1993 in the midst of the early 1990s [[alternative rock]] boom. The album went on to be certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[RIAA]], and is best known for its hit single "[[Cannonball (The Breeders song)|Cannonball]]".<ref name="aaron">{{cite journal | last = Aaron | first = Charles | title = Ordinary People | journal = Spin | volume=9|issue= 12 | page = 82 | date = March 1994 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-GJOt0bM2-YC&pg=RA1-PA82}}</ref>

A year after the success of ''Last Splash'', drug and alcohol issues forced the band into hiatus in 1994, while both the Deal sisters did separate stints in rehab in the following years. During the band's hiatus, Kim Deal formed the short-lived alternative rock band [[The Amps]], recording a single album, ''[[Pacer (album)|Pacer]]'', in 1995. In the late 1990s, Kim and Kelley reformed The Breeders with a new line-up (including members of the band [[Fear (band)|Fear]]) and released two more albums, ''[[Title TK]]'' in 2002 and ''[[Mountain Battles]]'' in 2008. In 2013, Kim and Kelley had announced that the "classic" line-up (including [[Josephine Wiggs]] and Jim Macpherson) had reunited for the first time since the 1990s for a new series of tours celebrating the 20th anniversary of the band's hit album ''[[Last Splash]]''. They released their fifth album ''[[All Nerve]]'' in 2018, the "classic" Breeders line-up's first full-length album together since 1993's ''Last Splash''.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
[[File:Kim Deal Smoke.jpg|thumb|right|Lead singer [[Kim Deal]] performing with the band.]]
The Breeders' history began when Kim Deal, not fulfilled in her subordinate role as bassist of the Pixies,<ref name="Larkin 2011 p. 2006-IA782">{{cite book | last=Larkin | first=C. | title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music | publisher=Omnibus Press | year=2011 | isbn=978-0-85712-595-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=2831 | page=2831}}</ref> began writing new material while the Pixies were touring ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'' in Europe with [[Throwing Muses]]. As neither band had plans in the immediate future, Deal discussed possible side projects with Throwing Muses guitarist Tanya Donelly.<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=105}}</ref> They recruited [[Carrie Bradley]], violinist and vocalist in Boston band [[Ed's Redeeming Qualities]], and recorded a short demo tape. Tracks on the demo tape included early versions of "Lime House", "Doe", and "Only in 3's".<ref name="fg106">{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=106}}</ref>

With the help of three different drummers—[[David Narcizo]], [[Mickey Bones]], and Carl Haarer—and bassist Ray Halliday, Deal and Donelly completed their demo tape and subsequently played one show at [[The Rathskeller]] in Boston. They were not called The Breeders at this point, but were billed as "Boston Girl Super-Group".<ref name="fg106" /> The band sent the tape to the English [[independent record label]] [[4AD]] because both the Pixies and the Throwing Muses were signed to the label. Upon hearing the tape, 4AD head [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] remarked, "This is absolutely magical, beautiful stuff."<ref name="fg107">{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=107}}</ref> Deal originally described the band as "[[the Bangles]] from Hell".<ref name="DealinMico">Deal, Kim in {{harvnb|Mico|1990|pp=29–30}}</ref>

The name Breeders had previously been used for a band Deal led with her twin sister Kelley.<ref name="Larkin 2011 p. 2006-IA782" /> "[[wikt:breeder|Breeders]]", a gay slang term for heterosexuals, was chosen because Kim Deal found it humorous and also reflected her love of horror films, specifically referencing [[David Cronenberg]]'s 1979 film ''[[The Brood]]''.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Maron |first=Marc |title=Episode 863 - Kim Deal — WTF with Marc Maron Podcast |website=WTF with Marc Maron |publisher= |date=November 13, 2017 |time=1:11:20 |url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-863-kim-deal |access-date=July 21, 2021}}</ref>

=== ''Pod'' (1990–91) ===
{{Listen|filename=IrisTheBreeders.ogg|title="Iris"|description=Sample of "Iris," the eighth track on their first album ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]''.<!-- The song is an example of -->|format=[[Ogg]]}}
4AD gave Deal and Donelly a budget of $11,000 <ref>Spitz, Marc. "Life to the Pixies." ''Spin''. September 2004.</ref> to make an album. Deal asked [[The Perfect Disaster]]'s [[Josephine Wiggs]] to play bass. The two had first met when Perfect Disaster supported the Pixies in London in 1988. Deal asked [[Steve Albini]], who had worked on the Pixies' 1988 album ''[[Surfer Rosa]]'', to record the album. The Breeders did not have a drummer, so Albini suggested [[Britt Walford]] of [[Slint]]. Walford agreed to play on the album under the pseudonym "Shannon Doughton".<ref name="4adbreeders">{{cite web | url=http://4ad.com/breeders/profile/ | title=The Breeders | access-date=2007-09-07 | publisher=4AD | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202023833/http://www.4ad.com/breeders/profile/ | archive-date=2008-12-02 }}</ref>

A week of rehearsal took place at Wiggs's house in [[Bedfordshire]], England, and ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'' was recorded in ten days in [[Edinburgh, Scotland]].<ref name="fg107" /> They used the remaining time to record a [[Peel Session]] and a video for "Hellbound."<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=108}}</ref> Returning to London, they played two shows, the only time that this lineup ever appeared onstage together. Released on 28 May 1990,<ref name="4adbreeders" /> ''Pod,'' although not commercially successful, received positive reviews from alternative and mainstream critics alike; ''[[The New York Times]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki> Karen Schoemer wrote: "The angular melodies, shattered tempos, and screeching dynamics recall elements of each of the women's full-time bands, but ''Pod'' has a smart, innovative edge all its own."<ref>{{cite news | author=Schoemer, Karen | date = July 8, 1990| title= Recent Releases | newspaper=The New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/07/08/arts/home-entertainment-recordings-recent-releases.html | access-date= 2007-11-22}}</ref> The album was also famously cited by [[Kurt Cobain]] as one of his favorite records ever: "The main reason I like [the Breeders] is for their songs, for the way they structure them, which is totally unique, very atmospheric. I wish Kim was allowed to write more songs for the Pixies, because '[[Gigantic (song)|Gigantic]]' is the best Pixies song, and Kim wrote it."<ref>''[[Melody Maker]]'', "Kurt Cobain of Nirvana Talks About the Records That Changed His Life".

=== ''Safari'' and ''Last Splash'' (1992–94) ===
Following ''Pod'', the members of The Breeders returned to their original bands.<!-- other projects? --> The Pixies released ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]]'' in 1990 and ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' in 1991, but by the end of 1991 were becoming less active. Deal, with time off from the Pixies, visited Wiggs in Brighton, and they went into a London studio with [[Spacemen 3]]/[[Spiritualized]] drummer [[Jon Mattock]] to record a new song called "Safari." The other three tracks on what became the ''[[Safari (EP)|Safari]]'' EP were recorded in New York with Walford and Donelly, who was by then planning to form [[Belly (band)|Belly]].<ref>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=109}}</ref> Deal then asked her sister Kelley to take over on guitar, even though, famously, Kelley did not know how to play guitar. The Pixies became inactive in mid-1992, at which time drummer Jim Macpherson was recruited and The Breeders became a full-time band,<ref name="4adbreeders" /> opening for [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] on their 1992 European tour.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3770|pure_url=yes}} | title=The Breeders > Biography | access-date=2007-09-15 |author1=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas |author2=Phares, Heather | website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref>

In January 1993, The Breeders went to Coast Recorders in San Francisco to record their second album. ''[[Last Splash]]'' was released in August 1993 to widespread acclaim and commercial success. Three singles were released from the album, including "Cannonball", which made it to no.&nbsp;2 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine | url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the breeders|chart=all}} | title=Artist Chart History&nbsp;— The Breeders | access-date=2007-07-31 | magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The band contributed a live recording of the song "Iris" to the 1993 AIDS-Benefit Album [[No Alternative]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. In 1993, they toured supporting Nirvana on their ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' tour, and in 1994, ''Last Splash'' received a platinum [[RIAA certification|certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Also in 1994, the band secured a prime spot on the [[Lollapalooza]] tour.<ref name="allmusic" /> This lineup played their last show together on September 5, 1994, at Lollapalooza in Los Angeles, California.

=== Hiatus ===
In 1995, Kelley was involved in a drug bust, which put The Breeders on an indefinite hiatus. Kim formed a side project, [[The Amps]], with Macpherson, Dayton locals bassist Luis Lerma (member of The Tasties) and guitarist Nate Farley, who later joined [[Guided by Voices]]. In October 1995, The Amps released the album ''[[Pacer (album)|Pacer]]''.

Following drug rehab, Kelley started [[The Kelley Deal 6000]], also forming [[The Last Hard Men (band)|The Last Hard Men]] with [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]] singer [[Sebastian Bach]], [[Smashing Pumpkins]] drummer [[Jimmy Chamberlin]], and [[Jimmy Flemion]] of [[The Frogs (band)|The Frogs]].

Meanwhile, in New York, Wiggs recorded and co-produced the [[Kostars]]' album ''Klassics with a K'', a [[Luscious Jackson]] side-project (also touring with them playing drums), released a solo album on the [[Beastie Boys]]' [[Grand Royal]] label, and released an album on Atlantic Records under the name [[Dusty Trails]] with [[Luscious Jackson]] keyboardist [[Vivian Trimble]].

In 1996, Kim reclaimed The Breeders moniker, but with essentially The Amps' lineup plus violinist [[Carrie Bradley]], and played a few California dates. They made an unsuccessful attempt at recording a third studio album in 1997. Kelley Deal rejoined the band the following year and wrote and recorded songs with her sister, although the only material released during this period was a cover of The Three Degrees' take on James Gang's "Collage", recorded for ''[[The Mod Squad (film)|The Mod Squad]]'' soundtrack in 1999.<ref name="allmusic" />

=== ''Title TK'' (2001–02) ===
The Deal sisters recruited new personnel to play several live shows in 2001, and returned to the studio with guitarist Richard Presley, bass player Mando Lopez, and drummer [[Jose Medeles]] to record the third Breeders studio album, ''[[Title TK]]'', with [[Steve Albini]]. This lineup was profiled in a short documentary film entitled ''The Breeders: The Real Deal'' (Netherlands, 2002).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alarm.com.mk/eng_cinema.html |title=ALARM Festival |publisher=Alarm.com.mk |access-date=2012-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426060653/http://www.alarm.com.mk/eng_cinema.html |archive-date=2012-04-26 }}</ref>

The Breeders also performed in an episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' in early 2002. They were approached by the production staff after they had been playing the show's theme, written by [[Nerf Herder]], as a regular part of their concert set. The episode is entitled "[[Him (Buffy episode)|Him]]", and aired November 5, 2002; they sang their song "Little Fury" at the Bronze. They also contributed the track "Wicked Little Town: Hedwig Version" to the 2003 ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (film)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]'' tribute album, "[[Wig in a Box]]".

=== ''Mountain Battles'' and ''Fate to Fatal'' (2008–10) ===

''[[Mountain Battles]]'' was released in April 2008 on [[4AD]]. It features Kim and Kelley, Jose Medeles, and Mando Lopez. They went to Refraze Recording Studio in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio to record and mix the majority of the tracks.

The title track was recorded at The Fortress Studios, London, by [[The Go! Team]] producer [[Gareth Parton]]. The music video featured the [[Arch Rival Roller Girls]], a [[St. Louis]] [[roller derby]] league.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Breeders Cover Bob Marley, Recruit Mark Lanegan for April 21st EP "Fate to Fatal"|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-breeders-cover-bob-marley-recruit-mark-lanegan-for-april-21st-ep-fate-to-fatal-20090316|access-date=14 April 2011|newspaper=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=16 March 2009}}</ref>

In a June 2016 article, [[Stereogum]] reported that the band was in their Ohio studio recording a follow up to ''Mountain Battles'', and that [[Courtney Barnett]], who was in town for the [[Nelsonville Music Festival]], recorded some backup vocals for one of the album's songs.<ref name="Stereogum">{{cite web | url=http://www.stereogum.com/1880859/courtney-barnett-will-appear-on-new-breeders-album/news/ | title=Courtney Barnett Will Appear On New Breeders Album | access-date=2016-09-25 | publisher=[[Stereogum]]| date=2016-06-03 }}</ref>

A single, "[[Wait in the Car]]", was released on October 3, 2017, and is part of an upcoming seven-inch series to be issued by 4AD. The song will be available on three different seven-inch records, limited to only 1,500 copies. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described the song as "a classic Breeders bruiser, clocking it at two minutes, and packed with punchy drums, sugar-rush power chords, and lead riffs".<ref name="RS">{{cite magazine | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/hear-the-breeders-new-razor-edged-rocker-wait-in-the-car-w506824 | title=Hear the Breeders' New Razor-Edged Rock Song 'Wait In the Car' | access-date=2017-10-06 | magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]| date=2017-10-03 }}</ref> During a [[BBC]] interview with [[Lauren Laverne]] on October 13, 2017, Kim revealed that the band expected to release a new album in 2018, possibly on the 4AD label.
