'''Madvillain''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo consisting of two [[Rapping|MC]]s and [[Record producer|producer]]s, [[MF Doom]] and [[Madlib]]. Their debut album ''[[Madvillainy]]'' was met with wide critical acclaim for its unique approach. Their short songs, obscure lyrics, and lack of choruses made for a sound that was generally unfriendly to commercial radio, but was lauded as a key aspect of their identity as an [[underground hip hop|underground]] act.

== History ==
In 2006, Madvillain was featured on [[Stones Throw Records]] and [[Adult Swim]]'s DVD/CD ''[[Chrome Children]]'' with a new song and live performance. [[Kidrobot]] followed this by announcing a Madvillain action figure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2007/01/madvillain-kid-robot |title=Madvillain Figure by Kid Robot & Stones Throw &#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |date=2007-01-15 |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>

Madvillain's label [[Stones Throw]] announced in 2009 that [[MF Doom]] and [[Madlib]] were currently working on a second Madvillain album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/madvillain/ |title=Madvillain &#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>

On May 26, 2010, Madvillain released the song "[[Papermill (song)|Papermill]]" via [[Adult Swim]]'s website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2010/05/madvillain-papermill |title=Madvillain - Papermill &#124; MP3 Download &#124; Stones Throw Records |publisher=Stonesthrow.com |date=2010-05-26 |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> On January 3, 2011, Madvillain released the songs "Avalanche" and a remix of the Doomstarks song "Victory Laps" via Stones Throw mixtape.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stones Throw Podcast 64: Stones Throw 2011 mixed by PB Wolf |url=https://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2011/01/stones-throw-podcast-64 |website=[[Stones Throw Records|Stones Throw]] |access-date=11 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106012257/https://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2011/01/stones-throw-podcast-64 |archive-date=6 January 2011 |date=3 January 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In late 2011, during an interview at the Red Bull Music Academy in Madrid, MF Doom admitted that the second Madvillain album had been nearly done for about two years and that it should be out "soon", sometime after MF Doom finishes his part on it in "say, January" 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/doom_lecture?template=RBMA_Lecture%2Ftranscript |title=DOOM |publisher=Red Bull Music Academy |date=2011-12-09 |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>

On September 6, 2012, MF Doom co-hosted [[Benji B]]'s late night [[BBC Radio 1]] show. As well as talking about the origins of Madvillain and what it was like to work with Madlib, he announced during the show that he just had to "touch up a couple of tracks" on the new Madvillain album and said that it should be out by the end of 2012, depending on when [[Stones Throw]] choose to release it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00y8qmn |title=BBC Radio 1 - Benji B, MF DOOM Takeover, MF DOOM's Benji B Takeover |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-09-06 |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>

On January 9, 2014, Madlib stated in a ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed & Confused]]'' interview that it is up to MF Doom to decide on whether he wants to finish the second Madvillain album, and that he does not have to. "It’s not close to finished because it has to be a continuation of the last one. It doesn't have to be better or worse but it has to be a continuation."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/18062/1/a-rare-encounter-with-madlib |title=A rare encounter with Madlib &#124; Dazed |publisher=Dazeddigital.com |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref>
