The band's recorded music and videos are produced by member and multi-instrumentalist Gianni "Luminati" Nicassio.

==History==
Walk off the Earth was formed in 2006 in [[Burlington, Ontario]], Canada. The band began releasing music independently and created a variety of cover versions of songs including [[The Gregory Brothers]]. In early 2012, the band's live cover of [[Gotye]]'s "[[Somebody That I Used to Know]]" on YouTube gathered over 175 million views in a mere four months,<ref name="Noise11">{{cite news|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/gotye-cover-inspires-russell-crowe-to-pitch-to-walk-off-the-earth-20120109|title=Gotye Cover Inspires Russell Crowe To Pitch To Walk Off The Earth|last=Cashmere|first=Paul|date=January 9, 2012|work=Noise11|access-date=January 9, 2012}}</ref> receiving positive reviews from both Gotye and his co-singer on the song, [[Kimbra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/gotye/status/155487374992879616|title=Twitter post by Gotye|access-date=January 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Noise11-2">{{cite news|url=http://www.noise11.com/news/kimbraimpressed-with-gotye-cover-by-walk-off-the-earth-20120108|title=Kimbra Impressed With Gotye Cover By Walk off the Earth|last=Cashmere|first=Paul|date=January 8, 2012|work=Noise11|access-date=January 8, 2012}}</ref> The band released an accompanying video in which all five members are shown playing on the same guitar simultaneously. The production was taken from the 26th cut of a 14-hour session. [[Ellen DeGeneres]] featured the band on her January 23, 2012, show where they played live, again on one guitar; the group was also included in YouTube Rewind 2012 "Rewind YouTube Style 2012", doing a part of its one guitar acoustic version of "[[Gangnam Style]]".

In February 2012, the band signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records]].<ref name="Crazed Hits"/> The members appeared in the Season 4 premiere of CTV's ''[[The Listener (TV series)|The Listener]]'', performing two songs and socializing with the main characters in the bar. They also covered "[[Rude (MAGIC! song)|Rude]]" by [[Magic!]], "[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]" by [[Adele]], "[[Party Rock Anthem]]" by [[LMFAO (group)|LMFAO]], "[[Payphone (song)|Payphone]]" by [[Maroon 5]], and "[[Roll Up (Wiz Khalifa song)|Roll Up]]" by [[Wiz Khalifa]].<ref name="ctvedmonton">{{cite web|url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/ont-band-walk-off-the-earth-has-viral-youtube-hit-1.753322|title=Ont. band Walk Off the Earth has viral YouTube hit|last=CTV Edmonton|date=January 13, 2012|work=CTV News|publisher=[[BellMedia]] |access-date=January 14, 2012}}</ref><ref name="plester">{{cite news | last = Lester | first = Paul | title = Walk Off the Earth (No 1,500) | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] (online) | location = United Kingdom | publisher = Guardian News and Media | date = April 25, 2013 | url =https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/apr/25/walk-off-the-earth | access-date =January 2, 2014}}</ref>

At this time, singer Sarah Blackwood, who had joined the band in late 2011, was also the singer and guitarist for fellow Ontario based band [[The Creepshow]]. The Creepshow had announced a tour of Europe and North America for the late summer - including dates in the United Kingdom in August.  However, Walk Off The Earth soon announced a tour of their own with conflicting dates, and on July 16, Blackwood uploaded a farewell video to her YouTube page, announcing she was leaving The Creepshow.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jo81eVRzgbU|title=My farewell to The Creepshow fans :)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=18 January 2013}}</ref>  Blackwood went on to join Walk Off The Earth on a permanent basis, starting with their Autumn tour and EP, ''[[R.E.V.O.]]''. The Creepshow's next album, ''[[Life After Death (The Creepshow album)|Life After Death]]'', appeared to hint that the departure was acrimonious, with lyrics of the song ''Take It Away'' including the line: "You picked our pockets then you left us for broke/Now you're just somebody that I used to know".

In December 2012, Walk off the Earth released an original single titled "Gang of Rhythm". The group uploaded a cover of [[Taylor Swift]]'s "[[I Knew You Were Trouble]]" to YouTube in January 2013, with four of the five band members and guest beatboxer KRNFX using only vocals.<ref name="Metro Lyrics">{{cite news|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/blog/2013/01/03/walk-off-the-earths-i-knew-you-were-trouble-cover-goes-viral|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106111227/http://www.metrolyrics.com/blog/2013/01/03/walk-off-the-earths-i-knew-you-were-trouble-cover-goes-viral/|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 6, 2013|title=Walk off the Earth's 'I Knew You Were Trouble' Cover Goes Viral|work=Metro Lyrics|access-date=January 1, 2013}}</ref>

They began another US and Europe tour, Gang of Rhythm, in 2014. The most recent tour was the Sing It All Away tour through Europe and North America, which began in 2015. The band's YouTube video of [[Lorde]]'s "[[Royals (song)|Royals]]" was featured in the [[2014 Grammy Awards]]. The band's original single "Gang of Rhythm" was chosen as the theme song for the Catalan TV show ''El Foraster''. The group was also featured on the soundtrack of the 2015 animated film ''[[Snowtime!]]'', performing the song "You're My Sweater".
