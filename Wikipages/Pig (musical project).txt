'''Raymond Watts''' (also known by his former stage names Nainz, Nainz Watts and Ray Scaballero) is an English musician, the founding and sole member of the [[industrial music]] project '''PIG''', sometimes written as '''&lt;PIG>'''.

Watts was an early member and periodic collaborator of [[KMFDM]], and has been a visible part of the industrial music scene since the early 1980s. He has toured with KMFDM, [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Schaft]], [[Schwein]], and [[Einstürzende Neubauten]].

==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2016|section=}}

=== Recent activity (2010–present) ===
Watts, Dr. Shinto and John Gosling released a four-song EP titled ''Mellan Rummen'' on 15 November 2010 on [[Amazon.com]].

On 8 June 2012 [[Marc Heal]] revealed a demo version of "the first new PIG track in eight years" entitled "Drugzilla (Rough As A Hog's Arse Mix)" via [[Cubanate]]'s Official [[Facebook]] page and providing their followers a link to his personal [[SoundCloud]] page. The link was reposted by Watts a few hours later.<ref name=Fabryka8June2012>{{cite web|author=NiNa|title=''06/08/2012 Pig - "Drugzilla" unofficial mix available online''|url=http://industrialrock.net/php-files_en/news.php?readmore=315|publisher=Fabryka Industrial Rock Magazine|access-date=8 June 2012|date=8 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=ReGen8June2012>{{cite web|title=''PIG unveils a rough mix of first new track in eight years''|url=http://regenmag.com/news/pig-unveils-a-rough-mix-of-first-new-track-in-eight-years/|publisher=ReGen Magazine|access-date=8 June 2012|author=Yücel, Ilker (Ilker81x)|date=8 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=COMA8June2012>{{cite web|title='':Music News: New rough mix of a new PIG track.''|url=http://coma-online.com/?p=15430|publisher=COMA Music Magazine|access-date=8 June 2012|author=COMA Music Magazine|date=8 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=MarcHealFB8June2012>{{cite web|title=''And so, ladies and gentlemen, I present you…''|url=https://facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=288504897913134&id=181903017655|publisher=Official [[Cubanate]] on [[Facebook]]|access-date=8 June 2012|author=Heal, Marc|author-link=Marc Heal|date=8 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=RaymondWattsFB8June2012>{{cite web|title=''Rough mix of new PIG track "Drugzilla".''|url=https://facebook.com/theswining/posts/191052334354988|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121129112602/https://facebook.com/theswining/posts/191052334354988|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 November 2012|publisher=Official PIG on [[Facebook]]|access-date=8 June 2012|author=Watts, Raymond|author-link=Raymond Watts|date=8 June 2012}}</ref><ref name=MarcHealSC8June2012>{{cite web|title=''Pig - Drugzilla (Rough As A Hog's Arse Mix)''|url=http://soundcloud.com/marc-heal/drugzilla-marc-heal-rough-as-a#new-timed-comment-at-127560|publisher=Official [[Marc Heal]] on [[SoundCloud]]|access-date=8 June 2012|author=Heal, Marc|author-link=Marc Heal|date=8 June 2012}}</ref> A second demo entitled ''Shake'' was released on 15 July 2012; again via Heal's Soundcloud page, this time also noting Dan Abela as engineer.<ref name=MarcHealSC15June2012>{{cite web|title=''Pig - Shake (Rough Mix)''|url=http://soundcloud.com/marc-heal/shake|publisher=Official [[Marc Heal]] on [[SoundCloud]]|access-date=17 June 2012|author=Heal, Marc|author-link=Marc Heal|date=15 June 2012}}</ref> In November 2014 Watts approved mixes for an upcoming joint-release EP.<ref name="EP news">{{cite web|title=Cubanate (Facebook) - Spoke to Watts on the phone... |url=https://www.facebook.com/cubanate/posts/10153251905917656 |website=Facebook.com|access-date=18 November 2014 |date=4 November 2014}}</ref>

In March 2015 another collaborative EP was announced with [[Primitive Race]] entitled "[[Long in the Tooth (Primitive Race EP)|Long in the Tooth]]" with a worldwide release date of 5 June 2015 through [[Metropolis Records]].<ref name=PrimitiveRace>{{cite web|title=Long in the Tooth |url=http://www.metropolis-mailorder.com/product.php?prodnum=MET+981 |access-date=11 March 2015 |website=Metropolis-mailorder.com|date=9 March 2015}}</ref> Later that month in an interview, Watts revealed a new PIG album has been written and recorded.

On 15 June 2016, the official PIG Facebook page announced that the new PIG album (called The Gospel) would be released on 9 September 2016 on Metropolis. Soon after tour dates were announced The American Excess tour with opening bands En Esch & Peter Turns Pirate.  The North American tour takes place in September and October 2016. A remix album, 'Swine & Punishment' was released in 2017.

In 2018, PIG released the album 'Risen', supported by another North American tour. 2019 saw the release of a collection of cover songs on an LP titled 'Candy'. The release of 'Candy' was followed in the fall of the same year by the Divine Descent North American Tour, supported by Cyanotic and A Primitive Evolution. The Divine Descent Tour concluded on 6 October 2019 in Minneapolis, Minnesota. A brief tour of the United Kingdom followed.

In 2020, PIG released a compilation album, 'Pain Is God', which featured some new tracks, and included songs from prior tour EPs dating back to the previous year. The album was released digitally, and on CD and vinyl, including special edition packages with unique 3D features in the digipack or record sleeve.

==Musical style==
PIG tends to sound more orchestral than KMFDM, with darker, more complex, more [[ambient music|ambient]] beats.  His album and song titles tend to be witty, rife with [[alliteration]] ("Prayer Praise & Profit") or are plays on the titles of popular works or phrases (''[[The Swining]]'' / "Symphony for the Devil"). He also manages to work food, heroin or pork related terms into his albums. Like KMFDM, humor features prominently in PIG's lyrics, although they tend towards a darker/grittier tone than KMFDM's.

==Collaboration with KMFDM==
Because Raymond Watts is a central figure in both PIG and KMFDM, the two projects have seen much crossover.  Watts has contributed his skills as a songwriter and vocalist to several KMFDM albums, including their first album ''[[Opium (KMFDM album)|Opium]]'' in 1984, and has a heavy presence on their 1995 album ''[[Nihil]]'', which spawned the hit "[[Juke Joint Jezebel]]". A collaborative EP titled ''[[Sin Sex & Salvation]]'' was released in 1994 under the moniker "PIG vs. KMFDM". KMFDM has in turn assisted Watts with his PIG projects in production and personnel.  Current KMFDM guitarists [[Steve White (guitarist)|Steve White]] and [[Jules Hodgson]] (as well as former KMFDM guitarist [[Günter Schulz]])
and drummer [[Andy Selway]] have been involved with PIG.  Watts has performed with KMFDM as part of the touring lineup, with the concerts billed as "KMFDM featuring PIG". The setlists for those shows feature KMFDM songs alongside Pig songs. A live CD from the 2002 "Sturm & Drang" tour was released on [[Metropolis Records]] that same year.

Watts was given a tongue-in-cheek description in the lyrics to the KMFDM song "Intro" from the 2003 album ''[[WWIII (album)|WWIII]]'':

{{poemquote|
The Lord of Lard, the Mighty Swine
He loves [[Manchego cheese|Manchego]] and a bottle of wine
Also known as Raymond Watts,
He screams out his lungs while his brain slowly rots!
}}

==Other collaborations==
Watts has worked with several [[industrial music|industrial]] and [[avant-garde]] artists, receiving credits as PIG and Raymond Watts interchangeably.  He has also been credited as "Nainz Watts" or "Nains Watts" on several early releases.
