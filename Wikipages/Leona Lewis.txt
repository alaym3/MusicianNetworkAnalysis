She was born and raised in the [[Islington|London Borough of Islington]], and she attended the [[BRIT School]] for Performing Arts and Technology in Croydon. Lewis achieved national recognition when she won the [[The X Factor (British series 3)|third series]] of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2006, winning a [[pound sterling|£]]1 million recording contract with  [[Syco Music]]. Her winner's single, a cover of [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s "[[A Moment Like This]]", peaked at number one for four weeks on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and broke a world record by reaching 50,000 digital downloads within 30 minutes. In February 2007, Lewis signed a five-album contract in the United States with [[Clive Davis]]'s record label, [[J Records]].

Lewis's success continued with the release of her debut studio album, ''[[Spirit (Leona Lewis album)|Spirit]]'' (2007), which was certified 10× platinum in the UK and became [[List of best-selling albums of the 2000s (decade) in the United Kingdom|the fourth best-selling album of the 2000s]] and one of the [[List of best-selling albums in the United Kingdom|best-selling albums in UK chart history]]. According to the [[Official Charts Company]], ''Spirit'' is the best-selling debut album by a female artist in the 21st century. The lead single, "[[Bleeding Love]]", spent seven weeks at number one in the UK and was the [[List of best-selling singles by year in the United Kingdom|best-selling single of 2007]]. In the US, it was the best-selling single of 2008 and Lewis was proclaimed Best New Artist by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' the same year. In 2009, she released her second studio album, ''[[Echo (Leona Lewis album)|Echo]],'' and recorded the [[I See You (Theme from Avatar)|theme song, "I See You"]], for the film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]''.

In 2011, Lewis released the single "[[Collide (Leona Lewis and Avicii song)|Collide]]", a collaboration with Swedish DJ [[Avicii]], and her debut [[extended play]], ''[[Hurt: The EP]]''. Her third studio album, ''[[Glassheart]]'' (2012), marked a new creative direction for Lewis, drawing inspiration from [[dubstep]] and [[electronic music]]. She began to record material for her first Christmas album during her [[Glassheart Tour]], which took place in mid 2013. ''[[Christmas, with Love]]'' was released later that year and its lead single, "[[One More Sleep]]", peaked at number three in the UK. With this chart entry, Lewis became the first British female solo artist to reach the top five with eight singles, surpassing [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s record of seven. 

In 2014, she made her film debut in ''[[Walking on Sunshine (film)|Walking on Sunshine]],'' and her fourth studio album, ''[[I Am (Leona Lewis album)|I Am]]'', was released the following year. In 2016, Lewis made her [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] debut as [[Grizabella]] in the revival of [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s musical ''[[Cats (musical)|Cats]],'' and the following year, she signed a modelling contract with [[Wilhelmina Models]]. She then collaborated with [[Calum Scott]] on the single "[[You Are the Reason (Calum Scott song)|You Are The Reason]]" (2018), and had a recurring role on the American television series ''[[The Oath (U.S. TV series)|The Oath]]'' (2019).
