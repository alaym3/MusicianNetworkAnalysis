==Early life==

Faulkner is the second child of Sally Carolyn (née Battenberg, formerly Evans) and Keith William Faulkner. He has an older brother, Toby William Battenberg Faulkner and a younger sister, Charlotte (Lottie) Elizabeth Battenberg Faulkner. Faulkner attended [[the Hawthorns School]] in [[Bletchingley]], Surrey. He began playing guitar at the age of 13 (after a few attempts at the [[Drum kit|drums]] and [[piano]]) and attended the [[Italia Conti Academy of Theatre Arts]]. He grew his trademark red [[dreadlocks]] at age 15. He then moved on to the [[Academy of Contemporary Music]] in [[Guildford]] in 2002, where he spent two years gaining both diploma and the higher diploma award under the tutelage of [[Eric Roche]], amongst others.

His first band was a [[Green Day]] cover band, in which he played bass guitar. His experience on the stage grew as he formed 'Half A Guy', a funk rock group, with bandmates Matt Buchanan (credited in Newton's ''Hand Built by Robots'' tab book), Dave Elvy and Nicola Crawshaw. 'Half A Guy' recorded two demo CDs and lasted two years before splitting. He then spent time recording and playing gigs under the name Newton Battenberg Faulkner, including the Lapagestock festival on 11 June 2005.

==Music career==

=== ''Hand Built by Robots'' (2005–2008) ===
In 2005, he made a song for the game 'TrackMania Sunrise' called ''Take Back''.

Faulkner made appearances in 2006 on [[BBC Radio 2]] and he secured a Publishing deal with Peermusic UK who asked the ''[[Independent on Sunday]]'' to tell its readers to "watch this face".<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=Independent on Sunday (London) |date=8 January 2006 |page=19; Features | title=Watch this face: Newton Faulkner}}</ref> Faulkner performed at the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] music festival and at [http://www.guilfest.co.uk/index.php Guilfest] 2007.

He subsequently signed with [[Sony BMG]] records and in July 2007 he released his début album ''[[Hand Built By Robots]]''. He supported [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]] on his February UK tour, [[Paolo Nutini]] on his UK tour in April, and [[John Mayer]] on his September dates in the UK. He also supported [[The John Butler Trio]] on a number of European dates.

In 2007, Faulkner's debut studio album ''[[Hand Built by Robots]]'' was certified double platinum in the United Kingdom. ''[[Hand Built By Robots]]'' made No.1 in the UK Album Chart in August 2007. He released three singles from the album, "[[Dream Catch Me]]", "[[I Need Something]]" and "Teardrop". "[[Dream Catch Me]]" was selected [[Jo Whiley]]'s ''Pet Sound'' on her daily [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show and made No.7 on the UK Singles Charts.  This gave the track exposure and was highly commented on by listeners to Jo's show by SMS and e-mail.  On 29 July, "Dream Catch Me" reached No. 7 in the  [[UK Singles Chart]].
His fourth single from the album, a cover of [[Massive Attack]]'s "[[Teardrop (song)#Newton Faulkner|Teardrop]]", was released in December 2007. A new video for "[[I Need Something]]" was released in March along with a United States version of the video for "[[Dream Catch Me]]".

Faulkner has performed at several major UK summer music festivals. In 2007 and 2008 he played at [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[V Festival]], [[Connect Music Festival]] 2007, at [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]] 2008, [[Lollapalooza]] 2008 in Grant Park [[Chicago]], [[Oxegen 2008|Oxegen]] in [[Ireland]] and at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 2008]].<ref>[https://archive.today/20081207130513/http://news.jamradio.org/newton-faulkner-at-bonnaroo-2008.php Newton Faulkner at Bonnaroo 2008] ''news.jamradio.org'', 24 March 2008 (Retrieved: 24 March 2008)</ref>

=== ''Rebuilt by Humans'' (2009–2011) ===

Faulkner released his second studio album, ''[[Rebuilt by Humans]]'', in 2009, which made No.3 [[UK Albums Chart]].
On a video blog streamed live from Newton Faulkner's website on 22 June 2009, he stated that the new album would be called ''Rebuilt By Humans''.  The reason for this was that in December 2008, Faulkner slipped on some ice and badly injured his wrist, into which doctors fitted a metal plate. He then said that effectively, he had "been put back together again by humans".
The first single from the album was "If This Is It", with the video exclusively shown on Channel 4 and released in September 2009.

In 2009 Faulkner played at [[Latitude]] Festival, [[Cois Fharraige (festival)|Cois Fharraige]] in the Republic of Ireland, and at the [[Crossing Border Festival]] in the [[Netherlands]], which was his last performance for the ''Rebuilt By Humans'' launch tour.

In 2010, "Dream Catch Me" was featured in the US film, ''[[She's Out of My League]]''. In early 2010, Faulkner featured on the [[Hamish and Andy]] radio show in Australia, playing "I Hate Mondays" and this song charted at No.1 on the Australian Apple [[iTunes Store]]. Faulkner again performed at several UK festivals - [[Glastonbury Festival]] 2010, [[Oxegen 2010|Oxegen]] [[Ireland]], [[T in the Park]] 2010 in [[Scotland]], [[Latitude]] Festival 2010, and the Beautiful Days music festival in Devon. In October 2010, he played a surprise set at the ACM Awards show at Indig02 at the [[The O2 Arena (London)|O2 Arena]] in [[London]] and in November 2010, he appeared at the 'Christmas Lights switch-on' in [[Barnstaple]].

Faulkner took part in the 2010-2011 [[Edinburgh]] New Year's [[Hogmanay]] Celebration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edinburghshogmanay.org/content/Edinburgh's-Hogmanay-Street-Party/3728 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726015411/http://www.edinburghshogmanay.org/content/edinburgh%27s-hogmanay-street-party/3728/ |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=Edinburgh's Hogmanay 2011- The World's Best New Year Celebrations! |publisher=edinburghshogmanay.org |access-date=2013-08-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 2011 he played at "Movistar Summer Experience" in Pinamar, [[Argentina]] in February and at the 'Beach Break Live' in Wales. Faulkner headlined the 'Avebury Rocks Charity Concert' in July 2011 and this event raised money for a Cancer Charity the [[Love Hope Strength]] Foundation.
In July 2011 he played at the [[Cambridge Folk Festival]]. In 2011 Faulkner performed at the Bath Forum as a part of the 'International Guitar Foundation'.

In 2011, a portrait of Faulkner painted by British artist [[Joe Simpson (artist)|Joe Simpson]] was exhibited around the UK including a solo exhibition at [[The Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>NME [http://www.nme.com/photos/musician-portraits---joe-simpsons-paintings-of-rock-stars/249522/1/1 "Musician Portraits - Joe Simpson's paintings of rock stars"] "2011"</ref>

Also in 2011, his track "Over and Out" was covered by the Irish vocal pop group [[Westlife]] and was included in the band's second major compilation album and twelfth major overall album ''[[Greatest Hits (Westlife album)|Greatest Hits]]''.

=== ''Sketches'' and ''Write It on Your Skin'' (2012–2013) ===

An EP named ''Sketches'' was released on 17 April 2012 and contained three new tracks. It was taken off iTunes on 21 April 2012,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtonfaulkner.com/au/news/2012-04-21/ep_update/|title=EP Update|publisher=newtonfaulkner.com|access-date=4 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714145209/http://www.newtonfaulkner.com/au/news/2012-04-21/ep_update/|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and was updated and re-released on 21 May 2012.

At several shows on his 2012 tour, Faulkner announced that his third studio album would be titled ''[[Write It on Your Skin]]'', and a track called "Clouds" would be the album's first single.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newtonfaulkner.com/au/news/2012-06-01/write_it_on_your_skin_tracklisting_revealed/|title=Write It on Your Skin tracklisting revealed|publisher=newtonfaulkner.com|access-date=4 June 2012|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130130062433/http://www.newtonfaulkner.com/au/news/2012-06-01/write_it_on_your_skin_tracklisting_revealed/|archive-date=30 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In June 2012, "Clouds" received [[BBC Radio 1]] airplay.

The recording of Faulkner's fourth album ''[[Studio Zoo]]'' was being streamed live online, [[24/7]] for five weeks from 11 June 2013, with regular updates on the social networks. His home studio in East London was set up with four cameras, to follow every detail of recording the album..

<blockquote>I am as excited as I am terrified by the prospect of having a house full of cameras film me while trying to record an album. The entire recording process will be streamed live and nothing has been recorded in advance - apart from some particularly good hand claps recorded in Paris.  The album will be made before your very eyes, no tricks, no producer and no engineer, just me, a guitar and a few surprise guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/newton-faulkner-new-album-studio-zoo-out-on-august-26th-2013-plus-recording-to-be-filmed-24 |title=Newton Faulkner New Album 'Studio Zoo' Out On August 26th 2013 Plus Recording To Be Filmed 24/7 In His East London Home |publisher=[[Contactmusic.com]] |access-date=5 August 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

He played "Dream Catch Me", "I Need Something", "Brick by Brick", "Orange Skies" and a cover of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]", among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Newton-Faulkner/10489/Live-music.html|title=Newton Faulkner: Live music|work=[[Absolute Radio]]|access-date=5 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829225220/http://www.absoluteradio.co.uk/player/Newton-Faulkner/10489/Live-music.html|archive-date=29 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The album ''Studio Zoo'' was released on 26 August 2013. It debuted at no. 10 at UK Albums Chart, becoming Faulkner's fourth top 10 studio album.

=== ''Human Love'' (2015) ===
On 15 September 2015, it was announced that Faulkner's fifth studio album, ''[[Human Love]]'', would be released on 20 November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/193794/9|title=Newton Faulkner Confirms November Release For 'Human Love' And UK Tour - Stereoboard|first=Huw|last=Baines}}</ref> A music video for the album's lead single,<ref>{{Citation|last=NewtonFaulknerVEVO|title=Newton Faulkner - Get Free (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JLK02Fgyn4|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref> a cover of [[Major Lazer]]'s song "[[Get Free (Major Lazer song)|Get Free]]", was released the same day and featured a live take of Newton cutting off the long dreadlocks that had been a part of his instantly recognisable image since his teens. A second single, "Up Up and Away", was subsequently released and accompanied by a video featuring choreographed dance routines performed while Newton jogged along a river bank.<ref>{{Citation|last=NewtonFaulknerVEVO|title=Newton Faulkner - Up Up And Away (Official Video)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFL9zP8vck|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>

=== ''Hit the Ground Running'' (2017) ===
Newton's sixth studio album was released on 1 September 2017.  While this built on the intricate guitar and percussive guitar work that was a feature of his previous albums, it marked a conscious focus from Newton to push his vocal range to the limits with a strong emphasis also on rhythm, most noticeably on the first, eponymous, single which featured some very high notes and also on another blues-tinged track "Finger Tip", which was released as the third single and the follow up to "All She Needs". As this recording marked the 10th anniversary of Newton's debut album ''Hand Built by Robots'', Hit The Ground Running featured several deliberate references to that record; the opening track "Smoked Ice Cream" (a track that he had played live for years that had no title until a suggestion was shouted out from a crowd at a gig<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/newton-faulkner-new-album-hit-the-ground-running-stream-buy-tour-dates-track-by-track-a7924661.html|title=Newton Faulkner pens track-by-track for new album Hit The Ground Running|date=2017-09-01|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref>) featured a slowly picked melody building into a rhythmic instrumental played on a single acoustic guitar before the vocals kick in, in a similar way to the instrumental "Intro", which builds on and then segues into "To the Light" at the start of his debut album. The placement of the only instrumental track "Guitar-y Thing" in the middle of ''Hit the Ground Running'' is also a nod to "Sitar-Y-Thing", which was an instrumental giving a similar mood to split ''Hand Built by Robots'' into two halves. Shortly before the release of Hit The Ground Running, Newton recorded an acoustic version of the full ''Hand Built by Robots'' album as a free gift for his fans, putting it out on YouTube as a video album featuring a newly recorded video of him playing each song in a different setting in and around his house<ref>{{Citation|last=Newton Faulkner|title=Newton Faulkner - 10 Year Anniversary vid of Hand Built By Robots|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Dwqqgi9Ir0|access-date=11 December 2018}}</ref> with each song seguing into the next in the same way and in the same order as the original record.
