'''Kakkmaddafakka''' is a Norwegian indie rock band formed and based in [[Bergen]]. They are known for their high energy live performances.

The band is one of many artists who emerged from Bergen, which the Norwegian press has called the "New [[Bergen Wave]]", as it is reminiscent of the many successful bands that emerged from Bergen in the late 1990s and the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nrkp3.no/den-nye-boelgen/ |title=Den nye bølgen? &#124; NRK P3 |publisher=Nrkp3.no |date=1 September 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2009}}</ref>

==History==
The band was formed by brothers Axel and Pål Vindenes, together with school friends Jonas Nielsen and Stian Sævig. All classically trained musicians, the band was formed to play a one-off show at a local youth centre, Ungdomshuset 1880, but after positive response the band continued to play many live shows around Norway. In 2006, the band made their first recording and released the EP ''Already Your Favourite EP'' which was produced by [[Matias Tellez]].

Kakkmaddafakka released its first LP ''Down to Earth'' on 24 September 2007, which reached number twenty on the VG Topp30 Album list<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lista.vg.no/show_list.php?ListsOp=showWeek&week=40&year=2007&listID=15 |title=Topp30 Album Norsk uke 40, 2007 - VG-lista.
