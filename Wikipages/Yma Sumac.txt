She was one of the most famous exponents of [[exotica]] music during the 1950s.

Sumac became an international success based on her extreme [[vocal range]]. She had five [[octave]]s according to some reports,<ref>[[David Richards (writer)|David Richards]], [https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1987/03/02/the-trill-of-a-lifetime/564bded7-e17a-4aba-80b5-716613033f37 "The Trill of a Lifetime"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'' (p.

In one live recording of "Chuncho", she sings a range of over four and a half octaves, from B<sub>2</sub> to G{{music|#}}<sub>7</sub>. She was able to sing notes in the low [[baritone]] register as well as notes above the range of an ordinary soprano. Both low and high extremes can be heard in the song "Chuncho (The Forest Creatures)" (1953). She was also apparently able to sing in a remarkable "double voice".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wfmu.org/listen.ram?show=5311&archive=4634 |title=''Secret Museum of the Air,'' October 6, 2002 program (5:15–5:57) |publisher=[[WFMU]]|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

In 1954, composer and music critic [[Virgil Thomson]] described Sumac's voice as "very low and warm, very high and birdlike", noting that her range "is very close to five octaves, but is in no way inhuman or outlandish in sound."<ref name="NYT obit"/> In 2012, audio recording restoration expert John H. Haley favorably compared Sumac's tone to opera singers [[Isabella Colbran]], [[Maria Malibran]], and [[Pauline Viardot]]. He described Sumac's voice as not having the "bright penetrating peal of a true coloratura soprano", but having in its place "an alluring sweet darkness ... virtually unique in our time."<ref name=Haley>{{cite journal |first=John H. |last=Haley |title=A Re-evaluation of the artistry of Yma Sumac Based on Live Recordings |journal=ARSC Journal |publisher=Association for Recorded Sound Collections |volume=43 |number=2 |pages=163–95 |date=Fall 2012}}</ref>  

==Early life==
Sumac was born Zoila Augusta Emperatriz Chávarri del Castillo on September 10, 1922,<ref name="petitionfornaturalization"/><ref name="Ancestry Library Edition"/> in [[Ichocán District|Ichocán]], a historically indigenous village in [[Cajamarca, Peru]]. Her parents were Sixto Chávarri and Emilia del Castillo. Her father was born in [[Cajamarca]] and her mother was born in [[Pallasca]], both mestizos. Stories published in the 1950s claimed that she was an [[Inca]]n princess, directly descended from [[Atahualpa]]. The government of Peru in 1946 formally supported her claim to be descended from Atahualpa, the last Incan emperor.<ref name="NYT obit">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/04/arts/music/04sumac.html?_r=0|title=Yma Sumac, Vocalist of the Exotic, Dies at 86|last=Martin|first=Douglas|date=November 4, 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=September 14, 2019}}</ref> However, her biographer, Nicholas E. Limansky, claims that her Incan royal origin was not true. "Hollywood took this nice girl who wanted to be a folk singer, dressed her up and said she was a princess. And she acted like it," according to Limansky.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-03-23|title=On the trail of Yma Sumac: The exotica legend came from Peru, but her career was all Hollywood|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/miranda/la-et-cam-yma-sumac-exotica-los-angeles-20170323-htmlstory.html|access-date=2021-01-16|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref> She was the youngest of six children. Her mother was a schoolteacher and her father a civic leader.<ref name="Yma">Yma Sumac [exotica vocalist]: Musician Snapshots Volume 3 of The Music You Should Hear Series by Stone Blue Editors, SBE Media, 2015.</ref>

She adopted the stage name of Imma Sumack (also spelled Yma Sumack and Ima Sumack) before leaving South America for the United States. Her stage name was based on her mother's name, which was derived from "ima shumaq", [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for "how beautiful!", although in interviews at the beginning of her career she claimed it meant "beautiful flower" or "beautiful girl".<ref>Cusihuaman 2001: pp. 47, 103</ref>

==Career==
Sumac first appeared on radio in 1942. She recorded at least 18 tracks<ref name="sunvirgin">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunvirgin.com/?Argentina|title=Argentina Session 1943|website=SunVirgin.com|access-date=September 13, 2016}}</ref> of Peruvian folk songs in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina in 1943. These early recordings for the [[Odeon Records|Odeon]] label featured composer Moisés Vivanco's troupe ''Compañía Peruana de Arte'', of 16 Peruvian dancers, singers, and musicians.<ref name="vivanco"/>

She married Moisés Vivanco on June 6, 1942.<ref name="vivanco">{{cite web|url=http://www.sunvirgin.com/?PageID=163 |title=Moisés Vivanco |access-date=May 18, 2017 |website=SunVirgin.com}}</ref> After this date, Moisés and Yma toured South America and Mexico as a group of fourteen musicians called Imma Sumack and the Conjunto Folklorico Peruano.  Some people in Peru did not appreciate her style of singing, most notably the writer Jose Maria Arguedas (La Prensa, 1944). In 1946, Sumac and Vivanco moved to [[New York City]] where they performed as the Inka Taqui Trio, Sumac singing [[soprano]], Vivanco on guitar, and her cousin, Cholita Rivero, singing [[contralto]] and dancing. The group was unable to attain any success; however, their participation in the South American Music Festival in [[Carnegie Hall]] was reviewed positively. In 1949, Yma gave birth to their only child Carlos.<ref name="Yma"/> She was discovered by [[Les Baxter]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=Mondo Exotica: Sounds, Visions, Obsessions of the Cocktail Generation|last=Adinolfi|first=Francesco|date=2008|publisher=Duke University Press|isbn=9780822341321|location=Durham|page=51|translator-last=Pinkus|translator-first=Karen|oclc=179838406|translator-last2=Vivrette|translator-first2=Jason}}</ref> and signed by [[Capitol Records]] in 1950, at which time her stage name became Yma Sumac. Her first album, ''[[Voice of the Xtabay]]'', launched a period of fame that included performances at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] and Carnegie Hall.<ref>[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&gws_rd=ssl&q=source:life+Yma+Sumac Yma Sumac, August 8, 1950. Malibu, Hollywood Bowl, Recording Studio, Residence (90 photos by Peter Stackpole)] for [[Life (magazine)|''Life'' magazine]]</ref>

In 1950, she made her first tour to Europe and Africa, and debuted at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London and the [[Royal Festival Hall]] before the future [[Elizabeth II|Queen of England]]. She presented more than 80 concerts in London and 16 concerts in Paris. A second tour took her to the Far East: Persia, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Burma, Thailand, Sumatra, the Philippines, and Australia. Her fame in countries like Greece, Israel and Russia made her change her two-week stay to six months. During the 1950s, she produced a series of best-selling  recordings of [[lounge music]] featuring [[Hollywood]]-style arrangements of Incan and South American folk songs, working with [[Les Baxter]] and [[Billy May]]. The combination of her extraordinary voice, exotic looks, and stage personality made her a hit with American audiences. Sumac appeared in a [[Broadway theater|Broadway]] musical, ''[[Flahooley]]'', in 1951, as a foreign princess who brings [[Aladdin]]'s lamp to an American toy factory to have it repaired. The show's score was by [[Sammy Fain]] and [[Yip Harburg]], but her three numbers were the work of Vivanco, with one co-written by Vivanco and Fain. ''Flahooley'' closed quickly, but the Capitol recording of the show continues to sell well as a cult classic, in part because it also marked the Broadway debut of [[Barbara Cook]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Yma-Sumac-Flahooley/release/6556083|title=Yma Sumac – Flahooley (Vinyl, Album)|website=Discogs.com|access-date=November 10, 2017}}</ref>

The 1950s were the years of  Sumac's greatest  popularity; She played [[Carnegie Hall]], the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] with [[Danny Kaye]], [[Las Vegas]] nightclubs and concert tours of South America and Europe. She put out a number of hit albums for Capitol Records, such as [[Mambo! (Yma Sumac album)|''Mambo!'']] (1954) and ''Fuego del Ande'' (1959).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Yma-Sumac-Fuego-Del-Ande/master/60469|title=Yma Sumac - Fuego Del Ande|website=Discogs.com}}</ref>  During the height of Sumac's popularity, she appeared in the films ''[[Secret of the Incas]]'' (1954) with [[Charlton Heston]] and Robert Young, and ''[[Omar Khayyam (film)|Omar Khayyam]]'' (1957).<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838512/|title=Yma Sumac|website=IMDb.com|access-date=July 23, 2021}}</ref>

She became a U.S. citizen on July 22, 1955. In 1959, she performed [[Jorge Bravo de Rueda]]'s classic song "Vírgenes del Sol" on her album ''Fuego del Ande''. In 1957 Sumac and Vivanco divorced, after Vivanco sired twins with another woman. They remarried that same year, but a second divorce followed in 1965. Apparently due to financial difficulties, Sumac and the original Inka Taky Trio went on a world tour in 1960, which lasted for five years. They performed in 40 cities in the [[Soviet Union]] for over six months, and a film was shot recording some moments of the tour,<ref>
Soviet Internationalism after Stalin by Tobias Rupprecht, Cambridge University Press, 2015, {{ISBN|9781107102880}}, p. 88</ref> and afterward throughout Europe, Asia and Latin America. Their performance in [[Bucharest|Bucharest, Romania]], was recorded as the album ''Recital'', her only live in concert record. Sumac spent the rest of the 1960s performing sporadically.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhyiR972AgE|title=Yma Sumac--1987 TV Interview, Linda Dano, Nancy Glass|last=Alan Eichler|date=February 2, 2016|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

== Vocal range ==
Sumac had a wide vocal register; she could emit notes from above a coloratura soprano to the low notes of a bass and had one of the widest vocal ranges. She was able to emit notes from the ''[[tessitura]]'' of sopranino, soprano, mezzo-soprano, contralto, tenor, baritone and bass, and was the only person able to do the triple coloratura or the trill of the birds. Her singing voice ranged from B<sub>2</sub> to G{{music|#}}<sub>7</sub>.

One source claims that in the song "K'arawi", she reached D<sub>8</sub> (at 00:26). If true this would extend her vocal range to over five octaves, perhaps even six.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dYZS1QXeQM0|title=K´arawi|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

In the song "Chuncho" she sang from B<sub>2</sub> (at 0:40) to C{{music|sharp}}<sub>7</sub> (at 2:56).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1KprLT-JxPY|title=Chuncho|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

In this live performance of "Supay Taki", she performs a duet with the flute that attains E<sub>6</sub>.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZwtiyJfq1_M|title=Live Duet|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 28, 2019}}</ref>

==Later career==
{{More citations needed|section|date=October 2019}}
In 1971, Sumac released a [[Rock music|rock]] album, ''Miracles''. She performed in concert from time to time during the 1970s in Peru and later in New York at the Chateau Madrid and [[Town Hall]]. In the 1980s, she resumed her career under the management of [[Alan Eichler]] and had a number of concerts both in the United States and abroad, including the [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel|Hollywood Roosevelt Cinegrill]], New York's Ballroom in 1987<ref name="Larkin50">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Fifties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2002|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-937-0|page=427}}</ref> (where she was held over for seven weeks to SRO crowds) and several [[San Francisco]] shows at the Theatre on the Square among others.

In 1987, she recorded "I Wonder" from the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] film ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' for ''[[Stay Awake: Various Interpretations of Music from Vintage Disney Films|Stay Awake]]'', an album of songs from [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]] movies, produced by [[Hal Willner]]. She sang "Ataypura" during a March 19, 1987, appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]''. She recorded a new German "techno" dance record, "Mambo ConFusion".

In 1989, she sang again at the Ballroom in New York and returned to Europe for the first time in 30 years to headline the [[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroeporganisatie|BRT]]'s "Gala van de Gouden Bertjes" New Year's Eve TV special in [[Brussels]] as well as the "Etoile Palace" program in Paris hosted by [[Frederic Mitterrand]]. In March 1990, she played the role of Heidi in [[Stephen Sondheim]]'s ''[[Follies]]'', in [[Long Beach, California]], her first attempt at serious theater since ''Flahooley'' in 1951.

She also gave several concerts in the summer of 1996 in [[San Francisco]] and Hollywood as well as two more in [[Montreal]], Canada, in July 1997 as part of the [[Montreal International Jazz Festival]]. In 1992, she declined to appear in a documentary for German television entitled ''Yma Sumac – Hollywoods Inkaprinzessin'' (''Yma Sumac – Hollywood's Inca Princess'').<ref name="Larkin50"/> With the resurgence of [[lounge music]] in the late 1990s, Sumac's profile rose again when the song "Ataypura" was featured in the [[Coen Brothers]] film ''[[The Big Lebowski]]''.<ref name="auto"/>

Her song "Bo Mambo" appeared in a commercial for [[Kahlúa]] liquor and was sampled for the song "Hands Up" by [[The Black Eyed Peas]]. The song "Gopher Mambo" was used in the films ''[[Ordinary Decent Criminal]]'', ''[[Happy, Texas (film)|Happy Texas]]'', ''[[Spy Games]]'', and ''[[Confessions of a Dangerous Mind (film)|Confessions of a Dangerous Mind]]'', among others. "Gopher Mambo" was used in an act of the Cirque Du Soleil show ''[[Quidam]]'', as a musical motif in the Russian show ''[[Kitchen (TV series)|Kukhnya]]''(along with "Bo Mambo" and "Taki Rari"), and in an iPhone commercial in 2020. The songs "Goomba Boomba" and "Malambo No.&nbsp;1" appeared in ''[[Death to Smoochy]]''. A sample from "Malambo No.1" was used in Robin Thicke's "Everything I Can't Have". Sumac is also mentioned in the lyrics of the 1980s song "[[Joe le taxi]]" by [[Vanessa Paradis]], and her album ''Mambo!'' is the record that [[Belinda Carlisle]] pulls out of its jacket in the video for "Mad About You".<ref>{{YouTube|XmdtJWmR9zQ}}</ref> 

On May 6, 2006, Sumac flew to [[Lima, Peru|Lima]], where she was presented the ''[[Order of the Sun (Peru)|Orden del Sol]]'' award by Peruvian President [[Alejandro Toledo]] and the [[Jorge Basadre]] medal by the [[Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos]].<ref>[http://www.sunvirgin.com/?NewsID=166 "Yma Sumac Receives Highest Peruvian Honor"], Sunvirgin.com; accessed October 14, 2015.</ref>
