'''The Avett Brothers''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|eɪ|v|ᵻ|t}} are an American [[folk rock]] band from [[Concord, North Carolina]].<ref name=":2" /> The band is made up of two brothers, [[Scott Avett]] ([[banjo]], lead vocals, guitar, piano, kick-drum) and [[Seth Avett]] ([[guitar]], lead vocals, piano, hi-hat) along with Bob Crawford ([[double bass]], electric bass, violin, backing vocals) and Joe Kwon ([[cello]], backing vocals). [[Mike Marsh (musician)|Mike Marsh]] ([[drums]]), Tania Elizabeth (fiddle) and Bonnie Avett-Rini (piano) are touring members of the band.

Following on from Seth and Scott's former rock band Nemo, The Avett Brothers combine [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[country music|country]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[Pop music|pop]] melodies, [[folk music|folk]], [[rock and roll]], [[indie rock]], [[honky tonk]], and [[ragtime]] to produce a novel sound described by the ''San Francisco Chronicle'' as having the "heavy sadness of [[Townes Van Zandt]], the light pop concision of [[Buddy Holly]], the tuneful jangle of [[the Beatles]], the raw energy of the [[Ramones]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=Avett Brothers Honor North Carolina Roots, but Look Forward |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/08/09/NS8LRB02C.DTL |date=August 9, 2007 |access-date=January 2, 2010 | first=Derk | last=Richardson}}</ref>

==History==

===Beginnings (2000-2002)===
Scott and Seth Avett have played music together since childhood as their grandmother was a concert pianist and their father Jim Avett was a guitarist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/local/community/cabarrus/article9043226.html|title=Music of the Avetts: Scott, Seth - and Jim|work=charlotteobserver|access-date=2018-07-22|language=en}}</ref> Their collaborative partnership began in the late 1990s with the merger of Seth's [[Mount Pleasant High School (North Carolina)|Mount Pleasant High School]] rock band Margo and Scott's college group Nemo. Margo had released the song "Dumbfight" on a compilation album before merging with Nemo. After releasing three albums with Nemo, the Avetts started experimenting with acoustic music with some friends at night.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url = http://folkthisblog.wordpress.com/2012-05-11/from-nemo-to-avett/|title = From Nemo to Avett|date = May 11, 2012|access-date =May 31, 2014|publisher = FolkThisBlog.com }}</ref> After a few street performances and parties they performed under the names The Back Porch Project or Nemo Downstairs. The brothers and Nemo guitarist John Twomey put together an EP entitled ''The Avett Bros'' in 2000 while performing both as the Avett Brothers (with Scott, Seth and John) and as Nemo.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url = http://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/magazine/forward-motion|title = For the Avett Brothers, Progress Means Looking Back and Slowing Down|date = 2010|access-date = June 2, 2014|publisher = FretboardJournal.com|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140605051253/http://www.fretboardjournal.com/features/magazine/forward-motion|archive-date = June 5, 2014|df = mdy-all}}</ref>

When Nemo broke up Scott and Seth continued to write acoustic music together. In early 2001 the stand-up bassist Bob Crawford, formerly of the Memphis Quick 50, joined the Avetts, and the band released their first full-length album, ''Country Was''.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.scnow.com/entertainment/article_15611b69-384f-58d0-bf9f-d96bfacb2b16.html|title = The Avett Brothers: From Nemo Back Porch Project at Parties to Three-Night Run at HOB|date = August 6, 2010|access-date = November 25, 2014|publisher = SCNow.com}}</ref> The Avett Brothers set out on a self-booked tour to promote the new album and in late 2002 began preparations for a follow-up.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.axs.com/the-avett-brothers-wow-audiences-fans-and-critics-with-their-infectiou-11267|title = The Avett Brothers Wow Audiences, Fans and Critics with Their Infectious Sets|date = May 27, 2014|publisher = AXS.com}}</ref>
