==Biography==
George Clanton was born in [[Ridgeway, Virginia]].<ref name="Bigstream">{{Cite podcast |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQrJ6tUhye8&t |title=BIG STREAM VR #49: CELEBRATING 100 YEARS OF VAPORWAVE |website=BIG STREAM |publisher=[[YouTube]] |host=Kane, Adam; Clanton, George; Negative Gemini |date=2021-02-12 |access-date=2021-03-25}}</ref><ref name="Richmond">{{Cite web |title=Name Your Price: September’s Best Bandcamp Releases |url=https://www.factmag.com/2015/10/02/name-your-price-septembers-best-bandcamp-releases/2/ |last=Bowe |first=Miles |date=2015-10-02 |website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |access-date=2020-06-12}}</ref> He grew up going to [[punk rock]] shows. His career began when he accidentally downloaded a misnamed [[Brian Jonestown Massacre]] song, which led him down an Internet rabbit hole where he discovered "a whole new world of music" which inspired him to write and release his own under the pseudonym Mirror Kisses, and later ESPRIT 空想. He decided to start using his real name before releasing his album ''[[100% Electronica]]'', because "[he] didn't want to release one more album as Mirror Kisses", and he "hated saying 'Mirror Kisses' every time someone asked [him his] band name."<ref name="id"/><ref name="PopGun">{{Cite web |title=Childhood Dreams, Nostalgia, and 100% Electronicon with George Clanton |url=https://www.popgunpresents.com/artist-features/childhood-dreams-nostalgia-and-100-electronicon-with-george-clanton/ |last=Korolev |first=Jake |date=July 25, 2019 |website=[[PopGun Presents]] |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref> He tried to make a sequel to ''100% Electronica'' for three years but felt that he failed, because he wasn't able to find the sound he wanted for it. After giving up, he started experimenting and writing stuff for fun and felt that the "songs [were writing] themselves". Eventually, this material transformed into his next album, ''[[Slide (George Clanton album)|Slide]]'', where he incorporated electric guitar and acoustic drums as well.<ref name="id"/>

In 2015 he established his record label 100% Electronica along with his girlfriend, fellow musical artist Negative Gemini. He and Negative Gemini both hail from Virginia and played their first show together in 2011 along with other artists such as [[Skylar Spence]]. In 2019, they launched 100% Electronicon, the first vaporwave music festival.<ref name="Flood_100%">{{Cite web |title=The Loudest Voices in the Chatroom: The Story of 100% Electronica |url=http://floodmagazine.com/69953/the-loudest-voices-in-the-chatroom-the-story-of-100-electronica/ |last=Gagnon |first=Tim |date=October 16, 2019 |website=Flood Magazine |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Stereogum">{{Cite web |title=Vaporwave Finally Makes An IRL Connection at 100% ElectroniCON |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2056934/100-percent-electronicon-george-clanton-vaporwave-review/franchises/sounding-board/ |last=Bowe |first=Miles |date=September 3, 2019 |website=[[Stereogum]] |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref>

==Songwriting and style==
George Clanton's music has been described as a fusion of [[electropop]], [[trip hop]], and vaporwave,<ref name="PopGun"/> while also using elements of [[grunge]], [[acid house]], and [[shoegazing]].<ref name="Talkhouse"/> Critics have also associated his music with [[chillwave]]<ref name="id"/><ref name="Gorillavsbear">{{Cite web |title=ALBUM PREMIERE: GEORGE CLANTON – 100% ELECTRONICA |url=https://www.gorillavsbear.net/album-premiere-george-clanton-100-electronica/ |website=[[Gorilla vs. Bear]] |access-date=2020-05-26}}</ref> and [[hypnagogic pop]].<ref name="Fact">{{Cite web |title=George Clanton drops Mirror Kisses moniker, wraps rage in glossy synths on ‘Wonder Gently’ |url=https://www.factmag.com/2015/07/29/george-clanton-mirror-kisses-wonder-gently/ |date=2015-07-29 |website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref><ref name="Needledrop">{{Cite web |title=George Clanton - Slide |url=https://www.theneedledrop.com/articles/2018/9/george-clanton-slide |last=Fantano |first=Anthony |date=2018-09-04 |website=[[The Needle Drop]] |access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref> Clanton noted that unlike some vaporwave artists, he does not try to be "ironic" or "silly with his lyrics", and prefers to "write great pop songs that are representative of an emotion that [he] actually [feels] when [he's] singing them."<ref name="id"/> He described his album ''Slide'' as a "vaporwave opera".<ref name="id"/> When he finds a sound that he likes, he uses it as often as he can, believing it helps him make his albums sound more cohesive and iconic.<ref name="id"/> Clanton's aim for his music is to evoke "[[nostalgia]]". When he starts writing a song, he randomly presses notes on his keyboard instrument and cycles through patches and effects until they trigger emotions and memories on him.<ref name="PopGun"/>

Although he is frequently associated with vaporwave, Clanton himself states that he embraces the tag purely for marketing purposes, and does not consider himself strictly a vaporwave musician.<ref name="id">{{Cite web |title=george clanton is the next cult electronic artist from the internet |url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/d3ek37/george-clanton-is-the-next-cult-electronic-artist-from-the-internet |last=Gooding |first=Sarah |date=August 13, 2018 |website=[[i-D]] |access-date=May 20, 2020}}</ref><ref name="SevenDays">{{Cite web |title=George Clanton on Vaporwave, Rebranding and His Record Label, 100% Electronica  |url=https://www.sevendaysvt.com/vermont/george-clanton-on-vaporwave-rebranding-and-his-record-label-100-electronica/Content?oid=4833985 |last=Adams |first=Jordan |date=2017-03-29 |website=[[Seven Days (newspaper)|Seven Days]] |access-date=2020-05-23}}</ref> Vaporwave is primarily an instrumental genre, which contradicts Clanton's use of vocals.
