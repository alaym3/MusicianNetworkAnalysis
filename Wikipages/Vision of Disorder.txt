'''Vision of Disorder''' is an American [[metalcore]] band from [[Long Island, New York]], that initially released three albums before disbanding in 2002. The band garnered attention for blending melody and groove into a traditional hardcore framework,<ref name=Bio>{{cite web|title=Vision of Disorder - Biography|url=https://www.facebook.com/VisionOfDisorder/info|publisher=Facebook.com|access-date=April 14, 2013}}</ref> but its attempts to pursue an [[alternative metal]] direction on its third album were met with limited commercial success.<ref name="Koch" /> The band reunited in 2008 and have since released two further albums, ''[[The Cursed Remain Cursed]]'' in 2012 and ''Razed to the Ground'' in 2015.

==History==
Guitarists Matt Baumbach and Mike Kennedy formed the band in 1992 with vocalist/lyricist Tim Williams, drummer Brendon Cohen, and bassist Mike Fleischmann. Vision of Disorder released a series of demos and contributed to several compilations before releasing the ''[[Still (Vision of Disorder EP)|Still EP]]'' in 1995 on [[Striving for Togetherness Records]]. The band appeared in the [[N.Y.H.C. (film)|N.Y.H.C.]] documentary around the same time. Vision of Disorder gained attention for incorporating different styles into its hardcore framework.<ref name=Tomb>{{cite web|title=Album Reviews: Vision of Disorder - The Cursed Remain Cursed|url=http://www.teufelstomb.com/reviews/vision-of-disorder-the-cursed-remain-cursed/|publisher=Teufel's Tomb|access-date=April 14, 2013}}</ref>

The band signed with [[Roadrunner Records]]' subsidiary, Supersoul, and released its [[Vision of Disorder (album)|self-titled full-length debut]] in 1996. The band was later praised for its impact upon the popularization of hardcore music: the debut album was "metallic hardcore that no one had heard, released for a mass audience on a big label. It had its merits; powerful, screamed vocals often layered over depressing clean vocals combined with fresh 'un-hardcore' guitar sections and unfamiliar drum patterns. For anyone into hardcore at the time, this was the album to have."<ref name="Tomb" />

Vision of Disorder's second album, ''[[Imprint (Vision of Disorder album)|Imprint]]'', was released in 1998 on Roadrunner Records and featured guest vocals by [[Pantera]]'s [[Phil Anselmo]] on the song "By the River".<ref name="Bio" /> The band was displeased with the raw production quality, which it attributed to the brief window for recording the album. Vision of Disorder also took issue with the purported lack of tour support by its record label.<ref name="Bio" /> The band and label severed their working relationship acrimoniously, as Williams recalls:

{{quote|1=Three years ago we were on Roadrunner and ''Imprint'' had just come out maybe two, three months ago and they weren't pushing us or doing anything...Roadrunner said "We're yanking your tour support, come home and make another record". But we wanted to go out and support ''Imprint'' and just felt insulted that they said that. So we said "Something is going on here, we're getting the fuck off of this label"...We want[ed] to go back to being a hardcore band and playing weekends and they tried to offer us money and a better deal but we were like "Nope, see you".<ref name=Roughedge>{{cite web|last=Downs|first=Alicia|title=From Bliss to Rough Edge: An Interview with Vision of Disorder's Mike Kennedy and Tim Williams|url=http://www.roughedge.com/features/vod0601interview.htm|website=Roughedge.com|access-date=14 April 2013}}</ref> }}

After the label strife, Vision of Disorder kept a relatively low profile. However, they eventually returned in 1999 with ''[[For the Bleeders]]'', a set of nine re-recorded demo songs released on [[Go-Kart Records]].

In 2001, Vision of Disorder released ''[[From Bliss to Devastation]]'' on [[TVT Records]]. The album marked a shift towards a traditional verse-chorus-verse songwriting structure. Kennedy described the album as "fitting in with the nu-metal scene"<ref name="Roughedge" /> while Williams praised the band's songwriting approach:

{{quote|1=The songwriting is much more stuck to the classic boundaries of songwriting as far as a verse and chorus. Before we had no respect for songwriting and that was our style and we liked that. But now we are getting older and we want to be able to make music that you can just sit back hit play and listen to it.<ref name="Roughedge" />}}

Reportedly frustrated by the lack of support from TVT, Vision of Disorder went on extended hiatus and eventually disbanded.<ref name=Koch>{{cite web|title=Vision of Disorder|url=http://www.kochrecords.com/artists/detail/?Artist=Vision+Of+Disorder|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130629150245/http://www.kochrecords.com/artists/detail/?Artist=Vision+Of+Disorder|url-status=dead|archive-date=June 29, 2013|publisher=[[Koch Records]]|access-date=April 14, 2013}}</ref> Williams and Kennedy formed the band [[Bloodsimple]] while Cohen and Fleischmann played in Karvnov.

Vision of Disorder reunited briefly in order to play three songs during a show with Bloodsimple and Karnov. The band played several one-off shows and shot footage for a DVD before formally reuniting in October 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=37541088 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Profile.myspace.com |access-date=October 13, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215062802/http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewProfile&friendID=37541088 |archive-date=December 15, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Williams described the material for the reunion album as similar to ''Imprint''.<ref name=Noisecreep>{{cite web|last=Harris|first=Chris|title=Vision of Disorder Still Writing Songs for New Album; Frontman Reveals Track Titles|url=http://www.noisecreep.com/2009/07/31/vision-of-disorder-still-writing-songs-for-new-album-frontman-r/|website=Noisecreep.com|access-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref> While the album was ultimately delayed several times, in July 2011, the first single, "The Enemy", was released on [[Candlelight Records]].

Around this time Matt Baumbach left the band, and former Mind Over Matter/dayinthelife guitarist Josh Demarco took his place in the line-up. VOD's next album was released on November 27, 2015, 'Razed to the Ground', via [[Candlelight Records]] (and was produced by [[Zeuss]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/25378/Vision-of-Disorder-to-release-new-album-in-November |title=Vision of Disorder to release new album in November |publisher=Lambgoat.com |date=September 16, 2015 |access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/VisionOfDisorder/photos/a.10151597360408862.1073741826.165917558861/10153128944678862/?type=1&theater |title=Mobile Uploads - Vision Of Disorder Official |publisher=Facebook |access-date=October 13, 2015}}</ref> [[AXS (company)|AXS]] contributor Terrance Pryor named the release one of the best metalcore records of 2015, calling it "a definite rager from start to finish".<ref name=AXS>{{cite web|title=The 5 best metalcore albums of 2015|url=https://www.axs.com/the-5-best-metalcore-albums-of-2015-72787|publisher=AXS|access-date=December 22, 2015}}</ref>
