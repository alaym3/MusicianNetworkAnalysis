==Artwork and title==
Kelly explained his personal thoughts in an interview with Beats 1 because of its nostalgic and dark feel, saying:

{{blockquote|"To me, and the reason it‚Äôs patched in on the back of my head and tattooed there, is because Hotel Diablo, it was right here‚Äîit was inside my head. The real you is never the perfect side of you. The real you is the honest side of you, and my honesty in going through my earlier years and in my 20s, it was dark.
I subconsciously wanted that as the cover the whole time because I was confronting my childhood problems on this album for the first time ever."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKjshA8b5lA |title=Machine Gun Kelly on his album "Hotel Diablo" |website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
}}

In an interview with ALT923Radio, Kelly revealed that the original name of the album was ''Delirium''. He explained why this didn't come to fruition:

{{blockquote|"I said that to Zane Lowe and he was... he made this point where he was like 'dude, that sounds like a shitty magic show in Vegas that like only... doesn't even have a residency of like every week but like every three weeks.'"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2jFA9fVHhU |title=Machine Gun Kelly Discusses Original Name of "Hotel Diablo" Record |website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Markos Papadatos of the Canadian internet news service ''Digital Journal'' praised the lyrics and overall album sound and mood. He wrote "Overall, Machine Gun Kelly has released a solid new album, ''Hotel Diablo''. It showcases his maturity and growth as a singer-songwriter and musician." Papadatos concluded with "Most impressive about Machine Gun Kelly is that the same energy that he exudes on this album, he displays on stage in a live setting, which is incredible." He gave the album an A rating.<ref name="DJ">{{cite news |last=Papadatos |first=Markos |title=Review: Machine Gun Kelly rocks on badass new album 'Hotel Diablo' |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/review-machine-gun-kelly-rocks-on-badass-new-album-hotel-diablo/article/553520 |website=Digital Journal |date=July 7, 2019 |access-date=July 10, 2019}}</ref>

Jeremy Markus of ''[[The Cornell Daily Sun]]'' gave the album a positive review, while also stating the album is a powerful successor to 2018's ''[[Binge (EP)|Binge]]''. He wrote, "Besides the improvement in writing, the album is simply much more enjoyable to listen to. Gone are the odd hooks and off-beat rapping from last year's project; they are replaced with intricate flows and a cohesive sound that spans across the entire production."<ref>{{cite news |last=Markus |first=Jeremy |title=TEST SPIN {{!}} Machine Gun Kelly ‚Äî 'Hotel Diablo' |url=https://cornellsun.com/2019/07/09/test-spin-machine-gun-kelly-hotel-diablo/ |newspaper=[[The Cornell Daily Sun]] |date=July 9, 2019 |access-date=July 10, 2019}}</ref>

A negative review came from Dhruva Balram of ''[[NME]]'', who said that "Despite the potency of its material, the project's lyricism feels apathetic. While his contemporaries, from [[Juice Wrld|Juice WLRD]] to [[Post Malone]], are pushing the envelope, crafting new sounds and forging new paths, MGK sticks to a tried-and-tested formula which, ultimately, feels bland. At times, the album feels stagnated, as if it's stuck in a 2012 timewarp." He concluded that it was "a formulaic album that's been re-worked with the same puzzle pieces: clever wordplay, catchy beats and enough meat on its body to keep it alive. But it doesn't have enough of those facets to be in any way distinguished."<ref name="NME">{{cite magazine |last=Balram |first=Dhruva |title=Machine Gun Kelly ‚Äì 'Hotel Diablo' review |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/review/machine-gun-kelly-hotel-diablo-review |magazine=[[NME]] |date=July 5, 2019 |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref>
