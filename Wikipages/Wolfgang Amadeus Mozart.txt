'''Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart'''{{efn|Sources vary in how Mozart's name should be pronounced in English. {{harvnb|Fradkin|1996}}, a guide for radio announcers, strongly recommends {{IPA|[ts]}} for letter ''z'' (thus {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ʊ|l|f|ɡ|æ|ŋ|_|ˌ|æ|m|ə|ˈ|d|eɪ|ə|s|_|ˈ|m|oʊ|t|s|ɑːr|t}} {{respell|WUULF|gang|_|AM|ə|DAY|əs|_|MOHT|sart}}), but otherwise considers English-like pronunciation fully acceptable.

Born in [[Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg|Salzburg]], in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], Mozart showed prodigious ability from his earliest childhood. Already competent on [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] and [[violin]], he composed from the age of five and performed before European royalty, embarking on a [[Mozart family grand tour|grand tour]]. At 17, Mozart was engaged as a musician at the Salzburg court but grew restless and travelled in search of a better position.

While visiting [[Vienna]] in 1781, he was dismissed from his Salzburg position. He chose to stay in Vienna, where he achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in Vienna, he composed many of his best-known [[List of symphonies by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|symphonies]], [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart#Concertos|concertos]], and [[List of operas by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|operas]], and portions of the [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]], which was largely unfinished at the time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of [[Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his death]] are largely uncertain, and have thus been much mythologized.

Despite his short life, his rapid pace of composition resulted in more than [[List of compositions by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|600 works]] of virtually every genre of his time. Many of these compositions are acknowledged as pinnacles of the [[symphony|symphonic]], [[concerto|concertante]], [[chamber music|chamber]], [[opera]]tic, and [[choir|choral]] repertoire. He is considered among the greatest [[classical music|classical]] composers of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.classicfm.com/composers/mozart/guides/mozart-appreciation/|title=Mozart: An Appreciation|website=classicfm.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=30 January 2020|title=The 50 Greatest Composers of All Time|url=http://www.classical-music.com/article/50-greatest-composers-all-time|url-status=live|website=www.classical-music.com|publisher=[[BBC Music Magazine]]}}</ref> and his influence on Western music is profound, particularly on [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. His elder colleague [[Joseph Haydn]] wrote: "posterity will not see such a talent again in 100 years".<ref>{{harvnb|Landon|1990|p=171}}</ref>

===Early life===
====Family and childhood====

{{see also|Mozart's name|Mozart family}}

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on 27 January 1756 to [[Leopold Mozart]] (1719–1787) and [[Anna Maria Mozart|Anna Maria]], née Pertl (1720–1778), at [[Mozart's birthplace|Getreidegasse 9]] in [[Salzburg]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Austria|first1=Rosemarie|last1=Arnold|first2=Robert|last2=Taylor|first3=Rainer|last3=Eisenschmid|year=2009|publisher=Baedeker|isbn=978-3-8297-6613-5|oclc=416424772}}</ref> Salzburg was the capital of the [[Archbishopric of Salzburg]], an ecclesiastic principality in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (today in [[Austria]]).{{efn|Source: {{harvnb|Wilson|1999|p=2}}. The many changes of European political borders since Mozart's time make it difficult to assign him an unambiguous nationality; for discussion, see [[Mozart's nationality]].}} He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was [[Maria Anna Mozart]] (1751–1829), nicknamed "Nannerl". Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at [[Salzburg Cathedral|St. Rupert's Cathedral]] in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in Latinized form, as ''Joannes<!--This is not a spelling mistake; it is indeed "Joannes"--> Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart''. He generally called himself "Wolfgang Amadè Mozart"<!--Caution to outraged Francophones: this is of course not "correct" orthography in either (modern) French or even Italian. The point here is that it is the way Mozart (wrongly?) spelled it, according to the source.--><ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=9}}</ref> as an adult, but [[Mozart's name|his name]] had many variants.

Leopold Mozart, a native of [[Augsburg]],<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=21}}</ref> then an Imperial Free City in the Holy Roman Empire, was a minor composer and an experienced teacher. In 1743, he was appointed as fourth violinist in the musical establishment of [[Count Leopold Anton von Firmian]], the ruling [[Archbishopric of Salzburg#Prince-Bishopric (1213–1803)|Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg]].<ref name="Eisen">{{harvnb|Eisen}}</ref> Four years later, he married Anna Maria in Salzburg. Leopold became the orchestra's deputy [[Kapellmeister]] in 1763. During the year of his son's birth, Leopold published a violin textbook, ''[[Versuch einer gründlichen Violinschule]]'', which achieved success.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=32}}

When Nannerl was 7, she began keyboard lessons with her father, while her three-year-old brother looked on. Years later, after her brother's death, she reminisced:
<blockquote>He often spent much time at the [[Keyboard instrument|clavier]], picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good.{{nbsp}}... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier.{{nbsp}}... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time.{{nbsp}}... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down.<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=455}}</ref></blockquote>

Watercolour by [[Louis Carrogis Carmontelle|Carmontelle]], c.{{nbsp}}1763<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=44}}</ref>]]
These early pieces, [[Köchel catalogue|K.]] 1–5, were recorded in the ''[[Nannerl Notenbuch]]''. There is some scholarly debate about whether Mozart was four or five years old when he created his first musical compositions, though there is little doubt that Mozart composed his first three pieces of music within a few weeks of each other: K. 1a, 1b, and 1c.<ref>{{IMSLP

In his early years, Wolfgang's father was his only teacher. Along with music, he taught his children languages and academic subjects.<ref name="solomon 1995 39" /> Solomon notes that, while Leopold was a devoted teacher to his children, there is evidence that Mozart was keen to progress beyond what he was taught.<ref name="solomon 1995 39">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|pp=39–40}}</ref> His first ink-spattered composition and his precocious efforts with the violin were of his initiative and came as a surprise to Leopold,<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=453}}</ref> who eventually gave up composing when his son's musical talents became evident.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=33}}</ref>

====1762–73: Travel====

{{Main| Mozart family grand tour|Mozart in Italy}}

While Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as [[Child prodigy|child prodigies]]. These began with an exhibition in 1762 at the court of [[Prince-elector]] [[Maximilian III Joseph, Elector of Bavaria|Maximilian III]] of Bavaria in Munich, and at the Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague. A long concert tour followed, spanning three and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich, [[Mannheim]], Paris, London,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart {{!}} Composer {{!}} Blue Plaques|url=https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/blue-plaques/wolfgang-amadeus-mozart/|access-date=25 September 2020|website=English Heritage}}</ref> Dover, The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht, [[Mechelen]] and again to Paris, and back home via [[Zurich]], [[Donaueschingen]], and Munich.{{sfn|Grove|1954|page=926}} During this trip, Wolfgang met many musicians and acquainted himself with the works of other composers. A particularly significant influence was [[Johann Christian Bach]], whom he visited in London in 1764 and 1765. When he was eight years old, Mozart wrote his first symphony, most of which was probably transcribed by his father.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mozart Biography|website= midiworld.com|url=http://midiworld.com/mozart1.htm|access-date=20 December 2014|date=2009|first=Joe|last=Meerdter}}</ref>

The family trips were often challenging, and travel conditions were primitive.<ref>{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=51, 53}}</ref> They had to wait for invitations and reimbursement from the nobility, and they endured long, near-fatal illnesses far from home: first Leopold (London, summer 1764),<ref>{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=82–83}}</ref> then both children (The Hague, autumn 1765).<ref>{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=99–102}}</ref> The family again went to Vienna in late 1767 and remained there until December 1768.

After one year in Salzburg, Leopold and Wolfgang set off for Italy, leaving Anna Maria and Nannerl at home. This tour lasted from December 1769 to March 1771. As with earlier journeys, Leopold wanted to display his son's abilities as a performer and a rapidly maturing composer. Wolfgang met [[Josef Mysliveček]] and [[Giovanni Battista Martini]] in [[Bologna]] and was accepted as a member of the famous [[Accademia Filarmonica di Bologna|Accademia Filarmonica]]. In Rome, he heard [[Gregorio Allegri]]'s ''[[Miserere (Allegri)|Miserere]]'' twice in performance, in the [[Sistine Chapel]], and wrote it out from memory, thus producing the first unauthorized copy of this closely guarded property of the [[Holy See|Vatican]].<ref>{{harvnb|Gutman|2000|p=271}}.

In Milan, Mozart wrote the opera ''[[Mitridate, re di Ponto]]'' (1770), which was performed with success. This led to further opera [[commission (art)|commissions]]. He returned with his father twice to Milan (August–December 1771; October 1772{{snd}}March 1773) for the composition and premieres of ''[[Ascanio in Alba]]'' (1771) and ''[[Lucio Silla]]'' (1772). Leopold hoped these visits would result in a professional appointment for his son, and indeed ruling [[Ferdinand Karl, Archduke of Austria-Este|Archduke Ferdinand]] contemplated hiring Mozart, but owing to his mother [[Maria Theresa|Empress Maria Theresa]]'s reluctance to employ "useless people", the matter was dropped{{efn|{{harvnb|Eisen|Keefe|2006|p=268}}: "You ask me to take the young Salzburger into your service. I do not know why, not believing that you have need for a composer or of useless people.{{nbsp}}... What I say is intended only to prevent you burdening yourself with useless people and giving titles to people of that sort. In addition, if they are at your service, it degrades that service when these people go about the world like beggars."}} and Leopold's hopes were never realized.<ref>{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|pp=172, 183–185}}</ref> Toward the end of the journey, Mozart wrote the solo [[motet]] ''[[Exsultate, jubilate]]'', [[Köchel catalogue|K.]]&nbsp;165.

===1773–77: Employment at the Salzburg court===

[[File:Mozart's old home.jpg|thumb|upright|{{interlanguage link|Tanzmeisterhaus|de}}, Salzburg, Mozart family residence from 1773; reconstructed 1996]]

After finally returning with his father from Italy on 13 March 1773, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg, [[Hieronymus von Colloredo (1732–1812)|Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo]]. The composer had many friends and admirers in Salzburg<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=106}}</ref> and had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, [[Mass (music)|masses]], serenades, and a few minor operas. Between April and December 1775, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication. The last three—[[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;216]], [[Violin Concerto No. 4 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;218]], [[Violin Concerto No. 5 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;219]]—are now staples of the repertoire. In 1776, he turned his efforts to [[Mozart piano concertos|piano concertos]], culminating in the E{{music|flat}} concerto [[Piano Concerto No. 9 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;271]] of early 1777, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=103}}</ref>

Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year;<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=98}}</ref> Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in 1775 when the court theatre was closed, especially since the other theatre in Salzburg was primarily reserved for visiting troupes.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=107}}</ref>

Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay. Mozart and his father visited Vienna from 14 July to 26 September 1773, and Munich from 6{{nbsp}}December 1774 to March 1775. Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera ''[[La finta giardiniera]]''.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=109}}</ref>

===1777–78: Journey to Paris===

In August 1777, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburg<ref>{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|p=225}}</ref>{{efn|Archbishop Colloredo responded to the request by dismissing both Mozart and his father, though the dismissal of the latter was not actually carried out.}} and on 23 September ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to [[Augsburg]], Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadie|1998}}</ref>

Mozart became acquainted with members of the [[Mannheim school|famous orchestra]] in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with [[Aloysia Weber]], one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing,<ref>{{cite book|author=Drebes, Gerald|title=Die 'Mannheimer Schule'—ein Zentrum der vorklassischen Musik und Mozart|location=Heidelberg|date=1992|url=http://www.gerald-drebes.ch/page8.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150207142809/http://www.gerald-drebes.ch/page8.html|archive-date=7 February 2015}}</ref> and Mozart left for Paris on 14 March 1778<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=174}}</ref> to continue his search.

While Mozart was in Paris, his father was pursuing opportunities of employment for him in Salzburg.<ref>{{harvnb|Halliwell|1998|loc=chs. 18–19}}</ref> With the support of the local nobility, Mozart was offered a post as court organist and concertmaster.

Among the better-known works which Mozart wrote on the Paris journey are the [[Piano Sonata No. 8 (Mozart)|A minor piano sonata]], K.&nbsp;310/300d, the [[Symphony No. 31 (Mozart)|"Paris" Symphony]] (No.&nbsp;31), which were performed in Paris on 12 and 18 June 1778.<ref>{{harvnb|Deutsch|1965|p=176}}</ref> and the [[Concerto for Flute, Harp, and Orchestra (Mozart)|Concerto for Flute and Harp]] in C major, K. 299/297c.{{sfn|Einstein|1965|pp=276–277}}

===Vienna===
====1781: Departure====

[[File:Croce MozartFamilyPortrait.jpg|thumb|[[Mozart family]], c. 1780 ([[Johann Nepomuk della Croce|della Croce]]); the portrait on the wall is of Mozart's mother.]]

In January 1781, Mozart's opera ''[[Idomeneo]]'' premiered with "considerable success" in Munich.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadie|1980|loc=vol. 12, p. 700}}</ref> The following March, Mozart was summoned to Vienna, where his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, was attending the celebrations for the accession of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] to the Austrian throne. For Colloredo, this was simply a matter of wanting his musical servant to be at hand (Mozart indeed was required to dine in Colloredo's establishment with the valets and cooks).{{efn|Mozart complains of this in a letter to his father, dated 24 March 1781.{{sfn|Spaethling|2000|p=235}}}} However, Mozart was planning a bigger career even as he continued in the archbishop's service;{{sfn|Spaethling|2000|p=238}} for example, he wrote to his father:
<blockquote>My main goal right now is to meet the emperor in some agreeable fashion, I am absolutely determined he {{em|should get to know me}}. I would be so happy if I could whip through my opera for him and then play a fugue or two, for that's what he likes.<ref name=Spaethling237>{{harvnb|Spaethling|2000|p=237}}; the letter dates from 24 March 1781.</ref></blockquote>

Mozart did indeed soon meet the Emperor, who eventually was to support his career substantially with commissions and a part-time position.

In the same letter to his father just quoted, Mozart outlined his plans to participate as a soloist in the concerts of the ''[[Tonkünstler-Societät]]'', a prominent benefit concert series;<ref name=Spaethling237 /> this plan as well came to pass after the local nobility prevailed on Colloredo to drop his opposition.{{sfn|Spaethling|2000|pp=238–239}}

Colloredo's wish to prevent Mozart from performing outside his establishment was in other cases, however, carried through, raising the composer's anger; one example was a chance to perform before the Emperor at [[Maria Wilhelmine Thun|Countess Thun]]'s for a fee equal to half of his yearly Salzburg salary.

The quarrel with the archbishop came to a head in May: Mozart attempted to resign and was refused. The following month, permission was granted, but in a grossly insulting way: the composer was dismissed literally "with a kick in the arse", administered by the archbishop's steward, Count Arco. Mozart decided to settle in Vienna as a freelance performer and composer.<ref name="sadie 1998 4" />

The quarrel with Colloredo was more difficult for Mozart because his father sided against him. Hoping fervently that he would obediently follow Colloredo back to Salzburg, Mozart's father exchanged intense letters with his son, urging him to be reconciled with their employer. Mozart passionately defended his intention to pursue an independent career in Vienna. The debate ended when Mozart was dismissed by the archbishop, freeing himself both of his employer and of his father's demands to return. Solomon characterizes Mozart's resignation as a "revolutionary step" that significantly altered the course of his life.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=247}}</ref>

====Early years====

{{see also|Haydn and Mozart|Mozart and Freemasonry}}

Mozart's new career in Vienna began well. He often performed as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with [[Muzio Clementi]] on 24 December 1781,<ref name="sadie 1998 4">{{harvnb|Sadie|1998|loc=§4}}</ref> and he soon "had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna".<ref name="sadie 1998 4" /> He also prospered as a composer, and in 1782 completed the opera ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'' ("The Abduction from the Seraglio"), which premiered on 16 July 1782 and achieved considerable success. The work was soon being performed "throughout German-speaking Europe",<ref name="sadie 1998 4" /> and thoroughly established Mozart's reputation as a composer.

[[File:Costanze Mozart by Lange 1782.jpg|thumb|upright|1782 portrait of [[Constanze Mozart]] by her brother-in-law [[Joseph Lange]]]]
Near the height of his quarrels with Colloredo, Mozart moved in with the Weber family, who had moved to Vienna from Mannheim. The family's father, Fridolin, had died, and the Webers were now taking in lodgers to make ends meet.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=253}}</ref>

====Marriage and children====

After failing to win the hand of Aloysia Weber, who was now married to the actor and artist [[Joseph Lange]], Mozart's interest shifted to the third daughter of the family, [[Constanze Mozart|Constanze]].

The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly separated in April 1782.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=259}}</ref> Mozart faced a challenging task in getting his father's permission for the marriage.<ref name=Sol258>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=258}}</ref> The couple were finally married on 4{{nbsp}}August 1782 in [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Vienna|St. Stephen's Cathedral]], the day before his father's consenting letter arrived in the mail.<ref name=Sol258 />

The couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy:{{sfn|Solomon|1995|pp=265–266}}
* Raimund Leopold (17 June{{snd}}19 August 1783)
* [[Karl Thomas Mozart]] (21 September 1784{{snd}}31 October 1858)
* Johann Thomas Leopold (18 October{{snd}}15 November 1786)
* Theresia Constanzia Adelheid Friedericke Maria Anna (27 December 1787{{snd}}29 June 1788)
* Anna Maria (died soon after birth, 16 November 1789)
* [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart]] (26 July 1791{{snd}}29 July 1844)

===1782–87===

In 1782 and 1783, Mozart became intimately acquainted with the work of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and [[George Frideric Handel]] as a result of the influence of [[Gottfried van Swieten]], who owned many manuscripts of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]] masters. Mozart's study of these scores inspired compositions in Baroque style and later influenced his musical language, for example in [[fugue|fugal]] passages in ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]'' ("The Magic Flute") and the finale of [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|Symphony No.&nbsp;41]].<ref name="Eisen"/>

In 1783, Mozart and his wife visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially polite to Constanze, but the visit prompted the composition of one of Mozart's great liturgical pieces, the [[Great Mass in C minor|Mass in C minor]]. Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=270}}</ref>

Mozart met [[Joseph Haydn]] in Vienna around 1784, and the two composers became friends. When Haydn visited Vienna, they sometimes played together in an impromptu [[string quartet]]. Mozart's [[Haydn Quartets (Mozart)|six quartets dedicated to Haydn]] (K.&nbsp;387, K.&nbsp;421, K.&nbsp;428, K.&nbsp;458, K.&nbsp;464, and K.&nbsp;465) date from the period 1782 to 1785, and are judged to be a response to Haydn's [[List of string quartets by Joseph Haydn#Opus 33 (1781)|Opus 33]] set from 1781.<ref>{{harvnb|Barry|2000}}.

Leopold's letter to his daughter [[Maria Anna Mozart|Nannerl]], 14–16 May 1785.</ref>

From 1782 to 1785 Mozart mounted concerts with himself as a soloist, presenting three or four new piano concertos in each season. Since space in the theatres was scarce, he booked unconventional venues: a large room in the Trattnerhof apartment building, and the ballroom of the Mehlgrube restaurant.<ref name="solomon 1995 293">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=293}}</ref> The concerts were very popular, and [[Piano concertos by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|his concertos]] premiered there are still firm fixtures in his repertoire. Solomon writes that during this period, Mozart created "a harmonious connection between an eager composer-performer and a delighted audience, which was given the opportunity of witnessing the transformation and perfection of a major musical genre".<ref name="solomon 1995 293" />

With substantial returns from his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart and his wife adopted a more luxurious lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins.<ref name="solomon 1995 298">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=298}}</ref> Mozart bought a fine [[fortepiano]] from [[Anton Walter]] for about 900 florins, and a [[Carom billiards|billiard]] table for about 300.<ref name="solomon 1995 298" /> The Mozarts sent their son [[Karl Thomas Mozart|Karl Thomas]] to an expensive boarding school<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=430}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=578}}</ref> and kept servants. During this period Mozart saved little of his income.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|loc=§27}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=431}}</ref>

On 14 December 1784, Mozart became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], admitted to the lodge Zur Wohltätigkeit ("Beneficence").<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=321}}</ref> Freemasonry played an essential role in the remainder of Mozart's life: he attended meetings, a number of his friends were Masons, and on various occasions, he composed Masonic music, e.g. the [[Maurerische Trauermusik]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rushton|first=Julian|author-link=Julian Rushton|title=Mozart: An Extraordinary Life|page=67|publisher=[[ABRSM#ABRSM publications|Associated Board of the Royal School of Music]]|year=2005}}</ref>

====1786–87: Return to opera====

[[File:Mozartův klavír 1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Fortepiano]] played by Mozart in 1787, Czech Museum of Music, Prague<ref>{{cite news|title=Czech Museum of Music to display "Mozart" piano|url=https://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/czech-museum-of-music-to-display-mozart-piano|website=Radio Praha|access-date=14 December 2018|date=31 January 2007}}</ref>]]

Despite the great success of ''[[Die Entführung aus dem Serail]]'', Mozart did little operatic writing for the next four years, producing only two unfinished works and the one-act ''[[Der Schauspieldirektor]]''. He focused instead on his career as a piano soloist and writer of concertos. Around the end of 1785, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing<ref name="harvnb|Solomon|1995">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=September 2010}} and began his famous operatic collaboration with the [[Libretto|librettist]] [[Lorenzo Da Ponte]]. 1786 saw the successful premiere of ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' in Vienna. Its reception in [[Mozart and Prague|Prague]] later in the year was even warmer, and this led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte: the opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', which premiered in October 1787 to acclaim in Prague, but less success in Vienna during 1788.<ref>{{harvnb|Freeman|2021|pp=131–168}}</ref> The two are among Mozart's most famous works and are mainstays of operatic repertoire today, though at their premieres their musical complexity caused difficulty both for listeners and for performers. These developments were not witnessed by Mozart's father, who had died on 28 May 1787.<ref>{{cite book|author=Palmer, Willard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bs0cSyGLaNMC&pg=PA4 |title=W.A.

In December 1787, Mozart finally obtained a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed him as his "chamber composer", a post that had fallen vacant the previous month on the death of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]]. It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the [[Hofburg Palace|Redoutensaal]] (see ''[[Mozart and dance]]''). This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. Court records show that Joseph aimed to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects.<ref name="solomon 1995 423">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|pp=423–424}}</ref>{{efn|A more recent view, {{harvnb|Wolff|2012}}, is that Mozart's position was a more substantial one than is traditionally maintained, and that some of Mozart's chamber music from this time was written as part of his imperial duties.}}

In 1787, the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]] spent several weeks in Vienna, hoping to study with Mozart.<ref>{{harvnb|Haberl|2006|pp=215–255}}</ref> No reliable records survive to indicate whether the [[Beethoven and Mozart|two composers]] ever met.

===Later years===
====1788–90====

[[File:Mozart drawing Doris Stock 1789.jpg|thumb|upright|Drawing of Mozart in [[silverpoint]], made by [[Dora Stock]] during Mozart's visit to Dresden, April 1789]]

Toward the end of the decade, Mozart's circumstances worsened. Around 1786 he had ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank.<ref name="sadie 1998 6">{{harvnb|Sadie|1998|loc=§6}}</ref> This was a difficult time for musicians in Vienna because of the [[Austro-Turkish War (1787–1791)|Austro-Turkish War]]: both the general level of prosperity and the ability of the aristocracy to support music had declined.<ref name="harvnb|Solomon|1995" />

By mid-1788, Mozart and his family had moved from central Vienna to the suburb of [[Alsergrund]].<ref name="sadie 1998 6" /> Although it has been suggested that Mozart aimed to reduce his rental expenses by moving to a suburb, as he wrote in his letter to [[Michael von Puchberg]], Mozart had not reduced his expenses but merely increased the housing space at his disposal.<ref>{{harvnb|Lorenz|2010}}</ref> Mozart began to borrow money, most often from his friend and fellow mason Puchberg; "a pitiful sequence of letters pleading for loans" survives.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadie|1980|loc=vol. 12, p. 710}}</ref> Maynard Solomon and others have suggested that Mozart was suffering from depression, and it seems his musical output slowed.<ref>{{harvnb|Steptoe|1990|p=208}}</ref> Major works of the period include the last three symphonies (Nos.&nbsp;[[Symphony No. 39 (Mozart)|39]], [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|40]], and [[Symphony No. 41 (Mozart)|41]], all from 1788), and the last of the three Da Ponte operas, ''[[Così fan tutte]]'', premiered in 1790.

Around this time, Mozart made some long journeys hoping to improve his fortunes, visiting Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin in the spring of 1789, and [[Frankfurt]], Mannheim, and other German cities in 1790.

====1791====

Mozart's last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity—and by some accounts, one of personal recovery.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|loc=§30}}</ref>{{efn|More recently, {{harvnb|Wolff|2012}} has forcefully advocated a view of Mozart's career at the end of his life as being on the rise, interrupted by his sudden death.}} He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera ''[[The Magic Flute]]''; the final piano concerto ([[Piano Concerto No. 27 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;595 in B{{music|flat}}]]); the [[Clarinet Concerto (Mozart)|Clarinet Concerto]] K.&nbsp;622; the last in his series of string quintets ([[String Quintet No. 6 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;614 in E{{music|flat}}]]); the motet [[Ave verum corpus (Mozart)|Ave verum corpus]] K.&nbsp;618; and the unfinished [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]] K.&nbsp;626.

Mozart's financial situation, a source of anxiety in 1790, finally began to improve. Although the evidence is inconclusive,<ref name="solomon 1995 477">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=477}}</ref> it appears that wealthy patrons in Hungary and Amsterdam pledged annuities to Mozart in return for the occasional composition. He is thought to have benefited from the sale of dance music written in his role as Imperial chamber composer.<ref name="solomon 1995 477" /> Mozart no longer borrowed large sums from Puchberg and began to pay off his debts.<ref name="solomon 1995 477" />

He experienced great satisfaction in the public success of some of his works, notably ''The Magic Flute'' (which was performed several times in the short period between its premiere and Mozart's death)<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=487}}</ref> and the Little Masonic Cantata K.&nbsp;623, premiered on 17 November 1791.<ref>And not as previously stated on 15 November; see {{harvnb|Abert|2007|p=1307, fn 9}}</ref>

====Final illness and death====

{{Main|Death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}

Mozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on 6{{nbsp}}September 1791, of his opera ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', which was written in that same year on commission for the Emperor's coronation festivities.<ref>{{harvnb|Freeman|2021|pp=193–230}}</ref> He continued his professional functions for some time and conducted the premiere of ''[[The Magic Flute]]'' on 30 September. His health deteriorated on 20 November, at which point he became bedridden, suffering from swelling, pain, and vomiting.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|p=491}}

[[File:Wolfgang-amadeus-mozart 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Posthumous painting by [[Barbara Krafft]] in 1819]]
Mozart was nursed in his final days by his wife and her youngest sister, and was attended by the family doctor, Thomas Franz Closset. He was mentally occupied with the task of finishing his [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem]], but the evidence that he dictated passages to his student [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr]] is minimal.{{sfn|Solomon|1995|pp=493, 588}}

Mozart died in his home on {{death date and age|df=yes|1791|12|05|1756|01|27}} at 12:55 am.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicfm.com/composers/mozart/guides/mozarts-final-year-1791/|title=Mozart's final year and death—1791|publisher=[[Classic FM (UK)]]}}</ref> The ''[[The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|New Grove]]'' describes his funeral:
<blockquote>Mozart was interred in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the [[St. Marx Cemetery]] outside the city on 7{{nbsp}}December. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later [[Otto Jahn]] (1856) wrote that [[Antonio Salieri|Salieri]], [[Franz Xaver Süssmayr|Süssmayr]], [[Gottfried van Swieten|van Swieten]] and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day was calm and mild.<ref>{{harvnb|Sadie|1980|loc=vol. 12, p. 716}}</ref></blockquote>

The expression "common grave" refers to neither a communal grave nor a pauper's grave, but an individual grave for a member of the common people (i.e., not the aristocracy). Common graves were subject to excavation after ten years; the graves of aristocrats were not.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.aproposmozart.com/Brauneis%20--%20Dies%20irae.rev.Index.pdf|author={{interlanguage link|Walther Brauneis|de|lt=Brauneis, Walther}}|title=Dies irae, dies illa—Day of wrath, day of wailing: Notes on the commissioning, origin and completion of Mozart's Requiem (KV 626)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071543/http://www.aproposmozart.com/Brauneis%20--%20Dies%20irae.rev.Index.pdf|archive-date=7 April 2014}}</ref>

The cause of Mozart's death is not known with certainty. The official record of ''hitziges Frieselfieber'' ("severe miliary fever",<!--this is not a typo--> referring to a rash that looks like [[millet|millet seeds]]) is more a symptomatic description than a diagnosis.

Mozart's modest funeral did not reflect his standing with the public as a composer; memorial services and concerts in Vienna and Prague were well-attended. Indeed, in the period immediately after his death, his reputation rose substantially. Solomon describes an "unprecedented wave of enthusiasm"<ref name="Solomonp499">{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=499}}</ref> for his work; [[Biographies of Mozart|biographies were written]] first by [[Friedrich Schlichtegroll|Schlichtegroll]], [[Franz Xaver Niemetschek|Niemetschek]], and [[Georg Nikolaus von Nissen|Nissen]], and publishers vied to produce complete editions of his works.<ref name="Solomonp499" />

==Appearance and character==

[[File:Mozart (unfinished) by Lange 1782.jpg|thumb|Detail of portrait of Mozart by his brother-in-law Joseph Lange; for discussion of the portrait, see [[Joseph Lange]]]]

Mozart's physical appearance was described by tenor [[Michael Kelly (tenor)|Michael Kelly]] in his ''Reminiscences'': "a remarkably small man, very thin and pale, with a profusion of fine, fair hair of which he was rather vain". His early biographer Niemetschek wrote, "there was nothing special about [his] physique.{{nbsp}}... He was small and his countenance, except for his large intense eyes, gave no signs of his genius." His facial complexion was pitted, a reminder of his [[Mozart and smallpox|childhood case of smallpox]].<ref name= Telegraph/> Of his voice, his wife later wrote that it "was a tenor, rather soft in speaking and delicate in singing, but when anything excited him, or it became necessary to exert it, it was both powerful and energetic."<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=308}}</ref>

He loved elegant clothing. Kelly remembered him at a rehearsal: {{nowrap|"[He]}} was on the stage with his crimson [[pelisse]] and gold-laced [[Bicorne|cocked hat]], giving the time of the music to the orchestra." Based on pictures that researchers were able to find of Mozart, he seemed to wear a white wig for most of his formal occasions—researchers of the [[Salzburg Mozarteum]] declared that only one of his fourteen portraits they had found showed him without his wig.<ref name= Telegraph>{{cite news|title=Discovered, new Mozart portrait that shows musician without his wig|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/9797143/Discovered-new-Mozart-portrait-that-shows-musician-without-his-wig.html|website=The Telegraph|access-date=7 May 2018|date=11 January 2013}}</ref>

Mozart usually worked long and hard, finishing compositions at a tremendous pace as deadlines approached. He often made sketches and drafts; unlike Beethoven's, these are mostly not preserved, as his wife sought to destroy them after his death.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=310}}</ref>

Mozart lived at the center of the Viennese musical world, and knew a significant number and variety of people: fellow musicians, theatrical performers, fellow Salzburgers, and aristocrats, including some acquaintance with Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]]. Solomon considers his three closest friends to have been Gottfried von Jacquin, Count August Hatzfeld, and Sigmund Barisani; others included his elder colleague [[Joseph Haydn]], singers [[Franz Xaver Gerl]] and [[Benedikt Schack]], and the horn player [[Joseph Leutgeb]]. Leutgeb and Mozart carried on a curious kind of friendly mockery, often with Leutgeb as the butt of Mozart's [[practical joke]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|loc=§20}}</ref>

He enjoyed [[billiards]], dancing, and kept pets, including a canary, a [[Mozart's starling|starling]], a dog, and a horse for recreational riding.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=319}}</ref> He had a startling fondness for [[Mozart and scatology|scatological humour]], which is preserved in his surviving letters, notably those written to his cousin [[Maria Anna Thekla Mozart]] around 1777–1778, and in his correspondence with his sister and parents.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=169}}</ref> Mozart also wrote scatological music, a series of [[Canon (music)|canons]] that he sang with his friends.<ref>A list of the canons may be found at [[Mozart and scatology#In music]].</ref> Mozart [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and the Catholic Church|was raised a Catholic]] and remained a devout member of the Church throughout his life.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goldstein|first1=Jack|title=101 Amazing Mozart Facts|date=2013|publisher=Andrews UK Limited}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Abert|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=l6I6BwTMJ3sC&pg=PA743 743]}}</ref>

Mozart's music, like [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s, stands as an archetype of the [[Classical period (music)|Classical style]]. At the time he began composing, European music was dominated by the ''[[galant|style galant]]'', a reaction against the highly evolved intricacy of the [[Baroque music|Baroque]]. Progressively, and in large part at the hands of Mozart himself, the [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] complexities of the late Baroque emerged once more, moderated and disciplined by new [[Musical form|forms]], and adapted to a new aesthetic and social milieu. Mozart was a versatile composer, and wrote in every major genre, including [[symphony]], opera, the solo concerto, chamber music including [[string quartet]] and [[string quintet]], and the piano [[sonata]]. These forms were not new, but Mozart advanced their technical sophistication and emotional reach. He almost single-handedly developed and popularized the Classical [[Mozart piano concertos|piano concerto]]. He wrote a great deal of [[religious music]], including large-scale [[mass (music)|masses]], as well as dances, [[divertimento|divertimenti]], [[serenade]]s, and other forms of light entertainment.{{sfn|Grove|1954|pages=[https://archive.org/details/grovesdictionary01grov/page/958 958–982]}}

The central traits of the Classical style are all present in Mozart's music. Clarity, balance, and transparency are the hallmarks of his work, but simplistic notions of its delicacy mask the exceptional power of his finest masterpieces, such as the [[Piano Concerto No. 24 (Mozart)|Piano Concerto No. 24]] in C minor, K.&nbsp;491; the [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|Symphony No.&nbsp;40]] in G minor, K.&nbsp;550; and the opera ''[[Don Giovanni]]''. [[Charles Rosen]] makes the point forcefully:

<blockquote>It is only through recognizing the violence and sensuality at the center of Mozart's work that we can make a start towards a comprehension of his structures and an insight into his magnificence. In a paradoxical way, [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]]'s superficial characterization of the [[Symphony No. 40 (Mozart)|G minor Symphony]] can help us to see Mozart's daemon more steadily. In all of Mozart's supreme expressions of suffering and terror, there is something shockingly voluptuous.<ref>{{harvnb|Rosen|1998|p=324}}</ref></blockquote>

During his last decade, Mozart frequently exploited [[Chromaticism|chromatic]] harmony. A notable instance is his [[String Quartet No. 19 (Mozart)|''String Quartet in C major'', K.&nbsp;465]] (1785), whose introduction abounds in chromatic suspensions, giving rise to the work's nickname, the "Dissonance" quartet.

Mozart had a gift for absorbing and adapting the valuable features of others' music. His travels helped in the forging of a unique compositional language.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|loc=ch. 8}}. Discussion of the sources of style as well as his early imitative ability.</ref> In London as a child, he met [[Johann Christian Bach|J.&nbsp;C. Bach]] and heard his music. In Paris, Mannheim, and Vienna he met with other compositional influences, as well as the avant-garde capabilities of the [[Mannheim school|Mannheim orchestra]]. In Italy, he encountered the [[Italian overture]] and [[opera buffa]], both of which deeply affected the evolution of his practice. In London and Italy, the galant style was in the ascendent: simple, light music with a mania for [[cadence (music)|cadencing]]; an emphasis on tonic, dominant, and subdominant to the exclusion of other harmonies; symmetrical phrases; and clearly articulated partitions in the overall form of movements.<ref>{{harvnb|Heartz|2003}}</ref> Some of Mozart's early symphonies are [[Italian overture]]s, with three movements running into each other; many are [[homotonal]] (all three movements having the same key signature, with the slow middle movement being in the [[Relative key|relative minor]]). Others mimic the works of J.&nbsp;C. Bach, and others show the simple [[binary form|rounded binary forms]] turned out by Viennese composers.

[[File:K626 Requiem Dies Irae.jpg|thumb|Facsimile sheet of music from the Dies Irae movement of the [[Requiem (Mozart)|Requiem Mass in D minor]] (K.&nbsp;626) in Mozart's handwriting ([[Mozarthaus Vienna|Mozarthaus]], Vienna)]]
As Mozart matured, he progressively incorporated more features adapted from the Baroque. For example, the [[Symphony No. 29 (Mozart)|Symphony No.&nbsp;29 in A major]] K.&nbsp;201 has a contrapuntal main theme in its first movement, and experimentation with irregular phrase lengths. Some of his quartets from 1773 have fugal finales, probably influenced by Haydn, who had included three such finales in his recently published Opus&nbsp;20 set. The influence of the ''[[Sturm und Drang]]'' ("Storm and Stress") period in music, with its brief foreshadowing of the [[Romanticism|Romantic era]], is evident in the music of both composers at that time. Mozart's [[Symphony No. 25 (Mozart)|Symphony No.&nbsp;25 in G minor]] K.&nbsp;183 is another excellent example.

Mozart would sometimes switch his focus between operas and instrumental music. He produced operas in each of the prevailing styles: [[opera buffa]], such as ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'', ''[[Don Giovanni]]'', and ''[[Così fan tutte]]''; [[opera seria]], such as ''[[Idomeneo]]''; and [[Singspiel]], of which ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]'' is the most famous example by any composer. In his later operas, he employed subtle changes in instrumentation, orchestral texture, and [[Timbre|tone colour]], for emotional depth and to mark dramatic shifts. Here his advances in opera and instrumental composing interacted: his increasingly sophisticated use of the orchestra in the symphonies and concertos influenced his operatic orchestration, and his developing subtlety in using the orchestra to psychological effect in his operas was in turn reflected in his later non-operatic compositions.{{sfn|Einstein|1965|p={{page needed|date=July 2020}}}}

===Köchel catalogue===
{{Main|Köchel catalogue}}

For unambiguous identification of works by Mozart, a ''Köchel catalogue number'' is used. This is a unique number assigned, in regular chronological order, to every one of his known works. A work is referenced by the abbreviation "K." or "KV" followed by this number. The first edition of the catalogue was completed in 1862 by [[Ludwig Ritter von Köchel|Ludwig von Köchel]]. It has since been repeatedly updated, as scholarly research improves knowledge of the dates and authenticity of individual works.{{sfn|Zaslaw|Cowdery|1990|pp=331–332}}

His most famous pupil, whom the Mozarts took into their Vienna home for two years as a child, was probably [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel]], a [[Transition from Classical to Romantic music|transitional figure]] between the Classical and Romantic eras.<ref>{{harvnb|Solomon|1995|p=574}}</ref> More important is the influence Mozart had on composers of later generations. Ever since the surge in his reputation after his death, studying his scores has been a standard part of classical musicians' training.<ref>See, for example: Temperley, Nicholas. "Mozart's Influence on English Music". ''[[Music & Letters]]'' 42.4 (1961): 307–318.</ref>

[[Ludwig van Beethoven]], Mozart's junior by fifteen years, was deeply influenced by his work, with which he was acquainted as a teenager.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lifeofmozart03jahn|title=Life of Mozart|last1=Jahn|first1=Otto|author-link1=Otto Jahn|last2=Townsend|first2=Pauline D.|last3=Grove|first3=George|author-link3=George Grove|year=1882|publisher=London, Novello, Ewer & Co.}}</ref> He is thought to have performed Mozart's operas while playing in the court orchestra at Bonn<ref>{{harvnb|''Raptus Association for Music Appreciation''}}</ref> and travelled to Vienna in 1787 hoping to study with the older composer. Some of [[List of compositions by Ludwig van Beethoven#Instrumental works: WoO 1–86|Beethoven's works]] have direct models in comparable works by Mozart, and he wrote [[cadenza]]s ([[WoO]]&nbsp;58) to Mozart's D minor piano concerto [[Piano Concerto No. 20 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;466]]. For further details, see [[Beethoven and Mozart]].

[[File:Frankfurt, Mozartdenkmal.jpg|thumb|upright|{{ill|Mozart Monument, Frankfurt|de|Mozart-Denkmal (Frankfurt am Main)|lt=Mozart Monument}}, Mozartplatz, Frankfurt]]

Composers have paid homage to Mozart by writing sets of [[Variation (music)|variations]] on his themes. Beethoven wrote four such sets (Op.&nbsp;66, WoO&nbsp;28, WoO&nbsp;40, WoO&nbsp;46). Others include [[Fernando Sor]]'s [[Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart (Sor)|Introduction and Variations on a Theme by Mozart]] (1821), [[Mikhail Glinka]]'s Variations on a Theme from Mozart's Opera "[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]" (1822), [[Frédéric Chopin]]'s [[Variations on "Là ci darem la mano" (Chopin)|Variations on "Là ci darem la mano"]] from ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' (1827), and [[Max Reger]]'s [[Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Mozart]] (1914), based on the variation theme in the piano sonata [[Piano Sonata No. 11 (Mozart)|K.&nbsp;331]].<ref>{{harvnb|March|Greenfield|Layton|2005}}</ref>

[[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] wrote his Orchestral Suite No.&nbsp;4 in G, ''[[Orchestral Suite No. 4 Mozartiana (Tchaikovsky)|Mozartiana]]'' (1887), as a tribute to Mozart.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Wiley |first=Roland John |author-link=Roland John Wiley |year=2001 |encyclopedia=[[Grove Music Online]] |title=Tchaikovsky, Pyotr Il′yich |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford|doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.51766}} {{Grove Music subscription}}</ref>
