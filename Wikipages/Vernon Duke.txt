==Early life==
'''Vladimir Aleksandrovich Dukelsky''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Владимир Александрович Дукельский) was born in 1903 into a noble family of mixed [[Georgia (country)|Georgian]]-[[Austrians|Austrian]]-[[Spain|Spanish]]-Russian descent, in [[Parafianovka village]], [[Pskov Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  The 1954 ''[[Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' referred to "one of his grandparents" (Princess [[Tumanishvili]]) as having been "directly descended from the kings of Georgia". His birthplace was a small railroad station in [[Minsk Governorate]]. At the time, his mother "happened to be traveling by train".<ref>Vernon Duke. ''Passport to Paris'', Boston-Toronto: Little, Brown and Co., 1955, p. 6.</ref> The Dukelskys resided in [[Kiev]], and Vladimir's only visit to [[Saint Petersburg]] and [[Moscow]] occurred in the summer of 1915. The impressions of that remarkable summer were later echoed in Dukelsky's most daring classical composition, the Russian [[oratorio]] ''The End of St. Petersburg'' (1931–37).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The title is a reference to the film [[The End of St. Petersburg]], directed by [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]]. He was [[Jewish]].<ref>{{cite web|title=How Many Famous Jewish Composers Can You Name? |url=https://jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com|website=Jewishstandard.timesofisrael.com}}</ref>

At the age of eleven, Dukelsky was admitted to the [[Kiev Conservatory]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> where he studied [[composer|composition]] with [[Reinhold Glière]] and [[musical theory]] with [[Boleslav Yavorsky]]. In 1919, his family escaped from the turmoil of [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] in Russia and spent a year and a half with other refugees in [[Constantinople]]. In 1921, they obtained American visas and sailed steerage class on the SS ''King Alexander'' to [[New York City|New York]].

He underwent his immigration inspection at [[Ellis Island]]. On the passenger list, the [[purser]] of the ''King Alexander'' recorded his name as ''Vladimir Doukelsky,'' in the [[France|French]] fashion. In 1922 in New York, [[George Gershwin]] befriended the young immigrant. Gershwin ( born Jacob Gershowitz) suggested that Dukelsky truncate and Americanize his name. Dukelsky's first songs published under his [[nom de plume]] were conceived that year, but he continued to write classical music and Russian [[poetry]] under his birth name until 1955.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

==Career==
In 1924, the restless young man left  America for the Old World. In [[Paris]], he received a [[commission (art)|commission]] from [[Sergei Diaghilev|Serge Diaghilev]] to compose a [[ballet]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Dukelsky's first theatrical production, ''Zephyr and Flora'', was staged in the 1925 season of [[Ballets Russes]], with [[choreography]] by [[Léonide Massine]] and [[scenography]] by [[Georges Braque]], to great critical acclaim. In a review of musical novelties of the season, [[Sergei Prokofiev]] described it as full of "superior melodies, very well designed, harmonically beautiful and not too 'modernist'."{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} Prokofiev was as impressed with the young talent as Diaghilev was, and soon the composers became close friends. They frequently saw each other until the end of the 1930s, and corresponded until 1946, when the attacks of Soviet officialdom on Prokofiev (who returned to Russia in 1938, although Duke urged him not to go) made further exchange of letters too dangerous for Prokofiev. Dukelsky's First Symphony was premiered by [[Sergei Koussevitzky|Serge Koussevitzky]] and his orchestra in 1928 in Paris on the same bill as excerpts from Prokofiev's ''[[The Fiery Angel (opera)|The Fiery Angel]]''. Some of Dukelsky's and Prokofiev's compositions of the 1930s bear evidence of their musical dialogue.

In the late 1920s, Dukelsky divided his time between Paris, where his more classical works were performed, and [[London]], where he composed numbers for musical comedies under the pen name Vernon Duke.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1929, he returned to the United States with the intention of settling in the country permanently.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He composed and published much serious music, but devoted greater efforts to establishing himself on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]. Duke's songs "[[April in Paris (song)|April in Paris]]" (1932), "[[Autumn in New York (song)|Autumn in New York]]" (1934), "I Like the Likes of You" (1934), "Water Under the Bridge" (1934), and "[[I Can't Get Started]]" (1936) were 1930s hits.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

The support and devotion of Serge Koussevitzky, who published Dukelsky's [[chamber music]] and conducted his orchestral scores, helped him develop his classical works. Dukelsky's [[concerto]] for [[piano]], orchestra, and [[soprano]] [[obbligato]], titled ''Dédicaces'' (1935–1937), was premièred by Koussevitzky and the [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]] in January 1939 in New York. His oratorio, ''The End of St. Petersburg'', was premiered a year earlier by [[MacDowell Club#MacDowell Chorus|Schola Cantorum]] and the [[New York Philharmonic]] under [[Hugh Ross (musician)|Hugh Ross]]. In 1937, the composer was asked to complete Gershwin's last score, a [[Film score|soundtrack]] to a [[Technicolor]] extravaganza ''[[The Goldwyn Follies]]'', to which he contributed two [[parody]] ballets choreographed by [[George Balanchine]], and the song "Spring Again". In 1939, Dukelsky became an American citizen and took Vernon Duke as his legal name. Duke's greatest success came a year later, with the Broadway musical ''Cabin in the Sky'' (1940), choreographed by [[George Balanchine]] and performed by an [[African American|all-black]] cast at the [[Martin Beck Theater]] in New York.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

===Military service===
Between 1942 and 1944, he served in the [[United States Coast Guard|US Coast Guard]]. While in service, he discovered [[Sid Caesar]], a [[saxophone]] player in the Coast Guard Band, and wrote a touring show for the Coast Guard called ''[[Tars & Spars]]''. He also conceived some of his finest music in the classical tradition, including a Cello Concerto (commissioned by [[Gregor Piatigorsky]]) and a Violin Concerto.

===Third Symphony===
His pensive Third Symphony (1946) was dedicated to the memory of Koussevitzky's wife, Natalie. Over the years, Serge and Natalie Koussevitzky, Dukelsky's devoted supporters, had become his surrogate family. When Dukelsky's mother died, in 1942, the composer took the conductor's refusal to commission the work with great bitterness. The dedication was revoked and the relationship soured.

In 1946, Duke left the United States for France, where he continued his double career of being a classical composer and a songwriter (now setting to music the texts of French lyricists).<ref name="LarkinGE"/> By 1948, the composer was back in America. He moved from New York to [[California]], where he spent his last decades writing songs, film and theater scores, chamber music, poetry in Russian and polemical articles and memoirs in English.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> On October 30, 1957, he married singer Kay McCracken. His final appearance on Broadway came less than two weeks later with the two songs and incidental music he wrote for the [[Helen Hayes]] show, [[Jean Anouilh]]'s ''Time Remembered'' (1940) (French title: ''[[Léocadia]]'') which ran for 247 performances. He continued to try to mount Broadway musicals during the last decade of his life, including two shows that closed during tryouts, and one that was never produced.

===Later works===
As a classical composer, Dukelsky used the same musical language as his modernist contemporaries [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Arthur Lourié]], and, to a lesser extent, [[Igor Stravinsky]]. His harmonies, however, were highly original. As a songwriter and author of theatrical and film music, his work was close to [[George Gershwin|that of George Gershwin]] and [[Harold Arlen]], but he developed an idiosyncratic voice of his own.

==Death==
Duke died in [[Santa Monica, California]] on 16 January 1969,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> during surgery for [[lung cancer]]. His numerous papers—musical and literary manuscripts and correspondence in English, French, and Russian—are stored in the Musical Division of the [[Library of Congress]].
