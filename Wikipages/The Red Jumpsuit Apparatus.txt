'''The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band that was formed in [[Middleburg, Florida]], in 2003.<ref name=AM/> The  band has released five studio albums to date. The current members are Ronnie Winter (lead vocals), Joey Westwood (bass), Josh Burke (lead guitar), Randy Winter (rhythm guitar), Daniel Resnick (keys) and John Espy (drums).

The band is best known for the material from their 2006 major-label release ''[[Don't You Fake It]]''. The lead single "[[Face Down (The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus song)|Face Down]]" became their biggest success, and "False Pretense" and "[[Your Guardian Angel]]" were strong follow-up hits for the band. ''Don't You Fake It'' is the band's only [[RIAA]]-certified record, and all of its singles have also received awards from the institution.

==History==

===2003–2004: Early years===
Originating in Florida, childhood friends Ronnie Winter and Duke Kitchens started the band while attending an [[AP Music Theory]] class in 2001.<ref name="arizona1">[http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/90420?q=Red+Jumpsuit+Apparatus&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1#firsthit ]{{dead link|date=May 2018}}</ref> The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus was officially formed in 2003 after the addition of other members who were then in other bands. The band name was chosen by the band voting for random words they threw on a wall.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus – Interview with Vocalist Ronnie Winter |url=http://www.ampmagazine.com/4739/the-red-jumpsuit-apparatus-interview-with-vocalist-ronnie-winter/ |date=7 October 2010 |access-date=24 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213073450/http://www.ampmagazine.com/4739/the-red-jumpsuit-apparatus-interview-with-vocalist-ronnie-winter/ |archive-date=13 December 2010}}</ref>

The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus worked with Vision Sound studios in Orange Park, Florida, which released a "6 song EP CD that was spread throughout different countries to promote the band in 2005".<ref name="arizona1"/> The band began to become more popular as they used certain social media, namely Myspace, to advertise their music.<ref name="arizona1"/> While popular in their local scene, the band found it difficult to secure label support. This is why the band took 18 months to write songs before going into the live scene.<ref name="arizona1"/> They built a fan base with continued live shows, which attracted the attention of Jason Flom of Virgin Records in 2005, after which they began work on their first album.<ref name="arizona1"/>

===2005–2007: ''Don't You Fake It''===
In 2006, they released their first [[album|LP]], ''Don't You Fake It'', with the singles "Face Down," "False Pretense", "[[Your Guardian Angel]]", and "[[Damn Regret]]".

The album was certified gold on November 27, 2006 by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for sales shipments exceeding 500,000 copies.<ref name="prnewswire">{{cite news |title=The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus Turns Gold: "Don't You Fake It" Is Certified Gold |url=http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=/www/story/11-27-2006/0004480465&EDATE= |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Virgin Records |date=27 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329122941/http://www2.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F11-27-2006%2F0004480465&EDATE= |archive-date=29 March 2012 }}</ref>

In a 2007 interview with the ''Florida Entertainment Scene'', The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus teamed up with [[Virgin Records]] to raise funds for the [[National Coalition Against Domestic Violence]]. They also headlined the [[Take Action Tour|Take Action! Tour]], which sponsors awareness against teen suicide, animal cruelty, and domestic violence.

===2008–2009: ''Lonely Road''===
In June 2007, according to Billboard.com, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus began to work on their second album, ''[[Lonely Road (The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus album)|Lonely Road]]'', that had a tentative release date of summer 2008.<ref name="billboard">[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1051284/red-jumpsuit-apparatus-hoarding-new-songs Red Jumpsuit Apparatus Hoarding New Songs], Billboard.com</ref> The band was then pulled out of their confirmed appearances at the Australian [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave festival]] tour 2008, after their label president promised to pay money that was owed and have the band in the studio, but instead didn't pull through.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

In April 2008, the band began an acoustic tour on the east coast in various locations with the group Amaru, who is from the same home town. Ronnie said that the tour felt like they were "Getting back where we all started."

After pulling out of the 2008 [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave festival]], the band took part in the line-up for 2009.

On September 30, 2008, the band announced in a [[Myspace]] blog post that on October 3 they would be premiering a demo version of a song from the upcoming album. The song was available a day earlier for members of The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus "Alliance" fan group. However, the studio of the song "Pen and Paper" was released to members of the fan group on October 9, and was released on the band's Myspace the following day. Another song, "You Better Pray", the first single from ''Lonely Road'', was premiered worldwide on PlanetRadio1073.com for free listening beginning on October 21{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} and began streaming the next day on the band's Myspace page.

Their second studio album, titled ''[[Lonely Road (The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus album)|Lonely Road]]'',<ref name="komodorock">[http://www.komodorock.com/new-release-news/cd-releases/the-red-jumpsuit-apparatus-to-release-lonely-road-in-february-200811219598/ The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus To Release Lonely Road In February] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204074502/http://www.komodorock.com/new-release-news/cd-releases/the-red-jumpsuit-apparatus-to-release-lonely-road-in-february-200811219598/ |date=2009-02-04 }}, Komodo Rock.com</ref> was released on February 3, debuting in the fourteenth spot on [[The Billboard 200|the ''Billboard'' 200]], and was produced by Howard Benson ([[My Chemical Romance]], [[Daughtry (band)|Daughtry]], [[Less Than Jake]], [[Hoobastank]], [[P.O.D.]], [[The All-American Rejects]], [[Seether]], and [[Cold (band)|Cold]]).

Beginning in October 2008, Matt Carter had replaced former guitar player Elias Reidy. Carter had worked as a tech for the band in the winter and spring of 2008, and had jammed with the band a few years previously. Now, Carter was asked to take Reidy's spot, and he agreed to play with The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus. In an interview with a Jacksonville newspaper, Ronnie was asked whether Carter was officially in the band, to which he responded, "I don't know. I guess he's in the band. We're taking it slow." Carter played with the band from then on.<ref name="jacksonville times-union">[http://jacksonville.com/entertainment/music/2009-01-30/story/ready_to_hit_the_lonely_road/ Red Jumpsuit Apparatus releases new CD today, performs tonight], Jacksonville.com</ref>

In support of this album, the band went on many tours in the winter of 2008 and the spring of 2009 with bands such as [[Shinedown]], [[Framing Hanley]], and [[Tickle Me Pink]].

On March 20, 2009, Red Jumpsuit Apparatus released an EP titled ''Shock Session'', featuring acoustic versions of "Pen & Paper", "You Better Pray", and "Face Down".

At the end of May 2009, they announced along with [[Hollywood Undead]], [[Mest]], and [[The Sleeping]] that they would be doing a summer tour for the months of June and July, playing mostly club and small venue shows. They rejoined [[Monty Are I]] for an August 2009 tour throughout Canada and California.

===2010–2012: ''The Hell or High Water EP'' and ''Am I the Enemy''===
On January 29, 2010, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus announced via their Twitter page that they would have a new EP out in late July/August.

In February 2010, the band parted ways with their label [[Virgin Records]], citing the poor promotion of ''[[Lonely Road (The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus album)|Lonely Road]]''. They decided to release music independently. According to lead singer Ronnie Winter, "At this point we want to stay completely 100% independent for as long as possible."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lazyrocker.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=539:red-jumpsuit-apparatus-goes-independent |title=Red Jumpsuit Apparatus Goes Independent |publisher=Lazyrocker.com |date=2010-07-12 |access-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305115612/http://www.lazyrocker.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=539:red-jumpsuit-apparatus-goes-independent |archive-date=2012-03-05 }}</ref> The first such song was "Valentine," which was released for free on Valentine's Day, February 14, 2010.

On June 22, 2010, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus announced via [[Myspace]] blog that their upcoming EP release would be titled ''The Hell or High Water'', and that the first song from it, "Choke", would be released on June 28, 2010 as a free download. The EP was recorded in the band's studio in Middleburg, Florida, and was mixed and mastered by Paul Lapinski.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=4654367&blogId=536186505 |title=The Skinny van The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus op Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=2010-06-22 |access-date=2012-03-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710024057/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=4654367&blogId=536186505 |archive-date=2012-07-10 }}</ref> This was their first release following their departure from Virgin Records, and was released on August 24, 2010.

The music video for the first single from the EP, "Choke", premiered at purevolume.com on August 25, 2010 in support of the EP's release. It was the first of a three-part series, followed by "Don't Hate" and "Hell or High Water". It shows characters killing record executive-type personnel, running from the police, and then dying in the final video. Its moral was "violence never solves anything".

In November 2010, The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus entered the studio to record their third full-length album, ''[[Am I the Enemy]]'', finishing in December 2010 with producer John Feldmann.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/redjumpsuitapparatus/posts/114325485294857 |title=<<>> The... |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> The album's first single, "Reap", was released via YouTube on March 24, although the song itself was not released to [[iTunes]] until April 26.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/news/9371/red-jumpsuit-apparatus-release-new-song/ |title=Red Jumpsuit Apparatus release new song &#124; News |publisher=Kill Your Stereo |date=2011-03-24 |access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus later released two other songs from their new album on their YouTube channel, "Salvation" and "Fall from Grace".

On July 11, 2011, lead singer Ronnie Winter announced that guitarists Duke Kitchens and Matt Carter had left the band "to focus on their personal lives", and longtime Red Jumpsuit Apparatus fan Josh Burke joined as lead guitarist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_duke_kitchens_and_matt_carter_leave_red_jumpsuit_apparatus/ |title=Alternative Press &#124; News &#124; Exclusive: A note from Ronnie Winter about Red Jumpsuit Apparatus changes |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2011-07-11 |access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> This was followed by a YouTube video on July 17 welcoming Burke as the official lead guitarist of the band, replacing Carter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2joVqcL3F8 |title=The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus welcomes Josh Burke |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-07-17 |access-date=2012-03-31}}</ref> Ronnie's brother, Randy Winter, was later added as the second guitarist, filling in for Duke Kitchens.

In mid-October, drummer Jon Wilkes decided to depart from the band in order to "pursue new things and make a living" as a producer. According to Wilkes, he left the band on good terms and wished them the best in their future endeavors. He was temporarily replaced by Kristopher Comeaux while the band was touring, but Comeaux departed shortly after.
