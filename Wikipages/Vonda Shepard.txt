==Life and career==
Vonda Shepard was born in [[New York City]] in 1963.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Her family relocated to [[California]] when she was a child. She played piano from an early age. Her father was [[Richmond Shepard]], a [[mime]] and improvisational actor. She has three sisters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005423/bio|title=Vonda Shepard|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>

Vonda has released 15 albums, including eight solo albums, three live albums and four albums for ''Ally McBeal''.  

Throughout her career she has played keyboards and has sung with [[Jackson Browne]], [[Al Jarreau]], and [[Rickie Lee Jones]].<ref name="Larkin90"/>  

Vonda has sold over 12 million albums and has won two Golden Globes, two Emmy awards and two Screen Actors Guild awards and the ''Billboard'' award for selling the most television soundtrack albums in history.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}  

While on ''Ally McBeal'', Vonda was the “behind the scenes” music producer, producing over 500 songs for the artists [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Robert Downey Jr.|Robert Downey Jr]]., [[Gladys Knight]], [[Chubby Checker]], [[Al Green]], [[Randy Newman]] and many more.  

Vonda continues to tour the world, playing her original material and songs from her days on ''Ally McBeal''.  Her latest album is titled ''Rookie'', and she is currently writing her next album.  

After performing as a backing singer for many years, she eventually got her own recording contract. Vonda's first chart appearance was in 1987, when she recorded a duet with [[Dan Hill]] entitled "[[Can't We Try]]." Before this, she had tried out for the part of [[Michael J. Fox]]'s sister in ''[[Light of Day]],'' but she lost the part to [[Joan Jett]]. She was also poised to sing on [[Peter Cetera]]'s duet "The Next Time I Fall," but he picked [[Amy Grant]] instead. She released her first self-titled album in 1989, but with little fanfare. The album did yield one chart single, "Don't Cry Ilene," a middle-tempo piano-driven jazz-R&B flavored song dealing with the break-up of a relationship between a black woman and a white man, arising from adult peer pressure. The track is sung from the perspective of the woman's white female friend, who harbors a desire to have the man for herself, but keeps her distance out of respect for her friend. The song peaked at Number 17 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary chart and stayed on the charts for 12 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/adult-contemporary|title=Adult Contemporary Music Chart|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2019-12-19}}</ref>

After her third album, Vonda was signed up to appear on ''Ally McBeal'' after the show's creator, former attorney [[David E. Kelley]], spotted her performing in a nightclub.<ref name="Larkin90"/> While on the show she recorded two full soundtrack albums and was featured on two other ''Ally McBeal'' compilations.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The songs that Shepard recorded for the ''Ally McBeal'' soundtrack albums were mainly covers of old songs with lyrics that paralleled what was happening in the title character's life on-screen.<ref name="Larkin90"/> However, "Searchin' My Soul," which became the album's biggest hit single after Kelley chose it for the show's titles theme, was an original selection jointly written and composed by Vonda and [[Paul Gordon (composer)|Paul Howard Gordon]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> Since her appearances in the show, Vonda has released two more studio albums and a live album.

She married music producer [[Mitchell Froom]] in 2004; they had their first child in 2006. She is also the stepmother to Froom's daughter, Ruby, from his marriage to [[Suzanne Vega]].

She provided vocals for "I Need You," whose music had been composed by [[James Newton Howard]], for the 2010 film ''[[Love & Other Drugs]],'' which starred [[Jake Gyllenhaal]] and [[Anne Hathaway]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}
