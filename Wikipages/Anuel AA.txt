'''Emmanuel Gazmey Santiago''' (born November 26, 1992), known professionally as '''Anuel AA''', is a Puerto Rican rapper and singer. His music often contains samples and interpolations of songs that were popular during his youth. He is seen as a controversial figure in the Latin music scene for his legal troubles and feuds with fellow Puerto Rican rappers [[Cosculluela]] and [[Ivy Queen]] and with the American rapper [[6ix9ine]].

Raised in [[Carolina, Puerto Rico]], he started recording music at age fourteen and began posting it online four years later in 2010, before eventually signing to the Latin division of American rapper [[Rick Ross]]'s [[Maybach Music Group]]. His 2016 [[mixtape]] ''Real Hasta la Muerte'' was well-received, but his success was put on hold the same year by a 30-month prison sentence for illegal firearm possession in Puerto Rico. He recorded the entirety of his debut album while incarcerated, during which time his genre of music surged in popularity.

Anuel AA released his debut album, also titled ''[[Real Hasta la Muerte]]'', on July 17, 2018, the day he was released from prison. The album was a critical and commercial success. In the coming six months, he appeared on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Latin Songs]], solidifying his position as one of the top Latino artists. In August 2019, he released the song "[[China (Anuel AA song)|China]]", a collaboration with [[Daddy Yankee]], [[Karol G]], [[Ozuna (singer)|Ozuna]], and [[J Balvin]], which was a global success. He has since released the hit song "[[Me Gusta (Shakira and Anuel AA song)|Me Gusta]]" with [[Shakira]], and his second album, ''[[Emmanuel (album)|Emmanuel]]'', which was released on May 29, 2020. In November 2020, Anuel AA made a statement on [[Instagram]] and released a new song suggesting his imminent retirement from the music industry, citing family and relationship issues. He was back to music with his collaborative album ''[[Los Dioses]]'' with [[Ozuna]]. His third studio album ''[[Las Leyendas Nunca Mueren]]'' is released in 26 November 2021, including 16 tracks.

According to ''XXL'', Anuel AA is considered "one of the founding fathers of Latin trap music".<ref name="xxl"/> He is noted for his signature "BRRR" adlib, which is meant to mimic the sound of an [[automatic firearm]].<ref name=obsessedvice/> Anuel AA's lyrics often discuss sex, crime, and life on the streets.<ref name=allmusicbio/> Paul Simpson of [[Allmusic]] described his lyrics as "too risqué to be played on the radio" and highlighted that his success has instead stemmed from streaming services and the artist's highly active social media presence.<ref name=allmusicbio/> Gary Suarez of ''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]'' viewed his 2018 album ''Real Hasta la Muerte'' as a collection of both "gleaming trap bangers" and "reggaeton crowd pleasers".<ref name=notoriousreturn/> Despite his "bad guy image", Suarez wrote that the relationship-themed songs "[[Culpables (Karol G and Anuel AA song)|Culpables]]" and "Secreto" represent "a softening of his hardened trapero persona".<ref name=successstory/> Anuel AA is noted for his use of the word "bebecita" ("baby girl") in songs and on social media, and the word has become associated with the reggaeton genre as well as Anuel AA and Karol G's relationship.<ref name=slang>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8548251/reggaeton-lyrics-decoding-slang-meaning|title=Reggaeton Slang 101: Decoding the Lyrics in Latin Urban Music|work=Billboard|date=January 16, 2020|access-date=May 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name=bebecita>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8498328/urban-artists-reggaeton-love-songs|title=From 'Vaina Loca' to 'Bebesita,' How Urban Artists Declare Their Love in Reggaeton Songs|work=Billboard|date=February 13, 2019|access-date=May 4, 2020}}</ref>

Anuel AA's introduction to [[hip-hop]] occurred upon listening to rapper [[Tupac Shakur]].<ref name="xxl"/> His songs frequently pay homage to both U.S. and Latin artists that influenced him in his youth. Examples include "China" which samples both "It Wasn't Me" by Shaggy and "Ella Me Levantó" by Daddy Yankee, and "Delincuente" which interpolates "Bandoleros" by [[Don Omar]] and [[Tego Calderón]].<ref name=oldschool>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8523581/anuel-aa-farruko-latin-artists-reviving-old-school-reggaeton|title= Anuel AA, Farruko & More Urban Artists Revive Old-School Reggaeton Hits: See the List|work=Billboard|date=July 23, 2019|access-date=May 4, 2020}}</ref> He is influenced by, and has collaborated with, American hip-hop artists [[Meek Mill]] and [[Gucci Mane]], both of whom, like Anuel AA, gained notoriety for serving time in prison.<ref name=notoriousreturn/> Describing Meek Mill's impact on his music, Anuel AA explained, "I listen to what people say in the songs, not just the melodies. With rappers you gotta listen to what they say. And Meek be talking some real shit. That's why I look up to him."<ref name="xxl"/> In an interview with ''Vice'', he expressed admiration for the music of bachata artist [[Zacarías Ferreíra]], Dominican dembow rapper [[El Alfa]], and English singer-songwriter [[Ed Sheeran]].<ref name=obsessedvice/> He has also indicated an interest in collaborating with [[Post Malone]] and [[Billie Eilish]].<ref name="xxl"/>

==Controversies==
On September 15, 2018, Anuel AA released a [[Diss (music)|diss track]] called "Intocable" aimed at fellow rapper [[Cosculluela]]. The track was widely criticized due to its profanity and remarks about homosexuality and [[HIV/AIDS]] patients.<ref name="Billboard1">{{cite news |title=Anuel AA Apologizes For Offensive Song Directed at Cosculluela: Watch |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8474986/anuel-aa-apologizes-offensive-song-cosculluela |last=Fernandez|first=Suzette|work=Billboard|access-date=December 29, 2018 |date=September 13, 2018}}</ref> In the song, he refers to model and television host [[Taina (model)|La Taína]] as a "pig" for her [[HIV-positive people|HIV-positive status]].<ref name=cosulluelaapology>{{cite web|url=https://remezcla.com/music/anuel-aa-cosculluela-apology-tiraera-beef/|title=Anuel AA Apologizes for Homophobic Diss Track: "This Has Been My Biggest Mistake"|last=Arroyo|first=Juan J.|website=Remezcla|date=September 13, 2018|access-date=April 16, 2020}}</ref> Due to the public backlash, Anuel AA's concert at the [[José Miguel Agrelot Coliseum|Coliseo de Puerto Rico]] venue, scheduled for October 12 of that year, was canceled by his production staff and main producer Paco López. Anuel AA later issued an apology for the song.<ref name=secretoleaked/><ref name="Billboard1"/> He explained, "It is the worst mistake of my career. I do not need this and I apologize to all the people I offended. To homosexuals, to people with AIDS, to La Taina [the model] and to those who lost everything after Hurricane Maria ... My fans deserve from me to be a better person, and I apologize to everyone in Puerto Rico."<ref name="Billboard1"/>

In early April 2019, Anuel AA and [[Ivy Queen]] engaged in an argument on [[Instagram]] after Anuel AA questioned how Ivy Queen could be still considered the "Queen of Reggaeton."
