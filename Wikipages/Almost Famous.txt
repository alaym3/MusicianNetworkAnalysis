'''''Almost Famous''''' is a 2000 American [[comedy-drama]] film written and directed by [[Cameron Crowe]] and starring [[Billy Crudup]], [[Frances McDormand]], [[Kate Hudson]], and [[Patrick Fugit]]. It tells the story of a teenage journalist writing for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' in the early 1970s, his touring with the fictitious [[rock music|rock]] band Stillwater, and his efforts to get his first cover story published.

The film is semi-autobiographical, as Crowe himself was a teenage writer for ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>[http://www.theuncool.com/bio/ "Biography,"] The Uncool: The Official Website for Everything Cameron Crowe. Accessed Dec. 14, 2014.</ref>

The film received widespread acclaim from critics and received four [[Academy Awards]] nominations, including a win for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]]. It was also awarded the 2001 [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]]. [[Roger Ebert]] hailed it the best film of the year as well as the ninth-best film of the 2000s. It also won two [[Golden Globe Awards]], for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy]] and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture]] (Hudson). In a 2016 international poll conducted by [[BBC]], ''Almost Famous'' was ranked the 79th greatest film since 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films |title=The 21st century's 100 greatest films |publisher=BBC |date=August 23, 2016 |access-date=January 12, 2017}}</ref> In a Hollywood Reporter 2014 list voted on by "studio chiefs, Oscar winners and TV royalty", ''Almost Famous'' was ranked the 71st greatest film of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=25 June 2014|title=Hollywood's 100 Favorite Films|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/100-best-films-ever-hollywood-favorites-818512/item/almost-famous-hollywoods-100-favorite-818448|url-status=live|website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref> In 2020, Crowe said he was working on a stage musical adaptation of the movie.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=Martoccio|first=Angie|date=20 August 2020|title=Cameron Crowe on the 20th Anniversary of 'Almost Famous': 'It's Never Been as Popular as It Is Now'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-features/almost-famous-20th-anniversary-cameron-crowe-interview-1041826/|url-access=subscription|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[Rolling Stone]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Plot==
<!-- Please review [[WP:FILMPLOT]] before adding material. The plot summary should be between 400 and 700 words. -->
In [[San Diego]] 1969, child prodigy William Miller struggles to fit in. His life is further complicated after learning that his widowed college-professor mother Elaine has falsely led him to believe he is twelve years old. William is actually eleven, having started the first grade at five years old, and skipping fifth grade. Strong-willed Elaine's strict ban on [[rock music]] and her fear of pop culture have a negative effect on her children, finally driving William's 18-year-old sister Anita to move to [[San Francisco]] and become a flight attendant.

In 1973, William, now fifteen, influenced by Anita's secret cache of rock albums, aspires to be a rock journalist, writing freelance articles for underground papers in [[San Diego]]. Rock journalist [[Lester Bangs]], impressed with William's writing, gives him a $35 assignment to review a [[Black Sabbath]] concert. William is barred from backstage until the opening band Stillwater arrives and William flatters his way in. Lead guitarist Russell Hammond takes a liking to him and his new acquaintance, veteran [[groupie]] Penny Lane, who has taken William under her wing. Despite behaving as stereotypical groupies, Penny Lane insists she and her friends are "band aids", a term she invented to describe female fans that are there more for the music than for the rock stars themselves.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editor [[Ben Fong-Torres]] hires William to write an article about Stillwater, based on his skills, and sends him on the road with the band. William interviews the other band members, but Russell repeatedly puts him off. Tensions between Russell and lead singer Jeff Bebe soon become evident and not helped at all by the band's first t-shirt, a full band shot that pictures Russell in full view while the rest of the band is in the shadows. William is jokingly called "the enemy" by the band as he is a journalist, but all the same begins to lose his objectivity as he becomes integrated into their inner circle.

The record label hires Dennis, a professional manager, to handle problems with venues and promoters. Penny has to leave before the band reaches New York, where Russell's girlfriend Leslie will join them. Penny and her three protégée band aids are gambled away to another band in a poker game; Penny acts nonchalant but is devastated. Meanwhile, Dennis charters a small plane so the band can play more gigs.

Penny shows up uninvited at the New York restaurant where they are celebrating the news that they are to be featured on the cover of ''Rolling Stone''. Penny is asked to leave after Leslie notices her attempts to get Russell's attention. William chases her to her hotel, where he saves her from overdosing on [[methaqualone|quaaludes]].

Flying to a gig the following day, the plane encounters severe weather. Fearing the plane will crash, everyone confesses their secrets, while Jeff and Russell's long-simmering conflicts erupt. William confesses his love for Penny after Jeff insults her. The plane lands safely in [[Tupelo, Mississippi|Tupelo]], leaving everyone to ponder the changed atmosphere.

William arrives at the ''Rolling Stone'' office in San Francisco but has difficulty finishing the article. Seeking help, he calls Lester Bangs who says William got caught up in being part of the band. He says his perceived friendships with them are not real and advises him to "be honest...and unmerciful." ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s editors rave over William's completed article, but when the magazine's fact checker calls the band, Russell lies to protect Stillwater's image and claims most of it is false. ''Rolling Stone'' kills the article, crushing William. Anita encounters a dejected William in the airport and offers to take him anywhere; he chooses for them to go to their home in San Diego.

"Band aid" Sapphire chastises Russell for betraying William. He then calls Penny, wanting to meet with her, but she gives him William's address. He arrives and finds himself face-to-face with William's mother who, during the tour, scolded him over the phone for his behavior. Russell apologizes to William and finally gives him an interview. Russell has verified William's article to ''Rolling Stone'', which runs it as a cover feature. Penny fulfills her long-standing fantasy to go to Morocco while Stillwater tours again by bus.

==Production==
Crowe used a composite of the bands he had known to create Stillwater, the emerging group that welcomes the young journalist into its sphere, then becomes wary of his intentions. "Stillwater" was the name of [[Stillwater (band)|a real band]] signed to Macon, Georgia's [[Capricorn Records]] label, which required the film's producers to obtain permission to use the name. In an interview, real Stillwater guitarist Bobby Golden said, "They could have probably done it without permission but they probably would have had a bunch of different lawsuits. Our lawyer got in touch with them. They wanted us to do it for free and I said, 'No we're not doing it for free.' So we got a little bit of change out of it."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Golden|first=Bobby|title=Stillwater Interview|url=http://phantomphotography.com/interviews/stillwater-interview/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170518023519/http://phantomphotography.com/interviews/stillwater-interview/|archive-date=18 May 2017|website=Phantom Photography}}</ref> Seventies rocker [[Peter Frampton]] served as a technical consultant on the film. Crowe and his then-wife, musician [[Nancy Wilson (guitarist)|Nancy Wilson]] of [[Heart (band)|Heart]], co-wrote three of the five Stillwater songs in the film, and Frampton wrote the other two, with [[Mike McCready]] of [[Pearl Jam]] playing lead guitar on all of the Stillwater songs.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stillwater Secrets & Lies|url=https://www.theuncool.com/films/almost-famous/stillwater-secrets/|url-status=live|website=TheUncool.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-08-13|title=Nancy Wilson On Teaching Billy Crudup About LSD For ‘Almost Famous’|url=https://uproxx.com/movies/nancy-wilson-interview-heart-almost-famous/|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[UPROXX]]|language=en-US}}</ref>

The character of Russell Hammond was originally set to be played by [[Brad Pitt]]. But during rehearsal prior to filming, Crowe and Pitt mutually decided that it was “not the right fit”, and Pitt dropped out of the project. The line “I am a Golden God!” in the pool-jumping sequence, as well as numerous references to Russell Hammond being unusually good looking, were written for Pitt, but remained in the script after Billy Crudup was cast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/almost-famous-brad-pitt-meryl-streep-natalie-portman-cast/|title = Almost Famous Nearly Starred Brad Pitt, Meryl Streep, Natalie Portman|date = 14 July 2020}}</ref><ref>The "I am a Golden God!" line is likely inspired by a real-life 1975 incident involving [[Led Zeppelin]]'s lead singer [[Robert Plant]].  See [https://www.petersimon.com/musicians/robert-plant-golden-god Peter Simon Photography] (referenced 1 April 2021).</ref>

Crowe based the character of Penny Lane on the real-life [[Pennie Lane Trumbull]] and her group of female promoters who called themselves the "Flying Garter Girls Group".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://oregonmusicnews.com/2012/09/07/will-the-real-penny-lane-please-stand-up/ |title=Will the real Penny Lane please stand up? |date=September 7, 2012 |last=Ammann |first=Ana |work=Oregon Music News |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907213033/http://oregonmusicnews.com/2012/09/07/will-the-real-penny-lane-please-stand-up/ |archive-date=September 7, 2015 }}</ref> Though they were not in the Flying Garter Girls group, various other women have been described as Crowe's inspiration, for instance [[Pamela Des Barres]]<ref>{{cite news|last=Lecaro|first=Lina|date=December 15, 2010|title=Zooey Deschanel to Play Original '60s Groupie Pamela "I'm With the Band" Des Barres in HBO Series (NSFW)|work=[[LA Weekly]]|url=https://www.laweekly.com/zooey-deschanel-to-play-original-60s-groupie-pamela-im-with-the-band-des-barres-in-hbo-series-nsfw/|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Bebe Buell]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Talk |title=Wild Things: Cameron Crowe and Bebe Buell |date=March 2001}}</ref> [[Sarah Polley]] was originally cast as Penny Lane but when Brad Pitt dropped out she dropped out as well and was replaced with Kate Hudson.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Martoccio|first=Angie|date=15 July 2020|title='Almost Famous' Podcast: 10 Things We Learned|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/almost-famous-podcast-kate-hudson-1028468/|url-status=live|access-date=|website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref>

The character of William Miller's mother (played by [[Frances McDormand]]) was based on Crowe's own mother, who even showed up on the set to keep an eye on him while he worked. Though he asked his mother not to bother McDormand, the two women ended up getting along well.<ref>Goldstein, Patrick (August 27, 2000).

It's Cameron Crowe's life story, and he's tried to tell it for years,"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]] —'' via The Uncool.com.</ref>

[[Alice in Chains]]' guitarist/vocalist [[Jerry Cantrell]] was Crowe's first choice for the role of Stillwater bass player Larry Fellows. Cantrell is friends with Crowe and had previously appeared in two films directed by him, ''[[Singles (1992 film)|Singles]]'' (1992) and ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' (1996). Cantrell was busy writing the songs for his solo album ''[[Degradation Trip]]'' and had to turn the role down. [[Mark Kozelek]] was cast instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sLTdrygi97Q|title=Alice in Chains' Jerry Cantrell almost starred in the movie 'Almost Famous' |work=YouTube|date=November 12, 2017|access-date=November 24, 2017}}</ref>

Crowe took a copy of the film to London for a special screening with [[Led Zeppelin]] members [[Jimmy Page]] and [[Robert Plant]]. After the screening, Led Zeppelin granted Crowe the right to use one of their songs on the soundtrack—the first time they had ever consented to this since allowing Crowe to use "[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]" in ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]''—and also gave him rights to four of their other songs in the movie itself, although they did not grant him the rights to "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" for an intended scene (on the special "Bootleg" edition DVD, the scene is included as an extra, sans the song, where the viewer is instructed by a watermark to begin playing it).<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite news|date=10 August 2000|title=This Time Cameron Crowe Gets Zeppelin for Movie Soundtrack|work=[[Rolling Stone ]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/movie-news/this-time-cameron-crowe-gets-zeppelin-for-movie-soundtrack-197204/|url-access=subscription}}</ref>

In his 2012 memoir ''My Cross to Bear'', [[Gregg Allman]] writes that several aspects of the movie are based on Crowe's time spent with the [[Allman Brothers Band]]. The scene in which Russell jumps from the top of the Topeka party house into a pool was based on something [[Duane Allman]] did: "the jumping off the roof into the pool, that was Duane—from the third floor of a place called the [[Travelodge]] in [[San Francisco]]. My brother wanted to do it again, but the cat who owned the place came out shaking his fist, yelling at him. We told that story all the time, and I have no doubt that Cameron was around for it." He also confirms that he and [[Dickey Betts]] played a joke on Crowe by claiming clauses in their contract did not allow his story to be published—just before he was to deliver it to ''Rolling Stone''.<ref>{{cite book|last1 = Allman|first1 = Gregg|last2 = Light|first2 = Alan| author-link = Alan Light|title = My Cross to Bear|url = https://archive.org/details/mycrosstobear00allm_0|url-access = registration|year = 2012|publisher = William Morrow|isbn = 978-0062112033|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mycrosstobear00allm_0/page/242 242–43]}}</ref>
