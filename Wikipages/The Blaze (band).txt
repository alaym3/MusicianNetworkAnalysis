'''The Blaze''' are the French [[Paris]]-based music and video duo Guillaume and Jonathan Alric. The duo are cousins who are mostly known for their cinematographic videos.

==Musical career==
Guillaume Alric and Jonathan Alric began making music together when Jonathan, who was at film school in [[Brussels]], asked Guillaume to work with him on a music video soundtrack.

As a duo they took the name The Blaze. They have explained that in addition to the strength and warmth suggested by the name, it means "name" in French slang.<ref>Aimee Cliff, "[https://www.thefader.com/2017/04/07/the-blaze-territory-interview Get To Know The Blaze, The French Duo Making Music Videos As Good As Movies]," The Fader, 7 April 2017 (retrieved 7 Aug 2018)</ref>

Their distinctive integrative method involves producing sound and visuals at the same time, creating an especially strong link between music and image.<ref>"[https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/French-Duo-The-Blaze-Announce-the-Release-of-New-Album-DANCEHALL-Out-September-7-20180629 French Duo The Blaze Announce the Release of New Album DANCEHALL Out September 7]," Broadway World, 29 June 2018 (retrieved 8 Aug 2018)</ref>
