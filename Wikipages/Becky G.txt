She first gained recognition in 2011 when she began posting videos of herself covering popular songs online. One of her videos caught the attention of producer [[Dr. Luke]], who subsequently offered her a joint record deal with [[Kemosabe Records]] and [[RCA Records]]. While working on her debut effort, Gomez collaborated with artists [[will.i.am]], [[Cody Simpson]] and [[Cher Lloyd]]. Her official debut single, "Becky from the Block" (2013), received a positive reception upon its release. She released her debut extended play, ''[[Play It Again (EP)|Play It Again]]'' (2013), later that same year. Her second single, "[[Can't Get Enough (Becky G song)|Can't Get Enough]]" (2014), featured guest vocals from [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]] and went on to top the [[Latin Rhythm Airplay]] chart in the United States.

Gomez achieved mainstream success with the release of "[[Shower (song)|Shower]]" (2014), which went on to enter the top twenty of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The single would go on to receive a multi platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), denoting two million units sold in the country. Following the success of "Shower", Gomez released "[[Can't Stop Dancin' (Becky G song)|Can't Stop Dancin']]" (2014), "Lovin' So Hard" and "[[Break a Sweat]]" (2015) as singles from her forthcoming album. She embarked on a co-headlining tour with [[J Balvin]] throughout September and October 2015, spanning throughout the United States. She portrayed Valentina Galindo in two episodes of the musical television series ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'', contributing two new songs to the soundtrack of the series called "Do It" and "New New". Gomez was featured on the song "Superstar" (2016) with [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. She released her first Spanish song "[[Sola (Becky G song)|Sola]]".

In July 2017, she released her single "[[Mayores]]", with rapper [[Bad Bunny]], which topped the charts in Spain, Ecuador, Chile and El Salvador, while reaching number three on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Latin Songs]] chart. Her success led her to collaborate with artists such as [[Daddy Yankee]], [[French Montana]] and [[David Guetta]], in addition to being the opening act for girl group [[Fifth Harmony]], for the Latin American leg of their PSA Tour, with shows in Argentina, Chile, and Mexico, that same year. In April 2018, she released another hit single "[[Sin Pijama]]" with Dominican singer [[Natti Natasha]], which also entered the top five of the Hot Latin Songs, peaked at number one in Spain and the top 10 in several countries. In July 2018, Gomez released "Zooted", featuring [[French Montana]] and [[Farruko]], as her first English-language song in three years. 
On September 27, 2019, she featured on the "[[Chicken Noodle Soup (J-Hope song)|Chicken Noodle Soup]]" remix by South Korean rapper and dancer [[J-Hope]] of [[BTS (band)|BTS]].

Gomez took to [[Snapchat]] to speak about the incident and also revealed that she has been dealing with anxiety, explaining why she ran during the commotion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.refinery29.com/2017/10/176068/becky-g-crying-in-fan-video-response|title=Becky G Was Brought To Tears After A Fan Got Too Rough|last=Reilly|first=Kaitlin|date=October 10, 2017|website=Refinery 29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012143624/http://www.refinery29.com/2017/10/176068/becky-g-crying-in-fan-video-response|archive-date=October 12, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/10/becky-g-cries-hurt-fan-mob-video/|title=Becky G Breaks Down Sobbing After She's 'Hurt' In Ugly Fan Encounter: 'I'm A Human Being'|last=Ginsberg|first=Gabriella|date=October 10, 2017|website=Hollywood Life|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171013032917/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/10/becky-g-cries-hurt-fan-mob-video/|archive-date=October 13, 2017|url-status=live|access-date=October 13, 2017}}</ref>
