Additionally, the comment “I’ll have what she’s having” said by a deli patron (played by Rob Reiner's real-life mother [[Estelle Reiner]]) watching the scene unfold nearby, was an idea from Billy Crystal.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=The Last Interview and Other Conversations|last=Ephron|first=Nora|publisher=Melville House Publishing|year=2015|isbn=978-1-61219-524-7|location=Brooklyn, New York}}</ref> Ephron's script was nominated for the 1990 Oscar in Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen.<ref name=":1" />
