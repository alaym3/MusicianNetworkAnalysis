=== Early career (1996) ===
After his football career, Johnson decided to pursue a career as a professional wrestler.<ref name="islandconnections" /> Veteran wrestler [[Pat Patterson (wrestler)|Pat Patterson]] got Johnson several tryout matches with the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 1996.

The Rock would then regularly insult the audience, WWF performers, and interviewers in his [[Promos (professional wrestling)|promos]].<ref name="nation" />

At [[D-Generation X: In Your House]], [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]] defeated the Rock in under six minutes to retain the Intercontinental Championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse19.html |title=In Your House 19: D-Generation X results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514225935/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse19.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The next night on ''Raw Is War'', Austin was ordered by [[Vince McMahon|Mr. McMahon]] to defend the title in a rematch, but forfeited it to the Rock instead, handing him the title belt before hitting him with the ''[[Stunner (professional wrestling)|Stone Cold Stunner]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997/raw120897 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026202130/http://www.otherarena.com/htm/cgi-bin/history.cgi?1997%2Fraw120897 |archive-date=October 26, 2006 |title=WWF RAW: December 8, 1997 |publisher=The Other Arena |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |title=The Rock's second Intercontinental Championship reign |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428234605/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/intercontinental/322552 |archive-date=April 28, 2007}}</ref> The Rock feuded with Austin and [[Ken Shamrock]] through the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/198811511/results/ |title=Royal Rumble 1998 official results |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |access-date=March 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm14/results/ |title=WrestleMania XIV official results |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313110737/http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/history/wm14/results/ |archive-date=March 13, 2008}}</ref> On January 19, 1998, at [[Royal Rumble (1998)|Royal Rumble]], the Rock defeated Shamrock by disqualification to retain the Intercontinental title.

On March 29, at [[WrestleMania XIV]], he defeated Shamrock by disqualification once again to retain the title. The next night, on ''Raw is War'', the Rock debuted a new Intercontinental Championship design and would later overthrow Faarooq as leader of the Nation of Domination to spark a feud between the two. He then successfully defended the Intercontinental title against Faarooq at [[Over the Edge: In Your House]] on May 31. The stable would then refer to themselves as simply "The Nation".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse22.html |title=In Your House 22: Over the Edge 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}</ref>

The Rock and The Nation then feuded with [[Triple H]] and [[D-Generation X]], with the two stable leaders first meeting in the quarter-final of the [[King of the Ring (1998)#King of the Ring bracket|1998]] [[King of the Ring tournament]], which the Rock won. At [[King of the Ring (1998)|King of the Ring]], the Rock defeated [[Dan Severn]] in the semi-final match and lost to rival Ken Shamrock in the final. The Rock then resumed his feud with Triple H, as the two had a [[two out of three falls match]] at [[Fully Loaded: In Your House]] for the Intercontinental title, which the Rock retained in controversial fashion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/inyourhouse23.html |title=In Your House 23: Fully Loaded 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008}}</ref> This led to a [[ladder match]] at [[SummerSlam (1998)|SummerSlam]], where the Rock lost the title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1998/results/ |title=SummerSlam 1998 official results |publisher=[[World Wrestling Entertainment]] |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620164459/http://www.wwe.com/shows/summerslam/history/1998/results/ |archive-date=June 20, 2007}}</ref>

The Rock saw a big uptick in fan support during this time, causing him to be booked in a feud with fellow Nation members [[Mark Henry]] and D'Lo Brown, turning [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] in the process. Henry defeated him at [[Judgment Day: In Your House]], after interference from Brown, effectively breaking up the stable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html |title=In Your House 24: Breakdown 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514225942/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/breakdown98.html |archive-date=May 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html |title=In Your House 25: Judgment Day 1998 results |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |access-date=March 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128011334/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/wweppv/judgementday98.html |archive-date=January 28, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Rock continued to feud with Mankind over the WWF Championship, which was traded back and forth between them. First, in the main event of the January 4, 1999 episode of ''Raw Is War'', Mankind defeated the Rock after interference from Stone Cold Steve Austin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |title=WWE RAW (1999) – January 4, 1999 – RAW |date=January 4, 1999 |access-date=March 13, 2009 |publisher=Online World of Wrestling |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607173232/http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/results/raw/_1999/ |archive-date=June 7, 2008}}</ref> Then at the [[Royal Rumble (1999)|Royal Rumble]] on January 24, the Rock regained the title in a brutal [["I quit" match|“I Quit” match]], a type of submission match that only ends if one of the combatants says “I quit” on a microphone. Intended to show a vicious mean streak in the Rock's character, this match went horribly wrong as at the end of the match the Rock hit Mankind in the head with a steel chair 11 times instead of the scripted five, five shots already being a risky amount (most wrestling matches in the Attitude Era involving steel chairs had at most 2 or 3 shots to the head). After the 5th shot, Mankind was still at ringside instead of being two-thirds up the entrance ramp where he was supposed to be, and after the eleventh shot which knocked a bloodied Mankind out, a recording of Mankind saying "I Quit" from an earlier interview was played over the public address system.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/royalrumble/history/19881143/results/ |title=Royal Rumble 1999 official results |publisher=WWE |access-date=March 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412 |title=The Rock's second WWE Championship reign |publisher=WWE |access-date=March 19, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080309231225/http://www.wwe.com/inside/titlehistory/wwechampionship/3044541412 |archive-date=March 9, 2008}}</ref> On January 31, during an episode of ''[[Sunday Night Heat]]'', the Rock and Mankind participated in an [[Professional wrestling match types#Empty Arena match|Empty Arena match]], a match that took place in an arena with 22,000 empty seats where any part of the facility could be used to contest the match.

As part of the WWF's battle against The Alliance, the Rock wrestled in a "winner takes all" five-on-five elimination tag team match at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] where the losing team's company would be dissolved in storyline. He was a member of Team WWF along with Chris Jericho, The Undertaker, Kane, and Big Show. The Alliance's team consisted of Stone Cold Steve Austin, Kurt Angle, Booker T, [[Rob Van Dam]], and Shane McMahon. In the end, it came down to a one-on-one between the Rock and Stone Cold Steve Austin. The Rock seemed to have the upper hand, until his teammate Jericho entered the ring and attacked the Rock. Austin tried to capitalize on this by pinning the Rock, but Kurt Angle revealed his true allegiance by attacking Austin. The Rock then pinned Austin, giving Team WWF the victory and forcing The Alliance to disband. The Rock's WCW Championship was renamed the unbranded "World Championship" following the Alliance's loss.<ref name="survivorseries01">{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/2001/mainevent/ |title=The Rock, Chris Jericho, Big Show, Kane & Undertaker def.
