'''Exo''' ({{lang-ko|엑소}}; stylized in [[all caps]]) is a South Korean-Chinese [[boy band]] based in [[Seoul]], consisting of nine members: [[Xiumin]], [[Suho]], [[Lay Zhang|Lay]], [[Baekhyun]], [[Chen (singer)|Chen]], [[Park Chanyeol|Chanyeol]], [[D.O. (entertainer)|D.O.]], [[Kai (entertainer, born 1994)|Kai]] and [[Oh Se-hun|Sehun]]. The band was formed by [[SM Entertainment]] in 2011 and debuted in 2012. Their music—released and performed in Korean, Mandarin, and Japanese—primarily incorporates [[Pop music|pop]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], including elements of [[electronic dance music]] genres such as [[House music|house]] and [[Trap music (EDM)|trap]]. The band ranked as one of the top five most influential celebrities on the [[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|''Forbes'' Korea Power Celebrity]] list from 2014 to 2018 and have been labeled "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Kings of K-pop]]" and the "Biggest boyband in the world" by various media outlets.

The band debuted with twelve members separated into two sub-groups: Exo-K (Suho, Baekhyun, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun) and Exo-M (Xiumin, Lay, Chen, and former members [[Kris Wu|Kris]], [[Lu Han|Luhan]], and [[Huang Zitao|Tao]]). Kris, Luhan, and Tao departed the group individually amid legal battles in 2014 and 2015. Exo-K and Exo-M performed music in Korean and Mandarin, respectively, until the release of their third [[Extended play|EP]] [[Overdose (EP)|Overdose]] in 2014. Since 2015, Exo have exclusively performed as one group while continuing to release and perform music in multiple languages. Members Chen, Baekhyun, and Xiumin debuted as the sub-unit [[Exo-CBX]] in 2016, and members Sehun and Chanyeol began promoting as the sub-unit [[Exo-SC]] in 2019. Each member also maintains solo careers in music, film and television.

Exo's first album ''[[XOXO (Exo album)|XOXO]]'' (2013), released alongside breakthrough single "[[Growl (song)|Growl]]",  was a critical and commercial success; it sold over one million copies, which made Exo the first Korean artist to do so in twelve years. Their later works also had strong sales, with their Korean studio albums each selling over one million copies. Exo's sixth album, ''[[Don't Mess Up My Tempo]]'' (2018), became their highest-charting album on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], debuting at number 23, and their best selling album in South Korea, where it sold over 1.9 million copies.

Exo have won numerous awards throughout their career, including five consecutive [[Mnet Asian Music Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] awards at the [[Mnet Asian Music Awards]] and two consecutive Artist of the Year awards at the [[Melon Music Awards]], and have performed over 100 concerts across four headlining tours and multiple joint tours. Outside of music, the band members have endorsement deals with brands such as [[Nature Republic]] and [[Samsung]] and participate in philanthropic efforts such as Smile For U, an ongoing project by SM Entertainment and [[UNICEF]] that began in 2015.

In a 2017 interview with ''Billboard'', Chanyeol spoke about his contributions to the lyrics for "Chill", stating that because he "worked on the lyrics with an empty track without demo lyrics", the process came more "naturally" to him.<ref name="Billboard The War Song Breakdown" /> Chen explained the process of writing their single "Ko Ko Bop": "[we] wrote the lyrics separately and worked on putting [them] together for the song afterwards.

On their stage design, ''Music Mind'' noted Exo's use of "not only ... the stage-lights and the lightsticks, but also [a] multitude of special effects like water, flames, and fireworks, not to mention huge screens positioned both on the substage and across the whole perimeter of the venue".<ref>
