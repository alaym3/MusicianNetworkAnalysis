'''Thug Life''' was an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group that consisted of [[Tupac Shakur|2Pac]], [[Big Syke]], [[Mopreme Shakur|Mopreme]],  Macadoshis, and The Rated R. They released one album, 1994's ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'', before disbanding in 1995.

==Etymology==
According to 2Pac, the name originally started as an acronym: "The Hate U Give Little Infants Fucks Everybody". It represented the idea that the racism and marginalization experienced by black youth ends up biting back on society.[https://www.epicreads.com/blog/tupac-thug-life-hate-u-give/]

==History==
Big Syke was a Crips gang member and Macadoshis was a drug dealer during the 90's. 2Pac, Randy "Stretch" Walker and Princess Mel formed Thug Life in 1992 with Tyruss "Little Psycho" Himes.<ref name=allmusicbio>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p211189|pure_url=yes}} Big Syke bio] at [[Allmusic]]</ref> They recorded a song also titled, "Thug Life".  Soon Little Psycho joined the group, under the name Syke. Later Macadoshis and The Rated R joined the group. They signed with Interscope Records and recorded an LP titled ''Thug Life Volume 1''. Tupac's stepbrother, Mopreme Shakur, later joined the group.

== ''Thug Life: Volume 1'' ==
On September 26, 1994, ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'' was released.

The first single and video was "Pour Out a Little Liquor" (which originally appeared on the ''[[Above the Rim (soundtrack)|Above the Rim]]'' soundtrack, released six months earlier), which was a Tupac solo song.
