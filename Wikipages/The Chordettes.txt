'''The Chordettes''' were an American female [[popular music|popular]] singing quartet, and specializing in [[traditional popular music]]. They are best known for their songs "[[Mr. Sandman]]" and "[[Lollipop (1958 song)|Lollipop]]".

==Career==
The group organized in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]], in 1946. The original members of the group were Janet Ertel (''née'' Buschmann; September 21, 1913 – November 22, 1988), Alice Mae ''Buschmann'' Spielvogel, Dorothy "Dottie" (Hummitzsch) Schwartz, and [[Jinny Osborn]]/Lockard (April 25, 1927 – May 19, 2003). Alice Spielvogel was replaced by Carol Buschmann, her sister-in-law, in 1947. In 1952, Lynn Evans (''née'' Hargate; May 2, 1924 – February 6, 2020)<ref name=obit/> replaced Schwartz, as Evans described in a 2015 interview.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL0Cy5KZqBA|title=MRS. SANDMAN: A Chat with The Chordettes' Lynn Evans|last=PogieJoe|date=January 14, 2015|website=YouTube|access-date=February 6, 2020|archive-date=October 16, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201016101922/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aL0Cy5KZqBA|url-status=live}}</ref> And in 1953, Margie Needham replaced Osborn (who was having a baby), though Osborn later returned to the group. [[Nancy Overton]] joined the group for live performances in 1957 after Janet Ertel, who was more than a decade older than the other members of the group, decided to retire from touring, although Ertel continued to perform on recorded material. Originally they sang [[folk music]] in the style of [[The Weavers]], but eventually changed to a harmonizing style of the type known as [[Barbershop music|barbershop harmony]] or [[close harmony]]. Part of this change seems to be influenced by Osborn's father.{{Citation needed|date = April 2014}}

Jinny Osborn was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. She was born ''Virginia Cole'', the daughter of O. H. "King" Cole, who was president (1948-1949)<ref>{{cite news

After performing locally in Sheboygan, they won on [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s radio program ''[[Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts|Talent Scouts]]'' in 1949. They held feature status on Godfrey's daily program, and in 1950 cut their first LP, a collection of standards titled ''Harmony Time.'' for Columbia Records. Three more LPs followed.<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/epm/4893?q=The+Chordettes&search=quick&pos=1&_start=1|title = Chordettes|date =2006-07-04|access-date = 2015-02-22|website = Oxford Music Online|publisher = Oxford Music Online}}</ref>

In 1953, Godfrey's music director and orchestra leader, [[Archie Bleyer]], founded [[Cadence Records]]. He signed a number of Godfrey regulars and former regulars, including the Chordettes, who had a number of hit records for Cadence.

Beginning in January 1954, the group sang on the ''[[Robert Q. Lewis#Television|Robert Q. Lewis Show]]'', a weekday afternoon program on CBS-TV.<ref>{{cite news |title=Monday (11) |url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-TV-Index/1954/TV-Index-1954-01-11.pdf |access-date=August 8, 2020 |work=Ross Reports on Television |date=January 11, 1954 |page=1 |archive-date=September 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200903184721/https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-TV-Index/1954/TV-Index-1954-01-11.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Chordettes had released a couple of singles with Arthur Godfrey on Columbia in 1950-51 but didn't cut a solo single until their breakout hit ''Mr. Sandman'', released in late 1954 and which went on to become a #1 1955 hit. Archie Bleyer himself is on that record along with the group; Bleyer stripped down the sound to highlight the girls' voices. They also hit #2 with 1958's "[[Lollipop (1958 song)|Lollipop]]" and also charted with a vocal version of the themes from Disney's ''[[Zorro (1957 TV series)|Zorro]]'' (U.S. #17) (1959) and the film ''[[Never on Sunday]]'' (U.S. #13) (1961). Other hits for the group included "Eddie My Love" (U.S. #14) (a cover of a song by doo-wop group The Teen Queens), "Born to Be With You" (U.S. #5), "Lay Down Your Arms" in 1956, and "Just Between You and Me" (U.S. #8) in 1957. Their cover of "The White Rose Of Athens" hit the Australian Top 15 in May, 1962. The US single "In The Deep Blue Sea" was a one-week Music Vendor entry four months later (#128).

Janet Ertel married Bleyer in 1954. Her daughter Jackie married another Cadence recording star, Phil Everly of [[The Everly Brothers]].

The Chordettes appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' on August 5, 1957, the first episode of that show to be broadcast nationally on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Television Network]]. The Chordettes also appeared on ''[[American Bandstand]]'' on February 22, 1958, and again on April 26, 1958.

In 1961, Jinny Osborn again left the group. Unable to find a satisfactory replacement, the group disbanded in 1963.

==Recent events==
The group was inducted into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001.

The longest living member of the Chordettes who has sung on all the group's recordings, on both Columbia and Cadence recordings, is Carol Buschmann. Lynn Evans Mand sang on all the Chordettes' [[Cadence Records|Cadence]] Recordings. In 2004, Mand appeared on a [[PBS]] television special ''Magic Moments: The Best of 50s Pop'', with other 1950s pop icons, singing "Lollipop". Margie Needham Latzko and Carol Buschmann are the only surviving singers who recorded both "Mr. Sandman" and “Lollipop”.
