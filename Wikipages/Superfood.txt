{{Short description|Marketing term for food with supposed health benefits}}
'''Superfood''' is a [[marketing]] term for food claimed to confer [[health claim|health benefits]] resulting from an exceptional [[nutrient density]].<ref name=ufic/><ref name=fitz>{{cite book |author=Fitzgerald M |title=Diet Cults: The Surprising Fallacy at the Core of Nutrition Fads and a Guide to Healthy Eating for the Rest of US |chapter=It's a Bird! It's a Plane! It's Superfood! |year=2014 |publisher=Pegasus Books |isbn=978-1-60598-560-2 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dietcultssurpris0000fitz }}</ref> The term is not commonly used by experts, [[dietitian]]s and [[Nutritionist|nutrition scientists]], most of whom dispute that particular foods have the health benefits claimed by their advocates. Even without scientific evidence of exceptional nutrient content, many new, exotic, and foreign fruits or [[ancient grain]]s are marketed under the term &ndash; or ''superfruit'' or ''supergrain'' respectively &ndash; after being introduced or re-introduced to Western markets.

In 2007, the marketing of products as "superfoods" was prohibited in the [[European Union]] unless accompanied by a specific authorized [[health claim]] supported by credible [[scientific research]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Superfood 'ban' comes into effect |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/6252390.stm |website=BBC News |access-date=12 July 2019}}</ref>

==Definition and use of the term==
The term has no official definition by regulatory authorities in major consumer markets, such as the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] and [[United States Department of Agriculture|Department of Agriculture]] or the [[European Food Safety Authority]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Amy|title=Understanding Food: Principles and Preparation|url=https://archive.org/details/understandingfoo00brow_091|url-access=limited|year=2010|isbn=978-0-538-73498-1|page=[https://archive.org/details/understandingfoo00brow_091/page/n366 331]}}</ref> It appears to have been first used in a Canadian newspaper in 1949 when referring to the supposed nutritional qualities of a [[muffin]].<ref name=fitz/>{{rp|68}} In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the term "superfood" was used as a [[marketing tool]] for selling specific foods, [[dietary supplements]], foods with selected [[food additive]]s, and [[self-help book]]s about [[fad diet]]s, promising an enhancement to health. "Superfood" products were sold at a higher price than similar foods not marketed with the label.<ref name=fitz/>{{rp|71}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.healthline.com/health-news/how-superfoods-like-bulletproof-coffee-get-popular-012715|title=How 'Superfoods' Like Bulletproof Coffee Get Popular (Hint: It's Not Nutritional Science)|date=January 2015|publisher=Healthline|access-date=10 Mar 2015}}</ref> The purported health benefits and effects of foods described as ''superfoods'' are unsupported or disputed by [[scientific studies]].<ref name="ufic" />

==History and economics==

In 2007, the ''superfoods'' category was forecast to become a billion-dollar global industry by 2011,<ref name="mcnally20070810">{{Cite news|first=Alex |last=McNally |date=10 August 2007 |title=Superfoods market set to double by 2011 |url=http://www.nutraingredients.com/Consumer-Trends/Superfoods-market-set-to-double-by-2011 |publisher=William Reed Business Media Ltd. |access-date=22 June 2009}}</ref> with several thousand new superfruit products expected to enter the marketplace. According to [[Datamonitor]], superfruit product launches grew at a rate of 67% (2007–2008), but underwent significant category erosion beginning in 2011, when introductions of food and nonfood products featuring [[pomegranate]], [[açaí]] or [[goji]] declined by 56% (2011–2012 vs. 2009–2010).<ref name="mcnally20070810" />

More than a dozen industry publications on [[functional food|functional foods and beverage]]s have referred to various exotic species as ''superfruits'', with estimates for some 10,000 new product introductions in 2007–2008.<ref name=sohn/><ref name=mcnally20070810/>  Relatively rare fruits originating from [[Oceania]] ([[noni]]), [[China]] ([[goji]], [[seabuckthorn]]), [[Southeast Asia]] ([[mangosteen]]), or tropical [[South America]] ([[açaí]]) and unknown to American consumers were among the first wave of superfruits successfully used in product manufacturing from 2005 to 2010.<ref name=schardt2006/>
