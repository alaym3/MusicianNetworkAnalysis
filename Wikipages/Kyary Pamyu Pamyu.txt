During an interview with ''[[The Fader]]'', Kyary was asked if she meant to make music outside of Asia, where she responded; "At first, I didn't think about global markets at all. But even in Japanese, my lyrics don't make any sense and have a kind of mystery, like on "[[PONPONPON|Pon Pon Pon]]" and "[[Tsukematsukeru]]". I can feel that what I'm doing in Japanese is catchy to global audiences anyway."<ref name="Interview" /> [[Keiichi Ishizaka]], chairman and CEO of Warner Music Japan Inc, commented on her image to ''[[The Japan Times]]'', saying "[Kyary] is a person who came directly out of Tokyo's Harajuku culture, and there is a growing international interest in Japan's ''kawaii'' culture."<ref name="japantimes" /> Many critics and publications noted the increase in popularity of Japanese pop culture outside Japan, such as its fashion and animation, and Kyary's role as its global ambassador. Ishizaka believed that with the advent of the Internet, there is no difference in time and distance among countries anymore."<ref name="japantimes">{{cite web|url=http://the-japan-news.com/news/article/0000708084 |title=The Japan News |publisher=The Japan News |access-date=July 20, 2014}}</ref> [[Seibu Railway]] honored her by running a train on the [[Seibu Ikebukuro Line]], part of their [[Seibu 9000 series]], from June to September 2016, themed on the pop star's music videos, which also passed through her birthplace [[Nishitōkyō, Tokyo]].<ref>[https://www.nippon.com/en/views/b05104/ All Aboard the Kyary Pamyu Pamyu Train!]</ref>

===In the media===
Many of Kyary's singles, including "[[Candy Candy (song)|Candy Candy]]", "[[Invader Invader]]", and "[[Fashion Monster]]" have generated millions of views on [[YouTube]]. Her single "[[Furisodation]]" generated minor controversy in Japan, where a citizens' group believed the video encouraged alcohol and smoking, a claim which her label denied.<ref>[http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/0130/TKY201301300533.html 朝日新聞デジタル：きゃりーぱみゅぱみゅさん、新曲ＰＶで一気飲み？ – カルチャー<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002192536/http://www.asahi.com/culture/update/0130/TKY201301300533.html |date=October 2, 2013 }}</ref>
