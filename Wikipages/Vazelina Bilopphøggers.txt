'''Vazelina Bilopphøggers''' is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] band founded in 1979, in [[Gjøvik]], [[Norway]].<ref>[http://www.snl.no/Vazelina_Bilopph%C3%B8ggers Vazelina Bilopphøggers] in [[Store norske leksikon]] {{in lang|no}}</ref> They are known for their comedic re-interpretations of old [[rockabilly]] songs, where they re-write the lyrics in their own dialect. They have had several hits in Norway and have worked with many Norwegian stage artists and comedians. They have also been interpreted through comic books and computer games. In 1991 they provided the music for the Norwegian version of ''[[Rock-A-Doodle]]'', and also provided the voices of some of the characters in the Norwegian dub; Viggo Sandvik voiced Chanticleer, Elder Vågan voiced Patou, Jan Einar Johnsen voiced Snipes and Arnulf Paulsen voiced Stuey. In December 2000 they starred in a Christmas revue on [[TV 2 (Norway)|TV 2]].

They are one of the active groups in Norway that have been playing the longest. The name, as the myth goes, was improvised on the phone, when they needed a band name in their first competition, where they won. ''Bilopphøggers'' is the Norwegian name for [[Wrecking yard|auto wreckers]], and drummer [[Arnulf Paulsen]] ran a [[wrecking yard]] on the side.
