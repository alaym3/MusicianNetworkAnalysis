{{Nihongo|'''Kamaitachi'''|かまいたち}} was a Japanese [[visual kei]] [[punk rock]] band, formed in [[Kyoto]] and active from 1985 to 1991. Their album ''Hachamecha Kyou'' reached number 10 on the [[Oricon]] chart and was named one of the top albums from 1989 to 1998 in a 2004 issue of the music magazine ''Band Yarouze''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 44 Albums from 1989 - 1998|url=http://www.jame-world.com/us/articles-5-top-44-albums-from-1989-1998.html|work=jame-world.com|date=2004-05-09|accessdate=2013-03-08}}</ref> They have performed several times since reuniting for a one-off performance in 2015.

==History==
''Kamaitachi'' was formed in October 1985 by drummer Ken-chan and bassist Mogwai.<ref name="JaME Profile">{{cite web | title = JaME Profile| work = jame-world.com| url = http://www.jame-world.com/us/artists-biography-272-kamaitachi.html| date = 2011-03-06}}</ref> After several member changes, vocalist Sceana and guitarist Kazzy joined completing the final lineup. They signed with [[Free-Will]] in 1989 and released their debut album, ''Itachigokko'', in September. The album sold out by pre-orders alone, so a second press was released the following year under the title, ''Super Itachigokko''.<ref name="JaME Profile"/> That year the band signed to [[Toy's Factory]] and in September released their major debut, ''Hachamecha Kyou''.<ref name="JaME Profile"/> They released their third album, ''Jekyll to Hyde -Masturbation-'', on June 1, 1991. However, at a June 26 concert they announced they would disband after their last concert on September 6, 1991, for unknown reasons. Later that month a single and a compilation album, both titled "I Love You", were released to fulfill their contract.<ref name="JaME Profile"/>

After disbanding, Ken-chan started using the stagename "Kenzi" and started the band [[The Dead Pop Stars]] and the long-running [[hardcore punk]] act [[Anti Feminism]]. Sceana and Kazzy formed the [[industrial rock]] duo [[Genkaku Allergy]], while Mogwai performs in the punk band Flesh for Flankenstein.

To celebrate the 30th anniversary of his musical activities, Kenzi held a special concert on October 12, 2015 at Shinjuku Blaze. Kenzi, Sceana, and Mogwai performed four songs as Kamaitachi with guest guitarist Sheja.<ref>{{cite web|title=かまいたち、一夜限りの復活|url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000119501|language=Japanese|work=barks.jp|date=2015-09-07|accessdate=2015-09-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=【ライブレポート】かまいたち、伝説第二弾を発表|url=http://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000120705|language=Japanese|work=barks.jp|date=2015-10-13|accessdate=2015-10-16}}</ref> They reunited again to perform on the first day of the Visual Japan Summit on October 14, 2016 at [[Makuhari Messe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=＜VISUAL JAPAN SUMMIT 2016＞第5弾に、BY-SEXUALとかまいたち|url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000130360|language=Japanese|work=barks.jp|date=2016-09-01|accessdate=2016-09-09}}</ref> They then performed two more shows, a one-man live at Shinjuku Loft on January 14, 2017 and a show at Kyoto Muse on April 1, before playing a final concert at [[Akasaka Blitz]] on August 5.<ref>{{cite web|title=【レポート】かまいたち、26年ぶりワンマンに"猫ひろし"乱入「あと2本、ほんまにそれで終わり」|url=https://www.barks.jp/news/?id=1000137192|language=Japanese|work=barks.jp|date=2017-01-18|accessdate=2017-04-02}}</ref>
