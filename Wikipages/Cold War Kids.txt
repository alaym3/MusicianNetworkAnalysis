Forming in 2004 in [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] California, the Cold War Kids' early releases came from [[independent record label]] Monarchy Music. In 2006, the band signed with [[Downtown Records|Downtown]]/[[V2 Records|V2]] and released their major label debut ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' to cult appeal from fans and critics. 2008's ''[[Loyalty to Loyalty]]'' and 2011's ''[[Mine Is Yours]]'' saw the band develop different musical sounds and lyrical content throughout to mixed reviews. The band's seventh studio album, ''New Age Norms 1'', was released on November 1, 2019.

===2004–2006: Early years and ''Robbers & Cowards''===
[[File:ColdWarKids NY07 rotated cropped.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Cold War Kids performing at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City, 2007]]
The members of Cold War Kids met at [[Biola University]].<ref name="Stereogum">{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/4368/christianity_and_the_cold_war_kids_backlash/news/|title=Christianity And The Cold War Kids Backlash|author=Stereogum Staff|work=[[Stereogum]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=January 18, 2007|access-date=December 6, 2014}}</ref> They formed a band in 2004 when they would meet regularly in Jonnie Russell's apartment above a restaurant called Mulberry Street in downtown [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]]. Maust came up with the band's name around 1997, during his travels in Eastern Europe with his brother, where they found a park in [[Budapest]] with missing statues, taken away after Communism fell. Seeing that there was a playground in the park, Maust said "...being in that environment just made the phrase 'Cold War Kids' pop into my head. I may have heard it before. I'm a Cold War kid, too – I was born in 1979."<ref name="SPIN">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2011/03/why-theyre-called-cold-war-kids/|title=Why They're Called...

The band relocated to [[Whittier, California]], and began recording their first demo, which Monarchy Music released as the EP ''[[Mulberry Street (EP)|Mulberry Street]]'' (based on the restaurant where they regularly met) in spring 2005. Between tours, the band released two more EPs: ''[[With Our Wallets Full]]'' and ''[[Up in Rags]]'', in 2006. Monarchy Music would re-release those EPs as one compilation album titled ''[[Up in Rags/With Our Wallets Full]]'' in 2006.

In summer 2006, Cold War Kids signed with [[Downtown Records]] and started work on their debut album. The album titled ''[[Robbers & Cowards]]'' was released on October 10, 2006, with sales close to 200,000 copies.<ref name="Daily Beast">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/04/17/cold-war-kids-on-faith-hipster-detractors-their-musical-evolution.html|title=Cold War Kids on Faith, Hipster Detractors & Their Musical Revolution|last=Stern|first=Marlow|publisher=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=April 17, 2013|access-date=April 30, 2014}}</ref> Critics were impressed with the band's blues rock sound and lyrics that told morose tales of yesteryear: Joe Tacopino of ''[[PopMatters]]'' said that "These ambitious youngsters are definitely worth the trip, even without the ostentatious vocal harmonies."<ref name="PM">{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/6667/cold-war-kids-robber-cowards/|title=Cold War Kids: Robbers & Cowards Review|last=Tacopino|first=Joe|website=[[PopMatters]]|date=October 30, 2006|access-date=April 30, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061130082442/http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/6667/cold-war-kids-robber-cowards/|archive-date=November 30, 2006}}</ref> Jeff Weiss of [[Stylus Magazine]] called the album "[It’s] a good debut, maybe even a very good one.

===2008: ''Loyalty to Loyalty''===
After two years of non-stop worldwide touring and an eventual relocation to [[Long Beach, California]], Cold War Kids went back into the studio in spring 2008 with the producer of their first record, Kevin Augunas. Nathan described the record making process: “Throughout the record making process, we would write songs in our own little practice studio, then we’d go into the studio for, like, two days and record three or four songs, then go back into our own practice studio for, like, a few weeks. So really it was over the span of four months or something. Actual studio days probably like 15 days. We don’t love being in a studio; we focus more on the writing.”<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/cold-war-kids-nathan-willett-dishes-on-new-album/4161 |title=Cold War Kids’ Nathan Willett on ‘Loyalty to Loyalty’ – BlackBook |last=Carroll |first=Cory |publisher=[[Black Book Magazine]] |date=September 16, 2008 |access-date=April 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930224544/http://www.blackbookmag.com/article/cold-war-kids-nathan-willett-dishes-on-new-album/4161|archive-date=September 30, 2008}}</ref>

Cold War Kids' second album, ''[[Loyalty to Loyalty]]'', represented a departure from its debut, featuring a lot of narrative storytelling, as well as political and philosophical references. In an interview with [[NPR]], Nathan described the songwriting process for the album: "The choices that we make have always been organic ones, to try to grow at a rate that makes sense," Willett says. "Not necessarily talking about, 'Is there a great single? Is this a big breakthrough for us? Is this the next level for us?' But just write songs. Yeah, there is a stress, and the way we deal with it is to ignore it."<ref name="NPR">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94925127|title=Cold War Kids: Pondering Personal Politics|last=Bordal|first=Christian|publisher=[[NPR]]|date=September 23, 2008|access-date=July 30, 2014}}</ref> ''Loyalty to Loyalty'' was released on September 23, 2008, to generally positive reviews from critics.<ref name="Loyalty To Loyalty">{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/loyalty-to-loyalty/cold-war-kids|title=Loyalty To Loyalty Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> Bart Blasengame of ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' called it "a better-than-solid album from a band that seemed equipped to someday make a classic one."<ref name="Paste">{{cite web |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2008/09/cold-war-kids-loyalty-to-loyalty.html |title=Cold War Kids: Loyalty to Loyalty – Review |last=Blasengame |first=Bart |publisher=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] |date=September 22, 2008 |access-date=May 12, 2014}}</ref> James McMahon of ''[[NME]]'' said that "Almost in defiance of poor sales and cult following, CWK and their charming second album embody everything you hoped music might be."<ref name="NME">{{cite web |url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/cold-war-kids/9913 |title=Album Review: Cold War Kids – Loyalty to Loyalty (V2) |last=McMahon |first=James |work=[[NME]] |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |date=September 17, 2008 |access-date=July 10, 2011}}</ref>

===2009–2011: ''Behave Yourself'' and ''Mine is Yours''===
Cold War Kids spent the end of 2008 and most of 2009 on the road touring for ''Loyalty to Loyalty'', highlighted by a national tour with [[Death Cab for Cutie]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34476-death-cab-for-cutie-announce-spring-us-tour/|title=Death Cab for Cutie Announce Spring U.S. tour|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|website=Pitchfork|date=January 27, 2009|access-date=April 29, 2014}}</ref> In between touring, the band returned to the studio to record what would become their seventh EP, ''[[Behave Yourself (EP)|Behave Yourself]]''. In an interview with ''Flavorwire'', Maust talked about the differences between this and ''Loyalty to Loyalty'': "It’s basically the happier, more vibrant songs that didn’t really fit on the [Loyalty] album. We realized that in a way, we were starting to work ahead of ourselves, so this [EP] works as a nice bridge between records."<ref name="Flavorwire">{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/62214/the-art-of-cold-war-kids-bassist-matt-maust/|title=The Art of Cold War Kids Bassist Matt Maust|last=Dambrot|first=Shana Nys|work=Flavorwire|publisher=Flavorpill Media|date=January 18, 2010|access-date=April 30, 2014}}</ref> ''Behave Yourself'' was released digitally on [[iTunes]] on December 21, 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/behave-yourself-ep/id346032926 |title=iTunes – Music – Behave Yourself – EP by Cold War Kids |publisher=[[iTunes]] (US).

Cold War Kids went back into the studio in February 2010. Willett, when speaking to ''[[Filter Magazine]]'', said, "Album three is in the works now. We are working with a producer named [[Jacquire King]]. He has a sweet and eclectic roster of [[Modest Mouse]], the [[The Fall (Norah Jones album)|last Norah Jones record]], [[Tom Waits]]' [[Mule Variations]], [[Come Around Sundown|the last Kings of Leon record]]...So, he is going to work miracles with us. All of our music has always been written entirely by us, without any influence, so to have him step in and help us with the direction is tremendous. I was just watching [[I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco|the Wilco Documentary]] again, and I think that in many ways Wilco is to country/[[Americana (music)|Americana]] as Cold War Kids is to soul/[[Punk rock|punk]]. We are taking what we do to the next level on this record. The EP is the final reminder of the good old days of quick and fun, minimal Cold War Kids recording."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://filtermagazine.com/index.php/news/entry/cold_war_kids_q_a_part_1 |title=News – Q & A: Cold War Kids (Part 1) |last=Lieu |first=Lynn |publisher=[[Filter (magazine)|Filter]] |date=January 4, 2010 |access-date=April 4, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100130082451/http://filtermagazine.com/index.php/news/entry/cold_war_kids_q_a_part_1 |archive-date=January 30, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
