Following the success of "Oh Dreamer," Gungor and Arndt set out to write a new suite and called it "World Keeps Spinning," which they released at the beginning of 2020, and which features the Biola University orchestra and chorale (cite this link here - https://www.biola.edu/blogs/biola-news/2020/biola-university-orchestra-and-chorale-featured-br)
