They were described as 'state of the art' at the time of the series' original airing in 1996. Independent producers Baxter Hobbins Slides developed a 3D [[Motion capture|motion-capture]] system, which was used to animate the characters. This consisted of [[Motion detector|motion sensor]] equipped suits, allowing the movements of actors to be mapped to the [[3D modeling|3D models]]. A real-time [[Wire-frame model|wireframe]] animated model of the characters could then be produced, after which skin and clothes were added. The lip movements of the characters were achieved by utilising the real lip movements of actors filmed against a [[Chroma key|blue screen]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/1996/02/01/16903-19960201/|title=BBC Schools bring cinema to class|access-date=2017-01-15}}</ref>
