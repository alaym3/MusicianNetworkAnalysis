'''Yeasayer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|eɪ|s|eɪ|.|ər}}) was an American [[experimental rock]] band from [[Brooklyn]], New York, formed in 2006. The band consisted of Chris Keating, Ira Wolf Tuton, and Anand Wilder. They announced their split on December 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/yeasayer-call-it-quits/|title=Yeasayer Call It Quits|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|last=Strauss|first=Matthew|date=December 19, 2019|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
The band's three core members, Chris Keating (born {{birth based on age as of date |28 |2010|1|31 |noage=1}}), Ira Wolf Tuton (born {{birth based on age as of date |30 |2010|1|31 |noage=1}}), and Anand Wilder (born {{birth based on age as of date |27 |2010|1|31 |noage=1}}), first came to attention after appearing at the [[SXSW]] festival in early 2007.<ref name=nyt>{{cite news |last=Pareles |first=Jon |date=28 January 2010 |title=Are Those Love Songs?

Chris Keating attended [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD), graduating from the Film, Animation, Video department in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|title=RISD XYZ Fall 2012|url=https://issuu.com/risd/docs/risdxyz_fall_2012/84|access-date=2021-02-28|website=Issuu|page=84|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Yeasayer's Scintillating Stage Show|url=https://our.risd.edu/post/30932901861/yeasayers-scintillating-stage-show|access-date=2021-02-28|website=Our RISD|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-11-07|title=Quit Your Day Job: Yeasayer|url=https://www.stereogum.com/7107/quit_your_day_job_yeasayer/interviews/quit-your-day-job/|access-date=2021-02-28|website=Stereogum|language=en}}</ref> While attending RISD, Keating started experimenting in playing a new type of musical sound.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Feature: Yeasayer|url=http://www.agitreader.com/features/yeasayer-02.08.html|access-date=2021-02-28|website=The Agit Reader}}</ref> He reached out to Anand Wilder and they started playing music together again, eventually forming the band.<ref name=":0" />

=== ''All Hour Cymbals'' ===
The band's lineup is relatively unique, with Keating and Wilder both serving as lead vocalists and principal songwriters and the band producing the songs together as a unit. Wilder, who began playing cello when he was four,<ref>{{cite web|last=Patel|first=Priya|title=BG Spotlight: Anand Wilder Of Yeasayer|url=http://browngirlmagazine.com/2010/05/bg-spotlight-anand-wilder-of-yeasayer/|publisher=Brown Girl Magazine|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref> described their songwriting styles to [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]: "When I write a song, I'm always thinking of the harmonies; for me the song doesn't really exist without the harmonies. For example, Forgiveness would be a really boring melody without the choir behind it. Chris resisted any formal musical training, but his sense of melody and songcraft is just astounding."<ref name="p4kAHC">{{cite web|last=Mackey|first=Robbie|title=Interviews: Yeasayer|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6759-yeasayer/|publisher=Pitchfork Media|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref>

Their first single consisted of a [[double A-side]] of the tracks "Sunrise" and "2080." Both songs appeared on their debut album ''[[All Hour Cymbals]]'', which was released in October 2007 via [[We Are Free]]. The band has self described their sound as "Middle Eastern-psych-snap-gospel."<ref name="washington-post">{{cite news | last = Malitz | first = David | title = Week Late Review: Yeasayer | work = Washington Post | date = January 23, 2008 | url = http://blog.washingtonpost.com/postrock/2008/01/week_late_review_yeasayer_1.html | format = Web | access-date = October 28, 2008}}</ref> Wilder has referenced influences including "[[Bollywood]] soundtracks from the 70s, [[Mapfumo]] records, and [[Celtic music]]."<ref name=p4kAHC/> Many critics described the album as having "spiritual" influences. Wilder expanded on this in an interview, stating: "When you lack any specific religion, you become open to all sorts of religious music. And I think everyone can agree that some of the most beautiful music ever written was done so in the name of God or gods."<ref name=p4kAHC/>

While supporting their debut album, the band became well known for their live performances, which often include psychedelic visuals. In 2008, Yeasayer toured with [[MGMT]] and [[Man Man]] and supported [[Beck]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/47595-yeasayer-announce-big-2008-tour|title=Yeasayer Announce Big 2008 Tour|last=Maher|first=Dave|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|date=December 12, 2007|access-date=2008-01-08}}</ref> The same year they performed a public [[a cappella]] concert, "Take Away Show", on the [[Paris metro]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.blogotheque.net/Yeasayer,3966|title=Yeasayer – Yeasayer |website=Blogtheque.net}}</ref> The band also played at [[Lollapalooza]], the [[Pitchfork Music Festival]], the [[Austin City Limits Festival]], [[Bonnaroo]], [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]], and the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. In 2009, Yeasayer contributed "Tightrope" to the AIDS benefit album [[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]] produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

===''Odd Blood''===
Backed by labels [[Secretly Canadian]] and [[Mute Records]], Yeasayer released their second studio album, ''[[Odd Blood]]'', in February 2010, featuring more pop music influences than earlier work. The band addressed the changes sonically in an in depth interview with [[The Quietus]], with Wolf Tuton stating: "I think the similar influences are there, but we have not focused on the same tones. We also wanted to focus on 90s dance music and production-wise get the low end thumping a little bit better. We also wanted to be more concise with our song writing and arrangement."<ref name=quietus>{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Thom|title=Rhesus AB Positive: A Yeasayer Interview About Odd Blood|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03589-rhesus-ab-positive-yeasayer-interview-about-odd-blood|publisher=The Quietus|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref> Keating continued, "The first album was such a wall of noise and we couldn’t do anymore with it so we tried to strip it away ... Creatively it was a departure and it was a challenge to try and do it and simplify ... it was ... fun to try and not hide behind the haze."<ref name=quietus/>

In February 2010, Yeasayer first appeared on the cover of The FADER in its 66th issue.<ref>{{cite news

The album was well received critically and commercially, with high placements on several notable year end best album lists including ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', and ''[[Under the Radar (magazine)|Under the Radar]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Suddath|first=Claire|title=The Top 10 Everything of 2010: Top 10 Albums|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2034644_2034619,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212232957/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2035319_2034644_2034619,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=December 12, 2010|publisher=Time|access-date=18 July 2013|date=December 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The 40 Best Albums of 2010|url=http://www.spin.com/gallery/40-best-albums-2010/?slide=30|publisher=Spin|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Under the Radar's Top 50 Albums of 2010|url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/lists/top_50_albums_of_2010|publisher=Under the Radar|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref>  In January 2011, [[The Hype Machine]] named Yeasayer the most blogged artist of 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://hypem.com/#!/zeitgeist/2010/artists/1 | title = Music Blog Zeitgeist, 50 Artists of 2010 | date = January 7, 2011 | access-date = 2011-01-07 | publisher = hypem.com}}</ref> Songs from ''Odd Blood'' were featured on several TV shows and films, including ''[[90210 (TV series)|90210]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', ''[[The Good Wife (TV series)|The Good Wife]]'', and the 2012 film [[Pitch Perfect]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwtv.com/music/90210/season-3/episode-315|title=The CW|work=The CW Network}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Jagernauth|first=Kevin|title=All The Songs In 'Pitch Perfect' Including La Roux, David Guetta, Azealia Banks, Nicki Minaj & More|url=http://blogs.indiewire.com/theplaylist/all-the-songs-in-pitch-perfect-including-la-roux-david-guetta-azealia-banks-nicki-minaj-more-20120925|publisher=Indie Wire|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref>

The band toured extensively behind ''Odd Blood,'' with appearances at several major festivals, including [[Coachella Music Festival]], the Dutch [[Pinkpop]] and [[Lowlands festival]], [[Latitude Festival]] in England, and the Australian music festival Splendour in the Grass, where they were asked by the organizers of Laneway Festival to return and play in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Did Laneway Steal Yeasayer From BDO?|url=http://www.radarradio.com.au/artists/interview/did-laneway-steal-yeasayer-from-big-day-out.aspx|publisher=Radar Music}}</ref>

In April 2011, Yeasayer released ''[[End Blood]]'' in participation with Record Store Day which the band described as "two ideas that didn't fit on ''[[Odd Blood]]''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://recordstoreday.com/SpecialRelease/4991|title = Record Store Day 2011 | date = April 17, 2011 | access-date = 2011-04-17}}</ref>

===''Fragrant World''===
In May 2011, the band premiered their brand new song "Devil and the Deed" on [[Conan O'Brien]]'s late night talk show. During their subsequent tour of North America, the band played this song at shows along with two other new tunes, "Demon Road" and "Henrietta". All three of these songs appeared on the final track listing for the band's next album.

On August 21, 2012, Yeasayer released ''[[Fragrant World]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fragrant World Reviews|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/fragrant-world/yeasayer|publisher=Metacritic}}</ref>  The band leaked the album version of "Henrietta" directly to 200 random fans by mailing them physical CDs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Richtie|first=John|title=Listen: Yeasayer - 'Henrietta'|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/listen-yeasayer-henrietta/|publisher=Music Feeds}}</ref> On where the inspiration for leaking the single directly to fans rather than via traditional channels came from, Keating stated: "I think #1, it's hard to do something secretive in the oversharing, Instagramming culture that we live in, so I liked the idea of a musical object you send to people ... I was actually interested to see if no one would share it at all. I thought that would be really cool. But I guess that doesn't happen anymore. Like 10 seconds after the first dude got the first envelope, I think he was in Belgium or the Netherlands or something, that guy was sharing it, and there it goes."<ref name=byt>{{cite web|last=Bonaime|first=Ross|title=Interview: Yeasayer|url=http://brightestyoungthings.com/articles/interview-yeasayer.htm|publisher=Brightest Young Things|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref> The rest of the album was leaked via an online scavenger hunt where the band gave fans clues as to where each song and an accompanying visual directed by Yoshi Sodeoka could be found.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kavner|first=Lucas|title=Yeasayer Leaks 'Fragrant World' As An Online Scavenger Hunt.

In much the same way that ''Odd Blood'' was a departure from ''All Hour Cymbals'', ''Fragrant World'' saw the band continuing to expand their sound. According to Wolf Tuton, while ''Odd Blood'' featured pop influences, ''Fragrant World'' deliberately shied away from them: "If the tone of something veered too closely to a random pop song or to something on our previous records, we’d immediately steer it in a different direction. It’s easy to swerve back into your comfort zone without even realizing it, so we were very conscious of trying to stay away from that and take this into some different sonic direction."<ref name=Stereogum>{{cite web|last=Rachel|first=T.

We allowed ourselves to experiment more, not really worrying about making the most catchy, anthemic pop songs for the Lollapalooza crowd ... We definitely wanted it to be a little bit darker than the last record."<ref>{{cite web|last=Conover|first=Matt|title=Interview: Yeasayer's Anand Wilder|url=http://prettymuchamazing.com/interview/yeasayer-anaand-wilder|publisher=Pretty Much Amazing|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref>

Although the band began the touring before the album's formal release, the set list for shows during this cycle consisted of many tracks from ''Fragrant World.'' The band worked to rearrange older songs so that they would fit better in the set, with Keating saying the main thing the band asked themselves in rehearsals was "What could we do to make an obvious change but still preserve the integrity of the song, and to give the song new life not just for us but also for the audience?"<ref name=byt/> The band partnered with [[C.E.B. Reas|Casey Reas]] and The Creators Project to develop an interactive set for the Fragrant World tour.<ref name=creators>{{cite web|last=Saeed|first=Abdullah|title=Yeasayer And Casey Reas Bring The Band's New Immersive Performance Environment To Central Park|url=http://thecreatorsproject.vice.com/blog/yeasayer-and-casey-reas-bring-the-bands-new-immersive-performance-environment-to-central-park|publisher=The Creators Project|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref> The set consisted of mirrored prism-like structures that "utilize[d] elements of reflection and refraction to produce an immersive, multi-layered experience that ... subsume[d] audiences in color and light."<ref name=creators/>

On June 21, 2013, the band posted a message on their [[Facebook]] page that they were going to be working on their fourth album after the end of the summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Summer Everyone.|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151490638186732&set=a.431357296731.217820.21417821731&type=1|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref> Wilder later confirmed this in a July 2013 interview, stating that the band had already started writing and plans to enter the studio this winter.<ref name=Juice>{{cite web|last=Lalwer|first=Joe|title=80/35 act Yeasayer's creative live adaptations|url=http://dmjuice.com/yeasayers-creative-live-adaptations/|publisher=Juice Magazine|access-date=18 July 2013}}</ref>

On November 12, 2013, the band released ''Good Evening, Washington D.C.'', a collection of live tracks recorded at the [[9:30 Club]].<ref name="Live Album Announcement">{{cite web |url=http://secretlycanadian.com/blog/2013/10/album-announce-yeasayer-good-evening-washington-d-c-live-at-930-club-out-november-12th/ |title=ALBUM ANNOUNCE // Yeasayer 'Good Evening Washington D.C., Live at 9:30 Club' Out November 12th |date=29 October 2013 |website=[[Secretly Canadian]] |access-date=19 January 2015}}</ref>

===''Amen & Goodbye''===
On January 7, 2016 the band announced that they would release their album called ''[[Amen & Goodbye]]'' on April 1, 2016. They also released a video for the song "[[I Am Chemistry]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/62708-yeasayer-announce-new-album-amen-goodbye-unleash-crazy-i-am-chemistry-video/|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|title=Yeasayer Announce New Album Amen & Goodbye, Unleash Crazy "I Am Chemistry" Video|date=7 January 2016}}</ref>

On February 10, 2016 Yeasayer released a music video that explored the set on which the album art was shot, as well as new single "Prophecy Gun." The music video included sculptures of public figures such as [[Donald Trump]], [[Caitlyn Jenner]], and [[Mark Twain]], and was described by the band as "[[Sgt. Pepper]] meets [[Hieronymous Bosch]] meets [[Salvador Dalí|Dali]] meets [[Pee-Wee's Playhouse]]."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pagano|first1=Weston|title=Take a Bizarre Trip Through Yeasayer's 'Amen & Goodbye' Album Art in New "Prophecy Gun" Music Video|url=http://www.transversomedia.com/articles//take-a-bizarre-trip-through-yeasayers-amen-goodbye-album-art-in-new-music-video-for-unnamed-single|website=Transverso Media|publisher=Transverso Media|access-date=February 10, 2016}}</ref>

On March 2, 2016 the band released the third single "Silly Me," a track with a decidedly more pop inspired sound described by the trio as being "from a different spectrum."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transversomedia.com/articles//yeasayer-drop-new-single-silly-me-announce-tour|title=Yeasayer Drops New Single "Silly Me," Announces Tour|work=TRANSVERSO}}</ref>

===''Erotic Reruns''===
On April 10, 2019 the band announced their fifth album ''[[Erotic Reruns]]''. The album was released on June 7, 2019 via their own Yeasayer Records.<ref name="er">{{cite web |last1=Blais-Billie |first1=Braudie |title=Yeasayer Announce New Album Erotic Reruns, Share New Songs: Listen |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/yeasayer-announce-new-album-erotic-reruns-share-new-songs-listen/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=April 10, 2019 |date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>
===Split===
The band announced it had split via its social media accounts on December 19, 2019, with the statement: “We have decided that Yeasayer has reached its end.”{{cn|date=July 2021}}

==Influences==
Yeasayer's leader Chris Keating stated he got "a lot of inspiration and lyrics from books that I've read, poetry, or lines from a movie. Art is a constant back and forth, everyone is responding to someone else. Every song that you think is an original idea, someday you’re going to come across something in a children’s book that has the exact words you heard in your favorite song on the radio. Art is constantly curating this vast history of music, art and literature." Keating has cited as other music genres and artists that inspired him, [[Mystikal]], [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], [[Talk Talk]], [[Dead Can Dance]] and classical music.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.instyle.com/awards-events/yeasayer-what-its-really-perform-music-festival |title=Yeasayer on What It's Really Like To Perform at a Music Festival |first=Liana |last=Gergely |work=Instyle.com |date=23 May 2016 |access-date=23 May 2016}}</ref>
