==History==
Xentrix were called Sweet Vengeance from 1984 to 1988.<ref name="riffrelevant"/> The band attracted attention with a five-star rating from ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine, and [[Roadrunner Records]] then contacted the band asking them why they had not been sent a copy, and arranged an audition with the band. After the audition, the band was signed to the label and recorded their first album ''Shattered Existence'' in the summer of 1989.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> The band toured with [[Sabbat (English band)|Sabbat]] in support of the album.<ref name="metalunderground">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=90293|title=Sunday Old School: Xentrix|publisher=metalunderground.com|date=March 24, 2013|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref>

In 1990, the band faced a small bit of controversy/publicity surrounding the release of their cover of [[Ray Parker, Jr.]]'s "[[Ghostbusters (song)|Ghostbusters]]" theme, in which the original artwork for the single had an unauthorized use of the Ghostbusters logo (with the ghost [[Finger (gesture)|flicking]] a [[V Sign]]).<ref name="LarkinHM"/> The single was subsequently re-released using a different cover.<ref name="LarkinHM"/>

The band also reached new heights when they opened for [[Bay Area thrash metal]] band [[Testament (band)|Testament]]. Later that year they recorded their second album ''[[For Whose Advantage?]]'',<ref name="LarkinHM"/> which gained them yet more interest and their first music video for the album's title track. Xentrix promoted ''For Whose Advantage?'' with a tour with [[Skyclad (band)|Skyclad]], and also played shows with bands like [[Slayer]] and [[Sepultura]].<ref name="metalunderground"/>

In 1992, the band decided to take a different direction with their album ''[[Kin (Xentrix album)|Kin]]'', adopting a more progressive [[power metal]] style with their music,<ref name="LarkinHM"/> which was considered by many{{who|date=November 2019}} to be the band's biggest mistake. Despite the critical acclaim, a video for "The Order of Chaos" was shot and received some airplay on [[MTV]], and to promote the album, Xentrix went on tour with [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]].<ref name="metalunderground"/>

After a hiatus and replacing Chris Astley with Simon Gordon and Andy Rudd on vocals and guitar respectively, Xentrix resurfaced in 1996 with their fourth album ''[[Scourge (album)|Scourge]]''. The band broke up shortly after its release, citing the decline in popularity in the British metal scene as the reason.<ref name="metalunderground"/>

In 2005, Xentrix announced that they would be reuniting with its classic line-up for a small number of dates. They played a handful of shows in the UK in the spring of 2006, including one with then-recently reunited [[Onslaught (band)|Onslaught]] and [[Evile]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/u-k-thrashers-xentrix-to-reunite-for-two-exclusive-gigs/|title=U.K. Thrashers XENTRIX To Reunite For Two Exclusive Gigs|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 12, 2006|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/onslaught-to-play-one-off-u-k-date-with-testament-xentrix/|title=ONSLAUGHT To Play One-Off U.K. Date With TESTAMENT, XENTRIX|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 11, 2006|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/testament-will-not-play-u-k-in-june-xentrix-and-others-to-continue-with-gig/|title=TESTAMENT Will NOT Play U.K. In June; XENTRIX And Others To Continue With Gig|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 18, 2006|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref> Despite the positive response to those two shows, Xentrix announced that September that they had once again split up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/xentrix-we-have-decided-not-to-do-any-more-shows/|title=XENTRIX: 'We Have Decided Not To Do Any More Shows'|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=September 2, 2006|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref>

On 4 February 2013, it was announced via [[Evile]]'s [[Facebook]] page that a reunited Xentrix would be joining [[Kreator]] and Evile for a three-show UK tour in late April.<ref name=Evile>{{cite web|title=2013 UK tour announcement|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151316629817909&set=a.332239397908.148639.10276797908&type=1|website=Facebook.com|access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> This was initially the full ''[[Shattered Existence]]'' lineup, but later in the year bassist Paul MacKenzie left, to be replaced by Chris Shires. On 15 February, the band announced that they had new material in the works.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reunited Xentrix Booking Shows, Preparing To Write New Music|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=186306|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref>

Select shows continued in early 2014, and at the Up The Hammers Festival in Athens, Greece on 8 March, they played new song "World of Mouth" for the first time, and included it in their set supporting [[Overkill (band)|Overkill]] on their UK tour, starting in London on 13 March. In October 2015, Xentrix embarked on a six-date UK tour with a reunited [[Acid Reign]] and Shrapnel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.xentrix.co.uk/|title=Xentrix|website=Xentrix.co.uk|access-date=27 November 2019}}</ref>

On 14 July 2017, it was announced that Xentrix had once again parted ways with Chris Astley and replaced him with Jay Walsh.<ref>{{cite web|title=XENTRIX Parts Ways With Guitarist/Vocalist CHRIS ASTLEY, Announces Replacement|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/xentrix-parts-ways-with-guitaristvocalist-chris-astley-announces-replacement/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=July 15, 2017|access-date=July 15, 2017}}</ref>

In a June 2019 interview with Metal Crypt, guitarist Kristian Havard revealed that Xentrix had already begun writing the follow-up to ''Bury the Pain''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalcrypt.com/pages/interviews.php?intid=626|title=The Metal Crypt - Xentrix Interview|publisher=metalcrypt.com|date=June 2, 2019|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref> By March 2021, the band had written and demoed at least twelve songs for their new album,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=41467|title=Xentrix - Working On Sixth Album|publisher=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=March 26, 2021|date=March 26, 2021}}</ref> and announced that August they were in the studio recording it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=43108|title=Xentrix - In The Studio|publisher=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=August 24, 2021|date=August 24, 2021}}</ref>
