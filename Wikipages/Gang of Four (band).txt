'''Gang of Four''' is an English [[post-punk]] band, formed in 1976 in [[Leeds]].<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/gang-of-four-mn0000193231|title=Gang of Four – Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=20 April 2019}}</ref> The original members were singer [[Jon King]], guitarist [[Andy Gill]], bass guitarist [[Dave Allen (English musician)|Dave Allen]] and drummer [[Hugo Burnham]]. There have been many different line-ups including, among other notable musicians, [[Sara Lee (musician)|Sara Lee]], [[Mark Heaney]] and [[Gail Ann Dorsey]]. After a brief lull in the 1980s, different constellations of the band recorded two studio albums in the 1990s. Between 2004 and 2006 the original line-up was reunited; Gill toured using the name between 2012 and his death in 2020. In 2021, the band announced that King, Burnham and Lee would be reuniting for a tour in 2022 with [[David Pajo]] on guitar.

The band played a stripped-down mix of [[punk rock]], [[funk]] and [[Dub music|dub]], with a lyrical emphasis on the social and political ills of society. Gang of Four are widely considered one of the leading bands of the late 1970s/early 1980s post-punk movement. Their debut album, ''[[Entertainment!]]'', was ranked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as the fifth greatest punk album of all time<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/40-greatest-punk-albums-of-all-time-20160406/gang-of-four-entertainment-1979-20160406|title=40 Greatest Punk Albums of All Time|access-date=4 November 2016|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> and at number 483 in their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. In 2004, the album was listed by [[Pitchfork Media]] as the 8th best album of the 1970s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/5932-top-100-albums-of-the-1970s/10/ |title=Staff Lists: Top 100 Albums of the 1970s &#124; Features |website=Pitchfork.com |date=23 June 2004 |access-date=19 February 2012}}</ref> and, in 2020, by ''Pop Matters'' as "Best Post Punk album ever".<ref>Fitzgerald, Colin, [https://www.popmatters.com/best-post-punk-albums-5-2495402671.html "The 50 Best Post-Punk Albums Ever: Part 5, Joy Division to Gang of Four"], PopMatters.com, 10 April 2020.</ref> Their early 80s albums (''[[Songs of the Free]]'' and ''[[Hard (Gang of Four album)|Hard]]'') found them softening some of their more jarring qualities, and drifting towards [[dance-punk]] and [[disco]]. David Fricke of ''Rolling Stone'' described Gang of Four as  "probably the best politically motivated band in rock & roll.".<ref>David Fricke, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 7 August 1980.</ref>

==History==
=== Early years and ''Entertainment!'' (1976-1979) ===
The band initially consisted of vocalist [[Jon King]], guitarist [[Andy Gill]], drummer [[Hugo Burnham]] and bass guitarist Dave Wolfson.<ref name="lester25">{{Cite book|last=Lester|first=Paul|title=Gang of Four: Damaged Gods|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|year=2008|pages=25–26|isbn=978-1-84772-245-4}}</ref> After two or three gigs,<ref name="lester25"/> Wolfson was replaced with [[Dave Allen (English musician)|Dave Allen]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://repeaterbooks.com/product/red-set-a-history-of-gang-of-four/|title=Red Set: A History of Gang of Four |website=Repeaterbooks.com|access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref>

Gang of Four's music brought together an eclectic array of influences, ranging from the [[Frankfurt School]] of social criticism to the increasingly clear trans-Atlantic [[punk rock|punk]] consensus.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} Gang of Four was named by Andy Corrigan, a member of [[the Mekons]], while driving around with Gill and King when he came upon a newspaper billboard on the intra-[[Communist Party of China|Party]] [[coup d'état|coup]] against China's "[[Gang of Four]]".<ref name="auto"/>

The band's debut single, "[[Damaged Goods (song)|Damaged Goods]]" backed with "(Love Like) Anthrax" and "Armalite Rifle", was recorded in June 1978 and released on 10 December 1978, on [[Edinburgh]]'s [[Fast Product]] label. It was a Number 1 [[indie rock|indie]] chart hit<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.superplayer.fm/gang-of-four| title=Gang of Four – Superplayer, músicas para ouvir | access-date=4 November 2016 | website=Superplayer.fm |language=es}}</ref> and [[John Peel]] radio show favourite. Damaged Goods was voted one of the 100 Greatest debut singles of all time in 2020's Rolling Stone Poll<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/greatest-debut-songs-singles-990470/|title=The 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time|first1=Rob |last1=Sheffield |first2=et|last2=al|website=Rollingstone.com|date=19 May 2020|access-date=11 September 2020}}</ref>  Two Peel radio sessions followed, which, with their incendiary live performances, propelled the band to international attention and sold-out shows across Europe and North America. They were then signed by [[EMI]] records. The group's debut single with this label, "At Home He's a Tourist", charted in 1979. Invited to appear on top rated [[BBC]] music program ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', the band walked off the show when the BBC told them to sing "rubbish" in the place of the original lyric "rubbers", as the original line was considered too risque. The single was then banned by BBC Radio and TV, which lost the band some support at EMI. King's lyrics were always controversial and a later single, "I Love a Man in a Uniform", was banned by the BBC during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/5R152hTbVPQdYjn29q5jt4/16-songs-banned-by-the-bbc|title=16 songs banned by the BBC|access-date=4 November 2016|publisher=BBC Four}}</ref>

Critic Stewart Mason has called "Anthrax" not only the group's "most notorious song" but also "one of the most unique and interesting songs of its time".<ref name="allmusic-Anthrax">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t778569|pure_url=yes}} |title=Anthrax |access-date=26 August 2008 |last=Mason |first=Stewart |format=DLL |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> It's also a good example of Gang of Four's social perspective: after a minute-long, [[drone (music)|droning]], [[audio feedback|feedback]]-laced guitar intro, the [[rhythm section]] sets up a funky, churning beat, and the guitar drops out entirely. In one stereo channel, King sings a "post-punk anti-love song",<ref name="allmusic-Anthrax" /> comparing himself to a beetle trapped on its back ("and there's no way for me to get up") and equating love with "a case of [[anthrax]], and that's some thing I don't want to catch." Meanwhile, in the other stereo channel (and slightly less prominent in the mix), Gill reads (on the original EP version) a detailed account of the technical resources used on the song, which on the re-recorded album version is replaced by a [[deadpan]] [[monologue]] about public perception of love and the prevalence of love songs in popular music: "Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about 'cause most groups make most of their songs about falling in love, or how happy they are to be in love; and you occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time." Although the two sets of lyrics tell independent stories they occasionally synchronise for emphasis.

According to critic [[Paul Morley]], "The Gang spliced the ferocious precision of [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]]'s working-class blues with the testing avant-garde intrigue of [[Henry Cow]]. Wilfully avoiding structural obviousness, melodic prettiness and harmonic corniness, the Gang's music was studded with awkward holes and sharp corners."<ref>"The Jam, Gang of Four: Music Machine, London" Paul Morley, New Musical Express, 6 January 1979</ref> At the time, the band was recognised to be doing something very different from other white guitar acts. Ken Tucker, in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', 1980, wrote: "...rarely have the radical edges of black and white music come closer to overlapping... the Gang of Four utilize their bass guitar every bit as prominently and starkly as the curt bass figures that prod the spoken verses in <!-- don't correct parens to square brackets, it breaks the link coding -->([[Kurtis Blow]]'s "culture defining" huge summer hit) "[[The Breaks (song)|The Breaks]]."

=== Later years (1980-1983) ===
In 1981, the band released their second LP, ''[[Solid Gold (album)|Solid Gold]]''. Like ''[[Entertainment!]]'', the album was uncompromising, spare, and analytical. King's lyrics in such songs as "Cheeseburger," "He'd Send in the Army," and "In the Ditch" exposed the paradoxes of warfare, work, and leisure. Van Gosse, in a ''[[The Village Voice|Village Voice]]'' review said: "Gang of Four embody a new category in pop, which illuminates all the others, because the motor of their aesthetic is not a 'personal creative vision.'"

Dave Allen (who later co-founded [[Shriekback]], [[King Swamp]], [[Low Pop Suicide]] and [[the Elastic Purejoy]]) had left in 1981, and had been briefly replaced by [[Busta Jones|Busta "Cherry" Jones]], a sometime player with [[Parliament (band)|Parliament]], [[Brian Eno]], and [[Talking Heads]]. After working with the Gang to complete their North American tour obligations, Jones left and was replaced by [[Sara Lee (musician)|Sara Lee]], who was [[Robert Fripp]]'s bassist in [[the League of Gentlemen (band)|the League of Gentlemen]]. Lee was as good a singer as bassist, and she helped give the band's third studio album, ''[[Songs of the Free]]'', a more commercially accessible element. Although "I Love a Man in a Uniform" from the album was the band's most radio-friendly song, it was banned in the UK shortly after its release because Britain went to war in the Falkland Islands. In the spring of 1983, Burnham left the band after the release of ''Songs of the Free'' and formed [[Illustrated Man (band)|Illustrated Man]]. Gill and King continued Gang of Four, releasing ''[[Hard (Gang of Four album)|Hard]]'' in 1983.

After that, the band broke up, and Lee moved to the United States where she has worked with a number of artists, including [[the B-52's]].

1986 saw the release of ''The Peel Sessions'', a collection of rawly rendered material recorded during the period 1979 to 1981 for British radio BBC. [[Melody Maker]] dubbed the album "a perfect and classic nostalgia trip into the world of gaunt cynicism."

=== Gill and King reunion (1987-1997) ===
Gill and King reunited to record ''[[Mall (album)|Mall]]'' in 1991, and finally ''[[Shrinkwrapped (album)|Shrinkwrapped]]'' in 1995. ''Mall'' featured [[Gail Ann Dorsey]], later famous for her longtime association with [[David Bowie]], on bass.

=== Changing line-ups (2004-2012) ===
The original lineup of Jon King, Andy Gill, Dave Allen and Hugo Burnham reformed in November 2004. A UK tour in January 2005, shows in Europe and Japan and tours of the United States in May/June and again in September. In October 2005, Gang of Four released a new disc featuring new recordings of songs from the albums ''Entertainment!'', ''Solid Gold'' and ''Songs of the Free'' entitled ''Return the Gift'' (which featured Mark Heaney on drums) accompanied by an album's worth of remixes.

In January 2011, the band, now featuring Mark Heaney on drums, and Thomas McNeice on bass, released a new album, ''[[Content (Gang of Four album)|Content]]'', which was called "their best record since the Seventies".<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/cdreviews/8274881/Gang-of-Four-Content-CD-review.html | location=London | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | first=Andrew | last=Perry | title=Gang of Four: Content, CD review | date=21 January 2011}}</ref> Jon Pareles, in a ''New York Times'' 4-star review, declared that [the band] "have reclaimed, with a vengeance, their old attack".<ref>{{cite news| title= Critics' Choice: New CDs| url=http://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/2011/01/25/arts/music/25choice.html | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | first1=Ben | last1=Ratliff | first2=Nate | last2=Chinen | first3=Jon | last3=Pareles | date=24 Jan 2011}}</ref>
Following successful tours of the US, Australia and Europe in 2011, King and Gill disagreed about the band's direction and ceased working together.

=== Final line-up with Gill (2012-2020) ===
[[File:Andy Gill and John "Gaoler" Sterry, Gang of Four.jpeg|thumb|right|Gang of Four in 2014: Andy Gill (left) and John "Gaoler" Sterry]]
Gill, against the wishes of King, continued to tour and record under the Gang of Four name. With new lead vocalist John Sterry, as well as a returning McNiece, the band released ''What Happens Next'' in 2015, ''Complicit'' in 2018, and ''Happy Now'' in 2019, which featured a range of guest artists. XSNoise said "The album [Happy Now] is as intense as any ever released on their discography."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.xsnoize.com/album-review-gang-of-four-happy-now/ |title=ALBUM REVIEW: Gang of Four - Happy Now &#124; XS Noize &#124; Online Music Magazine |website=Xsnoize.com |access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

Andy Gill died on 1 February 2020, and obituaries across the world hailed his legacy and impact. He was "one of the most influential musicians of the post-punk era, leading his band Gang of Four to huge acclaim with his intense, angular, staccato guitar work that blended rock with funk," said the ''Independent''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Garth Cartwright |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/andy-gill-death-gang-of-four-guitarist-post-punk-age-cause-music-a9316481.html |title=Andy Gill: Gang of Four founder whose jagged guitar sound spawned many imitators |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=2020-02-07 |access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> Gang of Four's "brusque, angular style would directly or indirectly influence post-punk and indie-rock bands like [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] (who chose Mr. Gill to produce their debut album), [[The Jesus Lizard]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] and [[Protomartyr (band)|Protomartyr]]," said the ''New York Times'', adding: "[[Michael Hutchence]] of [[INXS]] once said that Gang of Four’s music 'took no prisoners,' adding, 'It was art meets the devil via [[James Brown]].'"<ref>{{cite web|author=Jon Pareles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/arts/music/andy-gill-dead.html |title=Andy Gill, Radical Guitarist With Gang of Four, Dies at 64 - The New York Times |website=Nytimes.com |date=1956-01-01 |access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> The NME wrote: "Great musicians encapsulate their age; the very best echo endlessly onwards, and Andy Gill...has been reverberating along the baseline of alternative culture for 40 years."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/andy-gill-obituary-1956-2020-gang-of-four-2604037|title=Andy Gill – the NME obituary, 1956-2020: The guitar hero who made radical politics danceable|website=Nme.com|date=1 February 2020}}</ref>

==Legacy==

Gang of Four influenced a number of successful alternative rock acts throughout the 1980s and 1990s. [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]] frontman [[Michael Stipe]] cites Gang of Four as one of his band's chief influences;<ref>{{cite book|last=Lester|first=Paul|title=Gang of Four|year=2008|publisher=Music Sales Group|page=1|isbn=9781847722454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9ApoM5GTpq0C}}</ref> [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] of the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] has stated that Gang of Four were the single most important influence on his band's early music. [[Kurt Cobain]] stated that [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] started as "a Gang of Four and [[Scratch Acid]] ripoff". Gang of Four's debut album ''Entertainment!'' was ranked 13th in [[Kurt Cobain]]'s list of his 50 favourite albums in his [[Journals (Cobain)|journal]].<ref name="joyfulnoiserecordings.com">{{cite web|title=Top 50 by Nirvana [MIXTAPE] |url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |access-date=8 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018034220/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |archive-date=18 October 2014  }}</ref> Andy Kellman, writing in [[AllMusic]], argued that Gang of Four's "germs of influence" can be found in many [[rap metal]] groups "not in touch with their ancestry enough to realize it".<ref>{{cite web

From the 2000s, the band enjoyed a resurgence in popularity, initially due to emergence of new [[post-punk revival]] bands such as [[Clinic (band)|Clinic]], [[Liars (band)|Liars]], [[the Rapture (band)|the Rapture]], [[Neils Children]] and [[Radio 4 (band)|Radio 4]], and then the rise of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[We Are Scientists]] and [[Bloc Party]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/from-rhcp-to-st-vincent-16-great-bands-influenced-by-gang-of-four/|title=From RHCP to St. Vincent, 16 great bands influenced by Gang of Four|website=Brooklynvegan.com|access-date=13 March 2021}}</ref>
