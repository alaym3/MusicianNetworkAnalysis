==Early life==
Weekes was born in the small town of [[Verona, Missouri]], near a large Amish community. He is the second of four children and was raised in a [[Mormon]] family in [[Clearfield, Utah]], where his parents moved shortly after he was born. Weekes attended [[Clearfield High School]], where he met most of his former Brobecks bandmates. After graduating with honors in 1999, Weekes served as a full-time [[Mormon Missionary]] in [[Oklahoma]] for two years. After returning home he shortly attended [[Weber State University]] before dropping out to pursue music full-time.

==Music career==
===The Brobecks (2002–2013)===
The band began as a weekend hobby for Weekes shortly after he returned to Utah after living in Oklahoma for two years. The group's name was inspired by a person from Dallon's school days. The original line-up consisted of Weekes, photographer/producer [[Matt Glass]] and another friend from high school.  After a few years of recording basement demos, touring and line-up changes, the band was offered a contract from an imprint of [[Drive-Thru Records]], and Weekes was offered solo record contracts by [[Sony BMG]], [[Interscope Records]], and a smaller indie label if he would drop his bandmates. Weekes declined.

The Brobecks opened for bands such as Fall Out Boy, Phantom Planet, Ben Kweller, and The Bravery.  Despite all the label interest and album success for an indie band, the band remained independent and unsigned.

In late 2012, Weekes released the ''Quiet Title EP'' for download on his Bandcamp page for The Brobecks, as well as an option to purchase a physical copy of the Violent Things Reissue CD. The ''Quiet Title EP'' consists of two songs, "Anyone I Know" and "Cluster Hug", featuring [[Ian Crawford (musician)|Ian Crawford]] on guitar and recorded/edited with help from former Brobecks drummer, [[Matt Glass]]. In November 2012, Weekes stated in an interview with [[Salt Lake City]]'s [[X96]] radio station that these songs were written during the songwriting and recording process for Panic's fourth studio album, but did not fit with their collective vision for the new record.

===Panic! at the Disco (2009–2017)===
[[File:Dallon Weekes of Panic! at the Disco.jpg|thumbnail|left|Weekes performing with [[Panic! at the Disco]] in 2011]]
After the departure of [[Ryan Ross]] and [[Jon Walker]] in 2009, Weekes and [[Ian Crawford (musician)|Ian Crawford]] were hired to replace Ross and Walker for [[Panic! at the Disco]] on a temporary, touring basis for their second studio album ''[[Pretty. Odd.]]'' (2008).<ref>{{cite web|title=Exclusive: Spencer Smith Reveals New Members of Panic!
