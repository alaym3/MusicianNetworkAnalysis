== Life and career ==
Desmond Mendize was born in [[Rio Bueno, Jamaica]] on April 6, 1980. He started his ascent at singing competitions at the age of five. He attended Rio Bueno Primary and High School.<ref name="dancehallreggaeworld"/>

Mendize has been part of the Warlord International and [[Bass Odyssey]] sound systems. As Tony Mentol, he made his recorded debut in 2004 with the single "Woman It's You".<ref name="billboard">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/7394958/charly-black/biography|publisher=billboard.com|title=Charly Black - Biography &#124; Billboard|accessdate=2016-12-04|archive-date=2016-12-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221032231/http://www.billboard.com/artist/7394958/charly-black/biography|url-status=live}}</ref> He eventually switched aliases to Charly Black and recorded a string of cuts for labels like Coppershot, M Bass, and VP, the last of which issued "Buddy Buddy" in 2008. In 2014, he recorded his most successful single, "Gyal You a Party Animal", then simply known as "Party Animal". The song, based on Kurt Riley's Jambe-An [[riddim]],<ref name="billboard"/> gradually spread outside Jamaica to win over audiences across South America. It was licensed worldwide by [[Allezgo productions|Allezgo Productions]] and for the [[United States|US]] by [[Casablanca Records]] in early 2016, followed by the release of a music video for the song on [[YouTube]] months later. It has since received over 100 million streams on [[Spotify]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The song has also been remixed by other foreign music artists, including [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]], [[Daddy Yankee]], and [[Jillionaire]].
