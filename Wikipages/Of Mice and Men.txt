'''''Of Mice and Men''''' is a [[novella]] written by [[John Steinbeck]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxnotes.com/of-mice-and-men-summary.html|title=Of Mice and Men Summary|website=OxNotes GCSE Revision|language=en|access-date=2018-10-10}}</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12829392 Who, what, why: Why do children study Of Mice and Men?] on BBC</ref> Published in 1937, it narrates the experiences of George Milton and Lennie Small, two displaced [[migrant worker|migrant]] [[ranch]] workers, who move from place to place in [[California]] in search of new job opportunities during the [[Great Depression]] in the [[United States]].

Steinbeck based the novella on his own experiences working alongside migrant farm workers as a teenager in the 1910s (before the arrival of the [[Okie]]s that he would describe in ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]''). The title is taken from [[Robert Burns]]' poem "[[To a Mouse]]", which reads: "The best laid schemes o' mice an' men / Gang aft agley". (The best laid schemes of mice and men / Often go awry.)

While it is a book taught in many schools,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12829392 |title=Who, what, why: Why do children study Of Mice and Men? |author=Stephen Maunder |date= March 25, 2011|work=BBC News  |access-date=March 26, 2011}}</ref> ''Of Mice and Men'' has been a frequent target of [[censorship|censors]] for vulgarity, and what some consider offensive and racist language; consequently, it appears on the [[American Library Association]]'s list of the ''Most Challenged Books of the 21st Century''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ala.org/ala/issuesadvocacy/banned/frequentlychallenged/challengedbydecade/2000_2009/index.cfm |title=American Library Association Top 100 Banned/Challenged Books: 2000–2009 |year=2011 |work=web page |publisher=American Library Association |access-date= July 1, 2011}}</ref>

==Plot==
Two migrant field workers in California on their plantation during the Great Depression—George Milton, an intelligent but uneducated man, and Lennie Small, a bulky, strong man but [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]]—are in [[Soledad, California|Soledad]] on their way to another part of California. They hope to one day attain the dream of settling down on their own piece of land. Lennie's part of the dream is merely to tend and pet [[rabbit]]s on the farm, as he loves touching soft animals, although he always accidentally kills them. This dream is one of Lennie's favorite stories, which George constantly retells. They had fled from [[Weed, California|Weed]] after Lennie grabbed a young woman's skirt and would not let go, leading to an accusation of [[rape]]. It soon becomes clear that the two are close and George is Lennie's protector, despite his antics.

After being hired at a farm, the pair are confronted by Curley—the Boss's small, aggressive son with a [[Napoleon complex]] who dislikes larger men. Curley starts to target Lennie. Curley's flirtatious and provocative underaged wife, to whom Lennie is instantly attracted, poses a problem as well. In contrast, the pair also meets Candy, an elderly ranch handyman with one hand and a loyal dog, and Slim, an intelligent and gentle [[Muleteer|jerkline-skinner]] whose dog has recently had a [[Litter (animal)|litter]] of puppies. Slim gives a puppy to Lennie and Candy, whose loyal, accomplished sheep dog was [[Animal euthanasia|put down]] by fellow ranch-hand Carlson.

In spite of problems, their dream leaps towards reality when Candy offers to pitch in $350 with George and Lennie so that they can buy a farm at the end of the month, in return for permission to live with them. The trio are ecstatic, but their joy is overshadowed when Curley attacks Lennie, who defends himself by easily crushing Curley's fist while urged on by George.

Nevertheless, George feels more relaxed, to the extent that he even leaves Lennie behind on the ranch while he goes into town with the other ranch hands. Lennie wanders into the stable, and chats with Crooks, the bitter, yet educated stable buck, who is isolated from the other workers due to being black. Candy finds them and they discuss their plans for the farm with Crooks, who cannot resist asking them if he can hoe a garden patch on the farm albeit scorning its possibility. Curley's wife makes another appearance and flirts with the men, especially Lennie. However, her spiteful side is shown when she belittles them and threatens to have Crooks [[lynching|lynched]].

The next day, Lennie accidentally kills his puppy while stroking it. Curley's wife enters the barn and tries to speak to Lennie, admitting that she is lonely and how her dreams of becoming a movie star are crushed, revealing her personality. After finding out about Lennie's habit, she offers to let him stroke her hair, but panics and begins to scream when she feels his strength. Lennie becomes frightened, and unintentionally breaks her neck thereafter and runs away. When the other ranch hands find the corpse, they form into a lynch mob intent on killing him, then send for the police before beginning the search. George then quickly realizes that their dream is at an end and hurries to find Lennie, hoping he will be at the meeting place they designated in case he got into trouble (the riverbank where they camped at the start of the book).

George meets Lennie at their camping spot before they came to the ranch. The two sit together and George retells the beloved story of the dream, despite knowing it is something they will never share. Upon hearing the lynch mob near them, George shoots Lennie, knowing it to be a more merciful death than that at the hands of a mob. Curley, Slim, and Carlson arrive seconds after. Only Slim realizes what happened, and consolingly leads him away. Curley and Carlson look on, unable to comprehend the subdued mood of the two men.

==Characters==

* '''George Milton:''' A quick-witted man who is Lennie's guardian and best friend. His friendship with Lennie helps sustain his dream of a better future. He was bound in teasing Lennie since he was young.{{explain|date=October 2020}} He is described by Steinbeck in the novel as "small and quick", every part of him being "defined", with small strong hands on slender arms. He has a dark face and "restless eyes" and "sharp, strong features" including a "thin, bony nose".
* '''Lennie Small''': A [[Developmental disability|mentally disabled]], but gigantic and physically strong man who travels with George and is his constant companion.<ref name="nyt-parini">{{Cite journal|last=Parini|first=Jay|author-link=Jay Parini|date=1992-09-27|title=FILM; Of Bindlestiffs, Bad Times, Mice and Men|journal=The New York Times|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE6DD1F3AF934A1575AC0A964958260&sec=&spon=&pagewanted=all|access-date=June 17, 2008}}</ref> He dreams of "living off the fatta' the lan'" and being able to tend to rabbits. His love for soft things is a weakness, mostly because he does not know his own strength, and eventually becomes his undoing. Steinbeck defines his appearance as George's "opposite", writing that he is a "huge man, shapeless of face, with large, pale eyes" and "wide, sloping shoulders". Lennie walks heavily, dragging his feet a little, "the way a bear drags his paws," adding that his arms do not swing at his sides, but hang loosely.
* '''Candy''': An aging ranch handyman, Candy lost his hand in an accident and worries about his future on the ranch. Fearing that his age is making him useless, he seizes on George's description of the farm he and Lennie will have, offering his life's savings if he can join George and Lennie in owning the land.
* '''Slim''': A "jerkline skinner," the main driver of a [[mule]] team and the "prince of the ranch". Slim is greatly respected by many of the characters and is the only character whom Curley treats with respect. His insight, intuition, kindness and natural authority draw the other ranch hands automatically towards him, and he is significantly the only character to fully understand the bond between George and Lennie. Slim is considered the "{{wikt-lang|en|übermensch|i=-}}"<ref>{{cite book |last=Barden |first=Tom |title=Of Mice and Meaning in John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men |publisher=Critical Insights: Of Mice & Men |date=May 2017}}</ref> of this story by the god-like descriptions of Slim that he is the one that knows best out of the cast.
* '''Curley''': The Boss' son, a young, pugnacious character, once a semi-professional boxer. He is described by others, with some irony, as "handy", partly because he likes to keep a glove filled with [[vaseline]] on his left hand. He is very jealous and protective of his wife and immediately develops a dislike toward Lennie. At one point, Curley loses his temper after he sees Lennie appear to laugh at him, and ends up with his hand horribly damaged after Lennie fights back against him.
* '''Curley's wife''': A young, pretty woman, who is mistrusted by her husband. The other characters refer to her only as "Curley's wife". Steinbeck explained that she is "not a person, she's a symbol. She has no function, except to be a foil&nbsp;– and a danger to Lennie."<ref name="nyt-parini" /> Curley's wife's preoccupation with her own beauty eventually helps precipitate her death: She allows Lennie to stroke her hair as an apparently harmless indulgence, only for her to upset Lennie when she yells at him to stop him "mussing it". Lennie tries to stop her yelling and eventually, and accidentally, kills her by breaking her neck.
* '''Crooks''': Crooks, the black stable-hand, gets his name from his crooked back. Proud, bitter, and cynical, he is isolated from the other men because of the color of his skin. Despite himself, Crooks becomes fond of Lennie, and though he claims to have seen countless men following empty dreams of buying their own land, he asks Lennie if he can go with them and hoe in the garden. Crooks is a more relatable individual who sees things from a more rational and human perspective.
* '''Candy's dog''': A blind dog who is described as "old", "stinky", and "crippled", and is killed by Carlson.
* '''Carlson''': A "thick bodied" ranch hand, he kills Candy's dog with little sympathy.
* '''The Boss''': Curley's father, the superintendent of the ranch. The ranch is owned by "a big land company" according to Candy.
* '''Whit''': A young ranch hand.

{{quotation|In every bit of honest writing in the world there is a base theme. Try to understand men, if you understand each other you will be kind to each other.

Steinbeck emphasizes dreams throughout the book.{{Clarify|date=December 2017}} George aspires to become independent, to be his own boss, to have a homestead, and, most important, to be "somebody". Lennie aspires to be with George on his independent homestead, and to quench his [[Fixation (psychology)|fixation]] on soft objects. Candy aspires to reassert his responsibility lost with the death of his dog, and for security for his old age—on George's homestead. Crooks aspires to a small homestead where he can express self-respect, security, and most of all, acceptance. Curley's wife dreams to be an actress, to satisfy her desire for fame lost when she married Curley, and an end to her loneliness.

Loneliness is a significant factor in several characters' lives. Candy is lonely after his dog is gone. Curley's wife is lonely because her husband is not the friend she hoped for—she deals with her loneliness by flirting with the men on the ranch, which causes Curley to increase his abusiveness and jealousy. The companionship of George and Lennie is the result of loneliness. Crooks states the theme candidly as "A guy goes nuts if he ain't got anybody. Don't make any difference who the guy is, long's he's with you."<ref>Of Mice and Men, p. 71</ref> The author further reinforces this theme through subtle methods by situating the story near the town of [[Soledad, California|Soledad]], which means "solitude" in Spanish.<ref name="cliffnotebook">{{cite book

Despite the need for companionship, Steinbeck emphasizes how loneliness is sustained through the barriers established from acting inhuman to one another. The loneliness of Curley's wife is upheld by Curley's jealousy, which causes all the ranch hands to avoid her. Crooks's barrier results from being barred from the bunkhouse by restraining him to the [[stable]]; his bitterness is partially broken, however, through Lennie's ignorance.

Steinbeck's characters are often powerless, due to intellectual, economic, and social circumstances. Lennie possesses the greatest physical strength of any character, which should therefore establish a sense of respect as he is employed as a ranch hand. However, his intellectual handicap undercuts this and results in his powerlessness. Economic powerlessness is established as many of the ranch hands are victims of the [[Great Depression]]. As George, Candy and Crooks are positive, action- oriented characters, they wish to purchase a homestead, but because of the Depression, they are unable to generate enough money. Lennie is the only one who is basically unable to take care of himself, but the other characters would do this in the improved circumstances they seek. Since they cannot do so, the real danger of Lennie's mental handicap comes to the fore.

Regarding human interaction, evil of oppression and abuse is a theme that is illustrated through Curley and Curley's wife. Curley uses his aggressive nature and superior position in an attempt to take control of his father's farm. He constantly reprimands the farm hands and accuses some of fooling around with his wife. Curley's [[Napoleon complex]] is evidenced by his threatening of the farm hands for minuscule incidents. Curley's wife, on the other hand, is not physically but verbally manipulative. She uses her sex appeal to gain some attention, flirting with the farm hands. According to the [[Penguin Group|Penguin]] Teacher's Guide for ''Of Mice and Men'', Curley and Curley's wife represent evil in that both oppress and abuse the migrants in different ways.<ref>{{cite book|last=Reed, Ph.D|first=Arthea J.S.|title=A Teacher's Guide to the Penguin Edition of John Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men|publisher=Penguin Group (USA)|url=http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/ofmiceandmen.pdf|access-date=2013-06-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916103326/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pdf/teachersguides/ofmiceandmen.pdf|archive-date=2012-09-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Fate is felt most heavily as the characters' aspirations are destroyed when George is unable to protect Lennie (who is a real danger). Steinbeck presents this as "something that happened" or as his friend coined for him "non-teleological thinking" or "is thinking", which postulates a non-judgmental point of view.<ref name="introshillinglaw">{{cite book

Of Mice and Men can be associated with the idea that inherent limitations exist and despite all the squirming and struggling, sometimes the circumstances of one's existence limits their capacity to live the fairy tale lives they wish to. Even the title of the novel itself references this "the title is, of course, a fragment from the poem lay Robert Burns, which gives emphasis to the idea of the futility of human endeavor or the vanity of human wishes".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Goldhurst |first=William |date=October 2017 |title=Of Mice and Men : John Steinbeck's Parable Of The Curse Of Cain |publisher=[[Western American Literature]] |volume=6 |issue=2}}</ref>

Animals play a role in the story as well; the heron shifts from a beautiful part of the scenery from the beginning of the novel to a predator near the end. The ending chapter has the Heron return, preying upon snakes that get too curious in a repetitive nature, symbolic of the dreams of men constantly being snatched away.

==Development==
''Of Mice and Men'' was Steinbeck's first attempt at writing in the form of novel-play termed a "play-novelette" by one critic. Structured in three acts of two chapters each, it is intended to be both a novella and a script for a play. It is only 30,000 words in length. Steinbeck wanted to write a novel that could be played from its lines, or a play that could be read like a novel.<ref name="BurningBright">[[Burning Bright]] – in the foreword Steinbeck states that Of Mice and Men and [[The Moon Is Down]] were his first two play yo man Shillinglaw {{cite web|title=John Steinbeck, American Writer|date=January 18, 2004|publisher=The Martha Heasley Cox Center for Steinbeck Studies|url=http://www.steinbeck.sjsu.edu/biography/briefbiography.jsp|access-date=December 28, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060908113639/http://steinbeck.sjsu.edu/biography/briefbiography.jsp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 8, 2006}}</ref>

Steinbeck originally titled it ''Something That Happened'' (referring to the events of the book as "something that happened" because nobody can be really blamed for the tragedy that unfolds in the story). However, he changed the title after reading [[Robert Burns]]'s poem ''[[To a Mouse]].''<ref name="Shillinglaw">{{cite web|author=Dr. Susan Shillinglaw |title=John Steinbeck, American Writer |date=January 18, 2004 |publisher=The Martha Heasley Cox Center for Steinbeck Studies |url=http://www.steinbeck.sjsu.edu/biography/briefbiography.jsp |access-date=December 28, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908113639/http://steinbeck.sjsu.edu/biography/briefbiography.jsp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = September 8, 2006}}</ref> Burns's poem tells of the regret the narrator feels for having destroyed the home of a mouse while plowing his field.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coyer|first=Megan|title=More About This Poem|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/robertburns/works/to_a_mouse/|work=Robert Burns - To a Mouse|publisher=BBC|access-date=26 May 2014}}</ref>

Steinbeck wrote this book and ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' in what is now [[Monte Sereno, California]]. An early draft of ''Of Mice and Men'' was eaten by Steinbeck's dog. As he explained in a 1936 letter:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Steinbeck|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/2511315|title=Steinbeck : a life in letters|date=1976|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-004288-1|location=New York|pages=124|oclc=2511315}}</ref><blockquote>My setter pup [Toby], left alone one night, made confetti of about half of my [manuscript] book. Two months [sic] work to do over again. It sets me back. There was no other draft. I was pretty mad, but the poor little fellow may have been acting critically.</blockquote>

In the introduction to Penguin's 1994 edition of the book, Susan Shillinglaw writes that Steinbeck, after dropping out of Stanford, spent almost two years roaming California, finding work on ranches for [[Spreckels Sugar Company|Spreckels Sugar]] where he would harvest wheat and sugar beets.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Steinbeck|first=John|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/873818443|title=Of mice and men|date=1994|isbn=978-1-101-65980-9|location=New York, N.Y., U.S.A.|oclc=873818443}}</ref> Steinbeck told ''The New York Times'' in 1937:<ref name="nyt-parini" /><blockquote>I was a bindlestiff myself for quite a spell. I worked in the same country that the story is laid in. The characters are composites to a certain extent. Lennie was a real person. He's in an insane asylum in California right now. I worked alongside him for many weeks. He didn't kill a girl. He killed a ranch foreman. Got sore because the boss had fired his pal and stuck a pitchfork right through his stomach. I hate to tell you how many times. I saw him do it. We couldn't stop him until it was too late.</blockquote>

==Reception==
Attaining the greatest positive response of any of his works up to that time, Steinbeck's novella was chosen as a [[Book of the Month Club]] selection before it was published. Praise for the work came from many notable critics, including Maxine Garrard (''Enquirer-Sun''),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.books.google.com/books?isbn=052141038X|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102222444/http://www.books.google.com/books?isbn=052141038X|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 January 2013|title=John Steinbeck – The Contemporary Reviews|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> [[Christopher Morley]], and Harry Thornton Moore (''New Republic'').<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenbooksgroup.co.uk/index.php?target=products&product_id=100627|title=goldenbooksgroup.co.uk|website=www.goldenbooksgroup.co.uk|access-date=10 December 2017}}</ref> ''New York Times'' critic Ralph Thompson described the novella as a "grand little book, for all its ultimate melodrama."<ref name="ContemporaryReviews">{{cite book|last=McElrath|first=Joseph R.|author2=Jesse S.

As a "playable novel", it was performed by the Theater Union of San Francisco as written. This version opened on May 21, 1937 – less than three months after the novel's publication – and ran for about two months.<ref name=":0" />

To create a Broadway production, Steinbeck adapted and slightly revised his original text and this version, produced by [[Sam H. Harris]] and directed by [[George S. Kaufman]], opened on November 23, 1937, in the [[Music Box Theatre]] on Broadway.<ref name="IBDB">{{cite web|title=Internet Broadway Database: Of Mice and Men|publisher=The League of American Theatres and Producers|date=2001–2007|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=12320|access-date=October 8, 2007}}</ref> Running for 207 performances, it starred [[Wallace Ford]] as George and [[Broderick Crawford]] as Lennie.<ref name="IBDB" /> The role of Crooks was performed by [[Leigh Whipper]], the first African-American member of the [[Actors' Equity Association]].<ref name="Whipper">{{cite web|title=Internet Broadway Database: Leigh Whipper|date=2001–2007|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.asp?id=7209|access-date=October 8, 2007}}</ref> (Whipper repeated this role in the 1939 film version.<ref name="Mice1939" />) The production was chosen as Best Play in 1938 by the [[New York Drama Critics' Circle]].<ref name="SteinbeckOrg">{{cite web|title=National Steinbeck Center: About John Steinbeck : Facts, Awards, & Honors|publisher=National Steinbeck Center|url=http://www.steinbeck.org/|access-date=October 8, 2007}}</ref>
