'''Herbert Arthur Wiglev Clamor Grönemeyer''' (born 12 April 1956) is a German singer, musician, producer, composer and actor, popular in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. 

Grönemeyer starred as war correspondent Lieutenant Werner in [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s 1981 film ''[[Das Boot]]'', but later focused on his musical career. His fifth album ''[[4630 Bochum]]'' (1984) and his 11th album ''[[Mensch (album)|Mensch]]'' (2002) are the third and first [[List of best-selling albums in Germany|best-selling records in Germany]] respectively, making Grönemeyer the most successful artist in Germany with combined album sales over 13 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.badische-zeitung.de/rock-pop/groenemeyer-hat-die-meisten--32900357.html|title=Rock & Pop: Grönemeyer hat die meisten - 67 Goldene Schallplatten.|publisher=Badische Zeitung|language=de|access-date=27 November 2016}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Grönemeyer was born on 12 April 1956 in [[Göttingen]], Germany. He often refers to his personal roots as living in [[Bochum]] though, where he spent most of his childhood, youth and early adulthood.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grönemeyer verdrängt Tokio Hotel von Chartspitze|url=http://www.europolitan.de/Looks/Menswear/278,8646,0,0.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802103023/http://www.europolitan.de/Looks/Menswear/278,8646,0,0.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2 August 2012|publisher=Europolitan|access-date=30 November 2011|language=de}}</ref> Grönemeyer's interest in music was sparked at the age of 8, when he started to take piano classes.<ref>{{cite news|title=A Real "Mensch": A Conversation With Germany's Biggest Pop Star, Herbert Grönemeyer|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/a-real-mensch-a-conversat_b_2189783.html|work=Huffington Post|date=26 November 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
{{refimprove|section|date=August 2020}}
Piano classes formed the basis for his work as a pianist and composer at the local theatre Schauspielhaus Bochum. In 1979, at the City of [[Cologne]] Theatre (Schauspielhaus Köln), he performed as Lorenzo in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''. Although never having attended an acting school he soon appeared in several TV productions. During one of the shootings he met his later wife, the actress Anna Henkel. Additionally, Grönemeyer published an album he had recorded with the jazz formation Ocean Orchestra in 1978, a year in which he also composed the music for the film ''Uns reicht das nicht'' by [[Jürgen Flimm]], together with [[:de:Jens-Peter Ostendorf|Jens-Peter Ostendorf]]. His first solo album ''Grönemeyer'', which was published in 1979, was awarded the Golden Lemon for the ugliest album cover of the year. His second album ''Zwo'' was released in 1981. Neither managed to chart. In the same year he starred in [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s successful movie ''[[Das Boot]]'' as Lieutenant Werner. For the role of composer [[Robert Schumann]] in the German-German coproduction [[:de:Frühlingssinfonie (Film)|''Frühlingssinfonie'']] (co-starring [[Nastassja Kinski]] and Rolf Hoppe), for which he also composed the film score, Grönemeyer spent six months in [[East Germany]]. During the early 1980s Grönemeyer put his main focus on his music; the next two albums ''Total egal'' (1982) and ''Gemischte Gefühle'' (1983) flopped and most concerts of the planned tour had to be cancelled.

In 1984, Grönemeyer first met success as a musician with the release of ''[[4630 Bochum]]'' which became the best-selling album in Germany that year, particularly supported by the singles "[[Männer (song)|Männer]]" and "Flugzeuge im Bauch". A year later Grönemeyer appeared in the TV-movie ''Väter und Söhne'', co-starring [[Julie Christie]], [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Bruno Ganz]]. In his next albums ''Sprünge'' (1986) and ''Ö'' (1988), he increasingly expressed his political opinion, criticising the government under German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]]. In 1986, Grönemeyer performed at the [[Anti-WAAhnsinns Festival]] against nuclear power and he composed the film score for the TV film [[:de:Sommer in Lesmona (Fernsehfilm)|Sommer in Lesmona]], for which he received the [[Adolf Grimme Awards|Adolf Grimme Award]] in gold. The release of his first English album ''What's all this'' was followed by a tour through Canada, where it had success in the charts. After the [[Berlin Wall]] had fallen Grönemeyer released the album ''Luxus'' in which he addressed the feelings in East and West Germany.

More than {{formatnum:600000}} people saw the following tour. In 1994, Grönemeyer was the first non-English-speaking artist who was invited by [[MTV]] to do an unplugged concert. Four years later, Grönemeyer moved to London<ref>{{cite news|title=Bono, Joe Cocker and ... Herbert Grönemeyer|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9599987/Bono-Joe-Cocker-and-...-Herbert-Gronemeyer.html|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|author=Neil McCormick|date=15 October 2012}}</ref> and released ''Bleibt alles anders'' (Everything Remains Different). He also founded his own record label, [[Grönland Records]]. In the same year, his brother Wilhelm and his wife Anna died of cancer (both dying within four days of each other); it took Grönemeyer a year to resume his work. In 2000, he recorded a concert with a philharmonic orchestra and released the DVD ''Stand der Dinge'' (State of Affairs).

In August 2002, he released his album ''[[Mensch (album)|Mensch]]'' (Human) which was awarded Platinum even before release due to advance orders. The single "Mensch" became Grönemeyer's first number one hit in Germany and 1.5 million people saw the 2-year tour. In 2004 and 2006 Grönemeyer recorded songs for the [[Olympic Games]] in Athens ("Everlasting") and the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany ("[[Celebrate the Day]]"), respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/divo-perform-official-song-time-our-lives-19951|title=Il Divo to perform Official Song "Time of Our Lives"|publisher=fifa.com|date=14 February 2006}}</ref>

In March 2007, he released his 12th studio album ''[[12 (Herbert Grönemeyer album)|12]]'' which was followed by a stadium tour across German-speaking countries. Smaller concerts took place in September in Amsterdam, Munich, [[Dresden]], and London's [[Royal Albert Hall]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}

The three re-recorded albums ''What's all this'', ''Luxus'' and ''Chaos'' for the English-speaking market were met with limited sales success. Grönemeyer was scheduled to make his American debut on 17 September 2007 at the Beacon Theater in New York City, but the performance was cancelled.

In January 2010, Grönemeyer performed the anthem "Komm zur Ruhr" as part of the opening ceremony of the "[[RUHR.2010]]" – The city of Essen being the "[[European Capital of Culture]] 2010" on behalf of the entire [[Ruhr]] area.

In March 2011, Grönemeyer released his next studio album ''[[Schiffsverkehr]]'', which became a number-one-album in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Herbert+Gr%25F6nemeyer&titel=Schiffsverkehr&cat=a|title=Das österreichische Hitparaden- und Musik-Portal|first=Steffen|last=Hung|website=austriancharts.at|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref> The following 2011 tour of the same name had an audience of 550,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.excite.de/herbert-groenemeyer-auf-schiffsverkehr-tour-2012-N53282.html|title=Herbert Grönemeyer auf Schiffsverkehr Tour 2012|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref>

''[[I Walk]]'', the English-language debut in the U.S. for Grönemeyer, was released in February 2013 on Grönland Deutschland/EMI Label Services. In early 2013, he played his first American concerts at the [[Chicago Theatre]] on 23 February and New York's [[Irving Plaza]] on 26 February.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Billboard spotlight on Herbert Gronemeyer|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/1549925/spotlight-on-herbert-gronemeyer|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> His U.S. website later announced 12 tour dates in the U.S. and Canada for September 2013. The album, which includes guest performances from [[Bono]] of [[U2]], [[Antony Hegarty]] of [[Antony and The Johnsons]], and guitarist [[James Dean Bradfield]] of the [[Manic Street Preachers]], was released in the UK in October 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bono, Joe Cocker and ...

The magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' awarded him the title of "European Hero" in 2005 for his humanitarian work.<ref>{{Cite news|last=BATES|first=THEUNIS|date=2005-10-02|title=Rocking the System|language=en-US|work=Time|url=http://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,1112760,00.html|access-date=2021-11-19|issn=0040-781X}}</ref>

Grönemeyer's 2014 album ''[[Dauernd jetzt]]'' won the [[Goldene Kamera]] award for the best German language album of 2014 and 2015, while Grönemeyer himself received the Best National Music award.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenekamera.de/bildergalerie-50-verleihung-2015/preistraeger-groenemeyer/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150301194648/http://www.goldenekamera.de/bildergalerie-50-verleihung-2015/preistraeger-groenemeyer/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=1 March 2015 |title=Herbert Grönemeyer |language=de |work=[[Goldene Kamera]] |access-date=1 March 2015 }}</ref> In March 2015, Grönemeyer also won an [[Echo (music award)|Echo award]] with this album.<ref name="Echo 2015">{{cite web |title='Die Helene-Fischer-Festspiele haben begonnen' |trans-title=The Helene Fischer festival has begun |language=de |publisher=[[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg]] |work=RBB online |first=Ula |last=Brunner |date=27 March 2015 |access-date=27 March 2015 |url=http://www.rbb-online.de/kultur/beitrag/2015/03/musikpreis-echo-2015.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150330121504/http://www.rbb-online.de/kultur/beitrag/2015/03/musikpreis-echo-2015.html |archive-date=30 March 2015 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
