'''A Lot Like Birds''' was an American [[post-hardcore]] band formed in [[Sacramento]], [[California]]. The band released four albums and received considerable media attention from music sites.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Since the release of 2011's ''Conversation Piece'', A Lot Like Birds signed to [[Equal Vision Records]] and released their third studio album on October 29, 2013. The band announced their final show on their Facebook page on February 17, 2018.

== History ==
===Formation and ''Plan B'' (2009&ndash;2010)===
The band formed in Sacramento when guitarist/vocalist Michael Franzino invited local musicians to collaborate on an album. The result was A Lot Like Birds's debut album ''Plan B''.<ref name="Official MySpace">{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/alotlikebirds|title=A Lot Like Birds &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace.com|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Released in 2009, the album was largely instrumental and experimental, featuring horns, strings, and guest vocals in addition to screamed vocals and post-hardcore arrangements. It has been widely distributed for free online by the band.

Following the album's release, A Lot Like Birds formed a core around five of the musicians involved: Franzino and Ben Wiacek (Vegan Discharge) on guitar, Michael Littlefield on bass, Joe Arrington on drums, and Cory Lockwood (Vegan Discharge) on vocals. The other musicians that appeared on the album would appear at live shows as guest performers, and the band took to describing themselves as a "5-8 piece" outfit.<ref name="Official MySpace" />

===Addition of Kurt Travis and ''Conversation Piece'' (2011)===
In January 2011, A Lot Like Birds confirmed that singer [[Kurt Travis]] would be joining the band,<ref name="Sputnik">{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/news/16608/Kurt-Travis-joins-A-Lot-Like-Birds/|title=Kurt Travis joins A Lot Like Birds|website=Sputnikmusic.com|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> after the information had already leaked online.<ref name="Leak">{{Cite web|url=https://chorus.fm/|title=chorus.fm|website=Chorus.fm|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Travis, who had previously fronted [[Dance Gavin Dance]], had originally planned to collaborate with A Lot Like Birds for a track, but decided to join after seeing how well he and the band fit together.<ref name="test">{{Cite web|url=http://mindequalsblown.net/interviews/allb|title=Interview: A Lot Like Birds|website=Mindequalsblown.net|date=February 10, 2011|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>

Travis soon formed a connection at Doghouse Records, and in April A Lot Like Birds announced that they had signed to the label, despite not having any music to showcase beyond ''Plan B''. The first demo recorded with Kurt Travis was for the song "Tantrum (Far from the Tree, the Apple Grew Rotten)", an eight-minute, uncommonly structured song that leaked onto the internet in March, before the signing was announced.<ref name="NALLB">{{Cite web|url=http://mindequalsblown.net/editorials/not-a-lot-like-before-the-story-of-kurt-travis-and-a-lot-like-birds|title=Not A Lot Like Before: The Story of Kurt Travis and A Lot Like Birds|website=Mindequalsblown.net|date=February 23, 2012|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>

Having generated a steady buzz, A Lot Like Birds released their second album, ''Conversation Piece'', to much anticipation on October 11. With more focus on vocals than on their first album, ''Conversation Piece'' was also less experimental and more focused on post-hardcore elements. The release was generally well received by fans of the genre. With their second album under their belt, the band set out on their first national tour with Just Like Vinyl and [[Dance Gavin Dance]].

===Signing to Equal Vision and ''No Place'' (2012–2014)===
On August 8, 2012, it was announced that A Lot Like Birds had signed to [[Equal Vision Records]]. On September 12, 2013, Equal Vision Records and A Lot Like Birds announced that a new album, [[No Place (album)|''No Place'']], would be released on October 29. A new song entitled "Kuroi Ledge" was released on October 4. A music video for the song "Next to Ungodliness" was released on October 25.

''[[No Place (album)|No Place]]'' debuted at number 199 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and number 6 on the Heatseekers Album Chart. The album focuses on the idea of "home" and continues the theme of the group's lyrical focus and use of spoken word in their music. The songs of ''No Place'' shine a spotlight on what constitutes a home and the emotional attachments or lack thereof within various rooms of a house.

An animated music video for the song "Connector" was released on January 9, 2014.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMSexZunQRM | title=A Lot Like Birds "Connector" Official Music Video | publisher=[[YouTube]] | date=9 January 2014 | accessdate=9 March 2014}}</ref>

===''DIVISI'', side projects and Kurt Travis' departure (2015–2017)===
The band announced on February 28, 2015 that bassist Michael Littlefield had left the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ALotLikeBirds/photos/a.441668808790/10151254873343791/?type=3|title=A Lot Like Birds|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On June 26, 2015, the band announced Matt Coate as their new bassist while on tour, and guitarist Michael Franzino released a debut full-length studio album for his side project, alone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wearealone.bandcamp.com/album/somewhere-in-the-sierras|title=Somewhere in the Sierras, by alone.|website=Wearealone.bandcamp.com|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> On February 20, 2016 the band announced [[Kurt Travis]]' departure from the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ALotLikeBirds/videos/10153614727738791/?permPage=1|title=A Lot Like Birds LP IV|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref> Travis cited a change in the band's direction as his reason for leaving. In Travis's absence, Cory Lockwood took vocal lessons to expand his vocal abilities for the new album, with additional vocals performed by Matt Coate. On March 8, 2017, the band released a teaser video for the album, titled ''DIVISI''. The album was released on May 5, 2017.

===Break up (2018)===
The band announced on their Facebook page that they will be breaking up following almost ten years together.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ALotLikeBirds/videos/10155703775473791/|title=It’s February 17th, 2018 and this is the end of A Lot Like Birds.|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=2020-03-30}}</ref>
