'''Omar Christopher Lye-Fook''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 14 October 1968 in [[London]]),<ref name="Cordor"/> known professionally as '''Omar''', is a British [[soul music|soul]] singer, songwriter and musician. Omar grew up in [[Canterbury]], [[Kent]]. He learned his craft classically, playing the trumpet, piano and percussion. He also spent two years at [[Chetham's School of Music]] in [[Manchester]] and the [[Guildhall School of Music]] in London. His most well-known song was his debut single "[[There's Nothing Like This (song)|There's Nothing Like This]]".<ref name="Cordor">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p30830|pure_url=yes}}|title=Biography: Omar|last=Cordor|first=Cyril|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=10 June 2010}}</ref> It reached number 14 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on re-release in 1991.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Career==
Following his first two [[Single (music)|single]] releases, "Mr Postman" (1985) and "You and Me" (1988) featuring backing vocals from [[Caron Wheeler]], Omar released his debut [[album]], ''[[There's Nothing Like This]]'' in 1990. Initially released on his father's [[record label]], Kongo Records, it entered the [[UK Albums Chart]], peaking at #54.<ref name="Cordor"/><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Signing to his first major record label, [[Talkin' Loud]], saw the re-release of his debut album, which climbed to #19 in the UK Albums Chart. This was followed in 1992 by his second album, ''Music'', which proved less successful than the first, peaking at #37.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

A new signing to [[RCA Records]] led to Omar undertaking collaborations with other musicians, including [[Lamont Dozier]], [[David Frank (music)|David Frank]] ([[The System (band)|The System]]), the former [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]] [[bassist]] Derrick Bramble, [[Leon Ware]] and [[Stevie Wonder]].<ref name="Cordor"/> In 1996, Omar contributed "[[Water to Drink]]" to the [[AIDS]] [[benefit album]], ''[[Red Hot + Rio]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

In 2003, after one of his songs ("[[There's Nothing Like This (song)|There's Nothing Like This]]") was used in the intro round on ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'', presenter [[Mark Lamarr]] questioned Omar's supposed instant recognisability, quipping that he would require a [[Blockbuster (movie rental store)|Blockbuster]] card to confirm Omar's identity. Omar's agent, e-mailed the show and a few episodes later, Omar appeared in the show's 'identity parade' round, Blockbuster card in hand. Lamarr was forced to concede that Omar was both immediately recognisable, and a rather more significant artist than he had earlier given him credit for.<ref>{{cite episode

During July and August 2015, Omar appeared as part of the house band in the [[BBC Two]] comedy series ''[[The Javone Prince Show]]''.
