'''Danity Kane''' is an American [[girl group]] whose current members are [[Aubrey O'Day]], [[Dawn Richard]] and [[Shannon Bex]]. The group originally had five members, but [[D. Woods|Wanita "D. Woods" Woodgett]] left the group in 2008 and [[Aundrea Fimbres]] left in 2014. Formed on the third iteration of [[MTV]]'s ''[[Making the Band]]'' reality television series in 2005, they signed to [[Bad Boy Records]] by [[Sean Combs|Diddy]].

Danity Kane's [[Danity Kane (album)|self-titled debut studio album]] was released in 2006 and achieved success in the United States, shipping a million copies domestically,<ref name="RIAA1">{{cite web|title=RIAA Certifications|work=Billboard|url=https://billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/index.jsp|access-date=June 23, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618131213/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/index.jsp|archive-date=June 18, 2007}}</ref> while spawning two singles with top 10 single "[[Show Stopper]]" and the ballad "[[Ride for You]]".

=== 2004–2005: ''Making the Band 3'' ===
{{details|topic=the show|Making the Band 3}}
In 2004, producer [[Sean Combs]] returned with ''Making the Band 3'', the third iteration of the ''[[Making the Band]]'' television series, in search of the next female supergroup.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> With the help of choreographer [[Laurie Ann Gibson]], vocal trainer Doc Holiday and talent manager [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]], he set out on a multi-city search and invited 20 young singers out of almost 10,000 young women to live and compete for positions in the group in New York City.<ref name=MtV.CoM /><ref name="blender.com">{{cite news|title=Aubrey O'Day MTV's Making the Band hottie gears up for more catfights and dance-offs. |publisher=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]] |date=September 2005 |access-date=October 16, 2008 |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1726 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921234203/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1726 |archive-date=September 21, 2008 }}</ref> When seven women remained, Combs became discontent with the level of talent remaining in the competition and decided not to form a band.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> He did, however, feel three contestants deserved another chance, including then-best friends [[Aubrey O'Day]] and [[Aundrea Fimbres]], whose close bond originally formed early in the season.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> The three contestants became the first to appear in season 2 of the show.<ref name=MtV.CoM />

At the start of the second season, Combs once again pressed his team to audition new young women for the group.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> Finally, 20 young women were chosen and moved into a loft in New York City.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> Viewers had become invested in O'Day and Fimbres's friendship, naming them "the AUs" and "Aubrea" ([[portmanteau|portmanteux]] of their first names put together), as they watched the two compete all over again for positions in the group.<ref name=MtV.CoM /><ref name="www.aubreyoday.com">{{cite web|title=Aubrey O'Day|publisher=aubreyoday.com|url=http://www.aubreyoday.com/ }}</ref> As the competition's challenges increased, their friendship seemed to become the foundation upon which the group was being built.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> In addition, O'Day emerged as the show's breakout star.<ref name=MtV.CoM /><ref name=blender.com />

After weeks of dance and singing lessons, promotional appearances, and a performance in front of 10,000 at a [[Backstreet Boys]] concert at [[Nissan Pavilion]] in Bristow, VA, 11 contestants remained, including O'Day and Fimbres.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> The finalists were sent home for three months, told to polish up, and return for the final stretch in November 2005.<ref name=MtV.CoM />

On the second season's finale, on Tuesday, November 15, 2005, the show's ratings broke MTV records as millions of viewers watched to see the group officially formed.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> Five of the 11 remaining contestants were chosen: O'Day first, [[D. Woods|Wanita "D. Woods" Woodgett]] second, [[Shannon Bex]] third, [[Dawn Richard (singer)|Dawn Richard]] fourth, and Fimbres last.<ref name=MtV.CoM />

The third season of ''Making the Band 3'' tracked the development and struggles of the new band — from then on known as "Danity Kane" (a name taken from a female [[anime]] superhero created and drawn by Richard).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnextinc.com/bbo/news/introdanitykane.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017004031/http://www.gnextinc.com/bbo/news/introdanitykane.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=October 17, 2006 |title=Bad Boy's Diddy introduces Danity Kane |publisher=Gnextinc.com |access-date=May 16, 2011 }}</ref> The group would later be featured on the second and third seasons of ''[[Making The Band 4#Making the Band 4: Day26 and Donnie Klang|Making the Band 4]]'' with new male [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group [[Day26]], as well as new solo artist [[Donnie Klang]].

After months of recording, the band's [[Danity Kane (album)|self-titled debut album]] was released to mixed reviews on August 22, 2006, in the [[United States]]. Produced by [[Timbaland]], [[Scott Storch]], [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Mario Winans]] and [[Ryan Leslie]] among others, the album sold over 90,000 copies in the first day of release, and over 234,000 in the first week of release.<ref name="VH1-1">{{cite web|title=Outkast Take A Billboard Beating From Diddy's Danity Kane|work=VH1 News|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1539767/20060830/kane__danity.jhtml|access-date=August 19, 2007}}</ref> It debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. ''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, knocking veteran [[Christina Aguilera]]'s ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]'' from the top spot and out-selling hip-hop duo [[OutKast]].<ref name="VH1-1" /> The album received a [[platinum album|platinum certification]] from the [[RIAA]] in November 2006.<ref name="BB-1">{{cite web|title=RIAA Certifications|work=Billboard|url=https://billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/index.jsp|access-date=August 19, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618131213/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/riaa/index.jsp|archive-date=June 18, 2007}}</ref>
The album's lead single "[[Show Stopper]]", produced by Jim Jonsin, was serviced to radio on August 4, 2006, and subsequently debuted at number 17 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]; it however peaked at number 8 on that particular chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=danity kane|chart=all}} Billboard.com – Artist Chart History – Danity Kane<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}</ref> Outside the United States, the song became a top-30 success in [[Germany]] and [[Lithuania]]. The selection for the album's second single, the [[Bryan Michael Cox]]-produced "[[Ride for You]]", was influenced by a fan poll that was distributed through e-mails, [[MySpace]], and the group's official web site. The music video for the song premiered on [[MTV]]'s ''[[Total Request Live]]'' on December 5, 2006, the same day the band released a holiday song called "Home for Christmas", which was written by Richard.<ref name="RU-1">{{cite news|title=D.

From February to May 2007, Danity Kane performed as an opening act, along with [[The Pussycat Dolls]], on Christina Aguilera's [[Back To Basics Tour]]. In the meantime, the band intensified work on their second album, which was initially scheduled for a late 2007 release but was eventually pushed back to 2008.<ref name="Billbiard">{{cite web | title=Danity Kane Keeping The 'Show' Going On New CD| work=billboard| url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053248/danity-kane-keeping-the-show-going-on-new-cd| access-date=April 2, 2007}}</ref>

Ever since the creation of the group, Danity Kane was plagued by rumors of the group's demise,<ref name=MtV.CoM /> largely due to the group's reality television origins, their management, record label, and mentor.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> In the summer of 2007, during a hiatus between their first and second albums, speculation concerning the possibility of a disbandment by fans and the media circulated the internet and entertainment news outlets. The rumors were fueled by quotes taken out of context (most notably when Aubrey O'Day was questioned by [[TMZ.com|TMZ]]<ref name="Ishmil">{{cite web | title=Aubrey ditch's Danity for Dolls?| work=TMZ| url=https://www.tmz.com/2007/07/11/is-aubrey-ditching-danity-for-the-dolls| access-date=July 13, 2007}}</ref> about her relationship to the successful pop girl group the [[Pussycat Dolls]] and their television show ''[[Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/?p=3057 |title=Aubrey O'Day to Join The Pussycat Dolls? |publisher=Rap-up.com |access-date=May 16, 2011}}</ref>) and by work the group members had done outside of Danity Kane since the release of their debut album. [[D. Woods]]'s association with another girl group, The Girl's Club, was specifically cited as adding credibility to breakup rumors.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> Additionally, reports of solo careers and of new groups forming from various combinations of members of the group were rampant.<ref name=MtV.CoM />
Over the course of these rumors, the members of Danity Kane often published personal online responses to the breakup speculation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://aubreyoday.us/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1184312211&archive=&start_from=&ucat=7,12& |title=Celebrating our one year online |publisher=AubreyOday.us |access-date=May 16, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012154630/http://aubreyoday.us/index.php?subaction=showcomments&id=1184312211&archive=&start_from=&ucat=7%2C12& |archive-date=October 12, 2007 }}</ref> It was not until July 25, 2007, that Danity Kane released an official statement on their group MySpace page stating that they were still together and working on their second album.

=== 2007–2008: ''Welcome to the Dollhouse'' and departures of O'Day and Woods ===
{{details|topic=the album|Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)}}
While making several solo appearances on other artists' albums during fall 2007, Danity Kane was featured on the second season of the fourth iteration of ''Making the Band'' which debuted January 28, 2008, on [[MTV]], where solo singer [[Donnie Klang]], [[Day26]], and the girls, lived and recorded their albums together.
"[[Damaged (Danity Kane song)|Damaged]]", the band's poll-voted lead single from their second album ''[[Welcome to the Dollhouse (album)|Welcome to the Dollhouse]]'', was officially released as a digital single on January 29, 2008, and became the band's second top ten hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Its music video was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] for "Best Pop Video" and "Best Dancing in a Video" but lost to "[[Piece of Me (Britney Spears song)|Piece of Me]]" by [[Britney Spears]] and "[[When I Grow Up (Pussycat Dolls song)|When I Grow Up]]" by [[the Pussycat Dolls]] respectively. ''Welcome to the Dollhouse'', was eventually released on March 18, 2008, in the United States, where it debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with first week sales of 236,000 copies (2,000 units more than their [[Danity Kane (album)|self-titled debut album]]).<ref name="eleven">{{cite news|author=Katy Hasty|title=Danity Kane Snags Second Straight No. 1 Album|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046065/danity-kane-snags-second-straight-no-1-album|publisher=Billboard|date=March 26, 2008|access-date=March 26, 2008}}</ref> The album eventually received a [[gold album|gold certification]] from the [[RIAA]] in April 2008.

On the second-season finale of ''Making the Band 4'', it was announced that Danity Kane would be headlining a tour in 2008 and be featured on the next season of ''Making the Band'', as Diddy stated himself. The third season of ''Making the Band 4'' premiered on MTV August 19, 2008. Around a week later, the girls were featured in an interview with [[WHTZ|Z100]] at the Beatstock Dance Festival, where they stated they were planning to release another single after "Bad Girl".<ref name="twenyseven">{{cite news|author=YouTube|title=Danity Kane Exclusive Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IX0s3RDpzoI}}</ref>

After ''[[Making the Band 4 – The Tour]]'' and the release of the first single "Damaged", Danity Kane once again encountered rumors of a breakup, largely spurred by scenes from the ''Making the Band'' series featuring their mentor [[Sean Combs]] sparring with O'Day over her dance performance and desire to create her own image separate from the group.<ref name="www.mtv.com">{{cite web | title=MTV's Making the Band| work=MTV| url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/making_the_band_4/episode/episode.jhtml?episodeId=141813}}</ref> On the August 28, 2008, episode of ''Making the Band'', Combs, frustrated with the "oversexed" image he felt O'Day now showcased, he called O'Day "one of the worst dancers" in Danity Kane, when she used to be "one of the best".<ref name="MTV.COm">''[[Making the Band]]'', ''[[MTV]]'' (August 28, 2008).

On September 7, 2008, however, the group appeared together at the [[MTV Video Music Awards]] to help present the Best New Artist Award.<ref>{{cite web | title=MTV Viewers Have Spoken With Three Moonmen| work=Market Watch| url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/mtv-viewers-have-spoken-britney/story.aspx?guid=%7B7C3F4201-D048-4B9D-94CB-18EDD3264146%7D&dist=hppr}}</ref>

Speculation of a break-up were also developing because of rumors that Richard would perhaps be groomed to launch her own solo career with [[Bad Boy Records]].<ref name="MTV.cOm">''[[Making the Band]]'', ''[[MTV]]'' (October 7, 2008).

In Season 3, Episode 8 of ''Making the Band'', Combs stated that he did have Richard on three demos for his new album. On the same episode of the show, which was filmed on September 12, 2008, after continued debate with O'Day about the well-being of Danity Kane, he stated that O'Day was no longer in the group, as had been foreshadowed in an earlier episode within the season after a [[Total Request Live|TRL]] (Total Request Live) appearance. Combs was unaware of the specific problems within the group, but sensed that O'Day and [[Aundrea Fimbres]], who were originally close friends, had drastically drifted apart.<ref name="MTV.cOm" /> O'Day and Richard informed Combs that the entire group had trust issues with management and ultimately each other.

[[MTV]] News reached out to a rep for Danity Kane to see where the future of the band stood now that [O'Day and Woods] were no longer in the group.<ref name=www.mTv.com /> It was reported that Woods planned to work with another group, the Girls Club,<ref name=www.mTv.com /> and that O'Day was working on a solo album.

In an October 15, 2008, interview with ''[[Us Weekly]]'', Richard gave further insight into O'Day's dismissal from Danity Kane. "[Combs] did not like [O'Day's] image...where her image was going for the group", she said. "It wasn't a personal thing."<ref name="usmagazine.com">{{cite web|title=Why Aubrey O'Day Was Kicked Out of Danity Kane|publisher=[[Us Weekly]]|date=October 15, 2008|access-date=October 16, 2008|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/news/why-aubrey-o-day-was-kicked-out-of-danity-kane|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016143610/http://www.usmagazine.com/news/why-aubrey-o-day-was-kicked-out-of-danity-kane|archive-date=October 16, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Richard explained that O'Day's increasingly "sexy look" was alienating young fans. Referring specifically to O'Day's topless pictures for ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' magazine just a month before, Richard stated, "We had just did a signing with Dollhouse Teen, which is for 13, 14-year-old young girls... So we can't do that one day and then the next day do an obnoxious cover.... [Combs] wants the fans, and he says he can't do that if we can continue to go in the direction that we were going."<ref name=usmagazine.com /> Richard further relayed, "[Combs] told me specifically that [O'Day] is no longer in Danity Kane and Danity Kane will move forward without her."<ref name=usmagazine.com /> When asked if Combs would seek "replacements" for O'Day and Woods, Richard stated, "He has not said anything per that. But I think in my heart that he is gonna do another show."<ref name=usmagazine.com />
MTV News gauged fan reactions to the dismissals of O'Day and Woods. Fans left impassioned, long and detailed comments on the MTV News site about their discontent regarding the decision to remove the two singers, and relayed that the remaining members were using the breakup to "score" publicity.<ref name="MTV.COM">{{cite news| first= Jocelyn|last=Vena|title=Danity Kane Fans React To Aubrey O'Day, D.

=== 2008–2009: Disbandment ===
In mid-2008, before the departure of O'Day and Woods, Danity Kane planned to start pre-production for their third studio album, which would have begun January 2009.<ref name="dawnrichard.org">{{cite web|url=http://dawnrichard.org/displayimage.php?album=334&pos=0 |access-date=February 18, 2016|title=No title |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212091709/http://dawnrichard.org/displayimage.php?album=334&pos=0 |archive-date=February 12, 2009 }}</ref> In the meantime, Danity Kane released a line of denim jeans through Dollhouse. Under [[Russell Simmons]] Plastic Cash International, the decision was made to feature Danity Kane's image on [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] [[debit cards]]. The group had also been a part of a new [[ad campaign]] for [[PETA]] (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). Collectively, as a group, there were plans for a fragrance, clothing and makeup line.<ref name="dawnrichard.org" /> Richard had developed a comic book based on the superhero the group based its name on, which was intended for release sometime in 2009.<ref>{{cite news | title=Danity Kane's MTV fame reels in marketers| work=Reuters| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0935132820080910| access-date=September 13, 2008 | date=September 10, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Danity Kane Launches Comic Book|work=Rap-Up|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2008/09/05/danity-kane-launches-comic-book/|access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref>

However, in a January 28, 2009, interview with MTV News, Richard announced that the group had split up.<ref name=MTV.CoM /> Richard explained that Combs had invited all the women to come back to the 2009 season of ''Making the Band'' and that only two of them, Richard and Fimbres, showed up. "It changes [our situation] completely", she said.<ref name=MTV.CoM /> "We have fans out there who love Danity Kane. We love Danity Kane. It's hard. We're sitting here trying to make sense of it now. It's hard.

I don't want to even try to answer it 'cause that's not fair to her. I haven't [spoken to her] but I heard she's doing well with her husband and she got a house. I love her, but I don't know."<ref name=MTV.CoM /> Richard was surprised that only two members showed up for another season. "The thing about it ... I thought we were all going to come back and talk, or maybe if [O'Day] didn't come back, 'cause I don't know how [Combs] was feeling about that, if the four of us got together. I didn't know what to expect. I just know I got off the plane and found out I was the only one there and [Fimbres] came the next day."<ref name=MTV.CoM />

Still in disbelief over the departures of O'Day and Woods, as well as [[Aubrey O'Day#Personal life|the speculation about O'Day's sexuality]] and her forthcoming ''[[Playboy]]'' spread, Richard stated, "I'm still surprised at it all. I'm still trying to recover from the first fire. So I'm still confused. I still don't know. I'm just being so honest. I have no idea."<ref name=MTV.CoM />

On February 25, 2009, O'Day told MTV News that she was not sure if Woods had been asked back for the new season of ''Making the Band'', as far as she knew, but that she herself was not asked to return. "Well, I was fired and we all saw that", she said.<ref name="mTV.CoM">{{cite news|first= Jocelyn|last=Vena|title=Aubrey O'Day 'Would Never Say No' To Danity Kane Reunion.

O'Day conveyed her hope that fans continue to honor the group that "made her a star".<ref name=mTV.CoM /> "Danity Kane was a wonderful group, and like all things, nothing is forever", she said.<ref name=mTV.CoM /> "We had a great run and we were very successful. We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people."<ref name=mTV.CoM /> O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in me coming back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that", she said.<ref name=mTV.CoM /> "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment", said O'Day.<ref name=mTV.CoM /> "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to know how I feel, they can go there."<ref name=mTV.CoM /> O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation.

Viewers were able to see the band's continued demise on the third season of ''Making the Band 4'', which premiered on February 12, 2009.<ref name=MTV.CoM /> During the February 26, 2009, episode, as well as the continued season, viewers saw Richard and Fimbres eager to continue being a group together and hoping to work with Bex again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/making-the-band-4-season-3-ep-12-how-you-gonna-fix-it |access-date=February 28, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> This eagerness eventually ended in the April 16, 2009, airing. Within the first five minutes of the episode, Combs told Richard and Fimbres during a meeting that he released O'Day and Woods, along with Bex, from their contracts, and would be releasing Fimbres as well. He told Richard that she will remain on the label and that if there are any future plans for a new Danity Kane, she would be the only returning member.<ref name="MTV.cOM">''[[Making the Band]]'', ''[[MTV]]'' (April 16, 2009).

On April 23, 2009, viewers were expecting to see all five members of Danity Kane for the second part of the finale to find out if Danity Kane would without a doubt be removed from the Bad Boy label or if they would have a "fresh start" as Combs stated in the first part of the finale.<ref name="MTV.cOM" /> During the finale, Fimbres did not show up.<ref name="MTV.coM">''[[Making the Band]]'', ''[[MTV]]'' (April 23, 2009). Retrieved on April 23, 2009.</ref> Bex explained that Fimbres did not show up because Fimbres "had been through enough" emotional turmoil with the group and wanted to stay home with family.<ref name=MTV.coM /> As for herself not showing up for the 2009 season of ''Making the Band'', Bex said that it was a "personal choice" and was nothing against the fans.<ref name=MTV.coM /> Woods said that part of the reason for the group's demise was due to not having a "sound foundation" when it began (five strangers being put together and expected to be emotionally close) and that eventually led to professional and personal problems with the group.<ref name=MTV.coM /> O'Day said she has forgiven being released from the group, and people who blamed her for the group's breakup.<ref name=MTV.coM /> When asked if Danity Kane could be a group again, O'Day said yes.<ref name=MTV.coM /> Woods and Bex said not at this time.<ref name=MTV.coM /> Combs said that they need a "time out" for now, particularly to work on their solo or alternative careers, and that he will not reunite Danity Kane unless the group consists of all five original members.<ref name=MTV.coM />

On April 30, 2009, a special titled "The Rise and Fall of Danity Kane" aired on MTV. The special was an in-depth story showcasing how the group came together and broke apart.<ref name=MtV.CoM /> It reasoned that the breakup of friendships and new friendships built in place of old friendships (O'Day and Fimbres becoming distant; O'Day bonding more with Woods and Fimbres bonding more with Bex), as well as insecurity issues of each member, were contributing factors for the group's demise. In addition, everyone except for Bex was speculated as having been part of the blame.<ref name=MtV.CoM />

=== 2013–2014: Reunion, ''DK3'', and second disbandment ===

In May 2013, O'Day, Bex, Richard and Fimbres began talks about a possible reunion and have since then posted photos of the group in the recording studio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1561447/danity-kane-reunion-rumors-swirl-following-recent-meeting |title=Danity Kane Reunion Rumors Swirl Following Recent Meeting |publisher=Billboard |date=May 13, 2013 |access-date=June 5, 2014}}</ref> An announcement with regard to their reunion was made at the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards|2013 Video Music Awards]] on MTV.<ref name="dkreunion" /> During the 2013 MTV VMAs pre-show, the four remaining members of Danity Kane announced that they were reuniting, returning on their own terms without Diddy. They announced that a single would be released soon titled "Rage", produced by The Stereotypes, the same producers who were responsible for Danity Kane's biggest single to date, "Damaged". Original group member D. Woods did not take part in the reunion.

In 2020, Danity Kane released an EP entitled ''Strawberry Milk'' containing two singles: "Fly" and "Boy Down". Although the track was released under Danity Kane, the EP is also promoted as Aubrey X Dawn. On Instagram Live, O'Day addressed Bex's absence from the group. She stated "Shan is building a company right now called Vooks." O'Day said, "Danity Kane is so much bigger than five girls. It can be one girl, it can be two, it can be five.
