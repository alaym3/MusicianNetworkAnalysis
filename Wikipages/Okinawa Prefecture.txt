Okinawa Prefecture's largest island, [[Okinawa Island]], is the home to a majority of Okinawa's population. Okinawa Prefecture's [[indigenous people|indigenous ethnic group]] are the [[Ryukyuan people]], who also live in the [[Amami Islands]] of Kagoshima Prefecture.

Okinawa Prefecture was ruled by the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] from 1429 and unofficially [[annexed]] by Japan after the [[Invasion of Ryukyu]] in 1609. Okinawa Prefecture was officially founded in 1879 by the [[Empire of Japan]] after seven years as the [[Ryukyu Domain]], the last domain of the [[Han system]]. Okinawa Prefecture was occupied by the [[United States of America]] during the [[Allied occupation of Japan]] after [[World War II]], and governed by the [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands|Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands]] from 1945 to 1950 and [[United States Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands|Civil Administration of the Ryukyu Islands]] from 1950 until the prefecture was returned to Japan in 1972.

Also during this period, many [[Gusuku]]s, similar to castles, were constructed. The Ryukyu Kingdom entered into the [[Imperial Chinese tributary system]] under the [[Ming dynasty]] beginning in the 15th century, which established economic relations between the two nations.

In 1609, the [[Shimazu clan]], which controlled the region that is now [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], [[Invasion of Ryukyu|invaded the Ryukyu Kingdom]]. The Ryukyu Kingdom was obliged to agree to form a suzerain-vassal relationship with the [[Satsuma Domain|Satsuma]] and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], while maintaining its previous role within the Chinese tributary system; Ryukyuan sovereignty was maintained since complete annexation would have created a conflict with China. The Satsuma clan earned considerable profits from trade with China during a period in which foreign trade was heavily restricted by the shogunate.

[[File:Ryukyuan mission in Edo.jpg|thumb|A Ryukyuan [[Ryukyuan missions to Edo|embassy]] in [[Edo]].]]

Although Satsuma maintained strong influence over the islands, the Ryukyu Kingdom maintained a considerable degree of domestic political freedom for over two hundred years. Four years after the 1868 [[Meiji Restoration]], the Japanese government, through military incursions, officially annexed the kingdom and renamed it Ryukyu [[Han (administrative division)|han]]. At the time, the Qing Empire asserted a nominal suzerainty over the islands of the Ryukyu Kingdom, since the Ryūkyū Kingdom was also a member state of the Chinese tributary system. Ryukyu han became Okinawa Prefecture of Japan in 1879, even though all other hans had become prefectures of Japan in 1872. In 1912, Okinawans first obtained the right to vote for representatives to the {{Nihongo|[[National Diet]]|国会}} which had been established in 1890.<ref>Steve Rabson, "Meiji Assimilation Policy in Okinawa: Promotion, Resistance, and "Reconstruction" in ''New Directions in the Study of Meiji Japan'' ([[Helen Hardacre]], ed.).

===1945–1965===
Near the end of World War II, in 1945, the [[US Army]] and [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] invaded Okinawa with 185,000 troops. A third of Okinawa's civilian population died;<ref name="economist">{{cite news | url=http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5097132 | work=[[The Economist]] | title=No home where the dugong roam | date=October 27, 2005 | quote=some of the bloodiest campaigns anywhere in the second world war were fought in Okinawa, and a third of the civilian population died. | access-date=September 7, 2006 | archive-date=September 5, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905210944/http://www.economist.com/displaystory.cfm?story_id=5097132 | url-status=live }}</ref> a quarter of the civilian population died during the 1945 [[Battle of Okinawa]] alone.<ref name=Guardian110307/> The dead, of all nationalities, are commemorated at the [[Cornerstone of Peace]].

After the end of World War II, the United States set up the United States [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands|Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands]] administration, which ruled Okinawa for 27 years. During this "trusteeship rule", the United States established numerous military bases on the Ryukyu islands. The [[Ryukyu independence movement]] was an Okinawan movement that clamored against U.S. rule.

====Continued U.S. military buildup====
During the [[Korean War]], [[B-29 Superfortress]]es flew bombing missions over [[Korea]] from [[Kadena Air Base]] on Okinawa. The military buildup on the island during the [[Cold War]] increased a division between local inhabitants and the American military. Under the 1952 [[Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security between the United States and Japan]], United States [[United States Forces Japan|Forces Japan]] (USFJ) have maintained a large military presence.
 
During the mid-1950s, the U.S. seized land from Okinawans to build new bases or expand currently-existing ones. According to the Melvin Price Report, by 1955, the military had displaced 250,000 residents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ryukyu-okinawa.net/pages/archive/price.html|title=The Melvin Price Report|last=Special Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee, House of Representatives|date=1955|website=via Ryukyu-Okinawa History and Culture Website|access-date=23 May 2019|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806025243/http://ryukyu-okinawa.net/pages/archive/price.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Secret U.S. deployment of nuclear weapons====

===1965–1972 (Vietnam War)===
Between 1965 and 1972, Okinawa was a key staging point for United States in its military operations directed towards [[North Vietnam]]. Along with [[Guam]], it presented a geographically strategic launch pad for covert bombing missions over [[Cambodia]] and [[Laos]].<ref>John Morrocco. Rain of Fire. (United States: Boston Publishing Company), pg 14</ref> Anti-Vietnam War sentiment became linked politically to the movement for reversion of Okinawa to Japan.
In 1965, the US military bases, earlier viewed as paternal post war protection, were increasingly seen as aggressive. The Vietnam War highlighted the differences between United States and Okinawa, but showed a commonality between the islands and mainland Japan.<ref name="NYT65">{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Trumbull|newspaper=The New York Times|title=OKINAWA B-52'S ANGER JAPANESE: Bombing of Vietnam From Island Stirs Public Outcry.|date=1 August 1965|url=http://0-www.proquest.com.mercury.concordia.ca/|access-date=27 September 2009|archive-date=December 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209143838/http://0-www.proquest.com.mercury.concordia.ca/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As controversy grew regarding the alleged placement of [[nuclear weapons]] on Okinawa, fears intensified over the escalation of the [[Vietnam War]]. Okinawa was then perceived, by some inside Japan, as a potential target for China, should the communist government feel threatened by United States.<ref>Mori, Kyozo, Two Ends of a Telescope Japanese and American Views of Okinawa, Japan Quarterly, 15:1 (1968:Jan./Mar.) p.17</ref> American military secrecy blocked any local reporting on what was actually occurring at bases such as [[Kadena Air Base]]. As information leaked out, and images of air strikes were published, the local population began to fear the potential for retaliation.<ref name=NYT65 />

Political leaders such as Oda Makoto, a major figure in the [[Beheiren]] movement (Foundation of Citizens for Peace in Vietnam), believed, that the return of Okinawa to Japan would lead to the removal of U.S. forces ending Japan's involvement in Vietnam.<ref name="Havens, T. R. H. 1987 Pg 120">Havens, T. R. H. (1987) Fire Across the Sea: The Vietnam War and Japan, 1965–1975. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press.

R. H. 1987 Pg 120"/> The Beheiren became a more visible anti-war movement on Okinawa as the American involvement in Vietnam intensified.

In 1969, chemical weapons leaked from the US storage depot at Chibana in central Okinawa, under [[Operation Red Hat]]. Evacuations of residents took place over a wide area for two months.

In a 1981 interview with the ''[[Mainichi Shimbun]]'', [[Edwin O. Reischauer]], former U.S. ambassador to Japan, said that U.S. naval ships armed with nuclear weapons stopped at Japanese ports on a routine duty, and this was approved by the Japanese government.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

The [[1995 Okinawa rape incident|1995 rape]] of a 12-year-old girl by U.S. servicemen triggered large protests in Okinawa. Reports by the local media of accidents and crimes committed by U.S. servicemen have reduced the local population's support for the U.S. military bases. A strong emotional response has emerged from certain incidents. As a result, the media has drawn renewed interest in the [[Ryukyu independence movement]].

===Natural parks===
As of 31 March 2019, 36 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[Prefectural Natural Park|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Iriomote-Ishigaki National Park|Iriomote-Ishigaki]], [[Kerama Shotō National Park|Kerama Shotō]], and [[Yanbaru National Park|Yanbaru]] National Parks; [[Okinawa Kaigan Quasi-National Park|Okinawa Kaigan]] and [[Okinawa Senseki Quasi-National Park|Okinawa Senseki]] Quasi-National Parks; and [[Irabu Prefectural Natural Park|Irabu]], [[Kumejima Prefectural Natural Park|Kumejima]], [[Tarama Prefectural Natural Park|Tarama]], and [[Tonaki Prefectural Natural Park|Tonaki]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data/natural/naturalpark_4.pdf |script-title=ja:自然公園都道府県別面積総括 |trans-title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |language=ja |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |access-date=13 June 2019 |archive-date=August 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806004612/https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data/natural/naturalpark_4.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Geology===
The island is largely composed of [[coral]], and rainwater filtering through that coral has given the island many caves, which played an important role in the [[Battle of Okinawa]].

===Climate===
The island experiences temperatures above {{convert|20|C}} for most of the year. The climate of the islands ranges from [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'') in the north, such as [[Okinawa Island]], to [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Köppen climate classification ''Af'') in the south such as [[Iriomote Island]]. The islands of Okinawa are surrounded by some of the most abundant coral reefs found in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Establishing World-Class Coral Reef Ecosystem Monitoring in Okinawa |url=https://www.oist.jp/news-center/press-releases/establishing-world-class-coral-reef-ecosystem-monitoring-okinawa |publisher=Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology Graduate University |access-date=2016-02-20 |date=2013-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302155239/https://www.oist.jp/news-center/press-releases/establishing-world-class-coral-reef-ecosystem-monitoring-okinawa |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Coral Reefs |url=http://en.okinawastory.jp/learn/blue_ocean/coral/ |publisher=Okinawa Convention & Visitors Bureau |access-date=2016-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302135347/http://en.okinawastory.jp/learn/blue_ocean/coral/ |archive-date=March 2, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The world's largest colony of rare blue coral is found off of Ishigaki Island.<ref>{{cite iucn |author=Obura, D. |author2=Fenner, D. |author3=Hoeksema, B. |author4=Devantier, L. |author5=Sheppard, C. |date=2008 |title=''Heliopora coerulea'' |volume=2008 |page=e.T133193A3624060 |doi=10.2305/IUCN.UK.2008.RLTS.T133193A3624060.en |access-date=11 November 2021}}{{Dead link|date=August 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Snowfall is unheard of at sea level.

==Demography==

=== Ethnic groups ===
The indigenous [[Ryukyuan people]] make up the majority of Okinawa Prefecture's population, and are also the main ethnic group of the [[Amami Islands]] to the north. Large Okinawan diaspora communities persist in places such as [[South America]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Aug 2015|first=Mina Otsuka / 18|title=Immigration—Missing Link in Japanese History: Why Are There So Many Okinawan Immigrants? – Part 1|url=http://www.discovernikkei.org/en/journal/2015/8/18/okinawan-1/|access-date=2020-10-12|website=Discover Nikkei|language=en}}</ref> and [[Hawaii]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Center for Okinawan Studies|url=https://manoa.hawaii.edu/okinawa/wordpress/?page_id=78|access-date=2020-10-12}}</ref> With the introduction of American military bases, there are an increasing number of half-[[Americans|American]] children in Okinawa, including prefecture governor [[Denny Tamaki]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Rich|first=Motoko|date=2018-09-25|title=A Marine's Son Takes On U.S. Military Bases in Okinawa|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/world/asia/okinawa-governor-election.html|access-date=2020-09-28|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=December 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207122625/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/world/asia/okinawa-governor-election.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The prefecture also has a sizable minority of [[Yamato people]] from mainland Japan; exact population numbers are difficult to establish, as the [[Japanese government]] does not officially recognise Ryukyuans as a distinct ethnic group from Yamatos.

The overall ethnic identity of Okinawa residents is rather split. According to a telephone poll conducted by Lim John Chuan-tiong, an associate professor with the [[University of the Ryukyus]], 40.6% of respondents identified as “{{Nihongo2|沖縄人}} (Okinawan)”, 21.3% identified as “{{Nihongo2|日本人}} (Japanese)” and 36.5% identified as both.

Having been a separate nation until 1879, Okinawan language and culture differ in many ways from those of mainland Japan.

===Language===
{{main|Ryukyuan languages}}

There remain six [[Ryukyuan languages]] which, although related, are incomprehensible to speakers of [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. [[Amami Ōshima language|One of the Ryukyuan languages]] is spoken in [[Kagoshima Prefecture]], rather than in Okinawa Prefecture. These languages are in decline as the younger generation of Okinawans uses Standard Japanese. Mainland Japanese - and some Okinawans themselves - generally perceive the Ryukyuan languages as "dialects". Standard Japanese is almost always used in formal situations. In informal situations, ''de facto'' everyday language among Okinawans under age 60 is Okinawa-accented mainland Japanese ("[[Okinawan Japanese]]"), which is often mistaken by non-Okinawans as the Okinawan language proper. The actual traditional Okinawan language is still used in traditional cultural activities, such as [[Okinawan music|folk music]] and [[Kumi Odori|folk dance]]. There is a radio-news program in the language as well.<ref>
[http://www.okinawabbtv.com/news/h_news.htm おきなわBBtv★沖縄の方言ニュース★沖縄の「今」を沖縄の「言葉」で！ラジオ沖縄で好評放送中の「方言ニュース」をブロードバンドでお届けします。] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140102192753/http://www.okinawabbtv.com/news/h_news.htm |date= January 2, 2014 }}. Okinawabbtv.com. Retrieved on 2013-08-16.
</ref>

===Religion===
{{main|Ryukyuan religion}}
Okinawans have traditionally followed Ryukyuan religious beliefs, generally characterized by [[ancestor worship]] and the respecting of relationships between the living, the dead, and the gods and spirits of the natural world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/15945|title=陶磁器から古の神事（祭祀・儀式）を考える|last=Okinawa Prefectural reserve cultural assets center|date=2006|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|access-date=2016-09-02|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728031104/https://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/en/15945|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cultural influences===
Okinawan culture bears traces of its various trading partners. One can find [[Chinese Culture|Chinese]], [[Culture of Thailand|Thai]] and [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] influences in the island's customs. Perhaps Okinawa's most famous cultural export is [[karate]], probably a product of the close ties with and influence of China on Okinawan culture. Karate is thought to be a synthesis of Chinese [[kung fu]] with traditional Okinawan martial arts.

A traditional Okinawan product that owes its existence to Okinawa's trading history is [[awamori]]—an Okinawan distilled spirit made from ''indica'' rice imported from [[Thailand]].

===Other cultural characteristics===
<!-----no article on Kinjo, nn. no citations despite months of waiting--
The people of Okinawa maintain a strong tradition of [[pottery]], textiles, and glass making. Potter [[Jiro Kinjo]] was designated a Living National Treasure for traditional Okinawan pottery in 1985,<ref>[http://www.e-yakimono.net/html/living-natl-treasures.htm]</ref> making him the first Okinawan person to receive this designation in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} He died in December 2004, aged 92 and his original works of pottery are prized by collectors.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Other prominent examples of Okinawan culture include the [[sanshin]]—a three-stringed Okinawan instrument, closely related to the Chinese [[sanxian]], and ancestor of the Japanese [[shamisen]], somewhat similar to a [[banjo]]. Its body is often bound with snakeskin (from [[Pythonidae|pythons]], imported from elsewhere in Asia, rather than from Okinawa's venomous [[Trimeresurus flavoviridis]], which are too small for this purpose). Okinawan culture also features the [[Eisa (dance)|eisa dance]], a traditional drumming dance. A traditional craft, the fabric named [[bingata]], is made in workshops on the main island and elsewhere.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Trimillos|first=Ricardo D.|date=2009|title=Review of Drumming Out a Message: Eisa and the Okinawan Diaspora|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25652439|journal=Asian Music|volume=40|issue=2|pages=161–165|doi=10.1353/amu.0.0035|jstor=25652439|s2cid=191601292|issn=0044-9202}}</ref>

The [[Okinawa diet|Okinawan diet]] consists of low-fat, low-salt foods, such as whole fruits and vegetables, legumes, tofu, and seaweed. Okinawans are particularly well known for consuming purple potatoes, also known as Okinawan sweet potatoes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.downtoearth.org/health/nutrition/okinawan-sweet-potato-purple-powerhouse-nutrition|title=The Okinawan Sweet Potato: A Purple Powerhouse of Nutrition|last=Earth|first=Down to|date=2011-11-11|website=Down to Earth Organic and Natural|language=en|access-date=2019-10-07|archive-date=August 6, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806033443/https://www.downtoearth.org/health/nutrition/okinawan-sweet-potato-purple-powerhouse-nutrition|url-status=live}}</ref> Okinawans are known for their [[longevity]]. This particular island is a so-called [[Blue Zone]], an area where the people live longer than most others elsewhere in the world. Five times as many Okinawans live to be 100 as in the rest of Japan, and Japanese are already the longest-lived ethnic group globally.<ref>''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' magazine, June 1993</ref> {{as of|2002}} there were 34.7 centenarians for every 100,000 inhabitants, which is the highest ratio worldwide.<ref name="Santrock">{{cite book|author=Santrock, John W.

A cultural feature of the Okinawans is the forming of [[Moai (social support groups)|''moais'']]. A {{Nihongo3|||moai}} is a community social gathering and groups that come together to provide financial and emotional support through emotional bonding, advice giving, and social funding. This provides a sense of security for the community members and as mentioned in the Blue Zone studies, may be a contributing factor to the longevity of its people.<ref>{{cite web|title=Okinawa's Longevity Lessons|url=https://www.bluezones.com/2014/03/okinawas-longevity-lessons/|website=Blue Zones|publisher=Admin|access-date=29 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151001104107/https://www.bluezones.com/2014/03/okinawas-longevity-lessons/|archive-date=October 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In recent years,{{when|date=August 2014}} Okinawan literature has been appreciated outside of the Ryukyu [[archipelago]]. Two Okinawan writers have received the [[Akutagawa Prize]]: [[Matayoshi Eiki]] in 1995 for {{Nihongo|''The Pig's Retribution''|豚の報い|Buta no mukui}} and [[Medoruma Shun]] in 1997 for ''A Drop of Water'' (''Suiteki''). The prize was also won by Okinawans in 1967 by [[Tatsuhiro Oshiro]] for ''Cocktail Party'' ({{Nihongo3|||Kakuteru Pāti}}) and in 1971 by [[Mineo Higashi]] for ''Okinawan Boy'' ({{Nihongo3|||Okinawa no Shōnen}}).<ref name="O-times">{{cite news|url=http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/summit/english/2000/20000721_6.html |title=Okinawa Writers Excel in Literature|date=July 21, 2000|work=The Okinawa Times|publisher=Okinawa Times|access-date=September 3, 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20000823030320/http://www.okinawatimes.co.jp/summit/english/2000/20000721_6.html |archive-date = August 23, 2000}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bunshun.co.jp/award/akutagawa/list1.htm|script-title=ja:芥川賞受賞者一覧|year=2009|publisher=Bungeishunju Ltd.|language=ja|access-date=September 3, 2009|title=Archived copy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213000347/http://www.bunshun.co.jp/award/akutagawa/list1.htm|archive-date=February 13, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Karate===
{{main|Karate}}

[[Karate]] originated in Okinawa. Over time, it developed into several styles and sub-styles. On Okinawa, the three main styles are considered to be [[Shōrin-ryū]], [[Gōjū-ryū]] and [[Uechi-ryū]]. Internationally, the various styles and sub-styles include [[Matsubayashi-ryū]], [[Wadō-ryū]], [[Isshin-ryū]], [[Shōrinkan]], [[Shotokan]], [[Shitō-ryū]], [[Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan Karate|Shōrinjiryū Kenkōkan]], [[Shorinjiryu Koshinkai Karatedo|Shorinjiryu Koshinkai]], and [[Shōrinji-ryū]].

===Architecture===

[[File:Naha Shuri Castle20s5s3200.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shuri Castle]] in Naha]]

Despite widespread destruction during World War II, there are many remains of a unique type of castle or fortress known as ''[[gusuku]]''; the most [[Values (heritage)|significant]] are now inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List ([[Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/972/ |title=Gusuku Sites and Related Properties of the Kingdom of Ryukyu |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |access-date=May 29, 2012 |archive-date=May 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513102456/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/972 |url-status=live }}</ref> In addition, [[List of Important Cultural Properties of Japan (Okinawa: structures)|twenty-three Ryukyuan architectural complexes]] and [[List of Historic Sites of Japan (Okinawa)|forty historic sites]] have been [[Cultural Properties of Japan|designated for protection]] by the national government.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index_pc.asp |title=Database of National Cultural Properties: 国宝・重要文化財 (建造物): 沖縄県 |language=ja |publisher=[[Agency for Cultural Affairs]] |access-date=13 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190722215103/https://kunishitei.bunka.go.jp/bsys/index_pc.asp |archive-date=July 22, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Shuri Castle]] in [[Naha]] is an [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].

Whereas most [[Housing in Japan|homes in Japan]] are made from wood and allow free-flow of air to combat humidity, typical modern homes in Okinawa are made from concrete with barred windows to protect from flying plant debris and to withstand regular [[typhoon]]s. Roofs are designed with strong winds in mind, in which each tile is cemented on and not merely layered as seen with many homes in Japan.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The Nakamura House ([[:ja:中村家住宅 (沖縄県)]]) is an original 18th century farmhouse in Kitanakagusuki.

Many roofs also display a lion-dog statue, called a ''[[shisa]]'', which is said to protect the home from danger. Roofs are typically red in color and are inspired by Chinese design.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The Chinese and Japanese Influence In Ryukyuan Architecture - Okinawa Prefecture|url=https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/the-chinese-and-japanese-influence-in-ryukyuan-architecture/ZwLild7YMwcxIg|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Google Arts & Culture|language=en}}</ref>

==Education==
