'''Slothrust''' ''(pronounced sloth-rust, IPA: ''['slɔθ.rʌst]'') <ref>{{Cite web|title=SLOTHRUST - "Crockpot" (Live at JITV HQ in Los Angeles, CA)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZL8spWct9sA|access-date=2019-04-05|website=youtube.com|quote=Hello, we are called Sloth Rust.}}</ref>'' is an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]].

== Background ==
Slothrust consists of Leah Wellbaum ([[Vocals (phonetics)|vocals]], [[guitar]]), Kyle Bann ([[Bass guitar|bass]]), and Will Gorin ([[drum]]s). Wellbaum and Gorin first began collaborating as students at [[Sarah Lawrence College]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://indegoot.com/slothrust.php|title=In De Goot|website=indegoot.com|access-date=2017-09-15}}</ref> After performing in various school groups, the two joined to create music with a "heavier" sound. In search for a bassist, Bann later joined the band.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wesleyanargus.com/2014/09/04/slothrust-interview/|title=Slothrust Descends on Eclectic|work=The Wesleyan Argus|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}</ref>

The name Slothrust came together as a combination of Wellbaum's former project "Slothbox" and "rust" to signify time passing.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://wesleyanargus.com/2014/09/04/slothrust-interview/|title=Slothrust Descends on Eclectic|work=The Wesleyan Argus|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en}}</ref>

=== 2012&ndash;2013: ''Feels Your Pain'' ===
The band released their debut album ''Feels Your Pain'', featuring their lead single "7:30 AM". The track was later featured as the opening theme song for [[FX (TV channel)|FX]]'s television series ''[[You're the Worst]]''.

In November, Slothrust collaborated with Wreckroom Records to record a cover of [[The Turtles]]' "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]".<ref>{{Citation|last=Wreckroom|title=SLOTHRUST - Happy Together|date=2012-11-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDlklKl1fr8|accessdate=2017-09-19}}</ref>

=== 2014&ndash;2015: ''Of Course You Do'' ===
On February 18, 2014, Slothrust released their sophomore album ''Of Course You Do'' through [[Ba Da Bing Records|Ba Da Bing! Records]].

=== 2016&ndash;2017: ''Everyone Else'' ===
On July 7, 2016, it was announced that Slothrust were signing to [[Dangerbird Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dangerbirdrecords.com/news/slothrust-sign-to-dangerbird-records-announce-fall-tour-with-highly-suspect/|title=Dangerbird Records Slothrust Sign to Dangerbird Records & Announce Fall Tour with Highly Suspect|last=Dangerbird|website=dangerbirdrecords.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref>

The band premiered several tracks that lead to the release of their third full-length album, ''Everyone Else''. The first single, "Horseshoe Crab", premiered via [[Noisey]] on August 10, 2016, was explained as "a dark narrative about love, loss, growing up, depression, and existential anxiety".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/3bd3mw/quench-your-thirst-for-new-slothrust-with-new-video-horseshoe-crab|title=Quench Your Thirst for More Slothrust with Their New Video for "Horseshoe Crab"|website=Noisey|language=en-us|access-date=2017-09-18}}</ref> Slothrust later shared "Like A Child Hiding Behind Your Tombstone", and "Horseshoe Crab".

''Everyone Else'' debuted on October 28, 2016. The record was described as less angry and closely relating to dreams and the water, "''Of Course You Do'', as well as the one before that, ''Feels Your Pain'', are a bit angrier. When you write songs earlier in your life—depending on where you’re at—the likelihood of them being angsty is higher," Wellbaum explained to [[Out (magazine)|Out Magazine]], "This record I don’t think is angry in the same way. It asks more questions...[''Everyone Else]'' has space for interpretation and for questions. And the new record deals very specifically with water and dreams in a way that the first two did not."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.out.com/music/2017/1/06/slothrusts-leah-wellbaum-talks-moving-past-angst-coming-terms-identity-exclusive|title=Slothrust's Leah Wellbaum Talks Moving Past the Angst, Announces Tour Dates (Exclusive)|date=2017-01-06|access-date=2017-09-18|language=en}}</ref>
