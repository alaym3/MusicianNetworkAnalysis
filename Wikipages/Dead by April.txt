'''Dead by April''' is a Swedish [[metalcore]] band from [[Gothenburg]], formed in February 2007 by Pontus Hjelm and [[Jimmie Strimell]]. The current band lineup consists of  Pontus Hjelm (guitars/keyboards/programming/clean vocals), Christopher Kristensen (unclean vocals), Marcus Wesslén (bass/backing growled vocals) and Marcus Rosell (drums). Despite many line up changes throughout their career, both Marcus Wesslén and Pontus Hjelm have remained consistent since their debut album.

== History ==
=== Early career and the self-titled album (2007–2010) ===
The band was formed in early 2007, when Jimmie Strimell, the lead vocalist of [[Nightrage]], decided to collaborate with songwriter and former [[Cipher System]] member Pontus Hjelm to form Dead by April. During the band's early days in 2007 and 2008, the band did not release any physical media, though most of the songs that they gave to friends were quickly leaked out to several [[peer-to-peer]]-sites, with the first songs being "Lost" and "Stronger".<ref name="roadrunnerrecords.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=129462 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909164802/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=129462 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 September 2012 |title=DEAD BY APRIL: Berlin Interview, Pro-Shot Performance Footage Available |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=28 January 2012 }}</ref> During this time, they also played in local venues around [[Gothenburg]].

On 27 March 2010, Dead by April headlined the Norwegian festival 'Rock mot Rus' together with several Norwegian acts such as [[Turdus Musicus]], Moddi, Cyaneed, Jodski, [[Purified in Blood]] etc.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockmotrus.no/headliners/ |title=Rock Mot Rus |publisher=Rockmotrus.no |access-date=28 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001174040/http://rockmotrus.no/headliners/ |archive-date=1 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band continued touring with Purified in Blood until early May.<ref name="femalefirst.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/rockmusic/Dead+By+April+Love+Like+Blood+Purified+In+Blood+UK+Tour-11853.html |title=Dead By April Love Like Blood, Purified in Blood UK Tour |publisher=Female First |date=7 May 2010 |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref>

On 23 April 2010, it was announced on the band's official [[MySpace]] page that Pontus Hjelm had officially left Dead by April, to focus on songwriting. He stayed on as the main songwriter, telling the fans that "nothing is different in the songwriting department". The replacement for Hjelm became Zandro Santiago who only provided vocals as the band felt that it did not change much of the sound to continue with only one guitarist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=154434313&blogId=533256861 |title=Pontus leaves Dead by April - MySpace-blog &#124; van Dead By April |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=23 April 2010 |access-date=28 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=7 February 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 17 May 2010, the band released the fourth single of their debut album. Unlike any other Dead by April-single release, this single was a double A-Side entitled "Love Like Blood/Promise Me". Besides that, "[[Love Like Blood (song)|Love Like Blood]]" is a [[Killing Joke]] cover; it marks the very first track recorded by Dead by April with their new singer, Zandro Santiago. "Promise Me", however, already appeared on the album.<ref name="femalefirst.co.uk"/>

On 22 October 2010, it was announced that Olsson would be leaving the band, citing "personal issues", as well as focusing on his clothing range.<ref>[http://www.myspace.com/dbaswe/blog/540092224 Johan, Guitars decides to leave Dead By April] My Space</ref> The band searched for a new guitarist via [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://de-de.facebook.com/deadbyapril/posts/165515336814914 |title=Hey everybody !! we... &#124; Facebook |publisher=De-de.facebook.com |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref> However, they later revealed on their Facebook page that Pontus would act as a "session" player on their upcoming album and whilst on tour.

During Dead by April's UK tour with [[My Passion]], Olsson was replaced by guitarist Joel Nilsson.

In August 2010, they released a teaser for a new song called "Within My Heart", which was released, along with the new album, in early 2011. The album is heavier and more dynamic than their self-titled album.<ref name="Dead By April: Nouvel album pour 2011!">{{cite web|url=http://www.spirit-of-metal.com/read_news-id-24628-l-cn.html|publisher=Spirit of Metal|title=Dead By April: Nouvel album pour 2011!|author=Eniotna|language=fr|date=1 October 2010|access-date=5 December 2010}}</ref> The song "More Than Yesterday" has been played live on tour in the UK and Sweden and will feature on the new album, as well as the [[Compilation album|compilation]] album, "[[Stronger (Dead by April album)|Stronger]]". Strimell released a demo recording of it on his [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfr-eLK4QUc Me in tha studio] YouTube</ref>

Dead by April made an appearance on the soundtrack for ''[[Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010 video game)|Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit]]'' as a featured artist on the song "Stronger" by [[Lazee]] (not to be confused with their song with the same name).

On 7 December, it was announced that a new [[Compilation album|compilation]] album called ''[[Stronger (Dead by April album)|Stronger]]'' would be released on 25 January 2011. It contains a demo version of "More Than Yesterday", three heavier versions of their songs and some tracks that have already been released.

During shows in Russia, [[DeathDestruction]] drummer Jonas Ekdahl, was replacing Svenningson while he is resting his ears. Ekdahl will remain as a session drummer for the coming 3 to 5 months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=183144421698174&id=712837212 |title=Facebook |publisher=Facebook |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/marcus.jehrlander/posts/466260936785 |title=marcus.jehrlander/posts |publisher=Facebook.com |access-date=28 January 2012}}</ref>

=== ''Incomparable'' (2010–2012) ===
On 19 April 2011, Dead by April confirmed the mixing was complete for their newest album via their Facebook page. On 2 May 2011, Dead by April announced that their first single of their second album would be "Within My Heart". This was released digitally on 16 May 2011 and included two more songs - a new song called "Two Faced" and a re-recorded version of "Unhateable". Later, it was confirmed that the band would perform at the [[Sonisphere Festival]] in Sweden on 9 July.

Dead by April began mixing their new album in the second quarter of 2011 and concluded on 19 April 2011. On 4 July, the band announced the title of the new album to be ''[[Incomparable (Dead by April album)|Incomparable]]'', and it was announced on 11 July that it would be released on 21 September,<ref name= "DEAD BY APRIL på Debaser och Sticky Fingers i september!">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocknytt.se/konsert/1733-dead-by-april-pa-debaser-och-sticky-fingers-i-september|publisher=Rock Nytt|title=DEAD BY APRIL på Debaser och Sticky Fingers i september!|first=Ron|last=Dahlgren|language=sv|date=6 July 2011|access-date=6 August 2011}}</ref> though it was rumored to be delayed in early August to a possible 7 November release date.<ref name= "NEWS: Dead By April reveal new album details and November UK tour!">{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/6765/news-dead-by-april-reveal-new-album-details-and-november-uk-tour/|publisher=Dead Press|title=NEWS: Dead By April reveal new album details and November UK tour!|author=Dead Press Staff|date=8 August 2011|access-date=8 August 2011}}</ref><ref name="SWEDISH CHART-TOPPERS DEAD BY APRIL RE-SCHEDULE THE DATES">{{cite web|url=http://www.planetmosh.com/swedish-chart-toppers-dead-by-april-re-schedule-the-dates/|publisher=Planet Mosh|first=David|last=Farrell|title=SWEDISH CHART-TOPPERS "DEAD BY APRIL" RE-SCHEDULE THE DATES|date=27 September 2011|access-date=30 September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502122646/http://planetmosh.com/swedish-chart-toppers-dead-by-april-re-schedule-the-dates/|archive-date=2 May 2012}}</ref> The album cover was originally going to be released by the band on Facebook once they reached 230,000 "likes", but other sites leaked the cover so the band released it early.<ref name= "New Artwork Added Of Upcoming Albums With Chickenfoot, Dead By April, Etc.">{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=news&id=18511&section=comments|publisher=Melodic|first=Kaj|last=Roth|title=New Artwork Added of Upcoming Albums With Chickenfoot, Dead By April, Etc.|date=12 August 2011|access-date=12 August 2011}}</ref> The cover features a sky blue background with the same "Dead by April" logo as their self-titled album.

The album is said to be heavier and more dynamic than their self-titled album.<ref name="Dead By April: Nouvel album pour 2011!"/> Zandro Santiago commented on the band's genre, stating that, "[Dead by April is a] metal and boyband pop. Metal fans might not handle it properly."<ref name= "LIVE: Se Dead By April här!">{{cite web|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/musik/rockbjornen2011/article13305284.ab|publisher=Live Rock Björnen|title=LIVE: Se Dead By April här!|first=Martin|last=Gustafsson|language=sv|date=11 July 2011|access-date=6 August 2011}}</ref>

Similarly to the band's debut album, ''Incomparable'' debuted at number two on the national Swedish album charts, the band's homeland. The album was outsold only by [[Melissa Horn]]'s ''Innan jag kände dig'', which was in its second week of release and had already reached gold status in Sweden.<ref name= "Dead By April - Incomparable (Album)">{{cite web|url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Dead+By+April&titel=Incomparable&cat=a|publisher=Hung Medien|work=Swedish Charts|title=Dead By April - Incomparable (Album)|access-date=6 October 2011}}</ref>

Dead by April performed in [[Melodifestivalen]] in early 2012 and went into the finals. The band placed 7th, using the song "Mystery". They have also announced that they are currently working on a new album, and that Pontus Hjelm had rejoined officially.

The band re-recorded an old demo song of theirs called "Found Myself in You" for pledgers on their PledgeMusic site. They have also announced that they will release a compilation album early next year.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} On 25 February 2013, Dead by April gained the number of pledges required for them to fund a live DVD release set for 13 March. Unfortunately, after much delay due to subsequent filming problems, the band later scrapped the release and refunded the funds.<ref name="DVD in the making">http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/deadbyapril/updates/17216, From their official PledgeMusic account.</ref>

On 18 March 2013, it was confirmed by the band that Strimell was no longer part of the band and had been replaced by Christoffer Andersson, current member of What Tomorrow Brings. The statement also stated that a new album, EP and tour was under way.

=== ''Let the World Know'' (2012–2015) ===
It was announced in November 2013 that the band's new album, ''[[Let the World Know]]'', was scheduled for release in mid-February 2014, and would be published by [[Spinefarm Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dead-by-april-to-release-let-the-world-know-in-february/ |title=Dead By April To Release 'Let The World Know' In February |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=1 November 2013 |access-date=22 November 2013}}</ref> Later that month, the band later confirmed the official release date of the album will be on 12 February 2014.

On 1 September 2017, the band released an EP ''Worlds Collide (Jimmie Strimell Sessions)'' which features Strimell on unclean vocals. On 15 September 2017, the band released a cover of the [[Linkin Park]] song "[[Numb (Linkin Park song)|Numb]]" as a tribute to the late [[Chester Bennington]], this is the first newly recorded material released since Strimell rejoined the band. On 20 October 2017, they released an acoustic EP ''Worlds Collide (Acoustic Sessions)''.

On 13 January 2019, Dead by April launched the April Army Platform, a subscription service that allows access to exclusive content such as the band's video diary, free band merch and remastered songs recorded with their current vocalist line-up.

=== New Songs (2019-present)===

On 6 March 2020, Hjelm released a statement via the band's Facebook and website citing that Jimmie Strimell had been dismissed from the band for a second time; due to his continued drug and alcohol abuse, in spite of his own vows to stay sober. Shortly afterwards, Hjelm released a statement announcing dEMOTIONAL's lead growler Christopher Kristensen would replace Strimell on their current tour, explaining his position within the band as 'a trial run'. Since then, the band has produced five new original songs with Kristensen on scream vocals; "Memory",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/us/album/memory-single/1503499200|title=Memory - Single by Dead By April|website=[[Apple Music]]|access-date=20 April 2020}}</ref> "Bulletproof" (both released in 2020), "Heartbeat Failing", "Collapsing" and "Anything At All" in 2021. They also recorded a cover of "Let It Go" from the 2013 film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]''.
