Their third album ''Midnight Memories'' (2013) is a pop rock record, a slight departure from the band's original teen pop sound. Liam Payne called Midnight Memories a "slightly rockier and edgier" album than their previous material. The album is heavily influenced by 80's rock<ref>{{Cite web|last=Spang|first=Rachel|title=One Direction Embraces New Sound with "Midnight Memories"|url=https://walpolestudentmedianetwork.com/51482/entertainment/one-direction-embraces-new-sound-with-midnight-memories/|access-date=11 August 2020|website=The Rebellion}}</ref> and folk music and briefly integrates elements of dubstep, notably in "Little White Lies". The album's lyrical themes primarily revolve around love, heartbreak and sexual intercourse. Many critics praised its lyrical depth and musical composition, as well as the group's level of involvement in the production process.<ref name="Hollywood Reporter">{{cite news| url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/one-directions-midnight-memories-what-660135 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Kyle | last=Jaeger | title=One Direction's 'Midnight Memories': What the Critics Are Saying | date=26 November 2013}}</ref>

Their fourth album ''Four'' (2014) was released on 17 November 2014. Payne once again claimed that the album would be "edgier" and that the group had written most of the songs for it; Horan came up with the name of the album, commemorating the fact that it is One Direction's fourth record to date and that it has been four years since the band's formation. Signifying a further maturation of their pop sound, the album's first single, "[[Steal My Girl]]", was dubbed by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' as "no [[What Makes You Beautiful]], but its [[Coldplay]]-like piano pop could be a good direction",<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/review/album-review/6319861/one-direction-four-album-review |title=Album Review: One Direction's 'Four' | work=Billboard | first=Chuck | last=Arnold | date=17 November 2014}}</ref> and that the band was "not entirely ready to let go of its bubble-gum days". ''Rolling Stone'' described the record as "saturated with retro vibes"; its songs "split the difference between big, splashy Eighties [[pop rock]] and more elegant Seventies flavours – a very pesky whipper-snapper move that's not so far from what [[Haim (band)|Haim]]'s hit "[[Days Are Gone]]" did last year".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/one-direction-four-20141118 |title=One Direction extend their winning streak, with echoes of the 1970s and 1980s | work=Rolling Stone | first=Jon | last=Dolan | date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

Horan commented on One Direction as a boy band, "People think that a boy band is air-grabs and [being] dressed in all one colour. We're boys in a band. We're trying to do something different from what people would think is the typical kind of boy band. We're trying to do different kinds of music and we're just trying to be ourselves, not squeaky clean."<ref name="nationalpost1">{{cite news | first = Leah | last = Collins | url = http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/12/one-direction-is-more-than-just-another-boy-band/ | archive-url = https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20120313001910/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2012/03/12/one-direction-is-more-than-just-another-boy-band/ | url-status=dead | archive-date = 13 March 2012 | title = One Direction: X Factor boy band on what sets them apart | work = National Post | location = Canada | publisher = [[Postmedia Network]] | date = 12 March 2012 | access-date = 17 March 2012 }}</ref> Leah Collins, writing for the ''[[National Post]]'', remarked they had succeeded on the latter front.

Caroline Watson, the band's original stylist, spoke about styling the band, "At the beginning I didn't want them all in black or all in leather&nbsp;– that whole stereotypical boy band thing." Instead, her original idea was for them to be the "male equivalent to the [[Spice Girls]]", with each member being a part of the group but still having his own individual style.<ref name=styling>{{cite news| first =Brodie | last = Lancaster |url = http://themuse.jezebel.com/behind-the-boy-band-q-a-with-caroline-watson-one-dire-1687594935 | title = Behind the Boy Band: Q&A with Caroline Watson, One Direction's Stylist | work = Jezebel | date = 2 March 2015 | access-date= 9 March 2017}}</ref>
