Then over the years, we've just been waiting for Mike, and he's been doing other stuff so it took a while. I think the [[COVID-19 pandemic|pandemic]] kind of helped spur it along because he was stuck at home, so he wrote the vocal melodies and the rest of the lyrics at his studio in San Francisco."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.mxdwn.com/2021/03/05/features/mxdwn-interview-mr-bungle-and-tomahawk-bassist-trevor-dunn-on-tonic-immobility-re-recording-first-demo-future-fantomas-plans/|title = MXDWN Interview: Mr. Bungle and Tomahawk Bassist Trevor Dunn on Tonic Immobility, Re-Recording First Demo & Future Fantomas Plans -|date = March 5, 2021}}</ref>
