== History ==

=== 1978: Formation and band name ===
In 1978 Zé Pedro and Zé Leonel decided to start a punk rock band, with Zé Pedro on the guitar and Zé Leonel on vocals. Together with Paulo Borges they started with the name Delirium Tremens. They auditioned Kalú for the drums part and decided to change their name to Xutos & Pontapés. Shortly after, Paulo Borges was replaced on the bass by Tim. The band had their first rehearsal in December 1978.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Biografia {{!}} XutosPontapés {{!}}|url=https://xutos.pt/biografia/|access-date=2021-01-17|website=Xutos&Pontapés|language=pt-PT}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2017-11-17|title=Xutos & Pontapés: a história bonita de uma vida malvada {{!}} Altamont|url=https://altamont.pt/xutos-pontapes-a-historia-de-uma-vida-malvada/|access-date=2021-01-17|language=pt-PT}}</ref>
