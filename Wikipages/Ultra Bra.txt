'''Ultra Bra''' was a Finnish band, formed in 1994 by [[Olli Virtaperko]] and [[Kerkko Koskinen]], and disbanded in 2001.

==Band history==
In 1994, Olli Virtaperko heard about a political song contest held by the Finnish Democratic Youth League (predecessor of the [[Left Youth (Finland)|Left Youth]], the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]]'s youth organisation) and decided to enter it with his friend Kerkko Koskinen. Koskinen composed several songs based on lyrics from his friends. A group of singers and musicians was assembled and the new band won the contest with their song "Ampukaa komissaarit, nuo hullut koirat" (''Shoot the commissioners, those mad dogs'').

In the summer of 1995, they released their first EP, "Houkutusten kiihottava maku". Over the course of the recording sessions, they also came up with a name for the band: Ultra Bra (which means "''Very Good''" in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]). During 1995, many new people joined the band, while others left. However, the lineup started to become fixed towards the end of the year. By the end of the year [[Anni Sinnemäki]], Koskinen's wife who was to become the most celebrated of all UB's lyricists, began writing lyrics, starting with "Sankaritar" and "Ken Saro-Wiwa on kuollut". (The latter song refers to Nigerian environmental activist [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]], and the circumstances surrounding his execution. The statement he made before his execution is specifically referenced.)

Their first full-length album, ''Vapaaherran elämää'', came out in the autumn of 1996. All the while, they had been doing a lot of touring and their live reputation had become substantial. In 1997, the second album ''Kroketti'' came out. With the release of this album Ultra Bra really started to gain fame. ''Kroketti'' sold very well, remains their best selling album and contains some of their biggest hits, namely "Sinä lähdit pois" ("You Went Away") and "Minä suojelen sinua kaikelta" ("I Shall Protect You From Everything").

In 1998, they participated in the contest for a song to represent Finland in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. Ultra Bra did not win, but their entry, "Tyttöjen välisestä ystävyydestä" ("About Friendship Between Girls"), became a hit song. The third album, ''Kalifornia'', was released in the spring of 1999. In early 2000, Ultra Bra again participated in the Finnish Eurovision song selection process, with "Kaikki on hetken tässä" ("In This Moment, Everything's here") without reaching the final round. In the spring, they also released several new singles. The song "Heikko valo" ("The Weak Light") also featured in the Finnish movie ''[[Restless (2000 film)|Levottomat]]'' (''The Restless'').

Their fourth album, ''Vesireittejä'', came out on 13 October 2000. The week before it was released, numerous magazines and newspapers wrote articles about them, and they appeared on TV and on the radio. ''Vesireittejä'' went number one – and gold – on its first week in the Finnish charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://yle.fi/radiomafia/lista/arkisto/arkisto.20001022.html|title=Suomen virallinen lista – 42/00 – The Official Finnish Chart|publisher=[[YLE]] |access-date=27 June 2011 }}</ref>

==The end of Ultra Bra==
In the summer before the release of ''Vesireittejä'', Ultra Bra decided they would continue for only about a year and then quit and start doing something else. In October 2001, they released a compilation album, ''Sinä päivänä kun synnyin'', that contained a few new songs and many rarities, along with a music video tape and music book. After this they did a small tour of seven gigs, quitting on 20 October 2001, with maximum media coverage, surrounded by thousands of fans.
