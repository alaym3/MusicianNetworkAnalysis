'''Manfred Mann's Earth Band''' is an English rock band formed by South African musician [[Manfred Mann (musician)|Manfred Mann]]. Their hits include covers of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[For You (Bruce Springsteen song)|For You]]", "[[Blinded by the Light]]" and "[[Spirit in the Night]]". After forming in 1971 and with a short hiatus in the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Earth Band continues to perform and tour.

==History==
===Formation===
[[File:Manfred Mann's earth band (ZMF 2017) jm37458.jpg|thumb|Manfred Mann's Earth Band, [[Zelt-Musik-Festival]] 2017 in [[Freiburg]], Germany]]
Keyboardist [[Manfred Mann (musician)|Manfred Mann]] started in the 1960s with the [[Manfred Mann|self-titled]] band that had such hits as "[[Do Wah Diddy Diddy]]" and Bob Dylan's "[[Quinn the Eskimo (Mighty Quinn)|The Mighty Quinn]]" and then moved on to jazz fusion-inspired [[Manfred Mann Chapter Three]] before forming the Earth Band in 1971. 
Feeling that Chapter Three had suffered from too many self-imposed rules, being frustrated with mostly only playing [[Mike Hugg]]'s compositions and not being an economically feasible venture (due to the amount of involved musicians) were all reasons for forming the new group, which was open to songs from outside the band (like Mann's earlier groups) and developed due to the different musical backgrounds of its members as opposed to adhering to a strict musical concept.

The original line-up consisted of Mick Rogers (guitar and vocals), Manfred Mann (keyboards, [[Minimoog]] [[synthesizer]] and vocals), [[Colin Pattenden]] (bass guitar) and Chris Slade (drums and vocals).<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=792}}</ref> In its very earliest stages, the band was sometimes billed as "Manfred Mann" and thus a continuation of the 1960s group, sometimes as "Manfred Mann Chapter Three" due to that being the most recent incarnation of Mann's career. The quartet released their first single, [[Bob Dylan|Bob Dylan's]] "[[Please, Mrs. Henry]]", in 1971, simply credited to "Manfred Mann". A debut album "Stepping Sideways" was recorded but not released because the band's style was rapidly maturing, and the group felt it wasn't representative of their live act anymore. In September 1971, a new name was chosen. Manfred Mann suggested a title containing "band" (which almost rhymes with "Mann") and after considering the likes of "Arm Band", "Head Band" and "Elastic Band", Chris Slade suggested "Earth Band", a name both related to the band's originally straightforward musical style and the ecological movement ongoing at the time.<ref name="Mannerisms, p. 121">Greg Russo, ''Mannerisms – The five phases of Manfred Mann (Revised Edition)'', Crossfire Publications, 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-9791845-2-9}}, p.121</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Chris Slade Interview (Sept 2019) Manfred Mann Name Change|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWRy-pOBgT8|language=en|access-date=2021-05-26}}</ref>

Their second single, [[Randy Newman]]'s "Living Without You", was still credited to 'Manfred Mann' in Europe, but by 'Manfred Mann's Earth Band' in the US, where the track became a minor chart hit.<ref name="Larkin"/> On two non-charting single releases in the UK in 1972/73, the group was billed simply as 'Earth Band', but otherwise, from 1972 forward, 'Manfred Mann's Earth Band' was the band name used on all releases. The membership of the Earth Band was stable between 1971 and 1976, during which time they released their first six albums. The iconic logo, which appeared on the band's most future album covers, debuted on the second released LP [[Glorified Magnified]].

=== Themes ===
The Earth Band combines the stylistic approach of [[progressive rock]] with Mann's [[jazz]]-influenced Moog synthesizer playing and keen ear for melody. Beside producing their own material, a staple of the band's music and live performances from the beginning has been also relying on covers of songs by other modern pop/rock artists, notably [[Bob Dylan]] and Bruce Springsteen, in their progressive rock style.

Mann's interest in English 20th century [[European classical music|classical music]] saw him adapt [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets|Planets Suite]]'' and turn a version of the "Jupiter" movement into a UK hit entitled "Joybringer" (perhaps surprisingly excluded from the 1973 album ''[[Solar Fire]]'').<ref name="Larkin"/> Other classical music adaptations include "Questions" from the 1976 album ''[[The Roaring Silence]]'' (which is based on the main theme of [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[Impromptus (Schubert)#No.&nbsp;3 in G-flat major|Impromptu in G flat Major]]), "Solar Fire is in Earth, the Circle, Pt. 1" (which uses the melody from [[Claude Debussy]]'s "Jimbo's Lullaby") and "Starbird" also from 1976's ''The Roaring Silence'' (which is based upon [[Igor Stravinski]]'s ballet ''[[The Firebird]]'').

The title song to 1973's ''[[Messin']]'' (written by Mike Hugg and originally recorded by Chapter Three on their unissued third album), as well as most of the 1974 album ''[[The Good Earth (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)|The Good Earth]]'', tapped into ecological concerns, a recurring theme in Mann's music in later years, with ''The Good Earth'' giving away a free gift of a piece of land in [[Wales]] with each album sold.

Like other [[prog-rock]] acts, the band also issued concept albums on space and sci-fi themes (particularly the 1973 album ''[[Solar Fire]]'' and the singles "Launching Place" off the 1974 ''[[The Good Earth (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)|The Good Earth]]'' and "Starbird" off the 1976 ''[[The Roaring Silence]]'') and religious or biblical imagery ("Prayer" on the band's debut album, "Buddah" on ''Messin''', Dylan's "Father of Day, Father of Night" and "In the Beginning, Darkness" on ''Solar Fire'', "The Road to Babylon" and "This Side of Paradise" on ''The Roaring Silence'' and "Resurrection" on the 1979 ''[[Angel Station]]'').

Social criticism was also addressed ("[[Black and Blue (Chain song)|Black and Blue]]" on ''Messin''' dealt particularly with slavery and "Chicago Institute" on ''[[Watch (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)|Watch]]'' with mental institutions and science as a means of social control); a trend which grew throughout the 1980s, with songs such as ''Lies (Through the 1980s)'' on technological progress vs. social setbacks on ''[[Chance (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)|Chance]]'' (1980), and with Mann's growing involvement with the [[anti-apartheid movement]] which was featured on the 1982 album ''[[Somewhere in Afrika (album)|Somewhere in Afrika]]''. Mann's intention for acknowledgement of oppressed ethnic groups also influenced the 1992 album ''[[Plains Music]]'', which featured traditional [[Native American music]].

===1970s===
The group's sixth album, 1975's ''[[Nightingales & Bombers]]'', took its title from a [[World War II]] naturalist's recording of a [[nightingale]] singing in a garden as warplanes flew overhead; the recording appears in a track on the album (the US version included an extra track, a cover of Bob Dylan's; "[[Quit Your Low Down Ways]]" sung by Mick Rogers). After this album, Mick Rogers left the band (temporarily, and he still contributed backing vocals to the next album). He was replaced by two musicians, [[Chris Thompson (English musician)|Chris Thompson]] (lead vocals, guitar) and [[Dave Flett]] (lead guitar, backing vocals).

The US breakthrough for the band came in the third week of February 1977, when they charted at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with a [[Cover version|cover]] of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "[[Blinded by the Light]]" from ''[[The Roaring Silence]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/>

''The Roaring Silence'' also featured a guest appearance by jazz saxophonist [[Barbara Thompson (musician)|Barbara Thompson]]. Taking advantage of the publicity of their hit song, the band re-released another Springsteen song, "[[Spirit in the Night]]", re-titled "Spirits in the Night", which the band had released the previous year on ''Nightingales & Bombers'', in a vocally re-cut version with Chris Thompson taking a new lead vocal in place of Mick Rogers' vocal on the original album version.

Following these popular successes, the Earth Band released the album ''Watch'' (1978), which produced another UK hit single in "Davy's on the Road Again".<ref name="Larkin"/> This song, as well as the re-recording of "[[Quinn the Eskimo (The Mighty Quinn)|Mighty Quinn]]" (also released as a single to celebrate the original 1968 hit's tenth anniversary), was recorded live with studio overdubs. Before the recording of the album, original bassist Colin Pattenden had departed and was replaced by [[Pat King]].<ref name="Larkin"/>

===1980s===
Drummer Chris Slade and lead guitarist Dave Flett left before 1979's ''[[Angel Station (album)|Angel Station]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> It was announced that Chris Thompson would also be leaving at this same time to pursue his own group, [[Night (rock band)|Night]], but Night quickly faded after scoring two hits and Thompson was back in time for the Earth Band's next album and tour. Flett was replaced by guitarist [[Steve Waller]], who shared lead vocals with Thompson. [[Geoff Britton]] played drums on the album but was soon replaced by John Lingwood, due to illness.

1980's ''[[Chance (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)|Chance]]'', featuring several guest vocalists alongside Thompson, Mann and Waller, showed a move towards a more electronic approach and produced several cuts that were hits in the UK and/or saw significant airplay in both the US and UK, with the songs "Lies (All Through the 80's)" sung by Thompson, "Stranded" and "For You" (another Springsteen song sung by Thompson). [[Trevor Rabin]], a fellow South African and London session musician, and lead guitarist of the 1980s version of [[Yes (band)|Yes]], guested on the album, as did original Earth Band guitarist Mick Rogers. Bassist Pat King left the group in 1982 to be replaced by bassist/guitarist [[Matt Irving]].

By this time, Mann had become personally active in the international anti-apartheid movement and was banned from entering his home country of South Africa. Undeterred, members of the band made journeys to South Africa to record African musicians for the 1983 album ''[[Somewhere in Afrika]]''.<ref name="Larkin"/> The album included a cover of [[The Police]]'s "[[Demolition Man (song)|Demolition Man]]" (sung by Steve Waller) and a version of [[Bob Marley]]'s "[[Redemption Song]]".

The accompanying tour (incorporating visual effects such as cartoons, robots and exploding amplifiers) was a big success and led to the [[Budapest Live|Budapest]] live album, which was later followed by a DVD of the TV broadcast. After this tour, Steve Waller left the band. Mick Rogers returned, taking Waller's place.

In 1984 the band issued the single "[[Runner (song)|Runner]]", a cover of the song by [[Ian Thomas (Canadian musician)|Ian Thomas]], which had been written in response to cancer sufferer [[Terry Fox]] and his run across Canada for cancer awareness. Fox had succumbed to the cancer before finishing. The Manfred Mann version featured Chris Thompson on lead vocals and Mick Rogers on backing vocals.  The song was a non-LP single in the UK but was included on the US release of ''Somewhere in Afrika''. It was a top 40 hit in both Canada and the US and was used during ABC's broadcasting of the 1984 Summer Olympics and in the film ''[[The Philadelphia Experiment (film)|The Philadelphia Experiment]]''. At 22 on the Hot 100 it was their biggest hit since "[[Blinded by the Light]]" and was the band's second highest-charting song, as well as their final US/UK chart single.

Irving exited the group shortly after the single. Steve Kinch played bass on this album ''Criminal Tango'' (1986), which featured both Mick Rogers and Chris Thompson on vocals. For 1987's ''[[Masque (Manfred Mann's Earth Band album)|Masque]]'' album, the band consisted solely of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers and drummer John Lingwood. Shortly thereafter, the Earth Band name was retired for four years.

===Recent years===
Manfred Mann's Earth Band was revived in 1991 with a lineup of Manfred Mann, Mick Rogers, Steve Kinch, singer [[Noel McCalla]] and former [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] drummer [[Clive Bunker]] and resumed recording, covering tracks by artists as varied as [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[Robert Cray]], [[Del Amitri]] and [[The Lovin' Spoonful]]. Mann has also released solo projects, including ''[[Plains Music (album)|Plains Music]]'', which was based on Native American music, and ''[[2006 (album)|2006]]'', which includes collaborations with the German rapper [[Thomas D]] and tracks featuring the music of, amongst others, the [[Super Furry Animals]].

The Earth Band has had a fluctuating line-up, with Mann being the only continuous member. After drummer Clive Bunker left in 1996, he was succeeded by [[John Trotter (drummer)|John Trotter]] (1996-2000), Richard Marcangelo (2000–2002), Pete May (2002), [[Geoff Dunn]] (2002–2007), [[Jimmy Copley]] (2007–2015) and then a returning John Lingwood in 2016. Vocalist/guitarist Chris Thompson returned in 1996 to sing alongside Mick Rogers and Noel McCalla until 1999 (then again in 2004, briefly). McCalla was replaced by Peter Cox in 2009, but returned in 2010 for a short time filling in for Cox. Since Cox departed in early 2011, [[Robert Hart (musician)|Robert Hart]] (ex-[[Bad Company]]) has been the singer, along with Mick Rogers.

Most of the band's original albums have been re-released in recent years and a 4-CD set (''[[Odds & Sods - Mis-takes & Out-takes]]'') featuring many previously unissued versions of tracks was released in August 2005. This includes material from the unreleased (and thought to be lost) Manfred Mann ''Chapter III Volume 3'' album and the first Earth Band album, ''Stepping Sideways''. The fourth CD in the package includes both unreleased studio material and live performances.

December 2006 saw the release of the DVD ''Unearthed 1973–2005 The Best of Manfred Mann's Earth Band''. This features twenty tracks ranging from three recorded in Sweden in 1973 ("Father of Day", "Captain Bobby Stout" and "Black & Blue") to a 2005 performance of "Mighty Quinn". Also included are animations used during the band's live performances of the late 1970s and early 1980s and promo films (including two tracks from the ''Plains Music'' album).

In 2007 two separate dance remixes of Bruce Springsteen songs as performed by Manfred Mann's Earth Band entered the Austrian Charts. The first was a remix of "[[Blinded by the Light]]", which was credited to ''Michael Mind featuring Manfred Mann's Earth Band''. The second was a remix of "For You", credited to ''The Disco Boys featuring Manfred Mann's Earth Band''. Also in 2007, the 1983 Budapest concert was released in DVD format and included tracks not previously available.

In 2008 the band released the ''Watch'' DVD which includes footage from a 1979 Austrian concert.<ref>{{cite web|title=Manfred Mann|url=http://www.classicbands.com/manfred.html|website=ClassicBands.com|access-date=2 May 2015}}</ref>

In 2010 the song "You Are - I Am" from ''Angel Station'' was sampled by [[Kanye West]] on his critically acclaimed album: ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]].''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kanye West, Swizz Beatz and Jay-Z feat.
