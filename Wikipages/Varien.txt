She is known for her work on film soundtracks, along with her unconventional approach to electronic music, including many live instruments not normally found on tracks within her genres.

==Early life==
Kaelar was born on May 15, 1990 in [[Tampa, Florida]]. She had a connection to music from a very young age,<ref name="EDM.com June 2019" /> and her family supported her passion. At the age of 11, Varien began playing the guitar and attempting songwriting,<ref name="UKF">{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Dave|date=January 27, 2015|title=Exclusive: Varien is about to blow minds with her new album!|url=https://ukf.com/words/exclusive-varien-blow-minds-new-album|access-date=October 30, 2017|work=[[UKF Music]]}}</ref> and she joined a number of bands experimenting with genres of [[Rock music|rock]], [[grindcore]], [[metalcore]], and [[Jazz music|jazz]]. Kaelar developed [[perfect pitch]] when playing the keyboard at age fourteen.

Kaelar was in multiple bands in high school, playing [[grindcore]], [[metalcore]], [[screamo]], [[post-hardcore]], and [[power metal]] before joining her school's [[Jazz]] band for two years. She cites these years as pivotal to her artistic development, learning sheet music, jazz theory and improvisation. She also cites this as the time she developed a profound interest in [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Folk music|folk]], and [[Metal (genre)|metal]] music.<ref>{{cite web|title=NP Unzipped: Varien|url=http://noiseprn.com/2013/05/10/noiseporn-unzipped-varien |date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=July 7, 2019}}</ref>

She decided to focus on solo composition and began producing in 2009, with music in video games serving as her most longtime influence to date.<ref name="UKF" /> She cites [[Shin Megami Tensei]], [[Final Fantasy]], and [[Metroid]] as her biggest influences when it comes to games, as well as the works of [[the Wachowskis]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-12-09|title=Up Close and Personal with elusive US producer Varien|url=https://ihouseu.com/up-close-and-personal-with-elusive-us-producer-varien/|access-date=2020-06-09|website=IhouseU.com|language=en-GB}}</ref>

[[File:Varien 2020.jpg|thumb|Nikki Kaelar in 2020]]

In August 2010, Kaelar achieved online [[viral phenomenon|virality]] with her slowed-down remix of [[Justin Bieber]]'s "[[U Smile]]", titled "Justin Bieber 800% Slowed Down". She was interviewed by ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' and [[MTV]] about the track.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lyons|first=Margaret|title=The man who slowed down Justin Bieber: 'It was a joke, and now it's this phenomenon'|url=https://ew.com/article/2010/08/18/justin-bieber-u-smile-slow/|access-date=2020-03-23|website=Ew.com}}</ref>

In July 2011, Kaelar released her first [[Monstercat]] single "The Force" under the alias Halo Nova. She subsequently released two more singles under the alias before abandoning it and continuing to make music under the alias Varien. One of the first subsequent releases as Varien was a remix of [[Ephixa]]'s song "Division".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.suburbanapologist.com/listen-variens-formerly-halo-nova-remix-of-ephixas-division/|title=LISTEN: Varien's (formerly Halo Nova) remix of Ephixa's "Division" - Suburban Apologist|date=October 26, 2011|work=Suburban Apologist|access-date=February 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170227233315/http://www.suburbanapologist.com/listen-variens-formerly-halo-nova-remix-of-ephixas-division/|archive-date=February 27, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

On February 26, 2013, Kaelar released ''Pick Your Poison Vol. 1'', a compilation album of [[Trailer music|trailer cues]] that she wrote for the purpose of film, television, and video game licensing. She released a followup, ''Pick Your Poison Vol. 2'', a year later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pluggedinpromotions.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/varien-releases-pick-your-poison-vol-02/|title=Varien Releases "Pick Your Poison Vol. 02"|date=January 27, 2014|access-date=February 27, 2017}}</ref>

===2014–16: ''The Ancient & Arcane'' and ''My Prayers Have Become Ghosts''===
In 2014, Kaelar teamed up with [[Two Steps from Hell]] on a private trailer cue compilation entitled ''Open Conspiracy''. 2014 saw an abundance of licenses for Varien. Her music was used in trailers and promotional media for ''[[300: Rise of an Empire]]'', ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', ''[[The Purge: Anarchy]]'', ''[[Face Off (American TV series)|Face Off]]'', ''[[America's Next Top Model]]'', ''[[PlanetSide 2]]'', and ''[[Monsters: Dark Continent]]''. Los Angeles-based singer Roniit's song "Runaway", produced by Varien, was used in multiple trailers and TV spots for the film ''[[The Loft (2014 film)|The Loft]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://trailermusicnews.com/2014/06/two-steps-from-hell-open-conspiracy/|title=Two Steps From Hell: Open Conspiracy « Trailer Music News|website=trailermusicnews.com|access-date=February 27, 2017}}</ref>

On August 5, 2015, Kaelar released her first LP, titled ''The Ancient & Arcane'', on Monstercat. Prior to this, she had released two tracks, "Beyond the Surface" and "Aether and Light". In an interview with [[UKF Music|UKF]], she elaborated on her songwriting process for the album, saying: "I make so many other types of music so I thought I’d sit down and write – no theme, no story. It’s a very Zen experience. Very spiritual. Wake up. Do [[yoga]]. Make music. No regard for the club. No regard for where it will be played or comparisons to my past music or anything else that's going on. I’ve never gone to any of these places I’m exploring right now. I want people to listen to it and think ‘is this Varien?’ Psychedelic, worldly, ethnic, trippy... People have never seen me go there. Yet."<ref name="UKF" />

''The Ancient & Arcane'' met with critical acclaim upon release, with EDM website ''Dancing Astronaut'' calling it a "cinematic masterpiece", giving particular praise to "Ghost Spores" as "reinvigorat[ing] the soul with its harp-tinged melody and orchestral instruments that once again highlight Varien's idiosyncratic musicianship."<ref>{{cite web|title=Varien's debut album 'The Ancient & Arcane' is a cinematic masterpiece|url=http://www.dancingastronaut.com/2015/08/variens-debut-album-ancient-arcane-cinematic-masterpiece/|last=Diaz|first=Jordan|work=[[Dancing Astronaut]]|date=August 10, 2015|access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>

Kaelar's next EP, ''My Prayers Have Become Ghosts'', was released on October 31, 2016 via Monstercat.

===2017–2018: Hiatus and Return===
In 2017, Kaelar announced a hiatus from the Varien alias and removed all of her social media accounts. Across two interviews with ''EDMSauce'', she cited the psychological impact of social media as her reason for going on a blackout,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.edmsauce.com/2017/10/27/varien-goes-social-media-blackout-mean-edmsauce-exclusive-interview/|title=Varien Goes On a Social Media Blackout...

In April 2018, Kaelar wrote, arranged, and produced K-Pop group [[VIXX]]'s lead single for their album ''[[Eau de VIXX]]'', "Scentist". The track went on to hit #1 on the [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]] charts and was licensed for Korean television shows like ''[[The Return of Superman (TV series)|The Return of Superman]]''.

On October 2nd, 2018 Kaelar was quoted in RPGamer talking about her youth and which RPGs and video games inspired her career as a producer and composer. Kaeler comments that she always knew that she wanted to be a video game composer when she "grew up," and that if the opportunity came to her she would go for it. She explained in the article, "The thing is video game [composers themselves are], and especially the JRPG community, [are] very much a Fort Knox. There's a limited amount of people and they’re the best."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fuller |first1=Alex |title=Nick Kaelar (Varien) Interview |url=https://rpgamer.com/2018/10/nick-kaelar-varien-interview/ |website=RPGamer |page=1}}</ref>

It's easy to be able to see the sort of scenes or environments that one would expect from a JRPG while listening to those particular tracks." Varien's collaboration with Materia Collective<ref>{{cite web |title=Straight From the Underground |url=https://www.materiacollective.com/music/straight-from-the-underground |website=Materia Collective |publisher=Materia Collective |access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref> was mentioned in the interview and the official remix with Undertale is featured.  

On October 26, 2018, Varien released her next EP, ''Death Asked a Question'', through Most Addictive Records.<ref name="deathaskedaquestion" /> In an interview with EDM Joy, she described the EP as being the physical manifestation of her struggles during her hiatus, in contrast to the "fantastical" narrative of ''The Ancient & Arcane''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edmjoy.com/2018/10/varien-2018-interview/|title=Interview With Varien On Mental Health & Coming EP|date=October 15, 2018|access-date=June 19, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620005544/https://edmjoy.com/2018/10/varien-2018-interview/|archive-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref>

On July 13, 2018 Kaelar is featured in an exclusive EDM Sauce interview talking about direct influences of her work, which includes Y2K Era, [[Fight Club]], [[The Matrix]], BBs forums for Final Fantasy, [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[A Perfect Circle]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[KoRn]], and "cool new electronic music like Drum n Bass, Trip Hop, etc," as what she declares as her "favorite era [of music]." The EDM Sauce article features Varien's statement about her 2017 hiatus, declaring that she was being "ground down" by the industry and needed a break from it all. Kaelar stated that she returned with a newly radically and positive mindset surrounded by a community of support and friends. The author, GLU[15], declares, "Varien is an enigma. Creative on levels I don't think we have yet to catch up to; [Nikki] has been building a fan base for years. The Floridian producer effortlessly dominates any genre [she] touches."<ref>{{cite web |last=GLU |title=Varien Rises From Ashes Victorious [EDMSAUCE EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW] |url=https://www.edmsauce.com/2018/07/13/varien-rises-from-ashes/ |website=EDMSauce |date=July 13, 2018 |publisher=EDMSauce |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref>

On October 26, 2018, Kaelar released an EP, Death Asked A Question, premiered through EDM website Dancing Astronaut in which Kaelar describes the EP as soul-searching, expressive, personal, raw, and featuring numerous gaming influences. Kaelar also described it as having "so much [[Metroid]] it's not even funny!" In the Dancing Astronaut premiere and interview the author, Robyn Dexter, quoted Varien and the newly released EP as "consistently [surpassing] genre constructs and [proving herself] a true mastermind of the electronic music realm."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dexter |first1=Robyn |title=Varien weaves a dark and vulnerable web in 'Death Asked A Question' [EP Premiere + Interview] |url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2018/10/varien-death-asked-a-question-premiere-interview/ |website=Dancing Astronaut |date=October 25, 2018 |publisher=Dancing Astronaut |access-date=November 1, 2020}}</ref>

In January of 2018, Varien played at [[MAGfest]], an organization dedicated to the appreciation of games and video game music. On January 1, 2019 featured in Big Shot Magazine, Varien speaks of that performance and describes herself as being fully "back [from her hiatus]" and that she "felt that feeling of performing again for the first time in so long."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fleming |first1=Ian |title=2018 REWIND: VARIEN |url=https://newsflash.bigshotmag.com/features/58765/ |website=Big Shot Magazine |publisher=Newsflash |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref>

===2019–present===

On January 1, 2019, in Bigshot Magazine, Kaelar looks back on her 2018 musical highlights throughout the year and reflects,"I’d definitely say landing the VIXX track "Scentist" [in 2018] which went to number one in Korea in April, and then number three in October in Japan. This marked my first official placement in the K-Pop realm of which there is so much more to come. I was credited as producer, songwriter, and arranger.”

Kaelar's next full album release, "The Second Industrial Revolution" was on December 5, 2019. The album was renowned and extolled by critics, and was quoted as being uncompromising, daring and utterly raw. Broadway World Music reviewed the album, "At its essence the album is a celebration of this "imperfect", exalting the artistic beauty and freedom that lies in surrender to that. From the very start of the album, in titular single 'THE SECOND INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION', there is a grainy, clipping quality to the production this is far removed from the polished normalcy of much of today's electronica, carried through as the album begins its descent into darkness." 

Referring to the album, Varien speaks about wanting to connect with her imperfect, marginalized and "weird" audience, saying, "Throw away the shrink wrap and throw yourself into the abyss with me." It was also stated that the album The Second Industrial Revolution was produced "in the pits of [Kaelar's] deepest depression," and "[lifted her] through the dark times" as well as resulted in a physical relocation of Kaelar to the Northern European country of Finland. 

The Broadway World Music article also states, "Adored by critics and followed with a feverish, almost cult-like manner by fans, elusive US electronic producer Varien ... continues to push the boundaries of [her] chosen genres from [her] position within the shadows of American musical counter culture. [Hers] is a unique space, flexing across countless areas within music but continually refusing to compromise or dilute [her] work."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Crandall |first1=Madeline |title=Varien Release New Album, 'The Second Industrial Revolution' |url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Varien-Release-New-Album-The-Second-Industrial-Revolution-20191206 |website=Broadway World |publisher=TV News Desk |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref>

On December 23rd, 2019 Relentless Beats reviewed the album and stated it to be a complete masterpiece as well as one of their favorite albums of 2019. In the review they stated, "Overall, The Second Industrial Revolution truly blew me away. The transitions from grungy, distorted basses to soft, elegant melodies was effortless and the story lies in these musical parallels. On one hand, the world Varien created was dark and meaningless, yet on the other it was beautiful and full of life." And concluded, "Everything Varien touches seems to turn into gold, no matter the genre."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Small |first1=Liz |title=Relentless Review: Varien's Latest Masterpiece 'The Second Industrial Revolution' |url=http://relentlessbeats.com/2019/12/relentless-review-variens-latest-masterpiece-the-second-industrial-revolution/ |website=Relentless Beats |publisher=Relentless Beats |access-date=November 25, 2020}}</ref>

In 2019, EDM.com described her as "[[Trent Reznor]] dark lord of this generation in electronic music". As one of Varien's most prominent features, EDM.com states that Kaelar is "on the same playing field," as [[Nine Inch Nails]] frontman Trent Reznor. The articles states, "It's hard to place someone on the same wavelength as Reznor, but Kaelar's Varien moniker has achieved immense success and garnered an unprecedented vision for music, something Reznor accomplished just as flawlessly. Varien is now coming around and finding [herself] as musician and artist."<ref name="EDM.com June 2019">{{Cite web|url=https://edm.com/interviews/varien-trent-reznor-dark-lord-electronic-music|title=Varien: Trent Reznor Dark Lord of This Generation in Electronic Music|date=June 12, 2019|access-date=June 19, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620005653/https://edm.com/interviews/varien-trent-reznor-dark-lord-electronic-music|archive-date=June 20, 2019}}</ref> 

On December 12, 2019 Raver Mag commented on Varien's prominent return to the industry, "After a well-documented ghosting of the music industry, [she] returned just over 12 months and since then has been on what can only be described as a production rampage, releasing not just electronica but also #1 K-Pop hit singles and soundtracks for movies like [[John Wick 3]] and [[Replicants]]." Kaelar stated in the interview that when writing The Second Industrial Revolution she drew a lot of her time from writing K-Pop because that's what taught her the mechanics of writing hooks and catchy rhythms. She comments that there is songs on the album  that feature "an element of queer too.”

Kaelar states in the Raver Mag feature that she believes art, poetry, theory, [[philosophy]] combined with razor sharp logic, rationality, reasoning, and critical thinking can assist in practical ways of dealing with the world. In the interview, she also states that if she had the choice to bring whoever she wanted to dinner dead or alive, she would choose Lana Wachowski, [[David Foster Wallace]], [[Chuck Palahniuk]], [[Marilyn Manson]], and [[Brit Marling]]. She concluded the interview by stating that if she had to be remembered for saying anything she would want it to be the statement,"That I lived life to its fullest and always dared to try."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bailey |first1=Kat |title=Varien dives into The Second Industrial Revolution – Interview |url=https://aws.ravermag.com/varien-dives-into-the-second-industrial-revolution-interview/ |website=RaverMag |date=December 12, 2019 |publisher=RaverMag |access-date=November 15, 2020}}</ref>
