'''The Specials''', also known as '''The Special AKA''', are an English [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] and [[ska]] revival band formed in 1977 in [[Coventry]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=2006 |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |edition=19th |publisher=Guinness World Records Limited |location=London |isbn=1-904994-10-5 |page=519}}</ref> After some early changes, the first stable lineup of the group consisted of [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]] and [[Neville Staple]] on vocals, [[Lynval Golding]] and [[Roddy Radiation]] on guitars, [[Horace Panter]] on bass, [[Jerry Dammers]] on keyboards, [[John Bradbury (drummer)|John Bradbury]] on drums, and [[Dick Cuthell]] and [[Rico Rodriguez (musician)|Rico Rodriguez]] on horns.  Their music combines a "danceable ska and [[rocksteady]] beat with punk's energy and attitude".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-specials-mn0000482334 |title=The Specials |author=Chris Woodstra |work=AllMusic}}</ref> Lyrically, they present a "more focused and informed political and social stance".

The band wore [[mod (subculture)|mod]]-style "1960s period [[rude boy]] outfits ([[pork pie hat]]s, tonic and [[mohair]] suits and loafers)".<ref>{{cite web |last=Woodstra |first=Chris |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5495|pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic.com |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> In 1980, the song "Too Much Too Young", the lead track on their ''[[The Special AKA Live!]]'' [[Extended play|EP]], reached No. 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book |first=Jo |last=Rice |year=1982 |title=The Guinness Book of 500 Number One Hits |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Superlatives Ltd |location=Enfield, Middlesex |page=201 |isbn=0-85112-250-7}}</ref> In 1981, the recession-themed single "[[Ghost Town (The Specials song)|Ghost Town]]" also hit No. 1 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

After seven consecutive UK [[Top 40|Top 10]] [[single (music)|singles]] between 1979 and 1981, main lead vocalists Hall and Staple, along with guitarist Golding, left to form [[Fun Boy Three]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> Continuing as "The Special AKA" (a name they used frequently on earlier Specials releases), a substantially revised Specials line-up issued new material until 1984, including the top 10 UK hit single "[[Free Nelson Mandela]]". After this, founder and songwriter [[Jerry Dammers]] dissolved the band and pursued political activism.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The group re-formed in 1993, and have continued to perform and record with varying line-ups, none of them involving Dammers.

==Career==
===Founding and early years (1977–78)===
The group was formed in 1977 by songwriter/keyboardist Dammers, vocalist Tim Strickland, guitarist/vocalist [[Lynval Golding]], drummer Silverton Hutchinson and bassist [[Horace Panter]] (a.k.a. Sir Horace Gentleman). Strickland was replaced by [[Terry Hall (singer)|Terry Hall]] shortly after the band's formation. The band was first called the Automatics, then the Coventry Automatics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thespecials.com/history.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070527022107/http://www.thespecials.com/history.php|url-status=dead|title=The Specials.com|archive-date=27 May 2007|access-date=1 February 2019}}</ref> Vocalist [[Neville Staple]] and guitarist Roddy Byers (usually known as [[Roddy Radiation]]) joined the band the following year; the new line-up changed their name to the Special AKA. [[Joe Strummer]] of [[the Clash]] had attended one of their concerts, and invited the Special AKA to open for his band in their "On Parole" UK tour. This performance gave the Special AKA a new level of national exposure, and they briefly shared the Clash's management.

The Specials began at the same time as [[Rock Against Racism]], which was first organised in 1978. According to Dammers, anti-racism was intrinsic to the formation of the Specials, in that the band was formed with the goal of integrating black and white people. Many years later Dammers stated that "Music gets political when there are new ideas in music, ...punk was innovative, so was ska, and that was why bands such as the Specials and the Clash could be political".<ref>Sarfraz Manzoor [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race The year rock found the power to unite] ''The Guardian'' (London), 20 April 2008. Retrieved 12 March 2009.</ref>

===Ascendancy of the Specials (1979–81)===
In 1979, shortly after drummer Hutchinson left the band to be replaced by [[John Bradbury (drummer)|John Bradbury]], Dammers formed the [[2 Tone Records]] [[record label|label]] and released the band's debut single "[[Gangsters (song)|Gangsters]]", a reworking of [[Prince Buster]]'s "[[Al Capone (song)|Al Capone]]". The record became a Top 10 hit that summer.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The band had begun wearing mod/rude boy/[[skinhead]]-style two-tone tonic suits, along with other elements of late 1960s teen fashions. Changing their name to the Specials, they recorded their [[The Specials (album)|eponymous debut album]] in 1979, produced by [[Elvis Costello]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book |first=Martin C. |last=Strong |year=2000 |title=The Great Rock Discography |edition=5th |publisher=Mojo Books |location=Edinburgh |pages=914–915 |isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> Horn players [[Dick Cuthell]] and [[Rico Rodriguez (musician)|Rico Rodriguez]] were featured on the album, but would not be official members of the Specials until their second album.

''The Specials'' led off with [[Dandy Livingstone]]'s "[[Rudy, A Message to You]]" (slightly altering the title to "A Message to You, Rudy") and also had [[cover version|covers]] of [[Prince Buster]] and [[Toots & the Maytals]] songs from the late 1960s. In 1980, the EP ''[[Too Much Too Young (EP)|Too Much Too Young]]'' (predominantly credited to the Special A.K.A.) was a [[List of number-one singles from the 1980s (UK)|No. 1]] hit in the UK Singles Chart,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> despite controversy over the song's lyrics, which reference teen pregnancy and promote [[Cervical cap|contraception]].<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book |first=David |last=Roberts |year=1998 |title=Guinness Rockopedia |edition=1st |publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd. |location=London |page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/409 409] |isbn=0-85112-072-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/409 }}</ref>

Reverting once again to the name of the Specials, the band's second album, ''[[More Specials]]'', was not as commercially successful and was recorded at a time when, according to Hall, conflicts had developed in the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davehaslam.com/control.php?_command=/DISPLAY/170/50//6000/6008 |title=Dave Haslam, Author and DJ – official site |website=Davehaslam.com |access-date=19 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304091439/http://www.davehaslam.com/control.php?_command=%2FDISPLAY%2F170%2F50%2F%2F6000%2F6008 |archive-date=4 March 2012}}</ref> Female backing vocalists on the Specials' first two studio albums included: [[Chrissie Hynde]]; [[Rhoda Dakar]] (then of [[The Bodysnatchers (band)|the Bodysnatchers]] and later of the Special AKA); and [[Belinda Carlisle]], [[Jane Wiedlin]] and [[Charlotte Caffey]] of [[the Go-Go's]]. In the first few months of 1981, the band took a break from recording and touring, and then released "Ghost Town", a non-album single, which hit No. 1 in 1981. At their ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' recording of the song, however, Staple, Hall and Golding announced they were leaving the band. Golding later said: "We didn't talk to the rest of the guys. We couldn't even stay in the same dressing room. We couldn't even look at each other. We stopped communicating. You only realise what a genius Jerry was years later. At the time, we were on a different planet."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/mar/08/artsfeatures.popandrock |title=The Specials and the story of the UK's most remarkable chart-topper |first=Alexis |last=Petridis |date=8 March 2002 |website=Theguardian.com |access-date=8 December 2017}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, the three left the band to form [[Fun Boy Three]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

===Band split, rebirth as the Special AKA (1982–84)===
For the next few years, the group was in a seemingly constant state of flux. Adding Dakar to the permanent line-up, the group recorded "[[The Boiler (song)|The Boiler]]" with Dakar on vocals, Dammers on keyboards, Bradbury on drums, John Shipley (from the Swinging Cats) on guitar, Cuthell on brass and Nicky Summers on bass. The single was credited to "Rhoda with the Special AKA". The track describes an incident of [[date rape]], and its frank and harrowing depiction of the matter meant that airplay was severely limited. Nevertheless, it managed to reach No. 35 on the UK charts, and American writer [[Dave Marsh]] later identified "The Boiler" as one of the 1,001 best "rock and soul" singles of all time in his book ''The Heart of Rock & Soul''.

After going on tour with Rodriguez, the band (without Dakar, and as "Rico and the Special AKA") also recorded the non-charting (and non-album) single "Jungle Music". The line-up for the single was Rodriguez (vocal, trombone), Cuthell (cornets), Dammers (keyboards), Bradbury (drums), Shipley (guitar), returning bassist Panter, and new additions Satch Dickson and Groco (percussion) and Anthony Wymshurst (guitar).

Rodriguez and the three newcomers were all dropped for the next single, "War Crimes", which brought back Dakar and added new co-vocalists Egidio Newton and Stan Campbell, as well as violinist Nick Parker. Follow-up single "Racist Friend" was a minor hit (UK No. 60), with the band establishing themselves as a septet: Dakar, Newton, Campbell, Bradbury, Cuthell, Dammers and Shipley.

The new line-up (still known as the Special AKA) finally issued a new full-length album ''[[In the Studio]]'' in 1984. Officially, the band was now a sextet: Dakar, Campbell, Bradbury, Dammers, Shipley and new bassist Gary McManus. Cuthell, Newton, Panter and Radiation all appeared on the album as guests; as did saxophonist Nigel Reeve, and [[Claudia Fontaine]] and [[Caron Wheeler]] of the vocal trio [[Afrodiziak]]. Both critically and commercially, ''In The Studio'' was less successful than previous efforts, although the 1984 single "Free Nelson Mandela" was a No. 9 UK hit.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The latter contributed to making [[Nelson Mandela|Mandela]]'s imprisonment a [[wikt:cause célèbre|cause célèbre]] in the UK, and became popular with anti-[[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid]] activists in South Africa. Dammers then dissolved the band and pursued political activism.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

==Later developments==
Since the break-up of the original line-up, various members of the band performed in other bands and have reformed several times to tour and record in Specials-related projects. However, there has never been a complete reunion of the original line-up.

After their departure from the Specials, Golding, Hall and Staple founded the pop band Fun Boy Three and enjoyed commercial success from 1981 to 1983 with hits such as "[[The Tunnel of Love (Fun Boy Three song)|Tunnel of Love]]", "[[T'ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)|It Ain't What You Do (It's the Way That You Do It)]]", "[[Our Lips Are Sealed]]" and "The Lunatics (Have Taken Over the Asylum)". The group ended with Hall's sudden departure, leading to a 15-year rift with Staple.<ref>Neville Staple with Tony McMahon, ''Original Rude Boy: From Borstal to the Specials'', Chapter 9: "Bhangra House".</ref>

After Fun Boy Three, Staple and Golding joined Pauline Black of [[the Selecter]] in the short-lived band Sunday Best, releasing the single "Pirates on the Airwaves".

In 1990, Bradbury, Golding, Panter and Staple teamed up with members of [[The Beat (British band)|the Beat]] to form Special Beat,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> performing the music of the two bands and other ska and Two Tone classics. The group, undergoing many line-up changes, toured and released several live recordings through the 1990s.

A 1994 single credited to "X Specials" featured Staple, Golding, Radiation, and Panter. A cover of the [[Slade]] song "Coz I Love You", the project was produced by Slade's [[Jim Lea (musician)|Jim Lea]].

Moving into production and management, Staple "discovered" and produced [[bhangra (music)|bhangra]] pop fusion artist [[Johnny Zee]]. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Staple would stay active producing and guesting with a variety of artists, including International Beat, Special Beat, [[Unwritten Law]], [[Desorden Publico]], [[the Planet Smashers]] and others, as well as leading his own bands and starting the Rude Wear clothing line. He sang with the 1990s Specials line-up, and again from 2009 to 2012.

Panter went on to join with members of the Beat and [[Dexys Midnight Runners]] to form [[General Public]], and then Special Beat. He joined the 1990s Specials before training as a primary school teacher at the [[University of Central England]] in Birmingham. He continued to play with latter-day Special [[Neol Davies]] in the blues outfit Box of Blues. However, he rejoined the band for their 2009 reunion and continues as a member.

Golding teamed up with Dammers for a brief spell of club DJing, and then worked with Coventry band After Tonight. After Special Beat, he went on to lead the [[Seattle]]-based ska groups Stiff Upper Lip, and more recently, [[Pama International]], as well as many collaborations with other ska bands. He has also toured with the Beat. He joined the 1990s Specials line-up, but left in 2000. He rejoined in 2009, and continues with the group.

Radiation fronted and worked with numerous artists including the Tearjerkers (a band that he had begun in the last months of the Specials), the Bonediggers, the Raiders and Three Men & Black (including [[Jean-Jacques Burnel]] of [[the Stranglers]]), [[Jake Burns]] ([[Stiff Little Fingers]]), Pauline Black, [[Bruce Foxton]] ([[the Jam]]), [[Dave Wakeling]] (the Beat, General Public) and Nick Welsh (Skaville UK). He also fronts [[the Skabilly Rebels]], a band that mixes [[rockabilly]] with ska. He joined the 1990s Specials line-up and again in 2009, continuing to 2014.

Bradbury continued through the Special AKA era, then formed the band JB's Allstars, before moving into production. He joined Special Beat for several years, then a reformed Selecter, before retiring from music to work as an IT specialist.<ref name="ReferenceA">Neville Staple with Tony McMahon, ''Original Rude Boy: From Borstal to the Specials''; Chapter 10: "The Third Wave – America Revives Ska".</ref> He rejoined the band for their 2009 reunion, and continued to perform with them until his death in 2015.

From 1984 until 1987, Hall fronted [[the Colourfield]], with some commercial success. After they disbanded, he pursued a solo career, working mostly in the [[New wave music|new wave]] genre. He co-wrote a number of early [[Lightning Seeds]] releases. He also performed some vocals for a [[Dub Pistols]] album. He and [[Eurythmics]] member [[David A. Stewart]] formed the duo [[Vegas (duo)|Vegas]] in the early 1990s, releasing an eponymous album in 1992. Hall joined the Specials for their 2009 reunion, and continues to perform with them.

In 2006, Dammers formed large, [[jazz]]-style ensemble [[the Spatial AKA Orchestra]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jerrydammers.co.uk/ |title=Jerry Dammers' Spatial A.K.A. Orchestra |website=Jerrydammers.co.uk}}</ref>

==Reunions and current events==
===The Specials Mk.2 (1993-1998)===
The first reunion under the Specials name occurred in 1993. Producer Roger Lomas was asked by Trojan Records to get some musicians together to back ska legend [[Desmond Dekker]] on a new album. He approached all members of The Specials and the four that were willing to participate were Roddy Radiation, Neville Staple, Lynval Golding and Horace Panter, they were also joined by Aitch Bembridge, who had been the drummer in The Selecter. Bembridge, had played with soul singer [[Ray King (singer)|Ray King]] in the 1970s, who mentored and worked with Dammers, Staple, Golding and Hutchinson in their days before the Specials.<ref>Original Rude Boy: From Borstal to the Specials by Neville Staple with Tony McMahon; Chapter 4: The Specials – The Rude Boys Arrive</ref> A group of studio musicians filled out the band, including keyboardist Mark Adams. The album, released by [[Trojan Records]] as ''[[Desmond Dekker#1980s and later|King of Kings]]'', was credited to Desmond Dekker and the Specials.

The release of the album with Desmond Dekker created some buzz for the band, and led to an offer from a Japanese promoter to book a tour. Rejoined by Golding, along with Bembridge & Adams from the "King of Kings" sessions, the band added horn players Adam Birch and Jonathan Read and began rehearsing and playing live. Initially using the names the Coventry Specials, The X Specials,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/The-X-Specials-Coz-I-Luv-You/release/8540285|title=The X Specials* - Coz I Luv You|website=Discogs.com|access-date=1 February 2020}}</ref> and Specials2, they shortly reverted to The Specials after accepting that it was the name promoters were using anyway,<ref name="ReferenceA"/><ref name="ReferenceB">Paul Williams, ''You're Wondering Now – The Specials from Conception to Reunion''; Part Two: "More Specials – Roddy Radiation".</ref> although the line-up was referred to as Specials MkII by those involved.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> This line-up went on to tour internationally and released two studio albums: ''[[Today's Specials]]'', a collection of mostly reggae and ska covers in 1996,<ref>name="The Great Rock Discography"/''[[Today's Specials]]''</ref> and ''[[Guilty 'til Proved Innocent!]]'' in 1998, a collection of original compositions. The band toured heavily in support of both releases - including headlining the  [[Vans Warped Tour]] - and received positive reviews of their live shows.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Despite the live success, the band fizzled out after a 1998 [[Japan]] tour (which Panter missed due to illness<ref>You're Wondering Now – The Specials from Conception to Reunion, by Paul Willams; Part Two: More Specials – Horace Panter</ref>), although limited touring with a different line-up continued into 2000.  The release of the earlier Trojan sessions, ''[[Skinhead Girl]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Conquering Ruler]]'' in 2001, would be the last heard from the band for some time.

After completing a similar project with The Selecter in 1999, Roger Lomas brought the group back into the studio to record a number of classic songs from the Trojan Records back catalogue. Two weeks before this project, Golding left the group to concentrate on domestic life in [[Seattle]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Turning to another [[The Selecter|Selecter]] veteran for help, the band replaced him on guitar with [[Neol Davies]]. Davies, Staple, Radiation and Panter, joined by a group of session musicians, recorded a wealth of tracks that eventually saw release by Trojan sub-label [[Trojan Records#Labels licensed to Trojan|Receiver Records]] as ''[[Skinhead Girl]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Conquering Ruler]]'' in 2001.

===The Specials reunion (2008-present)===
====Terry Hall & Friends====
In 2007, Hall teamed up with Golding for the first time in 24 years, to play Specials songs at two music festivals. At [[Glastonbury Festival]], they appeared on the Pyramid Stage with [[Lily Allen]] to perform "Gangsters". In May 2009, Golding claimed that Allen's reuniting him with Hall played a "massive part" in the group's later reformation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.coventrytelegraph.net/passtheremote/2009/05/the-specials-reunuion-all-down.html |title=The Specials reunion all down to Lily Allen |work=Coventry Telegraph |date=15 May 2009 |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> Later the same day, they played on the Park Stage, with [[Damon Albarn]] of [[Blur (band)|Blur]] on piano and [[beatbox]]er [[Shlomo (human beatbox)|Shlomo]] providing rhythm, to perform "A Message to You, Rudy". At [[GuilFest]], Golding joined the Dub Pistols to again perform "Gangsters". In 2007, Golding regularly performed concerts and recorded with [[Pama International]], a collective of musicians who were members of Special Beat.

[[File:The Special Concert.jpg|thumb|300px|The Specials performing at [[Brixton Academy]], London, May 2009 as part of their 30th anniversary tour]]
On 30 March 2008, Hall stated that the Specials would be reforming for tour dates in autumn 2008, and possibly for some recording.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/news/20080330_specials.shtml |title=6 Music – The Specials reunion |publisher=BBC |date=30 March 2008 |access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> This was officially confirmed on 7 April 2008.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/coventry_warwickshire/7335284.stm |title=Ska band confirms reunion plans |publisher=BBC News |date=7 April 2008 |access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> On 6 September 2008, six members of the band performed on the main stage at the [[Bestival]], billed as the "Surprise Act". By December 2008, the band had announced 2009 tour dates to celebrate their 30th anniversary, although founder member Dammers was not joining the band on the tour.

Hall was quoted as saying, "The door remains open to him".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-specials/41400 |title=The Specials reunite for 2009 tour |website=Nme.com |date=2 December 2008 |access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref> However, Dammers described the new reunion as a "takeover" and claimed he had been forced out of the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/00862-jerry-dammers-slams-specials-reunion|author=Turner, Luke |title=Jerry Dammers Damns Specials Reunion |website=Thequietus.com |date=10 December 2008 |access-date=29 April 2010}}</ref> Around that same time, longtime Specials fan [[Amy Winehouse]] joined Dammers onstage at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], singing the song he wrote for the Specials, "Free Nelson Mandela", for Mandela's 90th birthday concert, dubbed [[46664]] after Mandela's prison number, and also the name of his AIDS charity, which received money raised by the birthday bash.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/06/28/singer-amy-winehouse-takes-stage-at-nelson-mandela-birthday-show/#ixzz2PChMuuxC |title=London rocks for Nelson Mandela |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=28 June 2008 |access-date=23 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231085905/http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/06/28/singer-amy-winehouse-takes-stage-at-nelson-mandela-birthday-show/#ixzz2PChMuuxC#ixzz2PChMuuxC |archive-date=31 December 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/europe/06/28/mandela.concert/index.html |title=London rocks for Nelson Mandela |agency=[[CNN]] |date=28 June 2008 |access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref>

====30th Anniversary Tour and beyond====
On 10 April 2009, the Specials guested on [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''.

====Neville Staple leaves The Specials====
In January 2013, the Specials announced the departure of Staple with the following message on their website: "We are very sad Neville cannot join us on the Specials' UK tour in May 2013 or indeed on the future projects we have planned. He has made a huge contribution to the fantastic time and reception we have received since we started and reformed in 2009. However, he missed a number of key shows last year due to ill health, and his health is obviously much more important. We wish him the very best for the future".

The Specials completed a North American tour in 2013, performing to sold-out crowds in Chicago, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland and Vancouver.
