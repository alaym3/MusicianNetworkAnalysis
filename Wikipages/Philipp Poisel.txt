'''Philipp Poisel''' {{IPA|/pwaˈzɛl/}} (born 18 June 1983 in [[Ludwigsburg]]) is a German singer-songwriter.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and career beginnings ===
Philipp Poisel produced music since he was a child when he started to play drums and guitar. He recorded his composition with a tape recorder. He was in the choir but he was criticised so much for his singing that he gave up at the end.<ref name="www.motor.de">motor.de: ''[http://www.motor.de/kuenstler/philipp-poisel Philipp Poisel Künstlerseite]''</ref> After completing his [[Abitur]] exam, he wanted to be a secondary teacher of English, Art and Music. However, he was denied to higher education as he failed in the entrance examination in Music.<ref name="www.laut.de">laut.de: ''[http://www.laut.de/Philipp-Poisel laut.de-Biografie: Philipp Poisel]''</ref>

=== First studio album ===
After numerous trips throughout Europe, Poisel met his future producer Frank Pilsl, with whom he recorded first demo versions of his songs in summer 2006. Poisel also founded his own record label ''Holunder-Records'' as he couldn't reach an agreement for contract terms with any of the major labels. In 2007, the famous German musician [[Herbert Grönemeyer]] noticed Poisel and signed him to his record company [[Grönland]].<ref name="www.swr3.de">SWR3 Poplexikon: ''[http://www.swr3.de/musik/poplexikon/-/id=927882/did=373402/xnd5up/ Biografie: Poisel, Philipp]''</ref> On August 29, 2008, Poisel’s debut album Wo fängt dein Himmel an? was released. His eponymous first single, which was released a few weeks earlier than his debut, hit No. 77 in the German Single-Charts. Later the same year, Poisel performed in the opening act for [[Ane Brun]], [[Maria Mena]], [[Suzanne Vega]] and Herbert Grönemeyer.

=== Second studio album and commercial breakthrough ===
After a concert tour in the German speaking region, Poisel worked on the production of his second studio album ''Bis nach Toulouse''. It was released on August 27, 2010 and reached No. 8 of the German Album-Charts. It stayed Top 50 for eight weeks, making it a success surpassing his debut album.

In 2011, Poisel contributed his previously unreleased ballad ''Eiserner Steg'' to the soundtrack of the [[Matthias Schweighöfer]]-directed movie ''[[What a Man (2011 film)|What a Man]]'' which hit cinemas on August 26, 2011. The song was released as a single-track and climbed as high as No. 21 in the German Media Control-Charts at first. After it was performed by Benny Fiedler in the singing talent show ''[[The Voice of Germany]]'' in early January 2012, the song rose until mid-January 2012 from No. 100 to No. 4 of the German singles charts and hitherto his highest single-placement in the German [[Media Control-Charts]].<ref name="musikmarkt">{{cite web|url=http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Charts-Deutschland-KW-3-The-Voice-Kandidaten-entern-Single-Top-100-mit-Videos|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120905123905/http://www.musikmarkt.de/Aktuell/News/Charts-Deutschland-KW-3-The-Voice-Kandidaten-entern-Single-Top-100-mit-Videos|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-09-05|publisher=musikmarkt.de|title=Charts Deutschland KW 3: "The Voice"-Kandidaten entern Single Top &#124; Musikmarkt|accessdate=2016-12-13}}</ref>

In August 2012, Poisel published the live album ''Projekt Seerosenteich'' in which he interprets 19 of his songs with new string quartets and piano accompaniment. The album went straight to number one in the German Album-Charts.<ref>''[http://www.gfk-entertainment.com/news/philipp-poisel-siegt-in-album-charts.html Philipp Poisel siegt in Album-Charts]'' - Pressemeldung von media control am 28.August 2012</ref>

It stayed in the Top 10 of the German Singlecharts for five weeks.<ref>[http://www.chartsurfer.de/artist/max-herre-feat-philipp-poisel/wolke-7-song_grhgr.html Charthistorie von "Wolke 7"] auf chartsurfer.de; abgerufen am 19.Jan.2013</ref>

In September 2012, Poisel’s Single ''Wie soll ein Mensch das ertragen?'' jumped from No. 59 to No. 5 in the German Singlecharts after [[Jean-Michel Aweh]] performed the song in the talent show ''Das Supertalent''.<ref name="hna">{{cite web|url=http://www.hna.de/nachrichten/stadt-kassel/kassel/rtl-show-kasseler-machte-das-supertalent-furore-2509928.html|publisher=hna.de|title=Jean-Michel Aweh: Interview mit dem Kasseler "Supertalent" &#124; Kassel|accessdate=2016-12-13}}</ref>  The single also hit the Top Ten in Austria after Aweh’s performance.
