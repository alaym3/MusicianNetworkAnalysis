==Biography==
===Early life===
Kearney was born on December 1, 1978 and raised in [[Eugene, Oregon]], with his two brothers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.one21music.com/mat-kearney/ |title=Mat Kearney&#124; Singer, Songwriter&#124; Christian Music Artist &#124; |publisher=One21music.com |access-date=September 17, 2012}}</ref> At [[South Eugene High School]], Kearney was a soccer player.<ref name="rg">{{Cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mGhXAAAAIBAJ&pg=4359,7089389&dq=mat-kearney+south-eugene-high-school&hl=en |title=Hometown boy takes an unlikely path to Nashville |last=Lamberson |first=Carolyn |date=October 27, 2005 |work=[[Eugene Register-Guard]] |access-date=August 24, 2012}}</ref>

He attended [[Chico State|California State University, Chico]] in [[Chico, California]], on an athletic scholarship and majored in literature, playing soccer until his junior year. Kearney first became interested in music after traveling to [[Nashville]] with music producer Robert Marvin.<ref name="rg" /> Using a roommate's guitar, he tried covering songs by other artists, but realized he was not very good at it, and began writing his own. Though things were going well for Kearney at school, the partying atmosphere at Chico caught up to him. In an interview, Kearney said, "I guess I lived it up and did what everyone said you should do in college. I discovered the depth of depravity, the bleakness of that lifestyle. It just wasn't working. I finally started understanding there must be more to life."<ref name="CBN 1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/artists/kearney_mat.aspx |title=Mat Kearney |website=CBNmusic.com |access-date=August 11, 2011}}</ref>

Kearney began focusing on music fusing his simple guitar playing with spoken word or rap. He started to play at coffee shops and soon began to make small amounts of money. At this time, Kearney had met friend and future producer, Robert Marvin. The two began to make music together, but Marvin had plans to move to [[Nashville|Nashville, Tennessee]]. Marvin asked Kearney to help with the move and he accepted. Kearney says, "I helped him pack up his trailer and we put a mattress on the back of his truck. We basically drove cross-country and slept in the back. When we pulled into Nashville we slept in a school parking lot for three days until we finally rented this apartment where the roof was caving in and mice were crawling all over." Kearney decided to stay in Nashville to record a few demos with Marvin and after a few months, Kearney had no plans on returning. "By the end of the summer, we had three or four songs and I realized this is what I wanted to do. It just clicked. So I called home to Oregon and said, 'I'm not coming back' and I never left Nashville."<ref name="CBN 1" />

=== Recording career ===
On April 18, 2006, Kearney's second album and major-label debut, titled ''[[Nothing Left to Lose (Mat Kearney album)|Nothing Left to Lose]]'', was released. It contains several reworked songs from Kearney's first album ''[[Bullet (Mat Kearney album)|Bullet]]'', as well as some new material, and has sold over 450,000 copies to date.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} The title track "Nothing Left to Lose" was the first single from the album, peaking at No. 41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for the week of February 10, 2007. The single has sold over 500,000 copies and won numerous BMI awards.{{specify|date=June 2013}} The track "All I Need" was featured on ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'' and ''[[NCIS (TV series)|NCIS]]''.
