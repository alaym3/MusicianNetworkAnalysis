'''Yoko Ono''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|n|oʊ}} {{respell|OH|noh}}; {{lang-ja|小野 洋子|Ono Yōko}}, <small>usually spelled in [[katakana]]</small> {{lang|ja|オノ・ヨーコ}}; born February 18, 1933) is a Japanese [[multimedia]] artist, singer, songwriter and [[peace activist]]. Her work also encompasses [[performance art]], which she performs in both English and Japanese, and filmmaking.<ref name="my.entertainment.yahoo.com">{{cite news|url=http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|title=Yoko Ono retrospective opens in Frankfurt|date=February 16, 2013|publisher=Yahoo Malaysia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912052307/http://my.entertainment.yahoo.com/news/yoko-ono-retrospective-opens-frankfurt-164740038.html|archive-date=September 12, 2013|access-date=February 16, 2013}}</ref>

Ono grew up in Tokyo and moved to [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1953 with her family. She became involved in New York City's downtown artists scene, which included the [[Fluxus]] group. She came to international notoriety in 1969 when she married British singer-songwriter [[John Lennon]] of [[the Beatles]], with the couple using their [[Bed-Ins for Peace|honeymoon]] as a stage for public [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. She and Lennon remained married until he was [[Murder of John Lennon|murdered]] in front of the couple's apartment building in December 1980. Together they had one son, [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], who later also became a musician.

Ono began a career in popular music in 1969, forming [[the Plastic Ono Band]] with Lennon and producing a number of avant-garde music albums in the 1970s. She achieved commercial and critical acclaim in 1980 with the chart-topping album ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', a collaboration with Lennon that was released three weeks before his murder, winning the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]]. To date, she has had twelve number one singles on the US Dance charts, and in 2016 was named the 11th most successful dance club artist of all time by [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] magazine.<ref name=":1">{{cite magazine|title=Greatest of All Time Top Dance Club Artists : Page 1|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707003540/http://www.billboard.com/charts/greatest-top-dance-club-artists|archive-date=July 7, 2017}}</ref> Many musicians have paid tribute to Ono as an artist in her own right and as a [[muse]] and [[cultural icon|icon]], including [[Elvis Costello]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Elvis Costello-Walking on Thin Ice|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309053759/http://www.last.fm/music/Elvis+Costello/_/Walking+On+Thin+Ice|archive-date=March 9, 2016|access-date=February 7, 2014|publisher=last.fm}}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2021|reason="Proves he covered song recorded with John Lennon, not that he has paid tribute to her as a cultural icon}} [[The B-52's]],<ref name="allmusic" /> [[Sonic Youth]]<ref name="NME">{{cite news|date=December 1, 1999|title=SYR4 – Goodbye 20th Century|website=NME|url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223061001/http://www.nme.com/reviews/artistKeyname/1664|archive-date=February 23, 2014}}</ref> and [[Meredith Monk]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meredith Monk: Songs That Defy Time and Country {{!}} New Sounds {{!}} Hand-picked music, genre free|url=https://www.newsounds.org/story/meredith-monk-portal/|access-date=2021-11-07|website=newsounds|language=en}}</ref>

==Biography==

=== Early life and family ===
Ono was born on February 18, 1933, in [[Tokyo City]], to {{nihongo|Isoko Ono|小野 磯子|Ono Isoko}} and {{nihongo|Eisuke Ono|小野 英輔|Ono Eisuke}}, a wealthy banker and former [[classical pianist]].<ref name="allmusicB">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|title=Yoko Ono: biography|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130101749/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-mn0000521704/biography|archive-date=January 30, 2014}}</ref> Isoko's maternal grandfather {{nihongo|[[Zenjiro Yasuda]]|安田 善次郎|Yasuda Zenjirō}} was an affiliate of the [[Yasuda clan]] and [[Yasuda zaibatsu|zaibatsu]]. Eisuke came from a long line of [[samurai]] warrior-scholars.<ref name="Stan" /> The [[kanji]] translation of [[Yoko (name)|''Yōko'']] ({{lang|ja|洋子}}) means "ocean child".<ref name="allmusicB" /><ref name="nme" /> Two weeks before Ono's birth, Eisuke was transferred to San Francisco by his employer, the [[Yokohama Specie Bank]].<ref name="sayle" /> The rest of the family followed soon after, with Ono first meeting her father when she was two years old.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|title=Yoko Ono – Charts & Awards – Billboard Singles|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yoko-ono-p19685/charts-awards/billboard-singles|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=January 12, 2014}}</ref> Her younger brother Keisuke was born in December 1936.

Ono was enrolled in [[piano lesson]]s from the age of 4, until the age of 12 or 13.<ref name="MH231">{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=231}}</ref> She attended [[kabuki]] performances with her mother, who was trained in [[shamisen]], [[koto (instrument)|koto]], [[otsuzumi]], [[kotsuzumi]], [[nagauta]], and could read Japanese musical scores. In 1937, the family was transferred back to Japan, and Ono enrolled at Tokyo's elite [[Gakushūin]] (also known as the Peers School), one of the most exclusive schools in Japan.<ref name="sayle" />

The family moved to New York City in 1940. The next year, Eisuke was transferred from New York City to [[Hanoi]], and the family returned to Japan. Ono was enrolled in Keimei Gakuen, an exclusive Christian primary school run by the [[Mitsui]] family. She remained in Tokyo throughout [[World War II]] and the great [[Bombing of Tokyo (10 March 1945)|fire-bombing of March 9, 1945]], during which she was sheltered with other family members in a special [[bunker]] in Tokyo's [[Azabu]] district, away from the heavy bombing. Ono later went to the [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]] [[mountain resort]] with members of her family.<ref name="sayle"/>

Starvation was rampant in the destruction that followed the Tokyo bombings; the Ono family was forced to beg for food while pulling their belongings in a wheelbarrow. Ono said it was during this period in her life that she developed her "aggressive" attitude and understanding of "outsider" status. Other stories tell of her mother bringing a large number of goods to the countryside, where they were [[barter]]ed for food. In one anecdote, her mother traded a German-made [[sewing machine]] for {{convert|60|kg}} of rice to feed the family.<ref name="sayle"/> During this time, Ono's father, who had been in Hanoi, was believed to be in a [[POW camp|prisoner of war camp]] in China. Ono told [[Amy Goodman]] of ''[[Democracy Now!]]'' on October 16, 2007, that "He was in [[French Indochina]], which is Vietnam actually.... in Saigon. He was in a concentration camp."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|title=EXCLUSIVE: Yoko Ono on the New Imagine Peace Tower in Iceland, Art & Politics, the Peace Movement, Government Surveillance and the Murder of John Lennon|last=Goodman|first=Amy|date=October 16, 2007|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|access-date=February 25, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222184454/http://www.democracynow.org/2007/10/16/exclusive_yoko_ono_on_the_new|archive-date=February 22, 2014}}</ref>

After the war ended in 1945, Ono remained in Japan when her family moved to the United States and settled in [[Scarsdale, New York]], an affluent town {{convert|25|mi}} north of [[midtown Manhattan]]. By April 1946, Gakushūin was reopened and Ono re-enrolled. The school, located near the [[Kōkyo|Tokyo Imperial Palace]], had not been damaged by the war, and Ono found herself a classmate of [[Akihito|Prince Akihito]], the future [[emperor of Japan]].<ref name="allmusicB"/><ref name=Stan/> At 14 years old, she took up vocal training in [[lieder]]-singing.

=== College and downtown beginnings ===
Ono graduated from Gakushūin in 1951, and was accepted into the philosophy program of [[Gakushuin University]] as the first woman to enter the department. However, she left the school after two semesters.<ref name="sayle">Murray Sayle, [http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op18.html "The Importance of Yoko Ono"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221150020/http://www.jpri.org/publications/occasionalpapers/op18.html |date=December 21, 2007 }}, JPRI Occasional Paper No. 18, Japan Policy Research Institute, November 2000.</ref>

Ono joined her family in New York in September 1952,<ref>"New York, New York Passenger and Crew Lists, 1909, 1925-1957," database with images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:2HMN-WZL : March 2, 2021), Yoko Ono, 1952; citing Immigration, New York City, New York, United States, NARA microfilm publication T715 (Washington, D.C.: National Archives and Records Administration, n.d.).</ref> and enrolled at nearby [[Sarah Lawrence College]]. Ono's parents approved of her college choice, but disapproved of her lifestyle and chastised her for befriending people whom they felt were beneath her. In  1956, Ono left college to [[elope]] with Japanese composer [[Toshi Ichiyanagi]],<ref name="Stan" /><ref name="BioA">{{cite news|title=Yoko Ono|publisher=biography.com|url=http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|url-status=live|access-date=February 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140216080529/http://www.biography.com/people/yoko-ono-9542162|archive-date=February 16, 2014}}</ref> a star in Tokyo's experimental community, then studying at Juilliard.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Farago|first=Jason|date=2015-06-25|title=Hearing Yoko Ono All Over Again|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/28/arts/music/hearing-yoko-ono-all-over-again.html|access-date=2021-11-07|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

At Sarah Lawrence, she studied poetry with [[Alastair Reid]], [[English literature]] with Kathryn Mansell, and music composition with the [[Vienna|Viennese]]-trained André Singer.<ref name="MH231" /> Ono has said that her heroes at this time were the [[twelve tone technique|twelve-tone composers]] [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and [[Alban Berg]]. She said, "I was just fascinated with what they could do. I wrote some twelve-tone songs, then my music went into [an] area that my teacher felt was really a bit off track, and..... he said, 'Well, look, there are people who are doing things like what you do and they're called avant-garde.'" Singer introduced her to the work of [[Edgar Varèse]], [[John Cage]], and [[Henry Cowell]]. Ono left college and moved to New York in 1957, supporting herself through secretarial work and lessons in the traditional Japanese arts at the [[Japan Society (Manhattan)|Japan Society]].<ref name="MH232">{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=232}}</ref>

Ono has often been associated with the [[Fluxus]] group, a loose association of [[Dada]]-inspired [[avant-garde]] artists which was founded in the early 1960s by Lithuanian-American artist [[George Maciunas]]. Maciunas admired and enthusiastically promoted her work, and gave Ono her first solo exhibition at his AG Gallery in New York in 1961. He formally invited Ono to join Fluxus, but she declined because she wanted to remain independent.<ref>{{cite news|last=Newhall|first=Edith|date=October 2000|title=A Long and Winding Road|page=163|work=ARTnews}}</ref> However, she did collaborate with Maciunas,{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=40-41}} [[Charlotte Moorman]], [[George Brecht]], and the poet [[Jackson Mac Low]], among others associated with the group.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

[[File:112 Chambers St jeh.jpg|thumb|112 Chambers Street, the location of Ono's 1960s loft where [[Fluxus]] events took place.]]

Ono first met John Cage through his student Ichiyanagi Toshi, in Cage's experimental composition class at the [[New School for Social Research]]:{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} She was introduced to more of Cage's unconventional [[neo-Dada]]ism first hand, and via his New York City protégés [[Allan Kaprow]], Brecht, Mac Low, [[Al Hansen]] and the poet [[Dick Higgins]].{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}}

After Cage finished teaching at the New School in the summer of 1960, Ono was determined to rent a place to present her works along with the work of other avant-garde artists in the city. She eventually found an inexpensive loft in downtown [[Manhattan]] at 112 [[Chambers Street (Manhattan)|Chambers Street]] and used the apartment as a studio and living space, also allowing composer [[La Monte Young]] to organize concerts in the loft.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=233}} They both held a series of events there from December 1960 through June 1961;<ref name="MH232" /> the events were attended by people such as [[Marcel Duchamp]] and [[Peggy Guggenheim]].<ref name="MH21">{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=21}}</ref> Ono and Young both claimed to have been the primary curator of these events,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kotz|first=Liz|author-link=Liz Kotz|date=Winter 2001|title=Post-Cagean Aesthetics and the "Event" Score|journal=October|volume=95|pages=55–89 [56]|jstor=779200}}</ref> with Ono claiming to have been eventually pushed into a subsidiary role by Young.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=65}} Ono only presented work once during the series.<ref name="MH232" />

In 1961, years before meeting Lennon, Ono had her first major public performance in a concert at the 258-seat [[Carnegie Hall|Carnegie Recital Hall]] (smaller than the "Main Hall"). This concert featured radical experimental music and performances.

The Chambers Street series hosted some of Ono's earliest conceptual artwork, including ''Painting to Be Stepped On'', a scrap of canvas on the floor that became a completed artwork upon the accrual of footprints. With that work, Ono suggested that a work of art no longer needed to be mounted on a wall and inaccessible. She showed this work and other instructional work again at Macunias's AG Gallery in July 1961.<ref name="MH21" /> After Ono set a painting on fire at one performance, Cage advised her to treat the paper with [[flame retardant]].<ref name="Stan">{{cite web|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|title=Yoko Ono to speak at Stanford, Stanford Report|last=Haven|first=Cynthia|date=December 19, 2008|publisher=Stanford University|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112012256/http://news.stanford.edu/news/2009/january7/yoko-010709.html|archive-date=November 12, 2013}}</ref> She is credited for the album cover art for the album ''Nirvana Symphony'' by [[Toshiro Mayuzumi]], released by Time Records in 1962.

After living apart for several years, Ono and Ichiyanagi filed for divorce in 1962. Ono returned home to live with her parents, and, suffering from [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]], was briefly placed into a Japanese [[mental institution]].<ref name="allmusicB" /><ref name="BioChannel">{{cite news|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|title=Yoko Ono Biography|publisher=Biography Channel (UK)|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213213142/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono.html|archive-date=December 13, 2013}}</ref>

=== Early career and motherhood ===
On November 28, 1962, Ono married [[Anthony Cox (producer)|Anthony Cox]], an American jazz musician, film producer, and art promoter who had been instrumental in securing her release from the mental institution.<ref name="Stan" /> Ono's second marriage was [[annullment|annulled]] on March 1, 1963, because she had neglected to finalize her divorce from Ichiyanagi. After finalizing that divorce, Cox and Ono married again on June 6, 1963. She gave birth to their daughter Kyoko Chan Cox two months later, on August 8, 1963.<ref name="allmusicB" />

The marriage quickly fell apart, but the Coxes stayed together for the sake of their joint careers. They performed at Tokyo's [[Sogetsu]] Hall, with Ono lying atop a piano played by John Cage. Soon, the couple returned to New York with Kyoko. In the early years of the marriage, Ono left most of Kyoko's parenting to Cox while she pursued her art full-time, with Cox also managing her publicity.

Ono had a second engagement at the Carnegie Recital Hall in 1965, in which she debuted ''Cut Piece''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ono, Yoko: Cut Piece|url=http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/cut-piece/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107032346/http://www.medienkunstnetz.de/works/cut-piece/|archive-date=November 7, 2017|access-date=November 5, 2017|publisher=Medien Kunst Netz (Media Art Net)}}</ref> In September 1966, Ono visited London to meet artist and political activist [[Gustav Metzger]]'s Destruction in Art Symposium in September 1966. She was the only woman artist chosen to perform her own events and only one of two invited to speak.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=168}} She premiered ''The Fog Machine'' during her ''Concert of Music for the Mind'' at the Bluecoat Society of Arts in Liverpool, England in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|title=Centre of the Creative Universe: Liverpool and the Avant-Garde: Timeline|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/centre-creative-universe-liverpool-and-avant-garde/centre|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302142908/http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/centre-creative-universe-liverpool-and-avant-garde/centre|archive-date=March 2, 2014|access-date=January 10, 2015|publisher=tate.or.uk}}</ref>

Ono and Cox divorced on February 2, 1969, and she married John Lennon later that same year. During a 1971 [[custody battle]], Cox disappeared with their eight-year-old daughter. He won custody after successfully claiming that Ono was an unfit mother due to her drug use.<ref name="BioChannel" /> Ono's ex-husband changed Kyoko's name to "Ruth Holman" and subsequently raised the girl in an organization known as the [[The Living Word Fellowship|Church of the Living Word]] (or "the Walk").<ref>{{cite book|last=Hockinson|first=Michael J.|title=The Ultimate Beatles Quiz Book|date=1992|publisher=Macmillan}}</ref> Ono and Lennon searched for Kyoko for years, but to no avail. She would finally see Kyoko again in 1998.<ref name="BioChannel" />

===Relationship with John Lennon===
[[File:John Lennon en echtgenote Yoko Ono vertrekken van Schiphol naar Wenen in de vert, Bestanddeelnr 922-2496 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Yoko Ono and John Lennon when they married, March 1969|alt=]]
Ono's first contact with any member of [[the Beatles]] occurred when she visited [[Paul McCartney]] at his home in London to obtain a Lennon–McCartney song manuscript for a book [[John Cage]] was working on, ''[[Notations]]''.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=246}} McCartney declined to give her any of his manuscripts but suggested that Lennon might oblige.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=246}} Lennon later gave Ono the original handwritten lyrics to "[[The Word (song)|The Word]]".{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=272}}

Ono and Lennon first met on November 9, 1966, at the [[Indica Gallery]] in London, where she was preparing her conceptual art exhibit, and they were introduced by gallery owner [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]].{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=682}} Lennon was initially unimpressed with the exhibits he saw, including a pricey bag of nails, but one piece, ''[[Ceiling Painting/Yes Painting]]'', had a ladder with a spyglass at the top. When he climbed the ladder, Lennon felt a little foolish, but he looked through the spyglass and saw the word "YES" which he said meant he didn't walk out, as it was positive, whereas most concept art he encountered was "anti" everything.<ref name=HSW>{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|title=John Lennon: John Lennon Meets Yoko Ono|last=Buskin|first=Richard|publisher=HowStuffWorks.com|access-date=April 17, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427092641/http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/john-lennon30.htm|archive-date=April 27, 2014}}</ref>

Lennon was also intrigued by Ono's ''Hammer a Nail''. Viewers hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet opened, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, "Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it." Ono supposedly had not heard of the Beatles, but relented on the condition that Lennon pay her five [[shilling (British coin)|shillings]], to which Lennon replied, "I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in."<ref name="HSW" /><ref>{{cite book|last=Sheff|first=David|title=All We Are Saying: The Last Major Interview with John Lennon and Yoko Ono|publisher=St. Martin's Griffin|year=2000}}</ref>

====Early collaborations, marriage and "Bed-Ins"====

During the final two years of the Beatles, Lennon and Ono created and attended public [[protests against the Vietnam War]]. They collaborated on a series of avant-garde recordings, beginning in 1968 with ''[[Unfinished Music No.1: Two Virgins]]'', which notoriously featured an untouched image of the two artists nude on the front cover. The same year, the couple contributed an experimental sound collage to [[The Beatles]]' self-titled "[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]" called "[[Revolution 9]]", with Ono contributing additional vocals to "[[Birthday (Beatles song)|Birthday]]",<ref>{{cite web|last=Gibron|first=Bill|date=December 21, 1968|title=An in-depth Look at the Songs on Side-Three|url=http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113003559/http://www.thewhitealbumproject.com/songs/side-three/|archive-date=January 13, 2014|access-date=February 1, 2014|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=The White Album Project}}</ref> and one lead vocal line on "[[The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill]]", marking the only occasion in a Beatles recording in which a woman sings lead vocals.<ref>Lewisohn, Mark, 2000, ''The Complete Beatles Chronicle'', London: Hamlyn, {{ISBN|978-0-600-60033-6}}, p. 284</ref>

On March 20, 1969, Lennon and Ono were married at the registry office in [[Gibraltar]] and spent their honeymoon in [[Amsterdam]], campaigning with a week-long [[Bed-In|Bed-In for Peace]]. They planned another Bed-In in the US, but were denied entry to the country.<ref>Kruse, Robert J.

During the Amsterdam Bed In press conference, Yoko also earned controversy in the Jewish community for claiming during the press conference that, "If I was a Jewish girl in Hitler’s day, I would approach him and become his girlfriend. After 10 days in bed, he would come to my way of thinking. This world needs communication.

Lennon changed his name by [[deed poll]] on April 22, 1969, switching out ''Winston'' for ''Ono'' as a middle name. Although he used the name John Ono Lennon after that, official documents referred to him as John Winston Ono Lennon, since he was not permitted to revoke a name given at birth.<ref>Coleman, Ray, ''Lennon: The Definitive Biography'', 1984b, p. 64</ref> The couple settled at [[Tittenhurst Park]] at [[Sunninghill, Berkshire]], in southeast England.<ref name="PNorman">Norman, Philip, John Lennon The Life, Hammersmith, England: Harper Collins, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-00-719741-5}}, p. 615 et seq</ref> When Ono was injured in a car accident, Lennon arranged for a king-sized bed to be brought to the recording studio as he worked on the Beatles' last recorded album, ''[[Abbey Road]]''.<ref>Emerick, Massey, 2006, pp. 279–80</ref>

====The Plastic Ono Band====
{{main|Plastic Ono Band|Live Peace in Toronto 1969}}

[[File:John Lennon performing Give Peace a Chance 1969.jpg|thumb|Lennon and Ono recording [[Give Peace a Chance]], at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]], Montreal, 1969]]
After "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", Lennon and Ono decided it would be better to form their own band to release their newer, more personally representative work, rather than release the material as the Beatles.<ref>[[Ian MacDonald|McDonald, Ian]], ''[[Revolution in the Head]]'', 3rd ed., Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-55652-733-3}}, 1556527330</ref> To this end they formed the [[Plastic Ono Band]], a name coined by Lennon after Ono's use of "plastic stands" for recording purposes. The name had earlier been attached to a sound and light installation conceived by Ono which had been installed in the [[Apple Corps|Apple]] press office. The installation consisted of four perspex columns, each representing a member of the Beatles, with one holding a tape recorder and amplifer, the second a closed-circuit TV and camera, the third a record player and amplifier, and the fourth a miniature light show and loud speaker.

In July 1969, Lennon's first solo single, "[[Give Peace a Chance]]" (backed by Ono's "Remember Love") was the first release to be credited to the Plastic Ono Band. It was followed in October by "[[Cold Turkey]]" (backed by Ono's "[[Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)|Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for a Hand in the Snow)]]"). The singles were followed in December by the group's first album, ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]'', which had been recorded live at the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] festival in September. This incarnation of the group also consisted of guitarist [[Eric Clapton]], bass player [[Klaus Voormann]], and drummer [[Alan White (Yes drummer)|Alan White]]. The first half of their performance consisted of rock standards. During the second half, Ono took to the microphone and performed two original feedback-driven compositions, "Don't Worry Kyoko" and "John John (Let's Hope For Peace)",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|last=Calkin|first=Graham|title=Live Peace in Toronto 1969|publisher=Jpgr.co.uk|access-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009190538/http://www.jpgr.co.uk/core2001.html|archive-date=October 9, 2014}}</ref><ref>Blaney, John (2005).

====''Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band'' and ''Fly''====
{{main|Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band|John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band|Fly (Yoko Ono album)}}
Ono released her first solo album, ''[[Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band]]'' in 1970, as a companion piece to Lennon's ''[[John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band]]''. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a photo of her leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's a photo of him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and [[free jazz]] techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included [[Ornette Coleman]], other renowned [[free jazz]] performers, and [[Ringo Starr]]. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence [[Meredith Monk]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|title=Women in Music: Trailblazing Female Singers, Songwriters and Musicians|publisher=makers.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203025326/http://www.makers.com/blog/women-music-trailblazing-female-singers-songwriters-and-musicians/6|archive-date=February 3, 2014}}</ref> and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise instead of words.

When Lennon was invited to play with [[Frank Zappa]] at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore]] (then the Filmore West) on June 5, 1971, Ono joined them.<ref>Liner notes to Disc 2, ''Sometime in New York City'' album.</ref> Later that year, she released ''[[Fly (Yoko Ono album)|Fly]]'', a double album. In it, she explored slightly more conventional [[psychedelic rock]] with tracks including "Midsummer New York" and "Mind Train", in addition to a number of Fluxus experiments. She also received minor airplay with the ballad "[[Mrs. Lennon]]". The track "[[Don't Worry Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)|Don't Worry, Kyoko (Mummy's Only Looking for Her Hand in the Snow)]]" was an ode to Ono's missing daughter,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Beatles: An illustrated record|page=83|year=1978|publisher=Harmony Books|isbn=0-517-53367-7|author1=Carr, R.|author2=Tyler, T.|name-list-style=amp}}</ref> and featured Eric Clapton on guitar. In 1971, while studying with [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] in [[Majorca]], Spain, Ono's ex-husband Anthony Cox accused Ono of abducting their daughter Kyoko from the kindergarten. They reached an out of court agreement and the charges were dismissed. Cox eventually moved away with Kyoko.<ref>''Kyoko'' (2018), documentary by Marcos Cabotá. Far Visuals.

Kyoko is also referenced in the first line of "[[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)|Happy Christmas (War Is Over)]]" when Yoko whispers "Happy Christmas, Kyoko", followed by Lennon whispering, "Happy Christmas, [[Julian Lennon|Julian]]."<ref>Jackson, Andrew Grant.

In a 2018 issue of ''[[Portland Magazine]]'', editor [[Colin Sargent|Colin W. Sargent]] writes of interviewing Yoko while she was visiting Portland, Maine, in 2005. She spoke of driving along the coast with Lennon and dreamed of buying a house in Maine. "We talked excitedly in the car. We were looking for a house on the water… We did examine the place! We kept driving north along the water until I don't really remember the name of the town. We went quite a ways up, actually, because it was so beautiful."<ref>Sargent, Colin W. "Imagine".

By December 1974, Lennon and Pang considered buying a house together, and he refused to accept Ono's phone calls. The next month, Lennon agreed to meet with Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, Lennon failed to return home or call Pang. When she telephoned the next day, Ono told her Lennon was unavailable, because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment with Pang; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. He told her his separation from Ono was now over, though Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress.{{sfn|Harry|2001|p=700-01}}

Ono and Lennon's son, [[Sean Lennon|Sean]], was born on October 9, 1975, Lennon's 35th birthday.

On the evening of December 8, 1980, Lennon and Ono were in the [[Record Plant|Record Plant Studio]] and working on Ono's song "[[Walking on Thin Ice]]". When they returned to The Dakota (their home in Manhattan), Lennon was [[Murder of John Lennon|shot dead]] by [[Mark David Chapman]], a fan who had been stalking Lennon for two months. "Walking on Thin Ice (For John)" was released as a single less than a month later, and became Ono's first chart success, peaking at No. 58 and gaining significant underground airplay.

In 1981, she released the album ''[[Season of Glass (album)|Season of Glass]]'', which featured the striking cover photo of Lennon's bloody spectacles next to a half-filled glass of water, with a window overlooking Central Park in the background. This photograph sold at an auction in London in April 2002 for about $13,000. In the [[liner notes]] to ''Season of Glass'', Ono explained that the album was not dedicated to Lennon because "he would have been offended—he was one of us."

Ono funded the construction and maintenance of the [[Strawberry Fields memorial]] in Manhattan's [[Central Park]], directly across from the [[The Dakota|Dakota Apartments]], which was the scene of the murder and remains Ono's residence to this day. It was officially dedicated on October 9, 1985, which would have been his 45th birthday.

Ono's final album of the 1980s was ''[[Starpeace]]'', a [[concept album]] that she intended as an antidote to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s "[[Strategic Defense Initiative|Star Wars]]" [[National missile defense|missile defense system]]. On the cover, a warm, smiling Ono holds the Earth in the palm of her hand. ''Starpeace'' became Ono's most successful non-Lennon effort. The single "[[Hell in Paradise]]" was a hit, reaching No. 16 on the US dance charts and No. 26 on the [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]] Hot 100, and the video, directed by [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]] received major airplay on MTV and won "Most Innovative Video" at Billboard Music Video Awards in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|title=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI::FILM AND VIDEO AWARD|url=http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723194533/http://www.zbigvision.com/zbigsawards.html|archive-date=July 23, 2011|access-date=July 26, 2011|work=ZBIG RYBCZYNSKI}}</ref>

=== Resurgence and collaborations ===
In 1990, Ono collaborated with music consultant [[Jeff Pollack (Media Consultant)|Jeff Pollack]] to honor what would have been Lennon's 50th birthday with a worldwide broadcast of "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]". Over 1,000 stations in over 50 countries participated in the simultaneous broadcast.

Beginning in 2003, some DJs [[remix]]ed other Ono songs for dance clubs. For the remix project, she dropped her first name and became known simply as "ONO", in response to the "Oh, no!" jokes that dogged her throughout her career.

===''Cut Piece'', 1964===
Ono was a pioneer of [[conceptual art]] and performance art. A seminal performance work is ''[[Cut Piece 1964|Cut Piece]]'', first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto, Japan. The piece consisted of Ono, dressed in her best suit, kneeling on a stage with a pair of scissors in front of her. She invited and then instructed audience members to join her on stage and cut pieces of her clothing off. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref name=MH158>{{harvnb|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=158}}</ref> The piece was subsequently performed at the Sogetsu Art Centre in Tokyo that same year, New York's [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965 and London's [[Africa Centre, London|Africa Center]] as part of the [[Destruction in Art Symposium]] in 1966.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Phelan|first1=Peggy|editor1-last=Butler|editor1-first=Cornelia|editor1-link=WACK!: Art and the Feminist Revolution|title=The Returns of Touch: Feminist Performances, 1960–80|date=2007|publisher=Museum of Contemporary Art|location=Los Angeles|page=350}}</ref> Of the piece, John Hendricks wrote in the catalogue to Ono's Japan Society retrospective: "[''Cut Piece''] unveils the interpersonal alienation that characterizes social relationships between subjects, dismantling the disinterested Kantian aesthetic model{{nbsp}}...

===''Grapefruit'' book, 1964===
{{main|Grapefruit (book)}}

Ono's small book titled ''[[Grapefruit (book)|Grapefruit]]'' is another seminal piece of conceptual art. First published in 1964, the book reads as a set of instructions through which the work of art is completed-either literally or in the imagination of the viewer participant. One example is "Hide and Seek Piece: Hide until everybody goes home. Hide until everybody forgets about you. Hide until everybody dies." ''Grapefruit'' has been published several times, most widely distributed by [[Simon & Schuster]] in 1971, who reprinted it again in 2000. {{ill|David Bourdon|de}}, art critic for ''[[The Village Voice]]'' and ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'', called ''Grapefruit'' "one of the monuments of conceptual art of the early 1960s". He noted that her conceptual approach was made more acceptable when white male artists like [[Joseph Kosuth]] and [[Lawrence Weiner]] came in and "did virtually the same things" she did, and that her take also has a poetic and lyrical side that sets it apart from the work of other conceptual artists.<ref name=Whit/>

Ono would enact many of the book's scenarios as performance pieces throughout her career, which formed the basis for her art exhibitions, including the highly publicized [[retrospective exhibition]], ''This Is Not Here'' in 1971 at the [[Everson Museum]] in [[Syracuse, New York]],<ref name="Grove">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sPGdBxzaWj0C&q=596|title=The Grove Encyclopedia of American Art, Volume 1|publisher=Oxford University Press |editor=Joan M.

===Experimental films, 1964–72===
Ono was also an [[experimental filmmaker]] who made 16 short films between 1964 and 1972, gaining particular renown for a 1966 Fluxus film called simply ''No. 4'', often referred to as ''Bottoms''.{{sfn|''The Rare Films of Yoko Ono''|2004}}<ref name=BioB>{{cite news|title=Yoko Ono Biography: Films |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202100643/http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/yoko-ono/films.html|archive-date=February 2, 2014 |publisher=Biography Channel (UK)}}</ref> The five-and-a-half-minute film consists of a series of close-ups of human buttocks walking on a treadmill. The screen is divided into four almost equal sections by the elements of the [[gluteal cleft]] and the [[horizontal gluteal crease]]. The soundtrack consists of interviews with those who are being filmed, as well as those considering joining the project. In 1996, the watch manufacturing company [[Swatch]] produced a [[limited edition]] watch that commemorated this film.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/watches/finder-detail.sku-GB168.html|title=Film No. 4|publisher=swatch.com|access-date=February 5, 2014|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217183705/http://www.swatch.com/zz_en/watches/finder-detail.sku-GB168.html|archive-date=December 17, 2013}}</ref>

In March 2004, the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA London]], showed most of her films from this period in their exhibition ''The Rare Films of Yoko Ono''.{{sfn|''The Rare Films of Yoko Ono''|2004}} She also acted in an obscure [[exploitation film]] in 1965, ''Satan's Bed''.<ref name=BioB/>

{{main|Wish Tree (Yoko Ono art series)}}
[[File:Immagine & Poesia on Yoko Ono’s Wish Tree, MoMa 2.jpg|thumb|right|Contributions to Yoko Ono's ''Wish Tree'' at [[MoMA]], New York City]]

Another example of Ono's participatory art was her ''Wish Tree'' project, in which a tree native to the installation site is installed. Her 1996 ''Wish Piece'' had the following instructions:

:Make a wish
:Write it down on a piece of paper
:Fold it and tie it around a branch of a Wish Tree
:Ask your friends to do the same
:Keep wishing
:Until the branches are covered with wishes.{{sfn|Munroe|Ono|Hendricks|Altshuler|2000|p=294}}

=== ''Arising'', 2015 ===
In 2015, Ono created the piece ''Arising'' in [[Venice]]. As part of the exhibition ''Personal Structures'', organised by Global Art Affairs, the installation was on view from June 1 through November 24, 2013, at the [[European Cultural Centre]]'s [[Palazzo Bembo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|title=WM {{!}} whitehot magazine of contemporary art {{!}} June 2013: Yoko Ono: Arising a call for Women – the Whitehot Magazine Interview|website=Whitehotmagazine.com|access-date=July 11, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180113150417/https://whitehotmagazine.com/articles/call-women-whitehot-magazine-interview/2792|archive-date=January 13, 2018}}</ref> In this feminist work of art, female [[silicon]] bodies were burnt in the [[Venetian lagoon]], evoking the imagery of mythical [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenixes]]. When asked for the resemblance between the naming of her record ''Rising'' and this piece, Ono responded: "''Rising'' was telling all people that it is time for us to rise and fight for our rights. But in the process of fighting together, women are still being treated separately in an inhuman way. It weakens the power of men and women all together. I hope ''Arising'' will wake up Women Power, and make us, men and women, heal together."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nyartsmagazine.com/?p=15615|title=Sarah Gold and Karlyn De Jongh Talk with Yoko Ono – NY Arts Magazine|date=January 31, 2014|work=NY Arts Magazine|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref>

===''Refugee Boat'', 2019===
Participating in Lower Manhattan's River to River Festival in 2019, Ono presented her participatory installation ''Add Color (Refugee Boat)'' (1960/2019). The work comprises a white room with a white rowing boat in it, which were both covered by messages and drawings from members of the audience throughout the festival. Through the participatory nature of the work, the artist emphasised the need for solidarity and the history of immigrants and refugees in the United States. ''Refugee Boat'' belongs to Ono's ''Add Color Painting'' series, first enacted in 1960, which invites the audience to make marks over the designated objects, often white.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ocula.com/artists/yoko-ono/|title=Yoko Ono|last=Paik|first=Sherry|website=Ocula|date=June 2021}}</ref>

In 1989, the [[Whitney Museum]] held a [[retrospective]] of her work, ''Yoko Ono: Objects, Films'', marking Ono's reentry into the New York art world after a hiatus. At the suggestion of Ono's live-in companion at the time, interior decorator [[Sam Havadtoy]], she recast her old pieces in bronze after some initial reluctance. "I realized that for something to move me so much that I would cry, there's something there. There seemed like a shimmering air in the 60s when I made these pieces, and now the air is bronzified. Now it's the 80s, and bronze is very 80s in a way – solidity, commodity, all of that. For someone who went through the 60s revolution, there has of course been an incredible change. . . . I call the pieces petrified bronze. That freedom, all the hope and wishes are in some ways petrified."<ref name=Whit>{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Taylor|author-link=Paul Taylor (art critic) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|title=Yoko Ono's New Bronze Age at the Whitney|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 5, 1989|access-date=January 31, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113183517/http://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/05/arts/art-yoko-ono-s-new-bronze-age-at-the-whitney.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|archive-date=November 13, 2013}}</ref>

In January 2013, the 79-year-old Ono, along with Sean Lennon and [[Susan Sarandon]], took to rural Pennsylvania in a bus under the banner of the Artists Against Fracking group she and Sean created with [[Mark Ruffalo]] in August 2012 to protest against [[hydraulic fracturing]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/18/fracking-debate-ono-lennon-sarandon-tour|title=Fracking debate draws Yoko, Lennon and Sarandon to rural battlegrounds: Artists Against Fracking board bus for magical mystery tour of Pennsylvania as New York and New Jersey decisions draw near|last=Gabbatt|first=Adam|date=January 18, 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312154838/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/jan/18/fracking-debate-ono-lennon-sarandon-tour|archive-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> Other group members include [[Lady Gaga]] and [[Alec Baldwin]].<ref name=Int>{{cite magazine|url=https://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/fracking-2012-9/|title=Intelligencer: Fracklash|date=September 10, 2012|magazine=New York|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140414004717/http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/topic/fracking-2012-9/|archive-date=April 14, 2014}}</ref>

In 1987, Ono travelled to [[Moscow]] to participate in the "International Forum for a Nuclear-free World and for the Survival of Mankind". She also visited [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]], where she met with members of the local John Lennon memorial club. Among these members was [[Kolya Vasin]], who was considered the biggest Beatles fan in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-reading.club/chapter.php/3802/54/Bagir-Zade_-__Bitlz__-_navsegda!.html|title="Битлз" – продолжение истории - "Битлз" - навсегда!|website=E-reading.club}}</ref><ref>[https://www.golos-ameriki.ru/a/2998096.html К храму Любви, Мира и Музыки ведут песни Джона Леннона] (RU)</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45402514|title=Russia's biggest Beatles fan Vasin dies|date=September 3, 2018|work=BBC News}}</ref>

She received a [[Golden Lion Award]] for lifetime achievement from the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2009 and the 2012 [[Oskar Kokoschka]] Prize, Austria's highest award for applied contemporary art.

In January 2021 Ono was one of the founders of The Coda Collection, a service that launched in the U.S. via Amazon Prime Video Channels on February 18, 2021, the day Ono turned 88. The Coda Collection will feature a slew of music documentaries and concert films. Jim Spinello will run The Coda Channel. Yoko Ono added, “John Lennon was always on the cutting edge of music and culture. The Coda Collection will be a new way for fans to connect on a deeper level.”<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/yoko-ono-janie-hendrix-the-coda-collection-1120106/|title=Yoko Ono, Janie Hendrix Launch the Coda Collection Music Channel|first1=Althea|last1=Legaspi|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=January 28, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/yoko-ono-and-janie-hendrix-help-launch-new-music-channel-coda-collection-2866765|title=Yoko Ono and Janie Hendrix help launch new music channel Coda Collection|website=[[NME]]|date=January 28, 2021}}</ref>

==Public image==
For many years, Ono was frequently criticized by both the press and the public. She was blamed for the breakup of the Beatles{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=40}}<ref name="Dub" /> and repeatedly criticized for her influence over Lennon and his music.<ref name="allmusicB" /> Her experimental art was also not popularly accepted.<ref name="allmusic" /> The British press was particularly negative and prompted the couple's move to the US.<ref name="TA" /> As late as December 1999, ''[[NME]]'' was calling her a "no-talent charlatan".<ref name="NME" />

Her name connoted the figure of the evil female interloper to the mainstream. In the 1978 [[Rutles]] [[mockumentary]] ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'', which parodied the lives of the Beatles, the Ono-esque character is portrayed as a Nazi officer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=THE RUTLES – Poffy's Movie Mania|url=https://www.poffysmoviemania.com/rutles/|website=Poffysmoviemania.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Gary Weis Film Director & Fisherman|url=http://www.garyweis.com/rut/rutles.html|website=Garyweis.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=St. Pat's Day at the Egyptian with the Rutles – John Varley|url=https://varley.net/nonfiction/hollyweird/st-pats-day-at-the-egyptian-with-the-rutles/|website=Varley.net}}</ref> [[Courtney Love]], [[Kurt Cobain]]'s widow, has been compared to Ono for her supposed bothersome role in [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s businesses and being blamed for Cobain's suicide.<ref name="Jackson, Buzzy 264–65">{{cite book|author=Jackson, Buzzy|url=https://archive.org/details/badwomanfeelingg00buzz|title=A Bad Woman Feeling Good: Blues and the Women Who Sing Them|date=February 17, 2005|publisher=W.

When American singer [[Jessica Simpson]] was dating [[Dallas Cowboys]] quarterback [[Tony Romo]] in 2007, the Simpson-Romo relationship was blamed for Romo's poor performances. In response, some Cowboys' fans gave her the moniker "Yoko Romo".<ref name="Dahlberg">{{cite news|last=Dahlberg|first=Tim|date=December 22, 2007|title=Yoko Romo: Jessica Simpson cast in the role of villain|work=USA Today|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-12-22-946446995_x.htm|url-status=live|access-date=August 7, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081029172215/http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-12-22-946446995_x.htm|archive-date=October 29, 2008}}</ref>

''Ono'' is still sometimes used to allude to the figure of the evil female interloper. In March 2015, [[Perrie Edwards]], member of English girl group [[Little Mix]], was compared to Yoko Ono and criticised for being the supposed reason for [[Zayn Malik (musician)|Zayn Malik]]'s departure from the British boy band [[One Direction]], creating tension within the group and causing widespread controversy.<ref>{{cite news|date=March 26, 2015|title=Perrie Edwards: The Blonde Yoko Ono?|publisher=MTV|url=http://www.mtv.com.au/one-direction/news/perrie-edwards-the-blonde-yoko-ono|access-date=March 26, 2015}}{{dead link|date=December 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

===Relationship with the Beatles===
{{main|Break-up of the Beatles}}
Lennon and Ono were injured in a car accident in June 1969, partway through recording ''[[Abbey Road]]''. According to journalist [[Barry Miles]], a bed with a microphone was then installed in the studio so that Ono could make artistic comments about the album.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=552}} Miles thought Ono's continual presence in the studio during the latter part of the Beatles' career put strain on Lennon's relationship with the other band members. [[George Harrison]] got into a shouting match with Lennon after Ono took one of his chocolate digestive biscuits without asking.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/08/reviews/001008.08udovitt.html|title=Let Us Now Praise Famous Men|newspaper=The New York Times|first=Mim|last=Udovitch|date=October 8, 2000|access-date=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140310222925/http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/10/08/reviews/001008.08udovitt.html|archive-date=March 10, 2014}}</ref>

The English press dubbed Ono "the woman who broke up the Beatles",{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=40}} which had been foreseen by [[Paul McCartney]] in 1969 during the group's rehearsals for their film and album ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'', when he said "It's going to be such an incredible sort of comical thing, like, in fifty years' time, you know: 'They broke up 'cause Yoko sat on an amp.'"<ref name=":0" /> In an interview with [[Dick Cavett]], Lennon explicitly denied that Ono broke up the Beatles,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IALrFZTS1yM|title=John Lennon-on Yoko Breaking Up the Beatles|via=[[YouTube]]|date=January 11, 2008|access-date=August 24, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151112025120/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IALrFZTS1yM|archive-date=November 12, 2015}}</ref> and Harrison said during an interview with Cavett that the problems within the group began long before Ono came onto the scene.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vP84g-yn58|title=George harrison talks about Lennon, Paul, yoko ono and beatles beakup|via=[[YouTube]]|date=December 5, 1990|access-date=August 24, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160328214448/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vP84g-yn58|archive-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref> Ono herself has said that the Beatles broke up without any direct involvement from her, adding "I don't think I could have tried even to break them up."{{sfn|Badman|1999|p=41}}

While the Beatles were together, every song written by Lennon or McCartney was credited as [[Lennon–McCartney]] regardless of whether the song was a [[collaboration]] or written solely by one of the two (except for those appearing on their first album, ''Please Please Me'', which originally credited the songs to McCartney–Lennon). In 1976, McCartney released a live album called ''[[Wings over America]]'', which credited the five Beatles tracks as P. McCartney–J. Lennon compositions, but neither Lennon nor Ono objected. After Lennon's death, however, McCartney again attempted to change the order to McCartney–Lennon for songs that were solely or predominantly written by him, such as "[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]]",<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|title=Talking Point &#124; Lennon-McCartney: Who do you give credit to?|work=BBC News|date=December 23, 2002|access-date=April 18, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407163230/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2588861.stm|archive-date=April 7, 2012}}</ref>{{clarify|date=August 2020|reason=unclear referent; primarily written by Lennon or McCartney?}} but Ono would not allow it, saying she felt this broke an agreement that the two had made while Lennon was still alive, and the surviving Beatle argued that such an agreement never existed. A spokesman for Ono said McCartney was making "an attempt to rewrite history".<ref name="billboard_controversy"/>

In a ''Rolling Stone'' interview in 1987, Ono pointed out McCartney's place in the disintegration of the band.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|title=Yoko Ono Blames Paul McCartney for the Beatles' Breakup?|last=Vultaggio|first=Maria|date=December 29, 2012|newspaper=[[International Business Times]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231180229/http://www.ibtimes.com/yoko-ono-blames-paul-mccartney-beatles-breakup-979558|archive-date=December 31, 2012}}</ref> On the 1998 John Lennon anthology, ''[[Lennon Legend]]'', the composer credit of "Give Peace a Chance" was changed to "John Lennon" from its original composing credit of "Lennon–McCartney". Although Lennon wrote the song during his tenure with the Beatles, it was both written and recorded without the help of the band, and released as Lennon's first independent single under the "Plastic Ono Band" moniker. Lennon subsequently expressed regret that he had not given co-writing credit to Ono instead, who actually helped him write the song.<ref name=PN/> In 2002, McCartney released another live album, ''[[Back in the U.S.|Back in the U.S. Live 2002]]'', and the 19 Beatles songs included are described as "composed by Paul McCartney and John Lennon", which reignited the debate over credits with Ono. Her spokesperson Elliott Mintz called it "an attempt to rewrite history". Nevertheless, Ono did not sue.<ref name="billboard_controversy">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|title=Update: McCartney Reignites Beatles Credit Controversy|magazine=Billboard|access-date=February 14, 2014|url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141004204132/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/73102/update-mccartney-reignites-beatles-credit-controversy|archive-date=October 4, 2014}}</ref>

In 1995, after the Beatles released Lennon's "[[Free as a Bird]]" and "[[Real Love (John Lennon song)|Real Love]]", with demos provided by Ono, McCartney and his family collaborated with her and Sean to create the song "Hiroshima Sky is Always Blue", which commemorates the 50th anniversary of the [[Hiroshima Massacre|atomic bombing of that Japanese city]]. Of Ono, McCartney stated: "I thought she was a cold woman. I think that's wrong..... she's just the opposite..... I think she's just more determined than most people to be herself." Two years later, however, Ono publicly compared Lennon to [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], while McCartney, she said, more closely resembled his less-talented rival [[Antonio Salieri]].<ref>Garcia, Gilbert.

Accepting an award at the 2005 [[Q Awards]], Ono mentioned that Lennon had once felt insecure about his songwriting. She had responded, "You're a good songwriter. It's not June with spoon that you write. You're a good singer, and most musicians are probably a little bit nervous about covering your songs."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|location=London|title=Yoko Ono claims she was misquoted over McCartney outburst|first=Ian|last=Herbert|date=October 15, 2005|access-date=February 1, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140225032027/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/yoko-ono-claims-she-was-misquoted-over-mccartney-outburst-319727.html?origin=internalSearch|archive-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref>

In an October 2010 interview, Ono spoke about Lennon's "lost weekend" and her subsequent reconciliation with him. She credited McCartney with helping save her marriage to John.

===Relationship with Julian Lennon===
{{main|John Lennon#Julian Lennon}}
Ono had a difficult relationship with her stepson [[Julian Lennon|Julian]], but the relationship has improved over the years. He has expressed disappointment at her handling of Lennon's estate, and at the difference between his upbringing and Sean's, adding, "when Dad gave up music for a couple of years to be with Sean, why couldn't he do that with me?"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|title=Julian Lennon blames father John for his lack of children|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 4, 2011|access-date=February 21, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327161916/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8933287/Julian-Lennon-blames-father-John-for-his-lack-of-children.html|archive-date=March 27, 2014}}</ref> Julian was left out of his father's will, and he battled Ono in court for years, settling in 1996 for an unspecified amount that the media reported was "believed to" be in the area of £20&nbsp;million, which Julian has denied.<ref name=Scot/>

He has said that he is his "mother's boy", which Ono has cited as the reason why she was never able to get close to him: "Julian and I tried to be friends. Of course, if he's too friendly with me, then I think that it hurts his other relatives. He was very loyal to his mother. That was the first thing that was in his mind."<ref name=yahoo1/> Nevertheless, she and Sean attended the opening of Julian's photo exhibition at the [[Morrison Hotel#Album cover|Morrison Hotel]] in New York City in 2010,<ref name="Rolling Stone"/> appearing for the first time for photos with Cynthia and Julian.<ref name=yahoo1/> She also promoted the exhibition on her website, and Julian and Sean are close.<ref name="Imagine Peace"/>

===In art and popular culture===

[[Mary Beth Edelson]]'s ''Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper'' (1972) appropriated [[Leonardo da Vinci]]’s ''The Last Supper'', with the heads of notable women artists collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles; Ono was among those notable women artists.
