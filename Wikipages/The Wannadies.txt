'''The Wannadies''' are an [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1988 in [[Skellefteå]], northern [[Sweden]].<ref name="Homepage">[https://web.archive.org/web/20180806210823/https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=thewannadies&e=com]</ref> The band's initial line-up featured Pär Wiksten (vocals, [[guitar]]s), Christina Bergmark (born 1 March 1963) ([[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]], vocals), Stefan Schönfeldt (born 5 June 1965) (guitars) and his younger brother Fredrik Schönfeldt ([[Bass guitar|bass]]) with Gunnar Karlsson ([[Drum kit|drums]]) and Björn Malmquist ([[violin]]).

==History==
===Early days (1988–1993)===
The Wannadies played their first [[concert]], a festival in support of the [[Nicaragua]]n [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]], in October 1988 and only weeks later entered local studio KN to record the three tracks that would become their debut release—the ''[[Smile (The Wannadies EP)|Smile EP]]''.

''Smile'' was released in February 1989 and managed to pick up several 'single of the week' accolades from national newspapers as well as airplay on indie radio shows such as 'Bommen' despite little or no marketing. Following the band's appearance at the [[Hultsfred Festival]] in August 1989, The Wannadies signed a [[recording contract]] with MNW Records, releasing their debut single, "My Hometown", in May the following year.

The band's eponymous [[The Wannadies (1990 album)|debut album]] was released in August 1990,<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=417/8}}</ref> and was supported by tours of [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Norway]]. A highlight for the group was 1991s Nordic music festival in [[Paris]] where they shared the bill with Finland's [[22 Pistepirkko]] and [[Iceland|Iceland's]] [[The Sugarcubes]].

Second album, ''[[Aquanautic]]'' was released in October 1992 on Snap Records, MNW's indie label.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Not without controversy the album saw [[music video|videos]] for the singles "Things That I Would Love to Have Undone" and "Cherry Man" banned by [[MTV]] the former for featuring a foam animal cadaver, the latter for the allusions to paedophilia in both the song's lyrics and video which featured a middle-aged man surrounded by young girls and boys.

In the summer of 1993 Björn Malmquist moved to [[Stockholm]] and left the band (he did make a contribution to The Wannadies next album however, playing violin on the track "Dreamy Wednesdays").

===''Be a Girl'' and UK success (1993–1996)===
Initial recording sessions for third album, ''[[Be a Girl]]'', proved unsuccessful—first choice producer Dagge Lunquist took paternity leave late in 1993 and a second attempt with producer Micke Herrström had to be abandoned after just a week and a half when, first engineer Adam Kviman, then Herrström were taken sick with hearing injuries.

"Love in June", the only song to be completed with Micke Herrström, was released as a single while the band tried again to record ''Be a Girl'', this time with producer Nille Perned. The album was finally finished by late 1994 and was released along with second single, "[[You and Me Song]]", to critical acclaim in their native country.<ref name="Larkin90"/> Shortly afterwards the band came to the attention of Indolent Records in the [[United Kingdom]] who signed The Wannadies in the summer of 1995.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The group's first British gig followed soon after, a sold-out show at the [[Dublin Castle, Camden]] in the autumn of the same year.

Throughout winter the band toured extensively with labelmates [[Sleeper (band)|Sleeper]] and [[60 Ft. Dolls|The 60&nbsp;ft Dolls]] as well as with [[Lightning Seeds]] and [[Black Francis|Frank Black]]. At the same time they were regularly commuting to studios in [[Gothenburg]], Skellefteå and Stockholm to record tracks for their next album, again with producer Nille Perned.

Further singles "Might Be Stars" and "How Does It Feel?" were taken from ''Be a Girl'' but it was not until the re-release of "You and Me Song" in April 1996 that the band really made an impact in the United Kingdom, where the song peaked at number eighteen on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> The track later appeared on the official [[soundtrack]] to [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s 1996 ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'', further increasing their popularity.

===Troubled times (1997–1999)===
Problems with Swedish record company MNW led to delays with the release of the group's fourth album, ''[[Bagsy Me]]'' (a translation of the Swedish children's expression 'Pax jag!'<ref name="Homepage"/>), which was eventually released in January 1997 on [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony/BMG Records]].<ref name="Larkin90"/> The album included the hit singles "Someone Somewhere", "Friends", "Hit" (which made No.&nbsp;20 in the UK Singles Chart) and "Shorty". "You and Me Song" was also included to capitalise on The Wannadies post-''Romeo + Juliet'' success. A revised version of the album (with two more singles from ''Be a Girl'' replacing two album tracks) was later released in America under the title ''[[The Wannadies (1997 album)|The Wannadies]]''.

The next few years were a turbulent time for the group. In Spring 1997 drummer and founding member Gunnar Karlsson left, to be replaced by Erik Dahlgren (born 25 August 1965), a long-term friend of the band.

After sorting out problems with their Swedish record label The Wannadies now felt they were suffering from a lack of support from BMG in the UK and went on strike. A [[compilation album]] of the best of their first three albums featuring tracks chosen by the band and entitled, appropriately, ''[[Skellefteå (album)|Skellefteå]]'', was released in Scandinavia in the spring of 1998 with the band touring the region in support while their problems with BMG were being resolved.

Relations with the label had sufficiently improved for the band to begin recording their next album in the autumn of 1998 with a ten-day session at the Chateau De La Rouge Motte studio in [[Normandy]], [[France]] with producer [[Mike Hedges]].

Only one track, "String Song", was completed however and it was not until the winter of 1998/99 that the band recorded the bulk of the tracks for fifth album ''[[Yeah (The Wannadies album)|Yeah]]''. With former [[The Cars|Cars]] frontman [[Ric Ocasek]] at the helm The Wannadies began recording at Electric Lady [[recording studio]]s in [[New York City]] and continued work at studios in Stockholm and London.

''Yeah'' was released in the autumn of 1999 in Scandinavia and early spring 2000 in the UK. BMG decided not to release the record in [[United States|America]] however, refused permission for the band to release it on another label and eventually dropped the band altogether.

===Recent times and break-up===
Despite not having a record company The Wannadies toured extensively throughout the summer of 2000, played the [[Glastonbury festival|Glastonbury]] and [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Carling]] festivals in the UK, [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] in [[Denmark]], Hultsfred and [[Arvika Festival|Arvika]] in Sweden and completed a mini-tour of [[Japan]].

The latter half of 2000 and much of 2001 saw the band construct their own [[recording studio]] in which they would record much of their sixth album.

With Nille Perned again producing, the band released ''[[Before & After (The Wannadies album)|Before & After]]'' in 2002 in Scandinavia through the [[National Records|National]] record label and on 8 September 2003 in the UK on [[Cooking Vinyl]] records (who also handled distribution for the rest of the world). The album featured the singles "Skin", "Disko" and "Little by Little".

In 2003, "You and Me Song" was used in the climax to an episode of ''[[Coronation Street]]'' in which [[Richard Hillman]] drives his new wife, [[Gail Platt]] and her family into a canal (in which he dies); and later, in 2007, an episode in which his stepson, [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]], drives his car into that same canal as a suicide attempt, only to survive, ruining his sister [[Sarah Platt|Sarah]]'s wedding day.

In 2006 "You and Me Song" was used as the theme song to the [[BBC Three]] TV series ''[[I'm With Stupid (UK TV series)|I'm with Stupid]]''.

The band were thought to be writing and recording songs for their seventh album, and are preparing to release a twenty track [[Greatest Hits|best of]],<ref name=Homepage/> however, in April 2009, they announced they had split with Pär Wiksten going solo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.culturedeluxe.com/news_item.asp?id=5857|title=Wow! - The Wannadies Have Split! (Culturedeluxe, 28 April 2009)|website=Culturedeluxe.com}}</ref>

On August 30 and September 2, 2016, after seven years apart, the band reunited and played their hits "Friends" and "Hit" at a festival.{{which|date=December 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vk.se/1800888/har-aterforenas-wannadies-efter-13-ar|title=Här återförenas Wannadies – efter 13 år|website=Vk.se|accessdate=22 December 2019}}</ref>

=== New music and reformation announced (2020) ===
It was announced that to coincide with the release of Before & After on vinyl, the band would release their first new music since 2002, with the single "Can't Kill The Musikk" a song originally started in the session following the 2002 album, but not completed until 2020.  The single was released on September 3, 2020, with a live version of "My Home Town" as the b-side.

On October 6, the band announced that they would be reforming to perform live dates.  3 dates in Sweden in March 2021 were announced, with a new press shot of the band, and live dates outside of their home country expected to follow.
