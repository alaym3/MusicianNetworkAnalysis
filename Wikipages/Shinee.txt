Shinee debuted in May 2008 with their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Replay (EP)|Replay]]'', on [[Seoul Broadcasting System|SBS]]' ''[[Inkigayo]]'' with their single "Replay". The group gained attention for starting a fashion trend amongst students, which the media dubbed the "Shinee Trend". In August 2008, the group released their first Korean studio album, ''[[The Shinee World]]'', which won Newcomer Album of the Year at the [[Golden Disc Awards|23rd Golden Disc Awards]]. Shinee further consolidated their popularity on the South Korean music scene with follow-up singles "[[Ring Ding Dong (Shinee song)|Ring Ding Dong]]" and "[[Lucifer (Shinee album)|Lucifer]]". "Ring Ding Dong" charted on top of several Korean music charts and gained popularity all over Asia. "Lucifer" was nominated for the Best Dance Performance Award at the [[Mnet Asian Music Awards]] in 2010 for its outstanding choreography. In 2012 the group released ''[[Sherlock (EP)|Sherlock]]'', which became the fifth most sold album of the year with over 180,000 copies sold. The group has also been included in the ''[[Forbes]]'' list of [[Forbes Korea Power Celebrity|Korea Power Celebrity]] multiple times, once in 2014 and again in 2016.

In mid-2011, Shinee signed with [[EMI Records Japan]] to venture into the Japanese music scene. Their Japanese version of their single "[[Replay (EP)#Background and release|Replay]]" sold over 100,000 copies, the highest number of sales for a Japanese debut single recorded by [[Oricon]] for a South Korean group at the time. It was followed by their first Japanese studio album, ''[[The First (album)|The First]]'', on December 7, 2011 – both were certified Gold by [[Recording Industry Association of Japan|RIAJ]] for selling over 100,000 copies. In 2011, the group also held their Japan Debut Premium Reception at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, making them the first Asian artists to perform there. Two years later they released their second Japanese album ''[[Boys Meet U (album)|Boys Meet U]]'' (2013), followed by ''[[I'm Your Boy]]'' (2014), ''[[D×D×D]]'' (2016), and ''[[Five (Shinee album)|Five]]'' (2017).

Shinee is considered to be one of the best live vocal groups in K-pop and is known for their highly synchronized and complex dance routines, having been awarded the Best Dance Performance Award at the Mnet Asian Music Awards [[List of awards and nominations received by Shinee|three times]] in a row for their dance performances to "[[Sherlock (Clue + Note)]]", "[[Dream Girl – The Misconceptions of You|Dream Girl]]" and "[[View (Shinee song)|View]]".
