'''Boyzone''' were an Irish [[boy band]]. They were put together in 1993 by [[Louis Walsh]], who is also known for managing [[Johnny Logan (singer)|Johnny Logan]] and [[Westlife]]. Before even recording any material, Boyzone made an appearance on RTÉ's ''[[The Late Late Show (Ireland)|The Late Late Show]]''. Their most famous line-up was composed of [[Keith Duffy]], [[Stephen Gately]], [[Michael Graham (singer)|Mikey Graham]], [[Ronan Keating]], and [[Shane Lynch]]. As of 2018, Boyzone have released seven studio albums and nine compilation albums.

In 2012, the [[Official Charts Company]] revealed the biggest selling singles artists in British music chart history, with Boyzone currently placed at 29th and the second most successful boy band in Britain, behind [[Take That]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/the-official-singles-charts-biggest-selling-artists-of-all-time-revealed-1431/ |title=Official Singles Charts' biggest selling artists of all time revealed |publisher=Officialcharts.com |access-date=17 February 2013}}</ref> According to the [[British Phonographic Industry]] (BPI), Boyzone has been certified for six million albums and over seven million singles in the UK,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certified-awards.aspx |title=Certified Awards |publisher=Bpi.co.uk |access-date=4 March 2019}}</ref> with 25 million records sold by 2013 worldwide.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hope|first1=Hannah|title=Boyzone celebrate 20 years at the top - and pledge to make it 50 like the Rolling Stones|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/boyzone-celebrate-20-years-top-2862385|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|access-date=1 January 2015|date=29 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/pictures/profiles/boyzone-v-take-that.php?ssid=3|title=Who's sold the most records? - Boyzone v Take That - Pictures - Music|website=Virginmedia.com|access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref>

Boyzone have had six UK No.1 singles and nine No.1 singles in Ireland. Of the 24 singles they released in the UK, 21 entered the top 40 (including 18 in the top 10 and 12 in the top 2) in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK]] charts and 22 singles (including 19 in the top 5) in the [[Irish Singles Chart|Irish]] charts. They have had  five No. 1 albums in the UK.

The group split in 1999. Boyzone made a comeback in 2007, originally with the intention of just touring. Gately died on 10 October 2009 of natural causes while on holiday in the Spanish island of [[Majorca]] with his civil partner, Andrew Cowles.

Boyzone went on tour in late 2018 to celebrate their 25th anniversary. An album to celebrate the anniversary was released on 16 November 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/gb/album/thank-you-goodnight/1394148956|title=Thank You & Goodnight by Boyzone on iTunes|website=Music.apple.com|access-date=16 October 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/09/05/boyzone-have-ditched-the-love-ballads-and-gone-urban-on-their-comeback-album-6904570/ |title=Boyzone have ditched the ballads and gone 'urban' for comeback album &#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=5 September 2017 |access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishmirror.ie/showbiz/irish-showbiz/keith-duffy-boyzone-getting-back-10349916 |title=Keith Duffy on Boyzone getting back together again after signing record deal for 25th anniversary - Irish Mirror Online |website=Irishmirror.ie |date=3 May 2017 |access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref> On 28 April 2018, it was announced that the band would split for good after their anniversary celebrations, which ended in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/1361300/boyzone-album-stephen-gately-ronan-keating-keith-duffy-shane-lynch|title=Boyzone 'to split for good' after Stephen Gately tribute|first=Mary|last=Gallagher|date=27 April 2018|website=Ok.co.uk}}</ref>

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2014}}

===''Said and Done'' (1993–1995)===
In 1993, an advertisement appeared in many Irish newspapers calling for auditions to form a new Irish "boy band" group. The advertisements were sent out by theatrical manager [[Louis Walsh]] who was looking to make an "Irish [[Take That]]" following on from their success. The auditions were held in The Ormond Center, in [[Dublin]], in November 1993. More than 300 people replied to the advertisement. At the auditions the applicants were asked to sing the song "[[Careless Whisper]]" by George Michael. Each audition would be taped and watched again to judge the applicant's performance. Out of the 300, 50 were selected for a second audition. For the second audition the applicants where asked to sing two songs, including one of their own choice with a backing tape. [[Mikey Graham]] sang "[[Two Out of Three Ain't Bad]]" by Meat Loaf, [[Keith Duffy]] sang "[[I'm Too Sexy]]" by Right Said Fred, [[Ronan Keating]] sang "[[Father and Son (song)|Father and Son]]" by Cat Stevens (a cover version of which the band would later release), and Stephen Gately sang "[[Hello (Lionel Richie song)|Hello]]" by Lionel Richie. Out of this 50, 10 were selected for a third audition. In the end, Keating, Gately, Duffy, Richard Rock (son of [[Dickie Rock]]), [[Shane Lynch]] and Mark Walton were chosen. This lineup of the group is most notable for making an infamous appearance on the [[The Late Late Show (Irish talk show)|Late Late Show]] in 1993 where they were mocked by both the audience and presenter [[Gay Byrne]] after a mimed performance to Clubhouse's dance hit Light My Fire. 

Graham originally was rejected but would later join after the departure of Rock, who left citing musical differences with Ronan Keating.{{cn|date=August 2021}}

Keating initially faced opposition from his parents and teachers. He was planning to move to New York to study in college on a sports scholarship and pursue his dream to win an [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medal for athletics. In the end Ronan decided to give up his education and go along with Boyzone. Duffy's parents were against their son throwing away a solid and promising career and joining the band. [[Louis Walsh]] set about trying to get a deal with a good record company but it would take many rejection letters before they would be signed. In 1994 Lynch and Duffy were involved in a car crash; both survived without serious injuries. Walsh was reportedly furious, and drew up contracts for all the bandmembers to sign, leading to their activities being restricted.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aditimukherjee.tripod.com/tthistory.htm|title=Totally Boyzone|website=Aditimukherjee.tripod.com|access-date=24 September 2015}}</ref> With some of the original lineup leaving and others being brought into the group, it took some time before Boyzone settled down into its most recognisable five-member line-up of Shane Lynch, Ronan Keating, Stephen Gately, Mikey Graham and Keith Duffy.

Boyzone played through 1994 in pubs and clubs all over Northern Ireland before [[PolyGram]] signed them up in 1994 and released the cover version of the [[The Four Seasons (group)|Four Seasons]]' hit "[[Working My Way Back to You]]", featuring Graham and Gately on lead vocals. It reached No. 3 in the Irish Charts. The release of their cover version of the classic [[Osmonds]]' hit, "[[Love Me for a Reason]]", broke into the British charts. The song hit No. 2 in the UK and was included in their 1995 hit debut album ''[[Said and Done]]''. The album reached the No. 1 spot in Ireland and the UK.  In 1995, the singles "[[Key to My Life]]", "[[So Good (Boyzone song)|So Good]]" and "[[Father and Son (song)|Father and Son]]" were released, which all got the attention of new fans in Europe.

===''A Different Beat'' (1996–1997)===
Their second album, ''[[A Different Beat (Boyzone album)|A Different Beat]]'', was released in 1996. It was the album that would bring the band worldwide success, and sold 2 million copies worldwide. The song "[[Coming Home Now]]" was released as a single. Boyzone had their first UK No. 1 single, a cover of the [[Bee Gees]]' hit "[[Words (Bee Gees song)|Words]]". The album also contained the hit singles "[[A Different Beat (song)|A Different Beat]]" and "[[Isn't It a Wonder]]".

In 1997, Boyzone released three singles: "Isn't It a Wonder", "[[Picture of You (Boyzone song)|Picture of You]]", and "[[Baby Can I Hold You/Shooting Star]]". The group performed "Let The Message Run Free" at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997]], co-hosted by Keating, in Dublin and tried to break the US market with their version of "Mystical Experience", which they also recorded in Spanish. Ronan Keating – who by now had emerged as the lead singer and frontman – won the [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for songwriting in 1997 for "Picture of You".

===''Where We Belong'' (1998)===
Their third studio album, ''[[Where We Belong (album)|Where We Belong]]'', was released in 1998 and featured Boyzone's writing abilities; the album sold over 3 million copies worldwide. It contained the hit singles "[[All That I Need]]" (which stayed for six weeks in the MTV Asia charts), "[[Baby Can I Hold You/Shooting Star|Baby Can I Hold You]]" ([[Tracy Chapman]] cover) and "[[No Matter What (Boyzone song)|No Matter What]]".

Originally written for the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] stage musical ''[[Whistle Down the Wind (1996 musical)|Whistle Down the Wind]]'', "No Matter What" was the group's best ever selling single selling over 4 million copies worldwide and it is the biggest selling record for a boy band, it was also voted Song of the Year, 1998. Since the song was also recorded by [[Meat Loaf]], Boyzone shared the stage with him to perform the song during his 1998 live concert in Dublin. They also sang the song in Italy with [[Luciano Pavarotti]]. Their 1998 tour of Ireland broke all sales records when 35,000 tickets were sold out in four hours.

===''By Request'' and break (1999–2000)===
In 1999, "When the Going Gets Tough", "You Needed Me" and "Every Day I Love You" were singles released which were worldwide hits. As well as their greatest hits compilation ''[[By Request (Boyzone album)|By Request]]''—the highest-selling Boyzone album, having sold over 4 million copies worldwide—a tour followed from May–July 1999 in Ireland, the UK and Europe. In June 1999, Stephen Gately revealed that he was gay and was in love with the ex-[[Caught in the Act (boy band)|Caught in the Act]] member Eloy de Jong. Also during this year Keating released his first solo single, "[[When You Say Nothing at All#Ronan Keating|When You Say Nothing at All]]", an [[Alison Krauss]] song which he had recorded for the movie ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]''.

In November 1999, after six years together and amid growing tensions behind the scenes, the group members decided to take some time off from Boyzone to pursue solo projects. Boyzone performed together for the last time in Ireland at the point depot during nine dates running from 3–8 January and 10–12 January 2000. They had sold more than 20 million records in total and all 16 of their singles reached the UK top five, making them the first Irish act to have four No. 1 hits in the United Kingdom charts.

===Hiatus (2001–2007)===
For seven years after their split, the members had mixed success in their individual careers. Keating in particular remained a force in the music industry as he continued writing and managing other bands. Gately also continued his career as a solo artist, appearing in a number of [[West End theatre|West End]] stage musicals, and Duffy had some success as an actor, including a role in the UK television soap ''[[Coronation Street]]''. Rumours came to a head and in early 2007 there were news reports that all five members and their manager, ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' judge Walsh, had met in Dublin to discuss and organise a comeback tour. On 11 October 2007, Walsh was interviewed on ''[[The Graham Norton Show]]''; when asked by [[Graham Norton|Norton]] whether there was going to be a re-launch of Boyzone he replied "I think so". On 5 November 2007, Keating confirmed that Boyzone would reunite for a special appearance on the BBC's annual fundraiser, ''[[Children in Need]]'', performing a medley of hits, although had not yet commented on the possibility of a new tour or album. On 14 November 2007, it was reported that all five members of Boyzone were to begin a UK tour in May, which would be their first in seven years. Keating, who left the group to pursue a solo career, joined them for the series of concerts. On 16 November, Boyzone made a comeback appearance as part of ''Children in Need'' on BBC1 in the UK, with an Irish and UK tour announced for June 2008.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7079524.stm | work=BBC News | title=Boyzone back for Children In Need | date=5 November 2007 | access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref>

===''Back Again... No Matter What'' tour and Gately's death (2008–2009)===
The group sold 200,000 tickets for the tour within three hours and sold 20,000 tickets on the first day of them going on sale for their concert in the RDS Dublin. Keating told the ''Daily Star'': "We've been taking it easy on the [[Guinness]] and been out for dinners and just a couple of drinks. We're taking the tour plans very seriously. We're all on diets and we've been training in the gym every day. I'm probably the fittest now that I've ever been. I think we all look better now than before. I can't wait to be back on the road and all the guys feel the same." The 29-date tour, taking in cities such as Cardiff, Newcastle, Liverpool, London at the O2 Arena and Wembley, Manchester, Birmingham, Glasgow, Aberdeen, Sheffield, Newcastle, Nottingham, Edinburgh Castle and the RDS in Dublin.

The tour began on 25 May 2008 at Belfast's [[Odyssey (Belfast)|Odyssey]] arena and finished at Carlisle Bitts Park on 23 August 2008. On 29 August 2008 Boyzone played alongside other acts such as [[Sandi Thom]] and [[Scouting For Girls]] at an event in Blackpool to switch on the [[Blackpool Illuminations]], an annual event in the town. The event received coverage on [[BBC Radio 2]]. On 3 September, the video for [[Love You Anyway]] debuted on the digital music channel [[The Box (UK and Ireland)|The Box]]. It features all five members of the best-known lineup of Boyzone with Keating taking most of the lead vocals. The single received its first play on 20 August 2008, live on [[Terry Wogan]]'s Radio 2 Breakfast show. On 6 October 2008, "Love You Anyway" entered the UK charts at No. 5, making it their 17th consecutive top five single. On 8 December their second single of 2008 "Better" was released and charted at No. 22 in the UK charts, No. 26 in the Irish charts and N. 63 in the European hot singles charts. On 28 August 2009 the group joined [[Yvette Fielding]] in Edinburgh for a ''[[Ghosthunting with...]]'' show for ITV2.

In 2009, Boyzone played their Better Tour, which was the last tour to feature Gately. On 10 October 2009, Gately died suddenly at his flat in [[Andratx|Port d'Andratx]], Majorca.<ref name="Boyzone star Stephen Gately dies">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8301187.stm|title=Boyzone star Stephen Gately dies|date=11 October 2009|access-date=11 October 2009|work=BBC}}</ref>  Gately's bandmates flew to Majorca on 11 October 2009;<ref name="Stephen Gately's Death 'Not Suspicious' says Gerald Kean">{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Boyzone-Star-Stephen-Gately-Dies-Aged-33-While-On-Holiday-In-Majorca/Article/200910215403550?lpos=Showbiz_News_News_Your_Way_Region_4&lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15403550_Boyzone_Star_Stephen_Gately_Dies_Aged_33_While_On_Holiday_In_Majorca |title=Stephen Gately's Death 'Not Suspicious' says Gerald Kean |date=11 October 2009 |access-date=11 October 2009 |publisher=[[Sky News]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091013155113/http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Boyzone-Star-Stephen-Gately-Dies-Aged-33-While-On-Holiday-In-Majorca/Article/200910215403550?lpos=Showbiz_News_News_Your_Way_Region_4&lid=NewsYourWay_ARTICLE_15403550_Boyzone_Star_Stephen_Gately_Dies_Aged_33_While_On_Holiday_In_Majorca |archive-date=13 October 2009 }}</ref> Walsh was expected to join them soon after.
