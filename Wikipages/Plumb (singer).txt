==Career==

Tiffany Arbuckle was born in [[Indianapolis]] but grew up in [[Atlanta]], singing in church and school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Plumb/e/B000APYECA |title=Plumb: Songs, Albums, Pictures, Bios |publisher=Amazon.com |date=March 9, 1975 |access-date=September 25, 2011}}</ref> She moved to Nashville one week before her 21st birthday, where she now resides,<ref>https://www.facebook.com/plumbmusic/info/</ref> and worked as a background singer for a number of artists, including [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] and [[Amy Grant]].<ref name="newreleasetuesday1">{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/article.php?article_id=989 |title=Plumb: Need You Now |publisher=NewReleaseTuesday.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref>

Plumb was originally formed in 1997 as a five-piece band that consisted of Arbuckle on vocals, Joe Porter on drums, Matt Stanfield on keyboards, J.J. Plasencio on bass guitar and Stephen Leiweke on guitar,<ref name="jesusfreakhideout1">{{cite web|url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Plumb.asp |title=Plumb: Jesus freak Hideout interview 1998 |publisher=JesusFreakHideout.com |access-date=April 7, 2021}}</ref> with name, Plumb, coming from the [[Suzanne Vega]] song "[[My Favorite Plum]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suzannevega.com/music-facts/ |title=Plumb interview |publisher=Suzannevega.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> Following [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]] affiliate Essential Records mainstream alternative radio success with its debut artist [[Jars of Clay]] in 1995, the label signed Plumb as its second artist.<ref name="amazon1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=87021915&s=143441 |title=After Lightning In A Bottle |publisher=Apple.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> When Arbuckle was urged to write, she turned to [[Matt Bronlewee]]—an original member of [[Jars of Clay]] who happened to be her next-door neighbor—and the two hit it off.<ref name="newreleasetuesday1"/> The debut album, ''[[Plumb (Plumb album)|Plumb]]'', was released in 1997. Plumb has said subsequently that the addition of the letter "B" to the end was the idea of her producer Matt Bronleewe and, in her mind, also represents Bronleewe's important contribution to her sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/interviews/Plumb.asp |title=Plumb interview |publisher=JesusFreakHideout.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref>

In 1999, Plumb released a second studio album, ''[[Candycoatedwaterdrops]]'', which won the 2000 Gospel Music Association [[Dove Award]] for "Modern [[Rock and roll|Rock]] Album of the Year". Three tracks from it were later covered by other artists; "[[Stranded (Plumb song)|Stranded]]" and "Here With Me" by [[Jennifer Paige]] and, in 2001, "Damaged" by [[Plummet (group)|Plummet]]. Though the album won the DOVE Award for Best Modern Rock Album in 2000,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Plumb |title=Plumb disco |publisher=discogs.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> and saw strong radio success with the single "God-Shaped Hole", the subject matter and approach of much of Plumb's music was often considered too dark and taboo for the mainstream Christian marketplace.<ref name="amazon2">{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Plumb/product-reviews/B00138HA5G |title=Plumb review |publisher=amazon.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> Plumb's tendency to write songs about deeply personal issues, such as international hit "Cut" which addressed [[self-harm|cutting]], and "Damaged" which addressed a girl coping with being molested as a child, led to more enthusiastic reception by fans of alternative and dance music.<ref name="amazon2"/> Fueling the break from CCM, "[[Cut (Plumb song)|Cut]]" was also used prominently during a pivotal scene in the storyline of ''The Vampire Diaries'' in the 10th episode of season 1, "The Turning Point".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM0qZ_XZpXk |title=Episode recap|publisher=YouTube.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> Later in 1999 all band members left the band, and since that time Plumb became a solo project of Tiffany Arbuckle.

Plumb considered leaving the music industry after the 2000 album, but changed her mind after receiving a note from a fan a few hours before what she thought to be her final concert. The letter was about her song "Damaged" about a girl coping with being molested as a child.<ref name="amazon1"/> The note said "Whatever you do, I just want you to never forget that you have changed someone's life," which inspired Plumb to remain in the music industry.<ref name="amazon1"/> She signed to [[Curb Records]] in 2003, releasing the album ''[[Beautiful Lumps of Coal]]'' on March 25, 2003. The lead single, "Real", peaked at No. 41 in the UK Singles Chart. Her next album, ''[[Chaotic Resolve]]'', entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart at No. 177 on March 9, 2006. "Better" reached No. 1 on the U.S. Christian airplay chart. The Bronleewe & Bose remix of her follow-up, "[[Cut (Plumb song)|Cut]]", hit No. 1 on [[SiriusXM]]'s dance hits channel BPM, and No. 5 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Dance Charts [[Hot Dance Club Songs]].<ref name="billboard1"/><ref name="billboard2">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/266441/chart-beat-wednesday-plumb-lady-antebellum-nickelback |title=Chart Beat |publisher=Billboard.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref>

Shortly after the birth of her second child, Plumb recorded her fifth album, ''[[Blink (Plumb album)|Blink]]'', as collection of lullaby inspired songs. It was released on October 9, 2007, immediately becoming one of her best selling and most enduring albums to date. Lead single "In My Arms", was used in conjunction with key plot narratives for both Vampire Diaries and One Tree Hill, and became Plumb's biggest international hit to date, selling close to half a million singles in both the United States and Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oth-music.com/episode517.html |title=One Tree Hill music |publisher=oth-music.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref><ref name="premierproductions1">{{cite web|url=http://www.premierproductions.com/artists/plumb |title=Artist bio |publisher=premiereproductions.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> "In My Arms" received remixes by [[Kaskade]], Scotty K, Bronleewe & Bose, Gomi, and Bimbo Jones, with the latter reaching the No. 3 spot on the ''Billboard'' Dance Charts.<ref name="billboard1"/><ref name="billboard2"/>

On May 19, 2009, [[Curb Records]] announced that it would release a career spanning greatest hits album, ''[[Beautiful History]]'', which was released later in the year and included several new songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=7611 |title=Beautiful History: A Hits Collection by Plumb &#124; CD Reviews And Information |publisher=NewReleaseTuesday.com |access-date=December 10, 2013}}</ref> The first single from Beautiful History, "Hang On", reached No.&nbsp;1 on US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Dance Club Play]] in 2009 and reached the top spot on ''Billboard'''s [[Hot Dance Airplay]] chart in 2010.<ref name="billboard1"/><ref name="billboard2"/>

Plumb returned to the studio in 2010 with longtime producer and co-writer Matt Bronleewe to begin work on what would become her 6th studio album, while also changing management and signing with alternative boutique firm Street Talk Media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newreleasetuesday.com/albumdetail.php?album_id=12101 |title=Need You Now review |publisher=newreleasetuesday.com |access-date=November 21, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://streettalkmedia.tumblr.com/clients |title=Street Talk Media |publisher=Streettalkmedia.tumblr.com |access-date=December 10, 2013}}</ref> The debut single from the project, "Drifting", a co-penned duet with longtime friend Dan Haseltine (of Jars of Clay), spread quickly across Christian Rock radio. The second single, "[[Need You Now (How Many Times)]]", went to [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] radio in early 2012 and has become Plumb's most successful single to date in that market, rising to number to No.&nbsp;1 on multiple radio and iTunes charts in both the United States and Canada by year's end.<ref name="billboard1"/> The single has remained in regular rotation nationwide for well over a year, selling close to 300,000 singles on iTunes to date, and is BDS certified at over 100,000 radio spins.<ref name="premierproductions1"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://plumbinfo.tumblr.com/about |title=About at |publisher=plumbmusic.net |access-date=November 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203041012/http://plumbinfo.tumblr.com/about |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The album ''[[Need You Now (Plumb album)|Need You Now]]'' was released worldwide in February 2013, charting at a career-best No.&nbsp;56 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart and No.&nbsp;2 on Christian album charts. The album received five Dove Award nominations including Song of the Year and Contemporary/Pop Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicrow.com/2013/08/tomlin-redman-haun-lead-44th-annual-dove-awards-nominations/ |title=2013 DOVE Award Nominees announced |publisher=musicrow.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref> With her children now all at least grade school age, and with the massive success of Need You Now, 2012 and 2013 saw the most aggressive touring of her entire career, playing major festivals throughout 2012 and 2013, embarking on her first and largely sold-out headlining tour in the fall of 2013, and joining the massive Winterjam arena tour for November 2013-14.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/plumb-joins-lineup-at-winter-jam-tour-spectacular-2014-with-newsboys-lecrae-108443/ |title=Plumb joins WinterJam |publisher=Christianpost.com |access-date=November 16, 2013}}</ref>

Plumb left Curb Records in early 2017 to form her own label, Plumb Music, and released her first single "God Help Me" in July 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://daily.plaympe.com/plumb-god-help-me/ |title=Plumb - God Help Me Daily Play MPE |publisher=PlayMPE |access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelmusic.org/plumb-returns-with-god-help-me-single-available-today/ |title=PLUMB Returns with "God Help Me" Single, Available Today |publisher=Gospel Music Association |access-date=August 2, 2017}}</ref> The song was one of six tracks included on the EP ''God Help Me'' in late 2017.<ref name="BeautifullyBrokenJFH">{{cite web |last1=Balogh |first1=Josh |title=Jesusfreakhideout.com: Plumb, "Beautifully Broken" Review |url=https://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/cdreviews/BeautifullyBroken.asp |website=www.jesusfreakhideout.com |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |access-date=July 24, 2018}}</ref> She followed it up with the album ''Beautifully Broken'' in June 2018 on [[Centricity Music]].<ref name="BeautifullyBrokenJFH" />

Following the No.&nbsp;1 chart successes of "In My Arms", "Hang On", and "Cut", Plumb has been increasingly sought-after in the dance and electronic world. In 2011, she collaborated with trance DJ [[Paul Van Dyk]] on "I Don't Deserve You", playing several shows with Van Dyk, and filming a music video together in middle Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/474929/paul-van-dyk-video-premiere-i-dont-deserve-you |title=Paul van Dyk Video Premiere: I Don't Deserve You |publisher=Billboard |access-date=December 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZpeJhS8POtM |title=Paul van Dyk - I Don't Deserve You ft.
