The '''Boreads''' ({{lang-grc|Βορεάδαι|Boreádai}}) are the "wind brothers" in [[Greek mythology]]. They consist of '''Zetes''' (also '''Zethes''') ({{lang-grc|Ζήτης}}) and '''Calaïs''' ({{lang-grc|Κάλαϊς}}). Their place of origin was [[Thrace]], home of their father [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]] (North wind).

== Description ==
Zetes and Calais were credited with very delicate and graceful hair, which was said to give them the ability to fly. They had great pride in who had the longest curls between the two of them and by boasting about these locks, they were uplifted.<ref name=":0">[[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], ''Chiliades'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.htm#7 1.7 lines 210-213] & [http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades12.html#13 12.13 lines 442-443]</ref> They had dusky wings which gleamed with golden scales.<ref name="Appollonius">[[Apollonius Rhodius]], [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/830]</ref>

== Family ==
The Boreads were the sons of Boreas and [[Oreithyia]], daughter of King [[Erechtheus]] of [[Athens]]. They were the brothers of [[Chione (daughter of Boreas)|Chione]] and [[Cleopatra (Greek myth)|Cleopatra]], wife of [[Phineus]].

==Mythology==
[[Image:Phineus Boreads Louvre G364.jpg|thumb|220px|The Boreads rescuing [[Phineus]] from the [[Harpies]], column-[[krater]] by the [[Leningrad Painter]], {{circa|460 BC}}, [[Louvre]]|left]]
Due to being sons of the north wind they were supernaturally gifted in different ways (depending on changes in the story from being passed down through generations and cultures) either being as fast as the wind or able to fly, having wings either on their feet or backs, depending on the myth.<ref name=Appollonius/>{{rp|I, 211–223}} According to Ovid's ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', their divine status showed in manhood when they sprouted wings on their backs.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Roman|first=Luke|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tOgWfjNIxoMC|title=Encyclopedia of Greek and Roman Mythology|last2=Roman|first2=Monica|date=2010|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-1-4381-2639-5|pages=104|language=en}}</ref>

They were [[Argonauts]] and played a particularly vital role in the rescue of Phineus from the [[Harpy|harpies]]. They succeeded in driving the monsters away but did not kill them, at a request from the goddess of the rainbow, [[Iris (mythology)|Iris]], who promised that Phineas would not be bothered by the harpies again. As thanks, Phineas told the Argonauts how to pass the [[Symplegades]]. It is said that the Boreads were turned back by Iris at the [[Strophades]]. The islands' name, meaning "Islands of Turning", refers to this event.<ref name=Appollonius/>{{rp|I, 240–300}}

Calais in one tradition is said to be the beloved of [[Orpheus]];<ref name="Crawford2010">{{cite book|author=Katherine Crawford|title=The Sexual Culture of the French Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z9TU7ZKzANkC&pg=PA28|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-76989-1|page=28}}</ref><ref name="Friedman2000">{{cite book|author=John Block Friedman|title=Orpheus in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_56pgczDQ8sC&pg=PA9|date=2000-05-01|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-2825-5|page=9}}</ref> Orpheus was said to have been killed at the hands of jealous Thracian women whilst he wandered the countryside thinking of Calais.<ref>Phanocles, ''The Death of Orpheus''</ref>

Their death was said to be caused by [[Heracles]] on Tenos in revenge for when they convinced the Argonauts to leave him behind as he searched for [[Hylas]].<ref name=Appollonius/>{{rp|I, 1296–1314}}

Other sources imply that the sons of Boreas died chasing the harpies, as it was fated that they would perish if they failed to catch those they pursued.<ref>Tzetzes, ''Chiliades'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.htm#7 1.7 line 217]</ref> In some versions, the harpies drop into the sea from exhaustion and so their pursuers fall as well.

According to a rare variant of the myth by [[John Tzetzes|Tzetzes]], the old man Phineus who was blind because of old age had two daughters named Eraseia and Harpyreia. These two lived in a very libertine and lazy life which was all wasted. Ultimately, the sisters abandoned themselves into poverty and fatal famine and were eventually snatched away by Zetes and Calais, disappearing from those places ever since.<ref>Tzetzes, ''Chiliades'' [http://www.theoi.com/Text/TzetzesChiliades1.htm#7 1.7 lines 218-227]</ref>

==Popular culture==
The Boreads appear in ''[[The Heroes of Olympus]]'' series by [[Rick Riordan]], where they reside in [[Quebec City]] with their sister [[Chione (daughter of Boreas)|Khione]] and their father [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]]. After their death, their father Boreas transformed them into immortal demigods to act as his lieutenants. In the novels, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Minor Greco-Roman gods|Calais]] (referred to as "Cal") struggles with words that have more than two syllables, including his own name. He has an obsession with [[ice hockey]] and [[pizza]]. [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Minor Greco-Roman gods|Zetes]] is by far the more intelligent of the two, though he has his own quirks as well. He is [[metrosexual]] and tries to woo the character [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Piper McLean|Piper McLean]] each time he encounters her.<ref name="Lost Hero">{{cite book | title=The Lost Hero | publisher=Disney-Hyperion | author=Riordan, Rick | author-link=Rick Riordan | year=2010 | location=New York, New York | isbn=978-1-4231-1339-3 | url=https://archive.org/details/losthero00rick }}</ref> Both Boreads are teenaged, with purple wings and silvery hair; possess a deep-seated respect for anyone named Jason (because of their role as [[Argonauts]]); and carry jagged [[bronze]] [[sword]]s.
