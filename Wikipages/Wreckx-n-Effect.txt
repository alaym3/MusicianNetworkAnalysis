'''Wreckx-n-Effect''' (originally '''Wrecks-n-Effect''') is an American [[new jack swing]] group from [[Harlem]], [[New York City]] most known for their No. 1 Rap songs, "[[New Jack Swing (song)|New Jack Swing]]" & their multi-platinum hit "[[Rump Shaker (song)|Rump Shaker]]". 

==History==
Wrecks-n-Effect was founded in 1988 by Aqil Davidson, Markell Riley and Brandon "B-Doggs" Mitchell. A fourth member: Keith "K.C." Harris, was added while creating their demo but was a member only on their debut EP. One year later, Davidson, Riley and Mitchell reconvened and recorded their First LP containing New Jack Swing. Markell Riley is the brother of [[new jack swing]] producer [[Teddy Riley]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=XXL Staff |title=The Current Status of Every Murdered Rapper's Case |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/current-status-murdered-rappers-cases/ |website=XXL.com |publisher=XXL |access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref> The group debuted in 1988 on [[Atlantic Records]] and soon after transitioned to [[Motown Records]]. The group achieved their first number one song on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Hot Rap Songs]] chart with the single "[[New Jack Swing (song)|New Jack Swing]]" in 1989 on Motown Records.

In 1990 former member DJ "B-Doggs" Brandon Mitchell was killed in a local shootout, which nearly caused Davidson and Riley to end the group. The group continued after encouragement from producer [[Teddy Riley]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. Aqil Davidson changed the spelling of Wrecks-n-Effect to Wreckx-n-Effect in honor of Mitchell.

In 1991 Teddy Riley built Future Recording Studios, a multi-million dollar recording studio in [[Virginia Beach]], [[Virginia|VA]]. Among the first records produced at Future Recording Studios was Wreckx-n-Effect's 1992 smash [[Rump Shaker (song)|Rump Shaker]], which would go on to reach number 2 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Wreckx-n-Effect also recorded their 1992 album [[Hard or Smooth]] at Future Recording Studios, which would go on to sell roughly 2 million copies and peak at number 16 on the [[Billboard 200]].

Wreckx-n-Effect was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>
