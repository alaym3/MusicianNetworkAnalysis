'''Luciano Pavarotti''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Cavaliere di Gran Croce OMRI]]}} ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|v|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|t|i}}, {{IPAc-en|USalso|ˌ|p|ɑː|v|-}}, {{IPA-it|luˈtʃaːno pavaˈrɔtti|lang}}; 12 October 1935{{spaced ndash}}6 September 2007) was an Italian operatic [[tenor]] who during the late part of his career crossed over into [[popular music]], eventually becoming one of the most acclaimed and loved tenors of all time. He made numerous recordings of complete [[opera]]s and individual [[aria]]s, gaining worldwide fame for his tone, and achieving the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|honorific title]] "King of the [[High C]]s".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2400534.ece|title=Obituary: Luciano Pavarotti|work=[[The Times]]|place=London|date= 6 September 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725095137/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article2400534.ece|archive-date=25 July 2008}}</ref><ref>Warrack, John and Ewan West (1996).

==Early life and musical training==
Luciano Pavarotti was born in 1935 on the outskirts of [[Modena]] in [[Northern Italy]], the son of Fernando Pavarotti, a baker and amateur tenor, and Adele Venturi, a cigar factory worker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/36/Luciano-Pavarotti.html|title=Luciano Pavarotti Biography (1935–)|publisher=Film reference.com|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> Although he spoke fondly of his childhood, the family had little money; its four members were crowded into a two-room apartment. According to Pavarotti, his father had a fine tenor voice but rejected the possibility of a singing career because of nervousness. [[World War II]] forced the family out of the city in 1943. For the following year they rented a single room from a farmer in the neighbouring countryside, where the young Pavarotti developed an interest in farming.

After abandoning the dream of becoming a [[association football|football]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], Pavarotti spent seven years in vocal training. Pavarotti's earliest musical influences were his father's records, most of them featuring the popular tenors of the day—[[Beniamino Gigli]], [[Giovanni Martinelli]], [[Tito Schipa]], and [[Enrico Caruso]]. Pavarotti's favourite tenor and idol was [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]] and he was also deeply influenced by [[Mario Lanza]], saying: "In my teens I used to go to Mario Lanza movies and then come home and imitate him in the mirror". At around the age of nine he began singing with his father in a small local church choir.

In addition to music, as a child Pavarotti enjoyed playing [[Association football|football]]. When he graduated from the Scuola Magistrale he was interested in pursuing a career as a professional football [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]], but his mother convinced him to train as a teacher. He subsequently taught in an elementary school for two years but finally decided to pursue a music career. His father, recognising the risk involved, only reluctantly gave his consent.

Pavarotti began the serious study of music in 1954 at the age of 19 with [[Arrigo Pola]], a respected teacher and professional tenor in Modena who offered to teach him without remuneration. According to conductor [[Richard Bonynge]], Pavarotti never learned to read music.<ref>{{YouTube|CYJ8Wp2U6w8|"Richard Bonynge Talking Pavarotti" Interview}}</ref>

In 1955, he experienced his first singing success when he was a member of the Corale Rossini, a [[male voice choir]] from Modena that also included his father, which won first prize at the [[Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod|International Eisteddfod]] in [[Llangollen]], Wales. He later said that this was the most important experience of his life, and that it inspired him to become a professional singer.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/6981188.stm |title=Pavarotti eisteddfod career start |access-date=7 September 2007 |date=6 September 2007 |publisher=BBC Online}}</ref> At about this time Pavarotti first met Adua Veroni. They married in 1961.

When his teacher Arrigo Pola moved to Japan, Pavarotti became a student of [[Ettore Campogalliani]], who at that time was also teaching Pavarotti's childhood friend, [[Mirella Freni]], whose mother worked with Luciano's mother in the cigar factory. Like Pavarotti, Freni went on to become a successful opera singer; they would go on to collaborate in various stage performances and recordings together.

During his years of musical study, Pavarotti held part-time jobs in order to sustain himself—first as an elementary school teacher and then as an insurance salesman. The first six years of study resulted in only a few recitals, all in small towns and without pay. When a [[vocal fold nodule|nodule]] developed on his [[vocal folds|vocal cords]], causing a ''"disastrous"'' concert in [[Ferrara]], he decided to give up singing. Pavarotti attributed his immediate improvement to the psychological release connected with this decision. Whatever the reason, the nodule not only disappeared but, as he related in his autobiography: "Everything I had learned came together with my natural voice to make the sound I had been struggling so hard to achieve".

==Career==

===1960s–1970s===
Pavarotti began his career as a tenor in smaller regional Italian opera houses, making his debut as Rodolfo in ''[[La bohème]]'' at the [[Teatro Municipale di Reggio|Teatro Municipale]] in [[Reggio Emilia]] in April 1961.  His first known recording of "[[Che gelida manina]]" was recorded during this performance.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.gramophone.co.uk/feature/luciano-pavarotti-the-birth-of-a-legend|title=Luciano Pavarotti – the birth of a legend |first=Philip|last= Kennicott |date=13 March 2015|work=Gramophone }}</ref>

[[File:Luciano Pavarotti 72.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Luciano Pavarotti in 1972]]

He made his first international appearance in ''[[La traviata]]'' in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. Very early in his career, on 23 February 1963, he debuted at the [[Vienna State Opera]] in the same role. In March and April 1963 Vienna saw Pavarotti again as Rodolfo and as Duca di Mantova in ''[[Rigoletto]]''. The same year saw his first concert outside Italy when he sang in [[Dundalk]], Ireland for the St Cecilia's Gramophone Society, he was engaged by the Dublin Grand Opera Society to sing The Duke of Mantua in Verdi's [[Rigoletto]] in May and June, and his [[The Royal Opera|Royal Opera House]] debut, where he replaced an indisposed [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]] as Rodolfo.<ref>Paul Arendt, [https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2164106,00.html "It Was All About the Voice"], ''The Guardian''(London), 7 September 2007</ref><ref>Cunningham, Jimmy (13 September 2007).

Retrieved 29 January 2013</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/1963s-theatre-brochure/page/n7/mode/2up "1963 Concert Program, Dublin Grand Opera Society"]</ref>

There exist on archive.org three complete performances from Pavarotti's early career in 1964, when he was engaged by the Dublin Grand Opera Society to sing Rudolfo in Giacomo Puccini's ''[[La bohème]]'' <ref>[[iarchive:1964s-la-boheme-dgos/page/9/mode/2up]]</ref> (Audio recording of [[iarchive:1964s-boheme-dgos|LA BOHEME]] Presented on May 19, 21, 27, Jun 1 1964 at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin as part of the Dublin Grand Opera Society’s Spring Season) and Alfredo in Giuseppe Verdi's ''[[La Traviata]]'' <ref>[[iarchive:1964s-la-traviata-dgos|]]</ref> (Audio recording of [[iarchive:1964s-traviata-dgos-bardelli|LA TRAVIATA]] Presented on Jun 8 1964 at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin as part of the Dublin Grand Opera Society's Spring Season, Audio recording of [[iarchive:1964s-traviata-dgos-taddei|LA TRAVIATA]] Presented on May 25, 1964 at the Gaiety Theatre Dublin as part of the Dublin Grand Opera Society's Spring Season). Also available are reviews of those performances in which the reviewers favorably comment on his singing (from the reviews for "La Boheme"): "sang sweetly and appealingly," "rich promise," "outstanding," "fit for the big heroic roles," and "robust;" his voice: "pure tone", "arresting quality," "unforced strength and range," "well sustained," and "lovely;" and his acting: "looked and moved well," "sang with musically-directed intelligence," "used the voice to reinforce his acting," and "chief delight of the evening."<ref>[https://operainireland.wordpress.com/1964-la-boheme-puccini-2/]</ref>

While generally successful, Pavarotti's early roles did not immediately propel him into the stardom that he would later enjoy. An early coup involved his connection with [[Joan Sutherland]] (and her conductor husband, [[Richard Bonynge]]), who in 1963 was seeking a tenor taller than herself to take along on her 1965 tour to Australia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2164106,00.html Joan Sutherland quoted in Paul Arendt, "It Was All About the Voice,"] ''The Guardian'', (London), 7 September 2007: "The young Pavarotti was a revelation to the opera world. He made his debut in the United States with us in Miami in 1965. He then came as part of our company to Australia, where he sang three times a week for 14 weeks, and we went on to make countless recordings together".</ref> With his commanding physical presence, Pavarotti proved ideal.<ref>Richard Dyer, [http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2007/09/06/opera_star_luciano_pavarotti_dies  "Opera star Luciano Pavarotti dies: Epic career spanned 40 years"], ''The Boston Globe'', 6 September 2007</ref>

However, before the summer 1965 Australia tour Pavarotti sang with Joan Sutherland when he made his American début with the [[Florida Grand Opera|Greater Miami Opera]] in February 1965, singing in [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' on the stage of the [[Miami-Dade County]] Auditorium in Miami. The tenor scheduled to perform that night became ill with no understudy. As Sutherland had plans to travel with him on the Australia tour that summer, she recommended the young Pavarotti as he was acquainted with the role.

Shortly after, on 28 April, Pavarotti made his [[La Scala]] debut in the revival of the famous [[Franco Zeffirelli]] production of ''La bohème,'' with his childhood friend [[Mirella Freni]] singing Mimi and [[Herbert von Karajan]] conducting. Karajan had requested the singer's engagement.

During the Australia tour in summer 1965 Sutherland and Pavarotti sang some forty performances over two months, and Pavarotti later credited Sutherland for the breathing technique that would sustain him over his career.<ref>Ariel David, [http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&sid=1240287 "World Mourns Italian Tenor Pavarotti"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926211341/http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=105&sid=1240287 |date=26 September 2007 }}, WTOPnews.com, 6 September 2007</ref>

[[File:Pavarotti - Sutherland 1976.jpg|thumb|upright|With [[Joan Sutherland]] in ''I puritani'' (1976)]]

After the extended Australian tour, he returned to La Scala, where he added Tebaldo from ''[[I Capuleti e i Montecchi]]'' to his repertoire on 26 March 1966, with [[Giacomo Aragall]] as Romeo. His first appearance as Tonio in Donizetti's ''[[La fille du régiment]]'' took place at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, on 2 June of that year. It was his performances of this role that would earn him the title of "King of the High Cs".

He scored another major triumph in Rome on 20 November 1969 when he sang in ''[[I Lombardi alla prima crociata|I Lombardi]]'' opposite [[Renata Scotto]]. This was recorded on a private label and widely distributed, as were various recordings of his ''I Capuleti e i Montecchi,'' usually with Aragall. Early commercial recordings included a recital of Donizetti (the aria from ''[[Dom Sébastien|Don Sebastiano]]'' were particularly highly regarded) and [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] [[aria]]s, as well as a complete ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'' with Sutherland.

His major breakthrough in the United States came on 17 February 1972, in a production of ''La fille du régiment'' at New York's [[Metropolitan Opera]], in which he drove the crowd into a frenzy with his nine effortless [[tenor C|high Cs]] in the signature [[aria]]. He achieved a record seventeen curtain calls.

Pavarotti sang his international [[recital]] début at [[William Jewell College]] in [[Liberty, Missouri]], on 1 February 1973, as part of the college's Fine Arts Program, now known as the [https://web.archive.org/web/20101124122156/http://hjseries.org/web/page.aspx?title=About Harriman–Jewell Series]. Perspiring due to nerves and a lingering cold, the tenor clutched a handkerchief throughout the début. The prop became a signature part of his solo performances.

He began to give frequent television performances, starting with his performances as Rodolfo (''La bohème'') in the first [[Live from the Met]] telecast in March 1977, which attracted one of the largest audiences ever for a televised opera. He won many [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] awards and [[platinum disc|platinum]] and [[gold disc]]s for his performances. In addition to the previously listed titles, his ''[[La favorite]]'' with [[Fiorenza Cossotto]] and his ''[[I puritani]]'' (1975) with Sutherland stand out.

In 1976, Pavarotti debuted at the [[Salzburg Festival]], appearing in a solo recital on 31 July, accompanied by pianist Leone Magiera. Pavarotti returned to the festival in 1978 with a recital and as the Italian singer in ''[[Der Rosenkavalier]]'' in 1983 with ''[[Idomeneo]],'' and both in 1985 and 1988 with solo recitals.

In 1979, he was profiled in a cover story in the weekly magazine ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19790924,00.html|title=Time Magazine Cover: Luciano Pavarotti |date=24 September 1979|publisher=Time–Life|access-date=2 January 2017}}</ref> That same year saw Pavarotti's return to the [[Vienna State Opera]] after an absence of fourteen years. With Herbert von Karajan conducting, Pavarotti sang Manrico in ''[[Il trovatore]].'' In 1978, he appeared in a solo recital on ''[[Live from Lincoln Center]].''

===1980s–1990s===
At the beginning of the 1980s, he set up The Pavarotti International Voice Competition for young singers, performing with the winners in 1982 in excerpts of ''La bohème'' and ''L'elisir d'amore''. The second competition, in 1986, staged excerpts of ''La bohème'' and ''Un ballo in maschera''. To celebrate the 25th anniversary of his career, he brought the winners of the competition to Italy for gala performances of ''La bohème'' in Modena and [[Genoa]], and then to China where they staged performances of ''La bohème'' in Beijing ([[Peking]]). To conclude the visit, Pavarotti performed the inaugural concert in the [[Great Hall of the People]] before 10,000 people, receiving a [[standing ovation]] for nine effortless high Cs. The third competition in 1989 again staged performances of ''L'elisir d'amore'' and ''Un ballo in maschera''. The winners of the fifth competition accompanied Pavarotti in performances in [[Philadelphia]] in 1997.

In the mid-1980s, Pavarotti returned to two opera houses that had provided him with important breakthroughs, the [[Vienna State Opera]] and [[La Scala]]. Vienna saw Pavarotti as Rodolfo in ''La bohème'' with [[Carlos Kleiber]] conducting and again Mirella Freni was Mimi; as Nemorino in ''L'elisir d'amore''; as Radames in ''Aida'' conducted by Lorin Maazel; as Rodolfo in ''Luisa Miller''; and as Gustavo in ''Un ballo in maschera'' conducted by Claudio Abbado. In 1996, Pavarotti appeared for the last time at the Staatsoper in ''Andrea Chénier''.  Throughout the 1980s and 90s, promoters [[Tibor Rudas]] and [[Harvey Goldsmith]] booked Pavarotti into increasingly larger venues.

[[File:Lucio Dalla, Pavarotti e Zucchero al Pavarotti e friends 1992.jpg|thumb|left|From left: journalist Vincenzo Mollica, Pavarotti, [[Lucio Dalla]] and [[Zucchero Fornaciari|Zucchero]] on the first edition of ''[[Pavarotti & Friends]]'' (1992)]]

In 1985, Pavarotti sang Radames at La Scala opposite Maria Chiara in a Luca Ronconi production conducted by Maazel, recorded on video. His performance of the aria "Celeste Aida" received a two-minute ovation on the opening night. He was reunited with Mirella Freni for the San Francisco Opera production of ''La bohème'' in 1988, also recorded on video. In 1992, La Scala saw Pavarotti in a new Zeffirelli production of ''Don Carlos'', conducted by Riccardo Muti. Pavarotti's performance was heavily criticised by some observers and booed by parts of the audience.

Pavarotti became even better known throughout the world in 1990 when his rendition of the aria "[[Nessun dorma]]" from [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Turandot]]'' was taken as the theme song of [[BBC]]'s coverage of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup]] in Italy. The aria achieved pop status, became the World Cup soundtrack, and it remained his trademark song.<ref>{{cite news |title=A riot of colour, emotion and memories: the World Cup stands alone in the field of sport|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/world-cup-russia-2018-preview-lionel-messi-ronaldo-italia-90-98-england-brazil-germany-france-a8392211.html |access-date=20 August 2018 |work=The Independent}}</ref> This was followed by the first [[Three Tenors]] concert, held on the eve of the [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final]] at the ancient [[Baths of Caracalla]] in Rome with fellow tenors [[Plácido Domingo]] and [[José Carreras]] and conductor [[Zubin Mehta]]. The performance for the World Cup closing concert captivated a global audience, and it became the biggest selling classical record of all time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Pavarotti, top tenors sing for World Cup crowds |url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1990/07/08/Pavarotti-top-tenors-sing-for-World-Cup-crowds/1118647409600/ |access-date=24 August 2018 |agency=Upi}}</ref> A highlight of the concert, in which Pavarotti hammed up a famous portion of di Capua's "[[O Sole Mio]]" and was mimicked by Domingo and Carreras to the delight of the audience, became one of the most memorable moments in contemporary operatic history. Throughout the 1990s, Pavarotti appeared in many well-attended outdoor concerts, including his televised concert in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], which drew a record attendance of 150,000. In June 1993, more than 500,000 listeners gathered for his free performance on the Great Lawn of New York's [[Central Park]], while millions more around the world watched on television. The following September, in the shadow of the [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris, he sang for an estimated crowd of 300,000. Following on from the original 1990 concert, the Three Tenors concerts were held during the three subsequent [[List of FIFA World Cup finals|FIFA World Cup Finals]], in 1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama.<ref name="FIFA">{{cite book |title=The Music Industry Handbook |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |page=219}}</ref>

[[File:Elton John with Luciano Pavarotti in Modena 1996.jpg|thumb|[[Elton John]] and Pavarotti in Modena, 1996]]

In September 1995, Pavarotti performed Schubert's [[Ave Maria (Schubert)|Ave Maria]] along with [[Dolores O'Riordan]]; [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], who attended the live performance, told O'Riordan that the song brought her to tears.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aleteia.org/2018/01/15/when-the-cranberries-dolores-oriordan-sang-ave-maria-with-pavarotti|title=When the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan sang 'Ave Maria' with Pavarotti|work=[[Aleteia]]|first=Mauro|last=J-P|date=15 January 2018|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> In 1995, Pavarotti's friends, the singer [[Lara Saint Paul]] (as Lara Cariaggi) and her husband showman Pier Quinto Cariaggi, who had produced and organised Pavarotti's 1990 FIFA World Cup Celebration Concert at the [[PalaSharp|PalaTrussardi]] in Milan,<ref>[http://home.earthlink.net/~beachwoodprs/html/PAVAROTTI.htm Pavarotti, Luciano: ''The Event, The World Cup Celebration Concert (1990)''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124235051/http://home.earthlink.net/~beachwoodprs/html/PAVAROTTI.htm |date=24 January 2009 }}</ref> produced and wrote the television documentary ''The Best is Yet to Come'', an extensive biography about the life of Pavarotti.<ref name="web.archive.org">[https://web.archive.org/web/20090124172647/http://203.221.255.21/opacs/TitleDetails?displayid=137394&collection=all&displayid=0&fieldcode=2&from=BasicSearch&genreid=0&ITEMID=%24VARS.getItemId%28%29&original=%24VARS.getOriginal%28%29&pageno=1&phrasecode=1&searchwords=Lara%20Saint%20Paul%20&status=2&subjectid=0&index= Pavarotti: ''The Best is Yet to Come''], Penrith City Library Catalogue</ref> Lara Saint Paul was the interviewer for the documentary with Pavarotti, who spoke candidly about his life and career.<ref name="web.archive.org"/>

Pavarotti's rise to stardom was not without occasional difficulties, however. He earned a reputation as "The King of Cancellations" by frequently backing out of performances, and his unreliable nature led to poor relationships with some opera houses. This was brought into focus in 1989 when [[Ardis Krainik]] of the [[Lyric Opera of Chicago]] severed the house's 15-year relationship with the tenor.<ref name="Ref-1">Herbert H. Breslin, ''The King and I: The Uncensored Tale of Luciano Pavarotti's Rise to Fame by His Manager, Friend and Sometime Adversary,'' New York: Doubleday Publishing, 2004 {{ISBN|978-0-385-50972-5}} {{ISBN|0-385-50972-3}}</ref> Over an eight-year period, Pavarotti had cancelled 26 out of 41 scheduled appearances at the Lyric, and the decisive move by Krainik to ban him for life was well noted throughout the opera world, after the performer walked away from a season premiere less than two weeks before rehearsals began, saying pain from a sciatic nerve required two months of treatment.

On 12 December 1998, he became the first (and, to date, only) opera singer to perform on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', singing alongside [[Vanessa L. Williams]]. He also sang with [[U2]] in the band's 1995 song "[[Miss Sarajevo]]" and with [[Mercedes Sosa]] in a big concert at the [[Boca Juniors]] arena [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|La Bombonera]] in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1999.

In 1998, Pavarotti was presented with the [[Grammy Legend Award]].

===Early 2000s===
[[File:Luciano Pavarotti 15.06.02 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Luciano Pavarotti performing on 15 June 2002 at a concert in the [[Stade Vélodrome]] in [[Marseille]]]]
In 2004, one of Pavarotti's former managers, [[Herbert Breslin]], published a book, ''The&nbsp;King&nbsp;&&nbsp;I''.<ref name="Ref-1"/> Seen by critics as bitter and sensationalistic, it is critical of the singer's acting (in opera), his inability to read music well and learn parts, and his personal conduct, although acknowledging their success together. In an interview in 2005 with [[Jeremy Paxman]] on the [[BBC]], Pavarotti rejected the allegation that he could not read music, although he acknowledged he did not read orchestral scores.

He received an enormous number of awards and honours, including [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 2001.

===Final performances and health issues===
[[File:Luciano Pavarotti IMAX.JPG|thumb|upright|190px|Statue of Pavarotti in [[IMAX|Eilat IMAX]]]]
Pavarotti began his farewell tour in 2004, at the age of 69, performing one last time in old and new locations, after more than four decades on the stage. On 13 March 2004, Pavarotti gave his last performance in an opera at the [[New York Metropolitan Opera]], for which he received a long standing ovation for his role as the painter Mario Cavaradossi in [[Giacomo Puccini]]'s ''[[Tosca]].'' On 1 December 2004, he announced a 40-city farewell tour. Pavarotti and his manager, Terri Robson, commissioned impresario [[Harvey Goldsmith]] to produce the Worldwide Farewell Tour. His last full-scale performance was at the end of a two-month [[Australasia]]n tour in Taiwan in December 2005.

In March 2005, Pavarotti underwent neck surgery to repair two [[vertebrae]]. In early 2006, he underwent further back surgery and contracted an infection while in the hospital in New York, forcing cancellation of concerts in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/5212832.stm |title=Pavarotti 'will return to stage' |access-date=5 September 2007 |work=BBC News |date=25 July 2006}}</ref>

On 10 February 2006, Pavarotti performed "[[Nessun dorma]]" at the [[2006 Winter Olympics opening ceremony]] in [[Turin]], Italy, at his final performance. In the last act of the opening ceremony, his performance received the longest and loudest ovation of the night from the international crowd. Leone Magiera, who directed the performance, revealed in his 2008 memoirs, ''Pavarotti Visto da Vicino'', that the performance had been recorded weeks earlier.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kington|first=Tom|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/07/classicalmusicandopera.italy|title=Pavarotti mimed at final performance|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 April 2008|access-date=28 August 2009 | location=London}}</ref> "The orchestra pretended to play for the audience, I pretended to conduct and Luciano pretended to sing. The effect was wonderful," he wrote. Pavarotti's manager, Terri Robson, said that the tenor had turned the Winter Olympic Committee's invitation down several times because it would have been impossible to sing late at night in the subzero conditions of Turin in February. The committee eventually persuaded him to take part by prerecording the song.

He posthumously received the [[Italy-USA Foundation]]'s America Award in 2013 and the [[Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music]] in 2014.

===Film and television===
[[File:Luciano Pavarotti Karen Kondazian 1981 wiki.jpg|thumb|right|Pavarotti embraces [[Karen Kondazian]] on the set of ''[[Yes, Giorgio]]'']]
Pavarotti's one venture into film was ''[[Yes, Giorgio]]'' (1982), a romantic comedy movie directed by [[Franklin J. Schaffner]], in which he starred as the main character Giorgio Fini. The film was a critical and commercial failure, although it received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Music, Original Song.

He can be seen to better advantage in [[Jean-Pierre Ponnelle]]'s adaptation of ''[[Rigoletto]]'' for television, released that same year, or in his more than 20 live opera performances taped for television between 1978 and 1994, most of them with the [[Metropolitan Opera]], and most available on DVD.

Pavarotti married twice. He was married to his first wife Adua Veroni from 1961 to 2000 and they had three daughters: Lorenza, Cristina, and Giuliana. On 13 December 2003, he married his former personal assistant, Nicoletta Mantovani (born 1969), with whom he already had another daughter, Alice. Alice's twin brother, Riccardo, was [[stillborn]] after complications in January 2003.

Pavarotti's widow's lawyers, Giorgio Bernini and Anna Maria Bernini, and manager Terri Robson announced on 30 June 2008 that his family amicably settled his estate—€300 million ($474.2 million, including $15 million in U.S. assets). Pavarotti drafted two wills before his death: one divided his assets by Italian law, giving half to his second wife, Nicoletta Mantovani, and half to his four daughters; the second gave his U.S. holdings to Mantovani. The judge confirmed the compromise by the end of July 2008.
