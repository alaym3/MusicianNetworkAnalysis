Born and raised in [[College Park, Georgia]], she began performing as a child and became part of a traveling [[gospel choir]] at the age of ten. Monica rose to prominence after she signed with [[Rowdy Records]] in 1993 and released her debut album ''[[Miss Thang]]'' two years later. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including the global bestseller ''[[The Boy Is Mine (album)|The Boy Is Mine]]'' (1998) as well as the number-one albums ''[[After the Storm (Monica album)|After the Storm]]'' (2003), ''[[The Makings of Me]]'' (2006) and ''[[Still Standing (Monica album)|Still Standing]]'' (2010). Throughout her career, several of Monica's singles became number-one hits on the pop and R&B charts, including "[[Before You Walk Out of My Life]]", "[[Don't Take It Personal (Just One of Dem Days)]]", "[[Like This and Like That]]", "[[The Boy Is Mine (song)|The Boy Is Mine]]" (with [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]]), "[[The First Night]]", "[[Angel of Mine]]", "[[So Gone]]", and "[[Everything to Me (Monica song)|Everything to Me]]".

Monica's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in television series such as ''[[Living Single]]'' (1996), ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' (2001), and ''[[American Dreams]]'' (2003), and films including  ''[[Boys and Girls (2000 film)|Boys and Girls]]'' (2000), ''[[Love Song (2000 film)|Love Song]]'' (2000), and ''[[Pastor Brown]]'' (2009). A contributor to the NBC talent show ''[[The Voice (U.S. TV series)|The Voice]]'', in 2008, she appeared in the [[Peachtree TV]] reality show special ''Monica: The Single'' which tracked the recording of the song "[[Still Standing (Monica song)|Still Standing]]" along with her personal life and resulted in her own highly rated [[BET]] series ''[[Monica: Still Standing]]'', containing a similar concept.

===2000–2005: ''All Eyez on Me'' and ''After the Storm''===
In 2000, Monica made her film debut in the third drama from [[MTV Films]], ''Love Song'', as Camille Livingston, a young woman torn between the life her parents have planned for her and the world she experiences after meeting a musician from the wrong side of the tracks. The film debut the song "What My Heart Says" with the promotion of her third album ''[[All Eyez on Me (Monica album)|All Eyez on Me]]'' (2002). The film was released on April 30, 2002, and in ''[[Felicity (TV series)|Felicity]]'' (2001) and ''[[American Dreams]]'' (2003) playing Mary Wells, singing "My Guy".

In 2000, Monica contributed chorus vocals for "[[I've Got to Have It]]", a collaboration with [[Jermaine Dupri]] and rapper [[Nas]]. Released as the ''[[Big Momma's House]]'' theme song, the song saw minor success in the United States only. The following year, she released the [[Ric Wake]] production track "[[Just Another Girl (Monica song)|Just Another Girl]]", recorded for the ''[[Down to Earth (soundtrack)|Down to Earth]]'' soundtrack, as a single.
A year later, Monica channeled much of her heavily media-discussed experiences into the production of her third studio album, ''[[All Eyez on Me (Monica album)|All Eyez on Me]]'', her first release on mentor [[Clive Davis]] newly founded [[J Records]] label. "I just wanted to give the people back something that had personal passion, instead of just, 'Oh, let's dance to this record'," she said about the issues worked into the tracks.<ref name="Enquirer" /> The first single "[[All Eyez on Me (song)|All Eyez on Me]]", a [[Rodney Jerkins]]-produced [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]-[[dance music|dance]] track, saw minor to moderate success on the international charts but failed to enter the higher half of the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.<ref name="Enquirer" /> A follow-up song, "[[Too Hood]]", also got a lukewarm response and as a result, the album's tentative release was pushed back several times.<ref name="Enquirer" /> "I don't think people wanted to hear a big fun record from me, after knowing all the things that I had personally experienced," Monica second-guessed her new material which saw both early and heavy bootlegging via internet at that time.<ref name="Enquirer" />

After the Japan-wide release of ''All Eyez on Me'', Monica was asked to substantially reconstruct the record with a host of new producers, and as a result she re-entered recording studios to start work with songwriters [[Kanye West]], [[Jazze Pha]], [[Andre "mrDEYO" Deyo]], Bam & Ryan and Dupri – replacing [[executive producer]] [[Missy Elliott]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Jon |last=Wiederhorn |title=Missy, DMX, Tyrese To Give Monica's New LP Extra Oomph |work=[[VH1]] |url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1470858/20030331/monica.jhtml |date=March 31, 2003 |access-date=January 28, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001023244/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1470858/20030331/monica.jhtml |archive-date=October 1, 2007}}</ref> Finally released in June 2003, ''[[After the Storm (Monica album)|After the Storm]]'' debuted at number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]''`s Top R&B/Hip-Hop albums chart, and on top of the official ''Billboard'' 200, with sales of 186,000 copies emerging as Monica's first and only number-one album to date. It eventually received a [[gold certification]], and has sold over one million copies domestically.<ref name="about" /> Media reception of the CD was generally enthusiastic, with AllMusic saying the album "has all the assuredness and smart developments that should keep Monica's younger longtime followers behind her — all the while holding the ability to appeal to a wider spectrum of R&B and hip-hop fans."<ref>{{cite web|first=Andy|last=Kellman|title=Review: ''After the Storm'' – Monica|work=[[AllMusic]]|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r643951|pure_url=yes}}|access-date=May 31, 2007}}</ref> The album's lead single, Elliott-penned "[[So Gone]]", was one of Monica's biggest commercial successes in years, becoming her first top ten single since 1999's "Angel of Mine". In addition, it reached the top position of the ''Billboard'' R&B/Hip-Hop Tracks and [[Hot Dance Club Play]] charts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Beat Bonus: Gone Good to Go|date=June 20, 2003|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70487/chart-beat-bonus| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140922003446/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/70487/chart-beat-bonus| archive-date=2014-09-22|access-date=July 31, 2008}}</ref> Subsequently, ''After the Storm'' spawned another three singles, with final single "[[U Should've Known Better]]" reaching number nineteen on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=U Should've Known Better|url=http://acharts.us/song/491| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/http://acharts.us/song/491| archive-date=2021-10-21|work=A-Charts|access-date=August 10, 2008}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

==Influences==
Monica has said many times that [[Whitney Houston]] is her biggest inspiration and influence since childhood. Another big influence is [[Mary J. Blige]]. Other artists she looks up to are [[Betty Wright]], [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Anita Baker]].<ref>{{Citation|title=The Story of 'Miss Thang' Part 1-"Southside"|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2IUeL-zq49Q}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=Monica Arnold On Mary J. Blige |publisher=BET |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDcwt_ZYuKk |via=YouTube}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Monica's career slowed down in 1999 due to having problems in her relationship with ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems.<ref name="Enquirer" /> In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, who had died in an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998. Weems then, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide.<ref name="Enquirer" /> "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if I had said this, or if I would have done that,'" Monica said in an interview with ''The Cincinnati Enquirer'' the following year. "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change."<ref name="Enquirer" /> Monica briefly dated rapper, [[C-Murder]], until he was incarcerated for a murder in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2003/08/12/22-going-on-40-or-not/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/https://www.villagevoice.com/2003/08/12/22-going-on-40-or-not/| archive-date=2021-10-21|title=22 Going on 40 or Not|first=Allison|last=Stewart|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=August 12, 2003|access-date=September 6, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Monica met rapper [[Rocko (rapper)|Rodney "Rocko" Hill]], a former SWA officer and real estate manager, shortly after Weems's suicide, a time which she described as her "weakest".<ref name="vibe2006">{{cite book|first=Laura|last=Checkoway|title=Through The Fire|work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|via=[[Google Books]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8iYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA109|date=October 1, 2006|access-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref> While the couple soon began dating in the fall of the same year, they ended their relationship in 2004. A few months later, Monica and Hill revived their relationship and she became pregnant with their first child. On May 21, 2005, she gave birth to their first son, Rodney, who performs under "Rodneyy" as a SoundCloud rapper.<ref name="vibe2006" /><ref>{{cite web |last1=Angel |first1=H.D. |title=The Browser #5: A Q&A with Rodneyy |url=https://www.finals.blog/posts/The-Browser-5:-A-QandA-with-Rodneyy| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211021/https://www.finals.blog/posts/The-Browser-5:-A-QandA-with-Rodneyy| archive-date=2021-10-21 |website=Finals.blog |access-date=30 April 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Monica and Hill became engaged once again on Christmas Eve 2007, shortly before the birth of their second child on January 8, 2008.
