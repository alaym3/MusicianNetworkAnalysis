'''Powderfinger''' were an Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Brisbane]] in 1989. From 1992 until their break-up in 2010, the line-up consisted of vocalist [[Bernard Fanning]], guitarists [[Darren Middleton]] and [[Ian Haug]], bass guitarist [[John Collins (Australian musician)|John Collins]] and drummer [[Jon Coghill]]. The group's third studio album ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'' peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]] in September 1998. They followed with four more number-one studio albums in a row: ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'' (September 2000), ''[[Vulture Street (album)|Vulture Street]]'' (July 2003), ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]'' (June 2007) and ''[[Golden Rule (album)|Golden Rule]]'' (November 2009). Their Top&nbsp;Ten hit singles are "[[My Happiness (Powderfinger song)|My Happiness]]" (2000), "[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind]]" (2003) and "[[Lost and Running]]" (2007). Powderfinger earned a total of eighteen [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Awards]], making them the second-most awarded band behind [[Silverchair]]. Ten Powderfinger albums and DVDs certified multiple-[[music recording sales certification|platinum]], with ''Odyssey Number Five'' – their most successful album – achieving eightfold platinum certification for shipment of over 560,000 units.

After the release of their first DVD, ''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'' (September 2004), and the compilation album ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000]]'' (November 2004), the group announced a hiatus in 2005. The June 2007 announcement of a two-month-long nationwide tour with Silverchair, [[Across the Great Divide tour]], followed the release of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence''. Powderfinger were also involved in various philanthropic causes. In 2005, they performed at a [[WaveAid]] concert in [[Sydney]], to help raise funds for areas affected by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. Another performance at the [[Sydney Opera House]] in October 2007 raised funds for [[breast cancer awareness|breast cancer]] victims and their families. One aim of their Across the Great Divide Tour was to promote the efforts of [[Reconciliation Australia]], and awareness of the gap in life expectancy between [[Indigenous Australia|Indigenous]] and non-Indigenous children. In April 2010 Powderfinger announced that they would be breaking up after their [[Sunsets Farewell Tour]], declaring it would be their last, as they had musically said everything they wanted to say. On 13 November 2010, they played their last concert, signifying their disbandment. In November the following year, rock music journalist Dino Scatena and Powderfinger published a biography, ''Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band.''

On 23 May 2020, the band reformed for a one-off [[livestream]]ed charity performance, ''[[One Night Lonely]]''.<ref name="TheGuardian">{{Cite web |last=Stafford |first=Andrew |date=24 May 2020 |title=Powderfinger One Night Lonely review – first show in a decade a poignant reminder of what we've lost |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/24/powderfinger-one-night-lonely-review-first-show-in-a-decade-a-poignant-reminder-of-what-weve-lost |access-date=29 May 2020 |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

After completing secondary education, Collins and Haug attended the [[University of Queensland]], where the latter met [[Bernard Fanning]] in an economics class – and learned that Fanning had similar interests in music and could sing.<ref name="hindley-bios"/> Fanning took over the role of [[lead singer|lead vocals]] from Haug and also provided guitar and harmonica.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Late in 1990, Jon Coghill – another university student with Fanning and Haug – replaced Bishop on drums, which was described as a "mutual leaving".<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AutoF1-3"/> Bishop later worked in London-based bands based in [[London]], UK, before returning to Brisbane where he was a member of Moonjuice and then the Haymakers. Powderfinger's final line-up change was in 1992 with the addition of [[Darren Middleton]] (The Pirates) on guitar, keyboards, and backing vocals.<ref name="rockd"/><ref name="amg-bio"/> Powderfinger initially performed cover versions of other artists' songs, but gradually developed by writing and performing their own material.<ref name="rockd"/>

In August 1992, the group self-funded a seven-track [[Powderfinger (EP)|self-titled extended play]], also known as the ''Blue EP'', on their own Finger label, and the album was distributed by MDS.<ref name="h2g2" /><ref name="Nimmervoll"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> It was produced by Leroy Bath and Ian Taylor, and recorded at Broken Toys Studios, Brisbane.<ref name="SaveSkin"/> The EP has an early version of "[[Save Your Skin]]", co-written by Coghill, Collins, Haug, Middleton, and Fanning;<ref name="APRA Save"/> it was later expanded and released in July 1994 as a [[single (music)|single]] from their debut album, ''[[Parables for Wooden Ears]]''.<ref name="SaveSkin"/> Their second EP, ''[[Transfusion (EP)|Transfusion]]'', was issued in September 1993 and distributed by [[Polydor Records]].<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Nimmervoll"/> At that time, Simon McKenzie of ''Time Off'' noted they were "hoping the major label will put a bit of weight behind the disc, but it's not as though they've signed a record deal or anything".<ref name="McKenzie"/> McKenzie felt the EP showed they were "wanting to get heavier and louder for a long time, but is it also a reaction against the sixties tags they've been stuck with?".<ref name="McKenzie"/> The five tracks include "Reap What You Sow", which reached the No.&nbsp;1 spot on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Alternative Singles Chart]],<ref name="McPherson"/> replacing [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "[[Heart-Shaped Box]]".<ref name="hindleysite"/> The group recorded their first [[music video]], for "Reap What You Sow"; it was directed by David Barker, who subsequently directed their next seven videos.<ref name="db"/><ref name="Scatena191"/><ref name="ADG2007"/> After the EP's success, the group were signed by Polydor.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

In January 1994, Powderfinger performed on the [[Big Day Out]] Tour (see [[Big Day Out lineups by year#1994|1994 line-up]]).<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AutoF1-7"/> On 18 July that year, they released their debut studio album, ''Parables for Wooden Ears'', under Polydor. According to Australian rock music historian [[Ian McFarlane]], it "featured complex, meticulously crafted rock but was somewhat ponderous and sombre, which did little to fulfil the promise displayed on ''Transfusion''".<ref name="McFarlane"/> The album was produced by [[Tony Cohen]] ([[Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds]], [[The Cruel Sea (band)|The Cruel Sea]]),<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/> and Fanning later described it as the band's "dark dark days". It received limited radio coverage.<ref name="h2g2"/><ref name="hindleysite"/> Supporting the album's release, the band toured heavily, appearing at the [[Livid (festival)|Livid]] and [[Homebake]] music festivals.<ref name="AutoF1-6"/> Powderfinger supported United States visitors [[Pantera]] on that group's Driven Downunder Tour '94.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Another Australian support act on the tour was Newcastle-formed band [[Silverchair]].<ref name="Silverfinger"/> Three singles were released from Powderfinger's debut album – "[[Tail (song)|Tail]]", "[[Grave Concern]]", and "[[Save Your Skin]]" – but none appeared on the ARIA Singles Chart Top&nbsp;50.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="AutoF1-1"/> Following the album's release and lukewarm reception, in April 1995, the band recorded at Melbourne's Metropolis Studio with [[Magoo (Australian producer)|Lachlan "Magoo" Goold]] ([[Regurgitator]]) and in July released a five-track EP, ''[[Mr Kneebone]]''.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="Magoo"/>

The band's second studio album, ''[[Double Allergic]]'', was issued on 2 September 1996; it peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the ARIA Albums Chart and was certified triple&nbsp;[[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by ARIA for shipment of 210,000 units by 2007.<ref name="AutoF1-1"/><ref name="aria-accred-2007albums"/><ref name="AutoF1-8"/> It was co-produced by [[Tim Whitten]] and the group.<ref name="McFarlane"/><ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="DoubleAllergic"/> McFarlane felt this album was "more self-assured and textured [it] consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the [[alternative rock]] scene, alongside the likes of [[You Am I]], [[Spiderbait]], Silverchair, Regurgitator and Tumbleweed. [The album] was full of accessible, spirited rock".<ref name="McFarlane"/> Australian rock music journalist [[Ed Nimmervoll]] noted "[it] revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves. Powderfinger's reason to be is to create songs strong enough for the band and audience to play and hear months or years down the line".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> Four singles were released from the album – "[[Pick You Up]]", "[[D.A.F. (song)|D.A.F.]]", "[[Living Type]]", and "[[Take Me In (Powderfinger song)|Take Me In]]". "Take Me In" was released as a video single featuring several other music videos by the group. FasterLouder, a music review web site, recalled that "when ''Double Allergic'' was released in 1996, it showed the band were here for the long haul to become arguably one of the best of the decade".<ref name="AutoF1-9"/> In 1997 the album was issued in Canada and the group toured North America to promote it.<ref name="McFarlane"/>

===1998–2003: Critical acclaim and chart success===

On 7 September 1998, Powderfinger released their third studio album, ''[[Internationalist (album)|Internationalist]]'', which peaked at No.&nbsp;1 and spent 101 weeks in the Top&nbsp;50 of the ARIA Albums Chart; it was produced by [[Nick DiDia]] ([[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Pearl Jam]]).<ref name="Holmgren"/><ref name="AutoF1-1"/><ref name="Lawrence"/> [[AllMusic]]'s Jonathan Lewis had mixed feelings about the album. He was enchanted by its lead single, "[[The Day You Come]]", however "the rest of the album didn't measure up" except for "some fine tracks" in "Don't Wanna Be Left Out" and "Already Gone".<ref name="Lewis"/> Nevertheless, by 2007 the album had shipped over 350,000 copies and was certified five times platinum domestically,<ref name="db"/><ref name="aria-accred-2007albums"/> and had reached European audiences.<ref name="AutoF1-11"/> ''Internationalist'' was the first Powderfinger album to win any [[ARIA Music Awards]].<ref name=ARIAawardlist/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999|1999 ceremony]] it won "Album of the Year", "Best Rock Album", and "Best Cover Art" (by Kevin Wilkins), and "The Day You Come" won "Single of the Year".<ref name=ARIAawardlist/><ref name="AutoF1-12"/> "[[Passenger (Powderfinger song)|Passenger]]", another single from ''Internationalist'', was nominated for three additional categories in the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2000|following year]].<ref name=ARIAawardlist/> The band was both praised and criticised for their political views on ''Internationalist''. In a November 1998 interview with Benedict Watts of ''Juice Magazine'', Haug said that political messages in "The Day You Come" were not something they were just preaching about, but rather were something they saw as a responsibility.<ref name="AutoF1-13"/>

Powderfinger's fourth studio album, ''[[Odyssey Number Five]]'', was released on 4 September 2000, and also peaked at No.&nbsp;1.<ref name="AutoF1-1"/> ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Marc Weingarten provided a positive review and found the group "prove that there's still terrain left to be explored [in] guitar rock ... melancholy is the default mode ... [they] can be as prim as [[Travis (band)|Travis]] or as mock-grandiose as [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]".<ref name="Weingarten"/> However, Allmusic's Dean Carlson was more negative, seeing the album as "little more than a slightly off-base perspective into the world of mid-90s American [[grunge]]".<ref name="Carlson"/> ''Odyssey Number Five'' is Powderfinger's most commercially successful album, shipping 560,000 copies and certified eight&nbsp;times platinum by 2004.<ref name="aria-accred-2004albums" /> It also appeared on the [[Recording Industry Association of New Zealand|New Zealand]] Albums Chart at No.&nbsp;15.<ref name="NZ Charts"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2001]], the group won "Album of the Year", "Highest Selling Album", "Best Rock Album", "Best Cover Art" (by Wilkins), and "Best Group".<ref name=ARIAawardlist/><ref name="AutoF1-17"/>

Two of ''Odyssey Number Five''{{'}}s tracks featured on film soundtracks: "[[These Days (Powderfinger song)|These Days]]", written for ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'' (1999),<ref name="AutoF1-14"/> and "[[My Kind of Scene]]" in ''[[Mission: Impossible 2]]'' (2000).<ref name="AutoF1-15"/> Singles from the album are "My Kind of Scene", "[[My Happiness (Powderfinger song)|My Happiness]]", "[[Like a Dog (song)|Like a Dog]]", and the [[A-side and B-side#Double A-side|double A-side]] "[[The Metre/Waiting for the Sun|The Metre" / "Waiting for the Sun]]". "My Happiness", which peaked at No.&nbsp;4 in Australia and No.&nbsp;7 in New Zealand, is the group's highest-charting single in both countries.<ref name="AutoF1-1"/><ref name="NZ Charts"/> At the ARIA Awards ceremony, "My Happiness" won "Single of the Year",<ref name="AutoF1-18"/> and other songs were nominated in various categories.<ref name=ARIAawardlist/> Their tracks received votes from national radio station [[Triple J]]'s listeners on annual [[Triple J Hottest 100|Hottest 100]] lists: "These Days", "Already Gone", "[[Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray|Good-Day Ray]]", and "Passenger" were ranked in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1999|1999]], and "My Happiness" and "My Kind of Scene" in [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2000|2000]].<ref name="Triple J Hottest 100"/> In 2009, "These Days" was voted at No.&nbsp;21 and "My Happiness" at No.&nbsp;27 in the Hottest 100 of all time, placing them as second- and fourth-highest Australian tracks after the [[Hilltop Hoods]]' "[[The Nosebleed Section]]" and [[Hunters & Collectors]]' "[[Throw Your Arms Around Me]]", respectively.<ref name="AutoF1-19"/>

Powderfinger's ''[[Vulture Street (album)|Vulture Street]]'' was released on 4 July 2003, and became their third album to peak at No.&nbsp;1 in Australia,<ref name="AutoF1-1"/> while in New Zealand it reached No.&nbsp;17.<ref name="NZ Charts"/> Recorded in January and February 2003, it was named for the location of the band's first recording room in [[West End, Queensland|West End]], Brisbane. ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]''{{'}}s music critic [[Bernard Zuel]] approved of "a rawer, louder, but by no means unrefined, album" with "a real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger, but bears the mark of a superior intellect"; he felt it had Haug and Middleton "dominating in a way they had not since their 1994 debut" album.<ref name="SMGVulture"/> Simon Evans of [[musicOMH]] described the group as having "opted for a visceral live feel, adding a real punch to songs".<ref name="AutoF1-20"/> Middleton explained that the band's aim was to "get a sound in the songs that was reminiscent of things we grew up loving, which was [[David Bowie|Bowie]], [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] ... that sort of thing; all based in the 70s. We wanted to sonically have that as well, so it's a very old-school-sounding record. It's all the old amps, we used old guitars and [[tape recorder|recorded to tape]], of course. It's fairly organic in that sense".<ref name="Lawrence"/> ''Vulture Street'' won four ARIA Awards in [[ARIA Music Awards of 2003|2003]]: "Album of the Year", "Best Group", "Best Rock Album", and "Best Cover Art" (by Steven Gorrow, Revolution Design).<ref name=ARIAawardlist/> Singles issued from the album are: "[[(Baby I've Got You) On My Mind]]", "[[Since You've Been Gone (Powderfinger song)|Since You've Been Gone]]", "[[Love Your Way]]", and "[[Sunsets (song)|Sunsets]]". Tracks were also nominated for awards in 2003 and [[ARIA Music Awards of 2004|2004]].<ref name=ARIAawardlist/>

In September 2004 the group issued their first live album, ''[[These Days: Live in Concert]]'', initially as a [[compact disc|CD]], and followed in October with a two-disc [[DVD]]. One single, "[[Stumblin']]", which had appeared on ''Vulture Street'', was issued as a live version. In late October they released a compilation album, ''[[Fingerprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 1994–2000]]'', which included many of their singles from the first four albums as well as non-singles "Thrilloilogy" and "Belter", and a re-release of "These Days". "These Days", although never officially released as a single, was ranked at No.&nbsp;1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll of 1999.<ref name="Triple J Hottest 100"/> The album also included two new songs: "[[Bless My Soul]]" and "Process This", although only "Bless My Soul" was released as a single. Following the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], Powderfinger appeared at the [[WaveAid]] fundraising concert in January 2005 in Sydney, to raise funds for aid organisations working in the disaster-affected areas.<ref name="waveaid-review"/> Fanning, as a member of [[The Wrights (Australian band)|The Wrights]], sang lead vocals on "[[Evie (song)|Evie, part 2]]" at the concert.<ref name="AutoF1-21"/> The Wrights released a studio version in March as a single with some of the proceeds going to tsunami relief efforts.<ref name="AutoF1-21"/>

After the WaveAid concert, from early 2005, Powderfinger had a period of hiatus. During the separation, most band members pursued other musical projects; on the personal front, Haug and Middleton each had children, and Fanning met his future wife.<ref name="AutoF1-22"/><ref name="Christie"/> Middleton's side project, [[Drag (band)|Drag]], had issued an EP, ''[[Gas Food Lodging (EP)|Gas Food Lodging]]'', in 2002.<ref name="DragMSN"/> Zombos Reviews found the EP was "full of well-written jangly pop, and has some rather nice ballads".<ref name="Zombos"/> Their debut album, ''[[The Way Out (Drag album)|The Way Out]]'', recorded in March 2005 and released on 10 July,<ref name=AMOInterview/><ref name="DP"/> was "a tad disappointing [compared with the EP] ... mostly mid-tempo pop-rock songs, mixed with some slower, pretty ballads. Everything's tastefully arranged, and there's always nice melodies and harmonies".<ref name="Zombos"/> Collins and Haug formed [[The Predators (Australian band)|The Predators]] with Powderfinger's former drummer, Steven Bishop, now on drums and lead vocals. The group released a six-track EP, ''[[Pick Up the Pace]]'', in July 2006 and undertook a short tour around Australia.<ref name="AutoF1-23"/>

In October 2005 Fanning issued his debut solo album, ''[[Tea & Sympathy (Bernard Fanning album)|Tea & Sympathy]]'',<ref name=AMOTnS/><ref name="AutoF1-24"/> which reached No.&nbsp;1 in Australia and No.&nbsp;11 in New Zealand.<ref name="AUS Charts BF"/> At the [[ARIA Music Awards of 2006]], Fanning won in four categories including "Album of the Year" for ''Tea & Sympathy'' and "Best Video" for its lead single, "[[Wish You Well (Bernard Fanning song)|Wish You Well]]".<ref name="bernie-arias"/> "Wish You Well" was ranked at No.&nbsp;1 on the Triple J Hottest 100 poll in 2005.<ref name="AutoF1-26"/> At the end of 2006, Fanning toured in support of the album's release in the United Kingdom and North America; at its conclusion, Powderfinger resumed from their hiatus.<ref name="BF Solo"/><ref name="Connors"/> Fanning compared his solo work to Powderfinger recordings, saying, "when a problem came up in the studio, especially guitar-wise, I've always had Darren and Ian to call on. They could usually come up with something good. But I played all the guitar on it, and my abilities are fairly limited" and that "Powderfinger is my real job and I'm looking forward to doing it again".<ref name="Connors"/>

Powderfinger started recording their sixth studio album, ''[[Dream Days at the Hotel Existence]]'', in January 2007; it was released on 2 June. Debuting at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[ARIA Albums Chart]] – their fourth to do so consecutively<ref name="AutoF1-1"/> – it broke the Australian digital sales record with over 3,000 copies sold online.<ref name="AutoF1-27"/> In general, reviewers did not rate it as highly as its predecessor ''Vulture Street'', with Cameron Adams of the ''[[Herald Sun]]'' HiT describing it as "No radical reinvention, no huge change in direction ... In a word: consistent".<ref name="CAdams"/> Zuel described it as "Powderfinger's first dull album" but the band as "the biggest rock band in the country."<ref name="SMH-Dream Days"/> "[[Lost and Running]]", their first single for three years, had been issued in May, and reached No.&nbsp;5.<ref name="AutoF1-1"/> A second single, "[[I Don't Remember]]", appeared in August.

From mid-June 2009 Powderfinger worked with DiDia producing their seventh studio album, ''[[Golden Rule (album)|Golden Rule]]'', which was issued on 13 November. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the ARIA albums chart – becoming their fifth studio album in a row to do so.<ref name="AutoF1-1"/> The album's lead single, "[[All of the Dreamers]]", was released in September.<ref name="AutoF1-38"/><ref name="heraldsun.com.au"/> "Burn Your Name", the second single, followed in December. That same month the band performed at the 2009 [[Homebake]] festival after a 10-year absence.<ref name="Homebake2009"/> In late January they toured on the 2010 Big Day Out. The third single from the album, "Sail the Widest Stretch", appeared in April.<ref name="AutoF1-39"/>

Also in April 2010, Powderfinger announced that after 21 years the group would disband following their [[Sunsets Farewell Tour]] in September and October that year:<ref name="breakup"/><ref name="AutoF1-40"/><ref name="powderfinger.com"/>

{{quote|text=With the completion of our last album, ''Golden Rule'', we feel that we have said all that we want to say as a musical group.

Coghill told ''Australian Times'' that the final tour is "going to be great fun, but it's also going to be sad".<ref name="AutoF1-41"/> He confirmed that he had no plans to start a new band or for a solo project. Instead he intended to finish his degree, "[o]nce I'm done with that, I might put the feelers out and see what's happening. I don't think I'd be doing anything solo, but I might look to join other bands, just to have a chance to keep playing. I'm just not keen to be off touring the world anymore".<ref name="AutoF1-41"/> Powderfinger played their final show at the River Stage in Brisbane on 13 November 2010 in front of 10,000 fans; the last song they performed was "These Days".<ref name="AutoF1-42"/> On 25 January 2011 the band issued a previously unreleased track, "I'm on Your Side", as a fundraiser for the Premier's Flood Appeal as a result of [[2010–2011 Queensland floods|major flooding in Queensland]] from December the previous year into January. The song was available via the band's website with all proceeds going towards the cause. On 8 November 2011, the group released a second compilation album, ''[[Footprints: The Best of Powderfinger, 2001–2011]]'', containing two new tracks. There was also a 2-disc release, ''Fingerprints & Footprints – The Ultimate Collection'', combining both ''Fingerprints'' and ''Footprints'' in one set.<ref name="AutoF1-43"/> Also in November, Dino Scatena, together with the band, published a biography, ''Footprints: the inside story of Australia's best loved band''.<ref name="Scatena2"/> Scatena, a rock music journalist, had started writing the book in October of the previous year, during the Sunsets Farewell Tour.<ref name="Scatena2"/>

===2010–present: Afterwards===
Former Powderfinger member Bernard Fanning worked on his second solo album ''[[Departures (album)|Departures]]'' during late 2012 in Los Angeles, with [[Joe Chiccarelli]] producing.<ref name="McCabe2012"/> It was released in June the following year and peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the ARIA Albums Chart.<ref name="AUSCharts Fanning"/> Middleton had relocated to Melbourne and worked with Red Door Sounds' Paul Annison – producer of [[Children Collide]]'s album ''[[Monument (Children Collide album)|Monument]]'' (April 2012). In December that year Middleton revealed that "I’m halfway through a new record".<ref name="Egging"/> Middleton's album, ''Translations'', was released independently in November 2013.<ref name="Translations"/> Around the same time Coghill was working as a journalist on the Gold Coast, while Collins was "developing business projects in Queensland".<ref name="Zuel 13 Nov"/>

In January 2013 Haug produced the second album, ''Sins of a Li'l Later Kiss'', by Brisbane-based folk duo Cole and Van Dijk.<ref name="ColeVanDijk"/> He then joined [[The Church (band)|the Church]], replacing [[Marty Willson-Piper]], and featured on their 2014 album ''[[Further/Deeper]]''.

On 23 May 2020, Powderfinger reformed for a one off, live-streamed [[YouTube]] charity performance titled, ''[[One Night Lonely]]'' with all proceeds going to [[Beyond Blue]] and Support Act.<ref name="TheGuardian"/> On 25 May, an EP of the performance was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/au/album/one-night-lonely/1514512509|title=One Night Lonely|website=Apple Music|date=25 May 2020|access-date=29 May 2020}}</ref>

On 31 August 2020, Powderfinger confirmed the release of a compilation album of unreleased songs titled ''[[Unreleased (1998–2010)]]'', released on 27 November 2020. It was preceded by the single "Day by Day", released on 18 September.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/doublej/music-reads/music-news/powderfinger-new-album-2020/12605624|title=Powderfinger will release a new album of unreleased songs in 2020|website=ABC|date=31 August 2020 |access-date=4 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=brownypaul|date=2020-09-17|title=Powderfinger Drop First New Song in 10 Years 'Day By Day'|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2020/09/18/powderfinger-new-song-day-by-day/|access-date=2020-09-17|website=Wall of Sound|language=en-US}}</ref>

On 13 November 2020, Powderfinger released "Daybreak", the second single preceding the release of the album.

== Musical style ==
Powderfinger's musical style includes hard rock and alternative music and, according to McFarlane, "the band made its mark with an earthy, blues-based sound that combined soaring, 1970s-influenced riff-rock with 1990s studio technology. With the added textures of folk, country and a soulful groove, the band was able to head in any direction".<ref name="McFarlane"/> Nimmervoll acclaimed them as "one of Australia's most popular radio-friendly rock bands" which "produced music the rest of Australia embraced".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/> McFarlane was partially disappointed with their debut 1994 album ''Parables for Wooden Ears'' compared to their earlier EP ''Transfusion''.<ref name="McFarlane"/> Their 1996 album, ''Double Allergic'', was "more self-assured and textured" and "consolidated the band's position at the forefront of the alternative rock scene".<ref name="McFarlane"/> It "revealed a significant shift towards accessible rock songs rooted in melodic grooves" according to Nimmervoll.<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

In a November 2007 interview with [[Paul Cashmere]] of the website Undercover, Middleton stated that a couple of songs they had initially written for ''Vulture Street'' "were just too ''Odyssey Number Five'' based", and that the first track, "Rockin' Rocks", was "probably the start of where we were heading with the album".<ref name="cashmere-interview"/> Cashmere stated that the album was "the toughest [he has] heard Powderfinger sound".<ref name="cashmere-interview"/> Zuel reviewed two of Powderfinger's more recent albums, and described ''Vulture Street'' as "a rawer, louder" album in comparison to ''Odyssey Number Five''; it highlighted Fanning's "talent as a lyricist" and he stated that it featured guitarists Haug and Middleton "dominating in a way they haven't since their 1994 debut".<ref name="SMGVulture"/> Zuel also stated that there is a "real energy here that has some connections to early Powderfinger," and described "On My Mind" as having "[[AC/DC]] meatiness", and "Love Your Way" as "acoustic tumbling into weaving [[Led Zeppelin|Zeppelin]] lines".<ref name="SMGVulture"/> In his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'', Zuel described it as "[having] high-gloss and muscular framework," and stated that that was what "American radio considers serious rock."<ref name="SMH-Dream Days"/>

{{quote|1=Compared with the relatively lean, agile sound they've perfected up to now, this is Powderfinger as the footballer who in the off-season spends his time in the gym and emerges buff and beefy. The problem is he has bulk but has traded in his nimbleness.|2=Bernard Zuel|3=''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 1 June 2007<ref name="SMH-Dream Days" />}}

Clayton Bolger of [[AllMusic]] stated in his review of ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' that Powderfinger "largely revisit the sound of their ''Internationalist'' album, leaving behind much of the glam and swagger of 2003's ''Vulture Street''".<ref name="Bolger"/> He commented on Fanning's "commanding and distinctive vocals", the "twin-guitar attack" of Middleton and Haug, Collins' "innovative basslines", and the "powerhouse drum work" of Coghill.<ref name="Bolger"/> Nimmervoll described ''Golden Rule'' as "Powderfinger back to its essence. They’d experimented with the sound, tried different things with the songwriting process and recorded in America with different producers. [It] was recorded at home, the band reunited with American Nick DiDia, who had previously worked with the band during the "classic" era, producing ''Internationalist'', ''Odyssey Number 5'' and ''Vulture Street''. They also wrote the songs as a team, with Bernard responsible for the bulk of the lyrics. The album was recorded in the same spirit, as close to the live sound as a studio album could be".<ref name="Nimmervoll"/>

Powderfinger were active in supporting causes or opposing actions taken in charitable, philanthropic, disaster, and political circumstances. In 1996, when [[Crowded House]] decided to break up, they organised a farewell concert as a charity event for the [[Sydney Children's Hospital]] on 24 November.<ref name="AutoF1-44"/> They approached Powderfinger and fellow Australian acts [[Custard (band)|Custard]] and [[You Am I]] to also appear on the steps of the [[Sydney Opera House]].<ref name="AutoF1-45"/> The charity event, which was recorded and later released as a live album titled ''[[Farewell to the World]]'', was claimed to have the largest Australian live concert audience, with estimates of between 100,000 and 250,000 people.<ref name="AutoF1-46"/><ref name="sss"/> In the wake of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]], Powderfinger performed at the [[WaveAid]] fund-raising concert in Sydney in January 2005.<ref name="waveaid-review"/> The disaster killed more than 225,000 people from 11 countries in the area.<ref name="AutoF1-47"/> The total profit from the funds raised from ticket sales and donations was A$2,300,000, however most of this money was spent in the administrative stream with little reaching those affected.<ref name="AutoF1-48"/>

The song "[[Black Tears]]" from the album ''Dream Days at the Hotel Existence'' originally had the lyric "An island watchhouse bed, a black man's lying dead",<ref name="blacktears-perthnow"/> which sparked fears that it might prejudice the trial of the former Senior Sergeant [[Chris Hurley (police officer)|Chris Hurley]] over the [[2004 Palm Island death in custody]] case.<ref name="couriermail"/> The band claimed that the song's lyrics primarily dealt with the climbing of [[Uluru]] by tourists despite requests from the Indigenous people of the area to respect their sacred sites and not climb.<ref name="AutoF1-49"/> The original version of the song was retracted from the album, and replaced with an alternative version with the criticised material removed.<ref name="AutoF1-50"/> The legal team for Hurley, who was charged with manslaughter over the death of [[Mulrunji]] in 2004, had referred the song to the [[Attorney-General of Queensland]], [[Kerry Shine]], in their attempt at altering the track.<ref name="theaustralian"/> One of Hurley's lawyers, Glen Cranny, stated that "the content and proposed timing of the song's release raises some serious concerns regarding Mr Hurley's trial".<ref name="couriermail"/> Powderfinger's band manager, [[Paul Piticco]], stated that Fanning had confirmed that a line in the song was related to the case. However, he added that the lyric in question could refer to "a watchhouse in [[The Bahamas]] or something".<ref name="theaustralian"/>

In June 2007, Powderfinger and Silverchair announced their combined Across the Great Divide Tour,<ref name="AutoF1-51"/> which promoted [[Reconciliation Australia]], a foundation helping to improve the welfare of the Indigenous people of Australia, and to "show [that] both bands are behind the idea of reconciliation".<ref name="AutoF1-51"/> Reconciliation Australia increased the awareness of the 17-year difference in life expectancy between the Indigenous and non-Indigenous children of Australia.<ref name="AutoF1-52"/> In October that year, during [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]], Powderfinger performed another concert on the steps of the Sydney Opera House.<ref name="AutoF1-57"/> This concert was for invitees only – breast cancer patients, survivors, and their families were eligible to attend.<ref name="AutoF1-58"/> Powderfinger performed alongside Silverchair, [[Missy Higgins]], and other artists to an audience of 700.<ref name="AutoF1-59"/> The concert was filmed and later broadcast as a [[The MAX Sessions|''MAX Session'']] on [[Foxtel]] channel MAX on 3 November.<ref name="AutoF1-60"/>

For the Sunsets Farewell Tour in September 2010, the band promoted another Indigenous cause, the Yalari organisation.<ref name="AutoF1-61"/> The organisation provides Indigenous children with opportunities to get a proper education. In January 2011, following the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods|Queensland flood disaster]], [undercover.fm] reported that Powderfinger would not reform for a benefit concert, but the band instead donated a never-before released track, "I'm on Your Side", to help raise money for the victims.<ref name="AutoF1-62"/>
