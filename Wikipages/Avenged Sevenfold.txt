'''Avenged Sevenfold''' (sometimes abbreviated as '''A7X''') is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Huntington Beach, California]], formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist [[M. Shadows]], rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist [[Synyster Gates]], bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]].

Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957202/avenged-sevenfold-returns-with-nightmare-after-drummers-death|title = Avenged Sevenfold Returns with 'Nightmare' After Drummer's Death|date = July 26, 2010|access-date = November 8, 2014|website = Billboard|last = Harding|first = Cortney}}</ref> The band emerged with a [[metalcore]] sound on their debut album ''[[Sounding the Seventh Trumpet]]'' and continued this sound through their second album ''[[Waking the Fallen]]''. However, the band's style had evolved by the group's third album and first major label release, ''[[City of Evil]]'', into a heavy metal and [[hard rock]] style. The band continued to explore new sounds with its [[Avenged Sevenfold (album)|self-titled]] release and enjoyed continued mainstream success before their drummer, [[The Rev|James "The Rev" Sullivan]], died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged Sevenfold continued on with the help of drummer [[Mike Portnoy]] ([[Dream Theater]]), and released and toured in support of their fifth album ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]'' in 2010, which debuted on the top spot of the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], their first number one debut.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/957051/avenged-sevenfold-scores-first-no-1-album-on-billboard-200|title = Avenged Sevenfold Scores First No. 1 Album on Billboard 200|date = August 4, 2010|access-date = November 8, 2014|website = Billboard|last = Caulfield|first = Keith}}</ref>

In 2011 drummer Arin Ilejay joined the band on tours and recording. The band's sixth studio album ''[[Hail to the King (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Hail to the King]]'', which was released in 2013, marked the only Avenged Sevenfold album featuring Ilejay. ''Hail to the King'' charted as number 1 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the UK Albums chart, as well as the Finnish, Brazilian, Canadian, and Irish charts. In late 2014, Ilejay left the band, and was replaced by former [[Bad Religion]] drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]], but the lineup change was not announced to the public until 2015. The band then surprise-released their seventh studio album titled ''[[The Stage (album)|The Stage]]'' on October 28, 2016, which debuted as number 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in the US. ''The Stage'' is their first [[Concept album|conceptual album]] and it marked another stylistic change for the band, moving towards a [[progressive metal]] sound.

To date, Avenged Sevenfold has released seven studio albums, one live album/DVD, two [[Compilation album|compilation]] albums and eighteen singles and have sold over 8 million albums worldwide,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avengedsevenfold.com/news/brooks-wackerman-joins-avenged-sevenfold |title=Brooks Wackerman Joins Avenged Sevenfold.  |publisher=Avenged Sevenfold |date=November 5, 2015 |access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> and their records have received numerous certification awards, including five platinum album awards from their home country's institution ([[RIAA]]). They have also created four original songs for the ''[[Call of Duty (series)|Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' series, all of which were compiled together in the 2018 EP ''[[Black Reign (EP)|Black Reign]]''. The band were ranked No. 47 on ''[[Loudwire]]'s'' list of Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/top-metal-bands-of-all-time/|title=Top 50 Metal Bands of All Time|website=Loudwire|access-date=January 18, 2018}}</ref>

Avenged Sevenfold's first creative output was a three-track-[[Demo (music)|demo]] recorded in early 1999.<ref name="Demo1">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Avenged-Sevenfold-Demo/release/11287316 |title= Avenged Sevenfold – Demo (1999, CDr) |publisher=discogs.com |access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref><ref name="Demo2">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Avenged-Sevenfold-Demo/release/6685467 |title= Avenged Sevenfold – Demo (2000, CDr) |publisher=discogs.com |access-date=June 9, 2021}}</ref> In early 2000, they were asked by Sadistic Records to contribute to two compilations.<ref name="IntoObscurity" /> To that end, they recorded two new songs and released them along with the previously recorded songs on a second demo.<ref name="Demo2" /> They sent this demo to the Belgian label [[Good Life Recordings]] and were subsequently signed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avenged7fold.com:80/interview2.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202141923/http://www.avenged7fold.com/interview2.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=December 2, 2001 |title=Interview 2 |access-date=November 25, 2018 }}</ref> Afterwards, the band participated in another two compilation albums, their label's ''GoodLife 4'' and Novocaine Records' ''Scrape III'' compilations.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.avenged7fold.com/releases.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010628150555/http://www.avenged7fold.com:80/releases.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 28, 2001 |title=Releases |access-date=June 9, 2021 }}</ref> Around this time, Matt Wendt left for college and Justin Meacham, the previous bassist of [[Suburban Legends]], joined Avenged Sevenfold.

Initially, the band's debut album ''[[Sounding the Seventh Trumpet]]'' consisted almost entirely of a [[metalcore]] sound. However, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in "Streets", which shows a [[punk rock]] style, and "[[Warmness on the Soul]]", which is a piano [[ballad]].<ref>[http://www.globaldomination.se/reviews/avenged-sevenfold-sounding-the-seventh-trumpet Avenged Sevenfold: Sounding the Seventh Trumpet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025011706/http://www.globaldomination.se/reviews/avenged-sevenfold-sounding-the-seventh-trumpet |date=October 25, 2008 }} ''Global Domination''. December 20, 2007.</ref> On ''[[Waking the Fallen]]'', the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to [[hardcore punk|hardcore]].<ref name=About /> In the band's DVD ''All Excess'', producer [[Andrew Murdock]] explained this transition: "When I met the band after ''Sounding the Seventh Trumpet'' had come out before they had recorded ''Waking the Fallen'', M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'."

On Avenged Sevenfold's third album ''[[City of Evil]]'', the band chose to outright abandon the [[metalcore]] genre,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1503793/20050608/avenged_sevenfold.jhtml|title=Avenged Sevenfold Salute Dimebag, Shun Metalcore on Evil|last=Weiderhorn|first=Joe|date=June 9, 2005|publisher=MTV}}</ref> creating a sound consistent with hard rock and heavy metal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moderndrummer.com/site/2009/12/james-the-rev-sullivan/#_ |title=James 'The Rev' Sullivan |publisher=[[Modern Drummer]]}}</ref> Avenged Sevenfold's [[Avenged Sevenfold (album)|self-titled]] album experiments with an even wider array of musical genres than that from ''City of Evil'', most notably in "[[Dear God (Avenged Sevenfold song)|Dear God]]", which shows a [[country music|country]] style and "A Little Piece of Heaven", which is circled within the influence of [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show tunes, using primarily [[brass]] instruments and stringed [[orchestra]] to take over most of the role of the [[Lead guitar|lead]] and [[rhythm guitar]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/avenged-sevenfold/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329025419/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/avenged-sevenfold/biography |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 29, 2012 |title=Avenged Sevenfold Biography |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref> ''[[Nightmare (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Nightmare]]'' contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called "Fiction", [[progressive metal]]-oriented track "Save Me" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on "God Hates Us". The band's sixth studio album ''[[Hail to the King (Avenged Sevenfold album)|Hail to the King]]'' shows more of a [[classic metal]] sound and a [[riff]]-oriented approach. On their newest album ''[[The Stage (album)|The Stage]]'', the band explores further into [[progressive metal]],<ref name="teamrock.com"/> blending it with elements of [[thrash metal]].
