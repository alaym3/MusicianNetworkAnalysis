==Life and career==
===Early life===
Agneta Åse Fältskog was born in [[Jönköping]], Sweden on 5 April 1950.<ref>{{cite book |last= Magnus Palm |first=Carl |access-date=7 March 2019 |date= 2009 |title=Bright Lights, Dark Shadows: The Real Story of ABBA |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CILUDgAAQBAJ&q=%C3%85se+Agneta+F%C3%A4ltskog&pg=PT158 |location= London |publisher= Omnibus Press|page= 131|isbn= 9780857120571|quote =...Agneta Åse Fältskog was born on April 5, 1950.

Fältskog wrote her first song at the age of six, entitled "Två små troll" ("Two Small Trolls").<ref name="se">[[:sv:Agnetha Fältskog|Agnetha Fältskog – Wikipedia]] ([[Swedish language|SWE]])</ref> In 1958, she began taking piano lessons, and also sang in a local church choir.<ref name="Agnetha" /> In early 1960, Fältskog formed a musical trio, the Cambers, with her friends Lena Johansson and Elisabeth Strub. They performed locally in minor venues and soon dissolved due to a lack of engagements.<ref name="Agnetha" /> At age 15, Fältskog decided to leave school and pursue a career.<ref name="Agnetha" />

Fältskog cites [[Connie Francis]], [[Marianne Faithfull]], [[Aretha Franklin]] and [[Lesley Gore]] as her strongest musical influences.<ref name="Agnetha" />

===Career development in Sweden (1966–1971)===
Fältskog worked as a telephonist for a car firm while performing with a local [[Dance music|dance]] band, headed by Bernt Enghardt.<ref name="Agnetha" /> The band soon became so popular that she had to make a choice between her job and her musical career. She continued singing with the Bernt Enghardt band for two years.<ref name="Agnetha" /> During that time, Fältskog broke up with her boyfriend Björn Lilja; this event inspired her to write a song, "Jag var så kär" ("I Was So in Love"), that soon brought her to media prominence.<ref name="Agnetha" /><ref name="AF" /> At that time, Karl Gerhard Lundkvist, a relative of one of the band's members, retired from his successful [[rock and roll]] career and began working as a record producer at Cupol Records. Enghardt sent him a demo recording of the band, but Lundkvist only showed interest in Fältskog and her song.<ref name="AF" /> She was worried because he was not interested in the band and they were not to be included on the record. However, she decided to accept the offer, and signed a [[recording contract]] with [[CBS Records International|Cupol Records]].<ref name="Agnetha" />

Her self-penned début single "Jag var så kär" was recorded on 16 October 1967 and released through Cupol Records the following month. It topped the Swedish Chart on 28 January 1968 and sold more than 80,000 copies.<ref name="Agnetha" /> She also submitted the song "Försonade" ("Reconciled") to [[Melodifestivalen]], the Swedish preliminary for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], but it was not selected for the final.<ref name="AF" /> Fältskog developed a career as one of Sweden's most popular pop music artists, participating in a television special about Swedish composer Jules Sylvain in 1969.<ref name="Räkna De Lyckliga Stunderna Blott">{{cite web|url=https://www.oppetarkiv.se/video/1125673/|title=Räkna de lyckliga stunderna blott|date=16 August 1969|publisher=www.oppetarkiv.se|access-date=29 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030040921/https://www.oppetarkiv.se/video/1125673/|archive-date=30 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The same year, she released the single "Zigenarvän" ("Gypsy Friend") about a young girl attending a [[Romani people|Gypsy]] wedding and falling in love with the bride's brother. Its release coincided with a heated debate about Gypsies in the Swedish media, and Fältskog was accused of deliberately trying to make money out of the situation by writing the song.<ref name="se" />

Fältskog's success continued throughout the late 1960s. She met German songwriter/producer Dieter Zimmermann, to whom she became engaged.<ref name="Agnetha" /> Her albums thus reached the German charts, and Zimmermann promised her she would achieve great success in Germany.<ref name="Agnetha" /> However, when she went there and met with record producers, the venture was not productive; Fältskog refused to meet the demands of the producers, describing their chosen material as "horrible".<ref name="Agnetha" /> She soon ended her engagement to Zimmermann and returned to Sweden.<ref name="Agnetha" />

In 1970, she released "Om tårar vore guld" ("If Tears Were Gold"). The Danish composer Per Hviid claimed that she used 22 bars from his composition "Tema" ("Theme"), even though it  was written in the 1950s and had never been recorded. The case dragged on until 1977, when a settlement was reached and Fältskog paid the Danish musician [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 5,000.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1972, Fältskog portrayed [[Mary Magdalene]] in the Swedish production of the international hit musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref name="AF" />

===First marriage and years with ABBA (1971–1982)===
Fältskog met [[Björn Ulvaeus]], a member of the [[Hootenanny Singers]], for the first time in 1968, and then again in 1969.<ref name="AF" /> Her relationship with Ulvaeus, as well as her friendship with [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] and [[Benny Andersson]], with whom Ulvaeus had already written songs, eventually led to the formation of [[ABBA]]. Fältskog and Ulvaeus married on 6 July 1971 in the village of Verum, with Andersson playing the organ at their wedding.<ref name="Agnetha" /> Their first child, [[Linda Ulvaeus|Linda Elin Ulvaeus]], was born on 23 February 1973, and their son [[Christian Ulvaeus|Peter Christian Ulvaeus]] on 4 December 1977.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} After seven years of marriage, the couple decided to separate in late 1978, and filed for divorce in January 1979. The divorce was finalised in July 1980. Both Fältskog and Ulvaeus agreed not to let their failed marriage interfere with their responsibilities with ABBA.<ref name="Agnetha" /><ref name="AF" /> The failure of their marriage inspired Ulvaeus to write the lyrics of "[[The Winner Takes It All]]".<ref name="Agnetha" /><ref name="AF" />
[[File:Abba 28011977 15 200.jpg|thumb|left|Fältskog at the opening concert of ABBA's European and Australian Tour in Oslo, 28 January 1977.]]

As a member of ABBA, Fältskog was also known as ''Anna'' in some countries.<ref>{{cite book |title=Abba The Book |url=https://archive.org/details/abbabook0000poti |url-access=registration |year= 2000|publisher= Aurum Oress Ltd|isbn=1-85410-698-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/abbabook0000poti/page/9 9]}}</ref> In 1975, during the same period as her bandmate [[Anni-Frid Lyngstad]] recorded her Swedish number one album ''[[Frida ensam]]'', Fältskog recorded and produced her solo album ''[[Elva kvinnor i ett hus]]''. These albums were both recorded between sessions and promotion for the ABBA albums ''[[Waterloo (album)|Waterloo]]'' and ''[[ABBA (album)|ABBA]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Fältskog's album spent 53 weeks on the Swedish album chart (longer than any of ABBA's albums), but failed to reach the Top 10, peaking at No.11. It contained three further [[Svensktoppen]] entries for Fältskog: her Swedish-language version of ABBA's "SOS" (also No. 4 on the single sales chart); "Tack För En Underbar Vanlig Dag"; and "Doktorn!". With the exception of "SOS", all the songs had lyrics by Bosse Carlgren and music by Fältskog herself. The creation of the album had been underway since 1972, when Fältskog started writing the songs, but it was delayed because of the work with ABBA and her pregnancy.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In 1974, Fältskog and Carlgren had agreed on a concept for the album; it should consist of 12 songs, each sung by 12 different female characters living in the same apartment building. However, in the end only 11 songs were featured on the album, and the concept wasn't fully developed. Fältskog possesses a [[coloratura soprano]] voice. She is noted for her [[operatic]] abilities, and her range expands from D3 to Eb6. 

[[File:Agnetha Fältskog 1979.jpg|thumb|Fältskog in 1979]]
Between the years 1968 and 1980, Fältskog had a total of 18 entries on the Svensktoppen radio chart, starting with the debut single "Jag Var Så Kär" in January 1968 (peak position No. 1) and ending with "När Du Tar Mig I Din Famn" ("When You Take Me in Your Arms") from the compilation ''[[Tio år med Agnetha]]'' in January 1980 (peak position No. 1). These 18 entries, most of which were composed or co-written by Fältskog herself, spent a total of 139 weeks on the chart during this time, with the biggest hit being 1970's "[[Om tårar vore guld]]" (No. 1, 15 weeks).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Fältskog also recorded the Swedish Christmas album ''[[Nu tändas tusen juleljus (Agnetha Fältskog & Linda Ulvaeus album)|Nu tändas tusen juleljus]]'' with daughter [[Linda Ulvaeus]] which peaked at No. 6 on the Swedish album chart in December 1981.

Fältskog participated in [[Melodifestivalen]] again, albeit only as a composer. In 1981, she wrote the ballad "Men Natten Är Vår" ("But the Night Is Ours") with lyrics by [[Ingela Forsman]], but instead of performing the song in the contest herself, she chose new talent Kicki Moberg. The song placed 9th out of 10. The single, which Fältskog produced in the Polar Studios with the same musicians as on contemporary ABBA recordings, was backed with the Swedish version of "I'm Still Alive", entitled "Här Är Mitt Liv" ("Here Is My Life"), a song which she herself had performed in its English version (lyrics by ex-husband Björn Ulvaeus) during ABBA's 1979 world tour.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Moberg's recording of the song remains the only version to have been officially released to date.<ref>Carl Magnus Palm (2001) ''Bright Lights – Dark Shadows'', Omnibus Press UK, {{ISBN|978-0-7119-8389-2}}</ref>

Fältskog sang solo parts in the following ABBA songs: "[[Disillusion (ABBA song)|Disillusion]]" (the only ABBA song to have been written by her, lyrics by Björn), "I Am Just A Girl", "[[Hasta Mañana]]", "[[Dance (While the Music Still Goes On)]]", "[[SOS (ABBA song)|SOS]]", "[[I've Been Waiting For You (ABBA song)|I've Been Waiting For You]]", "[[When I Kissed The Teacher]]", "[[My Love, My Life (song)|My Love, My Life]]", "[[Take A Chance On Me]]", "[[The Name of the Game (ABBA song)|The Name Of The Game]]", "[[Move On (ABBA song)|Move On]]", "[[Thank You For The Music]]", "Get On The Carousel", "[[Chiquitita]]", "Lovelight", "[[Don't Shut Me Down]]", "[[As Good As New]]", "Kisses Of Fire", "Dream World", "[[Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)]]", "The Way Old Friends Do", "[[The Winner Takes It All]]", "[[Happy New Year (song)|Happy New Year]]", "[[Lay All Your Love On Me]]", "[[Head Over Heels (ABBA song)|Head Over Heels]]", "[[One Of Us (ABBA song)|One Of Us]]", "Soldiers", "[[Slipping Through My Fingers]]", "[[Just Like That (song)|Just Like That]]" (never officially released in its entirety by the group), "I Am The City", "[[Under Attack]]" and "[[The Day Before You Came]]".

===Solo career development (1982–1988)===
Although no official announcement was made, ABBA effectively disbanded in late 1982 to early 1983. At the end of 1982 Fältskog duetted with Swedish singer (and former ABBA backing vocalist) [[Tomas Ledin]] on a song called "[[Never Again (Agnetha song)|Never Again]]", which became a Top Five hit in Sweden, Norway, Belgium, and South America.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The song was also released in a Spanish-language version, entitled "Ya Nunca Más". In the summer of the same year, Fältskog had a leading role in the Swedish movie ''Raskenstam''.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In May 1983, Fältskog released her first post-ABBA solo album, ''[[Wrap Your Arms Around Me]]'', produced by [[Mike Chapman]]. The album became a moderate hit in North America and Australia, but reached the higher regions of the charts across Europe, including No. 1 in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Belgium, and Denmark (where it became the biggest-selling album of the year), top 5 in Germany, The Netherlands and France and No. 18 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19830612/7502/|title=1983 Top 40 Official Albums Chart UK Archive 18th June 1983|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=8 January 2014}}</ref> The album achieved sales of 1.5 million copies in the first year.<ref>Faltskog, Agnetha & Ahman, Brita (1997) 'As I Am: ABBA Before & Beyond', Virgin Publishing, p.91</ref> Two singles from the album became hits in continental Europe: "[[The Heat Is On (Agnetha song)|The Heat Is On]]" became a No. 1 hit in Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, and Belgium and No. 2 in The Netherlands and Germany.

Fältskog's next studio album, ''[[Eyes Of A Woman]]'', produced by [[Eric Stewart]] of [[10cc]], was released in March 1985. "She is quite content to grace the works of various other lesser mortals with her immaculate, sugar-sweet voice," wrote Barry McIlheney in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. The album sold well in parts of Europe, peaking at No. 2 in Sweden and reaching the Top 20 in Norway and Belgium, but scraped into the UK Top 40 just for one week.<ref>[https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/19850428/7502/ 4 May 1985 Top 40 Official Albums Chart UK Archive].

In 1986, Fältskog recorded another duet, "[[The Way You Are (Fältskog and Håkansson song)|The Way You Are]]", with Swedish singer [[Ola Håkansson]], which became another No. 1 hit in Sweden and Norway.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In early 1987, Fältskog recorded the album ''[[Kom följ med i vår karusell]]'' ('Come Join Us On Our Carousel') with her son Christian. The album contained songs for children and was sung in Swedish. For the album Agnetha recorded duets with her son and a children's choir. In 1988, it was nominated for Swedish music prize [[Grammis]] in a category 'Barn' (For Children).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grammis.se/nominated_year/1988/page/2/|title=1988 – 2/2 – Grammisgalan|website=Grammisgalan|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref>

In the summer of 1987, Fältskog travelled to [[Malibu, California]], to record her fourth post-ABBA solo album, ''[[I Stand Alone (Agnetha Fältskog album)|I Stand Alone]]'', produced by [[Peter Cetera]] (formerly of the band [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]) and [[Bruce Gaitsch]], who had collaborated on [[Madonna]]'s ''[[La Isla Bonita]]''. Released in November of that year, ''I Stand Alone'' was a minor hit in Europe, except in Sweden where it spent eight weeks at No. 1 and became the best-selling album of 1988.<ref>[http://www.abbaofficial.com/agnetha_after_abba.html Agnetha Today].

The single "[[I Wasn't the One (Who Said Goodbye)|I Wasn't The One (Who Said Goodbye)]]", on which Fältskog duetted with Peter Cetera, was released primarily in North America, and became her second solo single to chart on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at No. 93.<ref name="billboard.com"/> It was also a Top 20 [[Billboard Adult Contemporary|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] hit. The track (along with "The Last Time" as "La Última Vez") was also recorded in Spanish for the Latin American market as "Yo No Fui Quién Dijo Adiós". Fältskog refused to promote the album in major TV shows in West Germany, but she made a promotional visit to London in February 1988, appearing on the ''Terry Wogan Show''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===Hiatus from recording (1988–2004)===
Following the release of ''I Stand Alone'', Fältskog had a 17-year hiatus from the music industry, during which she made few public appearances and devoted much of her time to [[astrology]], [[yoga]] and [[horse riding]] at her isolated country house in [[Ekerö]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/679508.stm Abba's Agnetha 'plans comeback'] News.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 20 December 2017.</ref>

In 1990, Fältskog married Swedish surgeon Tomas Sonnenfeld, but the couple divorced in 1993.<ref>[http://agnetha.net/AGNETHA.html Agnetha page] at agnetha.net, accessed 18 October 2011</ref>

In 1994, Fältskog's mother died by suicide by jumping from her [[Jönköping]] apartment balcony. Fältskog's resulting [[Depression (mood)|depression]] worsened a year later when her father died.<ref name="AgExp"/>

In 1997, Fältskog started a relationship with a Dutch [[forklift]] driver, Gert van der Graaf. After Fältskog decided to terminate the relationship in 1999, he stalked her further at her mansion, resulting in a court issuing Van der Graaf with a [[restraining order]] and deporting him to the Netherlands in 2000. Returning close to her home in 2003, he was arrested and then banned from entering Sweden.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3015660.stm Abba stalker arrested in Sweden] News.bbc.co.uk. Retrieved 20 December 2017.</ref> In 2005, the ban order from Sweden ran out, and within months Van der Graaf was again sighted near Fältskog's estate in Ekerö.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mg.co.za/article/2005-10-24-stalker-targets-former-abba-singer|title=Stalker targets former ABBA member Agnetha Fältskog |publisher=mg.co.za |date=24 October 2005 |access-date=31 January 2010}}</ref>

In 1996, her autobiography ''Som jag är'' was published in Swedish (and in English the following year titled ''As I Am''), followed by several compilation CDs of her Swedish and English recordings, including one called ''My Love, My Life'' for which Fältskog picked out the music herself. Fans welcomed the autobiography. The book was updated in 1998 and released worldwide via Virgin Publishing, selling over 50,000 copies.

===Return to music and selected public appearances (2004–present)===
[[File:Agnetha Fältskog 2008 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Fältskog in 2008|240x240px|left]]
In April 2004, Fältskog released a new single, "[[If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind]]" (a cover of the song originally recorded by [[Cilla Black]]). It peaked at No. 2 in Sweden and became Fältskog's highest charting UK single to date, reaching No.11.<ref>[http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Agnetha+F%E4ltskog&titel=If+I+Thought+You%27d+Ever+Change+Your+Mind&cat=s Agnetha Fältskog – If I Thought You'd Ever Change Your Mind]. swedishcharts.com.

She may be cheating a trifle by including no original material on this collection of 1960s covers, but if anyone can do justice to the likes of "[[Sealed with a Kiss]]", it's her. The soaring sentimentality evokes [[Cilla Black]] and [[Sandie Shaw]] in their mini-skirted pomp, and I don't say that lightly."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/apr/16/popandrock.shopping|title=Agnetha Fältskog, My Colouring Book |author=Sullivan, Caroline |date=16 April 2004 |access-date=18 July 2013 |work=The Guardian|location=London}}</ref> The release attracted media attention across Europe, but Fältskog staunchly refused to be involved in any extensive promotion of the album.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A second single release from the album, "[[When You Walk in the Room]]", peaked at No.11 in Sweden and entered the UK Top 40 at No. 34 (which was still higher than any of her UK singles in the 1980s).<ref>[https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/singles-chart/20040620/7501/ 26 June 2004 Top 40 Official Singles Chart UK Archive]. Official Charts (26 June 2004). Retrieved on 19 April 2014.</ref> "[[Sometimes When I'm Dreaming]]", originally recorded by [[Art Garfunkel]], failed to be released as the third single.

Shortly after this release, for the 2004 semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], staged in Istanbul 30 years after ABBA had won the contest in Brighton, Fältskog appeared briefly in a special comedy video made for the interval act, entitled "Our Last Video." All four members of the group appeared briefly in cameo roles, as did the singer and actress [[Cher]] and comedian [[Rik Mayall]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In 2004, Fältskog was nominated for ''Best Nordic Artist'' at the Nordic Music Awards, and at Christmas of that year she gave an extensive interview (her first for many years) which was filmed by Swedish TV.<ref>{{YouTube|MPLPy2Eb2dQ|Agnetha FäItskog – Interview from December 2004, PART 1/4}} (8 November 2006). Retrieved on 19 April 2014.</ref> Around the same time, [[Sony Music]] released a lavishly produced 6-CD [[boxed set]] comprising Fältskog's Swedish solo career (mostly before ABBA), with five original solo albums: 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, and her 1975 album recorded and released during her time with ABBA – plus an additional compilation disc with bonus tracks.

In 2005, Fältskog appeared with her former bandmates at the opening of the ''Mamma Mia!'' musical in Stockholm, and together with ex-husband Björn, also attended the final show in January 2007.

In October 2008, a new compilation album, ''[[My Very Best]]'', was released in Sweden. The double CD contains both Swedish (CD 1) and English-language hits (CD 2) from her whole solo career, from 1967 to 2004. It reached No. 4 on the Swedish album chart and was certified gold within its first week of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdesk.se/pressroom/sonybmg/pressrelease/view/agnetha-i-guld-243937 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206091704/http://www.newsdesk.se/pressroom/sonybmg/pressrelease/view/agnetha-i-guld-243937 |archive-date=6 December 2008 |title=Agnetha Fältskog säljer guld |publisher=Newsdesk.se |date=9 October 2008 |access-date=31 January 2010}}</ref>

In February 2010, ABBA World, an extensive multimillion-Pound (in monetary value) exhibition, debuted at London's Earls Court and included an extensive interview with Fältskog filmed in Sweden the previous summer.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} For the exhibition's Melbourne launch, she recorded a light-hearted opening film together with former ABBA colleague Benny Andersson, shot in Stockholm in June 2010.<ref>{{Youtube|sw-yqIkgJbI|Benny's and Agnetha's video for the ABBAWORLD Melbourne launch.}}</ref>

In May 2013, Fältskog released a new album called '[[A (Agnetha Fältskog album)|A]]', produced by [[Jörgen Elofsson]] and Peter Nordahl. In the UK, the first single, "When You Really Loved Someone", had previously been released for download on 11 March, with the accompanying video also released on the same day. In Germany, the first single was "The One Who Loves You Now", and it was also released for download on 11 March 2013. The album includes a duet with [[Gary Barlow]] of [[Take That]], called "[[I Should've Followed You Home]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/9933274/Abbas-Agnetha-Faltskog-Could-the-girl-with-the-golden-hair-get-lucky-at-last.html|title=Abba's Agnetha Faltskog: Could the girl with the golden hair get lucky at last?|last=Langley|first=William|journal=Daily Telegraph|date=17 March 2013|access-date=5 March 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>

In June 2013, officials from Universal Records in the Netherlands said that 600,000 copies of 'A' were sold in the first two months after its release. The album managed Top 5 placings in many territories, including Sweden, Norway, Germany, Denmark, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Belgium, Austria, New Zealand and Australia.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It charted at No. 6 in the United Kingdom (her highest ever placing in that territory), and a few weeks after its release a TV special made by the [[BBC]] helped the album reach the No. 6 position in the UK album chart for a second time. The first single from the album to be released in the US, "[[Dance Your Pain Away]]", was released on 28 May 2013. The digital single included two new mixes by Smash Mode.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} "Dance Your Pain Away" was released internationally as a single on 15 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.agnetha.com/news/dance-your-pain-away-released-july-15th|title=Dance Your Pain Away – Released July 15th|date=15 June 2013|publisher=Agnetha.com|access-date=24 June 2013}}</ref>

On 17 May 2013, Fältskog was awarded the SKAP 2013 Kai Gullmar Memorial Award at the Stockholm release party for 'A'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/66439128 |title=Video: Agnetha Fältskog receives the SKAP 2013 Kai Gullmar Memorial Award |publisher=SKAP |date=17 May 2013 |access-date=23 May 2013}}</ref>

On 12 November 2013, Fältskog sang live on stage for the first time in 25 years at the BBC [[Children in Need Rocks 2013]] concert in London; she sang a duet with [[Gary Barlow]], the organiser of the event, performing the single "[[I Should've Followed You Home]]" from Agnetha's album '[[A (Agnetha Fältskog album)|A]]'.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-24922899|title=Stars perform at Children in Need Rocks concert|date=13 November 2013|access-date=13 November 2013|work=BBC News}}</ref>

On 18 November 2013, in order to promote the song, a video for "I Should've Followed You Home" was shot the same day as the release of the single itself. Although the single was released in most countries in November 2013, its release in the United Kingdom was held over. She also won Best Female Album – 6th Annual Scandipop 2014, and was nominated for the German 2014 ECHO award in the Artist Rock/Pop International category.

In April 2016, a new biography of Fältskog, by Daniel Ward, ''Agnetha Fältskog – The Girl With The Golden Hair'', was published in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://fonthillmedia.com/epages/a72b332e-5c82-4e84-ad34-4c5316ee7a6b.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=/Shops/a72b332e-5c82-4e84-ad34-4c5316ee7a6b/Products/978-1-78155-521-7|title=Agnetha Fältskog: The Girl with the Golden Hair|website=fonthillmedia.com|access-date=16 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425072113/http://fonthillmedia.com/epages/a72b332e-5c82-4e84-ad34-4c5316ee7a6b.sf/en_GB/?ObjectPath=%2FShops%2Fa72b332e-5c82-4e84-ad34-4c5316ee7a6b%2FProducts%2F978-1-78155-521-7|archive-date=25 April 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Fältskog reunited with ABBA in 2018.

==Personal life==
Fältskog had a [[fear of flying]], which worsened during ABBA's 1979 American tour, when the band's plane, heading to [[Boston]], Massachusetts, was short of fuel, hit a [[tornado]] and performed an emergency landing. Fältskog said in 2013 that she still needed therapy to deal with the fear. During her solo career years, Fältskog would always travel by bus, and experienced a bus accident on a Swedish motorway in 1983.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Agnetha Fältskog Archives |url=http://www.agnethaarchives.com/articles/Aftonbladet181083.htm |access-date=30 September 2019 |agency=Aftonbladet |publisher=Magnus Janson |date=18 October 1983}}</ref>

Fältskog has reportedly suffered from [[stage fright]], [[Ochlophobia|fear of crowds and open spaces]], and [[Acrophobia|fear of heights]], amongst others.<ref name="AgExp"/>

Fältskog's split from Ulvaeus in 1979 greatly affected her and she needed therapy afterwards. Her second marriage in 1990 to Tomas Sonnenfeld was held privately, and only became public knowledge when they divorced three years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/music/1380694/ABBA-members-what-happened-to-Agnetha-Faltskog-after-ABBA-evg|title=ABBA members: What happened to Agnetha Fältskog after ABBA?|first=Jenny|last=Desborough|date=13 January 2021|website=Express.co.uk}}</ref> Her mother's suicide in 1994 and her father's death the following year were also kept private.<ref name ="maha">[https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/is-abbas-agnetha-faltskog-finally-ready-to-forgive-her-bandmates-for-years-of-misery-6880291.html Is Abba's Agnetha Faltskog finally ready to forgive her bandmates for years of misery?] Standard.co.uk.
