'''ITNO''', or '''In the Name Of''', was a British record label owned by [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and founded by singer [[Lily Allen]], which existed from 2011 to 2014.

==Background==
Allen started work on the label in 2009, when she announced that she would take a break from recording her own music, and that she wanted to set up her own label as she was disillusioned with the music industry. She said: "I'm setting up a record label at the moment, getting involved in lots of different things. I think things need to change in the music industry and we need to rethink a lot of stuff."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/lily-allens-record-company-now-backed-by-sony_1195986|title=Lily Allen - Lily Allen's Record Company Now Backed By Sony|accessdate=5 June 2011|date=20 January 2011|work=[[Contactmusic.com]]}}</ref>

The label, titled In the Name Of, was launched in 2011.
