== Band name ==
Heaven Shall Burn's name was inspired by an album by the black metal band [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], which is entitled ''[[Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered]]''.

{{pull quote|
It’s not that we’re huge Marduk fans, but we liked the name. It sounds a bit provoking and so people ask us again and again for the meaning behind our name. [..] We use the term "heaven" as a [[metaphor]] for some kind of a fake paradise that people create in their heads. Some people close their eyes and don’t see the truth surrounding them. So this kind of fake heaven should burn. Some people might think that our name is an [[antireligion|anti-religious]] statement, but it isn’t.
