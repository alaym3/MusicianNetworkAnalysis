==Music career==

===2006–2007: ''Vatten och bröd''===
In March 2006, Maggio released her debut single "[[Dumpa mig]]" (Dump Me); the video for the single soon became the hit of the week on TV stations like [[ZTV]].

Maggio's debut album is called ''[[Vatten och bröd]]'' (Water and Bread). The lyrics and music were written by Stefan Gräslund, except for the rap verse in "Vi har, vi har" (We Have, We Have), which was written by rapper Kristoffer Malmsten (known as LKM).  "I started writing in English when I was really young, but I just wasn’t good enough." she said in 2016, "I was mimicking things I’d heard and I wasn’t able to find my own identity."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/in-conversation-veronica-maggio|title=In Conversation: Veronica Maggio|date=13 July 2016|access-date=19 July 2016|last=De Wolfe|first=Danielle|work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]}}</ref>

In 2010 Maggio worked with [[Petter (rapper)|Petter]] on his new single "Längesen" (Long Time ago) from his album "En räddare i nöden" (A saviour when in need).

===2011–2012: ''Satan i gatan''===
In 2011 she released the album ''[[Satan i gatan]]'', on which she collaborated with amongst others [[Christian Walz]] and [[Markus Krunegård]]. The album was a success and reached the 1st place in both Swedish and Norwegian music charts, as did the single "[[Jag kommer]]".
During the summer and autumn of 2011, Maggio toured through Denmark, Norway and Sweden,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv4play.se/program/nyhetsmorgon?title=veronica_maggio_om_sin_jattesucce&video_id=1632834 |title=TV4 Nyhetsmorgon söndag |date=8 May 2011 |access-date=24 January 2013}}</ref> and again in 2012 at [[Ruisrock]]festival in Finland.

She released her fifth album, ''Den första är alltid gratis'' (The First One's Always Free) in 2016.   A critic describes it as "another pop triumph, combining pacing, urgent melodies, with uplifting, hook-heavy choruses."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/in-conversation-veronica-maggio|title=In Conversation: Veronica Maggio|access-date=19 July 2016}}</ref> Maggio said in an interview:  "I really like the happy/sad combination." "There’s a lot of melancholy in it, but there’s also something euphoric… I tended to write darker lyrics because it was always nighttime. I was still in the process of playing live lots, so I sort of surprised myself."

In 2018, Maggio released the single, ''20 Questions'' which was featured in ''Bergmans Reliquarium'', a short film homage to [[Ingmar Bergman]].

Maggio released an EP titled ''Fiender är tråkigt'' (Enemies are Boring) in June 2019 which consisted of the first five songs of her sixth album of the same name. The full album featuring 10 songs total was released on 27 September 2019.

It's the soundtrack to so many of my memories. I've always been so impressed with Veronica's way with words. I could never write in swedish the way she can.
