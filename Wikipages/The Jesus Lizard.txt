'''The Jesus Lizard''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1987 in [[Austin, Texas]] and based in [[Chicago, Illinois]].  They were "a leading [[noise rock]] band in the American independent [[underground music|underground]]…[who] turned out a series of independent records filled with scathing, disembowelling, guitar-driven pseudo-[[industrial rock|industrial]] noise, all of which received positive reviews in underground music publications and heavy [[Campus radio|college-radio]] play."<ref name=all>{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/the-jesus-lizard-p13331|title=The Jesus Lizard – AllMusic|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|access-date=September 5, 2012}}</ref>

After a brief run as a recording-only project based in Austin, founding vocalist [[David Yow]], bassist [[David Wm. Sims]], and guitarist [[Duane Denison]] relocated to [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] in 1989, where they found kindred spirits in recording engineer [[Steve Albini]] and [[Touch and Go Records]].  With the addition of drummer [[Mac McNeilly]], they began performing live, eventually attracting an international audience with their powerful live show.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Montoro|first=Philip|title=The Jesus Lizard live and in color|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2017/12/11/the-jesus-lizard-live-and-in-color|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Chicago Reader|language=en}}</ref> Drummer [[Jim Kimball]] replaced McNeilly late in 1996, and was himself replaced by Brendan Murphy two years later, with McNeilly returning to drums for their reunion shows years later.

Despite releasing a [[Puss/Oh, the Guilt|split single]] with leading alt-rockers [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and signing to [[Capitol Records]], the band failed to find commercial success amid the alternative rock explosion of the 1990s and disbanded in 1999. Their reunion tour ten years later garnered positive responses from audiences and critics. The band performed another reunion tour in 2017 and 2019.

==History==
===Formation and Touch & Go years (1987–1994)===
The band began in Austin, Texas, when guitarist [[Duane Denison]] asked [[David Yow]], formerly of [[Scratch Acid]], to play bass on some songs he wanted to record.  Yow suggested that he sing and have former Scratch Acid bassist [[David Wm. Sims]] play bass instead.  The resultant group took its name from a common nickname for the [[Basiliscus basiliscus|basilisk]], a type of lizard that can run on water.  The trio rehearsed several times in Austin with a drum machine.  Yow and Sims moved to Chicago in 1988, and Denison followed the next year.

Their first EP, ''[[Pure (1989 album)|Pure]]'', was recorded by Albini and released by Touch & Go in 1989.  It is the only record by the band that uses a drum machine.  Drummer [[Mac McNeilly]], formerly of [[Phantom 309 (band)|Phantom 309]], was recruited and the band played its first live show on July 1, 1989.  Albini recorded the band's next four albums – ''[[Head (The Jesus Lizard album)|Head]]'', ''[[Goat (album)|Goat]]'', ''[[Liar (The Jesus Lizard album)|Liar]]'', and ''[[Down (The Jesus Lizard album)|Down]]''.  During this era the group also released a live record, ''[[Show (The Jesus Lizard album)|Show]]'', and a split single with Nirvana, ''[[Puss/Oh, the Guilt]]''.

===Capitol years and breakup (1995–1999)===
[[File:Jesus Lizard.jpg|thumb|right|The Jesus Lizard performing at The Garage at London circa 1998]]
The band signed to [[Capitol Records]] in 1995, recording the song "Panic in Cicero" for the ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'' soundtrack and making appearances at [[Lollapalooza]] shortly thereafter. Impressed by his work on [[The Melvins]]' ''[[Stoner Witch]]'' album, the band hired producer [[Garth Richardson]] to record their next record, ''[[Shot (album)|Shot]]'', the following year.  While rumors that Albini refused to work with the band due to their involvement with a major label persisted, both Albini and the group have stated this to be false.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dodds |first=Ben |url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2009/10/the-jesus-lizard-touch-and-go-reissues.html |title=The Jesus Lizard: Touch and Go Reissues :: Music :: Reviews :: Paste |publisher=Pastemagazine.com |access-date=October 20, 2011}}</ref>

McNeilly left the band in late 1996,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejesuslizard.net/conchron.htm |title=The Jesus Lizard Concert Chronology |publisher=Thejesuslizard.net |access-date=October 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202341/http://www.thejesuslizard.net/conchron.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref> citing exhaustion from touring and the desire to spend more time with his family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejesuslizard.net/inter/gabe.html |title=Interviews & Reviews of the Jesus Lizard |publisher=Thejesuslizard.net |access-date=October 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202348/http://www.thejesuslizard.net/inter/gabe.html |archive-date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref>  He was replaced by [[Jim Kimball]], of [[Mule (band)|Mule]] and Denison's side project, [[The Denison/Kimball Trio]].

After more heavy touring the following year, this lineup recorded 1998's [[The Jesus Lizard (EP)|self-titled EP]], their only record whose title is not a four-letter word, on [[Jetset Records]]. The EP featured production and engineering by [[Andy Gill]] of [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]], [[John Cale]], and [[Jim O'Rourke (musician)|Jim O'Rourke]].  Later that year, the band released the album ''[[Blue (The Jesus Lizard album)|Blue]]'', also recorded by Gill.  A departure, the record explored their experimental instincts previously hinted at on earlier songs like "Happy Bunny Goes Fluff-Fluff Along" and "White Hole".

In August 1998 Kimball left the group<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejesuslizard.net/news.htm |title=the latest in the Jesus Lizard News |publisher=Thejesuslizard.net |access-date=October 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202439/http://www.thejesuslizard.net/news.htm |archive-date=October 8, 2011 }}</ref> and was replaced by Chicago-based drummer Brendan Murphy, formerly of the [[Wesley Willis Fiasco]]. They embarked on several more months of heavy touring, playing the final gig of their initial career at the [[Umeå Open]] festival in [[Umeå]], [[Sweden]], on March 27, 1999.  After being dropped from Capitol Records mid-contract, the band announced its split the following June.

===Post-breakup (2000–2007)===
In 2000, Touch & Go issued ''[[Bang (The Jesus Lizard album)|Bang]]'', a CD of 7" tracks and rarities. The members remained musically active: Denison began performing with [[Tomahawk (band)|Tomahawk]], continued to play with Kimball in [[The Denison/Kimball Trio]], and backed [[Hank Williams III]] on tour.  He also formed [[U.S.S.A.]] with ex-[[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] bassist [[Paul Barker]] in 2006.  McNeilly played drums in [[P.W. Long]]'s Reelfoot recording "Push Me Again",  and continued to play along with his wife in their band Mouse.  He recorded with [[Steve Albini]] in February 2007 for Denison's Fuzz label mate Greg Garing.

In 2006, Yow and Sims reformed Scratch Acid, along with original members [[Rey Washam]] (also of [[Rapeman]], Ministry) and Brett Bradford (also of Sangre de Toro) for the Touch & Go Records 25th Anniversary Festival in Chicago. A week before the Touch & Go Festival, the reunited Scratch Acid played to a sold-out crowd at [[Emo's]] in their hometown of Austin.  Sims relocated to [[New York City]], began working as an accountant, and maintained his solo project Dangerpuss. Denison relocated to Nashville. Yow moved to [[Los Angeles]], working in graphic design for an advertising agency and joining the band [[Qui (band)|Qui]],<ref>{{Cite web|last1=September 5th|first1=Dave Kerr|last2=2007|title=Songs in the Qui of David Yow|url=http://drownedinsound.com/in_depth/2349818-songs-in-the-qui-of-david-yow|access-date=2020-07-18|website=DrownedInSound|language=en}}</ref> before pursuing an acting career<ref>{{Cite web|last1=correspondent|first1=About Jay Horton Jay Horton is a longtime|last2=Music|first2=Jack-of-All-Arts-Coverage|last3=film|last4=theater|last5=food|last6=television|last7=books|last8=dance|last9=Teams|first9=College Football Special|title=David Yow Is Done With Music, but His World Remains a Stage|url=https://www.wweek.com/music/2016/05/10/david-yow-is-done-with-music-but-his-world-remains-a-stage/|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Willamette Week|language=en-US}}</ref> and briefly joining [[Flipper (band)|Flipper]] on vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|title=Flipper Reuniting, Enlist Jesus Lizard's David Yow|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/60635-flipper-reuniting-enlist-jesus-lizards-david-yow/|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Pitchfork|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-08-24|title=Ep064: David Yow (Jesus Lizard, Scratch Acid, Actor)|url=https://www.radioneutron.com/2015/08/24/ep064-david-yow-jesus-lizard-scratch-acid-actor/|access-date=2020-07-18|website=Conan Neutron's Protonic Reversal|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Reunion tour (2008–2010)===
The Jesus Lizard reformed in 2008 with McNeilly drumming, and began playing concerts the next year. These shows included appearances at the [[Pitchfork Music Festival]] in Chicago, and [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] music festivals in England and New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/Events/JesusLizardLondon.php|title=The Jesus Lizard + Harvey Milk + Grails|publisher=Atpfestival.com|access-date=September 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/jesus_lizards_mac_mcneilly|title=Conversations: The Jesus Lizard's Mac McNeilly|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|author=Vish Khanna|date=December 2009|access-date=September 5, 2012}}</ref>  On October 6, all of the band's Touch & Go studio albums were re-released with improved sound and bonus tracks.

===Post-reunion tour (2010–2016)===
In August 2011 MVD released ''Club'', a concert DVD and double LP of the band's Nashville performance at Exit/In from the 2009 tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockshockpop.com/forums/content.php?1797-Jesus-Lizard-The-Club |title=Jesus Lizard, The - Club |publisher=Rock! Shock! Pop! |access-date=October 20, 2011}}</ref>

In 2013, Yow released ''[[Tonight You Look Like a Spider]]'', a solo album that had been in production for almost 15 years on [[Joyful Noise Recordings]].  The album was released in a limited edition, where the vinyl album was delivered inside of a concrete monolith, instead of a normal record sleeve.  Yow stated that he'd been inspired to do the album by [[Mike Patton]], and described his compositional process by stating,  "I rented a saxophone for 2 months, I borrowed some guitars and some drums, I rummaged through the kitchen, I squeezed a fat cat, I poked and prodded and ended up with my very own music."<ref name="joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal">{{cite web|title=How My Solo Album Happened|url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/how-my-solo-album-happened/|publisher=Joyfulnoiserecordings.com|access-date=May 8, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2013, the Jesus Lizard was set to play at the All Tomorrow's Parties event Release the Bats in Melbourne, Australia. They cancelled this show due to 'unforeseen circumstances'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.undertheradar.co.nz/news/6478/ATP-Annnounce-Release-The-Bats-Melbourne---The-Breeders-The-Jesus-Lizard--More.utr |title=ATP Announce Release The Bats Melbourne - The Breeders, The Jesus Lizard + More - Music News at Undertheradar |publisher=Undertheradar.co.nz |date=2013-03-20 |access-date=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/the-jesus-lizard-cancel-australian-tour-and-atps-release-the-bats/ |title=The Jesus Lizard Cancel Australian Tour And ATP's Release The Bats - Music News, Reviews, Interviews and Culture |magazine=Music Feeds |access-date=2014-08-13}}</ref>

===Second reunion (2017–present)===
In September 2017, the band announced their second reunion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treblezine.com/36912-day-for-night-festival-lineup-jesus-lizard-nine-inch-nails/|title=The Jesus Lizard playing first show in eight years at Day for Night festival|publisher=Treble|date=September 20, 2017|access-date=September 20, 2017}}</ref> The band undertook their first tour in eight years that December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://newnoisemagazine.com/jesus-lizard-announce-first-tour-8-years/|title=The Jesus Lizard Announce First Tour In 8 Years!|publisher=New Noise Magazine|date=October 4, 2017|access-date=October 4, 2017}}</ref>  They went on a tour in September 2018 and would play [[Riot Fest]] 2018 in Chicago that same month.

==Sound, influence, and legacy==
Their music featured a scathing mix of piercing guitar, machine-like drums, propulsive bass guitar, and psychotic vocals.  Denison's stinging guitar often served more as texture or coloring than as a rhythm or lead instrument, while the [[rhythm section]]'s stops and starts were simultaneously precise and brutal. David Sprague suggests that "Yow's disjointed [[couplet]]s" are reminiscent of a "[[preacher]] [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]]."<ref>Sprague, David. "[http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=jesus_lizard Jesus Lizard]". Trouser Press, 2007. Retrieved on March 4, 2009.</ref>  Albini typically kept vocals "low in the mix," or much less prominent than was typical of rock and roll recordings. In ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', [[Michael Azerrad]] writes that "on the Jesus Lizard albums Albini recorded, singer David Yow sounds like a [[kidnapping|kidnap]] victim trying to howl through the [[duct tape]] over his mouth; the effect is horrific."<ref>Azerrad, Michael. ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]''. Little Brown and Company, 2002. {{ISBN|0-316-78753-1}}</ref> Yow doesn't consider himself a singer in the usual sense, but rather, thinks of himself as a vocal stylist. While appreciated as a unique vocalist, Yow was more often cited for his confrontational antics on-stage, often leaping into the crowd or taking off his clothes. He was also known to lick members of the crowd while climbing all over them and sometimes striking up conversation mid-song.
