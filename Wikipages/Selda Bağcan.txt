'''Selda Bağcan''' ({{IPA-tr|ˈselda ˈbaːdʒan|IPA}}; born December 14, 1948) is a [[Turkey|Turkish]] [[folk music|folk]] singer-songwriter, guitarist, and music producer.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/selda-mn0000331793/biography | title=Selda | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | accessdate=April 8, 2015 | author=Karaege, Vefik}}</ref>

==Early life==

Selda Bağcan was born in 1948 in the western Turkish town of [[Muğla]]. Her father was a veterinarian medician of [[Turks in North Macedonia|Macedonian Turk]] origin from the town of [[Bitola]] and her mother was a teacher of [[Crimean Tatars in Turkey|Crimean Tatar]] origin.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bağcan|first=Selda|title=Kendi kaleminden Selda Bağcan|url=http://www.seldabagcan.com.tr/kendi-kaleminden-selda-bagcan|accessdate=2013-02-01|work=Selda Bagcan official website|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725021337/http://seldabagcan.com.tr/kendi-kaleminden-selda-bagcan|archivedate=2013-07-25}}</ref> She had two older brothers named Savaş and Sezer, and a younger brother named Serter was born when Selda was two years old.<ref name="ses">{{cite web|url=http://www.sozcu.com.tr/2016/yazarlar/soner-yalcin/cumhuriyetin-guclu-sesi-bagcanlar-1036647/|title=Cumhuriyet'in güçlü sesi: BAĞCANLAR|last=Yalçın|first=Soner|date=2016|accessdate=2017-06-06|work=Sozcu}}</ref> The family relocated to [[Van, Turkey|Van]] shortly after Serter was born, where Selda spent most of her childhood. Her father, Selim, was a music enthusiast who played the [[saxophone]] and the [[flute]], and he encouraged all his children to start playing instruments from a very young age. Selda herself started to play the [[mandolin]] when she was five.<ref name="ses" /> The family spent many evenings playing music together, under the direction of Selim.

Upon Selim's unexpected death from [[typhoid fever]] in 1957, the rest of the family moved to [[Ankara]] to be close to the mother's sister.<ref name="radikal">{{cite web|last=Özcan|first=Nazan|title=İsyanın 40 yıllık sesi|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/hayat/isyanin_40_yillik_sesi-1153160|date=2013-09-30|accessdate=2013-09-30|work=Radikal}}</ref> Selda continued to play the mandolin, and picked up the guitar as well, during her middle school and high school years.<ref name="biyografi">{{cite web|last=Bağcan|first=Selda|title=Biyografi|url=http://www.seldabagcan.com.tr/selda-bagcan-biyografi|accessdate=2013-02-01|work=Selda Bağcan official website|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905122244/http://www.seldabagcan.com.tr/selda-bagcan-biyografi|archivedate=2012-09-05}}</ref> At first she sang English, Italian and Spanish songs she picked up on the radio, but during her years as a student at [[Ankara University]]'s [[engineering physics]] department, she started to develop an interest in traditional Turkish folk music, inspired by early [[Anatolian rock]] singers like [[Cem Karaca]], [[Barış Manço]] and [[Fikret Kızılok]], as well as the folk singer Saniye Can.<ref name="interview">{{cite web|last=Bahar|first=Sonat|title=Kürtçe açılımı ilk ben yaptım|url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Ekler/Pazar/Roportaj/2010/01/17/kurtce_acilimi_ilk_ben_yaptim |date=2010-01-17|accessdate=2013-02-01|work=Sabah}}</ref> Her brothers owned a popular music club named ''Beethoven'' in central Ankara, where she met some of these singers in person and where she was a regular performer herself throughout her years as a university student.<ref name="radikal"/>

==Career==

Her career as a professional musician started in 1971, during her final year at the university, with the encouragement and support of the Ankara-based music producer Erkan Özerman.<ref name="interview"/> The six singles she released that year, in which she interpreted traditional Turkish folk songs in a strong, emotional voice, accompanied by a simple acoustic guitar or [[bağlama]], carried her to national fame. In 1972, she was selected by the Turkish [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] to represent Turkey in the international [[Golden Orpheus]] song contest.<ref name="biyografi"/> She released twelve more singles and three [[LP records]] until 1980 and toured many cities in Turkey and western Europe. Many of her songs carried strong social criticism and solidarity with the poor and the working class, which made her especially popular among the left-wing activists and sympathisers during the politically polarized 1970s.

She experimented with [[rock and roll]] and with synthetic and electronic sounds in her LPs, although her musical style remained firmly rooted in the folk tradition. After the [[1980 Turkish coup d'état]], she was persecuted by the military rulers due to her political songs,<ref>{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Plummer |title=Music sleuths seek out lost tunes |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8113107.stm |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2009-07-02 | work=BBC News}}</ref> and was imprisoned three times between 1981 and 1984.<ref name="biyografi"/> Her passport was confiscated and held by the authorities until 1987, which, among other things, prevented her from attending the first [[WOMAD Charlton Park|WOMAD Reading]] festival in 1986. Partly thanks to pressure from [[WOMAD]], her passport was returned in 1987 and she immediately started a European tour, giving concerts in [[the Netherlands]] and [[the United Kingdom]] in the same year.

Since then, she has produced several albums and given concerts in many cities in Turkey and all over the world, and remains active in the Turkish musical scene. Her 1993 single ''Uğurlar Olsun'' (Farewell), a [[lament]] she composed for the assassinated journalist [[Uğur Mumcu]], was immensely popular and quickly became a symbol for the political turbulence of the 1990s, a period marked by several unsolved high-profile assassinations in Turkey.<ref>{{cite news |title=Investigation of unsolved murders should touch judges, prosecutors |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/national_investigation-of-unsolved-murders-should-touch-judges-prosecutors_305210.html |date=2013-01-27 |accessdate=2014-11-13 | work=Today's Zaman}}</ref> In late 2000, she was badly injured in a car accident on her way to a concert in [[Antakya]], suffering several broken bones as well as contusions and cuts all over her body.<ref>{{cite news |title=Selda Bağcan'ın sağlık durumu iyiye gidiyor |url=http://www.porttakal.com/ahaber-selda-bagcanin-saglik-durumu-iyiye-gidiyor-297437.html |date=2000-09-03 |accessdate=2013-02-09 | work=PorttaKal.com}}</ref> She was able to make full recovery after a lengthy period of treatment.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nazan |last=Mengü |title=İçinden hüzün geçen ses |url=http://arama.hurriyet.com.tr/arsivnews.aspx?id=106595 |date=2002-10-30 |accessdate=2013-02-09 | work=Hürriyet Kültür Sanat}}</ref> She expressed solidarity with the [[Gezi Park protests]] of 2013, even though she was not able to physically participate in the protests due to a concert in Belgium.<ref>{{cite news |first=Hakan |last=Gence |title=‘Gesi Bağları’ndan ‘Gezi Bağları’na |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/pazar/24626255.asp |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2015-04-10 | work=Hürriyet Pazar}}</ref> In November 2014, Selda headlined [[Le Guess Who?]] Festival in Utrecht, The Netherlands, together with bands that admitted to be influenced by her music, including [[St. Vincent (musician)|St. Vincent]], [[Tune-Yards]] and [[Suuns]] and Jerusalem In My Heart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.leguesswho.com/2014/|title=Le Guess Who? Festival 2014 official site}}</ref> [[Florence Welch]] has listed her as an influence for her music.

Bağcan currently lives in [[Istanbul]] and runs the music production company Majör Müzik Yapım. Her music has been [[Sampling (music)|sampled]] by several musicians outside of Turkey, including the band [[2manydjs]] and hip-hop artists [[Mos Def]], [[Oh No (musician)|Oh No]], and [[Dr. Dre]].
