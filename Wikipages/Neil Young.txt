Shortly after Young's birth in 1945, the family moved to rural [[Omemee, Ontario]], which Young later described fondly as a "sleepy little place".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=22–42}} Young suffered from [[polio]] in 1952 during the last major outbreak of the disease in Ontario.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=44}} After his recovery, the Young family vacationed in Florida. During that period, Young briefly attended Faulkner Elementary School in [[New Smyrna Beach, Florida]]. In 1952, upon returning to Canada, Young moved from Omemee to [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] (1956), lived for a year in Winnipeg (where he would later return to), before relocating to Toronto (1957–1960).

Young became interested in popular music he heard on the radio.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=46–54}} When Young was twelve, his father, who had had several extramarital affairs, left his mother.

During the mid-1950s, Young listened to [[rock and roll|rock 'n roll]], [[rockabilly]], [[doo-wop]], [[rhythm and blues|R&B]], [[Country music|country]], and western pop. He idolized [[Elvis Presley]] and later referred to him in a number of his songs.<ref>Ostrosser, David. "Neil Young Interview on Guitars." ''Guitare & Claviers Magazine''.

==Career==
===Early career (1963–1966)===

Young and his mother settled into the working-class area of [[Fort Rouge, Winnipeg]], where the shy, dry-humored youth enrolled at Earl Grey Junior High School. It was there that he formed his first band, the Jades, and met [[Ken Koblun]]. While attending [[Kelvin High School]] in Winnipeg, he played in several instrumental rock bands, eventually dropping out of school in favor of a musical career.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=103}} Young's first stable band was [[The Squires]], with Ken Koblun, Jeff Wuckert and Bill Edmondson on drums, who had a local hit called "The Sultan". Over a three-year period the band played hundreds of shows at community centers, dance halls, clubs and schools in Winnipeg and other parts of Manitoba. The band also played in [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] (now part of the city of Thunder Bay, Ontario), where they recorded a series of demos produced by a local producer, Ray Dee, whom Young called "the original Briggs".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=105}} While playing at The Flamingo, Young met [[Stephen Stills]], whose band [[The Company (folk rock band)|The Company]] was playing the same venue, and they became friends.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YBB0DQAAQBAJ&pg=PT224|page=224|title=Everybody Had an Ocean: Music and Mayhem in 1960s Los Angeles|author=William McKeen|publisher=Chicago Review Press|date=April 1, 2017|isbn=9781613734940}}</ref> The Squires primarily performed in Winnipeg and rural Manitoba in towns such as [[Selkirk, Manitoba|Selkirk]], [[Neepawa, Manitoba|Neepawa]], [[Brandon, Manitoba|Brandon]] and Giroux (near [[Steinbach, Manitoba|Steinbach]]), with a few shows in northern Ontario.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b4EXBwAAQBAJ&pg=PT50|page=50|title=Waging Heavy Peace Deluxe: A Hippie Dream|author=Neil Young|publisher=Penguin|date=November 1, 2012|isbn = 9780241966242}}</ref>

After leaving the Squires, Young worked folk clubs in Winnipeg, where he first met Joni Mitchell.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=96}} Mitchell recalls Young as having been highly influenced by [[Bob Dylan]] at the time.<ref>''The Rolling Stone Interviews'' by Jann Werner (editor) & Joe Levy (editor). Back Bay Books (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-316-00526-5}}.</ref> Here he wrote some of his earliest and most enduring folk songs such as "[[Sugar Mountain (song)|Sugar Mountain]]", about lost youth. Mitchell wrote "The Circle Game" in response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/jammin_more.htm#joni|title=Neil Young Collaborations|publisher=Thrasher's Wheat|access-date=May 9, 2009}}</ref> The Winnipeg band [[The Guess Who]] (with [[Randy Bachman]] as lead guitarist) had a Canadian Top 40 hit with Young's "Flying on the Ground is Wrong", which was Young's first major success as a songwriter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/neil-young-first-professional-gig/|title=The Story of Neil Young's First Professional Gig|author=Sterling Whitaker|date=February 1, 2016}}</ref>

In 1965, Young toured Canada as a solo artist. In 1966, while in Toronto, he joined the [[Rick James]]-fronted [[Mynah Birds]]. The band managed to secure a record deal with the [[Motown]] label, but as their first album was being recorded, James was arrested for being [[Desertion|AWOL]] from the Navy Reserve.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=139}} After the Mynah Birds disbanded, Young and the bass player [[Bruce Palmer]] decided to pawn the group's musical equipment and buy a [[Pontiac (automobile)|Pontiac]] [[hearse]], which they used to relocate to Los Angeles.<ref name="WFP">{{cite news|url=https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/entertainment/music/one-moment-that-made-music-history-375979631.html|title=One moment that made music history|author=John Einarson|newspaper=Winnipeg Free Press|date=April 16, 2017|access-date=November 26, 2018}}</ref> Young admitted in a 2009 interview that he was in the United States illegally until he received a "green card" ([[Permanent residence (United States)|permanent residency permit]]) in 1970.<ref name=interview/>

===Buffalo Springfield (1966–1968)===
{{Main|Buffalo Springfield}}
Once they reached Los Angeles, Young and Palmer met up with [[Stephen Stills]] and [[Richie Furay]] after a chance encounter in traffic on [[Sunset Boulevard]].<ref name="WFP" /> Along with [[Dewey Martin (musician)|Dewey Martin]], they formed [[Buffalo Springfield]]. A mixture of folk, country, [[psychedelia]], and rock, lent a hard edge by the twin lead guitars of Stills and Young, made Buffalo Springfield a critical success, and their first record ''[[Buffalo Springfield (album)|Buffalo Springfield]]'' (1966) sold well after Stills' topical song "[[For What It's Worth]]" became a hit, aided by Young's melodic harmonics played on electric guitar. According to ''Rolling Stone'', the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and other sources, Buffalo Springfield helped create the genres of folk rock and country rock.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/buffalo-springfield|title=Buffalo Springfield|magazine=[[Rollingstone.com]]|access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name="Unterberger">{{cite book|last = Unterberger |first=Richie|date=2003 |title= Eight Miles High: Folk-Rock's Flight from Haight-Ashbury to Woodstock |location=San Francisco |publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-743-9}}</ref>

Distrust of their management, as well as the arrest and deportation of Palmer, worsened the already strained relations among the group members and led to Buffalo Springfield's demise. A second album, ''[[Buffalo Springfield Again]]'', was released in late 1967, but two of Young's three contributions were solo tracks recorded apart from the rest of the group.

From that album, "[[Mr. Soul]]" was the only Young song of the three that all five members of the group performed together. "[[Broken Arrow (Buffalo Springfield song)|Broken Arrow]]" features snippets of sound from other sources, including opening the song with a soundbite of Dewey Martin singing "Mr. Soul" and closing it with the thumping of a heartbeat. "[[Expecting to Fly (song)|Expecting to Fly]]" featured a string arrangement that Young's co-producer for the track, [[Jack Nitzsche]], dubbed "symphonic pop". {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In May 1968, the band split up for good, but to fulfill a contractual obligation, a final studio album, ''[[Last Time Around]]'', was released. The album was primarily composed of recordings made earlier that year. Young contributed the songs "On the Way Home" and "I Am a Child", singing lead on the latter. In 1997, the band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame; Young did not appear at the ceremony. The three surviving members, Furay, Stills, and Young, appeared together as Buffalo Springfield at Young's annual Bridge School Benefit on October 23–24, 2010, and at Bonnaroo in the summer of 2011.

Young also played as a studio session guitarist for some 1968 recordings by [[The Monkees]] which appeared on the ''[[Head (The Monkees album)|Head]]'' and ''[[Instant Replay (The Monkees album)|Instant Replay]]'' albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/artist-news/time-neil-young-cut-loose-monkees/29926|title=That Time Neil Young Let Loose with The Monkees |publisher=[[Guitar World]]|date=October 2016}}</ref>

===Going solo, Crazy Horse (1968–1969)===
{{main|Crazy Horse (band)}}
After the breakup of Buffalo Springfield, Young signed a solo deal with [[Reprise Records]], home of his colleague and friend [[Joni Mitchell]], with whom he shared a manager, [[Elliot Roberts]]. Roberts managed Young until his death in 2019. Young and Roberts immediately began work on Young's first solo record, ''[[Neil Young (album)|Neil Young]]'' (January 22, 1969),<ref>The Village Voice (February 6, 1969) [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1299&dat=19690206&id=xscpAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9IsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6132,1163188 "Reprise Ad – Tea Fan Seeks Mate"]. News.google.com. Retrieved January 26, 2016.</ref> which received mixed reviews. In a 1970 interview,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiancontent.net/people/music/Neil-Young.html|title=Neil Young – MiniBio|publisher=Canadian Content|year=2008|access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref> Young deprecated the album as being "overdubbed rather than played." The album contains songs that remain a staple of his live shows, including "[[The Loner (Neil Young song)|The Loner]]."

For his next album, Young recruited three musicians from a band called The Rockets: [[Danny Whitten]] on guitar, [[Billy Talbot]] on bass guitar, and [[Ralph Molina]] on drums. These three took the name [[Crazy Horse (band)|Crazy Horse]] (after [[Crazy Horse|the historical figure of the same name]]), and ''[[Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere]]'' (May 1969), is credited to "Neil Young with Crazy Horse." Recorded in just two weeks, the album includes "[[Cinnamon Girl]]", "[[Cowgirl in the Sand]]", and "[[Down by the River (Neil Young song)|Down by the River]]." Young reportedly wrote all three songs in bed on the same day while nursing a high fever of {{convert|103|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rogan|first=Johnny|title=Neil Young, Zero to Sixty: A Critical Biography|publisher=Music Sales Distributed|year=2000|page=187|isbn=978-0-9529540-4-0}}</ref>

===Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young (1969–1970)===
{{main|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young}}
Shortly after the release of ''Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere,'' Young reunited with Stephen Stills by joining [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]], who had already released one album ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'' as a trio in May 1969. Young was originally offered a position as a sideman, but agreed to join only if he received full membership, and the group – winners of the 1969 "Best New Artist" [[Grammy Award]] – was renamed [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=313}} The quartet debuted in Chicago on August 16, 1969, and later performed at the famous [[Woodstock Festival]], during which Young skipped the majority of the acoustic set and refused to be filmed during the electric set, even telling the cameramen: "One of you fuckin' guys comes near me and I'm gonna fuckin' hit you with my guitar".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=318–320}} During the making of their first album, ''[[Déjà Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|Déjà Vu]]'' (March 11, 1970), the musicians frequently argued, particularly Young and Stills, who both fought for control. Stills continued throughout their lifelong relationship to criticize Young, saying that he "wanted to play folk music in a rock band."{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=324}} Despite the tension, Young's tenure with CSN&Y coincided with the band's most creative and successful period, and greatly contributed to his subsequent success as a solo artist.

Young wrote "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]" following the [[Kent State massacre]] on May 4, 1970. The song was quickly recorded by CSN&Y and immediately released as a single, even though CSN&Y's "Teach Your Children" was still climbing the singles charts.

===''After the Gold Rush'', acoustic tour and ''Harvest'' (1970–1972)===
Later in the year, Young released his third solo album, ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (August 31, 1970), which featured, among others, [[Nils Lofgren]], [[Stephen Stills]], and CSNY bassist [[Greg Reeves]]. Young also recorded some tracks with Crazy Horse, but dismissed them early in the sessions. The eventual recording was less amplified than ''Everybody Knows This is Nowhere'', with a wider range of sounds. Young's newfound fame with CSNY made the album his commercial breakthrough as a solo artist, and it contains some of his best known work, including "[[Tell Me Why (Neil Young song)|Tell Me Why]]" and "[[Don't Let It Bring You Down]]", the country-influenced singles "[[Only Love Can Break Your Heart]]" and "[[When You Dance I Can Really Love]]", and the title track, "[[After the Gold Rush (song)|After the Gold Rush]]", played on piano, with dream-like lyrics that ran a gamut of subjects from drugs and interpersonal relationships to [[environmentalism|environmental concerns]]. Young's bitter condemnation of racism in the heavy blues-rock song "[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]" (along with a later song entitled "Alabama") was also controversial with southerners in an era of desegregation, prompting [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]] to decry Young by name in the lyrics to their hit "[[Sweet Home Alabama (song)|Sweet Home Alabama]]." However, Young said he was a fan of Skynyrd's music, and the band's front man [[Ronnie Van Zant]] was later photographed wearing a ''Tonight's the Night'' T-shirt [[Street Survivors|on the cover of an album]].

[[File:Neil Young-early promo.jpg|thumb|Young in the 1970s]]
In the autumn of 1970, Young began a solo acoustic tour of North America, during which he played a variety of his Buffalo Springfield and CSNY songs on guitar and piano, along with material from his solo albums and a number of new songs. Some songs premiered by Young on the tour, like "Journey through the Past", would never find a home on a studio album, while other songs, like "See the Sky About to Rain", would only be released in coming years. With CSNY splitting up and Crazy Horse having signed their own record deal, Young's tour, now entitled "Journey Through the Past", continued into early 1971, and its focus shifted more to newer songs he had been writing; he famously remarked that having written so many, he could not think of anything to do but play them. Many gigs were sold out, including concerts at [[Carnegie Hall]] and a pair of acclaimed hometown shows at Toronto's [[Massey Hall]], which were taped for a planned live album. The shows became legendary among Young fans, and the recordings were officially released nearly 40 years later as an official bootleg in Young's Archive series.

Near the end of his tour, Young performed one of the new acoustic songs on the ''[[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|Johnny Cash]]'' TV show. "[[The Needle and the Damage Done]]", a somber lament on the pain caused by [[heroin addiction]], had been inspired in part by Crazy Horse member [[Danny Whitten]], who eventually died while battling his drug problems.{{sfn|Williamson|2002|p=42}}{{sfn|Taylor|2006|p=279}} While in Nashville for the Cash taping, Young accepted the invitation of [[Quadrafonic Sound Studios]] owner [[Elliot Mazer]] to record tracks there with a group of country-music session musicians who were pulled together at the last minute. Making a connection with them, he christened them [[The Stray Gators]], and began playing with them. Befitting the immediacy of the project, [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]] were brought in from the Cash taping to do background vocals. Against the advice of his producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]], he scrapped plans for the imminent release<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |title=Neil comments on massey hall release :: Bad News Beat :: on Neil Young |website=Bad-news-beat.org |access-date=July 11, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928010740/http://www.bad-news-beat.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1889 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> of the live acoustic recording in favor of a studio album consisting of the Nashville sessions, electric-guitar oriented sessions recorded later in his barn, and two recordings made with the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at Barking (credited as Barking Town Hall and now the [[The Broadway (theatre)|Broadway Theatre]]) during March 1971.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.longlivevinyl.net/classic-album-neil-young-harvest/ |title=Classic Album: Neil Young – Harvest|date=June 2, 2017 |work=Long Live Vinyl |access-date=October 10, 2017 |language=en-GB}}</ref> The result was Young's fourth album, ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (February 14, 1972), which was also the best selling album of 1972 in the US.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/1972/top-billboard-200-albums|title=Billboard Year End 1972|work=Billboard|date=January 2, 2013|access-date=September 15, 2021}}</ref> The only remnant left of the original live concept was the album's live acoustic performance of "Needle and the Damage Done."

After his success with CSNY, Young purchased a ranch in the rural hills above Woodside and Redwood City in Northern California ("Broken Arrow Ranch", where he lived until his divorce in 2014).<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-neil-youngs-nature-themed-opus-20160705|title=Inside Neil Young's Nature-Themed Opus|website=Rollingstone.com|date=July 5, 2016|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref> He wrote the song "[[Old Man (song)|Old Man]]" in honor of the land's longtime caretaker, Louis Avila. The song "[[A Man Needs a Maid (song)|A Man Needs a Maid]]" was inspired by his relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. "[[Heart of Gold (Neil Young song)|Heart of Gold]]" was released as the first single from ''Harvest'', the only No.&nbsp;1 hit in his career.<ref name="whitburn Top40">{{cite book|last = Whitburn |first=Joel|date=2010 |title= The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Revised and Expanded Ninth Edition |location=New York |publisher=Billboard Books |page=722 |isbn=978-0-8230-8554-5}}</ref> "Old Man" was also popular, reaching No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, marking Young's third and final appearance in the chart's Top 40 as a solo artist.<ref name="whitburn Top40" />

The album's recording had been almost accidental. Its mainstream success caught Young off guard, and his first instinct was to back away from stardom. In the ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'' (1977) compilation, Young chose to include his greatest hits from the period, but his handwritten liner notes famously described "Heart of Gold" as the song that "put me in the middle of the road. Traveling there soon became a bore, so I headed for the ditch. A rougher ride but I saw more interesting people there."

===The "Ditch" Trilogy and personal struggles (1972–1974)===
Although a new tour with The Stray Gators (now augmented by Danny Whitten) had been planned to follow up on the success of ''Harvest'', it became apparent during rehearsals that Whitten could not function due to drug abuse. On November 18, 1972, shortly after he was fired from the tour preparations, Whitten was found dead of an apparent [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]]/[[diazepam]] overdose. Young described the incident to ''Rolling Stone''{{'}}s [[Cameron Crowe]] in 1975:<ref name="interview">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409205354/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/profile/story/9102786/neil_young_the_rs_interview|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2006|title=Neil Young: The RS Interview|magazine=Rollingstone.com|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref> "[We] were rehearsing with him and he just couldn't cut it. He couldn't remember anything. He was too out of it. Too far gone. I had to tell him to go back to L.A. 'It's not happening, man. You're not together enough.' He just said, 'I've got nowhere else to go, man. How am I gonna tell my friends?' And he split. That night the coroner called me from L.A. and told me he'd OD'd. That blew my mind. I loved Danny. I felt responsible. And from there, I had to go right out on this huge tour of huge arenas. I was very nervous and ... insecure."

On the tour, Young struggled with his voice and the performance of drummer [[Kenny Buttrey]], a noted Nashville session musician who was unaccustomed to performing in the [[hard rock]] milieu; Buttrey was eventually replaced by former CSNY drummer [[Johnny Barbata]], while [[David Crosby]] and [[Graham Nash]] contributed rhythm guitar and backing vocals to the final dates of the tour. The album assembled in the aftermath of this incident, ''[[Time Fades Away]]'' (October 15, 1973), has often been described by Young as "[his] least favorite record", and was not officially released on CD until 2017 (as part of Young's [[Neil Young Archives#Official Release Series 05:|Official Release Series]]). Nevertheless, Young and his band tried several new musical approaches in this period. ''Time Fades Away'', for instance, was recorded live, although it was an album of new material, an approach Young would repeat with more success later on. ''Time'' was the first of three consecutive commercial failures which would later become known collectively to fans as the "Ditch Trilogy", as contrasted with the more middle-of-the-road pop of ''Harvest''.<ref name="UnCut">{{cite news|last=Pinnock|first=Tom|title=Neil Young's 'Time Fades Away': 'Harvest's unlikely follow-up|url=http://www.uncut.co.uk/neil-young/neil-young-s-time-fades-away-harvests-unlikely-follow-up-feature|access-date=January 3, 2014|newspaper=[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]|date=May 2010|issue=156}}</ref> These subsequent albums were seen as more challenging expressions of Young's inner conflicts on achieving success, expressing both the specific struggles of his friends and himself, and the decaying idealism of his generation in America at the time.

[[File:Neil Young in Austin, 1976.jpg|thumb|Young in [[Austin, Texas]], on November 9, 1976]]

In the second half of 1973, Young formed The Santa Monica Flyers, with Crazy Horse's rhythm section augmented by [[Nils Lofgren]] on guitar and piano and ''Harvest''/''Time Fades Away'' veteran [[Ben Keith]] on pedal steel guitar. Deeply affected by the drug-induced deaths of Whitten and [[roadie]] [[Bruce Berry (roadie)|Bruce Berry]], Young recorded an album specifically inspired by the incidents, ''[[Tonight's the Night (Neil Young album)|Tonight's the Night]]'' (June 20, 1975). The album's dark tone and rawness led Reprise to delay its release and Young had to pressure them for two years before they would do so.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=430}} While his record company was stalling, Young recorded another album, ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'' (July 16, 1974), which presented a more melodic, acoustic sound at times, including a recording of the older song "See the Sky About to Rain", but dealt with similarly dark themes such as the collapse of 1960s folk ideals, the downside of success and the underbelly of the Californian lifestyle. Like ''Time Fades Away'', it sold poorly but eventually became a critical favorite, presenting some of Young's most original work. A review of the 2003 re-release on CD of ''On the Beach'' described the music as "mesmerizing, harrowing, lucid, and bleary".<ref name="sven">{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.com/a&e/soundfury904.htm |title=Neil Young – On the Beach (Reprise) |newspaper=The Santa Barbara Independent |date=March 18, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040421143346/http://www.independent.com/a%26e/soundfury904.htm |archive-date=April 21, 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After completing ''On the Beach'', Young reunited with ''Harvest'' producer Elliot Mazer to record another acoustic album, ''[[Homegrown (Neil Young album)|Homegrown]]''. Most of the songs were written after Young's breakup with Carrie Snodgress, and thus the tone of the album was somewhat dark. Though ''Homegrown'' was reportedly entirely complete, Young decided, not for the first or last time in his career, to drop it and release something else instead, in this case, ''Tonight's the Night'', at the suggestion of [[The Band|Band]] bassist [[Rick Danko]].{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Young further explained his move by saying: "It was a little too personal ... it scared me".{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=469}} Most of the songs from ''Homegrown'' were later incorporated into other Young albums while the original album was not released until 2020. ''Tonight's the Night,'' when finally released in 1975, sold poorly, as had the previous albums of the "ditch" trilogy, and received mixed reviews at the time, but is now regarded as a landmark album. In Young's own opinion, it was the closest he ever came to art.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=433}}

===Reunions, retrospectives and ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1974–1979)===
Young reunited with [[Crosby, Stills, and Nash]] after a four-year hiatus in the summer of 1974 for a concert tour which was partially recorded; highlights were ultimately released in 2014 as ''[[CSNY 1974]]''. It was one of the first ever stadium tours, and the largest tour in which Young has participated to date.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=452}}

In 1975, Young reformed Crazy Horse with [[Frank Sampedro]] on guitar as his backup band for his eighth album, ''[[Zuma (album)|Zuma]]'' (November 10, 1975). Many of the songs dealt with the theme of failed relationships; "[[Cortez the Killer]]", a retelling of the [[Spanish conquest]] of Mexico from the viewpoint of the [[Aztec]]s, may also be heard as an allegory of love lost. ''Zuma''{{'}}s closing track, "Through My Sails", was the only released fragment from aborted sessions with Crosby, Stills and Nash for another group album.

In 1976, Young reunited with Stephen Stills for the album ''[[Long May You Run]]'' (September 20, 1976), credited to [[The Stills-Young Band]]; the follow-up tour was ended midway through by Young, who sent Stills a [[telegram]] that read: "Funny how some things that start spontaneously end that way. Eat a peach, Neil."{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=502}}

[[File:The Last Waltz.jpg|thumb|''The Last Waltz'', Young (center on left microphone) performing with Bob Dylan and [[The Band]], among others in 1976]]

In 1976, Young performed with Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell, and numerous other rock musicians in the high-profile all-star concert ''[[The Last Waltz]]'', the final performance by [[The Band]]. The release of [[Martin Scorsese]]'s movie of the concert was delayed while Scorsese unwillingly re-edited it to obscure the lump of cocaine that was clearly visible hanging from Young's nose during his performance of "[[Helpless (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Helpless]]".<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite magazine|last=Schneider|first=Jason|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid1=1741|title=Neil Young – Searching for a Heart of Gold|date=August 4, 2003|magazine=Exclaim!|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030901150951/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid1=1741|archive-date=September 1, 2003}}</ref> ''[[American Stars 'n Bars]]'' (June 13, 1977) contained two songs originally recorded for the ''Homegrown'' album, "Homegrown" and "Star of Bethlehem", as well as newer material, including the future concert staple "[[Like a Hurricane (Neil Young song)|Like a Hurricane]]". Performers on the record included [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Emmylou Harris]] and Young protégé [[Nicolette Larson]] along with Crazy Horse. In 1977, Young also released the compilation ''[[Decade (Neil Young album)|Decade]]'', a personally selected set of songs spanning every aspect of his work, including a handful of previously unreleased songs. The record included less commercial album tracks alongside radio hits.

''[[Comes a Time]]'' (October 2, 1978), Young's first entirely new solo recording since the mid-1970s, marked a return to the commercially accessible, Nashville-inspired sound of ''Harvest'' while also featuring contributions from Larson and Crazy Horse. The album also marked a return to his folk roots, as exemplified by a cover of [[Ian Tyson]]'s "[[Four Strong Winds]]", a song Young associated with his childhood in Canada. Another of the album's songs, "[[Lotta Love]]", was also recorded by Larson, with her version reaching No. 8 on the Billboard Hot 100 in February 1979. In 1978, much of the filming was done for Young's film ''[[Human Highway]]'', which took its name from a song featured on ''Comes a Time''. Over four years, Young would spend US$3,000,000 of his own money on production (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|3000000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}). This also marked the beginning of his brief collaboration with the [[art punk]] band [[Devo]], whose members appeared in the film.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=575–577}}

Young set out in 1978 on the lengthy ''Rust Never Sleeps'' tour, in which he played a wealth of new material. Each concert was divided into a solo acoustic set and an electric set with Crazy Horse. The electric sets, featuring an abrasive style of playing, were influenced by the [[punk rock]] [[zeitgeist]] of the late 1970s and provided a stark contrast from ''Comes a Time''.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=529–537}} Two new songs, the acoustic "[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)]]" and electric "[[Hey Hey, My My (Into the Black)]]" were the centerpiece of the new material. During the filming of ''Human Highway'', Young had collaborated with Devo on a cacophonous version of "Hey Hey, My My" at the [[Different Fur]] studio in San Francisco and would later introduce the song to Crazy Horse.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531–532}} The lyric "It's better to burn out than to fade away" was widely quoted by his peers and by critics.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=531–532}} The album has also widely been considered a precursor of [[grunge]] music and many grunge artists have said they were inspired by Young's distorted guitars on the B side to this album. Young also compared the rise of [[Johnny Rotten]] with that of the recently deceased "King" [[Elvis Presley]], who himself had once been disparaged as a dangerous influence only to later become an [[Pop icon|icon]]. Rotten returned the favor by playing one of Young's songs, "Revolution Blues" from ''[[On the Beach (Neil Young album)|On the Beach]]'', on a London radio show, an early sign of Young's eventual embrace by a number of punk-influenced alternative musicians.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schneider|first1=Martin|title=DJ Johnny Rotten plays music from his own record collection on the radio, 1977|url=http://dangerousminds.net/comments/dj_johnny_rotten_plays_music_from_his_own_record_collection_on_the_radio_19|website=Dangerousminds.net|date=June 16, 2016|access-date=April 15, 2017}}</ref>

Young's two accompanying albums ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (July 2, 1979; new material culled from live recordings, but featuring studio overdubs) and ''[[Live Rust]]'' (November 19, 1979; a genuine concert recording featuring old and new material) captured the two sides of the concerts, with solo acoustic songs on side A, and fierce, uptempo, electric songs on side B. A movie version of the concerts, also called ''Rust Never Sleeps'' (1979), was directed by Young under the pseudonym "Bernard Shakey". Young worked with rock artist [[Jim Evans (artist)|Jim Evans]] to create the poster art for the film, using the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[Jawas]] as a theme. Young's work since ''Harvest'' had alternated between being rejected by mass audiences and being seen as backward-looking by critics, sometimes both at once, and now he was suddenly viewed as relevant by a new generation, who began to discover his earlier work. Readers and critics of ''Rolling Stone'' voted him Artist of the Year for 1979 (along with The Who), selected ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' as Album of the Year, and voted him Male Vocalist of the Year as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/rolling.htm#1979 |title=Albums Of The Year And End Of Year Critic Lists |publisher=Rocklist.net |access-date=February 5, 2020 }}</ref> ''[[The Village Voice]]'' named ''Rust Never Sleeps'' as the year's winner in the [[Pazz & Jop]] Poll, a survey of nationwide critics, and honored Young as the Artist of the Decade. The [[Warner Music Vision]] release on VHS of ''Rust Never Sleeps'' in 1987 had a running time of 116 minutes, and although fully manufactured in Germany, was initially imported from there by the markets throughout Europe.

===Experimental years (1980–1988)===
At the start of the decade, distracted by medical concerns relating to the [[cerebral palsy]] of his son, Ben, Young had little time to spend on writing and recording.<ref name="Hawks & Doves Review">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r22517|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hawks & Doves Review|website=allmusic|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> After providing the incidental music to a 1980 biographical film of [[Hunter S.

The 1982 album ''[[Trans (album)|Trans]]'', which incorporated [[vocoder]]s, synthesizers, and electronic beats, was Young's first for the new label [[Geffen Records]] (distributed at the time by [[Warner Bros. Records]], whose parent [[Warner Music Group]] owns most of Young's solo and band catalog) and represented a distinct stylistic departure. Young later revealed that an inspiration for the album was the theme of technology and communication with Ben, who could not speak.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r22519|pure_url=yes}}|website=allmusic|title=Trans Review|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> An extensive tour preceded the release of the album, and was documented by the video ''[[Neil Young in Berlin]]'', which saw release in 1986. MTV played the video for "Sample and Hold" in light rotation. The entire song contained "robot vocals" by Young and Nils Lofgren.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}} The song "After Berlin" as seen in that video, was the only time Neil Young has ever performed the song.

[[File:Para Rael99 (que nos quiten lo bailao).jpg|thumb|Young playing in [[Barcelona]], Spain, 1984]]

Young's next album, 1983's ''[[Everybody's Rockin']]'', included several [[rockabilly]] covers and clocked in at less than twenty-five minutes in length. Young was backed by the Shocking Pinks for the supporting US tour. ''Trans'' (1982) had already drawn the ire of label head [[David Geffen]] for its lack of commercial appeal, and with ''Everybody's Rockin''{{'}} following only seven months later, Geffen Records sued Young for making music "unrepresentative" of himself.<ref>{{cite book|title=A fiction of the past: the sixties in American history|last=Cavallo|first=Dominick|year=1999|publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]]|location=New York|isbn=978-0-312-21930-7|oclc=39981636|url=https://archive.org/details/fictionofpastsix00cava}}</ref> The album was also notable as the first for which Young made commercial music videos – [[Tim Pope]] directed the videos for "Wonderin'" and "Cry, Cry, Cry". Also premiered in 1983, though little seen, was the long-gestating ''Human Highway''. Co-directed and co-written by Young, the eclectic comedy starred Young, [[Dean Stockwell]], [[Russ Tamblyn]], [[Dennis Hopper]], [[David Blue (musician)|David Blue]], [[Sally Kirkland]], [[Charlotte Stewart]] and members of Devo.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

1984 marked the first year without a Neil Young album since the start of Young's musical career with Buffalo Springfield in 1966. Young's lack of productivity was largely due to the ongoing legal battle with Geffen, although he was also frustrated that the label had rejected his 1982 country album ''[[Old Ways]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r22521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Old Ways album review|website=allmusic|access-date=April 7, 2009}}</ref> It was also the year when Young's third child was born, a girl named Amber Jean. Later diagnosed with inherited epilepsy but otherwise healthy, Amber Jean was Neil and Pegi's second child together.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

Young spent most of 1984 and all of 1985 touring for ''Old Ways'' (August 12, 1985) with his country band, the International Harvesters. The album was finally released in an altered form midway through 1985. Young also appeared at that year's [[Live Aid]] concert in [[Philadelphia]], collaborating with Crosby, Stills and Nash for the quartet's first performance for a paying audience in over ten years.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

Young's last two albums for Geffen were more conventional in the genre, although they incorporated production techniques like synthesizers and echoing drums that were previously uncommon in Young's music. Young recorded 1986's ''[[Landing on Water]]'' without Crazy Horse but reunited with the band for the subsequent year-long tour and final Geffen album, ''[[Life (1987 album)|Life]]'', which emerged in 1987. Young's album sales dwindled steadily throughout the eighties; today ''Life'' remains his all-time-least successful studio album, with an estimated four hundred thousand sales worldwide.<ref>As of June 2008 {{cite web|title=Neil Young Worldwide Album Sales Estimates|url=http://www.chartsinfrance.net/communaute/index.php?showtopic=6523&st=1365&gopid=969589&#entry969589|date=June 14, 2008|access-date=April 8, 2009}}</ref>

Switching back to his old label Reprise Records, Young continued to tour relentlessly, assembling a new blues band called The Bluenotes in mid-1987 (a legal dispute with musician [[Harold Melvin]] forced the eventual rechristening of the band as Ten Men Working midway through the tour). The addition of a [[brass instruments|brass]] section provided a new [[jazz]]ier sound, and the title track of 1988's ''[[This Note's For You]]'' became Young's first hit single of the decade. Accompanied by a video that parodied corporate rock, the pretensions of advertising, and [[Michael Jackson]], the song was initially unofficially banned by MTV for mentioning the brand names of some of their sponsors. Young wrote an open letter, "What does the M in MTV stand for: music or money?" Despite this, the video was eventually named [[MTV Video Music Award for Best Video of the Year|best video of the year]] by the network in 1989.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=24–32}} By comparison, the major music cable network of Young's home nation, [[Muchmusic]], ran the video immediately.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

Young reunited with Crosby, Stills, and Nash to record the 1988 album ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' and play two benefit concerts late in the year, but the group did not embark upon a full tour. The album was only the second-ever studio record for the quartet.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

===Return to prominence (1989–1999)===
[[File:Neil Young 1996.jpg|thumb|Young performing in 1996 in [[Turku]], Finland]]

Young's 1989 single "[[Rockin' in the Free World]]", which hit No.&nbsp;2 on the US mainstream-rock charts, and accompanying the album, ''[[Freedom (1989 album)|Freedom]]'', rocketed him back into the popular consciousness after a decade of sometimes-difficult genre experiments. The album's lyrics were often overtly political; "Rockin' in the Free World" deals with homelessness, terrorism, and environmental degradation, implicitly criticizing the government policies of President [[George H.W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young Lyrics Analysis: Rockin' in the Free World|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/fot/ritfw.htm|website=Thrasherswheat.org|access-date=April 1, 2009}}</ref>

The use of heavy [[feedback]] and distortion on several ''Freedom'' tracks was reminiscent of the ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979) album and foreshadowed the imminent rise of grunge. The rising stars of the subgenre, including [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Pearl Jam]]'s [[Eddie Vedder]], frequently cited Young as a major influence, contributing to his popular revival. A tribute album called ''[[The Bridge: A Tribute to Neil Young]]'' was released in 1989, featuring covers by a range of alternative and grunge acts, including [[Sonic Youth]], [[Nick Cave]], [[Soul Asylum]], [[Dinosaur Jr]], and the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].

Young's 1990 album ''[[Ragged Glory]]'', recorded with Crazy Horse in a barn on his [[Northern California]] ranch, continued this distortion-heavy aesthetic. Young toured for the album with Orange County, California country-punk band [[Social Distortion]] and Sonic Youth as support, much to the consternation of many of his old fans.<ref name="sonic">{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/jammin/sonic_youth.htm|title=Sonic Youth and Neil Young|publisher=Thrasher's Wheat – A Neil Young Archives|access-date=April 1, 2009}}</ref> ''[[Weld (album)|Weld]]'', a two-disc live album documenting the tour, was released in 1991.<ref name="sonic" /> Sonic Youth's influence was evident on ''[[Arc (Neil Young & Crazy Horse album)|Arc]]'', a 35-minute collage of feedback and distortion spliced together at the suggestion of [[Thurston Moore]] and originally packaged with some versions of ''Weld''.<ref name="sonic" />

1992's ''[[Harvest Moon (album)|Harvest Moon]]'' marked an abrupt return (prompted by Young's [[hyperacusis]] in the aftermath of the ''Weld'' tour) to the country and folk-rock stylings of ''Harvest'' and reunited him with some of the musicians from that album, including the core members of the Stray Gators and singers [[Linda Ronstadt]] and [[James Taylor]]. The title track was a minor hit, and the record was well received by critics, winning the [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]] in 1994. Young also contributed to lifelong friend [[Randy Bachman]]'s nostalgic 1992 tune "Prairie Town", and garnered a 1993 [[Academy Award for Best Song|Academy Award]] nomination for his song "Philadelphia", from the soundtrack of the [[Jonathan Demme]] movie [[Philadelphia (movie)|of the same name]]. An ''[[Unplugged (Neil Young album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' performance and album emerged in 1993. Later that year, Young collaborated with [[Booker T. and the M.G.s]] for a summer tour of Europe and North America, with [[Blues Traveler]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[Pearl Jam]] also on the bill. Some European shows ended with a rendition of "Rockin' in the Free World" played with [[Pearl Jam]], foreshadowing their eventual full-scale collaboration two years later.

[[File:Neil Young, Heart of Gold.jpg|thumb|Young on stage in [[Barcelona]]]]

In 1994, Young again collaborated with Crazy Horse for ''[[Sleeps with Angels]]'', a record whose dark, somber mood was influenced by [[Kurt Cobain]]'s death earlier that year: the title track in particular dealt with Cobain's life and death, without mentioning him by name. Cobain had quoted Young's lyric "It's better to burn out than fade away" (a line from "[[My My, Hey Hey (Out of the Blue)|My My, Hey Hey]]") in [[Death of Kurt Cobain#Suicide note|his suicide note]]. Young had reportedly made repeated attempts to contact Cobain prior to his death.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/05/10/1021002387905.html|title=Neil Young: the quiet achiever|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|access-date=January 26, 2010|date=May 11, 2002}}</ref> Young and Pearl Jam performed "Act of Love" at an abortion rights benefit along with Crazy Horse, and were present at a Rock and Roll Hall of Fame dinner, sparking interest in a collaboration between the two.<ref>{{cite news|last=Strauss|first=Neil|date=July 2, 1995 |title=The Predictably Unpredictable Neil Young|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/02/arts/the-predictably-unpredictable-neil-young.html|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=October 2, 2014}}</ref> Still enamored with the grunge scene, Young reconnected with Pearl Jam in 1995 for the live-in-the-studio album ''[[Mirror Ball (Neil Young album)|Mirror Ball]]'' and a tour of Europe with the band and producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] backing Young. 1995 also marked Young's induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], where he was inducted by Eddie Vedder.

In 1995, Young and his manager [[Elliot Roberts]] founded a record label, Vapor Records.<ref name="canadianmusichalloffame">{{cite web|url=http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/this-week-in-music-history-july-15-to-21/|title=This Week in Music History: July 15 to 21|work=[[Canadian Music Hall of Fame]]|first=David|last=Ball|date=July 16, 2013|access-date=February 17, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218063755/http://canadianmusichalloffame.ca/this-week-in-music-history-july-15-to-21/|archive-date=February 18, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has released recordings by [[Tegan and Sara]], [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]], [[Jonathan Richman]], [[Vic Chesnutt]], [[Everest (band)|Everest]], [[Pegi Young]], [[Jets Overhead]], and Young himself, among others.<ref name="canadianmusichalloffame" />

Young's next collaborative partner was filmmaker [[Jim Jarmusch]], who asked Young to compose a [[Dead Man (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to his 1995 black-and-white western film ''[[Dead Man]]''. Young's instrumental soundtrack was improvized while he watched the film alone in a studio. The death of longtime mentor, friend, and producer [[David Briggs (producer)|David Briggs]] in late 1995 prompted Young to reconnect with Crazy Horse the following year for the album and tour ''[[Broken Arrow (album)|Broken Arrow]]''. A Jarmusch-directed concert film and live album of the tour, ''[[Year of the Horse]]'', emerged in 1997. From 1996 to 1997 Young and Crazy Horse toured extensively throughout Europe and North America, including a stint as part of the [[H.O.R.D.E.]] Festival's sixth annual tour.

In 1998, Young renewed his collaboration with the rock band [[Phish]], sharing the stage at the annual [[Farm Aid]] concert and then at Young's Bridge School Benefit, where he joined headliners Phish for renditions of "[[Helpless (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young song)|Helpless]]" and "[[I Shall Be Released]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperrust.org/Bridge/Bridge12.html|title=Bridge Benefit XII|publisher=Hyperrust|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref> Phish declined Young's later invitation to be his backing band on his 1999 North American tour.

The decade ended with the release in late 1999 of ''[[Looking Forward]]'', another reunion with Crosby, Stills, and Nash. The subsequent tour of the United States and Canada with the reformed quartet earned US$42.1&nbsp;million, making it the eighth largest grossing tour of 2000.

===Brush with death (2000s)===
[[File:Csny-8-20-06.jpg|thumb|[[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]] perform at the [[PNC Bank Arts Center]] in 2006. (From L&nbsp;to&nbsp;R: Nash, Stills, Young, and Crosby)]]

Neil Young continued to release new material at a rapid pace through the first decade of the new millennium. The studio album ''[[Silver & Gold (Neil Young album)|Silver & Gold]]'' and live album ''[[Road Rock Vol. 1]]'' were released in 2000 and were both accompanied by live concert films. His 2001 single "Let's Roll" was a tribute to the victims of the [[September 11 attacks]], and the [[Let's Roll|effective action taken by the passengers and crew]] on [[United Airlines flight 93|Flight 93]] in particular.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/20011216song1216lnp5.asp|title=Flight 93's Beamer inspires song by Neil Young|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=December 16, 2001|access-date=April 4, 2009|first=Linton|last=Weeks}}</ref>

In 2003, Young released ''[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]'', a [[concept album]] recorded with Crazy Horse members Billy Talbot and [[Ralph Molina]]. The songs loosely revolved around the murder of a police officer in a small town in California and its effects on the town's inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicbox-online.com/ny-green.html|title=Greendale Review|publisher=The Music Box|date=November 2003|access-date=April 4, 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6CRZPJJoZ?url=http://www.musicbox-online.com/ny-green.html|archive-date=November 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Under the pseudonym "Bernard Shakey", Young directed an accompanying film of the same name, featuring actors lip-synching to the music from the album. He toured extensively with the ''Greendale'' material throughout 2003 and 2004, first with a solo, acoustic version in Europe, then with a full-cast stage show in North America, Japan, and Australia. Young began using [[biodiesel]] on the 2004 Greendale tour, powering his trucks and tour buses with the fuel. "Our Greendale tour is now ozone friendly", he said. "I plan to continue to use this government approved and regulated fuel exclusively from now on to prove that it is possible to deliver the goods anywhere in North America without using foreign oil, while being environmentally responsible."<ref name="biodiesel">{{cite web|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2004/02/hollywood-stars-shine-spotlight-on-green-power-10616|title=Hollywood Stars Shine Spotlight on Green Power &#124; Renewable Energy News Article|publisher=Renewableenergyworld.com|access-date=November 29, 2010}}</ref>

In March 2005, while working on the ''[[Prairie Wind]]'' album in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], Young was diagnosed with a brain [[aneurysm]]. He was treated successfully with a minimally invasive [[Neuroradiology|neuroradiological]] procedure, performed in a New York hospital on March 29,<ref>{{cite news|title=Neil Young treated for 'dangerous' aneurysm|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/01/neil.young/|work=CNN|date=April 1, 2005|access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref> but two days afterwards he passed out on a New York street from bleeding from the [[femoral artery]], which radiologists had used to access the aneurysm.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Resurrection of Neil Young|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1109363,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130091826/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1109363,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 30, 2005|magazine=Time|date=September 26, 2005|access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref> The complication forced Young to cancel his scheduled appearance at the [[Juno Awards]] telecast in Winnipeg, but within months he was back on stage, appearing at the close of the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Barrie, Ontario]], on July 2. During the performance, he debuted a new song, a soft hymn called "When God Made Me". Young's brush with death influenced ''Prairie Wind''{{'}}s themes of retrospection and mortality.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Prairie Wind Music Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neilyoung/albums/album/7637213/review/7645148/prairie_wind|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002044614/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/neilyoung/albums/album/7637213/review/7645148/prairie_wind|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 2, 2007|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=October 6, 2005|access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref> The album's live premiere in Nashville was recorded by filmmaker [[Jonathan Demme]] in the 2006 film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]''.{{citation needed|date = March 2017}}

===Activism, Philantropy and as a Humanitarian===
Young's renewed activism manifested itself in the 2006 album ''[[Living with War]]'', which like the much earlier song "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]", was recorded and released in less than a month as a direct result of current events.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r837350|pure_url=yes}}|title=Living With War Review|website=allmusic|date=May 9, 2006|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref> Most of the album's songs rebuked the Bush administration's policy of war by examining its human costs to soldiers, their loved ones, and civilians, but Young also included a few songs on other themes and an outright protest song entitled "[[Let's Impeach the President]]",<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Living With War Review|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10149965/review/10191400/livingwithwar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314014602/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/10149965/review/10191400/livingwithwar|url-status=dead|archive-date=March 14, 2008|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=May 1, 2006|access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref> in which he asserted that Bush had lied to lead the country into war.

While Young had never been a stranger to eco-friendly lyrics, themes of environmentalist spirituality and activism became increasingly prominent in his work throughout the 1990s and 2000s, especially on ''[[Greendale (album)|Greendale]]'' (2003)<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Neil Young Goes Green on the Road|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jonathanrichman/articles/story/5937268/neil_young_goes_green|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110201915/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/jonathanrichman/articles/story/5937268/neil_young_goes_green|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 10, 2007|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=February 27, 2004|access-date=March 31, 2009}}</ref> and ''[[Living with War]]'' (2006).<ref>"[http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Reprise-692104.html New Neil Young Video 'After The Garden' Visits 'An Inconvenient Truth']", ''Marketwire'' (July 21, 2006).</ref> The trend continued on 2007's ''[[Chrome Dreams II]]'', with lyrics exploring Young's personal eco-spirituality.<ref>{{cite web|title=Neil Young: Chrome Dreams II|url=http://www.umc.org/site/c.lwL4KnN1LtH/b.3779923/k.1891/Neil_Young_iChrome_Dreams_IIi.htm|publisher=[[United Methodist Church]]|access-date=April 4, 2009}}</ref>

Young remains on the board of directors of [[Farm Aid]], an organization he co-founded with [[Willie Nelson]] and [[John Mellencamp]] in 1985. According to its website, it is the longest running concert benefit series in the U.S. and it has raised $43&nbsp;million since its first benefit concert in 1985. Each year, Young co-hosts and performs with well-known guest performers who include [[Dave Matthews]] and producers who include [[Evelyn Shriver]] and [[Mark Rothbaum]], at the Farm Aid annual benefit concerts to raise funds and provide grants to family farms and prevent [[foreclosure]]s, provide a crisis hotline, and create and promote home grown farm food in the United States.<ref name="Young and Farm Aid1">{{cite web|url=http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2723677/k.961B/Board_and_Staff.htm|title=Farm Aid's Hardworking Board and Staff|year=2010|work=Farm Aid information about the board, staff, and concerts|publisher=Farm Aid|access-date=August 11, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805233850/http://www.farmaid.org/site/c.qlI5IhNVJsE/b.2723677/k.961B/Board_and_Staff.htm|archive-date=August 5, 2012}}</ref>

Young has been a vocal opponent of the proposed [[Keystone XL]] oil pipeline, which would run from Alberta to Texas.

In December 2020, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine released a Special Edition marking Young's 75th birthday, called "The Ultimate Guide to His Music & Legend", plus his 100 greatest songs. In a December 2020 Letters To The Editor article on the NYA website, Neil Young revealed that he is currently working on a new solo album, possibly for a 2021 release. The only thing Young had mentioned about the album so far is, "I've been waiting a long time."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://neilyoungarchives.com/news/2/article?id=Letters-Through-My-Sails-Solo-is|website=Neil Young Archives|title=Through My Sails}}</ref> In January 2021, it was reported that Young had sold the rights to his back catalog to a British investment company. [[Hipgnosis Songs Fund]] had bought a 50 percent stake in Young's catalog, amounting to 1,800 songs from his Buffalo Springfield days, through the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young era and on to his solo career with the Crazy Horse backing band.

==Personal life==

=== Homes and residency ===
Young's family was from [[Manitoba]], where both his parents were born and married. Young himself was born in Toronto, Ontario, and lived there at various times in his early life (1945, 1957, 1959–1960, 1966 to 1967), as well as Omemee (1945 to 1952) and Pickering, Ontario (1956) before settling with his mother in Winnipeg, Manitoba (1958, 1960–1966), where his music career began and which he considers his "hometown".<ref>{{cite book|title="It's a Dream"|publisher=Prairie Wind|date=2005|author=Neil Young}}</ref> Young has been outside Canada since 1967.

=== Relationships and family ===
Young married his first wife, restaurant owner Susan Acevedo, in December 1968. They were together until October 1970, when she filed for divorce.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|pp=289, 349}}

From late 1970 to 1975, Young was in a relationship with actress [[Carrie Snodgress]]. The song "A Man Needs a Maid" from ''Harvest'' is inspired by his seeing her in the film ''[[Diary of a Mad Housewife]]''. They met soon afterward and she moved in with him on his ranch in northern California. They have a son, Zeke, who was born September 8, 1972. He has been diagnosed with [[cerebral palsy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Plummer |first=William |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086004,00.html |title='Mad Housewife' Carrie Snodgress Sues Rocker Neil Young for Support of Their Handicapped Son |journal=People |date=September 26, 1983 |volume=20 |issue=13 |access-date=April 11, 2015}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Young has long held that the digital audio formats in which most people download music are deeply flawed, and do not provide the rich, warm sound of analog recordings. He claims to be acutely aware of the difference, and compares it with taking a shower in tiny ice cubes versus ordinary water.{{sfn|McDonough|2002|p=568|ps=. "It hurts. Did you ever go in a shower and turn it on and have it come out tiny little ice cubes? That's the difference between CDs and the real thing – water and ice. It's like gettin' ''hit'' with somethin' instead of havin' it flow over ya. It's almost taking music and making a weapon out of it – do physical damage to people without touching them.

==Instruments==
===Guitars===
[[File:NeilYgretsch.jpg|thumb|Young playing a [[Gretsch White Falcon]] in Cologne, June 19, 2009]]

In 2003, ''Rolling Stone'' listed Young as eighty-third in its ranking of "The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time" (although in a more recent version of the list, he has been moved up to seventeenth place), describing him as a "restless experimenter&nbsp;... who transform[s] the most obvious music into something revelatory".<ref>{{cite news|title=100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time – Neil Young|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> Young is a collector of second-hand guitars, but in recording and performing, he uses frequently just a few instruments, as is explained by his longtime guitar technician [[Larry Cragg]] in the film ''[[Neil Young: Heart of Gold]]''. They include:
a late 1950s [[Gretsch White Falcon]] purchased by Young near the end of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] era. In 1969, he bought a stereo version of the same vintage guitar from Stephen Stills, and this instrument is featured prominently during Young's early 1970s period, and can be heard on tracks like "[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]", "[[Southern Man (song)|Southern Man]]", "Alabama", "Words (Between the Lines of Age)", and "L.A.". It was Young's primary electric guitar during the ''[[Harvest (Neil Young album)|Harvest]]'' (1972) era, since Young's deteriorating back condition (eventually fixed with surgery) made playing the much heavier Les Paul (a favourite of his named [[Old Black]]) difficult.<ref>David Simons, "Recording Harvest: The Making of Neil Young's Classic 1972 Album." ''Acoustic Guitar'' 103 (July 2001): 38–40.</ref>

===Reed organ===
Young owns a restored [[Estey Organ|Estey]] [[reed organ]], serial number 167272, dating from 1885, which he frequently plays in concert.<ref>''The Reed Society Quarterly'' (30.1: 6ff)</ref>

===Crystallophone===
Young owns a [[glass harmonica]] which was used in the recording of "I Do" on the 2019 album [[Colorado (Neil Young album)|Colorado]].<ref>Mountiantop Sessions</ref>

===Amplification===
Young uses various vintage [[Fender Tweed Deluxe]] [[amplifier]]s. His preferred amplifier for electric guitar is the Fender Deluxe, specifically a Tweed-era model from 1959. He purchased his first vintage Deluxe in 1967 for US$50 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|50|1967}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) from Sol Betnun Music on Larchmont in Hollywood and has since acquired nearly 450 different examples, all from the same era, but he maintains that it is the original model that sounds superior and is crucial to his trademark sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thrasherswheat.org/ptma/equip.htm|title=Neil Young's Equipment|publisher=Thrasherswheat.org|date=August 31, 1996|access-date=November 8, 2013}}</ref>

The Tweed Deluxe is almost always used in conjunction with a late-1950s [[Magnatone]] 280 (similar to the amplifier used by [[Lonnie Mack]] and [[Buddy Holly]]). The Magnatone and the Deluxe are paired together in a most unusual manner: the external speaker jack from the Deluxe sends the amped signal through a volume potentiometer and directly into the input of the Magnatone. The Magnatone is notable for its true pitch-bending vibrato capabilities, which can be heard as an electric piano amplifier on "See the Sky About to Rain". A notable and unique accessory to Young's Deluxe is the Whizzer, a device created specifically for Young by Rick Davis, which physically changes the amplifier's settings to pre-set combinations. This device is connected to footswitches operable by Young onstage in the manner of an [[effects pedal]]. Tom Wheeler's book Soul of Tone highlights the device on page 182/183.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/randybachman|title=BBC documentary Neil Young: Don't Be Denied – Randy Bachmann interviews|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>

==Legacy and awards==
[[File:Neil Young Star cropped.jpg|thumb|Young's star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]]]As one of the original founders of [[Farm Aid]] (1985–), he remains an active member of the board of directors. For one weekend each October, in [[Mountain View, California]], Young and his ex-wife hosted the [[Bridge School Benefit|Bridge School Concerts]], which drew international talent and sell-out crowds for nearly two decades. He announced in June 2017, however, that he would no longer host the concerts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bridgeschool.org/2017/06/no-bridge-school-benefit-concert-in-2017/|title=No Bridge School Benefit Concert in 2017|date=June 21, 2017|access-date=July 9, 2017}}</ref>

''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2000, ranked Young thirty-fourth in its list of the 100 greatest artists of all time,<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/neil-young-19691231|title=100 Greatest Artists of All Time|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=January 31, 2010|access-date=January 27, 2011}}</ref> and in 2003, included five of his albums in its list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060206184156/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 6, 2006|title=Greatest Albums of All Time &#124; Rolling Stone Music &#124; Lists|magazine=Rollingstone.com|access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref> In 2000, Young was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref name="cwof">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|title=Neil Young – 2000 Inductee|publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame|access-date=November 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604203513/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductees/00_neil_young.xml.htm|archive-date=June 4, 2008}}</ref>

In 2006, when ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' magazine compiled a "Greatest Living Songwriters" list, Young was ranked second behind [[Bob Dylan]]. (While Young and Dylan have occasionally played together in concert, they have never collaborated on a song together or played on each other's records.) He ranked thirty-ninth on ''[[VH1]]'s 100 Greatest Artist of Hard Rock'' that same year. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame explained that while Young has "avoided sticking to one style for very long, the unifying factors throughout Young's peripatetic musical journey have been his unmistakable voice, his raw and expressive guitar playing, and his consummate songwriting skill."<ref name="rockhall.com"/>

According to [[Acclaimed Music]], Young is the seventh-most celebrated artist in popular music history.<ref name="Acclaimed Music"/>

Young's political outspokenness and social awareness influenced artists such as [[Blind Melon]], [[Phish]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]. Young is referred to as "the Godfather of [[Grunge]]" because of the influence he had on [[Kurt Cobain]] and [[Eddie Vedder]] and the entire grunge movement. Vedder inducted Young into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1995, citing him as a huge influence. Young is cited as being a significant influence on the [[experimental rock]] group [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Thom Yorke]] of [[Radiohead]]. Yorke recounted of first hearing Young after sending a demo tape into a magazine when he was 16, who favorably compared his singing voice to Young's. Unaware of Young at that time, he bought ''[[After the Gold Rush]]'' (1970), and "immediately fell in love" with his work, calling it "extraordinary".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/musictv/neilyoung/video/thomyorke/|title=BBC – Neil Young: Don't be denied. – Video – Thom Yorke|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The Australian rock group [[Powderfinger]] named themselves after Young's song "[[Powderfinger (song)|Powderfinger]]" from ''[[Rust Never Sleeps]]'' (1979). The members of the [[Constantines]] have occasionally played Neil Young tribute shows under the name Horsey Craze.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jason Crock |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |title=Interviews: The Constantines |date=October 16, 2005 |website=Pitchfork.com |access-date=June 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105084641/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/31309-interview-the-constantines |archive-date=January 5, 2009}}</ref>

[[Jason Bond]], an [[East Carolina University]] biologist, discovered a new species of trapdoor spider in 2007 and named it ''[[Myrmekiaphila neilyoungi]]'' after Young,<ref name="bond2007">{{cite journal|author=[[Jason Bond|Jason E.

In 2001, Young was awarded the Spirit of Liberty award by the civil liberties group [[People for the American Way]]. Young was honored as the [[MusiCares Person of the Year]] on January 29, 2010, two nights prior to the 52nd Annual [[Grammy Awards]]. He was also nominated for two Grammy Awards: Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance for "Fork in the Road" and Best Boxed or Special Limited Edition Package for ''[[The Archives Vol. 1 1963–1972|Neil Young Archives Vol. 1 (1963–1972)]]''. Young won the latter Grammy Award. In 2010, he was ranked No.&nbsp;26 in Gibson.com's Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-526/|title=Top 50 Guitarists of All Time – 30 to 21|publisher=Gibson.com|access-date=November 29, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527234351/http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/Features/Top-50-Guitarists-526/|archive-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref>
