'''''Steven Universe''''' is an American [[animated series|animated television series]] created by [[Rebecca Sugar]] for [[Cartoon Network]]. It is Cartoon Network's first animated series to be created solely by a woman. The show tells the [[coming-of-age story]] of a young boy, [[Steven Universe (character)|Steven Universe]] ([[Zach Callison]]), who lives with the Crystal Gems—magical, humanoid aliens named [[Garnet (Steven Universe)|Garnet]] ([[Estelle (musician)|Estelle]]), [[Amethyst (Steven Universe)|Amethyst]] ([[Michaela Dietz]]), and [[Pearl (Steven Universe)|Pearl]] ([[Deedee Magno Hall]])—in the fictional town of Beach City. Steven, who is half-Gem, has adventures with his friends and helps the Gems protect the world from their own kind. Its pilot was first shown in May 2013, and the series ran for five seasons, from November 2013 to January 2019. The TV film ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]'' was released in September 2019, and an epilogue [[Limited series (television)|limited series]], ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', ran from December 2019 to March 2020.

The themes of the series include love, family, and the importance of healthy interpersonal relationships. Sugar based the lead character on her younger brother Steven, who was an artist for the series. She developed ''Steven Universe'' while she was a writer and storyboard artist on ''[[Adventure Time]]'', which she left when Cartoon Network commissioned her series for full production. The series is [[storyboard]]-driven; the show's storyboard artists were responsible for writing the dialogue and creating the action in addition to drawing the storyboards. Books, comics and video games based on the series have been released.

The series has developed a broad fanbase and has been critically acclaimed for its design, music, voice acting, characterization, prominence of [[LGBT|LGBTQ]] themes and [[science fantasy]] worldbuilding. The series won a [[GLAAD Media Award]] for [[GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Kids and Family Programming|Outstanding Kids & Family Program]] in [[30th GLAAD Media Awards|2019]], becoming the first animated series to win the award. It also received a [[Peabody Award]] for Children's & Youth Programming in 2019. It was nominated for five [[Primetime Emmy Award for Short-format Animation|Emmy Awards]] and five [[Annie Awards]].

==Synopsis==
''Steven Universe'' is set in the fictional town of Beach City, [[Delmarva]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|date=August 20, 2014|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213200144/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw4mo6|archive-date=December 13, 2015}}</ref> where the Crystal Gems live in an ancient beachside temple and protect humanity from monsters and other threats. The Gems are ageless alien warriors who project female humanoid forms from magical gemstones at the core of their being. The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven—a young, half-human, half-Gem boy who inherited his gemstone from his mother, the Crystal Gems' former leader Rose Quartz. As Steven tries to understand his gradually expanding range of powers, he spends his days accompanying the Gems on their missions, as well as interacting with his father Greg, his best friend Connie, his magical pet lion, and the other residents of Beach City. He explores the abilities inherited from his mother, which include fusion—the ability of Gems to merge their bodies and abilities to form new, more powerful personalities.

The series' first season gradually reveals that the Crystal Gems are remnants of a great interstellar empire. During their missions they visit ruins that were once important to Gem culture but have been derelict for millennia. The Gems are cut off from the Gem homeworld, and Steven learns that many of the monsters and artifacts they encounter are Gems who were corrupted by a Gem weapon of mass destruction and can no longer maintain rational, humanoid form. By the end of the first season, Steven learns that, millennia ago, the Gem empire intended to sterilize the Earth to incubate new Gems, but Rose Quartz led her supporters, the Crystal Gems, in a violent and apparently successful rebellion against this genocidal plan. The discovery and release of Lapis Lazuli, a Gem trapped on Earth for millennia, puts the Crystal Gems at risk from the Gem empire once more, leading to the arrival of hostile envoys Peridot and Jasper.

In the second season, Peridot allies with and eventually joins the Crystal Gems to prevent Earth's destruction by a Gem "geo-weapon" buried in the planet. During the third season, Lapis Lazuli decides to live on Earth with Peridot; Jasper is defeated and captured; and Steven learns that his mother assassinated one of the Gem empire's matriarchs, Pink Diamond. In the fourth season, as Steven wrestles with his conflicted feelings about his mother's actions, the Gem empire leaders Blue Diamond and Yellow Diamond begin to turn their full attention to Earth. In the fifth and final season, Steven learns that in fact his mother ''was'' Pink Diamond, who faked her death to assume the identity of Rose Quartz; he uses this revelation to persuade the other Diamonds to try to take responsibility for and fix the damage they have caused.

In 2011, after former Cartoon Network vice-president of comedy animation Curtis Lelash asked the staff for ideas for a new series, Rebecca Sugar—an artist working for the network's series ''[[Adventure Time]]''—described her initial ideas for what would become ''Steven Universe'', and the project was chosen for development. While developing her show, Sugar continued working on ''Adventure Time''.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=19}}</ref> The series evolved from a short story written by Sugar entitled "Ballad of Margo and Dread", about a sensitive child helping teenagers with problems they cannot verbalize.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=14}}</ref>

Cartoon Network executives commissioned the show after the crew's art presentation and Sugar became the first woman to create a show independently for the network.<ref name=":8">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=25}}</ref> Before a production team had been appointed, Sugar tried to alter elements of the show's plot and developed the character's identity so her crew would have the freedom she did when she worked for ''Adventure Time''.<ref name=":3">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=43}}</ref>

=== Development ===
When Sugar's show was commissioned, she resigned from her role as a storyboard artist on ''Adventure Time'' to focus on her own series.<ref name=":3" /> Sugar focused the pilot short on the main characters and their personalities to demonstrate the series' humor. The pilot is a [[Slice of life|slice-of-life]] episode that does not involve major events because the series' world was still in development.<ref name=":0" /> Sugar and her production team focused the plot on interaction between the Crystal Gems and Steven.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=24–25}}</ref> Sugar strove to make her pilot distinctive in terms of its artistic and aesthetic detail but was hampered by the time limit imposed upon her by Cartoon Network. The problems with the pilot helped Sugar develop the show's concept; she said, "to know that there is so much more that you can't see and the way that knowledge frustrates and excites and confuses and scares you".<ref name=":8" />

The title character Steven is loosely based on Steven Sugar, Rebecca's younger brother.<ref name="Cavna 2013-11-01" /> During ''Steven Universe''{{'s}} development, Sugar repeatedly asked her brother whether naming the show after him was a good idea; she stopped asking when it was commissioned. Her brother had no problem with it and trusted Sugar to use his name wisely.<ref name=":4" /> In an interview with the ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]],'' Sugar discussed developing the background of the show's protagonist, saying she wanted to base the character's viewpoint on her brother growing up "where you're so comfortable in your life because you get all the attention, but you also want to rise up and not be the little brother".<ref name="Ito 2013-07-26">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|title=Rising Animators Spring Into Motion|last=Ito|first=Robert|date=July 26, 2013|work=[[The New York Times]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130803055430/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/movies/rising-animators-spring-into-motion.html|archive-date=August 3, 2013|url-status=live|author2=Jeremy Egner}}</ref>

When the original pilot was presented to Cartoon Network executives, they told the crew the series would air in 2013.<ref name=":8" /> Cartoon Network released the original pilot in May 2013. Sugar and her team panicked because the series was going to be very different from the pilot episode. The pilot was popular when it was released, engendering forum discussions in which people expressed their hopes of seeing it on the air soon. Those who knew Rebecca Sugar from ''Adventure Time'' were also interested. Positive reaction to the show reassured its crew.<ref name=":9">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77}}</ref>

To prepare for the show's commissioning by Cartoon Network, Sugar began assembling a production crew.<ref name=":3" /> Jackie Buscarino was engaged as a producer in September 2012 and was tasked with hiring people and supervising the show's crew.<ref name=":5">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=48}}</ref> During this period of development, Sugar and her team were moved to a building behind the main Cartoon Network studio and based on the same floor as the crew of ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' CGI special. Some artists who had worked on the special, such as colorist Tiffany Ford and art directors Kevin Dart, Ellie Michalka and Jasmin Lai, were later invited to join the ''Steven Universe'' team.<ref name=":6">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=49}}</ref> Cartoon Network also provided Sugar with a list of suggested writers; when she saw Ben Levin and Matt Burnett (former writers for ''[[Level Up (U.S. TV series)|Level Up]]'') on the list she immediately asked them to join her team because she was familiar with their work.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=48–49}}</ref> Freelance artist Danny Hynes, whom the former supervising director Ian Jones-Quartey knew from his own project ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes|Lakewood Plaza Turbo]]'', became the show's lead character designer.<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=49; 54}}</ref> Steven Sugar was assigned as the background designer after his work on the original pilot,<ref name=":5" /> and was assisted by Dart, Michalka, Lai, background painter Amanda Winterston and others.<ref name=":7">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=55}}</ref>

During the art presentation, Jones-Quartey, Guy, Hynes and Steven Sugar created artwork that differed from their previous work. Jones-Quartey wanted to work with something new, retaining elements of the show's previous project.<ref name="McDonnell 2017 55; 60">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=55; 60}}</ref> He worked with Elle Michalka, who later took over his role as background painter for the presentation, to create concept art for an "action-comedy" series.<ref name=":4">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=60}}</ref> Around this time, Jones-Quartey added stars to the series' logo because he saw them as a versatile symbol. He later said he over-used them, and they were criticized at the art presentation.<ref name="McDonnell 2017 55; 60" /> The art presentation's drawings were by Rebecca Sugar, Jones-Quartey, Hynes, Paul Villeco (a writer and storyboard artist) and Steven Sugar. Michalka did the painting.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=62}}</ref>

=== Design ===
During the development of the ''Steven Universe'' pilot, Sugar focused much attention on the design of the world, adding notes to her drawings.<ref name=":1">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=20}}</ref> Inspired by the idea of foreign figures (Gems) living human lives, she drew many sketches depicting their world and history. The series' design was also inspired by her and her brother's interest in video games, comics and animation.<ref name=":0" /> After the series was commissioned, Sugar decided to redesign everything to make the series "flexible and simple" for future production staff to add ideas of their own.<ref name=":3" /> During this time, the art director was Kevin Dart, followed by Jasmin Lai, Elle Michalka, and Ricky Cometa.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=169}}</ref> Dart's artistic style has remained a great influence on the show long after his departure. Steven Sugar praised Dart's work and was inspired by him in college years, saying Dart had more ideas for the art than he did.<ref name=":7" />

In the pilot, only two locations appeared (the Temple and the Big Donut). The Temple was designed by Ian Jones-Quartey, Steven Sugar, Ben Levin, Matt Burnett, [[Tom Herpich]] and [[Andy Ristaino]]. The Temple's dual faces were based on Guy Davis' ideas.<ref name=":7" /> Steven Sugar designed the rest of Beach City for the series; he was painstaking in his attention to detail. Sugar also designed people, houses, cars, buildings and restaurants. Because of Rebecca Sugar's redesigned drawings, the two original locations had to be redrawn.<ref name=":6" />

To find inspiration for the show's backgrounds, the Sugars and Jones-Quartey went to their favorite beaches.<ref name=":7" /> The series' setting, Beach City, is loosely based on Delaware beaches [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]], [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]] and [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]], all of which Rebecca Sugar visited as a child.<ref name="Cavna 2013-11-01">{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |title='Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar is a Cartoon Network trailblazer |last=Cavna |first=Michael |date=November 1, 2013 |work=The Washington Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111171925/https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/tv/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-is-an-idealistic-trailblazer/2013/11/01/fe622da2-4338-11e3-a751-f032898f2dbc_story.html |archive-date=November 11, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Steven Sugar drew Beach City with a boardwalk lined with a variety of shops.<ref name=":6" /> He wanted it to have a "specific style" so viewers could believe it was based on a real location; he drew the roads and shops consistently oriented with the Temple and a water tower.<ref name=":7" /> The concept for the primary setting was inspired by [[Akira Toriyama]]'s ''[[Dr. Slump]]'', which features a small environment in which the recurring characters live where they work. Steven Sugar made the boardwalk the focus of ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s human world.<ref name=":6" />

=== Characters ===
{{main|List of Steven Universe characters}}
During the early stages of production, Sugar worked on character appearance and personality development simultaneously;<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=18}}</ref> during this process of conception, she was heavily inspired by fantasy television characters she and her brother used to draw when they were younger.<ref name=":0" /> Lead character designer Danny Hynes, influenced by the design of [[Mickey Mouse]] by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] artists, wanted the characters to be standardized, simple and recognizable.<ref name=":12">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=81}}</ref> He proposed 24 human characters to the crew; Rebecca and Steven Sugar drew 22 designs—13 of which were made official. The coloring was done by Jones-Quartey.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=52–53}}</ref> Rebecca Sugar merged several characters during the pilot development;<ref name=":0" /> supporting characters Lars and Sadie were originally created when she was in college.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150822171741/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvzqk3|archive-date=August 22, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The Pizza family was based on Jones-Quartey's [[Ghanaian people|Ghanaian]] family,<ref name=":7" /> and Ronaldo was created by Ben Levin and Matt Burnett.<ref name=":17" /> Guy Davis, a childhood friend of the Sugars, designed the early monsters and Gem architecture.<ref name=":7" />

Making a character "look alive" was always a priority in their design; according to Jones-Quartey, a character's emotions should be clearly delineated.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=150}}</ref> The character design team's mission is for the characters to resemble a classic cartoon such as 1940s Disney cartoons, ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' or the works of [[Osamu Tezuka]] and [[Harvey Kurtzman]]. In drawing the characters for each episode, the crew has two weeks to make modifications.<ref name=":12" /> Character names and some designs were inspired by types of food,<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=54–55}}</ref> and some characters were redesigned because the pilot revealed discrepancies between appearances and personalities.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=77; 80}}</ref> Sugar planned for the characters' designs to receive visual benchmarks so the show's artists can draw them consistently.<ref name=":11">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=80}}</ref> Sugar aimed to make the designs for her characters simple, flexible and consistent so the production team members would not become bogged down by over-complex details.<ref name=":12" /> This redesigning meant the appearances of the characters in the pilot episode differs substantially from their depiction in the television series.<ref name=":1" />

Sugar wanted the Gems to resemble humans; she developed the Crystal Gems to ride a roller coaster of family life with Steven,<ref name=":0" /> whom they would treat like a brother.<ref name=":2">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=9}}</ref> She wanted their gems to reflect their personalities; Pearl's perfect smoothness, Amethyst's coarseness and Garnet's air of mystery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyr7j|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111003100/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyr7j|archive-date=November 11, 2015}}</ref> According to Sugar, the Gems are "some version of me&nbsp;... neurotic, lazy, decisive".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw018y|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111001526/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjw018y|archive-date=November 11, 2015}}</ref> Their facial designs were influenced by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], who taught at the [[Bauhaus]] and encouraged his students to pair three primary colors—red, yellow and blue—with the three basic shapes—square, triangle and circle. Because of the characters' personalities, Garnet is square, Amethyst is a sphere and Pearl is a cone.<ref name=":11" /> Sugar wanted to give the Gems a superpower similar to those of classic cartoon characters such as [[Bugs Bunny]]. The Gems' ability to shape-shift is a reference to older cartoons such as [[Tex Avery]]'s work for [[MGM]], where characters would change at will. Although the Crystal Gems are intended to be serious characters, the writers wanted them to be "funny and weird" as well.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=148}}</ref>

==Production==
According to Sugar, production for ''Steven Universe'' began while she was working on ''Adventure Time'', her last episode for which was "[[Simon & Marcy]]". Working on both series simultaneously became impossible; she also encountered difficulty in the production of the episode "[[Bad Little Boy]]".<ref name="Kohn 2013-11-01">{{cite news|url=https://indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|title=''Adventure Time'' Writer Rebecca Sugar on ''Steven Universe'', Being Cartoon Network's First Female Show Creator And Why Pop Art Is 'Offensive'|last=Kohn|first=Eric|date=November 1, 2013|work=[[Indiewire]]|page=1|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103000634/http://www.indiewire.com/article/television/adventure-time-writer-rebecca-sugar-on-steven-universe|archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> Cartoon Network executives authorized the ''Steven Universe'' production crew to begin working after their pre-production presentation, for which the crew were well-prepared. The episodes "Cheeseburger Backpack" and "Together Breakfast" were developed at this time.<ref name=":4" /> Although Sugar works as executive producer on the series' art, animation and sound, she considers herself "the most hands on" at the storyboarding stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykrt|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111001454/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykrt|archive-date=November 11, 2015}}</ref>

The episode outlines are passed to the storyboarders, who create the action for the episode and write its dialogue.

=== Storyboard ===
[[File:Steven Universe storyboard from Island Adventure.png|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=Drawing of an anxious-looking character|Portion of the [[storyboard]] and script from the episode "Island Adventure". The series' storyboard artists are also its writers.]]
During storyboard meetings, artists draw their ideas on [[post-it note]]s, which are then attached to walls, table and boxes in the corners of their conference room. The drawings play a major role in forming episode ideas; Sugar looks at these designs and occasionally makes changes to key poses. Sugar likes to review and re-draw scenes and characters to add extra pathos and emotion to storyboards.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=207}}</ref> Each episode's storyboards are created by two artists, each of whom writes half of the dialogue and draws panels similar to comic strips. This process can be quite complex; the storyboard artists must create the [[cinematography]] and focus on [[scenic design]] in a way similar to film production. After the panels are made, the thumbnail-storyboard artists draw mannerisms and dialogue based on their own experiences; Sugar draws "quintessential" scenes from her memories of hanging out with her brother after school.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=118}}</ref> The storyboard artists then discuss their work with the rest of the crew and make any necessary changes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=119}}</ref> After the team discussion, the storyboard artists draw a revised board—based on the thumbnail board—on a full-size panel with notes. The storyboards are again discussed, corrected and finally approved.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=124}}</ref>

=== Writing ===
During the pilot development, Sugar wrote and sketched a number of plot ideas that later became episodes.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=21}}</ref> The series' initial premise focused mostly on Steven's human side, rather than his magic side, but the premise was later changed.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=43; 48}}</ref> Sugar developed the Gems' history in conjunction with the pilot episode.<ref name=":0" /> While the first season of the show introduced the human and Gem characters and their relationships, Sugar began to plot and explore second-season storylines involving the Crystal Gems.<ref name=":16">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=111}}</ref> Eventually, Sugar created a chart with taped printouts about a 2,000-year Gem and Earth history, with a number of events needing to be "fleshed out" for production. Although the series' overall plot is established, the writers improvise to arrive at its ending; according to Matt Burnett, the storylines will be resolved by the series' end.<ref name=":10">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=105}}</ref> Sugar wanted the series to focus on comedy and positivity before exploring controversial subjects involving the main characters, thinking it was "more honest" to begin the show with happiness instead of action or drama.<ref name=":0" />

The writers—formerly Levin and Burnett—would write the premises and outlines while the storyboarders wrote and drew the episodes.<ref name=":13">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=107}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ianjq.tumblr.com/post/74241332119/hey-i-am-a-screenwriting-student-from-emerson |title=Hey!

They discuss episode pacing and vary each season's texture by balancing "lighter" and "heavier" story arcs.<ref name=":17" /> Changes in major-character appearances—such as Yellow Diamond—in a storyline can be difficult for the writers.<ref name=":15" /> According to Ben Levin, writing a season of ''Steven Universe'' is like a "jigsaw puzzle" because the writing team must assemble a number of plot ideas, which are discarded if they do not benefit character growth. After further discussion and questions about the writing, an idea becomes an episode. After discussing a season's proposed episodes the "puzzle" is complete, and they begin writing a major story arc or a season finale. Burnett said writing a season is like an algebraic equation "where one side is the season finale, and the x's and y's are the episodes we need for that solution to make sense"; he cited "Ocean Gem", "[[Steven the Sword Fighter]]", "Monster Buddies", "An Indirect Kiss" and "Serious Steven" as examples. Those episodes led to the season-one finale as a minor story arc.<ref name=":17">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=106}}</ref> To develop new ideas for episodes, the writers play writing games. In one, a scenario with characters is drawn and passed to another writer. The second writer adds a few sentences before giving it to a third, until the drawing has a three-act story. Episodes such as "Island Adventure", "Future Boy Zoltron" and "Onion Friend" were written this way.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=107–108}}</ref> The writers also play drawing games, which design new Gem characters and technological ideas. Burnett said he and Levin use fewer ideas from the storyboarders than they previously did; storyboarders change fewer things than they did before because the episodes have a "stronger continuity".<ref name=":15" />

According to Levin, he and Burnett try to balance the focus between the main characters—with Steven in the center—and the theme of episodes in their writing. The balance indicates Steven has the same interests on his human side as he does on his Gem side. Levin said the Gem mythology and drama would have been less interesting if Steven was not as well-developed in the first few episodes. Grateful to work on a show which is unafraid to be "sincere and vulnerable", he said if every episode was emotional the series would become formulaic; happy episodes balance out emotional ones.<ref name=":17" /> Levin said he and Burnett have found ways to integrate Steven's powers into the plot. The character's powers and home-world technology are revealed at a "measured (very slow) pace", satisfying the viewer and keeping the series clear of superhero territory.<ref name=":15" />

Before significant plotlines air, the writers reveal information relevant to a "climactic" episode for the audience. According to storyboard artist Hilary Florido, much of the series' action and magic are narrative climaxes, demonstrating the characters' discoveries, difficulties and views. Florido said if a character's evolution is not directly related to the plot, there is no drama.<ref name=":15" /> The crew is discouraged from breaking perspective involving episode development as they want the audience to know the protagonist's point of view. Although the writers could hint at future events, they prefer to focus on plot and develop Steven in real time. Levin said if the pilot tried to present Gem history in five minutes, the audience and protagonist would be equally confused.<ref name=":14" />

=== Backgrounds ===
The production of background art begins after the approved storyboards are received. If the characters visit old locations, the pre-existing backgrounds are modified for authenticity; it is likely locations would change slightly over time. Steven Sugar likes to hide narrative bits in the backgrounds because he believes the key to world-building is "having a cohesive underlying structure to everything".<ref name=":22">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=174}}</ref> Former art director Elle Michalka said the backgrounds' artistic style was inspired by French post-impressionist painter [[Paul Cézanne]], whose apparent lack of focus belied detail and specificity. The art was also inspired by [[Tao Te Ching]], whose work highlights the importance of empty spaces, "like the space within a vase as being part of the vase that makes it useful".<ref name=":22"/> During the painting phase, the painters see the lines as "descriptive bones" and color is used loosely, meaning the color is intentionally slightly off register, highlighting the distinction between color and line.<ref name=":22"/> The painters used "superimposed" watercolor texture before switching to [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] because the former made the backgrounds "very chunky". When painting the backgrounds, they use one primary and several secondary colors; Amanda Winterston and Jasmin Lai found suitable color combinations. After the primary backgrounds are painted, they are sent to the color stylist, who chooses colors for a character or prop from model sheets, matching and complementing the storyboard and background. The lines of the character or prop are rarely colored. The lines are removed when scenes need light effects. The coloring in early season-one episodes was experimental because the stylist would have difficulty if a storyboard's character and background mixed together or a bright character walked unchanged into a shadow. Mistakes became rare as the crew planned and checked storyboards. The primary backgrounds are made in Burbank; the secondary ones by Korean artists.<ref name=":23">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=175}}</ref>

=== Animation ===
After the crew finishes constructing an episode, the production team sends it to animators in Korea. The animation is produced by [[Sunmin Image Pictures]] and [[Rough Draft Studios|Rough Draft Korea]]. The production team and animators communicate by email and sometimes use video chat when animating a major episode. Before sending the episode to one of the studios, animation director Nick DeMayo and his team create a plan for the animators after reviewing the [[Storyboard#Animatics|animatics]].<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=197}}</ref> They then add character movements on [[exposure sheet]]s to guide the animators. Mouth assignments for the characters, describing mouth shapes and timing for lip-syncing, follow.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=197–198}}</ref> The episode is then sent to one of the animation studios. The black-and-white version is sent first, followed about two weeks later by the colored version.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=198}}</ref> The animation is drawn and inked on paper, then scanned and colored digitally. The crew then arranges a "work print" meeting to discuss the episode and review it for errors. DeMayo notes any errors, removes them and sends the episode back to the animation studio or to Cartoon Network's post-production department to fix any remaining issues.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=199}}</ref> Minor animation mistakes or omissions are fixed by the crew.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=202}}</ref>

The show's four main voice actors—Callison, Dietz, Magno and Estelle—spend three to four hours recording per session; three to four weeks a month for ten months each year. Cast members record together or separately; they are often recording multiple episodes. Each recording session covers a new episode and includes retakes for that episode or previous ones if needed. In group recording sessions, a maximum of six actors stand in a semicircle.<ref name=":19">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=156}}</ref> Sugar and voice director [[Kent Osborne]] attend the sessions,<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=155–156}}</ref> advising the actors about voicing the characters in specific situations. If they like a take, the production assistant marks it and gives it to the animation editor for the episode's rough cut. When a recording session begins, Sugar explains the storyboards and describes the sequences, character intention and the relationship between them; Osborne does the recording. Before the sessions, Sugar and the voice actors discuss new plot elements and shows them the advanced storyboards. Magno said she enjoys the group recording sessions because the funny faces the cast members make while recording lines requiring emotion or movement often cause them to laugh.<ref name=":19" />

===Music===
''Steven Universe'' features songs and musical numbers produced by Sugar and her writers, who collaborate on each song's lyrics. Multiple drafts of the theme song's lyrics were written.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=22}}</ref> Sugar composed the extended theme song while waiting in line for a [[Airport security|security check]] at [[Los Angeles International Airport]].<ref name=":20" /> The series relies on [[leitmotif]]s for its soundtrack; instruments, genres and melodies are allotted to specific characters. The music is influenced by the works of [[Michael Jackson]] and Estelle;<ref name=":24">{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/steven-universe-composers-aivi-surrashu-interview|title=Dropping Gems: An Interview with the Composers of the Score for 'Steven Universe'|author=Eric Thurm|date=January 16, 2016|website=noisey.vice.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160814111713/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/steven-universe-composers-aivi-surrashu-interview|archive-date=August 14, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> and Sugar has cited [[Aimee Mann]] as "a huge influence".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyk5b|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111003057/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvyk5b|archive-date=November 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Sugar writes songs for the series during her travels, accompanying herself on a ukulele.<ref name=":20">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=160}}</ref> Not every episode features a song; according to Sugar, she uses them occasionally, to avoid forced creativity.<ref name="Kohn 2013-11-01" />

Most of the show's incidental music is composed by the [[chiptune]] piano duo [[Aivi & Surasshu]], with guitars by [[Stemage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stemagemusic.com/blog/category/heft|title=Heft!|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160708222330/http://www.stemagemusic.com/blog/category/heft|archive-date=July 8, 2016}}</ref> Jeff Liu, who was familiar with producer Aivi's musical score for the video game ''Cryamore'', recommended her to Sugar as a composer. Sugar asked Aivi to audition and agreed that producer Surasshu could join her.  Aivi & Surasshu scored a clip from "[[Gem Glow]]", the series' first episode; Sugar liked their work and hired them as series composers.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=161}}</ref> Before composing an episode, Aivi & Surasshu video chat with Sugar and the creative director to discuss the episode; they have a week to send Sugar a preview score.<ref name=":21">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=162}}</ref> After any necessary changes, Aivi & Surasshu send the score to Sabre Media Studios for the final mix with their sound designs.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=162–163}}</ref>

Each character has a leitmotif expressing their personality, which changes slightly depending on the situation.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=161–162}}</ref> Pearl is often accompanied by a piano, Garnet by a synth bass, Amethyst by a drum machine with electric bass and synths, and Steven with chiptune tones.<ref name=":24" /><ref name=":21" /> Sound palettes were produced for the human characters to represent the evolution of the series, its characters and their relationships. Sound motifs and palettes were also created for locations, objects and abstract concepts.<ref name=":21" /> When Sugar or the other writers write a song for an episode, they record a demo that is sent to the composers. The same musical style for a song and the character singing it is used for each song. Over time, the songs have become increasingly complex and production has become more difficult because the show's original musical style no longer fits perfectly with the newer lyrical themes. An example is "Here Comes a Thought", sung by Estelle and [[AJ Michalka]] (who voices Stevonnie). The two were less inspired by a specific musical style, but rather by the song's "feel", which Sugar had explained to them.<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=163}}</ref>

Beginning in 2015, Cartoon Network often aired new episodes in groups of five over one week—marketed as "Stevenbombs"—rather than one episode per week. The hiatuses between groups have irritated fans, according to ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' causing "agonized cries of a rabid, starving, pained cult following".<ref name="The A.V. Club 20 April 2016" /> The format, which is also used for other Cartoon Network series, has, in the website's view, contributed to the network's spikes in [[Google Trends]] associated with each "bomb". ''The A.V. Club'' attributed the effect to ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s unusual—for a youth cartoon—adherence to an overarching plot, which can generate "massive swells of online interest"—similar to the release of full seasons of adult TV series—which are "crucial to a network's vitality in an increasingly internet-based television world".<ref name="The A.V. Club 20 April 2016">{{cite news|last1=Blumenfeld|first1=Zach|title=Steven Universe's frustrating schedule is crucial to its success|url=https://avclub.com/article/steven-universes-frustrating-schedule-crucial-its--234864|work=The A.V.

In May 2018, Cartoon Network apologized to fans after one of the channel's promotional videos contained unaired footage with significant [[Spoiler (media)|spoilers]] for future episodes. In response to the video, former series producer [[Ian Jones-Quartey]] noted in a later-deleted tweet that "being a ''Steven Universe'' fan is suffering", alluding to the series' irregular and unpredictable airing schedule.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Polo|first1=Susana|title=Cartoon Network might have accidentally spoiled the end of Steven Universe (Update)|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2018/5/3/17315264/steven-universe-ending-spoilers-cartoon-network|access-date=5 May 2018|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=3 May 2018|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505204847/https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2018/5/3/17315264/steven-universe-ending-spoilers-cartoon-network|archive-date=May 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In an October 2020 art book for the series, Sugar stated that when clips from unaired episodes, giving away major spoilers, were leaked or those clips were used in official promotional videos, it was "very demoralizing for the crew."<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2020|p=85}}</ref>

From June 2, 2018 to July 29, 2018, ''Steven Universe'' aired re-runs on Cartoon Network's sister channel, [[Boomerang (TV channel)|Boomerang]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tvpassport.com/tv-listings/stations/boomerang-hd/16413/2018-06-02|archive-date=May 25, 2018|title=Boomerang Schedule – TV Passport|date=2 June 2018|access-date=31 May 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180525170453/https://www.tvpassport.com/tv-listings/stations/boomerang-hd/16413/2018-06-02|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

== Cancellation and sequels ==

According to Rebecca Sugar, she was notified in 2016 that the series would be cancelled at the end of the fifth season. She prevailed upon Cartoon Network to extend the fifth season to 32 episodes, in order to have room to complete the story, as well as a follow-up [[television film]], ''[[Steven Universe: The Movie]]''. Along with the film, Cartoon Network also greenlighted an additional season of 20 episodes, which would become the sequel series ''[[Steven Universe Future]]'', taking place after the events of the film.<ref name=ending /> Despite the show's end, Sugar has indicated that more stories could exist, but has stated that she needs a long break before deciding how to approach such a continuation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/27/21197679/steven-universe-future-ending-finale-new-seasons-rebecca-sugar-interview|title=The reason Rebecca Sugar made Steven Universe Future, and why it's the actual end|website=Polygon|last=Robinson|first=Tasha|date=March 27, 2020|access-date=March 27, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90480992/steven-universe-creator-rebecca-sugar-explains-the-series-finale-future-and-her-future|title='Steven Universe' creator Rebecca Sugar explains the series finale, 'Future'—and her future|last=Ifeanyi|first=K.

According to James Whitbrook of ''[[io9]]'', it is an "equally rewarding watch" for adults and children,<ref name="io9 16 June 2015" /> and Eric Thurm of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' has called it "one of the stealthiest, smartest, and most beautiful things on the air".<ref name="Wired 19 February 2015">{{cite news|last1=Thurm|first1=Eric|title=Steven Universe's new episode proves it's the best show you don't watch|url=https://www.wired.com/2015/02/steven-universe-best-show-youre-not-watching/|work=Wired|date=February 19, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708040214/http://www.wired.com/2015/02/steven-universe-best-show-youre-not-watching|archive-date=July 8, 2015}}</ref> Over the course of its run, ''Steven Universe'' has attracted a rapidly-growing fan base.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Paltridge|first1=Peter|title=SDCC: Cartoon Network Renews The Big Five|url=http://www.toonzone.net/2015/07/sdcc-cartoon-network-renews-the-big-five/|work=Toonzone|date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> In 2019, ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked ''Steven Universe'' #61 in its selection of the top 100 contemporary television series, describing the series as "groundbreaking" with an "uplifting, self-affirming message".<ref>{{cite web|website=TV Guide|url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/100-best-shows/|title=The 100 Best Shows Right Now|date=September 9, 2019|access-date=September 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190912195604/https://www.tvguide.com/news/100-best-shows/|archive-date=September 12, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Style and themes===
Sugar wanted ''Steven Universe'' to be thematically consistent with hers and her brother's shared interests.<ref name=":0">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=24}}</ref> As a coming-of-age series, the theme of family is important since Sugar based the titular character on her brother. Additionally, the theme of love was inspired by her relationship with Jones-Quartey.<ref name=":14">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=115}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|pp=124–125}}</ref> The series also expresses the importance of acceptance,<ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=125}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=224}}</ref> and explores relationships, [[LGBT]] identity, body shapes and "hues of skin in a colorful sci-fi magic display of diversity".<ref name=":25" /> According to Kat Morris, the series' central concepts are developed over time in an organic way, rather than being "overly calculated" from the start.<ref name=":25">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=128}}</ref> Former writer Matt Burnett said the series' simple-life theme prevented the inclusion of "cynicism" or "snarkiness".<ref name=":0" /> According to Burnett, the writers have no interest in a superhero theme.<ref name=":15">{{harvnb|McDonnell|2017|p=110}}</ref>

The unusually strong female presence in a series about a boy—all major characters except Steven and Greg are female—is intentional according to Sugar, who intended to "tear down and play with the [[semiotics]] of gender in cartoons for children", considering it "absurd" that shows for boys should be fundamentally different from those for girls.<ref name="ew">{{cite news|url=https://ew.com/article/2015/06/15/steven-universe-creator-growing-gender-politics-her-brother|title=Steven Universe creator Rebecca Sugar on growing up, gender politics and her brother|last1=Howe-Smith|first1=Nia|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|issue=June 15, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622204857/http://www.ew.com/article/2015/06/15/steven-universe-creator-growing-gender-politics-her-brother|archive-date=June 22, 2015}}</ref> She developed the series' plot towards a distant goal, with everything in between kept flexible, partly because her intentions have "changed since I've started because I've grown up a lot" while working on the show.<ref name="ew"/> Sugar described the series as "reverse escapism": the idea that fantasy characters would become interested in real life and would want to participate in it. Steven personifies the "love affair between fantasy and reality".<ref name="Hot Topic" /> Sugar said ''Steven Universe'' was influenced by the anime series ''[[Future Boy Conan]]'', ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykmy|title=I am Rebecca Sugar, creator of Steven Universe, and former Adventure Time storyboarder, AMA!|last1=Sugar|first1=Rebecca|date=August 20, 2014|website=[[Reddit]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151111001457/https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2e4gmx/i_am_rebecca_sugar_creator_of_steven_universe_and/cjvykmy|archive-date=November 11, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> 
''Steven Universe'', according to Eric Thurm, is a low-key, [[slice of life]] portrayal of childhood, an examination of unconventional family dynamics, a homage to [[anime]], video games and other pop-culture mainstays, and a "straightforward kids' show about superheroes".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Thurm|first1=Eric|title=Steven Universe: "Lion 2: The Movie"|url=https://avclub.com/tvclub/steven-universe-lion-2-movie-203778|date=April 23, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709164400/http://www.avclub.com/tvclub/steven-universe-lion-2-movie-203778|archive-date=July 9, 2015}}</ref> Jacob Hope Chapman of ''[[Anime News Network]]'' said the anime series ''[[Revolutionary Girl Utena]]'' and ''[[Sailor Moon]]'' are ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s strongest influences visually and structurally, reflected by its "predominantly playful tone, interrupted by crushing drama at key moments", and its "glorification of the strengths of femininity, dilution of gender barriers, and emphasis on a wide variety of relationships between women, aimed at a family audience".<ref name="ANN 31 July 2015">{{cite news|last1=Chapman|first1=Jacob Hope|title=Why Are Anime Fans Obsessed with Steven Universe?|url=https://animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-07-31/why-are-anime-fans-obsessed-with-steven-universe/.91130|work=Anime News Network|date=July 31, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304124437/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2015-07-31/why-are-anime-fans-obsessed-with-steven-universe/.91130|archive-date=March 4, 2016}}</ref> ''Steven Universe'' also refers to Japanese cultural icons, including ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'', ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', [[Studio Ghibli]] movies and [[Junji Ito]]'s horror manga ''[[The Enigma of Amigara Fault]]''.<ref name="ANN 31 July 2015" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/the-secret-school-the-alternative-japanese-high-school-world-of-steven-universe/|title=The Secret School: The Alternate Japanese High School World of Steven Universe|date=2016-02-19|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329120928/https://hornet.com/stories/the-secret-school-the-alternative-japanese-high-school-world-of-steven-universe/|archive-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Whitbrook, the series' "masterful sense of pace" allows it to integrate [[foreshadowing]] and [[worldbuilding]] into scenes, which makes an overarching, dramatic narrative emerge from what might otherwise be "[[Villain of the week|monster of the week]]" episodes.<ref name="io9 16 June 2015" /> The narration of a complex story from a child's perspective means its [[Exposition (narrative)|exposition]] remains "artfully restrained, growing in ambition with the series" and Steven's character.<ref name="Wired 19 February 2015" /> ''Steven Universe''{{'}}s measured pace allows its characters to become "more complex and interesting than most of their counterparts on prestige dramas",<ref name="A.V.

Club 15 June 2015" /> Its action scenes—such as Estelle's song presenting the climactic fight in "[[Jail Break (Steven Universe)|Jail Break]]" as a contest between Garnet's loving relationship and Jasper's lone-wolf attitude—are occasionally cast as philosophical arguments.<ref name="A.V.

====Characters====
{{main|List of Steven Universe characters}}
Adams highlighted the "groundbreaking and inventive" portrayal of the complicated "mentor/caregiver/older sibling dynamic" between Steven and the Crystal Gems<ref name="A.V. Club 4 November 2015" /> in a series which, at its core, is about sibling relationships.<ref name="A.V. Club 11 November 2013" /> Thurm wrote that a notable emotional difference between ''Steven Universe'', and ''Adventure Time'' and ''[[Regular Show]]'', is that the latter two series deal with their protagonists' transitions to adulthood whereas during its first season, ''Steven Universe'' was content to be "enamored with the simplicity of childhood".<ref name="A.V. Club 9 April 2014" /> Steven slowly grows from being an obnoxious, tag-along child to an accepted member of the Crystal Gems in his own right by the end of the first season, a change brought about by increased insight and experience rather than age.<ref name="A.V. Club 12 March 2015" /> Joe Cain noted in ''[[The Mary Sue]]'' that unlike heroes from antiquity ([[Hercules]]) and modern fiction ([[Luke Skywalker]]), Steven is defined by his mother's legacy rather than his father's; the preponderance of mother figures in the series underscores their rarity in other fiction.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cain|first1=Joseph|title=Superheroes, Steven Universe, and the Maternal Narrative|url=http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|work=The Mary Sue|date=May 13, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514112356/http://www.themarysue.com/steven-universe-maternal-narrative/|archive-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref> According to Kat Smalley of [[PopMatters]], the Gems' alien nature, which prevents them from fully understanding the world they protect, is handled with "remarkable depth and intellectual rigor", even as they deal with human issues such as "[[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress]], and self-loathing" remaining from the long-past war for Earth.<ref name="Pop Matters 15 January 2016">{{Cite news |url=https://popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |title='Steven Universe': Cartoon Network's Avant-Garde Animation |last=Smalley |first=Kat |date=January 15, 2016 |work=[[Pop Matters]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170906004121/http://www.popmatters.com/feature/steven-universe-cartoon-networks-avant-garde-animation/ |archive-date=September 6, 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Smalley characterized ''Steven Universe'' as part of a growing trend of cartoons that appeal to adults and children alike, which includes ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' (2005), its sequel ''[[The Legend of Korra]]'' (2012), ''Adventure Time'' (2010) and ''Regular Show'' (2010). This is reflected in the series' outreach to minorities that seldom appear elsewhere in animation and its broader themes: instead of delivering genre-typical, mustache-twirling villains, ''Steven Universe'' "deals with issues of extraordinary violence and horror, depicts its characters in shades of grey, and subtly plays with matters of philosophy, morality, and interpersonal conflicts, all while refusing to reset any development to a ''status quo''".<ref name="Pop Matters 15 January 2016" />

====Gender and sexuality====

Their past relationship is gradually seen to affect Pearl's relationship with Steven and those around him.]]

"Gender is at the forefront of the conversation surrounding ''Steven Universe''", according to Erik Adams of the ''A.V. Club'', who noted that "the show's superheroes are all women".<ref name="A.V. Club 4 November 2015" /> As a self-aware pastiche of [[magical girl]] anime, the series subverts the genre's premises by having Steven embody the loving femininity of the typical magical-girl protagonist without ridicule or losing his masculine side. Whitbrook characterized the series as being "about love—''all'' kinds of love", including non-traditional forms such as the motherly and friendly bond between Steven and the Gems, and Garnet as the "physical embodiment of a lesbian relationship".<ref name="io9 16 June 2015" />

When placing the series on the honor list of the 2015 [[James Tiptree Jr. Award|Tiptree Award]], which recognizes works of science fiction or fantasy that explore and expand gender roles, the jury wrote: "In the context of children's television, this show deals with gender in a much more open and mature way than is typical for the genre, and has some of the best writing of any cartoon&nbsp;... In addition to showing men and women who do not necessarily conform to standard American gender ideals, the show also gives us an agender/non-binary character and a thoughtful exploration of growing up".<ref name="Tiptree 2016" />

In 2015, [[Autostraddle]]'s Mey Rude wrote that ''Steven Universe'' was the most-recent animated series for a younger audience with significant [[queer]] themes, such as the  [[Androgyny|androgynous]] fusion [[Stevonnie]] and the romantic relationship between the Gems Ruby and Sapphire, whose fusion is the main character Garnet. This, according to Rude, reflects the growing prominence of these themes in children's cartoons; previous depictions were subtextual or minimal, such as the 2011 ''Adventure Time'' episode "[[What Was Missing]]", the 2014 series ''[[Clarence (2014 TV series)|Clarence]]'' or (more explicit but unexplored) the 2014 finale of Nickelodeon's ''[[The Legend of Korra]]''. In ''Steven Universe'', [[LGBT]] themes are prominent as early as the first season's second half.<ref>{{cite news|last=Rude|first=Mey|title="Steven Universe" and the Importance of All-Ages Queer Representation|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/steven-universe-and-the-importance-of-all-ages-queer-representation-281482/|work=[[Autostraddle]]|date=March 13, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725084959/https://www.autostraddle.com/steven-universe-and-the-importance-of-all-ages-queer-representation-281482/|archive-date=July 25, 2015}}</ref> The fifth season's engagement and wedding between Ruby and Sapphire was reportedly the first [[same-sex marriage]] proposal in a children's animated series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.teenvogue.com/story/steven-universe-is-reportedly-first-cartoon-to-feature-same-sex-engagement|title="Steven Universe" Just Made Queer History With a Same-Sex Engagement|first=Lauren|last=Rearick|work=Teen Vogue|date=July 6, 2018|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180708044708/https://www.teenvogue.com/story/steven-universe-is-reportedly-first-cartoon-to-feature-same-sex-engagement|archive-date=July 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/07/05/steven-universe-same-sex-marriage-proposal-the-question/|title=Steven Universe shows a groundbreaking same-sex marriage proposal|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Nick|last=Romano|date=July 5, 2018|access-date=July 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180705220246/http://ew.com/tv/2018/07/05/steven-universe-same-sex-marriage-proposal-the-question/|archive-date=July 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

According to Sugar, her series' LGBT representation is not intended to make a point but to help children understand themselves and develop their identities. In her view, queer youth deserve to see themselves in stories as much as other children—and, given pervasive [[heteronormativity]], not allowing them to do so can be harmful.

Sugar said that she began to talk publicly about why she "felt so strongly that kids deserve these stories" and won with the "support of Steven Universe’s young fans and the muscle of [[GLAAD]] behind them."

In June 2021, Taneka Stotts, a [[genderfluid]] writer for ''Steven Universe: Future'' told [[Insider (website)|Insider]] that Sugar "went out of the way to make sure that their show was [staffed] as inclusive as possible", hiring talented people notice on Tumblr and Twitter instead of industry regulars. Sugar said that being at the forefront of LGBTQ representation meant that beyond what they were creating there was "very little queer content". She also said that apart from threats and backlash from [[homophobic]] viewers, she feared that her identity and content in the show could lead to its cancellation if she spoke about it openly, noting that support for the show was "often very qualified and hurtful". She also noted that non-binary creators such as herself have additional challenges, going through a world were non-binary people are dehumanized, and hoped that "visible queer content and multiple queer creators means no one has to feel isolated" in the ways that she did.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Chik|first1=Kalai|last2=White|first2=Abbey|url=https://www.insider.com/queer-women-transgender-nonbinary-kids-animation-cartoons-2021-6|title=Animation's queer women, trans, and nonbinary creatives are pushing gender boundaries in kid's cartoons their counterparts couldn't—or wouldn't dare|date=June 30, 2021|website=[[Insider (website)|Insider]]|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210702034400/https://www.insider.com/queer-women-transgender-nonbinary-kids-animation-cartoons-2021-6?utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=2021-q2-special_projects&utm_content=lgbtq|archive-date=July 2, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref> The same month, Sugar told [[NPR]] that she wanted "little boys to experience girl show things" and vice versa, and for "nonbinary, gender-expansive kids to have a show".<ref>{{cite web|last=Whitley-Berry|first=Victoria|url=https://www.npr.org/2021/06/30/1011310695/after-decades-in-the-background-queer-characters-step-to-the-front-in-kids-media|title=After Decades In The Background, Queer Characters Step To The Front In Kids' Media|date=June 30, 2021|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=July 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210703022635/https://www.npr.org/2021/06/30/1011310695/after-decades-in-the-background-queer-characters-step-to-the-front-in-kids-media|archive-date=July 3, 2021|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2021, Abbey White, a non-binary reporter for [[Insider (website)|Insider]] and [[The Hollywood Reporter]], told The Hollywood Reporter's "Hollywood Remixed" podcast that the whole idea behind the show is "an upending of gender expectation," with Steven as a "gender nonconforming boy" with a family of "feminine non-binary, non-gendered aliens," saying this is "laced in very conscious, purposeful ways throughout the entire series."<ref>{{cite podcast |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/hollywood-remixed-billions-asia-kate-dillon-1235012146/ |title=‘Hollywood Remixed’: ‘Billions’ Star Asia Kate Dillon on How Non-Binary Representation Changes Lives |website=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter, LLC |host=Rebecca Sun |date=September 11, 2021 |time= |access-date=September 12, 2021}}</ref>

=== Music ===
Aivi Tran and Steven "Surasshu" Velema's chiptune-inspired music has also been praised in reviews: Oliver Sava of ''The A.V.

The series' music has also been widely praised. "Stronger Than You" has been referred to as a "queer fight song", and the end credits song, "Love Like You", has also been called worthy of being "the latest addition to the [[Great American Songbook]]".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/stronger-than-you/|title=The Heartwarming 'Stronger Than You' Video From 'Steven Universe' Could Be the Next Queer Fight Song|date=2017-07-27|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329120931/https://hornet.com/stories/stronger-than-you/|archive-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hornet.com/stories/best-steven-universe-songs/|title=Still Not Giving Up: 5 More of the Best 'Steven Universe' Songs|date=2017-06-11|work=Hornet Stories|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121021/https://hornet.com/stories/best-steven-universe-songs/|archive-date=March 29, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2019, [[Ian Jones-Quartey]], who left the show in 2015 to develop his own show (''[[OK K.O.!

In June 2021, a former [[Cartoon Network]] executive, Katie Krentz, said part of a shift more inclusion in animation, might be due, in part, to events at [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]], giving the example of rooms at Comic-Con filled up with Steven Universe fans in their 20s, 30s, and 40s.<ref>{{cite web|last=White|first=Abbey|url=https://www.insider.com/why-tv-lacks-lgbtq-inclusion-according-to-experts-2021-6|title=TV animators were forced to scrap LGBTQ-inclusive storylines due to a culture of fear.
