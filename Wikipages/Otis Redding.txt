'''Otis Ray Redding Jr.''' (September 9, 1941 – December 10, 1967) was an American singer and songwriter. He is considered one of the greatest singers in the history of American [[popular music]] and a seminal artist in [[soul music]] and [[rhythm and blues]]. Nicknamed the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Soul]]", Redding's style of singing gained inspiration from the gospel music that preceded the genre. His singing style influenced many other soul artists of the 1960s<!-- ? V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, eds., ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd ed., 2002), {{ISBN|0-87930-653-X}}?</ref> -->.

Redding was born in [[Dawson, Georgia]], and at age two, moved to [[Macon, Georgia]]. Redding quit school at age 15 to support his family, working with [[Little Richard]]'s backing band, [[The Upsetters (American band)|the Upsetters]], and by performing in talent shows at the historic Douglass Theatre in Macon. In 1958, he joined [[Johnny Jenkins]]'s band, the Pinetoppers, with whom he toured the Southern states as a singer and driver. An unscheduled appearance on a [[Stax Records|Stax]] recording session led to a contract and his first hit single, "[[These Arms of Mine (Otis Redding song)|These Arms of Mine]]", in 1962.

Stax released Redding's debut album, ''[[Pain in My Heart]]'', two years later. Initially popular mainly with African-Americans, Redding later reached a wider American pop music audience. Along with his group, he first played small shows in the American South. Redding later performed at the popular Los Angeles night club [[Whisky a Go Go]] and toured Europe, performing in London, Paris and other major cities. He also performed at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967.

Shortly before his death in a plane crash, Redding wrote and recorded his iconic "[[(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay]]" with [[Steve Cropper]]. The song became the first posthumous number-one record on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Billboard Hot R&B|R&B]] charts. The album ''[[The Dock of the Bay (album)|The Dock of the Bay]]'' was the first [[List of posthumous number ones on the UK Albums Chart|posthumous album to reach number one on the UK Albums Chart]]. Redding's premature death devastated Stax. Already on the verge of bankruptcy, the label soon discovered that the [[Atco Records|Atco]] division of [[Atlantic Records]] owned the rights to his entire song catalog.

Redding received many posthumous accolades, including two [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] and induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], the [[Black Music and Entertainment Walk of Fame|Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-02-18|title=Black Music & Entertainment Walk of Fame Announced With First Three Inductees|url=http://www.billboard.com/amp/articles/news/9528154/black-music-entertainment-walk-of-fame-announced-atlanta|access-date=2021-04-15|website=www.billboard.com|language=en}}</ref> and the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]]. In addition to "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay," "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]" and "[[Try a Little Tenderness]]" are among his best-known songs.

==Early life==
Redding was born in [[Dawson, Georgia]], the fourth of six children, and the first son of Otis Redding Sr. and Fannie Roseman. Redding Sr. was a [[sharecropper]] and then worked at [[Robins Air Force Base]], near [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], and occasionally preached in local churches. When Redding was three, the family moved to Tindall Heights, a predominantly African-American public housing project in Macon.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=164–167}} At an early age, he sang in the [[Vineville Baptist Church]] choir and learned guitar and piano. From age 10, Redding took drum and singing lessons. At [[Ballard-Hudson High School]], he sang in the school band. Every Sunday he earned $6 by performing gospel songs for Macon radio station [[WIHB (AM)|WIBB]],{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=40}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=10}} and he won the $5 prize in a teen talent show for 15 consecutive weeks.<ref>Wall Street Journal; "Singing You Out of Your Shoes"; Dean, Eddie; May 27, 2017</ref>  His passion was singing, and he often cited [[Little Richard]] and [[Sam Cooke]] as influences. Redding said that he "would not be here" without Little Richard and that he "entered the music business because of Richard – he is my inspiration. I used to sing like Little Richard, his rock 'n' roll stuff ... My present music has a lot of him in it."{{sfn|White|2003|p=229}}{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=395–396}}

At age 15, Redding left school to help financially support his family; his father had contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was often hospitalized, leaving his mother as the family's primary income earner.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=164–167}} He worked as a well digger, as a gasoline station attendant and occasionally as a musician. Pianist Gladys Williams, a locally well-known musician in Macon and another who inspired Redding, often performed at the Hillview Springs Social Club, and Redding sometimes played piano with her band there.{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=11}} Williams hosted Sunday talent shows, which Redding attended with two friends, singers [[Little Willie Jones]] and Eddie Ross.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=397–399}}

Redding's breakthrough came in 1958 on disc jockey [[Hamp Swain]]'s "The Teenage Party," a talent contest at the local Roxy and [[Douglass Theatre]]s.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=167–168}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=10}} [[Johnny Jenkins]], a locally prominent guitarist, was in the audience and, finding Redding's backing band lacking in musical skills, offered to accompany him. Redding sang Little Richard's "Heebie Jeebies." The combination enabled Redding to win Swain's talent contest for fifteen consecutive weeks; the cash prize was $5 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1958}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}).{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=166}} Jenkins later worked as lead guitarist and played with Redding during several later gigs.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=168}} Redding was soon invited to replace Willie Jones as [[Lead vocalist|frontman]] of Pat T. Cake and the Mighty Panthers, featuring Johnny Jenkins.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=397–399}} Redding was then hired by the Upsetters when [[Little Richard]] abandoned [[rock and roll]] in favor of [[gospel music]]. Redding was well paid, making about $25 per gig (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25|1958}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}),{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=164–167}}{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=40}} but did not stay long.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|p=398}} In mid-1960, Otis moved to Los Angeles with his sister, Deborah, while his wife Zelma and their children stayed in Macon, Georgia.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/05/13/528116058/otis-reddings-unfinished-life-still-resonates|title=Otis Redding's 'Unfinished Life' Still Resonates|website=NPR.org|access-date=May 14, 2017}}</ref> In Los Angeles Redding recorded his first songs, including "Tuff Enuff" written by James McEachin, "She's All Right," written with McEachin, and two Redding wrote alone, called "I'm Gettin' Hip" and "Gamma Lamma" (which he recorded as a single in 1961, under the title "Shout Bamalama").{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=40}}

==Career==
===Early career===
A member of Pat T. Cake and the Mighty Panthers, Redding toured the Southern United States on the [[Chitlin' Circuit]], a string of venues that were hospitable to African-American entertainers during the [[Racial segregation in the United States|era of racial segregation]], which lasted into the early 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtoninformer.com/index.php/business/item/6325-the-howard-theatre-the-peoples-place|title=The Howard Theatre: "The People's Place"|author=Reed, William|publisher=Washington Informer|date=April 26, 2012|access-date=May 14, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521185054/http://washingtoninformer.com/index.php/business/item/6325-the-howard-theatre-the-peoples-place|archive-date=May 21, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Johnny Jenkins]] left the band to become the featured artist with the Pinetoppers.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=400–401}} Around this time, Redding met [[Phil Walden]], the future founder of the recording company Phil Walden and Associates, and later Bobby Smith, who ran the small label Confederate Records. He signed with Confederate and recorded a single, "Shout Bamalama" (a rewrite of "Gamma Lamma") and "Fat Girl", together with his band Otis and the Shooters.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=40}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=159}} Around this time he and the Pinetoppers attended a "Battle of the Bands" show in Lakeside Park.{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=16}} [[Wayne Cochran]], the only solo artist signed to Confederate, became the Pinetoppers' bassist.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=400–401}}

When Walden started to look for a record label for Jenkins, [[Atlantic Records]] representative [[Joe Galkin]] showed interest and around 1962 sent him to the [[Stax Records|Stax]] studio in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]]. Redding drove Jenkins to the session, as the latter did not have a driver's license.<ref name="Staxabout">{{cite web|url=http://www.staxmuseum.com/about/artists/view/otis-redding|publisher=Stax Museum of American Soul Music|access-date=September 26, 2011|title=Otis Redding|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111014184737/http://www.staxmuseum.com/about/artists/view/otis-redding|archive-date=October 14, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> The session with Jenkins, backed by [[Booker T. & the M.G.'s]], was unproductive and ended early; Redding was allowed to perform two songs. The first was "Hey Hey Baby", which studio chief [[Jim Stewart (music)|Jim Stewart]] thought sounded too much like Little Richard. The second was "These Arms of Mine", featuring Jenkins on guitar and [[Steve Cropper]] on piano. Stewart later praised Redding's performance, saying, "Everybody was fixin' to go home, but Joe Galkin insisted we give Otis a listen. There was something different about [the ballad]. He really poured his soul into it."{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=401–408}}{{sfn|Freeman|2002|p=77}} Stewart signed Redding and released "These Arms of Mine", with "Hey Hey Baby" on the [[B-side]]. The single was released by Volt in October 1962 and charted in March the following year.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=175}} It became one of his most successful songs, selling more than 800,000 copies.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|p=396}}

"These Arms of Mine" and other songs from the 1962–1963 sessions were included on Redding's debut album, ''[[Pain in My Heart]]''. "That's What My Heart Needs" and "Mary's Little Lamb" were recorded in June 1963. The latter is the only Redding track with both background singing and brass. It became his worst-selling single.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=175}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|pp=39–40}} The title track, recorded in September 1963, sparked copyright issues, as it sounded like [[Irma Thomas]]'s "Ruler of My Heart".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=175}} Despite this, ''Pain in My Heart'' was released on March <!--17,{{not in citation|date=September 2019}}--> 1964,<ref>{{cite news |title=Billboard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCIEAAAAMBAJ&q=%22Atco+161%22&pg=PT1 |publisher=Billboard Advertising |date=March 21, 1964}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Gould |first1=Jonathan |title=Otis Redding: An Unfinished Life |date=2017 |publisher=Crown Archetype |location=New York |isbn=978-0307453969 |page=250 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zs7hDAAAQBAJ&q=%22pain%22+my+heart%22+%22March%22&pg=PA250}}</ref> with the single peaking at number 11 on the R&B chart, number 61 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, and the album at number 103 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Otis Redding|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/otis-redding/chart-history/hsi/|access-date=November 13, 2020|website=Billboard}}</ref>

In November 1963, Redding, accompanied by his brother Rodgers and an associate, former boxer Sylvester Huckaby (a childhood friend of Redding's), traveled to New York to perform at the [[Apollo Theater]] for the recording of a live album for Atlantic Records. Redding and his band were paid $400 per week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|400|1963}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) but had to pay $450 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|450|1963}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for sheet music for the house band, led by [[King Curtis]], which left them in financial difficulty. The trio asked Walden for money. Huckaby's description of their circumstances living in the "big old raggedy" Hotel Theresa is quoted by Peter Guralnick in his book ''Sweet Soul Music''. He noted meeting [[Muhammad Ali]] and other celebrities. [[Ben E. King]], who was the headliner at the Apollo when Redding performed there, gave him $100 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100|1963}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) when he learned about Redding's financial situation. The resulting album featured King, [[the Coasters]], [[Doris Troy]], [[Rufus Thomas]], [[the Falcons]] and Redding.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=175–176}} Around this time Walden and Rodgers were drafted by the army; Walden's younger brother Alan joined Redding on tour, while Earl "Speedo" Simms replaced Rodgers as Redding's road manager.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=177–179}}

Most of Redding's songs after "Security", from his first album, had a slow tempo. Disc jockey A. C. Moohah Williams accordingly labeled him "Mr. Pitiful",{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=183}} and subsequently, Cropper and Redding wrote the [[Mr. Pitiful|eponymous song]].{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=401–408}} That and top 100 singles " Chained and Bound", "Come to Me" and "That's How Strong My Love Is"<ref name="awards">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/otis-redding-p5246/charts-awards|title=Otis Redding – Awards|publisher=Allmusic.

That summer, Redding and the studio crew arranged new songs for his next album. Ten of the eleven songs were recorded in a 24-hour period on July 9 and 10 in Memphis. Two songs, "[[Ole Man Trouble]]" and "[[Respect (song)|Respect]]", had been finished earlier, during the ''Otis Blue'' session. "Respect" and "I've Been Loving You" were later recut in stereo. The album, entitled ''[[Otis Blue: Otis Redding Sings Soul]]'', was released in September 1965.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/151464-/|work=Popmatters|publisher=SPIN Music Group|access-date=November 21, 2012|title=Counterbalance No. 61: 'Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul'|author1=Mendelsohn, Jason|author2=Klinger, Eric|date=December 9, 2011}}</ref> ''Otis Blue'' also includes Redding's much-loved cover of "A Change Is Gonna Come" in 1965.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Otis Blue/Otis Redding Sings Soul|url=https://otisredding.com/albums/otis-blueotis-redding-sings-soul/|access-date=November 13, 2020|website=Otis Redding|language=en-US}}</ref>

Redding's success allowed him to buy a {{convert|300|acre|km2|adj=on}} ranch in Georgia, which he called the "Big O Ranch."<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://otisredding.com/bio/bio/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20101126083955/http://otisredding.com/bio/bio/|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 26, 2010|title=Biography|access-date=August 3, 2011|publisher=Otis Redding Official Website}}</ref> Stax was also doing well. Walden signed more musicians, including [[Percy Sledge]], [[Johnnie Taylor]], [[Clarence Carter]] and [[Eddie Floyd]], and together with Redding, they founded two production companies. "Jotis Records" (derived from ''J''oe Galkin and ''Otis'') released four recordings, two by [[Arthur Conley]] and one by Billy Young and Loretta Williams. The other was named Redwal Music (derived from ''Red''ding and ''Wal''den), which was shut down shortly after its creation.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=59}} Since Afro-Americans still formed the majority of fans, Redding chose to perform at Whisky a Go Go on the [[Sunset Strip]] in Los Angeles. Redding was one of the first soul artists to perform for rock audiences in the western United States. His performance received critical acclaim, including positive press in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and he penetrated mainstream popular culture. [[Bob Dylan]] attended the performance and offered Redding an altered version of one of his songs, "[[Just Like a Woman]]".{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=401–408}}

In late 1966, Redding returned to the Stax studio and recorded several tracks, including "[[Try a Little Tenderness]]", written by [[Jimmy Campbell and Reg Connelly|Jimmy Campbell, Reg Connelly]] and [[Harry M. Woods]] in 1932.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=105}}  This song had previously been recorded by [[Bing Crosby]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], and the publishers unsuccessfully tried to stop Redding from recording the song from a "negro perspective".  Today often considered his [[signature song]],{{sfn|Inglis|2006|pp=28–38}}  Jim Stewart reckoned, "If there's one song, one performance that really sort of sums up Otis and what he's about, it's 'Try a Little Tenderness'.  That one performance is so special and so unique that it expresses who he is."  On this version Redding was backed by Booker T. & the M.G.'s, while staff producer [[Isaac Hayes]] worked on the arrangement.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=105–107}}{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=408–410}}  "Try a Little Tenderness" was included on his next album, ''[[Complete & Unbelievable: The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul]]''.  The song and the album were critically and commercially successful—the former peaked at number 25 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and at number 4 on the R&B chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/complete-unbelievable-the-otis-redding-dictionary-of-soul-mw0000268175|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|access-date=August 17, 2011|title=Complete & Unbelievable: The Otis Redding Dictionary of Soul}}</ref>

The spring of 1966 marked the first time that Stax booked concerts for its artists.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=117}} The majority of the group arrived in London on March 13,{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=408–410}}{{sfn|Brown|2001|pp=116–117}} but Redding had flown in days earlier for interviews, such as at "The Eamonn Andrews Show".  When the crew arrived in London, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] sent a [[limousine]] to pick them up.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=117}}  Booking agent [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] proposed that Redding play at the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] in late 1966.  The gig was commercially and critically successful, paying Redding around $800 to $1000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1000|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) a night.{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=117}}{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=408–410}} It prompted Graham to remark afterward, "That was the best gig I ever put on in my entire life."{{sfn|Graham|Greenfield|2004|p=173}} Redding began touring Europe six months later.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=103}}

===Carla Thomas===
In March 1967, Stax released ''[[King & Queen]]'', an album of duets between Redding and [[Carla Thomas]], which became a certified gold record. It was Jim Stewart's idea to produce a duet album, as he expected that "[Redding's] rawness and [Thomas's] sophistication would work".{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=110–111}} The album was recorded in January 1967, while Thomas was earning her M.A. in English at [[Howard University]]. Six out of ten songs were cut during their joint session; the rest were overdubbed by Redding in the days following, because of his concert obligations. Three singles were lifted from the album: "[[Tramp (song)|Tramp]]" was released in April, followed by "[[Knock on Wood (Eddie Floyd song)|Knock on Wood]]" and "Lovey Dovey". All three reached at least the top 60 on both the R&B and Pop charts.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=110–111}} The album charted at number 5 and 36 on the ''Billboard'' Pop and R&B charts, respectively.<ref name="awards"/>

Redding returned to Europe to perform at the [[Paris Olympia]]. The live album ''[[Live in Europe (Otis Redding album)|Otis Redding: Live in Europe]]'' was released three months later, featuring this and other live performances in London and [[Stockholm]], Sweden.<ref name="bio"/>  His decision to take his protege Conley (whom Redding and Walden had contracted directly to Atco/Atlantic Records rather than to Stax/Volt) on the tour, instead of more established Stax/Volt artists such as Rufus Thomas and [[William Bell (singer)|William Bell]], produced negative reactions.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=408–410}}{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=379–380}}

===Monterey Pop===
In 1967, Redding performed at the influential [[Monterey Pop Festival]] as the closing act on Saturday night, the second day of the festival. He was invited through the efforts of promoter [[Jerry Wexler]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/rock-history-101-otis-redding-at-the-monterey-pop-festival/|magazine=Consequence of Sound|access-date=November 15, 2011|title=Rock History 101: Otis Redding at the Monterey Pop Festival |date=October 3, 2010|author=Comaratta, Len}}</ref> Until that point, Redding was still performing mainly for black audiences.{{sfn|Echols|2000|p=164}}  At the time, he "had not been considered a commercially viable player in the mainstream white American market."{{sfn|Inglis|2006|p=34}} But after delivering one of the most electric performances of the night, and having been the act to most involve the audience, "his performance at Monterey Pop was therefore a natural progression from local to national acclaim,...the decisive turning-point in Otis Redding's career."{{sfn|Inglis|2006|p=34}} His act included his own song "Respect" and a version of [[the Rolling Stones]]' "[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction|Satisfaction]]."{{sfn|Inglis|2006|pp=34–37}} Redding and his backing band (Booker T. & the M.G.'s with the [[Mar-Keys]] [[horn section]]) opened with Cooke's "[[Shake (Sam Cooke song)|Shake]]", after which he delivered an impromptu speech, asking the audience if they were the "love crowd"{{sfn|Ribowsky|2015|pp=229–232}} and looking for a big [[call and response|response]]. The ballad "I've Been Loving You" followed. The last song was "Try a Little Tenderness", including an additional chorus. "I got to go, y'all, I don't wanna go", said Redding and left the stage of his last major concert.{{sfn|Inglis|2006|pp=28–38}} According to Booker T. Jones, "I think we did one of our best shows, Otis and the MG's. That we were included in that was also something of a phenomenon. That we were there? With those people? They were accepting us and that was one of the things that really moved Otis. He was happy to be included and it brought him a new audience. It was greatly expanded in Monterey."{{sfn|Brown|2001|p=2}} According to ''Sweet Soul Music'', musicians such as [[Brian Jones]] and [[Jimi Hendrix]] were captivated by his performance; [[Robert Christgau]] wrote in ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', "The Love Crowd screamed one's mind to the heavens."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=387}}

Before Monterey, Redding wanted to record with Conley, but Stax was against the idea.  The two moved from Memphis to Macon to continue writing. The result was "[[Sweet Soul Music]]" (based on Cooke's "Yeah Man"),{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=59}} which peaked at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=411–413}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/sweet-soul-music-mt0011903397|title=Sweet Soul Music|publisher=Rovi Corporation.

He was hospitalized in September 1967 at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Hospital]] in New York to undergo surgery.{{sfn|Jet|1967|p=55}}

==="Dock of the Bay"===
In early December 1967, Redding again recorded at Stax. One new song was "[[(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay]]", which was written with Cropper.{{sfn|Everitt|2004|p=53}} Redding was inspired by the Beatles album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' and tried to create a similar sound, against the label's wishes. His wife Zelma disliked its atypical melody. The Stax crew were also dissatisfied with the new sound; Stewart thought that it was not R&B, while bassist [[Donald "Duck" Dunn]] feared it would damage Stax's reputation. However, Redding wanted to expand his musical style and thought it was his best song, correctly believing it would top the charts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=388–391}} He whistled at the end, either forgetting Cropper's "fadeout rap" or paraphrasing it intentionally.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=132, 391}}

==Personal life and wealth==
Redding, who was {{convert|6|ft|1|in|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|220|lb|kg}}, was an athletic family man who loved [[American football|football]] and hunting.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=390}}{{sfn|Gulla|2007|p=397}} He was described as vigorous, trustworthy,{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=182}} full of fun{{sfn|Jet|1967|p=62}} and a successful businessman. He was active in philanthropic projects. His keen interest in black youth led to plans for a summer camp for disadvantaged children.{{sfn|Labrie|1968|p=40}}

=== Marriage and children ===
At age 18, Redding met 15-year-old Zelma Atwood at "The Teenage Party." Approximately one year later, she gave birth to their son Dexter in the summer of 1960 and married Redding in August 1961.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|pp=401–408}} In mid-1960, Otis moved to Los Angeles with his sister, Deborah, while Zelma and the children stayed in Macon, Georgia.<ref name=":1" />

Redding and his wife had four children: Dexter, Demetria, Karla, and Otis III.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|date=January 11, 1988|title=Otis Redding Remembered At Special Day In Macon| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YrsDAAAAMBAJ&q=how+many+children+otis+redding&pg=PA36|journal=Jet|volume= 73| issue =  15|pages=36}}</ref> Otis, Dexter, and cousin Mark Lockett later founded [[the Reddings]], a band managed by Zelma.{{sfn|Jet|1985|p=64}} She also maintained or worked at the janitorial service Maids Over Macon, several nightclubs, and booking agencies.{{sfn|Jet|1987|pp=17–18}}

=== Wealth ===
Redding's music made him wealthy. According to several advertisements, he had around 200 suits and 400 pairs of shoes, and he earned about $35,000 per week for his concerts.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=381}} He spent about $125,000 in the "Big O Ranch." As the owner of Otis Redding Enterprises, his performances, music publishing [[venture capital|ventures]] and [[royalties]] from record sales earned him more than a million dollars in 1967 alone.{{sfn|Jet|1967|p=58}} That year, one columnist said, "he sold more records than [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]] combined."{{sfn|Jet|1967|pp=61–62}} After the release of ''Otis Blue'', Redding became a "catalogue" artist, meaning his albums were not immediate blockbusters, but rather sold steadily over time.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=59}}

Shortly after Redding's death, Atlantic Records, distributor of the Stax/Volt releases, was purchased by [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] Stax was required to renegotiate its distribution deal and was surprised to learn that Atlantic actually owned the entire Stax/Volt catalog. Stax was unable to regain the rights to its recordings and severed its Atlantic relationship. Atlantic also held the rights to all unreleased Otis Redding masters.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=138–142}} It had enough material for three studio albums—''The Immortal Otis Redding'' (1968), ''Love Man'' (1969), and ''Tell the Truth'' (1970)—all issued on its [[Atco Records]] label.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=138–142}} A number of successful singles emerged from these LPs, among them "[[Amen (The Impressions song)|Amen]]" (1968), "[[Hard to Handle (song)|Hard to Handle]]" (1968), "I've Got Dreams to Remember" (1968), "Love Man" (1969), and "Look at That Girl" (1969).{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=138–142}} Singles were also lifted from two live Atlantic-issued Redding albums, ''[[In Person at the Whisky a Go Go]]'', recorded in 1966 and issued in 1968 on Atco, and ''Historic Performances Recorded At The Monterey International Pop Festival'', a [[Reprise Records]] release featuring some of the live performances at the festival by [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]] on side one and Redding on side two.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 26, 2008|title=the jimi hendrix encyclopedia - jimihendrix.com|url=http://jimihendrix.com/encyclopedia/document,19700826,3.html|access-date=November 13, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926154247/http://jimihendrix.com/encyclopedia/document,19700826,3.html|archive-date=September 26, 2008}}</ref>

Redding had at least two television appearances booked for 1968; one on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and the other on ''[[The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour]]''.

In September 2007, the first official DVD anthology of Redding's live performances was released by [[Concord Music Group]], then owners of the Stax catalog. ''Dreams to Remember: The Legacy of Otis Redding'' featured 16 full-length performances and 40 minutes of new interviews documenting his life and career.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-Remember-Legacy-Otis-Redding/dp/B000UCWK1U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1305321482&sr=8-1|title=Dreams To Remember: The Legacy of Otis Redding (2007)|access-date=April 13, 2011}}</ref> On May 18, 2010, Stax Records released a two-disc recording of three complete sets from his Whisky a Go Go date in April 1966.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/live-on-the-sunset-strip-r1778601|publisher=Allmusic.

Carla Thomas claimed that the pair had planned to record another duet album in December the same year, but Phil Walden denied this. Redding had proposed to record an album featuring cut and rearranged songs in different tempos; for example, ballads would be uptempo and vice versa.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=110–111}} Another suggestion was to record an album entirely consisting of [[country music|country]] standards.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|p=107}}

In 2011, [[Kanye West]] and [[Jay-Z]] released "[[Otis (song)|Otis]]" as a single off of their collaborative album, ''[[Watch the Throne]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title='Watch The Throne': Otis Redding's Daughter Talks 'Otis' Track|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/469122/watch-the-throne-otis-reddings-daughter-talks-otis-track|access-date=December 5, 2020|website=Billboard|language=en}}</ref> Redding was credited as a feature on the song. The song is produced by West who built it off of a sample of Redding's version of [[Try a Little Tenderness]].

==Musicianship==
===Style===
Early on Redding copied the rock and soul style of his role model [[Little Richard]]. He was also influenced by soul musicians such as Sam Cooke, whose live album ''[[Sam Cooke at the Copa]]'' was a strong influence,{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=182}} but later explored other popular genres. He studied the recordings of the Beatles and [[Bob Dylan]]. His song "[[Hard to Handle (song)|Hard to Handle]]" has elements of rock and roll and influences of [[Eric Clapton]] and Jimi Hendrix.{{sfn|Gulla|2007|p=412}} Most of his songs were categorized as [[Southern soul]]{{sfn|Gulla|2007|p=xxi}} and [[Memphis soul]].<ref name="Rollingbio">{{cite web| url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/otis-redding/biography|title=Otis Redding|access-date=February 16, 2012| publisher=Wenner Media|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

His hallmark was his raw voice and ability to convey strong emotion. Richie Unterberger of [[Allmusic]] noted his "hoarse, gritty vocals, brassy arrangements, an emotional way with both party tunes and aching ballads."<ref name="Allmusicbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/otis-redding-p5246/biography|publisher=Allmusic. Rovi Corporation|access-date=December 29, 2011|author=Unterberger, Richie|title=Allmusic – Otis Redding – Biography}}</ref> In the book ''Rock and Roll: An Introduction'', authors Michael Campbell and James Brody suggested that "Redding's singing calls to mind a fervent black preacher. Especially in up-tempo numbers, his singing is more than impassioned speech but less than singing with precise pitch."{{sfn|Campbell|Brody|2007|pp=189–191}} According to the book, "Redding finds a rough midpoint between impassioned oratory and conventional singing. His delivery overflows with emotion" in his song "I Can't Turn You Loose".{{sfn|Campbell|Brody|2007|pp=189–191}} Booker T. Jones described Redding's singing as energetic and emotional but said that his vocal range was limited, reaching neither low nor high notes.<ref name="100SingerStone"/> Peter Buckley, in ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', describes his "gruff voice, which combined Sam Cooke's phrasing with a brawnier delivery" and later suggested he "could testify like a hell-bent preacher, croon like a tender lover or get down and dirty with a bluesy yawp".{{sfn|Buckley|2003|p=858}}

Redding received advice from Rufus Thomas about his clumsy stage appearance. Jerry Wexler said Redding "didn't know how to ''move''", and stood still, moving only his upper body, although he acknowledged that Redding was well received by audiences for his strong message.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|pp=176–177}} Guralnick described Redding's painful vulnerability in ''Sweet Soul Music'', as an attractive one for the audience, but not for his friends and partners. His early shyness was well known.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=161}}

===Songwriting===
In his early career Redding mostly covered songs from popular artists, such as Richard, Cooke and [[Solomon Burke]]. Around the mid-1960s he began writing his own songs—always taking along his cheap red acoustic guitar—and sometimes asked for Stax members' opinion of his lyrics. He often worked on lyrics with other musicians, such as Simms, Rodgers, Huckaby, Phil Walden, and Cropper. During his recovery from his throat operation, Redding wrote about 30 songs in two weeks.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=390}} Redding was the sole copyright holder on all of his songs.{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=184}}

In "(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay" he abandoned familiar romantic themes for "sad, wistful introspections, amplified by unforgettable descending guitar riffs by Cropper".{{sfn|Unterberger|1999|p=224}} The website of the Songwriters Hall of Fame noted that the song "was a kind of brooding, dark voicing of despair, ('I've got nothin' to live for/Look like nothin's gonna come my way')" although "his music, in general, was exultant and joyful." According to journalist Ruth Robinson, author of the liner notes for the 1993 box set, "It is currently a revisionist theory to equate soul with the darker side of man's musical expression, blues. That fanner of the flame of 'Trouble's got a hold on me' music, might well be the father of the form if it is, the glorified exaltation found in church on any Sunday morning is its mother." The Songwriters Hall of Fame website adds that "glorified exaltation indeed was an apt description of Otis Redding's songwriting and singing style."<ref name="SHoF">{{cite web|url=http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C174|publisher=Songwriters Hall of Fame|title=Otis Redding|access-date=May 6, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218060432/http://songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C174|archive-date=December 18, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Booker T. Jones compared Redding with [[Leonard Bernstein]], stating, "He was the same type person. He was a leader. He'd just lead with his arms and his body and his fingers."{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=161}}

Redding favored short and simple lyrics; when asked whether he intended to cover Dylan's "Just Like a Woman", he responded that the lyrics contained "too much text".{{sfn|Guralnick|1999|p=182}} Furthermore, he stated in an interview,

{{blockquote|Basically, I like any music that remains simple and I feel this is the formula that makes "soul music" successful. When any music form becomes cluttered and/or complicated you lose the average listener's ear. There is nothing more beautiful than a simple blues tune. There is beauty in simplicity whether you are talking about architecture, art or music.{{sfn|Labrie|1968|p=40}}}}

Redding also authored his (sometimes difficult) recordings' horn arrangements, humming to show the players what he had in mind. The recording of "Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa-Fa (Sad Song)" captures his habit of humming with the horn section.{{sfn|Bowman|1997|pp=103–104}}

Along with soul and R&B, Redding's contributions to rock music have been noted by music scholars, particularly the "[[Psychedelic soul|black rock]]" performed by his contemporaries [[Wilson Pickett]] and [[Sly and the Family Stone]].<ref>{{cite book|pages=136, 139|last=Gatten|first=Jeffrey N.|year=1995|title=Rock Music Scholarship: An Interdisciplinary Bibliography|publisher=[[Greenwood Press]]|isbn=9780313294556}}</ref> "His musical palette, a cosmic alloy of gospel and blues, hammered into a gritty but elegant template by both black and white musicians, remodeled soul and rock and anchored the most infectious native music America had heard since the [[big band]]s", wrote biographer Mark Ribowsky.{{sfn|Ribowsky|2015|p=xvi}} Artists from many genres have named Redding as a musical influence.
