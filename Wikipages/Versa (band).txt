'''Versa''' (stylized as '''VERSA''') was an American rock duo formed in Port St. Lucie, Florida, in 2006, as '''VersaEmerge'''. The group consisted of [[Blake Harnage]] (guitar, vocals, and programming) and [[Sierra Kay]] (lead vocals).<ref name=tumblr>{{cite web|url=http://versaemergemusic.com/post/65479632789/in-the-summer-of-2012-we-filmed-a-music-video-for|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126211828/http://versaemergemusic.com/post/65479632789/in-the-summer-of-2012-we-filmed-a-music-video-for|url-status=usurped|archive-date=January 26, 2016|title=In the summer of 2012..|website=VersaEmergeMusic.com|date=October 29, 2013|access-date=November 2, 2013}}</ref> They had a revolving line-up, their most prolific being with bassist Devin Ingelido, who was a member from 2007 until 2011.<ref name=devin/>

Following self-releases, the band signed with record label [[Fueled by Ramen]] in late 2008 and released the ''[[VersaEmerge (EP)|VersaEmerge EP]]'' and their full-length debut ''[[Fixed at Zero]]'' (2010), which met with positive reviews from alternative critics.<ref name=releases>{{cite web|url=http://versaemergemusic.com/releases|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601182137/http://versaemergemusic.com/releases|url-status=usurped|archive-date=June 1, 2010|title=VersaEmerge Releases|website=VersaEmergeMusic.com|access-date=October 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=Fixed>{{cite web|url=http://versaemergemusic.com/post/725574438/fueledbyramen-versaemerges-debut-full-length|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803221908/http://versaemergemusic.com/post/725574438/fueledbyramen-versaemerges-debut-full-length|url-status=usurped|archive-date=August 3, 2010|title=Fixed at Zero out today!|website=VersaEmergeMusic.com|access-date=October 19, 2011}}</ref> The album didn't enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, but it ranked third on the [[Billboard Top Heatseekers]].<ref name=heatseekers>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200#/artist/versaemerge/chart-history/1019371|title=VersaEmerge|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref> After changing their name to Versa, the duo self-released the EP ''[[Neon (EP)|Neon]]'' on January 21, 2014.

Although the band was considered part of the [[emo pop]] scene and compared to other emo female-fronted bands, Versa's music style included [[experimental rock]], [[space rock]] and [[electronic rock]], as being influenced by artist [[Bj√∂rk]] and band [[Muse (band)|Muse]].<ref name=Bjork /><ref name=Muse />

In a 2015 podcast, Sierra Kay announced that she and Blake were working on a new project under a new moniker, leaving Versa behind to not create confusion.<ref name=podcast>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_qr6f48U5s|title=Pup Fresh Podcast Ep.

==History==
===2006-2009: Beginnings and early releases===
[[File:VersaEmerge at the Middle East Upstairs.jpg|thumb|left|Kusterbeck and Harnage performing with VersaEmerge, October 12, 2008]]
Florida band VersaEmerge was formed in 2006 by [[Blake Harnage]] (guitar, backing vocals), Anthony Martone (drums), Anthony Doan (backing vocals, programming and keys), Josh Center (rhythm guitar), and Nick Osborne (bass), after the departure of the vocalist of their previous band My Fair Verona.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=blogger&hl=en-US&passive=true&continue=https://draft.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL%3Dhttp://csrawinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/sierra-anthony-from-versaemerge.html%26zx%3Djk9lcaf65u3|title=Blogger|website=Accounts.google.com|access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref> Harnage chose the name "VersaEmerge" from the terms "[[List of Latin phrases: V#vice versa|vice versa]]", meaning opposite, and "emerge" meaning to rise up.<ref name="auto"/> The band recorded their first EP, ''[[Cities Built On Sand]]'', in 2007, with new vocalist Spencer Pearson.

With the departure of the four members, the band recruited Devin Ingelido from Bury the Ashes in bass.<ref>Bury the Ashes on Purevolume<purevolume.com/burytheashes></ref> [[Sierra Kusterbeck]] auditioned for the vocal position by sending a tape online. While the other members were not too sure about Kusterbeck, Harnage convinced them she was right for the job and she soon joined the band in 2007.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070315203407/http://www.fbrplus.com/] </ref> Little did they know that Kusterbeck lied about her age saying she was 18 years old, when she was really 16, so she could get an audition. However, Kusterbeck later cleared this misunderstanding and explained that it was more of a mix up; she was turning 17 a week from the audition, and she said to Harnage on the phone, "I'm 17, my birthday is in a week". This was misconstrued to mean she was already 17, and was turning 18, however she actually meant she would be 17 in a week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=blogger&hl=en-US&passive=true&continue=https://www.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL%3Dhttp://csrawinterviews.blogspot.com/2009/06/sierra-anthony-from-versaemerge.html%26zx%3Dilyrs6fk32sv|title=Blogger|website=Accounts.google.com|access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref>
After the recruit of Kusterbeck, VersaEmerge played local home shows and went on tour with bands such as Kiros, Our Last Night, There for Tomorrow, and Craig Owens.<ref name="auto"/> The band worked hard and released their first EP with Kusterbeck, ''[[Perceptions (EP)|Perceptions]]'', in May 2008. They then parted with rhythm guitarist James Lano, who was then replaced by Jerry Pierce. VersaEmerge later signed to [[Fueled by Ramen]]. They began to write their self-titled EP, recording with producer James Paul Wisner. The EP was released February 3, 2009. Rumors stirred of music videos for in Pursuing Design and The Authors, two songs on the EP. In late 2011, the video for in Pursuing Design was leaked.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20111107051724/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtMqc3hWpT8&gl=US&hl=en] </ref> A month after the leak, VersaEmerge still has not commented on its unplanned release.

After the release of the [[VersaEmerge (EP)|self-titled EP]], VersaEmerge went on "The Secret Valentine Tour" with headlining bands [[We the Kings]], [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]], [[The Cab]], and [[There for Tomorrow]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131231001535/http://wethekings.fangap.com/Home/tabid/29663/EntryId/10422/-The-Secret-Valentine-Tour-w-The-Cab-The-Maine-There-For-Tomorrow-VersaEmerge-Pre-Sale.aspx] </ref> After the Secret Valentine Tour, VersaEmerge grew a larger fan base and got picked to play 2 of 4 dates of the [[Give It a Name]] 2009 festival in the United Kingdom with bands such as Taking Back Sunday, Underoath, Thursday, Escape the Fate, and Innerpartysystem. They returned to the United States and almost immediately left for Bamboozle in New Jersey. When they returned to their homes in Florida, they began writing for their LP for a few months before leaving for Warped Tour '09. After The Warped Tour, they headed to Malibu to record and write for their LP, then packed up for the OP tour featuring headliner [[Boys Like Girls]], and co-headliners [[Cobra Starship]], The Maine, and [[A Rocket to the Moon]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theywillrockyou.com/2009/08/boys-girls-announce-love-drunk-tour-cobra-starship-maine/|title=Boys Like Girls Announce Love Drunk Tour With Cobra Starship The Maine & More|date=17 August 2009|website=TheyWilllRockYou.com |access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref>

On September 19, 2009, drummer and co-founding member, Anthony Martone, announced his split with the band through his Twitter saying "I'm no longer in VersaEmerge. Thanks for all your support. I am currently a drummer for hire, thanks everyone..." After about a week of fan speculation in regards to Martone's sudden departure, bassist Devin Ingelido and the band posted blogs about their parting with Martone, stating the split was due to personal reasons that will not be elaborated on. The band hired musician and friend Spencer Peterson (not to be confused with the band's former vocalist, Spencer Pearson) to fill in as a temporary replacement on drums for the OP tour. On November 22, 2009, guitarist Jerry Pierce announced on Twitter that he will be leaving the band due to personal reasons concerning his family. He cleared up that he remains friends with the other members, however he "just can't keep touring as much as [VersaEmerge] does." Jerry played his last show with the band on November 28, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://twitter.com/JerryPierceVE|title=Jerry Pierce (JerryPierceVE) on Twitter|date=12 August 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812025512/http://twitter.com/JerryPierceVE|access-date=4 October 2020|archive-date=2009-08-12}}</ref> They released their debut album right before the 2010 Vans Warped Tour. Pierce was not a part of the recording process.

===2010-2011: ''Fixed at Zero''===
[[File:VersaEmerge Vultures Unite Tour.jpg|thumb|Kusterbeck performing with VersaEmerge at the Vultures United Tour, October 2010]]
In March 2010, VersaEmerge was named one of American music website Shred News' "10 Artists to Watch in 2010".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20190915100733/https://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=shrednews&e=com] </ref> At the SXSW Purevolume house, VersaEmerge played four new songs; "Fixed at Zero," "Mind Reader," "Figure it Out", and "You'll Never Know", all from the upcoming album. Sierra Kusterbeck was also featured in the "Front and Center: The New Class of 2010" article of the May issue of Alternative Press. According to a couple of tweets,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/foreverakilljoy/status/12307480124|archive-url=https://archive.today/20131120182601/https://twitter.com/foreverakilljoy/status/12307480124|archive-date=20 November 2013|url-status=dead|title=@chrispcream HELLO! i'm glad you're drumming for Versa! you seem like a cool guy, hopefully you'll get to stay:D|first=‚ú® üéÑredeemed|last=kylo üéÑ ‚ú®|date=April 16, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/chrispcream/status/12307605714|title=@djsarXD thanks duder, I appreciate the kind words.|first=Chris|last=P|website=Twitter.com|date=April 16, 2010}}</ref> Chris Pollock, formerly of Maryland-based band [[Oh, The Story!]] is currently filling in as the drummer for the band. It has not been announced whether this is permanent or temporary.

The band was featured on the compilation album ''[[Punk Goes Classic Rock]]'' with a cover of [[The Rolling Stones]]' "[[Paint it Black]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://versaemergemusic.com/post/519545702/this-get-an-a-for-creativity-and-mentioning-us|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130310195101/http://versaemergemusic.com/post/519545702/this-get-an-a-for-creativity-and-mentioning-us|url-status=usurped|archive-date=March 10, 2013|title=Punk Goes Classic Rock comes out on april 27th|website=VersaEmergeMusic.com|access-date=October 19, 2011}}</ref> On April 26, 2010, the band posted that the name of their debut album would be called ''[[Fixed at Zero]]''. A clip of "Fixed at Zero" was also posted on the website www.fixedatzero.com. On April 28, 2010, fixedatzero.com posted the album cover, and pre-order information, with a release date of June 22, 2010, for the album. VersaEmerge went out to support the release of the album by playing [[The Bamboozle#May 1 lineup 2|The Bamboozle]] on May 1, 2010, playing alongside such bands as label-mates [[Paramore]] as well as [[Weezer]]. They also co-headlined a tour with [[I See Stars]] in the mid spring.

VersaEmerge completed their second full run on the [[Vans Warped Tour]] that began June 25, 2010, in California. They played the [[Glamour Kills]] Stage the entire tour. Kusterbeck also played a game called ''Where the Fuck is Sierra?'' with fans on every date of the tour. The game was similar to hide and seek and the first ten fans to find her received a winning card which was also a cut the line pass for their signing. On July 27, 2010, the band released the music video for the title track and first single from ''[[Fixed at Zero]]'' on their Myspace page. It was later made available on YouTube. On September 13, 2010, VersaEmerge announced that they would be headlining a tour in Fall '10 called the Vultures Unite Tour. They were joined by [[Anarbor]], [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]] and [[Conditions (band)|Conditions]]. The tour hit small venues across the US and also had two Canadian dates. It was claimed to be a "cinematic experience". [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]] left the tour due to an altercation between Ingelido and members of [[The Dangerous Summer (band)|The Dangerous Summer]], as well as previous issues disclosed on Kusterbeck's Tumblr page.

The band appeared on the MTV documentary show ''[[World of Jenks]]'' on October 18, 2010. After the episode aired, VersaEmerge's fan base had grown substantially. On December 10, 2010, [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] announced that VersaEmerge would be one of five bands on the 2011 Spring [[Alternative Press Tour]]. Joined by VersaEmerge are [[Black Veil Brides]], [[Conditions (band)|Conditions]], [[Destroy Rebuild Until God Shows|D.R.U.G.S.]] and [[I See Stars]]. In December 2010, former drummer Anthony Martone posted a personal account explaining his departure from the band, revealing that his tendencies to butt heads with Kusterbeck prompted his dismissal. On April 26, 2011, band member Devin Ingelido announced he was leaving the band to spend more time with his wife and newborn son.<ref name=devin>{{Cite web|url=http://www.upvenue.com/article/1351-versaemerge-announce-departure-of-bassist.html|title=VersaEmerge Announce Departure of Bassist|website=Upvenue.com|access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref> His last show was on May 7, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://versaemergemusic.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026142435/http://versaemergemusic.com/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=October 26, 2009|title=usurped title|website=Versaemergemusic.com|access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref> Nick Osborne (2005‚Äì2006) will be replacing him on bass for the UK/Euro Invasion tour.

On August 23, 2011 they released ''[[Live Acoustic (VersaEmerge EP)|Live Acoustic]]''. VersaEmerge was the opening act at the [[Fueled By Ramen]] 15th Anniversary show on September 9, 2011. It was also their last scheduled show for the year 2011. On November 29, the band streamed their cover of "[[Santa Baby]]" on [[YouTube]]. It would be made available on [[iTunes]] on December 20.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9badWVvVtiU|title=VersaEmerge: Santa Baby (Cover)|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The music video for the song premiered on PureVolume on December 6, 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.purevolume.com/|title=Pure Volume|website=Purevolume.com|access-date=4 October 2020}}</ref> The band performed at the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]] from February 25, 2012 - March 5, 2012.

The video of "Bones" was released on YouTube December 20.

In July 2013, the band was released from their record label, [[Fueled By Ramen]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fueledbyramen.com/|title=Fueled By Ramen Artists|website=Fueledbyramen.com}}</ref> On October 29, 2013, the band posted on their [[Tumblr]] the video for their song "No Consequences", and said that the song was to be the band's last release under the name VersaEmerge.<ref name=tumblr /> They also stated that new music was to be released before the end of 2013 under the band's new name, Versa.<ref name=tumblr/>

In November 2013, Versa announced that a new EP entitled ''[[Neon (EP)|Neon]]'' would be released on January 21, 2014.<ref name=Neon>{{cite web|url=http://versaofficial.tumblr.com/post/67400039074/our-1st-official-release|title=Our 1st official release|website=Versaofficial.tumblr.com|date=November 18, 2013|access-date=November 24, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203014515/http://versaofficial.tumblr.com/post/67400039074/our-1st-official-release|archive-date=December 3, 2013|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The three-song EP includes otherwise unreleased songs from ''Another Atmosphere''. The first single as Versa, "Neon," was released on November 22, 2013.

In June 2015, Sierra confirmed that the duo were ready to begin working on a new release following ''Neon'' in a new studio that Blake would be building in Brooklyn, New York, but that they would go under a new moniker and completely abolish the name VERSA. In the same interview, she also confirmed the band had created a second full-length album titled ''Another Atmosphere'' whilst they were under the name of VersaEmerge, but that their label at the time, [[Fueled By Ramen]], never signed it off and it is unlikely they will ever release it.<ref name=podcast />
