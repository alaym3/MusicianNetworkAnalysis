===Rise to fame===
After contributing to the 1992 compilation The Hill That's Real, M.O.P. debuted in 1993 with the single "How About Some Hardcore?", which appeared on the [[film soundtrack|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[House Party 3]]''.<ref name="Shapiro">[[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Shapiro, Peter]] (2005) "M.O.P." in ''The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop, 2nd edn.'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-263-8}}, p.259-261</ref> The underground success of the single, promoted by a low-budget video from then-unknown director [[Hype Williams]], led to their debut album ''[[To the Death (M.O.P. album)|To the Death]]''.<ref name="MOP"/> It was released in 1994 on the small label [[Select Records]], almost fully produced by DR Period.

In 1996, M.O.P. released their second effort, ''[[Firing Squad (album)|Firing Squad]]''.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=208}}</ref> Hoping for better promotion, they signed with [[Relativity Records]]. Changing record labels and production duties to include [[Gang Starr]]'s [[DJ Premier]] and Lil' Fame himself, the group still kept their energetic style, and gained a slightly larger following this time round. In 1998 M.O.P. released the [[Handle Ur Bizness EP|''Handle Ur Bizness'']] [[Extended play|EP]], which was soon followed by the album ''[[First Family 4 Life]]''. Working with the same formula, again with a heavy percentage of the record produced by DJ Premier and Lil' Fame, the album featured guest appearances by [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] of Gang Starr, [[Treach]] of [[Naughty by Nature]], [[O.C. (rapper)|OC]] of [[Diggin' in the Crates Crew]] and [[Jay-Z]]. The album had the dubious distinction of being the most stolen album from New York City's [[HMV]] stores in 1998.<ref name="Shapiro" />

M.O.P.'s fan base was loyal but remained rather small until 2000, when they released ''[[Warriorz]]'', this time on [[Loud Records]]. Mainstream radio began playing the first single, "Ante Up", produced by DR Period, with whom they had not worked with since their debut. The single was a hit and propelled the album to #25 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r493905/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|title=Warriorz > Charts & Awards > Billboard Albums|website=[[allmusic]]}}</ref> The follow-up single, the self-produced "Cold As Ice" (which featured a sample from "[[Cold as Ice (Foreigner song)|Cold As Ice]]" by [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]]), also received radio airplay,<ref name="MOP"/> although several of the song's lyrics had to be censored for the radio version. It was used in the [[UK]] on a TV advert for Ice White [[toothpaste]]. Both "Ante Up" and "Cold as Ice" reached the top ten on the [[UK Singles Chart]] peaking at #7 and #4 respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/2486/m-o-p-/|title=M.O.P. - full Official Chart History - Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> In 2001, M.O.P. collaborated with Krumbsnatcha to make the song "W.O.L.V.E.S.", which appeared on the [[Training Day (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the film ''[[Training Day]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/Krumb-snatcha-wolves-lyrics |title=Krumb Snatcha â€“ W.O.L.V.E.S. Lyrics &#124; Genius Lyrics |website=Genius.com |access-date=2020-03-13}}</ref>

In 2001, a [[remix]] of "Ante Up" was released featuring [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Remy Ma]], and Teflon, which was also very well received.<ref name="MOP"/> That same year, they collaborated on a song titled "Life is Good" with the [[pop music|pop group]] [[LFO (group)|LFO]]. The song reached #40 on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'''s [[Hot Singles Sales]] chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=m.o.p.|chart=Hot Singles Sales}} |title=Hot Singles Sales: Life Is Good |magazine=[[Billboard.com]] |access-date=2008-11-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702064804/http://www.billboard.com/artist/276837/mop/chart?f=353 |archive-date=July 2, 2014 }}</ref> Both singles continued the Posse's long-awaited mainstream success.

In 2002, Loud Records folded, leaving the group stranded. In 2003, Loud's parent label Sony/Columbia issued a greatest hits album titled ''<nowiki>10 Years and Gunnin'</nowiki>''. M.O.P. later joined Jay-Z and [[Damon Dash]]'s [[Roc-A-Fella Records]].<ref name="MOP"/> Their first recording for the label was a guest appearance on Jay-Z's album ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift & the Curse]]''; they were set to release their album titled ''[[Ghetto Warfare]]'', but the eagerly anticipated album was shelved. Two other albums were recorded: one titled ''The Last Generation'', and the other titled ''Kill Nigga Die Slo Bluckka Bluckka Bloaoow Blood Sweat Tears and We Out''.<ref name="split"/> A Dash-produced track "It's That Simple" with [[Spice Girls|Spice Girl]] [[Victoria Beckham]] was created, and received a premiere on radio stations in July 2003. This generated mixed reviews and further criticism, with the feeling being that Beckham was far from convincing as an urban act.

During this waiting period, the group kept busy by releasing a slew of [[mixtapes]] and appearing on soundtracks to films such as ''[[Bad Boys II]]''. They also contributed two songs ("Ground Zero" and "Put it in the Air") to the popular game ''[[NFL Street 2]]'', and another ("Fire") to ''[[Fight Night 2004]]'' - another video game. They also contributed Ante Up to the third installment of the popular ''[[Midnight Club]]'' video game series. Also in 2004, M.O.P. joined the successful American [[rap rock]] band [[Linkin Park]] on the second stage of the [[Projekt Revolution]] Tour.<ref name="G4"/>

The group also released a mixtape called ''Marxmen Cinema'' (under the name The Marxmen), as well as a self-titled [[rap rock]] album (under the name Mash Out Posse) recorded as a collaboration with [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] group Shiner Massive.<ref name="Shapiro" /> In 2004, Damon Dash sold his share of Roc-A-Fella to new [[Def Jam]] president, Jay-Z, and kept M.O.P. on his new label, [[Dame Dash Music Group]]. The group was left feeling uncomfortable with the situation. They announced their departure from Roc-A-Fella and Dame Dash in May 2005.<ref name="split">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1501538/20050509/mop.jhtml|title=M.O.P. Split From Roc-A-Fella And Dame Dash|publisher=[[MTV.com]]|author=Crosley, Hillary|date=2005-05-09|access-date=2008-11-15}}</ref>

===2005â€“present===
In June 2005, M.O.P. officially announced their signing with [[50 Cent]]'s [[G-Unit Records]], around the same time as [[Queens]] rap duo [[Mobb Deep]].  The duo completed a song with 50 Cent which was featured on the [[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (soundtrack)|''Get Rich or Die Tryin''' soundtrack]] entitled "When Death Becomes You", and also contributed their rap vocals in a remix of "[[I'll Whip Ya Head Boy]]". Months after the signing, M.O.P. released a compilation album entitled ''[[M.O.P. Salutes the St. Marxmen]]'', consisting of several tracks recorded while the group was signed to Roc-A-Fella. In July 2006, M.O.P released the long-shelved ''Ghetto Warfare''.

In February 2008, M.O.P. left G-Unit Records, due to creative differences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2008/02/07/m_o_p_leave_g_unit_records|title=M.O.P.

The album featured production from [[DJ Premier]], [[Statik Selektah]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], and [[Jake One]], and guest appearances from [[Heltah Skeltah]], [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Beanie Sigel]], [[Styles P]] and [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wiseguyzent.com/wordpress/?p=586 |title=M.O.P.

On October 14, 2008, M.O.P. filed suit in a New York Federal Court against the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] and [[John Cena]]. The group claims that Cena and the WWE stole parts of their song "Ante Up" for Cena's theme song "The Time is Now". The theme song is also featured as the first track on Cena's album ''[[You Can't See Me]]''. M.O.P. is seeking the destruction of the song and asking for $150,000 in damages. The lawsuit has since been dropped, it is unknown if a settlement was reached outside of court.<ref name="document">{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/10/28/cena-rumbles-with-rappers-over-theme-music/|title=Cena Rumbles with Rappers Over Theme Music|publisher=[[TMZ.com]]|date=2008-10-28|access-date=2008-11-18}}</ref>

In June 2009, with extensive production from Lil' Fame (as Fizzy Womack) and a historic guest-list ([[Masta Ace]], [[Kool G Rap]], [[Sadat X]]), the [[RZA]]-executive produced "[[Wu-Tang Chamber Music]]" debuted in the Top 50 within its first week.  M.O.P. themselves appeared on the album cut "Ill Figures" alongside [[Raekwon]] and Kool G Rap.

Lil' Fame produced the 2011 [[Wu-Tang Clan]] compilation ''[[Legendary Weapons]]'' alongside [[Noah Rubin (music executive)|Noah Rubin]] and Andrew Kelley.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On October 24, 2011, M.O.P. released their first single, called "Get Yours", from their upcoming album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pMHaewQKL54 |title=M.O.P. & The Snowgoons "Get Yours" (Sparta In Stores November 22nd) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-03-16 |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref>  On November 22, 2011,  M.O.P released their collaborative album [[Sparta (album)|''Sparta'']] with the German production team [[Snowgoons]] on Babygrand Records.
