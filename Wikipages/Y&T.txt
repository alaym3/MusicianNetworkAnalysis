The band was originally co-managed by [[Walter Herbert (manager)|Herbie Herbert]] (who also managed [[Journey (band)|Journey]]) and Louis "Lou" Bramy. The band has sold over 4 million albums worldwide to date, output summarised as 18 albums, three greatest hits collections and a boxed set.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.yandtrocks.com/bio/|title=Y&T Biography|date=2021-05-05|publisher=YandTRocks.com|access-date=2021-05-05}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years (1972–1983)===
Leonard Haze, Bob Gardner, and Wayne Stitzer had an unnamed band in Oakland, California that [[Jam session|jammed]] only cover tunes. [[Dave Meniketti]] joined as guitar player in 1972. Soon after, the band received a call for their first gig, but they needed a name. According to Meniketti and Haze, Haze chose the name of the album that was playing on his turntable at that moment – ''[[Yesterday and Today]]'' – a studio album by [[the Beatles]]. The first lineup – which only played covers of songs by other artists – consisted of Haze on drums, Stitzer on piano, Gardner on bass, and Meniketti on lead vocals and lead guitar. After Stitzer quit the group, Gardner switched from bass to rhythm guitar and piano, and Phil Kennemore was brought in to play bass. In 1973, Gardner left the group and was replaced by Joey Alves in January 1974. It was this 1974 lineup change when the band began writing original material.<ref name="Rock Scene Magazine"/>

The band did shows with [[Journey (band)|Journey]] and other acts including [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and during a show as part of the latter's ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|Night at the Opera]]'' tour, Y&T were seen by the president of [[London Records]] (who had been invited), and were subsequently signed to the label. London released first two studio albums, [[Yesterday & Today (Y&T album)|self-titled debut]] and ''[[Struck Down]]'', in 1976 and 1978 respectively. While finishing their second album, London disclosed they would be getting rid of all their rock artists, and Meniketti has since commented that this essentially meant that Struck Down "would go nowhere."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srP8oSOPM2o&t=353s|title=Dave Meniketti tells the story about Y&T (from 2008)|publisher=Metal Express Radio|access-date=2021-05-10}}</ref> They band continued to tour extensively, building up to headliners while they opened for bands such as [[Wild Cherry (band)|Wild Cherry]], [[AC/DC]], and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].

As Meniketti has said in numerous radio, television, and magazine interviews over the past four decades, a new record deal ("which took forever" [to secure]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srP8oSOPM2o&t=353s|title=Dave Meniketti tells the story about Y&T (from 2008)|publisher=Metal Express Radio|access-date=2021-05-10}}</ref>) in 1980 with [[A&M Records]] prompted the band to shorten their name to simply Y&T, as influenced by their encores where fans would chant "Y&T, Y&T, Y&T."<ref name="80's Metal Recycle Bin">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwozgbdZz-Y&t=82s|title=Y&T Dave Meneketti "Straight Talkin' Mean Streak"|publisher=80's Metal Recycle Bin |access-date=2021-05-08}}</ref><ref name="Rock Scene Magazine"/>

The band's first two studio albums under A&M, ''[[Earthshaker (album)|Earthshaker]]'' (1981) and ''[[Black Tiger (album)|Black Tiger]]'' (1982), did not gain mainstream exposure. Songs off these two albums still make up a significant part of the band's live shows. ''Black Tiger'' was recorded at Ridge Farm, in Dorking, County of Surrey, England and produced by Max Norman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srP8oSOPM2o&t=353s|title=Dave Meniketti tells the story about Y&T (from 2008)|publisher=Metal Express Radio|access-date=2021-05-10}}</ref> The classic Y&T logo made its first appearance on the cover of this album. Part-way through recording ''Black Tiger'', the band did their first shows outside the US; [[Netherlands]] followed by the UK.

By 1983, in spite of their lack of notable success, Y&T were starting to play at larger venues such as arenas, stadiums and amphitheaters across America and Europe, with a variety of acts including [[AC/DC]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Blackfoot (band)|Blackfoot]], [[Dio (band)|Dio]], [[Iron Maiden]], [[Marillion]], [[Mötley Crüe]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Twisted Sister]] and [[ZZ Top]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/y-t--2?page=3#concert-table|title=Y & T's Concert History|publisher=Concert Archives|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref><ref name="concertarchives">{{cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/y-t--3?page=2#concert-table|title=Y&T's Concert History|publisher=Concert Archives|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref> garnering far more mainstream recognition in Europe and Japan than they did in their native America.<ref name="80's Metal Recycle Bin"/> With their third A&M release, ''[[Mean Streak (album)|Mean Streak]]'' (1983), radio airplay and exposure had increased in the US despite poor promotion from the record company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srP8oSOPM2o&t=353s|title=Dave Meniketti tells the story about Y&T (from 2008)|publisher=Metal Express Radio|access-date=2021-05-10}}</ref>

===Commercial success and hiatus (1984–1991)===
Y&T's sixth studio album, ''[[In Rock We Trust]]'', released in 1984, became the band's highest-charting and selling album, reaching No. 46 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album produced Y&T's first big radio hit "Don't Stop Runnin'". [[Dr Pepper]] acquired the rights to use "She's a Liar" in a radio ad campaign. To date, ''In Rock We Trust'' has sold over 450,000 copies. This album was the only Y&T album to chart in Canada, reaching No. 77 on the RPM chart. The label brought in writer Geoffrey Leib for the album, the first time an external writer had been used. The success of ''In Rock We Trust'', which saw the band continuing to perform at arenas and stadiums (including opening for [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]] on their tours for ''[[Grace Under Pressure (Rush album)|Grace Under Pressure]]'' and ''[[The Last in Line]]'' respectively, as well as playing with [[Whitesnake]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Ratt]], [[Dokken]] and [[Night Ranger]]),<ref name="concertarchives"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/y-t--2?page=2#concert-table|title=Y & T's Concert History|publisher=Concert Archives|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/tourdates.php|title=Rush Concert Tour Dates Listing|publisher=cygnus-x1.net|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dio.net/tour/the_last_in_line.html|title=The Last In Line tour dates|publisher=The Ronnie James Dio Pages|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref> and participating in the 1984 edition of [[Monsters of Rock]] at [[Donington Park]] in England,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrockfestivals.com/donington-1984.html|title=Monsters Of Rock . Castle Donington 1984.|publisher=ukrockfestivals.com|access-date=May 21, 2021}}</ref> gave Y&T better exposure than they had before.

The band's 1985 hit "[[Summertime Girls]]", initially featured as the sole studio track on the band's first live album, ''[[Open Fire (Y&T album)|Open Fire]]'', and later also featured on their seventh (studio) album ''[[Down for the Count]]'' released later the same year, became the band's highest-charting hit to date, reaching No. 55 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 16 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock songs chart]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/yt/chart-history/hot-mainstream-rock-tracks |title=Mainstream Rock Songs}}</ref>  It received airplay worldwide, played frequently in the ''[[Baywatch]]'' television series, featured in several feature films (including Real Genius), received heavy rotation on [[MTV]] as well as MTV's top video playlists, and continues to get regular airplay today on [[classic rock]] radio stations throughout the United States. ''Down for the Count'' would be the band's last album for A&M, the band increasingly frustrated with the levels of promotion from the label within the US. Despite successful tours with [[Mötley Crüe]] and [[Aerosmith]] and the chart success of "Summertime Girls", the label declined to release a follow-up single. On his recollection of ''Down the for Count'', Meniketti said in an interview for Metal Express Radio: "...it ended up being a sort of wasted record... ...it was out right when a record company didn't care about us." The band still play tracks from the album in their live shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=srP8oSOPM2o&t=353s|title=Dave Meniketti tells the story about Y&T (from 2008)|publisher=Metal Express Radio|access-date=2021-05-11}}</ref>

In 1986, the band changed record labels to [[Geffen Records|Geffen]], and in that same year, Haze was fired for drug abuse issues (as Haze, band, and management discuss in the documentary "Y&T: On With the Show"), and was replaced by [[Jimmy DeGrasso]]; decades later when interviewed for the documentary ''Y&T: On With the Show'', Haze said, "I would've fired me too."

In 1987 the eighth album ''[[Contagious (Y&T album)|Contagious]]'' was released. In 1989, Alves was also fired for drug abuse and was replaced by Stef Burns. DeGrasso and Burns later played together with [[Alice Cooper]] in the 1990s. Y&T's next studio album ''[[Ten (Y&T album)|Ten]]'' was released in 1990. The album features ballads such as "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" (the first and only single from the album), "Ten Lovers", and "Come in from the Rain", together with a few straightforward hard rock songs, including "Hard Times", "City", "Surrender", and the fastest track Y&T ever recorded, "Goin' Off the Deep End". According to Meneketti, the video for "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark" was probably the best video they ever made, but with the onset of [[grunge]] he never once saw it on [[MTV]].<ref name="80's Metal Recycle Bin"/>

With the record company opting not to release any further singles from the Ten album, the band decided to do seven more shows in California and discontinue in 1991, concluding with the live album ''Yesterday & Today Live''. Shortly after the 1991 split Meneketti declined an opportunity to form a proposed 'super group' with [[Peter Frampton]].<ref name="80's Metal Recycle Bin"/>

===Reunion (1995–present)===
[[File:Phil Kennemore Hellfest.JPG|thumb|right|Phil Kennemore at [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] in [[France]], 2010.]]

In 1995, Y&T returned with the same lineup of Meniketti, Burns, Kennemore, and DeGrasso, releasing ''Musically Incorrect'' in 1995 and ''[[Endangered Species (Y&T album)|Endangered Species]]'' in 1997. The band performed sporadically during the mid to late 1990s. Y&T officially reunited in 2001 with virtually the same lineup, but with Haze returning on drums. At the time, Burns was in three bands: Y&T, [[Huey Lewis and the News]], and Italy's biggest rock star, [[Vasco Rossi]]; scheduling conflicts forced Burns to drop one of the three bands, and so in 2003, he left Y&T.  He was replaced by rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist John Nymann, who was a childhood friend of the band, and who previously toured on the In Rock We Trust tour as a background vocalist and Rock the Robot, and he sang backing vocals on ''Down for the Count''.

Y&T resumed touring the world in 2003. In 2006, Haze was asked to step down and was replaced by Mike Vanderhule on drums.

In 2009, Y&T inked a deal with the Italian label [[Frontiers Records]] for the release of the band's twelfth studio album, released in May 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=131830 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET&nbsp;– Y&T: New Studio Album Due In May |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2010-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=133296 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET&nbsp;– Y&T Continuing Work On New Album |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2010-12-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=136131 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET&nbsp;– DAVE MENIKETTI Says New Y&T Album 'Is Not Gonna Suck' |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2010-12-27}}</ref> Titled ''[[Facemelter]]'';<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=137857 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET&nbsp;– Y&T To Release 'Facemelter' In May |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2010-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606085730/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=137857 |archive-date=2011-06-06 }}</ref> it was their first proper studio album in thirteen years (since 1997's ''[[Endangered Species (Y&T album)|Endangered Species]]'').

[[File:Dave Meniketti.jpg|thumbnail|left|Dave Meniketti @ Download Festival 2010, Donington UK]]
In June 2010, Y&T toured the world in support of Facemelter, performing the big European summer festivals, such as [[Sweden Rock]], [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park]], UK, and [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] in Clisson, France. During this world tour, bassist Kennemore was diagnosed with stage IV lung cancer. Upon receiving doctor's orders to leave the tour and begin treatment, Kennemore urged Meniketti to find a replacement and continue touring.

In July 2010, Brad Lang, bass player from the band Jet Red, stepped in to play live for the band as they promoted 'Facemelter', as Kennemore wanted the tour to carry on during his fight with cancer. On January 7, 2011, bassist Kennemore died at the age of 57 after a short battle with lung cancer.  Kennemore and Meniketti had been the only constant members of the band since 1974.  After Kennemore's passing, Lang was asked to become an official member of the band.

On October 19, 2013, in Bellagio, Italy, Burns joined the band onstage for four songs (Black Tiger, Dirty Girl, Midnight In Tokyo, and Hurricane) in a reunion of sorts since Burns had been playing with [[Huey Lewis and the News]] and [[Vasco Rossi]]. This one-time reunion was very well received by the fans, as one would expect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/y-and-t/2013/lido-de-bellagio-bellagio-italy-63c77edb.html |title=Y & T Concert Setlist at Lido de Bellagio, Bellagio on October 19, 2013 |website=Setlist.fm |access-date=2016-09-15}}</ref>

In April 2016, Lang left the band to properly address his alcohol dependency; his last show with the band was on April 2, 2016, at the Fillmore in San Francisco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/yt-bassist-brad-lang-i-thought-that-i-was-a-social-drinker-i-am-not/ |title=Y&T Bassist Brad Lang: 'I Thought That I Was A Social Drinker.

On June 29, 2016, Y&T and Lang announced separately on their own Facebook feeds that they had mutually and amicably parted ways, confirming that Leigh would remain as the band's bassist.

In January 2018, Y&T released their first-ever acoustic EP titled ''Acoustic Classix Vol. 1''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/yt-to-release-first-acoustic-ep-in-january/|title=Y&T To Release First Acoustic EP In January|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref> In June 2018, Meinketti said that the band might release more acoustic EPs in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/dave-meniketti-says-yt-absolutely-plans-on-releasing-more-acoustic-eps/|title=DAVE MENIKETTI Says Y&T 'Absolutely' Plans On Releasing More Acoustic EPs|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

Y&T was among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>

On November 26, 2019, the long-awaited, fan-backed (on Kickstarter) documentary ''[https://www.yandtrocks.com/discograpny/yt-on-with-the-show-documentary-2019/ Y&T: On With the Show]'' was released.

===Legacy===
"Summertime Girls" has been the band's most widely recognized song, along with fan favorites such as "Mean Streak", "Contagious", "Rescue Me", "Forever".

Music videos for songs such as "Summertime Girls", "Mean Streak", "Lipstick & Leather", "Don't Stop Runnin'", "Don't Be Afraid of the Dark", and "Contagious" are still featured on [[VH1 Classic]].

Y&T's 2010 music video for "I'm Coming Home" marks the band's most-viewed video on YouTube with over 1.7 million views.

In the movie ''[[Anvil! The Story of Anvil]]'', in the bonus feature interview [[Lars Ulrich]] of [[Metallica]] talks at length about seeing one of his favorite bands Y&T for the first time at a club in Hollywood in December 1980. Ulrich credits Y&T as the reason he decided to become a musician, saying: "That was the turning point for me wanting to play music. . . . You could tell that they loved what they were doing."<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2XxN0EnSiE8 "Anvil!: The Story of Anvil"]</ref>
