Regarded as one of the best Filipino rappers of all-time, his fast-flowing vocal style has made him one of the most successful [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] artists in the Philippines. He was described by fellow great Filipino rapper [[Francis Magalona]] as "a blacksmith of words and letters, and a true Filipino poet."<ref>{{cite news |first=Pepe |last=Diokno |title=Francis M, rapper, TV celeb, "Idol" judge, modern hero |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/super/view_article.php?article_id=68350 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=2007-05-28 |access-date=2008-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923004037/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/you/super/view_article.php?article_id=68350 |archive-date=2008-09-23 }}</ref>

He has collaborated on almost a dozen songs with other [[Original Pilipino Music|OPM]] artists; ''"Lando"'' with the late [[Francis M]], ''"[[Upuan]]"'' with Jaezelle, ''"Bagsakan"'' with [[Parokya ni Edgar]] , ''"Baon"'' with  [[Gab Chee Kee]]  of [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and Francis M, and ''"Sari-Saring Kwento"'' with Noel Cabangon and [[Champ Lui Pio]]. His songs mostly tackle social issues such as social injustices, [[poverty]] and [[patriotism]]. He began his musical career with the [[gangsta rap]] group [[Death Threat (hip hop group)|Death Threat]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.abs-cbn.com/entertainment/05/26/16/gloc-9-says-he-is-ready-to-retire|title=Gloc-9 says he is ready to retire|website=ABS-CBN News|access-date=2019-03-03}}</ref>

Gloc-9 is notably one of the few artists in the Philippine music scene who has won an award in every album he created.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Career==
===In Death Threat===
In his song [[Talumpati]], Gloc-9 states that he joined a drive-by show by [[Andrew E.]]. After the show, a member of the Filipino hip hop group [[Death Threat (hip hop group)|Death Threat]] came into him then gave a paper on which the contact number of the group's leader Beware (Ronald Salanga) was written. After a phone call with Beware, he joined the group in which he began to make a name for himself in the local underground hip hop scene. His stage name "Gloc-9" came into rising when Beware told him that he must have a rap name in order to become a rapper. A number of options were suggested: ''MAGNUM45'' and ''KALIBRE28'' were rejected outright, but he decided that [[Glock]] 9, minus the "k", sounded catchy.

Death Threat released several albums until one-day Beware had to leave the group and asked Gloc-9 to be the leader of the group together with Hi-Jakk (which Gloc-9 describes as a "rapper who does not know how to rap" in his song [[Talumpati]]). In 1997, Death Threat released their third album, "Kings of Da Undaground," but it only features Hi-Jakkk and Gloc-9. The album received 4x platinum certification despite having no mainstream promotion but the only word of mouth in the streets.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ssonictv.blogspot.com/2009/07/gloc-9-interview.html|title=Gloc-9 Interview|date=July 24, 2009}}</ref>

===As duo with Hi-Jakkk===
Within the same year, the duo of Gloc-9 and Hi-Jakkk started to release albums not carrying the name of Death Threat under [[Viva Records (Philippines)|Viva Records]]. These albums are ''Domination'' that was certified gold, ''Tha Revelation'' certified platinum and ''Domination II'' certified gold. In his release "Talumpati", Gloc-9 describes these albums as ones that have not been thought-out and of being full of boastfulness. After their third album together, Gloc-9 was kicked out of the group Death Threat by Beware without any clear reason. Later, Hi-Jakkk decided to leave the group and in 2021, he decided to join [[Andrew E.]]'s Dongalo Wreckords.

===Solo with Star Music===
While working as a duo, both Gloc-9 and Hi-Jakkk continued to submit their solo [[Demo (music)|demos]] until the year 2000, when Christian Martinez of [[Star Music]] finally discovered Gloc-9's talent after 3 months of searching, when an executive of [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] accidentally put on his demo from a recording found in a scrap box.

At first, Gloc-9 composed and sang his own songs for soundtracks of several [[Star Cinema]] films like ''Trip'' and ''Jologs''. In 2002, he also joined [[Himig Handog|Himig Handog Love Songs]], a song-writing competition operated by the ABS-CBN Corporation and Star Music with his song "Bakit?" (co-written with Mike Villegas).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://music.abs-cbn.com/himighandog/|title=Join Himig Handog 2019!|website=Himig Handog Songwriting Competition - ABS-CBN Music}}</ref> The song has been interpreted by him together with Cookie Chua, becoming one of the finalists in the competition but without winning the title as the grand prize went to "Kung Ako Na Lang Sana" written by Socrates Villanueva and interpreted by Bituin Escalante. In this song-writing competition, one of his competitors was Jimmy Antiporda with the song "Hindi Na Bale" performed by Jessa Zaragoza. The latter was mentioned in Gloc-9's song "[[Talumpati|Gusto Ko]]".

In 2003, Gloc-9 released his debut album under Star Music entitled ''[[G9 (album)|G9]]''. Included in this album are songs that had been used in several Star Cinema films before. His second album, ''[[Ako Si...]]'' was released in 2005 under Star Music.

In February 2021, Gloc-9 announced a new album titled ''Poot at Pag-ibig'', which he would be releasing on YouTube one track a day from February 14–19.<ref name="Poot at Pag-ibig">{{Cite news |last=Arias, Jacqueline |date=February 16, 2021 |title=Gloc-9 releasing love-themed album ''Poot at Pag-ibig'' song by song |work=NME |url=https://www.nme.com/en_asia/news/music/gloc-9-releasing-love-themed-album-poot-at-pag-ibig-song-by-song-2880458 |access-date=February 16, 2021}}</ref>
