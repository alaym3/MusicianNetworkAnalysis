'''Vision Divine''' is an Italian [[Power metal|power]]/[[Progressive metal|progressive metal]] band formed in 1998.

==History==
Originally a solo project from [[Olaf Thörsen]] (born Carlo Andrea Magnani). Soon, [[Fabio Lione]] rejoined him after the first [[Labyrinth (band)|Labyrinth]] period ("No Limits"), and then what was supposed to be a solo project quickly turns into a band, taking its new name from Labyrinth's previous name ("Vision") and from the title that was supposed to be given to Olaf's first solo album ("Divine"). Completing the line up Mat Stancioiu (drums), Andrew McPauls (keyboards) and Andrea "Tower" Torricini (bass).

In its first three years the band released two albums, and  started touring (South American Tour in December 2000), where for the first time an Italian [[Heavy Metal music|heavy metal]] band got the chance to play (and sold-out) in countries like [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Panama]] and [[Mexico]].

In 2001, the band started writing and recording the new album, titled "Send Me An Angel", that was released in January 2002. At the end of the same year, Olaf decided to leave Labyrinth, to focus just on Vision and also deciding to stop any rumours from some magazine, pretending to consider Vision as nothing but a "side project". For the same reason Andrew and Mat split from the band and were replaced by Oleg Smirnoff at keyboards (ex [[Eldritch (band)|Eldritch]]) and Matteo Amoroso at drums (ex [[Athena]]). In 2003 the band started the songwriting for the third album, when Fabio started having some problem regarding the co-existence of his career and Vision Divine related duties. After a few months, they mutually agreed to split. They then proceeded to add new singer Michele Luppi, a vocalist with a previous experience in live performances. With this new line-up they completed the final songs for the album that was to be titled "[[Stream of Consciousness (album)|Stream of Consciousness]]". The album was released in April 2004.

With a brand new line-up and with renewed ambitions the band canceled any previous deal, deciding to join [[Scarlet Records]] for the Italian territory, [[King Records (Japan)|King Records]] for the [[Japan]]ese territory and [[Metal Blade]] for the rest of the world. In 2005, the band released "[[The Perfect Machine]]", which was recorded at Goldenworks Mixing Suite studio and produced by [[Stratovarius]]' leader [[Timo Tolkki]].

In 2006, Andrea "Tower" Torricini left the band for not being able to guarantee full-time dedication to the band{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}, and Cristiano Bertocchi replaced him. By September, ''"The Perfect Machine"'', according to their website "was immediately described as one of the best Italian metal releases ever, becoming one of Scarlet's all time best-sellers". A new digipack was released containing four bonus tracks. Also, Riccardo "Ricky" Quaggliatto left the band due to personal problems, replaced by new drummer Alessandro Bissa.

In 2007 Vision Divine recorded their album, "The 25th Hour", along with [[Timo Tolkki]] and Alessandro Bissa in New Sin Studios. It was released on June 29, 2007.

In April 2008 Vision Divine announced Michele Luppi is no longer singing with Vision Divine, and in May 2008 [[Olaf Thörsen]] announced that Fabio Lione rejoined the band as a full-time vocalist.

Vision Divine released their sixth album, "9 Degrees West of the Moon",on January 23, 2009, the first with Lione on vocals after Michele Luppi's departure.

In 2012 Vision Divine signed with EarMusic/Edel Group Records and released their seventh studio album entitled "Destination Set to Nowhere" on September 14, 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=81378 |title=Vision Divine Signs With EarMusic/Edel, New LP "Destination Set to Nowhere" Set for Fall |publisher= Metalunderground.com |access-date=September 19, 2012}}</ref>

In 2016, the band announced drummer Alessandro Bissa decided to peacefully part ways and announced [[Mike Terrana]] as the new member.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/visiondivineofficial/posts/10156877615680254 |title=Ladies and gentleman....our new drummer! |publisher= Vision Divine Facebook page |access-date=July 17, 2016}}</ref>

On April 28, 2018, Fabio had announced his second departure from the band. In December 2018, the band hired formed Derdian singer Ivan Giannini as new lead vocalist. They released their first single called "Angel of Revenge" on 9 December 2018.
