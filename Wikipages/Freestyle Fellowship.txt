According to ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Freestyle Fellowship incorporates "jazz rhythms into its raps, which have the improvisational ebb and flow and the random explosiveness of a jazz solo."<ref name=latimes1993>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-29-ca-8220-story.html|title=Liberating Rap With Jazz Sound : Freestyle Fellowship Adds Riffs to Rhymes|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|first=Dennis|last=Hunt|date=June 29, 1993|access-date=May 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417084911/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-06-29-ca-8220-story.html|archive-date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> In a 1993 interview with ''Los Angeles Times'', the group's member Myka 9 said, "What we are is liberators, liberating rap from its R&B/funk structures--that 4/4 (time) prison."<ref name=latimes1993/>

The group has been described by ''[[LA Weekly]]'' as "the astral jazz-cracked geniuses of sherm-strafed South Central, rapping with caged bird cadences about sleeping on park benches, biblical books, and gangsta rap carpetbaggers."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/music/having-already-influenced-every-rapper-you-like-freestyle-fellowship-are-back-2403051|title=Having Already Influenced Every Rapper You Like, Freestyle Fellowship Are Back|work=[[LA Weekly]]|first=Jeff|last=Weiss|date=September 27, 2011|access-date=May 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405034948/https://www.laweekly.com/music/having-already-influenced-every-rapper-you-like-freestyle-fellowship-are-back-2403051|archive-date=April 5, 2015}}</ref>
