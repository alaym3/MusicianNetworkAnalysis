'''Acid Bath''' was an American [[sludge metal]] band from [[Houma, Louisiana]], active from 1991 to 1997. Acid Bath combined [[doom metal]] roots with influences from [[hardcore punk]], [[death metal]], [[gothic rock]], and [[blues]] to create the band's unique sound.<ref>"Modern hardcore music scene".

==Biography==
Acid Bath was an incarnation of two bands,<ref name= "Interviews"/> Dark Karnival which featured Audie Pitre, Sammy "Pierre" Duet, and Tommy Viator, and [[Dax Riggs#Golgotha|Golgotha]] which featured [[Dax Riggs]], Mike Sanchez, Jimmy Kyle, and Jerry "Boon" Businelli. Golgotha's bassists were in frequent rotation finally culminating with Chad Pierce, who would then be succeeded by Pitre during Acid Bath's formation. Tommy Viator was later replaced by Jimmy Kyle on drums but would return to play keyboards toward the end of the band's career. Joseph J. Fontenot was the bassist for a short period of time.

Acid Bath formed in 1991.<ref name= "Interviews"/> The band was based south of [[New Orleans]] in several small towns including [[Houma, Louisiana|Houma]], [[Thibodaux, Louisiana|Thibodaux]], [[Morgan City, Louisiana|Morgan City]] and [[Galliano, Louisiana|Galliano]].<ref name= "Interviews"/> Influenced by [[thrash metal]] as well as bands and artists such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Celtic Frost]], [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] and [[Darkthrone]],<ref name= "Interviews"/> they recorded their demo ''Hymns of the Needle Freak'' with their manager and producer Keith Falgout in 1993. The strength of the demo earned them a deal with Rotten Records, an independent label. They released ''[[When the Kite String Pops]]'' produced by Spike Cassidy in 1994,<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=9}}</ref> followed two years later by their second and final effort ''[[Paegan Terrorism Tactics]]'' (also produced by Keith Falgout).<ref name="FanPage">[http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/lane/gd36/ant/abbio.html Acid Bath Setch's Unofficial Site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911113330/http://dialspace.dial.pipex.com/town/lane/gd36/ant/abbio.html |date=September 11, 2010 }}. DialSpace fan page.</ref> Neither gained them mainstream success, but both albums earned a high degree of underground acclaim. In 2005, another album composed of their demos, ''[[Demos: 1993–1996]]'', was released.

==Break-up and subsequent projects==
After two studio albums, Acid Bath's career came to an abrupt end on January 23, 1997, when bass guitarist [[Audie Pitre]] and his parents were killed by a drunk driver<ref name= "Interviews"/> who had run a stop sign. Kelly Pitre, Audie's brother, was the only one of four family members to survive the incident, escaping with only a broken rib and a mild neck fracture.

While rumors of another album circulated after the band's end, nothing new surfaced.<ref name="FanPage"/> Sammy Duet owns a tape of him and Mike Sanchez coming up with riffs for a possible third Acid Bath album. He mentioned this tape on his interview with ''Does It Doom?''. The tape was labeled "Rat Poison" because neither of them could come up with an album name. One of the members saw some rat poison in a box at the rehearsal space and said "just call it fucking Rat Poison".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSronzDiWUk|title=Sammy Duet: Acid Bath, Goatwhore, & The New Orleans Metal Sound|access-date=July 14, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> It was also rumored that some of the riffs were used for the first Goatwhore album; however, this was proven to be false.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Fljsdcp_qM|title=Acid Bath School Ep.1 : Any Acid Bath Riffs Used For Goatwhore?|access-date=July 14, 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

Tommy Viator played drums on [[Disincarnate]]'s album ''[[Dreams of the Carrion Kind]]'' with the well-known death metal guitarist [[James Murphy (guitarist)|James Murphy]]. [[Dax Riggs]] and Mike Sanchez went on to perform in the band [[Agents of Oblivion]], releasing one self-titled album in 2000 and disbanding shortly thereafter.<ref name="FanPage"/> Starting in 2000, Riggs was also the frontman for the [[swamp rock]] band [[Deadboy & the Elephantmen]],<ref name="FanPage"/> before he began releasing material under his own name in 2007. Sammy Pierre Duet was once a member of [[Crowbar (US band)|Crowbar]],<ref name="FanPage"/> but has since left the band. He is now a member of the [[blackened death metal]] band [[Goatwhore]] and Ritual Killer and his [[doom metal]] band with Kelly Pitre (the brother of Audie) Vual. Sammy Duet has remained an open [[satanist]] since his days in Acid Bath.<ref name= "Interviews"/> Audie formed a metal band in 1995, blending [[black metal]] vocals with the heavy sound of multiple bassists with no guitars, known as [[Audie Pitre|Shrüm]]. Tommy Viator and Joseph Fontenot were also members of Shrüm. Shrüm utilized two distorted low-end basses, and Fontenot would alternate between playing a distorted high-end bass and a clean bass. Fontenot later played bass for [[Devourment]] for two years. Joseph Fontenot is now a drill sergeant in the U.S. Army.

In 2014, rumors started that Acid Bath were reuniting with a new vocalist because, Jimmy Kyle reached out to vocalist of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Corey Taylor]], with a very vague message stating "Acid Bath is in search of a vocalist. Please send Mp3, demo, videos or any music links performing Acid Bath songs."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/acid-bath-reunite-attempt-recruit-corey-taylor-new-vocalist/ |title=Acid Bath Attempting to Tap Corey Taylor as New Vocalist? |date=June 5, 2014 |website=[[Loudwire]] |last=Hartmann |first=Graham}}</ref> However, these rumors were dismissed by other band members stating that "There is no ACID BATH without [late bassist] [[Audie Pitre]], so there will never be ‘new’ ACID BATH material." and that "Currently, most of the surviving members of ACID BATH — Jimmy, Mike, and myself — have been considering the possibility of doing some shows in the future, as an ACID BATH tribute band, but nothing has been set in stone, and it is still just an idea."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/acid-bath-shoot-down-reunion-new-music/ |title=Acid Bath Shoot Down Reunion Talk, Contemplate Tribute Tour |date=June 6, 2014 |website=[[Loudwire]] |last=Hartmann |first=Graham }}</ref>

==Musical style and legacy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2020}}
Acid Bath is best known for blending extreme, [[death metal]]-influenced [[sludge metal]] with a mixture of [[death growls]] and melancholic [[Gothic rock|goth]]/[[grunge]]-style vocals and acoustic guitar passages, as well as use of [[Sampling (music)|sampling]] and [[spoken word]] poetry. The band sampled sound clips from controversial movies including ''[[Blue Velvet (film)|Blue Velvet]]'' and ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]''. Dax Riggs' vocals were processed, which produced an [[Industrial music|industrial]] feel; some other instruments have been processed through industrial effects in their recordings (such as the snare drum on the second half of "New Death Sensation"). One of Acid Bath's most trademark sounds was the way in which they crafted multiple [[tempo]] changes and worked them into the song structure. Their experimentation drifted into diverse territory. The song "Scream of the Butterfly" is an acoustic [[blues]] song with the drummer with [[double bass drum]] patterns toward the end of the song. The song "The Bones of Baby Dolls" experiments with [[folk music|folk]] musicianship, and the song "Dead Girl" was described as a [[Country music|country]] song by Dax Riggs.

Dax Riggs' lyrics are frequently poetic, often displaying an obsession with death, drug use, mental illness, dark humor, Louisiana-based regional culture, and continuous references to [[animism]] as well as paganism, nihilism, and misanthropy. He has claimed these inspirations are culled from comic books, namely those authored by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], [[Alan Moore]], and [[Clive Barker]],<ref name= "Interviews"/> and has also expressed admiration for ''[[ANSWER Me!]]'' and ''[[Boiled Angel]]''. [[Allmusic]]'s William York has stated that the song "Venus Blue" could have been a radio hit "if not for the graphic lyrics".<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r261808|pure_url=yes}} "Paegan Terrorism Tactics > Overview"]. AllMusic.com.</ref> Another facet of their presentation which may not have endeared them to popular sentiment was the use of art by [[John Wayne Gacy]] and [[Dr. Jack Kevorkian]].<ref name= "Interviews"/> Due to the controversy surrounding Kevorkian's artwork ''For He Is Raised'' on the album, ''[[Paegan Terrorism Tactics]]'' was initially banned from Australia.<ref name= "radio 106.7">[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUJu8H7QWkA "Acid Bath radio interview on 106.7 The End"]. YouTube.com. User:thelostcollection (Dax Riggs).<!-- authorized video--></ref> The ban has since been lifted. The cover of the band's 1994 extended play simply entitled ''Edits'' featured the artwork of [[Richard Ramirez]].<ref name="Edits on Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives">{{cite web|title=Acid Bath Edits|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Acid_Bath/Edits/25134#album_tabs_notes|work=Acid Bath Discography|access-date=24 January 2012}}</ref> The cover of their 1996 compilation entitled ''Radio Edits'' featured the artwork of [[Kenneth Bianchi]].<ref name="Radio Edits on Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives">{{cite web|title=Acid Bath Radio Edits|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Acid_Bath/Radio_Edits/25133#album_tabs_notes|work=Acid Bath Discography|access-date=24 January 2012}}</ref> Their song "Diäb Soulé" ("Drunken Devil" in Cajun-French) starts out with an audio sample of [[Jim Jones]] of the People's Temple screaming. Their song "Toubabo Koomi" is Cajun-French for the "Land of White Cannibals".
