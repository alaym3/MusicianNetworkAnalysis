'''Agnostic Front''' <!-- Note: This article is written in U.S. English, which treats collective nouns as singular. (i.e. Agnostic Front IS a band.) -->is an American [[hardcore punk]] band from New York City.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Agnostic Front|work=Encyclopedia of Popular Music|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=9780199726363|editor-last=Larkin|editor-first=Colin|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195313734.001.0001}}</ref> Founded in 1980, the band is considered an important influence on the [[New York hardcore]] scene, as well as for pioneering the [[crossover thrash]] genre.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
===First era (1980–1992)===
Formed in 1980 with Vincent "Vinnie Stigma" Capuccio (formerly of the Eliminators) on lead guitar,<ref name="Blush2001">{{cite book|author=Steven Blush|author-link=Steven Blush|title=American Hardcore: A Tribal History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7AgdUYZ6U0wC&pg=PA215|year=2001|publisher=[[Feral House]]|isbn=978-0-922915-71-2|page=215|quote="The band AF started in early 1982 as The Zoo Crew at Apartment X, Crazy Emily's Eldridge Street storefront squat. ... they tried with James Kontra and Keith Burkhardt, before teaming with Roger Miret (ex-The Psychos/Distorted Youth), ... When people thought of New York, they automatically thought of Agnostic Front."}}</ref> with Diego on bass, Rob Krekus on drums and John Watson on vocals. Despite being billed at their first concert as the '''Zoo Crew''', Stigma introduced them as Agnostic Front, saying that the poster had been made prior to deciding on the name.<ref name="NYHC Live 13">{{cite AV media |people=Vinnie Stigma, Drew Stone |date=3 May 2020 |title= The NYHC Chronicles Live Episode 13 |medium= video |language= en}}</ref> They soon added [[Ray Barbieri]], aka Raybeez, on drums and Adam Mucci on bass.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=NYHC : New York Hardcore 1980-1990 |date=2015 |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=9781935950127 |page=154}}</ref> After Watson was arrested, the band hired James Kontra as their vocalist, who eventually quit before a performance at Great Gildersleeves after a disagreement with Capuccio about how to hand out stickers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=NYHC : New York Hardcore 1980-1990 |date=2015 |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=9781935950127 |page=155}}</ref> Although never having spoken to him before, Stigma told some of his friends to ask [[Roger Miret]] (former bass player of [[the Psychos]]) if he wanted to be the vocalist of Agnostic Front, because he liked his style of [[slam dancing]].<ref name="Blush2001"/><ref name="NYHC Live 13" /> In 1983, this lineup recorded their debut EP ''[[United Blood]]''. The EP was officially released later that year, however by that point Mucci had departed from the band, and been replaced by [[Todd Youth]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rettman |first1=Tony |title=NYHC : New York Hardcore 1980-1990 |date=2015 |location=Brooklyn, NY |isbn=9781935950127 |page=157}}</ref>

During its initial phase, the band consisted entirely of [[skinheads]]. Although this would change over time, Agnostic Front would continue to feature skinheads as part of their line-up. This led to a belief among some that the band espoused [[nationalism|ultra-nationalist]] or [[fascism|fascist]] politics, an assertion denied by vocalist Roger Miret in a 1985 ''Flipside'' interview:

<blockquote>
"...We're skinheads. And the skinheads in England have a very bad name like with the fascists and stuff like that. But this is America not England. Just because the skinheads are fascists over there doesn't mean we got to grow our hair out if we don't feel like it.... We love our country — but not necessarily how our government works.'<ref>Donny the Punk, "Agnostic Front," ''Flipside,'' whole no. 45 (March 1985), pg. 54.</ref></blockquote>

The follow-up, ''[[Victim in Pain]]'' (1984), is regarded as a seminal [[New York hardcore]] release. [[Dave Jones (drummer)|Dave Jones]] replaced Raybeez on drums, and Rob Kabula took over on bass. In 1984, Jimmy "The Kid" Colletti from Justified Violence joined on drums when the band went to tour with [[The Exploited]] later that year. The album pushed the band to the forefront of New York's fledgling hardcore scene, which was centered around [[CBGB]], where they played with bands like [[Cro-Mags]] and [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]]. Roger Miret asserts that all the songs on the album "are totally inspired by the streets of New York and my life and what was going on with my friends. It was dangerous. We did what we had to do to survive by any means necessary. It was like a war or a battlefield, and we stood our ground".

1986's ''[[Cause for Alarm (album)|Cause for Alarm]]'' was a difficult album to record, due to constant line-up changes and personnel problems.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=19}}</ref> Released on [[Combat Records]], it added [[thrash metal]] influences. With other bands such as [[Suicidal Tendencies]] and [[Stormtroopers of Death]], this album would mark AF's foray into the world of [[crossover thrash]]. It also featured some lyrics written by [[Peter Steele]] and drumming by Louie Beateaux (both of [[Carnivore (band)|Carnivore]]).

With yet another new line-up, the band soon released ''[[Liberty and Justice For...]]'' in 1987.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The album featured stripped down punk with a lack of thrash influences, yet it contained many metal-style guitar solos. It did not sell nearly as well as previous releases. Sometime later, Miret was arrested on drug charges after releasing a live album, and spent his time in prison writing new songs while Stigma and the band toured Europe for the first time. The lyrics written by Miret while incarcerated formed most of 1992's ''[[One Voice (Agnostic Front album)|One Voice]]'',<ref name="Larkin80"/> which featured members of [[Madball]] and [[Sick of It All]]. Not long after its release, the band decided to call it quits. Their last show was at CBGB on December 20, 1992, ''[[Last Warning]]'',<ref name="Larkin80"/> which was also released with ''United Blood'' EP on the end of the release.

===Second era (1996–present)===
[[file:-Agnostic Front live in Rome-2.jpg|thumb|The band performing in 2007]]
Stigma and Miret reformed Agnostic Front in May 1996 and did a few reunion shows in December 1996, signing to [[Epitaph Records]] and recruiting Jimmy Colletti on drums and Rob Kabula on bass,<ref name="Larkin80"/> who was playing with Against the Grain at the time. Their latest venture was titled ''[[Something's Gotta Give (Agnostic Front album)|Something's Gotta Give]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> In 1999, they followed up with ''[[Riot, Riot, Upstart]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> They also won an [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Award]] for the title track music video. Their comeback albums have sold well and been mostly acclaimed by music critics{{who|date=October 2019}} for their pure [[hardcore punk]] sound.

In 2001, they released the album ''[[Dead Yuppies]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> Songs from this album were rarely played live, as the band considered it more a product of Loved and Hated, Jimmy Colletti's side-project band.

In 2002, Miret worked on a side-project band, [[Roger Miret and the Disasters]], looking for a sound akin to old school [[punk rock]] and [[Oi!]]. Also that year, the band appeared in [[Matthew Barney|Matthew Barney's]] film ''[[Cremaster 3]]'' along with [[Murphy's Law (band)|Murphy's Law]].

Agnostic Front came out in 2004 with ''[[Another Voice]]''. The album was regarded mainly as a follow-up to ''One Voice''. The album, however, did receive some criticism from fans and the press for apparently changing their music to fit the current wave of '[[heavy hardcore|tough guy]]' bands. Musically, the album bears resemblance to bands that were heavily influenced by Agnostic Front, such as [[Hatebreed]]. Miret's vocals on the album particularly seemed to turn off many less hardcore punk-oriented fans. Later, the track "Peace" was contributed to the [[mashup (music)|mash-up]] album ''[[Threat (film)|Threat: Music That Inspired the Movie]]'', where it was remixed by Schizoid and renamed "World at War".

On March 7, 2006, Agnostic Front released the DVD ''Live at CBGB''. This follows the efforts of many bands that tried to save CBGB from shutting down. Miret claims that "We played more shows at CBGB than any band ever, and we played more benefit shows for CBGB than any band ever" when the club did close, most nostalgia focused on 1970s punk bands.

On November 6, 2007, Agnostic Front released the album ''[[Warriors (Agnostic Front album)|Warriors]]'' with the hit "For My Family" which was largely a continuation of the band's [[crossover thrash]] sound.

For the 25th anniversary of their debut LP ''[[Victim in Pain]]'', [[Bridge Nine Records]] released remastered versions of said album along with their first EP, ''United Blood'', on November 17, 2009.

The band performed on the Persistence Tour in Europe in the winter of 2009 and have were confirmed for Rebellion Festival 2012 in [[Blackpool]], England.

In 2015, the band released the album ''[[The American Dream Died]]'' via [[Nuclear Blast|Nuclear Blast Records]] which consisted mostly of the bands older style of music with a modern touch. The band continued to tour extensively in Europe as well as the U.S. in support of the record.

In 2017, Stigma and Miret appeared in a documentary about Agnostic Front, ''The Godfathers of Hardcore'', directed by [[Ian McFarland (musician)|Ian McFarland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thegodfathersofhardcore.com/|title=The Godfathers Of Hardcore|website=The Godfathers Of Hardcore}}</ref>
