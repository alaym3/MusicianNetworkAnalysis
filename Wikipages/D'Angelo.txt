He is associated with the [[neo soul]] movement, along with artists like [[Erykah Badu]], [[Lauryn Hill]], [[Maxwell (musician)|Maxwell]], and collaborator [[Angie Stone]].

The son of a [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] minister in Richmond, Virginia, D'Angelo taught himself piano as a child. At eighteen, he won the amateur talent competition at the [[Apollo Theater]] in [[Harlem]] three weeks in a row. After a brief affiliation with hip-hop group I.D.U., his first major success came in 1994 as the co-writer and co-producer of the song "U Will Know".

His debut solo album, ''[[Brown Sugar (D'Angelo album)|Brown Sugar]]'' (1995), received widespread acclaim and sold over two million copies. His next album, ''[[Voodoo (D'Angelo album)|Voodoo]]'' (2000), debuted at number one on the US ''Billboard'' 200. Its lead single "[[Untitled (How Does It Feel)]]", entered the R&B charts and won a [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]]; likewise, ''Voodoo'' won Best R&B Album.

Following this period, D'Angelo became increasingly uncomfortable with his growing status as a [[sex symbol]]. This was followed by numerous personal struggles including alcoholism, and a fourteen-year long musical hiatus. D'Angelo released his third studio album, ''[[Black Messiah (album)|Black Messiah]]'', in December 2014. The album was met with critical acclaim and fared well on music charts, peaking at number five on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The same year, D'Angelo was hailed as the next [[Marvin Gaye]] by [[GQ]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/story/dangelo-gq-june-2012-interview |title=Amen!
