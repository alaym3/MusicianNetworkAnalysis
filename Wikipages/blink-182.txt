'''Blink-182''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Poway, California]] in 1992. Their best-known lineup consisted of guitarist/vocalist [[Tom DeLonge]], bassist/vocalist [[Mark Hoppus]], and drummer [[Travis Barker]]. Though their sound has diversified throughout their career, their musical style blends catchy [[pop music|pop]] melodies with fast-paced [[punk rock]]. Their lyrics center on relationships, adolescent frustration, and maturity—or lack thereof. The group emerged from a suburban, [[Punk rock in California|Southern California skate-punk scene]] and gained notoriety for high-energy live shows and irreverent humor.

After years of independent recording and touring, including stints on the [[Warped Tour]], the group signed to [[Universal Music Group|UMG]]. Their biggest albums, ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999) and ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (2001), saw international success. Songs like "[[All the Small Things]]", "[[Dammit (Growing Up)|Dammit]]", "[[I Miss You (Blink-182 song)|I Miss You]]", and "[[What's My Age Again?]]" became [[hit single]]s and [[MTV]] staples. Later efforts, including [[Blink-182 (album)|an untitled album]] (2003), marked stylistic shifts. DeLonge quit the group twice, both times a decade apart; since 2015, the band has included musician [[Matt Skiba]], with whom they have continued to record and tour. Their most recent album, ''[[Nine (Blink-182 album)|Nine]]'', saw release in 2019.

Blink-182 is widely considered to be one of the most prominent and influential rock acts of the late twentieth century. Their straightforward approach and simple arrangements, which helped initiate [[pop-punk]]'s mainstream rise, made them popular among generations of listeners. Their fame and radio-friendly sound, however, led fans of punk-rock to [[selling out|question their authenticity]]. Worldwide, the group has sold fifty million albums,<ref>{{cite web|title=US: Blink-182 Top the US Charts|publisher=BMG Rights Management|date=July 11, 2016|url=http://www.bmg.com/us/news/blink-182-top-the-us-charts.html|access-date=January 5, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106010645/http://www.bmg.com/us/news/blink-182-top-the-us-charts.html|archive-date=January 6, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> and have moved thirteen million copies in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|title=Red Hot Chili Peppers, Blink-182, Staind: Alt-Rock Vets Return To the Charts|url=https://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1176999/red-hot-chili-peppers-blink-182-staind-alt-rock-vets-return-to-the-charts|author=Gary Trust|date=July 22, 2011|access-date=April 1, 2016|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406203729/http://www.billboard.com/biz/articles/news/1176999/red-hot-chili-peppers-blink-182-staind-alt-rock-vets-return-to-the-charts|archive-date=April 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and initial years (1992–1994)===
[[File:TwinPeaksPoway1.jpg|thumb|190px|left|View of [[Poway]]]]
Blink-182 was formed in [[Poway, California]], a [[suburb]] north of [[San Diego]], in August 1992. Guitarist [[Tom DeLonge]] was expelled from [[Poway High School|Poway High]] for being inebriated at a basketball game, and was forced to attend another school, [[Rancho Bernardo High School]], for one semester. There, he performed at a Battle of the Bands competition, where he was introduced to drummer [[Scott Raynor]].<ref name="lat95">{{cite news|last=Roos|first=John|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-21/entertainment/ca-16336_1_pop-music|title=OC LIVE : POP MUSIC : Punk Evolution: Blink-182 Adds Melody, Humor|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 21, 1995|access-date=May 25, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140526000530/http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-21/entertainment/ca-16336_1_pop-music|archive-date=May 26, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ut">{{cite news|title=With a wink to a sound that's fast, fun, Blink set to run for the tundra|author=Mikel Toombs|work=[[San Diego Union Tribune]]|date=March 30, 1995}}</ref> He also befriended Kerry Key, who was also interested in punk rock music. Key was dating Anne Hoppus, sister of bassist [[Mark Hoppus]], who had recently moved from [[Ridgecrest, California]] to work at a [[record store]] and attend college. Both Hoppus and DeLonge grew up listening to punk rock music, with both particularly enamored by [[the Descendents]].<ref name=totalguitar/><ref name="rb"/> [[Southern California]] had a large punk population in the early 1990s, aided by an active surfing, skating, and snowboarding scene.<ref name="p18shoo"/> In contrast to [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] punk music, the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] wave of groups typically introduced more melodic aspects to the group's music.<ref name="p18shoo"/> "New York is gloomy, dark and cold. It makes different music. The Californian [[middle-class]] suburbs have nothing to be that bummed about," said DeLonge.<ref name=p18shoo>Shooman, 2010. pp. 18–19</ref>

Anne introduced her brother to DeLonge on August 1, 1992.<ref name=p8-9>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 8–9</ref> The pair instantly connected and played for hours in DeLonge's garage, exchanging lyrics and co-writing songs—one of which became fan favorite "[[Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)|Carousel]]".<ref name="p8-9"/> Hoppus, hoping to impress DeLonge, fell from a lamppost in front of DeLonge's home and cracked his ankles, putting him in crutches for three weeks.<ref name=p10shoo>Shooman, 2010. pp.&nbsp;10–11</ref> The trio began to practice together in Raynor's bedroom, spending time writing music, seeing movies and punk concerts, and playing practical jokes.<ref name=p10-11>Hoppus, 2001. pp.&nbsp;10–11</ref> The trio first operated under a variety of names, including Duck Tape and Figure 8, until DeLonge rechristened the band "Blink".<ref name=p13shoo>Shooman, 2010. pp.&nbsp;13–14</ref> Hoppus' girlfriend of the time was annoyed by his constant attention to the band, and demanded he make a choice between the band and her, which resulted in Hoppus leaving the band not long after its formation.<ref name=p13-15>Hoppus, 2001. pp. 13–15</ref> Shortly thereafter, DeLonge and Raynor borrowed a [[Multitrack recording|four-track recorder]] from friend and collaborator Cam Jones and were preparing to record a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]], with Jones on bass.<ref name="p13shoo"/> Hoppus promptly broke up with his girlfriend and returned to the band.<ref name="p13-15"/> ''Flyswatter''—a combination of original songs and punk covers—was recorded in Raynor's bedroom in May 1993.<ref name=p16>Hoppus, 2001. p. 16</ref> 

The band began booking shows, and were on stage nearly every weekend, even at [[Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks|Elks Lodges]] and [[YMCA]] centers.<ref name="p21"/> DeLonge called clubs constantly in San Diego asking for a spot to play, as well as local high schools, convincing them that Blink was a "motivational band with a strong [[Just Say No|antidrug]] message" in hopes to play at an assembly or lunch.<ref name=p21>Hoppus, 2001. p. 21-23</ref> San Diego at this time was "hardly a hotbed of [musical] activity", according to journalist Joe Shooman, but the band's popularity grew as did punk rock concurrently in the mainstream.<ref name="p16"/> They quickly became part of a circuit that also included bands such as [[Ten Foot Pole]] and [[Unwritten Law]], and Blink soon found its way onto the bill as the opening band for acts performing at [[Soma San Diego|Soma]], a local all-ages venue.

The heart of the local independent music scene was [[Cargo Music|Cargo Records]], which offered to sign the band on a "trial basis," with help from O, guitarist for local punk band [[Fluf]], and Brahm Goodis, a friend of the band whose father was president of the label.<ref name=p29>Hoppus, 2001. p. 29</ref> Hoppus was the only member to sign the contract, as DeLonge was at work at the time and Raynor was still a [[Minor (law)|minor]].<ref name=p30>Hoppus, 2001. p. 30</ref> The band recorded their debut album—''[[Cheshire Cat (Blink-182 album)|Cheshire Cat]]'', released in February 1995—in three days at [[Westbeach Recorders]] in [[Los Angeles]], fueled by both new songs and re-recordings of songs from previous demos.<ref name=p31>Hoppus, 2001. p. 31</ref> "[[M+M's]]", the band's first single, garnered local radio airplay from [[XETRA-FM|91X]], and Cargo offered the band a small budget to film a music video for it.<ref name=p35-36>Hoppus, 2001. pp.&nbsp;35–36</ref> Meanwhile, the record also drew the attention of Irish band [[Blink (band)|Blink]]. Unwilling to engage in a legal battle, the band agreed to change their name.<ref name="p39"/> Cargo gave the band a week, but the trio put off the decision for more than two afterward. Eventually, Cargo called the trio, demanding that they "change the name or [we'll] change it for you," after which the band decided on a random number, 182.<ref name=name>{{Cite episode |title=Episode 4–4–11 |series=Hoppus on Music |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJMUzMrFP0 |network=Fuse |airdate=April 14, 2011 |season=2 |access-date=December 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160922171538/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPJMUzMrFP0 |archive-date=September 22, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="rstruth">{{cite web |last=Edwards |first=Gavin |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-half-naked-truth-about-blink-182-20000803 |title=Blink-182: The Half-Naked Truth |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=August 3, 2000 |access-date=July 18, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203033034/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-half-naked-truth-about-blink-182-20000803 |archive-date=February 3, 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The band soon hired a manager, Rick DeVoe, who had worked with larger bands such as [[NOFX]], [[Pennywise (band)|Pennywise]] and [[The Offspring]].<ref name=p39>Hoppus, 2001. p. 39</ref> In addition, the group drew the attention of Rick and Jean Bonde of the Tahoe booking agency, who were responsible for "spreading the name of the band far and wide."<ref name="p39"/><ref name=shooman32>Shooman, 2010. pp.&nbsp;32–33</ref> In late 1995, the trio embarked on their first national tour, promoting the surf video ''GoodTimes'' with Unwritten Law, [[Sprung Monkey]] and [[7 Seconds (band)|7 Seconds]]. ''GoodTimes'' was directed by filmmaker [[Taylor Steele (filmmaker)|Taylor Steele]], who was a friend of DeVoe. In preparation for the trek, the band members purchased their own tour van, which they nicknamed the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''.<ref name=p44>Hoppus, 2001. p. 44</ref> The ''GoodTimes'' tour extended outside the States with a leg in [[Australia]]; the trio were financially unable to go, but Pennywise's members paid for their plane tickets.<ref name=p52-53>Hoppus, 2001. pp.&nbsp;52–53</ref> [[Fletcher Dragge]], guitarist of Pennywise, believed in the band strongly. He demanded that [[Kevin Lyman]], founder of the traveling rock-based [[Warped Tour]], sign the band for its 1996 iteration, predicting they would become "gigantic."<ref name="onenineninefour">{{cite AV media | people=[[Jai Al-Attas|Al-Attas, Jai]] (Director) | year=2009 | title=[[One Nine Nine Four]] | medium=Motion picture | location=US| publisher=Robot Academy}}</ref> That year, the band toured heavily, with several domestic shows on and off the Warped Tour, trips to Canada and Japan, and more Australian dates. Australia were particularly receptive to the band and their humorous stage antics, which gained the band a reputation but also made them ostracized and considered a joke.<ref name="nyt"/><ref name="MTV influence"/>

By March 1996, the trio began to accumulate a genuine buzz among major labels, resulting in a bidding war between [[Interscope Records|Interscope]], [[MCA Records|MCA]] and [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]].<ref name=shooman37>Shooman, 2010. p. 37</ref> MCA promised the group complete artistic freedom and ultimately signed the band,<ref name=p64>Hoppus, 2001. p. 64</ref> but Raynor held a great affinity for Epitaph and began to feel half-invested in the band when they chose MCA.<ref name=shooman55>Shooman, 2010. p. 55</ref> The group, discouraged by Cargo's lack of distribution and faith in the group, held no qualms about signing to a major label but were fiercely criticized in the punk community.<ref name="shooman37"/><ref name=p44.1>Footman, 2002. p. 44</ref><ref name=p61>Hoppus, 2001. p. 61</ref> After nonstop touring, the trio began recording their follow-up LP, ''[[Dude Ranch (album)|Dude Ranch]]'', over the period of a month in late 1996 with producer [[Mark Trombino]].<ref name=p69>Hoppus, 2001. p. 69</ref> The record saw release the following June, and the band headed out on the 1997 Warped Tour.

{{blockquote|Punk rock was becoming polished. [[NOFX]] [was] a punk band we grew up listening to, and they had a record called ''[[Punk in Drublic]]'', and it was awesome.

Blink-182 was one of the most popular rock bands at the turn of the millennium, and spearheaded the second wave of pop punk and its journey into the mainstream.<ref name=rsency>Romanowski, Patricia.

Their seeming ordinariness convinced a generation of goofy punks that maybe they, too, could turn out deceptively simple songs as well constructed as anything on the pop chart.

Despite this, the band never received particularly glowing reviews, with many reviewers dismissing them as a joke. British publication ''[[NME]]'' was particularly critical of the trio, with reviewer Steven Wells begging them to "fuck right off," comparing them to "that sanitised, castrated, shrink-wrapped '[[New wave music|new wave]]' crap that the major US record companies pumped out circa 1981 in their belated attempt to jump on the 'punk' bandwagon."<ref name=nme>{{cite journal |last=Wells |first=Steven |date=June 18, 2001 |title=''Take Off Your Pants and Jacket'': Review |journal=[[NME]] |url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/5230 |publisher=[[IPC Media]] |location=[[London]] |issn=1049-0434 |access-date=February 14, 2013 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6EROZSEMd?url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/5230 |archive-date=February 15, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Nevertheless, subsequent reviews of the band's discography have been more positive.

In 2011, Jon Caramanica of ''The New York Times'' asserted that "no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182," stating that even as the band receded after their initial 2005 split, "its sound and style could be heard in the muscular pop punk of Fall Out Boy or in the current wave of high-gloss [[Warped Tour]] punk bands, like [[All Time Low]] and [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]]."<ref name="nyt"/> Montgomery concurs: "...without them, there'd be no [[Fall Out Boy]], no [[Paramore]], or no [[Fueled by Ramen|Fueled by Ramen Records]]."<ref name="MTV influence">{{cite web |title=How Did Blink-182 Become So Influential? |author=James Montgomery |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=February 9, 2009 |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604639/20090209/blink_182.jhtml |access-date=February 9, 2009 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AUBbmADV?url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604639/how-did-blink-182-become-so-influential.jhtml |archive-date=September 6, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Maria Sherman of ''[[The Village Voice]]'' took this a step further, writing "Apart from the sound, Blink's ideology has been popularized [...] their presence is everywhere."<ref name="VV">{{cite news|title=I Was in an All-Girl Blink-182 Cover Band Called Dumpweed|author=Maria Sherman|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|date=September 11, 2013|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/09/blink_182_most_important_90s_band.php|access-date=September 12, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913095543/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2013/09/blink_182_most_important_90s_band.php|archive-date=September 13, 2013}}</ref> "When it comes to having inestimable influence, Blink-182 might well be contemporary punk's version of [[the Beatles]]", wrote Scott Heisel in a 2009 ''[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' cover story on the band.<ref name="altpress09">{{cite magazine|title=Back Together for the Kids|author=Scott Heisel|pages=110–118|date=July 2009 |magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]}}</ref> The same magazine later ranked Blink the fourth of the "30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years," just behind [[Radiohead]], [[Fugazi]], and Nirvana.<ref name="altpress15">{{cite magazine|title=30 Most Influential Bands of the Past 30 Years|pages=87–89|date=May 2015|magazine=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]}}</ref> Bands such as [[Panic! at the Disco]] and All Time Low originated covering Blink-182 songs,<ref name="spin.2">{{cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2005/10/panic-disco/|title=Artist of the Day: Panic! at the Disco|author=Emily Zemler|date=October 3, 2005|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|access-date=March 20, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151002142426/http://www.spin.com/2005/10/panic-disco/|archive-date=October 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> while [[You Me at Six]], and [[5 Seconds of Summer]] have also named the band as influences.<ref name="KerrangAug14"/> "Anyone in our genre would be lying if they said they weren't influenced by Blink-182," said [[Joel Madden]] of [[Good Charlotte]].<ref name=Kerrang05>{{cite magazine| last =Browne | first =Nichola | date = November 20, 2005| title = Punk Rock!
