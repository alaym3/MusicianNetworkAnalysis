'''Psychedelic Porn Crumpets''' is an Australian [[psychedelic rock]] band formed in 2014 in [[Perth]]. Members include Jack McEwan (guitar and vocals), Luke Parish (guitar), Danny Caddy (drums), Luke Reynolds (bass), and Chris Young (keyboard), who began playing together in "an old horse barn in rural Leederville".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets Artist Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/psychedelic-porn-crumpets-mn0003766760/biography.|last=Monger|first=Timothy|date=|website=Allmusic|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Their genre and sound has been compared to that of other popular psychedelic rock bands in Australia, such as [[King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard|King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard]] and [[Tame Impala]]. They have self-described their sound as "an energetic mess of colour and tone".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets: On Doing It Yourself and Touring Europe|url=http://lunchboxtv.com.au/psychedelic-porn-crumpets-doing-it-yourself-and-touring-europe/|date=2018-10-02|website=LunchBox|language=en-AU|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> Concerning the reasoning behind the name of the band, its members have given little explanation. The band claims it was chosen at random because they thought it was amusing.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=5 minutes with Jack and Luke from Psychedelic Porn Crumpets.|url=http://pilerats.com/music/bands/5-minutes-with-jack-and-luke-from-psychedelic-porn-crumpets./|last=Lavell-Lee|first=Jackson|date=2016|website=PILERATS|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> The word [[crumpet]] may be unusual to some, as it is a traditional English food described in the ''Cambridge Dictionary'' as "a small, round type of bread with holes in one side that is eaten hot with butter".<ref>{{Cite web|title=CRUMPET {{!}} meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/crumpet|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

== Band history ==
The bandmates were friends prior to the creation of the band. It has been suggested that they became acquainted through their mutual drug dealer.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Toast of Perth: Psychedelic Porn Crumpets|url=https://diymag.com/2018/11/16/psychedelic-porn-crumpets-interview-neu-october-2018|last=Wright|first=Lisa|date=16 November 2018|website=DIY Magazine|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> The band began initially as a university project for a unit that Jack McEwan was taking at the time.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Rock Influenced By Experimental Electronic Jazz|url=https://themusic.com.au/features/psychedelic-porn-crumpets-coel-healy/uxusr67r0nm/16-03-16/|last=Healy|first=Coel|date=16 March 2016|website=The Music|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> They then continued to make music for their own enjoyment, as well as for that of their young local community in what has been described as “garage rave” type settings.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets|url=https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/psychedelic-porn-crumpets|last=|first=|date=September 2018|website=triple j Unearthed|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref> They have made a point of retaining a ‘DIY’ band mantra, recording most of their own songs, as well as aiming to be very hands-on in their own advertisement.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets: On Doing It Yourself and Touring Europe|url=http://lunchboxtv.com.au/psychedelic-porn-crumpets-doing-it-yourself-and-touring-europe/|last=Clarke|first=Tom|date=2018-10-02|website=LunchBox|language=en-AU|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>

The band went on in 2017 to create their own record label, What Reality? Records. They have made clear that they chose to do this for reasons of "getting stuck into existence, taking a risk, pursuing ideas, setting goals and trying to dream big."<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets announce their own label What Reality?

Records as "a support structure for upcoming bands".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets talk labels, drugs and touring — Sungenre Interview|url=https://sungenre.com/interview/psychedelic-porn-crumpets/|last=Webb|first=Dan|date=20 October 2018|website=Sungenre|language=en-AU|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref>

In 2018 came the release of their single, "Social Candy", which was overall well received and led to a brief national tour through October of the same year, passing through Melbourne, Adelaide, and Perth.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Psychedelic Porn Crumpets enjoy UK radio success, touring extensively with 'Social Candy'!|url=https://beehive-pr.com.au/2018/08/17/psychedelic-porn-crumpets-uk-radio-signing-social-candy-tour-dates/|date=17 August 2018|website=Beehive PR|language=en-US|access-date=25 May 2020}}</ref> This tour was when the band first introduced the back-up drummer Peter Coyne.<ref>https://www.triplejunearthed.com/artist/psychedelic-porn-crumpets</ref>
