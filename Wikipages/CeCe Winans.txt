==Duo with BeBe Winans==
Winans first went to Charlotte, North Carolina, in 1981 as a singer on the popular Christian telecast, ''[[The PTL Club]]'', hosted by Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker. Although originally part of the larger [[Winans family]] singing group, CeCe and her older brother BeBe became a duo during their time at PTL, in response to positive reactions to their version of the song "[[Up Where We Belong]]" sung as a duet, with lyrics changed for Christian audiences. In 1984, CeCe and Bebe released their first album, ''[[Lord Lift Us Up]]'', for PTL Records. They achieved crossover success, eventually releasing nine Gold and Platinum recordings, billed as [[BeBe & CeCe Winans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nmaam.org/2018/07/31/profile-bebe-cece-winans/ |title=Profile: BeBe & CeCe Winans |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=July 31, 2018 |website=[[National Museum of African American Music]] |access-date=October 29, 2020}}</ref> Winans left PTL in 1984 just before getting married. Her brother left in 1985. They released their second album in 1987: [[BeBe & CeCe Winans (album)|''BeBe & CeCe Winans'']].

==Solo career==
Winans began her solo career with the album ''Alone in His Presence'', released in 1995. It sold more than a million copies, and earned her a [[Grammy Award]] and two [[Dove Awards]], including the Female Vocalist of the Year. Winans's next release, the [[Music recording sales certification|Gold-certified]] ''Everlasting Love'', was released in 1998 and featured Winans' highest-charting solo singles: "Well Alright" and "Slippin". The song "On That Day" from the album was written and produced by [[R&B]] singer [[Lauryn Hill]]. Later that year, Winans released ''His Gift''; a holiday album.

In 1999, Winans started her own recording company, [[PureSprings Gospel]]. Her first album on the label was ''[[Alabaster Box (album)|Alabaster Box]]'' in 1999. Some production of the disc was done by Gospel singer and musician [[Fred Hammond]]. It included a guest appearance by [[Take 6]]. In 2000 Winans released a concert VHS titled ''Live at the Lambs Theater in New York''. The concert contained songs from her previous albums. Winans released her next album, the self-titled [[CeCe Winans (album)|''CeCe Winans'']], in 2001. The single "Anybody Wanna Pray" included a guest appearance by [[GRITS]]. The second single, "Say A Prayer" crossed over into the [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM]] market.

Winans took a two-year break from releasing albums and returned in 2003 with ''[[Throne Room (album)|Throne Room]]''. The first 1,000 copies were issued with a bonus CD that contained exclusive interviews with the artist, the making of the CD, some touring footage, and the music video "More Than What I Wanted" (which came from the 2001 release). In 2004, the 25-city tour ''Throne Room'' with the group [[Anointed]] featured free admission and was followed with a DVD release of the concert recorded in Tennessee. ''Live in the Throne Room'' contained tracks from all of Winans's albums. Around September 2004, Winans experienced what she thought was a flu but turned out to be a serious stomach infection and was hospitalized immediately for surgery. Due to the extended recovery time, the second half of the ''Throne Room Tour'' was postponed to early 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2005/cecewinans-1005.html |title= Purified by Fire|date= October 2005|author= LaTonya Taylor|access-date=August 25, 2007 |work= Christianity Today }}</ref>

Winans's seventh album ''[[Purified (album)|Purified]]'' was released in 2005. Her nephew [[Mario Winans]] was one of four producers. Her son Alvin III co-wrote several songs on the album, and her younger sisters Angie and Debbie performed.

Winans' collection of Top Ten R&B radio hits include "[[Count On Me (Whitney Houston and CeCe Winans song)|Count On Me]]", her duet with [[Whitney Houston]], from the ''[[Waiting to Exhale]]'' soundtrack. The single was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] in the US and reached No. 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], No. 4 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and No. 8 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard R&B Singles]] chart.

Winans released her eighth album, ''[[Thy Kingdom Come]]'' on April 1, 2008, featuring the single "Waging War". On October 6, 2009, a BeBe & CeCe reunion album named [[Still (BeBe & CeCe Winans album)|''Still'']] was released by Malaco Records, and features collaborations with Marvin Winans and contemporary gospel sister duo [[Mary Mary]].

On December 23, 2010, Winans along with Bebe and Mary Mary, featuring the [[West Angeles Church of God in Christ|West Angeles Choir]], performed on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fusemix.com/en/the-leak/1729-cece-winans-and-bebe-winans-on-the-tonight-show-with-jay-leno|title=Cece Winans and Bebe Winans on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno 12/23/10|last=Fusemix}}</ref>

In 2017, Winans released a tenth album, ''[[Let Them Fall in Love]]'', for which she won two Grammy Awards for Best Gospel Performance/Song and Best Gospel Album. In 2021, Winans released her first live worship album, ''Believe For It''.
