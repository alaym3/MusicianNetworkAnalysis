{{nihongo|'''''Yuri on Ice'''''|ユーリ!!! on ICE|lead=yes}} <onlyinclude>is a Japanese sports anime television series about [[figure skating]]. The series was produced by [[MAPPA]], directed and written by [[Sayo Yamamoto]] with original scripts by [[Mitsurō Kubo]] under the chief direction of Jun Shishido. Character designs were handled by Tadashi Hiramatsu, and its music was composed by Taro Umebayashi and Taku Matsushiba. The figure skating was choreographed by [[Kenji Miyamoto (figure skater)|Kenji Miyamoto]], who also performed routines himself which were recorded and used as skating sound effects. The series premiered on October 6, 2016 and ended on December 22, with a total of 12 episodes. A ''Yuri on Ice'' feature film, ''Ice Adolescence'', was originally planned for release in 2019, but has been delayed to a later date. The series revolves around the relationships between Japanese figure skater [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Yuri Katsuki|Yuri Katsuki]]; his idol, Russian figure-skating champion [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Victor Nikiforov|Victor Nikiforov]], and up-and-coming Russian skater [[List of Yuri on Ice characters#Yuri Plisetsky|Yuri Plisetsky]]; as Yuri K. and Yuri P. take part in the [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Figure Skating Grand Prix]], with Victor acting as coach to Yuri K.</onlyinclude>

''Yuri on Ice'' has been well received in Japan. It won three awards at the [[Tokyo Anime Award Festival]], a Japan Character Award, seven awards in [[Crunchyroll]]'s inaugural [[Crunchyroll#The Anime Awards|Anime Awards]], and in 2019 was named by the website's editorial team as one of the top 25 anime of the 2010s. In Japan, the series was released in six parts on Blu-ray and DVD, with all the releases coming No. 1 on the [[Oricon]] Animation Blu-ray disc and Animation DVD disc rankings respectively. It was the eighth-most successful media franchise in Japan for 2017, had the second-highest combined Blu-ray and DVD sales of any anime in Japan for 2017, and had the highest combined sales for a TV anime that year. It was popular on social media outlets such as [[Tumblr]], [[Sina Weibo]] and [[Twitter]], where it received over a million more tweets than the next most-talked about anime series in the season it was broadcast. It also attracted praise from professional figure skaters, with some skaters in the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] performing to music from the show.

''Yuri on Ice'' has raised discussion concerning its depiction of a same-sex relationship between its protagonists, with some critics praising it for covering homosexuality in a way that differs from most anime and manga such as the [[yaoi]] genre, and for dealing with homosexuality in a country and sport that has present-day issues with homophobia. Others criticized its depiction for being unrealistic, and of visual censorship that arguably makes it ambiguous to some viewers. The series has also been praised for its depiction of [[anxiety]], and also raised a brief controversy concerning a similar figure skating-based title that was released in the United States in 2017.

==Plot==
{{see also|List of Yuri on Ice characters|List of Yuri on Ice episodes}} 
After a crushing defeat in the [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|Grand Prix Final]] and other competition losses, 23-year-old Japanese figure skater Yuri Katsuki develops mixed feelings about skating and puts his career on hold; returning to his hometown of Hasetsu in [[Kyushu]]. Yuri visits his childhood friend, Yuko, at an ice rink (Ice Castle Hasetsu) and perfectly mimics an advanced skating routine performed by his idol: Russian figure skating champion Victor Nikiforov. When secretly recorded footage of Yuri's performance is uploaded to the internet, it catches Victor's attention, and he travels to Kyushu with an offer to coach Yuri and revive his figure-skating career.{{efn|name=Episode 1|{{cite episode|title=Nan no Piroshiki!!

After learning about Victor's career decision, Yuri Plisetsky, a rising 15-year-old Russian prodigy skater, travels to Hasetsu to make Victor keep a promise made prior to the beginning of the series. Victor had promised he would choreograph a routine specifically for Yuri P. if he won the Junior World Championships, which Yuri P. presumably did. Victor, having forgotten about his promise to Yuri P., makes the two Yuris compete against each other to decide who he will coach. He chooses two songs for the skaters, both with the same melody but with a different meaning. The first song, "[[Agape]]", was about unconditional love, and is given to Yuri P. The second song, "Eros," is about sexual love, and is given to Yuri K.{{efn|name=Episode 2|{{cite episode|title=Futari no Yūri! ?

Both Yuri K. and Yuri P. qualify to represent their countries in the Grand Prix series, and then later qualify for the Grand Prix Final in [[Barcelona]]. Over the course of the Grand Prix, Yuri K. and Victor become increasingly close, with the two of them kissing in public.{{efn|name=Episode 7|{{cite episode|title=Guranpurishirīzu kaimaku!

The skating sounds for each sequence were recorded separately. No stock sounds were used for the sequences because each part sounds different, and no footage of professional skaters was used because the music in the programmes normally muffles the sounds. Thus the sounds used were recorded and performed by series choreographer Miyamoto, and each skating sequence is unique to the program.<ref name="Morrisey"/>

He wrote that some people argued the fans were drawn to the anime as a form of escapism following the [[2016 in politics|political events of 2016]] among other factors, but he responded to this saying that:

<blockquote>The problem with this reductive view is that it assumes ''Yuri!!! on Ice'' is anywhere near as lightweight and fluffy as its sparkly cover art might suggest. (It's also just a gilded version of the more common "only horny fangirls care about this" argument, meant to delegitimize the show's audience and therefore its merits as a work of art.)<ref name="ANN Blu-Ray review">{{cite web|last=Chapman|first=Jacob|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/yuri-on-ice/bd-dvd-the-complete-series-le/.127657|title=Review: Yuri!!! on ICE BD+DVD - The Complete Series [LE]|publisher=Anime News Network|date=April 3, 2018|access-date=April 3, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180403204139/https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/review/yuri-on-ice/bd-dvd-the-complete-series-le/.127657|archive-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref></blockquote>

There hasn't even been a for real [[Same-sex marriage in Japan|gay marriage in Japan]], so this show is depicting something that isn't legally possible in its country of origin".<ref name="Episode 10"/> For ''Anime UK News'', Ian Wolf called the exchange of rings "the best scene in the series".<ref name="Anime UK News 2"/> According to Wolf, the anime is an example of the [[Odagiri effect]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Wolf|first=Ian|url=http://site.animeuknews.info/2017/01/05/feature-a-guide-to-the-odagiri-effect/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208180125/http://site.animeuknews.info/2017/01/05/feature-a-guide-to-the-odagiri-effect/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 8, 2017|title=Feature: A Guide to the Odagiri effect|publisher=Anime UK News|date=January 5, 2017|access-date=January 8, 2017}}</ref>

''Yuri on Ice'' has highlighted homophobia in figure skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback in which a younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly gay figure skater [[Johnny Weir]], who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career.{{efn|name=Episode 7}}<ref name="Straight Guys"/> Weir said in an interview with ''The Geekiary'',

<blockquote>I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I think many of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if ''Yuri on Ice'' will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps.<ref name="Geekiary"/></blockquote>

The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition.{{efn|name=Episode 12}}<ref name="Anime UK News 2"/> Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning [[LGBT rights]].<ref name="Anime UK News 1"/>

''Yuri on Ice'' differs from other anime covering same-sex relationships, such as [[yaoi]] and [[yuri (genre)|yuri]]. Carli Velocci of ''[[Geek.com]]'' wrote,

<blockquote>Their relationship exists somewhere beyond any sexuality, meaning it doesn't fall into the same traps that a lot of yuri and yaoi relationships do ... While this isn't the first anime with a same-sex couple at the forefront, it's one of the first to present a story that isn't strictly sexual and is mutual. Yuri and Victor complement each other, but both also admit that they've grown as people because of the presence of the other. The equality in their relationship is revolutionary, even if it wasn't the first to depict one. You can assign the [[Yaoi#Seme and uke|"seme" or "uke"]] label to Victor and Yuri, but when it comes to their psychological bond, it's more equal ... Yuri and Victor aren't just another gay anime couple. They're almost real.<ref>{{cite web|last=Velocci |first=Carli |url=https://www.geek.com/television/yuri-on-ice-is-a-non-traditional-gay-anime-romance-1683540/ |title='Yuri on Ice' is a Non-Traditional Gay Anime Romance |publisher=Geek.com |date=December 27, 2016 |access-date=December 28, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228140621/http://www.geek.com/television/yuri-on-ice-is-a-non-traditional-gay-anime-romance-1683540/ |archive-date=December 28, 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>

A review in ''[[Otaku USA]]'' has argued that the skaters take on an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] appearance when they are performing, saying:

<blockquote>While on ice in the series proper, the main performers often take on an androgynous appearance to feed the show's substance. Yuri's evolution in terms of confidence and capabilities is at the core of the plot, but the heart lies in Yuri's exploration of his feminine side via emotional expression. ... Gender roles are further addressed via Viktor's {{sic}} lines of encouragement to Yuri that, at least as translated, imply both skating direction and romantic suggestion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ink|url=http://www.otakuusamagazine.com/Anime/News1/Yuri-on-Ice-is-chockfull-of-memorable-characters-a-8626.aspx|title=Yuri!!! on Ice is chockfull of memorable characters and masterful choreography.|publisher=Otaku USA|date=February 4, 2017|access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref></blockquote>

====Criticism====
The relationship has also been criticized as unrealistic, with Yuri K. and Victor not receiving the homophobic abuse they would experience in real life.<ref name="Episode 10"/> Others have remarked that some viewers might refuse to acknowledge the relationship because the homosexuality was not explicit. Although the "kiss" is obscured by Victor's arm, it is implicit.{{efn|name=Episode 7}} Cecilia D'Anastasio of ''[[Kotaku]]'' wondered why the "kiss" was blocked when other anime, such as ''[[From the New World (novel)|From the New World]]'', had depicted gay kisses.<ref name="Kotaku"/> Wolf of ''Anime UK News'' originally said of the scene that: "I'm 99.999% sure the kiss did occur, but that 0.001% is horribly getting to me. I don't want to go by what everyone else sees – I want to see what is actually going on, and share in the reaction of the characters at the same time as them".<ref name="Anime UK News 1"/> However, by the twelfth episode, he said that the scene in which Victor cries was the proof he wanted:

<blockquote>If the kiss is the initial spark, and the rings the visible sign of love, then the tears are proof that you don't want it to end. I have been saying all the time that what I wanted was text rather than [[subtext]] – but in end, I think the subtext did actually pay off.<ref name="Anime UK News 2"/></blockquote>

==''Love on Ice'' controversy==
In January 2017 the [[Hallmark Channel]] announced the release of a TV movie, ''Love on Ice'', about the relationship between a female figure skater in a career slump and her new male coach. It was seen by some fans of ''Yuri on Ice'' as [[plagiarism]] due to plot similarities, and Hallmark was accused of trying to "straightwash" the relationship between Yuri Katsuki and Victor Nikiforov. Fans of ''Yuri on Ice'' responded to ''Love on Ice'' by posting a [[Change.org]] petition demanding an explanation of the similarities between the two stories and hijacking ''Love on Ice''{{'s}} [[IMDb]] page to contain the plot summary of ''Yuri on Ice''. The similarity between the stories is apparently coincidental, since ''Love on Ice'' began filming in early November 2016 (about a month after ''Yuri on Ice'' began broadcasting).<ref name="Love on Ice">{{cite web|last=Baker-Whitelaw |first=Gavia |url=http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-love-on-ice-hallmark-channel-movie/ |title=Anime fans accuse Hallmark Channel of copying 'Yuri on Ice' |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=January 3, 2017 |access-date=January 3, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170104144619/http://www.dailydot.com/parsec/yuri-love-on-ice-hallmark-channel-movie/ |archive-date=January 4, 2017 }}</ref> According to Hallmark, no one involved in the making of ''Love on Ice'' had heard of ''Yuri on Ice''.
