== Career ==
Vann embarked on his career as a member of AliveSinceForever, a group that started on the forum KanyeToThe in 2010, from which [[Brockhampton (band)|Brockhampton]] would eventually form.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/03/brockhampton-explained/|title=Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Brockhampton (But Were Afraid to Ask)|website=Complex|language=en|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> He was featured on their only project, ''The ASF EP'', released on July 29, 2013, on the tracks "Silent Water" and "Rabbits", both with [[Kevin Abstract]].

Vann also released an eponymous EP, titled ''Ameer Vann EP'', on October 29, 2013. He was one of the founding members of Brockhampton in 2015, and along with Kevin Abstract, contributed to "a fair amount of the group's image and vision".<ref name=":1" /> Vann has been called, "the face of the ''Saturation'' trilogy", being featured on the covers of Brockhampton's 2017 albums, ''[[Saturation (Brockhampton album)|Saturation]]'', ''[[Saturation II]]'', and ''[[Saturation III]]''.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /><ref name=pitchfork>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/brockhamptons-ameer-vann-accused-of-sexual-misconduct-responds/|title=BROCKHAMPTON's Ameer Vann Accused of Sexual Misconduct, Responds|last=Yoo|first=Noah|date=May 14, 2019|website=Pitchfork|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=September 18, 2019}}</ref>

However, the group decided to part ways with Vann on May 27, 2018, following sexual abuse allegations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/brockhampton-kick-ameer-vann-following-sexual-assault-allegations-2326510|title=Brockhampton kick Ameer Vann out following sexual and mental abuse allegations|last=Bowman|first=Lisa|date=2018-05-27|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> After a hiatus and disappearance from social media, Vann reemerged on September 16, 2019 to announce the release of his debut commercial project [[Emmanuel (EP)|''Emmanuel'']], the following night.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/ex-brockhampton-rapper-ameer-vann-releases-new-music-following-sexual-abuse-allegations-2549242|title=Ex-Brockhampton rapper Ameer Vann releases new music following sexual abuse allegations|last=Jones|first=Damian|date=2019-09-18|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-18}}</ref> Vann's first solo live performance was at Sound Of Brazil (S.O.B.'s) in [[New York City]] on September 23, 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/ameer-vann-tickets-73478236383|title = Ameer Vann}}</ref> The setlist included tracks from ''Emmanuel'' and older tracks from 2017, as well as unreleased songs.

On October 15, 2020, Vann released the [[Brandon Bell (record producer)|Donut]]-produced single "Keep Your Distance" via Winston Wolf and [[RCA Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ameer Vann Wants You To "Keep Your Distance"|url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ameer-vann-wants-you-to-keep-your-distance-new-song.1989001.html|access-date=2020-10-20|website=HotNewHipHop|language=en}}</ref> On January 14, 2021, Vann released a second single titled "IDFIATOK" (an acronym for "I Don't Fit In and That's OK").<ref>{{cite web |title=Ameer Vann Returns With Creative "IDFIATOK" Single & Video |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/ameer-vann-returns-with-creative-idfiatok-single-and-video-new-song.1989922.html |access-date=14 January 2021}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
Vann is best known for his laid back flow and his frequent use of themes of [[racism]], [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]], [[substance abuse]] and [[introspection]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stanforddaily.com/2017/11/14/a-look-at-brockhampton-a-hip-hop-anti-collective-all-american-boyband/|title=A look at BROCKHAMPTON, a hip-hop anti-collective All-American Boyband|last=Grosz|first=Dylan|date=2017-11-14|website=The Stanford Daily|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-19}}</ref>

== Controversies ==

=== Misconduct allegations ===

In May 2018, Vann was the subject of sexual misconduct and abuse allegations, after multiple women came forward detailing their experiences; some of which included him being, "emotionally manipulative, and mentally abusive", and engaging in sexual relations with a minor.<ref name=pitchfork  /><ref name="Two Women Detail Abuse">{{cite magazine |last1=Aniftos |first1=Rania |title=Former BROCKHAMPTON Member Ameer Vann: Two Women Detail Abuse Allegations |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8459953/ameer-vann-brockhampton-two-women-describe-sexual-misconduct-accusations |magazine=Billboard |date=June 7, 2018}}</ref> He later responded to the allegations, denying sexual misconduct or sexual relations with a minor, in a series of [[Twitter|tweets]].<ref name=pitchfork /><ref name="Two Women Detail Abuse"/>

{{Quote box|width=25%|quote="In response to the claims of emotional and sexual abuse: Although my behavior has been selfish, childish, and unkind, I have never criminally harmed anyone or disrespected their boundaries. I have never had relations with a minor or violated anybody's consent."<ref name=pitchfork />}}

As a result, Brockhampton delayed, and ultimately shelved the release of their then-upcoming fourth studio album ''Puppy'', which was scheduled to be released the following month, as well as cancelling their remaining tour dates.<ref name=":2" /> On May 27, a statement was issued by the group announcing Vann's departure.<ref name=kim /><ref>{{Cite tweet|user=brckhmptn|number=1000705013747015680|title=pic.twitter.com/49lWbDcXzl|date=2018-05-27|access-date=2019-09-17}}</ref>

=== Robbery accusations ===

In December 2018, former bandmate Dom McLennon posted a tweet claiming that Vann had arranged for one of his friends to be robbed, and did not reveal his involvement until after the controversy that led to his departure.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Findlay |first1=Mitch |title=Dom McLennon Accuses Ameer Vann Of Setting His Friend Up To Be Robbed |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/dom-mclennon-accuses-ameer-vann-of-setting-his-friend-in-robbery-news.66718.html |website=HotNewHipHop |access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref> McLennon later addressed this in Brockhampton's "Dearly Departed" from their 2019 album ''[[Ginger_(Brockhampton_album)|Ginger]]'', elaborating on the robbery and further criticising Vann's behaviour.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yassin |first1=Diana |title='Dearly Departed:' A message to Ameer Van |url=https://www.michigandaily.com/arts/dearly-departed-message-ameer-van/ |website=The Michigan Daily |date=4 September 2019 |access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref> Vann denied the allegations in a freestyle he posted on his Instagram page in March 2021.<ref>{{Citation|title=GOSSIPY FLOW|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SRRDTdhLMY|language=en|access-date=2021-04-10}}</ref>
