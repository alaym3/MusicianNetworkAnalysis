'''Tigers Jaw''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], formed in 2005. Their first album, ''Belongs to the Dead'', was released in 2006. They released a 7-inch single, "Spirit Desire", in 2009, on [[Tiny Engines]].<ref name="tinyenginesspiritdesire5">{{cite web|url=http://www.tinyengines.net/releases/spirit-desire/|title=Tiny Engines Spirit Desire|publisher=Tiny Engines Records|access-date=June 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522140600/http://www.tinyengines.net/releases/spirit-desire/|archive-date=May 22, 2011}}</ref> They released two more albums before announcing a hiatus in March 2013; however, their record label [[Run for Cover Records]] announced in August 2013 that the band's breakup was not official. Their fourth album, ''[[Charmer (Tigers Jaw album)|Charmer]]'', came out in June 2014, and their fifth, ''[[Spin (Tigers Jaw album)|Spin]]'', in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/runforcoverrecords/posts/10151760675387398|title=Tigers Jaw never said they were breaking... - Run For Cover Records|website=Facebook.com|access-date=May 15, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years and ''Tigers Jaw'' (2006–2012)===
The band's name is a reference to a song by [[lo-fi]] band [[The Microphones]]. They also have a number of songs whose titles reference songs by the band. Members Ben Walsh and [[Adam McIlwee]] started the group during high school, with Brianna Collins joining after the first couple of months.<ref name="vansgirls.tumblr.com">{{Cite web|url=https://vansgirls.tumblr.com/post/154520968464/vans-girls-music-crushes-brianna-collins-meet-the|title=Vans Girls|website=Vansgirls.tumblr.com}}</ref> They have cited [[Fall Out Boy]] and [[My Chemical Romance]] as early musical influences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7736464/tigers-jaw-interview-spin-will-yip-black-cement-label|title=Tigers Jaw & Will Yip Talk 'Spin,' New Label Black Cement &#124; Billboard|date=March 24, 2017|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

[[AbsolutePunk]] gave their self-titled album a generally positive review, noting that "Tigers Jaw is fueled by emotionally-driven lyrics brought to life by vocalist Adam McIlwee, whose voice is one of those that reveal passion while at the same time giving the impression that he's barely trying. Aforementioned opener "The Sun" is one of the better tracks on the album, offering up a well-organized mix of Tigers Jaw's two personas."<ref name="absolutepunk6">{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1640892 |title=Tigers Jaw - Tigers Jaw |publisher=Absolute Punk.net|access-date=June 16, 2011}}</ref>

Another punk music website, Punknews.org, in their critique of the band's eponymous album, felt that the tracks "Plane vs. Tank vs. Submarine" and "Chemicals" were particularly notable for "solid guitar work in the form of weeping, goosebump-inducing solos. Strong vocal harmonies and bouncy guitar work carry both 'I Saw Water' and 'Heat' to heights other bands would have a hard time reaching."<ref name="punknews7">{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/review/7813 |title=Tigers Jaw - Tigers Jaw |publisher=Punknews.org|access-date=June 16, 2011}}</ref> In November 2012, the group supported [[Title Fight]] on their headlining US tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/title_fight_announce_headlining_tour_dates_with_pianos_become_the_teeth_and|title=Title Fight announce headlining tour dates with Pianos Become The Teeth and Single Mothers|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|author=Colwell, Matthew |date=August 13, 2012|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref>

===''Charmer'' (2013–2016)===
On March 21, 2013, Tigers Jaw made an announcement on their Tumblr: {{pullquote|"After our show in Scranton two weeks ago, Adam, Pat, and Dennis let Ben and I know that for personal reasons they are unable to do Tigers Jaw anymore. This was a surprise for the both of us, but everyone is on good terms, and we respect and support them and their decisions.

A full band Tigers Jaw lineup (consisting of Ben and I with the help of some talented friends) will be doing a full US tour in May–June as well as the UK dates of the previously announced tour with the Menzingers in August. We regret to announce that we will have to cancel the mainland Europe dates. We apologize to the promoters, venues, and anyone who bought tickets.

These are likely to be the last Tigers Jaw tours for the foreseeable future. U.S. tour dates will be announced soon. Thanks.

- Brianna"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tigersjaw.tumblr.com/post/45930763879/announcement |title=tigers jaw — Announcement |publisher=Tigersjaw.tumblr.com |date=2013-03-21 |access-date=2015-05-15}}</ref>}}

Many fans interpreted this announcement to mean that the band was breaking up. However, both Walsh and Collins clarified that they would continue with Tigers Jaw as a two-piece. Members of [[Basement (band)|Basement]] filled in during their 2013 UK tour, while members of [[Balance and Composure]] filled in for the US dates. After the announcement, Brianna did an interview, where she said that "I know Ben and I really want to work on a new record, put something out. It’ll happen."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thewaster.com/interview/tigers-jaw-an-interview-with-brianna-collins/|title=Tigers Jaw: An Interview with Brianna Collins|website=Thewaster.com}}</ref>

After leaving Tigers Jaw, Adam McIlwee pursued his experimental solo project [[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]]. Under this name, McIlwee blended emo and goth esthetics with [[Cloud rap|cloud rap]] and [[Trap music|trap]], became a key member in musical groups such as THRAXXHOUSE and [[GothBoiClique]], and famously collaborated with the late [[Lil Peep]]. 

Tigers Jaw announced their next studio album, ''Charmer'', on March 21, 2014, along with the single "Nervous Kids". ''Charmer'' reached No. 49 on the Billboard Charts. They played a U.S. tour with [[Touché Amoré]] and [[Dads (band)|Dads]] in mid-2014.

They went on a U.S. tour with [[Lemuria (American band)|Lemuria]] and [[Somos (band)|Somos]] in early 2015. In May 2015, it was announced that Tigers Jaw would be touring the U.S. with [[New Found Glory]] and [[Yellowcard]] in late 2015. In June 2015, the band played in Brazil and performed three acoustic shows in New York, Philadelphia, and Somerville. Tigers Jaw toured Australia in July 2015. In August 2015, they toured in the UK/Europe with [[Foxing (band)|Foxing]]. The band then performed various acoustic shows before undertaking another UK/Europe tour with [[Basement (band)|Basement]] in February and March 2016.

===''spin'', ''Eyes Shut'', and ''I Won't Care How You Remember Me'' (2017–present)===
On March 22, 2017, ''[[Spin (Tigers Jaw album)|spin]]'' was announced for release on May 19 through Black Cement Records, with a U.S. tour starting the same day.<ref>{{ cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2017/03/22/520948300/tigers-jaw-after-shakeup-announces-new-record-and-shares-new-song-guardian |title=TIGERS JAW, After Shakeup, Announces New Record And Shares New Song 'Guardian' |website=Npr.org |author=Lars Gotrich |access-date=March 23, 2017}}</ref> The album saw the release of three singles: "Guardian," "June" and "Window." In 2018, the band also performed several shows commemorating the ten-year anniversary of the band's self-titled album.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Casteel |first1=Beth |title=TIGERS JAW ANNOUNCE S/T 10-YEAR ANNIVERSARY TOUR |url=https://www.altpress.com/news/tigers-jaw-10-year-self-title-tour-sidekicks-2018/ |website=Alternative Press |access-date=August 17, 2020}}</ref>

In 2019, the band released a new stand-alone single, "Eyes Shut." The track was recorded in the sessions for ''spin'', but did not make the final cut. The single served as the title track of a new EP, which paired it with acoustic versions of "Guardian," "Follows" and "Eyes Shut."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hojsak |first1=Sarah |title=Tigers Jaw surprise released a surprise acoustic EP, Eyes Shut |url=https://thekey.xpn.org/2019/10/02/tigers-jaw-eyes-shut/ |website=The Key |publisher=WXPN Radio |access-date=August 17, 2020}}</ref> 2019 also saw the addition of touring musicians Teddy Roberts and Colin Gorman as full-time members of Tigers Jaw.

In 2020, the band released a new song entitled "Warn Me." It marked the band's first release as part of the [[Hopeless Records]] roster. Although "Warn Me" would not appear on the band's then-untitled sixth studio album, the band confirmed they had been in the studio with [[Will Yip]] working on it.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoo |first1=Noah |title=Tigers Jaw Share New Song “Warn Me” |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/tigers-jaw-share-new-song-warn-me-listen/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=August 17, 2020}}</ref>

In October 2020, the band released a new single, "Cat's Cradle." It serves as the official lead single to the band's sixth album, ''I Won't Care How You Remember Me''. The album is set for release on March 5, 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoo |first1=Noah |title=Tigers Jaw Announce New Album, Share Video for New Song: Watch |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/tigers-jaw-announce-new-album-share-video-for-new-song-watch/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=November 10, 2020}}</ref>
