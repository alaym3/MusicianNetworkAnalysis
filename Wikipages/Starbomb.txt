'''Starbomb''' was an American [[Comedy music|musical-comedy]] group composed of [[Dan Avidan]] and [[Brian Wecht]] of musical-comedy duo [[Ninja Sex Party]] together with [[Adobe Flash|Flash animator]] and [[Internet celebrity|Internet personality]] [[Arin Hanson]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.duelinganalogs.com/video/luigis-ballad/|title=Luigi’s Ballad|publisher=[[Dueling Analogs]]|first=Steve|last=Napierski|date=2013-12-19|access-date=2014-03-15}}</ref> and "space rock masters" [[TWRP (band)|TWRP]], a Canadian music group known for collaborations with NSP. The songs of Starbomb consist of video game parodies; Avidan provides sung vocals, Hanson provides rapping vocals, and Wecht performs instruments. All three are also known as a part of [[YouTube]] [[Let's Play (video gaming)|Let's Play]] [[web series]] ''[[Game Grumps]]''.

To date the group has released three studio albums, ''[[Starbomb (album)|Starbomb]]'', ''[[Player Select]]'' and ''The TryForce''. Starbomb has also released several music videos, which occasionally feature known Internet, film, and video game fandom personalities such as [[Markiplier]] and [[Ashly Burch]]. Although the project was not announced until 2013, Hanson stated that the band had actually been formed "way before", without specifying when.<ref name="ArinWikipediasHimself">{{Citation|last=[[Game Grumps]]|title=Arin Wikipedias Himself - PART 3 - Game Grump|date=2018-07-11|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM1rkW_Uqdk|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and ''Starbomb'' (2013)===
{{Main|Starbomb (album)}}
In summer 2013, Avidan began making comments about creating a new music project with Wecht and Hanson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kvw6febMYQ|title=NinjaSexParty Dan, Commander Holly, and Chad - FriendZone! - Polaris|publisher=[[YouTube]], [[Google]]|work=Polaris|access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref> The project wasn't officially announced until December 2, 2013, when the group released a preview of their song "I Choose You to Die" on Ninja Sex Party's official YouTube channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://showyou.com/v/y-DU-HvaBSVAU/egoraptor-and-nsp-are-starbomb?u=egoraptor|title=Egoraptor and NSP are STARBOMB!|publisher=Show You|work=Arin Hanson|access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://pixcelation.com/2013/12/02/egoraptor-and-ninja-sex-party-announce-their-newest-project-starbomb/|title=Egoraptor and Ninja Sex Party announce their newest project: STARBOMB|last=Herd|first=James|publisher=[[WordPress]]|work=Pixcelation Entertainment|access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref> They also announced that their first album, the self-titled ''[[Starbomb (album)|Starbomb]]'', would be released only two weeks later on December 17, 2013.

In the weeks following its release, ''Starbomb'' placed on multiple ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, reaching #1 on [[Comedy Albums]] and [[Heatseekers Albums]].<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> Music videos for several of the album's songs such as "Luigi's Ballad" (in which [[Rachel Bloom]] voiced Princess Peach) and "It's Dangerous to Go Alone" were released to YouTube that same year and in spring of the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/starbomb-is-here-shove-it-in-your-eyes-and-earholes-267648.phtml|title=Starbomb is here, shove it in your eyes and earholes|last=Bonds|first=Ian|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/ryu-and-ken-have-a-rap-battle-about-their-dicks-272132.phtml|title=Ryu and Ken have a rap battle about their dicks|last=Aziz|first=Hamza|date=2014-03-18|publisher=[[Destructoid]]|access-date=2014-03-19}}</ref> [[Destructoid]] commented on the album's release, stating that "While the concept itself may seem a bit juvenile, the awesome music (provided by Ninja Sex Party) and hilarious situations are more than enough to keep the more "mature" fan entertained."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.destructoid.com/starbomb-is-here-shove-it-in-your-eyes-and-earholes-267648.phtml|title=Starbomb is here, shove it in your eyes and earholes|last=Bonds|first=Ian|website=Destructoid|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref>

===''Player Select'' (2014)===
{{Main|Player Select}}
''Starbomb''<nowiki/>'s final song, "Outro," hinted at a future album. However, no official confirmation of a second album was forthcoming until fall of the following year. On December 16, 2014 Starbomb's second album, ''Player Select'', was released. Like its predecessor, snippets of the album's songs were released on YouTube prior to its release. Additionally, ''Player Select'' placed on several ''Billboard'' charts, and achieved #1 on Comedy Albums.<ref name=":2" /> ''Player Select'' also charted on position #3 on ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s end of year charts for US Comedy Albums.<ref name=":3" /> [[AllMusic]] gave the album an overall favorable review, remarking that "Plenty of swearing and 8-bit innuendo make this for the adult retro gamer and not the kids, but the laughs are plentiful and big."<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/player-select-mw0002792922|title=Player Select (review)|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-06-15}}</ref>

===''The TryForce'' and disbandment (2015-2021)===
In the video for "The Simple Plot of Metal Gear Solid", released on December 25, 2015, Hanson indicated there would be a third album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yAioZzuhOQg|title=The Simple Plot of Metal Gear Solid - ANIMATED MUSIC VIDEO by Studio Yotta - Starbomb|access-date=2016-08-30}}</ref>

On November 7, 2017, the official Instagram for the band posted images of Hanson and Wecht working on a new project, with the caption, "Interesting things are happening...".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BbNqPmXFV8C|title=Interesting things are happening...|website=Instagram|access-date=25 September 2021|date=7 November 2017|language=en}}</ref> On November 15, 2017, a third album was teased again, with the Starbomb Twitter account posting "hey @[[Tom Hanks|tomhanks]] do u want to do a guest verse on our next album, this is a serious offer" which never received an official response.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=930884476216971264|user=starbomb|title=hey @tomhanks do u want to do a guest verse on our next album, this is a serious offer<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

On a November 28, 2017 episode of ''Game Grumps'', Avidan and Hanson confirmed that they had finished recording the third Starbomb album in [[El Paso, Texas]]. The writing and recording process was very different from previous albums, as the trio challenged themselves by spending only one day writing and recording each song; they also mentioned a tentative release date of December 2018.<ref name="Tales of Recording">{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mRhE1qX9u0&t=321s|title=Super Mario Odyssey: Tales of Recording - PART 15 - Game Grumps|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref> [[Tupper Ware Remix Party]], Ninja Sex Party's frequent recording and touring partner band, will be featured on the album.<ref name="Tales of Recording"/> On a July 29, 2018 episode of ''Game Grumps'', Hanson and Avidan announced that the title of the upcoming album was ''The TryForce'', "as in, we're trying our best! We're a force that tries", with a planned December 2018 release.<ref name=":5">{{Citation|last=GameGrumps|title=We Wikipedia Dan: So Many Projects - PART 4 - Game Grumps|date=2018-07-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qwBEqslROM&t=846|access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref> On August 19, 2018, Ninja Sex Party mentioned in a [[Facebook]] post that ''The TryForce'' would be [[Record producer|produced]] by [[Jim Roach (producer)|Jim Roach]], who had produced their album ''[[Cool Patrol]]''; Wecht had acted as producer on previous Starbomb albums.<ref name="NSPRoach">{{Citation|last=[[Ninja Sex Party]]|title=Thank you, everybody, for your reaction to Cool Patrol.|date=August 18, 2018|url=https://www.facebook.com/ninjasexparty/posts/10155780431073927?__xts__%5B0%5D=68.ARBmWxQhYmRyYIRnblTQdv2taNN9CCy956-CUUSJnpqcK5Q0bBUsnkC45hNb8BieWinBl7Wk3Tdqj4kjIz1Xvv46MjVl11wC2FS04hPJRalCyMrPtI9qt9_yQy0DVVj_pa54x10J6zKN&__tn__=-R|access-date=August 19, 2018}}</ref>

Regarding the songwriting process, Hanson stated in July 2018 that the third album was an equal effort between the three members, in opposition to previous albums in which he felt that Avidan and Wecht were responsible for most of the songwriting. He stated "my footprint on the first two albums wasn't super huge. It was... Ninja Sex Party does video game songs, featuring Egoraptor, you know, whereas the third Starbomb album really feels like we all wrote it together."<ref name=ArinWikipediasHimself/> Later the same month, Avidan agreed that the new album would be more of a team effort.<ref name="DanWikipediasHimself">{{Citation|last=[[Game Grumps]]|title=We Wikipedia Dan: The Grump Years Begin - PART 3 - Game Grumps|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZDdE4Of4og|date=July 28, 2018|access-date=July 29, 2018}}</ref>

On December 23, 2018, the official Starbomb Twitter account released an image that was presumed to be a small portion of the album cover for ''The TryForce''.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1077034575522451456|user=starbomb|title=<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.

On January 8, 2019, in a ''Game Grumps'' video titled "2019 Game Grumps Updates + More!", Avidan and Hanson stated that ''The TryForce'' would be due for a late March 2019 release. On February 4, 2019, Starbomb announced in a new animated music video (for their first album's "Regretroid") that the album would instead be released on April 19, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPz22O-gp4Q|title=2019 Game Grumps Updates + More!|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5zL3FMyoq8|title=REGRETROID - Starbomb 3D Animated Music Video (by Antony Manley)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref> On March 29, 2019, a ''Game Grumps'' video titled "NEW STARBOMB ALBUM (2019)" confirmed that pre-orders for ''The TryForce'' would be available April 5, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEUnJ_M3D1Q|title=NEW STARBOMB ALBUM (2019)|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=20 November 2020}}</ref>

On April 5, 2019, a music video for "Blowing the Payload", Starbomb's first original song since 2014, was released on Egoraptor's YouTube channel, titled, "Overwatch RAP".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bbkU_PCimWY|title=Overwatch RAP Music Video - Starbomb (animated by Knights of the Light Table)|date=April 5, 2019|website=[[YouTube]]|access-date=April 7, 2019}}</ref> On April 12, 2019, another new video, for the song, "A Boy and His Boat", titled, "BEST Zelda Rap IN THE WORLD!!!" was uploaded to the same channel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=keAE9GXYB0w|title=BEST Zelda Rap IN THE WORLD!!! - ANIMATED MUSIC VIDEO!!

On April 19, 2019, the album was released, along with several new merch items.<ref>{{cite tweet|user=starbomb|number=1119311616086986752|title=We also have some AMAZING NEW MERCH in our store: 3 new shirts and 2 new pins!

On March 2, 2021, during an Instagram Q&A, a user asked Wecht "Was ''The TryForce'' album really the last Starbomb album?", to which Wecht responded with "Probably." Two days later, on an episode of ''Game Grumps'', Avidan stated that Starbomb had "essentially finish[ed] its run."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TRLZ4dcwes&t=594s|title=Guile's Speech Goes with Everything - Mario Maker|website=YouTube|access-date=25 September 2021}}</ref>
