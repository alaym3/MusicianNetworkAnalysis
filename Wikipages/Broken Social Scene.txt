'''Broken Social Scene''' is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[indie rock]] band, a [[musical collective]] including as few as six and as many as nineteen members, formed by [[Kevin Drew]] and [[Brendan Canning]].<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/06/07/broken-social-scene-reunion-field-trip_n_3384111.html "Broken Social Scene: Kevin Drew Calls Reunion A Reminder Of A 'Better' Rob Ford-Free Toronto"]. ''The Huffington Post Canada'', By Lonny Knapp. 06/07/2013</ref> Most of its members play in various other groups and solo projects, mainly in the city of [[Toronto]]. These associated acts include [[Metric (band)|Metric]], [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], [[Stars (Canadian band)|Stars]], [[Apostle of Hustle]], [[Do Make Say Think]], [[KC Accidental]], [[Emily Haines|Emily Haines & The Soft Skeleton]], [[Amy Millan]], and [[Jason Collett]].<ref name="CanadianEncyclopedia" />

The group's sound combines elements of all of its members' respective musical projects, and is occasionally considered [[baroque pop]]. It includes grand orchestrations featuring guitars, horns, woodwinds, and violins, unusual song structures, and an experimental, and sometimes chaotic production style from David Newfeld, who produced the second and third albums.<ref name=PM>{{cite web |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/brokensocialscene-youforgot |title=Broken Social Scene: You Forgot It in People |work=[[PopMatters]] |date=6 June 2003 |access-date=4 April 2019 |last=Begrand |first=Adrien}}</ref><ref name=PitchforkBSSreview>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/955-broken-social-scene/|title=Broken Social Scene: Broken Social Scene|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=October 3, 2005|access-date=4 April 2019|last=Dombal|first=Ryan}}</ref>

The collective and their respective projects have had a broad influence on alternative music and indie rock during the early 21st century, in 2021 [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] listed the band among the "most important artists" of the last 25 years.<ref>[https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/most-important-artists/ "The 200 Most Important Artists of Pitchfork’s First 25 Years"].

==History==
===''Feel Good Lost''===
The band was formed in [[1999 in music|1999]] by core members [[Kevin Drew]] and [[Brendan Canning]]. This duo recorded and released the band's [[ambient music|ambient]] debut album, ''[[Feel Good Lost]]'', on Noise Factory Records in 2001, with contributions by [[Justin Peroff]], [[Charles Spearin]], [[Bill Priddle]], [[Feist (singer)|Leslie Feist]], [[Jessica Moss]] and [[Stars (Canadian band)|Stars]]' [[Evan Cranley]].{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Drew and Canning's material at the time was almost entirely instrumental, so they brought together musicians from the Toronto indie scene, the album contributors as well as [[Andrew Whiteman]], [[Jason Collett]], and [[Metric (band)|Metric]]'s [[Emily Haines]], to flesh out their live show with lyrics and vocals. Over time, the band came to include contributions from [[James Shaw (musician)|James Shaw]], [[Justin Peroff]], [[John Crossingham]], and Stars member [[Amy Millan]].<ref name=CanadianEncyclopedia>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/broken-social-scene-emc/ "Broken Social Scene"]. ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', Steve McLean.</ref>

===''You Forgot It in People''===
All of the musicians from the live show joined Drew, Canning, Peroff and Spearin to record the band's second album, ''[[You Forgot It in People]]''. The album was produced by David Newfeld and released on [[Paper Bag Records]] in October 2002<ref name=ex>[http://exclaim.ca/music/article/broken_social_scene-torontos_ambassadors_to "Toronto's Ambassadors to the World"] By Michael Barclay". ''Exclaim!'', January 01, 2006</ref> and won the Alternative Album of the Year [[Juno Award]] in 2003.<ref name=ex /> The album also included musical contributions by Priddle, Jessica Moss, [[Brodie West]], Susannah Brady and [[Ohad Benchetrit]], but these were credited as supporting musicians rather than band members. On the supporting tour, the core band consisted of Drew, Canning, Peroff, Whiteman and Jason Collett, along whichever band members were available on each show date.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In 2003, the B-sides and remix collection ''[[Bee Hives]]'' was released.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Broken Social Scene's song "[[Lover's Spit]]" from 2002's ''You Forgot It in People'' has been featured in director [[Clément Virgo]]'s movie ''[[Lie with Me (film)|Lie with Me]]'' (2005), Paul McGuigan's ''[[Wicker Park (film)|Wicker Park]]'' (2004), [[Bruce McDonald (director)|Bruce McDonald]]'s ''[[The Love Crimes of Gillian Guess]]'' (2004), [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' (2003) and the penultimate episode of the Canadian series ''[[Terminal City (TV series)|''Terminal City'']]'' (2005). The version of "Lover's Spit" found on 2004's ''Bee Hives'' record was also featured in an episode of the third season of the FX series ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''. [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s television program ''[[The L Word]]'' featured "Pacific Theme" and "Looks Just Like the Sun", both from ''You Forgot It in People'', in the show's first season. "Lover's Spit" is referenced in the 2013 [[Lorde]] song, "[[Ribs (song)|Ribs]]". "Looks Just Like the Sun" was featured in the 2006 film ''Swedish Auto''. "Stars and Sons" from ''You Forgot It in People'' also appeared in the movie ''[[The Invisible (2007 film)|The Invisible]]''. Music from the band's albums was used to score the 2006 film ''[[Half Nelson (film)|Half Nelson]]''.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===''Broken Social Scene''===
Broken Social Scene released their third full-length album, ''[[Broken Social Scene (album)|Broken Social Scene]]'', also produced by Newfeld, in October 2005, with new contributors including [[k-os]], [[Jason Tait]] and [[Murray Lightburn]]. New band members were Newfeld and [[Torquil Campbell]], who were members of the band Stars. A limited edition EP, ''[[EP to Be You and Me]]'' was also printed along with the album.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Broken Social Scene performed "7/4 (Shoreline)" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' on January 31, 2006, and that year they performed "Ibi Dreams of Pavement" at the 2006 [[Juno Awards]], at which their self-titled album won the Alternative Album of the Year award. In August the band went on a European tour. Returning in September, they were last-minute replacement performers at North America's first [[Virgin Festival]], at [[Toronto Islands|Toronto Islands Park]] after headliners [[Massive Attack]] cancelled due to problems involving obtaining US visas. The band quickly assembled to play a one-hour closing performance on the main stage, following [[The Strokes]] and [[The Raconteurs]]. Through the performance the band was joined by Feist, Amy Millan of Stars, k-os, and Emily Haines of Metric. This was the last show featuring the entire 15 member lineup of the band until 2009.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

After a US tour in November, the band went on hiatus while members worked on their other projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spin.com/features/news/2006/07/060710_bss/ |title=Broken Social Scene to Go on Hiatus |publisher=Spin.com |date=2006-07-10 |access-date=2011-02-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208100554/http://www.spin.com/features/news/2006/07/060710_bss/ |archive-date=2008-02-08 }}</ref> In late 2006, several members of the band appeared as special guests on ''The Stars and Suns Sessions'', the second album from Mexican indie band [[Chikita Violenta]]. The album was produced by Dave Newfeld.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In May 2008, the band contributed a T-shirt design for the [[Yellow Bird Project]] to raise money and awareness for the Lake Ontario Waterkeeper. The shirt was designed by their drummer, [[Justin Peroff]], and bears the slogan "Hope for Truth".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/34199-bss-the-national-bon-iver-share-charity-t-shirts/ |title=BSS, the National, Bon Iver Share Charity T-Shirts &#124; News |website=Pitchfork |date=2008-12-05 |access-date=2014-05-22}}</ref>

===''Broken Social Scene Presents...''===
In June 2007, BSS founder Kevin Drew began recording an album which featured many members of Broken Social Scene. The album was produced by Ohad Benchetrit and Charles Spearin and was titled ''Broken Social Scene presents ..[[Spirit If...]]''. The album was recorded throughout 2004 and 2006 in Ohad Benchetrit's house while the band was not on tour. Although billed as a solo project, most Broken Social Scene members make cameo appearances. The sound itself is Broken Social Scene's familiar mix of rough and ragged, sad and celebratory, with psychedelic swells and acoustic jangles. Also featured are [[Dinosaur Jr.]]'s [[J Mascis]] and Canadian rock icon [[Tom Cochrane]] playing and singing and handclapping along.<ref name="AOL Music Canada">{{cite web|url=http://music.aol.ca/article/kevin-drew/153/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725140433/http://music.aol.ca/article/kevin-drew/153/|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 25, 2011|title=Broken Solo Scene|access-date=September 23, 2007}} Archived at the Wayback Machine.</ref> The album was released on September 18, 2007, and a tour billed as Broken Social Scene Performs Kevin Drew's ''Spirit If...'' took place in late 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

===''Forgiveness Rock Record''===
In June 2009, the band played a short set to launch ''[[This Book Is Broken]]'' at the [[North by Northeast]] festival. They played a mix of new songs from their then-upcoming album and old favourites, and were joined by Feist, who also joined them on their second visit to Mexico City in October.<ref name="CBC June 18, 2009">{{cite web |last1=Liss |first1=Sarah |title=NXNE 2009: This launch was Broken |url=https://www.cbc.ca/newsblogs/arts/the-buzz/2009/06/nxne-2009-this-launch-was-broken.html |website=[[CBC News]] |access-date=28 April 2019 |date=June 18, 2009}}</ref>

During the band's free performance at the Harbourfront Centre on July 11, 2009, they were joined by nearly all past contributors, including Feist, Emily Haines and James Shaw, Amy Millan and Evan Cranley, John Crossingham, Jason Collett and Julie Penner. This revue-like show celebrated other projects by members as well as including material from the then-upcoming album. Emcee Bruce McDonald announced the filming of a documentary directed by him and written by [[Don McKellar]], Titled ''[[This Movie Is Broken]]'', it includes concert footage and a fictional romance. Although McDonald announced at the concert that film submitted by fans would be used in the movie, the final cut of the movie included only one submission, a front-row recording of "Major Label Debut".{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Broken Social Scene released their fourth full-length album on May 4, 2010.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://radio3.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2010/1/Your-Guide-to-Upcoming-Canadian-Album-Releases-for-2010 | title=Your Guide to Upcoming Canadian Album Releases for 2010 | work=CBC News | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713032351/http://radio3.cbc.ca/#/blogs/2010/1/Your-Guide-to-Upcoming-Canadian-Album-Releases-for-2010 | archive-date=2010-07-13 }}</ref> Entitled ''[[Forgiveness Rock Record]]'', it was recorded at Soma in Chicago, with [[John McEntire]] producing, and in Toronto at the studio of Sebastian Grainger and James Shaw.

===''Lo-Fi for the Dividing Nights''===
During the recording of ''[[Forgiveness Rock Record]]'', the group also worked on tracks for ''Lo-Fi for the Dividing Nights'' while in [[Chicago]]. While [[John McEntire]] worked in the main room, during downtime band members would head into Soma's second smaller studio (B-Room) to test out and record new ideas and overdubs. One of their collaborations, "Me & My Hand", ended up being the closing song on ''Forgiveness Rock Record''; the rest became the beginnings of the later album.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

In October 2011 the band put on a show featuring [[Isaac Brock (musician)|Isaac Brock]] and went on a fall tour in support of [[TV on the Radio]].
