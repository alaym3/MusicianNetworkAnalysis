==Biography==
===Early years (1989–1995)===
DJ Shadow was experimenting with a four-track recorder while in high school in [[Davis, California]] (a college town near [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]), and began his music career as a disc jockey for the [[University of California, Davis]] campus radio station [[KDVS]].<ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Shadow Bio, Music, News & Shows |url=http://djz.com/featured_djs/dj-shadow/ |publisher=DJZ.com |access-date=March 7, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329140523/http://djz.com/featured_djs/dj-shadow/ |archive-date=March 29, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=DJ Shadow biography at Davis, CA wiki page|url=http://daviswiki.org/DJ_Shadow|access-date=22 January 2014}}</ref> During this period he was significant in developing the experimental hip-hop style associated with the London-based [[Mo' Wax]] record label. His early singles, including "In/Flux" and "Lost and Found (S.F.L.)", were genre-bending, merging elements of [[funk]], [[Rock and roll|rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[ambient music|ambient]], [[jazz]], [[soul music|soul]], and used-bin found records. Andy Pemberton, a music journalist writing for ''[[Mixmag]]'', described the single “In/Flux” as "[[trip hop]]," a term that had already been attached to Bristol, England-based groups [[Massive Attack]] and [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]] and the Bristol scene in general in June 1994.<ref name="mixmag">{{Cite news|last=Pemberton|first=Andy|date=June 1994|title=Trip Hop|magazine=Mixmag|url=https://88to98.co.uk/2014/03/29/mixmag-june-1994-trip-hop/}}</ref> He has cited [[Kurtis Mantronik]], [[Steinski]], and [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] as influences on his sample-based sound, further claiming that "lyrics (...) were confining, too specific."<ref name="Reynolds2013">{{cite book|author=Reynolds|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CXPZyYHLd-kC&pg=PT338|title=Energy Flash: A Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture|date=4 July 2013|publisher=Faber & Faber|isbn=978-0-571-28914-1|page=338}}</ref> His music rarely features more than short clips of voices or vocal work.

During 1991–1992, DJ Shadow remixes were released on [[Hollywood Records#Hollywood Basic|Hollywood BASIC]], a short-lived rap/hip-hop subsidiary label of Hollywood Records. Notable amongst these is a 1992 compilation release titled "BASIC Beats Sampler",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-BASIC-Beats-Sampler/release/379613|title=Various - BASIC Beats Sampler|website=Discogs}}</ref> which features a remix of "The Real Deal", a song by [[Lifers Group]], as well as a 12-plus-minute "Mega Mix" of the rest of the album, including tracks by west-coast underground hip-hop act, [[Raw Fusion]] and east-coast acts, [[Organized Konfusion]] and Zimbabwe Legit. Also in 1992, Shadow contributed [[scratching]] and production work to ''[[Sleeping with the Enemy (Paris album)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]'', the controversial second release by rapper [[Paris (rapper)|Paris]].

Early in 1993, Shadow was a part of the creation of the [[Solesides]] underground hip-hop label, in conjunction with [[Blackalicious]] and [[Lyrics Born]] (whose stage name at the time was Asia Born). The first 12" release on this new imprint was titled "Entropy,"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://djshadow.com/discography/dj-shadow-asia-born-entropy/|title=DJ Shadow / Asia Born: Entropy|website=Djshadow.com|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> with the A-side containing the Asia Born track "Send Them" and a dub rendition of the DJ Shadow track "Count and Estimate," and the entire B-side consisting of the 17-plus-minute title track. Rapper [[Gift of Gab (rapper)|Gift of Gab]] is featured in the version of "Count and Estimate" that appears in Entropy. Shadow continued to participate in releases on the Solesides label for years to come, until the label was disbanded in favor of [[Quannum Projects]].

Also in 1993, Mo' Wax's [[James Lavelle]] contacted Shadow about releasing "In/Flux" on the fledgling imprint. The association with Mo' Wax was a productive one; his tracks "In/Flux" and "Lost and Found" made their way onto some releases over the next few years. Shadow also worked with [[DJ Krush]] during this period. On a 1995 visit to the Mo' Wax Studios in London, England, Shadow was recruited to perform scratches on a Lavelle and [[Tim Goldsworthy]] mix of the Massive Attack song "[[Karmacoma]]".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.djshadow.com/release/massive-attack-karmacoma |title=Massive Attack: Karmacoma|website=Djshadow.com|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>

=== ''Endtroducing.....'', UNKLE and ''Scratch'' (1996–2001) ===
Shadow's first full-length work, ''[[Endtroducing.....]]'', was released in late 1996 to critical acclaim. ''Endtroducing'' would go on to make the ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' book for "First Completely Sampled Album" in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records Entry|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-1000/first-album-made-completely-from-samples/|access-date=10 October 2014|website=Guinness World Records}}</ref> The only pieces of equipment Shadow used to produce the album were the [[MPC60|AKAI MPC60]] 12-bit sampling drum machine, a pair of turntables and a borrowed-by-visiting [[Pro Tools]] setup from an early adopter of the technology, [[Dan the Automator|Dan "The Automator" Nakamura]].<ref name="Endtroducing notes" /> In November 2006, ''Time'' magazine named it one of its "All-Time" 100 best albums.<ref>{{cite news|date=16 November 2006|title=The All-TIME 100 Albums|work=Time|url=https://entertainment.time.com/2006/11/02/the-all-time-100-albums/slide/all/|access-date=2020-10-14}}</ref> In November 2014, automobile maker [[Chevrolet]] used a sample "Building Steam with a Grain of Salt" in a Chevy commercial.<ref>{{cite web|author=DeVille|first=Chris|date=November 17, 2014|title=I Watch DJ Shadow Soundtrack A Chevy Ad|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1719252/watch-dj-shadow-soundtrack-a-chevy-ad/video/|access-date=December 4, 2019|website=Stereogum}}</ref>

In 1998 Shadow released ''[[Preemptive Strike (album)|Preemptive Strike]]'', a compilation of 1993–1997 [[Single (music)|singles]] released on Mo' Wax. Later that year, he produced ''[[Psyence Fiction]]'', the debut album by [[Unkle|UNKLE]], a long-time Mo' Wax production team that featured guest appearances including [[Thom Yorke]] ([[Radiohead]]), [[Richard Ashcroft]] ([[The Verve]]), [[Mike D]] ([[Beastie Boys]]), [[Kool G. Rap]], and [[Jason Newsted]] ([[Metallica]]).<ref name="Crane2010">{{cite book|author=Crane|first=Larry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=foViXo_JV9YC&pg=PA198|title=Tape Op: The Book about Creative Music Recording|date=1 January 2010|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=978-0-9779903-0-6|page=198}}</ref>

Around 2000 he produced the score for the documentary ''[[Dark Days (documentary)|Dark Days]]'' filmed by British director [[Marc Singer (documentarian)|Marc Singer]]. This film is about a community of transients who live underground in a subway tunnel.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lu|first=Li|date=5 July 2011|title=Q&A with Marc Singer|url=http://anthemmagazine.com/qa-with-marc-singer/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Anthem Magazine}}</ref> It has six award wins in various competitions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0235327/awards|title=Dark Days|website=IMDb.com|access-date=December 4, 2019}}</ref> Shadow also starred in the 2001 movie ''[[Scratch (2001 film)|Scratch]]'', produced by [[Doug Pray]], alongside [[Z-Trip]], [[Grand Wizard Theodore]], [[Mix Master Mike]] and [[DJ Qbert]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=VanHorn|first=Teri|date=March 27, 2001|title=Q-Bert, DJ Shadow, Mix Master Mike In 'Scratch' Film|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1442218/q-bert-dj-shadow-mix-master-mike-in-scratch-film/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=MTV News|language=en}}</ref> He makes multiple appearances during the turntable and [[Record collecting|digging]] sections of the movie.

=== ''The Private Press'' and ''Live! In Tune and on Time'' (2002–2005) ===
Nearly six years after his debut production album, his second album, ''[[The Private Press]]'', was released in June 2002. A video for his track "[[Six Days (song)|Six Days]]" was also released in 2002, directed by [[Wong Kar-wai]].

In protest against the 2003 [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], DJ Shadow collaborated with [[Zack de la Rocha]], releasing the song "March of Death" online for free.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2007-02-25|title=March Of Death|url=http://www.zackdelarocha.com/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225135819/http://www.zackdelarocha.com/|archive-date=February 25, 2007|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Zack de la Rocha}}</ref>

In 2004, Shadow's first feature-length DVD, ''[[Live! In Tune and On Time|Live! In Tune and on Time]]'', was released. It features a live performance in [[London]] that combines tracks and samples from past albums as well as his work with [[UNKLE]] and [[Quannum]], and emphasizes visuals, with the help of Bay Area projection artist Ben Stokes.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Zwickel|first=Jonathan|date=June 16, 2004|title=DJ Shadow: Live!: In Tune and On Time Review|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2376-live-in-tune-and-on-time/|access-date=2020-10-14|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

The book ''[[Behind the Beat]]'' documents Shadow's home studio (named "Reconstruction") through photos and a brief description (as of 2005).<ref name="BEHINDTHEBEAT">{{Cite book|last=Raph|title=Behind the Beat: Hip Hop Home Studios|date=November 15, 2005|publisher=Gingko Press|isbn=1-58423-197-1|pages=61}}</ref> It is "nestled within a leafy San Francisco suburb"<ref name="BEHINDTHEBEAT" /> and Shadow apparently moved to the area "to be closer to the local record store".<ref name="BEHINDTHEBEAT" /> It also states that "Shadow only keeps a small selection of vinyl at home with the rest occupying storage units around town".<ref name="BEHINDTHEBEAT" /> His equipment as of 2005, according to ''Behind the Beat'', consists of two [[Akai MPC]] 3000s and a [[Korg Triton]].<ref name="BEHINDTHEBEAT" /> His album ''[[Endtroducing]]'' was "created on an [[MPC60|AKAI MPC60]] and an [[ADAT]]".<ref name="BEHINDTHEBEAT" />

==Sampling==
DJ Shadow's work involves manipulating samples, taking rare and seldom-heard pieces of music and reworking them into parts and phrases for his songs. Many of his tracks feature dozens of samples from a wide array of styles and influences including rock, soul, funk, experimental, electronic and jazz. Shadow famously sampled American composer [[David Axelrod (musician)|David Axelrod]] on his collaboration with [[DJ Krush]], "Duality", sampling Axelrod's "The Warnings" (Part 1). The piano in "[[Midnight in a Perfect World]]" from 1996's ''[[Endtroducing]]'' was originally recorded for [[Pekka Pohjola]]'s "Sekoilu seestyy."<ref name="Endtroducing notes">{{cite AV media notes|others=DJ Shadow|year=1996|title=Endtroducing.....|type=liner notes|edition=deluxe|publisher=[[Island Records]]|id=0602498286821}}</ref> Although Shadow currently uses fewer samples than on his earlier albums, several examples feature on his 2006 album ''[[The Outsider (DJ Shadow album)|The Outsider]]''. His collaboration with [[David Banner]], "Seein' Thangs", features a [[synthesizer]] and vocals from Cecilia's "Crimson Red" and "Outsider Intro" includes an excerpt from [[Ron Geesin]]'s "Concrete Line Up" from the 1973 album, ''As He Stands''.<ref name="The Outsider notes">{{cite AV media notes|others=DJ Shadow|year=2006|title=The Outsider|type=liner notes|edition=special|publisher=[[Island Records]]|id=602517034686}}</ref>
