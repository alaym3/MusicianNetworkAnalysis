'''Fightstar''' are a British [[Rock music|rock]] band from London that formed in 2003. The band is composed of lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist [[Charlie Simpson]], guitarist and co-vocalist [[Alex Westaway]], bassist [[Dan Haigh]] and drummer Omar Abidi. Generally considered a [[post-hardcore]] band, Fightstar are known to incorporate [[heavy metal music|metal]], [[alternative rock]] and other genres into their sound. During the band's early days, they were viewed sceptically by critics because of Simpson's former [[pop music|pop]] career with [[Busted (band)|Busted]]. Their live shows got a more positive reaction, and their 2005 debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[They Liked You Better When You Were Dead]]'', was a critical success.

The band released their debut studio album, ''[[Grand Unification (album)|Grand Unification]]'', the following year; ''[[Kerrang!]]'' editor Paul Brannigan called it "one of the best British rock albums of the last decade".<ref name="York"/> Fightstar received a nomination  for Best British Band at the 2006 [[Kerrang! Awards|''Kerrang!'' Awards]] before releasing their second album, ''[[One Day Son, This Will All Be Yours]]'', in 2007. A [[compilation album]] including [[B-sides]] and rarities, ''[[Alternate Endings]]'', was released the following year. The band self-funded and co-produced their third album, ''[[Be Human (album)|Be Human]]'' (2009), which featured [[orchestral]] and [[choral]] elements. It was their highest-charting album, peaking at number 20 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].

Fightstar went on hiatus in 2010, allowing its members to concentrate on other projects. This included two [[folk music|folk]]-oriented solo records by Simpson and a [[synthwave (2000s genre)|synthwave]] side project operated by Westaway and Haigh called [[Gunship (band)|Gunship]]. Fightstar reunited in 2014 and released their fourth studio album, ''[[Behind the Devil's Back]]'', the following year. The record added electronic elements to their eclectic sound. All four studio albums have charted in the top 40 and received critical praise.<ref>{{cite web|title=I Am Fightstar |url=http://thisiswhoiam.kerrangradio.co.uk/Celebrities/View/Fightstar |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090814180144/http://thisiswhoiam.kerrangradio.co.uk/Celebrities/View/Fightstar |archive-date=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead |access-date=5 August 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> In November 2015, Fightstar once again went on hiatus, with Simpson rejoining Busted for the first time in over a decade.

==History==
==={{anchor|Origins (2003—2004)}}Origins (2003–2004)===
In 2003, when [[Charlie Simpson]] was still a member of the [[pop punk]] band [[Busted (band)|Busted]], he met fellow songwriter-guitarist [[Alex Westaway]] and drummer Omar Abidi at a party.<ref name="IamFS" /> During the party, an impromptu [[jam session]] took place. Simpson, Westaway and Abidi played a [[Loop (music)|loop]] of [[Rage Against the Machine]]'s "[[Killing in the Name]]", and agreed to attend a [[music concert|gig]] a few days later. After the show, they returned to Simpson's flat and played guitars and a [[Roland V-Drums|v-drum kit]]; they then wrote their first song, "Too Much Punch".<ref name="Omar"/> Westaway later invited his school friend Haigh to practise with the band, and they began booking rehearsal sessions.<ref name="IamFS"/> Abidi was studying [[sound engineering]] at college, and guitarist Alex Westaway had recently moved to London after dropping out of university. Future bassist Dan Haigh, also based in London, worked for a [[game development]] company.<ref name="Omar">{{cite web|url=http://www.crowdsurfer.net/fightstar-in-case-of-fire-liverpool-barfly-2509/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130221115008/http://www.crowdsurfer.net/fightstar-in-case-of-fire-liverpool-barfly-2509/ |archive-date=21 February 2013 |title=Fightstar – Liverpool – 02/05/09 |publisher=Crowdsurfer.net |access-date=2 May 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Simpson was becoming increasingly frustrated with Busted's music because he could not explore his own creative desires.
