'''David Van Cortlandt Crosby''' (born August 14, 1941) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. In addition to his solo career, he was a founding member of both [[the Byrds]] and [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young|Crosby, Stills & Nash]].

Crosby joined the Byrds in 1964. [[Bob Dylan]] gave the band their first number one hit in April 1965 with "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]". Crosby appeared on the Byrds' first five albums and produced the original lineup's [[Byrds (album)|1973 reunion album]]. In 1967 he joined [[Buffalo Springfield]] on stage at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]], which contributed to his dismissal from the Byrds. He subsequently formed [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]] in 1968 with [[Stephen Stills]] (of Buffalo Springfield) and [[Graham Nash]] of [[the Hollies]]. After the release of [[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|their debut album]] CSN won the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]] of 1969. [[Neil Young]] joined the group for live appearances, their second concert being [[Woodstock]], before recording their second album [[Déjà Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|''Déjà Vu'']]. Meant to be a group that could collaborate freely, [[Crosby and Nash]] recorded three gold albums in the 1970s, while the core trio of CSN remained active from 1976 until 2016. CSNY reunions took place in each decade from the 1970s through the 2000s.

Songs Crosby wrote or co-wrote include "[[Lady Friend (song)|Lady Friend]]", "[[Why (The Byrds song)|Why]]", and "[[Eight Miles High]]" with [[the Byrds]] and "[[Guinnevere]]", "[[Wooden Ships]]", "Shadow Captain", and "In My Dreams" with [[Crosby, Stills & Nash]]. He wrote "[[Almost Cut My Hair]]" and the title track "Déjà Vu" for [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]]'s 1970 album. He is known for his use of alternative guitar tunings and jazz influences. He has released six solo albums, five of which have charted. Additionally he formed a jazz-influenced trio with his son James Raymond and guitarist Jeff Pevar in [[CPR (band)|CPR]]. Crosby's work with the Byrds and CSN(Y) has sold over 35 million albums.<ref>{{cite web|title=RIAA - Soundscan|url=http://www.greasylake.org/the-circuit/index.php?/topic/106260-neil-young-bob-seger-and-crosby-stills-nash-youngusa-album-sales/|website=Greasylakes.org|access-date=December 23, 2015}}</ref>

Crosby has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice: once for his work in the Byrds and again for his work with CSN. Five albums to which he contributed are included in ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]], three with the Byrds and two with CSN(Y). He is outspoken politically and has been depicted as emblematic of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]].<ref>{{cite web | url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1987-08-16/entertainment/0140100281_1_david-crosby-crosby-spent-nash |title=Jail Term Allowed Crosby To Break Bond Of Drugs |last1=Harrington |first1=Richard |website=[[Orlando Sentinel]] |agency=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=May 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.davidcrosby.com/album/book/since-then |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120304182416/http://www.davidcrosby.com/album/book/since-then |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |title=Since Then: How I Survived Everything and Lived to Tell About It |last1=Crosby |first1=David |date=2012 |department= DavidCrosby.com |publisher=David Crosby |access-date=May 3, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.penguin.com/author/david-crosby/1000069064 | title = David Crosby-Bio |date=2014 |publisher=Penguin Group USA |access-date=May 3, 2014}}</ref>

==Early years==
David Van Cortlandt Crosby was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], second son of [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]-winning [[cinematographer]] [[Floyd Crosby]], who formerly worked on [[Wall Street]], and Aliph Van Cortlandt Whitehead, a salesperson at [[Macy's]] department store.<ref>Newsmakers: The People Behind Today's Headlines, issue 4, ed. Aaron J. Oppliger, Gale Research Group, 2000, p. 131</ref> His father was a relative of the [[Van Rensselaer (family)|Van Rensselaer family]], and his mother—granddaughter of [[Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh|Bishop of Pittsburgh]] [[Cortlandt Whitehead]]—descended from the prominent [[Van Cortlandt family]];<ref>"Aliph Whitehead Weds F.D. Crosby". ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 12, 1930.</ref> they "regularly inhabited the New York society pages before their wedding".<ref>CSNY: Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Peter Doggett, Atria Books (Simon & Schuster), 2019, p. 9</ref>

Crosby is the younger brother of musician Ethan Crosby. Growing up in California, he attended several schools, including the University Elementary School in Los Angeles, the [[Crane Country Day School]] in [[Montecito, California|Montecito]], and [[Laguna Blanca School]] in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] for the rest of his elementary school and junior high.<ref name="zimmer">{{cite book|author1=Zimmer, Dave |author2=[[Diltz, Henry]]|page=2|year=1984|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography |publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-17660-0}}</ref> At Crane, he starred in ''[[HMS Pinafore]]'' and other [[musicals]] but was asked not to return because of his lack of academic progress.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} Crosby did not graduate from the [[Cate School]] in [[Carpinteria, California|Carpinteria]].{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}  In 1960, his parents divorced, and his father married Betty Cormack Andrews.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

Crosby briefly studied drama at [[Santa Barbara City College]] before dropping out to pursue a career in music.<ref name="zimmer" /> He performed with singer [[Terry Callier]] in Chicago and [[Greenwich Village]], but the duo failed to obtain a recording contract.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://ancienttofuture.com/2012/10/30/extrordinary-joe-terry-callier-passes-to-other-side/|title=Extraordinary Joe: Terry Callier Passes To Other Side|date=October 30, 2012|access-date=October 30, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> He also performed with [[Les Baxter's Balladeers]] around 1962. With the help of producer Jim Dickson, Crosby recorded his first solo session in 1963.

==Musical career==
===The Byrds===
{{Main|The Byrds}}
Crosby arrived back in Chicago from New York City to hang out with [[Terry Callier]]. On tour and in Chicago at that time was [[Miriam Makeba]] and her band, who knew multi-instrumentalist Jim McGuinn. Callier introduced McGuinn to Crosby.<ref name=":0" /> Crosby joined Jim McGuinn (who later changed his name to [[Roger McGuinn|Roger]]) and [[Gene Clark]], who were then named the Jet Set. They were augmented by drummer [[Michael Clarke (musician)|Michael Clarke]], at which point Crosby attempted, unsuccessfully, to play bass. Late in 1964, [[Chris Hillman]] joined as bassist, and Crosby relieved Gene Clark of rhythm guitar duties. Through connections that Jim Dickson (the Byrds' manager) had with [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[Music publisher (popular music)|publisher]], the band obtained a [[Demo (music)|demo]] [[acetate disc]] of Dylan's "[[Mr. Tambourine Man]]" and recorded a version of the song, featuring McGuinn's [[12-string guitar]] as well as McGuinn, Crosby, and Clark's vocal harmonizing.<ref name="timeless">{{cite book|author=Rogan, J.|year=1998|title=The Byrds: Timeless Flight Revisited|publisher=Rogan House|isbn=0-9529540-1-X}}</ref> The song turned into a massive hit, reaching number one in the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom during 1965.<ref name="timeless" /> While McGuinn originated the Byrds' trademark 12-string guitar sound, Crosby was responsible for the soaring harmonies and often unusual phrasing of their songs, but whilst he did not sing lead vocals on either of the first two albums, he sang lead on the bridge in their second single "[[All I Really Want to Do]]".

In 1966, Gene Clark, who then was the band's primary songwriter, left the group because of stress and this placed all the group's songwriting responsibilities in the hands of McGuinn, Crosby, and Hillman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chrishillman.com/artist.html |title=The Artist |publisher=Chris Hillman |date=December 4, 1944 |access-date=October 20, 2011}}</ref> Crosby took the opportunity to hone his craft and soon became a relatively prolific songwriter, collaborating with McGuinn on the uptempo "I See You" (covered by [[Yes (band)|Yes]] on their [[Yes (Yes album)|1969 debut]]) and penning the ruminative "What's Happening". His early Byrds efforts also included the 1966 hit "[[Eight Miles High]]" (to which he contributed one line, while Clark and McGuinn wrote the rest), and its flip side "[[Why (The Byrds song)|Why]]", co-written with McGuinn.

Because Crosby felt responsible for and was widely credited with popularizing the song "[[Hey Joe]]",<ref name="timeless" /> he persuaded the other members of the Byrds to record it on ''[[Fifth Dimension (album)|Fifth Dimension]]''.  By ''[[Younger Than Yesterday]]'', the Byrds' 1967 album, Crosby began to find his trademark style on songs such as "Renaissance Fair" (co-written with McGuinn), "Mind Gardens" and "It Happens Each Day"; however, the latter song was omitted from the final album and ultimately restored as a bonus track on the 1996 remastered edition.<ref name="rogan">{{cite AV media notes|title=Younger Than Yesterday|others=[[The Byrds]]|year=1996|chapter=Song notes by Johnny Rogan|first=Johnny|last=Rogan|type=CD booklet|publisher=[[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/[[Legacy Recordings|Legacy]]}}</ref> The album also contained a rerecording of "Why" and "Everybody's Been Burned", a jazzy [[torch song]] from Crosby's pre-Byrds repertoire that was initially demoed in 1963.<ref name="timeless" />

Friction between Crosby and the other Byrds came to a head in mid 1967. Tensions were high after the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in June, when Crosby's onstage political diatribes (including a frank discussion of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories]]) between songs elicited rancor from McGuinn and Hillman. He further annoyed his bandmates when, at the invitation of [[Stephen Stills]], he substituted for an absent [[Neil Young]] during [[Buffalo Springfield]]'s set the following night. The internal conflict boiled over during the initial recording sessions for ''[[The Notorious Byrd Brothers]]'' (1968) that summer, where differences over song selections led to intra-band arguments. In particular, Crosby was adamant that the band should record only original material despite the recent commercial failure of "[[Lady Friend]]", a Crosby-penned single that stalled at No. 82 on the American charts following its release in July. McGuinn and Hillman dismissed Crosby in October after he refused to countenance the recording of a cover of [[Gerry Goffin|Goffin]] and [[Carole King|King]]'s "[[Goin' Back]]". While Crosby contributed to three compositions and five recordings on the final album, his controversial [[menage-a-trois]] ode "[[Triad (The Byrds song)|Triad]]" was omitted; [[Jefferson Airplane]] released a [[Grace Slick]]-sung cover on ''[[Crown of Creation]]'' (1968); three years later, Crosby released a solo acoustic version on Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young's double live album ''[[4 Way Street]]'' (1971); the Byrds' version appeared decades later on the 1988 ''[[Never Before (The Byrds album)|Never Before]]'' release and later on the CD re-release of ''The Notorious Byrd Brothers''.

In 1973, Crosby reunited with the original Byrds for the album ''[[Byrds (album)|Byrds]]'', with Crosby acting as the album's producer. The album charted well (at number 20, their best album showing since their second album) but was generally not perceived to be a critical success. It marked the final artistic collaboration of the original band.

===Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young===
{{Main|Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young}}
Around the time of Crosby's departure from the Byrds, he met a recently unemployed [[Stephen Stills]] at a party at the home of [[Cass Elliot]] (of [[the Mamas and the Papas]]) in California in March 1968, and the two started meeting informally and jamming together. They were soon joined by [[Graham Nash]], who would leave his commercially successful group [[the Hollies]] to play with Crosby and Stills. Their appearance at the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music and Art Fair]] in August 1969 constituted only their second live performance.

Their first album, ''[[Crosby, Stills & Nash (album)|Crosby, Stills & Nash]]'' (1969), was an immediate hit, spawning two [[Top 40]] hit singles and receiving key airplay on the new [[FM radio]] format, in its early days populated by unfettered [[disc jockeys]] who then had the option of playing entire albums at once.

The songs Crosby wrote while in CSN include "[[Guinnevere]]", "Almost Cut My Hair", "Long Time Gone", and "Delta". He also co-wrote "[[Wooden Ships]]" with [[Paul Kantner]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]] and Stephen Stills.

In 1969 Neil Young joined the group, and with him they recorded the album ''[[Déjà Vu (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|Déjà Vu]]'', which peaked at number 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[ARIA Charts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young - Chart history|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/299785/crosby-stills-nash-young/chart?f=305|website=Billboard.com|access-date=September 23, 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Australian Charts|url=http://www.australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Crosby,+Stills,+Nash+%26+Young&titel=Deja+vu&cat=a|access-date=September 23, 2017}}</ref> On September 30, 1969, Crosby's longtime girlfriend Christine Hinton was killed in a car accident only days after Hinton, Crosby, and Debbie Donovan moved from Los Angeles to the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. Crosby was devastated, and he began abusing drugs more severely than he had before. Nevertheless, he still managed to contribute "Almost Cut My Hair" and the title track, "Déjà Vu". After the release of the double [[live album]] ''[[4 Way Street]]'', the group went on a temporary hiatus to focus on their respective solo careers.

In December 1969, Crosby appeared with CSNY at the [[Altamont Free Concert]], increasing his visibility after also having performed at [[Monterey Pop Festival|Monterey Pop]] and [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]. At the beginning of 1970, he briefly joined with [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Phil Lesh]] and [[Mickey Hart]] from [[Grateful Dead]], billed as "David and the Dorks", and making a live recording at [[The Matrix (club)|the Matrix]] on December 15, 1970.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

[[File:CSNY 8-1974 (2).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Crosby in August 1974 with CSN]]
CSNY reunited in the summer of 1973 for unsuccessful recording sessions in [[Maui]] and [[Los Angeles]]. Despite lingering acrimony, they reconvened at a Stills concert at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] in [[San Francisco]] in October. This served as a prelude to their highly successful stadium tour in the summer of 1974. Following the tour, the foursome attempted once again to record a new album, provisionally entitled ''Human Highway''. The recording sessions, which took place at [[The Record Plant]] in [[Sausalito]], were very unpleasant, marked by constant bickering. The bickering eventually became too much, and the album was canceled.

In rehearsals for the 1974 tour, CSNY recorded a then-unreleased Crosby song, "Little Blind Fish". A different version of the song would appear on [[CPR (album)|the second CPR]] album more than two decades later. The 1974 tour was also affected by bickering, though they managed to finish it without interruption. A greatest hits compilation entitled ''[[So Far (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|So Far]]'' was released during 1974 to capitalize on the foursome's reunion tour.

In 1976, as separate duos, [[Crosby & Nash]] and [[Stills-Young Band|Stills & Young]] were both working on respective albums and contemplated retooling their work to produce a CSNY album. This attempt ended bitterly as Stills and Young deleted Crosby and Nash's vocals from their album ''[[Long May You Run]]''.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

CSNY did not perform together again as a foursome until [[Live Aid]] in Philadelphia in 1985, and then performed only sporadically in the 1980s and 1990s (mainly at the annual [[Bridge School Benefit]] organized by Young's wife Pegi). Without Young, however, Crosby, Stills & Nash has performed much more consistently since its reformation in 1977. The trio toured in support of their 1977 and 1982 albums ''[[CSN (album)|CSN]]'' and ''[[Daylight Again]]'' and then, starting in the late 1980s, has toured regularly year after year. The group continued to perform live, and since 1982 released four albums of new material: ''[[American Dream (Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young album)|American Dream]]'' (1988, with Young), ''[[Live It Up (Crosby, Stills & Nash album)|Live It Up]]'' (1990), ''[[After The Storm (CSN album)|After The Storm]]'' (1994), and ''[[Looking Forward]]'' (1999, with Young). In addition, Crosby & Nash released the self-titled album ''[[Crosby & Nash (album)|Crosby & Nash]]'' in 2004.

Full-scale CSNY tours took place in 2000, 2002, and 2006.

Crosby, Stills, and Nash appeared together on a 2008 episode of ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', and "Neil Young" joined them during the musical performance at the end of the episode. However, eventually, it became clear that it was only [[Stephen Colbert]] impersonating Young as the group sang "[[Teach Your Children]]".

Following a November 2015 interview in which he stated he still hoped the band had a future, Nash announced on March 6, 2016, that Crosby, Stills & Nash would never perform again because of his poor relations with Crosby.<ref>{{cite web|date=March 6, 2016|title=Graham Nash: 'Crosby, Stills & Nash is voorbij' / Graham Nash: 'Crosby, Stills & Nash is over'|work=Lust for Life|location=The Netherlands|issue=59|url=https://lflmagazine.nl/nieuws/graham-nash-crosby-stills-nash-is-voorbij|access-date=June 30, 2019|archive-date=April 11, 2016|archive-url=https://archive.today/20160411194915/http://lflmagazine.nl/nieuws/graham-nash-crosby-stills-nash-is-voorbij|language=nl|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Kielty |first=Martin |date=March 6, 2016 |title=Crosby, Stills And Nash are over says Graham Nash |website=LouderSound.com |url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/crosby-still-and-nash-are-over-says-graham-nash|access-date=August 28, 2016|archive-date= June 30, 2019|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190630180953/https://www.loudersound.com/news/crosby-still-and-nash-are-over-says-graham-nash|url-status=live}}</ref>

===1971–present: Solo career and Crosby & Nash===
In 1971, Crosby released his first solo album, ''[[If I Could Only Remember My Name]]'', featuring contributions by Nash, Young, [[Joni Mitchell]], and members of [[Jefferson Airplane]], the [[Grateful Dead]], and [[Carlos Santana|Santana]]. Panned on release by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', it has been reappraised amid the emergence of the [[freak folk]] and [[New Weird America]] movements and remains in print. In a 2010 list of the Best Albums published by the [[Vatican City]] newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', ''If I Could Only Remember My Name'' came in second to the Beatles', ''Revolver''.<ref name=GuardianVatican>Quinlan, Carrie (February 15, 2010).

[[File:David-Crosby 1976.jpg|thumb|Crosby on stage during a 1976 Crosby & Nash show at the [[Frost Amphitheater]], Stanford University]]
As a duo, Crosby & Nash (C&N) have released four studio albums and two live albums, including ''[[Another Stoney Evening]]'', which features the duo in a 1971 acoustic performance with no supporting band. Crosby songs recorded by C&N in the 1970s include "Whole Cloth", "Where Will I Be?", "Page 43", "Games", "The Wall Song", "Carry Me", "Bittersweet", "Naked in the Rain" (co-written with Nash), "Low Down Payment", "Homeward Through the Haze", "Time After Time", "Dancer", "Taken at All" (also co-written with Nash) and "Foolish Man". During the mid-1970s, Crosby and Nash enjoyed lucrative careers as session musicians, with both performers (as a duo and individually) contributing harmonies and background vocals to albums by Joni Mitchell, [[Jackson Browne]] (whom Crosby had initially championed as an emerging songwriter), [[Dave Mason]], [[Rick Roberts (musician)|Rick Roberts]], [[James Taylor]] (most notably "Lighthouse" and "Mexico"), [[Art Garfunkel]], [[J.D. Souther]], [[Carole King]], [[Elton John]], and [[Gary Wright]].

Renewing his ties to the San Francisco milieu that had abetted so well on his solo album, Crosby sang backup vocals on several Paul Kantner and Grace Slick albums from 1971 through 1974 and the [[Hot Tuna]] album ''Burgers'' in 1972. He also participated in composer [[Ned Lagin]]'s proto-[[Ambient music|ambient]] project ''[[Seastones]]'' along with members of the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Jefferson Starship]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Zimmer, Dave  |author2=Diltz, Henry.|page=179|year=1984|title=Crosby, Stills & Nash: The Authorized Biography|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-17660-0|edition=First}}</ref>

Crosby worked with [[Phil Collins]] occasionally from the late 1980s to the early 1990s. He sang backup to Collins in "[[That's Just the Way It Is]]" and "[[Another Day in Paradise]]", and, on his own 1993 song, "[[Hero (David Crosby song)|Hero]]", from his album ''[[Thousand Roads]]'', Collins sang backup. In 1992, Crosby sang backup on the album ''[[Rites of Passage (Indigo Girls album)|Rites of Passage]]'' with the [[Indigo Girls]] on tracks 2 and 12. In 1999, he appeared on ''[[Return of the Grievous Angel: A Tribute to Gram Parsons]]'', singing a duet of the title track with [[Lucinda Williams]].

In 2006, Crosby and Nash worked with [[David Gilmour]] as backing vocalists on the latter's third solo album, ''[[On an Island]]''. The album was released in March 2006 and reached number 1 on the UK charts. They also performed live with Gilmour in his concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in [[London]] in May 2006 and toured together in the United States, as can be seen on Gilmour's 2007 DVD ''[[Remember That Night]]''. They also sang backup on the title track of [[John Mayer]]'s 2012 album [[Born and Raised (John Mayer album)|''Born And Raised'']].

In January 2014, Crosby released his first solo album in 20 years, ''[[Croz]]'', recorded in close collaboration with his son James Raymond (of [[CPR (band)|CPR]]) at the latter's home studio.<ref name="billboard1">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5885459/david-crosby-croz-solo-album |title=David Crosby Amazed He Pulled Off 'Croz,' First Solo Album in 20 Years |magazine=Billboard |access-date=January 29, 2014}}</ref>

On July 14, 2016, Crosby announced a new solo album (his fifth) named ''[[Lighthouse (David Crosby album)|Lighthouse]]''  released on October 21, 2016, and shared (the same day) a new track from it titled "Things We Do For Love".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Ayers |first=Mike |date=July 14, 2016 |title=David Crosby Announces New Solo Album 'Lighthouse,' Shares New Track 'Things We Do For Love' (Exclusive) |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/14/david-crosby-announces-new-solo-album-lighthouse-shares-new-track-things-we-do-for-love-exclusive/ |access-date=August 28, 2016}}</ref> The album is a collaboration with [[Michael League]] of the [[big band]] [[Snarky Puppy]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Varga|first=George|title=David Crosby, at 74, aims to take the high road|date=March 20, 2016|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2016/mar/20/david-crosby-interview/|newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]]|access-date=April 5, 2016}}</ref>

===1996–2004: CPR===
{{Main|CPR (band)}}
In 1996, Crosby formed '''CPR''' or '''Crosby, Pevar & Raymond''' with session guitarist [[Jeff Pevar]], and pianist James Raymond, Crosby's son. The group released two studio albums and two live albums before disbanding in 2004.

The first song that Crosby and Raymond co-wrote, "Morrison", was performed live for the first time in January 1997. The song recalled Crosby's feelings about the portrayal of [[Jim Morrison]] in the movie ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]''. The success of the 1997 tour spawned a record project, ''[[Live at Cuesta College]]'', released in March 1998. There is a second CPR studio record, ''Just Like Gravity'', and another live recording, ''Live at the Wiltern'', recorded at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles, which also features [[Phil Collins]] and Graham Nash.

After the group split, Raymond has continued to perform with Crosby as part of the touring bands for C&N and CSN, as well as on solo Crosby projects, including 2014's ''[[Croz]]'' and the subsequent tour, for which he served as musical director. Jeff Pevar has toured with many artists over his productive career, including CSN, Ray Charles, Joe Cocker, Marc Cohn, Phil Lesh & Friends, Jazz Is Dead, Rickie Lee Jones, Jefferson Starship and Bette Midler. Pevar has a solo record, ''From the Core'', which was improvised and recorded in the Oregon Caves and features the vocalist from [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Jon Anderson]].

Crosby reunited with the other two members of CPR in 2018  as David Crosby & Friends, performing a series of shows in support of Crosby's new album ''Skytrails''.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ta2qny1Kbk | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/2ta2qny1Kbk| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title=David Crosby & Friends 'Angel Dream' 'Low Down Payment' |publisher=Seekmage |via=YouTube |date=May 20, 2017 |access-date=June 30, 2019}}{{cbignore}} David Crosby & Friends @ The Space 4/18/2017: James Raymond on keys, Mai Agan on bass, Steve DiStanislao on drums, Jeff Pevar on guitar and Michelle Willis on keys and vocals.</ref> During the global pandemic, Crosby also hosted a podcast for the Osiris music network.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.osirispod.com/podcasts/freak-flag-flying/|title = Freak Flag Flying}}</ref>

===David Crosby Cannabis brand===
Crosby, in partnership with longtime friend and entrepreneur Steven Sponder, developed a craft [[cannabis]] brand called "MIGHTY CROZ". Crosby, a 50+ year cannabis advocate and connoisseur credits cannabis with contributing to his creative process of songwriting stating "All those hit songs, every one of them, I wrote them all on cannabis." Crosby also credits cannabis and [[Cannabidiol]] (CBD) with alleviating his chronic shoulder pain allowing him to continue touring and making new music well into his seventies. Crosby and Sponder intend to work with licensed cultivators throughout the U.S. and beyond and will also extend the brand to include CBD and [[hemp]] products. In 2018, Crosby was invited to join the [[NORML]] National Advisory Board.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cannabisbusinesstimes.com/article/david-crosby-joins-norml-advisory-board/|title=Music Legend David Crosby Joins NORML Advisory Board|website=Cannabis Business Times}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hightimes.com/culture/david-crosby-talks-marijuana-his-upcoming-weed-brand-joni-mitchell/|title=David Crosby Talks Marijuana, His Upcoming Weed Brand & Joni Mitchell|last1=Blitchok|first1=Dustin|last2=Hasse|first2=Javier|date=August 9, 2018|website=High Times|language=en-US|access-date=October 8, 2018}}</ref>

Kennedy]] onstage during the Byrds' appearance at the Monterey Festival in 1967.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-rolling-stone-interview-david-crosby-19700723|title=David Crosby: The Rolling Stone Interview|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=July 23, 1970|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref> He identifies as a [[pacifist]] and was a well-known opponent over the US involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], though he has also defended the right to own guns.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/feb/26/david-crosby-new-album-croz|title=David Crosby : New Album, Croz|newspaper=The Guardian|date=February 26, 2014|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref>

Although Crosby was against [[Joe Biden]]'s candidacy during the 2020 presidential primaries, he voiced a more positive assessment following Biden's general election victory in November. Describing him as a "decent guy," Crosby noted that the personal tragedies Biden experienced with the tragic deaths of his first wife and daughter in 1972 and his oldest son, Beau, in 2015, made him a better human being. "He has humanity and he has compassion for other human beings because he's seen a lot of rough stuff himself. I don't generally trust most politicians but I trust [Biden] to be who he is and I think he's going to do a good job."<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/david-crosby-ask-croz-biden-1116889/|title=David Crosby Answers Your Questions on Parenting, Joe Biden and Fearing Death|date=January 21, 2021|magazine=Rolling Stone|access-date=July 1, 2021}}</ref>

===Drug, alcohol, and legal issues===
[[File:David Crosby 2012 1.jpg|thumb|Crosby performing in 2012 as part of Crosby, Stills & Nash]]

In 1985, after being convicted of several drugs and weapons offenses, Crosby spent nine months in a Texas state prison. The drug charges were related to [[Possession (law)|possession]] of [[heroin]] and [[cocaine]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/face-the-music-rock-star-mug-shots-20090611/face-the-music-musicians-behind-bars-david-crosby-51155147 |title=Rock Star Mug Shots|quote=David Crosby – Arrest Date: April 13, 1982.

Also in 1985, Crosby was arrested for drunken driving, a [[Hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] driving accident, and possession of a concealed pistol and drug paraphernalia. Crosby was arrested after driving into a fence in a Marin County suburb, where officers found a .45-caliber pistol and cocaine in his car.

On March 7, 2004, Crosby was charged with criminal possession of a weapon in the third degree, illegal possession of a hunting knife, illegal possession of ammunition, and illegal possession of about one ounce of marijuana. Crosby left said items behind in his New York City hotel room. Authorities said a "hotel employee searched the suitcase for identification and found about an ounce of marijuana, rolling papers, two knives and a .45-caliber pistol. Mr. Crosby was arrested when he returned to the hotel to pick up his bag." After spending 12 hours in jail, he was released on $3,500 bail. On July 4, 2004, he pleaded guilty in New York State Supreme Court to attempted criminal possession of a weapon and was fined $5,000 and given no jail time. Prosecutors did not seek a more severe penalty on the weapons charge because the pistol was registered in California and was stowed safely in his luggage when it was found. A charge of unlawful possession of marijuana was dismissed. Crosby was discharged by the court on condition that he pay his fine and not get arrested again.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/04/nyregion/david-crosby-fined-for-weapons-violation.html |title=David Crosby Fined for Weapons Violation|date=July 4, 2004|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>
