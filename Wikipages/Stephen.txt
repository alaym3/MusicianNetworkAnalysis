'''Stephen''' or '''Steven''' is a common English [[given name|first name]]. It is particularly significant to [[Christianity|Christians]], as it belonged to [[Saint Stephen]] ({{lang-grc-gre|Στέφανος}} {{lang|grc-Latn|Stéphanos}}), an early disciple and [[deacon]] who, according to the [[Book of Acts]], was stoned to death; he is widely regarded as the first [[martyr]] (or "[[protomartyr]]") of the [[Christian Church]]. The name "Stephen" (and its common variant "Steven")<ref>''Stephen'' was ranked 246th among male names in the United States in 2015, and 357th in England and Wales ([http://www.behindthename.com/name/stephen/top/united-states source]); ''Steven'' was ranked 154th in the United States and 403rd in England and Wales ([http://www.behindthename.com/name/steven/top/united-states source]). ''Stephen'', however, is the form more often used in historical contexts, and almost exclusively the form used for the saint.</ref> is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|grc|Στέφανος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|Stéphanos}}), a first name from the Greek word {{lang|grc|στέφανος}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|stéphanos}}), meaning 'wreath, crown' and by extension 'reward, honor, renown, fame', from the verb {{lang|grc|στέφειν}} ({{lang|grc-Latn|stéphein}}), 'to encircle, to wreathe'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Stephen&searchmode=none |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=2012-02-01}}</ref><ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dste%2Ffanos στέφανος], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref> In [[Ancient Greece]], crowning wreaths (such as [[laurel wreath]]s) were given to the winners of contests. Originally, as the verb suggests, the noun had a more general meaning of any "circle"—including a circle of people, a circling wall around a city, and, in its earliest recorded use, the circle of a fight, which is found in the [[Iliad]] of [[Homer]].<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?greek.display=UnicodeC&arabic.display=UnicodeC&language=original&navbar.display=show&doc=Hom.+Il.+13.736&fromdoc=null Homer, Iliad, 13.736], on Perseus</ref>

The name, in both the forms Stephen and Steven, is commonly shortened to '''Steve''' or '''Stevie'''. The spelling as '''Stephen''' can also be pronounced   {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|f|ə|n}} which is from the Greek Original version of '''Stephanos'''. In English, the female version of the name is "[[Stephanie]]". Many surnames are derived from the first name, including ''Stephens'', ''Stevens'', ''Stephenson'', and ''Stevenson'', all of which mean "Stephen's (son)". In modern times especially the name has sometimes been given with intentionally nonstandard spelling, such as '''Stevan''' or '''Stevon'''. A common variant of the name used in English is '''Stephan''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|f|ə|n}}; related names that have found some currency or significance in English include '''Stefan''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|f|ə|n}} or {{IPAc-en|s|t|ə|ˈ|f|ɑː|n}} in English), '''Esteban''' (often pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|s|t|ᵻ|ˌ|b|æ|n}}), and the [[Stephano (The Tempest)|Shakespeare]]an '''Stephano''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɛ|f|ə|n|oʊ}}.
