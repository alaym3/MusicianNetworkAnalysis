==Childhood and beginning==
Whittaker's parents, Edward and Vi Whittaker, were from [[Staffordshire]], England, where they owned and operated a grocery shop. His father was injured in a motorcycle accident and the family moved to a farm near [[Thika]], [[Kenya]], because of its warmer climate. His grandfather sang in various clubs and his father played the violin. Roger learned to play the guitar.

Upon completing his primary education, Whittaker was admitted to Prince of Wales School (now [[Nairobi School]]). Upon completing his high school education, he was [[conscription|called up]] for [[national service]] and spent two years in the [[Kenya Regiment]] fighting the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau]] in the [[Aberdare Range|Aberdare Forest]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/lifestyle/society/Through-thick-and-thin-the-Kenyan-spirit-remains/3405664-4244366-xg4f97z/index.html|title=Through thick and thin, the Kenyan spirit remains ever resilient|last=Kiereini|first=Douglas|date=28 December 2017|website=[[Business Daily Africa]]|publisher=[[Nation Media Group]]|access-date=28 December 2017}}</ref> In 1956 he was demobilized and decided on a career in medicine.

However, he left after 18 months and joined the civil service education department as a teacher, following in his mother's footsteps.<ref>{{cite web|author=William Ruhlmann |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/roger-whittaker-mn0000837084/biography |title=Roger Whittaker &#124; Biography & History |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=22 March 1936 |access-date=19 March 2017}}</ref>

==Recording and performing career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2016}}
To further his teaching career, Whittaker moved to Britain in September 1959.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=2678/9}}</ref> For the next three years, he studied [[zoology]], [[biochemistry]] and [[marine biology]] at [[Bangor University|University College of North Wales]] and earned a Bachelor of Science degree while singing in local clubs,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and released songs on [[Flexi disc]]s included with the campus newspaper, the ''Bangor University Rag''.

Shortly afterwards, he was signed to [[Fontana Records]],<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which released his first professional single, "The Charge of the Light Brigade", in 1962. (On the labels of the Fontana singles, he is billed as "Rog Whittaker".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/bigartist/roger-whittaker/all|title=Roger Whittaker Discography All Countries – Gallery – 45cat|website=45cat.com|access-date=30 April 2017}}</ref>) In the summer of 1962, Whittaker performed in [[Portrush]], Northern Ireland. He achieved a breakthrough when he was signed to appear on an [[Ulster Television]] show called ''This and That''.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> His second single was a [[cover version]] of "Steel Men", released in June 1962.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

In 1966, Whittaker switched from Fontana to [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, and was billed as Roger Whittaker from this point forward. His fourth single for the imprint was "Durham Town (The Leavin')", which in 1969 became Whittaker's first UK Top 20 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Whittaker's US label, [[RCA Victor]], released the uptempo "New World in the Morning" in 1970, where it became a Top 20 hit in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's Easy Listening chart. That same year, his downbeat theme song "No Blade of Grass", written for the film adaptation [[No Blade of Grass|of the same name]] that was sung during both the opening and ending titles, became his first film credit.

In the early 1970s, Whittaker took interest in the [[Nordic countries]] when he recorded the single "Where the Angels Tread" ([[Änglamark]]en) to the music of [[Evert Taube]] in 1972. In 1974 he performed at the Finnish [[Eurovision]] qualifications.<ref>{{cite web |title=TV-arkiston viisut 2/2 |url=http://vintti.yle.fi/yle.fi/teema/ohjelmat/juttuarkisto/tv-arkiston-viisut-224072.html?kommentoi |publisher=Suomen yleisradio |access-date=31 August 2021 |language=Finnish}}</ref> The song "The Finnish Whistler" he performed became famous in Finland as it was used as a title music for the popular Finnish [[Yle]] television cooking programme ''Patakakkonen''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5888038/|title=Patakakkonen|access-date=18 October 2021|website=IMDb.com}}</ref>

In 1975, EMI released "[[The Last Farewell]]", a track from his 1971 ''New World in the Morning'' album.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> It became his biggest hit and a signature song, selling more than 11 million copies worldwide.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1979, Whittaker wrote the song "Call My Name" which reached the final of the UK [[Eurovision]] selection, ''[[A Song For Europe]]'', performed by Eleanor Keenan and coming third. Whittaker recorded the song himself and the single charted in several European countries. He established himself in country music with "[[I Love You Because (song)|I Love You Because]]" getting "into the lower reaches of the [[country music|country]] chart"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/az/whittaker_roger/bio.jhtml|title=Roger Whittaker-Biography|website=Cmt.com|date=22 March 1936|access-date=18 November 2011}}</ref> in late 1983.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Whittaker had success in Germany, with German language songs produced by Nick Munro.

He appeared on German and Danish TV several times, and was on the UK ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' show ten times in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}} Whittaker's German-language songs were not initially well received by the critics, who derided the songs as "meaningless folk music". Notwithstanding, Whittaker released 25 albums in Germany and managed to grow a considerable fan base within the country, where he feels he has his most loyal fans, saying "The past few decades have been wonderful … My relationship with the German fans is great."<ref>{{cite news|last=Glaubitz|first=Sabine|title=Roger Whittaker: Die letzten Jahrzehnte waren wunderbar|newspaper=Berliner Morgenpost|location=Berlin|language=de|date=22 March 2016|url=https://www.morgenpost.de/vermischtes/stars-und-promis/article207257571/Roger-Whittaker-Die-letzten-Jahrzehnte-waren-wunderbar.html|access-date=8 December 2016}}</ref>

In March 2006, Whittaker announced on his website that a 2007 Germany tour would be his last, and that he would limit future performances to "occasional concerts". Now more fluent in German, he was seen singing and was interviewed in German on Danish TV in November 2008. In a 2014 interview, Whittaker reiterated that he had retired from touring in 2013, but claimed that he had written 18 new songs for an album and said "I still whistle very well".<ref name="express1">{{cite web|last=Robertson|first=Peter|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/473388/Roger-Whittaker-singer-of-Durham-Town |title=What happened to Roger Whittaker singer of Durham Town and The Last Farewell|website=Express.co.uk|date=3 May 2014|access-date=7 September 2015}}</ref>
