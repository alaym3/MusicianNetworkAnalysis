The group is composed of Jamie Jones, Delious Kennedy, Alfred Nevarez, and Tony Borowiak, all from the [[Antelope Valley, California|Antelope Valley]] and [[Mojave, California]] areas. The group has sold 69 million records worldwide.

==History==
All-4-One's hit "[[I Swear (John Michael Montgomery song)#All-4-One version|I Swear]]" won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1995 for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]] and enjoyed an eleven-week run at Number One on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], as well as a six-week run at Number One on the [[ARIA Charts|Australian Singles Chart]] and a seven-week run at No. 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Other [[RIAA]] Gold-certified hits by the group include remakes of "[[So Much in Love]]" (1993), "[[I Can Love You Like That#All-4-One version|I Can Love You Like That]]" (1995), and "[[Someday (Disney song)|Someday]]" from the soundtrack to Disney's 1996 animated film ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=All+4+One#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA |website=RIAA.com |access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>

A rift between their independent label, Blitzz Records, and their major label, Atlantic Records, led to the group leaving [[Atlantic Records]] as well as Blitzz Records after the release of the album ''On and On'' in 1999. The shift in labels left the group in limbo for a few years as they contemplated their next move. In 2001, the follow-up album, ''A41'', was released on AMC Records, yielding "Beautiful as U", a top 20 hit on the ''Radio & Records'' Adult Contemporary chart. The group's 2004 album, ''[[Split Personality (All-4-One album)|Split Personality]]'', was given an Asia-only release, and subsequently gave them Asian hits with "Someone Who Lives in Your Heart" and "I Just Wanna Be Your Everything". For much of the 2000s All-4-One spent their time touring Asia, in cities such as Tokyo, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Seoul, Bangkok, Shanghai and Sydney.

In 2009, All-4-One released ''[[No Regrets (All-4-One album)|No Regrets]]'' on the Peak Records/Concord Music Group label. The album was largely created in-house, with the group doing the writing for the album, and Jamie Jones production company, The Heavyweights, doing a lot of the production work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rnbhaven.com/90s-music/feature/All-4-One-Interview/28/1 |title=All-4-One Returns to R&B With No Regrets - R&B Haven |publisher=Rnbhaven.com |access-date=2012-06-11}}</ref> The CD produced the Urban Adult Contemporary hit "My Child".
