==History==
===Videos===
====checkgate====
On September 1, 2006, Cocomelon was created on YouTube to provide viewers with free education. Then known as checkgate,<ref>[https://youtube.com/user/checkgate Cocomelon - Nursery Rhymes - YouTube<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> the channel uploaded two versions of the [[alphabet song]] to YouTube on their first day.<ref name="coco_Abou">{{Cite web| title = About Us| work = cocomelon.com| access-date = 27 December 2019| url = https://www.cocomelon.com/aboutus| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201128124051/https://www.cocomelon.com/aboutus| archive-date = November 28, 2020}} </ref> The channel uploaded their third video 9 months later, titled "Learning ABC Alphabet – Letter "K" &mdash; Kangaroo Game". Most videos on the channel taught the alphabet with a typical length of between one and two minutes.

====ABC Kid TV====
In 2013, the ABC Kid TV era introduced a new intro and logo. The logo showed a TV with a ladybug on the upper left corner. The channel began remastering older videos followed by a transition from alphabet videos to [[nursery rhyme]]s and longer video lengths.  Within a few years the channel introduced computer animation, with their first 3D character being used in ''[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]'' on April 8, 2016. The video featured a 3D flying star guiding 2D characters through the sky. Towards the end of 2016, 3D animation video uploads became more frequent and longer, with some videos using motion capture technology. Animation and music production continued to modernize, and a recurring cast of characters formed, with J. J., TomTom, YoYo and many others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} 

====Present day====
In Summer 2018, the company rebranded again to Cocomelon, introducing a new [[intro (music)|intro]] and [[outro (music)|outro]] to all their videos.
