Speaking about the band's third album, ''Culture Scars'', guitarist Shane Gann said "Culture Scars is a term we came up with to refer to those scars, both physical and emotional, that come about due to certain things that society deems as normal and acceptable. We don’t normally put much thought into the amount of pain that may be caused by dirty politics, found within a family with a 'problem child', or existing behind the scenes of an adult entertainment shoot. These themes are so commonplace in the world, and yet there is often so much trauma and hurt that is brought about by all these scenarios. We wanted to shed some light on the darker side of what we think of as normalcy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.equalvision.com/news/hail-the-sun-to-release-culture-scars-on-june-17|title=HAIL THE SUN TO RELEASE 'CULTURE SCARS' ON JUNE 17 - Equal Vision Records|website=Equalvision.com|accessdate=June 13, 2017}}</ref>
