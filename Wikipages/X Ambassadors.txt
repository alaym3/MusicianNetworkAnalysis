''The Beautiful Liar'' is a [[concept album]] that plays out similarly to a radio drama, which expresses themes of insanity, powerlessness, self-doubt, and anxiety.<ref>{{Cite web|title=X-Ambassadors lose their minds as they strive to reclaim success on 'The Beautiful Liar'|url=https://www.cavalierdaily.com/article/2021/10/x-ambassadors-lose-their-minds-as-they-strive-to-reclaim-success-on-the-beautiful-liar|access-date=2021-10-02|website=The Cavalier Daily - University of Virginia's Student Newspaper}}</ref> It tells the story of a blind little girl whose shadow comes to life. It has an edgier, heavily trap-influenced sound, a major contrast from the band's previous releases, and tells its story over the course of 16 tracks. Sam and Casey said that the album was influenced from radio shows that they would listen to as children, which they would listen to instead of watching TV because Casey is blind. Sam said that for the album "(he) wanted to make an album that felt as unhinged as I did, and as the whole world felt around me," says Sam. "So Adam, Casey and I carved ourselves a space where we could all be as ugly, weird, funny, and f'd up as we wanted to be."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Paul|first=Larisha|date=2021-09-24|title=X Ambassadors Share New Album 'The Beautiful Liar' {{!}} uDiscover|url=https://www.udiscovermusic.com/news/x-ambassadors-the-beautiful-liar-album-release/|access-date=2021-10-02|website=uDiscover Music|language=en-US}}</ref>
