'''Twila Paris''' (born December 28, 1958, in Fort Worth, Texas) is a [[contemporary Christian music]] singer, songwriter, author and pianist. Since 1980, Paris has released 22 albums, amassed 33 number one Christian Radio singles, and was named the Gospel Music Association Female Vocalist of the Year three years in a row. Many of her earlier songs such as "He Is Exalted", "We Will Glorify", "Lamb of God", and "We Bow Down", are found in church hymnals or otherwise sung in church settings.  She was inducted into the Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame in May 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gmahalloffame.org/inductees-archive/|title=Inductees Archive|work=GMA Hall of Fame}}</ref>

==Career==
As a child she released her first album, ''Little Twila Paris'', in 1965. The album included songs drawn from among those she sang with her family in their evangelistic outreaches.

Paris released her first full-length album, ''Knowin' You're Around'', in 1981, and along the way she has written books, recorded children's music, and created worship songs.

In the 1980s and 1990s, Paris released mainly contemporary Christian pop songs. But in recent years, she has focused on recording new versions of some of her worship standards and writing new praise and worship music. Her 2005 album ''He Is Exalted: Live Worship'' collects a number of favorite songs commonly used in praise and worship of Paris's and presents them in a more typical style of live [[worship music]]. After her song "He Is Exalted" was used in churches in Brazil, Paris re-recorded it in the Portuguese translation they were using. This version appears on her 1992 album ''Sanctuary''. ''Sanctuary'' won the GMA Praise & Worship Album of the Year, and in 1995, her song "God Is In Control" won a GMA Song of the Year award. She has won five GMA Dove Awards and three American Songwriter Awards.

Although associated for much of her career with [[Star Song Communications]], EMI switched her to [[Sparrow Records]] in 1996, before her contract ended after 2003. In 2005, she switched to the praise and worship label Integrity Music for ''He Is Exalted: Live Worship''.

Paris released ''Small Sacrifice'' on December 26, 2007, which was available only through her Web site and at Lifeway Christian Stores. This album married the two parts of her career by including both inspirational pop/adult contemporary songs and original praise and worship compositions. Her first radio single from ''Small Sacrifice'' was "Live to Praise". ''Small Sacrifice'' was released for wider distribution by Koch Records on February 24, 2009.

In 2012, Paris released a patriotic-themed project that includes two new cuts ("God of Our Fathers" and "[[America the Beautiful]]") and ten cuts that Paris hand-picked from other projects. The purpose of the project is to inspire patriots with themes of God's protection and love, even in difficult times.

From 2011 to 2012, Paris was part of the Christian Classics Tour, joining artists [[Steve Green (singer)|Steve Green]], [[Wayne Watson]], [[Larnelle Harris]] and [[Michael Card]].<ref>{{cite press release |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=The Christian Classic Tour |url=http://www.christiannewswire.com/news/3474619145.html |location=Vancouver, Washington |agency=Christian Newswire |date=2012-03-08 |access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>

==Legacy==

==Personal life==
Twila Paris is the daughter of Oren Paris II, the son of travelling late 19th and early 20th century street preachers and his wife Rachel Inez Paris. In the late 1970s, Oren Paris II founded a [[Youth With A Mission]] (YWAM) base in Elm Springs, Arkansas. Oren II is the cousin of YWAM founder, [[Loren Cunningham]].
