'''Robyn Rowan Hitchcock''' (born 3 March 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano, and bass guitar. After leading [[the Soft Boys]] in the late 1970s and releasing the influential ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]'',<ref name="Holdship">{{cite journal |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thesoftboys/albums/album/115702/review/5940470/underwater_moonlight |title=The Soft Boys: ''Underwater Moonlight'' |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=13 March 2001 |access-date=15 February 2015 |last=Holdship |first=Bill |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071002074017/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thesoftboys/albums/album/115702/review/5940470/underwater_moonlight |archive-date=2 October 2007}}</ref> Hitchcock launched a prolific solo career. His musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by [[Bob Dylan]], [[John Lennon]], [[Syd Barrett]], [[Captain Beefheart]], [[Martin Carthy]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Roger McGuinn]] and [[Bryan Ferry]]. 

Hitchcock's earliest lyrics mined a rich vein of English surrealist comic tradition and tended to depict a particular type of eccentric and sardonic English worldview. His music and performance style was originally (and remains) heavily influenced by Bob Dylan, but also by the [[English folk music]] revival of the 1960s and early 1970s, and this was soon filtered through a then-unfashionable [[psychedelic rock]] lens during the [[punk rock]] and [[New Wave music]] eras of the late 1970s and early 1980s.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} This combination of musical styles won Hitchcock's band of the time, [[The Soft Boys]], a very enthusiastic if small fanbase, but an extremely frosty critical reception from the UK music press of the era.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} However, the Soft Boys' final album together, ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]'', posthumously earned them a glowing reputation (particularly in America) as a major influence on bands like [[R.E.M.]].{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}

After finding a measure of success in the latter 1980s in America, Hitchcock's lyrical and musical horizons broadened further to encompass a range of approaches while still retaining a recognisably surreal, but more serious, signature style. He has recorded for two major American labels ([[A&M Records]], then [[Warner Bros.]]) over the course of the 1980s and 1990s, and was the subject of a live performance/documentary film (''[[Storefront Hitchcock (film)|Storefront Hitchcock]]'') by major motion picture director [[Jonathan Demme]] in 1998. Since the turn of the millennium he has also finally received belated critical recognition in his home country. Despite this, mainstream success remains limited. He continues to tour and record prolifically and has earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances, and a dedicated "cult following"<ref name=Trager1997>{{cite book |last=Trager |first=Oliver |title=The American Book of the Dead |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TbRsHp57CqwC&pg=PA64 |date=4 December 1997 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=978-0-684-81402-5 |page=64 |quote=Hitchcock developed a sizable cult following on the heels of the critical acclaim he received in the mid-1980s for his highly poetic, if somewhat obscure, songs.}}</ref> for his unique body of work.

===Reunions and solo career, 1994–2006===
{{More citations needed section|date=August 2020}}
Early in 1994, after disbanding the Egyptians, Hitchcock embarked on a short reunion tour with the Soft Boys. His work received a slight boost in 1995 when his back catalogue (including both solo releases and Egyptians albums) were re-packaged and re-issued in the United States by the respected [[Rhino Records]] label. For the rest of the decade he continued recording and performing as a solo artist, releasing several albums on [[Warner Brothers]] Records, such as 1996's ''[[Moss Elixir]]'' (which featured the contributions of violinist [[Deni Bonet]] and guitarist [[Tim Keegan]]), and [[Storefront Hitchcock (soundtrack)|the soundtrack]] from the [[Jonathan Demme]]-directed concert film ''[[Storefront Hitchcock]]'' in 1998. The 1999 release ''[[Jewels for Sophia]]'', also on Warner, featured cameos from Southern California-based musicians [[Jon Brion]] and [[Grant-Lee Phillips]], both of whom often shared the stage with Hitchcock when he played Los Angeles nightclub [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]]. An album of outtakes from the Sophia sessions called ''[[A Star for Bram]]'', released on Hitchcock's own label, followed, and his subsequent albums appeared on a variety of independent labels.

In 2000 the Italian music writer [[Luca Ferrari (writer)|Luca Ferrari]] released a long interview with Hitchcock, ''A Middle Class Hero'' (Stampa Alternativa), in the form of a 96-page booklet in English and Italian accompanying a three-song CD of unreleased tracks.

In 2001 Hitchcock reunited and toured with [[Kimberley Rew]], bassist [[Matthew Seligman]], and Morris Windsor for the Soft Boys' re-release of their best-known album, 1980's ''[[Underwater Moonlight]]''. The following year they recorded and released a new album, ''Nextdoorland'', which was accompanied by a short album of outtakes, ''Side Three''. The reunion was short-lived.

The 2002 double album ''[[Robyn Sings]]'' comprised [[cover version]]s of [[Bob Dylan]] songs, including a live re-creation (performed in 1996) of Dylan's so-called ''Live at the Royal Albert Hall'' 1966 concert. Hitchcock celebrated his 50th birthday in 2003 with a concert at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London at which his then-new solo acoustic album ''[[Luxor (album)|Luxor]]'' was given away as a gift to all those attending, and an original poem of his was read by actor [[Alan Rickman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robynhitchcock.com/ |title=Robyn Hitchcock |publisher=Robyn Hitchcock |date=11 June 2012 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> He continued collaborating with a series of different musicians, as on the album ''[[Spooked (album)|Spooked]]'', which was recorded with country/folk duo (and longtime Hitchcock fans) [[Gillian Welch]] and [[David Rawlings]]. The Soft Boys re-formed again in 2006 to perform a live concert of [[Syd Barrett]]-era [[Pink Floyd]] covers in London, benefiting [[Médecins Sans Frontières]].

===The Venus 3 to present===
{{anchor|The Venus 3}}
[[File:Robyn Hitchcock 2010 by John Stephen Dwyer.jpg|upright|thumb|Hitchcock at [[Coolidge Corner Theatre]] in 2010]]

In 2006 ''[[Olé! Tarantula]]'' was released with the Venus 3, a band which consisted of longtime friends and collaborators [[R.E.M.]]'s [[Peter Buck]] and [[Young Fresh Fellows]]' frontman [[Scott McCaughey]], as well as [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]]'s [[Bill Rieflin]] (by then also R.E.M.'s full-time drummer). The song "'Cause It's Love (Saint Parallelogram)" was written with [[Andy Partridge]] of [[XTC]].

In 2007, he was the subject of a documentary ''[[Robyn Hitchcock: Sex, Food, Death... and Insects]]'' directed by John Edginton,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.otmoorproductions.com/dvds/robyn-hitchcock-sex-food-death%E2%80%A6and-insects/ |title=Robyn Hitchcock: Sex, Food, Death…and Insects &#124; Otmoor Productions &#124; Documentaries and Consultancy |publisher=Otmoor Productions |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> shown on the U.S. Sundance Channel and in the UK on BBC Four (and later released on DVD). "Food, sex and death are all corridors to life if you like. You need sex to get you here, you need food to keep you here and you need death to get you out and they’re the entry and exit signs."
 
The filmmaker eavesdrops on Hitchcock at work on his latest collection of songs with contributors including [[Nick Lowe]], former [[Led Zeppelin]] bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]], [[Peter Buck]] and [[Gillian Welch]]. The film culminates with Hitchcock and the band taking the songs on the road in America. A live EP with The Venus 3, ''[[Sex, Food, Death... and Tarantulas]]'', was released in conjunction with the documentary. The film also includes candid interviews with Hitchcock, who reveals much about the source of his work: "At heart I'm a frightened angry person. That's probably why my stuff isn't totally insubstantial. I'm constantly, deep down inside, in a kind of rage."

Late in 2007, Hitchcock's music was again re-packaged and re-released in the U.S., as [[Yep Roc Records]] began an extensive reissue campaign with three early solo releases and a double-CD compilation of rarities, which would be available separately or as part of a new boxed set release, ''[[I Wanna Go Backwards]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matt LeMay |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10945-i-wanna-go-backwards/ |title=Robyn Hitchcock: I Wanna Go Backwards Album Review |publisher=Pitchfork |date=30 November 2007 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref>

In 2008, that boxed set was followed up with ''[[Luminous Groove]]'', a boxed set of three early Egyptians releases and two further discs of rarities. In 2009, the electro-pop artist and remixer [[Pocket (musician)|Pocket]] released an EP featuring Hitchcock called "Surround Him With Love", while Hitchcock released an entirely separate new album, ''[[Goodnight Oslo]]'', with the Venus 3. At the end of the year, a live album called ''[[I Often Dream of Trains in New York]]'' documented the late-2008 onstage re-creation of his acclaimed 1984 acoustic album (a limited-edition deluxe version also included the materials to construct a kind of moving-image generator called a [[phenakistoscope]]).

In 2009, Hitchcock contributed to [[The Decemberists]]' [[concept album]] ''[[The Hazards of Love]]'', performing the short instrumental solo "An Interlude." Also in 2009, Hitchcock provided the score for the film ''Women in Trouble'', a feminist/exploitation "chick flick".

Concurrent with the redesign of his official website in early 2010, Hitchcock began to offer a series of "Phantom 45s" as downloads, each "45" being two newly recorded songs that would initially be offered as a free download. He also released the ''[[Propellor Time]]'' album, containing new material partially based on the "Sex, Food, Death" sessions shown in the 2007 documentary, but mainly featuring the Venus 3. In 2011, he released ''[[Tromsø, Kaptein]]'', an album of songs written in Norway, and released physically only in that country. Hitchcock was chosen by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] to perform "I Often Dream of Trains" at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival, to be curated by Mangum in March 2012 in Minehead, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php |title=ATP curated by Jeff Mangum |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=22 March 2012}}</ref> The album ''[[Love From London]]'' (working title: File Under Pop) was released on [[Yep Roc Records]] on 5 March 2013. The label also released his subsequent record, ''[[The Man Upstairs (Robyn Hitchcock album)|The Man Upstairs]]'', on 26 August 2014.

April 2015 saw Robyn Hitchcock team up with [[Emma Swift]] to release a limited Record Store Day 7" single "Follow Your Money," backed with a stripped back cover of [[Neil Young]]'s "Motion Pictures."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Robyn-Hitchcock-Emma-Swift-Follow-Your-Money/release/6913941 |title=Robyn Hitchcock, Emma Swift – Follow Your Money (Vinyl) |website=Discogs.com |date=2015-04-18 |access-date=2017-06-07}}</ref> The pair subsequently toured, releasing another 7" single double A side with the songs "Love Is A Drag" and "Life Is Change," produced by [[Teenage Fanclub]]'s [[Norman Blake (Scottish musician)|Norman Blake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Robyn-Hitchcock-Emma-Swift-Love-Is-a-Drag/master/1090673 |title=Robyn Hitchcock & Emma Swift – Love Is a Drag |website=Discogs.com |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref>

In 2017, Hitchcock released his eponymous album ''[[Robyn Hitchcock (2017 album)|Robyn Hitchcock]]''.<ref name="discogs1">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Robyn-Hitchcock-Robyn-Hitchcock/master/1167039 |title=Robyn Hitchcock – Robyn Hitchcock |website=Discogs.com |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> Working with [[Brendan Benson]] as co-producer, the album saw a return to a full band sound after his previous release, with guest appearances from [[Gillian Welch]] and [[Emma Swift]].

Hitchcock wrote the song "Sunday Never Comes" for the 2018 film ''[[Juliet, Naked (film)|Juliet, Naked]]'', which was sung in the movie by [[Ethan Hawke]]'s character, an aging, reclusive musician.<ref name=LATimes>{{cite news |last=Olsen |first=Mark |title=How the 'Juliet, Naked' team created a lost great album with help from Ryan Adams, Robyn Hitchcock and more |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-juliet-naked-music-20180817-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |location=[[Los Angeles]] |access-date=2020-08-11 }}</ref> He later released a companion video of his own version of the song.<ref name=Grammys2019>{{cite news |last=Hertweck |first=Nate |date=2019-12-08 |title= Robyn Hitchcock On Nashville Living, His 'Planet England' EP, John Lennon's Legacy & Making "Beatles Music" |url= https://www.grammy.com/grammys/news/robyn-hitchcock-nashville-living-his-planet-england-ep-john-lennons-legacy-making |work=Grammys.com |access-date=2020-08-11 }}</ref>

In September 2019 Hitchcock collaborated with [[XTC]] frontman [[Andy Partridge]] on a four-song EP ''[[Planet England]]'', co-writing the songs and both singing.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2053602/andy-partridge-robyn-hitchcock-collaborative-ep-planet-england/news/ |title=Andy Partridge & Robyn Hitchcock Announce Collaborative EP Out Next Month |last=Gray |first=Julia |website=Stereogum |date=4 August 2019  |access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=Grammys2019/>

Hitchcock was born in [[Paddington]], London, England, son of novelist [[Raymond Hitchcock (author)|Raymond Hitchcock]] (writer of ''[[Percy (1971 film)|Percy]]'').<ref>Harris, W. "[http://www.bullz-eye.com/music/interviews/2006/robyn_hitchcock.htm A chat with Robyn Hitchcock]," Bullz-eye.com, 10 February 2006. Retrieved 9 February 2013.</ref>

Hitchcock writes short stories, paints (often in a whimsical, [[surrealist]] style), and draws in a cartoon-strip style. His album covers often make use of his paintings or drawings, and the liner notes sometimes include a short story. His live concerts include story-telling, in the form of imaginative and surreal ad-libbed monologues in his lyrical style.

Hitchcock collaborated with director [[Jonathan Demme]] in 1998 for a live concert and film ''[[Storefront Hitchcock]]'', and later appeared in Demme's 2004 remake of ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 movie)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'', in which he played double agent Laurent Tokar. He also appeared in Demme's ''[[Rachel Getting Married]]'' in 2008, singing and playing guitar in the wedding-party band.

In September 2008 Hitchcock joined the Disko Bay Cape Farewell expedition to the West Coast of [[Greenland]]. [[Cape Farewell, UK|Cape Farewell]] is a UK-based arts organisation that brings artists, scientists and communicators together to instigate a cultural response to climate change. Other voyagers on the trip included musicians [[Feist (singer)|Feist]], [[Laurie Anderson]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[KT Tunstall]] and [[Martha Wainwright]].

In August 2015, Hitchcock moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Edd Hurt |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/features/article/20858682/robyn-hitchcock-reinvents-himself-in-nashville-but-the-stones-remain |title=Robyn Hitchcock Reinvents Himself in Nashville |publisher=Nashville Scene |date=20 April 2017 |access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref>
