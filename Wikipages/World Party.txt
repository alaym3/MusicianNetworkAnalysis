'''World Party''' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] musical group, which is essentially the solo project of its sole member, [[Karl Wallinger]]. He started the band in 1986 in [[London]] after leaving [[The Waterboys]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

==Career==
After a stint as musical director of a [[West End theatre|West End]] performance of ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'', Karl Wallinger joined a funk band called "The Out", before joining [[Mike Scott (Scottish musician)|Mike Scott]]'s [[Waterboys]] in 1984 to record the [[album]] ''[[A Pagan Place]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> After their third album in 1985, ''[[This Is the Sea]]'', Wallinger departed to form World Party.

Recorded at Wallinger's home in 1986, his debut album ''[[Private Revolution]]'' yielded two minor [[hit record|hits]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], "Private Revolution" and "[[Ship of Fools (World Party song)|Ship of Fools]]".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  "Ship of Fools", however, did much better outside the UK – it reached no. 4 in [[Australia]], no. 21 in New Zealand, and no. 27 in the [[United States|US]], in the process becoming the act's only major international hit.

Between World Party's first and second albums, Wallinger aided [[Sinéad O'Connor]] in recording her 1988 debut, ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]''.  O'Connor, then an unknown, had appeared as a guest on World Party's first album. She would go on to appear as a guest on the second LP as well.

[[Goodbye Jumbo]], World Party's second album, contained the minor UK hit singles "[[Way Down Now]]" and "Put the Message in the Box".<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Wallinger collaborated with fellow [[songwriter]] [[Guy Chambers]] on some of the tracks. ''Goodbye Jumbo'' was voted "album of the year" by ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for "best alternative music performance" in the US.

After the 1991 [[Extended play|EP]] ''Thank You World'', Wallinger recruited guitarist [[David Catlin-Birch]] and ex-Icicle Works drummer [[Chris Sharrock]] as fully-fledged members for 1993's album ''[[Bang! (World Party album)|Bang!]]''. It reached no. 2 in the [[UK Albums Chart]], with the track, "Is It Like Today?" (no. 19 on the [[UK Singles Chart]])<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> also becoming a moderately successful single in [[Europe]]. Following the success of ''Bang!'' World Party appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 1994, at which they had previously played in 1987 and 1990.

In 1994, World Party recorded "When You Come Back to Me" for the ''[[Reality Bites]]'' [[soundtrack]], influenced by [[David Bowie]]'s 1975 song "[[Young Americans (song)|Young Americans]]". Catlin-Birch left shortly afterwards.

Their fourth album, ''[[Egyptology (album)|Egyptology]]'' (1997), written following the death of Wallinger's mother, was commercially unsuccessful, although "[[She's the One (World Party song)|She's the One]]" won an [[Ivor Novello Award]] and was subsequently recorded by [[Robbie Williams]]. Sharrock left the group after the recording of this album, leaving Wallinger on his own. Wallinger took a three-year break from World Party, before the release of ''[[Dumbing Up]]'' in 2000. However, in February 2001 he suffered an [[aneurysm]] that left him unable to speak.

After a five-year rehabilitation, in 2006 Wallinger re-emerged onto the scene. With his back catalogue reclaimed from EMI, a distribution deal was agreed (via his own Seaview label) with Universal, and he played his first live show in a decade at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in Texas, US. He played additional US dates in 2006 including the Bonnaroo Festival in Tennessee. ''[[Big Blue Ball]]'', a joint project with [[Peter Gabriel]] with production work by [[Stephen Hague]] was also released.

In September 2007, World Party supported [[Steely Dan]] in their first tour of [[Australia]]. The ''Best in Show'' compilation was released to celebrate the Australian tour.

In 2009 World Party toured the west coast of the US, and appeared at Seattle's [[Bumbershoot]] Festival and San Francisco's [[Hardly Strictly Bluegrass]] Festival.

In 2012 World Party released a new five-CD/70-song collection of new songs, live recordings and cover versions titled ''Arkeology'' to critical acclaim. World Party toured extensively in America in 2012, and toured England for the first time in 12 years, ending with an appearance in November 2012 in London at the Royal Albert Hall.

Live dates and tours followed through 2015, and a 2013 UK show was issued as a 2-CD set called ''World Party – Live!''.  World Party has not toured, released new material, or updated their website since the end of their 2015 North American tour.
