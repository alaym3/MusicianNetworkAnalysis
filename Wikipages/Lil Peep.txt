His mixtapes ''[[Hellboy (Lil Peep mixtape)|Hellboy]]'' and ''Crybaby'', released on [[SoundCloud]], were on the front lines of hip-hop’s open-eared engagement with other genres, as well as documents of the ways emo and pop-punk had begun to make room for hip-hop.

In the livestream, he also implied that members of GothBoiClique were responsible for Lil Peep's death, saying, "Some of y'all are siding with the people that took advantage of Peep.
