'''Provoker''' are an American [[post-punk]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Provoker: The Best of What's Next|url=https://post-punk.com/darkwave-punks-provoker-unleash-their-video-for-since-then/|website=[[Post-Punk.com]]|access-date=17 August 2021 |date=16 April 2020}}</ref> band from [[The San Francisco Bay Area]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Russel|first1=Scott|title=Provoker: The Best of What's Next| url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/provoker/provoker-the-best-of-whats-next/|website=[[Paste Magazine]]|access-date=17 August 2021 |date=14 July 2021}}</ref>

Formed by Jonathan Lopez in 2015, Provoker began as a solo project, focused on creating scores for fictional horror films.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Provoker| url=https://goodalbumfriday.com/2019/11/11/provoker/|website=[[Good Album Friday]]|access-date=17 August 2021 |date=2019}}</ref> After coming in contact with singer-songwriter Christian Petty at a screening of the American black comedy [[The Greasy Strangler]], Lopez sent him some of his soundtrack pieces to record vocals over. This melding lead to the band adopting more post-punk influence, finding a middle ground between Lopez's synth driven experimentation and Petty's R&B influenced singing. 

The band was complete in its current form after the release of 2018's Dark Angel EP, now a four piece consisting of guitarist Lopez, bassist Wil Palacios, percussionist Kristian Moreno and vocalist Petty.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pessaro|first1=Fred|title=HEAR POST-PUNK CREW PROVOKER CHANNEL THE CURE, SISTERS OF MERCY ON NEW SONG| url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/hear-post-punk-crew-provoker-channel-cure-sisters-mercy-new-song|website=[[Revolver Mag]]|access-date=17 August 2021 |date=11 May 2018}}</ref>
