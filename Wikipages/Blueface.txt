== Career ==

=== 2017–2018: Viral success, ''Famous Cryp'', and "Bleed It" ===

Porter began rapping in January 2017 under the name '''Blueface Bleedem''', a reference to his ties to the School Yard [[Crips]] street gang. Originally moving back to Los Angeles after leaving [[Fayetteville State University]], he was invited to his friend Laudiano's music studio to retrieve a phone charger, and after being challenged to rap over a beat, Porter began to work to release his first song, "Deadlocs", produced by Laudiano, onto [[SoundCloud]].<ref name="laudiano">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/3108334/blueface-laudiano-producer-interview/|title=Blueface Is One Of 2019's Most Promising Stars â€" His Producer Tells Us How He Got Here|website=MTV News|access-date=2019-01-26}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> In June 2018, he released his first full-length project, ''[[Famous Cryp]]''. In September 2018, after the song and EP helped him build a local following in California, he released his second EP, ''Two Coccy'', onto SoundCloud and [[Spotify]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

On October 8, 2018, Blueface released a music video for his song, "Respect My Crypn", on [[WorldstarHipHop]]'s [[YouTube]] channel, and shortly after the song was posted to [[Twitter]], where it became a viral [[internet meme|meme]].<ref name="laudiano"/> The video's popularity led to more of Blueface's music receiving attention, with his songs "[[Thotiana]]" and "Next Big Thing" earning newfound popularity. His popularity increased even further after holding a contest on his [[Instagram]] stories and posts using polls to determine which high school he should visit, with [[Pasadena High School (California)|Pasadena High School]] edging out a victory over [[Santa Monica High School]]. The social media challenge brought in new followers, increasing his already growing popularity. In November 2018, Blueface was signed to [[Cash Money Records]]' [[West Coast hip-hop|West Coast]] affiliate [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money West]], and posted clips of himself in the studio with Canadian rapper [[Drake (musician)|Drake]] and [[Quavo]] on his Instagram page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2018/12/blueface-new-songs-drake-quavo/|title=Blueface Confirms New Songs With Drake and Quavo - XXL|first1=K.
