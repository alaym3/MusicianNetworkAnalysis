== Controversies ==

=== Fake views allegations ===
Aktaş's song "Ela" was released together with a music video on YouTube. The video initially received more likes and comparatively less views, which was pointed out by singer [[Işın Karaca]] who accused Aktaş of manipulating the YouTube system. Aktaş responded to the allegations and said "It is a good thing to be ignorant, you think you know everything. No, I'm sad, she actually believes what she has said. She even wrote it in English, what a pity". Also, in an answer to a question on Instagram he made an insulting reference to Karaca without mentioning her name.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.yenialanya.com/magazin/aleyna-dan-reynmen-e-olay-gonderme-h373560.html|title=Aleyna'dan Reynmen'e olay gönderme|access-date=12 February 2020|website=yenialanya.com|publisher=Yeni Alanya Gazetesi}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.ahaber.com.tr/galeri/magazin/reynmen-kendisini-elestiren-isin-karacaya-kufur-etti/4|title=Reynmen kendisini eleştiren Işın Karaca'ya küfür etti.|date=16 July 2019|publisher=[[A Haber]]}}</ref> [[Demet Akalın]] later liked a post 
that claimed the music video's number of views was fake and a fraud had taken place.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.takvim.com.tr/saklambac/2019/07/15/reynmene-rekor-tepkisi-aleyna-tilki-demet-aklalin-ve-isin-karaca-sosyal-medyadan-bombaladi|title=Reynmen'e rekor tepkisi! Aleyna Tilki, Demet Aklalın ve Işın Karaca sosyal medyadan bombaladı!|publisher=[[Takvim]]}}</ref>

[[Aleyna Tilki]] criticized Aktaş's assertion that "he was the first Turk to reach number one on the world music list". Tilki shared a tweet showing that her song "Nasılsın Aşkta" was the first Turkish song to rank first in the world music list and accused Aktaş of putting up a show.<ref name=":0" />

=== Adhan controversy ===
In [[Ramadan]] 2019, Aktaş shared a video of himself on social media in which he would start to recite ''[[adhan]]'' loudly close to people who were waiting for ''[[iftar]]'' and then laugh as they would actually believe it was the time for ''iftar''. The video went viral on social media and received criticism from various people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.haberturk.com/reynmen-e-ezan-tepkisi-reynmen-kimdir-2558945-magazin|title=Reynmen'e büyük tepki|access-date=12 February 2020|language=tr|website=[[Habertürk]]}}</ref>

In the television program ''Söylemezsem Olmaz'', the subject was taken on by the theologian Arif Arslan. Arslan reacted to the video and questioned Aktaş's actions: "Doesn't he have a mom or dad, did this child pop out of a stone hole?". Arslan also commented on the claim that Aktaş had made fun of the adhan and added that "He has committed [[apostasy]], he must repent". Aktaş made a statement on these comments through his social media accounts and referring to the program's presenters added that he would "bring them to account in court.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ulusal.com.tr/magazin/ilahiyatcidan-reynmen-aciklamasi-dinden-cikti-h248515.html|title=İlahiyatçıdan Reynmen açıklaması "Dinden çıktı"|access-date=12 February 2020|website=ulusal.com.tr|publisher=[[Ulusal Kanal]]}}</ref>
