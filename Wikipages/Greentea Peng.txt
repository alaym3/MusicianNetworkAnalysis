== Early life ==
Aria Wells was born in [[Bermondsey]], South London, to an Arab father, who was a trained actor, and African mother.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|date=2020-12-01|title=Greentea Peng’s Recipe For Revolution Is More Love, Less Ego|url=https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/greentea-peng-interview/|access-date=2021-03-05|website=Highsnobiety|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":6" /> Wells resided in London for the majority of her childhood. During this period, she absorbed musical influences from her father, who introduced her to theatre and taught her songs.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web|title=Interview: Greentea Peng keeps one foot off the ground|url=https://www.thelinkup.com/content/3279/exclusive-greentea-peng-keeps-one-foot-off-the-ground|access-date=2021-03-05|website=Link Up Tv|language=en}}</ref> Meanwhile, she partook in singing for school activities and community events, especially church choir.<ref name=":8">{{Cite news|last=Snow|first=Mat|date=2020|title=Strange Brew! The Trip-Hop Revival Starts with Greentea Peng|work=MOJO Magazine|url-status=live}}</ref>

At age 12, after her parents separated, she and her mother moved to [[Hastings]].<ref name=":3" /> Her mother refused to have her attend secondary school in South London given the schools were, according to Wells, "really bad at the time, all transitioning into academies and stuff".<ref name=":4" /> Wells often returned to London over the summer holidays, visiting her father. Between places, she continued pursuing music by writing her own music and doing performances.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|date=2019-01-17|title=How Greentea Peng found her guardian angel in Mexico|url=https://districtmagazine.ie/features/how-greentea-peng-found-her-guardian-angel-in-mexico/|access-date=2021-03-05|website=District Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":7" /> However, due to bullying, she lost her self-confidence and decided to stop making music by the age of 15.<ref name=":9" /><ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-10-24|title=New Noise: Greentea Peng {{!}} Wonderland Magazine|url=https://www.wonderlandmagazine.com/2018/10/24/new-noise-greentea-peng/|access-date=2021-03-06|website=Wonderland|language=en-US}}</ref> She also had passed her GSCE's early and eventually dropped out.<ref name=":8" />

Upon her return to London at 17, she worked at various bars and frequently partied.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=Greentea Peng|url=https://nataal.com/greentea-peng|access-date=2021-03-05|website=nataal.com|language=en-US}}</ref> One of the bars she worked at the longest was in the nightclub Visions, located in Dalston.<ref name=":4" /> Amid all this, Wells had been struggling with substance abuse.<ref name=":9" /> In an interview with ''District Magazine'', she recalled dealing with addiction to drugs, such as [[Xanax]], "for a long time, from a young age".<ref name=":9" />

== Career ==

=== 2011–2015: Travelling, recovery and return to music ===
Wells had plans to travel after saving enough money from bar-tending.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greentea Peng|url=https://www.bodeganottingham.com/gigs/greentea-peng/|access-date=2021-03-05|website=The Bodega|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":11">{{Cite web|date=2019-11-06|title=Greentea Peng Believes in Magic|url=https://acclaimmag.com/music/greentea-peng/|access-date=2021-03-05|website=Acclaim Magazine|language=en-us}}</ref> Together with her boyfriend at the time, she began making trips to California and Peru.<ref name=":11" /> Her stage name, Greentea Peng, emerged from a box of Green Tea Seng she bought at a Peruvian chemist.<ref name=":6" /> She added the UK slang term ‘peng’ (meaning ‘very attractive’ or ‘extremely good’) based on her regular usage of it and how she liked the design of the woman, donning a weed bikini, on the Green Tea Seng box.<ref name=":6" />

Wells' longest trip had been to Tulum, Mexico. She had a friend who resided there, who allowed her and her then-boyfriend to stay in their yard.<ref name=":11" /> After multiple jobs at different hotels, Wells then started working at a self-help yoga retreat, where she helped organize workshops and classes.<ref name=":11" /> Throughout her time there, despite being initially sceptical, she began to apply the retreat’s teachings to her own life. Wells soon gained the confidence again to pursue music again.<ref name=":11" /> Before she even started doing music again, she also became friends with her current manager, UK designer, visual artist, and musician KESH.<ref name=":11" /><ref name=":9" /> The two had met through a mutual friend at a beach.<ref name=":11" />

Wells performed the song "[[Smile (Lily Allen song)|Smile]]" by [[Lily Allen]] at an open mic.<ref name=":9" /> Afterwards, she was asked by a guitarist to join their band: Los Hedonistas.<ref name=":10" /><ref name=":9" /> When she started singing with the Los Hedonistas, they played numerous gigs covering songs.<ref name=":9" /> Wells had earned more money from performing, which she said was "1500 [pesos] a show", than her income from previous jobs.<ref name=":9" />

=== 2016–2019: ''Sensi'', ''Rising'' and rise to popularity ===
After staying in Mexico for six months, Wells returned to London.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web|date=2020-04-27|title=Greentea Peng|url=https://notion.online/greentea-peng-2/|access-date=2021-03-05|website=Notion|language=en-GB}}</ref> She soon met her producer, Earbuds, and both began developing her debut six-track EP Sensi.<ref name=":12" /> Majority of the tracks in Sensi focused on her breakup with an ex, as well as a gradual withdrawal from marijuana.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greentea Peng: Expression not Expectation|url=https://boilerroom.tv/article/greentea-peng-expression-not-expectation|access-date=2021-03-05|website=BOILER ROOM|language=en}}</ref> She also wanted Sensi to reflect the emotions she had been harbouring and suppressing, as she stated that she made "something that sounds beautiful but contains some of that stickiness too".<ref name=":4" />

Her debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''Sensi'', was released in October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greentea Peng's vibrant style is connected to her soulful sound|url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/aesthetic/aesthetic-greentea-peng/|access-date=2020-01-26|website=Crack Magazine}}</ref> Media figures noted the multiple genres incorporated within the record's sound, including R&B, [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[Dub music|dub reggae]].<ref name=":1" /> Soon after, Wells quickly started working on her next EP, Rising, again collaborating with Earbuds.<ref>{{Cite web|title=On the Rise: Greentea Peng|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/on-the-rise-greentea-peng|access-date=2021-03-05|website=The Line of Best Fit|language=en}}</ref> In an MTV interview, she recalled being at her studio for a month, where she "banged out 15 tunes".<ref name=":0" />

On 17 June 2019, Wells' live performance of her Owen Cutts produced single "Downers" was uploaded on the popular YouTube channel [[ColorsxStudios|COLORS]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Greentea Peng - Downers {{!}} A COLORS SHOW|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-QGBuGcGSY|language=en|access-date=2020-01-26}}</ref> Her performance had garnered her a bigger audience, as the video incurred 2.5 million in viewership by October.<ref name=":0" /> Following this success, her music video for the single "Mister Sun (miss da sun)" had premiered on her YouTube channel.<ref>{{Citation|title=Greentea Peng - Mr. Sun (miss da sun)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_DDqg1A8lw|language=en|access-date=2021-03-05}}</ref> Directed by Felix Brady, the video became distinctly known for its “dreamlike, kaleidoscopic visuals”, as Wells is depicted navigating through mirror portals into various environments.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Greentea Peng 'Mr Sun (miss da sun)' by Felix Brady {{!}} Videos {{!}} Promonews|url=https://www.promonews.tv/videos/2019/10/08/greentea-peng-mr-sun-miss-da-sun-felix-brady/61218|access-date=2021-03-05|website=Promonewstv|language=en}}</ref> Then, on 1 November 2019, her second EP, Rising, had finally come out.

Aside from music, she had partaken in promotional campaigns for a few clothing brands. In August 2019, she sported rainbow knitwear made by [https://www.ssense.com/en-us/women/designers/agr AGR] designer, Alicia Robinson, for the [[Notting Hill Carnival]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=SSENSE|date=2019-08-29|title=AGR Is Bringing Sweater Weather to Carnival|url=https://www.ssense.com/en-us/editorial/fashion/agr-is-bringing-sweater-weather-to-carnival|access-date=2021-03-05|website=ssense|language=en}}</ref> In October 2019 she was also part of a promotional campaign for the sportswear brand [[Adidas]], featuring poster advertisements and commissioned [[remix]] collaborations between up and coming artists from around the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=adidas and Foot Locker Connect with Europe's New Wave Hip-Hop Creators to Relaunch the Iconic CHILE 62 Tracksuit|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2019/10/adidas-foot-locker-chile-tracksuit|access-date=2020-01-26|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref>

In November 2020, her song "Revolution" came out as a response to the world events and social tensions that emerged during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref name=":5" /> UK musician Tadafi produced the beat for her years ago, but she decided to collaborate with him after he played it for her a second time upon meeting again.<ref name=":5" /> Lyrically, Wells wanted to encourage people to be wary of the causes they fight for.<ref name=":5" /> On 1 December, celebrating her birthday, she had the music video for another single “Spells” uploaded onto her YouTube channel.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Subscribe|title=Greentea Peng unveils new track 'Spells' {{!}} News|url=http://diymag.com/2020/12/01/watch-greentea-peng-spells-video|access-date=2021-03-05|website=diymag.com|language=en}}</ref>
