'''Patrick Charles Eugene Boone'''<ref>{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook|year=1959|publisher=The H.W. Wilson Company|location=New York City}}</ref> (born June 1, 1934) is an American singer, composer, actor, writer, television personality, motivational speaker, and spokesman. He was a successful pop singer in the United States during the 1950s and early 1960s. He sold more than 45 million records, had 38 Top 40 hits, and appeared in more than 12 Hollywood films.

According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Boone was the second-biggest charting artist of the late 1950s, behind only [[Elvis Presley]], and was ranked at No. 9 in its listing of the Top 100 Top 40 Artists 1955–1995.<ref>{{cite book|title=Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, The|year=1996|page=806|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|author=Joel Whitburn|author-link=Joel Whitburn}}</ref> Until the 2010s, Boone held the ''Billboard'' record for spending 220 consecutive weeks on the charts with one or more songs each week.

At the age of 23, he began hosting a half-hour [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] variety television series, ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'', which aired for 115 episodes (1957–1960). Many musical performers, including [[Edie Adams]], [[Andy Williams]], [[Pearl Bailey]], and [[Johnny Mathis]], made appearances on the show. His [[cover version]]s of [[rhythm and blues]] hits had a noticeable effect on the development of the broad popularity of [[rock and roll]]. Elvis Presley was the opening act for a 1955 Pat Boone show in [[Brooklyn, Ohio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/pat_boone_elvis_presley.shtml|title=Pat Boone Remembers Elvis Presley : Elvis Articles: Official Elvis Presley Fan Club : Elvis Australia : Pat Boone |website=Elvis.com.au|access-date=September 19, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928072111/http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/pat_boone_elvis_presley.shtml|archive-date=September 28, 2011}}</ref>

As an author, Boone had a number-one bestseller in the 1950s (''Twixt Twelve and Twenty'', Prentice-Hall). In the 1960s, he focused on [[gospel music]] and is a member of the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]]. He continues to perform and speak as a motivational speaker, a television personality, and a [[political conservative|conservative]] political commentator.

== Early life==
Boone was born on June 1, 1934, in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], the son of Margaret Virginia (née Pritchard) and Archie Altman Boone. He was raised in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where his family moved when he was two years old. Boone attended and graduated in 1952 from [[Lipscomb Academy|David Lipscomb High School]] in Nashville. His younger brother, whose professional name is [[Nick Todd]], was also a pop singer in the 1950s and is now a church music leader.<ref name="ParishPitts2003">{{cite book|last1=Parish|first1=James Robert|last2=Pitts|first2=Michael R.|title=Hollywood Songsters: Allyson to Funicello|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GlybVaD6cakC&pg=PA99|access-date=July 23, 2010|date=July 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-94332-1|page=99}}</ref>

In a 2007 interview on ''[[The 700 Club]]'', Boone claimed that he is the great-great-great-great grandson of the American pioneer [[Daniel Boone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/700club_patboone022007.aspx|title=BETWEEN THE LINER NOTES: Pat Boone and the New American Revolution|publisher=[[Christian Broadcasting Network]]|author1=Woodland, Shannon|author2=Ross, Scott|name-list-style=amp|access-date=May 7, 2007}}</ref>

== Career ==
=== Music ===
Boone began his career by performing in Nashville's [[Centennial Park (Nashville)|Centennial Park]].<ref name="kingsportevansmusiccity">{{cite news|last1=Evans|first1=Jim|title='Music City' Tour Set Up|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/75318152/?terms=%22centennial%2Bpark%22|access-date=April 22, 2017|work=The Kingsport Times|date=July 16, 1964|page=11|location=Kingsport, Tennessee|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|url-access=registration |quote=The folks are shown where Pat Boone attended school and told how Pat got his start with the Sunday concerts in Centennial Park}}</ref> He began recording in 1954 for Republic Records (not to be confused with [[Republic Records|the current label with that name]]), and by 1955, for [[Dot Records]]. His 1955 version of [[Fats Domino]]'s "[[Ain't That a Shame]]" was a hit. This set the stage for the early part of Boone's career, which focused on covering [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] songs by black artists for a white American market.<ref name="Schoemer">[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_28.shtml Karen Schoemer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902150344/http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2006/1/2006_1_28.shtml|date=September 2, 2010 }} "More Mr. Nice Guy", ''American Heritage'', Feb/March 2006.</ref> Randy Wood, the owner of Dot, had issued an R&B single by the Griffin Brothers in 1951 called "Tra La La-a"—a different song from the later [[LaVern Baker]] one—and he was keen to put out another version after the original had failed. This became the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the first Boone single "Two Hearts Two Kisses", originally by the Charms – whose "Hearts Of Stone" had been covered by the label's [[Fontane Sisters]].

A number-one single in 1956 by Boone was a second cover and a revival of a then seven-year-old song "[[I Almost Lost My Mind]]", by [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], which was originally covered by another black star, [[Nat King Cole]]. According to an opinion poll of high-school students in 1957, the singer was nearly the "two-to-one favorite over Elvis Presley among boys and preferred almost three-to-one by girls&nbsp;..."<ref>See the statistics in Ennis, Philip H., ''The Seventh Stream: The Emergence of Rocknroll in American Popular Music'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1992), pp. 251–52</ref> During the late 1950s, he made regular appearances on ABC-TV's ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'', hosted by his father-in-law.
He cultivated a safe, wholesome, advertiser-friendly image that won him a long-term product endorsement contract from [[General Motors]] during the late 1950s, lasting through the 1960s. He succeeded [[The Dinah Shore Chevy Show|Dinah Shore]] singing the praises of the GM product: "See the USA in your Chevrolet&nbsp;... drive your Chevrolet through the USA, America's the greatest land of all!" GM had also sponsored ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]''.

Many of Boone's hit singles were covers of hits from black Rock and Roll artists. These included: "Ain't That a Shame" by Fats Domino; "[[Tutti Frutti (song)|Tutti Frutti]]" and "[[Long Tall Sally]]" by [[Little Richard]];<ref name=pc6>{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19752/m1|title=Show 6 – Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll: The rock revolution gets underway|website=Digital.library.unt.edu |date=March 16, 1969|access-date=September 20, 2010}}</ref> "[[At My Front Door|At My Front Door (Crazy Little Mama)]]" by [[The El Dorados]]; and the [[blues ballad]]s "[[I Almost Lost My Mind]]" by [[Ivory Joe Hunter]], "I'll be Home" by [[the Flamingos]] and "[[Don't Forbid Me]]" by [[Charles Singleton (songwriter)|Charles Singleton]]. Boone also wrote the lyrics for the instrumental theme song for the movie ''[[Exodus (1960 film)|Exodus]]'', which he titled "This Land Is Mine". ([[Ernest Gold (composer)|Ernest Gold]] had composed the music.)

As a conservative Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles that he felt might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol [[Marilyn Monroe]]. In one of his first films, ''April Love'', the director, [[Henry Levin (film director)|Henry Levin]], wanted him to give co-star [[Shirley Jones]] a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted to talk to his wife first, to make sure it was all right with her.<ref>{{cite web|last=King|first=Susan|title=A Pat Boone kiss-and-tell|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/aug/11/entertainment/la-et-classic-hollywood-20100811|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=June 15, 2012}}</ref> He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.<ref name="cooga">{{cite news|title=Boone to Expand, Buys Two Stories: West Claims Hugh Marlowe; Big Brother's '1984' to Stage |author=Scheuer, Philip K.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 11, 1960|page=23}}</ref>

He appeared as a regular performer on ''[[Arthur Godfrey and His Friends]]'' from 1955 through 1957, and later hosted his own ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'', on Thursday evenings. In 1959, Boone's likeness was licensed to [[DC Comics]], first appearing in ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]'' No. 9 (May 1959) before starring in his own series from the publisher which lasted for five issues from September 1959 to May 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://comicvine.gamespot.com/pat-boone-1/4000-56483/|title=Pat Boone No. 1 (Issue)|website=Comic Vine|access-date=March 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Cowsill |first1=Alan |last2=Irvine |first2=Alex |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=McAvennie |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |title=DC Comics Year By Year: A Visual Chronicle |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-8578-6 |page=89}}</ref>  In the early 1960s, he began writing a series of self-help books for adolescents, including ''Twixt Twelve and Twenty''. The [[British Invasion]] ended Boone's career as a hitmaker, though he continued recording throughout the 1960s. In the 1970s, he switched to [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[Country music|country]], and he continued performing in other media, as well. In the 1960s and 1970s. the Boone family toured as gospel singers and made gospel albums, such as ''The Pat Boone Family'' and ''The Family Who Prays''.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1978, Boone became the first target in the [[Federal Trade Commission]]'s crackdown on false-claim product endorsements by celebrities. He had appeared with his daughter Debby in a commercial to claim that all four of his daughters had found a preparation named Acne-Statin a "real help" in keeping their skin clear. The FTC filed a complaint against the manufacturer, contending that the product did not really keep skin free of blemishes. Boone eventually signed a consent order in which he promised not only to stop appearing in the ads, but also to pay about 2.5% of any money that the FTC or the courts might eventually order the manufacturer to refund to consumers. Boone said, through a lawyer, that his daughters actually did use Acne-Statin, and that he was "dismayed to learn that the product's efficacy had not been scientifically established as he believed."<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=May 22, 1978|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919667,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080130110306/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919667,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 30, 2008|title=Let the Stellar Seller Beware|access-date=December 2, 2007}}</ref>

=== Film ===
[[File:Pat Boone, Pic, 10.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Pat Boone, circa 1960]]
In 1956 Boone was one of the biggest recording stars in the US. Several film studios pursued him for movies; he decided to go with [[20th Century Fox]], which had made [[Elvis Presley]]'s first movie.<ref>{{cite news|author=Hopper, Hedda|title=Bidding is hot as Pat Boone signs multi-movie contract|work=Chicago Daily Tribune|date=November 16, 1956|page=A4}}</ref> Fox reworked a play he had bought, ''Bernardine'', into a vehicle for Boone.

Even more popular was ''[[April Love (film)|April Love]]'' (1957), a remake of ''[[Home in Indiana]]''. Boone regards it as one of his favourites, "the kind of movie I wish I could have made 20 more of: a musical, appealing characters, some drama, a good storyline, a happy ending, it's the kind of film which makes you feel good. I never wanted to make a depressing or immoral film."<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pNQylJinyQsC&q=%22pat+boone%22+%22yellow+canary%22+interview&pg=PA13|page=6|title="Movies Were Always Magical": Interviews with 19 Actors, Directors, and Producers from the Hollywood of the 1930s through the 1950s|first=Leo|last=Verswijver|publisher=McFarland|date=2003|isbn=9780786411290}}</ref>

Less popular was a musical comedy ''[[Mardi Gras (1958 film)|Mardi Gras]]'' (1958), which was the last movie of [[Edmund Goulding]]. However, ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth (1959 film)|Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' (1959), a science fiction adventure tale, was a huge hit. Boone had been reluctant to do it, and needed to be persuaded by being offered the chance to sing several songs and given a percentage of the profits, but was glad he did.<ref name="vagg">{{Cite magazine|url=https://diaboliquemagazine.com/the-surprisingly-interesting-cinema-of-pat-boone/|first=Stephen|last=Vagg|date=September 10, 2019|magazine=Diabolique Magazine|title=The Surprisingly Interesting Cinema of Pat Boone}}</ref>

He produced and starred in a documentary, ''[[Salute to the Teenagers]]'' (1960), but did not make a film for a while, studying acting with [[Sanford Meisner]]. He returned with a military comedy, ''[[All Hands on Deck (1961 film)|All Hands on Deck]]'' (1961), a mild hit.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rumors Have Marlon Married to Movita|author=Dorothy Kilgallen|work=The Washington Post, Times Herald|date= March 12, 1961|page=G3}}</ref>

He was one of several names in another remake, ''[[State Fair (1962 film)|State Fair]]'' (1962), a box office disappointment. Musicals were becoming less fashionable in Hollywood, so Boone decided to take on a dramatic role in the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer-distributed movie ''[[The Main Attraction (film)|The Main Attraction]]'' (1962) for [[Seven Arts Productions]], his first movie outside Fox. It was an unhappy experience for Boone as he disliked the implication his character had sex with [[Nancy Kwan]]'s and he got into several public fights with the producers.<ref name="la">{{cite news|title=Boone Fights Use of Movie That Lacks OK|author=Ryon, Art|work=Los Angeles Times|date=December 15, 1962|page=B5}}</ref> He had a deal with Fox to make three films at $200,000 a film with his production company. This was meant to start with a thriller, ''[[The Yellow Canary]]'' (1963), in which Boone would play an unsympathetic character. New management came in at the studio which was unenthusiastic about the picture but because Boone had a pay or play deal, they decided to make it anyway, only with a much shorter budget. Boone even paid some money out of his own pocket to help complete it.<ref name="robert">Mark Thomas McGee, ''Talk's Cheap, Action's Expensive: The Films of Robert L. Lippert'', Bear Manor Media, 2014, pp. 271–72</ref>

Boone's next movie for Fox was another low-budget effort, ''[[The Horror of It All]]'' (1963), shot in England. He shot a comedy in Ireland, ''[[Never Put It in Writing]]'' (1964) for Allied Artists. Boone's third film for Fox was an "A" production, ''[[Goodbye Charlie]]'' (1964), but Boone was in support of [[Debbie Reynolds]] and [[Tony Curtis]]. He was one of the many names in ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' (1965). He appeared in ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1967 film)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' (1967), a pilot for a TV series that did not eventuate, which was screened in some theatres. Boone's last film of note was ''[[The Cross and the Switchblade (film)|The Cross and the Switchblade]]'' (1970).

He was then dismissed from ''Gospel America'', a TV show on the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]. After making a special appearance on TBN with the president of the network, [[Paul Crouch]], and his pastor, Jack Hayford, many fans accepted his explanation of the leather outfit being a "parody of himself". Trinity Broadcasting then reinstated him, and ''Gospel America'' was brought back.<ref name="Pat"/>

In 2003, the Nashville [[Gospel Music Association]] recognized his gospel recording work by inducting him into its [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]].

Boone grew up in the [[Churches of Christ|Church of Christ]].<ref name="religion">{{cite web|title=The religion of Pat Boone, singer|url=http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Pat_Boone.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731090423/http://www.adherents.com/people/pb/Pat_Boone.html|url-status=usurped|archive-date=July 31, 2005|website=Adherents.com|access-date=June 6, 2010}}</ref> In the 1960s, Boone's marriage to Shirley Foley nearly came to an end because of his use of alcohol and his preference for attending parties. However, after coming into contact with the [[Charismatic Movement]], Shirley began to focus more on her religion and eventually influenced Pat and their daughters toward a similar religious focus.<ref>{{cite book|last=Neitz|first=Mary Jo|title=Charisma and Community: A Study of Religious Commitment Within the Charismatic Renewal|year=1987|publisher=Transaction Publishers|location=New Brunswick NJ|isbn=978-0-88738-130-0|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KrUr2ydLiwAC}}</ref>  At this time, they attended the [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood Church of Christ]].

In the spring of 1964, Boone spoke at a "Project Prayer" rally attended by 2,500 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. The gathering, which was hosted by [[Anthony Eisley]], a star of ABC's ''[[Hawaiian Eye]]'' series, sought to flood the [[United States Congress]] with letters in support of mandatory [[school prayer]], following two decisions in 1962 and 1963 of the [[United States Supreme Court]] which struck down mandatory prayer as conflicting with the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=pearson>{{cite web|url=http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf|title="The Washington Merry-Go-Round", Drew Pearson column, May 14, 1964|website=Dspace.wrlc.org|access-date=January 13, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116232324/http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf|archive-date=January 16, 2013}}</ref> Joining Boone and Eisley at the Project Prayer rally were [[Walter Brennan]], [[Lloyd Nolan]], [[Rhonda Fleming]], [[Gloria Swanson]], and [[Dale Evans]]. Boone declared, "what the communists want is to subvert and undermine our young people.&nbsp;... I believe in the power of aroused Americans, I believe in the wisdom of our Constitution.&nbsp;... the power of God."<ref name=pearson/> It was noted that [[Roy Rogers]], [[John Wayne]], [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Jane Russell]], [[Ginger Rogers]], and [[Pat Buttram]] had endorsed the goals of the rally and would also have attended had their schedules not been in conflict.<ref name=pearson/>

In the early 1970s, the Boones hosted Bible studies for celebrities such as [[Doris Day]], [[Glenn Ford]], [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]], and [[Priscilla Presley]] at their Beverly Hills home. The family then began attending [[The Church On The Way]] in [[Van Nuys, Los Angeles, California|Van Nuys]], a [[International Church of the Foursquare Gospel|Foursquare Gospel]] megachurch pastored by [[Jack Hayford]].<ref name="Pat">{{cite magazine|last=Gilbreath|first=Edward|title=Why Pat Boone Went 'Bad'|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/1999/october4/9tb056.html|magazine=Christianity Today|access-date=October 4, 2009}}</ref>

On an April 22, 2016, broadcast of [[Fox News Radio]]'s ''[[The Alan Colmes Show]]'', Boone discussed an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' which included a sketch entitled ''God Is a Boob Man''; the sketch parodied the film ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', in which Boone had a role.<ref name=Colmes>[http://radio.foxnews.com/2016/04/22/pat-boone-the-fcc-should-punish-blasphemy Pat Boone: The FCC Should Punish Blasphemy], on ''[[The Alan Colmes Show]]''; published April 22, 2016.

=== Politics ===
Boone supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[1964 United States presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/When_Hollywood_Was_Right/QfHXAAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=pat%20boone | title=When Hollywood Was Right: How Movie Stars, Studio Moguls, and Big Business Remade American Politics| isbn=9781107650282| last1=Critchlow| first1=Donald T.| date=2013-10-21}}</ref>

In the 2007 Kentucky gubernatorial election, Boone campaigned unsuccessfully for incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Ernie Fletcher]] with a recorded automated telephone message stating that the Democratic Party candidate [[Steve Beshear]] would support "every homosexual cause." As part of the campaign, Boone asked, "Now do you want a governor who'd like Kentucky to be another San Francisco?"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2007/11/kentucky_gop_pushing_antigay_message_in_final_days_of_gov_race.php|title=Kentucky GOP Pushing Anti-Gay Message in Final Days Of Gov Race|work=TPM Election Central|first=Eric|last=Kleefeld|date=November 4, 2007|access-date=November 5, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105172656/http://tpmelectioncentral.com/2007/11/kentucky_gop_pushing_antigay_message_in_final_days_of_gov_race.php|archive-date=November 5, 2007}}</ref>

In June 2016, Boone, along with [[Mike Huckabee]] and executive producer Troy Duhon, all of whom were involved in the film ''[[God's Not Dead 2]]'', sent a letter to California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] in opposition to Senate Bill 1146<ref>{{cite web|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1146|title=Bill Text – SB-1146 Discrimination: postsecondary education.|website=Leginfo.legislature.ca.gov|access-date=January 22, 2019}}</ref> which "prohibits a person from being subjected to discrimination" at California colleges.

=== Basketball ===
Boone is a basketball fan and had ownership interests in two teams. He owned a team in the Hollywood Studio League called the Cooga Moogas. The Cooga Moogas included [[Bill Cosby]], [[Rafer Johnson]], [[Gardner McKay]], [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]], and [[Denny Miller|Denny "Tarzan" Miller]].<ref name="RTABA">{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/Oakland-Oaks.html|title=Oakland Oaks|work=Remember the ABA|access-date=November 10, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223307/http://www.remembertheaba.com/Oakland-Oaks.html|archive-date=September 27, 2007}}</ref>

With the founding of the [[American Basketball Association]], Boone became the majority owner of the league's team in [[Oakland, California]], on February 2, 1967.<ref name="RTABA"/> The team was first named the Oakland Americans, but was later renamed as the [[Oakland Oaks (ABA)|Oakland Oaks]], the name under which it played from 1967 to 1969.<ref name="RTABA"/> The Oaks won the [[1969 ABA Playoffs|1969 ABA championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1969Playoffs.html|title=1968–69 ABA Regular Season Standings|work=Remember the ABA|access-date=November 10, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017202704/http://remembertheaba.com/PlayoffPages/1969Playoffs.html|archive-date=October 17, 2007}}</ref>

Despite the Oaks' success on the court, the team had severe financial problems. By August 1969, the [[Bank of America]] was threatening to foreclose on a $1.2 million loan to the Oaks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/VirginiaMaterial/OaksCapsSquiresYearly.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614055042/http://remembertheaba.com/VirginiaMaterial/OaksCapsSquiresYearly.html|archive-date=June 14, 2007|title=Oakland Oaks/Washington Caps/Virginia Squires Year-to-Year Franchise Notes|work=Remember the ABA |access-date=November 10, 2007}}</ref> and the team was sold to a group of businessmen in Washington, D.C., and became the [[Washington Caps]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.remembertheaba.com/VirginiaMaterial/SquiresRosters2.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626220240/http://www.remembertheaba.com/VirginiaMaterial/SquiresRosters2.html|archive-date=June 26, 2007|title=Oakland Oaks/Washington Caps/Virginia Squires Year-to-Year Rosters|work=Remember the ABA|access-date=November 10, 2007}}</ref>
