[[File:Look how far to go.jpg|thumb|left|Road to Humbe (EN-105)]]
'''Humbe''' is a town and [[Communes of Angola|commune]] in the municipality of [[Ombadja]], province of [[Cunene Province|Cunene]], Angola.

It also used to be the location of a [[Roman Catholic]] [[mission station]] in southern [[Angola]], located ca. 10 [[kilometre|km]] to the north-east of [[Xangongo]], in the tribal area of the [[Ombadja]] tribe of the [[Owambo people|Ovambo]]s. It was located on a [[tributary]] of the [[Kunene River]], flowing into this river from the north.

Humbe was established in ca. 1882, after the Catholics had made a failed attempt to establish themselves near the [[Finnish Missionary Society|Finnish]] mission station of [[Olukonda]] in [[Ondonga]], [[Ovamboland]], in 1879, and in then in [[Omaruru, Namibia|Omaruru]], [[Hereroland]], further south in [[South West Africa]] in 1882.<ref>Peltola 1958, p. 79–80, 287.</ref>

The attempts of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] to subjugate the Ovambos of Ombadja and [[Oukwanyama]] were initially unsuccessful, and 1904 they suffered a massive defeat [[Battle of the Cunene|at the Cunene river]]. In response, the Portuguese established [[Forte Roçadas]] in 1906 in what is now [[Xangongo]], not far from Humbe.<ref>Peltola 1958, p. 136.</ref>
