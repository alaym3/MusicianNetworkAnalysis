'''Palaye Royale''' is a Canadian-American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Las Vegas]], formed in 2008 by brothers Remington Leith, Sebastian Danzig, and Emerson Barrett. The brothers' true surname is Kropp; each one's stage moniker makes use of their respective middle names.

==History==
===As Kropp Circle (2008–2011)===
Sebastian, the oldest brother, is a self-proclaimed Canadian, having been born in Canada, on Canada Day. Remington and Emerson were later born in the States after the family moved to Las Vegas soon after Sebastian's birth. They formed the band Kropp Circle in 2008, with Sebastian (then 16) on guitar, Remington (then 14) on vocals, and Emerson (then 12) on drums.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kropp Circle Bio {{!}} Broadjam.com |url=https://www.broadjam.com/bio/kroppcircle |access-date=21 May 2021 |website=Broadjam |language=en}}</ref> Kropp Circle was featured in the online [[Radio Disney]] show ''N.B.T.

===As Palaye Royale (2012–present)===
Now describing themselves as a "fashion-art rock band", Palaye Royale released their first single "Morning Light" in March 2012.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Palaye Royale {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/palaye-royale-mn0003473891/biography |access-date=21 May 2021 |website=AllMusic |language=en}}</ref> The six-song EP ''The Ends Beginning'' was released in June 2013. In 2014 they were the first unsigned band to win [[MTV]]'s ''Musical March Madness'' tournament, beating out artists such as [[Linkin Park]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=PALAYE ROYALE THANK THEIR 'CULT' OF FANS FOR MMM WIN |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1725795/palaye-royale-mmm-soldiers-council-fans/ |access-date=22 January 2018 |website=Mtv.com}}</ref>

In late 2015 they signed with [[Sumerian Records]],<ref name=":0" /> and released their first full-length album ''Boom Boom Room (Side A)'' in June 2016.<ref>{{Citation |title=Boom Boom Room (Side A) - Palaye Royale {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/boom-boom-room-side-a-mw0002935898 |language=en |access-date=21 May 2021}}</ref> The single "Get Higher" peaked at #26 on the [[Billboard Charts|Billboard Modern Rock Charts]].<ref>{{Cite magazine |title=Palaye Royale Debut On Emerging Artist Chart, Mitchell Tenpenny Keeps Climbing |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/8479262/palaye-royale-debut-emerging-artist-chart |magazine=Billboard |language=en |access-date=21 May 2021}}</ref> They travelled with the [[Warped Tour]] in 2016.
