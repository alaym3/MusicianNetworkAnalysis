'''New Years Day''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Anaheim, California]], in 2005. After building a reputation strictly through promotion on the social networking website [[MySpace]], the band released its debut [[#Extended plays|self-titled EP]] in 2006 and their first full-length album ''[[My Dear]]'' in 2007. Six years after their initial debut, ''[[Victim to Villain]]'' was finally released, followed by ''[[Malevolence (New Years Day album)|Malevolence]]'' in 2015. ''[[Malevolence (New Years Day album)|Malevolence]]'' peaked at {{abbr|No.|Number}} 45 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the band's highest charting thus far.

==History==

===2005: Inception and formation===
New Years Day formed in 2005, after bassist Adam Lohrbach left the band [[Home Grown]]. Lohrbach carried over the many emotional elements present in Home Grown's final 2004 [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[When It All Comes Down]]'' and cultivated it into new material for New Years Day. Meeting with lead vocalist Ashley "Ash" Costello (born 1985) and guitarist/keyboardist Keith Drover, the three friends wrote and rehearsed songs about their difficult and emotional relationship break-ups.<ref name="New Year's Day official biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.newyearsdayrocks.com/?location=bio|title=New Years Day official biography|publisher=Newyearsdayrocks.com|access-date=April 22, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019093713/http://www.newyearsdayrocks.com/?location=bio|archive-date=October 19, 2007}}</ref> Soon after, the group produced a two-song demo and invited a mutual friend of the group, Eric Seilo, to play bass during their 2005 tours. Ultimately, Seilo left New Years Day at the end of 2005 to pursue higher education.<ref name=Sputnik>{{cite web|url=http://www.sputnikmusic.com/bands/New-Years-Day/12288/ |title=New Years Day reviews, music, news |publisher=sputnikmusic |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> After acquiring former [[Wakefield (band)|Wakefield]] guitarist Mike Schoolden and drummer Russell Dixon, the group decided to call themselves New Years Day.

===2006–2010: ''Razor'' and ''My Dear''===
The band built a surprisingly strong online presence through showcasing, promotion and posting songs on [[MySpace]]. New Years Day was featured on the ''[[MySpace Records]], Volume 1'' compilation CD and on the video game soundtrack for ''[[Saints Row]]''. After considering an offer from [[Pete Wentz]]'s [[DCD2 Records|Decaydance Records]] label, the band decided to sign with [[TVT Records]] instead and released their first [[#Extended plays|self-titled EP]] in 2006. Originally referred to as ''Razor'', the [[Extended play|EP]] was primarily marketed as a digital release accessible through downloading services, although CD hard copies were also sold to fans at live shows. New Years Day performed at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VZoakAhY8s |title=New Years Day @ Emo's SXSW |publisher=YouTube |date=March 22, 2007 |access-date=July 25, 2015}}</ref>

By May 8, 2007, New Years Day released its debut album ''[[My Dear]],'' which was self-financed, self-produced and recorded over an eight-month period by friend and producer Eugene Perreras.<ref name="New Year's Day official biography" /> The album included collaborations with members of [[Reel Big Fish]] and [[Motion City Soundtrack]]. During this period of time, the band toured with fellow artists, [[The Fall of Troy (band)|The Fall of Troy]], [[The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]], [[Ozma (band)|Ozma]] and [[Hawthorne Heights]]. Guitarist Keith Drover left the band shortly after touring to move to Sweden. The band debuted the music video for the lead single "I Was Right", directed by [[Shane Drake]]. Notably, the video won the [[MTVU]] "Freshman Face" poll and was added to the channel's ongoing playlist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvu.com/music/freshmen/archive.jhtml|title=MTVU Freshman Face archive|publisher=MTVU.com|access-date=April 22, 2007}}</ref>

In 2008, TVT went bankrupt and was forced to sell its recording assets to [[The Orchard (record label)|The Orchard]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Hudak |first=Joseph |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/02/19/tvt-records-folds-forcing-entire-polyphonic-spree-to-panhandle/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306020653/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2008/02/19/tvt-records-folds-forcing-entire-polyphonic-spree-to-panhandle/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 6, 2008 |title=Music &#124; New Music News, Reviews, Pictures, and Videos |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Consequently, ''[[My Dear]]'' lacked the proper promotion required to succeed and Schoolden and Lohrbach both left the band shortly thereafter.<ref name="hitthefloor.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.hitthefloor.co.uk/2010/01/interview-ashley-costello-new-years-day.html |title=Magazine – Music, Lifestyle, Awesomeness! |publisher=Hit The Floor |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref> Despite the small setbacks, the remaining members continued writing new material. Around September 2009, New Years Day posted two brand new songs on MySpace.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=7136489&blogId=506082060 |title=Featured Content on Myspace |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |access-date=August 26, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 }}</ref> When asked about the upcoming EP, Costello remarked, "The EP is in its demo phase right now and we are still writing for it and recording it at the same time. The EP should be out in the spring of 2010."<ref name="hitthefloor.co.uk"/>

It's something we know everyone can relate to on their own level. The world can infect us with its negativity, and it's okay to struggle with it. That's truly what ''Epidemic'' is about. Owning the diseased parts of us and turning it into a strength."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/new_years_day_announce_new_ep_release_other_side_video |title=New Years Day announce new EP, release "Other Side" video – Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=September 15, 2014 |access-date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>
