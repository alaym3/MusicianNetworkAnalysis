He is best known for his work as the voice of [[Finn the Human]] from the American animated television series ''[[Adventure Time]]'' and [[Lance (Voltron)|Lance]] in ''[[Voltron: Legendary Defender]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://comicbook.com/anime/2018/03/09/voltron-jeremy-shada-interview/|title= 'Voltron': Lance Voice Actor Jeremy Shada on the Paladins, Lotor, and the Mystery of Shir|date= March 8, 2017 |work= Comic Book}}</ref> He is also known for starring as various characters in the sketch-comedy series ''[[Incredible Crew]]''. His most recent appearance is in the 2020 [[Netflix original]] television series, ''[[Julie and the Phantoms]]'', as Reggie Peters, one of four main cast members, including [[Charlie Gillespie]], [[Owen Joyner]], and [[Madison Reyes]].

== Life and career ==
Shada was born in [[Boise, Idaho]]. He began acting at the age of seven, soon after moving to [[Los Angeles]] with his family. He was inspired to act by his older brother, actor [[Zack Shada]].

Shada initially appeared in commercials. Later on, he began auditioning for voice acting and theatrical performances, taking advice from a voice-over agent. His first live-action theatrical role was as Young Kurt Diamond in ''[[No Rules (film)|No Rules]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mutant Season: Jeremy Shada of Adventure Time|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2012/05/the-mutant-season-29-jeremy-shada-of-adventure-time/|publisher=Nerdist.com|access-date=June 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233957/http://www.nerdist.com/2012/05/the-mutant-season-29-jeremy-shada-of-adventure-time/|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> He has since appeared in additional live-action and voice acting roles, such as playing young [[Charlie Pace]] in childhood flashbacks on ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Covel|first=Bonnie|title=Greatest Hits, Episode 5/16/07 Preview|url=http://lost.about.com/od/previewsandspoilers/a/3x21pre.htm|publisher=About.com|access-date=June 4, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514061218/http://lost.about.com/od/previewsandspoilers/a/3x21pre.htm|archive-date=May 14, 2013}}</ref>

In 2009, Jeremy Shada's agent approached him with the idea of auditioning for the role of Finn in ''[[Adventure Time]]''; his brother Zack had been the original voice of Finn in the [[Pilot episode|pilot]] episode of ''Adventure Time'' three years prior. After viewing the pilot on YouTube, Shada matched his voice with the voice of his brother in auditions with ''Adventure Time'' creator [[Pendleton Ward]] and the show's producers, which earned him the role.<ref>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Noelene|title='Adventure Time': Finn actor Jeremy Shada is 'constantly surprised'|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/adventure-time-finn-actor-jeremy-shada-is-constantly-surprised/#/0|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, Shada joined the cast of [[Nick Cannon]]'s sketch-comedy series, ''[[Incredible Crew]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Luoma|first=Sarah|title=Production Begins On Nick Cannon's 'Incredible Crew'|url=http://www.tvequals.com/2012/06/18/production-begins-on-nick-cannons-incredible-crew/|work=TV Equals|publisher=Daemons Media Inc.|access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref> In June 2012, to promote ''Incredible Crew'''s 2013 premiere, Cartoon Network released a music rap video titled "Running Errands with My Mom" which features Shada performing and rapping the lyrics. The video has since generated over one million views.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Tamron|title=Teen's errands with mom creates online buzz|url=http://www.today.com/video/today/50068192#50068192|work=Today Show|publisher=NBC Universal|access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref>

Because of his acting schedule, Shada was [[homeschooled]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Mutant Season: Jeremy Shada of "Adventure Time|url=http://www.nerdist.com/2012/05/the-mutant-season-29-jeremy-shada-of-adventure-time/|work=The Mutant Season|publisher=Nerdist|access-date=June 4, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004233957/http://www.nerdist.com/2012/05/the-mutant-season-29-jeremy-shada-of-adventure-time/|archive-date=October 4, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> Answering fan questions on his Facebook page, Shada indicated that he graduated from high school early in May 2013.

Along with his brother Zack, Shada is a member of the pop-punk band [[Make Out Monday]], which was formed in 2014. The band performed at the 2014 [[San Diego Comic-Con]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hasty|first1=Katie|title=TGIM: Make Out Monday is playing a show for you at Comic-Con|url=http://www.hitfix.com/news/jeremy-shada-of-adventure-time-bows-new-band-music-video-exclusive-premiere#CSrbDicD7Mohijix.99|website=hitfix.com/|publisher=HitFlix, Inc.|access-date=July 22, 2014}}</ref>
