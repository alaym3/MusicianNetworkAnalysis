==Early life==
Jonny McGovern was born to Mary McGovern and Rob Gutowski in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. His parents traveled often and McGovern grew up primarily in [[Egypt]] and [[Thailand]].<ref name="Egypt">{{cite web|author=Waechter, Patrick Steven.|url=http://gaypimp.com/index.php/content/view/177/29/|title=The Gay Pimp Gets Sketchy|date=April 11, 2007|publisher=GayPimp.com|access-date=December 13, 2007}}</ref> McGovern later returned to the United States to study [[acting]] at [[Boston University]], where he earned a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]]. He is [[coming out|openly]] [[gay]].<ref name="afterelton">{{cite web |url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2007/5/jonnymcgovern |title=Interview With Jonny McGovern |work=AfterElton.com |first=Karman |last=Kregloe |date=14 May 2007 |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref>

==Career==

McGovern stated that he was inspired to create his signature comedic character, The Gay Pimp, after listening to rap songs and interviews by [[Eminem]]. McGovern has said,

{{blockquote|It started off with Eminem. I was appalled by him ripping on fags and talking mad shit. People were protesting, but how could you protest a pop star? I figured my best way of protesting was to write a big, flashy, glamorous, funny show... called ''The Wrong Fag to Fuck With: The Gay Pimp vs. Eminem''. It was where the Gay Pimp was a pop star/superhero who came out at the [[MTV]] awards to battle Eminem. Of course it did end with Eminem getting it up the butt and being humiliated while all the gay teens were set free.<ref name="After Elton">{{cite web|author=Weiss, Matthew.|url=http://www.afterelton.com/people/2007/5/jonnymcgovern?page=0%2C0|title=After Elton Interview With Jonny McGovern|date=May 14, 2007|publisher=AfterElton.com|access-date=December 13, 2007}}</ref>}}

After the songs from the show began to get heavy rotation in New York City nightclubs, McGovern was approached about making a [[music video]] for one of his songs, ''Soccer Practice''.<ref name="After Elton" />

The success of the single garnered attention for McGovern, and he contributed commentary on a variety of [[VH1]] shows (such as ''[[Best Week Ever]]'', ''Totally Gay'', and ''40 Dumbest Celebrity Quotes'') as well as earned a slot on [[Comedy Central|Comedy Central's]] all-gay comedy show ''Out on the Edge'', hosted by [[Alan Cumming]].<ref name="comedycentral">{{cite web |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/comedians/browse/m/jonny_mcgovern.jhtml |title=Jonny McGovern on Comedy Central |access-date=February 20, 2007}}</ref>

McGovern hosts his own YouTube show on StreamTV titled ''Hey Qween!'', where he interviews various icons of the LGBT community. The show was co-hosted up until 2020 by the late [[Lady Red Couture]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-07-26|title='Hey Qween's Lady Red Couture, LA Drag Icon, Has Died|url=https://www.out.com/drag/2020/7/26/hey-qweens-lady-red-couture-la-drag-icon-has-died|access-date=2020-07-30|website=www.out.com|language=en}}</ref> As a tribute to her passing, McGovern released the 3-track EP ''Flowers (Songs to Lady Red)'' in November 2020, with [[Adam Joseph]] as producer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Cook|first=Michael|date=2020-11-30|title=Jonny McGovern Pays Homage To Lady Red Couture In Two Unique Ways|url=https://instinctmagazine.com/jonny-mcgovern-pays-homage-to-lady-red-couture-in-two-unique-ways/|access-date=2020-12-14|website=Instinct Magazine|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Jonny McGovern's Instagram post: "is a 3 song EP written and recorded as I dealt with the grief and shock of losing Lady Red.
