==History==

===Formation (2008)===
Guitarist Jake Hardy and bassist Cameron Adler already had an existing rock project covering other bands' material. Later, they met Whakaio Taahi through mutual friends, and asked him to join in on keyboard and lead guitar.

Jenna McDougall was writing her own acoustic music at the time, and had Adler helping her record and produce a demo. After the demo was finished, Adler gave McDougall a song the band had written and asked her to record her vocals over it. On 31 May 2008, the day before her sixteenth birthday, McDougall joined as lead vocalist, forming the first version of the band.

With shows booked and no band name, the band got together and cut out words they thought described livelihood and the band, coming up with the name '''Tonight Alive'''.

After the first year, the band lost their original drummer. Matty Best, a high school friend of Taahi, joined on after finding out they needed a drummer from Taahi's mother. Best travelled three to four hours to band practice.

The band started to make a name for themselves, opening for metal bands, playing small festival type shows, and spent plenty of time playing local shows at youth centres around the Sydney area.{{Citation needed|reason=Needs to be a reliable source on how the band really started in terms of its members and their following|date=June 2014}}

===''All Shapes & Disguises'' and ''Consider This EP'' (2009–2010)===
In 2009, the band entered the studio to record their debut self-funded EP ''All Shapes & Disguises'' with producer Greg Stace and producer Dave Petrovic, which was released in June 2010, with their music video and debut single "Wasting Away" being released that same month.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhdaCt2DhE0 |title=Tonight Alive - 'Wasting Away' OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=14 June 2010 |access-date=2012-03-27}}</ref> McDougall was still in school at the time. She took time off school to record, and her parents covered her share of the cost to rent studio space.

The track "Closer" was featured on season six of the US reality TV show ''[[The Hills (TV series)|The Hills]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vaughan |first=Owen |url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/music/sydney-band-on-the-hills/story-e6frfn09-1225881022570 |title=Sydney band Tonight Alive crashes US TV |website=News.com.au |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=2012-03-27}}</ref>

In November 2010, the band released a three track EP ''[[Consider This (Tonight Alive EP)|Consider This]]'', before heading on a national tour with Australian band Sienna Skies.

===''What Are You So Scared Of?'' (2011−12)===
After being noticed by some large record labels, Tonight Alive was invited to play a showcase. Despite both guitarists, Taahi and Hardy, snapping a string each on the first song, the band was signed anyway.

In late 2010, a demo of Tonight Alive's new material landed on producer [[Mark Trombino]]'s desk. He then contacted the band, wanting to take part in producing their debut full-length record.<ref name="Tonight Alive">{{cite web|url=http://www.tonightaliveofficial.com/bio/home.do |title=Tonight Alive |website=Tonightaliveofficial.com |access-date=2012-03-27}}</ref>

"For him to contact us, and say he was interested, was a big deal," says Jenna. "We couldn't believe he'd put himself out like that. He's amazing. Mark created the albums we all grew up listening to - the albums that launched the careers of all these great bands."

In the early months of 2011, Tonight Alive flew to [[Los Angeles]] and recorded their debut full-length at NRG Studios over two months.<ref name="Tonight Alive"/>

The band also played their 2011 Australian tour with supporting bands such as Skyway and For This Cause.

The track "To Die For", originally from the band's first EP ''All Shapes & Disguises'' and "Thank You and Goodnight", originally from the band's second EP ''Consider This'', was re-recorded on this record. "Thank You & Goodnight" features guest vocals from [[Blink-182]]'s [[Mark Hoppus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/new_tonight_alive_song_featuring_mark_hoppus_surfaces_online |title=Alternative Press &#124; News &#124; Listen to a new Tonight Alive song featuring Mark Hoppus |website=Altpress.com |date=11 October 2011 |access-date=2012-03-27}}</ref>

The band was set to play on the Lucky Street Tour with [[Go Radio]] and [[This Providence]] and SXSW until they had to pull out due to medical issues, writing on their Facebook page: "We're very sorry to announce that we are having to cancel our upcoming tour with Go Radio and SXSW appearances due to serious medical issues."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10150584345065812&set=a.470024465811.255357.155381905811&type=1 | title=Tonight Alive Facebook post March 8 | website=Facebook.com |access-date=21 April 2012 }}</ref> This was later revealed to be due to Mcdougall suffering from severe eczema, making it hard for her to move.
