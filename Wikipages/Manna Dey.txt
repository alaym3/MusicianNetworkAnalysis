==Early life==
Dey was born in a Bengali family to Mahamaya and Purna Chandra Dey on 1 May 1919 in Calcutta (Now [[Kolkata]]).

Dey began taking music lessons from Krishna Chandra Dey and Ustad Dabir Khan. During this period of learning, he stood first for three consecutive years in three different categories of inter-collegiate singing competitions.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

==Career==

===Early career (1942–1953)===
In 1942, Dey accompanied [[Krishna Chandra Dey]] on a visit to [[Mumbai|Bombay]]. There he started working as an assistant music director first under Krishna Chandra Dey in a Bengali film ''Chanakya'' in 1939 and then under [[Sachin Dev Burman]]. Later, he assisted other music composers and then started to work independently. While working independently as a music director for various Hindi movies, Manna Dey continued to take musical lessons in [[Hindustani classical music]] from Ustad Aman Ali Khan and Ustad Abdul Rahman Khan. He often works with near about 185 music directors in his singing career in Bollywood.

Dey started his career in playback singing with the movie ''Tamanna'', in 1942. The musical score was by Krishna Chandra Dey and Manna sang a duet named "Jago Aayee Usha Ponchi Boley Jago" with [[Suraiya]] which was an instant hit.

But it was only in 1943 that he got his first solo break with ''Ram Rajya''. Incidentally, the producer of the film Vijay Bhatt and its composer Shankar Rao Vyas had approached K C Dey with an offer for playback in the film. When K C Dey refused the offer on the grounds that he would not lend his voice to other actors, they spotted Manna Dey sitting in the corner of the room and offered him the opportunity.

Shankar Rao Vyas taught Manna Dey the songs and he chose to sing them in his uncle's distinct style. And thus started the illustrious career with the first song "''Gayi tu gayi Seeta sati"(Ram Rajya'', 1943).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learningandcreativity.com/manna-dey/ |title=Reference: Manna Dey: A Rare Voice That Excelled In All Music Genres |publisher=Learning and Creativity |date=24 October 2013 |access-date=3 February 2014 |archive-date=29 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129163616/http://www.learningandcreativity.com/manna-dey/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

His songs like "O Prem Diwani Sambhal Ke Chalna" from 1944 film ''Kadambari'' composed by Anil Biswas, "Dil Churaney Ki Liye from Dur Chaley" (1946) composed by Jafar Khurshid, his duets with Amira Bahee like "E Diniya Jara Suney" from ''Kamala'' (1946) and duet song "Aaj Bor Aayee" with [[Meena Kapoor]] from 1947 film ''Chaltey Chaltey'' became chartbusters in respective years. Between 1945 and 1947 many Manna Dey-Rajkumari duets like "Hay Gagan Me Badal Tharey" in 1945 for the film ''Vikaramaditya'', "Aowji Morey" from ''Insaaf'' (1946), all 4 duets from the film ''Geet Govind'' composed by Pandit Indra – "Kit Ho Nando Kumar", "Chorr Sakhi Aaj Laj", "Apney Hi Rang", "Lalit Labang Lata" from ''Geet Govind'' became popular.

He sang for first time songs composed by Sachin Dev Burman, ''Upar Gagan Vishal'' and ''Duniya Ke Logo'' in the 1950 movie ''Mashal'', which became popular and from here his association with S.D.Burman began. Its lyrics were written by [[Kavi Pradeep]]. In 1952, Dey sang for a Bengali and a [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] movie with the same name and storyline, ''Amar Bhupali''. This established him as a leading playback singer in Bengali films and Marathi films as well by 1953.

In the post independence period, after 1947, Manna Dey was regularly used by music composers Anil Biswas, Shankar Rao Vyas, S.K.Pal, S.D.Burman, Khem Chand Prakash, Mohd.Safi from 1947 to 1957. Dey-Anil Biswas combination gave hit numbers from films like ''Gajre'' (1948), ''Hum Bhi Insaan Hai'' (1948), ''Do Sitaare'' (1951), ''Hamdard'' (1953), ''Mahatma Kabir'' (1954), ''Jasoos'' (1957) and ''Pardesi'' (1957). Though Anil Biswas worked with Dey in very few films, their songs remain famous. He recorded his first duet with [[Shamshad Begum]], who was the Hindi female singer most in demand from 1940 to 1961, "Phoolon Ka Swapna" in the films ''Girls School'' (1949) composed by S.K.Pal.

His first duet with the then upcoming singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]] was "Lapat Ke Pot Pahaney Bikral" composed by [[Vasant Desai]] for ''Narsingh Avtar'' (1949), and with [[Kishore Kumar]] it was "Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran" from 1951 film ''Anadolan'' composed by Pannalal Ghosh. His first duet with [[Geeta Dutt]] was "Dhonyo Dhonyo He Ayodh Puri" from the film ''Ram Vivah'' (1949) composed by Shankar Rao Vyas, first duet with [[Tun Tun|Umadevi (Tun Tun)]] was "Hay Ye Hain" from ''Jangal Ka Jaanwar'' (1951) composed by Ghantshala. His first duet with the then struggling singer [[Asha Bhosle]] was "O Raat Gayee Fir Din Aya" from 1953 film ''Bootpolish''.

Manna Dey established his verstality between 1948 and 1954 by singing not only the classical based film songs but also singing such film songs which were fusion of Indian classical music and pop music and by giving classical music concerts. His experimentation with western music too produced many unforgettable melodies resulting in an increase in singing offers in films from 1955. He began singing [[ghazals]] in Hindi films from 1953. He became a music composer in Hindi films when he composed music along with Khemchand Prakash for both ''Shri Ganesh Janma'' (1951) and ''Vishwamitra'' (1952).

===1953–1967===
[[File:Manna Dey.jpg|thumbnail|Manna Dey after Getting [[D.Litt]] degree from [[Rabindra Bharati University]] (May 2004)]]
By 1954, Manna Dey became popular among musical circle across film industries of various Indian languages. He became nationally famous after release of ''[[Do Bigha Zamin]]'' (1953) where two of the songs sung by him and composed by [[Salil Choudhury]] became hits. Salil Choudhury worked with Dey from 1953 to 1992 in Hindi films and made Dey sing even in Bengali and Malayalam films right from the late 1950s to early 1990s. His association with [[Shankar–Jaikishan]] and producer [[Raj Kapoor]] had begun while working for ''[[Awaara|Awara]]'', but their combination became famous while working together for ''[[Boot Polish]]'' in 1954. The trio worked in many films together from 1954 to 1971 whose musical scores were appreciated, irrespective of their box-office fate, like [[Shri 420|''Shree 420'']], ''[[Chori Chori]]'', ''[[Mera Naam Joker]]'', ''[[Awaara]]'', and ''[[Kal Aaj Aur Kal]]''. He also sang for Raj Kapoor in Parvarish, Sriman Satyavadi (both with music by Dattaram), Dil Hi To Hai (music by Roshan), and Abdullah (music by R.D. Burman). The Raj Kapoor- Manna Dey combination produced superhits (both music and film, the only exception being ''Mera Naam Joker'' where the songs were chartbusters but the film was a flop) and was a pair to reckon with. While Mukesh sang the slow pathos for Raj Kapoor, Manna Dey sang the fast peppy ones, the classical numbers, the romantic duets (in case one analyses Manna Dey has sung more than 95% of Raj Kapoor's superhit duets) and the naughty numbers. Manna Dey has the rare distinction of doing playback for both father and son – Raj Kapoor and Randhir Kapoor (In fact Manna Dey later sang for Rishi Kapoor in Zamane ko dikhana hai). [[C. Ramchandra]] worked with Dey very first time in ''Insaniyaat'' in 1955 and then recorded songs with Dey consistently even in the 1960s in films like – ''Tallaq'' (1959), ''Navrang'', ''Paigham'', ''Stree'' (1961), ''Veer Bhimsen'' etc.

In 1956, he sang with a new batch of singers. He recorded his first duets with [[Sudha Malhotra]] "Ghar Ghar Deep Jalao Re" from ''Ayodhyapati'' in 1956, with Binata Chatterjee in the duet "Tum Mile Mil Gaye Karaar" from ''Grand Hotel'' (1956) composed by Suresh Talwar, and then his first duet with Sabita Banerjee in the song "Jamine Hamari Jamana" composed by A.R.Quereshi from ''Laal-E-Yaman'' (1956) and with singer Meena Kapoor in the song "Rim Jhim Jhim Rim Jhim" from [[Journey Beyond Three Seas|Pardesi]] (1957) composed by [[Anil Biswas (composer)|Anil Biswas]].

Dey turned into an independent music composer in Hindi films with ''Maha Poojaa'' in 1954. He sang eighty-three Hindi songs in three years from 1953 to 1955 and his demand increased such that he sang 45 songs in the year 1956. His career reached in peak form when he recorded 95 Hindi songs in single year 1957 and 64 in 1958. His peak period in Hindi film industry is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 where he recorded 758 Hindi songs of which 631 came between 1957 and 1969. He worked extensively with other music directors like [[Naushad]], K.Dutta, Vasant Pawar & Ram, Vasant Desai, [[Ravi (music director)|Ravi]], S.K.Pal, Avinash Vyas, S. N. Tripathi, Sanmukh Babu, Nissar Bazmi, Husanlal Bhagatram, B.N. Bali, Sushanta Banerjee, [[O.P. Nayyar]], G.Ramanathan, [[T. G. Lingappa|T.G.Lingappa]], Nirmal Kumar, [[Ghulam Mohammed (composer)|Ghulam Mohhammed]], Bipin Dutta, Rabin Banerjee, [[Roshan (music director)|Roshan]], Sapan Jagmohan from 1954 to 1968.

New age composers like [[Kalyanji-Anandji]] started recording songs with Manna Dey from 1958 and [[Laxmikant Pyarelal]] from 1964. [[Rahul Dev Burman]] made Manna Dey sing the westernised songs – "Aao Twist Karen" and "Pyar Karta Ja" which became chartbusters in 1965. But the composers who gave Manna Dey consistent popular song numbers in commercially successful films from 1955 to 1969 were [[S.D.Burman]], C.Ramachandra, Ravi, Avinash Vyas, Vasant Desai, Anil Biswas, Salil Choudhury and [[Shankar Jaikishan]]. The solo songs sung by Manna Dey like "Lapak Jhapak Tu Aa Re" from [[Boot Polish (film)|''Boot Polish'']](1954), "O Gori Tori Tu Pyar Ka Sagar Hai" from ''[[Seema (1955 film)|Seema]]''(1955), "Yeh Kahani Hai Diye Aur Toofan Ki" from ''Diya Aur Toofan'' (1956) composed by Vasant Desai, "Humdum Se Gaye" from ''[[Manzil (1960 film)|Manzil]]'' (1960), "Aye Mere Pyare Watan" from ''[[Kabuliwala (1961 film)|Kabuliwala]]'' (1961), "Laga Chunari Mein Daag" from ''Dil Hi Toh Hai'' (1963), classical songs like "Sur Na Saje" from ''Basant Bahar'' (1956), "Kaun Aya Mere Mann" from [[Dekh Kabira Roya (1957 film)|''Dekh Kabira Roya'']] (1957), "Pucho Na Kaise Maine Rain" from ''Meri Surat Teri Aankhen'' (1963), "Jhanak Jhanak Tore Baje Payalia" from ''[[Mere Huzoor]]'' (1965); folk based songs like "Kisi Chilman Se" from ''[[Baat Ek Raat Ki]]'' (1962), "Ae Meri Zohra Jabeen" from ''[[Waqt (1965 film)|Waqt]]'' (1965), "Chalat Musafir Moh Liya" from ''[[Teesri Kasam]]'' (1967), "Aao Aao Sawariya", and duets with Lata like "Masti Bhara Yeh Sama" from ''Parvarish''(1958), "Nain Mile Chain Kahan" from ''Basant Bahar''(1956), "Kehdoji Kehdo Chupaona Pyar" from ''Kismat Ka Khel'' (1956), "Tum Gagan Ke Chandrama" from ''Sati Savitri'' (1964), "Dil Ki Girah" from ''[[Raat Aur Din]]'' (1966), "Chunari Sambhal Gori" from ''[[Baharon Ke Sapne]]'' (1967), were chartbusters in their respective year of release. Credit is also given to Manna Dey for popularising classical based solo and duet songs to the masses like the duet with Lata – "Pritam Daras Dikhao" from ''Chacha Zindabad'' (1959), became a popular song though it was based on classical [[Lalit (raga)|Raag Lalit]]. His rendition of "Kasame Vaade Pyar" from ''[[Upkar]]'' (1967) pictured on [[Pran (actor)|Pran]] and composed by Kalyanji Anandji won accolades for Dey, and was also significant in Pran's career as he began to do positive roles.

Manna Dey gave playback for Raj Kapoor in ''[[Shree 420]]'' (Mud Mud Ke Na Dekh), ''Chori Chori'' (Yeh Raat Bheegi, Jahan Main Jati and Aja Sanam), ''Parvarish'' (Masti bhara hai sama), [[Dil Hi To Hai (1963 film)|''Dil Hi To Hai'']] (Laga chunari mein daag), ''Mera Naam Joker'' (Ae bhai zara dekh ke chalo) and "Ek Paon Chal Raha Hai" from ''[[Kal Aaj Aur Kal]]'' (1971). [[R.D.Burman]] recorded hit songs with Manna Dey regularly from 1965 with films like ''Bhoot Bangla'', ''Gomti Ke Kinare'', ''Chandan Ka Palna'', ''Baharon Ke Sapne'', ''Padosan'', in late 60s. He sang for [[Balraj Sahni]] in many films from 1950 till 1969 and was voice of [[Mehmood Ali|Mehmood]] and [[Anoop Kumar]] in many films from 1960 to 1975.

Among the new breed of singers which emerged after 1956, Manna Dey's duets with [[Suman Kalyanpur]] were popular making them a celebrated team. Their first duet was "Prem Bada Balwan Jagat" from ''Maayaa Nagri'' (1957) composed by B.N.Bali and since then have sung around 45 songs together. Their popular duets include "Tum Jo Aao" from ''Sakhi Robin'' (1962) composed by Robin Bannerjee, "Dil Se Jo Baat" from ''Al Hilal'' (1958) composed by C.Ramachandra, "Na Jane Kahan" from ''Zindagi Aur Khwab'' (1963), "Ye Din Hai Khushi Ke" from ''Jab Se Tumhe Dekha Hai'' (1963) and "Bheegi Hawaon Mein" from [[Shriman Satyawadi|''Shriman Sataywadi'']] (1960)- all 3 composed by Dattaram Wadkar, "Aankh Mein Shokhi" from Reshmi Roomal (1960) composed by Babul, "Aao Hilmil Ke Nacho Re" from [[Jaane-Anjaane|''Jaane Anjaane'']] (1970) composed by Shankar–Jaikishan and "Dil To Dil Hain Phool Bhi" from ''Dafaa 302'' (1975) composed by Laxmikant Pyarelal.

Dey recorded popular duets with [[Mohd.

===1968–1991===
Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey had recorded only 6 songs together until 1968 and all proved to be hits, some of them being "Ye Duniya hai usaki nyari hai" from Sauraksha composed by Bappi Lahiri, "Ye Dosti humnai todenge" from Sholay, "Tubhi Piya Chikara Hoon" and "Tu Jaam Liye Jaa" from ''Bewakoof'' (1960), "Babu Samjho Ishaare" from ''Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi'' (1958) all three composed by S.D. Burman and "Baheta Pani Baheta Jaye" from ''Dhaake Ke Malmal'' composed by C. Ramachandra, "Joyo Joyo Mere Lal" composed by S.K. Pal in 1952 and their first duet together – "Subaho Ki Paheli Kiran" in 1951 from ''Andolan''. In 1968, R.D. Burman brought them together for "Ek Chatur Naar" in Padosan. Reportedly the song "Ek Chatur Naar" (a duet by Kishore Kumar and Manna Dey) from ''Padosan'' (1965) was partly improvised by Kishore Kumar at the time of recording and Manna Dey, determined to show Kishore Kumar how he would sing the duet better (since Kishore had not been trained classically), got into the mood of the song and immortalised "Ek Chatur Naar". Dey recorded around 31 songs with Kishore from 1951 to 1987 and all of them became chartbusters. From 1969, after release of ''Aradhana'', the highest in demand playback singer was Kishore Kumar, so careers of Mukesh, Rafi and Manna Dey were affected and they got lesser number of songs to sing. His peak period as a playback singer is considered to be from 1953 to 1969 and in the year 1969 it seemed that Dey's career in Hindi films would be over due to resurgence of Kishore Kumar but he had an extended peak period till 1976. The song "Tujhe Suraj Kahun Ya Chanda" from ''Ek Phool Do Mali'' in 1969, S.D. Burman composition "Mitwa Mitwa Piya Maine Kya Kiya" from ''Us Paar'' (1974) and his duet with Shailendra Singh from ''[[Bobby (1973 film)|Bobby]]'' – "Na Maangoon Sona Chandi" were a chartbusters in respective years. His song "Sawan Ki Rimjhim Main" was aired in non-film program section in Vividh Bharati and became popular on the radio.

He received a fresh lease of life in his playback singing career from 1971 after Rajesh Khanna allowed music directors to picturise or feature songs sung by Dey in films with Khanna in lead role beginning with Anand, composed by Salil Chowdahry. For Rajesh Khanna, Dey had sung songs "Zindagi kaisi hai paheli" (''Anand'', 1971), "Tum bin jeewan kaisa jeewan" and "Bhor Aaye Gaya Andhera" (''Bawarchi'', 1972), "Nadiya Chale Re" (song sung with Rajesh and Dey), "Hasne ki chah ne kitna mujhe" (''Avishkaar'', 1973) and "Gori tori paijaniya" (''Mehbooba'', 1976). Later in a 2012 interview, Dey said, "I loved the way he picturised music. The success of a song depends upon how an actor picturises it. He was the number one in picturising songs. I will be ever indebted to him."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/it-was-an-honour-to-sing-for-rajesh-khanna-says-manna-dey/1/208954.html |title=It was an honour to sing for Rajesh Khanna: Manna Dey : Celebrities, News |work=India Today |date=18 July 2012 |access-date=25 June 2013 |archive-date=16 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616180931/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/it-was-an-honour-to-sing-for-rajesh-khanna-says-manna-dey/1/208954.html |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1970 to 1983, he recorded around 503 songs used in Hindi films. Thereafter he became selective of the kinds of songs he sings and chose to do less work in Hindi.

Their popular songs were "Mere Pyale Mein" from ''Aamir Garib'' (1974), "Is Ishq Mein Har" from ''Mr. Romeo'' (1974), "Yeh Dosti" from ''Sholay'' (1975), "Duniya Me Jeeney" from ''[[Naukri]]'', "Kamal Hain" from ''Karz'', "Phool Chaahiye Na" from ''Pyas'' (1982) and their last duet was in 1986 film ''Maqqar'' – "Tu Hi Mera Sapna". Salil Chowdhry compositions rendered by Dey from films like ''Ananad'' and ''Anadatta'' became popular as well. Also the trio of Rafi-Kishore-Manna Dey sang together hits like "Tujhme Ishwar, Allah Tujhme" from ''Nanha Farishta'' (1969) and "Band Mutthee" from ''Chalti Ka Naam Zindagi'' (1981).

Burman and with Lata in "Goyakechu Nanche" from ''Manoranjan'' (1974), "Logo Ke Juban Me Apna" from ''Nehla Pe Dehla'', both composed by Pancham.

In 1974, Dey sang along with Lata-Kishore in the song "Goyakechu Nanche" from ''Manoranjan'' (1974) which became a chartbuster in 1974. Manna Dey continued to have hit Hindi songs to his credit from 1971 to 1986, such as "Dulhan Banungi" from ''Who Jo Hasina'' (1983), composed by Raamlaxman and sung with Lata, "Aankhon Ka Salaam Lo" with Lata-Rafi in ''Samraat'', "Dilwaale Dilwaale" from ''Kranti'' (1981), "Yaari Hai Imaan" from ''Zanjeer'', "Ye Duniya Hey Usi Ko" sung with Kishore-Usha from ''Suraksha'' (1979), "Tum Besahara Ho To Kisi" from ''Anurodh'' (1977), "Jo Likha Gaya Hai" from ''Umar Qaid'' (1975), among others. "Sab Kho Diya Sab Pa Liya" from ''Maqqar'' (1986), composed by Rajesh Roshan was the last duet of Lata-Manna Dey for a Hindi film and was a chartbuster. He worked with composers like Laxmikant Pyarelal, Kamlyanji Anadji, Pancham, Bappi Lahiri, Raam Laxman, Sonik Omi, S. Rajeswar Rao, Ravi, Rajesh Roshan extensively from late 70s to 1990 in Hindi films.
