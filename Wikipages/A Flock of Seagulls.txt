'''A Flock of Seagulls''' is an English [[New wave music|new wave]] band formed in [[Liverpool]] in 1979. The group, whose best-known line-up comprised [[Mike Score]], Ali Score, Frank Maudsley and [[Paul Reynolds (musician)|Paul Reynolds]], hit the peak of their chart success in the early 1980s.<ref>{{cite news|first= Lee |last= Zimmerman |title= A Flock of Seagulls: A Legacy of Influence and Insults |newspaper= [[New Times Broward-Palm Beach]] |date= 2 July 2015 |access-date= 13 March 2020 |url= https://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/a-flock-of-seagulls-a-legacy-of-influence-and-insults-7064211}}</ref>

The group had a string of international hit singles including "[[I Ran (So Far Away)]]" (1982), "[[Space Age Love Song]]" (1982), "[[Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)]]" (1982), and "[[The More You Live, the More You Love]]" (1984). Their video for "I Ran (So Far Away)" received airplay on [[MTV]] during the [[Second British Invasion]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Parke |last= Puterbaugh |title= Anglomania: The Second British Invasion |magazine= Rolling Stone |date= 10 November 1983 |access-date= 11 May 2019 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/anglomania-the-second-british-invasion-52016/}}</ref> The band won a [[Grammy Award]] in 1983 for their instrumental "[[D.N.A. (A Flock of Seagulls song)|D.N.A.]]" (1982).

In 2018 the members of the original lineup came together to record an album with the [[Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]] entitled ''[[Ascension (A Flock of Seagulls album)|Ascension]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= A Flock of Seagulls Talk Reunion, Orchestral Album & the Day They Wrote 'I Ran' |magazine= Billboard |date= 23 May 2018 |access-date= 17 April 2020 |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8457384/a-flock-of-seagulls-reunion-new-album-interview}}</ref>

==History==
===1979–1986: Formation and mainstream success===
A Flock of Seagulls was started by Mike Score in late 1979 in Liverpool.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= A Flock of Seagulls: A Flock of Seagulls |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume= 94 |issue= 22 |page= 30 |date= 5 June 1982 |access-date= 5 January 2020 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UyQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT29}}</ref> According to Mike Score, the band's name was taken from the song "Toiler on the Sea" by [[punk rock]] band [[the Stranglers]]  and the book ''[[Jonathan Livingston Seagull]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Walter |last= Bird Jr. |title= Mike Score still flying with Flock of Seagulls |magazine= [[Worcester Magazine]] |date= 26 April 2017 |access-date= 6 June 2018 |url= https://worcestermag.com/2017/04/26/mike-score-still-flying-with-flock-of-seagulls}}</ref> The original line-up of the band featured Mike on lead vocals and keyboards, Ali Score on drums, and Frank Maudsley on bass. Guitarist Willie Woo was added, while Mark Edmondson replaced Ali on drums when the Score brothers fell out.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Flock of Seagulls – Biography |publisher= [[Amoeba Music]] |access-date= 15 June 2016 |url= http://www.amoeba.com/a-flock-of-seagulls/artist/136931/bio}}</ref> Soon afterwards, Edmondson departed to make way for a returning Ali, while teenager [[Paul Reynolds (musician)|Paul Reynolds]], a close friend of Edmondson, replaced Woo at the behest of Maudsley, thus creating the band's classic line-up. The band practised above Mike Score's hair salon,<ref name="DT">{{cite book|first= Dave |last= Thompson |author-link= Dave Thompson (author) |year= 2000 |title= Alternative Rock |publisher= [[Hal Leonard Corporation]] |pages= 141–42 |isbn= 978-0-8793-0607-6 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZHP-r9-eqdAC&pg=PA141}}</ref> and then started playing clubs, eventually signing a recording contract.

They recorded sessions for [[John Peel]]'s show on [[BBC Radio 1]] in May 1981.<ref>{{cite web|title= BBC – Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – 06/05/1980 A Flock of Seagulls |publisher= [[BBC Radio 1]] |access-date= 12 June 2018 |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1981/May06aflockofseagulls/}}</ref> Eventually, under the management of Harry Maguire, Tommy Crossan, and Mick Rossi, all directors of Checkmount Limited, they began to release singles through [[Jive Records]]. The group released their debut single "[[Talking (A Flock of Seagulls song)|Talking]]" (produced by Nelson), on [[Bill Nelson (musician)|Bill Nelson]]'s Cocteau label. They were then signed to major label Jive, distributed through CBS records, where they released their second single "[[Telecommunication (song)|Telecommunication]]". The single was also produced by Nelson and became a club hit. Their third release was the EP "Modern Love is Automatic". Originally released as a 4 track EP on both 7" and 12", the 12" edition was soon reissued, adding "Telecommunication". This 5 track EP was also their first release in the U.S.<ref name="DT"/> In 1982, the group's fourth single "[[I Ran (So Far Away)]]", produced by [[Mike Howlett]], the former bass player of the band [[Gong (band)|Gong]], became a worldwide hit, reaching number 1 in Australia and the Top 10 in both the US and New Zealand. Their [[A Flock of Seagulls (album)|debut album]] and single "[[Space Age Love Song]]" were both successful.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Andy |last= Greene |title= Where Are They Now? 1982's Biggest Pop Acts – A Flock of Seagulls |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |date= 8 August 2012 |access-date= 22 March 2015 |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/pictures/where-are-they-now-1982s-biggest-pop-acts-20120808/a-flock-of-seagulls-0758690}}</ref> The track "[[D.N.A. (A Flock of Seagulls song)|D.N.A.]]" won a [[Grammy Award]] in [[25th Annual Grammy Awards|1983]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Instrumental Performance|Best Rock Instrumental Performance]].<ref>{{cite web|title= Artist: Flock of Seagulls |website= Grammy.com |access-date= 27 April 2019 |url= https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/flock-seagulls}}</ref> In late 1982, the band finally found major success in their home country with "[[Wishing (If I Had a Photograph of You)]]", the first single from their next album ''[[Listen (A Flock of Seagulls album)|Listen]]'', which reached the Top 10.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Flock of Seagulls |publisher= [[Official Charts Company]] |access-date= 6 November 2013 |url= http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19502/A%20FLOCK%20OF%20SEAGULLS/}}</ref> Later, the band was praised for having broken the ground for other musical acts during the advent of the video music area,<ref>{{cite web|first= Charles R. |last= Cross |author-link= Charles R. Cross |title= Never mind the hair bands, here's a Flock of Seagulls! |work= [[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date= 30 August 2001 |access-date= 6 November 2013 |url= http://www.salon.com/2001/08/30/eighties/}}</ref> but as it turned out, 1982 was the peak year of their commercial and critical success.

On Memorial Day Weekend, Saturday, 28 May 1983, A Flock of Seagulls performed at the [[US Festival]] along with [[Oingo Boingo]], [[Men at Work]], and others.<ref>{{cite news|first= Ben |last= Wener |title= The Forgotten Festival: Remembering US '82 and '83 as Steve Wozniak's dream bash turns 30 |newspaper= [[Orange County Register]] |date= 31 August 2012 |access-date= 7 June 2018 |url= https://www.ocregister.com/2012/08/31/the-forgotten-festival-remembering-us-82-and-83-as-steve-wozniaks-dream-bash-turns-30/}}</ref> Three more singles were released from ''Listen'' in 1983, including a re-recorded version of their debut single "(It's Not Me) Talking", but they were only minor successes in the UK and abroad. Faced with disappointment, the group changed direction from their [[science fiction]] themes and produced a more conceptual emotion-based third album in 1984 called ''[[The Story of a Young Heart]]'', with "[[The More You Live, the More You Love]]" as the lead single. Despite heavy rotation on [[MTV]] and other music video shows at that time, the single was only moderately successful, and the album's other two singles – "Never Again (The Dancer)" and "Remember David" (released only in a few European countries) – did not make any headway. Faced with sliding sales and a loss of direction, the band continued to consider their options whilst touring. During this period, Paul Reynolds left the band, and was replaced by Gary Steadman (from [[Classix Nouveaux]]).<ref name="Bio"/> Keyboardist Chris Chryssaphis was added at the same time to augment their sound.<ref name="Bio"/> Both stayed in the band for the recording and release of next the album–''[[Dream Come True (A Flock of Seagulls album)|Dream Come True–]]''but departed once the tour had ended. The album was released in 1985 in the UK and 1986 in the US, and failed to chart, thus leading to the dissolving of the band until 1988.<ref name="Bio"/>

===1988–present: Reformation and the current era===
In 1988 the band performed in [[Philadelphia]] with Mike Score accompanied by local musicians Ed Berner and Dave Maerz on guitar, bass guitarist Mike Radcliffe, keyboardist Mike Railton, and drummers Kaya Pryor and Jonte Wilkins.<ref>{{cite news|first= Jonathan |last= Takiff |title= Local Seagulls Join The Flock |newspaper= [[Philadelphia Daily News]] |date= 18 November 1988 |access-date= 15 June 2016 |url= http://articles.philly.com/1988-11-18/news/26246682_1_seagulls-ed-berner-culture-club}}</ref> This lineup expanded the following year to include drummer [[Michael Marquart|Mike Marquart]];<ref>{{cite web|first= Martin C. |last= Strong |author-link= Martin C. Strong |title= A Flock of Seagulls |access-date= 15 June 2016 |url= http://thegreatrockbible.com/portfolio-item/flock-seagulls-biography/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Malcolm |last= Venable |title= Low-key musician doesn't need to be a big rock star |newspaper= [[The Virginian-Pilot]] |date= 13 October 2009 |access-date= 15 June 2016 |url= http://hamptonroads.com/2009/10/lowkey-musician-doesn%E2%80%99t-need-be-big-rock-star}}</ref> but was then reduced to a five-piece band consisting of Score, Berner, Pryor, Radcliffe, and Railton; it was this lineup which released the single "Magic" that same year.

In 1994, the band's lineup changed again; this time to a formation consisting of Score, Berner, and new recruits A.J. Mazzetti (drums) and Dean Pichette (bass guitar). They recorded the album ''[[The Light at the End of the World (A Flock of Seagulls album)|The Light at the End of the World]]'' in 1996, but it failed to chart. Drummer John Walker later replaced Mazzetti.

In 1998, Berner, Walker, and Pichette departed the band and were replaced by Joe Rodriguez, Darryl Sons, and Rob Wright, respectively. In 1999, the band re-recorded the [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] song "[[This Used to Be My Playground]]" for the 2000 Madonna tribute album ''The World's Greatest 80s Tribute to Madonna''. In November 2003, the original lineup of Mike and Ali Score, Paul Reynolds and Frank Maudsley reunited for a one-off performance on the VH1 series ''[[Bands Reunited]]''. In September 2004, they reformed again and did a brief tour in the United States. Though the tour continued to be advertised as the "original lineup", later shows no longer included the original band, but was Mike Score's continuation of the newer band; which by this point consisted of Score, Rodriguez, and new recruits Michael Brahm (drums), and Pando (bass guitar). In 2005, this version of the group starred in the American version of the entertainment show ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me Baby, One More Time]]'', where they performed "I Ran" and a cover of [[Ryan Cabrera]]'s song, "[[On the Way Down|On The Way Down]]" for a chance to have $20,000 donated to a charity of their choice.

In June 2011, Frank Maudsley and Paul Reynolds performed at [[Croxteth Hall|Croxteth Park]] music festival in Liverpool, under the name 'A Flock of Seagulls'.<ref>{{cite web|title= 80's Band A Flock of Seagulls top Croxteth Free Music Festival lineup |website= LLTV |date= 25 June 2011 |access-date= 22 August 2019 |url= http://liverpool-live.tv/uncategorized/80s-band-a-flock-of-seagulls-top-croxteth-free-music-festival-lineup/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Jade |last= Wright |title= Jade Wright recommends . . .Croxteth Park Free Music Festival |newspaper= [[Liverpool Echo]] |date= 10 June 2011 |access-date= 22 August 2019 |url= https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/whats-on/music/jade-wright-recommends---3372111}}</ref>

On 4 February 2013, Mike Score indicated via his YouTube account that he was pursuing his solo career. He released the singles "All I Wanna Do" in February 2013,<ref>{{cite web|first= Paul |last= Waller |title= Flock-of-Seagulls/Mike-Score |work= Penny Black Music |date= 24 January 2013 |access-date= 7 June 2018 |url= http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/magsitepages/Article/6825/Flock-of-Seagulls/Mike-Score/}}</ref> and "Somebody Like You" in January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Flock of Seagulls' Mike Score Releases New Single 'Somebody Like You' |website= [[Broadway Worldwide]] |date= 29 January 2014 |access-date= 12 June 2018 |url= http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/A-Flock-of-Seagulls-Mike-Score-Releases-New-Single-Somebody-Like-You-20140129}}</ref> In late July 2013, after a Southern California performance, Mike Score told the Los Angeles Daily News that the band's rented van that contained $70,000 of equipment and the hard drives that stored tracks for his solo album ''[[Zeebratta]]'' were stolen from a Comfort Inn.<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Flock of Seagulls Tour Van Stolen with Instruments, New Album Inside |magazine= Billboard |agency= [[Associated Press]] |date= 23 July 2013 |access-date= 7 June 2018 |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/4312296/flock-of-seagulls-tour-van-stolen-with-instruments-new-album-inside/}}</ref> While this delayed the album's release, he was able to reconstruct it with music files from his home in Florida. ''Zeebratta'' was finally released on 1 March 2014.

Kevin Rankin replaced Brahm on drums in 2016, and Gordon Deppe—from the Canadian band [[Spoons (band)|Spoons]]—replaced Joe Rodriguez in December 2017.

On 3 May 2018, it was announced that the band's original four members were reuniting to record a new album titled ''[[Ascension (A Flock of Seagulls album)|Ascension]]'', their first studio recording since 1984.<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Mackenzie |last= Cummings-Grady |title= A Flock of Seagulls Announces New Album 'Ascension' |magazine= Billboard |date= 3 May 2018 |access-date= 27 May 2018 |url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8453567/a-flock-of-seagulls-announces-new-album-reunion}}</ref> Featuring the [[Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]], it would be a 12-track album composed of new renditions of their previous hits alongside one new song.<ref>{{cite web|title= Fully Reunited, A Flock of Seagulls Readying New LP 'Ascension,' with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra |work= Rock Cellar Magazine |date= 7 May 2018 |access-date= 2 June 2018 |url= https://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2018/05/07/flock-of-seagulls-reunion-new-album/ |url-status= dead |archive-date= 12 June 2018 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20180612141111/https://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2018/05/07/flock-of-seagulls-reunion-new-album/}}</ref> The video for "Space Age Love Song" premiered on YouTube on 6 June,<ref>{{cite magazine|title= Magnet Exclusive: Premiere of A Flock of Seagulls' "Space Age Love Song" Video |magazine= [[Magnet (magazine)|Magnet]] |date= 6 June 2018 |access-date= 7 June 2018 |url= http://magnetmagazine.com/2018/06/06/magnet-exclusive-premiere-flock-seagulls-space-age-love-song-video/}}</ref> and an EP featuring five versions of the song was released digitally two days later.<ref>{{cite web|first= Julia |last= Gray |title= A Flock of Seagulls' Original Lineup Remade Their Best Song for First Recording in 34 Years |website= [[Stereogum]] |date= 7 June 2018 |access-date= 8 June 2018 |url= https://www.stereogum.com/2000470/a-flock-of-seagulls-original-lineup-remade-their-best-song-for-first-recording-in-34-years/video/}}</ref> The album was available in physical form in late June 2018, then released digitally and in stores on 6 July.<ref>{{cite web|title= A Flock of Seagulls – Ascension |website= AllMusic |access-date= 8 July 2018 |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/ascension-mw0003184896}}</ref> In December 2018, the orchestral version of "I Ran" was released as a single.

On 10 May 2021 the band announced through their social networks that they would release a new orchestral album, again together with the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra, which would be called ''[[String Theory (A Flock of Seagulls album)|String Theory]]''. This album features other of the band's biggest hits, such as "Messages", "Remember David" and "Say You Love Me", the latter being the lead single. The album was released on 20 August 2021.<ref>{{cite news|title= A Flock of Seagulls anuncia novo álbum "String Theory" |publisher= A Rádio Rock – 89,1 FM |date= 10 May 2021 |access-date= 23 July 2021 |url= https://www.radiorock.com.br/2021/05/10/a-flock-of-seaguls-anuncia-novo-album-string-theory/ |language= pt-br}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Chris |last= Brandon |title= A Flock of Seagulls announce new album, String Theory |website= Synthpop Fanatic |date= 12 May 2021 |access-date= 23 July 2021 |url= https://www.synthpopfanatic.com/news/a-flock-of-seagulls-announce-new-album-string-theory/}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first= Jason |last= Price |title= A Flock of Seagulls Return with "Say You Love Me" Single from Their New Album 'String Theory' |website= Icon vs. Icon |date= 28 June 2021 |access-date= 1 July 2021 |url= https://www.iconvsicon.com/2021/06/28/a-flock-of-seagulls-return-with-say-you-love-me-single-from-their-new-album-string-theory/}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Owing to their memorable and unusual style and appearance, A Flock of Seagulls are sometimes referred to with ironic appreciation. The ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' wrote: "Of course, everyone remembers this group now for singer Mike Score's ridiculous back-combed haircut and the fact that they are mentioned in ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''. So now they're kind of cool, but in the early 1980s it was a different story."<ref>{{cite magazine|title= 252–281: The '80s |magazine= 501 Lost Songs |page= 53 |publisher= [[NME]] |year= 2011}}</ref> Additionally, the band was featured on Viacom's [[VH1]] and Sony's BMG Legacy Recordings' 2006 revival CD series and multi-platform marketing campaign, "We Are the 80's".<ref>{{cite magazine|first= Michael |last= Paoletta |title= Making the Brand: An '80s Revival |magazine= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= 22 July 2006 |volume= 118 |issue= 29 |page= 13 |issn= 0006-2510 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KxYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA13}}</ref> In a 2007 article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', Alfred Hickling described the group as "dreadful", and unfavourably compared them to new wave peers [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark|OMD]] and other Liverpool acts of the time.<ref name="EH">{{cite news|first= Alfred |last= Hickling |title= The Electric Hills |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |date= 19 March 2007 |access-date= 5 November 2013 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/19/theatre1}}</ref>

Their dramatic style has drawn much criticism and parody, but the band has also been recognized as a pioneering act, capturing the spirit of their time, particularly with the guitar work of Paul Reynolds and sonically multi-layered hits such as "Space Age Love Song," "Telecommunication," and "Modern Love Is Automatic".{{CN|date=October 2021}} The band also is noted for creating a successful [[concept album]], their debut, which alludes to an alien invasion of earth.<ref>{{cite book|first= Janell R. |last= Duxbury |year= 1988 |title= Shakespeare Meets the Backbeat: Literary Allusion in Rock Music |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis]]}}</ref> Billboard writer [[Robert Christgau]] applauded their "mechanical lyrics, about a mechanical end of the world," while noting the "aural pleasure" of both the band's debut album and the follow-up.<ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Christgau |author-link= Robert Christgau |title= A Flock of Seagulls |series= Christgau's Consumer Guide |newspaper= [[The Village Voice]] |date= 30 November 1982 |access-date= 6 August 2014 |url= http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv7-83.php}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first= Robert |last= Christgau |title= A Flock of Seagulls: Listen |series= Christgau's Consumer Guide |newspaper= [[The Village Voice]] |date= 26 July 1983 |access-date= 6 August 2014 |url= http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv11b-82.php}}</ref>

The video for "I Ran" was low budget (even for the time) but enjoyed enormous success, and is well-remembered in part because [[MTV]] played it frequently.<ref>{{cite book|first= MaryAnn |last= Janosik |year= 2006 |title= The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Rock History: The video generation, 1981–1990 |publisher= [[Greenwood Publishing Group|Greenwood Press]] |isbn= 978-0-3133-2943-2 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eSIKAQAAMAAJ}}</ref>
