'''Over-the-Rhine''' (often abbreviated as '''OTR''') is a [[neighborhood]] in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio, United States. Historically, Over-the-Rhine has been a working-class neighborhood. It is among the largest, most intact urban [[Historic districts in the United States|historic district]]s in the United States.<ref name=guide>Over-the-Rhine Foundation. [http://www.otrfoundation.org/OTR_Architecture.htm Guide to OTR Architecture]. Accessed on 2009-08-13.</ref>

==Etymology==
The neighborhood's name comes from the predominantly [[Germans|German]] immigrants who developed the area in the mid-19th century. Many walked to work across bridges over the [[Miami and Erie Canal]], which separated the area from downtown Cincinnati. The canal was [[nickname]]d "the Rhine" in reference to the river [[Rhine]] in [[Germany]], and the newly settled area north of the canal as "Over the Rhine".<ref name="otr_foundation_history" /><ref name="kenny1875pg130">Kenny (1875), pg. 130.</ref> In German, the district was called ''über den Rhein''.

An early reference to the canal as "the Rhine" appears in the 1853 book ''White, Red, Black'', in which traveler [[Ferenc Pulszky]] wrote, "The Germans live all together across the Miami Canal, which is, therefore, here jocosely called the 'Rhine.' "<ref>{{Cite book

He noted, "Germans and Americans alike love to call the district 'Over the Rhine.'&nbsp;"<ref name="kenny1875pg129">Kenny (1875), pg. 129.</ref> 

Eventually, the canal was drained and capped by Central Parkway; the resulting tunnel was to be used for the now-defunct [[Cincinnati Subway]] project.

==History==
{{Main|History of Over-the-Rhine}}

Built in the nineteenth century during a period of extensive [[Germans|German]] immigration, Over-the-Rhine changed as many residents moved to the suburbs following World War II. The city and area had lost many of the industrial jobs that once supported its workers. By the end of the century, the area was noted for its poverty. Residents united and created many life-saving organizations.<ref name="otr_foundation_history">Over-the-Rhine Foundation. [http://www.otrfoundation.org/history.php OTR History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090528015041/http://www.otrfoundation.org/history.php |date=2009-05-28 }}. Accessed on June 13, 2009</ref> Following social unrest in 2001, the neighborhood has since been the focus of millions of dollars of redevelopment.

==Geography==
[[File:Over-the-Rhine context map.png|300px|thumb|left|Over-the-Rhine and its surroundings]]

Over-the-Rhine, one of the largest, most intact urban historic districts in the United States,<ref name=guide /> has several districts. The Northern Liberties<ref name="FMO">[http://www.findlaymarket.org/history/ Market History | Findlay Market of Cincinnati, Ohio<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> and the [[Over-the-Rhine Brewery District|Brewery District]]<ref>[http://www.otrbrewerydistrict.org/projects_masterplan.php OTR Brewery District | Cincinnati, OH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> are north of Liberty Street. South of Liberty are the Gateway Quarter and [[Pendleton, Cincinnati|Pendelton]].

===The Washington Park Area===
In recent years, developers have renamed this portion of Over-the-Rhine as "'''The Gateway Quarter'''". This area has been the focal point of gentrification, which has displaced African Americans and low-income residents. More than 1,000 African Americans left this area between 2000 and 2010, and by 2012 it had become a predominantly white, wealthy and exclusive section of the neighborhood.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Econocide: Elimination of the Urban Poor|last=Skirtz|first=Alice|publisher=NASW Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-87101-424-5}}</ref>

===The Brewery District===
North of Liberty Street sat the heart of Cincinnati's beer brewing industry.<ref>[http://www.otrbrewerydistrict.org/ OTR Brewery District | Cincinnati, OH<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Christian Moerlein established his first brewing company in Over-the-Rhine in 1853. Eventually the [[Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.]] became the city's largest brewery and expanded into the national market. At its height the brewery occupied three entire city blocks. Prohibition brought an end to the company in the 1920s.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://irhine.com/index.jsp?page=district_brew |title=Over-the-Rhine, Cincinnati, OH - iRhine.com - Brewery District<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2010-12-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713060059/http://www.irhine.com/index.jsp?page=district_brew |archive-date=2011-07-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2010 the revived [[Christian Moerlein Brewing Co.]] began brewing beer in the Brewery District once again.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/print-edition/2010/12/17/christian-moerlein-brews-new.html | first=Jon | last=Newberry | title=Christian Moerlein brews new 'Arnold's' beer in OTR | date=2010-12-17}}</ref>

===North of Liberty Street===
This area of the neighborhood has been relatively untouched by recent gentrification efforts and may resemble historic OTR better than other areas.<ref name="Bridging the Economic Divide" />

In the late 1820s, English writer [[Frances Milton Trollope|Fanny Trollope]], mother of [[Anthony Trollope]], lived in the Mohawk area, which today is considered part of Over-the-Rhine.<ref name=Trollope>[http://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10345/pg10345-images.html Trollope, Fanny, ''Domestic Manners of the Americans'', Ch. 12.]</ref> The acerbic portrayal of Americans of that period in her book ''[[Domestic Manners of the Americans]]'' is based in part on her interactions with the rough-hewn residents of the area.

Until 1849, today's Liberty Street, then called Northern Row, was the corporation line forming Cincinnati's northern boundary. The area north of Northern Row was not subject to municipal law and was called "The Northern Liberties". In 1955, the city decided to widen Liberty Street to connect with Reading Road as an east-west crosstown access point for the interstate highway system. Buildings on the south side of the street were demolished and the street was widened from two to five lanes. As of 2019, efforts are underway to narrow Liberty Street to bridge the gap between these halves of the neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Liberty Street Road Diet – UrbanCincy|url=https://www.urbancincy.com/tag/liberty-street-road-diet/|access-date=2020-10-22|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Gentrification==
===Over-the-Rhine Neighborhood Revitalization===
Over-the-Rhine, the site of the [[Cincinnati riots of 2001|2001 Cincinnati riots]], became the city's most dangerous neighborhood by 2009. It has since seen intensive gentrification efforts.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/what-works-cincinnati-ohio-over-the-rhine-crime-neighborhood-turnaround-city-urban-revitalization-213969|title=How Cincinnati Salvaged the Nation's Most Dangerous Neighborhood|work=POLITICO Magazine|access-date=2018-11-27|language=en}}</ref>  Private development corporations and city officials have begun to address the problems that come with a neighborhood with low employment and high crime rates.

===Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation===
The [[Cincinnati Center City Development Corporation]] (3CDC) is a private, [[non-profit]] real-estate development and finance organization focused on revitalizing Cincinnati's urban core with the city government and local corporations. Its work is focused on the central business district and in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. The organization is widely credited with revitalizing OTR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/06/what-works-cincinnati-ohio-over-the-rhine-crime-neighborhood-turnaround-city-urban-revitalization-213969|title=How Cincinnati Salvaged the Nation's Most Dangerous Neighborhood|last=Woodard|first=Colin|website=POLITICO Magazine|language=en|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref> The organization began as a full-service real estate developer, but has since branched out and produces more than 1,000 events per year<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/02/09/3cdc-really-wants-you-have-fun-downtown/97280348/|title=How 3CDC built a local events empire|website=Cincinnati.com|language=en|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref> at the four civic spaces it manages: Fountain Square, Washington Park, Ziegler Park and Memorial Hall.

In July 2003, 3CDC was formed by former mayor of Cincinnati [[Charlie Luken]] and other corporate community members. This was a result of a recommendation by a City of Cincinnati Economic Development Task Force. Most funds are gathered through corporate contributions. In 2004, 3CDC accepted responsibility for overseeing Cincinnati New Markets Fund and Cincinnati Equity Fund. As of May 2018, those funds total over $250 million and have resulted in over $1.3 billion<ref name="bizj_3CDC">{{Cite web

Over-the-Rhine has been praised for its collection of historic architecture.

Most of Over-the-Rhine's ornate brick buildings were built by German immigrants from 1865 to the 1880s.<ref name="Life Breathes Anew in Riot-Scarred Area" /> The architecture of Over-the-Rhine reflects the diverse styles of the late nineteenth century&mdash;[[Vernacular architecture|simple vernacular]], [[Greek Revival architecture|muted Greek Revival]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] and [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]].<ref name="11 Most Endangered">National Trust for Historic Preservation, [http://www.preservationnation.org/travel-and-sites/sites/midwest-region/over-the-rhine-neighborhood.html 11 Most Endangered: Over-the-Rhine Neighborhood].

===New construction===
Noted [[Indianapolis]] architect [[Evans Woollen III]] and his architectural firm of [[Woollen, Molzan and Partners]] helped redevelop the historic neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s. Woollen designed the Over-the-Rhine Pilot Center (1972–84), a group of four [[Modern architecture|modern]], mixed-use buildings within a two-block area.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Philip J.
