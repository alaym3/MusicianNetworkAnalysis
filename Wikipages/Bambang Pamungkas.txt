==Club career==

Bambang played for several clubs around his hometown as a youth, before beginning his senior career with [[Persija Jakarta]]. He was the club's top goalscorer in 1999–2000 [[Liga Indonesia Premier Division|Liga Indonesia]] with 24 goals. In 2000, he joined [[EHC Hoensbroek|EHC Norad]] in the Dutch Third Division. But after only 4 months he returned to Persija, the only Indonesian club he ever played for.

Bambang helped his club to win the Liga Indonesia in [[2001 Liga Indonesia Premier Division|2001]], and he was awarded the accolade of that season's best player. Persija Jakarta narrowly missed out on winning the championship again in [[2004 Liga Indonesia Premier Division|2004]] by one point. The following season Persija reached the [[2005 Liga Indonesia Premier Division|2005 final]], but lost 2–3 to [[Persipura Jayapura]].

Shortly afterwards Bambang accepted an offer to play in the Malaysian Football League with [[Selangor FA]], along with national teammate [[Elie Aiboy]]. In his first season in Malaysia he won the [[Premier League Malaysia]], [[FA Cup Malaysia]], and [[Malaysia Cup]], and became the league's top-scorer with 23 goals in 24 matches. During two seasons in Malaysia he scored 63 goals in four competitions: [[Malaysia Premier League]], [[Malaysia Super League]], [[FA Cup Malaysia]], [[Malaysia Cup]], [[AFC Cup]]. Despite having scored a total of 178 goals in [[Liga Indonesia]], like Singaporean forward [[Indra Sahdan Daud]], Bambang lost his place in the nation team to foreign-born talent.

In 2008, despite interests from English club [[Derby County]], he opted to stay in Indonesia.<ref>http://www.eyefootball.com/mobile/4572/Derby-Indonesian-star.html</ref>

In 2010, he had a trial at [[FC Ingolstadt 04]], but failed to secure a contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2010/July/29/phoenix-sign-argentine-midfielder-cornejo/ |title=Phoenix sign Argentine midfielder Cornejo |publisher=Soccerway |date=29 July 2010 |access-date=26 April 2012}}</ref>

On 9 December 2013, he signed a one-year contract with Pelita Bandung Raya.

On 3 December 2014, he moved back to [[Persija Jakarta]].<ref>{{cite web|title=RESMI: Bambang Pamungkas Pulang Ke Persija Jakarta|url=http://www.goal.com/id-ID/news/1391/indonesia-super-league/2014/12/03/6722242/resmi-bambang-pamungkas-pulang-ke-persija-jakarta|access-date=4 December 2014|language=id}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.espnfc.com/blog/football-asia/153/post/2190363/bambangs-return-to-persija-turns-the-clock-back-for-indonesian-fans |title=Bambang's return to Persija turns the clock back for Indonesian fans |publisher=[[ESPN]] |first=Jason |last=Dasey |date=11 December 2014 |access-date=11 December 2014}}</ref>

On 17 December 2019, he announced his retirement from professional football after 19 years of career.
His last game was a 1–3 victory of [[Persija Jakarta]] to [[Kalteng Putra|Kalteng Putra F.C.]] in the Tuah Pahoe Stadium. On 17 January 2020, a month after Bambang announced his retirement, he was chosen to become the manager of [[Persija Jakarta]].

==International career==
In 1998 Bambang's international career began when he was selected to play for the Indonesian youth team; his tally of seven goals in the Asian Cup U-19 Group V made him the competition's top scorer. He made his senior international debut the following year in a friendly match against [[Lithuania national football team|Lithuania]], in which he scored one goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bambangpamungkas20.com/bepe/karir/timnas |title=Bambang Pamungkas :[Official Website&#93; |publisher=Bambangpamungkas20.com |access-date=26 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122205747/http://www.bambangpamungkas20.com/bepe/karir/timnas |archive-date=22 November 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In the [[2002 Tiger Cup]], Bambang was the top scorer with 8 goals, but an injury ruled him out of the Indonesian squad for the [[2004 Tiger Cup|2004 event]]. He scored twice in the [[2008 AFF Suzuki Cup]], once against [[Myanmar national football team|Myanmar]] and once against [[Cambodia national football team|Cambodia]]. In [[2010 AFF Suzuki Cup]] Bambang scored two goals in a match against Thailand, both from penalty kicks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_739698/Indonesia_2_Thailand_1_-_Bambang_double_ends_Thai_hopes |title=Indonesia 2 Thailand 1&nbsp;– Bambang double ends Thai hopes |publisher=Affsuzukicup.com |date=7 December 2010 |access-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303213002/http://www.affsuzukicup.com/_webapp_739698/Indonesia_2_Thailand_1_-_Bambang_double_ends_Thai_hopes |archive-date=3 March 2012}}</ref> He has scored a total of 12 goals in the [[AFF Championship|ASEAN Football Championship]], making him the 5th-highest goalscorer in [[AFF Championship|ASEAN Football Championship]] history.
