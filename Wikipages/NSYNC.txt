==History==
===1995–1997: Formation and debut===
[[File:'N Sync Logo.svg|thumb|280px|NSYNC's [[wordmark]] logo]]
[[Lou Pearlman]] was introduced to [[Chris Kirkpatrick]] by a mutual acquaintance in 1995 and was impressed by his talent, so he immediately picked him up to talk about starting a group. Pearlman promised that he would help finance him if Chris could form a group of other young male singers to join him. Chris Kirkpatrick jumped on the opportunity and made some calls, eventually finding [[Justin Timberlake]] (who had been on the TV show ''[[The All New Mickey Mouse Club|The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' along with [[JC Chasez]]'')'' through a talent agent and contacted him about joining his vocal group.

After the end of ''The Mickey Mouse Club'' in 1994, Chasez attempted to pursue a music career in [[Los Angeles]], but after feeling cheated, decided to return home to [[Maryland]].<ref name="RSWeird" /> On his drive back, he stopped at Timberlake's house in [[Memphis, Tennessee]] where the two wrote demos together.<ref name="RSWeird">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/n-sync-weird-scenes-inside-the-glitter-factory-245124/|title='N Sync: Weird Scenes Inside the Glitter Factory|last=Bozza|first=Anthony|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=March 30, 2000|access-date=March 29, 2020}}</ref> Chasez and Timberlake eventually relocated to [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] while continuously writing songs and demo tracks with Robin Wiley, a songwriter and vocal coach on ''The Mickey Mouse Club''.<ref name="RSWeird" /> After Timberlake received a phone call from Kirkpatrick, he decided to join the group, recommending Chasez in the process, who was back home in Maryland saving up to return to Nashville.<ref name="RSWeird"/> The trio decided to venture in [[Orlando, Florida]] to search for a [[baritone]], where they encountered [[Joey Fatone]], who knew Kirkpatrick from their time working at [[Universal Studios Florida]]. The group finally recruited Jason Galasso as their [[Bass (voice type)|bass]] singer after several auditions.<ref name="RSWeird"/> NSYNC created their name after Timberlake's mother commented on how "in sync" the group's singing voices were.<ref>{{cite web|title='N Sync Discusses Their Rise to Stardom|url=http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0101/09/lkl.00.html|url-status=live|access-date=September 2, 2013|publisher=[[CNN]]}}</ref> The group's name is also a play on the last letter of each of the initial members' names: Justi'''N''', Chri'''S''', Joe'''Y''', Jaso'''N'''<!-- Do not change this into Lance's name as that contradicts the cited source from Gazette Review. -->, and J'''C'''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://gazettereview.com/2016/12/happened-chris-kirkpatrick-news-updates/|title=What Happened to Chris Kirkpatrick&nbsp;– Where's The NSYNC Member Now?

After several weeks of rehearsals, the group set up a showcase and began planning to officially sign with Pearlman's Trans Continental Label. However, at the last minute, Galasso dropped out. He was not fond of the group's musical direction, claiming that being a [[teen idol]] was never a goal of his.<ref name="Jason">{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/59733/episode_about.jhtml|title=VH1's Driven's *NSYNC Episode Summary|publisher=VH1|access-date=January 4, 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071223010856/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/59733/episode_about.jhtml| archive-date= December 23, 2007<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> In need of a bass, the group auditioned several people without success. Timberlake eventually called his vocal coach, who suggested a 16-year-old from [[Mississippi]] named [[Lance Bass]]. Bass flew to Orlando to audition and was immediately accepted into the group. He was nicknamed "Lansten" so they could keep the name 'NSYNC.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/513952/n-syncs-james-lance-lansten-bass.jhtml|title= 'N Sync's James Lance "Lansten" Bass|first=Frank|last=Tortorici|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=May 4, 1999}}</ref> From there, Pearlman set the five boys up in a house in Orlando, Florida, where they rehearsed constantly, learning dance routines and vocal parts, and working on promotion for their first public performance at [[Pleasure Island (Walt Disney World)|Pleasure Island]] on October 22, 1995. Pearlman hired [[Johnny Wright (music manager)|Johnny Wright]] to manage the group, despite also managing the Backstreet Boys. NSYNC sent him a four-song demo-tape including "I'll Be Back for More" and "We Can Work It Out", which impressed him. The group performed for him and a group of [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] executives. Although the record company had some concerns with the band's name and Bass's dancing abilities (which eventually improved), they agreed to sign the group to [[Ariola Records|BMG Ariola Munich]] with Wright as their manager.<ref name="Jason" />

After being signed to BMG Ariola Munich, the group was sent to Sweden to begin working on their debut album with the help of producers such as [[Denniz Pop]], [[Max Martin]] and [[Andreas Carlsson]]. The album's official [[lead single]], "[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]", was released in Germany on October 7, 1996, and entered the top 10 in Germany on November 18, 1996.<ref name="CHARTS-DEUTSCHLAND:Single Top 100 (18.11.1996)">{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/charts/single/for-date-848304000000|title=CHARTSDEUTSCHLAND: Single Top 100 (18.11.1996)|publisher=Charts.de|language=de}}</ref> With a record deal finally secured, the boys began touring first in German-speaking countries and later in other European and Asian territories.<ref name="RSWeird"/> Their [['N Sync (album)|self-titled debut album]] was initially released by BMG Ariola Munich on May 26, 1997, in Germany, and peaked at number one in the second week after its release.<ref name="CHARTS-DEUTSCHLAND:Album Top 100 (09.06.1997)">{{cite web|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/charts/album/for-date-865839600000|title=ChartsDeutschland: Album Top 100 (09.06.1997)|publisher=Charts.de|language=de}}</ref> The group soon became an overnight success throughout much of Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=N Sync Pictures, biography, Discography, Filmography, News, Ringtones, Videos|url=http://www.starpulse.com/Music/*NSYNC/Biography/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080608073922/http://www.starpulse.com/Music/N_Sync/|archive-date=8 June 2008|access-date=|website=Starpulse.com|publisher=}}</ref> The album also charted successfully in both Switzerland and Austria eventually selling 820,000 units in GSA (Germany, Switzerland, Austria) region and Eastern Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url =http://www.swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=%27N+Sync&titel=%27N+Sync&cat=a|title=*NSYNC&nbsp;– *NSYNC (ALBUM)|publisher=Hung Medien|access-date=May 12, 2010}}</ref><ref name="N Sync's Inderect Path to the Top">{{cite book|last1=Pride|first1=Dominic|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nw4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA7-IA5|title='N Sync's Indirect Path to the Top|last2=Paoletta|first2=Michael|date=March 20, 1999|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|pages=6, 84|access-date=May 12, 2010}}</ref> The group released its second and third singles, "[[Tearin' Up My Heart]]" and "[[Here We Go (NSYNC song)|Here We Go]]", both of which managed to reach the top-10 in numerous countries in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=%27*NSYNC&titel=Tearin%27+Up+My+Heart&cat=s|title=*NSYNC&nbsp;– Tearin' Up My Heart|publisher=GfK Dutch Charts|archive-date=July 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715232947/http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=%27*NSYNC&titel=Tearin%27%20Up%20My%20Heart&cat=s}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=%27N+Sync&titel=Here+We+Go&cat=s|title='N SYNC&nbsp;– Here We Go|publisher=[[MegaCharts]]}}</ref> They eventually released the following German exclusive singles, "[[For the Girl Who Has Everything (song)|For the Girl Who Has Everything]]" and "[[Together Again (NSYNC song)|Together Again]]" throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web|title='N Sync {{!}} For the Girl Who Has Everything|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-3605|website=Offizielle Deutsche Charts}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title='N Sync {{!}} Together Again|url=https://www.offiziellecharts.de/titel-details-17136|website=Offizielle Deutsche Charts}}</ref>

===1998–1999: Breaking the American market and legal battle against Pearlman===
NSYNC captured the attention of [[Vincent DeGiorgio]], an A&R rep for [[RCA Records]]. After seeing the group perform in Budapest, he eventually signed them to [[RCA]] in 1998. The American label had the group record some new tracks to adjust their album for the US market. The group released its debut American single, "[[I Want You Back (NSYNC song)|I Want You Back]]" on January 20, 1998. It reached number 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=The Hot 100&nbsp;– the week of May 2, 1998|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1998-05-02|url-status=live|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> An album called ''[['N Sync (album)|'N Sync]]'' followed on March 24, 1998. Album sales were sluggish, debuting at number 82 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], but were helped when the [[Disney Channel]] aired a concert special on July 18, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title='N Sync in Concert|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0166281/|url-status=live|website=[[IMDb]]|date=July 18, 1998|publisher=}}</ref> The concert was first offered to the [[Backstreet Boys]], but they had to back out due to member [[Brian Littrell]] needing heart surgery, later doing their own special in 1999.<ref>{{cite web|last=Franich|first=Darren|title=Backstreet Boys vs. 'N Sync: The great boy band debate &#124; EW.com|url=http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/08/09/backstreet-boys-vs-n-sync/|url-status=live|access-date=July 23, 2012|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Five weeks before the concert, the album sat at number 82 on the albums chart;<ref>{{Cite news|title=Billboard 200 Chart|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1998-06-13}} June 13, 1998.</ref> three weeks after the concert, the album reached number nine.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Bilboard 200 Chart|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/1998-08-15}} August 15, 1998.</ref> The group's profile continued to rise with the subsequent single release "[[Tearin' Up My Heart]]", which became a hit on pop radio and one of the "100 Greatest Songs of the 90s" according to VH1.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2007-12-13|title=Top 100 Songs of the 90s|work=[[VH1]]|url=http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220195514/http://blog.vh1.com/2007-12-13/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/|archive-date=2007-12-20}}</ref> Regular touring, including an opening spot on [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[The Velvet Rope Tour]], and television spots on shows like ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' also bolstered sales for the album, which was eventually certified diamond for shipments in excess of 10 million units.<ref name="riaa.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=N%20Sync&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|title=Gold and platinum|publisher=RIAA|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924152059/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=N%20Sync&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1958&endYear=2008&sort=Artist&perPage=25|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref>

On November 10, 1998, the group released a holiday album, ''[[Home for Christmas (NSYNC album)|Home for Christmas]]''. The album peaked at number 7 and sold 2 million copies.<ref name="riaa.com"/> With this, NSYNC achieved the rare feat of having two albums in the Billboard Top 10 at the same time. 7 days later on November 16, 1998, NSYNC released ''[[The Winter Album (NSYNC album)|The Winter Album]]'' in Germany. One of the songs on the album "[[U Drive Me Crazy]]" was a major hit in Spain peaking at number 4. The group scored its first top 10 on the Hot 100 with their third single, "[[(God Must Have Spent) A Little More Time on You]]", which peaked at number 8 in February 1999. Country group [[Alabama (American band)|Alabama]] later re-recorded the song and released it as a single that featured vocals from NSYNC. The fourth and final single from the album, "[[I Drive Myself Crazy]]", was a modest chart hit, but a mainstay on ''[[Total Request Live]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jackman|first=Ian|title=Total Request Live: The Ultimate Fan Guide|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2000|isbn=9780743418508|pages=71}} "'NSYNC, 'I Drive Myself Crazy' highest position: 40 days at number one."</ref> NSYNC also recorded their version of the song “Trashin’ The Camp” with [[Phil Collins]]. The song appears on the soundtrack to the Disney movie [[Tarzan (1999 film)|''Tarzan'' (1999 film)]]. They also did “Somewhere, Someday” which appears on the soundtrack to [[Pokémon: The First Movie|''Pokémon: The First Movie'']]. In September 1999, the group collaborated with [[Gloria Estefan]] on a song for the soundtrack for her movie ''[[Music of the Heart]]''. The track "[[Music of My Heart]]" reached number 2 on Billboard's Top-100 single chart and served as a stopgap between album releases.

In 1999, NSYNC entered a publicized legal battle with Lou Pearlman, due to what the group believed were illicit business practices on his part.<ref name="Pearlman1">{{cite web|last=Manning|first=Kara|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432531/19991124/n_sync.jhtml|title='N Sync Scores Small Victory As Legal Battle Begins|publisher=MTV News|access-date=October 26, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071227170625/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1432531/19991124/n_sync.jhtml| archive-date= December 27, 2007<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref> NSYNC sued Pearlman and his record company, Trans Continental, for [[fraud|defraud]]ing the group of more than fifty percent of their earnings, rather than his promise of only receiving one-sixth of the profits, similar to his promise of one-sixth of the profits with the Backstreet Boys.<ref name="Pearlman1" /> The group threatened to leave and sign with [[Jive Records]], which prompted Pearlman and RCA to countersue NSYNC for US$150&nbsp;million.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Knopper|first=Steve|date=6 January 2009|year=2009|title=Appetite for Self-Destruction: The Spectacular Crash of the Record Industry in the Digital Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yd2Hm8BlzZUC&q=pg%3DPA97&pg=PA97|url-status=live|publisher=Simon & Schuster|page=97|isbn=9781416594550}} "In about a month, the negotiations went forward and 'NSync signed with Calder's company."</ref> Trans Continental, along with RCA's parent BMG Entertainment, went to federal court and filed said $150 million suit in an effort to stop NSYNC's move to Jive, to prevent the band from performing or recording under the name NSYNC, and to force NSYNC to return masters recorded that year in preparation of their second album (originally scheduled for release that fall by RCA, the album was then moved to early 2000).<ref>{{cite web|date=1999-11-30|title='N Sync album on the way|url=http://www.canoe.com:80/JamMusicArtistsN/nsync.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000903194010/http://www.canoe.com/JamMusicArtistsN/nsync.html|archive-date=September 3, 2000|website=[[Jam!]]|publisher=[[Canoe (website)|Canoe]]}}</ref> The suit also claims Jive executives induced the group into breaking its Trans Continental contract.<ref name="Countersuit">{{cite web|last=Wolk|first=Josh|date=October 13, 1999|title='N Court|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84723,00.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221194407/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,84723,00.html|archive-date=December 21, 2007<!--Added by DASHBot-->|access-date=December 3, 2007|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}</ref> Pearlman's request for a preliminary injunction against the band was denied.<ref name="Pearlman1" /> In December 1999, NSYNC and Pearlman reached an undisclosed settlement out of court,<ref>{{Cite news|date=1999-12-29|title='N Sync and Trans Con Settle|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nsync/articles/story/5922830/n_sync_and_trans_con_settle|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205005532/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/nsync/articles/story/5922830/n_sync_and_trans_con_settle|archive-date=2008-12-05}}</ref> freeing the group to release future albums on Jive Records.<ref name="Jive">{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html|title =Zomba Records, LTD: Company History|publisher=FundingUniverse.com|access-date=December 4, 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071201143052/http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Zomba-Records-Ltd-Company-History.html| archive-date= December 1, 2007<!--Added by DASHBot-->}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Pareles|first=Jon|date=2000-04-15|title=CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK; The Molting of a Boy Band: 'N Sync Spreads Its Wings|language=en-US|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/15/arts/critic-s-notebook-the-molting-of-a-boy-band-n-sync-spreads-its-wings.html|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

===2000–2001: ''No Strings Attached'' and groundbreaking success===
With their legal woes behind them, NSYNC refocused and worked on tracks for its second album. In January 2000, the group released "[[Bye Bye Bye]]", an upbeat dance track, which shot into the top 5 of the Hot 100 and spent 5 weeks atop the [[Hot 100 Airplay]] chart.

Joey Fatone and Lance Bass have offered a different perspective on *NSYNC disbanding, indicating that a lack of transparency left them unprepared for the prospect of a breakup.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> In a 2019 interview on ''The Jenny McCarthy Show'', Fatone said the group believed they would be reuniting because they were young and “didn't know better at first''.''”<ref name=":1" /> He then went on to say that the momentum of the ''[[Justified (album)|Justified]]'' album and tour was the reason for prolonging a group reunion that would result in new music.<ref name=":1" /> Recalling a conversation he'd had with his bandmates, Joey elaborated “I said ‘Listen, I'm all good with everybody doing their own shit. I'm totally fine with it, ''just let us know next time''.’ Meaning: I could’ve done a lot more shit than sit around waiting for your dumb ass while you're going out on tour. I could’ve, honestly. ‘Cause the minute we parted our ways in the sense of a group I was like ‘Shit, I went and did Broadway - I did ''Rent'' on Broadway, I did ''Little Shop of Horrors''.’ I started doing things at first, I was waiting ‘cause I know that when you do an album and you're doing stuff with a group it takes a long—it's a long, i-it's a process. So it was interesting. I was just like ‘Dude, just let me know next time,’ I said. ‘Cause next time I ain’t waiting for ''nobody''.”<ref name=":1">{{Citation|title=Joey Fatone on The Jenny McCarthy|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vVLrFb6b1mw| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/vVLrFb6b1mw| archive-date=2021-10-29|language=en|access-date=2021-07-23}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

When asked how he felt about the fallout of *NSYNC's breakup, Bass explained “Me and the guys were never...on bad terms at all, you know, it's just life goes on and y-you know you have more interests; you have to focus on your career and it's great. Uh, the thing I was most disappointed in was not just Justin leaving the band, um... it's that our whole team - our record label, our management, everything like that - they ''all'' knew. They all ''knew'' it was over for three years before they told '''''me'''''. And so for three years I'm sitting there getting ready for a new album as everyone else knows we’re moving on. And so, I didn't get - I turned down, you know, there was a sitcom I was doin’. Had to turn it down.
