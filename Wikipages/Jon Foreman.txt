'''Jonathan Mark Foreman''' (born October 22, 1976) is an American musician, the lead singer, guitarist, main songwriter and co-founder of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Switchfoot]]. He started Switchfoot in 1996 with drummer [[Chad Butler]] and his brother [[Tim Foreman]] on bass guitar. [[Jerome Fontamillas]] and [[Drew Shirley]] later joined the band.

== Personal life ==

Foreman was born in [[San Bernardino County, California]], but his family moved to Massachusetts and Virginia Beach during his childhood. There he became fast friends with Todd Cooper, who encouraged him to learn guitar.<ref>[http://www.freewebs.com/landofbrokenhearts1/interviewwithtodd.htm Interview with Todd Cooper] {{dead link|date=January 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Cooper was later a guitar tech for Switchfoot, although he left in 2005 to pursue his own musical career.

After several years, Foreman and his family moved back to Southern California, this time settling in [[San Diego]]. He graduated from [[San Dieguito Academy]] in the North County Coastal area of San Diego, California. Foreman attended [[University of California, San Diego|UC San Diego]] and later dropped out to follow his singing career.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.landofbrokenhearts1.org/jonsbio.htm|title=JON FOREMAN BIOGRAPHY|access-date=September 22, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Foreman married Emily Masen in 2002, and the couple had a daughter in 2012.<ref name="myswitchfeed.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.myswitchfeed.com/switchfoot/bio/jonforeman/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 21, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101073356/http://www.myswitchfeed.com/switchfoot/bio/jonforeman/ |archive-date=January 1, 2015 }} Jon Foreman Bio</ref> The couple welcomed their second child, a son, in June 2018.<ref name="“theknow.com”">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=March 21, 2019|title=Switchfoot frontman on the group's hiatus, his bandmate's cancer and more ahead of Denver show|url=https://theknow.denverpost.com/2019/03/21/switchfoot-tour-break-native-tongue-denver/211116/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 28, 2021|website=Denver Post}}</ref>

One of Foreman's favorite pastimes is surfing,<ref name=autogenerated1 /> and when not on tour, he resides in [[Cardiff-by-the-Sea, Encinitas, California|Cardiff-by-the-Sea]], a small suburb of [[San Diego, California]].<ref name="myswitchfeed.com"/>

Foreman is a committed [[nondenominational Christian]]; however, his goal with Switchfoot has always been to make music for all people. "For us, these songs are for everyone. Calling us 'Christian rock' tends to be a box that closes some people out and excludes them. And that's not what we're trying to do. Music has always opened my mind — and that's what we want."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2004/01/09/switchfoot_steps_toward_stardom|title=Switchfoot steps toward stardom|newspaper=Boston.com|date=January 9, 2004|access-date=September 22, 2014|last1=Morse|first1=Steve}}</ref>

=== Fiction Family ===
{{main|Fiction Family}}
In 2006, Foreman and [[Nickel Creek]] member [[Sean Watkins]] started collaborating on a duo project originally called "The Real SeanJon", which was later renamed "[[Fiction Family]]".<ref name="news">{{cite web|url=http://www.nickelcreek.com/ |title=Nickel Creek official website |publisher=Nickelcreek.com |access-date=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Their self-titled debut, ''[[Fiction Family (album)|Fiction Family]]'', was released on January 20, 2009.

"The album was recorded and written in parts because Nickel Creek and Switchfoot are both hard working, touring acts, we were rarely home from tour at the same time," says Foreman. "Consequently the tracks were passed back and forth between Sean and I. Whoever was home from tour would chip away at the songs with no real expectations at all, mainly just for ourselves and for the love of the song I suppose. We came up with a few cowboy rules for the project: No double tracking. No pussyfooting. No tuning of vocals."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2008/10/exclusive-nickel-creek-switchfoot-members-start-new-band/ |title=Exclusive: Nickel Creek, Switchfoot Members Start New Band |date=October 3, 2008 |work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |access-date=September 22, 2014}}</ref>

In November 2012, the band released an extended play titled ''[[Holiday EP]]''. Their second studio album, ''[[Fiction Family Reunion]]'', was released on January 29, 2013.

=== Solo projects ===

Foreman has also worked on various solo projects, independently releasing four EPs, titled ''Fall'', ''Winter'', ''Spring'', and ''Summer''. For the project, Foreman teamed with [[Credential Recordings]] in a partnership with Switchfoot's imprint record label, [[lowercase people records]].<ref>[http://bandweblogs.com/blog/2007/11/27/jon-foreman-from-switchfoot-to-release-solo-eps-mp3/ Jon Foreman from Switchfoot to release solo EPs + MP3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216144149/http://bandweblogs.com/blog/2007/11/27/jon-foreman-from-switchfoot-to-release-solo-eps-mp3/ |date=February 16, 2008 }} - Published November 27, 2007 (retrieved April 21, 2009)</ref>  In October 2008, Foreman released a collection of songs from his seasonal EPs along with two new tracks.

In April 2009, he was [[GMA Dove Award]]-nominated for Male Vocalist of the Year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://christianmusic.about.com/od/doves/a/09doves.htm |title=40th Annual Dove Awards Nominees & Winners |publisher=[[About.com]] |access-date=April 24, 2009 |author=Kim Jones}}</ref>

In November 2014, Foreman announced four EPs under the name ''The Wonderlands''.

== Songwriting style ==
{{or section|date=December 2015}}
Foreman's songwriting tends to be very dynamic, and he often employs a wide range of different instrumentation, including, but not limited to: guitar, violin, cello, trumpet, mandolin, sitar, flute, saxophone, clarinet, synthesizer, piano, miscellaneous percussion, and harmonica. Foreman has always aimed to use interesting instrumentation when writing for [[Switchfoot]], mostly on some of the band's first albums such as ''[[The Legend of Chin]]'', ''[[New Way to Be Human]]'', and ''[[Learning to Breathe (Switchfoot album)|Learning to Breathe]]''.
