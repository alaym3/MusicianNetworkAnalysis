He also had a brief uncredited role in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935) starring [[Boris Karloff]] as [[Frankenstein's monster]].

Around this time Brennan had what he later described as "the luckiest break in the world". He was taking part in a fight scene when an actor kicked him in the face and all his teeth were knocked out. He had to put in false teeth. "I looked all right off the set", he said. "But when necessary I could take 'em out{{snd}}and suddenly look about 40 years older."<ref name="los"/>

Brennan did another Three Stooges short, ''[[Restless Knights]]'', and a short called ''Hunger Pains'' in (1935).

===Work at MGM===
An early break for Brennan came when he was cast in ''[[The Wedding Night]]'' (1935), produced by [[Sam Goldwyn]], alongside [[Gary Cooper]] (it was actually their second film together). He was only an extra, but his part was expanded during filming and it resulted in Brennan's getting a contract with Goldwyn.<ref name="los"/><ref name="new"/><ref name="post">{{cite news|author=L. N. |date=June 4, 1939|title=He works anywhere to earn an honest academy award|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

Goldwyn mostly loaned out Brennan's services to other studios. MGM put him in ''[[West Point of the Air]]'' (1935). He was reunited with Whale in ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), in which he had a brief speaking part and also worked as a stuntman.

Brennan's parts remained small in ''[[Party Wire]]'' (1935), ''[[Spring Tonic]]'' (1935), ''[[The Gay Lady (1935 film)|The Gay Lady]]'' (1935), ''[[Man on the Flying Trapeze]]'' (1935), and ''[[Welcome Home (1935 film)|Welcome Home]]'' (1935).

He could be seen in ''[[We're in the Money (film)|We're in the Money]]'' (1935) and ''[[She Couldn't Take It]]'' (1935).

===Move to Supporting Actor===
Brennan finally moved up to significant roles with a decent part in Goldwyn's ''[[Barbary Coast (film)|Barbary Coast]]'' (1935), directed by [[Howard Hawks]] and an uncredited William Wyler.<ref>{{cite news|title=Goldwyn still picking winners|date=December 28, 1935|work=The Times of India}}</ref> "That really set me up", he said later.<ref name="los"/>

He followed it with small appearances in ''[[Metropolitan (1935 film)|Metropolitan]]'' (1935) and ''[[Seven Keys to Baldpate (1935 film)|Seven Keys to Baldpate]]'' (1935).

He had one of the leads in ''[[Three Godfathers (1936 film)|Three Godfathers]]'' (1936) playing one of the title outlaws.

He had a small role in ''[[These Three]]'' (1936) with Wyler and a bigger one in [[Walter Wanger]]'s ''[[The Moon's Our Home]]'' (1936) and ''[[Fury (1936 film)|Fury]]'' (1936), directed by [[Fritz Lang]].

===First Oscar: ''Come and Get It'' (1936)===
Brennan's breakthrough part came when cast by [[Howard Hawks]] as Swan Bostrom in the period film ''[[Come and Get It (1936 film)|Come and Get It]]'' (1936), playing the sidekick of [[Edward Arnold (actor)|Edward Arnold]] who eventually marries the girl Arnold abandons (played by [[Frances Farmer]]). Producer [[Sam Goldwyn]] fired Hawks during filming and replaced him with William Wyler. Brennan's performance earned him the first [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

Brennan followed it with support parts in ''[[Banjo on My Knee (film)|Banjo on My Knee]]'' (1936) at Fox, ''[[She's Dangerous]]'' (1937), and ''[[When Love is Young]]'' (1937). Goldwyn announced him for a role in ''[[The Real Glory]]'' in 1936, but he ended up not appearing in the final film.<ref>{{cite news|date=October 29, 1936|title=News from hollywood|work=New York Times}}</ref>

Brennan had his first lead role in ''[[Affairs of Cappy Ricks]]'' (1937) at [[Republic Pictures]]. He followed it with the co-starring part in Fox's ''[[Wild and Woolly (1937 film)|Wild and Woolly]]'' (1937), billed second after [[Jane Withers]]. He was in ''[[The Buccaneer (1938 film)|The Buccaneer]]'' (1938), directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Schallert, E. |date=August 3, 1937|title=Scott and MacMurray leads in air feature|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

Brennan portrayed town drunk and accused murderer Muff Potter in ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1938 film)|The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' (1938).

Brennan followed it with ''[[The Texans]]'' (1938), ''[[Mother Carey's Chickens (film)|Mother Carey's Chickens]]'' (1938), and Goldwyn's ''[[The Cowboy and the Lady (1938 film)|The Cowboy and the Lady]]'' (1938) with [[Gary Cooper]] – the first time Brennan played Cooper's sidekick.

===Second Oscar: ''Kentucky'' (1938)===
Brennan won his second Best Supporting Oscar for ''[[Kentucky (film)|Kentucky]]'' (1938), a horse racing film from [[20th Century Fox]] with [[Loretta Young]].

He supported [[Fred Astaire]] and [[Ginger Rogers]] in ''[[The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle]]'' (1939). Brennan also appeared in ''[[Melody of Youth (1939 film)|Melody of Youth]]'' (1939), and ''[[Stanley and Livingstone]]'' (1939) at Fox.<ref name="post"/> At MGM he was in ''[[Joe and Ethel Turp Call on the President]]'' (1939).

Throughout his career, Brennan was frequently called upon to play characters considerably older than he was. The loss of many teeth in the 1932 accident, rapidly thinning hair, thin build, and unusual vocal intonations all made him seem older than he was. He used these features to great effect. In many of his film roles, Brennan wore dentures; in MGM's ''[[Northwest Passage (film)|Northwest Passage]]'' (1940)&nbsp;– a film set in the late 18th century&nbsp;– he wore a dental prosthesis which made him appear to have rotting and broken teeth. Brennan was billed third in ''Northwest Passage'' after [[Spencer Tracy]] and Robert Young.

Zanuck at Fox announced he wanted to make ''The Man from Home'', once a vehicle for [[Will Rogers]], with Brennan.<ref>{{cite news|author=Schallert, E. |date=February 16, 1939|title=Zanuck plans stardom for walter brennan|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Instead Brennan was  top-billed in Fox's ''[[Maryland (1940 film)|Maryland]]'' (1940), an attempt to repeat the success of ''Kentucky''.<ref>{{cite news|author=Schallert, E. |date=December 6, 1939|title=DRAMA|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> Brennan said he had been working constantly since Christmas 1937. "I'm just plain punch drunk", he said.<ref>{{cite news|author=Frederick C Othman |date=February 24, 1940|title=Brennan ready to collapse as work piles on|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

===Third Oscar: ''The Westerner'' (1940)===
Brennan had one of his best ever roles in Goldwyn's ''[[The Westerner (1940 film)|The Westerner]]'' (1940), playing the villainous [[Judge Roy Bean]] opposite Gary Cooper. William Wyler directed and the film earned Brennan another Best Supporting Actor Oscar.

Goldwyn bought ''Trading Post'' to be a vehicle for Brennan but it was never made.<ref>{{cite news|date=July 15, 1940|title=SCREEN NEWS HERE AND IN HOLLYWOOD|work=New York Times}}</ref>

Instead he supported [[Deanna Durbin]] in ''[[Nice Girl?]]'' (1941), then Cooper again in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' (1941) and Hawks' ''[[Sergeant York (film)|Sergeant York]]'' (1941). ''Sergeant York'', which earned Brennan a fourth Oscar nomination, was an enormous hit. He could also be seen in ''[[This Woman is Mine]]'' (1941), as a sea captain.

Brennan played the top-billed lead in ''[[Swamp Water]]'' (1941), the first American film by the director [[Jean Renoir]], a drama also featuring [[Walter Huston]] and starring [[Dana Andrews]]. He was in ''[[Rise and Shine (film)|Rise and Shine]]'' (1941) then played the reporter Sam Blake, who befriended and encouraged [[Lou Gehrig]] (played by Cooper) in ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942).

Brennan was in some war films, ''[[Stand By for Action]]'' (1942) and ''[[Hangmen Also Die!]]'' (1943), in which he played a Czechoslovak professor. He was in ''[[Slightly Dangerous]]'' (1943), ''The Last Will and Testament of Tom Smith'' (1943, a short), and Goldwyn's Russia-set war epic ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'' (1943).<ref>{{cite news|author=Schallert, E. |date=April 8, 1943|title=DRAMA AND FILM|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>

He was top billed in a follow up to ''Kentucky'' and ''Maryland'' at Fox, ''[[Home in Indiana]]'' (1944).

Brennan was particularly skilled in playing the sidekick of the protagonist or the "grumpy old man" in films such as ''[[To Have and Have Not (film)|To Have and Have Not]]'' (1944), the Hawks-directed [[Humphrey Bogart]] film which introduced [[Lauren Bacall]].

Brennan was a comic pirate in the [[Bob Hope]] film ''[[The Princess and the Pirate]]'' (1944). He was teamed with John Wayne for the first time since both men obtained stardom in ''[[Dakota (1945 film)|Dakota]]'' (1945), directed by [[Joseph Kane]]. He supported [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[A Stolen Life (1946 film)|A Stolen Life]]'' (1946) and was in a musical at Fox, ''[[Centennial Summer]]'' (1946), where he played a family paterfamilias.

===Westerns roles===
Brennan returned to villainy as [[Newman Haynes Clanton|Old Man Clanton]] in ''[[My Darling Clementine]]'' (1946), opposite [[Henry Fonda]] for director [[John Ford]].

Brennan followed this with parts in ''[[Nobody Lives Forever (1946 film)|Nobody Lives Forever]]'' (1946) at Warners,<ref>{{cite news|author=Schallert, E. |date=August 15, 1944|title=Bellamy signs pact with hunt stromberg|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> and a girl-and-dog story at Republic, ''[[Driftwood (1947 film)|Driftwood]]'' (1947).

He did another Americana film at Fox, ''[[Scudda Hoo! Scudda Hay!]]'' (1948), then was in one of the best films in his career, ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948), playing John Wayne's sidekick for Howard Hawks.

After supporting [[Robert Mitchum]] in ''[[Blood on the Moon]]'' (1948) he played another kindly father role in ''[[The Green Promise]]'' (1949). Brennan was billed second to [[Rod Cameron (actor)|Rod Cameron]] in ''[[Brimstone (1949 film)|Brimstone]]'' (1949), directed by Kane, and he supported Gary Cooper in ''[[Task Force (film)|Task Force]]'' (1949).

Brennan focused on Westerns: ''[[Singing Guns]]'' (1950) with [[Vaughn Monroe]], ''[[A Ticket to Tomahawk]]'' (1950), ''[[Curtain Call at Cactus Creek]]'' (1950), ''[[The Showdown (1950 film)|The Showdown]]'' (1950) with [[Wild Bill Elliot]], ''[[Surrender (1950 film)|Surrender]]'' (1950), ''[[Along the Great Divide]]'' (1951), ''[[Best of the Badmen]]'' (1951), and ''[[Return of the Texan]]'' (1952).

''[[The Wild Blue Yonder (1951 film)|The Wild Blue Yonder]]'' (1951) was a non-Western, a war film. So too was ''[[Lure of the Wilderness]]'' (1952), a remake of ''Swamp Water'' with Brennan reprising his role, though given less screen time on this occasion.

Brennan was in ''[[Sea of Lost Ships]]'' (1953) with [[John Derek]], ''[[Drums Across the River]]'' (1954) with [[Audie Murphy]], ''[[The Far Country]]'' (1954) with [[James Stewart]], and ''[[Four Guns to the Border]]'' (1954) with [[Rory Calhoun]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Schallert, E. |date=April 8, 1954|title=Drama|work=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> He had a good part in ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]'' (1955) at MGM.

Brennan began to work on television, guest starring on episodes of ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'', ''[[Lux Video Theatre]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse]]'', ''[[Ethel Barrymore Theater]]'', ''[[Cavalcade of America]]'', and ''[[The Ford Television Theatre]]''. He played an old outlaw, Joe, in the 1956 episode, "Vengeance Canyon", on ''[[Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre]]''. In the story line, Joe tries to convince a young  Clint Harding ([[Ben Cooper]]), that vengeance is not productive. [[Sheb Wooley]] played another outlaw, Brock, this episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0754345/|title=Vengeance Canyon on ''Dick Powell's Zane Grey Theatre''|publisher=Internet Movie Database|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

He appeared as himself as a musical judge in the 1953–1954 ABC series ''[[Jukebox Jury]]''. Brennan later said he preferred doing television to movies because there were not "long lay offs between jobs."<ref name="new">{{cite news|author=W. M. |date=September 23, 1974|title=Walter brennan dead at 80; winner of 3 academy awards|work=New York Times}}</ref>

====''The Real McCoys''====
[[File:Howard Hawks'Rio Bravo trailer (37).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Brennan in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'']]
Brennan had resisted overtures to star in a regular TV series but relented for ''[[The Real McCoys]]'', a [[sitcom]] about a poor [[West Virginia]] family that relocated to a farm in [[Southern California]].<ref>{{cite news|author=V. A. |date=May 6, 1957|title=WALTER BRENNAN TO BE STAR ON TV|work=New York Times}}</ref> It was a hit and ran from 1957 to 1963.<ref>{{cite news|author=O.

Brennan continued to appear in films and other TV shows during the series' run such as ''[[Colgate Theatre]]'' and another Howard Hawks' picture, ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]'' (1959), in support to John Wayne and [[Dean Martin]].

After five years on ABC, ''The Real McCoys'' switched to [[CBS]] for a final season.

It also featured [[Richard Crenna]], [[Kathleen Nolan]], [[Lydia Reed]], and [[Michael Winkelman]].<ref>{{cite news|author=L.

===Singing career===
Brennan's success with ''The Real McCoys'' led to him making a few recordings, the most popular being "[[Old Rivers]]", about an old farmer and his mule, which was released as a single in 1962 by Liberty Records with "The Epic Ride of [[John H. Glenn]]" on the flip side. "Old Rivers" peaked at number five in the U.S. [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] chart, making the 67&nbsp;year-old Brennan the oldest living person to have a Top&nbsp;40 hit at the time, in fact, the oldest living person to have a top 5 hit.<ref>[[Casey Kasem]], "[[American Top 40]]", November 6, 1982</ref>  At age&nbsp;68, Brennan reached the Top&nbsp;40 again, this time with "[[Mama Sang a Song]]" on November&nbsp;17, 1962.

In his music, he sometimes worked with [[Allen "Puddler" Harris]], a [[Louisiana]] native who was a member of the original [[Ricky Nelson]] Band.

After ''The Real McCoys'' ended, Brennan provided the voice for a cartoon of ''[[The Shooting of Dan McGrew]]''.

==Personal life==
[[File:Tony Martinez Richard Crenna Walter Brennan Real McCoys 1962.JPG|thumb|upright|''[[The Real McCoys]]'' (1962), L-R: [[Tony Martínez (actor)|Tony Martínez]], Walter Brennan, [[Richard Crenna]]]]
In 1920, Brennan married Ruth Caroline Wells (1897-1997). They had three children in their 54 year marriage: Arthur, Walter, and Ruth. Ruth's husband, Dixon McCully Lademan, was a captain in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in World War II, the [[Korean War]], and the [[Vietnam War]]. Brennan's son Arthur Wells "Big Mike" Brennan and his wife, Florence Irene (Whitman) Brennan, lived in [[Joseph, Oregon]].

In 1940, Brennan purchased the 12,000-acre Lightning Creek Ranch, 20&nbsp;miles north of [[Joseph, Oregon]]. He built the Indian Lodge Motel, a movie theater, and a variety store in Joseph, and continued going there between film roles until his death. Some members of his family continue to live in the area.

== Religious and political views ==
Brennan, a [[Roman Catholic]], did not publicize his own religious affiliation, but declared, "I'm too old not to be a religious fella. [...] It appears we are losing something a lot of people made a lot of sacrifices for."<ref name="pearson" /> In 1964, Brennan spoke at "Project Prayer", a rally attended by 2,500 at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. The gathering, hosted by [[Anthony Eisley]], sought to flood [[United States Congress|Congress]] with letters in support of mandatory [[school prayer]], following two decisions of the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] in 1962 and 1963 that had struck down the practice of mandatory prayer in public schools as being in conflict with the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]].<ref name=pearson>{{cite web |url=http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf |title="The Washington Merry-Go-Round", Drew Pearson column, May 14, 1964 |publisher=dspace.wrlc.org |url-status=dead |access-date=February 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116232324/http://dspace.wrlc.org/doc/bitstream/2041/50658/b18f14-0514zdisplay.pdf |archive-date=January 16, 2013 }}</ref>

According to his biographer [[Carl Rollyson]], Brennan was fiercely opposed to Communism and  reportedly branded people as Communists if they supported John Fitzgerald Kennedy. "He thought that the [[Watts riots]] could have been stopped 'with a machine gun.'" and expressed satisfaction at the murder of the [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.]]  Rollyson also reported that Brennan's home "included a bunker stocked with weapons and food in anticipation of a Soviet invasion."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Daniel |first1=Douglass K. |title=Book Review: Bad grandpa?

==Death ==
[[File:Walter Brennan Grave.JPG|thumb|200px|Brennan's grave at San Fernando Mission Cemetery]]
Brennan spent his last years mostly in retirement at his ranch in Moorpark in Ventura County, California. He died of [[emphysema]] at the age of 80 in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref>{{cite news|author=Chawkins, Steve|date=October 8, 1999|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/08/local/me-19944|title=Camarillo Decides on the 'Real McCoy'|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}.</ref> His remains were interred at [[San Fernando Mission Cemetery]] in Los Angeles.{{Citation needed |date=August 2021}}

== Legacy ==
Film historians and critics have long regarded Brennan as one of the finest [[character actors]] in motion picture history. While the roles he was adept at playing were diverse, he is probably best remembered for his portrayals in [[Western (genre)|Western]] movies, such as Judge Roy Bean in ''The Westerner'', trail hand Nadine Groot in ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'', and Deputy Stumpy in ''[[Rio Bravo (film)|Rio Bravo]]''. He was the first actor to win three Academy Awards and remains the only person to have won [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] three times. However, he remained somewhat embarrassed as to how he won the awards; in the early years of the Academy Awards, extras were given the right to vote. Brennan was popular with the Union of Film Extras, and since their numbers were overwhelming, he won every time he was nominated. His third win led to the disenfranchisement of the union from Oscar voting.  Following this change, Brennan lost his fourth Best Supporting Actor nomination in 1941 for ''Sergeant York'' (the award went to Donald Crisp for ''How Green Was My Valley'').

In all, Brennan appeared in more than 230 film and television roles during a career that spanned nearly five decades. For his contributions to the film industry, he has a [[List of actors with Hollywood Walk of Fame motion picture stars|motion pictures star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6501 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walkoffame.com/walter-brennan |title=Walter Brennan Inducted to the Walk of Fame |website=walkoffame.com |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |date=February 8, 1960 |access-date=December 7, 2016}}</ref> In 1970, he was inducted into the [[Western Performers Hall of Fame]] at the [[National Cowboy & Western Heritage Museum]] in [[Oklahoma City]], where his photograph hangs prominently.{{Citation needed |date=August 2021}}
