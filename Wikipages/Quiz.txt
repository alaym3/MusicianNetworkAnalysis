A '''quiz''' is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects. Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills. They can also be televised for entertainment purposes, often in a game show format.

==Etymology==
The earliest known examples of the word date back to 1780; its etymology is unknown, but it may have originated in student slang. It initially meant an "odd, eccentric person"{{efn|The now-disused word "quiz", which also referred to an "odd person" and has a likewise obscure origin, dates back from about the same time.<ref>{{Cite OED|quoz, n. (and int.)|156931}}</ref>}} or a "joke, hoax". Later (perhaps by association with words such as "inquisitive") it came to mean "to observe, study intently", and thence (from about mid-19th century) "test, exam."<ref>{{Cite OED|quiz, n.|156832}}</ref><ref>{{Cite OED|quiz, v.1|156834}}</ref>

There is a [[Folk Etymology|well-known myth]] about the word ''quiz'' that says that in 1791 a Dublin theatre owner named Richard Daly made a bet that he could introduce a word into the language within 24 hours. He then went out and hired a group of [[street children]] to write the word "quiz", which was a [[nonsense word]], on walls around the city of [[Dublin]]. Within a day, the word was common currency and had acquired a meaning (since no one knew what it meant, everyone thought it was some sort of test) and Daly had some extra cash in his pocket.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-qui1.htm|title=World Wide Words: Quiz|work=World Wide Words}}</ref> However, there is no evidence to support the story, and the term was already in use before the alleged bet in 1791.

==In education==
In an educational context, a quiz is usually a form of a student assessment, but often has fewer questions of less difficulty and requires less time for completion than a [[Test (student assessment)|test]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/10/01/global.connections.quiz/index.html|title=Quiz: How much do you know about China and Turkey?|work=cnn.com}}</ref> This use is typically found in the United States, Canada, the [[Philippines]], [[Dominican Republic]] and some colleges in India.
For instance, in a mathematics classroom, a quiz may check comprehension of a type of [[mathematical exercise]].  Some instructors schedule a daily or weekly quiz ranging from five to thirty relatively easy questions for the purpose of having the students review their previous lessons before attending the next class. A "pop quiz" is a quiz that students are given no time to prepare for; they are simply surprised with it in class.{{cn|date=September 2020}}

==Other quizzes==
Additionally, a [[personality quiz]] may be a series of multiple-choice questions about the respondent without right or wrong answers. The responses to these questions are tallied according to a key, and the result purports to reveal some quality of the respondent. This kind of "quiz" was originally popularized by women's magazines such as ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]''. They have since become common on the [[Internet]], where the result page typically includes code which can be added to a [[blog]] entry to publicize the result. These postings are common on many sites like [[LiveJournal]].

The results of online quizzes are generally to be taken lightly, as they do not often reflect the true personality or relationship. They are also rarely [[psychometrics|psychometric]]ally [[validity (statistics)|valid]]. However, they may occasion reflection on the subject of the quiz and provide a springboard for a person to explore his or her emotions, beliefs, or actions.
