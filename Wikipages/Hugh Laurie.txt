Laurie's parents, who were both of Scottish descent, attended [[St Columba's United Reformed Church, Oxford|St Columba's Presbyterian Church]] (now [[United Reformed Church]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.saintcolumbas.org/about-us/our-history|title=Our History|publisher=St Columba's United Reformed Church, Oxford}}</ref> in Oxford.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dr. Feelbad|work=Rolling Stone|author=Strauss, Neil|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/13893076/dr_feelbad_hugh_laurie_became_the_dark_prince_of_prime_time_by_playing_the_best_vicodinaddicted_t|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070401072046/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/13893076/dr_feelbad_hugh_laurie_became_the_dark_prince_of_prime_time_by_playing_the_best_vicodinaddicted_t|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 April 2007|date=5 April 2007|access-date=13 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/5421264/Hugh-Laurie-interview.html |title=Hugh Laurie interview |work=The Daily Telegraph |access-date=11 December 2012|date=3 June 2009 |last1=Husband |first1=Stuart }}</ref> He notes that "belief in God didn't play a large role" in his home, but "a certain attitude to life and the living of it did".<ref name="actors"/> He followed this by stating, "Pleasure was something that was treated with great suspicion, pleasure was something that...

Laurie was brought up in Oxford and attended the [[Dragon School]] from ages seven to 13, later stating, "I was, in truth, a horrible child.

Like his father, Laurie rowed at school and university.<ref name="actors"/> In 1977, he was a member of the junior coxed pair that won the British national title before representing Britain's Youth Team at the 1977 Junior World Rowing Championships.

==Career==
===Acting===
[[File:Hugh Laurie Actors Guild.jpg|180px|thumb|Laurie in 2005]]
Forced to abandon rowing during a bout of [[glandular fever]], Laurie joined the [[Footlights|Cambridge Footlights]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Tatler List|url=http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list|publisher=Tatler|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205224814/http://www.tatler.com/the-tatler-list|archive-date=5 February 2016}}</ref> a university dramatic club that has produced many well-known actors and comedians. There he met [[Emma Thompson]], with whom he had a romantic relationship; the two remain good friends.<ref name="actors"/> She introduced him to his future comedy partner, [[Stephen Fry]]. Laurie, Fry and Thompson later parodied themselves as the ''[[University Challenge]]'' representatives of "Footlights College, Oxbridge" in "[[Bambi (Young Ones episode)|Bambi]]", an episode of ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', with the series' co-writer [[Ben Elton]] completing their team.

In 1980–81, his final year at university, besides rowing, Laurie was president of the Footlights, with Thompson as vice-president. They took their annual revue, ''[[The Cellar Tapes]]'', to the [[Edinburgh Fringe|Edinburgh Fringe Festival]] and won the first [[Perrier Comedy Award]]. The revue was written principally by Laurie and Fry, and the cast also included Thompson, [[Tony Slattery]], Paul Shearer and [[Penny Dwyer]]. The Perrier Award led to a West End transfer for ''The Cellar Tapes'' and a television version of the revue, broadcast in May 1982. It resulted in Laurie, Fry and Thompson being selected, along with Ben Elton, [[Robbie Coltrane]] and [[Siobhan Redmond]] to write and appear in a new sketch comedy show for [[Granada Television]], ''[[Alfresco (TV series)|Alfresco]]'', which ran for two series.

[[Fry and Laurie]] worked together on various projects throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Among them were the ''[[Blackadder]]'' series, written by [[Ben Elton]] and [[Richard Curtis]], starring [[Rowan Atkinson]], with Laurie in various roles, including [[George (Blackadder)|Prince George]] and [[George (Blackadder)|Lieutenant George]].<ref name="actors"/> Other projects followed, of which one was their [[BBC]] sketch comedy series ''[[A Bit of Fry & Laurie]]''; another project was ''[[Jeeves and Wooster]]'',<ref name="actors"/> an adaptation of [[P. G. Wodehouse]]'s stories, in which Laurie played Jeeves's employer, the amiable twit [[Bertie Wooster]]. He and Fry participated in charity stage events, such as ''Hysteria! 1, 2 & 3'' and [[Amnesty International]]'s ''[[The Secret Policeman's Balls|The Secret Policeman's Third Ball]]'', ''[[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]]'' TV shows and the variety show ''Fry and Laurie Host a [[Christmas Night with the Stars]]''. They collaborated again on the film ''[[Peter's Friends]]'' (1992) and came together for a retrospective show in 2010 titled ''Fry and Laurie Reunited''.

Laurie starred in the [[Thames Television]] film ''Letters from a Bomber Pilot'' (1985) directed by David Hodgson. This was a serious acting role, the film being dramatised from the letters home of [[Pilot Officer]] J.R.A. "Bob" Hodgson, a pilot in [[RAF Bomber Command]], who was [[killed in action]] in 1943.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/410109 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517160335/http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/410109 |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 May 2012 |title="LETTERS FROM A BOMBER PILOT (1985)" at bfi.org |publisher=Ftvdb.bfi.org.uk |date=16 April 2009 |access-date=12 August 2011}}</ref>

Laurie appeared in the music videos for the 1986 single "[[Experiment IV]]" by [[Kate Bush]], and the 1992 [[Annie Lennox]] single "[[Walking on Broken Glass]]" in [[British Regency]] period costume alongside [[John Malkovich]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Og0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26 |title=Billboard |date=7 December 2002 |access-date=7 November 2011 |page=26 }}</ref> Laurie appeared in the [[Spice Girls]]' film  ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'' (1997) and had a brief guest-starring role on ''[[Friends]]'' in "[[The One with Ross's Wedding]]" (1998).

Laurie's later film appearances include ''[[Sense and Sensibility (film)|Sense and Sensibility]]'' (1995), adapted by and starring [[Emma Thompson]]; the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] live-action film ''[[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|101 Dalmatians]]'' (1996), where he played Jasper, one of the bumbling criminals hired to kidnap the puppies; Elton's adaptation of his novel ''Inconceivable'', ''[[Maybe Baby (2000 film)|Maybe Baby]]'' (2000); ''[[Girl from Rio (2001 film)|Girl from Rio]]''; the [[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|2004 remake]] of ''[[The Flight of the Phoenix]]'', and ''[[Stuart Little (film)|Stuart Little]]''.

Since 2002, Laurie has appeared in a range of British television dramas, guest-starring that year in two episodes of the first season of the spy thriller series ''[[Spooks (TV series)|Spooks]]'' on BBC One. In 2003, he starred in and also directed ITV's comedy-drama series ''[[Fortysomething (UK series)|fortysomething]]'' (in one episode of which Stephen Fry appears). In 2001, he voiced the character of a bar patron in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode "[[One If by Clam, Two If by Sea]]". Laurie voiced the character of Mr. Wolf in the cartoon ''[[Preston Pig]]''. He was a panellist on the first episode of ''[[QI]]'', alongside Fry as host. In 2004, Laurie guest-starred as a professor in charge of a space probe called ''Beagle'', on ''[[The Lenny Henry Show]]''.

Between 2004 and 2012, Laurie starred as an acerbic physician specialising in diagnostic medicine, [[Gregory House|Dr. Gregory House]], in the Fox medical drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]''. For his portrayal, he assumed an American accent.<ref name="actors"/> He was in [[Namibia]] filming ''[[Flight of the Phoenix (2004 film)|Flight of the Phoenix]]'' and recorded his audition tape for the show in the bathroom of the hotel, as it was the only place he could get enough light.<ref name="usatoday">{{cite news|url= https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-11-15-hugh-laurie_x.htm|title=Hugh Laurie Gets Into 'House'|access-date=23 March 2008|author=Bill, Keveney|date=15 November 2004|work=USA Today}}</ref> [[Jacob Vargas]] operated the camera for the audition tape.

Laurie was nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/hugh-laurie |title=Hugh Laurie Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |access-date=30 April 2012}}</ref> for his role in ''House'' in 2005. Although he did not win, he did receive a [[Golden Globe]] in both 2006 and 2007 for his work on the series and the [[Screen Actors Guild]] award in 2007 and 2009. Laurie was also awarded a large increase in salary, from what was rumoured to be a mid-range five-figure sum to $350,000 per episode. Laurie was not nominated for the 2006 Emmys, apparently to the outrage of Fox executives,<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090422200515/http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/1416%2Cfeatures%2Cfans-fury-over-laurie8217s-emmy-snub |archive-date=22 April 2009 |url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/1416,features,fans-fury-over-laurie8217s-emmy-snub |title=Fans' fury over Laurie's Emmy snub |first=Anne |last=Bergman |work=[[The First Post]] |url-status=dead  }}</ref> but he still appeared in a scripted, pre-taped intro, where he parodied his ''House'' character by rapidly diagnosing host [[Conan O'Brien]] and then proceeded to grope him as the latter asked him for help to get to the Emmys on time. He would later go on to speak in French while presenting an Emmy with [[Helen Mirren|Dame Helen Mirren]], and has since been nominated in 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

Laurie was initially cast as [[Perry White]], the editor of the ''[[Daily Planet]]'', in Singer's film ''[[Superman Returns]]'' but had to bow out of the project because of his commitment to ''House''. In July 2006, Laurie appeared on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', where he also performed one of his own comic songs, "Mystery", accompanying himself on the piano.<ref name="actors"/> He hosted NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', in which he appeared in [[drag (clothing)|drag]] in a sketch about a man ([[Kenan Thompson]]) with a broken leg who accuses his doctor of being dishonest. Laurie played the man's wife.

In August 2007, Laurie appeared on [[BBC Four]]'s documentary ''Stephen Fry: 50 Not Out'', filmed in celebration of Fry's 50th birthday. In 2008, he took part in ''[[Blackadder Rides Again]]'' and appeared as Captain James Biggs in ''[[Street Kings]]'', opposite [[Keanu Reeves]] and [[Forest Whitaker]], and then in 2009 as the eccentric Dr. Cockroach, PhD in [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]]' ''[[Monsters vs. Aliens]]''. He also hosted ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' for the second time on the Christmas show in which he sang a medley of three-second Christmas songs to close his monologue. In 2009, Laurie returned to guest star in another ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode, "[[Business Guy]]", parodying [[Gregory House]]. In 2010, Laurie guest starred in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' "[[Treehouse of Horror XXI]]" as Roger, a castaway who is planning a murder scheme on a ship during Homer and Marge's second honeymoon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hugh Laurie in The Simpsons 'Treehouse of Horror XXI': B-Roll|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOx5vZk_wtU| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211029/eOx5vZk_wtU| archive-date=2021-10-29|publisher=YouTube|access-date=18 September 2013}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

While appearing on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' in 2006, he discussed his struggles with severe [[Major depressive disorder|clinical depression]].<ref name="actors"/> He told host [[James Lipton]] that he first concluded he had a problem whilst driving in a charity [[demolition derby]], during which he realised that seeing two cars collide and explode made him feel bored rather than excited or frightened; he quipped that "boredom is not an appropriate response to exploding cars".<ref name="actors"/> As of 2006 he was having regular sessions with a [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapist]].<ref name="actors"/><ref name="bbc1"/>
