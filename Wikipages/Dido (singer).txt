It's one of the most irritating things that my parents did to me.&nbsp;... Florian is a German man's name. That's just mean. To give your child a whole lot of odd names. They were all so embarrassing.&nbsp;... I thought it was cruel to call me Dido and then expect me to just deal with it."<ref name="Dido in Observer 2001"/> The name "Dido" derives from the legendary [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen of Carthage]].

Dido was educated at Thornhill Primary School in [[Islington]], Dallington School, [[City of London School for Girls|City of London Girls']] and [[Westminster School]], where she was taught by the contemporary musician and Head of Academic Music, [[Sinan Savaskan]]. After she stole a [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]] from school at the age of five,<ref>{{cite web|author=Vinod Advani|title=In tune with Dido|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/08/03/stories/1303140n.htm|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=3 August 2001|access-date=8 October 2008|url-status=usurped|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109235341/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/2001/08/03/stories/1303140n.htm|archive-date=9 January 2009 }}</ref> her parents enrolled her at the [[Guildhall School of Music and Drama]] in London. By the time she reached her teens, she had learned to play the [[piano]], [[recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], and the [[violin]]. She later studied law at [[Birkbeck, University of London]], while working as a literary agent. She never completed the degree, deciding instead to take up music full-time.

==Career==

===1995–1996: Early recordings===
In 1995, Dido began recording 10 demo tracks which were put together on a collection entitled ''[[Odds & Ends (album)|Odds & Ends]]'' and sent out by [[Nettwerk]] management. Nettwerk had signed her after she was brought to their attention by her collaborations with [[Faithless]], the UK dance act spearheaded by her brother, [[Rollo Armstrong]] (Dido co-wrote and provided vocals for album tracks, such as "Flowerstand Man" and "Hem of His Garment"). The collection was released by Nettwerk on CD-R acetate in 1995 and featured a mixture of finished productions and demo versions which she later considered for release on her 1999 debut album, ''[[No Angel (album)|No Angel]]''. ''Odds & Ends'' brought her to the attention of A&R [[Peter Edge]] at [[Arista Records]], who signed her in the US in late 1996, and negotiated a co-sign deal with her brother's independent record label, [[Cheeky Records]].<ref name="hitquarters">{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Peter_Leak_int.html |title=Interview with Peter Leak |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=13 December 2004 |access-date=24 June 2012 |archive-date=18 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318050659/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_Peter_Leak_int.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Of the tracks included on ''Odds & Ends'', "Take My Hand" was included on all editions of ''No Angel'' as a bonus track; "Sweet Eyed Baby" was remixed and renamed to "Don't Think of Me", while "Worthless" and "Me" were released exclusively on the Japanese edition. Peter Leak became Dido's manager during the recording of ''No Angel'' after Edge played some of the in-progress recordings and been "blown away" by them.<ref name="hitquarters"/>

===1998–2002: ''No Angel'' and breakthrough===
Cheeky Records, to which Dido was signed, was sold to BMG records in 1999. This delayed the release of the album ''No Angel'' in the United Kingdom, but also allowed her to concentrate on promoting ''No Angel'' in the United States, including a slot on [[Sarah McLachlan]]'s [[Lilith Fair]] tour. Through touring, both before and after the album was available, Dido's music began to receive more exposure. The first official single chosen by Dido and her label, "[[Here with Me (Dido song)|Here with Me]]", initially struggled to make an impact on radio, but while the label were considering switching to an alternative track, the song made a breakthrough as a result of its use in television programme ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]''.<ref name="hitquarters"/> The song was used as the theme music of the show, but it was actually when it was played in its entirety during the season finale that it really made an impact with audiences.<ref name="hitquarters"/>

Manager Peter Leak told [[HitQuarters]] that sales jumped from 2,000 to 9,000 units during the week of the show's transmission.<ref name="hitquarters"/> Arguably it was this, as well as the airplay on MTV throughout Europe of the single's video, which brought her mass attention. Subsequently, the song was used in the British romantic comedy ''[[Love Actually]]''. In 1998, the music producer for the film ''[[Sliding Doors]]'' picked her track "[[Thank You (Dido song)|Thank You]]" for the soundtrack. ''No Angel'' was released in 1999, and Dido toured extensively to promote the record.

American rapper [[Eminem]] helped introduce Dido to a US audience in 2000 when he received permission from Dido herself to sample the first verse of "Thank You" in his hit single "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]". Dido also appeared in the music video as Stan's pregnant girlfriend. She did not want to do the video at first, as she was uncomfortable with the scene in the video where she had to be tied up and have her mouth covered with duct tape, but later agreed to it and got along well with Eminem and the crew on set. In North America, the video usually aired with the trunk scene censored.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gigwise.com/photos/47455/10/The-50-Most-Shocking-Music-Videos-Ever |title=The 50 Most Shocking Music Videos Ever! |work=Gigwise |date=12 November 2008 |access-date=31 December 2011 |archive-date=6 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506112401/http://www.gigwise.com/photos/47455/10/the-50-most-shocking-music-videos-ever |url-status=live }}</ref> Interest soared in her debut album, leading it to hit charts in Europe on import sales alone, charting in the top five on the [[UK Albums Chart]] before its official UK re-release.

''[[No Angel (album)|No Angel]]'' went on to become the top-selling album of 2001 worldwide,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.didomusic.com/music/no-angel |title=No Angel (Album) |publisher=Dido's Official Website |access-date=16 December 2008 |archive-date=22 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522171238/http://www.didomusic.com/music/no-angel |url-status=live }}</ref> debuting at, and returning to, number one in the official [[2001 in British music#Charts|UK Albums Chart]] many times throughout the year. It spawned two top ten hit singles, "Here with Me" and "Thank You", a further top twenty hit, "[[Hunter (Dido song)|Hunter]]" and a fourth and final single release "All You Want" which reached the top 25. It was certified platinum in over thirty-five countries, and is estimated to have sold over [[List of best-selling albums#20–29 million copies|21&nbsp;million copies]] worldwide.<ref name="timesonline2005"/>
Dido's widely emulated hairstyle at this time became known as the "[[Dido flip]]". Her sold-out worldwide tour featured hip-hop artist [[Pete Miser]] as her live band's DJ. ''No Angel'' claimed No. 97 according to the Decade-end Album Chart by ''Billboard''.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/billboard-200-albums?year=2009&begin=81&order=position] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060408145647/http://www.billboard.com/#/charts-decade-end/billboard-200-albums?year=2009&begin=81&order=position |date=8 April 2006}}</ref>

===2003–2005: ''Life for Rent'' and Live 8===

''[[Life for Rent]]'' was released in 2003. Preceded by the hit single "[[White Flag (Dido song)|White Flag]]", the album sold over 152,000 copies in the first day alone in the UK, and went on to sell over 400,000 in the first week. Three further singles—"[[Life for Rent (song)|Life for Rent]]", "[[Don't Leave Home]]" and "[[Sand in My Shoes]]"—were lifted from the album, with Dido embarking on a worldwide tour in support of the album (a DVD of footage from the tour was released in 2005 entitled ''[[Live at Brixton Academy (Dido album)|Live at Brixton Academy]]'').

Following her sold-out world tour of 2004, Dido was asked to perform at three of the [[Live 8]] concerts on 2 July 2005—performing in [[Live 8 concert, London|London]], then at the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project|Eden Project]] in Cornwall, before flying over to [[Live 8 concert, Paris|Paris]], performing both solo ("White Flag") and duetting with [[Youssou N'Dour]] ("Thank You" and "Seven Seconds").

Also in 2005, Dido provided vocals for her brother's side project [[Dusted (British band)|Dusted]] on the album ''[[Safe from Harm]]''. She sings on the tracks: "Time Takes Time", "Hurt U" and "Winter" and she co-wrote three tracks on the album: "Always Remember to Respect & Honour Your Mother, Part 1", "The Biggest Fool in the World" and "Winter".

===2006–2008: ''Safe Trip Home'' and hiatus===
Dido's third album, ''[[Safe Trip Home]]'', was released in November 2008. The album, which Dido began work on in October 2005, was produced by [[Jon Brion]] and Dido herself and features contributions from [[Brian Eno]],<ref name=Q_interview>{{Cite news|author=John Aizlewood|title=Dido – Untitled: Expected Early 2008|magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=October 2007}}</ref> [[Questlove]], [[Mick Fleetwood]], [[Rollo Armstrong]], and [[Matt Chamberlain]]. Recording sessions were held at [[Abbey Road Studios|London's Abbey Road]] and at [[Jon Brion]]'s home studio in Los Angeles. During production of the album, Dido attended evening classes in music and English at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7676909.stm |title=Entertainment &#124; Singer Dido takes music lessons |work=BBC News |date=27 October 2008 |access-date=24 January 2011 |archive-date=30 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081030224625/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7676909.stm |url-status=live }}</ref> The first single from the album, "[[Don't Believe in Love]]", was released in October 2008, and a track titled "[[Look No Further]]" was made available to download from her official website for a limited time.
