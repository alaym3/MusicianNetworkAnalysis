'''Sinan Sakić''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Синан Сакић}}; 13 October 1956 – 1 June 2018)<ref name=death>{{cite web |title=Sinan Sakic passed away: A famous singer lost a battle with severe illness |url=http://www.telegraf.rs/jetset/vesti-jetset/2963224-preminuo-sinan-sakic-poznati-pevac-izgubio-bitku-sa-teskom-bolescu |website=Telegraf |access-date=1 June 2018 |language=sr |date=1 June 2018}}</ref> was a [[Serbia]]n [[pop-folk]] singer.

Sakić first reached massive popularity as a member of the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[turbo-folk]] band, [[Južni Vetar]] (''Southern Wind''). He also went on to have a successful career as a solo artist. Sakić was one of the most successful artists in the [[Yugoslavia|ex-Yugoslavia]] region.

==Early life==
Sinan Sakić was born in [[Loznica]], [[People's Republic of Serbia|PR Serbia]], [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia|FPR Yugoslavia]] on 13 October 1956. Sakić was born into a poor family. His mother, Đulka, worked at a factory, and his father, Rašid, was a member of the military orchestra and later, the [[Belgrade Philharmonic Orchestra]] and [[Zagreb Philharmonic Orchestra]]. As a result, Sakić showed an interest in music from a young age. He was especially fascinated by the piano, however, his father believed that it would be of no use to him.

==Career==
When Sakić was only 13 years old, he was a drummer for a folk band. Later on, he played with the bassist Bratislav Braca Dinkić. He was a drummer until 1984.

In the late 1970s, by profession, Sakić was a welder; however, he also worked as a waiter in a [[kafana]]. Sakić did not believe in his own singing abilities. If it wasn't for a customer who offered him 500 [[Yugoslav Dinar|Dinars]] to hear him sing, Sakić would not have pursued a musical career. The customer was amazed by his voice. From then on, Sakić decided to perform folk music and to learn popular folk songs. Sakić aimed to learn 5 songs a day. In his repertoire, he included songs by popular artists such as [[Toma Zdravkovic|Toma Zdravković]], [[Saban Saulic|Šaban Šaulić]] and [[Zdravko Colic|Zdravko Čolić]].

Sakić launched his singing career in 1978 with the singles, ''Sreli Smo Se Mnogo Kasno'' and ''Jedna Tuga Za Dva Druga''.

Sakić gained popularity in the 1980s, as a vocalist in the Yugoslavian musical act, [[Južni Vetar]]; alongside [[Dragana Mirković]], [[Mile Kitić]], [[Šemsa Suljaković]] and [[Kemal Malovčić]].<ref name="Rasmussen2002">{{cite book|author=Ljerka V. Rasmussen|title=Newly Composed Folk Music of Yugoslavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H6XtL6XNO9oC&pg=PA140|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-93966-9|pages=140–}}</ref> He was a member from 1982 until 1991. He left due to the hospitalisation of Miodrag Mile Ilić (Mile Bas), the bassist of Južni Vetar. While Ilić was hospitalised, Sakić recorded two albums under the production of Zoran Starčević; ''Ljubila Me Žena Ta'' (1992) and ''Korak Do Sna'' (1993). Once Ilić had recovered, Sakić rejoined Južni Vetar and recorded another 7 albums; ''U Meni Potraži Spas'' (1994), ''Ruža i Trn'' (1995), ''Zoko, Moja Zoko'' (1996), ''Dodirni Me'' (1997), ''Drž' Se Mile Još Si Živ'' (1998) and ''Ne, Ne Daj Da Te Ljubi'' (2001).

After 17 albums with Miodrag M. Ilić, Perica Zdravković, Sava Bojić and Branislav Vasić, Sakić once again left Južni Vetar.

Sakić's career began to stagnate in the 2010s due to alcohol problems which caused his health to deteriorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kurir.rs/stars/1866067/sinan-sakic-ne-stidim-se-sto-su-me-uhvatili-s-drogom|title=Sinan Sakic: Ne stidim se sto su me ohvatili s drogom|website=www.kurir.rs}}</ref> In 2014, Sakić performed his signature songs, ''Lepa Do Bola'' and ''Ej, Od Kad Sam Se Rodio'' on [[Zvezde Granda]]. Due to his increasingly poor health, his last album, ''Jedina'', was released that same year.

==Personal life==
At the age of 18, after serving his mandatory stint in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] in [[Pula]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]], Sakić married his first wife, Velida Milkić. Together, they had two sons, Rašid and Medo. The former is currently imprisoned on murder charges and the latter is a singer. Sinan and Velida later divorced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vipstarsevents.eu/sinan-i-sabina-sakic-setili-se-svog-vencanja-foto/|title=Sinan i Sabina Sakić setili se svog venčanja!

Sabina already had two sons, Ernest and Elvis, from her previous marriage.
