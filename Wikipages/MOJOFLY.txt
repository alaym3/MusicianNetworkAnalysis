'''MOJOFLY''' is a pop-rock band from the [[Philippines]].

Formed in 1999 by bassist Ricci Gurango after his departure from [[Hungry Young Poets]], MOJOFLY reeled in mainstream and alternative crowds alike with the debut album ''Birth Day'' (1999) and follow-up ''A Million Stories'' (2002), both released under Sony BMG Philippines. Then-lead singer [[Kitchie Nadal]] helped propel singles such as ''Another Day'' and ''Scooter Boy'' to national recognition. But in May 2003, Nadal left the group to embark on a solo career.

Mojofly then introduced [[Lougee Basabas]] as the band's new frontwoman in only a matter of days. By year's end the group joined the “indie” bandwagon with their self-titled EP, sold-out despite being available only in gigs. Because of ''Mata'' and the revived, revv-ed up Lougee-version of ''Minamalas'', ''MOJOFLY (EP)'' showed the new sound of their group.

The band went on to release an LP aptly entitled ''MOJOFLY Now'' (June, 2005), still under independent label luKas Music of artist manager and music publisher Karin Araneta. This time distributed nationwide by EMI Music Philippines, Lougee took over the reins in songwriting and gained MOJOFLY “street cred” through her novel, cutting-edge compositions. Currently promoting ''MOJOFLY Now Special Edition'' (August, 2006), the 2-disc package marries the original ‘05 full-length and an A-VCD featuring live tracks from their first major concert at the Music Museum (September, 2005) and the 3D-animated music video of ''Tumatakbo''.

MOJOFLY is the first local artist to venture into full 3D animation in Philippine music video history. The work was previewed at the ''19th Singapore International Film Festival'' (April, 2006) and won ''Best Animated Video'' and ''Favorite Indie Video'' at the ''MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards 2006]'' (August, 2006).

Apart from once garnering the much-coveted slot for ''MTV Lokal Artist-of-the-Month'' (March, 2005), MOJOFLY also boasts a list of celebrity endorsements from ''Del Monte Pizza Sauce'' to ''Penshoppe'' and ''Cream Silk Conditioners''. The theme song ''Choose'' and vast multi-media exposure from the Cream Silk “Girl Power, Pink Power” campaign brought MOJOFLY's sound and Lougee's vivid image into every household.

On 2008, bassist - Ricci Gurango, departed from the band. The remaining members (Lougee and Ali) took in Richard Carandang and Ace Evangelista to play the bass and lead guitar respectively. With the new members, the band decided to rename their group as ''[[DeLara]]''.

DeLara remained active from 2008-2011 and produced 2 studio albums (self-titled "DeLara", 2008 and "Just Free", 2010). After the separation of the band, Lougee Basabas went on to pursue a solo career performing in local venues and events. Shortly after, she auditioned for "[[The Voice of the Philippines]]" season 2 on [[ABS-CBN]] in 2014 and became part of Team [[Bamboo Mañalac|Bamboo]]. A year later, Lougee married Ali Alejandro (Mojofly drummer since 2004)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/116384-ali-alejandro-lougee-basabas-balesin-wedding|title = IN PHOTOS: Ali Alejandro and Lougee Basabas' Balesin wedding}}</ref> and were blessed with a baby boy named Leon in 2016.

In 2015, Mojofly started to perform in small production events but was not publicly announcing their return to the local performing circuit yet. It was only later in the same year that they started to record their 4th studio album (2nd studio album with the 2nd generation Mojofly members Ali & Lougee) with Yellow Room Music Philippines, headed by Monty Macalino (vocalist of [[Mayonnaise (band)]]). The band was able to release 1 single entitled "Rally" in May 2018 for online and streaming platforms invoking that Mojofly is back with members Kiko Montecillo on Keyboards, Beejay Valera on Lead Guitars, and Mark Reese Gelbolingo on Bass.

Last March 2019,  Mojofly released their latest 8-track album entitled "Mula Noon". 

They also have two new songs recorded during the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic, "KAPIT-LAPIT" and "PWEDE NAMAN" which you can listen to in Spotify, Apple Music, and all music streaming platforms.

Their 2005 hit song ‘Tumatakbo’ which won Best Animated Video in the MTV Awards back in ‘05 is now the theme song of the new Fantasy-Drama series entitled "The Lost Recipe" which aired last January 18, 2021 on GMA 7 Network.
