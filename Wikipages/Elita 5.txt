==Career==
The band formed in 1988 in the town of [[Tetovo]], [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], although their first recording was published as an album titled ''Elita 5'' in 1990.<ref name="arif" />

They have repeatedly refused to play in competitive festivals stating that "the band does not belong in festivals", preferring concerts instead.
  
In a 2001 concert, the band had opened in [[Tirana]], [[Albania]] for the German heavy metal band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], the vocalist Arif Ziberi in an interview noted that this was one of the most exciting moments in his life.<ref name="arif">{{cite web |url=http://www.visit-ulcinj.com/blog/2012/09/14/arif-ziberi-i-elita-5-fama-me-ka-prishur-pune-me-gruan/ |title=Arif Ziberi i "Elita 5": Fama më ka prishur punë me gruan |website=visit-ulcinj.com |publisher=Paloma |language=Albanian |access-date=March 16, 2017}}</ref>
