== Early life ==
Van Etten was born in Belleville, New Jersey, the middle child of five.<ref name = "NYT">{{Cite news|last=Coscarelli|first=Joe|date=2019-01-03|title=The Many Lives of Sharon Van Etten|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/arts/music/sharon-van-etten-remind-me-tomorrow-interview.html|access-date=2020-06-14|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> She lived in Nutley, New Jersey, then moved to Clinton, New Jersey as a pre-teen. She attended [[North Hunterdon High School]], at which she participated in the chorus and performed in stage musicals.<ref>Kaplan, Ilana.

Accessed August 14, 2019. "The New Jersey native joined her first choir at 11 while attending Yantacaw school and continued choral singing at North Hunterdon High School, where she also performed in such musicals as ''West Side Story'', ''Hello Dolly!'' and ''Fiddler on the Roof.''"</ref>

Later, she moved to Murfreesboro, Tennessee to attend [[Middle Tennessee State University]] and studied recording, but dropped out after a year. She ended up working at the Red Rose, a coffee and record shop and music venue in Murfreesboro for about five years. She fell into an abusive relationship with a rock musician who discouraged her from writing songs. After five years, she left in the middle of the night with whatever she could carry. She showed up to her parents' house on Thanksgiving Day and her mother answered the door, holding the dishes she was about to put on the table, to find her black-sheep middle child, who hadn’t spoken to her in ages, standing on the doorstep.<ref name=NYTimes-RoughHarm-2012/>

In 2004, she moved back to New Jersey, where she worked at Perryville Wine and Spirits, then moved to New York City in 2005. She lived in Brooklyn for a number of years, in the suburban neighborhood of Ditmas Park.<ref name=NYTimes-RoughHarm-2012/>

== Influences and musical style ==
Van Etten cites [[Ani DiFranco]] as a key influence, saying, "She was the first musician I had ever heard whose songs were super confessional. She could really play guitar...
