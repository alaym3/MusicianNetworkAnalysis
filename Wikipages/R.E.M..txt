'''R.E.M.''' was an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Athens, Georgia]], formed in 1980 by drummer [[Bill Berry]], guitarist [[Peter Buck]], bassist [[Mike Mills]], and lead vocalist [[Michael Stipe]], who were students at the [[University of Georgia]]. Liner notes from some of the band's albums list attorney [[Bertis Downs]] and manager [[Jefferson Holt]] as non-musical members. One of the first [[alternative rock]] bands, R.E.M. was noted for Buck's ringing, [[arpeggiated]] guitar style; Stipe's distinctive vocal quality, unique stage presence, and obscure lyrics; Mills's melodic bass lines and backing vocals; and Berry's tight, economical drumming style. In the early 1990s, other alternative rock acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] viewed R.E.M. as a pioneer of the genre. After Berry left the band in 1997, the band continued its career in the 2000s with mixed critical and commercial success. The band broke up amicably in 2011 with members devoting time to solo projects after having sold more than 85 million albums worldwide and becoming one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|world's best-selling music acts]].

R.E.M. released its first single, "[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]", in 1981 on the independent record label [[Hib-Tone]]. It was followed by the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' [[Extended play|EP]] in 1982, the band's first release on [[I.R.S. Records]]. In 1983, the group released its critically acclaimed debut album, ''[[Murmur (album)|Murmur]]'', and built its reputation over the next few years through releases every year from 1984 to 1988: ''[[Reckoning (R.E.M. album)|Reckoning]]'', ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'', ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'', ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' and ''[[Green (R.E.M. album)|Green]]'', including an intermittent b-side compilation ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]''. [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]] and [[Mitch Easter]] produced their first two albums, [[Joe Boyd]] handled production on ''Fables of the Reconstruction'' and [[Don Gehman]] produced ''Lifes Rich Pageant.'' Thereafter, R.E.M. settled on [[Scott Litt]] as producer for the next 10{{nbsp}}years during the band's most successful period of their career. They also started co-producing their material and playing other instruments in the studio apart from the main ones they play. With constant touring, and the support of [[campus radio|college radio]] following years of underground success, R.E.M. achieved a mainstream hit with the 1987 single "[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]". The group signed to [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 1988, and began to espouse political and environmental concerns while playing large arenas worldwide.

R.E.M.'s most commercially successful albums, ''[[Out of Time (album)|Out of Time]]'' (1991) and ''[[Automatic for the People]]'' (1992), put them in the vanguard of alternative rock just as it was becoming mainstream. ''Out of Time'' received seven nominations at the [[34th Annual Grammy Awards]], and lead single "[[Losing My Religion]]", was R.E.M.'s highest-charting and best-selling hit. ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' (1994) continued its run of success. The band began its first tour in six years to support the album; the tour was marred by medical emergencies suffered by three of the band members. In 1996, R.E.M. re-signed with Warner Bros. for a reported US$80&nbsp;million, at the time the most expensive recording contract ever. The tour was productive and the band recorded the following album mostly during soundchecks. The resulting record, ''[[New Adventures in Hi-Fi]]'' (1996), is hailed as the band's last great album and the members' favorite, growing in cult status over the years. Berry left the band the following year, and Stipe, Buck, and Mills continued as a musical trio, supplemented by studio and live musicians, such as multi-instrumentalists [[Scott McCaughey]] and [[Ken Stringfellow]] and drummers [[Joey Waronker]] and [[Bill Rieflin]]. They also parted ways with their longtime manager Jefferson Holt and band's attorney Bertis Downs assumed managerial duties. Seeking to also renovate their sound, the band stopped working with Scott Litt, co-producer and contributor to six of their studio albums and hired [[Pat McCarthy (record producer)|Pat McCarthy]] as co-producer, who had participated before that as mixer and engineer on their last two albums.

After the electronic experimental direction of ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]'' (1998) that was commercially unsuccessful, ''[[Reveal (R.E.M. album)|Reveal]]'' (2001) was referred to as "a conscious return to their classic sound"<ref name="amgreveal">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/reveal-mw0000586964 |title=''Reveal'' – R.E.M. |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 31, 2020 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> which received general acclaim. In 2007, the band was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], in its first year of eligibility and Berry reunited with the band for the ceremony and to record a cover of [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Number 9 Dream|#9 Dream]]" for the compilation album ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]'' to benefit [[Amnesty International]]'s campaign to alleviate the [[Darfur conflict]]. Looking for a change of sound after lukewarm reception for ''[[Around the Sun]]'' (2004), the band collaborated with co-producer [[Jacknife Lee]] on their last two studio albums—the well-received ''[[Accelerate (R.E.M. album)|Accelerate]]'' (2008) and ''[[Collapse into Now]]'' (2011)—as well as their first live albums after decades of touring. R.E.M. disbanded amicably in September 2011, with former members having continued with various musical projects, and several live and archival albums have since been released.

==History==
===1980–1982: Formation and first releases===
In January 1980, [[Peter Buck]] met [[Michael Stipe]] in [[Wuxtry Records]], the Athens record store where Buck worked. The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in [[punk rock]] and [[proto-punk]] artists like [[Patti Smith]], [[Television (band)|Television]], and [[the Velvet Underground]]. Stipe said, "It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself."<ref name="Gumprecht">{{cite journal|author=Blake Gumprecht|title=Interview with R.E.M.|journal= Alternative America (Fanzine)|date=Winter 1983}}</ref> Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien,<ref name=salon>{{cite web |url=https://www.salon.com/2018/04/28/rem-plays-its-first-ever-show/ |title=R.E.M.'s first ever show: Opening band at a birthday party in a church |last=Niimi |first=J |date=April 28, 2018 |website=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |access-date=April 29, 2018}}</ref> Stipe and Buck then met fellow [[University of Georgia]] students [[Bill Berry]] and [[Mike Mills]],<ref>{{cite journal|author=Bill Holdship|title= R.E.M.: Rock Reconstruction Getting There|journal= [[Creem]]|date= September 1985}}</ref> who had played music together since high school<ref>{{cite book|page=30 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> and lived together in Georgia.<ref name="leavell">{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/news/2016/12/09/q-a-the-progressive-global-agency-president-buck.html |title=Q&A: The Progressive Global Agency President Buck Williams talks Widespread Panic, R.E.M., Chuck Leavell  |author=Phil W.

Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist. The group toured in an old blue van driven by Holt, and lived on a food allowance of $2 each per day.<ref>{{cite book|pages=53–54 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref>

During April 1981, R.E.M. recorded its first single, "[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]", at producer [[Mitch Easter]]'s Drive-In Studios in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]]. Initially distributing it as a four-track demo tape to clubs, record labels and magazines, the single was released in July 1981 on the local [[independent record label]] [[Hib-Tone]] with an initial pressing of 1,000 copies—600 of which were sent out as promotional copies. The single quickly sold out, and another 6,000 copies were pressed due to popular demand, despite the original pressing leaving off the record label's contact details.<ref>{{cite book|page= [https://archive.org/details/talkaboutpassion00sull/page/27 27]|author= Denise Sullivan|title= Talk About the Passion: R.E.M.: An Oral Biography|publisher= Underwood-Miller|date= 1994|isbn= 0-88733-184-X|url= https://archive.org/details/talkaboutpassion00sull/page/27}}</ref><ref name=salon /> Despite its limited pressing, the single garnered critical acclaim, and was listed as one of the ten best singles of the year by ''[[The New York Times]]''.<ref>{{cite book|page=497 |author=Marcus Gray|title= It Crawled from the South: An R.E.M.

R.E.M. recorded the ''[[Chronic Town]]'' EP with Mitch Easter in October 1981, and planned to release it on a new indie label named Dasht Hopes.<ref>{{cite book|page=59 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> However, [[I.R.S.

===1982–1988: I.R.S. Records and cult success===
I.R.S. first paired R.E.M. with producer [[Stephen Hague]] to record its debut album. Hague's emphasis on technical perfection left the band unsatisfied, and the band members asked the label to let them record with Easter.<ref>{{cite book|page=72 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> I.R.S. agreed to a "tryout" session, allowing the band to return to [[North Carolina]] and record the song "Pilgrimage" with Easter and producing partner [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]].

The band's third album, ''[[Fables of the Reconstruction]]'' (1985), demonstrated a change in direction. Instead of Dixon and Easter, R.E.M. chose producer [[Joe Boyd]], who had worked with [[Fairport Convention]] and [[Nick Drake]], to record the album in England. The band members found the sessions unexpectedly difficult, and were miserable due to the cold winter weather and what they considered to be poor food;<ref>{{cite book|pages=131–132 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> the situation brought the band to the verge of break-up.<ref>{{cite book|page=135 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> The gloominess surrounding the sessions worked its way into the context for the album's themes. Lyrically, Stipe began to create storylines in the mode of [[Southern Gothic|Southern mythology]], noting in a 1985 interview that he was inspired by "the whole idea of the old men sitting around the fire, passing on&nbsp;...&nbsp;legends and fables to the grandchildren".<ref>"Interview with R.E.M.".

They toured Canada in July and August 1985, and Europe in October of that year, including the Netherlands, England (including one concert at London's [[Hammersmith Palais]]), Ireland, Scotland, France, Switzerland, Belgium and West Germany.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://members.iinet.net.au/~darryl74/1985.html |author=Darryl White |title= 1985 Concert Chronology |publisher= R.E.M.

For its fourth album, R.E.M. enlisted [[John Mellencamp]]'s producer [[Don Gehman]]. The result, ''[[Lifes Rich Pageant]]'' (1986), featured Stipe's vocals closer to the forefront of the music. In a 1986 interview with the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', Peter Buck related, "Michael is getting better at what he's doing, and he's getting more confident at it. And I think that shows up in the projection of his voice."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Tom Popson|title= Onward and Upward and Please Yourself|journal= [[Chicago Tribune]]|date= October 17, 1986}}</ref> The album improved markedly upon the sales of ''Fables of the Reconstruction'' and reached number 21 on the ''Billboard'' album chart. The single "[[Fall on Me (R.E.M. song)|Fall on Me]]" also picked up support on commercial radio.<ref>{{cite book|page=151 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> The album was the band's first to be certified gold for selling 500,000 copies.<ref>{{cite book|page=142 |author=Tony Fletcher|title= Remarks Remade: The Story of R.E.M.|publisher= Omnibus|date= 2002|isbn= 0-7119-9113-8}}</ref> While American college radio remained R.E.M.'s core support, the band was beginning to chart hits on mainstream rock formats; however, the music still encountered resistance from [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 radio]].<ref>{{cite book|page=160 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref>

Following the success of ''Lifes Rich Pageant'', I.R.S. issued ''[[Dead Letter Office (album)|Dead Letter Office]]'', a compilation of tracks recorded by the band during their album sessions, many of which had either been issued as [[B-side]]s or left unreleased altogether. Shortly thereafter, I.R.S. compiled R.E.M.'s music video catalog (except "Wolves, Lower") as the band's first video release, ''[[Succumbs]]''.

Don Gehman was unable to produce R.E.M.'s fifth album, so he suggested the group work with [[Scott Litt]].<ref>{{cite book|page=146 |author=Tony Fletcher|title= Remarks Remade: The Story of R.E.M.|publisher= Omnibus|date= 2002|isbn= 0-7119-9113-8}}</ref> Litt would be the producer for the band's next five albums. ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' (1987) featured some of Stipe's most openly political lyrics, particularly on "Welcome to the Occupation" and "Exhuming McCarthy", which were reactions to the [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political environment of the 1980s under American president [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>{{cite journal|author=Harold De Muir|title=There's No Reason It Shouldn't Be A Hit|journal= East Coast Rocker|date= July 10, 1987}}</ref> [[Jon Pareles]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in his review of the album, "{{'}}''Document''{{'}} is both confident and defiant; if R.E.M. is about to move from cult-band status to mass popularity, the album decrees that the band will get there on its own terms."<ref>{{cite news | author=Jon Pareles | date = September 13, 1987| title=R.E.M. conjures dark times on 'Document' |work=[[The New York Times]] | url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD7143CF930A2575AC0A961948260 | access-date=December 30, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080111010845/http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DEFD7143CF930A2575AC0A961948260 |archive-date = January 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Document'' was R.E.M.'s breakthrough album, and the first single "[[The One I Love (R.E.M. song)|The One I Love]]" charted in the Top 20 in the US, UK, and Canada.<ref name="charts and sales" /> By January 1988, ''Document'' had become the group's first album to sell a million copies.<ref>{{cite book|page=157 |author=Tony Fletcher|title= Remarks Remade: The Story of R.E.M.|publisher= Omnibus|date= 2002|isbn= 0-7119-9113-8}}</ref> In light of the band's breakthrough, the December 1987 cover of ''Rolling Stone'' declared R.E.M.

After spending some months off, R.E.M. returned to the studio in 1991 to record its next album. Late in 1992, the band released ''[[Automatic for the People]]''. Though the group had intended to make a harder-rocking album after the softer textures of ''Out of Time'',<ref>{{cite book|page=216 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> the somber ''Automatic for the People'' "[seemed] to move at an even more agonized crawl", according to ''[[Melody Maker]]''.<ref name="remote control">{{cite journal|author=David Fricke|title= Living Up to ''Out of Time''/Remote Control: Parts I and II|journal=[[Melody Maker]]|date= October 3, 1992|author-link= David Fricke}}</ref> The album dealt with themes of loss and mourning inspired by "that sense of&nbsp;... turning thirty", according to Buck.<ref>{{cite book|page=218 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> Several songs featured [[string instrument|string]] [[arrangement]]s by former [[Led Zeppelin]] bassist [[John Paul Jones (musician)|John Paul Jones]].

After the band released two slow-paced albums in a row, R.E.M.'s 1994 album ''[[Monster (R.E.M. album)|Monster]]'' was, as Buck said, "a 'rock' record, with the rock in quotation marks." In contrast to the sound of its predecessors, the music of ''Monster'' consisted of distorted guitar tones, minimal overdubs, and touches of 1970s [[glam rock]].<ref>{{cite book|page=236 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> Like ''Out of Time'', ''Monster'' topped the charts in both the US and UK.<ref name="charts and sales" /> The record sold about nine million copies worldwide.<ref name="album sales" /> The singles "[[What's the Frequency, Kenneth?]]" and "[[Bang and Blame]]" were the band's last American Top 40 hits, although all the singles from ''Monster'' reached the Top 30 on the British charts.<ref name="charts and sales" /> Warner Bros. assembled the music videos from the album as well as those from ''Automatic for the People'' for release as ''[[Parallel (video)|Parallel]]'' in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|page=270 |author=Tony Fletcher|title= Remarks Remade: The Story of R.E.M.|publisher= Omnibus|date= 2002|isbn= 0-7119-9113-8}}</ref>

In January 1995, R.E.M. set out on its first tour in six years. The tour was a huge commercial success, but the period was difficult for the group.<ref>{{cite book|page=248 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> On March 1, Berry collapsed on stage during a performance in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]], having suffered a [[brain aneurysm]].

Stipe later called chorus lyrics of "[[Sitting Still]]" from R.E.M. debut album, ''Murmur'', "nonsense", saying in a 1994 online chat, "You all know there aren't words, ''per se'', to a lot of the early stuff.

[[File:Peter Buck Manchester - 2008.jpg|alt=Peter Buck playing guitar and smiling|thumb|left|Peter Buck's guitar-playing style has defined R.E.M.'s sound]]

Peter Buck's style of playing guitar has been singled out by many as the most distinctive aspect of R.E.M.'s music. During the 1980s, Buck's "economical, arpeggiated, poetic" style reminded British music journalists of 1960s American [[folk rock]] band [[the Byrds]].<ref>{{cite book|page=77 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> Buck has stated "[Byrds guitarist] [[Roger McGuinn]] was a big influence on me as a guitar player",<ref name="Buckley81">{{cite book|page=81 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> but said it was Byrds-influenced bands, including [[Big Star]] and [[the Soft Boys]], that inspired him more.<ref name="Fletcher p115">{{cite book|page=115 |author=Tony Fletcher|title= Remarks Remade: The Story of R.E.M.|publisher= Omnibus|date= 2002|isbn= 0-7119-9113-8}}</ref> Comparisons were also made with the guitar playing of [[Johnny Marr]] of alternative rock contemporaries [[the Smiths]]. While Buck professed being a fan of the group, he admitted he initially criticized the band simply because he was tired of fans asking him if he was influenced by Marr,<ref name="date" /> whose band had in fact made their debut after R.E.M.<ref name="Fletcher p115" /> Buck generally eschews guitar solos; he explained in 2002, "I know that when guitarists rip into this hot solo, people go nuts, but I don't write songs that suit that, and I am not interested in that. I can do it if I have to, but I don't like it."<ref>{{cite book|page=80 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> Mike Mills' melodic approach to bass playing is inspired by [[Paul McCartney]] of [[the Beatles]] and [[Chris Squire]] of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]; Mills has said, "I always played a melodic bass, like a piano bass in some ways . . . I never wanted to play the traditional locked into the [[kick drum]], [[root note]] bass work."<ref>{{cite book|page=105 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> Mills has more musical training than his bandmates, which he has said "made it easier to turn abstract musical ideas into reality."<ref name="Buckley81" />

==Legacy==
[[File:Pavement, the band, in Tokyo.jpg|alt=Pavement members standing before a brick wall posing in a black-and-white photo|thumb|[[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], one of several bands to name R.E.M. as an influence&mdash;they even wrote the song "Unseen Power of the Picket Fence" in honor of them]]

R.E.M. was pivotal in the creation and development of the alternative rock genre. [[AllMusic]] stated, "R.E.M. mark the point when [[post-punk]] turned into alternative rock."<ref name="allmusic" /> In the early 1980s, the musical style of R.E.M. stood in contrast to the post-punk and [[New wave music|new wave]] genres that had preceded it. Music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] noted that the post-punk movement of the late 1970s and early 1980s "had taken whole swaths of music off the menu", particularly that of the 1960s, and that "After postpunk's demystification and New Pop's schematics, it felt liberating to listen to music rooted in mystical awe and blissed-out surrender." Reynolds declared R.E.M., a band that recalled the music of the 1960s with its "plangent guitar chimes and folk-styled vocals" and who "wistfully and abstractly conjured visions and new frontiers for America", one of "the two most important alt-rock bands of the day."<ref>Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978–1984''. Penguin, 2005. {{ISBN |0-14-303672-6}}, p. 392</ref> With the release of ''Murmur'', R.E.M. had the most impact musically and commercially of the developing alternative genre's early groups, leaving in its wake a number of [[jangle pop]] followers.<ref>{{cite web | url={{AllMusic|class=explore|id=essay/american-alternative-rock--post-punk-t578|pure_url=yes}} | title=American Alternative Rock / Post-Punk |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine  | publisher=AllMusic| access-date=December 3, 2010 | author-link=Stephen Thomas Erlewine }}</ref>

R.E.M.'s early breakthrough success served as an inspiration for other alternative bands. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' referred to the "R.E.M. model"—career decisions that R.E.M. made which set guidelines for other underground artists to follow in their own careers. ''Spin's'' Charles Aaron wrote that by 1985, "They'd shown how far an underground, punk-inspired rock band could go within the industry without whoring out its artistic integrity in any obvious way. They'd figured out how to buy in, not sellout-in other words, they'd achieved the American Bohemian Dream."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Charles Aaron|title=The R.E.M. method and other rites of passage|journal=Spin: 20 Years of Alternative Music|publisher= Three Rivers Press|date= 2005|isbn=0-307-23662-5|page= 18}}</ref> [[Steve Wynn (songwriter)|Steve Wynn]] of [[Dream Syndicate]] said, "They invented a whole new ballgame for all of the other bands to follow whether it was [[Sonic Youth]] or [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]] or [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] or [[Butthole Surfers]].

Throughout R.E.M.'s career, its members sought to highlight social and political issues. According to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', R.E.M. was considered to be one of the United States' "most liberal and politically correct rock groups."<ref>{{cite journal|author=Chuck Philips|title=R.E.M.'s Former Manager Denies Allegations of Sex Harassment|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date= June 21, 1996}}</ref> The band's members were "on the same page" politically, sharing a [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] and [[Progressivism|progressive]] outlook.<ref>{{cite book|page=155 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref> Mills admitted that there was occasionally dissension between band members on what causes they might support, but acknowledged "Out of respect for the people who disagree, those discussions tend to stay in-house, just because we'd rather not let people know where the divisions lie, so people can't exploit them for their own purposes." An example is that in 1990 Buck noted that Stipe was involved with [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], but the rest of the band were not.<ref>{{cite book|page=197 |author=David Buckley|title= R.E.M.: Fiction: An Alternative Biography|publisher= Virgin|date= 2002|isbn= 1-85227-927-3}}</ref>

R.E.M. helped raise funds for environmental, feminist and human rights causes, and were involved in campaigns to encourage [[voter registration]].
