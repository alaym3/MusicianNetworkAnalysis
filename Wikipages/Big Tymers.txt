==History==
The duo recorded their first album ''[[How You Luv That]]'' in 1997 featuring all of the rappers on Cash Money Records including [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]] and [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]]. The album reached a peak of No. 25 of the R&B/hip hop chart and the lower reaches of the Billboard 200. Cash Money re-released ''How You Luv That'' as ''[[How You Luv That Vol. 2]]'' in late 1998 after signing its distribution deal with Universal Records. This re-release substitutes a remix of "Stun'n" for the original version and adds "Big Ballin'", "Money & Power", and "Drop It Like It's Hot. ''How You Luv That Vol. 2'' almost reached the top 100 of the Billboard album chart and reached the top 20 of the Billboard R&B and hip hop chart.{{cn|date=September 2019}}

Their second album ''[[I Got That Work]]'' released in 2000 reached the top 5 of the US album chart and topped the US R&B/hip hop chart. This album spawned two big hits in "Get Your Roll On" and "#1 Stunna" reaching the top 30 on the R&B singles charts.

''[[Hood Rich]]'' released in 2002 topped both the US album and R&B charts. "Still Fly" from the album reached the top 20 on the R&B singles charts and No. 11 on the pop charts. "Oh Yeah" reached the top 50 of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 30 of the R&B/hip hop charts.

''[[Big Money Heavyweight]]'' in 2003 was not as successful reaching No. 21 on the album charts and top ten in the R&B charts. A remix album made the lower reaches of the R&B/hip hop charts in 2004. "Gangsta Girl" from the album made the lower reaches of the Billboard Hot 100 and the top 40 of the R&B charts.
