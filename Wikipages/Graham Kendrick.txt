Although now best known as a worship leader and writer of worship songs, Graham Kendrick began his career as a member of the Christian beat group Whispers of Truth (formerly the "Forerunners"). Later, he began working as a solo concert performer and recording artist in the singer/songwriter tradition.  He was closely associated with the organisation Musical Gospel Outreach and recorded several albums for their record labels.  On the first, ''Footsteps on the Sea'', released in 1972, he worked with the virtuoso guitarist [[Gordon Giltrap]].

Kendrick worked for a time as a member of "In the Name of Jesus", a mission team led by [[Clive Calver]]. He was based at [[St Michael le Belfrey, York]] in the late 1970s and was involved in student and university ministry with British [[Youth for Christ]]. At this time he recorded the albums ''Triumph in the Air'' and ''Cresta Run''. Calver went on to run British Youth for Christ and the [[Evangelical Alliance]], and then left the United Kingdom for the [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical Church]] in the United States. Kendrick, however, remained firmly fixed in the UK church as probably the most influential Christian songwriter of his generation.

Kendrick also released "Let the Flame Burn Brighter" as a [[single (music)|single]] in 1989, which reached 55 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

He is a member of [[Compassionart]], a [[Charitable organization|charity]] founded by [[Martin Smith (songwriter)|Martin Smith]] from [[Delirious?]].

In more recent years Kendrick has developed the concept of "Psalm Surfing".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicademy.com/2012/09/graham-kendrick-psalm-surfing-video-worship/|title=Graham Kendrick on Psalm Surfing - video and how-to guide|date=14 September 2012|access-date=12 September 2016}}</ref>

In May 2020 he took part in The UK Blessing, a worship song video collaboration of 65 churches released during the national coronavirus lockdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.salisbury.anglican.org/news/the-uk-blessing-is-exactly-that|title=The 'UK Blessing' is exactly that|date=7 May 2020|website=THE DIOCESE OF SALISBURY|access-date=1 August 2021}}</ref>
