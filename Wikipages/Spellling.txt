==Early life==
Cabral was born in [[Sacramento]], California. She was raised in the [[Catholic Church]], which ended up influencing her music.<ref>{{cite web |last=Fechik|first=Mariel|title=As Above, So Below: SPELLLING on Mythical Realms and New Album 'The Turning Wheel'|date=7 July 2021|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/sttw-spellling-the-turning-wheel-music-interview-2021/|access-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref>  Cabral applied to study Philosophy at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] but only stayed two semesters, citing: "I was hating it, just because of how isolated I felt in the department. I think I was the only person of color in all of my classes, and the only femme person, so it was really isolating. I felt like I was kind of shamed out of the department, to be honest." After she had a class with professor Nadia Ellis, Cabral transferred to English literature. Upon graduating, she pursued an [[Master of Fine Arts|MFA]] at the same university, which she completed in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lee, Ahn|title=SPELLLING on Friendship |url=https://art.berkeley.edu/news/2021/5/3/friendaversary|access-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fechik|first=Mariel|title=As Above, So Below: SPELLLING on Mythical Realms and New Album 'The Turning Wheel'|date=7 July 2021|url=https://atwoodmagazine.com/sttw-spellling-the-turning-wheel-music-interview-2021/|access-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
Cabral started her musical career in 2015, influenced by two events: watching a fellow San Francisco artist performing [[Live looping|looped vocals]]; and the death of a close friend. At the time she was working as a [[elementary schools in the United States|elementary school]] teacher, and being around crayons inspired her to release a handmade CD called ''Crayola Church''. Cabral said about the project: “I took a Crayola box and made a record based on every color in the box… I would wrap the CDs in children’s drawings and write the track listing, so some people have those [editions].”<ref>{{cite web |last=Reyes|first=Jordan|title=How Alien Encounters and Vivid Dreams Inspired Spellling's Stunning ''Mazy Fly'' |date=19 February 2019|url=https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/spellling-interview|access-date=July 9, 2021}}</ref>

In 2017, she self released her debut album ''Pantheon of Me''.
