== Early life==

Music has been in Ardhito's blood since he was a child and he has since been a [[jazz]] lover and a fan of 40s songs. More than just composing songs, he can also play musical instruments such as the guitar, piano and drums. He started composing music since 2013, when he was still studying at [[JMC Academy]], Australia, in the Film Department.<ref name=":1" /> After graduating from JMC Academy, Ardhito worked at his father's company which worked on aircraft maintenance. A year later, Ardhito was selected as Top 6 MTV Indonesia VJ Hunt.

=== 2013–2016 ===

Adrhito first appeared on YouTube in 2013 when he covered [[AJ Rafael]]'s songs such as She Was Mine. A year later after graduating from college, in 2014 to be precise, he began to gain popularity. His first single was titled I Placed My Heart, which was then followed by the song What Do You Feel About Me. The second song became one of the most watched songs on YouTube. However, currently he focuses on YouTube alone, "because YouTube is the most used platform for playing / searching for new music". Apart from being a singer, he had worked at TV stations, as a DJ, to a Barista. Finally decided to become a Full-Time Musician.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.femina.co.id/celebrity/ardhito-pramono-fokus-bermusik-di-youtube|title=Ardhito Pramono, Fokus Bermusik di YouTube|last=Indonesia|first=Femina|website=www.femina.co.id|language=en|access-date=December 24, 2017}}</ref>
