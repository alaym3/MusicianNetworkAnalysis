'''The Overtones''' are a UK based vocal harmony group. They were discovered by a [[Warner Bros. Records]]' talent scout while working as decorators in a shop near [[Oxford Street]], singing during their tea break.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/29/paul-morley-nostalgia-the-overtones|title=Paul Morley's Showing Off... The Overtones|last=Morley|first=Paul|work=The Guardian|date=29 October 2010|accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref> Their first album, ''[[Good Ol' Fashioned Love]]'', entered the [[UK Albums Chart]] at #16 in November 2010.

==History==

The members were originally in a band called DYYCE, which then reformed as Lexi Joe, which formed the basis of The Overtones. With four members originally – Mark Franks, Mike Crawshaw, Darren Everest and Timmy Matley – the band had been performing for several years. The four all shared an interest in the [[doo-wop]] genre of the 1950s mixed with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] and modern [[pop music]]. Their voices bear a strong resemblance to a 1980s' doo-wop boyband, [[14 Karat Soul]]. After auditioning on ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' in 2009, as Lexi Joe, they were rejected from the final 24. Later, they met Lockie Chapman, discovered similar tastes in music and reformed themselves as a five-piece band, under the name of The Overtones. Everest then had the idea of starting a painting and decorating company so that the five could practice together while working. It was while painting a shop near Oxford Street in London that the band was discovered by a talent scout, while singing "[[The Longest Time]]". They later signed a 5-album deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]].<ref name="STV">{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/music/206852-the-overtones-will-support-peter-andre-on-tour/|title=The Overtones will support Peter Andre on tour|work=stv.tv|publisher=STV Group plc|date=4 November 2010|accessdate=17 November 2010}}</ref>
