'''Pen pals''' (or '''penpals''', '''pen-pals''', '''penfriends''' or '''pen friends''') are people who regularly write to each other, particularly via [[postal mail]]. Pen pals are usually strangers whose relationship is based primarily, or even solely, on their exchange of letters. Occasionally, pen pals may already have a relationship that is not regularly conducted in person.

==Purposes==
A pen pal relationship is often used to practice reading and writing in a [[foreign language]], to improve [[literacy]], to learn more about other countries and lifestyles, and to make friendships. While the expansion of the Internet has reduced the number of traditional pen pals,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/6133903/50-things-that-are-being-killed-by-the-internet.html|title=50 things that are being killed by the internet|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Matthew|last=Moore|date=4 September 2009|access-date=20 January 2017}}</ref> pen pal clubs can nowadays be found on the Internet, in magazine columns, newspapers, and sometimes through clubs or special interest groups.

==Organizations==
Many pen pals meet each other through organizations that bring people together for this purpose.

Organizations can be split into three main categories: free, partial subscription, and subscription-based clubs. Free clubs are usually funded by advertising and profiles are not reviewed, whereas subscription-based clubs will usually not contain any advertising and will have an administrator approving profiles to the database.

While the traditional [[Mail|snail mail]] pen pal relationship has fallen into a decline due to modern technology closing the world's communication gap, prison pen pal services have combined technology with traditional letter writing. These sites allow [[prisoner]]s to place pen pal ads online; however, inmates in the United States and most of the world are not permitted to access the Internet. Therefore, the pen pal relationships with inmates are still conducted via postal mail. Other pen pal organizations have survived by embracing the technology of the Internet.
