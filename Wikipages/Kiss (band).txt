'''Kiss'''<!--not all caps per WP:MOSTM--> (often stylized as '''KI''ϟϟ''''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[New York City]] in January 1973 by [[Paul Stanley]], [[Gene Simmons]], [[Ace Frehley]], and [[Peter Criss]]. Well known for its members' face paint and stage outfits, the group rose to prominence in the {{nowrap|mid–late}} 1970s with its [[Shock rock|shocking]] live performances, which featured [[fire breathing]], blood-spitting, smoking guitars, shooting rockets, levitating drum kits, and [[pyrotechnics]]. The band has gone through several lineup changes, with Stanley and Simmons being the only members to feature in every lineup. The original and best-known lineup consists of Stanley (vocals and rhythm guitar), Simmons (vocals and bass), Frehley (lead guitar and vocals), and Criss (drums and vocals).

With their make-up and costumes, the band members took on the personae of comic book-style characters: the Starchild (Stanley), the Demon (Simmons), the Spaceman or Space Ace (Frehley), and the Catman (Criss). Due to creative differences, both Criss and Frehley had departed the group by 1982.

In 1983, Kiss began performing without makeup and costumes, thus marking the beginning of the band's "unmasked" era that would last for over a decade. The band experienced a commercial resurgence during this era, with the [[RIAA certification#List of certifications|Platinum-certified]] album ''[[Lick It Up]]'' successfully introducing them to a new generation of fans, and its music videos receiving regular airplay on [[MTV]]. [[Eric Carr]], who had replaced Criss in 1980, died in 1991 of [[heart cancer]] and was replaced by [[Eric Singer]]. In response to a wave of Kiss [[nostalgia]] in the mid-1990s, the original lineup re-united in 1996, which also saw the return of its makeup and stage costumes. The resulting reunion tour was highly successful, grossing $143.7&nbsp;million, making it the band's most successful tour to date. Criss and Frehley subsequently left the band again, and have been replaced by Singer and [[Tommy Thayer]]. The band has continued with its original stage makeup, with Singer and Thayer using the original Catman and Spaceman makeup, respectively. In September 2018, Kiss announced that, after 45 years of recording and performing, it would be embarking on its ongoing final tour, the [[End of the Road World Tour]], which started in January 2019 and is currently set to conclude in 2022.<ref name="farewell tour 2019">{{cite news |title=It's Official: KISS To Launch Farewell Tour, 'End Of The Road', In 2019 |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/its-official-kiss-to-launch-farewell-tour-end-of-the-road-in-january/ |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=September 20, 2018 |date=September 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/gene-simmons-says-kisss-end-of-the-road-tour-could-last-more-than-three-years/ |title=GENE SIMMONS Says KISS's 'End Of The Road' Tour Could Last More Than Three Years |publisher=Blabbermouth |date=November 12, 2018 |access-date=July 12, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-to-launch-three-year-world-tour-in-january-2019-says-gene-simmons/ |title=KISS To Launch Three Year Tour In January 2019, Says GENE SIMMONS |publisher=Blabbermouth |date=June 4, 2018|access-date=August 14, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-2020-tour-dates/ |title=Kiss Reveal 75 New 2020 'End of the Road' Tour Dates |last=Kielty |first=Martin |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=2019-11-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/paul-stanley-on-why-end-of-the-road-is-kisss-final-tour-its-just-not-possible-to-continue-doing-this-the-way-we-do-it/|title=PAUL STANLEY On Why 'End Of The Road' Is KISS's Final Tour: 'It's Just Not Possible To Continue Doing This The Way We Do It'|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 5, 2020|access-date=January 5, 2020}}</ref>

==History==

===1971–1975: Early years===
Kiss traces its roots to [[Wicked Lester]], a New York City-based rock band led by [[Gene Simmons]] and [[Paul Stanley]]. That band recorded one album, which was shelved by [[Epic Records]], and played a handful of live shows. Simmons and Stanley, feeling a new musical direction was needed, abandoned Wicked Lester in 1972 and began forming a new group.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 14.</ref><ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 68–71.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 20–21.</ref>

After breaking up Wicked Lester late in 1972, Simmons and Stanley came across an ad in the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] version of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' placed by [[Peter Criss]], a drummer from the New York City scene who had previously played in the bands Lips and [[Chelsea (American band)|Chelsea]]. Simmons and Stanley met Criss in a nightclub where he was playing drums. After hearing Criss sing, they thought Criss should be in the new band they were forming. Criss then auditioned for, and later joined their new band. The three focused on a much harder style of rock than that played by Wicked Lester. In November 1972, the band played a showcase for Epic Records [[A&R]] director Don Ellis, in an effort to secure a record deal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gill |first1=Julian |title=Kiss On Tour |publisher=KISSFAQ |isbn=978-1-7344412-1-5 |page=6 |edition=2020}}</ref> In early January 1973, the group added lead guitarist [[Ace Frehley]]. Frehley impressed the group with his first audition, and was asked back for a second audition. A few weeks after Frehley joined, the classic lineup was solidified as the band to be named Kiss.<ref name="acebio">{{cite web |url=http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57|title=Artist bio: Ace Frehley |publisher=Kayos Productions |access-date=January 6, 2010|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080049/http://www.kayosproductions.com/artists.php?id=57 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref> They also began experimenting with their image, by wearing makeup and various outfits.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 33, 57–58.</ref>

[[File:Kiss Logo.svg|thumb|upright|The Kiss logo]]

Stanley came up with the name while he, Simmons, and Criss were driving around New York City. Criss mentioned that he had been in a band called Lips, so Stanley said something to the effect of "What about Kiss?"<ref>{{cite video |people=[[Gene Simmons]] |date=1987 |title=[[Exposed (Kiss)|Exposed]] |type=VHS |publisher=[[Mercury Records|Mercury]]}}</ref> Frehley created the now-iconic logo, making the "SS" look like lightning bolts, when he went to write the new band name over "Wicked Lester" on a poster outside the club where they were going to play.<ref>Gebert and McAdams, ''Kiss & Tell,'' pp. 41, 42.</ref> (Some of Wicked Lester's artwork included one lightning bolt for the "S" in Lester.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2013/06/iconic-logos |title=Iconic New York Music Logos Explained – KISS |date=April 29, 2013 |work=Red Bull Music Academy |last=Apfelbaum |first=Sue |page=12 |access-date=June 16, 2017}} Article also hosted by Sue Apfelbaum [https://s3.amazonaws.com/external_clips/278919/Kiss_logo.pdf here.]</ref>) Later, Stanley designed the logo with a [[Sharpie (marker)|Sharpie]] and a ruler and accidentally drew the two S's nonparallel because he did it "by eye". The art department asked him if he wanted it to be redrafted to be perfect and he said, "It got us this far, let's leave well enough alone. Our number one rule has always been no rules."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Van Luling|first1=Todd|title=Paul Stanley Shares Stories You Didn't Know About KISS|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kiss-logo-paul-stanley_us_5746f074e4b03ede4413e8f5|website=The Huffington Post|date=26 May 2016|access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

[[File:KISS alternate logo.svg|thumb|upright|Modified KISS logo used in Germany, Austria, Israel, and other countries that outlaw Nazi symbols.]]

The letters happened to look similar to the insignia of the [[Nazi Party|Nazi]] [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], a symbol that is outlawed in Germany by [[Strafgesetzbuch section 86a|Section 86a]] of the German criminal code. However, Simmons and Stanley, both Jewish, have denied any intentional likeness to Nazi symbolism in the logo. Since 1979, most of the band's album covers and merchandise in Germany have used a different logo, in which the letters "SS" look like the letters "ZZ" backwards. This logo is also used in [[Austria]], [[Switzerland]], [[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]] and [[Israel]] to avoid controversy.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/kiss-nazi-logo_n_577430ade4b0bd4b0b13779c|title=Ace Frehley Addresses Theory About The Famous KISS Logo|last=Van Luling|first=Todd|date=July 8, 2016|work=HuffPost|access-date=January 27, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=May 18, 2020|first=Matthew|last=Wilkening|title=How Nazi Comparisons Forced Kiss to Change Their Logo in Germany|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-german-logo/|access-date=January 27, 2021|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en}}</ref>

The band's name has repeatedly been the subject of rumors pertaining to alleged hidden meanings. Among these rumors are theories that the name is an acronym for "Knights in Satan's Service", "Kinder SS", or "Kids in Satan's Service". Simmons has denied all of these claims.<ref name="simmons">Simmons, Gene (2001). ''Kiss and Make-up''. Crown. {{ISBN|0-609-60855-X}}. p. 119</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mikkelson |first1=David |title=KISS: Does It Stand for 'Knights in Satan's Service'? |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kiss/ |website=Snopes.com |publisher=Snopes |access-date=6 October 2020 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20201006011423/https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/kiss/ |archive-date=6 October 2020 |date=21 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The first Kiss performance took place on January 30, 1973, for an audience of fewer than ten people at the Popcorn Club (renamed Coventry shortly afterward) in [[Queens]]. The band was paid $50 for performing two sets that evening, following a cold-call Simmons had made to the venue, convincing them to hire the new band for a three-night stand.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-first-concert/|title=The Day Kiss Played Their First Show|work=Ultimate Classic Rock|date=January 30, 2016|access-date=August 22, 2020|author=Wilkening, Matthew}}</ref> For the first three gigs, January 30 to February 1, they wore makeup, but the iconic character designs associated with Kiss made their debuts during the March 9–10 shows at The Daisy in [[Amityville, New York]].

{{quote|Our first show ever was at Coventry. Coventry was a study in contrasts. The first time we played there was nobody there. The last time we played there, you could barely get in the door.<br>—Paul Stanley<ref>(2019). End of the Road World Tour Program, p. 4.</ref>}}

On March 13 of that year, the band recorded a five-song demo tape with producer [[Eddie Kramer]]. Former TV director [[Bill Aucoin]], who had seen the group at a handful of showcase concerts in the summer of 1973, offered to become the band's manager in mid-October. Kiss agreed, with the condition that Aucoin signs the band to a record label within two weeks. On November 1, 1973, Kiss became the first act signed to former teen pop singer and [[Buddah Records]] executive [[Neil Bogart]]'s new label, [[Casablanca Records]].<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 145–146.</ref>

The band entered Bell Sound Studios in New York City on October 10, 1973, to begin recording its first album. On December 31, the band had its official industry premiere at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|Academy of Music]] in New York City, opening for [[Blue Öyster Cult]]. It was at this concert that, for the first of many times, Simmons accidentally set his hair (which was coated in hairspray) ablaze while performing his fire-breathing routine.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 27.</ref>

Kiss's first tour started on February 5, 1974, in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], at the [[Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium]], as an opening act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kissonline.com/history |title=Kiss Chronology |work=kissonline.com |access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> The band's [[Kiss (Kiss album)|self-titled debut album]] was released on February 18. Casablanca and Kiss promoted the album heavily throughout the spring and summer of 1974.

{{quote|"Being in Kiss in the very first year and touring around the United States, we felt like we were taking off. It was like somebody pushing you into the deep end of the pool whether you can swim or not. The early years of Kiss were far from glamorous. We rode in a station wagon hundreds of miles every day. We would take turns driving and sleeping in the back. We ate burgers at roadside taverns. We stopped and peed on the side of long stretches of a highway when we couldn't find a town anywhere near. We ate beans and franks because we couldn't afford better food as we were on an $85 a week salary! Becoming a rock star was better than anything and beyond anything I ever imagined. There were moments of doubt for me that we were gonna make it."<br>—Gene Simmons<ref>(2019). End of the Road World Tour Program, p. 5.</ref>}}

On February 19, in its first television appearance, the band performed "[[Nothin' to Lose (Kiss song)|Nothin' to Lose]]", "[[Firehouse (Kiss song)|Firehouse]]" and "[[Black Diamond (Kiss song)|Black Diamond]]" on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[In Concert (American TV series)|In Concert]]'' (aired March 29).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Kielty |first1=Martin |title=When Kiss Made Their National TV Debut |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-national-tv-debut/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=April 27, 2021 |language=en |date=March 29, 2021}}</ref> On April 29, the band performed "Firehouse" on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. This broadcast included Simmons's first televised interview, a conversation with [[Mike Douglas]] in which Simmons declared himself "evil incarnate", eliciting uncomfortable reactions from a confused studio audience. Fellow Jewish-American guest [[Totie Fields]] said it would be humorous if beneath all the make-up Simmons was "just a [[nice Jewish boy]]". Simmons responded, "You should only know", to which Fields replied, "I do. You can't hide the [[Hook nose|hook]]", a reference to the [[Jewish nose|stereotypical "Jewish" nose]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Greene |first1=Andy |title=Flashback: Kiss Perform 'Firehouse' on 'The Mike Douglas Show' in 1974 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kiss-biopic-firehouse-live-1974-1159821/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 27, 2021 |date=April 22, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite video |date=October 31, 2006 |title=Kissology Volume One: 1974–1977 |type=DVD |publisher=[[VH1 Classic]]}}</ref>

Despite the publicity and constant touring, ''Kiss'' initially sold just 75,000 copies. Meanwhile, the group and Casablanca Records were losing money quickly. The band (while touring) stopped in Los Angeles in August 1974 to begin recording its second album, ''[[Hotter than Hell (album)|Hotter Than Hell]]'', which was released on October 22, 1974. The only single, "[[Let Me Go, Rock 'n' Roll]]", failed to chart, and the album stalled at No. 100.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 140–141.</ref>

With ''Hotter Than Hell'' quickly dropping off the charts, Kiss was pulled from its tour to quickly record a new album. Casablanca head Bogart stepped in to produce the next album, trading in the murky, distorted sound of ''Hotter Than Hell'' for a cleaner and slightly poppier sound. ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]'', released on March 19, 1975, fared slightly better commercially than ''Hotter Than Hell''. It also contained what later became the band's signature song, "[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]".<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r11054/review|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review ''Dressed to Kill'' |last=Prato |first=Greg |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=January 6, 2010}}</ref>

Although Kiss albums had not proved to be big sellers, the band was quickly gaining a reputation for its live performances. Kiss concerts featured such spectacles as Simmons spitting "blood" (an effect made primarily from eggs, yogurt, red food coloring, and maple syrup) and "breathing fire" (spitting flammable liquid at a torch), Frehley soloing as his guitar burst into flames (light and smoke bombs placed inside the guitar), Criss's elevating drum riser that emitted sparks, Stanley's [[Pete Townshend|Townshend]]-style guitar smashing, and pyrotechnics throughout the show.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1996/08/16/tour-kiss/|title=On tour with KISS|website=EW.com|access-date=July 19, 2021}}</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 62–64.</ref>

By mid-1975, Casablanca was almost bankrupt, and Kiss was in danger of losing its record contract. Both parties desperately needed a commercial breakthrough if they were to survive.<ref>{{cite web |last=Young |first=Charles |title=Kiss: The Pagan Beasties of Teenage Rock |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-the-pagan-beasties-of-teenage-rock-20120427?print=true |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=August 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ADLdpiPk?url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/kiss-the-pagan-beasties-of-teenage-rock-20120427?print=true |archive-date=August 26, 2012 |date=April 7, 1977 |url-status=live }}</ref> That breakthrough came in an unlikely form: a "double live" album.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r11053|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review ''Alive!'' |last=Prato |first=Greg |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=January 6, 2010}}</ref>

===1975–1978: Rise to prominence===
[[Image:Kiss - Paul Stanley - Destroyer Tour.jpg|thumb|left|Stanley performing with Kiss in [[Winnipeg]] on the [[Alive! Tour]] in 1976]]
{{quote|"I saw a pattern emerging with us on the road. Every night, I'd ask somebody before the show, 'How are we doing?', which meant, 'What's the attendance?' One night they said, 'It's sold out,' and then the next night I'd hear the same thing. All of a sudden it was becoming the norm. For me the first realization that things were on an upswing was when we played the Hara Arena in Dayton, Ohio. Before the show I went on stage, looked out through the curtain and saw this big crowd, and said to myself, 'My God, this is really happening!'"<br>—Paul Stanley<ref>(2019). End of the Road World Tour Program, p. 8.</ref>}}

Kiss wanted to express the excitement felt at its concerts (which its studio albums had so far failed to do) with its first live album. Compiled from concerts recorded between May and July in [[Wildwood, New Jersey]], [[Detroit]] and [[Cleveland]], and released on September 10, 1975, ''[[Alive! (Kiss album)|Alive!]]'' achieved [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] status and spawned Kiss's first top 40 single: a live version of "Rock and Roll All Nite". It was the first version of the song with a guitar solo, and this recording has become the best-known version. It is also the basis of most covers, such as the cover by [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] in 1987. In recent years the band admitted that additional audience noise had been added to the album, as well as overdubs on select guitar and vocal spots, not to deceive fans, but to add more "excitement and realism" to the record.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 169–172.</ref>

The success of ''Alive!'' not only brought Kiss the breakthrough they had been seeking but arguably saved Casablanca, which was close to bankruptcy. Following this success, Kiss partnered with producer [[Bob Ezrin]], who had previously worked with [[Alice Cooper]]. The result was ''[[Destroyer (Kiss album)|Destroyer]]'' (released March 15, 1976), Kiss's most musically ambitious studio album to date. ''Destroyer'', with its rather intricate production (using an orchestra, choir, and numerous tape effects), was a departure from the raw sound of the first three studio albums. Album art was designed by [[Ken Kelly (artist)|Ken Kelly]], who had drawn [[Tarzan]] and [[Conan the Barbarian]] and also produced album covers for acts such as [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] and [[Manowar]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Voger |title=Criss eager to meet television idol Zacherley |work=[[Asbury Park Press]] |page=6E |date=October 22, 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Manowar truck to make its debut in Austria this weekend |work=Austria Today |date=September 8, 2006}}</ref> While the album sold well initially and became the group's second Gold album, it quickly dropped down the charts. Only when the ballad "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]", the [[B-side]] of the single "[[Detroit Rock City]]", began to gain more airplay on FM radio did the album's sales rebound. The single was subsequently reissued with the A- and B-sides reversed. "Beth" peaked at No. 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

[[File: Kiss in New Haven 1978.jpg|thumb|upright|Simmons and Frehley share a microphone in 1978.]]
In October 1976, Kiss appeared on ''[[The Paul Lynde Halloween Special]]'' (aired on ABC the 29th), [[lip-sync]]hing "[[Detroit Rock City]]", "[[Beth (song)|Beth]]" and "[[King of the Night Time World]]". The show, co-produced by Bill Aucoin, helped introduce Kiss to an even wider audience. In addition to the three songs, Kiss was the subject of a brief comedic "interview" conducted by [[Paul Lynde]]. This included Lynde noting, when hearing the member's first names, "Oh, I love a good religious group."

Two more highly successful studio albums were released in less than a year: ''[[Rock and Roll Over]]'' (November 11, 1976) and ''[[Love Gun]]'' (June 30, 1977). A second live album, ''[[Alive II]]'', was released on October 14, 1977. All three albums were certified Platinum soon after their release. Between 1976 and 1978, Kiss earned $17.7 million from record royalties and music publishing.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 65–66.</ref> A 1977 [[Gallup poll]] named Kiss the most popular band in America. In Japan, Kiss performed five sold-out shows at Tokyo's [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan Hall]], breaking the previous record of four set by [[the Beatles]].

{{quote|"When we played in Japan in the late '70s, nothing could prepare you for the hysteria because when people are telling you how big you are, you're big compared to what? Until you're faced with mass hysteria it doesn't really sink in. For you not having been in a certain country makes them that much more rabid for you to go."<br>—Paul Stanley<ref>(2019).

In May 1977, Kiss made the first of its many [[comic books|comics]] appearances, in ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' issue 12, published by [[Marvel Comics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worthpoint.com/worthopedia/howard-the-duck-1-32-+-extras-first-kiss-in |title=Howard the Duck 1-32 + Extras - First KISS in Comics |language=ja |publisher=Worthpoint.com |date=July 14, 2010 |access-date=July 28, 2010}}</ref>

The first Kiss compilation album, ''[[Double Platinum (Kiss album)|Double Platinum]]'', was issued on April 2, 1978. This double album included many remixed versions of the band's hits, as well as "Strutter '78", a re-recorded version of a song from the group's first album. At Bogart's request, this version of the song featured a [[disco]] influence.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 272–273.</ref>

During this period, [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss merchandise]] became a substantial source of income for the group. Some of the products released included a pair of comic books issued by Marvel (the first contained ink mixed with actual blood donated by the group), a [[pinball]] machine, dolls, "Kiss Your Face Makeup" kits, [[Halloween]] masks, [[board game]]s, lunch boxes, trading cards and many other pieces of memorabilia. Membership in the [[Kiss Army]], the band's fan club, was in the six figures. Between 1977 and 1979, worldwide merchandise sales (in-store and on tour) reached an estimated $100 million.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 162.</ref>

''Alive II'' was the band's fourth Platinum album in just under two years, and the ensuing tour had the highest average attendance in the group's history. In addition, Kiss's gross income for 1977 was $10.2&nbsp; million. The group, along with manager Aucoin, sought to push the brand harder. To that end, an ambitious, two-pronged strategy was devised for 1978.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 88–89.</ref>

The first part involved the simultaneous release of four solo albums from the members of Kiss. Although Kiss has claimed that the solo albums were intended to ease rising tensions within the band, its 1976 record contract did in fact call for four solo records, each of them counting as half an album toward the group's five-record commitment.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 271.</ref> Each album was a solo effort (none of the group appeared on another's album) and was all released and marketed as Kiss albums (with similar cover art and poster inserts). It was the first time that all current members of a rock band had released solo albums on the same day.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 92.</ref>

For the band members, it was a chance to showcase their individual musical styles and tastes outside of Kiss, and in some cases to collaborate with contemporary artists. Stanley's and Frehley's albums were most similar to Kiss's hard rock style, while Criss's album featured an [[R&B]] style with multiple ballads. Simmons's was the most diverse of the four, featuring hard rock, ballads, [[Beatles]]-influenced pop and a [[cover version]] of "[[When You Wish Upon a Star]]" from the Disney film ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''. Simmons' many collaborators included [[Aerosmith]]'s [[Joe Perry (musician)|Joe Perry]], [[Cheap Trick]]'s [[Rick Nielsen]], [[the Doobie Brothers]]' [[Jeff "Skunk" Baxter]], [[Donna Summer]], [[Janis Ian]], [[Helen Reddy]], [[Bob Seger]], [[Katey Sagal]] and his then-girlfriend [[Cher]].

The solo albums were released on September 18, 1978. Casablanca spent $2.5&nbsp; million on the marketing campaign for the albums, and announced they were shipping five million copies, guaranteeing Platinum status.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 94.</ref> Despite the large shipments, none of the albums sold particularly well and were later sold as [[Cut-out (recording industry)|cut-outs]]. Of the four, Simmons's album charted the highest in the U.S., peaking at #22, while Frehley's spawned the only resulting Top Forty hit single, a cover of "[[New York Groove]]", written by [[Russ Ballard]] and originally performed by [[Hello (band)|Hello]].<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 95.</ref>

The second part of Kiss's and Aucoin's plan called for the band to appear in a film that would cement its image of larger-than-life rock-and-roll superheroes. Filming commenced in the spring of 1978. Although the project was proposed to the band as a cross between ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', the final result fell far short of those expectations. The final product, ''[[Kiss Meets the Phantom of the Park]]'', debuted on [[NBC]] on October 28, 1978. It was released theatrically, after many changes, outside the U.S. in 1979 under the title ''Attack of the Phantoms''. The band members were unhappy with the finished film and would speak about their filmmaking experience in later interviews with a mix of humorous embarrassment and regret. They felt that the film portrayed them more as clowns than superheroes. The artistic failure of the film led to a rift between the band and Aucoin.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 91–92.</ref>

===1979–1983: Final make-up years===
Kiss's first album of new material in two years, ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'' (1979), continued the band's Platinum streak. The disco-flavored "[[I Was Made for Lovin' You]]" became one of the band's biggest hit singles to date, peaking at No. 11. Session drummer [[Anton Fig]] performed almost all the percussion on the album while Criss recovered from an automobile accident. The only song to feature Criss's drumming was "Dirty Livin{{'"}}, on which he also sang lead.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 346–347.</ref>

Billed as "The Return of Kiss", the [[Dynasty Tour]] was expected by Kiss and its management to build on the success of previous tours. Plans were drawn up for a Kiss-themed traveling [[amusement park]] called "Kiss World", but were abandoned because of the immense costs involved;<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 102–105.</ref> however, "The Return of Kiss" saw a marked decline in attendance.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 98.</ref>

[[File:KISS Gene Simmons 1979.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Simmons performing with Kiss in 1979]]
The crowds on this tour were much younger than previous audiences had been, with many preadolescent children in Kiss make-up with their mothers and fathers (who were sometimes wearing the make-up themselves) in tow at most concerts. Kiss themselves did little to dissuade this new fan base, donning colorful costumes that reinforced a cartoonish image for these younger fans.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 100.</ref>

The fans were unaware of the dissension within the band. One very public indication of the heightened friction within the group was an infamous October 31, 1979 interview on [[Tom Snyder]]'s late-night ''[[The Tomorrow Show]]''. During the episode, a visibly irritated Simmons and Stanley attempted, unsuccessfully, to contain the [[Alcohol intoxication|inebriated]] Frehley, whose frequent laughter and joking overshadowed the conversation between Snyder and the rest of the band. Criss made references to his large gun collection, to the chagrin of Simmons.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 170–171.</ref>

By the end of the ''Dynasty'' tour in December 1979, tensions between Criss and the rest of the band were at an all-time high. His drumming skills had noticeably eroded, and he even intentionally slowed down—or stopped playing altogether—during some concerts. The final show of the tour (December 16, 1979) was the last time Criss performed with the group for almost 17 years, although he remained an official member for nearly six more months.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 97–98.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 150–151.</ref>

Anton Fig played all the drums on the next album, ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'', although he was not credited, while Criss appeared on the cover. Showcasing a slick, contemporary pop sound, ''Unmasked'' (released May 20, 1980) had the dubious distinction of being the first non-Platinum Kiss album since ''[[Dressed to Kill (album)|Dressed to Kill]]''. Soon after the album's release, Criss's departure was officially announced.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 109.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 101–102.</ref> Anton Fig, considered a member of Kiss for one day following the departure of Criss, was then fired by Stanley and Simmons, who felt he was not a good fit for the band.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bnMF7j2nP4 |title=KISS Legend Ace Frehley - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? (Part 2) |website=Youtube.com}}</ref>

The band auditioned dozens of replacements for Criss in June 1980. One of the many who auditioned was [[Tico Torres]] (who would later be with [[Bon Jovi]]). They finally settled on a little-known drummer-guitarist-pianist-keyboardist-singer from Brooklyn named Paul Charles Caravello (born July 12, 1950) who adopted the stage name [[Eric Carr]]. His first make-up design was modeled on a hawk, though it was rejected as Stanley felt it looked more like a chicken. Carr ultimately settled on a "Fox" persona. In his Fox make-up, he was introduced on ABC's ''[[Kids Are People Too!]]'', and debuted with the group on July 25, 1980, at the [[Palladium (club)|Palladium]] concert hall in New York City. This was Kiss's only U.S. show in support of ''Unmasked''. The band's [[Unmasked Tour|1980 tour]] of Australia and New Zealand, on the other hand, was one of the biggest in its history, as they played to sold-out crowds and received overwhelmingly positive press coverage.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 113.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 102.</ref>

For its next album, the band worked again with producer Ezrin, with whom Kiss had found success on ''Destroyer''. Early press reports indicated that the new album would be a return to the hard rock style that had originally brought the band success. However, 1981's ''[[Music from "The Elder"]]'' was a [[concept album]] featuring medieval horns, strings, [[harp]]s, and synthesizers.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 460.</ref>

The album was presented as a soundtrack to a film that was never made, making it difficult to follow the storyline. To make matters worse, having received negative feedback following its record company's preview of the album, Kiss altered the record's track sequence in most countries to emphasize potential singles "The Oath" and "A World Without Heroes", which all but guaranteed the inability of listeners to understand the already-muddled storyline. Once released, fan reaction to ''The Elder'' was harsh; it failed to achieve Gold status and peaked at No. 75 on the ''Billboard'' album chart.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 462–463.</ref>

The band made only two appearances in support of the new album, both in January 1982. One was a performance on the ABC late-night variety program ''[[Fridays (TV series)|Fridays]]'', while the second was a lip-synced performance that was broadcast via satellite during Italy's [[Sanremo Music Festival]].<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 117.</ref>

Absent from the satellite performance was Frehley, who had become increasingly frustrated with Kiss's new musical direction. Upset with the band's decision to record ''Music from "The Elder"'', he did not actively participate in the album's creation, providing lead vocals for only one track, "Dark Light". He did not appear at a special concert at [[Studio 54]] in New York City, leaving Kiss to perform as a trio. He recorded his guitar parts at his home studio in [[Wilton, Connecticut]], and mailed them to Ezrin. Another source of frustration for Frehley was that with the departure of Criss, and with Carr not being an equal partner in the band, he was often outvoted 2-to-1 on group decisions. In June 1982, Frehley's departure from the band was negotiated, although he did not officially leave until December.

Simmons stated in his autobiography ''[[Kiss and Make-Up]]'' that [[Van Halen]] founder [[Eddie Van Halen]] was eager to replace Frehley as Kiss's lead guitarist. Simmons and Eddie's brother [[Alex Van Halen|Alex]] convinced Eddie to remain with Van Halen.<ref>Simmons, ''Kiss and Make-up'', p. 186.</ref> Eddie was willing to break up Van Halen due to tensions between himself and lead vocalist [[David Lee Roth]], who ultimately left the band in 1985.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', p. 514.</ref><ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 243–244.</ref> Other notable guitarists who auditioned to replace Frehley included [[Punky Meadows]] of [[Angel (American band)|Angel]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|url=http://www.alternativenation.net/guitarist-turned-kiss-aerosmith-new-york-dolls/|title=The Guitarist Who Turned Down KISS, Aerosmith & New York Dolls|work=alternativenation.net|date=2 March 2017|access-date=March 2, 2017}}</ref> [[Doug Aldrich]] of [[Whitesnake]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Nikas |first1=Sakis |last2=Dolas |first2=Yannis |url=http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=7391&type=1&lang=EN |title=Interviews - Doug Aldrich |work=rockpages.gr |access-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426105402/http://www.rockpages.gr/detailspage.aspx?id=7391&type=1&lang=EN |archive-date=April 26, 2012 }}</ref> [[Richie Sambora]] of [[Bon Jovi]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitar.com/articles/richie-sambora-kiss-reject-pop-rock-hero|title=Richie Sambora - Kiss Reject, Pop Rock Hero|work=guitar.com|access-date=April 25, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521101015/http://www.guitar.com/articles/richie-sambora-kiss-reject-pop-rock-hero|archive-date=May 21, 2011}}</ref> and [[Yngwie Malmsteen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Ochoa |first=Hugh |url=http://guitarinternational.com/2010/06/24/malmsteen/ |title=Yngwie Malmsteen Interview: Strats, Shreds and Sweeps |work=guitarinternational.com |access-date=April 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110402002803/http://guitarinternational.com/2010/06/24/malmsteen/ |archive-date=April 2, 2011 }}</ref>

Soon afterward, Kiss made major changes to its business dealings&nbsp;– chief among them was severing ties with its manager of nine years, Bill Aucoin, and cutting back on its unwieldy organizational tree. Although Frehley had already decided to leave the band, he was pictured on the covers of 1982's ''[[Killers (Kiss album)|Killers]]'' and ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'', although he did not participate in the recording of either album.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 255–256.</ref>

''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' (October 13, 1982) was Kiss's heaviest album to date, and although it fared better than ''[[Music from "The Elder"]]'', it peaked at only No. 45 on the charts and was not certified Gold until 1994. In Frehley's absence, Kiss utilized a number of guitarists for the recording of the album, including [[Vinnie Vincent]].

Frehley's last appearance with the band (until the 1996 reunion) was in the music video for the single "[[I Love It Loud]]", which was co-written by Vincent. Frehley also appeared on the cover of the original ''Creatures of the Night'' album artwork. When the album was remixed and re-released in 1985 with a non-makeup cover and a slightly different song order, to reflect the band's roster change and abandonment of its make-up and costumes, Vincent was again absent from the album cover, as then-current lead guitarist, [[Bruce Kulick]], appeared instead.<ref name="Music Legends">{{cite web |publisher=Music Legends |url=http://musiclegends.ca/interviews/bruce-kulick-interview/ |title=Bruce Kulick Interview |access-date=May 8, 2013 |date=March 14, 2011 |last=Saulnier |first=Jason}}</ref> The liner notes accompanying the remixed LP, however, credited both Frehley and Vincent with lead guitar performances on the ''[[Creatures of the Night]]'' album. Vincent officially replaced Frehley as lead guitarist in December 1982, as the band embarked on its 10th Anniversary Tour.<ref>Gill, ''Focus'', pp. 493–495.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 118–120.</ref>

Vincent originally wanted to use his birth name in the band, but this was vetoed by Simmons on the grounds that it sounded "too ethnic". Specifically, according to Simmons, "it sounded like a fruit vendor". Simmons went on to note that "fairly or unfairly, rock and roll is about the image".<ref name="Simmons, p. 187">Simmons, ''Kiss and Make-up'', p. 187.</ref> Vincent then suggested the name "Mick Fury", but this was also disallowed. Simmons later suggested the name change to "Vinnie Vincent". Vincent started actively pushing to join Kiss as a full member. Despite the misgivings that both Simmons and Stanley harbored about his personality, Vincent was taken into the band. Stanley designed a character, "the Wiz"<ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 187">Simmons, Gene (2001). KISS AND MAKE-UP.

A persona as "the Ankh Warrior" or similar is not mentioned in the book at all.<ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 187"/><ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 192"/>

From 1982 to 1983, the new lineup of Kiss became Simmons (the Demon), Stanley (the Starchild), [[Eric Carr]] (the Fox) and Vincent (the Egyptian Warrior).<ref name="Leaf 2003 103"/> or the Wiz<ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 187"/><ref name="Simmons, Gene 2001 Page 192"/>

Vincent's personality did not mesh well with either Stanley or Simmons, and he was dismissed from Kiss at the end of the ''Creatures'' tour. He was quickly reinstated before recording started for ''[[Lick It Up]]'' because Simmons and Stanley could not find a new lead guitarist on such short notice. Vincent appeared on the cover of ''Lick It Up'' and was credited as the lead guitarist. He received a writing credit for eight of the ten songs on the album.

Personality issues arose once again, and Vincent was fired following the ''Lick It Up'' tour, due in part to excessive guitar soloing at a 1984 concert in Quebec. He was replaced by [[Mark St. John]]. Vincent was later utilized by Kiss as a songwriter on the 1992 album ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'', contributing to the songs "[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]", "Tough Love", "Heart of Chrome" and "[[I Just Wanna (Kiss song)|I Just Wanna]]". Vincent and the band parted ways. Persistent rumors circulated for years among Kiss fans regarding the true reason for Vincent's dismissals from Kiss, with at least one band member refusing to comment except to say that legally it was not up for discussion. Simmons stated in an interview several years later that Vincent's firing was for "unethical behavior", but he did not elaborate:
{{quote|Vinnie, for the record, was fired for unethical behavior, not because of lack of talent.<ref>{{cite web |author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/GeneSimmonsInterview.html |title=Interview With Gene Simmons |publisher=Classicbands.com |access-date=August 22, 2011}}</ref>}}

===1983–1996: Unmasking===
Sensing it was time for a change, Kiss made the decision to abandon its trademark make-up and costumes. The band officially appeared in public without make-up for the first time since its very early days on a September 18, 1983, appearance on MTV, which coincided with the release of ''[[Lick It Up]]''.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 289.</ref> The tour to promote the new album and the unmasked band members began in Lisbon, Portugal, on October 11, 1983, at Pavilhão Dramático de Cascais, the band's first concert without make-up since early 1973. ''Lick It Up'' became Kiss's first Gold record in three years, but the tour was even more sparsely attended than the previous one. Vincent did not get along with Simmons and Stanley, and he left the band at the conclusion of the tour in March 1984. Vincent's replacement was [[Mark St. John]], a session player and guitar tutor.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', p. 294.</ref>

With St. John, Kiss released the album ''[[Animalize]]'' on September 13, 1984. ''Animalize'' followed the success of ''Lick It Up'', and due in part to consistent MTV play for the "[[Heaven's on Fire]]" video, ''Animalize'' was the band's best-selling record in America during the decade, with over two million albums sold. With the success of the album and subsequent tour, Kiss had recaptured some of its earlier glory (though not to the level of its 1970s heyday). St. John, however, came down with [[reactive arthritis]] during tour rehearsals, and only performed at a handful of shows before being dismissed from the band in December 1984. The band hired [[Bruce Kulick]] to replace St. John. Kulick had previously filled in for St. John during the first two months of the ''Animalize'' tour. Kulick was Kiss's fourth lead guitarist in less than three years, but he stayed with the band for 12 years.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', pp. 139–140.</ref> Kulick was one of the band's longest-serving members, with the longest continuous tenure of anyone other than Simmons and Stanley.

{{quote|"You can't help but have a good time at one of our shows when everybody is going nuts onstage. That kind of good time is infectious. You can't fake it. You can't fool the audience. The people will see right through you if you put on a fake smile or you're not putting out your best. The band are alive and well and playing better than we ever have."<br>—Gene Simmons<ref>(2019). End of the Road World Tour Program, pg. 21.</ref>}}

[[File:BruceKulickGFR2002.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Bruce Kulick]] (pictured here in 2002) was the lead guitarist for Kiss from 1984 to 1996.]]
One of the first concerts Kulick played as an official member of the band was at Detroit, Michigan's [[Cobo Hall]]. It was filmed for the MTV special ''[[Animalize Live]]''.

The lineup of Stanley, Simmons, Carr and Kulick turned out to be the most stable since the original, and for the rest of the 1980s, Kiss released a series of Platinum albums: 1985's ''[[Asylum (Kiss album)|Asylum]]'', 1987's ''[[Crazy Nights]]'' and the 1988 greatest hits compilation ''[[Smashes, Thrashes & Hits]]''. ''Crazy Nights'', in particular, was one of Kiss's most successful albums overseas. The single "[[Crazy Crazy Nights]]" reached No. 4 on the singles chart in the United Kingdom, the band's highest-charting single in that country.<ref name="charts">{{cite web |url=http://www.kissfaq.com/charts/scharts.html |title=Singles Chart Action |work=The Kiss FAQ |access-date=July 30, 2006}}</ref>

Kiss ended the decade with the October 1989 release ''[[Hot in the Shade]]''. Although the album failed to achieve Platinum status, it spawned the hit ballad "[[Forever (Kiss song)|Forever]]", co-written by [[Michael Bolton]]. Peaking at No. 8 in the US, it was the group's highest-charting single since "Beth" and was the band's second Top 10 single.<ref name="charts"/>

During this time, Kiss struggled with its identity and fan base. Simmons, arguably the driving force in Kiss during the 1970s, became less involved with the group in the 1980s as he pursued outside interests, most notably a film career. Stanley took a more prominent role as a result.<ref>Lendt, ''Kiss and Sell'', pp. 311–312.</ref><ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 360–363.</ref>

In February 1991, the band decided to once again enlist Ezrin to produce its next album. Before recording could begin in earnest, however, tragedy struck. In March 1991, it was discovered that Carr had a [[tumor]] on his heart. It was successfully removed the following month, but more tumors were soon discovered in his lungs. Carr received [[chemotherapy]] and was pronounced cancer-free in July. However, in September he suffered the first of two [[cerebral hemorrhage]]s. He died on November 24, 1991, at the age of 41.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 107.</ref><ref name="carrobit">{{cite web |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1DE123DF935A15752C1A967958260 |title=Eric Carr, 41, Is Dead; Rock Band's Drummer |date=November 26, 1991 |work=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=April 16, 2006}}</ref>

Despite the tragic loss of a longtime member, Kiss continued, introducing veteran drummer [[Eric Singer]] (born Eric Doyle Mensinger on May 12, 1958, in Cleveland, Ohio). Singer had played with Paul Stanley previously, as part of Stanley's backing band during a 1989 solo tour.

Kiss released ''[[Revenge (Kiss album)|Revenge]]'' on May 19, 1992. It featured a leaner, harder-edged sound, as indicated by the first single, "[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]". In a surprise move, Kiss enlisted Vincent to help with songwriting duties. The album debuted in the Top 10 and went Gold. Kiss embarked on a brief club tour of the U.S. in the spring of 1992, before beginning an American tour in September 1992. The tour was documented on the album ''[[Alive III]]'', released on May 14, 1993. Four days later, Kiss were inducted into [[Guitar Center#Hollywood.27s RockWalk|Hollywood's RockWalk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockwalk.com/inductees |title=Guitar Center's Hollywood Rockwalk |publisher=Rockwalk.com |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

In 1995, the group released the book ''[[Bibliography of Kiss#Kisstory|Kisstory]]'', a 440-page, {{convert|9|lb|kg}}, detailed chronicle of the group's history to that point. That same year, the band embarked on a unique and well-received Worldwide Kiss Convention Tour. The conventions were all-day events, featuring displays of vintage Kiss stage outfits, instruments and memorabilia; performances by Kiss cover bands; and dealers selling Kiss merchandise from every stage of the band's career. Kiss appeared live at the conventions, conducted question and answer sessions, signed autographs, and performed a two-hour acoustic set composed mostly of spontaneous fan requests. On the first U.S. date (June 17, 1995), Criss appeared onstage with Kiss to sing "Hard Luck Woman" and "Nothin' to Lose". It was the first time Criss had performed publicly with the band in nearly 16 years.<ref name="Sharp, pp. 108">Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 108–110.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 217.</ref>

===1996–2001: Original lineup reunion tour and remasking===
[[File:Kiss - Utrecht 1997.jpg|thumb|left|280px|Kiss performing in Utrecht in 1997]]

On August 9, 1995, Kiss joined the long line of musicians to perform on ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''. The band contacted Criss and Frehley and invited them to participate in the event. Both joined Kiss on stage for several songs at the end of the set: "Beth", "2000 Man", "Nothin' to Lose" and "Rock and Roll All Nite".<ref name="Sharp, pp. 108"/> The ''Unplugged'' appearance set off months of speculation that a possible reunion of the original Kiss lineup was in the works. In the weeks following the ''Unplugged'' concert, however, the band (with Kulick and Singer), returned to the studio for the first time in three years to record a follow-up to ''Revenge''. ''[[Carnival of Souls: The Final Sessions]]'' was completed in February 1996, but its release was delayed for almost two years. [[Bootleg recording|Bootleg]] copies of the album circulated widely among fans.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', pp. 403–404.</ref> While Kiss continued to exist publicly as Simmons, Stanley, Kulick and Singer, arrangements for a reunion of the original lineup were in the works. These efforts culminated with a public event as dramatic as any the band had staged since its 1983 unmasking on MTV. With the following statements, [[Tupac Shakur]] introduced the original Kiss lineup, in full makeup and ''Love Gun''-era stage outfits, to a rousing ovation at the [[38th Annual Grammy Awards]]:<ref name="grammy">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammyflashback/1996/ |title=Grammy Flashback 1996 |publisher=MTV |access-date=July 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020222002510/http://www.mtv.com/bands/g/news_feature_grammyflashback/1996/ |archive-date=February 22, 2002 }}</ref>

We had to be as good as people thought we were. The show wasn't to be a replica of what we've done, it was to be what people imagined we had done. We had to be totally committed. and also totally sure that we could not only live up the legend but also surpass it. In terms of the stage show for the reunion tour,  what we wanted to do was look at the '77 show in a sense as a pinnacle. That is what we chose to build on but not copy. There are also elements from other shows too in the sense that there's bombs and the flying rig and the breaking of the guitars. At that time, it was the ultimate Kiss show in the sense that we looked at the show, which we thought was our best and said, "Top this."<br>—Paul Stanley<ref>(2019).

In September 1998, the reunited group issued ''[[Psycho Circus]]''. Although it was the first album with the original lineup since 1979's ''[[Dynasty (Kiss album)|Dynasty]]'', the contributions of Frehley and Criss were minimal. While the images of Frehley and Criss are featured prominently on the album, most of the lead guitar work was later revealed to have been performed by future band member [[Tommy Thayer]]. Former member Kulick made an appearance on the intro of the song "Within". Most drum duties were handled by session musician Kevin Valentine. Despite the controversy, the album achieved a No. 3 chart debut, the highest position for a Kiss album until ''[[Sonic Boom (Kiss album)|Sonic Boom]]'' debuted at No. 2 in 2009.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267069/michael-buble-beats-kiss-on-billboard-200 |title=Michael Buble Beats Kiss On Billboard 200 |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |date=October 14, 2009 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=December 23, 2009}}</ref> The [[Psycho Circus (song)|title track]] received a Grammy nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance.<ref name="psychogrammy">{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/1999/grammys/bigpicture.html |title=41st annual Grammy nominees and winners |publisher=[[CNN]] |access-date=July 30, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218161056/http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/specials/1999/grammys/bigpicture.html |archive-date=December 18, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Psycho Circus Tour opened at [[Dodger Stadium]] in Los Angeles on Halloween in 1998, and was simulcast on FM radio across the U.S. It proved to be another success, and was historic for being the first to ever incorporate [[Dimension|3D]] visuals into a stage show.<ref>Leaf and Sharp, ''Behind the Mask'', p. 112, 115.</ref><ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 245.</ref>

On August 11, 1999, Kiss was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], in the "Recording Industry" category. The next month, the group worked in collaboration with [[World Championship Wrestling]] to produce a Kiss-themed wrestler known as [[Dale Torborg|the Demon]], whose face was painted to resemble Simmons' makeup. The group performed "[[God of Thunder (song)|God of Thunder]]" live on ''[[WCW Monday Nitro]]'' to debut the character.

===2001–2008: Post-reunion===
On the eve of the Japanese and Australian leg of the Farewell Tour on January 31, 2001, Criss suddenly left the band once again, because he and the band could not come to agreement with his contract salary. Taking his place was previous Kiss drummer Singer who, in a move that was controversial among longtime fans, assumed Criss's Cat persona as the Farewell Tour continued.<ref name="rosen">{{cite web |last=Rosen |first=Craig |date=January 31, 2001 |url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12054736 |title=Peter Criss Leaves Kiss, Eric Singer Steps In |work=Yahoo!

With the band supposedly set to retire by early 2001, a career-encompassing collection entitled simply ''[[The Box Set (Kiss)|The Box Set]]'', consisting of 94 tracks on five CDs, was released in November of that year, while the summer saw perhaps the most outrageous item of Kiss merchandise yet&nbsp;– the [[Kiss Kasket]]. In introducing the Kiss Kasket, Simmons quipped, "I love livin', but this makes the alternative look pretty damn good."<ref name="kasket">{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/06_2001/061401.asp|title=Kiss Introduce Their Latest Merchandising Endeavor: The Kiss Kasket|work=NYRock|access-date=July 30, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110055023/http://www.nyrock.com/worldbeat/06_2001/061401.asp|archive-date=November 10, 2006}}</ref>

On December 4, 2001, Kiss was one of the honorees at the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] ("The Recording Academy") Heroes Award ceremony, at the NARAS New York Chapter. NARAS has 12 chapters throughout the United States, hence 12 ceremonies throughout the year, with the honorees each being honored by the chapter closest to their residence. By receiving this honor, which NARAS has renamed the "Recording Academy Honors", Kiss effectively received NARAS' second-highest career honor, right behind the Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12046338 |title=Kiss Honored At Heroes Award Event To Benefit N.Y.C.

Kiss was relatively quiet through the rest of the year, but 2002 started with some controversy as Simmons took part in a controversial interview on [[National Public Radio]] with host [[Terry Gross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/TerryGrossInterviewWithGeneSimmons|title=Terry Gross interview with Gene Simmons|work=Internet Archive|access-date=August 13, 2009}}</ref> In February 2002, Kiss (with Singer on drums and Frehley on lead guitar) performed during the closing ceremony of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah.

On March 6, 2002, Kiss performed a private concert at a resort in [[Trelawny Parish|Trelawny]], Jamaica. Frehley, who was no longer under contract, did not perform with the group. He was replaced by Thayer, who donned Frehley's Spaceman makeup and costume for his first live appearance with Kiss.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 269.</ref> That month, the band (with Thayer) taped an appearance on the American sitcom ''[[That '70s Show]]''.<ref name="sitcom">{{cite web|url=http://www.tommythayer.com/about/ |title=About Tommy Thayer |access-date=January 27, 2007}}</ref> The episode, "That '70s Kiss Show", aired in August 2002. Thayer again performed with the group in April 2002, when Kiss performed "Detroit Rock City" (with pre-recorded music and live vocals) for an appearance on ''Dick Clark's American Bandstand 50th Anniversary'' show, which aired on May 3.<ref>Gooch and Suhs, ''Kiss Alive Forever'', p. 270.</ref>

In February 2003, Kiss traveled to Australia and recorded ''[[Kiss Symphony: Alive IV]]'' with the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]] at [[Docklands Stadium|Etihad Stadium]] (then known as Telstra Dome) in Melbourne. Thayer once again replaced Frehley, while Criss returned to the group.

Despite claims made prior to the Farewell Tour that it would be the group's last, Kiss toured with Aerosmith in 2003. Frehley announced that his departure from the band was permanent, stating that he believed the Farewell Tour would be Kiss's last,<ref>(July 25, 2003). ''Infoplease''.

Simmons and Stanley did not renew Criss's contract when it expired in March 2004. Criss, on his website, stated that "No one, again, no one has called me, or my attorney about an extension for future touring.

After the conclusion of the Rock the Nation Tour, Kiss performed only sporadically for a number of years. The group played two shows in 2005, and another six in 2006. Four of the 2006 shows were July concerts in Japan, including two dates (July 22 and 23) as a headlining act at the 2006 Udo Music Festival. Kiss performed four July 2007 concerts, three of which were dubbed the Hit 'N Run Tour. Prior to the final show on July 27, Stanley was hospitalized with an extremely rapid heartbeat. In his absence, Kiss performed in concert as a trio for the first time since 1982. This was the first Kiss concert that Stanley had missed during his then 34-year tenure with the group.<ref name="hospital">{{Cite news|title=Paul Stanley Hospitalized Prior To California Gig; Kiss Performs As Three-Piece |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/paul-stanley-hospitalized-prior-to-california-gig-kiss-performs-as-three-piece/ |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=July 28, 2007 |access-date=July 28, 2007}}</ref>

In 2007, a new comic book series featuring the band was released by the Kiss Comics Group in association with [[Platinum Studios]], titled ''Kiss 4K: Legends Never Die''.

The band picked up their pace in 2008, embarking on their first proper tour of Europe in nearly a decade. On January 30, 2008, Stanley confirmed that Kiss would launch the [[Kiss Alive/35 World Tour]], playing arena and stadium shows in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. On March 16, 2008, Kiss closed the [[Australian Grand Prix]] at [[Melbourne Grand Prix Circuit]] as well as performing in [[Brisbane]] and Sydney as part of this tour. Kiss played at the [[Rock2Wgtn]] two-day festival held in [[Wellington]], New Zealand, on March 22 and 23, 2008; the festival also featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Whitesnake]], Poison, Alice Cooper, [[Lordi]], Sonic Altar and Symphony of Screams, with special effects provided by [[Weta Workshop|WETA Workshop]] (of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[King Kong (2005 film)|King Kong]]'' fame).<ref>{{cite web|date=November 19, 2007|url= https://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?l=1&t=90&id=9719|title= 'Rock2wgtnÃ¢â'¬â"¢ announces the next big name for festival|work=Infonews.co.nz}}</ref>

It was the last show of the European leg of the Kiss Alive/35 Tour. On August 4, Kiss played at Rockin' the Rally at the [[Sturgis Motorcycle Rally]] as part of the tour. [[South Dakota]] Governor [[Mike Rounds]] proclaimed August 4, 2008 to be "Kiss Rock and Roll Day" in South Dakota. In September 2008, both Simmons and Stanley confirmed rumors that the Kiss Alive/35 Tour would continue with extensive tours of North America in the beginning of 2009, as well as South America. The latter tour included shows on April 5 in [[Argentina]], April 7 and 8 in [[Brazil]], April 14 in [[Peru]] (the first Kiss show ever in Peru), and other concerts in [[Venezuela]] (the first Kiss show ever in Venezuela) and [[Chile]].

===2008–2012: ''Sonic Boom'' and ''Monster''===
More than 10 years after their last studio album, and following years of denials about ever wanting to do a new album, Stanley and Simmons changed their minds. In November 2008, Stanley stated to rock photographer [[Ross Halfin]] that a new Kiss album was in the works. Stanley himself would be the producer, and the album would have a "real 70s Kiss sound" to it. Later that month, Simmons and Stanley both publicly confirmed the information about a new Kiss album:

All of us have taken up the songwriting call to arms in the same spirit we once did&nbsp;– without a care in the world and without outside writers. Nothing to prove to anyone. Just doing what comes naturally. Ignoring fashions, trends and with a personal vow from all of us: no rapping. There are plenty of people out there doing this and they don't need four palefaced guys pretending they're from the hood. Besides, I'm not sure how to correctly pronounce 'wassup.' See you all there ... Or maybe later!<ref name="kissonline.com"/>}}

The band appeared on ''[[American Idol]]'' in May 2009, performing "Detroit Rock City" and "Rock and Roll All Nite" with [[Adam Lambert]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1611891/20090520/kiss.jhtml|title=Adam Lambert Gets Glammed Up With Kiss|last=Montgomery|first=James|date=May 20, 2009|publisher=MTV|access-date=October 17, 2009}}</ref>

Kiss started the European leg of the [[Sonic Boom Over Europe Tour]] in May 2010. Tragedy struck Kiss for a third time when former manager Aucoin died of cancer on June 28, 2010, at the age of 66. Stanley and Simmons said he was like the fifth member of Kiss. The tour included their first UK arena shows in 11 years and their first visit to [[Slovakia]]. Kiss later played at two dates in US cities [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], Wyoming and the [[North Dakota State Fair]] in [[Minot]], North Dakota, in July 2010.

Simmons said: "Technology is a seductive bitch, she will seduce you. You press this button, you don't have to do anything. But analog is the love of your life. You can push real hard and it always gives back. For the new album, the actual recording process was 24-track tape and an old Trident board. And as many tubes as possible.

Kiss has typically been classified under the genres of [[hard rock]],<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Kiss Bio|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/kiss/biography|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171124074849/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/kiss/biography|archive-date=November 24, 2017|access-date=September 22, 2017|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> [[shock rock]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]],{{sfn|Lefcowitz|Preiss|1997}} [[glam metal]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Grobmeier|first=Danielle|date=November 12, 2015|title=Still Cowboys From Hell|url=http://interactives.dallasnews.com/2015/pantera/|access-date=May 26, 2021|website=[[The Dallas Morning News]]}}</ref> and [[glam rock]].<ref name="thomas4692">{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/kiss-mn0000084209/biography |title=((( Kiss > Biography))) |website=AllMusic |access-date=July 28, 2010}}</ref> Most of its 1970s albums, particularly the first six released between 1974 and 1977 as well as 1982's ''Creatures of the Night'' and 1984's ''Animalize'', featured a hard rock or traditional heavy metal style. 1979's ''Dynasty'' and 1980's ''Unmasked'' featured a more disco/[[pop rock]] sound, and 1981's ''Music from "The Elder"'' found the band dabbling in [[progressive rock]]. In 1983, starting with ''Lick It Up'' and the removal of its trademark make-up, the band began incorporating glam metal into its sound and visual image.<ref name="KISSglam">{{cite web |url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/K/KISS/2002/01/15/pf-746628.html |title=Canoe – Jam!

Its music is described as "a commercially potent mix of anthemic, fist-pounding hard rock, driven by sleek hooks and ballads powered by loud guitars, cloying melodies, and sweeping strings.

===Makeup designs===
The band is famous for its iconic makeup designs, each of which represents a different character or persona. The current lineup consists of the original four designs: the "Starchild", the "Demon", the "Spaceman" and the "Catman". The band formerly included a practice of giving any new members a new persona, such as "the Fox" for Carr and "the Ankh Warrior" for Vincent; this practice was ended after Singer and Thayer took up Frehley's "Spaceman" and Criss's "Catman" personas. When asked on the matter, Simmons stated "Why wouldn't we use the classic makeup? We own it". Criss relinquished his rights to his makeup when he left the band in 2004, which he later regretted, saying "I'm pissed at myself that my makeup slipped through my hands"; while Frehley claims he licensed his design to the band and would get it back, a notion which Stanley has called "a fantasy".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/gene-simmons-on-kiss-makeup-controversy-why-wouldnt-we-use-it-164306/ |title=Gene Simmons Talks Kiss Makeup Controversy |first1=Kory |last1=Grow |work=Rolling Stone |date=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

During 1973–74, Stanley occasionally used an alternative makeup design called the "Bandit" for select photo-shoots and live shows after [[Neil Bogart]], head of Casablanca Records, suggested to him that he use a design that was symmetrical like those of the rest of the band. During this time, he was also still using the Starchild makeup—sometimes even using both designs at the same photo-shoots. In 1974, he stopped using the Bandit design permanently. On the cover of the band's debut album, Criss used a drastically different variation of his Catman makeup (dubbed the "Pantomime Cat") after he allowed the makeup artist at the shoot to use their own ideas instead of following the usual design. Carr was originally going to be the "Hawk", a design which Simmons recalled in his autobiography looked like [[Big Bird]] from ''[[Sesame Street]]''. One photo of Carr wearing this proposed design exists today, and also one of a mannequin Stanley set up wearing the proposed makeup and outfit. Unlike the Bandit and Pantomime Cat, this alternative design was never used in any official capacity. The Hawk design was also considered for Vincent and Singer.<ref>"[http://metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php/metaltalk.net/columns_eighteen/chris_dale_undiscovered_kisstory_alternative_makeup.php Undiscovered Kisstory: Alternative Makeup Designs"] at Metaltalk.net</ref>

St. John and Kulick were members of Kiss only during the non-makeup period. Kulick stated that had he ever worn makeup in the band, he would have liked to have been the "Dog": "I figure that since there's already a cat in the band, I should probably be the dog. I'd have a big circle around one eye and I'd look like Petey from the [[Little Rascals]]. I've actually seen one or two fan renditions of what that might look like, so yeah, I'd be the dog." The four original makeup designs have been registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, with ownership and licensing rights held by Simmons and Stanley.

==Influences==
[[File:Noddy Holder - Slade - 1973.jpg|thumb|upright|British [[glam rock]] band [[Slade]] (pictured in 1973) was among the band's influences.]]
Kiss was strongly influenced by [[Alice Cooper]] and the [[New York Dolls]],<ref name=Konow2009>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZyBtHRq2ncQC&pg=PA48 |page=48 |title=Bang Your Head: The Rise and Fall of Heavy Metal |last=Konow |first=David |publisher=Crown/Archetype |year=2009 |isbn=9780307565600}}</ref> while Gene Simmons has stated that the band's "musical heart and soul lies in England".<ref name="Kiss influence">{{cite news |title=Kiss Founder Gene Simmons Says Band's 'Heart and Soul Lies in England' |url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/kiss-heart-and-soul-lies-in-england-says-gene-simmons/ |publisher=Ultimate Classic Rock |date=September 22, 2017}}</ref> [[The Beatles]] and the [[Yardbirds (band)|Yardbird's]] trio of rock guitarists [[Jimmy Page]], [[Eric Clapton]] and [[Jeff Beck]] were among the British acts he praised, with Simmons stating, "I've ripped off so many English riffs, if the British influence wasn't there, we wouldn't be here. 'Rock and Roll All Nite' is a direct bastard child of [[Slade]]'s '[[Mama Weer All Crazee Now]]'".<ref name="Kiss influence"/> In his book, ''Kiss and Make-Up'', Simmons wrote of the [[glam rock]] group Slade, "... we liked the way they connected with the crowd and the way they wrote anthems ... we wanted that same energy, that same irresistible simplicity".<ref>{{cite book |first1=Gene |last1=Simmons |title=Kiss and Make-up |year=2002 |publisher=Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-609-81002-2 |page=85 }}</ref>

The world of concert touring was changed by Kiss's practice of erecting uniquely designed stage sets. Tours got larger, carrying more personnel and equipment, including sets, costumes, sound and lighting gear, and pyrotechnics, all requiring more trucking and the total cost increasing by millions of dollars. Kiss also innovated with a significant expansion of concert merchandising, selling non-musical [[Kiss merchandising|Kiss-branded goods]] to concertgoers. The sales of merchandise helped pay for the concert expenses and bring a profit to the band as well as give them more of a presence without relying solely on radio. Other bands copied Kiss by selling their own branded goods at concerts, a practice which became more of a necessity in the 1980s with increasing costs of touring.<ref name=Konow2009/><ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.wired.com/2010/02/music-wont-pay-the-band/ |title=Music Won't Feed The Band – But Merch Might |last=Van Buskirk |first=Eliot |date=February 23, 2010 |magazine=Wired |access-date=May 28, 2015}}</ref> In addition to concert merchandising, Kiss has extended its influence to include a full Kiss-themed mini-golf course at the [[Rio All-Suite Hotel and Casino|Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino]] in Las Vegas, Nevada.<ref>{{cite news |last=Blabbermouth |date=2016-02-01 |title='Kiss By Monster Mini Golf' Moving To Rio All-Suite Hotel And Casino In Las Vegas |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/kiss-by-monster-mini-golf-moving-to-rio-all-suite-hotel-and-casino-in-las-vegas/ |access-date=2020-07-18 |website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=2019-06-19 |title=The wackiest and wildest mini-golf courses in Las Vegas |url=https://www.ktnv.com/positivelylv/the-wackiest-and-wildest-mini-golf-courses-in-las-vegas |access-date=2020-07-18 |website=KTNV}}</ref>
