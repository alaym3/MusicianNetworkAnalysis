==Early life==
Haddaway was born in [[Trinidad and Tobago]] in 1965. His mother was a nurse and his father was a marine biologist.<ref name=stay>{{Cite news | url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-03-13-ca-33314-story.html | title=HADDAWAY : Singer Won't Stay Long in Dance-Music Genre | first=DENNIS | last=HUNT | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=March 13, 1994 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> His parents separated in the early 1970s and Haddaway first lived with his father in Europe, then with his mother in America. He was raised in Chicago and moved to the [[Washington, DC metropolitan area]] at the age of 9.<ref name=stay/> Listening to [[Louis Armstrong]] encouraged Haddaway to learn how to play [[trumpet]] at the age of 14.<ref name=yme>{{cite web | url=http://yme-entertainment.com/haddaway/ |title=HADDAWAY | publisher=yme-entertainment.com}}</ref> He attended [[Meade Senior High School]] in [[Fort Meade, Maryland]], where he was a member of the [[marching band]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6w5wy6/one-hit-wondering-haddaway | title=One-Hit Wondering - Haddaway | first=Kristen Yoonsoo | last=Kim | work=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] | date=September 20, 2012}}</ref> which eventually resulted in him forming his first group titled "Chances".<ref name="yme" /> In 1987, Haddaway enrolled in [[medical school]], but dropped out due to lack of excitement<ref name="stay" /> and moved to [[Cologne]], [[West Germany]], where he mostly worked in bars.<ref name=yme/> Later, he formed his own company called "Energy", which was involved in organizing fashion shows and [[photo shoot]].<ref name=yme/>

==Career==
[[File:Haddaway.svg|thumb|right|Logotype used by Haddaway throughout his career.]]
In 1992, Haddaway was signed by German label [[Coconut Records]]. His debut single, "[[What Is Love]]", rapidly became popular in Europe, reaching number 2 in Germany and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref name=casebook/> In Germany, the single sold 900,000 copies.<ref name=casebook/> In the United Kingdom, it received a [[music recording certification]] of Gold for shipment of 400,000 units.<ref name=BRIT>{{cite web | url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/brit-certified/ |title=BRIT Certified | publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]]}}</ref> It later reached number 11 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/music/haddaway | title=Haddaway | publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> and was certified Gold for shipments of 500,000 units.<ref name=casebook/> By the beginning of 1994, worldwide sales of "What Is Love" reached 2.6 million.<ref name=casebook/>

His second single, "[[Life (Haddaway song)|Life]]", reached number 2 in Germany, number 6 in the United Kingdom, and number 41 in the US, and its worldwide sales reached 1.5 million by 1994.<ref name=casebook/> The follow-up singles "[[I Miss You (Haddaway song)|I Miss You]]" and "[[Rock My Heart]]" also reached the Top 10 in Europe and established him as a successful [[Eurodance]] artist. His first LP, ''[[The Album (Haddaway album)|The Album]]'' (also known as ''Haddaway'' in the US), was a multi-million seller which reached Platinum status in Germany for shipments of 500,000,<ref name=certificationde>{{cite certification|region=Germany|artist=Haddaway}}</ref> and Gold in the UK and in France for shipments of 100,000.<ref name=BRIT/><ref name=infodisc>{{cite web |url=http://infodisc.fr/Certif_Album.php |title=InfoDisc: Les Certifications (Albums) du SNEP (Bilan par Artiste) |publisher=infodisc.fr |language=French}}</ref>

In 1995, he released his second album, ''[[The Drive (album)|The Drive]]'', which included the UK top 20 hit "[[Fly Away (Haddaway song)|Fly Away]]", as well as "[[Catch a Fire (song)|Catch a Fire]]" and "Lover Be Thy Name". "What Is Love" enjoyed a resurgence in popularity as the theme music for the Butabi brothers ([[Will Ferrell]] and [[Chris Kattan]]) on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''<ref>{{cite news | url=https://rare.us/rare-humor/this-legendary-snl-skit-with-jim-carrey-redefines-the-question-what-is-love/ | title=This legendary SNL skit with Jim Carrey redefines the question "What Is Love?" | work=[[Rare (website)|Rare]] | date=February 21, 2016}}</ref> and the 1998 film ''[[A Night at the Roxbury]]''.<ref name=said/>

The albums ''[[Let's Do It Now]]'' (1998) and ''My Face'' (2001; re-released as ''Love Makes'') all failed to chart.

Haddaway appeared on the television show ''Comeback – [[Die große Chance]]'' in Germany in 2004. He appeared on the UK version of ''[[Hit Me, Baby, One More Time (TV series)|Hit Me, Baby, One More Time]]'' in 2005 and subsequently appeared on the U.S. version. This exposure led to him scoring a moderate chart hit in Germany with the ballad "Spaceman" from his next album, ''Pop Splits''.

In 2008, "What Is Love" was featured in a commercial for [[Diet Pepsi MAX]] that aired during [[Super Bowl XLII]] which parodied the [[leitmotif]] and included several stars including [[LL Cool J]], [[Missy Elliott]], and [[Busta Rhymes]], but Haddaway himself did not appear in the ad.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/1313337/super-bowl-wrap-jackson-petty-sparks-and-more | title=Super Bowl Wrap: Jackson, Petty, Sparks And More | first=Ann | last=Donahue | work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] | date=February 3, 2008}}</ref>

In 2008, Haddaway teamed up with Eurodance star [[Dr. Alban]] for the single "I Love the 90's".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/i-love-the-90s-mt0032194526 | title=Dr. Alban / Haddaway: I Love the 90's | publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> In 2009, "What Is Love" re-entered charts after German DJ [[Klaas (DJ)|Klaas]] remixed it. The track resurfaced again in 2010 when it sampled heavily in Eminem's single "No Love" featuring Lil Wayne. In 2012, Haddaway released the single "Up and Up" with [[the Mad Stuntman]], which was a top 20 dance hit in the US.<ref name=said>{{cite news | url=https://www.flavorwire.com/504266/we-asked-haddaway-what-is-love-heres-what-he-said | title=We Asked Haddaway, "What Is Love?" Here's What He Said | first=Jillian | last=Mapes | work=[[Flavorwire]] | date=February 12, 2015}}</ref>

In 2011, he said that most of his performances are in "the east", in places such as [[Kazakhstan]], [[Uzbekistan]], or [[Siberia]].<ref name=schoko>{{cite news | url=https://www.express.de/koeln/-what-is-love--saenger-haddaway-trauert-um-koelsche--schoko-clique--15021512 | title="What is Love"-Sänger Haddaway trauert um kölsche "Schoko-Clique" | trans-title="What is Love" singer Haddaway mourns the Cologne "chocolate clique" | work=express.de | date=August 21, 2011 | language=de}}</ref>

In 2016, he announced plans to star in ''Neverending Dream'', a film about Eurodance. Despite launching a fundraiser on [[Indiegogo]], the film was not released.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.factmag.com/2016/02/13/haddaway-never-ending-dream-eurodance-movie/ | title=90s icon Haddaway is starring in a film about Eurodance | first=Parker | last=Freeman | work=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]] | date=13 February 2016}}</ref>
