==Career==
===2017–2019: Career beginnings===
In 2017, while considering enrolling in the [[Florida State University]] film school, Cain began experimenting with creating reverb-heavy choral inspired music on [[GarageBand]]. From 2017 to 2018, she released her works to a small following of friends and followers on [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]], under the names White Silas and Atlas. In 2019, following the release of her debut single as Ethel Cain, titled 'Bruises', she connected with artist [[Nicole Dollanganger]] through social media, opening for Dollanganger on the artist's 'Heart Shaped Bed' tour in Chicago.

In September 2019, she released a small collection of songs titled ''Carpet Bed'', her first extended play under the Cain moniker.

In December 2019, after the release of her ''Golden Age'' EP, she was backed by artist [[Wicca Phase Springs Eternal]], who praised Cain for her "mature songwriting and understanding of melody".<ref>{{cite web|date=December 5, 2019|title=Wicca Phase tells us his top 10 LPs of 2019; tour w/ Glitterer, Creeks, Anxious begins|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/wicca-phase-tells-us-his-top-10-lps-of-2019-tour-w-glitterer-creeks-anxious-begins/|url-status=live|work=[[Brooklyn Vegan]]}}</ref>

===2020-present: ''Inbred''===
In January 2020, after recommendation from Wicca Phase Springs Eternal, Cain was discovered by rapper [[Lil Aaron]]. While headlining a show with Girlfiend, Edith Underground, and Lil Bo Weep in [[Los Angeles]], Cain was invited to meet with [[Dr. Luke]]'s publishing company Prescription Songs and signed with them soon after.

After the [[COVID-19]] epidemic began, Cain became housebound in quarantine. In August 2020, she moved from Florida into a church outside of [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]], [[Indiana]], where she would finish recording her first EP as a non-independent artist, titled ''Inbred''. The EP, entirely written, produced, and mixed by Cain, was a departure from the heavier dream-pop sound of ''Golden Age'' and a step towards a cleaner, more alt-rock inspired sound.

In February 2021, Cain released her first single under the new publishing contract, titled "Michelle Pfeiffer" featuring Lil Aaron.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kent|first=Matthew|date=February 11, 2021|title=Ethel Cain reflects on the freedom of LA with revelatory new single "Michelle Pfeiffer"|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/song-of-the-day/ethel-cain-michelle-pfeiffer|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2021-02-19|website=Paper Mag|language=en}}</ref> The song was premiered on [[Paper (magazine)|Paper]] and featured on [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']], [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']], [[Nylon (magazine)|''Nylon'']], and [[The Fader (magazine)|''The Fader'']].<ref>{{cite web|date=February 12, 2021|title="Michelle Pfeiffer" [ft. lil aaron]|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/ethel-cain-michelle-pfeiffer-ft-lil-aaron/|url-status=live|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=February 12, 2021|title=First Out: New Music from Rebecca Black, Big Freedia, Syd & More|url=https://www.billboard.com/index.php/articles/news/pride/9525731/first-out-rebecca-black-big-freedia-syd|url-status=live|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=February 15, 2021|title=Soundcheck: The 10 Best Music Released The Week of February 15th,2021|url=https://www.nylon.com/entertainment/soundcheck-02-15-2021/amp|url-status=live|work=[[Nylon (magazine)|Nylon]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=February 15, 2021|title=10 songs you need in your life this week|url=https://www.thefader.com/2021/02/18/best-songs-playlist-serpentwithfeet-ethel-caine-men-i-trust|url-status=live|work=[[The Fader (magazine)|The Fader]]}}</ref> She announced her third EP titled ''Inbred'', featuring a collaboration with Wicca Phase Springs Eternal.
