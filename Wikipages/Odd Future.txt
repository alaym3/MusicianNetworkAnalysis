==Controversies and incidents==
Odd Future was scheduled to appear at the February 2014 Rapture Festival in [[Auckland]], as a supporting act to [[Eminem]]. The group was not on the original bill, but was substituting for [[Kendrick Lamar]] after the concert had been sold out.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11195753 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20140213215317/http://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=11195753 | url-status=dead | archive-date=February 13, 2014 | title=Kendrick Lamar pulls out of Rapture show | date=February 2, 2014 }}</ref> A campaign was launched by an anti-violence group to prevent Odd Future performing, based partly on prior occurrences of the group supposedly inciting violence by their fans towards members of the public, and by the group's lyrics allegedly supporting rape and violence towards women.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/auckland/whats-on/entertainment/9714206/Call-to-ban-Odd-Future|title=Call to ban Odd Future|work=Stuff|date=12 February 2014}}</ref> Immigration New Zealand canceled the visa of some group members because of alleged acts of inciting violence.

In 2015, Tyler, the Creator was banned from the United Kingdom for 3–5 years due to the allegedly homophobic and violent content of his lyrics from earlier albums such as ''[[Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)|Bastard]]'' and ''[[Goblin (album)|Goblin]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2015/08/26/tyler-the-creator-banned-from-u-k-forced-to-cancel-shows/ |title=Tyler The Creator Banned From U.K., Forced To Cancel Shows |publisher=BallerStatus.com |date=August 26, 2015}}</ref>

Tyler's UK ban has since been lifted,<ref>{{Cite tweet|user=tylerthecreator|number=1129682696765038592|title=LONDON; IGOR; 3PM; WILL UPDATE YOU LATER WITH LOCATIONpic.twitter.com/bscofwIxta|last=Creator|first=Tyler, The|date=May 18, 2019|website=@tylerthecreator|access-date=June 6, 2019}}</ref> concurring with his show in London to promote his fifth studio album,  ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]''. However, his show was forcibly cancelled by police after they voiced their safety concerns, saying that it was "overcrowded" and "too rowdy".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-48321716|title='Rowdy' crowd stops rapper's surprise gig|date=May 18, 2019|access-date=June 6, 2019}}</ref>
