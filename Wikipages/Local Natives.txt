==History==

===2005–2011: Formation and ''Gorilla Manor''===
{{Main|Gorilla Manor}}
The band came together in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], where Kelcey Ayer, Ryan Hahn, and Taylor Rice attended [[Tesoro High School]]. One year after graduating college at UCLA, they were joined by bassist Andy Hamm and drummer Matt Frazier.  In December 2008, they all moved to a house in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles, California|Silver Lake]] and started work on their debut album.<ref name="frenchkiss">{{cite web |url=http://frenchkissrecords.com/bands/profile/local_natives/ |title=Frenchkiss Records |publisher=Frenchkiss Records |date=2013-01-29 |access-date=2015-07-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127171231/http://frenchkissrecords.com/bands/profile/local_natives/ |archive-date=2012-11-27 }}</ref>

Everything the band creates comes from a complete collaboration between their members, from songwriting to artwork.<ref name="frenchkiss" /> Their debut album, ''[[Gorilla Manor]]'', was named after the house they all shared in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], where most of the album was written. “It was insanely messy and there were always friends over knocking around on guitars or our thrift store piano,” said Hahn. “It was an incredible experience and I’ll never forget that time.” <ref name="frenchkiss" /> The self-funded ''Gorilla Manor'' was recorded by Raymond Richards in his own [[Red Rockets Glare|Red Rockets Glare Studio]], in West Los Angeles, and was produced by Richards and the band.<ref name="frenchkiss" />

====Touring====
The band started to attract the attention of the music press after playing nine shows at the 2009 [[South by Southwest|SXSW]] festival in [[Austin, Texas]], where initial reviews drew favorable comparisons to [[Arcade Fire]], [[Fleet Foxes]], and [[Vampire Weekend]],<ref>{{cite news

In 2010, the group's song ''Wide Eyes'' became known in Australia after appearing during an election campaign advertisement for the [[Australian Democrats]].
In 2011, they embarked on a European tour, served as opening act for [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros]], and made their debut in [[Australia]] at [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival]]<ref>{{cite web

====Hamm's departure====
It was announced March 18, 2011 that the band had parted ways with bassist Andy Hamm. A post on the band's website stated, "It is with extremely heavy hearts that we announce that we have recently parted ways with our bassist Andy Hamm. Due to unresolved differences within the band, we strongly feel that, in order to continue in a positive direction, this is the best course of action. We wish Andy the best and will miss him deeply."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://outtasightblog.tumblr.com/post/3948291807/unfortunate-news

===2012–2013: ''Hummingbird''===
{{Main|Hummingbird (Local Natives album)}}
[[File:Local Natives.jpg|thumb|250px|Local Natives onstage at Optimus Primavera Sound in 2013]]
At [[Lollapalooza]] the band announced that they built a new studio and were working on completing their second full-length album, ''[[Hummingbird (Local Natives album)|Hummingbird]]'', which was released January 29, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lollapalooza Sun Hands Performance|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/lollapalooza?blend=1&ob=5#p/search/1/ll3x0DvUjjo|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=2015-07-12}}</ref> ''Hummingbird'' was produced by [[Aaron Dessner]] of [[The National (band)|The National]], and though it departed from the "battle-cry urgency" of Gorilla Manor's ''Sun Hands'', singer/guitarist Taylor Rice doesn't look at 'Hummingbird' as a darker album pointing out moments of optimism, and attributing the altered subject matter to the changes and emotions that came in the years since their debut, such as Ayer's mother passing away from breast cancer.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lau |first=Melody |url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/FromTheMagazine/local_natives-growth_spurt |title=Local Natives Growth Spurt |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=2013-02-25 |access-date=2015-07-12}}</ref>

On April 29, 2016, Local Natives released a new single, "[[Past Lives (Local Natives song)|Past Lives]]", saying, "The world is not static, it’s made new over and over again. But we tend to live the same patterns in a loop, loving the same way, wrestling the same demons, the same dynamics playing out around us again and again. Untangling every moment and decision that led us to where we are now can make fate feel concrete, inescapable. But our world is not fixed, it’s constantly reemerging, and we can change it into whatever we want.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transversomedia.com/articles/local-natives-new-single-past-lives |title=Local Natives Return to the Present With New Single "Past Lives" — TRANSVERSO |publisher=Transversomedia.com |date=2016-04-29 |access-date=2017-05-18}}</ref> In May 2016, the band premiered the first songs from the album live.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/local-natives-new-album-2016-show-review-hollywood-forever|title=We Caught the First Preview of Local Natives' New Album at a Surprise LA Show - Noisey|website=noisey|language=en-us|access-date=2016-09-13}}</ref>
