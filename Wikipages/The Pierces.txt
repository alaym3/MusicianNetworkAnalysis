Allison started dancing at age three, and both sisters are accomplished ballet dancers.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Musical career==
===2000–2006: ''The Pierces'' and ''Light of the Moon''===
It was while they attended [[Auburn University]] that a friend sent a tape to a record company in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. This eventually resulted in their debut album ''[[The Pierces (album)|The Pierces]]'' (2000). It featured folk harmonies and "adult alternative" songs. In a 2004 interview, Allison Pierce commented that the album "sort of got lost in the shuffle".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://porticomag.com/dec04/whotoknow.html|publisher=Portico Birmingham|title=Who to know|accessdate=2007-07-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701171742/http://porticomag.com/dec04/whotoknow.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive -->|archivedate=2007-07-01}}</ref> Allmusic attributes the poor reception to "no label support".<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p442746|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|title=The Pierces Overview|accessdate=2007-08-24 }}</ref>

On August 10, 2004, their second album ''[[Light of the Moon]]'' was released through Universal. The album was produced by Brian Sperber and featured 11 tracks that the Pierce sisters either wrote or co-wrote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popmatters.com/shorttakes/2005_03_06_archive.shtml|publisher=Pop Matters|title=Pop Matters Short Takes|accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> The original version of the song "Save Me" appeared in the television series ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tunefind.com/show/roswell/season-2/21505|work=[[Tunefind]]|title=Roswell – The End of the World|accessdate=October 10, 2018}}</ref> and The Pierces re-recorded a new version of the song for ''Light of the Moon''.

===2007–2010: ''Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge''===
On March 20, 2007, their third album ''[[Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge]]'' was released in the U.S. Produced by [[Roger Greenawalt]] (Nils Lofgren, Radish, Ben Kweller), the album has been well-reviewed, particularly for the single "Boring", which parodies celebrity socialites. The album has a darker, edgier style, at times using such diverse instruments as an accordion, a calliope, bassoons, a sitar, violins, an autoharp, and a Hawaiian lap steel. It marks a definitive change in the direction of the band, which hitherto had been known as a [[folk rock]] band.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/43771/the-pierces-thirteen-tales-of-love-and-revenge/ |publisher=Pop Matters|title=The Pierces: Thirteen Tales of Love and Revenge - PopMatters Music Review|accessdate=2007-08-24}}</ref> In an interview with ''Rolling Stone'', after they were featured as a Rolling Stone Breaking Artist, they revealed that this album "felt like [their] last chance". As a result, they "just went for it, had fun".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/meet-rolling-stones-new-breaking-artist-the-pierces-90694/ |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|title=Meet Rolling Stone's New Breaking Artist, the Pierces|date=16 May 2007|accessdate=11 August 2021}}</ref>

On December 5, 2007, The Pierces appeared on [[The CW]] television series ''[[Gossip Girl (TV series)|Gossip Girl]]'', in the episode "[[Hi, Society]]", playing their songs "[[Secret (The Pierces song)|Secret]]" and "Three Wishes". They also featured songs such as "Boy In a Rock and Roll Band" in season 2 and "We Are Stars" in season 4.

On August 21, 2008, "Secret" by The Pierces appeared in a promo for Showtime show ''[[Dexter (TV show)|Dexter]]''.<ref>[http://www.sho.com/site/video/brightcove/series/title.do?bcpid=1305238289 Promo] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629012845/http://www.sho.com/site/video/brightcove/series/title.do?bcpid=1305238289 |date=2009-06-29 }}</ref> In May 2009, Dutch TV channel [[NET 5]] used "Secret" in a promo for their fantasy shows ''[[Charmed]]'' and ''[[Ghost Whisperer]]''. "Secret" was also played over the closing credits in the movie ''[[ExTerminators (film)|ExTerminators]]''.

"Secret" also serves as the theme song of the [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] TV series ''[[Pretty Little Liars]]'', based on the series of books by [[Sara Shepard]]. It was suggested by one of the stars of the show, [[Ashley Benson]], after she heard from ''Gossip Girl''. In 2012, the single "Secret" was also featured in a commercial for the Australian version of the reality series ''[[Big Brother (Australian TV series)|Big Brother]]''. It was used in a video to promote the novel "Three Can Keep a Secret" by [[Archer Mayor]].

On October 23, 2010, the group appeared on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]''. In December 2010, the sisters and their band toured with [[Lissie]] as her support act. They also performed live on ITV1 show ''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]'' in March 2011 whilst promoting their new single "[[Glorious (The Pierces song)|Glorious]]".

On May 30, 2011, their fourth album ''[[You & I (The Pierces album)|You & I]]'' was released featuring their new singles "Love You More", "[[You'll Be Mine (The Pierces song)|You'll Be Mine]]", "Glorious" and "It Will Not Be Forgotten" produced by darktones and released by [[Polydor Records]]. However, The Pierces only have a label currently in the UK and are therefore focusing on widening their popularity there, later working on their homeland the US.

They went on their first official tour through June 2011, with Delta Maid and [[Alice Gold]] as support: 7 June-The Pleasance ([[Edinburgh]]), 8 June-Rescue Rooms ([[Nottingham]]), 9 June-The Cockpit ([[Leeds]]), 11 June-The Ruby Lounge ([[Manchester]]), 12 June-HMV Institute ([[Birmingham]]), 13 June-Thekla ([[Bristol]]), 14 June-Bush Hall ([[London]]).

The Pierces played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 2011.

The Pierces supported [[Coldplay]] at the [[iTunes Festival]] in July 2011, which happened to be on Alison's 36th birthday. A second, much larger UK tour took place through October 2011, with [[Marcus Foster]] as support. On 11 September 2011, the duo announced via [[Twitter]] that their next UK single from ''[[You & I (The Pierces album)|You & I]]'' will be "Kissing You Goodbye", which was released on 23 October. The Pierces supported Coldplay once again for their North American tour in April–May 2012. They appeared at the Edmonton, Calgary, Vancouver, Portland, Seattle, San Jose and Los Angeles shows, as well as supporting them in their Australian tour
