==Biography==
It is quite hard to define precisely when Luan Santana’s music career actually started. Born on March 13, 1991, in [[Campo Grande]] (MS), Luan first captured his family’s eye at the age of three as he couldn’t stop singing Brazilian country music songs (‘sertanejo’ songs) in perfect pitch. He used to perform sertanejo standards such as ‘Muda de vida’, ‘Chico Mineiro’ and ‘Cabocla’ effortlessly, without forgetting the lyrics.

== Career ==
Start a Fast Forward caption and we are at the summer of 2009 his hard work paid off: his career exploded and Luan Santana broke all audience records in the cities he performed. He started winning more and more fans and followers wherever he went – even today his loyal fans and followers are some of the most fervent you'll ever find. Luan followed the monumental success of his second release with a participation in “[[Festa do Peão de Barretos]]” (Barretos’ Cowboy Festival), where he performed for a 50-thousand-people-audience, who sang along all his main hits with him. He received rave critical reviews from the specialized media of Barretos who considered him one of the greatest examples of the [https://tvefamosos.uol.com.br/colunas/leo-dias/2020/01/03/com-musicas-tocadas-mais-de-um-milhao-de-vezes-luan-e-o-maior-da-decada.htm ‘phenomenon of sertanejo music’] and stated that he would surely emerge as rising star after that. The specialized media proved to be right: Luan held 300 concerts in Brazil in 2009, featuring an average of 25 performances a month. He was definitely a star.
