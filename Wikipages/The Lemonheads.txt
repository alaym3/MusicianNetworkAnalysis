After their initial punk-influenced releases and tours as an independent/[[college rock]] band in the late 1980s, the Lemonheads' popularity with a mass audience grew in 1992 with the major label album ''[[It's a Shame about Ray]]'',<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> which was produced, engineered, and mixed by The Robb Brothers ([[Bruce Robb (producer)|Bruce Robb]], Dee, and Joe). This was followed by a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Simon and Garfunkel]]'s "[[Mrs. Robinson]]", which eventually became one of the band's most successful [[single (music)|singles]]. Then Lemonheads were active until 1997 before going on hiatus, but reformed with a new lineup in 2005 and released ''[[The Lemonheads (album)|The Lemonheads]]'' the following year. The band released its latest album, ''[[ Varshons 2]]'', in February 2019.<ref name="newalbum">[http://www.punknews.org/article/26558 Lemonheads full length, reissue due next year], ''Punknews.org'', November 16, 2007.</ref>

Since its formation, recording and touring lineups of the band have included co-founders Deily and Peretz, [[John Strohm (musician)|John Strohm]] ([[Blake Babies]]), Doug Trachten, [[T. Corey Brennan|Corey Loog Brennan]], Byron Hoagland (Folks On Fire), Ben Daughtrey ([[Squirrel Bait]]), [[Juliana Hatfield]] ([[Blake Babies]]), [[Nic Dalton]] (Godstar, [[Sneeze (band)|Sneeze]], [[The Plunderers (band)|The Plunderers]]), David Ryan ([[Fuzzy (band)|Fuzzy]]), [[Murph (drummer)|Patrick "Murph" Murphy]] ([[Dinosaur Jr]]), [[George Berz]] ([[Dinosaur Jr]], Gobblehoof), Josh Lattanzi, Bill Gibson ([[The Eastern Dark]]), Mark 'Budola' Newman, [[Kenny Lyon]], Vess Ruhtenberg, Devon Ashley, [[Karl Alvarez]] and [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] ([[Descendents]]), P. David Hazel and various others.

==History==

===Early years (1986–1991)===
[[Evan Dando]], [[Ben Deily]] and [[Jesse Peretz]] formed the Lemonheads as teenagers at the [[Commonwealth School]] in [[Boston]]. The band was originally called the Whelps, until inspiration came from a [[Lemonhead (candy)|brand of candy]], which Dando noted was "sweet on the inside and sour on the outside."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thequietus.com/articles/07502-the-lemonheads-its-a-shame-about-ray|title=20 Years On: The Lemonheads' Its A Shame About Ray Revisited|first=John|last=Freeman|date=November 30, 2011|website=[[The Quietus]]}}</ref> The band recorded and self-released the 7" EP ''Laughing All the Way to the Cleaners.''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evandando.co.uk/interviews/laughingalltheway.html |title=Evan Dando & The Lemonheads – Discography – Billboard |publisher=Evandando.co.uk |date=1986-08-19 |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref> The band's first show was played on August 19, 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vnWvvERm6L4 |title=Evan Dando |publisher=YouTube |date=1967-03-04 |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref>

After high school, Dando enrolled at [[Skidmore College]] but could not maintain his grades and dropped out to pursue a musical career. Having signed to local label [[Taang! Records]], the Lemonheads released the albums ''[[Hate Your Friends]]'' (1987), ''[[Creator (Lemonheads album)|Creator]]'' (1988), and ''[[Lick (album)|Lick]] (1989)'' with Deily and Dando sharing lead vocals and songwriting duties.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Initially they also shared lead guitar and drumming duties as well, but when this became unworkable, they hired drummers such as Doug Trachten, [[John Strohm (musician)|John Strohm]], and Mark Natola to fill out the lineup.  As all three albums were compiled from various recording sessions from 1986 onward, the lineups one each album varied considerably from song to song.  The band enjoyed a good deal of [[college radio]] airplay and were popular in the burgeoning [[indie rock]] scene, up until Deily left the band in 1989. Dando then recruited David Ryan on drums, and [[Corey Loog Brennan]] as a second guitarist, and signed to [[major label]] [[Atlantic Records]], releasing the album ''[[Lovey (album)|Lovey]]'' in August 1990.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Straddling punk rock, [[country music]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], ''Lovey'' was released a year before the commercial explosion of [[grunge]], and failed to chart or produce any songs with serious airplay.

===Breakthrough and height of fame (1992–1997)===
Dando cut his losses and flew to Australia to write some songs with friends [[Nic Dalton]] and [[Tom Morgan (musician)|Tom Morgan]]. These songs formed the basis for ''[[It's a Shame about Ray]]'', the Lemonheads' breakthrough album.  In the intervening time, Jesse Peretz had left music, and had taken up a career in photography and film; he would remain as the band photographer, and would eventually go on to direct music videos, TV shows, and feature films.  Replacing Peretz in the band was [[Juliana Hatfield]], who provided bass and backing vocals.  Hatfield would leave the band shortly after recording the album to found her own band, The Juliana Hatfield Three, she would be replaced on bass by Nic Dalton.  A cover of "[[Mrs. Robinson]]" (recorded to promote the video release of ''[[The Graduate]]'') was released as a single and got them the most exposure they had had so far. This cover was also used in the film ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'' and in [[Martin Scorsese]]'s 2013 film ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]''. When the ''Ray'' album was reissued, the track was tacked on to the end.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The band enjoyed some success on college radio as well as mainstream exposure. The title track, "[[It's a Shame About Ray (song)|It's a Shame About Ray]]," also saw commercial success. During 1992–1993, Dando's face graced many magazine covers, and he was included in ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'''s 50 Most Beautiful People list.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evandando.co.uk/interviews/people.htm |title=Evan Dando & The Lemonheads – Interviews – People May 1993 |publisher=Evandando.co.uk |date=1993-05-03 |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref>

Now consisting of Dando, Dalton, and Ryan, the band officially renamed themselves from "Lemonheads" to "The Lemonheads" prior to the release of ''[[Come on Feel the Lemonheads]]'' in October 1993.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>  Though no longer playing bass, Hatfield did appear as a backing singer on many of the tracks.  The album also featured guest appearances by [[steel guitar]]ist [[Sneaky Pete Kleinow]] and singers [[Belinda Carlisle]] and [[Rick James]].  This was a successful album with tracks such as "Big Gay Heart" and "It's About Time." The band enjoyed modest mainstream success, this time with the single "[[Into Your Arms]]" (their highest charting UK hit to date).<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Writer Robyn St. Clare made the first recording of this song in 1990 as part of Love Positions with Nic Dalton.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9D7wXD1XeQs |title=Into Your Arms (original version) |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2010-04-15 |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref>

Dando befriended [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and appeared at the band's live shows. The cracks were beginning to show, and after one particularly disjointed interview with Dando almost unable to speak, having lost his voice after smoking [[crack cocaine]], he admitted to having a drug problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.evandando.co.uk/interviews/q93.htm |title=Evan Dando & The Lemonheads – Interviews – Q November 1993 |publisher=Evandando.co.uk |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref>  The band went on hiatus and Dando went into rehab.

In 1996, Dando re-formed The Lemonheads with a completely new lineup, including drummer Murph (formerly of [[Dinosaur Jr]]), bassist Bill Gibson (formerly of The Eastern Dark), and guitarist John Strohm (formerly of the [[Blake Babies]]; Strohm had also played drums with the Lemonheads during their early years).  This band produced another Lemonheads album, ''[[Car Button Cloth]]''. While featuring jangly guitar songs such as "If I Could Talk I'd Tell You," this set also showed off the darker side of Dando's writing.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

The band contributed to ''[[Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks]]'', a 1996 tribute album for ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' creator Thomas G. Yohe, which contained remakes of many popular ''Schoolhouse Rock!'' songs – The Lemonheads offered their take on "My Hero Zero."  Previously, the band had contributed to a Kiss tribute album, recording Kiss' 1977 song "Plaster Caster" for ''[[Kiss My Ass: Classic Kiss Regrooved]]'' (1994).

The band toured successfully in 1997 and played a final gig at the UK's [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]]. Following a cameo line in the [[BBC]]'s all-star cover version of [[Lou Reed]]'s "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]" (which reached number one in the [[UK Singles Chart]]), Dando continued to play live solo shows.

===Hiatus (1998–2004)===
Atlantic released ''The Best Of The Lemonheads'' in August 1998.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Through 1998 and 2004 Evan Dando undertook  some solo tours performing the band's songs but an official reunion was never confirmed. During this time, Dando released a live album ''Live at the Brattle Theatre'' in 2001, and a solo album in 2003, titled ''[[Baby I'm Bored]]''. He also co-wrote the song "The Last High" with [[Courtney Taylor-Taylor]] of [[The Dandy Warhols]] for the album ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House (album)|Welcome to the Monkey House]]'' by The Dandy Warhols.

===Return (2005–present)===
[[Image:Thelemonheads.jpg|thumb|The Lemonheads at Shepherd's Bush Empire, September 2005]]After a nine-year hiatus, the band reformed in the summer of 2005 with a recording lineup bolstered by [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] and [[Karl Alvarez]], members of [[Descendents]]. The live lineup during this period fluctuated, with Stevenson  and George Berz ([[Dinosaur Jr]]) both sitting in on drums during 2005, while [[Josh Lattanzi]]—chiefly known for his work with [[Ben Kweller]]—has frequently taken on bass duties for live shows.

On September 14 and 15, 2005, Dando, Stevenson and Lattanzi performed two shows at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] in London as part of the ATP Don't Look Back series, where they played ''[[It's a Shame About Ray]]'' in its entirety.

In April 2006, The Lemonheads were signed to [[Vagrant Records]]. The album, simply titled ''[[The Lemonheads (album)|The Lemonheads]]'', was released on September 26, 2006 in the United States and one day earlier in the UK; the album featured special guests [[Garth Hudson]] and [[J Mascis]] on select tracks. To promote the album Dando toured the UK, Europe and US in late 2006 with a band consisting of Vess Ruhtenberg (bass) and Devon Ashley (drums) of The Pieces. In the US, they toured with Vietnam and [[Hymns (band)]] as support. The same line-up toured again in 2007 and 2008. The recording line-up of Dando, Alvarez and Stevenson played live for the first time together on a 20-date US tour in late 2007.

While The Lemonheads reformed, co-founder Deily received a degree from [[Harvard University]]. He currently works as an Associate [[Creative Director]] in the advertising industry. His power pop/punk band, Varsity Drag, completed a 25-city European tour during January and February 2007, performing their own material alongside several Deily compositions from the first four Lemonheads releases. Varsity Drag continues to perform periodically in the Boston Area.<ref>The Boston Phoenix, November 13, 2007</ref>

A deluxe reissue of Lemonheads' 1992 album ''It's a Shame About Ray'' was released in March 2008 (US) and April 2008 (UK) on [[Rhino Records]],<ref name="newalbum" /> which features [[demo (music)|demos]], [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]] and a [[DVD]] issue of the previously VHS-only ''Two Weeks In Australia'', featuring footage from the band's Australian tour in the wake of their breakthrough album's release. To promote the reissue, the line-up of Dando, Ruhtenberg and Ashley performed the album in full at a number gigs between March and May 2008. Later in 2008 the band toured again in Europe with Vess Ruhtenberg and P. David Hazel (drums) of Beta Male.

On April 23, 2008, at the inaugural ''[[NME]]'' US Awards ceremony at the El Rey in Los Angeles, Dando received the classic album award for ''It's A Shame About Ray'', and also performed "My Drug Buddy" and the album's title track acoustically. According to reports, soon after receiving the award, Dando deposited it into a garbage can, telling a minder "I don't want this".<ref>{{cite web|last=Ross |first=Dalton |url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2008/04/25/lemonheads-evan/ |title=Lemonheads' Evan Dando trashes NME Award &#124; Inside TV &#124; EW.com |publisher=Insidetv.ew.com |date=2008-04-25 |access-date=2014-04-19}}</ref>

On June 23, 2009, The Lemonheads released ''Varshons'' – a collection of eleven covers, including tracks by [[Gram Parsons]], [[Wire (band)|Wire]], [[GG Allin]], and [[Christina Aguilera]]. The album also featured actress [[Liv Tyler]] performing a [[duet (music)|duet]] on [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "Hey That's No Way To Say Goodbye".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/72777/the_lemonheads|title=The Lemonheads upcoming album featuring Liv Tyler and Kate Moss!|access-date=2009-03-31|date=2009-03-28|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref> Despite several websites reporting a release date of September 13, 2008, the album was not released on this date. Later, in a blog post on the band's MySpace page, Dando hinted at a March 2009 release. On March 27, 2009, it was announced that Varshons would be released on June 23 on The End Records.

In an August 2007 interview, drummer [[Bill Stevenson (musician)|Bill Stevenson]] stated that he was going to produce the Lemonhead's ninth album of original material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/26558 |title=Lemonheads full length, reissue due next year |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/25179 |title=Stevenson talks about next Lemonheads album |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-07-17}}</ref> As of August 2010, however, announcements of a new album have not yet been released.

In September 2010 the Lemonheads announced an Australian tour playing all thirteen songs from the 1992 album ''[[It's a Shame about Ray]]'', plus a selection of songs from other albums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicpron.com/news/2010/10/05/the-lemonheads-tour/ |title=MusicPron |publisher=MusicPron |access-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714134437/http://www.musicpron.com/news/2010/10/05/the-lemonheads-tour/ |archive-date=2011-07-14 }}</ref>

On February 7, 2012, The Lemonheads will release Hotel Sessions on Hall of Records/Breath of Saltwater – an intimate recording documenting a Sunday night that Evan Dando spent recording new songs with just an acoustic guitar (and some revealing commentary) in a hotel room in Bondi Beach, Australia. The 14 songs include some that never made it to an official Lemonheads album, but Dando says, “the "Into Your Arms" I did here is better than the one on the album (I like it anyway).” <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelemonheads.net/ |title=Lemonheads.net |publisher=Lemonheads |access-date=2012-03-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704151404/http://www.thelemonheads.net/ |archive-date=2016-07-04 }}</ref>

The Lemonheads completed a 9-week U.S. tour in spring of 2012 playing all thirteen songs from the 1992 album ''[[It's a Shame about Ray]]'', plus a selection of songs from other albums. Lead singer [[Evan Dando]] recruited drummer [[Chuck Treece]] and former [[Taking Back Sunday]] lead guitarist [[Fred Mascherino]] to play bass.

[[Juliana Hatfield]] rejoined The Lemonheads for a late 2012 tour supporting [[The Psychedelic Furs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/08/juliana-hatfield-rejoins-the-lemonheads-for-psychedelic-furs-tour/ |title=Juliana Hatfield Rejoins the Lemonheads for Psychedelic Furs Tour |publisher=spin.com |date=2012-08-21 |access-date=2012-08-24}}</ref>

On September 17, 2012 Ryan Adams tweeted that he would be playing drums on a new 'punker sounding' Lemonheads album as well as producing it. He also announced that Evan Dando would be joined on the record by Juliana Hatfield and, for the first time since 1989's Lick, co-founder and original co-songwriter Ben Deily.  Like the earlier Bill Stevenson produced sessions, however, no album was released.

The Lemonheads played a seven-date tour in Ireland and the UK in October 2015.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Stickler|first1=Jon|title=The Lemonheads Line Up Autumn UK And Ireland Tour|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/192919/9|access-date=7 January 2017|work=Stereoboard|date=28 July 2015}}</ref>

On August 14, 2017, [[Atlantic Records]] divested the Lemonheads' back catalogue to [[Fire Records (UK)|Fire Records]], which released several of the band's albums in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/warner-sells-atlantics-the-lemonheads-catalogue-to-fire-records|title=Warner sells Atlantic's The Lemonheads catalogue to Fire Records – Music Business Worldwide|date=14 August 2017}}</ref>

A second album of covers (the band's first album in a decade), titled ''[[Varshons 2]]'', was released in 2019.

== Personnel ==
During the earliest years, the band consisted of Evan Dando, Ben Deily, and Jesse Peretz.  Dando and Deily shared singing and songwriting duties; when recording or performing live each would sing and play guitar on their own compositions while the other would play drums. When the arrangement became unworkable, they hired additional drummers including Doug Trachten and John Strohm. On most of the first three albums (released by independent label TAANG!), songs from various recording sessions and live tracks are mixed, so instrumentation varies considerably from track-to-track depending on who was in the band when the tracks were recorded. CD versions of these albums were also released with bonus tracks from even later line-ups of the band.

When Deily quit the band in 1989, Dando replaced him with guitarist Corey Loog Brennan and drummer Mark Natola.  Natola would be replaced by drummer David Ryan prior to the band's first major label album, ''[[Lovey (album)|Lovey]]''. Following the recording of ''Lovey'', founding bass player Jesse Peretz left the band to pursue a career in photography and filmmaking, and Brennan left to concentrate on his career as a college professor.

On their breakout album, ''[[It's a Shame About Ray]]'', Juliana Hatfield had joined on bass guitar and backing vocals. She would remain the backing vocalist for the follow-up album ''[[Come on Feel the Lemonheads]]'', but would be replaced on bass guitar by Nic Dalton. John Strohm, who had previously played drums with the band during their early years, toured with the band as a second guitarist in support of these albums.

Starting with 1996's ''[[Car Button Cloth]]'' and continuing through the present, the band membership has been fluid, with the name The Lemonheads generally being used by whomever Evan Dando had recruited to record and/or play with at the time. Their last official release was 2019's collection of cover songs ''[[Varshons 2]]'', which followed on from their prior release, 2009's ''[[Varshons]]''. Several announcements of albums of new material or tours involving any number of musicians have been announced over the years since then, most recently a 2012 project involving Ben Deily, Juliana Hatfield, and Ryan Adams, but as yet no major recordings or substantial tours have materialized.

Below is an approximate timeline of membership in The Lemonheads.  Other than Evan Dando, the band has rarely had a stable line-up.  The timeline below shows only members which were primary recording or touring members. It does not include guest musicians, or ephemeral line-ups which only appeared on stage under The Lemonheads moniker for one-off shows or brief appearances. Dates of membership are approximate based on known shows and recordings.
