== Career ==

=== 2003–2007: Early career and ''Victim of Truth'' ===
Nneka first gained public attention in 2004 while performing as an opening act for dancehall reggae star [[Sean Paul]]<ref name=":0" /> at [[Hamburg Stadtpark]], and following much acclaim, she announced her intentions to record her first album. After releasing her debut EP, ''The Uncomfortable Truth'', she performed on her first tour in April 2005, playing shows in Germany, Austria and Switzerland.
In 2005, Nneka's debut album, ''Victim of Truth,'' was released across Europe, Nigeria and Japan. Garnering rave reviews from the media, the UK's Sunday Times later declared ''Victim of Truth'' "the year’s most criminally overlooked album".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Edwards|first=Mark|title=Nneka: Victim of Truth|newspaper=[[The Times]]|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nneka-victim-of-truth-qn0s0cc2nx5|access-date=2021-02-05|issn=0140-0460}}</ref> Despite universal acclaim, the record did not manage to chart. Nevertheless, Nneka enjoyed a sustained and successful period of touring, performing with label-mate [[Patrice Bart-Williams]]. During her tour, she played at Chiemsee Reggae Summer, [[Haarlem]] (Bevrijdingsfestival), [[The Hague]] (Park Pop) and [[Saint-Brieuc]] (Art Rock Festival), and in respected venues, such as La Maroquinerie and [[New Morning (club)|New Morning]] in Paris, Tivoli in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], Paradiso in [[Amsterdam]], and Cargo and [[ULU]] in London. She has also supported artists such as [[Femi Kuti]], [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]], [[Seeed]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]].

In 2006, Nneka also performed on the German television network [[WDR Fernsehen|WDR]], where she performed her single "Gypsy", while a dance group performed a dance routine they had worked on specifically for the song. The dance group was supported by the organization Schlauberger.

=== 2008- 2011: ''No Longer at Ease'' and ''Concrete Jungle'' ===
In February 2008, she released her second album, ''No Longer at Ease.''<ref name=":0" /> The title of the album is taken from a novel of the same name by [[Chinua Achebe]] and reflects the lyrical content of the record. Many of the songs are political, talking about the plight of the [[Niger Delta]] and the corruption in Nneka's homeland. ''No Longer at Ease'' combines the political and the personal in "a winning mix of soul, hip-hop and reggae".<ref>'Rhymes and punishment', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 23 August 2009</ref> The lead single from the record, "Heartbeat", became Nneka's first song to break into the German Top 50.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/|title=AllMusic {{!}} Record Reviews, Streaming Songs, Genres & Bands|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> In September 2009, the song entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at no. 20.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/Voice |title=UK Singles & Albums Official Charts Company - Nneka - Heartbeat |publisher=[[Official Charts Company]] |date=17 October 2009 |access-date=27 October 2010}}</ref> "Heartbeat" has since been remixed several times, most notably by [[Chase & Status]],<ref>{{Citation|last=Pál Osváth|title=Nneka - Heartbeat (Chase & Status Remix)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUsm3PCoGIE|access-date=2019-01-10}}</ref> was sampled by [[Rita Ora]] for her chart-topping single, "[[R.I.P.
