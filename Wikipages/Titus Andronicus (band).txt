'''Titus Andronicus''' is an American [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Glen Rock, New Jersey]], in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=Margaret Reges |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/titus-andronicus-mn0001011840/biography |title=Titus Andronicus &#124; B]iography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2015-10-17}}</ref> The band is composed of singer-lyricist-guitarist [[Patrick Stickles]], guitarist Liam Betson, bassist R.J. Gordon, and drummer Chris Wilson. The group takes its name from the [[Shakespeare]] play ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'', and has cited musical and stylistic influences such as [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] and [[Pulp (band)|Pulp]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lindsay |first=Cam |url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=122&csid2=946&fid1=31628 |title=Titus Andronicus: Interviews |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-11-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090315083832/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=122&csid2=946&fid1=31628 |archivedate=2009-03-15 |df= }}</ref>

==Career==
Titus Andronicus's first album, ''[[The Airing of Grievances (album)|The Airing of Grievances]]'', was released in April 2008 and was described as the sound of a "violent, overblown and irreverent" indie band in a positive review by ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11202-the-airing-of-grievances/ |title=Titus Andronicus: The Airing of Grievances &#124; Album Reviews |website=Pitchfork |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref> The band went on extensive tours of North America and Europe to promote the album through 2009, including a "Bring On The Dudes Tour" with friends [[the So So Glos]] and tours opening for [[Ted Leo and the Pharmacists]] and [[Lucero (band)|Lucero]].<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Titus+Andronicus/+events |title=Titus Andronicus Tour Dates and Concerts — |website=Last.fm |date=2013-11-26 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref>

In 2010 the band released their second album, ''[[The Monitor (album)|The Monitor]]'', through [[XL Recordings]]. A sprawling concept album loosely based on themes relating to the American Civil War, it was critically well received,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-monitor/titus-andronicus |title=Reviews for The Monitor by Titus Andronicus |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref> and debuted at No.&nbsp;7 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Heatseekers chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2010-03-27/heatseekers-albums|title=Heatseeking Albums: week of March 27, 2012|website=Billboard.com|accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> That month, ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' named the band one of the seven best new bands of 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/best-new-bands-of-2010-free-energy-grace-potter-and-the-nocturnals-and-five-more-20100317 |title=Best New Bands of 2010: Free Energy, Grace Potter and the Nocturnals and Five More &#124; Music News |work=Rolling Stone |date=2010-03-17 |accessdate=2012-11-13}}</ref> The band continued their extensive touring that included a tour of record stores, tours opening for [[the Pogues]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]], and [[Okkervil River]], plus appearances at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], [[Lollapalooza]], and [[Roskilde Festival]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/> Titus Andronicus recorded a version of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s "Breed" for the tribute album ''[[Newermind]]'' at this time as well.

Their third album, ''[[Local Business]]'', was released in 2012. A more stripped down record, Local Business was recorded live in the studio with almost no overdubs, creating an album that was "plug-in-and-play" ready, helping the band sound as close as possible to the album when playing live.<ref name="cohen1">{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Ian|title=Titus Andronicus Local Business|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17258-local-business/|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=22 April 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LOCAL BUSINESS: THE NEW TITUS ANDRONICUS LP|url=http://titusandronicus.net/blog/431/local-business-the-new-titus-andronicus-lp|work=Titus Andronicus|publisher=XL Recordings|accessdate=22 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029035833/http://titusandronicus.net/blog/431/local-business-the-new-titus-andronicus-lp|archive-date=29 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The band released their fourth album, ''[[The Most Lamentable Tragedy]]'', on 2015 via [[Merge Records]]. Taking the form of a 93-minute, 29-song, five-act [[rock opera]] (including covers of [[Daniel Johnston]] and [[the Pogues]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/59456-titus-andronicus-announce-new-album-the-most-lamentable-tragedy-share-dimed-out-lyric-video/ |title=Titus Andronicus Announce New Album The Most Lamentable Tragedy, Share "Dimed Out" Lyric Video &#124; News |website=Pitchfork |date=2015-04-30 |accessdate=2015-07-28}}</ref> Stickles described the record as a "complicated metaphor about manic depression, melding elements of philosophy, psychology, and science fiction through the plight of one troubled protagonist’s inner demons." The band also disclosed a film element to the album and thus far released a 15-minute music video covering Act Two.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://consequenceofsound.net/2013/09/titus-andronicus-new-album-will-be-a-30-track-rock-opera-about-manic-depression/ |title = Titus Andronicus’ new album will be a 30-track rock opera about manic depression |last = Roffman |first = Michael |website = [[Consequence of Sound]] |date = 3 September 2013|accessdate= 21 January 2014 }}</ref> ''The Most Lamentable Tragedy'' was released to positive reviews,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/the-most-lamentable-tragedy/titus-andronicus |title=Reviews for The Most Lamentable Tragedy by Titus Andronicus |publisher=Metacritic |date= |accessdate=2015-10-17}}</ref> and the group announced a "TMLT Around the World Tour" covering the United States and Europe.
