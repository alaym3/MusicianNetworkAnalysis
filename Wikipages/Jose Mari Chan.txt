Chan was exposed to music in his childhood with his maternal grandmother from Cebu often playing music at their house and his mother being a pianist. He was also accompanied by the family's house helper to participate in the radio program ''Children's Hour'' on DYRI where children performed the piano, sang, and recited poetry.<ref name="esquire1"/> At school he was often selected to perform in school programs. [[Paul Anka]] and [[Neil Sedaka]] are among the songwriters which served as his inspiration in his childhood. Chan wrote his first song at age 13.<ref name="esquire1"/> Chan's father was supportive of his involvement in Children's Hour but was reluctant of supporting his music career by the time he was age 14 or 15 when he began composing songs. His father was concerned their Chinese background would put Chan at a disadvantage in the music industry and encouraged him to relegate his music pursuits as a hobby and to pursue a business career instead. When Chan reminded the older gentleman that he did have a flair for composing, he was told that that particular field "would not be enough to support a family." It was then he realized the wisdom and concern voiced by his parent.<ref name="esquire2">{{cite news |last1=Gutierrez |first1=Angelica |title=Jose Mari Chan, (Not) The Father of Philippine Christmas Carols |url=https://www.esquiremag.ph/long-reads/esqa/jose-mari-chan-doesn-t-want-to-be-called-the-father-of-philippine-christmas-carols-a00225-20171124-lfrm2 |access-date=3 September 2019 |work=Esquire |date=24 November 2017}}</ref>

Since he was a junior student at that time at Ateneo and he was being encouraged to become a businessman, his father only consented his involvement if he was not paid salary for the stint.<ref name="esquire2"/> His first single "Afterglow" was released in 1967. He would release his first album two years later.<ref name=LSupport>{{cite news|last=Valisno|first=Jeffrey O|title=Local Support|url=http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=35138|newspaper=Business World Online|date=21 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923221528/http://www.bworldonline.com/weekender/content.php?id=35138|archive-date=23 September 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> after he was approached by an independent record producer.<ref name="esquire2"/>
