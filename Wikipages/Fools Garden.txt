'''Fools Garden''' (until 2003 known as '''Fool's Garden''') is a German band formed in 1991 in the city of [[Pforzheim]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://bnn.de/gewinnspiel/sommerraetsel/fools-garden-landeten-1995-den-zitronenbaum-hit|title=Fools Garden landeten 1995 den Zitronenbaum-Hit|publisher=Badische Neueste Nachrichten|lang=de|access-date=31 July 2018}}</ref> The founders of the group and the only permanent members are vocalist [[Peter Freudenthaler]] and guitarist Volker Hinkel.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pz-news.de/region_artikel,-Fools-Garden-gibt-Open-Air-Konzert-im-Pfarrgarten-in-Neuhausen-_arid,1293568.html|title="Fools Garden" gibt Open-Air-Konzert im Pfarrgarten in Neuhausen|publisher=Pforzheimer Zeitung|lang=de|access-date=17 November 2019|author=Susanne Glas|date=7 May 2019}}</ref> In 1993, bassist Thomas Mangold, keyboardist Roland Röhl and drummer Ralf Wochele were invited to join Fool's Garden for recording of the first studio album ''[[Once in a Blue Moon (Fool's Garden album)|Once in a Blue Moon]]''.

The band became famous worldwide in 1995 owing to the release of their second studio album ''[[Dish of the Day (album)|Dish of the Day]]'' and, in particular, the song "[[Lemon Tree (Fool's Garden song)|Lemon Tree]]", which entered numerous music charts around the world and topped five of them. However, Fool's Garden was never able to repeat the success of their only hit.<ref name="ZV">{{cite web|url=http://www.zvuki.ru/R/P/26276/|title=Под сенью лимонного дерева|publisher=Zvuki.Ru|lang=ru|date=21 September 2011|access-date=16 September 2016|author=Дед Звукарь}}</ref> A series of failures to replicate the commercial success of ''Dish of the Day'' in 1997, 2000 and 2003 resulted in tension and disagreement amongst the band's members, and dramatically discredited its reputation in the eyes of record label executives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cheriefm.fr/artistes/fool-s-garden|title= Fool's Garden|publisher=Cherie FM|lang=fr|access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="laut.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Fools-Garden|title=Fool's Garden|publisher=laut.de|lang=de|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> Consequently, Mangold, Röhl, and Vochele left Fool's Garden in 2003, but a year later new musicians joined the band. To signify the change, it was decided to remove the apostrophe from the band's name on their next album, ''[[Ready for the Real Life]]''. Due to the problems caused by the lack of a label ready to work with Fools Garden, the members of the band founded their own company Lemonade Music in 2004.<ref name="laut.de"/>

Fools Garden's musical style has been characterized as [[pop rock]], [[soft rock]], [[Britpop]] and some other genres. Critics have noted the influence of such artists as [[The Beatles]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], and [[The Who]].<ref name="intercord"/> The group may be classified as a [[one-hit wonder]].

Since its formation in 1991, the band has released 9 studio albums, received 12 music awards, and played over a thousand live performances. The bands's total sales have exceeded 6 million copies.<ref name="WIJK?">{{cite web

After a while, Hinkel and Freudenthaler discovered a newspaper advertisement, in which it was proposed to record an album for 130 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]].<ref name="Fan-Club"/> This is how ''Magazine'' was recorded.<ref name="Fan-Club"/> In addition to the songs recorded on the promo cassette, the album included two songs written by Hinkel with Claus Wissler, as well as a cover version of the song "[[I Am the Walrus]]" by The Beatles. This limited edition album was the precursor for the promo album ''[[Fool's Garden (album)|Fool's Garden - Man in a Cage]]'' (simply abbreviated as ''Fool's Garden'') released in 1991. They also decided to include a cover version of the song "[[Cry Baby Cry]]", which was sung by Volker Hinkel, as well as the songs "Scared" and "No Flowers By Request", which Hinkel recorded with Claus Wissler.<ref name="Volker-Fan-Club"/> In order to perform the recorded material live, it was decided to invite bassist Thomas Mangold, keyboardist Roland Röhl and drummer Ralf Wochele, and rename the band to Fool's Garden.<ref name="conference">{{cite web|url=https://www.rnz.de/nachrichten/mosbach_artikel,-mosbach-lemon-tree-in-neckarzimmern-fools-garden-bei-der-tagungsstaette-der-evangelischen-jugend-_arid,295404.html|title=Fools Garden bei der Tagungsstätte der Evangelischen Jugend|publisher=Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung|lang=de|access-date=16 November 2019|date=12 August 2017|author=Peter Lahr}}</ref> According to Peter Freudenthaler, the name "Fool's Garden" was the most consistent with the band's philosophy and suited the description of its members.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wradio.com.co/escucha/archivo_de_audio/en-que-andara-peter-freudenthaler-vocalista-de-la-banda-alemana-fools-garden/20161202/oir/3321068.aspx|title=¿En qué andará Peter Freudenthaler, vocalista de la banda alemana, fools garden?|publisher=W Radio|author=La Hora del Regreso|lang=es|date=2 December 2016|access-date=25 November 2019}}</ref>

=== Early career and first successes (1991–1994) ===
The eponymous promo-album, which was dedicated to [[John Winston Lennon]], got no recognition.<ref name="laut.de"/> There were only five copies ever produced.<ref name="FG25"/> The band's first singles "Careless Games / Tell Me Who I Am" and "Once in a Blue Moon / Spirit '91" were released in 1992.<ref name="FG25"/> Due to the lack of the opportunity to rehearse and record songs in a professional studio, the members of the young band were forced to meet several times a week in the living room of Volker Hinkel's parental home.<ref name="Doc"/> In the same year, Fool's Garden first appeared on radio, television (TV channels [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR 3]] in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Tele 5]] in [[Munich]]) and began performing their first concerts in Pforzheim, which made them famous in their region.<ref name="FG25"/><ref name="laut.de"/>

In 1993 the band decided to re-record the songs from the promo CD and release the first full-length studio album ''[[Once in a Blue Moon (Fool's Garden album)|Once in a Blue Moon]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/fools-garden-mn0000181200|title=Fool's Garden — Music Biography, Credits and Discography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|author=Jason Ankeny|lang=en|access-date=10 November 2019}}</ref> It was originally released by the group independently on the Town Music label with a circulation of one thousand copies.<ref name="FG25"/><ref name="viet"/> The CDs were sold mainly at concerts, sent to local radio and TV stations, and were also given away for free.<ref name="FG25"/> To promote the new material, Fool's Garden immediately embarked on an extended concert tour throughout [[Baden-Württemberg]] and adjoining [[Bavaria]].<ref name="laut.de"/><ref name="conference"/> As Peter Freudenthaler recalled, at that time the band mainly performed in small municipal halls in front of a small audience.<ref name="conference"/> According to him, only 20 people came to the first Fool's Garden concert in Munich.<ref name="conference"/> It is also worth noting that on ''Fool's Garden'' and ''Once in a Blue Moon'', the lead vocals were equally divided between Peter Freudenthaler and Volker Hinkel.

The album ''Once in a Blue Moon'' turned out to be a commercial failure, resulting in Town Music label suffering heavy losses and even ending up on the verge of bankruptcy.<ref name="viet"/> The company's management was going to cancel the contract with the band, but after a series of negotiations, Steffen Koch managed to convince the head of Town Music to retain the partnership with Fool's Garden until [[Dish of the Day (album)|the next studio album]] was released.<ref name="viet">{{cite web|url=https://thethaovanhoa.vn/video/van-hoa/lemon-tree-neu-cuoc-doi-fools-garden-thieu-mot-cay-chanh-n20170224082507370.htm|title='Lemon Tree' – Nếu cuộc đời Fool's Garden thiếu một cây chanh…|publisher=Thể thao & Văn hóa|author=Nguyên Minh|access-date=23 November 2019|date=26 February 2017|lang=vi}}</ref> Moreover, despite all the efforts of the band and its producer, large companies did not dare to work with Fool's Garden.<ref>{{cite journal

 | quote = Nobody would have anything against a new big hit, but I think, even if we would have it like the "Lemon Tree", it would not be the same anymore. Because this opens so many doors for the very first time in our lives: we'd been the first time on the plane for a concert, we'd been the first time outside Europe, we'd been the first time outside of Germany for a concert, for a radio show, for a TV show - everything was for the first time with that song. Another big hit would not ever bring the same feeling again.

 | quote = Being compared to [[The Beatles]] is a big and not entirely deserved compliment. Of course, in today's guitar pop music, it's impossible to do without someone else's influence. On the other hand, in order to be successful, the group must still have identity. Whatever they say, Fool's Garden has its own style. We ourselves have heard how they already say about some young German groups: "Oh! Sounds like Fool's Garden!"

Fool's Garden are considered the followers of the Britpop wave that swept the world in the 90s, and the most prominent representatives of the German Britpop scene.<ref name="Zvuki-2008"/><ref name="cz"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockfaces.ru/styles/britpop.htm|title=Brit Pop|lang=ru|publisher=rockfaces.ru|access-date=15 December 2019}}</ref> The band is also one of the most iconic German performers on the international music scene along with the [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]], [[E-rotic]], [[Fun Factory (band)|Fun Factory]] and [[Mr. President (band)|Mr. President]].<ref name="Bubblegum"/><ref name="DishDay"/> Wolfgang Spahr, the German Bureau Chief of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', presented Fool's Garden the "Ambassador Award" for great success in Asia in the 1996's final issue.<ref name="Bubblegum"/>

Fool's Garden have been recognized as one of the most famous and typical [[one-hit wonder]]s.<ref name="faznet"/><ref name="Commersant"/> However, despite the fact that, in addition to "Lemon Tree", Fools Garden no longer released commercially successful singles,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://caracol.com.co/radio/2019/12/27/entretenimiento/1577478096_673229.html|title=Archivo Radioacktiva con Fool's Garden|publisher=Caracol Radio|lang=es|date=27 December 2019|access-date=31 December 2019}}</ref> various sources also highlight other quite popular songs: "Wild Days", "It Can Happen", "Why Did She Go?", "Innocence", "Probably", "Suzy", "Closer", "Dreaming" and "Does Anybody Know?".<ref name="moby"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foolsgarden.de/english/e_band_i.html|title= LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: FOOLS GARDEN |publisher=foolsgarden.de|lang=en|access-date=25 December 2018}}</ref><ref name="blatte"/> In the interview for ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine]]'', Peter Freudenthaler stated that he thought about many songs that they would become hits, but this never happened.<ref name="faznet"/>

In 2012, Alexander Rusakov, in his book "Who is Who, or MUZPROSVET in Global Contemporary Popular Music", put Peter Freudenthaler on #792 in the rating of 1000 best musicians of global contemporary popular music for participation in Fool's Garden.{{sfn|Русаков|2012|p=282}} The band was mentioned to play the fundamental role in the formation of modern retro-rock trends.<ref name="Zvuki-2008"/> In the magazine ''Novyi Ochevidets'', the song "Lemon Tree" was named the main German hit of the 90s.<ref>{{cite journal
