== Career ==

===Film===
[[File:Neil_Patrick_Harris_2013.png|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A man with dark blonde hair speaks into microphones away from the camera|Harris at ''[[The Smurfs 2]]'' premiere in 2013]]
Harris began his career as a [[child actor]] and was discovered by playwright [[Mark Medoff]] at a drama camp in [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]].<ref>{{cite episode |title=Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Neil Patrick Harris |series=[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]] |airdate=January 1, 2009 |season=1 |number=3 }}</ref> Medoff later cast him in the 1988 drama film ''[[Clara's Heart]]'', starring [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and based on the novel of the same name by [[Joseph Olshan]]. ''Clara's Heart'' earned Harris a [[Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] nomination. The same year, he starred in ''[[Purple People Eater (film)|Purple People Eater]]'', a children's fantasy.

Harris's first film role as an adult was 1995's ''[[Animal Room]]'', although he portrayed a teenager. His subsequent film work has included supporting roles in ''[[The Next Best Thing]]'', ''[[Undercover Brother]]'', and ''[[Starship Troopers (film)|Starship Troopers]]''. In 2004, Harris played a fictionalized, hyper-womanising, lewd version of himself in the ''Harold and Kumar'' [[Stoner film|stoner]] [[comedy film]]s ''[[Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle]]''.  It was the shift from roles associated with his sanitized "Doogie Howser" character to the more unscrupulous and bawdy part in the ''Harold & Kumar'' franchise that liberated Harris and revitalized his acting career, leading to his now-iconic role of Barney Stinson in ''How I Met Your Mother'' the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/32989-harold-kumar-go-to-white-castle-turns-10-but-how-did-neil-patrick-harris-get|access-date=2020-11-24|publisher=bustle|title='Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle' Turns 10, but How Did Neil Patrick Harris Get Involved?|archive-date=January 31, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131215048/https://www.bustle.com/articles/32989-harold-kumar-go-to-white-castle-turns-10-but-how-did-neil-patrick-harris-get|url-status=live}}</ref>  He would go on to reprise this role in the sequels: ''[[Harold & Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay]]'' and ''[[A Very Harold & Kumar 3D Christmas]]''.

In 2010, Harris provided [[voice acting]] for the role of the adult [[Dick Grayson]] ([[Nightwing]]) in the animated film ''[[Batman: Under the Red Hood]]'' and the [[beagle]] Lou in the film ''[[Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore]]''. The same year, he played the lead in the [[Independent film|indie]] comedy ''[[The Best and the Brightest (film)|The Best and the Brightest]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Neil Patrick Harris Lands Two Film Roles |url=http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Neil-Patrick-Harris-1006709.aspx |work=[[TV Guide]] |access-date=June 8, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612022301/http://movies.tvguide.com/Movie-News/Neil-Patrick-Harris-1006709.aspx |archive-date=June 12, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On March 7, 2010, he made a surprise appearance at the [[82nd Academy Awards]], delivering the opening musical number.

In 2014, Harris showed a more serious side in ''[[Gone Girl (film)|Gone Girl]]'', directed by [[David Fincher]]. Harris co-starred in the film as Desi Collings, the wealthy and obsessed ex-boyfriend of Amy Dunne, played by [[Rosamund Pike]]. Harris has said: "I was pinching myself at the opportunity" to work with Fincher. He received general praise from critics for his performance, as did the film.<ref>{{cite news |title= Neil Patrick Harris on Gone Girl: 'I was pinching myself' |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/neil-patrick-harris-gone-girl-hedwig |access-date= November 8, 2016 |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 2014-10-02 |last1= Walters |first1= Ben |archive-date= November 9, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161109091349/https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/oct/02/neil-patrick-harris-gone-girl-hedwig |url-status= live }}</ref>
