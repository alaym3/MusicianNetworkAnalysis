'''Numéro#''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[electropop]] [[duet (music)|duo]] from [[Montreal]] formed by [[France|French]] Jérôme Rocipon and [[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]] Pierre Crube.

==Biography==
Jérôme Rocipon is originally from the region of [[Bordeaux]]  in [[France]], and was a guitarist in various [[rock 'n roll]] groups in [[France]] with interests in [[hip hop music]].  He started to correspond with Pierre Crube, a Québécois living in [[Montreal]], and composer of experimental [[electronic music]].  The two exchanged their compositions on the [[Internet]].  From this exchange, the project Numéro# was born, whose compositions were put online on [[MySpace]].

Their first album, ''[[L'Idéologie des stars]]'', was released in 2006 on the [[independent label]] [[Saboteur Musique]] in Montreal.  The duo performed heavily, including notably opening up for [[TTC (band)|TTC]].  A single, "Hit pop", started to receive play on commercial top 40 radio, which is unusual for an independent group.

The band's second single, "Chewing-Gum Fraise", is their biggest hit in Québec. The song's video was the #2 video of the year on [[MusiquePlus]].

==Collaborations==
The [[Rap music|rap]] group [[Omnikrom]] appeared on the album ''L'Idéologie des stars'' in one of the versions of their single "Chewing-gum fraise".  In the spring of 2007, Numéro# returned the favour and collaborated with Omnikrom on their first album, ''Trop Banane!'', appearing on the tracks "Ghetto Hype" and "Bouger Bouger".
