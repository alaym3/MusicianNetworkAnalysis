'''Polo & Pan''' are a French music duo consisting of Paul Armand-Delille (aka Polocorp or Polo) and Alexandre Grynszpan (aka Peter Pan or Pan).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newyorker.com/recommends/listen/the-enchanting-electro-pop-of-polo-and-pan|title=The Enchanting Electro-Pop of Polo & Pan|website=The New Yorker}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcrw.com/music/articles/kcrw-exclusive-polo-pan-record-picks|title=KCRW Exclusive: Polo & Pan Record Picks|date=November 12, 2019|website=KCRW}}</ref> Their music style incorporates a mixture of electronic music influenced by tropical sounds and world music from all over the world. The duo has released two studio albums and a number of successful EPs. The 2021 single "[[Ani Couni Chaouani|Ani Kuni]]" is their biggest chart song.

==Career==
The two were known individually through their performances in the Parisian bar "Le Baron" where they met in 2012. First they started mixing existing songs before launching their own compositions found in their debut EP ''Rivolta'' and the follow-up EP ''Dorothy'' released on the Hamburger Records / Ekler'o'Shock labels. Their third EP release ''Canopée'' in 2016 resulted in their first charting sing, the same-titled "Canopée" produced by Raphaël Hamburger of Hamburger Records and Matthieu Gazier of Ekler'O'shock.

In 2017, they collaborated with musician Jacques Auberger, known by the mononym Jacques, resulting in the single "Jacquadi". This was followed on 19 May 2017 with their debut studio album ''Caravelle'' with the track "Cœur Croisé" released as a single with an accompanying music video. The album was a critical success with Julien Baldacchino of [[France Inter]] and by the site [[Les Inrocks]], amongst many. In July 2018, a deluxe edition of the same album was released and in October the same year the EP ''Mexicali'' and a tour to promote the album and EP from September to December 2018. The album was certified gold in 2018, alongside a gold certified single "Nanã". The follow-up EP ''Gengis'' had remixing tracks. In 2020, the single "Feel Good" was released followed by a same-titled EP.

June 2021 saw their biggest success, the album ''Cyclorama'' carrying the single "[[Ani Couni Chaouani#Polo & Pan version|Ani Kuni]]" based on a traditional song "[[Ani Couni Chaouani]]", a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] hymn originating from the [[Arapaho]] tribes living on the plains of Colorado and Wyoming in the United States. "Ani Kuni" became Polo & Pan's biggest hit rising to number 10 on the French [[SNEP]] Singles Chart, also charting in Belgium's [[Ultratop]] Wallonia chart.
