'''Fuzz''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States, formed in 2011. The band consists of [[Charles Moothart]] (vocals, guitar), [[Ty Segall]] (vocals, drums) and [[Chad Ubovich]] (vocals, bass)

Created as an outlet for Moothart's affection for [[hard rock]] [[riff]]s, Fuzz began as collaboration between Moothart and Segall, while Moothart performed in Segall's live band. In 2012, the pair released two singles, "This Time I Got a Reason" and "Sleigh Ride", and were joined by bass guitarist Roland Cosio.<ref name="intheredrecords.com">{{Cite web|url=https://intheredrecords.com/collections/fuzz|title=Fuzz|website=In the Red Records}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Artists - Fuzz|url=http://www.troubleinmindrecs.com/artists/fuzz/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119000055/http://www.troubleinmindrecs.com/artists/fuzz/|archive-date=2015-11-19|access-date=2015-10-24|website=Trouble In Mind Records}}</ref>

==History==
===Beginnings (2013)===
Regarding the band's origins, vocalist and guitarist [[Charles Moothart]] noted that the project began at his home: "I was sitting in my house one day, before I was in [[Ty Segall|Ty]]'s band or anything, wondering how hard it would be to write a [[hard rock]] song. I was trying to figure out if it'd be ridiculous, or sound like shit. I just tried and then eventually showed the stuff to Ty. He was stoked on it and then we tried to jam together. It was really more to have fun. He mentioned playing drums. We wanted to play music like that, just to see if it was possible."<ref name="InterviewMag">{{cite web|last=Joyce|first=Colin|date=2013-10-02|title=The Logic of Fuzz|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/fuzz-charles-moothart-ty-segall/#_|accessdate=18 November 2015|work=Interview Magazine}}</ref>

The band's first, self-titled album was released in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Minsker|first=Evan|date=2020-09-13|title=Fuzz: Fuzz|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18570-fuzz-fuzz/|access-date=2020-08-08|website=Pitchfork|language=en}}</ref>

===Addition of Chad Ubovich and ''II'' (2015)===
Upon joining the band, bass guitarist [[Chad Ubovich]] noted that the writing process for ''II'' differed from their previous collaborations and projects with one another: “We all kind of did something we’ve never done before, which was write together as a band. That was a first for all of us. Usually in our respective projects it’s all about writing on our own, and that process. This time we tried something definitely new."<ref name="laweekly"/> Still in Rock tied the album with Mac Demarco's Another One for the 3rd best album of 2015.<ref>[http://www.stillinrock.com/2015/12/best-of-2015-best-lps-20-to-1.html Best LPs of 2015 – Top 20] “Still in Rock”</ref>
