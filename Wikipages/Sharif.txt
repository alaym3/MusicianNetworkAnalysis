'''Sharīf''' ({{lang-ar|شريف}}, 'noble', 'highborn'), also spelled '''shareef''' or '''sherif''', feminine '''sharīfa''' ({{lang|ar|شريفة}}), plural '''ashrāf''' ({{lang|ar|أشراف}}), '''shurafāʾ''' ({{lang|ar|شرفاء}}), or (in the [[Maghreb]]) '''shurfāʾ''', is a term used to designate a person descended, or claiming to be descended, from the family of the prophet [[Muhammad]] ({{circa|570 CE –}} {{nowrap|632 CE}}). It may be used in three senses:

#In the broadest sense, it refers to any descendant of Muhammad's great-grandfather [[Hashim ibn Abd Manaf|Hashim]] (the [[Banu Hashim]] or Hashimites, already in Muhammad's day an established clan within the Meccan tribe of the [[Quraysh]]), including all descendants of Muhammad's paternal uncles [[Abu Talib ibn Abd al-Muttalib|Abu Talib]] (the [[Talibids]]) and [[Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib|al-Abbas]] (the [[Abbasids]]).<ref name="EI2Sharif">{{harvnb|Van Arendonk|Graham|1960–2007}}.</ref>
#More often, it refers to a descendant of [[Ali]], a son of Abu Talib and a paternal cousin of Muhammad (the [[Alids]]), especially but not exclusively through Ali's marriage with the prophet Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah|Fatima]] (the [[Fatimids]]). In this latter (and most commonly used) sense, the term effectively refers to all descendants of the prophet.<ref name="EI2Sharif"/>
#In its most narrow sense, it refers only to someone who descends from Ali and Fatima's eldest son (and Muhammad's grandson) [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] (the [[Hasanids]]). In this limited context, it is contrasted with the term {{transl|ar|sayyid}} ('lord', 'master', plural {{transl|ar|sāda}}, ({{lang|ar|سادة}}), which then only refers to the descendants of Hasan's younger brother [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] (the [[Husaynids]]).<ref name="EI2Sharif"/>

Precise usage of the term has varied both historically and geographically. Today, descent from the prophet through his daughter Fatima (either Hasanid or Husaynid) is more commonly designated by the term {{transl|ar|[[sayyid]]}}.<ref name="EI2Sharif"/>

==Etymology==

The word derives from the [[Arabic root]] sh–r–f, which expresses meanings related to honor, nobility, and prominence.<ref name="EI2Sharif"/> It has no etymological connection with the English term ''[[sheriff]]'', which comes from the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''scīrgerefa'', meaning "shire-reeve", the local [[Reeve (England)|reeve]] (enforcement agent) of the king in the [[shire]] (county).<ref>{{harvnb|Online Etymology Dictionary|2001–2021}}.</ref>

==Usage==

Precise usage of the term has varied both historically and geographically. Often, the terms {{transl|ar|sharīf}} and {{transl|ar|[[sayyid]]}} were used interchangeably, while in other contexts they referred to [[Hasanid]] vs. [[Husaynid]] descent (especially in the [[Hejaz]], where the [[Sharifate of Mecca]] was restricted to persons of Hasanid descent). In still other contexts, they both referred to some form of [[Banu Hashim|Hashimite]] descent, but were linked to a different and specific social status.<ref name="EI2Sharif"/>

In most places the term has functioned as a mark of nobility (both the [[Abbasids]] and the [[Fatimids]] were at one time holder of the [[caliphate]]), except in [[South Asia]], where the meaning of the term has expanded to include all Muslims of foreign descent. Thus, in the [[caste system among South Asian Muslims]], the term {{transl|ar|ashrāf}} designates not only Muslims of Arab descent ({{transl|ar|sayyid}}s or purported descendants of Ali and Fatima, and {{transl|ar|[[Shaikhs in South Asia|shaykh]]}}s, which include all those who claim descent from the [[Quraysh]] or from one of Muhammad's [[sahaba|companions]]), but also Muslims of Pasthun ([[Pathans]]) or Turko-Mongol ([[Mughal people|Mughals]]) descent.<ref name="EI2Sharif"/>

Over time, people who were not of Hashimite descent were sometimes also granted the title {{transl|ar|sharīf}} as a general mark of nobility. The result of this has been that the term {{transl|ar|sayyid}} has become a more common designation for those claiming descent from the prophet today.<ref name="EI2Sharif"/> As such, {{transl|ar|Sayyid}} (or one of its many alternative spellings, like {{transl|ar|Sayyed}} or {{transl|ar|Syed}}) has also become a common [[Sayyid (name)|proper name]].
