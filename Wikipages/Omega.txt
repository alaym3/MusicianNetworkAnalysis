{{Greek Alphabet|letter=omega}}
'''Omega''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|oʊ|m|ɪ|ɡ|ə|,_|oʊ|ˈ|m|iː|ɡ|ə|,_|oʊ|ˈ|m|ɛ|ɡ|ə|,_|oʊ|ˈ|m|eɪ|ɡ|ə}};<ref>{{OED|omega}}</ref><ref>https://www.dictionary.com/browse/omega</ref> [[capital letter|capital]]: '''Ω''', [[lower case|lowercase]]: '''ω'''; [[Ancient Greek]] ὦ, later ὦ μέγα, [[Modern Greek]] ωμέγα) is the 24th and last letter in the [[Greek alphabet]]. In the [[Greek numerals|Greek numeric system]]/[[isopsephy]] ([[gematria]]), it has a value of 800. The word literally means "great&nbsp;O" (''ō mega'', mega meaning "great"), as opposed to [[omicron]], which means "little&nbsp;O" (''o mikron'', micron meaning "little").<ref>[http://www.quinapalus.com/gr0.1.html The Greek Alphabet]</ref>

In [[Phonetics|phonetic]] terms, the Ancient Greek Ω is a [[vowel length|long]] [[open-mid back rounded vowel|open-mid ''o'']] {{IPA|[ɔː]}}, comparable to the vowel of [[English language|English]] ''raw''{{Clarify|date=November 2021}}. In [[Modern Greek]], Ω represents the [[mid<!-- not close-mid, see Arvanti (1999) - Illustrations of the IPA: Modern Greek. --> back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|/o̞/, the same sound as [[omicron]]. The letter omega is [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribed]] ''ō'' or simply ''o''.

As the final letter in the Greek alphabet, omega is often used to denote the last, the end, or the ultimate limit of a [[set theory|set]], in contrast to [[Alpha (letter)|alpha]], the first letter of the Greek alphabet; see [[Alpha and Omega]].

==History==
Ω was not part of the early (8th century BC) [[Archaic Greek alphabets|Greek alphabets]]. It was introduced in the late 7th century BC in the Ionian cities of Asia Minor to denote a [[vowel length|long]] [[open-mid back rounded vowel]] {{IPA|[ɔː]}}. It is a variant of omicron (Ο), broken up at the side ([[File:Greek Omega 09.svg|x16px]]), with the edges subsequently turned outward ({{GrGl|Omega 09}}, {{GrGl|Omega 05}}, {{GrGl|Omega 03}}, {{GrGl|Omega 07}}).<ref name=Jeffery37f>Anne Jeffery (1961), ''The local scripts of archaic Greece'', p.37–38.</ref>
The Dorian city of [[Knidos]] as well as a few Aegean islands, namely [[Paros]], [[Thasos]] and [[Melos]], chose the exact opposite innovation, using a broken-up circle for the short and a closed circle for the long {{IPA|/o/}}.<ref name=Jeffery37f/>

The name Ωμέγα is [[Medieval Greek|Byzantine]]; in [[Ancient Greek|Classical Greek]], the letter was called ''ō'' ({{lang|grc|ὦ}}), whereas the omicron was called ''ou'' ({{lang|grc|οὖ}}).<ref>Herbert Weir Smyth. ''A Greek Grammar for Colleges''. §1</ref> 
The modern lowercase shape goes back to the [[uncial]] form [[File:Greek uncial Omega.svg|x14px]], a form that developed during the 3rd century BC in ancient handwriting on papyrus, from a flattened-out form of the letter ([[File:Greek Omega 08.svg|x16px]]) that had its edges curved even further upward.<ref>Edward M. Thompson (1912), ''Introduction to Greek and Latin paleography'', Oxford: Clarendon. p.144</ref>

In addition to the Greek alphabet, Omega was also adopted into the [[early Cyrillic alphabet]]. See [[omega (Cyrillic)|Cyrillic omega]] (Ѡ, ѡ). A [[Raetic alphabet|Raetic]] variant is conjectured to be at the origin or parallel evolution of the [[Elder Futhark]] [[ᛟ]].

Omega was also adopted into the Latin alphabet, as a letter of the 1982 revision to the [[African reference alphabet]]. It has had little use. See [[Latin omega]].

== The symbol Ω (uppercase letter) ==
