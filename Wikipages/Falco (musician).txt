'''Johann''' "'''Hans'''" '''Hölzel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈjoːhan ˈhœlt͡sl̩|lang}}; 19 February 1957 – 6 February 1998), better known by his stage name '''Falco''', was an Austrian musician, singer and composer.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|title=Falco|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/449913/Falco/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910215724/http://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/449913/Falco/overview|url-status=dead|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]]|author=Cammila Collar|date=2014|archive-date=2014-09-10}}</ref>

Falco had several international hits including "[[Rock Me Amadeus]]",<ref name=NYT/> "[[Der Kommissar (song)|Der Kommissar]]", "[[Vienna Calling]]",<ref name=NYT/> "[[Jeanny (song)|Jeanny]]", "[[The Sound of Musik]]", "[[Coming Home (Jeanny Part II, One Year Later)]]", and posthumously "[[Out of the Dark (song)|Out of the Dark]]". "Rock Me Amadeus" reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in 1986, making him the only artist whose principal language was German to score a vocal number-one hit in the United States ([[Bert Kaempfert]] reached No. 1 in January 1961 with the instrumental "[[Wonderland by Night]]"). According to his estate, he has sold 20 million albums and 40 million singles, which makes him the best-selling Austrian singer of all time.

==Early years==
Johann Hölzel was born on 19 February 1957 to Alois Hölzel and Maria Hölzel in a [[working class]] district of [[Vienna]]. Maria would later recall that she had been pregnant with triplets. As it was a [[Multiple birth#Triplets|dizygotic pregnancy]], she [[Miscarriage|miscarried]] the [[identical twins]] during the third month and Falco, who was conceived via a separate ovum, survived. Falco mused that "three souls in one breast sounds a little over-dramatic, but I do sense them sometimes. In my moodiness. I'll be really up and then right after I'll be really down."<ref name="Too Young to Die">{{Cite episode |title=Falco |series=Too Young to Die |network=Arte |date=November 2015 |season=1 |number=9 |language=en, de, fr}}</ref><ref name="Mutter von Falco gestorben">{{cite web |url=http://www.nachrichten.at/nachrichten/society/Mutter-von-Falco-gestorben;art411,1360169 |title=Mutter von Falco gestorben |date=15 April 2014 |website=Nachrichten|access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref>

In 1963, Falco began his schooling at a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] private school; four years later, at age ten, he switched to the [[Education in Austria|Rainergymnasium]] in [[Margareten]].{{citation needed| date= December 2013}} Falco's father left the family while he was still a child, and he was raised by his mother.<ref name="Too Young to Die" />

Falco began to show signs of unusual musical talent very early. As a toddler, he was able to keep time with the drumbeat in songs he heard on the radio. He was given a child's [[grand piano]] for his fourth birthday; a year later, his birthday gift was a record player which he used to play music by [[Elvis Presley]], [[Cliff Richard]], and [[the Beatles]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

Falco wanted to be a [[pop star]] from a very early age.<ref name="Too Young to Die" /> At age 16, he attended the [[Music and Arts University of the City of Vienna|Vienna Conservatoire]], but he  became frustrated and soon left.<ref name="Obituary: Falco">{{cite web |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-falco-1144136.html |title=Obituary: Falco |last1= Perrone |first1=Pierre |date=10 February 1998 |website= The Independent |access-date= 4 November 2016}}</ref> His mother insisted he begin an [[apprenticeship]] with the Austrian employee pension insurance institute. This too only lasted a short time. At seventeen, he got conscripted for eight months of military service with the Austrian army.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In late 1970s Vienna, he became part of the Viennese nightlife, which included not just music but also [[striptease]], [[performance art]] and a general atmosphere of [[Political satire|satirizing politics]] and celebrating chaos. He played [[bass guitar]] in a number of bands under various pseudonyms, including "John Hudson" and "John DiFalco." One such band with whom he appeared was [[Stefan Weber (musician)|Drahdiwaberl]], an Austrian group that employed shock tactics and stage antics. It was around this time he began performing under the stage name of Falco. Despite being closely tied with the Viennese underground club scene, Falco looked uncharacteristically clean-cut. In contrast to shabbier fashions, he had short hair (due to his military service) and wore [[Ray-Ban Wayfarer|Ray-Ban]] sunglasses and suits. His distinct style, coupled with his singing performance of the song "[[Ganz Wien]]" ("All of Vienna") led to manager Markus Spiegel offering to sign Falco in 1981. Ironically, it was at a concert for drug prevention and "Ganz Wien" has a line proclaiming "All Vienna is on [[heroin]] today."<ref name="Too Young to Die" /><ref name="Obituary: Falco" />

== Individual success ==

Once Falco was signed as a solo artist, he continued composing his own music and hired songwriter [[Robert Ponger]]. In 1981 Falco brought his intended first single "Helden von heute" to manager Horst Bork, but received a lukewarm reception. Bork felt that the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] "[[Der Kommissar (song)|Der Kommissar]]" was much stronger. Falco was hesitant, since the track is a German-language song about drug consumption that combines rap verses with a sung chorus. Though beginning to break through in America, rap was still rare in Western Europe at the time. Bork insisted and the song became a number-one success in Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Japan, while charting high in several other nations.<ref name="Too Young to Die" />

[[File:Falco Ursela Monn 1986-3.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Falco and actress [[Ursela Monn]] (1986)]]
Though "Der Kommissar" failed to break through in the UK and US, the British rock band [[After the Fire]] [[Der Kommissar (song)#Cover versions and tributes|covered the song]] with new English lyrics. This version charted at number five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in the U.S.<ref name="Too Young to Die" /> That same year, American singer [[Laura Branigan]] recorded a non-single version of the song with new English lyrics under the title "Deep in the Dark" on her album ''[[Branigan 2]]''. ''[[Einzelhaft]]'', the album on which "Der Kommissar" appears, also topped the charts in Austria and the Netherlands.

Falco and Ponger returned to the studio in 1983 to record Falco's second album ''[[Junge Roemer]]'' ("Young Romans"). It was a difficult project, as the two artists felt immense pressure to match their previous success and the recording process was plagued by delays. ''Junge Roemer'' was released in 1984. Even though the music video for the single "Hoch wie nie" ("Higher Than Ever") was aired on prime time TV in Austria, it failed to ignite interest internationally.<ref name="Too Young to Die" /><ref name="Falco - Hoch Wie Nie">{{cite web |url= http://www.austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Falco&titel=Hoch+wie+nie&cat=s |title=Falco - Hoch Wie Nie |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=1984 |website=austriancahrts.at |publisher= Ausstrian Charts |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref>

''Junge Roemer'' only charted in Austria where it went to number one. Outside of Austria and Spain, the title track and main single "Junge Roemer" failed to repeat the success of "Der Kommissar". As a reaction, Falco began to experiment with English lyrics in an effort to broaden his appeal.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} He parted ways with Ponger and chose a new production team: the brothers [[Bolland & Bolland|Rob and Ferdi Bolland]] from the Netherlands.<ref name="Too Young to Die" />

Falco recorded "[[Rock Me Amadeus]]" inspired in part by the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[Amadeus (film)|Amadeus]]'', and the song became a worldwide hit in 1986. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in over a dozen countries, including the US, UK, and Japan, bringing the success that had eluded him in markets a few years earlier. The song remained in the top spot of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for three weeks. His album ''[[Falco 3]]'' peaked at the number three position on the'' Billboard'' album charts. Unusually for a white act, especially one from mainland Europe, "Rock Me Amadeus" reached number six in the Billboard Top R&B Singles Chart, and ''Falco 3'' peaked at number 18 on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts. Follow-up single "Vienna Calling" was another international pop hit, peaking at No.&nbsp;18 of the Billboard Charts and No.&nbsp;17 on the US [[Cash Box]] Charts in 1986. A double A-side 12" single featuring remixes of those two hits peaked at No.&nbsp;4 on the US Dance/Disco charts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

"[[Jeanny (song)|Jeanny]]", the third release from the album ''Falco 3'', brought the performer back to the top of the charts across Europe. Highly controversial when it was released in Germany and the Netherlands, the story of "Jeanny" was told from the point of view of a possible rapist and murderer. Several DJs and radio stations refused to play the ballad, which was ignored in the US, though it became a huge hit in many European countries, and inspired a sequel on his next album.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

After the success of "Rock Me Amadeus," there were talks of crossing over more permanently into the U.S. by working with American producers and collaborating with other American artists. These possibilities fell through, in part, due to Falco's personal problems. At this point in his career, he was dangerously addicted to alcohol and other drugs.<ref name="Too Young to Die" />

In 1986, the album ''[[Emotional (Falco album)|Emotional]]'' was released, produced by Rob and Ferdi Bolland ([[Bolland & Bolland]]). Songs on the album included "[[Coming Home (Jeanny Part II, One Year Later)]]", "The Kiss of [[Kathleen Turner]]", and "Kamikaze Capa" which was written as a tribute to the late photojournalist [[Robert Capa]]. "The Sound of Musik" was another international success, and a Top 20 US dance hit, though it failed to make the US pop charts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 1987, Falco went on the ''Emotional'' world tour ending in Japan.  In the same year he sang a duet with [[Brigitte Nielsen]], "[[Body Next to Body]]"; the single was a Top 10 hit in [[Germanosphere|German-speaking]] countries. The album ''[[Wiener Blut (album)|Wiener Blut]]'' ("Viennese Blood") was released in 1988 but it did not get much publicity outside Germany and Austria.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

After 1986, there were a number of European hits, but Falco was rarely heard in the US and the UK. His 1992 comeback attempt, the album ''[[Nachtflug]]'' ("Night Flight") including the song "[[Titanic (Falco song)|Titanic]]", was successful in Austria only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Falco&titel=Nachtflug&cat=a|title=Falco - Nachtflug|first=Steffen|last=Hung}}</ref>

Starting in the early 1990s, Falco lived in the Dominican Republic, where he worked on his last album from 1995 to 1998. ''[[Out of the Dark (Into the Light)]]'' was released posthumously on 27 February 1998 in Europe and worldwide in March. It charted at number one in Austria for 21 weeks.<ref name="Too Young to Die" /><ref name="Falco – Out Of The Dark (Into The Light)">{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Falco-Out-Of-The-Dark-Into-The-Light/master/282446 |title=Falco – Out Of The Dark (Into The Light) |website=Discogs |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="Falco - Out Of The Dark (Into The Light) Austrian Charts">{{cite web |url=http://austriancharts.at/showitem.asp?interpret=Falco&titel=Out+Of+The+Dark+%28Into+The+Light%29&cat=a |title=Falco - Out Of The Dark (Into The Light) Austrian Charts |website=Austrian Charts |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Falco has been described by those who knew him as having a complex personality. He has been called ambitious, eccentric, caring, egotistical and deeply insecure. Thomas Rabitsch, a keyboardist who met Falco when the aspiring pop star was only 17 years old, said he was a quiet young man and precise bass player, but also arrogant and with a "very high opinion of himself." Markus Spiegel, the manager who discovered Falco, admitted that the pop star was "an extremely difficult artist" and known womanizer. Peter Vieweger, a guitarist who knew Falco before his success and continued to play in Falco's touring band and on his albums, remembers Falco as being "scared he would fail or be unmasked and not be as good as people thought he was."<ref name="Too Young to Die" /><ref name="Zwischen Komplexen und Größenwahn">{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/15-jahre-nach-falcos-tod-zwischen-komplexen-und-groessenwahn/7740008.html |title=Zwischen Komplexen und Größenwahn |last=Drutschmann |first=Dominik |date=6 February 2013 |website=Der Tagesspiegel|access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref>

Through the 1980s and into the '90s, he became dependent on alcohol and cocaine. When under the influence he was unreliable at best and abusive at worst. [[Bolland & Bolland|Ferdi Bolland]] recalls that Falco was often so severely intoxicated that the writing process revolved around his "inability to be coherent, to even stand for a long time." Despite pleas from his manager and collaborators to get help, Falco stubbornly refused.<ref name="Too Young to Die" /><ref name="Zwischen Komplexen und Größenwahn"/>

While Falco was in a relationship with Isabella Vitkovic, she gave birth to a baby girl, Katharina, in 1986. The couple married in 1988, but it was a "love-hate" relationship, as Katharina describes it, and the marriage was short-lived. He believed that Katharina was his own daughter until a [[DNA paternity testing|paternity test]] proved otherwise when she was seven years old. After this, Katharina's relationship with him became strained. Though they kept in contact, she took her mother's surname and claimed that she was written out of his will. She was 12 years old when he died. She did not reconcile with Falco's mother, Maria Hölzel, until a few years before Hölzel's death at the age of 87 in April 2014. Katharina subsequently published a memoir in 2008 called ''Falco war mein Vater'' (Falco Was My Father).<ref name="Too Young to Die" /><ref name="Mutter von Falco gestorben" /><ref name="Falco was my father">{{cite web |url=http://www.thelocal.de/20080128/10211 |title=Falco Was My Father |date=28 January 2008 | website=The Local |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="Falco war mein Vater">{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18224527-falco-war-mein-vater |title=Falco war mein Vater |date=January 2008 |website=Good Reads |publisher=Ueberreuter |access-date=4 November 2016}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Falco Grab.jpg|thumb|upright|Falco's grave at [[Vienna Central Cemetery]]]]
Falco died of severe injuries received on 6 February 1998, 13 days before his 41st birthday, when his [[Mitsubishi Pajero]] collided with a bus on the road linking the towns of [[Villa Montellano]] and [[Puerto Plata (city)|Puerto Plata]] in the Dominican Republic.<ref>[http://www.ots.at/presseaussendung/OTS_19980318_OTS0177/falcos-obduktionsbericht-notariell-beglaubigt-ult-vorausmeldung-zu-news-1219398], press release containing the coroner's statement (in German), accessed Dec 12, 2014</ref> At the time of his death he was planning a comeback, which was successful with the posthumously released album ''[[Out of the Dark (Into the Light)]]''. His body was returned to Austria and buried at the [[Vienna Central Cemetery]].<ref name=friedhof>[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/3156 Falco], Findagrave.com</ref>

==Tributes==
[[file:Falco-Statue-02.jpg|thumb|upright|A Falco statue in [[Gars am Kamp]], Lower Austria]]
In 1998, [[Bolland & Bolland|Rob and Ferdi Bolland]] (Dutch producers and co-writers of about half of Falco's albums) released the EP ''Tribute to Falco'' under the name The Bolland Project feat. Alida. The title track featured samples of Falco's music; the other tracks were "We Say Goodbye" and "So Lonely".

The film ''[[Falco: Damn It, We're Still Alive!]]'' was released in Austria on 7 February 2008, ten years and one day after Falco's death.  This title also lends its name to a posthumously-released album by Falco, ''[[Verdammt wir leben noch]],'' which translates to "Damn, we're still alive!"  Written and directed by Thomas Roth, the movie features musician Manuel Rubey as adult Falco.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0915457/|title=Falco - Verdammt, wir leben noch! (2008)|author=OJT|date=7 February 2008|work=IMDb|access-date=7 January 2016}}</ref>  The end credits include the line "With love, Ferdi & Rob", his frequent collaborators the Bollands.

Falco's friend [[Niki Lauda]] named one of the Boeing airplanes in his [[Lauda Air]] fleet "Falco" after the singer.<ref name=lauda>{{cite web|url=http://www.laudaair.com/site/index.php?id=105&L=1|title=Austrian myHoliday|access-date=7 January 2016}}</ref>

Although "[[Der Kommissar (song)|Der Kommissar]]" saw nearly contemporaneous and fairly straightforward mainstream covers including the loose translation by [[After the Fire]] and the reinterpretation by Suzy Andrews, both in 1982 and 1983, Falco's song "[[Rock Me Amadeus]]" has seen more frequent use. [[Megaherz]] covered this song on their album ''[[Kopfschuss]]''. The track has been sampled by groups including the [[Bloodhound Gang]], who also refer to Falco in their 1999 song "[[Mope]]", and by German rapper [[Fler]] in "NDW 2005" from ''[[Neue Deutsche Welle (album)|Neue Deutsche Welle]]''.

The restaurant Marchfelderhof in a Vienna suburb maintains a permanent reserved table for Falco.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marchfelderhof.at/|title=Marchfelderhof - bei uns ist jeder Gast Kaiser!|work=Marchfelderhof|access-date=7 January 2016}}</ref>

The 1999 film ''[[Sugar Town (film)|Sugar Town]]'' is dedicated to Falco.
