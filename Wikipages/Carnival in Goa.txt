Though significantly smaller than the well-known [[Rio Carnival]] or the Portuguese [[Carnival of Madeira]], the Goa Carnival is the largest in [[India]] and one of the few traditional celebrations of the [[Western Christian]] holiday in Asia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/goa-carnival-kicks-off/article17368366.ece|title=Goa carnival kicks off|last=Kamat|first=Prakash|date=2017-02-25|work=The Hindu|access-date=2019-08-24|language=en-IN|issn=0971-751X}}</ref> Despite falling into obscurity during the latter days of the Portuguese colonial rule of Goa, the Goa Carnival was resurrected as a minor street celebration in 1965 and has since turned into a major tourist attraction for the small state.<ref name="Oheraldo" />

== Origin ==
While the roots of the Carnival in Goa date back to the introduction of [[Roman Catholic]] traditions during the [[Portuguese conquest of Goa]], the festival itself fell into obscurity during the later days of colonialism, as Portugal's authoritarian regime known and is celebrated on the same day as Portugal [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] limited freedom of assembly and press.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/320476448_Dictatorship_liberation_transition_in_the_short_fiction_of_three_Portuguese-language_Goan_writers_Alberto_de_Menezes_Rodrigues_Ananta_Rau_Sar_Dessai_and_Telo_de_Mascarenhas|title=Dictatorship, liberation, transition in the short fiction of three Portuguese-language Goan writers: Alberto de Menezes Rodrigues, Ananta Rau Sar Dessai and Telo de Mascarenhas|website=researchgate.net|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>

After the end of Portuguese rule, the Brazilian version of the festival was imposed by Timoteo Fernandes in 1965, a Goan musician who modeled it after the famed Rio Carnival. This was done to attract more tourism.<ref name="Oheraldo" />  Today, the urban parade includes floats from local villages, commercial entities, and cultural groups. It is still organised in a very traditional manner, including by the staging of streetside local plays, in the coastal ''[[taluka]]'' of [[Salcete]]. According to the [[Government of Goa]]'s Department of Tourism, the carnival is "Goa's most famous festival and has been celebrated since the 18th century."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goatourism.gov.in/festivals/other-celebrations/208-carnival|title=Carnival|website=goatourism.gov.in|publisher=Goa Tourism|accessdate=13 March 2017|archive-date=9 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170209150950/http://www.goatourism.gov.in/festivals/other-celebrations/208-carnival|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Carnival usually starts off on Fat Saturday (known as {{Lang|pt|Sabado Gordo}}) and concludes on Fat Tuesday (known as Shrove Tuesday), just before [[Ash Wednesday]] and the first day of the Catholic season of [[Lent]].  In [[Panjim]], the capital of Goa, the festival is complemented by Grape Escapade, a local wine festival, and a dance at Samba Square in the centrally-located Garden of Garcia da Orta.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/Red-and-black-dance-at-Samba-Square/articleshow/31364910.cms|title=Times of India - Red and Black Dance at Samba Square|website=timesofindia.indiatimes.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>

According to local tradition, during Carnival Goa is taken over by [[King Momo]], usually a local resident who presides over the festival during the four-day span.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2011/03/04/goa-ready-for-king-momo-and-carnival/|title=The Wall Street Journal - Goa Ready for King Momo and Carnival|website=wsj.com|language=en|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>  King Momo traditionally proclaims the [[Konkani]] message {{Transl|gom|Kha, piye aani majja kar}} (English: “Eat, drink and make merry”). In 2021 the King Momo for the Goa Carnival was Mr. Sixtus Eric Dias from Candolim.

== Parade ==
The parade usually begins on Fat Saturday evening with a procession headed by [[King Momo]]. In 2021 the King Momo for the Goa Carnival was Mr. Sixtus Eric Dias from Candolim. Balloons, horse-drawn carriages, decorated bullock carts and elaborate floats are the highlights of the parade. The festivities during Goa Carnival include dancing troupes, revelers wearing masks and costumes, live music, sports competitions, floats and parades, and food and drinking.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tourism-of-india.com/events-festival/carnival-in-goa.html|title=Goa Carnival 2018 {{!}} Festival in Goa|website=www.tourism-of-india.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-02-12}}</ref>
