'''The Faceless''' are an American [[technical death metal]] band from the [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] neighborhood of [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. They released their debut album, ''[[Akeldama (album)|Akeldama]]'', in November 2006, and a follow-up, ''[[Planetary Duality]]'', in November 2008. The band's third album, ''[[Autotheism (album)|Autotheism]]'', was released on August 14, 2012. On December 1, 2017, the band released their fourth album, ''[[In Becoming a Ghost]]''. It was their first album in over five years.

== History ==
The band was formed in [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino]] by guitarist Michael Keene and bassist Brandon Giffin in 2004. In the winter of 2005, the band began work on a four-song [[extended play|extended-play]] album which would become ''Akeldama''. After recording the drum tracks, drummer Brett Batdorf left the band. After a break in the recording process, the band decided to make the EP into a full–length record and recruited several drummers to finish the drum tracks for the remaining songs.

Following the release of ''Akeldama'', the band toured extensively with bands including [[Necrophagist]], [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]], [[Nile (band)|Nile]], and [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]].<ref> [http://metalinjection.net/reviews/all-shall-perish-arsis-and-the-faceless-metal-maniacs-tour-show-review All Shall Perish, Arsis, and The Faceless Metal Maniacs Tour Show Review]. Metal Injection.  Retrieved February 1, 2013.</ref> The band went through several fill-in drummers before adding drummer Lyle Cooper to their line-up.

''Planetary Duality'' débuted at number{{nbsp}}119 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=109201|title=The Faceless: 'Planetary Duality' First-Week Sales Revealed – Nov. 19, 2008|date=n.d.|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=February 1, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213081840/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=109201|archive-date=February 13, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The album was critically acclaimed and brought the band a new level of success.

Soon after its release, they toured with bands including [[Meshuggah]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] and [[In Flames]]. Prior to their performance at California Metalfest IV, Giffin announced that he would no longer be in the band.<ref>{{cite web| date = May 14, 2010 | url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=14490&ref=lph|title=The Faceless Bass Player Quits Group| website=Lambgoat.com | access-date= February 1, 2013}}</ref> The band also announced that they would be playing in [[The Summer Slaughter Tour]] of 2010 along with bands including [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]], [[All Shall Perish]], and [[Decrepit Birth]].

In May 2011, Keene confirmed via [[Facebook]] that Geoffrey Ficco would be replacing Derek Rydquist as the band’s vocalist.<ref>{{cite web| date = May 20, 2010 | url=https://www.facebook.com/thefaceless/posts/10150179906531074&ref=1ph|title= ''<nowiki>[untitled]</nowiki>| publisher = The Faceless (via their [[Facebook]] module) | access-date= February 1, 2013 | quote = “So, as some of you may have heard, Derek is no longer in The Faceless. We wish him the best of luck and will always value the time he spent in our band. Our new vocalist’s name is Geoffrey Ficco and he is truly a beast! If you’ve heard our demo for ‘The Eidolon Reality’ than you’ve already heard his punishing vocals ;) Surprise!” –  Keene}}</ref> Ficco performed the lead vocals on “The Eidolon Reality” pre-production preview track released on [[YouTube]]. In April 2011, the band was joined by bassist [[Evan Brewer]] of [[Animosity (band)|Animosity]], replacing Giffin.<ref>  [http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=156501 “The Faceless Announces New Bassist] April 7, 2011. [[Blabbermouth.net]]. Retrieved February 1, 2013.</ref>

In March 2012, guitarist Steve Jones left the band and was replaced by Wes Hauch, leaving Keene as the last founding member still in the band. Keene stated that “he’s moved in a different direction than us and we wish him good luck in his ventures.” Keene has also stated{{when|date=February 2013}} that the addition of Hauch gave the band some fresh energy, praising Hauch to be “one of the finest guitar players I’ve ever had the privilege of playing with, he’s really amazing.” Keene wrote Autotheism almost entirely while being the only member of the band, with the exception of track "Ten Billion Years" which was brought to the table by Wes Hauch and rewritten together between Hauch and Keene, keeping a large portion of Hauch's original arrangement with some Faceless signature elements added.
 
''Autotheism'' débuted at number{{nbsp}}50 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and hit number{{nbsp}}1 on [[CMJ]] radio loud rock charts.

The band, along with bands including [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]], took part in [[The Summer Slaughter Tour]] of 2012.

In January 2013, Cooper left the band, and posted on his Facebook module regarding his departure; he claimed that the band’s goals and interests were not his own.<ref>{{better source|date=January 2013}} {{registration required|date=January 2013}} {{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/lylelcooper/posts/10151249246687849|title=Lyle Cooper Leaving The Faceless| publisher = Lyle Cooper (via his [[Facebook]] module) | access-date= January 26, 2013}}</ref> [[Alex Rüdinger]], formerly of The HAARP Machine, a labelmate of The Faceless, became the band’s new full-time drummer.<ref>{{cite web| date = January 28, 2013 | url=https://www.facebook.com/thefaceless/posts/562769460401617|title= ''<nowiki>[untitled]</nowiki> | publisher = The Faceless (via their [[Facebook]] module) |access-date= February 1, 2013 | quote = To clear the air on a few details, The Faceless has decided to part ways with drummer Lyle Cooper due to a growing difference in the level of commitment to the project.

Having said that, we are very excited to announce that Alex Rudinger is our new full time drummer. We just played our first 3 shows with him in Mexico and what he brings to the band both musically and personally, is simply astounding. We are looking forward to a great future with Alex.}} The Faceless was design by Juan Franco Art in 2007</ref>
