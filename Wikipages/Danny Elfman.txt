After returning to Los Angeles from Africa in the early 1970s, Elfman was asked by his brother [[Richard Elfman|Richard]] to serve as musical director of his [[street theatre]] performance art troupe [[The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo]].<ref name="bond2015"/>{{rp|22}}

Elfman was tasked with adapting and arranging 1920s and 1930s [[jazz]] and [[big band]] music by artists such as [[Cab Calloway]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Django Reinhardt]] and [[Josephine Baker]] for the ensemble, which consisted of up to 15 performers playing upwards of 30 instruments.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/loopandreplay/mystic-knights-oingo-boingo-49f5170166a9 |title=The Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo: Danny Elfman's Circus Theater Origins |last=Benson |first=Alex |date=May 15, 2018 |website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] |access-date=October 13, 2019 }}</ref> He also composed original pieces and helped build instruments unique for the group, including an aluminum [[gamelan]], the 'Schlitz [[celesta|celeste]]' made from tuned beer cans, and a "junkyard orchestra" built from car parts and trash cans.<ref name=halfyard2004>{{cite book |last=Halfyard |first=Janet K. |date=September 7, 2004 |title=Danny Elfman's Batman: A Film Score Guide |url=https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780810851269/Danny-Elfman's-Batman-A-Film-Score-Guide |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] |isbn=978-0810851269 }}</ref>

The Mystic Knights performed on the street and in [[nightclub]]s throughout Los Angeles until Richard left in 1979 to pursue filmmaking.<ref name="bond2015" />{{rp|15}} As a send-off to the group's original concept, Richard created the film ''[[Forbidden Zone]]'' based on the Mystic Knights' stage performances.

Following ''Pee Wee's Big Adventure'', Elfman scored mainly quirky comedies in the late 1980s, including ''[[Back to School]]'' starring [[Rodney Dangerfield]], Burton's ''[[Beetlejuice]]'' and the [[Bill Murray]] vehicle ''[[Scrooged]]''.

In 1989, Elfman's influential, [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning score for Burton's ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' marked a major stylistic shift to dark, densely orchestrated music in the romantic idiom,<ref name=halfyard2004/> which would carry over to his scores for [[Warren Beatty]]'s ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'', [[Sam Raimi]]'s ''[[Darkman]]'' and [[Clive Barker]]'s ''[[Nightbreed]]'', all released in 1990.

Though many believe [[Richard Wagner]] informed his influential score to ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', Elfman has said it was more likely from Wagner's influence on classic film composers such as Herrmann, Steiner, Waxman and Korngold, as he was unfamiliar with Wagner's work at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfcv.org/events-calendar/artist-spotlight/danny-elfman-is-always-eying-the-next-thing|title=Danny Elfman Is Always Eying the Next Thing|last=Kaliss|first=Jeff|date=March 26, 2018|website=San Francisco Classical Voice|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>

Elfman counts Herrmann as his biggest influence, and has said hearing Herrmann's score to ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' when he was a child was the first time he recognized [[Film score|film music]] as a cinematic artform and realized the powerful contribution a composer makes to the movies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/composers-talk-film-scores-83073|title=Composers talk film scores|date=April 28, 2009|website=The Hollywood Reporter|access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref> [[Pasticcio|Pastiche]] of Herrmann's music can be heard in Elfman's ''Pee-Wee's Big Adventure,'' especially the cues "Stolen Bike" and "Clown Dream", which directly reference Herrmann's music from ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' and ''[[The 7th Voyage of Sinbad]]'' respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/pee_wee.html |title=Editorial Reviews: Pee-wee's Big Adventure |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=May 26, 2011 |website=[[Filmtracks]] |access-date=October 23, 2019 |quote=...'Stolen Bike' is perhaps the clearest emulation of Herrmann's fearful tone from Psycho to ever exist (until Elfman ironically re-recorded the classic score in full over a decade later for the remake). }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://fanfarearchive.com/articles/atop/13_2/1320030.aa_Danny_Elfman_Wunderkind_Filmmusic.html |title=Danny Elfman: Wunderkind of Filmmusic – A Profile |date=Nov–Dec 1989 |format=subscription |access-date=September 25, 2019 |quote=As for the Herrmann touch, Elfman was able to draw from that reservoir in some of the film's more inspires dream sequences.

While Elfman is primarily known for writing large-scale orchestral works in the romantic, [[20th-century music|20th century]] and [[Classical Hollywood cinema|Hollywood Golden Age]] [[film score]] traditions, his compositions have used a wide range of idioms, including rock and [[blues]] (''[[Midnight Run]], [[Hot to Trot]]''), [[big band]] and [[jazz]] (''Dick Tracy'', [[Chicago (2002 film)|''Chicago'']]), [[operetta]] (''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'', ''[[Corpse Bride]]''), [[funk]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] (''[[Dead Presidents]]'', ''[[Notorious (2009 film)|Notorious]]''), [[Folk rock|folk]] and [[indie rock]] (''[[Taking Woodstock]]'', ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]''), [[Americana (music)|Americana]] (''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Sommersby]]'', ''[[Big Fish]]),'' [[Minimal music|minimalism]] (''[[Good Will Hunting]]'', [[Standard Operating Procedure (film)|''Standard Operating Procedure'']], ''[[The Unknown Known]]''), and [[Atonality|atonal]] or [[Experimental music|experimental]] (''[[Freeway (1996 film)|Freeway]]'', ''[[A Simple Plan (film)|A Simple Plan]], [[The Girl on the Train (2016 film)|The Girl on the Train]]'').

Given his appreciation and study of world music and his vast collection of instruments from non-Western cultures,<ref name="carruthers2015" /> Elfman will often use traditional instruments in his scores when there is an international setting, such as African percussion for ''[[Instinct (1999 film)|Instinct]],'' the [[oud]] for ''[[The Kingdom (film)|The Kingdom]]'' set in [[Saudi Arabia]], and [[pan flute]] for ''[[Proof of Life]]'' set in South America.

When working on films with established musical identifiers, Elfman will often incorporate original themes in addition to his own thematic material. Examples include [[Lalo Schifrin]]'s main theme and "The Plot" from the original [[Mission: Impossible (1966 TV series)|Mission Impossible TV Series]] for ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'';<ref name="Bond 2019 5-6"/> [[John Williams]]' theme for ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', the [[Hans Zimmer]]/[[Junkie XL]] theme for ''[[Wonder Woman (2017 film)|Wonder Woman]]'' and his own original ''Batman'' theme for ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]];<ref>{{cite news |last=Burton |first=Byron |date=November 18, 2017 |title=Danny Elfman Hates When Reboots Scrap Classic Themes |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/justice-league-danny-elfman-hates-reboots-scrap-classic-themes-1059632 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |access-date=October 10, 2019 |quote=Elfman and Whedon previously worked together on 2015's Avengers: Age of Ultron, another situation he describes as another "three-alarm call."

Even when not directly quoting themes from related films, Elfman will often pay homage through established musical [[Musical gesture|gesture]] or [[Timbre|tonality]], for example [[Howard Shore]]'s ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' for ''[[Red Dragon (2002 film)|Red Dragon]]'', [[Brad Fiedel]]'s music for the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' franchise]] for ''[[Terminator Salvation]]'', [[Bob Cobert|Robert Cobert]]'s original [[Dark Shadows (1966 TV series)|television series]] music for ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]],'' and [[Alan Silvestri]]'s work on ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' for the sequel ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Notable exceptions are Tim Burton's ''Batman'', ''[[Planet of the Apes (2001 film)|Planet of the Apes]]'' and ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]],'' which do not make musical reference to pre existing material.

The songs for ''The Nightmare Before Christmas'' and ''Corpse Bride'' were influenced by [[Kurt Weill]], [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and early [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/4535789/danny-elfman-nightmare-before-christmas-live/|title=Danny Elfman on How 'Nightmare Before Christmas' Endured|last=Berman|first=Eliza|date=October 26, 2016|website=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|access-date=October 26, 2017}}</ref> At the request of Tim Burton, ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'' songs drew inspiration from [[Bollywood]], [[the Mamas and the Papas]], [[ABBA]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], and [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] individually.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://u.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,216~24281~2965262,00.html|title=Elfman goes (chocolate-covered) nuts|last=Lowman|first=Rob|year=2005|website=San Bernardino Sun|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819181642/http://u.sbsun.com/Stories/0,1413,216%7E24281%7E2965262,00.html|archive-date=August 19, 2006|access-date=October 26, 2019}}</ref>

Elfman's work in pop music and specifically as songwriter for [[Oingo Boingo]] was influenced by [[the Specials]], [[Madness (band)|Madness]], [[the Selecter]], [[Devo]], [[Fun Boy Three]], and [[XTC]].<ref name="denman2015" /><ref>{{cite tweet|user=dannyelfman|author=Danny Elfman|author-link=Danny Elfman|number=1146254698976075781|date=2 July 2019|title=Andy Partridge was a huge influence.

==Process==
===Film music===
For his [[film score]]s, Elfman draws musical inspiration almost exclusively from viewing a [[Film editing|cut]] of the film,<ref name="ryzik2015" /> and occasionally from visits to the [[Set construction|set]] while the film is in production (he wrote and orchestrated his theme for [[Batman (1989 film)|''Batman'']] on an airplane to Los Angeles after visiting the set in London).<ref name="AV Club" /> While he prefers not to work from script, story or concept, notable exceptions are ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]],'' for which ten songs needed to be written in advance of filmmaking, and ''[[Dumbo (2019 film)|Dumbo]],'' for which he composed the main theme before filming began.<ref name="burlingame2019" />

Once a [[rough cut]] of the film is ready, Elfman and the director have a [[Film score|spotting session]] to decide where to place music in the film, the emotional undercurrents of each scene, and overall tone.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/1990/02/23/danny-elfman-rise/|title=Danny Elfman: On the rise|last=Givens|first=Ron|date=February 23, 1990|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref> Elfman then spends a few weeks of free composition and experimentation to begin working out thematic material and to develop sounds and the harmonic pallette.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/danny-elfman-exclusive-interview-alice-in-wonderland-talks-wolfman-composing-picking-projects-directors-and-so-much-more/|title=Danny Elfman Exclusive Interview ALICE IN WONDERLAND – Talks WOLFMAN, Composing, More|last=Weintraub|first=Steve|date=March 4, 2010|website=Collider|access-date=October 30, 2019}}</ref>

When he has received approval on initial material from the filmmakers, Elfman begins to compose anywhere from 60 to 120 minutes of music cue-by-cue. He says two of the most important things to capture at this point are the tone of each scene and editorial rhythm. Next to thematic development, action [[set piece]]s tend to take Elfman the most time given the complexity of timing music to action. One element where Elfman's compositional process deviates from most film composers is that he will often compose three or more often radically different versions of a single cue to give the director more options for musicalizing a scene.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}}

Early in his career, he wrote out his scores using pencil, but has composed largely digitally since the mid-1990s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.emusician.com/artists/dannys-big-adventure|title=Danny's Big Adventure|last=Pedersen|first=Greg|date=May 22, 2006|website=EMusician|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>

Before recording the score, he demo<nowiki/>s each cue by mocking orchestral and choral parts on synthesizer to get approval from the director.<ref>{{cite AV media |people=Vienna Symphonic Library |date=April 4, 2014 |title=VSL Studio Chat with Danny Elfman |medium=video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=712ntdvBBTg |access-date=November 6, 2019 }}</ref> Once approved, he provides a detailed, multi-line sketch of his composition to his lead orchestrator [[Steve Bartek]], who ensures the sketches are appropriately broken down for sections of the orchestra (i.e. [[String section|string]], [[Brass section|brass]] [[Woodwind section|woodwind]], some [[Percussion section|percussion]]), choir ([[SATB]]) and individual players.

Elfman also typically samples or records his own percussion and guitar playing to overlay with live orchestra. More than half of some scores feature Elfman's performance,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2001-jan-04-tt-7986-story.html|title=Keeping Score|last=Colker|first=David|date=January 2001|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 14, 2019|quote=I record my own samples, doing my own percussion.

To produce the score, Elfman rents a recording studio and hires a conductor and orchestra/choir. He oversees the recording from the [[control booth]] so that he can troubleshoot with the film's director and [[Audio engineer|recording engineers]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.emu.com/artist/d_elfman/elfman_intrview.html|title=Danny Elfman's big adventure continues in Sleepy Hollow|last1=Lanser|first1=Bryan|year=1999|work=E-mu|access-date=October 30, 2019|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001213004800/http://www.emu.com/artist/d_elfman/elfman_intrview.html|archive-date=December 13, 2000|last2=Monahan|first2=Kevin|quote=I never conduct because the conductor's job for me is answering many questions all at once as quickly as possible, and then to keep things moving...I'm listening in the booth, which is where I prefer to listen anyway because I am hearing closer to the way it's going to sound.}}</ref> The final recording is given to the film's sound department to mix with dialogue and sound effects for the film's complete soundtrack. Elfman will usually do a separate mix of select cues for an album presentation of the score, and has produced nearly 100 to date.<ref name="monger">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/danny-elfman-mn0000569119/discography|title=Danny Elfman {{!}} Album Discography|last=Monger|first=Christopher|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>

On the occasion that there are compressed deadlines or in the event he is not available to rescore or adapt his music if there are major edits to the film after the score's completion, Elfman will hire additional composers to work on small cues or sections of cues, adapting his existing material or themes. Examples include Jonathan Sheffer on ''[[Darkman]]'', [[David Buckley]] on the ''[[Fifty Shades (film series)|Fifty Shades of Grey]]'' films, and [[Pinar Toprak]] on ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmscoremonthly.com/backissues/viewissue.cfm?issueID=168|title=Danny Elfman Part 2: Sound Effects Suck|last=Kendall|first=Lukas|date=December 1, 1995|website=[[Film Score Monthly]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226094728/https://www.filmscoremonthly.com/backissues/viewissue.cfm?issueID=168|archive-date=December 26, 2019|access-date=November 1, 2019}} [http://www.boingo.org/articles/FSMarticle2.html Alt URL]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/fifty_shades3.html|title=Editorial Review: Fifty Shades Freed (Danny Elfman)|date=March 4, 2019|website=[[Filmtracks]]|access-date=November 1, 2019|quote=These projects have always been collaborations between Elfman and David Buckley, some of the concept's more memorable music actually the work of the ghostwriter.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/captain-marvel-composer-pinar-toprak-first-female-composer-of-marvel-movie-2019-3|title=Inside the inspiring journey of 'Captain Marvel' composer Pinar Toprak, from moving to America at 17 to becoming the first female composer of a Marvel movie|last=Guerrasio|first=Jason|date=March 13, 2019|website=[[Business Insider]]|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref> Since the 1990s, Elfman has occasionally co-composed music or shared music writing credit (e.g.''[[When We Rise]]'', ''[[Spy Kids (film)|Spy Kids]]'', ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]], [[Men in Black: International|Men in Black International]]''), or written themes that are then used or adapted by other composers, including Jonathan Sheffer (''[[Pure Luck]]''), [[Steve Bartek]] (''[[Novocaine (film)|Novacaine]]''), [[John Debney]] (''[[Heartbreakers (2001 film)|Heartbreakers]]),'' [[Deborah Lurie]] ([[9 (2009 animated film)|''9'']]), and [[the Newton Brothers]] ([[Before I Wake (2016 film)|''Before I Wake'']]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/pure-luck/|title=Pure Luck Soundtrack (1991)|website=[[Soundtrack.Net]]|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://onemoviefiveviews.blogspot.com/2009/09/music-of-9-interview-with-composer.html|title=The Music of 9 – An Interview With Composer Deborah Lurie|last=Corrado|first=E.|date=September 18, 2009|website=One Movie, Five Views|access-date=November 1, 2019|quote=it was decided that Danny [Elfman] would do the themes for the film, and then I would get to take them, elaborate and score the film around them.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://behindtheaudio.com/2015/09/the-newton-brothers/|title=Scoring as a team: The creative approach of The Newton Brothers|last=Ebbinghaus|first=Peter F.|date=September 23, 2019|website=Behind The Audio|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>

===Concert music===
In the liner notes for the 2006 CD recording of his first concert work ''[[Serenada Schizophrana]]'', Elfman wrote: "I began composing several dozen short improvisational compositions, maybe a minute each. Slowly, some of them began to develop themselves until finally I had six separate movements that, in some abstract, absurd way, felt connected."<ref name=":0"/>

To create the [[cadenza]]s for his violin concerto [[Violin Concerto (Elfman)|''Eleven Eleven'']], Elfman collaborated with soloist Sandy Cameron, for whom the piece was written.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coloradosymphony.org/Blog/elfman-turned-up-to-eleven-eleven|title=Elfman, Turned Up To "Eleven Eleven"|last=Dobreff|first=Nick|date=April 17, 2019|website=Colorado Symphony|access-date=November 1, 2019}}</ref>

===Vocals===
Elfman often incorporates choral or vocal arrangements into his film scores,<ref name="vulture2015" /> notably the use of women's and children's [[choir]]s (''[[Scrooged]]'', ''[[Nightbreed]], [[Edward Scissorhands]], [[Batman Returns]]'', ''[[Sleepy Hollow (film)|Sleepy Hollow]], [[Alice in Wonderland (2010 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[The Grinch (film)|The Grinch]]''), and solo voice or vocal effects (''[[Beetlejuice]]'', ''[[Mars Attacks!]]'', ''[[Men in Black II]]'', ''[[Flubber (film)|Flubber]]'', ''[[Nacho Libre]]'', ''[[Iris (Cirque du Soleil)|Iris]]'', ''[[Dark Shadows (film)|Dark Shadows]]'', ''[[The Girl on the Train (2016 film)|The Girl on the Train]]''). Evoking the "O Fortuna" from [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'', he set made-up, Latin-sounding text for [[SATB]] choir in standout cue "Descent into Mystery" from ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]].''<ref name="halfyard2004" />{{rp|131}}

Elfman also adds his own vocals into compositions in much the same way he mixes his percussion and guitar performances into orchestral arrangements. Prominent use can be heard in the scores for ''[[To Die For]]'' (sung with director [[Gus Van Sant]], credited to "Little Gus and the Suzettes"),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.soundtrack.net/album/to-die-for/ |title=Soundtrack Information: To Die For |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=n.d. |website=[[Soundtrack.Net]] |access-date=November 5, 2019 }}</ref> ''[[Silver Linings Playbook]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.filmtracks.com/titles/silver_linings.html |title=Editorial Review: Silver Linings Playbook |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=December 3, 2012 |website=[[Filmtracks]] |access-date=November 5, 2019 }}</ref> and his music for the [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] ride [[Mystic Manor]].<ref name="napolitano2013" /> He provided the singing voice for characters in ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]'' and ''[[Corpse Bride]]'' in addition to composing the scores and songs'','' and can be heard singing the "Day-O" call in the style of [[Harry Belafonte]]'s "[[Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)|Banana Boat Song]]" in the first bars of the ''Beetlejuice'' [[main title]].<ref name="bond2015" />{{rp|63}}

===Lyrics===

Rare among film composers, Elfman typically writes the [[lyrics]] to songs he has composed for movies. He employs [[song structure]]s from [[Tin Pan Alley]] and early musical theatre composers ([[Thirty-two-bar form|32-bar form]]), and pop and rock of the 1950s and 1960s ([[Verse–chorus form|verse-chorus]]). As his songs serve to advance the plot and develop characters, lyrics reflect storylines and imagery specific to the film and express the inner life of characters.

A major achievement was writing the lyrics and music for ten songs featured in the [[Stop motion|stop-motion]] musical ''[[The Nightmare Before Christmas]]''. Drawing from Tim Burton's parody poem of ''[[A Visit from St. Nicholas]]'' and concept drawings, Elfman wrote each song in consultation with Burton before the film even had a script.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-ca-cm-danny-elfman-jack-skellington-20151025-story.html|title=Danny Elfman can relate to 'Nightmare Before Christmas' hero Jack Skellington|last=Ng|first=David|date=October 24, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=October 14, 2019}}</ref> These include the full-cast songs "This Is Halloween," "Town Meeting Song," and "Making Christmas"; four songs for the main character Jack Skellington "Jack's Lament," "What's This," "Jack's Obsession," and "Poor Jack" all sung by Elfman; and the other character songs "Kidnap the Sandy Claws," "Oogie Boogie's Song," and "Sally's Song."

During his 18 years with Oingo Boingo, Elfman developed significant [[hearing impairment|hearing damage]] as a result of the continuous exposure to the high noise levels involved in performing in a rock band. Afraid of worsening his condition, he decided to leave the band, saying that he would never return to that kind of performance. His impairment was so bad that he could not "even sit in a loud restaurant or bar anymore." However, he found performing in front of orchestras more tolerable, and returned several times to reprise his live performance of [[Jack Skellington]].<ref name=denman2015/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Parker|first1=Lyndsey|title=A Danny Elfman Q&A: From Boingo to Burton|url=https://www.yahoo.com/music/a-danny-elfman-q-a-from-boingo-to-burton-106016969751.html|publisher=Yahoo!|access-date=March 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170309202538/https://www.yahoo.com/music/a-danny-elfman-q-a-from-boingo-to-burton-106016969751.html|archive-date=March 9, 2017|date=December 24, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Ng|first1=David|title='Nightmare Before Christmas' and Danny Elfman returning to Hollywood Bowl for 2016 Hallowee|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-nightmare-before-christmas-danny-elfman-20160824-snap-story.html|access-date=March 9, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160905183058/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-nightmare-before-christmas-danny-elfman-20160824-snap-story.html|archive-date=September 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

==In popular culture==

Since ''[[The Simpsons]]''' second annual ''[[Treehouse of Horror II|Treehouse of Horror]]'' episode aired in 1991, launching "[[Treehouse of Horror#Scary names|scary names]]" tradition in the opening and closing titles, Elfman has been alternately credited for the [[The Simpsons Theme|theme]] music as "Red Wolf Elfman," "Danny Skellingelfman," "Li'l Leakin Brain Elfman," "Boris Elfmonivich," "Danny Elfblood," "Danny 'Hell'fman," "The Bloody Elf," "Danny Elfbones," "Elfmunster" and "Daniel Beilzebelsman."

In the 2007 sixth season ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' parody "[[Blue Harvest]]", ''[[Family Guy]]'' lampooned Elfman's orchestral style.

Episode five of the 14th season of ''[[South Park (season 14)|South Park]]'' in 2010 criticized [[Tim Burton]] for using the "same" music in all his films, referring to Elfman's scores.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://screenrant.com/south-park-stars-forgot-appeared/ |title=20 Stars You Forgot 'Appeared' In South Park |last=Torok |first=Franchesca |date=August 31, 2017 |website=Screenrant |access-date=October 14, 2019 |quote=Tim Burton is ridiculed for having Johnny Depp play main characters in all of his movies, and for using "the same crappy music" (meaning Danny Elfman) in all of his films.}}</ref>
