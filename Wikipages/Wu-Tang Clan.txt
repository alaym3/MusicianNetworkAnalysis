=== Founding ===
In the late 1980s, cousins Robert Diggs, Gary Grice, and Russell Jones formed a group named Force of the Imperial Master, also known as the All in Together Now Crew.<ref name="Exclaim">{{cite web | last = Cowie | first = Del F. | url = http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | title = Days of the Wu at Exclaim.ca | access-date = November 6, 2006 | url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20050428102026/http://www.exclaim.ca/index.asp?layid=22&csid=1&csid1=914 | archive-date = April 28, 2005 }}</ref> Each member recorded under an alias: Grice as The Genius, Diggs as Prince Rakeem or The Scientist, and Jones as The Specialist.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} The group never signed to a major label, but caught the attention of the New York City rap scene and was recognized by rapper [[Biz Markie]].<ref name="RZAInterview">{{cite web | url = http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/rza_english.php3 | title = RZA Interview at HipHopCore.net | access-date = December 26, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060515072710/http://www.hiphopcore.net/interviews/rza_english.php3| archive-date = May 15, 2006}}</ref> By 1991, The Genius and Prince Rakeem were signed to separate record labels.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=369}}</ref> The Genius released ''[[Words from the Genius]]'' (1991) on [[Cold Chillin' Records]] and Prince Rakeem released ''[[Ooh I Love You Rakeem]]'' (1991) on [[Tommy Boy Records]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Both were soon dropped by their labels.

RZA began collaborating with Dennis Coles, later known as Ghostface Killah, another rapper from the [[Stapleton Houses]] in [[Staten Island]]. The duo decided to create a hip hop group whose ethos would be a blend of "[[Eastern philosophy]] picked up from [[kung fu movies]], [[Five Percent Nation]] teachings picked up on the New York streets, and comic books".<ref name="FirstSingle" /> Wu-Tang Clan assembled in late 1992, with RZA as the ''de facto'' leader and the group's producer.<ref name="all music" /> RZA and Ol' Dirty Bastard adopted the name for the group after the film ''[[Shaolin and Wu Tang]]''.<ref name="galaxy">{{cite web|title=The Wu-Tang Clan |url=http://www.hiphopgalaxy.com/Wu-Tang-Clan-hip-hop-2065.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128095208/http://www.hiphopgalaxy.com/Wu-Tang-Clan-hip-hop-2065.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 28, 2006 |work=Hip Hop Galaxy |date=July 26, 2004 |access-date=March 14, 2008 }}</ref> The group developed [[backronym]]s for the name (as hip hop pioneers such as [[KRS-One]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]] did with their names), including "We Usually Take All Niggas' Garments", "Witty Unpredictable Talent And Natural Game", and "Wisdom of the Universe, and the Truth of Allah for the [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Nation of the Gods]]".<ref name="galaxy" />

Wu-Tang Clan became known in 1993 following the release of the independent single "[[Protect Ya Neck]]", which helped gain the group a sizable underground following. Though there was some difficulty in finding a record label that would sign Wu-Tang Clan while still allowing each member to record solo albums with other labels, [[Loud Records|Loud]]/[[RCA Records|RCA]] finally agreed, releasing their debut album, ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', in November 1993. The album loosely adopted a [[Shaolin kung fu|Shaolin]] vs. [[Wudang chuan|Wu-Tang]] theme, dividing the album into Shaolin and Wu-Tang sections.<ref>{{cite news|last=Leckart|first=Steven|date=October 23, 2007|title=Wu-Tang Clan's RZA Breaks Down His Kung Fu Samples by Film and Song|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]|url=https://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/15-11/pl_music|url-status=live|access-date=October 25, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718080133/http://www.wired.com/entertainment/music/magazine/15-11/pl_music|archive-date=July 18, 2008}}</ref> The album received critical acclaim, and to date is regarded as one of the greatest hip hop albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top100RapAlbums_10.htm |title=The Greatest Hip-Hop Albums of all Time&nbsp;– Top 100 Rap/Hip-Hop Albums |publisher=Rap.about.com |date=April 7, 2010 |access-date=April 27, 2010 |archive-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405151731/http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top100RapAlbums_10.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/ |title=Rolling Stone's Music News, Reviews, Photos, Videos, Interviews and More |work=Rolling Stone |access-date=April 27, 2010 |archive-date=February 2, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202024033/https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5938174/the_rs_500_greatest_albums_of_all_time/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="rocklistmusic.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/source.htm |title=Rocklist.net...

=== 1997–2000: ''Wu-Tang Forever'', diversification and second string of solo albums ===
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2021}}
Wu-Tang Clan re-assembled and released their second studio album, ''[[Wu-Tang Forever]]'', in June 1997; it debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The album's lead single, "[[Triumph (Wu-Tang Clan song)|Triumph]]", is over five minutes long, features nine verses (one from each member plus Cappadonna and excluding Ol' Dirty Bastard who appeared on the intro and bridge), and no hook or a repeated phrase. The album was produced by RZA and his protégés [[True Master]] and [[4th Disciple]]. The group's lyrics differed significantly from those of ''36 Chambers'', with many verses written in a dense [[stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] form heavily influenced by the teachings of the [[Five Percent Nation]]. ''Wu-Tang Forever'' was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Album|Best Rap Album]] at the [[40th Grammy Awards|1998 Grammy Awards]], losing to [[Puff Daddy]]; Ol' Dirty Bastard infamously protested the loss by interrupting [[Shawn Colvin]]'s acceptance speech for [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|title=40th Annual GRAMMY Awards|url=http://www.grammy.com/awards/40th-annual-grammy-awards|access-date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>

[[Killah Priest]], a close associate of the group, released ''[[Heavy Mental]]'' in March 1998.<ref>{{Citation|title=Killah Priest – Heavy Mental (1998, CD)|url=https://www.discogs.com/Killah-Priest-Heavy-Mental/release/356409|language=en|access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> That same month, Cappadonna released his debut album ''[[The Pillage]]''. Affiliated groups [[Sunz of Man]] and [[Killarmy]] also released well-received albums, followed by ''[[Wu-Tang Killa Bees: The Swarm]]''—a compilation album released in 1998, showcasing these and more Wu-affiliated artists, and including new solo tracks from the group members themselves. ''The Swarm'' sold well and was certified [[RIAA Certification|gold]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=RIAA |publisher=Riaa.com |access-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225031458/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archive-date=February 25, 2013 }}</ref> There was also a long line of releases from secondary affiliates such as [[Popa Wu]], [[Shyheim]], [[GP Wu]], and [[Wu-Syndicate]]. Second albums from Gravediggaz and Killarmy, as well as a greatest hits album and a b-sides compilation, were also released.

The second round of solo albums from Wu-Tang Clan members included second albums from the five members who had already released albums, as well as debuts from all the remaining members, with the exception of Masta Killa. In the space of two years, RZA's ''[[Bobby Digital In Stereo]]'', Method Man's ''[[Tical 2000: Judgement Day]]'' and ''[[Blackout! (Method Man & Redman album)|Blackout!]]'' (with [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]]), GZA's ''[[Beneath the Surface (GZA album)|Beneath the Surface]]'', Ol' Dirty Bastard's ''[[Nigga Please]]'', U-God's ''[[Golden Arms Redemption]]'', Raekwon's ''[[Immobilarity]]'', Ghostface Killah's ''[[Supreme Clientele]]'' and Inspectah Deck's ''[[Uncontrolled Substance]]'' were all released (seven of them being released in the space of seven months between June 1999 and January 2000). RZA also composed the [[film score|score]] for the film ''[[Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai]]'', directed by [[Jim Jarmusch]], while he and other Wu-Tang members contributed music to a companion "music inspired by the film" album.

The frequent release of Wu-Tang Clan content between 1997 and 2000 was considered by some critics{{Who|date=February 2021}} to have resulted in an oversaturation that was responsible for the group's decline in popularity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p143661|pure_url=yes}} |title=Wu-Tang Clan Biography |website=Allmusic.com |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref>

== Artistry ==

=== Production ===
According to RZA, he tries to have no more than 20–25% sampling on any given record, something starkly different from many other major hip hop groups. He uses "the sampler more like a painter's palette than a [[Xerox]]. Then again, I might use it as a Xerox if I find rare beats that nobody had in their crates yet". He played much of the piano himself, with [[Bill Evans]] and [[Thelonious Monk]] as major influences; for instance, he created the piano part to "Da Mystery of Chessboxin'" after watching the Thelonious Monk documentary, ''Straight, No Chaser''.<ref>The RZA; Chris Norris (January 2005). The Wu-Tang Manual. New York: Riverhead Freestyle, 243 pages. {{ISBN|1-59448-018-4}}</ref>

RZA's production technique, specifically the manner of chopping up and/or speeding or slowing soul samples to fit his beats, has been picked up by currently popular producers, most notably [[Kanye West]] and [[Just Blaze]], the two main producers behind [[Roc-A-Fella Records]]. West's own take on RZA's style<ref>{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel |first=Josh |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1096499-5,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070320224340/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1096499-5,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 20, 2007 |title=Why You Can't Ignore Kanye&nbsp;– TIME |work=Time |date=August 21, 2005 |access-date=January 6, 2009}}</ref> briefly flooded the rap market with what was dubbed "chipmunk soul", the pitch bending of a vocal sample to where it sounded as though the singer had inhaled helium. Several producers at the time copied the style, creating other offshoots. West has admitted that his style was distinctly influenced by RZA's production,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/west_k.htm |title=Gale&nbsp;– Free Resources&nbsp;– Black History&nbsp;– Biographies&nbsp;– Kanye West |publisher=Gale.com |date=June 8, 1977 |access-date=January 6, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615083612/http://www.gale.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/west_k.htm |archive-date=June 15, 2006 }}</ref> and RZA has acknowledged his influence in an issue of [[Scratch (magazine)|''Scratch'' magazine]], saying he wished he had produced "Jesus Walks" and "Breathe", two 2004 hits produced by Kanye West and Just Blaze, respectively. Kanye West commented:

{{quote|Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time... We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples.

=== Lyrics ===
[[Raekwon]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx...]]'' helped (with the likes of [[Kool G Rap]]) popularize the [[mafioso rap|Mafia theme in rap music]] that remained widespread for more than half a decade. The landmark album touted a lifestyle patterned on drug dealing, regrets of living in harsh conditions, and partying (including popularizing the [[Cristal (champagne)|Cristal]] brand of champagne) which [[Nas]], [[Mobb Deep]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Jay-Z]], and other popular artists all borrowed and/or expanded upon these themes at points in their respective careers.

The Wu-Tang Clan's slang has long been a staple of their music, wherein members would blend [[The Nation of Gods and Earths|Five Percenter]] terms, [[Kung Fu]]/oriental words, and comic book and street terms to create their own nicknames for actions, people, places and things (such as the christening of [[Staten Island]] as "Shaolin Land" and money as "C.R.E.A.M."). RZA noted in ''[[The Wu-Tang Manual]]'', that Raekwon was the resident "slang-master" of a great deal of the slang used by the group.

=== Video games ===
All nine original members of the group were featured in the game ''[[Wu-Tang: Shaolin Style]]'', released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] on October 31, 1999, as well as a special collector's edition controller. Ghostface Killah and Yung Dirty Doucette, as well as collaborators, Redman and [[Keith Murray (rapper)|Keith Murray]], also play themselves in all three games in the Def Jam video games ''[[Def Jam Vendetta]]'', ''[[Def Jam Fight For NY]]'', and ''[[Def Jam: Icon]]''.

Method Man is an avid fan of video games himself and has publicly stated that he loves playing [[SOCOM (series)|''SOCOM'']] online with other [[PlayStation 2]] users, and is part of an online clan ("KMA/Kiss My Ass"). His ''[[SOCOM II]]'' name is "ICU". He has a fellow ''SOCOM'' player featured on a skit on his album ''4:21... The Day After''.

In ''[[Army of Two]]'', main character Salem talks about Wu-Tang asking his teammate Rios who the best member is. Salem says it's RZA but he says Ghostface Killah is pretty good himself. In the ending cut scene, a reference is made when Salem says "Survey says?" and Rios replies "You're dead". The exchange referenced the lyric, "And the survey says? / You're dead!" from "Wu-Tang Clan Ain't Nuthin' Ta F' Wit", from the album ''Enter the Wu-Tang Clan (36 Chambers)''.

Several tracks by Clan members and affiliates such as Method Man, Ghostface, Cappadonna, Trife, DJ Mathematics and others were featured in the 2006 game ''[[Saints Row]]''.

''[[Afro Samurai (video game)|Afro Samurai]]'', based on the TV series, was released in January 2009 for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. Its soundtrack, like the show, was produced by RZA.

=== Clothing line ===
[[Oliver "Power" Grant]] was one of the first to move from music to clothes. The Clan's executive producer, Grant began making clothes in the early 1990s, with little success. But in 1995, after the platinum success of ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', manufacturers who earlier wouldn't extend Power credit saw the potential. He opened four Wu Wear stores, in New York City, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Norfolk, Virginia. The line was carried in Macy's, Rich's, and d.e.m.o, among others. Power says he earned $10 million in 1998.<ref>Vibe Magazine. Vbeat: Clan in da Front by Linda Hobbs. November 2007. Page 52.</ref>

Method Man was unhappy with the decision to bring Wu-Tang into the fashion world with Wu Wear, despite the brand being a major money-maker for the group. "When Wu-Wear started making shoes and sneakers and pants, it was shoddy material. I never rocked that shit."<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=512 |title=Dear Superstar: Method Man Article on Blender :: The Ultimate Guide to Music and More |publisher=Blender.com |access-date=January 6, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224023412/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=512 |archive-date=February 24, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1999, Nike released a Wu-Tang Clan themed dunk hi. The shoes were produced in low quantities. Their rarity and popularity makes them very sought after, with reseller prices as much as $7,500.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flightclubny.com/p.php?fc=ny&c=dunk&i=030453 |title=nike dunk hi · "wu-tang" · 630335 073 |publisher=Flightclubny.com |access-date=April 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305051441/http://www.flightclubny.com/p.php?fc=ny&c=dunk&i=030453 |archive-date=March 5, 2010  }}</ref>

A partnership between Wu-Tang and the Alife NYC clothing group took place in 2007 through 2008 for an exclusive series of custom sneakers, T-shirts, hoodies and other accessories for men and women. The collection was named "A Wu-Tang Life".
