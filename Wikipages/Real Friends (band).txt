==History==
===Formation and EPs (2010–13)===
In the fall of 2010 bassist Kyle Fasel "wasn't happy" with the music he was working on and wished to start over.<ref name=NGU>{{cite AV media |people=Real Friends|year=2013 |title=Never Growing Up, Never Giving Up |medium=Documentary |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ezwSwwDg1y0|publisher=Real Friends |time=0:41–1:22 for early beginnings; 1:42–2:08 for Lambton joining; 2:25–43 for early sound; 2:49–3:14 for Brian Blake; 3:49–4:11 for live guitarists and Eric Haines; 6:07–7:06 for popularity increase following ''Everyone That Dragged You Here''; 10:46–57 for Gary Weissmann}}</ref> Fasel called lead guitarist Dave Knox and the pair soon started talking about the goals they wished to achieve.<ref name=NGU/> Fasel didn't expect it to lead anywhere.<ref name=NGU/> Vocalist Dan Lambton, who was friends with Knox, received a call from Fasel, asking if he would like to join him and Knox.<ref name=NGU/> They were soon joined by drummer Aaron Schuck.<ref name=AMbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/real-friends-mn0003117973/biography|title=Real Friends – Biography – AllMusic|author=Lymangrover, Jason |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=July 16, 2015}}</ref> The band recorded its debut EP, ''This Is Honesty'', in the spring of 2011. Following the release of the EP, the band began playing shows around the Midwest. The group soon realized that it "didn't feel right [playing the songs they currently had]. [...] almost forc[ing] ourselves into [a] sound."<ref name=NGU/> They had a meeting and came to the conclusion to start over.<ref name=NGU/> During this period, Fasel and Knox were playing in The Fastest Kid Alive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thelewisflyer.com/tfka-strives-for-new-musical-direction/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803155059/http://thelewisflyer.com/tfka-strives-for-new-musical-direction/|url-status=dead|archive-date=August 3, 2015|title=TFKA strives for new musical direction|work=thelewisflyer.com|author=Prokop, Jennifer|date=October 3, 2011|access-date=August 3, 2015}}</ref> Shortly afterwards, Schuck was replaced by Brian Blake.<ref name=AMbio/> Blake had emailed the band after he found out they needed a drummer.<ref name=NGU/>

Real Friends didn't have a permanent second guitarist, often having their friends to substitute.<ref name=NGU/> Eric Haines soon joined as rhythm guitarist.<ref name=AMbio/> Until Haines joined, Fasel and Knox would typically write the songs, and, according to Fasel, they didn't have "another guitar[ist's] opinion".<ref name=NGU/> Shortly after the release of the ''Everyone That Dragged You Here'' EP, the band's popularity and the audience at their shows increased.<ref name=NGU/> The band later released the ''Put Yourself Back Together'' EP.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3159921|title=Real Friends to Release New EP Next Month|work=AbsolutePunk.net|author=DiVincenzo, Alex |date=May 2, 2013|access-date=July 16, 2015}}</ref> Reviewing the EP for ''[[Rock Sound]]'', Andy Biddulph noted that he would not be "surprised" if the band was "mixing it with the big boys in a year's time".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rocksound.tv/reviews/read/real-friends-put-yourself-back-together|title=Real Friends – Put Yourself Back Together|work=Rock Sound Magazine|author=Biddulph, Andy |date=June 23, 2013|access-date=July 16, 2015}}</ref> In November, the group supported [[The Wonder Years (band)|The Wonder Years]] on their UK shows, including UK [[Warped Tour]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_wonder_years_announce_additional_uk_dates_with_real_friends|title=The Wonder Years announce additional UK dates with Real Friends|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|author=Obenschain, Philip |date=June 11, 2013|access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref>
