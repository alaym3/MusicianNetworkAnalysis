'''Rose Royce''' is an American [[Soul music|soul]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] group. They are best known for several [[hit single]]s during the 1970s including "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]", "[[I Wanna Get Next to You]]", "[[I'm Going Down (Rose Royce song)|I'm Going Down]]", "[[Wishing on a Star]]", and "[[Love Don't Live Here Anymore]]".

==Career==
{{tone|section|date=July 2016}}
The [[Los Angeles]]-based group comprised [[Gwen Dickey]] (vocals), Henry Garner (drums), Terral "Terry" Santiel (congas), Lequeint "Duke" Jobe (bass), Michael Moore (saxophone), Kenny Copeland (trumpet, lead vocals), Kenji Brown (guitar, lead vocals), Freddie Dunn (trumpet), and Victor Nix (keyboards).<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=221}}</ref>  The group began in the early 1970s, when members of several backup bands from the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] and [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] areas of Los Angeles united under the name Total Concept Unlimited.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1973, this collective toured England and Japan behind Motown soul star [[Edwin Starr]].<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/rose-royce-mn0000343215/biography|title=Rose Royce - Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 April 2019}}</ref>  Starr introduced them to [[Norman Whitfield]].<ref>Album notes by A. Scott Galloway, ''The Very Best of Rose Royce'', 2001, Warner Bros.</ref>

Whitfield, after a decade at Motown, wanted to start a company of his own. He took the T.C.U. [[Octet (music)|octet]] under his wing and signed them to his label.  The group, now called Magic Wand, began working with [[Yvonne Fair]] and became the studio and concert band for [[The Undisputed Truth]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  During a tour stop in Miami, Undisputed Truth leader Joe Harris noticed a singer named [[Gwen Dickey]], then a member of a local group called The Jewels. Harris informed Whitfield of his discovery and Dickey was flown to Los Angeles to audition. In Dickey, Whitfield found the ingredient he felt was missing in Magic Wand: a charismatic female singer. He gave her the stage name [[Rose Norwalt]]. The original band line-up, now complete, prepared their debut album.

During this time, Whitfield was contacted by film director [[Michael Schultz]], fresh from the success of his first feature, ''[[Cooley High]]''.  Schultz offered Whitfield the opportunity to score his next picture, ''[[Car Wash (film)|Car Wash]]''. Whitfield would use the film to launch his new group and began composing music based on script outlines.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> He and the band visited the film set, soaking up the atmosphere. This was one of the rare instances in Hollywood in which the music was composed concurrently with the picture instead of after the fact. In the spirit of the soundtrack, the band's name was changed one final time to 'Rose Royce'.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  The name not only referenced the movie's automotive theme, but it also placed Gwen "Rose" Dickey front and center. Further, it hinted at a touch of class the band strove to bring to 1970s soul-funk.<ref>A. Scott Galloway album notes, ''The Very Best of Rose Royce'', 2001 Warner Bros</ref>

The movie ''Car Wash'' and the soundtrack were great successes, bringing the group national fame.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Whitfield won the Best Music award at the Cannes Film Festival, and the album received the Grammy for Best Motion Picture Score Album of the Year. Released in late 1976, the soundtrack featured three [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard]] R&B Top Ten singles: "[[Car Wash (song)|Car Wash]]," "[[I Wanna Get Next to You]]," and "[[I'm Going Down (Rose Royce song)|I'm Going Down]]."<ref name="AMG"/> The first of these was also a number one single on the Billboard popular music chart, and "I Wanna Get Next to You" reached number 10.

The group's follow-up album, ''Rose Royce II: In Full Bloom'', produced two Top Ten singles, "Do Your Dance" and "[[Ooh Boy (song)|Ooh Boy]]".<ref name="AMG"/>  It also included "[[Wishing on a Star]]", which for Rose Royce was a top-10 hit only in the UK;<ref name="LarkinSM"/> it became notable elsewhere through its cover versions, including [[The Cover Girls]]' Top Ten single in 1992.

During 1978, they released their third album, entitled ''Rose Royce III: Strikes Again!'', and it featured "I'm in Love (And I Love the Feeling)" and "[[Love Don't Live Here Anymore]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Both singles entered the Billboard R&B Top Five.<ref name="AMG"/>  "Love Don't Live Here Anymore" was a number 2 hit in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and would later gain greater exposure through its cover versions, most notably by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] in 1984 and 1995.

The group followed with a series of modest successes that reached the charts, but never gained the status that their previous songs did.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Dickey left the group in April 1980 and Rose Royce temporarily disbanded.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

Rose Royce was featured in the [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]'s seasonal series, ''Unsung'' during the spring of 2010.  The story featured the successes and internal bickering of the group.  Dickey, Copeland, Jobe, Moore and Garner were the only members of the band who gave interviews throughout the program. Dickey now performs as a solo artist in the UK, but mentioned during the interview that she would not mind performing with the group once again. From 2012-2013, R&B vocalist [[Debelah Morgan]] joined the band as their lead singer for a few shows. Additionally, [[Bag Raiders]] and [[Daft Punk]] sampled their single "First Come First Served" with the songs "[[Shooting Stars (Bag Raiders song)|Shooting Stars]]" and "[[Too Long (Daft Punk song)|Too Long]]" respectively. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://klnpublishingllc.blogspot.com/2012/06/rose-royce-blast-from-past-that.html|title=KLN Publishing, LLC: Rose Royce - A blast from the past that everyone still loves|first=Kevin L.|last=Nichols|date=21 June 2012|website=Klnpublishingllc.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianapolisrecorder.com/aroundtown/article_801c01f6-31cd-11e3-a162-001a4bcf887a.html|title=Classy Soul at the Classic|first=BRANDON A.|last=PERRY|website=Indianapolisrecorder.com}}</ref>

+ ''The Show Must Go On'' appears to be an unreleased album recorded near the end of the group's association with [[Streetwave Records]] in the mid-1980s; apart from the single "Love Me Right Now" (which lists ''The Show Must Go On'' as its parent album), there seems to be no existing information about any songs from the album or an album cover.
