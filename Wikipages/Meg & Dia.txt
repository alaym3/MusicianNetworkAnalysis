'''Meg & Dia''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2004. It was founded by sisters Meg and [[Dia Frampton]] before becoming a five-piece act (renamed Cowards Courage and released the CD ''Straight Out of a Story Book in Las Vegas'') where they started, with additional members Eddie Friends, Ryan Hardy, Jon Cash and Alex Kruse. With the departure of the latter four, Meg & Dia subsequently reverted to their root name with additional members Nicholas Price, Jonathan Snyder (formerly of [[Madison (band)|Madison]]) and Carlo Gimenez.

Meg & Dia (also then known as The Meg & Dia Band) released their debut album, ''[[#Our Home is Gone|Our Home is Gone]]'', in 2005. At the time, the band consisted of just the two Frampton sisters, and the album's tracks were mostly [[Acoustic guitar|acoustic]] songs. Meg played guitar and provided back-up vocals while Dia sang. A year later, they released their second album, ''[[Something Real (Meg & Dia album)|Something Real]]'', their first album released under [[Doghouse Records]].

The band signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]] in 2007 and released ''[[Here, Here and Here]]'' in 2009 via [[Sire Records]]. Before disbanding, they were signed under the name Dia Frampton to [[Universal Republic]].

==History==

===Early Life: The Frampton sisters===
[[File:Meg and Dia at Warped Tour.JPG|thumb|right|Dia (left) and Meg (right)]]Meg received a karaoke machine and Dia received a guitar as a Christmas gift. Dia began singing at local county fairs and retirement centers while Meg taught herself to play songs that were on the radio.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://meganddia.com/about.php|title=about Meg & Dia|work=Meg & Dia official website|access-date=November 10, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071104111813/http://www.meganddia.com/about.php |archive-date = November 4, 2007}}</ref> Their father was a DJ in South Korea, and the sisters often listened to his extensive record collection. The family of the Frampton sisters is composed of Meg, Dia, Jade, Rena, Nikki, Misty. Jade plays tennis for the University of Arkansas and she aspires to be a professional in the near future.<ref name="bio" />

“For Christmas when we were kids, ironically Dia got the guitar and I got the karaoke machine. We quickly learned, however, what we were natural at and destined to become. She became really focused on her voice and began singing little country ditties at local county fairs and retirement centers. I started out playing whatever was on the radio or whatever happened to be in my buddies' CD player. My dad was a DJ in his early twenties so he had quite an extensive record collection that I listened to occasionally. After I experienced my first heartbreak and I thought the world was going to end, the natural way to console my tattered heart was to write a song. Of course my parents, being the supportive and loving caretakers they are, showered me with much undeserved praise and encouraged me to keep writing. My sister and I heeded their advice and began writing and playing original songs together." – Meg<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.meganddia.com/about.php

===2005: debut ''Our Home Is Gone''===
{{anchor|Our Home is Gone}}
Meg & Dia self-released their debut album, ''Our Home Is Gone'', in 2005. Only 1,000 copies were ever produced (all of which were distributed by the Frampton girls themselves). The album featured a mostly [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] style of music, as it was only Meg and Dia in the band. They toured extensively in support of it, sharing stages with such national acts as [[Limbeck]], [[The Format]], [[Mêlée (band)|Melee]], [[An Angle]], [[Koufax (band)|Koufax]], and [[Steel Train]].

After a few acoustic shows playing the songs from their debut album, they decided they needed a bigger sound. They recruited drummer Nicholas Price, and later guitarist Kenji Chan in 2005. Nick was Meg's car mechanic after she was involved in a minor car accident (which also is the result of the name for the EP What Is It? A Fender Bender). After Nick joined, Meg and Dia found bassist Ryan Groskreuetz. The songs "Nineteen Stars" and "Indiana" were included on the Frampton sisters' next album, Something Real. "Timmy" was re-worked into song "Roses" for Something Real.<ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.meganddia.com/about.php|title=About Meg & Dia|work=Meg & Dia official website|access-date=September 8, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701130131/http://www.meganddia.com/about.php |archive-date = July 1, 2007}}</ref>

===2006: ''Something Real''===
In January 2006 Meg and Dia recorded a second album, ''[[Something Real (Meg & Dia album)|Something Real]]'', with producer [[Stacy Jones (musician)|Stacy Jones]] of [[American Hi-Fi]] and Bill Leffler. As a teaser for the album, Meg & Dia released an EP titled ''What Is It? A Fender Bender'', on both [[iTunes]] and the [[Tower Records]] website in July 2006. ''What Is It? A Fender Bender'' featured "Monster" and "Indiana", and would also be part of their upcoming album. That album was soon-after released on August 8, 2006. ''Something Real'' is made up both new works and revamped versions of acoustic songs from ''Our Home is Gone''. The songs "Indiana", "Masterpiece", and "Nineteen Stars" were rerecorded with a full band, while parts of "Timmy" were incorporated into the song "Roses".

In September 2006, it was announced on the Meg & Dia MySpace page that guitarist Kenji Chan was leaving the band to focus on his solo career. His departure was on amicable terms. The band found a replacement guitarist via YouTube,  Canadian Carlo Gimenez,<ref name="anarchy" /> and the band was once again a five-piece act.

The band gained popularity through self-promotion via [[MySpace.com|MySpace]]; they were selected as the official MySpace band on the [[Warped Tour 2006]]. Being selected as the official MySpace band came about in a peculiar way; technical staff were supposed to shut down Meg & Dia's official MySpace due to a virus script posted by an unscrupulous character. However, the technical difficulties resulted in the band gaining the attention of [[Tom Anderson (MySpace)|Tom Anderson]], co-founder of MySpace, who then entered them into a contest to become the official MySpace band at Warped Tour; Meg & Dia won.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouserecords.com/v2/review.php?review=47|title=Thanks to a computer virus..|work=doghouserecords.com|access-date=September 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110011111/http://www.doghouserecords.com/v2/review.php?review=47|archive-date=November 10, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Meg & Dia played at Warped Tour 2006 in the MySpace tent, which had a dirt floor in lieu of a stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.a-pathetic.net/zine/archives/179#more-179|title=Meg and Dia: A Masterpiece in the Making|work=Shout!|access-date=November 12, 2007}}</ref>

''[[Here, here and here]]'' was released on April 21, over a year after recording was completed. It was sold in three formats- CD, CD + DVD package, and on vinyl. The album marks the band's first new release since signing with Warner Bros. (distributed through [[Sire Records]]) and the first with the band's current lineup. Musically, the album differs from previous efforts, as a result of experimentation with new instruments (strings, synths, harmonica and alternative percussion) and the inclusion of guest vocals ([[Tom Higgenson]] on "Bored Of Your Love"). Tonally, the album includes more mature themes such as religion ("Black Wedding") and politics ("Are There Giants Too, In The Dance?"). In contrast to the heavily literature-inspired ''Something Real'', only one song from ''here, here and here'' has been definitively linked to a novel ("Hug Me" was inspired by [[Brave New World]]), and several songs were written by Dia in response to her then recent breakup ("Going Away").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meganddia.com/news/2009/04/15/story-here-here-and-here-dia |title=The story of "Here, here and here" by Dia |access-date=May 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090424071757/http://www.meganddia.com/news/2009/04/15/story-here-here-and-here-dia |archive-date=April 24, 2009 }}</ref> The title of the album comes from the eponymous closing track, which alludes to the composition process of [[Mozart]] in the lines: "'Here, Here, and Here.'

===2010–2012: Independent, ''Stormy'', ''Cocoon'', and break up===
In July 2010, Meg & Dia announced that they were dropped from their label, [[Warner Bros. Records]]. Meg & Dia remain unsigned. The band has confirmed that they have recorded a new record, independent of a label, with producer Charlie Vela.

The band released the EP ''It's Always Stormy in Tillamook'' on November 2. For the first 500 people that ordered a physical copy from their website, a password and link was emailed to receive the secret song "Down The Open Road." Meg and Dia toured from November 9 – December 4 across the continental United States with Joey Ryan and The Spring Standards.

On April 5, 2011 the band released its fourth studio album titled ''[[Cocoon (Meg & Dia album)|Cocoon]]'', featuring 11 tracks.

On June 29, Dia Frampton was named the runner-up on the television show ''[[The Voice (U.S.)|The Voice]].'' She came in second to [[Javier Colon]]. On December 6, she released her solo debut record, ''[[Red (Dia Frampton album)|Red]]''.

On December 20, the band released the EP "Be Careful, I Love You, Stay In Touch", featuring songs that didn't make it on "Cocoon." It was previously only available to those who frequently commented on the Meg & Dia forums via dropcards.com.

On October 29, 2012, Meg Frampton posted an official statement announcing the official disbandment of Meg & Dia to go back to school and concentrate on her solo career. She stated that she and Nick Price are still making music together as are Dia Frampton and Carlo Gimenez, but no more music was to be released under the name Meg & Dia.<ref name="disband">{{cite web

Dia often recorded a "song diary," an impromptu recorded song, on her MySpace page. She explained, "It was something very raw, and to be honest, something that I was slightly embarrassed to put up because of the quality but I did anyways, for any of our listeners who would care to hear something not hot off the production belt, but something more organic and 'home made.' It made me feel better to share my feelings with people who could connect, and I think that is what happened with many."<ref>[http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/10/dia-thinks-in-song.html Teen Vogue interview] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110330043752/http://www.teenvogue.com/industry/blogs/music/2008/10/dia-thinks-in-song.html |date=March 30, 2011 }}</ref>

Currently, she plays a glittery-gold Gretsch guitar on the Dia Frampton and Blake Shelton tours. For acoustic songs, she played a Taylor 814ce acoustic. Meg often performed wearing cap sleeve dresses. For the Blake Shelton and Dia Frampton tours, she wears a black sequin dress and silver sequin heels (which she refers to as her "heels of death.") Meg provides the lead vocals and plays keyboard for the song "Rebecca". Recently Meg has provided intro solos for some of the band's songs during live performances such as Roses and Monster. Meg Frampton decided to leave the band in June 2012 for personal and creative reasons. Jimmy Welsh, formerly of the Boston band Small Talk, has joined the band to fill in for Meg.
