'''Hot Chocolate''' are a British [[Soul music|soul]] band popular during the 1970s and 1980s, formed by [[Errol Brown]] and [[Tony Wilson (musician)|Tony Wilson]]. The act had at least one [[hit record|hit]] every year from 1970 to 1984, and their 1975 song "[[You Sexy Thing]]" made the [[Top 40|Top 10]] in three decades.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Beginnings==
Formed in 1968, the band initially consisted of vocalist Errol Brown, guitarist Franklyn De Allie, drummer Jim King (shortly thereafter replaced by the unrelated Ian King), percussionist Patrick Olive, and bassist Tony Wilson;<ref name="badcatrecords1">{{cite web|url=http://badcatrecords.com/BadCat/HOTCHOCOLATE.htm |title=B |website=Badcatrecords.com|access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref> with keyboardist Larry Ferguson joining the band in the following year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp2/features/top5/hot_chocolate.shtml |title=Top of the Pops 2 – Top 5 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=24 September 2014 |access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref> The band was originally named "Hot Chocolate Band" by Mavis Smith, who worked for the [[Apple Corps]] press office. This was quickly shortened first to "The Hot Chocolate" and then to "Hot Chocolate" by [[Mickie Most]]. By 1970 the band's line-up had changed again to include Harvey Hinsley and Tony Connor (who was also a member of [[Audience (band)|Audience]] at the time) replacing De Allie and King respectively.<ref name="badcatrecords1"/>

Hot Chocolate started their recording career making a [[reggae]] version of [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Give Peace a Chance]]", but frontman Errol Brown was told he needed permission. He was contacted by [[Apple Records]], discovered that Lennon liked his version, and the group was subsequently signed to Apple Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/377/errol_brown_a_fondent_farewell/ |title=ERROL BROWN: A Fondent Farewell |publisher=Bluesandsoul.com |access-date=30 December 2011}}</ref> The link was short-lived as [[the Beatles]] were starting to break up, and the Apple connection soon ended.

Later in 1970 Hot Chocolate, with the help of record producer Mickie Most, began releasing tracks that became hits, such as "[[Love Is Life]]", "[[Emma (song)|Emma]]", "[[You Could Have Been a Lady]]" (a US and Canadian hit for [[April Wine]]), and "I Believe in Love". All those releases were on the [[Rak Records|Rak]] record label, owned by Most. Brown and bassist Tony Wilson wrote most of their original material, and also provided hits for [[Herman's Hermits]], "Bet Yer Life I Do", [[Julie Felix]], "Heaven is Here", and [[Mary Hopkin]], "Think About Your Children".
 
Gradually the band started to become [[UK Singles Chart]] regulars. One of the hits from this period, "[[Brother Louie (Hot Chocolate song)|Brother Louie]]", featured a guest spoken vocal from [[Alexis Korner]].

==Success==
It was in the [[disco]] era of the mid-1970s that Hot Chocolate became a big success. A combination of high production standards, the growing confidence of the main songwriting team of Wilson and Brown, and tight vocal [[harmonies]] enabled them to secure further big hits such as "You Sexy Thing" and "[[Every 1's a Winner (song)|Every 1's a Winner]]", which were also US hits, peaking at No. 3 (1976) and No. 6 (1979), respectively. After Wilson's departure for a solo career, that included a 1976 album ''I Like Your Style'', Brown assumed all songwriting duties. Wilson was initially replaced by Brian Satterwhite; before Satterwhite departed the band and Olive switched to bass as his primary instrument.<ref name="badcatrecords1"/>

In 1977, after 15 hits, they finally reached [[Chart-topper|Number One]] with "[[So You Win Again]]". It was one of the few of their recordings that was not written, at least partly, by Brown<ref name="British Hit Singles"/> The track was a [[Russ Ballard]] composition.<ref name="British Hit Singles"/>

The band became the only group, and one of just three acts, that had a hit in every year of the 1970s in the UK charts (the other two being [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Diana Ross]]).<ref name="British Hit Singles">{{cite book

The band eventually had at least one hit, every year, between 1970 and 1984.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/britishhitsingle0000unse British Hit Singles & Albums] Archive.org</ref> 

The band continued well into the 1980s, and clocked up another big hit record: "[[It Started with a Kiss (song)|It Started with a Kiss]]", in 1982, which reached Number 5 in the UK. In all, the group charted 25 [[UK Top 40]] hit singles. Their single "You Sexy Thing" became the only track that made British [[Record chart|Top Ten]] status in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/britishhitsingle0000unse British Hit Singles & Albums] Archive.org</ref>

In 1987, Dutch DJ and producer [[Ben Liebrand]] made [[remix]]es of the Hot Chocolate hits;<ref>'' [http://www.liebrand.com/la/awards/choc.html Liebrand Award Hot Chocolate] '' Liebrand.com Retrieved 2021-05-02 </ref> '' You Sexy Thing '' and '' Every 1's a Winner''.<ref>''[http://www.liebrand.com/productions/index.html Index Liebrand Productions]''Liebrand.com Retrieved 2021-05-02</ref> Liebrand also made a combination remix of those two hits called ''Two in a Bed'' <ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OskVvra6kzc Two in a bed (1987)]''Youtube.com</ref> for the exclusive [[Disco Mix Club]].

==Later years==
Renewed interest in Hot Chocolate came in part with the band’s appearances on a string of successful film soundtracks starting with the 1997 comedy ''[[The Full Monty]]'', as well as in a 1989 acne lotion commercial (featuring a young [[Patsy Palmer]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.downloadablemovies.org/content/watch/clearasil-advert-1989-patsy-palmer-1980s-44030.htm |title=Download &#124; Clearasil Advert 1989 (Patsy Palmer) 1980s |publisher=Downloadablemovies.org |access-date=13 January 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> From the late 1980s onwards the group experienced a resurgence of credibility: [[Urge Overkill]], [[PJ Harvey]] and [[the Sisters of Mercy]] all added Hot Chocolate songs to their live sets,<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book

Errol Brown and Larry Ferguson departed the band in 1986; ultimately leading the group to disband. Brown then began a solo career. Two of his singles made the UK Singles Chart – "Personal Touch" and "Body Rockin'". Hot Chocolate had a hit in 1988 in Germany. "Never Pretend" was written by Harvey Hinsley and Susan Stuttard, and the vocalist was Grant Evelyn.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hot-Chocolate-Never-Pretend/release/1536964 |title=Hot Chocolate – Never Pretend (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=discogs |access-date=29 July 2014}}</ref> The band's enduring popularity was verified when two [[compilation album]]s both reached No. 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]] (see below). In 2003, [[Errol Brown]] received the [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]; and in 2004, the [[Ivor Novello Award]] for his contribution to British music.

In 1992 the band reformed with new vocalist Greg Bannis and keyboardists Steve Ansell, Andy Smith, Willy Dowling, and Steve Matthews (the latter two of whom departed the band in 1994), and manager and agent Ric Martin took control over the band's bookings and live appearances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegreatrockbible.com/portfolio-item/hot-chocolate-biography/ |title=HOT CHOCOLATE biography |publisher=The Great Rock Bible |date=23 November 2014 |access-date=10 October 2016}}</ref> Kennie Simon took over lead vocals in 2010 following the departure of Bannis and Hot Chocolate continue to make [[concert|live appearances]] in the UK and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hot-chocolate.co.uk |title=Home |publisher=Hot Chocolate |access-date=7 April 2013}}</ref>

On 6 May 2015, original frontman and principal songwriter Errol Brown died from liver cancer. He was 71.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-32613573 |title=Errol Brown, Hot Chocolate singer, dies aged 71 – BBC News |publisher=BBC |access-date=4 July 2015}}</ref>
