In the [[lineal kinship]] system used in the English-speaking world, a '''niece''' or '''nephew''' is a child of the subject's [[sibling]] or [[sibling-in-law]]. The [[converse relation]]ship, the relationship from the niece or nephew's perspective, is that of an [[aunt]] or [[uncle]]. A niece is female and a nephew is male. The term '''nibling''' has been used in place of the common, gender-specific terms in some specialist literature.<ref name="nibling">{{cite book|last=Conklin|first=Harold C.|editor=Ward Hunt Goodenough|title=Explorations in Cultural Anthropology: Essays in Honor of George Peter Murdock|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/explorationsincu00good|chapter-url-access=registration|year=1964|publisher=McGraw-Hill|page=[https://archive.org/details/explorationsincu00good/page/35 35]|chapter=Ethnogenealogical method}}</ref>

As aunt/uncle and niece/nephew are separated by two generations they are an example of [[second-degree relative|second-degree relationship]] and are 25% [[Consanguinity|related]] if related by blood.

These French-derived terms displaced the [[Middle English]] ''nyfte, nift, nifte'', from [[Old English]] ''nift'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''niftiz'' (“niece”); and the [[Middle English]] ''neve, neave'', from [[Old English]] ''nefa'', from [[Proto-Germanic]] *''nefô'' (“nephew”).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PvhJCgAAQBAJ&q=nyfte,+nephew&pg=PT57|title=A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages|first=Carl Darling|last=Buck|date=3 July 2008|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226228860|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ymcm0Lt9sR0C&q=proto+germanic+nefo&pg=PA96|title=From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanic: A Linguistic History of English|first=Donald|last=Ringe|date=31 August 2006|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780191536335|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DcdbAAAAMAAJ&q=proto+germanic+nefo|title=German kinship terms, 750-1500: documentation and analysis|first=William Jervis|last=Jones|date=19 March 1990|publisher=W. de Gruyter|isbn=9780899255736|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&q=proto+germanic+nefo&pg=PA239|title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|first1=J.

A nephew might have more rights of inheritance than the uncle's daughter.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Stahl|first1=Anne|title=Victims who Do Not Cooperate with Law Enforcement in Domestic Violence Incidents|date=2007|page=19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://calternatives.org/resource/pdf/Marginality,%20Modes%20of%20insecurity%20and%20Indigenous%20Women%20of%20Northern%20Bangladesh.pdf|title=Marginality, Modes of insecurity and Indigenous Women of Northern Bangladesh|last=Chakraborty|first=Eshani|website=calternatives.org|access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>
