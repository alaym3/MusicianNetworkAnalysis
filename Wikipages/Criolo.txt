'''Kleber Cavalcante Gomes''', or '''Criolo''' ([[São Paulo]], September 5, 1975), is a Brazilian singer, rapper, songwriter and actor. With a career starting in 1989, he was originally known in [[Brazil]] as the creator of Rinha dos MC's, but has gained worldwide attention for his solo work and, in particular, the album ''Nó Na Orelha'' (2011). In 2019, he was nominated for two [[Latin Grammy Award|Latin Grammy Awards]], for "Boca de Lobo" (Best Music Video, Short Version) and "Etérea" (Best Song in Portuguese).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/es/nominees|title=20a Entrega Anual del Latin GRAMMY|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=es|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>

==Early life and career ==
Born to migrants from the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|North East of Brazil]] in the commercial hub of São Paulo, Criolo was born in the 'Favela das Imbuias', one of the many [[shanty town]]s that girdle the city.

Since the age of 11, Criolo concentrated on his love for rap, performing in small venues around his neighbourhood for many years before finally releasing his debut album ‘‘Ainda Há Tempo’’ in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/art-soothes-the-soul-it-calms-us-gives-us-warmth-an-interview-with-criolo-16886/|title=Art Soothes The Soul, It Calms Us, Gives Us Warmth: An Interview with Criolo|date=2012-11-14|website=Sounds and Colours|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> This led to a reputation as one of the most important rappers in São Paulo. His second album, “Nó na Orelha”, issued in Brazil in 2011 and internationally in 2012, saw his popularity grow beyond São Paulo and Brazil to other countries, leading to live shows in [[Adelaide]], [[Amsterdam]], [[Berlin]], [[Cannes]], [[Dijon]], [[Ghent]], [[Glasgow]], [[Leuven]], [[Lisbon]], [[Los Angeles]], [[London]], [[Manchester]], [[New York City|New York]], [[Ozark]], [[Paris]], [[Rome]], [[Roskilde]], [[Saint-Florent, Haute-Corse|Saint-Florent]], [[Saint-Nazaire]], [[Sao Isidro]], [[Sete]], and [[Vence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songkick.com/artists/4626158-criolo/gigography|title=Criolo Gigography, Tour History & Past Concerts – Songkick|website=www.songkick.com}}</ref>

His fourth album ''Espiral de Ilusão'', focused on samba, was elected the 6th best Brazilian album of 2017 by the Brazilian edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]]''.<ref name="rsbmelhores2017">{{cite web |title=Melhores Discos Nacionais de 2017 |url=https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/galeria/melhores-discos-nacionais-de-2017/|work=[[Rolling Stone]] Brasil |publisher=Grupo Spring de Comunicação |accessdate=25 January 2019 |date=2017}}</ref> The album was accompanied by the first issue of Criolo magazine and Criolo was awarded best samba singer of the year by Brazilian Music Awards because of it. All his projects since 2010 are released by his record label, Oloko Records, by his manager Beatriz Berjeaut, and his music director, Daniel Ganjaman. 

In 2018, Criolo releases ''Boca de Lobo'' as single and music video (directed by Denis Cisma and Pedro Inoue).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pan-african-music.com/en/criolo-boca-de-lobo/|title=‘Boca de Lobo’: a walk into the wolf’s den with Criolo’s last video about Brazil’s social emergency|last=Sousa|first=Kino|date=2018-10-05|website=Pan African Music|language=en-UK|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> The following year, 2019, he launches the ''Etérea'' project, an electronic beat song made as a homage to the Brazilian underground queer culture. ''Etérea'' music video (directed by Gil Inoue and Gabriel Dietrich) was released with a behind the scenes mini documentary with interviews with the performers and the whole project had creative direction by Tino Monetti and Pedro Inoue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soundsandcolours.com/articles/brazil/criolo-honours-lgbtq-community-latest-song-eterea-44484/|title=Criolo Honours LGBTQ Community with Latest Song 'Etérea'|date=2019-03-11|website=Sounds and Colours|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref> Both singles, with executive production by Kler Correa, were nominated to the Latin Grammy Awards 2019, as Best Music Video, Short Version and Best Song In Portuguese, respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latingrammy.com/es/nominees|title=20a Entrega Anual del Latin GRAMMY|website=Latin GRAMMYs|language=es|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>
