==History==
The Qemists were originally the drummer, bassist and guitarist in a rock band where they spent a lot of time touring UK and Europe as well as spending a lot of time in the studio. During this time in the rock band in the late 1990s, they acquired an interest in [[drum and bass]] and some of the group's early efforts started to get airplay. For many years they were performing in the rock band as their day job whilst producing and DJing [[drum and bass]] at night, and this conflict of interests led to the fusion of the two styles to form The Qemists sound that is known today.
They had previously worked as live sound engineers for [[Basement Jaxx]], [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]] and [[Lady Sovereign]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://musicremedy.com/t/The_Qemists/album/Join_The_Q-6120.html|title=The Qemists 'Join The Q' album - MusicRemedy|date=1 December 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201105403/http://musicremedy.com/t/The_Qemists/album/Join_The_Q-6120.html|archive-date=1 December 2008}}</ref>

Their debut release on [[Ninja Tune]] was a remix of [[Coldcut]]'s "Everything Is Under Control" which was supported by [[Zane Lowe]], [[Coldcut]] and [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ninjatune.net/ninja/artist.php?id=129 |  title=The Qemists at Ninja Tune| access-date=19 March 2009 | author= | publisher=Ninjatune.net}}</ref>

Their first single, "Stompbox", appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Jumper (2008 film)|Jumper]]''.  "Dem Na Like Me" and "Your Revolution" were used in Clay Porter's mountain bike movie ''3 Minute Gaps'' (2011). "Stompbox" and "Tom Cat" appeared in the action movie ''[[Blitz (film)|Blitz (2011)]]''.

In 2009, they supported [[Enter Shikari]] on their World tour, and underwent their own headlining UK tour.
