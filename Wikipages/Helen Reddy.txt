'''Helen Maxine Reddy''' (25 October 1941{{spnd}}29 September 2020) was an Australian-American singer, songwriter, author, actress, and activist. Born in [[Melbourne]], Victoria, to a show-business family, Reddy started her career as an entertainer at age four. She sang on radio and television and won a talent contest on the television program ''[[Bandstand (Australia)|Bandstand]]''{{efn|Not to be confused with Dick Clark's television program ''[[American Bandstand]]''; here ''Bandstand'' refers to the variety program hosted by Australian presenter Brian Henderson.}} in 1966; her prize was a ticket to New York City and a record audition, which was unsuccessful. She pursued her international singing career by moving to Chicago, and subsequently, Los Angeles, where she made her debut singles "[[One Way Ticket (Stephen Lawrence song)|One Way Ticket]]" and "[[I Believe in Music (song)|I Believe in Music]]" in 1968 and 1970, respectively. The B-side of the latter single, "[[I Don't Know How to Love Him (song)|I Don't Know How to Love Him]]", reached number eight on the pop chart of the Canadian magazine ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]''. She was signed to [[Capitol Records]] a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.5356.pdf| title=RPM Top 100 Singles |date=July 4, 1971}}</ref>

During the 1970s, Reddy enjoyed international success, especially in the United States, where she placed 15 singles on the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Six made the top 10 and three reached number one, including her signature hit "[[I Am Woman]]".<ref name="'I am Woman' on australianscreen online">{{cite web| url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/music/i-am-woman/| title='I am Woman' on australianscreen online| website=Aso.gov.au| access-date=3 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seeitlive.com.au/Whats_On/Morning_Melodies_%E2%80%93The_Helen_Reddy_Show |title=Archived copy |access-date=2 November 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210221715/http://www.seeitlive.com.au/Whats_On/Morning_Melodies_%E2%80%93The_Helen_Reddy_Show |archive-date=10 December 2015}}</ref> 
She placed 25 songs on the [[Billboard Adult Contemporary|''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary]] chart; 15 made the top 10 and eight reached number one, six consecutively. In 1974, at the inaugural [[American Music Award]]s, she won the award for [[Favorite Pop/Rock Female Artist]]. On television, she was the first Australian to host a one-hour weekly primetime variety show on an American network, along with specials that were seen in more than 40 countries.<ref name="helenreddy.com">{{cite web| url=http://www.helenreddy.com/flash.html| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717223343/http://www.helenreddy.com/flash.html| url-status=dead| archive-date=17 July 2007| title=The Official Helen Reddy Website| date=17 July 2007}}</ref>

Between the 1980s and 1990s, as her single "[[I Can't Say Goodbye to You]]" became her last to chart in the US, Reddy acted in musicals and recorded albums such as ''[[Center Stage (Helen Reddy album)|Center Stage]]'' before retiring from live performance in 2002. She returned to university in Australia, earned a degree, and practised as a clinical [[hypnotherapist]] and motivational speaker. In 2011, after singing "[[Breezin' Along with the Breeze]]" with her half-sister, [[Toni Lamond]], for Lamond's birthday, Reddy decided to return to live performing.<ref name="helenreddy.com"/>

Reddy's song "[[I Am Woman]]" played a significant role in popular culture, becoming an anthem for [[second-wave feminism]]. She came to be known as a "feminist poster girl" or a "feminist icon".<ref>{{cite journal| last=Arrow| first=Michelle| date=July 2007| title=It Has Become My Personal Anthem: "I Am Woman", Popular Culture and 1970s Feminism| url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233131133| journal=Australian Feminist Studies| volume=22| number=53| pages=213–230| doi=10.1080/08164640701361774| s2cid=143230741}}</ref> 
In 2011, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' named her the number-28 adult contemporary artist of all time (the number-9 woman). In 2013, the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' dubbed her  the "Queen of '70s Pop".<ref name="tribune2013">{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-03-13/entertainment/chi-helen-reddy-20130312_1_happy-birthday-helen-reddy-quiet-life |title=Helen Reddy ready to roar again |work=Chicago Tribune |first=Mark| last=Caro |date=13 March 2013 |access-date= 20 March 2015}}</ref>

Reddy was born during [[World War II]]. Her father was a [[sergeant#Australia|sergeant]] in the [[Australian Army]] with a unit of entertainers; he served alongside one of his actor friends, [[Peter Finch]]. They were serving together in [[New Guinea]] at the time of Reddy's birth.{{sfn|Reddy|2006|p=6}} Her father returned to service during the [[Korean War]].{{sfn|Reddy|2006|pp=48–49}}

At age four, Reddy joined her parents on the Australian [[vaudeville]] circuit, singing and dancing; she recalled: "It was instilled in me: 'You will be a star'. So between the ages of 12 and 17, I got rebellious and decided this was not for me. I was going to be a housewife and mother."<ref name="people.com">{{cite journal |last=Windeler |first=Robert |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064924,00.html |title=Helen Reddy Sings Out for Women's Lib – but Jeffrey Calls the Tune |journal=People |date=3 February 1975 |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref> At age 12, owing to her parents' constant touring nationwide and their arguing, Reddy went to live with her paternal aunt, Helen "Nell" Reddy, "... who was her role model"; as her aunt, "she gave her niece stability, a sense of morality, and strength" for her future career as a singer who motivated women.<ref name="LLC1976">{{cite journal| last1=Murphy| first1=Mary| title=Superstar Women and their Marriage: Reddy and Her Rival| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q-QCAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA25| year=1976| journal=New York| language=en| page=26| access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> The younger Helen's teenaged rebellion in favour of domesticity manifested as marriage to Kenneth Claude Weate, a considerably older musician and family friend; divorce ensued, and to support herself as a single mother to daughter Traci, she resumed her performing career, concentrating on singing, since health problems precluded dancing (she had a kidney removed at 17). She sang on radio and television, eventually winning a talent contest on the Australian pop music TV show [[Bandstand (Australia)|''Bandstand'']], the prize ostensibly being a trip to [[New York City]] to cut a single for [[Mercury Records]]. After arriving in New York in 1966, she was informed by Mercury that her prize was only the chance to "audition" for the label and that Mercury considered the ''Bandstand'' footage to constitute her audition, which was deemed unsuccessful. Despite having only {{US$|200|1966}} and a return ticket to Australia, she decided to remain in the United States with three-year-old Traci and pursue a singing career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/helen-reddy-death-daughter-traci-wald-donat-pays-tribute-to-mother-instagram/a3f7bde0-ce61-481c-9976-cbf7b0cb0bd1|title=Helen Reddy's daughter Traci pays tribute to her trailblazing mother|website=celebrity.nine.com.au}}</ref>

==Music career==
===1966-1968: Early Career===
Reddy recalled her 1966 appearance at the Three Rivers Inn in [[Syracuse, New York]]—"[T]here were like twelve people in the audience"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.classicbands.com/HelenReddyInterview.html |title=Interview With Helen Reddy |website=Classicbands.com |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>—as being typical of her early U.S. performing career. Her lack of a [[work permit]] made it difficult to obtain singing jobs, and she was forced to make trips to Canada, which did not require work permits for citizens of [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. In 1968, [[Martin St James]], an Australian [[stage hypnotist]] she had met in New York City, threw Reddy a party with an admission price of {{US$|5|1968}} to enable Reddy—then down to her last {{US$|12|1968}}—to pay her rent. On this occasion, Reddy met her future manager and husband, Jeff Wald, a 22-year-old secretary at the [[William Morris Agency]] who crashed the party.<ref name="lukeford.net">{{cite web |url=http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/jeff_wald.htm |title=Jeff Wald |website=Lukeford.net |date=3 March 1981 |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref> Reddy told ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' in 1975, "[Wald] didn't pay the five dollars, but it was love at first sight."<ref name="people.com"/>

Wald recalled that  Reddy and he  married three days after meeting, and along with daughter Traci, the couple took up residence at the [[Hotel Albert (New York, New York)|Hotel Albert]] in [[Greenwich Village]].<ref name="lukeford.net" /> Reddy later stated that she married Wald "out of desperation over her right to work and live in the United States."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web |url=http://www.lukeford.net/profiles/profiles/helen_reddy.htm |title=Helen Reddy |website=Lukeford.net |date=4 May 2006 |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref> According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Wald was fired from William Morris soon after having met Reddy, and "Helen supported them for six months doing $35-a-night hospital and charity benefits. They were so broke that they snuck out of a hotel room carrying their clothes in paper bags." Reddy recalled: "When we did eat, it was [[spaghetti]], and we spent what little money we had on cockroach spray."<ref name="people.com"/> They left New York City for [[Chicago]], where Wald landed a job as talent coordinator at [[Mister Kelly's]]. While in Chicago, Reddy gained a reputation singing in local lounges, including Mister Kelly's, and in 1968 she landed a deal with [[Fontana Records]], a division of major-label Chicago-based [[Mercury Records]].<ref name="LLC1976"/> Her first single, "[[One Way Ticket (Stephen Lawrence song)|One Way Ticket]]", on Fontana was not an American hit, but it did give Reddy her first appearance on any chart, as it peaked at number 83 in her native Australia.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.australian-charts.com/forum.asp?todo=viewthread&id=40714| title=australian-charts.com - Forum - 1968 (ARIA Charts: Special Occasion Charts)| first=Steffen| last=Hung| website=Australian-charts.com| access-date=25 May 2018}}</ref>

===1969-1975: "I Am Woman" era and stardom===
[[File:Helen Reddy 1974 (cropped).JPG|thumb|left|Reddy in 1974]]
Within a year, Wald moved Reddy and Traci to Los Angeles, where he was hired at [[Capitol Records]], the label under which Reddy was to attain stardom; however, Wald was hired and fired the same day.<ref name="LLC1976"/> At the same time, in 1969, Reddy enrolled at the [[University of California Los Angeles]] to study psychology and philosophy part-time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theweeklyreview.com.au/meet/1823279-helen-reddy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502211214/https://www.theweeklyreview.com.au/meet/1823279-helen-reddy/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 May 2018 |title=Helen Reddy |last=Wilmoth |first=Peter |publisher=The Weekly Review AU |date=3 May 2012 |access-date=2 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1973/06/24/archives/she-is-woman-she-is-helen-reddy.html |title=She is Woman, She is Helen Reddy |last=Cohn |first=Ellen |work=The New York Times |date=24 June 1973 |access-date=2 May 2018 }}</ref>

Reddy became frustrated as Wald found success managing acts such as [[Deep Purple]] and [[Tiny Tim (musician)|Tiny Tim]] without making any evident effort to promote her; after 18 months of career inactivity, Reddy gave Wald an ultimatum: "he [must] either revitalise her career or get out... Jeff threw himself into his new career as Mr. Helen Reddy. Five months of phone calls to Capitol Records executive Artie Mogull finally paid off; Mogull agreed to let Helen cut one single if Jeff promised not to call for a month. She did "[[I Believe in Music (song)|I Believe in Music]]" penned by [[Mac Davis]] backed with "[[I Don't Know How to Love Him]]" from [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. The A-side fell flat, but then some Canadian DJs flipped the record over and it became a hit – number 13 in June 1971 – and Helen Reddy was on her way."<ref name="LLC1976"/>

Reddy's stardom was solidified when her single "[[I Am Woman]]" reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 in December 1972. The song was co-written by Reddy with [[Ray Burton (musician)|Ray Burton]]; Reddy attributed the impetus for writing "I Am Woman" and her early awareness of the women's movement to expatriate Australian rock critic and pioneer feminist [[Lillian Roxon]]. Reddy is quoted in [[Fred Bronson]]'s ''The ''Billboard'' Book of Number One Hits'' as having said that she was looking for songs to record which reflected the positive self-image she had gained from joining the women's movement but could not find any, so "I realised that the song I was looking for didn't exist, and I was going to have to write it myself."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/music/news/i-am-woman-how-helen-reddys-feminist-anthem-quietly-changed-pop/ar-BB19zOYk|title='I Am Woman': How Helen Reddy's Feminist Anthem Quietly Changed Pop|website=www.msn.com}}</ref>
"I Am Woman" was recorded and released in May 1972 but barely dented the charts. Female listeners soon adopted the song as an anthem and began requesting it from their local radio stations in droves, resulting in its September chart re-entry and eventual number-one peak. "I Am Woman" earned Reddy a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. At the awards ceremony, Reddy concluded her acceptance speech by famously thanking God "because She makes everything possible". The success of "I Am Woman" made Reddy the first Australian singer to top the U.S. charts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-09-30/helen-reddy-dies-in-los-angeles-aged-78/12716886|title=Australian singer Helen Reddy, best known for I Am Woman, dies aged 78|date=30 September 2020|website=ABC News}}</ref>

Three decades after her Grammy, Reddy discussed the song's iconic status: "I think it came along at the right time. I'd gotten involved in the [[feminist movement|women's movement]], and there were a lot of songs on the radio about being weak and being dainty and all those sort of things. All the women in my family, they were strong women. They worked. They lived through the [[The Great Depression|Depression]] and a world war, and they were just strong women. I certainly didn't see myself as being dainty," she said.<ref name="tribune2013"/>

Over the next five years following her first success, Reddy had more than a dozen U.S. top-40 hits, including two more number-one hits. These tracks included [[Kenny Rankin]]'s "[[Peaceful (song)|Peaceful]]" (number 12), the [[Alex Harvey (country musician)|Alex Harvey]] [[Country music|country]] ballad "[[Delta Dawn]]" (number one), [[Linda Laurie]]'s "[[Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)]]" (number three), [[Austin Roberts (singer)|Austin Roberts]]' "[[Keep on Singing]]" (number 15), [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]' "[[You and Me Against the World (song)|You and Me Against the World]]" (featuring daughter Traci reciting the spoken bookends) (number  9), [[Alan O'Day]]'s "[[Angie Baby]]" (number one), [[Véronique Sanson]] and [[Patti Dahlstrom]]'s "[[Emotion (Helen Reddy song)|Emotion]]" (number 22), [[Harriet Schock]]'s "[[Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady]]" (number eight), and the [[Richard Kerr (songwriter)|Richard Kerr]]/[[Will Jennings]]-penned "[[Somewhere in the Night (Helen Reddy song)|Somewhere in the Night]]" (number 19; three years later, a bigger hit for [[Barry Manilow]]).

On 23 July 1974, Reddy received a star, located at 1750 Vine Street, on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] for her work in the music industry.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.walkoffame.com/helen-reddy| title=Helen Reddy |website=Hollywood Walk of Fame| access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/helen-reddy/| title=Helen Reddy – Hollywood Star Walk| newspaper=Los Angeles Times| access-date=4 October 2016}}</ref>

In late 1975, Reddy toured East Asia, Australia and New Zealand and collected 16 gold records, including 6 gold records in Australia and 6 gold records in New Zealand.<ref name="CB Nov 1975">{{cite magazine|url=https://worldradiohistory.com/Archive-All-Music/Cash-Box/70s/1975/CB-1975-11-22.pdf|title=Helen Reddy International Star |magazine=[[Cash Box magazine|Cash Box]]|via=World Radio History|page=unknown|date=22 November 1975|access-date=15 November 2021}}</ref>

At the height of her fame in the mid 1970s, Reddy was a headliner, with a full chorus of backup singers and dancers to standing-room-only crowds on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Among Reddy's opening acts were [[Joan Rivers]], [[David Letterman]], [[Bill Cosby]], and [[Barry Manilow]]. In 1976, Reddy recorded [[the Beatles]]' song "[[The Fool on the Hill]]" for the musical documentary ''[[All This and World War II]]''.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theartofhealing.com.au/Helen-Reddy.html|title=Helen Reddy|website=www.theartofhealing.com.au}}</ref>

Reddy was also instrumental in supporting the career of friend [[Olivia Newton-John]], encouraging her to emigrate from England to the United States in the early 1970s, giving her professional opportunities that did not exist in the United Kingdom. At a party at Reddy's house after a chance meeting with [[Allan Carr]], a film producer, Newton-John won the starring role in the hit film version of the musical ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last=Watters |first=Jim |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/06/11/archives/olivia-newtonjohn-not-really-the-girl-next-door-olivia-newtonjohn.html |title=Olivia Newton-John: Not Really the 'Girl Next Door' |work=The New York Times |date=11 June 1978 |access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref>

===1976-1990: Career decline===
Reddy was most successful on the [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Easy Listening chart]], scoring eight number-one hits there over a three-year span, from "Delta Dawn" in 1973 to "[[I Can't Hear You No More]]" in 1976. However, the latter track evidenced a sharp drop in popularity for Reddy, with a number-29 peak on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Reddy's 1977 remake of [[Cilla Black]]'s 1964 hit "[[You're My World]]" indicated comeback potential, with a number-18 peak, but this track – co-produced by [[Kim Fowley]] – would prove to be Reddy's last top-40 hit. Its source album, ''[[Ear Candy (Helen Reddy album)|Ear Candy]]'', Reddy's 10th album, became her first album to not attain at least [[RIAA certification|gold status]] since her second full-length release, 1972's ''[[Helen Reddy (album)|Helen Reddy]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gold & Platinum search|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=helen+reddy#search_section|access-date=2020-10-03|website=RIAA}}</ref>

In 1978, Reddy sang as a backup singer on [[Gene Simmons]]'s solo album on the song "True Confessions".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theoaklandpress.com/entertainment/helen-reddy-biopic-i-am-woman-roars-onto-screens/article_8da564fa-f2d9-11ea-ac2e-8710929fc39e.html|title=Helen Reddy biopic "I Am Woman" roars onto screens|first=Gary Graff ggraff@medianewsgroup com; @GraffonMusic on|last=Twitter|website=The Oakland Press}}</ref> That year also saw the release of Reddy's only live album, ''[[Live in London (Helen Reddy album)|Live in London]],'' recorded at the [[London Palladium]].

Of Reddy's eight subsequent single releases on Capitol, five reached the Easy Listening top 50 – including "[[Candle on the Water]]", from the 1977 Disney film ''[[Pete's Dragon (1977 film)|Pete's Dragon]]'' (which starred Reddy). Only three ranked on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100: "The Happy Girls" (number 57) – the follow-up to "You're My World", and besides "I Am Woman", Reddy's only chart item that she co-wrote – and the disco tracks "Ready or Not" (number 73) and "Make Love to Me" (number 60), the latter a cover of an Australian hit by [[Kelly Marie]], which gave Reddy a lone R&B chart ranking at number 59. Reddy also made it to number 98 on the [[Hot Country Songs|Country chart]] with "Laissez les bon Temps Rouler", the B-side to "The Happy Girls".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Helen Reddy|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/helen-reddy/chart-history/CSI|access-date=2020-10-03|website=Billboard}}</ref>

Without the impetus of any major hits, Reddy's four Capitol album releases subsequent to ''Ear Candy'' failed to chart. In 1981, Reddy said: "I signed [with Capitol] ten years ago...And when you are with a company so long you tend to be taken for granted.

May 1981 had the release of ''[[Play Me Out (Helen Reddy album)|Play Me Out]]'', Reddy's debut album for [[MCA Records]], which Reddy said had "made me a deal we [Reddy and Wald] couldn't refuse"; "we shopped around and felt the most enthusiasm at MCA."<ref name="Billboard"/>  Reddy's new label affiliation, though, would result in only one minor success; her remake of [[Becky Hobbs]]'s 1979 country hit "I Can't Say Goodbye to You" returned her for the last time to the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 at number 88; it also returned Reddy to the charts in the UK and Ireland (her sole previous hit in both was "Angie Baby"). Reddy's 14 November 1981 ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' performance brought "I Can't Say Goodbye to You" into the UK top 50; the track would rise there no higher than number 43, but in Ireland reached number 16, giving Reddy her final high placing on a major national chart. MCA released one further Reddy album: ''[[Imagination (Helen Reddy album)|Imagination]]'', in 1983; it would prove to be Reddy's final release as a career recording artist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/arts/music/helen-reddy-dead.html|title=Helen Reddy Dies at 78; Sang 'I Am Woman'|first=Anita|last=Gates|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 September 2020}}</ref>

The unsuccessful ''Imagination'' was released just after the finalisation of Reddy's divorce from Wald, whose alleged subsequent interference in her career Reddy blamed for the decline of her career profile in the mid-1980s: "Several of my performing contracts were cancelled, and one promoter told me he couldn't book me in case a certain someone 'came after him with a shotgun'."<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Reddy states that she was effectively being blacklisted from her established performance areas, which led to her pursuing a career in theatre, where Wald had no significant influence.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/culture/music/helen-reddy-the-roaring-sound-of-feminism-20200930-p560j4.html|title=Helen Reddy, the roaring sound of feminism|first=John|last=Shand|date=30 September 2020|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}</ref>

===1990s-2000: Later recordings===
In 1990, Reddy issued ''[[Feel So Young]]'' on her own label{{snd}}an album that includes remakes of Reddy's repertoire favourites. Meanwhile, her one recording in the interim had been the 1987 [[12" single|dance maxisingle]] "Mysterious Kind", on which Reddy had vocally supported Jessica Williams. The 1997 release of ''[[Center Stage (Helen Reddy album)|Center Stage]]'' was an album of show tunes that Reddy recorded for [[Varèse Sarabande]]; the track "Surrender"{{snd}}originating in ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''{{snd}}was remixed for release as a dance maxisingle. Reddy's final album was the 2000 seasonal release ''The Best Christmas Ever''. In April 2015, Reddy released a cover of The Beatles' "[[All You Need Is Love]]" for the album ''Keep Calm and Salute The Beatles'' on the [[Purple Pyramid]] label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://secondhandsongs.com/performance/370710/versions |title=Cover versions of All You Need Is Love by Helen Reddy |website=SecondHandSongs.com |access-date=19 August 2016}}</ref>

===2002-2010: retirement===

Reddy announced her retirement from performing in 2002, giving her farewell performance with the [[Edmonton Symphony Orchestra]]. The same year, she moved from her longtime residence in [[Santa Monica, California]], back to her native Australia to spend time with her family, living first on [[Norfolk Island]]<ref>{{cite web| work=[[Probus Clubs|Probus South Pacific]]| url=https://www.probussouthpacific.org/557045e8/Helen_Reddy_My_island_home| title=Helen Reddy: My island home| first=Fiona| last=Baker| access-date=17 April 2014| date=12 April 2013}}</ref> before taking up residence in [[Sydney]].<ref name="auto"/>

She also earned a degree in clinical [[hypnotherapy]] and [[neuro-linguistic programming|neurolinguistic programming]]. She was a practicing clinical hypnotherapist and patron of the Australian Society of Clinical Hypnotherapists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Helen Reddy Wants to Help On and Off the Stage|url=https://www.theatermania.com/san-francisco-theater/news/interview-helen-reddy-wants-to-help-on-and-off-the_60173.html|website=theatermania.com|date=August 3, 2012|access-date=2020-09-30}}</ref><ref name="auto1"/>

At a ceremony in August 2006, Reddy was inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] by actress singer, [[Toni Collette]], who described her song, "I Am Woman", as "timeless." The song was performed by fellow Australian, [[Vanessa Amorosi]].<ref name="Adams Aug2006">{{cite web | url = http://ntnews.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,7034,20156660%255E10388,00.html | title = ARIA Hall of Fame honours rock greats | author = Adams, Cameron | work = [[Northern Territory News]] | date = 17 August 2006 | via = [[National Library of Australia]] | archive-url = https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20060822093125/http://ntnews.news.com.au/common/story_page/0,7034,20156660%255E10388,00.html | archive-date = 22 August 2006 | access-date = 13 September 2020 }}</ref>

In April 2008, Reddy was reported to be living "simply and frugally off song royalties, pension funds, and social security...[renting] a 13th-floor apartment with a 180° view of [[Sydney Harbour]]."<ref name="USA Today"/> Her apartment had been recently appraised, causing Reddy concern over its future affordability; however, the New York-based landlord learned his tenant's identity and wrote her: "I had no idea it was ''the'' Helen Reddy who was living in my unit. Because of what you have done for millions of women all over the world, I will not sell or raise your rent. I hope you'll be very happy living there for years to come."<ref name="USA Today"/>

For several years, Reddy maintained that she would not return to the stage. In 2008, she stated, "It's not going to happen. I've moved on," and explained that her voice had deepened to a lower key and she wasn't sure if she would be able to sing some of her hits. She also said she had simply lost interest in performing. "I have very wide-ranging interests," she said. "So, singing 'Leave Me Alone' 43 times per song lost its charm a long time ago."<ref name="USA Today">{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2008-04-16-helen-reddy_N.htm |title=Singer Helen Reddy is now a writer and a speaker |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |access-date=6 July 2010 | first=William |last=Keck | date=16 April 2008}}</ref>

===2011-2020: Brief comeback to concerts===
In 2011, Reddy decided to return to performing after being buoyed by the warm reception she received when she sang at her sister's 80th birthday party. "I hadn't heard my voice in 10 years, and when I heard it coming over the speaker, it was like: 'Oh, that’s not bad. Maybe I should do that again,'" Reddy explained in 2013.<ref name="tribune2013"/>

Being more in control of her performances also appealed to Reddy, who said, "I have more leeway in the songs that I choose to sing. I'm not locked into what the record company wants."<ref name="tribune2013"/> She explained, "One of the reasons that I'm coming back to singing is because I'm not doing the greatest hits. I'm doing the songs that I always loved. So many are album cuts that never got any airplay, and they're gorgeous songs."<ref name="cbs">{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/singer-helen-reddy-emerges-from-retirement/| title=Helen Reddy comes out of retirement| work=[[CBS News]]| date=13 July 2012| access-date=20 March 2015 }}</ref> She also performed many of her best-known songs, including, "[[Angie Baby]]," "[[You and Me Against the World (song)|You and Me Against the World]]", a medley of "[[Delta Dawn]]"/"Ain't No Way to Treat a Lady," and "[[I Am Woman]]," reasoning on the latter that the audience "comes to hear" it.<ref name="tribune2013"/>

She said she refused to sing "[[Leave Me Alone (Ruby Red Dress)]]" because she disliked the monotony of the repeated chorus. "They used to have a contest on the radio that you could get two free tickets to Helen Reddy's show if you could tell us how many times she sang "leave me alone". I think it was like 42 times," she said.<ref name="tribune2013"/>

Reddy appeared in downtown Los Angeles at the [[2017 Women's March]] on 21 January. The march for women's rights and unity following the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]] brought out 750,000 people. Reddy was introduced by actress [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] and sang an ''[[a cappella]]'' version of "I Am Woman".<ref>[http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2017/01/21/protesters-pour-into-downtown-la-trains-jammed/ "Protesters Pour Into Downtown LA For Women’s March"], [[KCBS-TV|KCBS News]], 21 January 2017.</ref><ref>{{YouTube|oXwfEZTLG6Q|Helen Reddy at the 2017 Women's March ("I Am Woman")}}</ref>

In September 1981, Reddy announced she would be shooting the pilot for her own TV sitcom, in which she would play a single mother working as a lounge singer in [[Lake Tahoe]],<ref name="Billboard"/> but this project was abandoned.

Reddy was an enthusiastic [[genealogist]]; she researched her family's history extensively and founded the Tasmanian Genealogical Society.<ref name="washpost2006"/> "Genealogy is addictive; it begins as an interest, becomes a hobby, then a passion, and finally an obsession. Not only with each generation uncovered does the number of people to investigate double, but so too does the desire to understand the forces that shaped them," she wrote in her autobiography.{{sfn|Reddy|2006|pp=173–174}} Reddy was once asked in an interview whether her name had any connection to the [[Reddy]] [[caste]] from [[India]]. Her response was: "I have done some research on my father's side; most of my research has been done on my mother's side. His father was born in Ireland, but his great-grandfather served with an Irish regiment stationed in India, so it is possible that I have Indian ancestry.

In a 1975 ''People'' interview, Reddy admitted that her relationship with then-husband and manager Wald was volatile, with the couple having "huge, healthy fights", but that she owed her success (she was then the world's biggest-selling female vocalist for two consecutive years) to Wald: "He runs it all.
