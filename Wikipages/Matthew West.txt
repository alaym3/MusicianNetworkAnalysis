'''Matthew Joseph West'''<ref name="mtv">{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/lyrics/williams_joy/hide/13194541/lyrics.jhtml |title=Hide Lyrics {{!}} Joy Williams |publisher=[[MTV]].com |access-date=July 5, 2008}}</ref> (born April 25, 1977) is an American [[contemporary Christian music]]ian, singer-songwriter, and actor. He has released five studio albums and is known for his songs, "[[More (Matthew West song)|More]]", "[[You Are Everything (Matthew West song)|You Are Everything]]", and "[[The Motions (Matthew West song)|The Motions]]". He was nominated for five [[GMA Dove Award|Dove Awards]] in 2005, two of which were for his major label debut album, ''[[Happy (Matthew West album)|Happy]]''. West won the 2013 American Music Award for Best Contemporary Inspirational Artist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/complete-winners-list-highlights-2013-american-music-awards/story?id=20996929 |title=Complete Winners' List and Highlights of the 2013 American Music Awards - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=November 24, 2013 |access-date=December 2, 2013}}</ref>

Starting as an [[independent music]]ian in the late 1990s, he released three independent albums before signing with [[Universal South Records]]. With the release of his Dove Award-winning debut album, ''Happy'', released in 2003, his first radio single, "More", stayed at No. 1 on Christian [[Adult Contemporary]] charts for nine weeks and received two Dove Award nominations. His second album, ''[[History (Matthew West album)|History]]'', was followed by a 2006 re-release of the originally independent album, ''Sellout''. In 2007, he faced vocal issues that threatened his career with two months of prescribed [[vocal rest]]. His third studio album, ''[[Something to Say (Matthew West album)|Something to Say]]'', also enjoyed chart success with No. 1 hits, "You Are Everything" and "The Motions".

In addition to his main solo career, West has worked as a songwriter for many Christian musicians and groups such as [[Point of Grace]], [[Mandisa]], [[Natalie Grant]], and [[Casting Crowns]], as well as mainstream country acts, [[Rascal Flatts]], [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], and [[Vince Gill]]. In 2013, his second single, "Hello, My Name Is", from the album, ''[[Into the Light (Matthew West album)|Into the Light]]'', was released and reached at No.&nbsp;1 for a career-best 17 consecutive weeks on the ''Billboard'' Christian Songs chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/310078/matthew-west/chart?f=355 |title=Matthew West - Chart history |publisher=Billboard |access-date=December 2, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://matthewwest.com/post_updates/17-weeks-at-1-for-hello-my-name-is-a-new-record/ |title=17 Weeks at No. 1 for "HELLO MY NAME IS" – A NEW RECORD! |publisher=Matthew West |access-date=December 2, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110081339/http://matthewwest.com/post_updates/17-weeks-at-1-for-hello-my-name-is-a-new-record/ |archive-date=November 10, 2013  }}</ref>

== Early life ==

Matthew West was born on April 25, 1977 in [[Downers Grove, Illinois]].<ref name="JFH-disc">{{cite web |url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/artists/MatthewWest.asp |title=Matthew West Discography |publisher=Jesus Freak Hideout |access-date=June 27, 2008}}</ref><ref name="breathecast-StS">{{cite web |url=http://www.breathecast.com/Christian.Music.Artist-Matthew.West/Article-237_1935.htm |title=Matthew West Gives Critics and Fans Something to Say |publisher=BREATHEcast.com |date=January 25, 2008 |access-date=July 1, 2008}}</ref> As a child he was a fan of his hometown [[baseball]] team, the [[Chicago Cubs]], and wanted to eventually have a career in baseball.<ref name="2004 interview">{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/music/interviews/2004/matthewwest-0304.html |title=Staying in the Game |work=[[Christianity Today|Christian Music Today]] |date=March 15, 2004 |access-date=June 30, 2008}}</ref> He played baseball throughout high school at [[Downers Grove North High School]], becoming team captain as a senior. He was hoping for a college baseball scholarship but instead ended up receiving a four-year music scholarship at [[Millikin University]] in [[Decatur, Illinois]] where he was a part of the [[InterVarsity Christian Fellowship]] chapter. He graduated from Millikin in 1999.<ref name="2004 interview" />

== Musical career ==

West wrote most of his first songs in the sanctuary of his father's church while he was at home during college breaks.<ref name="2004 interview" /> According to a statement by West at the 2013 Winter Jam (March 23, 2013): at a 1997 Steven Curtis Chapman concert at the Assembly Hall in Champaign, Urbana, West has said that he was crying profusely, making his friends ask him what was wrong.  He said that he was being led by Jesus to pursue a career in singing and
songwriting.
He was a songwriter and [[independent music]]ian from 1997 to 2002, releasing three albums: ''September Sun'' (1997), ''Every Step of the Way'' (1998), and ''Sellout'' (2002).<ref name="emicmg">{{cite web|url=http://pressroom.emicmg.com/artists/MatthewWest/files/uploads/filedownloads/Matthew%20CutxCutfinal.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060918154447/http://pressroom.emicmg.com/artists/MatthewWest/files/uploads/filedownloads/Matthew%20CutxCutfinal.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 18, 2006 |title=Matthew West History.

Just before graduating from Millikin University in 1999, someone from the college recommended that West attend the [[Gospel Music Association|GMA]] [[Music in the Rockies]] event for aspiring musicians. Although West was not interested at first, he attended after learning that other people signed him up and paid his entrance fee.<ref name="2004 interview" /> He met a representative from Word Publishing at the event who took interest in him and kept in contact until he graduated. West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition and was offered a songwriting deal in July 1999, five weeks after graduating.<ref name="2004 interview" /><ref name="emicmg" /> After penning songs for well-known musicians like [[Billy Ray Cyrus]] and [[Rachael Lampa]], he began touring the United States as an independent artist in 2000 and 2001.<ref name="2004 interview" /><ref name="emicmg" />

On July 26, 2002,<ref name="emicmg" /> only a week or two before signing a record contract with [[Universal South Records]], West had an injury to his left arm which threatened his musical career and guitar playing. He says, "I locked myself out of my house. But I'd done that before, and I had a way of breaking in through a window. But this time, I had a really hard time getting the window open. I started pushing up on the window really hard and my hand broke through the glass. Blood starting spewing out of my left arm everywhere and I ran down my street screaming for help. After seeing so much blood, I went into shock and just blacked out in the middle of the street. The next thing I can remember is some construction workers praying over me in Spanish and then being taken to the hospital."<ref name="2004 interview" /> West was told that the chances were low of regaining the full use of his left arm, having come very close to severing a major artery.<ref name="2004 interview" /> He recovered after the accident, however, and was able to continue playing guitar and record for his first studio album.<ref name="1cubed">{{cite web |url=http://1cubed.com/display.php?ID=171&sectionID=26 |title=Matthew West – Biography, Interviews and Music Interviews |publisher=1cubed.com |access-date=July 7, 2008}}</ref>

"The first day, I got 1,000 stories. All of a sudden, I was like, 'holy cow, something special is about to take place'. I rented a cabin in Tennessee, about 25 minutes from my house that felt like it was out in the middle of nowhere. And I spent two months in that cabin reading 10,000 stories," the singer/songwriter reported in an interview with CBN.com.<ref>[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/interviews/matthew-west-the-story-of-your-life-goodwyn.aspx Matthew West on ''The Story of Your Life'': An in-depth interview."], ''CBN.com''.</ref> Matthew is also starring in ''The Heart of Christmas''.<ref>[http://www.christiancinema.com/catalog/newsdesk_info.php?newsdesk_id=1902 Original Christmas Film THE HEART OF CHRISTMAS debuts on GMC TV], ''ChristianCinema.com''</ref>
