'''Apocalyptica''' is a Finnish [[symphonic metal]] band from [[Helsinki]], formed in 1993. The band is composed of classically trained [[cellists]] [[Eicca Toppinen]], [[Paavo Lötjönen]], and [[Perttu Kivilaakso]], and jazz drummer Mikko Sirén. Originally a [[Classical music|classical-style]] [[Metallica]] tribute band, the band eventually adopted a [[neoclassical metal]] style without the use of conventional guitars and bass.<ref name="wordscollide"/> They have sold over four million albums to date.<ref name="Blabbermouth.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=141115 |title=APOCALYPTICA: New Album Artwork Revealed |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205509/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=141115 |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Apocalyptica logo.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|The band's logo]]
A [[cello]] [[String quartet|quartet]], [[Eicca Toppinen]], [[Paavo Lötjönen]], [[Max Lilja]], and [[Antero Manninen]] formed Apocalyptica in 1993 at [[Sibelius Academy]] in Helsinki, Finland.<ref name="apocalyptica.apocello.ru">{{cite web|url=http://apocalyptica.apocello.ru/press/faceculture-mikko-eicca-2007-en.php |title=Interview with Mikko and Eicca for FaceCulture.nl 2007 |website=Apocalyptica.apocello.ru |access-date=20 October 2011}}</ref> The band released their debut [[studio album]], ''[[Plays Metallica by Four Cellos]]'', in 1996.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=32}}</ref> The album consisted of only eight Metallica covers (mostly from ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' and their [[Metallica (album)|self-titled ''The Black Album'']]). The band was featured on two songs on the [[Waltari]] album ''[[Space Avenue]]'' in 1997. Apocalyptica released their second studio album, ''[[Inquisition Symphony (album)|Inquisition Symphony]]'', produced by [[Hiili Hiilesmaa]] in 1998. ''Inquisition Symphony'' contained covers of Metallica and other metal bands such as [[Faith No More]], [[Sepultura]], and [[Pantera]]. It also contained three original songs by Eicca Toppinen.

[[Antero Manninen]] left the group in 1999 and was replaced by [[Perttu Kivilaakso]]. Perttu had previously performed with the band in 1995. Apocalyptica released their third studio album, ''[[Cult (Apocalyptica album)|Cult]]'', in 2000. It featured mostly original songs and three cover songs. The first Apocalyptica track to include vocals, "[[Path Vol.2|Path Vol. 2]]", sung by [[Sandra Nasić|Sandra Nasic]] of [[Guano Apes]], was released shortly after ''Cult''. Max Lilja left the group in 2002 and joined [[Hevein (band)|Hevein]].

Apocalyptica released their fourth studio album, ''[[Reflections (Apocalyptica album)|Reflections]]'', in 2003, containing only original songs. ''Reflections'' featured an experimental sound different from the acoustic arrangements of ''Inquisition Symphony'' and ''Cult''. [[Dave Lombardo]] from [[Slayer]] played drums on five songs from ''Reflections.'' Session drummer [[Sami Kuoppamäki]] covered the rest. When Lombardo declined the following tour, Apocalyptica hired Mikko Sirén, who would stay with the band for future tours as well as the recording of the next album.

Apocalyptica released their [[Apocalyptica (album)|self-titled fifth studio album]] in 2005 which featured [[Ville Valo]] of [[HIM (Finnish band)|HIM]], [[Lauri Ylönen]] of [[the Rasmus]], and Dave Lombardo, returning from the previous album.

Apocalyptica was on the track "Intro" from [[Bullet for My Valentine]]'s album ''[[The Poison]]'' in 2005.  The group performed with [[Marta Jandová]] and represented [[Baden-Württemberg]] in the [[Bundesvision Song Contest 2005]] with the song "Wie weit", placing 5th with 77 points.<ref name="fan-lexikon">{{cite web|url=http://www.fan-lexikon.de/film-tv/bundesvision-song-contest/|title=Bundesvision Song Contest|work=fan-lexikon.de|language=de|access-date=19 April 2015}}</ref> Mikko Sirén became an official band member in December 2005 having played around 200 shows with the band.

Apocalyptica released their sixth studio album, ''[[Worlds Collide (Apocalyptica album)|Worlds Collide]]'', on 17 September 2007. It was produced by [[Jacob Hellner]]. To the surprise of many, the album includes a remake of the German version of [[David Bowie]]'s song "[[Heroes (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]". [[Till Lindemann]] of [[Rammstein]], for whom they opened on the ''Reise, Reise'' tour, was the guest vocalist on the track "Helden".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rammsteinworld.com/live/anciennes-tournees/reise-reise-tour|title=Rammstein World - Reise, Reise tour|website=Rammstein World|language=fr-FR|access-date=5 June 2018}}</ref>  ''[[Worlds Collide (Apocalyptica album)|Worlds Collide]]'' was released on 15 April 2008 in the United States. The first single, "[[I'm Not Jesus]]" featuring [[Corey Taylor]] of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and [[Stone Sour]], cracked the top 10 of both the [[Active rock]] and [[Alternative rock]] charts.

To end 2007, the band toured Europe, continuing in 2008 in the United States and included numerous festivals in Europe.

In June 2008, during the [[Rock in Rio]] concert in Lisbon, Apocalyptica joined the [[Greenpeace]] "energy [r]evolution campaign" and played the [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Beethoven 5th symphony]] from the stage.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJ6At2GmDbI |title=Apocalyptica supports Greenpeace campaign.

The band also appeared on ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]'' on 31 October 2008. Here they made their American television debut with a performance of "I Don't Care" with [[Toryn Green]].

In November 2008, Apocalyptica featuring [[Adam Gontier]] of [[Three Days Grace]] hit first at the BDS and Mediabase Active Rock radio charts with the single "[[I Don't Care (Apocalyptica song)|I Don't Care]]". Later that month, the band ranked 3rd on Billboard's Hot Modern Rock Track chart and 2nd on Billboard's Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart just after [[AC/DC]] and just ahead of [[Metallica]], an ironic twist since the band's origins lie in performing Metallica covers. Recently, it reached No. 1 on the Billboard rock chart, making Apocalyptica the first Finnish band to top the US charts. The song "I Don't Care" was also featured in the 16th episode of Season 8 of the TV series ''[[Smallville]]'', which aired on 19 March 2009.

The seventh Apocalyptica studio album entitled ''[[7th Symphony (album)|7th Symphony]]'', produced by [[Joe Barresi]] and [[Howard Benson]], was released on 23 August 2010 in Europe (Germany on 20 August 2010),<ref name="metalfinland">"[http://www.metalfromfinland.com/news/2010-05-06_08:26/apocalyptica_set_release_date_for_7th_symphony_first_single_announced Apocalyptica Set Release Date For 7th Symphony; First Single Announced] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618085829/http://www.metalfromfinland.com/news/2010-05-06_08%3A26/apocalyptica_set_release_date_for_7th_symphony_first_single_announced/ |date=18 June 2010 }}" ''MetalFromFinland.com'' 6 May 2010.</ref> and 24 August in the U.S.<ref name="prnews">"[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/apocalyptica-prepare-for-new-album-with-us-tour-93089494.html Apocalyptica Prepare for New album with U.S. Tour]" PR Newswire 7 May 2010.</ref> The first single aired on radio 29 June 2010.<ref name="prnews"/>

On 7 October 2011, [[RCA Music Group]] announced it was disbanding [[Jive Records]] along with [[Arista Records]] and [[J Records]].  With the shutdown, the band (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release their future material on the [[RCA Records]] brand.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-new-executive-team-named-under-ceo-1005324782.story |title=RCA's New Executive Team Named Under CEO Peter Edge Amid Layoffs (Update) |work=Billboard |date=23 August 2011 |access-date=20 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707 |title=Radio Industry News, Music Industry Updates, Arbitron Ratings, Music News and more! |website=Fmqb.com|access-date=20 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108044953/http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707 |archive-date=8 November 2011 }}</ref>

There were two live performances in Wagner's birth town [[Leipzig]], Germany on 5 and 6 July 2013.
