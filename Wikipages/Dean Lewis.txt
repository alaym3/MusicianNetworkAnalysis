As a song writer, who also sings, the entire concept just felt foreign. Until I met Martin. We spent about a week together locked behind closed doors in Amsterdam working on a song, which thought might end up be sung by someone else. But as the track progressed is started to sound a lot like me, but also very Martin. It's a real collaboration with a guy who's now become a great friend".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://weraveyou.com/2019/10/martin-garrix-dean-lewis-used-to-love/|title=Martin Garrix & Dean Lewis – Used To Love|last=Todoroski|first=About the Author / James|date=2019-10-31|website=We Rave You|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191118013640/https://weraveyou.com/2019/10/martin-garrix-dean-lewis-used-to-love/|archive-date=18 November 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> An acoustic version of the song was released in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dancingastronaut.com/2020/02/martin-garrix-strips-down-used-to-love-in-acoustic-rendition-stream/|title=Martin Garrix strips down "Used to Love" in acoustic rendition [Stream]|last=Narozniak|first=Rachel|date=16 February 2020|website=[[Dancing Astronaut]]|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref>
