'''Divinyls''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|ˈ|v|aɪ|n|əl|z}}) were an Australian [[Rock music|rock]] band that were formed in Sydney in 1980. The band primarily consisted of vocalist [[Chrissy Amphlett]] and guitarist [[Mark McEntee]]. Amphlett garnered widespread attention for performing on stage in a school uniform and fishnet stockings, and often used an illuminated neon tube as a prop for displaying aggression towards both band members and the audience.<ref name="McF">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofau00mcfa |last=McFarlane |first=Ian |author-link=Ian McFarlane |publisher=[[Allen & Unwin]] |year=1999 |isbn=1-86448-768-2 |access-date=30 May 2008 |url-access=registration }}</ref><ref name=pleasure>{{cite book

==Career==
===1980s: Formation, ''Desperate'', ''What a Life!'' & ''Temperamental''===
Amphlett was the cousin of 1960s Australian pop icon [[Little Pattie|Patricia "Little Pattie" Amphlett]], who had been married to Keith Jacobsen—younger brother of pioneer rocker [[Col Joye]] and leading promoter [[Kevin Jacobsen]].<ref name="McF"/><ref name="LittlePattie">{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1838867.htm|title=Patricia Amphlett – Little Pattie|work=Talking Heads with Peter Thompson – transcripts|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC)|date=12 February 2007|access-date=24 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003224230/http://www.abc.net.au/talkingheads/txt/s1838867.htm|archive-date=3 October 2009|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> In her autobiography ''Pleasure and Pain'' (2005), Amphlett described breaking into the music scene from the age of fourteen, being arrested for [[busking]] when seventeen and travelling in Spain, and how her performances drew upon childhood pain.<ref name="Chrissie">{{cite book |last=Amphlett |first=Christina |author2=Larry Writer |date=November 2005 |title=Pleasure and Pain: My Life |location=Sydney |publisher=Hachette Livre Australia |isbn=0-7336-1959-2 }}</ref>

Amphlett and guitarist Mark McEntee were introduced by Jeremy Paul (ex-[[Air Supply]]) in the car park of a small music venue in [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]], Sydney, after Amphlett and Paul had finished a gig with their then band, Batonrouge. Amphlett and McEntee met again at the [[Sydney Opera House]] where Amphlett and Paul were singing in a choral concert in 1980.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Chrissie"/><ref name="Howl">{{cite web |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/nph-wb/20010328130000/http://www.howlspace.com.au/en/divinyls/divinyls.htm |url=http://www.whiteroom.com.au/howlspace/en/divinyls/divinyls.htm |title=The Divinyls |publisher=Howlspace |editor=Ed Nimmervoll |editor-link=Ed Nimmervoll |archive-date=28 March 2001 |access-date=22 January 2014 }}</ref> They recruited keyboardist Bjarne Ohlin later in 1980 and drummer Richard Harvey in 1981, respectively,<ref name="ARDb">{{cite web | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121222074952/http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/d/divinyls.html | url = http://hem.passagen.se/honga/database/d/divinyls.html | title = Divinyls | last1 = Holmgren | first1 = Magnus | first2 = Paul | last2 = Baird | publisher = [[Australian Rock Database]].

During this time, Paul negotiated publishing and recording agreements that led to the band signing with WEA. Australian film director Ken Cameron saw Divinyls performing in a club. This led to them providing the soundtrack for his 1982 film ''[[Monkey Grip (film)|Monkey Grip]]'' and also gave Amphlett, Paul and McEntee supporting roles in the movie.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084350/ |title=''Monkey Grip'' at Internet Movie Database (IMDb) |website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=31 May 2008 }}</ref> The group released two singles from the soundtrack, ''[[Monkey Grip (soundtrack)|Music from Monkey Grip]]'' [[Extended play|EP]],<ref name="Monk">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0084350/soundtrack |title=''Monkey Grip'' Soundtrack at IMDb |website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=31 May 2008 }}</ref> "[[Boys in Town (song)|Boys in Town]]", which reached No.&nbsp;8 on the national singles chart,<ref name="Kent">{{cite book|title=Kent Music Report |last=Kent|first=David|author-link=David Kent (historian)|publisher=Australian Chart Book|location=[[St Ives, New South Wales|St Ives]], N.S.W.|year=1993|isbn=0-646-11917-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7--JAAAACAAJ&q=0646119176 |access-date=15 May 2014}}</ref> and "Only Lonely".<ref name="McF"/> The band was the opening act at the [[US Festival#Memorial Day Weekend, 1983|1983 US Festival]].

Over the decade Divinyls released four albums, ''Music from Monkey Grip'' EP on [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in 1982, ''[[Desperate (Divinyls album)|Desperate]]'' on [[Chrysalis Records]] in 1983, ''[[What a Life!

Divinyls also had Australian hits with [[cover version]]s of [[The Easybeats]]' "I'll Make You Happy", and [[Syndicate of Sound]]'s "[[Hey Little Boy]]" ("Hey Little Girl" with the gender switched) which reached No.&nbsp;25 in 1988.<ref name="Kent"/> Amphlett became a controversial and highly visible celebrity for her brash, overtly sexual persona and subversive humour in lyrics, performances and media interviews.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="ARIA2006"/><ref name="RS">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/100352/review/5945841/divinyls |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123203647/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/100352/review/5945841/divinyls |url-status=dead |archive-date=23 November 2007 |title=''Divinyls'' album review |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |last=Farber |first=Jim |year=1992 |access-date=31 May 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/divinyls.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020809234517/http://www.80smusiclyrics.com/artists/divinyls.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 August 2002 |title=The Divinyls: Best Music from the 80s |website=80smusiclyrics.com |access-date=31 May 2008 }}</ref>

===Image transformation===
At the start of their popularity, Divinyls were considered to be a [[hard rock]] band. At some point, many fans referred to Amphlett as the female [[Angus Young]], as both had similar mannerisms on stage and wore black-and-white school uniforms while performing in the early 1980s. The band's image gradually changed after the release of the album ''What a Life!'' when the band began wearing elaborate clothing and producing more songs in the pop music genre. By the time of the release of their album ''Temperamental'', Divinyls' image had changed to a [[glamour (presentation)|glamour]] fashion style where they produced modern pop music.

===1990s: ''diVINYLS'' & ''Underworld''===
In 1991, Divinyls released ''[[Divinyls (album)|diVINYLS]]'' on [[Virgin Records]] and the single "[[I Touch Myself]]" which became their only Australian No.1 single.<ref name="OzCharts">{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Divinyls |title=Divinyls discography |publisher=australian-charts.com |access-date=31 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202120532/http://australian-charts.com/showinterpret.asp?interpret=Divinyls |archive-date=2 February 2009 |df=dmy }}</ref> The song reached No.&nbsp;4 in the United States and No.&nbsp;10 in the United Kingdom.

A disagreement with Virgin Records stifled future development outside Australia where they released popular albums and achieved two more top twenty singles with "[[I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore]]" No.&nbsp;19 in 1992 and "[[I'm Jealous]]" No.&nbsp;14 in 1995.<ref name="Kent"/> During the 1980s and 1990s Amphlett collaborated as a songwriter with other artists including [[Chrissie Hynde]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]], and both Amphlett and McEntee worked on solo projects.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/>

A live album, ''Divinyls Live'', was released in 1991 but Divinyls did not provide another studio album for five years. In the early 1990s, they recorded a series of cover songs for various movie soundtracks, including the [[The Rascals|Young Rascals]]' "[[I Ain't Gonna Eat Out My Heart Anymore]]" for ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' (1992), the Wild Ones' "[[Wild Thing (The Troggs song)|Wild Thing]]" for ''[[Reckless Kelly]]'' (1993), and [[Roxy Music]]'s "[[Love Is the Drug]]" for ''[[Super Mario Bros. (film)|Super Mario Brothers]]'' (1993).<ref name="McF"/><ref name="IMDbCA">{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0025353/ |title=Chrissy Amphlett at Internet Movie Database (IMDb) |website=[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=31 May 2008}}</ref>

The song "I Touch Myself" caused such a controversy it had trouble getting airplay in many US-area markets; so much to the point that while performing their song live in Texas at Austin Aqua Fest 1991 the plug was pulled on the band mid-set by organisers.

It wasn't until 1996 that their fifth studio album, ''[[Underworld (Divinyls album)|Underworld]]'', was released in Australia by [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]].<ref name="ARDb"/> Despite the success of ''diVINYLS'', Virgin had not kept them under contract and BMG did not release ''Underworld'' in the United States. As with ''What a Life!'', they worked with three producers, beginning with Peter Collins recording "[[I'm Jealous]]" in Nashville, followed by [[Keith Forsey]] for "Sex Will Keep Us Together" and "Heart of Steel".<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Howl"/> Although "Heart of Steel" was chosen as a single, Divinyls discontinued working with Forsey because according to Amphlett "he was a bit too 'pop' for us" and remaining tracks were produced by their drummer Drayton.<ref name="Chrissie"/> By the end of 1996, Amphlett and McEntee had a falling out and separated without formally disbanding Divinyls.<ref name="Herald"/>

===1998–2005: After the separation===
Following ''Underworld'', Amphlett pursued a stage career. In 1998, she played the role of [[Judy Garland]] in the Australian stage production of the life story of entertainer [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]], titled ''[[The Boy from Oz]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1437/is_199803/ai_n5949270 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202092610/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1437/is_199803/ai_n5949270 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-02 |title=''The Boy from Oz'' theater review |publisher=Find Articles at BNET.com |date=March 1998 |last=Woods |first=Mark |access-date=31 May 2008}}</ref> The production was a success and Amphlett's interpretation of Garland, during her final troubled years, brought her critical acclaim: she was nominated for the [[Helpmann Award]] for 'Best Female Actor in a Musical'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrepeople.com.au/feature_articles/2007/july/20070710_tp_helpmannawards.htm |title=Helpmann Award Nominations |last=Rafferty |first=Adam |date=10 July 2007 |access-date=31 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724141728/http://theatrepeople.com.au/feature_articles/2007/july/20070710_tp_helpmannawards.htm |archive-date=24 July 2008 }}</ref>

Amphlett and McEntee concentrated on solo projects and collaborations with other artists.

===2006–2012: Hall of Fame and reformation===
On 16 August 2006, Divinyls were inducted into the [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] and made their first performance for 10 years at the award ceremony.<ref name="Herald"/> They reformed shortly afterwards and a compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits (Divinyls album)|Greatest Hits]]'', was released by [[EMI|EMI Music Australia]] in August 2006. The band recorded four new songs via a satellite link: Amphlett and Drayton at Palm Studios in [[Las Vegas]] and McEntee in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. A single and B-side, "[[Don't Wanna Do This]]"/"Asphyxiated", was released in November 2007, with a third track, "All Pretty Things", released on a compilation album for the Homebake Festival. Amphlett stated that the band would return to the studio to record a full album provided they "survived" their Homebake headline gig and national tour.<ref name=newalbum>{{cite news |last=Winterford |first=Brett|title=Divinyls|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/divinyls/2007/12/07/1196812966879.html|access-date=23 April 2013 |newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 December 2007}}</ref>
