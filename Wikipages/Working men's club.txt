'''Working men's clubs''' are a type of private [[social club]] first created in the 19th century in industrialised areas of the United Kingdom, particularly the [[North of England]], the [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[Scotland]] and many parts of the [[South Wales Valleys]], to provide recreation and education for [[working class]] men and their families. They also began at this time in Australia, with a small number in Ireland, primarily Dublin.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==History==
The first recorded working men's club opened in 1857 in [[Reddish]]. Gregg set it up for his workers. He identified that many of his workers were shut out of their lodging throughout the day and evening, with nowhere to cook or even read a newspaper, and were forced to spend their non-working lives in a public house. Greggs Reddish Working Man club aimed to give them somewhere to relax.<ref name="Scapens">{{cite news |last1=Scapens |first1=Alex |title=Club celebrates its 150 year history |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/club-celebrates-its-150-year-history-1003022 |access-date=18 April 2020 |work=men |date=29 August 2007}}</ref> There are three working men's clubs in Reddish: this one, the North Reddish Working Men's Club and the architecturally significant [[Houldsworth Working Men's Club]].<ref name="Scapens"/>

The Wisbech Working Men's Club & Institute was formed from an inaugural meeting held on 5 January, 1864 in [[Wisbech]], Isle of Ely. The club celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2014. The club moved to its present site in 1867. It was once described as the most financially successful of all the clubs in England, with over 1,300 members in 1904.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/cambs/vol4/pp268-269|title= Miscellanous institutions|website= British History Online|accessdate= 24 September 2021}}</ref>

Despite the original educational ambitions, most working men's clubs are now mainly recreational. Typically, a club would have a room, often referred to (especially in Northern England) as a vault, with a bar for the sale and consumption of alcohol, [[snooker]], [[eight-ball|pool]] or [[bar billiards]] tables, as well as televisions for sport entertainment; many provide food. A much larger room would be connected, often called the concert or entertainment room, with a stage and a layout of tables, stools and backrest sofas. They often provide night time entertainment, mainly on the weekends such as [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]], [[raffle]]s, live music [[cabaret]] and comedy, playing  [[popular music]]. They are also known for their charitable works.

In recent years, declining membership has seen many clubs close down and others struggle to remain open.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cumbria-20890060 |title=BBC News&nbsp;– Brewers call time on Barrow working men's club |publisher=[[BBC Online]] |access-date=6 January 2013 |quote=Ken Brown, the Cumbria secretary for the Working Men's Club and Institute Union (CIU), said: 'Ten years ago there were more than fifty clubs affiliated to the CIU Cumbria, now we have 33.' |date=4 January 2013}}</ref> Some groups try to raise the profile of clubs, pointing to their historical legacies and their community roles.

===Twenty-first century===
Meanwhile, the nineteenth and early twentieth century educational ambitions of working men's clubs have now returned in new organisations such as the [[men's shed]] movement that started in [[Australasia]] and has spread to [[Europe]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mensshed.org/what-is-a-men's-shed/.aspx |title=What is a Men's Shed |publisher=MensShed.org |access-date= October 23, 2012}}</ref> and appeals to much the same community as working men's clubs. Similarly the growing [[hackerspace]] movement appeals mostly to younger working men and women, who forty years ago would have worked on their interests in their garden shed or garage and then met others of like mind at their local working men's club. However, with the rise in housing costs few younger people have access to such spaces, and instead were forced to use public spaces such as cafes prior to the introduction of shared facilities such as [[hackerspace]]s and [[men's shed]]s.

==Membership and structure==
Working men's clubs are [[cooperative]]s run by their members through a committee, usually elected annually. Each club has rules that tend to be vigorously enforced. The committee will discipline members (common punishments being a warning, or a ban for a period) for violations. Despite the name, women are allowed to be members in many clubs, and virtually all clubs allow entry to women. Non-members are not allowed entry unless signed in by a member.

In the UK they are registered as co-operatives under the [[Co-operative and Community Benefit Societies Act 2014]], normally using model rules<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wmciu.org.uk/CIU%20Rules%202015.pdf|title = CIU Home Page}}</ref> supplied by the [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union|Clubs and Institutes Union]].

A dispute at Wakefield City Workingmen's Club in 1978 led to a national campaign for equal membership rights for women. Sheila Capstick, whose husband was an activist in the NUM, had been a regular snooker player at the club before a ban was instituted on women playing snooker. Her protest, ''A Woman's Right to Cues'', developed into a nationwide campaign for equal rights: ''ERICCA – Equal Rights in Clubs Campaign for Action''.  In April 2007, after the resolution had been consistently rejected over years, the Club and Institutes Union accepted equal membership rights for women.<ref name="Capstick">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2 April 2007 |title=Club women win fight for equal rights at last |url=http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/club-women-win-fight-for-equal-rights-at-last-1-2091901|newspaper=Yorkshire Post |location=Leeds, UK |access-date=9 April 2016 }}</ref>

==Club and Institute Union==
Most clubs affiliate to the [[Working Men's Club and Institute Union]] (commonly known as the CIU or C&IU).  The CIU is affiliated to the Committee of Registered Clubs Associations or [[CORCA]]. A member of one affiliated club is entitled to use the facilities of other clubs. There are 2,200 affiliated working men's clubs in the UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wmciu.org.uk/html/branches.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322220527/http://www.wmciu.org.uk/html/branches.html |archive-date=2010-03-22 }}</ref>

The CIU has two purposes: to provide a national voice  for clubs, and to provide discounted products and services for clubs.

===Brewery===
Until 2004, clubs ran a brewery at [[Dunston, Tyne and Wear]], which brewed ales and lagers under the ''Federation'' brand. The brewery and brands were sold to [[Scottish & Newcastle]] for £16.2 million,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.s-n.com/sn_acq/ir/finnews/rnsitem?id=1089792001nRNSN8162A |title=Scottish & Newcastle&nbsp;– Financial News |publisher=Scottish & Newcastle plc |date=14 July 2004 |access-date=12 September 2008}}</ref> although CIU clubs still receive discounted beer. These discounts are passed on to members.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

==Impact of July 2007 smoking ban==
In December 2007 a poll by the British Institute of Innkeeping and the [[Federation of Licensed Victuallers Associations]] found that overall revenue was 7.3 per cent down as more men opted to drink at home, where they could also smoke.<ref>{{cite news |title=Working men's clubs hardest hit by smoking ban |newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] |date=18 December 2007}}</ref>
