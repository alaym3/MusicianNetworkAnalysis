==Life==
Hill was born in [[Naples, Texas]]. He began his singing career in the late 1950s as part of a [[gospel music|gospel]] group called the Spiritual Five, touring Texas. He was influenced by [[Sam Cooke]], [[B. B. King]], and [[Bobby Bland|Bobby "Blue" Bland]], and began performing his own songs and others in clubs in and around [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]], including stints fronting bands led by Bo Thomas and Frank Shelton. He took his stage name in emulation of B.&nbsp;B. King, which in turn inspired the band name [[ZZ Top]].<ref name="amg"/><ref name=tsha/><ref>{{cite web|title= Uncle Joe Benson – The Story: ZZ Top 9-11-15 The Stor |publisher= [[SoundCloud]] |access-date= September 13, 2015 |url= https://soundcloud.com/uncle-joe-benson/the-story-zz-top-9-11-15}}</ref>

Encouraged by [[Otis Redding]], who had seen him perform, he joined his older brother Matt Hill, a budding [[record producer]], in [[Los Angeles]] in 1963, and released his first single, "You Were Wrong", on the family's M.H. [[record label|label]]. It spent one week at number 100 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 1964, and Hill was quickly signed by [[Kent Records]].<ref name="amg"/> Most of the songs he recorded for Kent were written or co-written by Hill and arranged by the prominent [[saxophonist]] [[Maxwell Davis]]. None charted, but in retrospect many, such as "I Need Someone (To Love Me)", are now viewed with high regard by fans of soul music.<ref name=soulblues>[http://www.soulbluesmusic.com/zzhill.htm Z. Z. Hill at SoulBluesMusic]. Retrieved 29 March 2014.</ref><ref name=ace>[https://acerecords.co.uk/the-down-home-soul-of-z-z-hill  Liner notes for ''The Down Home Soul of Z Z Hill'', Ace Records]. Retrieved 29 March 2014.</ref>

After leaving Kent in 1968, he recorded briefly for [[Phil Walden]]'s [[Capricorn Records|Capricorn]] label, based in [[Macon, Georgia]], but after a disagreement with Walden his [[recording contract]] was bought by [[Swamp Dogg|Jerry "Swamp Dogg" Williams]]' Mankind label, where Hill fulfilled his end of the deal. He returned to California to record for his brother's label, Hill, and the song "Don't Make Me Pay for His Mistakes", produced by Matt Hill and Miles Grayson, became his biggest pop hit, reaching number 62 on the Hot 100. The Kent label reissued his 1964 recording of "I Need Someone", which also charted. Williams also recorded Hill in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], in 1971, resulting in several R&B hits, including "Chokin' Kind" and "It Ain't No Use", as well as the [[LP record|LP]] ''The Brand New Z. Z. Hill''.<ref name="whitburnr&b"/><ref name=shambling>[http://www.sirshambling.com/articles/z_z_hill/  "Z. Z. Hill"]. SirShambling.com. Retrieved 29 March 2014.</ref>

With his brother's help, Hill then signed with [[United Artists]], where he was aided by [[arrangement]]s and compositions by established R&B talents including [[Lamont Dozier]] and [[Allen Toussaint]], and released several singles that made the R&B chart in the mid 1970s. After his brother Matt's sudden death from a heart attack, Z. Z. Hill left United Artists and signed with [[Columbia Records]], recording two albums with leading arranger-producer, Bert de Coteaux in New York. Several singles taken from the albums charted, including "Love Is So Good When You're Stealing It", which spent 18 weeks on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart in the summer of 1977.<ref name="amg"/>

In 1979, he left Columbia and returned south, signing for [[Malaco Records]], a move which, according to [[Allmusic]] writer Bill Dahl, "managed to resuscitate both his own semi-flagging career and the entire [blues] genre at large".<ref name ="amg"/> His first hit for the label was his recording of "Cheating in the Next Room," written by [[George Jackson (songwriter)|George Jackson]], which was released in early 1982 and reached the R&B top 20, spending a total of 20 weeks on the chart. He had a number of best-selling albums for Malaco, the biggest being ''Down Home'', which stayed on the ''Billboard'' soul album chart for nearly two years. The song "Down Home Blues", also written by Jackson, was later recorded by labelmate [[Denise LaSalle]].<ref name ="amg"/> Hill's next album, ''The Rhythm & the Blues'', released in 1982, was also received with critical acclaim, and its success contributed to the subsequent boom in blues music, much of it recorded by the Malaco label, in Jackson, Mississippi.<ref name ="amg"/><ref name=tsha/><ref name=shambling/>

While touring in February 1984, Hill was involved in a car crash. He continued performing, but he died two months later, at the age of 48, from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] arising from a blood clot formed after the accident.<ref name="russell"/><ref name=tsha/><ref>[http://users.efortress.com/doc-rock/1980.html Dead Rock Stars Club] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115542/http://users.efortress.com/doc-rock/1980.html |date=2007-09-28 }}.

Hill's song "That Ain't the Way You Make Love" was sampled by [[Madvillain]] in their track "Fancy Clown".{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
