'''John Paul Larkin''' (March 13, 1942 – December 3, 1999), known professionally as '''Scatman John''', was an American musician. A prolific [[jazz pianist]] and vocalist for several decades, he rose to prominence during the 1990s through his fusion of [[scat singing]] and [[dance music]]. He recorded five albums, which were released between 1986 and 2001.

In the United States and Europe, Larkin is recognized for his 1995 singles "[[Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)]]" and "[[Scatman's World (song)|Scatman's World]]". He achieved his greatest success in Japan, where his album ''[[Scatman's World]]'' (1995) sold over a million copies. Larkin was also a recipient of the [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]]'s [[Annie Glenn]] Award for outstanding service to the stuttering community and a posthumous inductee to the [[National Stuttering Association]] Hall of Fame.

==Early life ==
Larkin was born in [[El Monte, California]]. He suffered from a severe [[Stuttering|stutter]] by the time he learned to speak, which led him to an emotionally traumatic childhood.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Scatman John Got Over His Stutter |author=Andrew Egan |date=January 24, 2017 |url=https://tedium.co/2017/01/24/scatman-john-stuttering-success-story/}}</ref> At age twelve, he began to learn the piano and was introduced to the art of [[scat singing]] two years later through records by [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and [[Louis Armstrong]], among others.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-john-larkin-1134204.html|title=Obituary: John Larkin|last=Perrone|first=Pierre|date=December 23, 1999|work=The Independent|access-date=February 28, 2017|language=en-GB}}</ref> The piano provided him with a means of artistic expression to compensate for his speech difficulties, and he "hid behind [the] piano because [he] was scared to speak."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/dec/08/news/mn-41653|title=John Larkin; Scat Singer Overcame Stuttering|last=OLIVER|first=MYRNA|date=December 8, 1999|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=February 28, 2017|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref>

==Musical career==
Larkin became a professional jazz pianist in the 1970s and 80s, playing many engagements in jazz clubs around Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} His first known performance on a studio album was in 1981 on the album ''Animal Sounds'' by [[Sam Phipps]]. In 1986, he released the self-titled album ''John Larkin'' on the Transition label. This album was produced by John himself, along with Marcia Larkin. It featured [[Joe Farrell]] on saxophone.

To advance his career in 1990, Larkin moved to [[Berlin]], Germany. Once there, he discovered an appreciative jazz culture and started playing jazz gigs.<ref name="e">''[http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/famous/irascat.html Scatman John’s Interview with Ira Zimmerman]'', mnsu.edu.</ref> This was when he first decided to take a monumental step away from his insecurities and add singing to his act for the first time, heavily inspired by the standing ovation he received for his rendition of the song "[[On the Sunny Side of the Street]]".{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} Soon after, his agent Manfred Zähringer from Iceberg Records (Denmark) thought of combining [[scat singing]] with modern [[dance music]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] effects. Larkin was hesitant at first, terrified of being laughed at and criticized once again, but BMG Hamburg was open.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Larkin was worried that listeners would realize he stuttered, and his wife, Judy, suggested that he talk about it directly in his music. Working with dance producers Ingo Kays and Tony Catania, he recorded the first single, "[[Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)]]".<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=300}}</ref> After his first big hit, he adopted the new name and persona of "Scatman" John.

In 1995, at age 53, Larkin became a worldwide star. Sales of his debut single were slow at first, but they gradually reached number one in many countries and sold over six million records worldwide.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> "Scatman (Ski-Ba-Bop-Ba-Dop-Bop)" charted highly across Europe and Japan and remains his biggest-selling and most well-known song.<ref name="a">''[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Scatman+John&titel=Scatman+%28Ski%2DBa%2DBop%2DBa%2DDop%2DBop%29&cat=s Scatman John's “Scatman” single’s positions]'', Dutchcharts.nl.</ref> He later followed up with the song "[[Scatman's World (song)|Scatman's World]]" entering the [[UK Singles chart]] at number 10, which met lesser but still notable success, selling a million copies and charting highly throughout Europe.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Recently{{when|date=November 2021}}, "Scatman's World" has had some resurgence on becoming an [[internet meme]].<ref name="b">''[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Scatman+John&titel=Scatman%27s+World&cat=s Scatman John's "Scatman's World" single’s positions]'', Dutchcharts.nl.</ref>

Following the success of these two singles, he released his debut album as Scatman John, also titled ''[[Scatman's World]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> which entered the top 10 album charts in many countries including his then home Germany<ref name="c">{{cite web |url=http://www.charts-surfer.de/musiksearch.php |title=''Scatman John's "Scatman's World" album position in Germany'' |access-date=June 24, 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212150442/http://www.charts-surfer.de/musiksearch.php |archive-date=December 12, 2009 }}, charts-surfer.de.</ref> as well as in Switzerland, Finland and Norway;<ref name="d">''[http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Scatman+John&titel=Scatman%27s+World&cat=a Scatman John's "Scatman's World" album’s positions]'' dutchcharts.nl.</ref> the album eventually sold millions of copies worldwide,<ref name="e"/> becoming so popular that a Scatman John design appeared on [[Coca-Cola]] cans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cokecollection.com/index.php?lang=en&pageid=50&canID=7212 |title=Scatman Coke can |work=CokeCollection}}</ref> He began a promotional and concert tour of Europe and Asia. Referring to a performance in Spain, Larkin said, "the kids screamed for five minutes straight, I couldn't start the song".<ref>Zimmerman, Ira. [http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/famous/irascat.html "The Stutter and the Scat is the Same Thing" Scatman Interview, 1995-12-04]</ref>

The second Scatman John album, ''[[Everybody Jam!]]'', was released in 1996. While nowhere near as successful on an international level as his debut, the album and [[Everybody Jam! (song)|accompanying single]] [[Big in Japan (phrase)|took off in]] Japan, the country in which he would see success on a larger scale than anywhere else in the world.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}} In Europe, subsequent singles failed to replicate the chart success of his first two singles, giving him the title [[two-hit wonder]].

The Japanese version of ''Everybody Jam!'' included a total of five bonus tracks, including the hit singles there [[Su Su Su Super Ki Re i]] and "Pripri Scat", which were commissioned by Japanese companies for commercials for cosmetics and [[pudding]] respectively. The [[Ultraman]] franchise even jumped on the Scatman bandwagon, releasing a single titled ''Scatultraman'', the cover art of which featured the Ultraman characters wearing Scatman's trademark hat and mustache.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} The album reached No. 45 in Switzerland.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hitparade.ch/showitem.asp?interpret=Scatman+John&titel=Everybody+Jam%21&cat=a |title=Scatman John - Everybody Jam! (Album) |work=Hitparade.ch |access-date=June 30, 2010}}</ref>

==Illness and death==
In late 1998 Larkin was diagnosed with lung cancer, but he continued his musical work despite being told to take it easy from his substantial workload. In June 1999, Larkin released his fourth and ultimately final album as Scatman John, ''[[Take Your Time (Scatman John album)|Take Your Time]]''. Shortly afterwards, he was sent into intensive treatment.

Larkin died at his home in Los Angeles on December 3, 1999, at the age of 57. He was surrounded by his wife Judy, his mother Harriet, and his brother Bill. He was [[cremated]], and in 2001 his ashes were scattered over the Pacific Ocean near [[Malibu, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnsu.edu/comdis/kuster/pioneers/scatman.html|title=Remembering Scatman John Larkin TOC|website=Mnsu.edu}}</ref>
