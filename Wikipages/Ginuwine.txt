== Career ==

=== Music ===

Ginuwine began his career as a member of [[Swing Mob]], a [[Rochester, New York]]-based record label and music compound founded by [[DeVante Swing|Donald "DeVante Swing" DeGrate]], a member of popular 90's R&B group [[Jodeci]]. There, he met rapper [[Missy Elliott|Melissa "Missy" Elliott]], singer-songwriter [[Static Major|Stephen "Static Major" Garrett]] and producer [[Timbaland|Timothy "Timbaland" Mosley]], who became his main collaborators through the 1990s. After Swing Mob folded, they continued working together on different projects, one of which was Ginuwine's 1996 debut album, titled ''[[Ginuwine...The Bachelor]]''.  The first single, "[[Pony (Ginuwine song)|Pony]]" showcased his smooth vocals and Timbaland's innovative production style,and also Static Major's writing skills,the two became a hit-making duo. "Pony" peaked at number 6 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It is still relevant today with the smooth upbeat tempos. It was used in the video game ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' in 2008. In 2012, "[[Pony (Ginuwine song)|Pony]]" was featured in a striptease dance performed by [[Channing Tatum]] in the film ''[[Magic Mike]]''. [[Mike Patton]] and [[Rahzel]] together perform a cover of "[[Pony (Ginuwine song)|Pony]]" during their concerts. Ginuwine covered [[Prince (musician)|Prince's]] "When Doves Cry" single from the movie soundtrack ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]''.

His second album, ''[[100% Ginuwine]]'', was released in 1999 and featured the hit singles "[[Same Ol' G]], "[[So Anxious]]" and "[[None of Ur Friends Business]]".  After ''100% Ginuwine'', Ginuwine and Timbaland grew apart.  Producers such as [[R. Kelly]] has crafted hits for him since then. In 2001, Ginuwine had a number-four hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 with the single "Differences", which also peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.

Within a year, Ginuwine lost both of his parents. He later wrote and recorded a song that is featured on his third album ''[[The Life (album)|The Life]]'' entitled "Two Reasons I Cry". In 2002, he was a featured artist on [[P. Diddy]]'s number-one hit "I Need a Girl (Part II)". Later that year, Ginuwine started his own label, Bag Entertainment. The label would feature artists such as Jose Cenquentez (who appeared on ''The Senior'') and Knight.

Ginuwine's fifth album, ''Back II Da Basics'', was released on November 15, 2005. The album debuted at number 12 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling close to 100,000 copies.
