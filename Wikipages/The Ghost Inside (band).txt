==History==

===Early years (2004–2009)===
As A Dying Dream, they released an EP, ''Now or Never'' on [[Frontline Records]]. A year later, they signed to [[Mediaskare Records]], where they re-recorded and re-released the EP with an additional track and bonus live footage. The release contained early versions of their debut album that followed. Not long after, they changed their name to the Ghost Inside, and released a full-length studio album entitled ''Fury and the Fallen Ones''.

===''Returners'' (2010–2012)===

Their second album, titled ''[[Returners (album)|Returners]]'', was released on June 8, 2010 via Mediaskare Records.

On February 24, 2011, it was announced that KC Stockbridge and the Ghost Inside mutually parted ways and that Andrew Tkaczyk, formerly the drummer and main songwriter in [[For the Fallen Dreams]], had been filling in on drums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/15863/The-Ghost-Inside-and-drummer-part-ways|title=The Ghost Inside and drummer part ways|date=February 24, 2011|publisher=Lambgoat.com|access-date=May 20, 2013}}</ref> As of January 10, 2012, the band has been signed to [[Epitaph Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalriot.com/news/the-ghost-inside-signs-to-epitath-records-announces-u-s-tour/|title=The Ghost Inside signs to Epitaph Records & Announces U.S Tour|date=January 10, 2012|publisher=metalriot.com|access-date=May 20, 2013}}</ref>

On January 9, 2015, the Ghost Inside posted on their Facebook page that they are parting ways with founding member and lead guitarist Aaron Brooks, leaving Jonathan Vigil as the last original member in the current lineup.

===Bus crash and hiatus (2015–2018)===

On the morning of November 19, 2015, the band's tour bus collided head on with a tractor trailer while headed west to Mesa, Arizona on U.S. Highway 180, eight miles east of the border patrol checkpoint outside of [[El Paso, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|title = The Ghost Inside involved in serious bus accident - UPDATED - News - Alternative Press|url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_ghost_inside_reportedly_involved_in_serious_bus_accident|website = Alternative Press|date = 19 November 2015|access-date = 2016-01-15}}</ref> The drivers of both vehicles died, while the remaining ten people on the bus survived.

On March 22, 2016, during the livestream of the Warped Tour band announcement of that year, it was announced that the Ghost Inside would play Warped Tour 2017. An announcement that far in advance was unprecedented. They were the first band announced for the tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_ghost_inside_will_play_vans_warped_tour_2017|title=The Ghost Inside will play Vans Warped Tour 2017 - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|date=22 March 2016|access-date=2016-03-23}}</ref> On March 23, 2016, Chris Davis, formerly of [[Texas in July]], was announced as an official member after touring with the band since 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/the-ghost-inside-add-guitarist-chris-davis|title=The Ghost Inside add guitarist Chris Davis|first=Stef|last=Lach|website=[[Metal Hammer]]|date=March 25, 2016|access-date=June 8, 2020}}</ref> On February 10, 2017, Vigil announced that the band would be unable to perform on Warped Tour 2017. Warped Tour announced they would continue to hold their spot for the band until they were well enough to play, even though the Warped Tour's full cross-country format was retired the following year.

On April 17, 2018, the band held their first practice since the accident. On April 30, 2018, the band confirmed and assured their fans with a statement in which they said "Yes, there is a future."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/80363/news-the-ghost-inside-assure-fans-yes-there-is-a-future|title=NEWS: The Ghost Inside assure fans "yes, there is a future"!|first=Zach|last=Redrup|website=DEAD PRESS!|date=April 30, 2018|access-date=June 8, 2020}}</ref>

===Return and ''The Ghost Inside'' (2019–present)===
On January 21, 2019, the band shared a photo of them in studio on Twitter after a fan asked if they were working on new music, indicating they had something in the works in front of them.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2019/01/22/stop-everything-it-looks-like-the-ghost-inside-are-working-on-new-music/|title=STOP EVERYTHING: It looks like The Ghost Inside are working on new music!!!!|last=brownypaul|date=2019-01-22|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-22}}</ref> On February 22, they announced a return show for July 13, 2019, at [[Shrine Exposition Hall, Los Angeles, CA 11/10/1967|The Shrine]] in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>[https://www.theprp.com/2019/02/22/news/the-ghost-inside-officially-announce-first-live-show-since-november-2015-bus-crash/ The Ghost Inside Officially Announce First Live Show Since November 2015 Bus Crash] The PRP. 22 February 2019. Retrieved 22 February 2019.</ref>

The show at The Shrine sold out in 4 minutes according to vocalist Jonathan Vigil. The show successfully took place on July 13, outside the venue with a festival-style stage rather than in the expo hall itself. During the show, Vigil said he wasn't sure if that would be the Ghost Inside's last show ever or if they'd play "a hundred more," but he did announce that the band was working on new music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/07/14/video-the-ghost-inside-play-their-first-show-since-horrific-2015-bus-crash/|title=Video: The Ghost Inside Play Their First Show Since Horrific 2015 Bus Crash|date=2019-07-14|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2019-07-14}}</ref>

In a video update on August 27, 2019, the band stated that they plan to perform some one-off shows at some point in 2020 but stressed that they are "not going on tour."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-the-ghost-inside-plan-to-play-shows-again-in-2020|title=NEWS: The Ghost Inside plan to play shows again in 2020!|date=2019-08-27|website=DEAD PRESS!|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>

On January 11, 2020 the band played their second comeback show at UNIFY Gathering in Australia where they alluded they'd come back to Australia in 2021, but nothing was confirmed yet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wallofsoundau.com/2020/01/15/unify-gathering-2020-festival-review-photo-gallery-9-12-january-tarwin-meadows-vic/|title=UNIFY Gathering 2020 – Festival Review & Photo Gallery 9-12 January @ Tarwin Meadows, VIC|date=2020-01-14|website=Wall Of Sound|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref>

On April 22, 2020 the band released a new single, "Aftermath", and announced their [[The Ghost Inside (album)|self titled album]] set for release on June 5, 2020.

On June 6, 2020, the Ghost Inside announced they had parted ways with longtime bassist Jim Riley following an alleged racial comment made by Riley in 2015, which Jim had opened up about the day before.<ref name="nme">{{cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/the-ghost-inside-part-ways-with-bassist-after-racial-slur-accusations-2683705|title=The Ghost Inside part ways with bassist Jim Riley after racial slur accusations|first=Nick|last=Reilly|publisher=NME|date=June 8, 2020|access-date=June 8, 2020}}</ref> In an interview that September, however, the band reflected that this was the "wrong call" and regretted firing Riley.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hadusek |first1=Jon |title=The Ghost Inside Now Say Firing Bassist Over Past Racial Insensitivity Was a Mistake |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/09/the-ghost-inside-firing-bassist-a-mistake/?new=true&utm_campaign=optim&utm_expid=.I2OkZS06Riahk3U0vrA5rQ.1&utm_referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F |website=[[Consequence of Sound]] |access-date=November 30, 2020 |date=September 17, 2020}}</ref> By November 2020, Riley had been reinstated per the band's official Instagram page.

In 2021, as the [[COVID-19]] pandemic began to lessen, the band returned to the stage once again in Worcester, Massachusetts on August 28.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eventbrite.com/e/the-ghost-inside-tickets-92385031115#|title=The Ghost Inside}}</ref> This would be the first time any of the songs off their self-titled record would be performed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.setlist.fm/setlist/the-ghost-inside/2021/outdoors-at-the-palladium-worcester-ma-3b8cf4f8.html|title=The Ghost Inside Setlist at Outdoors at the Palladium, Worcester}}</ref> They also planned to perform at the Blue Ridge Rock Festival in Virginia and Riot Fest in Chicago following their date at the Palladium. The band is due to return to the UK and Europe for shows in the Summer of 2022.

==Musical style, influences and songwriting==
The Ghost Inside's music has been classified as [[metalcore]]<ref name="Loudmag">{{cite web|url=http://www.loudmag.com.au/content/the-ghost-inside-getting-and-giving|publisher=Loudmag.com|title=The Ghost Inside: Getting and Giving|date=May 20, 2013|access-date=September 8, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140908232254/http://www.loudmag.com.au/content/the-ghost-inside-getting-and-giving|archive-date=September 8, 2014}}</ref> and "melodic, emotional [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Kraus|first=Brian|title=16 Modern Precursors Of Melodic Hardcore|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/the_16_forefathers_of_melodic_hardcore|website=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]|date=June 22, 2014|access-date=April 4, 2016|quote=Before the likes of [[Defeater (band)|Defeater]], [[Touché Amoré]], the Ghost Inside, [[Counterparts (band)|Counterparts]], [[Being As An Ocean]] and many more became the new faces of melodic, emotional hardcore, there were upperclassmen who were setting the stage.}}</ref> They have self-identified as melodic hardcore, for example on their [[Facebook]] page. However, former bassist and backing vocalist Jim Riley stated in a 2013 interview that "to [him] the band is a metalcore band" and that they're "similar to [[Unearth]] or [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]] or something like that, with a little bit less [[guitar solos]] and a little bit less singing".<ref name="Loudmag" /> He said that they are influenced by "an older generation of bands" such as [[Throwdown (band)|Throwdown]], [[Bury Your Dead]] (especially ''[[Beauty and the Breakdown]]''), [[Misery Signals]], [[Killswitch Engage]], Unearth (especially ''[[The Oncoming Storm]]'') and [[Bleeding Through]], some of which he considers "seminal to what metalcore is", as well as modern music that isn't necessarily heavy (such as [[pop punk]]), and that he himself listens "to a lot of [[emo]]".<ref name="Loudmag" /> In a 2009 interview, vocalist Jonathan Vigil stated that he grew up listening to [[punk rock]] bands such as [[NOFX]] and [[Less Than Jake]] before getting into heavier bands such as [[Hatebreed]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], while guitarist Aaron Brooks said that he listened to bands like [[Bad Religion]] before getting into [[Poison the Well (band)|Poison the Well]], that one of his favorite bands currently are [[Comeback Kid (band)|Comeback Kid]] and that he also appreciates Hatebreed.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ghost Inside: Hardcore-metal fury|url=http://www.live-metal.net/interviews_ghost-inside.html|publisher=Live Metal|date=July 15, 2009|access-date=November 21, 2015}}</ref> This musical background was further confirmed when Zach Johnson listed NOFX's ''[[Punk in Drublic]]'', [[Strung Out]]'s ''[[Suburban Teenage Wasteland Blues]]'' and [[AFI (band)|AFI]]'s ''[[Black Sails in the Sunset]]'' as his favorite three albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5qWQl5zuSw |title=Top Three with The Ghost Inside |publisher=YouTube |date=2016-09-23 |access-date=2020-04-23}}</ref>

Riley stated that when writing a song, the band usually puts the instrumentation together first, before vocalist Jonathan Vigil and guitarist Aaron Brooks write lyrics for it. He also noted that the decision to use [[clean vocals]] in some songs of ''[[Get What You Give]]'', such as "Engine 45", came from the band and wasn't forced by producer [[Jeremy McKinnon]].<ref name="Loudmag" />
