'''Rocko Rama''' is the main protagonist of the animated television series ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' and the comic book series of the same name. [[Carlos Alazraqui]] provided the voice of the anthropomorphic wallaby. His catchphrase is "Today is a very dangerous day."

== Conception and development ==
[[Image:Bennetwallaby.jpg|150px|thumb|left|[[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]] said that as he visited a [[zoo]], he encountered a real-life [[wallaby]] that was "minding his own business" while [[elephant]]s and [[monkey]]s "screamed for attention". According to Murray, this led to the development of Rocko's character.<ref name="CharMuseum"/>]]
Rocko first appeared in a never-released comic, where he has the name "Travis".<ref name="CharMuseum">"[http://joemurraystudio.com/character-museum/ Character Museum]".

Murray wanted to get his comic into syndication. Afterwards Murray made substantial changes to Rocko.<ref name="Ashechanged">"[http://joemurraystudio.com/blog/?p=931 The Evolution of Character]."

In the original pilot for ''Rocko's Modern Life'', the animators colored Rocko yellow instead of light beige. One month before the first episode was submitted to the animation studio in [[South Korea]], Murray changed the color when a toy company wishing to make Rocko plushes refused to license the character after citing that Rocko looked too similar to a yellow character used in one of the company's existing products.<ref name="Murray"/> Murray fought the changes with the Nickelodeon executives; in the end the executives insisted on changing the color, so Murray changed the color to [[beige]] and disliked the choice. On his website Murray said, "He was always yellow to me."<ref name="CharMuseum"/> Murray said that the company later backed out of the commitment and did not create the plush series.<ref>"[https://web.archive.org/web/20090221143738/http://www.joemurraystudio.com/tv/rocko_factoid2.shtml Rocko Factoid 2]."

Murray auditioned Alazraqui in [[San Francisco]], and chose him as the voice actor for Rocko.<ref name="Murray"/> Jeff "Swampy" Marsh, a storyboard writer, describes Alazraqui's voice for Rocko as "not really an accurate [[Australian English|Australian accent]]" {{sic}}; according to Marsh the team used the voice as Alazraqui used the voice for the [[pilot episode|pilot]].<ref>"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/interview.html Dan Abrams' interview with Jeff "Swampy" Marsh]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''.

Murray said that as the series progressed, he adjusted Rocko's design from episode to episode to be more "volume friendly" and "animator friendly". According to Murray, when he created independent films and the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' pilot, he created all of the character layouts in his mind and other animators used the layouts to create works. Murray said that when Rocko became "high volume", Murray taught [[United States|Americans]] and [[Korean people|Koreans]] how to draw the characters. Murray described Rocko as the most difficult character to draw, and he said that therefore he decided to adjust his character design in order to assist the overseas animators.<ref name="Murray"/> Murray said that as he and the directors continued to "quickdraw" the character changes to the design "naturally" lessened the "victim, paranoid" aspect and gave the character a "happy personality."<ref name="Ashechanged"/>

According to [[George Maestri]], Rocko has no [[family name]] because the writers were never able to come up with a family name that they liked.<ref name="Maestri">"[http://www.title14.com/rocko/contributors/maestri.html Lisa (Kiczuk) Trainor interviews George Maestri, story writer for Rocko's Modern Life]," ''The Rocko's Modern Life FAQ''</ref> In a concept sketch Murray named the character "Rocko Rama".<ref name="Beck">Beck, Jerry, ''Not Just Cartoons: Nicktoons!''</ref> The writers considered the family name "Stretchbrain" because the character's brain popped out of his head during "odd moments."<ref name="Maestri"/> The writers scrapped the idea, leaving the character [[mononymous person|mononymous]].

=== Change in model sheets ===
Rocko's design changed as his character evolved. The first version of the character was Travis. Murray said "I liked him, but changed him considerably for Rocko." Murray said that the version placed in the ''Rocko's Modern Life'' proposal was "much looser, and closer to my independent film style." Murray did not consider how the character would be animated, as Murray did not believe that the character would be animated. When the pilot for ''Rocko's Modern Life'' was approved, Murray began streamlining the character so that others could easily draw him. Murray said that one could perceive a difference between the character as he appears in the original model sheet used in the original animation versus the character as he appears in the animation produced abroad. Murray continued to streamline Rocko so that overseas studios could easily draw him. Murray and the directors had become so accustomed to quickdrawing Rocko that the changes in the character, in his words, "naturally occurred, lending more to the happy personality Rocko had developed into (less the victim, paranoid one from the beginning)."<ref name="Ashechanged"/>

== Character ==
Rocko lives in O-Town. Raised in [[Australia]],<ref name="Aus2">"[http://www.nickelodeon.com.au/toonroom/rocko/meetmain2.php Characters]" of ''Rocko's Modern Life'' Page 2, ''[[Nickelodeon Australia]]''</ref> Rocko later emigrated to the [[United States]] after he graduated [[high school]].<ref name="Murray"/> Murray suggests that Rocko's interest in the United States began with a vacation with his family as a youth; during the trip he met his future sidekick [[Filburt]]. Murray allowed for directors to create inconsistencies, reflecting how friends possess different and varied, nostalgic memories of the past. For instance, in the episode "Put to Pasture" the writers portray Rocko, Filburt and [[Heffer Wolfe]] as students at O-Town High School. Murray received many pieces of mail regarding the storyline inconsistencies.<ref name="Murray"/>

Rocko wears a blue shirt with purple triangles and orange shoes. He is known for being a loyal friend, not venturing outside his comfort zone and is known to say when a situation isn't going well: "_____ day is a very dangerous day." In "Trash-O-Madness", a family photograph depicts Rocko with a mother, father, and a younger sibling. "Wimp On the Barby" shows Rocko's family again, revealing that his younger sibling is a sister. Murray created a [[narcolepsy|narcoleptic]] older sister character named Magdalane "Maggie" in the episode "Wake Up Maggie" about her, but chose to never air the episode and never use the character.<ref name="Murray"/> Magdalane was created as a mother with 2 children.<ref name="Beck"/>

Although personally hygienic, Rocko is almost an pathological tendency to neglect his living space; several episodes, such as "[[Clean Lovin' / Unbalanced Load|Unbalanced Load]]", involve Rocko attempting to rectify severe messes or lapses in maintenance.

Rocko enjoys collecting comic books and likes rainbows.<ref name="Aus2"/>

[[Nickelodeon (South East Asia)|Nickelodeon South East Asia]]'s website describes Rocko as "generally very polite and sometimes shy" and that provocation can lead Rocko to become "determined and forceful."<ref name="SEAsiaProfile">"[https://web.archive.org/web/20041125020327/http://www.nicksplat.com/Tvshows/Characters/Nicktoons/Rockos_modern_life/rocko.html Rocko]," ''[[Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]''</ref> Jean Prescott of ''[[The Sun Herald]]'' described Rocko as a "pudgy little wallaby star" who tries to "do what's right" and is devoted to his friend Heffer and dog [[Spunky (Rocko's Modern Life)|Spunky]]. Prescott has called the character "lovable."<ref>{{cite news |author=Jean Prescott |author-link=Jean Prescott |title=Rocko And The Gang Take On Pollution |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BX&s_site=sunherald&p_multi=BX&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB624033690585A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |quote=The pudgy little wallaby star of Joe Murray's squash-and-stretch cartoon series, ''Rocko's Modern Life,'' always tries to do what's right.

''Common Sense Media'' reviewer Andrea Graham, whose review is posted on [[Go.com]], describes Rocko as "[[paranoia|paranoid]] and obsessed with cleanliness" and that he initially perceives his neighbors to be "loud and messy." Graham describes Rocko as accepting of his neighbors' faults and seeing the positive qualities within them.<ref>"[http://family.go.com/entertainment/article-csm-80290-tv-review--rocko-s-modern-life-t/ TV Review: Rocko's Modern Life]," ''Common Sense Media'' on [[Go.com]]</ref>

In an early character profile presented to the networks Murray described Rocko as "a young [[anthropomorphic]] [[Woody Allen]], who has just moved away from his home into a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] adult world."<ref name="Beck"/>

=== Careers ===
In the television show, in his day-to-day life, Rocko works as a cashier at a local comic book shop<ref name="Aus2"/> called Kind of a Lot O' Comics, which is owned by [[Characters in Rocko's Modern Life#Mr. Smitty|Mr. Smitty]] and sells mostly [[Characters in Rocko's Modern Life#Really Really Big Man|Really Really Big Man]] comics until he is currently unemployed in ''Static Cling''. Rocko worked at Mega Lot-o Comics owned by chairman of [[Conglom-O]], [[Characters in Rocko's Modern Life#Mr. Dupette|Mr. Dupette]], [[Ed Bighead|Ed Bighead's]] boss. In the television show, his other jobs include tattoo artist, plumber's assistant, phone operator, a product tester at Conglom-O, a tow truck driver, an underwear model and a cartoonist for the program ''Wacky Delly''.

In the official comic book, Rocko works as a comic book dealer in Issue #7's "Conned Again", working for "Humongo Con."

=== Neighbors ===
Rocko's neighbors are Ed, with whom he has a semi-rivalry, and [[Bev Bighead]]. Bev considers Rocko a very sweet neighbor. He and his dog Spunky, who often eats the neighbors' salmon bushes, are a source of constant annoyance to Ed. In the episode ''Skid Marks'', Rocko's drivers license reveals that Rocko and the Bigheads live on "Boogie Blvd."

=== Friends ===
Rocko's best friends are [[Heffer Wolfe]], a steer who eats a lot and was adopted and raised by a family of wolves, and [[Filburt]], a bespectacled turtle with neurotic [[Woody Allen]]-esque mannerisms, who often feels nauseated.

=== Love life ===
In early concept sketches Murray indicated that Rocko bears a strong crush on a character named "Melba Toast".<ref name="Beck"/> Rocko expresses this trait in Season One, bearing a crush on the [[unseen character]] until he discovers that Melba has a serious boyfriend named Dave in "Love Spanked". Melba has only been mentioned once since.

In subsequent episodes, Rocko bears crushes for other characters. In "S.W.A.K.", Rocko has been vying for the attention from the pretty kangaroo mail-lady that comes to his door every day; he writes her a love note that he is too scared to send so Heffer does it for him instead. Rocko fails to retrieve the letter and gets the impression that the mail-lady would rather go out with Heffer. This turns out to be a joke on the mail-lady's part and she actually returns Rocko's feelings. In "[[Wallaby on Wheels]]", Rocko learns to roller skate to impress Sheila, a girl who hangs out at the roller rink, and becomes jealous when it is implied she is attracted to Heffer. In the end, he wins her over after saving Heffer's life. In "I See London, I See France", Rocko tries to win over Claudette, who turned out to be his female wallaby [[pen pal]] from [[Paris]], but she is more interested in Heffer.

== Video game appearances ==
Rocko is the main playable character of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life: Spunky's Dangerous Day]]'' and also in the console version of ''[[Nicktoons: Attack of the Toybots]]'', an actor in [[Microsoft]]'s ''[[3D Movie Maker|Nickelodeon 3D Movie Maker]]'', and can be drawn in ''[[Drawn to Life]]'' and ''[[Drawn to Life: SpongeBob SquarePants Edition]]''. Rocko and Heffer make a cameo appearance on one of the loading screens in ''[[Nicktoons MLB]]''. Rocko and Heffer are playable characters in the Nickelodeon game ''Super Brawl Universe''.
