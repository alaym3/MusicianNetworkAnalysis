On 3 March 2016, Avatar revealed the name of the new album, ''[[Feathers & Flesh]]'', via their official website, and through social media.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avatarmetal.com |title=Avatar Official Website |publisher=avatarmetal.com |date=2 March 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/avatar-feathers-and-flesh-album-for-the-swarm-video/ |title=Avatar Announce 'Feathers and Flesh' Album Details + 'For the Swarm' Music Video |publisher=loudwire.com |date=3 March 2016 |access-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> A release date of 13 May 2016 was also announced, as well as several pre-ordering merchandise bundles that would be available to order on 17 March 2016.  One bundle offers a 60-page, 109-verse poem hardcover book described on the band's Facebook as 'a story too extensive for any booklet'. The first single, "For The Swarm," was released as a reward for those pre-ordering the album on [[iTunes]]. A [[music video]] of this single was also released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/avatar-feathers-and-flesh-album-for-the-swarm-video/ |title=Avatar Announce 'Feathers and Flesh' Album Details + 'For the Swarm' Music Video |publisher=Loudwire.com |date=3 March 2016 |access-date=3 March 2016}}</ref> Fan reception of the new song and video were high, as evidenced in ''For The Swarm'' being voted #1 in [[Loudwire | Loudwire's]] Battle Royale for the week ending 11 March 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/battle-royale-avatar-silvertung-crash-video-countdown/ |title=Battle Royale: Avatar + Silvertung Crash Video Countdown |publisher=loudwire.com |date=11 March 2016 |access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> On 17 March 2016 the singles, "Regret" and "House of Eternal Hunt" were released to help kick off pre-ordering of merchandise bundles for ''Feathers & Flesh''. A video directed by Johan Carlén was released featuring the two songs playing sequentially as the view pans around a darkened art gallery, with many paintings of birds, primarily owls, mirroring some of the artwork that the band has created for the individual songs on their album. "Regret," as the opening track on the album, is described by the band as “an intense journey through epicness” and, “...by far the most different album intro we ever written.” The song introduces The Owl, the protagonist of the album as she lays dying, reflecting on her past. "House of Eternal Hunt," described by the band as "the definition of [[heavy metal music|metal]]", starts the tale of The Owl, a "predator ruling the sky" according to Eckerström.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/avatar-regret-house-of-eternal-hunt/ |title=Avatar Unveil 'Regret' and 'House of Eternal Hunt' From 'Feathers & Flesh' Album|publisher=loudwire.com |date=17 March 2016 |access-date=18 March 2016}}</ref> The first official single, "The Eagle Has Landed," was released 25 March 2016. As with the previously released singles, this track was an instant gratification reward for pre-ordering ''Feathers & Flesh''. The song introduces The Eagle, "...crashing into the world of his adversary", according to Eckerström. No new music video was released with this track, though the band did upload the song to its official [[YouTube]] channel with the same video featured for the release of "Regret" and "House of Eternal Hunt."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/avatar-single-the-eagle-has-landed/ |title=Avatar Reveal New Single 'The Eagle Has Landed'|publisher=loudwire.com |date=25 March 2016 |access-date=28 March 2016}}</ref>

But it was humorous for us, and now it’s important for us to do something devoid of humor, there is no joking around with this and it pulls us back into reality.
