Her next album, [[M for Empathy]], was released on March 1, 2019.  Despite having 11 songs, the album clocks a total of 16 minutes.  [[M for Empathy]] marked Read’s emerging use of piano to add to her customary guitar-oriented songs, as the primary instrument for the song “Bunk” and prominent in other songs including “M for Magic” and “M for Mush”.

Lomelda's next album, ''Hannah'', was released on September 4, 2020 via [[Double Double Whammy]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Lomelda Announces New Album Hannah, Unveils Lead Single |url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/lomelda/lomelda-announces-new-album-unveils-lead-single/#album-artwork-hannah |website=Paste |publisher=Paste Media Group |accessdate=10 July 2020}}</ref> and continued Read's process of maturing into a formidable songwriter.  "Hannah" received Best New Music from [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] with a score of 8.3, calling the album "stunning" and saying that "The magic of Lomelda’s music is in that exchange, an infusion of strength and care from one person to another, no matter how small or ordinary. It has anchored Read’s songwriting from the beginning, and it is threaded throughout Hannah, which is warm and enveloping, like a hug.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gottsegen |first1=Will |title=Lomelda - Hannah |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/lomelda-hannah/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork |accessdate=29 October 2020}}</ref>  On the song "It's Lomelda", Read hints at artists that have influenced her music, including [[Low (band)]], [[The Innocence Mission]], [[Frankie Cosmos]], [[Frank Ocean]] and [[Yo La Tengo]].
