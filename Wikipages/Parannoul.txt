Parannoul describes himself as "just a student writing music in my bedroom".<ref name="Stereogum" /> In an interview<ref>https://rateyourmusic.com/feature/sonemic-interview-parannoul/</ref> with [[Sonemic]] Parannoul stated that the album cover for his album [[To See the Next Part of the Dream]] ''"is actually one of the scenes from リリイ・シュシュのすべて [[All About Lily Chou-Chou]]. It's not an important scene at all, it's just a scene that lasts five seconds...But for some reason, the smokestack and the white smoke made me feel nostalgic. (Actually the whole movie feels that way.) When I first saw the factory with smokestacks, I felt stuffy and uncomfortable, like we won't have freedom inside there. On the other hand, I felt something contradictory when I saw the pure white smoke coming out of it. I wanted to show the clean yet dirty side of youth through this smokestack. The little birds above the smoke show the mind of the teenager that wanted to be free."''<ref>https://woove.wuvt.vt.edu/Parannoul-Interview</ref>
