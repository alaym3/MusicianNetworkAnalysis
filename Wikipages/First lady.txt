==History==
{{main|First Lady of the United States}}
It has been noted that the earliest use of the term "first lady" is in reference to women of a high ranking or outstanding women in their field,<ref name="MerriamWebsterFirstLady">{{cite web |title=The Story Behind 'First Lady' |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/first-lady-flotus-history-usage |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] |access-date=24 September 2021}}</ref> and that the term, as used to describe the female spouse of the [[president of the United States]], saw its first documented use in 1838 in reference to [[Martha Washington]], who was never referred to as such during [[George Washington]]'s time as President.<ref name="MerriamWebsterFirstLady"/>

The first person to have been referred to as "first lady" on a regular basis during her time in the position was [[Harriet Lane]], who was actually [[James Buchanan]]'s niece, as Buchanan was a lifelong bachelor.<ref name="MerriamWebsterFirstLady"/>

==Variations==
[[File:Queen Mathilde with NATO spouses 2017.jpg|thumb|[[Queen Mathilde of Belgium]] meeting with the First Ladies and First Gentlemen of NATO members at the [[Palace of Laeken|Royal Castle of Laeken]] on Thursday, May 25, 2017.]]
The male equivalent of the title in countries where the head of state's spouse has been a man, such as the [[Philippines]] or [[Malta]], is '''first gentleman'''. While there has never been a male spouse of a U.S. president, "[[List of first gentlemen in the United States|First Gentleman]]" is used in the United States for the male spouse of a [[mayor]] or [[Governor (United States)|governor]].

'''First spouse''' and '''First partner''', both rare variations of the title, can be used in either case where the spouse of a political leader is of any gender. This term is used to promote [[gender equality]] and [[gender neutrality]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Steinmetz |first1=Katy |title=Wives of Political Leaders Have Long Been Called 'First Ladies.'

In the United States, collectively, the president of the United States and his spouse are known as the ''first couple''<ref>[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/first-couple Collins English Dictionary definition].  Retrieved 2013-12-08</ref> and, if they have children, they are usually referred to as the ''[[First Family|first family]]''.

==Non-political uses==
It has become commonplace in the United States for the title of "First Lady" to be bestowed on women, as a term of endearment, who have proven themselves to be of exceptional talent or unique notoriety in non-political areas. The phrase is often, but not always, used when the person in question is either the wife or "female equivalent" of a well-known man (or men) in a similar field. For example, the term has been applied in the entertainment field to denote the "first lady of television" ([[Lucille Ball]]), the "first lady of song" ([[Ella Fitzgerald]]), the "first lady of country music" ([[Tammy Wynette]], although [[Loretta Lynn]] was also known by the title), the "first lady of ''[[Star Trek]]''" (actor/producer [[Majel Barrett]]), the "first lady of American [[Soul music|soul]]" ([[Aretha Franklin]]),<ref>{{cite news | title=Are you ready to think outside the box? The abuses of the English language that readers hated most have inspired a new Telegraph book, explains Richard Preston | work=Daily Telegraph | first=Richard | last=Preston | date=2007-05-25 | page=24}}</ref> the "first lady of the [[Grand Ole Opry]]" ([[Loretta Lynn]]), “the first lady of American cinema” ([[Lilian Gish]]) and the "first lady of the American stage" ([[Helen Hayes]]).<ref>{{cite news | title=The Year Of Hoping For Magic | work=New York Times | first=Joan | last=Didion | date=2007-03-04 | page=1}}</ref>

The term has also been used to refer to wives of college and university presidents in some cases.<ref>{{cite web |title=Meet the First Lady, Beth Clements |url=https://www.clemson.edu/president/first-lady.html |website=[[Clemson University]] |access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=First Lady Marisela Rosas Hemphill, Ph.D. |url=https://www.odu.edu/about/president/first-lady-biography |website=[[Old Dominion University]] |access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=IU president and first lady receive University Medal, IU's highest honor |url=https://news.iu.edu/stories/2021/06/iu/releases/11-university-medal-president-first-lady.html |website=[[Indiana University]] |access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>

The term "first lady" is also used to denote a woman who occupies the foremost social position within a particular locality, in this sense being particularly popular in [[Africa]], where the pre-eminent female noble in some chieftaincy hierarchies, such as those of the [[Yoruba people]], is often referred to by the title.<ref>{{Cite journal | title=The City of York in the Sixteenth Century | first=Maud | last=Sellers | journal=The English Historical Review | volume=9 | issue=34 |date=April 1894 | pages=275–304 | doi=10.1093/ehr/IX.XXXIV.275| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1793611 }}; {{Cite journal | title=Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York | first=A. | last=Russell | volume=21 | year=1889 | pages=494–515}}</ref>

In recent years, the term has also been used to refer to the [[Presbytera|wife of the pastor of a church]], especially in predominantly [[black church]]es.<ref>DuBois, Joshua.
