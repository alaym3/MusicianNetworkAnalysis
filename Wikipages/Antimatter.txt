{{Antimatter}}
{{Modern physics}}
In [[modern physics]], '''antimatter''' is defined as [[matter]] composed of the [[antiparticle]]s (or "partners") of the corresponding [[subatomic particle|particles]] in "ordinary" matter. Minuscule numbers of antiparticles are generated daily at [[particle accelerator]]s{{mdash}}total artificial production has been only a few [[nanogram]]s<ref>{{cite news|access-date=2018-11-08|title=Ten things you might not know about antimatter|url=https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/april-2015/ten-things-you-might-not-know-about-antimatter|newspaper=symmetry magazine}}</ref>{{mdash}}and in natural processes like [[cosmic ray]] collisions and some types of [[radioactive decay]], but only a tiny fraction of these have successfully been bound together in experiments to form antiatoms. No [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] amount of antimatter has ever been assembled due to the extreme cost and difficulty of production and handling.

Theoretically, a particle and its antiparticle (for example, a [[proton]] and an [[antiproton]]) have the same [[mass]], but opposite [[electric charge]], and other differences in [[quantum number]]s. For example, a proton has positive charge while an antiproton has negative charge.

A collision between any particle and its anti-particle partner leads to their mutual [[annihilation]], giving rise to various proportions of intense [[photon]]s ([[gamma ray]]s), [[neutrino]]s, and sometimes less-massive particle{{ndash}}antiparticle pairs. The majority of the total energy of annihilation emerges in the form of [[ionizing radiation]]. If surrounding matter is present, the energy content of this radiation will be absorbed and converted into other forms of energy, such as heat or light. The amount of energy released is usually proportional to the total mass of the collided matter and antimatter, in accordance with the notable [[mass–energy equivalence]] equation, {{math|{{nowrap|''E''{{=}}''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}}}.<ref>{{cite web |date=11 August 2011 |title=Smidgen of Antimatter Surrounds Earth |url=http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926174944/http://news.discovery.com/space/pamela-spots-a-smidgen-of-antimatter-110811.html |archive-date=26 September 2011|url-status=live}}</ref>

Antimatter particles bind with each other to form antimatter, just as ordinary particles bind to form normal matter. For example, a [[positron]] (the antiparticle of the [[electron]]) and an antiproton (the antiparticle of the proton) can form an [[antihydrogen]] atom. The [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] of [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] have been artificially produced, albeit with difficulty, and are the most complex anti-nuclei so far observed.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Agakishiev |first=H. |display-authors=etal |collaboration=STAR Collaboration |date=2011 |title=Observation of the antimatter helium-4 nucleus |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=473 |issue=7347 |pages=353–356 |arxiv=1103.3312 |bibcode=2011Natur.473..353S |doi=10.1038/nature10079 |pmid=21516103|s2cid=118484566 }}</ref> Physical principles indicate that complex antimatter atomic nuclei are possible, as well as anti-atoms corresponding to the known chemical elements.

==Definitions==
Antimatter particles can be defined by their negative [[baryon number]] or [[lepton number]], while "normal" (non-antimatter) matter particles have a positive baryon or lepton number.<ref>

The [[French language|French]] term [[wikt:contraterrene|''contra-terrene'']] led to the initialism "C.T." and the science fiction term "seetee",<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Antimatter |encyclopedia=Science Fiction Encyclopedia |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/antimatter }}</ref> as used in such novels as ''[[Seetee Ship]]''.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McCaffery |first=Larry |title=An Interview with Jack Williamson |journal=Science Fiction Studies |volume=18 |issue=54 |date=July 1991 |url=https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/williamson54interview.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060912123849/https://www.depauw.edu/sfs/interviews/williamson54interview.htm |archive-date=12 September 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Conceptual history==
The idea of [[negative matter]] appears in past theories of matter that have now been abandoned. Using the once popular [[vortex theory of gravity]], the possibility of matter with negative gravity was discussed by [[William Mitchinson Hicks|William Hicks]] in the 1880s. Between the 1880s and the 1890s, [[Karl Pearson]] proposed the existence of "squirts"<ref>

}}</ref> and sinks of the flow of [[Luminiferous aether|aether]]. The squirts represented normal matter and the sinks represented negative matter. Pearson's theory required a fourth dimension for the aether to flow from and into.<ref>

The term antimatter was first used by [[Arthur Schuster]] in two rather whimsical letters to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in 1898,<ref>

 }}</ref> in which he coined the term. He hypothesized antiatoms, as well as whole antimatter solar systems, and discussed the possibility of matter and antimatter annihilating each other. Schuster's ideas were not a serious theoretical proposal, merely speculation, and like the previous ideas, differed from the modern concept of antimatter in that it possessed [[antigravity|negative gravity]].<ref>

Dirac realised that his [[Dirac equation|relativistic version]] of the [[Schrödinger equation|Schrödinger wave equation]] for electrons predicted the possibility of [[antielectron]]s. These were discovered by [[Carl David Anderson|Carl D. Anderson]] in 1932 and named [[positron]]s from "positive electron". Although Dirac did not himself use the term antimatter, its use follows on naturally enough from antielectrons, antiprotons, etc.<ref>

==Notation==
One way to denote an [[antiparticle]] is by adding a bar over the particle's symbol. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as {{Subatomic particle|proton}} and {{Subatomic particle|antiproton}}, respectively. The same rule applies if one were to address a particle by its constituent components. A proton is made up of {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up quark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down quark}} [[quark]]s, so an antiproton must therefore be formed from {{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=no|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}} [[antiquark]]s. Another convention is to distinguish particles by positive and negative [[electric charge]]. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as {{Subatomic particle|Electron}} and {{Subatomic particle|Positron}} respectively. To prevent confusion, however, the two conventions are never mixed.

==Properties==
Theorized anti-gravitational properties of antimatter are currently being tested at the AEGIS experiment at CERN.<ref>{{Cite web|title=AEGIS {{!}} CERN|url=https://home.cern/science/experiments/aegis|access-date=2021-01-02|website=home.cern}}</ref> Antimatter coming in contact with matter will annihilate both while leaving behind pure energy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The matter-antimatter asymmetry problem {{!}} CERN|url=https://home.cern/science/physics/matter-antimatter-asymmetry-problem|access-date=2020-07-01|website=home.cern}}</ref> Research is needed to study the possible gravitational effects between matter and antimatter, and between antimatter and antimatter. However research is difficult considering when the two meet they annihilate, along with the current difficulties of capturing and containing antimatter.

There are compelling theoretical reasons to believe that, aside from the fact that antiparticles have different signs on all charges (such as electric and baryon charges), matter and antimatter have exactly the same properties.<ref>

Antiparticles are created everywhere in the [[universe]] where high-energy particle collisions take place. High-energy [[cosmic ray]]s impacting [[Earth's atmosphere]] (or any other matter in the [[Solar System]]) produce minute quantities of antiparticles in the resulting [[particle jet]]s, which are immediately annihilated by contact with nearby matter. They may similarly be produced in regions like the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]] and other galaxies, where very energetic celestial events occur (principally the interaction of [[relativistic jet]]s with the [[interstellar medium]]). The presence of the resulting antimatter is detectable by the two [[gamma ray]]s produced every time [[positron]]s annihilate with nearby matter. The [[frequency]] and [[wavelength]] of the gamma rays indicate that each carries 511&nbsp;[[electronvolt|keV]] of energy (that is, the [[rest mass]] of an [[electron]] multiplied by ''[[speed of light|c]]''<sup>2</sup>).

Observations by the [[European Space Agency]]'s [[INTEGRAL|INTEGRAL satellite]] may explain the origin of a giant antimatter cloud surrounding the galactic center. The observations show that the cloud is asymmetrical and matches the pattern of [[X-ray binaries]] (binary star systems containing black holes or neutron stars), mostly on one side of the galactic center. While the mechanism is not fully understood, it is likely to involve the production of electron–positron pairs, as ordinary matter gains kinetic energy while falling into a [[stellar remnant]].<ref>

==Natural production==
{{main|Positron emission}}

Positrons are produced naturally in β<sup>+</sup> decays of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (for example, [[potassium-40]]) and in interactions of gamma quanta (emitted by radioactive nuclei) with matter. [[Antineutrino]]s are another kind of antiparticle created by natural radioactivity (β<sup>−</sup> decay). Many different kinds of antiparticles are also produced by (and contained in) [[cosmic ray]]s. In January 2011, research by the [[American Astronomical Society]] discovered antimatter (positrons) originating above [[thunderstorm]] clouds; positrons are produced in terrestrial gamma-ray flashes created by electrons accelerated by strong electric fields in the clouds.<ref>

===Observation in cosmic rays===
{{main|Cosmic ray}}

Satellite experiments have found evidence of [[positron]]s and a few antiprotons in primary cosmic rays, amounting to less than 1% of the particles in primary cosmic rays. This antimatter cannot all have been created in the Big Bang, but is instead attributed to have been produced by cyclic processes at high energies. For instance, electron-positron pairs may be formed in [[pulsar]]s, as a magnetized neutron star rotation cycle shears electron-positron pairs from the star surface. Therein the antimatter forms a wind that crashes upon the ejecta of the progenitor supernovae. This weathering takes place as "the cold, magnetized relativistic wind launched by the star hits the non-relativistically expanding ejecta, a shock wave system forms in the impact: the outer one propagates in the ejecta, while a reverse shock propagates back towards the star."<ref>

Cosmic ray antiprotons also have a much higher energy than their normal-matter counterparts (protons). They arrive at Earth with a characteristic energy maximum of 2&nbsp;GeV, indicating their production in a fundamentally different process from cosmic ray protons, which on average have only one-sixth of the energy.<ref>

There is an ongoing search for larger antimatter nuclei, such as [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] nuclei (that is, anti-alpha particles), in cosmic rays. The detection of natural antihelium could imply the existence of large antimatter structures such as an antistar. A prototype of the ''AMS-02'' designated ''AMS-01'', was flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any [[#Antihelium|antihelium]] at all, the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1×10<sup>−6</sup> for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio.<ref>

===Antiprotons, antineutrons, and antinuclei===
{{Main|Antiproton|Antineutron}}

The existence of the antiproton was experimentally confirmed in 1955 by [[University of California, Berkeley]] [[physicist]]s [[Emilio Segrè]] and [[Owen Chamberlain]], for which they were awarded the 1959 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/ | title=All Nobel Prizes in Physics | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100723052215/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/ | archive-date=23 July 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref> An antiproton consists of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark ({{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Up antiquark}}{{Subatomic particle|link=yes|Down antiquark}}). The properties of the antiproton that have been measured all match the corresponding properties of the proton, with the exception of the antiproton having opposite electric charge and magnetic moment from the proton. Shortly afterwards, in 1956, the antineutron was discovered in proton–proton collisions at the [[Bevatron]] ([[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]) by [[Bruce Cork]] and colleagues.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/extending02.html | title=Breaking Through: A Century of Physics at Berkeley, 1868–1968 | publisher=[[Regents of the University of California]] | date=2006 | access-date=18 November 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709235643/http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/physics/extending02.html | archive-date=9 July 2010 | url-status=live}}</ref>

In addition to anti[[baryon]]s, anti-nuclei consisting of multiple bound antiprotons and antineutrons have been created. These are typically produced at energies far too high to form antimatter atoms (with bound positrons in place of electrons). In 1965, a group of researchers led by [[Antonino Zichichi]] reported production of nuclei of antideuterium at the Proton Synchrotron at [[CERN]].<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode=1965NCimS..39...10M | title=Experimental observation of antideuteron production | date=1965 | last1=Massam | first1=T. | last2=Muller | first2=Th. | last3=Righini | first3=B. | last4=Schneegans | first4=M. | last5=Zichichi | first5=A. | journal=Il Nuovo Cimento | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=10–14 | doi=10.1007/BF02814251| s2cid=122952224 }}</ref> At roughly the same time, observations of antideuterium nuclei were reported by a group of American physicists at the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]].<ref>{{cite journal | bibcode=1965PhRvL..14.1003D | date=June 1965 | first1=D.

In 1995, [[CERN]] announced that it had successfully brought into existence nine hot antihydrogen atoms by implementing the [[SLAC]]/[[Fermilab]] concept during the [[PS210 experiment]]. The experiment was performed using the [[Low Energy Antiproton Ring]] (LEAR), and was led by Walter Oelert and Mario Macri.<ref>

}}</ref> Fermilab soon confirmed the CERN findings by producing approximately 100 antihydrogen atoms at their facilities. The antihydrogen atoms created during PS210 and subsequent experiments (at both CERN and Fermilab) were extremely energetic and were not well suited to study. To resolve this hurdle, and to gain a better understanding of antihydrogen, two collaborations were formed in the late 1990s, namely, [[ATHENA]] and [[ATRAP]].

In 1999, CERN activated the [[Antiproton Decelerator]], a device capable of decelerating antiprotons from {{val|3500|ul=MeV}} to {{val|5.3|u=MeV}}&nbsp;– still too "hot" to produce study-effective antihydrogen, but a huge leap forward. In late 2002 the ATHENA project announced that they had created the world's first "cold" antihydrogen.<ref>

The antiprotons are still hot when initially trapped. To cool them further, they are mixed into an electron plasma. The electrons in this plasma cool via cyclotron radiation, and then sympathetically cool the antiprotons via [[Coulomb potential|Coulomb]] collisions.

Manipulations of the trap electrodes then tip the antiprotons into the positron plasma, where some combine with antiprotons to form antihydrogen. This neutral antihydrogen is unaffected by the electric and magnetic fields used to trap the charged positrons and antiprotons, and within a few microseconds the antihydrogen hits the trap walls, where it annihilates. Some hundreds of millions of antihydrogen atoms have been made in this fashion.

In 2005, ATHENA disbanded and some of the former members (along with others) formed the [[ALPHA Collaboration]], which is also based at CERN. The ultimate goal of this endeavour is to test [[CPT symmetry]] through comparison of the [[atomic spectra]] of [[hydrogen]] and antihydrogen (see [[hydrogen spectral series]]).<ref>

In 2016 a new antiproton decelerator and cooler called ELENA (Extra Low ENergy Antiproton decelerator) was built. It takes the antiprotons from the antiproton decelerator and cools them to 90&nbsp;keV, which is "cold" enough to study. This machine works by using high energy and accelerating the particles within the chamber. More than one hundred antiprotons can be captured per second, a huge improvement, but it would still take several thousand years to make a [[nanogram]] of antimatter.

Most of the sought-after high-precision tests of the properties of antihydrogen could only be performed if the antihydrogen were trapped, that is, held in place for a relatively long time. While antihydrogen atoms are electrically neutral, the [[spin (physics)|spins]] of their component particles produce a [[magnetic moment]]. These magnetic moments can interact with an inhomogeneous magnetic field; some of the antihydrogen atoms can be attracted to a magnetic minimum. Such a minimum can be created by a combination of mirror and multipole fields.<ref>

===Preservation===
<!--===Antimatter trap===!-->

Antimatter cannot be stored in a container made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and an equal amount of the container. Antimatter in the form of [[charged particle]]s can be contained by a combination of [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field|magnetic]] fields, in a device called a [[Penning trap]]. This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which [[atomic trap]]s are used. In particular, such a trap may use the [[dipole]] moment ([[Electric dipole moment|electric]] or [[Magnetic moment|magnetic]]) of the trapped particles. At high [[vacuum]], the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a [[magneto-optical trap]] or [[Magnetic trap (atoms)|magnetic trap]]. Small particles can also be suspended with [[optical tweezers]], using a highly focused laser beam.<ref>

==Uses==

===Medical===
Matter–antimatter reactions have practical applications in medical imaging, such as [[positron emission tomography]] (PET). In positive [[beta decay]], a [[nuclide]] loses surplus positive charge by emitting a positron (in the same event, a proton becomes a neutron, and a [[neutrino]] is also emitted). Nuclides with surplus positive charge are easily made in a [[cyclotron]] and are widely generated for medical use. Antiprotons have also been shown within laboratory experiments to have the potential to treat certain cancers, in a similar method currently used for ion (proton) therapy.<ref>

Since the energy density of antimatter is higher than that of conventional fuels, an antimatter-fueled spacecraft would have a higher [[thrust-to-weight ratio]] than a conventional spacecraft.

If matter–antimatter collisions resulted only in [[photon]] emission, the entire [[rest mass]] of the particles would be converted to [[kinetic energy]].

The reaction of {{val|1|ul=kg}} of antimatter with {{val|1|u=kg}} of matter would produce {{val|1.8|e=17|ul=J}} (180 petajoules) of energy (by the [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula, {{nowrap|1=''E''=''mc''<sup>2</sup>}}), or the rough equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT – slightly less than the yield of the 27,000&nbsp;kg [[Tsar Bomba]], the largest [[thermonuclear weapon]] ever detonated.

Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic propulsion technology because of the nature of the annihilation products. While electron–positron reactions result in gamma ray photons, these are difficult to direct and use for thrust. In reactions between protons and antiprotons, their energy is converted largely into relativistic neutral and charged [[pion]]s. The [[Pion#Neutral pion decays|neutral pions]] decay almost immediately (with a lifetime of 85 [[attoseconds]]) into high-energy photons, but the [[Pion#Charged pion decays|charged pions]] decay more slowly (with a lifetime of 26 nanoseconds) and can be [[Antimatter rocket#Direct use of reaction products|deflected magnetically to produce thrust]].

Charged pions ultimately decay into a combination of [[neutrino]]s (carrying about 22% of the energy of the charged pions) and unstable charged [[muon]]s (carrying about 78% of the charged pion energy), with the muons then decaying into a combination of electrons, positrons and neutrinos (cf. [[muon decay]]; the neutrinos from this decay carry about 2/3 of the energy of the muons, meaning that from the original charged pions, the total fraction of their energy converted to neutrinos by one route or another would be about {{nowrap|1=0.22 + (2/3)⋅0.78 = 0.74}}).<ref>

For more regular (earthly) applications (for example, regular transport, use in portable generators, powering of cities, ...) artificially created antimatter is not a suitable energy carrier, despite its high energy density, because the process of creating antimatter is extremely inefficient.

Some researchers{{Who|date=May 2012}} claim that with current technology, it is possible to obtain antimatter for [[United States dollar|US$]]25 million per gram by optimizing the collision and collection parameters (given current electricity generation costs).{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}
Many experts{{Who|date=March 2011}}, however, dispute these claims as being far too optimistic by many orders of magnitude. They point out that, in 2004, the annual production of antiprotons at [[CERN]] was several picograms at a cost of $20 million. This means that to produce 1&nbsp;gram of antimatter, [[CERN]] would need to spend 100 quadrillion ({{val|e=17}}) dollars and run the antimatter factory for 100 billion years.

Antimatter production costs, in mass production, are almost linearly tied to electricity costs, so economical pure-antimatter thrust applications are unlikely to come online unless a very cheap power source is found.

Storage is another problem, as antiprotons are negatively charged and repel each other, so that they cannot be concentrated in a small volume (cf. [[space charge]]). [[Plasma oscillation]]s in the charged cloud of antiprotons can cause instabilities that drive antiprotons out of the storage trap. For these reasons, to date, only a few million antiprotons have been stored simultaneously in a magnetic trap, which corresponds to much less than a femtogram. Antihydrogen atoms or molecules are of neutral charge, they are not as ionically unstable as antiprotons. The drawback is that cold antihydrogen is far more complex to produce than mere antiprotons.

One researcher from the CERN laboratories, which produces antimatter regularly, said:
