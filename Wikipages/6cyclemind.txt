'''6cyclemind''' (sometimes spelled as ''Six Cycle Mind'', ''6 Cycle Mind'', ''6CycleMind'' or ''6Cyclemind'') is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] rock band composed of Tito Fortunato "Tutti" Caringal II on [[vocals]], Ryan "Rye" Sarmiento on [[rhythm guitar]]s and backing vocals, Roberto "Bob" Cañamo on [[bass guitar]] and backing vocals, Herbert Hernandez on [[lead guitars]] and Vic Aquino on [[drums]].

The band's music is a fusion of [[alternative music|alternative]] and [[Popular music|pop]] music. The band gained a mainstream exposure in the early 2000s and was a prominent fixture of the Tunog Kalye era.

==History==
The group has released five studio albums under [[Sony Music]] Philippines: ''Permission to Shine'' (2003), ''Panorama'' (2005), ''Home'' (2007),'' Fiesta! Magsasaya Ang Lahat'' (2007), and ''Project: 6cyclemind'' (2009).

They previously performed for the [[Tanduay]]'s "First Five", along with [[Rico Blanco]] (2009), [[Kamikazee (band)|Kamikazee]], [[Chicosci]], [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]] and [[Bamboo (band)|Bamboo]] (2010).

The band was the endorser of Suzuki for two consecutive years after 2010. Through the Suzuki Invasion tour, they performed their hits in different parts of the country on those years.{{when|date=June 2018}}

In 2011, lead vocalist Ney Dimaculangan went on hiatus to pursue other musical endeavors but eventually pursued a solo career and later fronted his namesake band citing "burnout" as primary reason. Drummer Tutti Caringal replaced him as the lead vocalist.<ref>{{cite news |title=The world spins anew for 6cyclemind |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/54899/the-world-spins-anew-for-6cyclemind/ |access-date=4 May 2020 |work=Inquirer Lifestyle |date=29 June 2012}}</ref>

In 2015, lead vocalist Tutti Caringal, who won as councilor in the [[2013 Cabuyao local elections|2013 elections in Cabuyao, Laguna]], temporarily went on hiatus due to his candidacy as a re-electionist for the 2016 elections. He won the said elections and won again in the 2019 elections. He remains active in both of his political and band duties. Caringal came from a family of armies.

===Name origin===
The name "6cyclemind" comes from the five members plus their manager, Darwin Hernandez of Soupstar Entertainment. Collectively, they all contribute to composing, arranging and brainstorming, which is a continuous cycle in their creation of music, hence 6cyclemind.

Carlos "Chuck" Isidro was the former lead guitarist for [[Afterimage (band)|Afterimage]]. When Afterimage disbanded, Isidro worked in the recording company. During his stay, he signed up a group managed by Darwin Hernandez where he met Ryan "Rye" Sarmiento, Roberto "Bob" Cañamo, Gilbert "Gibbz" Magat and Rhoneil "Ney" Dimaculangan. Isidro and Hernandez agreed to form a band with them, which became 6cyclemind. Magat was then later replaced by Tutti Caringal of the band Protein Shake.
