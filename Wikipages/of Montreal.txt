This article uses [[singular they]] for consistency.}} relocation to Athens, Georgia. There, they met [[Derek Almstead]] ([[Circulatory System]], [[Marshmallow Coast]], [[Elf Power]]) and [[Bryan Poole]], who also performs as [[The Late B.P. Helium]]. Together, they recorded their debut album, ''[[Cherry Peel]]'', and subsequent releases ''[[The Bird Who Ate the Rabbit's Flower]]'' and ''[[The Bedside Drama: A Petite Tragedy]]''.

After production on ''[[The Gay Parade]]'', the band's third album, began in 1998, Poole left the band to focus on his involvement with Elf Power, another [[Elephant Six]] band.<ref name=beepscalifornian />  Barnes then recruited [[James Husband (music project)|James Husband]] and [[Dottie Alexander]], who had been performing together as Lightning Bug vs. Firefly.<ref name=opticaldottie>{{cite web|url=http://theofmontrealinterviewarchive.blogspot.com/2009/06/2006-03-16-optical-atlas.html |title=interview archive: 2006-03-16 - Optical Atlas |publisher=Theofmontrealinterviewarchive.blogspot.com |date=June 23, 2009 |access-date=March 2, 2015}}</ref>  Derek moved from drums to bass, and Marshmallow Coast's Andy Gonzales joined soon after. Prior to the release of ''The Gay Parade'' in 1999, of Montreal released a number of singles and a re-release of ''The Bird Who Continues to Eat the Rabbit's Flower''.

===1999–2006===
Following the release of ''The Gay Parade'', the band signed with [[Kindercore Records]], and in 2001, the [[concept album]] ''[[Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse]]'' was released. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5952-coquelicot-asleep-in-the-poppies-a-variety-of-whimsical-verse/|title=Of Montreal: Coquelicot Asleep in the Poppies: A Variety of Whimsical Verse Album Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-20}}</ref> 

Kindercore Records would fold shortly after the release of ''[[Aldhils Arboretum]]'', and Andy and Derek left the band. Barnes took to writing and performing their 2004 album ''[[Satanic Panic in the Attic]]'' mostly by themself. It was released by [[Polyvinyl Records]].

In 2005 ''[[The Sunlandic Twins]]'' was released.

===2007–2012===

Kevin Barnes recorded most of the band's 2007 release, ''[[Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?]]'', by themself while living in [[Norway]] and Athens, Georgia. Barnes also released a companion CD to ''Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?'' called ''[[Icons, Abstract Thee]].''<ref name=AversionSchild>[http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=355] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}</ref>  In 2007, Kevin Barnes performed five songs nude during a performance in Las Vegas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/26205-nsfw-of-montreals-kevin-barnes-naked/ |title=NSFW: Of Montreal's Kevin Barnes NAKED! &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=February 22, 2007 |access-date=March 2, 2015}}</ref> In Paris, they did a ''Take-Away Show'' acoustic video session shot by [[Vincent Moon]].

In an essay addressing the concept behind the album's release, Kevin Barnes stated, "We feel that there's no reason to produce another object that just sits on a shelf. We only want to produce objects that have a function and that can be treasured for their singularness."<ref>[http://ofmontreal.net/blog/2008/09/27/we-will-only-propagate-exceptional-objects/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080930234857/http://ofmontreal.net/blog/2008/09/27/we-will-only-propagate-exceptional-objects/ |date=September 30, 2008 }}</ref> In an interview with [[National Public Radio|NPR]], Kevin Barnes revealed that the concept of the CD may be going the way of the [[8-track tape|8-track]] in favor of MP3 downloads.
