'''Machine Head''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Oakland, California]]. The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist/guitarist [[Robb Flynn]], who remains the only original member of the band. Machine Head's aggressive musicianship made it one of the pioneering bands in the [[new wave of American heavy metal]]. Its current lineup comprises Flynn, bassist [[Jared MacEachern]], guitarist [[Wacław Kiełtyka]] and drummer Matt Alston. Bassist [[Adam Duce]], guitarists [[Logan Mader]], [[Ahrue Luster]] and [[Phil Demmel]], and drummers [[Tony Costanza]], [[Chris Kontos (musician)|Chris Kontos]] and [[Dave McClain (musician)|Dave McClain]] are former members of the band; Mader and Kontos toured with the band in 2019 and 2020 as part of the 25th anniversary tour for its first album, ''[[Burn My Eyes]]'' (1994).

Machine Head's first four albums earned the band a growing fan base in Europe, however the band would not have success in the United States until later releases. The band drew controversy with its fourth album, ''[[Supercharger (album)|Supercharger]]'' (2001), which was released three weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]]; its only single, "[[Crashing Around You]]", and its music video (which featured burning buildings) was pulled from all media outlets. The band nearly disbanded in 2002 after negotiating off its label [[Roadrunner Records]] as a result of the controversy, however the band would eventually re-sign with the label.

Having experimented with elements of [[groove metal]] and [[nu metal]] in its early releases, Machine Head changed to a more traditional [[thrash metal]] sound and longer songs with its sixth album, ''[[The Blackening]]'' (2007), which drew critical acclaim and was chosen as Album of the Decade by ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' in 2010; the album's first single, "[[Aesthetics of Hate]]", also earned the band a [[Grammy Award]] nomination. The band achieved similar success with its following two albums, ''[[Unto the Locust]]'' (2011) and ''[[Bloodstone & Diamonds]]'' (2014), before returning to its nu metal roots with the band's ninth album, ''[[Catharsis (Machine Head album)|Catharsis]]'' (2018).

Machine Head has released nine studio albums, two live albums, one video album, 13 singles and 15 music videos. Four of the band's studio albums have been [[Music recording sales certification|certified silver]] in the United Kingdom, and the band's highest peak on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] came with ''Bloodstone & Diamonds'' at number 21. As of 2013, the band has sold over three million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=3348284 |title=Tickets for Robb Flynn Of Machine Head : Acoustic Performance &#124; Roxy Theatre at TicketWeb |publisher=Ticketweb.com |date=2013-01-21 |access-date=2014-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150714060642/http://www.ticketweb.com/t3/sale/SaleEventDetail?dispatch=loadSelectionData&eventId=3348284 |archive-date=July 14, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and ''Burn My Eyes'' (1991–1995)===
Machine Head was formed on October 12, 1991, in [[Oakland, California]] by vocalist/guitarist [[Robb Flynn]]. Flynn had recently parted ways with [[Vio-lence]] after a physical fight between the band members and a local gang, but still had a desire to write music, and recruited bassist [[Adam Duce]], guitarist [[Logan Mader]] and drummer [[Tony Costanza]] to form his own band.<ref name="Revolver">{{cite journal| author=Wiederorn, Jon |date=May 2007 |title=Machine Head: Through the Ashes |journal=[[Revolver Magazine]]}}</ref> Despite the popular belief that it came from the [[Deep Purple]] album of the [[Machine Head (album)|same name]], Flynn settled on the name Machine Head purely because he thought it "sounded cool".<ref name="TNN">{{cite web |author=Neff, Troy |url=http://www.theentertainmentnexus.com/interviews/rag/mcclainDave.htm |title=Dave McClain interview by Troy Neff |publisher=The Entertainment Nexus |access-date=2008-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120003637/http://www.theentertainmentnexus.com/interviews/rag/mcclainDave.htm |archive-date=2015-01-20 }}</ref> The band started [[Jam (music)|jamming]] in a local warehouse shared with four [[punk rock]] bands.<ref name="MH1 bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.machinehead1.com/bio.html |title=Machine Head – Bio |publisher=Machinehead1.com |access-date=2008-02-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026020331/http://www.machinehead1.com/bio.html |archive-date=October 26, 2007 }}</ref> Machine Head recorded a demo in a friend's bedroom, funded with US$800.<ref name="Revolver"/><ref name="MH1 bio"/> A record executive representing [[Roadrunner Records]] listened to the demo and signed the band.<ref name="Revolver"/>

Not long after ''Burn My Eyes''{{'s}} release Machine Head started touring heavily in support of the album, opening for [[Slayer]] in Europe in the latter half of 1994, a tour which ended with their own headline show at the [[London Astoria]]. Following the success of the support tour, the band returned to Europe for a headline tour in early 1995, performing in the same venues they opened for Slayer.<ref name="Abslut Adam">{{cite web| url=http://www.absolutmetal.com/AdamInterview.htm |title=Machine Head interview with Adam Duce |publisher=Absolutmetal.com |date=1997-10-23 |access-date=2008-02-22}}</ref> The band would return to Europe for the summer festival season but Kontos refused to tour and the band drafted Walter Ryan for the festival dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0R9wfEPxeE |title=Machine Head - 02 BLOOD FOR BLOOD live @ Donington Park, Donington, England 1995-08-26 - YouTube |publisher=Uk.youtube.com |access-date=2011-10-22}}</ref> On the band's return to the US, Kontos was fired because he was not keeping to touring commitments.

===''The More Things Change...'' and ''The Burning Red'' (1996–2000)===
After touring for ''Burn My Eyes'', Machine Head entered the studio in 1996 to record its second studio album, ''[[The More Things Change...]]'', with Richardson producing and mixing for a second time. The album was released on March 26, 1997, and debuted at number 138 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart.<ref name="Billboard">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=machine head|chart=all}} |title=Artist chart history |publisher=[[Billboard charts]] |access-date=2008-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628212934/http://www.billboard.com/artist/276909/machine%2Bhead/chart |archive-date=June 28, 2015 }}</ref> Machine Head toured in Europe with [[Napalm Death]], [[Coal Chamber]] and [[Skinlab]], then went on the first [[Ozzfest]] for the first tours in support of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html |title=Ozzfest alumini |publisher=Ozzfest.com |access-date=2008-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103010421/http://www.ozzfest.com/static_content/view/alumni.html |archive-date=January 3, 2008 }}</ref> Mader showed up to a practice session late, high on [[methamphetamine]], cursing at and insulting the band members; and quit the band later that day.

After three years of touring and working with producer [[Ross Robinson]], Machine Head released its third studio album, ''[[The Burning Red]]'', on July 27, 1999. The band added new elements to its music, including [[rapping]] vocals, a move which some believe to have been influenced by [[Ahrue Luster]] himself.<ref name="Revolver"/> This album, along with the band's change in image and musical direction was highly criticized, with critics and fans alike accusing the band of "[[selling out]]".<ref name="Revolver"/> Nevertheless, McClain stated they weren't trying to sound like popular bands but "wanted to sound different".<ref name="Revolver"/> Rick Anderson of Allmusic stated Machine Head was "sounding a bit looser and less constricted musically than they have in the past".<ref name="TBR AMG">{{cite web| author=Anderson, Rick |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r424189|pure_url=yes}} |title=''The Burning Red'' overview |publisher=Allmusic |access-date=2008-02-23}}</ref> ''The Burning Red'' became Machine Head's top selling album for a number of years, and debuted at number 88 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=3145 |title=Metal/Hard Rock Album Sales In The US As Reported By SoundScan |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2002-04-30 |access-date=2008-02-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225912/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=3145 |archive-date=2011-06-06 }}</ref>

Debuting at number 115 on the ''Billboard'' 200, the album was released on October 2, 2001.<ref name="Billboard"/> The album met the same criticism as ''The Burning Red'', especially for the ever-present rapping vocals. [[Blabbermouth.net]] reviewer Borivoj Krgin stated ''Supercharger'' "is likely to disappoint everyone who is expecting the Bay Area quartet to return to the ultra-testosterone-charged sounds of their first two albums".<ref name="SC BMN">{{cite web |author=Krgin, Borivoj |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=51 |title=CD reviews – Machine Head ''Supercharger'' |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=2008-02-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017232045/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=51 |archive-date=2008-10-17 }}</ref>

Machine Head released a single for "[[Crashing Around You]]" as well as a music video. The video was released several weeks after the [[September 11 attacks]], and was banned from [[MTV]] for the depictions of falling buildings. Roadrunner Records, expecting to make a fair profit from album promotions, dropped the band's funding, causing Machine Head to leave the label.<ref name="Metalunderground">{{cite web| url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=9004 |title=Interview With Machine Head's Phil Demmel |publisher=Metalunderground.com |date=2007-08-12 |access-date=2007-11-21}}</ref> At the same time the band was leaving Roadrunner, Luster departed from the band for musical differences.

By 2002, Machine Head had sold over 1.3 million albums worldwide, and overall ''Supercharger'' (mixed by Colin Richardson) would go on to sell 250,000 copies worldwide, which was their lowest selling album to date. Once the tour for the album had been completed, Machine Head and Roadrunner Records mutually decided to sever ties with regards to distribution in North America and around the world, however to fill the ties, the band released ''[[Hellalive]]'' (also mixed by Richardson) which was a recording of a Brixton Academy, London set.

In 2002, Luster left the band and was temporarily replaced by Phil Demmel, who played in thrash band Vio-lence alongside Flynn. Demmel played some festival shows with Machine Head (including a headlining slot at the With Full Force festival in Germany). Then with Demmel not being able to commit to the band, he and Machine Head parted ways. The remainder of the band starting writing songs for the next album (eventually ''Through the Ashes...''), and hoping to get signed to a record label. They recorded a short demo, including a radio-style song called "Pins and Needles", and an Electronic Press Kit for the companies, also hoping they can get signed on the strength of their previous efforts. Nearly every record label in the music industry rejected the four track demo.

After Machine Head's European tour, Luster returned to his family business and the band started writing together as a three-piece, while leaving a position open for Demmel. In March 2003, Demmel joined Machine Head as a full-time guitarist and started writing with the band. By June 2003, Machine Head entered a studio with Flynn producing.<ref name="lambgoat">{{cite web|author=Unrest, Kirby |date=January 2005 |url=http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/machine_head.aspx |title=Machine Head interview |publisher=Lambgoat.com |access-date=2008-02-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226174652/http://www.lambgoat.com/features/interviews/machine_head.aspx |archive-date=December 26, 2007 }}</ref> On October 31, 2003, Machine Head released ''[[Through the Ashes of Empires]]'' in Europe.

The band was turned down by multiple record labels in the United States, until Roadrunner USA, interested in the new album, offered Machine Head another record contract. Machine Head accepted the offer on the grounds that the band owns 100% of the music. On April 20, 2004, ''Through the Ashes of Empires'' was released in the United States with a bonus track for the Americans' long wait for the album's release.<ref name="lambgoat"/> The album debuted at number 88 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Billboard"/> The band released a single for "Imperium", the video for which received heavy rotation on MTV.

Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album a 9.5 out of 10, saying ''The Blackening'' is "one of the purest, finest, most powerful expressions of modern heavy metal released" and compared it to the 1986 [[Metallica]] album ''[[Master of Puppets]]'',<ref name="Blabbermouth - The Blackening">{{cite web|title=Blabbermouth - ''The Blackening'' review |author=Kaye, Don |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1066 |access-date=2007-08-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015224258/http://roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1066 |archive-date=2007-10-15 }}</ref> while Allmusic editor Thom Jurek described the album as "an over the top rage and pummelfest with all the qualities that earned the group its enormous fan base by touring and recording", praising the songs "Beautiful Mourning", "[[Halo (Machine Head song)|Halo]]", and "[[Now I Lay Thee Down]]".<ref name="Allmusic - The Blackening">{{cite web |title=Allmusic - ''The Blackening'' |author=Jurek, Thom |publisher=Allmusic |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1023773|pure_url=yes}} |access-date=2007-08-03}}</ref> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reviewer Andy Greene, however, responded negatively as he was displeased with the songs running over ten minutes.<ref name="The Blackening - Rolling Stone">{{cite web |title=''The Blackening'' - ''Rolling Stone'' |author=Greene, Andy |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2007-03-21 |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/13885770/review/13891164 |access-date=2007-08-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014060825/http://rollingstone.com/reviews/album/13885770/review/13891164|archive-date=14 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>
