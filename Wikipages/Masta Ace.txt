He appeared on the classic 1988 [[Juice Crew]] [[posse cut]] "[[The Symphony (song)|The Symphony]]". He is noted for his distinct voice and rapping proficiency,<ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 247">Shapiro, Peter, 2005, ''The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin'', p. 247.</ref><ref name="Allmusic" /><ref name="rollingstone.com">[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/punchlinewordsworth/albums/album/105637/review/5946567/disposable_arts]{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> and has influenced several MCs.

== Biography ==
=== 1988–1994 ===
Clear graduated from the [[University of Rhode Island]] in 1988, after meeting [[Marley Marl]] in 1987 during his summer break.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/masta-ace-biography|title=Who is Masta Ace and what has he contributed to music?|work=eNotes|access-date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> Ace made his recording debut on the Juice Crew posse-cut "[[The Symphony (song)|The Symphony]]", along with fellow [[Juice Crew]] members [[Craig G]], [[Kool G Rap]] and [[Big Daddy Kane]], released on [[Marley Marl]]'s ''In Control'' album.<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=212}}</ref> The album also featured two additional Ace tracks, "Keep Your Eyes on the Prize" and "Simon Says". In 1989, he released his first solo single, "Together" b/w "Letter to the Better". His debut album, ''[[Take a Look Around (album)|Take a Look Around]]'', was released through Marl's [[Cold Chillin' Records|Cold Chillin']] label in 1990, featuring production from Marl and DJ Mister Cee.<ref name="LarkinDM" /> The album featured two minor hit singles in "Music Man" and "Me & The Biz",<ref name="LarkinDM" /> the latter track including Ace impersonating Biz Markie who did not reach the studio for the planned duet.<ref name="Allmusic" />

In the early stages of his career, Masta Ace was very energetic (cf. "Jeep Ass Niguh", where, tongue-in-cheek, he taunts police officers for their knee-jerk predisposition to harass black youth on city streets.) He also recorded material with a six-member supporting entourage, [[Masta Ace Incorporated]]. In light of his newly claimed status as a veteran, he has gravitated toward an earnest, matter-of-fact plainspokenness in the new millennium. Many of the songs that have lent newfound heft to his reputation are simple, no-nonsense rumination on feelings and facts of urban American life, including "Soda and Soap" and "Beautiful".<ref name="Allmusic" />

During the years between his debut and his second album, Ace began having bitter feelings toward the commercial state of hip hop music, as well as the prominence of [[Gangsta rap]], feelings which ruled the content on his second release, 1993's ''[[SlaughtaHouse]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM" /> with the loose concept of the album seeing Ace taking the fake "gangsta emcees" to his "SlaughtaHouse". The album featured Ace's new crew, [[Masta Ace Incorporated]], which included Eyceurokk, Lord Digga, Paula Perry and R&B vocalist Leschea.  The singles "SlaughtaHouse", "Saturday Nite Live", "Style Wars" and "Jeep Ass Niguh" were taken from the album. The latter featured an unlisted remix titled "Born to Roll", which became a crossover single in 1994, peaking at No. 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/309916/masta+ace/chart |title=Masta Ace – Chart history |publisher=Billboard |date=August 21, 2004 |access-date=March 8, 2017}}</ref> In the same year, Ace became a member of a temporary crew [[Crooklyn Dodgers]], formed for the release of [[Spike Lee]]'s movie, ''[[Crooklyn]]'', along with MC's [[Special Ed]] and [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]] of [[Black Moon (band)|Black Moon]], and recorded the title track of the album soundtrack.<ref name="LarkinDM" /> The song became Ace's second [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] hit in 1994, peaking at No. 60 on the chart.

=== 1995–2000 ===
Ace furthered his mainstream appeal in 1995, with his radio-friendly ''[[Sittin' on Chrome]]'' album. This effort was also released with the Masta Ace Incorporated crew, now also known as The I.N.C. The album was Ace's most commercially successful release, breaking into the Top 20 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' 's Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums chart. ''Sittin' On Chrome'' included "Born to Roll", as well as two other Hot 100 hit singles, "The I.N.C. Ride" and "[[Sittin' on Chrome EP|Sittin' on Chrome]]". By this time, Ace had become fully involved in his music on the production end as well, usually under the name Ase One. Following the album's success, Ace had a falling out with I.N.C. members Lord Digga and Paula Perry, leading to the breakup of the crew. After the split, Ace was largely missing from the hip hop scene over the next five years, save for a number of random vinyl singles. During his vinyl days, he bounced from a number of labels, releasing his "Cars" single on Tape Kingz Records, his "Yeah Yeah Yeah" and "NFL" singles on the Union Label, his "NY Confidential" single on Replay Records, his "Express Delivery" single on Three Sixty Records, his "Spread It Out/Hellbound" single on Yosumi Records, his "Conflict" single on Mona Records, his "Ghetto Like" single on Fat Beats, his "So Now U A MC" single on Bad Magic Records, and his "Brooklyn Blocks" single on [[Buckshot (rapper)|Buckshot]]'s [[Duck Down Records]].<ref name="Allmusic" />

[[File:Masta ace-02-mika.jpg|thumb]]

=== 2001–present ===
Ace's "Ghetto Like" single led to a misunderstanding with an underground emcee named Boogieman, who released a somewhat similar single titled "Ghetto Love" which was released on 420recordings  not long before. He thought that Ace was "biting" his track and released a diss song toward Ace titled "Just You Wait". Ace responded to Boogieman on the diss track "Acknowledge", which also dissed [[The High & Mighty]] over a misunderstanding. The trading of records led to a rap battle between the two at a [[Lyricist Lounge]] event. "Acknowledge" was also included on "''Disposable Arts''."<ref name="Allmusic" /> Masta Ace can also be found performing numerous "Dubtitled" voice overs on the television series titled "[[Kung Faux]]" seen in 150+ countries worldwide.

''Disposable Arts'' became one of the most acclaimed underground hip hop releases of 2001, beloved for its pure hip hop style and clever album concept, which served as a fictional story, chronicling Ace's time spent at a satirical rap school named the "Institute of Disposable Arts". JCOR Records folded soon after the release, leaving it out-of-print, until being re-released in 2005 on Ace's self-established M3 label. The album closer, "No Regrets", led many fans to believe that it would be Ace's final album, because of the line ''"I don't know if it's the end, but yo, it might be"''. Ace killed the rumors by returning in 2004 with his fifth album ''[[A Long Hot Summer]]'', another highly acclaimed effort. The story concept, similar to that on his last release, served as a prelude to the story told on ''Disposable Arts'', chronicling the "Long Hot Summer" that led to his character's incarceration at the beginning of the ''Disposable Arts'' album. Rumors once again spread about a retirement, which were again squashed, when Ace announced the formation of his new rap crew named [[EMC (hip hop group)|eMC]], including himself, Punchline, [[Wordsworth (rapper)|Wordsworth]] and his protégé Strick. Ace remarked in a December 2006 interview that he would no longer record as a solo artist, only with eMC.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchclips.com/?page=8&id=2 |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 25, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930144613/http://www.dutchclips.com/?page=8&id=2 |archive-date=September 30, 2007 }}</ref> eMC's first group album, ''[[The Show (album)|The Show]]'', was scheduled for early 2007 but was released in February 2008 digitally and April 2008 physically.

In 2007, Masta Ace had a track included on the ''Official Joints'' mixtape, a compilation of previously unreleased tracks by various NYC rappers.<ref name="Allmusic" />

In 2009, Masta Ace joined forces with Boston rapper [[Ed O.G.]] to release ''[[Arts and Entertainment (Masta Ace and Edo G album)|Arts & Entertainment]]'' which was released on November 3, 2009.<ref>Fleischer, Adam [https://archive.today/20130209192819/http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=61392 Masta Ace and Edo G, Banned From TV] ''[[XXL Magazine]]'' November 2009.</ref> ''Arts & Entertainment'' got shortened to A&E which resulted in the cable TV channel [[A&E Network|A&E]] asking Masta and Edo to remove the symbol from their original album artwork. The albums already printed have been sold at live shows following the release of the record.<ref>Fox, Luke [https://archive.today/20120712164707/http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=140&csid2=946&fid1=44110 Conversations: Masta Ace and Edo G] at ''[[Exclaim!]]'' February 2010.</ref>

He is also featured on the track "Sminke" by the critically acclaimed Norwegian Hip Hop duo [[Karpe Diem]]. The title of the album is Aldri Solgt En Løgn (Never Sold a Lie).

== Legacy ==
Masta Ace is considered to be a highly skilled and influential MC – music journalist [[Peter Shapiro (journalist)|Peter Shapiro]] describes him as "one of the great pure New York MCs",<ref name="Shapiro, Peter 2005, p. 247" /> and [[Allmusic]] describes him as "truly an underappreciated rap veteran and underground luminary".<ref name="Allmusic" /> Commenting on how Masta Ace is sometimes overlooked despite his skill, [[Rolling Stone]] says, "even the most avid fan of raw hip-hop lyricism can sometimes neglect to mention Masta Ace alongside hard-bitten champs such as [[Rakim]], [[KRS-One]], [[Big Daddy Kane]], [[Slick Rick]] and [[Kool G Rap]]".<ref name="rollingstone.com" /> [[Eminem]] mentions Masta Ace as one of his influences in his book ''The Way I Am'', saying, "Masta Ace had amazing storytelling skills – his thoughts were so vivid".<ref name="Eminem 2008, p. 20">Eminem, with Sacha Jenkins, 2008, ''The Way I Am'', Dutton Adult, p. 20.</ref>
