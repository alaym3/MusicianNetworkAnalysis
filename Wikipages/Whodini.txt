'''Whodini''' is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] group that was formed in 1982.<ref name="Tortorici"/> The [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]]-based trio consisted of vocalist and main lyricist Jalil Hutchins; co-vocalist John Fletcher, a.k.a. Ecstasy (who wore a [[Zorro]]-style hat as his trademark); and [[turntablism|turntable]] artist DJ Drew Carter, a.k.a. Grandmaster Dee.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Connolly|first1=John|title=Whodini Headlines Peace Hip Hop '09: August 1st|url=http://www.cityofboston.gov/news/Default.aspx?id=4297|website=Cityofboston.gov|access-date=7 September 2016}}</ref>

Coming out of the fertile New York rap scene of the early 1980s, Whodini was one of the first rap groups to add a [[R&B]] twist to their music, thus laying the foundation for a new genre - [[new jack swing]]. The group made its name with good-humored songs such as "Magic's Wand" (the first rap song accompanied by a video), "The Haunted House of Rock", [[Friends (Whodini song)|"Friends"]], "Five Minutes of Funk" and "Freaks Come Out at Night". Live performances of the group were the first rap concerts with the participation of [[breakdance]] dancers from the group [[UTFO]]. [[Russell Simmons]] was the manager of the group in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/defjam/exhibition/simmonsrush/index.html|title=Russell Simmons and Rush Productions| website=Rmc.library.cornell.edu |access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref>

The group has released six studio albums. 14 singles of the group hit the charts of the American magazine ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. Four albums of the group were [[platinum certification|certified Platinum]] by [[RIAA]].

==Career==
===Early years===
Whodini was among the first hip hop groups to cultivate a high-profile national following for [[hip hop music]] and made significant inroads on [[urban radio]].<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=366/7}}</ref> They were contemporaries of other hip hop groups such as [[Grandmaster Flash & the Furious Five]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]], [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[The Fat Boys]] and [[Warp 9]]. The group signed with London-based independent record label [[Jive Records]] in 1982;<ref name="LarkinDM"/> they enjoyed a string of hits for several years, mostly charting on urban and [[R&B]] radio stations. The bulk of production on their releases was done by [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]], a bass player who also handled much of Run-D.M.C.'s early work.

In 1982, Whodini made a rap story with their debut single "Magic's Wand", an ode to rap radio pioneer [[Mr. Magic]],<ref name="LarkinDM"/> which became the first rap song to receive a music video.<ref name="complex">{{cite web| url= https://www.complex.com/music/50-greatest-rap-albums-1980s/whodini-escape|title=The Best Rap Albums of the '80s (by ROB KENNER, AL SHIPLEY, CRAIG JENKINS, DAVE BRY, DAVID DRAKE, LARRY HESTER, MICHAEL A. GONZALES) October 4, 2018| website=Complex.com |access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref> [[Synthpop]] and [[Electro (music)|electro]] pioneer [[Thomas Dolby]] helped produce this single.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> "Magic's Wand" also has the distinction of being one of Whodini's most-sampled songs.

On July 8, 1983, the group released the self-titled album ''[[Whodini (album)|Whodini]]'' on vinyl and audio cassettes.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The album was produced by influential German pioneer [[Conny Plank]] at his own studio near Cologne, Germany. On CD, the album was released in the United States only in 2010. The second single, "Haunted House of Rock", was released in time for Halloween, 1983.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Whodini combined the goofy fun of [[The Fat Boys]] with the virtuosity of [[Run-D.M.C.]] to create what is the rap equivalent of horror movies. Heavy on the sound effects, the song is full of references to various famous monsters and boogymen - Dracula, Bloody Mary and the Invisible Man all show up.<ref>[https://www.latestnewssouthafrica.com/2020/12/23/john-fletcher-of-whodini-music-group-has-passed-away/ John Fletcher Of Whodini Music Group Has Passed  Away] Latestnewssouthafrica.com</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.songfacts.com/facts/whodini/the-haunted-house-of-rock|title=The Haunted House Of Rock by Whodini|website=Songfacts.com |access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>

===''Escape''===
In 1984, the group released the second album ''[[Escape (Whodini album)|Escape]]''.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The entire album was fully produced by [[Larry Smith (producer)|Larry Smith]]. From the laid back groove titled "Five Minutes of Funk" to "Friends", a cynical story of betrayal sampled everywhere from [[Nas]]' "If I Ruled the World (Imagine That)" to [[2Pac]]'s "Troublesome '96", to harder edged singles "Freaks Come Out at Nite" and "Big Mouth".<ref name="complex"/>

Many of these songs were also groundbreaking in [[hip hop|hip hop culture]], as each one of the songs told a unique story from the urban perspective. The album ended up being certified for [[platinum certification|platinum]]-level sales by the [[RIAA]], selling over one million albums upon its release.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The instrumental version of "Five Minutes of Funk" was used as the theme music for [[WNYC]] TV show, ''Video Music Box'',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0426817/|title=Video Music Box (1983– )|website=IMDb.com|access-date=2016-01-10}}</ref> an influential early hip hop [[music video]] show. The album is out of print. On May 17, 2011, a deluxe version of ''Escape'' was released on CD with nine bonus tracks.

===''Back in Black''===
In 1986, the group released a third album ''[[Back in Black (Whodini album)|Back in Black]]'',<ref name="LarkinDM"/> fully produced by Smith. A number of songs from the album received heavy local New York airplay, such as "Funky Beat" and the controversial "I'm a Ho". "Fugitive" was guitar-driven [[funk]] and "Last Night (I Had a Long Talk With...)" was introspective. Paul Kodish, drummer of Pendulum, was featured on the album.

===Touring===
From 1982 to 1986, the group was at its most productive; they toured with the more successful bands such as [[Run-D.M.C.]], [[LL Cool J]], [[The Fat Boys]], and other prominent hip hop, R&B and funk bands.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The group was involved in the first Fresh Fest tour, which was the first hip hop tour to play large coliseums nationwide.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> In July 1986, they appeared at [[Philadelphia]]'s Spectrum Stadium in front of an audience of 18,000.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher= Reed International Books Ltd | location= London| page= 420| id= CN 5585}}</ref> They were the first rap act and break dance troop to tour in the UK and Europe, with [[UTFO]] also appearing with them as their break dance act.<ref name="LarkinDM"/>

===''Open Sesame'' and the New School===
By 1987, the group had earned its share of gold singles and albums. With the fourth album ''[[Open Sesame (Whodini album)|Open Sesame]]'', its final release of the 1980s,<ref name="LarkinDM"/> the group had turned away from their once-playful simple beats and catchy rhymes of the [[old school hip hop|old school]], and instead became vocally harder and more instrument-driven, with guitars and horns and bells. They even began to sample, as a snippet of Cheryl Lynn's "[[Got to be Real]]" is heard on the song "Now That Whodini's Inside the Joint". Smith again produced the entire album except for two tracks, "Be Yourself" and "I'm Def (Jump Back And Kiss Myself)", produced by Sinester.

This [[new school hip hop|new school]] style had been similarly done almost a year previously, on the multi-million selling debut albums by [[L.L. Cool J]] and the [[Beastie Boys]], as many groups had already turned to the kind of rap and [[rock music]] that crossed over easily, and ''Open Sesame'' failed to produce any real hits.

Although the group was still obligated to Jive Records, for the next few years the band eked out its tenure by occasionally only releasing singles, including "Anyway I Gotta Swing It" for the ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' movie soundtrack.

===The 1990s to present===
In the 1990s, the band made an attempt at a comeback, and in that same year the group signed with [[MCA Records]] and released the fifth album ''[[Bag-A-Trix]]'' in 1991, which failed to have commercial impact, as it tried again to reinvent using the then-current sound of [[new jack swing]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Smith produced six of the tracks on the album, two of which co-authored with the band Major Jam Productions, which separately produced the other four tracks, and Fresh Gordon made music for the other four songs.

In mid-1994, the group scored a hit single with "It All Comes Down to the Money",<ref name="LarkinDM"/> which was co-produced by [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] DJ [[Terminator X (DJ)|Terminator X]] on his album ''[[Super Bad (Terminator X album)|Super Bad]]''.

Talks with [[Def Jam Recordings]] for a new deal stalled, and in 1996, the group was signed by [[Jermaine Dupri]] to his then [[Columbia Records]]-distributed [[So So Def Recordings]] imprint. As a child in the 1980s, Dupri did a brief stint as a dancer for the group.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.stopthebreaks.com/gems/jermaine-dupri-dancer-whodini/|title=Hip-Hop Gem: Jermaine Dupri Started Out As A Dancer For Whodini (by HAO NGUYEN) September 6, 2014| website=stopthebreaks.com |access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>

Their sixth album ''[[Six (Whodini album)|Six]]'' produced one single, "Keep Running Back", and appeared briefly on the R&B chart. The album was fully produced by Dupri, except for three tracks, which were created by Dave Atkinson and Andy "Red Spyda" Thelusma.

Since the ''Six'' album, the group has not released any new music, but its older songs have been featured in many various old school compilations and three greatest-hits collections have been released: ''The Jive Collection, Vol. 1'' in 1995, ''Rap Attack'' in 2003, and ''Funky Beat: The Best of Whodini'' in 2006, which featured the seven-minute "Whodini Mega Mix", which was a medley of some of the biggest hits.

In recent years, Whodini still tours occasionally, and its old records still surface on [[pop music|pop]] and R&B radio, especially during old-school mix shows. The group's records have now become sample sources for contemporary emcees such as [[Nas]], [[Master P]], [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]], and [[MF Doom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-breaks.com/search.php?term=whodini&type=0 |title=Whodini |website=The-breaks.com |access-date=2016-01-10}}</ref>

In October 2007, Whodini was an honoree at the 4th [[Vh1]] [[Hip Hop Honors]].

In March 2012, Whodini was featured in Season 5 Episode 3 of the [[TV One (U.S. TV network)|TV One]] hour-long music documentary series, ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]''.

In August 2012, Whodini was presented with the Icon Award by the Underground Music Awards.

In October 2012, Whodini was inducted into the 4th annual [[Long Island Music Hall of Fame]].

On August 16, 2018, the group was awarded the Hip-Hop Icon Award at the third Black Music Honors ceremony held at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center in [[Nashville]], [[Tennessee]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://ifclapboardscouldtalk.com/2018/09/09/highlights-from-the-2018-black-music-honors|title=Highlights From the 2018 Black Music Honors (by Cherie Saundersposted) September 9, 2018| website=ifclapboardscouldtalk.com |access-date=2019-03-01}}</ref>
