When questioned about the progression between their second EP ''[[The North Stands for Nothing]]'' and their 2012 studio album ''[[This Is the Six]]'', guitarist Welsh said that they have not changed their sound drastically, saying "it's super heavy but then it's melodic too".<ref name="SB"/>

==Band name==
In an EMP interview in 2013, the singer Taylor explained that the name of the band originated from a magazine with a story of a woman murdering her husband while he slept, and changed it to "she" instead of "he." 
Taylor also explained that he likes to view the name as a reference to a vehicle or a ship sunken in the bottom of the sea, as ships and other vehicles are often referred with the feminine pronoun.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Taylor |first=Lawrence |subject-link=Lawrence Taylor |interviewer=Jan C.
