'''Deftones''' is an American [[alternative metal]] band <!-- DON'T mention the Grammy Award in the first sentence -->formed in [[Sacramento, California]] in 1988. It was formed by [[Chino Moreno]] (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), [[Stephen Carpenter]] (lead guitar), [[Abe Cunningham]] (drums), and Dominic Garcia (bass). During their first five years, the band's lineup changed several times, but stabilized in 1993 when Cunningham rejoined after his departure in 1990; by this time, [[Chi Cheng (musician)|Chi Cheng]] was bassist. The lineup remained stable for fifteen years, with the exception of keyboardist and turntablist [[Frank Delgado (American musician)|Frank Delgado]] being added in 1999. The band is known as one of the most [[experimental rock|experimental]] groups to have come from the alternative metal scene.<ref name="insinginterview" /><ref name="nmebeaumont" />

Deftones have released nine albums since their inception. After the lineup settled in 1993, the band secured a recording contract with [[Maverick Records]], and subsequently released their debut album ''[[Adrenaline (album)|Adrenaline]]'' in 1995. Promoting the album by touring exhaustively with other bands in the scene, Deftones managed to gain a dedicated fan base through word of mouth. Their second album ''[[Around the Fur]]'' was released in 1997, reached chart positions along with its singles, and became the band's first to receive certification from the [[RIAA]]. The band found even further success with their third album ''[[White Pony]]'' (2000), which saw a transition away from their earlier, more aggressive sound into a more experimental direction. Its lead single "[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]" is the band's most commercially successful single, and the track "[[Elite (song)|Elite]]" won a [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]]; it was also the band's first of three albums to be certified platinum in the United States. Their [[Deftones (album)|self-titled fourth album]] was released in 2003. While the group's critical success continued, sales proved to be lackluster compared to ''White Pony''.

Deftones' fifth studio effort, ''[[Saturday Night Wrist]]'', was released in 2006. While critically acclaimed, the album’s production was marred by creative tensions and personal issues within the band, some of which influenced its material. In 2008, while Deftones were working on an album tentatively titled ''[[Eros (Deftones album)|Eros]]'', Cheng was involved in a traffic collision. As a result, he was left in a minimally conscious state until his death in 2013 of [[cardiac arrest]]. After Cheng's accident, Deftones halted production on ''Eros''. [[Quicksand (band)|Quicksand]] bassist [[Sergio Vega (bassist)|Sergio Vega]], who had filled in as a touring member to replace Cheng, later became his permanent replacement.

The band released ''[[Diamond Eyes]]'' in 2010 and embarked on a triple-headline tour with [[Alice in Chains]] and [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] throughout North America. Their seventh and eighth albums, ''[[Koi No Yokan]]'' (2012) and  ''[[Gore (album)|Gore]]'' (2016) respectively, saw the band continue to move in an increasingly experimental direction and were released to critical acclaim. Their latest album, ''[[Ohms (album)|Ohms]]'', was released on September 25, 2020, receiving  significant critical praise.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason |date=September 18, 2020 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/9449413/deftones-chino-moreno-ohms-interview | title=How Deftones Outlived Countless Rock Trends — And Are 'Bigger Than They've Ever Been'|access-date=September 22, 2020}}</ref> They have sold more than 10 million albums worldwide.<ref name="RIAA"/>

Cavalera also collaborated on "Headup", a tribute to Wells.<ref>Interview with Chino Moreno and Max Cavalera, ''[[Metal Hammer]]'', September 1997.</ref> Although not yet a member of the band, Delgado was credited as "audio" on five of the album's tracks.

"When we went in to make this record, we really didn't have a set idea of what we wanted to come out with", said Moreno in a 1998 interview with ''Chart'' magazine. However, he felt that the album "fell into place" once the band had settled into the studio.<ref name="chart">Bromley, Adrian.

An interview with the band in ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' described the recording process of ''White Pony''. After a break from touring, the band spent four months in the studio writing and recording it, the longest amount of time they had dedicated to an album thus far. Moreno said that the majority of this time was spent trying to write songs, and that the writing of "[[Change (In the House of Flies)]]" was the turning point where the band began working as a unit. Despite being pressured to release the album sooner, the band decided to take their time. Cheng explained, "We didn't feel like we had anything to lose, so we made the record we wanted to make." Moreno did not have an overall lyrical theme in mind, but made a conscious decision to bring an element of fantasy into his lyrics: "I basically didn't sing about myself on this record. I made up a lot of story lines and some dialogue, even. I took myself completely out of it and wrote about other things".<ref name="AP">Deftones&nbsp;– Ride On [interview].

The song was released as a single and included as the new opening track of a re-released ''White Pony'' on October 3, 2000. The new release still had "Pink Maggit" as the final track and featured altered white cover art. Not entirely happy with re-releasing the album, the band negotiated to have "Back to School" made available as a free download for anyone who had already bought the original album. Moreno noted that "Everybody's already downloaded our record before it came out anyway, otherwise I'd be kind of feelin' like, 'Man, why [are] we putting [out] all these different versions of the record?' [...] that's the best way we can actually get this song out to the people who already purchased this record, for free basically.

On June 23, 2009, Deftones announced on their official website that ''Eros'' would be delayed indefinitely, saying, "As we neared completion on ''Eros'', we realized that this record doesn't best encompass and represent who we are currently as people and as musicians. And although those songs will see the light of day at some point, we collectively made the decision that we needed to take a new approach, and with Chi's condition heavy on our minds while doing so. We needed to return to the studio to do what we felt was right artistically".

A website—One Love for Chi—was launched by Deftones fan Gina Blackmore on March 10, 2009, about four months after Cheng's accident.

All proceeds raised by the website were donated to his family so they could provide him the best possible medical care.<ref>{{cite web|title=Deftones - "One Love For Chi" Official Fundraiser|url=http://oneloveforchi.com/|publisher=Oneloveforchi.com|access-date=May 12, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100622154000/http://oneloveforchi.com/ |archive-date=June 22, 2010}}</ref>

Teaming up with bands [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] and Alice in Chains, Deftones went on tour in the fall of 2010 in the United States and Canada.

The tour included a limited edition series of silk-screened art prints promoting each show individually, created by the poster artist [[Jermaine Rogers]].

In 2017, Chino Moreno revealed that Deftones had begun writing material for their ninth studio album, which he stated hoped would be out sometime in 2019. Chino went on to state that the band would be going in a different direction than they had on ''Gore'' and that he would be taking a step back from leading the song writing to allow Stephen Carpenter and Abe Cunningham to be more involved in the material on the new album. In May 2018, Moreno was again asked about the new material and he stated the songs were "considerably heavier" than those on ''Gore''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Trendell |first1=Andrew |title=Deftones give update on powerful new album |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/deftones-give-update-powerful-sounding-new-album-2315251 |access-date=7 October 2018 |magazine=NME |date=May 15, 2018}}</ref> That same month, Deftones embarked on a South American tour with support from [[Quicksand (American band)|Quicksand]] and [[Deadly Apples]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalanarchy.com/2017/12/15/deftones-announce-2018-south-american-dates/|title=Deftones Announce 2018 South American Dates|last=caemanamelio|date=December 16, 2017|website=Metal Anarchy|language=en|access-date=December 25, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://voir.ca/chanceuxqueteux/2018/05/12/deadly-apples-en-tournee-avec-rob-zombie-et-marilyn-manson/|title=Deadly Apples : En tournée avec Rob Zombie et Marilyn Manson|last=Tremblay|first=Yanick Klimbo|website=Voir.ca|language=fr-CA|access-date=December 25, 2019}}</ref>

The music critic Johnny Loftus wrote, "Rock critics usually reserve a special place for Deftones above or at least away from the rest of the turn-of-the-century metal movement [....] Deftones have always seemed more curious, more willing to incorporate traditionally revered sounds like [[Washington, D.C. hardcore|D.C. hardcore]] and dream pop into their Northern California alt-metal".<ref name="Loftus2005">{{cite web|first=Johnny|last=Loftus|url= {{AllMusic|class=album|id=r789046|pure_url=yes}}|website=Allmusic|title=allmusic ''B-Sides & Rarities'' - Overview|date=2005|access-date=December 18, 2008}}</ref> Peter Buckley, the author of ''The Rough Guide to Rock'', called the band "one of the most primal, powerful, and experimental" bands in the alternative metal scene.{{sfn|Berelian|2003|p=281}}

Moreno's lyrics were described by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as "suggesting emotions rather than announcing them".<ref>{{cite magazine|author=Farley, Christopher John|title=Off to the Races|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,49445,00.html|magazine=Time magazine|date=May 9, 2000|access-date=November 30, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203161232/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C49445%2C00.html|archive-date=December 3, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Moreno himself described his lyrics as ambiguous and sometimes impersonal, saying: "I like to be ambiguous when writing to a certain extent, and throwing something so brash [as Chi's accident] against that and playing with it. And also making it sound dimensional. Giving the feeling off that it is raw and it is emotional, but it's not just connected with our personal story. It's not merely about our career and our lives, it's bigger than that. When I hear the music, I get inspired to paint the lyrical pictures you describe, but I'm not always talking about myself".<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/04377-deftones-interview-diamond-eyes |title=Features &#124; A Quietus Interview &#124; A New Kind Of Sincerity: Deftones Interviewed |magazine=The Quietus |access-date=November 20, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717104825/http://thequietus.com/articles/04377-deftones-interview-diamond-eyes |archive-date=July 17, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The band's legacy has been compared to [[alternative rock]] group [[Radiohead]], with some dubbing Deftones "The Radiohead of metal".<ref name=insinginterview>{{cite web |last=Chan |first=Cherylene |url=https://www.insing.com/feature/interview-deftones-abe-cunningham-we-just-let-things-happen-for-better-or-worse/id-d7743f00/ |title=Deftones' Abe Cunningham: "We just let things happen, for better or worse" |publisher=Insing.com |access-date=May 4, 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705235121/https://www.insing.com/feature/interview-deftones-abe-cunningham-we-just-let-things-happen-for-better-or-worse/id-d7743f00/ |archive-date=July 5, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="nmebeaumont"/>
