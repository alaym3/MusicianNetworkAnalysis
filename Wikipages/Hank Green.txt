====Brotherhood 2.0 (2007)====
{{Main|Vlogbrothers}}
From January 1 to December 31, 2007, Hank and his brother [[John Green (author)|John]] ran a video blog project titled Brotherhood 2.0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18272166|title=Brothers Reconnect Using Video Blogging|publisher=[[NPR]]|work=All Things Considered|date=January 20, 2008|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/2008/01/07/august-2007-archive/|title=August 2007 Archive|publisher=Fox News|date=August 14, 2007|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref> The original project ran every week day for the entire year, with the premise that the brothers would cease all text-based ("textual") communication for the year and instead converse by daily [[video blogging|video blogs]], made available to the public via their [[YouTube]] channel ''Vlogbrothers'' and on their website.<ref>{{cite web|last=Shore|first=Jennifer|url=http://mashable.com/2012/11/09/youtube-vlogbrothers/|title=How 2 Brothers Turned a YouTube Experiment Into a Charitable Mission|publisher=Mashable|date=November 9, 2012|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

====Post-Brotherhood 2.0 (2008–present)====
In 2008, John and Hank met up with their fans, known as "[[Nerdfighteria|Nerdfighters]]". The first gathering was a last-minute decision, but despite the short three-day notice, nearly a hundred people attended. In August, John and Hank were invited to the Google office in Chicago to talk about the project.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXGHeq05tgs Nerdfighters: Insider View from a YouTube Persona], Google Tech Talks, YouTube</ref> That same day, they filled the [[Harold Washington Library]] with about four hundred young adults.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080906004404/http://cbs2chicago.com/local/vlog.brothers.youtube.2.791256.html Vlogbrothers bring message to Chicago], [http://cbs2chicago.com/video/?id=47659@wbbm.dayport.com video], [[WBBM-TV|CBS 2 News]], August 8, 2008</ref> Following John's book tour for his third novel, ''[[Paper Towns]]'', the brothers went on a national tour in November. With events in 17 different cities, they met Nerdfighters at local libraries and community centers. During this tour, Green released his first album of Nerdfighter-themed songs, titled ''So Jokes''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dftba.com/hank-green-releases-so-jokes/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405175722/http://dftba.com/hank-green-releases-so-jokes/|archive-date=April 5, 2009|title=So Jokes|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

The Green brothers have been interviewed on [[PotterCast]], and have been recurring keynote speakers at the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' fan convention [[LeakyCon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2009/3/29/leakycon-2009-keynote-speaker-annoucement-nosh-time-with-the-nerdfighters|title=Keynote Speaker Announcement|date=March 29, 2009|publisher=[[The Leaky Cauldron (website)|The Leaky Cauldron]]}}</ref>  The Brotherhood 2.0 project succeeded in its original mission. The two brothers have come to communicate more thoroughly with each other, and have a larger influence in each other's lives than before the project was initiated. The brothers talked on the phone once or twice a year before Brotherhood 2.0, but, according to Hank's wife Katherine, they now "talk almost every day."<ref name=Missoulian>{{cite news|last1=Akimoff|first1=Timothy Alex|title=Big Sky nerds: Brothers still speak for underdog|url=http://missoulian.com/news/state-and-regional/big-sky-nerds-brothers-still-speak-for-underdog/article_b2cf4926-2e1a-5df0-8d7b-8b821d7b8257.html|access-date=November 1, 2014|newspaper=The Missoulian|date=August 10, 2008}}</ref> John and Hank continued to post vlogs every Tuesday and Friday on their channel.

=== ''Crash Course'' ===
In January 2012, Hank and [[John Green (author)|John Green]] created the educational [[YouTube]] channel [[Crash Course (YouTube)|''Crash Course'']], as part of the site's [[YouTube Original Channel Initiative|Original Channel Initiative]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gigaom.com/2012/02/01/youtube-education-channels/|title=Cool for school: Education is a big hit on YouTube|last=Roettgers|first=Janko|date=February 1, 2012|website=gigaom.com|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref> The channel features several educational courses based on the high school curriculum, and first launched with series focusing on Biology and World History. According to John, the brothers see ''Crash Course'' "as an introduction, as a way to get kids excited about learning, not as an attempt to replace traditional classroom materials."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/childrens/childrens-authors/article/66676-john-green-to-crash-course-fans-read-your-boring-textbooks.html|title=John Green to Crash Course Fans: 'Read Your Boring Textbooks'|website=PublishersWeekly.com|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref> Their goal is to create "resources that allow for more valuable interaction in the classroom,"<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/karenhua/2015/06/23/education-as-entertainment-youtube-sensations-teaching-the-future/#1732dbd54ca1|title=Education as Entertainment: YouTube Sensations Teaching The Future|last=Hua|first=Karen|website=Forbes|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref> with hopes that the channel will one day span the entire high school curriculum.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=http://www.recode.net/2014/11/6/11632628/vlogbrothers-bring-crash-course-videos-to-pbs-digital-studios|title=Vlogbrothers Bring "Crash Course" Videos to PBS Digital Studios|last=Chmielewski|first=Dawn|date=November 6, 2014|website=Recode|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref>

The channel was initially hosted by the two brothers, with Hank focusing on the science courses and John teaching the humanities courses. The channel has since expanded to welcome new hosts such as [[Craig Benzine]], [[Phil Plait]], and [[Emily Graslie]] into its roster, and has launched new courses such as Astronomy, Physics, and Philosophy.<ref name=":2"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.openculture.com/2016/02/crash-course-philosophy-hank-greens-fast-paced-introduction-to-philosophy-gets-underway-on-youtube.html|title=Crash Course Philosophy: Hank Green's Fast-Paced Introduction to Philosophy Gets Underway on YouTube|website=Open Culture|language=en-US|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref><ref name=":4" /> As part of YouTube Kids, a separate ''Crash Course: Kids'' channel was launched in March 2015, with [[Sabrina Cruz]] hosting a Science course geared toward a younger audience.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/youtube-kids-app-set-to-debut-in-bid-to-provide-family-friendly-destination-1201437758/|title=YouTube Kids' App Set to Debut in Bid to Provide 'Family Friendly' Destination|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=February 20, 2015|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=May 20, 2016}}</ref>

=== ''SciShow'' ===
{{Main|SciShow}}

Green created the science YouTube channel ''SciShow'' in January 2012, which, like ''Crash Course'', was initially funded by the online video website.<ref name=":7" /> The channel features a series of videos focused on several scientific fields such as chemistry, physics, and biology, as well as interviews and trivia shows with experts. Green aims for ''SciShow''<nowiki/>'s content to be approachable and to dispel the idea that science is an inherently difficult subject.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2016/05/05/hank-green/|title=How YouTuber Hank Green is bringing STEM to a new generation|last=Weinberger|first=Aliza|website=Mashable|date=May 5, 2016|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> Like ''Crash Course'', ''SciShow'' is meant to be supplementary to the traditional educational experience, with Green's goal being "to be good at one thing so teachers can be good at other things."<ref name=":6" />

''SciShow'' is primarily hosted by Green, though it has since expanded with Michael Aranda taking on additional hosting duties, as well as with occasional appearances by [[Lindsey Doe]] and [[Emily Graslie]]. A spin-off channel, ''SciShow Space'', was launched in April 2014 to cover space topics,<ref name=":8" /> and is hosted by Green, Reid Reimers, and Caitlin Hofmeister. A third channel, ''SciShow Kids'', premiered in March 2015.<ref name=":5" /> It is aimed at children between the ages of 3 and 6 and is hosted by Jessi Knudsen Castañeda.<ref name=":3" />  Late in 2016, its patrons on Patreon chose a topic for a new channel, ''SciShow Psych'', which launched in March 2017. It is hosted by Hank Green and Brit Garner who teach about the human brain and aim to provide clear and reputable psychology information.<ref name=":12">{{Citation|last=SciShow|title=SciShow Psychology: Coming Soon!|date=February 27, 2017|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kTOUlnCyXxA|access-date=March 11, 2017}}</ref>

{{blockquote|text=The advertising system is so ingrained that there isn't a technological solution, but there might be a cultural solution. Cultural changes need activation energy and they need catalysts. Nerdfighteria has become kind of a pretty powerful force, so I feel like Nerdfighteria can be the activation energy and Subbable could be the catalyst.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dYlbz77uzI|title= Introducing Subbable|first=Green|last=Hank|date=July 26, 2013|publisher=vlogbrothers|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref>}}

In March 2015, [[Patreon]], another subscription-based crowdfunding platform, acquired Subbable and added Subbable's creators into its fold, with the bulk of the acquisition money going to match up to $100,000 in pledges to ease the transition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/03/16/patreon-acquires-artist-subscription-competitor-subbable/|title=Patreon Acquires Artist Subscription Competitor Subbable|last=Buhr|first=Sarah|website=TechCrunch|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> Although talks of the two companies joining forces had been discussed since their launch, they only got serious after Amazon announced a change in its payment services, which would lead to Subbable creators losing subscribers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexpham/2015/03/16/patreon-acquires-subbable-aligning-youtube-stars/#6d6fd0ab377f|title=Patreon Acquires Subbable, Aligning the YouTube Stars|last=Pham|first=Alex|website=Forbes|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> As part of the deal, the Green brothers received a small portion of Patreon and Hank signed on as an unpaid advisor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/2z97zz/i_am_hank_green_founder_of_subbable_a/cpgt6t5|title=I am Hank Green, founder of Subbable (a crowdfunding platform), here with Jack Conte, founder of Patreon (a crowdfunding platform that just acquired Subbable).

=== NerdCon: Stories ===
On the subject of stories, Green has said:

{{blockquote|text=Stories, of course, are an easy thing to love. They're how we understand the world ... how we pass information from person to person. I'm serious when I say that I think stories are a bit part of what makes us human, so when I was thinking of things I wanted to celebrate, that stuck out.<ref name="dailydot; NerdCon: Stories">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/nerdcon-minneapolis-preview-hank-green/|title= NerdCon takes a different approach to the domain of the nerd|first=Rae|last=Votta|date=October 8, 2015|publisher=dailydot.com|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref>|sign=|source=}}

Following VidCon's success, Green launched a new conference, NerdCon: Stories, focusing on all types of storytelling media, in 2015. The first NerdCon: Stories was held at the [[Minneapolis Convention Center]] in Minneapolis, Minnesota, during October 9–10, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/hank-green-launches-nerdcon-nerdfighters/|title=Hank Green is launching NerdCon for Nerds and Nerdfighters|date=March 27, 2015|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> The two-day conference attracted around 3,000 attendees, and featured guests such as Hank and [[John Green (author)|John Green]], [[Patrick Rothfuss]], [[Maureen Johnson]], [[Maggie Stiefvater]], [[John Scalzi]], and the ''[[Welcome to Night Vale]]'' cast and crew, among other storytellers, authors, performers, and musicians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/entertainment/hank-green-nerdcon-minneapolis/|title=Scenes from the inaugural NerdCon|date=October 12, 2015|website=The Daily Dot|access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref>

==Other projects==
===Music===
During the Brotherhood 2.0 project, Green accepted a challenge to perform an original song bi-weekly (known as "Song Wednesdays") and he has continued, though less frequently, to write, record, and perform songs since then. His songs include "I'm Gonna Kill You," "Baby, I Sold Your Dog on eBay," and "What Would Captain Picard Do?". Green's first successful song was "Accio Deathly Hallows", which was featured on YouTube's front page preceding the release of the [[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows|final ''Harry Potter'' book]],<ref name="Perspectives">{{cite book | title=Critical perspectives on Harry Potter | url=https://archive.org/details/criticalperspect00heil | url-access=limited | publisher=Routledge | author=Heilman, Elizabeth E. | year=2009 | location=New York | pages=[https://archive.org/details/criticalperspect00heil/page/n332 320] | isbn=978-0-415-96484-5}}</ref> and has been viewed over two million times.<ref>{{cite AV media|last=Green|first=Hank|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvvFiZyEyTA|title=July 18: Accio Deathly Hallows (no spoilers)|publisher=YouTube|work=VlogBrothers|date=July 18, 2007|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

===2D-Glasses===
In 2011, Green created [[3D film#Health effects|"2-D" glasses]], which allow one to watch [[3-D film|3-D movies]] in 2-D. The glasses were originally created for those who [[3-D film#Criticism|experience discomfort]] watching 3-D movies (such as Green's wife) and consist of either two right or two left lenses from a pair of regular [[stereoscopy|3-D glasses]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Browning|first=Skylar|url=http://missoulanews.bigskypress.com/missoula/two-ds-better-than-three/Content?oid=1470342|title=Two D's better than three Hank Green finds a place in Hollywood's excess|newspaper=Missoula Independent|date=June 16, 2011|access-date=July 21, 2014}}</ref>
