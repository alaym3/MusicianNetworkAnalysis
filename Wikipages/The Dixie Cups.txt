"Iko Iko", a New Orleans traditional song, was recorded in 1964 but later was released as a single early in 1965.<ref name="Betrock, Alan 1982"/> Barbara Hawkins had heard her grandmother sing the song, first recorded in 1953 as "Jock-a-Mo" by [[James "Sugar Boy" Crawford]]. Barbara Hawkins: "We were just clowning around with it during a session using drumsticks on ashtrays. We didn't realize that Jerry and Mike had the tapes running". Leiber and Stoller overdubbed a bassline and percussion, and released it. It was The Dixie Cups' fifth and last hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://performingsongwriter.com/mardi-gras-music/|title=The Story Behind ''Mardi Gras Mambo'' and ''Iko Iko''|author=Hutchinson, Lydia|website=PerformingSongwriter.com|access-date=February 13, 2018}}</ref>

In 1965, the Dixie Cups moved to the [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]] record label before a recording hiatus in 1966 temporarily halted their careers.<ref name="Romanowski, Patricia 1995 pp.271"/> In 1974 the Hawkins sisters moved from New York to New Orleans, where they both began successful modelling careers.<ref name="Romanowski, Patricia 1995 pp.271"/> Barbara Ann and Rosa Lee also worked as make-up artists. Joan Johnson retired from the group, unable to manage the stress from traveling. The Dixie Cups continued to tour as a trio with another New Orleans singer, Beverly Brown, replacing Joan Johnson who became a [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah's Witness]] and left her music career.<ref name="amg1"/> Brown who had recorded two solo discs in the early 1960s stayed as the third member until the early 80s when she became ill and was replaced by Dale Mickle. The Dixie Cups continue to perform and make personal appearances. The current line-up consists of the Hawkins sisters along with Athelgra Neville, sister of the singing [[The Neville Brothers|Neville Brothers]].

On August 29, 2005, [[Hurricane Katrina]] swept through [[Louisiana]], flooding much of New Orleans and displacing Barbara and Rosa Hawkins, who subsequently relocated to Florida. Joan Johnson relocated to [[Texas]]. Two years later in April 2007, The Louisiana Music Hall Of Fame honored The Dixie Cups for their contributions to Louisiana music by inducting them into The [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].

Joan Marie Johnson died in New Orleans of congestive heart failure on October 3, 2016 at the age of 72.<ref>Blisten, John (2016) "[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/joan-marie-johnson-chapel-of-love-singer-dead-at-72-w444354 Joan Marie Johnson, 'Chapel of Love' Singer, Dead at 72]", ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', October 11, 2016.
