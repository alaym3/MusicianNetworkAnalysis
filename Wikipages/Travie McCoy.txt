===Solo career===
[[File:TravisMcCoy2007 (cropped).jpg|thumb|McCoy in 2007]]

McCoy began a solo career in 2010.

He went through his second stint in a detox program, and claimed that his [[Opioid receptor|opiate receptors]] had been cleaned. He said of the experience, "I feel like a layer of shit has been peeled off of my brain."
