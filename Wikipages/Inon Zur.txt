He has been nominated for numerous awards, and has won three—a Telly Award in 1997 for Best Score on ''[[Power Rangers: Turbo]]'', a Game Audio Network Guild award in 2004 for Best Original Instrumental track for ''[[Men of Valor]]'', and a Hollywood Music in Media Award in 2009 for Best Original Song – Video Game for ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Inon Zur was born in [[Israel]]. At the age of five, he was trying to compose harmonies with his mother's singing, and became inspired by classical music.<ref name="TXBint"/> He learned to play [[French horn]] as a child, studied piano by the age of eight, and was studying composition by the age of ten.<ref name="TXBint"/><ref name="GS"/> He graduated from the Music Academy of Tel Aviv, and spent four years in the Israeli military. He emigrated to the United States in 1990 to study at the Dick Grove School of Music for a year, and then under private tutor [[Jack Smalley]], a television music composer, and others for two years at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].<ref name=GS/><ref name="RPGFint"/>

===Career===
Zur began his career in 1994 by working on soundtracks for movies, such as ''Yellow Lotus'', featured at the [[Sundance Film Festival]]. He signed on to compose for [[ABC Family|Fox Family]] for six years, and made soundtracks for various children's television shows, including ''[[Digimon]]'' and ''[[Power Rangers]]''. By 2002, he estimated that he had composed the soundtrack to over 360 ''Power Rangers'' episodes.<ref name="RPGFint"/> He won his first award during this period in his career, a Telly Award for his work on ''[[Power Rangers: Turbo]]''.<ref name="TURBOaward"/> While he enjoyed the work, he began to want to go work somewhere "more intriguing, more advanced, and basically a place that people really appreciate music more"; his agent overcame his initial reluctance and convinced him to work in the video games industry.<ref name="IGN2004int"/> His first video game soundtrack was 2000's ''[[Star Trek: Klingon Academy]]'', which he started composing for the game in 1997.<ref name=GS/> Zur moved on to prestigious titles, composing for the award-winning and critically acclaimed ''[[Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal]]'' in 2001 and ''[[Icewind Dale II]]'' in 2002, among many others. ''Icewind Dale II'' earned him the first of many nominations for video game music awards, that of the Game Audio Network Guild's Music of the Year award.<ref name="GANG"/> He continued to work on movies and television programs during these years, composing the soundtrack to ''[[Au Pair (film)|Au Pair]]'' in 1999 and the English version of the 2000 [[anime]] series ''[[Escaflowne]]''.<ref name="ZURtv"/>

Zur's latest movie soundtrack to date was that of 2001's ''[[Au Pair II]]''. He has worked on a few television series since then; his last traditional television soundtrack was for ''[[The Bachelor (US TV series)|The Bachelor]]'' in 2002, though he has composed music for three [[webisode]] series since then. He continued to work on numerous video games, including ''[[Prince of Persia: The Two Thrones]]'' in 2005 and ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'' in 2007.<ref name="ZURgames"/> He has garnered several nominations for video game music awards, including his first win, for ''[[Men of Valor]]'' in the Best Original Instrumental track category of the 2004 Game Audio Network Guild awards.<ref name="GANG2004"/> His latest released titles have been ''[[Fallout 3]]'' and ''[[Prince of Persia (2008 video game)|Prince of Persia]]'' in 2008, and 2009's ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'' and the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[James Cameron's Avatar: The Game]]'', and 2015's ''[[Fallout 4]]''.<ref name="ZURgames"/><ref name="ZURbio"/> [[Music of Dragon Age: Origins|His work on ''Dragon Age: Origins'']] has earned Zur his third career award, that of Best Original Song – Video Game in the 2009 Hollywood Music In Media Awards.<ref name="HMM2009"/>

Zur penned the original musical score for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: War in the North]]'' video game, conducting and recording with the London Philharmonia Orchestra and the Pinewood Singers Choir at the legendary Abbey Road Studios in London. In an industry first, a dedicated concert of his music from ''War in the North'' was performed each evening at the 2011 ''[[Electronic Entertainment Expo]]'' (E3) in Los Angeles. The one-hour concert series was conducted by Zur and performed by The Hollywood Orchestra and Choir with the participation of The Lyris Quartet and solos from celebrated vocalist Aubrey Ashburn.

==Performances==
Zur's compositions have been played several times in live concerts. The first of these was a concert held in [[Seoul]], South Korea on May 30, 2006 dedicated to his music for ''[[Lineage II|Lineage II: Chronicle V: Oath of Blood]]''.<ref name="M4GLineageint"/> On August 20, 2008, music from his soundtrack to ''[[Crysis (video game)|Crysis]]'' was played in [[Leipzig]], Germany at a ''[[Video Games Live]]'' concert.<ref name="VGLconcert"/> His music from [[Music of Dragon Age: Origins|''Dragon Age: Origins'']] and ''Prince of Persia'' was performed at the September 26, 2009 "A Night in Fantasia 2009" concert in [[Sydney]], Australia by the [[Eminence Symphony Orchestra]]. Inon Zur was a special guest at the concert.<ref name="ESOconcert"/><ref name="ESOconcertprogram"/>

==Musical style and influences==
Zur's compositions frequently are focused on full orchestras, choir and, in some games like ''Prince of Persia'', ethnic instruments like Arabic flutes and the woodwind [[duduk]].<ref name="Varietypiece"/> He has often collaborated with the Northwest Sinfonia orchestra from Seattle, though he has on occasion used other orchestras.<ref name="IGN2004int"/> Whenever Zur works with a real orchestra, he always conducts it himself.<ref name="M4GLineageint"/> He has named some of his musical influences as classical artists such as [[Sergey Prokofiev]], [[Igor Stravinsky]], and [[Beethoven]], movie composers like [[John Williams]] and [[Jerry Goldsmith]], and jazz artists like [[George Gershwin]] and Henry McFeeny.<ref name="RPGFint"/> While he would one day like to compose music not intended to be part of a larger piece of media, he finds that the pressure of a deadline and the feedback from the developers are crucial in his development process.<ref name="RPGPint"/> He feels that his music sounds best when it is in the context given by the media it was made for, though he feels that performances of the music by itself transforms it "from just a soundtrack to an art form on its own".<ref name="GSint"/> Zur sometimes collaborates with other musicians while composing his game soundtracks; for example, he worked with [[Florence and the Machine]] to create a unique rendition of "I’m Not Calling You A Liar" for the ''[[Dragon Age II]]'' soundtrack.<ref name="DA2"/>

Zur typically is brought in to compose for a game once it is mostly complete, though he notes that that is earlier than for films and television—where nothing changes after he starts besides post-production effects—making video game music composition a more "flexible" process. He finds that it is "crucial" for him to play a game before he can compose music for it, even if it only a development version.<ref name="RPGFint"/> Rather than compose music based around the setting in the game where it will be played, Zur composes music around the emotion that he wants the player to feel at that point in the game.<ref name="IGN2004int"/> While he feels that music composition technology has come far enough in recent years to no longer be a limiting factor in his music, he does feel that the music budgets for games limit what he can create.<ref name="Playint"/> Zur feels that he is considered in the industry to be a very fast composer, which he attributes to his tendency to compose music "intuitively", rather than spending a lot of time planning it out.<ref name="M4GLineageint"/> When not composing, Zur likes to play video games, especially those he has composed for, as well as play basketball and spend time with his family.<ref name="PALGNint"/> The types of projects that he would like to work on in the future that he has not yet done are children's games and soundtracks incorporating jazz music.<ref name="Playint"/>
