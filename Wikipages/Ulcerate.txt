==History==

===Early days (2000&ndash;2005)===
The core membership of Ulcerate, including Jamie Saint Merat, Michael Hoggard and Mark Seeney, formed in 2000 under the name "Bloodwreath". In early 2002, guitarist Jared Commerer and vocalist James Wallace were added to the line-up while Seeney departed. The band began writing material for its debut recording, ''Demo 2003'', and changed its name to Ulcerate prior to its release.<ref name=wachtourak>{{cite web |url=http://www.last.fm/music/Ulcerate/+wiki |title=Ulcerate's Biography |author=wachtourak |work=[[Last.fm]] |access-date=19 November 2009}}</ref> {{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}  In 2004, the band released its second demo, ''The Coming of Genocide''.  Both demos were subsequently compiled and released by The Flood Records and Deepsend Records under the title ''The Coming of Genocide''.<ref name=bio1>{{cite web |url=http://www.ulcerate-official.com/html/band.php |title=Ulcerate: Biography |work=Ulcerate Official Website |author=Saint Merat, Jamie |access-date=20 November 2009}}</ref> {{unreliable source?|date=September 2013}}

===''Of Fracture and Failure'' and ''Everything is Fire'' (2006&ndash;2009)===
In early 2006, Ulcerate signed with [[Neurotic Records]]. Vocalist James Wallace left the band in 2006 as the band was preparing to record its first album, ''[[Of Fracture and Failure]]''. Ben Read was recruited to fill the vacant vocal position. In contrast with Wallace's lower-pitched growls, Read relied on higher-pitched screams, reminiscent of hardcore vocals. Jared Commerer also left the band and was replaced by guitarist Michael Rothwell. ''Of Fracture and Failure'' was recorded and mixed by Jamie Saint Merat and Michael Hoggard. It was mastered by Alan Douches at West West Side Studios, New York, US. The album artwork was created by Jamie Saint Merat.<ref name=wachtourak/>

In 2008, Read and Rothwell departed the band, with Oliver Goater recruited as Ulcerate's new guitarist and bassist Paul Kelland assuming vocal duties. Kelland's approach returned the band to a lower-pitched vocal style.  Ulcerate then started writing and recording its second album, ''[[Everything Is Fire]]''. The album was acknowledged by critics for its unique approach to death metal, with [[Allmusic]]'s Phil Freeman praising ''Everything Is Fire'' for incorporating the "percussive intricacy of [[Isis (band)|Isis]]", "intricate scaffold of jagged, art-metal guitar", and use of repetition that was closer to [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]] than [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]].<ref name="allmusic eif">{{cite web|last=Freeman|first=Phil|title=Ulcerate: Everything Is Fire|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/everything-is-fire-mw0000814267|work=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=7 December 2013}}</ref>

===''The Destroyers of All'' and ''Vermis'' (2010&ndash;2014)===
In April 2010, Ulcerate announced that it was writing songs for a new album. Oliver Goater parted ways with Ulcerate in late 2010, and was replaced by William Cleverdon. The band released its third  album, ''[[The Destroyers of All]]'', on 25 January 2011, through Willowtip Records. The album was released only "as the core 3 writing members," and did not feature Oliver Goater who left the band prior to the recording of the album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/ulcerate-part-ways-with-live-guitarist-the-destroyers-of-all-album-artwork-and-release-date-revealed-track-available-for-download|title=ULCERATE Part Ways With Live Guitarist; The Destroyers of All Album Artwork And Release Date Revealed, Track Available For Download|website=Bravewords.com|access-date=16 November 2020}}</ref>
