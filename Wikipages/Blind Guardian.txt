'''Blind Guardian''' is a German [[power metal]] band formed in 1984 in [[Krefeld]], [[West Germany]].<ref name="History">{{cite web |url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/new_version/popups/history.html |title=Band: How it started... |author=Blind Guardian  |access-date=15 July 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070630081851/http://www.blind-guardian.com/new_version/popups/history.html |archive-date = 30 June 2007}}</ref> They are often credited as one of the seminal and most influential bands in the [[power metal]] and [[speed metal]] subgenres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/blindguardian.htm |title=No Life Till Metal |publisher=Nolifetilmetal.com |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.rockhard.de/index.php?smod=p209Wz1iMUIfo2qAo2D9pz9wn2uupzDhLzShMUZhMTI0LJyfIzyyqlMapz91pRyRCKWbK2WuozDzL29hqTIhqRyRCGR0AGHzp3IwnUA0pzyhMm1PoTyhMPOUqJSlMTyuovL%3D]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080413123624/http://www.rockhard.de/index.php?smod=p209Wz1iMUIfo2qAo2D9pz9wn2uupzDhLzShMUZhMTI0LJyfIzyyqlMapz91pRyRCKWbK2WuozDzL29hqTIhqRyRCGR0AGHzp3IwnUA0pzyhMm1PoTyhMPOUqJSlMTyuovL%3D |date=13 April 2008 }}</ref> Nine musicians have been a part of the band's line-up in its history, which has consisted of singer [[Hansi Kürsch]], guitarists [[André Olbrich]] and [[Marcus Siepen]], drummer Frederik Ehmke since 2005, and bassist Johan Van Stratum since 2021.

Blind Guardian is a part of the [[Music of Germany#Heavy metal|German heavy metal scene]] that emerged in the mid-1980s. The band was formed in 1984 as '''Lucifer's Heritage''' by Kürsch (then also bassist), Olbrich, other guitarist Markus Dörk and drummer [[Thomas Stauch]]. Dörk and Stauch both left the following year, and were replaced by Christof Theißen and Hans-Peter Frey respectively, who left as well before the end of the year. In 1987, Siepen joined and Stauch returned; under this line-up, which lasted 18 years (the longest in the band's history), the band changed their name to Blind Guardian and released their first album, ''[[Battalions of Fear]]'', in 1988.

Over the releases, Blind Guardian established themselves as a notable successful band and as pioneers of the power metal movement. In 1996, Kürsch stopped acting as the band's bassist to focus on vocals. Various session members replaced him, mainly [[Oliver Holzwarth]]. However, in 2005, Stauch left the band, disapproving of Blind Guardian's transition into a more complex [[Progressive metal|progressive]] sound with a heavy use of backing vocals, and was replaced by Ehmke.

Most of Blind Guardian's albums were well received by fans and critics alike: ''[[Somewhere Far Beyond]]'' (1992), ''[[Imaginations from the Other Side]]'' (1995), and ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' (1998), are especially seen as influential works. The music is mostly composed by Kürsch and Olbrich together, and the lyrics, written by Kürsch, are mostly inspired by the fiction of fantasy authors such as [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Michael Moorcock]], [[Stephen King]], and [[Robert Jordan]], as well as traditional [[legend]]s and [[Epic poetry|epic]]s.<ref name="Middle-earth">Bradford Lee Eden.

McFarland, 2010. {{ISBN|0-7864-4814-8}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7864-4814-2}}. 215 pages</ref> Over the years a theme has developed which personifies the band members as travelling storytellers, leading fans to refer to the band affectionately as "The Bards".

==History==

===Formation as Lucifer's Heritage (1984–1987)===
Blind Guardian was formed in 1984 in [[Krefeld]], [[West Germany]], by [[Hansi Kürsch]] (vocals, bass) and [[Andre Olbrich]] (guitar) under the name Lucifer's Heritage, with Markus Dörk (guitar) and [[Thomen Stauch]] (drums). The band briefly expanded into a [[quintet]] with the addition of a second lead vocalist, Thomas Kelleners. However, after three months Kelleners left the band in a mutual agreement.<ref>{{cite web|title=Lucifer's Heritage on MusicMight|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/germany/krefeld/lucifers+heritage#bio|publisher=Musicmight.com|access-date=2 August 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829234354/http://musicmight.com/artist/germany/krefeld/lucifers+heritage#bio|archive-date=29 August 2011}}</ref> Lucifer's Heritage first released two [[demo (music)|demos]] in 1985 and 1986, despite undergoing chaotic lineup changes: Dörk and Stauch were replaced by Christof Theißen and Hans-Peter Frey, respectively. Finally, in 1987, Marcus Siepen joined and Thomen came back to form the lineup which would stay consistent for the next 18 years.

===Name change and rise to success (1988–1996)===
After Lucifer's Heritage signed a contract with [[No Remorse Records]], the band changed their name to Blind Guardian to avoid any speculations about [[Satanism]] (in a bio it was stated that they also wanted to distance themselves from the [[black metal]] movement, as their demos were placed in with black metal albums at local record shops). The band's new name was inspired by the [[Fates Warning]] album ''[[Awaken the Guardian]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Band|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/band/|publisher= Blind-guardian.com|access-date=25 November 2017}}</ref> They released their debut album ''[[Battalions of Fear]]'' in 1988, which was essentially a [[speed metal]] album heavily influenced by [[Helloween]].<ref name="Metalstorm Review">{{cite web |url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/review.php?review_id=3736&page=&message_id=|title=Battalions of Fear Review|publisher=Metalstorm.ee|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> These two German bands had close ties, and Helloween founder [[Kai Hansen]] made a guest appearance on Blind Guardian's second LP, ''[[Follow the Blind]]'' (1989), where the band revealed some [[thrash metal]] influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalkings.ru/reviews/blind-guardian/blind-guardian.htm |title=Metalkings.com |publisher=Metalkings.ru |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref><ref name="Soundofmetal Review">{{cite web|url=http://soundofmetal.se/index.php?page=blindguardianfollowtheblindreview|title=Follow the Blind Review|publisher=Soundofmetal.se|access-date=17 February 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308071640/http://soundofmetal.se/index.php?page=blindguardianfollowtheblindreview|archive-date=8 March 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their third LP, ''[[Tales from the Twilight World]]'' (1990), had a much more melodic and "epic" feeling, with usage of [[choir]] and classical music influence.

Blind Guardian signed with [[Virgin Records]] in 1991, and released their fourth studio album ''[[Somewhere Far Beyond]]'' in 1992 and the live album ''[[Tokyo Tales]]'' in 1993. [[Flemming Rasmussen]], former [[Metallica]] producer, began working with the band in 1994, producing their fifth studio album ''[[Imaginations from the Other Side]]'', released in 1995, and ''[[The Forgotten Tales]]'', an album that contained half covers and half original work, released in 1996.

===Later years and departure of Thomen Stauch (1997–2009)===
[[File:Blind Guardian Kürsch.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Lead vocalist [[Hansi Kürsch]]]]
In 1998, Blind Guardian released their epic album ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]''. "Complete with anthemic choruses, spoken word story lines, and plenty of bombastic power metal punctuating every dramatic turn", says [[Allmusic]]'s Vincent Jeffries, "Nightfall in Middle-Earth is perhaps Blind Guardian's most triumphant".<ref name="Allmusicguide review1">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r396625|pure_url=yes}}|title=Nightfall in Middle-Earth Review|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> A [[concept album]] based on [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Silmarillion]]'',<ref name="Middle-earth"/> Blind Guardian's music demonstrated some [[folk rock]] influence, but also featured heavy use of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]-style layered backing vocals. Since ''Nightfall'', bass has been played by sessional member [[Oliver Holzwarth]], and Hansi has been able to devote all his attention to singing. ''Nightfall'' was also the last Blind Guardian album produced by Rasmussen.

''[[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|A Night at the Opera]]'', named after [[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|the Queen album]], was released four years later. On this album, the band's sound lacked almost all influence of their original speed metal. Power and progressive metal abound, with over the top orchestral backing and a consistent vocal and guitar layering throughout.<ref name="Allmusicguide review2">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r579741|pure_url=yes}}|title=A Night at the Opera Review|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=17 February 2008}}</ref> Though not a true concept album, many of the lyrics dealt with the common themes of religion and relations between human and divine powers. It was followed by a live album in 2003 and a DVD, ''[[Imaginations Through the Looking Glass]]'', in 2004, which was the last recorded Blind Guardian material to feature [[Thomen Stauch]] on drums. He left the band due to musical differences and was replaced by Frederik Ehmke. The first album with Ehmke was ''[[A Twist in the Myth]]'', which came out in 2006.

Blind Guardian participated in the soundtrack for the ''[[In the Name of the King: a Dungeon Siege Tale]]'' [[fantasy movie]] ([[Uwe Boll]]), which came out in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imhotep.no/?did=9074224&aid=9069487 |title=Various Artists – In the Name of the King. Soundtrack review |publisher=Imhotep.no |access-date=15 July 2011}}</ref> The band also recorded a theme song for ''[[Sacred 2 Fallen Angel]]'' [[role-playing video game]], the sequel to ''[[Sacred (video game)|Sacred]]''.<ref>[http://www.the-following.com/page.php?show=news&view=bg]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108003451/http://www.the-following.com/page.php?show=news&view=bg |date=8 January 2008 }}</ref>

"[[A Voice in the Dark (song)|A Voice in the Dark]]" was the next single from Blind Guardian, released on 25 June 2010.
On 30 July 2010 the album followed, called ''[[At the Edge of Time]]''. The band started "The Sacred Worlds and Songs Divine Tour 2010", the European dates featured the opening acts [[Enforcer (band)|Enforcer]] and Steelwing.  The US dates had [[Holy Grail (band)|Holy Grail]] and [[Seven Kingdoms (band)|Seven Kingdoms]] and later they were announced that they would play at [[Wacken Open Air]] in 2011.

On 21 July 2011 [[Hansi Kürsch]] announced on Blind Guardian's official website that they were working on an orchestral album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2011/07/21/harbinger-of-great-things-to-come/|title=Harbinger of great things to come|publisher=Blind-guardian.com|access-date=10 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924030418/http://www.blind-guardian.com/2011/07/21/harbinger-of-great-things-to-come/|archive-date=24 September 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=14162|title=Blind Guardian – Update On New Orchestral Album|publisher=Metalstorm.net|access-date=10 September 2011}}</ref> On 1 September 2011 [[Oliver Holzwarth]] joined [[Rhapsody of Fire]] as a full-time member, after 13 years as Blind Guardian's session bass player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsodyoffire.com/news.html?start=30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327062931/http://www.rhapsodyoffire.com/news.html?start=30|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 March 2013|title=Film score metal band Rhapsody Of Fire announces new bass player|publisher=Rhapsodyoffire.com|date=1 September 2011|access-date=5 June 2014}}</ref> On 27 January 2012 the band released a [[compilation album]], titled ''[[Memories of a Time to Come]]'', containing re-recorded and remixed songs from the band's entire [[Blind Guardian discography|discography]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/products/tontraeger/cd/3cd-digi/blind-guardian-best-of-deluxe.html |title=Nuclear Blast's "Memories of a Time to Come" page |publisher=Nuclearblast.de |access-date=12 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013145913/http://www.nuclearblast.de/en/products/tontraeger/cd/3cd-digi/blind-guardian-best-of-deluxe.html |archive-date=13 October 2011  }}</ref> and almost exactly one year later, on 28 January 2013, they released a [[box set]] called ''[[A Traveler's Guide to Space and Time]]'', which contained all of the bands' studio, live and compilation albums released from 1988 to 2004, as well as some previously unreleased material.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=A Traveler's Guide to Space and Time coming in February 2013 |publisher=Blind-guardian.com |url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/12/01/a-travelers-guide-to-space-and-time-coming-in-february-2013/ |access-date=22 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328103311/http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/12/01/a-travelers-guide-to-space-and-time-coming-in-february-2013/ |archive-date=28 March 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 11 July 2012 Hansi posted on the bands' official website that the band would cease touring after their show at the Rockharz festival in [[Ballenstedt]], which happened two days after the post.

He also mentioned that he really wanted to perform songs that they had never played live before when they return to touring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/07/11/where-do-we-go-from-here/|title=Where do we go from here?|publisher=Blind-guardian.com|access-date=31 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729045856/http://www.blind-guardian.com/2012/07/11/where-do-we-go-from-here/|archive-date=29 July 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In October 2013 the band were announced to be headlining the Out & Loud Festival in [[Geiselwind]] on 31 May 2014. On 18 October 2013 Hansi announced via a news post on the official website that he expected the new record to be fully produced and finished by May 2014. He mentioned that the production of the album was coming along well, and mentioned nine new songs by name (''Irish Hill'' [now titled ''Grand Parade''], ''Encrypted Time'', ''Prophecies'', ''Holy Grail'', ''Winter's Coming'', ''The Throne'', ''The Ocean'', and ''Outcast'') and two other songs with presumably uncertain titles, ''Song 9'' and ''Midtempo Song''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2013/10/18/a-sign-of-hope/|title=A sign of hope...|publisher=Blind-guardian.com|access-date=20 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016132426/http://www.blind-guardian.com/2013/10/18/a-sign-of-hope/|archive-date=16 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The tenth Blind Guardian album, titled ''[[Beyond the Red Mirror]]'', was released on 30 January 2015, its first single "Twilight of the Gods" having been released on 5 December 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/blind-guardian-to-release-twilight-of-the-gods-single-in-december-new-album-due-in-january/|title=Blind Guardian To Release 'Twilight Of The Gods' Single In December; New Album Due In January|work= Blabbermouth.net|date=10 October 2014|access-date=10 October 2014}}</ref> On 28 January 2015, two days before the release of ''Beyond the Red Mirror'', Blind Guardian announced on their official Facebook page that Barend Courbois is their new session/live bassist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/blindguardian/photos/a.373638827112.152258.21570237112/10152635591537113/?type=1&theater|title=Introducing our new bass player Barend Courbois|publisher=Facebook.com|date=10 October 2014|access-date=28 January 2015}}</ref>

===''Legacy of the Dark Lands'' and upcoming twelfth studio album (2017–present) ===

When asked in July 2017 about the next Blind Guardian studio album, Kürsch stated, "We haven't done too much songwriting for the next regular Blind Guardian album, but still, we've made some steps at least, and I can sense a strong change in comparison to what we did on the last album. There's one song called 'Architect of Doom', which is a real heavy song. Very powerful. Very thrashy at points. And there's another song called 'American Goth', which is kind of what you would expect from Blind Guardian, but yet the way we maintained the drums, for example, the way we maintained the orchestra, and that is a song with orchestra, again, it's so different. I'm pretty sure that there will be a significant change when you listen to these two albums and from that point of view, yes, ''Live Beyond the Spheres'' is the end of an era." He also stated that they are working on an orchestral album, which was originally scheduled to be finished and released in 2016,<ref>{{Cite web|title = Blind Guardian Discuss 'Beyond the Red Mirror,' Reveal New Orchestral Project|url = http://exclaim.ca/music/article/blind_guardian_discuss_beyond_red_mirror_reveal_new_orchestral_project|website = exclaim.ca|access-date = 29 December 2015}}</ref> but now due for release in 2019, followed by a "heavy album" to be released in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|title=BLIND GUARDIAN Frontman Talks Next Studio Album, Says 'Live Beyond The Spheres' Is 'The End Of An Era'|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/blind-guardian-frontman-talks-next-studio-album-says-live-beyond-the-spheres-is-the-end-of-an-era/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=27 July 2017|access-date=28 July 2017}}</ref>

The band's long-awaited orchestral album, ''[[Legacy of the Dark Lands]]'', was released on 1 November 2019, after Olbrich and Kürsch conceiving and writing the project since 1996.<ref name="legacyPresale">{{cite web|title=BLIND GUARDIAN TWILIGHT ORCHESTRA - start presale for "Legacy Of The Dark Lands" + reveal new trailer, tracklist and formats! |url=https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/news/details/6060917.71036.blind-guardian-twilight-orchestra-pre-order.html |work=[[Nuclear Blast]] |access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref><ref name="LegacyNuclearBlast">{{cite web|title=Legacy Of The Dark Lands |url=https://www.nuclearblast.de/en/label/music/band/discography/details/6032874.71036.legacy-of-the-dark-lands.html |work=[[Nuclear Blast]] |access-date=19 January 2020}}</ref> It features only Kürsch as a performer, together with the [[Prague Philharmonic Orchestra]], and as such is credited to the "Blind Guardian Twilight Orchestra" instead of the band's regular name.<ref>{{cite web|title=BLIND GUARDIAN'S TWILIGHT ORCHESTRA – LEGACY OF THE DARK LANDS – TEASER '|url=https://www.blind-guardian.com/beispielpost/ |work=Blindguardian.com|date=1 March 2019|access-date=1 January 2020}}</ref>

It was revealed in November 2021 that a new single, "Deliver Us From Evil", would be released on December 3rd, 2021, and that the band's forthcoming twelfth album would be released in September 2022. Kürsch told Nuclear Blast, "We know that the gap between now and the album release in late 2022 is painfully long. Neither we nor our label could defy the current worldwide, economic crisis. A long story short: There is no one to blame for this situation... Talking about anticipation, even though "Violent Shadows" and "Deliver Us From Evil" are indisputably fantastic tracks, rest assured: We won't let you wait another ten months with only two songs. I promise you, that you will always been blown away - cheers to the digital era and its endless possibilities. Oh, and the album title. There is one but I won't tell you yet. This would be giving away far too much right now."<ref>{{cite web |title=BLIND GUARDIAN - announce new single |url=https://www.nuclearblast.com/eu/band/news/blind-guardian-announce-new-single-30567 |website=Nuclear Blast |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[file:Blind Guardian 6.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Blind Guardian in 2006]]
Blind Guardian's first two albums, ''[[Battalions of Fear]]'' and ''[[Follow the Blind]]'', were more in the style of [[speed metal]] than their following works. Beginning with their third album ''[[Tales from the Twilight World]]'', Blind Guardian gradually began to write more complicated compositions focusing less on speed. As of their sixth album, ''[[Nightfall in Middle Earth]]'', Hansi stopped playing bass to focus on singing. At this point the band began to incorporate large amounts of orchestral arrangements, and utilized the technique of [[overdub]]bing, heavily influenced by the English rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref name="Queen influence">{{Cite journal|title=Queen influence |publisher=Blind Guardian official site |url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/new_version/band_members.php3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626035249/http://www.blind-guardian.com/new_version/band_members.php3 |archive-date=26 June 2007 }}</ref>

Blind Guardian's music features the [[staccato]] guitars and double [[bass drum]]ming characteristic of power metal, as well as the use of [[overdub]]s and numerous backing vocals to create a dense sound. This proved significant on all albums after the first two but most particularly on ''[[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

Another definitive feature of Blind Guardian music is frequent use of [[folk music|folk tunes]] and instruments, especially in [[power ballad]]s such as "Lord of the Rings", "The Bard's Song", "A Past and Future Secret", "Skalds and Shadows" and "Curse My Name", among others.

===Influences===
The band was initially inspired by their fellow countrymen [[Helloween]], and in its early releases also showed some influence from [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Metallica]].<ref name="Markus interview">{{Cite journal|title=Markus Siepen Interview |publisher= Metalkings.com|url=http://metalkings.com/reviews/blind-guardian/blind-guardian.htm|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> According to guitarist Marcus Siepen, during the songwriting for ''[[Follow the Blind]]'', they also used to listen to [[Bay Area thrash metal]] bands, such as [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Forbidden (band)|Forbidden]], resulting in a somewhat heavier sound.<ref name="Markus interview"/>

Starting with their third album, ''[[Tales from the Twilight World]]'', through ''[[Somewhere Far Beyond]]'' and ''[[Imaginations from the Other Side]]'', Blind Guardian gradually incorporated more influences from progressive and classical music. [[Queen (band)|Queen]] became a huge impact, in particular concerning the choir arrangements and harmonies, an effect most notable on ''[[A Night at the Opera (Blind Guardian album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.<ref name="Markus interview"/>

Singer Hansi Kürsch expressed the band's attraction to 1970s [[progressive rock]], for example early [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Gentle Giant]], and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]]. However, with regard to the genre, he sees the more direct influences in [[progressive metal]] bands, in particular [[Fates Warning]], [[Queensrÿche]], and [[Savatage]].<ref name="Hansi interview">{{Cite journal|title=Blind Guardian's music perseveres through many different eras |publisher=Powerlinemag.com/|url=http://www.powerlinemag.com/2012/08/31/blind-guardians-music-perseveres-through-many-different-eras/|access-date=7 March 2015}}</ref> The folklorist influences on ''[[Nightfall in Middle-Earth]]'' came mainly from British rock band [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].<ref name="Markus interview"/>

==Side projects==
Along with [[Jon Schaffer]], the leader and founder of [[Iced Earth]], Kürsch was a member of [[Demons and Wizards (band)|Demons and Wizards]], where he was the lead singer until its disbandment in early 2021.

Frederik Ehmke was a founding member of the band [[Sinbreed]], in which Marcus Siepen was a session member. Later on, during 2012, Marcus became a full member of the band.

After the tsunami that struck Japan on 11 March 2011, Blind Guardian worked with their former record company, [[EMI|EMI Music]], and auctioned off an exclusive studio session for two in the Twilight Hall Studio in Grefrath, Germany for charity. All of the proceeds were donated to the tsunami relief efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Build a better Bard's Song and help Japan|url=http://www.blind-guardian.com/2011/04/14/build-a-better-bards-song-and-help-japan/|publisher= Blind-guardian.com|access-date=2 May 2011}}</ref> The auction ended on 22 April 2011 with a final bid of £1,171.00.<ref>{{cite web|title=EMI Music Exclusive Studio Session with Blind Guardian|url=http://cgi.ebay.co.uk/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&item=270734893862|publisher=Cgi.ebay.co.uk|access-date=2 May 2011}}</ref>
