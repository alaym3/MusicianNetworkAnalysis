=== Career ===
At age 17, Tamko's parents bought her a [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] acoustic guitar from [[Costco]]. She taught herself to play by watching instructional DVDs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/freak-folk-rising-vagabons-laetitia-tamko-tames-her-demons-in-real-time-8549691|title=Freak-Folk Rising: Vagabon's Laetitia Tamko Tames Her Demons in Real Time|last=Lim|first=Audrea|date=April 27, 2016|website=The Village Voice|access-date=March 25, 2017}}</ref> In 2014 she started uploading her music to [[Bandcamp]] under the pseudonym Vagabon.<ref name=":0" /> In addition to vocals and guitar, Tamko played drums, keyboard, and synth on her 2017 album ''Infinite Worlds''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2017/02/16/515241684/first-listen-vagabon-infinite-worlds|title=Review: Vagabon, 'Infinite Worlds'|work=NPR.org|access-date=June 8, 2018|language=en}}</ref> In 2018 she was invited to open for [[Courtney Barnett]] on her North American summer tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2018/05/watch-courtney-barnett-perform-nameless-faceless-o.html|title=Paste Magazine|website=pastemagazine.com|language=en|access-date=June 8, 2018}}</ref>

Her [[Vagabon (album)|self-titled second album]] (Nonesuch, 2019) is self-produced and explores new sounds. It features digital sounds and synth strings alongside her delicate acoustic guitar. Most of the songs are written and played by the artist herself. "We reserve the right to be full when we’re on our own", she sings on her song "Every Woman".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/vagabon-vagabon/ |title=Laetitia Tamko leaps into new sounds and new horizons |date=October 20, 2019 |website=pitchfork.com |access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref> Released as a single and official video which can be seen on her website, the song is a young feminist's manifesto. The album also represents a move beyond the indie-rock scene, the shift in sound a "rejection of being pigeonholed."<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2019/10/15/757514260/stream-laetitia-tamko-on-the-making-of-vagabon |title='There Will Be No Darkness': Laetitia Tamko On The Making Of 'Vagabon' |date=October 20, 2019 |website=National Public Radio |access-date=October 20, 2019}}</ref>
