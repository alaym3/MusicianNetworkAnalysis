== History ==
=== Success with their 1958 song "Tequila" ===
"Tequila" was written by the [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Danny Flores]], although he was credited as '''Chuck Rio''' because he was under contract to another [[record label]] ([[RPM Records (United States)|RPM Records]]) at the time.<ref name="Larkin50"/> Flores, who died in September 2006, was known as the "Godfather of [[Latino rock]]".<ref name="telegram" /> Flores' "dirty sax" and his low-voiced "Tequila" are the hallmarks of the song.<ref name="latimes">[http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-passings24.1sep24,1,5389143.story?coll=la-news-obituaries ]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> Flores signed away the [[United States|US]] rights to the song but retained worldwide rights until his death.<ref name="ocregister">{{cite web|url=http://www.ocregister.com/ocregister/entertainment/abox/article_1283251.php |title=Danny Flores, 'Tequila' songwriter, dies at 77 |author=Pete Larsen |website=Ocregister.com |access-date=2013-10-15}}</ref> 

There are many [[cover version]]s of the tune, including a jazz version by guitarist [[Wes Montgomery]] in 1966. It has also been recorded by rappers [[A.L.T.]] and XL Singleton. The Champs also had success with instrumentals such as "[[Limbo Rock]]" and "El Rancho Rock". In 1985, "Tequila" featured prominently in the [[film]] ''[[Pee Wee's Big Adventure]]''. The Champs also recorded a sequel to "Tequila" entitled "Too Much Tequila".

=== 2020 band reunion ===
In 2020, group leader Dave Burgess resurrected The Champs for a new album, ''Tequila Party'', scheduled for November release. The LP contains 12 newly recorded tracks including a raucous "party" rendition of their signature hit plus seven new Burgess compositions. Prolific songwriter Burgess, who has in excess of 700 copyrights registered with BMI, wrote or co-wrote 14 songs on The Champs' first two Challenge Records LPs. "Tequila Party" is available at www.TheChampsOfficial.com.
