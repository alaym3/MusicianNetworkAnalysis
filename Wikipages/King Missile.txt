==History==

===King Missile (Dog Fly Religion)===
In [[1985 in music|1985]], writer [[John S. Hall]] began presenting his work at [[open mic]] [[poetry reading]]s. After three shows, Hall became a "featured" poet at the Backfence, a performance venue in [[Manhattan]]'s [[Greenwich Village, Manhattan|Greenwich Village]].<ref name="prindle">{{cite web

(2004). Album notes. In ''[[Mystical Shit & Fluting on the Hump]]'' [CD booklet]. [[New York City]]: Shimmy Disc.</ref> Hall asked his [[guitarist]] friend [[Dogbowl]] (Stephen Tunney) to augment his performances with original music.<ref name="prindle" /><ref name="hall" /> Dogbowl agreed, and with the addition of [[bassist]] Alex DeLaszlo, [[drummer]] [[R. B. Korbet]], and [[xylophone|xylophonist]] George O'Malley, King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) was born.

In 1987, the band went to the Noise New York [[recording studio|studio]] and in just ten hours recorded and mixed its debut album, ''[[Fluting on the Hump]].''<ref name="prindle" /> The [[record producer|producer]]/[[audio engineering|engineer]], [[Mark Kramer|Kramer]], released the album on his then-fledgling [[record label|label]], [[Shimmy Disc]].<ref name="prindle" /> The label sent the album to every [[college radio]] station that reported to ''[[College Media Journal]],'' and the album subsequently performed well on the [[College Music Journal#CMJ New Music Report|CMJ charts]].<ref name="prindle" />

In 1988, Hall and Dogbowl, along with [[cello|cellist]] [[Charles Curtis (musician)|Charles Curtis]] and new drummer [[Steve Dansiger]], recorded the second King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) album, the longer, more experimental, less "jokey"<ref name="prindle" /> ''[[They (album)|They]].'' Like its predecessor, the album was produced by Kramer and released on Shimmy Disc. According to Hall, "[the album] wasn't well received. Dogbowl was itching to make his own records, so we went our separate ways."<ref name="hall" /> Dogbowl went on to record [[Shimmy Disc discography|several albums for Shimmy Disc]].

===King Missile===
After Dogbowl's departure, Hall asked [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]] guitarist [[Dave Rick]] to help him put together a new band.<ref name="prindle" /> Rick recruited [[multi-instrumentalist]] [[Chris Xefos]], and Hall retained Dansiger on drums.<ref name="prindle" /> Hall dubbed the new lineup King Missile, dropping the parenthetical "Dog Fly Religion" subtitle "since that was [Dogbowl's] idea."<ref name="hall" /> In late [[1989 in music|1989]] and early [[1990 in music|1990]], the band recorded the album ''[[Mystical Shit]],'' and in 1990 released it on Shimmy Disc.<ref name="prindle" /> On the strength of the [[single (music)|single]] "[[Jesus Was Way Cool]]", the album hit No.&nbsp;1 on the CMJ charts, and the band was signed by a [[Record label#Major versus independent record labels|major label]], [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="prindle" /> This series of events led Hall to make a habit of [[joke|joking]], "'Jesus' got me signed to Atlantic Records."<ref name="hall" /> Around this time, King Missile was featured in the 1990 documentary [[Paul Devlin (filmmaker)|''CutTime'']], which chronicled the East Village music scene of the time.<ref>CutTime on DevlinPix</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.devlinpix.com/blog/2011-11-06/cuttime-king-missle-life-2-10 |title=CutTime - King Missile, "Life" (3 of 11) |publisher=DevlinPix |access-date=2013-02-22}}</ref>

Another lineup change occurred before the recording of King Missile's major-label debut, as Dansiger left the band and was replaced on drums by [[Hypnolovewheel]] member David Ramirez. The subsequent album, ''[[The Way to Salvation]],'' was released on April 16, 1991, and reached No.&nbsp;2 on the CMJ charts.<ref name="prindle" /> Atlantic promoted the album with the release of a single, "[[My Heart Is a Flower]]", and accompanying [[music video|video]].

After Ramirez left the group and was replaced by yet another drummer, [[Roger Murdock (musician)|Roger Murdock]], the band recorded a cover of  [[R.E.M.]]'s song "[[Get Up (R.E.M. song)|Get Up]]" for the album, ''[[Surprise Your Pig: A Tribute to R.E.M.]]'', released on June 22, 1992. This was followed by the band's second major-label album, ''[[Happy Hour (King Missile album)|Happy Hour]],'' released on December 15, 1992. The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the CMJ charts,<ref name="prindle" /> and its accompanying first single, "[[Detachable Penis]]", became a modest [[hit single|hit]], reaching No.&nbsp;25 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart.<ref name="billboard">{{cite web

  | publisher = [[Allmusic]]

  | access-date = 2008-05-21 }}</ref> Atlantic released videos for "Detachable Penis" and the subsequent singles "[[(Why Are We) Trapped?]]" and "[[Martin Scorsese (song)|Martin Scorsese]]", but neither follow-up single achieved the chart success of "Detachable Penis." According to Hall, the band realized that its hit [[song]] had drawn in many casual [[fan (person)|fans]] who didn't care about the rest of the group's material; thus, the band began to play the song "early in the [[concert|set]], so that the people who didn't like us could leave, and we could play for the people who cared. That worked out well. People did leave."<ref name="prindle" />

In 1993, the band contributed a song titled "Our Jungle" to the soundtrack of the film ''[[Surf Ninjas]]'' starring [[Ernie Reyes, Jr.]], [[Rob Schneider]], Nicolas Cowan and [[Leslie Nielsen]].

The band's third and final album for Atlantic was the eponymous ''[[King Missile (album)|King Missile]],'' released April 19, 1994. Neither the album nor its lead single, "[[Love Is... (song)|Love Is...]]", was a commercial success; consequently, the band was dropped from Atlantic, and broke up shortly thereafter because, according to Hall, "there was no reason to stay together."<ref name="farmboy">{{cite web

===King Missile III===
After the collapse of the second incarnation of King Missile, Hall decided to attend [[law school]].<ref name="prindle" /> He [[graduation|graduated]] ''[[Latin honors#Types|cum laude]]'' from the [[Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law]] in Manhattan,<ref name="heratylaw">{{cite web
  | title = Bios

  | access-date = 2008-05-22 }}</ref> and after graduation co-founded Heraty Hall, a [[law firm|firm]] specializing in [[entertainment law]].<ref name="prindle" />

In 1996, Hall released a "[[solo album]]", ''[[The Body Has a Head]],'' on the German label Manifatture Criminali. The album featured considerable input from multi-instrumentalists [[Sasha Forte]], [[Bradford Reed]], and [[Jane Scarpantoni]]. With these musicians, as well as ''They'' cellist Curtis, Hall formed a new band, King Missile III. On September 15, 1998, the new lineup released its "debut" album, ''[[Failure (King Missile album)|Failure]],'' on Shimmy Disc.

Curtis and Scarpantoni left the band after the release of ''Failure,'' and King Missile III continued as a trio, releasing two more albums: ''[[The Psychopathology of Everyday Life (album)|The Psychopathology of Everyday Life]]'' ([[Instinct Records]], January 21, 2003) and ''[[Royal Lunch]]'' (Important Records, September 21, 2004).

===King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) reunions===
Hall reunited with Dogbowl in 1995 for a tour as King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) for most of October and November of that year. The tour featured Hall performing spoken word with Sasha Forte on violin, followed by performance by Dogbowl and his band, and featuring Hall, Forte, Dogbowl and his band all performing together as King Missile (Dog Fly Religion) to headline the shows.

On March 18, 2010, Hall reunited with Dogbowl as King Missile (Dog-Fly Religion) for a one-time performance at Le Poisson Rouge in New York City. Multi-instrumentalist John Kruth, bassist [[Dave Dreiwitz]] of [[Ween]], and drummer [[Billy Ficca]] of [[Television (band)|Television]] joined the duo to round out the lineup.

===King Missile IV===
In September 2014, John S. Hall performed four shows with the band [[LoveyDove]] in Los Angeles. It was later decided that this was, in fact, a new incarnation of King Missile, and they settled on the name King Missile IV. This version of the group toured New Zealand in February 2015, and recorded a six-song EP, ''This Fuckin' Guy'', released on Powertool Records.

===King Missile reunions===
On June 25, 2015, Hall, Rick, and Murdock reunited for the first time in over twenty years for a performance at Shea Stadium in [[Bushwick, Brooklyn]]. They were joined by Rachel Swaner on keyboards and accordion. The set consisted of songs from throughout the various King Missile incarnations. Hall, Rick, and Murdock played several more shows along with keyboardist Brent Cordero between 2015 and 2019. On February 18, 2017, keyboardist and bassist Chris Xefos rejoined the group for a performance at The Gutter Bar in Brooklyn. On February 10, 2018, King Missile, featuring the lineup of Hall, Rick, Murdock, Cordero and Korbet performed at a benefit for radio station, [[WFDU]] at Rose Gold in Brooklyn. A show at Bowery Electric in New York City followed on June 21, 2018 featuring the lineup of Hall, Rick, Murdock, Cordero, and Korbet. On May 11, 2019, King Missile performed with Hall, Rick, Murdock, Cordero, and Matt Hunter at Hank's Saloon in Brooklyn. Dogbowl performed an opening set and also joined King Missile on stage for several songs.
