==History==

===Formation, ''Limitless'' EP and sign to Rise Records (2010–2011)===
{{main|Limitless (Crown the Empire EP)}}

Crown the Empire was formed in July 2010 by lead vocalist Andrew "Andy Leo" Rockhold<ref name=":0" /> (then Velasquez), keyboardist Austin Duncan, bassist Brandon Shroyer, drummer Alex Massey, rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist Hayden Tree, and lead guitarist/backing vocalist Brandon Hoover during their time together at Colleyville Heritage High School. The band played their first show at Compass Church in Colleyville, Texas, on July 10, 2010. A few months later unclean vocalist Zac Johnson joined the band, so Andrew Rockhold became the clean vocalist. The band was formed when "Brandon and Austin decided to start jamming together." The band's ultimate goal was to "be heavier than most bands in their area," while "bringing huge, poppy choruses to a genre that can become pretty stale." Originally, drummer Alex Massey filled the drumming position in the band, but he was soon replaced by their current drummer, Brent Taddie in May 2011, at the same time bassist Brandon Shroyer left the band, Zac Johnson took the bass. During 2011, the members of Crown the Empire also held an extensive search for another guitarist to join their band. They soon welcomed Bennett Vogelman (Benn Suede) to the band as the new lead guitarist/backing vocalist, Brandon Hoover switched to rhythm guitar, Hayden Tree switched to the bass and didn't concentrate to do backing vocals, Zac Johnson focused on performing only unclean vocals.

The band started recording their debut EP, ''Limitless'', in 2011. ''Limitless'' was released on iTunes on November 29, 2011.<ref name="limitless">{{cite web|title=Debut EP Limitless - Release Date And MORE|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G48h8a4ohcg|publisher=Crown the Empire}}</ref> Before recording, Zac Johnson left the band, clean vocalist Andrew Rockhold was now the only one vocalist at this moment.

On December 5, 2011, the band released a behind-the-scenes look at the filming for the band's then-upcoming music video for their song, "Voices", from their EP ''Limitless''.
