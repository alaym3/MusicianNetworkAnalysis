'''Ne Obliviscaris''' (Latin for "forget not"; [[Clan Campbell]] motto) are a six-piece Australian
[[progressive metal]] band from [[Melbourne]]. 
Formed initially as a four-piece in April 2003,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groundcast.com.br/interview-xenoyr-from-ne-obliviscaris/ | title=INTERVIEW: XENOYR FROM NE OBLIVISCARIS | website=Groundcast.com.br | accessdate=11 June 2016 }}</ref> the group was founded by Marc "Xenoyr" Campbell and Adam Cooper. The current line-up comprises vocalist Xenoyr, violinist and clean vocalist Tim Charles, guitarists Matt Klavins and Benjamin Baret, bassist Martino Garattoni and drummer Daniel Presland. To date, the band has released a demo, two extended plays and three studio albums. Their most recent album, ''[[Urn (Ne Obliviscaris album)|Urn]]'', was released on 27 October 2017.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years ===
Ne Obliviscaris were formed in April 2003 by vocalist Xenoyr and bassist Adam Cooper, later adding a second guitarist and a female soprano. Current vocalist/violinist Tim Charles followed in September 
2003. The band went through a number of line-up changes before releasing an independent demo, ''The Aurora Veil'', in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=19777 | title=The Aurora Veil | website=Progarchives.com | accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> The demo featured three songs which would later appear on their debut album. Their music, whilst being firmly rooted in extreme metal, shows influences from a range of musical styles, including death, black, thrash and melodic metal, as well as classical, jazz, avant-garde and flamenco.

Drummer Dan Presland left the band towards the end of 2011 and was replaced by Nelson Barnes. However, due to the distance between Queensland and Melbourne, Ne Obliviscaris parted ways with Barnes<ref>{{cite web | url=http://echoesanddust.com/2014/11/interview-dan-presland-of-ne-obliviscaris/ | title=Interview: Dan Presland of Ne Obliviscaris | website=Echoesanddust.com | accessdate=12 June 2016}}</ref> and Presland's return to the band was announced on 24 August 2012.

In June 2014, the band announced a [[crowdfunding]] campaign<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pozible.com/project/183510 |title=Ne Obliviscaris WORLD TOUR by Tim Charles, Xen and Dan Presland |website=Pozible.com | accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> to support a world tour with an initial target of $40,000 AUD.

The subsequent world tour saw Ne Obliviscaris return to Asia supporting [[Fleshgod Apocalypse]] as well as their first tours of Europe, the UK and North America where they supported British band, [[Cradle of Filth]]. They also played in India for the first time, where they headlined the B-School of Rock at the Unmaad Festival in Bangalore.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://headbangers.in/blog/ne-obliviscaris-to-headline-iim-bangalores-b-school-of-rock-2015/ | title=Ne Obliviscaris to headline iim bangalores b school of rock 2015 | website=Headbangers.in | accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref>

In July 2016, the band began a headlining tour of North America.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=124673| title=Ne Obliviscaris Prepares For North American Headlining Tour Dates | website=Metalunderground.com | accessdate= 17 July 2016}}</ref> with headlining shows in the U.K and Ireland following in October 2016 with Atlanta-based band Oceans of Slumber as support.

On 26 January 2017, the band released longtime bassist Brendan "Cygnus" Brown following allegations of domestic violence. Although they initially gave "irreconcilable personal differences" as the reason, they later explained that it was due in part to the allegations, but also because they believed that Brown needed help. Following accusations from a website that the band knew about Brown's violent behaviour and had been hiding it for years, the band explained that they were only aware of a domestic incident between Brown and his mother six years prior, and, after discovering the truth, immediately tried to get Brown to get help, and relieved him of his services to the band.<ref name=BrownArticle>{{cite web | url=http://www.metalinjection.net/latest-news/ne-obliviscaris-let-its-bassist-go-due-to-allegations-of-domestic-violence| title=NE OBLIVISCARIS Let Its Bassist Go Due To Allegations of Domestic Violence| publisher=Metal Injection | accessdate=16 December 2016}}</ref> Brown confirmed both the allegations and the band's statement to be true, adding that being released made him "realize the extent of damage I have caused to people over the years and how badly I need to get help to get my life back on track." He also stated that he had been physically and sexually abused by his mother since childhood, and that the trauma, which caused mental health disorders and ended in drug abuse, made him "an unpredictable character at times, and I have lashed out at people close to me both physically and verbally. I am deeply sorry to anybody that has been victim to this inexcusable behaviour". He also explained that the domestic violence incident with his mother six years prior was him fighting her back for the first time, and that he had not spoken to her since despite his mother harassing both him, his girlfriend, and the band on several occasions, which had led them to complain to the police.<ref name=BrownArticle/>

=== ''Urn'' (2017–present) ===
On 26 July 2017, the band announced that their new album, ''[[Urn (Ne Obliviscaris album)|Urn]]'', would be released on 27 October 2017, and released a music video for the track "Intra Venus".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgUn4EKLMnU|title=Ne Obliviscaris - Intra Venus (official music video)|last=Season of Mist|date=26 July 2017|accessdate=25 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> They also announced Robin Zielhorst, former member of [[Cynic (band)|Cynic]], Exivious, and Our Oceans, as their session bassist for the album. On 29 August 2017, they released another song from the album, "Urn (Part I) – And Within the Void We Are Breathless".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnyoRKNk7sQ|title=Ne Obliviscaris - Urn (Part I) - And Within the Void We Are Breathless (official premiere)|date=29 August 2017|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=25 January 2018}}</ref> On 10 October 2017, they released another song, "Urn (Part II) – As Embers Dance In Our Eyes".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9XLeME2Ie8|title=Ne Obliviscaris - Urn (Part II) - As Embers Dance In Our Eyes (official premiere)|last=Season of Mist|date=10 October 2017|accessdate=25 January 2018|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> ''Urn'' released on 27 October 2017, though it had been released to [[Patreon]] contributors a few days earlier.
 
On 22 June 2019 it was announced that the band's track, Intra Venus won the [[Independent Music Awards (IMAs)#2019 2|2018 Independent Music Award for Best Metal / Hardcore song]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://independentmusicawards.com/the-17th-independent-music-awards-winners/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190628024845/http://independentmusicawards.com/the-17th-independent-music-awards-winners/ |archive-date=28 June 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Use of crowdfunding ==
In addition to the campaign to fund their world tour, the band announced in March 2016 that they were starting a subscription based service through the [[Patreon]] micro-payments platform. This was in part inspired by [[Thy Art is Murder]] frontman, CJ McMahon, quitting the band for financial reasons.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://musicfeeds.com.au/news/ne-obliviscariss-patreon-campaign-partially-inspired-cj-quitting-thy-art-murder/ | title=Ne Obliviscaris's Patreon Campaign Was Partially Inspired By CJ Quitting Thy Art Is Murder | website=Musicfeeds.com.au | accessdate=13 June 2016}}</ref> The decision to use Patreon generated some controversy on social media platforms to which vocalist and violinist Tim Charles responded.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/news/1082303/ne-obliviscaris-violinist-responds-to-patreon-criticism | title=Ne Obliviscaris violinist responds to Patreon criticism | website=Killyourstereo.com | accessdate=15 June 2016}}</ref>
