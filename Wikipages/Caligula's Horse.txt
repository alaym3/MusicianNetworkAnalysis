== History ==
=== 2011: Formation and ''Moments from Ephemeral City'' / ''Colossus'' ===
In early 2011 Caligula's Horse was formed by Sam Vallen and Jim Grey. The band is named after the prized possession, [[Incitatus]], of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Caligula]] by Grey, who was studying ancient history and classical languages at university.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Morrison|first1=Robyn|title=Things You Didn't Know About Caligula's Horse (But Should)|url=http://heavymag.com.au/things-you-didnt-know-about-caligulas-horse-but-should/|website=Heavy Magazine|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> Initially Caligula's Horse consisted of only Grey on vocals and Vallen playing multiple instruments. Their debut album ''Moments from Ephemeral City'' was independently released on 2 April 2011. Vallen is credited with the songwriting, guitars, production, audio engineering, mixing and mastering.<ref>{{cite web|title=Moments from Ephemeral City (2011)|url=http://caligulashorse.com/album/moments-from-ephemeral-city/|website=Caligula's Horse (Official Site)|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> The band initially could not decide whether to continue or not, but after the online response for their album they decided they should expand their lineup for live shows.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Belling|first1=Alasdair|title=Caligula's Horse: Interview with Jim Grey|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interviews/1071707/caligulas-horse|website=Kill Your Stereo}}</ref> The lineup expanded to include Zac Greensill, Geoff Irish and Dave Couper. To showcase their new lineup a two-track EP Colossus was released in September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Charles|first1=Tim|title=The Tide, The Thief & River's End|url=http://caligulashorse.com/album/moments-from-ephemeral-city/|website=Welkin Records (Bandcamp)|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref>

===2012-2014: ''The Tide, the Thief & River's End'' ===
In mid 2012 the band entered the studio to commence their follow up LP. Their album ''The Tide, the Thief & River's End'' was released 13 October 2013 through Welkin Records. This was a [[concept album]] with each track listed in a chronological order to tell a story that refers to the uprising of rebels, called "The Tide", within the city of "River's End", and a journey of oppressed people finding a safe haven that has unfortunate similarities between the old and new city. "The Thief" is the only character who remains in the story from start to finish.<ref>{{Cite web|title = CALIGULA'S HORSE: Colourful, Energetic and Dynamic|url = http://www.prog-sphere.com/interviews/caligulas-horse-interview/|website = Prog Sphere|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US}}</ref>

The band undertook an intense touring schedule within Australia after the release of the album, and became known for their energetic live show and stage presence.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Caligula's Horse detail new album 'Bloom'|url = http://www.bombshellzine.com/2015/09/caligulas-horse-detail-new-album-bloom/|website = Bombshellzine.com|accessdate = 2015-12-02|language = en-US|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304110737/http://www.bombshellzine.com/2015/09/caligulas-horse-detail-new-album-bloom/|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> The band was part of Progfest Sydney 2013<ref>{{Cite web|title = Progfest Sydney lineup announced feat.

===2015-2016: ''Bloom'' ===
After their second album they gained the interest of the recording label, InsideOut Music, and signed on to release their third album through them. Prior to the release of the album the band toured around Australia with [[Tesseract (band)|TesseracT]] and played a mix of crowd favourites and unreleased songs off ''Bloom''. ''Bloom'' was released 16 October 2015<ref name=":2">{{cite web|title=Caligula's Horse|url=http://www.insideoutmusic.com/artist.aspx?IdArtist=848|website=Inside Out Music|accessdate=2 December 2015}}</ref> and in its debut week on the ARIA charts it reached number 16 on the Australian band's chart and 75 on the overall chart.<ref name=":0" /> It peaked at 73 on the iTunes Australian charts in its first week.<ref name=":1" /> The album cover was designed by Chris Stevenson-Mangos who was given the aim of creating "something colourful and vibrant, somewhat circular in design (no hard edges) but perhaps suggesting stained-glass, and showing lots of nature imagery".<ref>{{Cite web|title = Interview with Sam from Caligula's Horse|url = https://tomatrax.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/interview-with-sam-from-caligulas-horse/|website = Tomatrax|accessdate = 2 December 2015}}</ref>

On 30 May 2016, it was announced that Geoff Irish had left the band.<ref>{{Citation|url = http://www.lordsofmetal.nl/en/interviews/view/id/6180|accessdate = 5 March 2019|title = Lords of Metal ezine}}</ref> On 10 August 2016, Josh Griffin was announced as Irish's replacement.<ref>{{Citation|url = http://www.insideoutmusic.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=17229&IdCompany=8|accessdate = 5 March 2019|title = " Caligula’s Horse : introduce new drummer with 'Rust' play-through video "}}</ref> On 28 January 2017, rhythm guitarist Zac Greensill announced his departure to focus on his side project, ''Opus of a Machine''. He was replaced by Adrian Goleby, who had played bass in Arcane, Jim Grey's first band.

=== 2017-2019: ''In Contact'' ===
On 4 August 2017, the song ''Will's Song (Let the Colours Run)'' was released along with its music video on the 23 August, as a tease to their new album.

On 15 September 2017, the band published [[In Contact]], the first featuring Adrian Goleby and Josh Griffin, respectively their new guitarist and drummer, and the last to feature bassist Dave Couper, who quit the band the next year. ''In Contact'' received a highly positive acclaim, particularly in the progressive rock/metal community.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.angrymetalguy.com/caligulas-horse-in-contact-review/|title=Caligula's Horse - In Contact Review|last=Kronos|date=29 September 2017|website=Angry Metal Guy|access-date=14 December 2018}}</ref>

On 10 December 2018, Dave Couper announced his departure from the band, mainly for health and financial reasons, as well as other musical aspirations. On 5 March 2019, Dale Prinsse was announced as the new bassist. He was already known for having formerly being called "C-Horse's sixth member", helping them with the mixing and production of their albums, and for playing bass in former Caligula's Horse guitarist Zac Greensill's project ''Opus of a Machine''.

In September 2019, the band played their first four concerts in the [[Americas]].

===2020-present: ''Rise Radiant''  ===
On 22 May 2020 the band released their fifth album ''[[Rise Radiant]]''.<ref name=MetalOb /> This was preceded by the release of three singles from the album: ''The Tempest'', ''Slow Violence'', and ''Valkyrie''.

On 6 July 2021, the departure of Adrian Goleby was announced, the guitarist citing a will to "journey to the next stage of [his] experience of life". The band thanked him dearly for his contributions, declaring that they would not be seeking out for another guitarist for the time, with the band remaining a four-piece.

== Musical style and influences ==
The band has been described as [[progressive rock]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Caligula’s Horse Premiere New Song, "Marigold"  - Hard Rock & Heavy Metal News {{!}} Music Videos {{!}}Golden Gods Awards  {{!}} revolvermag.com|url = http://www.revolvermag.com/news/caligulas-horse-premiere-new-song-marigold.html|website = www.revolvermag.com|accessdate = 2 December 2015}}</ref> and [[progressive metal]].<ref name=":2" />
