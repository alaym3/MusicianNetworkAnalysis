'''Zita Swoon''' is a [[Belgian]] [[indie rock]] group. They entered the music scene of [[Antwerp]] in 1993, still under the name [[A Beatband]] with the EP ''Jintro Travels The Word In A Skirt''. The group is typical of the music scene in Antwerp, with members playing in numerous other groups. The best known member is singer, musician and composer [[Stef Kamil Carlens]], who founded the group together with Aarich Jespers and also played in [[Deus (band)|dEUS]]. 

The same group released ''Everyday I Wear A Greasy Black Feather On My Hat'' under the name [[Moondog Jr.]] in 1995. Shortly thereafter they encountered legal trouble over the name [[Moondog]] with [[Louis T. Hardin]], and changed it to Zita Swoon (Zita = intense, Swoon = desire). The success of this album was awarded with invitations to the [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands]], [[Pinkpop]] and [[Rock Werchter]] festivals. The same year they also appeared live on [[MTV]] in ''[[MTV's Most Wanted|Most Wanted]]'' with [[Michael Blair (musician)|Michael Blair]].

Their first appearance in the US was at the [[South by Southwest]] festival in 1998. Zita Swoon has played in numerous locations, from New York to the Belgian [[Rock Werchter]] festival, the [[Holland Festival]], as well as in [[Germany]]. In early 1999 their work was recognized by the Flemish government with a grant of 1.5 million Francs and the title [[Cultural Ambassador of Flanders]] (a title previously awarded to [[DAAU]] and [[Deus (band)|dEUS]]).

In 2009 Stef Kamil Carlens participated with Lexus Concert, a 'hybrid' concert where Stef does a crossover concert at Klara festival with a musician from a totally different style and background. The winner of Lexus concert wins a private try out concert on board a new Lexus RX 450h.
