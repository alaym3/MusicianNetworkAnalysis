==Development==
On the morning of 26 January 2017, the European dates of the tour were announced through Sheeran's social networks. Hours later through the same networks were announced the dates for Latin America. Tickets for the tour sold out quickly, prompting new dates to be added in London, Turin and Santiago. On 13 February 2017 it was announced that he would be part of the line up for a week of gigs at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in aid of the [[Teenage Cancer Trust]] taking place on 28 March 2017.<ref name="Royal">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/music/ed-sheeran-announces-huge-london-show-1974430|title=Ed Sheeran announces huge Royal Albert Hall show|first=Damian|last=Jones|publisher=NME.com|date=13 February 2017|access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> On 22 February 2017, Sheeran announced that [[Anne-Marie (singer)|Anne-Marie]] and Ryan McMullan would be the opening acts for the European dates.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.list.co.uk/article/88910-anne-marie-to-support-ed-sheeran-on-uk-and-europe-tour/|title=Anne-Marie to support Ed Sheeran on UK and Europe tour|publisher=The list|date=22 February 2017|access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> On 8 March 2017, Sheeran announced the North American leg.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7717183/ed-sheeran-announces-48-date-north-american-divide-arena-tour|title=Ed Sheeran Announces 48-Date North American Arena Tour|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=8 March 2017|access-date=13 March 2017}}</ref> [[James Blunt]] was announced as the opening act, except for Indianapolis and Cleveland, where the opener was [[Joshua Radin]].

Lauv served as the opening act in Asia in November. On 28 June 2017, Sheeran announced a stadium tour across Europe. After the initial announcement, tickets sold quickly, which prompted new dates in Cork, Dublin, Manchester, Glasgow, Newcastle, London, Cardiff, Amsterdam, Paris, Gothenburg, Munich, Zürich, Vienna, and Warsaw.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zumic.com/ed-sheeran-adds-2018-tour-dates-europe-uk-ticket-presale-sale-info|title=Ed Sheeran Adds 2018 Tour Dates for Europe and UK: Ticket Presale & On-Sale Info|publisher=Zumic|date=28 June 2017 |access-date=26 May 2018}}</ref> Anne-Marie returned as the opening act, while Jamie Lawson was added, and Beoga was added for Ireland.

On 19 September 2018, Sheeran added more 2019 dates to the tour, performing in stadiums across Europe and the UK, starting in May 2019. Due to high demand, numerous additional dates were added to the tour itinerary.

Sheeran later added even more 2019 dates to the Divide tour, performing in Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina in February 2019. He also announced that he would be returning to Asia in April 2019, performing the long-awaited dates that were scheduled to take place in Fall 2017 but were cancelled and rescheduled due to bone fractures in the arms from a bike accident. The cities that were affected by the cancellation were Taipei, Seoul, Hong Kong and Jakarta. Sheeran will perform three Asia 2019 dates in Singapore, Seoul, and Bangkok. Since Sheeran has been adding so many 2019 dates to his tour lately, it is expected that he will announce dates in Taipei, Jakarta, and Hong Kong, seeing as he will be in the region for the first time since April 2018, when the rescheduled dates for Asia took place, and he has already announced that he will perform in Seoul, a date that was cancelled in late 2017. Sheeran later announced a second date in [[Cape Town]], [[South Africa]] at [[Cape Town Stadium]], scheduled for 28 March 2019. On 28 November, Sheeran added dates in [[Tokyo]], [[Osaka]], and [[Jakarta]]. On 10 January 2019, Sheeran added dates in [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]].

For the last four shows, Sheeran played at Chantry Park in Ipswich in what was advertised as a homecoming set of gigs. For each of the four nights, a different additional support act performed - three were chosen by BBC Music Introducing in Suffolk and one by Hoax, all of which were local undercover artists. The local acts that performed were Bessie Turner, Caswell, Salvador and Piers James.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/support-acts-for-ed-sheeran-ipswich-gigs-revealed-1-6192617|title=Revealed - the Suffolk acts supporting Ed Sheeran at his homecoming gigs|first=Amy|last=Gibbons|website=Ipswich Star}}</ref>

==Commercial performance==
In Ireland, more than 300,000 tickets for seven shows across Cork, Belfast, Galway and Dublin were sold in a single day, making history with Sheeran being the only artist to ever do such feat in Irish territory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.independent.ie/entertainment/music/music-news/ed-sheeran-creates-history-as-record-300000-tickets-sold-the-most-ever-sold-by-an-artist-in-ireland-in-one-day-35908154.html|title=Ed Sheeran 'creates history' as record 300,000 tickets sold - the most ever sold by an artist in Ireland in one day|date=8 July 2017|access-date=9 July 2017}}</ref> Due to the phenomenal demand, extra dates were added in both Cork and Dublin, with three dates for each city in total.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/amp/922901/|title=Extra tickets added for Ed Sheeran's Cork, Dublin dates|date=26 November 2017|access-date=27 November 2017}}</ref> Sellout status occurred once again in Santiago during his first concert on 15 May, prompting to add one more date.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}}

In Oceania, the tour broke the official record for the most tickets sold, at over 1&nbsp;million (previously held by the [[Dire Straits]] [[Brothers in Arms Tour]] of 1985, with around 950,000), as well as most stadium shows by a single artist on one tour (18, formerly held by AC/DC at 14). Sheeran also broke records for the biggest stadium tour of Australia and New Zealand, venue record for highest cumulative attendance on one tour and venue record for highest attendance for a single show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2018/03/01/ed-sheerans-australian-and-new-zealand-tour-just-cracked-1-million-tickets-sold/|title=Ed Sheeran's Australian and New Zealand Tour Just Cracked 1 Million Tickets Sold|date=1 March 2018|access-date=2 March 2018}}</ref> More than 710,000 tickets were sold within a single day of general public sale. In [[Sydney]], a total of 243,513 tickets were sold for three shows at the [[ANZ Stadium]], which rolled out over three successive nights from 15 to 17 March 2018. The attendance per show was 79,726, 81,752 and 82,035, respectively. This set a new record for aggregate attendance at a series of stadium concerts in NSW, smashing the old benchmark of 213,045 set by [[AC/DC]] during their [[Black Ice World Tour]] in 2010.<ref name="Sydney">{{Cite web|url=http://www.anzstadium.com.au/footer/news-and-media/2018/anz-stadium-s-ed-sheeran-concerts-break-all-time-attendance-records-in-sydney/|title=ANZ STADIUM’S ED SHEERAN CONCERTS BREAK ALL-TIME ATTENDANCE RECORDS IN SYDNEY|website=ANZ Stadium|date=3 April 2018|access-date=4 April 2018}}</ref>

According to [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]], Sheeran's tour has grossed $551.8&nbsp;million and sold 6,209,122 tickets across 201 dates reported so far, from 16 March 2017 to 31 October 2018. The tour was the eighth highest-grossing tour of 2017, accumulating $122&nbsp;million and selling 1,408,681 tickets.<ref>{{cite web| title=Year End Worldwide 2017 Ticket Sales Top 100 Tours| publisher=Pollstar|url=https://www.pollstar.com/Chart/2018/01/2017YearEndWorldwideTicketSalesTop100Tours_626.pdf|date=5 January 2018| access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref> The Divide Tour became 2018's highest-grossing tour with $429&nbsp;million, setting all-time records for the highest-grossing solo tour and highest year-end gross ever.<ref>{{cite web| title=The Year in Touring Charts: Ed Sheeran Claims 2018's Top Tour; Taylor Swift, Beyoncé & Jay-Z Do Big Business| first=Frankenberg |last=Eric| publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2018/8488851/touring-charts-year-ed-sheeran-tops-taylor-swift-beyonce|date=5 December 2018| access-date=9 December 2018}}</ref>  It then broke the all-time highest-grossing record of $735m for any tour set by the [[U2 360° Tour]] before it finished, despite playing mostly in smaller venues and deliberately keeping the ticket price relatively low with no VIP areas. This is due to the larger number of shows (255) in the tour, and it also became the most attended tour of all time with over 8.5&nbsp;million having attended in 43 countries with further dates to play.<ref name=record>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/02/ed-sheeran-breaks-u2-record-for-highest-grossing-tour-ever |title=Ed Sheeran breaks U2's record for highest-grossing tour ever |first=Ben |last=Beaumont-Thomas|date= 2 August 2019 |work=The Guardian }}</ref>
