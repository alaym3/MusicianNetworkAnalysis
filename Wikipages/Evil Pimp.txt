=== Production work ===
Rhodes has worked with an array of acts that span within the underground rap scene and has helped produce many albums for various artists.  He uses a variety of production equipment to compose hip hop beats. He primarily uses an Akai MPC 4000, Pro Tools, Logic Pro, Roland TR-808 and electronic keyboards manufactured by Korg, Roland and Yamaha.

Evil Pimp cites Academy Award-winning hip hop group [[Three 6 Mafia]] as his signature music production inspirations with other musical influences ranging from DJ Zirk to DJ Squeeky.
