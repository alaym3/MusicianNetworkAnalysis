'''Dark Polo Gang''' is an Italian [[Trap music|trap]] [[musical group]] from [[Rome]] founded by Tony Effe, Dark Side, Wayne Santana and Dark Pyrex in 2014.

Dark Polo Gang is known to have emerged to fame without the help or support of a ''[[Record label|major]]'', having produced music tracks and video clips independently. They rely on an emerging [[independent record label]] called ''Triplosette Entertainment'', of which all contributors are none other than the members of the Gang, longtime friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/it/article/a3e5ee/guarda-la-nuova-scuola-roma-dark|title=Guarda La Nuova Scuola: Roma Dark|date=2017-08-07|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it}}</ref>

Most of their publications were produced by the [[Italian Americans|Italian American]] [[beatmaker]] Sick Luke, considered the fourth member of the group.

== History of the group ==
The four initial members of the group, Arturo Bruni (Dark Side), Nicolò Rapisarda (Tony Effe), Dylan Thomas Cerulli (Dark Pyrex or Principe Pyrex) and Umberto Violo (Dark Wayne or Wayne Santana),<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.brockfordpost.it/i-piskelletti-della-dark-polo-gang/|title=I piskelletti della Dark Polo Gang {{!}} The Brockford Post|date=2017-04-03|work=The Brockford Post|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it-IT}}</ref> have known each other since childhood growing up in the affluent neighborhoods of [[Rome]] ([[Monti (rione of Rome)|Rione Monti]], [[Trastevere]], [[Campo de' Fiori|Campo de 'Fiori]]).<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://noisey.vice.com/it/article/6exkjp/dark-polo-gang-cosa-sono|title=Che cos'è la Dark Polo Gang?|date=2016-01-20|work=Noisey|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it}}</ref> During adolescence they start [[rapping]] for fun until Sick Luke, the son of [[Duke Montana]], convinced them to produce some songs seriously.<ref name=":0" /> On 22 May 2018, the father of Arturo Bruni (Dark Side) announced the withdrawal from the group of the latter and the beginning of his solo career.

In 2015 the first mixtape called ''Full Metal Dark'' was released, available for free download, followed by three individual albums: ''Crack musica'' by Tony and Side, Wayne's ''Succo di zenzero'' and Pyrex's ''The Dark Album''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockit.it/darkpologang/discografia|title=Dark Polo Gang – Discografia – Album – Compilation – Canzoni e brani|website=Rockit.it|language=it-IT|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref>

In 2017 the album ''Twins'' was released, which debuted at the top of the [[Federazione Industria Musicale Italiana|FIMI]] Album Ranking.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/topnews/2017/06/30/in-vetta-hit-parade-dark-polo-gang_21ee37d7-58f7-48c1-ae4b-974332ab7652.html|title=In vetta hit parade Dark Polo Gang – Ultima Ora|date=2017-06-30|work=ANSA.it|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it}}</ref> In August 2017 the single ''Caramelle'' was certified platinum by FIMI, while ''Cono Gelato'' and ''Sportswear'' were certified gold records by the same body.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fimi.it/certificazioni#/category:tutte/year:0/page:0/term:Dark_Polo_Gang|title=FIMI – Certificazioni – FIMI|website=www.fimi.it|language=it|access-date=2018-06-25}}</ref>

In 2018 the DarkSide's mixtape came out, entirely produced by Sick Luke, called ''Sick Side''.

The first album without Dark side was released 28 September 2018, and it's called ''[[Trap Lovers]],'' and it is produced by Sick Luke, Chris Nolan and [[Michele Canova|Michele Canova lorfida]] .

== Issues ==
Under a veiled self-irony, the core of the texts sung by the group consists of a critique of modern rap, now known to everyone. The Gang, moreover, deals with globalization and the need to adapt to its rules to become rich and famous, which has always been the sole objective of the Gang itself. Drugs, the underworld, the passion for fashion, money and love are among the issues mainly dealt with by the group. Using a ''flow'' based on [[assonance]], it is usual to use terms belonging to juvenile slang and typical trap sounds, various references to the cult characters of real life and neologisms belonging to the "alien" world of which they belong and which define themselves as such.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://roma.corriere.it/notizie/cultura_e_spettacoli/16_novembre_03/i-pischelli-dark-rap-8f5dda40-a12d-11e6-9f94-044d5c37e157.shtml|title=I pischelli del rap, la "rivoluzione" Dark Polo Gang|last=Martellini|first=Laura|work=Corriere della Sera|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rockit.it/articolo/dark-polo-gang-dark-album|title=Capire la Dark Polo Gang|work=Rockit.it|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

== Disputes ==
Despite the growing and now achieved success, the Dark Polo Gang is also very criticized and mocked on the web by most of the Italian [[hip hop]] supporters. The main causes of this are the lack of content, the 'disconnected' phrases, apparently meaningless, and the attached non-closed rhymes that often appear in their texts. Distinguished by a constant arrogance and borderline attitudes, the use of scenarios and themes that, according to some, "do not belong" to what is really the origin of the Roman collective, is also strongly a source of criticism.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hotmc.com/per-favore-smettiamo-tutti-in-coro-di-parlare-della-dark-polo-gang/|title=Per favore, smettiamo tutti in coro di parlare della Dark Polo Gang|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it-IT}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.gqitalia.it/show/musica/2017/06/23/finalmente-sono-uscito-dal-tunnel-della-dark-polo-gang/|title=Finalmente sono uscito dal tunnel della Dark Polo Gang|date=2017-06-23|work=GQ Italia|access-date=2018-06-25|language=it-IT}}</ref>
