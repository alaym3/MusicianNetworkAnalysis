The '''First of October Anti-Fascist Resistance Groups''' ({{lang-es|Grupos de Resistencia Antifascista Primero de Octubre, GRAPO}}) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] clandestine [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] group aiming for the formation of a Spanish  [[Republicanism|Republican]] state.

Besides its [[anti-capitalism]], it is [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]], being strongly opposed to [[government of Spain|Spain]]'s [[NATO]] membership.<ref>Alessandro Seregni, ''El Anti-Americanismo Español''</ref>

GRAPO's last attack was in 2006. After having been fairly active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, a dwindling number of its militants along with police actions allowed Spanish officials to claim a number of times to have disbanded the GRAPO after the remaining militants were captured.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2007/06/06/espana/1181150787.html|title=La Guardia Civil desarticula en Cataluña el último comando operativo de los GRAPO|author=Mundinteractivos|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> According to the Spanish police, GRAPO was disbanded after six of its militants were arrested in June 2007<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Desarticulado/ultimo/comando/operativo/GRAPO/detencion/personas/Barcelona/elpepuesp/20070606elpepunac_16/Tes|title=Desarticulado el último 'comando' operativo de los GRAPO con la detención de seis personas en Barcelona|first=Ediciones El|last=País|date=6 June 2007|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref> but formally, the group has not announced its dissolution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.20minutos.es/noticia/129366/0/grapo/mata/banda/About|title=¿Pero los Grapo no habían desaparecido?|author=20Minutos|work=20minutos.es - Últimas Noticias|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref>

GRAPO is included in the [[European Union]]'s list of [[terrorist organisation]]s.<ref>''[http://www.guardiacivil.org/terrorismo/grupos/lista.jsp Posición Común 2004/309/PESC del Consejo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213122701/http://www.guardiacivil.org/terrorismo/grupos/lista.jsp |date=2006-02-13 }}, de 2 de abril de 2004, por la que se actualiza la Posición Común 2001/931/PESC sobre la aplicación de medidas específicas de lucha contra el terrorismo y se deroga la Posición Común 2003/906/PESC.- Diario Oficial n° L 099 de 03/04/2004 p. 0061 - 0064.''</ref>

==History==
GRAPO has its origins in the [[Organisation of Marxist–Leninists of Spain]] (OMLE), which dissolved itself in its first congress in 1975. At the beginning of 1976, two months after General [[Francisco Franco]]'s death, during the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] from dictatorship, the [[Communist Party of Spain (Reconstituted)]] (PCE-r) began a struggle against the political reforms. The PCE(r) restructured itself into different commissions; one of these was a "front against fascism", founded by Juan Carlos Delgado de Codex, which became the GRAPO.<ref name="ReferenceA">Junta de Castilla y Leon. ''El FRAP y el GRAPO en España''</ref>

This newly-born movement was named after the killing of four Spanish policemen on 1 October 1975, the first violent action of the PCE(r). The "Antifascist Resistance Groups October First" (GRAPO) took this date as a starting point as a [[terrorist organization]]. Only five months later, after five workers were killed by the [[Spanish police]] during [[demonstration (political)|demonstrations]] in [[Vitoria-Gasteiz]], the PCE(r) told its sympathizers to take up arms and create the nucleus of a future Spanish "[[Red Army]]" which would be directed by a central command. A number of [[explosive device]]s were detonated in different locations in Spain on 18 July 1976, and GRAPO claimed responsibility for the coordinated explosions in the press, becoming well-known overnight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/05/31/espana/1117527674.html|title=Los GRAPO, terroristas germinados en los años 60 - españa - elmundo.es|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref>

After the high-profile [[kidnapping]] of wealthy politician [[Antonio María Oriol Urquijo|Antonio María de Oriol y Urquijo]] in 1976 and General Villaescusa in 1977 as well as the killing of more Spanish policemen, GRAPO became established as an [[urban guerrilla]] group, in a similar manner as [[Revolutionary Antifascist Patriotic Front]] (FRAP) had been in [[Francoist Spain]].

GRAPO increased its activity from 1979 onwards, including the [[May 1979 Madrid bombing|bombing of a café]] in [[Madrid]] on 26 May 1979, which killed nine people. However, the group's level of support waned during the 1980s. The transitional democratic regime was not destabilized as the group had promised.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
 
In 1984, the Spanish authorities issued an anti-terrorist law inspired by the Italian model which facilitated police operations against GRAPO, and many arrests followed. GRAPO reacted by simplifying its structure while "waiting for better times". It continued its clandestine activities at a lower level by means of mobile militants, which easily formed and easily split up, becoming difficult to detect.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/ESPAnA/CONSTITUCIoN_ESPAnOLA_DE_1978/LEY_ANTITERRORISTA/ley/antiterrorista/estado/excepcion/encubierto/elpepiesp/19850422elpepinac_10/Tes/|title=La ley antiterrorista, un estado de excepción encubierto|author=Ediciones El País|work=EL PAÍS|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref>

Police work caused serious blows to GRAPO's structure. Currently the group is inactive yet not formally self-dissolved.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.edu/library/Research/SubjectGuides/SpecialTopics/TerroristProfile/Prior/GRAPO.html|title=Dudley Knox Library - Naval Postgraduate School|access-date=26 November 2016}}</ref>

== Summary of GRAPO's activity ==
Since its inception in 1975 until its last-known activity in 2006, it killed 84 people, including police, [[Spanish Armed Forces|military]] personnel, judges, and [[civilian]]s via bombings and shootings. A number of its militants were killed during [[bank robberies]] committed to raise funds for the organization. The group has also committed a number of kidnappings, initially for political reasons and later on for [[ransom]]. Its last attack was in 2006, when GRAPO shot dead Ana Isabel Herrero, the owner of a temporary [[work agency]] in [[Zaragoza]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.libertaddigital.com:6681/noticias/noticia_1276307643.html|title=Libertad Digital: El último grupo de los GRAPO tenía previsto volver a atentar|access-date=11 February 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226121106/http://www.libertaddigital.com:6681/noticias/noticia_1276307643.html|archive-date=26 December 2011}}</ref>

In 2000, GRAPO's leader Manuel Pérez 'Arenas' was [[sentence (law)|sentenced]] in a French court for [[criminal conspiracy]] with terrorist intent.{{cn|date=April 2021}} Spain issued a request for his immediate [[extradition]].{{cn|date=April 2021}} To date GRAPO has not named a successor.{{cn|date=April 2021}}

==Notable members==
Spanish [[Paralympian]] [[Sebastián Rodríguez (swimmer)|Sebastián Rodríguez]] was a member of GRAPO .<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/disability-sport/19529780|title=Spanish swimmer Sebastian Rodriguez triumphs over dark past|date=8 September 2012|author=Rosario Gabino|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

==Supporters==
In October 2011, Spanish [[hip hop]] artist [[Pablo Hasel]] was arrested for condoning terrorism after he saluted one of GRAPO's imprisoned members in a [[music video]]. He was soon released from jail, but the charges were not dropped.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rapper Pablo Hasel arrested for apology of terrorism|work=Firat News Agency|date=5 October 2011|access-date=2 July 2018|url=https://anfenglish.com/news/rapper-pablo-hasel-arrested-for-apology-of-terrorism-4204}}</ref> Ten years later on 16 February 2021, Hasel was arrested and imprisoned again on similar charges by the [[social democrat]] [[PSOE]]-UP government, leading to [[anti-fascist]] groups staging mass demonstrations across the country demanding the release of Hasel and all political prisoners, including members of PCE(r) and GRAPO.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

In February 2014, a [[Twitter]] user was convicted of glorifying terrorism for tweets praising GRAPO.<ref>{{cite news|title=One-year prison sentence for 21-year-old Twitter user who glorified terrorists|work=[[El País]]|date=4 February 2014|access-date=4 February 2014|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/04/inenglish/1391513715_931671.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=In a First for Spain, a Woman Is Convicted of Inciting Terror over Twitter|first=Raphael|last=Minder|date=22 February 2014|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/world/europe/in-a-first-for-spain-a-woman-is-convicted-of-inciting-terror-over-twitter.html}}</ref>
