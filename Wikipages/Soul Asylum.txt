'''Soul Asylum''' is an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1981 in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota. Their 1993 hit "[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]" won the [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]].

The band was originally called '''Loud Fast Rules''', with a lineup consisting of [[Dave Pirner]], [[Dan Murphy (musician)|Dan Murphy]], [[Karl Mueller (rock musician)|Karl Mueller]], and Pat Morley.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|title=The Great Rock Discography|last=Strong|first=Martin C.|publisher=Mojo Books|year=2000|isbn=1-84195-017-3|edition=5th|location=Edinburgh|pages=906–907}}</ref> They changed their name to Soul Asylum in 1983.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5478|pure_url=yes}} |title=Soul Asylum |access-date=June 20, 2007 |author=Sullivan, Denise |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Morley was replaced by [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] in 1984. The band recorded three albums with [[Twin/Tone Records]] and two with [[A&M Records]], with little commercial success. In 1992, they released the triple-platinum album ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', featuring  "Runaway Train". The band played at the inauguration of President [[Bill Clinton]] early the next year. They also scored a platinum record with the album ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'' three years later.

In 1998 they recorded ''[[Candy from a Stranger]].'' Mueller was diagnosed with cancer in 2004, and the band organized a benefit concert on his behalf. Mueller died a year later.

The band released four more albums over the next 15 years. Their most recent was ''Hurry Up and Wait'' in 2020, their twelfth studio release.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Luken |first1=Jeremy |title=Soul Asylum Retain Their Gritty Sonic Charm On 'Hurry Up and Wait' |url=https://glidemagazine.com/242520/soul-asylum-retain-their-gritty-sonic-charm-on-hurry-up-and-wait-album-review/ |publisher=Glide Magazine |access-date=20 April 2020 |date=14 April 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years===
The group was an outgrowth of a previous band, Loud Fast Rules, formed in 1981 by drummer and lead vocalist Dave Pirner, guitarist and backing vocalist Dan Murphy, and bassist Karl Mueller. Pirner was moved to rhythm guitar, and Pat Morley took over on drums. 
As Loud Fast Rules, two of their songs were released on the 1982 [[Reflex Records]] cassette compilation ''Barefoot and Pregnant''.<ref>{{Citation

Soul Asylum began performing around the [[Minneapolis–St. Paul]] area (including the nightclub [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]]) and quickly developed a core following while becoming known for their powerful, dynamic stage shows.<ref>[http://first-avenue.com/event/1579/soul-asylum ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617104633/http://first-avenue.com/event/1579/soul-asylum |date=June 17, 2012 }}</ref>

Their 1984 debut album, ''Say What You Will... Everything Can Happen'' was originally released on LP and cassette by local record label [[Twin/Tone]] as a nine-song EP. It is out of print but was re-released on CD as ''[[Say What You Will, Clarence...Karl Sold the Truck]]'', which includes five additional tracks that were cut from the original album. Between the release of ''Say What You Will'' and their second album, [[Grant Young (musician)|Grant Young]] joined the group, taking over the drums from Morley.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> In 1986, Soul Asylum released three albums, ''[[Made to Be Broken]]'', ''[[Time's Incinerator]]'' (on cassette only) and ''[[While You Were Out (album)|While You Were Out]]''.

The band toured relentlessly in its early years, opening for other American touring bands and later performing as a headliner act after gaining exposure on the "[[Flip Your Wig]]" tour with the Minneapolis band [[Hüsker Dü]] in early 1986. Contrasted with some of the popular underground and alternative styles at the time, audiences were struck by the band's onstage swagger, scruffy Midwestern appearance and extremely loud, frenetic sound, mixing tuneful but unrestrained punk, hardcore, 1970s rock, country and self-effacing kitsch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/132soulasylum.htm |title=Soul Asylum : Library |website=Mnhs.Org |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> One early review<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-04-07/entertainment/ca-21904_1_soul-asylum |title=Soul Asylum – Los Angeles Times |website=Articles.latimes.com |date=May 24, 1998 |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> described their sound as "some unholy mix of Kiss and Hank Williams thrown under the wheels of a runaway train." All elements contributed to the band's being described as a "[[grunge]] precursor", a claim often recited in comparisons between pre-Nirvana Minneapolis and Seattle bands. Despite critical acclaim locally and internationally, they remained unknown to a larger U.S. audience and radio market.

===Mainstream popularity and success: 1988–1999===
[[File:DavePirner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dave Pirner at a Soul Asylum concert in Germany in 1990]]
The group signed with [[A&M Records]] in 1988. Their first offering on that label was ''[[Clam Dip & Other Delights]]'' (1989), the title and cover art being a parody of ''[[Whipped Cream & Other Delights]]'', by A&M Records co-founder [[Herb Alpert]]. ''[[Hang Time (album)|Hang Time]]'' was released in 1988, followed by ''[[And the Horse They Rode In On]]'' in 1990 (produced by [[X-pensive Winos]] drummer [[Steve Jordan (musician)|Steve Jordan]]). Because of poor sales and Pirner's hearing problems, the group considered disbanding.

After playing a series of acoustic shows in the early 1990s, they were picked up by [[Columbia Records]]. In 1992 they released ''[[Grave Dancers Union]]'', which became their most popular album.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> On January 20, 1993, the group performed at the first [[inauguration]] of United States President [[Bill Clinton]]. Later that year, the band performed "Sexual Healing" for the AIDS benefit album ''[[No Alternative]]'', produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]]. The band added keyboard player Joey Huffman in the summer of 1993. He toured with the band until joining [[Matchbox Twenty]] in 1998. Huffman played on the albums ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', ''[[After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997]]'', and ''[[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]''. Soul Asylum won the 1994 [[Grammy Award for Best Rock Song]] for "[[Runaway Train (Soul Asylum song)|Runaway Train]]". The music video for that song featured photographs and names of missing children, in the style of a public service announcement. At the end of the video, Pirner appeared and said, "If you've seen one of these kids, or you are one of them, please call this number", and then the telephone number of a missing children's help line was shown. For use outside the U.S., the video was edited to include photos and names of missing children from the area where the video would be shown. The video was instrumental in reuniting several children with their families.<ref name=PW>{{cite web |url=http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |title=Back on track |publisher=Pasadena Weekly |date=July 13, 2006 |access-date=April 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221164621/http://www.pasadenaweekly.com/article.php?id=3638&IssueNum=28 |archive-date=December 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Before their next studio album, drummer Grant Young was fired and was replaced by [[Sterling Campbell]].<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=366}}</ref> Campbell had been credited as providing percussion on ''Grave Dancers Union'' (although he had actually done at least half of the drumming on that album).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sjmc.cla.umn.edu/stupro/resonance/article-1.htm |title=School of Journalism & Mass Communication : University of Minnesota |website=Sjmc.cla.umn.edu |date=April 1, 2014 |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> The next release, ''[[Let Your Dim Light Shine]]'', included the track "[[Misery (Soul Asylum song)|Misery]]", which reached the Top 20, but the album was not as successful as the band's previous one. In 1997 Soul Asylum performed a [[benefit concert]] for [[North Dakota]] students whose prom had been cancelled because of the [[Red River Flood of 1997]].<ref>{{cite magazine | date= May 27, 1997 | title= Soul Asylum Gets Prom Date | magazine= RollingStone.com | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soulasylum/articles/story/5929027/soul_asylum_gets_prom_date | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074937/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soulasylum/articles/story/5929027/soul_asylum_gets_prom_date | url-status= dead | archive-date= October 16, 2007 | access-date= June 16, 2007}}</ref> Some of the songs played during the prom were later released on ''[[After the Flood: Live from the Grand Forks Prom, June 28, 1997]]'' in 2004. The group released ''[[Candy from a Stranger]]'' the following year. The album was unsuccessful, and the band was dropped by Columbia Records. Pirner said, "It's sort of sad to say, but you could see the whole grunge-rock-band thing getting totally over-saturated and people were looking for something new." The band took a step back; Pirner explained, "We needed to reassess how far we've gone and how much further we're going to go and which way we want to go and what we do right and what we do wrong. It was kind of time to take inventory."<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Devenish, Colin | date= December 7, 2001 | title= Soul Asylum Return | magazine= RollingStone.com | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soulasylum/articles/story/5919831/soul_asylum_return | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930235350/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soulasylum/articles/story/5919831/soul_asylum_return | url-status= dead | archive-date= September 30, 2007 | access-date= June 16, 2007}}</ref>

===2000s===
Pirner became friends with the film director [[Kevin Smith]], a longtime Soul Asylum fan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.readexiled.com/whysoul.htm |title=why Soul Asylum rules |website=Readexiled.com |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref> Soul Asylum contributed music to three Kevin Smith films, ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]'', ''[[Clerks II]]'', and 1997's ''[[Chasing Amy]]'' (in which Pirner provided the score). Smith directed the music video for the song "Can't Even Tell," which was featured on the ''Clerks'' soundtrack.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enterthesoulasylum.com/discography/soundtracks/clerks_ii/ |title=Clerks II |website=EnterTheSoulAsylum.com |date=August 22, 2006 |access-date=April 23, 2014}}</ref>

In May 2004, bassist Mueller was diagnosed with [[Esophageal cancer|throat cancer]] and underwent treatment. In October 2004, a benefit concert was held for him in Minneapolis at The Quest nightclub, featuring popular local groups and musicians, including Soul Asylum, the [[Gear Daddies]], [[Paul Westerberg]], and former [[Hüsker Dü]] bandmates [[Bob Mould]] and [[Grant Hart]], who reunited for their first performance together in sixteen years. The benefit raised over $50,000.<ref>{{cite magazine | author=Devenish, Colin | date= October 24, 2004 | title= Husker Du Men Reunite | magazine= RollingStone.com | url= https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soulasylum/articles/story/6585758/husker_du_men_reunite | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071016074942/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/soulasylum/articles/story/6585758/husker_du_men_reunite | url-status= dead | archive-date= October 16, 2007 | access-date= June 17, 2007}}</ref> At the time, Mueller's cancer was in [[remission (medicine)|remission]], and he played with his bandmates during the show. Mueller later recorded his last Soul Asylum album, ''[[The Silver Lining (Soul Asylum album)|The Silver Lining]]''. However, the cancer returned, and he died at his home on June 17, 2005. Soul Asylum released ''The Silver Lining'' on July 11, 2006, their first album of new material since ''[[Candy from a Stranger]]'', released eight years earlier.[[File:Soul Asylum 2.jpg|thumb|right|Soul Asylum in 2010]]
In late 2005, ex-[[The Replacements (band)|Replacements]] bassist (and former [[Guns N' Roses]] bassist) [[Tommy Stinson]] and former [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] drummer [[Michael Bland]] joined Soul Asylum. The band completed its American tour in support of ''The Silver Lining'' in late 2006. In November and December 2006 they opened for [[Cheap Trick]] on that band's American tour. On March 10, 2007, Soul Asylum joined [[Cyndi Lauper]], [[Mint Condition]], and [[Lifehouse (band)|Lifehouse]] in a concert to benefit Wain McFarlane, the leader of the reggae band Ipso Facto, to help pay for the expenses of a kidney transplant.<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/entertainment/16492644.htm]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929111257/http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/entertainment/16492644.htm |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>

=== 2010s ===
Stinson was a permanent member until 2012, but in 2006 and 2007, while he was on tour with Guns N' Roses, his place was temporarily filled by George Scot McKelvey. During the 2010 Guns N' Roses world tour, his fill-in was [[Pete Donnelly (musician)|Pete Donnelly]]. Soul Asylum released the album ''[[Delayed Reaction]]'' in 2012.<ref name="enterthesoulasylum1">{{cite web |url=http://enterthesoulasylum.com/discography/albums/#change_of_fortune |title=Change of Fortune |website=EnterTheSoulAsylum.com |access-date=March 29, 2012}}</ref>

On October 9, 2012, guitarist Dan Murphy retired from Soul Asylum to focus on his private life.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/soul-asylum-co-founder-dan-murphy-leaves-band-20121009|title=Guitarist Dan Murphy Leaves Soul Asylum|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 9, 2012|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref>

In November 2012, Winston Roye replaced Tommy Stinson on bass and Justin Sharbono replaced Dan Murphy on guitar. In 2016, Ryan Smith replaced Sharbono.

=== 2020s ===
The band's twelfth studio album, ''Hurry Up and Wait'', was released on April 17, 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Music Friday: The Top 7 Albums Out On April 17 |url=https://www.npr.org/2020/04/16/836339242/new-music-friday-the-top-7-albums-out-on-april-17 |publisher=NPR |access-date=20 April 2020 |date=17 April 2020}}</ref>

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted the 2020 tour in support of "Hurry Up and Wait" with a final performance at the Teragram Ballroom in Los Angeles on March 11, 2020. Soul Asylum has not publicly performed since with the exception of Pirner and Smith hosting frequent "live" performances during the 2020 shutdown via Facebook and Instagram.

Soul Asylum returned to the stage on June 26th, 2021 performing in New Lenox,  Illinois as the opening act for the Bodeans.
