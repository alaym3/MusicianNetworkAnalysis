'''Roger Kynard''' "'''Roky'''" '''Erickson''' (July 15, 1947&nbsp;– May 31, 2019) was an American musician and singer-songwriter. He was a founding member and the leader of [[the 13th Floor Elevators]] and a pioneer of the [[psychedelic rock]] genre.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dorian Lynskey |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,2097535,00.html |title="The man who went too high".

==Biography==
Erickson was born in [[Dallas, Texas]], to Roger and Evelyn Erickson, and had four younger brothers. The nickname "Roky," a contraction of his first and middle names, was given to him by his parents.<ref name=HeraldObit>{{cite news |last= Cooper|first=Neil |date=June 9, 2019 |title=Obituary: Roky Erickson, singer and pioneer of psychedelic rock |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/opinion/17695060.obituary-roky-erickson-singer-pioneer-psychedelic-rock/ |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=[[Glasgow, Scotland]] |access-date=2020-08-26 }}</ref> His father, an architect and civil engineer, was stern and disapproving of Erickson's countercultural attitudes, once forcibly cutting his son's hair rather than allow him to grow it out [[Beatles]]-style. His mother was an amateur artist and opera singer, and encouraged Erickson's musical talent by taking guitar lessons herself so she could teach him.<ref name=TexasMonthly>{{cite magazine |last=Hall |first=Michael |date=December 2001 |title=A Long, Strange Trip |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-culture/a-long-strange-trip/ |magazine=[[Texas Monthly]] |access-date= 2020-08-31}}</ref>

Erickson was interested in music from his youth, playing piano from age five and taking up guitar at 10. He attended school in Austin and dropped out of [[William B. Travis High School (Austin, Texas)|Travis High School]] in 1965, one month before graduating, rather than cut his hair to conform to the school dress code.<ref name="autogenerated1">"The fall and rise of Roky Erickson. ''Austin American-Statesman'', July 12, 2007. p 13 (Xlent section).</ref> 
Erickson wrote his first songs, "[[You're Gonna Miss Me (song)|You're Gonna Miss Me]]" and "We Sell Soul", at age 15, and started a band with neighborhood friends which would evolve into his first notable group, the Spades.<ref name=Exclaim>{{cite news |last=Schneider |first=Jason |date=April 25, 2010 |title=Roky Erickson: Back On Earth |url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/roky_erickson-back_on_earth |work=[[Exclaim!]] |location=[[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] |access-date=2020-08-26 }}</ref> The Spades scored a regional hit with "We Sell Soul"; the song is included as an unlisted bonus track on Erickson's 1995 album ''[[All That May Do My Rhyme]]'' and was adapted as "Don't Fall Down" by the 13th Floor Elevators for their debut album. The Spades' original version of "[[You're Gonna Miss Me (song)|You're Gonna Miss Me]]", later a hit for the 13th Floor Elevators, was featured on the compilation album ''The Best of [[Pebbles series|Pebbles]] Volume 1''.

===The 13th Floor Elevators years===
{{main|The 13th Floor Elevators}}
In late 1965, at age 18, Erickson co-founded the 13th Floor Elevators.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2019/05/roky-erickson-dead-at-71/|title=Roky Erickson Dead at 71|last=Burks|first=Tosten|date=31 May 2019|work=Spin|publisher=Billboard-Hollywood Reporter Media Group|access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref> He and bandmate [[Tommy Hall (American musician)|Tommy Hall]] were the main songwriters. Early in her career, singer [[Janis Joplin]] considered joining the Elevators, but Family Dog's [[Chet Helms]] persuaded her to go to San Francisco instead, where she found major fame.

The band released their debut album ''[[The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators]]'' in 1966. It contained the band's only charting single, Erickson's "You're Gonna Miss Me". A stinging breakup song, the single was a major hit on local charts in the U.S. southwest and appeared at lower positions on national singles charts as well. Critic Mark Deming writes that "If Roky Erickson had vanished from the face of the earth after The 13th Floor Elevators released their epochal debut single, "You're Gonna Miss Me", in early 1966, in all likelihood he'd still be regarded as a legend among [[garage rock]] fanatics for his primal vocal wailing and feral harmonica work."<ref>{{cite web|last=Deming |first=Mark |url={{AllMusic|class=album |id=r730748 |pure_url=yes}} |title=I Have Always Been Here Before: The Roky Erickson Anthology – Roky Erickson |publisher=AllMusic |date=March 1, 2005 |access-date=2011-11-02}}</ref>

In 1967, the band followed up with ''[[Easter Everywhere]]'', perhaps the band's most focused effort, featuring "[[Slip Inside This House]]", and a noted cover of [[Bob Dylan]]'s "[[It's All Over Now, Baby Blue]]". The album ''[[Live (13th Floor Elevators album)|Live]]'' was released in 1968 by the band's record label, [[International Artists]], with little to no input from the band. It featured audience applause dubbed over studio recordings of cover versions, alternate takes, and older material.

''[[Bull of the Woods]]'' (1969) was the 13th Floor Elevators' final album on which they worked as a group and was largely the work of Stacy Sutherland. Erickson—due to health and legal problems—and Tommy Hall were only involved with a few tracks, including "Livin' On" and "May the Circle Remain Unbroken".

===Mental illness and legal problems===
In 1968, while performing at [[HemisFair '68|HemisFair]], Erickson began speaking [[gibberish]]. He was soon diagnosed with [[paranoid schizophrenia]] and sent to a [[Houston]] [[psychiatric hospital]], where he involuntarily received [[electroconvulsive therapy]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />

The Elevators were vocal proponents of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and [[psychedelic drug]] use,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/obituary/8514011/roky-erickson-dead-13th-floor-elevators|title=Roky Erickson, Frontman of Psych-Rock Pioneers The 13th Floor Elevators, Dies at 71|last=Eggertsen|first=Chris|date=31 May 2019|work=Billboard|access-date=1 June 2019}}</ref> and were subject to extra attention from law enforcement agencies. In 1969, Erickson was arrested for possession of a single [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] joint in Austin. Facing a potential ten-year incarceration, Erickson pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity to avoid prison. He was first sent to the [[Austin State Hospital]]. After several escapes, he was sent to the Rusk State Hospital in [[Rusk, Texas]], where he was subjected to more [[electroconvulsive therapy]] and [[Chlorpromazine|Thorazine]] treatments, ultimately remaining in custody until 1972. During his time at Rusk, he continued writing songs and poetry. Family and friends managed to smuggle out some of these poems and, in 1972, self published the book ''Openers'', intending to use the proceeds to hire a lawyer. (Various sources claim approximately 1,000 copies of ''Openers'' were printed; how many copies were actually sold remains unknown.) Six tracks from the 1999 Erickson collection ''Never Say Goodbye'' were also recorded during his time at Rusk.

===Alien years===
In 1974, after having been released from the state hospital, Erickson formed a new band which he called "Bleib alien", ''Bleib'' being an anagram of Bible and/or German for "[[wikt:bleiben|remain]]," and "Alien" being a pun on the German word ''[[wikt:allein|allein]]'' ("alone") – the phrase in German, therefore, being "remain alone." His new band exchanged the psychedelic sounds of [[The 13th Floor Elevators]] for a more [[hard rock]] sound that featured lyrics on old [[horror film]] and [[science fiction theme]]s. "[[Two Headed Dog (Red Temple Prayer)]]" (produced by [[The Sir Douglas Quintet]]'s [[Doug Sahm]] and inspired by [[Vladimir Demikhov]]'s 1950s [[head transplant]] experiments) was released as a single.

The new band was renamed Roky Erickson and the Aliens. In 1979, after playing with the Reversible Cords on May Day at Raul's, Erickson recorded 15 new songs with producer [[Stu Cook]], former bass player of [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]]. These efforts were released in two "overlapping" LPs – ''Roky Erickson and the Aliens'' (CBS UK, 1980) and ''[[The Evil One (Roky Erickson album)|The Evil One]]'' (415 Records, 1981). Cook played bass on two tracks, "Sputnik" and "Bloody Hammer". Roky performed with [[The Nervebreakers]] as his backup band at The Palladium in [[Dallas]] in July 1979. A recording was issued on the French label [[New Rose]] and was recently re-issued elsewhere.

The Austin-based band the Explosives served as Roky's most frequent back-up band during the early [[Raul's (night club)|Raul's]] era, between 1978 and the early 1980s. Billed as Roky Erickson and the Explosives, they were regulars at Raul's, the Continental Club, and other Austin venues. It was this incarnation that contributed two live tracks to the first ''Live at Raul's'' LP, released in 1980, with other Raul's top bands: [[The Skunks]], Terminal Mind, The Next, Standing Waves, and The Explosives (without Roky Erickson). The Roky Erickson tracks ("Red Temple Prayer" and "Don't Shake Me Lucifer")  were not included on the initial release for contractual reasons, but were included on a later release.<ref>interview with Fred Krc, June 17, 2015; Club Calendars of Raul's, Continental Club and Soap Creek Saloon, 1978—1982</ref>
In 1982, Erickson asserted that a [[Martian]] had inhabited his body. He came to feel that, due to his being alien, human beings were attacking him psychically. A concerned friend enlisted a Notary Public to witness an official statement by Erickson that he was an alien; he hoped by declaring so publicly he would be in line with any "international laws" he might have been breaking. Erickson claimed the attacks then indeed stopped.

===Creative decline and renewed interest===
Beginning in the 1980s, Erickson developed a years-long obsession with the mail, often spending hours poring over random [[Advertising mail|junk mail]] he received and writing to solicitors and celebrities (dead or living). He was arrested in 1989 on charges of mail theft for gathering up mail from the mailboxes of neighbors who had moved; Erickson collected the mail and taped it to the walls of his bedroom. The charges were dropped when Erickson insisted that he had never opened any of the mail.

In 1984 an observational documentary was produced in Austin for Swedish television, entitled ''Demon Angel: A Day and Night With Roky Erickson''. It featured Erickson in plugged and unplugged performances, solo and with local musician/producer Mike Alvarez on additional guitar, in an underground creek beneath the Congress Street Bridge on Halloween. Alvarez later released the film on VHS,<ref>"[https://www.discogs.com/Roky-Erickson-Demon-Angel-A-Day-And-Night-With-Roky-Erickson/release/12776929 Demon Angel: A Day and Night With Roky Erickson]".

Several live albums of his older material have been released since the mid-1980s, and in 1990 [[Sire Records]]/[[Warner Bros. Records]] released a [[tribute album]], ''[[Where The Pyramid Meets The Eye: A Tribute to Roky Erickson]]'', produced by WB executive [[Bill Bentley (producer)|Bill Bentley]]. It featured versions of Erickson's songs performed by [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[R.E.M.]], [[ZZ Top]], [[Poi Dog Pondering]], [[Julian Cope]], [[Butthole Surfers]], [[Bongwater (band)|Bongwater]], [[John Wesley Harding (singer)|John Wesley Harding]], [[Doug Sahm]], and [[Primal Scream]], among others. According to the liner notes, the title of the album came from a remark Erickson made to a friend who asked him to define psychedelic music, to which Erickson reportedly replied "It's where the pyramid meets the eye, man," an apparent reference to the [[Eye of Providence]] and the [[Great Seal of the United States]].

In 1995, Erickson released ''[[All That May Do My Rhyme]]'' on [[Butthole Surfers]] drummer [[King Coffey]]'s label [[Trance Syndicate]] Records. Produced by [[Texas Tornados]] bassist [[Speedy Sparks]], Austin recording legend [[Stuart Sullivan]], and [[Texas Music Office]] director [[Casey Monahan]], the release coincided with the publication of ''[[Openers II]]'', a complete collection of Erickson's lyrics. Published by [[Henry Rollins]]'s [[2.13.61]] Publications, it was compiled and edited by Monahan with assistance from Rollins and Erickson's youngest brother [[Sumner Erickson]], a classical [[tuba]] player.

Sumner was granted legal custody of Roky in 2001, and established a legal trust to aid his brother. As a result, Roky received some of the most effective medical and legal aid of his life, the latter useful in helping sort out the complicated tangle of contracts that had reduced [[royalties|royalty payments]] to all but nothing for his recorded works. He also started taking medication to better manage his schizophrenia.

A documentary film on the life of Roky Erickson titled ''[[You're Gonna Miss Me]]'' was made by director [[Keven McAlester]] and screened at the 2005 [[SXSW]] film festival. In September of the same year, Erickson performed his first full-length concert in 20 years at the annual [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] with The Explosives with special guest and longtime associate [[Billy Gibbons]] of [[ZZ Top]].

In the December 30, 2005 issue of the ''[[Austin Chronicle]]'', an alternative weekly newspaper in Austin, Texas, [[Margaret Moser]] chronicled Erickson's recovery, saying Erickson had weaned himself off his medication, played at 11 gigs in Austin that year, obtained a driver's license, bought a car (a [[Volvo]]), and voted.

In 2007, Erickson played his first ever gigs in New York City at Southpaw in Brooklyn, NY, as well as California's [[Coachella Festival]] and made a debut performance in England to a capacity audience at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London. Roky continued to play in Europe, performing for the first time in Finland at [[Ruisrock]] festival. According to the article in ''[[Helsingin Sanomat]]'' June 8, 2007, the performance was widely considered the highlight of the festival day.<ref>{{cite web|author=Juha Merimaa |url=http://www.hs.fi/kulttuuri/artikkeli/Ruisrockin+sympaattisin+esitys/1135228575848 |title="Ruisrockin sympaattisin esitys".

On September 8, 2008, Scottish [[post-rock]] band [[Mogwai]] released the ''[[Batcat]]'' EP. Erickson is featured on one of the tracks, "Devil Rides".<ref>{{cite web |last=Dobson |first=Gareth |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/3390989 |title=News – Mogwai release new album and EP.

Erickson returned to the stage in 2008 to perform songs from the 13th Floor Elevators catalog that had not been performed in decades with fellow Austinites [[The Black Angels (band)|The Black Angels]] as his backing band. After months of practices and time recording in an Austin studio, they performed a show in Dallas followed by a West Coast tour. The Black Angels played a regular set and then backed Erickson as his rhythm section, playing 13th Floor Elevators songs as well as songs from Erickson's solo albums.

On April 20, 2010, Erickson released ''[[True Love Cast Out All Evil]]'', his first album of new material in 14 years. [[Okkervil River]] serves as Erickson's backing band on the album.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Freedman |work=Dallas Observer |title=Dallas-born Roky Erickson To Release First Album of New Material in 14 Years.

In March 2012 Erickson toured New Zealand and Australia for the first time headlining [[Golden Plains Festival]] in [[Meredith, Victoria|Meredith]] as well as playing sold-out side shows in Sydney and Melbourne.

On May 10, 2015, he performed with the reunited 13th Floor Elevators at [[Levitation (festival)|Levitation]] (formerly Austin Psych Fest, the event was renamed "Levitation" after the song of the same title). The band consisted of original band members Erickson, Tommy Hall, John Ike Walton, and Ronnie Leatherman, joined by Roky's son Jegar Erickson on harmonica, Roky's lead guitarist Eli Southard, and rhythm guitarist Fred Mitchim.<ref>{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Freedman |work=Dallas Observer |title=Watch a full recording of The 13th Floor Elevators’ first performance in 47 years |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2015/05/watch-a-full-recording-of-the-13th-floor-elevators-first-performance-in-47-years/

Author [[Jonathan Lethem]] titled his 2007 novel ''[[You Don't Love Me Yet]]'' in honor of two (otherwise unconnected) songs of the same title by Erickson and [[The Vulgar Boatmen]]. Lethem called Erickson's song "irresistible" and "one of those incredibly versatile songs."<ref name=AVClub2007>{{cite web |url=https://film.avclub.com/jonathan-lethem-1798211115 |title=Interview: Jonathan Lethem |last=Bahn |first=Christopher |date=2007-04-05 |website=[[The A.V.

''[[The X-Files]]'' episode "[[Jose Chung's From Outer Space|Jose Chung's ''From Outer Space'']]" features a character named "Roky Crikenson", in homage to Erickson. Crikenson, like the original Roky, believes himself to be an alien abductee.

A plotline in an episode of 1990s sitcom ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'' revolved around a sighting of reclusive novelist [[Thomas Pynchon]]. Pynchon himself did not appear, but agreed to allow his name to be used on the condition that it was specifically mentioned that Pynchon was seen wearing a T-shirt showing a picture of Erickson.<ref name=Grantland2013>{{cite web |url=https://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/purple-drank-britney-and-the-rachel-the-weird-but-logical-pop-culture-obsessions-of-thomas-pynchons-bleeding-edge/ |title=Purple Drank, Britney, and The Rachel: The Weird But Logical Pop Culture Obsessions of Thomas Pynchon's Bleeding Edge|last=Pappademas |first=Alex |date=2013-09-25 |website=[[Grantland]] |access-date=2020-09-09}}</ref>  According to the [[Los Angeles Times]], this spurred an increase in sales of Erickson's albums.<ref name=LATimes1994>{{cite news |last=Kipen |first=David |date=1994-05-08 |title=Brevity's Raincheck |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1994-05-08-bk-55045-story.html |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=2020-09-09 }}</ref>

The album ''[[It's Spooky]]'' by [[Daniel Johnston]] and [[Jad Fair]] features the song "I Met Roky Erickson", named after an encounter Johnston had with the artist.

The song "White Faces" was covered by the Dutch occult rock band [[The Devil's Blood]] on their 2008 EP album [[Come Reap]]

The song "[[If You Have Ghosts (song)|If You Have Ghosts]]" was covered by the Swedish heavy metal band [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]] on their EP album ''[[If You Have Ghost]]'', leading to the title track becoming a common catchphrase and meme among Ghost fans.
