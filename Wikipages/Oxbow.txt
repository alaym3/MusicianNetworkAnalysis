An '''oxbow''' is a [[U]]-shaped metal pole (or larger wooden frame) that fits the underside and the sides of the neck of an [[ox]] or [[wikt:bullock|bullock]].  A '''bow pin''' holds it in place.

The term "[[oxbow lake|oxbow]]" is widely used to refer to a U-shaped [[meander]] in a river, sometimes cut off from the modern course of the river that formed it.

[[File:Dietenheim - Futterhaus - Ochsenjoch.jpg|thumb|An ox yoke with wooden bows]]
Its upper ends pass through a purpose-drilled hole through the bar of the [[yoke]] that is held in place into the yoke with a metal screw or key, called a '''bow pin'''. Where wood is used it is most often hardwood steamed into shape, especially [[elm]], [[hickory]] or [[willow]]. A ring, enabling left/right movement controlled from the centre, is attached by a plate to the centre underside of a wooden yoke to enable a pair of bullocks/oxen to be chained to any other pairs in a team and to be hitched to the load behind the animal team.<ref name=roos2>{{cite news |last1=Roosenberg |first1=Richard |title=Britchen, Brakes, Head Yokes for restraining loads behind oxen |url=http://www.tillersinternational.org/oxen/resources_techguides/BritchenBrakesandHeadYokesforRestrainingLoadsBehindOxenTechGuide.pdf |access-date=6 October 2018 |work=TechGuides |publisher=Tillers International |date=1992 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304032749/http://www.tillersinternational.org/oxen/resources_techguides/BritchenBrakesandHeadYokesforRestrainingLoadsBehindOxenTechGuide.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=roos>{{cite news |last1=Roosenberg |first1=Richard |title=Yoking and Harnessing Single Cattle |url=http://www.tillersinternational.org/oxen/resources_techguides/YokingandHarnessingSingleCattleTechGuide.pdf |access-date=6 October 2018 |work=TechGuides |publisher=Tillers International |date=1997 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304031725/http://www.tillersinternational.org/oxen/resources_techguides/YokingandHarnessingSingleCattleTechGuide.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref><ref name=zfu>{{cite web |title=Harnessing Draught Animals |url=http://www.uz.ac.zw/agriculture/cropscience/CD/gff/14%20Draught%20animal%20harnessing.pdf |work=A Guide for Farmers on Good Land Husbandry |publisher=Zimbabwe Farmers Union; Department for Agricultural Technical and Extension Services (Agritex) |access-date=6 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111125081517/http://www.uz.ac.zw/agriculture/cropscience/CD/gff/14%20Draught%20animal%20harnessing.pdf |archive-date=25 November 2011}}</ref>

==Uses of the yoke and oxbows==
{{main|yoke}}
The load is a [[plough]] or any other dragged, non-motorised, field [[agricultural machinery]].<ref name=zfu/>

==Alternative==
Wooden staves can be used instead with a yoke, which is then termed a [[Yoke#Withers yoke|withers yoke]], named after animals with high backs (withers) (e.g. [[zebu cattle]]) which pull mostly on the yoke part of the equipment, not as greatly on the bow shape borne by the stronger front quarters of oxen and bullocks.
