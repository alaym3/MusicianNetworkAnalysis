'''Kim Carnes''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ɑr|n|z}}; born July 20, 1945) is an American singer and songwriter.

Born and raised in [[Los Angeles, California]], she began her career as a songwriter in the 1960s, writing for other artists while performing in local clubs and working as a session background singer with the famed Waters sisters (featured in the documentary ''[[20 Feet from Stardom]]'').

After she signed her first publishing deal with [[Jimmy Bowen]], she released her debut album ''[[Rest on Me]]'' in 1971. Carnes' [[Kim Carnes (album)|self-titled second album]] primarily contained self-penned songs, including her first charting single "You're a Part of Me", which reached No. 35 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart in 1975. In the following year, Carnes released ''[[Sailin']]'', which featured "Love Comes from Unexpected Places". The song won the American Song Festival and the award for Best Composition at the Tokyo Song Festival in 1976.

In her breakthrough year, 1980, Carnes was commissioned by [[Kenny Rogers]] to co-write the songs for his concept album [[Gideon (album)|''Gideon'']] (1980), and their duet "[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]" hit No. 4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and earned the duo a [[Grammy Award]] nomination. Later that year, her cover of [[Smokey Robinson]]'s "[[More Love (Smokey Robinson and the Miracles song)#Kim Carnes version|More Love]]", from the album ''[[Romance Dance]]'' (1980), hit No. 10. The following year, Carnes released ''[[Mistaken Identity (Kim Carnes album)|Mistaken Identity]]'', which featured the worldwide hit, "[[Bette Davis Eyes]]". This became the best-selling single of the year in the United States, spending nine weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], going [[RIAA certification|Gold]], and won the Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. ''Mistaken Identity'' went to No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], was certified [[RIAA certification|Platinum]], and was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]].

Carnes also saw success with the singles "[[Draw of the Cards]]" (No. 28), "[[Does It Make You Remember]]" (No. 36), "[[Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)]]" (No. 15), "[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]" (No. 51), with [[Barbra Streisand]], "[[What About Me? (Kenny Rogers song)|What About Me?]]" (No. 15), with Kenny Rogers and [[James Ingram]], "I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is", from the [[Flashdance (soundtrack)|''Flashdance'' soundtrack]], and the Grammy Award nominated singles "[[Voyeur (Kim Carnes song)|Voyeur]]" (No. 29) and "[[Invisible Hands (song)|Invisible Hands]]" (No. 40). Her other successes as a songwriter include co-writing the No. 1 duet "[[The Heart Won't Lie]]" with [[Donna Weiss]] (who had co-written "Bette Davis Eyes" with [[Jackie DeShannon]]), which was recorded by [[Vince Gill]] and [[Reba McEntire]].

Her distinctive, raspy vocal style has drawn comparisons to [[Rod Stewart]].<ref name="NYTimes">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/26/arts/kim-carnes-lifts-bette-davis-to-the-top.html|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=March 18, 2012|date=July 26, 1981|title=Kim Carnes Lifts 'Bette Davis' To The Top|first=John|last=Rockwell}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/26/arts/kim-carnes-sings-at-savoy.html|title=Kim Carnes Sings At Savoy|access-date=December 30, 2017|date=August 26, 1981|first=Stephen|last=Holden|newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Her most recent studio album is ''[[Chasin' Wild Trains]]'' (2004).

She was raised in Pasadena, California, and graduated from [[San Marino High School]] in 1963.

==Career==

===1962–1974: Early career and first studio album===
Kim Carnes was a songwriter and performer from an early age. After writing songs for many years, Carnes signed her first publishing deal in 1962 with producer [[Jimmy Bowen]].{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} During this period, she shared demo-recording time with Bowen's other writers, including [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], and [[J.D. Souther]]. Carnes also sang "Nobody Knows", written by [[Mike Settle]], which was featured in the end credits of the 1971 film ''[[Vanishing Point (1971 film)|Vanishing Point]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/vanishing-point-original-soundtrack-mw0000167497|title=Vanishing Point [Original Soundtrack]|publisher=[[AllMusic]].

[[All Media Network]]|access-date=  September 7, 2014}}</ref>

Also in 1971, she and [[Mike Settle]] again worked with Bowen to create the [[bubblegum pop]] studio group [[The Sugar Bears]]. The album ''Presenting the Sugar Bears'' and three singles were released with the song "You Are the One", reaching No. 83 on the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://badcatrecords.com/BadCat/SUGARbear.htm|title=Presenting The Sugar Bears at BadCatRecords|access-date=  January 11, 2015}}</ref>

In the early 1970s, Carnes and husband Dave Ellingson co-wrote several songs with [[David Cassidy]], then at the peak of his career as an international idol, and Carnes toured the world with him as an opening act with her husband. Cassidy's albums ''[[Rock Me Baby (album)|Rock Me Baby]]'', ''[[Dreams are Nuthin' More than Wishes (album)|Dreams are Nuthin' More than Wishes]]'' and ''[[Cassidy Live!]]'' include several songs penned by Carnes, along with Ellingson and Cassidy. Carnes also provided backing vocals for these albums.

After signing with Amos Records, her first solo album ''[[Rest on Me]]'', produced by Jimmy Bowen, was released in 1971.

===1975–1979: Early chart successes===
In 1975, Carnes released her self-titled second album, which contained her first charted hit, "You're A Part Of Me", which reached No. 32 on the US Adult Contemporary charts.<ref name="Huey" /> Carnes re-recorded this track with [[Gene Cotton]] three years later. The majority of tracks on this second album were written by Carnes and Ellingson.

Her third album ''[[Sailin']]'' was produced by [[Jerry Wexler]] and released in 1976. One track, "Love Comes from Unexpected Places", won Grand Prize at the 1976 American Song Festival. The song also earned the award for Best Composition at the Tokyo Song Festival. It gained additional notice after it was recorded by [[Barbra Streisand]] on her 1977 album ''[[Superman (Barbra Streisand album)|Superman]]''. Streisand also recorded Carnes's "Stay Away" on her 1978 album ''[[Songbird (Barbra Streisand album)|Songbird]]''. In spite of Streisand's endorsement of her material, Carnes's own Top 40 breakthrough did not occur till 1978 when [[Gene Cotton]] recruited her to record a duet version of "You're a Part of Me", which reached No. 36 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

In 1979, she recorded a single using the pseudonym '''Connie con Carne''' titled "She Dances with Meat", written by herself and Dave Ellingson.<ref>{{YouTube|5BkVY08FmYg|Kim Carnes (as Connie con Carne) – She Dances With Meat}}.

===1980–1981: Collaboration with Kenny Rogers and "Bette Davis Eyes"===
In 1980, her duet with [[Kenny Rogers]] "[[Don't Fall in Love with a Dreamer]]" became a major hit on the Pop (No. 4), Country (No. 3) and Adult Contemporary (No. 2) charts.<ref name="Huey" /> The song was culled from Rogers' [[concept album]] ''[[Gideon (album)|Gideon]]'', written entirely by Carnes and her husband Dave Ellingson. Later that year, her cover version of the [[Smokey Robinson & The Miracles]] song "[[More Love (Smokey Robinson & the Miracles song)|More Love]]" became her first solo top 10 hit (number 10 in the pop charts and number six in the Adult Contemporary charts).<ref name="Huey" /> Robinson was, indeed, so impressed with Carnes's recording and success with the song that he later wrote and composed "[[Being with You (song)|Being with You]]" for her. However, Robinson's then producer [[George Tobin]] insisted instead that he record and release the song himself. "The record that went number one for me is a demo for Kim," Robinson told ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mike-ragogna/friends-rain-plans-love-s_b_5713129.html |title= Friends, Rain Plans, Love Songs & Lullabies: Conversations with Smokey Robinson, Israel Nash & Darryl Tookes |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |first= Mike |last= Ragogna |date=  August 26, 2014 |access-date=September 16, 2014}}</ref> In 1981, Carnes provided backing vocals on [[Dionne Warwick]]'s ''[[No Night So Long]]'' album.<ref>"No Night So Long" CD booklet, personnel section.

In 1981, Carnes recorded the [[Jackie DeShannon]] and Donna Weiss song "[[Bette Davis Eyes]]", originally written and composed in 1974. As the first single released from the album ''[[Mistaken Identity (Kim Carnes album)|Mistaken Identity]]'', it spent nine weeks at number one on the U.S. singles charts and became a worldwide hit. The song's success propelled the album to number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for four weeks. The single became the biggest hit of the entire year for 1981,<ref name="Huey" /> and is second only to [[Olivia Newton-John]]'s "[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John song)|Physical]]" as the biggest hit of the 1980s in the U.S., according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''. The song earned both the [[Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] awards at the [[Grammy Awards of 1982|1982 Grammy Awards]]. Carnes was nominated for Best Pop Female, and ''Mistaken Identity'' also earned a nomination for Album of the Year. Two follow-up singles were released from the album, the title track and "[[Draw of the Cards]]", which also charted in the UK and Australia.

Carnes and her band rehearsed "Bette Davis Eyes" in the studio for three days to take the melody and overall sound of the record to a darker, more haunting place. Keyboard player Bill Cuomo came up with the signature instrumental lick and together with the band and producer Val Garay created a completely new arrangement of the song, recorded the next day with no overdubs.<ref name="ReferenceA">Betts, Stephen L., AOL Music; Kim Carnes interview, Feb. 2010</ref>

[[Bette Davis]] admitted to being a fan of the song and approached Carnes and the songwriters to thank them. Davis wrote to Carnes after the song was released, saying she loved the song. "It was a thrill to become a part of the rock generation," she said in her memoir ''[[This 'N That]]''. Davis's grandson Ashley told the screen legend she had "finally made it". Carnes and Davis struck up a special friendship, with the singer visiting her at her home several times before Davis's death in 1989. In what she considers a career highlight,<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Carnes performed the song live for Davis at a tribute to the legendary actress held just before her death. More recently, the song was used in a 2008 [[Clairol]] Nice 'n Easy TV commercial in the United Kingdom, and the ad featuring the song expanded into South Africa and other territories around the world. In 2008, the song was featured in the opening scene of the documentary film ''[[Valentino: The Last Emperor]]'' and continues to be licensed for film and TV use. In November 2015, the song was the set piece for the back-story of Liz Taylor in the TV anthology ''American Horror Story: Hotel''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/11/04/american-horror-story-hotel-recap-episode-5-room-service/|title='American Horror Story: Hotel' Recap: Episode 5, 'Room Service'|first=Michael|last=Calia|website=Blogs.wsj.com|date=November 5, 2015|access-date=October 15, 2019}}</ref>

===1982–1985: ''Voyeur'' and further releases===
Carnes' later hits included two more singles that just missed the pop top 10: "[[Crazy in the Night (Barking at Airplanes)|Crazy in the Night]]" (from ''Barking at Airplanes'') and "What About Me?" with [[Kenny Rogers]] and [[James Ingram]].

(No. 1), "[[Make No Mistake, He's Mine]]" with [[Barbra Streisand]] (No. 8) (co-produced by Carnes with Bill Cuomo) and "Crazy in Love" (No. 10).

Carnes was nominated for additional Grammy Awards – including Best Rock Vocal Performance Female for ''[[Voyeur (Kim Carnes album)|Voyeur]]'', in 1983 and Best Rock Vocal Performance Female for "Invisible Hands" in 1984. In 1983, Carne's song "I'll Be Here Where the Heart Is" was included on the ''Flashdance'' soundtrack which received a Grammy for Best Album of Original Score Written for a Motion Picture.
