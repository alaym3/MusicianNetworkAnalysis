Lake's ballads, the least typical aspect of ELP's music, often garnered the band their greatest airplay and widest public exposure.</ref>

The band came to prominence following their performance at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] in August 1970. In their first year, the group signed with [[E.G. Records]] (who distributed the band's records through [[Island Records]] in the United Kingdom, and [[Atlantic Records]] in North America), and released ''[[Emerson, Lake & Palmer (album)|Emerson, Lake & Palmer]]'' (1970) and ''[[Tarkus]]'' (1971), both of which reached the UK top five. The band's success continued with ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)|Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' (1971), ''[[Trilogy (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)|Trilogy]]'' (1972), and ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'' (1973, released on ELP's own [[Manticore Records]] label). After a three-year break, Emerson, Lake & Palmer released ''[[Works Volume 1]]'' (1977) and ''[[Works Volume 2]]'' (1977). After ''[[Love Beach]]'' (1978), the group disbanded in 1979.

The band reformed partially in the 1980s as [[Emerson, Lake & Powell]] featuring [[Cozy Powell]] in place of Palmer. [[Robert Berry]] then replaced Lake while Palmer returned, forming [[3 (1980s band)|3]]. In 1991, the original trio reformed and released two more albums, ''[[Black Moon (album)|Black Moon]]'' (1992) and ''[[In the Hot Seat]]'' (1994), and toured at various times between 1992 and 1998. Their final performance took place in 2010 at the [[High Voltage Festival]] in London to commemorate the band's 40th anniversary. Both Emerson and Lake died in 2016,<ref name=keithemersondeath>{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2016/03/11/keith-emerson-death-suicide/|title=Keith Emerson's Death -- Gunshot to the Head ...

==History==

===Formation and first gigs===
The band originated in late 1969, when [[The Nice]] keyboardist [[Keith Emerson]] and [[King Crimson]] bassist and vocalist [[Greg Lake]] met when both groups were on tour. Emerson was looking to form a new band and Lake wished to leave King Crimson,<ref name="h2g2">{{cite web|url=http://h2g2.com/dna/h2g2/alabaster/A2982602|title=Emerson, Lake & Palmer – the Band|publisher=h2g2.com|access-date=7 February 2012}}</ref> and after initial discussions about the possibility of forming a group in New York City, the pair met two months later in December 1969 when The Nice and King Crimson were billed together for concerts at the [[Fillmore West]] in [[San Francisco]]. During a [[soundcheck]] before one of the shows, Emerson described the first time he and Lake played together: "Greg was moving a bass line and I played the piano in back and Zap! It was there."<ref name="classicrockarchive">{{cite web|url=http://archive.classicrockmagazine.com/view/may_2002/55/welcome-back-my-friends |title=Welcome back my friends|page=55|work=Classic Rock Magazine|date=May 2002|access-date=16 February 2012 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> When the Nice split in March 1970 and Lake left King Crimson a month later, the pair began the search for a drummer, which turned out to be a difficult process.<ref name=NME70>{{cite magazine|title=Emerson, Lake and Palmer – the group most likely to|first=Nick|last=Logan|magazine=New Musical Express|date=13 June 1970}}</ref> They initially approached [[Mitch Mitchell]], who was at a loose end following the break-up of [[The Jimi Hendrix Experience]] and suggested a jam session take place amongst the three of them and guitarist [[Jimi Hendrix]]. The session never happened, but it caused the press to report rumours of a planned [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] named HELP, an acronym for "Hendrix Emerson Lake Palmer", which Lake later debunked.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2012/05/greg_lake_elp_jimi_hendrix_prog_rock.php?page=2|title=Greg Lake Is Not a Fan of 'Progressive Rock'|last=Woodbury|first=Jason P.|date=10 May 2012|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|access-date=9 October 2013}}</ref>

[[File:1970-Isle of Wight Festival- 5.JPG|thumb|right|The group's second gig was at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival]]

After rehearsals at [[Island Studios]] in [[Notting Hill]],<ref name=melodymaker1970/> the band formed a live set featuring "[[The Barbarian (song)|The Barbarian]]", an arrangement of the piano piece ''[[Allegro barbaro (Bartók)|Allegro barbaro]]'' by [[Béla Bartók]], "Rondo", an arrangement of the [[jazz standard]] "[[Blue Rondo à la Turk]]" by [[Dave Brubeck]] that Emerson had recorded with the Nice, an arrangement of "[[Nut Rocker]]" as an encore,<ref name=Wight1970>{{cite AV media notes|title=Live at the Isle of Wight 1970|publisher=Manticore Records|date=1997|id=M-CD-101}}</ref> and a rock adaptation of ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition]]'' by [[Modest Mussorgsky]] that Emerson wished to do after seeing it performed with an orchestra at the [[Royal Festival Hall]] in London when he was in the Nice.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=175}} The group wished to enhance their live act, and spent £9,000 on a sound mixer and £4,000 on a [[Moog modular synthesizer]] imported from America that was adapted for better performance on stage.<ref name=NME70/>

The trio's first live gig followed at [[Plymouth]] Guildhall on 23 August 1970, supported by local band Earth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fetherston.tripod.com/tours.html|title=ELP Tour Details 1970–78|publisher=fetherston.tripod.com|access-date=7 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~rm2t-smt/html/elp-tour.htm#anchor72336|title=Tour Date List|publisher=asahi-net.or.jp|access-date=7 February 2012}}</ref>{{sfn|Van der Kiste|2012|p=248}} They travelled to the venue in a transit van previously owned by fellow [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and were paid around £400 for the gig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.plymouthherald.co.uk/ex-elp-drummer-carl-recalls-debut-guildhall/story-16000108-detail/story.html|title=Ex-ELP drummer Carl recalls debut show at Guildhall|date=4 May 2012|work=Plymouth Herald|access-date=18 December 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentnews.co.uk/entertainment/carl_palmer_lord_of_the_drums_1_1383516|title=Carl Palmer - Lord of the drums|publisher=Kent News|first=Nick|last=Ames|date=21 May 2012|access-date=18 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152654/http://www.kentnews.co.uk/entertainment/carl_palmer_lord_of_the_drums_1_1383516|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> A small venue outside London was deliberately chosen in case the concert was a failure, but the concert was well received.<ref name=unknown1971>{{cite journal|url=http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v248/texasrose455/LOTL/marksykes/ELP_028.jpg|title=Emerson, Lake & Palmer|date=c. 1971|first=Penny|last=Valentine|journal=Unknown|access-date=18 December 2016}}</ref> Their second gig took place on 29 August with a set at the [[Isle of Wight Festival 1970|Isle of Wight Festival]] which was attended by an estimated 600,000 people and drew considerable attention from the public and music press. At the end of "Pictures at an Exhibition", the band fired two cannons that Emerson had tested in a field near [[Heathrow Airport]].<ref name=Wight1970/>

The success of the group's debut, as well as Lake's prior association with King Crimson, led to ELP's signing management and recording contracts with [[E.G. Records]], who distributed their records through [[Island Records]] in the UK and [[Atlantic Records]]' [[Cotillion Records]] subsidiary in North America.<ref name=goldmine1996/> Emerson believed that Atlantic's chief [[Ahmet Ertegun]] agreed to take the band on "because we could sell out 20,000-seaters before we even had a record out. That was enough for him to think that a lot of people would go out and buy the record when it did come out."<ref name="classicrockarchive" />

===1970–1971: Debut album, ''Tarkus'', and ''Pictures at an Exhibition''===
[[File:Emerson Lake and Palmer two.jpg|thumb|right|Emerson performing in 1977]]
In the months surrounding their debut gigs, the band recorded their first album, ''[[Emerson, Lake & Palmer (album)|Emerson Lake & Palmer]]'', at [[Advision Studios]]. Lake took on the role of producer, which he had also done in King Crimson, with [[Eddy Offord]] as their engineer. The album included studio versions of "The Barbarian" and "Take a Pebble", "[[Knife-Edge (Emerson, Lake & Palmer song)|Knife-Edge]]", based on the first movement of ''[[Sinfonietta (Janáček)|Sinfonietta]]'' by [[Leoš Janáček]] and the [[Allemande]] of [[French Suites (Bach)#Structure|French Suite No. 1 in D minor]] by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], Palmer's drum solo "[[Tank (song)|Tank]]", the three-part "The Three Fates", and "[[Lucky Man (Emerson, Lake & Palmer song)|Lucky Man]]", an acoustic ballad that Lake wrote when he was twelve.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/t1538224|title=AllMusic Review of Lucky Man|website=AllMusic|access-date=15 February 2012}}</ref> The album was released in the UK in November 1970, and reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 18 in the US.

From September 1970 to March 1971, the band completed their first concert tour with shows across the UK, Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. Their performance on 9 December 1970 at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in London was filmed and released in UK theatres in 1972 with added psychedelic effects including characters from [[Marvel Comics]].{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=137}}

During a break in their first tour in January 1971, Emerson, Lake & Palmer returned to Advision Studios with Offord to record their second album, ''[[Tarkus]]''. Friction between Emerson and Lake during the early recording sessions almost caused the group to disband as Lake disliked the material that Emerson was writing. Following a meeting with the band and management, Lake agreed to write his own songs and continue recording.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=143}} The album was recorded in six days.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ladiesofthelake.com/cabinet/disc71.html|title=ELP, they're all absolutely shattered!|date=10 July 1971|first=Roy|last=Shipston|journal=Disc and Music Echo|access-date=18 December 2016}}</ref> The album's first side is occupied by the 20-minute [[Tarkus (song)|title track]], a seven-part song based on reverse evolution that was recorded in four days. Its [[cover art]] was designed by painter and graphic designer [[William Neal]]. ''Tarkus'' was released in June 1971 on [[Island Records]]. It was a commercial success after it reached No. 1 in the UK and No. 9 in the US. The band resumed touring with their first North American tour, starting 24 April 1971 at [[Thiel College]] in [[Greenville, Pennsylvania]]{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=170}} and continued until the end of May. Further dates across Europe followed until the end of the year.

Emerson, Lake & Palmer released their third album, ''[[Pictures at an Exhibition (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)|Pictures at an Exhibition]]'', in the UK in November 1971. They recorded their performance of it at [[Newcastle City Hall]] on 26 March 1971 and decided to release it with the concert's encore, "Nut Rocker".{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=137}} The group wished to release it as their second album, but Atlantic Records declined to as it is a classical-oriented piece and claimed it would not sell or receive any radio airplay, and offered to release it through [[Nonesuch Records]] which handled more budget, classical, and avant-garde albums.<ref name=goldmine1996/> The band refused, and delayed its release on purpose until after ''Tarkus''; Emerson said the delay was to also show to the press and public that they could write their own songs and were not merely a "band that did classical music".<ref name=beetle1974>{{cite web|url=http://ladiesofthelake.com/cabinet/beetle.html|title=Lucky Men|first=Robert|last=Bowman|magazine=Beetle|date=1974|access-date=20 December 2016}}</ref> Following Island Records' decision to import 250,000 copies into the US which sold within a short amount of time, helped by radio DJ [[Scott Muni]] playing the entire album uninterrupted on [[WNEW-FM|WNEW]] in New York City, Atlantic decided to release it through Cotillion as a budget album in January 1972.<ref name=goldmine1996/> The album peaked at No. 3 in the UK and No. 10 in the US.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=173}}

===1971–1974: ''Trilogy'', ''Brain Salad Surgery'', and touring===
''[[Trilogy (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)|Trilogy]]'', the band's third studio album, was recorded at Advision Studios with Offord between October 1971 and January 1972.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=199}} Its cover art was designed by [[Storm Thorgerson]] and [[Aubrey Powell (designer)|Aubrey Powell]] of [[Hipgnosis]].{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=200}} "Hoedown" is an adaptation of ''Rodeo'' by [[Aaron Copland]].

This was followed by their first dates in Japan in July.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=237}}

In early 1973, the band formed their own record label, [[Manticore Records]], and purchased an abandoned cinema as their own rehearsal hall in [[Fulham]], London.

In June 1973, Emerson, Lake & Palmer began recording ''[[Brain Salad Surgery]]'' in London at Advision and [[Olympic Studios]] which lasted until September that year. Offord was not present for the recording sessions as he was working with [[Yes (band)|Yes]], leaving engineering and mixing duties to [[Chris Kimsey]] and Geoff Young. Lake wrote the album's lyrics with [[Peter Sinfield]] and its sleeve was designed by [[H. R. Giger]] and includes the band's new logo. Formed of five tracks, the album includes a rendition of "[[And did those feet in ancient time#Emerson, Lake & Palmer version|Jerusalem]]" which features the debut of the [[Moog Apollo]], a prototype [[polyphonic synthesizer]]. "Toccata" is a cover of the fourth movement of Piano Concerto No. 1 by Argentine composer [[Alberto Ginastera]] and contains synthesised percussion in the form of an acoustic drum kit fitted with pick-ups that triggered electronic sounds. The 29-minute track "[[Karn Evil 9]]" is the longest song recorded by the group. ''Brain Salad Surgery'' was released in November 1973 and reached No. 2 in the UK and No. 11 in the US.

From November 1973 to September 1974, the band toured North America and Europe which included a headline spot at the inaugural [[California Jam|California Jam Festival]] on 6 April 1974 at the [[Ontario Motor Speedway]] in [[Ontario, California]], to an attendance of 250,000 people. Their performance was broadcast across the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://donbranker.com/?q=node/11|title=Don Branker|publisher=donbranker.com|access-date=14 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116034531/http://donbranker.com/?q=node%2F11|archive-date=16 November 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band's live shows exhibited an unorthodox mix of virtuoso musicianship and over-the-top performances which received much criticism. Their theatrics included Emerson playing a piano as it spun, suspended, end-over-end; Palmer playing on a rotating drum platform; and a Hammond organ thrown around the stage to create [[Guitar feedback|feedback]]. Emerson often used a knife, given to him by [[Lemmy|Lemmy Kilmister]] who had roadied for the Nice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/lemmy_kilmister/biography.php|title=Lemmy Kilmister Biography|publisher=rottentomatoes.com|access-date=15 February 2012}}"According to Keith Emerson as written in his autobiography, two of Lemmy's Hitlerjugend knives were gifted to Keith Emerson himself during Lemmy's time spent as a roadie for The Nice. Emerson used these knives many times as "keyholders" during his famous wrestling sessions with the Hammond Organ during the shows with The Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer."</ref> to force the keys on the organ to stay down. Emerson used a large [[Moog modular synthesizer]] on stage but it was unreliable as heat affected its sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.popeye-x.com/tech/willalexander.htm|title=On'Board with Keith Emerson|publisher=popeye-x.com|access-date=15 February 2012}}"Bob Moog told Keith that it would never work live and that he was out of his mind for trying to take it out on the road."</ref> The band carried almost 40 tons of equipment for the tour.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Welcome back my friends to the show that...|first=James|last=Johnson |journal=NME|date=27 April 1974|url=http://ladiesofthelake.com/cabinet/nme74.html}}</ref> ELP were one of the top world concert draws during 1973-74.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stump |first=Paul |title=The Music's All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock |date=1997 |publisher=Quartet Books Limited |isbn=0 7043 8036 6 |page=184}}</ref> Performances from the band's 1973–74 tour were documented in the live album, ''[[Welcome Back, My Friends, to the Show That Never Ends ~ Ladies and Gentlemen]]'', released in August 1974 as a [[triple album|triple LP]]. The album peaked at No. 5 in the UK and No. 4 in the US.

===1974–1978: Hiatus and ''Works''===
Emerson, Lake & Palmer took an extended break in 1974. They regrouped in 1976 to record ''[[Works Volume 1]]'' at [[Mountain Studios]] in [[Montreux]], Switzerland and [[EMI Studios]] in Paris, France. It is a double album with one side of an LP containing songs by each member and a fourth of group material. Much of the album was recorded with an orchestral accompaniment; Emerson's side consists of his 18-minute, three-movement "Piano Concerto No. 1". Lake contributes five songs he co-wrote with Sinfield, and Palmer's includes two covers of classical pieces by [[Sergei Prokofiev]] and Bach. One of the two group tracks, "[[Fanfare for the Common Man (Emerson, Lake & Palmer song)|Fanfare for the Common Man]]", is a cover of the same-titled [[Fanfare for the Common Man|orchestral piece]] by [[Aaron Copland]], who gave permission to have the band release it. ''Works Volume 1'' was released in March 1977 and peaked at No. 9 in the UK and No. 12 in the US. A single of "Fanfare for the Common Man" was released and reached No. 2 in the UK, the band's highest charting UK single.<ref>[http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/emerson%2C%20lake%20%26%20palmer/ ELP UK chart history], The Official Charts Company.

[[File:Emerson Lake and Palmer three.jpg|thumb|left|Palmer performing on the ''Works'' tour, in 1978]]
In November 1977, ''[[Works Volume 2]]'' was released as a compilation of shorter tracks recorded from 1973 to 1976 during various album recording sessions. The album was not as commercially successful as the band's previous albums; it reached No. 20 in the UK and No. 37 in the US. Three tracks from the album were released as singles: "Tiger in a Spotlight", "Maple Leaf Rag", and "Watching Over You".

The two ''Works'' albums were supported by North American tours which lasted from May 1977 to February 1978, spanning over 120 dates.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=415}} Some early concerts in 1977 were performed with a hand-picked orchestra and choir, but the idea was shelved after 18 shows with the band due to budget constraints.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Ladies and Gentlemen...|first=Barbara|last=Charone|date=September 1977|journal=Gig|url=http://ladiesofthelake.com/cabinet/77Tour.html}}</ref> The final concert with the orchestra and choir took place on 26 August 1977 at the [[Olympic Stadium (Montreal)|Olympic Stadium]] in [[Montreal]] that was attended by an estimated 78,000 people, the highest attended Emerson, Lake & Palmer concert as a solo act.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=401}} It was released in 1979 as ''[[Emerson, Lake & Palmer in Concert]]'' and reached No. 73 in the US. Emerson wished for a double album release, but Atlantic Records decided against it due to the band's pending dissolution at its time of release. In 1993, the album was repackaged with additional tracks as ''Works Live'', and put out on video in 1998.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=401}} According to Lake on the ''Beyond the Beginning'' DVD documentary, the band lost around $3 million on the tour. Lake and Palmer blame Emerson for the loss as the use of an orchestra on tour was his idea.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

===1978–1979: ''Love Beach'' and break-up===
After their 1977–78 tour, the band discussed their next move. Emerson recalled that in order for the group to continue, "we would have to do a lot of cutting down" and considered the possibility of producing music with just a piano, bass guitar, and drums.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=417}} As the group were contractually obliged to record one more studio album, the band relocated to Emerson's home near [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]] in the [[Bahamas]] and recorded ''[[Love Beach]]'' at the nearby [[Compass Point Studios]] in 1978.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=237}} Lake did not carry out the production duties, leaving Emerson to complete the record on his own after his bandmates returned home when recording was complete.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=419}} The album has been dismissed by the band, who explained it was produced to fulfil a contractual obligation.<ref>{{cite video |people=Emerson Lake & Palmer |year=2008 |title=Beyond The Beginning |url=http://www.emersonlakepalmer.com/beyondbegin_press.htm |medium=DVD |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620063424/http://www.emersonlakepalmer.com/beyondbegin_press.htm |archive-date=20 June 2009  }}</ref> Sinfield is credited on the majority of the tracks as a lyricist except "Canario", an instrumental based on ''[[Fantasía para un gentilhombre]]'' by Spanish composer [[Joaquín Rodrigo]]. The second side is taken up with "Memoirs of an Officer and a Gentleman", a four-part 20-minute track that tells a [[coming of age]] story of a soldier during the [[World War II]]-era.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=419}} Its cover is a photograph of the group at a beach off an island from [[Salt Cay, Turks Islands]], "decked out as bare-chested late-seventies disco stars".{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=419}} Despite Emerson expressing his disapproval on the album's title and cover to Ertegun, neither was changed.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=419}} ''Love Beach'' was released in November 1978 and was poorly received by the music press. "All I Want Is You" was released as a single in the UK, but failed to chart. It did sell enough to be certified gold in the US for 500,000 copies sold, in January 1979.<ref name=RIAA/>

In early 1979, Palmer attempted to organise a farewell summer tour and have the group disband at its conclusion. Due to internal problems, such as "what we should play and how we should play it", the tour never materialised.{{sfn|Macan|2006|p=432}} As the band's demise became clear, Palmer formed a band called PM, which released an album called 1PM.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carl Palmer |url=http://www.emersonlakepalmer.com/CPBiography.html |website=Emerson, Lake & Palmer |access-date=24 July 2018 |archive-date=23 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181123233520/http://emersonlakepalmer.com/CPBiography.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===1985–1989: Related activity===
In 1985, Emerson and Lake formed [[Emerson, Lake & Powell]] with former [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]] drummer [[Cozy Powell]]. Palmer declined to participate in a reunion as he was busy with commitments with [[Asia (band)|Asia]]. Rumours also linked [[Bill Bruford]] to their new line-up, but he was committed to [[King Crimson]] and [[Earthworks (band)|Earthworks]]. The group's only album, ''[[Emerson, Lake & Powell (album)|Emerson Lake & Powell]]'', was released in June 1986 and charted at No. 35 in the UK and No. 23 in the US. The single "Touch and Go" went to No. 60 in the US and No. 2 on the ''Billboard'' [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart. The trio toured the album in 1986, playing material by the Nice and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.

In 1988, Emerson and Palmer joined with [[Robert Berry]] to form the band [[3 (1980s band)|3]]. They released an album, ''[[To the Power of Three]]'', in 1988.

===1991–2010: Reformation and 40th anniversary concert===
[[File:Emerson, Lake & Palmer 01.jpg|thumb|Emerson, Lake and Palmer performing in 1992]]
Thanks to [[Phil Carson]], in 1991, Emerson, Lake & Palmer reformed and issued a 1992 comeback album, ''[[Black Moon (album)|Black Moon]]'', on Victory Music. Their 1992–93 world tours were successful, culminating in a performance at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles in early 1993 that has been heavily [[bootleg recording|bootlegged]], but reportedly, Palmer suffered from [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] in one hand and Emerson had been treated for a [[Repetitive strain injury|repetitive stress disorder]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1994, the band released a follow-up album, ''[[In the Hot Seat]]''.

Emerson and Palmer eventually recovered enough to start touring again, beginning in 1996. Their tour schedules took them to Japan, South America, Europe, the United States and Canada, playing new versions of older work. They played in significantly smaller venues compared to their heyday (sometimes fewer than 500 people, as in [[Belo Horizonte]], Minas Gerais, Brazil). Their last show was in San Diego, California, in August 1998. Conflicts over a new album led to another break-up.

In April 2010, Emerson and Lake embarked on a North American tour, presenting an acoustic repertoire of their work. On 14 May 2010, [[Shout! Factory]] released ''[[A Time and a Place]]'', a 4-CD collection of Emerson, Lake & Palmer live tracks.

On 25 July 2010, Emerson, Lake & Palmer played a one-off 40th anniversary concert, headlining the [[High Voltage Festival]] event in [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], London. The entire concert was later released as the double-CD live album [[High Voltage (Emerson, Lake & Palmer album)|''High Voltage'']]. On 22 February 2011, Shout! released ''[[Live at Nassau Coliseum '78]]'', a 2-CD set live recording of an Emerson, Lake & Palmer concert on 9 February 1978 at the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] in Uniondale, New York.

On 29 August 2011, Emerson, Lake & Palmer released on DVD and Blu-ray ''... Welcome Back My Friends. 40th Anniversary Reunion Concert. High Voltage Festival – 25 July 2010'', the film of the 40th anniversary concert in [[Victoria Park, London|Victoria Park]], London.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audaud.com/2011/11/emerson-lake-and-palmer%E2%80%A6welcome-back-my-friends-40th-anniversary-reunion-concert/ |title=Emerson, Lake & Palmer...Welcome Back My Friends: 40th Anniversary Reunion Concert (2010/2011) – Audiophile Audition |publisher=Audaud.com |access-date=28 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406104527/http://audaud.com/2011/11/emerson-lake-and-palmer%E2%80%A6welcome-back-my-friends-40th-anniversary-reunion-concert/ |archive-date=6 April 2012  }}</ref> A Blu-ray and SD DVD of the concert was produced by Concert One Ltd, together with a definitive documentary of the band's 40-year history.

==Influence and appraisal==

A 2016 retrospective review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed "10 Essential Songs by EL&P" and noted, "ELP became one of rock's first supergroups upon forming in 1970…The result was a stretch of albums…that turned prog from a black-light-in-the-basement listening experience into a stadium-filling phenomenon. At their heart was Emerson, whose eternal quest for a bigger, grander sound (thanks to a bank of organs and synthesizers that grew to resemble a fortress onstage) helped make ELP one of the most accomplished and absorbing bands rock ever birthed."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/emerson-lake-and-palmer-10-essential-songs-80360/|title=Emerson, Lake and Palmer: 10 Essential Songs|last1=Epstein|first1=Dan|last2=Gehr|first2=Richard|date=11 March 2016|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=7 March 2019|last3=Heller|first3=Jason}}</ref> [[Koji Kondo]], Nintendo's first video game composer, cited ELP as a major influence on his work.<ref>{{cite web|date=31 January 2015|title=Weirdness: Legendary Composer Koji Kondo Drew Inspiration From '70s Rock Bands|url=https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/01/weirdness_legendary_composer_koji_kondo_drew_inspiration_from_70s_rock_bands|access-date=18 October 2021|website=Nintendo Life|language=en-GB}}</ref> [[Nobuo Uematsu]], best known for scoring the majority of titles in the ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series, cites ELP as one of his influences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobuouematsu.com/bob.html|title=Interview by Bob Rork|publisher=nobuouematsu.com|access-date=30 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821115948/http://www.nobuouematsu.com/bob.html|archive-date=21 August 2008}}</ref> The trio are described as "genuinely classically aware, and openly demonstrated their respect for classical music." They are said to have "formed a genuine fusion between rock and jazz" and were noted for their "virtuosity and their uninhibited aggression."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/12/how-keith-emersons-inventiveness-influenced-my-musical-career |title=How Keith Emerson's inventiveness influenced my musical career |work=The Guardian |date=12 March 2016 |accessdate=4 November 2021}}</ref>

Despite their success and influence, ELP received criticism from some music critics, one citing a popular joke from the 1970s: "How do you spell pretentious?

What is certain is that it consigned them to eternal rock notoriety. Even discounting [[Punk rock|Punk]], had not the musical climate changed enough to convince them that epics were out of fashion, both on record and in concert?"<ref>{{cite book |last=Stump |first=Paul |title=The Music's All that Matters: A History of Progressive Rock |date=1997 |publisher=Quartet Books Limited |isbn=0 7043 8036 6 |pages=215-8}}</ref> DJ [[John Peel]] went so far as to describe the band as "a tragic waste of talent and electricity".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/9bvr |title=The world's most reviled proggers (after Rush) get the deluxe retrospective treatment... |publisher=BBC |access-date=9 October 2012}}</ref> In an appraisal of the band's legacy, ''[[PopMatters]]'' journalist Sean Murphy said ELP "wore immoderation like a badge of courage", regardless of whether they were loved or loathed:

{{Quote|Here are three words that strike fear in the hearts of all those allergic to prog rock: Emerson. Lake. Palmer. Popular enough to have several songs still in the regular FM rotation, obscure enough to be forever relegated as one of "those" bands from a certain time and place (the ‘70s), ambitious enough to attempt things few if any other bands did, for better or worse, pretentious enough to earn the full-throated derision of holier-than-thou tastemakers.
