'''James Dewitt Yancey''' (February 7, 1974&nbsp;– February 10, 2006),<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jay-dee-mn0000809513 |title=Jay Dee &#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/j-dilla-mn0000428126 |title=J Dilla &#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref> better known by the stage names '''J Dilla''' and '''Jay Dee''', was an American record producer and rapper who emerged in the mid-1990s [[underground hip hop]] scene in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], as one third of the music group [[Slum Village]]. He was also a member of the [[Soulquarians]], a musical collective active during the late 1990s and early 2000s.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hip Hop Around the World: An Encyclopedia|chapter=J He brought revolutionary techniques to the producing world.

Although his life and career were short, J Dilla is widely considered to be one of the most influential producers in the hip-hop genre. It was described in ''The Guardian'' that "his affinity for crafting lengthy, melodic loops peppered with breakbeats and vocal samples took instrumental hip-hop into new, more musically complex realms."<ref name="theguardian-macinnes">{{cite web|first1=Paul|last1=MacInnes|access-date=2021-07-10|title=J Dilla dies|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/j-dilla|date=12 June 2011|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early life===
James Yancey grew up in [[Detroit]], Michigan. The family lived in a house on the northeast corner of McDougall and Nevada, on the east side of Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|last=Coombe |first=Doug |url=http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9544 |title=Let it roll |publisher=Metro Times |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref> His parents had musical backgrounds; his mother, Maureen “Ma Dukes” Yancey, is a former opera singer and his father, Beverly Dewitt Yancey, was a jazz bassist, and performed [[Harlem Globetrotters|Globetrotters]] half-time shows for several years.<ref>At 5:10, mentioned by Ma Dukes. {{Citation|last=Fuse|title=J Dilla {{!}} Crate Diggers|date=2013-03-20|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XL3ENrZwjmw&t=310|access-date=2019-02-26}}</ref> His mother said that he could "match pitch perfect harmony" when he was a pre-verbal infant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2015/10/ma-dukes-interview-dillatronic-j-dilla|title=J Dilla's Mom on the New 'Dillatronic' Album and Why She Thought Her Son Was an Alien|website=Complex.com}}</ref>

Along with a wide range of other musical genres, Yancey developed a passion for hip hop music. After transferring from Davis Aerospace Technical High School to [[Pershing High School]], he met classmates T3 and [[Baatin]], and became friends with them through their mutual interest in rap battles. The three formed the rap group called [[Slum Village]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.j-dilla.com/biography |title=Biography |website=J-dilla.com |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref> He also took up beat-making using a simple tape deck as the center of his studio.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />  During these teenage years he "stayed in the basement alone" in order to train himself to produce beats with his growing record collection.

===Early career===
In 1992, he met the Detroit musician [[Amp Fiddler]], who let Jay Dee use his [[Akai MPC]], of which he quickly gained mastery. Fiddler, while playing keyboards with [[Funkadelic]] on the group's slot on the 1994 [[Lollapalooza]] tour, met [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]], who were also on the lineup. This is where Fiddler introduced Q-Tip to Jay Dee, who gave Q-Tip a Slum Village demo tape. In 1995, Jay Dee and MC [[Phat Kat]] formed [[1st Down]] and became the first Detroit hip hop group to sign with a major label ([[Payday Records]])—a deal that was ended after one single when the label terminated. 

In 1995 he also recorded 'Yester Years EP' with 5 Elementz (a group consisting of [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], Thyme and Mudd). In 1996, he formed the group Slum Village and recorded what would become their debut album ''[[Fan-Tas-Tic (Vol. 1)|Fantastic, Vol. 1]]'' at RJ Rice Studios. Upon its release in 1997, the album quickly became popular with fans of Detroit hip hop. Many journalists compared Slum Village to A Tribe Called Quest. However, Jay Dee said that he felt uncomfortable with the comparison and often voiced it in several interviews.

{{quote|It was kinda fucked up [getting that stamp] because people automatically put us in that [Tribe] category. That was actually a category that we didn’t actually wanna be in. I thought the music came off like that, but we didn’t realize that shit then. I mean, you gotta listen to the lyrics of the shit. Niggas was talking about getting [[fellatio|head]] from bitches. It was like a nigga from [[Native Tongues]] never woulda said that shit. I don’t know how to say it. It’s kinda fucked up because the audience we were trying to give to were actually people we hung around. Me, myself, I hung around regular ass Detroit cats. Not the [[conscious rap|backpack shit]] that people kept putting out there like that. I mean, I ain’t never carried no goddamn backpack. But like I said, I understand to a certain extent. I guess that’s how the beats came off on some smooth type of shit. And at that time, that’s when [[Ruff Ryders]] [was out] and there was a lot of hard shit on the radio so our thing was we’re gonna do exactly what’s not on the radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/features/2010/02/j-dilla-the-lost-interview-circa-2004/3/ |title=J Dilla, The Lost Interview [circa 2004&#93; - Page 3 of 3 - XXL |website=Xxlmag.com |date=2010-02-10 |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref>}}

By the mid-1990s Jay Dee had a string of singles and [[remix]] projects, for [[Janet Jackson]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[De La Soul]], [[Busta Rhymes]], A Tribe Called Quest, [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]]'s solo album and others. Many of these [[Hip hop production|productions]] were released without his name recognition, being credited to [[The Ummah]], a production collective composed of him, Q-Tip and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] of A Tribe Called Quest, and later [[Raphael Saadiq]] of [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]]. However, he was given songwriting credit on all of his non-remix productions under The Ummah.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/4777742 A Tribe Called Quest – The Love Movement] Discogs. Accessed on February 7, 2017.</ref> 

Under this umbrella, Jay Dee produced original songs and remixes for Janet Jackson, Busta Rhymes, [[Brand New Heavies]], Something For the People, trip hop artists Crustation and many others.  He handled production on seven tracks from The Pharcyde's album ''[[Labcabincalifornia]]'', released in the holiday season of 1995 and ''[[Hello (Poe album)|Hello]],'' the debut album by [[Poe (singer)|Poe]], [[1995 in music|released earlier that year]] on [[Modern Records (1980)|Modern Records]].<ref>Rocha, Del X.{{cite web |url=http://flo1071.com/j-dilla-the-legacy-lives/ |title=J Dilla…The Legacy Lives...FLO1071.com |date=2016-05-12 |access-date=2016-12-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101021639/http://flo1071.com/j-dilla-the-legacy-lives/ |archive-date=2017-01-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Performing career===
2000 marked the [[major label]] debut of [[Slum Village]] with ''[[Fantastic, Vol. 2]]'', creating a new following for J Dilla as a producer and an MC. He was also a founding member of the production collective known as The [[Soulquarians]] (along with Ahmir "[[Questlove]]" Thompson, [[D'Angelo]] and [[James Poyser]] amongst others) which earned him more recognition. He subsequently worked with [[Erykah Badu]], [[Poe (singer)|Poe]], [[Talib Kweli]], and [[Common (rapper)|Common]]—contributing heavily to the latter's critically acclaimed breakthrough album, ''[[Like Water for Chocolate (album)|Like Water for Chocolate]]''.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

His debut as a solo artist came in 2001 with the single "[[Fuck The Police (J Dilla song)|Fuck the Police]]" (Up Above Records), followed by the album ''[[Welcome 2 Detroit]]'', which began British independent record label [[BBE Records|BBE]]'s "Beat Generation" series. In 2001, Jay Dee began using the name "J Dilla" (an attempt to differentiate himself from [[Jermaine Dupri]] who also goes by "J.D."), and left Slum Village to pursue a major label solo career with [[MCA Records]].

In 2002, Dilla produced [[Frank-N-Dank]]'s ''[[48 Hours (Frank-N-Dank album)|48 Hours]]'', as well as a solo album, but neither record was ever released, although the former surfaced through [[Bootleg recording|bootlegging]].<ref name=groove>Haleem, Aadel. [http://www.grooveattack.de/distribution/artist_add.php3?artistid=85&interpret=Jay+Dee&title=Jay+Dee+Interview&label= Jay Dee Interview]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. GrooveAttack.de. Accessed April 8, 2008.</ref> When Dilla finished working with Frank-N-Dank on the ''48 Hours'' album, MCA Records requested a record with a larger commercial appeal, and the artists re-recorded the majority of the tracks, this time using little to no samples.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Despite this, neither versions of the album were successful, and Dilla stated that he was disappointed that the music never got out to the fans.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Around this time, Dilla also assisted in the production of singer and fellow Soulquarian [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]]'s second album, ''[[Love for Sale (Bilal album)|Love for Sale]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|date=n.d.|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bilal-mn0000057280/biography|title=Bilal|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 20, 2020}}</ref> The singer credited Dilla with showing him a unique approach to [[drum programming]]: "He had this thing where no matter what he picked up he could bend his will into it. Just because you hear it so strong in your head you can throw the funk in it."<ref>{{cite interview|subject=Bilal|interviewer=Civil Writes|date=June 16, 2010|url=https://www.vibe.com/2010/06/long-convo-withbilal|access-date=July 20, 2020|magazine=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]|title=A Long Convo With...BILAL}}</ref>

Dilla was signed to a solo deal with [[MCA Records]] in 2002. Although Dilla was known as a producer rather than an MC, he chose to rap on the album and have the music produced by some of his favorite producers,<ref>J Dilla, ''Ruff Draft'' (2007), liner notes</ref> such as [[Madlib]], [[Pete Rock]], [[Hi-Tek]], Supa Dave West, [[Kanye West]], [[Nottz]], [[Waajeed]] and others. The album was shelved due to internal changes at the label and MCA.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}

While the record with MCA stalled, Dilla recorded ''[[Ruff Draft]]'', released exclusively to vinyl by German label Groove Attack.<ref name=autogenerated1>Liner notes by Ronnie Reese, ''Ruff Draft'' (2007)</ref>  The album was also unsuccessful, but his work from this point on was increasingly released through independent record labels. In a 2003 interview with Groove Attack, Dilla talked about this change of direction:
{{quote|text=You know, if I had a choice... Skip the major labels and just put it out yourself, man... Trust me. I tell everybody it's better to do it yourself and let the Indies come after you instead of going in their [direction] and getting a deal and you have to wait. It ain't fun. Take it from me. Right now, I'm on MCA but it feels like I'm an unsigned artist still. It's cool. It's a blessing, but damn I'm like, 'When's my shit gonna come out? I'm ready now, what's up?'}}

===Later life and death===
[[Los Angeles|LA]]-based producer and MC [[Madlib]] began collaborating with J Dilla, and the pair formed the group [[Jaylib]] in 2002, releasing an album called ''[[Champion Sound]]'' in 2003.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> J Dilla relocated from Detroit to Los Angeles in 2004 and appeared on [[concert tour|tour]] with Jaylib in Spring 2004.

J Dilla's [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura|illness]] and medication caused dramatic weight loss in 2003 onwards, forcing him to publicly confirm speculation about his health in 2004. Despite a slower output of major releases and production credits in 2004 and 2005, his [[cult following|cult]] status remained strong within his core audience, as evidenced by unauthorized circulation of his underground "beat tapes" (instrumental, and raw working materials), mostly through internet [[file sharing]].<ref name="theguardian-macinnes"/><ref name="auto">''Detroit Free Press'', February 23, 2006</ref>

Articles in publications ''[[URB (magazine)|URB]]'' (March 2004) and ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' (June 2005) confirmed rumors of ill health and hospitalization during this period, but these were downplayed by Jay himself. The seriousness of his condition became public in November 2005 when J Dilla toured [[Europe]] performing from a wheelchair. It was later revealed that he suffered from [[thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura]] (a rare blood disease), and [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]].<ref name="theguardian-macinnes"/><ref name="auto"/> 

Near the end of his of life, he was mostly hospital bound, which eventually left him in debt – after his medical insurance was dropped following a late payment. His mother, Maureen Yancey, recalled paying $500,000 a month.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Washington|first=Glynn|editor1-first=John|editor1-last=Biewen|editor2-first=Alexa|editor2-last=Dilworth|author-link=Glynn Washington|url=http://northcarolina.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.5149/northcarolina/9781469633138.001.0001/upso-9781469633138|title=Reality Radio, Second Edition: Telling True Stories in Sound|date=2017-02-13|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-4696-3313-8|edition=2|pages=150|language=en|chapter=Finding the Beats|doi=10.5149/northcarolina/9781469633138.001.0001}}</ref>

J Dilla died on February 10, 2006, at his home in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], three days after his 32nd birthday and the release of his final album ''[[Donuts (album)|Donuts]]''. Maureen said that the cause was [[cardiac arrest]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Sanneh |first=Kelefa |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05EEDA123EF937A25751C0A9609C8B63&scp=8&sq=J.%20Dilla&st=cse |title=James Yancey, 32, Producer Known for Soulful Hip-Hop - Obituary (Obit); Biography - NYTimes.com |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2006-02-14 |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|access-date=2021-07-10|title=US hip-hop producer dies aged 32|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4706602.stm|date=12 February 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first1=Alex|last1=Mar|access-date=2021-07-10|title=J Dilla Dead at Thirty-two|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/j-dilla-dead-at-thirty-two-90005/|date=13 February 2006}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5205096 |title=Hip-Hop Producer, Rapper Jay Dee AKA J Dilla |publisher=NPR |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref>

==Posthumously released music==
At the time of his death, Dilla had several projects planned for future completion and release.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> According to founding Slum Village member T3 in an interview in March 2015, J Dilla had about 150 unreleased beats, some of which featured on Slum Village's album entitled ''Yes!'', which released June 16, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundofboston.com/interview-slum-village/ |title=Interview: Slum Village - Sound of Boston - Boston Music Blog |date=9 March 2015 |publisher=Sound of Boston |access-date=2015-11-30}}</ref>

''[[The Shining (J Dilla album)|The Shining]]'' was "75% completed when Dilla died" and was completed by [[Karriem Riggins]] and released on August 8, 2006, on [[Barely Breaking Even|BBE Records]].<ref>''Detroit Free Press'', June 29, 2006</ref>

''[[Ruff Draft]]'' was reissued as a double CD/LP set in March 2007 and is sometimes considered his third solo album. The reissue contains unreleased material from the ''Ruff Draft'' sessions and instrumentals. It was also released in a cassette tape format, paying homage to Dilla's dirty, grimy sound (he was known for recording over two-tracked instrumentals).<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

''[[Sniperlite]]'' was an EP released by the hip hop collaboration Dilla Ghost Doom, consisting of J Dilla, [[Ghostface Killah]], and [[MF Doom]].  It was recorded sometime in 2005 before Dilla's passing.  It was subsequently released in 2008 by [[Stones Throw Records]].

''[[Jay Love Japan]]'' was announced in 2005 as his debut release on the Operation Unknown label. Though it saw a 2006 release in Japan, it was heavily bootlegged elsewhere and did not receive an official release until 2016.

''[[Champion Sound]]'', J Dilla's and Madlib's collaborative album, was reissued in June 2007 by [[Stones Throw Records]] as a 2-CD Deluxe Edition with instrumentals and b-sides.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

''[[Yancey Boys]]'', the debut album by J Dilla's younger brother [[Illa J|John Yancey]], was released in 2008 on [[Delicious Vinyl Records]]. It is produced entirely by J Dilla and features rapping by his brother, under the name '''Illa J'''. Stones Throw Records released a digital instrumental version of the album in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stonesthrow.com/store/album/jdilla/yancey-boys-instrumentals |title=J Dilla &#124; Yancey Boys Instrumentals &#124; Stones Throw Records |website=Stonesthrow.com |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref>

''[[Jay Stay Paid]]'', an album featuring 28 previously unreleased instrumental tracks made at various points in his career, was released in 2009 by [[Nature Sounds]]. Vocals to a select few of the tracks were provided by rappers who were close to Dilla though the majority of the album is instrumental. The project was mixed and arranged by [[Pete Rock]].

In 2010, unreleased production and vocals from J Dilla were featured on [[Slum Village]]'s sixth studio album ''[[Villa Manifesto]]'', the first album with all five members.

In December 2011, Jonathan Taylor, CEO of the Yancey Music Group (founded by Dilla's mother Maureen Yancey), told the UK's Conspiracy Worldwide radio show that the album ''Rebirth of Detroit'' was ready for a May 2012 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/music/index.ssf/2012/01/new_j_dilla_album_rebirth_of_d.html |title=New J.

In 2014, J Dilla's long-lost MCA Records album entitled ''[[The Diary (J Dilla album)|The Diary]]'' was scheduled for release, but was delayed to April 15, 2016, via Mass Appeal Records. Intended for release in 2002, the album is a collection of Dilla's vocal performances over production by [[Madlib]], [[Pete Rock]], [[Nottz]], [[House Shoes]], [[Karriem Riggins]], and others. The first single is the album's intro cut, "The Introduction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2016/02/18/j-dillas-lost-long-album-the-diary-getting-release/ |title=J Dilla's Lost Long Album, "The Diary", Getting Release |website=BallerStatus.com |date=February 18, 2016}}</ref>

In 2020, Dres of [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]] announced that he would be releasing a collaborative album with J Dilla titled ''No Words'', with unreleased instrumentals of Dilla's provided with the cooperation of his mother.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.okayplayer.com/news/j-dilla-dres-collab-album-no-words-2020.htm|title=Black Sheep's Dres Announces New J Dilla Collab Album 'No Words'|author=Elijah C.

"Highly influential for both producers and drummers", he made "innovative" use of the MPC sampler, by employing real-time rhythms and choosing not to [[Quantization (music)|quantize]] them, thus creating a "drunk" and "laid-back" style which "[was] a significant contribution to contemporary popular music that evade[d] quick interpretation, transcription and definition". [[Questlove]] – who considers Dilla the "world’s greatest drummer" – stated that he "invented the sound we call [[Neo soul|neo-soul]]" and actively sought to emulate Dilla.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Brennan|first=Matt|url=https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190683863.001.0001/oso-9780190683863|title=Kick It: A Social History of the Drum Kit|date=2020-03-26|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=978-0-19-068386-3|edition=1|pages=301–302|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190683863.001.0001}}</ref> The University of Illinois' Adam Kruse states that Dilla is "considered one of the greatest beat producers in hip-hop's history".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kruse|first=Adam J.|date=2016|title=Featherless Dinosaurs and the Hip-Hop Simulacrum: Reconsidering Hip-Hop's Appropriateness for the Music Classroom|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24755676|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=102|issue=4|pages=13–21|doi=10.1177/0027432116638904|jstor=24755676|s2cid=147952067|issn=0027-4321}}</ref>

[[Dave Chappelle]] gives a special dedication to J Dilla in his movie ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'', which includes the statement: "This film is dedicated to the life and memory of Music Producer J Dilla, aka Jay Dee (James D. Yancey)". The film focuses mostly on members of the [[Soulquarians]], a collective of hip-hop musicians of which Yancey was also a member.

J Dilla's music has been used in various television programs. In 2006, [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programing block [[Adult Swim]] played the songs "Waves", "Welcome to the Show", and "Mash" during the [[Bumper (broadcasting)|commercial bumpers]] in between shows, as well as a number of tracks on their [[Chrome Children]] EP. In May 2010, [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[mobile network]] [[O2 Broadband|O2]] used [[Jaylib]]'s "The Red" instrumental in their "Pool Party" ad.<ref name="02 Pool Party">{{cite web|url=http://www.tvadmusic.co.uk/2010/05/o2-pool-party/ |title=O2&nbsp;– Pool Party |publisher=TV Ad Music |date=2010-05-15 |access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref> A recent BBC documentary inspired by the Olympic runner [[Usain Bolt]] contained two J Dilla-produced songs—"So Far To Go" by [[Common (entertainer)|Common]] and "[[Runnin' (The Pharcyde song)|Runnin']]" by [[The Pharcyde]].

In February 2007, a year after his death, J Dilla posthumously received the [[PLUG Awards]] Artist of the Year as well as the award for Record Producer of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1055072/band-of-horses-j-dilla-reap-plug-awards |title=Band Of Horses, J Dilla Reap PLUG Awards |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref> In Dilla's hometown of Detroit, [[Detroit Techno]] veteran [[Carl Craig]] has fronted a movement to install a plaque in honor of J Dilla in [[Conant Gardens]] (where the artist grew up and initiated his career). A resolution for the proposed plaque was passed by the Detroit Entertainment Commission in May 2010, and is currently awaiting approval by the [[Detroit City Council]].<ref name="J Dilla Plaque Proposed to Stand in Conant Gardens">{{cite web |url=http://theloopdetroit.com/2010/05/j-dilla-plaque-proposed-to-stand-in-conant-gardens/ |title=J.

Despite these accolades, there have been documented conflicts between his mother and the executor of his estate Arthur Erk regarding future Dilla releases. In an interview with [[LA Weekly]], Erk described how difficult it was for the estate to "protect his legacy" due to bootlegging and unofficial mixtapes.<ref name="Who's Biting J Dilla's Beats?">{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Jeff |url=http://www.laweekly.com/2008-06-19/music/who-39-s-biting-j-dilla-39-s-beats/1 |title=Who's Biting J Dilla's Beats? &#124; Music &#124; Los Angeles &#124; Los Angeles News and Events |publisher=LA Weekly |date=2008-06-18 |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref>  He stressed how important it was for the estate to gather all possible income related to Dilla's name, as Dilla had to borrow money from the government due to mounting medical bills at the end of his life.<ref name="Who's Biting J Dilla's Beats?"/>

A few weeks later Dilla's mother, who has appeared on such unofficial mixtapes as Busta Rhymes' Dillagence, gave her take on these issues. In addition to stating that Arthur Erk and Dilla's estate has chosen not to communicate with his family, she has stated that he has barred anyone from use of Dilla's likeness or name.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com">{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Jeff |url=http://www.laweekly.com/westcoastsound/2008/07/24/an-interview-with-j-dillas-mother-ms-maureen-yancey |title=An Interview with J Dilla's Mother, Ms. Maureen Yancey |publisher=L.A. Weekly |date=2008-07-24 |access-date=2015-11-30}}</ref>

{{quote|text=One of the things Dilla wanted me to do with his legacy was to use it to help others, people with illness, kids who were musically gifted but had little hope due to poverty. I wanted to use my contacts to help people out and it was squashed because we weren’t in compliance with the state and there was nothing we could do about it. I’m Dilla’s mother and I can’t use Dilla’s name or likeness, but I know that I still can honor him by doing his work.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/>}}

Mrs. Yancey also has mentioned that Erk was in fact Dilla's accountant and not his business manager in his lifetime, and that he fell into his position because she and Dilla were first and foremost concerned about his health and not with getting paperwork in order.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/> She also stated that Dilla's friends in the hip-hop community, such as Erykah Badu, Busta Rhymes, Madlib, Common and The Roots, have contacted her personally for future projects with Dilla beats, but the estate has vetoed all future projects not contracted prior to Dilla's death.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/> She also implied that Dilla would not support the estate's practices, such as their prosecution of bootleggers and file sharers.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/>

Due to Dilla's debt to the government, the family receives no income from projects.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/> Dilla's children are being supported by the social security their mothers have drawn.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/> Likewise, Mrs. Yancey is also still paying off Dilla's medical bills that she helped finance, leaving her also in tremendous debt. She still lives in the same Detroit ghetto, is still a daycare worker at Conant Gardens and also suffers from lupus, the same disease which killed Dilla.<ref name="blogs.laweekly.com"/> To help pay the cost of medication and keep her household afloat, Delicious Vinyl donated all proceeds of Jay Dee – The Delicious Vinyl Years to Mrs. Yancey in 2007. In 2008, Giant Peach created a donation PayPal account for her and RenSoul.com released a charity mixtape.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rensoul.com/madukes.php|title=Renaissance Soul Detroit v5.0 - www.rensoul.com|date=February 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218220431/http://rensoul.com/madukes.php|archive-date=2009-02-18}}</ref>

According to his mother, the family lost their old home in Detroit due to her taking care of Dilla in his final days.<ref name="The Battle for J Dilla's Legacy">{{cite web|url=http://www.stonesthrow.com/news/2009/01/the-battle-for-j-dilla-s-legacy |title=The Battle for J Dilla's Legacy &#124; Stones Throw Records |website=Stonesthrow.com |access-date=2014-02-05}}</ref> The mother of one of Dilla's children, Monica Whitlow, also broke her silence on the issue of the estate and his legacy:

On January 24, 2010, an announcement was made on j-dilla.com, regarding the J Dilla Estate and the Yancey family.
