==Career==
From 2002 to 2018, Thorpe was the frontman of the indie pop band [[Wild Beasts]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefourohfive.com/music/article/track-of-the-day-hayden-thorpe-formerly-of-wild-beasts-arrives-strong-as-ever-on-his-own-with-love-crimes-155|title=Track Of The Day: Hayden Thorpe, formerly of Wild Beasts, is strong as ever on his own with 'Love Crimes'|last=http://thefourohfive.com|website=The 405|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> which he initially co-founded as a duo with guitarist Ben Little.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/wild-beasts-hayden-thorpe-shares-first-new-solo-song-listen/|title=Wild Beasts' Hayden Thorpe Shares First New Solo Song: Listen|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> Eventually expanding into a four-piece, the band released five studio albums on [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]] to much critical acclaim, yet only modest commercial success. Following the band's dissolution, Thorpe pursued a solo career, and released his debut album ''[[Diviner (album)|Diviner]]'' through Domino in May 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2019/02/21/wild-beasts-hayden-thorpe-debut-solo-track-diviner-watch|title=Former Wild Beasts frontman Hayden Thorpe returns with debut solo track 'Diviner'|last=Subscribe|website=DIY|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref>

In July 2021, Thorpe announced his second album, ''[[Moondust for My Diamond]]'' to be released 15 October 2021 via [[Domino Recording Company|Domino Records]], the announcement came with a video for the song "The Universe Is Always Right".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/hayden-thorpe-announces-details-of-second-solo-album-moondust-for-my-diamond-2986425}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==

Thorpe is often noted for his distinct, operatic [[countertenor]] vocal style, which critics commonly described as being both unusual and an [[acquired taste]] in the field of indie rock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/wild-beasts-36-1274855|title=Wild Beasts' Hayden Thorpe: 'I never realised my voice was like Marmite'|website=[[NME]]|language=en|access-date=2019-04-24}}</ref> Thorpe has cited [[Leonard Cohen]], [[Kate Bush]] and [[The Smiths]] as amongst his musical influences, as well as writer [[Arthur Rimbaud]] on his lyrics.
