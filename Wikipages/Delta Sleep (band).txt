== History ==

=== Early years, ''Management'', and ''Twin Galaxies'' (2010-2017) ===
Delta Sleep emerged from a band called Sávlön, featuring bass player Maria Sullivan and drummer Adam Brogan beside Yüceil and Hodgson. They released a self-titled EP in 2010, followed by ''Management'' in 2013.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=15 June 2015|title=Delta Sleep - Twin Galaxies|url=https://echoesanddust.com/2015/06/delta-sleep-twin-galaxies/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 January 2021|website=echoesanddust.com}}</ref> Shortly after the release of ''Management'', Sullivan and Brogan left the band to start a family and focus on other musical projects, respectively. They were replaced by Dave Jackson and Blake Hodgson, both friends of the band.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=19 February 2019|title=Interview with Delta Sleep|url=https://mathcoreindex.com/2019/02/19/delta-sleep-interview-photo-essay/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 January 2021|website=mathcoreindex.com}}</ref> Delta Sleep released their first full-length album ''Twin Galaxies'' in January 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=8 June 2015|title=Album Review Twin Galaxies by Delta Sleep|url=https://altdialogue.com/2015/06/08/album-review-twin-galaxies-by-delta-sleep/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 January 2021|website=altdialogue.com}}</ref>

Following cancelled tour dates due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Delta Sleep gradually released their [[compilation album]] ''Soft Sounds'' between May and July 2020.

=== ''Spring Island'' (2021-present) ===
In June 2021, Delta Sleep released their new single "The Detail" and announced their third album ''Spring Island'' which was supposed to be released on September 10th.<ref>{{Cite web|date=9 June 2021|title=Delta Sleep to release new studio album “Spring Island” on September 10th 2021|url=https://www.grande-rock.com/news/delta-sleep-to-release-new-studio-album-spring-island-on-september-10th-2021|url-status=live|access-date=11 June 2021}}</ref> On August 15th, Delta Sleep announced that Spring Island was delayed to November 12th due to delayed vinyl manufacturing caused by [[Brexit]].

== Musical style ==
Both ''Twin Galaxies'' and ''Ghost City'' are concept albums that follow a protagonist overcoming hardship. ''Twin Galaxies'' follows a man whose life was uprooted by a flood on his way to find new hope. In ''Ghost City'', a woman escapes from a [[Dystopia|dystopian]], oppressive city to find a better life more in connection with nature. In contrast, ''Younger Years'' was written without an overarching concept in mind.<ref name=":3" />

Delta Sleep's musical style has been described as [[math rock]] and [[indie rock]].<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Many songs feature odd time signatures and are structured unconventionally.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=10 August 2018|title=Delta Sleep discuss Ghost City|url=https://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/219276/9|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=6 January 2021|website=stereoboard.com}}</ref>
