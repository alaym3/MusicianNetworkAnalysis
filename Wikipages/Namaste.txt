''Namaste'' (''Namas'' + ''te'') is derived from [[Sanskrit]] and is a combination of the word ''namas'' and the second person [[dative]] pronoun in its [[enclitic]] form, ''[[Sanskrit pronouns and determiners#First- and second-person pronouns|te]]''.<ref name=fm>Thomas Burrow, ''The Sanskrit Language'', pp. 263–268</ref> The word ''namaḥ'' takes the [[sandhi]] form ''namas'' before the sound ''te''.<ref name=fn>Thomas Burrow, ''The Sanskrit Language'', pp. 100–102</ref><ref>[http://sanskritdictionary.org/namah Namah] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827185125/http://sanskritdictionary.org/namah |date=2014-08-27 }} Sanskrit Dictionary</ref>

It is found in the Vedic literature. ''Namas-krita'' and related terms appear in the Hindu scripture ''[[Rigveda]]'' such as in the ''Vivaha Sukta'', verse 10.85.22<ref>"उदीर्ष्वातो विश्वावसो '''नमसेळा महे त्वा''' । अन्यामिच्छ प्रफर्व्यं सं जायां पत्या सृज [https://sa.wikisource.org/s/139l ॥२२॥], Griffith translates it as, "Rise up from hence, Visvavasu, '''with reverence we worship thee'''.

According to the Indologist Stephen Phillips, the terms "''te'' and ''tvam''" are an informal, familiar form of "you" in Sanskrit, and it is typically not used for unfamiliar adults. It is reserved for someone familiar, intimate, divine or a child.<ref name=phillips2009p272/><ref>This is similar to ''[[T–V distinction|tu / vous]]'' of French and Romance languages in Europe, states the Indologist [[Patrick Olivelle]], see: {{cite book|author=Patrick Olivelle|title=Manu's Code of Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PnHo02RtONMC |year=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-517146-4|pages=346 note 11.205}}</ref> By using the dative form of ''tvam'' in the greeting ''Namas-te'', there is an embedded secondary, metaphorical sense in the word. This is the basis of the pragmatic meaning of ''Namas-te'', that is "salutations to the (divine) child (in your heart)", states Phillips.<ref name=phillips2009p272>{{cite book|author=Stephen H.

In the contemporary era, ''namaḥ'' means 'bow', 'obeisance', 'reverential salutation' or 'adoration'<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche?dictionary=mwd&st=namas&prst=exact&en=&pren=exact&maxhits=50 | contribution = Cologne Digital Sanskrit Lexicon | type = search results | title = Cologne Digital Sanskrit Dictionaries | publisher = [[University of Cologne]] | access-date = March 24, 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130925085740/http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/cgi-bin/tamil/recherche?dictionary=mwd&st=namas&prst=exact&en=&pren=exact&maxhits=50 | archive-date = September 25, 2013 | url-status = dead }}.</ref> and ''te'' means 'to you' (singular [[dative case]] of 'tvam').

A less common variant is used in the case of three or more people being addressed namely ''Namo vaḥ'' which is a combination of ''namaḥ'' and the enclitic second person plural pronoun ''vaḥ''.<ref name="fm"/> The word ''namaḥ'' takes the [[sandhi]] form ''namo'' before the sound ''v''.<ref name="fn"/> An even less common variant is used in the case of two people being addressed, namely, ''Namo vām'', which is a combination of ''namaḥ'' and the enclitic second person [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] pronoun ''vām''.<ref name="fm"/>

==Anjali Mudra==
The gesture of folding hands during a Namaste is called the ''[[Añjali Mudrā]]''. In addition to Namaste, this ''mudra'' is one of the postures found in Indian classical dance such as [[Bharatanatyam]],<ref name="Anami Bhandage31021–31040">{{cite journal | last=Anami | first=Basavaraj S. | last2=Bhandage | first2=Venkatesh A. | title=A vertical-horizontal-intersections feature based method for identification of bharatanatyam double hand mudra images | journal=Multimedia Tools and Applications | publisher=Springer Science | volume=77 | issue=23 | date=2018-06-04 | issn=1380-7501 | doi=10.1007/s11042-018-6223-y | pages=31021–31040}}</ref> and in yoga practice.<ref name="CarrollCarroll2012">{{cite book|author1=C Carroll|author2=R Carroll|title=Mudras of India: A Comprehensive Guide to the Hand Gestures of Yoga and Indian Dance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fn_c9wbLIeAC&pg=PA44|year=2012|publisher=SD Publishers|isbn=978-0-85701-067-4|pages=44–46}}</ref> It is widely found in Indian temple reliefs and sculpture in mandapam, at entrances and iconography such as the Lingobhavamurti of [[Shaivism]].<ref>{{cite journal|author = Douglas Barrett| title= An Early Cola Lingodbhavamurti|journal = The British Museum Quarterly| volume= 28| number= 1/2 (Summer) |year= 1964| pp= 32-39|jstor=4422848}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title=Indian Sculpture Newly Acquired|author= Stella Kramrisch| journal=Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin (Winter)|year= 1957|volume= 52|number= 252| pp=30-38 with Fig 2 and 3|jstor=379036}}</ref> The Anjali mudra differs from Namaste by being a non-verbal gesture, while Namaste can be said with or without any gesture. According to Bhaumik and Govil, the Anjali mudra and Namaskara mudra are very similar but have a subtle difference. The back of the thumbs in Anjali mudra face the chest and are perpendicular to other fingers, while the thumbs in Namaskara mudra are aligned with the other fingers.<ref name="BhaumikGovil2020">{{cite book | last=Bhaumik | first=Gopa | last2=Govil | first2=Mahesh Chandra | title=Communications in Computer and Information Science | chapter=Buddhist Hasta Mudra Recognition Using Morphological Features | publisher=Springer Singapore | publication-place=Singapore | year=2020 | isbn=978-981-15-6314-0 | issn=1865-0929 | doi=10.1007/978-981-15-6315-7_29 | pages=356–364}}</ref>

Anjali mudra is described in Sanskrit texts such as in verse 9.127–128 of the ''[[Natya Shastra]]'' (200 BCE – 200 CE), in temple architecture texts dated after the 6th-century CE such as in verse 5.67 of the ''Devata murti prakarana'' and those on painting called the ''Citrasutras''. The ''Natya Shastra'', a classical Indian dance text, describes it to be a posture where the two hands are folded together in a reverential state and that this is used to pray before a deity, receive any person one reveres and also to greet friends. The ''Natya Shastra'' further states that for prayers inside a temple, the Anjali mudra should be placed near one's head or above, while meeting someone venerable it is placed in front of one's face or chin, and for friends near one's chest.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Theory of Indian Painting: the Citrasutras, their Uses and Interpretations|author=Isabella Nardi|year=2003|publisher=SOAS, University of London|pages=132-134, also see Figure 67 on page 273}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Theatre in Southeast Asia|author = James R.

==Uses==
The gesture is widely used throughout the Indian subcontinent, parts of [[Asia]] and beyond where people of South and Southeast Asian origins have migrated.<ref name=ying/> ''Namaste'' or ''namaskar'' is used as a respectful form of greeting, acknowledging and welcoming a relative, guest or stranger.<ref name=jonesryan/> In some contexts, ''Namaste'' is used by one person to express gratitude for assistance offered or given, and to thank the other person for his or her generous kindness.<ref>Joseph Shaules (2007), Deep Culture: The Hidden Challenges of Global Living, {{ISBN|978-1847690166}}, pp. 68–70</ref>

''Namaskar'' is also part of the 16 [[upachara]]s used inside temples or any place of formal [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship). ''Namaste'' in the context of deity worship, scholars conclude,<ref>James Lochtefeld, The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 2, {{ISBN|0-8239-2287-1}}, 720 pp.</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Fuller|first=C.

It expresses politeness, courtesy, honor, and hospitality from one person to the other. It is used in goodbyes as well.  This is sometimes expressed, in ancient Hindu scriptures such as [[Taittiriya Upanishad]], as [[Atithi Devo Bhava]] (literally, treat the guest like a god).<ref>Kelkar (2010), {{doi-inline|10.1080/15332969.2010.510722|A Vedic approach to measurement of service quality}}, Services Marketing Quarterly, 31(4), 420–433</ref><ref>Roberto De Nobili, Preaching Wisdom to the Wise: Three Treatises, {{ISBN|978-1880810378}}, p. 132</ref>

''Namaste'' is one of the six forms of [[Pranāma|pranama]], and in parts of India these terms are used synonymously.<ref>R.R.
