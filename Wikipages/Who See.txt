'''Who See''' (also referred to as '''Who See?''' and '''Who See Klapa''') is a [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrin]] hip-hop duo from [[Kotor]]. Its members are '''Dedduh''' or '''Deda''' (Dejan Dedović), from Kotor, and '''Noyz''' (Mario Đorđević), from [[Herceg Novi]]. The group was created in the early 2000s, recording their first demo track titled "Dim po dim" ("''Puff after puff''"). Noyz and Dedduh had guest appearances on Serbian hip-hop compilation "Ulice vol.1", and [[Sve same barabe]], an album by [[43Zla]]. In 2007, the group released their debut album, [[Sviranje kupcu]]. Among the guests on the album there are [[Bad Copy]], [[Škabo]] from [[Beogradski Sindikat]], [[Hornsman Coyote]] from [[Eyesburn]] and Rhino, a producer and MC from [[Podgorica]]. He authored some of the beats on the album and was the executive producer on all the tracks.

Who See also collaborated with various artists, recording tracks with [[Sean Price]], [[Ajs Nigrutin]], [[Wikluh Sky]], Prti Bee Gee, Krešo Bengalka, Kid Rađa, [[Frenkie]], Random, Smoke Mardeljano, Kendi and Labia.

== Performance at Refresh Festival 2008 ==

Who See Klapa had the honour to perform as the opening act of Kotor's [[Refresh Festival 2008|2008 Refresh Festival]]'s hip-hop category on opening day, 7 August. They opened at the hip-hop stage at the Maximus discothèque, their appearance scheduled for 00:00 (Midnight) local time. Their performance proved that it is not instant success that they have attained even outside of Montenegro's border. Their performance also successfully paved for their colleague, Serbian rapper [[Marčelo]]'s, performance, which was due an hour after Who See?'s performance.<ref>[[Refresh Festival 2008]]: [http://www.refreshfestival.com/?p=122 Počeo drugi Refresh Festival], 8 August 2008</ref>

== Solo works ==
In their free time, Dedduh and Noyz have worked on their own solo works. Dedduh recorded a single called "''Kakav ćemo refren?''" ("''What kind of chorus [do we want]?''), featuring Serbian rapper Ajs Nigrutin. Meanwhile, Noyz recorded "''Niđe hedova masnija''", featuring Ajs Nigrutin and Timbe.
