'''My Morning Jacket''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Louisville, Kentucky]] in 1998. The band consists of vocalist/guitarist [[Jim James]], bassist [[Tom Blankenship]], drummer [[Patrick Hallahan]], guitarist [[Carl Broemel]], and keyboardist [[Bo Koster]].<ref>Perry, Johnathan. [http://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2006/12/04/my_morning_jacket_turns_up_heat/ My Morning Jacket Turns up the Heat]. ''The Boston Globe''. December 4, 2006.</ref> The band's sound, rooted in rock and country, is often experimental and psychedelic. The group amassed a following beginning in the 2000s in part due to their live performances.

The group first found success in Europe after the release of its debut album, ''[[The Tennessee Fire]]'' (1999). Its next release, ''[[At Dawn]]'' (2001), led to a large stateside following and preceded several lineup changes. After signing to major label [[ATO Records]], the group released two albums, ''[[It Still Moves]]'' (2003) and ''[[Z (My Morning Jacket album)|Z]]'' (2005), with the latter representing a critical breakthrough. The group's next release, ''[[Evil Urges]]'' (2008), was more polarizing for fans and critics, while ''[[Circuital]]'' (2011), its sixth album, saw a more measured response. After many years of side projects and touring, the band's seventh album, ''[[The Waterfall (album)|The Waterfall]]'', was released in 2015, followed by ''[[The Waterfall II]]'' in 2020.

==History==

===Formation and debut releases (1998–2000)===
My Morning Jacket was formed in Louisville, Kentucky in 1998 by singer-songwriter [[Jim James]]. James created the group as an outlet for acoustic songs he had developed on his own that his band at the time, Month of Sundays, could not use.<ref name="p4k02">{{cite news|title=Interviews: My Morning Jacket|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/5868-my-morning-jacket/|date=August 1, 2002|access-date=October 21, 2015|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|author= William Bowers}}</ref> The group's first lineup included his cousin, Johnny Quaid (guitar), Tom Blankenship (bass), and J. Glenn on drums, all formerly of [[Shelbyville, Kentucky|Shelbyville]]-based [[emo|emo-punk]] band Winter Death Club.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}} The band's name stems from James, who once found a discarded coat with the emblazoned letters MMJ.<ref name="p15">{{cite news|title=My Morning Jacket: Renewal from The Waterfall|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/05/my-morning-jacket-renewal-from-the-waterfall-1.html|date=May 5, 2015|access-date=October 21, 2015|work=[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]|author= Ryan Reed}}</ref>

The band's debut album, ''[[The Tennessee Fire]]'', was released in May 1999. It was mildly successful in the U.S., though it became a surprise hit internationally, particularly in the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. Soon, the group launched a European tour, where it received high marks from Dutch and Belgian press; the group also appeared in the Dutch documentary, ''This is NOT America''. Danny Cash joined the band as keyboardist in 2000.<ref name="AM"/>

===Early years and breakthrough (2001–2007)===
The band's second effort, ''[[At Dawn]]'' (2001), helped grow the group's fanbase in its home country. For the album, James recorded his vocals in a grain silo, creating a sound heavy on echo that became a hallmark of the band's early releases. Subsequently, drummer J. Glenn left the band, and was briefly replaced by Chris Guetig.<ref name="RS">{{cite magazine|title=My Morning Jacket: Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/my-morning-jacket/biography|access-date=October 21, 2015|magazine=Rolling Stone}}</ref> Patrick Hallahan, James' childhood best friend, replaced Guetig.<ref name="AM">{{cite web|title=My Morning Jacket: Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/my-morning-jacket-mn0000520583/biography|access-date=October 21, 2015|website=[[Allmusic]]|author= Andrew Leahey}}</ref> In the early 2000s, the band toured heavily, often supporting bands such as [[Guided by Voices]], [[Doves (band)|Doves]], and [[Foo Fighters]].<ref name="AM"/> The group signed to independent label [[ATO Records]] in 2002 ahead of its third album, ''[[It Still Moves]]'', which saw release in September 2003 to wide acclaim. In January 2004, Cash and Quaid announced their departure from the group; they were replaced by keyboardist Bo Koster and guitarist Carl Broemel.<ref name="AM"/>

''[[Z (My Morning Jacket album)|Z]]'', released in 2005, became the group's breakthrough album.<ref name="p15"/> It received positive critical reviews; in his review for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', critic [[David Fricke]] wrote, "America is a lot closer to getting its own [[Radiohead]], and it isn't [[Wilco]]".<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/z-204749/|title=Z|last=Fricke|first=David|date=2005-10-20|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-03-02}}</ref> The album was noticeable for a break from James' heavily [[reverb]]ed vocals, and featured experimentation with dub, [[reggae]] and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref name="RS"/> ''[[Okonokos]]'', a live album captured while the band toured ''Z'', was released in 2006.

===Shift in sound (2008–2013)===
The band's next release, ''[[Evil Urges]]'', marked a considerable shift in their sound, and it received polarizing reactions from fans and critics. Many songs on the album developed on 90-minute walks James would embark on in Louisville. Its lyrics centered on a relationship that fell apart shortly before recording.<ref name="rs08"/> To promote the album, the band appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The band toured in support of the record that summer, which included a storied appearance at [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in [[Manchester, Tennessee]]. The band, beginning at midnight, performed for four hours in the rain. Unfazed by a torrential downpour for much of its first half, the band's set went on to feature thirty-five songs, including all but two tracks from ''Evil Urges'' and numerous covers, and featured a guest appearance from [[Kirk Hammett]] of [[Metallica]]. The set has commonly been regarded among the band's personal best and one of the best in the history of the festival. ''Rolling Stone'' called it "career-defining."<ref name="rs08"/> ''Evil Urges'' was nominated for a [[Grammy]] for Best [[Alternative Rock]] Album. My Morning Jacket performed before a sold-out crowd at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York. The band members appeared as themselves in the ''[[American Dad!]]'' episode, "[[My Morning Straitjacket]]", which aired on November 22, 2009.

In 2010, My Morning Jacket took up residency at New York's Terminal 5 on October 18, 19, 21, 22 and 23, performing one of its five studio releases each night along with additional material from the relevant period.<ref>Greenblatt, Jeffrey [http://www.glidemagazine.com/hiddentrack/mmj-to-play-5-nights-at-terminal-5/ "MMJ To Play 5 Nights At Terminal 5"] ''Hidden Track (Glide Magazine)'' – June 9, 2010</ref> According to the September 16, 2010 issue of ''Rolling Stone'', My Morning Jacket has started working on its next LP. "We've got five songs done," says front man Jim James. "It'll probably be out next spring." James is co-producing the record with [[The Decemberists]] collaborator [[Tucker Martine]] in an old church in My Morning Jacket's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. "We're trying to do everything but the strings live," says James. "There's something old and dirty-sounding about it." The band's sixth album ''[[Circuital]]'' was released on May 31, 2011. The band toured for two years in support of ''Circuital''. In 2013, it embarked on a tour alongside [[Wilco]] and [[Bob Dylan]] that left band members disappointed, as they had falsely been told Dylan desired to work with them.<ref name="rs"/>

===Recent events (2014–present)===
While the band took a break, James stayed busy, touring behind his solo album, ''[[Regions of Light and Sound of God]]'', and collaborating with [[Elvis Costello]] and [[Marcus Mumford]] for [[the New Basement Tapes]] project. These individual side projects, rather than detach the musicians, worked to strengthen band members' skill as musicians, according to Blankenship. This led to a greater appreciation of the group upon their return to it.<ref>{{cite news|title=My Morning Jacket's Tom Blakenship Talks ''The Waterfall'' (Interview)|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/134510/morning-jackets-tom-blankenship-talks-waterfall-interview/|author= Neil Ferguson |date=April 28, 2015|work=Glide|access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> The band's next album, ''[[The Waterfall (album)|The Waterfall]]'', was mainly recorded at a hilltop mansion above [[Stinson Beach, California|Stinson Beach]] in  [[Marin County, California]].<ref name="rs1"/> The band felt the surroundings were "slightly supernatural,"<ref name="wsj">{{cite news|title=Jim James on Finding the Heart of My Morning Jacket's New Album 'The Waterfall'|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2015/05/04/jim-james-my-morning-jacket-the-waterfall-interview/|author=Mike Ayers|date=May 4, 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> which produced a largely idyllic recording process.<ref name="rs">{{cite news|title=Remaking My Morning Jacket: Behind Dark New 'The Waterfall'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/remaking-my-morning-jacket-behind-dark-new-the-waterfall-20150423|author=Patrick Doyle|date=April 23, 2015|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=June 10, 2015}}</ref> ''The Waterfall'' was released in May 2015, debuting number 11 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the U.S., with 33,000 copies sold in its first week.<ref name="bb">{{cite news|title=Muse Leads Alternative Songs, Breaking Benjamin Returns|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6568331/muse-alternative-songs-breaking-benjamin-returns|author= Emily White |date=May 15, 2015|work=Billboard|access-date=June 11, 2015}}</ref> In December 2015, ''The Waterfall'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards Nominees|url = http://www.grammy.com/nominees?genre=1|website = The GRAMMYs|access-date = February 8, 2016}}</ref>
