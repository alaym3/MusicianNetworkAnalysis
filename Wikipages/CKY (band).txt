'''CKY''' (abbreviation of the band's original name '''Camp Kill Yourself''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[West Chester, Pennsylvania]]. Formed in 1998 by vocalist and guitarist [[Deron Miller]], guitarist [[Chad I Ginsburg]] and drummer [[Jess Margera]], the group currently features Margera and Ginsburg with touring bassist Chris Weyh. CKY found initial recognition through its contributions to the ''[[CKY (video series)|CKY]]'' video series and ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]'' TV series, both of which featured Margera's brother [[Bam Margera|Bam]].

After releasing its debut album ''[[Volume 1 (CKY album)|Volume 1]]'' in 1999, CKY signed with [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island/Def Jam]] and issued ''[[Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild]]'' in 2002, which gave the band its first experience of US chart success. In 2005 the album ''[[An Answer Can Be Found]]'' followed, after which the group signed with [[Roadrunner Records]] and released ''[[Carver City]]'' in 2009. Miller left the band in 2011, after which Ginsburg, Margera and bassist [[Matt Deis]] released ''[[The Phoenix (CKY album)|The Phoenix]]'' on [[Entertainment One Music]] in 2017.

CKY has been categorized in genres including [[post-grunge]], [[hard rock]], [[stoner rock]] and [[skate punk]]. The band's songwriting in the past was typically led by Miller, with production, engineering and mixing handled by Ginsburg. Since Miller's departure in 2011, Ginsburg has taken over as frontman. Miller has since reformed pre-CKY group [[Foreign Objects (band)|Foreign Objects]] (which originally included Margera) and founded [[96 Bitter Beings]], his own continuance of the material he previously played with CKY.

[[File:DERONMILLER_LIVE0709.jpg|thumb|left|CKY's founding frontman [[Deron Miller]] wrote the majority of the band's lyrics and music during his tenure.]]
A number of music critics have stated that it as difficult to categorize CKY into a specific musical genre. The band is listed by music website [[AllMusic]] in the [[post-grunge]], [[hard rock]], [[stoner rock]] and [[skate punk]] genre.<ref name="allmusic"/> Due to the band's association with professional skateboarding (owed mainly to its link with [[Bam Margera]]), its music has been dubbed as [[skate punk]],<ref name="bretlove">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cky-vol-1-mw0000089468 |title=CKY, Vol. 1 - CKY |last=Love |first=Bret |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=August 13, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="kendallshields">{{cite magazine |url=http://exclaim.ca/Music/article/cky-answer_can_be_found |title=CKY An Answer Can Be Found |last=Shields |first=Kendall |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |date=July 1, 2005 |access-date=August 13, 2015 }}</ref> but it is suggested by AllMusic's Greg Prato that this label was extinguished upon the release of ''Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild'', which features a "heavy alt-metal sound".<ref name="allmusic"/> The group's sound has been described as stoner metal by ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s Jenny Eliscu.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cky-frontman-slams-rolling-stone-journalist-over-cd-review/ |title=CKY Frontman Slams Rolling Stone Journalist Over CD Review |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=July 9, 2005 |access-date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> Writers at both [[Blabbermouth.net]] and the [[Ultimate Guitar Archive]] have described CKY as "genre-defying",<ref name="roadrunnerblabbermouth"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/reviews/compact_discs/cky/carver_city |title=Carver City Review - CKY |last=Sciarretto |first=Amy |publisher=[[Ultimate Guitar Archive]] |date=May 19, 2009 |access-date=August 13, 2015 }}</ref> while [[PopMatters]] reviewer Nikki Tranter described the sound on ''Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild'' as "impossible to label".<ref name="tranter">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/cky-infiltrate/ |title=CKY: Infiltrate.Destroy.Rebuild |last=Tranter |first=Nikki |magazine=[[PopMatters]] |date=November 5, 2002 |access-date=August 13, 2015 }}</ref>

CKY's songs have featured references to a number of different lyrical themes. On ''Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild'', it is proposed by Tranter that a number of tracks are written about "the decaying state of humanity" and "the need for some kind of freedom", with the writer describing the lyrics as "relentlessly dark, yet beautifully written, observant and real".<ref name="tranter"/> On ''An Answer Can Be Found'', there are multiple songs said to be renouncing the idea of suicide.<ref name="rollingstone"/> The band has also written songs as part of ongoing storylines on a number of occasions – "[[96 Quite Bitter Beings]]", "Escape from Hellview" and "[[Hellions on Parade]]" (as well as an early demo called "Thanks for the Ride")<ref name="craveonline">{{cite web |url=http://www.craveonline.com/music/145418-interview-with-deron-miller-of-cky |title=Interview with Deron Miller of CKY |last=Robinson |first=Iann |publisher=[[CraveOnline]] |date=June 22, 2009 |access-date=August 13, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923230655/http://www.craveonline.com/music/145418-interview-with-deron-miller-of-cky |archive-date=September 23, 2015 }}</ref> make up a series of songs about a fictional town called Hellview, the residents of which "doesn't take kindly to outsiders", and the songs on ''Carver City'' tell a story of a town named after a fisherman, who killed his crew and later returns to "curse the city".<ref name="hellions">{{cite web |url=http://noisecreep.com/ckys-deron-miller-talks-hellions-on-parade-band-troubles-an/ |title=CKY's Deron Miller Talks 'Hellions on Parade,' Band Troubles, and New Album |last=Reilly |first=Dan |website=[[Noisecreep]] |date=May 4, 2009 |access-date=August 13, 2015 }}</ref>

==Fanbase and critical reception==
The fanbase of CKY is affectionately dubbed the CKY Alliance, and has been identified as particularly passionate about the band.<ref name="rollingstone"/> Miller has proposed that the Alliance is "almost more important than the band", praising them as instrumental in the band's success.<ref name="craveonline"/> Following the release of ''Infiltrate•Destroy•Rebuild'', members of the Alliance "bombarded" ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine with "pissed-off e-mails" after it awarded the album two out of five stars in a negative review.<ref name="rollingstone"/> After they followed this with another poor review of ''An Answer Can Be Found'', Miller responded to writer Jenny Eliscu, mocking her as "an aging, ugly skank" and mocking ''Rolling Stone'' themselves as "predictable, tiresome and unprofessional" to have even employed her.<ref>{{cite web |title=CKY Frontman Slams ROLLING STONE Journalist Over CD Review |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cky-frontman-slams-rolling-stone-journalist-over-cd-review/ |website=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |access-date=February 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418230545/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cky-frontman-slams-rolling-stone-journalist-over-cd-review/ |archive-date=April 18, 2018 |date=July 9, 2005}}</ref> The band's fans followed by waging a "harassment campaign" against her, which included phoning and emailing her with death threats.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/cky-fans-wage-harassment-campaign-against-rolling-stone-critic/ |title=CKY Fans Wage 'Harassment Campaign' Against Rolling Stone Critic |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |date=August 12, 2005 |access-date=August 13, 2015 }}</ref>

In reviews of its albums, CKY has received praise from various music critics.
