'''dälek''' (pronounced 'Die-a-leck') is an American [[experimental hip hop]] group formed in [[Newark, New Jersey]] in 1998. The group's current lineup consists of MC dälek (vocals and producer) and Mike Manteca  (aka Mike Mare) (electronics and producer).

==History==
The group originated in the New Jersey DIY scene of the mid-1990s, based around a studio lineup of Dälek (Will Brooks), Oktopus (Alap Momin), and Joshua Booth.

The group recorded and played live with several DJs, including DJ rEk on from 1998 to 2002, from 2002 and 2005 with still (Hsi-Chang Lin), and from 2006 to 2009 with Motiv. With this core, the group released four full-length LPs on [[Ipecac Recordings]], and a string of EPs, singles and remixes on various [[independent label]]s.

Booth left the group to complete his doctorate in 2009, and Oktopus had relocated to Berlin by 2010.<ref name=vice>{{cite web | url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/dalek-video-interview | first=Anthony | last=Bartkewicz | title=The Return of Pioneering Noise-Rap Outliers Dälek: "I Missed the Noise" | date=April 4, 2015 | access-date=March 3, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122115825/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/dalek-video-interview | archive-date=November 22, 2015 | url-status=live }}</ref> Dälek released a single LP, ''Untitled'', with Brooks and Momin as the sole members, in 2011. From 2011 to 2015, the group was on permanent hiatus.

In 2015, Brooks reunited with DJ rEk and Dälek collaborator Mike Manteca (Destructo Swarmbots). In 2016, the group released a full-length LP ''[[Asphalt for Eden]]'' on Profound Lore Records.<ref name=ATTN>{{cite web | url=http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/features/9750 | first=Jack | last=Chuter | title=Interview: Dälek | date=April 1, 2016 | access-date=April 11, 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425210155/http://www.attnmagazine.co.uk/features/9750 | archive-date=April 25, 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>

In December 2016, Ipecac Recordings announced that they had re-signed Dälek.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dälek Announces 2017 Album on Ipecac Recordings|url=https://deadverse.com/2016/12/dalek-announces-2017-album-ipecac-recordings/|website=Deadverse Recordings|access-date=28 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170928193346/https://deadverse.com/2016/12/dalek-announces-2017-album-ipecac-recordings/|archive-date=28 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Their most recent album, ''Endangered Philosophies'', was released in August 2017.

==Style and influence==
Dälek's music is dark, noisy and atmospheric, equally inspired by industrial music like [[Einstürzende Neubauten]], the layered noise of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and the dense sound collages of [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]. Their sound is often constructed through sampling and a musical base atypical of most hip hop, making it difficult for people to classify their sound. They have been described as [[trip hop]], [[glitch hop]], [[metal (music)|metal]], [[shoegaze]], and [[hip hop]], as well as being criticized for their broad range of sound.<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times Review">{{Cite news

MC dälek described the duo's music to the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'':<ref name="Chicago Sun-Times Review" />

{{Cquote|"It's purely hip-hop, in the purest sense. If you listen to what hip-hop has historically been, it was all about digging in different crates and finding different sounds, and finding different influences to create. If [[Afrika Bambaataa]] wasn't influenced by [[Kraftwerk]], we wouldn't have '[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]].' So, in that sense, what we do is strictly hip-hop.}}

{{Cquote|If there is a difference. It's that the palette of sounds we work with is more varied than what has been called hip-hop in the last 10 years. Somehow, as hip-hop grew, it's been put into this box. I think it's funny when people are like, 'That's not hip-hop. It's this and this and this.' You can try to rationalize it as whatever you want to rationalize it as."}}
