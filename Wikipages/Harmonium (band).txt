'''Harmonium''' was a [[Quebec]] [[progressive rock]] band formed in 1972 in [[Montreal]].<ref name="AllMusic Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/harmonium-mn0000664863/biography|title=Harmonium <nowiki>|</nowiki> Biography & History|first=François|last=Couture|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=5 September 2016}}</ref>

==History==
Lead vocalist and guitarist Serge Fiori met Michel Normandeau (vocals and guitar) in a theatre music meeting in November 1972. Later on, in 1973, they met bassist Louis Valois and formed Harmonium.<ref name="AllMusic Bio"/> In November 1973, the group performed their first air play on [[CHOM-FM]]. They played 3 tracks: ''Pour un instant'', ''Un musicien parmi tant d'autres'', and ''Un refrain parmi tant d'autres''.<ref name="Harmonium at CHOM">{{cite web|url=http://www.chom.com/blog/terry-dimonte/2012/04/10/harmonium-in-the-chom-studio-in-1973|title=Harmonium in the CHOM studio in 1973|first=Terry|last=DiMonte|publisher=[[CHOM-FM]]|date=4 October 2012|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref> The first 2 songs were later recorded professionally to be put on their self-titled debut [[Harmonium (Harmonium album)|album]]. The last song was a [[sequel]] to ''Un musicien parmi tant d'autres'', but never made the album cut, staying unreleased. A single was also released at the time with the hit ''[[Pour un instant]]'' on side A and ''100,000 Raisons'' on side B, the latter only included on the CD version of the album nearly 20 years later. This album was a huge success and a sold out tour was staged all over Quebec and in French Canada.

Their second album ''[[Si on avait besoin d'une cinquième saison]]'', better known as ''Les Cinq saisons'', was an immediate success. This concept album included five songs, each one representing a season with the last song being a long instrumental representing a fifth and imaginary season. For this album, the band recruited two new members, Pierre Daigneault, playing the [[flute]]s, [[Saxophone|sax]], and [[clarinet]]s and Serge Locat, handling the [[piano]] and [[synthesizer]]. The group also invited two guests to play on the sessions: [[Judi Richards]], who handles the vocalizations on the instrumental "Histoires sans paroles" and Marie Bernard performing the [[theremin]]-like sounds of the [[ondes Martenot|Martenot waves]]. In 2015, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine listed this album at number 36 of the best 50 [[progressive rock]] album and declared it the best [[progressive folk]] album.<ref name="RS Prog Ratings">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-greatest-prog-rock-albums-of-all-time-20150617/harmonium-si-on-avait-besoin-dune-cinquieme-1975-20150617|title=50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time|first=Ryan|last=Reed|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=17 June 2015|accessdate=6 September 2016}}</ref>

Finally, the double album ''[[L'Heptade]]'', was released in 1976 after months of recording in Serge Fiori's own house in St-Césaire, Québec. The songs describe seven stages of consciousness in a person's daily life.<ref name="L'Heptade Reissue">{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldemontreal.com/2016/06/26/version-remixee-pour-lheptade|title=Version Remixée Pour L’Heptade|first=Yves|last=Leclerc|date=26 June 2016|accessdate=6 September 2016|publisher=[[Le Journal de Montréal]]|language=French}}</ref> The first and the last songs are named "Comme un fou" and "Comme un sage", indicating a progression towards wisdom; from a fool to a sage.

The group was invited to [[Los Angeles]], where the performance of old and new material was filmed by a team from the [[National Film Board of Canada]] and released as ''Harmonium en Californie'' in October 1979. The new songs were published on the album ''Deux cents nuits à l'heure'', a side-project headed by Serge Fiori and [[Richard Séguin]] under the name Fiori-Séguin in mid-1977. Harmonium's last concert is said to have taken place at the Centre de la Nature in [[Laval, Quebec]], in late 1978. ''[[Harmonium en tournée]]'', a live version of ''L'Heptade'' recorded in [[Vancouver]] in 1977, was released in 1980.

In 2007, all three of Harmonium's studio albums were named among the 100 greatest Canadian albums of all time in [[Bob Mersereau]]'s book ''[[The Top 100 Canadian Albums]]''. They were the only francophone albums from Quebec named to the list besides [[Jean-Pierre Ferland]]'s ''[[Jaune (album)|Jaune]]''.<ref name="Top Canadian albums">{{cite book|title=The Top 100 Canadian Albums|first=Bob|last=Mersereau|publisher=Goose Lane Editions|date=2007|isbn=086492500X|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/top100canadianal0000mers}}</ref>

L'''Heptade XL'', a remixed version of the album, with a few minutes of new recordings, was released on November 18th 2016 to celebrate its fortieth anniversary. The initial mix of l`Heptade was made as the group was touring in the USA. The remastering reflected more closely the vision of Fiori, into fully open music compared to the original studio mix. It was accompanied by the release of an extra song recorded live in 1977, called ''C'est dans le noir'', available on [[iTunes]].<ref name="heptade">{{cite web|url=http://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/arts_et_spectacles/2016/06/27/004-l-heptade-reedition-harmonium.shtml|title=Harmonium lancera une réédition de L'heptade|language=French|date=27 June 2016|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}</ref> This song was recorded at the [[National Arts Centre]] in [[Ottawa]] during the tour for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.journaldequebec.com/2016/09/16/harmonium-lance-une-chanson-inedite|title=Harmonium lance une chanson inédite|language=French|date=16 September 2016|accessdate=5 November 2016|publisher=[[Journal de Québec]]}}</ref> ''Viens voir le paysage'', a film of one of these performances, was also released on DVD for the same occasion.

In 2018, the group were awarded honorary [[Prix Félix]] at the 40th annual Gala de l'ADISQ.<ref>[https://voir.ca/nouvelles/actualite-musicale/2018/03/05/un-hommage-a-harmonium-au-40e-gala-de-ladisq/ "Un hommage à Harmonium au 40e Gala de l’ADISQ"]. ''[[Voir]]'', March 5, 2018.</ref> Despite being one of the most influential bands in Quebec music history, the band never won a Félix as they had broken up by the time the awards were launched.<ref>[https://www.journaldequebec.com/2018/10/26/harmonium-a-ladisq "Harmonium à l’ADISQ"]. ''[[Le Journal de Québec]]'', October 26, 2018.</ref>

A remix from the original 16-track master tapes of the group's first album, titled ''Harmonium XLV'' was released in December 2019 which includes a different take of the hit ''Pour un instant''.  A reissue of ''Si on avait besoin d'une cinquième saison'' is also in the works.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sorstu.ca/entrevue-avec-harmonium-harmonium-xlv-un-classique-sous-un-nouveau-jour/|title=Entrevue avec Harmonium - Harmonium XLV : Un classique sous un nouveau jour|language=French|date=18 October 2019|accessdate=26 December 2019|publisher=Sors-tu.ca}}</ref>

In 2020, Simon Leclerc scored a full orchestral version of the totality of Harmonium's music and recorded it with the [[Montreal Symphony Orchestra]]. The album came as a surprise for Serge Fiori, who called it a masterpiece and maybe the best versions of his music as he stated in an interview at Radio-Canada, that this represented the ultimate evolution of his music that from day one was most likely meant to be played with such orchestral arrangements. "Histoires sans paroles : Harmonium symphonique" is distributed by mail order or download only.
