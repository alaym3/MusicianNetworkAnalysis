'''Insane Clown Posse''', often abbreviated as '''ICP''', is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo. Formed in Detroit in 1989 as a [[gangsta rap]] group, ICP's best known lineup consists of rappers [[Violent J]] (Joseph Bruce) and [[Shaggy 2 Dope]] (originally 2 Dope; Joseph Utsler). Insane Clown Posse is known for its elaborate live performances and theatrical [[horror fiction|horror]]-inspired lyrics full of dark humor. The duo has earned two [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and five gold albums. According to [[Nielsen SoundScan]], the entire catalog of the group has sold 6.5&nbsp;million units in the United States and Canada {{as of|2007|04|lc=yes}}.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/musicNews/idUSN0232707820070402|title=Insane Clowns prosper even as album sales wane|access-date=September 24, 2008|publisher=Reuters/[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=April 2, 2007}}</ref> The group has established a dedicated following called [[Juggalo]]s numbering in the "tens of thousands".<ref name=nyt/>

Originally known as ''JJ Boyz'' and ''Inner City Posse'', the group introduced [[supernatural]]- and horror-themed lyrics as a means of distinguishing itself stylistically. The duo founded the independent record label [[Psychopathic Records]] with Alex Abbiss as manager, and produced and starred in the feature films ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'' and ''[[Big Money Rustlas]]''. They formed their own [[professional wrestling]] promotion, [[Juggalo Championship Wrestling]], and have collaborated with many hip hop and [[rock music|rock]] musicians.

The songs of Insane Clown Posse center thematically on the mythology of the [[Dark Carnival (Insane Clown Posse)|Dark Carnival]], a metaphoric limbo in which the lives of the dead are judged by one of several entities. The Dark Carnival is elaborated through a series of stories called Joker's Cards, each of which offers a specific lesson designed to change the "evil ways" of listeners before "the end consumes us all".

===1985–1994: Early history===
[[Violent J|Joseph Bruce]] (Violent J) and [[Shaggy 2 Dope|Joseph Utsler]] (Shaggy 2 Dope) met in [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]], a suburb on the north border of [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Along with Utsler's brother, John, and friend, Lacy, they wrestled in [[backyard wrestling|backyard rings]] that they had built themselves.<ref name="BehindthePaint51">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/51 51–61] |chapter=JJ Boys and The Royal Oak Township|date=August 2003 }}</ref> They also listened to [[hip hop music]], including [[3rd Bass]], [[Beastie Boys]], [[N.W.A]] and local rappers like Awesome Dre.<ref name="BehindthePaint51"/> In 1989, Joseph Bruce as Jagged Joe, Joseph Utsler as Kangol Joe and John Utsler as Master J, released the single titled "[[Party at the Top of the Hill]]" under the name of JJ Boys, but the group did not pursue a serious career in music.<ref name="BehindthePaint539">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=539–540 |chapter=Complete Discography|date=August 2003 }}</ref> Poverty and a difficult home life drove Bruce to move in with Rudy "The Rude Boy" Hill in [[River Rouge, Michigan|River Rouge]], a city near the industrial southwest side of Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint108">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/108 108–111] |chapter=Rude Boy and the Magical Land of Toxic Waste|date=August 2003 }}</ref>

Feeling a sense of home and belonging, Bruce formed a gang called Inner City Posse, which was composed of Joseph Utsler, Rudy Hill, other friends of Bruce, and a number of other connections he had made in Southwest Detroit.<ref name="BehindthePaint108"/> Bruce was jailed for ninety days in 1989–1990 for death threats, robbery, and violating [[probation]];<ref name="BehindthePaint125">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/125 125–132] |chapter=Intelligence and Violence|date=August 2003 }}</ref> this experience convinced him to reduce his involvement in gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> Bruce began his [[professional wrestling]] career after getting out of jail, and it was at his first show that he met [[Rob Van Dam]] and [[Sabu (wrestler)|Sabu]], two other first-timers with whom he became very good friends.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> During this time Bruce brought Utsler backstage with him, and all four became close friends.

Bruce became frustrated with the backstage politics of the wrestling business and began searching for another career.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/> Back on the streets, Bruce, Utsler and Utsler's brother John performed hip hop music at local night clubs, using the [[stage name]]s Violent&nbsp;J, 2&nbsp;Dope, and John Kickjazz, under the name of their gang, Inner City Posse.<ref name="BehindthePaint539"/> Seeing a need for a manager, Bruce's brother [[Robert Bruce (rapper)|Robert]] recommended his friend and record store owner Alex Abbiss, who established the [[Psychopathic Records]] record label with the group in 1991. Later that year the group released the self-produced [[Extended play|EP]] entitled ''[[Dog Beats]]''.<ref name="AMGHipHop">{{cite book |title=All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap & Hip-hop |year=2003 |isbn=0-87930-759-5 |publisher=Backbeat Books |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879307592/page/229 229–31] |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780879307592/page/229 }}</ref>

Local radio broadcasters were reluctant to play the EP's single, "Dog Beats", because Inner City Posse's members were white.<ref name="BehindthePaint164">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |date=August 2003 |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/164 164–167] |chapter=Paying Dues }}</ref> While trying to get stations to play the single, Bruce learned that one of the stations he and Abbiss visited would be interviewing local rapper [[Esham]], who Bruce considered to be a "superstar"; Bruce had recently begun to collect Esham's albums, as he had done with other local rappers; by the time he had discovered Esham, the rapper had released two full-length albums and three EPs.<ref name="BehindthePaint164"/> Bruce met Esham for the first time at the station and praised him. Esham wished Bruce well and Bruce gave the rapper a copy of ''Dog Beats''; this began the friendship and professional relationship between Psychopathic Records and Esham's label, [[Reel Life Productions]].<ref name="BehindthePaint164"/> Growing popularity in the local music scene turned negative for the group's gang, which became the target of growing violence. After receiving jail sentences, the group members abandoned gang life.<ref name="BehindthePaint125"/>

In late 1991, the group had the problem of having spent more money on production than was covered by returns. The group decided that its [[gangsta rap]] style was the cause: most emcees at the time used similar styles, making it difficult for Inner City Posse to distinguish itself stylistically.<ref name="BehindthePaint174">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/174 174–185] |chapter=The Dark Carnival|date=August 2003 }}</ref> Referring to local rapper [[Esham]]'s [[horrorcore]] style, Bruce suggested the band adapt this genre, in a bid to have Detroit represent acid rap, much as [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] represented gangsta rap. The group agreed, but not to copying the style of Esham closely. Instead, they suggested using horror-themed lyrics as an emotional outlet for all their negative life experiences. They were also unanimous in deciding not to rap openly about [[Satan]], which Esham often did.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

After the change in musical style, the group decided it needed a new name. Utsler suggested keeping the "I.C.P." initials to inform the community that Inner City Posse was not defunct.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> Several names were considered before Bruce recalled his dream of a clown running around in Delray, which became the inspiration for the group's new name: '''Insane Clown Posse'''. The group decided they would all don face paint due to the success of their former clown-painted [[hype man]].<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/> Upon returning home that night, Bruce says he had a dream in which "spirits in a [[traveling carnival]] appeared to him"—an image that would become the basis for the Dark Carnival mythology detailed in the group's Joker's Cards series.<ref name="BehindthePaint174"/>

====1992–1993: ''Carnival of Carnage'' era====
The group began recording their debut album, ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'', with producer Chuck Miller. After recording only three songs for $6,000 with Miller, Alex Abbiss made his first major managerial move by finding another producer, [[Mike E. Clark]].<ref name="BehindthePaint198">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/198 198–208] |chapter=The Broken Path of a Dream|date=August 2003 }}</ref> The group finished recording the album with Clark, who continued to work with them throughout their career. The album featured appearances from local rappers, including Esham and [[Kid Rock]].<ref name="AMGHipHop"/> Just weeks prior to the release of their album, John left the group because he felt that it was "taking up too much of [his] life".<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/> When Bruce and Utsler attempted to call a meeting to talk about the issues, John did not attend.<ref name="BehindthePaint198"/>

''Beverly Kills 50187'' featured Greez-E, a fan that the ICP met earlier that year, as a replacement for John Kickjazz.<ref name="BehindthePaint209">

====1994: ''Ringmaster'' era====
The group's second studio album, ''[[Ringmaster (album)|Ringmaster]]'', was released on March 8, 1994, and its popularity enabled the group to sell out larger nightclubs across Detroit.<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/231 231]–253 |chapter=Ringmaster's Word|date=August 2003 }}</ref> Because Bruce and Utsler made reference to the Detroit-produced soft drink [[Faygo]] in their songs, they "figured it would be cool to have some on stage with [them]".<ref name="Brant"/> During a concert in 1993, Bruce threw an open bottle of Faygo at a row of concertgoers who were giving them [[Finger (gesture)|the finger]].

====1995–1996: ''Riddle Box'' era====
In 1995, Bruce and Utsler attempted to obtain a contract with a major record label. The duo eventually signed a contract with the short-lived [[Jive Records]] sub-label [[Battery Records (dance)|Battery Records]],<ref name="BehindthePaint231"/> which released the group's third studio album, ''[[Riddle Box]]'', on October 10, 1995.<ref name="BehindthePaint552">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J|last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |page=552 |chapter=Complete Discography|date=August 2003 }}</ref> After Battery/Jive Records showed little interest in promoting the album, Insane Clown Posse funded the promotion of ''Riddle Box'' independently.

====1997–1998: ''The Great Milenko'' era====
Manager Alex Abbiss negotiated a contract with the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]-owned label [[Hollywood Records]], which reportedly paid $1&nbsp;million to purchase the Insane Clown Posse contract from Battery/Jive/BMG Records.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430332/19970703/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Point The Finger At Disney |access-date=May 4, 2008 |date=July 3, 1997 |publisher=MTV}}</ref> The group started recording its fourth studio album, ''[[The Great Milenko]]'', in 1996, during which Disney requested that the tracks "The Neden Game", "Under the Moon", and "Boogie Woogie Wu" be removed.

[[Eminem]], then an unknown local emcee, approached Bruce and, according to Bruce, handed him a flyer advertising the release party for the ''[[Slim Shady EP]]''. The flyer read, "Featuring appearances by Esham, Kid Rock, and ICP (maybe)".<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce asked why Eminem was promoting a possible Insane Clown Posse appearance without first contacting the group. Bruce said that Eminem explained, "It says 'maybe.' Maybe you will be there; I don't know. That's why I'm asking you right now. You guys comin' to my release party, or what?"<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce, upset over not being consulted, responded, "Fuck ''no'', I ain't coming to your party. We might have, if you would've asked us first, before putting us on the fuckin' flyer like this."<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce reported that Eminem attacked the group in radio interviews. Bruce and Utsler first responded by referring to Eminem's alter ego as "Slim Anus" on "85 Bucks An Hour" from [[Twiztid]]'s 1997 debut, ''[[Mostasteless]]'', and later in 1999 releasing a parody of Eminem's "[[My Name Is]]" entitled "Slim Anus". Eminem later released a [[Hip hop skit|skit]] on his album [[The Marshall Mathers LP]] depicting the members of Insane Clown Posse having sex with the fictional [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] Ken Kaniff. In the skit, Kaniff asks Shaggy 2 Dope to "say my name." When Shaggy replies "Eminem," Kaniff is angered and leaves. Barbs between Insane Clown Posse and Eminem continued until the feud was ended in 2005 by hip hop group [[D12]] and Psychopathic Records.<ref name="EminemFeudEnd">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1647067/eminem-beef-with-insane-clown-posse-long-over.jhtml |title=Eminem Beef With Insane Clown Posse Long Over |access-date=July 4, 2011 |last=Anderson |first=Kyle |date=September 2, 2010 |publisher=MTV Networks}}</ref><ref name="EminemFeudEnd2">{{cite web |url=http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=wf_060119 |title=Weekly Freekly Number 195 & 1/3rd |author=Joseph Bruce |work=Weekly Freekly Weekly |publisher=Psychopathic Records, Inc |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017012243/http://www.insaneclownposse.com/page.php?page_id=wf_060119 |archive-date=October 17, 2006 |access-date=July 4, 2011}}</ref>

=====The House of Horrors Tour=====

One month after ''ICP's Strangle-Mania Live'', Insane Clown Posse began their second nationwide tour, "The House of Horrors Tour", with Myzery added as one of the opening acts. While searching for the second opening act, Bruce received a telephone call at his home from former House of Krazees members [[Jamie Spaniolo]] and [[Paul Methric]], who told Bruce that the group was officially disbanded and asked to be on the tour.<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Spaniolo and Methric provided a [[Demo (music)|demo tape]] containing three songs: "2nd Hand Smoke", "Diemotherfuckdie", and "How Does It Feel?"<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/> Bruce was extremely impressed, and immediately had a contract drafted with Psychopathic Records for the new group to sign. Bruce, Spaniolo, and Methric agreed on the band name [[Twiztid]]. The House of Horrors Tour thus featured Insane Clown Posse, with opening groups Twiztid, Myzery, and [[Psycho Realm]].<ref name="BehindthePaint353"/>

=====Legal troubles=====

On November 16, 1997, Bruce was arrested on an [[aggravated battery]] charge after allegedly striking an audience member thirty times with his [[microphone]] at a concert in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. Bruce was held for four hours before being released on $5,000 bail.<ref name="MTV-battery">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430327/19971120/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Charged With Battery |access-date=May 4, 2008 |date=November 20, 1997 |publisher=MTV}}</ref> The January 1998 issue of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine ran a four-page cartoon lampooning Insane Clown Posse and Juggalos, claiming that the group was offensive "not for their obscenity, but for their stupidity". ''Spin'' likened Insane Clown Posse's stage act to "a sort of circus [[karaoke]]" and portrayed the group's fans as overweight suburbanites. On the group's website, Bruce responded to the article by stating, "I could give a fuck less".<ref name="MTV-Spin">{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430325/19980107/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clowns Swing At "Spin" As Tour Nears |access-date=May 4, 2008 |date=January 7, 1998 |publisher=MTV }}</ref>

After a show in [[Indianapolis]], Insane Clown Posse's tour bus stopped at a [[Waffle House]] in [[Greenfield, Indiana|Greenfield]], Indiana.

By late 1998 over one million copies of ''The Great Milenko'' had been sold,<ref name="BehindthePaint414">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/414 414]–433 |chapter=Big Money Hustlas|date=August 2003 }}</ref> and Insane Clown Posse was ready for its fifth album, ''[[The Amazing Jeckel Brothers]]''. Working with Mike E. Clark and Rich "[[Legz Diamond]]" Murrell, Bruce and Utsler developed their album with the highest of hopes. The group was known nationally, but were not taken very seriously. Hoping to receive the respect Bruce and Utsler felt they deserved, they planned to feature well-known, respected rappers on their album.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce stated outright that he wanted to involve [[Snoop Dogg]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]]. They paid Snoop Dogg $40,000 to appear on the song "The Shaggy Show". Snoop Dogg also helped them contact Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was paid $30,000 for his appearance. Ol' Dirty Bastard recorded his track in a matter of two days; however, his recording consisted of nothing more than him rambling about "bitches".<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> It took Bruce and Utsler a week to assemble just four rhymes out of his rambling, and had to re-record the track and title it "Bitches".<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Finally, Insane Clown Posse contacted [[Ice-T]], who charged them only $10,000.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group felt that Ice-T's song did not belong on the album, and was instead released on a later album, ''[[Psychopathics from Outer Space]]''.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

To help increase their positive publicity, the group hired the Nasty Little Man publicity team.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The team set up a photo shoot for Insane Clown Posse that was to appear on the cover of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' magazine in Cleveland. On the set of the photo shoot, a member of the publicity team approached Bruce and explained that in the song "Fuck the World", the lyric that stated "Fuck the Beastie Boys and the [[Dalai Lama]]" needed to be changed.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insulted, Bruce exclaimed that his music would not be censored again—referring to Disney's previous requirement for censorship.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Nasty Little Man told Bruce that the Beastie Boys were not only clients of the company but also personal friends, and the Beastie Boys told the company to make Bruce change the lyric.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> In response, Bruce fired Nasty Little Man and asked its team to leave the photo shoot.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/>

''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' was released on May 25, 1999, and reached No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' album charts,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430318/19990603/i_c_p.jhtml |title=Insane Clown Posse Makes "Amazing" Top Five Debut |access-date=May 4, 2008 |date=June 3, 1999 |publisher=MTV}}</ref> and has since been certified platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref name=RIAA/> Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a "four out of five stars" rating, stating that "[Insane Clown Posse] actually delivered an album that comes close to fulfilling whatever promise their ridiculous, carnivalesque blend of [[Hardcore hip hop|hardcore hip-hop]] and [[Shock rock|shock-metal]] had in the first place".<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r415252|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review of ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' |access-date=May 8, 2008 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> ''Rolling Stone'' writer Barry Walters gave the album a "two out of five stars" rating, writing that "no musical sleight of hand can disguise the fact that Shaggy and J remain the ultimate wack MCs".<ref name="RSJeckelBros">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/insaneclownposse/albums/album/120991/review/6068329/the_amazing_jeckel_brothers |title=Insane Clown Posse: The Amazing Jeckel Brothers: Music Reviews |access-date=December 26, 2007 |first=Barry |last=Walters |year=1999 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071223012603/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/insaneclownposse/albums/album/120991/review/6068329/the_amazing_jeckel_brothers |archive-date = December 23, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> At the same time as ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers{{'}}'' release, Island Records merged with [[Def Jam Records]].

=====''Big Money Hustlas''=====

On Insane Clown Posse's previous tour (The House of Horrors Tour), they had watched the movie ''Big Ballers''.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The group, as well as Twiztid, loved the video. After Insane Clown Posse finished its ''The Amazing Jeckel Brothers'' album, Bruce and Utsler decided to create their own movie, ''[[Big Money Hustlas]]'', with the same low-budget comedy style as ''Big Ballers''. Island Records gave them $250,000 to begin work on the movie.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce and Utsler were contacted by [[John Cafiero]], who said that he was a fan of Insane Clown Posse, and offered to direct the movie.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Insane Clown Posse asked Mick Foley to appear in the movie as "Cactus Sac", a parody of his "Cactus Jack" persona. Cafiero retained the [[Misfits (band)|Misfits]], [[Fred Berry]], and, at Bruce's request, [[Harland Williams]].<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> The script was written by Bruce, and filmed in New York City.<ref name="BehindthePaint414"/> Bruce played a crime boss and Utsler portrayed a police detective.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg&sql=1:210371 |title=Overview for ''Big Money Hustlas'' |access-date=July 16, 2008 |first=Mark |last=Deming |website=[[Allmovie]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060426195934/http://www.allmovie.com/cg/avg.dll?p=avg |archive-date=April 26, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bigmoneyhustlas.com/synop.html |title=Synopsis for ''Big Money Hustlas'' |access-date=July 16, 2008 |publisher=[[Psychopathic Records]] }}</ref> The stage crew members, who showed their dislike for Insane Clown Posse, were a source of contention.

===== Woodstock '99 =====
While on "The Asylum In-store Tour", Bruce and Utsler were informed by Abbiss that they were offered $100,000 to perform at [[Woodstock '99]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444">{{cite book |last1=Bruce |first1=Joseph |author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol |url-access=registration |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/444 444–455] |chapter=Buried Alive |date=August 2003 }}</ref> They were excited about the offer, as it indicated their impact on the music industry. Some people perceived participating in Woodstock '99 was a [[selling out|sell-out]] for the group; however, Bruce and Utsler disagreed. As Bruce explains, "[Woodstock] sold out the mainstream style for us! Woodstock never came to us and asked us to change one fuckin' thing about us or our show! They wanted ICP just as ICP is, and nothing else. If that ain't fresh, then I don't know what the fuck is!".<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

=====Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour troubles=====

After Woodstock 1999, Insane Clown Posse began its "Amazing Jeckel Brothers Tour", along with musicians [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]], [[Krayzie Bone]], Twiztid, [[Mindless Self Indulgence]], and [[Coal Chamber]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Biohazard, Mindless Self Indulgence, Krayzie Bone, and Twiztid were well received by audiences;<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> however, Coal Chamber was not. Insane Clown Posse fans were not purchasing tickets, as they did not like Coal Chamber.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> For the three shows that Coal Chamber played, there were multiple ticket refunds.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and his brother, Rob, made the decision to eliminate Coal Chamber from the tour. After doing so, there were no tickets returned for the remainder of the tour dates.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler claimed that Coal Chamber had been removed from the tour because of equipment problems, but later revealed the true reason for their actions on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', which aired August 19, 1999.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce continued by saying, "Nobody will tell you that, because everybody's afraid of your crumpet-ass bitch manager".<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Later that night, [[Howard Stern|Stern]] contacted Bruce and Utsler, asking them to appear on his show the following day to talk with Coal Chamber's manager, [[Sharon Osbourne]].<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

Before the show went on air, Osbourne bet Bruce and Utsler $50,000 that Insane Clown Posse's next album would not even sell 200,000 copies—a bet that Bruce accepted.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> On air Osbourne informed Bruce and Utsler that Coal Chamber filed a lawsuit for [[breach of contract]].<ref name="SternOsbourne">{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924396/insane_clown_posse_and_sharon_osbourne_battle_on_howard_stern_radio_show |title=Insane Clown Posse and Sharon Osbourne Battle on Howard Stern Radio Show |access-date=December 26, 2007 |last=Fischer |first=Blair R |date=August 20, 1999 |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080112093429/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5924396/insane_clown_posse_and_sharon_osbourne_battle_on_howard_stern_radio_show |archive-date = January 12, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> Osbourne stated that her group was to receive $12,500 per show for a scheduled two-month package tour.

====2013–2014: Continued legal troubles====
Insane Clown Posse sued the [[FBI]], whose [[National Gang Intelligence Center]] listed Juggalos as "a loosely organized hybrid gang" in a 2011 report. The report states that Juggalos are "recognized as a gang in only four states... law enforcement officials in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets". The report also noted that [[New Mexico]] was seeing a lot of Juggalo gang expansion due to their attraction to "the tribal and cultural traditions of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]".<ref name=fbi>{{cite web|title=2011 National Gang Threat Assessment – Emerging Trends|url=https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/2011-national-gang-threat-assessment|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation}}</ref> The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order "to ensure the [[Freedom of assembly|right]] of Juggalos everywhere to gather together and express their support of the I.C.P. without having to worry about being unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement".<ref name=nyt/> On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any "criminal intelligence information" about Juggalos destroyed.<ref name="fbi lawsuit 2">{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=Insane Clown Posse Defends Fans, With F.B.I.

After no word was heard on the album, it was speculated that it had been scrapped. In mid 2013 it was announced that ICP would be releasing their first ever box set titled ''[[The First Six]]''. After the release date came and passed, ''[[The First Six]]'' was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked if we would be able to get the box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put ''[[House of Wax (EP)|House of Wax]]'' in the box set instead. ''[[The First Six]]'' was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.

Additionally, Psychopathic Records is pushing back against a former [[publicist]] who is suing the label for [[sexual harassment]].<ref name=nyt>{{cite news|last=Itzkoff|first=Dave|title=Crisis for Insane Clown Posse: Getting Saner|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/arts/music/crisis-for-insane-clown-posse-getting-saner.html?pagewanted=all|access-date=December 12, 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 8, 2013}}</ref> In late 2013 ICP teamed up with [[Da Mafia 6ix]] to create The Killjoy Club, and released their debut album [[Reindeer Games (TKC album)|Reindeer Games]] on September 2, 2014. ICP went on "The ShockFest Tour" with [[Da Mafia 6ix]], [[Mushroomhead]], [[Madchild]] and [[JellyRoll|Jelly Roll]], additionally Big Hoodoo joined the tour to perform before the ticketed acts. To close out the shows on the tour Insane Clown Posse and [[Da Mafia 6ix]] performed on stage together as The Killjoy Club, doing only two songs.

====2015–2017: ''The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost''/''Found'' era====
During their 2014 Hallowicked concert, ICP revealed the 3rd Joker Card in the 2nd Deck of the Dark Carnival saga. The first part of the third card is titled ''[[The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost]]'', which was released on [[Violent J]]'s 43rd birthday, April 28, 2015. The second part of the third card is titled ''[[The Marvelous Missing Link: Found]]'', and was originally set to be released during the 2015 Gathering of the Juggalos, July 28, 2015. It was released three days later.

On December 5, 2015, [[Violent J]] announced that original member [[John Kickjazz]] ([[Shaggy 2 Dope]]'s older brother) had died on November 20, 2015 at a group home in Michigan.

Young Wicked of the [[Axe Murder Boyz]] posted on his personal Instagram account that ''The Marvelous Missing Link'' was one of the Insane Clown Posse's best albums ever. He stated specifically that it was going back to the Insane Clown Posse's roots in the era of the first deck of Jokers Cards. Young wicked also made a statement that referenced the idea that he may have some featured spots on one of the albums.

On April 7, 2015, ''The Marvelous Missing Link: Lost'' was made available for digital download preorder. Those who preordered on that day received the first single off the album, titled "Vomit". The rest of the album automatically downloaded on the release date, April 28, 2015.

Michigan-based author Steve Miller wrote a book, ''[[Juggalo: Insane Clown Posse, Their Fans, and the World They Made]]''; released in 2016 via [[Da Capo Press]], the book details the fandom associated with juggalos and their struggle with the FBI.

In late 2015 2 flyers were released with the ''Phantom: X-tra Spooky Edition'', promoting 2016 solo album releases from [[Violent J]] titled, ''Karma Forest'', and [[Shaggy 2 Dope]] titled, ''F.T.F.O.M.F.''. On December 10, 2015 it was announced that the sideshow EP for ''The Marvelous Missing Link'' albums was released titled ''Phantom: X-tra Spooky Edition''.

In an April 8, 2016 faygoluvers.net interview with [[Violent J]], he stated that [[Shaggy 2 Dope]] has been working with [[Axe Murder Boyz|Young Wicked]], who also produced the album, without asking [[Violent J]] for any help this far. After an internal conflict between [[Axe Murder Boyz|Young Wicked]], [[Violent J]] and [[Robert Bruce (rapper)|Jumpsteady]], it was rumoured that [[Axe Murder Boyz|Young Wicked]] had left [[Psychopathic Records]] but wasn't made official until December 31, 2016 when it was announced that he had signed to [[Majik Ninja Entertainment]].

In a January 19, 2017 ICP interview with Faygoluvers.net, [[Violent J]] stated that [[Shaggy 2 Dope]] and [[DJ Clay]] were working on the album. The album features [[Violent J]] on the song "'Foggin' Up the Window" and [[DJ Clay]] on the bonus track (only available digitally) "Awww Shit". The album was released on May 26, 2017 and charted on the Billboard 200 at No. 72, Independent at No. 1, R&B/Hip-Hop at No. 39, Top Album Sales at No. 18 and Artist 100 at No. 96.

On September 16, 2017, an estimated 1,500 Juggalos gathered in front of the Lincoln Memorial to organize a concert and [[Juggalo March|all-day rally]] in protest of their gang classification,  and "class-based discrimination by law enforcement".<ref>{{cite web | title=Juggalos descend on D.C. to fight FBI gang distinction as pro-Trump activists rally | website=USA TODAY | date=2017-09-16 | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/09/16/hundreds-pro-trump-activists-descend-d-c-mother-all-rallies/673539001/ | access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | author=The Associated Press | title=Insane Clown Posse Juggalos March on Washington Outnumbers Pro-Trump Rally | website=Billboard | date=2017-09-16 | url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7965930/insane-clown-posse-juggalos-march-on-washington-pro-trump-rally | access-date=2017-10-19}}</ref>

===Live performances===

[[File:ICP concert.jpg|thumb|Insane Clown Posse often brings the entire lineup out to end its elaborate live performances.]]

Insane Clown Posse is known for their elaborate concert performances. In Marley Brant's ''Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway'', Bruce described a typical performance: "We toss out, kick out, and shoot out into the crowd about three to four hundred two-liters of [[Faygo]] at every show...We bring with us monsters, dancing clowns, girls, [[trampoline]]s, and pure and absolute madness to the stage...Shaggy and I know that without all that crazy shit going on around us, we'd just be two more idiots walking back and forth, rapping on stage...ICP's motto has always been 'Fuck keepin' it real: we just keep it entertaining.'"<ref name="Brant">{{cite book |last=Brant |first=Marley |title=Tales from the Rock 'n' Roll Highway |year=2004 |publisher=Billboard Books |isbn=0-8230-8437-X |pages=43–52 }}</ref> Performances feature backdrops including, among other settings, a [[game show]] set and a cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.theorion.com/media/storage/paper889/news/2003/02/12/Entertainment/Insane.Clown.Posse-1511352.shtml |title=Face-painting, Faygo-spraying band gets it right the second time |access-date=May 5, 2008 |last=Grace |first=Dane |date=February 12, 2003 |publisher=The Orion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100727122332/http://www.theorion.com/2.692/insane-clown-posse-1.17457|archive-date=July 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.www.jagbytes.com/media/storage/paper1244/news/2007/10/31/Entertainment/Concert.Review.Icps.Indy.Stop.Leaves.Crazed.Fans.Sticky.Yet.Satisfied-3066636.shtml |title=Concert Review: ICP's Indy stop leaves crazed fans sticky, yet satisfied |access-date=May 5, 2008 |last=Taylor |first=Lindsey |date=October 31, 2007 |publisher=JagBytes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102213227/http://media.www.jagbytes.com/media/storage/paper1244/news/2007/10/31/Entertainment/Concert.Review.Icps.Indy.Stop.Leaves.Crazed.Fans.Sticky.Yet.Satisfied-3066636.shtml|archive-date=November 2, 2007}}</ref> Bruce stated, "We always have a different set, not only for Hallowicked but every tour we go out on. We've been around so long that we get to dig up the many cool sets that we used back in the day and then get to use them again on a national level. Something we might've done once in '94 at St. Andrew's Hall, we can go back again and now do it nationwide-style".<ref name="Dominic"/>

On tour following the release of ''Dog Beats'', Insane Clown Posse was scheduled to perform at [[Ferris State University]] in [[Big Rapids, Michigan]], but were delayed by a blizzard. After they arrived, the group was announced by their manager, Alex Abbiss. Bruce remembers that "[w]e came out with no microphones or nothing; we were just right up in the people's faces. Shaggy and I were just fuckin' yelling over our own cassette. The people were staring at us in amazement and bewilderment. They must have been in shock and awe. We finished our two-song set, and the crowd...didn't cheer or boo. They just stood there, stunned"; they later learned that the concert was supposed to occur earlier in the evening, and that they were performing in the wrong building.<ref name="Brant"/>

The group was unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit [[Visa (document)|visa]] because [[customs]] believed that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts.<ref name="BehindthePaint387"/> As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, "The craziness was this: they were not the regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount&nbsp;... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference".<ref name="Brant"/> During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided [[MIM-104 Patriot|Patriot missile]], right towards the [[disco ball]] high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and&nbsp;... came falling down&nbsp;... on top of some English kid's head.&nbsp;... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour...Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from them things hittin' us".<ref name="Brant"/>

Bruce and Utsler did not expect many of their fans to attend Woodstock 1999, and were surprised when thousands of people chanted "I-C-P! I-C-P!" as they waited for the group to perform.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce told his stage crew that he would pay $2,000 to each person who ran around the stage naked, and two people took up his offer. Insane Clown Posse also brought naked women on stage.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce and Utsler felt that because the tickets to the event were over-priced, they needed to "give something back."<ref name="Brant"/> According to Bruce, "We brought along these big beach balls. We announced to the crowd that they each had a hundred dollars taped to them, and then we proceeded to kick about thirty of them into the crowd. Then we rolled out these bigger giant-ass beach balls and announced, 'These ones have five hundred bucks taped to them!' We booted a gang of them into the human sea."<ref name="Brant"/><ref name="BehindthePaint444"/> Bruce also recounts that their set had multiple technical problems, and the audience was not allowed to get close to the stage, which made the duo feel less connected with them.<ref name="BehindthePaint444"/>

The group's 2009 tour in support of ''Bang! Pow! Boom!'' featured clowns, [[showgirl]]s, a [[ringmaster (circus)|ringmaster]] and caged "attractions", including "Ape Boy".<ref name="Sculley">{{cite news|title=Insane Clown Posse gets topical on latest CD |first=Alan |last=Sculley |url=http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20091204/ENTERTAINMENT01/91201031/Insane-Clown-Posse-gets-topical-on-latest-CD |newspaper=[[Courier News (New Jersey)|Courier News]] |date=December 4, 2009 |access-date=December 17, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100511234732/http://www.mycentraljersey.com/article/20091204/ENTERTAINMENT01/91201031/Insane-Clown-Posse-gets-topical-on-latest-CD |archive-date=May 11, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Review: ICP show blends family with Faygo |first=Danielle |last=Hatch |url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/x819331739/Review-ICP-show-blends-family-with-Faygo |newspaper=[[Peoria Journal Star]] |date=December 12, 2009 |access-date=December 12, 2009 }}</ref> According to Bruce, "This is actually the biggest tour we've ever brought out, as far as stage theatrics and extras on stage...We've got a whole circus.

===Spirituality===
The themes of God's presence and the final judgment of individuals are explored in multiple Insane Clown Posse songs. Throughout their career, the group has used parables set within the Dark Carnival mythology to warn of the ultimate consequences of immoral behavior.<ref name="Dominic"/><ref name="Ronson">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/oct/09/insane-clown-posse-christians-god |title=Insane Clown Posse: And God created controversy |author=Jon Ronson |date=October 9, 2010 |access-date=October 15, 2010 |location=London |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Their 2002 album ''[[The Wraith: Shangri-La]]'' ended the first set of Joker Card albums and included the song ''The Unveiling'', which explicitly revealed that the hidden message of ICP's music had always been to follow [[God]].<ref name="BehindthePaint504"/><ref name="Dominic"/><ref name="Ronson"/> Joseph Bruce remarked that "The ending of the Joker Cards, the way we looked at it, was death. [[Heaven]] and [[hell]]. That's up to each and every juggalo [to decide]".<ref name="Dominic"/>

Several journalists have commented on the apparent conflict between the group's sexualized and often violent lyrics and their stated spiritual message.<ref name="Sculley"/><ref name="Ronson"/> In a June 2010 interview with ''[[The Columbian]]'''s Alan Sculley, Bruce explained, "[Sex and violence is] the stuff that people are talking about on the streets...to get attention, you have to speak their language. You have to interest them, gain their trust, talk to them and show you're one of them. You're a person from the street and speak of your experiences. Then at the end you can tell them God has helped me out like this and it might transfer over instead of just come straight out and just speak straight out of religion".<ref name="Sculley"/>

In an October 2010 article for ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[Jon Ronson]] characterized the Insane Clown Posse as "evangelical Christians" who have "only been pretending to be brutal and sadistic to trick their fans into believing in God".<ref name="Ronson"/> In an interview with ICP conducted for the article, two of Ronson's queries referred parenthetically to ICP's "Christian message" and to the members' identities as "[secret] Christians". Several papers, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'', published summaries of Ronson's claims.<ref name="WaPo">{{cite news|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/10/polls_insane_clown_posse_serio.html |title=Polls: Insane Clown Posse: Serious about being Christians, or having a Joaquin Phoenix moment? |author=Allison Stewart |date=October 12, 2010 |access-date=November 1, 2010 |work=The Washington Post |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013042806/http://blog.washingtonpost.com/clicktrack/2010/10/polls_insane_clown_posse_serio.html |archive-date=October 13, 2010 }}</ref>

Eight days after publication of the ''Guardian'' article, Joseph Bruce Tweeted "I think [it's] crazy how some press say we're a Christian band and act like we're all religious [...] I'm proud that we believe in God but I haven't been to church since I was like 10.

We just [...] want to see good people hopefully go to heaven, which we refer to as [[The Wraith: Shangri-La|Shangri-La]]".<ref name="G4"/> Joseph Utsler explained in a 2002 interview with Craig Markley that "God is in your heart [...] In my definition, it doesn't matter what [[creed]], [[religion]], or [[Religious denomination|group]] you belong to.

==Wrestling==
{{Main|Professional wrestling career of Insane Clown Posse}}
Both Bruce and Utsler began wrestling as single competitors in 1983 in their [[backyard wrestling]] promotion ''Tag Team Wrestling'', later renamed ''National All-Star Wrestling''.<ref name="BehindthePaint51"/> The two moved on to compete in various [[Independent circuit|independent promotions]] in [[Michigan]] from 1990 to 1997 before making an appearance together in [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] (ECW) as Insane Clown Posse.<ref name="BehindthePaint336"/> In 1998, the team had a three-month stint in [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF, now WWE) where they wrestled alongside The [[The Oddities (professional wrestling)|Oddities]] and, later, [[The Headbangers]].<ref name="BehindthePaint398">{{cite book|last1=Bruce|first1=Joseph|author-link=Violent J |last2=Echlin |first2=Hobey|editor=Nathan Fostey|title=ICP: Behind the Paint|url=https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol|url-access=registration|edition=2nd|publisher=Psychopathic Records|location=Royal Oak, Michigan|isbn=0-9741846-0-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/icpbehindpaint00viol/page/398 398–413]|chapter=Taking Bumps|date=August 2003}}</ref>
