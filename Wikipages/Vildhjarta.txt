'''Vildhjarta''' is a Swedish [[progressive metal]] band from [[Hudiksvall]], formed in 2005. The band plays in a [[Meshuggah]]-influenced musical style employing heavily down-tuned seven-string guitars, as well as harmonic minor chord progressions, jarring staccato riffs, layers of reverberant guitars and dual lead vocalists.

The group released a two-track EP entitled ''Omnislash'' in 2009 before they proceeded to sign with [[Century Media Records]] in 2011, spawning their debut full-length album ''[[Måsstaden]]'' that same year. In 2013, they followed up with a second EP, ''[[Thousands of Evils]]'' released on an exclusive 1,000-copy [[Gramophone record|vinyl record]] run. Their second full-length album ''Måsstaden Under Vatten'' was released in October 2021.

The word "vildhjärta" translates to "wildheart" in Swedish.

== History ==
Vildhjarta was founded initially as an idea by Daniel Bergström, Jimmie Åkerström, and Johan Nyberg in 2005 in [[Hudiksvall]], Sweden. The band's earliest days consisted of three members (all spread throughout different parts of Sweden).

According to Vildhjarta guitarist Daniel Bergström, commitment to their fans and "the art of music itself", only allowed for three songs to be released in the four years before the release of their first full-length album. After acquiring additional members and years of trading e-mails with metal label giant [[Century Media]] they signed a worldwide record contract in the Spring of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/artist.aspx?IdArtist=496 |title=Century Media Records – Vildhjarta |publisher=Centurymedia.com |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Måsstaden]]'', is a concept-album that "tells the tale of a hidden and isolated town, narrated in a classic fable manner". Sources of inspiration for the album's story included ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' and ''[[Moomin|Mumindalen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bergström|first=Daniel|title=Vildhjärta Interview|url=http://got-djent.com/article/vildhjarta-interview-rock-street-journal|publisher=Got-djent.com|access-date=30 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Thomér|first=Carl-Magnus|title=Vildhjärta Spanish Interview|url=http://www.noise-zone.com/?p=1159|publisher=Noise-zone.com|access-date=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530051517/http://www.noise-zone.com/?p=1159|archive-date=30 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album received a favourable review from Consequence of Sound, who called it "a harsh, fantastic, concept work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2011/12/album-review-vildhjarta-masstaden/ |title=Album Review: Vildhjarta – Måsstaden « Consequence of Sound |publisher=Consequenceofsound.net |date=12 December 2011 |access-date=8 February 2012}}</ref> 2011 also saw a major line-up change in the band: Vilhelm Bladin replaced Robert Luciani who parted ways and formed the band Means End together with former [[Uneven Structure]] drummer Christian Schreil.

On 20 April 2012, Jimmie Åkerström left the band. Fans were told it would not affect Vildhjarta's writing or touring plans. In May they embarked on a European tour with [[Veil of Maya]], Volumes, and Structures.

In late 2012, the band announced that they were planning to release an EP of new material, entitled ''[[Thousands of Evils]]''. 3 clips from the EP were released and a new song was debuted live on the "Euroblast Tour" in late 2012. The EP was released as a limited edition [[vinyl record|vinyl]]. After the release of ''Thousands of Evils'', the band became relatively silent about any future endeavors. It wasn't until late 2016 that Vildhjarta unveiled a minute-long teaser for new music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/av/holy-shit-vildhjarta-just-posted|title=VILDHJARTA Just Posted One Minute Of New Music And It's Devastating|date=7 September 2016|website=Metalinjection.net|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> In 2018, the band also confirmed that they would be performing an exclusive show for the 2018 Euroblast festival.

Calle Thomér launched a solo project called "stoort neer", releasing an instrumental album ''en glad titel på en sorglig skiva'' on 19 September 2018. The album includes guest contributions from fellow Vildhjarta members.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecirclepit.com/2018/09/vildhjarta-humaniys-last-breath-members-put-out-stoort-neer|title=Vildhjarta / Humaniy's Last Breath members put out stoort neer|publisher=thecirclepit.com/|access-date=20 September 2021}}</ref> He has also been a guitarist in Humanity's Last Breath since 2016, of which Buster Odeholm is a founding member.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalkingdom.net/band/humanity%27s-last-breath-14984|title=Humaniy's Last Breath members|publisher=metalkingdom.net/|access-date=23 September 2021}}</ref>

In November 2019, the group released "Den Helige Anden", which would be the first single of their upcoming album titled ''kaos2'' with an estimated release date of 2020.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.centurymedia.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=23928&IdCompany=3|title=Century Media Records – Vildhjarta: : present their brand-new single "Den Helige Anden"|website=Centurymedia.com|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref> However, it wasn't until April 2021 before further details would be announced, along with the release of a new single "när de du älskar kommer tillbaka från de döda" from an album now titled ''måsstaden under vatten''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2021/04/30/vildhjarta-post-punishing-new-track-announce-first-album-in-ten-years/|title=Vildhjarta post punishing new track - announce first album in ten years|date=30 April 2021|website=metalsucks.net|access-date=13 May 2021}}</ref> Clocking in at 80 minutes, it thematically picks up where 2011's måsstaden left off.

== Influences and meaning of "thall" ==
Guitarist Calle-Magnus Thomér cited the bands [[Meshuggah]], [[Ion Dissonance]], [[Katatonia]] and [[The Mars Volta]] as some of the group's most prominent influences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gigview.be/interviews/interview-vildhjarta-calle-thom%C3%A9r|title=Interview Vildhjarta: Calle Thomér|date=22 November 2011|website=Gigview.be|access-date=18 September 2021}}</ref>

With their distinct take on [[djent]], Vildhjarta inadvertently coined the accompanying word ''thall'', which the group have used to describe their own music and it as well has become a [[internet meme|meme]] among the band and its fans. The etymology of thall originates from the slurred pronunciation of the [[World of Warcraft]] character [[Thrall (Warcraft)|Thrall]] when pronounced with a [[Swedish accent]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nocleansinging.com/2011/12/01/the-thall-meme/|title=The Thall Meme|date=December 2011}}</ref> More recently Vildhjarta has stated that it is just a word and "it can be whatever you want it to be."<ref name="winter thall">{{Cite web|url=https://deadrhetoric.com/features/vildhjarta-bracing-for-winter-thall/|title=Vildhjarta – Bracing for Winter Thall|date=31 March 2013|website=Deadrhetoric|access-date=18 September 2021}}</ref>
