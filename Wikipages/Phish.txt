'''Phish''' is an American rock band that formed in [[Burlington, Vermont]], in 1983. The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.

The band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the lineup has remained stable since. Phish began to perform outside of [[New England]] in the late 1980s and experienced a rise in popularity in the mid 1990s. In October 2000, the band began a two-year hiatus that ended in December 2002, but they disbanded again in August 2004. Phish reunited officially in October 2008 for subsequent reunion shows in March 2009 and since then have resumed performing regularly. All four members pursued solo careers or performed with side-projects and these projects have continued even after the band has reunited.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puterbaugh |first=Parke |title=Phish: The Biography |date=2009 |publisher=Hachette Books |isbn=978-0-306-81947-6 |pages=208 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9zyoeq86UV0C&q=phish%20break%20%22Solo%20careers%22%20mcconnell%20gordon%20anastasio&pg=PA208 }}</ref>

Phish was formed at the [[University of Vermont]] (UVM) in 1983 by guitarists [[Trey Anastasio]] and [[Jeff Holdsworth]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], and drummer [[Jon Fishman]]. Anastasio and Fishman had met that October, after Anastasio overheard Fishman playing drums in his dormitory room, and asked if he and Holdsworth could jam with him.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puterbaugh |first=Parke |title=Phish: The Biography |date=2010 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=9780306819209 |pages=19–20, 23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXD8AgAAQBAJ&q=phish&pg=PA19  }}</ref> Gordon met the trio shortly thereafter, having answered a want-ad for a bass guitarist that Anastasio had posted around the university.<ref>{{cite book |last=Puterbaugh |first=Parke |title=Phish: The Biography |date=2010 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=9780306819209 |pages=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eXD8AgAAQBAJ&q=phish&pg=PA19  }}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
According to ''The New Rolling Stone Album Guide'', the music of Phish is "oriented around group improvisation and super-extended [[groove (music)|groove]]s".<ref name="nrsag1">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|title=Phish|access-date=2008-05-11|work=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414030730/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/phish/biography|archive-date=2009-04-14|url-status=dead}}</ref> Their songs draw on a range of rock-oriented influences, including [[funk]], [[jazz fusion]], [[progressive rock]], [[bluegrass (music)|bluegrass]], and [[psychedelic rock]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Adams |first1=Sean |title=Jam band Phish to perform two shows at Hershey's Giant Center |url=https://www.pennlive.com/entertainment/2020/01/jam-band-phish-to-perform-two-shows-at-hersheys-giant-center.html |website=The Patriot-News |access-date=3 August 2020 |date=23 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Plotnicki |first1=Gideon |title=Tracing The Evolution Of Jam: From Grateful Dead, To Phish, To The Disco Biscuits |url=https://liveforlivemusic.com/features/tracing-evolution-jam-grateful-dead-phish-disco-biscuits |website=Live for Live Music |access-date=3 August 2020 |date=4 October 2016}}</ref> Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.<ref name="csmphish">{{cite web |last1=Knickerbocker |first1=Brad |title=Phish: a Rock Quartet That Dabbles in Barbershop |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1993/0423/23142.html |website=Christian Science Monitor |access-date=29 April 2020 |date=23 April 1993}}</ref> The band began to include barbershop segments in their concerts in 1993, when the four members began taking lessons from McConnell's landlord, who was a judge at barbershop competitions.<ref name="csmphish"/> In the 1997 official biography, ''The Phish Book'', Anastasio coined the term "cow-funk" to describe the band's late 1990s [[funk]] and [[jazz-funk]]-influenced playing style, observing that "What we’re doing now is really more about groove than funk.

In his 2018 book ''Twilight of the Gods'', music critic Steven Hyden wrote that he found the Grateful Dead and Phish to have "significantly different reference points" in terms of influence and style.<ref name="hyden242">{{cite book |last1=Hyden |first1=Steven |title=Twilight of the gods : a journey to the end of classic rock |date=2018 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York |isbn=978-0-06-265712-1 |page=242 |edition=First}}</ref> The Grateful Dead, Hyden explained, were "informed by the totality of American music from the first sixty years of the twentieth century: Blues, country, folk, jazz, and early rock 'n' roll," while Phish's music contains elements of "hopped-up bluegrass, jazzy disco, porno-movie funk, Broadway theatricality, and shockingly sincere barbershop harmonies. But it all stems from [[classic rock]]."<ref name="hyden242"/> Hyden observed that "If the Dead encompasses American music from roughly 1900 to 1967, Phish picks up the story right through the [[Album-oriented rock|AOR]] era, from '68 to around the time ''[[Stop Making Sense]]'' debuted in theaters in the mid-eighties."<ref name="hyden242"/>

==Live performances==
{{main|Phish concert tours and festivals}}
The driving force behind Phish is the popularity of their concerts and the fan culture surrounding the event. Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish heads descend on Virginia |url=https://www.telegram.com/article/20090306/NEWS/903060293 |website=Worcester Telegram |access-date=26 May 2020  }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ferguson |first1=Kirsten |title=Phish plays some surprises along with the expected {{!}} The Daily Gazette |url=https://dailygazette.com/article/2019/07/03/phish-plays-some-surprises-along-with-the-expected |website=dailygazette.com |access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref> With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot similar to the "Shakedown Street" bazaar held outside Grateful Dead concerts.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref>

Phish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |access-date=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; these include "Possum", "Mike's Song", "I Am Hydrogen", "Weekapaug Groove", "Harry Hood", "Runaway Jim", "Suzy Greenberg", "AC/DC Bag" and "The Lizards", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |access-date=11 April 2019}}</ref>

Because Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. In December 2002, the band launched the LivePhish website, from which official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased.<ref>{{cite web |title=LivePhish Downloads Launches |url=https://phish.com/news/live-phish-downloads-launches/ |website=Phish.com |access-date=26 May 2020}}</ref> Legal [[field recording]]s produced by [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] with boom microphones from the audience in compliance with Phish's tape trading policy<ref name="taping">{{cite web | title = Frequently Asked Questions – What is the Phish and Band Member Taping Policy? | publisher = Phish.com | url = http://phish.com/faq/#taping-guidelines | access-date = 2018-10-03}}</ref> are frequently traded on any number of music message boards. Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.<ref name="mash"/>

Fans' recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]]. However, tapers are also required to purchase a general admission ticket for concerts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Phish Tickets Website |url=http://tickets.phish.com/information/ |website=tickets.phish.com |access-date=24 October 2018}}</ref> The band disallowed tapers from patching directly into Paul Languedoc's soundboard in 1990, after a fan unplugged some of his equipment during a concert that June.<ref>{{cite web |title=FAQ - Phish.net |url=https://phish.net/faq/recording-sources |website=phish.net |access-date=24 October 2018  }}</ref>
