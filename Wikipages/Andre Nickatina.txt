==Musical career==
Andre Nickatina first appeared on the Bay Area rap scene in 1993 underneath the stage name Dre Dog. He released two albums under the stage name Dre Dog: ''[[The New Jim Jones]]'' in 1993 and ''[[I Hate You With a Passion]]'' in 1995. ''I Hate You With a Passion'' peaked at #79 on the ''Billboard'' Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and #3  on the ''Billboard'' Heatseekers chart. In 1997, Adams changed his  stage name to Andre Nickatina, and released the albums: ''Cocaine Raps'' under his own label, Filmoe Coleman Records and ''Raven in My Eyes'', which was released under the Bay Area Independent Rap Label Dogday Records.<ref name="all music"/> Unlike his albums released under the name Dre Dog, ''Cocaine Raps'' had deeper production values [First Collaborations with Producer Nick Peace]. The album ''Raven in My Eyes'' was noted for its production quality and songs that combine  "[[music sequencer|sequencers]] and keyboards that buzz and whine" with live instrumentation.<ref>{{cite news|last=Inoue|first=Todd S.|title=Andre Nickatina - Raven in My Eyes|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/01.08.98/audiofile-9801.html|work=Metroactive|date=1998-01-08|access-date=2008-05-19| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080602203814/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/01.08.98/audiofile-9801.html| archive-date= 2 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> That year, he founded his own record label, Filmoe Coleman Records. Nickatina explained in an interview with ''Strivin'' magazine that his name change was "for the better" and that he raps because he feels that he is talented enough to do so but not for the sake of popularity.<ref name="strivin">{{cite web|author=Doxx|title=Classic Interview - Andre Nickatina (formerly Dre Dog)|url=http://strivin.com/2005/08/19/classic-interview-andre-nickatina-formerly-dre-dog/|work=Strivin|date=2005-08-19|access-date=2008-05-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080602134500/http://strivin.com/2005/08/19/classic-interview-andre-nickatina-formerly-dre-dog/|archive-date=2 June 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Soon afterwards, his following three albums, ''Tears of a Clown'' (1999), ''Daiquiri Factory: Cocaine Raps, Vol. 2'', The Unreleased [Sold exclusively at shows and appearances] and ''These R the Tales'' (the latter three in 2000) gained him notoriety in the West Coast underground rap scene.<ref name="all music">{{cite web|last=Gabriel|first=Robert|title=Andre Nickatina - Biography|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p296557|pure_url=yes}}|work=Allmusic|year=2003|access-date=2008-05-19}}</ref> Mosi Reeves of the ''San Francisco Bay Guardian'' noted Nickatina's popularity at a CD release party for another underground Bay Area rapper/producer, Smoov-E; Reeves called Nickatina "a quick-witted rapper who spits as hard as [[Kurupt]] does".<ref>{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Mossi|title=Smoov-E CD-release party,          with Andre Nickatina, First Degree the D.E., and Be Gee|url=http://www.sfbg.com/36/51/x_local_live.html|work=San Francisco Bay Guardian|date=2002-09-18|access-date=2008-05-31| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080603153200/http://www.sfbg.com/36/51/x_local_live.html| archive-date= 3 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>  A combo CD/movie project, ''Conversation with a Devil'', followed in 2003.<ref name="all music"/> Lindsay Welnick, a music critic for ''[[SF Weekly]]'', regarded the film as a knockoff of the classic gangster movie [[Scarface (1932 film)|''Scarface'']].<ref name="sfweekly"/> Nate Denver for the ''SF Bay Guardian'' praised the album, though.<ref>{{cite web|last=Denver|first=Nate|title=Local Grooves - Conversation with a Devil: Cocaine Raps No. 3 (Fillmoe Coleman)|url=http://www.sfbg.com/38/05/x_local_grooves.html|work=San Francisco Bay Guardian|date=2003-10-22|access-date=2008-05-31| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080603153204/http://www.sfbg.com/38/05/x_local_grooves.html| archive-date= 3 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Another album, ''The Gift'' followed in 2005, when the newspaper ''SF Weekly'' named Nickatina the "Best Local Hip Hop Legend" of that year. That same year, he would collaborate with Ilych Sato, better known as Equipto, for his 14th studio album titled "Horns and Halos", which would be accompanied by two sequels later that year and in the following year. Also, in 2005, Nickatina won the first annual Bay Area Raps Awards for Best Underground Artist. In 2008, he released ''A Tale of Two Andres'' with [[Mac Dre]]. Although they released only three songs together ("Andre N Andre", "U Beezy", "My Homeboy's Chevy"), they were close friends and the album was a tribute to his memory.<ref name="legend">{{cite news|title=Best Local Hip Hop Legend (2005) - Andre Nickatina|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/bestof/2005/award/best-local-hip-hop-legend-66923/|year=2005|access-date=January 14, 2011}}</ref> Nickatina's self-entitled 2013 album debuted at #46 on the [[R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] chart and #12 on the [[Heatseekers Albums]] chart, and at a time appeared on iTunes' main albums chart, making it his most successful album to date.

In 2020, Nickatina released a line of sneakers called "Killer Whales" with the Clothing Coach.<ref>{{cite web|title=SF Rapper Andre Nickatina Creates Sneaker Line with Local Clothing Designer Deezoe the Clothing Coach|url=https://sfist.com/2020/11/11/sf-rapper-andre-nickatina-creates-sneaker-line-with-local-clothing-designer/|work=SFist| url-status=live}}</ref> Also in 2020, Nickatina appeared on San Francisco rapper Dregs One's single "Fog Mode" and in the accompanying music video.<ref>{{cite web|last=Harshaw|first=Pendarvis|title=A Salute to San Francisco Rap|url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/13895586/a-salute-to-san-francisco-rap|work=KQED| archive-date= 15 April 2021 | url-status=live}}</ref>
