'''Hellyeah''', stylized as '''HELLYEAH''', was an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in [[Dallas]], Texas, in 2006. The band's last lineup consisted of lead vocalist [[Chad Gray]], guitarists Christian Brady and [[Tom Maxwell (guitarist)|Tom Maxwell]], bassist Kyle Sanders, and drummer [[Roy Mayorga]]. The idea to form a supergroup originated in 2000 on the [[Tattoo the Earth]] tour, although plans were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. The summer of 2006 allowed the band to take the project seriously and record its first album. Recorded at Chasin' Jason studio in [[Dimebag Darrell]]'s backyard, their [[Hellyeah (album)|self-titled]] album entered the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 9,<ref name="billboard-1">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=hellyeah|chart=all}}|title=Hellyeah Billboard 200 Chart History|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> selling 45,000 copies. They went on to release five more studio albums between 2010 and 2019. As of 2021, the band is on hiatus.

=== Formation and early days ===
[[file:Chad Gray - 9-30 Club.jpg|thumb|upright|Founding member and vocalist [[Chad Gray]] in 2009]]
Hellyeah's beginnings can be traced back to 2000 on the Tattoo the Earth tour featuring [[Mudvayne]], [[Nothingface (band)|Nothingface]], [[Slayer]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], and [[Sevendust]].<ref name="Allmusic Hellyeah">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1031139|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hellyeah - Hellyeah|website=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> Nothingface guitarist [[Tom Maxwell (guitarist)|Tom Maxwell]] became friends with Mudvayne vocalist [[Chad Gray]], and they talked about the possibility of forming a supergroup.<ref name="Allmusic Hellyeah"/> The following year, Nothingface toured with Mudvayne and talks to form the supergroup continued, although were constantly put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. At this time, Gray and Maxwell had brainstormed five band names.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=166402|title=Mudvayne 'On Hiatus' For At Least Two More Years|date=November 21, 2011|work=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=January 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123072455/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=166402|archive-date=January 23, 2012}}</ref>

Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett approached Maxwell "out of the blue" and wanted to join the band. Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles originally helmed the drum kit for the band's demo, however, things did not work out and the search for a new drummer began.<ref name = "Rvr"/> The band knew former [[Pantera]] and [[Damageplan]] drummer [[Vinnie Paul]], and tried to persuade him to join the band as their drummer. Originally, Paul was not sure if he would return to music after the death of his brother, [[Dimebag Darrell]] and an 18-month hiatus: "It was one of those things that I didn't think I'd be a part of this ever again without him, and after about a year and a half had gone by, these guys called me up, Chad [Gray] and Tom [Maxwell], they were like, 'We're thinking about putting this band together, would you be into it?' First couple of times, I told them, 'No, I don't think I'm ready to do this yet.' And they just were real persistent, they kept calling me. And one night, I had been drinking some red wine and listening to some [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on 12" [[vinyl record]] and I said, 'You know what, lets take a shot at this, lets see what happens.'"<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://thescreamqueen.com/VinniePaulInterview.html |title=The Scream Queen Interviews Vinnie Paul of HELLYEAH and Pantera! |last=Williams |first=Jenna |date=May 16, 2011 |website=TheScreamQueen.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522214140/http://thescreamqueen.com/VinniePaulInterview.html |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |url-status=dead |access-date=April 22, 2018}}</ref>

The band's persistence paid off and Paul joined the project. Paul commented about joining the project: "Everybody had their head in the right place and that let's-tear-the-world-a-new-ass attitude".<ref name="HELLYEAH - interview with Vinnie Paul - May 2007">{{cite web|title=Hellyeah – interview with Vinnie Paul – May 2007|author=Florino, Rick|publisher=maximumink.com|date=May 4, 2007|url=http://www.maximumink.com/articles.php?articleId=1134|access-date=November 16, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106081916/http://www.maximumink.com/articles.php?articleId=1134|archive-date=November 6, 2007}}</ref>

In their previous bands, there had only been one guitarist, so having two was a new experience for all members. Paul felt two guitarists brought back the "old school [[Iron Maiden]] thing where they play two parts and give you a grinding rhythm part with a badass melody on top".<ref name="HELLYEAH - interview with Vinnie Paul - May 2007"/> In 2006, Mudvayne did not have any plans to tour and were taking most of the summer and fall off, while Nothingface was preparing to record their next album. The time over the summer allowed the band to pursue the project which had been talked about for years.<ref name="Interview with Tom Maxwell">{{cite magazine|title      = Interview with Tom Maxwell|author     = Buchanan, Darrin|magazine  = [[Blistering]]|url        = http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/templateid/12635/menuid/3/tempidx/5/catid/4/editstatus//restemp/N%3B/fPpagesel/1?PHPSESSID=727b53caab4d4855ee7358d5315c57c1|archive-url = https://archive.today/20130102011205/http://www.blistering.com/fastpage/fpengine.php/templateid/12635/menuid/3/tempidx/5/catid/4/editstatus//restemp/N;/fPpagesel/1?PHPSESSID=727b53caab4d4855ee7358d5315c57c1|url-status   = dead|archive-date = January 2, 2013|access-date = November 16, 2007}}</ref>

Gray flew into Baltimore to Nothingface's home studio to discuss the project further. The song "Waging War" was written in two days, followed by Maxwell [[tracker (music software)|tracking]] it the next day, and Gray completing vocals. During the summer of 2006, schedules were clear, which allowed members to take the time to record a studio album.<ref name="Interview with Tom Maxwell"/> The album was recorded at Paul's backyard studio, Chasin' Jason in [[Arlington, Texas]]. Filled with photos of his late brother [[Dimebag]], Paul found it tough entering the studio where the last albums by Damageplan and Pantera, and the collaboration ''[[Rebel Meets Rebel]]'' were recorded, but felt "the dark cloud that was there went away", due to everyone's positive energy.<ref name="Hellyeah Helps Pantera's Paul Face The Music">{{cite magazine|title=Hellyeah Helps Pantera's Paul Face The Music|author=Graff, Gary|magazine=Billboard.com|date=March 29, 2007|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053327/hellyeah-helps-panteras-paul-face-the-music|access-date=November 16, 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140730123833/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1053327/hellyeah-helps-panteras-paul-face-the-music|archive-date=July 30, 2014}}</ref> Maxwell and Tribbett were the primary writers of the album, and Paul was there to "steer them in the right direction", with Gray adding his opinion on musical arrangements.<ref name="Interview with Tom Maxwell"/>

Paul built the members a [[cabana (structure)|cabana]] style house on his pool deck with air conditioning, a TV, and beds so the members felt comfortable while recording. Paul produced the record and Gray felt Paul "facilitated the whole thing".<ref name="Hell Yeah Interview">{{cite web|title=Hell Yeah Interview|author=Chambers, Cameron|publisher=Killyourstereo.com|date=June 15, 2007|url=http://www.killyourstereo.com/interview.php?id=16|access-date=November 16, 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071026161512/http://www.killyourstereo.com/interview.php?id=16 |archive-date = October 26, 2007}}</ref> The album was completed in roughly a month, with three recording sessions. The band worked on the record for eight days and returned home for a break. A 14-day session followed the break, and then another 10 days in the studio. Gray asserts the breaks in between recording sessions were to "re-charge the batteries", and "get a fresh head".<ref name="Hell Yeah Interview"/> As the line-up was complete, the band started to brainstorm names. When a member thought of a name, they would write it on a piece of paper and put it in an amp box outside the studio. Someone wrote "Hellyeah", and the band thought it was a perfect choice.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Paul says it's "very affirmative and full of attitude.

''Hellyeah'' received generally positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of [[Allmusic]] awarded the album three and a half stars out of five, commenting; "Their album is a competent example of its genre, in which Tribbett and Maxwell combine to create crushing riffs over the pummeling rhythm section of Paul, while Gray howls typically enraged, expletive-littered lyrics to songs". However, Ruhlmann believes Hellyeah is not a notable variation from members' previous bands.<ref name="Allmusic Hellyeah"/> [[Blabbermouth.net]] reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album 7 out of 10, praising the track "Matter of Time" for its slashing main riff, and "One Thing" as it "marches to the finish line with a rumbling, crunching wall of guitars worthy of Dimebag himself". Kaye thought that Hellyeah's first studio effort was not equal to any of its members' main output.<ref name="Hellyeah review - Blabbermouth.net">{{cite news |title=Hellyeah review - Blabbermouth.net|author=Kaye, Don|work=Blabbermouth.net|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1087|access-date=November 16, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930225735/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/showreview.aspx?reviewID=1087 |archive-date=September 30, 2007

In 2009, the band revealed that they were in the studio recording a new album, later revealed to be titled ''[[Stampede (Hellyeah album)|Stampede]]''.

For ''Stampede'', the members went to drummer [[Vinnie Paul]]'s Texas home studio, for a recording process draped in a relaxed, pressure-free atmosphere, surrounded by the obligatory cocktails, good eats and familial brotherhood. "We were doing it at my house solely. We ate, drank and BBQed together, which made the brotherhood that happened, come through in the music," Paul said. The band members lived in bungalows on the grounds and turned Paul's house into a studio. Drums were recorded downstairs and guitars were recorded upstairs, with video screens in each room so the members could see one another while tracking. "It’s a broad, diverse album that covers rock, heavy metal and Southern rock ground. That is the main thing that I like about it: it’s not so focused on one thing," Paul said. The high ceilings at the Paul home allowed for the creation of a big, booming sound. They also were able to work at their own natural pace. "We slept there, so if one of us just came up with an idea, we could jump on it," guitarist Tom Maxwell said.<ref>[http://www.hellyeahband.com/biography HELLYEAH Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218161609/http://www.hellyeahband.com/biography |date=February 18, 2012 }}.
