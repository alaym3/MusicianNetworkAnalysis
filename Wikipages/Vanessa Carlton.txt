'''Vanessa Lee Carlton''' (born August 16, 1980) is an American singer-songwriter and pianist. Upon completion of her education at the [[School of American Ballet]], Carlton chose to pursue singing instead, performing in New York City bars and clubs while attending college. Three months after recording a demo with producer [[Peter Zizzo]], she signed with [[A&M Records]]. She began recording her album, which was initially unsuccessful until [[Ron Fair]] took over.

Her debut single, "[[A Thousand Miles]]," reached the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in 2002. Her debut album, ''[[Be Not Nobody]]'', followed and received a [[music recording sales certification|platinum certification]] in the United States. Her subsequent albums, ''[[Harmonium (Vanessa Carlton album)|Harmonium]]'' (2004) and ''[[Heroes & Thieves]]'' (2007), failed to match the commercial success of the first. She produced a fourth album, ''[[Rabbits on the Run]]'' (2011), independently before seeking a record label to release it. Carlton released a holiday [[Extended play|EP]] titled ''Hear the Bells'' in November 2012, and released her fifth studio album, ''[[Liberman (album)|Liberman]]'', on October 23, 2015.<ref name="noisetrade5-7-2015">{{cite web|title=Vanessa Carlton: Young Heart EP|url=http://noisetrade.com/vanessacarlton/young-heart-ep| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/http://noisetrade.com/vanessacarlton/young-heart-ep| archive-date=2021-10-22|publisher=NoiseTrade|access-date=May 7, 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="twitter2-28-2014">{{cite web|last=Carlton|first=Vanessa|title=Twitter / Vanessa Carlton: Started in England, finished in Nashville...|url=https://twitter.com/VanessaCarlton/status/439315769122652160| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/https://twitter.com/VanessaCarlton/status/439315769122652160| archive-date=2021-10-22|publisher=Twitter|date=February 28, 2014|access-date=March 3, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref name="cbsnews6-11-2014">{{cite web|last=Moraski |first=Lauren |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vanessa-carlton-on-her-dreamy-new-album/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/vanessa-carlton-on-her-dreamy-new-album/| archive-date=2021-10-22 |title=Vanessa Carlton on her dreamy new album – CBS News |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=June 11, 2014 |access-date=June 12, 2014}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===2002–03: ''Be Not Nobody''===
Carlton first met songwriter/producer [[Peter Zizzo]] at a singer-songwriter circle. A few months later, Zizzo invited Carlton to his studio to record a demo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackvulture.com/vanessa/vc-bio.gif| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828230957/http://www.blackvulture.com/vanessa/vc-bio.gif| archive-date=2020-08-28|title= handwritten Vanessa Carlton Bio |access-date=April 17, 2008|publisher=blackvulture.com}}</ref> Three months after recording the demo, Carlton was signed by [[Jimmy Iovine]] to [[A&M Records]] and began to record an album, titled ''Rinse''.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.angelfire.com/celeb2/vanessacarlto/billboard|title=Billboard interview|access-date=April 17, 2008|magazine=Billboard Magazine|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207052232/http://www.angelfire.com/celeb2/vanessacarlto/billboard|archive-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> It was never released, but a few tracks were reworked for ''[[Be Not Nobody]]''.

Other unreleased tracks from her early demo tapes include "Faces," "Meggie Sue," "Little Mary," "Burden," "Wonder," "Devil Dance," and "Last Fall."

With her previous unsuccessful recording efforts, Carlton felt there was a lack of direction at her label.<ref name=sarah>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004423/Vanessa-Carlton.html| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608004423/Vanessa-Carlton.html| archive-date=2021-10-22|title=Sarah Parkin Bio |access-date=April 16, 2008 |publisher=musicianguide.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However, [[A&M Records|A&M]] president [[Ron Fair]] upon hearing her demo to "A Thousand Miles," began organizing recording sessions for the song, producing and arranging the song himself.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1469962/20030212/carlton_vanessa.jhtml| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20211022/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1469962/20030212/carlton_vanessa.jhtml| archive-date=2021-10-22|title=The Making of A Thousand Miles |access-date=April 17, 2008 |publisher=mtv.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref> It became a hit, peaking inside the top five on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and went on to become the sixth-most-played song of the year, as well as garnering [[45th Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]] nominations for "[[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]]," "[[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]," and "[[Best Instrumental Arrangement Accompanying Vocalist(s)]]."<ref name="complex">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/CELEBRITIES/Complex-Women/Vanessa-Carlton|title=Vanessa Carlton|access-date=December 2, 2009|first=Saidah|last=Petrie|publisher=complex.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227044058/http://www.complex.com/CELEBRITIES/Complex-Women/Vanessa-Carlton|archive-date=February 27, 2009}}</ref> Fair would produce the rest of the album.
