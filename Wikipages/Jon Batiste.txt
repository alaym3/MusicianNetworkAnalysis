In 2005, Batiste began performing regularly in New York with his Juilliard peers, bassist Phil Kuehn and drummer [[Joe Saylor]]. He later added [[Eddie Barbash]] on alto saxophone and Ibanda Ruhumbika on tuba.<ref name="The Juilliard Journal">{{cite web | url=http://www.juilliard.edu/journal/1411/discoveries/3-releases-jazz-grads | title=3 Releases From Jazz Grads | publisher=The Juilliard Journal | date=November 2014 | access-date=6 October 2015 | author=Hodges, Bruce}}</ref> Batiste named the band [[Stay Human (band)|Stay Human]], which draws its moniker from the belief that human interaction during a live musical performance can uplift humanity in the midst of the "plug in, tune out" nature of modern society. The band leads impromptu street performances, which Batiste calls "love riots".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joonbug.com/newyork/scenetracker/LoveRiot-A-Classic-Had-To-Be-There-NYC-Moment/pYKXZGHIHkh |title=#LoveRiot: A Classic "Had To Be There" NYC Moment |publisher=Joonbug.com |date=2012-04-11 |access-date=2012-09-18}}</ref> Notable artists were often seen accompanying Batiste, including [[Wynton Marsalis]], [[The Potash Twins]] and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JSPhk6fcJhI |title=Potash Twins and Jon Batiste - Union Square |publisher=YouTube.com |date=August 28, 2014|access-date=2021-11-20}}</ref>

In 2011, Stay Human released the album ''MY N.Y.'', which was recorded in its entirety on [[New York City Subway]] trains, an idea that came to Batiste after questioning how to connect with people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/jonathan-batiste-and-the-stay-human-band-fill-the-subway-with-their-take-on-jazz-6433806|title=Jonathan Batiste and the Stay Human Band Fill the Subway with Their Take on Jazz|first=Larry|last=Blumenfeld|date=4 January 2012}}</ref>

In June 2020, Batiste took part in the [[Juneteenth]] celebration in Brooklyn, New York with a day of protests, marches, rallies, and vigils to "celebrate, show solidarity, and fight for equal rights and treatment of Black people".<ref name="Juneteenth">{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=Juneteenth in Brooklyn |url=https://bklyner.com/juneteenth-in-brooklyn/ |date=June 19, 2020 |website=Bklyner |access-date=June 26, 2020}}</ref> Performing on the steps of the Brooklyn Public Library, Batiste was joined by [[Matthew Whitaker (pianist)|Matt Whitaker]] in a performance presented in partnership with [[Sing For Hope]].<ref name="Juneteenth"/>

The 2020 Juneteenth took place during the [[George Floyd protests|protests]] following the [[murder of George Floyd]], as well as the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], seen by some as connected to an increase in an awareness of racial injustice.<ref>{{cite web |first=David|last=Robinson|author2=David McKay Wilson|author3=Nancy Cutler|author4=Ashley Biviano|author5=Matt Steecker|title=Why George Floyd's death, COVID-19 inequality sparked protests: 'We're witnessing history' |url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/coronavirus/2020/06/05/george-floyd-death-covid-19-racial-inequality-sparked-protests/3143236001/ |website=lohud |date=June 5, 2020|access-date=June 26, 2020}}</ref> When questioned as to the differences he sees in the present movement for change, and its connection to music, Batiste responded by saying: "...music has always been something that has had all of the different purposes of our life and our community and our healing and our unspoken pain{{snd}}and the transmission of messages and the raising awareness of a condition of a people. [...] What's different now is that it's much more widespread in the support of changing the systemic oppression that's been going on for 400 years." He believes, "Now, it's more important than ever for us to be reintroduced to what our ancestors used music for, because it's been forgotten. [...] The world at large sees music as entertainment. It's never been that, at its root. It is that in one element of it, but the entire spectrum of music is far, far deeper and wide-ranging."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fancher |first1=Lou |title=For Jon Batiste, Music Is the Way to Transformation |url=https://www.sfcv.org/events-calendar/artist-spotlight/for-jon-batiste-music-is-the-way-to-transformation |website=San Francisco Classical Voice |date=June 22, 2020|access-date=June 26, 2020}}</ref>
