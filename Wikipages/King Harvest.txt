'''King Harvest''' was a 1970s [[France|French]]-[[United States|American]] [[rock music|rock]] band that formed initially in [[Ithaca, New York]], but broke up and reformed in Paris, where they began recording their first songs.<ref name= "auto"/>  They are known for their 1972 [[hit single]], "[[Dancing in the Moonlight]]".

==Career==
King Harvest's original four members first formed the group in 1969 in  [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York (state)|New York]], where all four - Dave "Doc" Robinson ([[lead vocals]]/[[bass guitar|bass]]/[[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), [[Ron Altbach]] (keyboards), [[Ed Tuleja]] ([[guitar]]), and Rod Novak ([[saxophone]]) - were attending [[Cornell University]].  At this point, the group primarily played cover tunes by such artists as [[Sly and the Family Stone]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[The Band]], among others, at fraternities, bars, and other local colleges.  The group broke up for the first time in 1971.<ref name= "auto"/>

However, one by one,<ref name= "Reverb">[http://www.kingharvest.reverbnation.com/#about King Harvest @ReverbNation.com] Retrieved June 19, 2021.</ref> each of the four former bandmates would migrate to Paris that same year, where they reformed King Harvest, now as expatriates.  Although the band's membership fluctuated constantly over the next five years, it always included its four core co-founders.  [[France|French]] musician Didier Alexandre was among the first to join the quartet, becoming a member of the group in the early 1970s. At one point, the band consisted of three [[keyboardist]]s, with fellow Cornell alumnus<ref name= "Sherman">[https://www.shermankelly.com/about "About Sherman Kelly" @shermankelly.com] Retrieved June 19, 2021.</ref> Sherman Kelly (who wrote "Dancing in the Moonlight") joining Altbach and Robinson on the instrument.  Sherman Kelly had previously performed together with Robinson in the band Boffalongo, who first recorded "Dancing in the Moonlight" in 1970.  Sherman Kelly's brother, drummer [[Wells Kelly]], who went on to form the band [[Orleans (band)|Orleans]], also served a brief stint in the group both in Paris and in the US.

===Early years===
As group members gradually made their way to Paris, they became involved in session work individually, performing on albums by the likes of [[Jacques Morali]] and [[Nancy Holloway]].  Altbach also studied classical music with [[Nadia Boulanger]].  Once solidified as a unit, King Harvest won a Rock and Roll contest/talent show,<ref name= "Reverb"/> and by the end of 1971, with Alexandre and Wells Kelly now established as bandmembers, the group had recorded and released their Europe-only debut LP, ''I Can Tell''.  Curiously, although Doc Robinson is apparently pictured on the album cover, he is not credited in the liner notes as having performed on the album.<ref>King Harvest - ''I Can Tell'' LP album cover.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/vinyl/album/blps19042|title=Vinyl Album: King Harvest - I Can Tell (1971)|access-date=19 September 2021|website=45worlds.com}}</ref>

Also in 1971, King Harvest was invited to write and perform songs for the French film, ''Le Feu Sacré'', which represented France at that year's [[Cannes Film Festival]].  Throughout these early days in Paris, King Harvest also performed and recorded under pseudonyms, such as E. Rodney Jones and the Prairie Dogs.<ref name= "Reverb"/>

==="Dancing in the Moonlight"===
It was Wells Kelly who convinced the group to revisit "Dancing in the Moonlight", but he left Paris before the song was recorded. Steve Cutler, a [[jazz]] drummer and fellow expatriate from [[New York (state)|New York]], joined King Harvest for their last six months in Paris, recording "Dancing in the Moonlight" and playing clubs and concerts in Paris and London.  Reportedly, Cutler performed the drum/percussion parts on the recording using a toilet scrubbing brush, as opposed to the traditional drumsticks.<ref name= "auto"/> The song was produced by Jack Robinson of Robin Song Music.  Contrary to Boffalongo's original version, which included such disparate players as jazz flutist [[Jeremy Steig]] and Peter Giansante on drums, the King Harvest recording was more scaled back.  A [[Single (music)|45 rpm]] record of "Dancing in the Moonlight" was released in Paris, with "Lady, Come on Home" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. The single languished, and the group again (temporarily) disbanded.

However, in 1972, "Dancing in the Moonlight" began to generate interest back home in America, where the original four members signed with the [[Perception Records|Perception]] label.  Perception promptly leased the tune from France's [[Musidisc]] Records and prepared the group, now re-established in [[Olcott, New York]],<ref name= "auto"/> to record a full-length album titled after the single.  Meanwhile, the single went on to reach No. 13 in the US in early 1973 and No. 5 in Canada, and the band embarked on a lengthy U.S. tour.<ref name= "auto"/> [[Australia]]n drummer David Montgomery, formerly of the band [[Python Lee Jackson]], officially joined King Harvest after the album's release and toured with them during the spring of 1973.  "Dancing in the Moonlight" composer Sherman Kelly, who had not participated in King Harvest's recording of the single, also officially joined the band for the first time for this tour.<ref name= "Sherman"/>

===Subsequent career===
Despite the success of its titular single, the ''Dancing in the Moonlight'' album failed to crack the Top 100 on the [[Billboard 200]] or generate any widely successful follow-up singles,<ref name="LarkinGE"/> and the Perception label soon went bankrupt.<ref name= "auto"/>  Band membership continued to fluctuate as the group pressed on. The original four members joined with LA-based Buffalo Rock and Roll Hall of Fame drummer Richie Pidanick in 1974.<ref>[https://www.bmhof.org/inductees-p/rich-pidanick.html Rich Pidanick - Buffalo Music Hall of Fame] Retrieved July 5, 2021.</ref>  With support from [[Beach Boys]] members [[Carl Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]], this line-up signed with [[A&M Records]] and recorded another album, simply titled ''King Harvest''.<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|pages=1376/7}}</ref>  Released in 1975, this album did not produce any hits, with lone single "Hickory" failing to break into the chart.<ref name="LarkinGE"/>  Other members of the band at various times during these later years included another Python Lee Jackson alumnus Tony Cahill (bass guitar) and [[Beach Boys|Beach Boy]] Bobby Figueroa (drums). All members had been involved previously with other bands and done [[session musician|session work]].  Finding themselves unable to match the success of their massive first hit, King Harvest broke up once again in 1976.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/king-harvest-mn0000090276/biography|title=King Harvest {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref>

Following the band's dissolution, King Harvest's members continued their association with the Beach Boys.  Novak, Altbach, Tuleja, and Figueroa toured with the group at one point. Tuleja and Novak played on [[Dennis Wilson]]'s 1977 solo ''[[Pacific Ocean Blue]]'', while Altbach and Robinson performed with Mike Love in his band, [[Celebration (1970s band)|Celebration]].<ref name="LarkinGE"/>

==Reunions and other post-2000 activities==
Novak and Tuleja went on to play country western in Scandinavia and released the album ''King Harvest - The Prairie Dogs' Classic Country'' produced by George Doering. Their recording of "Looking For Love" from the album later appeared in the 2014 movie ''OK Buckeroos - The Life, Music and Good Times of Jerry Jeff Walker''.

King Harvest released their ''The Lost Tapes'' album in August 2007, and performed on [[TJ Lubinsky]]'s My Music DVD entitled ''The 70s Experience Live'' produced for [[PBS]].

On July 14, 2012, the four co-founders reunited in Olcott Beach as part of a 40th anniversary reunion of the band.<ref name=":0" /> Doc Robinson died December 11, 2012, leaving behind his wife, daughter and grandchildren. He was buried in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], his birthplace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=David-Robinson&lc=4838&pid=161787355&mid=5344504|title=David Robinson Obituary|website=obits.dignitymemorial.com|access-date=2017-10-28}}</ref> The other three members reunited again on July 19, 2013 in Olcott Beach with a song titled "Doc" in memory of him.

The King Harvest album ''Old Friends'' was released on April 6, 2015.

The three surviving founding members released their new King Harvest single "Our Old Songs" on August 16, 2016.
