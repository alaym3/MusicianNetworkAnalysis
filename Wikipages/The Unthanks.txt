===The Unthanks===
====''Here's the Tender Coming''====
In 2009, the band became the Unthanks, and their manager [[Adrian McNally]] and his childhood friend Chris Price<ref name= miserable/> joined the group. ''[[Here's the Tender Coming]]'', their third album (and the first under the Unthanks moniker), was released on 14 September 2009.<ref name="New name"/> It was Folk Album of the Year for ''[[The Guardian]]'' and also for ''Mojo'' magazine.<ref name="Guardian bio"/> [[Sid Smith (author)|Sid Smith]], of BBC Music, described it as an "astonishing record", "beautiful", "haunting", and "beguiling".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/fb9p|title= Here's the Tender Coming raises the group's standard higher still|author= Sid Smith |work= [[BBC Music]], BBC website |date= 2 October 2009 |accessdate= 28 April 2011|author-link= Sid Smith (author)}}</ref> In a four-starred review for ''The Guardian'', [[Colin Irwin (journalist)|Colin Irwin]] said: "This album may not be quite as bleak as The Bairns, and the sound is more sophisticated, but they still sound like nobody else... Tracks build slowly and mysteriously, but all are in service of the song. Their arrangement of the title track − a traditional song about the emotional devastation wrought by press gangs − brilliantly encapsulates the story's fraught desperation. Their version of Nobody Knew She Was There, one of [[Ewan MacColl]]'s lesser-known songs about his mother, painstakingly paints a similarly dramatic backdrop with more atmospheric brass, and they put their own stamp on the Nic Jones classic, Annachie Gordon."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/sep/06/unthanks-here-s-the-tender-coming|title= The Unthanks: Here's the Tender Coming|author= Colin Irwin |work= [[The Observer]] |date= 6 September 2009 |accessdate= 2 November 2015|author-link= Colin Irwin (journalist)}}</ref>
