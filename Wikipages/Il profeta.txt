'''''Il profeta''''' (internationally released as ''Mr. Kinky'' and ''The Prophet'') is a [[List of Italian films of 1968|1968]] [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Dino Risi]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Edoardo Zaccagnini|title=I "mostri" al lavoro!: contadini, operai, commendatori ed impiegati nella commedia all'italiana|publisher=Sovera Edizioni, 2009|isbn=8881247909}}</ref>

== Plot ==
Pietro Breccia ([[Vittorio Gassman]]) is a man who has long decided to abandon civilization, becoming a [[hermit]], leaving behind the strain of modern life and the futility of consumer society, living for years in seclusion on [[Soratte]], near [[Rome]]. One day he is discovered by a TV crew that, sniffing the scoop, film a report about him. From that moment, against his will, he gets sucked into civilization.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vice|title="Il profeta": Gassman si fa barbone per protesta contro la vita moderna|newspaper=[[La Stampa]]|date=March 10, 1968|page=7}}</ref>

== Cast ==
* [[Vittorio Gassman]]: Pietro Breccia, the hermit 
* [[Ann-Margret]]: Maggie, a [[hippy]] 
* [[Liana Orfei]]: Albertina, Puccio's sister 
* [[Fiorenzo Fiorentini]]: Luigi
* [[Oreste Lionello]]: Puccio, Breccia's manager
* [[Enzo Robutti]]: Alberto
* [[Yvonne Sanson]]: Carla Bagni 
* [[Carmen Villani]]

== Reception ==
Helped by the accurate [[Ettore Scola]], it's one of those movies from the master of Italian comedies to re-discover absolutely. Exquisite, swinging, smart, this film appeared to be an hilarious mirror of some of the most pregnant ''clich√©s'' of the occidental modernity. But it remains underrated and unknown, especially because there is no releases in DVD and Blu-ray.
