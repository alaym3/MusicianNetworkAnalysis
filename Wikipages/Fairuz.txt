By the age of ten, Nouhad was already known at school for her unusual singing voice. She would sing regularly during school shows and on holidays. This was how she came to the attention of [[Mohammed Flayfel]], a well-known musician and a teacher at the [[Conservatoire Libanais|Lebanese Conservatory]], who happened to attend one of the school's shows in February 1950. Impressed by her voice and performance, he advised her to enroll in the [[Music school|conservatory]], which she did. At first, Nouhad's conservative father was reluctant to send her to the conservatory. However, he eventually allowed her to go on the condition that her brother accompanies her at the persuasion of his brother Nouhad's uncle.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|title=Fairuz {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fairuz-mn0000163342/biography|access-date=2020-12-13|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref>

Mohammed Flayfel took a close interest in Nouhad's talent. He started training her through the chanting of Koranic verses (in the recitative style known as [[Tajweed]]) which is the way preceding artists sang, a tactic to help with her control on classic Arabic intonation and poetic form.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fairuz {{!}} Biography & History|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fairuz-mn0000163342/biography|access-date=2020-12-14|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref> In an audition, Nouhad was heard singing by [[Halim el-Roumi|Halim el Roumi]], head of the Lebanese radio station established in 1938 making it one of the oldest stations in the Arab world.

A short while later, Fairuz was introduced to the [[Rahbani brothers]], Assi and Mansour, who also worked at the radio station as musicians. Their chemistry was instant, and soon after, Assi started to compose songs for Fairouz. One of these songs was "Itab" (the third song he composed for her), which was an immediate success in all of the Arab world. It established Fairuz as one of the most prominent Arab singers on the Arabic music scene.<ref name="Fairuz - her music">{{Cite web|title=Fairuz - her music|url=https://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/700/780/fairuz/legend/music.html|access-date=2020-12-13|website=almashriq.hiof.no}}</ref>

==Career==

=== 1950s ===
Fairuz's first large-scale concert was in 1957, as part of the [[Baalbeck International Festival]] which took place under the patronage of Lebanese President [[Camille Chamoun]]. She performed in the Folkloric section of the festival representing "The Lebanese Nights". Fairuz was paid one [[Lebanese pound]] for that show, but she and the Rahbani brothers would become staples of the festival and featured most years until the civil war in Lebanon. The trio's performances at first were just small skits, but eventually they became full-blown musical operettas and concerts followed for many years, establishing Fairuz as one of the most popular singers in Lebanon and throughout the Arab world.<ref name=":6" /> Fairuz amassed more fame when she aligned herself with the Palestinian cause in their conflict with Israel and even produced a number of militaristic and patriotically somber songs for them.<ref name="Fairuz">{{Cite web|title=Fairuz|url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/doctorates/recipients/Pages/fairuz-profile.aspx|access-date=2020-12-13|website=www.aub.edu.lb}}</ref>

===1960s&nbsp;– establishment of a new star===
Fairuz and the Rahbani brothers started to garner more and more attention with their innovative ventures and went on to revolutionize the blueprint for Lebanese music. It started with incorporating western sounds into their music and eventually shaping the Lebanese style of music, since before the music had to fit into a certain mold. This mold was the dominant Egyptian style of music, in the Egyptian dialect that would typically have a duration of thirty minutes.<ref name=":8"/> The trio started working with their own prototype, which was shorter three-minute songs in the Lebanese dialect that would tell a story. This change was received as well as it was due to growing discontent for traditional and indigenous music. Beirut at this time was undergoing rapid modernization and cultural expansion. Some who lived in the city were not even of Arab background making it even harder to relate to the music forms of the time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fairuz - Biography|url=https://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/700/780/fairuz/legend/biography.html|access-date=2020-12-13|website=almashriq.hiof.no}}</ref> So when Fairuz and the Rahbani brothers introduced a more modern yet still traditional form of music, they drew in mass appeal. This helped reshape the modern Lebanese identity especially in music and would go on to make significant contributions to the history of oriental music.<ref name=":6"/> These songs would also customarily included commentary and themes of local and regional socio-political and historical issues.<sup>[33]</sup> As the 1960s wore on, Fairuz became known as the "First Lady of Lebanese singing", as Halim Roumi dubbed her. During this period the Rahbani brothers wrote and composed for her hundreds of famous songs, most of their operettas, and three motion pictures.<ref name=":6" /> In those productions, they also chose to abandon the popular improvisatory nature of Arab performances for more well-rehearsed and produced ones.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fairuz - her music|url=https://almashriq.hiof.no/lebanon/700/780/fairuz/legend/music.html|access-date=2020-12-14|website=almashriq.hiof.no}}</ref>

In 1971, Fairuz's fame became international after her major North American tour, which was received with much excitement by the [[Arab Americans|Arab-American]] and American community and yielded very positive reviews of the concerts. To date Fairuz has performed in many countries around the globe including [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Netherlands, Greece, Canada, United States, Mexico, [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], Australia, Belgium, Italy, and her home country Lebanon.<ref name="Fairuz / فيروز">{{Cite web|title=Fairuz / فيروز|url=https://www.antiwarsongs.org/artista.php?id=1523&lang=en&short=1|access-date=2020-12-13|website=www.antiwarsongs.org}}</ref>
[[File:Fairuz playing the guitar.jpg|thumb|Fairuz in the 1970s]]

On September 22, 1972, Assi suffered a brain hemorrhage and was rushed to the hospital. Fans crowded outside the hospital praying for him and lighting candles. After three surgeries, Assi's brain hemorrhage was halted. Ziad Rahbani, the eldest son of Fairuz and Assi, at age 17 gave his mother the music of one of his unreleased songs "Akhadou el Helween" (that he had composed to be sung by Marwan Mahfouz in "Sahriyyi" Ziad's first play).  His uncle Mansour Rahbani re-wrote new lyrics for it to be called "Saalouni n'Nass" ("The People Asked Me") which talked about Fayrouz being on stage for the first time without Assi.<ref name="Fairuz / فيروز"/><ref name=":6"/> Three months after suffering the hemorrhage, Assi attended the premiere performance of that musical ''Al Mahatta'' in Piccadilly Theatre on Hamra Street. Elias Rahbani, Assi's younger brother, took over the orchestration and musical arrangement for the performance.<ref name="Fairuz"/>

In 1978, the trio toured Europe and the Persian Gulf nations, including a concert at the Paris Olympia. As a result of this busy schedule, Assi's medical and mental health began to deteriorate. Assi Rahbani eventually died in 1986, no longer married to Fairuz but due to the influence, his family and Fairuz had in Lebanon the factions in Beirut had a cease-fire allowing the funeral procession to travel from the Muslim side of the city to where Assi would be buried on the Christian side. Fairuz then began to work  almost exclusively with Ziad Rahbani, her son on producing her music.<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":6" /><ref name="Telegraph" />

Amid the [[Lebanese Civil War]], Fairuz's fame catapulted. Unlike many of her famous peers, she never left Lebanon to live abroad. She did not hold any concerts there with the exception of the stage performance of the operetta ''Petra'', which was performed in both the western and eastern parts of the then-divided Beirut in 1978.<ref name=":5" /><ref name=":6" /> The war lasted fifteen years (1975–1990), took 150,000 lives, and fostered a divided nation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lebanese Civil War {{!}} History, Causes, Effects, & Combatants|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War|access-date=2020-12-13|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> This was the period where her role as a prominent Lebanese figure would be cemented. She and the Rahbani brothers would frequently express their dissent for the war in their music, and their refusal to take sides and non-partisan stances helped them appeal to all of Lebanon, which then allowed Fairuz to become a voice of reason and unification for the Lebanese people. This was especially important because the war itself was so multifaceted and involved many conflicting opinions between the state and different militias.  To the Lebanese, she became a lot more than just an entertainer. She became a representation of Lebanon, as well as stability in a time of insecurity and uncertainty.<ref name=":8" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Lebanese Civil War {{!}} History, Causes, Effects, & Combatants|url=https://www.britannica.com/event/Lebanese-Civil-War|access-date=2020-12-14|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

===1980s&nbsp;– A new production team===
After the artistic divorce between Fairouz and the Rahbani brothers in 1979, Fairuz carried on with her son, composer Ziad Rahbani, his friend the lyricist [[Joseph Harb]], and composer Philemon Wahbi.<ref name=":6" /> Ziad Rahbani was a constant driving force in the evolution of Fairuz's music style, as he worked to break away from what his parents had previously established. The songs he went on to compose for Fairuz would stray from the nostalgic nationalism that showcased the folkloric style Fairuz and the Rahbani brothers were known for; instead, he and Fairuz would go on to delve into a more modern sound in the form of jazz and funk.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haugbolle|first=Sune|date=2016|title=THE LEFTIST, THE LIBERAL, AND THE SPACE IN BETWEEN: ZIAD RAHBANI AND EVERYDAY IDEOLOGY|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44746851|journal=The Arab Studies Journal|volume=24|issue=1|pages=168–190|issn=1083-4753}}</ref> 

Fairuz made a second and final European Television appearance on French TV on October 13, 1988, in a show called ''Du côté de chez Fred''. Fairuz, who had scheduled a concert at the [[POPB]] of Paris Bercy concert hall three days later on October 16, was the main guest of French TV presenter [[Frédéric Mitterrand]]. The program features footage of her rehearsals for her concert at Bercy in addition to the ceremony featuring then French Minister of Culture [[Jack Lang (French politician)|Jack Lang]] awarding Fairuz the medal of [[Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres]]. It also includes a video montage of her previous movies and concerts. In that show, Fairuz also sang the three songs "Ya hourrié", "Yara" and "Zaali tawwal".

Her first CD, ''The Very Best of Fairuz,'' was published in 1987 and contained the emblematic song "Aatini al Nay wa ghanni" (Give me the flute and sing),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lyricstranslate.com/fr/aatini-al-nay-wa-ghanni-give-me-flute-nay-and-sing.html|title=Fairuz - Paroles de " Atini Alnay Wa Ghanny- أعطني الناي و غن " + traduction en anglais|website=Lyricstranslate.com}}</ref> based on a poem in "The Procession"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vr_5C88-H5wC&pg=P223|title=A Treasury of Kahlil Gibran|first=Kahlil|last=Gibran|date=December 20, 2011|publisher=Open Road Media|isbn=9781453235546|via=Google Books}}</ref> by [[Khalil Gibran]].

===1990s – present===
In the 1990s, Fairuz produced six albums (two Philemon Wahbi tributes with unreleased tracks included, a [[Zaki Nassif]] album, three Ziad Rahbani albums, and a tribute album to Assi Rahbani orchestrated by Ziad) and held a number of large-scale concerts, most notably the historic concert held at Beirut's [[Martyrs' Square, Beirut|Martyr's Square]] in September 1994 to launch the rebirth of the downtown district that was ravaged by the civil war. She appeared at the [[Baalbeck International Festival]] in 1998 after 25 years of self-imposed absence where she performed the highlights of three very successful plays that were presented in the 1960s and 1970s.

In 1992, [[Madonna]] used some parts of Fairuz's songs in her album without permission; the singers settled the matter outside of court, but Madonna's album and single were prohibited in Lebanon.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2019-11-21|title=Happy Birthday Fairouz!

She also performed a concert in Las Vegas at the [[MGM Grand Arena]] in 1999 which was attended by over 16,000 spectators, mostly Arabs. Ever since, Fairuz has held sold-out concerts at the Beiteddine International Festival (Lebanon) from 2000 to 2003, [[Kuwait]] (2001), Paris (2002), the United States (2003), [[Amman]] (2004), [[Montreal]] (2005), [[Dubai]], [[Abu Dhabi]], [[Baalbeck]], [[BIEL]] (2006), [[Athens]],<ref>{{cite news |title= Haunted by her songs of love, peace |author= Raed Rafei |newspaper= Los Angeles Times |date= 15 July 2007 |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jul/15/entertainment/ca-fairuz15?pg=2 |access-date= 14 January 2010}}</ref> [[Amman]] (2007) [[Damascus]], and [[Bahrain]] (2008).

Her first album in the new millennium, ''Wala Keef'', was released in 2002.<ref>{{Citation|title=Wala Keef by Fairouz|url=https://music.apple.com/lb/album/wala-keef/723943370|language=en-gb|access-date=2020-12-13}}</ref>

On January 28, 2008, Fairuz performed at the [[Damascus Opera House]] in an emotional return to the Syrian capital, where she played the lead role in the musical ''Sah el-Nom'' (''Good Morning''), after more than two decades of absence from the country, in one of a series of events highlighting [[UNESCO]]'s designation of Damascus as the Capital of Arab Culture that year. Commenting on the event, the [[BBC]] wrote: "Every day the sun rises over Syria you hear one voice across the country – Fairuz, the legendary Lebanese singer and greatest living Arab diva". Syrian historian, [[Sami Moubayed]], said that the Syrians were thrilled about the performance and that Fairuz reminded them of the "good old days". People from all ages attended the concert and the auditorium was packed with listeners. Fairuz said that she had never seen such an audience in her life. However, her decision to perform there drew criticism from Lebanese politicians who considered Syria to be a hostile nation.<ref name="BBC Syria">{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7233601.stm | title=Lebanese diva opens Syrian hearts | publisher=BBC | date=7 February 2008 | access-date=31 January 2015 | author=Sinjab, Lina}}</ref><ref name="CSM Syria">{{cite news | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/0128/p04s02-wome.html | title=Fairouz fans angry over the diva's concert in Syria | newspaper=The Christian Science Monitor | date=28 January 2008 | access-date=31 January 2015 | author=Blanford, Nicholas}}</ref>

Fairuz's new album entitled ''[[Eh... Fi Amal]]'' was released on October 7, 2010, produced by Fairuz productions and written entirely by her son Ziad Rahbani. Two concerts took place at BIEL Center in Beirut, Lebanon, on October 7 and 8.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fairouz {{!}} Aghanyna|url=https://www.aghanyna.net/english/artists/fairouz/|access-date=2020-12-13}}</ref>

The song is a tribute for Fairouz's late husband Assi Rahbany and was released in commemoration of his anniversary. Lameen is inspired by the French song "Pour qui veille l'étoile" and was adapted into Arabic by Reema Rahbany.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2017/06/21/lebanese-icon-fayrouz-new-album-release|title=Fayrouz gives glimpse of upcoming album|date=21 June 2017|website=[[Euronews]]|access-date=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/33/271349/Arts--Culture/Music/Lebanese-icon-Fayrouz-announces-release-of-new-sin.aspx|title=Lebanese icon Fayrouz announces release of new single 'Lameen' – Music – Arts & Culture|website=[[Al-Ahram]]|access-date=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.the961.com/lameen-fairouz-released-new-song/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820223626/https://www.the961.com/lameen-fairouz-released-new-song/|url-status=dead|archive-date=20 August 2020|title=Fairouz Just Released A New Song!|date=22 June 2017|publisher=The961|access-date=10 July 2017}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Fairuz married Assi Rahbani, one of the Rahnani brothers who helped shape her singing career, on January 23, 1955.<ref name=":6" /> Fairuz and Assi Rahbani had four children: [[Ziad Rahbani|Ziad]] (born 1956), a composer, playwright and pianist; Hali (born 1958, paralyzed since early childhood after [[meningitis]]); Layal (born 1960, died in 1988 of a stroke), also a composer; and Rima (born 1965), a photographer and film director. Fairouz was born to a [[Syriac Orthodox Church|Syriac Orthodox]] family. She is of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]] faith, having converted when she married [[Assi Rahbani]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-11-22|title=Fairouz: Still going strong at 80|url=https://www.arabnews.com/offbeat/news/839486|access-date=2020-12-13|website=Arab News|language=en}}</ref> Very little is known about Fairuz'a personal life and affairs, as she is described as having a hermetic nature and separates Nouhad from Fairuz.<ref name=":1" />

==Controversies==
===2008 Damascus concert===
The 2008 concert in Damascus angered some of her fans and several Lebanese politicians who described Syria as "enemy territory in the grip of a brutal secret police force". [[Walid Jumblatt]], leader of the [[Druze]] [[Progressive Socialist Party]], accused Fairuz of "playing into the hands of Syrian intelligence services", while fellow party member [[Akram Chehayeb]] said that "those who love Lebanon do not sing for its jailers," in reference to the three-decades-long [[Syrian occupation of Lebanon]]. Even some Syrian opposition activists called on her to boycott the event as just three years prior Syria had been accused of carrying out a series of assassinations on the Lebanese.<ref name=":10">{{Cite news|date=2008-01-28|title=Fairouz fans angry over the diva's concert in Syria|work=Christian Science Monitor|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2008/0128/p04s02-wome.html|access-date=2020-12-14|issn=0882-7729}}</ref> This came amid a political crisis in Lebanon between pro-and anti-Syria factions. As well as a renewed Syrian government crackdown on dissent that same day during which several people were arrested, including opposition figure [[Riad Seif]] and twelve other activists of the anti-government [[Damascus Declaration]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Royalty Dispute May Silence Fairouz|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2010/07/30/128877303/how-a-royalty-dispute-may-silence-lebanese-star-fairouz|access-date=2020-12-13|website=NPR.org|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":6" />

A poll conducted a week before the concert by ''[[NOW News|NOW Lebanon]]'', a Lebanese web portal sympathetic to the anti-Syria [[March 14 Alliance]], showed that 67% of the respondents were opposed to Fairuz's appearance in Damascus, with one of the website's editorials saying that "this was not the moment for a musical love-in". Supporters of Fairuz counterclaimed that she has always been above politics.<ref name=":10" />  Fairuz refrained from commenting on the controversy. However, in a letter to the event's organizers, she said that the concert should be viewed from a cultural perspective, and wrote: "Damascus is not a cultural capital for this year only, but will remain a role model of art, culture and authenticity for the coming generations".She also told the head of the organizers that she felt it was a return to her second home. Syrian commentator Ayman Abdelnour said that Fairuz was performing to the Syrian people, not their rulers.  Her brother-in-law and former partner [[Mansour Rahbani]] also defended her decision to perform there, saying it was "a message of love and peace from Lebanon to Syria".<ref name="BBC Syria"/><ref name="CSM Syria"/><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-lebanon-diva-idUSL2874028520080128 | title=Lebanese diva arouses emotion, controversy in Syria | work=Reuters | date=28 January 2008 | access-date=31 January 2015 | author=Oweis, Khaled Y.}}</ref>

In 1969, Fairuz's songs were banned from the radio stations in Lebanon for six months because she refused to sing at a private concert in honour of Algerian President [[Houari Boumedienne]]. The incident only served to increase her popularity. Fairuz made it clear then and since that while always willing to sing to the public and to various countries and regions, she would never sing to any individual.<ref>{{cite web|last=Al Yafai|first=Faisal|date=7 August 2010|title=Fairuz: Lebanon's quavering voice|url=https://www.thenational.ae/uae/fairuz-lebanon-s-quavering-voice-1.529754|access-date=9 October 2020|work=[[The National (UAE)|The National]]|quote=1969: Banned from radio stations for six months after refusing to perform a private concert for the president of Algeria}}</ref>

===Lawsuits===
Since many of the Rahbanis' works were co-written by Assi's brother Mansour, in June 2010, a year after Mansour's death in January 2009, a Lebanese court banned Fairuz from singing material that involved his contributions. The issue began when Mansour's children filed a lawsuit against Fairuz when she was set to perform the song "Ya'ish Ya'ish" at the [[Casino du Liban]]. As a result, Fairuz could not perform such works without Mansour's children's permission. The court's decision led to protests around the world in response to what her fans perceived as an act of "silencing". Hundreds gathered in front of the [[National Museum of Beirut]], led by a number of Arab artists, including Egyptian actress [[Ilham Chahine]] who flew to Lebanon in order to join the sit-in. "She is a great artistic personality who has entertained millions for decades. We cannot keep silent over this humiliating attitude to her and to art and artists in general. Fairouz to me is above all laws. She is like the mother whom, even when she errs, we are eager to forgive," Chahine added. [[Ian Black (journalist)|Ian Black]] wrote on ''[[The Guardian]]'': "Outrage over her silencing has been a reminder of the extraordinary loyalty she still inspires across the region". Other reactions included a protest concert in Egypt, and a "Shame!" headline displayed by Emirati newspaper ''[[Al-Ittihad (Emirati newspaper)|Al-Ittihad]]''.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/fairouz-diva-middle-east | title=Fans lend their voices to Fairouz, the silenced diva | newspaper=The Guardian | date=29 July 2010 | access-date=31 January 2015 | author=Black, Ian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/therecord/2010/07/30/128877303/how-a-royalty-dispute-may-silence-lebanese-star-fairouz | title=Royalty Dispute May Silence Fairouz | publisher=NPR | date=30 July 2010 | access-date=31 January 2015 | author=Ganz, Jacob}}</ref>

===Alleged political affiliations===
Fairuz's son, Ziad Rahbani, sparked controversy in December 2013 during an interview with the ''Al-Ahed'' website when asked whether his mother shared his supportive stance on the political vision of [[Hassan Nasrallah]], the leader of [[Hezbollah]], a dominant but highly controversial political and military force in Lebanon. Ziad replied: "Fairuz is very fond of Sayyed Hassan [Nasrallah], although she will be displeased with me, as she was after my last television interview when I revealed some personal information and she quickly interrupted me".<ref name="Al-Monitor Nasrallah">{{cite web | url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/12/lebanon-fairouz-statement-hezbollah-nasrallah-controversy.html# | title=Famous diva's 'fondness' for Nasrallah stirs controversy | publisher=Al-Monitor | date=27 December 2013 | access-date=31 January 2015 | author=Aziz, Jean}}</ref> There were strong reactions to this statement, which went viral on social media,<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Lebanon-News/2013/Dec-21/241895-nasrallah-and-jumblatt-weigh-in-on-fairouz-fallout.ashx | title=Nasrallah and Jumblatt weigh in on Fairouz fallout | newspaper=The Daily Star | date=21 December 2013 | access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref> and the country's different media outlets did not deviate from their political stances when reacting to Ziad's words.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/dec/20/world/la-fg-wn-lebanese-singer-hezbollah-chief-20131220 | title=Lebanese singer stirs controversy with 'love' of Hezbollah chief | newspaper=The Los Angeles Times | date=20 December 2013 | access-date=1 February 2015 | author=Bulos, Nabih}}</ref> Politicians and celebrities stepped in as well, some of whom objected to affiliating Fairuz to one side of Lebanon's political divide over another, including Druze leader Walid Jumblatt who said: "Fairuz is too great to be criticized, and at the same time too great to be classified as belonging to this or that political camp". "Let us keep her in her supreme position, and not push her to something she has nothing to do with," Jumblatt added.<ref name="Al Arabiya Nasrallah">{{cite web | url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/life-style/entertainment/2013/12/27/Uproar-over-legendary-Fairuz-s-love-of-Hezbollah-chief.html | title=Uproar over legendary Fairuz's 'love' of Hezbollah chief | publisher=Al Arabiya | date=27 December 2013 | access-date=1 February 2015 | author=McNamara, Whitney}}</ref> Ziad, who claims to speak on his mother's behalf "because she prefers to remain silent", responded to his critics by saying: "Apparently it isn’t allowed in the age of strife for the princess of classy Arab art to voice love for the master of resistance".<ref name="Al Arabiya Nasrallah"/> Nasrallah, commenting on the issue during a speech, stated: "An educated highly respected thinker and artist, who may be espoused different ideologies, might disagree with you on political matters, but personally have [a] fondness for you, because of your character, conduct, sacrifices and so on. If such a person were to say that he or she liked someone, then all hell would break loose".<ref name="Al-Monitor Nasrallah"/>

==Legacy and honors==
Fairuz is the Arab world's most famous and most listened-to singer. For decades, almost all radio stations in the Arab world have been starting their morning broadcast with a Fairuz song, and her songs were continuously listened to during the war, as the people could expect to hear a patriotic melody of peace and love.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/jul/29/fairouz-diva-middle-east|title=Fans lend their voices to Fairouz, the silenced diva|first1=Ian|last1=Black|first2=Middle East|last2=editor|date=29 July 2010|via=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/iconic-fairouz-remains-most-listened-arab-singer-she-turns-80-771638|title=Iconic Fairouz remains most listened-to Arab singer as she turns 80|date=22 November 2015}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2020-09-01|title=Macron’s visit to Fairuz signifies French esteem for Lebanon’s No. 1 diva|url=https://arab.news/bw6u3|access-date=2020-12-12|website=Arab News|language=en}}</ref> ''The Guardian'' stated that "she sang the story of a Lebanon that never really existed" and "essentially helped build the identity of Lebanon, just 14 years after it became an independent country".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/04/insider-cultural-guide-beirut-beautiful-rowdy-intoxicated-mess|title=An insider's cultural guide to Beirut: 'a beautiful, rowdy, intoxicated mess'|first=Nasri|last=Atallah|date=4 January 2016|via=The Guardian}}</ref> Fairuz has always been held a high regard because, to a region divided by many conflicts and opinions, she is a symbol of unity; she was even awarded Legion of Honour at the rank of ''Commandeur'' on August 31, 2020 by French president [[Emmanuel Macron]], while he was visiting Beirut after the 2020 explosion.

Fairuz was honored in many countries such as Lebanon, Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Tunisia, the United States, Egypt and France, in which [[François Mitterrand]] awarded her the [[Order of Arts and Letters]] in 1988 and [[Jacques Chirac]] first awarded her the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1998 (''Chevalier'').<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fairuz|url=https://www.aub.edu.lb/doctorates/recipients/Pages/fairuz-profile.aspx|access-date=2020-12-14|website=www.aub.edu.lb}}</ref>

==Discography==
{{Main|Fairuz discography}}
Fairuz possesses a large repertoire of songs, sources disagree on the exact number, but it is between fifteen hundred and three thousand.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|last=Welle (www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche|title=Fairuz: Celebrated Lebanese singer turns 85 {{!}} DW {{!}} 20.11.2020|url=https://www.dw.com/en/fairuz-celebrated-lebanese-singer-turns-85/a-55673117|access-date=2020-12-14|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB}}</ref>

Around 85 Fairuz CDs, types of vinyl and cassettes have been officially released so far. Most of the songs that are featured on these albums were composed by the [[Rahbani brothers]]. Also featured are songs by Philemon Wehbe, [[Ziad Rahbani]], [[Zaki Nassif]], Mohamed Abd El Wahab, Najib Hankash and Mohamed Mohsen.

Many of Fairuz's numerous unreleased works date back to the 1950s and 1960s and were composed by the Rahbani Brothers (certain unreleased songs, the oldest of all, are by Halim el Roumi). A Fairuz album composed by Egyptian musician [[Riad Al Sunbati]] (who has worked with [[Umm Kulthum]]) was produced in 1980 but is unlikely to be released. There are also fifteen unreleased songs composed by Philemon Wehbe and 24 unreleased songs composed by Ziad Rahbani in the 1980s.

Fairuz has also released a live album on [[Folkways Records]] in 1994, entitled ''Lebanon: The Baalbek Folk Festival''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://folkways.si.edu/fairuz/lebanon-the-baalbek-folk-festival/islamica-world/music/album/smithsonian|title=Lebanon: The Baalbek Folk Festival|work=[[Folkways Records]]|access-date=February 13, 2021}}</ref>

==Performances and Persona==
Fairuz has performed in many countries around the globe including [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], France, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Netherlands,<ref name=amsterdam>{{cite news|last=Blok|first=Arthur|title=Fairuz wows Amsterdam|url=http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=286152&MID=123&PID=2|access-date=30 June 2011|newspaper=[[NOW Lebanon]]|date=27 June 2011|quote=Holland Festival organizers were literally glowing with pride as legendary singer Fairuz stepped on stage on Sunday night at Amsterdam’s Royal Theater Carré.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628014546/http://www.nowlebanon.com/NewsArticleDetails.aspx?ID=286152&MID=123&PID=2|archive-date=June 28, 2011|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Greece, Canada, United States, Mexico, [[Brazil]], [[Argentina]], Australia, Belgium, Italy, and her home country Lebanon.

During her performances, Fairuz is known to take on a very rigid and cold stance, due to her stage fright. She claims that the hierarchic nature of her performances is because she is singing as if she were praying. <ref name=":9" /><ref name=":1" /> She is also described as being incredibly reserved and modest in the way a mother would be, and embodies the Lebanese woman at home.<ref name=":1" />

==Theatrical works==
Musical plays or operettas were the cornerstone works of the Rahbani Trio, Fairuz, Assi and Mansour. The Rahbani Brothers produced 25 popular musical plays (20 with Fairuz) over more than 30 years. They were possibly the first to produce world-class Arabic musical theatre.<ref name=":6" /><ref name=":7" />

The musicals combined storyline, lyrics and dialogue, musical composition varying widely from Lebanese folkloric and rhythmic modes to classical, westernized, and oriental songs, orchestration, and the voice and acting of Fairuz. She played the lead roles alongside singers/actors [[Nasri Shamseddine]], [[Wadih El Safi]], Antoine Kerbaje, Elie Shouayri (Chouayri), Hoda (Fairuz's younger sister), William Haswani, Raja Badr, Siham Chammas (Shammas), Georgette Sayegh and many others.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fairuz {{!}} Album Discography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/fairuz-mn0000163342/discography|access-date=2020-12-13|website=AllMusic|language=en-us}}</ref><ref name=":3" />

The Rahbani plays expressed patriotism, unrequited love and nostalgia for village life, comedy, drama, philosophy, and contemporary politics. The songs performed by Fairuz as part of the plays have become immensely popular among the Lebanese and Arabs around the world.<ref name="Fairuz - her music"/>
