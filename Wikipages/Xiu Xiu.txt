'''Xiu Xiu''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|uː|ʃ|uː}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Moroz |first=Ross |url=http://www.vueweekly.com/article.php?id=2087 |title=Xiu Xiu Ch-Boogie |publisher=Vue Weekly |date=June 16, 2005 |access-date=February 1, 2008 }}</ref>) is an American [[experimental music|experimental]] band, formed in 2002 by singer-songwriter [[Jamie Stewart (musician)|Jamie Stewart]] in [[San Jose, California]]. Currently, the line-up consists of Stewart (the only constant member since formation) and Angela Seo.  The band's name comes from the film ''[[Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl]],'' which has influenced the sound of their music, according to Stewart.

== History ==

===2002–2004: Formation and early years===
[[Jamie Stewart (musician)|Jamie Stewart]] formed Xiu Xiu in 2002 after his previous band, Ten in the Swear Jar, disbanded.<ref name="Metro: No Show Joe Show"/> Stewart and Cory McCulloch continued from the previous group, and were joined by Yvonne Chen and Lauren Andrews.<ref name="Metro: Rubber Soul"/> The band's sound was characterized by its use of indigenous instruments and programmed drums in place of traditional rock instruments: harmonium, mandolin, brass bells, gongs, keyboards, and a cross between a [[guitarrón mexicano]] and a cello for bass, etc.<ref name="Metro: Rubber Soul"/>

Xiu Xiu would tour their first LP ''[[Knife Play]]'', and its successor EP, ''[[Chapel of the Chimes (EP)|Chapel of the Chimes]]'', in 2002, blending both melody and cacophony with a heavy reliance on [[percussion|percussive instrumentation]] and [[brass instrument]]ation.

Following 2002, the group would shrink in membership as Yvonne Chen left to focus on her vegan boutique ''Otsu'' and self-published magazine ''Zum'', while Cory McCulloch also stopped touring, focusing instead on producing the band's next two LPs. A personal loss would affect Xiu Xiu as well, as Jamie Stewart's father, musician and record producer [[Michael Stewart (musician)|Michael Stewart]] was found dead after an apparent suicide.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117876193.html?categoryid=25&cs=1 | work=Variety | title=Michael Stewart | date=November 18, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zoilus.com/documents/news/2004/000059.php |title=Xiu Xiu Shoo-Bop |publisher=Zoilus |date=March 11, 2004 |access-date=July 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216084649/http://www.zoilus.com/documents/news/2004/000059.php |archive-date=February 16, 2012 }}</ref> Coping with these losses, Stewart would record the group's follow-up to ''Knife Play'', 2003's ''[[A Promise (Xiu Xiu album)|A Promise]]''.

Continuing to focus on the subject matter of Jamie Stewart's personal life – as witnessed previously by ''Knife Play'' – ''A Promise'' acts like a concept record of internal despair. Consisting of ten tracks, the record was oriented towards a more or less acoustic presentation, rather than relying on the booming brass and percussion which had worked to make ''Knife Play''. However, the record did not veer from the formulated [[programming (music)|programming]] for which Stewart and McCulloch would be praised by fans and critics alike.

During this time, Stewart recorded ''[[Fag Patrol]]'', a collection of previous recorded material as well as covers of songs by [[The Smiths]] and his previous group with McCulloch, [[Ten in the Swear Jar]]. Released as a handmade CD by Rob Fisk's and Kelly Goodefisk's Free Porcupine Society, ''Fag Patrol'' was limited to only a few hundred copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/reviews/xiu-xiu/fag-patrol.htm |title=Xiu Xiu – Fag Patrol – Review |publisher=Stylus Magazine |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> In the spring of 2004, Stewart and McCulloch released what is considered by many to be the group's most accessible album, ''[[Fabulous Muscles]]''. More pop-friendly in its sound than previous releases, ''Fabulous Muscles'' boosted Xiu Xiu to new heights in terms of popularity, largely thanks to its single "I Luv the Valley OH!". The tone of the album reflected an "incredibly, incredibly violent, incredibly jarring, and difficult to take" string of events in Stewart's life.<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/> Stewart described his lyrics as "never fictional".<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/> He told ''Pitchfork'' that Xiu Xiu songs are based around five topics: family, politics, sex, love and lovelessness, suicide, and how they are connected.<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/>

With the departure of Lauren Andrews in 2003 – who wished to focus on her academic studies – Stewart was joined on stage by his "long-lost" cousin, [[Caralee McElroy]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caraleemcelroy.com/Bio.htm |title=Bio |publisher=Caraleemcelroy.com |date=December 27, 1983 |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> The two would tour relentlessly throughout that year, releasing not only the group's third LP, but also split recordings with This Song Is a Mess But So Am I and [[Bunkbed]], along with the "Fleshettes" single – which featured a rendition of the [[Ten in the Swear Jar]] track "Helsabot" by McElroy.

===2004–2010: ''La Forêt'' to ''Dear God, I Hate Myself''===
Seen as a return to Stewart's more dark and crabby demeanor, Xiu Xiu's fourth album ''[[La Forêt (album)|La Forêt]]'' alluded to a frustration which Stewart had felt throughout the process of recording the 2004 record. Centered around the topic of "horrible times in horrible lives" as well as Stewart's personal frustrations with then-U.S. President [[George W. Bush]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.junkmedia.org/index.php/25/31/index.php?i=1609 |title=Xiu Xiu : La Foret |publisher=Junkmedia |access-date=July 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405184512/http://www.junkmedia.org/index.php/25/31/index.php?i=1609 |archive-date=April 5, 2012 }}</ref> ''La Forêt'' is characterized by an altogether different sound – layered by [[mandolin]], [[Pump organ|harmonium]], [[clarinet]], cello, [[autoharp]], and [[tuba]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_M2IEAAAAMBAJ |page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_M2IEAAAAMBAJ/page/n85 72] |quote=xiu xiu + la foret + harmonium. |title=Out |via=[[Internet Archive]] |date=March 2006 |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> In addition to ''La Forêt'', Xiu Xiu would join Italian experimental group Larsen in forming XXL, which released its first LP, ''[[¡Ciaütistico!]]'', in 2005, followed later by its successor ''[[¿Spicchiology?]]'', in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://obscuresound.com/?p=1066 |title=Xiu Xiu Larsen Returns to Italy to Record Â¿Spicchiology? |publisher=Obscure Sound |date=May 22, 2007 |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> Stewart also issued formative splits throughout 2005, working with artists such as [[The Paper Chase (band)|The Paper Chase]], [[Kill Me Tomorrow]], and [[Devendra Banhart]].

[[File:Xiu xiu 20101107-001.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Jamie Stewart at a performance in Stockholm, Sweden, November 2010]]
In 2009, Stewart would break from tradition by ending his professional relationship with McCulloch. He then started recording with San Francisco-based band [[Deerhoof]]'s drummer [[Greg Saunier]] as producer for Xiu Xiu's fifth LP entitled ''[[The Air Force]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mesalove.wordpress.com/2006/07/17/xiu-xiu-jamie-stewart/ |title=Xiu Xiu – Jamie Stewart « Mesa Love |publisher=Mesalove.wordpress.com |date=July 17, 2006 |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> Saunier, who had previously worked with Stewart on ''Knife Play'', created for the record a greater [[wall of sound]] – a stark contrast to that of McCulloch's discordant attitude towards production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/scene/music/2006/09/22/arent-xiu-xiu-into-sm/ |title=Aren't Xiu (Xiu) into S&M? |publisher=Yale Daily News |date=September 22, 2006 |access-date=July 22, 2012 }}</ref> ''The Air Force'' would be supported throughout 2006 by a three piece ensemble, as Stewart and McElroy were joined by drummer/percussionist Ches Smith, who himself had previously worked with the group on ''Knife Play''. Produced by Greg Saunier, Stewart said that the album is about "making other people feel bad" instead of feeling bad oneself and the year it was released was "one of the first not dominated by personal tragedies"<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/> Its major themes are "guilt and sex as opposed to sorrow and sex".<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/> Stewart considered it their best and most consciously pop album yet. He said that the band was obsessed with Weezer's ''[[Weezer (1994 album)|Blue Album]]'' and [[The Smiths]]'s ''[[The Queen Is Dead]]'' while on tour, though the album does not reflect those albums particularly.<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/> 
''The Air Force'' also contained the band's first album-based song without vocals by Stewart – with McElroy singing "Hello From Eau Claire".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=451&fid=6&sid=17 |title=New York Foundation for the Arts |publisher=NYFA |access-date=July 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305235335/http://www.nyfa.org/level3.asp?id=451&fid=6&sid=17 |archive-date=March 5, 2012 }}</ref>

A third EP – ''[[Tu Mi Piaci]]'' ("I like you") – of songs originally recorded by acts such as [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]], [[Nedelle]], [[Big Star]], [[The Pussycat Dolls]], and [[Nina Simone]] was released in 2006, along with a collaboration with ambient artist [[Grouper (band)|Grouper]], entitled ''Creepshow''. Shortly thereafter, Xiu Xiu would record their sixth album, 2008's ''[[Women as Lovers]]''. Their longest LP to date, ''Women as Lovers'' attempts to hone the synth-pop influences of the group's sound. Stewart's and McElroy's duet with Michael Gira of [[Swans (band)|Swans]] on a cover of [[David Bowie]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "Under Pressure" is representative of this. Touring that year alongside Xiu Xiu aluminist Devin Hoff on bass, the band's second four-piece incarnation would not last long, as Hoff abruptly left the group soon after touring began.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://agitreader.com/features/xiu_xiu-9.01.html |title=The Agit Reader • Feature: Xiu Xiu |publisher=Agitreader.com |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref>

In May 2009, it was revealed that Caralee McElroy would no longer work with Xiu Xiu.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/35351-caralee-mcelroy-leaves-xiu-xiu/ |title=Caralee McElroy Leaves Xiu Xiu &#124; News |publisher=Pitchfork |date=May 15, 2009 |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Josiah |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid2=844&fid1=38631&csid1=0 |title=Caralee McElroy Leaves Xiu Xiu, Jamie Stewart Writes Haikus • News • |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=May 20, 2009 |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> Speculations ran as to what reasons McElroy had for leaving the group after five years of recording and touring, though no explanation was given other than her subsequent membership in Manhattan-based [[darkwave]] group [[Cold Cave]], which she soon after departed from in 2010. With the vacancies left by both Hoff and McElroy, Stewart and Smith recruited Angela Seo in late 2009. Thereafter, the group would begin work on its seventh LP ''[[Dear God, I Hate Myself]]'', recording in both Oakland, California as well as Durham, North Carolina. Once again shifting motifs, Xiu Xiu would this time choose to experiment with video game-based programming, using the [[Nintendo DS]] to write many of the songs which appear on their 2010 release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://popwreckoning.com/2010/05/14/interview-with-jamie-stewart-of-xiu-xiu/ |title=Interview with: Jamie Stewart of Xiu Xiu |publisher=popwreckoning |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> The music video for the song "Dear God, I Hate Myself" received attention online in 2010. The video consists of Angela Seo inducing vomiting over the course of the three-minute song, culminating with her vomiting on Stewart, who has been eating a chocolate bar during the entire video.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/media/xiu-xiu/dear-god-i-hate-myself-video-nsfw/37048/ |title=Xiu Xiu: 'Dear God I Hate Myself' (Video) (NSFW) &#124; Prefix |publisher=Prefixmag.com |access-date=July 22, 2012}}</ref> Seo and Stewart have defended the video online and in interviews, stating that the video illustrates the subject of the song in an extreme and visceral fashion.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In an email sent to fans on January 28, 2013, Xiu Xiu announced that "Ches Smith, [[Mary Halvorson]], [[Tim Berne]], [[Tony Malaby]], [[Andrea Parkins]] and Jamie Stewart just finished recording an album in NYC of free jazz and art song versions of all [[Nina Simone]] songs." The album, ''[[Nina (Xiu Xiu album)|Nina]]'', was released on [[Graveface Records]] on December 3, 2013.

In the same email, Xiu Xiu also announced that a new Xiu Xiu album was being made. Xiu Xiu said that it is possible that it will be named ''[[Angel Guts: Red Classroom (album)|Angel Guts: Red Classroom]]'' and that "it will be a mean, tight hearted, blackness of [[Einstürzende Neubauten|Neubauten]] vs [[Suicide (band)|Suicide]] vs [[Nico]]." Angel Guts: Red Classroom was released February 2014.

== Name and musical style ==
The band's name comes from the film ''[[Xiu Xiu: The Sent Down Girl]]''. The band found its first tracks to match the "rotten realness" spirit of the film, "that sometimes life turns out with a worst possible case scenario".<ref name="Pitchfork 2003" /> Stewart said [[Tracy Chapman]]'s "[[Fast Car]]", which Xiu Xiu covered on ''[[A Promise (Xiu Xiu album)|A Promise]]'', had a similar theme.<ref name="Pitchfork 2003" />

Stewart has added that the band was a product of San Jose pirate radio stations that played [[house music|house]], [[hi-NRG]], [[freestyle music|freestyle]], and [[techno]], which Stewart considered unpretentious, plain, heartbroken, clear, and based around dancing away sadness. He said he wrote his first Xiu Xiu song after leaving a San Jose dance club alone on a Christmas night: "Xiu Xiu came from feeling stupid and lonely and then wanting to dance it away, but having the club and its music only magnify that stupid and lonely feeling."<ref name="Pitchfork 2006" /> At the time of ''A Promise'', Stewart said that he was influenced by [[gamelan]] and Japanese and Korean folk music, and had been listening to contemporary classical and "gay dance music".<ref name="Pitchfork 2003" />

=== Live performances ===
In 2003, Stewart told Pitchfork that the band's live shows were starkly different from the recorded material. He said this was largely due to the technical limitations of being able to reproduce the way it was recorded. In their live shows, the band increased the intensity of their loud rock parts, though Stewart reported their set to be half "louder, more dance-y stuff" and half "really quiet stuff".<ref name="Pitchfork 2003" /> He said the latter was sometimes at odds with the type of venues they played.<ref name="Pitchfork 2003" />

== Reception ==

''Metro Silicon Valley''{{'}}s David Espinoza likened Stewart to an explorer charting new territories of sound in 2001 as he started Xiu Xiu.<ref name="Metro: Rubber Soul"/> He compared Stewart's voice to a combination of [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]]'s fragility and ''[[The Downward Spiral]]''-era [[Trent Reznor]]'s anger, and noted Stewart's deliberate and considered choices towards developing the band's tone in light of the disparate wackiness of the individual instruments.<ref name="Metro: Rubber Soul"/>

Brandon Stosuy of ''Pitchfork'' noted a "continual poetic and romantic beauty" behind "the violence" in Stewart's lyrics.<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/> He wrote that the band inspired fandom of the kind where teenage girls ask for Stewart's autograph.<ref name="Pitchfork 2006"/>
