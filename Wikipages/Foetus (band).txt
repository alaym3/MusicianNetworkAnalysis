'''Foetus''' is a solo musical project of Australian musician [[JG Thirlwell]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin |editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]] |date=1997 |edition=concise |isbn=1-85227-745-9 |page=475}}</ref> The project has had many similar names, each including the word 'Foetus'.{{ref|aliases|note}} The "members" of the project are aliases of Thirlwell; they include Frank Want, Phillip Toss, and [[Clint Ruin]]. Thirlwell occasionally collaborates with other artists, but does not consider them to be members of Foetus.

In 1981, after the breakup of [[PragVEC]], Thirlwell started his own solo music project under the name of 'Foetus Under Glass'. After the album ''[[Thaw (Foetus album)|Thaw]]'', Thirlwell stopped changing the name; thereafter it remained simply 'Foetus'.

In November 1983, Foetus undertook a tour with [[Marc Almond]], [[Nick Cave]] and [[Lydia Lunch]] in the quickly dissolved 'partnership' known as [[The Immaculate Consumptive]].<ref name="Larkin"/> He has also appeared on albums recorded by [[The The]], [[Einsturzende Neubauten]], [[Nurse With Wound]] and Anne Hogan.<ref name="Larkin"/>

In October 1985, Thirlwell made the album ''[[Nail (album)|Nail]]'', which became the most popular Foetus album of all time. 

''[[Gash (Foetus album)|Gash]]'' was issued in 1995, which led to acknowledgment from music journalists of Foetus's role in the development of [[industrial music]].<ref name="Larkin"/>

==Conceptual themes==
All full-length Foetus album titles are four-letter, one-[[syllable]] words, often with multiple connotations.<ref name="Larkin"/>

The artwork of Foetus releases shows a deliberate progression of colour: the earliest releases are black-and-white, with the addition of red on the ''[[Deaf (album)|Deaf]]'' album, and further addition of yellow on ''[[Nail (album)|Nail]]''. Full-colour art was introduced on ''[[Gash (Foetus album)|Gash]]''.<ref>{{cite journal |author=The Pizz |title=Locomotion Abortion: The Foetus Interview |url=http://now-im-sane.tumblr.com/post/98730959923/vomiting-loco-motion-abortion-the-foetus |work=Axcess Magazine |volume=3 |issue=4 |page=99 |date=1995}}</ref> Beginning with ''[[Flow (Foetus album)|Flow]]'', the artwork of primary albums reverted to black/white/red, although other releases continue in full colour.
