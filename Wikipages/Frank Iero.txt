"Last but not least, North Arlington's Queen of Peace High School recently produced Frank Iero, rhythm guitarist and backup vocalist for the pop punkemo band My Chemical Romance."</ref> He went to [[Rutgers University]] on a scholarship, but dropped out to go on tour with [[My Chemical Romance]].

Iero's parents split when he was young and he grew up living with his mother, who lent out her basement to her son's many band practices; his father and grandfather were musicians and both were big influences on Iero when he was young. His father urged him to play drums, but Iero later began playing the guitar.

==Music career==

===Early bands and Pencey Prep (1997–2002)===
Frank started playing in local bands on the [[New Jersey]] punk scene when aged 11. Before joining [[My Chemical Romance]] he served as frontman for the punk band [[Pencey Prep]]. The band released an album, ''[[Heartbreak in Stereo]]'', on the independent Eyeball Records before disbanding. Whilst playing with Pencey Prep, he became friends with [[Gerard Way]] and the other My Chemical Romance members, became a fan of their original demo and helped them get their first shows. After his band broke up, Frank played in several bands, including I Am A Graveyard, Hybrid, Sector 12, and [[Give Up the Ghost (band)|American Nightmare]] before being offered the slot of rhythm guitar in [[My Chemical Romance]].

===My Chemical Romance (2002–2013)===
{{Main|My Chemical Romance}}
Iero joined My Chemical Romance in 2002 and was featured on two tracks, "[[Honey, This Mirror Isn't Big Enough for the Two of Us]]" and "Early Sunsets Over Monroeville", on their debut album ''[[I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love]]''. Iero performed on the band's second studio album ''[[Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge]]'', released on June 8, 2004. My Chemical Romance released their third studio album, ''[[The Black Parade]]'', on October 24, 2006. My Chemical Romance's fourth and final studio album ''[[Danger Days: The True Lives of the Fabulous Killjoys]]'' was released on November 22, 2010. The band announced their breakup on March 22, 2013.

===Leathermouth and side projects (2007–2016)===
Iero fronted the [[hardcore punk]] quintet, [[Leathermouth]], who released their debut album ''[[XO (Leathermouth album)|XO]]'' in January 2009, on [[Epitaph Records]]. The band split later in 2010. He is involved in a tribute band to [[The Cure]] named The Love Cats, after the song of the same name, and played bass with [[Reggie and the Full Effect]] on their farewell tour. His first solo song ''This Song Is A Curse'' was released as a bonus track on the official soundtrack to the [[Tim Burton]] film, ''[[Frankenweenie (2012 film)|Frankenweenie]]''. He later posted an anti-Xmas track he recorded as a joke in 15 minutes, and followed that up with a cover of the song '[[The Ronettes#"Be My Baby"|Be My Baby]]', originally made famous by [[The Ronettes]].

On December 7, 2010, Iero left the record company Skeleton Crew that he and his wife had co-founded in order to concentrate on his family and his music with [[My Chemical Romance]], stating that although he would have loved to carry on, he could not juggle his career with the band, the new additions to his family (newborn daughters), and co-running a business .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://skeletoncrewonline.com/forum/index.php?topic=3512.0 |title=The Leading Skeleton Crew Online Site on the Net |publisher=SkeletonCrewOnline.com |access-date=2014-06-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301113140/http://skeletoncrewonline.com/forum/index.php?topic=3512.0 |archive-date=March 1, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He was a judge for the 7th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2008.asp |title=7th Annual Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |access-date=November 4, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306153750/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2008.asp |archive-date=March 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>

In early 2013 Iero and [[James Dewees]] announced that they were working on a new project, a [[digital hardcore]] act called [[Death Spells]]. They also announced a tour supporting [[Mindless Self Indulgence]] and a performance at the Skate and Surf Festival in New Jersey. Starting a week before the Mindless Self Indulgence tour, Death Spells posted a short demo of a new song each night at midnight, culminating this with their first full single ''Where Are My Fucking Pills?'' and an accompanying music video.<ref>{{cite web| last = Whitt| first = Cassie| title = Death Spells (Frank Iero and James Dewees) release video for 'Where Are My Fucking Pills?'| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = April 8, 2013| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/death_spells_frank_iero_and_james_dewees_release_video_for_where_are_my_fuc| access-date = November 22, 2013| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203053337/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/death_spells_frank_iero_and_james_dewees_release_video_for_where_are_my_fuc| archive-date = December 3, 2013| df = mdy-all}}</ref> A full-length album was expected to be released in late 2013<ref>{{cite web| last = Whitt| first = Cassie| title = 'The plan is to have a Death Spells release out this year' – Frank Iero on post-My Chem projects| work = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| date = June 3, 2013| url = http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_plan_is_to_have_a_death_spells_release_out_this_year_frank_iero_on_post| access-date = November 22, 2013| url-status = live| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131203070424/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_plan_is_to_have_a_death_spells_release_out_this_year_frank_iero_on_post| archive-date = December 3, 2013| df = mdy-all}}</ref> but was delayed until 2016, when their album ''Nothing Above, Nothing Below'' was released on July 29th of that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/frank_iero_and_james_dewees_bring_catharsis_with_death_spells_debut_lp/|title=Frank Iero and James Dewees bring catharsis with Death Spells' debut LP|last=Pettigrew|first=Jason|date=2016-06-26|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref>

==Equipment==
In the earlier days of My Chemical Romance, Iero mainly used Gibson SG's & [[Epiphone]] [[Les Paul (guitar)|Les Paul guitars]] (most notably his white Les Paul nicknamed 'Pansy' which proved popular amongst his fans but has since been broken while onstage) and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] amps.

On October 13, 2016 Iero was injured in a motor vehicle accident. As he and his band unloaded their van for a show in [[Sydney]], Australia, a passenger bus with no passengers hit them. Iero was dragged about 10 feet along the curb by the bus and credits "an enormous rucksack" for saving his life that day. He canceled all remaining 2016 shows, and would later speak about that day saying "It's incredible to me that we're all still alive. No one that witnessed the accident thought that we would be."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/frank_iero_opens_up_on_accident_for_first_time_its_incredible_to_me_that_we|title=Frank Iero opens up on accident for first time: "It's incredible to me that we're all still alive" - News - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|date=January 7, 2017|language=en|access-date=2017-06-03|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510085021/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/frank_iero_opens_up_on_accident_for_first_time_its_incredible_to_me_that_we|archive-date=May 10, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/frank-iero-cancels-tour-bus-crash-1639826|title=Frank Iero: Ex-My Chemical Romance star cancels tour following bus crash - NME|date=2016-10-18|work=NME|access-date=2017-06-03|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170221051918/http://www.nme.com/news/frank-iero-cancels-tour-bus-crash-1639826|archive-date=February 21, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
