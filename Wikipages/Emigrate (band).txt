'''Emigrate''' is an American [[industrial metal]] band based in New York City, led by German [[Richard Kruspe]], the lead guitarist of the [[Neue Deutsche Härte]] band [[Rammstein]].

== History ==
[[File:EmigrateLogo.svg|thumb|upright|The band's logo]]
Kruspe started the band in 2005, writing songs with ex-wife [[Caron Bernstein]], when Rammstein decided to take time off from touring and recording. Kruspe has previously stated that the idea for Emigrate came to him around Rammstein's ''[[Mutter (album)|Mutter]]'' era.

On September 5, 2006, members of the Rammstein.de newsletter were sent an invitation to the Emigrate newsletter and given the chance to download the song "Wake Up", a sneak peek of the upcoming album. Three song samples were also posted on Emigrate's website: "My World", "Babe", and "Temptation". Fans voted "Babe" as being their favorite, and newsletter recipients were allowed to download "Babe" in its entirety starting November 29, 2006.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pilgrim-management.de/Emigrate/ | title=Pilgrim Management – Emigrate | access-date=November 29, 2006 }}</ref> Babe is the only one of these songs where the subject matter, a parent's unconditional love for their child, is not Bernstein's point of view, as she didn't have any children at the time. Kruspe then explained exactly how he felt and she turned his feelings into lyrics. As opposed to "My World" which is entirely about her feelings of her life as it related to her world. On May 21, 2007, Emigrate's official website opened and "My World" was made available for download in its entirety to newsletter subscribers.

The video for "My World" has been released and can be viewed on the official website. The video was also included on the limited edition release of the album Emigrate. In addition to the video, "My World" is featured on the soundtracks to the third Resident Evil movie, ''[[Resident Evil: Extinction]]'' and ''[[True Confessions of a Hollywood Starlet]]''. The soundtracks to the previous two movies contained "Halleluja" and "Mein Teil" from Rammstein, respectively. On July 27, 2007, Kruspe made an appearance on [[Bruce Dickinson]]'s rock show on BBC.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.herzeleid.com | title=Herzeleid.com | access-date=June 8, 2007 }}</ref> A video for "[[New York City (Emigrate song)|New York City]]" has been released. Kruspe then left the Emigrate project aside due to Rammstein reuniting in the fall of 2007 to work on their new album ''[[Liebe ist für alle da]]'' which was released in October 2009, and also to take part in the subsequent Rammstein tour.

Joe Letz, who had appeared in the video for "My World", updated the Emigrate [[Facebook]] page on June 24, 2011, stating that Kruspe had been working on a new record.

On December 5, 2012, an announcement posted on the Emigrate Facebook page announced that demos were being recorded and reviewed, and studio time was being set up in January 2013 to begin official recording of an untitled second album.

In January 2013, Kruspe stated via the Emigrate Facebook page that drums were beginning to be mixed for the new record.

In January 2014, Kruspe, on the Emigrate Facebook page, posted that twenty tracks had been recorded for Emigrate and that mixing would be performed in Los Angeles, California, alongside Ben Grosse, with a projected release in the summer of 2014. On March 7, 2014, Kruspe announced the second album was complete and he is departing back to Berlin.

On July 22, 2014, a post was made to Emigrate's official Facebook page with a teaser trailer to Emigrate's new album, titled ''[[Silent So Long]]'' and an official release date of October 17, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rammstein Guitarist's Emigrate: More 'Silent So Long' Album Details Revealed|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/rammstein-guitarists-emigrate-more-silent-so-long-album-details-revealed/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=September 13, 2014|date=August 28, 2014}}</ref>
