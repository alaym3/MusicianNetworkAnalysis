The '''Municipal Revenues Collection Center''' &mdash;{{lang-es|Centro de Recaudación de Ingresos Municipales}} ('''CRIM''')&mdash; is the [[revenue service]] of the [[municipalities of Puerto Rico]]. The center notifies, taxes, collects, receives, and distributes public funds stemming from [[property tax]]es, from state subsidies, and from [[Puerto Rico Lottery|the electronic lottery]].<ref name="que-es-el-crim">{{cite web |url=https://www.crimpr.net/crimdnn/es-es/El-Crim |title=¿Qué es el CRIM? |language=Spanish |publisher=CRIM }}</ref> It is also responsible for the [[cadastre]] of [[real estate in Puerto Rico|real estate in each municipality]].<ref name="que-es-el-crim" />

The agency is governed by a [[board of trustees]] which changes every four or eight years [[political party strength in Puerto Rico|whenever a political party gains power]]. Since the center's ultimate authority is a state legislation rather than a constitutional provision, once a political party rises to power under a [[government trifecta]], said incumbent party amends the legislation governing the center in order to change its board. Once a new board is settled in, one of its first resolutions is to appoint a new executive director. This constant back and forth effectively makes the center a highly politicized tool rather than a resource for the people of Puerto Rico and, consequently, changes the vision, strategy, and plans of the center every four or eight years according to the political party in power.
