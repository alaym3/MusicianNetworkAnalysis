'''Paolo Conte''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpaːolo ˈkonte}}; born 6 January 1937) is an Italian singer, pianist, composer, and lawyer notable for his grainy, resonant voice. His compositions are evocative of Italian and Mediterranean sounds, as well as of jazz music and South American atmospheres.

==Career==
Paolo Conte was born in [[Asti]], [[Piedmont]]. His parents were avid jazz fans and Conte and his younger brother Giorgio spent their formative years listening to a lot of early jazz and blues recordings. After obtaining a law degree at the University of Parma, Conte started working as an assistant solicitor with his father, simultaneously pursuing his musical studies. He learned to play the trombone, the vibraphone and the piano,<ref>https://www.repubblica.it/spettacoli/musica/2017/01/05/news/paolo_conte_80_anni-155323260/?refresh_ce</ref> and formed a jazz band with his brother on guitar. Conte's skill for composing music and original arrangements was noted by music producer Lilli Greco, who paired Conte with lyricist [[Vito Pallavicini]]. They wrote songs for [[Adriano Celentano]] ("[[Azzurro]]", 1968), [[Caterina Caselli]] ("Insieme a te non ci sto più", 1968), [[Fausto Leali]] ("Deborah", 1968) and [[Enzo Jannacci]] ("Messico e nuvole", 1970). In 1974 Conte recorded his first album, ''Paolo Conte''. The following year, he released another eponymous album. Following a series of well-received shows at Club Tenco in [[Sanremo]] in 1976 and the commercial success of his third album, 'Un gelato al limon', Conte concentrated almost exclusively on his solo career.

Some of Conte's most popular songs have been used as film soundtracks, including "Come Di" in ''[[I Am David]]'' (2003) and ''[[Mickey Blue Eyes]]'' (1999), "Via con me" in ''[[French Kiss (1995 film)|French Kiss]]'' (1995), ''[[Mostly Martha (film)|Mostly Martha]]'' (2001) and ''[[Welcome to Collinwood]]'' (2002). In addition, Conte's song "L’orchestrina" is featured during the end credits for episodes 3 and 4 of the television series ''[[The New Pope]]'' (2020)''.'' In 1997 Conte won the [[Nastro d'Argento for Best Score]] for the film ''[[La freccia azzurra]]''.

==Awards==
On 24 March 1999, Paolo Conte was awarded with the [[Knight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]],<ref>[http://www.quirinale.it/elementi/DettaglioOnorificenze.aspx?decorato=12048|title=CKnight Grand Cross of the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic]</ref> by President [[Giorgio Napolitano]] for his "outstanding cultural achievements".
