==Career==

===1990s: Early years and "Sandstorm"===
{{See also|Sandstorm (instrumental)}}
Toni-Ville Henrik Virtanen was born on July 17, 1975 in the [[Finland|Finnish]] village of [[Hinnerjoki]] in [[Eura]].<ref name="sakerochannel"/><ref name="sanaboutartists"/> Virtanen started his career as a musician while studying at [[Turku Polytechnic]], making music using his PC's [[Music tracker|tracker software]].<ref name="salfaq"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.findance.sci.fi/interviews/darude/darudee.html|title=Darude Interview|access-date=December 4, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010110151700/http://www.findance.sci.fi/interviews/darude/darudee.html|archive-date=January 10, 2001|url-status=dead}}</ref> As his interest in music production rapidly grew, he moved on to more serious production techniques.<ref name="salfaq"/><ref name="danceabout"/> While at a classmate's party, Virtanen played the song "Rude Boy" (written by [[Sweden|Swedish]] artist [[Leila K]]) several times in a row. This earned him the nickname "Rude Boy," which gradually morphed into "Da Rude" and then "Darude".<ref name="danceabout"/> Active in the Finnish music [[trance music|trance]] and [[house music|house]] scene since 1995,<ref name="sakerochannel"/> Virtanen continued producing music into the 1990s. He began occasionally releasing demos to radio stations beginning in 1997, and offering his music for download on [[MP3.com]], making him an early adopter of online file sharing for music promotion.<ref name="davepeacrce"/>

In 1999, he gave a demo for the track "[[Sandstorm (instrumental)|Sandstorm]]" to his producer, [[JS16]] (Jaakko Salovaara). Virtanen signed on with JS16's 16 Inch Records label, and shortly thereafter, "Sandstorm" was released as a single.<ref name="davepeacrce"/> "Sandstorm" was a hit internationally, selling platinum<ref name="latinumdarude"/> and holding the No. 1 spot on the Finnish Dance Chart for seventeen consecutive weeks. After becoming the No. 3 single in the [[United Kingdom]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> (becoming the first record by a Finnish artist to do so), "Sandstorm" eventually sold 2 million units worldwide, and was the world's biggest selling [[12-inch single]] in 2000.<ref name="danceabout"/> The song went on to be widely [[Sandstorm (Darude composition)|featured in the media]], particularly at sporting events and on soundtracks for video games and television shows. Various videos and live streams of "Sandstorm" had gathered some 60 million hits by December 2014,<ref name="sagakweri"/> and in October 2015, the track achieved platinum sales status in the UK as it surpassed 600,000 sales in the UK.<ref name="latinumdarude"/>

His first live gig was on December 5, 1999 in [[Tampere, Finland]].<ref name="sanaboutartists"/>

{{See also|Before the Storm (Darude album)|Rush (Darude album)}}

Darude's debut studio album ''Before the Storm'' was produced by [[JS16]] (Jaakko Salovaara), and features two of JS16's remixes.<ref name="befremusic"/> The album includes several singles, including "Sandstorm."<ref name="befremusic"/> The second single "[[Feel the Beat]]" had replicated the success of "Sandstorm", reaching No. 1 on the [[Finland's Official List|singles charts in Finland]] for 2 weeks and No. 5 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> ''Before the Storm'' was released on September 5, 2000 and sold 800,000 copies worldwide,<ref name="sakerochannel"/> earning Darude three Finnish Grammy awards.<ref name="sakerochannel"/> It also peaked on a number of charts, including No. 1 on [[Finland's Official List]] for albums,<ref name="finnishcharts"/> No. 6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Dance/Electronic Albums]] chart<ref name="usdancealbumsa"/> and No. 11 on the US [[Independent Albums]] chart.<ref name="indiealbumsbill"/> It also charted at No. 9 in [[Sweden]],<ref name="swedarude"/> No. 14 in [[Norway]],<ref name="norwegiandardue"/> and No. 18 in [[Canada]], among other rankings.<ref name="canadadarude"/> Shortly after the album's release, Darude created a vocal edit of "Out of Control", and released it as a single; "[[Out of Control (Back for More)]]". This single also charted in major countries and was re-released on several editions of the album.<ref>{{cite web|title="Out of Control (Back For More)" UK Chart History|work=[[Official Charts Company]]|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/out-of-control-(back-for-more)|access-date=November 3, 2017}}</ref>

Darude began a world tour in 2001, releasing ''Before the Storm: Australian Tour Edition'' in the process. 2002 saw the release of ''Before the Storm: Special Edition'', featuring a collection of remixes of Darude's work.<ref name="samdarudeitunes"/>

After releasing the singles "Music" and "[[Next to You (Darude song)|Next to You]]" in early 2003, in July of that year both tracks were included on Darude's second album, ''[[Rush (Darude album)|Rush]]''. The album reached No. 11 on the ''Billboard'' [[Top Electronic Albums]] chart<ref name="sajrush"/> and No. 4 on [[The Official Finnish Charts|weekly album chart in Finland]],<ref name="finnishcharts"/> while "Next to You" charted at No. 1 on the Finnish singles chart. MacKenzie Wilson of [[Allmusic]] criticized the lack of variety between tracks but praised the release in general, writing that Darude "builds upon the dynamics of ''[[Before the Storm (Darude album)|Before the Storm]]'', raises the pressure, and fuels the flame for an electrifying dozen-track set. Darude's talent in keeping the energy at an elevated level without losing touch with the album's overall ambience is what makes him a star and an integral part of the new-millennium dance scene. His classy of mix of techno and trance is perfected into a fashionably slick spiral of synthesized heat."<ref name="sajrush"/> After the release of ''Rush'' Darude maintained a heavy touring schedule, particularly the United States and Eastern Europe.<ref name="sapraa"/>

===2007–12: ''Label This!'' and EnMass Music===
[[File:Darude in Toronto boxingday 2007.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Darude in [[Toronto]], 2007]]
{{Main|Label This!}}

Released on October 24, 2007 in Finland and on October 27 in Europe,<ref name="saglabelthisreview"/> the American edition was released in 2008, with the notable inclusion of Darude's newest single, "[[I Ran (So Far Away)#Cover versions|I Ran (So Far Away)]]" featuring [[Blake Lewis]], as the third track on the album.<ref name="sahlabelthisallmusic"/> The album did not chart as high as Darude's two previous album releases, though [[Gawker]] wrote that the album's single "In the Darkness" "is a floating, gossamer piece of trance music of the kind [[AraabMuzik]] spun into such magic on ''[[Electronic Dream]]''. Like '[[Sandstorm (Darude composition)|Sandstorm]],' it's tightly composed, easy to dance to, and has a soaring, undeniable hook."<ref name="sagakweri"/>
 
Darude was ranked No. 96 on the DJ List as of December 11, 2010<ref name="djlistrankone"/> and No. 314 in the [[DJ Mag]] Top 100.<ref name="djslisranktwo"/> He has also recently completed remixes for artists such as [[ATB]] and [[The Thrillseekers]], with radio play from [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] personalities such as [[Pete Tong]], [[Judge Jules]], [[Ferry Corsten]], and [[Paul Oakenfold]].<ref name="sanaboutartists"/> Darude co-founded the record label EnMass Music in 2011.<ref name="sakerochannel"/> Through EnMass Music, Darude released a DJ mix compilation titled ''Salmiakki Sessions Vol. 1'' on December 20, 2011. The compilation is a reflection of his namesake radio mix show, and includes ten of his recent remix productions and eight of his track redone by Finnish artists and producers. Five of the tracks are previously unreleased exclusives for the compilation.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} He took part in a label showcase for EnMasse in Amsterdam in October 2012.<ref name="sapraa"/>

Darude continued to tour into 2013, performing that year at the Groove Cruise out of Miami and playing two days of [[Tomorrowland]] in July 2014 in Belgium.<ref name="sapraa"/> In March 2015 he performed at [[Future Music Festival]] in Australia, playing at all five festival dates in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, also playing a variety of sideshows at clubs as part of the festival.<ref name="saofuture"/>

[[File:Darude tour picture in 2015.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Darude performing at [[Future Music Festival]] in Perth in 2015.]]
Darude's most recent studio album, ''[[Moments (Darude album)|Moments]]'', was his first full-length release in eight years.<ref name="sacfirstend"/> Guest artists included [[Caater]] and string band [[Apocalyptica]], among others. The lead single from the album, "Beautiful Alien," had previously charted at No. 1 on the Finnish iTunes charts, with a music video released as well in March 2015.<ref name="sabmomdj"/> ''Moments'' was officially released on August 14, 2015 through [[Warner Music|Warner Music Finland]] in Europe<ref name="itunesmomentseurope"/><ref name="itunesmomentsuk"/> and overseas.<ref name="itunesmomentsjapan"/>

The album blends genres such as [[Electro (music)|electro]], [[progressive house]],<ref name="sadessentials"/> and We Rave You wrote that "Darude's ability is once again proven filling the spectrum from [[big room house|big-room]] to trance to [[dubstep]]-infused depth."<ref name="sahiatusf"/> The album's mixing of genres was generally well-received,<ref name="saemixing"/> and [[Dancing Astronaut]] praised the release, writing that "Darude’s return is a clear departure from what once defined him. In ''Moments'', he steps outside the proverbial EDM box by toying around with a multitude of different styles, several of which appear simultaneously in each track."<ref name="sacfirstend"/> YourEDM opined that the album was "gorgeous," explaining that it "features a wide variety of influences and sounds" with "great production, atmospheres, and melodies riding alongside quaintly catchy vocals."<ref name="saayouredmmoments"/>

Shortly following the album's release in September 2015, Darude embarked on a ten date tour of the United States and Canada, culminating in a performance at the inaugural TwitchCon, a gaming and tech convention organised by video streaming platform [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] and held in [[San Francisco]] on September 25 and 26, 2015. With over 20,000 attendees over the weekend, Darude appeared as the headline DJ at the official afterparty, held in the [[Bill Graham Civic Auditorium]] on September 26, 2015, and also featuring a performance from [[deadmau5]].<ref name="rafterparty"/> In the run up to the event, Darude appeared as a guest in the deadmau5 Coffee Run series, chatting to the Canadian DJ about various topics while being driven in deadmau5's [[Lamborghini Huracán]] supercar. deadmau5 noted that "You [Darude] and a very select few others are responsible for the influx of electronic music into North America. It was 'Sandstorm' – I'm totally being serious... that's what all the clubs were hitting on. That's the first time [electronic music] became less 'underground and cool'... there wasn't anything before that".<ref name="runsotrm"/>
