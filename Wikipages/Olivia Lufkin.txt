'''Olivia Lufkin''' (born December 9, 1979), professionally known as '''Olivia''', is a [[Japanese Americans|Japanese-American]] bilingual singer and songwriter.<ref name="Oricon Profile">[http://www.oricon.co.jp/artists/18547/ Oricon Profile] Retrieved November 09 2007</ref> She was born in Japan to the daughter of a [[Japan]]ese mother and an [[United States|American]] father.<ref>{{cite news|title=English interview "OLIVIA's Birthday Interview"|date=2009-08-12|url=https://www.jame-world.com/en/article/75692-olivia-s-birthday-interview.html}}</ref> Her two younger siblings are Jeffrey Lufkin, a [[musician]] she regularly collaborates with and [[Caroline Lufkin]], an [[independent music|independent]] [[musician]]. Lufkin began her solo career after singing in the Japanese girl group, [[D&D (band)|D&D]]. She gained mainstream success in 2006 after creating songs for the fictional band ''Trapnest'' under the alias of ''Olivia Inspi' Reira (Trapnest).'' The songs were used for the popular anime adaptation of ''[[Nana (manga)|Nana]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Olivia Profile|website= Official Website Profile Information|publisher = [[Avex Group|Avex Entertainment]]|url= https://www.avexnet.or.jp/olivia/profile/|language= ja|access-date=July 15, 2017}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Lufkin was born in [[Naha]], [[Okinawa Prefecture]]. In 1982, she moved to [[San Diego]], [[California]], then back to Okinawa. Olivia later moved to [[North Carolina]] for two years before returning to [[Okinawa Island|Okinawa]]. 

== Career ==
Olivia was discovered by the director of "Rising Productions" ([[Vision Factory]]) while attending the [[Okinawa Actors' School]], subsequently signing to [[Avex Trax]] as part of the [[Japanese idol]] group [[D&D (band)|D&D]]. Producer [[Tetsuya Komuro]] heard of Olivia one day and decided that she would be perfect for a project he was planning along with [[Jean Michel Jarre]]. The project was to create the theme song for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] entitled ''[[Together Now]]''. The single was released a month after D&D's first and only album. It was then decided that D&D would separate into two groups: 'Olivia' as Olivia's solo-project and Aya & Chika as Aya & Chika from D&D.<ref name="J!-ENT Interviews Olivia">[http://nt2099.com/INTERVIEWS/OLIVIA/olivia.pdf J!-ENT Interviews Olivia] Retrieved December 09 2006</ref>

=== 1999–2002: Solo artist ===
Her first single, "[[I.L.Y. (Yokubō)]]," had a driving [[pop rock]] sound. While she did not write her first two singles, which were composed and produced by [[T2ya]], she wrote her third single, "[[Dear Angel]]" and most of her singles since then.

In 1999 and 2000, Olivia released six singles, all with a pop-rock sound.<ref name="Olivia biography">[http://www.olivialufkinonline.com/biography.php?lang=en Olivia biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009100945/http://www.olivialufkinonline.com/biography.php?lang=en |date=2007-10-09 }} Retrieved November 09 2007</ref> Toward the end of 2000, she released her first solo album, ''[[Synchronicity (Olivia Lufkin album)|Synchronicity]]'', which contained all singles released to date, five new tracks and one bonus track. It would peak at number twenty on the [[Oricon|Oricon Charts]].

After a hiatus of more than a year, Olivia began to take control of her career, releasing her seventh single "[[Sea Me]]" on December 12, 2001. This single marks her switch to one of [[Avex Trax]]'s sub-labels, [[Cutting Edge (record label)|Cutting Edge]], from which she continues to release singles and albums.<ref name="Olivia profile">[http://www.avexnet.or.jp/olivia/profile/ Olivia profile] Retrieved November 09 2007</ref> Her releases became increasingly rare and sporadic thereafter, with a [[Video Clips (Olivia Lufkin album)|Video Clips Collection]] appearing four months later.

Olivia's next single, "Into the Stars," was planned to be released in July 2002 with an album at the end of the year. However, plans were changed as the single was postponed until September. The album release was similarly delayed.

=== 2003–2004: New style ===
2003 saw a complete style change and an onslaught of mini-albums as she began a series of collaborations with her brother, Jeffrey Lufkin. During this time, her music became considerably darker in both style and lyrical content. Instead of singles, four mini-albums were released exclusively through [https://web.archive.org/web/20090701023018/http://www.towerrecords.co.jp/sitemap/CSfSearchResults.jsp?keyword=ArtistId&SEARCH_GENRE=ALL&entry=360328&GOODS_SORT_CD=101 Tower Records Japan] in [[Shibuya, Tokyo]]. These included: ''[[Internal Bleeding Strawberry]]'', ''[[Merry&Hell Go Round]],'' ''[[Comatose Bunny Butcher]]'' and ''[[The Return of the Chlorophyll Bunny]].''<ref name="Olivia @allmusic">[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p863036|pure_url=yes}} Olivia @allmusic] Retrieved November 09 2007</ref>

Alongside this, Olivia decided to launch a rare-items fashion label called ''Black Daisy Ville'' with her friend [[Friedia Niimura]] (Rin Kozue). This fashion line continued until the summer of 2004 featuring a line of clothes and accessories. Friedia later moved to the United States and the line discontinued.

In 2004, Olivia released her second album ''[[The Lost Lolli]]''. This album primarily featured the best material from her four mini-albums and introduced two new tracks, "Alone in Our Castle" and "Fake Flowers" as well as two re-arrangements. The album was released nationwide with a limited first press version available at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090701023018/http://www.towerrecords.co.jp/sitemap/CSfSearchResults.jsp?keyword=ArtistId&SEARCH_GENRE=ALL&entry=360328&GOODS_SORT_CD=101 Tower Records Japan]. "SpiderSpins (Lost Lolli Mix)" would be used as a promotional radio single and video for the release. ''The Lost Lolli'' would only peak at #111 on the [[Oricon|Oricon Charts]]. However, despite the moderate success of the album, [[Avex Trax]] released an overseas version of this album, reflecting Olivia's increasing success outside Japan. Typically, only chart-topping artists release overseas versions of their albums.

=== 2005–2006: Hiatus ===
After releasing ''[[The Lost Lolli]]'', Olivia went on an unofficial hiatus except for a performance at the "Halloween of the Living Dead" concert hosted by [[Hyde (singer)|Hyde]] on October 30, 2005. She continued to work as a fashion model.

In 2006 she provided vocals for the [[lead vocalist]] character [[Reira Serizawa]] in the [[fiction]]al band Trapnest as a part of the [[anime]] adaptation of ''[[Nana (manga)|Nana]]''.<ref name="Jame profile">[http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/database-artist.php?id=20 Jame profile] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525123503/http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/database-artist.php?id=20 |date=2007-05-25 }} Retrieved November 09 2007</ref> She produced songs under the alias ''Olivia Inspi' Reira (Trapnest)'' alongside fellow [[Avex Trax|Avex]] artist, [[Anna Tsuchiya]], who plays the role of [[Nana Osaki]], the vocalist for Trapnest's rival band Black Stones.

The [[manga]]'s author, [[Ai Yazawa]], asked for Olivia when a staff member at Avex gave her a copy of Olivia's singles "[[Sea Me]]" and "Into the Stars". It is reported that she exclaimed, "It can only be her!" when she first heard the music. "[[A Little Pain]]" was Olivia's first release for this role in which she first made the general theme to the lyrics, then wrote the song in English. Later on, the lyrics were changed to Japanese. The single is about "Reira's loneliness, pain, and strength," as Olivia found that she could relate well to the character.

Olivia later said that her musical expression had changed, that the hiatus was because she had been "feeling pretty depressed," and "started to notice and realize a lot of her faults" and that her style "has gotten a lot more detailed," it's "pleasing to the ear"and "a lot cooler". Olivia had to research Reira's character, as she "never really read manga". "A Little Pain" is specifically tailored to the point of view of Reira. She states, "It was fun to sing as another person. Like an actress. I wrote the lyrics with the image that Reira looked to herself and wrote it. But because she's Reira, she has to help all around her, and that’s why it seems as though she sings for everyone, but she sings for herself. I wrote it with that idea in my mind."<ref name="translation of Olivia interview from her official web">[http://community.livejournal.com/space_halo/43993.html translation of Olivia interview from her official web] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228064058/http://community.livejournal.com/space_halo/43993.html |date=2007-02-28 }} Retrieved November 09 2007</ref>

When "A Little Pain" was first released, it reached number eight on the [[Oricon|Oricon Charts]], her first top ten hit. After the second week, this single had outsold the total sales for her debut single, "[[I.L.Y. (Yokubō)]]" which was her highest selling single to date at the time.<ref name="Oricon Profile"/>

Olivia continued to release ''Nana''-related material throughout 2006. The next opening and ending theme songs used were both by Olivia. The single "[[Wish/Starless Night]]" was released in October and peaked at number seven. Following the success of these releases, Olivia's first US appearance was scheduled for the Asian entertainment convention [[Pacific Media Expo]] held in [[Los Angeles, California]] in October 2006.<ref name="Olivia live at PMX">[http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/article.php?id=1352 Olivia live at PMX] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029210147/http://jmusiceuropa.com/uk/article.php?id=1352 |date=2007-10-29 }} Retrieved November 09 2007</ref>

=== 2007–present: modest success ===
On January 17, 2007, ''[[The Cloudy Dreamer]]'' was released in CD and CD+DVD formats. The album debuted at number fifteen on the [[Oricon]] Weekly Charts - her highest ranking album to date. In addition to the singles previously released, the mini-album also featured the songs "Dream Catcher", which was used as the ending theme for the [[live action]] [[Japanese television drama|television drama series]] of ''[[Jigoku Shōjo]]'', "If You Only Knew", which was used as the main theme for the [[Korean drama]] ''[[The Snow Queen (South Korean TV series)|The Snow Queen]]'', as well as an English version of "Wish". Later in February, the compilation album ''[[Olivia Inspi' Reira (Trapnest)]]'' was released featuring the singles from the Nana and some new songs.

''[[Nana Best]]'', another compilation album, was released shortly thereafter. This album featured the hit songs from the [[anime]] and one unreleased song by both Olivia and [[Anna Tsuchiya]].<ref name="J!-ENT ">[http://www.nt2099.com/J-ENT/SPOTLIGHT/NANA/nanapremiumlive.pdf J!-ENT Nana Event Spotlight] Retrieved November 09 2007</ref> Olivia and Anna performed these songs together live at [[Shibuya-AX]] in March 2007.<ref name="Nana Premium live">[http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/article.php?id=2162 Nana Premium live] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701025702/http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/article.php?id=2162 |date=2009-07-01 }} Retrieved November 09 2007</ref>

[[Image:Olivia Locomotive 2007 10.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Picture of Olivia's Paris concert]]
On July 6, 2007, Olivia held a concert in [[Paris, France]] at the popular venue, [http://www.laloco.com/ La Locomotive]<ref name="Olivia Live in Paris report">[http://www.jmusiceuropa.com/uk/article.php?id=2674 Olivia Live in Paris] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029033543/http://jmusiceuropa.com/uk/article.php?id=2674 |date=2007-10-29 }} Retrieved November 09 2007</ref> singing songs from ''Olivia Inspi' Reira (Trapnest)'', ''[[The Lost Lolli]]'' and ''The Cloudy Dreamer''. She made a guest appearance at the [[Japan Expo]] on July 6 and 7.

A new song, "Bleeding Heart" was a collaborative effort with her brother, Jeffrey Lufkin. It appeared on the Vision Factory compilation album ''[[Flower Festival: Vision Factory Presents]]''.<ref name="Flower Festival Official Website">[http://www.visionfactory.jp/artist/va/disco/a_05/index.html Flower Festival Official Website] Retrieved March 27, 2008</ref> It was released on March 19, 2008.

Olivia released her sixth mini album, ''[[Trinka Trinka]]'', on September 17 with all new material.<ref name="Trinka Trinka album listing on Vision Factory">[http://www.visionfactory.jp/artist/olivia/disco/a_10/index.html Trinka Trinka album listing] Retrieved August 08 2008</ref> It featured "Rain", which was used as the second ending theme to ''[[K-tai Investigator 7]]''. The track line up confused fans as a few of the track titles were changed, such as "Real Love" which she premiered during her Paris concert, which was renamed to "Your Smile" and quite possibly "I'm So Excited" was retitled as "Trinka Trinka". Following the release of this mini album, Olivia held a live show on October 24, 2008, at [[Womb (nightclub)|Shibuya Womb]].

On December 30, 2008, Olivia participated in a duo showcase with [[Inoran]] in which she covered a few of his songs such as "Owl's Tear" and "Monsoon Baby". They talked about their collaboration single which was released on April 15, 2009. It was titled "[[Sailing Free]]" and it served as the theme song to a new game of the saga ''[[Sengoku Basara]]'', called "Sengoku Basara Battle Heroes". "Sailing Free" was her first single in three years.

''Trinka Trinka'' was re-released in France which included "Sailing Free" and it's b-sides (Love Love Love and Undress) along with a bonus track which was revealed to be World's End Girlfriend's remix of "If You Only Knew". She gave a concert for the visitors of the German [[Anime convention]] [[Connichi]] at the Kongress Palais of [[Kassel]] (former Stadthalle Kassel) from September 10–12, 2010. Olivia talked about a new release, a greatest hits album that was released on October 13, 2010. The Greatest Hits album included two brand new tracks called "Sunlight" and "Be Your Friend". These tracks saw another turn in Olivia's musical style; a combination of Trinka Trinka's pop style and The Lost Lolli's dark electronica.

Olivia's latest live appearance was at [[UppCon]] 2011, after which she took a hiatus from the music industry.

== Personal life ==
She started working at a kindergarten in Okinawa, and later moved to California. In 2012, she married Canadian Owen Vallis.<ref name="Nautiljon Profile">[http://www.nautiljon.com/people/olivia.html Nautiljon Profile]</ref> They had a son Atlas in January 2014.<ref name="Share Your Treats">[http://www.shareyourtreats.com/2013/10/14/guess-what/]</ref>
