'''Bryon Anthony McCane II''' (born September 12, 1976),<ref name="Whitburn">Whitburn, Joel (2008) ''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955–2006'', Record Research, {{ISBN|978-0-89820-172-7}}, p. 97</ref> better known by his [[stage name]] '''Bizzy Bone''', A.K.A. '''<nowiki>Lil' Ripsta</nowiki>''', is an American [[rapper]], singer and the youngest member of the [[Cleveland]] rap group [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]].

== Early life ==
Bryon Anthony McCane II was born in [[Columbus, Ohio]]. In 1980, 4-year-old Bryon and his two sisters were abducted by their mother’s boyfriend while their mother was at work and held captive for over 2 years. Bryon recalls that at first, he did not know he had been kidnapped and was made to believe that his mother and grandmother were dead.

During the time he was abducted, he lived in many homes, apartments, cars, and motels, all in northern [[Oklahoma]]. He was often beaten, tortured, and sexually assaulted. In 1983, the "family" had been living on the [[Kaw people|Kaw Indian Reservation]] in [[Kaw City, Oklahoma|Kaw, Oklahoma]] for about a year and a half. A babysitter saw his photo at the end of the made-for-TV movie ''[[Adam (1983 film)|Adam]]'' about the producer and creator of ''[[America's Most Wanted]]'', [[John Walsh (television host)|John Walsh's]] son's abduction, and called the police, resulting in his return to his family.<ref name="mtvprofile">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1453923/bone-thugs-bizzy-bone-discusses-being-kidnapped-at-age-4/ |title= Bone Thugs' Bizzy None Discusses Being Kidnapped at Age 4| work=MTV.com |date= May 13, 2002 |access-date= October 20, 2019}}</ref>

When he was thirteen Bryon began living with his oldest sister at her home near [[Cleveland, Ohio]]. During this period, he met [[Layzie Bone]], [[Krayzie Bone]], [[Wish Bone]] and [[Flesh-n-Bone]]. Bizzy Bone started in hip-hop as a founding member of the group Bone Enterpri$e, which was formed in 1992. The group was noticed by one of the founders of the rap group [[N.W.A]], Eazy-E, who modified the group's name to Thugs-n-Harmony.

In 2002, McCane appeared on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] series ''America's Most Wanted'' (hosted by John Walsh, Adam's father) <ref name= "new.music.yahoo.com">{{cite web |url= http://new.music.yahoo.com/bizzy-bone/news/bizzy-bone-to-discuss-childhood-kidnapping-on-americas-most-wanted--12065403 |title=Bizzy Bone News | publisher= Yahoo!

Bryon also wrote and performed a song, "A.M.W.", on the show in which he thanks Walsh and encourages abused children to come forward.<ref>Constantine, Tim.

== Career ==
Bizzy Bone started his solo career in 1998. He is best known for his style of combining rapid-fire raps, double harmony choruses, with a soft-spoken and high-pitched delivery. His solo debut, ''[[Heaven'z Movie]],'' was critically acclaimed and certified Gold by the [[RIAA]].

''[[The Gift (Bizzy Bone album)|The Gift]]'', released on April 7, 2001, peaked at #2 on the [[Billboard charts|US Billboard Independent Albums]] chart. Many of the songs on the album dealt with his personal life and childhood.

In 2004, Bizzy released ''[[Alpha and Omega (Bizzy Bone album)|Alpha and Omega]]'' which showed a change in his musical and lyrical content. Fans and critics responded positively to the album. Bizzy followed up with the limited-edition internet album ''[[The Beginning and the End (Bizzy Bone album)|The Beginning and the End]]''. Next, he released ''[[Speaking In Tongues (Bizzy Bone album)|Speaking In Tongues]]'' on September 27, 2005. The title references an incident in which Bizzy Bone went on a spiritual rant during an interview on Houston radio station KPFT FM, speaking in tongues. It was met with positive reviews from critics, praising its gritty, [[lo-fi]] recording quality and Bizzy's spiritually unhinged lyricism. He released four studio albums in 2006. Two of them, ''The Story'' and ''Midwest Cowboy'', performed well on the charts, garnering further positive reviews from music critics.

In 2008, Bizzy Bone reunited with Layzie Bone to re-form [[Bone Brothers]] and release two new studio albums, ''Bone Brothers III'' and ''Still Creepin' On Ah Come Up'' (released and credited solely as "Bone Thugs"). That year, Bizzy also  released two new solo albums. The first, an independent release ''Ruthless'', features  guest appearances from [[Rick Ross]] and [[Pitbull (rapper)|Pitbull]]. The other album was his major label release for After Platinum Records distributed through [[Virgin Records]], ''A Song For You'', which featured appearances from [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], Joel Madden of [[Good Charlotte]], [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]], and [[Twista]]. ''A Song For You'' was heralded by music critics as Bizzy's best album in years, if not the best of his entire solo career.{{citation needed|date= December 2019}}

In 2010, Bizzy Bone was one of the ensemble of featured artists for "We Are The World 25 for Haiti" after the country was devastated, left in ruins by a massive earthquake. The song was critically panned by music critics. 2010 would soon see the release of Bizzy Bone's first rap rock album titled ''Crossroads 2010'' on [[Sumerian Records]]. The album received positive feedback from fans and critics alike.

On September 12, 2019, Bizzy released his first album in five years, ''Carbon Monoxide''. Its title track is a direct response to the [[Migos]] for their disrespect towards Bone Thugs-N-Harmony and other artists from their era, claiming they (Migos), were the "Greatest Group of All-Time." Bizzy's fellow group member Layzie Bone publicly challenged these claims and also released a diss track towards Migos and [[21 Savage]] after the latter came to the defense of Migos, while in the process dissing Layzie Bone calling him "old, broke" and that he could have sex with Layzie's wife. Bizzy reacted apparently intoxicated live on Instagram, threatening to kill Migos and 21 Savage for their disrespect with a double barrel shotgun, which ended abruptly with the police coming to his home in response. The video soon went viral, in the event of the gun resembling [[Elmer Fudd]] the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon character. This resulted in several memes, parody videos and commentary from other artists. ''Carbon Monoxide'' debuted #3 on the [[iTunes]] album chart. He released his follow-up album "The Mantra", exactly a year later on his 44th birthday in 2020, debuting at #4 on the [[iTunes]] chart. Bizzy released his album "War of Roses" on September 12, 2021, which was on his 45th birthday, making it the third year in a row an album has been released on his birthday.

== Personal life ==
On Feb 1, 2020, Bryon married Jessica Nancy Cassidy also known as JCass. JCass is a singer, songwriter and model in Houston, Texas. They began dating in late 2016 and announced their engagement on November 26, 2017. Together they have one child, a son, by the name of Jesse Anthony McCane also known as JAM. He was born March 7, 2018 in [[Houston|Houston, Texas]]. The three share a [[YouTube]] channel called JAM tv, which showcases their family life and careers. Bizzy also has nine other children from previous relationships.
