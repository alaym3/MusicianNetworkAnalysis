'''The Kingston Trio''' is an American [[folk music|folk]] and [[pop music]] group that helped launch the [[American folk music revival|folk revival]] of the late 1950s to late 1960s. The group started as a San Francisco [[Bay Area]] nightclub act with an original lineup of [[Dave Guard]], [[Bob Shane]], and [[Nick Reynolds]]. It rose to international popularity fueled by unprecedented sales of [[LP record]]s and helped alter the direction of popular music in the U.S.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |last=Eder |first=Bruce |title=Biography of The Kingston Trio |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p2038/biography|pure_url=yes}} |website=Allmusic |access-date=July 17, 2009}}</ref>

The Kingston Trio was one of the most prominent groups of the era's pop-folk boom, which they kick-started in 1958 with the release of the Trio's [[The Kingston Trio (album)|eponymous first album]] and its hit recording of "[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]", which became a number one hit and sold over three million copies as a single.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubeck |first1=Jack |last2=Blake |first2=Ben |last3=Shaw |first3=Allan |title=The Kingston Trio On Record |publisher=KK Inc. |year=1986 |page=11 |isbn=978-0-674-95133-4}}</ref> The Trio released nineteen albums that made ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top 100, fourteen of which ranked in the top 10, and five of which hit the number 1 spot.

In 1961, the Trio was described as "the most envied, the most imitated, and the most successful singing group, folk or otherwise, in all show business" and "the undisputed kings of the folksinging rage by every yardstick".<ref>{{cite news|last=Kamm|first=Herbert|date=August 29, 1961 |title=Those Fabulous Folksingers|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1917&dat=19610829&id=kGUtAAAAIBAJ&pg=895,4516487|newspaper=The Schenectady Gazette|location=Schenectady, New York|publisher=United Feature Syndicate, Inc.|access-date=April 28, 2014 }}</ref> The Trio's massive record sales in its early days made acoustic folk music commercially viable, paving the way for singer-songwriter, [[folk rock]], and [[Americana (music)|Americana]] artists who followed in their wake.<ref name="AMG"/>

The Kingston Trio continues to tour as of 2021 with musicians who licensed the name and trademark in 2017.

==Formation, 1954–1957==
[[Dave Guard]] and [[Bob Shane]] had been friends since junior high school at the [[Punahou School]] in [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] where both had learned to play [[ukulele]] in required music classes. They had developed an interest in and admiration for native Hawaiian [[slack key]] guitarists like [[Gabby Pahinui]].<ref>''The Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 54.</ref> While in Punahou's secondary school, Shane taught first himself and then Guard the rudiments of the six-string guitar,<ref name = "Wilson">{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth|title=Dave Guard Interview| journal=Popular Folk Music Today|volume=5|issue=2|page=22| date=Spring 1991|url=http://www.kingstontrioplace.com/dgs91p21.htm|access-date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> and the two began performing at parties and in school shows doing an eclectic mix of Tahitian, Hawaiian, and [[calypso music|calypso]] songs.

After graduating from high school in 1952, Guard enrolled at [[Stanford University]] while Shane matriculated at nearby [[Menlo College]]. At Menlo, Shane became friends with [[Nick Reynolds]], a native San Diegan with an extensive knowledge of folk and [[calypso music|calypso]] songs&mdash;in part from his guitar-playing father, a career officer in the U.S. Navy.<ref name="KingstonTrio_a">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 101.</ref> Reynolds was also able to create and sing [[tenor]] harmonies, a skill derived in part from family singalongs,<ref>{{cite news |last=Lewis |first=Randy |title=Nick Reynolds obituary |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-me-reynolds3-2008oct03,0,6426162.story |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 2, 2009 |access-date=September 4, 2009}}</ref> and could play both guitar and bongo and conga drums. Shane and Reynolds performed at fraternity parties and [[luau]]s for a time, and eventually Shane introduced Reynolds to Guard. The three began performing at campus and neighborhood hangouts, sometimes as a trio but with an aggregation of friends that could swell its ranks to as many as six or seven, according to Reynolds.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 97.</ref> They usually billed themselves under the name of "Dave Guard and the Calypsonians". None of the three at that time had any serious aspirations to enter professional show business, however,<ref name="KingstonTrio_b">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 54.</ref> and Shane returned to Hawaii following his graduation in late 1956 to work in the family sporting goods business.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 55.</ref>

Still in the [[Bay Area]], Guard and Reynolds had organized themselves somewhat more formally into an entity named "The Kingston Quartet" with friends bassist [[Joe Gannon]] and vocalist Barbara Bogue, though as before the members were often joined in their performances by other friends. At one engagement at [[Redwood City]]'s Cracked Pot beer garden, they met a young San Francisco publicist named [[Frank Werber]], who had heard of them from a local entertainment reporter. Werber liked the group's raw energy but did not consider them refined enough to want to represent them as an agent or manager at that point, though he left his telephone number with Guard.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.17.">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p.17.</ref> Some weeks later (and following a brief period in which Reynolds was temporarily replaced in the quartet by Don MacArthur), Guard and Reynolds invited Werber to a performance of the group at the Italian Village Restaurant in San Francisco, where Werber was so impressed by the group's progress that he agreed to manage them provided they replace Gannon, in whose professional potential Werber had no faith.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bush | first = William | title = The Kingston Trio: Breakthrough Boys of the '60s Folk Boom | journal = Frets Magazine | volume = 6| issue = 6| page = 25 |date = June 1984}}</ref> Bogue left with Gannon, and Guard, Reynolds, and Werber invited Shane to rejoin the now more formally organized band.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.17."/> Shane, who had been performing part-time as a solo act at night in Honolulu, readily assented and returned to the mainland in early March 1957.<ref>{{cite web | last = Kergan | first = Jerry |title = Kingston Trio Timeline | work = Kingston Trio Liner Notes|url =http://www.lazyka.com/linernotes/TimeLine/TimeLinePg01.htm |access-date = March 25, 2011}}</ref>

The four drew up a contract as equal partners in Werber's office in San Francisco, deciding first on the name "Kingston Trio" because it evoked, through its association with [[Kingston, Jamaica]], the [[mento|calypso music]] popular at the time, and second on the uniform of three-quarter-length sleeved vertically striped shirts that the group hoped would help its target audience of college students to identify with them.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.19">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p.19.</ref>

==Era of peak success, 1957–61==
Werber imposed a stern training regimen on Guard, Shane, and Reynolds, rehearsing them for six to eight hours a day for several months, sending them to prominent San Francisco vocal coach Judy Davis to help them learn to preserve their voices, and working on the group's carefully prepared but apparently spontaneous banter between songs. At the same time, the group was developing a varied and eclectic repertoire of calypso, folk, and foreign language songs, suggested by all three of the musicians though usually arranged by Guard<ref name="KingstonTrio_b" /> with some harmonies created by Reynolds.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 99.</ref>

The first major break for the Kingston Trio came in late June 1957 when comedian [[Phyllis Diller]] canceled a week-long engagement at [[The Purple Onion]] club in San Francisco. When Werber persuaded the club's owner to give the untested Trio a chance, Guard sent out five hundred postcards to everyone that the three musicians knew in the Bay Area<ref name="Frets2">{{cite journal |last=Bush |first=William |title=The Kingston Trio |journal=Frets Magazine |volume=6 |issue=6 |page=26 |date=June 1984 |url=http://www.kingstontrioplace.com/fretjnp3.jpg |access-date=July 16, 2009}}</ref> and Werber plastered the city with handbills announcing the engagement.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 19.</ref> When the crowds came, the Trio had been well prepared by months of work, and they achieved such local popularity that the initial week's engagement stretched to six months.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Bush |first=William |title=The Kingston Trio |journal=Frets Magazine |volume=6 |issue=6 |page=26 |date=June 1984 }}</ref> Werber built upon this initial success, booking a national club tour in early 1958 for the Trio that included engagements at such prominent night spots as [[Mister Kelly's]] in Chicago, the [[Village Vanguard]] in New York, [[Storyville (nightclub)|Storyville]] in Boston, and finally a return to San Francisco and its showcase nightclub, the [[hungry i]], in June of that year.

At the same time, Werber was attempting to leverage the Trio's popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both [[Dot Records]] and [[Liberty Records]] expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33⅓ rpm albums had more potential for the group's music.<ref name="KingstonTrio">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 25.</ref> Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for [[Bob Hope]] who had seen and liked the group at The Purple Onion, Werber contacted [[Capitol Records]], which dispatched prominent producer [[Voyle Gilmore]] to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio's commercial potential.<ref name="Frets2" /> On Gilmore's strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.<ref name = "Frets2" />

The group's first album, Capitol T996 ''[[The Kingston Trio (album)|The Kingston Trio]]'', was recorded over a three-day period in February 1958 and released in June that year, just as the Trio was beginning its engagement at the hungry i. Gilmore had made two important supervisory decisions as producer — first, to add the same kind of "bottom" to the Trio's sound that he had heard in live performance and consequently recruiting Purple Onion house bassist Buzz Wheeler to play on the album, and second to record the group's songs without the secondary orchestral accompaniment that was nearly universal (even for folk-styled records) at the time.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 28.</ref> The song selections on the first album reflected the repertoire that the musicians had been working on for two years—re-imagined traditional songs inspired by [[The Weavers]] like "Santy Anno" and "Bay of Mexico", calypso-flavored tunes such as "Banua" and "[[The John B. Sails|Sloop John B]]" that were reminiscent of the popular [[Harry Belafonte]] recordings of the time, and a mix of both foreign language and contemporary songwriter numbers, including [[Terry Gilkyson]]'s "Fast Freight" and "[[Scotch and Soda (song)|Scotch and Soda]]", whose authorship remains unknown as of 2020.<ref>Dave Guard's name is on the copyright, but the complex story of the song's origin is related at: [http://www.lazyka.com/linernotes/thesongs/ScotchAndSoda.htm Scotch and Soda liner notes].</ref>

The album sold moderately well—including on-site sales at the hungry i during the Kingston Trio's engagement there through the summer—but it was DJs Paul Colburn and Bill Terry at station KLUB in Salt Lake City whose enthusiasm for a single cut on the record spurred the next development in the group's history. Colburn began playing "[[Tom Dooley (song)|Tom Dooley]]" extensively on his show, prompting a rush of album sales in the Salt Lake area by fans who wanted to listen to the song, as yet unavailable as a single record.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.27">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 27.</ref> Colburn called other DJs around the country urging them to do the same, and national response to the song was so strong that a reluctant Capitol Records finally released the tune as a 45rpm single on August 8, 1958; it reached the number 1 spot on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' chart by late November, sold a million copies by Christmas, and was awarded a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] on January 21, 1959.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kergan |first=Jerry |title=Kingston Trio Timeline |work=Kingston Trio Liner Notes |url=http://www.lazyka.com/linernotes/TimeLine/TimeLinePg01.htm |access-date=July 25, 2009}}</ref> "Tom Dooley" also spurred the debut album to a number 1 position on the charts and helped the band earn a second gold record for the LP, which remained charted on ''Billboard's'' weekly reports for 195 weeks.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kovach |first=John |title=What's That Sound?: An Introduction to Rock and Its History |work=Reverb: The Digital Rock Anthologies |publisher=W.W.

The success of the album and the single earned the Kingston Trio a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording|Best Country & Western Performance]] for "Tom Dooley" at the awards' inaugural ceremony in 1959. At the time, no folk music category existed. The next year, largely as a result of ''[[The Kingston Trio (album)|The Kingston Trio]]'' and "Tom Dooley",<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 33.</ref> the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] instituted a folk category and the Trio won the first [[Grammy Award for Best Ethnic or Traditional Folk Recording]] for its second studio album ''[[At Large (album)|At Large]].''

==Change and a second phase, 1961–67==
[[File:The Kingston Trio - Sunny Side.jpg|thumb|The Kingston Trio's second troupe after Guard's departure: [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]], [[Nick Reynolds]], [[Bob Shane]] (Summer 1963)]]

By early 1961 a rift developed and deepened between Guard on one side and Shane and Reynolds on the other. Guard had been referred to in the press and on the albums' liner notes as the "acknowledged leader" of the group,<ref name="Wilson"/> a description never wholly endorsed by Shane and Reynolds, who felt themselves equal contributors to the group's repertoire and success. Guard wanted Shane and Reynolds to follow his lead and learn more of the technical aspects of music and to redirect the group's song selections,<ref name="Bush, 1984 p. 26">Bush, ''Frets Magazine'' (March 1984), p. 26</ref> in part because of the withering criticism that the group had been getting from more traditional folk performers for the Trio's smoother and more commercial versions of folk songs and for the money-making copyrights that the Kingston group had secured for its arrangements of [[public domain]] songs.<ref name="AMG" /> Shane and Reynolds felt that the formula for song selection and performance that they had painstakingly developed still served them well.<ref name="Bush, 1984 p. 26"/>

Furthermore, over $100,000 appeared to be missing from the Trio's publishing royalties, an accounting error eventually rectified,<ref name="Bush, 1984 p. 26"/> which created an additional irritant to both sides. Guard regarded it as inexcusable carelessness while to Shane and Reynolds it highlighted what they perceived as Guard's propensity to claim individual copyright for some of the group's songs,<ref name="SandS">[http://www.lazyka.com/linernotes/thesongs/ScotchAndSoda.htm Kingston Trio Liner Notes: Song Profile, "Scotch and Soda"] Retrieved July 16, 2009.</ref> including "Tom Dooley" (though Guard eventually lost a suit over copyright for that number to [[Alan Lomax]], [[Frank Warner (folklorist)|Frank Warner]], and [[Frank Proffitt]])<ref>{{cite journal|last=Irvine|first=Peter|title=Folk Music, Copyright, and the Public Domain|page=4| publisher=Portland Folklore Newsletter|year=2003|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/10340653/folk-music-copyright-and-the-public-domain-peter-irvine|access-date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> and "[[Scotch and Soda (song)|Scotch and Soda]]".<ref name="SandS"/>

Following a meeting with attorneys on May 10, 1961, intended to resolve the dispute,<ref>{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Bill|date=2013|title=Greenback Dollar: The Incredible Rise of the Kingston Trio |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=130 |isbn=978-0810881921}}</ref> Dave Guard resigned from the Kingston Trio, though pledging to fulfill group commitments through November of that year. Shane, Reynolds, and Werber bought out Guard's interest in the partnership for $300,000<ref name="ShowBiz"/> to be paid over a number of years and moved to replace him immediately. The remaining Trio partners settled quickly on [[John Stewart (folk musician)|John Stewart]], a 21-year-old member of the Cumberland Three, one of the many groups that sprang up hoping to imitate the Kingston Trio's success. Stewart was well-acquainted with Reynolds and Shane, having sold two songs to the Trio, and he was a proficient guitarist, banjoist, and singer.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.27"/> Stewart began rehearsing and recording with the group nearly immediately, commencing public appearances with the Trio in September 1961.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Bill|date=2013|title=Greenback Dollar: The Incredible Rise of the Kingston Trio |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=155 |isbn=978-0810881921}}</ref>

According to Shane, "We did nearly as well with John as we did with Dave."<ref>{{cite AV media|people=Bob Shane Interview|date=2006|title=Wherever We May Go: The Kingston Trio Story|url=http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=104|medium=DVD|publisher=Shout Factory|access-date=September 18, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323135000/http://www.shoutfactorystore.com/prod.aspx?pfid=104|archive-date=March 23, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Six of the group's next seven albums between 1961 and 1963 continued to place in ''Billboard's'' Top Ten and several of the group's most successful singles, including "[[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]" and "Greenback Dollar", charted as well.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', pp. 75, 83.</ref>

Beginning in 1964, however, the Kingston Trio's dominance in record sales and concert bookings began to wane, due partly to imitators in the pop-folk world and also to the rise of other commercial folk groups like [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] whose music had a decidedly more political bent than the Trio's. The [[British Invasion]] spearheaded by [[The Beatles]], who were signed by EMI/Capitol just as the Trio's seven-year contract was running out, depressed sales of acoustic folk albums significantly, and Capitol did not make a serious effort to re-sign the group.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Bill|date=2013|title=Greenback Dollar: The Incredible Rise of the Kingston Trio |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Scarecrow Press |page=238 |isbn=978-0810881921}}</ref> According to critic Ken Barnes, the British Invasion played a significant role in curtailing the sales of the Trio's recordings.<ref name=americasradiostars>{{cite web|url=https://radioinsight.com/ross/202078/did-the-beatles-kill-americas-radio-stars/|title=Did the Beatles kill America's radio stars?|first=Ken|last=Barnes|work=Radio Insight|date=February 9, 2021|access-date=February 20, 2021}}</ref>

Werber secured a generous signing bonus from [[Decca Records]], and the last four albums of the Kingston Trio's first decade were released by that label. Without the production facilities of Capitol, however, and the expertise of Voyle Gilmore and engineer Pete Abbott, the Decca releases lacked the aural brilliance of the Capitol albums,<ref name="KingstonTrio_a" /> and none of the four sold especially well.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Bill|date=2013|title=Greenback Dollar: The Incredible Rise of the Kingston Trio |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=Scarecrow Press |pages=238–40 |isbn=978-0810881921}}</ref>

By 1966, Reynolds had grown weary of touring and Stewart wanted to strike out on his own as a singer-songwriter, so the three musicians and Werber developed an exit strategy of playing as many dates as possible for a year with an endpoint determined to be a final two-week engagement at the hungry i in June 1967.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', pp.103–104.</ref> The group followed this strategy successfully, and on June 17, 1967, the Kingston Trio ceased to be an actively performing band.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Bush| first = William|title = The Kingston Trio, Part Two: John Stewart, The "X" Factor, and the 80's | journal = Frets Magazine | volume = 6| issue = 7| page = 42| date = July 1984}}</ref>

==Hiatus and the New Kingston Trio, 1967–1976==

Bob Shane decided to stay in entertainment, and he experimented with solo work. He recorded several singles, including a well-received but under-marketed version of the song "[[Honey (Bobby Goldsboro song)|Honey]]" that later became a million-seller for [[Bobby Goldsboro]],<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', pp. 117–118.</ref> and with different configurations with other folk-oriented performers. Though finances were not an immediate concern—the Kingston Trio partners Werber, Shane and Reynolds still owned an office building, a restaurant, other commercial real estate, and a variety of other lucrative investments<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acerecords.co.uk/content.php?page_id=1316 |title=Frank Werber, 1927–2007 |author=Palao, Alec |publisher=AceRecords.co.uk |access-date=September 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621020539/http://www.acerecords.co.uk/content.php?page_id=1316 |archive-date=June 21, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>—Shane wanted to return to a group environment and in 1969 secured permission from his partners to use the mutually owned group name for another band, with Reynolds and Werber insisting only that Shane's group be musically as accomplished as its predecessors and that Shane prefix "new" to the band's title.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p.119.</ref>

Shane agreed and organized two troupes under the name of "The New Kingston Trio". The first consisted of guitarist Pat Horine and banjoist Jim Connor in addition to Shane and lasted from 1969 to 1973, the second including guitarist Roger Gambill and banjoist Bill Zorn from 1973 until 1976. Shane tried to create a repertoire for these groups that included both the older and expected Kingston Trio standards like "Tom Dooley" and "[[M.T.A. (song)|M.T.A.]]" but that would also feature more contemporary songs as well, including country and novelty tunes. The attempt did not meet with any significant success. The only full-length album released by either group was ''[[The World Needs a Melody]]'' in 1973 (though 25 years later FolkEra Records issued ''[[The Lost Masters 1969–1972]]'', a compilation of previously unreleased tracks from the Shane-Horine-Connor years), and its sales were negligible. Though both troupes of the New Kingston Trio made a limited number of other recordings and several television appearances, neither generated very much interest from fans or the public at large.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', pp. 129, 132.</ref>

==The third phase, 1976–2017==
[[File:Reunion1.jpg|thumb|right|The 1981 Reunion Concert: Nick Reynolds, Bob Shane, Dave Guard]]

In 1976, Bill Zorn left the New Kingston Trio to work as a solo performer and record producer in London.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.132">''Kingston Trio On Record'', p.132.</ref> Shane and Gambill replaced him with George Grove, a professionally trained singer and instrumentalist from North Carolina who had been working in Nashville as a studio musician.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p.133.</ref>

The same year, Shane secured from Werber and Reynolds the unencumbered rights to use the band's original name of the Kingston Trio without the appended "new" in exchange for relinquishing his interest in the still-profitable corporation, whose holdings included copyrights and licensing rights to many of the original Trio's songs.<ref name="Kingston Trio On Record, p.132"/> Since 1976, the various troupes owned by Shane have performed and recorded simply as the Kingston Trio.

The Shane-Gambill-Grove Kingston Trio existed from 1976 through 1985, when Gambill died unexpectedly from a heart attack on March 2 at the age of 42. The nine years of this configuration was to that point the longest period of time that any three musicians had worked together as the Kingston Trio, and the group released two albums of largely original material.<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p. 136.</ref>

It was during this period as well that [[PBS]] producers JoAnne Young and Paul Surratt approached Shane and the other principals of the original group with the idea of arranging a reunion concert that would be taped and used as a fundraiser for the network. Agreement was reached, and on November 7, 1981, Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and John Stewart joined the Shane-Gambill-Grove Trio and guest performers [[Mary Travers (singer)|Mary Travers]] of [[Peter, Paul and Mary]], [[Tom Smothers]] of the [[Smothers Brothers]], and [[Lindsey Buckingham]] of [[Fleetwood Mac]] at the [[Six Flags Magic Mountain|Magic Mountain]] amusement park north of Los Angeles for a show billed as "The Kingston Trio and Friends Reunion."<ref>''Kingston Trio On Record'', p.153.</ref> The different configurations of the Trio took turns performing sets of the group's best-known songs with all the artists joining onstage for a finale.

More than twenty years had passed since Dave Guard had left the group, but residual tension surfaced between Guard and Shane in an article in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that appeared in March 1982 following the national broadcast of the taped show.<ref name = "Harris">{{cite journal | last = Harris | first = Roy |title = The Kingston Trio's Weird Reunion | journal = The Wall Street Journal |publisher = Dow Jones, Inc.| date = March 12, 1982 | url = http://www.kingstontrioplace.com/wsj.htm| access-date = July 16, 2009}}</ref> Guard implicitly disparaged Shane's current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard,<ref name = "Harris"/> who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music.

[[File:Ktweb.jpg|left|thumb|The Kingston Trio in 2003: George Grove, Bob Shane, Bobby Haworth (bassist Paul Gabrielson).]]

Following the 1985 death of Roger Gambill, Kingston Trio personnel changed several times, though Shane and Grove remained constants. Bob Haworth, a veteran folk performer who had worked as a member of [[The Brothers Four]] for many years, initially replaced Gambill from 1985 through 1988 and again from 1999 through 2005. In 1988, original member Nick Reynolds rejoined the band until his final retirement in 1999. When heart disease forced Bob Shane's retirement from touring in March 2004, he was replaced by former New Kingston Trio member Bill Zorn. A year later, following Haworth's departure, Grove and Zorn were joined by Rick Dougherty, who had performed for a time with Zorn as second-generation members of another popular folk group from the 1960s, [[The Limeliters]].<ref>{{cite web |title = Tribute to The Limelitersl |publisher = Limeliters.com | url = http://www.limeliters.net/limeliters.html | access-date = September 14, 2011}}</ref>

Both the Grove–Zorn–Haworth and Grove–Zorn–Dougherty troupes of the Kingston Trio released original CDs and DVDs, and the latter configuration toured extensively for 12 years under the direction of original member Bob Shane. [[Capitol Records]],<ref>{{cite web |title=''The Kingston Trio: The Capitol Years'' |publisher=Capitol Records/EMI |url=http://www.kingstontrio.com/content/capitol_years.htm |access-date=September 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827032012/http://www.kingstontrio.com/content/capitol_years.htm |archive-date=August 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Decca Records]],<ref>{{cite web |last=Everett |first=Todd |title=Review of ''The Kingston Trio: The Best of the Decca Years'' |url=http://www.kingstontrioplace.com/flash.htm |access-date=September 7, 2009}}</ref> [[Collector's Choice Music]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Collector's Choice Catalog |url=http://www.ccmusic.com/search?mod=UP&q=&sw=kingston%20trio |publisher=Collector's Choice Music |date=June 19, 2001 |access-date=October 9, 2017}}</ref> and Folk Era Records<ref>{{cite web |last=Shaw |first=Allan |title=''The Kingston Trio: Flashback 1963'' |publisher=FolkEra/Rediscover Music |url=http://www.folkera.com/ktrio/index.html |url-status=dead |access-date=September 7, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090131084113/http://www.folkera.com/ktrio/index.html |archive-date=January 31, 2009 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> have released and continue to release compilations of older albums as well as previously unreleased tapes of both studio and live recordings from the Kingston Trio's first ten years. 

==Trademark and roster changes, 2017 to the present==
In July 2017, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' reported that a lawsuit had been filed in Los Angeles by Josh Reynolds, who is the son of Nick Reynolds, a founding member of the band, and his cousin Gerald "Mike" Marvin. Defendants included Kingston Trio performers George Grove, William Zorn and Richard Dougherty, as well as Nikki Gary, who books concerts. The lawsuit alleged that Shane and his associates accepted $100,000 from the Reynolds group in exchange for exclusive rights to use the trademarked name of the band but then allowed Grove, Zorn and Dougherty to perform as the Kingston Trio at concerts booked by Gary.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cullens |first=Ashley |title=The Kingston Trio's Trademark Sparks Legal Battle of the Bands |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7882055/kingston-trios-trademark-legal-battle |newspaper=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=July 28, 2017 |access-date=August 6, 2017}}</ref>

On August 11, 2017, the case against Grove, Zorn, and Dougherty was dismissed with prejudice in the same Los Angeles court and consequently cannot be re-filed.<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Gerald M. Marvin et al vs George Grove et al. |opinion=Case No. BC670191 |court=Los Angeles Superior Court |date=August 11, 2017 |url=http://www.lacourt.org/casesummary/ui/casesummary.aspx?#EVT |access-date=August 24, 2017 |quote=Request and Entry of Dismissal}}</ref>

In early August 2017, sole Kingston Trio owner Bob Shane announced the licensing of his trademark to the Josh Reynolds/Mike Marvin group of investors. Shane wrote on what was then the group's official website that:

<blockquote>I am pleased to announce the Kingston Trio legacy will be carried forth by Josh Reynolds, Mike Marvin and Tim Gorelangton, who will begin performing as the Kingston Trio in October 2017. As you all know, Josh is the son of founding member, and my friend and partner Nick Reynolds, and Mike Marvin is Nick’s cousin. Rounding it out is Tim Gorelangton, one of the only people Nick ever recorded with outside the Trio. It was Nick Reynolds’ and my fondest hope that Josh and Mike would carry on the Trio and family legacy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kingstontrio.com/html/kt_news.htm |title=Kingston Trio News |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=August 10, 2017 |website=kingstontrio.com |publisher=The Kingston Trio LLC |access-date=August 10, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811010656/http://www.kingstontrio.com/html/kt_news.htm |archive-date=August 11, 2017 |df=mdy-all}}</ref></blockquote>

Consequently, in October 2017, Grove, Zorn, and Dougherty were replaced as the Trio by new licensees Reynolds and Marvin and their friend, Tim Gorelangton.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kingstontrio.com/band/|title=Its[sic] All About The Music |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=kingstontrio.com |access-date=October 3, 2017}}</ref> In 2018, Josh Reynolds left the group and was replaced by Bob Haworth, who became a member of the band for the third time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://officialkingstontrio.org/bio|title=Keep The Music Playing Tour|author=<!--Not stated-->|access-date=December 12, 2018}}</ref> At the end of 2018, Haworth left the group and was replaced by Don Marovich.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://officialkingstontrio.org/bio/ |title=Kingston Trio Biography |author=<!--Not stated-->|access-date=February 4, 2019}}</ref>

==Folk music label==
===Initial criticism===
Almost from its inception, the Kingston Trio found itself at odds with the traditional music community. Urban folk musicians of the time (to whom [[Bob Dylan]] referred in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as "the left-wing puritans that seemed to have a hold on the folk-music community")<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{cite magazine | last = Gilmore | first = Mikal | title = The ''Rolling Stone'' Interview: Bob Dylan (2001) | magazine = Rolling Stone | pages =66 | date = November 22, 2001 }}</ref> frequently associated folk music with leftist politics and were contemptuous of the Trio's deliberate political neutrality.<ref name = "Dreier" /> Peter Dreier of Occidental College observed that "Purists often derided the Kingston Trio for watering down folk songs in order to make them commercially popular and for remaining on the political sidelines during the protest movements of the 1960s."<ref name="Dreier"/> A series of scathing articles appeared over several years in ''[[Sing Out!]]'' magazine, a publication that combined articles on traditional folk music with political activism.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tachi |first=Mikiko |title=Commercialism, Counterculture, and the Folk Music Revival: A Study of ''Sing Out!''

[[Frank Proffitt]], the [[Appalachian music]]ian whose version of "Tom Dooley" the Trio rearranged, watched their performance of his song on a television show and wrote in reaction, "They clowned and hipswung. Then they came out with 'This time tomorrow, reckon where I'll be/If it hadn't a' been for Grayson/I'd a been in Tennessee.' I began to feel sorty sick. Like I'd lost a loved one.

However, Trio members never claimed to be folksingers and were never comfortable with the label. The liner notes for the group's first album featured a quotation from Dave Guard asserting that "We don't really consider ourselves folksingers in the accepted sense of the word..."<ref>Liner notes from ''[[The Kingston Trio (album)|The Kingston Trio]]'', Capitol Records T996 (June 1, 1958).</ref> Guard later told journalist Richard Hadlock in ''[[Down Beat]]'' magazine: "We are not students of folk music; the basic thing for us is honest and worthwhile songs that people can pick up and become involved in."<ref name = "Downbeat">{{cite journal| last = Hadlock| first = Richard| title = The Kingston Trio Story| journal = Down Beat Magazine|date = June 11, 1959| url = http://www.lazyka.com/linernotes/articles/DownBeat06-11-59/downbeatPg01.htm| access-date = July 17, 2009}}</ref> Nick Reynolds added in the same article: "We don't collect old songs in the sense that the academic cats do...

===21st-century perspectives===
Over the years, the Kingston Trio expanded its song selection beyond the rearranged traditional numbers, calypso songs, and Broadway show tunes that had appeared on its first several albums. In an obituary for Nick Reynolds (d. October 1, 2008), Spencer Leigh wrote in Britain's ''[[The Independent|Independent on Sunday]]'':

<blockquote>
Looking at their repertoire now, it is apparent that the Kingston Trio was far more adventurous than is generally supposed. They introduced "It Was A Very Good Year" in 1961, later a standard for Frank Sinatra, and they were one of the first to spot the potential of English language versions of Jacques Brel's songs by recording "Seasons in the Sun" in 1963. They encouraged young songwriters including Hoyt Axton ("Greenback Dollar"), Rod McKuen ("Ally Ally Oxen Free", "The World I Used to Know") and Billy Edd Wheeler ("Reverend Mr Black"). Best of all, in 1962 they introduced listeners to one of the most poignant songs ever written, the anti-war ballad "Where Have All The Flowers Gone?" by Pete Seeger, formerly with the Weavers.<ref>{{cite news | last = Leigh| first = Spencer| title = Nick Reynolds: Musician Whose Work Paved The Way For Bob Dylan| newspaper = The Independent| date = October 10, 2008| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/nick-reynolds-musician-whose-work-with-the-kingston-trio-paved-the-way-for-bob-dylan-950820.html| access-date = September 4, 2009}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Further, Peter Dreier points out that "the group deserves credit for helping to launch the folk boom that brought recognition to older folkies and radicals like [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Pete Seeger]], and for paving the way for newcomers like [[Joan Baez]], Bob Dylan and [[Phil Ochs]], who were well known for their progressive political views and topical songs. By the time these younger folk singers arrived on the scene, the political climate had changed enough to provide a wide audience for protest music."<ref name="Dreier" /> Additionally, writing in the British daily ''[[The Guardian]]'', also in an obituary for Reynolds, Ken Hunt asserted that "[the Kingston Trio] helped to turn untold numbers of people on to folk music... [T]hey put the boom in folk boom... They were the greatest of the bands to emerge after the [[McCarthyism|McCarthy]]-era blacklisting of folk musicians and breathed new air into the genre."<ref>{{cite news |last=Hunt |first=Ken |title=Nick Reynolds: Founding member and guitarist for the Kingston Trio |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/oct/06/folk.usa |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=October 6, 2008 |access-date=September 4, 2009}}</ref>

==Influence==
===On folk and pop music===
The Kingston Trio's influence on the development of American popular music has been considerable. According to music critic Bruce Eder writing for [[Allmusic]].com:

<blockquote>
In the history of popular music, there are a relative handful of performers who have redefined the content of the music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as to make that a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.<ref name="AMG" />
</blockquote>

Discussing his earliest musical influences in a 2001 ''Rolling Stone'' interview, Bob Dylan remembered:

<blockquote>
There were other folk-music records, commercial folk-music records, like those by the Kingston Trio. I never really was an elitist. Personally, I liked the Kingston Trio. I could see the picture...the Kingston Trio were probably the best commercial group going, and they seemed to know what they were doing.<ref name="rollingstone.com"/>
</blockquote>

In his autobiography ''[[Chronicles: Volume One|Chronicles]]'', Dylan added: "I liked the Kingston Trio. Even though their style was polished and collegiate, I liked most of their stuff anyway."<ref>Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', 2004, pp. 32–33.</ref>

In February 1982, ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' writer Eric Zorn praised the Kingston Trio's impact on the popular music industry, claiming that "for almost five years, they overshadowed all other pop groups in America." He also noted that they "so changed the course of popular music that their impact is largely felt to this day."<ref>{{Cite news|title = The Kingston Trio Lives!|last = Zorn|first = Eric|date = February 21, 1982|work = Chicago Tribune Magazine}}</ref>

[[Jac Holzman]], co-founder of the originally folk-based [[Elektra Records]], remarked that his formerly struggling company's new-found prosperity in the late 1950s resulted from "The Kingston Trio which has the ability to capture the interest of a large number of people who have never been conscious of folk music before. In this respect, the Kingston Trio has put us on the map."<ref name = "RainbowQuest">{{cite book| last = Cohen| first = Ronald D.| title = Rainbow Quest: The Folk Music Revival and American Society, 1940–1970| url = https://archive.org/details/rainbowquestfolk00cohe| url-access = registration| publisher = [[University of Massachusetts Press]]| date = November 2002| page = [https://archive.org/details/rainbowquestfolk00cohe/page/142 142]| isbn = 1-55849-348-4}}</ref>
Even some staunch traditionalists from both the urban and rural folk music communities had an affinity for the Kingstons' polished commercial versions of older songs. In her memoir ''And A Voice To Sing With'', singer and activist Joan Baez recalled that "Traveling across the country with my mother and sisters, we heard the commercial songs of the budding folk boom for the first time, the Kingston Trio's 'Tom Dooley' and 'Scotch and Soda.' Before I turned into a snob and learned to look down upon all commercial folk music as bastardized and unholy, I loved the Kingston Trio. When I became one of the leading practitioners of 'pure folk,' I still loved them..."<ref>{{cite book |last=Baez |first=Joan |author-link=Joan Baez |title=And A Voice To Sing With: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=1987 |page=49 |isbn=1-4391-6964-0}}</ref> [[Doc Watson|Arthel "Doc" Watson]] of North Carolina, one of the most respected and influential musicians performing traditional music, remarked, "I’ll tell you who pointed all our noses in the right direction, even the traditional performers. They got us interested in trying to put the good stuff out there—the Kingston Trio. They got me interested in it!"<ref>Cohen, ''Rainbow Quest'', p.133.</ref>

===On the music business===
The guitar manufacturer [[C.F. Martin & Company]] has attributed the dramatic rise in demand for its instruments in the early 1960s in large part to the Kingston Trio's use of the company's guitars,<ref>{{cite web |last=Nicholson |first=Dudley |title=Loudest Guitar |url=http://www.s-w-b-a.com/pickers-corner/loudest-guitar/ |url-status=dead |publisher=Southwest Bluegrass Association |date=October–November 2001 |access-date=July 17, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133840/http://www.s-w-b-a.com/pickers-corner/loudest-guitar/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> which are featured prominently and without compensation on nearly all of their album covers.<ref name="MartinGuitars" /> A Martin company press release in 2007, announcing a fourth Kingston Trio commemorative model guitar, stated that

<blockquote>
...The Kingston Trio changed everything about popular music—and the entire acoustic guitar industry along with it...
It was the rise of the Kingston Trio that really established Martin as "America's Guitar"...The Kingston Trio wasn't just a musical group. It was a phenomenon, as influential in its time as The Beatles would become in theirs.<ref>{{cite press release | title = The Kingston Trio 00-21 Commemorative Guitar | publisher = Harmony Central | date = July 28, 2007 | url = https://www.harmonycentral.com/news/uncategorized/kingston-trio-50th-anniversary-00-21-r6111/| access-date = December 7, 2019}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Satirist [[Tom Lehrer]] has acknowledged the Trio's pioneering of college concerts, observing that before the Kingstons "there was no real concert circuit...The Kingston Trio started all that,"<ref name="TIME">{{cite journal| last = Corliss| first = Richard| title = That Old Feeling: Get Along Little Folkie | journal = Time Magazine| url = http://content.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,445267,00.html| date = April 21, 2003}}</ref> and in ''Time'' magazine, critic [[Richard Corliss]] asserted, "In my youth, they changed pop music, and me with it."<ref name="TIME" />
