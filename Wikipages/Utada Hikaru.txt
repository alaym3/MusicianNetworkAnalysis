{{Nihongo|'''Utada Hikaru'''|宇多田 ヒカル||born January 19, 1983}}, who is also known as '''Hikaru Utada''' and the mononym '''Utada''',<ref name=MJP/> is a [[Japanese Americans|Japanese-American]] singer-songwriter and producer. Born in the [[United States]] to Japanese parents, record producer [[Teruzane Utada|Utada Teruzane]] and {{lang|ja-Latn|[[enka]]}} singer [[Keiko Fuji]], Utada began to write music and lyrics at an early age and often traveled to [[Tokyo]] as a result of her<!--NOTE: Do not change the pronouns in this article without consensus at Talk:Utada Hikaru. Use of "she" is the result of a Request for Comment.--> father's job. Eventually, a recording contract with [[EMI Music Japan|Toshiba-EMI]] was signed. Under the stage name '''Cubic U''', she released an English-language debut album ''[[Precious (Cubic U album)|Precious]]'' in early 1998, but it was a commercial failure. In the following year, heavily influenced by R&B and dance-pop, a Japanese-language debut ''[[First Love (Utada Hikaru album)|First Love]]'' was released and became an immediate success. Backed by the success of singles "[[Automatic (Utada Hikaru song)|Automatic]]", "[[Time Will Tell (Utada Hikaru song)|Time Will Tell]]", and "[[Movin' On Without You]]", the album sold two&nbsp;million copies in its first week in Japan, topped the [[Oricon]] charts for six non-consecutive weeks and went on to sell six&nbsp;million more throughout the rest of 1999. ''First Love'' eventually became the country's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|best-selling album]] of all time.

The following album, ''[[Distance (Utada Hikaru album)|Distance]]'', was released in early 2001 and spawned Utada's biggest hit singles—"[[Addicted to You (Utada Hikaru song)|Addicted to You]]", "[[Wait & See (Risk)]]" and "[[Can You Keep a Secret? (song)|Can You Keep a Secret?]]"—which became million-sellers. The album was commercially successful and broke several sales records after three&nbsp;million copies were sold in its first week of availability in Japan, instantly becoming the country's [[Lists of fastest-selling albums#Japan|fastest-selling album]]. In 2002, backed by chart-topping singles such as "[[Traveling (song)|Traveling]]", "[[Hikari (Utada Hikaru song)|Hikari]]" and "[[Sakura Drops]]", ''[[Deep River (Utada Hikaru album)|Deep River]]'', which incorporates elements of pop folk, was released and went on to become one of Japan's [[List of best-selling albums in Japan|top-selling records]] of all-time. Subsequent full-length releases—''[[Exodus (Utada Hikaru album)|Exodus]]'', ''[[Ultra Blue]]'' and ''[[Heart Station]]''—achieved million-selling status certified by the [[Recording Industry Association of Japan]]. After a prolonged [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]], she released the acoustic-driven albums ''[[Fantôme (album)|Fantôme]]'' and ''[[Hatsukoi (Utada Hikaru album)|Hatsukoi]]'', which reached number one on the [[Oricon]] album charts.

By the end of the 2000s, Utada was deemed "the most influential artist of the decade" in the Japanese music landscape by ''[[The Japan Times]]''. Commercial success has made her one of Japan's [[List of best-selling music artists in Japan|top-selling recording artists]] of all time with over 50&nbsp;million records sold since launching her career in the late 1990s.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-utada/japan-singer-utada-makes-3rd-bid-to-crack-u-s-market-idUSTRE52M1I320090323 |title=Japan singer Utada makes 3rd bid to crack U.S. market |first=Frederick H. |last=Katayama |date=March 23, 2009 |work=[[Reuters]] |access-date=October 30, 2021}}</ref> Twelve of her singles have reached number one on the [[Oricon Singles Chart]], while ten albums have become chart-toppers. Six of her full-length releases are among the country's highest-selling albums of all time, including ''First Love'', ''Distance'' and ''Deep River'', which are among the top ten best-selling records of Japan's music history. She is best known by international audiences for writing and producing four theme-song contributions to [[Square Enix]] and [[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney]]'s collaborative video game series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'': "[[Hikari (Utada Hikaru song)|Simple and Clean]]", "[[Passion (Utada Hikaru song)|Sanctuary]]", "[[Chikai (Utada Hikaru song)|Don't Think Twice]]", and "[[Face My Fears]]".

== Career ==

===Early life and beginnings===
Utada Hikaru was born in [[New York City]] as the only child of [[Teruzane Utada]], a Japanese record producer, and his wife Junko, an {{lang|ja-Latn|[[enka]]}} singer performing under the stage name [[Keiko Fuji]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/2004/10/14/leaving-the-girl-behind/a30303f0-ae0f-408e-921d-9b17e5c9f396/ |title=Leaving the Girl Behind |work=Washignton Post |access-date=June 5, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://japantoday.com/category/entertainment/former-singer-keiko-fuji-mother-of-hikaru-utada-falls-to-death |work=Japan Today |access-date=June 5, 2021 |title=Former singer Keiko Fuji, mother of Hikaru Utada, falls to death}}</ref> At the age of 10, Utada began to write music and lyrics.<ref>{{cite news|title=As I See it: Today's Pop Idols Sound Like the Pied Piper |work=Mainichi Daily News |date=1999}}</ref> She made recordings with Keiko, releasing songs under a band named "U3" until 1996, when she started a solo project as Cubic U.

The first Cubic U single, "I'll Be Stronger", was released as a limited pressing in Japan in 1996. The next year, Utada started another project, releasing "Close to You", a cover of [[(They Long to Be) Close to You|the Carpenters' song]]. She included it on her debut album ''[[Precious (Cubic U album)|Precious]]'' the following year. Both the album and single failed to chart on [[Oricon]] in Japan.

===1998–2003: Japanese debut, ''First Love'', ''Distance'', and ''Deep River''===
Utada moved to Tokyo in the summer of 1998 and attended [[Seisen International School]], and later the [[American School in Japan]], while continuing to record on a new contract with [[Toshiba-EMI]].

''Deep River'' sold 2.35&nbsp;million copies in its first week. Oricon reported that sales eventually surpassed 3.6&nbsp;million, making Utada the only singer or group in Japanese music history to have three consecutive albums surpass the three-million mark, by [[Recording Industry Association of Japan|RIAJ]] standards.

In 2003, Utada's promotional and personal life schedules became more active due to her marriage and an agreement with [[Island Records]] in the United States to release a "proper" full-English debut album. "[[Colors (Utada Hikaru song)|Colors]]" was her only single release for 2003.

===2004–2005: Foray into international market, and ''Exodus''===
[[File:Utada Hikaru 2004.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Utada Hikaru in 2004]]
Utada's first singles [[compilation album]] ''[[Utada Hikaru Single Collection Vol. 1]]'' was released on March 31, 2004. It became the best-selling album of 2004 in Japan, making her the only solo or group artist to reach number 1 four times on the yearly charts. It was the first compilation album to reach number 1 in six years on the yearly charts, and the first compilation album to reach number 1 in twenty-six years by a female artist.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.oricon.co.jp/music/interview/040723.html|language=ja|title=宇多田ヒカル Oricon Style Special Comment}}</ref> Despite its success, the album received little promotion and no new material; moreover, it charted longer on the Oricon Albums chart than any other Utada release to date (over two years). The album sold 2.58&nbsp;million units in Japan, making it the 34th best-selling album ever in the country.<ref name="million"/> A month later, on April 21, she released a lone Japanese single for 2004, "[[Dareka no Negai ga Kanau Koro]]", which topped the singles chart for two consecutive weeks and sold 365,000 units by the year's end. It was also the main theme song for ''[[Casshern (film)|Casshern]]'', directed by her husband at the time, [[Kazuaki Kiriya]].

In mid-2004, Utada moved back to New York, and began work on a new recording contract with [[Island Records|Island Def Jam Music Group]]. On October 5, 2004, she released a North American English-language debut album, ''[[Exodus (Utada Hikaru album)|Exodus]]'', under the newly announced stage name "Utada".<ref name=MJP>{{cite web |url= http://musicjapanplus.jp/artistdb/?action=biography&artist_id=45 |title=Utada Hikaru biography |work=MusicJapanPlus.jp |access-date=November 11, 2008}}</ref> It was released on September 9 in Japan, with a special booklet and housed in a cardboard slipcase. In an [[MTV]] interview, she expressed skepticism about this American success: "I don't think it's the music that I'm concerned about. It's obviously that I look really different and there really aren't any completely Asian people [who are popular singers in the U.S.] right now."<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/yhif/utada/ |title=Utada |access-date=September 12, 2006 |first=Alyssa |last=Rashbaum |date=October 5, 2004 |work=[[MTV|MTV.com]]}}</ref> She also remarked on the album not being one that pandered to fans, but wanting to make it anyway.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2006/06/23/music/cd-reviews/utada-hikaru-ultra-blue |title=Utada Hikaru "Ultra Blue" |work=The Japan Times |access-date=January 16, 2019 |first=Daniel |last=Robson |date=June 23, 2006}}</ref> ''Exodus'' became her fourth consecutive release to debut at number 1 and boasted 500,000 copies in its first-week sales in Japan.

"[[Exodus '04]]" was released at the end of June 2005 and featured remixes from [[the Scumfrog]], [[Richard Vission]], JJ Flores and Peter Bailey. In the UK, Mercury added another two remixes for "You Make Me Want to Be a Man" in the original album, titled "You Make Me Want to Be a Man (Bloodshy & Avant Mix)" and "You Make Me Want to Be a Man (Junior Jack Mix)".

The fourth single from ''Exodus'', "[[You Make Me Want to Be a Man]]", was released in October 2005 in the UK.
