'''Nino Agostino Arturo Maria Ferrari''' ({{IPA-it|nino aɡosˈtino arˈturo maˈria ferˈrari}}), known as '''Nino Ferrer''' (15 August 1934 – 13 August 1998), was an Italian-born French singer-songwriter and author.

==Biography and career==

Nino Ferrer was born on 15 August 1934 in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], but lived the first years of his life in [[New Caledonia]] (an [[Overseas France|overseas territory]] of [[France]] in the southwest [[Pacific Ocean]]), where his father, an engineer, was working. [[Jesuit]] religious schooling, first in Genoa and later in [[Saint-Jean de Passy]], [[Paris]], left him with a lifelong aversion to the Church.<ref name=ind/> From 1947, the young Nino studied [[ethnology]] and [[archaeology]] in the [[Sorbonne]] university in Paris, also pursuing his interests in music and painting.

After completing his studies, Ferrer started traveling the world, working on a [[Cargo ship|freighter ship]]. When he returned to France he immersed himself in music. A passion for [[jazz]] and the [[blues]] led him to worship the music of [[James Brown]], [[Otis Redding]] and [[Ray Charles]]. He started to play the double bass in [[Bill Coleman]]'s New Orleans Jazz Orchestra.<ref name=ind/> He appeared on a recording for the first time in 1959, playing [[Double bass|bass]] on two 45 singles by the Dixie Cats.<ref>[http://www.45cat.com/record/prc133 Richard Bennett and his Dixie Cats] on 45cat.com</ref> The suggestion to take up solo singing came from the [[rhythm 'n' blues]] singer [[Nancy Holloway]], whom he also accompanied.<ref name=ind/>

In 1963, Nino Ferrer recorded his own first record, the [[Single (music)|single]] "Pour oublier qu'on s'est aimé" ("To forget we were in love"). 
The B-side of that single had a song "C'est irréparable", which was translated for Italian superstar [[Mina (Italian singer)|Mina]] as "Un anno d'amore" and became a big hit in 1965. Later again, in 1991, Spanish singer [[Luz Casal]] had a hit with "Un año de amor", translated from Italian by director [[Pedro Almodóvar]] for his film ''Tacones Lejanos'' (High Heels).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rts.ch/archives/tv/information/carrefour/9722863-nino-ferrer-romantique.html|title=Nino Ferrer romantique|date=1965-11-19|website=rts.ch|language=fr|access-date=2019-05-16}}</ref>

His first solo success came in 1965 with the song "Mirza". Other hits, such as "Cornichons" and "Oh! hé! hein! bon!" followed, establishing Ferrer as something of a [[List of musical comedians|comedic singer]]. The [[Stereotyping#Role in art and culture|stereotyping]] and his eventual huge success made him feel "trapped", and unable to escape from the constant demands of huge audiences to hear the hits he himself despised.<ref name=ind>[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-nino-ferrer-1172276.html Obituary] by [[James Kirkup]], ''[[The Independent]]'', 17 August 1998</ref> He started leading a life of "wine, women and song" while giving endless provocative performances in theatres, on television and on tour.<ref name=ind/>

In Italy, he scored a major hit in 1967 with "La pelle nera"<ref name="Deregibus2010">{{cite book|editor=Enrico Deregibus|title=Dizionario completo della Canzone Italiana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QBko1XW9KOUC&pg=PA188|accessdate=16 February 2017|year=2010|publisher=Giunti Editore|language=Italian|isbn=978-88-09-75625-0|page=188|chapter=Nino Ferrer}}</ref> (the French version is "Je voudrais être un noir" ["I'd like to be a black man"]<ref>{{cite book|last=Dibango|first=Manu|title=Three Kilos of Coffee: An Autobiography|url=https://archive.org/details/threekilosofcoff00diba|url-access=registration|year=1994|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-14490-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/threekilosofcoff00diba/page/67 67]}}</ref>). This [[Soul music|soul]] song, with its quasi-revolutionary lyrics  imploring a series of Ferrer's [[black music]] idols to gift him their [[black skin]] for the benefit of music-making, achieved long-lasting iconic status in Italy.<ref name="Guaitamacchi2011">{{cite book|last=Guaitamacchi|first=Ezio |title=1000 canzoni che ci hanno cambiato la vita|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3mgAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT245|year=2011|publisher=Rizzoli|language=Italian|isbn=978-88-586-1742-7|page=245|chapter=Nino Ferrer: La pelle nera}}</ref>

"La pelle nera" was followed by a string of other semi-serious Italian songs, which included two appearances at the [[Sanremo Music Festival]] (in 1968 and 1970).<ref name="Deregibus2010"/> In 1970, he returned to France and resumed his musical career there. Ferrer rebelled against the "gaudy frivolity" of French [[show business]], filled with what he perceived as its "cynical technocrats and greedy exploiters of talent" (he had considered leaving show business altogether in 1967,{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} when he left France for Italy). In his lesser-known songs, which the public largely ignored, he mocked life's absurdities.<ref name=ind/> He agreed with [[Serge Gainsbourg]] and [[Nougaro|Claude Nougaro]] that songs are a "minor art" and "just background noise".<ref name=ind/>

In 1975 he started [[Horse breeding|breeding horses]] in [[Quercy]], France. In 1989, Ferrer  obtained French citizenship, which he explained as his "celebration of the [[wikt:bicentenary|bicentenary]] of the [[French Revolution]]." He went on to record the [[French national anthem]], accompanied by a choir.

A couple of months after his mother died, Ferrer, on 13 August 1998, two days before his 64th birthday, took his hunting gun and walked to a field of corn, recently cut, near the neighbouring village of [[Saint-Cyprien, Lot|Saint-Cyprien]]. There, he lay down in a grove nearby and shot himself in the chest.<ref name=ind/> His wife Kinou, with whom he had two sons, had already alerted the ''[[gendarmerie]]'' after finding a farewell letter in the house. Next day, there were front-page headlines in most French and Italian newspapers, such as "Adieu Nino!", "Nino Ferrer Hung Up His Telephone", "Our Nino Has Left for the South." They called him the [[Don Quixote]] and the [[Corto Maltese]] of French show business.<ref name=ind/>
