==Life and career==
[[File:Robert Glasper - Leverkusener Jazztage 2016-AL5550.jpg|thumb|Robert Glasper live at Leverkusener Jazztage (Germany) on November 9, 2016]]

===Early life===
Glasper's earliest musical influence was his mother, Kim Yvette Glasper, who sang jazz and blues professionally. She took him with her to club dates rather than leave her son with babysitters. She was the music director at the East Wind Baptist Church, where Glasper first performed in public.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pianist Robert Glasper Straddles Jazz and R&B at Winter Fest|url=http://activate.metroactive.com/2013/03/robert-glasper-san-jose-jazz-winter-fest/|website=Activate.metroactive.com|access-date=May 19, 2015}}</ref> He performed during services at three churches: [[Baptist]], [[Catholic]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist]]. Glasper has said that he first developed his sound in church, where he learned his own way to hear [[harmony]] and was inspired to mix church and gospel harmonies with jazz harmonies.

Glasper attended Elkins High School in Missouri City, Texas, and the [[High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]]. In tenth grade he performed with the jazz band at [[Texas Southern University]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=talib kweli podcast w glasper|url=http://youtube.com/watch?v=WbGymZprEMs}}</ref> He was in the second Vail Jazz Workshop in 1997,<ref>https://www.vailjazz.org/education/vail-jazz-workshop/alumni/1997-alumni/</ref> and went on to attend the [[New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music]] in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Alumni|url=http://www.newschool.edu/jazz/notable-alumni/|website=Newschool.edu|access-date=May 19, 2015}}</ref> At the New School, Glasper met neo-soul singer [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]].<ref>{{cite web|title=To stop jazz's slide into irrelevancy, Robert Glasper is adding different genres to the mix|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/music-arts/robert-glasper-giving-jazz-update-article-1.1494198|website=Daily News|location=New York|access-date=May 19, 2015}}</ref> They began performing and recording together, which led to associations with a variety of hip hop and R&B artists parallel to Glasper's emerging jazz career.

===Career===
Glasper's playing career was launched in earnest whilst still studying at [[The New School]] in New York when he started touring as a sideman with some of the established greats of the scene (bassist [[Christian McBride]], and trumpeters [[Terence Blanchard]] and [[Roy Hargrove]]). At the same time, Robert was forging a friendship with his New School-mate [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]], as well as a musical bond that saw them embedded in a burgeoning hip hop and [[neo soul]] movement alongside era-defining artists such as [[Jill Scott]], [[The Roots]] and [[J Dilla]] - during which time Glasper became music director for [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def)]].

Glasper released his first album, Mood, in 2002 with [[Fresh Sound|Fresh Sound New Talent]]. Mood features six original compositions alongside versions of the [[jazz standard]]s including [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]", to which Glasper added a Radiohead-inspired spin.{{clarify|date=August 2021}} Primarily a piano trio recording, with Bob Hurst on bass and [[Damion Reid]] on drums the album also features vocalist Bilal, and saxophonists [[Marcus Strickland]] and John Ellis.

Around this time, Glasper recorded with Bilal at [[Electric Lady Studios]] for the singer's unreleased but widely leaked second album, ''[[Love for Sale (Bilal album)|Love for Sale]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gonzales|first=Michael|date=February 6, 2013|url=https://issuu.com/reviewpublishing/docs/020613_pw_opt|title=Bilal's Back, Better Than Before|newspaper=[[Philadelphia Weekly]]|access-date=July 21, 2020|via=[[Issuu]]}}</ref>

In 2005 Glasper released his debut on [[Blue Note Records]], ''[[Canvas (Robert Glasper album)|Canvas]]'', with what was to become his quintessential piano trio lineup of [[Vicente Archer]] on bass and [[Damion Reid]] on drums. The album features nine original compositions alongside a cover of Herbie Hancock's "Riot".

His third album, ''[[In My Element]]'', was released in 2007 and includes songs written in honor of Glasper's mother ("Tribute") and hip hop producer [[J Dilla]] ("J Dillalude"). The pianist also revisits Hancock's "[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]" in what was becoming his signature fusion style; moving between contemporary and classic as it segues into a version of Radiohead's "[[Everything in Its Right Place]]", and quoting [[Duke Ellington]]'s "Fleurette Africaine".

Glasper's 2009 album ''[[Double-Booked]]'' is divided between songs performed by Glasper in an acoustic piano trio format, and his groundbreaking electric group, The Experiment, with [[Derrick Hodge]], [[Casey Benjamin]] and Chris "Daddy" Dave. The album features guest vocals and spoken-word appearances by Bilal and [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def)]]. The track "All Matter", which featured Bilal, received a 2010 [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] Award nomination for Best Urban/Alternative Performance.

In February 2012, Glasper released his 5th and seminal album ''[[Black Radio]]'', which featured performances by a line up of neo soul and hip hop artists including [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]], [[Lalah Hathaway]], [[Erykah Badu]] and [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey]]. ''Black Radio'' was met with both commercial success (a #10 debut on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Top Current Albums chart) and critical acclaim, with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' declaring that it "feels like a blueprint forward"; and went on to win the 2013 [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Grammy for best R&B album]]. In November 2012 ''Black Radio Recovered: The Remix EP'' was released with five remixed tracks from the prior album, including remixes by [[Questlove]], [[Solange Knowles|Solange]], [[Georgia Anne Muldrow|Georgia Muldrow]], [[Pete Rock]] and [[9th Wonder]].

In October 2013, Glasper released ''[[Black Radio 2]]''. The core remained the Robert Glasper Experiment, featuring Robert Glasper on keyboards, [[Derrick Hodge]] on bass, [[Mark Colenburg]] on drums, and [[Casey Benjamin]] on vocoder and saxophone. Guest vocalists included [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]], [[Jill Scott]], [[Marsha Ambrosius]], [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]], [[Faith Evans]], [[Norah Jones]], [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Lupe Fiasco]] and [[Emeli Sandé]]. Notably, [[Lalah Hathaway]] and [[Malcolm-Jamal Warner]] were featured on a cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s "Jesus Children of America"; a dedication to the victims of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]]s. The track would go on to win the [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional R&B Performance|Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance]] in 2015, whilst the album was nominated for Best R&B album.

On June 16, 2015, Robert Glasper released ''[[Covered (Robert Glasper album)|Covered]]'', a return to his acoustic piano trio format alongside musicians [[Damion Reid]] and [[Vicente Archer]]. The album features cover songs, drawn from an eclectic variety of artists, including [[Radiohead]], [[John Legend]], [[Kendrick Lamar]], and [[Joni Mitchell]]. The album was recorded live at [[Capitol Studios]] in 2014. ''Covered'' was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Album]].

2015 saw Glasper and [[Lauryn Hill]] co-produce ''Nina Revisited... A Tribute to Nina Simone'', an all-star tribute album pegged to the release of [[Liz Garbus]]'s documentary ''[[What Happened, Miss Simone?]]'' The album features artists bringing a contemporary reimagining of [[Nina Simone]]'s catalogue including contributions from [[Usher (musician)|Usher]], [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and [[Mary J. Blige]].

In 2015 Glasper served as [[Film producer|producer]], [[composer]], and [[arranger]] for the film ''[[Miles Ahead (film)|Miles Ahead]]'', a [[biopic]] documenting the life of jazz trumpeter [[Miles Davis]], whom Glasper cites as being one of his major musical influences. The soundtrack primarily consists of arrangements and interpretations of some of Davis' most well-known compositions, with the exception of a few tunes written by Glasper himself, and won him the 2017 [[Grammy Award for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media|Grammy for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media]].

In 2016 Glasper was able to pay further tribute to Miles Davis, releasing ''Everything's Beautiful'' on May 27, 2016 - his first with [[Columbia Records]] and [[Legacy Recordings]]. The album serves as a tribute to Davis by way of remixes and reinterpretations of several of his original works. The album debuted in the top 10 billboard Hip Hop and R&B charts; the highest Miles Davis charted according to ''Rolling Stone''. Although Davis died in 1991, he is credited as a co-artist of the album. The album includes features from [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]], [[Illa J]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Phonte]], [[Hiatus Kaiyote]], [[Laura Mvula]], [[Georgia Anne Muldrow]], [[Ledisi]], and [[John Scofield]].

September 16, 2016, marked Glasper's return to his electric group, the Robert Glasper Experiment, with the release of ''ArtScience'': The first Experiment LP where all members write and produce, and the first with no guest vocalists - although Glasper himself sings on the album. It features saxophonist and vocalist [[Casey Benjamin]], bassist [[Derrick Hodge]] and drummer [[Mark Colenburg]] alongside Glasper, and was recorded in New Orleans. Glasper would go on to release a remix version of the album in collaboration with [[Kaytranada]] in 2018 entitled 'Robert Glasper x Kaytranada: The ArtScience Remixes',

2016 saw Glasper receive attention for his prominent role on [[Kendrick Lamar]]'s critically acclaimed album ''[[To Pimp a Butterfly]]''; notably playing on the Grammy winning track "[[These Walls (Kendrick Lamar song)|These Walls]]".

In October 2016 Glasper co-hosted the inaugural Blue Note Cruise alongside [[Gregory Porter]]. The cruise became an annual event and Robert co-hosts it each year with bassist [[Marcus Miller]].

In January 2017 Glasper performed with [[Christina Aguilera]] at Taking the Stage, the celebratory concert commemorating the opening of the Smithsonian's new National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington, D.C. It was hosted by Dave Chappelle and featured a plethora of other icons of black music and culture including Stevie Wonder, Mary J. Blige, Chuck D and others. The concert was made into a feature-length program and broadcast on ABC in June 2020.

In February 2017 Glasper partnered with Afropunk as Creative and Musical Director for their special Unapologetically Black show, performed at the [[Apollo Theater]]. A celebration of African American protest music, the show featured [[Jill Scott]], [[Bilal (American singer)|Bilal]], [[Staceyann Chin]] and [[Toshi Reagon]] alongside a special big band ensemble led by Glasper.

On September 29, 2017 Glasper released ''Our Point of View'' with the Blue Note All Stars band, for which he brought together other leading figures of his generation for a special project celebrating the legacy and future of Blue Note Records. The record featured each artists' original compositions as well as a jam session, recorded live in the studio, where the band were joined by Glasper's heroes and jazz icons [[Herbie Hancock]] and [[Wayne Shorter]]. [[Don Was]] co-produced the album with Glasper and footage of the recording session features on Sophi Huber's 2019 documentary, ''Blue Note Records: Behind the Notes''.

In September 2017, Glasper appeared on a live stream with [[Esperanza Spalding]] while recording "Heaven in Pennies" for Spalding's album ''[[Exposure (Esperanza Spalding album)|Exposure]]'', which was released in December 2017.

In 2018 Glasper formed two new supergroups: R+R=Now with [[Terrace Martin]], [[Derrick Hodge]], [[Taylor McFerrin]], [[Christian Scott]] and [[Justin Tryon]]; and [[August Greene]] with [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and [[Karriem Riggins]] accompanied by Burniss Travis and Samora Pinderhughes.

R+R=Now stands for Reflect+Respond=Now; a nod to [[Nina Simone]]'s statement that "An artist's duty, as far as I'm concerned, is to reflect the times" and a reference to the current political climate. R+R=Now's debut album, ''Collagically Speaking'', was released on June 15, 2018.

[[August Greene]] was formed by Glasper, [[Common (rapper)|Common]] and Riggins after Glasper and Riggins jointly produced Common's ''Black America'' album, which included the Emmy winning track "[[Letter to the Free]]", which featured on [[Ava DuVernay]]'s documentary ''[[13th (film)|13th]]''. The group had previously performed together for a special edition of the [[Tiny Desk Concerts]] concert series at the [[White House]] in 2016; the first and only done in the location. August Greene released their self-titled debut album on February 21, 2018.

In October 2018 Glasper launched the first of what would become his annual month-long residencies at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club]].

Each year, in the course of playing 56 sold-out shows across 30 days, Glasper curates a unique program; testimony to the breadth of his portfolio, vision and bandmates, and draws the great and the good of his creative community to the shows on and off stage. Projects have included a tribute to [[Stevie Wonder]] with [[Luke James (singer)|Luke James]], a band with [[Mos Def|Yasiin Bey (formerly Mos Def)]] and a trio with [[Esperanza Spalding]].

On October 3, 2019 Glasper released the mixtape ''Fuck Yo Feelings''; his first recording with [[Loma Vista Recordings]], on the first day of his 56-show 2019 residency at the [[Blue Note Jazz Club]]. '':Fuck Yo Feelings'' is the result of a 2-day session in which Glasper texted invitations to his musician friends to stop by the studio and organically create together. Featured artists, who included [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Cordae]], Buddy, [[Andra Day]], [[Yebba]], [[Baby Rose]] and Rhapsody, often composed their contributions on the spot. The album's name mirrors a tattoo that Glasper got a week before recording.

In 2019 Robert Glasper appeared in Toni Thai Sterrett's "Potty Break" web series as an R&B artist named "The Hawk".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackfilm.com/read/2019/01/watch-grammy-winner-robert-glasper-toni-thai-sterrett-donna-augustin-in-potty-break-webseries/|title=Watch Multi-Grammy Award Winner Robert Glasper in Toni Thai Sterrett's Potty Break Webseries|date=January 26, 2019|website=Blackfilm - Black Movies, television, and Theatre News|access-date=August 26, 2019}}</ref>

Glasper closed out 2019 by composing the original music for the documentary ''The Apollo'', which tells the story of the Harlem venue of the same name. Glasper co-wrote and performed the film's end credit song "Don't Turn Back Now" alongside [[Ledisi]].

In September 2020 Glasper collaborated with [[Common (rapper)|Common]] to write and perform the ending theme song for the educational [[Netflix]] Show ''[[Bookmarks (TV program)|Bookmarks]]'' in which Black celebrities and artists read children's books by Black authors to spark meaningful conversations about empathy, equality, justice, self-love, and anti-racism.

==Musical style==
Glasper's albums are centered around his work as a solo artist, and two bands: The Robert Glasper Trio (on piano Robert Glasper, drummer [[Damion Reid]], and bassist [[Vicente Archer]]) as an acoustic jazz trio, and The Robert Glasper Experiment (Glasper, drummer [[Mark Colenburg]], saxophonist/vocoderist [[Casey Benjamin]] and bassist Derrick Hodge) as an electronic act that defies genre norms from any single discipline. "That's what makes this band unique... We can go anywhere, literally anywhere, we want to go. We all have musical ADD and we love it."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewparish.com/event/217369-robert-glasper-experiment-oakland/|publisher=The New Parish|title=The New Parish - Robert Glasper Experiment|access-date=November 1, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103054125/http://www.thenewparish.com/event/217369-robert-glasper-experiment-oakland/|archive-date=November 3, 2013}}</ref> With primary influences in neo-soul, hip-hop, jazz, gospel, and R&B, Glasper also has reinterpreted songs from rock acts [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], [[Soundgarden]], and [[David Bowie]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Review of Robert Glasper's Black Radio|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/qjvh|publisher=BBC|access-date=November 1, 2013}}</ref> As a jazz artist, Rashod D. Ollison reviewed him after the release of ''Canvas'' as "a gifted jazz musician with a brilliant, energetic technique and a fresh, mesmerizing sense of melody and composition".<ref>{{cite news|last=Ollison|first=Rashod|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2005-09-09/news/0508230031_1_robert-glasper-blues-alley-mos-def|title=A modern-jazz master|newspaper=The Baltimore Sun|access-date=November 1, 2013}}</ref>

Glasper claims that the music of Miles Davis has had a significant influence on his style throughout his career as a musician. Both the soundtrack for ''Miles Ahead'' and the tribute album ''Everything's Beautiful'' are clear indications of this influence.

"I'm obviously influenced by Miles Davis – even just the psyche of how he thinks about music...how he moves through, and always wanted to reflect the times he's in. That's what I'm doing now. He opened that door."<ref>{{cite news|last=Chinen|first=Nate|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/26/arts/music/robert-glasper-miles-davis-everythings-beautiful.html|title=What Would Miles Davis Do?
