==History==
[[File:Phantogram in 2010.jpg|alt=The duo seated with Carter looking to the camera and Barthel looking at him incredulous|thumb|The band in 2010]]
Carter and Barthel have been friends since preschool. In mid-2007, Barthel returned home dissatisfied with pursuing a [[visual arts]] degree at [[Champlain College]] in Vermont, and Carter returned home after a brief stint in [[New York City]] with Grand Habit, an experimental band formed with his older brother, John. The two friends reunited and worked on finishing some of Carter's earlier songwriting ideas, then finally formed the band.<ref name="reverb">{{cite web|url=http://www.heyreverb.com/2010/05/07/the-reverb-interview-phantogram/|title=The Reverb Interview: Phantogram|last=Wenzel|first=John|date=May 7, 2010|publisher=The Reverb|access-date=August 29, 2011|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6Agxn1hAx?url=http://www.heyreverb.com/blog/2010/05/07/the-reverb-interview-phantogram/15564/|archive-date=September 15, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alarmpress.com/17981/features/music-interview/phantogram-dream-pop-duo-unifies-its-vision |title=Phantogram: Dream-Pop Duo Unifies Its Vision |last=Swanson |first=Charlie |date=November 5, 2010 |publisher=ALARM Press |access-date=August 29, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107223220/http://alarmpress.com/17981/features/music-interview/phantogram-dream-pop-duo-unifies-its-vision/ |archive-date=November 7, 2011 }}</ref> They played some live shows, but decided to focus the bulk of their energies on making records.

The duo was originally called Charlie Everywhere and used that name to perform around the [[Saratoga Springs, New York]] area and to release two [[extended play|EP]]s on local label Sub-Bombin Records.<ref name=reverb /> Upon signing with UK label [[Barely Breaking Even]] on January 26, 2009, they changed their name to Phantogram.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/phantogram/blog/466576539|title=We are now signed to BBE records!!!|last=Phantogram|date=January 26, 2009|publisher=MySpace|access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://shyannessongs.wordpress.com/interviews/phantogram-interview|title=Phantogram Interview|publisher=Shy Anne's Songs|access-date=August 29, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Furfaro |first=Danielle |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/localarts/charlie-everywhere-becomes-a-phantom/1609/ |title=Charlie Everywhere becomes a phantom - Arts Talk |website=Blog.timesunion.com |date=January 26, 2009 |access-date=August 22, 2016}}</ref> Carter suggested the name Phantogram when the band wanted to switch from Charlie Everywhere to "something [they] liked". Upon looking up [[phantogram]], they found that it referred to an [[optical illusion]] in which two-dimensional images appear to be [[three-dimensional]], and noted parallels between this meaning and their band and music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://skidmoresec.wordpress.com/2010/11/19/interview-phantogram|title=Interview: Phantogram|last=Dafoe|first=Taylor|author2=Drew Litowitz|date=November 19, 2010|publisher=Skidmore SEC|access-date=December 2, 2018}}</ref>

They signed with [[Barsuk Records]] in October 2009,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Phantogram/status/4830525917 |title=Hey Folks! Phantogram is now signed to Barsuk Records!!! |author=Phantogram |publisher=Twitter |access-date=October 13, 2009}}</ref> after encouragement from Erich Cannon of Portland's Spectre Entertainment, who contacted them after he heard songs on their [[MySpace]] page. "We were going to write the record, finish it, and release it as a demo for upstate," explained Barthel. "Then our plan was to move down to New York [City] to do the whole networking and meeting people kind of stuff. And we kind of skipped that whole thing, just because of the internet."<ref>{{cite web|title = Coming in from the Cold|url = http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/coming-in-from-the-cold/Content?oid=2917398|website = Portland Mercury|access-date = October 20, 2015}}</ref>

The EP featured production work from Big Boi, Phantogram, [[9th Wonder]] and [[Skrillex]]. Barthel also guest appeared on the [[Miley Cyrus]] song "Slab of Butter (Scorpion)" from her album ''[[Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz]]''.
