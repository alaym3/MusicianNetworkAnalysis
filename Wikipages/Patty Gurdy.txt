==Reception==
* ''Pirate Scum'' (Storm Seeker, 2016), [[Metal.de]] said "Patty ... does a fantastic job in songs like "The Longing". Timo's and Patty's vocals complement each other in this way. The successful folk melodies, which then pound the listener and are then contrasted again by Patty's expressive voice, provide the necessary portion of goosebumps."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metal.de/reviews/storm-seeker-pirate-scum-ep-180747/|title=Storm Seeker - Pirate Scum (EP) Review|accessdate=29 July 2020|date=13 June 2016|first=Fabian|last=Schneider|website=[[metal.de]]}}</ref> (Google translation from German)
* ''Shapes & Patterns EP'' (2018) included a cover of ''[[Over the Hills and Far Away (Gary Moore song)|Over the hills and far away]]''. The Rockoutstandout reviewer wrote "Patty Gurdy’s cover with a hurdy gurdy and vocals gives us a completely different take on the song altogether and it works very well. The echo effect on the vocals give this track that well know powerful atmosphere that the original song is able to do. I love this quirky cover and I always feel a sense of warmth when hearing the song."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rockoutstandout.com/2018/06/17/half-way-post-songs-that-have-made-my-year-so-far-pt-1/|title=Half Way Post: Songs That Have Made My Year So Far (Pt. 1)|date=17 June 2018|accessdate=21 July 2020|website=Rock Out Stand Out|first=Lotty|last=Whittingham}}</ref>
* Guest appearance on Alestorm's album ''Curse of the Crystal Coconut'' (2020). The Moshville Times reviewer said "More guest vocals feature on the epic “Zombies Ate My Pirate Ship” courtesy of Patty Gurdy (Patty Gurdy’s Circle) who also plays hurdy gurdy throughout the album. I’ll tell you this, she’s got an amazing voice! This is a song that you’d expect to sound sillier than it does, but in this case it’s the vocals that are a bit daft while the music itself is as straight-laced as could be."<ref name="Alestorm"/>
