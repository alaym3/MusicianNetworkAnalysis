== History ==

=== 2012–2014: Formation and ''Young'' ===
The National Parks began as the brainchild of frontman Brady Parks. While studying Advertising Design at Brigham Young University in Provo, Utah, Parks began writing a collection of acoustic-heavy narrative folk tunes. After forming a group called Brady Parks and the IndiAnns for a battle of the bands at Velour Live Music Gallery, this group went on to record an album called ''The'' ''Mossy Mountain'', which was released to iTunes and Spotify on February 24, 2012.

The success of this first release prompted them to launch a successful [[Kickstarter]] campaign for the album that would eventually become ''Young''.

After several lineup changes, the group rebranded and started fresh as The National Parks, with March 15, 2013 marking the band's first public performance.<ref name=":0" /> This public performance was hyped by a guerrilla marketing campaign. Hundreds of flyers were circulated around Provo, UT that offered little information other than the line, “Who are The National Parks?” A link to their website led to a video containing commentary from popular local bands and music venue owners who each explained that The National Parks were a band to be excited about.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reachprovo.com/music-news/news-the-national-parks-ready-to-rock-provo/|title=News: The National Parks Ready to Rock Provo – Reach Provo|website=reachprovo.com|language=en|access-date=2017-09-19}}</ref>

The group released ''Young'' in 2013.
