Initial coordination of musical contributions was difficult because the members all attended different schools. With two members still in high school and the others each attending different colleges, the Jakes recorded an EP, ''Shake My Hand'', with producer [[Ian Kirkpatrick (producer)|Ian Kirkpatrick]]. Band members then individually decided whether or not to put their schooling on hold to focus on music. Burger left the band to pursue an education at [[Manhattan School of Music]] in [[New York City]], and Comtois took over as the drummer. Shortly thereafter, longtime friend and collaborator Payam Doostzadeh ({{lang-fa|پیام دوستزده}}) joined as bassist.<ref name="ocregister">{{cite news

The Jakes officially changed their name to Young the Giant in January 2010 during the production of their eponymous album. Young the Giant spent 2010 opening for Minus the Bear and Steel Train while working its debut album with Joe Chiccarelli at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles. They took an old-school approach to recording the album. All the tracks were performed live which resulted in a lot of “chopping” during production. The band was very vigilant of their tracks but trusted the decisions of Joe Chiccarelli who had previously produced albums for The Shins, The Strokes, and Saints of Valory. The band believed in transparency; they only wanted to record what they could reproduce in front of an audience at a live show.<ref>{{cite web|title = Interview with Sameer Gadhia of Young the Giant {{!}} LA Music Blog|url = http://lamusicblog.com/2010/08/interview/interview-with-sameer-gadhia-of-young-the-giant/|website = lamusicblog.com|access-date = 2015-11-25}}</ref>
