==History==

===Early years (1984–1986)===
English-born guitarist [[Vernon Reid]] had formed a number of bands, and after a few years, he formed Living Colour in New York in 1984, using the [[British spelling]] of "colour".<ref>{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Joseph |title=Cult of Personality: An interview with Will Calhoun (Living Colour) |url=https://willnotfade.com/2017/04/30/will-calhoun-living-colour-interview/ |website=Will Not Fade |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616211504/https://willnotfade.com/2017/04/30/will-calhoun-living-colour-interview/ |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |date=April 30, 2017 |quote=Band founder Vernon Reid is English, so made a deliberate choice to spell 'colour' correctly with the 'U' included. But most Americans spell many words incorrectly out of ignorance. It's not much of an issue.}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Burgess |first1=Mick |title=We chat to Corey Glover from Living Colour ahead of Newcastle Riverside gig |url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/corey-glover-living-colour-interview-13670041 |work=[[ChronicleLive]] |date=September 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171109073550/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/corey-glover-living-colour-interview-13670041 |archive-date=November 9, 2017}}</ref> Reid assembled a number of bands under the name Vernon Reid's Living Colour from 1984 to 1986.<ref name="rs">{{cite web|title=Living Colour's Time Is Now|author=David Fricke|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/living-colours-time-is-now-19901101|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 1, 1990|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912232142/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/living-colours-time-is-now-19901101|archive-date=September 12, 2017}}</ref>  Reid was well known on the downtown New York jazz scenes because of his tenure in [[Ronald Shannon Jackson]]'s Decoding Society.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fricke |first1=David |title=Back in Black |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/back-in-black-2-95063/ |publisher=Rolling Stone Magazine |access-date=20 May 2021 |date=24 Sep 1987}}</ref>

Early band members included bassists Alex Mosely, [[Jerome Harris]] and Carl James, drummers Greg Carter, [[Pheeroan akLaff]] and J.T. Lewis, keyboardist [[Geri Allen]], and vocalists D.K. Dyson and [[Mark Ledford]], with Reid occasionally singing lead vocals himself. The band's sound was vastly different from the songs that showed up later on their major label recordings. Material from this period included instrumental jazz/funk workouts, politically pointed [[punk rock]] burners, experimental excursions via Reid's guitar synth, and an early version of the song "[[Funny Vibe]]", which was reworked for their debut album ''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]''.

===Mainstream success (1986–1991)===
[[File:Living-colour-live1993.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Living Colour in 1993]]
In 1986 a stable lineup was formed, consisting of vocalist/actor [[Corey Glover]], guitarist [[Vernon Reid]], bassist [[Muzz Skillings]], and drummer [[Will Calhoun]] (who had graduated with honors from [[Berklee College of Music]]),<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and the band hired managers Jim Grant and Roger Cramer. In late 1986, the band hired prodigy [[lighting designer]] Andy Elias to strengthen their live shows with explosive visual productions.<ref>Living Colour Rocks The Ritz. ''East Village Eye''. December 1986. p 6.</ref> Soon after, the band became experienced at touring, including performing regular gigs at the club [[CBGB]]. ''[[Vivid (Living Colour album)|Vivid]]'', released on May 3, 1988, gathered sales momentum only when later that year, [[MTV]] began playing the [[music video|video]] for "[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]". The album reached #6 on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. On April 1, 1989, the band performed on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Four months later, the band gained further exposure as an opening act, along with [[Guns N' Roses]], for [[The Rolling Stones]]' [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]].

In 1990 the band's second full-length album, ''[[Time's Up (Living Colour album)|Time's Up]]'', featured songs in numerous musical contexts; [[jazz fusion]], punk rock, [[Delta blues]], hip hop (cameos by [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]]), funk, thrash metal, [[Jive (genre)|jive]], and hints of [[electronica]] were all represented.<ref>{{cite web |title= Living Colour Time's Up |author= Greg Prato |url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/times-up-mw0000315449 |work= [[AllMusic]] |access-date= August 21, 2015 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150806185836/http://www.allmusic.com/album/times-up-mw0000315449 |archive-date= August 6, 2015 }}</ref> The album reached #13 on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> and won a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Hard Rock Performance. Other guests included [[Maceo Parker]] and [[Little Richard]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1991, Living Colour joined the inaugural [[Lollapalooza]] tour, and released an EP of outtakes entitled ''[[Biscuits (EP)|Biscuits]]''.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

===Second line-up and breakup (1992–1995)===
In 1992, Skillings left the band and was replaced by [[Doug Wimbish]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> This new line up released their third full-length album, ''[[Stain (album)|Stain]]'', in March 1993. The album reached #26 in the U.S., a further drop since their debut.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Despite retaining their strong fan base, Living Colour disbanded in January 1995, after failing to settle on common musical goals during sessions for their fourth studio album.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Four of these tracks were included on the compilation ''[[Pride (Living Colour album)|Pride]]''. Following the breakup, individual band members released a variety of solo efforts.

===Reunion and subsequent events (2000–present)===
Living Colour re-formed on December 21, 2000, at [[CBGB]] as a gig billed "Head>>Fake w/ special guests". Head>>Fake was the current [[drum and bass]] project headed by Calhoun and Wimbish. Glover was on the bill to sing a few songs and Reid came on after three songs. The reunion was followed by the release of the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Collideøscope]]'', in 2003, their first album not to chart in the United States, although it was critically praised.<ref>{{cite web |title=Review: Living Colour Collideoscope|author= Davey Boy |url= https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/29750/Living-Colour-Collideoscope/|work= [[Sputnikmusic]] |date=March 4, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Living Colour Collideoscope|author=Dave Mount|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-colour/collideoscope/13482/|work=Prefixmag|date=March 6, 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924124749/http://www.prefixmag.com/reviews/living-colour/collideoscope/13482/|archive-date=September 24, 2015}}</ref> In 2005, Sony Records released ''[[Live from CBGB's]]'', a live album recorded on December 19, 1989, as well as another [[compilation album|best-of compilation]], ''[[Everything Is Possible: The Very Best of Living Colour]]'', with songs from ''Vivid'' to ''Collideøscope''.
On September 22, 2006, Skillings joined the band for the first time in fourteen years when they played at a private party which drummer [[Jack DeJohnette]] threw for his wife Lydia. Wimbish was unable to come back from his base in London to play for the event, so Skillings agreed to take over for the special private event.

The band performed a week-long European Tour starting on December 12, 2006. In May 2007, the band released their first live DVD - ''[[On Stage At World Cafe Live]]''. On July 11, 2008, the band performed at the 1980s hard rock-themed [[Rocklahoma]] festival at [[Pryor, Oklahoma|Pryor]], Oklahoma. Once again, Skillings performed with them in August 2008 for a Black Rock Coalition [[Band of Gypsys]] tribute in Harlem. They performed "Them Changes" and "Power of Soul".

On October 25, 2008, MVD Audio and CBGB Records released ''CBGB OMFUG MASTERS: August 19, 2005 The Bowery Collection'', a soundboard collection of songs from the Save CBGB's benefit show. On November 25, 2008, Inakustik and MVD released ''The Paris Concert'', a [[DVD]] recorded at [[New Morning (club)|New Morning]], in Paris, France, during their 2007 European Tour. The band released their fifth studio album, ''[[The Chair in the Doorway]]'', on September 15, 2009 on Megaforce Records. The album sold approximately 2,800 copies in its first week and landed at #161 on the ''Billboard'' 200. This was the band's first album to chart since ''Stain'' in 1993. The band toured the world in support of the record.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268175/living-colour-back-with-fifth-studio-album Living Colour Back With Fifth Studio Album] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423122206/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268175/living-colour-back-with-fifth-studio-album |date=April 23, 2013 }} Billboard.com.

In an interview on breakdownroom.net, Glover hoped to release another album with the band next year. "We're going to do something different [for us] and make a real record, right now, right after we've done this one," Glover said with a laugh. The band's song "Cult of Personality" received fresh exposure from 2011, as it was used as the entrance music for [[professional wrestler]] [[CM Punk]]. In 2013, Living Colour performed the song live during Punk's entrance at [[WrestleMania 29]].

On July 2, 2014 Living Colour announced on their official website that they were putting the finishing touches on their upcoming sixth album ''[[Shade (Living Colour album)|Shade]]'', which was released on September 8, 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/living-colour-to-release-shade-album-in-september-cover-artwork-unveiled/|title=LIVING COLOUR To Release 'Shade' Album In September; Cover Artwork Unveiled|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 12, 2017|access-date=May 14, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170515024742/http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/living-colour-to-release-shade-album-in-september-cover-artwork-unveiled/|archive-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref> "''Shade'' is the sound of a band coming to terms with its shadows and light, From the blue pulpit of Robert Johnson to the mean red streets of Brooklyn to the golden lure of Hollywood, ''Shade'' is the next chapter of a unique American journey," Reid stated on the official website.

Living Colour is currently working on new material for a possible EP or seventh full-length studio album.<ref name="newmaterial"/> When asked about a month after the release of ''Shade'' if fans would have to wait another four years for the follow-up album, Reid replied, "Well I don't know about all that.

"[[Cult of Personality (song)|Cult of Personality]]" was part of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' repertoire of radio songs in [[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas soundtrack|Radio X]]. It was also the first song to be confirmed for the track list of ''[[Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock]]''. The version featured in ''Guitar Hero III'' is a new master recording of the song that features an updated solo, as the original masters could not be used.

In October 2006, "[[Love Rears Its Ugly Head]]" was ranked and voted 303 out of the 2006 songs featured in the [[Triple M]] Essential 2006 Countdown.
