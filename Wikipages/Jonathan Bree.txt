'''Jonathan Owen Bree''' is a singer-songwriter and producer from New Zealand, best known for his work as a solo artist, as well as co-founding the [[indie pop]] group [[The Brunettes]], in 1998 and [[Lil' Chief Records]], in 2002. He frequently collaborates with label-mates as a musician, engineer, and record producer.

== Early life ==
Jonathan Bree was born in New Zealand on September 1st, 1979 .<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://amp.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/jonathan-bree-sleepwalking-brunettes-so-cool-20181212-p50lqz.html|title=Why 'master of misery' Jonathan Bree is smiling behind the mask|website=Amp.smh.com.au|accessdate=19 September 2020}}</ref> Mark Lyons, frontman of [[indie pop]] band [[The Nudie Suits]], was both Bree's cousin and a mentor in Bree's formative years.<ref name="about"/> When Bree was ten, Lyons introduced him to [[Modern Lovers]], with Bree becoming a long-term fan.<ref name="interview"/> At 12 years old, Bree first played live (and recorded) as the drummer in Lyons' band, The Plaster Saints.<ref name="audioculture"/>

==Music career==
The Brunettes were formed in [[Auckland]] in 1998 by Bree and Heather Mansfield. According to Bree, "My cousin had recorded her band Yoko and I thought she had a great natural voice, no silly effected delivery. I was looking for a girl to sing on some duets I had written so I tracked down her number."<ref name="interview"/> The band independently released its first recording ''[[Mars Loves Venus EP]]'' in 1998.<ref name="nowwe"/>

In 2002, Bree founded [[Lil' Chief Records]]<ref name="nowwe"/> with fellow indie pop musician Scott Mannion of [[The Tokey Tones]]. The two men had met that year in Marbecks Record Store in Auckland, where Bree was working at the time.<ref name="amplicfier"/> The Brunettes' album ''[[Holding Hands, Feeding Ducks]]'' released in 2002<ref name="feeding"/> was the debut release for the label.<ref name="amplicfier"/>  The album received a glowing review from [[Allmusic]],<ref name="feeding"/> as did the label's second release, The Brunettes' 2003 ''[[The Boyracer EP]]''. Bree produced both albums.<ref name="boyrace"/> The next two albums on the label were released simultaneously in 2003 by The Tokey Tones, and Bree guested on some of the tracks.<ref name="cat"/>

Bree went on to release several more albums on Lil' Chief with The Brunettes. Their second album ''[[Mars Loves Venus]]'' was released in June 2004<ref name="nzmusican"/> followed by 2005's EP ''[[When Ice Met Cream]]''. In 2004, [[Ryan McPhun]] started playing in band, who opened for [[The Shins]] 2005 tour of North America. They have also opened for [[Rilo Kiley]], [[The Postal Service]], [[Broken Social Scene]], [[Clap Your Hands Say Yeah]],<ref name="lumiere"/> and [[Beirut (band)|Beirut]] and played at the 2006 [[Big Day Out]] festivals in New Zealand and Australia.

The Brunettes' album ''[[Structure & Cosmetics]]'' was released in July 2007 in New Zealand and August in the US, on [[Sub Pop]]. Their UK profile was lifted after their track "BABY" was featured in a UK campaign in December 2007, and the release of their music video.<ref name="uk"/> In 2008, The Brunettes covered [[The Cure]]'s "Lovesong" for [[American Laundromat Records]] tribute compilation ''Just Like Heaven - a tribute to The Cure''.<ref name="discogsalr"/>

In 2009, The Brunettes released the ''Red Rollerskates EP'' on Lil' Chief, shortly followed by ''Paper Dolls''. In 2010, their song "Red Rollerskates" was included in soundtrack of the [[2K Sports]] video game ''[[NBA 2K11]]''. "Brunettes Against Bubblegum Youth" was featured on an extended advertisement for ''[[Hollyoaks]]'' in the UK.

His first work post-Brunettes was as a co-producer on the [[Princess Chelsea]] album, ''Lil' Golden Book''. He also supplied vocals for the song, "[[The Cigarette Duet]]" and directed the accompanying music video, which subsequently went viral - reaching nearly 40 million views in the years that followed.

Bree's first work as a solo artist came in 2013 with the release of ''The Primrose Path''. His next album, ''A Little Night Music'', followed in 2015. Yet his big breakthrough came in the lead-up to his third album, when the song "You're So Cool" became a sensation on YouTube - drawing viewers with its odd depiction of a 1960s-style band whose faces were covered in spandex masks.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.parachutemusic.com/blog-main/jonathan-bree-youre-so-cool|title=Jonathan Bree: ‘You’re So Cool’|work=Parachute Music {{!}} Shift Pop Culture.|access-date=2017-11-23|language=en-US}}</ref> It soon surpassed 1 million views and is currently at 22.7M views as of August 2021.<ref>{{Cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxRq23qVE8A|title=Jonathan Bree - You're So Cool|access-date=2021-08-03}}</ref>
