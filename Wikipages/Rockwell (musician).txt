'''Kennedy William Gordy''' (born March 15, 1964), better known by his stage name '''Rockwell''', is an American musician, singer, and songwriter known for his 1984 hit single "[[Somebody's Watching Me]]".

==Early life==
Kennedy William Gordy (also  known as Rockwell) is the son of Motown founder and CEO [[Berry Gordy]] and Margaret Norton. His father named him Kennedy William after [[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Smokey Robinson|William "Smokey" Robinson]].<ref name='Gordy-Survival'>{{cite book |last1=Gordy |first1=Berry |title=To Be Loved: The Music, The Magic, The Memories of Motown |year=1994 |publisher=Headline Book Publishing |location=New York |isbn=0-7472-1417-4 |chapter=Survival of the Fittest: 1960–1964}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/04/01/arts/it-takes-star-quality-to-share-the-jackson-limelight.html|title=(The New York Times) IT TAKES STAR QUALITY TO SHARE THE JACKSON LIMELIGHT|last=Holden|first=Stephen|access-date=2018-04-02|language=en}}</ref>

==Career==
To avoid the appearance of [[nepotism]], he secured his record deal without his father's knowledge.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5294|pure_url=yes}} Rockwell] at Allmusic</ref> Motown actually came up with the name Rockwell and the young Gordy agreed to the change because he believed he "rocked well."

In 1984, Rockwell had his biggest single, "[[Somebody's Watching Me]]", with childhood friend [[Michael Jackson]] singing the chorus lyrics and [[Jermaine Jackson]] singing back-up.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-rockwells-paranoid-classic-somebodys-watching-me-w445172|title=How Rockwell Created Paranoid Pop Classic 'Somebody's Watching Me'|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-04-02}}</ref>  "Somebody's Watching Me" became a Gold-certified million selling #2 song in the US, which also peaked at #6 in the UK. It held #1 on Billboard's R&B chart for five weeks. Follow-up singles underperformed, with "Obscene Phone Caller" being Rockwell's only other Top 40 single. It reached #35 on the Billboard Hot 100. Rockwell released two more albums before ending his musical career with Motown.

Rockwell was not the first member of the [[Gordy family]] to hit ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 as a recording artist. His uncle, [[Robert Gordy]], reached the longer reaches of the chart in 1958 with "Everyone Was There," recording under the name of Bob Kayli.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}

In early 2021 the first single from Somebody’s Watching Me was re-released on streaming services for the first time ever.

In late 2021 a brand new Deluxe version of the Somebody's Watching Me album, that includes many remixes, instrumentals, and 12” mix’s. A new remix of Somebody's Watching Me (mainly with Michael Jackson's vocals although uncredited) was released following the song's blow up on TikTok.

==Personal life==
Rockwell is the son of [[Berry Gordy]]. Rockwell's paternal half-sister is actress [[Rhonda Ross Kendrick]], the eldest child of [[Diana Ross]]. Rockwell is also closely related to the group [[LMFAO]] through his half-brother Redfoo ([[Redfoo|Stephen Kendal Gordy]], son of Berry Gordy and Nancy Leiviska) and his nephew SkyBlu ([[Sky Blu (rapper)|Skyler Austen Gordy]], son of half-brother Berry Gordy IV and his wife Valerie Robeson).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

In July 2010, Rockwell married Nicole Moore. In 2013, he filed for divorce. The couple have no children together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tmz.com/2013/06/30/rockwell-kennedy-gordy-divorce/ |title=R&B Singer Rockwell – Somebody's Watching Me ...

On November 29, 2018, Rockwell was arrested in [[Hollywood]] for allegedly beating a female associate with a chair at the Magic Castle Hotel after she approached him and demanded payment. Rockwell was released from jail on December 1, 2018, on a $30,000 bail. On January 7, 2019, the woman, who suffered multiple injuries from the attack and had undergone surgery to repair a broken arm, filed a lawsuit against Rockwell in [[Los Angeles]] for personal injury, claiming damages exceeding $25,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://theblast.com/singer-rockwell-arrested-chair-beating-berry-gordy-son/|title=Berry Gordy's Son, Rockwell, Was Arrested for Allegedly Beating Woman With a Chair During Brutal Attack|first1=Gary|last1=Trock|first2=Liz|last2=Walters|date=January 7, 2019|website=The Blast|access-date=January 7, 2019}}</ref>
