'''Zarah Leander''' ({{IPA-de|ˈt͡sa.ʁa leː.ˈʔan.dɐ|-|De-Zarah Leander.ogg}}; 15 March 1907 – 23 June 1981) was a Swedish singer and actress whose greatest success was in Germany between 1936 and 1943, when she was contracted to work for the state-owned [[UFA GmbH|Universum Film AG]]  (UFA). This caused her films and lyrics to be identified as Nazi propaganda, though she had taken no public political position, and she remained a controversial figure for the rest of her life.

==Early career==
She was born as '''Sara Stina Hedberg''' in [[Karlstad]], studying piano and violin as a child, and sang on stage for the first time at the age of six.  She initially had no intention of becoming a professional performer and led an ordinary life for several years. As a teenager she lived two years in [[Riga]], [[Latvia]] (1922–1924), where she learned [[German language|German]], took up work as a secretary, married Nils Leander (1926), and had two children (1927 and 1929). However, in 1929 she was engaged, as an amateur, in a touring [[cabaret]] by the entertainer and producer [[Ernst Rolf]] and for the first time sang "Vill ni se en stjärna" ("Do You Want to See a Star?"), which soon would become her signature tune.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

In 1930, she participated in four cabarets in the capital, Stockholm, made her first records, including a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s "[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Falling in Love Again]]", and played a part in a film. However, it was as "Hanna Glavari" in [[Franz Lehár]]'s [[operetta]] ''[[The Merry Widow]]'' that she had her definitive break-through (1931). By then she had divorced Nils Leander. In the following years, she expanded upon her career and made a living as an artist on stage and in film in [[Scandinavia]]. Her fame brought her proposals from the [[Continental Europe|European continent]] and from [[Hollywood]], where a number of Swedish actors and directors were working.

In the beginning of the 1930s she performed with the Swedish revue artist, producer, and songwriter [[Karl Gerhard]] who was a prominent anti-Nazi. He wrote a song for Zarah Leander, "I skuggan av en stövel" ("In the shadow of a boot"), in 1934 which strongly condemned the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany.

Leander opted for an international career on the European continent. As a mother of two school-age children, she ruled out a move to America, fearing the consequences of taking the children such a great distance and being unable to find employment. Despite the political situation, Austria and Germany were much closer to home, and Leander was already well-versed in German.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

A second breakthrough, by contemporary measures her international debut, was the world premiere (1936) of ''Axel an der Himmelstür'' (Axel at the Gate of Heaven) at the [[Theater an der Wien]] in [[Vienna]], directed by [[Max Hansen (tenor)|Max Hansen]]. It was a [[parody]] of Hollywood and not the least a parody of [[Marlene Dietrich]]. It was followed by the Austrian film ''Premiere'', in which she played a successful cabaret star.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==UFA star==
[[File:Zarah Leander Se 1941.jpg|thumb|Zarah Leander on the cover of Swedish weekly ''Se'' 1941]]
In 1936, she landed a contract with [[UFA GmbH|UFA]] in [[Berlin]]. She became renowned as a very tough negotiator, demanding both influence and a high salary, half of which was to be paid in [[Swedish krona|Swedish kronor]] to a bank in Stockholm. Even though Propaganda Minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] dubbed her an "Enemy of Germany" for her aforementioned behavior, as a leading [[Movie star|film star]] at UFA, she participated in ten films, most of them great successes. Leander neither socialized with leading party members nor took part in official Nazi Party functions. A likely apocryphal meeting with Goebbels supposedly resulted in this exchange: "Zarah... Isn't that a Jewish name?" "Oh, maybe", the actress said, "but what about Josef?" "Hmmm... yes, yes, a good answer", Goebbels reportedly replied.<ref>[https://akas.imdb.com/name/nm0495136/bio Zarah Leander profile], akas.imdb.com; accessed 30 April 2015.</ref> Involvement with the Nazi propaganda machine did not prevent her from recording in 1938 the [[Yiddish]] song "[[Bei Mir Bistu Shein]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imvDoeY7vEgs://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n5BqXOKDqLs|title=Zarah Leander - Bei mir bist du schön (1938)|last=Leotaurus1975|date=10 March 2008|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Many of her songs were composed by [[Michael Jary]], with whom she had an affair, and [[Bruno Balz]] with music and lyrics, respectively. In her films, Leander repeatedly played independent, beautiful, passionate and self-confident women. Leander scored the two biggest hits of her recording career—in her signature deep voice, she sang her anthems of hope and survival: „Davon geht die Welt nicht unter” ("This is not the end of the world") and "[[Ich weiss, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen]]" ("I know that someday a miracle will happen"). These two songs in particular are often included in contemporary documentaries as obvious examples of effective Nazi propaganda. Although no exact record sales numbers exist, it is likely that she was among Europe's best-selling recording artists in the years prior to 1945. She pointed out in later years that what made her a fortune was not her salary from UFA, but the royalties from the records she released.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Leander | first1 = Zarah | last2 = Gabrielsson | first2 = Jan | title = Zarah: Zarah Leanders minnen | trans-title = Zarah: Zarah Leander's Memories | language = sv | publisher = Bonniers | location = Stockholm | year = 1972 | isbn = 978-91-0-037615-4 }}{{page needed|date=May 2018}}</ref>

==Return to Sweden==
[[File:Zarah-Leander-1957.jpg|thumb|[[Arne Hülphers]] and Zarah Leander visiting [[Helsinki]] in 1957]]
Her last film in Nazi Germany premiered on 3 March 1943. Her villa in [[Grunewald]] was hit in an air raid, and the increasingly desperate Nazis pressured her to apply for German citizenship. At this point she decided to retreat to Sweden, where she had bought a mansion at {{ill|Lönö|sv}}, not far from Stockholm. She was still contractually obligated for another film to UFA, but held up the film representatives by rejecting script after script.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

Gradually she managed to land engagements on the Swedish stage. After the war she did eventually return to tour Germany and Austria, giving concerts, making new records and acting in musicals. Her comeback found an eager audience among pre-war generations who had never forgotten her. She appeared in a number of films and television shows, but she would never regain the popularity she had enjoyed before and into the first years of [[World War II]]. In 1981, after having retired from show business, she died in Stockholm of complications from a [[stroke]].{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

==Controversy==
Leander was often questioned about her years in Nazi Germany. Though she would willingly talk about her past, she strongly rejected allegations of her having had sympathy for the Nazi regime. She claimed that her position as a German film actress merely had been that of an entertainer working to please an enthusiastic audience in a difficult time.

On the other hand, in an interview recorded shortly before his death in 1996 the senior Soviet intelligence officer [[Pavel Sudoplatov]] claimed that Leander had in fact been a Soviet agent with the codename "Stina-Rose". Recruited by the Soviet Union before the outbreak of war, she was said to have refused payment for her work because she was a secret member of the [[Left Party (Sweden)|Swedish Communist Party]] and therefore conducted the work for political reasons.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wahllöf|first1=Niklas|title=Var Zarah Leander Sovjetspion?|url=http://www.dn.se/kultur-noje/var-zarah-leander-sovjetspion|access-date=16 August 2014|work=Dagens Nyheter|date=8 July 2003|location=Stockholm|language=sv}}</ref> Leander herself denied any suggestion that she had acted as a spy for any country.

==Legacy==

Leander continued to be popular in Germany for many decades after World War II. She was interviewed several times on German television before her death. In 1983, New Wave singer [[Nina Hagen]], who had idolized Leander as a child, released the single "Zarah", based on „Ich weiss, es wird einmal ein Wunder geschehen”. In 1987, two Swedish musicals were written about Zarah Leander. In 2003, a bronze statue was placed in Zarah Leander's home town Karlstad, by the Opera house of Värmland where she first began her career. After many years of discussions, the town government accepted this statue on behalf of the local Zarah Leander Society. A Zarah Leander museum is open near her mansion outside [[Norrköping]]. Every year a scholarship is given to a creative artist in her tradition. The performer {{ill|Mattias Enn|sv}} received the prize in 2010, the female impersonator {{ill|Jörgen Mulligan|sv}} in 2009, and Zarah's friend and creator of the museum [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723143957/http://www.hoegl.net/20thCentury/memories/Pettersson_d.html Brigitte Pettersson] in 2008.
