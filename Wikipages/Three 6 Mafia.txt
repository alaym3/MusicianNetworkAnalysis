==History==

=== Origins (1988–1990) ===
Three 6 Mafia's founding members became musicians at young ages. In 1988, [[DJ Paul]], at age 11, was taking piano lessons, and his older brother,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA8YeDULaUg| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211104/VA8YeDULaUg| archive-date=2021-11-04 | url-status=live|title=DJ Paul on 'Seed of 6ix' Consisting of Lord Infamous' Son and Paul's Nephew (Part 1)|date=December 16, 2018|access-date=September 14, 2019}}{{cbignore}}</ref> [[Lord Infamous]], age 15, was a singer practicing bass and electric guitar. Paul could play piano and drums, Infamous sang and played bass and guitar. With that, the two would compose songs together.

At the same time, in [[North Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|North Memphis, Tennessee]], [[Juicy J]], at age 13, was learning how to [[Disc jockey|DJ]] as well as rap. He had initially wanted to be a singer, but in the late 1980s and early 1990s he fell in love with the [[gangsta rap]] style, and he, like his future founding group members across town, wanted to make music like popular artists at the time such as [[N.W.A]] and [[Geto Boys]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ap.swishersweets.com/outlaws/djpaul/|title=DJ Paul|last=admin|website=Swisher Sweets Artist Project|language=en-US|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref>

In 1989, DJ Paul and Lord Infamous formed the duo "Da Serial Killaz".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.26728/title.dj-paul-reflects-on-lord-infamous-career-founding-three-6-mafia|title=DJ Paul Reflects On Lord Infamous' Career & Founding Three 6 Mafia|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=December 22, 2013|website=HipHopDX|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref> It was at this time they distributed their own mixtapes of popular songs at the time at school, and Lord Infamous had started rapping with his signature triple time flow. Juicy J was also creating his own mixes by this time, but was not putting his raps on tapes just yet.

=== The beginning (1991–1992) ===
By 1991, [[DJ Paul]], had already begun to make a name for himself in the local hip hop scene through DJing at local clubs, such as Club 380 Beale, where he got his first opportunity to perform. His mixtapes, which were gradually evolving to include more and more original content of "Da Serial Killaz", also helped spread word of his talents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.memphisflyer.com/CallingtheBluff/archives/2013/04/11/q-and-a-with-dj-paul-of-three-6-mafia|title=Q & A with DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia|last=Goggans|first=Louis|website=Memphis Flyer|language=en|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref> At the time, the hip hop scene in Memphis had not taken a fully fledged form yet, but early works by artists such as DJ Spanish Fly and DJ Squeeky were hinting at what was to come.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2013/11/27/the-essential-three-6-mafia/|title=The Essential... Three 6 Mafia|date=November 27, 2013|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|language=en-US|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref> Meanwhile, [[Lord Infamous]] was still rapping and evolving his lyrical style. Up in [[North Memphis, Memphis, Tennessee|North Memphis]], [[Juicy J]] was slowly building a name for himself as well, now that he was making his own songs and distributing them with his mixtapes, as well as DJing at local clubs with his mentor.

That same year, DJ Paul and Juicy J first crossed paths after Juicy sought out Paul in 1991 for help making beats. The two quickly grew fond of each-other's musical styles and the two subsequently teamed up with Lord Infamous to form the group "The Backyard Posse". DJ Paul and Lord Infamous still continued work as "Da Serial Killaz" by themselves, and in 1992 released the first legitimate original recording to come out of the eventual Three 6 Mafia camp, "Portrait of a Serial Killa". Featuring dark beats by Paul and [[horrorcore]]-styled lyrics from Lord Infamous and DJ Paul, this tape is recognized in its raw form as a pioneering work of horrorcore hip hop. Juicy J in the meantime released his debut hard copy mixtape, ''Volume 5'', that same year, as well as his seminal track in its original form, "Slob on My Knob".

=== Debut, ''Mystic Stylez'' and ''Chapter 1: The End'' (1993–1996)  ===
The first notable release from members of the group that dropped in 1993 was [[DJ Paul]] and [[Lord Infamous]]'s ''Come With Me to Hell'', which featured original forms of future Three 6 Mafia hits such as "Tear da Club Up" and "Porno Movie". Paul's "DJ Paul Volume 12" mixtape was also released at this time. That same year, while recording music for "The Backyard Posse", Lord Infamous rapped a line referring to his crew as the "Triple Six Mafia". The group later adopted the name, seeing that the name more closely matched the bleak and dark imagery of their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.26728/title.dj-paul-reflects-on-lord-infamous-career-founding-three-6-mafia|title=DJ Paul Reflects On Lord Infamous' Career & Founding Three 6 Mafia|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=December 22, 2013|website=HipHopDX|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref>

[[Juicy J]] had yet to release a notable work of his own at this point, but in 1994 that would change with ''Vol. 9: It's On'' and ''Vol. 10: Chronicles of the Juice Manne''. Similar to Paul and Infamous's works the previous year, these tapes featured what would turn out to be some of the framework of future hit songs.

Also in 1994, the group added its fourth official member, rapper [[Koopsta Knicca]] (Robert Cooper Phillips). Following the addition, the group released their first unified release with the mixtape ''[[Smoked Out, Loced Out]]'', which featured fellow budding local rappers [[Gangsta Blac]], Kingpin Skinny Pimp, [[Playa Fly|Lil Fly]], 211, K-9, Lil Glock and S.O.G. That same year, Koopsta Knicca recorded the original version of what would become his first solo album, ''Da Devil's Playground''.

1994 also marked a significant milestone for the group, when Paul and Juicy, alongside local entrepreneur Nick Scarfo, formed [[Prophet Entertainment|Prophet]], their first imprint. Through the label, the "Prophet Posse" was created, which was a looser collective that consisted of several local Memphis rappers who associated closely with Paul and Juicy J and ultimately signed onto the label, but were not members of Triple 6 Mafia. It was at this time when Juicy J's older brother, [[Project Pat]], emerged with his debut, ''Solo Tape''.

In 1995 the group filled out when it officially added rappers [[Crunchy Black]] and [[Gangsta Boo]]. It was later this year when the group shifted its name to Three 6 Mafia and released their debut album ''[[Mystic Stylez]]'' through Prophet. The LP earned them widespread recognition and attention locally and in the southern underground hip hop scene, and as a result, Prophet landed a distribution deal with [[Select-O-Hits]]. The group's first song on the radio was "Da Summa".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://uicradio.wordpress.com/2016/10/31/criminally-underrated-juicy-j-three-6-mafia/|title=Criminally Underrated: Juicy J & Three 6 Mafia|last=Ford|first=Brody|date=October 31, 2016|website=UIC Radio|language=en|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref>[[File:Three_6_Mafia_logo.jpg|left|thumb|Three 6 Mafia's logo, seen on every album since ''[[Chapter 1: The End]]''|240px]]

In 1996, the group released ''[[Chapter 1: The End]]'', their first non-[[lo-fi music]] record. At the helm of Prophet, DJ Paul and Juicy J would produce and release a handful of albums of some of the label's other acts, including Gangsta Blac's ''Can It Be?'' and Kingpin Skinny Pimp's ''King of Da Playaz Ball'' in 1996. At the end of 1996 however, DJ Paul and Juicy J had a fallout with Nick Scarfo and a lengthy legal lawsuit ensued between the two sides over Prophet. It was at this time when Paul and Juicy laid the framework for [[Hypnotize Minds]], their own independent label which would become the powerhouse for Three 6 Mafia music. In 1997, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds inked a record label deal with [[Relativity Records|Relativity]] for distribution.

=== ''Chapter 2: World Domination'' and ''When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1'' (1997–2000)  ===
In 1997, after forming [[Hypnotize Minds]], the group signed a deal with [[Sony Music|Sony]] and began working on what would become their first [[RIAA certification|RIAA certified]] album, ''[[Chapter 2: World Domination]]''. Polishing up their darker sound for a more palatable aesthetic while still retaining their authenticity, ''Chapter 2: World Domination'' went on to reach [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] Gold status, selling over 800,000 copies in America. The LP peaked at no. 40 on The Billboard Top 200. The LP included the club anthem "Tear Da Club Up". At this point in the group's evolution, [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] began expanding their brand and focused on developing Hypnotize Minds. Along with Three 6 Mafia, they brought along several artists from Prophet in their transition to Hypnotize Minds, creating the "Hypnotize Camp Posse", the successor of the "Prophet Posse". Over the next few years, the new label would put out  and the Prophet Posse's [[Body Parts (Prophet Posse album)|''Body Parts'']],  [[The Kaze]] (trio of Project Pat, M.C. Mack and Scan Man)'s ''Kamakazie: Timez Up'', [[Indo G]]'s, [[Angel Dust (Indo G album)|''Angel Dust'']], [[Gangsta Boo]]'s ''[[Enquiring Minds]]'', [[Project Pat]]'s ''[[Ghetty Green]]'', and Hypnotize Camp Posse's self titled album (''[[Three 6 Mafia Presents: Hypnotize Camp Posse]]'').

In 1999, Tear Da Club Up Thugz, a subgroup of Three 6 Mafia members in the founding trio of DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Lord Infamous, released ''[[CrazyNDaLazDayz]]'', which is recognized as one of if not the first album made entirely in the "[[crunk]]" production style. The album included Juicy J's solo, "Slob On My Knob", and went on to be certified Gold by the RIAA. ''CrazyNDaLazDayz'' peaked at no. 18 on the Billboard Top 200 music chart. Later that year group member [[Koopsta Knicca]]'s debut album, ''Da Devil's Playground: Underground Solo'', was released independently, though like all the Hypnotize Minds albums, was still produced by DJ Paul and Juicy J.

In 2000, the group soared to new heights in the crunk music genre, carried by their most 2nd successful LP, ''[[When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6, Sixty 1]]''. The album went on to achieve RIAA Platinum status, a 1st for the group, and spawned the single "[[Sippin' on Some Syrup]]", which featured [[UGK]]

2000 represented a troubling year for the group. The Prophet Posse, which to this point had still been working closely with Hypnotize Minds in an auxiliary-type relationship, disbanded, and its members who had not made the transition to Hypnotize Minds ceased making music with Three 6 Mafia and the rest of Hypnotize Minds. Moreover, group member Koopsta Knicca was forced out of Three 6 Mafia due to ongoing legal issues which culminated with his 2000 robbery incarceration, which voided his contract with Sony and forbade him from recording with the group.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.3066/title.koopsta-knicca-a-tragic-loss-for-hip-hop|title=Koopsta Knicca: A Tragic Loss for Hip Hop|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=October 14, 2015|website=HipHopDX|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref> Koopsta Knicca was notably absent from the album cover of ''When the Smoke Clears: Sixty 6 Sixty 1'' and music videos that accompanied tracks on the album due to his incarceration, despite still being a member of the group at the time of the album's release.

=== ''Choices'' and ''Da Unbreakables'' (2001–2004) ===

Despite losing [[Koopsta Knicca]] from its ranks and cutting ties officially with Prophet, Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds were still successful. In 2001, the group released the soundtrack to the [[DJ Paul]], [[Juicy J]] and [[Hypnotize Minds]]-produced film, ''Choices''. The soundtrack was released as a studio album and (''[[Choices: The Album]]''), kept the Three 6 name and [[Hypnotize Minds]] brand growing. Moreover, Juicy and Paul successfully positioned [[Project Pat]] to become the new star of Hypnotize Minds, with his 2001 LP ''[[Mista Don't Play: Everythangs Workin]]'' hitting #4 on the [[Billboard 200]] and being certified Gold by the RIAA, being thus far the only Three 6 Mafia affiliate or member to release a RIAA-certified solo album.
2001 also saw [[Gangsta Boo]] leave Three 6 Mafia following the release of ''Choices: The Album'', citing a variety of reasons including group dynamics, religion, alleged financial mismanagement and her desire to pursue a solo career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1451101/three-6-mafias-gangsta-boo-finds-god-becomes-lady-boo/|title=Three 6 Mafia's Gangsta Boo Finds God, Becomes Lady Boo|last=Archive-Soren-Baker|website=MTV News|language=en|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vladtv.com/article/166455/gangsta-boo-reveals-why-she-left-three-6-mafia|title=EXCLUSIVE: Gangsta Boo Reveals Why She Left Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds|website=www.vladtv.com|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref>

In 2002, Juicy J and DJ Paul re-released their remastered and dramatically updated "Vol. 10" and "Vol. 16" albums respectively as ''[[Chronicles of the Juice Man]]'', and ''[[Underground Volume 16: For da Summa]]''. These LPs represented their solo studio LP debuts and the last piece of some of their older sound, effectively giving way to full on Crunk.

In 2003, the latest incarnation of Three 6 Mafia, in DJ Paul, Juicy J, [[Lord Infamous]], and [[Crunchy Black]], released their album ''[[Da Unbreakables]]''. Spawning hit singles such as "Ridin' Spinners" and "Testin' My Gangsta", the album was a success, with the RIAA certifying it Gold by the RIAA. In 2004, Three 6 Mafia began to mobilize for what would become their domination over hip-hop. They were working on a sequel to their 2001 movie, with it another studio LP, and DJ Paul, Juicy J, and Hypnotize Minds's [[Frayser Boy]], were about to ink a deal with the directors of ''[[Hustle & Flow]]'' to write an original track for the film that would ultimately result in the group winning an Oscar.

=== Academy Award, ''Choices II: The Setup'' and ''Most Known Unknown'' (2005–2006) ===
During 2005, many members had left, and with that even more affiliates, but into the fold other acts such as [[Project Pat]], [[Frayser Boy]], and [[Lil Wyte]] cropped up as successes to keep the camp moving forward. This moving forward reached its zenith in 2005-06 for Three 6 Mafia, wherein they became superstars of hip-hop. Firstly, they dropped the sequel to their ''Choices'' movie, ''[[Choices II: The Setup]]'', and a studio album to go along with it that sold 400,000 copies. Secondly, they released their most commercially successful LP, ''[[Most Known Unknown]]'', which charted at #3 on the Top 200 and went on to sell 1,600,000 copies in the United States, becoming their second album to go Platinum in America and their best selling overall. The LP featured 3 successful singles: "[[Side 2 Side]]", "[[Poppin' My Collar]]", and "[[Stay Fly]]". "Stay Fly" is Three 6 Mafia's most commercially successful song, being certified Double Platinum in America. The song featured 8Ball & MJG and Young Buck. The song also peaked at no. 13 on the Billboard Hot 100 music charts. "Poppin' My Collar", the remix which featured Project Pat, was certified Platinum by the RIAA and peaked at no. 21 on the Billboard Top 100. Also in 2005, they released an additional film, the comedy, ''Clean Up Men''.

Three 6 Mafia's rise came to a head in 2006 when they became the first hip hop group to win the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] with "[[It's Hard out Here for a Pimp]]" (which they co-wrote with Frayser Boy) as one of the theme songs for ''[[Hustle & Flow]]''. They were also the first hip hop group to perform at the ceremony, which they did with ''Hustle & Flow'' actress [[Taraji P. Henson]] reprising her chorus.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.xxlmag.com/news/latest-headlines/2006/03/three-6-mafia-wins-oscar/ |title = Three 6 Mafia and Hypnotize Minds Wins Oscar |publisher = xxxlmag.com}}</ref> It was the second hip hop song to win an Oscar, after [[Eminem]]'s "[[Lose Yourself]]" in 2002 from his film ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]''. Right before presenter [[Queen Latifah]] announced that they had won, she chuckled and sang the refrain from the song. The energy from DJ Paul, Juicy J, [[Crunchy Black]], and Frayser Boy's on-stage presence and acceptance speech was infectious, causing that year's Oscar host [[Jon Stewart]] to quip "How come they're the most excited people here tonight? Why is that? They're thrilled! They're thrilled!.... ''That's'' how you accept an Oscar!"{{sfn|Oscar telecast, Jan. 2012}}

===''Last 2 Walk'' (2007–2011) ===
On June 7, 2007, Sony announced the departure of [[Crunchy Black]]. He stated his primary reason for departing was to make a solo LP that DJ Paul and Juicy J had allegedly put off for years, as much of the material that he'd wanted on his solo LP was used for ''[[Most Known Unknown]]''. Crunchy also later cited frustration over alleged financial mismanagement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://boxden.com/showthread.php?t=749693|title=Crunchy Black Interview And Why He Left 3-6 Mafia|website=boxden.com|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FQJFgN3jCLs&list=UUSYZK3JnVse6_rmU8WKuIcg |title = Why Crunchy Blac left 3 6 Mafia million dollar question {{sic|fin|aly|nolink=y}} answered for fans |publisher = Youtube.com|access-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref> Thereafter Three 6 Mafia consisted officially of [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]].

The pair was featured along with [[Timbaland]] on fellow Memphis artist, [[Justin Timberlake]]'s single, "Chop Me Up" from his 2007 album ''[[FutureSex/LoveSounds]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H305U0|title=FutureSex / LoveSounds: Justin Timberlake: Music|access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref>[[File:Three 6 Mafia.jpg|right|thumb|Juicy J (front) and DJ Paul (back) performing in late 2007]]

In 2007, DJ Paul and Juicy J landed their own [[reality television]] show, ''[[Adventures in Hollyhood]]'', on [[MTV]]. The show focused on the pair balancing fun and studio work after their Oscar win. [[Project Pat]] and [[Lil Wyte]] along with friends Big Triece & Computer co-starred. The show premiered on April 5, 2007 on MTV & aired for 1 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/adventures_in_hollyhood/series.jhtml |title=Adventures in Hollyhood (TV Series) |publisher=MTV |date=March 21, 2007 |access-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref>

Three 6 Mafia released their 9th studio album ''[[Last 2 Walk]]'' on June 24, 2008, after multiple delays. The album featured collaborations with [[Akon]], [[Good Charlotte]], [[Lyfe Jennings]], [[UGK]], and [[8Ball & MJG]] among others.

After leaving Three 6 Mafia in 2005, [[Lord Infamous]] was featured on DJ Paul's second solo album ''[[Scale-A-Ton]]'', which was released on May 5, 2009. Lord Infamous was featured on eight tracks. Juicy J's second solo album ''[[Hustle Till I Die]]'' was released on June 16, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0026RLPYK |title=Hustle Till I Die: Juicy J: Music |access-date=March 2, 2011}}</ref> The LP featured Project Pat and other rappers such as V-Slash, [[Gucci Mane]], [[Webbie]] and [[Gorilla Zoe]].

In 2011, DJ Paul and Juicy J starred in [[VH1]]'s cooking show ''[[Famous Food]]'' together with 7 other celebrities and eventually won 1st place.<ref>{{cite web|title=Danielle Staub and DJ Paul Named Winners of VH1′s Famous Food!|url=http://www.realitytea.com/2011/09/08/danielle-staub-and-dj-paul-named-winners-of-vh1s-famous-food/|publisher=Reality Tea|access-date=December 30, 2013 |date= September 8, 2011}}</ref> In an interview, published in July 2011<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.talkofthetown411.com/2011/07/three-6-mafia-vh1-famous-foods-juicy-j.html |title= Three 6 Mafia VH1 Famous Foods Juicy J |website=TalkoftheTown411.com| access-date= July 27, 2011}}</ref> DJ Paul cleared up some controversy from the show, involving [[Ashley Alexandra Dupré]], best known from the [[Eliot Spitzer prostitution scandal]].

In December 2011, Juicy J confirmed that he was the newest member of [[Wiz Khalifa]]'s [[Taylor Gang Records|Taylor Gang]] – as an A&R and co-owner.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/09/juicy-j-stay-trippy-three-6-mafia-comeback/|title=Juicy J: Trippy Nonstop|publisher=SPIN|access-date=October 9, 2015}}</ref>

=== Hiatus, Da Mafia 6ix and independent endeavors (2012–2018) ===
By the end of 2012, [[Juicy J]] had moved completely away from Three 6 Mafia work to focus on his solo career. During this time he released a number of solo mixtapes such as ''Rubba Band Business'' and ''Blue Dream & Lean''. He also had begun frequently collaborated with [[Wiz Khalifa]], appearing on a number of his mixtapes.

After a number of mixtapes, [[DJ Paul]] released his third solo studio album ''[[A Person of Interest (album)|A Person of Interest]]'' on October 22, 2012. He announced that the album was a mix of gangsta rap and crunk music, with it also incorporating influences from dubstep and electronic dance music. The album featured past collaborators [[Lil Wyte]] and [[Gucci Mane]], and also came with a bonus DVD including a self-titled short movie, music videos and behind the scenes footage.

On November 26, 2013, DJ Paul released ''Volume 16: The Original Masters'', a remaster of his 1994 mixtape ''4 Da Summer of '94'', on [[iTunes]]. After releasing a series of singles, including the chart topping "[[Bandz a Make Her Dance]]" which featured [[2 Chainz]] and [[Lil Wayne]], Juicy J released his third solo studio album ''[[Stay Trippy]]'' under Taylor Gang Records, [[Kemosabe Records]] and [[Columbia Records]] on August 27, 2013. Juicy J has since stated that he would still "love to" participate in a Three 6 Mafia album in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.25286/title.juicy-j-says-he-would-love-to-participate-in-a-three-6-mafia-album-in-the-future|title=Juicy J Says He Would "Love To" Participate In A Three 6 Mafia Album In The Future|date=August 31, 2013|work=HipHopDX|access-date=March 19, 2015}}</ref>

In 2013, it was announced that five of the six original members of Three 6 Mafia – DJ Paul, Crunchy Black, [[Koopsta Knicca]], [[Lord Infamous]] and [[Gangsta Boo]] – were reuniting to form a new group, to be known as Da Mafia 6ix, with plans to release an album which was scheduled for a March 2014 release. At the time of the formation of Da Mafia 6ix, [[DJ Paul]] clarified that the collective was "not a Three 6 Mafia reunion" and described it as "a totally new group".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.24236/title.dj-paul-confirms-a-reunion-of-three-6-mafia-members-with-new-group-name|title=DJ Paul Confirms A Reunion Of Three 6 Mafia Members, With New Group Name|last=http://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX -|work=HipHopDX|access-date=June 26, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> The new group opted for a style reflecting their roots, focusing largely on the horrorcore foundations of their early works.

Gangsta Boo would leave Da Mafia 6ix in May 2014. DJ Paul explained it saying, "It was what we thought was going to be best for everybody. It just happened. Nobody forced nobody.

=== Reunion performances and tour (2019–present) ===
In August 2019, group leaders [[DJ Paul]] and [[Juicy J]] announced they would soon be reviving Three 6 Mafia and reuniting for performances together for the first time in several years.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Juicy J Announces Three 6 Mafia Reunion Shows|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/08/juicy-j-announces-three-6-mafia-reunion-tour|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref> The slate of performances kicked off with a show on October 12, 2019 at the [[Landers Center]] in the [[Memphis metropolitan area]], where the group hails from. The performance featured many of the group's biggest hits and included the other two living members of the original group, [[Crunchy Black]] and [[Gangsta Boo]], as well as three fellow [[Hypnotize Camp Posse]] members who were so synonymous with the group that they were often incorrectly or unofficially labeled as members, [[Project Pat]], [[La Chat]] and [[Lil Wyte]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jackson|first=Phillip|title=Three 6 Mafia reminds fans of what used to be during 2019 reunion tour|url=https://www.commercialappeal.com/story/news/2019/10/13/three-six-mafia-gives-nostalgic-performance-during-reunion-tour/3948343002/|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=The Commercial Appeal|language=en-US}}</ref> The series of performances, mostly taking place in the [[Southeastern United States]], continued into 2020, and were successful to the point where DJ Paul and Juicy announced on February 12 an organized official reunion tour at locations across the United States would begin the following month.<ref>{{Cite web|last1=February 12|first1=Marisa MendezPublished|last2=2020|title=Three 6 Mafia Announce Official Reunion Tour Dates|url=https://www.xxlmag.com/three-6-mafia-reunion-tour-dates/|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=XXL Mag|language=en}}</ref> In April, the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] forced the postponement of the remainder of the tour.

The reunion performances and subsequent tour have further fueled speculation that Three 6 Mafia may come out with new music or ultimately a tenth studio album, but no timetable has been revealed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.935kday.com/2018/10/02/dj-paul-juicy-j-looking-to-reunite-for-more-three-6-mafia-music/|title=DJ Paul & Juicy J Looking To Reunite For More Three 6 Mafia Music|date=October 2, 2018|website=935kday.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=September 8, 2019|title=DJ Paul Addresses Possibility Of New Three 6 Mafia Album Amid Reunion Tour|url=https://hiphopdx.com/news/id.52736/title.dj-paul-addresses-possibility-of-new-three-6-mafia-album-amid-reunion-tour|access-date=December 1, 2020|website=HipHopDX}}</ref>

=== The Posse ===
Three 6 Mafia never officially expanded beyond the six original members of the group, but it had an expanded version, known initially as ''Prophet Posse'' and later as ''Hypnotize Camp Posse'' (in reference to the Three 6 Mafia-created and sponsored labels, [[Prophet Entertainment|Prophet]] and [[Hypnotize Minds]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/hypnotize-camp-posse-mn0000826022|title=Hypnotize Camp Posse {{!}} Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=January 13, 2019}}</ref> Artists from the posse were featured heavily on Three 6 Mafia works, contributing significantly to the group's ascension.
