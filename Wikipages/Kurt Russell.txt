=== Disney star ===
In 1966, the last thing [[Walt Disney]] wrote were the words "Kurt Russell" on a piece of paper.<ref>White, Micah (November 26, 2013). [http://www.biography.com/news/walt-disney-biography-facts-video "Walt Disney: 7 Things You Didn't Know About the Man & the Magic"], biography.com; accessed May 6, 2017.</ref>

That same year, Russell was signed to a ten-year contract with [[The Walt Disney Company]], where he became, according to [[Robert Osborne]], the "studio's top star of the '70s".<ref name="Osbourne2007" /> Russell's first film for Disney was ''[[Follow Me, Boys!]]'' (1966).

For Disney he made ''[[The Horse in the Gray Flannel Suit]]'' (1969) and ''[[Guns in the Heather]]'' (1969).

=== Stardom ===
[[File:Kurt Russell 1974.JPG|thumb|Russell in a 1974 publicity photo]]
Disney promoted Russell to star roles with ''[[The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes]]'' (1970) which was a big hit. He followed it with ''[[The Barefoot Executive]]'' (1971), another success.

In 1971, he co-starred as a young robber released from jail, alongside [[James Stewart]] in ''[[Fools' Parade]]''. Later, he guest-starred in an episode of ''[[Room 222]]'' as an idealistic high school student who assumed the costumed identity of [[Paul Revere]] to warn of the dangers of pollution.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

However, the bulk of his film work was for Disney in films such as ''[[Now You See Him, Now You Don't]]'' (1971), ''[[Charley and the Angel]]'' (1973), and ''[[Superdad]]'' (1973).

==== Baseball career ====

While in the field turning the pivot of a [[double play]] early in the season, the incoming runner at second base collided with him and tore the [[rotator cuff]] in Russell's right (throwing) shoulder. He did not return to El Paso, but was a [[designated hitter]] for the independent [[Portland Mavericks]] in the Northwest League late in their short season. The team was owned by his father, and he had been doing promotional work for them in the interim.<ref name=wkrtjmros>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=GDpYAAAAIBAJ&pg=4325%2C2505341 |newspaper=The Bulletin|location=Bend, Oregon|agency=Associated Press |title=Wise, Kurt Russell to join Mavericks for rest of season|date=July 27, 1973 |page=11}}</ref> The injury forced his retirement from baseball in 1973 and led to his return to acting.<ref name=bpkr>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9JhJAAAAIBAJ&pg=1258,367525|newspaper=Youngstown Vindicator|location=Ohio|agency=Newhouse News Service |last=Freedman|first=Richard|title=Baseball player Kurt Russell banging out hits in new field |date=August 2, 1981|page=B6}}</ref>

More popular at the box office was ''[[Overboard (1987 film)|Overboard]]'' (1987), a comedy with Goldie Hawn.

=== 1988–present ===
[[File:P1090663 Russell.jpg|thumb|left|Russell in 2006]]
Russell credited his performance in ''[[Tequila Sunrise (film)|Tequila Sunrise]]'' (1988) with getting Hollywood to regard him differently.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} He was in ''[[Winter People]]'' (1989) then co starred with [[Sylvester Stallone]] in ''[[Tango & Cash]]'' (1989).

Russell played Lt.

"In many ways", wrote Claudia Puig of ''[[USA Today]]'', "''Miracle'' belongs to Kurt Russell." [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' wrote, "Russell does real acting here."<ref>{{Cite web |date=February 6, 2004 |url=https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/miracle-2004 |title=Miracle |last=Ebert |first=Roger |website=www.rogerebert.com |access-date=May 9, 2018}}</ref> [[Elvis Mitchell]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "Mr. Russell<nowiki>'s cagey and remote performance gives ''Miracle''</nowiki> its few breezes of fresh air."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/06/movies/film-review-a-hollywood-ending-from-real-life.html|title=Film Review; A Hollywood Ending From Real Life|last=Mitchell|first=Elvis |date=February 6, 2004|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 9, 2018|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 2006, Russell claimed in one interview that he had ghost-directed the hit 1993 western film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' on behalf of credited director [[George P. Cosmatos]], saying he gave Cosmatos shot lists.<ref name="beck">{{cite magazine |last=Beck |first=Henry Cabot |date=October 2006 |magazine=True West Magazine |url=http://www.truewestmagazine.com/archives/westerns/2006/western-russell_godfather_10_06.htm |title=The 'Western' Godfather |access-date=December 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122213246/http://www.truewestmagazine.com/archives/westerns/2006/western-russell_godfather_10_06.htm |archive-date=January 22, 2007}}</ref> Russell claimed Stallone recommended Cosmatos to him after the removal of the first director, writer [[Kevin Jarre]], but Cosmatos had also worked with ''Tombstone'' executive producer [[Andrew G. Vajna]] before on ''[[Rambo: First Blood Part II]]''. Russell said he promised Cosmatos he would keep it a secret as long as Cosmatos was alive; Cosmatos died in April 2005.<ref name="beck" /> Russell said he didn't get a chance to edit his version, but Vajna gave him a tape of "everything on the movie" and that he might try to "reconstruct the movie", although he would need to go back to the script and all his notes.<ref name="beck" />

Russell played the villainous Stuntman Mike in [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s segment ''[[Death Proof]]'' of the film ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' (2007). After a remake of ''Escape from New York'' was announced, Russell was reportedly upset with [[Gerard Butler]] for playing his signature character, Snake Plissken, as he believed the character 'was quintessentially [...] American.'<ref>{{cite web|author=Stax|url= https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/22/kurt-blasts-escape-remake|title=Kurt Blasts 'Escape' Remake|work=IGN|date=March 22, 2007 |access-date=August 15, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=March 25, 2007 |url=http://www.pr-inside.com/russell-enraged-with-new-snake-plissken-r75552.htm |title=News Russell Enraged with New Snake Plissken |publisher=Pr-inside.com |access-date=August 15, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610002318/http://www.pr-inside.com/russell-enraged-with-new-snake-plissken-r75552.htm |archive-date=June 10, 2010}}</ref>
