==Personal life==
Hammond has two children who have appeared on his 2009 album, ''[[Love Unstoppable]]''. Hammond divorced his wife of 18 years, Kim, in 2004,<ref>{{cite journal |last=Evans Price |first=Deborah |date=July 3, 2004 |title=Hammond Feels the Love as Album Shoots to No. 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA14 |page=13 |journal=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=June 20, 2015 }}</ref> and he currently resides in [[Cedar Hill, Texas]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Hammond revealed on the ''Donnie McClurkin Show'' that his mother confessed to him three months before she died that she had [[Abortion|attempted to have him aborted]]. The procedure, done in 1960, before abortions were legal, failed. Hammond's mother returned for a second attempt but decided against the procedure; Hammond was later born in December 1960.<ref>[http://loop21.com/entertainment/fred-hammond-says-he-was-nearly-aborted My Mom Nearly Aborted Me] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120211232411/http://loop21.com/entertainment/fred-hammond-says-he-was-nearly-aborted |date=February 11, 2012 }}</ref>

One of Hammond's nephews is [[Utah Jazz]] [[Guard (basketball)|guard]] [[Emmanuel Mudiay]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fred Hammond on Instagram: "Hung with the nephew earlier today.
