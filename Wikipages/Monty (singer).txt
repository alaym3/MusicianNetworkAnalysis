Many of his hit singles were [[arrangement|arranged]] by [[Jacques Loussier]].  Monty often wrote his own lyrics to the tunes of American pop songs, and became a writer of songs for other artists including [[Éric Charden]] ("Le monde est gris, le monde est bleu"), [[Sheila (singer)|Sheila]] ("Petite fille de français moyen"), [[France Gall]] ("Mon p'tit soldat"), and [[Dalida]] ("Mama").
