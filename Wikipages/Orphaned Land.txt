'''Orphaned Land''' is an Israeli [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band, formed in 1991 under the name Resurrection (changing their name in 1992 to the current name), that combines [[Israeli Jewish]], [[Mizrahi Jewish|Mizrahi]], and other West Asian influences. They are considered 'The pioneers of Oriental Metal'{{By whom|date=December 2017}}. The band has gone through several lineup changes over the years, but has retained two of the founding members, [[Kobi Farhi]] ([[vocals]]) and Uri Zelcha ([[bass guitar|bass]]).  They are joined by Matan Shmuely ([[drums]]), Chen Balbus ([[guitar]]/[[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]) who replaced co-founding member Matti Svatizky in 2012, and Idan Amsalem ([[guitars]]/[[bouzouki]]) who replaced co-founding member Yossi Sassi in early 2014. Their lyrics promote a message of peace and unity, particularly between the three main Abrahamic religions ([[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Christianity]]).

[[File:Kobi Farhi. Zug 2018.jpg| [[Kobi Farhi]], lead vocalist|thumb]]
In 1992, the band changed its name from the original Resurrection<ref name=MusicMight>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/israel/orphaned+land|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415101027/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/israel/orphaned+land|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 15, 2012|title=MusicMight :: Artists :: ORPHANED LAND|date=April 15, 2012}}</ref> to Orphaned Land.
Orphaned Land fuse [[progressive metal|progressive]], [[doom metal|doom]], and [[death metal]] as well as [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] [[folk music]] and Arabic traditions in a form of [[Oriental metal]]. Each album has some concept related to two extremes: a meeting of [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], [[past]] and [[present]], [[light]] and [[darkness]], and [[God]] and [[Satan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.orphaned-land.com/default.php?language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050204063604/http://www.orphaned-land.com/default.php?language=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 4, 2005|date=February 4, 2005}}</ref>

The band’s first album was ''[[Sahara (Orphaned Land album)|''Sahara'']]'' (1994) which was originally released as a [[demo album|demo]]. The second album, ''[[El Norra Alila]]'' (1996), had many Eastern/Oriental influences, such as "El Norra Alila" ("Illustrious God"), based on a poem sung during [[Yom Kippur]] as a plea of forgiveness. It also included songs with traditional oriental Jewish ''[[piyyut]]'' and Arabic melodies. The album explored the themes of light and darkness, as well as conveying the message of commonality between the three main Abrahamic religions ([[Judaism]], [[Islam]], and [[Christianity]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.orphaned-land.com/content.php?language=en&menu=the_band&section=concept&theme=seven |title=Concept -> The Concept of El Norra Alila |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112030459/http://www.orphaned-land.com/content.php?language=en&menu=the_band&section=concept&theme=seven |archive-date=November 12, 2007 }}</ref>

The third album, ''[[Mabool|Mabool: The Story of the Three Sons of Seven]]'' (the Hebrew name for the [[flood myth|Deluge]], depicted in the [[Bible]] and [[Noah]]'s story), released in 2004, was seven years in the making. It tells the story of three sons (one for each [[Abrahamic religion]]) who try to warn humanity of a flood coming as punishment for their sins. Musically, the album contains oriental instruments, two choruses, traditional [[Music of Yemen|Yemenite chants]] sung by [[Shlomit Levi]], and quotes of biblical verses from the story of the deluge, read by vocalist Kobi Farhi. After ''Mabool'', Orphaned Land released an EP, ''[[Ararat (EP)|Ararat]]'' (2005) named after [[Mount Ararat]]. Despite their songs drawing on biblical themes, the band have said that they are not religious, with the majority of the band members identifying as atheist or agnostic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://squatneysteel.wordpress.com/2010/06/13/interview-matti-svatizky-orphaned-land/ |title=Interview: Matti Svatizky, Orphaned Land – MuchMoreMetal.com |website=Squatneysteel.wordpress.com |date=2010-06-13 |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalindiamagazine.com/interviews/interview-with-orphaned-land |title=Interview with Orphaned Land |publisher=MetalIndia Magazine |date=2012-01-29 |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN4btjJzlAs#t=1402s |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>

On January, 2010, Orphaned Land released the follow-up to ''Mabool'', entitled ''[[The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR]]''. ''ORWarriOR'' means "Warrior of Light", and the concept is the battle between light and darkness. The album has a different sound than ''Mabool'', and was mixed by [[Steven Wilson]] of [[Porcupine Tree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/band.php?id=2309 |title=Orphaned Land - Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=[[The Metal Archives]] |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> The first single from the CD was titled "Sapari" and was put on [[Myspace]] with two other tracks, "Vayehi OR" and "Disciples of the Sacred Oath II". In early 2011, ''ORWarriOR'' was rated the [[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]] number one progressive metal album of 2010 by users with 421/1130 total votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/awards/categories.php?cat_id=16|title=Metal Storm Awards 2010 Progressive Metal |website=Metalstorm.net|access-date=2011-04-16}}</ref>

In 2008, Orphaned Land was featured in the documentary ''[[Global Metal]]'', a film by the creators of ''[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/events/news_comments.php?news_id=6956 |title=Orphaned Land - New Album On The Way - Metal Storm |website=Metalstorm.ee |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref>

On May 22, 2010, Orphaned Land performed as the opening act to [[Metallica]]'s show in [[Israel]]. Following this, the band went on a festival tour in the summer of 2010, promoting their latest album, ''The Never Ending Way of ORWarriOR'', with appearances at such festivals as [[Wacken Open Air]], [[Summer Breeze Open Air]], [[Sonisphere Festival]], [[Gods of Metal]], [[Rock Hard Festival]] and more. After the summer festival tour, the band will go on a North American tour in support of [[Katatonia]], along with [[Swallow the Sun]]. This will be followed by a tour of Europe supporting [[Amorphis]] along with [[Ghost Brigade (band)|Ghost Brigade]].

They performed on June 19, 2011, at the French Metal Festival [[Hellfest (French music festival)|Hellfest]] held in Clisson, near Nantes. In February 2011, they performed at the Riviera cultural festival at [[Vellore Institute of Technology|VIT University]], [[Vellore]], [[India]]. And in February 2012, they performed at the festival [[Alcheringa (festival)|Alcheringa]] at [[Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati]] (IIT), [[India]].

On June 11, 2012, guitarist Matty Svatitzky announced his departure from the band, due to personal issues. Matti Svatitzky was replaced by Chen Balbus, a young musician who was a replacement guitar player for some live shows, before he became an official member. Chen instantly became an integral part of the composing, writing, producing and recording of the new album, "[[All Is One (album)|All Is One]]."{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 2012 there was an online petition for Orphaned Land to be awarded a Nobel Prize for their commitment to allowing the Arab World to listen to their music despite bans on such a thing from Arab League countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OrphanedLandOfficial/posts/10151916501618036 |title=Nominate Orphaned Land for the 2018 Nobel Peace Prize |website=Facebook.com|date=2012-10-23 |access-date=2012-10-23}}</ref>

Orphaned Land's fifth album, entitled [[All Is One (album)|All is One]], was released on June 21, 2013, and worldwide on the 25th. The previous vocalist, Shlomit Levy did not perform on this album, so female vocals were performed instead by [[Mira Awad]]. Despite its optimistic title, the band considers it their darkest album thematically, albeit musically their most accessible, being nearly devoid of death metal influence.

On January 7, 2014, Orphaned Land announced on their [[Facebook]] page that it had parted ways with guitarist and co-founding member [[Yossi Sassi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/OrphanedLandOfficial/posts/10151916501618036 |title=Orphaned Land - Orphaned Land and Yossi Sassi part ways:... |publisher=[[Facebook]] |date=2014-01-06 |access-date=2017-03-02}}</ref> He was replaced by guitarist Idan Amsalem.

Orphaned Land recently won [[Metal Hammer]] award for "Global Metal Band of the Year 2014".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=12563|work=Knac.com |date=Aug 25, 2014 |title=ORPHANED LAND Premieres "Let The Truce Be Known" Video}}</ref> The band also released a new music video for the track "Let the Truce Be Known" which is directed by Vadim Machona.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=105189 |work=Metalunderground.com |date=Aug 25, 2014 |title=New Music Video "Let The Truce Be Known" Released By Orphaned Land}}</ref>

In 2017, [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] guitarist [[Steve Hackett]] called Kobi Farhi. He was looking for artists that work for peace between people, and unsurprisingly, he chose Orphaned Land. The two sides immediately clicked and started collaborating. Together with the highly acclaimed Israeli-Arab singer, [[Mira Awad]], Farhi sings on Hackett’s album, “[[The Night Siren]]” and on the song, “West to East”. Later on, Hackett continued to work with Orphaned Land and recorded a guitar solo for the band’s new album,<ref>[http://www.playbuzz.com/lemurmagazine10/orphaned-land-collaborates-with-genesis-guitar-legend-steve-hackett Orphaned Land Collaborates With Genesis' Guitar Legend, Steve Hackett] (Playbuzz, April 2017)</ref> which was released on January 26, 2018, entitled ''Unsung Prophets & Dead Messiahs''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/orphaned-land-announce-new-studio-album-for-release-in-january-2018|title=ORPHANED LAND ANNOUNCE NEW STUDIO ALBUM FOR RELEASE IN JANUARY 2018|publisher=[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]]|access-date=July 6, 2017|date=July 6, 2017}}</ref> In September 2018, Orphaned Land won the 'Video Of The Year’ award At the Progressive Music Awards 2018 in London, for their video, “Like Orpheus".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalshockfinland.com/2018/09/14/orphaned-land-win-video-of-the-year-at-progressive-music-awards-2018/|title=ORPHANED LAND: Win 'Video Of The Year' At Progressive Music Awards 2018|website=Metalshockfinland.com|access-date=September 14, 2018|date=September 14, 2018}}</ref>
