After taking a break, Laleh returned to release her third studio album in 2009, ''[[Me and Simon]]''. It contained a more folk pop sound than previous rock or soul-tinged tracks which has been attributed to the surroundings of moving from a big city to the northern Swedish town of [[Skellefteå]] in 2006. One of the nature reserves in the town was her inspiration for "[[Bjurö klubb]]".<ref name="DN"/> It was met with mixed to positive reviews by Swedish critics.<ref name="Kritiker Me and Simon">{{cite web |url=http://kritiker.se/skivor/recension/?skiva=Laleh__-__Me_And_Simon |title=29 recensioner av Laleh: Me and Simon|language=sv |publisher=Kritiker.se |access-date=9 February 2012}}</ref> The first single released from the album "[[Simon Says (Laleh song)|Simon Says]]" peaked at number forty-one on the Swedish Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Laleh&titel=Simon+Says&cat=s |title=swedishcharts.com – Laleh – Simon Says |publisher=swedishcharts.com |access-date=9 February 2012}}</ref> Due to strong downloads from the album, the first track from the LP, "Big City Love", also charted at number thirty-two.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://swedishcharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Laleh&titel=Big+City+Love&cat=s |title=swedishcharts.com – Laleh – Big City Love |publisher=swedishcharts.com|access-date=9 February 2012}}</ref> It was later released as a single in May 2009 but failed to return to the chart. Two further releases, "Bjurö klubb" and "Mysteries" failed to chart at the time.

During these years, Laleh toured in several Scandinavian countries, Britain and Germany but has previously hinted that she is hesitant to launch overseas, saying she wants to be more prepared and develop fully as an artist.

===2011–2012: Så mycket bättre and ''Sjung''===
