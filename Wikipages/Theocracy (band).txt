'''Theocracy''' is an American [[Christian metal|Christian]] [[progressive metal|progressive]] [[power metal]] band founded in 2002 by Matt Smith of [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. They have released four albums and multiple Christmas singles.

== Background ==
The group started as a one-man project with all the instruments and vocals on the debut album ''Theocracy'' performed by Smith.  Musically, the band mixes the [[power metal]] style of [[Edguy]], [[Iced Earth]], and [[Helloween]] with progressive influences from bands such as [[Dream Theater]], [[Symphony X]], [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] and [[Rush (band)|Rush]].

The group performed at the [[ProgPower USA|ProgPower USA VII]] festival Pre-Party in [[Atlanta]], Georgia. Live performances from the show of the songs "The Serpent's Kiss" and "Mountain" were included on the ProgPower VII DVD.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lucidloungestudios.com/ProgPower7TheDVD/DVDProgress.htm |title=ProgPower The DVD Progress Report |publisher=Lucidloungestudios.com |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206032653/http://www.lucidloungestudios.com/ProgPower7TheDVD/DVDProgress.htm |archivedate=February 6, 2012  }}</ref>

The band's self-titled album was released on January 1, 2003 by MetalAges Records. All instruments were played by Matt Smith. The album had been out of print for several years, and fans have asked for a re-issue. In order to improve upon the drum machine and amateur production of the original release without losing the charm of the recordings, Theocracy drummer Shawn Benson recorded drums on all tracks, while nothing else was re-recorded. Smith completely re-mixed the album, with the mastering handled by Mika Jussila, and on November 19, 2013, Ulterium Records re-released it.

Their second album, ''[[Mirror of Souls]]'', was Theocracy's first album as a full band.  It was released on November 21, 2008 through Sweden's Ulterium Records and on November 26, 2008 in Japan by Soundholic Records.  The Japanese version contains the bonus track "Wages of Sin." The North American edition was released December 9, 2008. A picture disc LP was released through the record label's web store containing "Mirror of Souls," "Laying the Demon to Rest," "Absolution Day," and "The Wages of Sin." This LP was limited to 250 copies worldwide.

''As the World Bleeds'', was released on November 21, 2011 in North America and on November 25, 2011 in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/theocracy/721357-theocracy-world-bleeds.html |title=THEOCRACY - AS THE WORLD BLEEDS - Ultimate Metal Forum |website=Ultimatemetal.com |date=October 12, 2011 |accessdate=May 21, 2012}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=A fan forum is not a reliable source. |date=October 2016}} After releasing their new album, Theocracy released their first official music video from the new album, entitled "Hide in the Fairytale" on September 5, 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalcallout.com/metal-news/feeling-cheesy-firewind-and-theocracy-have-new-videos-out.html|title=Theocracy Have New Videos Out|publisher=Metal CallOut}}</ref>
