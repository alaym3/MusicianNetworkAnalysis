'''Björn Svante Afzelius''' (27 January 1947 in [[Huskvarna]], [[Jönköping County]] – 16 February 1999 in [[Gothenburg]]) was a Swedish singer-songwriter and guitar player. Politically, he was an outspoken [[socialist]], known for his support for [[Olof Palme]]. His songs are about love, politics and joys and sadness in life.

==Career==
His father Svante Arnold Afzelius (1923–1976) was an engineer and his mother Ulla Afzelius (1926–1971) was a housewife. His only sibling is his brother Bengt (b. 1952) who is a music teacher. He came into contact with music from a very young age, because his mother and her side of the family were largely into music. In 1970, Afzelius formed the [[progg]] group [[Hoola Bandoola Band]] together with [[Mikael Wiehe]]. Wiehe and Afzelius became very close friends and worked together long after Hoola Bandoola had dissolved in 1975.

Afzelius released his first solo album in 1974, his last one in 1999. Some of his most popular songs are "Ikaros", "Tusen bitar" (Thousand pieces – which was originally recorded by Danish [[Anne Linnet]] as "Tusind Stykker"), "Sång till friheten" (Song for Freedom – which was originally recorded by Cuban [[Silvio Rodríguez]] as "El Día Feliz Que Está Llegando"), "Kungens man" (The king's man), "Tankar i Havanna" (Thoughts in Havanna) and "Till min kära" (For my dear). He died from lung cancer in 1999, 52 years old,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/bj%C3%B6rn-afzelius-mn0000541960/biography|title=Björn Afzelius – Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=8 December 2017}}</ref> but he remains one of the most beloved artists in [[Scandinavia]].

He wrote about 150 songs and sold over two-and-a-half million albums.
