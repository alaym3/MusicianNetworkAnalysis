'''Stereolab''' are an English-French [[avant-pop]] band formed in [[London]] in 1990. Led by the songwriting team of [[Tim Gane]] and [[Lætitia Sadier]], the group's music combines influences from [[krautrock]], [[lounge music|lounge]] and 1960s [[pop music]], often incorporating a repetitive [[motorik]] beat with heavy use of vintage electronic keyboards and female vocals sung in English and French. Their lyrics have political and philosophical themes influenced by the [[Surrealist]] and [[Situationist International|Situationist]] movements. On stage, they play in a more feedback-driven and guitar-oriented style. The band also draw from [[funk]], [[jazz]] and [[Brazilian music]], and were one of the first artists to be dubbed "[[post-rock]]". They are regarded among the most innovative and influential groups of the 1990s.

Stereolab were formed by Gane (guitar and keyboards) and Sadier (vocals, keyboards and guitar) after the break-up of [[McCarthy (band)|McCarthy]]. The two were romantically involved for fourteen years and are the group's only consistent members. Other longtime members include 1992 addition [[Mary Hansen]] (backing vocals, keyboards and guitar), who died in 2002, and 1993 addition Andy Ramsay (drums). [[The High Llamas]]' leader [[Sean O'Hagan]] (guitar and keyboards) was a member from 1993 to 1994 and continued appearing on later records for occasional guest appearances.

Although Stereolab found success in the underground music scene and were influential enough to spark a renewed interest in older [[analog synthesizer|analogue instruments]], they have never had a significant commercial impact. The band were released from their recording contract with [[Elektra Records]] due to poor record sales, and their self-owned label [[Duophonic Records|Duophonic]] signed a distribution deal with [[Too Pure]] and later [[Warp Records]]. After a ten-year hiatus, the band reunited for live performances in 2019.

Gane and Sadier, along with future band manager Martin Pike, set up a record label called [[Duophonic Super 45s]] which, along with later offshoot Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, would become commonly known as "Duophonic".<ref name="H2O (Chunklet: Tim Gane)">{{cite web|url=http://www.chunklet.com/index.cfm?section=article&IssueID=8&ID=53 |website=[[Chunklet]], Issue 14 |publisher=Chunklet |title=Tim Gane (Duophonic/UHF Disks) |last=H2O |access-date=26 May 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123215624/http://chunklet.com/index.cfm?section=article&IssueID=8&ID=53 |archive-date=23 November 2010 }}</ref> Gane said that their "original plan" was to distribute multiple 7 and 10-inch records "–to just do one a month and keep doing them in small editions".<ref name="McGonical">{{cite journal |last=McGonical |first=Mike |title=Stereolab / Serene Velocity |journal=(compilation Album Booklet) R2 79533|date=August 2006}}</ref> The 10&nbsp;inch vinyl [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Super 45]]'', released in May 1991, was the first release for both Stereolab and the label, and was sold through mail order and through the [[Rough Trade Shop]] in London.

Stereolab released the EP, ''[[Super-Electric]]'' in September 1991, and a single, titled ''Stunning Debut Album'', followed in November 1991 (which was neither debut nor album). The early material was rock and guitar-oriented; of ''Super-Electric'', Jason Ankeny wrote in [[AllMusic]] that "Droning guitars, skeletal rhythms, and pop hooks—not vintage synths and pointillist melodies—were their calling cards&nbsp;..."<ref>{{cite web | last=Ankeny, Jason | url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r804005|pure_url=yes}} | website=AllMusic | title=Review (Super-Electric) | access-date=30 May 2007}}</ref> Under the independent label [[Too Pure]], the group's first full-length album, ''[[Peng!]]'' was released in May 1992.

Around this time, the line-up consisted of Gane and Sadier plus vocalist and guitarist [[Mary Hansen]], drummer Andy Ramsay, bassist Duncan Brown, and keyboardist Katharine Gifford. Hansen, born in Australia, had been in touch with Gane since his McCarthy days. After joining, she and Sadier developed a style of vocal counterpoint that distinguished Stereolab's sound.<ref name="Erlewine (AMG: Stereolab)" /><ref name="perrone" /><ref>{{cite news | last=DeRogatis, Jim | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1504869.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103034444/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1504869.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=3 November 2012 | work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]| publisher=Sun-Times News Group  | title=Great Chemistry // Stereolab Concocts a Unique Mix of Sounds | date=14 October 1993}}</ref> [[Sean O'Hagan]] of [[the High Llamas]] joined as a quick replacement for their touring keyboardist, but was invited for their next record and "was allowed to make suggestions".<ref name="ps5">{{cite web|author1=Popshifter|title=Painters Paint: The Definitive Career-Spanning Interview (to date) With The High Llamas' Sean O'Hagan (Snowbug and Buzzle Bee)|url=http://popshifter.com/2011-01-30/painters-paint-interview-with-the-high-llamas-sean-ohagan/5/|website=Popshifter|date=30 January 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225145009/http://popshifter.com/2011-01-30/painters-paint-interview-with-the-high-llamas-sean-ohagan/5/|archive-date=25 December 2017}}</ref>

===1993–2001: Critical recognition===
Stereolab introduced [[easy-listening]] elements into their sound with the EP ''[[Space Age Bachelor Pad Music]]'', released in March 1993. The work raised the band's profile and landed them a major-label American record deal with [[Elektra Records]]. Their first album under Elektra, ''[[Transient Random-Noise Bursts with Announcements]]'' (August 1993), was an underground success in both the US and the UK.<ref name="Erlewine (AMG: Stereolab)"/> Mark Jenkins commented in ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' that with the album, Stereolab "continues the glorious drones of [their] indie work, giving celestial sweep to [their] garage-rock organ pumping and rhythm-guitar strumming".<ref>{{cite news | last=Jenkins, Mark | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-974533.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005061724/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-974533.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=5 October 2007 | work=[[The Washington Post]]  | title=Acting on Pulse: Shimmery Stereolab | date=12 November 1993}}</ref> In the UK, the album was released on Duophonic Ultra High Frequency Disks, which is responsible for domestic releases of Stereolab's major albums.<ref name="H2O (Chunklet: Tim Gane)"/>

In January 1994, Stereolab achieved their first chart entry when the 1993 EP ''[[Jenny Ondioline]]'', entered at number 75 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. (Over the next three years, four more releases by the band would appear on this chart, ending with the EP ''[[Miss Modular]]'' in 1997.) Their third album, ''[[Mars Audiac Quintet]]'', was released in August 1994. The album contains the single "[[Ping Pong (EP)|Ping Pong]]", which gained press coverage for its explicitly [[Marxism|Marxist]] lyrics.<ref name="DeRogatis (1994)">{{cite news | last=DeRogatis, Jim | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4241865.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103034452/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4241865.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=3 November 2012 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | publisher=Sun-Times News Group | title=Stereolab Stands Alone With Hypnotic Drone | date=7 August 1994}}</ref><ref name="Mason (AMG: Ping Pong)">{{cite web | last=Mason, Stewart | url={{AllMusic|class=song|id=t3599445|pure_url=yes}} | website=AllMusic | title=Song Review (Ping Pong) | access-date=25 May 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Reynolds, Simon |author-link=Simon Reynolds |url=http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article_with_login.html?ArticleID=1030 |work=Melody Maker |title=Stereolab: Separation Terrorists |date=16 July 1994 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040054/http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article_with_login.html?ArticleID=1030 |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> The band focused more on pop and less on rock, resulting in what AllMusic described as "what may be the group's most accessible, tightly-written album".<ref>{{cite web | last=Phares, Heather | url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r204124|pure_url=yes}} | website=AllMusic | title=Review (Mars Audiac Quintet) | access-date=1 June 2007}}</ref> It was the last album to feature O'Hagan as a full-time member.

===Live performances===
Stereolab toured regularly to support their album releases.

Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist.<ref name="Shapiro (1996)"/><ref name="Jenkins (5 November 1999)"/><ref name="Fritch (2004)"/><ref name="Reynolds (1996)" /> Music journalist [[Simon Reynolds]] commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than "affairs of the heart".<ref name="Reynolds (1996)" /> The 1994 single "[[Ping Pong (EP)|Ping Pong]]" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views. In the song, Sadier sings "about capitalism's cruel cycles of slump and recovery" with lyrics that constitute "a plainspoken explanation of one of the central tenets of Marxian economic analysis" (said critics Reynolds and Stewart Mason, respectively).<ref name="Mason (AMG: Ping Pong)"/><ref name="Reynolds (1996)"/>

Band members have resisted attempts to link the group and its music to Marxism. In a 1999 interview, Gane stated that "none of us are Marxists&nbsp;... I've never even read Marx." Gane said that although Sadier's lyrics touch on political topics, they do not cross the line into "sloganeering".<ref name="Jenkins (5 November 1999)"/> Sadier also said that she had read very little Marx.<ref name="Stark (1999)"/> In contrast, [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], a radical political philosopher but strong critic of Marxism, has been cited as a marking influence in Sadier's thinking.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguard-online.co.uk/archive/music/stereolb.htm|title=Stereolab – Lataetia and Tim|website=Vanguard-online.co.uk|access-date=25 December 2017|archive-date=28 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228223025/http://www.vanguard-online.co.uk/archive/music/stereolb.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviler.org/2010/09/16/high-five-with-laetitia-sadier-stereolab/|title=High Five with Laetitia Sadier (Stereolab) – Reviler|last=Behm, John|date=16 September 2010|website=Reviler|access-date=25 December 2017|archive-date=26 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226022904/http://www.reviler.org/2010/09/16/high-five-with-laetitia-sadier-stereolab/|url-status=live}}</ref> The name of her side project, [[Monade]], and its debut album title, ''Socialisme ou Barbarie'', are also references to the work of Castoriadis.<ref name="Fritch (2004)"/><ref name="Phares (AMG: Monade)">{{cite web | last=Phares, Heather | url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p514220|pure_url=yes}} | website=AllMusic | title=Biography (Monade) | access-date=1 June 2007}}</ref>

Stereolab's album and song titles occasionally reference [[avant-garde]] groups and artists. Gane said that the title of their 1999 album ''[[Cobra and Phases Group Play Voltage in the Milky Night|Cobra and Phases Group…]]'' contains the names of two Surrealist organisations, "[[COBRA (avant-garde movement)|CoBrA]]" and "Phases Group",<ref name="Stark (1999)"/> The title of the song "Brakhage" from ''[[Dots and Loops]]'' (1997), is a nod to experimental filmmaker [[Stan Brakhage]].<ref name="Stark (1999)"/> Other examples are the 1992 compilation ''[[Switched On]]'', named after [[Wendy Carlos]]' 1968 album ''[[Switched-On Bach]]'',<ref>Taylor (2001), p.108</ref> and the 1993 song "[[Jenny Ondioline]]", a portmanteau of inventor [[Georges Jenny]] and his instrument the [[Ondioline]].<ref>Taylor (2001), p.109</ref>

We just want to be in control of our own music."<ref name="H2O (Chunklet: Tim Gane)"/>
