==Biography==

===Early years===
Hurt was born in [[Teoc, Mississippi|Teoc]],<ref name=linear>Cohen, Lawrence (1996). Liner notes to ''Avalon Blues: The Complete 1928 Okeh Recordings''. [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]/[[Legacy Records|Legacy]] CD.</ref> [[Carroll County, Mississippi]], and raised in [[Avalon, Mississippi]]. He taught himself to play guitar at the age of nine, stealthily playing the guitar of a friend of his mother's, who often stayed at the Hurt home while courting a woman who lived nearby. As a youth, he played [[old-time music]] for friends and at dances. He worked as a farmhand and sharecropper into the 1920s.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p379/biography|pure_url=yes}} |author=Eder, Bruce|title=Mississippi John Hurt: Biography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>

His fast, highly [[syncopation|syncopated]] style of playing was meant for dancing. On occasion, a [[medicine show]] would come through the area. Hurt recalled that one wanted to hire him: "One of them wanted me, but I said no because I just never wanted to get away from home."<ref name=linear/> In 1923, he played with the fiddle player Willie Narmour as a substitute for Narmour's regular partner, Shell Smith.<ref name="AMG"/>

===First recordings===
When Narmour got a chance to record for [[Okeh Records]] as a prize for winning first place in a 1928 fiddle contest, he recommended Hurt to Okeh producer Tommy Rockwell.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Devil's Music|author=Giles Oakley|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|page=[https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/121 121]|isbn=978-0-306-80743-5|date=1997|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devilsmusichisto00oakl_0/page/121}}</ref>  After auditioning "Monday Morning Blues" at his home, Hurt took part in two recording sessions, in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] and New York City (see Discography below).<ref name="AMG"/> While in Memphis, he recalled seeing "many, many blues singers ... [[Lonnie Johnson (musician)|Lonnie Johnson]], [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]], [[Bessie Smith]], and lots, lots more."<ref name=linear/> Hurt described his first recording session as follows:

{{blockquote|... a great big hall with only the three of us in it: me, the man [Rockwell], and the engineer. It was really something. I sat on a chair, and they pushed the microphone right up to my mouth and told me that I couldn't move after they had found the right position. I had to keep my head absolutely still. Oh, I was nervous, and my neck was sore for days after.<ref name=linear/>}}

Hurt attempted further negotiations with Okeh to record again, but his records were commercial failures. Okeh went out of business during the [[Great Depression]], and Hurt returned to Avalon and obscurity, working as a [[sharecropper]] and playing at local parties and dances.<ref name="russell"/>

=== Rediscovery and death ===
[[File:Mississippi John Hurt - grave.jpg|thumb|Hurt's grave]]
Hurt's renditions of "[[Frankie and Johnny (song)|Frankie]]" and "[[John Henry (song)|Spike Driver Blues]]" were included in ''[[Anthology of American Folk Music|The Anthology of American Folk Music]]'' in 1952 which generated considerable interest in locating him.<ref name=dahl>Dahl, Bill (1998). Liner notes to ''D.C. Blues: The Complete Library of Congress Recordings, Vol. 1''. [[Fuel 2000 Records]] CD.</ref> When a copy of "Avalon Blues" was discovered in 1963, it led [[Musicology|musicologist]] [[Richard K. Spottswood|Dick Spottswood]] to locate [[Avalon, Mississippi|Avalon]] in an [[atlas]], and ask Tom Hoskins, who was traveling that way, to enquire after Hurt. When Hoskins arrived in Avalon the first person he asked directed him to Hurt's cabin.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thevinyldistrict.com/storefront/2012/04/graded-on-a-curve-mississippi-john-hurt-last-sessions/|title=Graded on a Curve: Mississippi John Hurt, Last Sessions – The Vinyl District|date=April 17, 2012|work=The Vinyl District|access-date=February 27, 2018}}</ref>

{{blockquote|Avalon, my home town, always on my mind / Avalon, my home town.|sign=Mississippi John Hurt|source=''"Avalon Blues"''}}

Hoskins persuaded an apprehensive Hurt to perform several songs for him, to ensure that he was genuine.<ref name=dahl/> Hoskins was convinced and, seeing that Hurt's guitar playing skills were still intact, encouraged him to move to Washington, D.C., and perform for a broader audience. His performance at the 1963 [[Newport Folk Festival]] caused his star to rise in the [[folk revival]] occurring at that time.<ref name="russell"/> He performed extensively at colleges, concert halls, and coffeehouses and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]''. He also recorded three albums for [[Vanguard Records]].<ref name="russell"/> Much of his repertoire was also recorded for the [[Library of Congress]]. His fans particularly liked the [[ragtime]] songs "[[Salty Dog Blues|Salty Dog]]" and "Candy Man" and the blues [[ballad]]s "Spike Driver Blues" (a variant of "John Henry") and "Frankie".<ref name="russell"/>

Hurt's influence spanned several music genres, including blues, spirituals, [[country music|country]], [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], folk, and contemporary rock and roll. A soft-spoken man, his nature was reflected in the work, which consisted of a mellow mix of country, blues, and old-time music.<ref name="AMG"/>

Hurt died on November 2, 1966, of a heart attack, in hospital at [[Grenada, Mississippi]].<ref name="bare"/> His last recordings had been done at a hotel in New York City in February and July of that year, and were not released until 1972 on the Vanguard LP ''[[Last Sessions (Mississippi John Hurt album)|Last Sessions]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: H|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=H&bk=70|access-date=February 26, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

==Style==
Hurt used a fast, syncopated fingerpicking style of guitar playing that he taught himself. He was influenced by few other musicians, among whom was an elderly, unrecorded blues singer from the area where he lived, Rufus Hanks, who played [[twelve-string guitar]] and harmonica.<ref name=linear/> He also recalled listening to the [[country music|country]] singer [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]]. On occasion, Hurt would use an open tuning and a [[Slide guitar|slide]], as he did in his arrangement of "[[The Ballad of Casey Jones]]".<ref name=linear/><ref name=dahl/> According to the music critic [[Robert Christgau]], "the school of [[John Fahey (musician)|John Fahey]] proceeded from his finger-picking, and while he's not the only quietly conversational singer in the modern folk tradition, no one else has talked the blues with such delicacy or restraint."<ref>{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|date=March 11, 1997|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv297-97.php|title=Consumer Guide|newspaper=[[The Village Voice]]|location=New York|access-date=July 21, 2013}}</ref>
