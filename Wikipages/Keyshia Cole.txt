"[[Anita Baker]], her voice is incredible and her lyrics are deep. Really listen to them. [...] [[Big Daddy Kane]], the original...you can't think Brooklyn or door knockers and not think Big Daddy Kane, smooth operator: one of hip-hop's pioneers. [[LL Cool J]], one of the first MC's to really dissect lyrics and turn them inside out; and he made it sexy! [[MC Lyte]], the female MC that rhymes in such a way that you don't care if she was male or female...her voice tone is crazy, and her lyrical game bananas. [[Queen Latifah]], she represented the strong female MC, she showed us and taught us about flow and lyrical dexterity. [[Kid 'n Play]], they showed you how to take your rap game to the next level...movies!"

== Controversies ==
A feud between Cole and R&B singer [[Lil' Mo]] began in August 2005 via the radio series ''[[WWPR-FM|Star and Buc Wild Morning Show]]''. Mo was reported to have dismissed the vocal talent of a new crop of R&B performers, saying that they relied on dancing. Cole took offense and went to Dream Hotel in New York City, where she encountered Lil' Mo's manager Phil Thornton and a stylist, allegedly stating "You all are traitors. [Lil' Mo] is the enemy.".<ref name="aol" /> Lil' Mo shrugged off the incident, saying she was told that Cole was intoxicated at the time,<ref name="aol">{{Cite web |url=http://blackvoices.aol.com/black_entertainment/bvbuzzcanvas?id=20050822102109990001 |title=Inside the Buzz |last=Murray |first=Jawn |date=August 23, 2005 |website=AOL Black Voices |publisher=[[AOL]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208102322/http://blackvoices.aol.com/black_entertainment/bvbuzzcanvas?id=20050822102109990001 |archive-date=February 8, 2006 |access-date=January 16, 2014}}</ref> which Cole denied.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.crunktastical.net/2005/10/15/buzz-notes-31/ |title=Buzz Notes > Keyshia "Troll" Cole Clears The Air |date=October 15, 2005 |website=Crunk + Disorderly |publisher=crunktastical.net |access-date=January 16, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203090008/http://www.crunktastical.net/2005/10/15/buzz-notes-31/ |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

On March 16, 2012, Cole came at [[Gucci Mane]] for the controversial song "Truth", on which Gucci rapped, "I did a song with Keyshia Cole and I know you still miss her. But Puff was f---ing her while you was falling in love with her." implying that, during the time of her rumored relationship with [[Young Jeezy]], Cole was cheating on Jeezy with rap mogul and her "[[Last Night (Diddy song)|Last Night]]" collaborator [[Diddy (entertainer)|Diddy]]. Cole stated on the radio, "Putting all ya trust in some of these 'Hood Rappers'... How you gonna be a G, and you spreading lies, to sell mix tapes! Where ya talent at. Dude ain't have to lie though! Could've kept me out of it."<ref>{{cite web|last=Loren |first=Arielle |url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2012/10/16/keyshia-cole-gucci-mane-lied-about-my-love-life.html |title=Keyshia Cole: Gucci Mane Lied About My Love Life &#124; News |publisher=BET |access-date=2013-05-26}}</ref>
