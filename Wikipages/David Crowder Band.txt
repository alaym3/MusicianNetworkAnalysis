'''David Crowder Band''' (stylized as '''David Crowder*Band''' and '''The David Crowder*Band''') was a six-piece [[Christian rock]] and [[contemporary worship|modern worship]] band from [[Waco, Texas]]. Their final album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Christian and No.&nbsp;2 on the Billboard 200 charts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/507160/david-crowder-band-dominate-christian-charts |title=David Crowder Band Dominate Christian Charts |publisher=billboard.com |access-date=February 15, 2012}}</ref> They disbanded in 2012, with David Crowder pursuing a solo career under the name [[Crowder (musician)|Crowder]] and the rest of the band, except for Mike Hogan, forming [[The Digital Age]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/januaryweb-only/david-crowder-last-words-interview.html|title=Interview: David Crowder's Last Words|first=Mark|last=Moring|website=ChristianityToday.com}}</ref>

==Name==
Prior to the album ''Church Music'', the band preferred not to be referred to as "''The'' David Crowder*Band". They explained that they preferred to omit the article, and stated that they "may revisit this issue if other groups named 'David Crowder*Band' begin performing," and may in fact, should that eventuality occur, insert "The Original" in front of the band's present appellation. As of the release of ''Church Music'', however, the band has begun referring to themselves using the article, and explained "we’ve been at for a while now without incident, so we felt justified in its formal inclusion."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoachedegg.net/the-poached-egg/2011/03/david-crowder-stuff-christian-bands-like.html |title=David Crowder: Stuff Christian Bands Like |publisher=Thepoachedegg.net |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

The band's name is usually rendered with an asterisk, as "David Crowder*Band". In a faux-documentary, while recording ''Church Music'', Crowder joked that the asterisk meant, "David Crowder [is about to go insane because Jack Parker continually tries to sabotage the work of the rest of the] band."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJie0fedIeY |title=David Crowder*Band Rockumentary 2: You Can Bet Your Life On It |publisher=YouTube |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

==Band history==
The band began when Crowder realized that almost half of the students at [[Baylor University]], a Christian university, were not attending church. Finding this very surprising he and Chris Seay started University Baptist Church (Waco, Texas) in 1995, while he was still a student. Crowder became pastor of worship at the church and led worship and continued to do so throughout the year. The church's congregation grew, as did the band's lineup.

Crowder began writing songs to incorporate into the worship times at the church and eventually the church released an [[Indie (music)|independent CD]], ''Pour Over Me'', followed by ''All I Can Say'' in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} These CDs brought the band to a wider audience and invitations to festivals and events followed. The band was signed to [[sixstepsrecords]]/[[Sparrow Records]] when Louie Giglio talked to Crowder about the music and how it could be used more than just at UBC and more worldwide. Although the band toured extensively, they made it a point to be back at their home church UBC in [[Waco]] Texas for most Sundays.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

[[Kyle Lake]], University Baptist Church's former pastor and also longtime friend of the band, had a strong influence on the band's music in terms of content and inspiration both during his life and after Lake's death.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

With their September 2005 release, ''[[A Collision|A Collision or (3+4=7)]]'', David Crowder Band explored a new realm of musical diversity. The album houses a mix of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[folk music|folk]], [[Alternative rock|alternative]], and [[Christianity#Weekly worship services|worship]], woven together with a touch of [[Ambient music|electronic ambience]]. This release landed them the No.&nbsp;2 spot on the [[iTunes Music Store]] and the No.&nbsp;39 spot on [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]  the second day after its release. The same day as the release of ''A Collision'', their song "Turkish Delight" was released on the ''[[Music Inspired by the Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe|Music Inspired by the Chronicles of Narnia]]'' compilation CD. This song, which is a reference to the magical [[Turkish Delight]] in [[C. S. Lewis]]'s book ''[[The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe]]'', has an old-school disco feel.

March 19, 2007, the band officially started recording ''[[Remedy (David Crowder Band album)|Remedy]]''; the band also revealed the album's website, which allowed fans to follow the band via live webcams, and discover more about the album. [[Ted Nugent]] made a guest appearance on the album, on the song "We Won't Be Quiet". ''Remedy'' was  released on September 25, 2007. The day after its release, it reached No.&nbsp;4 on the [[iTunes Music Store]]. When Mark Waldrop joined the band as the album ''Remedy'' was released, his sidekick Rupert came with him. Rupert is a gnome.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/rupert.remarkable|title=Rupert Remarkable|website=Facebook.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/ruperttheremarkable|title=Rupert Gnome (ruperttheremarkable) on Myspace|website=Myspace}}</ref> During the Remedy Tour the band had up a live web feed on Crowder's Xanga account. The feed had a chat room where fans chatted live with the band and their tourmates. It showed more than half of the tour stops live which included their tour bus, live stage feeds of shows, places the band went, etc. Much of the time the video feed would be on Rupert at different stops. On the final night of the tour Phil Wickham and The Myriad came on stage for a hoe down for the song "I Saw the light". The camera for the feed was on the lid of a ball-cap and was wired into a laptop the band had in a backpack; this equipment was provided by Xanga. The band also used the feed for some time after their Remedy Tour.
July 16, 2008, the band announced it would be releasing a live album and DVD titled ''[[Remedy Club Tour - Live]]'',<ref>[http://www.davidcrowderband.com/news/articles.php3?newsid=000236 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728074243/http://www.davidcrowderband.com/news/articles.php3?newsid=000236 |date=July 28, 2008 }}</ref> The DVD was filmed In NYC and GA.

Crowder's Xanga entry from January 31, 2009, mentioned the preproduction of the band's next studio album. Also on Mike Hogan's MySpace entry from March 4, 2009, he confirmed that actual recording and production had commenced and provided directions for getting to the live webcam feed, which is in a page simply titled "Church Music".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dcb01.com/churchmusic/cams.php4 |title=dcb01.com |publisher=dcb01.com |access-date=January 13, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006174648/http://dcb01.com/churchmusic/cams.php4 |archive-date=October 6, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The album was titled "Church Music" and was  released on September 22, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jesusfreakhideout.com/releases/default.asp#sept09 |title=Album Release Dates, CD New Releases |publisher=Jesusfreakhideout.com |access-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref> The first single off the album was a cover of [[John Mark McMillan]]'s song "[[How He Loves]]". Crowder received permission from McMillan to change the words "So heaven meets earth like a sloppy wet kiss" to "So heaven meets earth like an unforeseen kiss".

The band hosted Crowder's Fantastical Church Music Conference September 30 through October 2, 2010 at [[Baylor University]] in [[Waco, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidcrowderband.com/fantastical/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=November 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325200135/http://www.davidcrowderband.com/fantastical/ |archive-date=March 25, 2011 }}</ref> Other presenters at the conference included [[Louie Giglio]], [[Rob Bell]], [[Israel Houghton]], [[Hillsong London]], [[Matt Redman]], [[Jars of Clay]], [[Matt Maher]], [[Leeland (band)|Leeland]], [[David Dark]], [[Gungor]], [[Derek Webb]], and [[Isaac Wardell]].

==Unusual Instrumentation==
The band often incorporated unconventional instruments and elements into their music, many of which were created by the band's drummer Jeremy Bush. He modified a [[Speak & Spell (toy)|Speak & Spell]] for the song "I Can Hear the Angels Singing (...Andeverandeverand...)", and used a robot drummer, named Steve 3PO, for use in "Church Music", a silver box with blue lights and switches for "Can You Feel It?", and a MOTM [[modular synthesizer]] used by Hogan. He also manufactured a seven square-foot MPC style-MIDI controller for the band [[Family Force 5]]. 

A guitar-shaped controller from the [[Guitar Hero]] game was used in "... neverending ...".  According to Crowder, the controller was transformed to a MIDI instrument. Jeremy "B-Wack" Bush programmed the controller such that each of the buttons were put into USB Overdrive, an application for reading signals off of USB devices. The buttons were programmed to each specific chord in the song "...neverending...". Once the buttons were programmed and sent to USB Overdrive, the results were put in to [[Ableton Live]] as a MIDI note programmed by the band. There were 12 samples in the controller.  

Hogan often played turntables and played electric violin with guitar effects. A [[Smule]] "I Am T-Pain" [[iPhone]] app is used on "The Nearness".{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=I have seen all of these used in concert, but we need a reliable source for this. No, a YouTube video won't do.}} On incorporating bluegrass into the band's repertoire, Crowder stated that the banjo was something he had previously wanted to avoid "at all costs".<ref>{{cite news |last=Copley |first=Rich |date=2006-07-07 |title=Crowder discovers bluegrass |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&dat=20060707&id=TY0_AAAAIBAJ&pg=3917,5895187&hl=en |newspaper=[[The Victoria Advocate]] |location=Victoria, Texas |access-date=2016-02-16}}</ref>

The band often recorded their albums in a barn behind Crowder's house.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012|reason=a third-party reference or a direct primary reference--not a video--that indicates the barn is behind Crowder's house.}}
