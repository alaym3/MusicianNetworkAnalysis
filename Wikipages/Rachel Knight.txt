=== Newton Knight and the Free State of Jones ===
Not much is known about the details of Rachel's life. Towards the end of the American Civil War, she helped [[Newton Knight]], grandson of John "Jackie" Knight, evade capture by Confederate forces after his desertion from the army. Newton's story was portrayed in the 2016 film ''Free State of Jones'' where Newton was portrayed by [[Matthew McConaughey]] and Rachel was depicted by [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]. While Newton was initially married to Serena Turner, he eventually was separated from her and married Rachel. Together Newton and Rachel had two children, Martha Ann in 1865 and John Stewart in 1868.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

=== Rachel's Membership in the Church of Jesus Christ of Later-day Saints ===
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints began proselytizing in the South, Jones county in particular in the early 1880s. Rachel was baptized a member of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] on February 2, 1881, by Elam Wells McBride and was confirmed by William Thompson Jr.<ref name=":0" /> Her daughter Martha Ann was also baptized in 1882 and John Stewart was baptized twelve years later in 1891. Knight family researcher Kenneth Welch claims "Rachel traveled out to Utah but came back to Mississippi because it was too cold."<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://renegadesouth.wordpress.com/2009/09/11/part-2-yvonne-bivins-on-the-history-of-rachel-knight/|title=Part 2: Yvonne Bivins on the History of Rachel Knight|last=renegadesouth|date=2009-09-11|website=Renegade South|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>

=== Later life ===
According to United States census data, Rachel remained in [[Jasper County, Mississippi]] with Newton until her passing in 1889. According to family members "she died from having too many babies too close together",<ref name=":1" /> as she had delivered a child every two years from the time she was fourteen. Rachel was buried in the Knight family cemetery-one of the few interracial cemeteries in the state-and Newton would later be buried beside her.<ref>The American Slave: A Composite Autobiography, Supplement, Series 1. Vol. X: Mississippi Narrative, Pt. 5.</ref>

== Legacy ==
Many of Rachel's children were encouraged by Newton to marry someone who was as close to white as possible, wanting to "erase that one drop of Negro blood in their veins."<ref name=":1" /> The Knight family mothered by Rachel grew to have a reputation as the "white Negroes" of Mississippi due to their light skin color and straight hair.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|url=https://renegadesouth.wordpress.com/2009/09/06/yvonne-bivins-on-the-history-of-rachel-knight/|title=Part 1: Yvonne Bivins on the History of Rachel Knight|last=renegadesouth|date=2009-09-06|website=Renegade South|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> As most of Rachel's later descendants were [[Passing (racial identity)|white passing]], they fled to other states to start new lives in the 1920s and 1930s, enjoying opportunities that were unavailable to African Americans at the time .<ref name=":2" />

=== Davis Knight ===
Rachel's great-grandson, Davis Knight, married Junie Lee Spradley, a white woman in 1946. Two years later Davis was charged with violating the Mississippi state constitution that stated "the marriage of a white person with a negro or mulatto, or person who shall have one-eighth or more of negro blood, shall be unlawful and void."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/103/index.php?s=extra&id=270|title=Mississippi History Now {{!}} The Mississippi Constitution of 1890 as originally adopted|website=mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> During his trial, Davis asserted to the court that he was white as "his wife believed him to be white and his Navy service records listed him as white."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=http://calendar.eji.org/racial-injustice/apr/18|title=Apr. 18, 1946 {{!}} Davis Knight Weds White Woman; Later Indicted for Interracial Marriage|last=MADEO|website=calendar.eji.org|language=en|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref> Initially the court proclaimed that because his great-grandmother, Rachel, was considered "a negro" that implicated Davis at least one-eighth Black and therefore was in violation of the law. This is an example of Mississippi's "[[One-drop rule|one drop rule]]" which states that if an individual has any Black or African ancestry, they will be considered legally Black.<ref>Bynum, Victoria E., 1998. "'White Negroes' in Segregated Mississippi: Miscegenation, Racial Identity, and the Law." The Journal of Southern History, 6 (3): 247-276. https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2587946.pdf?refreqid=excelsior%3A6dff359d38975d05b062b12a0e3b83e5</ref> He was sentenced to five years in prison. In 1949, Davis appealed his case and "the Supreme Court of Mississippi reversed his conviction."<ref name="auto"/> The Mississippi state laws against interracial marriage were nullified by the United States Supreme Court when it passed ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' in 1967 and formally repealed in the 1980s.
