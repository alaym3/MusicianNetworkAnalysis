==History==
===Formation and early years (1995–1999)===
The members of Trapt met in middle school in the mid-'90s, and were in an early [[NOFX]] cover band called the Swinging Udders, with Manny Terres on guitar and Aaron Azlant on lead vocals. Shortly thereafter, the band reformed and developed an act with Chris Taylor Brown (lead vocals), Simon Ormandy (guitar), Peter "Pete" Charell (bass), and David Stege (drums). The band's first few rehearsals were in Ormandy's guesthouse, which had a party-like atmosphere with its loft overlooking the living room.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-2356/2002-09-12-breaking_free+wiki|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090110021815/http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-2356/2002-09-12-breaking_free+wiki|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 10, 2009|title=Trapt History|work=Synthesis|date=September 12, 2002}}</ref> They began playing at local venues in 1997 before any members had graduated high school. In 1998, still before graduation, they were already opening for up-and-coming fellow acts like [[Papa Roach]].<ref name="AMG"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shavemagazine.com/entertainment/080801|title=Interview With Trapt|work=[[Shave (magazine)|Shave Magazine]]|author=Abe|date=August 1, 2008|access-date=February 4, 2012}}</ref> They recorded and released their first CD, ''Amalgamation'', in 1999, which they sold at their live shows.  Their second release, the ''Glimpse EP'', came in 2000, and another EP, 2001's self-titled ''Trapt'', served as the band's demo.

The debut independent release by Trapt, ''Amalgamation'', released in June 1999 and sold only in the Los Gatos, California area.{{cn|date=December 2020}}

===''Trapt'' (2001–2003)===

===''Someone in Control'' (2004–2006)===
Before releasing their next full-length album, the band released a self-titled three-track EP, released March 30, 2004, that included live versions of the "Made of Glass" and "Echo" tracks from their debut album, as well as a previously unreleased non-LP track, "Promise".

==Social media use==
Many publications have taken note of the band's unusual use of [[social media]] accounts, run by Brown, often to lash out and attack others, something not often done from official band accounts. Music website ''[[Metal Sucks]]'' noted in 2015 that the band's official [[Facebook]] account made lengthy posts criticizing viewers of ''[[Keeping Up with the Kardashians]]'', which devolved into the account swearing and berating commenters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2015/07/20/trapt-frontman-goes-just-worst-facebook-rant/|title=Trapt Frontman Goes On Just The Worst Facebook Rant|last=Rhombus|first=Emperor|date=2015-07-20|website=MetalSucks|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> The comment also included [[homophobic]] insults towards internet musician [[Rob Scallon]], whom the band had feuded with on social media earlier in the year over the unauthorized and unattributed use of Scallon's videos.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2015/02/17/least-shocking-news-ever-day-dudes-trapt-total-d-bags/|title=Least Shocking News Ever of the Day: The Dudes in Trapt are Total D-Bags|date=2015-02-17|website=MetalSucks|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2015/07/18/news/trapts-frontman-sparred-with-fans-made-some-very-questionable-statements-on-facebook/|title=Trapt's Frontman Sparred With Fans & Made Some Very Questionable Statements On Facebook|date=2015-07-18|website=Theprp.com|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> In 2017, Brown insulted commenters who disagreed with his defense of [[President Trump]]'s [[dismissal of James Comey]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2017/05/12/trump-loving-trapt-frontman-is-fighting-with-people-on-facebook-about-the-james-comey-fbi-scandal/|title=Trump-Loving TRAPT Frontman is Fighting with People on Facebook About the James Comey FBI Scandal|date=2017-05-12|website=MetalSucks|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> and then again later in the year with critics of Brown's stance that [[institutional racism]] does not exist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2017/09/08/trapt-frontman-is-still-fighting-with-fans-on-facebook-does-not-understand-what-racism-is/|title=Trapt Frontman is Still Fighting with Fans on Facebook, Does Not Understand What Racism Is|last=Neilstein|first=Vince|date=2017-09-08|website=MetalSucks.net|access-date=2020-03-19}}</ref> 

In March 2020, ''Metal Injection'', ''[[The A.V.

In August 2020, in response to an article by music publication ''[[Consequence of Sound]]'' that asserted that the band drew a small crowd size at a festival, the band took to Twitter to berate the publication and any fans who agreed with the story's claim of poor attendance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/08/trapt-crowd-buffalo-chip/|title=Trapt's Buffalo Chip concert drew the largest crowd ever to witness a concert, period.|website=Consequenceofsound.com|date=August 10, 2020|access-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> The following month, the band's account was used to publicly berate Travis Livingston, an artist the band had commissioned, but not paid, for a lyric video for their album release that year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/trapt-judge-judy-appearance/|title=Here's why Trapt might end up on a 'Judge Judy' episode|first=Rachael|last=Dowd|website=Altpress.com|date=September 11, 2020|access-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> In October 2020, the band drew criticism when they announced their support for the far-right extremist group the [[Proud Boys]] and invited the group's Dallas, Texas chapter to their next show in town.<ref>{{Cite web|date=29 October 2020|title=Trapt Frontman Chris Taylor Brown Invites Alt-Right Group Proud Boys to Dallas Show|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/trapt_frontman_chris_taylor_brown_invites_alt-right_group_proud_boys_to_dallas_show|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-19|website=[[Exclaim!]]|language=en-ca}}</ref>
