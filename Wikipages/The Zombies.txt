'''The Zombies''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in the early 1960s in [[St Albans]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-mn0000582313/biography|title=The Zombies Biography, Songs, & Albums|website=AllMusic}}</ref> and led by keyboardist and vocalist [[Rod Argent]] and vocalist [[Colin Blunstone]]. The group had a British and American [[chart-topper|hit]] in 1964 with "[[She's Not There]]". In the US, two further singles—"[[Tell Her No]]" in 1965 and "[[Time of the Season]]" in 1968—were also successful.<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|first=Richie |last=Unterberger|author-link=Richie Unterberger |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-zombies-mn0000582313/biography |title=The Zombies &#124; Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref> Their 1968 album ''[[Odessey and Oracle]]'' is ranked number 100 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/the-zombies-odessey-and-oracle-20120525 |title=The Zombies, 'Odessey and Oracle' - 500 Greatest Albums of All Time |work=Rolling Stone |date=31 May 2012 |access-date=2015-12-05}}</ref> The Zombies were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=CLASS OF 2019 INDUCTEES|url=https://www.rockhall.com/2019-inductees/|website=Rock & Roll Hall of Fame|access-date=13 December 2018|language=en}}</ref>

==History==
===1961–1964===
[[File:Blacksmiths Arms St. Albans and Zombies' Plaque.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Blacksmiths Arms public house in [[St Albans]], Hertfordshire, where The Zombies first met]]Three members of the band, [[Rod Argent]], [[Paul Atkinson (guitarist)|Paul Atkinson]] and [[Hugh Grundy]], first came together to jam in 1961 in [[St Albans]], Hertfordshire. Argent wanted to form a band and initially asked his elder cousin [[Jim Rodford]] to join as a bassist. Rodford was in a successful local band, the Bluetones, at the time and so declined, but he offered to help Argent (Rodford would later join in 2004 when the band reformed). [[Colin Blunstone]] and Paul Arnold joined the other three to form the band in April 1962, while all five members were at school.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oldies.about.com/od/britishinvasion/p/zombies.htm|title=British Invasion's Darker Side: The Zombies|author=Fontenot, Robert|website=Oldies.about.com|access-date=11 December 2015}} {{dead link|date=September 2021}}</ref>

Some sources state that Argent, Atkinson, and Grundy were at [[St Albans School (Hertfordshire)|St Albans School]], while Blunstone and Arnold were students at St Albans Boys' Grammar School (since renamed [[Verulam School]]). However, both Blunstone and Grundy came from [[Hatfield, Hertfordshire|Hatfield]] and both sang in the choir there at [[St Etheldreda's Church, Hatfield|St Etheldreda's Church]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Bateman |first=Aarom |url=http://www.hendontimes.co.uk/archive/display.var.434582.0.zombies_heyday_recalled.php |title=Zombies' heyday recalled |work=Hendon & Finchley Times |date=20 November 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070503053115/http://www.hendontimes.co.uk/archive/display.var.434582.0.zombies_heyday_recalled.php |archive-date=3 May 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicbands.com/zombies.html |title=The Zombies |publisher=Classicbands.com |access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref> Argent was a boy chorister in [[St Albans Cathedral Choir]]. They held their original rehearsals at the Pioneer Club, then situated in Hatfield Road, using equipment lent to them by the Bluetones. They met outside the Blacksmiths Arms pub in St Albans before their first rehearsal and gained their initial reputation playing the Old Verulamians Rugby Club there.

Their original name was the Mustangs, but they quickly realised that there were other groups with that name. It was Arnold who came up with the Zombies, according to Blunstone.<ref>{{cite web |first=Jay |last=Cridlin |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/content/zombies-colin-blunstone-talks-touring-america-scoring-hits-60s-and-how-group-got-its-name |title=The Zombies' Colin Blunstone talks touring in America, scoring hits in the '60s and how the group got its name |work=[[Tampa Bay Times]] |date=27 July 2012 |access-date=2015-08-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924123735/http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/soundcheck/content/zombies-colin-blunstone-talks-touring-america-scoring-hits-60s-and-how-group-got-its-name |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When Argent was asked about the origins of the band's name in a 2015 interview with ''[[PopMatters]]'' journalist J.C. Maçek III, Argent said, "Well, we chose that name in 1961 and, I mean, I knew vaguely that they were: sort of, you know, the Walking Dead from [[Haiti]] and Colin didn't even really know what they were." Argent explains, "It was [original bass guitarist] Paul [Arnold] that came up with the name. I don't know where he got it from. He very soon left the band after that." However, Arnold also left his mark with the name. "I thought this was a name that no one else is going to have. And I just liked the whole idea of it. Colin was wary, I'm sure, at the beginning, I know, but I always, always really, really liked it."<ref name=PM>{{cite web|work=[[PopMatters]]|author=Maçek III, J.C.|title="There Are No Half-Measures" An Interview with the Zombies' Rod Argent|date=4 November 2015|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/there-are-no-half-measures-an-interview-with-the-zombies-rod-argent/}}</ref>

Arnold lost interest in the band and chose to leave to become a physician; he was replaced by [[Chris White (musician)|Chris White]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/zombies.html |title=The Zombies |publisher=Classicbands.com |access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref> After winning a beat-group competition sponsored by the London ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|Evening News]]'', they signed a recording contract with [[Decca Records|Decca]] and recorded their first hit, "[[She's Not There]]". It was released in mid-1964 and peaked at number 12 in the UK, becoming their only UK [[Top 40]] hit. The tune began to catch on in the United States and eventually climbed to number 2 in early December. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

===1965–1968===
[[File:Zombies1966.png|thumb|left|250px|The Zombies in 1966. L-R: Chris White, Colin Blunstone, Hugh Grundy,  Paul Atkinson and Rod Argent.]]Like many other British groups, the Zombies travelled to the United States to tour on the momentum of their hit single. Among their early US gigs were [[Murray the K]]'s Christmas shows at the [[Brooklyn]] Fox Theatre, where the band played seven performances a day. On 12 January 1965 the band made their first in-person appearance on US television on the first episode of NBC's ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]]'' and played "She's Not There" and their new single "[[Tell Her No]]" to a screaming, hysterical audience full of teenage girls.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In the UK, the Zombies' follow-up single to "She's Not There" was written by Chris White.  "[[Leave Me Be]]" was unsuccessful in the UK and as a result was not issued as an A-side in the US.  It did appear as the B side of their second US single, "Tell Her No". Penned by Rod Argent, "Tell Her No" became another big seller in 1965, peaking at No.6 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] Hot 100 in March. As the band's third UK single, "Tell Her No" failed to make the Top 40, peaking at number 42. Subsequent recordings such as "[[She's Coming Home]]", "[[Whenever You're Ready (The Zombies song)|Whenever You're Ready]]", "Is This the Dream", "Indication" and "Gotta Get a Hold of Myself" failed to achieve the success of the previous two singles (although the Zombies had continued success in Scandinavia and the Philippines, which led to a series of concerts in 1967).<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> A song by the Zombies released only as a B-side (to "Whenever You're Ready") in both the US and UK in 1965, "[[I Love You (The Zombies song)|I Love You]]" subsequently became a sizeable hit for the group [[People!]] in the United States in 1968.

The Zombies' first UK album, ''[[Begin Here]]'' (1965) was an interesting mixture of original songs and [[rhythm and blues]] [[cover version]]s. Of the eight original tracks, Rod Argent supplied the album's biggest hit, "She's Not There", and the songs "Woman", "I Remember When I Loved Her", plus "The Way I Feel Inside" which was the shortest track on the album at 1:28. It might have been shorter, had not their recording manager and producer Ken Jones added the sounds of footsteps and a coin dropping, which contributed to the feeling of alienation that the song projected. Bassist Chris White provided "I Can't Make Up My Mind", the quirky "I Don't Want to Know", plus the beaty "What More Can I Do" which, at 1:38, is the second-shortest cut on the album and contains a simple but distinctive drum riff.  The final original was an instrumental written by Ken Jones, "Work 'n' Play".

The Zombies continued recording original songs through 1965 and 1966, trying to achieve chart success.  There were enough tracks to have filled a follow-up album, but due to the band's lack of chart success, most of these tracks remained unissued at the time.<ref name=RIP>{{cite web |url=http://albumsthatneverwere.blogspot.com/2014/07/the-zombies-rip.html|title=The zombies - R.I.P.|website=Albumsthatneverwere.blogspot.com|access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref>

In 1967, frustrated by their continuing lack of success, the Zombies signed a recording contract with [[Columbia Records|CBS Records]] for whom they recorded the album ''[[Odessey and Oracle]]'' at EMI's world-famous Abbey Road studios. (''Odyssey'' was accidentally misspelled by Terry Quirk, an art teacher who designed the cover).<ref name="Russo">{{cite book |last=Russo |first=Greg |title=Time of the Season: The Zombies Collector Guide |date=12 August 2008 |isbn=9780979184505}}</ref> The band's budget did not stretch to session musicians, so they used a [[Mellotron]] to fill out their arrangements.  According to Argent,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|date=2019-06-01|title=Five Things We Learned About the Zombies|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/zombies-band-interview-podcast-842990/|access-date=2021-08-03|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-02-29|title=Rod Argent, The Zombies and John Lennon's mellotron: interview|url=https://the-shortlisted.co.uk/rod-argent-the-zombies-interview/|access-date=2021-08-03|website=The Shortlisted|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Umile|first=Dominic|title=Mods and Mellotrons: The Zombies at Abbey Road, PopMatters|url=https://www.popmatters.com/166784-mods-and-mellotrons-the-zombies-at-abbey-road-2495787881.html|access-date=2021-08-03|website=PopMatters|language=en-US}}</ref> they used [[John Lennon|John Lennon's]] [[Mellotron]], which had been left in the studio after [[the Beatles]]' sessions for ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''. The album was mixed into the standard mono; however as another concession toward their limited budget, Argent and White (who, due to their songwriting royalties, had earned more than the rest of the members) personally paid for stereo mixes.<ref name="Russo" />

The change in direction was evident on their first single released by CBS, "[[Care of Cell 44]]", a song about the anticipation felt while waiting for the singer's partner to be released from prison.  It is also notable for the title of the song not appearing anywhere in the lyrics.  Unfortunately, like their previous Decca releases, it failed to reach the charts. A second CBS single, "Friends of Mine", was also unsuccessful.  With the band experiencing a declining demand for live appearances, they split up after a final gig in mid-December 1967.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yTCSX933VcC&pg=PA201 |page=201 |title=The Zombies: hung up on a dream : a biography 1962–1967 |first=Claes |last=Johansen |publisher=SAF Publishing Ltd |date=1 September 2001 |isbn=9780946719341 |access-date=28 March 2012}}</ref>  ''Odessey and Oracle'', the band's swansong, was released in April 1968 and sold poorly. It was only given a US release because musician [[Al Kooper]], then signed to Columbia Records, convinced his label of the album's merits. One of its tracks, "[[Time of the Season]]", written by Argent, was released as a single in 1968 and spent a long period as a 'sleeper'. Eventually, in 1969, it grew to become a nationwide hit in the US, peaking in the Hot 100 ([[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] at No.3).

In 1968, Argent and White began working on material for a possible new band when they were approached by CBS to do another Zombies album. Several new tracks were cut with a line-up of Argent, Hugh Grundy, Rodford (bass) and Rick Birkett (guitar), and were combined with some old Decca out-takes and demos that were overdubbed and enhanced in sessions at Morgan Studios in London. The album, scheduled for release in 1969, was cancelled and only a couple of the songs, "Imagine the Swan" (one of the newly recorded songs) and "If It Don't Work Out" (a demo of a song that [[Dusty Springfield]] recorded and released in 1965), were put out as singles instead. (Some of this material was released on various compilation albums during the 1970s and 1980s, and the album, titled ''[[R.I.P. (The Zombies album)|R.I.P.]]'', was finally released in Japan in 2000).<ref name=RIP />

=== Post–Zombies (1969–1988) ===
The original line-up declined to regroup for concerts following the belated American success of "Time of the Season". In turn, various concocted bands tried to capitalize on the success and falsely toured under the band's name. In a scheme organized by Delta Promotions, an agency that also created fake touring versions of [[The Animals]] and [[The Archies]], two fake Zombie line-ups were touring simultaneously in 1969, one hailing from Texas, the other from Michigan.<ref name="Buzzfeed">{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/danielralston/the-true-story-of-the-fake-zombies-the-strangest-con-in-rock?bftw |title=The True Story of the Fake Zombies, The Strangest Con in Rock History |publisher=BuzzFeed |access-date=2016-06-04}}</ref> The Texas group featured bassist [[Dusty Hill]] and drummer [[Frank Beard (musician)|Frank Beard]], soon to be members of [[ZZ Top]].<ref name="Buzzfeed" /> Another group toured in 1988, going so far as to not only trademark the group's name (the real band had let it lapse) but also recruit a bass guitarist named Ronald Hugh Grundy, claiming that original drummer Hugh Grundy had switched instruments.<ref name="Powers">{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/zombies-biography |title=What did The Zombies contribute to music? - Homework Help |publisher=eNotes.com |access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref>

In 1969, Rod Argent formed the band called [[Argent (band)|Argent]] with White as a non-performing songwriter. Atkinson worked in A&R at [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] and Grundy joined him there after a brief spell in auto sales. Blunstone started a solo career after a brief period outside the music business, including working in the burglary claims section of the [[Sun Alliance (company)|Sun Alliance]] insurance company. Both Argent and White provided him with new songs. He also did studio vocals for [[the Alan Parsons Project]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Atkinson retired as a performer and worked as an [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] executive for many years.<ref name="obit" />

===1989–1999===
In 1989, Blunstone, White and Grundy briefly reunited as the Zombies with guitarist/keyboardist [[Sebastian Santa Maria]] and recorded the album ''The Return of the Zombies'' (February 1990), featuring some tracks that were remixed or re-recorded that appeared alongside some new songs the following year on ''[[New World (The Zombies album)|New World]]'' (April 1991).<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

A 1997, 120-track compilation of the original band's work, ''[[Zombie Heaven]]'', was released on UK Ace/Big beat.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> The compilation contains all the band's Decca/Parrot recordings (in mono), the entire ''Odessey And Oracle'' LP (in stereo), the material that would have made up the unissued ''R.I.P.'' LP, several unissued recordings and a disc of recordings made for the BBC. On 25 November 1997, all five Zombies reunited at [[the Jazz Café]] in London's [[Camden Town]] as part of a solo show by Blunstone to perform "She's Not There" and "Time of the Season" to promote the release of ''Zombie Heaven''.

Blunstone and Argent did not play together again until late 1999. Argent spotted Blunstone in the audience while performing at a charity concert for jazz musician [[John Dankworth]] and invited him onstage for an impromptu reunion. This positive experience set the stage for further collaborations to come.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/they-came-from-the-60s-the-zombie-invasion-continues-6495482|title=THEY CAME FROM THE '60S!

[[File:The Zombies 2019.jpg|thumb|The Zombies performing Odessey and Oracle during the "Something Great From ’68’" tour in September 2019]]

===2000–present===
The twosome reunited to play shows together in 2000 under the Colin Blunstone & Rod Argent moniker and moved to the U.S. in 2001. They recorded an album, ''Out of the Shadows'' (2001), and continued playing live shows together into 2004 when they began going out under the name "The Zombies" again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chicagoinnerview.com/innerviews/rod-argent-colin-blunstone|title=Rod Argent, Colin Blunstone|author=Piniak, Jeremy|access-date=11 December 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121052942/http://chicagoinnerview.com/innerviews/rod-argent-colin-blunstone/|archive-date=21 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The new line-up included Keith Airey (brother of [[Don Airey]]) on guitar, [[Jim Rodford]] on bass, and his son Steve Rodford on drums.

In 2002, Ace/Big Beat released the 48-track ''The Decca Stereo Anthology'', which, for the first time, mixed all the Decca/Parrot recordings into true stereo. An album of new material released in 2004, ''[[As Far as I Can See...]]'', received poor-to-scathing reviews from both [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] and [[AllMusic]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

In January 2004, guitarist Paul Atkinson received the President's Merit Award from the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences at a benefit concert at the House of Blues in Los Angeles, California. The Zombies reunited for the event, which turned out to be Atkinson's last performance with them.<ref name=obit>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/apr/05/local/me-passings5.6|title=Paul Atkinson, 58; Zombies Guitarist Became Industry Exec|date=5 April 2004|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|access-date=11 December 2015}}</ref> He died later that year on 1 April 2004, in [[Santa Monica, California]], from liver and kidney disease.

In 2005, Blunstone and Argent released a DVD and 2-CD album (''Live at the Bloomsbury Theatre'') and continued touring with the Zombies. To mark the 40th anniversary of ''Odessey and Oracle'', the four surviving original members of the Zombies participated in a three-night series of concerts at London's [[Shepherd's Bush]] Empire Theatre between 7 and 9 March 2008.<ref>{{cite web
