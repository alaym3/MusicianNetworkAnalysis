The '''Taizé Community''' is an [[ecumenical]] [[Christianity|Christian]] [[monasticism|monastic]] [[fraternity]] in [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire|Taizé]], [[Saône-et-Loire]], [[Burgundy]], France. It is composed of more than one hundred brothers, from [[Catholicism|Catholic]] and [[Protestantism|Protestant]] traditions, who originate from about thirty countries across the world. It was founded in 1940 by [[Brother Roger|Brother Roger Schütz]], a [[Reformed Christianity|Reformed]] [[Protestant]]. Guidelines for the community’s life are contained in ''The Rule of Taizé'' written by Brother Roger and first published in French in 1954.<ref name="TZTheRule">{{cite web |url=http://www.spckpublishing.co.uk/product/the-rule-of-taize/ |title=The Rule of Taizé &#124; Brother Roger &#124; 9780281068272 &#124; Publishing Christian Books |publisher=Spckpublishing.co.uk |date=2005-08-16 |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108210751/http://spckpublishing.co.uk/product/the-rule-of-taize/ |archive-date=2016-01-08 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Taizé has become one of the world's most important sites of Christian [[pilgrimage]], with a focus on youth. Over 100,000 young people from around the world make pilgrimages to Taizé each year for prayer, [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]], sharing, and communal work. Through the community's ecumenical outlook, they are encouraged to live in the spirit of kindness, simplicity and reconciliation. The community's church, the '''Church of Reconciliation''', was inaugurated on 6 August 1962. It was designed by a Taizé member and architect, Brother Denis. Young Germans from [[Action Reconciliation Service for Peace]], created for reconciliation after [[World War II]], assumed the work of building it. Owing to the founder's commitment, since its inception the community has evolved into an important site for [[Catholic–Lutheran dialogue|Catholic–Lutheran ecumenism]]. A Catholic, [[Brother Alois]], succeeded as [[prior]] after his predecessor's death in 2005.

{{More citations needed section|date=June 2021}}
===Early years===
[[File:Brother Roger at prayer.jpg|thumb|right|Brother Roger, founder of the Taizé Community, shown at prayer in 2003]]
The Taizé Community was founded by [[Brother Roger]] (Roger Schütz) in 1940.<ref>{{Cite news | title = Obituary: Brother Roger Schutz | author = Alain Woodrow | url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/19/guardianobituaries.religion | newspaper = [[The Guardian]] | location = London | date = 19 August 2005 | access-date = 16 December 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160919062800/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/aug/19/guardianobituaries.religion | archive-date = 19 September 2016 | url-status = live }}</ref> He pondered what it really meant to live a life according to the [[Scriptures]] and began a quest for a different expression of the Christian life. A year after this decision, Schütz reflected:

{{quote|The defeat of France awoke powerful sympathy. If a house could be found there, of the kind I had dreamed of, it would offer a possible way of assisting some of those most discouraged, those deprived of a livelihood; and it could become a place of silence and work.{{sfn|González-Balado|1981|p=31}}}}

Because his native [[Switzerland]] was neutral and thus less affected by the war, Schütz felt as if France would be ideal for his vision, seeing it as a "land of poverty, a land of wartime suffering, but a land of inner freedom."{{sfn|González-Balado|1981|p=32}} He eventually settled in [[Taizé, Saône-et-Loire|Taizé]], which was a small, isolated village just north of [[Cluny]], the site of a historically influential Christian monastic foundation.

In September 1940, Schütz purchased a small house that would eventually become the home of the Taizé Community. Only miles south of the demarcation line that separated [[Vichy France]] and the ''[[Zone occupée]]'', Brother Roger’s home became a sanctuary to countless war [[refugee]]s seeking shelter. On November 11, 1942, the [[Gestapo]] occupied Roger’s house while he was in Switzerland collecting funds to aid in his refuge ministry. Roger was not able to return to his home in Taizé until the autumn of 1944, when France was liberated.{{sfn|González-Balado|1981|pp=39–40}}

In 1941, Brother Roger had published a few small [[brochure]]s outlining several facets of a Christ-centred communal life together. These brochures prompted two young men to apply, soon followed by a third. They all lived in Switzerland in a flat owned by Roger’s family until after the war when they began a new life together in the French countryside. Over the next few years several other men would join the community. On [[Easter Sunday]] 1949, seven brothers committed themselves<ref name="TZTheBeginnings">{{cite web |url=http://www.taize.fr/en_article6526.html |title=The Beginnings - Taizé |publisher=Taize.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905160605/http://www.taize.fr/en_article6526.html |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> to a life following Christ in simplicity, celibacy and community.<ref name="TZLifeCommitment">{{cite web |url=http://www.taize.fr/en_article6.html |title=A lifelong commitment - Taizé |publisher=Taize.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905191127/http://www.taize.fr/en_article6.html |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Growth and current situation===
In the years that followed, others joined. In 1969, a young Belgian doctor became the first Catholic to pledge his life to the Taizé Community. More brothers from Reformed, Anglican and Catholic backgrounds joined the community. Soon the Brothers of Taizé were making trips to take aid to people in both rural and urban areas.<ref name="TZbrothersoftaize">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826571,00.html "The Brothers of Taizé"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203140345/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,826571,00.html |date=2009-12-03 }}, ''TIME'' Magazine, September 5, 1960</ref> They began forming “fraternities” of brothers in other cities that sought to be “signs of the presence of Christ among men, and bearers of joy”. Since 1951, the brothers have lived, for longer or shorter periods, in small fraternities among the poor in [[India]] (chiefly in [[Calcutta]]), [[Bangladesh]], the [[Philippines]], [[Algeria]], [[Brazil]], [[Kenya]], [[Senegal]], and the [[United States]] (chiefly in the [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell’s Kitchen]] section of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]]).

In August 2005 Brother Roger, aged 90, was killed in a knife attack by a mentally-ill woman.<ref>[[Wikinews:Taizé ecumenical community founder Frère Roger assassinated|Taizé ecumenical community founder Frère Roger assassinated]], [[Wikinews]]</ref>  At his funeral, Brother Roger had an ecumenical dream fulfilled. The presider at his funeral was the president of the Vatican's council for the unity of Christians, Cardinal [[Walter Kasper]]. Anglican bishop [[Nigel McCulloch]] of [[Anglican Diocese of Manchester|Manchester, England]], who represented [[Rowan Williams]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], read the first reading in English. The second reading was read in French by the Rev. [[Jean-Arnold de Clermont]], president of the Conference of European Churches, and in German by Bishop [[Wolfgang Huber]], head of the Evangelical Church in Germany. Cardinals and archbishops, Orthodox, Anglican and other religious leaders and international politicians joined ordinary Christians in prayer during the funeral, including the President of Germany, [[Horst Köhler]], and the retired Archbishop of Paris, [[Jean-Marie Lustiger]]. His funeral was attended by approximately 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tagliabue|first=John|title=At His Funeral, Brother Roger Has an Ecumenical Dream Fulfilled|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/international/europe/24france.html|work=The New York Times|access-date=12 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329164515/http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/24/international/europe/24france.html|archive-date=29 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Peter|title=Some 10,000 Christians gather in Taize for funeral of Brother Roger|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0504820.htm|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050824165212/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0504820.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 August 2005|publisher=Catholic News Service|access-date=12 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2010, for the celebration of the 70th anniversary of Taizé, five years after Brother Roger's death, ecumenical messages of love and benediction were received from church leaders as varied as: 
* [[Pope Benedict XVI]] 
* [[Patriarch Bartholomew of Constantinople]] 
* [[Patriarch Kirill of Moscow]] 
* The [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]] 
* The General Secretary of the [[Lutheran World Federation]], [[Ishmael Noko]]

===Engagement with youth culture===
In the 1960s young people began to visit the Taizé community. The first international young adults' meeting was organized in Taizé in 1966 with participants from 110 countries.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The village church of Taizé, which had been used for the community's prayers, became too small to accommodate the pilgrims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} A new church, the Church of Reconciliation, was built in the early 1960s with the help of volunteers from the German [[Action Reconciliation Service for Peace]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.taize.fr/de_article14234.html|title = Die Versöhnungskirche wurde vor fünfzig Jahren eingeweiht - Taizé}}</ref> and expanded several times in the subsequent decades – first with tents, and then with simple wooden annexes.

In 1970, in response to student protests taking place all over Europe and around the world, as well as the [[Second Vatican Council]], Brother Roger announced a "Council of Youth",<ref name="TZCouncilOfYouth">{{cite web |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911252,00.html |title=Religion: The Pilgrims of Taiz |publisher=TIME |date=1974-04-29 |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813204750/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,911252,00.html |archive-date=2013-08-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref> whose main meeting took place in 1974.

At the end of the 1970s, the meetings and surrounding activities began to be referred to by the Brothers as a "Pilgrimage of Trust on Earth". The community decided to focus on youth.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==={{anchor|Taize service}} Music and worship===
[[file:Kirche der Versöhnung panorama 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Prayer in the Church of Reconciliation at Taizé]]
The community, though Western European in origin, has sought to include people and traditions worldwide. They have sought to demonstrate this in the music and prayers where songs are sung in many languages, and have included [[chants]] and [[icons]] from the [[Eastern Orthodox]] tradition. The music emphasizes simple phrases, usually lines from [[Psalms]] or other pieces of [[Scripture]], repeated and sometimes also sung in [[Canon (music)|canon]].<ref name="TZMusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.taize.fr/en_rubrique12.html |title=At the Wellspring of Faith - Taizé |publisher=Taize.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905150514/http://www.taize.fr/en_rubrique12.html |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Earlier Taizé community music was conceived and composed by [[Jacques Berthier]].<ref name="denver">{{cite web | url=http://www.calvarydenver.org/taize/ | title=Taize Worship | access-date=2009-03-21 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090411151733/http://www.calvarydenver.org/taize/ | archive-date=2009-04-11 }}</ref> Later [[Joseph Gelineau]] became a major contributor to the music.<ref name="denver"/>

Ecumenical services based on this model and music are held in many churches throughout the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.taize.fr/en_rubrique10.html |title=Around the World - Taizé |publisher=Taize.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905161721/http://www.taize.fr/en_rubrique10.html |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Young adult meetings==
{{More citations needed section|date=June 2021}}
===In Taizé===
[[Image:TaizeSmallGroups.jpg|thumb|right|Small discussion groups]]
Throughout the year, meetings for young adults between 17 and 30 years old (and, within certain limits, for adults and families with children) take place in Taizé. The number of visitors reaches more than 5,000 during the summer and on Easter.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Meetings usually last from Sunday to Sunday, though it is also possible to just come for a few days, or, for young volunteers, to stay for a longer time.

Several sisters also help with running the meetings. However, they are not "Taizé Sisters". These sisters come from various orders, most notably the Catholic order of St. Andrew from Belgium. The Sisters of St. Andrew live in the neighboring village [[Ameugny]].

The Taizé Community attempts to send pilgrims back from youth meetings to their local churches, to their parishes, groups or communities, to undertake, with many others, a “Pilgrimage of Trust on Earth.”<ref name="TZpilgrimage">{{cite web |url=http://www.taize.fr/en_article58.html |title=A pilgrimage of trust on earth - Taizé |publisher=Taize.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905153542/http://www.taize.fr/en_article58.html |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> Every year around New Year (usually from 28 December to 1 January), a meeting in a large European city attracts several tens of thousands of young adults.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lalsace.fr/actualite/2013/12/28/20-000-jeunes-chretien-arrivent-en-alsace-pour-sa-rencontre-de-taize-commence-a-strasbourg-avec |title=Fil Info &#124; Taizé : 30 000 jeunes chrétiens rassemblés en Alsace |publisher=Lalsace.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108210748/http://www.lalsace.fr/actualite/2013/12/28/20-000-jeunes-chretien-arrivent-en-alsace-pour-sa-rencontre-de-taize-commence-a-strasbourg-avec |archive-date=2016-01-08 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.news.va/en/news/taize-in-berlin-learn-to-trust-in-christ |title=Taize in Berlin: learn to trust in Christ |publisher=News.va |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160108210747/http://www.news.va/en/news/taize-in-berlin-learn-to-trust-in-christ |archive-date=2016-01-08 |url-status=live }}</ref> It is organized by brothers of the Taizé Community, sisters of St. Andrew, and young volunteers from all over Europe, and from the host city. The participants stay with local families or in very simple group accommodations. In the morning, they take part in a program organized by the parish closest to their accommodation. For their midday meal, all participants travel to a central location, usually the local exhibition halls. The meal is followed by a common prayer, and the afternoon is spent in workshops covering faith, art, politics and social topics. In the evening, everyone meets again for the evening meal and an evening prayer.

In his "Unfinished Letter",<ref name="TZUnfinished">{{cite web |url=http://www.taize.fr/en_article2964.html |title=Brother Roger's unfinished letter - Taizé |publisher=Taize.fr |access-date=2015-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905225608/http://www.taize.fr/en_article2964.html |archive-date=2015-09-05 |url-status=live }}</ref> published after his death, Brother Roger is quoted to have proposed to "widen" the "Pilgrimage of Trust" originating from the Taizé community. As a result, international meetings for young adults have begun to take place, beginning with [[Kolkata]] in [[India]] in 2006. The program closely resembles the European meetings, though some aspects, such as the songs, are often adapted to the local culture.
