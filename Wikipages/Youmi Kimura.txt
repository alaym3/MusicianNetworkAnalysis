{{Nihongo|'''Youmi Kimura'''|木村 弓|Kimura Yumi}} is a Japanese singer and [[lyre]] performer. She was born in [[Osaka Prefecture]], Japan, and became famous in 2001 for her song "Itsumo nando demo" (いつも何度でも, "Always With Me"), which served as the closing theme to the popular 2001 anime film ''[[Spirited Away]]'' by [[Hayao Miyazaki]].

Kimura and Miyazaki had great admiration for each other's works{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}. She was so moved by his 1997 film ''[[Princess Mononoke]]'' (もののけ姫, ''Mononoke hime''), that she wrote a letter to him, enclosed with a copy of her album. Miyazaki wrote her back and mentioned to her about a film he was currently working on called ''Rin the Chimney Cleaner'' (煙突描きのリン ''Entotsu-kaki no Rin''). Hoping Miyazaki would use her material on this film, Kimura, with her lyricist Wakako Kaku (覚 和歌子), wrote a new song called "Itsumo nando demo" (いつも何度でも, "Always With Me"). Miyazaki did like the song, and intended to use it, but the ''Rin'' project was eventually scrapped.<ref name="nausicaa1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nausicaa.net/miyazaki/sen/song.html|title = Yumi KIMURA // Spirited Away // Nausicaa.net}}</ref>

Later, Miyazaki started working on his next film ''Spirited Away'', and listened to the song again. Throughout the entire production, he would listen to it obsessively.<ref name="nausicaa1"/> He would later realize that Kimura's song about finding [[inner peace]] meshed perfectly with his [[coming of age]] story of a girl who finds her inner strength.

Kimura worked with Miyazaki on ''[[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|Howl's Moving Castle]]'', writing a song for it. (ハウルの動く城, ''Sekai no yakusoku'').
