==Early life==
Brandon Paak Anderson was born on February 8, 1986, at [[St. John's Regional Medical Center (California)|St John's Regional Medical Center]] in [[Oxnard, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vcstar.com/story/news/2018/11/18/dr-dre-celebrates-anderson-paak-album-oxnard/1992294002/|title = Dr. Dre arrives to celebrate new Anderson .Paak album titled 'Oxnard'}}</ref> He is of mixed African American and Korean heritage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kindaneat.net/anderson-paak/|title=Episode 54: Anderson Paak|website=Kindaneat.net|date=April 2, 2014|access-date=January 18, 2020}}</ref> Anderson's mother was born in [[South Korea]] during the [[Korean War]] to a Korean woman who was a farmer and an African American soldier. She was initially raised by her Korean grandparents, before being placed in an orphanage and then later adopted by an American family who lived in [[Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Episode 991 - Anderson .Paak|publisher=WTF with Marc Maron|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episode-991-anderson-paak |access-date=May 11, 2019}}</ref>

At the age of seven,  Anderson witnessed his estranged father attack his mother: "My little sister and I went out front and my pops was on top of my mom. There was blood in the street. He was arrested and that was the last time I saw him. I think he did fourteen years."

Shortly after he started his senior year of high school, his mother was criminally convicted of major fraud. "I got a call in class: 'They arrested your mom today.'" Anderson's mother pleaded guilty to defrauding investors of millions using her produce distribution company. She received a seven-year prison sentence.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anderson Paak: Dr. Dre's Golden Child Goes From Protege to Solo Star|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/magazine-feature/6842874/anderson-paak-on-malibu-album-working-with-dr-dre-life-struggles|work=Billboard|first=Chris|last=Martins|date=January 14, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
===2009–2013: Career beginnings===
Anderson began producing music from his bedroom as a teenager, while attending [[Foothill Technology High School]]. His first experiences performing were as a drummer at his family's church.<ref name=":1">{{Citation|last=Breakfast Club Power 105.1 FM|title=Anderson Paak Interview With The Breakfast Club (7-28-16)|date=July 28, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHkdOsycCA8| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/ZHkdOsycCA8| archive-date=November 7, 2021 | url-status=live|access-date=February 7, 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2011, prior to being a successful working musician, Anderson became homeless with his wife and infant son after he was dismissed from his job at a marijuana farm in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]].<ref name="LAWcurious">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/randb-singer-anderson-paak-has-a-curious-new-project-4169754|title=R&B singer Anderson Paak has a curious new project|publisher=LA Weekly|first=Jeff|last=Weiss|date=November 27, 2013}}</ref> Early in his career, Anderson used the stage name Breezy Lovejoy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Anderson .Paak Sings Hot Sauce Ballads While Eating Spicy Wings {{!}} Hot Ones|website = [[YouTube]]|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eot4ZOUUNRI|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2011, Anderson had started earning acceptance in the [[Los Angeles]] music world as he worked on his debut album. Shafiq Husayn of [[Sa-Ra]] and Los Angeles based rapper [[Dumbfoundead]] helped Anderson recover financially from losing his job in Santa Barbara by employing him as an assistant, videographer, editor, writer and producer. He completed ''O.B.E. Vol.1'' and released the album on June 30, 2012. He became the drummer for former ''[[American Idol]]'' semi-finalist [[Haley Reinhart]].<ref name=LAWcurious/> After the release of ''O.B.E. Vol.1'', Anderson changed his stage name to Anderson .Paak.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

On November 27, 2013, Paak produced and recorded ''Cover Art'', an all-covers EP. Paak was inspired by the white artists of the 1950s who achieved commercial success by remaking songs written by Black blues and R&B singers, while hardly ever compensating the original artists.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sound of Tomorrow with Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals (LIVE)|url=http://www.theecho.com/event/797369-sound-tomorrow-anderson-los-angeles/|website=theecho.com|access-date=January 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131112121/http://www.theecho.com/event/797369-sound-tomorrow-anderson-los-angeles/|archive-date=January 31, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Cover Art'' reversed the process and transformed folk and rock classics from white musicians into a mold of soul, funk, jazz, left-field pop, hip-hop, and R&B.
