{{blockquote|"''777'' was a stage in my life and it has taken a long time to do this album but this name, ''2Sides'', is more poignant to where I think I am now in my life and what I think the album exudes - the light and the dark side of who I am - the album exemplifies that in both ways.

"People have never seen the urban side of what I do as well so they’ll get to see that side for the first time. It's an album that has so many different faces so ''2Sides'' was the more appropriate title."<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/isle-of-mtv/news/jason-derulo-spills-deets-on-that-rumoured-bts-collab|title=Jason Derulo Spills Deets on That Rumoured BTS Collab|website=[[MTV]]|date=June 28, 2018|access-date=July 20, 2019}}</ref>}}

==Artistry==
Derulo's music is generally [[Pop music|pop]], but also incorporates [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] influences. He has predominantly named [[Michael Jackson]] as his inspiration. Derulo states "He is the reason I am who I am today. When I was 4 years old, I saw him for the first time. I saw how he moved the crowd and how people were just so touched".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Jason Derulo Channels Michael Jackson in Musical Tribute|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tv/jason-derulo-channels-michael-jackson-in-musical-070831398.html|website=[[Yahoo!]]|access-date=July 3, 2016}}</ref> His other musical influences include [[Elvis Presley]], [[Madonna]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] and [[Justin Timberlake]].<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.mtv.com:80/artists/jason-derulo/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy |title=Influences for Jason Derulo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929030512/http://www.mtv.com/artists/jason-derulo/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy |website=[[MTV]] |archive-date=September 29, 2015 |access-date=October 28, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Jason Lipshutz speaks on his overall music and sound stating he operates "in two musical modes", describing one as "positive PG-romance [[dance-pop]] personality", and the other as a "bumping, faux-crass club thumpers".

==Controversies==

In December 2019, a photo posted by Derulo on [[Instagram]] went viral, as it showed the singer wearing a pair of trunks, with a visible outline of his penis. The post was removed from Instagram for violating the platform's "Community Guidelines on nudity and sexual activity".<ref>{{cite news|last=Makalintal|first=Bettina|title=A Brief, Highly TMI History of Jason Derulo's Penis|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/4aggkm/a-brief-highly-tmi-history-of-jason-derulos-penis|access-date=June 20, 2020|work=Vice|date=December 17, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Barbour|first=Shannon|title=Jason Derulo Is Pissed After Instagram Deleted His Anaconda-Size D*ck|url=https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a29891075/jason-derulo-penis-instagram-picture-cats-musical-movie/|access-date=June 20, 2020|work=Cosmopolitan|date=December 4, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Gillespie|first=Katherine|title=Jason Derulo's bulge tragically removed from Instagram|url=https://www.papermag.com/jason-derulo-pic-removed-instagram-2641516288.html?rebelltitem=9#rebelltitem9|access-date=June 20, 2020|work=Paper|date=December 4, 2019}}</ref>

In June 2020, Derulo sparked controversy after he released a song titled "Savage Love", without properly clearing and attributing a prominent sample in the song to New Zealand music producer [[Jawsh 685]]. The clearance issue was resolved and the song, which went viral on [[TikTok]], was eventually re-released as "[[Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)]]", credited to both artists.
