==Background==
Josh Ballard, Dan Ballard, Chris Foley, and Justin Turley self-produced and released several EPs and played many shows in the Hollywood area, under the name Juune. To get the attention of major labels, they hopped "the fence at [[Capitol Records]] and put flyers on cars" said Josh Ballard.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} They set a deadline of being signed by June 2005 or they would break up.

In the spring of 2004, drummer Turley left the band to move closer to his family in [[Texas]], and he was replaced by Jamie Pitts. The band continued to self-produce and release EPs and label interest began growing in late 2004.

In the spring of 2005, as the band was in the early stages of negotiating with several labels, Foley left the band to get married, and Pitts left to continue pursuing his academic goals. Daniel Dempsey joined the band shortly thereafter.

In August 2005, the band signed with [[Flicker Records]] of the [[Sony BMG]]'s [[Provident Label Group]]. Due to legal concerns, the name Juune was changed to Until June after their original deadline.

Their self-titled debut extended play, ''Until June – The EP'', featuring Josh Ballard on keyboards and vocals, Dan Ballard on guitar, Dempsey on drums, and Foley on bass, was released in March 2006.

Their debut [[studio album]], ''[[Until June (album)|Until June]]'', was produced by Brian Garcia and was released on April 17, 2007.

The band's first international success was in Greece when the single, "Sleepless", topped the radio charts on May 8, 2008.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In late 2008, the band left Flicker to sign with Authentik Artists.

The band was planning on releasing their second album in 2010, which might be entitled ''www''. Mixing of the album was reportedly completed March 27, 2010. However, the band posted a status update on May 11, 2010, noting "Re-doing a few guitar tracks for www It's sounding quite lovely." Mariah McManus sings backing vocals on one of the songs. On May 19, 2010, the band gave an album update, stating "It's official now. Finally after two years the second full length UJ record is done.". As of June 15, 2010, the album was "coming soon".<ref>June 19, 2010. [http://www.facebook.com/untiljune].  Until June (via [[Facebook]]).

The band's album, ''Young and Foolish'', was released August 21, 2012. The trio produced the album themselves, but brought in [[Grammy Award]]-winning mixer [[Kevin Killen]], to help achieve the "atmospheric blend".<ref>July 11, 2012. {{cite web |url=http://www.finance.yahoo.com/news/until-june-release-long-awaited-140500994.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120715055822/http://finance.yahoo.com/news/until-june-release-long-awaited-140500994.html |archive-date=July 15, 2012 |df=mdy }}.
