'''Miles Dewey Davis III''' (May 26, 1926{{spaced ndash}}September 28, 1991) was an American [[Trumpet|trumpeter]], bandleader, and composer. He is among the most influential and acclaimed figures in the [[history of jazz]] and [[20th century music|20th-century music]]. Davis adopted a variety of musical directions in a five-decade career that kept him at the forefront of many major stylistic developments in jazz.<ref name="allmusic"/>

Born in [[Alton, Illinois]], and raised in [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]], Davis left to study at [[Juilliard School|Juilliard]] in [[New York City]], before dropping out and making his professional debut as a member of [[saxophone|saxophonist]] [[Charlie Parker]]'s [[bebop]] quintet from 1944 to 1948. Shortly after, he recorded the ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' sessions for [[Capitol Records]], which were instrumental to the development of [[cool jazz]]. In the early 1950s, Miles Davis recorded some of the earliest [[hard bop]] music while on [[Prestige Records]] but did so haphazardly due to a heroin addiction. After a widely acclaimed comeback performance at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], he signed a long-term contract with [[Columbia Records]] and recorded the album ''[['Round About Midnight]]'' in 1955.{{sfn|Yanow|2005|p=176}} It was his first work with saxophonist [[John Coltrane]] and bassist [[Paul Chambers]], key members of the sextet he led into the early 1960s. During this period, he alternated between orchestral jazz collaborations with arranger [[Gil Evans]], such as the Spanish music-influenced ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960), and band recordings, such as ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'' (1958) and ''[[Kind of Blue]]'' (1959).<ref name="aar"/> The latter recording remains one of the most popular jazz albums of all time,{{sfn|McCurdy|2004|p=61}} having sold over five million copies in the U.S.

Davis made several line-up changes while recording ''[[Someday My Prince Will Come (Miles Davis album)|Someday My Prince Will Come]]'' (1961), his [[In Person Friday and Saturday Nights at the Blackhawk, Complete|1961 Blackhawk concerts]], and ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963), another mainstream success that introduced bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Herbie Hancock]], and drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]].<ref name="aar"/> After adding saxophonist [[Wayne Shorter]] to his new quintet in 1964,<ref name="aar">{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|title=Miles Davis, innovative, influential, and respected jazz legend|publisher=African American Registry|access-date=June 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809095005/http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/miles-davis-innovative-influential-and-respected-jazz-legend|archive-date=August 9, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Davis led them on a series of more abstract recordings often composed by the band members, helping pioneer the [[post-bop]] genre with albums such as ''[[E.S.P.

During the 1970s, he experimented with rock, funk, [[Rhythm in Sub-Saharan Africa|African rhythms]], emerging [[Music technology (electronic and digital)|electronic music technology]], and an ever-changing line-up of musicians, including keyboardist [[Joe Zawinul]], drummer [[Al Foster]], and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]].{{sfn|Freeman|2005|pp=9–11, 155–156}} This period, beginning with Davis's 1969 studio album ''[[In a Silent Way]]'' and concluding with the 1975 concert recording ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'', was the most controversial in his career, alienating and challenging many in jazz.<ref>{{harvnb|Christgau|1997}}; {{harvnb|Freeman|2005|pp=10–11, back cover}}</ref> His million-selling 1970 record ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' helped spark a resurgence in the genre's commercial popularity with [[jazz fusion]] as the decade progressed.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Segell|first=Michael|date=December 28, 1978|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-children-of-bitches-brew-19781228|title=The Children of 'Bitches Brew'|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=June 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614211236/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/the-children-of-bitches-brew-19781228|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

After a five-year retirement due to poor health, Davis resumed his career in the 1980s, employing younger musicians and [[popular music|pop]] sounds on albums such as ''[[The Man with the Horn]]'' (1981) and ''[[Tutu (album)|Tutu]]'' (1986). Critics were often unreceptive but the decade garnered Davis his highest level of commercial recognition. He performed sold-out concerts worldwide, while branching out into visual arts, film, and television work, before his death in 1991 from the combined effects of a stroke, [[pneumonia]] and [[respiratory failure]].<ref name="rsbio"/> In 2006, Davis was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]],<ref name="Miles Davis"/> which recognized him as "one of the key figures in the history of jazz".<ref name="Miles Davis"/> ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described him as "the most revered jazz trumpeter of all time, not to mention one of the most important musicians of the 20th century,"<ref name="rsbio">{{cite magazine|last1=Macnie|first1=Jim|title=Miles Davis Biography|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/miles-davis/biography|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=June 11, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170809154510/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/miles-davis/biography|archive-date=August 9, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> while [[Gerald Early]] called him inarguably one of the most influential and innovative musicians of that period.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gerald Lyn|first=Early|title=Ain't But a Place: an anthology of African American writings about St. Louis|publisher=[[Missouri History Museum]]|year=1998|isbn=1-883982-28-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781883982270/page/205 205]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781883982270/page/205}}</ref>

==Early life==
Miles Dewey Davis III was born on May 26, 1926, to an affluent African-American family in [[Alton, Illinois|Alton]], Illinois, {{convert|15|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} north of [[St. Louis]].{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=209}} He had an older sister, Dorothy Mae (1925-1996), and a younger brother, Vernon (1929-1999). His mother, Cleota Mae Henry of [[Arkansas]], was a music teacher and violinist, and his father, [[Miles Dewey Davis Jr.]], also of Arkansas, was a dentist. They owned a {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} estate near [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], Arkansas with a profitable pig farm. In Pine Bluff, he and his siblings fished, hunted, and rode horses.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=17}}{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} Davis's grandparents were the owners of an Arkansas farm where he would spend many summers.{{sfn|Warner|2014}}

In 1927, the family moved to [[East St. Louis]], Illinois. They lived on the second floor of a commercial building behind a dental office in a predominantly white neighbourhood. Davis's father would soon become distant to his children as [[Great Depression|the Great Depression]] caused him to become increasingly consumed by his job; typically working six days a week.{{sfn|Warner|2014}} From 1932 to 1934, Davis attended John Robinson Elementary School, an all-black school,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=209}} then Crispus Attucks, where he performed well in mathematics, music, and sports.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} Davis had previously attended Catholic school.{{sfn|Warner|2014}} At an early age he liked music, especially blues, big bands, and gospel.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=17}}

[[File:MilesDavisYouthHouse.EastStLouis.17thStreetandKansasAvenue.3.jpg|thumb|The house at 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis, Illinois, where Davis lived from 1939 to 1944]]

In 1935, Davis received his first trumpet as a gift from John Eubanks, a friend of his father.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}} He took lessons from "the biggest influence on my life," [[Elwood Buchanan]], a teacher and musician who was a patient of his father.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}}<ref name=":10">{{Cite web|title=A life in pictures: Miles Davis - Reader's Digest|url=https://www.readersdigest.co.uk/culture/music/a-life-in-pictures-miles-davis|access-date=June 29, 2020|website=[[Reader's Digest]]|language=en}}</ref> His mother wanted him to play the violin instead.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=19}} Against the fashion of the time, Buchanan stressed the importance of playing without [[vibrato]] and encouraged him to use a clear, mid-range tone. Davis said that whenever he started playing with heavy vibrato, Buchanan slapped his knuckles.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=19}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=32}} In later years Davis said, "I prefer a round sound with no attitude in it, like a round voice with not too much tremolo and not too much bass. Just right in the middle. If I can't get that sound I can't play anything."{{sfn|Kahn|2001}} The family soon moved to 1701 Kansas Avenue in East St. Louis.{{sfn|Warner|2014}}

According to Davis "By the age of 12, music had become the most important thing in my life."<ref name=":10" /> On his thirteenth birthday his father bought him a new trumpet,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}} and Davis began to play in local bands. He took additional trumpet lessons from Joseph Gustat, principal trumpeter of the [[St. Louis Symphony Orchestra]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}} Davis would also play the trumpet in talent shows he and his siblings would put on.{{sfn|Warner|2014}}

In 1941, the 15-year-old attended [[East St. Louis Lincoln High School]], where he joined the marching band directed by Buchanan and entered music competitions. Years later, Davis said that he was discriminated against in these competitions due to his race, but he added that these experiences made him a better musician.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=11}} When a drummer asked him to play a certain passage of music, and he couldn't do it, he began to learn [[music theory]]. "I went and got everything, every book I could get to learn about theory."{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=23}} At Lincoln, Davis met his first girlfriend, Irene Birth (later Cawthon).{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=10}} He had a band that performed at the Elks Club.<ref name="Arons">{{cite web|last1=Arons|first1=Rachel|title=Slide Show: American Public Libraries Great and Small|url=http://www.grahamfoundation.org/system/grants/press/284/original/Dawson_MediaCov_NewYorker_20140321.pdf|website=Graham Foundation|access-date=May 8, 2018|page=5|date=March 21, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509013353/http://www.grahamfoundation.org/system/grants/press/284/original/Dawson_MediaCov_NewYorker_20140321.pdf|archive-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Part of his earnings paid for his sister's education at [[Fisk University]].{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} Davis befriended trumpeter [[Clark Terry]], who suggested he play without vibrato, and performed with him for several years.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=210}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}

With encouragement from his teacher and girlfriend, Davis filled a vacant spot in the Rhumboogie Orchestra, also known as the Blue Devils, led by Eddie Randle. He became the band's musical director, which involved hiring musicians and scheduling rehearsal.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=12}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} Years later, Davis considered this job one of the most important of his career.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=23}} [[Sonny Stitt]] tried to persuade him to join the [[Tiny Bradshaw]] band, which was passing through town, but his mother insisted he finish high school before going on tour. He said later, "I didn't talk to her for two weeks. And I didn't go with the band either."{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=13}} In January 1944, Davis finished high school and graduated in absentia in June. During the next month, his girlfriend gave birth to a daughter, Cheryl.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}

In July 1944, [[Billy Eckstine]] visited St. Louis with a band that included [[Art Blakey]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], and [[Charlie Parker]]. Trumpeter Buddy Anderson was too sick to perform,{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=9}} so Davis was invited to join. He played with the band for two weeks at Club Riviera.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}} After playing with these musicians, he was certain he should move to New York City, "where the action was".{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=29}} His mother wanted him to go to Fisk University, like his sister, and study piano or violin. Davis had other interests.{{sfn|Orr|2012|p=13}}

In September 1944, Davis accepted his father's idea of studying at the [[Juilliard School|Institute of Musical Arts]], later known as the Juilliard School, in New York City.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} After passing the audition, he attended classes in music theory, piano and dictation.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=32}} Davis would frequently skip said classes.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web| date=May 22, 2020 |title= Miles Davis |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Miles-Davis|url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200526203028/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Miles-Davis|archive-date=May 26, 2020|access-date=June 22, 2020 |website= [[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|language=en}}</ref>

Much of Davis's time was spent in clubs looking for his idol, Charlie Parker. According to Davis, [[Coleman Hawkins]] told him "finish your studies at Juilliard and forget Bird [Parker]".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=56}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}} After finding Parker, he became one of a cadre of regulars at [[Minton's Playhouse|Minton's]] and [[Monroe's]] in Harlem who held jam sessions every night. The other regulars included [[J. J. Johnson]], [[Kenny Clarke]], [[Thelonious Monk]], [[Fats Navarro]], and [[Freddie Webster]]. Davis reunited with Cawthon and their daughter when they moved to New York City. Parker became a roommate.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} Around this time Davis was paid an allowance of $40 ($582 by 2020).<ref>{{Cite web|title=$40 in 1944 → 2020 {{!}} Inflation Calculator|url=https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1944?amount=40|access-date=July 1, 2020|website=In2013Dollars|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":12" />

In mid-1945, Davis failed to register for the year's autumn term at Juilliard and dropped out after three semesters{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=17}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=38}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} because he wanted to perform full-time.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=68}} Years later he criticized Juilliard for concentrating too much on classical European and "white" repertoire, but he praised the school for teaching him music theory and improving his trumpet technique.

He began performing at clubs on 52nd Street with Coleman Hawkins and [[Eddie "Lockjaw" Davis]]. He recorded for the first time on April 24, 1945, when he entered the studio as a sideman for [[Herbie Fields]]'s band.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=10}} During the next year, he recorded as a leader for the first time with the Miles Davis Sextet plus Earl Coleman and Ann Hathaway, one of the few times he accompanied a singer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plosin.com/milesAhead/Sessions.aspx?s=461018 |title=See the Plosin session database |publisher=Plosin.com |date=October 18, 1946 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511133707/http://www.plosin.com/milesAhead/Sessions.aspx?s=461018 |archive-date=May 11, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1945, he replaced Dizzy Gillespie in Charlie Parker's quintet. On November 26, Davis participated in several recording sessions as part of Parker's group Reboppers that also involved Gillespie and [[Max Roach]],{{sfn|Early|2001|p=211}} displaying hints of the style he would become known for. In Parker's tune "[[Now's the Time (composition)|Now's the Time]]", Davis played a solo that anticipated [[cool jazz]]. He then joined a big band led by [[Benny Carter]], performing in St. Louis and remaining with the band in California. He again played with Parker and Gillespie.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} In Los Angeles, Parker had a nervous breakdown that put him in the hospital for several months.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}}<ref>On this occasion, Mingus bitterly criticized Davis for abandoning his "musical father" (see [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']]).</ref> In March 1946, Davis played in studio sessions with Parker and began a collaboration with bassist [[Charles Mingus]] that summer. Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second child, Gregory, in East St. Louis before reuniting with Davis in New York City the following year.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} Davis noted that by this time, "I was still so much into the music that I was even ignoring Irene." He had also turned to alcohol and cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=105}}

He was a member of Billy Eckstine's big band in 1946 and Gillespie's in 1947.<ref name="New Grove">{{cite book|last1=Kernfeld|first1=Barry|editor1-last=Kernfeld|editor1-first=Barry|title=The New Grove Dictionary of Jazz|date=2002|publisher=Grove's Dictionaries|location=New York|isbn=1-56159-284-6|page=573|volume=1|edition=2nd}}</ref> He joined a quintet led by Parker that also included Max Roach. Together they performed live with [[Duke Jordan]] and [[Tommy Potter]] for much of the year, including several studio sessions.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} In one session that May, Davis wrote the tune "Cheryl", named after his daughter. Davis's first session as a leader followed in August 1947, playing as the Miles Davis All Stars that included Parker, pianist [[John Lewis (pianist)|John Lewis]], and bassist [[Nelson Boyd]]; they recorded "Milestones", "Half Nelson", and "Sippin' at Bells".{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=12}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} After touring Chicago and Detroit with Parker's quintet, Davis returned to New York City in March 1948 and joined the [[Jazz at the Philharmonic]] tour, which included a stop in St. Louis on April 30.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}}

===1948–1950: Miles Davis Nonet and ''Birth of the Cool''===
In August 1948, Davis declined an offer to join [[Duke Ellington]]'s orchestra as he had entered rehearsals with a nine-piece band with pianist and arranger [[Gil Evans]] and baritone saxophonist [[Gerry Mulligan]], taking an active role on what soon became his own project.<ref>{{cite web| last= Mulligan| first= Gerry| url= http://www.gerrymulligan.com/wp-content/files/auto-bio.pdf |title= I hear America singing| website= www.gerrymulligan.com| publisher= Gerry Mulligan |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160303225918/http://www.gerrymulligan.com/wp-content/files/auto-bio.pdf |archive-date= March 3, 2016 |quote= Miles, the bandleader. He took the initiative and put the theories to work. He called the rehearsals, hired the halls, called the players, and generally cracked the whip.}}</ref>{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} Evans' Manhattan apartment had become the meeting place for several young musicians and composers such as Davis, Roach, Lewis, and Mulligan who were unhappy with the increasingly virtuoso instrumental techniques that dominated bebop.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=14}} These gatherings led to the formation of the Miles Davis [[Nonet (music)|Nonet]], which included the unusual additions of French horn and tuba; leading to a thickly textured orchestral sound.<ref name=":1" /> The intent was to imitate the human voice through carefully arranged compositions and a relaxed, melodic approach to improvisation. In September, the band completed their sole engagement as the opening band for [[Count Basie]] at the [[Royal Roost]] for two weeks. Davis had to persuade the venue's manager to write the sign "Miles Davis Nonet. Arrangements by Gil Evans, John Lewis and Gerry Mulligan". Davis returned to Parker's quintet, but relationships within the quintet were growing tense mainly due to Parker's erratic behavior caused by his drug addiction.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} Early in his time with Parker, Davis abstained from drugs, ate a vegetarian diet, and spoke of the benefits of water and juice.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=2}}

In December 1948 Davis quit,{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} claiming he was not being paid. His departure began a period when he worked mainly as a freelancer and sideman. His nonet remained active until the end of 1949. After signing a contract with [[Capitol Records]], they recorded sessions in January and April 1949, which sold little but influenced the "cool" or "west coast" style of jazz.{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} The line-up changed throughout the year and included the additions of tuba player [[Bill Barber (musician)|Bill Barber]], alto saxophonist [[Lee Konitz]], pianist [[Al Haig]], trombone players [[Mike Zwerin]] with [[Kai Winding]], French horn players [[Junior Collins]] with Sandy Siegelstein and [[Gunther Schuller]], and bassists [[Al McKibbon]] and [[Joe Shulman]]. One track featured singer [[Kenny Hagood]]. The presence of white musicians in the group angered some black players, many of whom were unemployed at the time, yet Davis rebuffed their criticisms.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=117}} Recording sessions with the nonet for Capitol continued until April 1950. The Nonet recorded in total a dozen tracks which were released as singles and subsequently compiled on the 1957 album ''[[Birth of the Cool]]''.<ref name=":1" />

In May 1949, Davis performed with the [[Tadd Dameron]] Quintet with [[Kenny Clarke]] and [[James Moody (saxophonist)|James Moody]] at the [[Paris Jazz Festival|Paris International Jazz Festival]]. On his first trip abroad Davis took a strong liking for Paris and its cultural environment, where he felt black jazz musicians and people of color in general were better respected than in the U.S. The trip, he said, "changed the way I looked at things forever".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=126}} He began an affair with singer and actress [[Juliette Gréco]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=126}}

=== 1949–1955: Signing with Prestige, heroin addiction, and hard bop ===
After returning from Paris in mid-1949, he became depressed and found little work, which included a short engagement with Powell in October and guest spots in New York City, Chicago, and Detroit until January 1950.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=91}} He was falling behind in hotel rent and attempts were made to repossess his car. His heroin use became an expensive addiction, and Davis, yet to reach 24 years old, "lost my sense of discipline, lost my sense of control over my life, and started to drift".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=129}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=212}} In August 1950, Cawthon gave birth to Davis's second son, Miles IV. Davis befriended boxer [[Johnny Bratton]] and began his interest in the sport. Davis left Cawthon and his three children in New York City in the hands of a friend, jazz singer [[Betty Carter]].{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=91}} He toured with Eckstine and [[Billie Holiday]] and was arrested for heroin possession in Los Angeles. The story was reported in ''[[DownBeat]]'' magazine, which caused a further reduction in work, though he was acquitted weeks later.{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=25}} By the 1950s, Davis had become a more skilled player and was experimenting with the middle register of the trumpet alongside harmonies and rhythms.<ref name=":1" />

In January 1951, Davis's fortunes improved when he signed a one-year contract with [[Prestige Records|Prestige]] after owner [[Bob Weinstock]] became a fan of the nonet {{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=175–176}} Davis chose Lewis, trombonist [[Bennie Green]], bassist [[Percy Heath]], saxophonist [[Sonny Rollins]], and drummer [[Roy Haynes]]; they recorded what became part of ''[[Miles Davis and Horns]]'' (1956). Davis was hired for other studio dates in 1951{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=25}} and began to transcribe scores for record labels to fund his heroin addiction. His second session for Prestige was released on ''[[The New Sounds]]'' (1951), ''[[Dig (Miles Davis album)|Dig]]'' (1956), and ''[[Conception (album)|Conception]]'' (1956).{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=26}}

Davis supported his heroin habit by playing music and by living the life of a hustler, exploiting prostitutes, and receiving money from friends. By 1953, his addiction began to impair his playing. His drug habit became public in a ''DownBeat'' interview with [[Cab Calloway]], whom he never forgave as it brought him "all pain and suffering".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=164}} He returned to St. Louis and stayed with his father for several months.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=164}} After a brief period with Roach and Mingus in September 1953,{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=164–165}} he returned to his father's home, where he concentrated on addressing his addiction.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=169–170}}

Davis lived in Detroit for about six months, avoiding New York City, where it was easy to get drugs. Though he used heroin, he was still able to perform locally with [[Elvin Jones]] and [[Tommy Flanagan]] as part of [[Billy Mitchell (saxophonist)|Billy Mitchell]]'s house band at the [[Blue Bird Inn|Blue Bird]] club. He was also "pimping a little".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=171}} However, he was able to end his addiction, and, in February 1954, Davis returned to New York City, feeling good "for the first time in a long time", mentally and physically stronger, and joined a gym.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=174, 175, 184}} He informed Weinstock and [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] that he was ready to record with a quintet, which he was granted. He considered the albums that resulted from these and earlier sessions – ''[[Miles Davis Quartet (album)|Miles Davis Quartet]]'' and ''[[Miles Davis Volume 2]]'' – "very important" because he felt his performances were particularly strong.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=175}} He was paid roughly $750 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|750|1954}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for each album and refused to give away his publishing rights.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=176}}

[[File:Trumpet WahWahMute.jpg|thumb|right|During the 1950s, Davis started using a [[Harmon mute|mute]] on his trumpet. It became part of his signature sound for the rest of his career.]]

Davis abandoned the bebop style and turned to the music of pianist [[Ahmad Jamal]], whose approach and use of space influenced him.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=190}} When he returned to the studio in June 1955 to record ''The Musings of Miles'', he wanted a pianist like Jamal and chose [[Red Garland]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=190}} ''[[Blue Haze]]'' (1956), ''[[Bags' Groove]]'' (1957), ''[[Walkin']]'' (1957), and ''[[Miles Davis and the Modern Jazz Giants]]'' (1959) documented the evolution of his sound with the [[Harmon mute]] placed close to the microphone, and the use of more spacious and relaxed phrasing. He assumed a central role in [[hard bop]], less radical in harmony and melody, and used popular songs and American standards as starting points for improvisation. Hard bop distanced itself from cool jazz with a harder beat and music inspired by the blues.<ref>Open references to the blues in jazz playing were fairly recent. Until the middle of the 1930s, as Coleman Hawkins declared to [[Alan Lomax]] (''The Land Where the Blues Began.'' New York: Pantheon, 1993), African-American players working in white establishments would avoid references to the blues altogether.</ref> A few critics consider ''Walkin' ''(April 1954) the album that created the hard bop genre.{{sfn|Kahn|2001}}

Davis gained a reputation for being cold, distant—and easily angered. He wrote that in 1954 [[Sugar Ray Robinson]] "was the most important thing in my life besides music", and he adopted Robinson's "arrogant attitude".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=183}} He showed contempt for critics and the press.

Davis had an operation to remove polyps from his larynx in October 1955.{{sfn|Szwed|2004}} The doctors told him to remain silent after the operation, but he got into an argument that permanently damaged his vocal cords and gave him a raspy voice for the rest of his life.<ref>Acquired by shouting at a record producer while still ailing after a recent operation to the throat – [[#Bio|''The Autobiography'']].</ref> He was called the "prince of darkness", adding a patina of mystery to his public persona.{{efn|Writers began to refer to Davis as "the Prince of Darkness" in liner notes of the records of this period, and the moniker persisted.<ref>{{cite news| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1367/is_199111/ai_n5603401/ |title= Prince of darkness.

=== 1955–1959: Signing with Columbia, first quintet, and modal jazz ===
In July 1955, Davis's fortunes improved considerably when he played at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]], with a line-up of Monk, Heath, drummer [[Connie Kay]], and horn players [[Zoot Sims]] and [[Gerry Mulligan]].{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=73}}<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last= Natambu|first=Kofi|date=September 22, 2014|title=Miles Davis: A New Revolution in Sound|url=https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?p=LitRC&sw=w&issn=10893148&v=2.1&it=r&id=GALE%7CA393059770&sid=googleScholar&linkaccess=abs|journal=Black Renaissance/Renaissance Noire |language= en|volume=14|issue=2|pages=36–40|access-date=June 27, 2020}}</ref> The performance was praised by critics and audiences alike, who considered it to be a highlight of the session as well as helping Davis, the least well known musician in the group, to increase his popularity among affluent white audiences.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=27}}<ref name=":3" /> He tied with Dizzy Gillespie for best trumpeter in the 1955 ''DownBeat'' magazine Readers' Poll.{{sfn|Cook|2007|pp=43–44}}

[[George Avakian]] of [[Columbia Records]] heard Davis perform at Newport and wanted to sign him to the label. Davis had one year left on his contract with Prestige, which required him to release four more albums. He signed a contract with Columbia that included a $4,000 advance (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|4000|1955}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) and a condition that his recordings for Columbia would remain unreleased until his agreement with Prestige expired.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=96}}{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=192}}

At the request of Avakian, he formed the [[Miles Davis Quintet]] for a performance at [[Café Bohemia]]. The quintet contained Sonny Rollins on tenor saxophone, [[Red Garland]] on piano, [[Paul Chambers]] on double bass, and [[Philly Joe Jones]] on drums. Rollins was replaced by [[John Coltrane]], completing the membership of the first quintet. This group appeared on his final albums for Prestige, which were recorded in [[The Legendary Prestige Quintet Sessions|two one-day sessions in 1956]]. Each album helped establish Davis's quintet as one of the best.{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=223}}{{sfn|Cook|2007|p=45}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=99}}

The style of the group was an extension of their experience playing with Davis. He played long, legato, melodic lines, while Coltrane contrasted with energetic solos. Their live repertoire was a mix of bebop, standards from the [[Great American Songbook]] and pre-bop eras, and traditional tunes. They appeared on ''[['Round About Midnight]]'', Davis's first album for Columbia.

In 1956, he left his quintet temporarily to tour Europe as part of the Birdland All-Stars, which included the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]] and French and German musicians. In Paris, he reunited with Gréco and they "remained lovers for many years".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=186}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=215}} He then returned home, reunited his quintet and toured the US for two months. Conflict arose on tour as he grew impatient with the drug habits of Jones and Coltrane. Davis was trying to live a healthier life by exercising and reducing his alcohol. But he continued to use cocaine.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=209}} At the end of the tour, he fired Jones and Coltrane and replaced them with Sonny Rollins and [[Art Taylor]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=214}}

In November 1957, Davis went to Paris and recorded the [[Ascenseur pour l'échafaud (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to ''Ascenseur pour l'échafaud''<ref name="New Grove" /> directed by [[Louis Malle]]. Consisting of French jazz musicians [[Barney Wilen]], [[Pierre Michelot]], and [[René Urtreger]], and American drummer [[Kenny Clarke]], the group avoided a written score and instead improvised while they watched the film in a recording studio.

After returning to New York, Davis revived his quintet with Adderley<ref name="New Grove" /> and Coltrane, who was clean from his drug habit. Now a sextet, the group recorded material in early 1958 that was released on ''[[Milestones (Miles Davis album)|Milestones]]'', an album that demonstrated Davis's interest in [[modal jazz]]. A performance by [[Les Ballets Africains]] drew him to slower, deliberate music that allowed the creation of solos from harmony rather than chords.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=97}}

By May 1958, he had replaced Jones with drummer [[Jimmy Cobb]], and Garland left the group, leaving Davis to play piano on "Sid's Ahead" for ''Milestones''.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=224}} He wanted someone who could play modal jazz, so he hired [[Bill Evans]], a young pianist with a background in classical music.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=229}} Evans had an impressionistic approach to piano. His ideas greatly influenced Davis. But after eight months of touring, a tired Evans left. [[Wynton Kelly]], his replacement, brought to the group a swinging style that contrasted with Evans's delicacy. The sextet made their recording debut on ''[[Jazz Track]]'' (1958).{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=229}}

===1957–1963: Collaborations with Gil Evans and ''Kind of Blue''===
By early 1957, Davis was exhausted from recording and touring and wished to pursue new projects. In March, the 30-year-old Davis told journalists of his intention to retire imminently and revealed offers he had received to become a teacher at [[Harvard University]] and a musical director at a record label.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=139}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian agreed that it was time for Davis to explore something different, but Davis rejected his suggestion of returning to his nonet as he considered that a step backward.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=107}} Avakian then suggested that he work with a bigger ensemble, similar to ''Music for Brass'' (1957), an album of orchestral and brass-arranged music led by [[Gunther Schuller]] featuring Davis as a guest soloist.

Davis accepted and worked with Gil Evans in what became a five-album collaboration from 1957 to 1962.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=140}} ''[[Miles Ahead (album)|Miles Ahead]]'' (1957) showcased Davis on flugelhorn and a rendition of "The Maids of Cadiz" by [[Léo Delibes]], the first piece of classical music that Davis recorded. Evans devised orchestral passages as transitions, thus turning the album into one long piece of music.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=141}}<ref>Cook, op. cit.</ref> ''[[Porgy and Bess (Miles Davis album)|Porgy and Bess]]'' (1959) includes arrangements of pieces from George Gershwin's [[Porgy and Bess|opera]]. ''[[Sketches of Spain]]'' (1960) contained music by [[Joaquín Rodrigo]] and [[Manuel de Falla]] and originals by Evans. The classical musicians had trouble improvising, while the jazz musicians couldn't handle the difficult arrangements, but the album was a critical success, selling over 120,000 copies in the US.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=108}} Davis performed with an orchestra conducted by Evans at Carnegie Hall in May 1961 to raise money for charity.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=109}} The pair's final album was ''[[Quiet Nights (Miles Davis and Gil Evans album)|Quiet Nights]]'' (1962), a collection of [[bossa nova]] songs released against their wishes. Evans stated it was only half an album and blamed the record company; Davis blamed producer [[Teo Macero]] and refused to speak to him for more than two years.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=192–193}} The boxed set ''[[Miles Davis & Gil Evans: The Complete Columbia Studio Recordings]]'' (1996) won the [[Grammy Award for Best Historical Album]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Album Notes|Best Album Notes]] in 1997.

In March and April 1959, Davis recorded what many critics consider his greatest album, ''[[Kind of Blue]]''. He named the album for its mood.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=106}} He called back Bill Evans, as the music had been planned around Evans's piano style.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} Both Davis and Evans were familiar with [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]]'s ideas about modal jazz.{{sfn|Kahn|2001|pp=29–30}}{{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=74}} But Davis neglected to tell pianist Wynton Kelly that Evans was returning, so Kelly appeared on only one song, "[[Freddie Freeloader]]". {{sfn|Kahn|2001|p=95}} The sextet had played "[[So What (instrumental)|So What]]" and "[[All Blues]]" at performances, but the remaining three compositions they saw for the first time in the studio.

Released in August 1959, ''Kind of Blue'' was an instant success, with widespread radio airplay and rave reviews from critics.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=106}} It has remained a strong seller over the years.

In August 1959, during a break in a recording session at the [[Birdland (jazz club)|Birdland]] nightclub in New York City, Davis was escorting a blonde-haired woman to a taxi outside the club when he was assaulted by a racist policeman Gerald Kilduff who beat him without provocation after telling Davis to "move on".{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History |2007 |p=100 }}<ref name="arrest"/> Davis said that he was working at the club, and he refused to move.<ref>{{cite news |title=Jazz Trumpeter Miles Davis In Joust With Cops |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3PQeAAAAIBAJ&pg=2499,2153156&dq=miles-davis+arrested&hl=en |access-date=August 27, 2010 |newspaper=Sarasota Journal |date=August 26, 1959 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809082309/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=3PQeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=4ooEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2499,2153156&dq=miles-davis+arrested&hl=en |archive-date=August 9, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kilduff arrested and grabbed Davis as he tried to protect himself.

[[File:Miles-Davis-1964-Helsinki.jpg|thumb|right|Davis performing at [[Töölö Sports Hall]] (Messuhalli) in [[Helsinki]], Finland, in October 1964]]
In December 1962, Davis, Kelly, Chambers, Cobb, and Rollins played together for the last time as the first three wanted to leave and play as a trio. Rollins left them soon after, leaving Davis to pay over $25,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1962}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) to cancel upcoming gigs and quickly assemble a new group. Following auditions, he found his new band in tenor saxophonist [[George Coleman]], bassist [[Ron Carter]], pianist [[Victor Feldman]], and drummer [[Frank Butler (musician)|Frank Butler]].{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=260–262}} By May 1963, Feldman and Butler were replaced by pianist [[Herbie Hancock]] and 17-year-old drummer [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]] who made Davis "excited all over again".{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=262}} With this group, Davis completed the rest of what became ''[[Seven Steps to Heaven]]'' (1963) and recorded the live albums ''[[Miles Davis in Europe]]'' (1964), ''[[My Funny Valentine (Miles Davis album)|My Funny Valentine]]'' (1965), and ''[[Four & More]]'' (1966). The quintet played essentially the same bebop tunes and standards that Davis's previous bands had played, but they approached them with structural and rhythmic freedom and occasionally breakneck speed.

In 1964, Coleman was briefly replaced by saxophonist [[Sam Rivers (jazz musician)|Sam Rivers]] (who recorded with Davis on ''[[Miles in Tokyo]]'') until  [[Wayne Shorter]] was persuaded to leave [[Art Blakey]]. The quintet with Shorter lasted through 1968, with the saxophonist becoming the group's principal composer. The album ''E.S.P.'' (1965) was named after his composition. While touring Europe, the group made its first album, ''[[Miles in Berlin]]'' (1965).{{sfn|Einarson|2005|pp=56–57}}

Davis needed medical attention for hip pain, which had worsened since his Japanese tour during the previous year.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=202}} He underwent hip replacement surgery in April 1965, with bone taken from his shin, but it failed. After his third month in the hospital, he discharged himself due to boredom and went home. He returned to the hospital in August after a fall required the insertion of a plastic hip joint.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=203}} In November 1965, he had recovered enough to return to performing with his quintet, which included [[The Complete Live at the Plugged Nickel 1965|gigs at the Plugged Nickel]] in Chicago. Teo Macero returned as his record producer after their rift over ''Quiet Nights'' had healed.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=282–283}}{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=204}}

In January 1966, Davis spent three months in the hospital due to a liver infection. When he resumed touring, he performed more at colleges because he had grown tired of the typical jazz venues.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=283}} Columbia president [[Clive Davis]] reported in 1966 his sales had declined to around 40,000–50,000 per album, compared to as many as 100,000 per release a few years before. Matters were not helped by the press reporting his apparent financial troubles and imminent demise.{{sfn|Carr|1998|pp=209–210}} After his appearance at the 1966 Newport Jazz Festival, he returned to the studio with his quintet for a series of sessions. He started a relationship with actress [[Cicely Tyson]], who helped him reduce his alcohol consumption.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=284}}

Material from the 1966–1968 sessions was released on ''[[Miles Smiles (album)|Miles Smiles]]'' (1966), ''[[Sorcerer (Miles Davis album)|Sorcerer]]'' (1967), ''[[Nefertiti (Miles Davis album)|Nefertiti]]'' (1967), ''[[Miles in the Sky (album)|Miles in the Sky]]'' (1968), and ''[[Filles de Kilimanjaro]]'' (1968). The quintet's approach to the new music became known as "time no changes"—which referred to Davis's decision to depart from chordal sequences and adopt a more open approach, with the rhythm section responding to the soloists' melodies.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=49}} Through ''Nefertiti'' the studio recordings consisted primarily of originals composed by Shorter, with occasional compositions by the other sidemen. In 1967, the group began to play their concerts in continuous sets, each tune flowing into the next, with only the melody indicating any sort of change. His bands performed this way until his hiatus in 1975.

''Miles in the Sky'' and ''Filles de Kilimanjaro''—which tentatively introduced electric bass, electric piano, and electric guitar on some tracks—pointed the way to the [[jazz fusion|fusion]] phase of Davis's career. He also began experimenting with more rock-oriented rhythms on these records. By the time the second half of ''Filles de Kilimanjaro'' was recorded, bassist [[Dave Holland]] and pianist [[Chick Corea]] had replaced Carter and Hancock. Davis soon took over the compositional duties of his sidemen.

''[[In a Silent Way]]'' was recorded in a single studio session in February 1969, with Shorter, Hancock, Holland, and Williams alongside keyboardists [[Chick Corea]] and [[Josef Zawinul]] and guitarist [[John McLaughlin (musician)|John McLaughlin]]. The album contains two side-long tracks that Macero pieced together from different takes recorded at the session. When the album was released later that year, some critics accused him of "selling out" to the rock and roll audience. Nevertheless, it reached number 134 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' Top LPs]] chart, his first album since ''My Funny Valentine'' to reach the chart. ''In a Silent Way'' was his entry into jazz fusion. The touring band of 1969–1970—with Shorter, Corea, Holland, and DeJohnette—never completed a studio recording together, and became known as Davis's "lost quintet", though radio broadcasts from the band's European tour have been extensively bootlegged.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/01/30/170662462/a-1969-bootleg-unearths-miles-davis-lost-quintet|title=A 1969 Bootleg Unearths Miles Davis' 'Lost' Quintet| first= Tom |last= Moon|website=NPR|date=January 30, 2013|access-date=April 5, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180427120809/https://www.npr.org/2013/01/30/170662462/a-1969-bootleg-unearths-miles-davis-lost-quintet|archive-date=April 27, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17676-the-bootleg-series-volume-2-live-in-europe-1969/ |title=Miles Davis | first= Hank |last= Shteamer |website=Pitchfork |date=January 31, 2013 |access-date=April 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411222550/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/17676-the-bootleg-series-volume-2-live-in-europe-1969/ |archive-date=April 11, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In October 1969, Davis was shot at five times while in his car with one of his two lovers, Marguerite Eskridge. The incident left him with a graze and Eskridge unharmed.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=150}} In 1970, Marguerite gave birth to their son Erin.

For the double album ''[[Bitches Brew]]'' (1970), he hired [[Jack DeJohnette]], [[Airto Moreira]], and [[Bennie Maupin]]. The album contained long compositions, some over twenty minutes, that were never played in the studio but were constructed from several takes by Macero and Davis via splicing and tape loops amid epochal advances in multitrack recording technologies.{{sfn|Freeman|2005|pp=83–84}} ''Bitches Brew'' peaked at No. 35 on the ''Billboard'' Album chart.<ref name="Bitches">{{cite magazine |title=Miles Davis |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/miles-davis |magazine=Billboard |access-date=May 10, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316122024/https://www.billboard.com/music/miles-davis |archive-date=March 16, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1976, it was certified gold for selling over 500,000 records.

In March 1970, Davis began to perform as the opening act for rock acts, allowing Columbia to market ''Bitches Brew'' to a larger audience.

By 1971, Davis had signed a contract with Columbia that paid him $100,000 a year (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1971}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for three years in addition to royalties.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=302}} He recorded a soundtrack album (''[[Jack Johnson (album)|Jack Johnson]]'') for the [[Jack Johnson (film)|1970 documentary film]] about heavyweight boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], containing two long pieces of 25 and 26 minutes in length with Hancock, McLaughlin, [[Sonny Sharrock]], and [[Billy Cobham]]. He was committed to making music for African-Americans who liked more commercial, pop, groove-oriented music. By November 1971, DeJohnette and Moreira had been replaced in the touring ensemble by drummer [[Leon "Ndugu" Chancler]] and percussionists [[James Mtume]] and [[Don Alias]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=191 |title=roio » Blog Archive » MILES – BELGRADE 1971 |publisher=Bigozine2.com |access-date=July 17, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721032949/https://bigozine2.com/roio/?p=191 |archive-date=July 21, 2015  }}</ref> ''[[Live-Evil (Miles Davis album)|Live-Evil]]'' was released in the same month. Showcasing bassist [[Michael Henderson]], who had replaced Holland in 1970, the album demonstrated that Davis's ensemble had transformed into a funk-oriented group while retaining the exploratory imperative of ''Bitches Brew''.

In 1972, composer-arranger [[Paul Buckmaster]] introduced Davis to the music of avant-garde composer [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], leading to a period of creative exploration. Biographer J. K. Chambers wrote, "The effect of Davis' study of Stockhausen could not be repressed for long ... Davis' own 'space music' shows Stockhausen's influence compositionally."{{sfn|Chambers|1998|p=246}} His recordings and performances during this period were described as "space music" by fans, Feather, and Buckmaster, who described it as "a lot of mood changes—heavy, dark, intense—definitely space music".{{sfn|Carr|1998}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.miles-beyond.com/bitchesbrew.htm |title=The Making of The Complete Bitches Brew Sessions |last=Tingen |first=Paul |date=1999 |access-date=April 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170305160246/http://www.miles-beyond.com/bitchesbrew.htm |archive-date=March 5, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> The studio album ''[[On the Corner]]'' (1972) blended the influence of Stockhausen and Buckmaster with funk elements.

Davis felt that Columbia marketed it to the wrong audience. "The music was meant to be heard by young black people, but they just treated it like any other jazz album and advertised it that way, pushed it on the jazz radio stations. Young black kids don't listen to those stations; they listen to R&B stations and some rock stations."{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=328}} In October 1972, he broke his ankles in a car crash.

{{Quote box

| quote = This was music that polarized audiences, provoking boos and walk-outs amid the ecstasy of others. The length, density, and unforgiving nature of it mocked those who said that Miles was interested only in being trendy and popular. Some have heard in this music the feel and shape of a musician's late work, an egoless music that precedes its creator's death. As [[Theodor Adorno]] said of the late [[Beethoven]], the disappearance of the musician into the work is a bow to mortality. It was as if Miles were testifying to all that he had been witness to for the past thirty years, both terrifying and joyful.

After recording ''On the Corner'', he assembled a group with Henderson, Mtume, [[Carlos Garnett]], guitarist [[Reggie Lucas]], organist [[Lonnie Liston Smith]], tabla player [[Badal Roy]], sitarist [[Khalil Balakrishna]], and drummer [[Al Foster]]. Only Smith was a jazz instrumentalist; consequently, the music emphasized rhythmic density and shifting textures instead of solos. This group was recorded live in 1972 for ''[[In Concert (Miles Davis album)|In Concert]]'', but Davis found it unsatisfactory, leading him to drop the tabla and sitar and play keyboards. He also added guitarist [[Pete Cosey]]. The compilation studio album ''[[Big Fun (Miles Davis album)|Big Fun]]'' contains four long improvisations recorded between 1969 and 1972.

Studio sessions throughout 1973 and 1974 led to ''[[Get Up with It]]'', an album which included four long pieces alongside four shorter recordings from 1970 and 1972. The track "He Loved Him Madly", a thirty-minute tribute to the recently deceased Duke Ellington, presaged later developments in [[ambient music]].<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/jazz.shopping|title=The most hated album in jazz|first=Paul|last=Tingen|date=October 26, 2007| access-date=June 13, 2019|via= theguardian.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190802180624/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/oct/26/jazz.shopping|archive-date=August 2, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In the United States, it performed comparably to ''On the Corner'', reaching number 8 on the jazz chart and number 141 on the pop chart. He then concentrated on live performance with a series of concerts that Columbia released on the double live albums ''[[Agharta (album)|Agharta]]'' (1975), ''[[Pangaea (album)|Pangaea]]'' (1976), and ''[[Dark Magus]]'' (1977). The first two are recordings of two sets from February 1, 1975, in Osaka, by which time Davis was troubled by several physical ailments; he relied on alcohol, codeine, and morphine to get through the engagements. His shows were routinely panned by critics who mentioned his habit of performing with his back to the audience.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=177}} Cosey later asserted that "the band really advanced after the Japanese tour",{{sfn|Tingen|2001|p=167}} but Davis was again hospitalized, for his ulcers and a hernia, during a tour of the US while opening for Herbie Hancock.

After appearances at the 1975 Newport Jazz Festival in July and the [[Schaefer Music Festival]] in New York in September, Davis dropped out of music.{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History |2007 |p=177 }}<ref>{{cite web| first= Laurent |last= Cugny|title=1975: the end of an intrigue?

===1975–1980: Hiatus===
In his autobiography, Davis wrote frankly about his life during his hiatus from music. He called his [[Upper West Side]] brownstone a wreck and chronicled his heavy use of alcohol and cocaine, in addition to his sexual encounters with many women.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=330}} He also stated that "Sex and drugs took the place music had occupied in my life." Drummer Tony Williams recalled that by noon (on average) Davis would be sick from the previous night's intake.<ref name=":11" />

In December 1975, he had regained enough strength to undergo a much needed hip replacement operation.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=76}} In December 1976, Columbia was reluctant to renew his contract and pay his usual large advances. But after his lawyer started negotiating with [[United Artists Records|United Artists]], Columbia matched their offer, establishing the Miles Davis Fund to pay him regularly. Pianist [[Vladimir Horowitz]] was the only other musician with Columbia who had a similar status.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=329}}

In 1978, Davis asked fusion guitarist [[Larry Coryell]] to participate in sessions with keyboardists [[Masabumi Kikuchi]] and George Pavlis, bassist [[T. M. Stevens]], and drummer [[Al Foster]].{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=36}} Davis played the arranged piece uptempo, abandoned his trumpet for the organ, and had Macero record the session without the band's knowledge. After Coryell declined a spot in a band that Davis was beginning to put together, Davis returned to his reclusive lifestyle in New York City.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=347}}{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=77, 78}} Soon after, Marguerite Eskridge had Davis jailed for failing to pay child support to their son Erin, which cost him $10,000 (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1978}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) for release on bail.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=36}}{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=76}} A recording session that involved Buckmaster and Gil Evans was halted,{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=38}} with Evans leaving after failing to receive the payment he was promised. In August 1978, Davis hired a new manager, Mark Rothbaum, who had worked with him since 1972.{{sfn|Szwed|2004|p=358}}

[[File:Miles Davis and Cicely Tyson 1982.jpg|thumb|Davis and Cicely Tyson in 1982]]
By 1979, Davis had rekindled his relationship with actress [[Cicely Tyson]], with whom he overcame his cocaine addiction and regained his enthusiasm for music. The two married in November 1981,{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|p=348}}{{sfn|The Complete Illustrated History |2007 |p=180}} but their tumultuous marriage ended with Tyson filing for divorce in 1988, which was finalized in 1989.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=390–391}}

===1980–1985: Comeback===
Having played the trumpet little throughout the previous three years, Davis found it difficult to reclaim his [[embouchure]]. His first post-hiatus studio appearance took place in May 1980.{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=79}} A day later, Davis was hospitalized due to a leg infection.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=349}} He recorded ''[[The Man with the Horn]]'' from June 1980 to May 1981 with Macero producing. A large band was abandoned in favor of a combo with saxophonist [[Bill Evans (saxophonist)|Bill Evans]] and bassist [[Marcus Miller]]. Both would collaborate with him during the next decade.

''The Man with the Horn'' received a poor critical reception despite selling well. In June 1981, Davis returned to the stage for the first time since 1975 in a ten-minute guest solo as part of [[Mel Lewis]]'s band at the [[Village Vanguard]].{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=92}} This was followed by appearances with a new band.{{sfn|Carr|1998|p=363}}{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=77}} Recordings from a mixture of dates from 1981, including from the Kix in Boston and Avery Fisher Hall, were released on ''[[We Want Miles]]'',{{sfn|Morton|2005|p=78}} which earned him a Grammy Award for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance by a Soloist.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=180}}

[[File:Miles Davis 23.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Davis performing in 1985]]
In January 1982, while Tyson was working in Africa, Davis "went a little wild" with alcohol, and suffered a stroke that temporarily paralyzed his right hand.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=348–350}}{{sfn|Early|2001|p=222}} Tyson returned home and cared for him. After three months of treatment with a Chinese acupuncturist, he was able to play the trumpet again. He listened to his doctor's warnings and gave up alcohol and drugs. He credited Tyson with helping his recovery, which involved exercise, piano playing, and visits to spas. She encouraged him to draw, which he pursued for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=348–350}}

Davis resumed touring in May 1982 with a line-up that included percussionist [[Mino Cinelu]] and guitarist [[John Scofield]], with whom he worked closely on the album ''[[Star People]]'' (1983). In mid-1983, he worked on the tracks for ''[[Decoy (album)|Decoy]]'', an album mixing soul music and [[electronica]] that was released in 1984. He brought in producer, composer, and keyboardist [[Robert Irving III]], who had collaborated with him on ''The Man with the Horn''. With a seven-piece band that included Scofield, Evans, Irving, Foster, and [[Darryl Jones]], he played a series of European performances that were positively received. In December 1984, while in Denmark, he was awarded the [[Léonie Sonning Music Prize]]. Trumpeter [[Palle Mikkelborg]] had written "Aura", a contemporary classical piece, for the event which impressed Davis to the point of returning to Denmark in early 1985 to record his next studio album, ''[[Aura (Miles Davis album)|Aura]]''.{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=183}} Columbia was dissatisfied with the recording and delayed its release.

Also in 1984, Davis met 34-year-old sculptor Jo Gelbard.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|title=Interview: Jo Gelbard: The Dark Arts |url= https://www.thelastmiles.com/interviews-jo-gelbard/|access-date=June 28, 2020|website=The Last Miles|language=en-GB|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200424103257/https://www.thelastmiles.com/interviews-jo-gelbard/|archive-date=April 24, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Gelbard would teach Davis how to paint; the two were frequent collaborators and were soon romantically engaged.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":8" /> By 1985, Davis was diabetic and required daily injections of insulin.{{sfn|Davis|Troupe|1989|pp=363–64}}

In May 1985, one month into a tour, Davis signed a contract with [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] that required him to give up his publishing rights.{{sfn|Cole|2005|p=352}}{{sfn|''The Complete Illustrated History''|2007|p=194}} ''[[You're Under Arrest (Miles Davis album)|You're Under Arrest]]'', his final album for Columbia, was released in September. It included cover versions of two pop songs: "[[Time After Time (Cyndi Lauper song)|Time After Time]]" by [[Cyndi Lauper]] and [[Michael Jackson]]'s "[[Human Nature (Michael Jackson song)|Human Nature]]". He considered releasing an album of pop songs, and he recorded dozens of them, but the idea was rejected. He said that many of today's jazz standards had been pop songs in [[Broadway theater]] and that he was simply updating the standards repertoire.

Davis collaborated with a number of figures from the British post-punk and new wave movements during this period, including [[Scritti Politti]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.intro.de/magazin/musik/23035596?current_page=1 |title=Scritti Politti – Pop – INTRO | website= Intro.de |access-date=July 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000939/http://www.intro.de/magazin/musik/23035596?current_page=1 |archive-date=December 3, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> This period also saw Davis move from his funk inspired sound of the early 70s to a more melodic style.<ref name= ":12">{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Richard|date=July 13, 1985|title=Miles Davis: Miles Runs The Voodoo Down| journal= NME|via=Rock's Backpages}}</ref>

==Views on his earlier work==
Late in his life, from the "electric period" onwards, Davis repeatedly explained his reasons for not wishing to perform his earlier works, such as ''[[Birth of the Cool]]'' or ''[[Kind of Blue]]''. In his view, remaining stylistically static was the wrong option.{{sfn|Davis|Sultanof|2002|pp=2–3}} He commented: {{"'}}So What' or ''Kind of Blue'', they were done in that era, the right hour, the right day, and it happened. It's over&nbsp;... What I used to play with Bill Evans, all those different modes, and substitute chords, we had the energy then and we liked it. But I have no feel for it anymore, it's more like warmed-over turkey."<ref name="Bill">{{cite web |last1=Kahn |first1=Ashley |title=Miles Davis and Bill Evans: Miles and Bill in Black & White |url=https://jazztimes.com/features/miles-davis-and-bill-evans-miles-and-bill-in-black-white/ |website=JazzTimes.com |access-date= December 15, 2018 |date=September 1, 2001a |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143448/https://jazztimes.com/features/miles-davis-and-bill-evans-miles-and-bill-in-black-white/ |archive-date=March 22, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> When [[Shirley Horn]] insisted in 1990 that Miles reconsider playing the ballads and modal tunes of his ''Kind of Blue'' period, he said: "Nah, it hurts my lip."<ref name="Bill" /> [[Bill Evans]], who played piano on ''Kind of Blue'', said: "I would like to hear more of the consummate melodic master, but I feel that big business and his record company have had a corrupting influence on his material. The rock and pop thing certainly draws a wider audience."<ref name="Bill" /> Throughout his later career, Davis declined offers to reinstate his '60s quintet.<ref name=":11" />

Many books and documentaries focus on his work before 1975.<ref name=":11" /> According to an article by ''[[The Independent]]'', from 1975 onwards a decline in critical praise for Davis's output began to form, with many viewing the era as "worthless": "There is a surprisingly widespread view that, in terms of the merits of his musical output, Davis might as well have died in 1975."<ref name=":11" /> In a 1982 interview in ''[[DownBeat]]'', [[Wynton Marsalis]] said: "They call Miles's stuff jazz. That stuff is not jazz, man. Just because somebody played jazz at one time, that doesn't mean they're still playing it."<ref name=":11" /> Despite his contempt for Davis' later work, Marsalis' work is "laden with ironic references to Davis' music of the '60s".<ref name=":12" />  Davis did not necessarily disagree; lambasting what he saw as Marsalis's stylistic conservatism, Davis said "Jazz is dead&nbsp;... it's finito!

His position in that tradition, and his personality, talents, and artistic interests, impelled him to pursue a uniquely individual solution to the problems and the experiential possibilities of improvised performance.</blockquote>
