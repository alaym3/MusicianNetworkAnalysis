'''HMLTD''' are an English [[art punk]] band from [[London]], formed in 2015. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Henry Spychalski, guitarists James Donovan and Duc Peterman, bassist Nico Mohnblatt, drummer Achilleas Sarantaris and live keyboardist Seth Evans.

== Background ==
HMLTD formed in [[London]] as Happy Meal Ltd. in early 2015.  Singer Henry Spychalski was born and raised in [[Torquay]] before moving to London.<ref name="connick nov 2017">{{cite web |last1=Connick |first1=Tom |title=Whatever rock is, HMLTD is changing it |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/hmltd-henry-spychalski-interview |website=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |publisher=Nikic Media |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=29 November 2017}}</ref>  Spychalski met Duc, who had played in a band with Nico in [[Paris]], at a bar in London which helped foster a friendship and the formation of the band.<ref name="connick nov 2017"/><ref name="whitehouse may 2017">{{cite web |last1=Whitehouse |first1=Matthew |title=hmltd are the glitter kids ripping up london's music scene |url=https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/mbve48/hmltd-are-the-glitter-kids-ripping-up-londons-music-scene |website=[[i-D]] |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=3 May 2017}}</ref>  James originates from [[Ipswich]] and shared a house in [[Elephant and Castle]] with friends including Henry.  Zac, from [[Bristol]], met Duc through [[Reddit]] and "less vile corners" of [[4chan]], and Vincent from [[Hong Kong]]; when he returned home in late 2015 he was replaced by Achilleas, originally from [[Athens]]. Late in 2019, Zac left the band to focus on his education, he was replaced by Seth Evans, a friend of the band, who they met in [[London]].

HMLTD has been criticised for allegedly appropriating queer and/or [[gender bender]] aesthetics as [[heterosexual]] men, including [[cross-dressing]], make-up, and flamboyant performances.<ref name="hall may 2017">{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=Jake |title=Are HMLTD Queerness Tourists or Guitar Music's Greatest Hope? |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_ca/article/nz847x/hmltd-queerness-guitar-music-gender-identity |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Noisey]] |publisher=[[Vice Media]] |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=15 May 2017}}</ref>  According to Spychalski, the band is "trying to challenge toxic masculinity and we’re doing that from the perspective we can do that from, as the human beings we were born into being, which is predominantly straight cis men. But I don’t think having that role should exclude or prohibit you from taking on that political perspective and from taking on what is probably the most violent, toxic, cruel force in our society. We’re learning from queer methods and we always try to express that indebtedness.”<ref>https://diymag.com/2020/03/02/dances-with-the-devil-hmltd-march-2020-interview</ref>

Their image and sound can be seen as influenced by the Ziggy Stardust era of [[David Bowie]] and the [[New Romantic]] period in the 1980s. Their sound has been compared to a wide range of acts such as [[The Prodigy]] and [[Peaches (musician)|Peaches]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Beaumont |first1=Mark |title=HMLTD: The UK's most thrilling new band interviewed |url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/hmltd-interviewed-london-2017-2025371#TqL4U7Sfx2StPWig.99 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=22 March 2017}}</ref> They have also been regarded as [[avant-garde]] for their infusion of EDM and experimental pop with their guitar-oriented sound.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bromwich |first1=Kathryn |title=One to watch: HMLTD |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/apr/23/one-to-watch-hmltd-interview |website=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group|GMG]] |accessdate=23 September 2018 |date=23 April 2017 |quote=This guitar band with a taste for the avant-garde are the latest outfit to be hailed as rock’s saviours}}</ref>

On 7 February 2020, HMLTD released their debut studio album ''[[West of Eden (album)|West of Eden]]''. According to lead singer, Henry Spychalski, the album took almost four years to create, due to the interspersed writing as every member was in university education. The album tour swiftly followed the release, spanning the length of the [[UK]], as well as various European cities.
