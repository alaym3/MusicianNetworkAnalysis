'''De La Soul''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|d|eɪ|_|l|ɑː|_|ˈ|s|oʊ|l}}) is an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[Trio (music)|trio]] formed in 1988 in the [[Amityville]] area of [[Long Island, New York]].<ref name="Britannica" /> They are best known for their eclectic sampling, quirky lyrics, and their contributions to the evolution of the [[jazz rap]] and [[alternative hip hop]] subgenres. The members are [[Kelvin Mercer|Posdnuos]], [[David Jude Jolicoeur|Trugoy]] and [[Vincent Mason|Maseo]]. The three formed the group in high school and caught the attention of [[record producer|producer]] [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] with a demo tape of the song "[[Plug Tunin']]". With its playful wordplay, innovative sampling, and witty skits, the band's debut album, ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'', has been called "a hip hop masterpiece."<ref>{{cite news|title='3 Feet High and Rising' a hip-hop masterpiece|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/3-feet-high-and-rising-hip-hop-masterpiece|newspaper=[[The Michigan Daily]]|access-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921063629/http://www.michigandaily.com/content/3-feet-high-and-rising-hip-hop-masterpiece|archive-date=September 21, 2013}}</ref>

The album was the band's biggest commercial success to date, with subsequent ones selling progressively less, despite receiving high praise from critics. They were influential in the early stages of rapper/actor [[Mos Def]]'s career, and are a core part of the Spitkicker collective. They are the second longest standing [[Native Tongues]] group, after the [[Jungle Brothers]]. In 2006, the group won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for their collaboration with [[Gorillaz]] on the single "[[Feel Good Inc.]]"<ref name="grammywin">{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/full-list-of-grammy-award-winners-525647.html |title = Full list of Grammy award winners |access-date = February 6, 2009 |date = February 9, 2006 |newspaper = [[The Independent]] |url-status = dead |archive-url = http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110223233247/https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/full-list-of-grammy-award-winners-525647.html |archive-date = February 23, 2011 }}</ref>

In early 2015, they announced plans to release a [[Kickstarter]] funded upcoming 9th studio album ''[[And the Anonymous Nobody]]'' in September 2015; it was released on August 26, 2016. The album tracks are said to be the result of multiple improvised jam sessions. The album also features guest appearances from artists such as [[Damon Albarn]], [[Little Dragon]], [[David Byrne]], [[2 Chainz]] and [[Snoop Dogg]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lanz|first1=Michelle|title=De La Soul previews their new Kickstarter-funded album 'And the Anonymous Nobody'|url=http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/04/06/42253/de-la-soul-previews-their-new-kickstarter-album-an/|website=SCPR|publisher=The Frame|access-date=April 8, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707043716/http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/04/06/42253/de-la-soul-previews-their-new-kickstarter-album-an/|archive-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Tardio|first1=Andres|title=De La Soul Said Their Next Album Will Be Funded Through Kickstarter And Their Fans Went Crazy|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2119889/de-la-soul-kickstarter/|website=MTV|publisher=MTV|access-date=April 9, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404004255/http://www.mtv.com/news/2119889/de-la-soul-kickstarter/|archive-date=April 4, 2015}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Early period ===
De La Soul's debut album, ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'', released in 1989, was a critical smash hit in the hip hop genre. They quickly became prominent members of the [[Native Tongues Posse]] along with [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]], [[Queen Latifah]], the [[Jungle Brothers]] and others. The single "[[Me Myself and I (De La Soul song)|Me Myself and I]]" became a huge hit, further cementing the group's popularity. However, the sixties pop group [[The Turtles]] sued De La Soul for using a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from their 1969 hit "[[You Showed Me]]" for the interlude track "Transmitting Live from Mars", despite the fact that The Turtles did not actually write the original song.<ref>{{cite web|title=You Showed Me: The Turtles|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/t2052310|website=AllMusic|access-date=April 3, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424163510/http://www.allmusic.com/song/t2052310|archive-date=April 24, 2011}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=March 2018}}

Lyrically, much of ''3 Feet High and Rising'' focused on striving for peace and harmony. ''3 Feet High and Rising'' also introduced De La Soul's concept of the "D.A.I.S.Y. Age" (an acronym standing for "da inner sound, y'all"). As a result, audiences were quick to peg the members of De La Soul as [[hippie]]s. This stereotype greatly agitated the group's members, as they always envisioned their career as a constantly changing style; this frustration would influence their next recording sessions. In the [[press kit]] for ''3 Feet High and Rising'', the members explained their [[pseudonym|stage names]]: Trugoy when reversed spells yogurt, because he likes yogurt, and Posdnuos spelled backwards is "sound sop". The album artwork was designed by radical British artist collective the [[Grey Organisation]].<ref>[http://www.complex.com/art-design/2010/09/Hip-Hops-50-Greatest-Album-Covers/de-la-soul-2] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927045246/http://www.complex.com/art-design/2010/09/Hip-Hops-50-Greatest-Album-Covers/de-la-soul-2 |date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>

[[File:Run Run Run (2720461334).jpg|thumb|right|Performing in 1991 at the [[Dillon Gymnasium]]]]
De La Soul's second album, ''[[De La Soul Is Dead]]'' (1991) was a much more mature album. It featured a wealth of material that criticized the violent, careless direction that hip hop was heading in at the time, though it still managed to maintain a light, absurd sense of humor. The cover of the album features a broken daisy flower pot, symbolizing the death of the "D.A.I.S.Y. Age" and the imagery that went along with it. The album spawned several singles, including the dark "[[Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa/Keepin' the Faith|Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa]]", a tale of a young girl who could no longer take the sexual abuse from her father, and the lead single "[[Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)]]", a story about the people rated with the [[Black Sheep (group)|Black Sheep]] on "Fanatic of the B Word," [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]] from [[A Tribe Called Quest]] on "[[A Roller Skating Jam Named "Saturdays"|A Roller Skating Jam Named 'Saturdays']]", and [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]] makes an appearance on the mic in "Pass the Plugs" with a verse of his own. The album also more prominently featured [[Vincent Mason]] as a rapper, providing verses of his own on "Bitties in the BK Lounge," "Afro Connections at a Hi-5," and "[[Ring Ring Ring (Ha Ha Hey)]]".

Though it received mixed reviews and did not sell as well as ''[[3 Feet High and Rising]]'' it eventually became a cult classic. ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine listed the album as one of their top 100 hip hop albums of all time, stating that "its true genius is rarely understood" {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. There are several major differences between the CD version of this album and the other formats, as the tracks "Johnny's Dead AKA Vincent Mason", "My Brother's a Basehead", "Kicked Out the House", and "Who Do U Worship?" are only available on the CD. The limited edition double vinyl promotional copies of the album distributed to the media before the official release did not feature these.

=== Middle period ===
The group's third studio release, 1993's ''[[Buhloone Mindstate]]'', saw the group evolve a new sound as they continued to grow stylistically and musically. There were several moments on the album which proved the band had matured. "I Be Blowin'" was a departure as the track was an instrumental featuring saxophone playing by [[Maceo Parker]]. The introspective "I Am I Be" showed De La Soul at their most self-referential to date with subject matter about Pos' daughter Ayana Monet as well as his grandmother. "Long Island Wildin'" was a collaboration with Japanese hip hop artists Kan Takagi (Major Force) and trio Scha Dara Parr (SDP). The album's first single, "[[Breakadawn]]", used a sample of Michael Jackson's "I Can't Help It" and Smokey Robinson's "Quiet Storm". De La Soul collaborated for the first time with [[Gang Starr]]'s [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] on "Patti Dooke", female MC [[Shortie No Mas]], a cousin of Posdnuos, was prominent on many tracks on the album, showcased particularly "In The Woods". The album ended with an old school [[Biz Markie]] collaboration called "Stone Age". Missing from vocal duties is Mase, whose voice can only be heard on "Area" in a break near the end of the track. Also rarely featured is his scratching which was heard often on previous albums, with only "In the Woods" showcasing his talent in that area. The album was a critical success, but it was the biggest commercial failure for the group at the time of its release. Many publications, such as ''Rolling Stone'', have listed this album as one of the best hip hop albums of all time.

In 1994, 500 copies of a promotional [[Extended play|EP]] called ''[[Clear Lake Audiotorium (EP)|Clear Lake Audiotorium]]'' were released on clear vinyl and CD. The 6 track EP contained edited versions of tracks off of ''Buhloone Mindstate'' but also featured the tracks "Sh.Fe.MC's" (Shocking Female MC's) which was a collaboration with A Tribe Called Quest, and Stix & Stonz which featured old-school hip hop artists Grandmaster Caz, Tito of Fearless Four, Whipper Whip, LA Sunshine and Superstar. The EP was widely bootlegged afterwards.

''[[Stakes Is High]]'' (1996) was the first album not produced by [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], with overall production credits given solely to the trio. Although it was met with poor sales, it has been critically lauded for its music, lyricism, and its overall message concerning the artistic decline rap music began to face in the mid-90s. The [[Stakes Is High (song)|title track and first single]], produced by [[J Dilla]], was not a hit, but the album's second single, "[[Itzsoweezee (HOT)]]", with only Dave on vocals, did fare better due to its creative music video. The album spawned a third single "[[4 More]]", featuring [[Zhane]] which peaked at #52 in the UK. The album did provide a launching pad for future star rapper and actor [[Mos Def]], who appeared on the track "Big Brother Beat". The album also featured collaborations with [[Common (rapper)|Common]], Truth Enola, and the [[Jazzyfatnastees]].

=== Later period ===
[[File:DeLa Soul-mika.jpg|thumb|De La Soul in 2002]]
Four years later, De La Soul announced that they would release a triple album series entitled "Art Official Intelligence" (or AOI). All three albums were intended to be released within a year, beginning with the release of ''[[Art Official Intelligence: Mosaic Thump]]''. This was followed by ''[[AOI: Bionix]]'' in late 2001. After this, however, the third and final album in the AOI series was never released. For the next two years, the only De La Soul releases were singles or remix compilations. David Jude Jolicoeur stated in an interview that it usually takes about four years for the group to record an album, promote it with advertisements, touring and so on. The group was having trouble finishing the last AOI installment for many reasons, one of which being an ongoing struggle with [[Tommy Boy Records]],{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} which had been releasing its albums ever since its debut.

In the summer of 2002, De La Soul toured with [[Cake (band)|Cake]], [[Modest Mouse]], [[The Flaming Lips]], [[Kinky (band)|Kinky]], and the [[Hackensaw Boys]] during the Unlimited Sunshine Tour. The band was briefly featured in the video game ''[[PaRappa the Rapper 2]]'' with the song "[[Say "I Gotta Believe!"]]", featuring [[Double (singer)|Double]], and also appeared on the soundtrack of the game.

In 2004, De La Soul released a new full album: ''[[The Grind Date]]'' on Sanctuary/BMG Records because the venture between Tommy Boy and Warner Bros. Records was shut down and the group's contract was shopped to the other [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] labels. The band thought about having its contract absorbed by [[Elektra Records]], but it decided to leave WEA altogether. Although it was not the third AOI album fans had been expecting, the album was released to some critical acclaim and was well received by most fans. The album features guests [[MF Doom]], [[Ghostface Killah]], Butta Verses and [[Flavor Flav]], with production from [[9th Wonder]], [[Jake One]], [[Madlib]] and more. The lead single "[[Shopping Bags (She Got from You)]]" did not fare very well and set the tone for disappointing commercial acceptance. In conjunction with the album's release, the group also offered up the track "Come on Down" featuring Flavor Flav for remixing on Sony's Acid Planet website. The winning remix was "Come On Down (KY Raised NY Glazed)" by Interlude Jones who said he tried to "take the influential sound of old New York hip hop and marry it back to its roots."

=== Since ''The Grind Date'' ===
In 2005, De La Soul collaborated with [[Gorillaz]] on the hit single "[[Feel Good Inc.]]," which won a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Vocal Collaboration]] (the first Grammy win in the group's career) after being nominated for a total of three Grammys.<ref name="grammywin" /><ref name="threenoms">{{cite web|url=http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2005/Press35.htm |title=EMI Music earns 54 Grammy nominations |access-date=February 6, 2009 |date=December 8, 2005 |publisher=[[EMI]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081114093014/http://www.emigroup.com/Press/2005/Press35.htm |archive-date=November 14, 2008 }}</ref> De La Soul also appeared on the [[LA Symphony]] single "Universal" and Posdnuos collaborated with the Portuguese MC [[Boss AC]] on a track called "''Yo (Não Brinques Com Esta Merda)''". The following year they released mixtapes ''Hip-Hop Mixtape'', a [[covermount]] with British dance magazine ''[[Mixmag]]'', and ''[[The Impossible: Mission TV Series – Pt. 1]]'', a release on the group's own AOI Records label.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2006_11_impossibletv.html |title=De La Soul :: Impossible Mission TV Series Pt. 1 |publisher=Rapreviews.com |date=November 7, 2006 |access-date=April 3, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316200223/http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2006_11_impossibletv.html |archive-date=March 16, 2012 }}</ref> De La Soul collaborated with the athletic sneaker company [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] to produce two versions of the [[Nike Dunk]] under their skateboarding division, [[Nike SB]]. [[File:De La Soul at Marsatac 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Posdnuos of De La Soul performing at the Marsatac Festival in 2008]]
In 2008, the group joined [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Nas]], [[Tech N9ne]], [[The Pharcyde]] and others on the annual [[Rock the Bells]] tour<ref>[http://www.musicpix.net/modules.php?op=modload&name=News&file=article&sid=1029 ": Rock The Bells 2008 Line-Up Announced – Tour Schedule"], musicpix.net</ref> and were honored at the 5th Annual [[VH1 Hip Hop Honors]]. Later in the year they collaborated with [[dan le sac vs Scroobius Pip]] on a re-recording of the British group's debut single "[[Thou Shalt Always Kill]]."

De La Soul returned as a guest on the third [[Gorillaz]] studio album, ''[[Plastic Beach]]'' alongside [[Super Furry Animals]] frontman [[Gruff Rhys]] on the song "[[Superfast Jellyfish]]". Two other collaborations were recorded, but did not make the final cut for the album. They were supposed to appear on a track entitled "Sloped Tropics", though this song did not make the final cut. The group remixed indie rockers [[Yo La Tengo]]'s single, ''"Here To Fall for the Here To Fall"'' remixes EP which included remixes by [[RJD2]] and [[Pete Rock]], and were featured on a remix of [[Matt & Kim]]'s single "Daylight" by DJ Troublemaker.

In 2011, the group earned Top 5 rankings on both [[NPR]] and [[Soul Train]]'s year end "Best of" lists with the [[Amerigo Gazaway]] produced De La Soul/Fela Kuti mashup, ''Fela Soul''. De La Soul and [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] released ''[[Are You In?: Nike+ Original Run]]'', which was the group's first original material since ''[[The Impossible: Mission TV Series – Pt. 1]]''. The album features [[Raheem DeVaughn]] as well as production from the Chicago-based duo Flosstradamus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://hypebeast.com/2009/04/nike-and-de-la-soul-present-are-you-in-original-run-album/ |title=Nike & De La Soul present ARE YOU IN?

The group released ''De La Soul's Plug 1 & Plug 2 presents... First Serve'' in April 2012, an album that did not feature any contributions from Maseo. With very little promotion, the album was released to positive reviews. This was followed by releasing one track a month during 2013.

In March 2015, De La Soul created a [[Kickstarter]] to help fund their upcoming album. It surpassed the original goal of $110,000 in under ten hours.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album|title=De La Soul's NEW ALBUM|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402134806/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1519102394/de-la-souls-new-album|archive-date=April 2, 2015}}</ref> The resulting album, ''[[And the Anonymous Nobody]]'', was released in August 2016.

== Catalog dispute ==
De La Soul's back catalog has not been released on [[audio streaming]] services or [[digital media]] stores. Until 2017, it was owned by [[Warner Records]], which, according to Posdnuos, had been reluctant to clear samples and renegotiate contracts.
