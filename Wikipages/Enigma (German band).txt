'''Enigma''' is a German musical project founded in 1990 by Romanian-German musician and producer [[Michael Cretu]].<ref name="Billboard: Casebook Enigma">{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gsEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA58 |title=Billboard: Casebook Enigma|work=[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]|last=Weinert|first=Ellie|date=1995-03-04|access-date=2013-08-24}}</ref> Cretu had released several solo records, collaborated with various artists, and produced albums for his then-wife, German pop singer [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra]], before he conceived the idea of a [[New-age music|new-age]], [[worldbeat]] project. He recorded the first Enigma studio album, ''[[MCMXC a.D.]]'' (1990), with contributions from David Fairstein and [[Frank Peterson]]. The album remains Enigma's biggest, helped by the international hit single, "[[Sadeness (Part I)]]", which sold 12 million units alone.<ref>Burton, Tony. [http://mfblogg.no/6195/ "Sadeness, Part 1 Review on MFBlogg.no"]. Retrieved 25 August 2016.</ref> According to Cretu, the inspiration for the creation of the project came from his desire to make a kind of music that did not obey "the old rules and habits" and presented a new form of artistic expression with mystic and experimental components.<ref>Willin, Melvyn J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yUTTs0HIJTUC&pg=PA252 "Enigma on ''Music, Witchcraft and the Paranormal'']. Retrieved 25 August 2016.</ref>

Enigma followed ''[[MCMXC a.D.]]'' with a series of albums that involved several musicians and producers working with Cretu. The first was ''[[The Cross of Changes]]'' (1993), which incorporated tribal and ethnic influences and sold over 8 million copies worldwide,<ref name=cross>[http://www.udiscovermusic.com/rediscover-enigma-2-the-cross-of-changes "''The Cross of Changes'' on UDiscoverMusic"]. Retrieved on 25 August 2016.</ref> followed by ''[[Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!]]'' (1996), which blended the [[Gregorian chant]]s reminiscent of the first album with the strong intercultural soundscapes present in the second. Enigma's fourth album ''[[The Screen Behind the Mirror]]'' (2000) started a slight departure from the previous [[world music]] themes towards a heavier electronic atmosphere. This evolution culminated with ''[[Voyageur (Enigma album)|Voyageur]]'' (2003), its fifth and more pop-based album, and ''[[A Posteriori]]'' (2006), a work inspired by the future [[Andromeda–Milky Way collision|collision between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies]], with distinct operatic tones and an electronic spectrum closer to ''Voyageur'' than the earlier releases.<ref>Cinquemani, Sal.

==History==

===Formation (1988–1990)===
By the late 1980s, [[Romania]]n-born [[Germany|German]] musician and producer [[Michael Cretu]] had collaborated with several musicians, produced albums recorded by his then-wife, German pop singer [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra]], and released solo albums under his name for [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] and [[Virgin Records]], to varying levels of commercial success across Europe. In 1988, Cretu and Sandra married and relocated to the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]]. A home recording studio, [[A.R.T. Studios]], was built, and Cretu began work on a new, [[worldbeat]] and [[New-age music|new age]] musical project named Enigma with David Fairstein and [[Frank Peterson]]. Cretu secured a deal with [[Munich]]-based Mambo Musik to handle Enigma's management and publishing.<ref name=billboard1996/>

===''MCMXC a.D.'' and ''The Cross of Changes'' (1990–1995)===
The first Enigma album, ''[[MCMXC a.D.]]'', was recorded in eight months and incorporated [[Gregorian chant]]s mixed with atmospheric music and dance beats. He had previously used a Gregorian-type chant on the opening seconds of Sandra's 1987 single "[[Everlasting Love]]". Cretu wished to exclude his name from the album's [[liner notes]] so the listener could conjure their own interpretations. He recalled management "fell off their chairs" when he requested it, "but it worked".<ref name=billboard1996>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ugkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA95|title=Virgin Stays With Proven Marketing for Enigma|first=Dominic|last=Pride|date=23 November 1996|journal=Billboard|pages=1, 95|access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref> Cretu credits himself as "Curly M.C." and Peterson is listed as "F. Gregorian". Upon its release in December 1990, ''MCMXC a.D.'' became an unexpected commercial success, helped by the international hit single "[[Sadeness (Part I)]]", released a month prior that reached number one in 24 countries.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wBAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA48-IA18|title=A New Generation of German Writers & Producers Makes Marks Over the World|first=Ellie|last=Weinert|date=27 July 1992|journal=Billboard|page=48|access-date=11 August 2016}}</ref> The album reached the top 10 in ten countries, including the United Kingdom, and number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] in the United States, where it sold over four million copies and charted for more than 150 weeks.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/59211/this-day-in-music "''This Day in Music'' on Billboard"].

Following the success of ''MCMXC a.D.'', Cretu received many offers for soundtrack work and writing film scores.<ref name=globe1994/> He turned the majority of them down as he disliked the scripts presented to him except for the erotic thriller film ''[[Sliver (film)|Sliver]]'' (1993), for which he produced two songs for its [[Sliver (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]: "[[Carly's Song]]" and "Carly's Loneliness".<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/sliver-mw0000099234/credits "''Silver'' Soundtrack on AllMusic"]. Retrieved on 25 August 2016.</ref> The former track appeared as a new version on the second Enigma album ''[[The Cross of Changes]]'' as "[[Age of Loneliness]]". Cretu was unable to contribute more to the soundtrack as he wished to spend his time working on the album.<ref name=globe1994/>

''The Cross of Changes'' was recorded in 1993 at A.R.T. Studios. Cretu retained many of the elements from the first album, but "wanted to have a completely different experience. I wanted to mix as much as possible rock elements and ethnic and classical". Numerous samples were used, including from songs by [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Vangelis]], and [[U2]]. Cretu made a conscious effort to reduce the amount of Gregorian chants incorporated into the album.<ref name=globe1994/> Cretu based much of its lyrics on the concepts behind [[numerology]], and read books on the subject.<ref name=globe1994/> ''The Cross of Changes'' was released in December 1993, and reached number one in the UK and number 9 in the US. Four singles were released in 1994: "[[Return to Innocence]]", "[[The Eyes of Truth]]", "Age of Loneliness", and "[[Out from the Deep]]". The former became an international top-10 hit in 12 countries and is certified gold in the US for selling half a million copies. ''The Cross of Changes'' sold an estimated 8 million copies worldwide.

===''Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!'' and ''The Screen Behind the Mirror'' (1996–2002)===
In 1996, ''[[Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!]]'' (French for "The King is Dead, Long Live the King!") was released. Cretu's idea was that this third album was the child of the previous two albums, and therefore included familiar elements of Gregorian chants and [[Sanskrit]] chants in it. It did not achieve the same level of success that they enjoyed previously, and as a result, only two of the three singles originally slated were released. ''Le Roi est mort, Vive le Roi!'' sold over one million units in the United States, achieved a Gold certificate in the United Kingdom and two Grammy nominations: one for its artwork design and the second as Best New Age Album.<ref>[http://www.udiscovermusic.com/rediscover-le-roi-est-mort-vive-le-roi "''Le Roi est Mort, Vive le Roi!'' on UDiscoverMusic]. Retrieved on 25 August 2016.</ref> After the album's release, Cretu found that several fake Enigma albums were released onto the market that Cretu deemed as "awful messes".<ref name=times2001>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,146-2001371732,00.html|title=How to be an Enigma|date=26 October 2001|first=John|last=Bungey|newspaper=The Times|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011026191404/http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/0,,146-2001371732,00.html|archive-date=26 October 2001|access-date=18 February 2017}}</ref>

The 2000 release of ''[[The Screen Behind the Mirror]]'' included samples from [[Carl Orff]]'s ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]'' on four tracks on the album. This time the Gregorian chants were toned down tremendously, although [[Shakuhachi]] flutes and other traditional Enigma signatures remain. Only "[[Gravity of Love]]" and "[[Push the Limits]]" were released as singles from the album.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-screen-behind-the-mirror-mw0000670919 "''The Screen Behind the Mirror'' on AllMusic"].

In 2001, Cretu released a new single called "[[Turn Around (Enigma song)|Turn Around]]" together with ''[[Love Sensuality Devotion: The Greatest Hits]]'' and ''[[Love Sensuality Devotion: The Remix Collection]]'' to end what he considers to be the first chapter of Enigma. A [[Laser lighting display|light show]] was held at the Munich Planetarium in conjunction with the release of the compilation albums.<ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/album/lsd-love-sensuality-and-devotion-mw0000591030 "''Love Sensuality Devotion'' on AllMusic"].

To commemorate the fifteen years of Enigma, a limited-edition album called [[15 Years After]] was launched, which was the size of an [[LP album|LP]] [[phonograph|vinyl disk]], with [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s art in the cover, a big booklet with extra art, and featured eight compact discs: all the previous albums, the [[DVD]] ''Remember the Future'', and a special and exclusive bonus [[compact disc|CD]], ''The Dusted Variations'', which included Chill-out versions of several of the project's greatest hits.

On 26 September 2006, Enigma's sixth album ''[[A posteriori (album)|A Posteriori]]'' was released worldwide, containing a new version of "Hello and Welcome" and the new song "Goodbye, [[Milky Way]]".  A DVD version of ''A Posteriori'' was released on 16 December 2006, which featured [[kaleidoscope]] images in synchronization with the multi-channel remastered music. ''A Posteriori'' received a Grammy nomination as Best New Age Album, its second in that category following 1996's ''[[Le Roi Est Mort, Vive Le Roi!]]'' nomination.<ref>[https://www.librarything.com/bookaward/49th+Annual+Grammy+Awards+Nominee "49th Annual Grammy Nominees"].

Some of these tracks were available previously on the original ''A Posteriori'' iTunes version of the album and the previously mentioned DVD release.

On 19 September 2008, Enigma's seventh album ''[[Seven Lives Many Faces]]'' was released worldwide. The lead single, "[[La Puerta del Cielo / Seven Lives|Seven Lives]]", is a fusion of modern and classical elements.

''[[The Platinum Collection (Enigma album)|The Platinum Collection]]'', a 3-CD compilation, was released on 27 November 2009 in Germany, and on 9 February 2010 worldwide.

==Recording technologies==
Cretu recorded the first five Enigma albums at [[A.R.T. Studios]], a home recording studio located on the Spanish island of [[Ibiza]]. From 1988 until 2001, Cretu lived in [[Santa Eulària des Riu]] followed by, from 2001 to 2008, a villa near [[Sant Antoni]] where the studio was redesigned and built by Gunter Wagner and Bernd Steber. ''[[Voyageur (Enigma album)|Voyageur]]'' and ''[[A Posteriori]]'' were recorded using an all-in-one mobile digital recording studio named Alchemist.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enigmaspace.com/Alchemist.93.0.html |title=Enigma &#124; Official Site - A.R.T. // Alchemist // All In One Mobile Studio |website=Enigmaspace.com |access-date=2012-03-07}}</ref> In 2010, a reworked version of Alchemist was built and named Merlin.

==Sampling and lawsuits==
In 1991, Cretu was sued by [[Munich]]-based choir Capella Antiqua and its record label [[Polydor]] Germany for infringing its "right of personality" through distortion in the [[sampling (music)|samples]] used in "[[Sadeness (Part I)]]" and "[[Mea Culpa (Part II)]]". The samples were taken from Capella Antiqua's 1976 LP ''[[Paschale Mysterium]]''; while the musical compositions were in the public domain, Capella Antiqua's recording of them was [[copyright]]ed. European law also recognizes moral rights (''[[Moral rights (copyright law)|droit moral]]'') in works.<ref name="billboard1991-lawsuit">{{Cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/details/sim_billboard_1991-09-14_103_37/page/80/mode/2up|magazine=Billboard|title='Sadeness' Creator Settles Sample Suit; Will Compensate For Unauthorised Usage|date=14 September 1991|volume=103|issue=37|page=80|first=Ellie|last=Weinert|access-date=10 October 2020}}</ref><ref>Taylor, Timothy Dean.

==Legacy==
Enigma's international success with ''[[MCMXC a.D.]]'' was a precursor to the creation of several other musical projects that follow similar styles and marketing approaches, especially the use of the term "project" as opposed to the band to denominate themselves, and the label "enigmatic music", employed mainly by radios and listeners, to categorize their music inside the [[New-age music|New Age]] umbrella.<ref name = Brands>[https://books.google.com/books?id=DwoEAAAAMBAJ&pg=RA1-PA101&dq#v=onepage&q&f=false “''Some European Acts Being Marketed as ‘Brands’ Instead of Faces''”]. [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]. 29 August  1998. Retrieved 14 October 2016.</ref> Cretu has cited the [[progressive rock]] band [[Yes (band)|Yes]] as an influence.<ref name=globe1994>{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8270996.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219020033/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8270996.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 February 2017|title=Michael Cretu: Enigma's musical alchemist|date=18 March 1994|first=Jim|last=Sullivan|newspaper=The Boston Globe|access-date=18 February 2017}}</ref>

Soon after working with Michael Cretu on the first Enigma album, German producer [[Frank Peterson]] left the project to focus on [[Gregorian (band)|Gregorian]], a band that performs mostly covers of modern pop and rock songs with [[Gregorian chant|Gregorian]]-like vocals and symphonic instruments.<ref>[http://www.classical-crossover.co.uk/artprofiles/223-gregorian.html "''Gregorian'' on Classical-Crossover.co.uk."]. Classical-Crossover.co.uk.
