'''Blue Stahli''' is an American multi-genre (predominantly [[electronic rock]]) project based in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] that was created by Bret Autrey. Blue Stahli has appeared in a number of movie trailers, shows and games.<ref name="Movie & TV Credits - IMDb">{{cite web |last=Autrey |first=Bret |title=Bret Autrey - IMDb |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm9075344/ |work=IMDb |publisher=IMDb |access-date=November 26, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Movie & TV Credits - Blue Stahli">{{cite web |last=Autrey |first=Bret |title=Film/TV Credits - Blue Stahli |url=http://www.bluestahli.com/site/filmtv-credits |publisher=FiXT |access-date=November 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201032011/http://www.bluestahli.com/site/filmtv-credits |archive-date=December 1, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
===Musical beginnings and VOXiS (1997–2006)===
Bret started music at a young age, learning through the use of an old beat up [[piano]] he had rescued from a dump. He worked through 3 years of piano lessons, by mimicking his neighbor and playing the melodies by ear. During this same time, he had become interested in sampling and programming music using [[DOS]]'s [[Impulse Tracker]]. Later he received lessons from a friend for [[guitar]], and would play along to music such as Queen's soundtrack to ''Flash Gordon''. He has played in a band as the guitarist, fronted by drag queens; as well as joining a burlesque troupe as a DJ to their shows.<!--During his time in the burlesque troupe, he had written some demos for Blue Stahli which initially started out as more of a guitar driven, personal outlet.(not sure if I should add this)--><ref name="Interview with Blue Stahli">{{cite web |last=Brenton |first=Ryan |title=FiXT Interview: Blue Stahli |url=http://fixtstore.com/news/?p=2778 |work=Fixtstore.com |publisher=FiXT |access-date=November 27, 2017 |format=Interview |date=March 8, 2011  |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118193955/http://fixtstore.com/news/?p=2778 |archive-date=January 18, 2014 }}</ref>

Bret used his self-taught musical skills<ref name="Autrey talks about where he gained his musical talent">{{cite web |last=Autrey |first=Bret |title=Ask Blue Stahli - Naked Elvis Kung Fu |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd15HhJSRqk |work=YouTube |publisher=Blue Stahli |access-date=January 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512014948/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wd15HhJSRqk |archive-date=2016-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref> alongside Collin Landis to enter a demo-tape titled Mainframe into Flaming Fish Music. Once on the label the duo, aided by brother of Collin, Shawn Lanis (Virocity) produced (under VOXiS:MACHINA, and later VOXiS) Lullabies in 1998. Later in 2006, released as VOXiS, was the debut album Darkeworld: Project One. The release was aimed for summer 2001,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.facebook.com/groups/8796587562?view=permalink&id=10156242199282563|title=Facebook Group|website=Facebook|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> but complications pushed the album back 5 years. Darkeworld features various collections of songs, demos, and experiments through the years 2000 to 2006, being re-released through FiXT in 2007 prior to his signing on as Blue Stahli.<ref name="About the 'Darkeworld Project One' album">{{cite web |title=VOXiS - Darkeworld Project One |url=http://www.fixtstore.com/product/8888/Voxis---Darkeworld-Project-One-%28MP3-Album%29 |work=FiXT Music |publisher=FiXT Music |access-date=January 23, 2014 |format=Online store |year=2007 |quote=The material on this disc is a non-chronological collection of songs, demos, experiments and crimes against the listening populace I committed between the years 2000 and 2006. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116192527/http://www.fixtstore.com/product/8888/Voxis---Darkeworld-Project-One-%28MP3-Album%29 |archive-date=2014-01-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Interview with Blue Stahli"/>

[[Klayton]] (of [[Celldweller]]; co-founder of the FiXT Music label) discovered Blue Stahli in 2007 through a remix contest for "[[Own Little World]]", titled as the "Remorse Code remix". After he was signed he relocated to [[Detroit]], the residence of the FiXT Music label and its studios.<ref name="About the 'Darkeworld Project One' album"/>

On May 20, 2013, Blue Stahli released a stand-alone single titled "Never Dance Again", which featured elements of 80s Dance music, followed by a remix by labelmate Josh Money.<ref name="Blue Stahli releases Never Dance Again">{{cite web |last=Maguire |first=Chris |title=Blue Stahli Releases '80s Indie Chainsaw Pop' Single: "Never Dance Again" |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/159029-blue-stahli-releases-80s-indie-chainsaw-pop.html |work=Altsounds.com |publisher=AltSounds |access-date=January 23, 2014 |format=News post |date=May 20, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201225115/http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/159029-blue-stahli-releases-80s-indie-chainsaw-pop.html |archive-date=February 1, 2014 }}</ref> In July the same year, Stahli started a [[YouTube]] series titled ''Ask Blue Stahli'', a [[vlogging]] series where fans can ask him questions on his social sites using the [[hashtag]] #askbluestahli for him to answer.<ref name="First video of the 'Ask Blue Stahli' series">{{cite web |title=Ask Blue Stahli - Clownhorning |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oeU5Vyy-jM&index=2&list=PLVCQmfQyFfPtfM_7Bl4my2-AbmhkesBAf |work=YouTube.com |publisher=Blue Stahli |access-date=January 23, 2014 |format=YouTube video |date=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626064753/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oeU5Vyy-jM&index=2&list=PLVCQmfQyFfPtfM_7Bl4my2-AbmhkesBAf |archive-date=2014-06-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first song ever officially recorded for Blue Stahli was This Will Make You Love Again, a cover of IAMX. Of the song, Bret tells that it was recorded "in a closet in a family home."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bluestahli/status/1142482474389295104?s=21|title=So glad you enjoy it! That cover was done ages ago, and recorded in a closet in a family home that is unfortunately not in the family anymore, so it holds a special place besides just loving @IAMX|last=Stahli|first=Blue|date=2019-06-22|website=@bluestahli|language=en|access-date=2019-11-23}}</ref> It was recorded the night before he left Phoenix, Arizona, to Detroit, Michigan, to begin the Blue Stahli project.<ref>{{Citation|title=This Will Make You Love Again (SAB D1T20)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odu3IaR1cmE|language=en|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref> Autrey also states that it was singing along to early IAMX records that taught him how to sing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYKoJsNTQKY&list=PLhvEr7FMy5a0XGmL2y_4WWOgcIJlKR96q&index=56&t=0s|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com|access-date=2019-11-25}}</ref>

It could be argued, however, that the first Blue Stahli track is a 2004 demo featuring Rob Buhl of (Torn Skin and Syntax Error) titled 'Untitled Demo 2004' and 'We Haven't Name This Track Yet.' The song was originally slated for one of Rob Buhl's projects, but never got used and was later naturalized as a Blue Stahli track in 2014 on B-Sides And Other Things I Forgot (though it has since been removed).<ref>{{Citation|title=We Haven't Name This Song Yet [Blue Stahli ft.

''The Devil'' was released on October 2, 2015.

===''Sunset Neon'' and ''Obsidian'' (2017–2020)===
Since April 2017, Blue Stahli has been working under the alias '''Sunset Neon''', a predominantly [[synthwave]] solo project. He released his debut album ''Starlight'' on December 1, 2017.<ref>https://sunsetneon.bandcamp.com/album/starlight</ref> On September 13, 2018, the single "Lakes of Flame" was released for the would-be seventh album, ''Obsidian''.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Zukowski |first1=Zenae |title=Blue Stahli premiere new song "Lakes of Flame" |url=https://www.metalinsider.net/new-music/blue-stahli-premiere-new-song-lakes-of-flame |publisher=Metal Insider |date=September 13, 2018}}</ref> ''Obsidian'' was originally slated for a 2019 release with "Lakes of Flame" as the lead single, but due to legality and personal issues with FiXT Music and its owner, it never came to fruition and was later moved to 2021, with "Lakes of Flame" becoming a non-album single.

=== The deadchannel_Trilogy (2020–present) ===
By the end of September, Blue Stahli posted three teasers for a trilogy of albums called the Dead Channel Trilogy (stylized as deadchannel_Trilogy). The first two were revealed to be titled ''Quartz'' and ''Copper'' while also confirming ''Obsidian'' to be the final album of the trilogy.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 15, 2020|title=deadchannel_01|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=xY2ypeqcfLQ|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=September 22, 2020|title=deadchannel_02|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=FfnkOSjFlkk|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=September 29, 2020|title=deadchannel_03|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=sxMHgRm97Fs|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> The albums were released on October 2, November 13, 2020 and January 15, 2021 respectively; the first independent releases in Blue Stahli's history.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Parsons|first=Luke|date=October 11, 2020|title=Blue Stahli - Quartz (Album Review)|url=https://abrasivenoise.com/blue-stahli-quartz-album-review/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 24, 2021|website=Abrasive Noise|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Parsons|first=Luke|date=November 18, 2020|title=Blue Stahli - Copper (Album Review)|url=https://abrasivenoise.com/blue-stahli-copper-album-review/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 24, 2021|website=Abrasive Noise|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Parsons|first=Luke|date=January 20, 2021|title=Blue Stahli - Obsidian (Album Review) + dead_Channel trilogy round-up|url=https://abrasivenoise.com/blue-stahli-obsidian-album-review-dead_channel-trilogy-round-up/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=January 24, 2021|website=Abrasive Noise|language=en-US}}</ref>
