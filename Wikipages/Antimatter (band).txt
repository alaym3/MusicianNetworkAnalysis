'''Antimatter''', a UK dark rock band, is the solo project of longtime founding member [[Mick Moss]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://dictionary.cambridge.org/example/english/founding-member |title=Examples of founding member |last= |first= |date= |website= Cambridge Dictionary|publisher= |access-date= |quote=Meaning of founding member in English. one of the original members of an organization or rock group}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/artist/230169-Antimatter-3|title= Antimatter|last= |first= |date= |website= Discogs|publisher= |access-date= |quote= Antimatter has been a solo project of Moss, who continues to release albums and plays live in different settings}}</ref> The project was originally a duo composed of founding member [[Duncan Patterson]] (former bassist/songwriter of [[Anathema (band)|Anathema]]) and Moss, being essentially an amalgamation of two solo projects working in tandem with each other, with each member writing and arranging their songs alone and compiling them in the studio later on to create an album.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.theinarguable.com/2010/10/interview-with-duncan-patterson.html |title= Interview with Duncan Patterson

Describing Antimatter's sound for an article in The Krakow Post in 2016, late U.S. journalist Dewey Gurall said "while the early albums had more of a triphop vibe with lots of female vocals (think Portishead or Zero 7), nowadays that type of electronic ambience and rhythm are more integrated with art rock, prog, metal, folk, shoegazer, a dash of classic British pop, and even grunge, all while never wandering too far from that darkwave sensibility mentioned earlier. The lead vocals are handled completely, and masterfully, by Mick.
On paper, the mix of different genre might sound like it wouldn’t work, maybe even like a bit of a mess. Instead, from so many different elements, Moss has constructed something both wholly original and emotionally moving".<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.krakowpost.com/12665/2016/06/darkwave-poland-antimatter-tranquilizer-nonamen|title= Darkwave in Poland

==History==

===Pre-History and Formation (1998–99)===
[[File:Antimatter_Logo.jpg|thumb|left|The logo for Antimatter has been used on every release since the debut album 'Saviour' in 2001.]][[File:Antimatter2000.jpg|thumb|right|The original line-up of the duo Antimatter, LTR Mick Moss, Duncan Patterson]]
Without hearing each other's latest recordings, in 1998 Duncan Patterson and Mick Moss had both reached the same place musically and philosophically. Patterson had just finished recording Anathema's 'Alternative 4' album and Moss had been working on a set of demos. The similarities were striking. Moss had produced 'Saviour', 'Over Your Shoulder' and 'Angelic', which drew parallels directly to Patterson's 'Empty', 'Feel' and 'Destiny'. Both sets of recordings were dark, melodic and minimal, lyrically dealing with a discomfort with oneself and others. Patterson at the time had grown restless with Anathema, and upon hearing Moss’ demos suggested they record together. Patterson quit Anathema in 1998 and re-recorded Moss’ 3 tracks as a demo to pass to labels, under the moniker of ‘Angelica’. The demo was originally rejected by Peaceville Records as being too melodic and not leaning enough towards heavy metal. Patterson later penned and recorded a 4th track, ‘Holocaust’, for the demo. In 1999, Australian band Cryptal Darkness contacted Patterson, and during a later conversation a member of CD (who also ran the group's label) asked Patterson what he had been involved with since leaving Anathema. Patterson mailed a cassette of the demo off, and upon hearing it the label agreed to release the duo's first album.

===Saviour (2000–02)===

Signed to [[Icon Records]], in September 2000 they entered Academy Studios, Dewsbury, as Antimatter to record their debut album ''[[Saviour (album)|Saviour]]''. Patterson contributes the tracks "Holocaust", "God Is Coming", "Flowers" and "Going Nowhere", while Moss brings "Saviour", "Over Your Shoulder", "Psalms", "Angelic" and "The Last Laugh". Although Moss performed vocals on his original demos, Patterson has the idea to have mainly female vocals, performed by Michelle Richfield and Hayley Windsor. Moss performs vocals on two tracks only. Instrumentation is split between Patterson and Moss.

In 2001, the album and band received "Album of the Year" and "Best Newcomer of the Year" in ''[[Psycho!]]'' magazine. Unfortunately, Antimatter's record label distributed only a small number of copies despite demand for much more, and it soon became apparent that the label wasn't able to manufacture and distribute copies of the album in reasonable numbers. Thus began a 12-month battle between act and label, with Icon Records holding onto the rights of ''Saviour'' despite being unable to release it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://grimparacelse.free.fr/Interviews/antimatter(duncan).html |title=Interview with Duncan Patterson |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Grimparacelse |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Shortly afterwards, with Icon Records not having fulfilled their obligations regarding the distribution of the album, we found ourselves in a very frustrating position.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://grimparacelse.free.fr/Interviews/antimatter(duncan).html |title=Interview with Duncan Patterson |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Grimparacelse  |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Icon Records was not really a label. He was just a guy that I had some confidence in to begin with but he didn't have the basics required to release an album. I tried to help him and give him some advice but he never admitted there was a problem so it was a very frustrating time. After months and months of disagreements, we finally got the rights to the album back and I got licenses with The End Records and Prophecy Productions. At the same time, I also created my own label Strangelight Records.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://grimparacelse.free.fr/Interviews/antimatter(mick).html|title=Interview with Mick Moss |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Grimparacelse |publisher= |access-date= |quote=The problems started on the very first release date, it was in Holland in May 2001 I believe, and we were there at the time. We looked in a few major record stores and couldn't find anything. Dunc asked a salesperson who searched on his computer, and he told us there was no entry at all for it. It was the same for the other release dates and countries. Duncan started contacting the distributors who were on this list and none of them knew Icon Records. They basically got the rights to an album that they couldn't release because they had no distributors - they lied about that list. It took over a year to get the rights back}}</ref>

In early 2002 Moss turned down an offer to join a burgeoning Anathema in the vacant bassplayer role for the 'A Natural Disaster' album onward, opting instead to stay with the still struggling Antimatter.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Mick Moss |date= 2017 |title=Leaving Eden Audio Commentary (Redemption) |trans-title= |medium= CD |language= English |url= |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format=|time= |location= |publisher= Prophecy Productions |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=''in 2002 I was spending quite a lot of time with Danny Cavanagh (Anathema), and he phoned me up one afternoon and asked me would I be interested in joining Anathema, and I said no. This was at a time when Anathema were doing bloody well for themselves and Antimatter wasn't, at all. So I turned down the chance to join a big band because my priority was a small band.'' |ref= }}</ref> In March Danny Cavanagh briefly and controversially quit Anathema  with the intention of joining Antimatter, only to re-join Anathema weeks later.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/daniel-cavanagh-leaves-anathema/ |title=DANIEL CAVANAGH Leaves ANATHEMA! |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=24 Mar 2002 |website=Blabbermouth |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Daniel "Danny" Cavanagh has left Britain's ANATHEMA, according to a statement from the guitarist posted at the group's official web site. I have left ANATHEMA for various reasons, the statement from Cavanagh reads. The best reason is because I now play songs with Duncan Patterson and Michael Moss in ANTIMATTER}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/daniel-cavanagh-to-rejoin-anathema/ |title=

I feel the story is incomplete, and as I have been heavily involved since day one, I think I should rest within the band until it reaches its own natural conclusion}}</ref> On July 29 ''Saviour'' finally received a substantial release with [[Prophecy Productions]] in Europe, followed by a North American release from [[The End Records]] on September 24.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-Saviour/release/2910639 |title=Antimatter - Saviour - Prophecy Productions |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Discogs |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-Saviour/release/445333 |title=Antimatter - Saviour - The End Records |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Discogs |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> In October Patterson finances a 5 date Western Europe tour, with Antimatter joined by Danny Cavanagh. Michelle Richfield and Hayley Windsor did not feature in the line-up, with lead vocals being taken by Mick Moss. The debut performance took place at 'The Frontline, Ghent, Belgium on October 4, followed by four more dates in France and Netherlands.<ref name="Livedates">{{cite web |url=https://www.antimatteronline.com/past-dates|title= Past Dates |last= |first= |date= |website=Antimatter Online |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Later that month, Moss published via the internet a free 5-track EP ''A Dream for the Blind'', featuring recordings of himself and Cavanagh rehearsing in Liverpool for that year's debut tour. The release came complete with artwork to be printed off by the public.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-A-Dream-For-The-Blind/release/4173906 |title=Antimatter - A Dream For The Blind |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Discogs|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

===Lights Out and Live@K13 (2003)===

Antimatter entered the studio in January 2003 to record their 2nd album ''[[Lights Out (Antimatter album)|Lights Out]]'', with Moss contributing the tracks "Everything You Know Is Wrong", "The Art of a Soft Landing", "In Stone" and "Dream", while Patterson brings "Lights Out", "Expire", "Reality Clash" and "Terminal".<ref name="LightsOut">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/lights-out-mw0000031814 |title=Antimatter - Lights Out |last= |first= |date= |website= AllMusic|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> The album (recorded during a month is Sun Studios Dublin) marks a shift from its predecessor. Despite the presence of guest vocalists Michelle Richfield and Hayley Windsor, Moss now performs vocals on most of his own tracks and half of Patterson's.<ref name="LightsOut"/> In March, the track "Over Your Shoulder", from the debut album ''Saviour'' is used for soundtrack purposes in MTV's reality TV show ''[[Sorority Life]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lordsofmetalarchive.nl/nl/interviews/view/id/461 |title=Antimatter |last=Gothika |first=Vera |date= |website= Lords Of Metal|publisher= |access-date= |quote=Andreas from The End got in touch and said that MTV had taken up 'Over Your Shoulder' for use on 'Sorority Life', a reality tv show following girls on campus, and that was obviously great news as apparently the last series went out to millions of viewers. A few months later I had another email from him this time saying 'ok ok ! the episode was on tonight and as Over Your Shoulder was playing a girl turns to the camera and says that she is to fulfil her boyfriends fantasy by having sex with another girl for him to watch}}</ref>
In May/June 2003 Antimatter toured the [[West Coast of the United States]] with [[Virgin Black]] and [[Agalloch]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-announce-u-s-dates|title=ANTIMATTER Announce U.S. Dates |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=8 May 2003 |website=Blabbermouth |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Afterwards, Antimatter headed into Europe to perform in Greece and then into Asia, performing in Istanbul, rounding off the tour with an appearance at a festival in Skali, Cyprus.<ref name="Livedates"/>  On June 24, [[Lights Out (Antimatter album)|Lights Out]] is released.<ref name="LightsOut"/> At the same time, Patterson releases the acoustic live album ''[[Live@K13]]'' (recorded during their debut tour in 2002) on his record label [[Strangelight Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-Live-K13/master/214870|title=Antimatter - Live@K13 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Discogs|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> A month later, in July, Antimatter headlined Estonia's annual festival Hard Rock Laager, the country's largest alternative music festival held in the village of Vana-Vigala.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hardrocklaager.ee/ajalugu/ |title=History |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=hardrocklaager |publisher= |access-date= |quote=2003: The  list of bands expanded to 19 names and Antimatter from England were proudly announced as the main performer.}}</ref> In October 2003, Antimatter reconvened to Sun Studios, Dublin, to record a version of [[Dead Can Dance]]’s "Black Sun".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-Tribute-To-Dead-Can-Dance-The-Lotus-Eaters/release/1385040 |title= Tribute To Dead Can Dance: The Lotus Eaters|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Discogs |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> The recording is followed by a tour of Germany with Autumnblaze.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nocturnalhall.com/livereviews/Antimatter/Antimatter2003/antimatter2003_e.htm|title=Antimatter Autumnblaze 2003 |last= Nocturnal |first=Dajana|date=2 Nov 2003|website=Nocturnal Hall |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> In December 2003, Antimatter published onto the internet the album ''Unreleased 98-03'', featuring demos and unheard versions of songs from the first two albums.

===Planetary Confinement and Patterson's departure (2004–05)===

In 2004, Patterson made the decision to quit Antimatter to pursue his solo project 'Ion', but not before contributing to his final album with the band, [[Planetary Confinement]], an album to be recorded in two-halves, one by Moss in England, the other by Patterson in Ireland and France.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-set-title-for-new-album/|title=ANTIMATTER Set Title For New Album |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 21 Oct 2004|website=Blabbermouth |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Duncan and Mick worked separately in their home countries for this release, involving local musicians.}}</ref> On May 25 'The Lotus Eaters - A Tribute To Dead Can Dance' is released, featuring Antimatter's version of Black Sun, recorded in October 2003.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/dead-can-dance-tribute-the-lotus-eaters-mw0000476033?cmpredirect|title= Various Artists - Dead Can Dance Tribute - The Lotus Eaters|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=AllMusic |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Moss's English sessions (‘Weight of The World’, ‘Legions’, ‘Epitaph’ and ‘A Portrait of the Young Man as an Artist’) commenced on 16 July in Studio 33, Liverpool, and featured a band assembled by Moss that year (Rachel Brewster – Violins, Ste Hughes – Bass and Chris Phillips – Drums), with Moss choosing to forgo any guest vocalists, performing all vocal parts himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=26942 |title=Planetary Confinement |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Prog Archives |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Patterson's sessions ('Planetary Confinement', 'Line of Fire', 'Mr White', 'Relapse' and 'Eternty Pt24') followed in December of the same year, with the vocal duties held by Amelie Festa and extra instrumentation by Mehdi Messouci (VÆV), Barry Whyte, Alex Mazarguil and Micheál ó Croinín.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.progarchives.com/album.asp?id=26942 |title=Planetary Confinement |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Prog Archives |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> By comparison Moss produced more organic sounding recordings while Patterson's still retained an electronic edge despite being acoustic based.

''Planetary Confinement'', a stark acoustic album in the face of two previous semi-electronic outings, was released on 29 July 2005, signalling Patterson's official departure from the project. Patterson announced his Ion project, while Moss simultaneously announced he would continue with Antimatter and was wrapping up the writing to the 4th album, to be titled ‘Leaving Eden’.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.funprox.com/news/duncan-patterson-leaves-antimatter-new-project/ |title=Duncan Patterson: leaves Antimatter, new project |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=30 Jun 2005 |website=Funprox |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Duncan Patterson has announced a wish to move away from Antimatter after the release of ‘Planetary Confinement’. He will concentrate on his new project, ‘Ion’...As for Antimatter, Mick Moss will continure the project with a new album for 2006 entitled ‘Leaving Eden’, featuring Anathema’s Daniel Cavanagh.}}</ref>

===Leaving Eden and Live@An Club (2006–09)===


In June 2006, Moss entered Fair Trade Studios, Liverpool, to record Antimatter's 4th album ''Leaving Eden'', re-assembling the band he had originally formed for his 'Planetary Confinement' sessions, with the addition of Danny Cavanagh.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-Leaving-Eden/release/954802 |title=Antimatter - Leaving Eden |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Discogs|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>
German rapper [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]] has released his fourth studio album ''[[Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück]]'' in September, with music completely sampled from the band, without permission. The rapper has sampled the songs "Epitaph" (from ''[[Planetary Confinement]]'') and "Terminal" (from ''[[Lights Out (Antimatter album)|Lights Out]]'') on his singles "[[Sonnenbank Flavour]]" and "[[Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück (song)|Von der Skyline zum Bordstein zurück]]" respectively.<ref name="laut.de">{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/Antimatter |title=Antimatter – laut.de – Band |publisher=Laut.de |accessdate=6 November 2015}}</ref>
In late October, Moss accompanied Danny Cavanagh and Leafblade on a Norwegian tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-s-moss-to-tour-with-anathema-s-danny-cavanagh/ |title=

[[Leaving Eden (Antimatter album)|Leaving Eden]] is released on 13 April 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://metalitalia.com/album/antimatter-leaving-eden/|title=ANTIMATTER - Leaving Eden |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Metal Italia |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> Moss spends the rest of the year touring the album, appearing in the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Poland, Greece, Turkey, Serbia, Croatia, Austria, Italy, Latvia and Estonia.<ref name="Livedates"/>

In April 2008 Antimatter headlined Poland's Art Rock Festival in Poznan.<ref name="Livedates"/> Later that year, Moss instigates a union with Duncan Patterson for the purposes of performing live together under the heading of ‘An Evening of Antimatter, Anathema and Ion Music’, bringing together both writers’ musical back catalogue into one live show with the first tour in this format being in September with Patterson and Moss touring Portugal and Spain, and uniting again for tours in Hungary, Romania, Italy, Finland, France, Poland and Latvia to round the year off.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-s-moss-discusses-renewed-collaboration-with-duncan-patterson/ |title= ANTIMATTER's MOSS Discusses Renewed Collaboration With DUNCAN PATTERSON|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= 4 Oct 2008|website=Blabbermouth |publisher= |access-date= |quote=Me and Duncan have kept in contact since he left ANTIMATTER, as he is one of my friends and our relationship wasn't based purely on music. During a talk one day in 2007, I suggested to him that we could form an alliance of our music, and perform kind of a masterworks tour of ANTIMATTER, ÍON and ANATHEMA material, but heading the bill as ourselves rather than a particular project name to avoid confusion. He agreed that it was a good idea, and we then put a set together and looked out for concert organizers who were willing to put it on, hence a tour in September and one later in November.}}</ref>
In October Moss announced a fifth album was in the construction stages, as well as ‘Alternative Matter’, a 10-year anniversary retrospective set of alternate versions and demos.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-to-release-retrospective-compilation-alternative-matter/ |title= ANTIMATTER To Release Retrospective Compilation 'Alternative Matter|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2 Oct 2008 |website=Blabbermouth |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

In 2009 Moss formed his own label, Music in Stone, to release Antimatter's ‘Live@An Club’, an acoustic performance recorded the previous year in Athens, Greece.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.aristocraziawebzine.com/en/interviews/mick-moss-antimatter/|title=Mick Moss - Antimatter |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=6 Apr 2019 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote= I started my own label ten years ago just to release Live @ An Club}}</ref> The album was released on April 10, coinciding with the first show of Moss and Patterson's 3rd union tour.<ref name="Livedates"/> A month later they would headline at Germany's annual festival Wave Gotik Treffen, one of the largest worldwide gothic subculture events.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://stalker-magazine.rocks/en/2009/10/06/wave-gotik-treffen-2009-2/|title=Wave Gotik Treffen 2009|last=Torneberg |first=Andreas |date=6 Oct 2009 |website=Stalker Magazine|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> In November, Turkish photographer and filmmaker Fethi Karaduman published his promo clip for Antimatter's ‘Epitaph’ track, from 2005's ‘Planetary Confinement’.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-epitaph-video-available/ |title=

2012 saw Moss enter Sandhills Studios to record the next Antimatter album, now re-titled to 'Fear of a Unique Identity'.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-Fear-Of-A-Unique-Identity/release/4210463|title= Antimatter Fear Of A Unique Identity |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Discogs|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> At the same time 'Broken Smile' by The Beautified Project was released, featuring guest vocals by Moss, charting at Number 1 in their native Armenia.<ref>{{cite AV media |people= Mick Moss |date= 2017 |title=Leaving Eden Audio Commentary (Fighting For A Lost Cause) |trans-title= |medium= CD |language= English |url= |access-date= |archive-url= |archive-date= |format=|time= |location= |publisher= Prophecy Productions |id= |isbn= |oclc= |quote=''I would go on to put out 7 more Antimatter releases over the next decade as well as launching the Sleeping Pulse project with Luis, and having a number one with The Beautified Project.'' |ref= }}</ref> On 1 June, Moss announced that he had signed a two-album deal with Prophecy Productions for 'Fear Of A Unique Identity' and the 6th album 'The Judas Table'.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/antimatter-signs-new-two-album-deal-with-prophecy-productions/ |title= ANTIMATTER Signs New Two- Album Deal With PROPHECY PRODUCTIONS |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=1 Jun 2012 |website=Blabbermouth |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> At the end of the year, on 23 November, [[Fear of a Unique Identity]] was released worldwide by Prophecy Productions, entering the official German Newcomer Chart at number 6.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.discogs.com/Antimatter-Fear-Of-A-Unique-Identity/release/4210463|title= Antimatter Fear Of A Unique Identity |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Discogs|publisher= |access-date= |quote=ANTIMATTER, the U.K. project whose recording/touring lineup has included current and former members of ANATHEMA, has signed a new two-album deal with Prophecy Productions. Work on the band's fifth LP, "Fear Of A Unique Identity" (formerly "Wide Awake In The Concrete Asylum") is largely completed; its release is tentatively scheduled for the second half year. ANTIMATTER's Mick Moss has also announced plans to release another album in 2013, entitled "The Judas Table".Commented Moss: "I'm energized to be working again with the label who guided ANTIMATTER through its first decade of existence. If any label deserves these next ANTIMATTER albums, it is Prophecy Productions."}}</ref>

2013 saw Moss tour extensively with pianist/vocalist [[Vic Anselmo]], throughout Europe, returning to Armenia In May that year to headline the '1st Annual Rock Fest Competition'.<ref name="Livedates"/> 
In September, the first electric Antimatter shows were performed in Italy by Mick Moss with his live band, marking an immediate change from bare-bones acoustic tours to full electric tours from this point onward, including by a package tour with Finnish band [[Swallow The Sun]] a month later, which Moss performed having been discharged from hospital after abdominal surgery only a day earlier.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.prog-sphere.com/news/antimatter-joint-european-tour-with-swallow-the-sun-and-the-foreshadowing/ |title=ANTIMATTER: Joint European Tour With SWALLOW THE SUN And THE FORESHADOWING |last=Savic |first= Niko |date=8 July 2013 |website=The Prog Sphere |publisher= |access-date= |quote=In October and November Antimatter will join Swallow The Sun on their “The Morning Never Came” anniversary tour. While Antimatter-concerts in recent months featured Mick Moss and Vic Anselmo as a duo in an acoustic setting, this tour will see the band playing with their complete line-up}}</ref>

On 18 March 2014, the song 'Too Late' was released digitally, which saw a return to a more acoustic-based sound in contrast to the New Wave sound of previous release 'Fear Of A Unique Identity', and ten days later the Antimatter live band embarked on a two-week tour performing the Leaving Eden album in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/2014/03/21/antimatter-too-late-single-leaving-eden-tour/ |title= Antimatter Release New Single "Too Late"; Euro Tour Starts Next Week|author=<!--Not stated--> |date=21 March 2014 |website=The Obelisk|publisher= |access-date= |quote=Antimatter have released a new single this week called “Too Late” that, instead of following up on the full-band feel of 2012’s Fear of a Unique Identity long-player, turns back to the intimate and contemplative folk experimentalism of past outings like 2007’s Leaving Eden.That’s fitting enough, since Antimatter will begin a European tour next week supported by Leafblade on which Moss and Company will play Leaving Eden in its entirety.}}</ref> The tour would be repeated again in Autumn.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.grande-rock.com/news/antimatter-announces-leaving-eden-live-2014-autumn-tour|title=Antimatter announces Leaving Eden Live 2014 Autumn tour |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=5 Oct 2014 |website= Grande Rock|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

On 31 October, Moss launched a new project Sleeping Pulse with Portuguese writer/guitarist Luis Fazendeiro, with the debut album 'Under The Same Sky' being released on Prophecy Productions.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://echoesanddust.com/2015/03/sleeping-pulse-under-the-same-sky/|title=SLEEPING PULSE – UNDER THE SAME SKY |last=Nice |first=Adam |date= |website=Echoes And Dust |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>

Two singles, Welcome To The Machine and Too Late were released on 23 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/63892-antimatter-welcome-to-the-machine-too-late.php|title=Antimatter Welcome to the Machine / Too Late |author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website=Album Of The Year |publisher= |access-date= |quote= release date:September 23, 2016 / format: EP / label:Music In Stone}}</ref> This marked the complete shift of Antimatter releases from Prophecy Productions to Moss' label Music In Stone, making Antimatter now a cottage industry a full eleven years after it had become Moss' solo project alone.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://progressivemusicplanet.com/2019/01/01/interview-with-mick-moss-of-antimatter-3/ |title=Interview with Mick Moss of Antimatter |last=Pociluk |first=Rob |date=1 Jan 2019 |website=Progressive Music Planet |publisher= |access-date= |quote=I’ve been watching young bands on social media making E.Ps/albums, pressing small runs and working on getting sales, and something inside of me has been getting increasingly envious of people going down this route...

Prophecy did want to re-sign me, and I made sure that they knew it was nothing against them, it was all about this urge inside of me... it really feels right, like a grass roots cottage industry or something.}}</ref>
The year was rounded off by an appearance at Hammer Of Doom Festival, Germany on Nov 19th followed by a one-off show with a string quartet in Kiev, Ukraine on Nov 26th which Moss described as 'a bucket list moment'.<ref name="Livedates"/><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.headbangerslifestyle.com/interviews/2394/antimatter-unique-and-intimate |title=Antimatter Unique and Intimate |last=Hegt |first=Liselotte|date=9 Jan 2020|website=Headbangers Lifestyle |publisher= |access-date= |quote=this was a one-off show, totally unique, there hasn't been an Antimatter gig like this before or after...I'd always wanted to play a show with strings, so this was a bucket list moment}}</ref>

The CD/DVD Live Between The Earth and Clouds was released on 3 March 2017, coinciding with a short tour marking the 10th anniversary of Leaving Eden that imagined what the setlist might have been if Moss had been able to perform the album with a live band back in 2007 instead of being limited to acoustic shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theobelisk.net/obelisk/tag/antimatter-live-between-the-earth-and-clouds/|title=Antimatter To Release CD/DVD Live Between The Earth And Clouds On March 3rd|last=Koczan|first=JJ|date=2 Feb 2017|website=The Obelisk|publisher= |access-date= |quote=The DVD is released to coincide with the retrospective ‘An Epitaph Tour’, which launches on the same date, celebrating the 10th anniversary of the breakthrough album ‘Leaving Eden’, and exploring the setlist that should have been performed upon the albums release}}</ref>
