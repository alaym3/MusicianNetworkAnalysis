'''He Is Legend''' is an American [[hard rock]]/[[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Wilmington, North Carolina]], formed in the late 1990s but settled on the name "He Is Legend" in 2003. According to the aggregate of the listeners, He Is Legend's music is similar to such of [[Alexisonfire]], [[Every Time I Die]], [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]], and [[Thrice]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Similar artists - He Is Legend|url=https://www.last.fm/music/He+Is+Legend/+similar|access-date=February 8, 2021|website=Last.fm|language=en}}</ref> The band's lineup is front man Schuylar Croom, guitarist Adam Tanbouz, bassist Matty Williams, and drummer Jesse Shelley.<ref name="HIL">{{Cite web|url=http://www.heislegend.com/|title=HE.IS.LEGEND.I.AM.HOLLYWOOD|date=April 17, 2004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040417030946/http://www.heislegend.com/|access-date=October 12, 2020|archive-date=April 17, 2004}}</ref>

== History ==
===Formation and beginnings===
The band's roots reach back into the late 1990s when Adam Tanbouz, Steven Bache, Matt Williams, and vocalist Schuylar Croom began writing and performing around Wilmington, NC while still in high school. In 2003, having previously played under the names of Stronghold, No One Wins, and The Uriah Omen, the name He Is Legend was adopted by members Tanbouz, Bache, Bell, Croom, and Williams. The name He Is Legend is an adaptation of the 1954 book [[I Am Legend (novel)|I am Legend]] by Richard Matheson. After releasing their first [[Extended play|EP]] in June 2004 entitled ''[[91025]]'', the band signed on with [[Solid State Records]] and released their first full-length album in November, ''[[I Am Hollywood]]'', which was followed by almost two years of extensive touring in the United States and Europe, the band temporarily relocated to California to record their next release. However, the release almost never saw the light of day as the group would almost break up right after they had finished recording. ''[[Suck Out the Poison]]'' was released on October 3, 2006.

===Departure of McKenzie Bell, Mitchell Marlow, and Worth Weaver===
Soon after the release of Suck Out the Poison, guitarist McKenzie Bell left the band. He was replaced by guitarist Mitch Marlow (previously of [[Classic Case]]). During their tour with [[Chimaira]], [[DragonForce]], and [[Killswitch Engage]] in spring of 2007, the first few weeks were played as a 4-piece without Marlow. During the Peanut Butt Tour '07, a different second guitarist, Worth Weaver, was seen playing in Marlow's spot. At their show at the School of Rock in New Jersey, Bache stated that Marlow had accidentally booked himself to produce a record for another band back in North Carolina. The dates of recording coincided with much of the tour, so he was not able to tour with the band. Worth stepped in and was, by the account of Bache, excellent in his performance. At their final show before beginning their tour in Australia, Marlow performed with the band, confirming that at the time he was still a member of He Is Legend.

The band's performances throughout the 2009 SXSW festival featured them as a four-piece once again. After a Plano, Texas performance on March 17, Tanbouz stated that Weaver, not performing with the band that evening, is planning on getting married soon and he would be focusing more on his solo musical career with his personal studio and music. Worth Weaver had begun standing in on the 2007 "Peanut Butt Tour" with the band.

===''It Hates You'' (2008–2009)===
On April 24, 2008, He Is Legend posted four demo songs from their sabbatical, entitled "Decisions Decisions Decisions", "Stranger Danger", "Don't Touch That Dial", and "Everyone I Know Has Fangs" from the upcoming record.

On April 16, 2009, the band confirmed that their newest album, ''[[It Hates You]]'' was being released through Tragic Hero records on July 21, 2009. (Originally set to be released on June 23). On May 27, 2009, the band posted "The Primarily Blues" and in early July "China White III", and "Future's Bright, Man" on their Myspace.

''[[It Hates You]]'' was released on July 21, 2009 and produced by Mitchell Marlow and Allen Jacob at Warrior Sound in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, with additional production by Kit Walters.

===Hiatus and new projects===
In September 2009, it was announced that He Is Legend is taking an "indefinite hiatus",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambgoat.com/news/view.aspx?id=13374|title=He Is Legend on hiatus|website=Lambgoat.com|access-date=September 27, 2009}}</ref> although the band itself made no public announcement of their hiatus.
