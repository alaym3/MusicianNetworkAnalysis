Kelly's success continued with the November 14, 1995 release of ''[[R. Kelly (album)|R. Kelly]]'', his eponymous second studio album. Critics praised him for his departure from salacious bedroom songs to embracing vulnerability. ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' contributor Stephen Holden described Kelly as "The reigning king of pop-soul sex talks a lot tougher than Barry White, the father of such fluffed-up pillow talk and along with Marvin Gaye and Donny Hathaway, [both] major influences for Kelly."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/17/arts/pop-briefs-020826.html?ref=rkelly|location=New York|work=The New York Times|title=Pop Briefs|date=December 17, 1995|first=Stephen|last=Holden}}</ref>
Also in December 1995, Professor [[Michael Eric Dyson]] critiqued Kelly's self-titled album "R. Kelly" for ''[[Vibe (magazine)|VIBE]]''.

Kelly's USBL contract contained a clause that would allow him to fulfill a music obligation when necessary. "If Whitney Houston needs a song written", said Ken Gross, the Seagulls owner who signed Kelly, "he would be able to leave the team to do that and come back".

Kelly began his ''Double Up'' tour with [[Ne-Yo]], [[Keyshia Cole]] and [[J. Holiday]] opening for him. After two shows, promoter Leonard Rowe had Ne-Yo removed from the tour because of a contract dispute. However, Ne-Yo alleges that the reason for the dropout was because Ne-Yo believes he received a better response from critics and fans, even though he performed at just two shows. Ne-Yo filed a lawsuit against Rowe Entertainment. Kelly was not mentioned in the lawsuit. In December 2007, Kelly failed to appear at another preliminary court hearing on his case due to his tour bus being held up in Utah.<ref>{{cite web|last=Orzeck|first=Kurt|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1576840/r-kelly-arrest-warrant-issued-over-missed-court-date.jhtml|title=R.

==Artistry==
===Musical style and influences===
Kelly's music took root in R&B, [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[soul music|soul]]. He was influenced by listening to his mother, Joanne Kelly, sing. She played records by [[Donny Hathaway]] and [[Marvin Gaye]], inspirations for Kelly.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}} In reference to Hathaway, Kelly stated: "A guy like Donny Hathaway had a focused, sexual texture in his voice that I always wanted in mine. He had smooth, soulful tones, but he was spiritual at the same time."<ref>{{cite web|last=Hoekstra|first=Dave|date=November 29, 1998|title=The Righteous Brother: R. Kelly's ambitious album of genre- spanning songs finds him updating the spiritually grounded R&B of such greats as Al Green and Donny Hathaway.|url=https://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/entertainment/ca-48624/2|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014164357/http://articles.latimes.com/1998/nov/29/entertainment/ca-48624/2|archive-date=October 14, 2012|access-date=October 26, 2014|website=Los Angeles Times|publisher=}}</ref> In his autobiography, Kelly stated that he was heavily influenced by Marvin Gaye's R&B Lothario image. "I had to make a 'baby-makin{{'}}' album. If Marvin Gaye did it, I wanted to do it", Kelly said.<ref name=":9">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMOfpYb4_PEC&q=Marvin+|title=Soulacoaster: The Diary of Me|publisher=Hay House, Inc|date=2012|isbn=9781401931773|access-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

While Kelly created a smooth, professional mixture of hip-hop beats, soulman crooning and funk, the most distinctive element of his music is its explicit sensuality. "[[Sex Me]]", "[[Bump n' Grind (R. Kelly song)|Bump n' Grind]]", "[[Your Body's Callin']]", and "[[Feelin' on Yo Booty]]" are considered to be examples, as their productions were seductive enough to sell such blatant come-ons. Kelly's crossover appeal was also sustained by his development of a flair for pop balladry.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===Vocal style and lyrical themes===
Writing for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' in 1997, Nunyo Demasio stated "With a voice that easily shifts from booming [[baritone]] to seductive [[alto]], Kelly has gained international celebrity by combining streetwise rhythms with sexually explicit lyrics."<ref name="shooting star"/> Love and sex are the topics of the majority of Kelly's lyrical content, although he has written about a wide variety of themes such as inspiration and [[spirituality]]. ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' reporters [[Jim DeRogatis]] and Abdon Pallasch observed about the contrasting themes: "... the image he liked to project was that of the "R&B Thug"... bringing the streetwise persona of the [[gangsta rap]]per into the more polite world of R&B."<ref name="singer swinger">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020609224145/http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-kelly09.html|archive-date=June 9, 2002|last1=DeRogatis|first1=Jim|last2=Pallasch|first2=Abdon|title=Inspirational singer or perverted swinger?|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 9, 2002|access-date=March 15, 2020|url=http://www.suntimes.com/output/news/cst-nws-kelly09.html}}</ref> Kelly expressed that he writes from everyday experiences and prides himself on being versatile. Larry Khan, senior vice president of Jive's urban marketing and promotion, said that Kelly's musical compass is second to none.<ref>{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8hIEAAAAMBAJ&q=R.+Kelly&pg=PA20|title=Hot Beats of Summer|last=Cohen|first=Jonathan|work=Billboard|volume=120|issue=20|page=20|date=May 16, 2008|access-date=November 2, 2014}}</ref> DeRogatis and Pallasch reported that at concerts where Kelly would go from singing "Like a Real Freak" to "[[I Wish (R. Kelly song)|I Wish]]": "Many fans found these abrupt shifts between the transcendent and the venal, the inspirational and the X-rated jarring."<ref name="singer swinger"/>

==Sexual abuse allegations==
Kelly has repeatedly faced allegations of sexual abuse that have resulted in multiple civil suits and criminal trials.

=== Early reports of sexual abuse (1990s) ===
In December 2000, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'' first reported that police had made two investigations that Kelly was having sex with an underage female but had to drop the investigations due to lack of cooperation by the girls accusing him.<ref name="accused of teen sex" /> A civil suit filed in 1996 by Tiffany Hawkins detailed allegations that, starting in 1991 when she was age 15, Kelly had sex with her as an underage high school student, encouraged her to recruit her schools friends, and pressured her into engaging in group sex with other underage girls.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=October 20, 2021|title=R.

Kelly was again accused of misconduct on April 17, 2018, by a former partner of his who claimed that Kelly "intentionally" infected her with a [[sexually transmitted disease]].

===Boycott and industry response ===
In May 2018, the Women of Color branch of the [[Time's Up (organization)|Time's Up]] movement called for a boycott of Kelly's music and performances over the many allegations against him. The boycott was accompanied by a [[social media]] campaign called [[Mute R. Kelly]]. In response, his management said that Kelly supports the movement in principle, but targeting him was "the attempted lynching of a black man who has made extraordinary contributions to our culture".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/r-kelly-times-up-muterkelly| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20210928/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/01/r-kelly-times-up-muterkelly| archive-date=2021-09-28|title=R Kelly: Time's Up campaign against me is 'attempted lynching of a black man'|first=Laura|last=Snapes|date=May 1, 2018|access-date=June 23, 2019|website=Theguardian.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The music streaming service [[Spotify]] announced on May 10, 2018 that it was going to stop promoting or recommending music by both R. Kelly and [[XXXTentacion]]. Spotify stated, "We don't censor content because of an artist's or creator's behavior, but we want our editorial decisions—what we choose to program—to reflect our values."<ref>{{cite news|last=Coscarelli|first=Joe|date=May 10, 2018|title=Spotify Pulls R.

====Allegations of music industry complicity====
''[[The Washington Post]]'' ran a lengthy article in May 2018, alleging that music industry executives had been aware of Kelly's sexually abusive behavior toward young women for years but did little or nothing about them due to his success as a performer and songwriter. As early as 1994, the newspaper reported, his tour manager had urged [[Jive Records]]' founder [[Clive Calder]] to tell Kelly he would not release the singer's records if he continued to have "incidents" with women after every concert he gave. Calder told the ''Post'' that he regretted not having done more at the time, saying "Clearly, we missed something."<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />

Former Jive president [[Barry Weiss]] told the newspaper that during 20 years with the label he never concerned himself with Kelly's private life and was unaware of two lawsuits filed against Kelly and the label by women alleging sexual misconduct, suits in which the label had successfully argued it was not [[Legal liability|liable]]. Larry Khan, another Jive executive who worked closely with the singer even after viewing the sex tape, likewise implied it was not the label's responsibility, and pointed to [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Jerry Lee Lewis]] as musicians whose labels continued to release and promote their records despite public awareness that they were involved with underage girls.<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />

Executives at [[Epic Records]] also took a similarly relaxed attitude towards allegations of Kelly's sexual misconduct, the ''Post'' claimed. In 2002, after he signed with the label, executive David McPherson allegedly avoided viewing a copy of a tape purportedly showing the singer having sex with an underage girl, even as he had warned Kelly's assistant that if it turned out to be Kelly on that tape, the label would drop him. McPherson did not respond to the ''Post''{{'}}s requests for comment. An [[internship|intern]] with the label whose work suffered after she began a relationship with Kelly, ultimately costing her the position, settled with Epic for $250,000; Cathy Carroll, the executive she worked for, regularly rebuked her former subordinate for having an affair with a married man whenever the two met at social functions for years afterwards, and the damage to the woman's reputation led her to abandon her career in the music industry. Carroll told the newspaper the woman was "starstruck ... A lot of times it's not really the men."<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />

''The Washington Post'' also suggested the labels were complicit in the sex-cult allegations from the previous summer's ''BuzzFeed'' piece. Employees at the studios where Kelly recorded were required to sign [[non-disclosure agreement]]s and not enter certain rooms, which they said they believed were where Kelly made the women stay while he worked. Despite the agreements, the newspaper was able to publish screenshots of text exchanges where women in the rooms asked Kelly's assistants to let them out so they could go to the bathroom or get food. The newspaper also published pictures taken after Kelly had concluded a six-week session at a Los Angeles studio, paid for by his then-current label, RCA Records, showing a cup of urine sitting on a piano and urine stains on the wooden floor of another room.<ref name="2018 Washington Post story" />
