'''La Roux''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ɑː|ˈ|r|uː}} {{respell|lah|ROO|'}}) is an English [[synthpop]] act formed in 2006 by singer Elly Jackson and record producer Ben Langmaid. The act's debut album ''[[La Roux (album)|La Roux]]'' (2009) was a critical and commercial success, winning a [[Grammy Award]] and producing hit singles such as "[[In for the Kill (song)|In for the Kill]]" and "[[Bulletproof (La Roux song)|Bulletproof]]". Recording of a follow-up album was marred by unsuccessful collaborations, the cancellation of two planned release dates, and reported conflict between the duo.<ref name="NME.com"/> Langmaid ultimately left the group in 2012, and Jackson released a second album, ''[[Trouble in Paradise (La Roux album)|Trouble in Paradise]]'', in 2014, maintaining the former duo's name as her stage [[persona]]. In 2020, she released her third album, ''[[Supervision (album)|Supervision]]''.

==History ==

===2006–2010: Beginnings and self-titled album===
In 2006, Jackson and Langmaid were introduced by a mutual friend. Her first project was named "Automan" and she wrote largely [[acoustic music]] due to Jackson's great admiration of acts like [[Nick Drake]] and [[Joni Mitchell]]. Her interest later shifted to electronic music.<ref name="LaRouxbio">{{cite web |first=Heather |last=Phares |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/la-roux-mn0001062118 |title=La Roux  |publisher=[[AllMusic]]. [[Rovi Corporation]] |year=2009 |access-date=28 July 2009}}</ref> The name "La Roux" referred to both the act and Jackson's stage persona; the name alludes to Jackson's red hair and tomboyish appearance, mingling the masculine ("le roux") and feminine ("la rousse") [[French language|French]] terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Interview-La-Roux/article-927484-detail/article.html |title=Interview with La Roux ahead of Nottingham date on the NME Tour |work=[[Nottingham Evening Post]] |date=24 April 2009 |access-date=11 February 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130505105845/http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/news/Interview-La-Roux/article-927484-detail/article.html |archive-date=5 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

La Roux's debut single, "[[Quicksand (La Roux song)|Quicksand]]", was released by French independent record label [[Kitsuné Music]] in December 2008.<ref name="LaRouxbio"/> She then signed to [[Polydor Records]] in order to release her debut album.
La Roux's second single, "[[In for the Kill (song)|In for the Kill]]", was released on 16 March 2009. Later, two prominent [[dubstep]] producers, [[Skream]] and [[Skrillex]], created remixes of the track.<ref>{{cite web |last=Grundy |first=Gareth |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/15/la-roux-in-for-kill |title=Electronic review: La Roux, In for the Kill (Skream remix) |work=The Guardian |date=15 March 2009 |access-date=25 April 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Klapper |first=Rudy |url=http://klap4music.com/2010/09/la-roux-in-for-the-kill-skrillex-remix |title=Klap 4 Music: La Roux, In for the Kill (Skrillex Remix) |date= 15 September 2010 |access-date=31 May 2011}}</ref> Another remix was made by Lifelike.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kitsuneshop.topplersmusic.com/shop/product/KITSUNE095 |title=La Roux – In for the Kill (Lifelike remix) |publisher=[[Kitsuné Music]] |access-date=25 April 2009}}</ref> "In for the Kill" debuted at number eleven on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 22 March 2009, peaking at number two four weeks later.

===2011–2015: Departure of Langmaid and ''Trouble in Paradise''===
In February 2011, at the [[53rd Annual Grammy Awards]], La Roux won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronica Album|Grammy Award for Best Electronic/Dance Album]] for her self-titled debut album. Her single "In for the Kill" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording|Best Dance Recording]];<ref name=Grammy53>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/NOMINEES |title=GRAMMY.com - The Official Site of Music's Biggest Night |work=The GRAMMYs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120201120225/http://www.grammy.com/nominees |archive-date= 1 February 2012 }}</ref> Jackson wrote on Twitter "This is the happiest I think I've ever been". This contrasts Elly Jackson's previous comments at the 2010 NME Awards, where she lightheartedly stated that the group "rarely wins awards". Ben Langmaid stated in a post-award interview that, the day before the Grammy Awards, the duo were rewarded with a double platinum set of discs from her record company, describing the weekend of the Grammy Awards as "My happiest weekend ever". In 2010, Jackson added vocals to [[Kanye West]]'s platinum-selling album ''[[My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy]]'', which was released on 22 November 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/kanye-west/53330|title=NME News Kanye West announces La Roux, Jay-Z, MIA will feature on new album - ''NME''|date=7 October 2010|work=NME}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1649541/20101007/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West Adds M.I.A., La Roux And Alicia Keys To Album|publisher=MTV News}}</ref> Jackson contributed vocals to West's debut album with [[Jay-Z]], ''[[Watch the Throne]]'', on the track "That's My Bitch".

La Roux were scheduled to start writing material for her second album during Christmas 2009 at her manager's home. Jackson said, "I think there will be a natural instrument or two on there though, which will make a change from the first record." She added that due to limited time, she did not think there would be "anything in terms of a second record for a while".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/la-roux/48610 |title=La Roux to begin work on second album |work=NME |date=27 November 2009 |access-date=2 December 2009}}</ref> As of January 2011, La Roux were writing her second album with a somewhat established [[indie rock]] band whose members are friends of Jackson. Jackson told the ''[[NME]]'', "I know I'm not going to stop writing until we've got songs that can compete on the same level as 'In for the Kill' and 'Bulletproof'".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/la-roux/54547 |title=La Roux writing second album with 'established' indie band |work=NME |date=14 January 2011 |access-date=17 January 2011}}</ref> In January 2012, Jackson described the second album as "a lot cheekier. Not '[[Cheeky Song (Touch My Bum)|Touch My Bum]]' cheeky or ''[[Carry On (film series)|Carry On]]'' cheeky—just slightly suggestive [...] A lot of music that's quite sexual is aggressive, but the music itself doesn't sound sexy—it's more people shouting, 'Look at my bum! Look!' I'm not turned on by it, I'm terrified." She also noted she felt a lot of pressure to replicate the quality of the duo's debut album.<ref>{{cite web |last=Harmsworth |first=Andrei |url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/01/20/la-rouxs-elly-jackson-the-music-on-our-new-album-is-a-lot-sexier-291122/ |title=La Roux's Elly Jackson: The music on our new album is a lot sexier |work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |date=20 January 2012 |access-date=4 January 2013}}</ref> Unlike the first album, album two was said to draw more on acoustic sounds and instruments, including guitars, organs and percussion; however, analog and digital synthesizers would still feature as part of the overall sound. Jackson confirmed she would be playing instruments on the record, in addition to co-writing, co-producing and providing vocals.

La Roux started a low-key comeback tour on 28 March 2013 in Brighton with two more venues in Bristol and Coventry during the following week. It was confirmed via a copy of the set list that there were four new songs: "[[Uptight Downtown]]", "[[Kiss and Not Tell]]", "Sexotheque" and "Tropical Chancer". Early reactions to the new material were positive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popjustice.com/briefing/la-rouxs-in-full-on-get-on-with-it-mode-and-about-time-too-to-be-honest/112377/ |title=La Roux's in full-on Get on With It mode, and about time too to be honest |website=[[Popjustice]] |date=29 March 2013 |access-date=29 March 2013}}</ref> Proof of a new album surfaced on 21 March 2014, when [[Tim Jonze]], music columnist for ''The Guardian'', tweeted that he "heard the new La Roux album yesterday and it was bloody brilliant."

In 2018, La Roux provided vocals for Whyte Horses' "The Best of It". In 2019, La Roux provided background vocals for [[Tyler, the Creator]]'s ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]'', for the track "Thank You". La Roux also provided vocals for Whyte Horses' cover of "[[Mr. Natural (song)|Mister Natural]]".

La Roux's third studio album ''[[Supervision (album)|Supervision]]'' was released on 7 February 2020 on Jackson's own independent label Supercolour Records.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.dejongensvanhemmes.nl/index.php?page=shop.product_details&flypage=shop.record_flypage&product_id=4251910&category_id=31&manufacturer_id=0&option=com_virtuemart&Itemid=39|title=La Roux-Supervision -Coloured-|website=dejongensvanhemmes.nl|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref> It was preceded by the singles "International Woman of Leisure" on 31 October 2019, "Gullible Fool" on 5 December 2019, and "Automatic Driver" on 23 January 2020. The album was met with mixed to positive reviews upon its release. Some critics praised its musical direction and production while others critically reflected on its repetitiveness. The record achieved only moderate commercial success, reaching no. 20 in the UK and no. 85 in Germany. It was her first album recorded entirely as a solo act.<ref name="auto1">{{Citation|title=Supervision (album)|date=2020-04-17|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Supervision_(album)&oldid=951544767|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>

La Roux has also come out as gay.

==Artistry==
Elly Jackson's first interest was in [[folk music]]. She was particularly interested in [[Carole King]] and [[Nick Drake]] whose music she discovered in her parents' record collection. Jackson's early musical material consisted of folk ditties influenced by [[Joni Mitchell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/breaking-la-roux-20091104 |title=Breaking: La Roux |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=4 November 2009}}</ref> Her taste in music changed during her mid-teens when she became involved in the [[rave]] scene.
