A year and a half after recording ''[[Josh Ritter (album)|Josh Ritter]]'', Ritter recorded his second album, ''[[Golden Age of Radio (album)|Golden Age of Radio]],'' for $1000 and self-released it.

On November 22, 2009 Ritter played at a benefit concert at [[Moscow High School]], his former high school in his hometown of [[Moscow, Idaho]]. The concert was for Jim LaFortune, one of Ritter's former teachers, who was diagnosed with a [[brain tumor]].<ref name="blog.timesunion.com">{{cite web|last=Janairo |first=Michael |url=http://blog.timesunion.com/localarts/josh-ritter-interview/3805/ |title=Josh Ritter interview - Arts Talk |publisher=Blog.timesunion.com |date=2009-12-02 |access-date=2015-10-16}}</ref>

In May 2018 Ritter revealed that he and his wife had adopted a child in January of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.joshritter.com/news/#post-818|title=News - Josh Ritter|website=Josh Ritter|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-26}}</ref> Their newest daughter Moxie was matched with them through Wide Horizons For Children, an adoption organization Ritter has advocated for. Part of his ''Gathering'' tour was cancelled to accommodate for this new addition to his family, though Ritter has promised to return to those markets for another show.

==The Royal City Band==
In 2010, Ritter's band members – some of whom had been performing with him from the early 2000s – were given the name "The Royal City Band" (a reference to the song "Thin Blue Flame" from ''[[The Animal Years]]'').
