==History==
[[File:2015 Foxygen-MainStage-Treefort-Credit-Amanda-Morgan-4 (16962868771).jpg|thumb|200px|Sam France of Foxygen performing at [[Treefort Music Fest]] in March 2015]]
Rado and France started their band in high school when both were fourteen. After their formation in 2005, the band played experimental music; influenced by psychedelia and avant-garde. Their early music won them first place in [[Agoura High School]]'s Battle of the Bands. They self-released four EPs between 2007 and 2011. In early 2011, they were 'discovered' by producer [[Richard Swift (singer-songwriter)|Richard Swift]] after handing him one of their EPs at a [[The Mynabirds]] show in New York.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/foxygen-we-are-the-21st-century-ambassadors-of-peace-and-magic#_|title=A Breath of Foxygen|last=Norris|first=John|date=January 15, 2013|newspaper=Interview Magazine|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref> The group were later signed on to [[Jagjaguwar Records]] and their first studio album, ''[[Take the Kids Off Broadway]]'', was released by [[Jagjaguwar]] on July 24, 2012.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/take-the-kids-off-broadway-mw0002381665 | title=Review: Take The Kids Off Broadway | website=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=August 14, 2012 | author=Thomas, Fred}}</ref>

On January 22, 2013, Jagjaguwar released Foxygen's second album, ''[[We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic]]''. This album was produced by Richard Swift and recorded at his National Freedom studio. The record was preceded by the single "Shuggie," released on October 4, 2012.<ref>Fitzmaurice, Larry (October 4, 2012). Pitchfork. Retrieved October 15, 2012.</ref> In March 2013, Foxygen was named one of [[Fuse TV]]'s 30 must-see artists at [[SXSW]].<ref>{{Cite web| title = 30 Must-See Acts at SXSW 2013 - Photos - South by Southwest - Festivals| work = Fuse| access-date = 2013-04-26| date = 2013-02-28| url = http://www.fuse.tv/galleries/2013/02/sxsw-2013-must-see-bands-south-by-southwest#10}}</ref> In 2019, ''We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic'' came at no.11 on ''[https://happymag.tv/ Happy Mag]''<nowiki/>'s list of "The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://happymag.tv/the-25-best-psychedelic-rock-albums-of-the-2010s/|title=The 25 best psychedelic rock albums of the 2010s|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-17}}</ref>

The band has gained a reputation for its unhinged live shows and maniacal behavior of lead singer France. In 2014, for their tours promoting the sprawling double album ''…And Star Power'', the group expanded to a nine-piece live band including three back-up singer/dancers.

The band released their fourth LP, the theatrical ''Hang'', on January 20, 2017, via Jagjaguwar.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tim Heidecker Experience: Music - w/ Foxygen|date=2017-01-18|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B83NiN9MVRA|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref> The album features collaborations with The Lemon Twigs, [[the Flaming Lips]]' [[Steven Drozd]] and a 40+ piece orchestra arranged by [[Trey Pollard]] and [[Matthew E.

The duo expressed their hope to create an album characterized by rock music mixing with the Hollywood style musical at the 30s. Allegedly, ''[[Hang (Foxygen album)|Hang]]'' is their first ever album to be recorded in a studio, prior to this their albums and songs written were all conducted at home.<ref>Daniel Durchholz, ["Music Foxygen takes on Hollywood – what a concept!"],''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'', August 4, 2017</ref> The duo also see the characters on the album as a continuation of their previous records. <ref>Greenhaus, Mike https://relix.com/articles/detail/foxygen_through_the_doors_of_perception/ Relix</ref>

In February 2019, they announced an April 26 release of a new album, ''Seeing Other People'', via Jagjaguwar. The lead single is called "Livin’ A Lie".<ref>[https://www.musicnewsnet.com/2019/02/foxygen-to-return-with-seeing-other-people-out-april-26-va-jagjaguwar.html] {{dead link|date=April 2019}}</ref>

==Critical reception==
The ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' staff wrote, "We just can't stop playing the scruffy psych-rock duo's [[The Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]]-obsessed album with the appropriately exuberant title ''[[We Are the 21st Century Ambassadors of Peace & Magic]]''."<ref>{{cite journal |title= The Must List: The Top 10 Things We Love This Week |journal= [[Entertainment Weekly]] |date= February 22, 2013 |location= New York |publisher= Time Inc. |page= 12}}</ref> In January 2013, [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] cited Foxygen under "Best New Music" in their review of the new album.<ref>{{Cite news

}}</ref> Their 2014 album, the [[Todd Rundgren]]-influenced ''[[...And Star Power]]'' received decidedly mixed reviews.  While ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]'' praised it as "...indulgent, unhinged, sprawling, funny and sometimes spookily great," and ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' called it a "dense and rewarding listen," Hal Horowitz at ''[[American Songwriter]]'' called it "...an occasionally interesting failed experiment."<ref>{{Citation|title=...And Star Power by Foxygen|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/and-star-power/foxygen/critic-reviews|website=Metacritic.com|access-date=2017-01-19}}</ref>
