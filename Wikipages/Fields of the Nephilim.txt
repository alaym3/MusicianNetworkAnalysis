'''Fields of the Nephilim''' are an English [[gothic rock]] band formed in [[Stevenage]], [[Hertfordshire]], England in 1984.
The band's name refers to a Biblical race of angel-human hybrids, known as the [[Nephilim]].

== Career ==
=== Early years (1984–1991) ===
Fields of the Nephilim's initial sound incorporated elements of [[hard rock]], gothic rock, [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[psychedelic rock]], and comprised a [[bass guitar|bass]] and [[guitar]] driven sound underpinned by McCoy's [[Death growl|growled vocals]]. Lyrically, the band incorporated themes concerning [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] (specifically [[chaos magic]]), the [[Cthulhu Mythos]], the [[Sumerian religion]], and the works of [[Aleister Crowley]].
The band had a "dust and death" image, associated with characters from [[Sergio Leone]]'s [[Spaghetti Western]]s and often wore cowboy [[Duster (clothing)|dusters]] with a weather-beaten look during photoshoots. This weather-beaten look was attained by dusting themselves down with, by their own admission, [[Mother's Pride flour]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Sumerland: Press: Sounds, 1988|url = http://sumerland.devin.com/articles/nephilim-sounds-1988.shtml|website = sumerland.devin.com|access-date = 15 October 2015}}</ref> This also proved problematic for the band as in May 1988, Nottinghamshire Police detained the band whilst a suspect substance was tested for drugs. This was later determined to be nothing but flour from the stage set.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Flour power Neph 'busted'|magazine=New Musical Express|date=28 May 1988|page=3|issn=0028-6362}}</ref>
 
Their debut EP, ''Burning the Fields'', was released in 1985 by [[Situation Two]] records (an imprint of [[Beggars Banquet Records]]). The band "upgraded" to Beggars Banquet in 1986 to release "Power" and "Preacher Man", and their first album, ''[[Dawnrazor]]'' which topped the Indie chart in 1987.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Sutherland|first1=Steve|title=A fistful of dynamite|magazine=Melody Maker|date=16 January 1988|page=24|issn=0025-9012}}</ref> The next release, "Blue Water", was the first Fields of the Nephilim single to reach the [[UK Singles Chart]] (number 75).<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> It was followed by "Moonchild", lead single from the second LP ''[[The Nephilim (album)|The Nephilim]]'' which reached number 28 in the UK chart.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Collins |first1=Andrew |title=Bluffer's Guide to Goth |magazine=New Musical Express |date=30 November 1991 |page=30|issn=0028-6362}}</ref>

''Psychonaut'' was released in May 1989 and peaked at number 35;<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> the ten-minute track indicated a slight shift for the band toward a more experimental and intense sound. This single/EP was a precursor for the polished and highly produced ''[[Elizium]]'' album (1990). Produced by [[Pink Floyd]] / [[David Gilmour]] engineer [[Andrew Jackson (recording engineer)|Andy Jackson]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Biography|url = http://andyjacksonmusic.com/biography/|website = Andy Jackson Music|access-date = 15 October 2015}}</ref> (taking over from previous band producer Bill Buchanan), the album was preceded by the single "For Her Light", which clipped the British Top 40 in its first week of release. A remixed version of "Sumerland (Dreamed)", released in November 1990, peaked at number 37.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

In 1991, the band played their final gigs, a two-day 'Festival of Fire' in London. The final releases of this era are the live CD ''[[Earth Inferno (album)|Earth Inferno]]'' and video ''Visionary Heads'', followed by the compilation ''[[Revelations (Fields of the Nephilim album)|Revelations]]''.

=== Departure of McCoy and hiatus (1991–1998) ===
Frontman McCoy left the band in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|title = Sumerland: Press: Melody Maker, October 1991|url = http://sumerland.net/articles/nephilim-melodymaker-2-1991.shtml|website = sumerland.net|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> The remaining members, together with singer Andy Delaney, chose not to continue with the "Fields of the Nephilim" name and recorded instead under the name [[Rubicon (English band)|Rubicon]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Sumerland: Press: Rubicon, Legacy, 1992|url = http://sumerland.net/articles/rubicon-legacy-1992.shtml|website = sumerland.net|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> The band released two albums before disbanding: ''What Starts, Ends'' in 1992 and ''Room 101'' in 1995.

Meanwhile,Carl McCoy formed a new project called [[Nefilim]]<ref>{{cite web|title = Sumerland: Press: Nefilim in Zillo, 1993|url = http://sumerland.net/articles/nefilim-zillo-1993.shtml|website = sumerland.net|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref>in 1991 after the disbanding of Fields of the Nephilim.

The band played some gigs in 1993, showcasing some new material. According to McCoy,<ref>[http://sumerland.devin.com/articles/orkus-interview.shtml Carl McCoy in Orkus Magazine, 1998], mentioning the album "could have appeared four years earlier". Accessed through Sumerland on 28 July 2009.</ref> the release of their debut album, ''[[Zoon (Nefilim album)|Zoon]]'', was delayed for several years due to disagreements with the record label. ''Zoon'' was eventually released in 1996 and featured a distinctly heavier sound<ref>{{cite web|title = Nefilim – Zoon – Reviews – Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|url = http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Nefilim/Zoon/22354/|website =Metal-archives.com|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> than McCoy's previous works.

=== Reunion and new album (1998–2002) ===
On 15 August 1998, McCoy and original bassist Tony Pettitt held a press conference<ref>{{cite web|title = Sumerland: Press: Zillo Press Conference|url = http://sumerland.net/articles/zillo-press-conference.shtml|website = sumerland.net|access-date = 15 October 2015}}</ref> at the [[Zillo Festival]] in Germany, announcing their future plans to collaborate under two separate monikers, Fields of the Nephilim (along with the Wright brothers) and The Nephilim (an altered spelling of McCoy's solo project).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sumerland.devin.com/articles/zillo-press-conference.shtml |title=Sumerland: Press: Zillo Press Conference|website=Sumerland.devin.com}}</ref>

According to different original band members, the band was rehearsing and writing the next Fields of the Nephilim album (with the exception of Yates). However, the awaited reunion of the original band line-up never happened.

In May 2000, McCoy released "One More Nightmare (Trees Come Down)", the first Fields of the Nephilim single with their new label, [[Jungle Records]]. It contained newly worked versions of "Trees Come Down" and "Darkcell," both originally released on the ''Burning the Fields'' EP in 1984. Between June and August 2000, the band made four live appearances at European festivals; Woodstage, Eurorock, [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] and [[M'era Luna Festival|M'era Luna]] music festivals.

In 2002, Jungle Records and Metropolis Records released the first Fields of the Nephilim studio album since ''Elizium'', entitled ''[[Fallen (Fields of the Nephilim album)|Fallen]]''. The release was not authorised by the band, and consists of unfinished recordings from 1997–2001, the 2000 reworkings of "Trees Come Down" and "Darkcell", and a previously unreleased demo by The Nefilim. The release was disowned by the band for many years,<ref>{{cite web|title = News|url = http://releasemagazine.net/News/news0209a.htm|website = releasemagazine.net |access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> and only one song from it, "From The Fire," has been performed live.

===''Mourning Sun'' and ''Ceromonies'' (2005–2008)===
Fifteen years after ''Elizium'', McCoy released ''[[Mourning Sun]]'', his fourth full-length studio album under the name Fields of the Nephilim. The album had seven original songs, with a cover version of [[Zager and Evans]]'s "[[In the Year 2525]]" included as a bonus track on the first 5,000 copies.

In interviews following the release of the album ''Mourning Sun'', McCoy mentions collaborating with ghost musicians but only John "Capachino" Carter is officially credited on the album.

In 2006, some European venues announced a tour was to take place, although this was never officially confirmed. In spite of high ticket sales, none of the gigs occurred.<ref>{{cite web|title = View topic – Nephilim Tour Cancelled? :: Heartland :: The Sisters of Mercy Forum|url = https://www.myheartland.co.uk/viewtopic.php?t=11898&highlight=&sid=ad6928eeb4799a16b3d1cf5534499a5d|website=Myheartland.co.uk |access-date = 15 October 2015}}</ref> Through the band's official website, McCoy emphasised that he had at not confirmed these dates with promoters or venues, and reiterated that people should not buy tickets for such events until official announcements through the band's website that such live performances were to go ahead.

In May 2007, McCoy performed as Fields of the Nephilim for the first time in seven years, at the [[London Astoria]]. According to the band's website, the event was filmed by video director [[Richard Stanley (film director)|Richard Stanley]],<ref>{{cite web|title = Other Works: Music Videos [Between Death and the Devil]|url = http://www.everythingisundercontrol.org/nagtloper/other/music.php|website=Everythingisundercontrol.org|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref> who had directed videos for the original band's singles: however, due to quality issues with the audio recording & filming it was abandoned.

‘'Ceromonies'’ was the culmination of a two night event sponsored by [[Metal Hammer]] magazine in which the band played material spanning the band's career. Performed at London's O2 Shepherds Bush Empire the band performed to sell-out crowds. The 'Ceromonies' line-up for this event that featured on the live album and DVD was McCoy, Carter, King, Edwards and Newell. Highlights of this period included the band's biggest ever headline show to date at the 2008 M'era Luna Festival, where the 'Ceromonies' line-up performed in front of over 23,000 people. The rapturous encore from this show, ‘Last Exit For The Lost’ was also included on Ceromonies.

In June 2008, a DVD entitled ''Live in Düsseldorf 1991'' was released. Sacred Symphony released the DVD and double CD box set as well as a double LP vinyl version of ''Ceromonies (Ad Mortem Ad Vitam)''<!---References support this apparent intentional misspelling---> on 16 April 2012, consisting of recordings and footage from the two concerts. The vinyl version does not come with the live DVD.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.invisibleoranges.com/2012/05/fields-of-the-nephilim-ceromonies/|title=FIELDS OF THE NEPHILIM released Ceromonies 2-CD live album|website=[[Invisible Oranges]]|access-date=3 April 2013}}</ref> It was also released as a Collectible box set coming in a wooden box with the Ceromonies logo and title branded on the wooden lid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fields-of-the-nephilim.com/RK/Products/CEROMONIES_BOXSET.htm|title=Fields of the Nephilim Ceromonies Collector Box-Set|website=Fields-of-the-nephilim.com|access-date=3 April 2013}}</ref>

Since 2008, McCoy and band have performed every year under the name Fields of the Nephilim at venues and festivals across Europe.

Fields of the Nephilim inspired a number of other bands, including [[Watain]] and [[Katatonia]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Celebrate: Fields of the Nephilim's 'The Nephilim' at 25|url = http://www.popmatters.com/feature/175956-celebrate-fields-of-the-nephilims-the-nephilim-at-25-by-beth-winegar/|website=PopMatters.com|access-date = 14 October 2015}}</ref>

=== Parody ===
From 1988, during the band's period of mainstream attention following the release of ''Dawnrazor'' and ''Psychonaut'', the music newspaper ''[[Melody Maker]]'' published various spoof articles about the band. This culminated in a regular feature called ''The Nod Corner'', which purported to be written by Nephilim drummer Nod Wright and which took a satirical view on the band's baleful and dramatic image, usually portraying McCoy as a prima donna who exploited and bullied Nod. Wright appeared to take the spoof graciously.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sumerland.devin.com/articles/nephilim-melodymaker-dec1989.shtml|title=Sumerland: Press: Melody Maker, December 1989|website=sumerland.devin.com}}</ref>
