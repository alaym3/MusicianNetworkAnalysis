==History==

===Formation and early releases (2012-2013)===
Ryan George had performed in a number of [[Punk music|punk]] and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] bands for several years before meeting Sara Taylor, who had ten years experience working as tour manager for musical acts of various genres.<ref name="iheartcomix">{{cite web|last1=Draper (Holloweyed)|first1=Matt|title=For the Children: An Interview with Youth Code (Interviewed by Holloweyed)|url=http://iheartcomix.com/children-interview-youth-code/|website=IHEARTCOMIX|publisher=iheartcomix.com|access-date=13 June 2016}}</ref> Taylor had never previously performed in a band, but was taught how to play [[synthesizer]]s by George. The pair started experimenting with various kinds of sounds until they created something that suited their liking. Vacation Vinyl, where Taylor had been working at the time, announced that there was to be a showcasing of music played by their employees; Taylor informed her manager that she and George would be performing under the name Youth Code. Following their debut performance, Youth Code released a demo tape called ''Demonstrational Cassette'', which became well-circulated and highly sought after.<ref name=swamp /> The inside cover of the tape reads "We Were Never Supposed to be a Band",<ref name="idieyoudie">{{cite web|title=An Interview with Youth Code (September 5, 2013)|url=http://www.idieyoudie.com/2013/09/an-interview-with-youth-code/|website=I Die: You Die|publisher=idieyoudie.com|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref> referring to the fact that Youth Code was only supposed to be a one-off gig.

[[File:Youth Code-2018-04-06-0001.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A photo of Ryan George performing live in Warsaw in 2018.|Ryan George performing live in April 2018]]

On the band's name, the pair have stated that they were originally going to make fake bands with Greh Holger, manager of the label Chondritic Sound. A split cassette was planned (though never released), in which Youth Code would play [[Nitzer Ebb]]-esque music, while Holger would perform music similar to that of [[Klinik]] and [[Clock DVA]].

Taylor had met and befriended the band [[Psychic TV]] while working as a tour manager. The duo was invited to release their 7-inch single "Keep Falling Apart" through Psychic TV's personal label, Angry Love Productions.<ref name="iheartcomix" /> The single was a limited release and sold out rapidly.<ref name="MTVabout" /> Youth Code released their self-titled studio debut in 2013 through Dais Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Youth Code-Youth Code|url=https://www.discogs.com/Youth-Code-Youth-Code/master/593649|website=Discogs|publisher=discogs.com|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref> The album's musical style was compared to those of prominent industrial music acts such as [[Front Line Assembly]] and [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]].<ref name="DiasS/T" /> The album caught the attention of mainstream media outlets such as ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', who described Youth Code's debut as "hellish" and "uncompromising", but balanced. Three tracks from their demo tape were re-recorded for the album.<ref name="pitchS/T">{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Zach|title=Youth Code- Youth Code Review (September 30, 2013)|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18592-youth-code-youth-code/|website=Pitchfork Media|publisher=pitchfork.com|access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref> A music video for the song "Carried Mask" was also produced.<ref>{{cite web|title=Youth Code - "Carried Mask" (Official Music Video)|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/music-video-premieres/youth-code-carried-mask|website=Noisey: Music by Vice|publisher=noisey.vice.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>

In late 2013, it was announced that Youth Code would open for [[alternative rock]] band [[AFI (band)|AFI]] starting in January.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Whitt|first1=Cassie|title=AFI Announce Youth Code and Coming as Support for January Tour (December 12, 2013)|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/afi_announce_youth_code_coming_as_support_for_january_tour|website=Alternative Press|publisher=altpress,com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> The announcement came just a few months after a stint supporting Belgian [[electro-industrial]] act [[Suicide Commando]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Vaudo|first1=Zak|title=Suicide Commando to return to Das Bunker|url=http://regenmag.com/news/suicide-commando-to-return-to-das-bunker/|website=Regen Magazine|publisher=regenmag.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> George described how they were so bewildered by the invitation that they could not refuse. The duo were not well received on stage, but stated that they generated more interest backstage, where they had conversations with mostly older members of the audience. George also noted that they "felt like missionaries" while performing with AFI, introducing industrial music to a younger generation.<ref name="FactMag">{{cite web|last1=Pattison|first1=Louis|title=Pretty Love Machine: How Youth Code are Dragging EBM back from the Dead (September 15, 2014)|url=http://www.factmag.com/2014/09/15/pretty-love-machine-how-youth-code-are-dragging-ebm-back-from-the-dead/|website=Fact Magazine|publisher=factmag.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> Youth Code also performed several dates in support of [[shoegazing]] groups [[Nothing (band)|Nothing]] and [[Whirr (band)|Whirr]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nothing, Whirr, Youth Code|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/769108266467948/|website=Facebook|publisher=facebook.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ho|first1=Maximilian|title=Nothing+Whirr+Youth Code+Constellation Room|url=http://larecord.com/photos/2014/05/31/nothing-whirr-youth-code-constellation-room|website=L.A.

Later in the year, it was revealed that Youth Code would be touring through the United States and Canada alongside industrial act [[Skinny Puppy]] for the Alliance of Sound Tour; also included in the lineup were British/Irish electronic group [[VNV Nation]] and German group [[Haujobb]]. However, VNV Nation dropped out of the lineup due to a "problematic situation" and was replaced by [[Front Line Assembly]] (who had previously done a remix of the song "No Animal Escapes" on the "Consuming Guilt" single);<ref name=consumesingle /> the tour was renamed the Eye vs. Spy Tour.

Using these influences, along with a variety of [[synthesizer]]s, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], and [[drum machine]]s, Youth Code created a style that has been described as "abrasive, discordant, and violently fast."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Voynovskaya|first1=Nastia|title=Youth Code Opening for Baroness at The Regency Ballroom|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/youth-code/Content?oid=4810032|website=East Bay Express|publisher=eastbayexpress.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> Taylor and George also draw from their past experience with the [[Hardcore punk|hardcore]] music scene.<ref name="FactMag" /> George has stated that "we listen to a lot of pretty music, punk, metal, industrial, techno stuff, and [we] kind of put everything into a blender without trying to mimic Nitzer Ebb", with Taylor responding "not that we ever tried to mimic Nitzer Ebb."<ref name="ViceHarm/Hate">{{cite web|last1=Hill|first1=John|title=Youth Code Becomes a Machine of Harmony and Hate on Their New Album 'Commitment to Complications'|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/youth-code-commitment-to-complications-interview|website=Noisey: Music by Vice|publisher=noisey.vice.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> Taylor has stated with regards to industrial music that "if five kids per 2500 capacity venue go home and Google what Skinny Puppy actually is, we’ve done our job for a genre we really like."<ref name="FactMag" />

Lyrically, Youth Code explores a number of issues including [[racism]], [[sexism]], [[transphobia]], and [[animal cruelty]].<ref name="FactMag" /> Taylor, who is Youth Code's primary songwriter, has said regarding the group's lyrical content that "I guess since I’m so vocal about my belief system, people assume every song has to do with a belief system and they’re like 'fuck yeah, political stuff!'."<ref name="ViceHarm/Hate" /> Taylor explained further:
{{Quotation|Writing lyrics is hard because you have to play this weird dance around with what you say... at least in my way of writing lyrics. Because if I were to just take the general approach of what I wanted to say the entire record would’ve read “fuck you for this,” ” I hate you,” and ” this is bullshit”.<ref name=ElectricWiz />}}

While Youth Code are often seen as a reviving force in the EBM/industrial music scene, the duo have rejected this proclamation, stating that they "don’t feel any pressure to try and resurrect anything."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Farrar|first1=Justin|title=Youth Code: Ready to Rule the World — Or Burn It Down (April 11, 2016)|url=http://news.rhapsody.com/2016/04/11/youth-code-ready-rule-world-burn/#|website=Rhapsody|publisher=news.rhapsody.com|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref>
