== Biography ==
Charles gained interest in music as a child, observing her uncle and aunt experiment on the production software [[Fruity Loops]]. In 2016, she enrolled in the [[New York University Tisch School of the Arts|Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music]] at [[New York University]] where she practiced her production and songwriting skills. During the second semester of her sophomore year, Charles met her current manager, Christian McCurdy. He introduced her to [[RCA Records]] A&R J Grand, and he flew her to [[Los Angeles]] to work with producers and other [[artists and repertoire]]s in the recording industry. Charles continued traveling between Los Angeles and New York City for short bi-weekly trips, allowing her to work on music in Los Angeles while still attending classes in New York City.  Charles left Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music in 2017 after signing a publishing deal with [[Universal Music Publishing Group]]. As a songwriter and producer, Charles' songs have reached platinum status, having written and produced for [[Beyoncé]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Chris Brown]], [[Cardi B]], [[SZA (singer)|SZA]], [[Kehlani]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Ariana Grande]], and [[Jason Derulo]].<ref name="Songwriters at UMPG">{{cite web|title=Nija Biography|url=https://www.umusicpub.com/us/Artists/N/Nija.aspx#|publisher=Universal Music Publishing Group (UMPG)|date=August 18, 2017}}</ref> Charles was placed on [[BET]]'s 2020 "Future 40" list, which is a list of "40 of the most inspiring and innovative vanguards who are redefining what it means to be unapologetically young, gifted & black".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chicagodefender.com/bet-digital-celebrates-black-excellence-with-new-original-editorial-series/|title=BET DIGITAL CELEBRATES BLACK EXCELLENCE WITH NEW ORIGINAL EDITORIAL SERIES|date=2020-02-07|website=Chicago Defender|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-15}}</ref>   She was named to ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone's]]'' "Future 25" in October, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Leight|first=Elias|date=2020-10-29|title=Hit Songwriter Nija Charles -- Future 25|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/hit-songwriter-nija-charles-future-25-1079745/|access-date=2020-10-31|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>
