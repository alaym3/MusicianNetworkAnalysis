==Controversy==
Shortly after Gloryhammer announced that Winkler had been asked to leave the band, a former romantic partner of bassist James Cartwright alleged that Cartwright had abused her over a five-year period.<ref name="loudwirealleged">{{cite web |title=Alleged Leaked Group Chats Suggest Gloryhammer Are Misogynists + Obscene Racists |url=https://loudwire.com/alleged-leaked-chat-gloryhammer-misogynists-racists/ |website=Loudwire |access-date=26 August 2021 | language=en-US | date=25 August 2021}}</ref> In addition, a Twitter account named "GloryhammerC" posted screenshots of what appeared to be an internal chat from 2017, between the members of the group that showed misogynist and racist behavior along with several racial slurs.<ref name="loudwirealleged" /> Bassist Vincent Jackson Jones, who collaborated with Gloryhammer keyboardist Chris Bowes in the band Wizardthrone, released a statement on 26 August 2021 distancing himself professionally from Bowes and urging Bowes to make his own statement; at the time, none of Gloryhammer's members had made public comments on the issue.<ref name="loudwirejones">{{cite web |title=Chris Bowes’ Bandmate Urges Embattled Musician to Make Statement in Wake of Obscene Gloryhammer Leaked Chat |url=https://loudwire.com/chris-bowes-bandmante-urges-statement-gloryhammer-leaked-chat-misogyny-racism/ |access-date=26 August 2021 |language=en-US |date=26 August 2021}}</ref> On 3 September 2021, Bowes and the rest of the band later released statements, admitting the leaked chat was true and apologizing for the racist and misogynist remarks. However they also stated that the claims regarding Cartwright and the alleged abuse were false.<ref>{{cite web |last1=DiVita |first1=Joe |title=Gloryhammer + Chris Bowes Finally Issue Responses to Racist + Misogynistic Leaked Chat |url=https://loudwire.com/gloryhammer-chris-bowes-response-statements-racism-misogyny-leaked-chat/ |website=Loudwire |access-date=6 September 2021 |language=en |date=3 September 2021}}</ref>
