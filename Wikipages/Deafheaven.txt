'''Deafheaven''' is an American band formed in 2010. Originally based in [[San Francisco]], the group began as a two-piece with singer George Clarke and guitarist [[Kerry McCoy (musician)|Kerry McCoy]], who recorded and self-released [[Demo (Deafheaven album)|a demo album]] together. Following its release, Deafheaven recruited three new members and began to tour. Before the end of 2010, the band signed to [[Deathwish Inc.]] and later released their debut album ''[[Roads to Judah]],'' in April 2011. They established a unique style blending [[black metal]], [[shoegazing]], and [[post-rock]], among other influences, later called "[[blackgaze]]" by reviewers.

Deafheaven's second album, ''[[Sunbather (album)|Sunbather]]'', was released in 2013 to wide critical acclaim, becoming one of the best reviewed albums of the year in the US.<ref name="metacritic2"/> In 2015 the band followed up with ''[[New Bermuda (album)|New Bermuda]]''<ref name="NBreview">{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21022-new-bermuda/ | title=Deafheaven: New Bermuda | publisher=Pitchfork | date=October 1, 2015 | access-date=March 20, 2016}}</ref> and in 2018 with ''[[Ordinary Corrupt Human Love]]''. Their 2021 fifth album, ''[[Infinite Granite]]'', drastically reduced the presence of [[screamed vocals]].

== History ==
=== Formation and demo (2010) ===
Deafheaven formed in February 2010<ref name="punknews5"/> in [[San Francisco]], [[California]] with vocalist George Clarke and guitarist [[Kerry McCoy (musician)|Kerry McCoy]], who previously performed in the [[grindcore]] band Rise of Caligula together.<ref name="kqed1"/><ref name="fader1"/> Clarke is not sure how he arrived on the name Deafheaven, though he is aware of its appearance in [[William Shakespeare]]'s [[Sonnet 29]]. The two words 'deaf' and 'heaven' were combined as a homage to [[Slowdive]].<ref name="dropp1"/>

Clarke and McCoy recorded [[Demo (Deafheaven album)|an untitled demo album]] in April 2010 at Atomic Garden Studios<ref name="gunshyassassin1"/> with [[Jack Shirley]] for about [[US$]]500, which the band could not afford at the time.<ref name="invisibleoranges1"/> Because the duo did not own an electric guitar or amp at the time, the demo was written on an acoustic guitar and recorded with equipment borrowed from the studio.<ref name="invisibleoranges1"/> The untitled demo, which was released digitally and on cassette tape in limited quantities, featured four songs that combined traditional [[black metal]] and [[post-rock]].<ref name="brooklynvegan1"/> Originally, Deafheaven did not intend to release the material, but they later sent it out to a few of their favorite blogs.<ref name="kqed1"/><ref name="brooklynvegan1"/> After the demo had been positively received, Clarke and McCoy recruited three additional musicians—bassist Derek Prine, guitarist Nick Bassett of the [[shoegaze]] band [[Whirr (band)|Whirr]] (formerly Whirl<ref name="punknews3"/>) and drummer Trevor Deschryver, who responded to an ad on [[Craigslist]]—to form a five-piece group, and started playing their first shows in July 2010.<ref name="kqed1"/><ref name="brooklynvegan1"/>

=== Signing to Deathwish and ''Roads to Judah'' (2010–2012) ===
Deafheaven announced they had signed to [[Deathwish Inc.]] in December 2010<ref name="punknews2"/>—a label that was founded by [[Converge (band)|Converge]]'s vocalist [[Jacob Bannon]]. Deathwish contacted Deafheaven, and originally only wanted to give their demo a wide physical release. By this point, the group already had some new material written and asked if Deathwish could release both the demo and the new material.<ref name="brooklynvegan1"/> The first release that Deafheaven released through Deathwish was a 7" vinyl single that featured "Libertine Dissolves" and "Daedalus", two songs that were taken from the group's demo. The single was pressed in a limited quantity and sent out as a gift to random people that made a purchase from Deathwish's webstore.<ref name="punknews1"/>

Their debut album, ''[[Roads to Judah]]'', was released on April 26, 2011 through Deathwish.<ref name="gunshyassassin1"/> The title of the album is a reference to the [[N Judah]] light rail that provides transportation in Deafheaven's hometown,<ref name="brooklynvegan1"/> and lyrically the album is about Clarke's "year of substance abuse and debauchery."<ref name="decibel2"/> ''Roads to Judah'' received positive reviews from ''[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]'' and ''[[RVA Magazine]]'',<ref name="decibel1"/><ref name="RVA"/> and was placed on several year-end lists including [[NPR]], ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' and ''[[The A.V. Club]]''.<ref name="npr"/><ref name="pitchfork"/><ref name="avclub"/> [[MSN Music]] also named Deafheaven one of the best new artists of 2011.<ref name="msn"/>

To promote ''Roads to Judah'', Deafheaven performed at Austin, Texas' [[SXSW|SXSW festival]] in March 2011,<ref name="kqed1"/><ref name="decibel2"/> toured the United States with the Canadian [[noise rock]] band [[KEN mode]] in June 2011,<ref name="lambgoat1"/> performed at California's Sound and Fury Festival in July 2011,<ref name="altpress1"/> toured the US with the post-rock band [[Russian Circles]] in November 2011,<ref name="altpress2"/> and performed a European tour in February 2012.<ref name="altpress3"/> McCoy said that Russian Circles "took us under their wing" while on tour and taught them how a band ought to behave. He said, "The three rules of any successful band are to write good tunes, be excellent live, and to not be an asshole while doing that. We were always striving to do that, but [Russian Circles] hammered it into our heads."<ref name="pitchfork3"/> Deafheaven also participated in the mid-2012 festivals [[Northside Festival|Northside]] in Brooklyn, New York<ref name="pitchfork2"/> and [[Fun Fun Fun Fest|Fun Fun Fun]] in Austin, Texas.<ref name="punknews6"/>

As a part of Deathwish Inc's free live album series, Deafheaven released ''Live at The Blacktop'' in July 2011. The album featured an entire live performance from January 15, 2011 in Bell Gardens, California at The Blacktop—a former [[loading dock]] converted into a venue.<ref name="punknews4"/> In October 2012, Deafheaven released a [[Deafheaven / Bosse-de-Nage|split EP]] with the American black metal band [[Bosse-de-Nage]] through [[The Flenser]]. Deafheaven contributed a cover of two [[Mogwai]] songs, "Punk Rock" and "Cody", released as a single track.<ref name="absolutepunk1"/> The two songs originate from Mogwai's 1999 album ''[[Come On Die Young]]''. Also in 2012, Deafheaven released a remastered, limited-edition vinyl record of its 2010 demo through [[Sargent House]].<ref name="metalstorm1"/>

=== ''Sunbather'', new lineup and critical acclaim (2013–2014) ===
As early as September 2011, Deafheaven announced they had begun writing new music for a potential split album, EP or full-length. At the time, McCoy described the material as being "faster, darker, a lot heavier and far more experimental" than ''Roads to Judah''.<ref name="punknews5"/> However, in December 2012, Clarke described their new material as less melancholic and less centered around black metal, but rather featuring a more "lush and rock-driven, even pop-driven" sound at times.<ref name="punknews7"/> The new album, titled ''[[Sunbather (album)|Sunbather]]'', was written solely by founding members Clarke and McCoy<ref name="nationalunderground1"/>—similar to the way its demo was composed, but different from ''Roads to Judah'', which was written as a five-piece band. The duo were also joined in the studio by new drummer Daniel Tracy,<ref name="spin1"/> who "added his own drum style to already-constructed song skeletons."<ref name="nationalunderground1"/> The title of the album reflects Clarke's idea of perfection. He stated that it is meant to represent, "A wealthy, beautiful, perfect existence that is naturally unattainable and the struggles of having to deal with that reality because of your own faults, relationship troubles, family troubles, death, et cetera."<ref name="nationalunderground1"/> Deafheaven entered the studio to record ''Sunbather'' in January 2013 with Jack Shirley,<ref name="punknews7"/> and released the album on June 11, 2013 through Deathwish.<ref name="exclaim1"/>

''Sunbather'' was critically acclaimed upon release. [[Metacritic]] rated the album 92/100, based on 18 reviews,<ref name="metacritic1"/> and later declared it the best-reviewed major album of 2013.<ref name="metacritic2"/> It was also Deafheaven's first release to chart on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''—it ranked at number 130 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 2 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name="allmusic1"/>

In addition to new drummer Daniel Tracy, who was a part of the band for the recording of ''Sunbather'', the band recruited bassist Stephen Clark and guitarist Shiv Mehra for 2013 tours.<ref name="fader1"/> Founding members Clarke and McCoy said previous band members parted ways due to difficulties with life on the road and earning little-to-no money.<ref name="invisibleoranges1"/> Deafheaven's first tour in support of ''Sunbather'' was a European/Russian tour with The Secret in April/May 2013<ref name="punknews8"/> followed by a US tour with Marriages in June/July.<ref name="absolutepunk2"/> In 2014, Deafheaven toured Australia in January,<ref name="pitchfork6"/> supported [[Between the Buried and Me]] with [[Intronaut]] and [[The Kindred (band)|The Kindred]] in February/March,<ref name="exclaim2"/> toured Asia and Europe in May/June,<ref name="altpress4"/> the US with [[Pallbearer (band)|Pallbearer]] in June,<ref name="altpress4"/> then embarked on a second European tour in August,<ref name="pitchfork5"/> and a North American tour with [[No Joy]] in September.<ref name="pitchfork5"/>

In 2013, Deafheaven members Daniel Tracy and Shiv Mehra formed a [[psychedelic rock]] side project called Creepers with Varun Mehra and Christopher Natividad. That year, the band released a self-titled EP, and in 2014, released its debut album ''Lush'' through All Black Recording Company<ref name="exclaim3"/><ref name="pitchfork7"/>—an indie label founded by George Clarke and former Deafheaven member Derek Prine.<ref name="brooklynvegan2"/>

On August 25, 2014, Deafheaven released a new single titled "[[From the Kettle Onto the Coil]]" as a part of the cable network [[Adult Swim]]'s 2014 weekly singles series.<ref name="pitchfork4"/> Clarke described the song as following a similar formula to songs composed for ''Sunbather'' and was not a strong indication of what the band's third studio album might sound like.<ref name="clash1"/>

=== ''New Bermuda'', ''Ordinary Corrupt Human Love'' and ''10 Years Gone'' (2015–2020) ===
[[File:Deafheaven Live 2018.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Deafheaven performing at Fete Music Hall in [[Providence, RI]] (November 2, 2018)]]

In July 2015, Deafheaven began teasing their third studio album for a possible October 2015 release through [[Epitaph Records]]' sister label [[Anti- (record label)|Anti-]] with a short video featuring new music clips, studio footage and views of a rocky coastline.<ref name="spin2"/><ref name="altpress5"/> On July 28, 2015, the band announced their third studio album, titled ''[[New Bermuda (album)|New Bermuda]]'', which was released on October 2, 2015, through Anti-.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/07/deafheaven-announces-new-album-new-bermuda/ | title=Deafheaven announces new album, New Bermuda | publisher=[[Consequence of Sound]] | access-date=July 28, 2015 | author=Kaye, Ben| date=July 28, 2015 }}</ref> ''New Bermuda'' was named the 12th best album of the year in 2015 ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine.<ref>[http://www.spin.com/featured/the-50-best-albums-of-2015/ The 50 Best Albums of 2015] ''Spin''.
