'''28 Days''' were an Australian [[punk rock]] band, which formed in 1997, by mainstay members Jay Dunne as lead vocalist, guitarist Simon Hepburn, and bassist Damian Gardiner. Their second studio album ''[[Upstyledown]]'' (July 2000), peaked at number&nbsp;one on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]]. Their singles, "Rip It Up" (May 2000), "Say What?" (November 2001) and "What's the Deal?" (October 2002), all reached the associated ARIA Singles Chart top&nbsp;40. After declining popularity following their 2004 album, ''[[Extremist Makeover]]'', the band released a greatest hits album ''[[10 Years of Cheap Fame]]'' (March 2007) before separating later that year. They reformed in 2009 to support long time friends [[Bodyjar]] on their End is Now Tour. 28 Days have released no new material since "Unmarked Graves" (April 2015). Their drummer, Scott Murray, died after being struck by a car in November 2001, aged 22.
