==Early life and education==

As a teenager, she went to Interlochen Arts Camp in [[Michigan]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] Artists Alliance in New York City.<ref name="Submithub" /><ref name=":2" />

She learned to play the [[Irish flute]] at the age of thirteen, having been "drawn" to the instrument from a young age.<ref name=":6" /> She is also able to play [[guitar]], [[ukulele]], [[electric piano]], [[cajón]] and classical flute.<ref name=":6" />

Reese attended [[Sidwell Friends School]] in Washington D.C. and attended  at [[Vassar College]], [[New York (state)|New York]]; she initially studied [[cognitive science]],<ref name=":2" /> before switching to Drama, in which she [[Academic major|majored]],<ref name="Submithub" /> and Religion, in which she [[Academic minor|minored]]. She also studied [[Drama school|drama]] in [[London]] in 2014.<ref name=":0" />

==Career==
===YouTube===
====Twisted Translations====
Twisted Translations (formerly Google Translate Sings and Translator Fails) is Reese's initial YouTube channel, in which she translates song lyrics and other texts through [[Google Translate]], through other languages and back into English, to create a [[parody]] of the song or text.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|last=Richman|first=Simmy|date=November 16, 2014|title=Mind your language: Song lyrics literally lost in translation|work=[[The Independent (newspaper)|The Independent]]|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/mind-your-language-song-lyrics-literally-lost-in-translation-9863260.html|url-status=live|access-date=May 18, 2020}}</ref><ref name="Huffingtonpost">{{Cite news|last=Matthews|first=Cate|date=November 2, 2014|title='Let It Go' According To Google Translate Is A Hilarious Mess (VIDEO)|work=[[Huffington Post]]|url=https://m.huffingtonpost.co.uk/entry/let-it-go-google-translate-malinda-kathleen-reese_n_4769275?ri18n=true|url-status=live|access-date=May 19, 2020}}</ref>

She came up with the idea of Twisted Translations while she was a student at Vassar College. After watching a video of "[[Let It Go]]" sung in various languages, she noticed that the Spanish translation wasn't exact. Her college friends began using Google Translate to create humorous alternatives to famous works of literature, inspiring Reese to do the same with song lyrics.<ref name=":2"/> Her first translation video was uploaded on February 10, 2014, and quickly went viral, amassing one million views within a week.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=July 29, 2015|title=Malinda Kathleen Reese '16: Singing a New Tune|url=http://info.vassar.edu/news/features/2014-2015/150729-malinda-reese.html|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 18, 2020|website=Vassar Info|publisher=[[Vassar College]]}}</ref> On February 14, she announced on YouTube that she would create more translation videos.
