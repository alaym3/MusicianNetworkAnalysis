==History==
===Early years (2002–2003)===
[[File:ProtestTheHero2004-2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Walker in Jan. 2004]]
The band started as Happy Go Lucky in 1999 and, shortly after, they recorded their first demo. In 2001 they changed their name to Protest the Hero. They released their first EP, ''Search for the Truth'' 7" vinyl, which included only two songs. They were included in the compilation ''(Coles) Notes from the Underground'' that same year. Luke Hoskin stated on his [[Formspring.me|Formspring]] page that ''Search for the Truth'' was recorded when they were 13 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formspring.me/LukeHoskin/q/424336942 |title=FormSpring blog page |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120801082106/http://www.formspring.me/LukeHoskin/q/424336942 |archive-date=2012-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The day that the band members finished their senior finals, they went on a three-week "Rock the Vote" tour from Toronto to [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] to garner recognition and raise awareness for the upcoming Canadian election.<ref name="The Sheridan Sun Online">[http://sheridansunonline.sheridanc.on.ca/feb_26_2009/entertainment_protest_the_hero.html]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}</ref>

===''A Calculated Use of Sound'' and ''Kezia'' (2003–2006)===
A music video for their song "These Colours Don't Run", from the EP ''[[A Calculated Use of Sound]]'', was released in 2003. The video begins with the band discussing the meaning of the song and features the band playing the song live at numerous locations in Toronto, with the album music dubbed over the actual live recording. At each location, the band would hand out lyrics to passers-by and encourage them to listen or sing along. [[File:ProtestTheHero2004-1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Millar in Jan. 2004]] In 2004 the band recorded their debut album for release the following year.  ''[[Kezia (album)|Kezia]]'' is a concept album, described by the band members as a "situationist requiem". The album achieved universal acclaim with many reviewers praising the album for its technicality and Walker's vocal range.

===''Fortress'' (2006–2010)===
After extensive touring the band returned to the studio in 2007 to record their sophomore effort. The resulting album featured 10 tracks that showcased the band heading in a more technical metal style than ''Kezia''. During the ''[[Fortress (Protest the Hero album)|Fortress]]'' tour the band released a live album (''[[Gallop Meets the Earth]]'') featuring tracks from their first 2 albums. Protest the Hero played ''Fortress'' from start to finish at their shows from November 20 to December 23, 2009. This stretch marked the last of the band's shows for a while as they took the first part of 2010 to work on a new album, which was to feature a more progressive sound.In September 2006, guitarist Luke Hoskin was detained at the [[Vancouver]]–US border for possessing a bag with less than 0.2 [[Gram|grams]] of [[marijuana]], preventing him from continuing on their [[Concert tour|tour]] with [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] and [[The Sword]].<ref name="Guitarist Luke Hoskin detained">{{cite web|url=http://sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=1733|title=Protest The Hero: Detained!|date=2006-10-25|access-date=2008-01-18}}</ref> In his place the band recruited Marco Bressette from the Canadian rock band Hypodust from September until November 2006.
