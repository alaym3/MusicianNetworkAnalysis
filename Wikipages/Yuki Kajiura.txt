She has provided the music for several popular [[anime]] series, such as the final ''[[Kimagure Orange Road]]'' movie, ''[[Noir (anime)|Noir]]'', ''[[.hack//Sign]]'', ''[[Aquarian Age: Sign for Evolution|Aquarian Age]]'', ''[[Madlax]]'', ''[[My-HiME]]'', ''[[My-Otome]]'', ''[[Pandora Hearts]]'', ''[[Puella Magi Madoka Magica]]'', ''[[Fate/Zero]]'', ''[[Sword Art Online]]'', ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'', ''[[Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba]]'' and the ''[[The Garden of Sinners|Kara no Kyoukai]]'' movies (amongst others).

Kajiura has also composed for video games, including the cutscene music for ''[[Xenosaga II]]'' and the entire ''[[Xenosaga III]]'' game soundtrack. She composed the music for NHK's April 2014 morning drama ([[asadora]]) ''[[Hanako to Anne]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www6.nhk.or.jp/drama/pastprog/detail.html?i=hanako|script-title=ja:連続テレビ小説|publisher=[[NHK]], Japanese Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=November 25, 2018|language=ja}}</ref>

==Biography==

She was born on August 6, 1965, in Tokyo, Japan. She has been into music since 1972 and accompanying her father on the piano. Her family later moved to West Germany because of her father's work. Kajiura wrote her first composition when she was seven years old titled " Thank you, Good-bye" as a farewell for her grandmother before leaving Japan.

Kajiura moved back to Japan when she was in middle school and later graduated from college. She began working as a systems engineering programming until 1992 that she decided to focus more on music.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yuki Kajiura Biography|url=https://canta-per-me.net/yuki-kajiura|work=Biography|publisher=Canta-Per-Me.net|access-date=March 23, 2020|date=January 26, 2016}}</ref>

In 2002, See-Saw participated in another Mashimo's project, ''[[.hack//Sign]]'' During the production of the series, Kajiura met [[Emily Bindiger]] and impressed by her vocals, offered her to perform over 10 of the series' insert songs. She has also jokingly called Bindiger "her English teacher" at [[Anime Expo]] 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yuki Kajiura Concert|url=http://www.anime-source.com/banzai/modules.php?name=Content&pa=showpage&pid=412|work=Anime Source|publisher=Anime-Source.Com|access-date=June 4, 2012|date=September 25, 2003}}</ref>

One of Kajiura's solo projects includes [[FictionJunction]]. The project involves collaboration with artists such as [[Yuuka Nanri]], Asuka Kato, and Kaori Oda. [[FictionJunction Yuuka]], with Nanri as the vocalist, is the most prolific of these collaborations. In 2004, the duo produced the opening and ending songs for Kōichi Mashimo's ''[[Madlax]]'' and in the next year, published their first collaborative album, ''Destination''.

In October 2007, it was announced that Yuki Kajiura would be attending the performances of the [[Eminence Orchestra]]'s concert, 'A Night in Fantasia 2007 – Symphonic Anime Edition', as a special guest.<ref>{{cite web|title=AU: Eminence Orchestra Returns to Sydney!|url=http://au.music.ign.com/articles/826/826140p1.html|work=IGN Music|publisher=IGN Entertainment, Inc.|access-date=June 4, 2012|date=October 10, 2007}}</ref>

The 2014 series [[Aldnoah.Zero]]'s opening theme "Heavenly Blue" was composed by Kajiura and was performed by [[Kalafina]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sonymusic.co.jp/Music/Info/kalafina/disco/archive/?SECL-1545|title=DISCOGRAPHY｜Kalafina OFFICIAL WEBSITE|website=www.sonymusic.co.jp|access-date=2018-03-08}}</ref>

In July 2016, [[Aniplex of America]] announced that the “Yuki Kajiura LIVE ~featuring SWORD ART ONLINE~” concert that took place in March 2016 in Japan would be having an additional date on January 14, 2017, at the [[Dolby Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, but was later canceled due to visa issues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2016-07-02/yuki-kajiura-to-hold-sword-art-online-themed-concert-in-hollywood-in-january/.103883 |title=Yuki Kajiura to Hold Sword Art Online-Themed Concert in Hollywood in January |date=2 July 2016 |website=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=22 August 2016}}</ref>

In December 2017, a source reported to a news site, Sponchi Annex that Kajiura was planning to leave her agency, Spacecraft Produce, over contract disputes. In February 2018, Kajiura herself confirmed via her Twitter that she has officially left her agency.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-02-21/anime-music-composer-yuki-kajiura-leaves-agency-after-25-years/.128069|title=Anime Music Composer Yuki Kajiura Leaves Agency After 25 Years|date=21 February 2018|website=[[Anime News Network]] |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2017/12/23/kiji/20171222s00041000445000c.html|title=アニメ業界で事務所トラブル 梶浦由記氏退社、カラフィナも活動休止へ 20億円超の打撃|date=23 December 2017|website=sponichi.co.jp |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2018/02/21/kiji/20180220s00041000338000c.html|title=アニメ音楽界のカリスマ・梶浦由記氏事務所退社、「カラフィナ」活動は白紙|date=21 February 2018 |website=sponichi.co.jp|access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref>

Kajiura has performed internationally at various anime conventions including Anime Expo 2003, [[Anime Boston]] 2009 (with Kalafina), Anime Expo 2012 (with FictionJunction), and Anime Expo 2018 (as part of Anisong World Matsuri).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://animecons.com/guests/bio/375/yuki-kajiura|title=Yuki Kajiura|website=AnimeCons.com|access-date=2018-12-27}}</ref>

On February 22, 2018, her contract ended with SpaceCraft Produce after being a talent for 25 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2018-02-21/anime-music-composer-yuki-kajiura-leaves-agency-after-25-years/.128069|title=Anime Music Composer Yuki Kajiura Leaves Agency After 25 Years|date=February 21, 2018 |website=animenewsnetwork.com|access-date=March 23, 2020}}</ref> She is now represented by FictionJunction Music, a talent agency she founded herself.
