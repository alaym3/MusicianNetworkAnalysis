'''The Tokens''' were an American male [[doo-wop]]-style [[human voice|vocal]] [[band (music)|group]] and record production company group from [[Brooklyn, New York]]. They are known best for their [[record chart|chart-topping]] 1961 [[single (music)|single]], "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]".

==Career==
The group was formed in 1955 at [[Brooklyn's Abraham Lincoln High School]], and was known first as the Linc-Tones.<ref name="Larkin2011">{{cite book|author=Colin Larkin|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=RA32-PA1981|date=27 May 2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|pages=1981–1982}}</ref> Originally featuring members [[Neil Sedaka]], [[Hank Medress]], Eddie Rabkin, and Cynthia Zolotin, Rabkin was replaced in 1956 by [[Jay Siegel]] (born in 1939), and the band [[recording session|recorded]] its first single, "While I Dream" with Sedaka on lead vocals that same year, which was a local hit in New York City. Sedaka and [[Howard Greenfield]] wrote much of the group's early material; they were unusual among teen vocal groups of the time in that they were not a [[cover band|cover group]].<ref name=sedaka92120>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPGdQRhMQ1E|title=Today's Mini-Concert - 9/21/2020 - Jay Siegel's Request|access-date=15 June 2021|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> In 1957, Zolotin left the band. Briefly recording as the Tokens and Coins, Sedaka left the group in 1958 to launch his solo career. Siegel and Medress then recorded three singles under a [[side project]] for [[Roulette Records]], Darrell & the Oxfords in 1959, with two other musicians who never joined the group.<ref name="Larkin2011" /> Finally establishing its most famous name and crew, the band became known as the Tokens in 1960 after they recruited the 13-year-old multi-instrumentalist and first tenor [[Mitch Margo]] and his baritone brother [[Philip Margo|Philip "Phil" Margo]].<ref name="Larkin2011" />

In early 1961, the Tokens released a single for [[Warwick Records (United States)|Warwick Records]] titled "Tonight I Fell In Love",<ref name="Larkin2011" /> which scored No. 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]] and earned the group an opportunity to perform on the television program ''[[American Bandstand]]''. The popularity that the band garnered as a result of this performance brought it new recording opportunities, culminating in its [[cover version|cover]] of  [[Solomon Linda]]'s "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]" for [[RCA Victor Records]].<ref name="Larkin2011" /> It reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart, where it remained for three weeks.<ref name="Larkin2011" /> The same track peaked at No. 11 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

From 1962 to 1970, the group released nine more songs that scored the Top 100. Jay Siegel was the lead vocalist on all the Tokens' hits including "I Hear Trumpets Blow" (1966) and "[[Portrait of My Love]]" (1967).<ref name="Larkin2011" /> Beginning in 1963, the Tokens also began serving as [[record producer]]s for other artists, such as [[the Chiffons]], [[Randy & the Rainbows]] and [[the Happenings]]. Their production company was called "Bright Tunes" and they also created their own record company, [[B.T. Puppy Records|B.T. (Bright Tunes) Puppy Records]].<ref name="Larkin2011" /> In 1972, Jay Siegel did background vocals for a re-recording of ''the Lion Sleeps Tonight'' with [[Robert John]] as the lead vocalist. This version hit No. 3 on the chart, and was awarded a Gold disc.<ref name="Larkin2011" />

In 1970, Hank Medress began producing an act for [[Bell Records]], Dawn, which featured the former teen-idol [[Tony Orlando]].<ref name="Larkin2011" /> It was as a favor to Medress that Orlando sang lead on the first record, "Candida", which became a Top 3 hit.

In 1973, Medress ended his relationship with the group and Siegel teamed with the Margo Brothers to form the group [[Cross Country (band)|Cross Country]], which would have some success with its [[cover version]] of "[[In the Midnight Hour]]".<ref name="Larkin2011" /> The Tokens reunited during 1975 for occasional weeks as singing regulars on the [[Adam Wade (singer)|Adam Wade]] hosted game show ''[[Musical Chairs (1975 TV series)|Musical Chairs]]'' and in 1978 recorded a song for ABC's ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'': "A Victim of Gravity".<ref>DVD credits, ''Schoolhouse Rock!: Special 30th Anniversary Edition'', 2002</ref>

Brothers Mitch and Philip Margo continued to perform with new members Jay Leslie, Mike Johnson, and [[Noah Margo]] (one of Phil Margo's sons) playing drums. Mitch Margo's sons, [[Damien Margo]] and Ari Margo, also make occasional guest performances with the band, exemplifying Phil Margo's saying: "If you hang around long enough you can grow your own band".<ref>{{cite web

Siegel continues to perform with his own version of the Tokens as well, featuring bass singer Bill Reid and, more recently, [[Jay Traynor|John "Jay" Traynor]], the original lead singer (before Jay Black) of [[Jay & the Americans]] and [[the Mystics]]. Siegel's son is also part of the group as keyboardist and occasional vocalist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KYYvJuDHEo |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref>

Jay Siegel's Tokens and the Margo brothers reunited in 2000 to perform on the [[PBS]] special, ''Doo Wop 51''. At the time, Siegel's Tokens were Siegel, Reid and [[Eddy Rezzonico]],<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i640hDvcqdQC&pg=PA2 |title=Manhattan's Musical Heritage - Tara Preston, Frank J.

==Legal controversies==
===Rights for "The Lion Sleeps Tonight"===
Decades after not receiving any publishing credit for their specific original musical composition part of "[[The Lion Sleeps Tonight]]", the band began a lawsuit in order to regain some of these publishing rights. The case was dismissed due to the [[statute of limitations]]. To this day, the Tokens claim that some of the original musical composition of the 1961 song was created by them, even though they have not been awarded this status by their record company.

===Name of the band===
On October 19, 2009, Phil and Mitch Margo filed suit in Manhattan for the rights to the ''Tokens'' name. They claim in their filing that Henry Medress suggested the name. In a competing suit filed in California by Siegel, he claims Siegel, Medress and Sedaka released an album named ''Neil Sedaka and the Tokens'' previously.<ref>{{cite web|last=Golding |first=Bruce |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/the_lion_sues_tonight_XN39F01kqi46xYp6qPO0yK |title=The lion sues tonight &#124; New York Post |website=New York Post |date=2009-10-19 |access-date=2015-08-18}}</ref>  On Sedaka's own website, there is a listing in his discography catalog for a 1958 release of ''Neil Sedaka and the Tokens'' as well as a second album, also during 1958, named ''Neil Sedaka and the Tokens and Coins''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090106061301/http://www.neilsedaka.com/discography.php] {{dead link|date=June 2021}}</ref> Sedaka and Siegel have remained close friends since Sedaka left the group.<ref name=sedaka92120/>
