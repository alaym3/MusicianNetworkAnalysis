'''Hey Violet''' is an American [[pop rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], consisting of Rena Lovelis (lead vocals, bass), Nia Lovelis (drums, percussion, piano, keyboards, synthesizers, backing vocals) and Casey Moreta (lead and rhythm guitar, backing vocals).

Formed in 2008 as '''Cherri Bomb''' while its members were still in middle school, the band was originally an all-female [[hard rock]] group, consisting of Julia Pierce (lead vocals, lead guitar), Miranda Miller (rhythm guitar, keyboards, backing vocals), Rena Lovelis (bass, backing vocals), and Nia Lovelis (drums, percussion, backing vocals). In 2013, Pierce left the band and was later replaced by Casey Moreta. In 2015, the group changed their name to Hey Violet and drastically altered their sound.

On January 23, 2013, Cherri Bomb announced on their Facebook page that they had parted ways with Pierce. When asked the reasoning behind Pierce's departure, Miller commented on her [[Tumblr]] that it was due to "creative differences", and that "we went our separate ways because we wanted to go in one direction and she wanted to go in another." However, after Pierce's departure was announced she took to her own Facebook page and clarified that she did not leave the band voluntarily. Pierce stated, "When I started Cherri Bomb five years ago, I envisioned something beautiful for this band. It's unfortunate that I'm no longer part of it. Sadly, what has happened wasn't my decision. I never imagined it ending up this way."<ref>https://www.facebook.com/JuliaPierceOfficial/posts/294954760626769</ref>

Guitarist Casey Moreta joined the band that year on a temporary basis on the rebranded band. On March 9, 2013, Moreta was asked to join the band permanently while performing on stage at the Viper Room.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaan2F3C9fk "Cherri Bomb's YouTube video"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318024701/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaan2F3C9fk |date=March 18, 2016 }} (March 11, 2013).
