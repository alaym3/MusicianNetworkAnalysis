In December 2010, Winky D, alongside Guspy Warrior and Terry Fabulous from Chimurenga drive in Zengeza, were scheduled to perform with [[Capleton]] on New Year's Eve . However, after failure to reach common ground, the "Musarova bigman" star withdrew and cancelled all his scheduled performance from Capleton's Zimbabwean tour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winky D withdraws from the Capleton Zim Tour|url=http://greedysouth.blogspot.co.uk/2010/12/winky-d-withdraws-from-capleton-zim.html|access-date=30 May 2013}}</ref>

==Feuds==
Winky D had 'beefs' with then popular dancehall artists such as Madcom and Dadza D. They battled back and forth lyrically, from which he emerged as a victor en route to become the most popular zim-dancehall act.

Winky D, alongside The General and Sniper Storm, were scheduled to perform as opening acts for [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Finally Mavado to Perform in Zimbabwe, Charges Reduced|url=http://www.radiovop.com/index.php/entertainment/8046-finally-mavado-to-perform-in-zimbabwe-charges-reduced.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215115258/http://www.radiovop.com/index.php/entertainment/8046-finally-mavado-to-perform-in-zimbabwe-charges-reduced.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Winky D performed first and kept Mavado and Sniper Storm waiting backstage. Efforts were made by the organizing people of the show to get the "Bigman" off stage and make way for a ten-minute Sniper Storm performance, but to no avail.  Sniper Storm then took matters into his own hands and snatched the mic from Winky D. Sniper's actions caused a rage as the crowd threw things onto the stage. This also caused heated debates all over the internet and street corners across Zimbabwe, as various musicians and entertainers reacted.<ref>{{cite web|title=Both Sides to the Winky Vs Sniper Storm story: Who is bigger? + Some exclusive footage of what really happened that one Friday night.

Winky D has seen more artist throw shots at him to gain popularity from him, which he has since ignored. The most popular of these is Seh Calaz, who has had considerable and noteworthy attention for his disses towards the ninja president, to which he has also not replied but only called for peace among the zim-dancehall artists through his songs (Mafeelings, tiki taka, sungura like and PaGhetto which he mentions Seh Calaz) and interviews.

==Gombwe album launch and birthday bash==
Having been over the years launching his album through low key events. The line up on the day included Buffalo Souljah, Killer T, Jah Signal, Vabati VaJehova and others. However, it was Winky D who took limelight and dished his extraterrestrial-gombwe magic on the fans who sang along and danced throughout the early hours of the morning. Another highlight, was Socialite and Businessman Genius Kadungure bid the first copy of the Album for $20,000 but he was forced to revise the initial amount after flamboyant Albert Ndabambi ‘outshined’ him by bidding the CD for $30,000. Ginimbi, as he was affectionately known in the world of socialites, dug deeper into his pockets forking another $20,000 to make it $40,000. In total Team Winky D walked away with $70,000 for his initial copy of "Gombwe: Chiextra. Oskid produced 13 out of the 14 tracks on the album with the exception of My Woman (feat. Beenie Man) which was produced by Nicky. All in all the Launch made history as the most attended Launch and most expensive Album in the country. The album itself, the performance on the night and launch proved Winky D is the best artist in Zimbabwe.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.herald.co.zw/winky-d-unleashes-gombwe-in-style/|title=Winky D unleashes 'Gombwe' in style|work=The Herald|access-date=2018-07-10|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailynews.co.zw/articles/2018/02/07/6-000-people-at-winky-d-album-launch|title=6 000+ people at Winky D album launch|work=DailyNews Live|access-date=2018-07-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsday.co.zw/2018/02/gombwe-winky-ds-crucial-moment/|title=Gombwe: Winky D's crucial moment - NewsDay Zimbabwe|website=www.newsday.co.zw|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-10|date=2 February 2018}}</ref>
