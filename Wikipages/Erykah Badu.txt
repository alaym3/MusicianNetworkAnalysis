She also has appeared in the documentaries ''[[Before the Music Dies]]'' and ''[[The Black Power Mixtape 1967-1975]].''

==Early life==
Erykah Badu was born Erica Abi Wright in [[Dallas, Texas]]. Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. The children's maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu had her first taste of show business at the age of four, singing and dancing at the [[Dallas Theater Center]] and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King.

By the age of 14, Badu was freestyling for a local radio station alongside such talent as [[Roy Hargrove]]. In her youth, she had decided to change the spelling of her first name from Erica to Erykah, as she believed her original name was a "[[slave name]]". The term "kah" signifies the inner self. She adopted the surname "Badu" because it is her favorite jazz [[scat singing|scat]] sound; also, among the [[Akan people]] in [[Ghana]], it is the term for the 10th-born child.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1355/is_4_99/ai_69202784 | work=Jet | title=Erykah Badu | first=Clarence | last=Waldron | year=2001}}</ref>

After graduating from [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]], Badu went on to study theater at [[Grambling State University]], a [[historically black university]]. She left the university in 1993 before graduating, to focus more fully on music.  During this time, Badu took several minimum-wage jobs to support herself. She taught drama and dance to children at the South Dallas Cultural Center. Working and touring with her cousin, Robert "Free" Bradford, she recorded a 19-song demo, ''Country Cousins'', which attracted the attention of [[Kedar Massenburg]]. He set Badu up to record a duet with [[D'Angelo]], "Your Precious Love", and eventually signed her to a record deal with [[Universal Records (defunct record label)|Universal Records]].<ref name="autogenerated1" />

==Career==

===''Baduizm'' and ''Live'' (1997–99)===
''[[Baduizm]]'', Badu's debut album, was released in early 1997. The album met with critical and commercial success, debuting at number two on the ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard]]'' charts and number one on the US ''Billboard'' [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/301879/erykah+badu/chart |title=Erykah Badu – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=2016-01-01 |archive-date=May 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190515102134/https://www.billboard.com/artist/301879/erykah+badu/chart |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/2000-12-09/r-b-hip-hop-albums |title=Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums: December 09, 2000 &#124; Billboard Chart Archive |magazine=Billboard.com |date=December 9, 2000 |access-date=February 11, 2014}}</ref> ''Baduizm''{{'}}s commercial and critical success helped establish Badu as one of the emerging neo soul genre's leading artists.<ref name="O'Donnell">O'Donnell, David.

===''Mama's Gun'' and ''Worldwide Underground'' (2000–06)===
[[File:Erykah badu-02-mika.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Badu backstage in Hamburg, Germany, in 2002]]
After taking some time off to raise her child, Badu returned in 2000 with ''[[Mama's Gun]].'' The album was characterized as more organic in sound than her previous studio album, and primarily produced by the [[Soulquarians]] and noted bassist [[Pino Palladino]]. A remix of one of the album's songs, "[[Bag Lady]]", was issued as the first single and topped the R&B charts for seven weeks. The album was well-received, with the lyrical content winning notices from many publications.

The two released "[[Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)]]" as a collaboration on the ''[[Brown Sugar (2002 film)|Brown Sugar]]'' soundtrack.

In 2005, she was a judge for the 4th Annual Independent Music Awards, to support independent artists' careers. Badu co-founded the ''[[Sugar Water Festival]]'' with [[Queen Latifah]] and [[Jill Scott]]. The trek played to amphitheaters and arenas in the United States during the summer of 2005 and 2006. It began in 2005 as an event to bring awareness to health issues to African-American women. British duo [[Floetry]] opened shows during the 2005 run. The festival was relaunched briefly in 2006 with [[Kelis]] opening the show and comedian [[Mo'Nique]] hosting the festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.citypaper.com/calendar/review.asp?rid=10686 |title=Sugar Water Festival with Jill Scott, Erykah Badu, Queen Latifah, Kelis, and Mo'nique |author=McCabe, Brent |date=August 9, 2006 |work=[[Baltimore City Paper]] |publisher=[[Times-Shamrock Communications]] |access-date=July 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5ztCFuiDj?url=http://www2.citypaper.com/calendar/review.asp?rid=10686 |archive-date=July 3, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 2006 was its final year.

Erykah received the concept in 2005 from underground artist 1080Temu and was due to start production of the CD, but a contract was never finalized by Badu; she took the concept and moved forward without official authorization. After receiving her first computer as a Christmas gift, Badu began communicating with and receiving music from Questlove, Q-Tip and J Dilla, among others. She later began to use her laptop as a mini recording studio to construct various backing tracks for songs, which led to the album's primary recording sessions at Electric Lady Studios in New York City.<ref name="Taylor">{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Patrick|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2008_03_newamerykah1.html|title=Erykah Badu :: New Amerykah: Part One (4th World War) :: Universal Motown|publisher=RapReviews.

On April 2, 2010, Badu was charged with [[disorderly conduct]] for appearing nude in Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas while filming the social-political, performance art, self-directed music video for "[[Window Seat (song)|Window Seat]]". No witnesses called police at the time of the incident, but the [[Dallas Police Department]] actively sought witnesses after the release of the video.<ref name=KrepsApril30>{{cite magazine|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|title=Erykah Badu Pleads Not Guilty to "Window Seat" Charge|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/erykah-badu-pleads-not-guilty-to-window-seat-charge-20100430|magazine=Rolling Stone|date=April 30, 2010|access-date=November 7, 2013}}</ref> Sgt.

In April 2014, Badu came under fire by the US-based [[Human Rights Foundation]], for performing at the birthday celebration of [[King Mswati III]], ruler and monarch of [[Eswatini]] (formerly known as Swaziland). Mswati, credited as Africa's last absolute monarch, is considered to be a serial human-rights abuser, ruling in luxury in a country infamous for its poverty and spiraling [[HIV]] rates. Badu presented Mswati with a $100 bill, and a good-luck stone.<ref>{{cite web|title=Erykah Badu under fire for singing to King Mswati III|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/entertainment/celebrity/2014/04/30/erykah-badu-under-fire-for-singing-to-king-mswati-iii|publisher=Times Live|access-date=May 1, 2014}}</ref>

In a January 2019 concert, Badu elicited boos from fans after giving support of musician [[R.
