==History==
===Formation and early beginnings===
Members Dan and Ryan met while attending the same college. Dan and Junate had known each other for several years and learned to play guitar together.  Eventually, they met Jack and the four later formed the band together. According to the band, the name comes from using the slang term "'Hunna' in everyday language with each other... We put 'the' in front and landed on 'The Hunna'. The name is also what we are really all about, we give 100% in our music and in our dumb lives."<ref name="Ass">{{cite web|last1=Game|first1=Jeff|title=Interview: The Hunna on creating music, touring America and new album 100|date=1 November 2016|url=https://www.axs.com/interview-the-hunna-on-creating-music-touring-america-and-new-album-10-109170|website=AXS|accessdate=17 November 2018}}</ref> They also cite a major hip-hop influence for the band name.<ref name="BrightonsFinest">{{cite web|last1=Game|first1=Jeff|title=The Hunna - Interview - 2016|url=https://brightonsfinest.com/html/index.php/9-articles/1707-the-hunna-interview-2016|website=brightonsfinest|accessdate=14 January 2017}}</ref> They released their first single "Bonfire" in October 2015.<ref name="Euphoria">{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Andrew|title=The Hunna - Bonfire |url=http://www.euphoriazine.com/blog/2016/07/videos-the-hunna-bonfire/|website=Euphoriazine.com|date=July 2016|accessdate=4 November 2016}}</ref>
