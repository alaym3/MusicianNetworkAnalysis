'''René Pérez Joglar''' (born February 23, 1978), known professionally as '''Residente''' (often stylized as '''Resīdεntә'''), is a Puerto Rican rapper and singer best known as one of the founders of the alternative rap band [[Calle 13 (band)|Calle 13]]. He released five albums with Calle 13 before announcing his solo career in 2015. Residente released his debut solo album in 2017. He has won four [[Grammy Awards]] and 27 [[Latin Grammy Award]]s—[[Latin Grammy Award records#Most Latin Grammys won|more than any other Latin artist]]. Residente has also delved into producing documentaries including ''Sin Mapa'' (2009) and ''Residente'' (2017) and has directed some of his own music videos.

Born and raised in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]], Residente developed an interest in art, music, and left-wing politics at an early age. He studied art at the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] in [[Savannah, Georgia]], returning to Puerto Rico in 2003 to work on music with his step-brother, [[Visitante]], with whom he formed Calle 13. Early in his career, his sarcastic and self-deprecating lyrical style garnered both praise and controversy. The group recorded five critically and commercially successful albums. His album ''[[Residente (album)|Residente]]'' was inspired by a DNA test the artist took to learn about his background, and was recorded in various countries around the world featuring a wide range of international musical styles. He has since released the singles "Sexo" in 2018, "Bellacoso" (featuring [[Bad Bunny]]) in 2019, and "René" in 2020.

He has been recognized for his social contributions and serves as the face of campaigns for [[UNICEF]] and [[Amnesty International]]. He has consistently defended education in Latin America and the rights of indigenous peoples. In 2009 he criticized the governor of [[Puerto Rico]] [[Luis Fortuño]] for laying off more than 30,000 public employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latinomusiccafe.com/2009/10/22/calle-13-wrong-insulting-puerto-rico-governor/ |title=Calle 13 wrong insulting Puerto Rico governor |publisher=Latino Music Cafe |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> In November 2015, Residente received a recognition award in Barcelona at the [[World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates]] forum due to his commitment to social awareness and for promoting peace.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cantor-Navas |first=Judy |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/calle-13s-rene-perez-receives-nobel-peace-summit-award_564c9edae4b045bf3df1e1dc |title=Calle 13's Rene Perez Receives Nobel Peace Summit Award |work=The Huffington Post |date=November 18, 2015 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

== Early life and education ==
René Pérez Joglar was born in a hospital in [[Hato Rey]], a sector within the [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] area. His mother, Flor Joglar de García, is a Puerto Rican actress who was part of the theatrical company called Teatro del 60 (Theater of the 60s). In her student years, she belonged to Juventud Independentista Universitaria or JIU (Independentist Youth of the University). René's father, Reinaldo Pérez Ramírez, is a labor lawyer, musician and writer. He studied in the [[Escuela Libre de Música]] (Free School of Music). When he was 17, together with Louis García, a trombonist and arranger, they founded the band, Latin Tempo. Reinaldo studied Political Science and Law at the [[University of Puerto Rico]] with the idea of contributing to the Independence of Puerto Rico. While he was studying Political Science, he became the president of the Juventud Independentista Universitaria (JIU). Immediately after he graduated from the School of Law, he founded a law firm dedicated to representing labor unions. In 1978, he traveled to Cuba as a representative of the youth of Puerto Rico and a member of the [[Partido Socialista Puertorriqueño]] or PSP (Puerto Rican Socialist Party). In the 1980s, he traveled to [[Nicaragua]] during the [[Sandinista Revolution]] to show solidarity with other Puerto Ricans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/ocio-y-cultura/rene-perez-joglar-puerto-rico-naces-estas-politica-3370661 |title=René Pérez Joglar: "En Puerto Rico, naces y ya estás en política" |date=July 10, 2014 |publisher=Elperiodico.com |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>

René grew up in a working middle-class neighborhood in [[Trujillo Alto]] with his brothers and mother. He was surrounded by art, music and sports from early life. He taught himself to play the guitar and took saxophone and drum classes. At 12 years old, he was part of the school band as a drummer. Since he was young, his interest for drawing and music was evident, but baseball was always his passion, a sport that he practiced for many years until he finished high school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/deportes/otrosdeportes/nota/orgullosoreneperezdecampanaparalospanamericanos-2034038/ |title=Orgulloso René Pérez de campaña para los Panamericanos &#124; El Nuevo Día |publisher=Elnuevodia.com |date=April 14, 2015 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> When he finished school, he had to make the tough decision regarding which path to take and chose the arts. He was admitted to the Escuela de Artes Plásticas (School of Visual Arts) in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where he obtained his Bachelor of Fine Arts degree. He earned a scholarship based on his portfolio and transferred to the [[Savannah College of Art and Design]] (SCAD), where he finished his Masters in Fine Arts.

While he was studying in Savannah, René created his alias "Residente Calle 13" to relive some memories from his childhood and during his free time began to write poems and rap songs. When he finished his Masters, he traveled to [[Barcelona]], Spain, with the dream of working there. After failing to find employment, he decided to take film courses because he also loved this form of art.
During the time he lived in Spain, he screened a short film he directed while he was a student in the SCAD called ''S=emp2'' or ''sexo = energía x masa x placer2'' (Sex = Energy x Mass x Pleasure2). He presented it in Madrid and won second place in a short film festival of independent films.

When he returned to Puerto Rico, he worked on a variety of art projects. He created illustrations and 3D animations for architects.  He also worked as a music video editor. During this period, he started to write again, this time from the capital, [[Old San Juan]]. René started to feed his writing with the essence of the boricua (Puerto Rican) life and its lingo. He also connected with the [[La Perla, San Juan, Puerto Rico|La Perla neighborhood]] since he lived across from it. All this is reflected in his first album later on. Having reached a better understanding of how and what to write about, René approached his brother, [[Eduardo Cabra]], to help him with the music.

Although many major labels did not pay attention to his music, René continued his search. It was not until one afternoon when René was without food in his refrigerator that he desperately called his brother, Gabriel, who recommended that he present his music to [[White Lion Records]], an independent music company responsible for the success of [[Tego Calderón]]. He wrote the song "Tengo Hambre" ("I'm Hungry") during this period. Elías de León, owner of White Lion Records, and his A&R Director, Karly Rosario, were the first visionaries to see René's great potential.

The duo gained recognition for their controversial song "[[Querido FBI]]", which responded to the killing of [[Filiberto Ojeda Ríos]], a key figure of the [[Puerto Rican independence movement]].<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/arts/music/11calle.html|title=Continuing Days of Independence for Calle 13|last=Rohter|first=Larry|date=April 18, 2010|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 7, 2009}}</ref> Shortly after, the duo collaborated with [[Julio Voltio]] on the single "[[Chulin Culin Chunfly]]", which reached number eight on the ''Billboard'' Hot Latin Songs chart, creating more buzz for the group.<ref name="outofnowhere" /> After the success of "Querido F.B.I." and "Chulin Culin Chunfly", the duo headed to the studio to record its debut album.

In December of the same year, Residente was invited by the [[Governor of Puerto Rico]] to join the campaign against Balas al Aire (Bullets in the Air). Residente and his brother, Eduardo Cabra (nicknamed "Visitante") composed "Ley de Gravedad" ("The Law of Gravity").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adendi.com/archivo.asp?num=42195&year=2005&month=12&keyword=Calle%2013 |title=ADENDI |publisher=ADENDI |date=October 26, 2011 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> At the same time, ''The New York Times'' invited Americans to visit Puerto Rico to have the opportunity to meet "the first intellectual who reached stardom with Reggaeton".<ref>{{cite web|author=36 Hours By JULIA CHAPLIN |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/29/travel/29hours.html?pagewanted=all&_r=2& |title=36 Hours in San Juan – The New York Times |work=Nytimes.com |date=October 29, 2006 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> His first two songs, along with the song "Suave", made him well known in Latin America.

While writing the follow-up to ''Calle 13'', the duo took a trip to South America to explore areas populated by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Latin America's indigenous]] and African-descended minorities.  Residente reflected on the journey, stating, "We saw horrible things, but also things that were incredibly beautiful.  Some of the contrasts are really intense."<ref name="Down'n'dirty">{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2007/04/11/2007-04-11_down_n_dirty_south_america_way.html|title=Down 'n' dirty, South America way|date=April 18, 2007|access-date=August 26, 2011|work=[[NY Daily News]]|publisher=[[Mortimer Zuckerman]]|last=Diaz|first=Margarita}}</ref>

Residente described the group's second album, ''[[Residente o Visitante]]'' album as more introspective and autobiographical than its predecessor.<ref name="Expands">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-06-07/features/0706060226_1_reggaeton-residente-bossa-nova|title=Calle 13 expands with tango and hip-hop|last=Burr|first=Ramiro|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=Tribune Company|date=June 7, 2007|access-date=October 3, 2011}}</ref> He explained that the group did not feel any pressure to compete with the success of ''Calle 13'', and felt that the recording of ''Residente o Visitante'' was a smoother process than the first: "The main difference for us this time around was that we had more opportunities, more tools and more money. We were also on tour at the same time, unlike the first. I spent my time writing during the travels, while my brother would write the music."<ref name="Expands" /> The album's lead single, "Tango del Pecado", was addressed to the parents of Residente's then-girlfriend, former Miss Universe [[Denise Quiñones]], who did not approve of the couple's relationship.<ref name="The Ugly" /> "Tango del Pecado" also created controversy due to the repeated chanting of "Súbele el volumen a la música satánica" (turn up the [[satan]]ic music).  Residente asserted that he did not add the line to create a reaction, saying, "I never do something expecting something. I do things because I like them."<ref name="Pushing Boundaries">{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/music-calle13-dc-idUSN2035242520070421?pageNumber=1|title=Q&A: Calle 13 continues pushing boundaries|last=Cobo|first=Leila|date=April 20, 2007|access-date=February 7, 2011|work=Reuters|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]}}</ref> ''Residente o Visitante'' debuted on the U.S. ''[[Billboard charts|Billboard]]'' [[Top Latin Albums]] chart at number one, displacing [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s Spanish album ''[[Como Ama una Mujer]]'', and on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 52, selling about 12,000 copies in its first week.<ref name="AlbumsThisWeek">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts/latin-albums?chartDate=2007-05-17|title=Residente o Visitantes&nbsp;— Week of May 12, 2007|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=May 12, 2007|access-date=October 5, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Lavigne">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1052411/lavigne-remains-no-1-as-joe-debuts-high|last=Hasty|first=Katie|title=Lavigne Remains No. 1 As Joe Debuts High|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|date=May 2, 2007|access-date=June 13, 2008}}</ref>

Residente once again became the subject of debate when the duo traveled to Cuba in March 2010, to perform in front of the [[United States Interests Section in Havana|American embassy]] in the country.<ref name="New York Times" /> Before the show, a political prisoner had died in a hunger strike in protest of the Cuban government, and Cuban exiles in Miami criticized the group for performing at such a time.<ref name="New York Times" /> Residente defended the performance, noting that it had been inaccurately reported and that "we said things that no artist had said from the stage, like 'here the people are in charge, and the government has to obey.'"<ref name="New York Times" /> These events had a major impact on Residente's lyrical style and the subjects he planned to discuss on the new album: "What's making me more mature is not about my age, it's about what I'm seeing and living. I'm not saying things carelessly anymore. I'm thinking before I say them."<ref name="Anger" />

With the lyrics on ''[[Entren Los Que Quieran]]'', Residente took a more political approach, inspired by events that transpired after the last album.<ref name="Anger" /> "Calma Pueblo" discusses various topics including dishonest politicians, [[Lip-synching in music|lip-synching]] in live performances, and [[payola]].

Hoping to understand his genetic background, Residente took a [[DNA test]] that revealed his roots trace back to 10 different locations around the World, including [[Armenia]], [[Ghana]], China and his homeland [[Puerto Rico]]. Such diversity inspired him to produce what would later result in a solo album, a documentary and a book released via [[Fusion Media Group]] ([[Univision Communications]]) under the same common title ''Residente''.<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite magazine|last1=Exposito|first1=Suzy|title=Calle 13's Residente Talks Exploring Global Roots on Star-Studded Solo Debut|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/calle-13s-residente-talks-exploring-global-roots-on-debut-w474279|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC|access-date=April 10, 2017|date=April 4, 2017}}</ref><ref name="TNYT">{{cite web|last1=Pareles|first1=Jon|author-link1=Jon Pareles|title=Residente Chases His Muse, at the Genetic Level|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/arts/music/residente-calle-13-solo-album-interview.html?_r=0|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 11, 2017|date=January 20, 2017}}</ref> In April 2015, Residente announced that he was in [[Siberia]] working on his debut solo album.<ref name=soloalbum>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/6568780/calle-13-rene-perez-solo-album|title=Calle 13's René Pérez Announces Solo Album|last=Cantor-Navas|first=July|work=Billboard|date=April 18, 2015|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> Residente released his debut solo album titled ''[[Residente (album)|Residente]]'' in 2017.

During an interview with Billboard, Residente criticized modern Spanish language urban music citing it as uninspired, simple, ignorant and redundant.<ref>http://reggaeton.com/web/rene-de-calle-13-critica-fuertemente-el-trap-en-los-billboard/ Calle 13 Billboard interview</ref> This prompted hip-hop and reggaeton artist [[Tempo (artist)|Tempo]] to respond lyrically which led to a highly publicized [[rap battle]].

On March 11, 2017, the artist's self-titled documentary, Residente, was released.

In April 2018, Residente released the single "Sexo" in collaboration with American producer [[Dillon Francis]]. In the song, Residente theorizes that the main motivation behind all human activity is sex.<ref name=sexobillboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8310336/residente-just-wants-sex-in-single-sexo-with-dillon-francis|title= Residente Tells You the One Thing on His Mind in New Video with Dillon Francis: 'Sexo'|work=Billboard|date=April 13, 2018|access-date=April 2, 2020|publisher=Prometheus Global Media}}</ref> Residente directed the accompanying music video, which was filmed in Colombia.<ref name=sexobillboard /> The upbeat song and colorful video were considered to be a stylistic departure from the more serious, introspective work showcased on his solo album, with ''Billboard'' explaining that the song "talks about sex in a joyful, all inclusive (the lyrics are intentionally gender-neutral), G-rated manner."<ref name=sexobillboard /> In July 2019, Residente released the single "Bellacoso" featuring Puerto Rican artist [[Bad Bunny]]. Musically, the song was inspired by [[Daddy Yankee]] and the lyrical content was inspired by feminist resistance, with the song advocating for consent and denouncing sexual harassment.<ref name=bellacoso>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-latin/residente-bad-bunny-bellacoso-video-interview-857951/|title= Inside Residente, Bad Bunny's Conscious Summer Jam 'Bellacoso'|last=Exposito|first=Suzy|work=Rolling Stone|date=July 26, 2019|access-date=April 2, 2020}}</ref> The music video, filmed in Puerto Rico, was directed by French cinematographer Gregory Ohrel.<ref name=bellacoso />

== Luis Fortuño comments ==
On October 15, 2009, Calle 13 won the Premios MTV Latinoamérica for "Best Urban Artist".<ref name="Fortuño esquívate este">{{cite web| url=http://www.primerahora.com/diario/noticia/tv/espectaculosasi/residente_le_tira_con_to_a_fortuno/338199| title=Residente le tira con to' a Fortuño| work=[[Primera Hora (Guaynabo)|Primera Hora]]| language=es| date=October 15, 2009| access-date=October 16, 2009}}</ref> Pérez hosted the ceremony, and used this exposure to insult Puerto Rican governor [[Luis Fortuño]] and comment about a civilian general strike that was organized earlier that day, held to protest the firing of more than 25,000 public employees by Fortuño's administration.<ref name="Fortuño esquívate este" /> Pérez generated much controversy after referring to Fortuño as an "hijo de la gran puta".<ref name="Latina Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/entertainment/music/poll-did-calle-13-go-too-far|title=POLL: Did Calle 13 Go Too Far?|last=Rosario|first=Mariela|date=October 19, 2009|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]|publisher=Vibe Media Group}}</ref> The phrase is commonly translated as "son of a bitch", although the phrase places emphasis on the mother of the subject being a prostitute, which many found disrespectful to Fortuño's mother.

== Social work, education and recognition ==

=== Humanitarian efforts ===
* In February 2011, the group had three shows in Luna Park of Buenos Aires, Argentina. It was requested at the entrance that the fans donate powder milk or school materials for people in need.<ref>{{cite web|author=Art Brut |url=http://espacioculturalborda.blogspot.com/2011/05/semiyero-rock-solidario-calle-13-y.html |title=Centro Cultural Borda: Semiyero Rock Solidario, Calle 13 y Centro Cultural Borda, colecta con fines artísticos |date=May 12, 2011 |publisher=Espacioculturalborda.blogspot.com |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> On May 10, 2011, Calle 13 appeared on the well-known Jimmy Kimmel show in the United States. René took advantage of the opportunity to share a political message, as he usually does. He wore a T-shirt that read, "Pa'l carajo la cuota" ("To hell with the quota"), alluding to the controversial quota of $800 that was imposed on the students of the University of Puerto Rico.<ref>{{cite web|author=Paola Capó-García |url=http://remezcla.com/music/calle-13-performs-jimmy-kimmel-live-music-video/ |title=Video: Calle 13 does Jimmy Kimmel Live! &#124; Music |publisher=Remezcla |date=May 11, 2011 |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref>
* After taking the T-shirt off, he revealed two messages written on his body. On the front, there was a message that read, "No al gasoducto" ("No to the pipeline"), in reference to the Via Verde project pushed by [[Luis Fortuño]], Governor of Puerto Rico (a pro-annexationist), for the use of natural gas that he wanted to build in the northern mountains of the Island for which he had already expropriated several rural homes and that would cause a great deforestation with the potential of causing a catastrophe of great proportions. On his back, the message read "Patagonia sin represas" ("Patagonia without dams"), protesting the Chilean megaproject, Hydroaysén.
* In November 2011, Calle 13 joined [[UNICEF]] in its campaign against the trade and exploitation of children. As part of this project, they filmed a documentary in collaboration with MTV Exit named, ''Esclavos invisibles'' (''Invisible Slaves''), and donated the track, "Preparame la cena" ("Prepare Me Dinner"), from the album ''Entren los que quieran''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/spanish/media/media_62000.html|title=Calle 13, MTV Y UNICEF lanzan en Nicaragua MTV EXIT}}</ref>
* In November 2011, Residente and his band Calle 13 performed in a concert in [[El Salvador]], where the money to buy the tickets was collected in rice and beans, which were later given to the people affected by the major storms that hit the country during two weeks.<ref>http://www.laprensagrafica.com/fama/espectaculos/230727-calle-13-en-el-salvador-a-cambio-de-arroz-y-frijoles-para-afectados-por-lluvias.html</ref>
* On May 25, 2012, they exchanged tickets for food again (beans and rice). This time, it was in [[Hermosillo]], Mexico, where they were able to collect more than 40,000 pounds (20,000 kilos) of food for the poorest community of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peopleenespanol.com/article/calle-13-recolecta-casi-50000-libras-de-comida-para-los-mexicanos|title=Calle 13 recolecta casi 50,000 libras de comida para los mexicanos}}</ref>
* On May 26, 2012, they participated in the Wirikuta Fest in [[Mexico City]] in support of Frente en defensa de Wirikuta (the Front in defense of Wikiruta). Wirikuta is a sacred desert that extends through more than 345,000 acres (140,000 hectares) in the City of San Juan de Potosi. It is being exploited by Canadian Mining companies, which are putting in danger endemic species and the health of the families that live there.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mexico.cnn.com/entretenimiento/2012/05/27/el-wirikuta-fest-se-transforma-en-un-llamado-de-justicia-para-mexico|title=Últimas noticias de Estados Unidos, Latinoamérica y el mundo &#124; CNN en Español}}</ref>
* On February 26, 2014, René Pérez visited [[La Fortaleza]], the residence of the Governor of Puerto Rico, for an informal meeting with the Governor [[Alejandro García Padilla|Alejandro Padilla]]. On this occasion, he brought two young people with him: Gerald Constanzo, from the community [[Martín Peña (Hato Rey)|Martín Peña]], and Jaylivan Díaz, from the Barriada Morales de [[Caguas]], to discuss with the Governor their neighborhood's needs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primerahora.com/entretenimiento/musica/nota/calle13almuerzaconelgobernadorenlafortaleza-992470/|title=Calle 13 almuerza con el gobernador en la Fortaleza|date=February 26, 2014}}</ref>

=== Commitment to education ===
Residente has been a strong fighter in favor of Latin American education, joining protest marches in Puerto Rico, Chile, Colombia and the Dominican Republic, among others.

* In April 2010, René showed a video at the University of Puerto Rico recorded by different local and international artists and athletes with messages of support to the student struggles in the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/noticias/locales/nota/renereuneaestrellasensolidaridadconestudiantes-694696/|title=René reúne a estrellas en solidaridad con estudiantes|website=El Nuevo Dia|date=April 29, 2010}}</ref> The same day, he fed the students that were protesting at the University and that had the campus closed down.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2010/05/14/aumentan-las-tensiones-en-la-huelga-de-los-estudiantes-puertorriquenos-videos/#.VikscypViko|title=Aumentan las tensiones en la huelga de los estudiantes puertorriqueños (+ videos)|date=May 14, 2010}}</ref>

In November 2011, during the Latin Grammy Awards, René wore a T-shirt that read "Educación Pública, gratuita para Puerto Rico, Chile, Colombia y República Dominicana" ("Free, public education for Puerto Rico, Chile, Colombia, and the Dominican Republic").<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diariolibre.com/revista/calle-13-hace-historia-en-los-latin-grammy-DKDL312607|title = Calle 13 hace historia en los Latin Grammy}}</ref>
