==Career==
===Acting===
====''Rocky Horror''====
Curry's first full-time role was as part of the original London cast of the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' in 1968, where he met [[Richard O'Brien]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skyoneonline.co.uk/tcom/tim_curry.htm |title=Terry Pratchett's The Colour of Magic: Sky One |date=18 January 2008 |access-date=15 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118092709/http://www.skyoneonline.co.uk/tcom/tim_curry.htm |archive-date=18 January 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> who went on to write Curry's next full-time role, that of Dr. Frank-N-Furter in ''[[The Rocky Horror Show]]'' (1973).<ref name="Guardian Piece">{{cite web |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,,1927272,00.html |title=We were all going to join this street theater troupe.

All he had to do was sing |access-date=26 March 2008 |first=Mark |last=Brown |date=20 October 2006 |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London}}</ref> Curry recalled his first encounter with the project:
{{quote|I'd heard about the play because I lived on [[Paddington Street]], off [[Baker Street]], and there was an old gym a few doors away. I saw Richard O'Brien in the street, and he said he'd just been to the gym to see if he could find a muscleman who could sing. I said, "Why do you need him to sing?" [laughs] And he told me that his musical was going to be done, and I should talk to [[Jim Sharman]]. He gave me the script, and I thought, "Boy, if this works, it's going to be a smash."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/146232172/Tim-Curry-intervirew | title=Curry Prefers the Sidelight for Now |publisher=[[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] newspaper syndicate |author-link=Frank Lovece | first=Frank |last=Lovece |date=8 December 1992 |access-date=21 May 2013}}</ref>}}

Originally, Curry rehearsed the character with a German [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] and [[peroxide]] blond hair, and later, with an American accent. In March 2005, in an interview with [[Terry Gross]] of [[NPR]]'s ''[[Fresh Air]]'', he explains that he decided to play Dr. Frank-N-Furter with an English accent after listening to an English woman say, "Do you have a house in town or a house in the country", and decided, "Yes, [Dr. Frank-N-Furter] should sound like the Queen".<ref name="Gross">{{cite episode |last=Gross |first=Terry |title=Star of 'Spamalot,' Actor Tim Curry |series=Fresh Air |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4679116 |network=[[NPR]] |date=15 March 2005 |access-date=8 October 2015}}</ref>

Curry originally thought the character was merely a laboratory doctor dressed in a white lab coat. However, at the suggestion of director Sharman, the character evolved into the diabolical [[mad scientist]] and [[Transvestism|transvestite]] with an upper-class [[Belgravia]] accent. This change carried over to ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'',<ref name="Film Talk">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5sTIGLo79g |title=Mark Caldwell interview with Tim Curry |publisher=Film Talk |date=September 1975 |work=Stoic Productions}}</ref> which made Curry a household name and gave him a [[cult following]]. He continued to play the character in London, Los Angeles, and New York City until 1975.

In an interview with NPR, Curry called ''Rocky Horror'' a "[[rite of passage]]", and added that the film is "a guaranteed weekend party to which you can go with or without a date and probably find one if you don't have one, and it's also a chance for people to try on a few roles for size, you know? Figure out, help them maybe figure out their own sexuality".<ref name=Gross />

In 2016, Curry played The Criminologist in the [[The Rocky Horror Picture Show: Let's Do the Time Warp Again|television film remake]] of ''The Rocky Horror Picture Show''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vulture.com/2016/08/tim-curry-endorses-foxs-rocky-horror.html | title=Tim Curry Is Perfectly Happy Fox's Rocky Horror Remake Is Doing the Time Warp Again (Again) |publisher=[[vulture.com]] | first=Jackson | last=McHenry | date=9 August 2016 |access-date= 9 August 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after the end of ''Rocky Horror''{{'}}s run on Broadway, Curry returned to the stage with [[Tom Stoppard]]'s ''[[Travesties]]'', which ran in London and New York from 1975 to 1976. ''Travesties'' was a Broadway hit. It won two [[Tony Award]]s (Best Performance by an Actor for [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]] and Best Comedy), as well as the [[New York Drama Critics Circle Award]] (Best Play), and Curry's performance as the famous [[dadaist]] [[Tristan Tzara]] received good reviews.<ref name=interview>{{cite journal |title=NEW AGAIN: TIM CURRY |journal=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |date=25 February 2015 |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/film/new-again-tim-curry}}</ref>

In 1981, Curry formed part of the original cast in the Broadway show ''[[Amadeus (play)|Amadeus]]'', playing the title character, [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]].

In 1985, Curry starred in the [[fantasy film]] ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' as The Lord of Darkness. Director [[Ridley Scott]] cast Curry in the film after watching him in ''Rocky Horror'', thinking he was ideal to play the role of Darkness. It took five and a half hours to apply the makeup needed for Darkness onto Curry and at the end of the day, he would spend an hour in a bath in order to liquefy the soluble spirit gum. The same year, he appeared in the [[Comedy film|comedy]] [[mystery film]] ''[[Clue (film)|Clue]]'' as Wadsworth the butler.

After this, Curry began to be cast in more comedy roles throughout the late 1980s and '90s such as Rev.

In the early 2000s, Curry was cast in the [[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|film adaptation]] of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' in the role of Roger Corwin, and in the [[parody film]] ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'' playing Professor Oldman. Curry went on to play Thurman Rice, a supporting role in the [[biographical film]] ''[[Kinsey (film)|Kinsey]]''. In later years, Curry has mostly performed voice roles for animated films and television series. His last feature film onscreen role to date has been in the British [[black comedy]] ''[[Burke & Hare (2010 film)|Burke & Hare]]'' as [[Alexander Monro (tertius)|Alexander Monro]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Burke and Hare (2010)|date=9 September 2011|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1320239/|access-date=23 August 2017}}</ref>

I think he's very clever. It'll be interesting to see what sort of clown face he puts on. because it's not an obvious clown face at all.[..] So I'm fascinated to see it."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://nofspodcast.com/exclusive-tim-curry-it-reboot-pennywise/|title=[Exclusive] Tim Curry's Take on the New IT Reboot {{!}} Nightmare on Film Street|date=1 September 2017 |work=Nightmare on Film Street|access-date=12 January 2018 |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Music===
Aside from his performances on various soundtrack records, Curry has had some success as a solo musical artist. Curry received classical vocal training as a boy. He has mentioned that his musical influences included jazz vocalists such as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Louis Armstrong]] and idolised [[the Beatles]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] as a teenager. In 1978, [[A&M Records]] released Curry's debut solo album ''[[Read My Lips (Tim Curry album)|Read My Lips]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The album featured an eclectic range of songs (mostly [[cover version|covers]]) performed in diverse genres. Highlights of the album are a [[reggae]] version of the Beatles' song "[[I Will]]", a rendition of "Wake Nicodemus" featuring the Pipes and Drums of the [[48th Highlanders of Canada]], and a bar-room ballad, "Alan", composed by [[Canadians|Canadian]] singer-songwriter Tony Kosinec.  In 1979 he scored a hit with "I do the Rock" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kXPCsaO_55o

The following year, Curry released his second and most successful album ''[[Fearless (Tim Curry album)|Fearless]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The [[Gramophone record|LP]] was more rock-oriented than ''Read My Lips'' and mostly featured original songs rather than cover versions. The record included Curry's only US charting songs: "I Do the Rock" and "Paradise Garage".

Curry's third and final album, ''[[Simplicity (Tim Curry album)|Simplicity]]'', was released in 1981, again by A&M Records.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=140}}</ref> This record, which did not sell as well as the previous offerings, combined both original songs and cover versions. Still, it was the only Curry recording to hit the charts in Canada, reaching #45 on the album chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/028020/f2/nlc008388.0387.pdf| title=RPM Top 50 Albums - September 26, 1981}}</ref> The writing, production, and musician roster for Curry's solo albums included an impressive list of collaborators, including [[Bob Ezrin]], [[Dick Wagner]], and [[David Sanborn]].

Although Curry's first album was released in 1978, he had previously recorded a nine-track album for [[Lou Adler]]'s Ode Records in 1976. However, the album remained unreleased in its entirety until February 2010, when it was made available as a legal download entitled ''...From the Vaults'' (though four tracks from these sessions had been released on a 1990 ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror]]'' box set). The album, produced by Adler, included Curry's rendition of [[The Supremes]]' hit "[[Baby Love]]".
