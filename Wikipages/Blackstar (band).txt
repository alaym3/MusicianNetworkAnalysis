'''Blackstar''' were a British [[hard rock]] band, formed as a retooling of the band [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] in 1995 without [[Bill Steer]] along with former [[Cathedral (band)|Cathedral]] guitarist Mark Griffiths. 
The band name comes from a [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] song off the ''[[Swansong (album)|Swansong]]'' 1996 album. Thus far they have released only a single album.
After a while the band was forced to change its name to '''Blackstar Rising'''. The band dissolved because [[Ken Owen]] suffered from a [[brain haemorrhage]].
