{{nihongo|'''V6'''|ブイシックス|Bui Shikkusu|}} was a six-member Japanese [[boy band]] formed by [[Johnny & Associates]]. The group debuted on November 1, 1995 with the single "Music for the People", which was used as the image song for the World Cup of Volleyball in 1995. Their first four singles, including "Music for the People", were all [[cover version]]s of the same-titled [[Eurobeat]] songs composed by Italian producers such as [[Giancarlo Pasquini]], [[Andrea Leonardi]], [[Alberto Contini]], Sandro Oliva.

Similar to their agency [[senpai|seniors]] [[Hikaru Genji (band)|Hikaru Genji]], the group is separated into two subgroups based on age. For V6, the group is split into 20th Century and Coming Century, which consists of the three oldest members and three youngest members respectively. The band sold more than 13.5 million albums and singles.

As announced on March 12, 2021, V6 disbanded on November 1, 2021, their 26th anniversary since debut.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-12|title=Japanese Boy Band V6 Will Disband This November|url=https://www.siliconera.com/japanese-boy-band-v6-will-disband-this-november/|access-date=2021-07-21|website=Siliconera|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==

===Name===
In an interview on ''[[Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ]]'', the group stated that the "V" in V6 also stood for "Versus" (20th Century [[wikt:versus|versus]] Coming Century) at first. However, then-president [[Johnny Kitagawa]] informed the group that the "V" had multiple meanings, such as "Volleyball", "Vegetable" (as Sakamoto's parents own a green grocers), "Bicycle" ("V" and "B" are indistinguishable in Japanese; Nagano's parents own a cycling store) and "Veteran".<ref>{{cite interview|title=Interview with Downtown|last=KAT-TUN|subject-link=KAT-TUN|interviewer=[[Downtown (owarai)|Downtown]]|work=[[Hey! Hey! Hey! Music Champ]]|date=2006-04-03|language=ja}}</ref>

===1995–2021===
From 1997 to 2008, V6 hosted their own variety show {{nihongo|''Gakkō e Ikō''|学校へ行こう|Let's Go to School}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokyograph.com/news/id-3544|title=Class is over for "Gakkou e Ikou!"|date=2008-07-21|publisher=Tokyograph|access-date=2009-12-20}}</ref> and is hosting ''Viva Viva V6'' since 2001 on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwz.fujitv.co.jp/vvv6/index.html|title=VVV6|publisher=[[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]]|access-date=2010-02-07|language=ja|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127135228/http://wwwz.fujitv.co.jp/vvv6/index.html|archive-date=2010-01-27}}</ref> Along with their group shows, the members also have individual TV shows, dramas or radio programs.

V6 celebrated their tenth anniversary in 2005, commemorating the event by holding about thirty [[concerts]] in sold-out arenas all over Japan, holding 3 major "Thank You Events", releasing the movie ''Hold Up Down'' and releasing ''Musicmind'' as their new album.  They also had a rare "Handshake Session" with hundreds of thousands of fans in Tokyo, [[Nagoya]], [[Osaka]] and [[Fukuoka, Fukuoka|Fukuoka]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.johnnys-net.jp/j/artists/v6/bio/bio05.html|title=V6's 2005 Timeline|publisher=Johnny's net|access-date=2010-02-07|language=ja}}</ref>

As separate bands, both of them performed the opening song for the anime, ''[[Eyeshield 21]]''. Coming Century performed "Breakthrough", the first opening theme song and 20th Century performed "Innocence", the second opening theme song. As V6, they performed "Chain of Power" as an insert song. They also sang "[[Change the World (V6 song)|Change the World]]" and "Brand New World", the 1st opening and 8th ending themes, respectively of the popular anime ''[[InuYasha]]'', as well as "Break Out", the 18th opening song of popular anime ''[[Fairy Tail]]''. They later performed the 21st opening song of ''[[One Piece]]'', "Super Powers".

On May 3, 2017, they released the double A-side single titled "COLORS/Taiyou to Tsuki no Kodomotachi". The title track "COLORS" will be used as the theme song for member Yoshihiko Inohara's starring drama "Keishicho Sousa Ikka 9 Gakari season12" on TV Asahi. Meanwhile, "Taiyou to Tsuki no Kodomotachi" has been picked up for NHK's "Minna no Uta" for April and May.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.tokyohive.com/article/2017/03/v6-to-release-double-a-side-single-in-may|title= V6 to release double A-side single in May|date=March 28, 2017|access-date=April 1, 2021|work= tokyohive|publisher= 6Theory Media, LLC.}}</ref>
