'''Garrett Davis''' (September 10, 1801 – September 22, 1872) was a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Kentucky]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Mount Sterling, Kentucky]], Garrett Davis was the brother of [[Amos Davis]]. After completing preparatory studies, Davis was employed in the office of the [[county clerk]] of [[Montgomery County, Kentucky]], and afterward of [[Bourbon County, Kentucky]]. He studied law, and, after being admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] in 1823, pursued the private practice of law in [[Paris, Kentucky]].

==Political career==
Davis served in the [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] from 1833 to 1835. Afterward, he was elected as a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]], serving from March 4, 1839, to March 3, 1847. There he was chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Territories|Committee on Territories]].

Davis declined to be a candidate for reelection in 1846, but instead resumed the practice of law and also engaged in agricultural pursuits. He refused to reenter politics the next fifteen years. Davis declined the nomination for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky]] in 1848 and declined the [[Know Nothing|American Party]] nomination for [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] in 1855 and for the presidency in 1856.

Davis was opposed to [[American Civil War|secession]], however, and supported the [[Constitutional Union Party (United States)|Constitutional Union Party]] ticket of [[John Bell (Tennessee politician)|John Bell]] and [[Edward Everett]] in the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]]. This convinced him to reenter politics, and he was elected to the U.S. Senate as a [[Unionist Party (United States)|Unionist]] by the [[Kentucky General Assembly]] in a [[1860 and 1861 United States Senate elections|December 1861 special election]] to fill the vacancy caused by the expulsion of [[John C. Breckinridge]] for supporting the Confederacy. He was reelected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in [[1860 and 1861 United States Senate elections|1867]]. At the time of his death he was chairman of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Private Land Claims|Committee on Private Land Claims]] (during the [[42nd United States Congress|42nd Congress]]).

==Personal life==
Davis was married twice, first to Rebecca Trimble, the daughter of [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] [[Robert Trimble]], and then to Eliza J. Elliott. He was the father of four children: Rebecca, Robert, Carrie and Garrett.<ref name=Paris-Bourbon>{{cite web| title=Garrett Davis| url=https://www.hopewellmuseum.org/learn/historic-preservation/bourbon-county-historical-markers/garrett-davis/| website=hopewellmuseum.org| publisher=Hopewell Museum| location=Paris, Kentucky| access-date=September 10, 2019}}</ref>
