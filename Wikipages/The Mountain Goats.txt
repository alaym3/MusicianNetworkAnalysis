'''The Mountain Goats''' are an American band formed in [[Claremont, California]], by singer-songwriter [[John Darnielle]]. The band is currently based in [[Durham, North Carolina]]. For many years, the sole member of the Mountain Goats was Darnielle, despite the plural moniker. Although he remains the core member of the band, he has worked with a variety of collaborators over time, including bassist and vocalist [[Peter Hughes (musician)|Peter Hughes]], drummer [[Jon Wurster]], multi-instrumentalist Matt Douglas, singer-songwriter [[Franklin Bruno]], bassist and vocalist Rachel Ware, singer-songwriter/[[Record producer|producer]] [[John Vanderslice]], guitarist [[Kaki King]], and multi-instrumentalist [[St. Vincent (musician)|Annie Clark]].<ref name="tmg_bio">{{cite web| title = The Mountain Goats Bio| website = Mountain-goats.com| url = http://www.mountain-goats.com/bio.html| access-date = June 7, 2013| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130707093335/http://www.mountain-goats.com/bio.html| archive-date = July 7, 2013}}</ref>

Throughout the 1990s, the Mountain Goats were known for producing [[Lo-fi music|low-fidelity]] [[home recording]]s (most notably, on a [[cassette deck]] [[boombox]]) and releasing recordings in [[Compact Cassette|cassette]] or [[7-inch single|vinyl 7-inch]] formats.<ref name="am_bio">{{cite web| last = Nickey| first = Jason| title = The Mountain Goats: Biography| work = [[Allmusic]] | publisher = [[Macrovision Corporation]]| year = 2008 | url = {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p169495|pure_url=yes}}| access-date = February 16, 2009}}</ref>  Since 2002, the Mountain Goats have adopted a more polished approach, often recording studio albums with a full band.<ref name= am_bio /><ref name="4ad">{{cite web|url=http://4ad.com/artists/themountaingoats |title=The Mountain Goats |publisher=4AD |access-date=December 26, 2011}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
The band's name is a reference to the [[Screamin' Jay Hawkins]] song "Yellow Coat".<ref name="am_bio" /> Darnielle released his first recording as the Mountain Goats (''[[Taboo VI: The Homecoming]]'', on [[Shrimper Records]]) in 1991.<ref name="am_bio" /> Many of his first recordings and performances featured Darnielle accompanied by members of the all-girl reggae band the Casual Girls, who became known as the Bright Mountain Choir. One of this group's members, Rachel Ware, continued to accompany Darnielle on bass, both live and in studio, until 1995.<ref name="tmgn_faq">{{cite web|url=http://www.themountaingoats.net/faq.html|title=the Mountain Goats FAQ|website=Themountaingoats.net|access-date=February 16, 2009}}</ref>

The first five years of the Mountain Goats' career saw a prolific output of songs on cassette, vinyl and CD. These releases spanned multiple labels and countries of origin, often released in limited numbers. The focus of the Mountain Goats project was the urgency of writing.<ref>Brown, "Sermon on the Mount", June 1999.</ref> Songs not recorded adequately to tape within days of being written were often forgotten.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} Cassette releases during this time include ''The Hound Chronicles'', ''Transmissions to Horace'', ''Hot Garden Stomp'', ''Taking the Dative'', and ''Yam, the King of Crops''.

In 1994, the Mountain Goats released their first full-length [[studio album]], ''[[Zopilote Machine]]'', on [[Ajax Records]]. It is the band's only full album featuring the entirety of the Bright Mountain Choir.

===1995–2000: ''Sweden'', ''Nothing for Juice'', ''Full Force Galesburg'', and ''The Coroner's Gambit''===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
[[File:Peter_hughes_9_23_07.jpg|thumb|[[Peter Hughes (musician)|Peter Hughes]] in 2007]]By 1995, most of what could be considered classic Mountain Goats conventions (boom-box recording, song series, Latin quotes, and mythological themes) were abandoned in favor of a more thematically focused and experimental sound.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} This period was marked by Darnielle's collaborations with other artists including [[Alastair Galbraith (musician)|Alastair Galbraith]] and [[Simon Joyner]]. In November 1996, Darnielle announced a vow to "clear his musical tendency for profanity" to promote a more optimistic reception to the ideas outlined in his material.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

In 1995, the album ''[[Sweden (album)|Sweden]]'' was released. Soon after its recording, a sequel titled ''[[Hail and Farewell, Gothenburg]]'' was recorded, but never released. It remained unheard by the general public until 2007, when it was leaked against Darnielle's wishes. In 1996, the Mountain Goats released the album ''[[Nothing for Juice]]'', and ''[[Full Force Galesburg]]'' the following year. Rachel Ware left the band between recording the two albums, and bassist [[Peter Hughes (musician)|Peter Hughes]] took over her position.

Between 1998 and 2000, the Mountain Goats slowed down their prolific output, releasing ''[[The Coroner's Gambit]]'' in October 2000. The album partially returned to the band's roots, as most songs were sporadically recorded on Darnielle's old [[Panasonic]] RX-FT500 [[cassette deck]] [[Boombox]], which produced a loud background noise to the songs.

===2001–03: ''All Hail West Texas'' and ''Tallahassee''===
2002 saw the release of two Mountain Goats albums: ''[[All Hail West Texas]]'' and ''[[Tallahassee (album)|Tallahassee]]''. These albums mark a distinct change in focus for the Mountain Goats project, being the first in a series of concept albums that explore aspects of The Mountain Goats' canon in depth. ''All Hail West Texas'' featured the resurrection of Darnielle's early boom box recording for a complete album. Darnielle considers this album to be the culmination of his lo-fi recording style. ''Tallahassee'', recorded with a band and in a studio, explores and concludes the relationship of a couple whose lives were the subject of the song cycle known as the Alpha Series.

Also released that year was ''[[Martial Arts Weekend]]'', attributed to [[The Extra Glenns]], a collaboration with [[Franklin Bruno]] on several previously unreleased Mountain Goats songs.<ref name="tmgn_faq" /> Following that recording, Bruno joined Darnielle in the studio along with bassist [[Peter Hughes (musician)|Peter Hughes]], who is the second official member of the band and accompanies Darnielle on tour. These three musicians formed what was considered the Mountain Goats studio band.

===2004–09: 4AD years===
[[File:John_Vanderslice.jpg|left|thumb|[[Record producer]] [[John Vanderslice]] in 2006]]In 2004, the Mountain Goats released ''[[We Shall All Be Healed]]''. The album marked a number of changes for the Mountain Goats, as it was the first time Darnielle worked with producer [[John Vanderslice]], and the first album of directly autobiographical material. ''We Shall All Be Healed'' chronicles Darnielle's life with a group of friends and acquaintances addicted to [[methamphetamine]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], though the album is set in [[Pomona, California]]. The following year, the band's second Vanderslice-produced album, ''[[The Sunset Tree]]'', was released. Again autobiographical, Darnielle tackled the subject of his early childhood spent with an abusive stepfather.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Monger |first1=James Christopher |title=The Sunset Tree – The Mountain Goats review |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-sunset-tree-mw0000450781 |website=AllMusic.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Stosuy |first1=Brandon |title=The Sunset Tree album review Pitchfork |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/5456-the-sunset-tree/ |website=pitchfork.com}}</ref> Darnielle had previously dealt with this subject in what he often refers to as the only autobiographical song he had written before 2004, the unreleased song "You're in Maya." The Mountain Goats relocated to [[Durham, North Carolina]] in 2006, and issued ''[[Get Lonely]]'', which was produced by [[Scott Solter]], who had worked with Vanderslice on engineering for prior Mountain Goats records.

[[Jon Wurster]] joined the group in 2007, playing drums on the last leg of the ''Get Lonely'' tour. The band recorded tracks for its next album at Prairie Sun studios.<ref>[http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=9022]{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref> Entitled ''[[Heretic Pride]]'', the album was released on 19 February 2008.<ref name="tmg_hh">{{cite web|url=http://www.mountain-goats.com/archives/2007/11/high-heresy-1.html|title=News Archive &#124; High Heresy|date=November 20, 2007|publisher=The Mountain Goats|access-date=December 26, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306040720/http://www.mountain-goats.com/archives/2007/11/high-heresy-1.html|archive-date=2012-03-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> Produced by John Vanderslice and Scott Solter, the album saw Darnielle, Hughes, and Wurster joined by Franklin Bruno, Erik Friedlander, [[St. Vincent (musician)|Annie Clark]] (better known by her stage name, St. Vincent), and members of The Bright Mountain Choir.<ref name="tmg_hh" /> American [[Alternative hip hop]] artist [[Aesop Rock]] released a remix of the track "[[Lovecraft in Brooklyn]]" from the album, and in return Darnielle contributed vocals to his album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'', in the song "Coffee".

In 2009, Darnielle and Vanderslice collaborated on the record ''[[Moon Colony Bloodbath]]''. Released in a limited vinyl run of 1000 and sold during their "Gone Primitive" tour, the EP was a concept record about [[organ harvesting]] colonies on the [[Moon]]. This was followed by the next full Mountain Goats album, ''[[The Life of the World to Come (album)|The Life of the World to Come]]'', which released in October of the same year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/36406-john-darnielle-tells-the-story-behind-the-mountain-goats-biblical-new-lp/|title=John Darnielle Tells the Story Behind the Mountain Goats' Biblical New LP|date=September 8, 2009|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|access-date=October 7, 2009}}</ref> The album is composed of twelve tracks, each one inspired by (and titled after) a single verse of the Christian [[Bible]]. In publicizing the record, the band made their first ever television appearance, performing "Psalms 40:2" on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', hosted by professed Mountain Goats fan [[Stephen Colbert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/36726-watch-the-mountain-goats-on-colbert/|date=October 7, 2009|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|title=Watch the Mountain Goats on "Colbert"|access-date=December 8, 2017}}</ref>

In January 2017, the Mountain Goats recorded a humorous song per request of director [[Rian Johnson]], depicting an alternate story of his upcoming movie, ''[[Star Wars: The Last Jedi]]''.

In January 2019, the band announced the April 26 release of their ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' inspired album, ''[[In League with Dragons]]'' (and released initial single, "Younger"), via Merge Records. The announcement was accompanied by a live music stream from the [[Wizards of the Coast]] headquarters.<ref name="RS">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/mountain-goats-new-album-in-league-with-dragons-785365/ |title=Mountain Goats Create ‘Dragon Noir’ Genre With New Album ‘In League With Dragons’|last=Kreps |first=Daniel |date=28 January 2019 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |access-date=29 January 2019}}</ref>

In March 2020, while the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] left the band unable to tour, Darnielle retrieved his old Panasonic RX-FT500 tape deck and recorded 10 new songs, using the direct-to-boombox method for the first time since 2002's ''All Hail West Texas''. The resulting album, entitled ''[[Songs for Pierre Chuvin]]'', was inspired by Darnielle's reading of [[Pierre Chuvin]]'s 1990 book ''A Chronicle of the Last Pagans'', and was released digitally on April 10, 2020, with a limited physical release on cassette through Merge Records.<ref>{{cite web |title=Songs for Pierre Chuvin |last=Darnielle |first=John | website=Bandcamp |url=https://themountaingoats.bandcamp.com/album/songs-for-pierre-chuvin |access-date=April 10, 2020 | date=April 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |website=Merge Records |title=the Mountain Goats - Songs for Pierre Chuvin |url=https://www.mergerecords.com/songs-for-pierre-chuvin |access-date=April 10, 2020 |date=April 10, 2020}}</ref>
