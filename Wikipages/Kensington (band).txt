== Biography ==
=== Early years (2005–2008) ===
Kensington was formed in 2005 at a secondary school in [[Zeist]], Jordan MLU, by singer/guitarist Casper Starreveld, bass player Jan Haker, and drummer Lucas Lenselink. Singer/guitarist Eloi Youssef joined the band in 2006. Kensington's first official releases appeared in 2007 on Stuck in a Day Records: the two-song promo single ''An Introduction To...'' and the five-song ''Kensington EP''. This self-produced EP was recorded in the Second Moon Studio of Dutch folk singer Hessel van der Kooij, on the island of [[Terschelling]], and was mixed and mastered by Martijn Groeneveld in the Mailmen Studios in [[Utrecht]].<ref>http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/interviews/26039/kensington-over-de-britse-kant-hessel-koorzang-radar.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111219135248/http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/interviews/26039/kensington-over-de-britse-kant-hessel-koorzang-radar.html |date=December 19, 2011 }}</ref>
The ''Kensington EP'' received good reviews, including from Dutch music platform MusicFromNL, which showered it with praise. "The band effortlessly combines different styles and moods into a comprehensive sound. (...) The quartet from Utrecht show musical sophistication on this debut. These five songs exhibit Kensington's prowess, originality and musicality. It is a well-produced, diverse and catchy record."<ref>http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/recensies/25878/kensington-kensington.html  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102021307/http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/recensies/25878/kensington-kensington.html |date=January 2, 2010 }}</ref> The band played several shows in 2007 with Dutch touring showcase festival the Popronde,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.proculture.nl/news/59/Kensington_opgenomen_in_Popronde_2007/|title = ProCulture - Nieuws - Kensington opgenomen in Popronde 2007}}</ref> and as support for bands such as American indie rock band Movies With Heroes.

At the end of 2007, drummer Lucas Lenselink decided to leave the band. Lenselink felt that his own ambitions did not match those of his bandmates anymore. He explained that a career in music was not what he had envisioned for himself and that he wanted to focus on finishing his studies at university.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/utrecht/nieuws/2008/januari/drummer-kensington-stapt-op.html |title=Drummer Kensington stapt op "Ik kon me niet vinden in de ambities van de rest" |publisher=3voor12 |first=Casper |last=Sikkema |language=Dutch |date=4 January 2008 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref> After auditioning a couple of new drummers, Niles Vandenberg, former drummer of Griffin, joined Kensington in February 2008. Niles does share the ambitions of the rest of the band and is seen as "a great addition".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/27733/kensington-met-nieuwe-drummer-op-stuck-in-a-day-festival.html |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |title=KENSINGTON MET NIEUWE DRUMMER OP STUCK IN A DAY-FESTIVAL |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903003328/http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/27733/kensington-met-nieuwe-drummer-op-stuck-in-a-day-festival.html |archivedate=September 3, 2010 }}</ref>

Together with Niles, the band started working on their second EP. The record, titled ''Youth'', was released on 12 December 2008 on Dutch indie label [[Snowstar Records]]. ''Youth'' received positive reviews from MusicFromNL, amongst others, which praised the inventiveness of the song structures and the professional-sounding production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/recensies/30666/kensington-youth.html |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425113433/http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/recensies/30666/kensington-youth.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}</ref>
''Youth EP'' generated attention from several record labels and the band eventually signed with [[EMI|Bladehammer/EMI]], a label that shares the band's high ambitions.<ref>http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/31125/kensington-tekent-bij-bladehammer-sony-atv.html {{dead link|date=February 2015}}</ref>

=== ''Borders'' (2009–2011) ===
In the summer of 2009, Kensington traveled to [[Leeds]] to start work on their first full-length album with producer James Kenosha, in the studio of [[Kaiser Chiefs]]' [[keyboardist]] [[Nicholas M. Baines|Nick Baines]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/32619/kensington-doet-verslag-van-opnameproces-in-leeds.html |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100419041414/http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/32619/kensington-doet-verslag-van-opnameproces-in-leeds.html |archivedate=April 19, 2010 }}</ref> The album, titled ''Borders'', came out on July 17, 2010.

The latter chose to focus on playing guitar and singing backing vocals.
The band spent the rest of 2010 touring the Netherlands with [[pop punk]] band MakeBelieve and several supporting acts.<ref name="3voor12 headlinetour">{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/utrecht/nieuws/2010/oktober/eerste-headlinetour-ambitieuze-kensington-begin-2011.html |title=Eerste headlinetour ambitieuze Kensington begin 2011 |publisher=3voor12 |first=Linda |last=Van Houwelingen |language=Dutch |date=13 October 2010 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>
The second single to come off ''Borders'', "When It All Falls Down", was released in November of that year.

In January 2011, Kensington performed on the showcase festival [[Eurosonic Noorderslag]], where the band was noticed by promoters from Dutch prime time TV show ''[[De Wereld Draait Door]]''. On January 19, the band appeared on the show to play their single "Youth".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dewerelddraaitdoor.vara.nl/media/69062|title=De minuut: Kensington - Youth - 19-01-2011 - de Wereld Draait Door - BNNVARA}}</ref> In February the band set out on its first tour as main headliner, the No Borders Tour.<ref name="3voor12 headlinetour"/> The tour was a success, with sold-out shows in [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso Amsterdam]], [[Tivoli (Utrecht)|Tivoli Utrecht]], and Rotown [[Rotterdam]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.utrecht-roxx.nl/?p=471|title=Untitled}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/zuid-holland/nieuws/rotterdam/2011/maart/kensington-toont-internationale-klasse-in-een-uitverkocht-rotown.html |title=Kensington toont internationale klasse in een uitverkocht Rotown |first=Marlou |last=Van der Linden |publisher=3voor12 |language=Dutch |date=15 March 2011 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}</ref>

Another eight shows were added when the single "Let Go" came out in March 2011. "Let Go" was a new song which hadn't been included on the initial release of ''Borders'', but was added to an April 2011 re-release of the album in [[Digipak]] format. "Let Go" was chosen as 3FM's Megahit for the second week of April, which meant that the radio station gave the track extra airplay.<ref>http://www.3fm.nl/playlists/megahit</ref> For the "Let Go" tour, the band played venues such as [[013]] Tilburg and in the main hall of [[Paradiso (Amsterdam)|Paradiso Amsterdam]] as support for English pop group [[Scouting For Girls]]. Reviews for the shows were good, and Kensington established itself as a solid live band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/noord-holland/nieuws/2011/mei/heeft-er-iemand-nog-een-paar-drumstokken.html |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205000838/http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/noord-holland/nieuws/2011/mei/heeft-er-iemand-nog-een-paar-drumstokken.html |archivedate=February 5, 2015 }}</ref>

In the summer of 2011, a great majority of [[Kink FM]] listeners voted for Kensington to become 'National Festival Ambassador of 2011'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEyED3X6ho4 |title=Kensington is Nationale Festival Ambassadeur 2011 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/37466/kensington-verwerft-titel-nationale-festivalambassadeur.html |accessdate=June 10, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807002956/http://www.musicfrom.nl/magazine/nieuws/37466/kensington-verwerft-titel-nationale-festivalambassadeur.html |archivedate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref> This title included a slot on Serbia's [[EXIT Festival]], one of the larger European summer festivals.

In early November, they were invited to [[New York City]], where they did some promotional work for Zip Records and played a show in the Cutting Room, a music venue in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dutchperformingarts.com/music/2011/08/22/upcoming-zip-records-presents-kensington-birgit-schuurman-and-nicole-bus/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120727234802/http://www.dutchperformingarts.com/music/2011/08/22/upcoming-zip-records-presents-kensington-birgit-schuurman-and-nicole-bus/ |archivedate=2012-07-27 }}</ref> The band also did some radio interviews for college radio stations "The Atlantic Tunnel" and "East Village Radio",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.3fm.nl/nieuws/detail/351437/Blog-4:-Kensington-op-promotour-in-VS |title=Blog 4: Kensington op promotour in VS |publisher=[[NPO 3FM]] |date=2 November 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531204241/http://www.3fm.nl/nieuws/detail/351437/Blog-4%3A-Kensington-op-promotour-in-VS |archive-date=31 May 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and appeared in Cognac Wellerlane's TV show ''The Long Island Exchange''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlIPh4I2Jgw |title=The cutting room interviews.mpg |publisher=[[YouTube]] |accessdate=24 January 2015}}</ref> In December, Kensington were back in the Netherlands for a couple of shows where they premiered songs from their new album.

=== ''Vultures'' (2012–2013) ===
Kensington used the first months of 2012 to perfect their second album, ''Vultures''. The band had planned a tour in February and March but postponed it until April, so as to be able to work on the songs some more, and to give their fans the chance to listen to the album before the start of the tour. Eventually, it proved to be impossible to release the album before the start of the tour, but the band organized some dressing room listening sessions for a select group of fans, who got the chance to hear some of the album tracks before everyone else. The band took advantage of the all but sold 
-out shows in [[Effenaar]] Eindhoven, Hedon Zwolle, [[Tivoli (Utrecht)|Tivoli]] Utrecht, and [[Melkweg]] Amsterdam to test-run the new material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/amsterdam/nieuws/2012/april/Kensington-Melkweg.html |accessdate=June 23, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120510235249/http://3voor12.vpro.nl/lokaal/amsterdam/nieuws/2012/april/Kensington-Melkweg.html |archivedate=May 10, 2012 }}</ref>
