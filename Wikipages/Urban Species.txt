'''Urban Species''' is a British [[hip-hop]] band, best known for several [[hit single]]s during the 1990s. The band's music draws on a diverse range of influences (including [[reggae]], [[blues]], [[funk]], [[Dub music|dub]], [[jazz]], [[ragga]] and acoustic [[folk music|folk]]) and combines live playing with samples and programming, resulting in an organic sound that has sometimes been compared to a British version of [[Arrested Development (band)|Arrested Development]].<ref>[https://www.nme.com/artists/urban-species NME.com entry for Urban Species]. Retrieved 17 August 2009</ref> The band's music is frequently associated with the [[acid jazz]] movement of the mid-1990s.

Urban Species' consistent core figure and effective leader has been Peter "Mintos" Akinrinlola, but the band's line-up has at various times included other producers and rappers plus many of the best musicians from the London funk and jazz-funk scenes. The band is also known for collaborations, most notably with [[Terry Callier]] and [[Imogen Heap]].

==History==
===Prehistory (MC Mint and Renegade)===
The band was founded in [[Tottenham]], [[North London]], England, by childhood friends Peter Akinrinlola (who took on the rapper's name of "MC Mint", later revising it to "Mintos") and Winston Small (who provided beats under the name "DJ Renegade").<ref name="Larkin90">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Nineties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2000|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0427-8|page=409}}</ref> Growing up in the 1980s, both shared an interest in various underground music including [[hip-hop]] (which at the time was restricted mainly to its [[Electro (music)|electro]] and [[Rapping|rap]] subdivisions), dancehall [[reggae]], [[rave music|rave]] and [[blues]]. The duo began writing together in 1988. For sampleable material, they drew extensively on the stock of jazz and funk records owned by Renegade's older brother, which came to shape their organic, live-sounding musical approach.

Under the MC Mint & DJ Renegade name, the duo recorded their first white-label release – "It's My Thing" – in 1989. The disc became an underground and pirate radio hit in the UK and also came to the attention of two high-profile New York radio stations (Kiss and WBLS) who eventually put the track into frequent rotation.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

Inspired by this initial success (which, as an unsigned act without commercial backing, they were unable to immediately follow up), Mintos and Renegade eventually produced a second self-funded and distributed single called "Got To Have It".<ref name="Larkin90"/> This attracted the interest of British DJ [[Gilles Peterson]], a champion of new black British music who was also the owner of the [[Phonogram Records]] subsidiary [[Talkin' Loud]]<ref name="Larkin90"/> (the label for acts including [[Incognito (band)|Incognito]], [[Omar Lye-Fook]], [[Young Disciples]] and [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]]). Talkin' Loud eventually signed Mintos and Renegade in 1992 under the new project name of Urban Species.<ref name="Larkin90"/>

===1992–1993 – Urban Species develop their profile===
The first formal Urban Species track to be released was "Hide And Seek" (which appeared on the ''Talking Loud Sampler Volume 2'' compilation). Shortly afterwards, Urban Species expanded from a core duo to a trio with the addition of a second rapper, Doc Slim (real name Rodney Green). Slim was one of Mintos' and Renegade's old school friends, and had an MC delivery inspired by [[ragga]]-style [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] and street humour. For live appearances, Urban Species drew on a pool of live funk musicians (including drummer Andrew Missingham, bass player Yolanda Charles and guitarist Nemo Jones, as well as members of [[Incognito (band)|Incognito]] and [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]]) to ensure that they delivered full-fledged musical shows instead of DAT-based PA performances.<ref name="Larkin90"/> As a consequence – and following well-received support slots for [[MC Solaar]], [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]]'s [[Jazzmatazz]] project and the [[Stereo MCs]] – the band developed a strong live reputation and soon attained headline-act status.

===1994 – ''Listen''===
Urban Species released their debut album – ''Listen'' – in May 1994.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The band had extended the musicality of their concerts to their recording sessions, incorporating live instruments alongside the samples and programming, and going for a spacious, organic feel to the album atmospheres. ''Listen'' included the earlier single "Gotta Have It" as well as "Hide And Seek". It also produced three more singles – the title track (featuring singer Chezeré), "Spiritual Love" and "Brother". The latter two were hits, and the album received wide critical acclaim.

Over the next eighteen months, the band continued to develop their profile. They became successful in continental Europe (particularly in France) and maintained their inroads into the US via New York, where they had developed an underground following considerable airplay and an acclaimed performance at the 1994 New Music Seminar. Aiming for a truly international approach, the band also toured the Far East and Africa, where they continued to befriend other musicians and educate themselves.

===1995–1997 – line-up and direction changes===
As the success of Urban Species grew, Mintos became the dominant force in the band. This in turn caused friction between him and Renegade, who was also finding the rigours of touring to be difficult. Not without regret, Renegade opted to leave Urban Species in 1995. He would subsequently follow a career as a hip-hop/R'n’B producer with Dub Wise Productions.

With Mintos now in overall charge of the project, Urban Species began to move towards a more collective approach (similar to that of their contemporaries [[Massive Attack]]) in which the group's core membership was less important than the opportunities offered by collaboration. In 1997, the band began recording material for a second album, ''Blanket''.<ref name="Larkin90"/> The first sign of a new approach came with the 1997 EP ''Religion and Politics''. The two songs featured on the EP (the title track and 'Changing of the Guard') were both collaborations with 1960s American jazz-folk-soul singer [[Terry Callier]],<ref name="Larkin90"/> whose career had recently been reinvigorated in the UK by the interest of the acid-jazz community.

===1998–1999 – ''Blanket''===
Further album sessions followed, with the assistance of new producer Raw Deal. During this period, Doc Slim was replaced in the band (both in the studio and onstage) by a new MC called Tukka Yout. Mintos also invited contributions from various other artists outside the Urban Species core.  These included veteran British rappers [[Blak Twang]] and [[MC Mell'O']], plus singers Elizabeth Troy, Jeffery Darnell (a fellow Talkin' Loud signing), future [[house music|house]] star [[MJ Cole]] and singer-songwriter [[Imogen Heap]].

Due to Urban Species' higher European profile, ''Blanket'' was originally released in continental Europe in late 1998, without a UK release until the following year. However, the album was similarly successful to ''Listen''  and received similar critical acclaim. As well as incorporating the collaborations with Terry Callier, the album produced two singles – the title track (co-written by and featuring Imogen Heap) and "Woman".

===2000–2008 – hiatus===
Following the release and promotion of ''Blanket'', Urban Species released no new material bar occasional remixes. In the early 2000s, Mintos put Urban Species on indefinite hold to concentrate on family life and other projects. During this period he wrote material for [[S Club 7]], [[The Freestylers]] and [[LHB (band)|LHB]] as well as various unspecified "unsigned talent". He also developed a career outside music as an entrepreneur, starting up an Overseas Property company as well as an organic coffee business.

===2008–present – reunion===
On 6 December 2008, Mintos announced an Urban Species reunion via his MySpace blog. He commented "My break from music went on for a lot longer than I intended. I kept saying  'yeah, this year... this year... this year...' and before I knew it six years flew by. But nothing before its time, I always say. I got my groove, passion and hunger back plus I got a lot of things to say." Mintos' two main creative foils in the reunion appear to be Doc Slim and ''Blanket'' producer Raw Deal, with whom he is recording a third Urban Species album.<ref name="blogs.myspace.com">[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=430851751&blogId=454418316 "My first blog – a heads-up from Mintos"] – posting on Urban Species MySpace page by Mintos, 6 December 2008 (accessed 17 August 2009)</ref>

The band are also intending to carry out a reunion tour featuring various former Talkin' Loud colleagues, about which Mintos has commented "I spoke to [[Omar Lye-Fook|Omar]] and (he) likes the idea. [[Jean-Paul 'Bluey' Maunick|Bluey]] from the [[Incognito (band)|Incognito]] is said to be down and he's gonna speak to [[Carleen Anderson]] from the ([[Young Disciples]]). I did speak to Rob from [[Galliano (band)|Galliano]] and he's like 'err, I don't know' so we'll see."<ref name="blogs.myspace.com"/>
