'''Webkinz''' are [[stuffed animals]] that have two playable online counterparts, "'''Webkinz Classic'''" and "'''Webkinz'''".<ref>{{Cite web|title=All-New Webkinz FAQ {{!}} WKN: Webkinz Newz|url=https://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/all-new-webkinz-faq/|access-date=2021-06-24|website=webkinznewz.ganzworld.com}}</ref> Webkinz were originally released by the Canadian toy company [[Ganz (toy company)|Ganz]] on April 29, 2005. The toys are similar to many other small plush toys; however, each Webkinz toy has an attached tag with a unique "Secret Code" printed on it that allows its owner to play with their pet in the "Webkinz Classic" game for [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], and desktop computer. Webkinz plush toys sold after October 2020 contain two Secret Codes, one 8-digit code compatible with "Webkinz Classic" and one 15-digit code compatible with "Webkinz." On Webkinz World, the Secret Code allows the user to own a [[digital pet|virtual version]] of the pet for online play. Many collections of Webkinz were sold, such as Lil' Kinz (smaller, less expensive versions of Webkinz), and the Signature collection (larger, higher-quality, and slightly more expensive Webkinz). There is also a spin-off, Webkinz Jr.; which is aimed at children ages 3-6. Sales of plush Webkinz toys are limited to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], but international users can buy virtual pets from the online eStore.<ref name="Webkinz eStore">[http://www.webkinzestore.com Webkinz eStore]</ref> In 2006, Webkinz had one million online accounts, and according to one estimate published in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' they made $100 million in 2006.<ref name="wired">{{cite news |url=https://www.wired.com/gadgets/miscellaneous/news/2007/07/webkinz?currentPage=all |title=How to Take Money From Kids: Sell Toys Both Physical and Virtual |date=August 13, 2007 |work=Wired |access-date=September 19, 2010}}</ref> In 2011, Webkinz made its first commercial on TV. Webkinz was updated in 2015 to Webkinz X, making it more kid-friendly. In October 2020, Webkinz unveiled a new logo, introduced babies and began to transition to a 3D version with more social features.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Join the Family {{!}} WKN: Webkinz Newz|url=https://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/join-the-family/|access-date=2020-11-23|website=webkinznewz.ganzworld.com}}</ref>

== Types of Webkinz==
There are many types of Webkinz: regular pets, wild animals, mythical creatures, and made-up ones. They all come with codes that can be entered on the computer or phone on each downloadable game. Along with the regular Webkinz toys, there are also smaller, less expensive versions called Lil' Kinz, as well as larger, slightly more expensive versions in the Signature collection launched in April 2009. The Signature collection later ended in December 2013. In May 2009, Birthstone Pets were released. One new Birthstone Pet was released for every month. In April 2010, Ganz replaced the Birthstone Pets with the Zodiac Pets. Again, one Zodiac Pet was released every month. In 2011, CandyKinz were released. In June 2012, Rockerz Pets were released. In 2019, Ganz announced that no new plush pets would be released, but purely virtual pets can still be purchased, accounts can be made, and the website still operates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/official-statement-on-the-future-of-webkinz-plush-toys/|title=Official Statement on the Future of Webkinz Plush Toys {{!}} WKN: Webkinz Newz|language=en-US|access-date=2019-09-06}}</ref> In November 2020, two new Webkinz pets were released, starting a new "generation" of pets. These new plus included two codes, one for Webkinz Classic, and Webkinz, and are only available to purchase online.<ref>{{Cite web|title=They're Here! All-New Webkinz Plush Toys! {{!}} WKN: Webkinz Newz|url=https://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/allnewplush/|access-date=2021-05-23|website=webkinznewz.ganzworld.com}}</ref>

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Webkinz Logo.svg|left|thumb|Webkinz logo used from April 29, 2005 until October 24, 2020. It is still used in Webkinz Classic.]]
Each Webkinz [[stuffed animal]] and Webkinz accessory comes with an 8-character [[code]]. By registering this code on the Webkinz Classic desktop application or mobile app, the customer "[[adopt]]s" this pet in the [[virtuality|virtual]] '''Webkinz World'''. Without the code, the user will not get access to the full Webkinz World, but they can create a free account. On January 19, 2011, Ganz announced that Webkinz World accounts would no longer expire, meaning users would not have to buy a new pet each year to renew their account. However, some games, furniture, and other features are limited with a free account. Young adults who had active accounts on the website have even revisited their pets to catch up on their health as an online trend.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBgF8l08SR4</ref>

The Webkinz World is an [[online play]] area with its own [[economy]] completely controlled by Ganz. The user receives money (called '''KinzCash''') by adopting new pets, playing [[online games]], answering general knowledge questions, and through daily activities like clicking "I love my Webkinz!", spinning the ''Wheel of WOW'', playing ''Wishing Well 2'', or completing jobs (minigames) available once every 8 hours. Each day, there is a Game of the Day which can be played for bonus KinzCash, and other bonuses are available each hour, full days on weekends and afternoons only on weekdays. With each Webkinz toy purchased, more KinzCash, rooms, and items are added to the user's account.

The online world also contains many rare or exclusive items. Some of these items require developing a friendship with the Curio Shop owner to purchase, while others are obtained by registering other Webkinz accessories purchased in the real world. Each type of pet gets a special item and food available exclusively for them. Also, a Pet of the Month is announced at the beginning of each month. If a person registers the announced pet in that month, they will receive other exclusive items.

Many of the tasks in Webkinz World involve collecting items. For example, [[recipe]]s are released for the players through [[cookbook]]s or one of the TV shows called ''The Secret Chef''. "Gems" can be mined once a day at the ''Curio Shop'', with a full set of gems being turned into the ''Webkinz Crown of Wonder'' and buy exclusive items. A similar feature called ''Alyssa's Star Challenge'', involves users clicking on colored stars to find valuable stars.

Other features of Webkinz Classic include:
* The ability to create shows with the [[#Webkinz Studio|Webkinz Studio]], and enter to be chosen to appear on the Webkinz TV.
* Buying a [[swimming pool]], a trampoline, and a treadmill where Webkinz can improve their health.
* Sending gifts or letters to friends on a peer-to-peer network.
* Inviting a friend over to one's house, where users can chat and interact with each other and play games.
* Participating in the hourly events, which can earn the user prizes, KinzCash, and coupons, among other things.
* Brushing, washing, and bathing one's pet.
* Cooking and baking, in which users must combine random foods to crack secret formulas and recipes released by the site.
* Setting up a party, inviting guests, playing games and giving out loot bags. (a Party Pack costs 750 to 1000 KinzCash)
* Playing a variety of games such as gem mining.
* Trading items with other players.
* Reading virtual books exclusive to the Webkinz World.
* Enrolling one's virtual pet in school, or "The Kinzville Academy" where they can learn and develop skills to help them compete in tournaments.
* Decorating pets' home. Furniture can be purchased via the W-shop in the Webkinz World.
* Interacting with other players via the Webkinz Clubhouse, where players can play games such as "Link'd" (Similar to the board game [[Connect Four]]), Checkers, and much more.
* Shopping for clothes with one's pet.

=== Webkinz Studio ===
* The Webkinz Studio is an item used to produce shows.
* The Webkinz Studio generally costs 1000 KinzCash in the W Shop.
* There are currently 18 characters and 9 sets. One can buy more from the W Shop.
* In 2008, a very strict dictionary was added to secure the words used in the studio.
* In March 2010, Webkinz announced that the Studio had been "enhanced" with more features, including "slide transitions", the "who speaks first" option, and character entrances and exits.
* Also, the Studio can be found in the Curio Shop on a rare basis for less than 1000 KinzCash.

== Membership ==
When a pet is registered at www.webkinz.com (or "adopted"), it gives or renews an account's full membership features for one year. When the membership of a pet expires, the account becomes a free account, missing the ability to play some games, buy certain items, and do other things in the world. However, a player can renew their account again at any time.

There is also an upgrade to regular memberships called the Deluxe Membership which is available at the [http://www.ganzestore.com/estore/membership/catalog/Deluxe%20Membership?productsSize=15 Ganz eStore]. This is a premium membership with many features, benefits, games, and prizes to which regular accounts do not have access. Deluxe Members also receive free Webkinz eStore points at the time of purchase and at the beginning of each month afterward for the extent of the Deluxe Membership.

If one wants to register an account at www.webkinz.com without a pet code, they are permitted to select from 9 Ganz eStore Pets. Several limitations exist on free accounts that make many challenges and activities impossible. Free accounts can be upgraded to regular memberships or Deluxe Memberships at any time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://webkinznewz.ganzworld.com/announcements/help/|title = Homepage FAQ &#124; WKN: Webkinz Newz}}</ref>

== W-Plus & Trading Cards ==
Aside from the Webkinz, Lil' Kinz, Signature, and Rockerz Pets, Ganz also has made other toys that can be used on Webkinz World. These are called W-Plus items, and all W-Plus items come with a secret code that can be used in the Code Shop in Webkinz World. These codes unlock items for the Webkinz Pets, like new room themes, clothing for pets, KinzCash, and other prizes.

Series 3 changed the format, with only 1 feature code per pack, and no code for a virtual pack.  The packs also included stickers and a chance to win a previously unheard-of Pet, the Magical Retriever.  Also, Ganz has said that each Series 3 code gives users an item they cannot find anywhere else in Webkinz World. Series 4 has also been released, and the prize Pet, the Mystical Panda, replaces the Magical Retriever.

== Ganz eStore ==
The Ganz eStore is targeted to an older audience of the website, it can be used to purchase virtual pets, furniture and items with real currency. Sales of plush Webkinz and Lil' Kinz are limited to the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], however, virtual pets can be purchased from the Ganz eStore by international residents. Secret Codes issued in conjunction with virtual pets can be used the same way as Secret Codes attached to plush pets.<ref name="Webkinz eStore"/>

Deluxe Members get free Ganz eStore points every month.

== Webkinz games ==
Webkinz World has many games in which players can play to earn KinzCash. The application also has a wide range of multiplayer games for users to play against their friends and anyone else who wants to play at the time. There are some games specifically reserved for a premium tier of users, called Deluxe Membership.

== Criticism ==
Concerns have been raised about children's use and overuse of the toys. Parents may worry that children will become [[gaming disorder|addicted]] to the game.<ref name="ABC">{{cite web|title=Is the Webkinz Craze Bad for Kids?|publisher=[[ABC News]]|access-date=2007-04-23|date=2007-04-12|url=https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=33380}}</ref> Some parents have voiced concerns about the website's [[online chat]] system.
