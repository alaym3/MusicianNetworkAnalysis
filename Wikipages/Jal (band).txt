==History==
===Early years (1998–2001)===
[[Goher Mumtaz]] and [[Atif Aslam]] met each other while the latter was studying at the Punjab College in [[Lahore]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], Pakistan, in 1998.<ref name="Jal - Interview at The Saturday Post">[http://www.thesaturdaypost.com/rendezvous_6_jal.htm Jal the band] Retrieved on 23 June 2011</ref>

===Formation (2001–2003)===

Soon afterwards, the band started to gain popularity in Lahore's [[underground music]] scene and gained a large following due to the success of their song "[[Aadat (song)|Aadat]]". The band then went on to release the music video for the song, directed by Umer Anwar, through [[ARY Digital]] and [[The Musik]], in December 2003.<ref name="Jal - Biography"/> The video was soon rated as the fourth best video of the year 2003 by ARY The Muzik, within days of its release.<ref name="Jal - Profile"/>

However, by the end of December 2003, Atif parted ways with the band due to musical differences with lead guitarist, Goher Mumtaz, to pursue a career as a solo artist.  This led Goher to recruit musicians, [[Farhan Saeed]] on vocals and Aamir Tufail on bass guitar. Farhan was suggested by Sultan Raja, bassist of [[Call (band)|Call]], who introduced him to Goher and thus joining the band as its vocalist. By this time the band, with a new line-up, re-did the song "[[Aadat (song)|Aadat]]" as its video was already being aired on local music channels with the former lead vocalist, Atif Aslam's, voice.<ref name="Jal - Biography"/><ref name="Jal - Profile"/>

Following the release of the band's first single, Jal soon entered the recording studios to work on their début studio album release. The band had recruited bassist Aamir Tufail along with vocalist [[Farhan Saeed]], and started to work on their first album. The album was composed by Goher and was produced by  Zulfiqar Jabbar Khan and [[Mekaal Hasan]], previously produced the band's début single "Aadat" which was a major hit in both India and Pakistan. Jal then went on recording and releasing their début studio album, ''[[Aadat (Indian Edition)|Aadat]]'', through the record label Sadaf Stereo, on 27 September 2004. Mostly all singles from the album did really well at the local music charts, most notably "Aadat" which topped the charts and stayed at the top for two weeks. Whereas, five other songs from the album received [[Top 40]] airplay on radio and music channels in Pakistan. Sales of the album were such that it remained at the top of the Pakistani music charts for several weeks after its release. The album was declared as the best selling album of 2004 on [[Geo TV]] by the [[record label]] Sadaf Stereo. This was followed by the album being released in India by HOM Records. In October, Jal released their second single "Lamhay" music video, from their album, directed by Zulfiqar Jabbar Khan.<ref>[http://www.pakipop.com/reflection/woh_lamhey.html Woh Lamhey: Video Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001003553/http://www.pakipop.com/reflection/woh_lamhey.html |date=1 October 2011 }} Retrieved on 23 June 2011</ref> On 11 November, Jal went on performing at [[Lahore Grammar School|Lahore Grammar School 55-Main]] branch along with [[Call (band)|Call]].

[[Atif Aslam]], released his debut solo album ''[[Jal Pari (album)|Jal Pari]]'', after he left the band, which included few songs from Jal's first studio album. This led to a dispute between Atif and Jal about who owned the rights to the songs as Goher took the dispute to court.<ref>[http://www.pakipop.com/evaluation/jal_pari.html Jal Pari – Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001003558/http://www.pakipop.com/evaluation/jal_pari.html |date=1 October 2011 }} Retrieved on 23 June 2011</ref> However, the final statement from the court went in favour of both the artists as the songs which were included in both the artist albums were compositions of both Atif and Goher. Thus, the dispute ended between the two musicians.

The song created controversy as a remix version of the song later appeared in the Bollywood movie ''[[Zeher]]'', released in March 2005. Jal accused the film producers of [[Theft|stealing]] their song, "Lamhay". In response to this accusation, the music director for the movie, [[Anu Malik]], credited himself for only "re-creating" the song on the album, but there was still a heavily noticeable resemblance.<ref>[http://asspoof.com/index.php?/List-of-Plagiarized-Movies/qzeherq-music-copied-from-qpakistaniq-albums.html "Zeher" Music Copied from "Pakistani" Albums]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Retrieved on 23 June 2011</ref> [[Roop Kumar Rathod]] is credited as the "composer" for the song, while the original composer of the song is vocalist, lead guitarist, Goher Mumtaz, of the band.
