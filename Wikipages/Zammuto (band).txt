==History==

===The Books===
Nick Zammuto had been making critically acclaimed music starting in the year 2001 as a member of the band [[The Books]]. From 2001 through 2010, The Books released four studio albums.

The albums are ''[[Thought for Food]]'' (2002), ''[[The Lemon of Pink]]'' (2003), ''[[Lost and Safe]]'' (2005), and ''[[The Way Out (The Books album)|The Way Out]]'' (2010). The first three albums were released under the Tomlab label, and the fourth album was released under Temporary Residence LTD.<ref name="thebooksmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebooksmusic.com/|title=The Books|publisher=thebooksmusic.com|access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref> The Books also released 2 DVDs of videos, and an EP called ''[[Music for a French Elevator and Other Short Format Oddities by the Books]]'' during this time.

Upon the dissolution of his first band, Nick Zammuto stated in an interview on [[Pitchfork Media]] that "it was a scramble for me to figure out what to do next. I seriously considered just stopping music since it's such an uncertain business and hard on my family, but my wife and close friends urged me to make another record right away. It definitely had a 'do or die' kind of feeling hanging over it."<ref name="pitchfork"/>

===''Idiom Wind EP''===
While working on their first album in the year 2011, Zammuto released a three-song EP composed of songs which were to appear on their forthcoming album. This record was called the ''Idiom Wind EP'' and was released by a London-based record label called Make Mine Records.<ref name="zammutosound2">{{cite web|url=http://www.zammutosound.com/home/blog/ep-release-on-make-mine-records|title=Ep Release on Make Mine Records|publisher=zammutosound.com|access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref> It contained the songs "Idiom Wind", "F U C-3PO", and "Weird Ceiling".

===Live show and touring===
Immediately following the release of their first album, Zammuto toured extensively during 2012, playing more than 80 shows throughout the United States, Canada, and Europe. They began touring as an opening act for their label-mate, [[Explosions in the Sky]].<ref name="pitchfork3">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/45463-zammuto-join-explosions-in-the-sky-tour/|title=Zammuto Join Explosions in the Sky Tour &#124; News &#124; Pitchfork|publisher=pitchfork.com|access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref> In the fall of 2012, they began a nationwide headlining tour through North America, mixed in with a few opening acts for the Australian band [[Gotye]].<ref name="brooklynvegan">{{cite web|url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2012/05/zammuto_opening.html|title=Zammuto opening for Gotye on tour (dates)|publisher=brooklynvegan.com|access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref> They ended their intense touring in the spring of 2013 with a small North American tour with the Canadian band [[Snowblink]].<ref name="zammutosound"/>

Nick Zammuto did an interview explaining the process of preparing for their live shows. "My studio is a tractor garage that, from the outside, is just a shack but you go inside and it's state-of-the-art equipment and I love that tension. It's really funny and it's great because I have my band out from [[New York City]] and they view it as a haven. We just work with total focus and get a lot done and then we can all go back to our normal lives afterwards. It's always a beautiful moment to have them up."<ref name="thequietus">{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/08755-nick-zammuto-interview-the-books|title=The Quietus &#124; Features &#124; Escape Velocity &#124; Natural Balance: An Interview With Zammuto|publisher=thequietus.com|access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref>
