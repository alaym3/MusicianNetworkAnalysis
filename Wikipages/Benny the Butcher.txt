"I got to be careful, I got to make sure I wear my mask, I got to make sure I'm taking my medicine. Running the streets and being in and out of prison, it’s probably something I haven’t done the best of. But being older, that’s something that I take care of," Pennick wrote.<ref name=Genius>{{cite web|url=https://genius.com/21077041|title=Where Would I Go|access-date=November 15, 2021|work=Genius}}</ref>
