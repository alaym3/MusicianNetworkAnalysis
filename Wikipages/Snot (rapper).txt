Snot began his music career in 2016 while in high school, revealing to Jack Angell of ''[[Complex Networks|Complex]]'' that he "was listening to dudes like Xavier Wulf, [[Bones (rapper)|Bones]], [[Yung Lean]], [[Lil Wayne]], and [[Tyler, the Creator]]... along with Memphis artists like Shawty Pimp and the influential Memphis-based group [[Three 6 Mafia]]".

My friend Wetback Manny was already putting shit on SoundCloud and he introduced me to recording and how to use a microphone.

But then Manny got a condenser mic, so I guess I got lucky."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Meet $NOT, Florida's New Rap Anomaly|url=https://www.complex.com/pigeons-and-planes/2019/05/snot-rapper-interview|access-date=October 31, 2020|website=Complex}}</ref>
