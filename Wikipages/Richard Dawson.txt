'''Richard Dawson''' (born '''Colin Lionel Emm'''; 20 November 1932 – 2 June 2012) was an English-American actor, comedian, and game-show host and [[panel show|panelist]] in the United States. Dawson was well known for playing Corporal Peter Newkirk in ''[[Hogan's Heroes]]'', as a regular panelist on ''[[Match Game#Match Game 1973–1978; 1978 73–79 (1973–79, CBS)|Match Game]]'' (1973–1978), and as the original and third host of ''[[Family Feud]]'' (1976–1985 and 1994–1995).

==Early life==
Colin Lionel Emm was born in [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]], England, on 20 November 1932<ref name="CNN">{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/03/showbiz/richard-dawson-dies/index.html |publisher=CNN |title=Former 'Family Feud' host Richard Dawson dies |date=3 June 2012 |access-date=3 June 2012}}</ref> to Arthur Emm (born 1897) and Josephine Lucy Emm ({{née}} Lindsay; born 1903).<ref>England and Wales Civil Registration Birth Index, Fourth Quarter, 1932.

In a radio interview with ''Hogan's Heroes'' co-star [[Bob Crane]], Dawson recounted how this experience severely limited his school attendance, stating that he attended school regularly for only two years.<ref>{{cite AV media | title =The Bob Crane Show | publisher =KMPC-Los Angeles| date = 15 September 1972 | first = Richard | last = Dawson | interviewer = [[Bob Crane]] |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToHOM1HC6Os | via= YouTube}}</ref>

At age 14, he ran away from home to join the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|British Merchant Navy]], where he pursued a career in boxing, earning almost $5,000 in shipboard matches.<ref>"Richard Dawson Lost His Own Family Feud with Diana Dors, but His Show Is Hot Comfort," ''People'', 21 November 1977</ref> During 1950 and 1951, he made several passages on the [[RMS Mauretania (1938)|RMS ''Mauretania'']] from Southampton to ports of call, including Nassau, the Bahamas; Havana; and New York.<ref>New York passenger and crew lists for Colin Emm. via Ancestry.com</ref> Following his discharge from the merchant service, he began pursuing a comedy career using the stage name Dickie Dawson; then, he revised his alias to Richard Dawson, the name which he later legally adopted.<ref name="dawson">{{cite web |title=Richard Dawson biography |url= http://www.nndb.com/people/376/000022310 |publisher= NNDB |access-date=24 December 2015}}</ref>

==Career==
===Comedy and variety artist in the UK===
Dawson began his career in England as a stand-up comedian known as Dickie Dawson.<ref name="CNN"/> Possibly his first television appearance occurred on 21 June 1954, when he was 21 and was featured on the ''[[Benny Hill|Benny Hill Showcase]]'', an early [[BBC Television]] program focused on "introducing artists and acts new to television." He also had at least four BBC Radio program appearances during 1954, including two bookings on the ''Midday Music Hall'' on [[BBC Home Service]] and two spots on ''How Do You Do'', a BBC Light Entertainment broadcast billed as "a friendly get-together of Commonwealth artists." In 1958, he appeared alongside his future wife, [[Diana Dors]], on [[BBC TV]]'s ''A to Z: D'', a program featuring entertainers with names beginning with the letter D. In 1959, he made four appearances on BBC TV's ''[[Juke Box Jury]]'', three of them alongside Dors, to whom he was by then married.<ref>BBC Genome Project, catalog of Radio Times listings from 1923 to 2009, found at: https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/</ref>

===Actor and comedian in the US <!-- (''Hogan's Heroes'', ''Laugh-In'', ''Match Game'') -->===
In September 1961, Dawson began hosting a late-night talk show, the [[Mike Stokey]] Show, on Los Angeles channel 13, KCOP.<ref>"Richard Dawson and Family Feud," by Mary Ann Norbom, Signet Books, 1981, pp. 63-65.</ref><ref>Television Academy Foundation: The Interviews, "Talking about Mike Stokey." Found at https://interviews.televisionacademy.com/people/mike-stokey?clip=48328</ref> 
On 8 January 1963, Dawson appeared on ''[[The Jack Benny Program]]'', season 13, episode 15, as an audience member seated next to Jack, barely recognizable in glasses and false moustache.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jack Meets Max Bygraves| date=8 January 1963 | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0613654/ |access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> In the same year Dawson made a guest appearance on ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'' (season 2, episode 27) playing "Racy" Tracy Rattigan,<ref>{{citation |title=Racy Tracy Rattigan |date= 3 April 1963 |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0559796/ |access-date=27 November 2018}}</ref> a lecherous flirt who was the summer replacement host on the Alan Brady Show. He was credited as Dick Dawson.<ref>The Official Dick Van Dyke Show Book, by Vince Waldron, page 334. Applause Theater Books, copyright 1994 and 2001.</ref>

In 1965, Dawson had a small role at the end of the film ''[[King Rat (film)|King Rat]]'', starring [[George Segal]], playing 1st&nbsp;Recon [[paratrooper]] Captain Weaver, sent to liberate allied [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] in a [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] prison. Dawson had by then moved to [[Los Angeles]]. He gained fame in the television show ''Hogan's Heroes'' as Cpl. Peter Newkirk from 1965 to 1971.<ref>{{cite web |title='Family Feud' TV Host Richard Dawson Dies At 79 |url= http://www.krdo.com/news/31148180/detail.html |publisher=[[KRDO-TV]] |access-date= 8 June 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605065318/http://www.krdo.com/news/31148180/detail.html |archive-date=5 June 2012 }}</ref> He had a minor role in [[Universal Pictures|Universal]]'s ''[[Munster, Go Home!]]''. A year later, Dawson released a psychedelic [[Single (music)|45-rpm single]] including the songs "His Children's Parade" and "Apples & Oranges" on Carnation Records. In 1968, Dawson was in the film ''[[The Devil's Brigade (film)|The Devil's Brigade]]'' as Private Hugh McDonald.

Following the cancellation of ''Hogan's Heroes'', Dawson was a regular joke-telling panelist on the short-lived syndicated revival of the game show ''[[Can You Top This?]]'' in 1970 and joined the cast of ''[[Rowan & Martin's Laugh-In]]'' that same year.

After ''Laugh-In'' was cancelled in 1973, game-show pioneer [[Mark Goodson]] signed Dawson to appear as a regular on ''[[Match Game|Match Game '73]]'', alongside [[Brett Somers]], [[Charles Nelson Reilly]], and host [[Gene Rayburn]]. Dawson, who had already served a year as panelist for Goodson's revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]'', proved to be a solid and funny player, and was the frequent choice of contestants to participate in the Head-To-Head Match portion of the "Super-Match" bonus round, in which the contestant and a panelist of the contestant's choice had to match exactly the fill-in-the-blank. During Dawson's time on ''Match Game'', he most often occupied the bottom center seat (he played one week of shows in the top center seat early in the show's run).

===''Family Feud'' host and TV stardom===
[[File:Richard Dawson Family Feud 1976.JPG|thumb|Dawson (left) and contestants on the pilot episode of ''Family Feud'']]

Due to his popularity on ''Match Game'', Dawson expressed to Goodson his desire to host a show of his own. In 1975, during Dawson's tenure as one of ''Match Game''{{'s}} regular panelists, Goodson began development on a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] game show, ''Family Feud''. Dawson's agent practically demanded that Dawson be considered as host, even threatening that he would instruct Dawson not to display his characteristic wit on ''Match Game'' if he were overlooked. Goodson capitulated, and once seeing Dawson's talents as a host, hired Dawson to host ''Feud'', which debuted on 12 July 1976, on ABC's daytime schedule. ''Family Feud'' was a break-out hit, eventually surpassing the ratings of ''Match Game'' in late 1977. In 1978, Dawson left ''Match Game'' due to a combination of the recent introduction of the "Star Wheel", which affected his being selected for the "Head-To-Head Match" portion of the show's "Super Match" bonus round, and of burnout from appearing on both ''Match Game'' and ''Family Feud'' regularly, and he won a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for Best Game Show Host for his work on ''Family Feud''.<ref name="dawson"/> After he left ''Match Game'', his spot on the panel was filled with many other stars, most notably his best friend [[Bob Barker]], who was then the host of ''[[The Price is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price is Right]]''.

One of Dawson's trademarks on ''Family Feud'', kissing the female contestants, earned him the nickname "The Kissing Bandit". Television executives repeatedly tried to get him to stop the kissing.<ref name="NYT"/> After receiving criticism for the practice (which also included a great deal of physical contact such as holding hands and touching), he asked viewers to write in and vote on the matter. The mail response resulted in about 200,000 responses, the wide majority of whom were in favor of the kissing.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Royce |first1=Brenda Scott |title=Hogan's Heroes: The Unofficial Companion |date= 1998 |publisher=Renaissance Books |location=Los Angeles |isbn=978-1-58063-031-3 |page=103 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7SUKAgAAQBAJ&q=kiss%20richard%20dawson&pg=PA103}}</ref> On the 1985 finale, Dawson explained that he kissed contestants for love and luck, something his mother did with Dawson himself as a child.<ref name="CNN"/><ref name="Time">{{cite web |url= http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/03/family-feud-tv-host-richard-dawson-dies-at-79 |title='Family Feud' TV Host Richard Dawson Dies at 79 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=3 June 2012 |access-date=13 January 2016 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120609092332/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/06/03/family-feud-tv-host-richard-dawson-dies-at-79/ |archive-date=9 June 2012 }}</ref>

Dawson was a frequent guest host for ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|Tonight Show]]'' host [[Johnny Carson]], hosting 14 times during 1979<ref>[[List of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson episodes (1979)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}} and 1980.<ref>[[List of The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson episodes (1980)]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=November 2019}} Before  how much longer Carson's tenure would last was known (Carson would host the show until 1992), Dawson was a contender for the role of ''Tonight Show'' host in the event that Carson left the show, a move that he was seriously considering during 1979–80.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.cnn.com/2012/06/03/showbiz/richard-dawson-dies/index.html |title= Former 'Family Feud' host Richard Dawson dies |author = CNN Wire Staff |work=CNN |access-date=15 November 2018}}</ref> Of the few ''Tonight Show'' episodes during Carson's time as host that did not air on the night they were intended, Dawson was a guest host of two. During one, actress [[Della Reese]] suffered a near-fatal [[aneurysm]] mid-interview during taping, and the remainder of the episode was cancelled (Reese later recovered). The other featured an untimely monologue regarding the danger of flying on airplanes; it was replaced with a rerun because it would have aired the same night as the crash of [[American Airlines Flight 191]] in Chicago, which killed all 273 people aboard. (The episode aired several weeks later.)

===Later years===
Dawson parodied his TV persona in 1987's ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' opposite [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], portraying the evil, egotistical game-show host Damon Killian. He received rave reviews for his performance. Film critic Roger Ebert (who gave the film a thumbs down) wrote, "Playing a character who always seems three-quarters drunk, he chain-smokes his way through backstage planning sessions and then pops up in front of the cameras as a cauldron of false jollity. Working the audience, milking the laughs and the tears, he is not really much different [from] most genuine game-show hosts—and that's the film's private joke."<ref>{{cite news |first= Roger |last=Ebert |url= http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19871113/REVIEWS/711130304/1023 |title=''The Running Man'' review |newspaper= [[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=13 November 1987}}</ref>

Dawson hosted an unsold pilot for a revival of the classic game show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'' that was to air on NBC in 1988, but the network declined to pick up the show. In 1990, he auditioned to host the syndicated game show ''[[Trump Card (game show)|Trump Card]]'', but that role went to [[Jimmy Cefalo]].

On 12 September 1994, Dawson returned to the syndicated edition of ''Family Feud'', replacing [[Ray Combs]], who had been fired because the show's ratings were spiraling downward. Dawson finished out what became the final season of the show's official second run (1988–95). Ratings for the show were not in good standing, and ''Family Feud'' was out of production for the next four years. During the revival, he did not kiss the female contestants because of a promise he had made to his young daughter to kiss only her mother. The final episode aired on 26 May 1995, and then Dawson officially retired. In 1999, he was asked by Louie Anderson to make a special appearance on the first episode of that version of ''Family Feud''  to give the new host his blessings, but Dawson turned down the offer and had no further involvement with the show.<ref name="THS">{{cite episode | series = [[E! True Hollywood Story]] | title = Family Feud | date = 28 July 2002 }}</ref>

In 2000, Dawson narrated ''TV's Funniest Game Shows'' on the Fox network.

==Personal life and family==
With his first wife, actress Diana Dors, Dawson had two sons, [[Mark Dawson|Mark]] (born in London, 4 February 1960)<ref>"Diana Dors Has a Son," ''The New York Times'', 5 February 1960, page 23</ref> and Gary (born in Los Angeles, 27 June 1962)<ref>"Diana Dors Has Son," ''The New York Times'', 28 June 1962, page 21.</ref> The marriage ended with a divorce granted in Los Angeles in April 1967,<ref>State of California, ''California Divorce Index, 1966-1984'' page 6068.

He had four grandchildren.<ref>{{cite news |title=Richard Dawson Dies: 'Family Feud' Host Was 79 |url=https://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/06/richard-dawson-dies-family-feud-host-was-79 |newspaper=ABC News |date=3 June 2012 |access-date=13 January 2016}}</ref>

Upon retiring, Dawson remained in Beverly Hills, California, where he had lived since 1964. He met his second wife, Gretchen Johnson (born 22 September 1955), when she was a contestant on ''Family Feud'' in May 1981; they married in 1991. A daughter, Shannon Nicole Dawson, was born in 1990. Dawson announced the birth and showed a picture of his daughter during the inaugural episode of his second stint as host of ''Feud'' in 1994 as he was greeting a contestant who had been a contestant on ''Match Game'' when he was a panelist. The episode was featured on the 25th anniversary of ''Family Feud'' as number two on the [[Game Show Network]]'s top 25 ''Feud'' moments.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIJOsHMcaT4</ref>

During the 1960s and 1970s, Dawson participated in various [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] movements, including the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] and  in a [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign|campaign for George McGovern]] before the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Anderson |first1=Penny P. |title=Richard Dawson getting involved |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yjhgAAAAIBAJ&pg=2535,4970300&hl=en |access-date=20 May 2018 |work=The StarPhoenix |issue=20 July 1973 |location=Saskatoon |via=Google News}}</ref>

Dawson used to smoke almost four packs of cigarettes per day, and he was seen smoking on some episodes of ''Match Game'', ''Family Feud'', and ''Hogan's Heroes''. His daughter Shannon convinced him to stop smoking by 1994, when he was 61.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}
