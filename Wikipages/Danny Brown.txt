== Early life ==
Sewell was born in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] on March 16, 1981. At the time, his mother was 18 and his father was 16.<ref name="complex1">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Danny Brown - Growing Up In Detroit|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#2|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=January 18, 2012|access-date=January 18, 2012|archive-date=January 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120223636/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#2|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="complex2">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Danny Brown - Growing Up Part-Filipino|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#3|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=January 18, 2012|access-date=January 18, 2012|archive-date=January 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120223636/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#3|url-status=live}}</ref> His father is half Filipino. Brown's talent for rhyming came at a very young age, as his mother would read [[Dr. Seuss books]] to him as a child; when he began to speak, he would talk in rhyme. His father was a house DJ who exposed Brown to all the music he would spin, as well as music from the likes of [[Roy Ayers]], [[LL Cool J]], [[Esham]], and [[A Tribe Called Quest]].<ref name="alterego">{{cite web|title=Danny Brown|url=http://www.alteregomgt.com/bookings/danny-brown|publisher=AlterEgoManagement|date=December 3, 2008|access-date=February 24, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202112909/http://www.alteregomgt.com/bookings/danny-brown|archive-date=February 2, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> For as long as he could remember, Brown had always wanted to be a rapper: "In kindergarten I'd say I wanted to be a rapper and people'd just laugh at me. 'That's a pretty funny job,' they'd say."<ref name="metrotimes">{{cite web|author=Doug Coombe|title=Hotshot emcee Danny Brown finds inspiration and repose|url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/culture/story.asp?id=13501|publisher=[[Metro Times]]|date=December 3, 2008|access-date=February 24, 2012|archive-date=September 17, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AkidO7pm?url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/culture/story.asp?id=13501|url-status=live}}</ref>

His young parents did their best to shelter him from the Detroit [[street crime]] and gang life: "My parents ain't really want me out the house. They did as much as they possibly could to keep me in the house with whatever the newest video game was. But you know you can only keep a kid in for so long. Plus that had me sheltered, so once I did get away I used to disappear for like four days."<ref name="complex1"/> His two grandmothers helped provide for his family. His maternal grandmother worked for Chrysler, and she bought four to five houses: "To this day we still got those houses. She owns three houses in a row on that block. She raised her three children and a host of others in the middle house; the one to the left she paid cash for in the '90s from her long time neighbor; and the one on the right was her parents' home that she inherited when they died." She also owned two other homes on the east side of Detroit, one in which Brown was raised. The fifth house, also located on the east side, was occupied by his aunt and her family: "I used to get beat up all the time. I had nobody over there and I'm the oldest with two brothers and a younger sister. And I'm kind of not really gangster like that," Brown said in a 2012 interview.<ref name="complex1"/> Originally from the [[Dexter-Linwood, Detroit|Dexter-Linwood]] way of Detroit, Brown later moved to [[Hamtramck]]. He heavily associates with Detroit in his music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/+wiki|title=Danny Brown's Biography — Free listening, videos, concerts, stats and photos at Last.fm|website=www.last.fm|access-date=December 21, 2011|archive-date=November 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111109010249/http://www.last.fm/music/Danny+Brown/+wiki|url-status=live}}</ref>

At age 18, Brown became a drug dealer: "Once I got above a certain age, all that parent shit stopped. My mom and my pops split up. Once my pops left, I was the man of the house. I always told myself I was going to be a rapper my whole life. I was selling drugs since that's what all my friends were doing. And it was kind of like something to rap about maybe."<ref name="complex3">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Danny Brown - Taking Rap Seriously|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#7|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=January 18, 2012|access-date=January 18, 2012|archive-date=January 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120223636/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#7|url-status=live}}</ref> Although his intentions were to stop once he got in trouble with the law, Brown was already too accustomed to the lifestyle: "I always told myself once I got my first [legal] case I was gonna stop. Then I got my first case, but I didn't stop. I got distribution and manufacturing and possession with intent to distribute. I was 19."<ref name="complex3"/> His run-ins with the law didn't stop there: "I caught my second case loitering with some [[Cannabis (drug)|weed]], but it violated my probation but I ran and I didn't go to court. I just ran for like at least five years. But once I got caught I had to do eight months. When I violated my probation, I got my second case and I was scared. I had warrants so I couldn't really slang like that cause I didn't wanna go to jail. I was broke in the hood. I had nothing else, so I just started going back to studying music and trying to become a rapper."<ref name="complex3"/> After he did his time, Brown began to take his passion seriously and turn it into a career: "I got out of jail in '07. I took it serious from that time but it took a lot of shit to happen in my life to get me confident to know I could do it. I had more confidence when I got out of jail because the day when I got out of jail I started selling weed. I ain't had no money after the first two months, like, 'I was way better off in jail.' By then I was already making my New York trips and going to recording studios so I was already serious when I got locked up. When I got out it was like, 'It's now or never.'"<ref name="complex3"/>

Brown began his career in a [[rap group|hip hop group]] called Rese'vor Dogs, alongside fellow Detroit-based rappers Chips and Dopehead. In 2003, the trio independently released an album titled ''Runispokets-N-Dumpemindariva'' under Ren-A-Sance Entertainment and F.B.C. Records. In the summer of 2003, the group received mild [[Rotation (music)|rotation]] on Detroit radio stations with their [[lead single]], "Yes".<ref name="metrotimes"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://theloopdetroit.com/2008/04/the-all-inclusive-danny-brown-appreciation-post/|title=The All-Inclusive Danny Brown Appreciation Post|author=Kelly Frazier|date=April 14, 2008|access-date=January 4, 2012|publisher=The Loop Detroit|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170912192718/http://theloopdetroit.com/2008/04/the-all-inclusive-danny-brown-appreciation-post/|archive-date=September 12, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> After growing up on hip hop and tuning his rhyming skills in the city, Brown landed the attention of [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] A&R Travis Cummings, who flew Brown out to [[New York City]], where he began recording in other artists' studios. After a lack of success with Roc-A-Fella, Brown returned to Detroit and eventually linked up with Detroit-based producer [[Nick Speed]].<ref name="alterego"/><ref name="metrotimes"/>

== Career ==

=== 2010: ''The Hybrid'' ===
{{Main|The Hybrid (album)}}
In 2010, Brown befriended fellow American rapper [[Tony Yayo]] of [[G-Unit]], and together they recorded their collaborative effort, ''Hawaiian Snow'' (2010). The G-Unit association led many to wonder if Brown would eventually sign with [[50 Cent]]'s [[G-Unit Records]]. But Brown, who favors [[Slim-fit pants|fitted jeans]] and a vintage rock-inspired wardrobe, didn't fit with G-Unit's [[Reputation|image]]: "It was a real thing. 50 was with it; he just didn't sign me because of my jeans. He liked the music, but he didn't like the way I looked," Brown told [[MTV]]. "I understand where they were coming from with that, but you gotta understand where I'm coming from too: I'm from Detroit."<ref name="MTV">{{cite web|author=Rob Markman|title=Danny Brown Admits Drug Habit, Failed G-Unit Deal|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669170/danny-brown-xxx-mixtape.jhtml|publisher=MTV|date=August 16, 2011|access-date=February 24, 2012|archive-date=January 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131131708/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1669170/danny-brown-xxx-mixtape.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref>

After recording and releasing four volumes of his ''Detroit State of Mind'' [[mixtape]] series and other free self-released mixtapes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kevinnottingham.com/2010/10/02/danny-brown-discography/|title=Danny Brown: Discography|author=Kevin Nottingham|date=October 2, 2011|access-date=January 16, 2012|publisher=www.kevinnottingham.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120116114018/http://kevinnottingham.com/2010/10/02/danny-brown-discography/|archive-date=January 16, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Brown released his first solo studio album, ''[[The Hybrid (Danny Brown album)|The Hybrid]]'' (2010), on [[Washington, DC]]-based [[indie record label]] Rappers I Know. It was this album where Brown began to use his trademark high-pitched voice: "The first song that I ever rapped [with the high-pitched voice] was 'The Hybrid,' that's why we called it 'The Hybrid.' I think that was [when I found my voice]. That was the statement that I can rap and I can do every style of rap."<ref name="complex4">{{cite web|author=Insanu Ahmed|title=Who Is Danny Brown - Working On The Hybrid & Finding His (High-Pitched) Voice|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#11|publisher=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|date=January 18, 2012|access-date=January 18, 2012|archive-date=January 20, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120223636/http://www.complex.com/music/2012/01/who-is-danny-brown#11|url-status=live}}</ref> The album came to fruition after he had written the aforementioned song: "''The Hybrid'' started out because I started working with Hex Murder. Hex was managing me at the time and I had started recording in [[Black Milk]]'s studio. We were working on a project and I had come up with the song 'The Hybrid,' so that gave me my whole intent on what I wanted to do with my next project. I started writing a new album and that's the album that I wrote. Then I hooked up with my homie Magnetic and he would just look out for me and gave me free studio time—so I would go record from 3 in the morning til 6 in the morning, because we were using the free time when nobody was there. Then I hooked up with Frank from Rappers I Know. I liked what he was doing with his blog. He looked out for me and helped me out a lot and then we put it out and the rest is history."<ref name="complex4"/>

Signing to Fool's Gold Records proved to be Brown's biggest commercial and critical move. The label would go on to release his second studio album, ''[[XXX (Danny Brown album)|XXX]],'' as a free download. It received numerous critical accolades, including being named the best hip hop album of the year by ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/articles/spins-40-best-rap-albums-2011?page=0%2C7|title=SPIN's 40 Best Rap Albums of 2011|date=December 8, 2011|access-date=December 28, 2011|publisher=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|archive-date=September 17, 2012|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6AkilSyVe?url=http://www.spin.com/articles/spins-40-best-rap-albums-2011?page=0,7|url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]]'' gave his album an 8.2 out of 10, saying, "If ''XXX'' was nothing but debauchery and desperation, it would quickly devolve into an endless slog.
