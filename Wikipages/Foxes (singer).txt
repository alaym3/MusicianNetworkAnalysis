==Early life and education==
Allen was born in [[Southampton]], [[Hampshire]], and grew up in the city's [[Swaythling]] and [[St Denys]] areas. She attended St Denys Primary School, [[Cantell School]], and [[Eastleigh College]].<ref name=SDE/> She started writing music when she was 14 years old and reached the final of a local talent competition in 2009.<ref name=SDE/> At 18 years old, she considered training as a beauty therapist, but her sister persuaded her to move to [[London]] to pursue her singing ambitions.<ref name=DR>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/celebrity-interviews/singer-foxes-missed-chance-stardom-3464836|title=Singer Foxes almost missed chance at stardom for a life with nail varnish and make-up|author=John Dingwall|date=27 April 2014|work=dailyrecord|access-date=7 April 2015}}</ref> She attended [[the Institute of Contemporary Music Performance]] but dropped out, preferring to write and perform music than study it.<ref name=ES/><ref name=lifeandtimes/>

==Career==
===2011–2014: ''Warrior'' and ''Glorious''===
Allen devised a stage name to differentiate herself from British pop singer [[Lily Allen]]. She considered the alias Foxes after a suggestion from a friend, the first song she had written being titled "Like Foxes Do"; her mother then told her that she had a dream the previous night "about these foxes running up our street and they were howling and making these beautiful noises", which she said reminded her of her daughter's music. Allen chose Foxes based on this connection.<ref name=independent/> She began performing [[Gig (music)|gigs]] as Foxes in London in 2011.<ref name=SDE>{{cite web|last=Churchward|first=Sally|title=Former Southampton pupil is taking the states by storm|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/news/10675892.City_singer_Foxes_is_top_of_the_US_charts/|work=[[Southern Daily Echo]]|access-date=27 January 2014}}</ref>
