== History ==

=== Early years ===
In the early 1980s, lead vocalist [[Wong Ka Kui]] and drummer [[Yip Sai Wing]] started out as young musicians who were both interested in [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[progressive rock]].<ref name="Big5beyond">Big5.china.com.cn. "[http://big5.china.com.cn/gate/big5/tongcheng.china.com.cn/ticket/star-1040.html Big5.china.com.cn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327153303/http://big5.china.com.cn/gate/big5/tongcheng.china.com.cn/ticket/star-1040.html |date=27 March 2012 }}." ''Beyond.'' Retrieved on 27 December 2010. {{in lang|zh}}</ref> In 1983, they decided to join a music contest for "Guitar magazine" and they decided to form a band with lead guitarist William Tang (鄧煒謙) and bassist Lee Wing Chiu (李榮潮). Tang wished the band's name to convey a feeling of surpassing or going beyond themselves, so the name "Beyond" was chosen.<ref name="hkh1" /><ref name="Big5beyond" /> However, the band name was not definite at the time.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> The band's musical style was still [[Experimental music|experimental]]. Wong Ka Kui and [[Tai Chi (band)|Tai Chi]] lead guitarist Joey Tang formed a temporary band called NASA band that did [[art rock]] style of music with [[Hong Kong English pop|English pop]].<ref name="Big5beyond" />

In 1984, Wong's younger brother [[Wong Ka Keung]] joined the band as bassist.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> At the time, the band consisted of Wong Ka Kui, Yip Sai Wing, Wong Ka Keung and new lead guitarist Chan Sze On (陳時安).<ref name="Big5beyond" /> Chan soon had to leave for a foreign country, leaving the band without lead guitarist. In 1985 [[Paul Wong (musician)|Paul Wong]] joined the band to replace him.<ref name="Big5beyond" />

In the early years, time was difficult for the band. They had to do everything themselves, including organising its finance, selling tickets, performing and buying their own equipment. The band's first self-financed concert took place in 1985 at [[Caritas Hong Kong|Caritas Centre]] in Hong Kong. The show was unsuccessful, but caught the attention of their first manager.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Chow|first=Vivienne|date=2018-06-24|title=Beyond: 25 years after the death of Hong Kong rock giants' frontman|url=https://www.scmp.com/culture/music/article/2151986/story-beyond-25-years-hong-kongs-biggest-rock-band-lost-its-frontman|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-05|website=[[South China Morning Post]]|language=en}}</ref> He would help them raise [[HK$]]16,000, but the band was soon left with only HK$1000.<ref name="Big5beyond" />

In 1986, the band rented a studio to record the album ''Goodbye My Dreams'' (再見理想).<ref name="Big5beyond" /> Lau Chi Yuen (劉志遠) then joined Beyond as lead guitarist and keyboardist. At the time Small island, [[Tat Ming Pair]] and Beyond made a recording together. Small island was scheduled to go to a July 1986 Pan-Asian Music Festival in [[Taipei]], and Beyond was added to the schedule.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> Beyond was well liked and they joined another festival that same year.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> They would then sign with Kinn's Music record company.<ref name="Big5beyond" />

=== Commercial success ===
In 1987, Beyond produced the second album. The album ''Arabian Dancing Girls'' (阿拉伯跳舞女郎) was one of the band's first commercial hits.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> They soon were in a new music underground trend along with a few number of bands, such as [[Tai Chi (Band)|Tai Chi]], Cocos and Raidas.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> Lau Chi Yuen left the band in 1988, leaving the band with four members only.<ref name="Big5beyond" />

In 1989, Beyond became the first Hong Kong band to perform in [[Beijing]] at the [[Capital Indoor Stadium]]. Since Beyond's songs were in [[Cantonese]] (instead of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]), the performance was not well received by the audience.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> Before the stadium was filled, half the people had already left.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> However, they still considered the concert a success.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> After a couple of flops, Beyond started to gain popularity following the release of the hit song "Great Land" (大地).<ref name="Big5beyond" /> They would soon win their first musical awards, the [[1988 Jade Solid Gold Best Ten Music Awards Presentation]] and [[1989 RTHK Top 10 Gold Songs Awards]].

In 1990, they released one of their signature songs, "Glorious Years" (光輝歲月). The song was about racism and the struggle of [[Nelson Mandela]] in [[South Africa]].<ref name="Big5beyond" /><ref>Arts.cultural-china.com. "[http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/97A3179A9206.html Arts.cultural-china.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006175013/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/97A3179A9206.html |date=6 October 2011 }}." ''Arts.'' Retrieved on 22 December 2010.</ref> The song was a huge hit, and had a fresh sound that stood out from the sea of love songs that dominated the Cantopop scene in Hong Kong. The song was from the band's album ''Party of Fate'' (命運派對), which sold extremely well, achieving [[Music recording sales certification|triple platinum]].<ref name="Big5beyond" /> According to a later interview with Wong Ka-Keung, Mandela was "deeply moved" when he heard about the song during his final days in hospital.<ref name="5Things" />

In 1991, Beyond released another critically acclaimed song "Amani" from the album ''Hesitation'' (猶豫). The song was written during Beyond's trip to [[Tanzania]].<ref name="greenpeace">http://www.greenpeace.org. "[http://www.greenpeace.org/china/zh/about/staff/yongrong www.greenpeace.org]." ''雍容 政府與公共事務主任.'' Retrieved on 27 December 2010.</ref> As suggested by the title, which means "peace" in [[Swahili language|Swahili]], the song is about the plight of war-ravaged [[Africa]] and the yearning for world peace. Part of the song's lyrics were written in Swahili. The song is still often used by Hong Kong's human rights bands to spread the message of peace.<ref name="greenpeace" />

In the same year, Beyond made their first appearance on Japan's [[NHK]] station. They immediately signed with record company Amuse.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> Beyond started to become a more international band, and began to focus more time in Japan and Taiwan.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> The album ''[[Continue the Revolution]]'' (繼續革命) achieved commercial and critical success. In May 1993, Beyond released the album ''[[Rock and Roll (Beyond album)|Rock and Roll]]'' (樂與怒) which included the song "[[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]" (海闊天空).<ref name="Big5beyond" /> That song would become Wong Ka Kui's last song with the band.<ref name="Big5beyond" />

=== Death of Wong Ka Kui ===

Beyond arrived in Japan in January 1993 to record new material and engage in media appearances. On 24 June 1993, the band appeared at a Tokyo [[Fuji Television]] game show ''Ucchan-nanchan no Yarunara Yaraneba'' {{Nihongo|2=ウッチャンナンチャンのやるならやらねば!}}.<ref>{{Cite news|last=McClure|first=Steve|date=1993-07-10|title=Hong Kong Rocker Dies After TV Mishap|page=32|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CxAEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34|access-date=2021-06-05|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> The stage platform was 2.7 to 3m high.<ref name="arts" /><ref name="Bag">Bagua.ifensi.com.

The death occurred at the prime of the band's career, with the tremendous success of the song "[[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]" released around the time.<ref name="Big5beyond" /> His funeral procession caused traffic in various major streets in Hong Kong to come to a standstill, and many top Hong Kong Cantopop singers of the time attended and paid tribute at the funeral.  Criticisms followed that the Japanese were having too many late night shows of this type, and the TV station crews were overworked.<ref name="Bag" />

=== Post Ka Kui era ===
There was debate as to whether the remaining three members should continue to record and perform as Beyond. Eventually, they reappeared on 30 November 1993 in Hong Kong at the Composer's Tribute Night concert.<ref name="beyondhistory">Beyondmusic.net. "[http://www.beyondmusic.net/history.html Beyondmusic.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132052/http://www.beyondmusic.net/history.html |date=21 July 2011 }}." ''Beyond.''

Beyond's first album in the post Ka Kui era was ''2nd Floor Back Suite'' (二樓後座).<ref name="Big5beyond" /> In 1997 the album ''Please Let Go of Your Hands'' also made a reference to Hong Kong's cultural changes after the [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|handover of Hong Kong to China]].<ref name="Big5beyond" /><ref>Music.douban.com. "[http://music.douban.com/review/1338894/ Music.douban.com]." ''album review.'' Retrieved on 27 December 2010.</ref>

In November 1999, the three remaining Beyond members announced that they would pursue their own solo career after a world tour.<ref name="hkh1" /> In 2003 for the band's 20th anniversary, they came out to embark on a world tour.  The tour included stops in [[Toronto]] [[Canada]], and various cities in mainland China.

In 2005, they played their last tour (The Story Live 2005) under the name Beyond and announced their disbandment at their last stop in Singapore.<ref name="Big5beyond" />

For the first time in three years, the three remaining members of Beyond reunited to play "[[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]" for the Wong Ka Kui Memorial Concert. The concert was organised by Wong Ka Keung as a birthday tribute to his brother 15 years after his death which featured covers of Ka Kui's songs by bands and artists such as Kolor, [[Tai Chi (band)|Tai Chi]], [[Soler (band)|Soler]] and [[at17]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.yesasia.com/global/wong-kar-kui-memorial-concert-karaoke-2dvd/1011813741-0-0-0-en/info.html|title=YESASIA: Wong Kar Kui Memorial Concert Karaoke (2DVD) DVD - Beyond, Wong Ka Kui, Go East (HK) - Cantonese Concerts & Music Videos - Free Shipping|website=www.yesasia.com|access-date=2019-06-12}}</ref>

In 2009, Wong Ka Keung and Paul Wong held a series of concerts called "This is Rock & Roll" between 24 July and the 26th in Hong Kong.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kix-files.com/2009/07/beyond-this-is-rocknroll-rmc/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213856/http://kix-files.com/2009/07/beyond-this-is-rocknroll-rmc/ |archive-date=4 October 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref>

== Legacy ==
The song "[[Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies]]" has been used in many charity events. For example, the song's lyrics was modified and used for the massive [[Artistes 512 Fund Raising Campaign]] after the [[2008 Sichuan earthquake]].<ref>Sina.com.

The original lyrics of the song "Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies" epitomizes the untamed pursuit of ideals and freedom despite obstacles. The song is widely sung by the protesters in the [[2014 Hong Kong protests]], which aim to fight for the implementation of universal suffrage in accordance with the [[Hong Kong Basic Law]] and [[Sino-British Joint Declaration]].

The song "Glorious Years" ({{lang|zh-hk|光輝歲月}}) is also used as the theme song for Hong Kong's political activities. For example, the song was used for Hong Kong's [[2010 Hong Kong by-election|Five Constituencies Referendum]] where the [[Pro-democracy camp in Hong Kong|pan-democrats]] tried to push for a by-election.<ref name="HKdaily1">[http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=83721# "晚會繼續高呼「起義」"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721085352/http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/news.php?id=83721 |date=21 July 2011 }}, Hkdailynews.com.
