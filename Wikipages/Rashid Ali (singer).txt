'''Rashid Ali''' is a singer, guitarist, musician and composer, who first became known for the hit song Kabhi Kabhi Aditi from [[Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na]].

==Personal life==
Born in [[Hyderabad, India]] and brought up in London, his father is a retired businessman and mother is a [[ghazal]] singer who trained with [[Ustad Ghulam Mustafa Khan]]. Rashid's sensibility towards music has been multi-ethnic and diverse, and although he had basic training on the rhythm guitar for one year, he taught himself all aspects of playing the lead guitar and improvisation by listening to all genres of music, in particular Jazz fusion, Spanish and Latin music. He never had any vocal lessons either and has a natural ability to sing.

==Professional life==
Rashid was spotted at a concert in London by [[A R Rahman]]. He was then invited by [[A R Rahman]] to be a part of Unity of Light Concert where he performed a jazz centric fusion of 'Ooh La La La'<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rahmaniac.wordpress.com/2008/05/25/rashid-ali-new-gem-of-a-r-rahman |title=Rashid Ali ~ The New gem of A R Rahman " A R Rahman Exclusive Blog ~ Rahmaniac |publisher=Rahmaniac.wordpress.com |date=25 May 2008 |accessdate=6 December 2011}}</ref> and has been a regular feature of [[A R Rahman]] shows since then. He started doing vocals for [[A R Rahman]] for the first time in [[Parthale Paravasam]] in 2002. He has sung two songs in [[Jaane Tu Ya Jaane Na]] which became chartbusters and earned him nominations for best playback male singer for Filmfare,Stardust, Star Screen Awards and Radio Mirchi Awards 2008/2009. His recent hits are "Call Me Dil" and "Cry Cry" from ''[[Jhootha Hi Sahi]]''. He is also a guitarist by profession and is usually associated with Rahman in his film songs including playing guitar and singing Kabhi Kabhi Aditi ( also creating that special guitar line which was placed at the intro of the song), Ishq Ada Hai and most recently the steel string rhythm guitar on [[Call Me Dil]] song from Jhootha Hi Sahi.

Rashid has finished working on his own debut album titled 'Call Me Rashid' which will introduce some original music. The album has been produced by [[A R Rahman]] under his own label KM Music. The music has been composed and arranged by Rashid Ali. [[Bollywood]] actress [[Tabu (actress)|Tabu]] is making her debut in a music video through this album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiaglitz.com/channels/hindi/article/54235.html|title=ARR – Rashid Ali – Tabu-New Music Video Album?}}</ref> The first taster preview of the album with a duet with Rashid and a singer from Dhaka Bangladesh, Faria Chaudhary, was posted on A R Rahman's Facebook page on 22 December 2010. The clip was from an adapted Hindi version of the song Ayriliq meaning Separation, a traditional folk song from Azerbaijan.

Rashid's Album titled "Call Me Rashid" has been launched by Artist Aloud (Headed by Hungama Digital Media Ltd) on 28 November 2011. Samples of the song have also been posted on the main website [http://kmmusiq.com/call_me_rashid.html KM Musiq] as well as on www.artistaloud.com.

On 1 November 2012, he performed with A R Rahman in Bhopal, India in celebration of the foundation of Madhya Pradesh. In 2013, Rashid has decided to position himself in Mumbai a lot more and shortly after arriving in India recorded a romantic number for another film soundtrack composed by A R Rahman entitled, "Raanjhanaa". The song is his first duet with [[Neeti Mohan]] entitled, "Nazar Laaye" and the film was released on 21 June 2013.

In response to people loving the song, "Nazar Laaye" which featured the voices of Rashid Ali and Neeti Mohan, Rashid got to work to write a special single featuring Neeti Mohan called "Tu Hai (Autumn Love)" on which he played all the instruments and produced it. This was released in December 2013 and is available as a Free Download exclusively from Rashid's website, www.rashidali.com.
