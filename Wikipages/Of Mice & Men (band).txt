'''Of Mice & Men''' (often abbreviated '''OM&M''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Costa Mesa, California]], in 2009. The band's line-up currently consists of drummer Valentino Arteaga, guitarists Phil Manansala and  Alan Ashby, and bassist and lead vocalist [[Aaron Pauley]]. The group was founded by former lead vocalist [[Austin Carlile]] and former bassist Jaxin Hall in mid-2009 after Carlile's departure from [[Attack Attack! (American band)|Attack Attack!]]. Carlile departed from the band in December 2016 citing that a long-term health condition prompted his exit. After Carlile's departure, the band continued to pursue creating music with Pauley as the band's bassist and lead vocalist.

Since 2009, the band has released six studio albums: ''[[Of Mice & Men (album)|Of Mice & Men]]'' (2010), ''[[The Flood (Of Mice & Men album)|The Flood]]'' (2011), ''[[Restoring Force (album)|Restoring Force]]'' (2014), ''[[Cold World (Of Mice & Men album)|Cold World]]'' (2016), ''[[Defy (album)|Defy]]'' (2018), and ''[[Earthandsky]]'' (2019). Of Mice & Men's earlier music has been described as [[metalcore]] and [[post-hardcore]]. Their later material, however, has been considered to be more melodic and shifted over to genres such as [[nu metal]], [[alternative metal]], and [[hard rock]], while retaining their original sound.

The band has played international music festivals including the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] in 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014 and [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Music Festival]] in 2013 and 2015.

===Departure of Carlile and Hall (2010–2011)===
[[Jerry Roush]], who was formerly a part of [[Sky Eats Airplane]], soon became a permanent addition to Of Mice & Men. Originally, Roush was a substitute for Austin Carlile on the Emptiness Tour in 2010 which featured the band along with [[Alesana]], [[A Skylit Drive]], [[the Word Alive]], and [[We Came as Romans]].<ref>[http://mindequalsblown.net/2010/02/update-jerry-roush-filling-in-for-austin-carlile-of-mice-and-men/ Jerry Roush filling in for Austin Carlile Of Mice and Men] Mind Equals Blown</ref> Carlile required a heart surgery performed in the near future and was forced to not tour by his doctor. At the same time, Carlile fell into a conflict with the other members. Through much deliberation, the band and Carlile decided to part ways.<ref>Karan, Tim (April 4, 2010).

The band's style employs a contrast between harsh vocals and standard singing. Currently, frontman/bassist Aaron Pauley performs both techniques.

Of Mice & Men's influences include bands such as [[Alice in Chains]], [[Deftones]], [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]], [[Korn]], [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Linkin Park]], [[Papa Roach]], [[P.O.D.]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], [[Staind]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]].<ref>[http://www.mtv.com/artists/of-mice-men/related-artists/?filter=influencedBy Artist Influences For Of Mice & Men] ''[[MTV]]''</ref><ref>[http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/of-mice-mens-austin-carlile-calls-pantera-my-dads-music-says-linkin-park-was-his-band/ OF MICE & MEN's AUSTIN CARLILE Calls PANTERA 'My Dad's Music', Says LINKIN PARK Was His Band] ''[[Blabbermouth]]''</ref>

==Band name==
When asked about the band's name origin, former vocalist Austin Carlile responded with:
{{cquote|"The book ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' says 'the well laid plans of mice and men often falter.' You make plans, and they get screwed up. [Jaxin Hall] and I both had plans for life, and they both got screwed up, so now we're making the most of what we can."}}

Former bassist Jaxin Hall also commented, stating:
{{cquote|"The main theme of [''Of Mice and Men''] is the [[American Dream]] [...] and being self sufficient [...] As a band, I was thinking about that when Austin and I were thinking about forming this band that we wanted this to be our American Dream, especially considering that I'm not from America [...] So this was to be our self sufficient thing that we could live off and make our own and achieve this dream. [...] So I looked at things that happened with [past relationships] and that everyone had the best intentions with things, and that they didn't quite work out the way we wanted it to."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=szVZBBeocqE|title=Of Mice & Men Q&A|date=August 12, 2009|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=December 27, 2009}}</ref>}}
