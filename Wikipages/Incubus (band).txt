'''Incubus''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Calabasas, California]]. The band was formed in 1991 by vocalist [[Brandon Boyd]], lead guitarist [[Mike Einziger]], and drummer [[José Pasillas]] while enrolled in [[Calabasas High School]] and later expanded to include bassist [[Alex Katunich|Alex "Dirk Lance" Katunich]], and [[Gavin Koppell|Gavin "DJ Lyfe" Koppell]]; both of whom were eventually replaced by bassist [[Ben Kenney]] and [[Chris Kilmore|DJ Kilmore]], respectively.

Incubus has attained commercial success, reaching [[multi-platinum]] sales, as well as releasing several successful [[singles (music)|singles]]. After their first two albums, ''[[Fungus Amongus]]'' (1995) and ''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'' (1997), the band earned mainstream recognition with the release of their 1999 album ''[[Make Yourself]]'' which spawned several hits, including the band's highest charting song "[[Drive (Incubus song)|Drive]]." Success continued with the albums ''[[Morning View]]'' (2001) and ''[[A Crow Left of the Murder...]]'' (2004). Their sixth studio album, ''[[Light Grenades]]'', debuted at No.&nbsp;1 in 2006 and was followed by Incubus's first greatest hits album ''[[Monuments and Melodies]]'' in June 2009 and the band's 2011 album, ''[[If Not Now, When? (album)|If Not Now, When?]]''. Incubus also released an EP, ''[[Trust Fall (Side A)]]'', in early 2015, and two years later, the band released their eighth studio album, titled ''[[8 (Incubus album)|8]]'', on April 21, 2017. A second EP, ''Trust Fall (Side B)'', was released on April 17, 2020.<ref name=":1"/> Worldwide, Incubus has sold over 19 million albums.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

==History==
===Formation, ''Fungus Amongus'' and ''Enjoy Incubus'' (1991–1996)===
Incubus was formed in 1991 by vocalist [[Brandon Boyd]], guitarist [[Mike Einziger]], bassist [[Alex Katunich]] and drummer [[José Pasillas]], while the members were in high school. They existed as a band for some time before they gave themselves a name, having only chosen the band's name "Incubus" when required to supply a band name for an upcoming show.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02yCFBfNRtI |title=Incubus YouTube Channel |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=December 4, 2012}}</ref> The band's early shows were frequently at nightclubs on [[Los Angeles]]'s [[Sunset Strip]], including such well-known venues as the [[Whisky a Go Go]], [[Roxy Theatre (West Hollywood)|the Roxy]] and the Troubadour. Early on the members of Incubus bonded over Phish and Primus and used their grassroots approach as a model for their career.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jambands.com/Features/content_2004_08_29.03.phtml|title=Jambands.com &#124; Features &#124; COVENTRY CoverageWhat Is The Theme of this Everlasting Spoof?

Incubus produced many of their early recordings with Jim Wirt and Chillum Records in the Santa Monica studio 4th Street Recording, only able to work on their music during hours in which they were not in school. In 1995, Incubus added [[Gavin Koppell]] (known by his stage name DJ Lyfe) to the band and recorded their first two-song EP, ''[[Let Me Tell Ya 'Bout Root Beer]]''. This was followed by the debut album ''[[Fungus Amongus]]'', also recorded with Wirt and released on Incubus's own label ''Stopuglynailfungus Music''. In the following year, Incubus signed a seven-record deal with [[Sony Music|Sony]]'s [[Immortal Records]], later to become [[Epic Records]].<ref name="latimes2003">{{cite web|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2003/apr/11/business/fi-incubus11|title=Sony and Incubus Reach New Agreement|first=Jeff|last=Leeds|date=April 11, 2003|website=Articles.latimes.com|access-date=December 22, 2016|via=LA Times}}</ref> The group was spotted by Epic/Immortal A&R Paul Pontius, who was also responsible for signing [[Korn]] to the label.<ref>[http://www.universalmusic.com/paul-pontius-promoted-to-executive-vice-president-ar-island-records/] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref> The 1997 six-track EP ''[[Enjoy Incubus]]'' was the band's first major-label release and was created so the band could present a recording while touring with Korn in Europe.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url= https://www.allmusic.com/artist/incubus-mn0000772745/biography |first= Steve |last= Huey |title= Incubus – Artist Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date= January 19, 2013}}</ref>

===''S.C.I.E.N.C.E.'' (1997–1998)===
''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'', Incubus's second studio album, was released on September 9, 1997. After their album release, they started opening for bands such as [[Korn]] and [[311 (band)|311]].<ref name="allmusic"/> This album marked a stylistic departure from the band's early material, featuring heavy guitar riffs, slap bass and turntables to create their most nu metal album.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/riot-fest-incubus-nu-metal-make-yourself-morning-view-boyd/Content?oid=57831546|title=Incubus hated nu-metal before hating nu-metal was cool|first=Leor|last=Galil|newspaper=[[Chicago Reader]]|access-date=October 6, 2020}}</ref> In February 1998, Incubus dismissed Koppell.

The band enjoyed Kilmore's style and attitude towards life and asked him to join the band. Incubus participated in the [[Ozzfest]] and [[Family Values Tour|Family Values]] [[Heavy metal music|metal]] festivals and toured with [[System of a Down]] and [[Ultraspank]] during the fall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1430284/19980824/incubus.jhtml|title=System of a Down, Incubus, Ultraspank Graduate from Ozzfest to a Tour of Their Own|date=August 24, 1998|publisher=MTV News|access-date=May 28, 2009}}</ref> Chris Kilmore, also known as DJ Kilmore, replaced DJ Lyfe.<ref name="allmusic"/>

===''Make Yourself'' (1999–2000)===
After constant touring throughout 1998, and after selling over 100,000 copies of ''[[S.C.I.E.N.C.E.]]'' without the support of radio or television exposure, Incubus took a break for two years and then released their critically acclaimed third album ''[[Make Yourself]]''.

After just two weeks in the studio with producer Jim Wirt, the band was unhappy with the recordings and opted to continue recording without a producer. After another 3 weeks of recording, [[R.E.M.]]/[[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] producer [[Scott Litt]] took an interest in their songs and started taking part in the recording sessions, mainly focusing on songs like "[[Drive (Incubus song)|Drive]]" and "[[Stellar (song)|Stellar]]". According to the band, Litt's involvement in the record came mostly during the mixing process.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

''Make Yourself'' was released on October 26, 1999. The album marked the beginning of a more commercially acceptable [[pop rock]] and [[alternative rock]] sound for the band,<ref name="ind"/> although several songs from the album still included elements of [[nu metal|nu/alternative metal]], such as downtuned riffs and layers of electronics.<ref name="MYallmusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/make-yourself-mw0000542004 |title=''Make Yourself'' – Incubus |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=October 1, 2015 |last=Huey |first=Steve}}</ref> Right after their album's release, the band went on tour with [[Primus (band)|Primus]] and [[Buckethead]], a tour which lasted for the remainder of the year. The first song that kicked off the album, "Privilege", was featured on ''MTV Sports: Pure Ride'' for the [[PlayStation]]. The band also released the single, "[[Pardon Me]]", but it was initially not well received by radio stations. Brandon and Mike decided to perform a live acoustic version of the song at the few radio stations who were showing interest, and this in turn spread the word of the song. Many radio stations began to play the acoustic version, including the influential Los Angeles radio giant [[KROQ-FM]].
With sparked interest in the song, radio stations began playing the studio version of "Pardon Me". In response, Incubus made a video for the song and released a six-song EP titled ''[[When Incubus Attacks Volume 1|When Incubus Attacks (Vol. 1)]]'' on August 22, 2000. The EP contained the acoustic version of "Pardon Me". In its first week, the EP sold nearly 40,000 copies, and peaked at No. 41 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. To start off 2000, the band headed out on Tour with System of a Down, and [[Mr. Bungle]] until March, at which point they embarked on a headline tour in clubs until April.

Due to the success of "Pardon Me", ''Make Yourself'' reached Gold certification (500,000 copies sold) in April 2000. Incubus continued to tour overseas, and returned home at the end of May to go on a tour of the United States with longtime friends 311. "Stellar," the next single from the album was soon released, and its video received afternoon airplay on MTV and ''[[Total Request Live|TRL]],'' becoming a success on the Alternative chart. In July, Incubus were once again on the Ozzfest bill, until the late summer.

The band then took a short break after finishing the Ozzfest 2000 Tour, playing two acoustic shows at Artist Direct Studios. On October 5, 2000, ''Make Yourself'' went Platinum (one million copies sold), and shortly after, the band went on tour with [[Deftones]]. Sony re-released their independent debut album ''Fungus Amongus'' on November 7, 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.avclub.com/article/least-essential-albums-of-2000-1398|title=Least Essential Albums of 2000|date=December 13, 2000|website=Avclub.com|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref>

On November 20, 2000, the band released "Drive," the fourth single from ''Make Yourself'' after "Privilege" was released (which then went to the top 20 where it stayed at No. 3 for 6 weeks.) It moved quickly up to the top of the Alternative Charts, eventually hitting the No. 1 spot. The single was a success and helped the band break into the mainstream. The single eventually reached the top ten of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] singles chart.

After a ten-year break from the music business in 2000, thrash metal band [[Opprobrium (band)|Opprobrium]] (already formed in 1986) were forced to change their name in order to avoid confusion and a lawsuit.

===''Morning View'' (2001–2002)===
The band took a break during the first part of 2001 before heading to a beachside mansion in [[Malibu, California]], to record their follow-up album, which would later become known as ''[[Morning View]]''.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122162746/http://chartattack.com/DAMN/2001/10/2301.cfm "CD REVIEWS: Bush, Headstones, Incubus, Rheostatics and many more"]. ''Chart Attack'', October 23, 2001 By: Debbie Bento</ref>

They began touring once more with [[Hundred Reasons]] in Europe from June until the first week of July. At this time, the band was invited to play with the Area 1 Festival, which featured [[Moby]], [[Outkast]], [[the Roots]], [[Paul Oakenfold]], [[Carl Cox]], and [[Nelly Furtado]]. Also, in July, ''Make Yourself'' was certified double-platinum, selling 2 million copies. In August, the band got to play their first shows in Australia and Japan, before returning to the United States to begin their headlining tour with their long-time friends from California, [[Hoobastank]]. Meanwhile, the band's video for "Drive" was nominated for an [[MTV Video Music Award]] in the category of Best Group Video.

Continuing to tour, Incubus released their first single, "[[Wish You Were Here (Incubus song)|Wish You Were Here]]", from their upcoming record, ''Morning View'', on August 21, 2001. The single instantly began to climb up the [[Modern Rock|Alternative]] charts, reaching No. 2 by early September. The music video was released at the end of that month, after being re-cut to make it more viewable in the wake of the [[9/11]] disaster. The video earned viewings on MTV's TRL, [[VH1]], and [[MuchMusic]]. Their follow-up single was "Nice to Know You."

On October 23, 2001, the band released their fourth full-length major label album. The name was taken from the street on which the band's recording studio was situated. Incubus continued to headline dates after its release, and "Wish You Were Here" continued to sit among the top 10 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Alternative charts. ''Morning View'' debuted on the Billboard Top 200 at the No. 2 spot (266,000 copies were sold in its first week). This was the highest ever placement for Incubus. At the same time, "Wish You Were Here" was at No. 2 on the Alternative Charts, and "Drive" sat at No. 48 on the Hot 100 chart. The band won an award for Billboard's Alternative Single of the Year for "Drive". By December, ''Morning View'' was certified platinum, "Wish You Were Here" was No. 4 on Alternative charts, and ''Morning View'' was No. 38 on top 200.

On December 11, Incubus released ''When Incubus Attacks (Vol. 2)'', a [[DVD-Video]] that featured music videos for "Take Me to Your Leader", "A Certain Shade of Green", "Pardon Me", "Stellar", "Drive", "I Miss You", and "Summer Romance (Anti-Gravity Love Song)", live footage, backstage video, and more. Director Bill Draheim documented the making of "Drive". Save Me from my Half-Life Drive is the result of that edited EPK footage.

To begin 2002, Incubus was No. 9 with "Drive", No. 12 with "Stellar", No.  20 with "Wish You Were Here", No. 75 with "Nice To Know You" and No. 31 with the album ''Morning View''. On January 24, 2002, MTV's TRL premiered the "Nice to Know You" video, and Boyd called in from Europe where the band was on tour with [[311 (band)|311]] and [[Hoobastank]]. The band was then featured on MTV's ''Becoming'', TRL, ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and played the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on February 14, 2002, all before heading off to play dates in Japan and Australia for the remainder of February and March. While in Sydney, the band shot the video for their next single, "Warning", from March 7 until March 11.
The band then released the DVD ''[[The Morning View Sessions]]'' on May 28, shortly before playing the Weenie Roast on June 8 for KROQ.

Incubus issued a limited-edition version of ''Morning View'' on October 1 to coincide with their fall headlining tour. The new version of the album contained a DVD dubbed the "Morning After View Session". It featured the UK video for the group's track "Are You In?", tour footage, new artwork, behind-the-scenes material, and more. Incubus's last performance in 2002 (on November 1) brought several eras for the band to a close. Their last show of the tour would be their last show touring behind 2001's ''Morning View'', as the band looked on to playing new music. The show would also prove to be their last with bass player Dirk Lance, who left the band due to personal differences.

Lance was quietly replaced by former the Roots guitarist [[Ben Kenney]], who began working with Einziger on new songs for a psychedelic jazz-funk project called [[Time-Lapse Consortium]]. Incubus ended the year on the charts, having "Wish You Were Here" (#10), "Warning" (#16), and "Nice To Know You" (#26) on the alternative rock format chart, joining "Wish You Were Here" (#25) and "Nice To Know You" (#36). ''Morning View'' was the 40th-best-selling album of 2002.

===''A Crow Left of the Murder...'' (2003–2004)===
[[File:Brandon Boyd of Incubus live 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brandon Boyd]] in [[San Sebastián de los Reyes|San Sebastián]], Spain in 2004]]
On January 6, 2003, the band began writing for their next record. The next month, on February 7, the band began to renegotiate their record contract. The band, which had been signed to [[Epic Records|Epic]]/[[Immortal Records|Immortal]] for seven years, cited the fact that state law limits the amount of time that an artist can be bound to a company. The band had been signed to the label for 7 years, and used California's "Seven Years Law" as a negotiating tool with Epic/Immortal. After releasing three successful albums, the band had been compensated poorly compared to the revenue that they had generated for [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment|Sony]]. The band entered a lawsuit against their label in order to break from their contract, to which Sony responded with a lawsuit of their own.<ref name="latimes2003"/> On March 1, Einziger, along with [[Scott Litt]], Dave Holdredge, and Rick Will, was nominated for a [[Grammy]] in the "Best Engineered Album (Non Classical)" category, for their work on ''Morning View''. On April 3, after weeks of circulating rumors about Dirk Lance's departure from the band, an official announcement was made by the band. A decision had been reached amongst members of Incubus in a face-to-face meeting at the end of the ''Morning View'' tour to discuss his involvement in the band. The band said that the split had become necessary due to "irreconcilable creative differences".
Almost immediately after the announcement of a new bass player, the 2003 Incubus vs. Sony case had been settled. The two sides settled on a new contract that delivers three albums to Epic/Immortal with an option on a fourth. The first album would be worth $8&nbsp;million in advances to the band, with another $2.5&nbsp;million for each one thereafter.

[[File:Incubus (Logo).png|thumb|200px|right|The Incubus logo from the ''A Crow Left of the Murder...'' era]]
By December the new album, which was recorded at Southern Tracks Recording Studios in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] was recorded live, opposed to recording each instrument at separate times, and was produced by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] ([[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Stone Temple Pilots]]) was completed and scheduled for release. Titled ''[[A Crow Left of the Murder...]]'', the album was to be an [[enhanced CD]] with behind-the-scenes video. In the videos, Einziger and Boyd discussed their new songs. Einziger described them as "like the old shit, but older. It's very different. It's very energetic and fast, and a lot of it is more technical. I guess maybe in the vein of more of our older songs; they don't sound like our older songs. They are more exploratory." It was the last Incubus album to be labelled as "[[alternative metal]]" by the media,<ref name="newspaper">[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wPxJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mx4NAAAAIBAJ&pg=1319,1624724&dq=incubus+alternative-metal&hl=en Incubus Fail To Mature With Fifth Installment] Michigan Daily - February 10, 2004.

On December 15, 2003, the first single, "[[Megalomaniac (Incubus song)|Megalomaniac]]", was released. It raised controversy when it was said to be an attack on the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration, and was banned from daytime view on MTV (despite the band saying that it was not an attack on a particular person, rather a comment on some people's negative attitudes). However, the band was actually pleased with this nighttime viewing restriction. Says Boyd, "When we heard our video had been relegated to late night rotation, I think that all of us were secretly like, 'Yes!' ". Pasillas reflected Boyd's sentiments, saying, "I think it's okay if people think that we're trying to make a political statement. Whatever anyone conjures up or takes from our music is good; I mean, our point is to get people thinking."

''A Crow Left of the Murder...'' was released in 2004, showcasing a new turn for the band. The second single released was "Talk Shows on Mute", featuring a video that was inspired by [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''.

Incubus toured worldwide in 2004 with many bands, including [[Ben Kweller]], [[the Walkmen]], [[Hundred Reasons]], [[the Music]], [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] and [[Sparta (band)|Sparta]], to promote their new album after their original support act [[The Vines (band)|the Vines]] pulled out due to exhaustion.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wiederhorn |first=Jon |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1488281/vines-drop-off-incubus-tour.jhtml |title=Vines Drop Off Incubus Tour, Citing Exhaustion - Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=2004-06-09 |access-date=2013-03-07}}</ref> One song left off the album, the 27-minute-long instrumental entitled "The Odyssey", was later featured on soundtrack for the video game, ''[[Halo 2]]''.

In November 2004, the band released a live DVD entitled ''[[Alive at Red Rocks]]'', filmed in [[Red Rocks Park]], [[Colorado]], during their world tour for ''A Crow Left of the Murder...''. Along with the DVD came a bonus CD featuring five tracks, including a studio version of live favorite "Pantomime", "Follow" (a lyrical version, different from the First Movement of the Odyssey version), and the UK [[B-side]] "Monuments and Melodies". Two live tracks were also included. The performance was also sold in high definition via [[Blu-ray]] Disc. A high definition version of the entire song "[[Pardon Me]]" is also available for free download from the [[PlayStation Store]], an online service for [[PlayStation 3]] users.

In December 2004, at a gig in Los Angeles the band played [[the Police]] hits "[[De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da]]", "[[Message in a Bottle (The Police song)|Message in a Bottle]]" and "[[Roxanne (The Police song)|Roxanne]]" with [[Stewart Copeland]] and [[Andy Summers]] from the former band.

===''Light Grenades'' (2005–2008)===
[[File:Incubus live 2007 (1).jpg|thumb|210px|right|Incubus performing at the [[Virgin Festival]] in [[Baltimore]] in 2007]]
In the spring of 2005, the band went back into the studio with [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]. Three new songs were released in late July 2005 as part of the soundtrack album to the [[Sony Pictures Entertainment|Sony]] film ''[[Stealth (film)|Stealth]]''. The track ''[[Make a Move (Incubus song)|"Make a Move"]]'', was released to radio in late May, and song reached No. 17 (Alternative Charts) and No. 19 (Mainstream Rock Charts). Fan reaction towards "Make a Move" was lukewarm, but the other two new songs, "Admiration" and "Neither of Us Can See" (a duet with [[Chrissie Hynde]]), seemed to be much more well-liked. In January 2006, the first of a series of Incubus podcasts was released by the band via internet. Among other things, the podcast featured the band's thoughts about their 2005 South American tour, some information on their new album, a mash-up of "[[Drive (Incubus song)|Drive]]" and [[Tupac Shakur]]'s "[[Better Dayz]]", a cover of [[Soundgarden]]'s "[[Black Hole Sun]]", and a few live interludes.

On August 1, 2006, the band announced that album number six, ''[[Light Grenades]]'', was soon to be released and that it was being produced by Brendan O'Brien. A few weeks afterward, the release date was confirmed to be Tuesday, November 28. Upon release, ''Light Grenades'' debuted No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the first time Incubus has ever sat atop the album charts, despite only selling 165,000 copies (their lowest debut for an album since ''Make Yourself'') in the first week.

In November, Incubus played two exclusive European shows in Berlin and London. These were both in less than 2,000-capacity venues—a special occasion for the band and the fans (due to Incubus's mainstream success, the band now usually plays at large arenas worldwide). The band used these shows to showcase new material from ''Light Grenades''. The band's first single, "[[Anna Molly]]", had a music video which had mainstream success.

On December 27, 2006, Incubus launched the "I Dig Incubus" contest, in which participants cut together clips of the band performing their single "[[Dig (Incubus song)|Dig]]", to form a complete music video. On February 1, 2007, five finalists were announced for the "I Dig Incubus" contest. In a video interview on ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'', bassist and vocalist [[Ben Kenney]] said, "It's almost something that will happen whether or not we want to do it. People will make their own videos for songs. It's kind of a cool way for us to get together with fans out there who are artistic."<ref>{{cite news |title=Incubus: Exclusive Interview |publisher=Blender Magazine Online |url=http://www.blender.com/video/940/IncubusExclusiveInterview.video?src=GM7070:MD |access-date=February 20, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018075702/http://blender.com/video/940/IncubusExclusiveInterview.video?src=GM7070:MD |archive-date=October 18, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On August 4, 2007, Incubus played on the first day at [[Baltimore]]'s [[Virgin Festival]] along with bands such as [[the Police]] and [[Beastie Boys]].

Michael Einziger had been suffering from [[carpal tunnel syndrome]] and although he had an operation that has corrected the problem, he needed to recuperate for a few months, hence recent tour plans were postponed. Incubus apologized to fans and continued the tour in the summer and autumn.

In February and March 2008, Incubus hit the road again starting in New Zealand and headlining the [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]] festival in Australia alongside [[the Offspring]] and [[Alexisonfire]], and toured Asia performing to sell-out crowds. In Singapore, they met fans at a Meet and Greet session at Changi Airport and performed at Fort Canning Hill.
In April, Incubus performed at the [[Festival Imperial]] in Costa Rica, along with the bands [[the Smashing Pumpkins]] and [[Duran Duran]], and later in Venezuela at the [[Poliedro de Caracas]].
Incubus also performed a number of shows throughout Europe this summer including the [[Rock am Ring]] and [[Rock im Park]] Festivals in Germany, the [[Nova Rock Festival]] in Austria, [[Pinkpop Festival]] in the Netherlands and the [[Download Festival]] in England. In July 2008, the band played in a [[VH1]] tribute to [[the Who]] alongside [[Foo Fighters]], [[Pearl Jam]] and [[the Flaming Lips]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Incubus Performs on VH1's Rock Honors: The Who Show|url=http://blog.vh1.com/2008-06-13/incubus-celebrates-the-who-on-rock-honors/|work=VH1 Blog|date=June 13, 2008|access-date=June 18, 2008|archive-date=June 14, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614125311/http://blog.vh1.com/2008-06-13/incubus-celebrates-the-who-on-rock-honors/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Hiatus and greatest hits album (2009–2010)===
In April 2008 the band took a break from touring and recording while its members concentrated on school, family and other activities. Brandon Boyd enrolled in a university art program in Los Angeles, while guitarist Mike Einziger went to Harvard music school to study composition. Drummer José Pasillas was also "having a baby, so there's a lot of normal life stuff going on right now—school, babies, mortgages," Boyd said. "I'm of the mind to say it wouldn't be a bad thing to disappear for a year or two years," he said. "A lot of people would say culture moves too fast and you need to remind people, but I would argue there's not any rush."<ref>''Ultimate Guitar'', 2008. [http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/incubus_to_take_a_break.html Incubus To Take A Break].</ref>

In mid January 2009, Incubus posted a video to their official site, describing what each band member was currently occupied with in the form of letters to each other. The resolution of the video was that the band was planning on getting back together soon, excited to create new music with their diverse experiences over their respite.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enjoyincubus.com/ |title='Enjoy Incubus', 2009 |publisher=Enjoyincubus.com |access-date=2011-10-24}}</ref>

On March 11, 2009, Incubus posted an update to their official site detailing the new greatest hits album, ''[[Monuments and Melodies]].'' The first single for the album was "Black Heart Inertia," released on April 7, 2009 with the album coming two months later on June 16, 2009. Disc one of the album included new singles "Black Heart Inertia" and "Midnight Swim" as well as the top radio hits of the last decade. Then disc two of the album contains songs that have not been released officially on an album, or were rejected demos on prior albums, as well as an acoustic version of "A Certain Shade of Green," and a cover of the [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] song "Let's Go Crazy." The band also announced many confirmed dates for a Summer Amphitheater Tour of the US.

On April 1, 2009, the band posted a fake "making of" video that was filmed on the set of "Black Heart Inertia". In the video, Brandon and his double "swapped places". Brandon fetched coffee for his double, and his double also imitated [[Christian Bale]] when the DP annoyed him, shouting at and violently chasing him out off of the set. After the short film, the first full stream of "Black Heart Inertia" was uploaded, clocking in at 4:17. On April 2, the full song was streamed on the band's official site. The song peaked at No. 7 on the [[Hot Modern Rock Tracks|Alternative Songs]] chart,<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Alternative Airplay Chart: The week of June 27, 2009 |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-airplay/2009-06-27 |magazine=Billboard |url-access=subscription |access-date=April 19, 2021 |archive-date=April 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420024902/https://www.billboard.com/charts/alternative-airplay/2009-06-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> making it the band's 15th Top 10 standing on the list.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

On June 16, 2009, ''Monuments and Melodies'' was released to the public, and opened at No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200. ''Monuments and Melodies'' was the band's fourth album to reach the top 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200. The next month, on July 1, 2009, Boyd stated to ''North County Times'', "We are definitely going to be writing ... in hopes of putting out a record sometime in 2010. That's the hope. We can never force anything. I definitely have the suspicion that we're going to get on the road together this summer, and we're just going to start playing and stuff is going to start brewing, and we're going to light that fire again."

In January 2010, it was revealed that former turntablist [[Gavin Koppell|Gavin "DJ Lyfe" Koppell]] threatened current turntablist [[Chris Kilmore]] in a [[retailing|store]] on December 28, 2009. Kilmore, who replaced Gavin Koppell in 1998 claimed that Koppell, "asked me to fight him right there and raised his fists to me."<ref name="TMZ 011210">{{cite news|url=https://www.tmz.com/2010/01/12/new-incubus-dj-fears-old-incubus-dj/|title=New Incubus DJ Fears Old Incubus DJ|date=January 12, 2010|work=TMZ|access-date=August 2, 2010}}</ref> As result of the incident, a judge has granted a new [[restraining order]] against Koppell.

Mike has said that he is writing music for an orchestral project and also for Incubus. He states in a video (Mikey Gear Tour part II), "My hope is to just write lots of music and then by the time we get to the point to where we're going to finish the tour I'll have a lot of music written and then people won't have to wait five more years for another album (laughs)."

The band joined [[Linkin Park]] as co-headliners on the 2012 edition of the [[Honda Civic Tour]].

Guitarist Mike Einziger stated in 2017 that the band's diversity is "our greatest asset and our biggest flaw. We don't fit anywhere and we never have. We were never [[punk rock]] enough for the [[Warped Tour]], we were never metal enough for Ozzfest, we were never quite [[indie rock]] or cool enough for [[Lollapalooza]].

Prior to finding mainstream success in the early 2000s, Incubus were often grouped in with the [[nu metal|nu/alternative metal]] movement of the 1990s,<ref name="maui"/> alongside other Californian bands such as [[Korn]] and [[Deftones]]. When asked about his thoughts on the scene in a 2013 interview, Brandon Boyd reflected "Something I know that separated us from nu-metal was a lot of those bands had [[misogynist]] lyrics, and we never wrote stuff like that. I never wrote lyrics like that. I guess there were similarities in some of my musical and vocal stylings, but then we came off tour for ''S.C.I.E.N.C.E.'' around early '99, and wrote ''Make Yourself'', which was a vastly different album but we were still the same band. We don't try and create any kind of album really. I don't attempt to write any kind of music, this is just what comes out."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_au/article/we-interviewed-brandon-boyd-from-incubus|title=We Interviewed Brandon Boyd from Incubus |website=Noisey.vice.com|access-date=December 22, 2016}}</ref> The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' stated in 2001 that Incubus are "Cheerful, melodic and polite, a nu-metal band for people who don't like nu-metal bands" and also claimed that Boyd was the genre's "first official [[pin-up model|pinup boy]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2001-11-02/entertainment/0111020045_1_incubus-morning-view-brandon-boyd|title=Incubus: Good grooming to nu-metal|work=chicagotribune.com|access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' similarly wrote in 2004 that "Incubus always stood out from the rest of the mid-'90s alt-metal crowd, its positive lyrical approach and musical versatility far richer than the overworked wallowing in misery of such acts as Korn and later arrival [[Staind]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/19/news/wk-hochman19|title=They're agents of change|first=Steve|last=Hochman|date=August 19, 2004|access-date=January 27, 2019|newspaper=[[LA Times]]}}</ref>

We were listening to bands like Primus, Mr. Bungle, [[John Zorn]], we also got into Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine. What's amazing is those bands are still good now, they're still relevant now.
