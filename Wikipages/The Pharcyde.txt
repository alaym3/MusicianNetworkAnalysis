'''The Pharcyde''' is an American [[alternative hip hop]] group, formed in 1989, from [[South Los Angeles|South Central Los Angeles]]. The original four members of the group are Imani (Emandu Wilcox), [[Slimkid3]] (Trevant Hardson), Bootie Brown (Romye Robinson), and [[Fatlip]] (Derrick Stewart).<ref name=Coleman317>Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 317.</ref> DJ Mark Luv was the group's first [[disc jockey]] (DJ), followed by producer [[J-Swift]] and then [[J Dilla]]. The group is perhaps best known for the [[hit single]]s "[[Drop (The Pharcyde song)|Drop]]", "[[Passin' Me By]]" and "[[Runnin' (The Pharcyde song)|Runnin{{'-}}]]", as well as their first album, ''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'' (1992). The group continues to tour and record, both collaboratively and in solo projects—the most recent being Hardson's collaborative EP with [[DJ Nu-Mark]] (of [[Jurassic 5]]) released in 2014 on [[Delicious Vinyl]].<ref>{{cite web |title= SLIMKID3 & DJ NU-MARK VINYL LP / CD / DIGITAL |url= http://store.deliciousvinyl.com/products/slimkid3-dj-nu-mark-vinyl-lp-cd-digital |access-date= December 3, 2014 |archive-date= December 28, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141228195049/http://store.deliciousvinyl.com/products/slimkid3-dj-nu-mark-vinyl-lp-cd-digital |url-status= live }}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
Pharcyde group members [[Slimkid3]], Bootie Brown, and Imani met as dancers in the late 1980s and dancing was their main ambition as late as 1990.<ref name=Coleman317/> Around this time, Imani and [[Slimkid3]] were in a group called "As Is" and later a group called the "Play Brothers",<ref name=Coleman317/> while Bootie Brown was a backup dancer for [[Fatlip]]<ref name=Coleman317/> (Fatlip being the last member to join the group<ref name=Coleman318/>). Bootie Brown recalls that their earlier dancing careers influenced their [[rapping]] – "sometimes the way I rap is almost like the way I used to dance".<ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 113.</ref> The group met Reggie Andrews, a local high-school music teacher who worked with [[the Dazz Band]] and [[Rick James]], and who was a major musical influence on their debut album.<ref name=Coleman318>Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''.

''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 319.</ref> Before group settled on the name "The Pharcyde", they were almost called "The Rappers" and "True Jiggaboo", the second of which served as inspiration for their interlude "Jiggaboo Time".<ref>{{cite web |title=Hip Hop Group THE PHARCYDE on theFIVE10 Radio |url=https://thefive10.com/2010/08/08/hip-hop-group-the-pharcyde-on-thefive10-radio/ |publisher=The Five10 Radio |website=thefive10.com |access-date=February 11, 2020 |date=August 8, 2010 |archive-date=August 10, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200810114514/https://thefive10.com/2010/08/08/hip-hop-group-the-pharcyde-on-thefive10-radio/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===''Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde''===
The Pharcyde recorded their first demo in 1991, which contained the songs "[[Passin' Me By]]", "Ya Mama", and "Officer",<ref name=Coleman320>Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 320.</ref> and hired a manager, [[Paul Stewart (music supervisor)|Paul Stewart]], who had worked for [[Cypress Hill]], [[De La Soul]], and [[House of Pain]].<ref name=Coleman320/> Mike Ross of [[Delicious Vinyl]] heard the demo and the group was signed to the label in the summer of 1991<ref name=Coleman320/> – they were first featured on [[Brand New Heavies]]'s album ''[[Heavy Rhyme Experience, Vol. 1]]'', on the song "Soul Flower", released by [[Delicious Vinyl]] in 1992.<ref name=Coleman320/>

The group, along with producer [[J-Swift]], recorded their first album ''[[Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde]]'', which was released in September 1992.<ref name=allmusicbizarre>{{cite web |last=Bush |first=John |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/bizarre-ride-ii-the-pharcyde-mw0000097245 |title=Bizarre Ride II the Pharcyde - The Pharcyde : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=December 22, 2012 |archive-date=April 6, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130406060423/http://www.allmusic.com/album/bizarre-ride-ii-the-pharcyde-mw0000097245 |url-status=live }}</ref> The album was certified Gold by the [[RIAA]] in 1996.<ref name=Coleman323>Coleman, Brian. ''[[Check The Technique]]: Liner Notes For Hip-Hop Junkies''. New York: Villard/Random House, 2007, p. 323.</ref> The album was highly acclaimed, and became one of the most praised and influential [[alternative hip hop]] albums of the 1990s.<ref>Shapiro, Peter, 2005, The Rough Guide To Hip-Hop, 2nd Edition, Penguin, p. 301.</ref><ref>Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art & Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 332.</ref>

Their second single "[[Passin' Me By]]" became a minor ''Billboard'' hit, peaking at No. 52 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]. The song was later featured in the hit movie ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' and was also a crossover [[modern rock]] hit.<ref>{{cite web|title=''Big Daddy''|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142342/soundtrack|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=December 22, 2012|archive-date=April 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130425004600/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142342/soundtrack|url-status=live}}</ref> The song is now usually considered a golden-era staple and is the group's most well known song.{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} The album featured a couple of guest MCs, including Bucwheed (known then as Buckwheat, formerly of the alternative hip-hop group The Wascals) on the tracks "On The DL" and "I'm That Type of Nigga".<ref>Coleman, Brian.

About the group's sense of humor, Imani was quoted in a 1993 interview saying "We find humor in things other people don’t. Everyday situations. People might look at things around here and say, like, ‘Damn!’ We say, ‘Hah, hah, hah.’ We just chill out."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hochman |first1=Steve |title=Thrillin' 'n' Chillin': Life With the Pharcyde |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-13-ca-12684-story.html |website=[[Los Angeles Times]] |access-date=February 11, 2020 |date=July 13, 1993 |archive-date=February 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200212071526/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-07-13-ca-12684-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Problems between the group and producer [[J-Swift]] began during the recording of the debut, with infighting and "personality conflicts".<ref name=Coleman323/>web|last=Ryon|first=Sean|title=DX News Bits: J-Swift, Celph Titled|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com

After the ''Bizarre Ride'' album was released, the group began touring with [[A Tribe Called Quest]] and [[De La Soul]], culminating with an appearance at the [[Lollapalooza]] show in 1994.<ref name=allmusic/>

In 1994, Pharcyde appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation album, ''[[Stolen Moments: Red Hot + Cool]]''. The album, meant to raise awareness and funds in support of the AIDS epidemic in relation to the African American community, was heralded as "Album of the Year" by ''[[Time Magazine]]''.

Before the success of ''Bizarre Ride,'' the group moved to Inglewood, CA, where they shared a home dubbed the Pharcyde Manor. Lew of DIRT magazine reports of the Manor, "...you can tell their laid-back style meeting rapid-fire rhyme delivery is a product of the virtual telepathic rapport that only comes from eating, sleeping and breathing under the same roof."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=-|first=Lew|date=1993|title=Home|url=https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7489q3mv/|journal=DIRT Magazine|type=Zine|volume=5|via=Online Archive of California; University of California, Los Angeles Library Special Collections|access-date=November 1, 2019|archive-date=November 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101170349/https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt7489q3mv/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''Labcabincalifornia''===
In 1995, The Pharcyde released their second album, ''[[Labcabincalifornia]]''. The album received mixed reviews upon release, maybe due to a different musical direction from the light-hearted playfulness of their debut. The album included another big crossover hit, "[[Runnin' (The Pharcyde song)|Runnin{{'-}}]]", peaking at No. 35 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chart History - The Pharcyde - Runnin |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/the-pharcyde/chart-history/r-b-hip-hop-songs/song/330563 |publisher=Billboard |website=www.billboard.com |access-date=February 11, 2020}}</ref> This single was later featured in the movie ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', as well as the ''[[8 Mile (soundtrack)|More Music from 8 Mile]]'' soundtrack. ''Labcabincalifornia'' featured production from producers [[J Dilla|Jay Dee]] (who handled the majority of the production). Member Slimkid3 has stated that the group met Jay Dee by way of [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] of [[A Tribe Called Quest]], who handed them the tape that contained some of the production that would end up on the LP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theurbandaily.com/2270297/the-pharcyde-bizarre-ride-20-years-later-exclusive/4/|title=The Pharcyde Recall Their "Bizarre Ride" 20 Years Later [EXCLUSIVE]|date=April 24, 2013|access-date=February 6, 2017|archive-date=February 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207113205/https://theurbandaily.com/2270297/the-pharcyde-bizarre-ride-20-years-later-exclusive/4/|url-status=live}}</ref> This album generated lower sales, not reaching gold status. A music video for the song "[[Drop (The Pharcyde song)|Drop]]" was directed by [[Spike Jonze]].

Problems grew between Fatlip and the other MCs after this album, resulting in his leaving the group.  In the documentary ''Cydeways: The Best of the Pharcyde'', while the group is performing in shows they still offer their support to Fatlip, telling the crowd that if they support Fatlip on his solo career then they support The Pharcyde and vice versa.

===1997–2000===
The group was largely missing from the hip hop scene between 1997 and 1999. The three remaining members returned in 2000 with an EP titled ''Chapter One: Testing the Waters''.

The group released a full studio album later in 2000 titled ''[[Plain Rap]]''. The album had a lukewarm reception both critically and commercially.

Soon after the release, member Slimkid3, now going by his birth name of Tre Hardson, left the group to pursue a solo career. In 2002, he released his first solo album titled ''Liberation''.

===2001–2004: ''Humboldt Beginnings''===
With only two members remaining, Bootie Brown and Imani continued with the group name and released ''[[Humboldt Beginnings]]'' in 2004. The album received even less attention critically and commercially than their last effort. This album introduced Schmooche Cat and Spaceboy Boogie X as new members and Spaceboy Boogie X as producer to the group.

The album was released on the group's own independent record label, Chapter One Entertainment.

===Touring===
[[File:The Pharcyde in Dublin.jpg|thumb|The Pharcyde performing at The Village club in [[Dublin]] on March 17, 2006]]
Though ''[[Humboldt Beginnings]]'' is to date the last Pharcyde album, its members have since been keeping busy with various contributions and projects. A compilation of The Pharcyde was released in 2005, titled ''[[Sold My Soul: The Remix & Rarity Collection]]'', featuring a number of remixes and rare songs.  Former member Fatlip released his solo debut in 2005, titled ''[[The Loneliest Punk]]'', and Tre Hardson's second full-length solo album ''SLIMKID3's Cafe'' was released on April 4, 2006.

In late 2007, Tre toured with L.A. Latin-funk-hip hop band [[Ozomatli]] on their Winter Tour throughout the United States.

The Pharcyde and [[Souls of Mischief]] collaborated to form a group called "Almyghty Myghty Pythons" and released a collaboration album entitled ''Almyghty Myghty Pythons''. Production from the group died down, but it was said by Imani in an interview that it was to be an ongoing project.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/6/6344/1/ |title=Pharcyde - "A New Beginning" |publisher=HipHop-Elements.com |access-date=December 22, 2012 |archive-date=January 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118002756/http://www.hiphop-elements.com/article/read/6/6344/1/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Fatlip and Tre Hardson reunited to perform on 'The Over 30, Dirty Old Men Tour'.<ref>[http://www.fatlipandslimkidtre.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316080642/http://www.fatlipandslimkidtre.com/ |date=March 16, 2013 }}</ref> Fatlip and Tre Hardson were featured on the song "All I Want for Christmas (Is Somebody Else)" featuring St. Imey (formerly of The Wascals) and produced by [[J-Swift]] on [[Delicious Vinyl]] records.

In 2005, Bootie Brown made a guest appearance on [[Gorillaz]]' single "[[Dirty Harry (song)|Dirty Harry]]", from the album ''[[Demon Days]]''. The verse was a narrative of a soldier on the frontlines in Iraq. He often filled in for rapper [[Mos Def]] on the [[Gorillaz]]' song "[[Stylo (song)|Stylo]]" on the group's [[Escape to Plastic Beach World Tour]] and at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 2010.

On April 22, 2008 it was announced that The Pharcyde would be reuniting for the annual Rock the Bells Festival Series. The first performance was Saturday, July 19 in Chicago.<ref>[http://www.guerillaunion.com/rockthebells/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422145416/http://www.guerillaunion.com/rockthebells/ |date=April 22, 2008 }}</ref>

Remixes of The Pharcyde's "Runnin{{'"}} and "Passin' Me By" appear on Delicious Vinyl's 2008 release, ''Rmxxology''.

The Pharcyde toured Australia in February 2009 as part of the [[Good Vibrations Festival]], which was headlined by Fatboy Slim, and played in Sydney, Melbourne, Gold Coast and Perth.  They also headlined at the [[All Points West Festival]] in Liberty State Park, NJ on July 31, 2009.

The Pharcyde also reunited at Rhymesayers Entertainment's soundset, Memorial Day Weekend, 2009, and were the co-headliners of the festival, which was also headlined by Atmosphere and featured many other underground artists.

Uncle Imani went on FIVE10 Radio<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefive10.com/show-archive/2010/8/8/hip-hop-group-the-pharcyde-on-thefive10-radio.html |title=Hip Hop Group THE PHARCYDE on theFIVE10 Radio « |publisher=Thefive10.com |date=August 8, 2010 |access-date=December 22, 2012}}</ref> to talk about the story behind the growth and demise of The Pharcyde.

The downfall of The Pharcyde was named the 26th (out of 30) worst fall-offs in hip hop history by ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' magazine in December 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.complex.com/music/2012/12/the-30-worst-fall-offs-in-rap-history/the-pharcyde |title=26.

2012 saw the twentieth anniversary of The Pharcyde's debut ''Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde'', and to mark the event Fatlip and SlimKid3 teamed up with the album's producers, J-Sw!ft and L.A. Jay, as well as record label Delicious Vinyl, to play the album in its entirety at a tribute show at The Roxy Theatre in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bizarreridelive.com/|title=Bizarre Ride Live Website|publisher=Bizarre Ride Live|access-date=July 1, 2013|archive-date=August 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130801111642/http://bizarreridelive.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> The performance was intended to be a one-off, but due to an overwhelming success and reception,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://larecord.com/live-reviews/2012/06/05/bizarre-ride-ii-the-pharcyde-live-the-roxy |title=Bizarre Ride II The Pharcyde Live |publisher=L.A.

In December of that year, The Pharcyde released the [[Amerigo Gazaway]]-produced "Still Got Love (Bizarre Tribe Megamix)" garnering significant praise.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kevinnottingham.com/2012/12/26/the-pharcyde-x-gummy-soul-still-got-love-bizarre-tribe-megamix/ |title=The Pharcyde x Gummy Soul: Still Got Love [Bizarre Tribe Megamix] |publisher=Kevin Nottingham |date=December 26, 2012 |access-date=January 10, 2013 |archive-date=September 11, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911083028/http://www.kevinnottingham.com/2012/12/26/the-pharcyde-x-gummy-soul-still-got-love-bizarre-tribe-megamix/ |url-status=live }}</ref> 2015 marked the twentieth anniversary of ''Labcabincalifornia'', resulting in a similar tour through Europe and Japan. The group continued touring Europe through 2017.

==Current==
In 2020, it was rumored that all 4 members would reunite on wax after a 25 year hiatus. Speculation that the reunion would appear on Fatlip’s next project gained traction fast. The whisperings were confirmed when the official Pharcyde Instagram page posted a story claiming a Pharcyde reunion was in the works. With Fatlip working on his project “Sccit & Doggy Present... Torpor: Still Sleepin”, his album is the most likely destination for the reunion to take place. Although a reunion on wax has been cemented, an entire album has yet to be confirmed.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.illuminati2g.com/untouchable/2021/06/fatlip-readies-new-solo-lp-i2ghiphop-exclusive/ |title=Fatlip Readies New Album Amidst Pharcyde Reunion |publisher=Illuminati2G |date=June 1, 2021 |access-date=June 1, 2021 |archive-date=June 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210602004214/https://www.illuminati2g.com/untouchable/2021/06/fatlip-readies-new-solo-lp-i2ghiphop-exclusive/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
