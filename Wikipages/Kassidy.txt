'''Kassidy''' are a Scottish alternative [[folk rock]] band. The band consist of [[Barrie-James O'Neill]] (vocals, piano and guitar), Hamish Fingland (vocals and guitar), Lewis Andrew (vocals, guitar, accordion and keyboard) and Chris Potter (vocals and guitar). The band was formed in late 2009 in [[Glasgow]].

The quartet met through friends' bands and fortunate pub encounters.
Kassidy began writing and recording their music in a [[Share housing|share house]], which they later converted to a personal studio. They released three [[Extended play|EP's]], the second entitled ''The Rubbergum EP Volume 2'' on 16 August 2010.

To follow their EPs, Kassidy released their debut [[album]], ''[[Hope St.]]'', on 21 March 2011.  They released their second album, ''[[One Man Army (Kassidy album)|One Man Army]]'', on 30 April 2012.

The band toured along with [[Lana Del Rey]] from 3 April 2013 to 31 May 2013 on her [[Paradise Tour]] in Europe. The same year, the frontman [[Barrie-James O'Neill]] collaborated with Del Rey on a cover of "[[Summer Wine]]" originally composed by [[Lee Hazlewood]], and appeared in its music video with Del Rey.

On 8 April 2013 the band released an EP album titled ''People Like Me'' on iTunes.

On 1 February 2014, the founder and frontman of the band, [[Barrie-James O'Neill]], left the band to move to Los Angeles to be with his then girlfriend, Lana Del Rey, and has since adopted the stage name "Nightmare Boy" as a solo artist. He has released two singles and an EP under that moniker. The band continued for a short while but split later that year. The remaining members have since formed a new band called White, along with Leo Condie and Kirstin Lynn.<ref>{{cite news|author=Paul Lester |url=http://theguardian.com/music/2015/may/22/new-band-of-the-week-white-no-54 |title=New band of the week: White (No 54) &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2020-03-02}}</ref>

On 15 March 2021 the band announced a new single "Don't Worry" to be released on 22 March 2021. This was to coincide with the release of a vinyl edition of their first album and the promotion of a special event to be performed in December 2021, to celebrate the 10th anniversary of their debut. In 2021 he debuted his album Strange desire on which he features song Riverside, duet with Lana Del Rey.
