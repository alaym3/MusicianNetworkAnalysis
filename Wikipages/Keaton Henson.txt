==History==

===Early life and career beginnings (1988–2012)===

Keaton Henson was born in 1988 in London, England. He is the son of actor [[Nicky Henson]] and ballet dancer [[Marguerite Porter]], and the half-brother of composer [[Christian Henson]].<ref name="guardian">{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/17/keaton-henson-birthdays-interview | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Lamont | title=Keaton Henson: 'Playing live? I have trouble just holding a conversation' | date=17 February 2013}}</ref>

Henson began his career as an illustrator. He designed the artwork for various albums including [[Dananananaykroyd]]'s ''[[Hey Everyone!]]'' and [[Enter Shikari]]'s ''[[Take to the Skies]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Keaton+Henson#t=Credits_All&q=&p=1|title=Keaton Henson credits|publisher=Discogs|date= |accessdate=17 May 2013}}</ref> Henson recorded songs in his apartment in London, initially purely for his own consumption. He gave a recording of one of the songs as a gift to his best friend,<ref name="baeblemusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.baeblemusic.com/artist/Keaton-Henson|title=Keaton Henson Biography|publisher=Baeble Music|date= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> and was encouraged to put music online.<ref name="guardian" /> In November 2010 his debut album ''Dear...'' was released on Motive Sounds Recordings, in a self-made limited edition.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/03/keaton-henson-fame-stage-fright | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Robbie | last=Wojciechowski | title=Keaton Henson: fame, stage fright and the discomfort of strangers | date=3 October 2012}}</ref> In 2011 he released a single, "Metaphors", on Porchlight Records. He also recorded "Don't Be Afraid" for the ''[[Tormented (2009 British film)|Tormented]]'' soundtrack.

Henson's musical breakthrough came when [[Zane Lowe]] played "You Don't Know How Lucky You Are" on [[BBC Radio 1]] for the first time on 7 September 2011, saying: "That piece of music right there ... is one of the most special pieces of music I've heard in a very very long time". Lowe said that the reaction from listeners had been 'brilliant'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRYC_FuTvIA|title=Zane Lowe YouTube clip|publisher=Motive Sounds|date=8 September 2011|accessdate=24 May 2013}}</ref>

Henson formed his own record company, Oak Ten Records, and officially re-released his debut album ''Dear...'' in 2012.<ref name="baeblemusic" /> The album was critically acclaimed: the [[BBC]] reported "Keaton Henson isn't a show-off, but with talent like this, he has every right to be".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/3wrj|title=BBC Dear... Review|publisher=BBC|date= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> On [[Metacritic]] the album received a score of 70 out of 100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/dear/keaton-henson|title=Metacritic Dear... Score|website=Metacritic|accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> ''Dear...'' didn't enter the charts but from it three singles were released– "Charon", "Small Hands" and "You Don't Know How Lucky You Are" – all of which were accompanied by music videos. The video for "Charon" was shortlisted for a UK MVA award in Best Budget Indie/Rock Category.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cargocollective.com/johnmalcolmmoore/Keaton-Henson-Charon|title=John Malcolm Moore director info|publisher=Cargo Collective|date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref> "Small Hands" won Best Music Video at the [[Rushes Soho Shorts Film Festival]] in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.promonews.tv/2012/07/25/keaton-hensons-small-hands-by-joseph-mann-wins-best-music-video-at-rushes-soho-shorts-2012/|title=Promo News piece|publisher=Promo News|date= |accessdate=20 May 2013}}</ref>

===''Birthdays'' and further projects (2013–2020)===

Henson wrote and recorded his second album, ''[[Birthdays (album)|Birthdays]]'', in less than a year. He travelled to California to record the album and worked with American producer [[Joe Chiccarelli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roughtrade.com/events/2013/2/41|title=Rough Trade Events, Keaton Henson|publisher=Rough Trade|date= |accessdate=8 May 2013}}</ref> and it was released in February 2013. The [[BBC]] said of the album: "Up there, warmed by the fire, he's cloistered away from Twitter and all the other evils of this parish. There's no better way to shut out the din than by putting this record on".<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/f828 BBC – Music – Review of Keaton Henson – Birthdays<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> A limited edition version of the album was released featuring three bonus songs and a hand-painted piece of art taken from a large painting by Henson which had been cut into 196 pieces. ''Birthdays'' spawned three singles: "Lying to You", "Sweetheart, What Have You Done To Us", and "You" (released as a limited edition 7" single for [[Record Store Day]] with an etching by Henson on the b-side). The album was also released as a limited book edition, featuring illustrations made by different artists accompanying the songs.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLNFObUiEr0&list=PLwfycmu7XM-T-JH1-koRsyW6TKE-_sQMS |title=Keaton Henson - Beekeeper (with illustration by Lynnie Zulu) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2013-04-02 |accessdate=2020-05-20}}</ref>

In 2012 and 2013, Henson performed sporadically, usually in small venues, galleries or museums.
