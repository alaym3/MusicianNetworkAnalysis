'''OMC''', or '''Otara Millionaires Club''', were a New Zealand music group, then duo, with vocalist [[Pauly Fuemana]] later becoming the sole member.<ref name="SimG">{{cite book |last1=Grigg |first1=Simon |title=How Bizarre: Pauly Fuemana and the Song That Stormed the World |date=2015 |publisher=Awa Press}}</ref> OMC was best known for the 1995 hit "[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]", named one of the greatest New Zealand songs of all time by the [[Australasian Performing Right Association]]. The full name of the band is a [[tongue-in-cheek]] reference to [[Ōtara]]'s status as one of the poorest suburbs of [[Auckland]].

==Career==
===Origin (1992–1995)===
The Otara Millionaires Club was formed in 1992 by [[Phil Fuemana]], who had played in the bands Houseparty and Fuemana.<ref name=dp>{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Field|title=Pauly Fuemana: Otara's star flared but briefly |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/national/obituaries/3299537/Pauly-Fuemana-Otaras-star-flared-but-briefly|work=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|Dominion Post]]|publisher=[[Scoop.co.nz]]|date=8 February 2010 |access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref> Fuemana and his younger brother [[Pauly Fuemana]] recorded two tracks as the new band for producer Alan Jansson's Urban Pacifica collection ''[[Proud (compilation)|Proud]]''.<ref name=dp/> Jansson had achieved cult status as composer/producer for the synthpop group Body Electric during the early 1980s.<ref>[https://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/alan-jansson Audioculture - Alan Jansson profile]</ref>
In 1994, after the split of the Otara Millionaires Club, Pauly approached Jansson and the two formed a musical partnership, with Fuemana the public face and Jansson as producer and co-writer.<ref name="SimG"></ref> Pauly suggested that they shorten the band's name to just the initials, and thereafter, Fuemana Jansson were OMC.<ref name="SimG"></ref> Pauly performed as OMC, serving as the frontman and playing several instruments during performances. However, the music was created by Pauly and Alan Jansson, with Jansson co-writing all of the tracks and handling most of the arrangement and all production duties in the studio.<ref name="nzcharts" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=OMC - AudioCulture|url=https://www.audioculture.co.nz/people/omc|access-date=2021-02-10|website=www.audioculture.co.nz|language=en}}</ref><ref name="SimG"></ref>

===''How Bizarre'' (1995–1997)===
Signed to [[Simon Grigg]]'s Huh! label, OMC released the single "[[How Bizarre (song)|How Bizarre]]" in New Zealand in late 1995. It was an immediate smash hit even without a video, reaching number one in early 1996 and staying there for three weeks. It sold over 35,000 copies.

The same year, "How Bizarre" went to number one in Australia for five weeks, sold over 150,000 singles, and was certified as a platinum single. Later in the year the single went to number 5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

In the United States, "How Bizarre" spent 32 weeks on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart, peaking at [[List of Mainstream Top 40 number-one hits of 1997 (U.S.)|number one in August 1997]] due to the large amount of radio play it received. This made OMC the first New Zealand artist to reach the number one spot on a ''Billboard'' chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pop songs - week of August 16, 1997|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/1997-08-16/pop-songs|work=Billboard|access-date=16 April 2012}}</ref> The song never charted on the regular [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] as it was not released as a commercially available single the US, which was a chart-eligibility requirement at the time. It also became a BMI-certified "million airplay" song two years in a row.

OMC's third single, "On the Run", reached number 56 on the UK in 1997.<ref name="UK"/>

In 1996, OMC's debut album, also entitled ''[[How Bizarre (album)|How Bizarre]]'', was released.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The album sold in the United States in excess of a million copies, and charted in many other countries. Between 1995 and 2000, world-wide OMC sales are estimated at between three and four million records.

===Follow-up success (1997–2010)===
"How Bizarre" was followed by the singles "Land of Plenty" which reached the top 5 in the New Zealand charts; "Right On" which achieved platinum-status in New Zealand; and "On The Run" which was a minor international hit in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. By 1998, Fuemana and Jansson had a falling out over [[royalties]], which ended up in court. It was resolved in arbitration with Fuemana paying a sum to Jansson and Jansson handing over all claim to the name and ongoing artist royalties.<ref name="SimG"></ref>

Fuemana and Jansson regrouped in 2005 and released the single "4 All of Us", featuring the actress [[Lucy Lawless]] as a guest vocalist, in 2007.

In 2002, their song "How Bizarre" reached #71 on the ''100 Greatest One-hit Wonders'' hosted by [[William Shatner]].

===Death of Pauly and Phil===
[[Phil Fuemana|Phil]] died in 2005 of a heart attack.

On 31 January 2010, Pauly Fuemana died at North Shore Hospital in [[Auckland]] after suffering for several years from a chronic degenerative disease, [[polyneuropathy|progressive demyelinating polyneuropathy]], an auto-immune disorder similar to the nerve disease [[multiple sclerosis]]. He was 40 years old, and was survived by his wife and six children. In February 2010, "How Bizarre" briefly reentered the charts in New Zealand following news of Pauly Fuemana's death.<ref name="TVNZ_3346027">{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/entertainment-news/bizarre-s-pauly-fuemana-dies-3346027 |title=How Bizarre singer Pauly Fuemana dies |date=31 January 2010 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |access-date=1 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=OMC - HOW BIZARRE (SONG)|url=https://charts.nz/showitem.asp?interpret=OMC&titel=How+Bizarre&cat=s|website=charts.nz|publisher=Hung Medien|access-date=10 September 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=OMC - New Zealand Musicians & Bands|url=https://www.muzic.net.nz/artists/720/omc|access-date=2021-02-10|website=www.muzic.net.nz}}</ref>
