'''Karnivool''' is an Australian [[progressive rock]] band formed in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] in 1997. The group currently consists of Ian Kenny on vocals, Drew Goddard and Mark Hosking on guitar, Jon Stockman on bass, and Steve Judd on drums. Karnivool emerged from a band Kenny and Goddard formed during high school. They have released three studio albums to date.

==History==
===1997–2003: Early years===
Karnivool developed from a high school band formed in 1997 in [[Perth, Western Australia]], which played parties using a set of [[cover version]]s of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]] songs, with some original compositions also included. By 1998 [[lead singer]] Ian Kenny changed their set to entirely original songs, removed all of the early band members and officially named the band Karnivool, derived from a local anecdotal description that the original members were "a bunch of clowns".<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p873629/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Karnivool - Biography|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Macrovision]]|last=MacGregor|first=Jodie|access-date=8 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toolian.com/other-bands-156/cracking-q-karnivools-guitarist-45024/|title=Cracking Q&A with Karnivool's guitarist|access-date=21 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717072622/http://www.toolian.com/other-bands-156/cracking-q-karnivools-guitarist-45024/|archive-date=17 July 2011}}</ref>

Between 1997 and 2004, the band underwent a number of line-up changes. The 1998 incarnation of Karnivool consisted of Kenny on lead vocals, Andrew 'Drew' Goddard on [[lead guitar]], Andrew Brown on [[bass guitar|bass]] and Brett McKenzie on [[drum kit|drums]]. In 2000, Brown was replaced by Jon Stockman and, shortly after, McKenzie also left and Ray Hawking joined on drums. Mark Hosking joined as rhythm guitarist in 2003 and in late 2004 Steve Judd replaced Hawking. As of 2004, the band's line-up consists of Kenny, Goddard, Hosking, Stockman, and Judd.

In 1999 the band released its debut self-titled [[Extended play|EP]] ''Karnivool''. This consisted of four tracks: "Fool Me", "Konkrete Seed", "Box" and "Some More of the Same". This EP did not receive a significant amount of recognition, with many stores and archives listing their second EP ''[[Persona (Karnivool EP)|Persona]]'', released in March 2001, as their first record. ''Persona'' consists of four new tracks and a re-release of the song "Some More of the Same" from the first EP.

After releasing ''Persona'', the band won the Western Australian State Final of the [[National Campus Band Competition]] and competed in the National Finals held in [[Hobart, Tasmania]]. In October 2001, the band were chosen to support the [[Rollins Band]] but, due to the [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] collapse, [[Henry Rollins]] and his band were forced to cancel their Perth show. At the end of 2001, the band played a support set for [[Fear Factory]].

===2004–2007: ''Themata''===
Goddard wrote the tracks for Karnivool's first album ''[[Themata (album)|Themata]]'' and he stated that they played songs from ''Themata'' together as a band only after it was recorded.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/perthnow/confidential/biographies/index/0,,5014259,00.html|title=Karnivool - PerthNow|work=The Sunday Times|publisher=News Corporation|access-date=9 October 2009}}</ref> Produced by [[Forrester Savell]], Goddard not only wrote all of the album's songs and played guitar, but also played drums on every track except "L1fel1ke", as Judd had not yet joined the band.<ref>[http://www.bielerbros.com/hot_seat.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070731043210/http://www.bielerbros.com/hot_seat.php |date=31 July 2007 }}</ref> ''Themata'' was released independently on 7 February 2005, and was distributed via [[MGM Distribution]].  On 23 August 2006, Karnivool signed a licensing deal with [[Bieler Bros. Records]], a US [[indie label]]. The album was issued in the US on 10 April 2007 and in the UK on 7 May. The band also re-released the ''Persona'' EP on 12 December 2007, following the success of ''Themata''.

Karnivool completed the 'Homeland Security Tour' shortly after the release of ''Themata''. In late 2007, they played with the 'Great American Rampage Tour' in [[North America]]. During this time frame, Karnivool also contributed a cover of [[Gotye]]'s song "The Only Way" to the album ''[[Mixed Blood (album)|Mixed Blood]]'', which contains covers and remixes of songs from Gotye's ''[[Boardface]]'' and ''[[Like Drawing Blood]]'' albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicaustralia.org/apps/MA?function=showDetail&currentBibRecord=000042101716&itemSeq=NaN&total=&returnFunction=viewTheme&&sessionId=|title=Mixed Blood / Goyte|publisher=Music Australia|access-date=9 October 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604050242/http://www.musicaustralia.org/apps/MA?function=showDetail&currentBibRecord=000042101716&itemSeq=NaN&total=&returnFunction=viewTheme&&sessionId=|archive-date=4 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> It does not feature on any Karnivool albums. Goddard and Stockman also played guitar and bass respectively on the title track of the 2005 album ''[[Hold Your Colour]]'', by Perth/London group [[Pendulum (drum and bass band)|Pendulum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pendulum-Hold-Your-Colour/release/494991|title=Pendulum - Hold Your Colour|publisher=[[Discogs]]|access-date=9 October 2009}}</ref>

===2008–2010: ''Sound Awake''===
After touring in the US, Karnivool returned to Australia in 2008 and subsequently entered the studio to write their follow-up to ''Themata''.  Goddard stated that the new album ''[[Sound Awake]]'' would be a huge progression from ''Themata'', while Stockman stated that the writing process of the new record was a collaborative effort by the band, in contrast to their previous work. Karnivool disclosed their new recording strategy for the second album: try to focus less on minute details and record a more natural-sounding album.<ref>{{cite news|title=Karnivool tap into metal market|url=http://wannerooweekender.inmycommunity.com.au/going-out/gig-guide/Karnivool-tap-into-metal-market/7528529/|publisher=Community Newspapers|work=Wanneroo Weekender|date=22 June 2009|last=Wilkinson|first=Christian|access-date=9 October 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003202630/http://wannerooweekender.inmycommunity.com.au/going-out/gig-guide/Karnivool-tap-into-metal-market/7528529/|archive-date=3 October 2009}}</ref> The album was again produced and mixed by Savell.

The band continued to tour Australia, including the [[Big Day Out]] tour, [[Pyramid Rock Festival]], Southbound and [[Homebake]]. During their live performances for the Aeons Tour, they played some of the new songs from the album, such as "Goliath", "Deadman", "Pearogram" (All I Know) and "New Day".  At [[Homebake]] in 2008 they debuted a fifth new song entitled "[[Set Fire to the Hive]]", which was confirmed as the first single from the album. The new songs were considered more mature, while still bearing resemblance to the band's previous work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessallareas.net.au/artists/Karnivool.php|title=Artist Profile: Karnivool|publisher=Access All Areas|last=Seng|first=Jarred|access-date=8 December 2008}}</ref>

The band toured Australia in support of ''Sound Awake'', followed by shows in New Zealand and then the US to headline 'Third Eye Gathering' in [[Los Angeles]]. The band then toured the UK in September and October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=46537# |title=Dead by April and Karnivool to support Skindred in the U.K.|publisher=Metal Underground.com|date=25 July 2009|access-date=8 October 2009}}</ref> On 9 November 2009, Karnivool published a music video on [[YouTube]] for their second single "All I Know".

''Sound Awake'' was released by [[Sony Music|Sony Music Independent Network]]/[[RED Distribution|RED]] in the US and Canada on 16 February 2010. Karnivool followed the release with a co-headlining US tour with [[Fair to Midland]].

After a successful tour of Europe and the US, Karnivool returned to Australia and announced the national 'New Day Tour'. Two Melbourne shows and a Sydney show quickly sold out, unprecedented in Karnivool's history, and further shows in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth were consequently announced. The band then temporarily ceased touring so that Kenny could tour with his other band Birds of Tokyo;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/24293/FasterLouder-presents-Birds-Of-Tokyo-and-Silversun-Pickups-tour |title=FasterLouder presents Birds of Tokyo and Silversun Pickups tour |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |access-date=6 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006070955/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/24293/FasterLouder-presents-Birds-Of-Tokyo-and-Silversun-Pickups-tour |archive-date=6 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> however, touring resumed by December 2010.<ref name="karnivool.com.au">{{cite web|url=http://www.karnivool.com.au/ |title=Karnivool |publisher=Karnivool |access-date=6 October 2012}}</ref>

On the back of Internet-based popularity, the band played its first ever show in India in 2010. The performance in [[Mumbai]] attracted 10,000 people and, as of July 2013, is the band's biggest show, with "fireworks and confetti cannons going off, and big movie screens on either side of the stage in this big amphitheatre and people singing along." Goddard explained the Indian experience, a result of [[file sharing]] and word-of-mouth, in a July 2013 interview:

<blockquote>
That was incredible. We've played a lot of Western countries but to go to a place like India, you know, all we thought we had in common was cricket but I was very wrong. That was our first show there. We didn't even have a release or anything. We didn't even realise we had a following there, then we announced the show and all these messages started coming back through social media ... Having a beer in the hotel room afterwards, we were like "What the hell? Did that actually happen?"<ref name="West" /></blockquote>

In March 2011, Karnivool announced three shows in their native Western Australia, commenting: "These shows will be the last of the Sound Awake era, as well as a possible pointer of things to come."<ref name="karnivool.com.au"/> At these shows they debuted a new song "The Refusal" and Goddard stated that the band was working in the studio on their third album.<ref>{{cite web|author=ashryn |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/reviews/events/28181/Karnivool-Metro-City-Perth-150411 |title=Karnivool @ Metro City, Perth (15/04/11) |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=17 April 2011 |access-date=6 October 2012}}</ref> The tour continued throughout the rest of Australia, and later in the year the band toured India for the [[IIT Bombay]] cultural festival [[Mood Indigo (festival)|Mood Indigo]] in December 2011.<ref>{{cite news|title=Karnivool brings down the house|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Karnivool-brings-down-the-house/Article1-784227.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313022750/http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Mumbai/Karnivool-brings-down-the-house/Article1-784227.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=13 March 2014|access-date=20 May 2013|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=19 December 2011|author=Bhavya Dore}}</ref>

Speaking with Simon Collins of ''The West Australian'' newspaper, Goddard explained that the recording process is difficult for the band and despite efforts to try and shorten the duration between albums, the band has managed to release three albums in fifteen years:

<blockquote>
It's something we grapple with all the time. We try to speed it up and make the frequency of album releases a lot faster. We're completely mystified by the songwriting process, and that's the bottom line for us - we don't know what we're doing. We don't.

Following the receipt of an ARIA award for ''Asymmetry'' (the first time the band has won an ARIA award), Goddard stated in a January 2014 interview that "it’s [the ARIA award] just one of those things where it’s almost like it validates us in other people’s eyes." Goddard further explained that the album was created as a reaction to his perception of a current musical trend, whereby "even heavy progressive music to me is losing a lot of the human characteristics, gridlocking everything and cutting out all the air between the guitar, the strums, and all that". Goddard announced that the band would undertake a national Australian tour with Dead Letter Circus and sleepmakeswaves during January 2014. He and Mark Hosking appear in the 2014 [[documentary]] film ''[[Metal Down Under]]''.
