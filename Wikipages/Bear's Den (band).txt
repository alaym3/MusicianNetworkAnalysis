===  2019–2020: ''So that you might hear me'' ===
In January 2019, the band changed their social media design after almost three years and a website was sent to people affiliated to their official page, called "So that you might hear me", the potential title for a new album. Four days later, it was revealed that their third album, titled indeed "So that you might hear me", would be released on 26 April 2019.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} They also released two singles the next day; "Blankets Of Sorrow" and "Fuel On The Fire". On 4 March they released the third single from the new album, "Laurel Wreath".{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} On 12 February 2019, A podcast carrying album's name was announced. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://bearsden.libsyn.com/|title=Bear's Den: So that you might hear me - The Podcast|first=Danny|last=Carissimi|date=12 February 2019|publisher=Libsyn}}</ref>Hosted by Danny Carissimi, it explores a different song on the new album in each episode through interviews with Davie and Jones.  In August 2019 the band headed off on a Highlands and Islands tour of Scotland taking in the likes of Stornaway, Aviemore, Banchory and Dunkeld. The tour was a stripped back acoustic affair and the band were joined on stage by Christof van der ven (who also supported) and Marcus Hamblett.

===  2020–present: ''Fragments'' ===
On 26 June 2020, the band posted a snippet of the ''Fragments'' version of "Fuel on the Fire", and changed their social media design. Over the next two days, the ''Fragments'' versions of "Napoleon" and "When You Break" were teased respectively. 

On 1 July 2020, the band announced a studio recording of the ''Fragments'' shows they had done with Paul Frith back in 2018. The hope was that Paul’s re-imaginings, his orchestral re-interpretations, would shed new light on some of the band's songs and in turn cause different reactions in the music and stir different emotions in the listener.
