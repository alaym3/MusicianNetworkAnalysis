==History==

===1996–1999: Formation and first years===
[[Chris Martin]] and [[Jonny Buckland]] first met during their [[orientation week]] at [[University College London]] (UCL) in September 1996.<ref>{{cite web|title=Front Row King|url=http://frontrowking.com/coldplay-tickets/index.html|publisher=frontrowking.com|access-date=13 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140514030523/http://frontrowking.com/coldplay-tickets/index.html|archive-date=14 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> The pair spent the rest of the university year planning a band, ultimately forming a group called Pectoralz.<ref name="all">{{cite web|access-date=1 May 2008|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/051126/yworld6.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601192601/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/yworld/archive/051126/yworld6.htm|archive-date=1 June 2008|title=All That Is Cold play |work=[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]|date=26 November 2005|author=Ali, Mehreen F. }}</ref> [[Guy Berryman]], a classmate of Martin and Buckland, later joined the group. By 1997, the group, who had renamed themselves Starfish, performed gigs for local [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] promoters at small clubs.<ref name="roach 19"/> Martin also had recruited his longtime school friend [[Phil Harvey (manager)|Phil Harvey]], who was studying [[classics]] at the [[University of Oxford]], to be the band's manager.<ref>{{harv|Roach|2003|p=22}}</ref> Coldplay have since accepted Harvey as the fifth member of the group.<ref name="id=80"/> The band's line-up was completed when [[Will Champion]] joined to take up percussion duties. Champion had grown up playing piano, guitar, bass, and [[tin whistle]]; he quickly learned the drums (despite having no previous experience).<ref name="all"/> Initially, the band rehearsed in Jonny Buckland's bedroom in a flat, with neighbours who were able to tolerate the noise.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VjaU1X_7-XQ&list=PLTuZdVO5lp6RmHS2DB15Ba4w0KSzfEbYG&index=4 |title=Coldplay - Behind the Scenes with the Band |website=youtube.com |access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> The band finally settled on the name "Coldplay", which was suggested by Tim Crompton, a local student who had been using the name for his group.<ref name="id=80"/>

By 1997, Martin had met Classics student [[Tim Rice-Oxley]]. During a weekend in the English village [[Virginia Water]] in Surrey they asked each other to play their own songs on the piano. Martin, finding Rice-Oxley to be talented, asked him to be Coldplay's keyboard player, but Rice-Oxley refused, as his own band, [[Keane (band)|Keane]], was already active. Days after, this event would shape the second line-up of Keane and keep Coldplay's unaltered, thus leaving both bands as quartets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Odell|first=Michael|url=http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |title=The Shore Thing (Annotated)|work=[[Q magazine]]|date=1 May 2004|pages=48–52|access-date=12 March 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061013211302/http://keane.at/articles/041.htm |archive-date = 13 October 2006}}</ref> In 1998, the band released 500 copies of the EP ''[[Safety (EP)|Safety]].''<ref name="balance" /> Most of the discs were given to record labels and friends; only 50 copies remained for sale to the public.

After completing their final examinations, Coldplay signed a five-album contract with [[Parlophone]] in early 1999.<ref name="parlophone"/> After making their first appearance at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], the band went into the studio to record a second EP, titled ''[[The Blue Room (EP)|The Blue Room]]''.<ref>{{harv|Roach|2003|p=26}}</ref> Five thousand copies were made available to the public in October,<ref name="roach 28">{{harv|Roach|2003|p=28}}</ref> and the single "Bigger Stronger" received [[BBC Radio 1]] airplay. The recording sessions for ''The Blue Room'' were tumultuous. Champion was briefly fired from the band, but Martin later pleaded with him to return after kicking him out, and because of his guilt, went on a drinking binge. Eventually, the band worked out their differences and put in place a new set of rules to keep the group intact. Inspired by bands like [[U2]] and [[R.E.M.]], Coldplay decided that they would operate as a democracy. Additionally, the band determined they would fire anyone who used [[Hard and soft drugs|hard drugs]].<ref name="The Edge">{{cite podcast|url=http://www.edge.ca |title=The Ongoing History of New Music&nbsp;– Coldplay |website=[[CFNY-FM|102.1 The Edge]] |publisher=[[Corus Entertainment]] |host=[[Alan Cross]] |year=2003 |access-date=23 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505080609/http://www.edge.ca/ |archive-date=5 May 2009 }}</ref>

[[File:AROBTTHTour1.jpg|thumb|Coldplay's live performances during their 2002 tour were noted for their use of [[strobe light]]ing]]
After the success of ''Parachutes'', Coldplay returned to the studio in September 2001 to begin work on their second album, ''[[A Rush of Blood to the Head]]'', once again with Ken Nelson producing. Since the band had never stayed in London before, they had trouble focusing. They decided to relocate in Liverpool, where they recorded some of the songs on ''Parachutes''. Once there, vocalist Chris Martin said that they became obsessed with recording. "[[In My Place]]" was the first song recorded for the album. The band released it as the album's lead single because it was the track that made them want to record a second album, following a "strange period of not really knowing what we were doing" three months after the success of ''Parachutes''. According to Martin "one thing kept us going: recording 'In My Place'. Then other songs started coming."<ref>Cumberbatch, Franklin (13 August 2002).

Much of the band's music has been described as "melancholic". Chris Martin is well-known for his unique voice, his expressive vocal style, and his extensive use of [[falsetto]] [which has both impressed and angered/annoyed critics. I suggest adding at least one positive and at least one negative source here]. The band's lyrics are often very vague and abstract [Chris once mentioned he likes to leave them up for the listener's interpretation, it would be nice to add this if a source is located]. Common themes throughout their lyrics include love and relationships between people (both platonic and romantic), loss, the "troubles" of life, [[existentialism]], and peace over conflict. Chris Martin said in 2008 that he "never" prints lyric sheets because "it would be like giving away the recipe for [[Jaffa Cakes]]". He also said, "I don't print the lyrics, partly because I'm embarrassed by them sometimes and secondly, because there's no need to [...] because you can listen to them.

''Mylo Xyloto'' also expanded the spectrum of Coldplay's sound by including much more prominent electronic elements, featuring mostly upbeat tones for the first time, and by predominantly being a [[pop rock]] album, in stark contrast to the band's previous works. Hermes wrote that "the music has a surprising tension" and that the record "mixes ginormous pop spectacle with Coldplay's knack for melody and Eno's knack for sonic nuance — qualities you rarely hear in the same package." He also said that Coldplay "wants to appeal to everybody" and that "''Mylo Xyloto'' doesn't revolve around Coldplay's usual midtempo, earworm piano ballads. Instead, it has the front-to-back musical arc of an old-fashioned LP, and its throw-everything-against-the-wall approach makes it more fun than any of the group's previous records. It may not win over all those haters, but that shouldn't stop it from selling a gazillion copies". The album's style also had some "more modern, urban and dance influences",<ref name="auto4"/> which would remain in most of Coldplay's subsequent works; bassist [[Guy Berryman]] said that the band approached the album with "a lot of confidence". Lyrical inspiration came from American [[graffiti]] and the German resistance group [[White Rose]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1673060/coldplay-mylo-xyloto-schizophrenic.jhtml |title=Coldplay Call Mylo Xyloto A 'Schizophrenic Album' – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV.com |date=24 October 2011 |access-date=12 July 2012}}</ref> Initially, the album was intended to have an acoustic style, but after writing "Paradise", the band "knew the acoustic thing didn't have legs".

The band's seventh album, ''[[A Head Full of Dreams]]'' mostly followed a pop style, with bright, uplifting tones and a lavish production (handled by [[Stargate (record producers)|Stargate]]), in stark contrast with its predecessor's minimalism. It also features elements of [[disco]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coldplay-are-back-with-a-sparky-disco-influenced-new-single-track-review|title=Coldplay Are Back With A Sparky, Disco-influenced New Single - Track Review &#124; NME.COM|date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004528/http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coldplay-are-back-with-a-sparky-disco-influenced-new-single-track-review|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> and [[funk]], particularly in its lead single "[[Adventure of a Lifetime]]".

The album's companion piece, ''[[Kaleidoscope EP]],'' followed a similar trend, in spite of being more diverse and encompassing different styles.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Review: Coldplay Continue Mood of Tranquil Satisfaction on Latest EP|work=Rolling Stone|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/review-coldplays-kaleidoscope-ep-w494247|access-date=2017-08-18}}</ref> Brian Eno, [[Big Sean]] and [[the Chainsmokers]] all contributed to the tracks.

In the band's eighth album, ''[[Everyday Life (Coldplay album)|Everyday Life]]'', their music saw somewhat of a return to the experimentation and organic sound of ''Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends'', but with some of the pop influences carried over from their previous three albums, as well as new influences from [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[blues]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/music/coldplay/coldplay-everyday-life-review/|title=Coldplay's Everyday Life is a Surprising Return to Form|date=26 November 2019|website=pastemagazine.com}}</ref> It is also similar to ''Viva la Vida'' with themes about the consequences of war and conflict, though the political messages of the album are much more explicit and specific. The song "Guns" is a critique of [[small arms trade|guns-proliferation]] and is one of the few tracks by the band to feature [[profanity]]. Chris Martin explained the meaning of the song "Orphans" as it pertains to real life during a rehearsal with [[Saturday Night Live|SNL]] dancers, saying, "This song is about, you see all these pictures of young people like you and a bit older people like us, having to leave their countries and everyone calls them refugees or migrants rather than just people. So we were thinking about, this could be any of us who is in these camps or at the border or whatever. And that's what this song’s about, it's like people like us saying, 'I just want to go home and be normal'".<ref>{{cite tweet|url=https://twitter.com/coldplay/status/1191788923535663105 |title=Chris explains what Orphans is about at last week's rehearsals with the band's SNL dancers. |number=1191788923535663105 |user=coldplay |date=5 November 2019 |access-date=2021-05-11}}</ref>

Regarding the band's wide international success, Parlophone's president [[Miles Leonard]] has stated that one of Coldplay's "secrets" is that they have never sounded like a parochial UK artist, saying: "Some bands are very proud to be British, but sometimes come across as being very "British". Coldplay never aspire to that; on one hand they sound British but on the other they sound like a huge global artist."<ref name="hitquarters.com"/> In 2011, Coldplay were hailed as "rock statesmen".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/itunesfestival2011/artists/coldplay/ |title=Coldplay at iTunes Festival |publisher=Itv.com |access-date=8 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707083159/https://www.itv.com/itunesfestival2011/artists/coldplay/ |archive-date=7 July 2011 }}</ref>
