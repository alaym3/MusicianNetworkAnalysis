Two weeks later, on June 26, when the video received different criticism in China and other Asian countries, RiceGum released a video, saying that he was just "joking around".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://shanghai.ist/2018/06/youtuber-ricegum-asks-locals-where-he-can-eat-dog-meat-in-offensive-hong-kong-travelogue/|title=YouTuber RiceGum asks locals where he can eat dog meat in offensive Hong Kong travelogue – shanghaiist|website=shanghai.ist|access-date=June 28, 2018}}</ref> He defended himself saying that he was just trying to use Asian stereotypes to point to American comedy culture and that people are being too sensitive.

=== Mystery box website promotion ===
In January 2019, RiceGum, along with Jake Paul, came under fire for promoting ''MysteryBrand'', a website which offers the chance to open a digital "mystery box" of pre-selected items with a promise to win one in real life at random. Many users have said they have not received prizes they won through the site, and concluded the site is a scam.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thisisinsider.com/mysterybrand-mystery-box-jake-paul-critics-scam-2019-1|title=Jake Paul and other influencers are promoting 'mystery boxes' to their young audiences. Critics say it's a scam.|last=Shamsian|first=Jacob|work=Insider|date=January 3, 2019|access-date=January 3, 2019}}</ref> In response, RiceGum made a video in which he pointed out that other YouTubers made their own videos promoting ''MysteryBrand'' months prior, saying "No-one said anything, it wasn't a problem back then. Why did no-one bring it up, or even talk about these guys? This mystery box thing has been on the internet for 3 or 4 months even from other creators, but as soon as I do it, it's a problem?" At the end of the video, he decided to give away [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] gift card codes, saying "There's nothing I can really do but say sorry and give you these Amazon gift cards". However, many people called him out for the Amazon codes already being expired.<ref>{{cite web|title=RiceGum called out for giving away a bunch of expired Amazon codes|url=https://www.dailydot.com/upstream/ricegum-amazon-codes/|publisher=The Daily Dot|date=January 9, 2019}}</ref>

=== Save The Kids Token ===
In June 2021, RiceGum along with members of [[FaZe Clan]] were influencer ambassadors for a crypto token called Save The Kids (KIDS) which was marketed as a charity token meant to give a percentage of the transaction fee to the [[Binance]] Charity Wallet.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Save the Kids|url=https://www.savethekids.io/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210610101211/https://www.savethekids.io/|archive-date=2021-06-10|access-date=2021-07-16|website=www.savethekids.io}}</ref> The token was then [[Pump and dump|pumped and dumped]] by many of the ambassadors and the token's value quickly crashed shortly after when it was released.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Faze Clan Members Skewered By Fans Following Huge Crypto Losses|url=https://kotaku.com/faze-clan-members-skewered-by-fans-following-huge-crypt-1847188685|access-date=2021-07-16|website=Kotaku|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Binder|first=Matt|date=2021-07-01|title=A look into a failed influencer deal to promote a cryptocurrency|url=https://mashable.com/article/banksocial-altcoin-influencer-deal-faze|access-date=2021-07-16|website=Mashable|language=en}}</ref>
