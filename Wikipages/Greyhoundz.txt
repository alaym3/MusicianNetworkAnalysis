'''Greyhoundz''' is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[nu metal]]/[[rap metal]] band formed in the late 1990s which gained international recognition and is currently based in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].

==Background==
Greyhoundz was formed in 1997 by cousins Niño and Audie Avenido who at first just wanted to join a local battle of the bands contest together with other bandmates that included Allen Cudal. The contest was canceled so they opted to audition at the now defunct [[Club DREDD]] that was based in [[Manila]].

They later recruited Reg Rubio, who was from another band that also played at Club Dredd and TJ Brillantes came on board shortly after.

On May 6, 2004, Allen Cudal died from a car accident. The 2004 Pulp SummerSlam was the last time the band performed with their complete line up.

Despite the tragic event and as a sign of respect for their late bandmate, the group now performs as a four-piece band instead of hiring a new member.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpYIVBU3oyE|title=WASAK EP 097 GREYHOUNDZ|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=16 November 2020}}</ref>
