He said, "I live in a small town and it was hard to branch out from it. I've played every birthday party, wedding, school disco, pub and club you can imagine." He built a loyal following by releasing mixes on Soundcloud. Rather than the usual genre-specific mixes being put out, he released mashup multi-genre mixes covering everything from house music to hip-hop, reggae, bassline and pop. Nathan was the first DJ without a radio show or hit single to sell out his own concert at the O2. He said, "It took me to the point where I was headlining massive festivals and performing sell out shows in huge clubs. I knew that wouldn't last forever, particularly with the rise of things like Spotify, so I set up a four-year plan and delved deeper into the production side of the industry."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/how-burton-born-dj-nathan-dawe-scored-a-top-40-smash-with-a-cover-of-flowers__29448/|title=How Burton-born DJ Nathan Dawe scored a Top 40 smash with Flowers|website=[[Official Charts Company]]|accessdate=15 April 2020|archive-date=15 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200415142221/https://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/how-burton-born-dj-nathan-dawe-scored-a-top-40-smash-with-a-cover-of-flowers__29448/|url-status=live}}</ref> He began remixing other producers in his early twenties.<ref name="AllMusic"/> His debut single, "Cheatin'", based on an uncredited sample of [[Deborah Cox]]'s "[[It's Over Now (Deborah Cox song)|It's Over Now]]", was released in August 2018 and peaked at number 94 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].
