If Furtado is a dual citizen of Canada and Portugal, please provide reliable sources which clearly state this. --> singer and songwriter.

She first gained fame with her [[trip hop]]-inspired debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'' (2000), which was a critical and commercial success that spawned two top-10 singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "[[I'm Like a Bird]]" and "[[Turn Off the Light]]". The first of the two singles won her a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Furtado's introspective folk-heavy 2003 second album, ''[[Folklore (Nelly Furtado album)|Folklore]]'', explored her Portuguese roots. Its singles received moderate success in Europe, but the album's underperformance compared to her debut was regarded as a [[sophomore slump]].

Furtado's third album, ''[[Loose (Nelly Furtado album)|Loose]]'' (2006), was a smash hit and became her bestselling album, with more than 12 million copies sold worldwide, also making it one of the bestselling albums of the 2000s.<ref name="canadianencyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/nelly-furtado|title=Nelly Furtado |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |year=2012 |access-date=November 7, 2014}}</ref> Considered a radical image reinvention, Furtado continued to explore her Portuguese heritage while leaning heavier into [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]. The album spawned four successful number-one singles worldwide; "[[Promiscuous (song)|Promiscuous]]", "[[Maneater (Nelly Furtado song)|Maneater]]", "[[Say It Right]]", and "[[All Good Things (Come to an End)]]". Her [[Timbaland]] collaboration "[[Give It to Me (Timbaland song)|Give It to Me]]" (2007) in the same era also topped the charts in the US and overseas. Furtado's critically acclaimed duet with [[James Morrison (singer)|James Morrison]], "[[Broken Strings (song)|Broken Strings]]", also topped the charts in Europe in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|author=Fraser McAlpine |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/chartblog/2008/12/james_morrison_ft_nelly_furtad.shtml |title=Chart Blog: James Morrison ft.

She released her first Spanish-language album, ''[[Mi Plan]]'', in 2009, which won her a [[Latin Grammy Award]] for [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Album|Best Female Pop Vocal Album]]. In 2012, Furtado released her nostalgia-inspired fifth album ''[[The Spirit Indestructible]]''. Furtado split with her management and went independent thereafter, releasing her indie-pop sixth album, ''[[The Ride (Nelly Furtado album)|The Ride]]'', in 2017 under her own label [[:pt:Nelstar|Nelstar Entertainment]].

Furtado has sold over 40 million records worldwide, making her one of the most successful Canadian artists. She has won several [[List of awards and nominations received by Nelly Furtado|awards]] throughout her career, including one [[Grammy Award]] from seven nominations, one [[Latin Grammy Award]], ten [[Juno Awards]], one [[BRIT Award]], one [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Award]], one [[MTV Europe Music Award]], one [[World Music Award]], and three [[Much Music Video Awards]].

== Career ==
=== 1996–1999: Career beginnings ===
During a visit with her sister Lisa Anne in [[Toronto]] in mid-1995, Furtado met Tallis Newkirk, member of the [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group Plains of Fascination. She contributed vocals to their 1996 album, ''Join the Ranks'', on the track "Waitin' 4 the Streets".<ref name="nelstar">{{cite web|url=http://www.nelstar-project.com/about/nelstar|title=Nelstar* (Nelly Furtado) Biography|work=Nelstar-Project.com|access-date=December 9, 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060101212435/http://www.nelstar-project.com/about/nelstar/|archive-date=January 1, 2006}}</ref> After graduating from [[Mount Douglas Secondary School]] in 1996, she moved to Toronto to reside with her sister Lisa Anne. The following year, she formed Nelstar, a [[trip hop]] duo with Newkirk. Ultimately, Furtado felt the trip hop style of the duo was "too segregated", and believed it did not represent her personality or allow her to showcase her vocal ability.<ref name="nelstar" /> She left the group and planned to move back home.

In 1997, she performed at the Honey Jam talent show.<ref name="nelstar" /><ref name="honeyjam">{{cite web | url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/33869/honey-jam-searches-for-urban-women | title=Honey Jam Searches for Urban Women | work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | date=May 27, 2003 | access-date=September 16, 2009 | first=Stephanie | last=Forrest | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330041829/http://www.chartattack.com/news/33869/honey-jam-searches-for-urban-women | archive-date=March 30, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Her performance attracted the attention of [[The Philosopher Kings]] singer [[Gerald Eaton]], who then approached her to write with him. He and fellow Kings member [[Brian West (musician)|Brian West]] helped Furtado produce a demo. She left Toronto, but returned again to record more material with Eaton and West. The material recorded during these sessions was shopped to record companies by her attorney [[Chris Taylor (Music Attorney)|Chris Taylor]] and led to her 1999 record deal with [[DreamWorks Records]], signed by A&R executive Beth Halper, partner of [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] drummer and record producer [[Butch Vig]].<ref name="mm">{{cite web|url=http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|title=Nelly Furtado Biography|work=MapleMusic|access-date=May 27, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123100037/http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|archive-date=November 23, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Furtado's first single, "[[Party's Just Begun (Again)]]", was released that year on the [[Brokedown Palace: Music from the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack|soundtrack album]] for ''[[Brokedown Palace]]'' (1999).

=== 2000–2005: ''Whoa, Nelly!'' and ''Folklore'' ===
Furtado continued the collaboration with Eaton and West, who co-produced her debut album, ''[[Whoa, Nelly!]]'', which was released in October 2000. The album was an international success, supported by three international singles: "[[I'm Like a Bird]]", "[[Turn Off the Light]]", and "[[...On the Radio (Remember the Days)]]". It received four Grammy nominations in 2002, and her debut single won for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]]. Furtado's work was also critically acclaimed for her innovative mixture of various genres and sounds. ''[[Slant Magazine]]'' called the album "a delightful and refreshing antidote to the army of 'pop princesses' and rap-metal bands that had taken over popular music at the turn of the millennium".<ref name="slant74">{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=74|title=Whoa, Nelly!|work=Slant|access-date=May 28, 2006|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060822200404/http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/music_review.asp?ID=74|archive-date=August 22, 2006}}</ref> The sound of the album was strongly influenced by musicians who had traversed cultures and "the challenge of making heartfelt, emotional music that's upbeat and hopeful".<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|title= Nelly FurtadoBio|work= MapleMusic|access-date= May 27, 2006|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111123100037/http://www.maplemusic.com/artists/nfu/bio.asp|archive-date= November 23, 2011|url-status= dead}}</ref> According to ''Maclean's'' magazine, ''Whoa, Nelly!'' had sold six million copies worldwide as of August 2006.<ref>Intini, John.

Furtado's second album, ''[[Folklore (Nelly Furtado album)|Folklore]]'', was released in November 2003. One of the tracks on the album, "Childhood Dreams", was dedicated to her daughter, Nevis. The album includes the single "[[Força]]", the official anthem of the [[UEFA Euro 2004]].

"Powerless (Say What You Want)" was later remixed into a Spanish version called "Abre Tu Corazón", featuring Juanes, who had previously worked with Furtado on his track "Fotografía".
