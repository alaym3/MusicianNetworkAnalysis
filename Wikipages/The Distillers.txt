'''The Distillers''' are an American [[punk rock]] band, formed in Los Angeles, California in 1998 by vocalist and guitarist [[Brody Dalle]]. Dalle co-wrote, played guitar and provided lead vocals for nearly every track on the band's three albums. After the breakup of the band in 2006, Dalle and Distillers guitarist [[Tony Bevilacqua]] went on to form [[Spinnerette]].

==History==
The Distillers first came together in late 1998, when Australian-born guitarist [[Brody Dalle]] met bassist Kim Chi and the two bonded over their love for playing punk rock. They proceeded to recruit Detroit guitarist Rose Mazzola and drummer Matt Young.

Signed to [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]], the band issued its [[The Distillers (album)|self-titled]] debut in April 2000. By the end of the year, Kim Chi had left the group to join [[Exene Cervenka]] in her band, the Original Sinners. For awhile [[The Nerve Agents]] bassist Dante Sigona was playing bass for the distillers but  [[Ryan Sinn]] stepped in and took position. Matt departed to join Chi while Mazzola left during the height of "Seneca Falls". By summer 2002, The Distillers were composed of Dalle, Sinn, and new drummer [[Andy Granelli]]; joint American dates with [[No Doubt]] and [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] were planned for later that fall. Guitarist/vocalist [[Tony Bevilacqua|Tony Bradley]] joined The Distillers in time for the recording of their third album and major-label debut, ''[[Coral Fang]]'', which was released in 2003 by [[Sire Records|Sire]]. Following her very public divorce from [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]'s [[Tim Armstrong]] that same year, [[Brody Dalle]] resumed performing under her own name.

Granelli left the band in early 2005, moving on to play with Darker My Love, and by summer, Sinn had exited as well, later joining up with [[Angels & Airwaves]]. Despite rumors, The Distillers, now just Dalle and Bradley, denied that they were breaking up, instead simply going on hiatus. In early 2006, Dalle had her first child, daughter Camille, with new husband [[Josh Homme]] of [[Queens of the Stone Age]]. By the year's end, the two remaining members formally announced the band's disbandment and went on to form [[Spinnerette]] together.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-distillers-mn0000149102/biography |title=Artist Biography |last=Wilson |first=MacKenzie |publisher=[[Allmusic]] |access-date=2013-07-29 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503093817/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-distillers-mn0000149102/biography |archive-date=2014-05-03 }}</ref>

In January 2018, Dalle shared a teaser video from The Distillers' Instagram and a newly-opened Twitter account to confirm the return of the band. Initially, it was believed the four Twitter accounts that The Distillers' Twitter was following, would make up the 2018 line-up of the band: Dalle, Bradley, Granelli and former Spinnerette member Alain Johannes. Since then, however, the account has removed Johannes; and subsequently added former bassist Sinn. Bradley has since deleted his Twitter account.

It was later announced that the band would perform their first official show in over 13 years at [[The Casbah (music venue)|The Casbah]] in [[San Diego, California]] in late April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Fu|first1=Eddie C.|title=The Distillers reveal reunion tour dates|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/01/the-distillers-reveal-reunion-tour-dates/|website=Access Atlanta|publisher=AJC.com|access-date=23 April 2018}}</ref>

On September 11, 2018, the Distillers official Instagram account announced the release of a new single available on iTunes.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE DISTILLERS MAN VERSUS MAGNET/BLOOD IN GUTTERS|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BnnDusrDnjN/|website=Instagram|access-date=2018-09-11}}</ref> In April 2019 the band confirmed that they'd begin recording their fourth album and follow-up to ''[[Coral Fang]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEWS: The Distillers to start recording its fourth album in April 2019! |url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-the-distillers-to-start-recording-fourth-album-in-april-2019 |website=DEAD PRESS! |access-date=2018-01-04}}</ref>

On April 28, 2019, The Distillers announced they would be entering the studio with English music producer Nick Launay who has worked with Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Arcade Fire, Kate Bush, Talking Heads, David Byrne, INXS and many more.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rawmusictv.com/article/amp/2019/The-Distillers-are-entering-the-studio-to-record-first-album-in-16-years | title = The Distillers are entering the studio to record first album in 16 years | date = April 29, 2019 | access-date = April 29, 2019 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>
