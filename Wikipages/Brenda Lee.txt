'''Brenda Mae Tarpley''' (born December 11, 1944), known professionally as '''Brenda Lee''', is an American singer. Performing [[rockabilly]], [[pop music|pop]] and [[country music]], she had 47 US chart hits during the 1960s and is ranked fourth in that decade, surpassed only by [[Elvis Presley]], [[the Beatles]] and [[Ray Charles]].<ref name=Rockabilly>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/BrendaLee1.html|title=Brenda Lee: The Lady, The Legend|website=Rockabillyhall.com|publisher=[[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref> She is known for her 1960 hit "[[I'm Sorry (Brenda Lee song)|I'm Sorry]]", and 1958's "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]", which has become a Christmas standard.<ref name=IMDB>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0496909/bio|title=Brenda Lee: Biography|website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 10, 2019}}</ref>

At 4&nbsp;ft 9&nbsp;inches tall (approximately 145&nbsp;cm), she received the nickname "Little Miss Dynamite" in 1957, after recording the song "Dynamite" when she was 12, and was one of the earliest pop stars to have a major contemporary international following.<ref name=RollingStone>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inside-the-life-of-brenda-lee-the-pop-heroine-next-door-205175/|title=Inside the Life of Brenda Lee, the Pop Heroine Next Door|last=Bernstein|first=Jonathan|date=February 20, 2018|website=Rollingstone.com|publisher=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref>

In 1969, Lee returned to the charts with her recording "Johnny One Time" penned by A.L. "Doodle" Owens and Dallas Frazier. The song reached #3 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] Chart and #41 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The song also earned Lee her second Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Pop Female Vocal]]. Later success came with a return to her roots as a country singer, with a string of hits through the 1970s and 1980s. She is a member of the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll]], [[Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum|Country Music]] and [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame|Rockabilly]] Halls of Fame.

== Early life and education ==
Brenda Lee was born Brenda Mae Tarpley on December 11, 1944, in the charity ward of [[Grady Memorial Hospital]] in [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/brenda-lee-b-1944 |title=Brenda Lee (b. 1944) &#124; New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |access-date=August 17, 2015}}</ref> to parents Annie Grace (née Yarbrough) and Reuben Lindsey Tarpley. She weighed 4 pounds 11 ounces at birth. Lee attended grade schools wherever her father found work, primarily between Atlanta and [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]. Her family was poor. As a child, she shared a bed with her brother and sister in a series of three-room houses without running water. Life centered on her parents finding work, their family, and the [[Baptists|Baptist church]], where she began singing solos every Sunday.<ref name=IMDB_TV>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456820/|title=Brenda Lee: Little Miss Dynamite |website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 11, 2019}}</ref><ref name=Dynamite>{{cite book|last=Lee|first=Brenda|first2=Robert K.|last2=Oermann|first3=Julie|last3=Clay|title=Little Miss Dynamite: the life and times of Brenda Lee|publisher=Hyperion|date=2002|pages=[https://archive.org/details/littlemissdynami00bren/page/305 305]|url=https://archive.org/details/littlemissdynami00bren|url-access=registration|isbn=9780786866441}}</ref>

Lee's father was a farmer's son in Georgia's red-clay belt.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} Standing 5&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;inches (170&nbsp;cm), he was an excellent left-handed pitcher and spent 11 years in the [[United States Army]] playing baseball. Her mother came from a [[working class]] family in [[Greene County, Georgia|Greene County]], Georgia.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Though her family did not have indoor plumbing until after her father's death, they had a battery-powered table radio that fascinated Brenda as a baby.<ref name=Dynamite /> Both her mother and sister remembered taking her repeatedly to a local candy store before she turned three. One of them would stand her on the counter and she would earn candy or coins for singing.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

== Career ==
===Child performer===
{{Unreferenced section|date= January 2020}}
Lee's voice, face and stage presence won her wider attention from the time she was five years old. At age six, she won a local singing contest sponsored by local elementary schools. The reward was a live appearance on an Atlanta radio show, ''Starmakers Revue'', where she performed for the next year.

Her father died in 1953 in a construction accident, and by the time she turned ten she was the primary breadwinner of her family, through singing at events and on local radio and television shows. During that time, she appeared regularly on the country music show "TV Ranch" on [[WAGA-TV]] in Atlanta; she was so short, the host would lower a stand microphone as low as it would go and stand her up on a wooden crate to reach it. In 1955, Grayce Tarpley was remarried to Buell "Jay" Rainwater, who moved the family to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], Ohio, where he worked at the [[Jimmie Skinner]] Music Center. Lee performed with Skinner at the record shop on two Saturday programs broadcast over Newport, Kentucky, radio station [[WNOP (AM)|WNOP]]. The family soon returned to Georgia, but this time to [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], and Lee appeared on the show ''The Peach Blossom Special'' on [[WJAT|WJAT-AM]] in [[Swainsboro, Georgia|Swainsboro]].

===National exposure and stardom===
[[File:Brenda-Lee and Peter Denton.jpg|thumb|left|Brenda Lee at the Granada, [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], April 1962]]
Lee's breakthrough came in February 1955, when she turned down $30 ($304 in 2021 value) to appear on a Swainsboro radio station to see [[Red Foley]] and a touring promotional unit of his ABC-TV program ''[[Ozark Jubilee]]'' in Augusta. An Augusta [[disc jockey]] persuaded Foley to hear her sing before the show. Foley did and agreed to let her perform "[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]" on stage that night, unrehearsed. Foley later recounted the moments following her introduction:

{{Pull quote|I still get cold chills thinking about the first time I heard that voice. One foot started patting rhythm as though she was stomping out a prairie fire but not another muscle in that little body even as much as twitched. And when she did that trick of breaking her voice, it jarred me out of my trance enough to realize I'd forgotten to get off the stage. There I stood, after 26 years of supposedly learning how to conduct myself in front of an audience, with my mouth open two miles wide and a glassy stare in my eyes.{{Cite quote| date= January 2020}}}} 

On March 31, 1955, the 10-year-old made her network debut on ''Ozark Jubilee'' in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. Although her five-year contract with the show was broken by a 1957 lawsuit brought by her mother and her manager,<ref>{{citation|first1=Brenda|last1=Lee|first2=Robert K.|last2=Oermann|first3=Julie|last3=Clay|title=Little Miss Dynamite: the Life and Times of Brenda Lee|publisher=Hyperion|year=2002|isbn=0-7868-8558-0|url=https://archive.org/details/littlemissdynami00bren}}</ref> she nevertheless made regular appearances on the program throughout its run.

Less than two months later, on July 30, 1956, [[Decca Records]] offered her a contract, and her first record was "Jambalaya", backed with "Bigelow 6-200". Lee's second single featured two novelty Christmas tunes: "I'm Gonna Lasso Santa Claus", and "Christy Christmas". Though she turned 12 on December 11, 1956, both of the first two Decca singles credit her as "Little Brenda Lee (9 Years Old)."{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Neither of the 1956 releases charted, but her first issue in 1957, "[[One Step at a Time (Brenda Lee song)|One Step at a Time]]", written by Hugh Ashley, became a hit in both the pop and country fields. Her next hit, "Dynamite", coming out of a 4-foot 9-inch frame, led to her lifelong nickname, Little Miss Dynamite.<ref name=Dynamite />

Lee first attracted attention performing in country music venues and shows; however, her label and management felt it best to market her exclusively as a pop artist, the result being that none of her best-known recordings from the 1960s were released to country radio, and despite her country sound, with top Nashville session people, she did not have another country hit until 1969 with "[[Johnny One Time]]".{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

===Biggest hits: 1958–1966===
[[File:Brenda Lee.png|thumb|right|Brenda Lee in 1965]]
Lee achieved her biggest success on the [[Record chart|pop charts]] in the late 1950s through the mid-1960s with [[rockabilly]] and [[rock and roll]]-styled songs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brendalee.com/pages/biography.html |title=Brenda Lee: the Lady, the Legend|publisher=Brenda Lee Productions|access-date=April 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414094639/http://www.brendalee.com/pages/biography.html |archive-date=April 14, 2009}}</ref> Her biggest hits included "Jambalaya", "[[Sweet Nothin's]]" (No. 4, written by country musician [[Ronnie Self]]), "I Want to Be Wanted" (No. 1), "[[All Alone Am I]]" (No. 3) and "[[Fool No. 1|Fool #1]]" (No. 3). She had more hits with the more pop-based songs "[[That's All You Gotta Do]]" (No. 6), "[[Emotions (Brenda Lee song)|Emotions]]" (No. 7), "[[You Can Depend on Me (song)|You Can Depend on Me]]" (No. 6), "[[Dum Dum (Brenda Lee song)|Dum Dum]]" (No. 4), 1962's "[[Break It to Me Gently]]" (No. 2), "[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]" (No. 6), and "[[As Usual]]" (No. 12). Lee's total of nine consecutive top 10 Billboard Hot 100 hits from "That's All You Gotta Do" in 1960 through "All Alone Am I" in 1962 set a record for a female solo artist that was not equaled until 1986 by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

The biggest-selling track of Lee's career was a [[Christmas]] song. In 1958, when she was 13, producer [[Owen Bradley]] asked her to record a new song by [[Johnny Marks]], who had had success writing Christmas tunes for country singers, most notably "[[Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer (song)|Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer]]" ([[Gene Autry]]) and "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]" ([[Burl Ives]]). Lee recorded the song, "[[Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree]]", in July with a prominent twanging guitar part by [[Hank Garland]] and raucous sax soloing by Nashville icon [[Boots Randolph]]. Decca released it as a single that November, but it sold only 5,000 copies, and did not do much better when it was released again in 1959. However, over subsequent years, it eventually sold more than five million copies.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/103 103]|isbn=0-214-20512-6|url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/103}}</ref>

In 1960, she recorded her [[signature song]], "[[I'm Sorry (Brenda Lee song)|I'm Sorry]]", which hit No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' pop chart.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} It was her first gold single and was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} Even though it was not released as a country song, it was among the first big hits to use what was to become the [[Nashville sound]]&nbsp;— a string orchestra and [[legato]] harmonized background vocals. "Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree" was finally noticed in its third release a few months later, and sales snowballed; the song remains a perennial favorite each December and is the record with which she is most identified by contemporary audiences.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Her last top ten single on the pop charts in the United States was 1963's "[[Losing You (Brenda Lee song)|Losing You]]" (No. 6), though she continued to have other chart hits such as 1964's "[[As Usual]]" (which peaked at No. 12 in the US and made No. 5 in the UK), her 1966 song "[[Coming on Strong (song)|Coming on Strong]]" (which peaked at No.11 in the US) and "[[Is It True (Brenda Lee song)|Is It True]]" (No.17 in both the US and the UK) in 1964.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} The latter, featuring [[Big Jim Sullivan]], [[Jimmy Page]] on guitars, [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]] on drums, was her only hit single recorded in [[London]], England, and was produced by [[Mickie Most]] (but the slide guitar and background singers were overdubbed in Nashville). It was recorded at Decca Records' number two studio at their West Hampstead complex, as was the UK B-side, a version of Ray Charles' 1959 classic cut, "[[What'd I Say]]?", which was not released in America.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}} The A-side "Is It True?" was composed by noted British songwriting team [[Ken Lewis (songwriter)|Ken Lewis]] and [[John Carter (musician)|John Carter]], who were also members of UK hitmakers the [[The Ivy League (band)|Ivy League]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

===International fame===
Lee was popular in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] from early in her career. She performed on television in the UK in 1959, before she had achieved much pop recognition in the United States. Her first hit single in the UK was "[[Sweet Nothin's]]", which reached No.4 on the UK singles chart in the spring of 1960. She subsequently had a UK hit (in 1961) with "[[Let's Jump the Broomstick]]", a rockabilly number recorded in 1959, which had not charted in the United States, but reached No.12 in the UK.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bernstein|first1=Jonathan|title=Inside the Life of Brenda Lee, the Pop Heroine Next Door|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/brenda-lee-nashville-more-than-rockin-around-the-christmas-tree-w516825|publisher=Rolling Stone|access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref>

Lee had two Top Ten hits in the UK that were not released as singles in her native country: the first, "[[Speak to Me Pretty]]" peaked at No.3 in May 1962 and was her greatest hit in the UK by chart placing, swiftly followed by "[[Here Comes That Feeling]]", which reached No.5 in the summer of 1962. The latter was issued as the B-side to "[[Everybody Loves Me But You]]" in the United States (which peaked at No.6 on the Billboard Hot 100); however, "Here Comes That Feeling" also made an appearance in the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No.89, despite its B-side status in the US.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

In 1962, while touring [[West Germany]], she appeared at the famous [[Star-Club]], [[Hamburg]], with the Beatles as the opening act.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bernstein |first1=Jonathan |title=Brenda Lee: Inside the Life of a Pop Heroine Next Door |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/inside-the-life-of-brenda-lee-the-pop-heroine-next-door-205175/ |website=Rolling Stone |access-date=1 April 2021 |date=20 February 2018}}</ref> Lee also had big hits in the UK with "[[All Alone Am I]]" (No.7 in 1963) and "[[As Usual]]" (No.5 in 1964).{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Brenda Lee first visited England for three days in April 1959 as a last-minute replacement on "[[Oh Boy! (TV series)|Oh Boy!]]". She first toured the UK in March and April 1962 with [[Gene Vincent]] and [[Sounds Incorporated]] (as her backing group), and she toured the country for a second time in March 1963, this time supported by [[the Bachelors]], [[Sounds Incorporated]], [[Tony Sheridan]], and [[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

Brenda Lee also toured in [[Ireland]] in 1963 and appeared on the front cover of the Irish dancing and entertainment magazine ''Spotlight'' in April that year.{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

After appearing at the annual [[Royal Variety Performance]] before [[Queen Elizabeth II]] at the [[London Palladium]] on November 2, 1964, Lee toured [[UK|Britain]] again in November and December 1964, supported by (amongst others) [[Manfred Mann]], [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates]], [[the John Barry Seven]], [[Wayne Fontana]] & [[the Mindbenders]], [[Marty Wilde]], [[the Tornados]] and [[Heinz (singer)|Heinz Burt]].{{Citation needed|date= January 2020}}

===Later career===
{{Unreferenced section|date= January 2020}}
During the early 1970s, Lee re-established herself as a country music artist, and earned a string of top ten hits in the United States on the country charts. The first was 1973's "[[Nobody Wins (Brenda Lee song)|Nobody Wins]]", which reached the top five that spring and became her last Top 100 pop hit, peaking at No. 70. The follow-up, the [[Mark James (songwriter)|Mark James]] composition "[[Sunday Sunrise (song)|Sunday Sunrise]]", reached No. 6 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard magazine]]'s'' Hot Country Singles chart that October. Other major hits included "[[Wrong Ideas]]" and "[[Big Four Poster Bed]]" (1974); and "[[Rock on Baby]]" and "[[She's My Rock|He's My Rock]]" (both 1975).

After a few years of lesser hits, Lee began another run at the top ten with 1979's "[[Tell Me What It's Like]]". Two follow-ups also reached the Top 10 in 1980: "[[The Cowgirl and the Dandy]]" and "[[Broken Trust]]" (the latter featuring vocal backing by [[the Oak Ridge Boys]]). A 1982 album, ''[[The Winning Hand]]'', featuring Lee along with [[Dolly Parton]], [[Kris Kristofferson]] and [[Willie Nelson]], was a surprise hit, reaching the top ten on the U.S. country albums chart. Her last well-known hit was 1984's "[[Hallelujah, I Love Her So]]" in duet with [[George Jones]] (Lee sang this song individually before and released in 1960 on ''[[This Is...Brenda]]'').

===Recent years===
Lee has continued to record and perform around the world, having previously cut records in four different languages. In 1992, she recorded a duet ("You’ll Never Know") with [[Willy DeVille]] on his album ''[[Loup Garou (album)|Loup Garou]]''.<ref name="digitaljournal.com">{{Cite news |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/entertainment/music/brenda-lee-announces-signing-with-webster-public-relations/article/490083 |title=Brenda Lee announces signing with Webster Public Relations|date=April 11, 2017|access-date=April 21, 2017}}</ref>
