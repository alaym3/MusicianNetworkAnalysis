On 17 September 2021, they released their sophomore album ''[[Tangaroa (album)|Tangaroa]]''.

==Musical style, influences, and lyrical themes==
Alien Weaponry's debut single, "Urutaa", is sung partly in the [[Māori language]] and was originally about a clash of ideas and expectations leading to stress and unhappiness, which was likened to a plague or ''urutaa'' (an outbreak). The Māori lyrics refer to events that occurred in the [[Bay of Islands]] in the 1800s and what followed after a pocket watch was inadvertently dropped into the harbour. The misunderstanding culminated in the [[Boyd massacre|burning of the Boyd]], a grim set of events in New Zealand's colonial history. The band says, "This incident is used in this song as a metaphor for the misunderstandings that continue to plague us today – between cultures, generations and individuals who torment each other through lack of understanding." {{Citation needed|reason= This appears to be a direct quote from the band - what is the written source of this quote? |date=June 2020}}

The band's second single "Raupatu" (released in February 2017) is about [[New Zealand land confiscations|land confiscations by the New Zealand colonial government]] in the 1800s and the legislation of 1863 that allowed it to happen. Their third single, "Rū Ana te Whenua" (the trembling earth), released 1 July 2017, refers to the mighty battle at Pukehinahina/[[Gate Pa]] in 1864 where the brothers' great great great grandfather, Te Ahoaho, lost his life.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2017/12/05/567304737/this-new-zealand-band-is-trying-to-save-maori-culture-one-head-banger-at-a-time |title=This New Zealand Band Is Trying To Save Maori Culture One Head Banger at a Time |date=5 December 2017 |access-date=6 December 2017 |publisher=NPR |first=Ashley |last=Westerman }}</ref> The band's musical style has been described as "nü-metal tinged thrash"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/ministry-carpenter-brut-and-alien-weaponry-get-weird-in-new-york/ |title=Ministry, Carpenter Brut, and Alien Weaponry Get Weird in New York City |website=Kerrang! |access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref> and "thrashing groove-metal",<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/alien-weaponry-how-teenage-band-channels-m%C4%81ori-heritage-haka-thrash-metal|title=Alien Weaponry: How Teenage Band Channels Māori Heritage Into Haka Thrash Metal|date=28 March 2018|website=Revolver|language=en|access-date=21 February 2019}}</ref> with the band naming [[Metallica]], [[Rage Against the Machine]], and [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] as inspirations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/rotorua-daily-post/news/news/article.cfm?c_id=1503437&objectid=12051088|title=Q&A with te reo Māori metal band Alien Weaponry|newspaper=The New Zealand Herald|date=14 May 2018|access-date=21 February 2019|language=en-NZ|issn=1170-0777}}</ref><ref name="Maninter">{{cite web |last1=Harris |first1=Brenton |title=Interview - Alien Weaponry Talk 'Tangaroa' And Bringing Māori History To The Metal Masses |url=https://www.maniacsonline.com.au/news/interview-alien-weaponry-talk-tangaroa-bringing-maori-history-to-the-metal-masses |website=Maniacs |access-date=26 September 2021 |date=20 September 2021}}</ref> They are also often likened to a Māori version of ''[[Roots (Sepultura album)|Roots]]''-era [[Sepultura]], both for their musical style and infusion of indigenous culture into their music.<ref name="auto"/>
