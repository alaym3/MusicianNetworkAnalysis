Hamlisch was a [[child prodigy]] and, by age five, he began mimicking the piano music he heard on the radio.

===Music for films===

In addition, Hamlisch co-wrote the song "[[California Nights]]" (also with Liebling), which was recorded by [[Lesley Gore]] for her 1967 hit album of the same name. The [[Bob Crewe]]-produced single peaked at No. 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] in March 1967, two months after Gore had performed the song on the ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' [[television show|television series]], in which she guest-starred as an accomplice to [[Julie Newmar]]'s [[Catwoman]].

It hit No. 1 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s Adult Contemporary chart and No. 3 on the Hot 100, selling nearly 2 million copies in the U.S. alone. He had great success in 1973, winning two [[Academy Awards]] for the [[The Way We Were (song)|title song]] and the score for the motion picture ''[[The Way We Were]]'' and an Academy Award for the adaptation score for ''The Sting''.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1355766489454| title=Academy Awards Database: 1973 music category winners| access-date=December 18, 2012| url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130415170526/http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1355766489454| archive-date=April 15, 2013}}</ref> He won four [[Grammy Award]]s in 1974, two for "The Way We Were". In 1975, he wrote what, for its first 12 years, would be the original theme music for ''[[Good Morning America]]''—it was built around four notes. He co-wrote "[[Nobody Does It Better]]" for ''[[The Spy Who Loved Me (film)|The Spy Who Loved Me]]'' (1977) with his then-girlfriend [[Carole Bayer Sager]], which would be nominated for an Oscar.<ref name="nyt" /> In the 1980s, he had success with the scores for ''[[Ordinary People]]'' (1980) and ''[[Sophie's Choice (film)|Sophie's Choice]]'' (1982).

===Stage===
Hamlisch's first major stage work was in 1972 playing piano for [[Groucho Marx]] at [[Carnegie Hall]] for ''[[An Evening with Groucho]]''. Hamlisch acted as both [[straight man]] and accompanist while Marx, at age 81, reminisced about his career in show business.<ref>{{cite journal| url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/12/August/09Author_Michael_Levin_Remembers_Marvin_Hamlisch.shtml| title=Author Michael Levin Remembers Marvin Hamlisch| date=August 7, 2012| journal=AntiMusic| access-date=August 9, 2012}}</ref> The performances were released as a two-record set, and remained very popular.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/marx.htm| title=Timbuctoo| website=An Evening With Groucho Marx| access-date=December 14, 2020}}</ref>

He then composed the scores for the 1975 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[A Chorus Line]]'', for which he won both a [[Tony Award]] and a [[Pulitzer Prize]]; and for the 1978 musical ''[[They're Playing Our Song]]'', loosely based on his relationship with [[Carole Bayer Sager]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/feature.php/37088/marvin-hamlisch| archive-url=https://archive.today/20130421102215/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/obituaries/feature.php/37088/marvin-hamlisch| url-status=dead| archive-date=2013-04-21| title=Accounts}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 1980s, his romantic relationship with Bayer Sager ended, but their songwriting relationship continued.
