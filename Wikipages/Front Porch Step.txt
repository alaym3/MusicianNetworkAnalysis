==History==
Front Porch Step began in 2012. In 2013, Front Porch Step signed to [[Pure Noise Records]] and released his debut album Aware. In 2013, he supported [[Never Shout Never]] on four of their tour dates.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crane|first1=Matt|title=Front Porch Step to tour with Never Shout Never|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/front_porch_step_to_tour_with_never_shout_never|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=16 December 2014}}</ref> In the summer of 2014, Front Porch Step played on the [[Vans Warped Tour]]. In the fall of 2014, Front Porch Step played on the Pure Noise Records Tour with [[State Champs]], [[Handguns (band)|Handguns]],  [[Forever Came Calling]], Brigades and Heart to Heart.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Tyler|title=Handguns, Forever Came Calling added to Pure Noise Records Tour|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/handguns_forever_came_calling_added_to_pure_noise_records_tour|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=16 December 2014}}</ref> In February and March 2015, Front Porch Step planned to go on his first headlining tour, with support from [[Have Mercy (band)|Have Mercy]], Alcoa, [[Hotel Books]], and Head North. Due to sexual harassment allegations, Mcelfresh has suspended his tour until further notice.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sharp|first1=Tyler|title=Front Porch Step announces tour with Have Mercy, Alcoa, Head North, more|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/front_porch_step_announces_tour_with_have_mercy_alcoa_head_north_more|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref> Front Porch Step was going to partake in the 2015 [[Vans Warped Tour]], which is held annually throughout the summer,  but was removed from the tour due to the allegations brought up against him.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crane|first1=Matt|title=Neck Deep, Palisades, Front Porch Step, Handguns, more announced for Warped Tour 2015|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/neck_deep_palisades_front_porch_step_handguns_more_announced_for_warped_tou|publisher=Alternative Press|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref>

On June 2, 2016, after a year long hiatus due to sexual harassment allegations, Mcelfresh returned with the release of a song called 'Help Me Hurt' to Spotify.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/frontporchstep/posts/773260572774783|title=Front Porch Step|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>

==Sexual harassment controversies==
Jake McElfresh has been accused by several young people of sexual harassment through mobile phones, including sending nude pictures of himself to underaged girls.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Coscarelli|first1=Joe|title=A Pop-Punk Singer and the Blurred Line Between Digital Fan Mail and Trouble|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/01/10/arts/music/front-porch-step-is-accused-of-misconduct-with-teenagers-online.html?_r=0|work=New York Times|access-date=10 January 2015}}</ref> This led to a petition demanding he be removed from the 2015 [[Warped Tour]]. His record label, [[Pure Noise Records]], and [[Kevin Lyman]], creator of the Warped Tour, announced they were aware of the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shotwell|first1=James|title=FRONT PORCH STEP ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT, LABEL RESPONDS|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/12/30/front-porch-step-accused-of-sexual-harassment-label-responds/|access-date=30 December 2014|work=Under the Gun Review|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=30 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230232316/http://www.underthegunreview.net/2014/12/30/front-porch-step-accused-of-sexual-harassment-label-responds/|archive-date=30 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 4 January 2015 McElfresh announced via his Facebook page that he had suspended all current tour dates, including Warped Tour, due to the allegations.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shotwell|first1=James|title=Front Porch Step Issues New Statement, Cancels All Tour Plans|url=http://www.underthegunreview.net/2015/01/04/front-porch-step-issues-new-statement-cancels-all-tour-plans/|access-date=11 January 2015|work=Under the Gun Review|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|date=4 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113085736/http://www.underthegunreview.net/2015/01/04/front-porch-step-issues-new-statement-cancels-all-tour-plans/|archive-date=13 January 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>
On 3 April 2015, McElfresh issued a public statement via [[Facebook]]. In it, he explained that when growing up, he had self-esteem issues and "certainly was not a ladies man," and when he finally got his breakthrough with music, he was surprised at how much attention from female fans he received. He admitted that he had corresponded through text messages with women, some of whom were underaged, but claimed that the conversations were "not as one sided as they seem," pointing out that no charges had been brought against him. He also stated that even though some of the conversations were sexual in nature, "(he) only had conversations with willing participants". McElfresh then admitted that [he] "wondered if (he) wanted to be alive anymore" in the few months after the allegations were brought up, and took a break from social media after being dropped by his label and removed from all tours, considering it the "greatest thing (he) could have ever done". He also stated that he intends to return to music in the summer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/frontporchstep/posts/610329782401197|title=Front Porch Step|website=www.facebook.com}}</ref>

On 1 July 2015, McElfresh performed his first show since the allegations were brought, at the Acoustic Basement at the Nashville, Tennessee stop of Warped Tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/front_porch_step_reportedly_playing_warped_tour_today/|title=Front Porch Step reportedly playing Warped Tour today - UPDATED|first=Tyler|last=Sharp|date=1 July 2015}}</ref> Warped Tour founder [[Kevin Lyman]] stated that he had spoken with McElfresh's personal counselor, who said that the performance would be a part of his therapy, he would not be paid for the show, and he would not appear at any other stops of the tour. Lyman stated that he allowed McElfresh to perform the show because he has not been charged with a misdemeanor, stating that "If he was a legitimate danger to anyone, he simply wouldn't be here.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/warped_tours_kevin_lyman_responds_to_front_porch_step_controversy_exclusive/|title=Warped Tour's Kevin Lyman responds to Front Porch Step controversy (exclusive)|date=2 July 2015}}</ref>" Many bands tweeted their opinions of the situation, practically all in distaste.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/musicians_react_to_front_porch_step_playing_warped_tour/|title=Musicians react to Front Porch Step playing Warped Tour|first=Tyler|last=Sharp|date=1 July 2015}}</ref> McElfresh also dealt with a concertgoer in the crowd who publicly criticized him, saying "The difference between you and me is that I know who I am, and I am very proud of that. So you can go ahead, watch my set. Thank you very much. Thanks for the ticket money, dude.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/front_porch_step_makes_opening_statement_at_warped_tour_i_know_who_i_am/|title=Front Porch Step makes opening statement at Warped Tour: "I know who I am"|first=Tyler|last=Sharp|date=1 July 2015}}</ref>"

The controversy was the subject of a song by [[Stray from the Path]] entitled "D.I.E.P.I.G.", which attacks musicians who use their fame to abuse young girls.<ref>[http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/stray_from_the_path_attack_sexual_predators_on_d.i.e.p.i.g_exclusive Stray From The Path attack sexual predators on “D.I.E.P.I.G” (exclusive)] AltPress. 3 August 2015. Retrieved 5 August 2015.</ref>

On June 2, 2016 McElfresh released his first single in over a year, "Help Me Hurt", a Christian song vaguely addressing the allegations and asking God for forgiveness.
