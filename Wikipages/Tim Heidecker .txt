Tim plays "Tom," the protagonist of the show. He continually brings his ideas to the Mayor (played by Wareheim), who ends up thwarting them in most cases and leaving Tom worse off than when he started. According to their website, Wareheim and Heidecker had mailed copies of an early version of the show to comedian [[Bob Odenkirk]], who agreed to take on the project as the executive producer of the series and sold it to Adult Swim.<ref>{{cite news | url =https://www.variety.com/article/VR1117946848.html?categoryid=2242&cs=1 | title = 10 Comics to Watch: Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim | first = Janelle | last = Brown | work = [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] | date = 2006-07-17 | access-date = 2007-02-16 }}</ref>

On October 23, 2020, Heidecker released his first stand-up comedy special, ''[[An Evening with Tim Heidecker|An Evening With Tim Heidecker]]'', on YouTube.

[[File:TimHeidecker(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|alt=Heidecker with a guitar|thumb|Heidecker performing]]
Heidecker played in various [[indie rock]] bands while in Philadelphia. He made an appearance in the 2008 [[Ben Folds]] and [[Regina Spektor]] music video entitled "[[You Don't Know Me (Ben Folds song)|You Don't Know Me]]".

Although Davin Wood composed the music for ''Awesome Show'', Heidecker would sometimes sing and write lyrics. [[Williams Street Records]] released both ''Awesome Record, Great Songs!'' and ''Uncle Muscles Presents Casey And His Brother'' in 2008, featuring music from the first two seasons. Wood previously composed the music for ''Tom Goes To The Mayor'', and he and Heidecker form the duo Heidecker & Wood. Inspired by 1970s soft rock, they released their first album, ''Starting From Nowhere'', on March 15, 2011.<ref>Hudson, Alex.

In December 2013, Heidecker released the album ''Urinal St. Station'' under the Drag City label with his band, The Yellow River Boys.<ref>[http://www.dragcity.com/products/urinal-st-station Urinal St. Station, by the Yellow River Boys].
