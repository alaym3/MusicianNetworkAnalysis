== Early life ==
Kamakawiwoʻole was born at [[Kuakini Medical Center]] in [[Honolulu]] to Henry "Hank" Kaleialoha Naniwa Kamakawiwoʻole Jr. and Evangeline "Angie" Leinani Kamakawiwoʻole. The notable Hawaiian musician [[Moe Keale]] was his uncle and a major musical influence. Kamakawiwoʻole was raised in the community of [[Kaimuki]], where his parents had met and married.

He began playing music with his older brother Skippy and cousin Allen Thornton at the age of 11, being exposed to the music of Hawaiian entertainers of the time such as [[Peter Moon (musician)|Peter Moon]], Palani Vaughn, and [[Don Ho]], who frequented the establishment where Kamakawiwoʻole's parents worked. Hawaiian musician Del Beazley spoke of the first time he heard Kamakawiwoʻole perform, when, whilst playing for a graduation party, the whole room fell silent on hearing him sing.<ref name=npr>{{cite news |title=Israel Kamakawiwo'ole: The Voice of Hawaii |first=Renee |last=Montagne |url=https://www.npr.org/2010/12/06/131812500/israel-kamakawiwo-ole-the-voice-of-hawaii |work=[[NPR]] |access-date=October 10, 2012 |date=March 9, 2011}}</ref> He remained in Hawaii as his brother Skippy entered the Army in 1971 and his cousin Allen moved to the mainland in 1976.

In his early teens, he studied at [[Upward Bound]] (UB) of the [[University of Hawaii at Hilo]] and his family moved to [[Mākaha]]. There he met Louis Kauakahi, Sam Gray, and Jerome Koko.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.hawaii.edu/~hartwell/music.htm |title=Article by Jay Hartwell of the University of Hawaiʻi at Manoa |publisher=hawaii.edu |date=May 26, 1991 |access-date=January 24, 2011}}</ref> Together with Skippy, they formed the [[Makaha Sons of Niʻihau]]. A part of the [[Hawaiian Renaissance]], the band's blend of contemporary and traditional styles gained in popularity as they toured Hawaii and the mainland United States, releasing fifteen successful albums. Kamakawiwoʻole's aim was to make music that stayed true to the typical sound of traditional Hawaiian music. His cousin, [[Bill Keale]], is also a musician.

== Music career ==
The [[Mākaha Sons|Makaha Sons of Niʻihau]] recorded ''No Kristo'' in 1976 and released several more albums, including ''Hoʻoluana'', ''Kahea O Keale'', ''Keala'', ''Makaha Sons of Niʻihau'' and ''Mahalo Ke Akua''.

The group became Hawaii's most popular contemporary traditional group with breakout albums 1984's ''Puana Hou Me Ke Aloha'' and its follow-up, 1986's ''Hoʻola''. Kamakawiwoʻole's last recorded album with the group was 1991's ''Hoʻoluana''. It remains the group's top-selling CD. In 1982, Skippy died at age 28 of a heart attack<ref name="Kekoa"/> related to [[obesity]]. Later the same year, Kamakawiwoʻole married his childhood sweetheart Marlene. Soon after, they had a daughter whom they named Ceslie-Ann "Wehi" Kamakawiwoʻole (born {{Circa|1983}}).

In 1990, Kamakawiwoʻole released his first [[solo album]] ''[[Ka ʻAnoʻi]]'', which won awards for Contemporary Album of the Year and Male Vocalist of the Year from the [[Hawai'i Academy of Recording Arts|Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts]] (HARA). ''[[Facing Future]]'' was released in 1993 by [[The Mountain Apple Company]]. It featured a version of his most popular song, the [[Medley (music)|medley]] "[[Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World]]" (listed as "Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World"), along with "Hawaiʻi 78", "White Sandy Beach of Hawaiʻi", "Maui Hawaiian Sup'pa Man", and "Kaulana Kawaihae". The decision to include a cover of "[[Over the Rainbow|Somewhere Over the Rainbow]]" was said to be a last-minute one by his producer [[Jon de Mello]] and Kamakawiwoʻole.<ref name="Chasing Rainbows">{{closed access}} {{cite journal |last=Guerin |first=Ada |title=Chasing Rainbows |journal=The Hollywood Reporter – International Edition |volume=394 |issue=32 |date=June 6, 2006 |pages=M419 |publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]] |location=Los Angeles, CA, USA |issn=0018-3660 |url=http://0-ic.galegroup.com.ignacio.usfca.edu/ic/bic1/MagazinesDetailsPage/MagazinesDetailsWindow?failOverType=&query=&prodId=BIC1&windowstate=normal&contentModules=&mode=view&displayGroupName=Magazines&limiter=&currPage=&disableHighlighting=false&source=&sortBy=&displayGroups=&action=e&catId=&activityType=&scanId=&documentId=GALE%7CA147302617 |access-date=October 10, 2012}} {{subscription required}}</ref> ''Facing Future'' debuted at No.{{nbs}}25 on [[Billboard Magazine|''Billboard'' magazine]]'s Top Pop Catalogue chart.

In 1994, Kamakawiwoʻole was voted favorite entertainer of the year by the Hawaiʻi Academy of Recording Arts (HARA). ''[[E Ala E]]'' (1995) featured the political title song "ʻE Ala ʻE" and "[[Kaleohano]]", and ''[[N Dis Life]]'' (1996) featured "In This Life" and "Starting All Over Again".

In 1997, Kamakawiwoʻole was again honored by HARA at the [[Na Hoku Hanohano Awards|Annual Nā Hōkū Hanohano awards]] for Male Vocalist of the Year, Favorite Entertainer of the Year, Album of the Year, and Island Contemporary Album of the Year. He watched the awards ceremony from a hospital room.

Kamakawiwoʻole's ''Facing Future'' has become the best-selling Hawaiian album of all time.<ref name=npr/>

== Support of Hawaiian rights ==
Kamakawiwoʻole was known for promoting Hawaiian rights and [[Hawaiian sovereignty movement|Hawaiian independence]], both through his lyrics, which often stated the case for independence directly and through his own actions.<ref>Carroll, Rick. Iz: Voice of the People. Honolulu, Hawai'i: Bess, 2006. Print.</ref> For example, the lyric in his song "Hawaiʻi '78": "The life of this land is the life of the people/and that to care for the land (malama ʻāina) is to care for the Hawaiian culture", is a statement that many consider summarizing his Hawaiian ideals.<ref>Israel Kamakawiwo'ole. "Hawai'i '78." Facing Future. Mountain Apple Company, 1993. MP3.</ref> The [[state motto]] of Hawaiʻi is a recurring line in the song and encompasses the meaning of his message: "Ua Mau ke Ea o ka ʻĀina i ka Pono" (proclaimed by [[King Kamehameha III]] when Hawaiʻi regained sovereignty in 1843. It can be roughly translated as: "The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.netstate.com/states/mottoes/hi_motto.htm |title=Hawaii State Motto Ua Mau Ke Ea O Ka Aina I Ka Pono The life of the land is perpetuated in righteousness |publisher=Netstate.com |access-date=March 19, 2013}}</ref>

Kamakawiwoʻole used his music to promote awareness of his belief that a second-class status had been pushed onto fellow natives by the tourist industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tranquada |first=Jim |title=The Ukulele: a History |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=2012 |page=166 |isbn=978-0-8248-3544-6}}</ref>

A 2014 [[Pixar]] short film, ''[[Lava (2014 film)|Lava]]'', features two volcanoes as the main characters.

In 1988, a friend of Kamakawiwoʻole called a Honolulu recording studio owned by Milan Bertosa at 3:00 am with a request that Kamakawiwoʻole be allowed to come in to make a recording. Bertosa was about to shut down, but told the friend that Kamakawiwoʻole could come if he was able to make it within 15 minutes. In a 2011 interview, Bertosa recalled, "In walks the largest human being I had seen in my life. Israel was probably like 500 pounds. And the first thing at hand is to find something for him to sit on." A security guard gave Kamakawiwoʻole a large steel chair. "Then I put up some microphones, do a quick sound check, roll tape, and the first thing he does is 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow.' He played and sang, one take, and it was over."<ref name=npr/>
