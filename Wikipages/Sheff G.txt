== Early life ==

Sheff G, before getting into music, joined the 83 (Eight Tray) Gangsta Crips at 12, and was locked up for 2 years for a felony [[gun charge]] and robbery in 2015 at 17 before getting released in 2017. Sheff, when asked about his childhood before rap said:
"Growing up, all I was around was violence, in school, or hanging with my niggas, it was rough in the streets. I had to be protected out there, so I rolled with the 83s, we was in Flatbush especially on my block, I was a block baby you heard like niggas kno my body. I would never think rapping would be n my future. I remember in 2014, at 15, we was growing up watching GS9 the G-Stone Crips get big, and they from the 90s on the East side, and I would be like 'damn, imagine I'm like that.' But it was a dream then."
