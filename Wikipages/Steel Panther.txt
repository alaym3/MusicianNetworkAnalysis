'''Steel Panther''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], California, mostly known for its profane and humorous lyrics,<ref name="Steel Panther Lyrics Analyzed">{{cite web|url=http://blog.leebobblack.com/2013/03/Steel-Panther-lyrics-analyzed-by-Lee-Bob-Black.html |title=Steel Panther Lyrics Analyzed |publisher=Lee Bob Black |date=March 21, 2013 |access-date=February 14, 2015}}</ref> as well as its exaggerated on-stage [[pastiche]] of the stereotypical  "[[glam metal]]" lifestyle.

==History==

=== Metal Shop / Metal Skool (2000–2007)===
The quartet began to gain popularity on the [[Sunset Strip]] during the early 2000s under the name Metal Shop (soon changed into Metal Skool, then into Steel Panther). Their lineup consists of vocalist [[Ralph Saenz]] ("Michael Starr"), drummer Darren Leader ("Stix Zadinia"), bassist Travis Haley ("Lexxi Foxx"), and guitarist [[Russ Parrish]] ("Satchel").<ref name="allmusic.com"/> The band did weekly shows on Monday nights at the Viper Room, and subsequently the Key Club, playing covers of hair metal hits while sharing their passion for the bands that made the songs famous. Despite the name changes and Saenz and Parrish putting in time in the [[Van Halen]] tribute band Atomic Punks, they finally managed to gain some success.<ref name="allmusic.com" /> In 2003 they released ''Hole Patrol'',<ref name="musicmight.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/los+angeles/steel+panther |title=Steel Panther |publisher=musicmight.com |access-date=October 31, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195110/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/los+angeles/steel+panther |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref> their self-produced debut extended play. The band appeared in a [[Discover Card]] advertisement as Danger Kitty and in the sitcom ''[[Drew Carey Show]]'' as themselves. Also in 2003, their song "Death to All But Metal" was included in a compilation CD called ''Hey, That's What I Call Sludge! Vol. 1'' put out by the Metal Sludge web site. Their cover of the song "[[Fantasy (Aldo Nova song)|Fantasy]]" by [[Aldo Nova]] was used as the opening musical theme for the [[MTV]] program ''[[Rob Dyrdek's Fantasy Factory]]''. On November 27, 2007 Metal Skool played original songs as well as covers of KISS songs at the Gene Simmons roast, they can be seen in the background of Gene Simmons' reality show ''[[Gene Simmons Family Jewels]]''.
