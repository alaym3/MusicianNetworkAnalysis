In 2005, Kirkpatrick started to produce [[Little Big Town]] alongside the group starting with their second album [[The Road to Here]] and also the next 2 [[A Place to Land (Little Big Town album)|A Place to Land]] & [[The Reason Why]].

He has solo writing credits on one song, "Looking for the Reason", with the rest written with him and part/all of the group or with other songwriters. He co-wrote with group members on their highest-charting song "Bring It On Home", which made it to No.&nbsp;4 on Hot Country 100 songs chart.
