'''Faster Pussycat''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1985 by vocalist [[Taime Downe]], guitarists [[Brent Muscat]] and Greg Steele and bassist [[Kelly Nickels]]. The group has since gone through numerous line-up changes leaving Downe as the only constant member. They broke up in 1993, but reformed in 2001. Faster Pussycat has released four studio albums to date: ''[[Faster Pussycat (album)|Faster Pussycat]]'' (1987), ''[[Wake Me When It's Over]]'' (1989), ''[[Whipped!]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Power and the Glory Hole]]'' (2006). They were one of the most successful [[hard rock]] bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s, having sold over two million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/faster-pussycat-frontman-slams-brent-muscat-s-tribute-band|title=FASTER PUSSYCAT Frontman Slams BRENT MUSCAT's 'Tribute Band'|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 24, 2007|access-date=September 25, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===Early years (1985&ndash;1987)===
Faster Pussycat was formed in [[Hollywood]] by [[Taime Downe]] during the [[glam metal]] and [[glam punk]] boom of the 1980s.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|page=159}}</ref> The earliest incarnation of the band featured Downe and Greg Steele along with [[Brent Muscat]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The name of the band is derived from the [[Russ Meyer]] film ''[[Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

After multiple early personnel changes, Faster Pussycat consisted of Downe (vocals), Steele (guitar), Muscat (guitar), [[Kelly Nickels]] (bass) and Mark Michals (drums).<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

Just before the band recorded their debut album, Nickels got into a motorcycle accident and broke his leg in seven places. He was replaced by Eric Stacy from Champagne Darling Cool. Shortly thereafter, Nickels joined [[L.A. Guns]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

===Rise to fame (1987&ndash;1993)===
The band signed a record contract with [[Elektra Records]], which released their debut album ''[[Faster Pussycat (album)|Faster Pussycat]]'' in 1987.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The band established a following among heavy metal, [[glam rock]] and sleaze rock fans, mainly through two promotional videos from the first album for the songs "[[Bathroom Wall]]" and "Don't Change That Song". In November 1987, the band appeared on the cover of ''[[Screamer Magazine]]'' 's debut issue. In the United States the band toured with [[Alice Cooper]], [[David Lee Roth]] and [[Motörhead]] in support of the album.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

Also in 1987, Faster Pussycat appeared in the [[rockumentary]] film ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization II|The Decline of Western Civilization part 2 - The Metal Years]]''. The band was interviewed and performed live versions of "Cathouse" and "Bathroom Wall".{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Two years later, Faster Pussycat recorded their most successful album, ''[[Wake Me When It's Over]]''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The album earned "[[RIAA certification|Gold]]" status from the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. Sales were mainly driven by the hit single "House of Pain". Music videos were produced for "House of Pain" and "Poison Ivy". While the band was touring for the album in 1990, drummer Mark Michals was arrested in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] and fired from the band after signing for a package of heroin addressed to himself.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> [[Frankie Banali]] of [[Quiet Riot]] filled in as drummer for the remainder of the tour, after which Brett Bradshaw became the long-term drummer.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>  Tours with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and [[Mötley Crüe]] followed.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

In 1990, the band recorded a cover of [[Carly Simon]]'s "[[You're So Vain]]" for a compilation called ''Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary'' and filmed a video. The song was later included on the 1992 ''[[Belted, Buckled And Booted]]'' EP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.spirit-of-metal.com/en/album/Belted,_Buckled_and_Booted/19899|title=Faster Pussycat : Belted, Buckled and Booted|website=Spirit-of-metal.com|access-date=July 17, 2021}}</ref>

In 1992, the band released their third album, ''[[Whipped!]]'',<ref name="LarkinHR"/> which peaked at number 90 on the chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/whipped-mw0000082990|title=Whipped - Faster Pussycat &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=July 17, 2021}}</ref>

In 1993, Faster Pussycat parted ways with Stacy and hired Aaron Abellira to replace him. They embarked on a warmup tour, an American tour and then some shows in Japan. Most of the shows were sold out. They also played one last sold-out show in Hollywood at the Hollywood Palace.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Break-up (1993)===
A few weeks after returning to the U.S., Faster Pussycat broke up, its members going their separate ways.<ref name="LarkinHR"/>

Downe was involved with industrial musical act [[Pigface]],<ref name="LarkinHR"/> before forming his own [[industrial rock]] act with Kyle Kyle of [[Bang Tango]] called [[the Newlydeads]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Reunion and change of musical style (2001&ndash;2005)===
In 2001, Faster Pussycat reformed with original members Downe (vocals), Muscat (guitar) and Steele (guitar), alongside Downe's former Newlydeads bandmates [[Xristian Simon]] (guitar), [[Danny Nordahl]] (bass) and [[Chad Stewart]] (drums). Nordahl had also played in [[the Throbs]], and Nordahl and Chad Stewart also both play in Motochrist.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motochrist.net/ |title=MOTOCHRIST evil is as evil does |publisher=Motochrist.net |access-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426005009/http://www.motochrist.net/ |archive-date=2012-04-26 }}</ref>

A remix compilation, ''[[Between the Valley of the Ultra Pussy]]'', was released the same year, featuring [[Industrial rock|industrial-rock]] remixes of the band's classic tracks, along with a bonus cover of Kiss's "I Was Made For Loving You". However, this divided fans, as many of the older fanbase who enjoyed standard [[hard rock]] were not familiar with industrial rock.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Steele left the band halfway through the 2001 headlining reunion tour. [[Tracii Guns]] filled in as guitarist for the rest of the tour, after which Faster Pussycat continued as a five-piece. [[Eric Griffin]] from [[Murderdolls]], Synical and (later) Wednesday 13 filled in as guitarist for the American tour, as Muscat's scheduling conflicts prevented him from participating.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=35824 |title=MURDERDOLLS' GRIFFIN Fills In On Guitar For FASTER PUSSYCAT: Photos Available |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2012-05-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050424200636/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=35824 |archive-date=2005-04-24 }}</ref> Muscat returned briefly, until oral cancer sidelined him in late summer of 2005, and he was temporarily replaced by Michael Thomas, an arrangement that would become permanent when Muscat chose not to return to the line-up.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Name dispute and Brent Muscat's Faster Pussycat line-up (2006&ndash;2007) ===
In December 2006, three former original Faster Pussycat members, Brent Muscat, Eric Stacy and Brett Bradshaw, along with Underground Rebels vocalist Kurt Frohlich and Sin City Sinners guitarist Todd Kerns, began performing under the name Faster Pussycat, creating two versions of the band, both claiming to be the original. Muscat claimed that this was to allow fans to hear Faster Pussycat tracks played the way they were originally recorded, as opposed to the industrial-rock version of the band that he said Downe continued to front. Muscat also made a legal claim to the name Faster Pussycat.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}

Muscat's Faster Pussycat line-up agreed to play the [[AVN (magazine)|AVN]] Awards after-party at the Dive Bar in Las Vegas, Nevada. According to a press release, the band—which did not include Downe—would perform "all classic tracks, no remixes, no B.S."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=64856 |title=Brent Muscat'S Faster Pussycat To Perform At Avn Awards After-Party In Las Vegas |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108043747/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=64856 |archive-date=2007-01-08 }}</ref>

Downe posted a bulletin on [[Myspace]] saying Faster Pussycat was not playing in Las Vegas and that Muscat's version was a "tribute band."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=67691 |title=FASTER PUSSYCAT Frontman Slams BRENT MUSCAT's 'Tribute Band' |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070227215612/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=67691 |archive-date=2007-02-27 }}</ref> Muscat responded that he donated all his earnings from the gig, and planned to donate a portion of any future earnings, to cancer research. In various interviews, Downe disputed Muscat's version of events and indicated that the issue was being dealt with via the courts.<ref>[https://www.afternic.com/forsale/glam-metal.com?utm_source=TDFS&utm_medium=sn_affiliate_click&utm_campaign=TDFS_GoDaddy_DLS&traffic_type=TDFS&traffic_id=GoDaddy_DLS] {{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110708013045/http://www.blasting-zone.com/FasterPussycat1.htm] {{dead link|date=July 2021}}</ref>

In February 2007, Brent issued this statement on his Myspace blog:

{{blockquote|In 2000 Taime made an awful remix cd. It was not until Greg Steele and I threatened him with legal action that we were paid and invited to join our own band. In 2005 I was diagnosed with oral cancer. The band which I had been part of for 20 years all of a sudden replaced me and lied about my condition. I was very hurt that Taime never bothered to call me once. As a result of Taime's drunken and erratic performances, the price for Faster Pussycat live performances plummeted and fans have voiced their displeasure. I decided I would attempt to reunite the band to commemorate our 20th anniversary. I invited both Greg and Taime, (which is more than he did for me) but neither responded.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}}}

In a March 2007 interview with an Italian publication, Muscat stated:

{{blockquote|I love Taime but I believe he is caught up in a dark, fake and lonely place, where the people around him kiss his ass and then talk shit behind his back.. They use him for his drugs and ride his coat tails... Hollywood has been dead for a few years now... I'm so glad I got away from there and moved to Las Vegas. What is most sad about this, is the fact that I'm one of Taime's only real friends and he is too messed up to see it.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}}}

On April 21, 2007, Muscat circulated via Myspace an open invitation to Downe and Steele to reunite, along with Stacy and Bradshaw.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70935 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120912050245/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70935 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-12 |title=Faster Pussycat'S Muscat Issues 'Open Letter' To Taime Downe, Greg Steele |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-18 }}</ref> There was no response from Downe. Brent's version of Faster Pussycat toured Europe in Spring 2007 with Frohlich replacing Downe on vocals along with Kerns on guitar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70774 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120909184559/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=70774 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=BRENT MUSCAT's FASTER PUSSYCAT: More Tour Dates Announced |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-18 }}</ref>

In July 2007, Muscat decided to drop the battle to use the name Faster Pussycat,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=76197 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120908042452/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=76197 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-08 |title=Brent Muscat Drops Legal Battle Over Faster Pussycat Name |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-18 }}</ref> and has since started a band called [[Sin City Sinners]].<ref>{{cite web|author=US |url=http://www.myspace.com/scsinners |title=Sin City Sinners - LAS VEGAS, Nevada - Rock - |publisher=MySpace.com |access-date=2011-07-18}}</ref> Brent has stated in an interview that "Faster Pussycat is dead."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/muscat.shtml |title=Brent Muscat Interview |publisher=Sleaze Roxx |date=2008-01-20 |access-date=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019184511/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/muscat.shtml |archive-date=2011-10-19 }}</ref>

Downe continued with the name Faster Pussycat, performing at [[Rocklahoma]] in July 2007. During the band's set, Downe went on a tirade, referencing Muscat's cancer and stating his wish that Muscat would die, which received a poor reception from both the crowd and journalists. He then cut the set short and left the stage without playing several of the band's biggest hits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaccessmagazine.com/vol5/issue08/rocklahoma.html |title=Rocklahoma 2007 :: All Access Magazine :: It's All About The Music |publisher=All Access Magazine |date=2007-08-16 |access-date=2011-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719142834/http://www.allaccessmagazine.com/vol5/issue08/rocklahoma.html |archive-date=2011-07-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
