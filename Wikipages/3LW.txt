'''3LW''' ([[initialism]] of "'''3''' '''L'''ittle '''W'''omen") was an American [[girl group]] that enjoyed a number of modest hits during the early 2000s. Its founding members are [[Adrienne Bailon]], [[Kiely Williams]], and [[Naturi Naughton]]. Jessica Benson later replaced Naughton after she left the group in 2002. 3LW was signed to the label [[Epic Records]], and later moved to [[So So Def Recordings|So So Def]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1479771/20031015/3lw.jhtml |title=3LW : 3LW Sign To So So Def, Ask 50 Cent To Get 'Gangsta' With Them – Rhapsody Music Downloads |publisher=VH1 |access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref> They are best known for their hit singles "[[No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)]]", "[[Playas Gon' Play]]" and "[[I Do (Wanna Get Close to You)]]".

==History==
===1999–2002: ''3LW''===
In 1999, the original line up of 3LW formed. Their debut single, "[[No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)]]", was released in the fall of 2000. "No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)" was a chart success, and was followed by "[[Playas Gon' Play]]" in early 2001. The group's self-titled debut album, ''[[3LW (album)|3LW]]'' was released on December 5, 2000. The album went on to be certified platinum by the [[RIAA]], selling 1.3 million copies in the US.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/72110/3lw-is-a-trio-again |title=3LW Is A Trio Again |website=Billboard |publication-date=March 4, 2003 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620193012/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/72110/3lw-is-a-trio-again |archive-date=June 20, 2014 |access-date=March 15, 2010}}</ref> In the summer of 2001, the group embarked on the [[MTV]] [[Total Request Live Tour]] along with [[Destiny's Child]], [[Dream (American group)|Dream]], [[Nelly]], [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]], and [[Jessica Simpson]].

In 2001, 3LW recorded "[[What More Can I Give]]" as part of a [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] of various artists including [[Michael Jackson]], [[Reba McEntire]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Celine Dion|Céline Dion]], and [[Mariah Carey]] in response to the [[September 11 attacks]]. In late 2001 they collaborated with [[Romeo Miller|Lil' Romeo]] and [[Nick Cannon]] for "Parents Just Don't Understand" on the ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius (film)|Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]'' soundtrack.

3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled ''Same Game, Different Rules''. The album and its intended lead single "Uh Oh" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough [[Urban contemporary|urban]] radio appeal. The tracks from ''Same Game, Different Rules'' were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go Of 3LW' (after their song "Never Let Go") gained traction, and the act was retained.

===2002–2004: ''A Girl Can Mack'' and ''The Cheetah Girls''===
Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the [[P. Diddy]]-produced single "[[I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)]]", featuring [[Loon (rapper)|Loon]]. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on [[Nickelodeon]] titled ''Live on Sunset''. By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, ''[[A Girl Can Mack]]'', when member Naughton left the group.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|last=Oh|first=Minya|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457117/20020821/3lw.jhtml|title=3LW Become 2LW – News Story|work=MTV News|date=August 21, 2002|access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref> In an interview on [[Wendy Williams]]' radio show, Naughton alleged that she had a number of conflicts with Bailon, Williams, and their management, which led to an August 2002 altercation involving a plate of food from [[KFC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/3LW/news_feature_081602/ |title=3LW: One Story, Two Sides|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=March 9, 2006|access-date=2010-03-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928095921/http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/3LW/news_feature_081602/|archive-date=September 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/3LW/news_feature_081602/index3.jhtml|title=3LW: One Story, Two Sides|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=March 9, 2006|access-date=2010-03-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419090229/http://www.mtv.com/bands/123/3LW/news_feature_081602/index3.jhtml|archive-date=April 19, 2009}}</ref> Naughton later claimed that she was forced out of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1457173/20020823/3lw.jhtml |title=3LW : Naturi Describes Alleged 3LW Fist Fight That Led To Split |publisher=[[VH1]]|access-date=2010-03-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090419124327/http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1457173/20020823/3lw.jhtml|archive-date=April 19, 2009|df=mdy}}</ref>

Williams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the "3LW" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as "2LW".<ref name=autogenerated1 />  The departure of Naughton greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of ''Sister 2 Sister'' magazine, Williams and Bailon said they received death threats. ''A Girl Can Mack'''s release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing. The album debuted at No. 15 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with a disappointing 53,000 copies sold in the first week.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1458421/santanas-shaman-blessed-foos-at-3-on-albums-chart/ |title=Santana's Shaman Blessed; Foos At #3 On Albums Chart |last=D'angelo |first=Joe |publication-date=2002-10-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912002202/http://www.mtv.com/news/1458421/santanas-shaman-blessed-foos-at-3-on-albums-chart/ |archive-date=September 12, 2014 |access-date=June 13, 2008}}</ref> After the second single released from the album, "[[Neva Get Enuf]]", underperformed, the group released a Christmas-themed LP ''[[Naughty or Nice (album)|Naughty or Nice]]'', which failed to appear on any major [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1457870/3lw-holiday-album-due-members-land-film-roles/|title=3LW Holiday Album Due; Members Land Film Roles|last=Moss|first=Corey|website=[[MTV News]]|date=September 30, 2002|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref>

In the midst of 3LW's public drama, Kiely Williams and Adrienne Bailon signed on to star in the [[Disney Channel]] original movie "[[The Cheetah Girls (film)|The Cheetah Girls]]" alongside [[Raven-Symoné]] and [[Sabrina Bryan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1457967/remaining-3lw-pair-too-busy-to-hold-auditions-for-new-member/|title=Remaining 3LW Pair Too Busy To Hold Auditions For New Member|last=Moss|first=Corey|website=[[MTV News]]|date=October 4, 2002|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1458400/3lw-dont-judge-others-by-color-of-their-spots-in-cheetah-girls/|title=3LW Don't Judge Others By Color Of Their Spots In 'Cheetah Girls'|last=Dangelo|first=Joe|website=[[MTV News]]|date=October 29, 2002|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> Over time, Williams and Bailon became more involved with [[Disney]]'s [[The Cheetah Girls (group)|the Cheetah Girls]], which eventually became a real recording group after the surprising success of the film and its [[The Cheetah Girls (soundtrack)|accompanying soundtrack]]. With the sudden success of the franchise, Williams and Bailon found themselves having to juggle activities for both 3LW and the Cheetah Girls simultaneously.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Gerri|url=http://www.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=7301|title=CHEETAH GIRLS 2|work=[[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]]|date=August 25, 2006}}</ref>

===2004–2008: ''Point of No Return'', image conflict, and breakup===
Due to Williams and Bailon's increasing involvement in the Cheetah Girls, progress on 3LW's third studio album, now titled ''Point of No Return'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1506341/jermaine-dupri-boosting-grown-up-3lw-with-their-sexy-return/|title=Jermaine Dupri Boosting Grown-Up 3LW With Their Sexy Return|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|website=[[MTV News]]|date=July 25, 2005|access-date=2019-12-09}}</ref> had halted.<ref>{{cite web|last=Moss|first=Corey|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1473478/20030701/3lw.jhtml|title=3LW Celebrate New Beginning|work=[[MTV News]]|date=July 2, 2003|access-date=2010-03-15}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/3lw/artist.jhtml |title=3LW |publisher=MTV |access-date=2010-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315033132/http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/3lw/artist.jhtml |archive-date=March 15, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sony.com/en_us/SCA/company-news/press-releases/sony-music-entertainment/2006/platinum-rb-female-group-3lw-set-to-release-their-third-anticipated-album-point-of-no-return-august-15th.html|work=Sony|date=May 22, 2006|title=Platinum R&B Female Group 3LW Set to Release Their Third Anticipated Album Point of No Return August 15th!!}}</ref> The lead-off single, "[[Feelin' You (3LW song)|Feelin' You]]", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. ''Point of No Return'' was set to be released on August 15, 2006, but got shelved indefinitely and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups and the album was never released. 

In early 2007, Bailon stated in ''Girls Life'' magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls. However, on January 7, 2008, Bailon confirmed in an interview with [[BlogTalkRadio]] that 3LW officially disbanded. Bailon and Williams then decided to pursue the Cheetah Girls franchise full-time, although the group itself would disband in the same year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Carter |first=Brooke |date=March 13, 2017 |title=What Happened to 3LW 2018 – News & Updates |url=https://gazettereview.com/2017/03/happened-3lw-news-updates/ |work=Gazette Review |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |access-date=2019-05-18 }}</ref>
