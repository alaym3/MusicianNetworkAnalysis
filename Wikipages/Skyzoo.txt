During Skyzoo's teenage years his father moved to [[South Jamaica, Queens]], and Skyzoo began spending much of his time there as well as in Brooklyn.

Skyzoo contributed most vocals, though guest vocalists such as [[Sean Price]], [[Guilty Simpson]], and [[Torae]].<ref name="cornerstorefri" /> The album was generally well-received,<ref name="hiphopdx.com" /><ref name="trskyzooclassicry" /> and ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'' gave it a positive rating of XL.<ref name="srpxxlcornerstore" /> In 2007, he stated that he had a sophomore studio album ready, called ''[[The Salvation (album)|The Salvation]]'', but was waiting for a major record deal before releasing it.<ref name="Rhett" /> In the spring of 2009, Skyzoo jointly signed to independent label [[Duck Down Records]] and to 9th Wonder's [[It's a Wonderful World Music Group|Jamla Records]] imprint.<ref name="ortezwedin" /> Skyzoo then went on to release the mixtape ''The Power of Words''.

Upon release Skyzoo described it as autobiographical and his most personal work.<ref name="SKTS3" /> Skyzoo had been planning this album since he was 9 years old,<ref name="streehip" /> and ''The Salvation'' provides an intricate view into his life and experiences.<ref name="SKTS3" /> Instead of bringing in a large number of guest artists, Skyzoo handles most of the vocals himself, explaining the "album isn't exactly the way I planned it out at 9-years-old, but it tells my story. With that being said, no one can help tell my story better than me."<ref name="nrpwired" />  About the selection of guest rappers, according to Skyzoo, "it wasn't really a 'who's hot, who's not' type of thing. It was more so 'just get what sounds right.'

}}
To promote the album, Skyzoo and director Mills Miller<ref name="szuentrapment" /> filmed a webisode series entitled ''Saving Our Grace''.<ref name="szsavingourgracet" /> The short documentaries were shot throughout New York City and showed six different characters, such as a single mother and a young drug dealer, each representing a different emotion displayed on the album. The series debuted on Skyzoo's official YouTube page in August 2009.<ref name="szvfortyseconds" />  Overall five official music videos were released from ''The Salvation'', starting with "The Necessary Evils" which was released in May 2008. The video was directed by Tee Smif of the production company KCCC and shows a teenage drug dealer attempting to change his lifestyle, and the highs and subsequent lows he faces.<ref name="stupeyoutube" /> On July 30, 2009, the video for "The Beautiful Decay", produced by 9th Wonder and directed by Artemus Jenkins, was released.<ref name="SKTS3" /> Following the release of the album, a video for the song "Popularity" was made and released on November 18, 2009. The video, directed by Todd Angkasuwan, is a parody on the popular high-school drama ''[[Saved by the Bell]]''.<ref name="salvideopop" /> Restless Films director Court Dunn directed the video for the third single "Easy To Fly.

The video is directed by Artemus Jenkins.<ref name="saldopboys" />

=== Mixtapes and collaborations (2010–2011) ===
{{See also|Live from the Tape Deck}}
Released on October 5, 2010, Skyzoo's collaborative EP with [[Illmind]] titled ''[[Live from the Tape Deck]]''<ref name="SI" /> was a free-form showcase of his lyricism.<ref name="livefromprefixmagainze" /> Unlike Skyzoo's debut album ''[[The Salvation (album)|The Salvation]]'', there largely aren't deeply personal themes in ''Live from the Tape Deck''. The album is a collection of "raw" hip hop with a cohesive backdrop. With this project, the two artists planned to bring what hip hop veterans such as [[Eric B. & Rakim]], [[Gang Starr]], [[EPMD]], [[N.W.A]] and [[A Tribe Called Quest]] brought by having one producer with one sound and one theme.<ref name="SI" /><ref name="livefromprefixmagainze" /><ref name="hiphopruckus" /> With the album, Skyzoo stated that his goal was "to make something that felt like a 2010 cassette tape. I wanted the content to be raw and lyric driven as always, but not as story driven or emotional as ''The Salvation'' was. There are still parts of the album that are stories and concepts, but not as much as my debut had. This one was more of a beats and rhymes type of album."<ref name="szslivefromthetakedeck" />  It was rated 'XL' (4/5) by ''XXL Magazine'', and received an 'XXL' (5/5) rating in the 'lyrics' category of the review.<ref name="XXLtapedeck" />

In 2011, Skyzoo amicably parted ways with 9th Wonder's Jamla Imprint, with the two remaining periodic collaborators. On June 7, 2011, Skyzoo released the free mixtape ''The Great Debater''. The project was sponsored by the [[Jordan Brand]], and featured the singles "The Definitive Prayer", "Test Drive", "Atypical", and "Written In The Drums".<ref name="szrjordanbrand" /><ref name="szpgreatdebot" /> Skyzoo has said that the project was created as a "thank you" gift to his fans for continuously purchasing and supporting his releases.<ref name="szomakingof" /> The project, 16 songs in total, contains almost all original production (excluding the [[N.E.R.D]] sampled "Inside Of Clouds" instrumental on "Could've Struck The Lotto")<ref name="szgreatdebatorn" /> from producers such as Illmind, 9th Wonder, Swiff D, Best Kept Secret, Oh No, and others.<ref name="szpgreatdebot" /> The cover art drew attention for its usage of characters from ''[[The Cosby Show]]''.<ref name="szpgreatdebot" /> Skyzoo has stated that ''The Great Debater'' is loosely based around the theme of achieving success in one's field, and that as a child he saw [[The Huxtables|the Huxtable family]] as a picture of success. This led to him wanting to portray success on the mixtape's cover as he'd envisioned it in his youth.<ref name="szomakingof" /> It was featured most major hip hop blogs,<ref name="szqbreakdsdown" /> and ''The Great Debater'' was rated 'XL' (4/5) by ''XXL Magazine'', where they stated Skyzoo "leaves nothing up for debate when it comes to his pen skills."<ref name="szgreatdebatorn" />

=== ''A Dream Deferred'' (2012) ===
{{See also|A Dream Deferred (album)}}
Skyzoo's sophomore full-length solo album, ''A Dream Deferred'', was released on October 2, 2012.<ref name="tracklistnews" /> The album is the follow up to his debut ''The Salvation'', and similar to his debut it focuses on an autobiographical writing form, with a larger musical scale.<ref name=exclaim /> The album features [[Jill Scott]], [[Freeway (rapper)|Freeway]], [[Raheem Devaughn]], and [[Talib Kweli]], and includes production by Illmind, 9th Wonder, Black Milk, and others.<ref name="tracklistnews" /> The first single, "JanSport Strings", was released on August 29, 2012. Additional singles include the [[Jahlil Beats]] produced "Range Rover Rhythm", and then Skyzoo' single "Spike Lee Was My Hero" featuring [[Talib Kweli]]. The video for the latter, directed by Alex Ghassan, includes cameos from [[Spike Lee]] himself, who upon hearing the song reached out to Skyzoo via Twitter to be involved in the video process.<ref name="szmspikelee" /> The video debuted on [[BET]]'s ''[[106 & Park]]'' as the "New Joint Of The Day" in January 2013.<ref name="szmspikelee" /> ''[[A Dream Deferred (album)|A Dream Deferred]]''  met with a largely positive critical response,<ref name=metacritic /> and became one of Skyzoo's best charting albums, reaching No. 7 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart and No. 18 on [[Top Rap Albums]] chart.<ref name="prpbillbhcart" /> The album received an 'XL' rating via ''[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]'',<ref name=xxl /> and at [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 86, which indicates "universal acclaim", based on 5 reviews.<ref name=metacritic />

Instead of sampling, Antman Wonder recreated the production with a live orchestra.<ref name="xrpplayerreasonabledoubt" /><ref name="wrpdxdoubt" /> It was generally well received by music critics, with publications such as HipHopDX giving it a positive review.<ref name="wrpdxdoubt" />
