'''Julia Brown''' is an American [[indie pop]] band from [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].

==History==
Julia Brown began in early 2013 after the break up of the band [[Teen Suicide (band)|Teen Suicide]], with the release of their debut studio album ''to be close to you'' via Birdtapes.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Greene|first1=Jayson|title=Julia Brown - To Be Close to You|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/18017-julia-brown-to-be-close-to-you/|publisher=Pitchfork|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=EP: Julia Brown – to be close to you|url=http://theup-turn.com/2013/02/22/ep-julia-brown-to-be-close-to-you/|publisher=The Up-Turn|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref> They would feature on a split with Modern Baseball and Old Grey the same year and toured throughout the year until their last concert in October, and the band fell inactive as Sam and Torts reformed [[American Pleasure Club|Teen Suicide]] with J2 on guitar soon after.

In 2014, Julia Brown released their second studio album independently (and on Joy Void Recordings in 2016), titled ''An Abundance of Strawberries''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ward|first1=Adam|title=Julia Brown - An Abundance of Strawberries|url=http://www.portalsmusic.com/2014/08/album-reflection/julia-brown-abundance-strawberries/|publisher=Portals Music|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=McDermott|first1=Patrick|title=Listen To Julia Brown's Self-Leaked "An Abundance of Strawberries"|url=http://www.thefader.com/2014/11/21/she-wants-to-die-by-an-abundance-of-strawberries|publisher=The Fader|accessdate=22 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Geffen|first1=Sasha|title=Beyonce, D'Angelo, and the albums that don't make year-end lists|url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2014/12/18/beyonce-dangelo-and-the-albums-that-dont-make-year-end-lists|publisher=Chicago Reader|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Scott|first1=Linzy|title=Music You May Be Interested In (It’s All Really Good!)|url=http://wrvu.org/music-you-may-be-interested-in-its-all-really-good/|publisher=WRVU|accessdate=23 June 2015}}</ref>
