'''Nektar''' (German for ''[[Nectar]]'') is an English [[progressive rock]] band originally based in Germany.

==Early history==
The band formed in [[Hamburg]], West Germany in 1969. The founding members were Englishmen Roye Albrighton on guitars and lead vocals, Allan "Taff" Freeman on keyboards, Derek "Mo" Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and artists Mick Brockett and Keith Walters on lights and "special effects". Though the concept of non-performing bandmembers was not unprecedented (i.e. lyricist Keith Reid in [[Procol Harum]]), it was considered unusual that a third of Nektar's lineup had no role in performing or writing their music. Throughout their early existence the band's songwriting was credited to all six members on the album sleeves, but BMI records show that the music was written by the four performing members (Albrighton, Freeman, Moore and Howden). Mick Brockett did however co-write the lyrics with "Mo" Moore, and invented or contributed to the original album titles.

The band's debut album, ''[[Journey to the Centre of the Eye]]'' (1971), consisted of a single song running over 40 minutes, with the last 100 seconds of the first side repeated at the beginning of the second side to maintain continuity. It was a [[concept album]], following an astronaut who is given overwhelming knowledge by [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]]s, with sonic textures reminiscent of [[psychedelic rock]]. The follow-up, ''[[A Tab in the Ocean]]'' (1972), drew on more conventional rock and blues influences. Walters had left by the time of their third album, the heavily improvised live-in-the-studio double LP ''[[...Sounds Like This]]'' (1973), though the band would continue to use his art in their shows and album designs for a time. A cult following grew for the band, based largely on word of mouth.

==Success==
Nektar's U.S. release, ''[[Remember the Future]]'' (1973), propelled the band briefly into mass popularity. A concept album revisiting ''Journey to the Centre of the Eye''{{'}}s theme of extraterrestrials granting a human enlightenment, but with a [[blindness|blind]] boy as the protagonist. It demonstrated a much more melodic sound than previous albums and shot into the Top 20 album charts in the U.S.. The follow-up, ''[[Down to Earth (Nektar album)|Down to Earth]]'' (1974), was another concept album (this time with a [[circus]] theme); it also sold well, breaking into the Top 40 album charts and including their only song to chart on the Billboard singles charts, "Astral Man". The next album, ''[[Recycled (album)|Recycled]]'' (1975), was stylistically close to bands like [[Gentle Giant]] and carried on the band's close connection with progressive rock.

Albrighton left the band in December 1976, just prior to the studio sessions for Nektar's first major-label release, ''[[Magic Is a Child]]'' (1977). The remaining members were joined by guitarist/vocalist Dave Nelson at this point. The album was more eclectic, although with shorter songs and fairly straightforward rhythms. Lyrically the album covered a wide range of subjects from [[Norse mythology]] and [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] to more down to earth subjects like [[Rail transport|railroads]] and truck drivers. In 1978 the band dissolved; however in 1979 Albrighton and Freeman reformed the band with bassist [[Carmine Rojas]] and drummer Dave Prater and released a new album, ''[[Man in the Moon (Nektar album)|Man in the Moon]]'' (1980), before the band dissolved once again in 1982.

[[Ian Curtis]] of [[Joy Division]] was a fan of the band and was photographed before he joined the band in a Nektar T shirt.

==Reformation==
Nektar regrouped in 2000 with a line-up consisting of Albrighton, Freeman, and drummer Ray Hardwick; and released a new album titled ''[[The Prodigal Son (Nektar album)|The Prodigal Son]]''. The following year, the band headlined [[NEARfest]] (opposite [[Steve Hackett]]) with the full classic line-up including Mo Moore on bass, Ron Howden on drums and [[Larry Fast]] (who played on [[Recycled (Nektar album)|Recycled]]) again guesting on synthesizers.<ref>{{cite web|title=NEARfest Official Facebook Page|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/nearfest/nearfest-2002/1379311842101617/|work=NEARfest Archives|access-date=10 January 2019}}</ref> In 2003, Moore departed the band and was replaced by new bassist Randy Dembo. Nektar cut one more album, ''[[Evolution (Nektar album)|Evolution]]'', before Freeman was replaced by Tom Hughes. Dembo and Hughes left in August 2006, citing communication problems, money issues, personality issues and trust in the management issues. Dembo was briefly replaced by a returning Carmine Rojas, before the band settled on a line-up that consisted of Albrighton, Howden, guitarist Steve Adams, bassist Desha Dunnahoe, and keyboardist Steve Mattern. However, this line up never appeared live on stage in public.

Later in 2006, the band found new management in Roy Clay to replace The Eclectic Records staff, playing "Prog fests" around the globe on a part-time basis, and occasionally appearing in some of their old haunts in the New Jersey/New York area. Clay was subsequently released from management duties early 2007 after a dispute over financial matters. The band made an official complaint which exposed further fraudulent acts. Clay was ultimately convicted for fraud, lying and forgery, and was jailed for 2 years and 11 months.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://slides.com/jameskaan/roy-clay-music-producer-jailed#/ |title=Music Producer's £170,000 Swindle |last=Naylor |first=Mark |date=18 April 2011 |publisher=[[Grimsby Telegraph]]}}</ref>

In mid-2007, a solo tour was undertaken by Albrighton. A full band tour of Europe (primarily Germany) was scheduled by a European-based promoter, but they had to postpone as extra funds were needed to complete the new album, ''[[Book of Days (Nektar album)|Book of Days]]'', which was not released until the following year, by which time Adams, Dunnahoe, and Mattern had departed the band. ''Book of Days'' featured more of Roye Albrighton's guitar work than previous Nektar albums.<ref>{{cite web|title=27-Apr-2008 interview with Roye Albrighton on Outsight Radio Hours|url=https://archive.org/details/OutsightRadioHoursInterviewsIi|work=Archive.org|access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref>

In late 2007, the band embarked on a tour for which they performed ''Remember the Future'' in its entirety, the line-up now including Klaus Henatsch on keyboards and Peter Pichl on bass. In this formation they toured extensively through Europe in 2008. These concerts resulted in the highly acclaimed live double CD album "Fortyfied", which was released in 2009 under Roye's own "Treacle Music" label. In 2009, the band also played their first gig in the US again, appearing as headliners at the "Rites Of Spring" festival and a week-long tour along the East Coast.

In mid 2011, Lux Vibratus joined the band on bass for the Cleopatra records 'Space Rock Invasion Tour' in the U.S.<ref name=members>{{cite web|title=The Current Band Members |url=http://nektarsmusic.com/nn/band/band_current.asp|website=Nektar: The Official Website|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> By the time the band came to record the [[covers album]] ''A Spoonful of Time'' (2012), bass duties were shared by session musician Jürgen Engler, [[Mr. Big (American band)|Mr. Big]] bassist [[Billy Sheehan]], and [[Yes (band)|Yes]] member [[Billy Sherwood]], who also served as the album's producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nektar-A-Spoonful-Of-Time/release/4108523 |title=Nektar - A Spoonful Of Time (CD, Album) |website=Discogs.com |date=2 November 2012 |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> The Albrighton-Howden-Henatsch-Sherwood line-up recorded and released the album ''Time Machine''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Nektar-Time-Machine/release/5389903 |title=Nektar - Time Machine (Vinyl, LP, Album) |website=Discogs.com |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> A special post-recording show was put together at the Coach House in South Orange County, California. Returning to Nektar in 2013, Lux Vibratus was on bass for the Cruise To The Edge event, followed by The Virada Cultural Festival in São Paulo, Brazil. In June, this line-up went on the road again for a U.S. tour billed as the 'U.K. Legends of Classic Rock'.<ref name=members/><ref>{{Cite web|date=1 December 2016|title=2013 & 2014 Tour Dates - The Nektar Project Forum - Page 1|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201085747/http://www.thenektarproject.com/geewiz/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=164&title=2013-2014-tour-dates|access-date=31 August 2020|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> In January 2014, bassist Tom Fry joined the band for a European tour. On this tour Che Albrighton, Roye's son, made his first appearance as a drummer because Howden had a different engagement. Che had previously worked as tour manager for Nektar on several tours.

On 26 July 2016, Roye Albrighton died after an unspecified illness, at the age of 67.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bravewords.com/news/legendary-nektar-frontman-roye-albrighton-passes |title=Legendary NEKTAR Frontman Roye Albrighton Passes |website=Bravewords.com |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>

After the death of Roye Albrighton, Klaus Henatsch (Keys), Ron Howden (Drums) and Tom Fry (Bass) decided to move on with the production of a new album with On Stage Records, the label they worked with since 2015. First release under this label the Live CD double album ''Live In Bremen''. Also highly regarded and appreciated because it documents the last tour with Roye Albrighton. Later also released as triple vinyl album. For this new beginning of Nektar Alexander Hoffmeister has been asked to follow the footsteps of his idol and friend Roye Albrighton. After an audition in 2017, Klaus Henatsch, Ron Howden and Tom Fry were willing to continue the tradition of Nektar with Alexander Hoffmeister as new front singer and guitar player.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nektarband.com/story.php |title=The Story of NEKTAR |website=Bravewords.com |access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref>

In early 2018, Ron Howden (drums) decided to leave the formation to found his own Nektar contribution in the US and approached Derek "Mo" Moore about joining his Nektar band. When Moore agreed, former members Randy Dembo (bass and 12-string), Mick Brockett (lights, projections and atmosphere), and Ryche Chlanda (guitar and vocals) were soon signed on. To fill the keyboards slot, Kendall Scott, a friend of Chlanda's was brought aboard.

The circumstances of Howden leaving lead to the current state of the band, namely that there are two formations following the name "Nektar". One is based in Germany and operates under the name New Nektar, and one is based in the United States. To create some distinction and distance from old successes, the German formation released their concept album ''Megalomania'' in 2018 using the name "New Nektar". To fill the gap on drums, the German entity engaged Che Albrighton, Roye Albrighton's son, to record the drums for ''Megalomania,'' though when the band played their Megalomania Release Tour in December 2018, he was busy playing with [[Jamie Lawson (musician)|Jamie Lawson]], so Norbert "Panza" Lehmann joined the band. The US line-up assembled a set of never-formally recorded songs from Chlanda's previous time in the band and began rehearsals and recordings for a new album to be titled ''The Other Side.'' That album was released in January 2020 under the name "Nektar".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.regioactive.de/review/2020/01/11/new-nektar-zeigen-im-cafe-central-in-weinheim-zwei-seiten-QFy7ncQSry.php |title=Concert Review of NEKTAR |website=Regioactive.de}}</ref>
