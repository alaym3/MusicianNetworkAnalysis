'''Victor August Herbert''' (February 1, 1859 – May 26, 1924) was an American composer, [[Cello|cellist]] and [[conducting|conductor]] of English and Irish ancestry and German training. Although Herbert enjoyed important careers as a cello soloist and conductor, he is best known for composing many successful [[operetta]]s that premiered on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] from the 1890s to World War I. He was also prominent among the [[Tin Pan Alley]] composers and was later a founder of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP). A prolific composer, Herbert produced two operas, a [[cantata]], 43 operettas, [[incidental music]] to 10 plays, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions and numerous songs, choral compositions and orchestrations of works by other composers, among other music.

In the early 1880s, Herbert began a career as a cellist in [[Vienna]] and [[Stuttgart]], during which he began to compose orchestral music. Herbert and his opera singer wife, Therese Förster, moved to the U.S. in 1886 when both were engaged by the [[Metropolitan Opera]]. In the U.S., Herbert continued his performing career, while also teaching at the [[National Conservatory of Music of America|National Conservatory of Music]], conducting and composing. His most notable instrumental compositions were his Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30 (1894), which entered the standard repertoire,<ref name=Julian>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924183727/http://julianlloydwebber.com/ladn_3_87_her.asp|title=Herbert cello concerto No.2 review|date=September 24, 2010|website=Web.archive.org|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> and his ''Auditorium Festival March'' (1901). He conducted the [[Pittsburgh Symphony]] from 1898 to 1904 and then founded the Victor Herbert Orchestra, which he conducted throughout the rest of his life.

Herbert began to compose operettas in 1894, producing several successes, including ''[[The Serenade]]'' (1897) and ''[[The Fortune Teller (operetta)|The Fortune Teller]]'' (1898). Some of the operettas that he wrote after the turn of the 20th century were even more successful: ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903), ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905), ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906), ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910), ''[[Sweethearts (musical)|Sweethearts]]'' (1913) and ''[[Eileen (musical)|Eileen]]'' (1917). After World War I, with the change of popular musical tastes, Herbert began to compose [[musical theatre|musicals]] and contributed music to other composers' shows. While some of these were well-received, he never again achieved the level of success that he had enjoyed with his most popular operettas.

Herbert initially planned to pursue a career as a medical doctor. Although his stepfather was related by blood to the German royal family, his financial situation was not good by the time Herbert was a teenager. Medical education in Germany was expensive, and so Herbert focused instead on music.<ref name=Early>Mott, Alyce.

[http://www.grovemusic.com "Victor Herbert"], ''Grove Music Online'' ed. L. Macy, accessed February 11, 2009 {{subscription}}</ref>

===Early career and the move to the U.S.===
[[Image:Eduard Strauss concert poster.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Concert poster for Eduard Strauss's orchestra]]
Even before studying with Cossmann, Herbert was engaged professionally as a player in concerts in Stuttgart. His first orchestra position was as a flute and piccolo player, but he soon turned solely to the cello. By the time he was 19, Herbert had received engagements as a soloist with several major German orchestras.<ref name=Early/> He played in the [[orchestra]] of the wealthy Russian Baron Paul von Derwies for a few years and, in 1880, was a soloist for a year in the orchestra of [[Eduard Strauss]] in [[Vienna]]. Herbert joined the court orchestra in Stuttgart in 1881, where he remained for the next five years. There he composed his first pieces of instrumental music, playing the solos in the premieres of his first two large-scale works, the Suite for cello and orchestra, Op.&nbsp;3 (1883) and the Cello Concerto No. 1, Op. 8.<ref name=Grove/> In 1883, Herbert was selected by [[Johannes Brahms]] to play in a [[chamber orchestra]] for the celebration of the life of [[Franz Liszt]], then 72 years old, near Zurich.<ref name=Early/>

In 1885 Herbert became romantically involved with [[Therese Förster]] (1861–1927), a [[soprano]] who had recently joined the court opera for which the court orchestra played. Förster sang several leading roles at the Stuttgart Opera in 1885 through the summer of 1886.  After a year of courtship, the couple married on August 14, 1886. On October 24, 1886, they moved to the United States, as they both had been hired by [[Walter Damrosch]] and [[Anton Seidl]] to join the [[Metropolitan Opera]] in New York City. Herbert was engaged as the opera orchestra's principal cellist, and Förster was engaged to sing principal roles.<ref name=Early/> During the voyage to America, Herbert and his wife became friends with their fellow passenger and future conductor at the Metropolitan Opera, Anton Seidl, and other singers joining the Met.<ref>Herbert, Victor. [https://books.google.com/books?id=qNI5AAAAIAAJ&q=Victor+Herbert#v=snippet&q=Victor%20Herbert&f=false ''Anton Seidl: a memorial by his friends''], ed. Henry Theophilus Finck, C. Scribner's Sons, 1899, pp. 123–25, accessed November 4, 2009</ref>

===Initial musical life in New York City===
Seidl became an important mentor to Herbert and took a particular interest in fostering Herbert's skills as a conductor. Upon arriving in New York, Herbert and Förster became active members of New York's German music community, socializing and networking at cafes such as [[Luchow's]]. At these cafes, Herbert handed out business cards saying, "solo cellist from the Royal Orchestra of his Majesty, the King of Wurtemberg. Instructor in cello, vocal music and harmony."<ref name=Setting>Mott, Alyce. [http://www.vherbert.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=46:setting-the-stage-in-america&catid=28:herbert-biography&Itemid=57 "Setting the Stage in America"], Victor Herbert Renaissance Project website, March 8, 2008, accessed November 9, 2009</ref> Herbert hoped to pick up extra income teaching, since he was earning only $40 to $50 a week as a cellist in the Met's orchestra.

Meanwhile, in her first season at the Met, 1886–87, Förster sang several roles in German, including the title role of the Queen of Sheba in [[Karl Goldmark|Goldmark]]'s ''[[Die Königin von Saba]]'', Elsa in ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', Irene in [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''Rienzi'', the title role in the Met premiere of [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'' and Elizabeth in ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''. She earned praise from critics and audiences alike and was featured on the cover of the ''[[Musical Courier]]'', a major music magazine of the day. The next season, she repeated the role of Elsa but then left the Met and then sang with the German-language [[Bowery Theatre|Thalia Theatre]], again earning good reviews. Although she sang for several more years, her career did not progress.<ref name=Setting/> Nevertheless, happy in New York, Herbert and Förster decided to remain in America after their first season at the Metropolitan Opera and eventually became citizens.<ref>Waters, p. 234</ref>

[[Image:Anton Seidl.png|thumb|[[Anton Seidl]], Herbert's mentor and friend]]
Herbert quickly became prominent in New York City's musical scene, making his first American solo appearance on the cello in a performance of his own Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3, with [[Walter Damrosch]] conducting the [[New York Symphony Orchestra|Symphony Society of New York]] at the Metropolitan Opera House on January 8, 1887. The ''[[New York Herald]]'' said of the event, "[Herbert's] style is infinitely more easy and graceful than that of most cello players".<ref name=Setting/> This warm reception quickly led to more solo engagements that year, including performances of his own ''Berceuse'' and ''Polonais''.  Herbert continued to appear as a cello soloist with major American orchestras into the 1910s. In the fall of 1887, he formed his own 40-piece orchestra, the Majestic Orchestra Internationale, which he conducted and in which he served as cello soloist. Although the orchestra survived for only one season, it performed in several of New York's most important concert halls.<ref name=Setting/> The same year, he founded the [[New York String Quartet]] together with violinists [[Sam Franko]] and [[Henry Boewig]], and violist Ludwig Schenck. The group's first concert was on December 8, 1887, and it continued to give free-admittance concerts for several years at [[Steinway Hall]], earning enthusiastic critical praise.<ref>Waters, pp. 39–40</ref>

During the Summer of 1888, Herbert became Seidl's assistant conductor of the [[New York Philharmonic]]'s ten-week summer concert seasons on the Boardwalk at [[Brighton Beach]], a prestigious post. Seidl's concert seasons made Brighton Beach an important New York musical venue each summer.<ref name=Setting/> Herbert conducted the 80-piece orchestra in lighter works paired with more serious repertoire at summer concerts and festivals over the next few years.<ref name=Grove/> Herbert's association with the New York Philharmonic ended in 1898, after eleven seasons, serving variously as an assistant conductor, guest conductor and solo cellist. In Fall 1888, soprano Emma Juchs hired Herbert to music direct a "concert party" tour of cities and towns in the [[midwest]] that had seen little art music, presenting a quartet of singers in varied programs of songs, operatic scenes and arias to new audiences. The accompaniment was usually pianist Adele Aus de Ohe and Herbert at the cello. The group presented their concerts to wealthy patrons at fashionable private parties and at mostly smaller venues to local audiences, educating them about opera, art songs and contemporary music.<ref name=Setting/>

===Conducting and composing successes===
On December 1, 1888, Seidl programmed Herbert's ''Serenade for String Orchestra, Op. 12'' as part of a concert at Steinway Hall, with the composer conducting.  In January 1889, Herbert and violinist [[Max Bendix]] were the soloists in the American premiere of the challenging ''Double Concerto, Op. 102'' for Violin, Cello and Orchestra by Brahms. Conductor [[Theodore Thomas (conductor)|Theodore Thomas]] then invited Herbert to conduct and perform with him in [[Chicago]]. In 1889, Herbert formed the Metropolitan Trio Club with Bendix and pianist Reinhold L. Herman. The ''Musical Courier'' gave effusive praise to both Herbert's compositions ("refined taste, abundant melodic invention") and his playing: "As a violoncellist, Mr. Herbert ranks with the foremost alive".<ref name=Setting/> Seidl brought Herbert, Förster, Bendix, Juchs, Ohe and [[Lilli Lehmann]], together with a large orchestra and 500-voice chorus, to [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] in May 1889 as part of a big music festival to celebrate the new Exposition Building.

Herbert also played and conducted for the [[Worcester Music Festival, Massachusetts|Worcester Music Festival]], where he returned repeatedly through the 1890s. In the autumn of 1889, Herbert also joined the faculty of the [[National Conservatory of Music of America|National Conservatory of Music]], where he taught cello and music composition for several years. In 1890, he was appointed the conductor of the Boston Festival Orchestra, serving there in seasons through 1893, in addition to all of his conducting commitments elsewhere.<ref>Waters, p. 57</ref> In 1891, Herbert premiered an ambitious [[cantata]], ''The Captive'', for solo voices, chorus and full orchestra. His ''Irish Rhapsody'' (1892), written for the Gaelic Society of New York enjoyed a brief but intense period of popularity.<ref name=Setting/>

He became director of the 22nd Regimental Band of the [[New York National Guard]] in 1894, succeeding its founder, [[Patrick Gilmore]] and Gilmore's unsuccessful immediate successor [[David Wallis Reeves]].  Herbert toured widely with the 22nd Regimental Band through 1900, performing both his own band compositions and works from the orchestral repertory that he transcribed for the band.<ref>Gould, pp. 66–83</ref> Beginning in 1894, when he began composing operettas, Herbert's band marches were sometimes derived from material from the operettas. Throughout his career, Herbert was well liked by orchestra players for his modesty and unpretentiousness. Herbert continued to compose orchestral music, writing one of his finest works, the Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30, which premiered in 1894.<ref name=Grove/>

In 1898, Herbert became the principal conductor of the [[Pittsburgh Symphony]], a position he held until 1904. Under his leadership, the orchestra became a major American ensemble and was favorably compared by music critics with ensembles like the New York Philharmonic and [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]]. The orchestra toured to several major cities during Herbert's years as conductor, notably premiering Herbert's ''[[Auditorium Festival March]]'' for the celebration of the twelfth anniversary of Chicago's [[Auditorium Theatre]] in 1901. After a disagreement with the management of the Pittsburgh Symphony in 1904, Herbert resigned, founding the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He conducted their programs of light orchestral music paired with more serious repertoire (as he had done earlier with Anton Seidl's Brighton Beach orchestra concerts) at summer resorts and on tours for most of his remaining years.<ref name=Grove/> His orchestra made many acoustical recordings for both [[Edison Records]], from 1909 to 1911, and the [[Victor Talking Machine Company]], from 1911 to 1923. Herbert was also a cello soloist in several Victor recordings as well.<ref>Waters, p. 405</ref>

===Activist for the legal rights of composers===
In the early years of the twentieth century, Herbert championed the right of composers to profit from their works. In 1909, he testified before the [[United States Congress]], influencing the formation and development of the [[Copyright Act of 1909]].  This law helped to secure the rights of composers to charge royalties on the sales of sound recordings.<ref name=Grove/>

[[Image:Prince Ananias.jpg|right|thumb|A photo from the original 1894 production of ''[[Prince Ananias]]'', Herbert's first operetta.]]
Herbert led a group of composers and publishers in founding the [[American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers]] (ASCAP) on February 13, 1914,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=vQcEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 ''Billboard''], February 16, 1974, p. 10</ref> becoming its vice-president and director until his death in 1924. The organization has historically worked to protect the rights of songwriters and music publishers and continues to do this work today. In 1917, Herbert won a landmark lawsuit before the [[United States Supreme Court]] that gave composers, through ASCAP, a right to charge performance fees for the public performance of their music.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091124102553/http://songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C290|title=Songwriters Hall of Fame - Victor Herbert Exhibit Home|date=November 24, 2009|website=Web.archive.org|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> ASCAP commissioned a [[Bust of Victor Herbert|bust in Herbert's honor]] in New York City's Central Park, erected in 1927.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/central-park/monuments/707|title=Central Park Monuments - Victor Herbert : NYC Parks|website=Nycgovparks.org|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref>

===Operetta, opera and musical theatre===
In 1894 Herbert composed his first [[operetta]], ''[[Prince Ananias]]'', for a popular troupe known as [[The Bostonians]].  The piece was well received, and Herbert soon composed three more operettas for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], ''[[The Wizard of the Nile]]'' (1895), ''[[The Serenade]]'' (1897), which enjoyed international success, and ''[[The Fortune Teller (operetta)|The Fortune Teller]]'' (1898), starring [[Alice Nielsen]]. Although these achieved popularity, Herbert did not produce any more stage works for several years, focusing on his work with the Pittsburgh Symphony until 1904. Just before leaving that orchestra, he returned to Broadway with his first major hit, ''[[Babes in Toyland (operetta)|Babes in Toyland]]'' (1903). Two more successes followed, ''[[Mlle. Modiste]]'' (1905) and ''[[The Red Mill]]'' (1906), which solidified Herbert as one of the best-known American composers. He was elected to the [[National Institute of Arts and Letters]] in 1908.<ref>Waters, p. 315</ref>

[[File:SweetheartsVH1.jpg|left|thumb|Sheet music for the title song from ''Sweethearts'']]
Although Herbert's reputation lies with his operettas, he also composed two [[grand opera]]s. He searched for several years for a libretto that appealed to him, finally finding one by Joseph D. Redding called ''[[Natoma (opera)|Natoma]]'' that concerned a historical story set in California. He composed the work from 1909 to 1910, and it premiered in [[Philadelphia]] on February 25, 1911, with soprano [[Mary Garden]] in the title role and the young Irish [[tenor]] [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]] in his American operatic debut. Herbert's score was well received, and the opera was repeated as part of the company's repertory during the next three seasons. It also enjoyed performances in New York City, making its debut there on February 28, 1911. Herbert's other opera, ''[[Madeleine (opera)|Madeleine]]'', was a much lighter work in one act.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://urresearch.rochester.edu/institutionalPublicationPublicView.action?institutionalItemId=2044&versionNumber=1|title=Madeleine : a lyric opera in one act / adapted from the French of Decourcelles & Thibaut by Grant Stewart; music by Victor Herbert.|first1=Victor|last1=Herbert|first2=Adrien|last2=Decourcelle|first3=Lambert|last3=Thiboust|first4=Grant|last4=Stewart|date=September 10, 1914|access-date=September 10, 2021|website=Urresearch.rochester.edu}}</ref> On January 24, 1914, it had its premiere at the Metropolitan Opera, but it was not revived beyond that season.<ref>Waters, p. 399</ref>

During this period, Herbert continued to compose operettas, producing two of his most successful works, ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'' (1910) and ''[[Sweethearts (musical)|Sweethearts]]'' (1913). He also became progressively more involved with Irish-American organizations: in 1908 he joined the [[Friendly Sons of St. Patrick]] (becoming president in 1916), the oldest Irish association in New York, and in 1911 he became a member of the [[American Irish Historical Society]].<ref name=Casey/> In early 1916, he became the founding president of the [[Friends of Irish Freedom]] and became active in the cause of [[Irish nationalism]].<ref name=Casey/> Another operetta, ''[[Eileen (musical)|Eileen]]'' (1917, originally entitled ''Hearts of Erin''), was the fulfillment of Herbert's desire to compose an Irish-themed operetta and a tribute to his grandfather's novel ''Rory O'More''.<ref name=Nationalism/> The piece is set during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798]] and contains a rich score; it debuted in time to mark the first anniversary of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland.<ref name=Nationalism/> This was the end of Herbert's greatest period of producing full scores for operettas.<ref name=Grove/> In late 1916 Herbert also orchestrated "Soldiers of Erin",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://irishsheetmusicarchives.com/Sheet-Music-Catalog/Soldiers-Of-Erin-IF-SL-02-476.htm|title=Soldiers Of Erin|website=Irishsheetmusicarchives.com|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> an English language version of what would later be adopted as the [[Amhrán na bhFiann|Irish national anthem]]; it was widely performed in the US from early 1917.<ref name="Nationalism" />

[[File:Victor Herbert.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Herbert at the height of his success]]
By World War I, with the birth of [[jazz]], [[ragtime]] and new dance styles like the [[foxtrot]] and [[tango (ballroom)|tango]], Herbert reluctantly switched to writing [[musical theatre|musical comedies]]. These featured less elaborate ensembles and simpler songs for less classically trained singers than the European-style operettas that had dominated his earlier career. Herbert, during the last years of his career, was frequently asked to compose ballet music for the elaborate production numbers in Broadway [[revue]]s and the shows of [[Irving Berlin]] and [[Jerome Kern]], among others. He was also a contributor to the ''[[Ziegfeld Follies]]'' every year from 1917 to 1924.<ref>Gould, p. 567</ref><ref>Waters, p. 591</ref>

==Death and legacy==
A healthy man throughout his life, Herbert died suddenly of a heart attack at the age of 65 on May 26, 1924, shortly after his final show, ''[[The Dream Girl (operetta)|The Dream Girl]]'', began its pre-Broadway run in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref>Gould, p. 521</ref> He was survived by his wife and two children, Ella Victoria Herbert Bartlett and Clifford Victor Herbert.<ref>Tubb, Benjamin Robert.

Herbert and his music are celebrated in the 1939 film ''[[The Great Victor Herbert]]'', where he was portrayed by [[Walter Connolly]] and which also featured [[Mary Martin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103010532/http://www.doctormacro1.info/Movie%20Summaries/G/Great%20Victor%20Herbert%2C%20The.htm|title=Great Victor Herbert, The|website=Web.archive.org|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> He was also portrayed by [[Paul Maxey]] in the 1946 film ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''. Many of Herbert's own works were made into films, and his music has been used in numerous films and television shows.

Herbert was a prolific composer, producing two operas, one [[cantata]], 43 operettas, [[incidental music]] to 10 stage productions, 31 compositions for orchestra, nine band compositions, nine cello compositions, five violin compositions with piano or orchestra, 22 piano compositions, one flute and clarinet duet with orchestra, numerous songs, including many for the ''Ziegfeld Follies'', and other works, 12 choral compositions, and numerous orchestrations of works by other composers, among other compositions.<ref name=Early/> He also composed ''[[The Fall of a Nation]]'' (1916), one of the first original orchestral scores for a full-length film. The score was thought to be lost, but it turned up in the film-music collection of the [[Library of Congress]]. It was given a recording in 1987.<ref name=Grove/>

As a composer, Herbert is chiefly remembered for his operettas. Of his instrumental works, only a few remained consistently within the concert repertoire after Herbert's death. However, some of his forgotten works have enjoyed a resurgence of popularity within the last couple decades.<ref>Gould, p. 530</ref>

Herbert's early shows toured widely, usually including a Broadway run to further publicize the tour. As Broadway increasingly became essential to commercial theatrical success, Herbert designed his shows to appeal specifically to New York sensibilities.<ref name=Grove/> Although consistently praised for his music, many of Herbert's operettas were criticized by theatre critics for their weak librettos and conventional lyrics.<ref>Waters, p. 574</ref> By the mid-20th century, revivals of Herbert's works were relatively rare. His shows were revived occasionally on Broadway until 1947, but not thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ibdb.com/broadway-cast-staff/victor-herbert-8949|title=Victor Herbert – Broadway Cast & Staff |website=IBDdb.com|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> In the 1970s and 1980s, however, the operettas began to be revived more frequently, albeit often with heavily rewritten librettos, by companies like the [[Light Opera of Manhattan]] and [[Ohio Light Opera]], and revivals continue today.<ref>See, e.g., [http://www.lightoperaofnewyork.org/about-us Light Opera of New York website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222003859/http://www.lightoperaofnewyork.org/about-us |date=February 22, 2011}}, noting productions of Herbert operettas in 2010</ref>

===Herbert's style===
American musical theatre composers of the late nineteenth century tended to imitate either Viennese operetta or the works of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]. Many American theatre companies, such as The Bostonians, were established for the purpose of performing Gilbert and Sullivan's operas, such as ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'', and adaptations of [[Karl Millöcker]]'s operettas, such as ''[[Der Bettelstudent]]'', or [[Franz von Suppé]]'s ''[[Boccaccio (operetta)|Boccaccio]]'', all of which became popular in America. Herbert tailored his operettas to be performed by companies that performed these works.<ref name=Grove/>  His background made him intimately familiar with Viennese operetta. Indeed, the most characteristic Herbert song was the waltz, and many of his waltzes became highly popular in spite of their high musical demands.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

[[File:Alice Neilsen's production of Victor Herbert's The Fortune Teller.jpg|left|thumb|300px|''The Fortune Teller'' drum corps]]
Herbert is also known for his "variation" songs, which consist either of a series of refrains displaying different styles, or of several variations of the same melody. For example, "[[Serenade]]s of All Nations" from ''The Fortune Teller'' demonstrates serenades from colourful national traditions, sung and danced by a [[ballerina]]. "The Song of the Poet" from ''Babes in Toyland'' provides variations on the lullaby "[[Rock-a-bye Baby]]" by presenting it first as a brassy march, then in Neapolitan style, and finally as a cakewalk. The best of Herbert's operetta music is challenging, calling for trained singers. He often wrote his operettas with a particular singer in mind. During his career he had occasion to work with three great prima donnas: [[Alice Nielsen]], [[Fritzi Scheff]], and [[Emma Trentini]]. For them, he wrote leading parts in ''The Fortune Teller'' and ''The Singing Girl'' (Nielsen), ''Babette'', ''Mlle. Modiste'', ''The Prima Donna'' and ''Mlle Rosita'' (Scheff), and ''Naughty Marietta'' (Trentini). He would also write shows for popular comedians of the day or noted producers. Some of these were spectacular successes (''[[The Red Mill]]'', written for the comedy team of [[David C. Montgomery]] and [[Fred Stone]], was Herbert's most financially successful show.<ref>Waters, p. 302</ref>), while others were dismal failures (''[[When Sweet Sixteen]]'', written for [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]], who pulled out of the production, which lasted only twelve performances on Broadway.<ref>Waters, p. 366</ref>).

Although Herbert had not been exposed to Gilbert and Sullivan before his arrival in the U.S. in 1886, their popularity led him to adopt some of their musical and dramatic sensibilities. An example of this is the quintet "Cleopatra's Wedding Day" from ''[[The Wizard of the Nile]]''.<ref>Gould, p. 238</ref>  One of his early successes, ''[[The Serenade]]'', borrows many of its situations from ''[[Ruddigore]]'', ''[[Iolanthe]]'' and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''. The work's librettist, [[Harry B. Smith]], went on to steal more Gilbertian ideas for future operettas with Herbert, who often would complement these ideas with music reminiscent of Sullivan. ''The Singing Girl'', co-written by Smith and [[Stanislaus Stange]], recalls ''The Mikado'', and includes the plot element of a law against kissing without a licence.<ref>Gould, p. 302</ref>

[[File:RedmillVH1.jpg|right|thumb|Sheet music from ''The Red Mill'']]
Herbert tended to use a slightly larger orchestra than Sullivan did in his comic operas, mostly through use of more types of percussion and occasionally by adding a harp. He generally wrote his own orchestrations, which were admired by music critics and other composers. In revivals of his works, however, new orchestrations have substituted saxophones and brass for strings. For many years, the only recording available of a Herbert show using his original orchestrations was one of ''[[Naughty Marietta (operetta)|Naughty Marietta]]'', produced by the Smithsonian in 1981.<ref>Smithsonian LP label N 026</ref> Only recently have more recordings of his operettas appeared with the original orchestrations intact. These include ''Naughty Marietta'', ''Mlle. Modiste'', ''Eileen'', ''Sweethearts'' and ''The Red Mill'' by [[Ohio Light Opera]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119043927/http://www.ohiolightopera.org/giftshop.php|title=The Ohio Light Opera - Gift Shop|date=January 19, 2012|website=Web.archive.org|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> and ''The Fortune Teller'' by The Comic Opera Guild, which also has recorded numerous Herbert operettas live in concert with two-piano accompaniment.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicoperaguild.org/PAGES/RECORDINGS.html|title=The Comic Opera Guild Recordings|website=Comicoperaguild.org|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref>

Like Sullivan, Herbert also frequently evokes and imitates music from distant places in his operettas. He uses elements of [[Music of Spain|Spanish music]] in ''The Serenade'', [[Music of Italy|Italian music]] in ''Naughty Marietta'', [[Music of Austria|Austrian music]] in ''The Singing Girl'' and [[Eastern music]] in ''The Wizard of the Nile'', ''The Idol's Eye'', ''The Tattooed Man'' and other works set in places like Egypt and India. ''The Fortune Teller'' includes an energetic Hungarian [[csárdás]]. He also frequently interpolated Irish-style songs into his operettas which, with the exception of those in ''Eileen'', rarely advanced the plot.<ref>Purdy, pp. 41–49</ref>

By World War I, musical tastes were shifting in America, and Herbert was forced to compose in a simpler musical style. Many of his later works, such as ''The Velvet Lady'' and ''Angel Face'' (both 1919), imitated popular new song-types like the [[foxtrot]], [[ragtime]] and the [[tango music|tango]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=8831|title=The Velvet Lady – Broadway Musical – Original |website=IBDb.com|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=6751|title=Angel Face – Broadway Musical – Original |website=IBDb.com|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> Even in some of his earlier works, such as ''The Red Mill'' (1906), Herbert was already adopting elements that would later become associated with musical comedy in America. His collaboration on ''The Century Girl'' (1916) with [[Irving Berlin]] displayed this simpler style. Although these later shows introduced some memorable numbers, they did not enjoy the enduring popularity of his most popular operettas. The most successful work of his later career was ''[[Orange Blossoms (musical)|Orange Blossoms]]'' (1921),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=9113|title=Orange Blossoms – Broadway Musical – Original |website=IBDb.com|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/orangeblossomsco00herb|title=Orange blossoms : a comedy with music in three acts|first1=Victor|last1=Herbert|first2=George Gard|last2=De Sylva|date=September 10, 1922|publisher=New York : Harms|access-date=September 10, 2021|website=Archive.org}}</ref> which included the popular waltz song, "A Kiss in the Dark".<ref>Waters, p. 501</ref>

===Operas===
[[Image:Mary Garden in Victor Herbert's Natoma.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mary Garden]] in the title role of ''[[Natoma (opera)|Natoma]]'']]
Although his success had been in light music, like Sullivan, Herbert aspired to compose serious operas. Approached by [[Oscar Hammerstein I]] to write a [[grand opera]], Herbert jumped at the chance. Hammerstein announced, in the April 13, 1907 issue of ''[[Musical America]]'', a $1,000 prize for the best libretto submitted, fueling public enthusiasm and high expectations.  Joseph Redding's libretto for ''[[Natoma (opera)|Natoma]]'', set in 1820s [[California]], is a love story between an American naval officer and a Native American princess. The cast included such distinguished singers as [[John McCormack (tenor)|John McCormack]] and [[Mary Garden]], but the 1911 premiere in Philadelphia was only a moderate success. Critics praised the music, including its effective melodies and [[leitmotif]]s set off by orchestral counterpoint. They complained, however, about the libretto and the casting of foreign singers in what was supposed to be an "American opera".<ref name=Grove/><ref>Gould, p. 416</ref>

''[[Madeleine (opera)|Madeleine]]'', his only other opera, is based on a French play and tells the equable little story of an operatic prima donna whose friends and acquaintances, one by one, decline her invitation to dine with her on New Years Day. The work is in one act and premiered in 1914 in a double bill with [[Enrico Caruso]] in the leading [[tenor]] role in ''[[Pagliacci]]''. The opera featured [[Frances Alda]] in the title role. It failed to make an impression and received only six performances. Its conversational style is complemented by orchestral motivic commentary. Just before the work opened, Herbert added "A Perfect Day" at Alda's request. Although not a success, because of Herbert's popularity, [[G. Schirmer]] took the unprecedented step of publishing the work in full score.<ref name=Grove/>

===Instrumental music===
After Herbert's death, little of his instrumental music continued to be performed, but within the last couple of decades it has begun to enjoy revivals in concert and recordings. His ''Cello Concerto No. 2 in E minor, Op. 30'', is an exception to this.  First performed in 1894, it was received enthusiastically at its premiere and shows the influence of [[Franz Liszt]]. [[Antonín Dvořák]], a colleague of Herbert's at the National Conservatory, was inspired to compose his [[Cello Concerto (Dvořák)|Cello Concerto in B minor]], Op. 104, after hearing its premiere.<ref name=Grove/><ref>Purdy, p. 115</ref> The concerto has been recorded by cellists such as [[Yo-Yo Ma]] (with [[Kurt Masur]] and the New York Philharmonic), [[Lynn Harrell]] (with Sir [[Neville Marriner]] and the [[Academy of St Martin in the Fields]]), [[Julian Lloyd Webber]] (with Sir [[Charles Mackerras]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]]),<ref name=Julian/><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.julianlloydwebber.com/herbert.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908064047/http://www.julianlloydwebber.com/herbert.asp|url-status=dead|title=Cello Concerto no. 2 review|archive-date=September 8, 2008|access-date=September 10, 2021}}</ref> and an early rare recording by [[Bernard Greenhouse]] (with [[Max Schönherr]] and the [[Vienna Symphony Orchestra]]).<ref name=American>American Recording Society ARS-111, 1953</ref>

[[Image:MariettaVH2.jpg|right|180px]]
More recently, two of Herbert's earlier compositions for cello and orchestra have regained a place in the concert repertory. The Suite for Cello and Orchestra, Op. 3 (1884), his earliest known composition despite its designation as Op. 3, has been performed by several ensembles in recent years. The work foreshadows the light music of Herbert's later compositions. Another work that has been revived is his Cello Concerto No. 1, which was first performed by the composer in Stuttgart shortly before he came to the U.S. For many years, the work was unpublished and apparently unperformed, surviving only in manuscript. It was recorded for the first time in 1986 and has since been published. The composition is admired for achieving an effective balance between its virtuosic elements and its lyricism.<ref name=Grove/>

Of his large-scale orchestral works, Herbert's [[tone poem]] ''Hero and Leander'' (1901) is his most important. Composed for the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra while Herbert was their conductor, the work displays an affinity with both Wagner and Liszt.  Another important work that Herbert wrote for the PSO is ''Columbus'', Op. 35, a four-movement programmatic suite. The first and final movements of the suite were composed in 1893 as part of a theatrical spectacle intended for the Colombian Exposition in Chicago. However, Herbert never completed that project, and the central two movements were not composed until 1902. The PSO premiered the work in 1903, and it was the last large-scale symphonic work that Herbert composed.<ref>Waters, p. 237</ref>

Herbert also composed a considerable body of smaller-scale works, often writing music for his own performance on the cello or producing individual songs for the Victor Herbert Orchestra. He published some of his [[dance music]] compositions under the pseudonym '''Noble MacClure'''.<ref>Purdy, p. 211</ref> During the last decade of his life, he composed a number of overtures for feature films, although ''The Fall of a Nation'' was his only complete film score.<ref name=Grove/> On February 12, 1924, Herbert was one of the featured composers at New York's [[Aeolian Hall (New York)|Aeolian Hall]], in an evening entitled ''An Experiment in Modern Music'' that included the world premiere of [[George Gershwin]]'s ''[[Rhapsody in Blue]]'' by the [[Paul Whiteman]] orchestra.<ref>Wood, p. 81</ref><ref>Jablonski, Edward.
