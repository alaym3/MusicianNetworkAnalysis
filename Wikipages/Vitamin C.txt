===Significance===
Vitamin C is an essential [[nutrient]] for certain animals including humans. The term ''vitamin C'' encompasses several [[vitamer]]s that have vitamin C activity in animals. Ascorbate salts such as sodium ascorbate and calcium ascorbate are used in some dietary supplements. These release ascorbate upon digestion. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body, since the forms interconvert according to [[pH]]. Oxidized forms of the molecule such as [[dehydroascorbic acid]] are converted back to ascorbic acid by reducing agents.<ref name="DRItext" /><ref name=PKIN2020VitC>{{cite book |title = Present Knowledge in Nutrition, Eleventh Edition |chapter = Vitamin C | veditors = Marriott MP, Birt DF, Stallings VA, Yates AA |publisher = Academic Press (Elsevier) |year=2020 |location = London, United Kingdom |pages = 155–70 |isbn=978-0-323-66162-1}}</ref>

Vitamin C functions as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in many [[enzyme|enzymatic]] reactions in animals (including humans) that mediate a variety of essential biological functions, including [[wound healing]] and [[collagen]] synthesis. In humans, vitamin C deficiency leads to impaired [[collagen]] synthesis, contributing to the more severe symptoms of [[scurvy]].<ref name="DRItext" /> Another biochemical role of vitamin C is to act as an [[antioxidant]] (a [[reducing agent]]) by donating electrons to various enzymatic and non-enzymatic reactions.<ref name="DRItext" /> Doing so converts vitamin C to an oxidized state - either as semidehydroascorbic acid or [[dehydroascorbic acid]]. These compounds can be restored to a reduced state by [[glutathione]] and [[NADPH]]-dependent [[enzyme|enzymatic]] mechanisms.<ref name="pmid8144521">{{cite journal | vauthors = Meister A | title = Glutathione-ascorbic acid antioxidant system in animals | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 269 | issue = 13 | pages = 9397–400 | date = April 1994 | pmid = 8144521 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(17)36891-6 | url = http://www.jbc.org/content/269/13/9397.full.pdf+html | url-status = live | doi-access = free | df = mdy-all | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150811212232/http://www.jbc.org/content/269/13/9397.full.pdf+html | archive-date = August 11, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="isbn1-4377-0959-1">{{cite book |veditors=Caudill MA, Rogers M |title=Biochemical, Physiological, and Molecular Aspects of Human Nutrition |edition=3 |publisher=Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2012 |pages=627–654 |isbn=978-1-4377-0959-9 |chapter=Vitamin C |vauthors=Michels A, Frei B }}</ref><ref name="Gropper_2005">{{cite book |vauthors=Gropper SS, Smith JL, Grodd JL |title=Advanced nutrition and human metabolism |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA |year=2005 |pages= 260–275 |isbn=978-0-534-55986-1 }}</ref>

In plants, vitamin C is a [[substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] for [[ascorbate peroxidase]].

===Deficiency===

Vitamin C blood [[Serum (blood)|serum]] levels are considered saturated at levels {{nobreak|>{{hsp}}65 μmol/L}} (1.1&nbsp;mg/dL), achieved by consuming amounts which are at, or above, the [[Reference Daily Intake|Recommended Dietary Allowance]], while adequate levels are defined as {{nobreak|≥{{hsp}}50 μmol/L}}.

[[Scurvy]] is a disease resulting from a deficiency of vitamin C. Without this vitamin, [[collagen]] made by the body is too unstable to perform its function and several other [[enzyme]]s in the body do not operate correctly.<ref name=lpi2018 /> Scurvy is characterized by [[Hyperkeratosis|spots]] on and [[Ecchymosis|bleeding]] under the skin, spongy gums, 'corkscrew' hair growth, and poor wound healing. The skin lesions are most abundant on the thighs and legs, and a person with the ailment looks pale, feels depressed, and is partially immobilized. In advanced scurvy there are open, [[suppuration|suppurating wounds]], loss of [[Tooth|teeth]], [[Bone|bone abnormalities]] and, eventually, death.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Magiorkinis E, Beloukas A, Diamantis A | title = Scurvy: past, present and future. | journal = The European Journal of Internal Medicine | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 147–52 | date = Apr 2011 | pmid = 21402244 | doi = 10.1016/j.ejim.2010.10.006}}</ref>

Notable human dietary studies of experimentally induced scurvy were conducted on [[conscientious objector]]s during World War II in Britain and on Iowa state prisoners in the late 1960s to the 1980s. Men in the prison study developed the first signs of scurvy about four weeks after starting the vitamin C-free diet, whereas in the earlier British study, six to eight months were required, possibly due to the pre-loading of this group with a 70&nbsp;mg/day supplement for six weeks before the scorbutic diet was fed.

===Cancer===
There are two approaches to the question of whether vitamin C has an effect on cancer. First, within the normal range of dietary intake without additional dietary supplementation, are people who consume more vitamin C at lower risk for developing cancer, and if so, does an orally consumed supplement have the same benefit? Second, for people diagnosed with cancer, will large amounts of ascorbic acid administered intravenously treat the cancer, reduce the adverse effects of other treatments, and so prolong survival and improve quality of life?

In 2000 the North American [[Dietary Reference Intake]] chapter on vitamin C updated the [[Recommended Dietary Allowance]] (RDA) to 90 milligrams per day for adult men and 75&nbsp;mg/day for adult women, and set a [[Tolerable upper intake level]] (UL) for adults of 2,000&nbsp;mg/day.<ref name="DRItext" /> The table shows RDAs for the United States and Canada for children, and for pregnant and lactating women.<ref name="DRItext" /> For the European Union, the EFSA set higher recommendations for adults, and also for children: 20&nbsp;mg/day for ages 1–3, 30&nbsp;mg/day for ages 4–6, 45&nbsp;mg/day for ages 7–10, 70&nbsp;mg/day for ages 11–14, 100&nbsp;mg/day for males ages 15–17, 90&nbsp;mg/day for females ages 15–17. For pregnancy 100&nbsp;mg/day; for lactation 155&nbsp;mg/day.<ref name=EFSA-Recommended /> India, on the other hand, has set recommendations much lower: 40&nbsp;mg/day for ages 1 through adult, 60&nbsp;mg/day for pregnancy, and 80&nbsp;mg/day for lactation.<ref name="NIN" /> Clearly, there is not consensus among countries.

Cigarette smokers and people exposed to secondhand smoke have lower serum vitamin C levels than nonsmokers.<ref name=Schleicher2009/> The thinking is that inhalation of smoke causes oxidative damage, depleting this antioxidant vitamin.<ref name="DRItext" /> The U.S. Institute of Medicine estimated that smokers need 35&nbsp;mg more vitamin C per day than nonsmokers, but did not formally establish a higher RDA for smokers.<ref name="DRItext" /> One meta-analysis showed an inverse relationship between vitamin C intake and lung cancer, although it concluded that more research is needed to confirm this observation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Luo J, Shen L, Zheng D | title = Association between vitamin C intake and lung cancer: a dose-response meta-analysis | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 4 | pages = 6161 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25145261 | pmc = 5381428 | doi = 10.1038/srep06161 | bibcode = 2014NatSR...4E6161L }}</ref>

The U.S. National Center for Health Statistics conducts biannual National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. Some results are reported as What We Eat In America. The 2013-2014 survey reported that for adults ages 20 years and older, men consumed on average 83.3&nbsp;mg/d and women 75.1&nbsp;mg/d. This means that half the women and more than half the men are not consuming the RDA for vitamin C.<ref>[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf "TABLE 1: Nutrient Intakes from Food and Beverages"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224042515/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_1_NIN_GEN_13.pdf |date=February 24, 2017 }} What We Eat In America, NHANES 2012-2014</ref> The same survey stated that about 30% of adults reported they consumed a vitamin C dietary supplement or a multi-vitamin/mineral supplement that included vitamin C, and that for these people total consumption was between 300 and 400&nbsp;mg/d.<ref>[https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_37_SUP_GEN_13.pdf "TABLE 37: Nutrient Intakes from Dietary Supplements"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171006162231/https://www.ars.usda.gov/ARSUserFiles/80400530/pdf/1314/Table_37_SUP_GEN_13.pdf |date=October 6, 2017 }} What We Eat In America, NHANES 2012-2014</ref>

====Tolerable upper intake level====
In 2000 the Institute of Medicine of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences set a [[Tolerable upper intake level]] (UL) for adults of 2,000&nbsp;mg/day. The amount was chosen because human trials had reported diarrhea and other gastrointestinal disturbances at intakes of greater than 3,000&nbsp;mg/day. This was the Lowest-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level (LOAEL), meaning that other adverse effects were observed at higher intakes. ULs are progressively lower for younger and younger children.<ref name="DRItext" /> The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) in 2006 also pointed out the disturbances at that dose level, but reached the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for vitamin C,<ref>{{cite web|year=2006|title=Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals|url=http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316225123/http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf|archive-date=March 16, 2016|publisher=European Food Safety Authority}}</ref> as did the Japan National Institute of Health and Nutrition in 2010.<ref name="JapanDRI2015" />

===Food labeling===
For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV).

====Animal sources====

Animal-sourced foods do not provide much vitamin C, and what there is, is largely destroyed by the heat of cooking. For example, raw chicken liver contains 17.9&nbsp;mg/100 g, but fried, the content is reduced to 2.7&nbsp;mg/100 g. Chicken eggs contain no vitamin C, raw or cooked.<ref name="USDA-NDL"/> Vitamin C is present in [[Breastfeeding#Benefits|human breast milk]] at 5.0&nbsp;mg/100 g and 6.1&nbsp;mg/100 g in one tested sample of infant formula, but cow's milk contains only 1.0&nbsp;mg/ 100 g.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.saanendoah.com/compare.html |title= Comparing Milk: Human, Cow, Goat & Commercial Infant Formula |access-date=February 28, 2007 |date=January 8, 2007 | vauthors = Clark S |publisher=[[Washington State University]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129024619/http://www.saanendoah.com/compare.html |archive-date=January 29, 2007}}</ref>

===Food preparation===
Vitamin C [[chemical decomposition|chemically decomposes]] under certain conditions, many of which may occur during the cooking of food. Vitamin C concentrations in various food substances decrease with time in proportion to the temperature at which they are stored.<ref name="pmid7621082">{{cite journal | vauthors = Roig MG, Rivera ZS, Kennedy JF | title = A model study on rate of degradation of L-ascorbic acid during processing using home-produced juice concentrates | journal = International Journal of Food Sciences and Nutrition | volume = 46 | issue = 2 | pages = 107–15 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7621082 | doi = 10.3109/09637489509012538 }}</ref> Cooking can reduce the vitamin C content of vegetables by around 60%, possibly due to increased enzymatic destruction.<ref name="pmid14801407">{{cite journal | vauthors = Allen MA, Burgess SG | title = The losses of ascorbic acid during the large-scale cooking of green vegetables by different methods | journal = The British Journal of Nutrition | volume = 4 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 95–100 | year = 1950 | pmid = 14801407 | doi = 10.1079/BJN19500024 | doi-access = free }}</ref> Longer cooking times may add to this effect.<ref name="Oxford">{{cite web |url=http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/AS/ascorbic_acid.html |title=Safety (MSDS) data for ascorbic acid |access-date=February 21, 2007 |date=October 9, 2005 |publisher=[[Oxford University]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070209221915/http://physchem.ox.ac.uk/MSDS/AS/ascorbic_acid.html |archive-date=February 9, 2007  }}</ref>

Another cause of vitamin{{nbsp}}C loss from food is [[leaching (chemical science)|leaching]], which transfers vitamin{{nbsp}}C to the cooking water, which is decanted and not consumed. [[Broccoli]] may retain vitamin{{nbsp}}C during cooking or storage more than most vegetables.<ref name=Combs>{{cite book | vauthors = Combs GF |title=The Vitamins, Fundamental Aspects in Nutrition and Health |edition=2nd |place=San Diego, CA |publisher=Academic Press |year=2001 |pages=245–272 |isbn=978-0-12-183492-0}}</ref>

===Supplements===
Vitamin C dietary supplements are available as tablets, capsules, drink mix packets, in multi-vitamin/mineral formulations, in antioxidant formulations, and as crystalline powder.<ref name=AHFS2016 /> Vitamin C is also added to some fruit juices and juice drinks. Tablet and capsule content ranges from 25&nbsp;mg to 1500&nbsp;mg per serving.

=== Pharmacodynamics ===
{{Expand section|the content specified on the talk page|small=no|talksection=Talk:Vitamin&nbsp;C#Pharmacodynamics|date=December 2018}}
Vitamin C – specifically, in the form of ''ascorbate'' – performs numerous physiological functions in the human body by serving as an [[enzyme]] [[substrate (biochemistry)|substrate]] and/or [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] and an [[electron donor]]. These functions include the synthesis of [[collagen]], [[carnitine]], and [[neurotransmitter]]s; the synthesis and [[catabolism]] of [[tyrosine]]; and the metabolism of [[microsome]].<ref name="Gropper_2005" /> During biosynthesis, ascorbate acts as a reducing agent, donating electrons and preventing oxidation to keep iron and copper atoms in their reduced states.

Vitamin C functions as a cofactor for the following [[enzyme]]s:

* Three groups of enzymes ([[prolyl-3-hydroxylase]]s, [[P4HA1|prolyl-4-hydroxylase]]s, and [[lysyl hydroxylase]]s) that are required for the [[hydroxylation]] of [[proline]] and [[lysine]] in the synthesis of [[collagen]].<ref name="pmid7574488">{{cite journal | vauthors = Prockop DJ, Kivirikko KI | title = Collagens: molecular biology, diseases, and potentials for therapy | journal = Annual Review of Biochemistry | volume = 64 | pages = 403–434 | year = 1995 | pmid = 7574488 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.bi.64.070195.002155 }}</ref><ref name="pmid1720597">{{cite journal | vauthors = Peterkofsky B | title = Ascorbate requirement for hydroxylation and secretion of procollagen: relationship to inhibition of collagen synthesis in scurvy | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 54 | issue = 6 Suppl | pages = 1135S–1140S | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1720597 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/54.6.1135s}}</ref><ref name="pmid3008623">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kivirikko KI, Myllylä R | title = Post-translational processing of procollagens | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 460 | issue = 1| pages = 187–201 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3008623 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1985.tb51167.x | bibcode = 1985NYASA.460..187K | s2cid = 36467519 }}</ref> These reactions add [[hydroxide|hydroxyl groups]] to the amino acids [[proline]] or [[lysine]] in the collagen molecule via [[prolyl hydroxylase]] and [[lysyl hydroxylase]], both requiring vitamin C as a [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]].

=== Pharmacokinetics ===

==== Absorption ====
From the U.S. National Institutes of Health: [In humans] "Approximately 70%–90% of vitamin C is absorbed at moderate intakes of 30–180 mg/day. However, at doses above 1,000 mg/day, absorption falls to less than 50%."<ref name=NIH2016 /> It is transported through the intestine via both glucose-sensitive and glucose-insensitive mechanisms, so the presence of large quantities of sugar in the intestine can slow absorption.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilson JX | title = Regulation of vitamin C transport | journal = Annual Review of Nutrition | volume = 25 | pages = 105–125 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16011461 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.nutr.25.050304.092647 }}</ref>

Ascorbic acid is absorbed in the body by both active transport and simple diffusion. Sodium-Dependent Active Transport—Sodium-Ascorbate Co-Transporters (SVCTs) and Hexose transporters (GLUTs)—are the two transporter proteins required for active absorption.

====Excretion====
Excretion can be as ascorbic acid, via urine. In humans, during times of low dietary intake, vitamin C is reabsorbed by the kidneys rather than excreted. Only when plasma concentrations are 1.4&nbsp;mg/dL or higher does re-absorption decline and the excess amounts pass freely into the urine.

{{Main|Chemistry of ascorbic acid}}

The name "vitamin C" always refers to the [[Enantiomer|{{sm|l}}-enantiomer]] of ascorbic acid and its [[Redox|oxidized]] forms, such as dehydroascorbate (DHA). Therefore, unless written otherwise, "ascorbate" and "ascorbic acid" refer in the nutritional literature to {{sm|l}}-ascorbate and {{sm|l}}-ascorbic acid respectively. Ascorbic acid is a [[weak acid|weak]] [[sugar acid]] structurally related to [[glucose]]. In biological systems, ascorbic acid can be found only at low [[pH]], but in solutions above pH 5 is predominantly found in the [[ionized]] form, ascorbate. All of these molecules have vitamin C activity and thus are used synonymously with vitamin C, unless otherwise specified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

Numerous analytical methods have been developed for ascorbic acid detection. For example, vitamin C content of a food sample such as fruit juice can be calculated by measuring the volume of the sample required to decolorize a solution of [[dichlorophenolindophenol]] (DCPIP) and then calibrating the results by comparison with a known concentration of vitamin C.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |title=Testing Foods for Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) |publisher=British Nutrition Foundation |date=2004 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151123101705/http://www.foodafactoflife.org.uk/attachments/ff2caf4a-75e5-4aa129132873.pdf |archive-date=November 23, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |title=Measuring the Vitamin C content of foods and fruit juices |publisher=Nuffield Foundation |date=November 24, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150721181046/http://www.nuffieldfoundation.org/practical-biology/measuring-vitamin-c-content-foods-and-fruit-juices |archive-date=July 21, 2015 }}</ref>

== Testing ==
Simple tests are available to measure the levels of vitamin C in [[urine]] and [[serous fluid|serum]].<ref name=Carr2016 /><ref name=Schleicher2009 /> These better reflect recent dietary intake rather than total body content.<ref name="DRItext" /> It has been observed that while serum concentrations follow a [[circadian rhythm]] or reflect short-term dietary influence, content within cells or tissues is more stable and can give a better view of the availability of ascorbate within the entire organism.

==Biosynthesis==

The biosynthesis of ascorbic acid in [[vertebrates]] starts with the formation of UDP-glucuronic acid. UDP-glucuronic acid is formed when UDP-glucose undergoes two oxidations catalyzed by the enzyme UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase. UDP-glucose 6-dehydrogenase uses the co-factor NAD<sup>+</sup> as the electron acceptor. The transferase UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase removes a [[Uridine monophosphate|UMP]] and [[glucuronokinase]], with the cofactor ADP, removes the final phosphate leading to [[glucuronic acid|{{sm|d}}-glucuronic acid]]. The aldehyde group of this compound is reduced to a primary alcohol using the enzyme [[glucuronate reductase]] and the cofactor NADPH, yielding {{sm|l}}-gulonic acid. This is followed by lactone formation{{Em dash}}utilizing the hydrolase [[gluconolactonase]]{{Em dash}}between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4. {{sm|l}}-Gulonolactone then reacts with oxygen, catalyzed by the enzyme [[L-gulonolactone oxidase]] (which is nonfunctional in humans and other [[Haplorrhini]] primates; see [[Pseudogene#Unitary pseudogenes|Unitary pseudogenes]]) and the cofactor FAD+. This reaction produces 2-oxogulonolactone (2-keto-gulonolactone), which spontaneously undergoes [[enolization]] to form ascorbic acid.<ref name=Seanet>Figure 2 in [https://www.seanet.com/~alexs/ascorbate/197x/stone-i-orthomol_psych-1972-v1-n2-3-p82.htm The Natural History of Ascorbic Acid in the Evolution of the Mammals and Primates and Its Significance for Present Day Man] Stone I.

There are many different biosynthesis pathways for ascorbic acid in plants. Most of these pathways are derived from products found in glycolysis and other pathways. For example, one pathway goes through the plant cell wall polymers.<ref name="valpuesta"/> The plant ascorbic acid biosynthesis pathway most principal seems to be {{sm|l}}-galactose. {{sm|l}}-Galactose reacts with the enzyme  {{sm|l}}-galactose dehydrogenase, whereby the lactone ring opens and forms again but with lactone between the carbonyl on C1 and hydroxyl group on C4, resulting in {{sm|l}}-galactonolactone.<ref name="West Sussex 2009"/>  {{sm|l}}-Galactonolactone then reacts with the mitochondrial flavoenzyme [[Galactonolactone dehydrogenase|{{sm|l}}-galactonolactone dehydrogenase]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Leferink NG, van den Berg WA, van Berkel WJ | title = l-Galactono-gamma-lactone dehydrogenase from Arabidopsis thaliana, a flavoprotein involved in vitamin C biosynthesis | journal = The FEBS Journal | volume = 275 | issue = 4 | pages = 713–26 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18190525 | doi = 10.1111/j.1742-4658.2007.06233.x | s2cid = 25096297 | doi-access = free }}</ref> to produce ascorbic acid.<ref name="West Sussex 2009"/> {{sm|l}}-Ascorbic acid has a negative feedback on {{sm|l}}-galactose dehydrogenase in spinach.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mieda T, Yabuta Y, Rapolu M, Motoki T, Takeda T, Yoshimura K, Ishikawa T, Shigeoka S | display-authors = 6 | title = Feedback inhibition of spinach L-galactose dehydrogenase by L-ascorbate | journal = Plant & Cell Physiology | volume = 45 | issue = 9 | pages = 1271–9 | date = September 2004 | pmid = 15509850 | doi = 10.1093/pcp/pch152 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

===Evolution===
Ascorbic acid is a common enzymatic [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactor]] in mammals used in the synthesis of [[collagen]], as well as a powerful [[reducing agent]] capable of rapidly scavenging a number of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS). Given that ascorbate has these important functions, it is surprising that the ability to synthesize this molecule has not always been conserved. In fact, anthropoid primates, ''[[Guinea pig|Cavia porcellus]]'' (guinea pigs), [[teleost]] fishes, most bats, and some [[passerine]] birds have all independently lost the ability to internally synthesize Vitamin C in either the kidney or the liver.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Lachapelle MY, Drouin G | title = Inactivation dates of the human and guinea pig vitamin C genes | journal = Genetica | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–207 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 21140195 | doi = 10.1007/s10709-010-9537-x | s2cid = 7747147 }}</ref><ref name="pmid22294879"/> In all of the cases where genomic analysis was done on an ascorbic acid [[Auxotrophy|auxotroph]], the origin of the change was found to be a result of loss-of-function mutations in the gene that codes for L-Gulono-γ-lactone oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the last step of the ascorbic acid pathway outlined above.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yang H | s2cid = 14393449 | title = Conserved or lost: molecular evolution of the key gene GULO in vertebrate vitamin C biosynthesis | journal = Biochemical Genetics | volume = 51 | issue = 5–6 | pages = 413–25 | date = June 2013 | pmid = 23404229 | doi = 10.1007/s10528-013-9574-0 }}</ref> One explanation for the repeated loss of the ability to synthesize vitamin C is that it was the result of [[genetic drift]]; assuming that the diet was rich in vitamin{{nbsp}}C, natural selection would not act to preserve it.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang ZD, Frankish A, Hunt T, Harrow J, Gerstein M | title = Identification and analysis of unitary pseudogenes: historic and contemporary gene losses in humans and other primates | journal = Genome Biology | volume = 11 | issue = 3 | pages = R26 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20210993 | pmc = 2864566 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2010-11-3-r26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koshizaka T, Nishikimi M, Ozawa T, Yagi K | title = Isolation and sequence analysis of a complementary DNA encoding rat liver L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase, a key enzyme for L-ascorbic acid biosynthesis | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 263 | issue = 4 | pages = 1619–21 | date = February 1988 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9258(19)77923-X | pmid = 3338984 | doi-access = free }}</ref>

In the case of the simians, it is thought that the loss of the ability to make vitamin C may have occurred much farther back in evolutionary history than the emergence of humans or even apes, since it evidently occurred soon after the appearance of the first primates, yet sometime after the split of early primates into the two major suborders [[Haplorrhini]] (which cannot make vitamin C) and its sister suborder of non-tarsier prosimians, the [[Strepsirrhini]] ("wet-nosed" primates), which retained the ability to make vitamin C.<ref name="pmid3113259">{{cite journal | vauthors = Pollock JI, Mullin RJ | title = Vitamin C biosynthesis in prosimians: evidence for the anthropoid affinity of Tarsius | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 73 | issue = 1 | pages = 65–70 | date=1987 | pmid = 3113259 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.1330730106 }}</ref> According to molecular clock dating, these two suborder primate branches parted ways about 63 to 60 million years ago.<ref name="pmid15085543">{{cite journal | vauthors = Poux C, Douzery EJ | title = Primate phylogeny, evolutionary rate variations, and divergence times: a contribution from the nuclear gene IRBP | journal = American Journal of Physical Anthropology | volume = 124 | issue = 1 | pages = 01–16 | date=2004 | pmid = 15085543 | doi = 10.1002/ajpa.10322 }}</ref> Approximately three to five million years later (58 million years ago), only a short time afterward from an evolutionary perspective, the infraorder [[Tarsiiformes]], whose only remaining family is that of the tarsier ([[Tarsiidae]]), branched off from the other haplorrhines.<ref name="pmid9668008">{{cite journal | vauthors = Goodman M, Porter CA, Czelusniak J, Page SL, Schneider H, Shoshani J, Gunnell G, Groves CP | title = Toward a phylogenetic classification of Primates based on DNA evidence complemented by fossil evidence | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 9 | issue = 3 | pages = 585–598 | date=1998 | pmid = 9668008 | doi = 10.1006/mpev.1998.0495 }}</ref><ref name="Porter_1997">{{cite journal |vauthors=Porter CA, Page SL, Czelusniak J, Schneider H, Schneider MP, Sampaio I, Goodman M |s2cid=1851788 |title=Phylogeny and Evolution of Selected Primates as Determined by Sequences of the ε-Globin Locus and 5′ Flanking Regions |journal=International Journal of Primatology |date= 1997 |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=261–295 |doi=10.1023/A:1026328804319 |hdl=2027.42/44561 |hdl-access=free }}</ref> Since tarsiers also cannot make vitamin C, this implies the mutation had already occurred, and thus must have occurred between these two marker points (63 to 58 million years ago).<ref name="pmid3113259" />

It has also been noted that the loss of the ability to synthesize ascorbate strikingly parallels the inability to break down [[uric acid]], also a characteristic of primates.

==Industrial production==
Vitamin C is produced from [[glucose]] by two main routes. The [[Reichstein process]], developed in the 1930s, uses a single pre-fermentation followed by a purely chemical route. The modern two-step [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] process, originally developed in [[China]] in the 1960s, uses additional fermentation to replace part of the later chemical stages. The Reichstein process and the modern two-step fermentation processes use [[sorbitol]] as the starting material and convert it to [[sorbose]] using fermentation. The modern two-step fermentation process then converts sorbose to 2-keto-l-gulonic acid (KGA) through another fermentation step, avoiding an extra intermediate. 
Both processes yield approximately 60% vitamin C from the glucose feed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2001/fulltext/456a4.2.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20120119194657/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/rep_pub/reports/2001/fulltext/456a4.2.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 19, 2012 |title=The production of vitamin C |access-date=February 20, 2007 |year=2001 |publisher=Competition Commission }}</ref>

The first attempt to give scientific basis for the cause of this disease was by a ship's surgeon in the [[Royal Navy]], [[James Lind]].

From 1928 to 1932, [[Albert Szent-Györgyi]] and Joseph L. Svirbely's Hungarian team, and [[Charles Glen King]]'s American team, identified the anti-scorbutic factor.

In 2008, researchers at the [[University of Montpellier]] discovered that in humans and other primates the [[red blood cell]]s have evolved a mechanism to more efficiently utilize the vitamin C present in the body by recycling oxidized {{sm|l}}-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) back into ascorbic acid for reuse by the body. The mechanism was not found to be present in mammals that synthesize their own vitamin C.<ref name=pmid18358815 />

===Large doses===
{{Further|Vitamin C megadosage|Intravenous ascorbic acid}}
Vitamin C megadosage is a term describing the consumption or injection of vitamin C in doses comparable to or higher than the amounts produced by the livers of mammals which are able to synthesize vitamin C. The theory behind this, although not the actual term, was described in 1970 in an article by [[Linus Pauling]]. Briefly, his position was that for optimal health, humans should be consuming at least 2,300&nbsp;mg/day to compensate for the inability to synthesize vitamin C. The recommendation also fell into the consumption range for gorillas - a non-synthesizing near-relative to humans.<ref name=pmid5275366>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pauling L | title = Evolution and the need for ascorbic acid | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 67 | issue = 4 | pages = 1643–8 | date = December 1970 | pmid = 5275366 | pmc = 283405 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.67.4.1643 | bibcode = 1970PNAS...67.1643P | doi-access = free }}</ref> A second argument for high intake is that serum ascorbic acid concentrations increase as intake increases until it plateaus at about 190 to 200 micromoles per liter (µmol/L) once consumption exceeds 1,250 milligrams.<ref name=Mandl2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Mandl J, Szarka A, Bánhegyi G | title = Vitamin C: update on physiology and pharmacology | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 157 | issue = 7 | pages = 1097–110 | date = August 2009 | pmid = 19508394 | pmc = 2743829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1476-5381.2009.00282.x }}</ref> As noted, government recommendations are a range of 40 to 110&nbsp;mg/day and normal plasma is approximately 50 µmol/L, so 'normal' is about 25% of what can be achieved when oral consumption is in the proposed megadose range.

Pauling popularized the concept of high dose vitamin C as prevention and treatment of the common cold in 1970. A few years later he proposed that vitamin C would prevent cardiovascular disease, and that 10 grams/day, initially (10 days) administered intravenously and thereafter orally, would cure late-stage cancer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron E, Pauling L | title = Supplemental ascorbate in the supportive treatment of cancer: Prolongation of survival times in terminal human cancer | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 73 | issue = 10 | pages = 3685–9 | date = October 1976 | pmid = 1068480 | pmc = 431183 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.73.10.3685| bibcode = 1976PNAS...73.3685C | doi-access = free }}</ref> Mega-dosing with ascorbic acid has other champions, among them chemist [[Irwin Stone]] and the controversial [[Matthias Rath]] and [[Patrick Holford]], who both have been accused of making unsubstantiated treatment claims for treating cancer and [[HIV]] infection.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}}

The mega-dosing theory is to a large degree discredited. Modest benefits are demonstrated for the common cold. Benefits are not superior when supplement intakes of more than 1,000&nbsp;mg/day are compared to intakes between 200 and 1,000&nbsp;mg/day, and so not limited to the mega-dose range.<ref name="LPI">{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/vitamins/vitamin-C#common-cold-treatment|title=Vitamin C: Common cold|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University|access-date=May 3, 2017|location=Corvallis, OR|date=January 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name="Hemila2009">{{Cite book | doi=10.1007/978-3-7643-9912-2_13|chapter = Vitamins and minerals|title = Commond Cold| pages=275–307|year = 2009| vauthors = Hemilä H |hdl = 10138/228060| isbn=978-3-7643-9894-1}}</ref> The theory that large amounts of intravenous ascorbic acid can be used to treat late-stage cancer is - some forty years after Pauling's seminal paper - still considered unproven and still in need of high quality research.<ref name=Wil2014 /><ref name=Jacobs2015 /> However, a lack of conclusive evidence has not stopped individual physicians from prescribing intravenous ascorbic acid to thousands of people with cancer.<ref name=Jacobs2015 />
