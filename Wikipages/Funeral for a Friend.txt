'''Funeral for a Friend''' are a Welsh [[post-hardcore]] band from [[Bridgend, Wales|Bridgend]], formed in 2001 and currently consists of Matthew Davies-Kreye (lead vocals), Kris Coombs-Roberts (lead guitar, backing vocals), Gavin Burrough (guitars, backing vocals), Darran Smith (guitars), Richard Boucher (bass), and Ryan Richards (drums, screamed vocals).

Funeral for a Friend's popularity rose in the United Kingdom with the release of their debut album, ''[[Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation]]'' (2003). Achieving both a [[gold certification]] and three top-twenty singles in their home country, ''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'' is often acclaimed as one of the landmark emo records of the 2000s. ''[[Hours (Funeral for a Friend album)|Hours]]'' (2005) featured a similar musical style to their debut, but also featured more melodic sensibilities, and ''[[Tales Don't Tell Themselves]]'' (2007) showed an evolution in Funeral for a Friend's musical style from that which defined their debut, as the group began to diverge from their use of [[screaming (music)|screaming]] vocals and [[post-hardcore]]-influenced guitars, favoring a more melodic rock influence. These albums achieved gold and silver sales certificates respectively in the UK.

Funeral for a Friend self-released their fourth album, ''[[Memory and Humanity]]'' (2008) through their short-lived record label ''Join Us'', the album arguably being their most eclectic to date. Following this the band tied themselves to other independent labels for ''[[Welcome Home Armageddon]]'' (2011)  ''[[Conduit (album)|Conduit]]'' (2013), and ''[[Chapter and Verse (Funeral for a Friend album)|Chapter and Verse]]'' (2015), which showed the band returning to the more metal and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced the style of their earlier work. In September 2015, they announced their break-up and final tour in 2016. On 21 May 2016, they played their last performance to a sold-out [[The Forum, London|Forum]] in [[London]].

In October 2019 Funeral for a Friend reunited as a live band, initially for three benefit shows – two in [[Cardiff]] at the Cardiff University Student Union followed by one in [[London]] at Shepherd's Bush Empire. Following a planned performance at the canceled 2020 [[Download Festival]], they announced a headline UK tour for April 2021 playing songs from their first three albums.

{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center|quote=because when we started out we didn't think we'd reach the level we've reached. It was basically just something to call the band, as we figured we'd just play a couple of shows and then that would be it and even then it isn't that important. A band makes a name, a name doesn't make a band. So no, there's not really anything more to it than the song.|source=drummer Ryan Richards in an interview in 2007<ref name="rockfreaks 1"/>|align=left|width=33%}}
When Michael Davies, one of January Thirst's original vocalists, quit in December 2001, Matthew Evans (vocals) and Johnny Phillips (drums) invited Matt Davies (later Davies-Kreye) to try out for the vacated singer position. Soon afterward, the band reformed as Funeral for a Friend; the name is derived from a song by [[Planes Mistaken for Stars]], one of Davies' favourite bands at the time.<ref name="leedsmusic 1">{{cite web|url=http://www.leedsmusicscene.net/article/2338/|title=Funeral for a Friend Interview 2004|first=John|last=Harvey|publisher=leedsmusicscene|date=8 February 2004|access-date=12 November 2011|archive-date=7 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707064439/http://www.leedsmusicscene.net/article/2338/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the start of the New Year they parted ways with second guitarist Kerry Roberts (Kris Coombs-Roberts's brother) and found a suitable replacement in Darran Smith (ex-Tripcage). The band recorded four tracks at Mighty Atom Studios for a proposed self-financed EP with another Welsh band ''From This Moment On''. Upon hearing the tracks, [[Mighty Atom Records]] approached the band and offered a two-album deal, resulting in their debut [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Between Order and Model]]'' (2002). Before the EP's release, Andi Morris (bass) quit, with Phillips and Evans also leaving. The band then recruited Gareth Davies (later Ellis-Davies) on bass and Ryan Richards on drums. Matt Davies became the band's only primary vocalist, with Gareth Davies performing backing melodies and Richards taking over Evans' screaming role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}

In 2003, Funeral for a Friend recorded their second EP, ''[[Four Ways to Scream Your Name]]'', produced and mixed by [[Colin Richardson]]. In mid-2003, the band secured their first ''[[Kerrang!]]'' award, winning the award for "Best UK Newcomer", beating [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]], who won in all other nominated categories. Funeral for a Friend's win was largely attributed to their fervent fan base, as the awards winner was decided by public vote online at the official ''Kerrang!'' Web site. In August 2003, Funeral for a Friend opened the Concrete Jungle stage at the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]].

''[[Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation]]'', produced and mixed by Colin Richardson, was released to critical acclaim in the UK. The album did not see a concurrent release in the US (eventually released there on 13 July 2004); instead, a seven-track "mini-album", entitled ''[[Seven Ways to Scream Your Name]]'', was released, and featured songs from the band's ''Between Order & Model'' and ''Four Ways to Scream Your Name'' EPs plus Juneau B Side "The Getaway Plan". In the United Kingdom the album received a [[Gold certification]] a year after its release on 29 October 2004,<ref name="bpi">{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/search.aspx |title=BPI > Certified Awards Search |publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] |access-date=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924015932/http://www.bpi.co.uk/certifiedawards/Search.aspx |archive-date=24 September 2009}}</ref> which was achieved with a sales figure of over [[British Phonographic Industry#Certifications|100,000]].<ref name="leedsmusic 1"/>

''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'' saw three [[UK Singles Chart|top-twenty singles]] including "[[Juneau (song)|Juneau]]" (#19), "She Drove Me to Daytime Television" (#20) and "Escape Artists Never Die" (#19).<ref name="FFAF UK Charts">{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/funeral%20for%20a%20friend/|title=Funeral FOr A Friend Artist Official Charts|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=13 November 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313154357/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/funeral%20for%20a%20friend/|archive-date=13 March 2013}}</ref> Funeral for a Friend toured extensively to promote ''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'', including a series of European dates in which they opened for [[Iron Maiden]].<ref name="allmusic page"/> This was met with a mixed reception, as their style and fan base bore little resemblance to the heavy metal background of Iron Maiden.<ref name="leedsmusic 1"/> Also in 2004 Funeral for a Friend supported [[Linkin Park]] throughout America and headlined the second stage of the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals line-ups#2004|Reading and Leeds Festivals]].<ref name="contact-history"/>

Produced by [[Terry Date]], the album was recorded in two [[Seattle]] studios owned by the [[grunge]] band [[Pearl Jam]] and featured unusual methods of recording, for example Matt Davies' vocals were recorded whilst in a moving car and on a crowded Seattle street, for the song "Drive". Just two weeks after its release the album was certified a Silver over 60,000 sales<ref name="contact-history"/> and was awarded a Gold for over 100,000 sales on 23 December 2005.<ref name="bpi"/> In August of the same year, the band won a Kerrang!

Funeral for a Friend performed several low-profile shows in Wales, including [[Bangor University]] and [[Bridgend]] Recreation Centre, prior to the release of ''Hours''. In the United States, they played alongside bands such as [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]], [[Saosin]], [[Hawthorne Heights]] and [[Thrice]] on the Maurice Stage of the 2005 Vans [[Warped Tour]].<ref name="MTV-2005"/> The band headlined the British leg of Taste of Chaos across November with support from [[The Used]], [[Killswitch Engage]], [[Rise Against]] and [[Story of the Year]].<ref name="contact-history"/> Funeral for a Friend released the third and last single from Hours, "[[History (Funeral for a Friend song)|History]]", which music video depicts the events of the [[UK miners' strike (1984–1985)|miner strikes of the mid-1980s]] in South Wales.<ref name="contact-history"/>

Funeral For a Friend closed the promotional activity for ''Hours'' in the Summer of 2006, with a series of UK shows rescheduled from February. Most of the original dates had been cancelled because Matt Davies had suffered from a bout of laryngitis. Several other shows were scheduled in the UK to complement these rescheduled dates, and the tour culminated in a slot below headliners [[Guns N' Roses]] at the [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park]]. The rest of 2006 was spent writing and recording the band's third album.

====''Tales Don't Tell Themselves''====

A selection of intimate shows to promote the album were played on 12, 13 and 14 April 2007 in intimate coastal venues in the south of England. Only 200 tickets were available for each show and these had to be applied for via an e-mail sent to members of the FFAF mailing list. Names were then picked out of a hat and the selected people were offered the opportunity to buy a pair of tickets to the gig, exclusive T-shirts were given to anyone paying using PayPal mobile. On 8 May 2007 the band released ''Tales Don't Tell Themselves'' in its entirety for fans to preview via their MySpace page. This album is the first on which Matt plays guitar. On 10 May 2007 the band played another intimate gig for [[Kerrang! 105.2]] at the [[Wolverhampton]] Civic Hall Bar, in which they played "Walk Away" for the very first time. This is one of the tracks which Matt plays guitar on live, alongside "Raise The Sail" and "The Sweetest Wave", which were debuted on the full tour in May 2007. The album was their highest charting yet, reaching Number 3 in the UK Album Charts.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

"As some of you may know, Gareth has been living in America for the past couple of years, and recently got married. Ultimately, the strain of travelling between continents has taken its toll and Gareth made the decision that it would be in the best interests of himself, his family and Funeral to leave the band.

====''Chapter and Verse'' and breakup====
On 28 September 2014, Funeral for a Friend debuted the lead single from their forthcoming album ''Chapter and Verse'', titled "You've Got a Bad Case of the Religions" on the Rock Show on BBC Radio 1. The band then announced the album's release date of 19 January 2015 as well as a UK/European Tour in support of the album. ''Chapter and Verse'' was recorded in just under two weeks, at The Ranch, Southampton; the record was produced by Lewis Johns. They also announced that Pat Lundy had left the band to focus on his new band [[Modestep]], and that Goodtime Boys drummer Casey McHale would be their live/touring drummer, but they weren't looking for a replacement full-time drummer. Prior to the album's release, music videos were released for both "1%" and "Pencil Pusher". In June, they released ''Hours - Live at Islington Academy'', a live DVD of their show at O2 Academy Islington in April 2014 where they played ''Hours'' in full. The DVD also came with a CD or vinyl record of the show. Also around this time, they recorded a cover of "I Can Climb Mountains" by [[Hell Is For Heroes (band)|Hell Is For Heroes]] for ''Worship and Tributes'', a compilation CD included with Rock Sound magazine's 200th issue, which ended up being the band's final recording. They were the only band who recorded a cover for the compilation who had one of their own songs covered on the same compilation, with Pop Punk band [[Neck Deep]] covering "Juneau".

On 14 September 2015, Funeral for a Friend announced their breakup and the 'Last Chance to Dance' final tour across Australia, Germany and the UK, which spanned from February to April 2016; they played two subsequent nights on each stop of the tour, performing ''Hours'' and ''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'' in their entirety (alongside other songs) on the first and second night respectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=Last Chance to Dance: The Final Tour|url=https://www.facebook.com/funeralforafriend/photos/a.414032154375.191238.6174379375/10153528603284376|author=Funeral for a Friend on [[Facebook]]|date=14 September 2015|access-date=14 September 2015|quote=When we started this band the only hope and aspirations we had was to write music that we loved, play some shows and maybe make a record... we've surpassed that in so many ways, achieving three gold records along the way.

In late February, the band announced the London shows originally scheduled for 15 and 16 April at Shepherd's Bush Empire would instead take place on 20 and 21 May 2016 at the O2 Forum in Kentish Town due to structural issues at the original venue which caused many gigs to be cancelled/moved to other dates. Due to Shai Hulud being unable to make the rearranged dates, [[Raging Speedhorn]] and [[Creeper (band)|Creeper]] played as the main support bands on 20 and 21 May respectively. Their final performance was on 21 May.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Their earlier EPs and their debut album ''Casually Dressed & Deep in Conversation'' were considered their heaviest work for some time, as their subsequent material used less aggressive vocals and instrumentation; however, recent years have seen a resurgence of such elements and a higher number of 'heavy' songs.
