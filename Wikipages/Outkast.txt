'''Outkast''' (sometimes written as '''OutKast''') were an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo formed in 1992 in [[East Point, Georgia]], consisting of [[Atlanta]]-based rappers [[Big Boi|Antwan "Big Boi" Patton]] and [[André 3000|Andre "3000" Benjamin]] (formerly known as Dre).<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Widely recognized for their intricate lyricism, memorable melodies and positive messages,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/OutKast|website=Britannica|id=1016736|title=OutKast}}</ref> Outkast is often regarded as one of the greatest and most influential hip hop acts of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@SNOBHop/the-10-greatest-hip-hop-duos-of-all-time-4bb1253727c3|title=The 10 Greatest Hip-Hop Duos of All time|date=Nov 5, 2017|website=Medium|publisher=SNOBHOP|access-date=Oct 26, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=Jan 2, 2018|title=Outkast's Impact on the Hip Hop Landscape|url=https://www.thenextwavechicago.com/2018/01/outkasts-impact-on-the-hip-hop-landscape/|access-date=Oct 26, 2020|website=The Next Wave Chicago}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=Nov 12, 2015|title=The 10 Best Rappers of All Time|url=http://www.billboard.com/photos/6723017/the-10-best-rappers-of-all-time|access-date=Oct 26, 2020|website=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://acclaimmag.com/music/outkast-changed-rap-game/|title=How André 3000 changed the rap game|last=Houlihan|first=Finn|website=Acclaim Magazine|date=May 27, 2015|access-date=Oct 26, 2020}}</ref> The duo achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success from the mid-1990s to the early 2000s, helping to popularize [[Southern hip hop]]<ref name="ALLMUSIC">[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p111701/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic Biography]</ref> while experimenting with diverse genres such as [[funk]], [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]], [[jazz]], and [[techno]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=Iain|title=Rebels Wit Attitude: Subversive Rock Humorists|date=October 2008|publisher=Soft Skull Press|page=252|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GYRCWazrOdIC&rdid=book-GYRCWazrOdIC&rdot=1&source=gbs_atb&pcampaignid=books_booksearch_atb|access-date=5 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|title=Speakerboxxx/The Love Below|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r651638|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2003|access-date=April 20, 2008}}</ref>

Patton and Benjamin formed the group as high school students in 1992. Outkast released their debut album ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'' in 1994, which gained popularity after the single "[[Player's Ball]]" reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Songs|Hot Rap Tracks]] chart. With successive releases including ''[[ATLiens]]'' (1996) and ''[[Aquemini]]'' (1998), the duo further developed their sound, experimenting with a variety of styles and achieving commercial success. In 2000, Outkast released the critically acclaimed ''[[Stankonia]]'', which included the singles "[[Bombs Over Baghdad|B.O.B.]]" and "[[Ms. Jackson]]"

In September 2003, the duo released the [[double album]] ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', which featured the number one singles "[[The Way You Move]]" and "[[Hey Ya!]]." The album won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] and was certified [[RIAA certification|Diamond]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. Outkast next released [[Idlewild (OutKast album)|the soundtrack]] for the 2006 musical film ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', which they also starred in. In 2007,  the duo went on hiatus and both members have since pursued solo careers. In 2014, Outkast reunited to celebrate their 20th anniversary by performing at more than 40 festivals worldwide, beginning at the [[Coachella Festival]] in April.<ref>[http://www.stereogum.com/1623152/coachella-2014-lineup/news/ Coachella 2014 Lineup]. Stereogum (January 8, 2014). Retrieved on 2014-05-28.</ref>

The duo is one of the most successful hip hop groups of all time, having received six [[Grammy Awards]]. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked them No. 7 on its list of the 20 Greatest Duos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-12-17|title=20 Greatest Duos of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/20-greatest-duos-of-all-time-16272/|access-date=2020-09-05|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> Between [[Outkast discography|six studio albums]] and a [[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast|greatest hits]] release, Outkast has sold over 25 million records.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Meanwhile, they have garnered widespread critical acclaim, with publications such as ''Rolling Stone'' and [[Pitchfork Media]] listing albums such as ''Aquemini'' and ''Stankonia'' among the best of their era.

==History==
===1992–1995: Formation and debut===
[[File:Lenox Square.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Big Boi and Andre 3000 met as teenagers at Atlanta's [[Lenox Square]] shopping center (pictured).]]
Patton and Benjamin met in 1992 at the [[Lenox Square]] shopping mall when they were both sixteen years old.<ref name="Melody">{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/oct/22/entertainment/ca-40125|title=Melody Makers of Hip-Hop|last=Guzman|first=Isaac|work=Los Angeles Times|date=October 22, 2000|access-date=January 20, 2012}}</ref> The two lived in the [[East Point, Georgia|East Point]] section of [[Atlanta]] and attended Tri-Cities High School.<ref name="Melody"/><ref>{{cite web|last1=Pauley|first1=Jared|title=Outkast}}</ref> During school, Patton and Benjamin participated in [[rap battle]]s in the cafeteria.<ref name="Melody"/> Patton parents were divorced and he was living with his father. Meanwhile, Benjamin's had to move with his four brothers and six sisters from Savannah to Atlanta. Patton and Benjamin eventually teamed up and were pursued by [[Organized Noize]], a group of local producers who would later make hits for the R&B girl group [[TLC (music)|TLC]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> The duo initially wanted to be called "2 Shades Deep" or "The Misfits", but because those names were already taken they later decided to use "Outkast" based on finding "outcast" as a [[synonym]] for "misfit" in a dictionary.<ref name="notable bio">{{cite encyclopedia|title=OutKast Biography|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Li-Ou/OutKast.html|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography|year=2006|access-date=April 20, 2008}}</ref> Outkast, [[Organized Noize]], and schoolmates [[Goodie Mob]] formed the nucleus of the [[Dungeon Family]] organization.

Outkast signed to L.A. And Babyface imprint prior to graduation<ref>{{cite web|title=Outkast|publisher=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> which would later become [[LaFace Records]] in 1992, becoming the label's first hip hop act and making their first appearance on the [[remix]] of labelmate [[TLC (music)|TLC]]'s "What About Your Friends". During the [[holiday season]] of 1993, they released their first [[Single (music)|single]], "[[Player's Ball]]". The song's [[funk music|funky]] style, much of it accomplished with live instrumentation, was a hit with audiences. It hit number-one on the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Tracks]] chart.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> "Player's Ball" also topped the R&B charts for six weeks.<ref>{{cite web|title=Outkast- Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik|publisher=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref>

Their debut album,  ''[[Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik]]'', was issued on April 26, 1994. This initial effort is credited with laying the foundation for southern hip hop and is considered a classic by many. Every track on Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik was produced by [[Organized Noize]] and featured other members of [[Dungeon Family|the Dungeon Family]].  Follow-up singles included the title track and "Git Up Git Out", a politically charged collaboration with [[Goodie Mob]] that was later sampled by [[Macy Gray]] for her 1999 hit "Do Something." On this early material, both Big Boi and André 3000 contrast lyrical content reflecting the lifestyles of [[pimp]]s and [[gangster]]s with politically conscious material commenting on the status of [[African Americans]] in the South. OutKast won Best New Rap Group at the [[Source Awards]] in 1995.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" /> Within the mess that was the East Coast - West Coast feud, André came up on stage followed by boos from the crowd and said, "But it's like this though, I'm tired of them closed-minded folks, it's like we gotta demo tape but don't nobody want to hear it. But it's like this: the South got something to say, that's all I got to say." As eloquently stated by rapper T.I., "Outkast, period. Outkast. That's when it changed. That was the first time when people began to take Southern rap seriously."<ref>{{Citation|last=TheMaxTrailers|title=Outkast winning Best New Rap Group at the Source Awards 1995|date=2014-10-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwLG7aSYM3w| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/vwLG7aSYM3w| archive-date=2021-10-30|access-date=2018-05-06}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In the same year, the group contributed "Benz or a Beamer" to the popular [[New Jersey Drive]] soundtrack.

===1995–1999: Breakthrough with ''ATLiens'' and ''Aquemini''===
After ''Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik'' was certified platinum, LaFace Records gave Outkast more creative control and advanced money for their follow-up album, which they recorded from 1995 to 1996.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Outkast|year=1997|journal=Black Diaspora|location=New York|volume=18|page=25}}</ref>

The duo took the opportunity to recreate their image. On a trip to [[Jamaica]] with producer [[Mr. DJ]], the two decided to abandon their [[Cornrows|cornrow]] hairstyles in favor of a more natural aesthetic, vowing to stop combing their hair.<ref name="Westhoff135">Westhoff, 2011. p. 135</ref> [[Dungeon Family]] member [[Big Rube]] observed an increase in the duo's confidence after returning from their first tour, remarking, "They started understanding the power they had in their music.  They started showing a swagger that certain artists have—the ones that are stars."<ref name="sarig139">Sarig, 2007. p. 139</ref>  The two also became more accustomed to playing live, particularly Big Boi, and André 3000 significantly changed his lifestyle, as he adopted a more eccentric fashion sense, became a vegetarian, and stopped smoking marijuana.<ref name="Nickson46">Nickson (2004), p. 46.</ref> The members also underwent changes in their personal lives; in 1995, Big Boi's girlfriend gave birth to their first child and André 3000 and [[Total (group)|Total]]'s Keisha Spivey ended their two-year relationship.<ref name="sarig140">Sarig, 2007. p. 140</ref>

The double platinum album, ''[[ATLiens]]'', was released on August 27, 1996. The album exhibited a notably more laid-back, spacey production sound, taking influence from [[Dub music|dub]] and [[reggae]].<ref name="aqueminirev">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/aquemini-mw0000043056|title=Aquemini – OutKast|last=Huey|first=Steve|work=[[Allmusic|AllMusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|access-date=December 21, 2012}}</ref><ref name="OutKast">{{cite journal|last1=Pauley|first1=Jared|title=OutKast|journal=Oxford Music Online|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref> On ''ATLiens'', André 3000 and Big Boi abandoned the "hard-partying playa characters" of their debut album in favor of more spacey, futuristic personas, and produced many of the songs on their own for the first time.<ref name="sarig140"/><ref name="allmusicrev">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/atliens-mw0000175875|title=ATLiens – OutKast|first=Steve|last=Huey|work=AllMusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=July 10, 2012}}</ref> Their tracks have an outer-space feeling to them- a feeling that, ironically, has warmed the community right up to them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Outkast- ATLiens|publisher=Encyclopediaof Popular Music}}</ref>  Critics praised the group's maturing musical style on the record, which debuted at number two on the U.S. The album would climb to number three on Billboard's top R&B/Hip Hop chart.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Love|first1=Betina|title=Chapter Three: The New South Gone With the Beat}}</ref> [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and sold nearly 350,000 copies in its first two weeks of release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&s_site=mercurynews&p_multi=SJ&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB71FFBDA46427F&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Pearl Jam's 'No Code' to Top Albums Chart|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=September 7, 1996|access-date=March 5, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-09-15/entertainment/ca-44034_1_keith-sweat|title=The Charts – 'ATLiens' Landing|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 15, 1996|access-date=March 5, 2011}}</ref> The single "[[Elevators (Me & You)]]" reached number 12 and spent 20 weeks on the [[Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart.<ref name="hot100">{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=outkast|chart=Hot 100}}|title=OutKast Album & Song Chart History – Hot 100|work=Billboard|publisher=Prometheus Global Media|access-date=March 5, 2011}}</ref> ''ATLiens'' further solidified OutKast as the flagship representatives of the 1st generation Dungeon Family and the Southern hip hop movement. The album helped the group earn more recognition among [[East Coast hip hop]] fans in the East and West coasts.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

For this album, Outkast joined with partner [[Mr. DJ|David "Mr. DJ" Sheats]] to form the Earthtone III production company, which allowed the group to produce some of their own tracks. "[[ATLiens (song)|ATLiens]]" was the group's second [[Top 40]] single (following "Player's Ball" from their first album), and reflected the beginning of André's increasingly sober lifestyle:<ref>(September 18, 2005).

Outkast's third album ''[[Aquemini]]'' was released on September 29, 1998. It was also certified double platinum and reached the number-two position on the Billboard 200 album chart in the United States; its title was a combination of the [[zodiac sign]]s of Big Boi (an [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]) and André (a [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]).<ref name="OutKast"/> Producing more material themselves, both Big Boi and André explored more eclectic subject matter, delving into sounds inspired by [[soul music|soul]], [[trip hop]], and [[electro music]]. The album featured production by Organized Noize and collaborations with [[Raekwon]], [[Slick Rick]], [[funk music|funk]] pioneer and musical forebear [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]], and Goodie Mob. Outkast forged the connections between Hip Hop and the black freedom struggle with their controversial song "Rosa Parks" featured on the album.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Alridge|first1=Derrick|title=From Civil Rights to Hip Hop: Toward a Nexus of Ideas|journal=The Journal of African American History|year=2005|volume=90|issue=3|pages=226–252|doi=10.1086/JAAHv90n3p226|jstor=20063999|s2cid=141692523}}</ref>

Originally titled 'Sandbox', the pair's fourth album, ''[[Stankonia]]'' was released in October 2000 to positive reviews. The album was seen as a change in the group's musical style, as it had a more commercial and mainstream appeal, compared to their previous three albums which were darker and deeper. It debuted at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 in the U.S., and would eventually be certified [[RIAA certification|quadruple platinum]]. ''[[Stankonia]]'s'' first single was "[[B.O.B. (Bombs Over Baghdad)]]", a high-[[tempo]]-influenced record. The second single, "[[Ms. Jackson]]", combined a pop hook with lyrics about [[divorce]] and relationship breakups, particularly André's breakup with singer [[Erykah Badu]]; the titular "Ms. Jackson" character being a [[doppelgänger]] for Badu's mother. It was at this time that André changed his stage name to the current "André 3000," mostly to avoid being mixed up with [[Dr. Dre]].

The single became their first pop hit, landing the number-one position on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and the number-two position on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The album's final single was the Organized Noize-produced "So Fresh, So Clean", featuring a credited guest appearance from regular guest vocalist and Organized Noize-member [[Sleepy Brown]] and garnered a remix featuring [[Snoop Dogg]]. All three singles' videos had heavy [[MTV2]] airplay, and OutKast won two 2001 [[Grammy Award]]s, one for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]] for "Ms. Jackson", and another for ''[[Stankonia]]'' as [[Best Rap Album]].<ref>Cowie, Del F..

In December 2001, Outkast released a [[greatest hits]] album, ''[[Big Boi and Dre Present...OutKast]]'', which also contained three new tracks. One of these new tracks was the single "[[The Whole World]]", which won a 2002 Grammy Award for [[Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group]]. [[Killer Mike]] also was featured on the song, gaining some exposure among areas outside of his native Atlanta. The other two new songs were called "Funkin' Around" and "Movin' Cool (The After Party)".

===2002–2004: ''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below''===
Outkast spent two years working on their 5th effort, before releasing a double album, ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', on September 23, 2003. It is essentially two solo albums, one by each member, packaged as a single release under the Outkast banner; the two members also appear and co produce on each other's discs for a few songs apiece. Big Boi's ''Speakerboxxx'' is largely a funk and Dirty South blended party record; André 3000's ''The Love Below'' features only brief instances of hip hop, presenting instead elements found in [[funk music|funk]], jazz, rock, electronic music, and [[R&B]].<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The album is also Outkast's biggest commercial success yet, having debuted on the ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart at number-one and stayed there for several weeks. The album eventually sold over five million copies, and, as double-album sales count double for [[Recording Industry Association of America]] certification, the album was certified [[RIAA certification|diamond]] for 10 million units shipped in December 2004. Its latest certification, in May 2006, reaches 11 million copies in shipping.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

The first two singles from the album(s), which were released nearly simultaneously, were Big Boi's "[[The Way You Move]]" and Andre 3000's "[[Hey Ya!]]" The video's storyline has "The Love Below"—a fictional band with all members, through the use of [[special effects]], played by André—performing in [[London]]. "Hey Ya!" was the number one song on the very final weekend of ''[[American Top 40]] with [[Casey Kasem]]''. It was also number one a week later on the very first weekend of American Top 40 with [[Ryan Seacrest]]. The singles spent ten weeks at number one on the [[Hot 100]] singles chart, with "The Way You Move" spending nine weeks and "Hey Ya!" taking over for one week in February 2004. These singles were seen as a breakthrough for the hip-hop industry, being among the first hip-hop songs to be widely played on adult contemporary radio stations.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

Outkast's next official single was not released until the summer of 2004. "[[Roses (Outkast song)|Roses]]", a track featuring both members from ''The Love Below'' half of the album, did not meet the level of success as either of its predecessors, but it became a modest-sized hit on urban radio and the American music video networks. The video for "Roses" is loosely based on the musicals ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' and ''[[Grease (musical)|Grease]]''. It featured sparring 1950s-style gangs, one representing ''Speakerboxxx'', and one representing ''The Love Below'', parodying the widespread arguing among critics and fans as to which half of the album was better. It deviates from these musicals in its final act, however, by featuring André 3000 defecating in a bouquet of roses before entering a [[Ramping Shop]] and presenting them to the receptionist. This closing scene was nominated as a finalist for the BET "Realest Music Video of All Time" award. The final singles were André 3000's "[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Prototype]]", which was paired with a [[science fiction]]-themed video about alien visitors, and ''Speakerboxxx''{{'}}s "[[Ghettomusick/Prototype|Ghettomusick]]", which featured both members of Outkast and a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] from a song by [[Patti LaBelle]], who also makes an appearance in the video.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

''Speakerboxxx/The Love Below'' won the Grammy Award for the 2004. OutKast was one of the headlining acts at the show, and gave two performances: Big Boi performed "The Way You Move" with the Outkast backing band during a medley with Earth Wind & Fire, [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Robert Randolph (guitarist)|Robert Randolph]], while André 3000 performed "Hey Ya!" as the show closer after they had been presented with the Album Of The Year Award.

===2005–2006: ''Idlewild''===
Members also began working on a joint film, ''[[Idlewild (film)|Idlewild]]'', directed by Outkast music video director [[Bryan Barber]]. ''Idlewild'', a [[Prohibition]]-era musical film set to a [[blues]]-influenced hip-hop soundtrack, was released on August 25, 2006 by [[Universal Pictures]]. The ''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild soundtrack]]'' was released August 22, 2006. In an interview for ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', [[Big Boi]] stated "This is an Outkast album. It isn't like a soundtrack where we go get this person or that person".<ref name="Mitchell"/>

The first single of the album, "Mighty 'O'", features both [[André 3000]] and [[Big Boi]]; the song takes its lyrical hook from the [[Cab Calloway]] song "[[Minnie the Moocher]]" ("Mighty-ighty-ighty O") and seems to be an example of the album's mix of [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and more traditional American [[jazz]] and [[blues music|blues]].  Next, similar to previous Outkast albums such as ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'', two [[single (music)|singles]]—one solely by Big Boi, the other solely by André 3000—were released simultaneously. The second single, almost exclusively featuring Big Boi, is the [[marching band]]–influenced "Morris Brown", featuring guest artists [[Sleepy Brown]] and Scar, both artists on Big Boi's [[Purple Ribbon Records|Purple Ribbon]] label. The song's title is a reference to [[Atlanta]]'s [[Morris Brown College]], with the school's marching band providing the instrumentation.

The third single, André 3000's "Idlewild Blue (Don'tchu Worry 'Bout Me)" delves into the [[blues]] genre, complete with a blues-style [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]] riff and a [[harmonica]] element reminiscent of ''[[Aquemini]]'' single "Rosa Parks". In tune with the film, ''Idlewild'' reflects OutKast's original style tempered by 1930s influences. The fourth single, "Hollywood Divorce" was released in November 2006, and features verses from [[Lil' Wayne]] and [[Snoop Dogg]] and is produced by André 3000.

===2007–2013: Hiatus and solo work===
In 2007 after the sixth album under the Outkast name, ''[[Idlewild (Outkast album)|Idlewild]]'', Big Boi announced plans to release a full-fledged solo album. While he had released a previous solo album in ''Speakerboxxx'', it still was technically under the Outkast name. The album was later titled ''[[Sir Lucious Left Foot: The Son of Chico Dusty]]''. The album's first promotional single, "Royal Flush", was released in 2007, and featured [[Raekwon]] and André 3000. After many delays and setbacks, the album was finally released internationally on July 5, 2010. Guest artists include singer Janelle Monáe; Big Boi's own new group Vonnegutt; plus established rappers T.I. and B.o.B.<ref>[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/559/boi_o_boi/ Big Boi: Boy O Boi!].

He also appeared on [[John Legend]]'s album, ''[[Evolver (John Legend album)|Evolver]]'', on the track "[[Green Light (John Legend song)|Green Light]]", which was released on October 28, 2008. Prior to the release, Benjamin commented: "It's going to be a surprise for a lot of John Legend fans, because it is a lot more upbeat than John is—than people think John is. I was actually happy to hear it. This is a cool John Legend song." Benjamin has stated that he is making a solo rap album, and that the response to his remixes is part of the motivation for it.<ref>[http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/07/11/andre-3000-reveals-a-solo-album-is-on-the-way/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301055304/http://www.grounduphiphop.com/2007/07/11/andre-3000-reveals-a-solo-album-is-on-the-way/|date=March 1, 2009}}</ref> In September 2011 it was announced that Outkast was moved to [[Epic Records]] following restructuring within [[Sony Music Entertainment]].

==Musical style and influences==
Outkast's musical style and lyrical content have evolved throughout the group's career. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' described their music as "idiosyncratic" and "inspired by the Afrocentric [[psychedelic music|psychedelics]] of [[George Clinton (funk musician)|George Clinton]] and [[Sly Stone]].

On several tracks on ''Stankonia'', the group employed faster, more chaotic tempos to reflect rave culture and the introduction of new drugs such as [[MDMA|ecstasy]] into the hip-hop scene.<ref name="Reynolds333"/>

One central motif of Outkast's songwriting is the duality of the two members and their differing personalities, with Big Boi as "the player" and Andre 3000 as "the poet".<ref name=yaleherald>{{cite news|url=http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxvi/11.13.98/ae/outkasst.html|title=Records: OutKast's Aquemini|last=Austerlitz|first=Saul|access-date=May 10, 2014|work=[[Yale Herald]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151218064817/http://www.yaleherald.com/archive/xxvi/11.13.98/ae/outkasst.html|archive-date=December 18, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Big Boi generally covers the more conventional hip-hop topics such as his childhood in the South, sex, and partying, while Andre 3000 discusses more unorthodox themes.<ref name="citypages">{{cite web|url=http://www.citypages.com/1998-10-14/music/outkast-aquemini/full/|title=OutKast: Aquemini|last=Herrington|first=Chris|date=October 14, 1998|access-date=May 10, 2014|work=City Pages|publisher=[[Voice Media Group]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140512223320/http://www.citypages.com/1998-10-14/music/outkast-aquemini/full/|archive-date=May 12, 2014|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In contrast to much of hip hop music in the late 1990s, Outkast did not tone down its Southern regional qualities, like the [[harmonica]] break on "Rosa Parks" and distinctive [[Atlanta]] slang and diction throughout.

== Lawsuit ==
{{Main|Parks v. LaFace Records}}
In May 1999, Outkast and [[LaFace Records]] were [[lawsuit|sued]] by [[Rosa Parks]] over ''Aquemini'''s most successful radio single, which bears Parks' name as its title. The lawsuit alleged that the song misappropriates Parks' name, and it objected to the song's [[obscenity|obscenities]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Aliya|title=Rosa Parks Sues OutKast|journal=Billboard: The International Newsweekly of Music, Video and Home Entertainment|date=April 17, 1999|volume=108|issue=4|page=6}}</ref>

The song's lyrics are virtually unrelated to Parks, except for a reference in the chorus: "Ah ha, hush that fuss / Everybody move to the back of the bus". The song, which Outkast maintained was intended partly as [[Homage (arts)|homage]], refers to Parks metaphorically: the purpose of the song's chorus is to imply that Outkast is overturning hip hop's old order, and that people should make way for a new style and sound. In the initial suit, the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor granted summary judgment for Outkast.

Later on appeal, the issue of whether Outkast violated the [[Lanham Act]] for [[false advertising]] was reversed and remanded for further proceedings. This was based on the Court's determination that the title "Rosa Parks" had little artistic relevance, whether symbolic or metaphorical, to Rosa Parks the person. Parks' representation hired lawyer [[Johnnie Cochran]] to appeal the decision in 2001, but the appeal was denied. The judge ruled that while there was linkage between the song and Rosa Parks, the song was an "expressive work" and was therefore protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. In 2003, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] turned down an appeal to overrule the lower court's decision.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

In December 2003, André told UK journalist Angus Batey that, following a [[Detroit]] concert in the midst of the legal battle, relatives of Parks had approached him and implied that the case had less to do with Parks than with the lawyers.<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,20029-2302431.html &#91;Title/date?&#93;].

The case was settled on 14 April 2005, with Outkast and the co-defendants, [[Sony BMG]] and its subsidiaries Arista Records and LaFace Records, admitting no wrongdoing but agreeing to develop and fund educational programs concerning Rosa Parks.<ref>"[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/15/business/media/rap-group-settles-rosa-parks-lawsuit.html Rap Group Settles Rosa Parks Lawsuit]".
