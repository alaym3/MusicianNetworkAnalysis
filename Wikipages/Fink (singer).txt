'''Fin Greenall''', known professionally as '''Fink''', is an English singer, songwriter, guitarist, producer, and DJ born in [[Cornwall]] and currently based in [[Berlin]] and London. From 1997–2003, he focused on electronic music and DJ'd internationally, releasing in 2000 his debut album ''Fresh Produce'' on [[Ninja Tune]]. Since the 2006 release of his album ''[[Biscuits for Breakfast]]'', the name Fink has also referred to the recording and touring trio fronted by Greenall himself, completed by Guy Whittaker (bass) and [[Tim Thornton (musician, born 1973)|Tim Thornton]] (drums).

Most recently, he has written in collaboration with [[John Legend]], [[Banks (singer)|Banks]], [[Ximena Sarinana]] and [[Professor Green]]. With [[Amy Winehouse]], he co-wrote the song "Half Time", which appears on Winehouse's posthumous collection ''[[Lioness: Hidden Treasures]]''. In 2012, Fink collaborated and performed with the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] in Amsterdam, resulting in the live album ''[[Fink Meets The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]''. Fink is signed to his own label, R'COUP'D Records, a subsidiary of [[Ninja Tune]], on which he has released his latest albums.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Greenall was born 1972 in [[Cornwall]] and grew up in [[Bristol]]. Greenall recalls "the one thing of his dad's that he wasn't allowed to touch was the old Martin acoustic guitar." Greenall said, "It was his one possession where he said, 'everything in this house is owned by everybody – apart from that.'"<ref name="Ninja Tune Interview">{{cite web|url=http://ninjatune.net/artist/fink |title=Fink / Artists / Ninja Tune |publisher=Ninjatune.net |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> Their presence influenced his future in music. "The great thing about growing up in a house where music is a big factor... was the fact that music being part of your life was a perfectly natural thing." During his teenage years, he accumulated eclectic musical interests, gravitating towards [[The Cure]], [[The Smiths]], The Orb, African music, and Japanese hardcore, before discovering electronic and dance music at [[University of Leeds]].

He earned his degree in History and English at University of Leeds and, with student friends, formed the short-lived dance act EVA, who signed to Kikin' Records in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/fink/biography|title=RA: Fink|website=Resident Advisor|access-date=31 July 2020}}</ref> For the remainder of the 1990s and much of the early 2000s, Greenall worked in the music industry for various London-based labels, including [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]'s Source, [[Def Jam]], and [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]]. Simultaneously, he pursued a musical career, remixing and producing for various artists, including [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] and [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] but also as a DJ.<ref name="Beat Magazine April 2006 Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.beatmag.net/april06/fink.htm|title=Beatmag Interview-Fink|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522042719/http://www.beatmag.net/april06/fink.htm|archive-date=22 May 2009|access-date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

=== Career ===
[[File:GreenallCouleur3.jpg|thumb|right|Greenall performing in Lausanne, Switzerland]]
Fink's serious recording career began with [[Ninja Tune]] subsidiary N-Tone's release of his debut single "Fink Funk" in 1997,<ref name="Fink Discogs.com entry">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Fink-Fink-Funk/release/58521 |title=Fink – Fink Funk (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> followed by the album ''Fresh Produce'' in 2000, a well received chill-out set that fitted neatly with the output of the label. In the following years, he continued to produce other artists, including [[Martin Taylor (guitarist)|Martin Taylor]], [[Michael Pitt]] and [[Robert Belfour]].

Towards the mid-2000s, Greenall developed a disillusionment with dance music and being a DJ and began to turn to more traditional musical avenues. It was this feeling which resulted in 2006's ''[[Biscuits for Breakfast]]'', the first album to feature current collaborators Guy Whittaker and [[Tim Thornton (musician, born 1973)|Tim Thornton]], with whom Greenall had been friends for a few years but had not yet worked. Built around his bluesy voice, finger-picking acoustic guitar and the stripped-back live rhythm section, the self-produced ''Biscuits'' boasted a fledgling pop sensibility while retaining some of the signature Ninja Tune sonic hallmarks. He became the label's first singer/songwriter.<ref name="Beat Magazine April 2006 Interview"/> The album, along with single "Pretty Little Thing", helped define his style and began to bring his name to a wider, and higher-profile, audience, notably [[Zero 7]], who invited Fink to support them on their UK tour.

=== 2007–2009: ''Distance and Time'' and ''Sort of Revolution'' ===
During the extensive European and American tours which accompanied ''Biscuits'', Greenall began to write songs for the follow-up album. For this, he collaborated both with his bandmates and third parties, teaming up with [[Blair MacKichan]] for the writing of the "This is the Thing", and producer Andy Barlow of [[Lamb (electronic band)|Lamb]]. The eventual album, ''[[Distance and Time]]'', was released through Ninja Tune in October 2007, and was immediately recognised as a more robust, band-led affair than its predecessor, with [[musicOMH]] stating that "the soft-spoken confessionals of their debut are more accomplished this time, taken to the big city and returned home just as wounded, but more worldly-unwise than their little brothers."<ref name="musicOMH Review">[http://www.musicomh.com/albums/fink-2_0907.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629155839/http://www.musicomh.com/albums/fink-2_0907.htm |date=29 June 2011 }}</ref> The tour following [[Distance And Time|Distance]]'s release took Fink to new territories such as Germany, South Africa and Canada, and also saw the band supporting Italian rock band [[Negramaro]] at their climactic [[San Siro (stadium)|San Siro]] stadium show in [[Milan]].

[[File:Fink3backstageMassy2011byTommyNLance.jpeg|thumb|right|The Fink trio (L-R Greenall, Whittaker, Thornton)]]
One of ''[[Distance and Time]]''{{'}}s tracks "If Only" attracted the attention of American singer-songwriter [[John Legend]], with whom Greenall collaborated on tracks for his album ''[[Evolver (John Legend album)|Evolver]]''. The hit single "[[Green Light (John Legend song)|Green Light]]", featuring [[André 3000]], won a [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI Award]] for Greenall in 2010.<ref name="Music Week BMI Awards article">{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Paul |url=http://www.musicweek.com/story.asp?sectioncode=1&storycode=1038853 |title=Bedingfield pockets two BMI awards |publisher=Music Week |date=7 October 2009 |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> Legend reciprocated by collaborating on songs for Fink's 2009 album ''[[Sort of Revolution]]''. Greenall decided to return to production duties for this set, resulting in a more experimental approach that the [[BBC]]'s Keira Burgess described as a "sublime study in the art of pleasing yourself without drowning in indulgence".<ref name="BBC Review">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/38n8 |title=Music – Review of Fink – Sort of Revolution |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> [[Radiohead]] became a fan of Fink's work at this time, posting the song "Q&A" on their website playlist.<ref name="Radiohead Site">{{cite web |url=http://radiohead.com/deadairspace/090522/office-chart-for-friday |title=Dead Air Space |publisher=Radiohead.Com |access-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731030424/http://www.radiohead.com/deadairspace/090522/office-chart-for-friday |archive-date=31 July 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[BBC Radio One]] DJ [[Gilles Peterson]], who commissioned a live session for his late-night show, recorded at the BBC's [[Maida Vale Studios]].<ref name="Gilles Peterson tracklisting">{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/gillespeterson/tracklistingarchive.shtml?20090910 |title=Radio 1 – Gilles Peterson – Tracklisting |publisher=BBC |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

''[[Sort of Revolution]]'''s accompanying tour was more extensive than previous outings, taking the band to China and Australia for the first time. In the latter country, Fink headlined a three-night stand at the [[Sydney Festival]].<ref name="Sydney Festival 2010">{{cite web |url=http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/2010/Music/Fink/ |title=Sydney Festival 2010 – Fink |publisher=Sydneyfestival.org.au |access-date=9 August 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121127134146/http://www.sydneyfestival.org.au/2010/Music/Fink/ |archive-date=27 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was during this trip that Greenall met [[Professor Green]], and the pair decided on a collaboration for Green's upcoming debut album, 2010's ''[[Alive Till I'm Dead]]''. The track, "Closing The Door", features a rap from Green, a sung vocal from Greenall and instrumental backing from Thornton and Whittaker. The experience led Green to request a further partnership, this time for his 2011 release ''[[At Your Inconvenience]]'', another full-band collaboration on "Spinning Out", a reworking of The [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] 1987 classic "[[Where Is My Mind]]".

On the American trip for the ''Revolution'' album, Fink was invited to perform at a tribute concert for [[R.E.M.]] at New York City's [[Carnegie Hall]]. Greenall performed a solo rendition of "The Apologist" from the band's 1998 album ''[[Up (R.E.M. album)|Up]]''.<ref name="Paste Magazine Carnegie Hall gig feature">{{cite news|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/blogs/ctrl-v/2009/03/rem-benefit-and-tribute.html|author=Henry Freedland|title=All The Right Friends: On R.E.M.'s Carnegie Hall Tribute and Benefit Concert|publisher=Paste magazine}}</ref>

=== 2011–2012: ''Perfect Darkness'' ===
Songwriting sessions for Fink's fifth full-length album began in early 2010. For this album, Greenall's process was very different. Greenall recounted in an interview that "after all the live shows and all the fun we'd had on stage, we jammed first as a band. No vocals, just these massive soundscapes. We did about 30 of them. Then a couple of weeks later, go through them, pick the best bits. "Perfect Darkness", the song, was one riff, one bass line and one moment of a 20-minute jam."<ref name="China Shop Mag interview">[http://www.chinashopmag.com/2011/08/fink-biscuits-distance-revolution-and-perfection/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120606085928/http://www.chinashopmag.com/2011/08/fink-biscuits-distance-revolution-and-perfection/ |date=6 June 2012 }}</ref> The band travelled to Los Angeles to record the subsequent album with producer [[Billy Bush (producer)|Billy Bush]].

[[File:FinkParadiso2011byTommyNLance.jpg|thumb|right|Fink onstage at Paradiso, Amsterdam, 2011, with [[59 Productions]]' stage set]]
On 27 March 2011, the track "Perfect Darkness" was made available for free download via the band's website, followed by the album release on 13 June. The critical reception the album received was positive, with ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'}}s Caroline Sullivan describing it as a "delight... achieves such loveliness you don't want it to end",<ref name="Guardian Perfect Darkness review">{{cite web|author=Caroline Sullivan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/09/fink-perfect-darkness-review |title=Fink: Perfect Darkness – review |publisher=The Guardian |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref> and the [[BBC]]'s Ian Wade calling the set "a writhing, surprisingly meaty addition to the over-crowded singer-songwriter genre."<ref name="BBC Perfect Darkness review">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/24pn |title=Music – Review of Fink – Perfect Darkness |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=9 August 2014}}</ref>

To support the album, the band took the decision to enlarge their stage show considerably, not with additional musicians but with a visual production, designed by 59 Productions, famed for working with [[Jón Þór Birgisson|Jónsi]] and on the stage show ''[[War Horse (play)|War Horse]]''. Says Greenall: "They’ve been part of the album big time since the moment we started to write it because we knew that they would be involved with the stage show. They've custom engineered the show that doesn’t overpower the music but just kind of embraces you and it emphasises some of the atmospherics in the music."<ref name="Soul Culture interview"/> The live show involved a frame to which 48 [[Anglepoise]] lamps were screwed, and eight gauze visual screens. The subsequent tour took Fink on 49 dates in fourteen countries throughout autumn 2011, including London's [[Union Chapel, Islington|Union Chapel]], where ''[[The Times]]''{{'}} David Sinclair found the show "a perfect storm of profound, brooding emotion."

In 2012, Fink featured alongside [[Professor Green]] on "[[Read All About It, Pt. II]]", a new version of Green's hit single "[[Read All About It (song)|Read All About It]]" featuring [[Emeli Sandé]]. The song was recorded for [[Q (magazine)|''Q'' magazine]]. In November 2012, Fink played their largest UK headline show to date, at London's [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]].

=== 2012–2013: "Queen's Night" concert with Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra ===
In October 2011 Fink were approached by the [[Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]] of the [[Netherlands]], and Dutch classical music charity Entree, to perform with the orchestra on the traditional Queen's night concert the following year. The concert took place on 29 April 2012 at the [[Concertgebouw]] in Amsterdam, and featured classical pieces chosen by the band, along with exclusive arrangements of 6 songs from across Fink's catalogue, scored by Jules Buckley of the [[Heritage Orchestra]]. Also performed was Buckley's arrangement of [[Henry Purcell]]'s "What Power Art Thou", sung by Greenall. Claudia Cuypers of [[Muziekkrant OOR|OOR]] stated that "the orchestra gives [Fink's] songs a new, unexpected power and lightness... in this hall his songs become complete, even though you'd thought they already were."<ref name="OOR Concert review">{{cite web|url=http://oor.nl/#reviews/concerts/1984/concertgebouworkest_maakt_fink_completer|title=OOR|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217032432/http://www.oor.nl/|archive-date=17 February 2016|access-date=19 February 2016}}</ref>

The orchestra commissioned a special [[iPad]] application for the event, on which worldwide viewers could stream audio and video footage of the concert live, in real time: the first time such an application has been used for this purpose in the Netherlands.

On 14 October 2013, a live album of the concert was released through [[Ninja]], entitled ''[[Fink Meets The Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra]]''.

===2014–2015: ''Hard Believer'' and ''Horizontalism''===
On 19 March 2014, Fink released the first song from their new album, "Hard Believer".  The song was made available for free download from the band's website, and streaming on [[SoundCloud]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indieshuffle.com/fink-hard-believer/ |author=Chaze Matakala|title=Fink's ''Hard Believer'' – What's so good?|publisher=Indie Shuffle.com|access-date=20 March 2014}}</ref> A week later, Fink confirmed that a new album entitled ''[[Hard Believer]]'' would be released in summer 2014.

''[[Hard Believer]]'' was released on 14 July 2014 through a new Ninja Tune imprint R'COUP'D. Like its predecessor, it was produced by [[Billy Bush (producer)|Billy Bush]]. Buoyed by the radio success of the single "Looking Too Closely", the album charted in several territories, including a top 10 appearance in the Netherlands (number 8), number 25 in Germany, and at Top 30 slot on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] album chart in the US.

Following the success of the ''[[Hard Believer]]'' album Greenall made an alternative version of the album using some more of the atmospheric sounds from the record, which emerged in May 2015 as ''Horizontalism.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ninjatune.net/release/fink/horizontalism|title=Horizontalism by Fink|website=Ninja Tune|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>

=== 2017: ''Fink's Sunday Night Blues Club, Vol. 1'' and ''Resurgam'' ===
On 10 March 2017, Fink released a more blues-oriented album called ''Fink’s Sunday Night Blues Club, Vol. 1''. Considered a “side project” "after the pressure of Hard Believer, and the studio time of Horizontalism, to do something raw, rough, and live, a record that just was, for its own sake", it was recorded in Fink's apartment in Berlin. The album was produced and mixed by Fink and Flood; each track was recorded “fast, live, using one vintage mic, and one vintage amp.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://la-mission.com/en/finks-sunday-night-blues-club/|title=Fink's Sunday Night Blues Club – La Mission|website=la-mission.com|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref> The track ''Cold Feet'' was later used in the television show [[Slip (Better Call Saul)|Better Call Saul]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/finkmusic/posts/10154379948446923|title=Fink – BETTER CALL SAUL|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-01-17}}</ref>

On 15 September 2017, again through R'COUP'D, Fink released their album ''[[Resurgam (Fink album)|Resurgam]]'', with previous releases of the singles "Cracks Appear" on 31 July and "Not Everything Was Better in the Past" on 29 August. The album was recorded entirely at the Assault & Battery studios in London with producer [[Flood (producer)|Flood]]. Fink subsequently announced an autumn tour with more than 60 dates across 19 countries, with the band including two drummers for their live performances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finkmusic.bandcamp.com/album/resurgam|title=Resurgam, by Fink|website=Fink|access-date=2017-09-16}}</ref>

=== 2019: ''Bloom Innocent'' ===

On 25 October 2019, Fink released their album ''[[Bloom Innocent (Fink album)|Bloom Innocent]]''. It was again produced by [[Flood (producer)|Flood]].

=== Other collaborations ===
In 2005, Greenall sings the track "Dead Man" on [[Nitin Sawhney]]'s album Philtre.

Fink appeared on [[Bonobo (musician)|Bonobo]]'s 2006 album ''[[Days to Come (album)|Days to Come]]'' for the track "If You Stayed Over" (an adaptation of which became "Make It Good", from Fink's own ''[[Distance And Time]]'' album).

In 2008, Fink appeared on the [[John Legend]] album ''[[Evolver (John Legend album)|Evolver]]'', having co-written "Greenlight" and co-produced and co-written "Set Me Free".

Fink also continues to operate within the dance music scene under the name Sideshow on Will Saul's Simple Records, with seven releases to his name. An album, ''Admit One'', was released in January 2009. He also continues to record under various guises, currently Quantum Entanglement with Berlin-based DJ Lee Jones.

In November 2011, he has spoken of his early sessions with [[Amy Winehouse]], saying, "the songs were there, her voice was there, and she was genuinely who she was, and that was obvious even at 17. She was a no compromise, full-on artist. It was just awesome to work with her."<ref name="Soul Culture interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/features/interviews/fink-rolling-with-the-punches-interview/ |title=Fink: Rolling With The Punches &#124; Interview |website=SoulCulture |date= 8 November 2011|access-date=11 July 2020}}</ref>

In 2012, Fink appeared on the Season 2 pilot episode of an Indian musical show called ''[[The Dewarists]]'' along with composer [[Salim-Sulaiman]] from [[India]] and [[Shafqat Amanat Ali]] from [[Pakistan]].

In 2013 Fink collaborated with [[John Legend]] on the [[12 Years a Slave (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]] to ''[[12 Years a Slave (film)|12 Years a Slave]]'', having co-written and performed "Move".
