'''Hayley Nichole Williams''' (born December 27, 1988) is an American singer, songwriter, musician, and businesswoman who is best known as the lead vocalist, primary songwriter, and keyboardist of the rock band [[Paramore]].

Born and raised in Mississippi, Williams moved to [[Franklin, Tennessee]] at the age of 13 just after her parents divorced in 2002. In 2004, she formed Paramore alongside [[Josh Farro]], [[Zac Farro]], and [[Jeremy Davis]]. The band currently consists of Hayley Williams, Zac Farro and [[Taylor York]]. The band has released five studio albums: ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'' (2005), ''[[Riot!]]'' (2007), ''[[Brand New Eyes]]'' (2009), ''[[Paramore (album)|Paramore]]'' (2013), and ''[[After Laughter]]'' (2017).

Williams released her debut solo single "[[Simmer (song)|Simmer]]" on January 22, 2020, and announced on the same day that her debut studio album, ''[[Petals for Armor]]'', would be released on May 8, 2020. The album was preceded by two EPs entitled ''[[Petals for Armor I]]'' and ''[[Petals for Armor II|II]]'' that make up the first two-thirds of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/paramore-hayley-williams-announces-debut-solo-album-shares-new-song-listen/|title=Paramore's Hayley Williams Announces Debut Solo Album, Shares New Song: Listen|website=Pitchfork|date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> Her second solo record, ''[[Flowers for Vases / Descansos]]'', was released less than a year later on February 5, 2021.<ref name="RS">{{cite news |last1=Shaffer |first1=Claire |title=Hayley Williams Teases New Album 'Flowers for Vases / Descansos' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hayley-williams-flowers-for-vases-descansos-1123758/ |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=February 4, 2021}}</ref>

Aside from Paramore and preceding her solo career, Williams recorded the song "Teenagers" for the soundtrack of ''[[Jennifer's Body]]'' (2009) and has collaborated with artists such as [[October Fall]], [[The Chariot (band)|The Chariot]], [[Set Your Goals (band)|Set Your Goals]], [[Zedd]] and [[New Found Glory]]. In 2010, she was featured on the single "[[Airplanes (song)|Airplanes]]" by [[B.o.B.]] It peaked at number two on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. A sequel to the song, "Airplanes, Part II", features new verses from B.o.B. and a verse from [[Eminem]], while Williams' vocals remain the same. This collaboration led to a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals|Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]].

Other ventures in which Williams has explored include online beauty and music series ''Kiss-Off'' on Popular TV launched in 2015 and the hair-dye company Good Dye Young, launched in 2016.

Atlantic decided to go along with her wishes, and she then formed Paramore with [[Josh Farro]], [[Zac Farro]], and [[Jeremy Davis]].<ref name="hitquarters" /> The music of Paramore was originally supposed to come out on Atlantic Records, but the label's marketing department decided it would be better for the image of the band to not have them attached to a huge label. They instead released their music through a "cooler" niche label, [[Fueled by Ramen]].<ref name="hitquarters" /> According to Williams, the name "Paramore" came from the maiden name of the mother of one of their first bass players.<ref>{{cite interview| subject= Paramore| title= Hello My Name Is| url= http://www.paramore.net/video| access-date= June 11, 2009}}</ref> Once the group learned the meaning of the homophone "[[wikt:paramour|paramour]]" ("secret lover"), they decided to adopt the name, using the ''Paramore'' spelling.<ref name="digital spy1"/><ref name="Euro">{{cite interview |subject=Josh Farro |subject2=Hayley Williams |subject3= Jeremy Davis| interviewer=cathyreay |title= Interview With Paramore |date=July 14, 2007| url=http://www.europunk.net/interviews/173 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413210756/http://www.europunk.net/interviews/173 | archive-date=April 13, 2009 |access-date=June 9, 2011}}</ref> The band's debut album, ''[[All We Know Is Falling]]'', was released in 2005 when Hayley was only 16 years old. Paramore has since released four more studio albums, ''[[Riot!]]'' (2007), ''[[Brand New Eyes]]'' (2009), the self-titled ''[[Paramore (album)|Paramore]]'' (2013) and ''[[After Laughter]]'' (2017). In June 2009, the band welcomed [[Taylor York]] (rhythm guitar) as an official member, although he had already been playing as a touring member with the band since 2007. In December 2010, two of the founding members of Paramore (Josh and Zac Farro) left the band. The news was posted by Williams on Paramore's website, with Josh later posting a blog post confirming their departure, calling the group "a manufactured product of a major label, riding on the coattails of 'Hayley's dream'".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/dec/23/ex-paramore-members-slam-hayley-williams|title=Ex-Paramore members slam Hayley Williams|date=December 23, 2010|publisher=theguardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|last=Karan|first=Tim|date=December 22, 2010|title=Josh Farro "finally tells the truth" about Paramore|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/josh_and_zac_farro_finally_tell_the_truth_about_paramore/|url-status=dead|magazine=[[Alternative Press (magazine)|Alternative Press]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107025120/https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/josh_and_zac_farro_finally_tell_the_truth_about_paramore/|archive-date=November 7, 2017|access-date=November 4, 2017}}</ref>

In October 2021, Williams announced that she would be discontinuing her use of personal social media accounts, citing the need for boundaries between her public and private life and a desire to "spend more time looking up and out, rather than down."
