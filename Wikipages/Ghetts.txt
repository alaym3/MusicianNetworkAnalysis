Known for his hard hitting lyrics and intricate rhyme schemes, he is associated and has toured internationally with such acts as [[Kano (rapper)|Kano]] and was a member of NASTY Crew.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hyperfrank.blogspot.com/2007/06/im-so-damn-dedicated-my-work-rate-and.html|title=Interview with Ghetto Hyperfrank Hyperfrank - Hyper About Grime|author=Hyperfrank|work=hyperfrank.blogspot.com}}</ref>

==Musical career==
Ghetts was a member of grime collective NASTY Crew, however he left, saying that things had gone "pear shaped" due to the number of people in the group. He later went on to create the grime collective The Movement, including [[Devlin (rapper)|Devlin]], [[Wretch 32]], [[Scorcher (rapper)|Scorcher]], Mercston, Lightning, and DJ Unique.
Ghetts<!-- is a very enthusiastic UK artist who [??? subjective.] --> has made a number of well-known songs within the UK [[grime (music genre)|grime]] scene. In 2008, Ghetts was nominated for a [[BET Award for Best International Act: UK]] along with [[Chipmunk (rapper)|Chipmunk]], [[Giggs (rapper)|Giggs]], and [[Skepta]]. In the end, Giggs took home the award.

In October 2020, Ghetts colloborated with [[Fraser T. Smith]] in the production of Smith's debut album "12 Questions".<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-18|title=RSL Honorary Fellowship: Fraser T Smith|url=https://www.rslawards.com/rsl-fellow-fraser-t-smith/|access-date=2021-08-21|website=RSL Awards|language=en-GB}}</ref>

===2005: ''2000 & Life''===
After being released from prison in 2003, at the age of nineteen years, Ghetto put out his first release, ''2000 & Life'' in 2005. The mixtape contains 24 tracks and numerous collaborations. ''2000 & Life'' is widely regarded as pioneering within the context of grime music.<ref>[http://archive.rwdmag.com/music/hip-hop-rnb/news/online-mixtape-review-ghetto-2000-amp-life Online Mixtape Review: Ghetto – 2000 & Life: RWD Magazine<!-- Bot generated title -->]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Initially after his release from prison, Ghetto was using the artist name "Freedom", however the name "wasn't catching on". His friends used to say he was "ghetto" and did "ghetto things", which began to catch on. [[Stormin]], a fellow Plaistow-based MC, released a song called "Day By Day" which contained the lyric, "''Back in the day me and my bredrin Ghetto''". Following the release, he took on the name "Ghetto".<ref name="auto">{{Citation|title='THE TRANSITION' FEATURING GHETTS - FOR THE CULTURE EP 35|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cJHKm-z2PY|access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dummymag.com/10-best/the-10-most-underrated-vocal-grime-tracks-according-to-ghetts/|title=The 10 most underrated vocal grime tracks, according to Ghetts|last=Dummy|website=DummyMag|access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref>

Ghetto featured on Kano's album ''[[Home Sweet Home (Kano album)|Home Sweet Home]]''. In 2004, they filmed the video for "[[Typical Me]]" together, and Ghetto accompanied Kano on touring with [[Mike Skinner (musician)|Mike Skinner]].<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newhamrecorder.co.uk/news/do-you-ghetts-me-rapper-reflects-on-plaistow-roots-1-3823550|title=Do you Ghetts me? Rapper reflects on Plaistow roots|last=Rasiah|first=Janine|website=Newham Recorder|access-date=23 November 2019}}</ref>

===2007: ''Ghetto Gospel''===
In 2007, Ghetto released his second pre-album mixtape ''Ghetto Gospel''. The mixtape was a departure from his previous release, ''2000 & Life'', being more mellow and featuring tracks about his female relationships: girlfriends, sister, and mother. In interviews, he has stated that the mixtape's calmer tone is to "prove people wrong", as he does not want to be [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as an aggressive and angry rapper.

'' Ghetto Gospel'' was considered Ghetts' breakthrough of that year and era, with "Top 3 Selected" becoming an underground hit in its own right. He personally names this mixtape as his best body of work in many interviews.

The album is titled ''Ghetto Gospel'' to demonstrate that Ghetts has put his [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] into creating it.

On 27 October 2007, Ghetts performed with Kano at the [[BBC Radio 2 Electric Proms|BBC Electric Proms]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/london/music/events/592294/bbc_electric_proms-kano_ghetto.html |title=BBC ELECTRIC PROMS: Kano + Ghetto at Jazz Café – Rock, pop & dance – Music – Time Out London<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023044342/http://www.timeout.com/london/music/events/592294/bbc_electric_proms-kano_ghetto.html |archive-date=23 October 2007 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> performing alongside a violinist.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/electricproms/2007/artists/ghetto/|title=BBC - Electric Proms 2007 - Ghetto|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Hypothetically, ''Ghetto Gospel'' was Ghetts' debut album in which he mislabelled it as a mixtape; due to a recent interview with [[Link Up TV]] where he described ''Ghetto Gospel'' being his first studio album, but became unsure as to what to label it due to industry influences and a lack of resources at that time to have called it a full LP. This means his debut album ''Rebel with a Cause'' (2014) is his second studio album.

===2008: ''Freedom of Speech'', Boy Better Know beef===
On 10 March 2008, Ghetto released ''Freedom of Speech''. It is predominantly a solo mixtape, and features no other producers aside Lewi White and Smasher (the pair responsible for "Back in Da Day").

Many grime fans say that ''Freedom of Speech'' is considered Ghetto's best body of work, especially with how dark and aggressive this mixtape was. Unknown to many, he also had "beef" with [[Boy Better Know]] (3 members from the crew that he had clashed previously in consecutive years) and two of the mixtape's songs were centered on each member of the crew. This type of promotion was what helped him increase record sales in famous retail stores. Some of the mixtape's content was banned from legal radio at the time, however, some of the songs' one-liners have go on to become famous trademarks in grime events.

It includes collaborations with Smasher, Griminal, Brutal, Chipmunk, and  Devlin. Ghetto stated that the mixtape is more akin to ''2000 & Life'' than ''Ghetto Gospel''. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

Ten years later, ''Freedom of Speech'' is still widely considered as a classic grime mixtape and most of the one-liners still get used for reloads in famous grime events such as Eskimo Dance.

===2010: ''The Calm Before the Storm''===
On 12 July 2010, Ghetto release his fourth mixtape under the alias Ghetts, entitled ''The Calm Before the Storm''. This was a highly anticipated release fusing the best elements of UK hip-hop and grime into this pre-album massacre. Ghetts immediately gives the people what they want; pure Grime bangers with Ghetts' ridiculous word play and flow in full effect. The opening track "Intro" provides a trademark murky riddim which Ghetts unleashes – schooling listeners on everything from collabos to his take on Grime guys dominating the charts with watered down material. Pure 140bpm vibes make up CBTS, with production provided by the likes of Z Dot, Rude Kid, and Nocturnal as well as bringing along a number of guests including fellow east Londoners Griminal, Devlin, and [[Maxsta]] among others to help out. On 13 March Ghetts won an OMA (Official Mixtape Award)for his mixtape, The Calm Before The Storm. He is also featured on a track called "On A Mission" with [[Dot Rotten]] and Opium on [[Mumzy Stranger]]'s mixtape ''[[List of songs recorded by Mumzy Stranger#No Stranger To This - Hosted by DJ Limelight (2010)|No Stranger To This]]''.

===2011–2012: Non-album projects===
Ghetto's "Sing For Me (Electro Remix)"; produced by Rude Kid had attention from the mainstream market. The single was signed by [[All Around the World Productions]], who specialise in [[electronic dance music]] and were home to acts such as [[N-Dubz]] and [[Cascada]]. On 21 February 2011, [[GRM Daily|Grime Daily]] uploaded the official video of a song titled "Who's on the Panel". The song is directed at the [[MTV Base]] panel who presented the "Best of the Best: UK MCs 2010" show on Sunday, 20 February 2011.<ref>[http://www.mtv.co.uk/shows/best-of-the-best-uk-mcs-2010/news/258028-mtv-presents-best-of-the-best-uk-mcs-2010 MTV Presents Best Of The Best: UK MCs 2010] on MTV.co.uk</ref> Ghetts was not in the list, and "vowed to make a track sending for the panel who cast the list and also vowed to shoot a video and have it on [[YouTube]] in the morning."<ref>[http://truetosound.net/videos/8798-ghetts-whos-on-the-panel/ Ghetts – 'Who's on the Panel?'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110415003111/http://truetosound.net/videos/8798-ghetts-whos-on-the-panel/ |date=15 April 2011 }} on TrueToSound.net</ref> The song and video was finished the next day, premiering on [[Kiss 100]] the day before the video upload. On 25 February 2011, the song was made available to download on [[iTunes]], along with another song titled "I Told Ya" featuring Rapid – which also had a video shot and uploaded by GrimeDaily on 24 February 2011.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_ti9TA4oEs GHETTS FEAT RAPID – I TOLD YA &#91;OFFICIAL VIDEO&#93;] by Grime Daily's official YouTube channel.</ref> Ghetts collaborated with [[Cher Lloyd]] on her record "Dub on the Track" in 2011. He featured on [[Clement Marfo & The Frontline]]'s single "Overtime". He released the single "On A Level" in late 2011. The official remix features [[Scorcher (rapper)|Scorcher]], Kano, and [[Wretch 32]].

===2010–2014: ''Rebel with a Cause''===
Ghetts' long-awaited debut album ''Rebel with a Cause'' was released on 10 March 2014 on the independent label Disrupt.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Rebel-With-A-Cause-Ghetts/dp/B00I480Q2C|title=Rebel with a Cause|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|date=10 March 2014}}</ref> The album campaign started with a spoken word video "Definition of a rebel", followed by the non-album single "The Cypher" which was released on 28 July 2013 and features all personas and elements of Ghetts' personality. The track peaked at number 9 in the iTunes hip-hop charts. The album's lead single "Rebel" became available to download when you pre-order the album from 2 February onwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/i-d-online-1/track-premiere-ghetts-rebel|title=Track Premiere: Ghetts – Rebel|publisher=[[SoundCloud]]|date=2 February 2014}}</ref>

On 19 September, US singer [[Chris Brown]] co-signed East London MC Ghetts and shared the video for his track "Feel Inside" declaring "What Ya'll Think?'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://grmdaily.com/chris-brown-is-a-fan-of-ghetts/|title=Chris Brown is a fan of Ghetts!?|work=GRM Daily}}</ref>

Ghetts had reportedly recorded more than 150 songs for the album (with some footage of his demos found on YouTube). Release dates for ''Rebel with a Cause'' dated back from 2010; reportedly, it was meant to have been released after his mixtape ''The Calm Before The Storm''. Unknown to many, the album was originally called ''The Justifications of J. Clarke'', but in a 2010 interview with [[SBTV]], he stated that he wasn't ready to have made an album of that manner.

===2018: ''Ghetto Gospel: The New Testament''===
On 30 August 2018, Ghetts officially announced the follow-up to his 2007 release ''Ghetto Gospel'', titled ''Ghetto Gospel: The New Testament'', was due for release on 14 September 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/08/ghetts-black-rose-feat-kojey-radical|title=Ghetts Announces 'Ghetto Gospel: The New Testament' With Kojey Radical-Assisted "Black Rose"|website=Complex|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref> Along with the album announcement, Ghetts shared the first single from the album, "Black Rose" featuring [[Kojey Radical]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/videos/ghetts-focusses-on-fatherhood-with-black-rose|title=Ghetts Focuses On Fatherhood With 'Black Rose'|work=Clash Magazine|access-date=11 September 2018}}</ref> The album featured artists including President T, Wretch 32, [[Donae'o]], [[Jordy (singer)|Jordy]], Suspect, [[Little Simz]], [[Stefflon Don]], [[Chip (rapper)|Chip]], Kojey Radical, and many more.

Ghetts also made singles after this album, including "Listen" (which was featured on the TV series ''[[Top Boy]]'' and made it onto the series' official album), "Drill Work" (produced by Swindle and is featured on Swindles' album ''No More Normal''), "Bad After We" (with Kojey Radical & [[Shy FX]] which features on Shy FX's album ''Raggamuffin Sound Tape''), and "Legends Don't Die" (honouring the deaths of artists involved in the grime scene; Stormin, [[Cadet (rapper)|Cadet]], [[Joshua Ribera|Depzman]], and Esco).

===2021: ''Conflict of Interest''===
On 19 February 2021, Ghetts released his third studio album ''Conflict of Interest''. Backed by Warner Music,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Lavin |first1=Will |title=Ghetts: 'There were definitely times when I could have thrown it all away' |url=https://www.nme.com/features/music-interviews/ghetts-conflict-of-interest-new-album-2880759 |website=NME.com |access-date=10 June 2021}}</ref> the album campaign involved the rollout of singles featuring other artists like Stormzy, Jaykae, Backroad Gee and Pa Salieu.
