On November 29, 2018, it was announced that [[Universal Pictures]] and Platt's father, [[Marc Platt (producer)|Marc Platt]], secured the film rights to ''Dear Evan Hansen''.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Busch|first1=Anita|date=November 29, 2018|title=Tony Award-Winning Musical 'Dear Evan Hansen' Will Be Universal Pictures, Marc Platt Film; 'Wonder's Stephen Chbosky May Direct|url=https://deadline.com/2018/11/dear-evan-hansen-film-tony-award-winning-musical-wonder-stephen-chbosky-marc-platt-1202222391/|access-date=February 14, 2019}}</ref> On June 18, 2020, Platt confirmed that he was set to reprise his role as Evan Hansen in the [[Dear Evan Hansen (film)|film]], which would be directed by [[Stephen Chbosky]] from a screenplay by Levenson.

Platt, however, dismissed the response, comparing his age to those of actors who played high school students in the 1978 film ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gurley|first=Alex|date=May 18, 2021|title=The Trailer For The "Dear Evan Hansen" Movie Just Dropped, And I Just Want To Know Who Thought Ben Platt Could Pass For A High Schooler|work=[[BuzzFeed]]|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alexgurley/dear-evan-hansen-trailer-reactions|accessdate=May 19, 2021}}</ref> On August 8, 2021, the criticism against the casting went even further, with emerging claims that [[nepotism]] was involved in the decision. In an interview with Zach Sang on his YouTube talk show, Platt said "I think the reaction is largely from people who don’t understand the context of the piece — the fact that I created the role and workshopped it for three years ... Were I not to do the movie, it probably wouldn’t get made. And so, I think, my defensive response is to want to go onto Twitter and be like, 'F you, guys. You don’t even know that this wouldn’t exist without me.' Of course, that's not true entirely and not my place to say. All I have to do is let the work speak for itself."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Schocket|first=Ryan|title=Ben Platt Is Facing Backlash Over His Latest Comments About The "Dear Evan Hansen" Film|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/ryanschocket2/ben-platt-defends-dear-evan-hansen-casting|access-date=2021-09-24|website=BuzzFeed|language=en}}</ref>
