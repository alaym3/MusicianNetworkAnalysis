==History==

He has previously described his sound as "dreamy back rub house."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.lessthan3.com/2014/12/interview-lane-8/|title=Interview: Lane 8|work=LessThan3}}</ref> 


In 2016, Lane 8 founded the record label [https://thisneverhappenedlabel.bandcamp.com/ This Never Happened].
