'''Gerard Thomas McMahon''', also known as '''Gerard McMann''' and '''G Tom Mac''', is an English singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and producer who specialises in creating music for films and TV.

Whilst McMahon has undertaken many different musical projects throughout his career, he is probably still best known by many for the [[gothic rock]] anthem "[[Cry Little Sister]]", a song which he recorded in 1987 for the soundtrack album of the cult horror film ''[[The Lost Boys]]''.

==Early years==
Gerard McMahon, who lists amongst his musical influences [[Liam Mullen]], [[John Lennon]], [[Stevie Wonder]] and [[Stravinsky]], emigrated with his family from England to America when he was 11 years of age. Initially moving to New York City, a few years later the MacMahons moved again, eventually settling in [[Wichita, Kansas]].

 }}
McMahon was only 16 years of age at the time. Despite his young age, McMahon, together with his band, The Strangers, recorded one single ("Don't Ever Leave Me") before disbanding.

After The Strangers disbanded, McMahon moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]] and took a job arranging classes at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University]].<ref name="KISS">{{cite web|url=http://www.kissfaq.com/articles/mcmahon.html|title="''Is That You?''" song-writer|access-date=25 March 2008|publisher=www.kissfaq.com|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130127044713/http://www.kissfaq.com/articles/mcmahon.html|archive-date=27 January 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 1971 however, McMahon moved to New York to pursue a performing career. His first gigs were playing bass and guitar in [[R&B]] bands in [[Harlem]].<ref name=" GM"/> However, being a versatile multi-instrumentalist, McMahon was soon receiving additional offers of work as a [[session musician]]. It was in this capacity that he provided backing vocals at [[Electric Lady Studios]] in New York, on the last [[Zephyr (band)|Zephyr]] album to feature wunderkind guitarist [[Tommy Bolin]] – ''Going Back to Colorado''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r53197|pure_url=yes}} ''Going Back to Colorado'' album credits]. www.allmusic.com.

In addition to gigging and studio session work, McMahon also became involved around this time in creating music for TV [[commercials]]. He also created a number of scores for [[Public Broadcasting Service]] projects.<ref name="BOOK">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=10eRzwLWOEwC&q=mcmahon&pg=PA1987|title= Brown, G., ''Colorado Rocks!: A Half-Century of Music in Colorado''|year= 2004|access-date=25 March 2008|publisher=Pruett Publishing, 2004|isbn= 9780871089304}}</ref>

McMahon spent 1972 living in Los Angeles, where his experience of studio and production work quickly established him a well-respected member of the city's music scene. Soon he was to be found playing bass with [[Jackson Browne]]'s touring band. It wasn't too long however before McMahon concluded that it would be more rewarding to promote his own solo career and headed back to Colorado.

After returning to Boulder, McMahon got together with a group of ten studio musicians and fronted what was to become a popular rock band in Colorado at the time – Gerard.<ref name="BOOK"/>

Having much admiration for McMahon and his band, [[Jim Guercio|Guercio]] offered the band a deal to record an album at his newly built [[Caribou Ranch]], a popular recording studio subsequently favoured by many prominent artists.

The resultant album, produced by Guercio himself, was the appropriately titled ''[[Gerard (album)|Gerard]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r173253|pure_url=yes}} ''Gerard'' album]. www.allmusic.com. Retrieved on 25 March 2008</ref> It was released in 1976 on Guercio's [[Caribou Records]] label. There did, however, seem to be one downside to this union, seemingly echoed in McMahon's frustration with the music press at that time, in so far as every review of Gerard's album, an album for which he had written twelve original songs, compared his music to that of [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]]'s.<ref name="BOOK"/> Although the album did well, it never broke nationally.<ref name="BOOK"/> The lead-off single, "Hello Operator" (b/w "Who's Your Daddy-O?"), failed to hit Billboard's Hot 100 chart, getting as high as No. 109 on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.zeppelindiscos.com/catalogo/detalle.php?id=32829 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 January 2014 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140130175400/http://www.zeppelindiscos.com/catalogo/detalle.php?id=32829 |archive-date=30 January 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second single, "Good Yankee Boy", was released as a promo-only single, and garnered only moderate radio airplay in 1976.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/zs89015|title=Gerard - Good Yankee Boy [Stereo]|accessdate=13 February 2021|website=45cat.com}}</ref>

The next three years saw McMahon again partaking in a number of different musical projects and continuing to lend his services as a session musician.

==1980 – 1999==
McMahon's song "Is That You?" was the first track on [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]' ''[[Unmasked (Kiss album)|Unmasked]]'' (1980).

Encouraged by [[Billy Joel]]'s former manager Irwin Mazur, in 1980 McMahon decided to promote his own recording career. He assembled a group of accomplished musicians – [[Gary Mallaber]], John Massaro, Kenny Lewis and two of the musicians he had engaged for Gerard, guitarist Steve Sykes and keyboard player [[Al Campbell (keyboard player)|Al Campbell]] – collectively called Kid Lightning, returned to the studio and recorded the album ''[[Blue Rue]]''.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r173253|pure_url=yes}} ''Gerard'' album credits]. www.allmusic.com. Retrieved on 25 March 2008</ref>{{failed verification|date=January 2013}} After the album was completed, McMahon's band was dropped from [[Columbia Records]].

Invited to Los Angeles by [[Warner Bros.

McMahon is known to have said that writing songs for films and TV shows was a "great new creative outlet"<ref name="MELODIC">{{cite web|url= http://www.melodic.net/interviewsOne.asp?interviewId=130|title=Whatever happened to….Gerard McMahon?|access-date=26 March 2008 |publisher=www.melodic.net}}</ref>

During the '80s, McMahon wrote songs for such films as ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'', ''[[Spring Break (film)|Spring Break]]'', ''[[All the Right Moves (film)|All the Right Moves]]'', ''[[The Lonely Guy]]'', ''[[Grandview, U.S.A.]]'' and ''[[Hardbodies]]'', among others.

McMahon's next album, ''[[No Looking Back (album)|No Looking Back]]'' was released by Warner Bros. in 1983, after which McMahon signed with the [[Atlantic Records]] label and in 1986 released ''[[Foreign Papers]]''.

McMahon scored a hit in 1986 with "[[Cry Little Sister]]".

==G TOM MAC==
McMahon recorded another album 2000 for Edge Artists.<ref>[http://wizardofdigi.com/search.php?search_table=song&genre=0&artist=0&instrument=0&composer=8&keyword=0&action=search EdgeSongs, Song Catalog] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718071136/http://wizardofdigi.com/search.php?search_table=song&genre=0&artist=0&instrument=0&composer=8&keyword=0&action=search |date=18 July 2011 }}. wizardofdigi.com. Retrieved on 29 March 2008</ref> To record and promote the album, McMahon formed a new band, G TOM MAC, with bassist, songwriter and co-producer Anthony Silver.

McMahon and Silver added Rodney "Cortada" Alejandro on keyboards, drummer Rob Ladd (from the band The Pressure Boys), Willy Aron (lead guitar) and [[Brie Howard|Brie Darling]] (from the band [[Boxing Gandhis]]) on backing vocals and percussion for live performances.<ref name="MELODIC"/>

In 2004 McMahon wrote the music and Eddie Kislinger wrote the lyrics for "Wicked Town", "Drop Dead Pretty", and "Was It Magic" for "[[Witchblade The Music]]", an Edge Artists soundtrack of songs from or inspired by the "Witchblade" TV series. McMahon and Kislinger are credited as Executive Producers. In 2012 the CW used "Wicked Town" in its trailer promoting "[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]" TV series. Edge Artists posted McMahon's performance of "Wicked Town" and "Was It Magic" on YouTube.

The band planned a 2008 tour to promote their second album, ''[[Thou Shalt Not Fall]]'' (2007).

==Pseudonyms==
Since McMahon has been known under a number of different names, much confusion has arisen over the years about his identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jerryosborne.com/10-10-05.htm|title=Mr.Music|access-date=31 March 2008|publisher=www.jerryosborne.com}}</ref>

The first pseudonym McMahon adopted, 'Gerard McMann', was just prior to the release of his album ''Foreign Papers'' in 1986. Of this he is reported to have said: 
{{quote
 |text= "When I would go out and do interviews on the radio or TV, it seems everybody was pronouncing my name in many different ways, except the correct way. So I thought it would make more sense to spell it out the way that is it pronounced."
 |sign= Gerard McMahon<ref name="MELODIC"/>}}
"Cry Little Sister", the song McMahon performed in 1987 for the [[The Lost Boys (soundtrack)|soundtrack of the film]] ''The Lost Boys'' was therefore credited to Gerard McMann.

When his father died, he reverted to McMahon.<ref name="MELODIC"/>

However, since forming G Tom Mac, "Gerard Thomas MacMahon" (the correct Irish spelling of McMahon) has become known to his new audience as 'G Tom Mac'. He is also known to use this name professionally. Consequently, most of the writing and performance credits since G Tom Mac was formed in 2000 are often to be found listed under this name.

McMahon is sometimes also referred to as ''"G"'', a nickname given to him by his friend Roger Daltrey.<ref name="MELODIC"/>
