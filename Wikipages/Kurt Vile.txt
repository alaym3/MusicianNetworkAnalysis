Focusing on his solo career, Vile released two albums, ''[[Constant Hitmaker]]'' (2008) and ''[[God Is Saying This to You...]]'' (2009), compiling various home recordings dating back to 2003.

==Biography==
===Beginnings (1994–2002)===
Vile grew up in [[Lansdowne, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Philadelphia]], and is the third oldest of ten children born to Charles and Donna Vile.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bevan|first1=David|title=Kurt Vile: Lost in the Stars?|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/06/kurt-vile-interview-lost-in-the-stars/|website=Spin|access-date=15 October 2017|date=18 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="nytvile">{{cite web|last1=WEINER|first1=JONAH|title=Kurt Vile: Classic Rock Meets Indie in the Ether|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/25/arts/music/25wein.html|website=The New York Times|access-date=15 October 2017|date=22 October 2009}}</ref> Although his surname is occasionally assumed to be a pseudonym and a pun on German composer [[Kurt Weill]], it is his real birth name and the similarity to Weill's name is a coincidence.<ref name="nytvile"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Fucked Up and Kurt Vile|url=http://www.citybeat.com/music/article/13015202/fucked-up-and-kurt-vile|website=CityBeat Cincinnati|access-date=15 October 2017|language=en}}</ref>

At the age of fourteen, Kurt Vile was given a [[banjo]] by his father, with Vile noting, "I kind of wished [it] was a guitar. So I'd kind of just play it like a guitar anyway. I was really into writing pretty primitive tunes, and really into recording. I pretty much knew I was going to do music [with my life] then."<ref name="carew1">{{cite web|url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/interviews/a/kurtvile.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160216004725/http://altmusic.about.com/od/interviews/a/kurtvile.htm|title=An Interview with Kurt Vile|first=Anthony|last=Carew|work=altmusic.about.com|date=September 29, 2009|archive-date=February 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Vile began writing songs on the banjo, describing his first self-penned track as: "a joke song. It was a good instrumental; I knew all these chords, but then I was quoting a [[cartoon]] as the lyrics on top of it. I had seen this cartoon about [[Superman]] and [[Lex Luthor]]; it was like the back history of why Lex Luthor hated Superman. They used to be friends, and then some giant stone of kryptonite fell and it made Lex Luthor's hair fall out, and he was like, 'You made all my hair fall out!' It was a really stupid cartoon, but that was my song, 'You Made All My Hair Fall Out'."<ref name="village">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/03/qa_kurt_vile_on.php|title=Q&A: Kurt Vile on His Favorite Bob Seger Song and the Neil Young Solo That Changed His Life|first=Jayson|last=Greene|work=villagevoice.com|access-date=24 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502090417/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/03/qa_kurt_vile_on.php|archive-date=2 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Three years later, Vile created his first "mass-produced" tape at the age of seventeen. Influenced by [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Beck]], [[Bill Callahan (musician)|Smog]] and the record label, [[Drag City (record label)|Drag City]], Vile noted, "I really thought I could be on Drag City. I really wanted that. I heard these people that made good music but it was still pretty raw, and had this real cult quality."<ref name="carew1" />

While working on his home recordings, Vile worked as a [[forklift]] driver, from 2000 to 2002.<ref name="steeply1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/kurt-vile|title=Interview: Kurt Vile|first=M. Hugh|last=Steeply|work=tinymixtapes.com|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> Regarding this time in his life, Vile noted "It was a really fast-paced job, unloading trucks. Though music was my passion, I had a long way to go then and a lot to learn. I got depressed so many times by my [[blue-collar]] life, and self-conscious about the fact that I didn't go to college. I was always working super low-end jobs, being the complete opposite of what I wanted to be. But I just fell into it, and I was also sorta shy. It was definitely a pretty rough time."<ref>{{cite news |author-link=Laura Barton |last=Barton |first=Laura |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/29/kurt-vile-wakin-pretty-daze |title=Kurt Vile: from Boston forklift driver to the Hotel California |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=March 29, 2013 |access-date=2021-05-06 |location=London}}</ref>

===The War on Drugs and ''Constant Hitmaker'' (2003–2008)===
In 2003, after staying in [[Boston]] for two years, Vile moved back to [[Philadelphia]], and began collaborating with musician and songwriter [[Adam Granduciel]]. The duo subsequently formed the [[indie rock]] band [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War on Drugs]] in 2005. Regarding his friendship with Granduciel, Vile noted, "We're essentially best friends. He was backing me up in my band when he started working on his own music, so I thought I’d return the favor."<ref name="carew1" /> Granduciel and Vile released their debut studio album, ''[[Wagonwheel Blues]]'', in 2008 and embarked on a tour in support of its release.<ref>{{Cite web|title=The War On Drugs – Wagonwheel Blues|url=http://www.discogs.com/War-On-Drugs-Wagonwheel-Blues/release/1614117|website=Discogs|access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref>

At this time, Vile's debut solo album, ''[[Constant Hitmaker]]'' (2008), was released on [[Gulcher Records]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kurt Vile – Constant Hitmaker|url=http://www.discogs.com/Kurt-Vile-Constant-Hitmaker/release/1936606|website=Discogs|access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref> Vile subsequently decided to leave The War on Drugs to concentrate on his solo career. The album was compiled from various home recordings and one studio recording of the song "Freeway".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kurt Vile: No, Don't Bring Me Weed|url=http://larecord.com/interviews/2009/03/16/kurt-vile-no-dont-bring-me-weed|website=larecord.com|access-date = 2016-01-30|date=March 16, 2009|first=Sarah|last=McKay}}</ref> In 2009, Vile noted, "The War On Drugs got put out on a bigger label first, so, in the [[blog]]osphere, some claim that The War on Drugs was my first, main band. But that's just the way it looks. I've made more music than Adam has, and have been doing my Kurt Vile thing for a little bit longer. And ''Constant Hitmaker'' came out around that same time. Right when that [War on Drugs] record came out, I went to Europe with them, and also opened as Kurt Vile. That was right when I decided I wanted to concentrate on doing my own thing."<ref name="carew1" /> Despite Vile's departure, Granduciel remained a member of his backing band, The Violators, with Granduciel noting, "There was never, despite what lazy journalists have assumed, any sort of falling out, or resentment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07573-war-on-drugs-slave-ambient-interview|title=Sincerely Ambient: An Interview with The War on Drugs|first=Charles|last=Ubaghs|work=thequietus.com|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>

===''God Is Saying This to You...'' and ''Childish Prodigy'' (2009–2010)===
In April 2009, [[Mexican Summer]] released ''[[God Is Saying This to You...]]''; a collection of Vile's home recordings dating back to 2003 on vinyl only.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kurt Vile – God Is Saying This To You...|url=http://www.discogs.com/Kurt-Vile-God-Is-Saying-This-To-You/release/1697645|website=Discogs|access-date = 2016-01-30}}</ref> Upon its release, Vile had already recorded a studio album, ''[[Childish Prodigy]]'', which Vile described as "definitely not as [[lo-fi]]" as his previous releases.<ref name="steeply1" /> After shipping the record to various labels, Vile signed with [[Matador Records]] in May 2009. Vile noted, "It's a perfect fit. They were my number one choice. I don't really consider my music [[indie rock]] or think that Matador cater only to indie rock, but I still feel I can relate most to Matador, more than any other label. Not to mention the fact that they are way on top of their shit."<ref name="steeply1" />

Recorded with backing band The Violators, ''Childish Prodigy'' was released on October 6, 2009, and increased Vile's exposure significantly. Support slots with [[Dinosaur Jr]], [[Thurston Moore]] and [[Fucked Up]] followed the album's release. Regarding his new position, Vile stated, "Obviously there's more touring, more press and more hype which I won't say is not deserved. There's like a faction of people, too, who like to talk shit, which is kind of new. When I was more independent, there were people who got really excited and there still are but once I got more press people started to comment on blogs. People like to talk shit. [...] It's like climbing a ladder. I like to climb it really slowly. I could probably get really professional right away, but I like to take baby steps and find my own way."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/philadelphias-kurt-vile-writes-hits-takes-shit,34912/|title=Philadelphia's Kurt Vile writes hits, takes shit|first=Maggie|last=Serota|work=avclub.com|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>

===''Smoke Ring for My Halo'' (2011–2012)===
Vile released his fourth studio album, ''[[Smoke Ring for My Halo]]'', in 2011. The album peaked at #154 on the ''[[Billboard Top 200]]'' and placed highly on many end-of-year lists, and in 2013 was named at number 475 in NME's '500 Greatest Albums of All Time'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/the-500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-500-401-1426363|title=The 500 Greatest Albums Of All Time: 500-401 - NME|date=21 October 2013|website=Nme.com|access-date=12 October 2018}}</ref> Later in 2011, Vile released a companion EP, ''[[So Outta Reach]]'', and appeared on his former band [[The War on Drugs (band)|The War on Drugs]]' second studio album, ''[[Slave Ambient]]''. Shortly after the release of ''Smoke Ring for My Halo'', longtime Violators guitarist [[Adam Granduciel]] departed from the band to fully focus on The War on Drugs, with Vile noting, "Adam, he plays in The War on Drugs, his record came out a little after mine did, so at first he toured, and now he's obviously busy with that and now he's working on his new record."

===''Wakin on a Pretty Daze'' (2013–2014)===
''[[Wakin on a Pretty Daze]]'' was released on April 9, 2013. Regarding the current line-up of his backing band, Vile noted, "I’m playing with Jesse [Trbovich] and Rob [Laakso]. [...] Rob Laakso is the newest member and Jesse has been a member forever. They’re steady members. Our drummer is no longer with us, but other than that, different friends played drums on the record and we’re doing rehearsals with that right now. But other than that, the Violators are me, Jesse, and Rob and we’ll see how it evolves."<ref name="Rachel">{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/1270661/progress-report-kurt-vile/franchises/progress-report/|title=Progress Report:Kurt Vile|first=T.

[[Steve Gunn (musician)|Steve Gunn]] joined the band as an "auxiliary Violator", during the band's May 2013 tour dates, with Vile noting, "It's impossible to just talk about Steve. He's too good! He's so good; just listen to him. What can I even say about him that touches that? I just want to listen to him."<ref name="paradiseofbachelors.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.paradiseofbachelors.com/steve-gunns-time-off-set-for-june-18-release-steve-to-tour-with-kurt-vile|title=Steve Gunn's Time Off set for June 18 release; Steve to tour with Kurt Vile.|publisher=Paradise of Bachelors|date=2013-04-04|access-date=2013-05-12}}</ref>
