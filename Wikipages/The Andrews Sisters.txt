'''The Andrews Sisters''' were an American [[close harmony]] singing group of the [[Swing music|swing]] and [[boogie-woogie]] eras. The group consisted of three sisters: [[contralto]] '''LaVerne Sophia''' (July 6, 1911 – May 8, 1967), [[soprano]] '''Maxene Anglyn''' (January 3, 1916 – October 21, 1995), and [[mezzo-soprano]] '''Patricia "Patty" Marie''' (February 16, 1918 – January 30, 2013).<ref name=foxnews>{{cite web |url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/01/30/last-surviving-andrews-sisters-member-patty-andrews-dies-at-4/?test=latestnews |title=Last surviving Andrews Sisters member Patty Andrews dies at 94 |publisher=Fox News |date=January 30, 2013 |access-date=July 2, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130618104841/http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/01/30/last-surviving-andrews-sisters-member-patty-andrews-dies-at-4/?test=latestnews |archive-date=June 18, 2013}}</ref> The sisters have sold an estimated 80 million records.<ref>{{cite news |title=Patty Andrews of Andrews Sisters Dead at 94 |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1536347/patty-andrews-of-andrews-sisters-dead-at-94 |newspaper=Billboard |date=January 30, 2013 |access-date=September 21, 2020}}</ref> Their 1941 hit "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]" can be considered an early example of [[jump blues]]. Other songs closely associated with the Andrews Sisters include their first major hit, "[[Bei Mir Bistu Shein|Bei Mir Bist Du Schön (Means That You're Grand)]]" (1937), "[[Beer Barrel Polka]] (Roll Out the Barrel)" (1939), "[[Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar]]" (1940), "[[Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me)]]" (1942), and "[[Rum and Coca Cola]]" (1945), which helped introduce American audiences to [[calypso music|calypso]].

The Andrews Sisters' harmonies and songs are still influential today, and have been copied and recorded by entertainers such as [[Patti Page]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Pentatonix]], and others. The group was among the inaugural inductees to the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] upon its opening in 1998.<ref name="VocalGroupHallofFame">{{cite web | url=http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/andrews_sisters.htm | title=Vocal Group Hall of Fame – The Andrews Sisters | access-date=January 31, 2013 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522062330/http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/andrews_sisters.htm | archive-date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> Writing for ''Bloomberg'', Mark Schoifet said the sisters became the most popular female vocal group of the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Schoifet |first1=Mark |title=Patty Andrews, Last Survivor of Wartime Sister Trio, Dies at 94 |url=https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kFXJc6hMCdIJ:https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-01-30/patty-andrews-last-survivor-of-wartime-sister-trio-dies-at-94+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us&client=firefox-b-1-e |access-date=August 20, 2019 |publisher=Bloomberg |date=January 30, 2013}}</ref> They are still widely acclaimed today for their famous close harmonies.

== Early life ==
The sisters were born to Olga "Ollie" (née Sollie) and Peter Andreas. Mr. Andreas (later 'Andrews') was [[Greeks|Greek]] and his wife was of [[Norwegian-American|Norwegian]] ancestry raised in the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] faith. The Sollie family disapproved of Olga's marriage, but the relationship was repaired once their first child, LaVerne, was born July 6, 1911. Their second daughter, Anglyn, died at eight months of age on March 16, 1914. Maxene arrived on January 3, 1916, and Patty was born February 16, 1918.

Patty, the youngest and the [[lead singer]] of the group, was 7 when the group was formed, and 12 when they won first prize at a talent contest at the local [[Orpheum Theatre (Minneapolis)|Orpheum Theatre]] in [[Minneapolis]], where LaVerne played piano accompaniment for the [[silent film]] showings in exchange for dancing lessons for herself and her sisters. Following the collapse of their father's Minneapolis restaurant, the sisters went on the road to support the family.<ref name="startribune">{{cite web|agency=Associated Press file photo|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/189120371.html|title=Patty Andrews, last of the famed sisters, dies|publisher=StarTribune.com|access-date=July 2, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207043301/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/189120371.html|archive-date=February 7, 2013}}</ref> All three attended Franklin Junior High School and North High School, both in Minneapolis.<ref>Minneapolis Tribune, October 9, 1938, pg 21.

Instrumental to the sisters' success over the years were their parents, Olga and Peter, their orchestra leader and musical arranger, [[Vic Schoen]] (1916–2000), and [[Kapp Records|Jack and David Kapp]], who founded Decca Records.

=== World War II ===
[[File:Apple Tree Andrews Sisters.jpg|thumbnail|The Andrews Sisters singing 'Don't Sit Under The Apple Tree (With Anyone Else But Me)' in the 1942 film ''[[Private Buckaroo]]''.]]
In the years just before and during [[World War II]], the Andrews Sisters were at the height of their popularity, and the group still tends to be associated in the public's mind with the war years. They had numerous hit records during these years, both on their own and in collaboration with [[Bing Crosby]]. Some of these hits had service or military related themes, including "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]", "Three Little Sisters", "[[Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me)]]", "[[Hot time in the town of Berlin: when the Yanks go marching in|A Hot Time In the Town of Berlin]]" and "[[Rum and Coca Cola]]". The sisters performed their hits in service comedy films like ''[[Buck Privates]]'' and ''[[Private Buckaroo]]''.

During the war, they entertained the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces extensively in Africa, and [[Italy]], as well as in the U.S., visiting [[United States Army|Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], [[United States Marines|Marine]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] bases, war zones, [[hospitals]], and munitions factories.<ref>Andrews, Maxene and Bill Gilbert. ''Over Here, Over There: The Andrews Sisters and the USO Stars in World War II''. New York: Kensington Publishing Corp, 1993.</ref> They encouraged U.S. citizens to purchase [[War bonds#Second World War|war bonds]] with their rendition of [[Irving Berlin]]'s song "[[Any Bonds Today#Performances|Any Bonds Today?]]". They also helped actress [[Bette Davis]] and actor [[John Garfield]] found [[California]]'s famous [[Hollywood Canteen]], a welcome retreat for [[Soldier|servicemen]] where the trio often performed, volunteering their personal time to sing and dance for the soldiers, sailors, and Marines (they did the same at [[New York City]]'s [[Stage Door Canteen]] during the war).

While touring, they often treated three random servicemen to dinner when they were dining out. They recorded a series of Victory Discs ([[V-Discs]]) for distribution to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] fighting forces only, again volunteering their time for studio sessions for the Music Branch, Special Service Division, of the Army Service Forces, and they were dubbed the "Sweethearts of the [[Armed Forces Radio Service]]" for their many appearances on shows such as "Command Performance", "[[Mail Call (radio program)|Mail Call]]", and "[[G.I. (military)|G.I.]] Journal."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-30/local/36647222_1_boswell-sisters-sister-act-andrews-sisters|title=Patty Andrews, the last surviving member of the Andrews Sisters, dies at 94|first=Adam|last=Bernstein|work=Washington Post|date=January 30, 2013|access-date=February 3, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203105229/http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-01-30/local/36647222_1_boswell-sisters-sister-act-andrews-sisters|archive-date=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

The sisters' 1945 hit "[[Rum and Coca Cola]]" became one of their most popular and best-known recordings, but also inspired some controversy. Some radio stations were reluctant to play the record because it mentioned a commercial product by name, and because the lyrics were subtly suggestive of local women prostituting themselves to U.S. servicemen serving at the then naval base on [[Trinidad]]. The song was based on a Trinidadian [[calypso music|calypso]], and a dispute over its provenance led to a well-publicized court case.<ref name="cip.law.ucla.edu">{{Cite web |url=http://cip.law.ucla.edu/cases/case_baronfeist.html |title=Columbia Law School & UCLA LAW Copyright Infringement Project |access-date=October 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704224037/http://cip.law.ucla.edu/cases/case_baronfeist.html |archive-date=July 4, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>  The sisters later told biographers that they were asked to record the tune on short notice and were unaware either of the copyright issue or of the implications of the lyrics.<ref name="Sforza2015">{{cite book|last=Sforza|first=John|title=Swing It!: The Andrews Sisters Story|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqkeBgAAQBAJ&pg=PA76|year=2000|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-4897-7|page=76}}</ref>

Maxene and LaVerne tried to continue the act as a duo and met with good press during a 10-day tour of [[Australia]], but a reported [[suicide]] attempt by Maxene in December 1954<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/166728962 Los Angeles Times article] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) December 22, 1954.</ref> put a halt to any further tours (Maxene spent a short time in the hospital after swallowing 18 sleeping pills, an occurrence that LaVerne told reporters was an accident). Maxene and LaVerne did appear together on ''The Red Skelton Show'' on October 26, 1954, singing the humorous "Why Do They Give the Solos to Patty" as well as lip-synching "Beer Barrel Polka" with Skelton in drag filling in for Patty. This however did not sit well with Patty and a cease and desist order was sent to Skelton. The sisters' private relationship was often troubled and Patty blamed it on Maxene: "Ever since I was born, Maxene has been a problem, and that problem hasn't stopped," she said.<ref name="Eonline">{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/383541/patty-andrews-dies-singer-was-last-surviving-member-of-the-andrews-sisters|title=Patty Andrews Dies, Singer Was Last Surviving Member of the Andrews Sisters|first=Natalie|last=Finn|work=E Online.com|date=January 30, 2013|access-date=February 3, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203070622/http://www.eonline.com/news/383541/patty-andrews-dies-singer-was-last-surviving-member-of-the-andrews-sisters|archive-date=February 3, 2013}}</ref>

The trio reunited in 1956 and signed a new recording deal with [[Capitol Records]], for whom Patty was already a featured soloist. By this point however, rock-and-roll and [[doo-wop]] were dominating the charts and older artists were left by the wayside. The sisters recorded a dozen singles through 1959, some of which attempted to keep up with the times by incorporating rock sounds. None of these achieved any major success. In addition, they produced three [[hi-fi]] albums, including a vibrant [[LP album|LP]] of songs from the dancing 1920s with [[Billy May]]'s orchestra. In 1962, they signed with [[Dot Records]] and recorded a series of [[stereo]] albums until 1967, both re-recordings of earlier hits which incorporated up-to-date production techniques, as well as new material, including "[[I Left My Heart in San Francisco]]", "[[Still (Bill Anderson song)|Still]]", "[[The End of the World (Skeeter Davis song)|The End of the World]]", "[[Puff the Magic Dragon]]", "[[Sailor (song)|Sailor]]", "[[Satin Doll]]", "[[Mr. Bass Man]]", the theme from ''[[Come September]]'', and the theme from ''[[A Man and a Woman]]''. They toured extensively during the 1960s, favoring top nightclubs in [[Las Vegas]], [[California]], and [[London|London, England]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mE2-RxDyZsC&q=the+andrews+sisters+in+london&pg=PA328|title=The Andrews Sisters: A Biography and Career Record|first=H.

Eldest sister LaVerne died in 1967 at the age of 55 after a year-long bout with [[cancer]]<ref name="05091967 LA Times">[https://search.proquest.com/docview/155624739 Los Angeles Times article] ([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) May 9, 1967.</ref> during which she was replaced by singer Joyce DeYoung (May 24, 1926 – March 7, 2014). DeYoung fulfilled concert appearances, including an appearance on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' on November 30, 1967, but she did not record with Patty and Maxene. LaVerne had founded the original group, and often acted as the peacemaker among the three during the sisters' lives, more often siding with her parents, to whom the girls were extremely devoted, than with either of her sisters. Their last appearance together as a trio was on ''[[The Dean Martin Show]]'' on September 29, 1966.

After LaVerne died, Maxene and Patty continued to perform periodically until 1968, when Maxene became the Dean of Women at Tahoe Paradise College,<ref name="10081968 St Petersburg Times">{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cqJQAAAAIBAJ&pg=5642,6029172&dq=andrews+sisters&hl=en|title=St. Petersburg Times – Google News Archive Search|website=news.google.com|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref> teaching acting, drama, and speech at a [[Lake Tahoe]] college and working with troubled teens, and Patty was once again eager to be a [[Solo (music)|soloist]].<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hR0MAAAAIBAJ&sjid=u1wDAAAAIBAJ&dq=andrews%20sisters&pg=5682%2C6029193 St. Petersburg Times] August 10, 1968.</ref>

In 1969, Patty appeared in [[Lucille Ball]]'s third series ''[[Here's Lucy]]'', in the sixth episode of the second season, titled "Lucy and the Andrews Sisters". The episode has Patty enlisting the help of Lucy, her daughter Kim (played by [[Lucie Arnaz]]), and her son Craig ([[Desi Arnaz Jr.]]) to perform a medley of Andrews Sisters hits for the Andrews Sisters Fan Club reunion. Lucy played LaVerne, Kim (Lucie Arnaz) played Maxene, and Craig (Desi Arnaz, Jr.) played [[Bing Crosby]]. She also had a cameo as herself along with many other stars in the 1970 film ''[[The Phynx]]''.

=== Comeback ===
Patty and Maxene's careers experienced a resurgence when [[Bette Midler]] covered "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]" in 1973. The next year, the pair debuted on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in the [[Sherman Brothers]]' nostalgic [[World War II]] [[musical theatre|musical]]: ''[[Over Here!]]'', which premiered at the [[Shubert Theatre (Broadway)|Shubert Theatre]] to rave reviews. This was a follow-up to Patty's success in ''[[Victory Canteen]]'', a 1971 California revue. ''Over Here!'' starred Maxene and Patty (with [[Janie Sell]] filling in for LaVerne and winning a [[Tony Award]] for her performance) and was written with both sisters in mind for the leads. It launched the careers of many now notable theater, film, and television stars, including [[John Travolta]], [[Marilu Henner]], [[Treat Williams]], and [[Ann Reinking]]. It was the last major tour for the sisters and was cut short owing to a conflict with the show's producers over pay for the sisters, resulting in the cancellation of an extensively scheduled road tour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=cD9SAAAAIBAJ&pg=4875,1202172&dq=andrews+sisters&hl=en|title=Andrews Sisters in pay dispute|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=December 27, 1974|page=6–D}}</ref> ''Over'' ''Here!'' lasted only a year, and its end marked the last time the sisters would ever sing together.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Maxene Andrews, 79, of the Andrews Sisters|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/23/obituaries/maxene-andrews-79-of-the-andrews-sisters.html|newspaper = The New York Times|date = October 23, 1995|access-date = February 14, 2016|issn = 0362-4331|first = John S.|last = Wilson|url-status=live|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160205071549/http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/23/obituaries/maxene-andrews-79-of-the-andrews-sisters.html|archive-date = February 5, 2016}}</ref>

Patty continually distanced herself from Maxene, until her death, and would not explain her motives regarding the separation. Maxene appealed to Patty for a reunion, personally if not professionally, both in public and in private, but to no avail. Maxene suffered a serious [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] while performing in [[Illinois]] in 1982 and underwent [[quadruple bypass surgery]], from which she successfully recovered. Patty visited her sister while she was hospitalized. Now sometimes appearing as "Patti" (but still signing autographs as "Patty"), she re-emerged in the late 1970s as a regular panelist on ''[[The Gong Show]]''. Maxene had a successful comeback as a cabaret soloist in 1979 and toured worldwide for the next 15 years, recording a solo album in 1985 entitled "Maxene: An Andrews Sister" for Bainbridge Records. Patty started her own solo act in 1980, but did not receive the critical acclaim her sister had for her performances, even though Patty was considered to be the "star" of the group for years. The critics' major complaint was that Patty's show concentrated too much on Andrews Sisters material, which did not allow Patty's own talents as an expressive and bluesy vocalist to shine through.<ref name="Sforza">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqkeBgAAQBAJ&q=laverne+andrews+cremated&pg=PA154|title=Swing It!: The Andrews Sisters Story|first=John|last=Sforza|date=January 13, 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780813148977}}</ref>

The two sisters did reunite, albeit briefly, on October 1, 1987, when they received a star on Hollywood's [[Hollywood Walk of Fame|Walk of Fame]], even singing a few bars of "[[Beer Barrel Polka]]" for the ''[[Entertainment Tonight]]'' cameras. An earthquake shook the area that very morning and the ceremony was nearly cancelled, which caused Patty to joke, "Some people said that earthquake this morning was LaVerne because she couldn't be here, but really it was just Maxene and me on the telephone." Besides this, and a few brief private encounters, they remained somewhat estranged for their remaining years, with Maxene dying in 1995.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgtrCF00D8AC&q=patty+and+maxene+andrews+estranged&pg=PA321|title=Blind Journey: A Journalist's Memoirs|first=Jack|last=Hawn|date=October 1, 2010|publisher=Strategic Book Publishing|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9781609760113}}</ref>

Shortly after her [[Off-Broadway]] debut in [[New York City]] in a show called ''Swingtime Canteen'', Maxene suffered another heart attack and died at [[Cape Cod Hospital]] on October 21, 1995, making Patty the last surviving Andrews Sister. Not long before she died, Maxene told music historian William Ruhlmann,<blockquote>I have nothing to regret. We got on the carousel and we each got the ring and I was satisfied with that. There's nothing I would do to change things if I could...Yes, I would. I wish I had the ability and the power to bridge the gap between my relationship with my sister, Patty.<ref name="Swing It"/></blockquote>Upon hearing the news of her sister's death, Patty became distraught. Several days later, Patty's husband Wally fell down a flight of stairs and broke both wrists. Patty did not attend her sister's [[memorial service]]s in [[New York City]], nor in [[California]].{{citation needed|date = February 2013}} [[Bob Hope]] said of Maxene's passing, "She was more than part of The Andrews Sisters, much more than a singer. She was a warm and wonderful lady who shared her talent and wisdom with others."<ref name="Swing It">{{cite book |last=Sforza |first=John |title=Swing It!: The Andrews Sisters Story |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IPoMEFUgOwUC&pg=PA171|year=2004 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |location=United States of America |isbn=9780813190990|pages=171, 289}}</ref>

== Marriages, family, and deaths ==
LaVerne Andrews married Lou Rogers,<ref name="05091967 LA Times" /> a trumpet player in [[Vic Schoen]]'s band, in 1948. The two remained together until LaVerne's death from cancer on May 8, 1967, at the age of 55. Lou died in 1995.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9mE2-RxDyZsC&pg=PA409 | title = The Andrews Sisters: A Biography and Career Record | isbn = 9780786432608 | last1 = Arto Nimmo | first1 = H | year = 2004|page=409}}</ref> The ashes of LaVerne and Maxene Andrews are interred in the Columbarium of Memory of the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Glendale, California]],<ref name="Sforza"/> close to the ashes of their parents.

Maxene Andrews married music publisher [[Lou Levy (publisher)|Lou Levy]] in 1941, separating in 1949. They adopted a girl and a boy, Aleda Ann and Peter.<ref>{{Cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=9mE2-RxDyZsC&pg=PA409 | title = The Andrews Sisters: A Biography and Career Record | isbn = 9780786432608 | last1 = Arto Nimmo | first1 = H | year = 2004|page=4}}</ref> Levy was the sisters' manager from 1937 to 1951. Later in life, according to her adopted daughter, Maxene entered a thirteen-year relationship with her manager Lynda Wells and later spent many years as life partners. "To me, being gay was not a central focus of Maxene's life at all," Wells told radio station The Current ([[KCMP]]) in a 2019 interview.<ref name="thecurrent.org">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2019/06/05/the-current-rewind-andrews-sisters|title=The Current Rewind: The Andrews Sisters & Lynda Wells|website=www.thecurrent.org|access-date=June 7, 2019}}</ref> "Her art was. Her singing was." But Wells says that their status as companions, and Maxene's health issues as she got older, led Maxene to adopt her as a daughter. "There was no such thing as being married at that time," she said. "During her lifetime, there was no such thing that existed for us."<ref name="thecurrent.org"/> Maxene died October 21, 1995, at age 79.

Patty Andrews married agent [[Marty Melcher]] in 1947 but left him in 1949, when he pursued a romantic relationship with [[Doris Day]]. She then married Walter Weschler, the trio's pianist, in 1951. Patty died of natural causes at her home in [[Northridge, California]], on January 30, 2013, at the age of 94. Weschler, her husband of nearly 60 years, had died on August 28, 2010, at the age of 88.<ref name=startribune/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nwitimes.com/entertainment/columnists/offbeat/offbeat-singer-patty-andrews-manager-husband-dead-at-age/article_235eef80-ae3a-5e04-b86d-ff2a4936feae.html|title=OFFBEAT: Singer Patty Andrews manager husband dead at age 88|first=Philip|last=Potempa|website=nwitimes.com|access-date=May 2, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040025/http://www.nwitimes.com/entertainment/columnists/offbeat/offbeat-singer-patty-andrews-manager-husband-dead-at-age/article_235eef80-ae3a-5e04-b86d-ff2a4936feae.html|archive-date=December 1, 2017}}</ref>

== Legacy ==
The Andrews Sisters were the most imitated of all female singing groups and influenced many artists, including [[Mel Tormé]], [[Les Paul and Mary Ford]], [[the Four Freshmen]], [[the Supremes]], [[the Beach Boys]], [[the McGuire Sisters]], [[the Lennon Sisters]], [[the Pointer Sisters]], [[the Manhattan Transfer]], [[Barry Manilow]], and [[Bette Midler]].{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} [[Elvis Presley]] was a fan.{{citation needed|date=August 2021}} The imitation occurred internationally; the Harmony Sisters, a popular group that performed from the 1930s to the 1950s in [[Finland]] was one such singing group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2006/12/14/harmony-sisters-laulaa |title=Harmony Sisters laulaa |access-date=April 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110020853/http://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2006/12/14/harmony-sisters-laulaa |archive-date=January 10, 2017}} YLE – Finnish Broadcasting corporation</ref>

Most of the Andrews Sisters' music has been restored and released in [[compact disc]] form. Over 300 of their original Decca recordings, a good portion of which was hit material, has yet to be released by [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]]/Decca. Many of their Decca recordings have been used in such television shows and Hollywood movies as ''[[Homefront (U.S. TV series)|Homefront]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Agent Carter (TV series)|Agent Carter]]'', ''[[The Brink's Job]]'', ''[[National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation]]'', ''[[Swing Shift (film)|Swing Shift]]'', ''[[Raggedy Man]]'', ''[[Summer of '42]]'', ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five (film)|Slaughterhouse-Five]]'', ''[[Maria's Lovers]]'', ''[[Harlem Nights]]'', ''[[In Dreams (film)|In Dreams]]'', ''[[Murder in the First (film)|Murder in the First]]'', ''[[L.A.

Comical references to the trio in television [[sitcoms]] can be found as early as ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' and as recently as ''[[Everybody Loves Raymond]]''. In 2007, their version of "[[Bei Mir Bist Du Schön]]" was included in the game ''[[BioShock]]'', a first-person shooter that takes place in an [[alternate history]] 1960, and later in 2008, their song "Civilization" (with [[Danny Kaye]]) was included in the [[Atomic Age]]-inspired video game ''[[Fallout 3]].'' The 2010 video game ''[[Mafia II]]'' features numerous Andrews Sisters songs, with "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy", "Strip Polka" and "Rum And Coca-Cola". The 2011 video game ''[[L.A. Noire]]'' features the song "[[Pistol Packin' Mama]]", where the sisters perform a duet with [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uneKBnzr0-A|title=L A Noire OST Bing Crosby & The Andrews Sisters Pistol Packin Mama|last=Trent Rannells Sr.|date=January 24, 2013|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312084732/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uneKBnzr0-A|archive-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> The sisters were again featured in a ''Fallout'' game in 2015, when their songs "Pistol Packin' Mama" and "Civilization" were featured in the game ''[[Fallout 4]]''.

[[Christina Aguilera]] used the Andrews Sisters' "Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy" to inspire her song "[[Candyman (Christina Aguilera song)|Candyman]]" (released as a single in 2007) from her hit album ''[[Back to Basics (Christina Aguilera album)|Back to Basics]]''. The song was co-written by [[Linda Perry]]. The London-based trio the [[Puppini Sisters]] uses their style harmonies on several Andrews Sisters and other hits of the 1940s and 1950s as well as later [[rock music|rock]] and [[disco]] hits. The trio has said their name is a tribute to The Andrews Sisters. The National WW2 Museum's Victory Belles are proud to pay tribute to the Andrews Sisters performing their music daily in the Stage Door Canteen in [[New Orleans]]. The Manhattan Dolls, a New York City-based touring group, performs both the popular tunes sung by the Andrews Sisters and some of the more obscure tunes such as "Well Alright" and "South American Way".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Toplcxv-jpc|title=Flying Legends 2013 Clips featuring the Manhattan Dolls|last=WillzUK75|date=July 17, 2013|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themanhattandolls.com/WWII.html|title=The Manhattan Dolls|website=themanhattandolls.com|access-date=May 2, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160317222656/http://www.themanhattandolls.com/WWII.html|archive-date=March 17, 2016}}</ref>

In 2008 and 2009, the [[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] produced ''The Andrews Sisters: Queens of the Music Machines'', a one-hour documentary on the history of the Andrews Sisters from their upbringing to the present. The American premier of the show was June 21, 2009, in their summer vacation enclave of Mound, Minnesota. In 2008, Mound dedicated "The Andrews Sisters Trail". The sisters spent summers in Mound<ref name=foxnews/> with their uncles Pete and Ed Solie, who had a grocery store there. Maxene Andrews always said that the summers in Mound created a major sense of "normalcy" and "a wonderful childhood" in a life that otherwise centered on the sisters' careers. The Westonka Historical Society has a large collection of Andrews Sisters memorabilia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westonkahistoricalsociety.org/movestory.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130416030548/http://www.westonkahistoricalsociety.org/movestory.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 16, 2013|title=Westonka Historical Society|website=westonkahistoricalsociety.org|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref>

== Musical innovators ==
They found instant appeal with teenagers and young adults who were engrossed in the [[Swing music|swing]] and [[jazz]] idioms, especially when they performed with nearly all of the major [[big band]]s, including those led by [[Glenn Miller]], [[Benny Goodman]], [[Buddy Rich]], [[Tommy Dorsey]], [[Jimmy Dorsey]], [[Gene Krupa]], [[Joe Venuti]], [[Freddie Slack]], [[Eddie Heywood]], [[Bob Crosby]] (Bing's brother), [[Desi Arnaz]], [[Guy Lombardo]], [[Les Brown (bandleader)|Les Brown]], [[Bunny Berigan]], [[Xavier Cugat]], [[Paul Whiteman]], [[Ted Lewis (musician)|Ted Lewis]], [[Nelson Riddle]], and mood-master [[Gordon Jenkins]], whose orchestra and chorus accompanied them on such successful soft and melancholy renditions as "[[I Can Dream, Can't I]]?" (which shot to number one on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' and remained in the [[Top 40|Top 10]] for 25 weeks), "[[I Wanna Be Loved]]", "[[There Will Never Be Another You]]", and "[[The Three Bells]]", which was an English version of the French 1946 rendition by [[Édith Piaf]] & [[Les Compagnons de la chanson]]; along with several solo recordings with Patty, including a cover version of [[Nat King Cole]]'s "[[Too Young (popular song)|Too Young]]", "[[It Never Entered My Mind]]", "[[If You Go]]", and "That's How A Love Song Is Born".{{citation needed|date = February 2013}}

== Films ==
Patty, Maxene, and LaVerne appeared in 17 Hollywood films. Their first picture, ''[[Argentine Nights]]'', paired them with another enthusiastic trio, the [[Ritz Brothers]].<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/165092700 Los Angeles Times article] [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] May 15, 1940.</ref> [[Universal Pictures]], always budget-conscious, refused to hire a choreographer, so the Ritzes taught the sisters some eccentric steps. Thus, in ''Argentine Nights'' and the sisters' next film, ''[[Buck Privates]]'', the Andrews Sisters dance like the Ritz Brothers.{{citation needed|date = February 2013}}

''[[Buck Privates]]'', with [[Abbott and Costello]], featured the Andrews Sisters' best-known song, "[[Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy]]."<ref>"Songs That Won The War Vol. 4 The Home Front" CD program notes by Edward Habib</ref> This [[Don Raye]]-[[Hughie Prince]] composition was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Song]] at the 1941 [[Academy Awards]] ceremony.<ref name=Oscar>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1942/G|title=The 14th Academy Awards &#124; 1942|website=Oscars.org}}</ref>

[[Universal Pictures|Universal]] hired the sisters for two more Abbott and Costello comedies and then promoted them to full-fledged stardom in B musicals. ''[[What's Cookin'?]]'', ''[[Private Buckaroo]]'', ''[[Give Out, Sisters]]'' (in which they disguise themselves as old women as part of the zany plot) and [[Moonlight and Cactus (1944 film)|''Moonlight and Cactus'']] were among the team's popular full-length films.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O6kfBgAAQBAJ&q=universal+the+andrews+sisters++what's+cookin'+private+buckaroo+and+give+out+sisters&pg=PA231|title=City of Dreams: The Making and Remaking of Universal Pictures|first=Bernard F.|last=Dick|date=January 13, 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780813158891}}</ref>

The Andrews Sisters sing the title song as the opening credits roll and also perform two specialty numbers in the all-star revue ''[[Hollywood Canteen (1944 film)|Hollywood Canteen]]'' (1944). They can be seen singing "You Don't Have to Know the Language" with [[Bing Crosby]] in Paramount's ''[[Road to Rio]]'' with [[Bob Hope]], that year's highest-grossing movie.

== Setting records ==
[[Image:Bing Crosby and the Andrews Sisters.jpg|thumb|right|The Andrews Sisters performing with [[Bing Crosby]] on October 30, 1943]]
They recorded 47 songs with crooner [[Bing Crosby]], 23 of which charted on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', thus making the team one of the most successful pairings of acts in a recording studio in [[show business]] history. Their million-sellers with Crosby included "[[Pistol Packin' Mama]]",{{sfn|Gilliland|1994|loc=tape 1, side A}} "[[Don't Fence Me In (song)|Don't Fence Me In]]",<ref name=pc1b/> "South America, Take It Away", and "[[Jingle Bells]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pgwu9Pyy9c|title=Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters: "Jingle Bells"|last=MsCatreona|date=December 30, 2013|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=YouTube|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201155600/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pgwu9Pyy9c|archive-date=February 1, 2017}}</ref>

The sisters' popularity was such that after the war they discovered that some of their records had actually been smuggled into [[Germany]] after the labels had been changed to read "[[Hitler]]'s Marching Songs". Their recording of ''[[Bei Mir Bist Du Shein|Bei Mir Bist Du Schön]]'' became a favorite of the [[Nazis]], until it was discovered that the song's composers were of [[Jewish]] descent. Still, it did not stop [[concentration camp]] inmates from secretly singing it, this being most likely since the song was originally a Yiddish song "[[Bei Mir Bistu Shein]]", and had been popularized within the Jewish community before it was recorded as a more successful "cover" version by the Andrews sisters.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9mE2-RxDyZsC&q=bei+mir+bist+du+schon+was+a+popular+song+before+it+was+recorded+by+the+andrews+sisters&pg=PA76|title=The Andrews Sisters: A Biography and Career Record|first=H.

Edward Habib in the CD program notes for ''Songs That Won the War Vol. 2 The Hollywood Canteen'' states that the Andrews Sisters' radio transcription of [[Elmer's Tune]] was "so popular it even played on German radio," noting that "the opposition embraced the Andrews Sisters and their songs in the same way the Allied Forces adopted [[Lili Marlene]]."

Along with [[Bing Crosby]], separately and jointly, The Andrews Sisters were among the performers who incorporated [[ethnic]] music styles into America's [[Hit Parade]], popularizing or enhancing the popularity of songs with melodies originating in [[Brazil]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[France]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[Russia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]] and [[Trinidad]], many of which their manager chose for them.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/passionforpolkao00gree|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/passionforpolkao00gree/page/134 134]|quote=the andrews sisters ethnic styles.|title=A Passion for Polka: Old-Time Ethnic Music in America|first=Victor|last=Greene|date=November 23, 1992|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520075849|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=Internet Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HqkeBgAAQBAJ&q=the+andrews+sisters+ethnic+styles&pg=PA32|title=Swing It!: The Andrews Sisters Story|first=John|last=Sforza|date=January 13, 2015|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|access-date=May 2, 2018|via=Google Books|isbn=9780813148977}}</ref>
