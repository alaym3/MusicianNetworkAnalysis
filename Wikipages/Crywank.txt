The band is a duo consisting of vocalist/guitarist and founder Jay Clayton, and drummer Dan Watson, who joined in 2012. [[Allmusic]] describes their body of work as containing "sadness, paranoia, misery, and dry humor", comparing them to [[AJJ (band)|AJJ]] or 'a sarcastic [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]]'.<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/crywank-mn0003474187/biography|website=[[Allmusic]]|title=Allmusic Biography|last=Yeung|first=Neil Z.}}</ref> The group have independently released eight full length albums.

==History==

After early demos were distributed online, Crywank's debut album ''James Is Going to Die Soon'' was released in September 2010. Second album ''Narcissist on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown'' followed in April 2012.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/>

Clayton enlisted drummer Dan Watson to turn Crywank into a band for their third full length, ''Tomorrow Is Nearly Yesterday and Everyday Is Stupid'' which was released initially in 2013 and issued on vinyl by [[Chicago]] label [[Mutant League Records]] in 2015.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/><ref name="Idioteq">{{cite web |last1=Kamínski |first1=Karol |title=Emo band CRYWANK signs with Mutant League label |url=https://idioteq.com/emo-band-crywank-signs-mutant-league-label/ |website=Idioteq |accessdate=21 April 2019}}</ref>

Crywank released the tongue-in-cheek ''Shameless Valentines Money Grab EP'' in time for the holiday in 2014. A few weeks later, Clayton also released a [[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]-inspired EP, ''Following the Lizard Queen'', from the perspective of [[Langdon Alger]], a minor character from the show.<ref name="Allmusic Bio"/><ref name="AV Club">{{cite web|url=https://news.avclub.com/an-incredibly-obscure-simpsons-character-just-got-a-moo-1798285576|website=[[The A.V.

In April 2019 Crywank was one of the headliners at that year’s Manchester Punk Festival.<ref name="Manchester Punk Fest">{{cite web |title=Announcement #2: Smoke or Fire, Subhumans, the Creepshow and More! |url=https://manchesterpunkfestival.co.uk/mpf2019-second-band-announcement/ |website=Manchester Punk Festival |accessdate=21 April 2019}}</ref>

Crywank announced in 2019 that they were intending to break up after a world tour in the summer of 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oztix.com.au/news/archive/2019/10/10/crywank-announce-break-up-ahead-of-aussie-tour-this-month-themusic/|title=Crywank Announce Break-up Ahead Of Aussie Tour This Month|last=|first=|date=|website=Oztix|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the tour was cut short before they could tour round the USA (which they would co-headline with the band Chastity) . 

On May 1st 2020, Crywank released their seventh album entitled ''Fist Me 'Til Your Hand Comes Out My Mouth.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fist Me 'til Your Hand comes Out My Mouth, by Crywank|url=https://crywank.bandcamp.com/album/fist-me-til-your-hand-comes-out-my-mouth|access-date=2020-08-22|website=Crywank}}</ref> It is the only one of their albums to include drummer Dan Watson on lead vocals for various tracks on the album, and the band describes it as "probably [their] weirdest [album]". The album contains themes of "the importance of self-reflection and also of silliness", "how the band has affected [their] friendship / how [their] friendship has affected the band", and reflection upon the impact of their work.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Crywank on Instagram: "Our new album 'Fist Me 'til Your Hand Comes Out My Mouth' is now available on bandcamp and iTunes It'll be on streaming platforms soon…"|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B_n2mIfny5d/|access-date=2020-08-22|website=Instagram|language=en}}</ref>

On August 28th 2021, despite previously announcing that ''Fist Me 'Til Your Hand Comes Out My Mouth'' would be their final album, Crywank announced their eighth studio album ''Just Popping In to Say Hi'' would be released on September 13th of that same year, after Clayton was involved in a housefire earlier that month.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=1431412729995214857|user=CrywankBand|title=12 tracks doneCrywank - Just Popping In To Say HiOut next week<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.
