The '''Five Stairsteps''', known as "The First Family of Soul" and later "The Invisible Man's Band",<ref name=rpruter>{{cite book|last=Pruter|first=Robert|year=1992|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=0-252-06259-0|page=143|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2kkcmS0AzMEC&q=%22five+stairsteps%22+%22first+family+of+soul%22&pg=PA143|title=Chicago Soul}}</ref> was an [[Americans|American]] [[Chicago soul]] [[musical ensemble|group]] made up of five of Betty and Clarence Burke Sr.'s six children: Alohe Jean, Clarence Jr., James, Dennis, and [[Keni Burke|Kenneth "Keni"]], and briefly, Cubie. They are best known for the 1970 song "[[O-o-h Child]]", listed at number 402 on [[List of Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|''Rolling Stone'''s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].

==History==
The Chicago group was dubbed "First Family of Soul" because of their successful five-year chart run; the moniker was later passed on to [[the Jackson 5]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/406999/five-stairsteps/biography|title=The Five Stairsteps|website=Billboard.com|access-date=April 28, 2017}}</ref> Initially a teenage five-member brothers and sister [[vocal group]] made up of the children of Betty and Clarence Burke, the Five Stairsteps, named by Mrs. Burke who thought her children looked like stair steps when lined up according to their age, featured lead singer Clarence Jr. (May 25, 1949 – May 26, 2013),<ref name=obiClarenceJr>{{cite web|url=https://obits.nola.com/obituaries/nola/obituary.aspx?n=clarence-burke-jr&pid=165073516|title=Clarence Burke Jr.|date=May 31, 2013|publisher=The Times-Picayune|access-date=September 23, 2020}}</ref> Alohe, James, Dennis, and 13-year-old Kenneth ("Keni").<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=85/7}}</ref> Most of the members attended [[Harlan Community Academy High School|Harlan High School]]. Clarence Sr. was a detective for the [[Chicago Police Department]]. He backed the group on [[bass guitar]], managed them, and co-wrote songs with Clarence Jr. and Gregory Fowler.

After winning first prize in a talent contest at the [[Regal Theater, South Side (Chicago)|Regal Theater]], the Five Stairsteps received [[recording contract]] offers. A close neighbor and family friend was [[Fred Cash]] of [[the Impressions]], who introduced the group to [[Curtis Mayfield]].<ref name=rpruter/> They signed to Mayfield's Windy City imprint, which was distributed by the [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Cameo Parkway Records|Cameo Parkway]] record label, their first [[single (music)|single]] was Fowler's ballad "You Waited Too Long" backed by "Don't Waste Your Time", a Mayfield penned song.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "You Waited Too Long" peaked at number 16 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] chart in early 1966.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Around the end of 1967, Cameo Parkway folded and Windy City switched to [[Buddah Records]] through former Cameo Parkway executive [[Neil Bogart]], who joined the new label as co-president. The group's second album, ''Family Portrait'' (complete with a montage of Burke family photos), was recorded and produced in Chicago by Clarence Jr. With the addition of their three-year-old brother, the group became the Five Stairsteps & Cubie.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> ''Family Portrait'' yielded two hit singles, "Something's Missing" and a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Jimmy Charles]] and the Revellettes' hit "[[A Million to One]]". The group often toured with the Impressions. After signing with Buddah, the group was once again known as the Five Stairsteps.

Clarence Burke appeared as himself on the September 26, 1967 episode of the game show ''[[To Tell the Truth]]'', receiving two of the four possible votes by the panel members. Following the round of questioning, the group performed for the audience, singing "Danger! She's a Stranger".<ref>{{cite web |title=To Tell the Truth |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DViutBJv-LI |website=[[CBS]] |access-date=27 April 2020}}</ref>

In early 1970, the group released their biggest hit, "[[O-o-h Child]]" (written by Stan Vincent),<ref name="LarkinSM"/> which hit number 14 on the R&B chart and number 8 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The Hot 100 Chart |url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/1970-07-18 |website=Billboard.com |access-date=20 July 2020}}</ref> The record sold over one million copies, and received a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] in August 1970.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The B-side of the single, a cover of [[Lennon–McCartney]]'s "[[Dear Prudence]]", charted at number 49 R&B. Both songs were included on the group's 1970 album ''Stairsteps''.  Later that year, the group's first compilation, ''Step by Step by Step'', was released.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/The-Stairsteps-Step-By-Step-By-Step/master/729811 The Stairsteps- ''Step by Step by Step''] Discogs.com, Retrieved January 1, 2021.</ref> The Five Stairsteps appeared in the 1970 film ''The Isley Brothers Live at Yankee Stadium'', a documentary of a benefit concert filmed at the home of the [[New York Yankees]] featuring [[the Isley Brothers]], [[Johnny Maestro & the Brooklyn Bridge|the Brooklyn Bridge]] and other Buddah-affiliated artists. The following year, the group resurfaced as '''The Stairsteps''' with two charting singles: "Didn't It Look So Easy" and "I Love You-Stop".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Both were featured on their 1971 album, which was also titled ''Stairsteps''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The group continued to be known as the Stairsteps throughout the early 1970s. Alohe left the group in 1972 to begin a [[spiritual journey]], and went on to attend college, graduate and work at [[Emory University]], where she was also a guest speaker.  

Later in the 1970s, [[Billy Preston]] introduced the Stairsteps to [[the Beatles]], and the group signed with [[George Harrison]]'s [[Dark Horse Records|Dark Horse]] label, distributed by [[A&M Records]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Their album ''Second Resurrection'' was released in February 1976, produced by Preston, [[Robert Margouleff]], and the Stairsteps. "From Us to You", written by Clarence Jr. and [[Keni Burke]], was the group's biggest hit since "O-o-h Child", peaking at number 10 R&B in early 1976.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The follow-up single, "Pasado", also covered by the group [[Pockets (group)|Pockets]], received airplay in Chicago, New York, and other markets. Keni sang, played bass, and wrote both songs featured on the third single, "Tell Me Why" and "Salaam". in January 2014, the album was reissued on CD in Europe by the Solaris label, as was Keni Burke's eponymous Dark Horse album.

Cubie never really sang with the group, but would grow up to be a popular dancer with the Dance Theater of Harlem and other groups.

==Disbanded==
After the Stairsteps disbanded, Keni remained with Dark Horse as a solo artist.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> His self-produced debut solo LP, ''Keni Burke'', was released in August 1977. The singles were "Keep on Singing" and "From Me to You", an instrumental answer to "From Us to You". Becoming an in-demand session bass player, he contributed to recordings by [[Sly & the Family Stone]], [[Natalie Cole]], [[Billy Preston]], [[Les McCann]], [[the Emotions]], [[Raffi (musician)|Raffi]] and [[The Four Tops]] to [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Terry Callier]], [[Stargard (band)|Stargard]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Linda Clifford]], [[Silk (group)|Silk]], [[Narada Michael Walden]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Diana Ross]] and [[Gladys Knight]]. He appeared as part of [[Bill Withers]]' band around this time and co-produced his album ''Menagerie'', which included the hit single "[[Lovely Day (song)|Lovely Day]]".

===The Invisible Man's Band===
In 1978, Clarence, Jr. teamed up with New York-based producer [[Alex Masucci]] to form the group '''The Invisible Man's Band'''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  Not interested in recording without his brothers, Clarence convinced Keni, James, and Dennis, along with keyboardist Dean Gant and drummer [[Steve Ferrone]], to come to New York City's Brill building to record an album under the Invisible Man's Band moniker. The group's self-titled debut, produced by Masucci and Clarence, Jr. and released in 1980 by [[Mango Records|Mango]]/[[Island Records]], featured the heavily [[disco]]-styled hit "All Night Thing", which returned the Burke brothers to the top ten on the [[R&B chart]]. The tune also reached number 45 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

The following year, Clarence, Jr. and Masucci formed Seduction Productions. As the new vehicle for the Invisible Man's Band, they signed a production deal with [[Boardwalk Records]], [[Neil Bogart]]'s successor label to [[Casablanca Records]]. The group released a follow-up album, ''Really Wanna See You''. The title track and "Rated X" were issued as singles, but neither track received much promotion, as shortly thereafter, Bogart died and the label was disbanded. The Invisible Man's Band released a final single, "Sunday Afternoon", on the Move 'N Groove record label, formed by Masucci and Clarence, Jr. in 1983.

===Keni Burke resumes solo work===
Later in 1981, Burke got a new solo album deal with RCA Records. The self-produced LP ''You're the Best'' included the singles "Let Somebody Love You" and "You're the Best". His next RCA album, 1982's ''[[Changes (Keni Burke album)|Changes]]'', yielded his biggest solo hit, "[[Risin' to the Top]]". While the song only peaked at number 63 R&B in late summer 1982, it inspired [[Mary Jane Girls|the Mary Jane Girls]]' breakout hit the following year, "[[All Night Long (Mary Jane Girls song)|All Night Long]]". "Risin' to the Top" has since been [[sampling (music)|sampled]] (often along with "All Night Long") by artists such as [[LL Cool J]] ("[[Around the Way Girl]]"), [[Doug E. Fresh]] ("Keep Risin' to the Top"), [[Mary J. Blige]] ("[[Love No Limit]]" and "Mary Jane (All Night Long)") and Ali ("Feelin' You").{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The second ''Changes'' single was "Shakin'". The album also included one of the last songs by Philadelphia songwriter [[Linda Creed]] (co-written with [[Thom Bell]]), the mid-tempo ballad "One Minute More". Burke worked as a writer/producer (frequently with keyboardist Dean Gant and former [[Average White Band]] drummer [[Steve Ferrone]]) with [[the O'Jays]], [[the Jones Girls]], [[the Whispers]], [[Keith Sweat]], [[George Howard (jazz)|George Howard]], [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Bill Withers]], and [[Perri (group)|Perri]], among others. After meeting Expansion Records executive Ralph Tee, Burke signed with the [[Sony]] distributed UK label. ''Nothin' But Love'' was his first album for the label and was released in March 1998. The first 12-inch single was "I Need Your Love", with vocals by Burke's son, Osaze "Ozzie" Burke.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}
