'''Ben Folds Five''' is an American [[alternative rock]] trio formed in 1993 in [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]]. The group's members are [[Ben Folds]] ([[Lead vocalist|lead vocals]], [[piano]], keyboards, melodica, principal songwriting), [[Robert Sledge]] ([[bass guitar]], double bass, synthesizer, backing vocals), and [[Darren Jessee]] ([[Drum kit|drums]], percussion, backing vocals, songwriter). The group achieved mainstream success in the [[alternative music|alternative]], [[indie music|indie]] and [[pop music]] scenes. Their single "[[Brick (song)|Brick]]" from the 1997 album ''[[Whatever and Ever Amen]]'' gained airplay on many mainstream radio stations. During their first seven years together, the band released three proper studio records, one [[retrospective album]] of [[B-side]]s and outtakes, and eight singles. They also contributed to a number of soundtracks and compilations. Ben Folds Five disbanded in October 2000. They reunited in 2011, and released their fourth album ''[[The Sound of the Life of the Mind]]'' in 2012.

==History==
===1993–2000===
Ben Folds Five was formed in 1993 in Chapel Hill by Ben Folds.  They were a trio in spite of their name, and the primary motivation behind the name, apart from the band's well-known use of humor, was simple preference, according to Ben: "I think it sounds better than Ben Folds Three."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dropd.com/issue/46/BenFoldsFive/ |title=Waist Deep in Pianos and Buses |access-date=September 2, 2006 |last=Hofmann |first=Pieter |date=March 10, 1997 |publisher=Drop-D Magazine }}</ref> 
Folds once described their music as "punk rock for sissies," a reaction to the angst prevalent in '90s rock.<ref>{{cite news|last = Thomas |first = Sarah |title = Ben Folds with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra |newspaper = Sydney Morning Herald |date = 2006-08-25 |url = http://www.smh.com.au/news/gig-reviews/ben-folds-with-the-sydney-symphony/2006/08/25/1156012707758.html |access-date = 2006-09-23 }}</ref>

Their first radio single was "Underground" from their [[Ben Folds Five (album)|self-titled debut album]], released in 1995 on Caroline Records. The band's biggest success was the single "[[Brick (song)|Brick]]" from their second album, ''[[Whatever and Ever Amen]],'' released in 1997. It was followed by the more somber and jazz-based 1999 album, ''[[The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner]]''. The group contributed an outtake from the ''Reinhold Messner'' sessions, titled "Leather Jacket", to the 1999 benefit album, ''[[No Boundaries: A Benefit for the Kosovar Refugees]]''.

The band's final released recording was a cover of [[Steely Dan]]'s "Barrytown" for the ''[[Me, Myself & Irene]]'' soundtrack. The band had begun work on a fourth studio album, but following the worldwide tour in support of ''The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner'', the band "amicably" broke up in October 2000.  Tracks from the sessions would later emerge on subsequent solo projects.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Music/Ben-with-the-breeze/2005/03/31/1111862476057.html|title=Ben with the Breeze|access-date=November 27, 2006|publisher=The Breeze | location=Melbourne | date=April 1, 2005}}</ref>

===After the break-up===
Folds went on to pursue a successful solo career, releasing ''[[Rockin' the Suburbs]]'' in 2001, ''[[Songs for Silverman]]'' in 2005, ''[[Way to Normal]]'' in 2008, ''[[Lonely Avenue (album)|Lonely Avenue]]'' in collaboration with novelist [[Nick Hornby]] in 2010, and ''[[So There (Ben Folds album)|So There]]'' in collaboration with the chamber group yMusic in 2015. He produced and arranged actor [[William Shatner]]'s second album, ''[[Has Been]]'', as well as co-wrote the majority of the songs with Shatner. Folds also contributed songs to the soundtracks for the animated movies ''[[Hoodwinked!]]'' and ''[[Over the Hedge (film)|Over the Hedge]]''.

[[Darren Jessee]] formed the acclaimed indie band [[Hotel Lights]], with his songs featured in television and film. Jessee released five studio albums for [[Bar/None Records]] including ''[[Hotel Lights (album)|Hotel Lights]]'' in 2006, ''[[Firecracker People]]'' in 2008, ''Girl Graffiti'' in 2011, ''Get Your Hand in My Hand'' in 2016, and his first solo album, ''The Jane, Room 217'' in 2018.

Robert Sledge played with International Orange until the group disbanded in 2005. He is currently the bass player in the three-piece Chapel Hill, NC band Surrender Human with Matt McMichaels from the [[Mayflies USA]].

===2008 reunion===
Ben Folds Five made a one-off concert appearance in September 2008 at the UNC Memorial Hall in Chapel Hill as part of the [[MySpace]] "Front to Back" series, in which artists play an entire album live. The band played its then-final album, ''[[The Unauthorized Biography of Reinhold Messner]]'', and were briefly joined on stage by Ben's father, Dean Folds, who read a transcript of his voice mail message that is used in the album song "Your Most Valuable Possession", encoring with some of the songs from their first two albums''.<ref>[http://www.newsobserver.com/lifestyles/story/1224414.html "Ben Folds Five delights in reunion"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922031139/http://www.newsobserver.com/lifestyles/story/1224414.html |date=September 22, 2008 }}</ref>

===2011–2013: ''The Sound of the Life of the Mind'', ''Live'' and hiatus===
In 2011, Ben Folds Five reunited to record three tracks for Ben Folds' ''[[The Best Imitation of Myself: A Retrospective]]''. Sarah Rodman of the ''Boston Globe'' also reported that Ben Folds Five would be reconvened in December 2011 to record a new album.

For the 2012 [[Mountain Jam (festival)|Mountain Jam]] festival, Ben Folds Five was announced as one of the main headliners. It was at Mountain Jam where Ben Folds Five reunited for their first live performance together in years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benfolds.com/news/catch-ben-folds-fives-first-reunion-performance-tomorrow |title=Catch Ben Folds Five's First Reunion Performance Tomorrow! &#124; The Official Ben Folds Site |publisher=Benfolds.com |date=June 1, 2012 |access-date=September 18, 2012}}</ref> They were also announced in the 2012 [[Bonnaroo]] and [[Summerfest]] lineups. The band announced an August release of their new album, followed by a full American tour in September and October. They then travelled to Ireland and the UK for a tour in November and December 2012. These dates eventually formed The Sound of the Life of the Mind Tour.

On May 7, 2012, Ben Folds Five launched an interactive pre-sale campaign for the release of their new album on [[PledgeMusic]]. The campaign shot to 200% in its first week of being live.  Folds has said that they have enough material for at least two more records.<ref name="thesynthesizersympathizer">{{cite web|url=http://thesynthesizersympathizer.blogspot.com/2012/05/ben-folds-audio-interview-new-ben-folds.html |title=Ben Folds Audio Interview – New Ben Folds Five Record |access-date=June 1, 2012 |last=Folds |first=Ben |date=May 15, 2012 |publisher=Blogger }}</ref>
