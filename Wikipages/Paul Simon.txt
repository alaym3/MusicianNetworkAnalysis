'''Paul Frederic Simon''' (born October 13, 1941) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, and actor whose career has spanned six decades. He is one of the most acclaimed songwriters in popular music.

Simon was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], and grew up in the [[Queens|borough of Queens]] in New York City. He began performing with his schoolfriend [[Art Garfunkel]] in 1956 when they were still in their early teens. After limited success, the pair reunited after an electrified version of their song "[[The Sound of Silence]]" became a hit in 1966. [[Simon & Garfunkel]] recorded five albums together featuring songs mostly written by Simon, including the hits "[[Mrs. Robinson]]", "[[America (Simon & Garfunkel song)|America]]", "[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge over Troubled Water]]", and "[[The Boxer]]".<ref>Bronson p. 428</ref>

After Simon & Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon recorded three acclaimed albums over the following five years,<ref name = "PBS">{{cite web | title = Episodes: Paul Simon | work = American Masters | date = February 26, 2001 | publisher = [[PBS]] | url = https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/paul-simon/about-paul-simon/705/ | access-date = December 6, 2009}}</ref> all of which charted in the top 5 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. His [[Paul Simon (album)|1972 self-titled album]] contained the hit songs "[[Mother and Child Reunion]]" and "[[Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard]]". The 1975 album ''[[Still Crazy After All These Years]]'', which featured guest vocals from Garfunkel, was his first number-one solo album, and featured the number 1 hit single "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]", among other top-40 songs such as "[[Still Crazy After All These Years (song)|Still Crazy After All These Years]]", "[[Gone at Last]]", and "[[My Little Town]]".

Simon reunited with Garfunkel for a performance in [[New York Central Park]] in 1981, drawing half a million spectators, followed by a world tour with Garfunkel. After a career slump, Simon released [[Graceland (album)|''Graceland'']], an album inspired by [[Jaiva|South African township music]], which sold 14 million copies worldwide and remains his most popular and acclaimed solo work.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/16/paul-simon-graceland-london | title= Paul Simon brings Graceland back to London, 25 years after apartheid boycott row | work=The Guardian | location=London | first=Robin | last=Denselow | date=March 16, 2012 | access-date=November 12, 2016}}</ref>  A number of hit singles were released from the album, including "[[You Can Call Me Al]]", "[[The Boy in the Bubble]]", and "[[Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes]]". It won the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] in 1987.

Simon continued to tour throughout the 1990s, wrote a [[Broadway musical]], ''[[The Capeman]]'', and recorded a companion album, ''[[Songs from The Capeman]]'' which was released in 1997. His 2000 album ''[[You're the One (album)|You're the One]]'' was nominated again for Album of the Year honors. He followed that album up with several years of touring, including another reunion tour with Garfunkel, and released ''[[Surprise (Paul Simon album)|Surprise]]'', his last album of the decade, in 2006. In 2016 he released ''[[Stranger to Stranger (Paul Simon album)|Stranger to Stranger]]'', which debuted at number 3 on the [[Billboard 200|Billboard Album Chart]] and number 1 the [[UK Albums Chart]], and marked his greatest commercial and critical success in thirty years. His most recent album is 2018's ''[[In the Blue Light]]'', which contains re-arrangements of lesser-known songs from his prior albums.

Simon has earned sixteen [[Grammy Award]]s for his solo and collaborative work, including three for Album of the Year (''Bridge Over Troubled Water'', ''Still Crazy After All These Years'', and ''Graceland''), and a Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref name = "Grammy">{{cite web | title = Grammy Award Winners | publisher = National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences | url = http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx | access-date = December 6, 2009| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091209065656/http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx | archive-date=December 9, 2009 }}</ref> He is a two-time inductee into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]: first in 1990 as a member of Simon & Garfunkel and again in 2001 for his solo career.<ref name="rockhall1">{{cite web | title = Biography and Timeline: Paul Simon | department = Inductees | publisher = [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]| url = http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/paul-simon}}</ref> In 2006 he was selected as one of the "100 People Who Shaped the World" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|title=Paul Simon|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975847_1976759,00.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100903180733/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975847_1976759,00.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 3, 2010|work=Time |access-date=April 4, 2011|date=May 8, 2006}}</ref> In 2011, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named Simon one of the 100 greatest guitarists,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-guitarists-20111123/paul-simon-20111122 | work= [[Rolling Stone]] | title= 93: Paul Simon | date= November 23, 2011}}</ref> and in 2015 he was ranked eighth in their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-songwriters#paul-simon | work= [[Rolling Stone]] | title= 8: Paul Simon | date= August 2015}}</ref> Simon was the first recipient of the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[Gershwin Prize|Gershwin Prize for Popular Song]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | title = Paul Simon: The Library of Congress Gershwin Prize for Popular Song | publisher=[[PBS]] | url = https://www.pbs.org/previews/paulsimon/ | access-date = December 6, 2009}}</ref>

==Early life==
Simon was born on October 13, 1941, in [[Newark, New Jersey]], to [[Hungarian-Jewish]] parents.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://jewishjournal.com/culture/218363/heres-paul-simon-skirball-showcases-words-music-2/|title=Here's to you, Paul Simon: Skirball showcases his 'Words & Music'|last=Torok|first=Ryan|date=April 26, 2017|work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles|Jewish Journal]]|access-date=June 22, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|title= Monitor|journal= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date= Oct 14–21, 2011|issue= 1176/1177|page= 34}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date= March 19, 2008|url= http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=207|title= jewornotjew – Paul Simon|access-date= August 30, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date= October 29, 2012|url= http://www.paul-simon.info/PHP/biography.php|title= The open Paul Simon biography|publisher= paul-simon.info}}</ref> His father, Louis (1916–1995), was a college professor, [[double-bass]] player, and dance bandleader who performed under the name Lee Sims. His mother, Belle (1910–2007), was an elementary-school teacher. In 1945, his family moved to the [[Kew Gardens Hills, Queens|Kew Gardens Hills]] section of [[Flushing, Queens]], in New York City.{{sfn|Kingston|1996|p=1}}

The musician [[Donald Fagen]] described Simon's childhood as that of "a certain kind of [[Jews in New York City|New York Jew]], almost a stereotype, really, to whom music and baseball are very important. I think it has to do with the parents. The parents are either immigrants or first-generation Americans who felt like outsiders, and assimilation was the key thought—they gravitated to black music and baseball looking for an alternative culture."<ref name="Dawidoff 2011">Dawidoff, Nicholas. "[https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/paul-simons-restless-journey-20110512 Paul Simons' Restless Journey]," ''Rolling Stone'', May 12, 2011, pp. 54–63</ref> Simon, upon hearing Fagen's description, said it "isn't far from the truth."<ref name="Dawidoff 2011" /> Simon said about his childhood, "I was a ballplayer. I'd go on my bike, and I'd hustle kids in [[stickball]]." He added that his father was a [[New York Yankees]] fan:

{{blockquote|I used to listen to games with my father. He was a nice guy. Fun. Funny. Smart. He didn't play with me as much as I played with my kids. He was at work until late at night. ... Sometimes [until] two in the morning.<ref name="Dawidoff 2011"/>}}

Simon's musical career began after meeting [[Art Garfunkel]] when they were both 11. They performed in a production of'' [[Alice in Wonderland]]'' for their sixth-grade graduation, and began singing together when they were 13,<ref>[[Old Friends: Live on Stage]] live concert DVD and CD, the spoken introduction to "Hey Schoolgirl".</ref> occasionally performing at school dances. Their idols were [[the Everly Brothers]], whom they imitated in their use of close two-part harmony. Simon also developed an interest in jazz, folk, and blues, especially in the music of [[Woody Guthrie]] and [[Lead Belly]].

At 12 or 13 Simon wrote his first song called, "The Girl for Me", written for him and Art Garfunkel. According to Simon, it became the "neighborhood hit." His father wrote the words and chords on paper for the boys to use. That paper became the first officially copyrighted Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel song, and is now in the [[Library of Congress]]. In 1957, in their mid-teens, they recorded the song "Hey, Schoolgirl" under the name "Tom & Jerry", a name that was given to them by their label Big Records. The single reached No. 49 on the pop charts.

After graduating from [[Forest Hills High School (New York)|Forest Hills High School]], Simon majored in English at [[Queens College]] and graduated in 1963, while Garfunkel studied mathematics education at [[Columbia University]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/ph-new-hit-paul-simon-article-1.756872|title=PhD is new hit for Paul Simon |website=Daily News|location=New York| access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Dawidoff 2011" /> Simon was a brother in the [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]] fraternity,<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Alumni|url=http://www.aepi.org/about-aepi/notable-alumni/|publisher=Alpha Epsilon Pi|access-date=January 23, 2014}}</ref> earned a degree in English literature, and briefly attended [[Brooklyn Law School]] for one semester after graduation in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seniorcitylocal.com/celebrating-seniors-paul-simon-turns-75/|title=Celebrating Seniors – Paul Simon Turns 75 – 50 Plus World|website=seniorcitylocal.com|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZ_YBAAAQBAJ&q=paul+simon+brooklyn+law+school&pg=PR14|title=Paul Simon: An American Tune|first=Cornel|last=Bonca|date=October 10, 2014|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=9780810884823|access-date=March 19, 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>

==Career==

===Early career===
[[File:Paul Simon in 1966.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Simon in 1966.]]
Between 1957 and 1964, Simon wrote, recorded and released more than 30 songs, occasionally reuniting with Garfunkel as Tom & Jerry for some singles, including "Our Song" and "That's My Story". Most of the songs Simon recorded during that time were performed alone or with musicians other than Garfunkel. They were released on minor record labels including Amy, Big, Hunt, [[King Records (United States)|King]], Tribute, and Madison. He used several pseudonyms for these recordings, usually "Jerry Landis", but also "Paul Kane" and "True Taylor". By 1962, working as Jerry Landis, he was a frequent writer/producer for several Amy Records artists, overseeing material released by Dotty Daniels, The Vels and [[Ritchie Cordell]].

Simon enjoyed moderate success with singles as part of the group ''Tico and the Triumphs'', including "Motorcycle", which reached No. 97 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts in 1962. Tico and the Triumphs released four 45s. Marty Cooper, known as Tico, sang lead on several of these releases, but "Motorcycle" featured Simon's vocal. Also in 1962, Simon reached No. 99 on the pop charts as Jerry Landis with the [[novelty song]] "The Lone Teen Ranger". Both chart singles were released on [[Amy Records]].

===Simon and Garfunkel===

{{Main|Simon & Garfunkel}}
In early 1964, Simon and Garfunkel got an audition with [[Columbia Records]], whose executive [[Clive Davis]] signed them to produce an album. Columbia decided that the two would be called "Simon & Garfunkel" instead of "Tom & Jerry". According to Simon, this was the first time artists' surnames had been used in pop music without their first names.<ref>Paul Simon, Speech given upon induction to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], [[Cleveland]], 2003.</ref> Simon and Garfunkel's first LP, ''[[Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.]]'', was released on October 19, 1964, with 12 songs, five of which were written by Simon. The album initially flopped.

After the album release, Simon moved to England.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/paulsimonlife0000elio|url-access=registration|page=[https://archive.org/details/paulsimonlife0000elio/page/n62 53]|date=2010|author=Marc Eliot|title=Paul Simon: A Life|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn= 978-0-470-43363-8}}</ref> While in the UK, Simon produced [[Jackson C. Frank]]'s first and only album and co-wrote several songs with [[Bruce Woodley]] of the Australian pop group [[the Seekers]], including "I Wish You Could Be Here", "Cloudy", and "[[Red Rubber Ball]]". Woodley's co-author credit was omitted from "Cloudy" on the ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'' album. The American group [[the Cyrkle]] recorded a version of "Red Rubber Ball" that reached No. 2 in the U.S. Simon also contributed to the Seekers' catalogue with "Someday One Day", which was released in March 1966, charting around the same time as Simon and Garfunkel's "[[Homeward Bound (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Homeward Bound]]" (a Top 10 hit from their ''second'' UK album, ''[[Sounds of Silence (album)|Sounds of Silence]]'' and later included on their third U.S. album, ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]'').

Back on the American East Coast, radio stations began receiving requests for the ''Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M.'' track "[[The Sound of Silence]]". Simon & Garfunkel's producer, [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], overdubbed the track with electric guitar, bass guitar and drums, releasing it as a single that eventually went to No. 1 on the U.S. pop charts.<ref name='How "The Sound of Silence" Became a Surprise Hit'>{{cite web|last1=Himes|first1=Geoffrey|title=How 'The Sound of Silence' Became a Surprise Hit|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/sound-silence-surprise-hit-180957672/|website=Smithsonian Magazine|access-date=February 23, 2018}}</ref> Wilson did not inform the duo of his plan, and Simon was "horrified" when he first heard it.<ref name="Eliot65">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jQGOxvDsF-kC&pg=PA65|page=65|date=2010|author=Marc Eliot|title=Paul Simon: A Life|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn= 978-0-470-43363-8}}</ref>

The success of "The Sound of Silence" drew Simon back to the United States to reunite with Garfunkel. Together they recorded four more albums: ''[[Sounds of Silence (album)|Sounds of Silence]]''; ''[[Parsley, Sage, Rosemary and Thyme]]''; ''[[Bookends (album)|Bookends]]''; and the hugely successful ''[[Bridge over Troubled Water]]''. Simon and Garfunkel also contributed extensively to the soundtrack of the [[Mike Nichols]] film ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), starring [[Dustin Hoffman]] and [[Anne Bancroft]]. While writing "[[Mrs. Robinson]]", Simon originally toyed with the title "Mrs. Roosevelt". When Garfunkel reported this indecision over the song's name to the director, Nichols replied, "Don't be ridiculous! We're making a movie here! It's Mrs. Robinson!"<ref>David Fricke, in the leaflet accompaniment to the Simon and Garfunkel 1997 album "Old Friends"</ref>

Simon and Garfunkel returned to the UK in the fall of 1968 and did a church concert appearance at Kraft Hall, which was broadcast on the BBC, and also featured Paul's brother Ed on a performance of the instrumental "Anji".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E21lzfpt8Dg | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211027/E21lzfpt8Dg| archive-date=2021-10-27|title=Simon & Garfunkel – Kraft Music Hall 1968 Part 2 of 3 |via=YouTube |date=January 3, 1968 |access-date=July 15, 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Simon pursued solo projects after ''Bridge over Troubled Water'', reuniting occasionally with Garfunkel for various projects. Actor [[Warren Beatty]] brought Simon into a solo performance at the [[Cleveland Arena]] in April 1972<ref>{{cite news |title=Candidate's Day: McGovern Fund Gala Is Sold Out |date=April 29, 1972 |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/04/29/archives/mcgovern-fund-concert-in-cleveland-is-sold-out.html}}</ref>—a benefit concert for the [[George McGovern 1972 presidential campaign]]—and after that, Beatty obtained the duo's agreement to reunite in mid-June at [[Madison Square Garden]], another political concert called [[Together for McGovern]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1972/06/15/archives/rock-n-rhetoric-rally-in-the-garden-aids-mcgovern.html |last=Phillips |first=McCandlish |author-link=McCandlish Phillips |date=June 15, 1972 |title=Rock 'n' Rhetoric Rally in the Garden Aids McGovern |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref> Garfunkel joined Simon again on the 1975 Top Ten single "[[My Little Town]]". Simon wrote it for Garfunkel, whose solo output Simon judged to be lacking "bite". The song was included on their respective solo albums: Paul Simon's ''[[Still Crazy After All These Years]]'' and Garfunkel's ''[[Breakaway (Art Garfunkel album)|Breakaway]]''. Contrary to popular belief, the song is not autobiographical of Simon's early life in New York City.<ref>Humphries, Patrick. ''The Boy in the Bubble'', p. 96.</ref> Simon also provided guitar on Garfunkel's 1973 album ''[[Angel Clare]]'', and added backing vocals to the song "[[Down in the Willow Garden]]". In 1981, they reunited again for the famous [[The Concert in Central Park|concert in Central Park]], followed by a world tour and an aborted reunion album, to have been entitled ''Think Too Much'', which was eventually released (without Garfunkel) as ''[[Hearts and Bones]]''. Together, they were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1990.<ref name="rockhall1"/>

In 2003, Simon and Garfunkel reunited once again when they received a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]. This reunion led to a US tour—the acclaimed "Old Friends" concert series—followed by a 2004 international encore that culminated in a free concert at the [[Colosseum]] in Rome that drew 600,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/read/news/12175339 |title=Paul Simon News on Yahoo!

The pair performed together in April 2010 in New Orleans at the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]].<ref>{{cite web |first=John |last=McCusker |work=The Times-Picayune |url=http://www.nola.com/jazzfest/index.ssf/2010/04/simon_and_garfunkel.html |title=The sun shined at New Orleans Jazz Fest, even if Simon and Garfunkel's harmonies didn't |publisher=NOLA.com |access-date=July 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428220847/http://www.nola.com/jazzfest/index.ssf/2010/04/simon_and_garfunkel.html |archive-date=April 28, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===1971–1976===
After Simon and Garfunkel split in 1970, Simon began writing and recording solo material again. His album ''[[Paul Simon (album)|Paul Simon]]'' was released in January 1972, preceded by his first experiment with world music, the Jamaican-inspired "[[Mother and Child Reunion]]". The single was a hit, reaching both the American and British Top 5. The album received universal acclaim, with critics praising the variety of styles and the confessional lyrics, reaching No. 4 in the U.S. and No. 1 in the UK and Japan. It later spawned another Top 30 hit with "[[Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard]]".

Simon's next project was the pop-folk album, ''[[There Goes Rhymin' Simon]]'', released in May 1973. It contained some of his most popular and polished recordings. The lead single, "[[Kodachrome (song)|Kodachrome]]", was a No. 2 hit in America, and the follow-up, the gospel-flavored "[[Loves Me Like a Rock]]" was even bigger, topping the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' charts. Other songs like the weary "[[American Tune]]" or the melancholic "Something So Right"—a tribute to Simon's first wife, Peggy—became standards in the musician's catalog. Critical and commercial reception for this second album was even stronger than for his debut. At the time, reviewers noted how the songs were fresh and unworried on the surface, while still exploring socially and politically conscious themes on a deeper level.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} The album reached No. 1 on the ''Cashbox'' album charts. As a souvenir for the tour that came next, in 1974 it was released as a live album, ''[[Live Rhymin']]'', which was moderately successful and displayed some changes in Simon's music style, adopting world and religious music.

Highly anticipated, ''[[Still Crazy After All These Years]]'' was his next album. Released in October 1975 and produced by Simon and [[Phil Ramone]], it marked another departure. The mood of the album was darker, as he wrote and recorded it in the wake of his divorce. Preceded by the feel-good duet with [[Phoebe Snow]], "Gone at Last" (a Top 25 hit) and the Simon & Garfunkel reunion track "My Little Town" (a No. 9 on Billboard), the album was his only No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' charts to date. The [[18th Grammy Awards]] named it the [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and Simon's performance the year's [[Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance|Best Male Pop Vocal]]. With Simon in the forefront of popular music, the third single from the album, "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]" reached the top spot of the ''Billboard'' charts, his only single to reach No. 1 on this list. Also, on May 3, 1976, Simon put together a benefit show at [[Madison Square Garden]] to raise money for the [[New York Public Library]]. Phoebe Snow, [[Jimmy Cliff]] and the Brecker Brothers also performed. The concert produced over $30,000 for the Library.

===1977–1985===
After three successful studio albums, Simon became less productive during the second half of the 1970s. He dabbled in various projects, including writing music for the film ''[[Shampoo (film)|Shampoo]]'', which became the music for the song "Silent Eyes" on the ''Still Crazy'' album, and acting (he was cast as Tony Lacey in [[Woody Allen]]'s film ''[[Annie Hall]]''). He achieved another hit in this decade, with the lead single of his 1977 compilation, ''[[Greatest Hits, Etc.]]'', "[[Slip Slidin' Away]]," reaching No. 5 in the United States.

In 1980, Simon released ''[[One-Trick Pony (album)|One-Trick Pony]]'', his debut album with [[Warner Bros. Records]] and his first in almost five years. It was paired with the [[One-Trick Pony (film)|motion picture of the same name]], which Simon wrote and starred in. Although it produced his last Top 10 hit with the upbeat "Late in the Evening" (also a No. 1 hit on the [[Radio & Records]] American charts), the album did not sell well.

Simon & Garfunkel included eight songs from Simon's solo career on the set list for their [[The Concert in Central Park|September 19, 1981 concert in Central Park]]. Five of those were rearranged as duets; Simon performed the other three songs solo. The resulting live album, TV special, and videocassette (later DVD) releases were all major hits.

Simon released ''[[Hearts and Bones]]'' in 1983. This was a polished and confessional album that was eventually viewed as one of his best works, but the album did not sell well when it was released. This marked a low point in Simon's commercial popularity; both the album and the lead single, "Allergies", missed the American Top 40. ''Hearts and Bones'' included "[[The Late Great Johnny Ace]]", a song partly about [[Johnny Ace]], an American [[R&B]] singer, and partly about slain [[the Beatles|Beatle]] [[John Lennon]]. In January 1985, Simon lent his talent to [[USA for Africa]] and performed on the [[Humanitarian aid|relief]] fundraising single "[[We Are the World]]".

===1986–1992===
As he commented years later, after the disappointing commercial performance of ''Hearts and Bones,'' Simon felt he had lost his inspiration to a point of no return, and that his commercial fortunes were unlikely to change. While driving his car in late 1984 in this state of frustration, Simon listened to a cassette of the Boyoyo Boys' instrumental ''Gumboots: Accordion Jive Volume II'' which had been lent to him by Heidi Berg, a singer-songwriter he was working with at the time. Lorne Michaels had introduced Simon to Berg when Berg was working as the bandleader for Michael's ''The New Show''. Interested by the unusual sound, he wrote lyrics to the number, which he sang over a re-recording of the song. It was the first composition of a new musical project that became the Grammy Award-winning album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]'', a mixture of musical styles including pop, [[a cappella]], [[isicathamiya]], rock, [[zydeco]] and [[mbaqanga]].

Simon travelled to South Africa to embark on further recording the album. Sessions with African musicians took place in [[Johannesburg]] in February 1985. Overdubbing and additional recording was done in April 1986, in New York. The sessions featured many South African musicians and groups, particularly [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]]. Simon also collaborated with several American artists, singing a duet with [[Linda Ronstadt]] in "Under African Skies", and playing with [[Los Lobos]] in "All Around the World or The Myth of Fingerprints". Simon was briefly listed on the UN Boycott list but was removed after he indicated that he had not violated the [[Apartheid#Cultural boycott|cultural boycott]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/03/arts/paul-simon-removed-from-un-boycott-list.html|title=Paul Simon Removed From U.N.

[[Warner Bros. Records]] had serious doubts about releasing such an eclectic album to the mainstream,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} but did so in August 1986. ''Graceland'' was praised by critics and the public, and became Simon's most successful solo album. Slowly climbing the worldwide charts, it reached No. 1 in many countries, including the UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand—and peaked at No. 3 in the U.S. It was the second-best-selling album of 1987 in the US, selling five million copies and eventually reaching 5x Platinum certification. Another seven million copies sold internationally, making it his best-selling album. The lead single was "[[You Can Call Me Al]]", utilising a synthesizer riff, a [[whistle]] solo, and an unusual bass run, in which the second half was a reversed recording of the first half. "You Can Call Me Al" was accompanied by a humorous video featuring actor [[Chevy Chase]] (who [[lip sync]]ed all of Simon's lyrics while Simon sits next to him, silently playing various instruments), which was shown on [[MTV]]. The single reached UK Top 5 and the U.S. Top 25. Further singles, including the lead track, "The Boy in the Bubble" and "Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes", were not commercial hits but became radio standards and were highly praised.

At age 45, Simon found himself back at the forefront of popular music. He received the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] in 1987 and also [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year]] for the title track one year later. He also embarked on the very successful ''Graceland Tour'', which was documented on music video. Simon found himself embracing new sounds, which some critics viewed negatively—however, Simon reportedly felt it was a natural artistic experiment, considering that ''[[world music]]'' was already present on much of his early work, including such Simon & Garfunkel hits as "[[El Cóndor Pasa (song)|El Condor Pasa]]" and his early solo recording "[[Mother and Child Reunion]]", which was recorded in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. One way or another, Warner Bros. Records (who by this time controlled and reissued all his previous Columbia albums) re-established Simon as one of their most successful artists. In an attempt to capitalize on his renewed success, WB Records released the album ''[[Negotiations and Love Songs]]'' in November 1988, a mixture of popular hits and personal favorites that covered Simon's entire career and became an enduring seller in his catalog.

After ''Graceland'', Simon decided to extend his roots with the [[Culture of Brazil|Brazilian]] music-flavored ''[[The Rhythm of the Saints]]''. Sessions for the album began in December 1989, and took place in [[Rio de Janeiro]] and New York, featuring guitarist [[J. J. Cale]] and many Brazilian and African musicians. The tone of the album was more introspective and relatively low-key compared to the mostly upbeat numbers of ''Graceland''. Released in October 1990, the album received excellent critical reviews and achieved very respectable sales, peaking at No. 4 in the U.S. and No. 1 in the UK. The lead single, "The Obvious Child", featuring the Grupo Cultural Olodum, became his last Top 20 hit in the UK and appeared near the bottom of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Although not as successful as ''Graceland'', ''The Rhythm of the Saints'' was received as a competent successor and consistent complement on Simon's attempts to explore (and popularize) world music, and also received a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year.

Simon's ex-wife [[Carrie Fisher]] said in her autobiography ''[[Wishful Drinking]]'' that the song "[[She Moves On]]" is about her. It's one of several she claimed, followed by the line, "If you can get Paul Simon to write a song about you, do it. Because he is so brilliant at it."<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o5L4qkuXdZQC&q=wishful+drinking | title=Wishful Drinking |via=Google Books | isbn=9781439153710 | access-date=July 15, 2011| last1=Fisher | first1=Carrie | date=September 8, 2009 }}</ref>
 
The success of both albums allowed Simon to stage another New York concert. On August 15, 1991, almost a decade after his concert with Garfunkel, Simon staged a second concert in Central Park with African and South American bands. The success of the concert surpassed all expectations, and reportedly over 750,000 people attended—one of the largest concert audiences in history. He later remembered the concert as "...the most memorable moment in my career." The success of the show led to both a live album and an [[Emmy]]-winning TV special. In the middle, Simon embarked on the successful ''Born at the Right Time Tour'', and promoted the album with further singles, including "Proof"—accompanied with a humorous video that again featured Chevy Chase, and added Steve Martin. On March 4, 1992, he appeared on his own episode of ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'', offering renditions of many of his most famous compositions. Broadcast in June, the show was a success, though it did not receive an album release.

===1993–1998===
After ''Unplugged'', Simon's place in the forefront of popular music dropped notably. A Simon & Garfunkel reunion took place in September 1993, and in another attempt to capitalize on the occasion, Columbia released ''[[Paul Simon 1964/1993]]'' in September, a three-disc compilation that received a reduced version on the two-disc album ''[[The Paul Simon Anthology]]'' one month later. In 1995 he made news for appearing on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'', where he performed the song "Ten Years", which he composed specially for the tenth anniversary of the show. Also that year, he was featured on the [[Annie Lennox]] version of his 1973 song "Something So Right", which appeared briefly on the UK Top 50 once it was released as a single in November.

Since the early stages of the nineties, Simon was fully involved on ''[[The Capeman]]'', a musical that finally opened on January 29, 1998. Simon worked enthusiastically on the project for many years and described it as "a New York Puerto Rican story based on events that happened in 1959—events that I remembered."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whizzo.ca/simon/simon94_99.html |title=whizzo.ca |publisher=whizzo.ca |access-date=October 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924032430/http://www.whizzo.ca/simon/simon94_99.html |archive-date=September 24, 2010 }}</ref> The musical tells the story of real-life Puerto Rican youth [[Salvador Agron]], who wore a cape while committing two murders in 1959 New York, and went on to become a writer in prison. Featuring [[Marc Anthony]] as the young Agron and [[Rubén Blades]] as the older Agron, the play received terrible reviews and very poor box office receipts from the very beginning, and closed on March 28 after just 68 performances; a failure that reportedly cost Simon 11 million dollars.

Simon recorded an album of songs from the show, which was released in November 1997. It was received with very mixed reviews, though many critics praised the combination of [[doo-wop]], [[rockabilly]] and [[Caribbean music]] that the album reflected. In commercial terms, ''[[Songs from The Capeman]]'' was a failure; Simon missed the Top 40 of the ''Billboard'' charts for the first time in his career. The cast album was never released on CD but eventually became available online.

===1999–2007===
After the disaster of ''The Capeman'', Simon's career was again in an unexpected crisis. However, entering the new millennium, he maintained a respectable reputation, offering critically acclaimed new material and receiving commercial attention. In 1999, Simon embarked on a North American tour with [[Bob Dylan]], where each alternated as headline act with a "middle" section where they performed together, starting on the first of June and ending September 18. The collaboration was generally well-received, with just one critic, Seth Rogovoy from the ''Berkshire Eagle'', questioning the collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.berkshireweb.com/rogovoy/interviews/dylan716.html |title=Bob Dylan and Paul Simon: A mismatch made in heaven? by Seth Rogovoy |publisher=Berkshireweb.com |access-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720080030/http://www.berkshireweb.com/rogovoy/interviews/dylan716.html |archive-date=July 20, 2011 }}</ref>

In an attempt to return successfully to the music market, Simon wrote and recorded a new album very quickly, with ''[[You're the One (album)|You're the One]]'' arriving in October 2000. The album consisted mostly of folk-pop writing combined with foreign musical sounds, particularly grooves from North Africa. While not reaching the commercial heights of previous albums, it managed at least to reach both the British and American Top 20. It received favorable reviews and received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]]. He toured extensively for the album, and one performance in Paris was released to home video.

In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks]], Simon sang "Bridge Over Troubled Water" on ''[[America: A Tribute to Heroes]]'', a multi-network broadcast to benefit the September 11 Telethon Fund and performed "The Boxer" at the opening of the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' after September 11. In 2002, he wrote and recorded "[[Father and Daughter]]", the theme song for the animated family film ''[[The Wild Thornberrys Movie]]''. The track was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Song]]. In 2003, he participated on another Simon & Garfunkel reunion. One year later, Simon's studio albums were re-released both individually and together in a limited-edition nine-CD boxed set, ''Paul Simon: The Studio Recordings 1972–2000''.

At the time, Simon was already working on a new album with [[Brian Eno]] called ''[[Surprise (Paul Simon album)|Surprise]]'', which was released in May 2006. Most of the album was inspired by the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], the [[Iraq invasion]], and the war that followed. In personal terms, Simon was also inspired by the fact of having turned 60 in 2001, which he humorously referred to on "Old" from ''You're the One''.

''Surprise'' was a commercial hit, reaching No. 14 in the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and No. 4 in the UK. Most critics also praised the album, and many of them called it a "comeback". [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] from [[AllMusic]] wrote that "Simon doesn't achieve his comeback by reconnecting with the sound and spirit of his classic work; he has achieved it by being as restless and ambitious as he was at his popular and creative peak, which makes ''Surprise'' all the more remarkable." The album was supported with the successful ''[[Surprise Tour]]'' from May–November 2006.

In March 2004, Walter Yetnikoff published a book called ''Howling at the Moon'', in which he criticized Simon personally and for his tenuous business partnership with [[Columbia Records]] in the past.<ref name="Yetnikoff">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/04/books/sex-drugs-ego-music-mogul-s-swath-destruction-deposed-president-cbs-records.html |title= Sex, Drugs and Ego: A Music Mogul's Swath of Destruction; A Deposed President of CBS Records Chronicles His Debauchery and Detox |access-date=October 27, 2015 |date=March 4, 2004 |author=Lola Ogunnaike |newspaper=The New York Times}}</ref>

Simon is one of a small number of performers who are named as the [[copyright]] owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording). This noteworthy development was spearheaded by the [[Bee Gees]] after their successful $200&nbsp;million lawsuit against [[RSO Records]], which remains the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group. All of Simon's solo recordings, including those originally issued by [[Columbia Records]], are currently distributed by [[Sony Records]]' [[Legacy Recordings]] unit. His albums were issued by [[Warner Music Group]] until mid-2010. In mid-2010, Simon moved his catalog of solo work from [[Warner Bros. Records]] to [[Sony Records|Sony/Columbia Records]] where Simon and Garfunkel's catalog is. Simon's back catalog of solo recordings would be marketed by Sony Music's [[Legacy Recordings]] unit.

In February 2009, Simon performed back-to-back shows in New York City at the [[Beacon Theatre, New York|Beacon Theatre]], which had recently been renovated. Simon was reunited with Art Garfunkel at the first show as well as with the cast of ''The Capeman''; also playing in the band was ''Graceland'' bassist [[Bakithi Kumalo]]. In May 2009, Simon toured with Garfunkel in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. In October 2009, they appeared together at the 25th Anniversary of The Rock & Roll Hall of Fame concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City. The pair performed four of their most popular songs: "[[The Sound of Silence]]", "[[The Boxer]]", "[[Cecilia (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Cecilia]]", and "[[Bridge over Troubled Water (song)|Bridge Over Troubled Water]]."

Simon's album ''[[So Beautiful or So What]]''<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/books/review/Simon-t.html| work=The New York Times | first=Paul | last=Simon | title=Book Review – Finishing The Hat – By Stephen Sondheim | date=October 27, 2010}}</ref> was released on the [[Concord Music Group]] label on April 12, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.concordmusicgroup.com/albums/So-Beautiful-Or-So-What/ |title=Paul Simon, catalog and track list |publisher=Concordmusicgroup.com |date=April 12, 2011 |access-date= July 15, 2011}}</ref> The album received high marks from the artist, "It's the best work I've done in 20 years." It was reported that Simon attempted to have [[Bob Dylan]] guest on the album.

On November 10, 2010, Simon released a new song called "Getting Ready for Christmas Day". It premiered on [[National Public Radio]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Boilen |first=Bob |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/allsongs/2010/11/15/131334776/paul-simon-s-new-christmas-song |title=Premiere: New Music From Paul Simon : All Songs Considered Blog |publisher=NPR |date=November 16, 2010 |access-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref> and was included on the album ''[[So Beautiful or So What]]''. The song samples a 1941 sermon by [[J. M. Gates|the Rev. J.M.

In the premiere show of the final season of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' on September 10, 2010, Simon surprised [[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah]] and the audience with a song dedicated to Oprah and her show lasting 25 years (an update of a song he did for her show's 10th anniversary).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Paul-Simon-Surprise-Oprah-with-a-Special-Performance-Video |title=Paul Simon Surprise Oprah with a Special Performance – Video |publisher=Oprah.com |date=September 13, 2010 |access-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref>

Rounding off his 2011 World Tour, which included the United States, the U.K., the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany, Simon appeared at [[Ramat Gan Stadium]] in Israel in July 2011, making his first concert appearance in Israel since 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulsimon.com/news/paul-simon-concert-tour-starts-april-15th |title=Paul Simon Concert Tour Starts April 15th! &#124; The Official Paul Simon Site |date=April 14, 2011 |publisher=Paulsimon.com |access-date=June 5, 2012}}</ref> On September 11, 2011, Paul Simon performed "[[The Sound of Silence]]" at the [[National September 11 Memorial & Museum]], site of the [[World Trade Center site|World Trade Center]], on the 10th anniversary of the [[September 11 attacks]].

==Songwriting==
In an in-depth interview reprinted in ''[[American Songwriter]]'', Simon discusses the craft of songwriting with music journalist Tom Moon. In the interview, Simon explains the basic themes in his songwriting: love, family, and social commentary; as well as the overarching messages of religion, spirituality, and God in his lyrics. Simon goes on in the interview to explain the process of how he goes about writing songs, "The music always precedes the words. The words often come from the sound of the music and eventually evolve into coherent thoughts. Or incoherent thoughts. Rhythm plays a crucial part in the lyric-making as well. It's like a puzzle to find the right words to express what the music is saying."<ref name="American Songwriter">{{cite magazine | url= http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/10/interview-paul-simon-discusses-songwriter-and-songwriting/ | title= Interview: Paul Simon Discusses Songwriter And Songwriting | magazine= [[American Songwriter]] | access-date= June 1, 2012 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121022051428/http://www.americansongwriter.com/2011/10/interview-paul-simon-discusses-songwriter-and-songwriting/ | archive-date= October 22, 2012 | url-status= dead }}</ref>

==Projects==

===Music for Broadway===
In the late 1990s, Simon wrote and produced a [[Broadway musical]] called ''[[The Capeman]]'', which lost $11&nbsp;million during its 1998 run. In April 2008, the Brooklyn Academy of Music celebrated Paul Simon's works, and dedicated a week to ''Songs From the Capeman'' with a good portion of the show's songs performed by a cast of singers and the [[Spanish Harlem Orchestra]]. Simon himself appeared during the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music|BAM]] shows, performing "Trailways Bus" and "[[Late in the Evening]]". In August 2010, ''The Capeman'' was staged for three nights in the [[Delacorte Theatre]] in New York's Central Park. The production was directed by [[Diane Paulus]] and produced in conjunction with [[the Public Theater]].<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/18/theater/18capeman.html |title= 'Capeman' Outdoors, Starring the City | work= The New York Times | date= August 18, 2010 |first= Ben | last= Brantley | access-date= November 24, 2014}}</ref>

===Film and television===
Simon has also dabbled in acting. He played music producer Tony Lacey, a supporting character, in the 1977 [[Woody Allen]] feature film ''[[Annie Hall]]''. He wrote and starred in 1980's ''[[One-Trick Pony (film)|One Trick Pony]]'' as Jonah Levin, a journeyman rock and roller. Simon also wrote all the songs in the film. Paul Simon also appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' (the only episode to use only the songs of one songwriter, Simon). In 1990, he played the character of—appropriately enough—Simple Simon on the [[Disney Channel]] TV movie, ''[[Mother Goose Rock 'n' Rhyme]]''.

In 1978, Simon made a cameo appearance in the movie, ''[[The Rutles: All You Need Is Cash]]''.

He has been the subject of two films by [[Jeremy Marre]], the first on ''Graceland'', the second on ''The Capeman''.

On November 18, 2008, Simon was a guest on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' promoting his book ''Lyrics 1964–2008''. After an interview with [[Stephen Colbert]], Simon performed "American Tune".

Simon performed a [[Stevie Wonder]] song at [[the White House]] in 2009 at an event honoring Wonder's musical career and contributions.

In May 2009, ''The Library of Congress: Paul Simon and Friends Live Concert'' was released on DVD, via [[Shout! Factory]]. The PBS concert was recorded in 2007.

Simon appeared at the [[Glastonbury Festival 2011]] in England.

===''Saturday Night Live''===
Simon has appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL''), either as host or musical guest, 14 times. On one appearance in the late 1980s, he worked with the politician who shared his name, Illinois Senator [[Paul Simon (politician)|Paul Simon]].<ref>[http://www.mcleansboro.com/news/articles/04-121103.php Former Sen. Paul Simon Dies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831231611/http://www.mcleansboro.com/news/articles/04-121103.php |date=August 31, 2006 }} Fox News Channel</ref> Simon's most recent ''SNL'' appearance on a Saturday night was on the October 13, 2018, episode hosted by Seth Meyers. Prior to that, he appeared in the March 9, 2013, episode hosted by [[Justin Timberlake]] as a member of the [[Five-Timers Club]]. In one ''SNL'' skit from 1986 (when he was promoting ''Graceland''), Simon plays himself, waiting in line with a friend to get into a movie. He amazes his friend by remembering intricate details about prior meetings with passers-by, but draws a complete blank when approached by [[Art Garfunkel]], despite the latter's numerous memory prompts. Simon appeared alongside [[George Harrison]] as musical guest on the [[Thanksgiving Day]] episode of ''SNL'' (November 20, 1976). The two performed "[[Here Comes the Sun]]" and "[[Homeward Bound (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Homeward Bound]]" together, while Simon performed "[[50 Ways to Leave Your Lover]]" solo earlier in the show. On that episode, Simon opened the show performing "Still Crazy After All These Years" in a turkey outfit, since Thanksgiving was the following week. About halfway through the song, Simon tells the band to stop playing because of his embarrassment. After giving a frustrated speech to the audience, he leaves the stage, backed by applause. [[Lorne Michaels]] greets him positively backstage, but Simon is still upset, yelling at him because of the humiliating turkey outfit. This is one of ''SNL''{{'}}s most played sketches. Simon closed the 40th anniversary SNL show on February 15, 2015, with a performance of "Still Crazy After All These Years", sans turkey outfit. Simon also played a snippet of "[[I've Just Seen a Face]]" with Sir [[Paul McCartney]] during the special's introductory sequence.
Simon was the musical guest on the October 13, 2018 episode, with host Seth Meyers (in addition they showed much of the Thanksgiving episode from 1976 described above as the Prime Time special from 10-11pm). It was also his 77th birthday.

On September 29, 2001, Simon made a special appearance on the first ''SNL'' to air after the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]]. On that show, he performed "[[The Boxer]]" to the audience and the NYC firefighters and police officers. He is also a friend of former ''SNL'' star [[Chevy Chase]], who appeared in his video for "[[You Can Call Me Al]]" lip synching the song while Simon looks disgruntled and mimes backing vocals and the playing of various instruments beside him. Chase would also appear in Simon's 1991 video for the song "Proof" alongside [[Steve Martin]]. He is a close friend of ''SNL'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]], who produced the 1977 TV show ''The Paul Simon Special'', as well as the Simon and Garfunkel concert in Central Park four years later. Simon and Lorne Michaels were the subjects of a 2006 episode of the Sundance Channel documentary series, ''[[Iconoclasts (TV series)|Iconoclasts]]''.

On being notified of the honor, Simon said, "I am grateful to be the recipient of the Gershwin Prize and doubly honored to be the first. I look forward to spending an evening in the company of artists I admire at the award ceremony in May. I can think of a few who have expressed my words and music far better than I. I'm excited at the prospect of that happening again. It's a songwriter's dream come true." Among the performers who paid tribute to Simon were Stevie Wonder, [[Alison Krauss]], [[Jerry Douglas]], [[Lyle Lovett]], [[James Taylor]], [[Dianne Reeves]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Yolanda Adams]], and [[Ladysmith Black Mambazo]].

==Personal life==
When Simon moved to England in 1964, he met Kathleen Mary "Kathy" Chitty (born 1947) on April 12 at the first English folk club he played, the Railway Inn Folk Club in [[Brentwood, Essex]], where Chitty worked part-time selling tickets. She was 16 and he was 22 when they began a relationship. Later that year they visited the U.S. together, touring around mainly by bus.<ref>Jackson, Laura. ''Paul Simon: The Definitive Biography'' ([[Citadel Press]], 2004), {{ISBN|978-0-8065-2539-6}}, p. 65.</ref>

Kathy returned to England on her own, with Simon returning to her some weeks later. When Simon returned to the U.S. with the growing success of "The Sounds of Silence", Kathy, who was quite shy,<ref>Jackson, Laura. ''Paul Simon: The Definitive Biography'', p. 58.</ref> wanted no part of the success and fame that awaited Simon and they ended their relationship.<ref name="Jackson, Laura p.95">Jackson, Laura. ''Paul Simon: The Definitive Biography'', p. 95.</ref> She is mentioned by name in at least two of his songs: "[[The Paul Simon Songbook|Kathy's Song]]" and "[[America (Simon & Garfunkel song)|America]]", and is referred to in "[[Homeward Bound (Simon & Garfunkel song)|Homeward Bound]]" and "[[The Late Great Johnny Ace]]". There is a photo of Simon and Kathy on the cover of his 1965 album ''[[The Paul Simon Songbook]]''.{{cn|date=December 2021}}

Simon has been married three times, first to Peggy Harper in 1969. They had a son, [[Harper Simon]] in 1972, and divorced in 1975. Simon wrote about this relationship in the song "Train in the Distance" from his 1983 album ''[[Hearts and Bones]]''.<ref name="biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.paul-simon.info/PHP/biography.php|title=The Paul Simon biography|website=paul-simon.info|access-date=March 19, 2018}}</ref> 

Simon's 1972 song, "Run That Body Down", from his second solo album, casually mentions both himself and his then-wife ("Peg") by name. Paul and Peggy, misheard as Al and Betty by [[Pierre Boulez]], are also referenced in Paul Simon's 1986 hit single "You Can Call Me Al".{{cn|date=December 2021}}

In the late 1970s, Simon lived in New York City next door to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' creator [[Lorne Michaels]], who has been described as Simon's "best friend" during the period.<ref name="Vulture-Fisher">{{cite news |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/carrie-fisher-book-excerpt-john-belushi-relationship.html |title=When Carrie Fisher Hung with the SNL Crowd |first=Sheila |last=Weller |date=November 12, 2019 |access-date=November 13, 2019}}</ref>

Simon married singer [[Edie Brickell]] on May 30, 1992.

==Philanthropy==
Simon is a proponent of music education for children.
In 1970, after recording his "Bridge Over Troubled Water", at the invitation of the NYU's [[Tisch School of the Arts]], Simon held auditions for a young songwriter's workshop. Advertised in ''[[The Village Voice]]'', the auditions brought hundreds of hopefuls to perform for Simon. Among the six teenage songwriters Simon selected for tutelage were [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Tommy Mandel]] and rock/beat poet Joe Linus, with [[The Roches|Maggie and Terre Roche]] (the Roche Sisters), who later sang back-up for Simon, joining the workshop in progress through an impromptu appearance.

Simon invited the six teens to experience recording at Columbia studios with engineer [[Roy Halee]]. During these sessions, [[Bob Dylan]] was downstairs recording the album ''[[Self Portrait (Bob Dylan album)|Self-Portrait]]'', which included a version of Simon's "[[The Boxer]]". Violinist [[Isaac Stern]] also visited the group with a [[CBS]] film crew, speaking to the young musicians about lyrics and music after Joe Linus performed his song "Circus Lion" for Stern.

Manchester later paid homage to Simon with her recorded song "Ode to Paul". Other musicians Simon has mentored include [[Nick Laird-Clowes]], who co-founded the band [[The Dream Academy]]. Laird-Clowes has credited Simon with helping to shape the band's biggest hit, "[[Life in a Northern Town]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theacf.com/dreamac/article_latimes86.html |title=at |publisher=Theacf.com |access-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725071606/http://theacf.com/dreamac/article_latimes86.html |archive-date=July 25, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2003, Simon signed on as a supporter of [[Little Kids Rock]], a nonprofit organization that provides free musical instruments and free lessons to children in public schools in the U.S. He sits on the organization's board of directors as an honorary member.

Simon is also a major benefactor and one of the co-founders, with [[Irwin Redlener]], of the Children's Health Project and The Children's Health Fund<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.childrenshealthfund.org/ |title=CHF – The Children's Health Fund |publisher=Childrenshealthfund.org |access-date=July 15, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/052597/mobile.htm |title=Mobile health units bring medical care to homeless |publisher=Lubbockonline.com |access-date=July 15, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320090429/http://lubbockonline.com/news/052597/mobile.htm |archive-date=March 20, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> which started by creating specially equipped "buses" to take medical care to children in medically underserved areas, urban and rural. Their first bus was in the impoverished [[South Bronx]] of New York City, but they now operate in 12 states, including on the [[Gulf Coast]]. It has expanded greatly, partnering with major hospitals, local public schools and medical schools and advocating policy for children's health and medical care.

In May 2012, Paul Simon performed at a benefit dinner for the Turkana Basin Institute in New York City, raising more than $2&nbsp;million for [[Richard Leakey]]'s research institute in Africa.<ref>{{cite web|first= Frank |last= Eltman |url=https://news.yahoo.com/scientist-evolution-debate-soon-history-155252505.html |title=Scientist: Evolution debate will soon be history|publisher=Yahoo!

For his 2019 performance at San Francisco's [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival]], Simon donated his appearance fee to the [[San Francisco Parks Trust|San Francisco Parks Alliance]] and [[Friends of the Urban Forest]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kqed.org/arts/13863711/toro-y-moi-shows-oakland-love-paul-simon-dazzles-outside-lands-day-3-highlights |title=Toro y Moi Shows Oakland Love, Paul Simon Dazzles: Outside Lands Day 3 Highlights |author=Nastia Voynovskaya |access-date=August 12, 2019 |publisher=KQED}}</ref>
