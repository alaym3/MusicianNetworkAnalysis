== Biography ==
P Money began his career within the crew Fatal Assassins along with MCs such as Little Dee, Blacks and Firmer D. During these times P Money was known for his fast, skippy flow which created plenty of hype when attending [[pirate radio]] shows. He attended many classic studio sets such as those from the Hazardous Sessions series and also Fuck Radio volume 5. He gained a lot of positive attention with the massive single "What Did He Say", which has since been released on Vinyl and digital download, as well as the title being used as a [[slogan]] for a line of T-shirts. He is currently a member of the crew OGs and was involved with the collective's first release, OG Season.

P Money Is Power – P Money's debut album. The album received mixed reviews, with some people doubting the strength of some productions on the CD. However praise has been given to tracks such as the remix of "What Did He Say" and "Sounds and Gimmicks".{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Money Over Everyone – Money Over Everyone is the 2nd purchasable release from South London artist P Money. It follows on from 2008's P Money Is Power which fans and critics were unsure of, with many doubting the strength of some productions and the inclusion of some tracks. This release features more notable producers however, such as Maniac, Scratcha & Rude Kid. This CD also gives fans the opportunity to hear what Grime MC's can do on dubstep with nods to "Left The Room" and "Look How Many". There is still input from the lesser known talents, SNK, Mastermind & Royal-T are amongst those and on the MC support there are hands lent from Little Dee, Frisco, Wiley plus more. "Fruits and Veg" is a popular song containing the lyrics only previously heard on one [[Logan Sama]] show, "Crazy" leans slightly into the R & G subgenre and "They Don't Understand" is the emotional bass filled banger with Little Dee.

In 2010, he collaborated with [[kiss (UK radio station)|Kiss 100's]] DJ Swerve, who remixed Marco Del Horno's Ho!, to release Ho Riddim<ref>YouTube Music Video {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYBn7canZWg |title=DJ Swerve ft.

At the tail end of 2010 and in 2011, P Money featured on two singles which hit the charts, the first being "[[Pow 2011]]"<ref>YouTube Music Video {{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzU5Q4uI3iw |title=Lethal Bizzle ft.

P Money released 'Boo You' alongside Blacks on [[Butterz]] in May 2011, the first and one of the few vocal releases on the label.

In May 2014, P Money infamously 'clashed' controversial and storied North London MC [[Big H]] at [[Lord of the Mics]] 6,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whatsgoodonline.co.uk/latest/lord-of-the-mics-6-p-money-vs-big-h/ |title=P Money Vs Big H – Lord of the Mics 6 |publisher=What's Good? | date=1 October 2014 }}</ref> a Grime-focused battle series curated by [[Jammer (MC)|Jammer]], a ubiquitous figure within the Grime scene and member of influential Grime crew [[Boy Better Know]]. The event, despite being advertised as one of the most noteworthy events in the genre's short history, was ultimately met with widespread disappointment by fans, as Big H left the stage, citing unsatisfactory payment, before the 'clash' could reach its intended conclusion. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://sbtv.co.uk/2014/05/lotm6-p-money-vs-big-h-review-2/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-05-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524113417/http://sbtv.co.uk/2014/05/lotm6-p-money-vs-big-h-review-2/ |archive-date=24 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
