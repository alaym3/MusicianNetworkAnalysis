'''Edith Wharton''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|hw|ɔr|t|ən}}; born '''Edith Newbold Jones'''; January 24, 1862 – August 11, 1937) was an [[American novelist]], [[short story]] writer, and [[designer]]. Wharton drew upon her insider's knowledge of the upper class New York "aristocracy" to realistically portray the lives and morals of the [[Gilded Age]]. In 1921, she became the first woman to win the [[Pulitzer Prize]] in Literature, for her novel ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''. She was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1996.<ref>[https://www.womenofthehall.org/inductee/edith-wharton/ National Women's Hall of Fame, Edith Wharton]</ref> Among her other well known works are ''[[The House of Mirth]]'' and the novella ''[[Ethan Frome]]''.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Edward Harrison May - Edith Wharton - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Portrait of Wharton as a girl by [[Edward Harrison May]] (1870)]]

Edith Wharton was born Edith Newbold Jones on January 24, 1862 to George Frederic Jones and Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander at their brownstone at 14 West Twenty-third Street in [[New York City]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=16}}{{sfn|Dwight|1994|pp=12–13}} To her friends and family she was known as "Pussy Jones".{{sfn|Minkel|2012}} She had two older brothers, Frederic Rhinelander, 16 years older, and Henry Edward, 12 years older.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=16}} She was [[baptized]] April 20, 1862, [[Easter Sunday]], at [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=16}}

Wharton's paternal family, the Joneses, were a very wealthy and socially prominent family having made their money in real estate.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=21}} The saying "[[keeping up with the Joneses]]" is said to refer to her father's family.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=22}}{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=216}} She was related to the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck|Rensselaers]], the most prestigious of the old [[patroon]] families, who had received land grants from the former Dutch government of New York and New Jersey. Her father's first cousin was [[Caroline Schermerhorn Astor]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=34}} She had a lifelong friendship with her niece, the landscape architect [[Beatrix Farrand]] of [[Reef Point Estate|Reef Point]] in Bar Harbor, Maine. Fort Stevens in New York was named for Wharton's maternal great-grandfather, [[Ebenezer Stevens]], a [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] hero and General.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=18}}

Wharton was born during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; however, in describing her family life Wharton does not mention the war except that their travels to Europe after the war were due to the depreciation of American currency.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=16}}{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=7–8}} From 1866 to 1872, the Jones family visited [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], and [[Spain]].<ref name="Chronology">{{cite web |title=Chronology |website=The Mount: Edith Wharton's Home |url=http://www.edithwharton.org/edith-wharton/chronology/}}</ref> During her travels, the young Edith became fluent in [[French (language)|French]], [[German (language)|German]], and [[Italian (language)|Italian]]. At the age of nine, she suffered from [[typhoid fever]], which nearly killed her, while the family was at a spa in the [[Black Forest]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=16}} After the family returned to the United States in 1872, they spent their winters in New York City and their summers in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].<ref name="Chronology"/> While in Europe, she was educated by tutors and [[governess]]es. She rejected the standards of fashion and [[etiquette]] that were expected of young girls at the time, which were intended to allow women to marry well and to be put on display at balls and parties. She considered these fashions superficial and oppressive. Edith wanted more education than she received, so she read from her father's library and from the libraries of her father's friends.<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc">{{cite book|last1=Baym|first1=Nina|year=2013|title=The Norton Anthology of American Literature |publisher=W. W. Norton & Company|isbn=978-0-393-91885-4|edition=8th}}</ref> Her mother forbade her to read novels until she was married, and Edith obeyed this command.{{sfn|Lee|2008}}

===Early writing===
[[File:Edith Wharton by Edward Harrison May.jpg|thumb|upright|Edith Wharton by Edward Harrison May]]

Wharton wrote and told stories from an early age.{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=13–14}} When her family moved to Europe and she was just four or five she started what she called "making up."{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=13–14}} She invented stories for her family and walked with an open book, turning the pages as if reading while improvising a story.{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=13–14}} Wharton began writing poetry and fiction as a young girl, and attempted to write her first novel at age eleven.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=36}} Her mother's criticism quashed her ambition and she turned to poetry.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=36}} At age 15, her first published work appeared, a translation of a German poem "Was die Steine Erzählen" ("What the Stones Tell") by [[Heinrich Karl Brugsch]], for which she was paid $50. Her family did not want her name to appear in print since writing was not considered a proper occupation for a society woman of her time. Consequently, the poem was published under the name of a friend's father, E. A. Washburn, a cousin of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] who supported women's education.{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=35}} In 1877, at the age of 15, she secretly wrote a 30,000 word [[novella]] ''Fast and Loose''. In 1878 her father arranged for a collection of two dozen original poems and five translations, ''Verses,'' to be privately published.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=43}} Wharton published a poem under a pseudonym in the ''New York World'' in 1879.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=44}} In 1880 she had five poems published anonymously in the ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'', an important literary magazine.{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=38}} Despite these early successes, she was not encouraged by her family or her social circle, and though she continued to write, she did not publish anything more until her poem "The Last Giustiniani" was published in ''Scribner's Magazine'' in October 1889.{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=40}}

===Member of Society and Debutante===
Between 1880 and 1890 Wharton put her writing aside to participate in the social rituals of the New York upper classes. Wharton keenly observed the social changes happening around her which appeared later in her writing.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=47}} Wharton officially came out as a debutante to society in 1879.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=58}} Wharton was allowed to bare her shoulders and wear her hair up for the first time at a December dance given by a Society matron, Anna Morton.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=58}} Wharton began a courtship with Henry Leyden Stevens, the son of a wealthy businessman. Henry's father was Paran Stevens, a hotelier and real estate investor from rural New Hampshire. His sister Minnie Stevens Paget married [[Arthur Paget (British Army officer)|Arthur Paget]]. {{sfn|Lee|2008|p=60}} Wharton's family did not approve of Stevens.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=60}}

In the middle of Wharton's debutante season, the Jones family returned to Europe in 1881 for Wharton's father's health.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=61}} In spite of this, George Frederic Jones, died  of a stroke in Cannes in 1882.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}} Stevens was with the Wharton family in Europe during this time.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=61}} Wharton and her mother returned to the United States and Wharton continued her courtship with Stevens, announcing their engagement in August 1882.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=61}} The month the two were to marry, the engagement abruptly ended.{{sfn|Lewis|1975|pp=44–47}}

Wharton's mother, Lucretia Stevens Rhinelander, moved back to Paris in 1883 and lived there until her death in 1901.{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=7–8}}

===1880s–1900s===
[[File:The Mount from the Flower Garden by David Dashiell.jpg|thumb|left|[[The Mount (Lenox, Massachusetts)|The Mount]], 2006]] 

On April 29, 1885,<ref>New York, New York, Marriage Index 1866–1937</ref> at age 23, Wharton married Edward Robbins (Teddy) Wharton, who was 12 years her senior, at the [[Trinity Chapel Complex]] in Manhattan.{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=74–75}}<ref>U.S., Newspaper Extractions from the Northeast, 1704–1930</ref> From a well-established Boston family, he was a sportsman and a gentleman of the same social class and shared her love of travel. The Whartons set up house at Pencraig Cottage in Newport.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=81}} They then bought and moved to Land's End on the other side of Newport in 1893 for $80,000.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=81}} Wharton decorated Land's End with the help of designer [[Ogden Codman]]. The Whartons purchased their New York home, 884 Park Avenue, in 1897.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=82}} They traveled abroad from February to June between 1886 and 1897–mostly to Italy, but also to Paris and England.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=82}} From her marriage onwards, three interests came to dominate Wharton's life: American houses, writing, and Italy.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=81}}

From the late 1880s until 1902, Teddy Wharton suffered from acute depression, and the couple ceased their extensive travel.<ref name="Davis">{{Harvnb|Davis|2007}}</ref> At that time his depression manifested as a more serious disorder, after which they lived almost exclusively at their estate [[The Mount (Lenox, Massachusetts)|The Mount]] in Lenox, Massachusetts. During those same years, Wharton herself was said to suffer from bouts of depression and health issues with asthma.{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=78–81}}

In 1908 her husband's mental state was determined to be incurable. In the same year, she began an affair with [[William Morton Fullerton|Morton Fullerton]], a journalist for ''[[The Times]]'', in whom she found an intellectual partner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npg.si.edu/exh/wharton/whar3.htm |title= Edith Wharton's World, Portrait of People and Places| publisher = National Portrait Gallery |access-date=23 Dec 2009 | location = [[United States|US]]}}</ref> She divorced Edward Wharton in 1913 after 28 years of marriage.<ref name="Davis"/> Around the same time, Edith was beset with harsh criticisms leveled by the [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalist writers]].

[[File:Edith Wharton as a young woman, ca. 1889 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Edith Wharton as a young woman, ca. 1889]]

In addition to novels, Wharton wrote at least 85 short stories.<ref name="W. W. Norton & Company, Inc"/> She was also a [[garden designer]], an [[interior design]]er, and a taste-maker of her time. She wrote several design books, including her first major published work, ''[[The Decoration of Houses]]'' (1897), co-authored by [[Ogden Codman]]. Another of her "home and garden" books is the generously illustrated ''Italian Villas and Their Gardens'' of 1904.

===Travels and life abroad===

She eventually crossed the Atlantic 60 times.{{sfn|Wright|1995|pp=xvii–xviii}} In Europe, her primary destinations were Italy, France, and England. She also went to Morocco in North Africa. She wrote many books about her travels, including ''Italian Backgrounds'' and ''A Motor-Flight through France.''

Her husband Edward Wharton shared her love of travel and for many years they spent at least four months of each year abroad, mainly in Italy. Their friend Egerton Winthrop accompanied them on many journeys in Italy.{{sfn|Wright|1995|p=3}} In 1888, the Whartons and their friend James Van Alen took a cruise through the [[Aegean islands]]. Wharton was 26. The trip cost the Whartons $10,000 and lasted four months.{{sfn|Lewis|1975|p={{pn|date=May 2021}}}} She kept a travel journal during this trip that was thought to be lost but was later published as ''The Cruise of the Vanadis'', now considered her earliest known travel writing.{{sfn|Wright|1995|p=17}}

[[File:Land’s End, Newport, RI.jpg|thumb|left|Land's End, Newport, RI]]

In 1897, Edith Wharton purchased Land's End in Newport, Rhode Island, from [[Robert Livingston Beeckman]], a former U.S. Open Tennis Championship runner-up who became governor of Rhode Island. At the time, Wharton described the main house as "incurably ugly." Wharton agreed to pay $80,000 for the property, and spent thousands more to alter the home's facade, decorate the interior, and landscape the grounds.

[[File:The House of Mirth page of original manuscript Edith Wharton.jpg|thumb|upright|Page from original [[manuscript]] of ''[[The House of Mirth]]'', in Edith Wharton's hand]]

In 1902, Wharton designed [[The Mount (Lenox, Massachusetts)|The Mount]], her estate in [[Lenox, Massachusetts]], which survives today as an example of her design principles. She wrote several of her novels there, including ''[[The House of Mirth]]'' (1905), the first of many chronicles of life in old New York. At The Mount, she entertained the cream of American literary society, including her close friend, novelist [[Henry James]], who described the estate as "a delicate French chateau mirrored in a Massachusetts pond".{{sfn|Benstock|1994|pp=129–130}} Although she spent many months traveling in Europe nearly every year with her friend, Egerton Winthrop ([[John Winthrop]]'s descendant), The Mount was her primary residence until 1911.{{sfn|Lewis|1975|p={{pn|date=May 2021}}}} When living there and while traveling abroad, Wharton was usually driven to appointments by her longtime [[chauffeur]] and friend Charles Cook, a native of nearby [[South Lee, Massachusetts]].{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=143}}<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JYKs6vJG678C&pg=PA238 |quote=Photograph of Edith Wharton, Teddy Wharton, Henry James and Chauffeur Charles Cook|title= A Historical Guide to Edith Wharton|first= Carol J. |last=Singley |publisher=Oxford University Press|year= 2003|page=238|isbn=0-19-513591-1}}</ref> When her marriage deteriorated, she decided to move permanently to France, living first at 53 Rue de Varenne, [[Paris]], in an apartment that belonged to [[George Washington Vanderbilt II]].

Wharton was preparing to vacation for the summer when World War I broke out. Though many fled Paris, she moved back to her Paris apartment on the Rue de Varenne and for four years was a tireless and ardent supporter of the French war effort.{{sfn|Dwight|1994|p=183}} One of the first causes she undertook in August 1914 was the opening of a workroom for unemployed women; here they were fed and paid one franc a day. What began with 30 women soon doubled to 60, and their sewing business began to thrive.{{sfn|Dwight|1994|pp=183-184}} When the Germans invaded Belgium in the fall of 1914 and Paris was flooded with Belgian refugees, she helped to set up the American Hostels for Refugees, which managed to get them shelter, meals, and clothes, and eventually created an employment agency to help them find work.{{sfn|Dwight|1994|pp=188-189}} She collected more than $100,000 on their behalf.{{sfn|Wolff|1995|p=253}} In early 1915 she organized the Children of Flanders Rescue Committee, which gave shelter to nearly 900 Belgian refugees who had fled when their homes were bombed by the Germans.{{sfn|Dwight|1994|p=190}}

Aided by her influential connections in the French government, she and her long-time friend [[Walter Van Rensselaer Berry|Walter Berry]] (then president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Paris), were among the few foreigners in France allowed to travel to the front lines during World War I. She and Berry made five journeys between February and August 1915, which Wharton described in a series of articles that were first published in ''Scribner's Magazine'' and later as ''[[Fighting France: From Dunkerque to Belfort]]'', which became an American bestseller.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=486}}<ref>''Edith Wharton'' p.&nbsp;486. New York: Alfred A. Knopf. {{ISBN|978-0-375-40004-9}}</ref> Travelling by car, Wharton and Berry drove through the war zone, viewing one decimated French village after another. She visited the trenches, and was within earshot of artillery fire. She wrote, "We woke to a noise of guns closer and more incessant&nbsp;... and when we went out into the streets it seemed as if, overnight, a new army had sprung out of the ground".<ref>"In Argonne", Chapter 2 of ''Fighting France: From Dunkerque to Belfort'', published in ''Edith Wharton Abroad: Selected Travel Writings, 1888–1920'', p. 150. New York: St. Martin's Griffin. {{ISBN|0-312-16120-4}}</ref>

Throughout the war she worked tirelessly in charitable efforts for refugees, the injured, the unemployed, and the displaced. She was a "heroic worker on behalf of her adopted country".{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=454}} On April 18, 1916, [[Raymond Poincaré]], the then-President of France appointed her Chevalier of the [[Legion of Honour]], the country's highest award, in recognition of her dedication to the war effort.{{sfn|Wolff|1995|p=253}}{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=9}} Her relief work included setting up workrooms for unemployed French women, organizing concerts to provide work for musicians, raising tens of thousands of dollars for the war effort, and opening [[tuberculosis]] hospitals. In 1915 Wharton edited ''[[The Book of the Homeless]],'' which included essays, art, poetry, and musical scores by many major contemporary European and American artists, including Henry James, [[Joseph Conrad]], [[William Dean Howells]], [[Anna de Noailles]], Jean Cocteau, and [[Walter Gay]], among others. Wharton proposed the book to her publisher, Scribner's. She handled all of the business arrangements, lined up contributors, and translated the French entries into English. Theodore Roosevelt wrote a two-page introduction in which he praised Wharton's effort and urged Americans to support the war.{{sfn|Dwight|1994|pp=202–203}} She also kept up her own work during the war, continuing to write novels, short stories, and poems, as well as reporting for ''The New York Times'' and keeping up her enormous correspondence.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=450}} Wharton urged Americans to support the war effort and encouraged America to enter the war.{{sfn|Dwight|1994|p=201}} She wrote the popular romantic novel ''Summer'' in 1916, the war novella, ''The Marne'', in 1918, and ''A Son at the Front'' in 1919, (though it was not published until 1923). When the war ended, she watched the Victory Parade from the Champs Elysees' balcony of a friend's apartment. After four years of intense effort, she decided to leave Paris in favor of the peace and quiet of the countryside. Wharton settled {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} north of Paris in [[Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt]], buying an 18th-century house on seven acres of land which she called Pavillon Colombe. She lived there in summer and autumn for the rest of her life. She spent winters and springs on the French Riviera at Sainte Claire du Vieux Chateau in [[Hyères]].{{sfn|Dwight|1994|p=210}}

Wharton was a committed supporter of [[French imperialism]], describing herself as a "rabid imperialist", and the war solidified her political views.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wegener|first= Fredrick |title="Rabid Imperialist"': Edith Wharton and the Obligations of Empire in Modern American Fiction|journal= American Literature |volume=72|issue= 4|pages=783–812|date=December 2000|doi=10.1215/00029831-72-4-783|s2cid= 162758720 }}</ref> After the war, she traveled to Morocco as the guest of Resident General [[Hubert Lyautey]] and wrote a book, titled ''In Morocco'', about her experiences. Wharton's writing on her Moroccan travels is full of praise for the French administration and for Lyautey and his wife in particular.

During the post-war years, she divided her time between [[Hyères]] and [[Provence]], where she finished ''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' in 1920. She returned to the United States only once after the war to receive an honorary doctorate from Yale University in 1923.

===Later years===
''[[The Age of Innocence]]'' (1920) won the [[1921 Pulitzer Prize]] for literature,<ref>{{cite book|last= Nelson|first= Randy F.|title= The Almanac of American Letters|location= Los Altos, California|publisher= William Kaufmann, Inc.|year= 1981|page= [https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00nels/page/9 9]|isbn= 0-86576-008-X|url= https://archive.org/details/almanacofamerica00nels/page/9}}</ref> making Wharton the first woman to win the award. The three fiction judges – literary critic [[Stuart Sherman|Stuart Pratt Sherman]], literature professor [[Robert Morss Lovett]], and novelist [[Hamlin Garland]] – voted to give the prize to [[Sinclair Lewis]] for his satire ''Main Street'', but Columbia University's advisory board, led by conservative university president [[Nicholas Murray Butler]], overturned their decision and awarded the prize to ''The Age of Innocence''.<ref>"Reader's Almanac: A Controversial Pulitzer Prize Brings Edith Wharton and Sinclair Lewis Together." Library of America, 28 June 2011. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.</ref> She was also nominated for the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1927, 1928, and 1930.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show_people.php?id=10128|title=Nomination Database – Literature|website=www.nobelprize.org|access-date=14 September 2017}}</ref>

Wharton was friend and confidante to many gifted intellectuals of her time: [[Henry James]], Sinclair Lewis, [[Jean Cocteau]], and [[André Gide]] were all her guests at one time or another. [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Bernard Berenson]], and [[Kenneth Clark]] were valued friends as well. Particularly notable was her meeting with [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], described by the editors of her letters as "one of the better known failed encounters in the American literary annals". She spoke fluent French, Italian, and German, and many of her books were published in both French and English.

In 1934 Wharton's [[autobiography]] ''A Backward Glance'' was published. In the view of Judith E. Funston, writing on Edith Wharton in ''American National Biography'', <blockquote>What is most notable about ''A Backward Glance,'' however, is what it does not tell: her criticism of Lucretia Jones [her mother], her difficulties with Teddy, and her affair with Morton Fullerton, which did not come to light until her papers, deposited in Yale's [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library|Beinecke Rare Book Room and Manuscript Library]], were opened in 1968.<ref>Judith E. Funston, "Edith Wharton", in ''American National Biography''; New York: Oxford University Press, 1999; Vol. 23, pp. 111–112. {{ISBN|0-19-512802-8}}.</ref></blockquote>

===Death===
On June 1, 1937, Wharton was at the French country home of [[Ogden Codman]], where she was at work on a revised edition of ''The Decoration of Houses,'' when she suffered a heart attack and collapsed.{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=86}}

[[File:Gardens at Pavilion Colombe Edith Wharton's villa.jpg|thumb|Wharton's ''Le Pavilion Colombe'', [[Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt]], France]]

She died of a [[stroke]] on August 11, 1937 at ''Le Pavillon Colombe'', her 18th-century house on [[Rue de Montmorency]] in [[Saint-Brice-sous-Forêt]]. She died at 5:30&nbsp;p.m., but her death was not known in Paris. At her bedside was her friend, [[Elisina Palamidessi de Castelvecchio Tyler|Mrs. Royall Tyler]].<ref>"Edith Wharton, 75, Is Dead in France." The New York Times, 13 Aug. 1937. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.</ref> Wharton was buried in the American Protestant section of the [[Cimetière des Gonards]] in Versailles, "with all the honors owed a war hero and a chevalier of the Legion of Honor...a group of some one hundred friends sang a verse of the hymn 'O Paradise'..."{{sfn|Benstock|1994|p=456}}

==Writing==

===Career===
Despite not publishing her first novel until she was forty, Wharton became an extraordinarily productive writer. In addition to
her 15 novels, seven novellas, and eighty-five short stories, she published poetry, books on design, travel, literary and cultural criticism, and a memoir.{{sfn|Benstock|1994}}

In 1873, Wharton wrote a [[short story]] and gave it to her mother to read. Her mother criticized the story, so Wharton decided to write only [[poetry]]. While she constantly sought her mother's approval and love, it was rare that she received either. From the start, the relationship with her mother was a troubled one.<ref>Armitage, Robert. "Edith Wharton, A Writing Life: Childhood." New York Public Library, 6 May 2013. Web. 11 Mar. 2015.</ref> Before she was 15, she wrote ''Fast and Loose'' (1877). In her youth, she wrote about society. Her central [[theme (narrative)|theme]]s came from her experiences with her parents. She was very critical of her work and wrote public reviews criticizing it. She also wrote about her own experiences with life. "Intense Love’s Utterance" is a poem written about Henry Stevens.{{sfn|Lewis|1975|p={{pn|date=May 2021}}}}

In 1889, she sent out three poems for publication. They were sent to ''[[Charles Scribner's Sons|Scribner's]]'', ''Harper’s'' and ''[[The Century Magazine|Century]]''. [[Edward L. Burlingame]] published "The Last Giustiniani" for ''[[Scribner's Magazine|Scribner’s]]''. It was not until Wharton was 29 that her first [[short story]] was published. "Mrs. Manstey's View" had very little success, and it took her more than a year to publish another story. She completed "The Fullness of Life" following her annual European trip with Teddy. Burlingame was critical of this story but Wharton did not want to make edits to it. This story, along with many others, speaks about her marriage. She sent ''Bunner Sisters'' to Scribner's in 1892. Burlingame wrote back that it was too long for Scribner's to publish. This story is believed to be based on an experience she had as a child. It did not see publication until 1916 and is included in the collection called ''Xingu''.
After a visit with her friend, [[Paul Bourget]], she wrote "The Good May Come" and "The Lamp of Psyche". "The Lamp of Psyche" was a [[Comedy|comical]] story with verbal wit and sorrow. After "Something Exquisite" was rejected by Burlingame, she lost confidence in herself. She started "[[travel writing]]" in 1894.{{sfn|Lewis|1975|p={{pn|date=May 2021}}}}

In 1901, Wharton wrote a two-act play called ''Man of Genius''. This play was about an English man who was having an affair with his secretary. The play was rehearsed but was never produced. Another 1901 play, ''The Shadow of a Doubt'', which also came close to being staged but fell through, was thought to be lost, until it was discovered in 2017. Its world premiere was a radio adaptation broadcast on BBC Radio 3 in 2018.<ref>Drama on 3 ''[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0000xfl The Shadow of a Doubt'']. BBC Radio 3</ref>  She collaborated with [[Marie Tempest]] to write another play, but the two only completed four acts before Marie decided she was no longer interested in costume plays. One of her earliest literary endeavors (1902) was the translation of the play, ''Es Lebe das Leben'' ("The Joy of Living"), by Hermann Sudermann. ''The Joy of Living'' was criticized for its title because the heroine swallows poison at the end, and was a short-lived [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production. It was, however, a successful book.{{sfn|Lewis|1975|p={{pn|date=May 2021}}}}

Many of Wharton's novels are characterized by subtle use of [[dramatic irony]]. Having grown up in upper-class, late-19th-century society, Wharton became one of its most astute critics, in such works as ''[[The House of Mirth]]'' and ''[[The Age of Innocence]]''.

===Themes===
Versions of her mother, Lucretia Jones, often appeared in Wharton's fiction. Biographer [[Hermione Lee]] described it as "one of the most lethal acts of revenge ever taken by a writing daughter."{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}} In her memoir, ''A Backward Glance'', Wharton describes her mother as indolent, spendthrift, censorious, disapproving, superficial, icy, dry and ironic.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=35}}

Wharton's writings often dealt with themes such as "social and individual fulfillment, repressed sexuality, and the manners of old families and the new elite."<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Mulalic|first=Almasa|date=2012|title=Material Details in Edith Wharton's Writings|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/301944958|journal=Epiphany: Journal of Transdisciplinary Studies|volume=5|pages=95–107|via=ResearchGate}}</ref> [[Maureen Howard]], editor of ''Edith Wharton: Collected Stories,  ''notes several recurring themes in Wharton's short stories, including confinement and attempts at freedom, the morality of the author, critiques of intellectual pretension, and the “unmasking” of the truth.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.loa.org/news-and-views/141-remarks-on-edith-whartons-_collected-stories_-by-editor-maureen-howard|title=Remarks on Edith Wharton's Collected Stories by editor Maureen Howard|last=Howard|first=Maureen|date=2001|website=Library of America}}</ref> Wharton's writing also explored themes of “social mores and social reform” as they relate to the “extremes and anxieties of the Gilded Age”.<ref name=":0" /> These themes were expressed in her ghost stories, in which supernatural specters function as richly costumed variations on a theme of all-too-human cruelty.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Supernatural Specters, Normal Human Malice: On Edith Wharton's "Ghosts"|url=https://www.clereviewofbooks.com/home/edith-wharton-ghosts-review|access-date=2021-11-15|website=Cleveland Review of Books|language=en-US}}</ref> 

A key recurring theme in Wharton's writing is the relationship between the house as a physical space and its relationship to its inhabitant's characteristics and emotions. Maureen Howard argues “Edith Wharton conceived of houses, dwelling places, in extended imagery of shelter and dispossession. Houses – their confinement and their theatrical possibilities…they are never mere settings."<ref name=":1" /> 

===Influences===
American children's stories containing slang were forbidden in Wharton's childhood home.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=31}} This included such popular authors as Mark Twain, Bret Harte or "Uncle Remus." She was allowed to read Louisa May Alcott but Wharton preferred Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland'' and Charles Kingsley's ''Water Babies''.{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=31}} Wharton's mother forbade her from reading many novels and Wharton said she "read everything else but novels until the day of my marriage." {{sfn|Lee|2008|p=31}} Instead Wharton read the classics, philosophy, history, and poetry in her father's library including [[Daniel Defoe]], [[John Milton]], [[Thomas Carlyle]], [[Alphonse de Lamartine]], [[Victor Hugo]], [[Jean Racine]], [[Thomas Moore]], [[Lord Byron]], [[William Wordsworth]], [[John Ruskin]], and [[Washington Irving]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|pp=31–34}} Biographer Hermione Lee describes Wharton as having read herself "out of Old New York" and her influences included [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Charles Darwin]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Thomas Henry Huxley|T. H. Huxley]], [[George Romanes]], [[James George Frazer|James Frazer]], and [[Thorstein Veblen]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=23}} These influenced her [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] style of [[novelization]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=23}} Wharton developed a passion for [[Walt Whitman]].{{sfn|Lee|2008|p=32}}
