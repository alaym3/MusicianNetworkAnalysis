==Biography==

===Early years, ''Rubberneck'', and commercial breakthrough (1989–1996)===
Toadies began in 1989 in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].  It recorded a few cassette self-releases and an [[Extended play|E.P.]] titled ''[[Pleather (album)|Pleather]]'' before signing to [[Interscope Records]].  Its first full-length [[album]] ''[[Rubberneck (album)|Rubberneck]]'' was released in the summer of 1994.  Featuring a sound described as "distinctly grunge" and "distinctly Texan",<ref name="DailyCal Rubberneck Reunion"/> ''Rubberneck'' included six [[Single (music)|singles]], "[[Possum Kingdom (song)|Possum Kingdom]]", "Mister Love", "Away", "Tyler", "Backslider" and "I Come From the Water". "Backslider" can be heard in the film ''[[Black Sheep (1996 film)|Black Sheep]]''. "Possum Kingdom" would later become a playable track in the [[Xbox 360]] version of ''[[Guitar Hero II]]''.

Toadies [[Concert tour|toured]] extensively throughout the 1990s supporting ''[[Rubberneck (album)|Rubberneck]]'', opening for artists such as [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], and [[Butthole Surfers|The Butthole Surfers]].  The band also headlined and co-headlined tours with acts such as [[Supersuckers]], and [[Reverend Horton Heat|The Reverend Horton Heat]]. Toadies were a regular act at the festivals Edgefest in [[Dallas]], and [[Buzzfest]] in [[Houston]] during these years.

===''Feeler'' sessions, ''Hell Below/Stars Above'', and breakup (1997–2002)===
The band entered the [[Recording studio|studio]] in 1997 to [[Studio recording|record]] new tracks for a second [[album]], ''[[Feeler (Toadies)|Feeler]]''.<ref name="Feeler (Spin)">{{cite news |last=Goodman |first=William |url=http://www.spin.com/2010/07/exclusive-new-toadies-tune/ |title=EXCLUSIVE: New Toadies Tune |work=Spin.com |date=July 8, 2010 |access-date=December 21, 2015 }}</ref>  [[Interscope Records]] did not approve the finished product, and rejected its 1998 release.<ref name="Feeler (Spin)" /><ref name="Feeler (Avalanche)">{{cite news |last=Sculley |first=Alan |url=http://lubbockonline.com/entertainment/2010-08-20/toadies-fished-out-unreleased-recordings-fresh-%E2%80%98feeler%E2%80%99-release |title=Toadies fished out unreleased recordings for fresh ‘Feeler’ release |work=The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal |date=August 19, 2010 |access-date=December 21, 2015 }}</ref><ref name="Feeler (Statesman)">{{cite news |url=http://www.austin360.com/news/entertainment/music/at-long-last-toadies-feelers-sees-the-light-of-d-1/nRw5Q/ |title=At long last, Toadies' 'Feelers' sees the light of day |work=The Austin American-Statesman |date=August 17, 2010 |access-date=December 21, 2015 }}</ref> In 2000, they went back to the studio, salvaged some of the songs from the ''[[Feeler (Toadies)|Feeler]]'' sessions, and released their second full-length album ''[[Hell Below/Stars Above]]'' in the spring of 2001.<ref name="Feeler (Avalanche)" /><ref name="Feeler (Statesman)" /> Portland-based musician [[Elliott Smith]] performed piano backup for the title track.

''Hell Below/Stars Above'' was not promoted by Interscope, and saw poor sales.<ref name="Observer 2001 Breakup">{{cite news |last=Crain |first=Zac |last2=Wilonsky |first2=Robert |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/dig-a-hole-6391514 |title=Dig a Hole |work=[[Dallas Observer]] |date=August 30, 2001 |access-date=December 21, 2015 }}</ref>  The band toured in the spring and summer of 2001 in support of the new album, until bassist Lisa Umbarger unexpectedly resigned from the band in July 2001.  Umbarger told the Dallas Observer that she resigned after realizing that Interscope Records was not going to promote the band.<ref name="Observer 2001 Breakup" />  Vaden Todd Lewis decided to break up the band rather than continue without her, a decision which "stunned" Umbarger.<ref name="Observer 2001 Breakup" />  The band played a few farewell shows later that summer, with Mark Hughes filling in for Umbarger, before parting ways.<ref name="Observer 2001 Breakup" />

Shortly after the break-up, a [[live album]], ''[[Best of Toadies: Live from Paradise]]'', was released. It was recorded earlier in 2001 at the [[Paradise Rock Club]] in [[Boston|Boston, MA]]. The album was released through [[Interscope Records]], but [[Kirtland Records]] later picked up the band's back catalogue.

===''No Deliverance'', ''Feeler'' release, and ''Play.Rock.Music'' (2006–2013)===
Toadies reformed for a reunion show on March 11, 2006, headlining the Greenville Avenue [[St. Patrick's Day]] parade concert. In March 2007, they embarked on a mini-tour, playing dates in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], [[Houston]], and [[Dallas]]. The final show of the mini-tour was recorded and released as the [[live album]] ''Rock Show''.

The band released its third [[studio album]], ''[[No Deliverance]]'', on August 19, 2008, via [[Kirtland Records]]. The [[lead single]] for the [[album]] was the title track.

In June 2010 it was announced that ''[[Feeler (Toadies)|Feeler]]'', the follow-up album to ''[[Rubberneck (album)|Rubberneck]]'' that was shelved by [[Interscope]], would finally be seeing a release. Vaden Todd Lewis was quoted as saying: "Since there are unfinished versions floating around on the Internet, it is important to us that people hear it as we meant it to be." The band was unable to obtain the original 1997 ''Feeler'' masters from Interscope, and re-recorded the album in 2010.<ref name="Feeler (Spin)" /> The album was released on July 20, 2010.

The band's fifth album, ''[[Play.Rock.Music]]'', was released July 31, 2012 on Kirtland Records.
