==Musical career==

===Beginnings===
Adams first attracted the attention of [[Thomas Whitfield (singer)|Thomas Whitfield]] and Sound of Gospel Records as a lead singer with Houston's Southeast Inspirational Choir affiliated with the [[Church of God in Christ]], under the direction of Carl Preacher, Brenda Waters, and Shirley Joiner. The choir released the single "For My Liberty" in 1982 with her as the featured vocalist. In 1986, Adams was featured on the [[Edwin Hawkins]] Music and Arts Seminar Choir released ''Give Us Peace'', with a performance entitled "My Trust Lies in You". Later, she signed a recording contract with Sound of Gospel which yielded her first album ''Just As I Am'' in 1987.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yolanda Adams |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/artists/adams_yolanda.aspx |access-date=February 20, 2008 |publisher=CBN Music}}</ref> In 1990, she was discovered by producer/keyboardist [[Ben Tankard]], and signed to his independent label [[Tribute Records]] and released ''[[Through the Storm (Yolanda Adams album)|Through The Storm]]''. Tankard's goal with Tribute Records during this time was to develop an audience for a smoother gospel/jazz sound. He featured Adams' vocals on his album and concept video single "You Bring Out The Best in Me" on his 1994 release ''Play Me in Your Key''. The collaboration received positive response from gospel, jazz and "quiet storm" formats.

One year later, Adams followed with ''[[Save the World (Yolanda Adams album)|Save the World]]'', which included her first signature song "The Battle Is The Lord's". Her next release was 1995's ''[[More Than a Melody]]'', which featured more production work from Tankard with contributions from [[O'Landa Draper]], and [[BeBe Winans]]. The single "[[Gotta Have Love]]," from that album featuring [[Tony Terry]] on background vocals, gained mainstream notoriety and was her first single and music video. ''[[Yolanda... Live in Washington]]'', released the following year, featured versions of material from her first three albums. The footage from this recording was released as a collection of two videos on VHS initially, and later as a single set on DVD and CD. During this time Tribute Records' parent company Diadem Music Group merged with Benson Music Group, which was eventually bought by New York-based [[Zomba Group of Companies|Zomba/Verity Records]].

''[[Songs from the Heart (Yolanda Adams album)|Songs from the Heart]]'' was her final release for Verity Records, including "Only Believe", which was a popular song on contemporary radio. The album also included "Still I Rise," a dedication to [[Rosa Parks]], which was inspired by the [[Maya Angelou]] poem of the same name.

===Mainstream breakthrough===
Adams' first significant attention outside the [[urban contemporary gospel]] arena came with the release of ''[[Mountain High... Valley Low]]'' in 1999 on [[Elektra Records]]. Several mainstream artists and producers helped in the production of this album including [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] ([[Janet Jackson]], [[Boyz II Men]]), James "Big Jim" Wright ([[Mariah Carey]], [[Nicole C. Mullen]]), [[Warryn Campbell]] ([[Mary Mary]], [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]]), and Keith Thomas ([[BeBe & CeCe Winans]]). The album went [[Music recording sales certification|2x Platinum]] in 2000 and won Adams a Grammy Award. Notable singles from the album include "[[Yeah (Yolanda Adams Song)|''Yeah'']]", "Fragile Heart", and "[[Open My Heart]]".
"Fragile Heart" was dedicated to the memory of Adams' long-time road manager, who died in 1998.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yolanda Adams: ''Mountain High... Valley Low'' Review |url=http://www.gospelflava.com/reviews/yolandamountain.html |access-date=February 20, 2007 |publisher=GospelFlava.com}}</ref>

In 2000, Adams released a Christmas album, and in 2001 she released a live album (''[[The Experience (Yolanda Adams album)|The Experience]]''). ''[[The Experience (Yolanda Adams album)|The Experience]]'' netted Adams a second [[Grammy Award]] for Best Contemporary Soul Gospel Album. ''[[Believe (Yolanda Adams album)|Believe]]'', which included the hit "[[Never Give Up (Yolanda Adams single)|Never Give Up]]" was released in 2001 and reached gold status according to the RIAA. She would later go on to perform this song at "The Salute to Gospel Music" at the [[White House]] during President [[George W. Bush]]'s administration. In 2001, Adams also released a compilation CD entitled ''The Divas of Gospel''; it included the legendary Grammy Award winner [[Albertina Walker]], who was popularly referred to as the "Queen of Gospel Music" until her death in 2010.

Adams recorded a song for the 2003 film ''[[Honey (2003 film)|Honey]]'' entitled "I Believe", which played during the last scene in the final dance.

Adams was also a judge for the 2nd annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists' careers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Past Judges |url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713024722/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/pastjudges.asp |archive-date=July 13, 2011 |access-date=November 20, 2013 |publisher=Independent Music Awards}}</ref> She is also credited as the Queen of Contemporary Gospel Music.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The album featured the singles "[[Be Blessed]]," "[[Someone Watching Over You]]," "[[This Too Shall Pass (Yolanda Adams Song)|This Too Shall Pass]]", and "[[Victory (Yolanda Adams Song)|Victory]]" (which was prominently featured in the movie ''[[The Gospel (film)|The Gospel]]'').
