==Style==
According to Edwin, "Our style of music definitely goes all over. When we sit down with a drum kit and a guitar, we like to do psychedelic boogie rock. When we're composing songs in the studio or something, rather than our bedrooms, we tend more towards the [[Brian Wilson]] vocal-pop stuff. Psychedelic boogie rock and experimental pop . . . those are the two core loves of ours."<ref name="nn" /> They have described their influences as including "classic rock, delta/piedmont blues, noise, experimental improv, free jazz, blues/boogie rock, [[Drone music|drone]], classical."<ref>Hilmi, Muhammad.

Andy plays a [[Danelectro]] 12-string electric guitar, which, in the context of a two-man band, allows him to "fill the range of low-to-high frequencies well, especially if I can write tunes with  finger-picking figures that have a bass and high end." Previously he has used a  Coral [[electric sitar]].<ref>"[http://genjingrecords.com/archives/6918 Interview: Tonstartssbandht]". Genjing Records.

==Band name==
Tonstartssbandht is a made up word. According to Edwin, it comes from "a word collage that I made cutting up letters and words and I pasted it down and I loved how it looked. Because it's made up, it confused people, people get thrown off by consonants, they take one look at it and sometimes they're disgusted, they're like 'That's not a word anyone could pronounce!'"<ref name="nn" />
