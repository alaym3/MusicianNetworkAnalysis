==Career==
=== Swishahouse (1998–2005) ===
Wall attended [[Jersey Village High School]] and studied [[mass communications]] at the [[University of Houston]] for three years.<ref name="Chron">{{cite news|last=Dansby|first=Andrew|title=Rapper Paul Wall is all smiles lately|url=https://www.chron.com/entertainment/music/article/Rapper-Paul-Wall-is-all-smiles-lately-1670316.php|access-date=January 29, 2021|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|date=May 8, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516181036/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/music/6415191.html|archive-date=May 16, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="AskMen">{{cite web|title=Paul Wall...the people's champ|url=http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_150/191_paul_wall_interview.html|work=AskMen.com|access-date=December 13, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224722/http://www.askmen.com/celebs/interview_150/191_paul_wall_interview.html|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> After proposing to do promotions for Michael "5000" Watts' company [[Swishahouse]], Chamillionaire and Paul Wall came to 97.9 the Box ([[KBXX]]), Watts' radio station.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paulwallworld.com/info/interview2.php |title=Paul Wall World – Interview |publisher=Paulwallworld.com |access-date=2014-02-11}}</ref> Paul and Chamillionaire convinced Watts to let them rap on his radio show and put the verses on one of his mixtapes. That mixtape was titled ''Choppin Em Up Part 2'', which was released in mid-1999. The freestyle became so popular locally that Chamillionaire and Paul Wall became regular staples on Houston's mixtape circuit, appeared on several of Watts' mixtapes and became permanent members of Swishahouse.

After fellow member [[Slim Thug]] left the label, Chamillionaire and Paul Wall followed suit and the two started their own group known as The Color Changin' Click (named after Chamillionaire's [[chameleon]] persona). Each successive mixtape released by The Color Changin' Click led to more business opportunities; the most notable of which was a contract to do a full album for Paid in Full Records. A one-album contract was negotiated between the Color Changin' Click and Paid in Full's label head, DJ Madd Hatta from 97.9 The Box, and the CCC's first album, ''[[Get Ya Mind Correct]]'', would go on to sell over 200,000 copies. Wall's first music exposure came as a street team member on the Northwest side of Houston, promoting southern labels like [[Def Jam Records]], [[Cash Money Records|Cash Money]] and [[No Limit Records]]. He is an accomplished and proficient mixtape and party DJ, known for producing mixtapes in the now well-known [[screwed & chopped]] style, which was invented by [[DJ Screw]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rapindustry.com/paul-wall.htm |title=Paul Wall &#124; New Music Release &#124; Rapindustry.Com Promotion |publisher=Rapindustry.com |access-date=2014-02-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924084728/http://www.rapindustry.com/paul-wall.htm |archive-date=2015-09-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Controversy==
===Chamillionaire===
On November 19, 2004, Wall and his entourage allegedly attacked [[Chamillionaire]]'s younger brother, Rasaq Seriki, at a nightclub. Chamillionaire expressed his disappointment in Paul Wall, arguing that they all used to be family and that these events should not have happened. Before the entire incident between Paul Wall and Rasaq they were all part of the group called "[[The Color Changin' Click]]" which now has become fragmented. Chamillionaire released a diss track with Rasaq titled "Go Head".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6-4fbEgJwY | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701113159/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6-4fbEgJwY| archive-date=2013-07-01 | url-status=dead|title=Chamillionaire - Go Head (Feat. Rasaq) [Paul Wall Diss] |website=YouTube |access-date=September 25, 2012}}</ref>

The dispute ended in 2010, when the pair reunited for a full tour. Wall stated "It took a long time and us growing. You know, we started off as a group and a lot of times when you go your separates ways, a lot of people say, "Oh you can't do it without him" and so you wanna prove them wrong. I know for me, I wanted to prove everyone wrong and prove that I could make it on my own." Chamillionaire replied; "We had been bumping into each other a lot. It's kinda been died down for a little bit now but we just kinda needed that stamp of approval. I think the tour kinda just solidifies it for other people. It's not like today we just stopped beefing, we stop beefing a long time ago, but nobody believed us."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ballerstatus.com/2010/03/24/paul-wall-chamillionaire-discuss-moving-past-beef-jealousy-over-each-others-success/ |title=Paul Wall & Chamillionaire discuss moving past beef; jealousy over each others success |website=BallerStatus.com |access-date=September 25, 2012 |date=2010-03-24}}</ref>
