'''New Medicine''' (formerly '''A Verse Unsung''') is an [[American rock]] band from [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], formed in 2009.

==History==
'''New Medicine''' was originally formed as '''A Verse Unsung''' by two friends, Jake Scherer and Dan Garland, who were attending [[Orono School District|Orono High School]] at the time. The two would write lyrics during classes then work through them musically at Scherer's family's farm in [[Medina, Minnesota|Medina]] where he lived. Kenny Fritze and Aaron Gates were later added to the band and eventually replaced. They signed to [[Photo Finish Records]] after forming the new band with Ryan Guanzon and Matt Brady, calling themselves '''New Medicine'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/pages/New-Medicine/105611636139203?v=desc|title=New Medicine|work=Facebook|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/NewMedicine|title = NEW MEDICINE &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://newmedicine.buzznet.com/user/|title=New Medicine - Buzznet|accessdate=14 November 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318190623/http://newmedicine.buzznet.com/user/|archivedate=18 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=new-medicine-p2223331|pure_url=yes}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Race You to the Bottom]]'', was released September 18, 2010. The band has toured with major recording artists such as [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Halestorm]], [[Buckcherry]], and [[Stone Sour]]. Their songs "Race You to the Bottom," "Laid," and "Rich Kids" have all been added into rotation on Sirius XM Radio's Octane Channel.  "Laid" hit number 32 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart in Spring 2011, "Race You to the Bottom" hit number 19 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart in Spring 2012, and "Rich Kids" hit number 31 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]] chart in Fall 2012, respectively. On December 21, 2012, Matt Brady announced he was leaving the band to spend more time with [[Joy2theWorld]], which helps women and children in Ghana, west Africa. Later the same year, Ryan Guanzon left the band to produce music. Dylan Wood (ex-[[Emphatic (band)|Emphatic]]) took the drums duties since then, and Kyle LeBlanc took over on bass guitar. They released their second album "Breaking the Model" on August 26, 2014 via Imagen Records, with the lead single "One Too Many" hitting number 40 on the [[Mainstream Rock (chart)|Mainstream Rock]]. The band stated on their Facebook page that they have begun work on a new album as of November 28, 2013 and was released on August 25, 2014. Ryan Guanzon returned to the band for just one performance in April 2015 in the band's hometown of Medina, but did so to play guitar as current lead guitarist, Dan Garland, was not able to be there. Matt Brady also made an appearance on-stage that same night as he was in attendance. On April 27, 2015, it was announced that the band would be going on an indefinite [[wiktionary:hiatus|hiatus]].
This hiatus was ended on December 5, 2019 when the band declared via Facebook that they are working on a new album due to their increased following on Spotify. On March 13, 2020 they released their first song of the new album "Die Trying" with the same name. At the end of January 2021, the rock band posted in all social networks the news about the release of a new single together with [[Adelitas Way]].<ref>https://www.instagram.com/p/CKsSV_-ns_3/</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|number=1355686962561212418|user=NewMedicine|title=New song 3/12 collaboration w/ @adelitasway on @Spotify and all platforms. @allihagendorf #NewMeds #AdelitasWay…<!-- full text of tweet that Twitter returned to the bot (excluding links) added by TweetCiteBot.
