'''The Browning''' is an American [[electronicore]] band from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], United States. The Browning’s musical style is characterized by an eclectic blending of [[deathcore]], [[metalcore]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]].

==History==
Formed in early 2005, The Browning was originally a solo project of Jonny Mcbee. Later, the rapper Matt Keck joined the project. 
	
Later on in 2010, Matt Keck left The Browning to be a comedian, and appeared on [[Tosh.0]] in a viewer video titled "I'm a Snake". The two EP's saw a change in style as drummer [[Noah Robertson]], guitarist Brian Cravey, and bassist Jesse Glidewell joined. In late 2011, Brian Cravey was replaced with Collin Woroniak,<ref name="MacBride" /> and they released their video for "Bloodlust". The band's debut album, ''[[Burn This World]]'', was released in October 2011 on [[Earache Records]].<ref name="Smyers">Smyers, Darryl (2011) "[http://blogs.dallasobserver.com/dc9/2011/08/q_a_jonny_mcbee_of_the_brownin.php Q&A: Jonny McBee of The Browning Believes In Aliens, Zombies and The Dallas Metal Scene]", ''[[Dallas Observer]]'' (blog), August 8, 2011.

On November 16, 2012, it was announced that [[Noah Robertson]] and Jesse Glidewell were leaving the band. Drew Ellis switched to bass and Cody Stewart (ex Serpents, ex The Human Condition) was asked to join as their new drummer. Jonny McBee is now the only original member.

On August 2, 2013, the band announced that they would release a new album entitled ''[[Hypernova (album)|Hypernova]]'' through Earache Records as well as releasing a new song from that record entitled "Gravedigger".

On January 27, 2015, it was released to the public that Alex Maggard would be the 5th member of the band, making the lineup its largest since 2012. The first tour he appeared on  was "The Confessions Tour" featuring Alesana, Capture The Crown, Conquer Divide, and The Funeral Portrait.

On July 26, 2015, Collin Woroniak announced via Facebook that he would be leaving The Browning for unknown reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/GlobalMetalApocalypse/photos/a.802108049832204.1073741833.391504117559268/946610998715241/?type=1&theater|title=Mobile Uploads - Global Metal Apocalypse - Facebook|work=facebook.com}}</ref> Woroniak returned in the summer of 2018, first as a fill-in and later full time, as the bassist/vocalist. 

On June 24, 2016, the band released their 3rd full-length, ''[[Isolation (The Browning Album)|Isolation]]''.

On August 16, 2018, the band released the song "Carnage" (featuring Jake Hill). Besides eleven other tracks, this song would be part of their fourth album ''[[Geist (The Browning album)|Geist]]''. The new album was released on October 26, 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/the-browning-to-release-geist-album-in-october/|title=THE BROWNING to Release 'Geist' Album in October|date=17 August 2018}}</ref>

==Musical style==
While originally a rap/metal project, The Browning now plays what can be described as a combination of extreme metal with strong electronic characteristics.<ref name="Springorum">Springorum, Bjorn (2011) "The Browning", ''[[Metal Hammer]]'' (German edition), December 2011</ref><ref name="MacBride">MacBride, Lee (2011) "The Browning: Fire Starters", ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'', December 2011</ref> Their electronic side incorporates [[hardstyle]], [[trance music|trance]], [[electronica]], and [[dubstep]],<ref name="Garwood" /> while their metal side incorporates [[metalcore]], [[deathcore]] elements.<ref name="MacBride" /><ref name="Owen">Owen, Rachel (2011) "The Browning ''Burn This World''", ''[[Big Cheese (magazine)|Big Cheese]]'', November 2011</ref><ref name="Garwood">Garwood, Russell (2011) "Noah Robertson On the Rack", ''[[Zero Tolerance (magazine)|Zero Tolerance]]'', November 2011, pp. 94-95</ref> Their signature style is a hybrid of double-bass drumming, [[Roland TR-808|808]]'s, and chugging; creating a solid, pounding rhythm layered with electronics. Their lyrics focus on many different topics, such as sci-fi themed songs with aliens, zombies, vampires, Pokémon or songs with positive messages.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://earachenews.blogspot.com/2011/09/browning-discuss-bands-name-musical.html|title=EARACHE NEWS: THE BROWNING DISCUSS BAND'S NAME, MUSICAL DIRECTION AND MORE IN NEW INTERVIEW|author=Digby|work=earachenews.blogspot.com|date=30 September 2011}}</ref>
