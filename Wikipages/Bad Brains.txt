Their classic lineup includes singer [[H.R.]], guitarist [[Dr. Know (guitarist)|Dr. Know]], bassist [[Darryl Jenifer]], and drummer [[Earl Hudson]]. This lineup was intact until 1987 and has reunited periodically in the years since.

==History==

=== Formation and early years ===
The band's origins date to 1976, when the members first came together as a [[jazz fusion]] band called '''Mind Power''',<ref name="Barry" /> in the mold of bands such as [[Return to Forever]] and [[Mahavishnu Orchestra]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=2020-09-13|title=Original BAD BRAINS Singer SID MCCRAY Dies|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/original-bad-brains-singer-sid-mccray-dies/|access-date=2021-05-31|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref> The group included lead guitarist [[Dr. Know (guitarist)|Dr. Know]] (Gary Miller), bassist [[Darryl Jenifer]], and brothers Paul Hudson (later known as [[H.R.]]) on rhythm guitar and [[Earl Hudson]] on drums.

In 1977, the band's friend Sid McCray introduced them to [[punk rock]].<ref name=":0" /> Mind Power decided to switch their sound to [[hardcore punk]] and changed their name to '''Bad Brains''',<ref name="Barry" /> after the [[Ramones]] song "Bad Brain."<ref name="Barry" /> Despite their burgeoning punk sound, after seeing [[Bob Marley]] in concert the band also became interested in [[reggae]] music and the [[Rastafari movement]].<ref name="Moskowitz_06" /> McCray was briefly the singer for the new hardcore punk incarnation of the band, but he soon departed, and H.R. switched from guitar to lead vocals.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Andersen |first1=Mark |last2=Jenkins |first2=Mark |title=Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CU1jKq0TlvQC&q=%22dance+of+days%22+sid+mcray+h.r.&pg=PA34 |date=January 2003 |publisher=[[Akashic Books]] |isbn=978-1-888451-44-3 |page=34 |access-date=March 7, 2012}}</ref>

The band gained a fan base in Washington D.C. due to their high-energy performances and occasional reggae songs.<ref name="Moskowitz_06">{{cite book |last=Moskowitz |first=David V. |title=Caribbean Popular Music |year=2006 |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |isbn=0-313-33158-8 |pages=18–19}}</ref> In 1979 they were blacklisted from many Washington area clubs due to their destructive fans;<ref>{{Cite web|last=https://www.washingtontimes.com|first=The Washington Times|title=Bad Brains, D.C. punk band, make Rock and Roll Hall of Fame shortlist|url=https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/18/bad-brains-dc-punk-act-make-rock-and-roll-hall-fam/|access-date=2021-05-31|website=The Washington Times|language=en-US}}</ref> this was later addressed in their song "Banned in D.C.".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bad Brains No Longer Banned in DC, Set to Play Night of U.S. Election {{!}} Exclaim!|url=https://exclaim.ca/music/article/bad_brains_no_longer_banned_in_dc_set_to_play_night_of_us|access-date=2021-05-31|website=exclaim.ca|language=en-ca}}</ref> By 1980 the band relocated to New York City, where they would serve as a catalyst for that city's burgeoning hardcore scene.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|title=The world is fast.

===Stylistic expansion and line-up changes (1986–1994)===
In 1986, Bad Brains signed with [[SST Records]] and released ''[[I Against I]]''. In addition to the band's hardcore punk and reggae sounds, this album added elements from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] and [[funk]].<ref name=":1">{{Citation|title=I Against I - Bad Brains {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/i-against-i-mw0000189123|language=en|access-date=2021-05-31}}</ref> H.R. provided the vocals for the song "Sacred Love" over the phone from the [[Lorton Reformatory]] while serving time for a cannabis charge.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-07-29|title='Sacred Love': The Bad Brains song that was recorded over the phone from prison|url=https://dangerousminds.net/comments/sacred_love_the_bad_brains_song_that_was_recorded_over_the_phone_from_priso|access-date=2021-05-31|website=DangerousMinds}}</ref> H.R. gained additional critical notice for his expanded vocal style on ''I Against I''; according to Rick Anderson of [[AllMusic]], "[HR] digs deep into his bag of voices and pulls them all out, one by one: the frightening nasal [[falsetto]] that was his signature in the band's hardcore days, an almost [[bel canto]] [[baritone]], and a declamatory speed-rap chatter that spews lyrics with the mechanical precision of a machine gun".<ref name=":1" /> [[File:Chuck_Mosley.jpg|thumb|right|201x201px|Chuck Mosley fronted Bad Brains from 1990 to 1991.]]
H.R. and Earl Hudson quit the band in 1987 to focus on reggae music. Touring for ''I Against I'' was completed with singer Taj Singleton and former [[Cro-Mags]] drummer Mackie Jayson.<ref name="Erlewine" /> In 1988, Bad Brains signed with [[Caroline Records]] and began recording the album ''[[Quickness]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=Quickness - Bad Brains {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/quickness-mw0000205406|language=en|access-date=2021-05-31}}</ref> The album was recorded with Singleton and Jayson, but the Hudson brothers returned to the band in 1989 and H.R. replaced Singleton's work with new lyrics and vocals.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bad Brains|url=https://www.riptidemusic.com/bad-brains|access-date=2021-05-31|website=Riptide Music Group|language=en}}</ref>

During this period, the Hudson brothers, who wanted to steer the band toward reggae, often clashed with Dr. Know and Jenifer, who were increasingly interested in hard rock and heavy metal.<ref name="Erlewine" /> H.R. often failed to turn up for scheduled concerts and recording sessions. After the tour supporting ''Quickness'' ended in 1989, the Hudson brothers again quit the band. Mackie Jayson again joined on drums. Former [[Faith No More]] member [[Chuck Mosley]] took over on lead vocals in 1990-91,<ref name="rollingstone.com">{{Cite web|last1=Weingarten|first1=Christopher R.|date=2017-11-11|title=Chuck Mosley, Former Faith No More Singer, Dead at 57|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/chuck-mosley-former-faith-no-more-singer-dead-at-57-197538/|access-date=2021-05-31|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> and was then replaced by Israel Joseph I (Dexter Pinto).<ref name="Erlewine" /> In 1990 the band collaborated with [[Henry Rollins]] on a cover of [[The MC5]]'s "[[Kick Out the Jams (song)|Kick Out the Jams]]", which appears on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Pump Up the Volume (film)|Pump Up the Volume]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=100 Greatest Soundtracks of All Time: 'Pump Up the Volume' (1990)|url=https://www.albumism.com/lists1/100-greatest-soundtracks-of-all-time-pump-up-the-volume|access-date=2021-05-31|website=Albumism|language=en-US}}</ref>

As bands influenced by Bad Brains (such as [[Living Colour]] and [[Fishbone]]) enjoyed commercial success, [[Epic Records]] approached Dr. Know in 1992 and offered the band their first major-label record deal.<ref>{{Cite web|last=June 2020|first=Greg Prato09|title=Punk, purity, and positive mental attitude: The turbulent tale of Bad Brains|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/punk-purity-and-positive-mental-attitude-the-turbulent-tale-of-bad-brains|access-date=2021-05-31|website=Classic Rock Magazine|language=en}}</ref> The album ''[[Rise (Bad Brains album)|Rise]]'' was released by Epic in 1993.<ref>{{Citation|title=Rise - Bad Brains {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/rise-mw0000619889|language=en|access-date=2021-05-31}}</ref> Jayson left the band in the middle of the ensuing tour and was temporarily replaced by [[Chuck Treece]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2020-05-18|title=Chuck Treece - Wheels of Soul|url=https://www.dosagemagazine.com/wheels-of-soul-catching-up-with-philadelphia-punk-rock-and-skateboard-icon-chuck-treece/|access-date=2021-05-31|website=dosage MAGAZINE|language=en}}</ref>

===Original line-up reunions and name change (1994–2004)===
The Hudson brothers again returned to the band in 1994,<ref name="Barry" /> and they signed with [[Maverick (company)|Maverick Records]] for the 1995 album ''[[God of Love (album)|God of Love]]''.<ref>{{Citation|title=God of Love - Bad Brains {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/god-of-love-mw0000171934|language=en|access-date=2021-05-31}}</ref> In support of the album, Bad Brains opened for the [[Beastie Boys]] on the ''[[Ill Communication]]'' tour, and headlined a U.S. tour with the then-unknown [[Deftones]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deftonesworld.com/tourarchive.htm |title=Tour Dates Archive |work=deftonesworld.com |access-date=September 19, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beastiemania.com/whois/bad_brains/ |title=Who Is Who – Bad Brains |first=Raul |last=Pollicino |work=Beastiemania.com |access-date=September 19, 2016}}</ref> However, the reunion did not last for long, because of H.R.'s erratic behavior while performing and several violent incidents against the band's manager, fans, and venue employees. H.R. landed in jail and the band broke up once again.<ref>{{Cite web|author=MTV News Staff|title=Bad Brains' H. R.

In 1997 Bad Brains reconvened to remaster some early recordings, which were released as the EP ''[[The Omega Sessions]].''<ref>{{Citation|title=Omega Sessions - Bad Brains {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/mw0000030317|language=en|access-date=2021-05-31}}</ref> From 1998 to 2001, the original lineup toured under the name '''Soul Brains''' and released two live albums.<ref>{{Cite web|author=MTV News Staff|title=H.R.
