==History==

===''Illegimitation'' (2002–2003)===
Obscura was formed in late 2002 by [[Steffen Kummerer]] on guitar and backing vocals, Jonas Baumgartl on drums and cello, Armin Seitz playing guitar and vocalist / bassist Martin Ketzer with the name Illegimitation. Performing local shows, the band booked their own concept tour in [[Bavaria]] called "Blasting Bavaria Tour" in 2003, followed by editions in 2004, 2005 and 2007. The band recorded their first and only self titled demo in November 2003 with producer V.Santura ([[Triptykon]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Dark Fortress]]). The demo contained four songs, received positive feedback within southern Germany and took root in underground circles. In early 2004 both Martin Ketzer and Armin Seitz left the band. On second guitar Stephan Bergbauer joined to record their debut album in Summer 2004.

===''Retribution'' (2004–2007)===
The band entered Mastersound Studios in Fellbach, Germany with producer [[Alexander Krull]] of [[Atrocity (band)|Atrocity]], [[Leaves Eyes]] who pushed the band within a three-week lasting recording session. During the recordings the band was renamed after the [[Gorguts]] album ''[[Obscura (album)|Obscura]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=260055 |title=Obscura |last=Burton |first=Brent |publisher=[[Decibel magazine]] |access-date=2009-01-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505193653/http://decibelmagazine.com/Content.aspx?ncid=260055 |archive-date=May 5, 2009 }}</ref> Finished in August 2004, Obscura self-released ''[[Retribution (Obscura album)|Retribution]]'' on 7 July 2005 and immediately started to work on a follow up release the same year. This is in debate because Raffo Torres from Jayuya, PR says that the self-released album was done in 2004 and not 2005. With the addition of Markus Lempsch on guitar and Jonas Fischer on bass the band re-released Retribution on their own label and toured alongside [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]] within Europe in 2006. Performing at [[Brutal Assault]] Festival in Czech Republic, Mountains of Death Festival in Switzerland and Up From the Ground Festival in Germany, Obscura gained their fanbase and established a proper following in central Europe. In 2007 Obscura hot several festivals in Europe, followed by their first headlining tour in Southern and Eastern Europe with [[Agony (band)|Agonize]]. The tour started in Athens, Greece and contained 22 shows in Croatia, Serbia, Bosnia, Macedonia, Hungary, Slovakia, Germany and France. While Markus Lempsch and Jonas Baumgartl left the band in early 2007, Obscura performed as a three piece with session drummer Matthias Landes of [[Dark Fortress]] and [[Noneuclid]]. Johannes Rennig ([[Profanity]]) entered Obscura on guitar in October 2007. In November 2007, drummer [[Hannes Grossmann]] (ex-[[Necrophagist]]) and fretless bassist [[Jeroen Paul Thesseling]] (ex-[[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]]) were recruited as new permanent members, followed by guitarist [[Christian Muenzner]] (ex-[[Necrophagist]]) in February 2008 to replace Johannes Rennig.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=88998|title=Obscura Joined By Former Necrophagist Guitarist|date=2008-01-22|publisher=[[Blabbermouth|blabbermouth.com]]|access-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505163508/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=88998|archive-date=2009-05-05}}</ref>

===''Cosmogenesis'' (2008–2010)===

In September 2008 Obscura signed with [[Relapse Records]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=104645|title=Obscura Signs with Relapse Records|date=2008-09-12|publisher=[[Blabbermouth|blabbermouth.com]]|access-date=2009-01-26|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090505163448/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=104645|archive-date=2009-05-05}}</ref> and released its second full-length album ''[[Cosmogenesis (album)|Cosmogenesis]]'' in early 2009. The album sold around 900 copies in the US in its first week and debuted at number 71 on the Top New Artist Albums chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/obscura-cosmogenesis-first-week-u-s-sales-revealed/ |title=Obscura: 'Cosmogenesis' First Week U.S. Sales Revealed |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2009-02-25 |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref> The band started their first-ever North American tour as part of the Cosmogenesis Worldtour in April 2009 alongside [[Cannibal Corpse]]. Within one year the band played more than 160 shows all over the world as support for [[Atheist (band)|Atheist]], [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|the Black Dahlia Murder]] and Cannibal Corpse. Their first headliner tour was in the USA. Obscura toured Japan as support for [[Nile (band)|Nile]] and [[Triptykon]] in 2010. On February 16, 2010, Obscura reissued their debut album ''[[Retribution (Obscura album)|Retribution]]'', remastered and repackaged with three bonus tracks. Obscura's official guitar tablature book for ''Cosmogenesis'' was released on January 5. ''Cosmogenesis'' was listed by Metal Storm as one of the 100 most important death metal albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/bands/albums_top.php?album_style=Death |title=Top 100 Death metal albums |publisher=Metal Storm |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref>

Obscura released ''Omnivium'' on March 29, 2011. The record was written over a period of two years, with members writing songs and sending them to each other over the internet. On a lyrical basis the album dealt with religion and the evolution of humankind, with Kummerer taking significant influence from Friedrich Schelling's “On Nature's Connection to the Spirit World”<ref name="metalunderground.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalunderground.com/interviews/details.cfm?newsid=66151 |title=Obscura Front Man Talks "Omnivium" - in Interviews |publisher=Metal Underground.com |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref> The album earned positive feedback around the world and entered US and German charts, selling 2,000 within the first week of release in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/obscura-omnivium-first-week-sales-revealed/ |title=Obscura: 'Omnivium' First Week Sales Revealed |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=2011-04-06 |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref> It debuted at number 11 on the USA's [[Top Heatseekers]] chart,<ref>[http://www.bravewords.com/news/159873 Obscura's Omnivium Debuts On Billboard Heatseekers Chart] bravewords.com. 2011-04-11.

The artwork for the album follows a specific color scheme as part of a four-album concept sequence. Orion Landau, who also published the artwork for the last two albums, was responsible for developing Kummerer's ideas for the cover art.<ref name="metalunderground.com"/>

Thesseling left the band due to scheduling conflicts between Obscura and Pestilence. Later, Thesseling cited economic reasons as being the motive for rejoining Pestilence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Kevin |url=http://www.notreble.com/buzz/2011/11/17/ultra-low-an-interview-with-jeroen-paul-thesseling/ |title=Ultra Low: An Interview with Jeroen Paul Thesseling |publisher=Notreble.com |date=2011-11-17 |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref>

Thesseling was replaced with [[Linus Klausenitzer]] of the progressive death metal band Noneuclid, the band making the announcement in September 2011. Obscura started the 164 concert-long Omnivium Worldtour in their home town of [[Landshut]], Germany, followed by a full European tour alongside [[Hate Eternal]], [[Beneath the Massacre]] and [[Defiled]]. They also played a five-week tour supporting [[Children of Bodom]] and [[Devin Townsend]] within North America. On the August 10 the band announced their first southeast Asian headlining tour, performing in Thailand, Indonesia, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates. In November and December the same year a North American headlining tour followed, supported by [[Abysmal Dawn]] and [[Last Chance to Reason]]. In March–April 2012 the band headlined a European run with support by [[Spawn of Possession]], [[Gorod (band)|Gorod]] and [[Exivious]]. To promote ''Omnivium'', the band played a first headlining tour in Japan alongside Beneath the Massacre and Defiled in June 2012. In 2013 Obscura embarked on a European Tour alongside [[Death (metal band)|Death]], with most of the shows sold out.

[[File:Obscura, Christian Muenzner at Party.San Metal Open Air 2013 02.jpg|thumb|right|Guitarist [[Christian Münzner]] left [[Necrophagist]] in 2006 before joining Obscura]]
In late 2011 Obscura started an online [[crowdfunding]] scheme to pay for the release of a combination of their first demo, demos from the ''Cosmogenesis'' sessions and three cover songs from the bands Death, Atheist and Cynic. Within 60 days the band generated $14,600 in fan donations, almost five times their financial target.

In celebration of their tenth year as a band, the band played a special anniversary show on the December 15, 2012, in Landshut, Germany, with support from [[Dark Fortress]] and [[Hokum]]. The show featured a reunion of the early members who recorded the first demo, ''Illegimitation''. This show also marked the end of the Omnivium Worldtour. In March 2013, Obscura embarked on a European Tour supported by [[Aeon (band)|Aeon]], Deadborn and Over Your Threshold.

===''Akróasis'' (2014–2017)===
In 2014, guitarist [[Christian Münzner]] left the band due to creative differences and his inability to tour as a result of his [[focal dystonia]] muscle spasms.<ref name="metalsucks1">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2014/07/11/guitarist-christian-muenzner-drummer-hannes-grossmann-quit-obscura/ |title=Guitarist Christian Muenzner and Drummer Hannes Grossmann Quit Obscura |publisher=MetalSucks |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref> Additionally, [[Hannes Grossmann]] left at the same time, citing his own interests in forming a separate band.<ref name="metalsucks1"/> Obscura then hired guitarist Tom Geldschläger and fusion drummer Sebastian Lanser of German jazz metal group [[Panzerballett]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.realmofobscura.com/ |title=Obscura &#124; The Official Website |publisher=Realmofobscura.com |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref> 
Obscura was scheduled to tour the US with the new line up as a part of the 2015 Summer Slaughter Tour, but despite early applications for visas they were unable to perform. Prior to releasing the band's fourth record ''[[Akroasis]]'' Obscura announced Munich Guitar Institute graduate Rafael Trujillo as their new permanent lead guitarist, replacing Geldschläger who was released from his duties by Kummerer as of July 2015.

==Musical styles and lyrical themes==
Obscura are known for playing technically and compositionally complex music, with several band members having studied music theory.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musictheoryforguitar.com/musictheoryinterviewchristianmuenzner.html|title=Music Theory Interview With Christian Muenzner|last=Zillio|first=Tommaso|website=www.musictheoryforguitar.com|access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progressivemusicplanet.com/2016/02/01/interview-with-steffen-kummerer-of-obscura/|title=Interview with Steffen Kummerer of Obscura|last=progmanrob|date=2016-02-01|website=Progressive Music Planet|access-date=2016-08-28}}</ref>

Founding member Kummerer devises the band's lyricism and imagery himself. Obscura's lyrics focus mainly on the writings of famous German philosophers. The band's second release, ''Cosmogenesis'', presented their interest in philosophy, which Kummerer describes as being influenced by the works of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/Obscura-Interview.htm|title=Obscura Interview|publisher=Heavymetal.about.com|access-date=2015-11-16|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105063047/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/interviews/a/Obscura-Interview.htm|archive-date=2013-11-05}}</ref> and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], with ''Omnivium'' showing a shift in interests, and being based solely on the work of German philosopher [[Friedrich Schelling]].<ref name="blowthescene.com">{{cite web|url=http://blowthescene.com/interviews/obscura-interview.html |title=Obscura Interview |publisher=Blow The Scene |date=2011-03-18 |access-date=2015-11-16}}</ref>

In describing these lyrics, Kummerer states:
<blockquote>''Cosmogenesis'' started with the beginning of our existence, the big bang theory if you want to say so, and deals with different layers and synonyms on a philosophical basis. The second, ''Omnivium'', takes part of the evolution in many different layers such as the basic ape to human thought, religious topics, how the human individuals evolve within their existence and uses as its basic theme the novel ''On Nature's Connection to the Spirit World'' by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Friedrich Schelling]]''.</blockquote>
