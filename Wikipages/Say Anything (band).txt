'''Say Anything''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The band was formed in 2000 by [[Max Bemis]] and his friends, and within two years, they self-released two EPs and a full-length album.

In 2003, the band signed with their first label, [[Doghouse Records]]. A year later, they released ''[[...Is a Real Boy]]''. To support the album, they picked up new members and began touring; however, despite rapidly growing critical and fan acclaim, Bemis' health problems, including [[bipolar disorder]] and drug addictions, sidelined the band in 2005 as five band members left during the year.

Say Anything signed with [[J Records]] in 2005 and, following Bemis' successful rehabilitation, re-released ''...Is a Real Boy'' on J Records. They went on co-headlining tours with [[Saves the Day]] in 2006 and [[Hellogoodbye]] in 2007. In 2008, Say Anything went on a headlining tour across the US and UK and appeared on every date of [[Warped Tour]].

The band announced its retirement in 2018, months before the 2019 release of their eighth LP, ''Oliver Appropriate''.

==History==

===Early years (2000–2004)===
The band was formed in 2000 by [[Max Bemis]] and four of his friends as Sayanything. Within two years, they self-released two EPs, ''[[Junior Varsity (Say Anything album)|Junior Varsity]]'' and ''[[In Your Dreams (Say Anything album)|In Your Dreams]]'', and the full-length ''[[Baseball (album)|Baseball: An Album by Sayanything]]''.

In 2002, Sayanything added a space to their name to become Say Anything. In late 2002, Bemis and Linder recorded the ''[[Menorah/Majora]]'' EP and released the album online.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bemis|first=Max|url=http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/ |title=Archive.org: SayAnythingMusic.com|date=2003-02-05|access-date=2008-08-02|publisher=Say Anything |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030205052056/http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/ |archive-date = 2003-02-05}}</ref> By this point, Say Anything's releases had generated "a major bidding war". [[Drive-Thru Records]] pursued the band and called Max Bemis "the next [[Bob Dylan]]."<ref name=AP_LTT_164>{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Trevor|title=Live Through This|journal=Alternative Press|issue=233|date=December 2007|pages=164}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Staddon|first=Tristan|title=Mad Max|journal=Alternative Press|issue=212|date=March 2006|pages=58}}</ref> [[Brett Gurewitz]] of [[Epitaph Records]] recorded "A Boston Peace," one of the [[Say Anything discography#Dormroom Demos|dorm-room demos]], with the band. In early 2003, Say Anything signed with [[Doghouse Records]] stating sarcastically that Doghouse "put out such obscure, borderline [[Do it yourself|D.I.Y.]] records as ''[[The All-American Rejects (album)|The All-American Rejects]]''."<ref name=TabWorldBio>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetabworld.com/Say_Anything_biography.html|title=Say Anything biography|work=The Tab World|access-date=2008-07-21}}</ref><ref name=SayAnythingBio>{{cite web|last=Bemis |first=Max |url=http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/biography |title=Say Anything biography – by Max Bemis |work=The Official Say Anything Site |access-date=2008-08-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526042057/http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/biography |archive-date=2008-05-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

After signing with the label, Bemis began writing songs for his band's Doghouse debut.  Bemis went into the studio with Florida producer [[Paul Trust]].  They recorded 3 songs that were not released although one of the songs entitled  "Spider Song" would later appear on a Doghouse compilation.  With tremendous self-created pressure, he threw himself into pushing the sonic boundaries of the band and maturing their sound, incorporating elements of math-rock, indie-pop and theatrical pomp. He and Linder also started the search for a producer. The two met several producers but eventually decided on Tim O'Heir and [[Stephen Trask]]. Bemis struggled with different ideas for the record and decided the album should focus on "the artistic struggle, the fact that every creative person has this sick ambition to affect some sort of change in society with their art, to be more than just a guy in a band or a poet or a sculptor." Bemis originally intended the album to be a [[rock opera]] with a full script, narration, and a cast of characters. It was tentatively titled ''Zona! Zona!'' However, Bemis became overwhelmed by the entire process of writing and playing most of the instruments and had a breakdown.<ref name=SayAnythingBio/><ref name=Archive20030424>{{cite web|last=Bemis|first=Max|url=http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/ |title=Archive.org: SayAnythingMusic.com|date=2003-04-24|access-date=2008-08-02|publisher=Say Anything |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20030424062429/http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/ |archive-date = 2003-04-24}}</ref>

"I literally lost my mind while we were recording," stated Bemis regarding the breakdown. The breakdown was precipitated by a [[mockumentary]] discussed by Bemis and O'Heir. Bemis' condition led him to believe he was being secretly filmed for the mockumentary; the situation culminated in him walking the streets of Brooklyn thinking he was being filmed while encountering friends (who were actually strangers).<ref name=CrazyDays>{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Trevor|title=Crazy Days|journal=Alternative Press|issue=194|date=September 2004|pages=104}}</ref> After recovering, Bemis decided to focus solely on the music and dropped the idea of a script.<ref name=SayAnythingBio/> Around July 2003, the band began recording ''[[...Is a Real Boy]]'', their first album with Doghouse Records. Bemis said the two people he wanted to "outdo with ''...Is a Real Boy'' were [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Jesus]]."<ref name=CrazyDays/> In addition to working with O'Heir and Trask, Say Anything worked with [[Forrest Kline]] (of power pop band [[Hellogoodbye]]) to record the ''[[For Sale...]]'' EP, released in 2004.<ref name=ForSale>{{cite AV media notes|others=Say Anything|title=For Sale...|publisher=Doghouse Records|year=2004}}</ref> The band also worked with ECA Records to record a promotional album that was never released.<ref name=Archive20030424/>

''...Is a Real Boy'' was released August 3, 2004.<ref name=DR_IARB>{{cite web|url=http://www.doghouserecords.com/v11/link_releasesDetail.php?detailID=7&bandID=Say%20Anything |title=Doghouse Records page on ''...Is a Real Boy'' |access-date=2008-08-02 |publisher=Doghouse Records |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210081630/http://www.doghouserecords.com/v11/link_releasesDetail.php?detailID=7&bandID=Say%20Anything |archive-date=December 10, 2008 }}</ref> The album featured Linder on drums and Bemis on vocals, guitar, bass guitar, and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]].<ref name=IARB>{{cite AV media notes|others=Say Anything|title=...Is a Real Boy|publisher=Doghouse Records|year=2004}}</ref> ''...Is a Real Boy'' received positive reviews, including a 99% from [[AbsolutePunk.net]] and four and a half stars (out of five) from [[Allmusic]].<ref name=APnetIARBreview>{{cite web|last=Tate|first=Jason|url=http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=97070|title=Say Anything – ''...Is a Real Boy'' – Album Review|date=2005-11-20|access-date=2008-08-02|publisher=AbsolutePunk.net}}</ref><ref name=allmusicIARBreview>{{cite web|last=Apar|first=Corey|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r701019|pure_url=yes}}|title=allmusic ((( ''...Is a Real Boy'' > Overview )))|access-date=2008-08-02|publisher=allmusic}}</ref> When the band began touring in support of ''...Is a Real Boy'', they picked up Dan DeLauro, Casper Adams, and Kevin Seaton.<ref name=TabWorldBio/>

Say Anything signed with [[J Records]] in 2005, owned by [[Sony BMG Music Entertainment]], one of the [[List of record labels|"big four" record labels]]. When asked why he signed with a major label, Bemis stated, "We were looking to expand our fan base as well as have more money to tour comfortably. I also wanted enough money to work with an awesome producer for [''[[In Defense of the Genre]]'']."<ref name=APnetBemisInterview>{{cite web|last=Tate|first=Jason|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=246310|title=Interview with Max Bemis|date=2007-06-19|work=AbsolutePunk.com|access-date=2008-08-02}}</ref> In June 2005, Say Anything was forced to cancel a six-week headlining tour with [[Circa Survive]] and [[Emanuel (band)|Emanuel]] on the third day of the tour due to health problems with Bemis, including "full-on paranoid delusions" in [[Austin, Texas]].<ref name=Nuts>{{cite web|url=http://www.aversion.com/news/news_article.cfm?news_id=4647|title=Say Anything Guy Goes Nuts|date=2005-07-13|access-date=2008-08-02|publisher=Aversion}}</ref><ref name=AP_LTT_166>{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Trevor|title=Live Through This|journal=Alternative Press|issue=233|date=December 2007|pages=166}}</ref>  At this point, Bemis' bipolar disorder and drug addictions were wreaking havoc on the band.  Bassists DeLauro and Seaton had already parted ways with the band.  Andy Jackson left in September after only a few months of touring with Say Anything.  Casper Adams, who was clashing personally with Bemis despite a close friendship, was fired after a show.<ref name=AP_LTT_168>{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Trevor|title=Live Through This|journal=Alternative Press|issue=233|date=December 2007|pages=168}}</ref>

On October 3, 2005, Bemis had another breakdown; this time, it involved depressive behaviour, spitting in food at an outdoor cafe, spending a "half-hour pouring a bowl of soup onto the floor, one spoonful at a time," engaging in a street fight and finally being admitted to a mental hospital by an off-duty policeman. This incident forced Say Anything to cancel another tour, this time with Bemis' personal idols [[Saves the Day]], along with [[Senses Fail]] and [[The Early November]]. The band was replaced by Emanuel. After returning from his stay in the hospital, Bemis' mother and the remaining members of the band selected the [[Menninger Foundation|Menninger clinic]] in [[Houston, Texas]], to rehab Bemis. Eventually, Bemis approved of their decision, admitted himself to the Menninger clinic, and has reportedly not had a relapse since.<ref name=TabWorldBio/><ref name=AP_LTT_164167168>{{cite journal|last=Kelley|first=Trevor|title=Live Through This|journal=Alternative Press|issue=233|date=December 2007|pages=164, 167–168}}</ref>

===''...Is a Real Boy'' (2005–2007)===
Under [[J Records]], Say Anything re-released ''[[...Is a Real Boy]]'' with a bonus CD entitled ''[[...Was a Real Boy]]'' on February 28, 2006 (although the album was originally slated for release on October 18, 2005 and later January 17, 2006).<ref name=Nuts/> However, copies were leaked before the release by [[Tower Records]] and [[His Master's Voice]], with some copies selling on [[eBay]] at inflated prices. According to the album's liner notes, ''...Was a Real Boy'' was originally intended as charity record and recorded in Kevin Seaton's garage. Bemis said that "it was J Records' idea to reissue ''...Is a Real Boy''. They believe it has a mainstream appeal that wasn't really reached when Doghouse released the record."<ref name=Mammoth>{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Steve|url=http://mammothpress.com/index.php?area=readinterview&pid=102|title=Mammoth press interviews Max Bemis|date=2006-05-04|access-date=2008-08-15|publisher=Mammoth Press}}</ref> Around this time, the band also released "[[Alive with the Glory of Love]]" as a single.<ref name=TabWorldBio/>

Alex Kent joined the band to play bass guitar after the band met him while touring with Lance's Hero. [[Jake Turner (musician)|Jake]] and Jeff Turner joined to play guitar and help with backup vocals after Adams and Jackson left. Parker Case completed the sextet when he joined to play guitar and [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] after his previous band [[JamisonParker]] broke up. At the time, JamisonParker and Say Anything shared the same manager, Randy Nichols; the band met Case while at a train station on the way to Nichols' wedding.<ref name=SayAnythingBio/><ref name=APnetBemisInterview/><ref name=DrivenFarOff>{{cite web|last=Metzger|first=Chloe|url=http://www.drivenfaroff.com/2008/04/23/say-anything-interview-april-16th-2008/|title=Interview with Say Anything|work=Driven Far Off |date=2008-04-23|access-date=2008-08-15}}</ref><ref name=Pollstar>{{cite web|url=http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=SAYANY|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226151732/http://www.pollstar.com/news/viewhotstar.pl?Artist=SAYANY|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-02-26|title=HotStar Say Anything|last=Speer|first=Deborah|work=PollStar|access-date=2008-08-15}}</ref>

In summer 2006, Say Anything toured with [[Dashboard Confessional]]; [[Ben Lee]] was with the tour in the US, while [[John Ralston (musician)|John Ralston]] joined the tour in Canada. The band was asked to be a part of the [[Warped Tour 2006]], but instead opted for the Dashboard tour. Bemis later made statements implying he did not feel he was emotionally ready for a Warped Tour.<ref name=Warped2K8_136>{{cite journal|last=Pettigrew|first=Jason|title=Warped 2K8|journal=Alternative Press|issue=241|date=August 2008|pages=136}}</ref>

Say Anything completed one of their first headlining tours in fall 2006, when they toured with [[Piebald (band)|Piebald]] and [[mewithoutYou]].

In the weeks before the release of their third album, Say Anything released several songs from the album on MySpace. They also announced pre-ordered copies could be ordered with a signed CD booklet.

Andy Jackson, a former member of the band and close friend of Bemis, along with Liam Ortmeier was responsible for recording many of the cameo appearances. He recorded some cameos while at the [[Warped Tour 2007]] with [[Hot Rod Circuit]] and others in his home studio.

Though Max has explained that he was very proud of ''[[In Defense of the Genre]]'', he described it as being more of an "homage to sort of a lot of the bands that we liked and, like, a style that we respected." He then explained that the new album would be "more concise and would be a bit more original, I want to say, and sort of pop out like [[Is a Real Boy]] did." He also explained that this CD has both the catchiest and most mature songs they've ever recorded and called it a "step forward."<ref name="inthestudio.sayanythingmusic.com">{{cite web |url=http://inthestudio.sayanythingmusic.com/blog/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-04-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101032150/http://inthestudio.sayanythingmusic.com/blog/ |archive-date=2010-01-01}}</ref>

In 2009, Max and his wife, [[Sherri DuPree]] (From the band [[Eisley]]) formed a small side project named "Perma" and were selling the demo during the 2009 tour.

In early 2010, the band announced that they will be opening for [[Angels and Airwaves]] on their LOVE tour which kicked off on April 5.

In August 2010, Max announced that he will be releasing a "lo-fi" post-punk album in Fall 2010 under the name "Max Bemis and The Painful Splits."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100901233527/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/max_bemis_reveals_side_project_release/ Altpress.com] </ref>

On December 28, 2012, it was announced via Say Anything's Facebook page that Coby had left the band on good terms. Max Bemis stated the following in regards to seeking a new drummer "Say Anything will continue on without Coby but we will not be seeking a replacement drummer to play on the records we put out, as Coby and his style of drumming is, in many senses, irreplaceable; rather we plan on having a multitude of drummers play on our material. Say Anything on record will now be identified in the same way Nine Inch Nails is, in that it’s pretty much me and whoever I choose to play with at the time. Live shows will continue to have their own identity including Jake, Jeff, Parker, Adam, and whoever plays drums for us live. The band couldn’t be further from breaking up, and as I’ve said recently, we plan on releasing music as Say Anything forever, and already have a lot in the works."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sayanythingmusic.com/|title=Say Anything|website=Sayanythingmusic.com|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

=== ''All My Friends Are Enemies: Early Rarities'' (2013–2014) ===

The band's record, ''[[Hebrews (Album)|Hebrews]]'', was released June 10, 2014 on Equal Vision Records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.equalvision.com/post/80684558763/say-anything-announce-new-album-hebrews-to-be|title=Equal Vision Records|website=Blog.equalvision.com|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> The album was the first album that was self-produced by front-man [[Max Bemis]]. Bemis worked in the studio with audio engineer [[Garron DuPree]] for many months while recording the album at [[Max Bemis|Bemis]] and [[Garron DuPree|Dupree]]'s own studio in Tyler, TX. The album was mixed by mix engineer Brad Wood, and mastered by Emily Lazar.

The album was met with positive reception by fans and critics upon its release, and the group embarked on a successful headlining tour in support of the album in the summer of 2014.

===''I Don't Think It Is'' (2016–2017)===
At about midnight EST on February 4, 2016, Say Anything released ''[[I Don't Think It Is]]'' without any prior announcement besides several teaser posts the day before.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musictimes.com/articles/64317/20160204/anything-release-stream-surprise-album-dont-think-listen.htm|title=Say Anything Streams Surprise Album 'I Don't Think It Is' Ahead of Friday Release|author=Haskoor, Michael|date=4 February 2016|access-date=4 February 2016|publisher=Music Times}}</ref> The album was co-produced by Bemis and Darren King of [[Mutemath]], who also played drums and percussion, as well as Liam Ortmeier, who briefly appeared in previous works on guitar. The record was mixed by [[Will Yip]] and featured contributions by members of [[The Hotelier]], [[Tiny Moving Parts]], [[Eisley]], [[Japanese Breakfast]] and others.

In 2017 it was announced drummer Reed Murray would be leaving the band. He was then replaced by Remington DuPree of [[Eisley]] for the band's ''[[In Defense of the Genre]]'' tenth anniversary tour.

The band announced their signing to [[Dine Alone Records]] at [[South by Southwest]] 2018 and revealed the existence of a forthcoming LP produced by [[Will Yip]].

===''Oliver Appropriate'' and hiatus (2018)===
On August 16, 2018, Bemis released a nine-page letter to fans detailing the band's forthcoming record, his future plans for Say Anything, and struggles with his own sexuality and drug use.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eisley.com/SA/SAY_ANYTHING%E2%80%93%E2%80%93A_GOODBYE_SUMMATION.pdf|title=Say Anything–A Goodbye Summation|website=Eisley.com|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref> Say Anything's final LP for the time being, ''[[Oliver Appropriate]]'', was released on January 25, 2019, via Dine Alone Records. The album is a purported sequel to ''[[...Is a Real Boy]]'', featuring an adult version of the narrator fictionalized on that record who struggles with his own sexuality, leading to a violent conclusion. Bemis stated his intention to "sort of, kind of end" the band, but that the project would also likely return in the future to record and perform again. As for now, Bemis is finished with "the traditional music thing" and there will be no tour in support of the new album,  nor any scheduled live performances in the near future. However, he went on a solo tour in 2019 where he played acoustic versions of Say Anything and Perma songs. During the tour, he confirmed that Say Anything would eventually return.

==Style==

===Themes and influences===
Say Anything's music falls into the [[indie rock]], [[Emo (music)|emo]] and [[pop punk]] <!--Provide sources before adding Genres--> genres. They can most easily be identified by their sardonic, literary sense of humor balanced out with a sense of intense catharsis.<ref name=Allmusic>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p668067|pure_url=yes}}|title=Say Anything Overview |access-date=2008-02-01|publisher=Allmusic |last=Apar |first=Corey |author2=Leahey, Andrew }}</ref> The band, as well as certain artists within the indie/punk scene such as [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]], [[MewithoutYou]], [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]], [[Bright Eyes (band)|Bright Eyes]] and [[Manchester Orchestra]] tend to straddle the line between older fans and a youth oriented audience. Their style incorporates pieces of hardcore,  bombastic arena rock and post-punk.  Bemis, the primary songwriter of Say Anything, stated, "I believe that an artist should let his art be appreciated by anyone who's interested and not 'play favourites'."<ref name=Mammoth/> He also said that lyrics are "based on experience."<ref name=PunkSiteBemisInterview>{{cite web|last=Meyle|first=Alli|url=http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=sayanything|title=Interview with Max Bemis|work=ThePunkSite.com|date=2006-07-22|access-date=2008-08-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019061055/http://www.thepunksite.com/interviews.php?page=sayanything|archive-date=2008-10-19}}</ref> However, due to Bemis' bipolar disorder and his resulting mentality, the themes of the songs are often surreal, bleak, irreverent, personal, and autobiographical. Other themes include distaste with snobbery and hypocrisy. Drugs and mankind's relationship with drugs are also a popular subject in Say Anything's songs, especially on ''[[In Defense of the Genre]]'', which was written and recorded after Bemis' several drug-fueled breakdowns. Specifically, "Admit It!!!", "Yellow Cat (Slash) Red Cat", "Try To Remember, Forget", "The Writhing South", and "Sorry, Dudes, My Bad" include references to Bemis' drug usage. In general, Say Anything tends to draw inspiration from alienation from a flawed society but confers a sense of hope.

Max Bemis was raised "in a strong [[Jewish]] environment."  Many of Bemis' lyrics borrow from his Jewish roots, and contain elements of [[Jewish humor]].  While most of band's earlier songs are free of any such inspiration, the songs of ''[[...Is a Real Boy]]'' and ''In Defense of the Genre'' include references to Jewish heritage.  "[[Alive with the Glory of Love]]," Say Anything's first single, has a main subject of a relationship affected by [[World War II]] and [[the Holocaust]], based on Bemis's grandparents,  while "[[Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too]]" includes mentions of "the old shul" and a rabbi's teachings.  A strong example from ''In Defense'' comes from the lyrics of "Died a Jew". The song includes several references to the Jewish people and [[Jewish history|its history]] along with mentions of "the [[Jesus#Arrest, trial, and death|murder of God]]" and Bemis' departures from [[kosher]].<ref name="Jewish">{{cite web|last=Garrett|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.worldjewishdigest.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=C3F5897C3EEA479699E7D815297A9AE4|title=A Jewish Kind of Pop Song|work=World Jewish Digest|date=2008-02-25|access-date=2008-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306123815/http://www.worldjewishdigest.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=&nm=&type=Publishing&mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&tier=4&id=C3F5897C3EEA479699E7D815297A9AE4|archive-date=March 6, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>  References to religion come again in "Fed to Death" on ''Say Anything'', referring to a 'man from Nazareth' who would one day 'spring to life to smile and clear your name' but until then 'nail yourself upon the cross and hang your head in shame.'

In regards to writing songs for ''...Is a Real Boy'', Bemis stated, "The songs were jam packed with fairly blatant nods to bands I dig ([[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Saves the Day]], [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Faith No More]], [[Fugazi]], etc)." These can be considered some of Say Anything's influences. Other influences at some point cited by the band include [[Botch (band)|Botch]], [[Weezer]], [[The Stooges]], [[Neutral Milk Hotel]], [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], [[Wilco]], and the [[Foo Fighters]]. Also of note, the band has covered songs by [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] ("[[Got Your Money]]"), [[Notorious B.I.G.]] ("No Soul" contains the same hook as the sample in "[[Juicy (The Notorious B.I.G. song)|Juicy]]" although it adheres more closely to the original song "Juicy Fruit" from which the sample for the Notorious B.I.G. song was taken), [[The Four Tops]] ("Sure, Baby...Hold Back" features a chorus lifted from "[[Sugar Pie Honey Bunch]]"), Safety in Numbers ("Dealer"), [[Saves the Day]] ("Jessie and My Whetstone"), and [[Bob Dylan]] ("[[The Man in Me]]").<ref name=SayAnythingBio/><ref name=AP_LTT_164167168/><ref name=DownloadThread>{{cite web|url=http://helios.cp-apollo.com/~sayanyth/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=1925 |title=Say Anything Forum: It's the Download Thread Fools! |access-date=2008-08-02 |publisher=Say Anything |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804213748/http://helios.cp-apollo.com/%7Esayanyth/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t%3D1925%26sid%3D2784e06da73435fdef6b8971656319f7 |archive-date=2008-08-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Max Bemis expounded upon the story of ''In Defense of the Genre'' as well as the differences between that album and ''...Is a Real Boy'' in [http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=246310 an interview with AbsolutePunk.net] on June 19, 2007.<ref name=APnetBemisInterview/>

===Live shows===
During live shows, some members of the group (other than Bemis) sing backing vocals. [[Max Bemis|Bemis]] often sings parts he wrote, but which were sung by guest vocalists on studio recordings. In recent years, Bemis has switched up the lineup of performing musicians, using some permanent members of the groups, while rotating other musicians in and out of the live lineup. Beginning on the "All My Friends Are Enemies – Rarities Tour," Bemis added drummer Reed Murray, and bassist [[Garron DuPree]]. In summer of 2014 on the [[Hebrews (album)|Hebrews]] tour, Bemis recruited ex-Taking Back Sunday member [[Fred Mascherino]], [[Moneen]] guitarist Kenny Bridges, and [[Moving Mountains (band)|Moving Mountains]] vocalist Greg Dunn to replace Jake and Jeff Turner and Parker Case, who were at the time performing with their band XO.

In the midst of the "Me Too" movement and accusations of sexual harassment against numerous prominent musicians, Bemis announced that the band would no longer perform "Wow, I Can Get Sexual Too" during live shows in 2017. His Twitter post stated that the song portrayed a "sarcastic caricature of someone I’ve never been at all and is no longer appropriate during this crisis."<ref>{{Cite web|date=2017-11-12|title=Say Anything Will Retire "Wow, I Can Get Sexual, Too" from Shows, Saying it's "No Longer Appropriate"|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/11/say-anything-will-retire-wow-i-can-get-sexual-too-from-shows-saying-its-no-longer-appropriate/|access-date=2020-08-31|website=Spin}}</ref>

On September 8th, 2020, frontman Max Bemis performed an online acoustic performance of the bands debut album, "...Is a Real Boy" in its entirety on an online livestream.
