'''Villagers''' are an Irish [[indie folk]] band from [[Dublin]], founded in 2008 by Conor J. O'Brien.

Villagers came to prominence in 2010 with the release of their debut album, ''[[Becoming a Jackal]]''. Released to critical acclaim, the album was shortlisted for the 2010 [[Mercury Prize#Winners and shortlisted nominees|Mercury Prize]] and the [[Choice Music Prize]]. Their second studio album, ''[[Awayland|{Awayland}]]'' was released in 2013. It won the Choice Music Prize that year and was also shortlisted for the 2013 Mercury Prize. In 2015 they released their third album, ''[[Darling Arithmetic]]'', and the following year ''Where Have You Been All My Life?''—a compilation of live reworkings of some of the band's best-known tracks. In May 2016 ''Darling Arithmetic'' won the Ivor Novello award for Best Album. ''The Art of Pretending to Swim'' followed in September 2018.  Villagers' fifth studio album ''Fever Dreams'' was released on 20 August 2021. Villagers have extensively toured Ireland, the UK and Europe, and have made several visits to play in the United States, Japan, Canada and Australia.

In March 2011, Villagers joined [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] on a two-week tour of the U.K. and Ireland.

As part of Record Store Day 2011, Villagers released a live 12" vinyl record, ''Live at the Workman's Club''. The record contains mainly O'Brien performing songs acoustically with occasional piano accompaniment.

In September 2012 the band announced the release of "The Waves", the first single from their follow-up album. While at the time the name of the album wasn't announced, the details for ''[[Awayland|{Awayland}]]'' were released soon afterwards alongside news of a headline tour in February 2013. The band were just about to start a tour supporting [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]] in October 2012. A second single, "Nothing Arrived", was also announced in December 2012 with a release date set for 14 January 2013 in conjunction with the launch of [[Awayland|{Awayland}]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tuppencemagazine.co.uk/entertainment-news/tag/villagers/|title=Villagers news and reviews|date=19 September 2012|access-date=23 December 2012|work=Tuppence Magazine}}</ref>

Whilst on tour supporting [[Awayland|{Awayland}]], the band debuted two new songs; "Occupy Your Mind" and "Hot Scary Summer". On 7 February 2014 "Occupy Your Mind" was released as a single, produced and mixed by James Ford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dominorecordco.com/uk/news/07-02-14/villagers---to-who-it-may-concern/|title=To Who It May Concern|date=Feb 2014}}</ref> As part of Record Store Day 2014, a limited edition clear 7" vinyl version of "Occupy Your Mind" was released.

In early February 2015 the release of their third LP ''[[Darling Arithmetic]]'' was announced for the 10th/13th/14 April in Ireland, the U.K/Europe and the U.S.A respectively. The new album was written, recorded, produced and mixed by Conor O'Brien at his own home, with him playing all instruments on the record, similar to ''Becoming A Jackal''. A tour was announced, with several dates in Ireland, the U.K and throughout Europe, and a show in New York supporting [[Laura Marling]]. In March 2015, when promoting the band's upcoming album and tour in Ireland, O'Brien spoke to GiggingNI.com about the songwriting process on ''Darling Arithmetic'' as well as addressing love and the issue of homophobia.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.giggingni.com/2015/04/interview-villagers-conor-obrien/ |title=INTERVIEW: Villagers' Conor O'Brien |first=Cara |last=Gibney |work=Gigging NI |date=3 April 2015 |access-date=4 February 2016}}</ref>

On 8 January 2016, the band's fourth album - mostly consisting of live versions of previously released songs - was released unter the title ''Where Have You Been All My Life?''<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Villagers|url=https://www.facebook.com/Villagers/photos/a.372718648729.152969.289279718729/10153213414063730/|title=I'm absolutely thrilled to announce the release of a new Villagers album|date=19 October 2015|language=en}}</ref> The band toured worldwide throughout 2016 supporting the album.

==Style==
O'Brien is noted for his dark lyrics – "an eerie sense of disquiet", according to [[The Guardian]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/20/villagers-becoming-a-jackal-cd-review|title=Villagers: Becoming a Jackal|date=5 May 2010|access-date=20 May 2010|work=[[Guardian Media]] | location=London | first=Rosie | last=Swash}}</ref>

Having only just won, he’s still not sure what significance it will have for his musical career. "Like I was saying before about knowing when a song is good, this is a really good time for me in terms of songwriting. I’ve already got six songs written for the next album and am really excited about it." He mentions attending a recent show by an excellent new band called Villagers. "It was so good it just opened up so much for me. I know I’ve got to push myself now. Winning the Choice prize is great – but there’s a lot more to do."}}</ref>
