'''House of Pain''' was an American hip-hop trio who released three albums in the 1990s before lead rapper [[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] left to pursue a solo career. The group's name is a reference to the [[H.&nbsp;G. Wells]] novel ''[[The Island of Dr. Moreau]]'', a reference carried further by the naming of their 2011 tour ''He Who Breaks the Law''. The group is best known for its 1992 hit single "[[Jump Around]]", which reached number 3 in their native United States of America, number 6 in Ireland and number 8 in the United Kingdom. The group broke up in 1996 but returned in 2010, after the trio had been members of [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[La Coka Nostra]] for several years.

==Band history==
===Rise to fame (1991–1993)===
[[Everlast (musician)|Everlast]] teamed up with [[DJ Lethal]] and high school friend [[Danny Boy (rapper)|Danny Boy]] in [[Los Angeles]] to form House of Pain.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book|first= Martin C.|last=Strong|year=2000|title=The Great Rock Discography|edition=5th|publisher=Mojo Books|location=Edinburgh|pages=462–463|isbn=1-84195-017-3}}</ref> They attended [[William Howard Taft Charter High School|Taft High School]]. The group was signed to [[Tommy Boy Records]] and their 1992 debut album ''[[House of Pain (album)|House of Pain]]'' went [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|multi-platinum]], spawning the successful [[DJ Muggs]]-produced single "[[Jump Around]]".<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 24, 2012|title=An Oral History of House of Pain's 'Jump Around'|url=https://www.spin.com/2012/02/house-pain-look-back-20-years-jump-around/|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=Spin}}</ref> This song was also [[remix]]ed twice by [[Pete Rock]], one version featuring a verse from him and one without.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 4, 2021|title=Pete Rock On New Music, Producing Legendary Tracks And Hip-Hop's True Origins|url=https://allhiphop.com/features/pete-rock-on-new-music-producing-legendary-tracks-and-hip-hops-true-origins/|access-date=February 23, 2021|website=AllHipHop.com|language=en-us}}</ref> The album also featured [[Cypress Hill]] member [[B-Real]] on the song "Put Your Head Out" and [[Funkdoobiest]]'s [[Son Doobie]] on "House and the Rising Son", both members of the musical collective known as [[Soul Assassins]].

Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (although Lethal is [[Latvian Americans|Latvian American]]), they toured with other rap and alternative-rock bands after their breakthrough. They participated together with [[Helmet (band)|Helmet]], along with several other rap acts, on the 1993 [[rap rock]] collaborative ''[[Judgment Night (film)|Judgment Night]]'' film [[Judgment Night (soundtrack)|soundtrack]].

===''Same as It Ever Was'' (1994–1995)===
Their follow-up album, 1994's ''[[Same as It Ever Was]]'', went gold despite minimal airplay and no major hits. The first single, "On Point", is noted for taking a swipe at another American rapper who claimed Irish heritage, "Marky Mark" ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) ''("Calvin Klein's no friend of mine/So I don't like Marky")''.<ref>{{Cite web|title="House Of Pain Anthem" by House Of Pain|url=http://www.wefunkradio.com/song/play/415_ay/house+of+pain/house+of+pain+anthem|access-date=2021-03-23|website=WEFUNK Radio}}</ref>

===''Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again'' (1996)===
House of Pain abruptly broke up in 1996 after the release of their third album, ''[[Truth Crushed to Earth Shall Rise Again]]'', which featured guest appearances by rappers [[Sadat X]] of [[Brand Nubian]], [[Guru (rapper)|Guru]] of [[Gang Starr]], [[Divine Styler]] and [[Cokni O'Dire]] of the Scheme Team. On the release date of the album, Everlast announced his departure from the group.

===Split, solo and current affairs (1997–2009)===
From then on, the members continued their separate careers. Danny Boy founded an art company. DJ Lethal became a member of [[nu metal]] band [[Limp Bizkit]], who would cover "Jump Around" at concerts, particularly in Limp Bizkit's early years during the [[Family Values Tour 1998]]. Everlast achieved multi-platinum solo fame in 1998 with his album ''[[Whitey Ford Sings the Blues]].''<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The first single from that album was "[[What It's Like]]". In 2000, a feud between Everlast and [[Eminem]] coincided with the gold-selling ''[[Eat at Whitey's]]'', which included minor hits "[[Black Jesus (song)|Black Jesus]]" and "Black Coffee", and featured a collaboration with [[Carlos Santana]]. After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records' master tapes to [[Warner Bros. Records]], Everlast signed with [[The Island Def Jam Music Group|Island/Def Jam]], and released his ''[[White Trash Beautiful]]'' LP in 2004.

Later the same year [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino Records]], a subdivision of Warner Music, released a hit collection, ''[[Shamrocks & Shenanigans]]'', with singles from Everlast's earlier solo days, the House of Pain and his post-group solo efforts. Before the release, Everlast announced on his official message board that he was not endorsing the compilation album.

Founded by Danny Boy in early 2006, [[La Coka Nostra]] reunited him, Everlast and DJ Lethal for the first time since House of Pain's split. Other group members include [[Ill Bill]] of [[Non Phixion]], and newcomer [[Slaine (rapper)|Slaine]].

===Reunion tours (2010–2011)===
House of Pain reunited at a private event held by [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]] president [[Dana White]] in [[Boston]] on [[Saint Patrick's Day|St. Patrick's Day]] 2009. It was officially announced on August 10, 2010, that House of Pain had reunited and performed their first "official" show in a decade at the second annual [[Epicenter (music festival)|Epicenter music festiva]]<nowiki/>l in [[Fontana, California]], on September 25, 2010. Though Lethal is still a member of the group, he did not join them on their 2011 reunion tour due to prior obligations with [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopcanada.com/2011/02/c-lance-interview/ |title=C-Lance [Interview&#93; · |publisher=Hiphopcanada.com |date=February 12, 2011 |access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iconvsicon.com/2011/01/25/house-of-pain-announces-reunion-tour-to-celebrate-20th-anniversary/ |title=House Of Pain Announces Reunion Tour To Celebrate 20th Anniversary |publisher=Icon vs. Icon |access-date=April 18, 2014}}</ref> In April–May 2011 House of Pain attended the [[Groovin' the Moo]] touring festival in Australia, and also performed at Scotland's [[T in the Park]] festival on July 9, 2011, as well as [[Sonisphere Festival#UK|Sonisphere UK Festival]] on July 12 of the same year.
