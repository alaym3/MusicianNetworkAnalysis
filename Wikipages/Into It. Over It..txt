'''Into It. Over It.''' is the [[indie rock]] solo project of the [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]-based musician Evan Thomas Weiss. It is considered one of the leading acts in the [[emo revival]] scene of the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/2013/11/27/handicapping-emo-revival/ |title=Handicapping the Emo Revival: Who's Most Likely to Pierce the Stigma? |publisher=Chart Attack |access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1503252/ |title=12 Bands To Know From The Emo Revival |publisher=Stereogum |date=2013-10-01 |access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref>

==History==
Evan Weiss grew up in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey]]. His first exposure to the genre of [[emo]] was hearing the band [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] in the seventh grade while browsing a record shop. He continued his interest in music through buying [[Jade Tree (record label)|Jade Tree]] and [[Polyvinyl Record Co.|Polyvinyl]] records and going to local shows in Philadelphia. In the "fourth or fifth grade", Weiss started, with school friends, the band J.A.R., which eventually became The Progress, garnering modest local success. He was unable to convince his bandmates to play in the band full-time, and after their breakup in 2008 he started a solo project under the moniker Into It Over It. He first released music through two unorthodox concept projects: ''52 Weeks'', entailing the writing, recording and release of one song each week for a year (later released as a compilation record); and ''Twelve Towns'', a twelve song project initially released over six separate splits with several different bands and each song being named after a town.<ref>{{cite web|last=Weiss |first=Dan |url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/i-went-to-high-school-with-the-leader-of-the-so-called-emo-revival |title=I Went to High School with the Leader of the So-Called Emo Revival &#124; NOISEY |website=Noisey.vice.com |date=2014-04-03 |access-date=2016-05-23}}</ref> In May 2011, the band made an appearance at Bled Fest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/bled_fest_releases_full_lineup|title=Bled Fest releases full lineup|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|date=March 2, 2011|access-date=July 11, 2017}}</ref> A month later, Weiss released Into It Over It's first studio album, ''[[Proper (album)|Proper]]'' on [[No Sleep Records]], produced by [[Ed Rose]]. In the last two months of the year, Into It Over It supported [[The Swellers]] on their tour of the UK and Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/the_swellers_announce_supporting_acts_for_uk_european_tour|title=The Swellers announce supporting bands for UK/European tour|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|date=October 3, 2011|access-date=December 17, 2017}}</ref> In March and April the next year, Into It Over It supported [[The Wonder Years (band)|The Wonder Years]] on the Glamour Kills Spring 2012 tour in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/polar_bear_club_transit_and_more_confirmed_for_2012_glamour_kills_tour|title=Polar Bear Club, Transit and more confirmed for 2012 Glamour Kills tour|work=Alternative Press|publisher=Alternative Press Magazine, Inc|author=Bird, Michele|date=January 11, 2012|access-date=December 20, 2017}}</ref> To promote the tour, a compilation showcasing the bands covering each others' songs with released.
