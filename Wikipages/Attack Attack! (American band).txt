=== Formation and ''Someday Came Suddenly'' (2007–08) ===
{{main|Someday Came Suddenly}}

Attack Attack! was formed around 2006 when Johnny Franck, Andrew Whiting, Nick White and Andrew Wetzel met Austin Carlile while playing in local high school bands.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = The Globalization of Music in History|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=kjS9PnHJUE4C|publisher = Routledge|date = June 17, 2013|isbn = 9781136626241|language = en|first = Richard|last = Wetzel|pages = 127–130|quote = Andrew is the author's grandson, see notes p. 178.}}</ref> Caleb Shomo joined the band as the keyboardist, and they changed the name to Attack Attack! In 2007 the band entered a local studio where they recorded material that was put up on Myspace to promote their music.<ref name=":0" /> As the oldest member of the band, Wetzel also acted as their manager for most of the year. The band was taken on by manager Eric Rushing of [[The Artery Foundation]] who signed them to [[Rise Records]] in May 2008.<ref name=":0" /> As members of the band were still underage at this point, contractual discussions required parental consent.<ref name=":0" /> The material recorded in 2007 was put together on the EP ''If Guns Are Outlawed, Can We Use Swords?'' (2008). All 8 musicians involved in recording the demos are shown on the cover which include Ricky Lortz and John Holgado (who would replace original bassist Nick White). The band was also signed by booking agent David Shapiro of the Agency Group that resulted in nationwide tours.<ref name=":0" /> In November 2008 they released their debut full-length album, ''[[Someday Came Suddenly]]'', on Rise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicemissions.com/artists/albums/index.php?album_id=9795|title=Attack Attack! - Sunday Came Sundenly|work=Music Emissions - Indie Music|access-date=October 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/someday-came-suddenly-mw0000801542|title=Someday Came Suddenly - Attack Attack!|website=AllMusic|access-date=2016-05-04}}</ref> Many songs on the album were re-recorded tracks originally released on the ‘’If Guns Are Outlawed’’ EP.
