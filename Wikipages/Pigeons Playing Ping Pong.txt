==History==
Pigeons Playing Ping Pong began in 2009. They released their first full-length album titled ''Funk E P'' in 2010.<ref name=chirpradio>{{cite web|title=Q&A WITH PIGEONS PLAYING PING PONG|url=http://chirpradio.org/blog/qa-with-pigeons-playing-ping-pong|publisher=[[Chicago Independent Radio Project]]|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=the570>{{cite web|title=Countdown to #TheBreakdown: Pigeons Playing Ping Pong|url=http://the570.com/countdown-to-thebreakdown-pigeons-playing-ping-pong/|publisher=The 570|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref> This album name is a play on words says vocalist/guitarist Greg Ormont, and unfortunately the name led people to think this first album was just an [[Extended play|EP]]. In July 2014, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong released their second full-length album titled ''Psychology''.<ref name=baltimoresun/><ref name=chirpradio/><ref name=liveforlivemusic>{{cite web|title=Pigeons Playing Ping Pong – Psychology [Review/Stream]|url=http://liveforlivemusic.com/album-reviews/pigeons-playing-ping-pong-psychology-review-stream/|publisher=Live for Live Music|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=jambase>{{cite web|title=Premiere: Pigeons Playing Ping Pong – Zydeko|url=http://www.jambase.com/Articles/122027/Premiere-Pigeons-Playing-Ping-Pong-Zydeko|publisher=[[JamBase]]|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=gratefulweb>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Bobby|title=Pigeons Playing Ping Pong: Psychology – New Music Review|url=http://www.gratefulweb.com/articles/pigeons-playing-ping-pong-psychology-new-music-review|publisher=Grateful Web|accessdate=29 December 2015}}</ref><ref name=glidemagazine>{{cite web|last1=Dickens|first1=Chadbyrne|title=PIGEONS PLAYING PING PONG – PSYCHOLOGY (ALBUM REVIEW)|url=http://www.glidemagazine.com/120485/pigeons-playing-ping-pong-psychology-album-review/|publisher=Glide Magazine|accessdate=30 December 2015}}</ref> Pigeons Playing Ping Pong has hosted Domefest every year since 2009. The location of the festival has changed periodically but is currently held at [[Marvin's Mountaintop]] in Masontown, WV. In a 2017 interview,<ref>{{Citation|last=American Musical Supply|title=Pigeons Playing Ping Pong Interview – AMS Exclusive Interviews|date=2017-02-07|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QlICfkYv5A|accessdate=2017-03-30}}</ref> Greg Ormont (vocals/guitar) said, "We met in college at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County|University of Maryland]] and the dorm project turned into the real thing. We've been playing for over 8 years. We've been touring the country for 4–5 years and just having a blast spreading our high energy psychedelic funk and good vibes. We like to bring the party and show people a diverse time that is positive and fun and everyone leaves a happier person.”

In November 2019, Pigeons Playing Ping Pong announced that they would be releasing their 5th studio album in 2020. It is led by singles "King Kong" and "Dawn A New Day."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pigeonsplayingpingpong.com/new-album-in-2020/|title=New Album In 2020!|last=Pong|first=Pigeons Playing Ping|date=2019-11-05|website=Pigeons Playing Ping Pong|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pigeonsplayingpingpong.com/new-single-out-now/|title=New Single “King Kong” Available Now|last=Pong|first=Pigeons Playing Ping|date=2019-10-18|website=Pigeons Playing Ping Pong|language=en|access-date=2019-11-05}}</ref>
