In early 2014, Otep confirmed on her personal Facebook account and the band account that another album would be made.

In September 2015 Otep announced on her Facebook page that the band had signed a new management deal with Napalm Records, and that a new album would be released in the spring of 2016 (pre-order from winter 2015).

===''Generation Doom'' (2015-2017)===
"Signing with Napalm Records is one of the most exciting alliances I've ever made. I haven't felt this excited to write a new album since 'Sevas Tra.' There's a lot of work to do, a lot of music to write, a lot of things to say, a lot of injustices to confront and a lot of madness to summon and capture. To be able to forge this sacred alchemy with the dark brilliance of producer Howard Benson is a dream come true."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.revolvermag.com/news/otep-announce-new-album-label.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 1, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003194711/http://www.revolvermag.com/news/otep-announce-new-album-label.html |archive-date=October 3, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On February 4, 2016, Otep announced that the album would be titled ''Generation Doom'' and would be released on April 15. They also released the album art on their Facebook page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metalholic.com/otep-to-release-generation-doom-april-15-album-details-unvieled/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=February 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205064950/http://metalholic.com/otep-to-release-generation-doom-april-15-album-details-unvieled/ |archive-date=February 5, 2016 }}</ref>

On April 11, 2016 ''Billboard'' was to stream ''Generation Doom'' in its entirety for 24 hours, but due to its success extended the streaming time to several days.

The music video for the song "In Cold Blood" premiered on April 15, 2016 on Music Choice.

On Record Store Day (April 16, 2016), record stores released a picture vinyl disk of ''Generation Doom''.

On April 20, Napalm Records released the video for "In Cold Blood" on their YouTube page.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axmHHrR7tfY |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 20, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623140804/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axmHHrR7tfY |archive-date=June 23, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

''Generation Doom'' was number 3 of the top 8 Napalm Record sellers in the week of April 23. On April 26 the album reached #7 on the ''Billboard'' Rock Chart, #10 on the Independent Chart and #109 on the Top 200 Albums Chart. On May 7, the album reached #4 on the ''Billboard'' Hard Rock Chart <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/charts/hard-rock-albums|title=Hard Rock Music: Top Hard Rock Albums|website=Billboard.com}}</ref>

===''Kult 45'' (2018–present)===
On May 2, 2018 Otep disclosed the album title and artwork for their eighth album, together with disclosing interviews about the content of the album. The official Napalm announcement read: "You can expect a complete and total mutiny of the senses on Kult 45," says Shamaya. "That said, it's important for fans to know that this record is not just an indictment of Trump. The idea is rather to empower people to stand up and remind them this is our country and we have the power. It's primarily a rallying cry for people with common sense and good-natured patriots to rise up and know that we own this nation."

"Although the album is produced well technically, lyrically, it's very raw. Musically, we explore different genres – we're trying to reach everyone. I don't want to be limited to one genre or to be anchored to a particular space where I can only reach certain political minds. It's important to me that I'm sending a clear and concise message to the Resistance - the people out there bending the barricades and fighting for justice is this country."

Kult 45 was recorded at The Lair in Los Angeles, completely utilizing the same equipment used for OTEP's first album, Sevas Tra (down to Shamaya's vocal microphone, a SHURE Beta 58), in order to create a sound reminiscent of their roots. Kult 45 was self-produced by the band, with assistant engineering from Larry Goetz, Nicolas Schilke and Lizzy Ostro.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://label.napalmrecords.com/blog/?entryID=1356 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516022537/http://label.napalmrecords.com/blog/?entryID=1356 |archive-date=May 16, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
It was also mentioned that the lyrics will tackle subjects like the immigrant crisis, rape culture and the US government.

In an episode of 'Wake and Bake' (a weekly Facebook live stream on the Otep page) Justin Kier said that while creating this album the band had kept the fans in mind. Therefore, making it an album for the fans, rather than for self-exploration.

The first single of the album, "To the Gallows",  was released on May 25, 2018 along with a lyric video.
