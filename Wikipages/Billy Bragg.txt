==Early life==
Bragg was born in 1957 in [[Barking, London|Barking]], Essex,<ref name="ind rebel">{{cite news |first=Deborah|last=Ross|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/billy-bragg-rebel-with-a-cause-127290.html|title=Billy Bragg: Rebel with a cause|work=The Independent|location=London |date=11 November 2002|access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref> one of the sons of Dennis Frederick Austin Bragg, an assistant sales manager to a Barking cap maker and milliner, and his wife Marie Victoria D'Urso, who was of Italian descent.<ref>{{cite news|first=Nick|last=Barratt|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2007/03/31/nosplit/ftdet131.xml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506092320/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/portal/main.jhtml?xml=/portal/2007/03/31/nosplit/ftdet131.xml|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 May 2008|title=Family Detective: Billy Bragg|newspaper=Telegraph|date=9 December 2011|access-date=28 January 2010 |location=London}}</ref> Bragg's father died of lung cancer in 1976,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.billybragg.co.uk/press/story.php?ID=330|title=Tony Parsons and Billy Bragg tell of the devastation of losing parents to lung cancer|publisher=Mirror|date=9 December 2011|access-date=10 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714152833/http://www.billybragg.co.uk/press/story.php?ID=330|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> and his mother in 2011.<ref>{{cite news|first=John|last=Harris|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/26/bragg-profile-new-album-lovesongs|title=Billy Bragg: Barking's Woody Guthrie on 30 years of songs and activism|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=26 March 2013|access-date=3 June 2013}}</ref>

Bragg was educated at Northbury Junior School and Park Modern Secondary School (now part of [[Barking Abbey School|Barking Abbey Secondary School]]{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=15}}) in Barking, where he failed his [[Eleven-plus|eleven-plus exam]], effectively precluding him from going to university.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=16}} However he developed an interest in poetry at the age of twelve, when his English teacher chose him to read a poem he had written for a homework assignment on a local radio station.<ref name=graun>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/04/billy-bragg-a-lover-sings-selected-lyrics-extract |title=Billy Bragg: 'I got this crazy idea I was a poet' |last1=Bragg |first1=Billy |date=4 November 2015 |website=[[theguardian.com]]|access-date=6 November 2015}}</ref> He put his energies into learning and practising the [[guitar]] with his next-door neighbour, Philip Wigg (Wiggy); some of their influences were [[Faces (band)|the Faces]], [[Small Faces]] and [[the Rolling Stones]]. He was also exposed to folk and folk-rock music during his teenage years, citing [[Simon & Garfunkel]] and [[Bob Dylan]] as early influences on his songwriting.<ref name=graun /> 

During the rise of [[punk rock]] and [[New wave music|new wave]] in the late 1970s, [[Elvis Costello]] also served as an inspiration for Bragg.<ref>{{cite magazine |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=4 February 2008|title=Patriot games |url=https://recordcollectormag.com/articles/patriot-games |magazine=[[Record Collector]] |issue=345|access-date=21 August 2021}}</ref> He was also particularly influenced by [[the Clash]], whom he'd seen play live in London in May 1977 on their White Riot Tour, and again at a [[Rock Against Racism]] carnival in April 1978, which he admits was the first time he really stepped into the world of music as it is used for political activism.<ref name="Bragg"/> The experience of the gig and preceding march helped shape Bragg's left-wing politics, having previously "turned a blind eye" to casual racism.<ref name="Bragg"/>

==Career==

===Early career===
In 1977 Bragg formed the [[punk rock]]/[[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] band Riff Raff with Wiggy. The band decamped to rural [[Oundle]] in [[Northamptonshire]] in 1978 to record a series of singles (the first on independent [[Chiswick Records]]) which did not receive wide exposure. After a period of gigging in Northamptonshire and London, they returned to Barking and split in 1980.{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=67–69}} Taking a series of odd jobs including working at Guy Norris' record shop in Barking high street. Bragg became disillusioned with his stalled music career and in May 1981 joined the [[British Army]] as a recruit destined for the [[Queen's Royal Irish Hussars]] of the [[Royal Armoured Corps]]. After completing three months' [[basic training]], he bought himself out for £175 and returned home.{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=69–79}}

Bragg peroxided his hair to mark a new phase in his life and began performing frequent concerts and [[busking]] around London, playing solo with an electric guitar under the name ''Spy vs Spy'' (after [[Spy vs. Spy|the strip]] in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine).{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=84}}

[[File:Billy Bragg shot by Kris Krug.jpg|thumb|280px|Bragg performing at [[South by Southwest]] in 2008]]
His demo tape initially got no response from the record industry, but by pretending to be a television repair man, he got into the office of [[Charisma Records]]' [[A&R]] man [[Peter Jenner]].<ref name="Peel">{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/b/billybragg|work=Radio 1|title=Keeping It Peel|publisher=BBC|access-date=28 January 2010}}</ref> Jenner liked the tape, but the company was near bankruptcy and had no budget to sign new artists. Bragg got an offer to record more demos for music publisher [[Chappell & Co.]], so Jenner agreed to release them as a record. ''[[Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy]]'' (credited to Billy Bragg) was released in July 1983 by Charisma's new imprint, Utility. Hearing DJ [[John Peel]] mention on-air that he was hungry, Bragg rushed to the BBC with a mushroom [[biryani]], so Peel played a song from ''Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy'' albeit at the wrong speed (since the 12" LP was, unconventionally, cut to play at 45rpm). Peel insisted he would have played the song even without the biryani and later played it at the correct speed.<ref name="Peel"/>

Within months Charisma had been taken over by [[Virgin Records]] and Jenner, who had been made redundant, became Bragg's [[Music management|manager]]. [[Stiff Records]]' press officer Andy Macdonald – who was setting up his own record label, [[Go! Discs]] – received a copy of ''Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy''. He made Virgin an offer and the album was re-released on Go! Discs in November 1983, at the fixed low price of £2.99.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=114}} Around this time, [[Andy Kershaw]], an early supporter at [[Radio Aire]] in [[Leeds]], was employed by Jenner as Bragg's tour manager. (He later became a [[BBC]] DJ and TV presenter, and he and Bragg appeared in an episode of the BBC TV programme ''Great Journeys'' in 1989, in which they travelled the Silver Road from [[Potosí]], Bolivia, to the Pacific coast at [[Arica]], Chile.){{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=209–211}}

Though never released as a Bragg single, album track and live favourite "[[A New England]]", with an additional verse, became a Top 10 hit in the UK for [[Kirsty MacColl]] in January 1985. Since MacColl's early death, Bragg always sings the extra verse live in her honour.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kirsty MacColl memorial page|url=http://www.gonetoosoon.org/memorials/kirsty-maccoll|work=Gone Too Soon|access-date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

In 1984, he released ''[[Brewing Up with Billy Bragg]]'', a mixture of political songs (e.g. "It Says Here") and songs of unrequited love (e.g. "The Saturday Boy"). This was followed in 1985 by ''[[Between the Wars (EP)|Between the Wars]]'', an EP of political songs that included a cover version of [[Leon Rosselson]]'s "[[Diggers' Song|The World Turned Upside Down]]". The EP made the Top 20 of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and earned Bragg an appearance on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', singing the title track. Bragg later collaborated with Rosselson on the song, "Ballad of a Spycatcher".<ref>{{cite web|title=Ballad of a Spycatcher|url=http://mainlynorfolk.info/leon.rosselson/records/balladofaspycatcher.html|work=Mainly Norfolk|access-date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

In the same year, he embarked on his first tour of North America, with Wiggy as tour manager, supporting [[Echo & the Bunnymen]].{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=138–142}} The tour began in Washington D.C. and ended in Los Angeles. On the same trip, in New York, Bragg unveiled his "Portastack",{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=139–140}} a self-contained, mobile PA system weighing 35&nbsp;lbs (designed for £500 by engineer Kenny Jones), the wearing of which became an archetypal image of the singer at that time. With it, he was able to busk outside the [[New Music Seminar]], a record industry conference.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=139}}

===Late 1980s and early 1990s===
In 1986 Bragg released ''[[Talking with the Taxman About Poetry]]'', which became his first Top 10 album. Its title is taken from a poem by [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]] and a translated version of the poem was printed on the record's inner sleeve. ''[[Back to Basics (Billy Bragg album)|Back to Basics]]'' is a 1987 collection of his first three releases: ''Life's a Riot with Spy vs Spy'', ''Brewing Up with Billy Bragg'', and ''Between the Wars''. He enjoyed his only Number 1 hit single in May 1988, a cover of [[the Beatles]]' "[[She's Leaving Home]]", a shared A-side with [[Wet Wet Wet]]'s "[[With a Little Help from My Friends]]". Both were taken from a multi-artist re-recording of ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' titled ''[[Sgt. Pepper Knew My Father]]'' coordinated by the ''[[NME]]'' in aid of the charity [[Childline]]. Wet Wet Wet's cover dominated radio airplay and its video was shown over three consecutive weeks on ''Top of the Pops''; in week four, Bragg went on the programme to play his cover, with regular accompanist [[Cara Tivey]] on piano.{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=197–198}}

Bragg released his fourth album, ''[[Workers Playtime (Billy Bragg album)|Workers Playtime]]'', in September 1988. With this album, Bragg added a full backing band and accompaniment, including [[Cara Tivey|Tivey]] on piano, [[Danny Thompson]] on double bass and veteran [[Micky Waller]] on drums. Wiggy earned a co-production credit with [[Joe Boyd]].{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=195}}

In May 1990 Bragg released the political [[mini-LP]] ''[[The Internationale (album)|The Internationale]]'' on his and Jenner's own short-lived label Utility, which operated independently of Go! Discs, to which Bragg was still contracted. The songs were, in part, a return to his solo guitar style, but some featured more complicated arrangements and included a [[brass band]]. The album paid tribute to one of Bragg's influences with the song, "I Dreamed I Saw [[Phil Ochs]] Last Night", which is an adapted version of [[Earl Robinson]]'s song, "[[I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night]]", itself an adaptation of a poem by [[Alfred Hayes (writer)|Alfred Hayes]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Joe Hill|url=https://archive.org/details/raretunes_203_joe-hill|access-date=17 October 2013}}</ref> Though the album only reached Number 34 in the UK Charts, Bragg described it as "a reassertion of my rights as an individual ... and a childish two fingers [to Go! Discs boss Andy Macdonald, who'd recently signed a distribution deal with entertainment industry giant PolyGram]."{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=207–209}}

[[File:Billy Bragg at Bestival 2008.jpg|thumb|upright|Performing with [[The Imagined Village]] at [[Camp Bestival]], 20 July 2008]]
His sixth studio album ''[[Don't Try This at Home (Billy Bragg album)|Don't Try This at Home]]'' was recorded in the shadow of the build-up to the [[Gulf War]] and subsequent ground war, inspiring the track "Rumours of War". Although there is social comment ("The Few", "North Sea Bubble"), it was intended as a more commercial pop album, released in September 1991. (Bragg called it "a very long-range attempt to convert the ball between the posts."{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=225}}). The first single was the upbeat "[[Sexuality (Billy Bragg song)|Sexuality]]", which, despite an accessible video and a dance remix on the B-side, only reached Number 27 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Following overtures by rival label [[Chrysalis Records|Chrysalis]], Bragg and Jenner had been persuaded by Go! Discs' Andy and Juliet Macdonald to sign a four-album deal for a million pound advance; in return he would promote the album with singles and videos.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=221}} A more commercial sound and aggressive marketing had no appreciable effect on album sales, and after a grueling, 13-month world tour with a full band (the Red Stars, led by Wiggy), and a period of forced convalescence after an [[appendicitis]], Bragg left Go! Discs in summer 1992, paying back the remainder of his advance in return for all rights to his back catalogue.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=232}}

===Late 1990s and 2000s===
Bragg released the album ''[[William Bloke]]'' in 1996 after taking time off to help new partner Juliet Wills raise their son Jack. (There is a reference to him in the track "Brickbat": "Now you'll find me with the baby, in the bathroom.")<ref>{{cite web|title=Brickbat|url=http://www.billybragg.co.uk/music/album.php?albumID=14&songID=59|access-date=6 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129020854/http://www.billybragg.co.uk/music/album.php?albumID=14&songID=59|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> After the ambitious instrumentation of ''[[Don't Try This at Home (Billy Bragg album)|Don't Try This at Home]]'', it was a simpler record, musically, more personal and even spiritual, lyrically (its title a pun on the name of 18th-century English poet [[William Blake]], who is referenced in the song "Upfield").{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=248–250}}

Around that time, [[Nora Guthrie]] (daughter of American folk artist [[Woody Guthrie]]) asked Bragg to set some of her father's unrecorded lyrics to music. The result was a collaboration with the band [[Wilco]] and [[Natalie Merchant]] (with whom Bragg had worked previously). They released the album ''[[Mermaid Avenue]]'' in 1998,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mermaid Avenue|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/mermaid-avenue|work=Nonesuch catalogue|access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref> and ''[[Mermaid Avenue Vol. II]]'' in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mermaid Avenue Vol II|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/albums/mermaid-avenue-vol-ii|work=Nonesuch catalogue|access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref> The first album was nominated for a [[Grammy]] in the Best Contemporary Folk Album category. A third batch, ''Mermaid Avenue Vol III'', and ''The Complete Sessions'' followed in 2012 to mark Woody Guthrie's centennial.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mermaid Avenue: The Complete Sessions|url=http://www.billybragg.co.uk/store/index.php/music/mermaid-avenue-the-complete-sessions.html|work=Bragg's Emporium|access-date=10 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621171719/http://www.billybragg.co.uk/store/index.php/music/mermaid-avenue-the-complete-sessions.html|archive-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> A rift with Wilco over mixing and sequencing the first album led to Bragg recruiting his own band, The Blokes, to promote the album live. The Blokes included keyboardist [[Ian McLagan]], who had been a member of Bragg's boyhood heroes [[The Faces]]. The documentary film ''[[Man in the Sand]]'' depicts the roles of Nora Guthrie, Bragg, and Wilco in the creation of the ''Mermaid Avenue'' albums.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/237191/Billy-Bragg-and-Wilco-Man-in-the-Sand/overview |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621161648/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/237191/Billy-Bragg-and-Wilco-Man-in-the-Sand/overview |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 June 2008 |title=Billy Bragg and Wilco: Man in the Sand (1999) |author=|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[Baseline (database)|Baseline]] & [[All Movie Guide]]|date=2008    <!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |access-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

A developing interest in [[English nationalism|English national identity]], driven by the rise of the [[British National Party|BNP]] and his own move from London to rural [[Dorset]] in 1999, informed his 2002 album ''[[England, Half-English]]'' (whose single, "Take Down The Union Jack" put him back on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the Queen's Golden Jubilee year<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3171574.stm|title=Bragg's 20 years on campaign trail|publisher=BBC Entertainment |access-date=10 June 2014}}</ref>) and his 2006 book ''The Progressive Patriot''. The book expressed his view that English socialists can reclaim patriotism from the right wing. He draws on Victorian poet [[Rudyard Kipling]] for an inclusive sense of Englishness.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xppmt Rhyme and Reason], [[BBC Radio 4]], 25 January 2011.</ref> In 2007 Bragg moved closer to his English folk music roots by joining the [[World of Music, Arts and Dance|WOMAD]]-inspired collective [[The Imagined Village]], who recorded an album of updated versions of traditional English songs and dances and toured through that autumn.<ref name="The Imagined Village">{{cite web |url = http://www.imaginedvillage.com/|title = The Imagined Village Official Website|access-date = 18 November 2014}}</ref>

In December Bragg previewed tracks from his forthcoming album ''[[Mr. Love & Justice]]'' at a one-off evening of music and conversation to mark his 50th birthday at London's [[South Bank]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wherediditallgorightblog.wordpress.com/2007/12/10/a-big-boy-now/|title=A big boy now |publisher= Never Knowingly Underwhelmed|access-date= 10 June 2014}}</ref> The album was released in March 2008, the second Bragg album to be named after a book by [[Colin MacInnes]] after ''England, Half-English''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/colin-macinnes/|title=Colin MacInnes|publisher=Fantastic Fiction|date=18 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.faber.co.uk/9780571252848-england-half-english.html|title=England Half English|publisher=Faber|date=18 November 2014}}</ref> The same year, during the [[NME Awards]] ceremony, Bragg sang a duet with British solo act [[Kate Nash]].

In 2009, Bragg was invited by London's [[South Bank]] to write new lyrics for "[[Ode to Joy]]", the final movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] (original libretto by [[Friedrich Schiller]]), since adopted as an international anthem of unity. The London Philharmonic Orchestra performed it at the Royal Festival Hall in front of [[Elizabeth II|the Queen]] and Bragg met her afterwards to earn "brownie points" with his mother, also in attendance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-mitchell/billy-braggs-new-odes-to-_b_1321000.html|first=Greg|last=Mitchell|date=3 May 2012|title=Billy Bragg's New Odes to Woody Guthrie—and Beethoven|work=The Huffington Post|access-date= 9 September 2014}}</ref>

===2010s===
He was involved in the play ''Pressure Drop'' at the [[Wellcome Collection]] in London in April and May 2010. The production, written by Mick Gorden, and billed as "part play, part gig, part installation", featured new songs by Bragg. He performed during the play with his band, and acted as [[Master of ceremonies|compere]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/the-identity-project/play-pressure-drop.aspx|work=Wellcome collection|title=Pressure Drop|date=April–May 2010|access-date=11 May 2010|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/67JqGT52T?url=http://www.wellcomecollection.org/whats-on/the-identity-project/play-pressure-drop.aspx|archive-date=30 April 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 18 March 2013, five years after ''Mr. Love & Justice'', Bragg released the studio album ''[[Tooth & Nail (Billy Bragg album)|Tooth & Nail]]''. Recorded in five days at the home studio of musician/producer [[Joe Henry]] in [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]] it featured 11 original songs, including one written for the Bush Theatre and a Woody Guthrie cover. Stylistically, it continued to explore genres of [[Americana (music)|Americana]] and [[Alternative country]], a natural progression since ''Mermaid Avenue''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tooth-nail-mw0002484063|title=Tooth & Nail|publisher=Allmusic.com|date=5 June 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/art/blog/2013/06/billy-bragg-the-sherpa-of-heartbreak.html|title= Billy Bragg, The Sherpa of Heartbreak|publisher=PBS|date=5 June 2013}}</ref> The album was a commercial success, becoming his best charting record since 1991's ''Don't Try This at Home''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/billy%20bragg/|title= Billy Bragg: Official UK Chart Positions|publisher=Official UK Chart Company|date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

In February 2014, Bragg started a series of "radio shows" on [[Spotify]], in which he talked listeners through self-curated playlists of "his favourite tracks and artists, and uncovering some little-known musical gems."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicweek.com/news/read/bill-bragg-and-spotify-launch-radio-shows/057578|title=Billy Bragg and Spotify launch 'radio shows'|first=Tom|last=Ingham|publisher=MusicWeek.com|date=10 February 2014}}</ref> On 14 April 2014, Bragg put out ''Live at the Union Chapel'', a souvenir album and DVD of a show he played on 5 June 2013 at the [[Union Chapel, Islington|Union Chapel]] in London, featuring songs from ''Tooth & Nail'' as well as favourites from his back catalogue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.music-news.com/ShowNews.asp?nItemID=77995|title=Billy Bragg to release Live at the Union Chapel|publisher=Music News|date=3 April 2014}}</ref>

In February 2016, Bragg was given the Trailblazer Award at the inaugural Americana Music Association UK Awards in London.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://americanamusic.org/news/uk-americana-awards-billy-bragg-be-honored-feb-3-london|date=17 December 2015 |title=Billy Bragg to be Honoured Feb 3 in London | work=Americana Music Association}}</ref> Following that, in September he was given the Spirit of Americana Free Speech Award at the Americana Music Association US Awards in Nashville.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://americanamusic.org/news/americana-music-association-announces-lifetime-achievement-honorees|date=30 August 2016 |title=Americana Music Association Announces Lifetime Achievement Honorees | work=Americana Music Association}}</ref>

In August 2016, Bragg released his eleventh album, a collaboration with Joe Henry, ''[[Shine a Light (Billy Bragg and Joe Henry album)|Shine a Light: Field Recordings from the Great American Railroad]]'', recorded at various points on a journey between [[Chicago]] and [[Los Angeles]] by train in March. It reached number 28 in the UK Album Charts<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/shine%20a%20light%20-%20field%20recordings%20from/|date=6 October 2016 |title=Shine a Light: Field Recordings official UK Chart position | work=Official UK Charts}}</ref> and number one in the UK Americana album chart.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/americana-albums-chart/20160930/americana/|date=30 September 2016 |title=Shine a Light: Field Recordings official UK Americana Album Chart debut | work=Official UK Charts}}</ref> The pair started a dual ''Shine a Light'' tour at the [[Americana Music Festival and Conference|Americana Music Festival]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] in September 2016, and taking them across the [[United States of America|States]] and [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. In April 2017, they played in [[Australia]].

[[Faber and Faber|Faber]] published Bragg's second nonfiction book (after 2013's ''The Progressive Patriot''), ''Roots, Radicals and Rockers'' in June 2016, a history of the British [[skiffle]] movement, tracing the form from its 1950s boom back to [[ragtime]], [[blues]], [[jazz]] and American [[folk music]]. On [[BBC]] Music Day 2017, he helped unveil a blue plaque marking the studio (Trident) where the late [[David Bowie]] recorded two classic albums and the single ''Space Oddity'', in [[Soho]]; he joined album sleeve designer George Underwood and [[BBC Radio London]]’s [[Robert Elms]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.musicweek.com/media/read/bbc-music-day-blue-plaque-unveiled-in-honour-of-david-bowie/068821|date=15 June 2017 |title=BBC Music Day Blue Plaque unveiled in honour of David Bowie| work=Music Week}}</ref> In November, he released all six tracks from the [[mini-album]] ''[[Bridges Not Walls]]'' as downloads through the Billy Bragg website,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.withguitars.com/billy-bragg-new-album-bridges-not-walls-released-november-3rd/|date=9 October 2017 |title=Billy Bragg – New album Bridges Not Walls released November 3rd| website=With Guitars}}</ref> followed by the single ''Full English Brexit'' through Cooking Vinyl.

In April 2018, Bragg was invited to deliver a [[Bank of England]] Flagship Seminar; his presentation was titled ''Accountability: the Antidote to Authoritarianism''. The speech was made available on the Bank of England's website.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/events/2018/april/one-bank-flagship-seminar-billy-bragg|date=24 April 2018 |title=One Bank Flagship Seminar - Billy Bragg| website=Bank of England}}</ref> At the [[Ivor Novello Awards]] (''the Ivors'') in May, he accepted the [[PRS for Music|PRS]] Outstanding Contribution to British Music award.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theivors.com/the-ivors-2018/|date=31 May 2018|title=The 63rd Ivor Novello Awards were presented on Thursday 31st May at the Grosvenor House, Park Lane, London|website=The Ivors|access-date=11 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180717154009/http://theivors.com/the-ivors-2018/|archive-date=17 July 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Also in May, his official biography ''Still Suitable for Miners'' was published in a new, 20th anniversary updated edition.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/1116107/billy-bragg/9780753552711/|date=24 May 2018 |title=Billy Bragg by Andrew Collins| website=Penguin/Virgin Books}}</ref>

He ended 2018 touring New Zealand and Australia. In [[Auckland]], he road-tested a new live format for 2019 (first tried out in [[Toronto]]), ''One Step Forward, Two Steps Back''. The idea was to play three consecutive shows over three nights at each venue: the first night a current, mixed Bragg set; the second from his first three albums; the third from his second three albums. "It’s a way of keeping things interesting," he said.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.musicglue.com/billy-bragg/|date=2019 |title=Billy Bragg gigs| website=Musicglue}}</ref> The tour would cover the [[United States]] and the [[UK]] and [[Ireland]] throughout 2019.

In May, [[Faber and Faber]] published ''The Three Dimensions of Freedom'', a short polemic by Bragg intended, according to the publisher's blurb, to "protect ourselves from encroaching tyranny." The author urges readers to "look beyond [the] one-dimensional notion of what it means to be free" and "by reconnecting liberty to equality and accountability, restore ... the three dimensions of freedom."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.billybragg.co.uk/product/the-three-dimensions-of-freedom/|date= 2 May 2019 |title=The Three Dimensions of Freedom| website=billybragg.com}}</ref>

==Politics and activism==
[[File:Billy Bragg on Morrissey, Cynicism, and Misogyny.webm|thumb|Bragg talking to the crowd at a rally in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], shortly after the [[shooting of Michael Brown]]]]
For all of Bragg's 30-year-plus recording career he has been involved with grassroots, broadly leftist, political movements, and this is often reflected in his lyrics. He has also recorded and performed cover versions of famous socialist anthems such as "[[The Internationale]]" and "[[The Red Flag]]". Bragg said in an interview: "I don't mind being labelled a political songwriter. The thing that troubles me is being dismissed as a political songwriter."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gazette|first=The|url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=a855dd81-39ba-4646-b1ae-ee720ad8a704|title=Interview: Billy Bragg|publisher=Canada.com|date=16 June 2008|access-date=10 June 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321062743/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=a855dd81-39ba-4646-b1ae-ee720ad8a704|archive-date=21 March 2014}}</ref> Bragg has cited [[the Clash]] as a strong influence on his politically-themed material and activism:<blockquote>It wasn't so much their lyrics as what they stood for and the actions they took. That became really important to me. [[Phil Collins]] might write a [[Another Day in Paradise|song about the homeless]], but if he doesn't have the action to go with it he's just exploiting that for a subject. I got that from the Clash, and I try to remain true to that tradition as best I can.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://ew.com/article/2000/06/30/billy-bragg-clash/ | title= Bragg-ing Rites |work=Entertainment Weekly |first=Rob |last=Brunner |date=30 June 2000 |access-date=9 February 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

===From 1983 to 1997===
Bragg's politics were focused by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]'s 144-seat majority landslide at the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]]. He told his biographer, "By 1983, the scales had fallen from my eyes."{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=144}} His record label boss Andy Macdonald observed that "his presence onstage took on more of the avenging angel."{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=145}} Bragg was at the forefront of music's influence on the [[UK miners' strike (1984-1985)|1984 miners' strike]], and played many benefit gigs in towns close to coalfields such as Newport and Sunderland.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=146}} He also released an EP during this year titled "Between the Wars", which connected struggles of class solidarity to the present issue. This single was his most successful up until this point, reaching number 15 on the charts.{{sfn|Tranmer|2012|pp=79–84}} The following year, after playing a short [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]-sponsored Jobs For Youth tour, he joined other like-minded activists in the public eye to form the musicians' alliance [[Red Wedge]], which promoted Labour's cause – and in turn lobbied the party on youth issues – in the run-up to the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]],{{sfn|Tranmer|2001}} with a national tour in 1986 alongside [[The Style Council]], [[Jerry Dammers]] and [[The Communards]].

Bragg travelled twice to the [[Soviet Union]] in 1986, the year [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] started to promote the policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. He played a gig in Leningrad, and the Festival of Song in the Struggle for Peace in Kiev.{{sfn|Collins|2018|pp=181–183}}

[[File:Billy Bragg on After Dark.JPG|left|thumb|On TV series ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'' in 1987]]
On 12 June 1987, the night after Labour lost that year's general election, Bragg appeared on a [[After Dark (TV series)#Teresa Gorman and "Is Britain Working?"|notable edition]] of the [[Channel 4]] discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]'', alongside [[David Selbourne]], [[Teresa Gorman]] and [[Hilary Hook]] among others. ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote "A show called ''Is Britain Working?'' brought together victorious Tory MP Teresa Gorman; ...Helen from the Stonehenge [[Peace Convoy|Convoy]]; old colonialist Colonel Hilary Hook... and Adrian, one of the jobless. It was a perfect example of the chemistry you can get. There were unlikely alliances (Bragg and Hook)".<ref name="Independent19880219">''The Independent'', 19 February 1988</ref> Later Gorman "stormed off the set, claiming she had been misled about the nature of the programme"<ref name="Brown">Maggie Brown, ''A Licence To Be Different'', BFI, 2007.</ref> "She told...Bragg: 'You and your kind are finished.

===Labour in government===
In 1999, he was invited to appear before a commission that debated possible [[reform of the House of Lords]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/400230.stm |title=Ensuring the will of the people|work=BBC News|date=22 July 1999|access-date=28 January 2010}}</ref> at which he put forward what became known as "the Bragg Method": the arrangement of the Upper House to proportionally reflect the results of a general election. "Trying to make it sexy is impossible," he said.{{sfn|Collins|2018|p=272}}

At the time of the [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001 general election]], Bragg promoted [[tactical voting]] in an attempt to unseat Conservative Party candidates in his adopted home county [[Dorset]], particularly in [[South Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|South Dorset]] and [[West Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|West Dorset]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2001/apr/19/politics.election2001 |title=Billy Bragg drives in voting wedge |last1=Ward |first1=Lucy|date=19 April 2001 |website=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=6 October 2013}}</ref> The Conservatives did indeed narrowly lose South Dorset to the Labour Party.

Bragg has been an opponent of fascism, racism,<ref name="Bragg" /> [[bigotry]], [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]], and is a supporter of a multi-racial Britain. As a result, he has conflicted with far-right groups such as the [[British National Party]] (BNP). In a 2004 ''[[The Guardian]]'' article, Bragg was quoted as saying:<blockquote>The British National Party would probably make it into a parliament elected by [[proportional representation]], too. It would shine a torch into the dirty little corner where the BNP defecate on our democracy, and that would be much more powerful than duffing them up in the street – which I'm also in favour of.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/18/constitution.lords|title=Jonathan Freedland: End of the peer show|work=The Guardian|date=18 February 2004|access-date=28 January 2010|location=London}}</ref></blockquote>

During the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]] campaign in the [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow constituency]], Bragg endorsed [[Oona King]], the Labour Party's pro-[[Iraq War]] candidate, over [[George Galloway]], the left-wing socialist anti-war candidate from the [[Respect Party]]; due to a belief that splitting the left-wing vote would allow the Conservatives to win the seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.redpepper.org.uk/article601.html|title=Rockin' the vote: Billy Bragg for Blair? – Red Pepper|publisher=Red Pepper|date=March 2005|access-date=28 January 2010}}</ref> Galloway overturned King's 10,000-strong majority to become the Respect Party's only MP.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/frontpage/4519575.stm|title=Galloway's East End street fight|work=BBC News|date=6 May 2005|access-date=28 January 2010}}</ref>

At the [[NME Awards]] in 2007, on the fifth anniversary of [[Joe Strummer]]'s death, Bragg founded Jail Guitar Doors (taking its name from a [[Jail Guitar Doors|song by the Clash]]), an organisation aimed at supplying instruments to prisons and encouraging prisoners to address problems in a non-confrontational way.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jailguitardoors.org.uk |title=Jail Guitar Doors |access-date=23 January 2011}}</ref> An American chapter of the organisation was launched in 2009 by [[MC5]]'s [[Wayne Kramer (guitarist)|Wayne Kramer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jailguitardoors.org/about.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322233616/http://www.jailguitardoors.org/about.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 March 2010|title=Jail Guitar Doors: Our History|access-date=18 November 2014}}</ref>

In January 2010, Bragg stated his intention to withhold his income tax as a protest against the [[Royal Bank of Scotland]]'s plan to pay bonuses of approximately of £1,500,000,000 to staff in its investment banking business. Bragg set up a Facebook group, made appearances on radio and television news programmes, and made a speech at [[Speakers' Corner]] in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] saying, "Millions are already facing stark choices: are they willing to work longer hours for less money, or would they rather be unemployed? I don’t see why the bankers at RBS shouldn’t be asked the same."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/banking_and_finance/article7010492.ece#cid=OTC-RSS&attr=2015164 |title=BraggRBS |work=The Times |location=UK |access-date=1 February 2010 |first=Anushka |last=Asthana}}</ref>

===From 2010 to 2014===
In the 2010 general election, Bragg supported the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] because "they've got the best manifesto".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7616323/General-Election-2010-Billy-Bragg-pledges-to-support-Liberal-Democrats.html|location=London |work=The Daily Telegraph |title=General Election 2010: Billy Bragg pledges to support Liberal Democrats |date=22 April 2010}}</ref>

Bragg was also very active in his hometown of [[Barking, London|Barking]] as part of [[Searchlight (magazine)|''Searchlight'']] magazine's [[Hope not Hate]] campaign, where the BNP's leader [[Nick Griffin]] was standing for election. At one point during the campaign Bragg squared up to BNP [[London Assembly|London Assembly Member]] [[Richard Barnbrook]], calling him a "Fascist racist" and saying "when you're gone from this borough, we will rebuild this community". The BNP came third on election day.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMA3-vVEXL4| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211113/SMA3-vVEXL4| archive-date=2021-11-13 | url-status=live|title=Bragg Vs Barnbrook in Barking & Dagenham |publisher=Searchlight|date=19 April 2010 |access-date=23 February 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In January 2011, news sources reported that 20 to 30 residents of Bragg's Dorset hometown, [[Burton Bradstock]], had received anonymous letters viciously attacking him and his politics, and urging residents to oppose him in the village. He claimed that a BNP supporter was behind the letters, which argued that Bragg is a hypocrite for advocating socialism while living a wealthy lifestyle, and referred to him as anti-British and pro-immigration.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/06/billy-bragg-neighbours-hate-mail |title=Billy Bragg's neighbours urged to drive him out of village |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 January 2011 |access-date=6 January 2011 |first=Steven |last=Morris}}</ref>

In July 2011 Bragg joined the growing protests over the [[News of the World phone hacking affair]] with the release of his "Never Buy the Sun" single, which references many of the scandal's key points including the Milly Dowler case, police bribes and associated political fallout. It also draws on the 22-year Liverpool boycott of ''The Sun'' for their [[Hillsborough disaster and The Sun|coverage of the Hillsborough disaster]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billybragg.co.uk/sun.php |title=Never buy The Sun |access-date=13 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714113634/http://www.billybragg.co.uk/sun.php |archive-date=14 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In October 2011, Bragg joined the [[Occupy Movement]] protests in the [[City of London]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07237-billy-bragg-interview |title=Protest And Occupation: Billy Bragg Interviewed On The Future Of The Left |last1=Perry |first1=Kevin E.G.|date=25 October 2011 |website=[[The Quietus]] |access-date=6 October 2013}}</ref>
In 2013, despite his scathing criticism of [[Margaret Thatcher]], he urged people not to celebrate the death of the former Conservative Prime Minister:<blockquote>The death of Margaret Thatcher is nothing more than a salient reminder of how Britain got into the mess that we are in today. Of why ordinary working people are no longer able to earn enough from one job to support a family; of why there is a shortage of decent affordable housing... of why cynicism and greed became the hallmarks of our society. Raising a glass to the death of an infirm old lady changes none of this. The only real antidote to cynicism is activism.

In June 2014, Bragg joined other musicians (including [[Radiohead]]'s [[Ed O'Brien]]) in backing a call for the EU to intervene in a dispute between YouTube and independent labels. According to a BBC News report, the video-streaming site was offering "non-negotiable contracts" to its planned, [[Spotify]]-like music-subscription service to labels such as [[XL Recordings]], [[4AD]], [[Cooking Vinyl]] and [[Domino Recording Company|Domino]] "accompanied by the threat that music videos they have posted to their YouTube channels will be blocked from site altogether if they do not agree to the terms."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-27694353|date=4 June 2014 |title=Billy Bragg and other indie musicians blast YouTube rates | work=BBC News}}</ref>

Bragg wrote an article for the ''Guardian'' publication on 16 September, in which he addressed the objections he had previously received from people who conflated Scottish nationalism with the far-right ethos of the BNP. He described the independence campaign as "civic nationalism" and his opinion piece concluded:

<blockquote>
Support for Scottish self-determination might not fit neatly into any leftwing pigeonhole, but it does chime with an older progressive tradition that runs deep in English history – a dogged determination to hold the over-mighty to account. If, during the constitutional settlement that will follow the referendum, we in England can rediscover our Roundhead tradition, we might yet counter our historic weakness for ethnic nationalism with an outpouring of civic engagement that creates a fairer society for all.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Billy Bragg|title=Exclusive: Scottish nationalism and British nationalism aren't the same|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/16/scottish-nationalism-british-westminster-class|access-date=18 September 2014|work=The Guardian|date=16 September 2014}}</ref></blockquote>

In August 2016, ''The Times'' reported that at the [[Edinburgh International Book Festival|Edinburgh Book Festival]], Bragg had said: "I worry about Jeremy that he's a kind of twentieth century Labour man", and that "we need to be reaching out to people". Described as a "previously loyal supporter", who has "lent his support to Mr Corbyn on numerous occasions since he became Labour leader", ''The Times'' quoted Bragg: "I don't have a simple answer. My hope is that the party does not split and that we resolve this stalemate". Corbyn at the time was campaigning in an enforced [[2016 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|second leadership election]] in the summer of 2016.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sanderson|first=David|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/corbyn-is-stuck-in-the-last-century-says-bragg-trhv6tqvj|title=Corbyn is stuck in the last century says Bragg|work=The Times|location=London|date=16 August 2016|access-date=16 August 2016}} {{subscription required}}</ref>
