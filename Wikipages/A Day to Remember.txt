'''A Day to Remember''' (often abbreviated '''ADTR''', and previously known as '''End of an Era''') is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Ocala, Florida]], founded in 2003 by guitarist [[Tom Denney]] and drummer Bobby Scruggs. They are known for their amalgamation of [[metalcore]] and [[pop punk]].  The band currently consists of vocalist [[Jeremy McKinnon]], rhythm guitarist Neil Westfall, percussionist/drummer Alex Shelnutt and lead guitarist Kevin Skaff.

Signing with [[Indianola Records]] for their first album, ''[[And Their Name Was Treason]]'' (2005), Scruggs was replaced by Shelnutt in 2006. Later that year the band recorded ''[[For Those Who Have Heart]]'' (2007) for [[Victory Records]]. They embarked on several tours of the UK and U.S. and played at several festivals before recording and releasing ''[[Homesick (A Day to Remember album)|Homesick]]'' (2009). While promoting ''Homesick'' on tour, Denney was replaced by Skaff. Soon after releasing their next album, ''[[What Separates Me from You]]'' (2010), the band went on a [[What Separates Me from You Tour|worldwide tour]] to promote it. Since 2011, the band has been involved in a lawsuit with [[Victory Records]] over their recording contract. In October 2013 the band was given the right to self-release new albums until a final verdict is reached. They released their fifth album, ''[[Common Courtesy (album)|Common Courtesy]]'', that month. In 2016, the band released their sixth album, ''[[Bad Vibrations]]''. They released their seventh album ''[[You're Welcome (A Day to Remember album)|You're Welcome]]'' on March 5, 2021, which marked their first release under [[Fueled by Ramen]].

Woodard said, "A friend of mine said he had the AIM screenname of someone at [[Victory Records]]. I didn't believe him, but I still started communicating with the guy.
