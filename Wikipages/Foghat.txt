'''Foghat''' is an American-based English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in London in 1971.<ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=foghat-p4289/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Foghat Billboard Singles|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://umdmusic.com/default.asp?Lang=English&Chart=D&ChDay=&ChMonth=&ChYear=&ChBand=foghat&ChSong=|title=Ultimate Music Database|website=Umdmusic.com|access-date=10 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=foghat-p4289/charts-awards|pure_url=yes}}|title=Foghat Billboard Albums|website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=14 January 2012}}</ref> The band is known for the use of electric [[slide guitar]] in its music.<ref name=RS>{{cite web|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/foghats-rod-price-dies-20050324|title=Foghat's Rod Price Dies.

==History==
===1970s===
The band initially featured [[Dave Peverett]] ("Lonesome Dave") on guitar and vocals, [[Tony Stevens]] on bass and [[Roger Earl]] on drums, after all three musicians left [[Savoy Brown]] in 1971.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> [[Rod Price]], on guitar/slide guitar, joined after he left [[Black Cat Bones]] in December 1970. The new line-up was named "Foghat" (a nonsense word from a Scrabble-like game played by Peverett and his brother<ref>{{cite web |url=http://foghat.com/ |title=The Official Foghat Website|website=Foghat.com |access-date=18 December 2013}}</ref>) in January 1971. There is a cartoon drawing on the back cover of the group's first album of a head wearing a foghat. 

Foghat relocated to the United States after signing a deal with [[Bearsville Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/foghat-mn0000201297/biography |title=Foghat Artist Biography at Allmusic|website=[[AllMusic]] |last=Earlwine |first=Stephen Thomas |access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref> Its debut album, ''[[Foghat (1972 album)|Foghat]]'' (1972), was produced by [[Dave Edmunds]] and featured a cover of [[Willie Dixon]]'s "[[I Just Want to Make Love to You]]",<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which received considerable airplay, especially on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations. The album also included a remake of Savoy Brown's bluesy ode to the road "Leavin' Again (Again!)", and "Sarah Lee", a classic blues burner featuring Price's slide guitar solo. The band's second [[Foghat (1973 album)|self-titled album]] went gold. It was also known as ''Rock and Roll'' for its cover photo of a rock and a bread roll. ''[[Energized]]'' (1974) came out, followed by ''[[Rock and Roll Outlaws]]'' (1974) and ''[[Fool for the City]]'' (1975). In 1975, Stevens left the band due to its relentless touring schedule and was temporarily replaced by producer [[Nick Jameson]] for the recording of ''[[Fool for the City]]''. During the next year, Jameson was replaced by [[Craig MacGregor]], and the group released ''[[Night Shift (album)|Night Shift]]'' (1976), a [[Foghat Live|live album]] (1977) and ''[[Stone Blue]]'' (1978), each attaining gold status in record sales. ''Fool for the City'' spawned the hit single "[[Slow Ride]]" (which reached No. 20 in the United States and No. 14 in Canada), but the greatest sales figures were reached by ''[[Foghat Live]]'',<ref name="LarkinGE"/> which went double platinum.<ref name=NYT/> More hits followed: "Drivin' Wheel", "I Just Want to Make Love to You" (from the live album), "Stone Blue" and "Third Time Lucky (First Time I Was a Fool)". Price left the band in November 1980, unhappy with the group's still constant touring and the shift away from the hard boogie sound toward a more [[New wave music|new wave]]-influenced pop direction. By February 1981, after months of auditions, he was replaced by [[Erik Cartwright]].<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=886}}</ref>

===1980s===
After 1978, Foghat's record sales began to slip, and its last album for the Bearsville label, ''[[Zig-Zag Walk]]'' (1983), only briefly touched the charts at number 192. MacGregor quit in 1982, and Jameson returned to play on ''[[In the Mood for Something Rude]]'' and ''Zig Zag Walk'' before being replaced by [[Kenny Aaronson]] (1983) and then Rob Alter (1983-1984). MacGregor returned in 1984.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The band briefly disbanded in 1984 after Peverett left and returned to England.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> Earl, along with MacGregor and Cartwright, reformed with a new singer/guitarist, Eric (E.J.) Burgeson, and continued touring as Foghat into the early 1990s. MacGregor (1986-1987, 1991), Cartwright's brother Brett Cartwright (1987, 1988-1989) and Jeff Howell (1987-1988, 1989-1991) alternated on bass during that period, while Phil Nudelman (1989-1990) and Billy Davis (1990-1993) took over for Burgeson. Dave Crigger joined on bass in 1991-1993.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===1990s===
Peverett had returned to the United States by 1990 and formed his own version of the band, Lonesome Dave's Foghat, which featured [[Bryan Bassett]] (ex-[[Wild Cherry (band)|Wild Cherry]]), Stephen Dees (bass) and Eddie Zyne (drums). Dees and Zyne had played with [[Hall & Oates]], among others. Former [[Molly Hatchet]] bassist Riff West replaced Dees in 1991, and Price made several guest appearances.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

In 1993, the original line-up reunited at the urging of producer [[Rick Rubin]]. Although Rubin ultimately proved to be unavailable to produce their comeback project, the group went ahead and released a studio album titled ''[[Return of the Boogie Men]]'' (1994) and the ''Road Cases'' live album (1998). Its final album of the decade, ''King Biscuit Flower Hour'' (taken from the syndicated radio show [[King Biscuit Flower Hour|of the same name]]), was released in May 1999 and consisted of live recordings from 1974 and 1976.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

After being back together for six years, the original line-up once again ended after Price decided to retire from touring for good. Bassett (who had been playing with [[Molly Hatchet]]), from Lonesome Dave's Foghat, was brought in on guitar.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===2000s===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Craig MacGregor and Charlie Huhn.jpg|thumb|right|Craig MacGregor (left) and Charlie Huhn (right) performing with Foghat]] -->
The 2000s saw the deaths of founding members Peverett and Price. Peverett died on 7 February 2000, aged 56, from complications from kidney cancer.<ref name=NYT>{{cite news|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Dave Peverett, 56, of the Rock Band Foghat|agency=Associated Press|date=14 February 2000|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/14/arts/dave-peverett-56-of-the-rock-band-foghat.html}}</ref>

[[Charlie Huhn]] (formerly of [[Humble Pie]], [[Ted Nugent]], and [[Victory (band)|Victory]]) was brought in to replace him on lead vocals and guitar. This line-up of Earl, Stevens, Bassett, Huhn and Steve "ih" Farrell on backing vocals and hand percussion recorded the album ''[[Family Joules]]'' (2003).<ref>{{cite web|title=Foghat Exclusive Interview with Charlie Huhn|url=http://www.travellersintime.com/UniversalWheels/charliehuhn.html|website=Travellersintime.com}}</ref>

Price died on 22 March 2005, aged 57, due to a fall resulting from a heart attack.<ref name=RS/> Later that year, original bassist Stevens left the band and was replaced by former bassist MacGregor.<ref name="foghat1">{{cite web |url=http://www.foghat.net/meettheband.htm |title=The Official Website of Foghat! |website=Foghat.net |access-date=21 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228080016/http://www.foghat.net/meettheband.htm |archive-date=28 February 2014 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===2010s===
The 2010 version of Foghat consisted of Earl, MacGregor, Huhn and Bassett. Former [[Rainbow (English band)|Rainbow]] and [[Black Sabbath]] drummer [[Bobby Rondinelli]] had temporarily replaced Earl for a summer 2010 concert, while Earl was recovering from surgery. At another Foghat concert that summer, after Earl had returned to the band, bassist Jeff Howell temporarily replaced an ill MacGregor. Foghat's next album, ''[[Last Train Home (album)|Last Train Home]]'' (released 15 June 2010), was the culmination of a dream shared by Earl and Peverett. It contained some of their favorite blues songs, three originals ("Born for the Road", "Last Train Home" and "495 Boogie"), and two songs by special guest performer and longtime friend [[Eddie Kirkland]], who was 86 years old at the time. He had played with Foghat as a guest in 1977 at Foghat's "Tribute to the Blues" show at New York City's [[Palladium (New York City)|Palladium]], and remained a good friend of the band until he was killed in a car accident on 27 February 2011.

Also performing on ''Last Train Home'' were Howell (bass), Colin Earl (piano) and Lefty Lefkowitz (harmonica). According to Earl, the album was "a testimony to Lonesome Dave. We always planned to do this. I am so fortunate to have partners in band members Charlie Huhn and Bryan Bassett who share the same passion for the blues. It was not hard work putting this album together; playing this kind of music is joyous. We had a blast!"<ref name="foghat1"/>

The band released a DVD in December 2013 called ''Live in St. Pete''.

On 10 November 2015, Foghat announced that they would start work on a new studio album, completely fan-funded through [[PledgeMusic]]. The album, titled ''[[Under the Influence (Foghat album)|Under the Influence]]'', was released on 24 June 2016. The album went on to chart of Billboard and debuted at No. 17 on Billboard's Hard Rock Albums, and peaked at No. 40 on the Independent Album charts.<ref>{{cite news|last=BraveWords|url=http://bravewords.com/news/foghat-score-big-on-billboard-charts-with-under-the-influence-album|title=FOGHAT Score Big On Billboard Charts With Under The Influence Album|website=Bravewords.com|access-date=2020-03-26|language=en-US}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/foghat/chart-history/independent-albums/song/979924|title=Foghat|website=Billboard.com|access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

The band went on to release another live album, ''Live at the Belly Up'' in June of 2017. On 9 July 2017, Erik Cartwright, who played lead guitar from 1981 to 1984, died at his home in Nashville, Tennessee, from a heart attack. He was 66 years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45spaces.com/sadly-gone-but-not-forgotten/r.php?r=9-july-2017-aged-66|title=Gone But Not Forgotten; Erik Cartwright|website=45spaces.com|access-date=6 April 2020}}</ref>

Longtime bassist MacGregor was diagnosed with stage IV [[lung cancer]] in 2015. The cancer was first detected at an earlier stage in 2012, but MacGregor was not informed until 2015. Following this incident, he became a proponent of a bill that would require physicians to communicate test results with patients promptly. Although still officially a member of Foghat, the effects of [[chemotherapy]] made him unable to play music; former [[Pat Travers]] bassist Rodney O'Quinn filled in for him on tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2016-06-20/news/73881396_1_advanced-lung-cancer-test-results-diagnostic-errors |title=Archives |website=Articles.philly.com |access-date=22 July 2017}}</ref> MacGregor died on 9 February 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/craig-macgregor-dies/|title=Foghat Bassist Craig MacGregor Dies|last=Lifton|first=Dave|website=Ultimateclassicrock.com |access-date=2020-03-26}}</ref>

Matt Barranti substituted on guitar for Bryan Bassett for a gig at Palace Theater in [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania]] on 11 February 2017.{{citation needed|date=May 2021}}
