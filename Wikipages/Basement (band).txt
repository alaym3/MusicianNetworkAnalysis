==History==
Basement formed in September 2009 in [[Ipswich]], [[England]], following the break-up of [[pop punk]] band In This for Fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/42576/interviews-basement|title=Interviews: Basement|website=Punknews.org|access-date=5 October 2018}}</ref> In This for Fun released ''The Away from Home EP'' before they broke-up.
