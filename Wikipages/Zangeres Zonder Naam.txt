'''Maria (Mary) Servaes-Beij''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmeːri sɛrˈvaːs}}; [[Leiden]], 5 August 1919 – [[Horn, Netherlands]], 23 October 1998) was a Dutch [[levenslied]] singer. She performed under the stage name '''Zangeres Zonder Naam''' (English: Singer without a name). She recorded almost 600 songs over the course of her career.<ref name=Gab>{{cite web |url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/dossier-archief/zangeres-zonder-naam-overleden-aan-hartstilstand~a469035/ |title=Zangeres Zonder Naam overleden aan hartstilstand |work=[[De Volkskrant]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://resources.huygens.knaw.nl/bwn1880-2000/lemmata/bwn6/beij |title=Beij, Maria (1919-1998) |publisher=[[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] |first1=A.J.C.M. |last1=Gabriëls}}</ref>

Servaes-Beij cared about the poor and disadvantaged, and often performed in prisons and hospitals. She was regularly in direct contact with her public, and received many emotional letters.<ref name=Gab /> The Zangeres Zonder Naam was one of the artists who performed at the Dutch ''Miami Nightmare'' concert (Amsterdam, 8 October 1977). This evening was directed against [[Anita Bryant]] and her anti-gay movement, and the Zangeres Zonder Naam performed her own song ''Luister Anita'' ("Anita, listen to me"), in which she compared Bryant with [[Hitler]].<ref name=Gab />
