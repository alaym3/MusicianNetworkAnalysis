'''Tryo''' ({{IPA-fr|tʁijo|pron}}) is a French-language 'unplugged' ska acoustic band, popular in Europe and Quebec, with three French guitarists, a percussionist, and a producer: Guizmo, Christophe Mali, Manu Eveno, Daniel "Danielito" Bravo and Bibou.

Tryo are popular in France partly due to their politically charged lyrics, whilst also showing a fun side with a range of humorous songs, especially in live performances.

They take a left wing stance, criticising various French politicians such as [[Charles Pasqua]] (named in corruption scandals concerning suburban low cost housing or [[HLM]]) and [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] and world leaders ([[George W. Bush]], for example) in their music. The band has a "tolerant" view on [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], demonstrated by "La Main Verte" from the ''[[Mamagubida]]'' album. Drug references are reduced in their later albums.

They have sold 900,000 albums. They had their 10-year anniversary in 2005, followed by a nationwide tour. Tryo have four studio albums, a double CD live album and two live DVDs.

Band members were also active in independent work. Christophe Mali released a solo album ''Je vous emmène'' in April 2006. Guitarist and songwriter Guizmo was part of the band Pause.

In August 2012 they released new album called ''Ladilafé'', a tribute to Patricia Bonnetaud who died in February 2012. This is the first album featuring DJ Catman.

He grew up in [[Cachan]] in an [[HLM]] for low income families. He started performing as a 14-year-old, leaving school after high school. With Manu Eveno, whom he met in 1989 when he was 17, they both formed part of '''M'Panada''', a reggae rock and funk group, for almost 5 years. The band split up in 1994. With Emmanuel "Manu" Eveno and Christophe Mali, he took part in the musical comedy ''Histoire de piano'' written by Christophe Mali and Maïa Rubinstein. This was the beginning for the eventual formation of Tryo.

Besides Tryo, Guizmo was active in the music collective ''Desert Rebel'', a joint cultural project launched by Tuareg guitarist [[Abdallah Oumbadougou]]. Desert Rebel made a tour of Niger.

'''Christophe Mali''' known as Mali, singer, composer, musician (guitar, accordion, piano, melodica) for Tryo, real name Christophe Petit, was born in [[Antony, Hauts-de-Seine]] on 25 August 1976. He was named Mali by Slavic fellow actors he worked with at the beginning of his career as Petit, his family name translates to 'Mali' in Serbo-Croat languages.

As a young kid, he was passionate about theatre, and improvisation in particular. He became part of the Antony-based theatre group Firmin Gémier, and later in theatre group Zarina Khan where he notably played Raskolnikov in a French adaptation of ''[[Crime and Punishment]]'' (in French ''Crime et Châtiment'' written by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. Christophe Mali himself wrote a number of theatre pieces and 'mis en scène' of musical comedies, in which he would also act and play music for.

He studied for a bachelor's degree (licence) in Philosophy and Sociology, but cut short his education to concentrate in acting and music.

He co-wrote the musical comedy ''Histoire de piano'' with Maïa Rubinstein. He offered roles for Emmanuel "Manu" Eveno and for Cyril Célestin (Guizmo) to act in it. This was the beginning for the eventual formation of Tryo in 1995, a 5-piece band that included Mali, Manu and Guizmo in addition to Daniel Bravo (Danielito) and Sebastien Pujol (Bibou). Mali was a singer, guitar, accordion and piano player for Tryo.

Christophe Mali has also developed since 2004 a solo musical career and was involved in several projects.

Influenced by Thomas Fersen, [[Jacques Higelin]] and others, he wrote about more intimate and profound subject as different from the reggae and festive air of Tryo materials. He also wrote for other artists like Jean Guidoni, Olivia Ruiz, Marina (of [[Star Academy]]) and [[Lambert Wilson]] amongst others. He also cooperated for a show with Gérald Dahan. He has also been a music consultant for [[Francofolies de La Rochelle]]. In 2011, he engaged in ''mise en scène'' in a show at Boulevard des Airs.
