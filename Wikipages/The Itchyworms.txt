'''The Itchyworms''' is a Filipino rock band composed of Jazz Nicolas on drums, Jugs Jugueta on guitars, Kelvin Yu on bass guitars and Chino Singson on lead guitars. The group made their name in the [[Music of the Philippines|OPM]] (Original Pilipino Music) scene in 2006 with their sophomore effort ''Noontime Show'' with songs such as "Akin Ka Na Lang" and "Beer".

==Members==

* Jazz Nicolas – lead vocals, drums, piano, keyboards, keytar (1996–present) 
* Jugs Jugueta – lead vocals, rhythm guitar, percussion, keyboards (1996–present)
* Kelvin Yu – bass guitar, backing vocals (1997–present); lead guitar (1996-1997)
* Chino Singson – lead guitar, backing vocals (1997–present)

===Former member===

*Haji Cruz – bass guitar, backing vocals (1996–1997)

==History==
===Early years===
Formed in 1996, the band consisted of Jazz Nicolas, Jugs Jugueta, Kelvin Yu (then on lead guitar) and Hadrian "Haji" Cruz (then on bass). The band performed at various school-based events and competitions with a handful of original songs and [[Beatles]] covers. Unfortunately, communication and scheduling issues forced Cruz to leave the group. This predicament forced Yu to take up the bass guitar vacancy, effectively making the band a trio.

The group continued as a trio until the middle of 1997, when a common friend in the Ateneo Musicians' Pool recruited Chino Singson to play guitar with the group at a school event. Singson eventually went on to become a permanent member, which solidified the group's current lineup.

In 1998 the band put together ''Revenge of the Unsigned'', their first official CD. They did this with the help of their manager Earnest Mangulabnan-Zabala, [[Eraserheads]], [[Ely Buendia]], [[Buddy Zabala]] and Romel "Sancho" Sanchez (Loquy, [[Cynthia Alexander]]). The band intended for ''Revenge'' to be their independently released debut album in the event that no major record label would sign them.

As luck would have it, then-A&R manager at Viva/Neo Records Mike Dizon (Teeth, [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]]) got hold of ''Revenge''. He helped push for Viva executives to sign the band and eventually release ''Little Monsters Under Your Bed''.

''Little Monsters'', the band's first major-label album, was released in 2001 and contained songs from ''Revenge'' plus new compositions by Nicolas and Jugueta. The song "Antipara" was probably the most well-known song on the album. The release of the album was somewhat ill-timed as its glossy pop-rock sound was an aberration in the [[Korn]]-influenced OPM Rock landscape of the late 1990s to early 2000s.

===''Noontime Show'' (2005)===
In 2005, the Itchyworms released ''Noontime Show'', which gave them modest national success and industry recognition. Buddy Zabala and [[Raimund Marasigan]], by this time both ''former'' Eraserheads, co-produced the album with the group.

Most notably, the album went on to become Album of the Year at the 2006 [[NU Rock Awards]], with Nicolas winning Drummer of the Year and the group winning Producer of the Year jointly with Marasigan and Zabala.

===Commercial performances===
The song "Akin Ka Na Lang" has been used by [[KFC]] and [[Close-Up]] in separate television advertisements. In 2008, [[Pringles]] used "Salapi" for a nationwide campaign/songwriting contest. In addition [[Enervon]], Close-Up and [[San Miguel Beer]] have also commissioned the band to write original songs for their advertising campaigns.

The band also wrote and performed "Kabataang Pinoy", the theme song for the first season of [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]]'s [[Pinoy Big Brother: Teen Edition]]. This is arguably the band's most widely publicized song because of the series' popularity and media exposure. They also performed the station ID "Para Sa 'yo Kapatid" of [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5]].

=== Recent achievements ===
In early 2016, songwriter Davey Langit asked the band to interpret "Dalawang Letra", his entry into the [[Himig Handog#Himig Handog P-Pop Love Songs (2016)|Himig Handog P-Pop Love Songs]] competition. The song won top prize at the finals night in April 2016. In July 2016, the band’s drummer/vocalist Jazz Nicolas with songwriting partner Wally Acolola, won the PhilPop grand prize with their composition "Di Na Muli", also performed by the Itchyworms.

In August of the same year, the band released "Pariwara", a song written in collaboration with Ely Buendia. According to Buendia, the song had been in his chest of unfinished ideas since the days of the Eraserheads. The song remained unused until early 2016, when vocalist Jugs Jugueta asked after any partial songs Buendia may have had lying around. Buendia gave the Itchyworms "Pariwara", and Jugueta and Jazz Nicolas delivered more lyrics and a new bridge. Ely and the Itchyworms then got together at his home studio, known as the Bunker, to hash out a final arrangement.

==Influences==
Although the individual members of the band draw on distinct influences, their common affection for [[The Beatles]] and [[Eraserheads]] heavily defines the quartet's musical sound.

==Discography==
To date the Itchyworms have released five full-length [[studio albums]] and one [[Extended play|EP]]. They have also contributed songs to numerous compilations, most notably including the ''Kami nAPO Muna'' tribute albums. In 2014 they launched their fourth full-length studio album, ''After All This Time''. This new deluxe edition of the album contains six bonus tracks aside from the ten main tracks. These include the current single ''Ayokong Tumanda'', the title track ''After All This Time'', and a remake of the classic Juan dela Cruz song "Panahon".
