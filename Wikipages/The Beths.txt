==History==
Elizabeth Stokes (vocals/guitar) and Jonathan Pearce (guitar/vocals) originally met in high school, and met both Benjamin Sinclair (bass/vocals) and Ivan Luketina-Johnston (drums) when all four attended classes at the [[University of Auckland]], studying jazz. Prior to The Beths, Luketina-Johnston was performing [[swing music|swing]] under the moniker of Sal Valentine. Stokes, Pearce and Sinclair were all a part of his backing band, The Babyshakes, for various tenures.<ref name=NZMusician-WarmBlood-2018>{{cite news|last1=Hollywood|first1=Michael|title=The Beths: Warm Blood EP|url=https://nzmusician.co.nz/music/beths-warm-blood-ep/|work=NZ Musician|accessdate=12 November 2018}}</ref><ref name=Bandcamp-Babyshakes-2013>{{cite web|title=Sal Valentine and the Babyshakes|url=https://salvalentine.bandcamp.com/album/sal-valentine-and-the-babyshakes|work=Sal Valentine|via=[[Bandcamp]]|date=17 October 2013}}</ref>
