== Career ==
Rosen began his professional career as a swing musician for the bass, guitar, and percussion tracks of ''13''.<ref name="NYTimes" /> Starting in 2012,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/nick-blaemire-caissie-levy-santino-fontana-and-more-set-for-charlie-rosens-broadway-big-band-nyc-debut-concert-com-199694|title=Nick Blaemire, Caissie Levy, Santino Fontana and More Set for Charlie Rosen's Broadway Big Band NYC Debut Concert|last=Gioia|first=Michael|date=November 12, 2012|website=Playbill|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=December 1, 2019}}</ref> he was the bandleader of Charlie Rosen's Broadway Big Band, where he arranged classic musical theater numbers into music that could be performed by a jazz orchestra with Broadway performers as the vocalists.<ref name="big band" /> {{As of|2019|April}}, he primarily features as a guitarist in the Broadway musical ''[[Be More Chill (musical)|Be More Chill]]''.<ref name="NYTimes" />

Rosen can play about 70 [[musical instrument]]s including the "[[flugelbone]]", [[melodica]], [[Fender Rhodes]], and [[theremin]].<ref name="NYTimes" /> Of these he has described the flugelbone as his "orchestrating secret weapon" due to its ability to utilize variety of [[timbre]]s.
