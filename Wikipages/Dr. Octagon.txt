'''Dr. Octagon''' is a [[persona]] created and used by [[United States|American]] [[rapping|rapper]] Keith Matthew Thornton, better known as [[Kool Keith]]. First appearing on Thornton's 1996 debut [[solo album]], ''[[Dr. Octagonecologyst]]''. The album examines the impersonal/delusional/authoritarian aspects of institutions/bureaucracies using the general hospital and psych ward as main metaphor. 
The hyper-love of new technologies is also a theme. Thornton performed and released two albums under the alias. The character was murdered by Dr. Dooom on Thornton's 1999 album ''[[First Come, First Served]]'', and was briefly revived before once again being killed on Thornton's 2008 album ''[[Dr. Dooom 2]]'', in response to the release of ''[[The Return of Dr. Octagon]]'', an album largely produced without Thornton's involvement. Kool Keith reunited with [[Dan the Automator]] and [[DJ Qbert]] to release ''[[Moosebumps: An Exploration Into Modern Day Horripilation]]'' on April 6, 2018.<ref name="MoosebumpsRelease2018">{{cite web|last1=Mojica|first1=Nick|title=Dr. Octagon Drop New Album 'Moosebumps'|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/04/dr-octagon-moosebumps-album/|website=xxlmag.co|access-date=17 April 2018}}</ref>

== Biography ==

Dr. Octagon is an extraterrestrial surgeon from Jupiter who uses space technology and primitive tools to perform medical procedures on his patients, some of whom die as he conducts his rounds, while others are murdered by his careless, barbaric acts. Octagon also practices as an orthopedic gynecologist and seduces and engages in sexual intercourse with his female patients and nurses.

Octagon, who dubs himself the "paramedic fetus of the east," is from the church of the operating room and was born on the planet Jupiter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allthelyrics.com/lyrics/dr_octagon/blue_flowers-lyrics-135199.html|title=Dr. Octagon – Blue Flowers lyrics}}</ref> His physical features include having yellow eyes, green and silver skin which also changes to blue and brown, a pink-and-white Afro, and a brain that glows yellow, black, red, green, and purple.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/ishiphopdeadpast00hess_0/page/75/mode/2up|isbn=9780275994617|title=Is hip-hop dead?|year=2007|publisher=Praeger}}</ref> Octagon also states that he can change his face with the press of a button, disappear, and wears a 7XL which has not yet been invented, X Ray sunglasses, hard shoes with razor blades, and a white suit and stethoscope.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Dr-octagon-blue-flowers-lyrics|title = Dr. Octagon – Blue Flowers}}</ref>

Octagon specifies a few of the services he offers, such as treatment of chimpanzee acne and moosebumps, and performs rectal rebuilding surgery and relocates saliva glands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dr-octagonecologyst-mw0000647337|title=Dr. Octagonecologyst - Dr. Octagon &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic}}</ref> Octagon also performs medical experiments at night when the moon is out. Proclaiming that his hammer is dull and his drill is broken, Dr. Octagon tells patients that he doesn't have tools. Instead, he states that he'll rip out a stomach, dissect open rectums, put needles in kneecaps, apply Clorox to vocal boxes, and watch his patients vomit green.<ref>https://www.lyrics.com/lyric/1510035/Dr.+Octagon/Waiting+List</ref> Dr. Octagon's office number is 1-800-pp51-doodoo, and his patients often wait in a waiting room for long periods of time before he dismisses the ones that have been waiting since morning. Octagon's hospital also houses mental patients that dance in the halls. Octagon has fed green fly soup to his patients on occasion, and has given patients a mixture of Pepsi cola, Pepto-Bismol, bugs, and pop rocks to watch them cough until they turn blue. One of Octagon's patients dies in room number 105 with cirrhosis of the eye while there is a horse loose in the hospital. Another patient is taken by Dr. Octagon out of the bathroom into water to touch the submerged electric wires. Octagon claims to hide the dead bodies of his patients in Beverly Hills, CA.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Dr-octagon-waiting-list-dj-shadow-automator-mix-lyrics|title = Dr. Octagon (Ft. DJ Shadow) – Waiting List (DJ Shadow/Automator Mix)}}</ref> Octagon's 208-year-old uncle, Mr. Gerbik, is described as being half shark, having the skin of an alligator, and carrying a dead walrus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Dr-octagon-halfsharkalligatorhalfman-lyrics|title = Dr. Octagon – Halfsharkalligatorhalfman}}</ref>

According to Kool Keith's "R.I.P. Dr. Octagon", Dr. Dooom stabbed Dr. Octagon over 17 times after he'd come back to life from being drowned under water. Multiple music critics and record producers made attempts to keep him alive, but Dooom returned to finally kill Octagon by electrocuting him with an electric razor.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dr-octagonecologyst-mw0000647337|title=Dr. Octagonecologyst - Dr. Octagon &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits &#124; AllMusic}}</ref> However, Kool Keith has continued to make appearances as Dr. Octagon. 

== History ==
The earliest instance of Thornton's Dr. Octagon character appears on the unreleased [[Ultramagnetic MCs|Ultramagnetic MC's]] demo "Smoking Dust", recorded in 1993 and  included in the 1994 compilation album [[The Basement Tapes 1984–1990|The Basement Tapes 1984-1990]]. On this demo, Thornton refers to himself as "Doctor Oc" and raps in a deeper cadence, with lyrics that intertwine grotesque pornographic imagery with science-fiction.<ref>{{Citation|title=Ultramagnetic MC's – Smoking Dust|url=https://genius.com/Ultramagnetic-mcs-smoking-dust-lyrics|language=en|access-date=2020-08-28}}</ref>

Thornton and KutMasta Kurt recorded two songs under the alias Dr. Octagon, "Dr. Octagon" and "Technical Difficulties."<ref name="Downs">{{cite news|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/PrintFriendly?oid=291467|title=''Kool Keith CD Scam Exposed''|last=Downs|first=David|date=September 27, 2006|newspaper=[[East Bay Express]]|access-date=25 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227142441/http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/PrintFriendly?oid=291467|archive-date=27 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Thornton mailed the songs to radio stations as a teaser, as well as giving copies to several [[Disc jockey|DJ]]s, as well as producer [[Dan the Automator|Dan "The Automator" Nakamura]], resulting in the production of ''Dr. Octagonecologyst''.<ref name="Downs" /> The album was recorded in Automator's studio in the basement of his parents' San Francisco home.<ref>{{cite book|title=Check the Technique: Volume 2: More Liner Notes for Hip-Hop Junkies|last1=Coleman|first1=Brian|publisher=Wax Facts Press}}</ref> ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'' featured the work of [[Turntablism|turntablist]] [[DJ Qbert]] and additional production by [[KutMasta Kurt]]. An instrumental version of the album was released under the title ''[[Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats)]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r261341/review|pure_url=yes}}|title=Review of ''The Instrumentalyst (Octagon Beats)''|last=McLeod|first=Kembrew|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref> KutMasta Kurt later pursued legal action against Automator because Kurt's demos had initiated the project. Kurt told the AV Club, “I got the whole [Dr. Octagon] thing started and really got nothing directly out of it. [Automator] ran with it, but he never gave credit to the person who threw the ball. At the end of the day, I actually had to sue the guy."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/kool-keith-and-kutmasta-kurt-14335|title=Kool Keith and KutMasta Kurt|last1=David|first1=Downs|website=The A.V.

In promotion of the album, Thornton toured under the Dr. Octagon billing. These performances featured a full live band, an on-stage breakdancer and appearances by [[Invisibl Skratch Piklz]].<ref name="Synthesis">{{cite news|url=http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-340/1997-05-30-kool_keith_gets_freaky_as_dr_octagon|title=Kool Keith gets freaky as Dr. Octagon|date=May 30, 1997|access-date=27 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011202047/http://www.synthesis.net/music/interview/item-340/1997-05-30-kool_keith_gets_freaky_as_dr_octagon|archive-date=October 11, 2008|url-status=dead|publisher=[[Synthesis (magazine)|Synthesis]]}}</ref> Nakamura has referred to Dr. Octagon as a three-person group rather than an alias of Thornton,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/music/dashed_hoop_dreams/Content?oid=291777|title=''Dashed Hoop Dreams''|last=Downs|first=David|date=October 25, 2006|newspaper=[[East Bay Express]]|access-date=25 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227142618/http://www.eastbayexpress.com/music/dashed_hoop_dreams/Content?oid=291777|archive-date=27 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> and these claims were reported by the press.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/12679957.html?dids=12679957:12679957&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&date=Jun+27%2C+1997&author=Greg+Kot.&pub=Chicago+Tribune&desc=BACK+TO+THE+FUTURE++DR.+OCTAGON+LOOKS+TO+PAST+TO+CURE+HIP-HOP&pqatl=google|title=''Back to the Future: Dr. Octagon looks to the past to cure hip-hop''|last=Kot|first=Greg|date=June 27, 1997|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|access-date=27 January 2009}}</ref>

Thornton later expressed some frustration with the "Dr. Octagon" nickname, saying, "Octagon wasn't my life...I've done a lot of things that were totally around different things other than Octagon. Are some people just afraid to venture off into my life and see that I do other things which are great? I think people stuck me with something."<ref name="AVClub">{{cite news|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/kool-keith-and-kutmasta-kurt,14335/|title=Kool Keith and KutMasta Kurt|last=Downs|first=David|date=November 21, 2008|newspaper=[[The A.V. Club]]|access-date=2009-01-27}}</ref>

In 2002, Thornton announced ''The Resurrection of Dr. Octagon'', a proposed sequel to ''Dr. Octagonecologyst'', that would reintroduce the character.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1453279/20020405/kool_keith.jhtml?headlines=true|title=All The Voices In Kool Keith's Head Working On New Albums|last=Goodman|first=Abbey|date=April 5, 2002|access-date=13 December 2008|publisher=[[MTV News]]}}</ref>
[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-based producer Fanatik J was chosen to create the music for the album.<ref name="Downs" /> Thornton himself took part in the production of early material for the project, playing [[bass guitar|bass]], [[guitar]], and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] on many of the tracks.<ref name="Moayeri">{{cite magazine|last=Moayeri|first=Lily|date=July 23, 2002|title=''Kool Keith Revives Dr. Octagon''|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolkeith/articles/story/5934820/kool_keith_revives_dr_octagon|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=25 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222143655/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolkeith/articles/story/5934820/kool_keith_revives_dr_octagon|archive-date=22 February 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After shopping around demos for the proposed album, Thornton signed a contract with [[CMH Records]] to release the album.<ref name="Downs" />
On July 23, 2002, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' reported that a new Dr. Octagon album would be released in February 2003.<ref name="Moayeri" /> As production on the album was underway, Thornton had a falling out with Fanatik J over contract rights, and the One-Watt Sun production team was hired to create the album's music.<ref name="Downs" /> After completing three vocal tracks with the label, based upon rough sonic themes created by the production team, Thornton had a falling out with the label, and gave the label recordings he had made two years previously, consisting of Thornton rapping and goofing off, in order to complete his contract. The resulting album, ''The Return of Dr. Octagon'', was largely produced without Thornton's involvement, and did not resemble the direction Thornton had initially intended for the album.<ref name="Downs" />

Promotional materials, including [[music video]]s, were produced without Thornton's involvement. Thornton states that he was "shocked" by the label's misrepresentation.<ref name="Downs" /> Following the release of the album, Thornton performed under the Dr. Octagon billing, but did not promote the album.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/25/AR2006082501297.html|title=''Kool Keith's Bits & Pieces''|last=Godfrey|first=Sarah|date=August 26, 2006|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|access-date=19 January 2009|page=C08}}</ref> ''[[Dr. Dooom 2]]'', Thornton's 2008 follow-up to ''First Come, First Served'', was produced in response to ''The Return of Dr. Octagon''.<ref name="AVClub" /> In the music video for "R.I.P. Dr. Octagon", the appearance of Dr. Octagon resembles the character design used in promotional materials by [[CMH Records]].<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMeOrWuOtBI|title=R.I.P.

In 2013, Dr. Octagon made a guest appearance on the [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs]] song "Buried Alive", which was featured on their album ''[[Mosquito (Yeah Yeah Yeahs album)|Mosquito]]''.

Once again performing as Dr. Octagon, [[Kool Keith]] reunited with [[Dan The Automator]] and [[DJ Qbert]] to release ''[[Moosebumps: An Exploration Into Modern Day Horripilation]]'' on Bulk Recordings.<ref name="MoosebumpsRelease2018" /> The album was released on streaming services on April 6, 2018,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2018/02/dr-octagon-moosebumps-album-drops-octagon-octagon/|title=DR.
