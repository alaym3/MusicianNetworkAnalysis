'''Ashanti Shequoiya Douglas''' (born October 13, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, and actress. She was first discovered as a teenager and later signed to [[Murder Inc. Records]] in 2002.<ref name=":0" /> That year, she was featured on [[Fat Joe]]'s "[[What's Luv?]]" and [[Ja Rule]]'s "[[Always on Time]]", both of which became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. She became the first female artist to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart simultaneously with "[[Foolish (Ashanti song)|Foolish]]" and "What's Luv?" at numbers one and two, respectively.

In 2002, Ashanti released her [[Ashanti (album)|eponymous debut album]], which sold over 505,000 copies throughout the U.S. in its first week of release. The album earned her many awards, including eight [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], two [[American Music Awards]], and a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 for [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]]. The album has since been certified [[triple platinum]] in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide by the end of 2003.<ref name=":3" /> The lead single for the album, "[[Foolish (Ashanti song)|Foolish]]", was a critical and commercial success; it reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. With "Foolish", she became the second artist (after [[The Beatles]]) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti wrote and sang for [[Jennifer Lopez]]'s "[[Ain't It Funny (Murder Remix)]]", which also reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="Ashanti Biography">[https://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_rewind.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Singles&y=5 "Billboard Chart Rewind"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216232357/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_rewind.jsp?f=The+Billboard+Hot+100&g=Singles&y=5|date=December 16, 2005}}</ref>

In 2003, Ashanti released her second album, ''[[Chapter II (Ashanti album)|Chapter II]]'', which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with first-week sales of 326,000 copies in the U.S. The album went [[Platinum record|platinum]], selling over 1.5&nbsp;million copies in U.S. since its release.<ref name=":1" /> The album's singles, "[[Rock wit U (Awww Baby)]]" and "[[Rain on Me (Ashanti song)|Rain on Me]]", were both commercial successes, peaking at number two and number seven on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, respectively. ''Chapter II'' was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Contemporary R&B Album, and "Rock wit U (Awww Baby)" and "Rain on Me" were each nominated in the categories of Best R&B Song and Best Female R&B Vocal Performance. In November 2003, Ashanti released a [[Christmas album]] titled ''[[Ashanti's Christmas]]'', which was a modest commercial success.

In 2004, Ashanti released her third studio album, ''[[Concrete Rose]]'', the title of which took on [[Tupac Shakur]]'s pseudonym "The Rose That Grew from Concrete". The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and became her third platinum certified album. The first single, "[[Only U]]", reached number thirteen on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad "[[Don't Let Them]]", garnered little chart success after [[Def Jam]] refused to fund a music video due to [[Irv Gotti]]'s legal troubles during his [[Irv Gotti#Money laundering indictment and acquittal|money laundering trial]].<ref name="Wilson 2005">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/27/arts/music/hiphop-producer-surrenders-in-moneylaundering-case.html|title=Hip-Hop Producer Surrenders in Money-Laundering Case|last1=Wilson|first1=Michael|date=2005|work=The New York Times|access-date=December 1, 2017|last2=Leeds|first2=Jeff|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Her subsequent albums, including ''[[The Declaration]]'' (2008) and ''[[Braveheart (Ashanti album)|Braveheart]]'' (2014), the latter of which was released independently, were less successful.

== Career ==

=== 2001–2003: ''Ashanti'', ''Chapter II'' and ''Ashanti's Christmas'' ===
Ashanti was first noticed by [[Irv Gotti]] because of her vocal skills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-252802-bio--Ashanti |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 14, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114174234/http://music.yahoo.com/ar-252802-bio--Ashanti |archive-date=January 14, 2009 }}</ref> He asked her to pen hooks for his rap artists and to perform with them in duets. Ashanti provided the melodic response to their call. Ashanti was first featured as a background vocalist on rapper [[Big Pun]]'s song "How We Roll". In the same year, Ashanti was featured on fellow labelmate Cadillac Tah's singles "Pov City Anthem" and "Just Like a Thug". She also appeared on the 2001 ''[[The Fast and the Furious (2001 film)|The Fast and the Furious]]'' soundtrack as a featured artist on Vita's 2001 [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] remake of [[Madonna]]'s "[[Justify My Love]]" and on the solo track "When a Man Does Wrong". She was featured on [[Fat Joe]]'s "[[What's Luv?]]" and Ja Rule's "[[Always on Time]]". "What's Luv?" and "Always on Time" were released simultaneously and became two of the biggest hit songs of 2002. Ashanti became the first female to occupy the top two positions on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart simultaneously when "Always on Time" and "What's Luv?" were at numbers one and two, respectively.

Following the success of her collaborations with Ja Rule and Fat Joe, Ashanti released her debut single, "[[Foolish (Ashanti song)|Foolish]]", which contains a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of the 1983 song "[[Stay with Me (DeBarge song)|Stay with Me]]" by [[DeBarge]] (also used by [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] in his 1995 single "[[One More Chance (Notorious B.I.G. song)|One More Chance]]", and by [[Big L]] in "MVP"). This is her biggest success to date, spending ten weeks atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. She became the second artist (after [[The Beatles]]) to have their first three chart entries in the top ten of the Hot 100 simultaneously. Ashanti's self-titled debut album, ''[[Ashanti (album)|Ashanti]]'', was released on [[Irv Gotti]]'s [[The Inc. Records|Murder Inc.]] record label in April 2002. It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. The album has been certified [[triple platinum]] in the United States and sold six million copies worldwide.<ref name=":3">{{cite news| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZBTBt33l_BEC&q=Ashanti%3A+answers+critics+%26+doubters&pg=PA154 | title=Ashanti: answers critics & doubters | first=Lynn | last=Norment | date= March 2005 | access-date=July 26, 2014| work=Ebony}}</ref> Ashanti wrote the album's twelve tracks, most of which were written on the spot in the studio. Ashanti's follow-up singles, "[[Happy (Ashanti song)|Happy]]" and "[[Baby (Ashanti song)|Baby]]", were not as successful as her debut single but peaked inside the top ten and top twenty in the U.S., respectively. Ashanti's debut album earned her many awards, including eight [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], two [[American Music Awards]], and a [[Grammy Award]] in 2003 for [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]]. Ashanti was the first artist to win [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]] before the category was last awarded in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vibe.com/2017/02/59-rare-facts-the-grammys/the-54th-annual-grammy-awards-show-2/|title=Vibe|access-date=February 13, 2017|date=February 7, 2017}}</ref> She was nominated as Best New Artist and "Foolish" was nominated in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category. She also received a Comet Award and two Soul Train Music Awards that same year.

Ashanti became the subject of controversy when it was announced that she would receive the Soul Train Aretha Franklin Award for "Entertainer of the Year", a high school student took offense and started an on-line petition against her, explaining to ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' that she was too new to deserve the award.

[[File:Ashanti Camp Hansen Japan tour 2005 2.JPEG|alt=|thumb|180px|Ashanti in 2005]]
Before ''Concrete Rose'' was released, Ashanti did some major promotion for her single "[[Only U]]", when she premiered it at the [[Vibe (magazine)|2004 Vibe Music Awards]]. She featured on "[[Wonderful (Ja Rule song)|Wonderful]]"—with [[Ja Rule]] and [[R. Kelly]]—that year, which peaked at number five in the U.S. and at number one in the UK.

The album debuted at number seven in the U.S., with first-week sales of 254,000 copies, and eventually became her third platinum certified album. The first single, "Only U", reached number thirteen on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and became her biggest hit in the United Kingdom, peaking at number two. A second single, the ballad "[[Don't Let Them]]", garnered little chart success after [[Def Jam]] refused to fund a music video due to Irv Gotti's legal troubles during his [[Irv Gotti#Money laundering indictment and acquittal|money laundering trial]].<ref name="Wilson 2005" /> The single was released only in the U.S., where it failed to chart, and the UK, where it reached the lower end of the top forty. After the release of ''Concrete Rose'', Ashanti released the DVD ''[[Ashanti The Making Of A Star DVD|Ashanti: The Making of a Star]]'', which was available only for a limited time. The deluxe DVD includes exclusive photo and video shoot footage, music from the albums ''Ashanti'', ''Chapter II'' and ''Concrete Rose'', special concert footage, unreleased childhood school performances and behind-the-scenes interviews with family, friends, and fans.

In 2005, Ashanti focused more on her acting career, making her feature film acting debut in the film ''[[Coach Carter]]'' alongside [[Samuel L.
