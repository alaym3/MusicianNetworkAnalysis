'''Vant''' (stylised as '''VANT''') are a British [[indie rock]] band formed in 2014 by frontman and songwriter Mattie Vant. In 2015 Vant signed to [[Parlophone Records]].<ref name="Parlophone Records Artists" /> The band announced an "indefinite hiatus" in 2017 to take effect at the end of their "Last Days of Punk" tour during November. The band released a new song ''propaganda machine'' in December 2018 and teased new music in 2019.<ref name="propaganda machine">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wearevant/photos/a.698184280248298/2021005031299543/?type=3&theater|title=vant - 03.12.18|website=Facebook.com|access-date=5 December 2018}}</ref>

==Background==
The band came together in [[London]], while Mattie was working at Dalston venue, Birthdays.<ref name="Mattie Vant interview with Counteract Magazine">{{cite web|url=http://counteract-magazine.com/2015/04/07/exclusive-interview-vant/|title=Counteract - Birmingham's Online Music Magazine - Music news and reviews from the West Midlands|work=Counteract - Birmingham's Online Music Magazine}}</ref> Originally from Seaham, Mattie has played in various bands, formulating the style for Vant while living in Brighton.<ref name="DIY Profile of Vant">{{cite web|url=http://diymag.com/2015/08/12/turn-it-up-the-no-nonsense-bolshiness-of-vant|title=Turn it up: The no-nonsense bolshiness of Vant|website=Diymag.com|access-date=22 September 2017}}</ref>

A lot of Vant's lyrical themes deal with political issues, with Mattie citing inspiration from global issues; "My concerns are worldwide things. It's not strictly centred around the UK - it's wars, global conflict, global warming".<ref name="DIY Profile of Vant" /> With this philosophy, Vant prefer to refer to their origin as 'Planet Earth' - rather than associate with a particular nationality. Of this issue, Mattie says "I don't believe in borders, I was born on Planet Earth".<ref name="Indie-Pendant Interview With Mattie Vant">{{cite news|url=http://the-indie-pendent.com/interview-vant/|title=Interview: Vant|author=Emmie Morris|newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> This is evidenced in the lyrics to "Birth Certificate".<ref name="Vant - Birth Certificate (Demo) on YouTube">{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OE-20blzZ_E|title=Vant - BIRTH CERTIFICATE (DEMO)|date=25 March 2015|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

On 18 November 2018, exactly a year after the band's last show, a video was posted on the band's social media pages of lead singer Mattie as well as their profile pictures being turned into a black screen and the stylization of the band's name being changed to lower case.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/wearevant/videos/253960138623889|website=Facebook.com|access-date=5 December 2018|title=Vant - 18.11.17 one year of silence and noise 18.11.18}}</ref> On 3 December those signed up to the band's mailing list were sent a link to a new song entitled "Propaganda Machine."<ref name="propaganda machine" /> The song showed the band turning away from punk rock sound of their previous music and turn towards a hip-hop/pop inspired sound. On 12 April the band released an EP called "Exoskeleton" which featured "Propaganda Machine" and the previously released single "Thank Lucifer."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.readdork.com/news/vant-exoskeleton-listen |title=VANT have debuted a new single, check out 'Exoskeleton' |website= [[Dork (magazine)|Dork]] |date=April 10, 2019 |access-date=April 13, 2019}}</ref>
