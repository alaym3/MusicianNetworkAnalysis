'''Emlyn''' was one of the seven [[cantref]]i of [[Kingdom of Dyfed|Dyfed]], an ancient district of [[Wales]], which became part of [[Deheubarth]] in around 950.  It consisted of the northern part of Dyfed bordering on the [[River Teifi]]. Its southern boundary followed the ridge of the line of hills separating the Teifi valley from the valleys of the [[River Tâf|Tâf]] and [[River Tywi|Tywi]].<ref>Richards, Melville, ''Welsh Administrative and Territorial Units'', UoW Press, 1969, p 268</ref>

==Geography==
The name derives from ''am'' (around, on both sides of) and ''glyn'' (valley), the valley in question being presumably the Cuch.<ref>Charles, B. G., ''The Placenames of Pembrokeshire'', National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, {{ISBN|0-907158-58-7}}, p 347</ref> The Cuch valley is the most prominent valley among the low foothills which lie between the [[Preseli Hills]] and [[Cambrian Mountains]], and Emlyn is essentially the region north of, and within, the gap between these landforms. As such, it was the first part of Dyfed to face invaders from [[Ceredigion]].

Its area was about {{convert|84|mi2|km2}}. It was divided by the [[Afon Cych|River Cuch]] into the [[cwmwd|commotes]] of [[Cilgerran (hundred)|Emlyn Is Cuch]] (to the west) and [[Emlyn Uwch Cuch]] to the east. Its civil headquarters were divided between [[Cilgerran]] in the lower commote and [[Newcastle Emlyn]] in the upper. Its ecclesiastical centre (and perhaps, in the Age of the Saints, the seat of a bishop<ref>Williams, A. H., ''An Introduction to the History of Wales'': Volume I: ''Prehistoric Times to 1063'', UoWP, 1941, pp 120-121</ref>) was the church of St Llawddog at [[Cenarth]].

==History==
===Arnulf===
Following the [[Norman Conquest of England]], the ruler of [[Deheubarth]], [[Rhys ap Tewdwr]], accepted the suzerainty of the English king, [[William the Conqueror]], but when William died, Rhys, taking the view that his vassalage was for William's life only, attacked [[Worcester, England|Worcester]] ([[Rebellion of 1088|in alliance with other magnates]]).<ref>''The history of Wales, descriptive of the government, wars, manners, religion, laws, druids, bards, pedigrees and language of the ancient Britons and modern Welsh, and of the remaining antiquities of the principality'', John Jones, 1824, London, p. 63-64</ref> Rhys was subsequently killed in battle at Brecon, in 1093, and his land (in theory forfeit for rebelling against Norman suzerainty<ref name="EBLaw">''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'', 1771, Edinburgh, volume 2, p.907, paragraph 23.</ref>) was almost immediately seized by various Norman magnates.

Sweeping south from [[Kingdom of Ceredigion|Ceredigion]],<ref>''Campaigns of the Norman Conquest'', Matthew Bennett, [[Routledge]], 2014, p. 65</ref> [[Arnulf de Montgomery]] took the lands between the [[Preseli Hills]] and [[Cambrian Mountains]] - Emlyn - and, passing south through them, conquered western Dyfed beyond it, establishing the [[Marcher Lord]]ship of [[Pembroke Castle|Pembroke]] in its place. With lands elsewhere, Arnulf appointed [[Gerald of Windsor]] as castellan; in about 1100, this castellan constructed [[Cilgerran Castle]], to counter challenges from Ceredigion, and control the cantref of Emlyn. That same year, the king{{mdash}}[[William Rufus]]{{mdash}}died.

The following year, Arnulf took part in an unsuccessful rebellion (led by [[Robert of Bellême, 3rd Earl of Shrewsbury|his elder brother]]) against William's successor, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], in aid of [[Robert Curthose]]'s claim to the throne.<ref>C. Warren Hollister, 'The Anglo-Norman Civil War: 1101', ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 88, No. 347 (Apr. 1973), pp. 317–8</ref> As a rebel against Henry's suzerainty, his lands were forfeit.<ref name="EBLaw" /> The king kept the lands for himself, but unlike other areas of the Lordship of Pembroke, there was never a large scale settlement of [[Flanders|Flemings]] in Emlyn; it remained mostly [[Welsh language|Welsh]] speaking, as it continues today.

===Clare===
When [[The Anarchy]] broke out upon Henry's death, one of the rival claimants to the throne{{mdash}}[[Stephen of England|Stephen]]{{mdash}}in need of allies, gave the Marcher Lordship to [[Gilbert de Clare, 1st Earl of Pembroke|Gilbert de Clare]] (a magnate with interests nearby), and to it attached the title [[Earl of Pembroke]]. The Anarchy also provided an opportunity for Rhys ap Tewdwr's son, [[Gruffydd ap Rhys|Gruffydd]], and his sons to raise an army and begin to reconstruct Deheubarth; starting with Ceredigion, by the 1150s they had reached as far south as [[Carmarthen]]. Though Stephen's successor, [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] launched a successful counter-attack, the situation was reversed by an uprising a few years later; Cilgerran Castle fell to Gruffydd's son, [[Rhys ap Gruffydd]], in 1166.<ref name=Turvey>''The Lord Rhys: Prince of Deheubarth'', R. Turvey, 1997, Gomer, p. 48–49.</ref>

By now, Gilbert de Clare's son, [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Richard]], had inherited the Lordship of Pembroke, now reduced to just [[Roose Hundred|Roose]] and [[Cantref of Penfro|Penfro]]. He had also inherited the Kingdom of [[Laigin]] (in [[jure uxoris]], at least according to English inheritance law); King Henry, concerned about the possibility of a Norman kingdom in Ireland not ruled by him, made peace with Rhys, appointing him [[Justiciar]] of all Deheubarth.<ref name=Turvey />

===Marshall===

However, when Rhys died, a violent succession dispute broke out between [[Maelgwn ap Rhys|his eldest son]] and [[Gruffydd ap Rhys II|his eldest legitimate son]], leading to the former attacking Cilgerran, and capturing it from the latter. Eventually the dispute completely fractured their authority, and Richard de Clare's son-in-law, [[William Marshal, 1st Earl of Pembroke|William Marshal]] was able to recover the Lordship of Pembroke entirely, his power reaching Cilgerran in 1204.<ref>[[John Edward Lloyd]], ''A History of Wales from the Earliest Times to the Edwardian Conquest'', London, 1911, volume 2, p.619</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Llywelyn Fawr]], prince of [[Gwynedd]] took the opportunity to establish his hegemony over the Welsh princes. [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] was not in a position to resist this, owing to troubles with his barons, and his own young age, until a stroke paralysed Llywelyn in 1237, and the birth of Henry's son [[Edward I of England|Edward]] two years later put the King in a much stronger political position with the nobility. In 1240, Henry managed to get Welsh princes to agree to the [[Treaty of Gloucester]], and Llywelyn Fawr died shortly thereafter. That same year, in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty, the princes of Deheubarth surrendered the lands they held, and were re-granted them as [[Honour (feudal barony)|honours]];<ref name="griff">''The Principality of Wales in the Later Middle Ages: The Structure and Personnel of Government, South Wales 1277'', Ralph A. Griffiths, 1972, Cardiff</ref><ref name="ludlow">''Carmarthen Castle: The Archaeology of Government'', Neil Ludlow, 2007, p. 21-22</ref> the king kept the Marcher Lordship of the land, while the princes became mere barons.<ref name="ludlow" /><ref name="griff" />

King Henry also ordered [[Gilbert Marshal, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Gilbert]], William Marshal's son and successor, to hand over "a reasonable portion" of his lands to the king so that one of Rhys's grandsons, [[Maredudd ap Rhys|Maredudd ap Rhys Gryg]], could be enfeoffed with it; Maredudd and Gilbert's mothers were distant relations, and before Maredudd had reached adulthood, he had been Gilbert's ward.<ref name="Dryslwyn" /> To satisfy the king's demand, Gilbert gave Maredudd the section of Emlyn east of the Cuch - Emlyn Uwch Cych ({{lang-en|Emlyn beyond the Cuch}}).<ref>''History of Carmarthenshire'', [[John Edward Lloyd]], Cardiff, 1935, volume 1</ref> Early the following year, in a marriage that had probably been pre-arranged, Maredudd married Isobel, the illegitimate daughter of Gilbert's elder (but now deceased) brother, [[William Marshal, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|William]];<ref name="Dryslwyn">''Excavations at Dryslwyn Castle 1980-1995'', Chris Caple, 2007, p.</ref> he had effectively acquired Emlyn Uwch Cych as a dowry. Maredudd built a castle to control his part of Emlyn: [[Newcastle Emlyn Castle|Newcastle Emlyn]].

===The introduction of counties===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2019}}
In 1282, the [[Statute of Rhuddlan]] converted the king's lands into counties, with those enfeoffed to Maredudd (including Emlyn Uwch Cych) becoming the main part of [[Carmarthenshire]]. Carmarthenshire was administratively subdivided into a number of [[Hundred (county division)|hundreds]], with Emlyn Uwch Cych falling within [[Elvet (hundred)|Elvet Hundred]]. Maredudd's son, [[Rhys ap Maredudd]] had by now inherited Maredudd's baronies, which continued to exist{{mdash}}though now within Carmarthenshire{{mdash}}until Rhys committed treason in 1287, attempting a rebellion.

The part of Emlyn west of the Cuch{{mdash}}Emlyn Is Cych ({{lang-en|Emlyn on this side of the Cuch}}){{mdash}}remained part of the Marcher Lordship of Pembroke, which continued to be held by William Marshall's descendants until 1389, when [[John Hastings, 3rd Earl of Pembroke|the then Marcher Lord]] died without direct or male-line heirs; as a result, the territory defaulted to the crown. Decades later, the Marcher Lordship of Pembroke was transferred to a royal favourite, who then likewise died without legitimate children, causing it to revert once more to the crown, a pattern that would repeat itself throughout the 15th century; among others it was held by [[Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester|Duke Humphrey (of Gloucester)]], [[William de la Pole, 1st Duke of Suffolk|William de la Pole]] and [[Jasper Tudor]].

The last gifting of the Marcher Lordship of Pembroke, now attached to the title of Marquess, was from [[Henry VIII of England|King Henry VIII]] to [[Anne Boleyn]] (shortly before he married her); later, at around the time she was on trial for treason, the king passed the first [[Laws in Wales Act]] in 1535, which abolished the status of Marcher Lords, and converted the Marcher Lordship of Pembroke, together with [[Dewisland]], into [[Pembrokeshire]]. Emlyn Is Cych became Pembrokeshire's [[Cilgerran Hundred]].

Emlyn's name lives on in several local place names, including Newcastle Emlyn.
