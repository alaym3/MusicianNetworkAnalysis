==Group origins==

===''Celebrate the Nun'' (1985–92)===
At the end of 1985, [[H. P. Baxxter]] and [[Rick J. Jordan]] met in [[Hanover]], Germany through a [[Classified advertising|small ad]] and founded the [[synthpop]]/[[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Celebrate the Nun]]. While the lead vocals were performed by Baxxter and female vocals were delivered by Baxxter's sister Britt Maxime, Rick J. Jordan took care of the keyboards and sound engineering.<ref name="Thesecondfuture.net: Celebrate the Nun">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesecondfuture.net/de/projekte/ctn/celebratethenun.html|title=Thesecondfuture.net: Celebrate the Nun|publisher=thesecondfuture.net|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref> The band released their first album ''Meanwhile'' in 1989. [[AllMusic]] wrote that "During the mid-'80s, numerous synth pop acts dreamed of becoming the next [[Depeche Mode]]. Celebrate the Nun could have been buried in the glut of Depeche Mode doppelgangers; however, top-drawer songwriting and consistently catchy hooks lifted Celebrate the Nun above the mass of wannabes".<ref name="All music: Celebrate the Nun">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=celebrate-the-nun-p12521/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=All music: Celebrate the Nun|website=[[allmusic]]|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref> The single "[[Will You Be There (Celebrate The Nun song)|Will You Be There]]" off ''Meanwhile'' peaked at No. 5 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Dance/Club play chart on 23 June 1990, whereas the single "[[She's a Secretary]]/Strange" peaked at No. 12 on Dance/Club play chart on 8 December of the same year.<ref name="Billboard.com: Celebrate the Nun"/> Slin Tompson, who was the fourth person in the band's original line-up, left the band in 1990 to start a project on his own.<ref name="Thesecondfuture.net: Celebrate the Nun"/> In 1991, the band released their second album ''Continuous'', but this was less successful due to synthpop's declining popularity.<ref name="All music: Celebrate the Nun"/> Two singles were released off the second material, "Patience" and "You Make Me Wonder" both of which went without charting. Not finding the expected success in the New Wave arena, Baxxter kept working at the former Hamburg based Indie label (currently [[Edel Records]]) in the Distribution and Sales department where he met Scooter's future manager Jens Thele.<ref name="Musicline.de: Scooter Biography">{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/artist/scooter/morefacts|title=Musicline.de: Scooter Biography |publisher=Musicline.de|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref>

===''The Loop'' (1993–98)===
Soon afterwards, in late 1993, the former Celebrate the Nun members under the management of Jens Thele formed a remix team known as The Loop. The Loop became one of the top remix teams in Germany, releasing remixes for artists like [[Adeva]], [[Holly Johnson]], The Tag Team and [[RuPaul]].<ref name="Musicline.de: Scooter Biography"/><ref name="Scootertechno.com: Scooter Biography">{{cite web|url=http://www.scootertechno.com/gb-1-2-4-4-Biography.html|title=Scootertechno.com: Scooter Biography|publisher=Scootertechno.com|access-date=2 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103040950/http://www.scootertechno.com/gb-1-2-4-4-Biography.html|archive-date=3 November 2010}}</ref>

===The First Chapter (December 1993–98)===
Scooter started as a project in December 1993. Their debut single was a cover of [[Chocolate Puma|René et Gaston]]'s "Vallée De Larmes" (French for ''Valley of Tears'') and reached No.8 on the German official dance chart. In April 1994, Scooter played their first live show at "The Palladium" in Hamburg.

At first, "[[Hyper Hyper]]" was expected to be a small hit within the club scene, but it managed to reach the No.2 position on the German single chart, [[Media Control Charts|Media Control]], eventually going triple gold for selling 750,000 units.<ref name="Musicline.de: Scooter Biography"/><ref name="Scooter's German Certifications">{{cite certification|region=Germany|artist=Scooter|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref> "Hyper Hyper" also entered the top-5 in Switzerland, Austria and in Italy, meanwhile, entering the top-10 in the Netherlands and Norway.<ref name="I singoli più venduti del 1994

The band maintained the initial technique of their sound throughout their second album, ''Our Happy Hardcore'', until the style became noticeably different with their 1996 single "[[I'm Raving]]" (from the third album ''Wicked'') as the tempos were down to 138 [[Beats per minute|BPM]] from their previous tempos which were between the range of 160 and 190 BPM. The single reached No.4 in Germany and earned a gold certification for selling well over 250,000 units.<ref name="Scooter's German Certifications"/>

Scooter's fourth album, ''[[Age of Love (album)|Age of Love]]'', which reached the No.19 slot on Germany's Media Control album chart was the last album that featured Baxxter's cousin Ferris Bueller.<ref name="Musicline.de: Scooter Biography"/><ref name="Scooter's album positions in Germany">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.de/ersuche.asp?kategorie=chart&interpret_suche=scooter&titel_suche=&jahr=&cat=a|title=Charts.de: Scooter (albums)|publisher=Charts.de|work=[[Media Control Charts|Media Control]]|access-date=2012-09-07}}</ref>

[[Image:Scooter in Moscow 2000.jpg|thumb|Scooter circa 2000. Left to right: [[H.P. Baxxter]], [[Rick J. Jordan]], Axel Coon.]]
In 1998, Ferris Bueller (Soren Buehler) left the group to pursue a solo career (he later admitted that he had been suffering from [[Depression (mood)|depression]] for several years due to his then new time-demanding life as a pop star), and was replaced by DJ Axel Coon, who had been working with the band at the recording studio for some time already. Coon had also played live with Scooter in some occasions, covering for Rick J. Jordan. In June 1998, Scooter released one of their most popular singles to date "How Much Is the Fish?" which peaked at No.3 in Germany, the single also went gold selling over 250,000 units in Germany alone.<ref name="Scooter's German Certifications"/><ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany">{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.de/ersuche.asp?kategorie=chart&interpret_suche=Scooter&titel_suche=&jahr=&cat=s|title=Charts.de: Scooter (singles)|publisher=charts.de|work=[[Media Control Charts|Media Control]]|access-date=7 September 2012}}</ref> Their fifth studio album, ''No Time to Chill'' reached the No.4 position on Germany's Media Control album chart, whereas it topped the album chart in Finland and earned a gold-award for sales of over 36,000 units.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/><ref name="Scooter: No Time to Chill">{{cite web |url=http://www.swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Scooter&titel=No+Time+To+Chill&cat=a|title= Scooter: No Time to Chill|publisher=Hung medien|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="Scooter's album certifications for Finland">{{cite web |url=http://www.ifpi.fi/tilastot/kultalevyt/haku/?q=Scooter&national=0&type=album|title= Tilastot: Scooter|publisher=[[IFPI]] Finland|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref> In the same vein, the album reached a gold status in Poland for sales of over 50,000 units.<ref name="Poland's Gold-award 1995-present">{{cite web|url=http://www.zpav.pl/rankingi/wyroznienia/zlote/index.php |title=Złote CD 1995–present |publisher=[[ZPAV]] |access-date=3 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721133154/http://www.zpav.pl/rankingi/wyroznienia/zlote/index.php |archive-date=21 July 2011 }}</ref>

In July 1999, Scooter released their first single "[[Faster Harder Scooter]]", from their sixth album, ''Back to the Heavyweight Jam''.

Scooter released their seventh studio album, ''Sheffield'', in May 2000.

In late 2000, after their second single "She's the Sun", Scooter were awarded a Comet at the 2000 VIVA Comet Awards in the category of "Most Successful Dance Act".

The band's 21st single, "Posse (I Need You on the Floor)" was released in Germany on 21 May 2001 and it was the first Scooter single since "Endless Summer" to include a high-pitched-voice in the chorus. The single peaked at No.7 at Scooter's home market spending 13 weeks on the official single chart.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/> Their eighth album, ''We Bring the Noise'', released in June 2001, included another single, "Aiii Shot the DJ".

[[Image:Scooter Kiev 2004.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Scooter in 2004. Left to right: [[Jay Frog]], [[H.P. Baxxter]], [[Rick J. Jordan]].]]
At the beginning of 2002, immediately after the release of trio's compilation album ''Push the Beat for this Jam'', Axel Coon left the band to pursue a solo career in DJing and remixing, and [[Jay Frog]] became the new third person. Jay Frog was already familiar with the band as he had occasionally covered for Axel Coon.

As a quick way of introducing the new member Frog to their fans, the trio released a second compilation album in November 2002, ''[[24 Carat Gold (album)|24 Carat Gold]]''. Scooter's 24th single, "Nessaja" was a cover version of the title track from [[Peter Maffay]]'s musical ''Tabaluga'', and debuted at No.1 on the German official single charts.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/> The single managed to reach a gold status in Germany for selling over 250,000 units.<ref name="Scooter's German Certifications"/> The single also did well in numerous markets including Austria, Norway and Denmark in all of which it entered the top-5, it also managed to enter the top-10 in Switzerland, Finland and the Netherlands.<ref name="SCOOTER: NESSAJA (SONG)">{{cite web |url=http://www.swisscharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Scooter&titel=Nessaja&cat=s|title=SCOOTER: NESSAJA (SONG)|publisher=Hung Medien|access-date=2 November 2010}}</ref>

In March 2003, Scooter released their next studio album, ''[[The Stadium Techno Experience]]''. The album climbed to No.7 on the [[Media Control Charts|Media Control]] album chart and was certified gold in Sweden, Norway and Hungary.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/><ref name="Norway's certification database"/><ref name="Sweden's certifications 2004">{{cite web|url=http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/ar-20042.pdf |title=ÅR 2004 |publisher=[[IFPI]] Sweden |access-date=3 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305012930/http://www.ifpi.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/ar-20042.pdf |archive-date=5 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Hungary's certification database">{{cite web |url=http://www.mahasz.hu/?menu=arany_es_platinalemezek&menu2=kereso|title=Mahasz: Kereso|publisher=[[Mahasz]]|access-date=3 November 2010}}</ref> The single "The Night" became the last to feature the high pitched voice effect and reached the top-10 in Germany.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/> The next single from the album, "[[Maria (I Like It Loud)]]", was released in collaboration with hardcore producers [[Marc Acardipane]] and Dick Rules, reaching No.4 on the single charts.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/>

''[[Mind the Gap (Scooter album)|Mind the Gap]]'' was Scooter's 10th studio album, which was released on 8 November 2004 in three different versions, basic, regular and deluxe. While the album peaked at No.16 at home and spent 21 weeks on the album chart, the trio's 28th single, "Shake That!" flavored with 1970s [[Disco|disco sound]] was released on 4 October 2004 in most European countries, the single entered the German Media Control single chart peaking at No.8.<ref name="Scooter's album positions in Germany"/><ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/>

Their 11th studio album, ''[[Who's Got the Last Laugh Now?]]'', featured a cover version of "[[Everlasting Love]]." The ''Who's Got The Last Laugh Now?'' 2006 tour was followed by the release of both the CD and the 2-disc DVD entitled ''Excess All Areas'', one of the DVDs containing the final Hamburg concert of the tour and the second containing every music video released so far.

===The Fourth Chapter (2006–2014)===
[[Image:Scooter in leipzig.jpg|thumb|right|Scooter on their ''[[Under the Radar Over the Top]]'' Tour, 2010]]
On 14 August 2006, it was announced that Jay Frog had decided to leave the band to pursue a solo career. Frog was replaced by [[Michael Simon (DJ)|Michael Simon]], who had remixed some of Scooter's tracks while in search of success with his "Shahin & Simon" project.<ref name="Scootertechno.com: Scooter Biography"/> On 19 August, Scooter played at the Tufertschwil Open Air in Switzerland, where Simon debuted.

The single "[[Behind the Cow]]" was premiered at ''[[The Dome (television program)|The Dome 40]]'' in [[Düsseldorf]] on 1 December 2006, and was released on 19 January 2007. The song and its lyrics are based on "[[What Time Is Love?]]" by [[The KLF]]. Their 12th album ''[[The Ultimate Aural Orgasm]]'', which includes the songs "The United Vibe" (cover version of [[Den Harrow]]'s "Catch the Fox"), "Scarborough Affair" or "The Shit That Killed Elvis" (collaboration with [[Jimmy Pop]], the frontman of American fun-rock-band The [[Bloodhound Gang]]), was released on 9 February 2007. The album peaked at No.6 in Germany and spent 16 weeks on the album chart.<ref name="Scooter's album positions in Germany"/> The second single released off ''The Ultimate Aural Orgasm'' was "[[Lass uns tanzen]]" which appeared in stores on 23 March. Despite the fact that the single peaked only at No.19 at home, it managed to stay on the singles chart for 18 weeks.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/>

On 10 August, Scooter released a new single called "[[The Question Is What Is the Question?]]", the release of which surprised many of their fans as they were expecting a third single from the current album rather than an entirely new material. The single peaked at No.5 on the singles charts with overall of 26 weeks on the charts.<ref name="Scooter's singles positions in Germany"/> That was a record as none of Scooter's previously released singles had so far remained that long within the singles charts. The band released a [[jumpstyle]] cover version of classic 1970s track "[[How Do You Do (Mouth & MacNeal song)|How Do You Do]]" by [[Mouth & MacNeal]].

During the summer of 2009, Scooter announced the release of their next studio album, ''[[Under the Radar Over the Top]]''. On 14 August 2009, Scooter released "[[J'adore Hardcore]]", the first single from ''Under the Radar Over the Top''. "J'adore Hardcore" was based on Planet Funk's "Chase the Sun" and The Pitcher's "I Just Can't Stop". On 30 July 2009, during the video shoot for "J'adore Hardcore", Baxxter was almost a victim of a [[2009 Palma Nova bombing|car bomb attack]] in [[Majorca]], Spain.<ref>{{cite web|author=Von Mark Pittelkau Und Anna Hesse |url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/unterhaltung/leute/2009/08/01/scooter-frontmann-h-p-baxxter/entging-nur-knapp-dem-bombenanschlag-auf-mallorca.html |title=Bild.de |publisher=Bild.de |access-date=19 December 2009}}</ref> Michael Simon reported that Baxxter was alright and it was a very near miss.

On 9 February 2010 it was announced that Scooter would perform the official song of the [[2010 IIHF World Championship]]. This song would be "[[Stuck on Replay]]", and it would additionally be released as the fourth single from ''Under the Radar Over the Top''.

The ''Under the Radar Over the Top'' Tour was announced before the album was released. The tour was a week long through several German cities such as [[Hamburg]], Berlin, and [[Leipzig]] and one Swiss city, [[Zurich]], throughout March 2010. This was the largest tour to date, and again featured the [[Sheffield Jumpers]]. During this tour, Scooter performed in front of a total of 40,000 people, and the Hamburg concert was the largest on the tour, with a sold-out venue of 14,000. This was followed by Leipzig, with 10,000 people attending the final concert of the tour.

A week after the tour, Scooter announced in an interview with a Russian radio station that a live DVD, CD, and [[Blu-ray]] of the Hamburg concert would be released. It was eventually announced that Scooter's fourth live DVD would be released on 7 May, called [[Live in Hamburg (Scooter album)|Live in Hamburg]].

It would tour through several German cities, such as [[Rostock]], [[Stuttgart]], and [[Dresden]].
