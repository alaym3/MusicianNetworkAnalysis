== Early life ==
Born in Sheffield, Hawley grew up with two sisters in a working-class area of the city.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":4" /> He was born with a cleft palate, which required numerous operations.<ref name=":3" /> Both his parents were musicians; his father [[Dave Hawley]] was a guitarist with a number of local bands (on his death, the ''Sheffield Star'' called him a "Sheffield music legend"),<ref>''The Sheffield Star'', Saturday 10 February 2007</ref> and his mother Lynne a singer.<ref name=":5">{{cite web|title = Obituary: Dave Hawley|url = https://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/mar/20/obituaries.mainsection|website = the Guardian|access-date = 29 September 2015|first = J. P.|last = Bean}}</ref> They divorced when he was 16 years old.<ref name=":3" /> He is a lifelong supporter of local football club [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/50856019 |title=Premier League festive predictions: Lawro v singer-songwriter and Sheffield Wednesday fan Richard Hawley |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 December 2019|access-date=30 January 2021}}</ref> He noted that "I always wrote songs since childhood" and realising that "you could actually make something up of your own was quite a big one then".<ref name=":0" /> He attended Hucklow Middle School together with future Pulp bassist  [[Steve Mackey]], and passed his [[GCE Ordinary Level|O-levels]]. Hawley briefly worked at the local [[HMV]].<ref name=":0" />

While still at school, Hawley formed the Treebound Story and at the age of 19 recorded a Peel Session together with the band.<ref name=":3" />

==Solo career==

=== Setanta (2001–2004) ===
As a member of the Longpigs, Hawley released two albums, ''[[The Sun Is Often Out]]'' and ''[[Mobile Home (album)|Mobile Home]]''. After the demise of the band, he joined Pulp as a touring guitarist while also working as a session musician.<ref name=":0" /> During his time with both bands he was able to "quietly hone" his songwriting skills, citing that "I was never really very good about bleating on about being a songwriter".<ref name=":0" /> Impressed by a home [[Demo (music)|demo]] of his songs, both Cocker and Mackey urged Hawley to record the material. He used some left-over studio time to demo material and to experiment. Pointing out that "I just wanted to make something gentle for myself – I never expected it to be released". He recorded a song per day, recording most of the instruments himself "with a boom mike in the middle so I could walk between instruments – I mixed it in my head".<ref name=":4">{{cite web|title = Time Has Made A Change: Richard Hawley on his debut album|url = http://www.qthemusic.com/6323/richard-hawley-i/|website = Qthemusic.com|access-date = 28 September 2015|date = 27 October 2014|publisher = Q Magazine|first = Richard|last = Hawley|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930000241/http://www.qthemusic.com/6323/richard-hawley-i/|archive-date = 30 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref> His eponymous debut was a mini-album that featured seven songs and released in April 2001 through [[Setanta Records]].<ref>{{cite web|title = Richard Hawley - Richard Hawley|url = http://www.discogs.com/Richard-Hawley-Richard-Hawley/release/1331841|website = Discogs|access-date = 26 September 2015}}</ref> It was supported by the single "Coming Home".<ref>{{cite web|title = Richard Hawley - Coming Home|url = http://www.discogs.com/Richard-Hawley-Coming-Home/release/1430538|website = Discogs|access-date = 26 September 2015}}</ref> While Hawley played "90% of the stuff" he was assisted by former Longpigs drummer Andy Cook and Colin Elliot, who became his long-term producer.<ref>{{cite web|title = 365 Artists {{!}} Colin Elliot|url = http://www.365artists.com/producers/colin-elliot.php#.VgaiJtJVhBc|website = 365artists.com|access-date = 26 September 2015|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150927012713/http://www.365artists.com/producers/colin-elliot.php#.VgaiJtJVhBc|archive-date = 27 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Hawley later commented that "I think with anybody's early stuff you can batter it and take things apart. [With] doing those early records I was trying to get back to a way of being creative with recording rather than taking this dogmatic approach to it". He admitted that he didn't get "it right every time but I got what I wanted to achieve. It was to try and find something in the song. And also, with those early records, there was no money".<ref name=":0" /> Clash Magazine described it as "a rather brief burst of seven mid-paced, ’50s-flecked moments of [[Jangle pop|jangle]]. Listening back now, it’s easy to spot the early signs of the grandeur that was to come, especially on standout "Sunlight" amongst these tentative 22 and a half minutes".<ref name=":2" /> The cover of the album was shot in front of a bingo hall in [[Cleethorpes]].<ref name=":0" />

In 2001, ''Late Night Final'', named after the cry of vendors selling the ''[[Sheffield Star]]'' evening newspaper on the streets of the city,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/reviews/live/richard-hawley-city-hall-sheffield-021012-111102 |title=Richard Hawley - City Hall, Sheffield 02/10/12 |publisher=The Line Of Best Fit |date=4 October 2012 |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> was released to positive reviews from the press. Hawley later explained that prior to going into the sessions "all I'd got was the riff to "Baby, You're My Light" and that the majority of songs were written during the sessions. As an example he cited "The Nights Are Cold" that was done in one take after Cooke asked "look, we've got a gig tonight, are we doing this or what?".<ref name=":0" /> Clash magazine called it "a remarkably assured, often truly gorgeous, collection of warmly evocative lullabies" singling out the songs "Baby, You’re My Light" and "The Nights Are Cold" as "mesmerising".<ref name=":2" /> The album was produced by Alan Smythe.<ref>{{cite web|title = Guest Column - Time Has Made A Change: Richard Hawley on Late Night Final|url = http://www.qthemusic.com/6335/richard-hawley-ii/|website = Qthemusic.com|access-date = 28 September 2015|date = 29 October 2014|last = Hawley|first = Richard|publisher = Q Magazine|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150930014542/http://www.qthemusic.com/6335/richard-hawley-ii/|archive-date = 30 September 2015|df = dmy-all}}</ref>

Two years later Hawley released ''[[Lowedges]]'', named after a suburb of the city.<ref name=":2" /> The ''[[NME]]'' called ''Lowedges'' the "first great album of 2003"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/richard-hawley|title=Richard Hawley Biography | location=London | work=The Guardian | date=24 November 2011}}</ref> and it topped an end-of-the-year [[opinion poll|poll]] held by [[Virgin Radio]]. Of the two albums, he later stated that "as those three records progressed you can see the band thing taking over more and more. By the time you get to ''Lowedges'' there's less of me playing everything and there's more of the guys. I was determined for it to be very ragged-arsed and not to be really polished and produced".<ref name=":0" />

=== Mute (2005–2011) ===
After leaving Setanta Records in 2004, Hawley signed to [[Mute Records]], a division of [[EMI]]. Legal wrangling delayed ''[[Coles Corner (album)|Coles Corner]]'', Hawley's third album, until September 2005.<ref name=rockfeedback /> Again, Hawley mined the theme of his home city, this time referencing the location where [[courting]] lovers meet. ''Coles Corner'' eventually gained a nomination for the [[Mercury Prize]] in 2006. [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]] of the [[Arctic Monkeys]], whose debut album won the prize, exclaimed "Someone call 999, Richard Hawley's been robbed!"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdtvpQEvK7A |title=Arctic Monkeys - Mercury Music Speech |publisher=YouTube |date=14 December 2009 |access-date=15 October 2015}}</ref>

Hawley's 2007 album ''[[Lady's Bridge (album)|Lady's Bridge]]'' (again named with a Sheffield reference,<ref>{{cite web|author=Lady's Bridge |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=sv&geocode=&q=lady's+bridge,+sheffield,+uk&ie=UTF8&ll=53.385766,-1.464137&spn=0.00206,0.005021&t=k&z=18&iwloc=addr&om=1 |title=lady's bridge, sheffield, uk - Google Maps |publisher=Maps.google.com |date=1 January 1970 |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> after a bridge in the centre of the city) was released in the United Kingdom on 20 August 2007. He performed a 16-date tour during September 2007 to promote the album. Merchandising on the tour included T-shirts and posters, but also special edition bottles of Sheffield-made [[Henderson's Relish]]. The same year, Hawley's father died after a long illness.<ref name=":5" />  Setanta re-released his self-titled debut in 2007 extending it with five additional tracks.<ref>{{cite web|title = Richard Hawley - Richard Hawley|url = http://www.discogs.com/Richard-Hawley-Richard-Hawley/release/1881125|website = Discogs|access-date = 26 September 2015}}</ref> He later commented that the release "altered the flow, there's a track on it called 'Troublesome Waters' which is a cover of a Howard Seratt song and it's the only time me and my dad featured together on a published recording. He plays rhythm guitar".<ref name=":0" />

On 14 January 2008, Hawley was nominated for his first solo [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for Best British Male Performer.<ref>[http://re.mixedinsheffield.co.uk/richard-hawley/] {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> Hawley was a headlining act at the 2008 [[Festival Internacional de Benicàssim]] in Spain. Hawley produced, with Colin Elliot, and contributed two songs to the album ''[[Made in Sheffield (album)|Made in Sheffield]]'', a compilation of songs by the Sheffield-based songwriters for [[Tony Christie]].

''[[Truelove's Gutter]]'', Hawley's fifth studio album, was released on Mute Records on 21 September 2009.  The album won the ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' record of the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.umusicpub.co.uk/en-GB/Artists/R/Richard-Hawley.aspx |title=Richard Hawley &#124; Universal Music Publishing UK |publisher=Umusicpub.co.uk |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref>

His song "Don't Get Hung Up in Your Soul" was chosen as the [[Starbucks]] [[iTunes]] Pick of the Week for 17 November 2009.<ref>{{cite web|last=Heringer |first=Mark |url=http://www.mark-heringer.com/2009/11/starbucks-itunes-pick-of-week-richard.html |title=Starbucks iTunes Pick of the Week - Richard Hawley - Don't Get Hung Up In Your Soul |publisher=Mark-heringer.com |date=17 November 2009 |access-date=1 April 2012}}</ref> and "Open Up Your Door" featured as the soundtrack song to the [[Häagen-Dazs]] ice cream TV commercial in the UK.

Hawley's track "[[Tonight The Streets Are Ours]]" was chosen as the title track for the [[83rd Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominated 2010 [[Banksy]] film ''[[Exit Through the Gift Shop]]'' which premièred at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on 24 January 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ifc.com/blogs/indie-eye/2010/01/exit-through-the-gift-shop.php |title="Exit Through The Gift Shop": It’s a madhouse, this modern life. – IFC |publisher=Ifc.com |date=27 January 2010 |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> His 2011 song "There's a Storm Coming" was used at the end of the film ''[[Brighton Rock (2010 film)|Brighton Rock]]''.

"You And I" by Richard Hawley and The Death Ramps (aka [[Arctic Monkeys]]), was released as the B-side of the Arctic Monkeys' single "Black Treacle" on 23 January 2012.

=== Parlophone (2012–2015) ===
''[[Standing at the Sky's Edge]]'', the sixth solo album, was released in the UK on 7 May 2012 through [[Parlophone]]. It was supported by the release of four singles, "Leave Your Body Behind You", "Down in the Woods", "Seek It" and "Don't Stare at the Sun".

==Session work==
Hawley has also worked with several musicians, including [[Hank Marvin]], [[A Girl Called Eddy]], and [[Jarvis Cocker]] (and his [[Relaxed Muscle]] project). He played the guitar solo on [[All Saints (group)|All Saints]]' cover version of "[[Under the Bridge / Lady Marmalade|Under the Bridge]]". On working with others, Hawley noted that he has always been asked to and he likes "working with other people because you can get too absorbed in your own little bubble".<ref name=":0" />

In 2002, Hawley produced the debut single "So Young" by Sheffield band [[Hoggboy]], co-produced the band's two albums ''Or 8?'' and ''Seven Miles Of Love'', co-wrote second album track "Hello",<ref>{{cite web|author=Alex McCann |url=http://designermagazine.tripod.com/HoggboyINT1.html |title=Hoggboy - Interview @ Designer Magazine |publisher=Designermagazine.tripod.com |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> and also played on a cover version of [[Little Walter]]'s "Come Back Baby",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hoggboy.com/news/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031227223836/http://hoggboy.com/news/ |archive-date=27 December 2003 |title=News |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=8 October 2003 |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> which was released as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to the single "Believe".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Hoggboy-Believe/release/1354500 |title=Hoggboy - Believe (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=10 May 2014}}</ref> Hawley also produced material by lead singer Tom Hogg's next band The Hosts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://richardhawley.co.uk/richards-collaborators/ |title=Richard’s Collaborators — Richard Hawley |publisher=Richardhawley.co.uk |access-date=10 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224054518/http://richardhawley.co.uk/richards-collaborators/ |archive-date=24 February 2014  }}</ref>

Praise from [[R.E.M.]]'s [[Mike Mills]] led to Hawley being approached to support the group on several concert dates in 2005. After contributing to [[Nancy Sinatra]]'s 2004 [[Nancy Sinatra (album)|self-titled album]], Hawley supported her on a European tour in 2005 and duetted with her on several of the tour's concerts.

Hawley provided vocals for "Bad Woman", a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to [[Arctic Monkeys]]' single "[[Teddy Picker]]", released on 3 December 2007. He also co-wrote and provided vocals and guitar to the song "The Fix" on [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]]'s Mercury Prize-winning 2008 album ''[[The Seldom Seen Kid]]''. Hawley also performed the song with the band at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 2008, on ''[[The Culture Show]]'' in June 2008, at Elbow's homecoming gigs in [[Manchester]] in 2008, [[Wembley Arena]] in March 2009, [[Blackpool]]'s Empress Ballroom in March 2009 and at the MEN Arena in September 2009. He reprised his collaboration with Elbow on 17 January 2009 for a special recording of ''The Seldom Seen Kid'' with the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] at [[Abbey Road Studios]], which was subsequently released as a special edition CD and DVD set titled ''[[The Seldom Seen Kid#The Seldom Seen Kid Live at Abbey Road|The Seldom Seen Kid Live at Abbey Road]]'' in March 2009. He appeared with Elbow on 19 March 2011 while the band were in Sheffield to perform "The Fix" during their UK tour.

Hawley worked again with Sheffield band [[Arctic Monkeys]] in January 2012, providing vocals for the "[[Black Treacle]]"'s [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], "You And I", which was released on 23 January that year. The band usually used the alias of the [[Death Ramps]] when working in collaboration with Hawley.

== Style ==
Hawley's inspiration has largely been found in his local Sheffield and 1960s rockabilly, he also stating that "I've only ever wanted to make music that's soulful, that has some depth and heart in it."<ref name=":0" /> From early on in his career he was "really obsessed with things like [[Chess Records]], [[Sun Records]], the [[Bihari brothers]] and those records of that time were all done in the blink of an eye and it was about capturing a moment, and there was a degree of musical alchemy in all that." ''[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]]'' magazine noted the "[[Roy Orbison|Orbison]] and [[Scott Walker (singer)|Walker]] comparisons" attributed to Hawley's early work.<ref name=":2" /> He described himself as "a jack of all trades" when commenting on his career as both a (session) musician and a songwriter, describing them as "running parallel".<ref name=":0" /> The covers and names of his albums often reference his home-town: "I know what it's like to live here in Sheffield and therefore it seems perfectly logical to write about it."<ref name=":0" />
