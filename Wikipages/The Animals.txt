'''The Animals''' (also billed as '''Eric Burdon and the Animals''') are an English [[rhythm and blues|rhythm-and-blues]] and [[rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]] in the early 1960s. The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, [[blues]]y sound and deep-voiced frontman [[Eric Burdon]], as exemplified by their [[signature song]] and transatlantic number-one hit single "[[The House of the Rising Sun#The Animals' version|The House of the Rising Sun]]" as well as by hits such as  "[[We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]", "[[It's My Life (The Animals song)|It's My Life]]", "[[Don't Bring Me Down (The Animals song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]", "[[I'm Crying]]", "[[See See Rider]]" and "[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood#The Animals version|Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]." The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm-and-blues-oriented album material and were part of the [[British Invasion]] of the US.

The Animals underwent numerous personnel changes in the mid-1960s, and suffered from poor business management, leading the original incarnation to split up in 1966. Burdon assembled a mostly new lineup of musicians under the name Eric Burdon and the Animals; the much-changed act moved to California and achieved commercial success as a [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[hard rock]] band with hits such as "[[San Franciscan Nights]]", "[[When I Was Young (song)|When I Was Young]]" and "[[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]" before disbanding at the end of the decade.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/the-animals/biography |title=The Animals Biography|magazine=Rolling Stone|year=2001 |access-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> Altogether, the group had 10 top-20 hits in both the [[UK Singles Chart]] and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

The original lineup of Burdon, [[Alan Price]], [[Chas Chandler]], [[Hilton Valentine]] and [[John Steel (drummer)|John Steel]] reunited for a one-off benefit concert in Newcastle in 1968. They later launched brief comebacks in 1975 and 1983. Several partial regroupings of the original-era members have occurred since then under various names. The Animals were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994.

===The Animals (1962–1968)===
Formed in Newcastle upon Tyne during 1962 and 1963 when Burdon joined the Alan Price Rhythm and Blues Combo, the original lineup was Burdon (vocals), Price (organ and keyboards), Hilton Valentine (guitar), John Steel (drums) and Bryan "Chas" Chandler (bass).<ref name=RHOF/><ref>[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-animals-p3555 The Animals: Biography] [[AllMusic]] Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref>

The Animals performed fiery versions of the staple [[rhythm and blues|rhythm-and-blues]] repertoire, covering songs by artists such as [[Jimmy Reed]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Nina Simone]]. Signed to [[EMI]]'s [[Columbia Graphophone Company|Columbia]] label, their first single was a rocking version of the standard "Baby Let Me Follow You Down" (retitled "[[Baby Let Me Take You Home]]").<ref>{{cite book|author1=David Hatch|author2=Stephen Millward|title=From Blues to Rock: An Analytical History of Pop Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FyO8AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA102|year=1987|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=978-0-7190-2349-1|page=102}}</ref>

In June 1964, the transatlantic number-one hit "[[The House of the Rising Sun]]" was released. Burdon's howling vocals and the dramatic arrangement, featuring Price's haunting organ riffs, created perhaps the first [[folk rock|folk-rock]] hit.<ref>Marsh, Dave  [http://www.lexjansen.com/cgi-bin/marsh_xml.php?fn=87 ''The Heart of Rock & Soul: The 1001 Greatest Singles Ever Made'', NAL, 1989.

Retrieved 4 May 2007.</ref> Debate continues{{By whom|date=October 2021}} regarding the Animals' inspiration for the arrangement, which has been variously ascribed to prior versions by [[Bob Dylan]], folk singer [[Dave Van Ronk]], blues singer [[Josh White]] (who recorded it twice in 1944 and 1949) and singer/pianist Nina Simone (who recorded it in 1962 for ''[[Nina at the Village Gate]]''). The intense arrangement is said{{By whom|date=October 2021}} to owe much to the band's desire to become the most memorable of the many acts on tour in the UK. {{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

The Animals' two-year chart career, with their songs produced by [[Mickie Most]], featured intense, gritty pop-music [[Cover song|covers]] such as [[Sam Cooke]]'s "[[Bring It On Home To Me|Bring It On Home to Me]]" and the Simone-popularised number "[[Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood]]." In contrast, their album tracks stayed with rhythm and blues, with John Lee Hooker's "[[Boom Boom (John Lee Hooker song)|Boom Boom]]" and [[Ray Charles]]' "[[I Believe to My Soul (song)|I Believe to My Soul]]" as notable examples.

In October 1964, the Animals visited New York for concert dates and an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. They were transported from the airport into Manhattan in a motorcade, chased by shrieking young female fans, consisting of [[Sunbeam Alpine]] Series IV top-down convertibles with fashion models riding along. The Animals sang "[[I'm Crying]]" and "The House of the Rising Sun" to a packed audience of hysterical girls screaming throughout both performances on Sullivan's show. In December, the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] film ''[[Get Yourself a College Girl]]'' was released, featuring the Animals and [[the Dave Clark Five]]. The Animals sang the [[Chuck Berry]] song "[[Around and Around]]" in the film.<ref>[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=2452&category=Full%20Credits Get Yourself a College Girl (1964)] Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref>

By May 1965, the group was starting to feel internal pressures. Price left because of personal and musical differences, as well as his [[fear of flying]] while on tour.<ref name="Making Time" /> He went on to a successful career as a solo artist and with [[the Alan Price Set]]. [[Mick Gallagher]] filled in for Price on keyboards for a short time until [[Dave Rowberry]] replaced Gallagher. Rowberry was on hand for the hit songs "[[We Gotta Get out of This Place|We Gotta Get Out of This Place]]" and "[[It's My Life (Animals song)|It's My Life]]."

The Animals assembled a [[big band]] to play at the fifth annual [[National Jazz and Blues Festival|British Jazz and Blues Festival]] in [[London Borough of Richmond upon Thames|Richmond]]. The Animals Big Band made their one public appearance on 5 August 1965. In addition to Burdon, Rowberry, Valentine, Chandler and Steel, the band featured a brass/horn section of [[Ian Carr]], [[Kenny Wheeler]] and Greg Brown on trumpet and [[Stan Robinson (saxophonist)|Stan Robinson]], Al Gay, [[Dick Morrissey]] and Paul Carroll on saxophone.

Many of the Animals' hits originated from [[Brill Building]] songwriters recruited by Mickie Most, but the group, and Burdon in particular, felt this to be too creatively restrictive. As 1965 ended, the group signed a new deal with their American label [[MGM Records]] for the US and Canada and switched to [[Decca Records]] for the rest of the world. They also ended their association with Most and began to work with MGM Records producer [[Tom Wilson (producer)|Tom Wilson]], who allowed them more artistic freedom.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=HCkEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA26&dq=%22animals+to+switch+to+MGM%22&hl=en&ei=_rpGTsu-CY3HsQKykO32BQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=%22animals%20to%20switch%20to%20MGM%22&f=false Animals to Switch to MGM] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' (25 Sep 1965). Retrieved 11 September 2011.</ref> In early 1966, MGM collected the band's hits on ''[[The Best of The Animals (1966 album)|The Best of The Animals]]'', and it became their best-selling album in the US. In February 1966, Steel left and was replaced by [[Barry Jenkins (musician)|Barry Jenkins]]. A leftover rendition of [[Gerry Goffin|Goffin]]–[[Carole King|King]]'s "[[Don't Bring Me Down (Animals song)|Don't Bring Me Down]]" was the group's last hit as the Animals. The next single, "[[See See Rider]]," was credited to Eric Burdon and the Animals. By September 1966, the original incarnation of the group had split up. Their last batch of recordings was released on the album ''[[Animalism (album)|Animalism]]'' in November 1966.

Burdon began work on a solo album called ''[[Eric Is Here]]'', which also featured his UK number-14 solo hit single "Help Me, Girl," which he heavily promoted on TV shows such as ''[[Ready Steady Go!]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in late 1966. ''Eric Is Here'' was Burdon's final release for Decca Records.

By this time, the Animals' business affairs "were in a total shambles" according to Chandler (who went on to manage [[Jimi Hendrix]] and produce [[Slade]]) and the group disbanded. Even by the standards of the day, when artists tended to be financially naïve, the Animals made very little money, eventually claiming mismanagement and theft on the part of their manager [[Michael Jeffery (manager)|Michael Jeffery]].<ref>Goodman, Fred (2015), ''Allen Klein: The Man Who Bailed Out the Beatles, Made the Stones, and Transformed Rock & Roll'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, New York, 978-0-547-89686-1, pp. 66–68.</ref>{{better source|reason=Goodman's 2015 biography supports mismanagement and theft by Michael Jeffrey but doesn't quote Chandler|date=January 2016}}

=== Eric Burdon and the Animals (1966–1968) ===

[[File:Animals ABKCO.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Eric Burdon and the Animals in 1967: Foreground: Eric Burdon<br>Background (L–R): Danny McCulloch, John Weider (in striped shirt), Vic Briggs, and Barry Jenkins]]

A group with Burdon, Jenkins and new sidemen [[John Weider]] (guitar/violin/bass), [[Vic Briggs]] (guitar/piano) and [[Danny McCulloch]] (bass) was formed under the name Eric Burdon and Animals (or sometimes Eric Burdon and the New Animals) in December 1966, and changed direction. The hard-driving blues sound was transformed into Burdon's version of [[psychedelia]] as the former heavy-drinking [[Geordie]] (who later said he could never get used to Newcastle "where the rain comes at you sideways") relocated to California and became a spokesman for the [[Summer of Love|Love Generation]].

Early performances by this group did not include any of the hits for which the original group had become known.<ref>T. Curtis Forbes, [http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/19670221.jpg ‘Animals’ tamed for concert here—they add a violin]. ''[[Newport Daily News]]'', 21 February 1967, via Ross Hanna and Corry Arnold (2010), [http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Eric%20Burdon.htm Eric Burdon and The Animals]. Retrieved 14 March 2017.</ref> Some of the new Animals' hits included "[[San Franciscan Nights]]," "[[Monterey (Eric Burdon and the Animals song)|Monterey]]" (a tribute to the 1967 [[Monterey Pop Festival]]) and "[[Sky Pilot (song)|Sky Pilot]]." Their sound was much heavier than that of the original group, with Burdon screaming more and louder on live versions of "[[Paint It Black]]" and "[[Hey Gyp]]." By 1968, they had developed a more [[Experimental music|experimental]] sound on songs such as "[[Lili Marlene|We Love You Lil]]" and the 19-minute "New York 1963–America 1968" from the album ''[[Every One of Us]]''.

[[Zoot Money]] was added to the lineup in April 1968, initially as organist/pianist only, but upon McCulloch's departure, he also took on bass and occasional lead vocals.

In July 1968, [[Andy Summers]] (later the guitarist for [[the Police]]) replaced Briggs. Both Money and Summers were formerly of British psychedelic outfit [[Dantalian's Chariot]], and much of this new lineup's set was composed of Dantalian's Chariot songs, which caught Burdon's interest.<ref>Summers, Andy (2006). ''One Train Later''. New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-312-35914-0}}. Page 123.</ref> Because of Money's multi-instrumental load, in live settings, bass was played alternately by Weider and Summers.<ref name="Historia">Sutcliffe, Phil & Fielder, Hugh (1981). ''L'Historia Bandido''. London and New York: Proteus Books. {{ISBN|0-906071-66-6}}. Page&nbsp;47–48.</ref>

By December 1968, this incarnation of the Animals had dissolved, but their double album ''[[Love Is (Animals album)|Love Is]]'' was released internationally, featuring the singles "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" and "[[River Deep – Mountain High]]".

Numerous reasons have been cited for the breakup, the most famous of which involved an aborted Japanese tour. The tour had been scheduled for September 1968 but was delayed until November after difficulty obtaining visas.<ref name="Historia"/> Only a few dates into the tour, the promoters (whom the band did not know were ''[[yakuza]]'') kidnapped the band's manager and threatened him at gunpoint to write an [[IOU]] for $25,000 to cover losses incurred by the tour's delay.<ref name="Historia"/> Correctly surmising that his captors could not read English, he added a note to the IOU that it was written under duress.<ref>Summers, Andy (2006). ''One Train Later''. New York: St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|978-0-312-35914-0}}. Page&nbsp;134–5.</ref> The ''yakuza'' released him, but warned that he and the band would have to leave Japan the next day or be killed. The Animals promptly fled the country, leaving all of their tour equipment behind.<ref name="Historia"/> Money and Summers each pursued solo careers, Weider signed up with [[Family (band)|Family]] and Burdon joined forces with a Latin group from [[Long Beach, California]] called [[War (U.S. band)|War]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Reunions of the Animals===
The original Animals lineup of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and reformed in late 1975 to record again.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll|date=2001|publisher=Rolling Stone Touchstone|page=22}}</ref> Burdon later said that nobody understood why they had agreed to this short reunion. They embarked on a brief tour in 1976 and shot [[Music video|videos]] for their new songs such as "[[Lonely Avenue]]" and "Please Send Me Someone to Love." They released an album in 1977 that was aptly titled ''[[Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-animals/bio/ |title=The Animals Biography &#124; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |publisher=Rockhall.com |access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time that were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed with Price and a complete lineup, foreshadowing future events.

All five original band members reunited in 1983 for the album ''[[Ark (Animals album)|Ark]]'' and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, [[Nippy Noya]] on percussion, [[Steve Gregory]] on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single, "[[The Night (Animals song)|The Night]]," reached number 48 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart. The band released a second single called "Love Is for All Time," which did not chart.

Songs performed on the ''Ark'' tour included some from the 1960s, but most were from the band's contemporary repertoire, such as "Heart Attack", "No More Elmore" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), "Oh Lucky Man" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to ''O Lucky Man!'' by Price), "It's Too Late", "Tango" and "Young Girls" (later released on Burdon's compilation album ''The Night''). Their [[Wembley Arena]] concert on 31 December 1983 (supporting the Police) was released on the ''[[Greatest Hits Live (Rip It to Shreds)|Rip it To Shreds]]'' live album in 1984 after the Animals had disbanded again. Their 29 November 1983 concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]] was released on 27 February 2008 as ''Last Live Show''. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.

Chandler died from an [[aneurysm]] in 1996, putting an end to any possibility of another reunion of the full original lineup.<ref>{{cite news|last=Welch|first=Chris|title=Obituaries: Chas Chandler|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-chas-chandler-1329256.html|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=17 July 1996|access-date=28 February 2011}}</ref>

=== Later incarnations ===

[[File:The Animals 2016.jpg|thumb|The Animals during a concert in Poland, 2016]]
During the 1990s and 2000s, several groups have called themselves the Animals in part:

*In 1993, Valentine formed the Animals II and was joined by Steel in 1994 and Rowberry in 1999. Other members of this version of the band include Steve Hutchinson, [[Steve Dawson]] and Martin Bland. From 1999 until Valentine's departure in 2001, the band toured as the Animals. This version featured Tony Liddle on lead vocals backed by Valentine, Steel, Rowberry and [[Jim Rodford]]. Chris Allen substituted for Rodford, who was busy with [[Argent (band)|Argent]], on bass and backing vocals. Steve Farrell contributed backing vocals and hand percussion.
*After Valentine left these Animals in 2001, Steel and Rowberry continued as Animals and Friends with Peter Barton, Rodford, and John E. Williamson. When Rowberry died in 2003, he was replaced by Mick Gallagher (who had briefly replaced Price in 1965). Danny Handley joined the band in 2009, initially as lead guitarist, but replaced Barton on lead vocals when Barton retired in 2012. Scott Whitley had a brief tenure in the band before Roberto "Bobby" Ruiz took over on bass. This successful lineup continues to tour the world with guests such as [[Steve Cropper]] and [[Spencer Davis]].
*In the 1990s, Danny McCulloch, from the later-1960s Animals, released several albums as the Animals.<ref>{{cite web |title=In Memoriam: Danny McCulloch – No Treble |url=https://www.notreble.com/buzz/2015/02/17/in-memoriam-danny-mcculloch/ |website=No Treble |publisher=No Treble |access-date=4 October 2018}}</ref> The albums contained covers of some original Animals songs, as well as new ones written by McCulloch.
*Burdon formed a new backing band in 1998 that was billed as Eric Burdon and the New Animals. This was actually just a renaming of an existing band with whom he had been touring in various forms since 1990. Members of this new group included Dean Restum, [[Dave Meros]], [[Neal Morse]] and [[Aynsley Dunbar]]. [[Martin Gerschwitz]] replaced Morse in 1999 after [[Ryo Okumoto]]'s brief three-week stint, and Dunbar was replaced by [[Bernie Pershey]] in 2001. In 2003, the band started touring as Eric Burdon and the Animals. After the lineup changed in 2006, original guitarist Valentine joined the group for its 2007 and 2008 tours. The group also included [[Red Young]], Paula O'Rourke and Tony Braunagle. After Burdon lost the rights to the name, he formed a new band with different musicians.
*In 2016, Burdon formed the current lineup of the Animals, including Johnzo West (guitar/vocals), Davey Allen (keys/vocals), Dustin Koester (drums/vocals), Justin Andres (bass guitar/vocals), Ruben Salinas (sax/flute) and Evan Mackey (trombone).<ref>{{cite web|title=Eric Burdon|url=http://www.ericburdon.com/#!band-1/n26of|website=Ericburdon.com|access-date=19 October 2019}}</ref>

===Dispute over ownership of band name===
In 2008, an adjudicator determined that original Animals drummer John Steel owned "the Animals" name in the UK because of a trademark registration that Steel had filed. Eric Burdon had objected to the trademark registration, arguing that he personally embodied any goodwill associated with "the Animals" name. Burdon's argument was rejected, in part because he had billed himself as "Eric Burdon and the Animals" as early as 1967, thus separating the goodwill associated with his own name from that of the band. On 9 September 2013, Burdon's appeal was allowed, and he is now permitted to use the name "the Animals."{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

===Legacy===
The original Animals were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1994, although Burdon did not attend and the band did not perform.<ref name=RHOF>[http://rockhall.com/inductees/the-animals/bio/ The Animals] [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], 1994. Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref> In 2003, the band's version of "The House of the Rising Sun" ranked number 123 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'s'' [[500 Greatest Songs of All Time]] list. Their 1965 hit single "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" was ranked number 233 on the same list. Both songs are included in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's [[the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll|500 Songs That Shaped Rock and Roll]].<ref>[http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/steveparker/halloffame.htm Rock and Roll Hall of Fame – 500 Songs That Shaped Rock] Retrieved 28 February 2011.</ref>

On 15 March 2012, in a keynote speech to an audience at the [[South by Southwest]] music festival, [[Bruce Springsteen]] discussed the Animals' influence on his music at length, stating, "To me, the Animals were a revelation. They were the first records with full-blown class consciousness that I'd ever heard." Of "We Gotta Get Out of This Place" (written by two New York songwriters, [[Barry Mann]] and [[Cynthia Weil]]), Springsteen said: "That's every song I've ever written&nbsp;... That's '[[Born to Run (song)|Born to Run]],' '[[Born in the U.S.A. (song)|Born in the U.S.A.]],' everything I've done for the past 40 years including all the new ones. That struck me so deep. It was the first time I felt I heard something come across the radio that mirrored my home life, my childhood." Saying that his album ''[[Darkness on the Edge of Town]]'' was "filled with Animals," Springsteen played the opening riffs to "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood" and his own "[[Badlands (Bruce Springsteen song)|Badlands]]" back to back, then said, "Listen up, youngsters!  This is how successful theft is accomplished!"<ref>{{cite web|last=Associated |first=The |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=148694819 |title=Springsteen Gives Music History Lesson At SXSW |publisher=NPR |date=16 March 2012 |access-date=31 March 2012}}</ref>
