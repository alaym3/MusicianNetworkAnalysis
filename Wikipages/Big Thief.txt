===''Capacity'' (2017)===
''Capacity'', the band's second album, received critical acclaim upon its release. At Metacritic, which assigns a [[Standard score|normalized]] rating out of 100 to reviews from [[music critic]]s, the album received an [[Weighted mean|average]] score of 81, indicating "universal acclaim", based on 15 reviews.<ref>{{Citation|title=Capacity by Big Thief|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/capacity/big-thief|website=Metacritic.com|accessdate=2018-01-18}}</ref>
