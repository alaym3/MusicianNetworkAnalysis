'''Reel Big Fish''' is an American [[ska punk]] band from [[Orange County, California]]. The band gained [[mainstream]] recognition in the mid-to-late 1990s, during the [[Third wave ska|third wave of ska]] with the release of the gold certified album ''[[Turn the Radio Off]]''. Soon after, the band lost mainstream recognition but gained an underground [[cult following]]. As of 2006, the band was no longer signed to a major record label and has since been independent. After numerous line-up changes, frontman Aaron Barrett is the last remaining founding member still performing in the band.

==History==
===1991–2001: Early success===
The band formed in 1991 while the members were in high school. The group started as a cover band until they released a demo in 1992, titled ''In The Good Old Days''.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} With the departure of Ben Guzman soon after, then backup vocalist Aaron Barrett took his place as lead singer. The band then changed its genre to ska.

Reel Big Fish's self-released debut album, ''[[Everything Sucks (Reel Big Fish album)|Everything Sucks]]'', was successful and became an underground hit spread by word-of-mouth, which led to the band signing a deal with [[Mojo Records]].<ref name=AllMusic>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist |id=p182515 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Reel Big Fish |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref> In August 1996, the band released the album ''[[Turn the Radio Off]]'' on the new label, which appealed to fans of ska punk style, and the band began touring throughout the United States. After the single "[[Sell Out (Reel Big Fish song)|Sell Out]]" became well known in mainstream venues, including [[MTV]], the album peaked at number 57 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts, staying on the charts for 32 weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.billboard.com/artist/reel-big-fish/155181#/artist/reel-big-fish/chart-history/155181?sort=position |title=Reel Big Fish Music News & Info &#124; Billboard.com |publisher=M.billboard.com |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref> However, the ska revival was short-lived, and the group's 1998 album ''[[Why Do They Rock So Hard?]]'' failed to match the sales of the band's previous record. In 1998, the band appeared in the movie ''[[BASEketball]]'', performing in the stands to rouse the crowd. The band also appeared on the film's [[BASEketball (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] with a cover of [[A-ha]]'s "[[Take On Me]]". ''Why Do They Rock So Hard?'' was the last album for two members of the band. Trombonist Grant Barry was fired for his conduct, culminating with him committing battery on a security guard at [[Mississippi Nights]] during a concert in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and drummer Andrew Gonzales left the band to spend more time with his family.

===2001–2006: Major label years===
Trumpet player Tavis Werts left the band in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=180600 |title=Reel Big Fish - 10.18.06 - Interview |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref> Former [[Suburban Rhythm]] drummer [[Carlos de la Garza (music producer)|Carlos de la Garza]] and former [[Spring Heeled Jack (band)|Spring Heeled Jack]] trumpeter Tyler Jones, who tracked for two songs on ''[[Cheer Up! (Reel Big Fish album)|Cheer Up!]]'' (because Werts had already recorded the majority of his trumpet parts before his departure), were brought in. De la Garza's last concert with Reel Big Fish was on June 20, 2003, at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Anaheim, California]]. That concert was later released as a DVD in ''[[The Show Must Go Off!]]'' series. Jones appeared in the music videos for "Where Have You Been?" and "Monkey Man" (although neither featured any trumpet-playing), and continued to play live with the band until September 2004. Jones was replaced by trumpeter John Christianson, who had previously played with Barrett in the band, [[The Forces of Evil]].

On April 5, 2005, the band released its fourth album on Mojo, ''[[We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy]]''. Justin Ferreira (who replaced De La Garza) was on drums for the recording, but left before the album's release to join the Orange County band [[Takota]] and subsequently is listed as an additional musician on the CD. He was replaced by Ryland Steen.

Compared to the previous album (''Cheer Up!''), which was more lighthearted and cheerful, Allmusic describes the songs in ''We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy'' as "angry" and "embittered", but also deemed the album as "super catchy". Common themes expressed throughout the songs include jealousy, regret, short-lasting fame, and disappointment toward mainstream record companies.

Aaron Barrett has stated that ''We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy'' was "the third record in a trilogy" that began with ''[[Turn the Radio Off]]''. "The first one was about being in a band and trying to make it. Then ''[[Why Do They Rock So Hard?]]'' was like, 'we've made it, we're rock stars'. ''[[Cheer Up! (Reel Big Fish album)|Cheer Up]]'' we made because we had to make it. But ''We're Not Happy 'Til You're Not Happy'' is about us being old and jaded now."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inmusicwetrust.com/articles/70h07.html |title=INTERVIEW: Reel Big Fish: Aaron Barrett discusses 15 minutes of fame, new record, and SKA's next generation |publisher=In Music We Trust |access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

===2006–present: Independent work===
While on tour in early 2006, Reel Big Fish were dropped from the [[Jive Records]] label.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shuster|first1=Fred|title=Music Writer|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/THE+BIG+FISH+THAT+GOT+AWAY+O.C.%27S+LONG-RUNNING+SKA-PUNK+ENSEMBLE...-a0157409399|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|publisher=Daily News (Los Angeles, CA)|access-date=February 20, 2015|date=Jan 12, 2007|quote="When word came in via phone from band management during a 2006 tour stop in Salt Lake City, happiness was instantly in the air. "}}</ref> The band formed its own label and released a 3-disc live performance CD/DVD set, ''[[Our Live Album Is Better Than Your Live Album]]''. This package became available on July 18, 2006, on the Internet and in retail stores on August 22. Jive later released a Reel Big Fish greatest hits album, ''[[Greatest Hit...And More]]''.

On February 20, 2007, the band released ''[[Duet All Night Long]]'', which is a split EP with power pop punk band ''[[Zolof the Rock & Roll Destroyer]]''. It features six cover songs (three from each band), with the two vocalists performing with both bands. The song, "Say Say Say" features [[Scott Klopfenstein]] on vocals in place of Barrett.

The band released its first studio album since leaving [[Jive Records]]; ''[[Monkeys for Nothin' and the Chimps for Free]]'' worldwide on July 10, 2007, on the [[Rock Ridge Music]] record label. On June 26, 2007, shortly before its release, the band announced in a Myspace blog that Matt Wong was leaving the band to spend more time with his wife and newborn child. He was replaced by Derek Gibbs who played bass in [[Jeffries Fan Club]] and Aaron Barrett's now defunct side project, [[The Forces Of Evil]]. Since Matt Wong was very popular with fans, some were skeptical of the new bassist's ability, but the band has stated that Derek Gibbs is "Matt Wong Approved" therefore extinguishing several fans' worries. Gibbs had been filling in for Wong on various tours since early 2002.

On December 19, 2007, the band announced that it would play the entire Warped Tour 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/news.asp?id=1437446 |title=Warped Tour 2007 |publisher=Warpedtour.com |access-date=July 9, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20071214232033/http://www.warpedtour.com/warpedtour/news.asp?id=1437446 |archive-date=December 14, 2007 }}</ref>
