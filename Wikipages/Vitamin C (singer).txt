===''Hairspray'' and Eve's Plum===
[[Image:EPlive.jpg|thumb|Fitzpatrick performing with Eve's Plum in 1997]]

In 1988, while a student at New York University living in the same dorm as [[Sarah Silverman]], [[John Fugelsang]] and Bridget Looney, Fitzpatrick made her screen debut under her real name in the [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]] feature film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' as Amber Von Tussle, the bratty on-screen daughter of co-stars [[Debbie Harry]] and [[Sonny Bono]].
 
She made her first musical outing as the lead singer of the [[alternative rock]] band [[Eve's Plum]], named after ''[[The Brady Bunch]]'' actress [[Eve Plumb]], formed in 1991.<ref name=twist>{{cite journal|journal=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kAgEAAAAMBAJ&q=vitamin+c+eve%27s+plum&pg=PA12|title=Elektra's Vitamin C Gives Pop a Twist|date=July 17, 1999|page=12}}</ref> She formed the band with Michael Kotch in 1991, whom she met while studying at New York University.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=vitamin c|bio=true}} Billboard bio on Vitamin C]</ref> A year later the group signed a record deal with [[Epic Records]] in 1992, releasing two albums and seven singles between 1993 and 1995 before being dropped. The band continued to perform together until 1998.

===Solo work as ''Vitamin C''===
Immediately following the group's breakup, she took interest in a dance/pop musical solo project she dubbed "Vitamin C". She shopped demos she recorded for a while and eventually signed an album deal with [[Elektra Records]] in 1998.<ref name="people.com"/>

Her debut solo album, ''[[Vitamin C (album)|Vitamin C]]'', peaked on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 29<ref>{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=vitamin c|chart=Billboard 200}} |title=Vitamin C Music News & Info |magazine=Billboard.com |access-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref> and was certified Platinum by the [[RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Vitamin%20C&format=ALBUM&go=Search&perPage=50 |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – July 14, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> The album's first single, "[[Smile (Vitamin C song)|Smile]]", climbed to number 18 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]<ref name="allmusic1"/> and was also certified Gold by the RIAA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Vitamin%20C&format=SINGLE&go=Search&perPage=25 |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – July 14, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> The second single from her album "[[Me, Myself & I (Vitamin C song)|Me, Myself & I]]", failed to chart.

In the summer of 2000, a DJ from the Republic of Ireland picked up a copy of the single while on holidays in New York.

Her cover version of the [[Frankie Valli]] and the [[The Four Seasons (group)|Four Seasons]] song "[[December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)]]" was used as a [[brand|brand image]] theme by the American television network [[The WB]] in image spots, [[Promotion (marketing)|promos]], and [[Interstitial program|interstitials]] during the 1999–2000 [[television season]]. She also recorded a song she wrote called "Vacation", which became the opening theme to the short movie ''[[Pikachu's Vacation]]'' (''[[Pokémon: The First Movie]]'').

Like many artists before her, Vitamin C took advantage of the marketing opportunities available to a pop star, licensing everything from her own doll to a shade of lipstick matching her signature orange hair. She was also turned into a video game character for a baseball game. The [[Mattel]] Vitamin C doll was a hair activity doll that came with changeable hairstyle extensions available in orange and red, the doll also came with a microphone, platform shoes, and was approximately retailed at $16.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/vitamin-c/112893#/news/billboard-bits-napster-vitamin-c-coldplay-874336.story |title=Vitamin C |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> The Vitamin C lipstick shade was made by [[Tommy Hilfiger]].<ref name=ew/> Both the doll and lipstick were available to the retail market in 2000. The 2001 video game ''[[EA Sports]] Triple Play'' featured Vitamin C as an animated baseball player, as well as her cover of [[The Waitresses]]' song "[[I Know What Boys Like]]".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vitaminc/articles/story/5932530/vitamin_c_gets_gamed |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070518205122/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/vitaminc/articles/story/5932530/vitamin_c_gets_gamed |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 18, 2007 |title=Music News: Latest and Breaking Music News |magazine=Rolling Stone |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

In late 2000, Vitamin C released "[[The Itch (Vitamin C song)|The Itch]]", the first single from her second album ''[[More (Vitamin C album)|More]]''. Though the song got some popular dance/club airplay, it stalled on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] at number 45.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/431018/vitamin+c/chart |title=Vitamin C – Chart history |magazine=Billboard |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> "The Itch" was a much bigger success in Australia for Vitamin C, where it charted at number 6 on the [[ARIA Charts]]<ref>{{cite web|first=Steffen |last=Hung |url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Vitamin+C&titel=The+Itch&cat=s |title=Vitamin C – The Itch |publisher=australian-charts.com |access-date=April 9, 2012|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325122746/http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Vitamin+C&titel=The+Itch&cat=s |archive-date=March 25, 2012 }}</ref> and was certified Platinum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-singles-2001.htm |title=ARIA Charts – Accreditations – 2001 Singles |publisher=Aria.com.au |access-date=July 14, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140205035939/http://www.aria.com.au/pages/aria-charts-accreditations-singles-2001.htm |archive-date=February 5, 2014}}</ref> The single was a minor hit in 2001 in Ireland.

The song failed to chart in the US, thus the planned third single, "I Know What Boys Like", was scrapped and Vitamin C was dropped from [[Elektra Records]]. The [[LGBT]] lifestyle magazine ''So So Gay'' dubbed ''More'' the epitome of the [[electropop]] genre.<ref name=electro>{{cite web|last=White|first=Greg|title=Lost in Music: Vitamin C – More|url=http://sosogay.co.uk/2012/lost-in-music-vitamin-c-more/|work=So So Gay|publisher=So So Gay Ltd.|access-date=December 6, 2012|date=November 22, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220192223/http://sosogay.co.uk/2012/lost-in-music-vitamin-c-more/|archive-date=December 20, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the February 2001 issue of ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine, Vitamin C was voted as one of the "Fun and Fearless Females" of the year. She was honored by the magazine at a luncheon on January 29, 2001, in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=110840&page=1 |title=Cosmo Honors 'Will & Grace' Star – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlinemoviemagazine.com/preview/listing/colleen_fitzpatrick/index.html |title=Naked Colleen Fitzpatrick aka Vitamin C: nude scenes from past movies (videos & pics) |publisher=Onlinemoviemagazine.com |access-date=April 9, 2012}}</ref> That same year Vitamin C was ranked No. 76 on the ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' Hot 100 Women of 2001.<ref name="maxim"/>

Vitamin C signed with [[V2 Records]] in 2001 and began recording her third album over the course of 2002 and 2003. The first single, "[[Last Nite (Vitamin C song)|Last Nite]]", was released in July 2003.

Promotional copies of the album were never made available.

In 2000, she returned to acting, playing the role of [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Westerman]] in the horror film ''[[Dracula 2000]]'' with [[Gerard Butler]] playing the part of [[Dracula]]. She also starred as herself in the spoof film ''[[Da Hip Hop Witch]]'' with [[Eminem]] in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428617/20000517/eminem.jhtml |title=Eminem, Vitamin C, More Take On "Hip-Hop Witch" |publisher=MTV |date=May 17, 2000 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>

She had a cameo in the film ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' in 2001. In addition, in 2001 she appeared in the [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Get Over It (film)|Get Over It]]'', with [[Kirsten Dunst]] and [[Sisqó]]. She made a brief comedic [[cameo appearance]] as herself (in [[voiceover]]) in the film ''[[Scary Movie 2]]''.

Her television appearances included playing a judge in the ''[[American Idol]]'' [[parody|spoof]] ''[[Superstar USA|The WB's Superstar USA]]''. She also appeared in an episode of MTV's ''[[The Andy Dick Show]]'' and the celebrity game show ''Celebrity Bootcamp''. Vitamin C made cameos on ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'', ''[[The Brothers Garcia]],'' ''[[The Amanda Show]],'' and ''[[The Sausage Factory]].'' She was one of three judges of Lifetime reality series ''Your Mama Don't Dance''. In the 1980s, she appeared on ''[[The Equalizer]].'' Also in the '80s, she appeared on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' as an "Update Dancer" during [[Dennis Miller]]'s [[Weekend Update|news segment]], in which the dancers would come out scantily clad and dance to a classic rock song.

In 2005, Vitamin C's cover of the 1980s hit "[[Voices Carry (song)|Voices Carry]]" by [['Til Tuesday]] was included on the soundtrack for the Disney superhero comedy movie ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]''.

MTV News interviewed Vitamin C in 2006 where she revealed details on a comeback, with two new albums,<ref name="mtv.com"/> though no release dates or labels have yet been cited. In the June 11 issue, ''People'' magazine had a special "Where Are They Now" article. She was about to finish work on a children's world-music album that would celebrate diversity through songs like the Indian-styled "Bhangra On and On" and "We All Share the Same Sky," and that she started work on a non-children's third Vitamin C album she described as "Goldfrapp-meets-Vitamin C," which she had hoped to have out by 2007.<ref name="mtv.com"/> Regarding the album, she had stated "Just because you're not always on MTV doesn't mean you're not actively working," she said.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1530314/20060505/vitamin_c.jhtml |title=Where Ya Been?

Vitamin C has written or co-written many songs for other artists. She wrote the song "We Are Gonna Happen" for actress/singer [[Emma Roberts]] featured on her 2005 ''[[Unfabulous and More]]'' CD. She co-wrote "Where Do We Go" with [[Scout Taylor-Compton]] in 2005. She wrote the single "[[Make Some Noise (Krystal Meyers song)|Make Some Noise]]" for [[Krystal Meyers]] in 2008. In 2009, she wrote "[[Let's Get Crazy (Hannah Montana song)|Let's Get Crazy]]" for [[Miley Cyrus]] as [[Hannah Montana]]. Miley sang the song in-character as [[Miley Stewart|Hannah Montana]] on ''[[Hannah Montana: The Movie]]'' and [[Hannah Montana (season 3)|''Hannah Montana'' (season 3)]]. Vitamin C also wrote the song "One and the Same", a duet recorded by [[Demi Lovato]] and [[Selena Gomez]] for the Disney Channel Original Movie ''[[Princess Protection Program]]'', which was later included on the ''[[Disney Channel Playlist]]'' album.

===Transition to music executive===
In 2006, she assembled a [[Radio Disney]]-aimed group of four young teenagers named [[The Truth Squad]]. She allowed the group to cover "[[Graduation (Friends Forever)]]" and wrote a number of songs for their debut album as well as producing it. The album was released on April 3, 2007, and failed to spark much interest besides a brief appearance on the [[Kid Albums|Top Kid Audio Chart]], where it peaked at No. 23 for two weeks, dropped to No. 25 the next week and by the third week had fallen off the chart completely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/t-squad-mn0000621679/discography |title=T-Squad &#124; Discography |website=AllMusic |date=April 3, 2007 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref> Despite this, the group's video for their single "Flip" had been heavily promoted on the [[Disney Channel]]. In 2006, she starred in an [[Indie (culture)|indie]] TV sitcom called ''THE LEK'' that was released to the Internet through YouTube, though to date there have been only three episodes released.

In 2007, she also assembled and produced the girl group [[The Stunners (group)|the Stunners]]. The group was signed to [[Columbia Records]] and later [[Universal Republic Records]]. In the span of four years they released an EP, two singles – one featuring hip-hop recording artists the [[New Boyz]], and four music videos. The group split in early 2011. Of the former members emerged pop singer [[Tinashe]] (formally the lead singer in the group, who went solo when the group split), ''[[The Lying Game (TV series)|The Lying Game]]'' actress [[Allie Gonino]], and [[Hayley Kiyoko]], who went on to join the [[Walt Disney Records|Disney]]-formed on-screen group [[Lemonade Mouth]] as "Stella". Furthermore, she contributed vocals to [[Information Society (band)|Information Society]]'s 2007 album, ''Synthesizer''. Her song "Money" was used in the opening of the 2010 Lifetime television movie ''Who is Clark Rockefeller?''.

On March 21, 2012, [[Nickelodeon]] named Vitamin C as VP of Music. She will oversee all music for Nickelodeon and its sister cable channels, as well as A&R and management of Nickelodeon artists.<ref name=rys/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/103977/nickelodeon-names-colleen-fitzpatrick-vp-music |title=Nickelodeon Names Colleen Fitzpatrick VP/Music |publisher=AllAccess.com |date=March 23, 2012|access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cablefax.com/cfp/just_in/Comings-and-Goings_51278.html |title=Comings & Goings :: CableFax Portal |publisher=Cablefax.com |date=March 23, 2012 |access-date=July 14, 2014}}</ref>
