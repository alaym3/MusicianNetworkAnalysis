'''BTS''' ({{Korean|방탄소년단||Bangtan Sonyeondan}}), also known as the '''Bangtan Boys''', is a South Korean [[boy band]] that was formed in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under [[Big Hit Music|Big Hit Entertainment]].<ref name="sla">{{cite magazine|last=Herman|first=Tamar|date=May 14, 2018|title=How BTS Took Over the World: A Timeline of The Group's Biggest Career Moments|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8455612/bts-takeover-timeline-bbmas|url-status=live|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122080229/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/k-town/8455612/bts-takeover-timeline-bbmas|archive-date=January 22, 2021|access-date=July 20, 2018}}</ref> The septet—consisting of members [[Kim Seok-jin|Jin]], [[Suga (rapper)|Suga]], [[J-Hope]], [[RM (rapper)|RM]], [[Jimin (singer, born 1995)|Jimin]], [[V (singer)|V]], and [[Jungkook]]—co-writes and co-produces much of their own output. Originally a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] group, their musical style has evolved to include a wide range of genres. Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and [[coming of age]], loss, the journey towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work also often references literature and psychological concepts and includes an [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternative universe]] storyline.

After debuting in 2013 with their single album ''[[2 Cool 4 Skool]]'', BTS released their first Korean-language studio album, ''[[Dark & Wild]]'', and Japanese-language studio album, ''[[Wake Up (BTS album)|Wake Up]]'', in 2014. The group's second Korean studio album, ''[[Wings (BTS album)|Wings]]'' (2016), was their first to sell one million copies in South Korea. By 2017, BTS crossed into the global music market, leading the [[Korean Wave]] into the United States and breaking numerous sales records. They became the first Korean group to receive a certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for their single "[[Mic Drop (song)|Mic Drop]]", as well as the first Korean act to top the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with their studio album ''[[Love Yourself: Tear]]'' (2018). BTS became one of the few groups since [[the Beatles]] to earn four US number-one albums in less than two years, and ''[[Love Yourself: Answer]]'' (2018) was the first Korean album certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the RIAA. In 2020, BTS became the first all-South Korean act to reach number one on the [[Billboard Global 200|''Billboard'' Global 200]] and US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with their [[63rd Annual Grammy Awards|Grammy]]-nominated single "[[Dynamite (BTS song)|Dynamite]]". Their follow-up releases "[[Savage Love (Laxed – Siren Beat)#BTS remix|Savage Love]]", "[[Life Goes On (BTS song)|Life Goes On]]", "[[Butter (song)|Butter]]", and "[[Permission to Dance]]" made BTS the fastest act to accumulate five US number-one singles since [[Michael Jackson]].

Having sold over 20 million albums on the [[Gaon Music Chart]], BTS is the best-selling artist in South Korean history and holds the [[List of best-selling albums in South Korea|best-selling album in South Korea]] with ''[[Map of the Soul: 7]]''. They are the first Asian and non-English speaking act to be named [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI) [[Global Recording Artist of the Year]] (2020), to chart on ''Billboard''{{'s}} Top Touring Artists of the 2010s (placing at number 45), and to headline and sell out [[Wembley Stadium]] and [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl Stadium]] ([[Love Yourself World Tour]] in 2019). Featured on [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']]'s international cover as "Next Generation Leaders" and dubbed "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princes of Pop]]", BTS has also appeared on the magazine's lists of the 25 most influential people on the internet (2017–2019) and the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] (2019). The group's [[List of awards and nominations received by BTS|numerous accolades]] include six [[American Music Awards]], nine [[Billboard Music Awards]], 24 [[Golden Disc Awards|Golden Disk Awards]], and nominations for two [[Grammy Awards]] and a [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]]. Outside of music, they partnered with [[UNICEF]] to establish the [[Love Myself (campaign)|Love Myself]] anti-violence campaign, addressed three [[United Nations]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assemblies]], and became the youngest ever recipients of the [[Order of Cultural Merit (Korea)|Order of Cultural Merit]] from the President of South Korea due to their contributions in spreading Korean culture and language.
