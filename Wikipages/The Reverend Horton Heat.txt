The group formed in 1986, playing its first gigs in Dallas's [[Deep Ellum]] neighborhood. The core members are Jim "Reverend Horton" Heath on guitar and lead vocals, and [[Jimbo Wallace]] on the upright bass. The band signed to [[Victory Records]] in 2012, and released its 12th studio album, ''Whole New Life,'' on December 4, 2018.

The band plays [[rock and roll]] with influences from 1950s [[Country music|country]], [[Surf music|surf]], [[Punk rock|punk]], [[big band]], [[Swing (dance)|swing]], and rockabilly standards.<ref>https://sheamagazine.com/reverend-horton-heat-live-roxy-los-angeles/</ref>

==Early career==

He was influenced by [[country music]] artists such as [[Junior Brown]], [[Willie Nelson]], and [[Merle Travis]].

"[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p85529|pure_url=yes}} Reverend Horton Heat]." [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved May 11, 2005.</ref>

Adding bassist [[Jimbo Wallace]] and drummer [[Taz Bentley]] in 1989, Reverend Horton Heat recorded for [[Sub Pop]] at [[Reciprocal Recording]] in Seattle and Crystal Clear in Dallas, which made up the majority of material on Reverend Horton Heat's debut album, ''[[Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em (The Reverend Horton Heat album)|Smoke 'Em If You Got 'Em]]'' (1990).<ref>https://tapeop.com/interviews/134/jim-heath-reverend-horton-heat/</ref> For the next album, the band recorded with [[Gibby Haynes]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] producing at [[Ardent Studios]] in Memphis: ''[[The Full Custom Gospel Sounds of the Reverend Horton Heat]]'' (1993).

==Commercial appearances==
"[[Psychobilly Freakout]]", and later "Wiggle Stick", were both featured in video segments on the show ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]''.

The 1997 video game ''[[Redneck Rampage]]'' also includes two of their songs, "Wiggle Stick" and "Nurture my Pig!". The song "Big Red Rocket of Love" is featured in the video games ''[[The Sims 3]]'', ''[[MotorStorm (video game)|MotorStorm]]'' and ''[[Need for Speed: The Run]]'', and a slightly altered version of the song was featured in a 1999 television commercial for the [[Mazda Miata]].

== Equipment ==
Heath has a signature guitar from the [[Gretsch]] Guitar company, the [[Gretsch 6120|6120RHH]]. One of his favorite vintage guitars is a 1954 [[Gibson ES-175]], which he rarely plays on the road since its wiring buzzes in certain venues. His favorite amplifier was the [[Fender Super Reverb]] but is now the Gretsch Executive.<ref>{{cite journal| last = Heidt
