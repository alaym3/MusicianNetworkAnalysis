'''Sixpence None the Richer''' (also known as '''Sixpence''') is an American [[Christian alternative rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]] that formed in [[New Braunfels, Texas]], and eventually settled in [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. They are best known for their songs "[[Kiss Me (Sixpence None the Richer song)|Kiss Me]]" and "[[Breathe Your Name]]" and their [[cover version|covers]] of "[[Don't Dream It's Over]]" and "[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]". The name of the band is inspired by a passage from the book ''[[Mere Christianity]]'' by [[C. S. Lewis]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJDldjmb_04| title=Leigh Nash (with Sixpence None the Richer) on Letterman |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>{{better source|date=October 2021}}

==History==

===Origin of the band's name===
Vocalist [[Leigh Nash]] described the origin of the band's name on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'':<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefish.com/music/reviews/11620504/|title=Grow in Faith with Daily Christian Living Articles|work=Crosswalk.com}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=October 2021}}

{{Quote|It comes from a book by C. S. Lewis called ''[[Mere Christianity]]''. A little boy asks his father if he can get a sixpence—a very small amount of English currency in use at the time—to go and get a gift for his father. The father gladly accepts the gift and he's really happy with it, but he also realizes that he's not any richer for the transaction. C.S. Lewis was comparing that to his belief that God has given him, and us, the gifts that we possess, and to serve him the way we should, we should do it humbly—realizing how we got the gifts in the first place.}}

===Formation and early years (1992–1996)===
Guitarist/songwriter [[Matt Slocum]] met Leigh Nash in the early 1990s. They recorded a demo, which circulates as "The Original Demos", with bassist T.J. Behling at Verge Music Works recording studio in Dallas, and eventually an album, ''[[The Fatherless and the Widow]]'', for the independent label REX Music in 1993. After adding more members, the band toured in support of ''The Fatherless and The Widow''. The band released ''[[This Beautiful Mess]]'' in 1995.

===Into the mainstream (1997–2004)===
In 1997, the group signed to [[Steve Taylor]]'s label [[Squint Entertainment]] and released [[Sixpence None the Richer (album)|a self-titled album]], which slowly began garnering attention from a wider audience in the mainstream industry. 

In 1998, "[[Kiss Me (Sixpence None the Richer song)|Kiss Me]]" was released as a single, propelling Sixpence None the Richer into the national pop spotlight.  The next year, the band followed up "Kiss Me" with a cover of [[The La's]]' "[[There She Goes (The La's song)|There She Goes]]".  Sixpence appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', and numerous morning talk shows. 

The band had a follow-up album ready to release, but their label [[Squint Entertainment]] started to fall apart, leaving the band in limbo for several years. Finally, Squint Entertainment folded and that album, ''[[Divine Discontent]]'', was released in October 2002.

On February 26, 2004, Matt Slocum announced that the group had disbanded. 

=== Reunion and ''Lost in Transition'' (2007–present) ===
In November 2007, Sixpence None the Richer reunited. They released the EP ''[[My Dear Machine]]'' on the website [[NoiseTrade]] in 2008, the band's first official release since ''The Best of Sixpence None the Richer'' in 2004. 

In October 2008, they released a Christmas album titled ''[[The Dawn of Grace]]''.

Sixpence signed to [[Credential Recordings]] and played a headline slot at the 2009 [[Greenbelt Festival]] in the UK. According to [[Leigh Nash]], the band began recording a new album in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=600645395&ref=search&sid=516032932.2693688637..1#/profile.php?id=600645395&ref=mf| title=Leigh Nash's Facebook Page |publisher=Facebook}}</ref>{{better source|date=October 2021}} The album was released on August 7, 2012.

On November 12, 2016, the band performed at Love Love Rock Festival in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]], including hits "Don't Dream It's Over", "Kiss Me" and "There She Goes".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvmWBw8P_lA|title=105.11.12 [Love Love Rock］Sixpence None the Richer-Kiss me|last=Hi|date=November 12, 2016|access-date=March 22, 2018|via=YouTube}}</ref>{{better source|date=October 2021}}
