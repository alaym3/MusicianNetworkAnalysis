'''Night Off''' (1962 &ndash; after 1978) was an Irish-bred, British-trained [[Thoroughbred]] [[horse racing|racehorse]] and [[Horse breeding#Terminology|broodmare]] best known for winning the [[British Classic Races|classic]] [[1000 Guineas]] in 1965. Despite running only twice in 1964 she was the top-rated filly in Britain after a win in the [[Cheveley Park Stakes]]. After recovering from illness to win the 1000 Guineas in April 1965 her form deteriorated, with a second place at [[Royal Ascot]] being her only notable performance in five subsequent races. She had some success as a broodmare, despite producing only five foals.

==Background==
Night Off was a bay mare with no white [[Horse markings|markings]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporthorse-data.com/horse/10131874/824/Horse_Night_Off-_2big.jpg |title=Night Off photo |publisher=sporthorse-data.com |access-date=2013-06-05}}</ref> bred by her owner, Major Lionel Brook Holliday at his Cleaboy stud in [[County Westmeath]]. Holliday sent the filly to his private La Grange stable at [[Newmarket, Suffolk]] where she was trained by Walter Wharton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.edunlop.com/history.html |title=La Grange Stables â€“ History |publisher=Edunlop.com |access-date=2013-05-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828122948/http://edunlop.com/history.html |archive-date=2013-08-28 }}</ref>

Night Off was the most notable racehorse sired by Holliday's stallion Narrator, who won the [[Champion Stakes]] and the [[Coronation Cup]] for his owner in the mid 1950s. Her dam, Persuader, won five races including the 1956 [[Horris Hill Stakes]], and produced several other winners including Night Off's full brother No Argument. Persuader's dam Palma Rosa, was a French-bred mare bought by Holliday from [[Marcel Boussac]] for 10,500 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]].<ref name="Mortimer">{{cite book | last1 = Mortimer|first1=Roger |last2=Onslow|first2=Richard|last3=Willett|first3=Peter| title=Biographical Encyclopedia of British Flat Racing|publisher=Macdonald and Jane's| year=1978|isbn=0-354-08536-0}}</ref>

==Racing career==

===1964: two-year-old season===
Night Off made her first racecourse appearance at [[Newmarket Racecourse]] in August when she finished second in the Prendergast Stakes.<ref name="Mortimer"/> At the same course in late September she was moved up in class to contest the Cheveley Park Stakes, Britain's most prestigious race for two-year-old fillies. Ridden by [[Joe Mercer (jockey)|Joe Mercer]] she started at odds of [[Fractional odds|20/1]] and won from the odds-on favourite Fall In Love with Greengage in third place.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HN1AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CacMAAAAIBAJ&pg=6173,3865265&dq=night-off+newmarket&hl=en |title=Night Off for the nap |work=[[Evening Times]] |date=28 April 1965 |access-date=2013-06-05}}</ref> In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to have raced in Britain that year, she was the top-rated filly, nine pounds behind the leading colt Double Jump.<ref name="Guinness">{{cite book|last1=Morris|first1=Tony|last2=Randall|first2=John| title=Horse Racing: Records, Facts, Champions|edition=Third|publisher=Guinness Publishing |year=1990|isbn=0-85112-902-1}}</ref>

===1965: three-year-old season===
In the spring of 1965, Night Off was one of many British horses to be affected by a respiratory infection which disrupted her training. Despite her problems she recovered sufficiently to contest the [[1000 Guineas]] over the Rowley Mile course at Newmarket on 29 April. The filly was ridden by the Australian jockey [[Bill Williamson]] and started the 9/2 favourite in a field of sixteen. Night Off won the classic by a neck from Yami, with Mabel three lengths away in third.<ref name="Mortimer"/> Night Off was then aimed at the [[Epsom Oaks|Oaks]], but when tried over ten [[furlong]]s in the [[Musidora Stakes]] at [[York Racecourse]] she finished unplaced behind Arctic Melody. On 21 May, Night Off was withdrawn from the Oaks by Holliday who thought she had been drugged or poisoned, stating that the filly was "in a terrible state, almost dead."<ref name="drugging">{{cite news|last=UPI|title=Choice in England Scratched Amid Charges of Drugging|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 21, 1965|page=25}}</ref> A drug test was administered by the Jockey Club but was negative.<ref>{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Market Best Guide After Derby Trials|newspaper=The Times|date=May 24, 1965|page=5|issue=56329}}</ref>

In June Night Off was brought back in distance for the [[Coronation Stakes]] over a mile at [[Royal Ascot]]. She looked the likely winner in the straight but was caught on the line and beaten a short head by Greengage.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W25AAAAAIBAJ&sjid=iqMMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5890,2800750&dq=night-off+guineas&hl=en |title=Sticky going suits Casabianca |work=[[Glasgow Herald]] |author="Harkaway" |date=17 June 1965 |access-date=2013-06-05}}</ref> Her form then tailed off and she ran poorly in her three remaining races before being retired at the end of the year.<ref name="Mortimer"/>

==Assessment==
The independent [[Timeform]] organisation awarded Night Off a rating of 124 in 1964, making her one of the highest rated two-year-old fillies in Europe. In 1965, however, she was given a rating of 113, one of the lowest ever given to a classic winner, and thirteen pounds behind the top-rated three-year-old filly [[Aunt Edith]].<ref name="Guinness"/> In their book ''A Century of Champions'', based on a modified version of the Timeform system John Randall and Tony Morris rated Night Off a "poor" winner of the [[1000 Guineas]].<ref name="century">{{cite book|last1=Morris| first1=Tony|last2=Randall|first2=John|title=A Century of Champions|publisher= Portway Press|year=1999|isbn=978-1-901570-15-1}}</ref>

==Stud career==
Night Off produced only five foals in twelve years at stud, but three of them were winners. The best of her progeny was the filly Madame's Share (sired by Major Portion) who won [[Prix d'Astarte]] in 1971. Another of her daughters, Sweet Relations, produced Montekin, winner of the 1983 [[Celebration Mile|Waterford Crystal Mile]]. Her son Baldur, (by Breton), showed promise as a two-year-old in 1974 when he finished third to [[Grundy (horse)|Grundy]] in the [[Dewhurst Stakes]] but he did not go on to any major successes.<ref name="Timeform1983">{{cite book | author=Timeform| title = Racehorses of 1983| publisher=Timeform | year = 1984| isbn = 0-900599-40-5}}</ref>
