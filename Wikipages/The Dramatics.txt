'''The Dramatics''' are an American [[soul music]] [[vocal group]], formed in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in 1964. They are best known for their 1970s hit songs "[[In the Rain (song)|In the Rain]]" and "[[Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get (song)|Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get]]", both of which were Top 10 Pop hits,<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

The Dramatics, founded by Ron Banks (May 10, 1951 – March 4, 2010),<ref name=latimes>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-passings6-2010mar06-story.html|title=PASSINGS: Lolly Vegas, Ron Banks|date=March 6, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=September 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name=billboard>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/959129/dramatics-founder-ron-banks-dies|title=Dramatics Founder Ron Banks Dies|author=Gail Mitchell|date=March 5, 2010|publisher=Billboard|access-date=September 13, 2020}}</ref> Larry Demps, Rod Davis, Elbert Wilkins and Larry Reed, originally formed in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jbiRnqQ3hs|title=Ron Banks states what year The Dramatics were formed at 3:30 in this interview |website=Youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67vst8QBzds|title=Willie Ford states what year The Dramatics were formed at 5:05 in this interview |website=Youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6xe4nc|title=Dramatics - Unsung TV One 30 July 2017, stating who the founding members were |website=Dailymotion.com}}</ref> They were originally known as the Sensations, but changed their billing to the Dramatics in 1965.<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=74/5}}</ref> Their first release in 1965 entitled "Bingo" was recorded for Wingate, a division of [[Golden World Records]] in Detroit, Michigan. By 1967, [[Motown]] had absorbed the entire Golden World Records operation. The Dramatics then moved to another local Detroit label, Sport Records, where they garnered their first minor [[hit single]], "All Because of You."<ref name="LarkinSM"/> After becoming a victim in the July 1967 [[Algiers Motel incident]], including the police killing of the group's valet Fred Temple, Reed and Davis eventually left the group, and were replaced by William Wee Gee Howard and Willie Ford (July 10, 1950 – May 28, 2019)<ref name=richmondfreepress>{{cite web|url=http://richmondfreepress.com/news/2019/jun/07/willie-lee-ford-jr-founder-dramatics-dies-68/|title=Willie Lee Ford Jr., a founder of The Dramatics, dies at 68|date=July 7, 2019|website=Richmondfreepress.com|access-date=September 13, 2020}}</ref> in 1969.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6xe4nc|title=Dramatics - Unsung TV One 30 July 2017 |website=Dailymotion.com}}</ref>
 
The Dramatics signed with [[Stax Records]] of Memphis, Tennessee in 1968, but moved on after one unsuccessful release, the 1969 Temptations-inspired tune "Your Love Was Strange" (Volt VOA 4029), written by group members Ron Banks, William "Wee Gee" Howard, and Elbert "Al" Wilkins, which got regional airplay, but never charted nationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/voa4029|title=Dramatics - Your Love Was Strange|access-date=May 30, 2019|website=45cat.com}}</ref> This song was re-released as the "B" side to the hit, "Toast To The Fool" (Volt VOA 4082) three years later.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45cat.com/record/recordus22|title=Dramatics - Toast To The Fool|access-date=May 30, 2019|website=45cat.com}}</ref> However, producer Don Davis re-signed them to Volt, a Stax subsidiary, in 1971 after the group teamed up with Detroit writer-producer, Tony Hester.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> They broke through with their first release recorded with Hester, "[[Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get (song)|Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get]]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> which Hester offered them after seeing the group perform in a Detroit nightclub. The song went into the [[Top 40|Top 10]] of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], peaking at number 9 and climbing to number 3 in the R&B chart.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>  "Whatcha See Is Whatcha Get" was awarded [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] status by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|R.I.A.A.]] in December 1971.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

Their members at this time were Ron Banks (who died of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] on March 4, 2010, at the age of 58),<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-banks/dramatics-founder-ron-banks-58-dies-idUSTRE6250ES20100306 |last=Mitchell |first=Gail |title=Dramatics founder Ron Banks, 58, Dies |website=Reuters.com |date=March 5, 2010 |access-date=August 30, 2020}}</ref> William "Wee Gee" Howard (who died of a heart attack on February 22, 2000, at the age of 49),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/112583735/william-franklin-howard |author=W. Arnold Holmes |title=William Franklin Howard II |website=Find a Grave |date=June 19, 2013 |access-date=August 30, 2020}}</ref> Elbert Wilkins (who died of a heart attack on December 13, 1992, at the age of 45), Willie Ford (who died May 28, 2019, at the age of 68), and Larry Demps. These five members are often thought of as the original Dramatics, though it is more accurate to call them "the Classic Five", as only Ron Banks, Larry Demps and Elbert Wilkins were part of the original line-up. This quartet are the five singers that the general public first got to know as the Dramatics.

Shortly after the success of their first [[album]], Howard and Wilkins left the group,<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and formed their own version of The Dramatics, recording the single "No Rebate On Love" on Mainstream Records. They were replaced by Larry James "L.J." Reynolds and Leonard "Lenny" Mayes (who died of [[lung cancer]] on November 8, 2004, at the age of 53).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> At the urging of Don Davis and Stax Records, the original group changed its billing to "Ron Banks and the Dramatics". These two groups toured the concert circuit for four years before Banks' group won a court battle, when they bought Howard and Wilkins out and gained full access to the name.<ref>Taylor, Marc (1996). ''A Touch of Classic Soul of The Early 1970s'', p. 62. Aloiv Publishing, Jamaica, New York. {{ISBN|0-9652328-4-0}}.</ref> Howard and Wilkins were forced to change the name of their group to "A Dramatic Experience". Banks, Demps and Ford then had the trademark rights to the name, and then extended that right to Mayes and Reynolds.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6xe4nc|title=Dramatics - Unsung TV One 30 July 2017 |website=Dailymotion.com}}</ref>

Through the 1970s, the group continued to have successful songs, including the Top 10 Pop, number 1 [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] hit, "[[In the Rain (song)|In the Rain]]" in 1972, "Hey You! Get Off My Mountain" (number 5 R&B), "[[Me and Mrs Jones]]" (number 4 R&B), originally recorded by [[Billy Paul]] three years earlier, "[[Be My Girl (The Dramatics song)|Be My Girl]]" (number 3 R&B), and "Shake It Well" (number 4 R&B).<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "In the Rain" also reached number 5 on the Hot 100 pop chart and was their second million-seller.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

The group recorded for [[Don Davis (record producer)|Don Davis']] Groovesville and later Great Lakes music production companies during the 1970s, although the recordings appeared on several labels. The group moved from Volt in 1974 after three albums, releasing one album on [[Chess Records]]' subsidiary Cadet, sharing tracks with The Dells, who were also being produced by Davis at the time. The group then signed for ABC in 1975 and transferred five years later to MCA, after ABC closed following its buy-out by MCA.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Many of the Dramatics' songs initially were written and produced by Tony Hester, including all the tracks on the first two Volt albums. Davis, then Banks and Reynolds took over production later in the 1970s and the early 1980s.

In 1982, the group moved to Capitol Records and made their first album without Don Davis, with Banks acting as producer. Only Banks, Ford and Mayes remained in the group. L.J. Reynolds left to go solo in 1981<ref name="LarkinSM"/> and Larry Demps decided to go into teaching and spend more time with his family, after having joined the group's original line-up in 1964 with Banks. When Ron Banks also decided to try a solo career, the group disbanded for a few years, but re-formed in the mid-1980s, with Howard returning to join Reynolds, Mayes, Ford and Banks to record for Fantasy Records.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

From 2012 there were two groups of The Dramatics. One group was led by L.J. Reynolds, with Winzell Kelly, Leon Franklin, and Donald Albert. The other group was led by the original member of The Dramatics, Willie Ford, with Rick Littleton, Michael Brock, Douglas Gaddy and Gregory Finley,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newpittsburghcourier.com/2016/05/19/dramatics-deliver-despite-set-backs|title=A presentation of The Dramatics featuring Willie Ford in a newspaper article in New Pittsburgh Courier 2016-05-19 |website=Newpittsburghcourier.com}}</ref> in 2017 long time member Paul Hill, of funk legend George Clinton’s Parliament Funkadelic band joined Willie Ford Dramatics. The Dramatics Featuring Willie Ford focused on staying true to The Dramatics' original and easily recognizable concept of five part harmonies and five dynamic lead voices in the group, at their shows. L.J. Reynolds' Dramatics featured the singing-talents of Reynolds and also included music from Reynolds' solo career at their shows. On September 24, 2018 L.J. Reynolds legally took the trademark rights to the name The Dramatics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/thedramaticsofficial/photos/a.1904471516535599/2099915476991201/?type=3&theater|title=L.J. Reynolds claiming full ownership of the trademark The Dramatics September 24 2018 on his official Dramatics page |website=Facebook.com}}</ref>

The Dramatics were officially inducted into the [[Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame|R&B Music Hall of Fame]] at [[Cleveland State University]]'s Waetejen Auditorium on Saturday August 17, 2013.

The Dramatics are depicted centrally in the 2017, [[Kathryn Bigelow]] film ''[[Detroit (film)|Detroit]]'', a [[Adaptation (arts)|dramatization]] of the [[Algiers Motel incident]].

On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed The Dramatics among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite news |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=June 28, 2019 |date=June 25, 2019}}</ref>
