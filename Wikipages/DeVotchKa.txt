'''DeVotchKa''' is an American four-piece multi-instrumental and vocal ensemble. They take their name from the [[Russian language|Russian]] word ''devochka'' (девочка), meaning "girl". Based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], the quartet is made up of Nick Urata, who sings and plays [[theremin]], [[guitar]], [[bouzouki]], [[piano]], and [[trumpet]]; Tom Hagerman, who plays [[violin]], [[accordion]], and piano; Jeanie Schroder, who sings and plays [[sousaphone]], [[double bass]], and [[flute]]; and Shawn King, who plays [[percussion]] and trumpet.

==History==
Originally a backing band for [[American burlesque|burlesque]] shows, in their early years DeVotchKa also toured with burlesque performer and model [[Dita Von Teese]]. Numerous nationwide tours in support of self-released records earned the band an underground following. Their song "How It Ends" introduced the band to a wider audience after being featured in the trailer for ''[[Everything Is Illuminated (film)|Everything Is Illuminated]]'', in a ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' trailer called "The Last Day", and in an episode of [[Everwood]]. Their performance at the 2006 [[Bonnaroo]] music festival was considered a breakout event. {{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In between tours, the band was picked by first time film directors [[Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris]] to score ''[[Little Miss Sunshine]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449059/soundtrack |title=Little Miss Sunshine (2006)&nbsp;– Soundtrack |publisher=imdb.com |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref> a [[2006 in film|2006]] film that would go on to garner four [[Academy Award]] nominations. DeVotchKa, along with composer [[Mychael Danna]], composed and performed the majority of the music for the film's [[Little Miss Sunshine (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] and were nominated for a [[Grammy Awards of 2007|2006 Grammy Award]] for Best Compilation Soundtrack. The main song, "The Winner Is", was also used in a commercial by the French-based environment and energy company [[Suez (company)|Suez]] and the Dutch pension fund [[PGGM]].

In 2006, [[Arcade Fire]] singer [[Win Butler]] suggested to DeVotchKa that they arrange the [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]] song "[[Peepshow (album)|The Last Beat of My Heart]]". The musicians found the idea interesting and they recorded that song for the now critically acclaimed ''[[Curse Your Little Heart]]'' EP.<ref>{{cite web|last=Frenette |first=Brad |url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2011/03/07/devotchka-finds-joy-in-the-sadness/ |title=DeVotchKa finds joy in the sadness – interview |work=National Post |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=20 January 2014 |quote=We were playing in Montreal, and Arcade Fire stopped by, back in the earlier days.

Could the band itself even have predicted what would transpire from the Arcade Fire's Win Butler's suggestion to the band that they take on 'Last Beat of My Heart?' The end result is the center-piece of the EP, a grand and soaring take on the song; a testament to the band's true unique ability to transform nearly anything via a sound only DeVotchka can create, and perhaps a look at the epic nature of where the band's own recordings may move in the future.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616044837/https://www.laphil.com/philpedia/artist-detail.cfm/?id=3144|url-status=unfit|archive-date=9 January 2018}}</ref>
