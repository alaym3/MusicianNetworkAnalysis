'''Future Islands''' is an American [[synth-pop]] band based in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], comprising Gerrit Welmers (keyboards and programming), William Cashion (bass, acoustic and electric guitars), [[Samuel T. Herring]] (lyrics and vocals), and Michael Lowry (percussion). The band was formed in January 2006 by Welmers, Cashion and Herring—the remaining members of the performance art college band [[Art Lord & the Self-Portraits]]—and drummer Erick Murillo.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web | url = http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/future_islands_-_the_under_the_radar_cover_story/ | title = Future Islands - The Under the Radar Cover Story | last = Studarus | first = Laura  | date = September 23, 2014 | website = Undertheradarmag.com | publisher = Under the Radar Magazine (Publish on paper Issue #50 - June/July 2014 - Future Islands) | access-date = April 16, 2017}}</ref>

Future Islands came to prominence in 2014 with their fourth album ''[[Singles (Future Islands album)|Singles]]'' released by [[4AD]].

The strain of the band's first two consecutive national tours led to the end of Herring's long-term relationship in late 2008.<ref name="CityPaper2011"/>  This became the theme of Future Islands' second album ''[[In Evening Air]]'' whose first songs were written right after the breakup. In early 2009, the band toured Europe for the first time. The song "Tin Man" took the band through [[Dan Deacon]]'s ''[[Bromst]]'' US and European tour.

Later that year, the band signed to independent record company [[Thrill Jockey]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thrilljockey.com/artists/?id=12491 | title=Future Islands |author=Thrill Jockey Records | access-date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://pitchfork.com/news/37143-future-islands-sign-to-thrill-jockey/ | title=Future Islands Sign to Thrill Jockey | author=Tom Breihan|date=November 17, 2009| website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=April 18, 2017 }}</ref> It was [[Double Dagger (band)|Double Dagger]]'s bassist Bruce Willen who was responsible for giving the label a demo that contained early mixes of "Tin Man", "Walking Through That Door", "Long Flight" and "As I Fall".<ref name="auto2"/><ref name="CityPaper2011"/> Future Islands began writing the rest of the album after Whartscape 2009<ref name="CityPaper2011"/> and recorded it in the band's living room<ref name="auto9"/> in the historic [[Upton, Baltimore#Marble Hill|Marble Hill]] neighborhood in [[Baltimore]], with Chester Enderby Gwazda<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2010/03/18/interview-chester-gwazda-ace-producer | title = Interview: Chester Gwazda, Ace Producer | author =  Jason Baxter | date = March 18, 2010 | website =Thestranger.com | publisher = The Stranger | access-date = April 21, 2017}}</ref> in July 2009.<ref name="auto5"/><ref name="auto2"/><ref name="auto4"/> Released May 4, 2010, the cover art was again designed by Kymia Nawabi.

{{main|On the Water (album)}}
[[File:Future_Islands_2012.jpg|thumb|260px|Future Islands in 2012 at the Dockville festival in Hamburg, Germany]]

Following a year of solid touring, Future Islands recorded their third album ''[[On the Water (album)|On the Water]]'' in [[Elizabeth City]], North Carolina, between late May and early June 2011 with producer Chester Endersby Gwazda. William Cashion commented "Being secluded and free from distractions was the most important aspect of our going to North Carolina. Our friend Abe [Sanders] pretty much let us take over his house for ten days, and that gave us a lot of freedom to focus on writing and recording."<ref name="auto15">{{cite web | url = http://blog.ourstage.com/2011/12/22/exclusive-qa-future-islands-gaze-out-on-the-water/ | title = Exclusive Q&A: Future Islands Gaze Out 'On the Water'| author = contributingwriter | date = December 22, 2011 | website =Ourstage.com| publisher = Ourstage | access-date = April 21, 2017}}</ref>

Not wanting to be pigeonholed, the band went against the expectation generated by ''[[In Evening Air]]'', and the upbeat tone of the previous album was followed by a slow-burning record.<ref name="Wireless2017"/><ref>{{cite web | url = http://nbhap.com/people/interview-future-islands-the-far-field/ | title = Interview with Future Islands: 'Doing exactly what we've always done' | author = Stefan Kutschera | date = March 23, 2017 | website =Nbhap.com| publisher = Nothing but Hope and Passion| access-date = April 14, 2017}}</ref> Welmers' dance-floor-ready synthesizer and Cashion's uptempo bass  were stripped down.<ref name="CityPaper2011"/> The tone of the lyrics changed, according to Herring: "Because I didn't have that same anger, so I don't write about it."<ref name="CityPaper2011"/>

Friction between the band and [[Thrill Jockey]] started to appear during the recording sessions, as Herring commented: "We had some issues. There was someone from the label hanging around talking about deadlines. Can we not talk about business while writing a song? Do you want it to be a good album, or do you want it to come out on time?"<ref name="auto11"/>

Pressured by their label, the band rushed the mix and promotion of the album.<ref name="auto11"/>  The lead single "Before the Bridge/Find Love" was released on July 19, 2011, and the album on October 11, 2011. It featured a duet with [[Jenn Wasner]] from [[Wye Oak (band)|Wye Oak]] on the track "The Great Fire"<ref name="auto15"/> and the art cover was designed by Baltimore artist Elena Johnston.<ref name="auto15"/> After one year of touring ''On the Water'', the band broke ties with their label.<ref name="auto11"/>

On July 17, 2012, Future Islands released a charity split single with Baltimore band Ed Schrader's Music Beat through Famous Class records, featuring the song "Cotton Flower"<ref>{{cite web | url = http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/13850-future-islands-cotton-flower/ | title = Future Islands "Cotton Flower" | author = Larry Fitzmaurice | date = July 9, 2012 | website =Pitchfork.com | publisher = Pitchfork | access-date = April 21, 2017}}</ref> and on September 3, 2012, they released the single "Tomorrow/The Fountain" through their previous label—Upset the Rhythm.

They started writing in February 2013<ref name="auto6"/> in a rented hunting cabin in rural North Carolina, while rehearsing for the ten-year anniversary of Art Lord & the Self-Portraits' first show. About the writing process, Herring described: "We ended up demoing about 24 or 25 songs, then went into the studio and decided to do 13 of those, and by the end of it we decided it would be a ten-track record. The writing process started in February – there were two or three songs that we had from the year before that we'd demoed – we stopped writing in the last week of July, and went into the studio in the first week of August. So there was a good five and a half, six months of writing, and getting together two or three times a week over that period to just jam and see what came up."<ref name="auto6" />

The band financed the album and recorded it at the Dreamland studios in [[Hurley, New York]], in August 2013 with producer [[Chris Coady]]. In early 2014, the Future Islands announced they had signed a three-album deal to [[4AD]], who released ''[[Singles (Future Islands album)|Singles]]'' on March 24, 2014.

We set up in the living room, we'd get up every day and start jamming after our morning coffee and just go all day. We wrote about eight songs there, and about three of them made it onto the record.

The album featured a duet with [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s [[Debbie Harry]]. As in the album ''[[In Evening Air]]'', the title comes from [[Theodore Roethke]]'s poetry work and the cover art — a piece titled ''Chrysanthemum Trance'' — is again by Kymia Nawabi.<ref name="auto8"/>

===Musical style and influences===

Future Islands' music style has been tagged as [[synth-pop]], but the band has routinely rejected that classification, considering themselves as "post-wave",<ref name="auto12"/> by combining the romanticism of [[New wave music|new wave]] with the power and drive of [[post-punk]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://thequietus.com/articles/04286-future-islands-in-evening-air-album-review| title = Reviews: Future Islands IN EVENING AIR| last = Dix| first = Michael | date = May 19, 2010 | website =Thequietus.com | publisher = The Quietus| access-date = April 15, 2017}}</ref>

The band's members came from very different musical backgrounds and sensibilities: Sam Herring grew up performing [[hip-hop]], Gerrit Welmers was into [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]]<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.smilepolitely.com/music/defining_fame_with_future_islands/| title = Defining fame with Future Islands| last = Scherer| first = James | date = September 13, 2016 | website =Smilepolitely.com | publisher = Smile Politely| access-date = April 15, 2017}}</ref> and William Cashion was into [[indie rock]], [[grunge]], [[krautrock]] and new wave, so a lot of the band's synth-pop influences come from him. Cashion was also a big fan of [[The Cure]] and [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], and was influenced by bassists [[Peter Hook]] from [[Joy Division]] and [[New Order (band)|New Order]], and [[Kim Deal]] from [[The Pixies]] and [[The Breeders]].<ref name="auto8"/>

While Welmers and Herring found common ground through [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and [[Kool Keith]],<ref name="auto8"/> it was through [[Kraftwerk]]'s "[[Trans-Europe Express (song)|Trans-Europe Express]]" which was sampled by [[Afrika Bambaataa]] that Cashion and Herring found some common ground when forming the Art Lord & the Self-Portraits.<ref name="musicfeeds2015">

These kinds of things defined us early on and we kept with that sound, kept painting with that palette."<ref name="smilepolitely2016">

Herring named [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD) as "one of the biggest influences on Future Islands". He said of their 1983 album, ''[[Dazzle Ships (album)|Dazzle Ships]]'', "We all just fell in love with it. We couldn't stop listening to it, and it really just became a huge inspiration and influence in creating our second album ''[[In Evening Air]]''."<ref name="Wireless2017"/> Cashion affirmed that the entire band has drawn inspiration from OMD's "immense heart and soul".<ref>{{cite book|first=Richard|last=Houghton|year=2019|title=OMD: Pretending to See the Future|edition=expanded paperback|publisher=This Day in Music Books|pages=363–364|isbn=978-1916115620}}</ref>

===Songwriting and vocals===
{{quote box
 |quote = I've always considered myself a singer third on the list—I'm a writer, I'm a performer and I'm a singer. I don't really think of myself as a musician.

In Future Islands writing process, Gerrit Welmers and William Cashion develop the music which Sam Herring responds to with the lyrics.<ref name="auto4"/> Herring's sad lyrics often contrast with the upbeat mood of the music. He explains: "Where the songs have always been kind of upbeat and happy, the message is often melancholy. I like it that way, people's natural instinct is to let their guards down and dance, and then they actually let the words seep in. Instead of turning away from the darkness, they embrace the light and find the darkness. I think the opposite is true too."<ref name="auto4"/>

Literary influences on Herring's writing include poet [[Theodore Roethke]]—whose anthology ''The Far Field'' names Future Islands' 2017 album and includes the "In Evening Air" poem that names their 2010 album<ref name="auto8"/>—and poet [[Jack Gilbert]]: whose poem and anthology "The Great Fires" names one of the band's songs. Herring also admitted being influenced by [[Italo Calvino]]'s prose during the time he wrote the single "The Fountain".

In the spring of 2014, Sam Herring was diagnosed with [[Reinke's edema]].<ref name="auto10"/> According to him "There's four causes. Acid reflux, smoking, talking too much or overuse of the vocal cords, and then chronic misuse of the vocal cords ... which is how I sing. So, basically, I was four for four."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.stereogum.com/1725890/spirit-of-2014-future-islands-reflect-on-their-breakthrough-year/franchises/cover-story/ | title = Spirit Of 2014: Future Islands Reflect On Their Breakthrough Year | author = Ryan Leas  | date = December 22, 2014 | website = Stereogum.com | publisher = Stereogum | access-date = April 16, 2017}}</ref> Herring started compensating for the fact that he can no longer hit certain notes by growling, which in turn became distinctive on his vocals.

===Live performances===
[[File:Future_Islands,_Kosmonaut_Festival_2015_02.JPG|thumb|260px|Sam Herring at the Kosmonaut Festival (2015)]]
More than a studio band, Future Islands define themselves as a live band and have toured extensively. Frontman Sam Herring is known by his stage performances. According to William Cashion "A lot of the energy of the show comes from the audience. If the audience is putting off energy, we're able to bounce it back. It's like a feedback loop. If the audience is there with us and they're giving us their energy, then it'll be easy for us to find it."<ref name="auto16"/>

The style and presentation of the [[Art Lord & the Self-Portraits]] was determined by the art school backgrounds of its members: the band was meant to be a performance art piece. Herring has cited [[Ian Curtis]], [[James Brown]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref name="Wireless2017"/><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/music-festivals/10975049/Latitude-Festival-2014-Future-Islands-the-breakthrough-band-of-the-year.html| title = Latitude Festival 2014: Future Islands - the breakthrough band of the year| last = Smith| first = Patrick| date = July 18, 2014 | website =Telegraph.co.uk | publisher = The Telegraph | access-date = April 15, 2017}}</ref> as influences but his background in performance art and conceptual art also became reflected in his stage presence, even for Future Islands.<ref name="auto6"/>

"I fell in love with performance art when I was 17 and that was the thing that I found: I just would sit and draw for 20 hours straight and make this thing photorealistic and then put it on a board and then people see it and that's it, or you can stand on the street and perform for 30 minutes with some weird thing you came up with off the top of your head, act out a play to no one but people are going to walk by and you're going to get a reaction. They may not get what you're doing or care about what you're doing, but there's something, you sparked something in their heads. And that's an exciting thing, to look into people's eyes. There's no expectation—you can create a memory for people, like I said, good or bad. It can grab people and that's a cool thing."<ref>{{cite web | url = https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/future-islands-interview| title = Future Islands Have Been Freaking You Out for Eight Years| last = Gordon| first = Jeremy | date = March 26, 2017 | website =Noisey.vice.com | publisher = Noisey | access-date = April 15, 2017}}</ref>

Herring's dedication to stage performance has not been without physical consequenses. When touring Europe as part of the Dan Deacon Ensemble supporting the album ''[[Bromst]]'', Herring was tackled by a drunken spectator in [[Paris]].<ref name="auto18">{{cite web | url = http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/arts/music/blog/13073488/whiskey-cigarettes-and-the-tom-waits-school-of-voice-a-chat-with-future-islands | title = Romantic Post-Wave and the Tom Waits School of Voice: A Chat with Future Islands | author = Jonathan L. Fisher | date = April 22, 2010 | website =Washingtoncitypaper.com | publisher = Washington Citypaper | access-date = April 21, 2017}}</ref> Six months later he realized he had torn his [[anterior cruciate ligament]] and underwent surgery in February 2010,<ref name="auto18"/> continuing to perform shows in the following months wearing a knee brace, which can be seen on the June 24, 2010 [[Amoeba Music|Amoeba]] show footage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Future Islands - Hollywood - Jun 24, 2010|url=https://www.amoeba.com/live-shows/detail-1645#cat-most_recent_shows/-/urle-video-gallery|website=Amoeba Music|access-date=30 June 2017}}</ref> In 2014 Herring passed out at the airport on his way to [[Primavera Sound|Primavera]] festival due to exhaustion.

===Cover artwork===
Coming from an art background Future Islands attribute importance to their albums' cover artwork.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://thevinylfactory.com/features/future-islands-far-field-interview-artwork/ | title = Future Islands on the 1" vinyl and enigmatic artwork of The Far Field | author = Anton Spice | date = April 20, 2017 | website =Thevinylfactory.com | publisher = The Vinyl Factory | access-date = April 21, 2017}}</ref> William Cashion stated: "I think having good artwork is a big deal for any record. I think if a record has bad artwork I will just dismiss it, I just won't even give it a chance. I think a lot of people share that opinion, that artwork is very important."<ref name="auto12"/> Future Islands' cover artwork has been delegated to different artists, as Sam Herring explains: "As projects pop up, we decide what artistic styles best speak to the music and the medium, then decide on artists. We primarily choose friends' work, though, people who we've become intimate with as friends. I think that pulls something deeper out of the whole, working with loved ones. You give birth to something bigger than yourself when you involve other people's ideas and minds. That's always a good thing."<ref name="auto14"/>

Kymia Nawabi made the cover art for ''Wave Like Home'', ''Feathers & Hallways (single)'', ''[[In Evening Air]]'', ''Undressed (EP)'', ''[[The Far Field (album)|The Far Field]]''. She is the most recurrent artist  and is based in Brooklyn. She was a band member of the proto-Future Islands band [[Art Lord & the Self-Portraits]]<ref name="auto8"/> and directed the video of "Walking Through that Door" in stop-motion animation. William Cashion commented "Our friend Kymia ... as I said, we write and record in our own world and she kind of makes ... her artwork is definitely in her own world, in a way. The images she uses are all her own. We went to college with her and we've always admired her work and we love working with her. She also did the cover for the new EP and the Feathers & Hallways EP.  We definitely put a lot of weight on the art, and we want to make the albums look as good as they sound."<ref name="auto12"/>

Elena Johnston created the cover art for ''[[On the Water (album)|On the Water]]'', ''Future Islands / Lonnie Walker'' split 7-inch, ''Dream of You and Me'' single. She co-directed with William Cashion the video of "Dream of You and Me" and is the creator of the large canvas seen in the background of the interior scenes of the video "Ran".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-future-islands-panoramic-new-video-for-ran-w469796 | title = Watch Future Islands' Panoramic New Video for 'Ran' | author = Sarah Grant | date = March 1, 2017 |publisher = [[Rolling Stone]] | access-date = April 21, 2017}}</ref><br>
About the ''[[On the Water (album)|On the Water]]'' art cover William Cashion stated: "We decided that we wanted the album art to be loose and abstract for this album ... We wanted washes of color. The cover is actually an excerpt of a painting that Elena had already created."<ref name="auto15"/> In another interview he added "It was great working with her. The piece wasn't made specifically for the album. We chose it from a series of paintings and drawings. She handled most of the typography on the album as well."<ref name="auto14"/>

===Touring===
[[File:Future_Islands,_Kosmonaut_Festival_2015_12.JPG|thumb|260px|Drummer Mike Lowry at the Kosmonaut Festival (2015)]]
Future Islands has performed over 1,000 shows in their first 10 years.<ref name="auto10"/> Since 2013, the band has included a drummer in its tours. In late 2013 and early 2014 it was [[Double Dagger (band)|Double Dagger]]'s former drummer Denny Bowen who had already played drums and percussion on Future Islands albums ''[[In Evening Air]]'', ''[[On the Water (album)|On the Water]]'' and ''[[Singles (Future Islands album)|Singles]]'' among some EPs and singles. In the spring of 2014, due to tour schedule conflicts between Future Islands and his own band [[Roomrunner]], Bowen was replaced by Mike Lowry from Baltimore bands [[Lake Trout (band)|Lake Trout]] and Mt. Royal. Lowry was also part of [[The Far Field (album)|The Far Field]] studio sessions.<ref name="auto17"/>

"Our shows are all about creating a really energetic vibe, a physical thing, and we want more people to move – that's the big thing. We either want them to move, or be moved by the music. It was never weird to us that we didn't have a drummer, but to some people it was – they'd be like: "Where the hell are the drums coming from?"<ref name="auto6" />

Future Islands have opened for [[Morrissey]], [[Grace Jones]], [[Phantogram (band)|Phantogram]], [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]] and [[Okkervil River]].<ref name="CityPaper2011"/> They have performed at festivals such as Latitude, Great Escape, [[Primavera Sound]], Glastonbury, Coachella, Øyafestivalen, Sziget, Bonnaroo, Sasquatch!, and SXSW, among others.
