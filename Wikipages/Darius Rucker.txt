The band released five studio albums with him as a member and charted six top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Rucker co-wrote most of the songs with the other members.

He released a solo [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] album, ''[[Back to Then]]'' in 2002 on [[Hidden Beach Recordings]] but no singles from it charted. Six years later, Rucker signed to [[Capitol Records Nashville|Capitol Nashville]] as a [[country music]] singer, releasing the album, ''[[Learn to Live]]'' that year. Its first single, "[[Don't Think I Don't Think About It]]", made him the first black artist to reach number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts since [[Charley Pride]] in 1983. (Ray Charles hit number one in March 1985 in a duet with Willie Nelson with "[[Seven Spanish Angels]]".) It was followed by two more number one singles, "[[It Won't Be Like This for Long]]" and "[[Alright (Darius Rucker song)|Alright]]" and the number three hit "[[History in the Making (song)|History in the Making]]". In 2009, he became the first black American to win the New Artist Award from the [[Country Music Association]], and the second black person to win any award from the association. A second album, ''[[Charleston, SC 1966]]'', was released on October 12, 2010. The album includes the number one singles, "[[Come Back Song]]" and "[[This (Darius Rucker song)|This]]".

==Hootie & the Blowfish==
Darius Rucker has been the lead singer of [[Hootie & the Blowfish]] since its formation in 1986. He met fellow band members [[Mark Bryan]], Jim "Soni" Sonefeld,<ref name="Puterbaugh" /> and Dean Felber while attending the [[University of South Carolina]]. Bryan first heard Rucker singing in the shower, and the two became a duo, playing [[R.E.M.]] covers at a local venue.<ref name=Kennedy>Kennedy, Dana, Darryl Estrine (July 28, 1995). "Hootie's revenge." ''Entertainment Weekly'' (285):32</ref> They later recruited Felber and finally Sonefeld joined in 1989.<ref name=Kennedy/> As a member of Hootie & the Blowfish, Rucker has recorded six studio albums: ''Cracked Rear View'' – 1994, ''Fairweather Johnson'' – 1996, ''Musical Chairs'' – 1998, ''Scattered, Smothered & Covered'' – 2000, ''Hootie & the Blowfish''  and ''Looking for Lucky'' – 2005, also charting within the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] six times.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=hootie-the-blowfish-p44727/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hootie & the Blowfish chart history|work=Allmusic|access-date=22 November 2010}}</ref> All six albums feature songs that Rucker, Bryan and Felber wrote. As the frontman, Rucker began to be called simply "Hootie" by fans,<ref name=cohen>Cohen, Rich (August 10, 1995), "Southern comfort". ''Rolling Stone'' (714):42</ref> though the band title combines the nicknames of his college friends.<ref name=Gray/> Before his rise to fame, he lived in the basement of the [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]] house at the University of South Carolina, attempting to launch his career through the college bar scene.

Rucker's signature contribution to the band is his baritone voice, which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has called "ingratiating,"<ref>DeCurtis, Anthony, David Wild (May 13, 1999). "Rock + roll." ''Rolling Stone'' (812):60</ref> ''[[TIME]]'' has called "low, gruff, [and] charismatic,"<ref name="Farley" /> and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' has characterized as a "barrelhouse growl."<ref name=browne>Browne, David (April 26, 96), "`Fairweather' report". ''Entertainment Weekly'' (324):55</ref> Rucker said they "flipped" the formula of the all black band with a white frontman, like [[Frank Sinatra]] performing with [[Count Basie]].<ref name=cohen/> Musically, he has sometimes been criticized or spoofed for not being "black enough".<ref name=Kennedy/> ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a sketch of [[Tim Meadows]] playing Rucker leading beer-drinking, white [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in a counter-march to [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s [[Million Man March]].<ref name="Farley" /><ref name=Balwin>Baldwin, Kristen (November 3, 1995), "The week". ''Entertainment Weekly''. (299):54</ref> He also received death threats for singing the Hootie song "Drowning," a protest song against the flying of the [[Confederate flag]] above the South Carolina statehouse.<ref name="Farley" />

Shortly after gaining a measure of fame, Felber and Rucker (who consider themselves best friends) moved into an apartment in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].<ref name=Kennedy/> With Rucker's recognition as the frontman of a successful band came increased opportunities. In October 1995, he was asked to sing the national anthem at the [[World Series]].<ref name=Balwin/> Frank Sinatra invited him to sing at his 80th birthday party; he sang "[[The Lady Is a Tramp]]."<ref>Russell, Lisa, Carolyn Ramsay (December 4, 1995). "Frankly admiring".. ''People''. '''44''' (23):85</ref> That same week, he made a voice cameo in an episode of the sitcom ''[[Friends]]''.<ref name=Balwin/> He also joined [[Nanci Griffith]] on the song "Gulf Coast Highway" for her 1997 album ''[[Blue Roses from the Moons]]'',<ref>Stambler, Lyndon (June 2, 1997), "Blue Roses from the Moons". ''People''., '''47''' (21):32</ref> and sang backing vocals on [[Radney Foster]]'s 1999 album ''[[See What You Want to See]]''.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=See What You Want to See |others=Radney Foster |year=1998 |type=CD insert |publisher=[[Arista Records]] |id= 18833}}</ref> He encouraged [[Atlantic Records]] to agree to a deal with [[Edwin McCain]] and made a guest appearance on McCain's debut album, ''[[Honor Among Thieves (album)|Honor Among Thieves]]''.<ref>Mukherjee, Tiarra, Maggie Murphy (April 19, 1996).
