'''Sweet Trip''' is an [[electronic music|electronic]]/[[experimental rock]] act formed in 1993 in the [[Bay Area]] of [[California]], United States, currently comprising Roberto Burgos and Valerie Cooper. They are known for their dreamy soundscapes and dense production techniques, often blending [[alternative rock]] subgenres with [[intelligent dance music]].

== Background ==
The group was formed in 1993 by producer and songwriter Roberto Burgos when he met former band-member Viet Le at a high school talent show sign-up in the summer 93.<ref name="Sonemic">{{Cite news |last=Taconelli, Jesse |date=December 20, 2020 |title=Sonemic Interview: Sweet Trip |work=Rate Your Music |url=https://rateyourmusic.com/feature/sonemic-interview-sweet-trip/ |access-date=January 20, 2021}}</ref> Since its inception, the band has released four albums with [[Darla Records]]: 1998's ''[[Halica]]'', 2003's ''[[Velocity : Design : Comfort]]'', 2009's ''[[You Will Never Know Why]]'', and 2021's ''[[A Tiny House, In Secret Speeches, Polar Equals]]''.

Label mates Junior Varsity KM &mdash; whom Burgos has done several [[remix]]es for &mdash; have toured with Sweet Trip on several occasions. Other notable outfits Burgos has done remixes for include [[Takako Minekawa]], [[Club 8]] and [[Gnac]].

In 2013, Burgos posted a new song, "Things to Ponder While Falling", on his [[SoundCloud]] account. He referred to it as "Probably the last Sweet Trip song ever"; this was later updated to "*not* the last Sweet Trip song ever".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/wotf/things-to-ponder-while-falling|title=Winter of the Wolf|website=Soundcloud.com|accessdate=July 11, 2013}}</ref>

In 2019, Burgos posted an update to his private [[Twitter]] account, stating: "We've realized that we can't put out a VDC vinyl reissue without following up with new music, and that's an exciting realization."

In 2020, Sweet Trip released their first new song since 2013, "In Sound, We Found Each Other", onto the ''Little Darla Has a Treat for You, Vol. 30'' compilation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Little Darla Has a Treat for You, Vol. 30|url=https://darla.com/products/little-darla-has-a-treat-for-you-vol-30-summer-2020|last=|first=|date=2020-05-13|website=Darla Records|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>
