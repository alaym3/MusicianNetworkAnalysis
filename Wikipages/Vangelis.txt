Vangelis began his career working with several pop bands of the 1960s such as The Forminx and [[Aphrodite's Child]], with the latter's album ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'' going on to be recognized as a [[progressive rock|progressive]]-[[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] rock classic.<ref name="Hischak" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=ac-666 |title=Prog Reviews review of 666 |access-date=4 November 2008 |publisher=Ground & Sky |date=5 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124182400/http://progreviews.com/reviews/display.php?rev=ac-666 |archive-date=24 January 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Throughout the 1970s, Vangelis composed [[film scores|scores]] for several animal documentaries, including ''{{lang|fr|[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des Animaux]]}}'', ''{{lang|fr|[[La Fête sauvage]]}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|[[Opéra sauvage]]}}''; the success of these scores brought him into the film scoring mainstream.

==Career==
===1963–1974: Early solo projects and Aphrodite's Child===
Following the split of The Forminx, Vangelis spent the next two years mostly studio-bound, writing and producing for other Greek artists.<ref name="Blue Point">[http://www.bluepoint.gen.tr/vangelis/more_eng.html Blue Point] Retrieved 11 October 2008</ref> He scored music for three Greek films; ''My Brother, the Traffic Policeman'' (1963) directed by Filippos Fylaktos, ''5,000 Lies'' (1966) by [[Giorgos Konstantinou]] and ''[[Vortex, the Face of Medusa|To Prosopo tis Medousas]]'' (1967) by [[Nikos Koundouros]].

During this time, Vangelis worked on the scores to ''Frenzy'' (1966) for director Jan Christian, ''Apollo Goes on Holiday'' (1968) for George Skalenakis, ''Antique Rally'' (1966), and ''5,000 Lies'' (1968) for [[Giorgos Konstantinou]].

In 1968, the 25-year-old Vangelis wished to further his career and, amidst the political turmoil surrounding the [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|1967 coup]], left Greece for London. However, he was denied entry into the UK and settled in Paris for the next six years.<ref name=KB82/><ref name=MM74>{{cite web|url=http://elsew.com/data/mema74.htm|title=Greek Group|first=Steve|last=Lake|date=10 August 1974|work=Melody Maker|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref> Later in 1968 he formed the [[progressive rock]] band [[Aphrodite's Child]] with [[Demis Roussos]], [[Loukas Sideras]], and [[Silver Koulouris|Anargyros "Silver" Koulouris]].<ref name="Telegraph UK"/> Their debut single, "[[Rain and Tears]]", was a commercial success in Europe which was followed by the albums ''[[End of the World (album)|End of the World]]'' (1968) and ''[[It's Five O'Clock]]'' (1969). Vangelis conceived the idea of their third, ''[[666 (Aphrodite's Child album)|666]]'' (1972), a double concept album based on the [[Book of Revelation]].<ref name="Telegraph UK"/> After increasing tensions during the recording of ''666'', the group split in 1971. Vangelis would produce future albums and singles by their singer [[Demis Roussos]].<ref name="Blue Point"/><ref>[http://www.progarchives.com/artist.asp?id=1171 Prog Archives bio of AC] Retrieved 21 August 2008</ref><ref name="Elsewhere Oor">[http://elsew.com/data/oor76.htm Elsewhere Oor] Retrieved 12 October</ref> Vangelis recalled after the split: "I couldn't follow the commercial way anymore, it was very boring. You have to do something like that in the beginning for showbiz, but after you start doing the same thing everyday you can't continue."<ref name=SOUNDS74/>

From 1970 to 1974, Vangelis took part in various solo projects in film, television, and theatre. He composed the score for ''Sex Power'' (1970) directed by [[Henry Chapier]], followed by ''Salut, Jerusalem'' in 1972 and ''Amore'' in 1974.<ref name="Hischak" /> In 1971, he took part in a series of jam sessions with various musicians in London which resulted in two albums released without Vangelis's permission in 1978: ''[[Hypothesis (album)|Hypothesis]]'' and ''[[The Dragon (Vangelis album)|The Dragon]]''. Vangelis succeeded in taking legal action to have them withdrawn.<ref name="Spin"/> 1972 saw the release of his debut solo album ''[[Fais que ton rêve soit plus long que la nuit]]'', French for ''Make Your Dream Last Longer Than the Night''. It was inspired by the [[May 1968 events in France|1968 French student riots]], after which Vangelis decided to write a "poème symphonique" to express his solidarity with the students,<ref name=MM74/> comprising musical with news snippets and [[protest songs]]; some lyrics were based on graffiti daubed on walls during the riots.<ref name="Nemo1"/><ref>[http://www.vangelismovements.com/faisquetonrevesoitpluslongquelanuit.htm Album review] Retrieved 20 August 2008</ref> A soundtrack album of music that Vangelis performed for a 1970 wildlife documentary series by [[Frédéric Rossif]] was released as [[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|''L'Apocalypse des animaux'']] (1973).<ref name="Nemo1">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v01.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 1 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> Vangelis also provided music for the [[Henry Chapier]] film ''Amore'' (1973).

In 1973, Vangelis released his second solo album ''[[Earth (Vangelis album)|Earth]]'', a percussive-orientated album with various additional musicians including [[Robert Fitoussi]] and Aphrodite's Child bandmate [[Silver Koulouris]].<ref>[http://www.groove.nl/cd/2/20955.html Groove NL reviews] Retrieved 2 September 2008</ref> The line-up performed and released a single entitled "Who" in 1974 under the name Odyssey, including a concert that Vangelis held at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Paris Olympia]] in February 1974.<ref name=SOUNDS74>{{cite web|url=http://elsew.com/data/sounds74.htm|title=Vangelis - Obscure genius|first=Jerry|last=Gilbet|work=Sounds|date=9 March 1974|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref> Several months later Vangelis travelled to England to audition with the progressive rock band [[Yes (band)|Yes]], after singer [[Jon Anderson]] had become a fan of his music and invited Vangelis to replace departing keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]].

===1975–1980: Move to London, breakthrough, and Jon and Vangelis===
In August 1975, after Vangelis had settled in a flat in [[Marble Arch]], London where he set up his new 16-track studio, [[Nemo Studios]], which Vangelis named his "laboratory",<ref name=PROV81/> he secured a recording deal with [[RCA Records]].<ref name=NME75/><ref name=BEAT75>{{cite web|url=http://elsew.com/data/beat75.htm|title=Vangelis' Heaven and Hell|work=Beat Instrumental|date=December 1975|access-date=26 January 2019}}</ref> He would release a series of electronic albums for RCA until 1979;<ref name="Hischak" /> the first, ''[[Heaven and Hell (1975 album)|Heaven and Hell]]'', features the [[English Chamber Choir]] and Yes singer [[Jon Anderson]].<ref name=BEAT75/> Released in December 1975, Vangelis supported it with a sold-out concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in 1976.<ref name="Nemo2">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v02.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 2 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> This was followed by  ''[[Albedo 0.39]]'' (1976), ''[[Spiral (Vangelis album)|Spiral]]'' (1977), ''[[Beaubourg (album)|Beaubourg]]'' (1978) and ''[[China (Vangelis album)|China]]'' (1979), each having their own thematic inspiration including the universe, [[Tao]] philosophy, the [[Centre Georges Pompidou]] and Chinese culture, respectively.<ref name="Nemo2"/><ref name="Nemo3">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v03.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 3 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>

Vangelis provided the score for ''[[Do You Hear the Dogs Barking?]]'' directed by [[François Reichenbach]].  This was released in 1975 and re-released two years later.<ref name="Nemo3"/> In 1976 Vangelis released his second soundtrack for a Rossif animal documentary, ''[[La Fête sauvage]]'', which combined African rhythms with Western music.<ref name="Nemo3"/> This was followed in 1979 by a third soundtrack for Rossif, ''[[Opéra sauvage]]''. Almost as well known as ''[[L'Apocalypse des animaux (album)|L'Apocalypse des animaux]]'', this soundtrack brought him to the attention of some of the world's top filmmakers. The music itself would be re-used in other films, most notably the track "L'Enfant" in ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'' (1982) by [[Peter Weir]]; the melody of the same track (in marching band format) can also be heard at the beginning of the 1924 Summer Olympics opening ceremonies scene in the film ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' while the track "Hymne" was used in [[Barilla Group|Barilla]] pasta commercials in Italy and [[E & J Gallo Winery|Ernest & Julio Gallo]] wine ads in the US.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r83736|pure_url=yes}} All Music review of Opera.] Retrieved 2 September 2008</ref><ref name="Nemo8">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v08.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 8 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> Rossif and Vangelis again collaborated for ''Sauvage et Beau'' (1984)<ref name="Nemo7">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v07.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 7 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref> and ''[[De Nuremberg à Nuremberg]]'' (1989).<ref name="Nemo9">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v09.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 9 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref>

In 1979 Vangelis released the album ''[[Odes (Irene Papas album)|Odes]]'', which included Greek folk songs performed by Vangelis and actress [[Irene Papas]]. It was an instant success in Greece<ref name="Nemo3"/> and was followed by a second collaboration album, ''[[Rapsodies]]'', in 1986.<ref name="Nemo8"/> 1980 saw the release of the experimental and satirical ''[[See You Later]]''.<ref name="Nemo4"/>

In 1979, Vangelis entered a collaboration with Yes singer [[Jon Anderson]] as the duo [[Jon and Vangelis]]. Their debut album, ''[[Short Stories (Jon and Vangelis album)|Short Stories]]'' (1980), reached No. 4 in the UK. They went on to release three more albums; ''[[The Friends of Mr Cairo]]'', ''[[Private Collection (Jon and Vangelis album)|Private Collection]]'' and ''[[Page of Life]]'' released in 1981, 1983, and 1991 respectively.<ref name="Nemo5">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v05.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 5 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="Nemo6">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v06.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 6 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="Nemo10">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v10.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 10 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref>[http://www.connollyco.com/discography/jon_and_vangelis/ Conolly discography of J&V] Retrieved 25 September 2008</ref>

===1981–2002: Mainstream success===
====Film and television====
[[File:London26July2012c.jpg|thumb|upright|Vangelis in 2012 with stars of the stage adaptation of ''[[Chariots of Fire (play)|Chariots of Fire]]'']]
In 1980, Vangelis agreed to record the score for ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'' (1981); he accepted because "I liked the people I was working with. It was a very humble, low-budget film."<ref name=SPIN85/> The choice of music was unorthodox as most period films featured orchestral scores, whereas Vangelis's music was modern and synthesiser-oriented. It gained mainstream commercial success which increased Vangelis's profile as a result. The opening instrumental title piece, "[[Chariots of Fire (instrumental)|Titles]]", later named "Chariots of Fire – Titles", was released as a single which reached No. 1 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart for one week after a five-month climb.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=song|id=t1534846|pure_url=yes}} AMG review of Chariots of Fire] Retrieved 25 September 2008</ref> The [[Chariots of Fire (album)|soundtrack album]] was No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for four weeks and sold one million copies in the US. In March 1982, Vangelis won an [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Music Score|Best Original Music Score]], but refused to attend the awards ceremony<ref name=SPIN85>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/vangelis/interviews/spin85/spin85.htm|title=New sounds|first=John|last=Schaefer|date=June 1985|magazine=Spin|access-date=27 January 2019}}</ref> partly due to his fear of flying. He turned down an offer to stay in a stateroom aboard the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2]]'' for a boat crossing.<ref name=TS82>{{cite news|url=http://vangeliscollector.com/telegraph112182.htm|title=Mechanic of Music|first=Andrew|last=Duncan|date=21 November 1982|newspaper=Telegraph Sunday Magazine|access-date=10 February 2019}}</ref> Vangelis commented that the "main inspiration was the story itself. The rest I did instinctively, without thinking about anything else, other than to express my feelings with the technological means available to me at the time".<ref name="TheGuardian2012"/> The song was used at the [[1984 Winter Olympics]].<ref name="Telegraph UK"/>

The success of ''Chariots of Fire'' led to further offers for Vangelis to score films, but he avoided becoming "a factory of film music".<ref name=SPIN85/> In 1981, he scored the documentary film ''Pablo Picasso Painter'' by [[Frédéric Rossif]]. It was the third such score by Vangelis as he'd previously scored documentaries about [[Georges Mathieu]] and [[Georges Braque]]. In 1982 he composed the score of ''[[Missing (1982 film)|Missing]]'' directed by [[Costa-Gavras]], which was awarded the [[Palme d'Or]] and gained Vangelis a nomination for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music#1982|BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]].<ref name="Nemo5"/> Other Vangelis film soundtracks produced during this time include ''[[Antarctica (Vangelis album)|Antarctica]]'' for the film ''[[Nankyoku Monogatari]]'' in 1983, one of the highest-grossing movies in Japan's film history,<ref name="Nemo6"/> and ''[[The Bounty (1984 film)|The Bounty]]'' in 1984.<ref name="Nemo7"/> He declined an offer to score ''[[2010: The Year We Make Contact]]'' (1984), the sequel to ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.<ref name=SPIN85/>

In 1981, Vangelis collaborated with director [[Ridley Scott]] to score his science fiction film, ''[[Blade Runner]]'' (1982).<ref>[http://bladerunner.nemostudios.co.uk/ Vangelis' Blade Runner film score] Retrieved 12 February 2012</ref> Critics have written that in capturing the isolation and melancholy of [[Harrison Ford]]'s character, Rick Deckard, the Vangelis score is as much a part of the dystopian environment as the decaying buildings and ever-present rain.<ref>[http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2004/02/20/vangelis-blade-runner/ Synthtopia BR review] Retrieved 27 November 2008</ref> The score was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music#1982|BAFTA]] and [[40th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]] award. A disagreement led to Vangelis withholding permission for his recordings to be released, so the studio hired musicians dubbed the [[New American Orchestra]] to release orchestral adaptations of the original score.

==Personal life==
For an artist of his stature, very little is known about Vangelis's personal life and he rarely gives interviews to journalists.<ref name="Spin">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=16jp_aFRHdgC |title=New Sounds |author=John Schaefer |date=June 1985 |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |volume=1 |issue=2 |page=49 |issn=0886-3032}}</ref> However, in a 2005 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Vangelis talked openly about various parts of his life. He stated in the interview that he was "never interested" in the "decadent lifestyle" of his band days, choosing not to use alcohol or other drugs.<ref name="Telegraph UK"/>

Vangelis's place of residence is not publicly known. He has stated that he "travels around", rather than settling in one place or in one country for long.<ref name="Telegraph UK"/>

At the time of the ''Telegraph'' interview, Vangelis was in his third long-term relationship. When asked why he had not had children, Vangelis replied:
{{quote|… Because of the amount of travelling I do and the nonsense of the music business, I couldn't take care of a child in the way I think it should be taken care of.<ref name="Telegraph UK"/>}}
Excerpts from other interviews mention that Vangelis has married twice before.

As a hobby, Vangelis enjoys painting. His first exhibition, of 70 paintings, was held in 2003 at Almudin in [[Valencia]], Spain. It then toured South America until the end of 2004.<ref name="TheGuardian2012"/><ref name="Nemo14">{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/main/vangelis/v14.htm |title=Nemo: Vangelis - chapter 14 |work=nemostudios.co.uk |access-date=18 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vangelismovements.com/vangelispaintings.htm|title=Vangelis Paintings|publisher=Vangelis Movements|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref>

==Musical style and composition==
The musical style of Vangelis is diverse; although he primarily uses [[electronic music instrument]]s, which characterize [[electronic music]], his music has been described as a mixture of [[electronica]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/rediscover-vangelis-see-you-later |title=Rediscover Vangelis' 'See You Later' |date=29 February 2016 |publisher=uDiscover |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> [[classical music|classical]] (his music is often [[symphony|symphonic]]), [[progressive rock]],<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url=http://ambientmusicguide.com/a-z-essential-albums/vangelis/ |title=Vangelis |author=Mike G |work=Ambient Music Guide |publisher=Mike Watson aka Mike G |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> [[jazz music|jazz]] (improvisations),<ref name="Spin"/> [[ambient music|ambient]],<ref name="AMG"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/ambient-in-20-songs |title=Ambient In 20 Songs |date=5 May 2016 |publisher=uDiscover |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> [[Avant-garde music|avant-garde]]/[[experimental music|experimental]],<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="Pitchfork">{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/11110-blade-runner-trilogy-25th-anniversary/ |title=Blade Runner Trilogy: 25th Anniversary |author=Mike Orme |date=7 February 2008 |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> and [[World music|world]].<ref name="Spin"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.udiscovermusic.com.au/rediscover-china |title=Rediscover China |date=30 September 2014 |publisher=uDiscover |access-date=20 August 2016}}</ref> Vangelis is sometimes categorized as a [[New-age music|new-age]] composer,<ref name="Pitchfork"/> a classification others have disputed. Vangelis himself called New-age music a style which "gave the opportunity for untalented people to make very boring music".<ref name="Telegraph UK"/>

As a musician who has always composed and played primarily on keyboards, Vangelis relies heavily on synthesizers<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nemostudios.co.uk/nemo/tour/recording/recording.htm |title=Nemo Studios: Portrait of a studio |access-date=12 June 2010}}</ref> and other electronic approaches to music. However, he also plays and uses many acoustic instruments (including [[folk instrument|folk]]<ref name="Hischak" />) and choirs:

{{quote|I don't always play synthesizers. I play acoustic instruments with the same pleasure. I'm happy when I have unlimited choice; in order to do that, you need everything from simple acoustic sounds to electronic sounds.<ref name="Spin"/> Sound is sound and vibration is vibration, whether from an electronic source or an acoustic instrument.<ref name="TheGuardian2012"/>}}

''Synthtopia'', an electronic music review website, stated that Vangelis's music could be referred to as "symphonic electronica"<ref name="Hischak" /> because of his use of synthesizers in an [[orchestra]]l fashion. The site went on to describe his music as [[melodic]]: "drawing on the melodies of [[folk music]], especially the Greek music of his homeland".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.synthtopia.com/content/2004/01/17/vangelis/ |title=Review of Vangelis |date=17 January 2004 |website=Synthtopia.com |access-date=6 October 2008}}</ref> Vangelis's music and compositions have also been described as "...a distinctive sound with simple, repetitive yet memorable tunes against evocative rhythms and [[chord progressions]]."<ref>[http://www.mfiles.co.uk/composers/Vangelis.htm Mfiles biog.] Retrieved 6 October 2008</ref> His first electric instrument was a [[Hammond organ#Console organs|Hammond B3 organ]], while first synthesizer a [[Korg]] 700 monophonic.<ref name="Goldstein"/> He has often used [[vibrato]] on his synthesizers, which was carried out in a distinctive way on his [[Yamaha CS-80]] polyphonic synthesizer – varying the pressure exerted on the key to produce the expressive vibrato sound. In a 1984 interview Vangelis described the CS-80 as "The most important synthesizer in my career — and for me the best analogue synthesizer design there has ever been."<ref name="Goldstein"/>

In an interview with ''Soundtrack'', a music and film website, Vangelis talked about his compositional processes. For films, Vangelis stated that he would begin composing a [[Film score|score]] for a feature as soon as he sees a rough cut of the footage.<ref>[http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=134 Soundtrack Interview] Retrieved 6 October 2008</ref> In addition to working with synthesizers and other electronic instruments, Vangelis also works with and conducts orchestras. For example, in the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Alexander (2004 film)|Alexander]]'', Vangelis conducted an orchestra that consisted of various [[Orchestra#Instrumentation|classical instruments]] including [[sitars]], percussion, [[finger cymbals]], harps, and [[duduk]]s.<ref>[http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=4610 MFTM review of Alexander] Retrieved 6 October 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080419030600/http://www.musicfromthemovies.com/review.asp?ID=4610 |date=19 April 2008 }}</ref>

{{quote|He explains his customary method of approach. As soon as the musical idea is there, as many keyboards as possible are connected to the control-desk, which in turn are directly connected to the applicable tracks of the multi-track machine.
