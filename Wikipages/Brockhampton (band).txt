'''Brockhampton''' (stylized in [[All Caps|all caps]]) is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] boy band founded in 2010 as AliveSinceForever in [[San Marcos, Texas]].

=== 2010–2014: Formation and AliveSinceForever ===
Although not all of them were a part of the original group, [[Kevin Abstract]], [[Ameer Vann]], Joba, Matt Champion, and Merlyn Wood met as teenagers, as they all attended [[The Woodlands High School]] in [[Woodlands, Texas]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite news|url=https://centralsauce.com/who-is-brockhampton|title=BROCKHAMPTON: Members, Origins, and Music - CentralSauce|date=December 7, 2017|work=CentralSauce|access-date=November 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114230126/https://centralsauce.com/who-is-brockhampton|archive-date=November 14, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2010, Abstract made a post<ref>{{cite web|title=Anybody wanna make a band?|url=http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=51240.0|website=www.kanyetothe.com|access-date=December 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171220131644/http://www.kanyetothe.com/forum/index.php?topic=51240.0|archive-date=December 20, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> on the KanyeLive online forum (now known as KanyeToThe) asking if anyone wanted to form a band, to which over 30 users responded.
