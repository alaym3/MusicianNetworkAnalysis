==Life and career==

===Early years===
Rivers was born as John Henry Ramistella in New York City, of Italian ancestry. His family moved from New York to [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], Louisiana. Influenced by the distinctive [[music of Louisiana|Louisiana musical style]], Rivers began playing guitar at age eight, taught by his father and uncle. While still in junior high school, he started sitting in with a band called [[the Rockets (Dick Holler band)|the Rockets]], led by [[Dick Holler]], who later wrote a number of hit songs, including "[[Abraham, Martin and John]]" and the [[novelty song]], "[[Snoopy vs. the Red Baron (song)|Snoopy vs. the Red Baron]]".<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /><ref name="JR.com" />

Ramistella formed his own band, the Spades, and made his first record at 14, while he was a student at [[Baton Rouge High School]].<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /> Some of their music was recorded on the Suede label as early as 1956.<ref name="poore">Poore, Billy (1998). ''Rockabilly: A Forty-Year Journey'', p. 101. Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|0-7935-9142-2}}.</ref>

On a trip to New York City in 1958, Ramistella met [[Alan Freed]], who advised him to change his name to "Johnny Rivers" after the [[Mississippi River]], which  flows through Baton Rouge.<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /> Freed also helped Rivers gain several recording contracts on the Gone label.<ref name="JR.com" /> From March 1958 to March 1959, Johnny Rivers released three records, including "Baby Come Back" (a non-Christmas version of [[Elvis Presley]]'s "[[Santa Bring My Baby Back (To Me)]]"), none of which sold well.<ref name="LMHOF-JR" />

Rivers returned to Baton Rouge in 1959, and began playing throughout the [[American South]] alongside comedian [[Brother Dave Gardner]]. One evening in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], Rivers met Audrey Williams, [[Hank Williams]]' first wife. She encouraged Rivers to move to  [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], where he found work as a songwriter and demo singer. Rivers also worked alongside [[Roger Miller]]. By this time, Rivers had decided he would never make it as a singer, and song writing became his priority.<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /><ref name="JR.com" />

===1960s===
In 1958, Rivers met fellow Louisianan [[James Burton]], a guitarist in a band led by [[Ricky Nelson]]. Burton later recommended one of Rivers' songs, "I'll Make Believe," to Nelson, who recorded it. They met in Los Angeles in 1961, where Rivers subsequently found work as a songwriter and [[studio musician]]. His big break came in 1963, when he filled in for a jazz combo at [[Gazzarri's]], a nightclub in Hollywood, where his instant popularity drew large crowds.<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /><ref name="JR.com" /><ref name="quisling">Quisling, Erik, and Williams, Austin (2003).

In 1964, [[Elmer Valentine]] gave Rivers a one-year contract to open at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], on [[Sunset Strip]] in [[West Hollywood]].<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /><ref name="quisling" /> The Whisky had been in business just three days when [[the Beatles]] song "[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]" entered the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref name="JR.com" /> The subsequent [[British Invasion]] knocked almost every American artist off the top of the charts, but Rivers was so popular that record producer [[Lou Adler]] decided to issue ''[[At the Whisky à Go Go|Johnny Rivers Live at the Whisky A Go Go]]'',<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /> which reached #12.  Rivers recalled that his most requested live song then was "[[Memphis, Tennessee (song)|Memphis]]",<ref name=pc21>{{Pop Chronicles|21|2}}</ref> which reached #2 on [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cash Box]] on 4–11 July 1964<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/19640704.html |title=Cash box: Top 100 singles 1964 |publisher=[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] Magazine |access-date=2010-10-31}}</ref> and also on the [[Hot 100]] on 11–18 July 1964.  It sold over one million copies and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Rivers was impressed and, much to Presley's chagrin, Rivers recorded and released it, even copying the arrangement.

Rivers continued to record mostly live performances throughout 1964 and 1965, including [[Go-Go dancer|Go-Go-style]] records with songs featuring [[folk music]] and [[blues rock]] influences including "[[Maybellene]]" (another Berry cover), after which came "[[Mountain of Love]]", "[[Midnight Special (song)|Midnight Special]]", "[[The Seventh Son (song)|Seventh Son]]" (written by [[Willie Dixon]]), plus [[Pete Seeger]]'s" [[Where Have All the Flowers Gone?]]", all of which were hits.<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/archives/60s_files/60s.html|title= The 60s Charts|first1=Randy|last1=Price|work= Cash Box Top Singles|publisher= [[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] Magazine|access-date=January 30, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:New Orleans Jazz Fest 2007 Johnny Rivers.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Rivers performing in 2007 at the New Orleans Jazz Fest]]
In 1963, Rivers began working with writers [[P.F. Sloan]] and [[Steve Barri]] on a theme song for the American broadcast of a British television series ''[[Danger Man]]'', starring [[Patrick McGoohan]]. At first Rivers balked at the idea but eventually changed his mind. The American version of the show, titled ''[[Danger Man|Secret Agent]]'', went on the air in the spring of 1965. The theme song was very popular and created public demand for a longer single version. Rivers' recording of "[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]" reached #3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in 1966.<ref>{{cite book |title= Billboard Top 10 Charts, 1958–1997|last= Whitburn|first= Joel|author-link= Joel Whitburn|year= 1998|publisher= Record Research Inc|location= Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin| isbn = 0-89820-126-8 |page= 148}}</ref> It sold one million copies, also winning gold disc status.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

In 1966, Rivers began to record [[ballad]]s that featured background vocalists.  He produced several hits including his own "[[Poor Side of Town]]", which would be his biggest chart hit and his only #1 record. He also started his own record company, [[Soul City Records (American label)|Soul City Records]] which included [[the 5th Dimension]], whose recordings of "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In]]" and "[[Wedding Bell Blues]]" were #1 hits for the new label. In addition, Rivers is credited with giving songwriter [[Jimmy Webb]] a major break when the 5th Dimension recorded his song "[[Up, Up and Away (song)|Up, Up, and Away]]".<ref name="JR.com" /> Rivers also recorded Webb's "[[By the Time I Get to Phoenix]]". It was covered by [[Glen Campbell]], who had a major hit with it.<ref>{{cite web|title=By the Time I Get to Phoenix|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1958|website=Songfacts|access-date=9 January 2015}}</ref>

Rivers continued to record more hits [[Cover version|covering]] other artists, including "[[Baby I Need Your Lovin']]", originally recorded by the [[Four Tops]], and "[[The Tracks of My Tears]]" by [[the Miracles]], both going Top 10 in 1967. In 1968, Rivers put out ''Realization'', a #5 album that included the #14 pop chart single "[[Summer Rain (Johnny Rivers song)|Summer Rain]]", written by a former member of [[The Mugwumps (band)|the Mugwumps]], [[James Hendricks]]. The album included some of the [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] influences of the time, such as the song [[Hey Joe]], with a two minute introduction, and marked a change in Rivers' musical direction, with more [[introspection|introspective]] songs including "Look To Your Soul" and "Going Back to [[Big Sur]]".<ref name="JR-hits.com">{{cite web |url=http://johnnyrivers.com/jr/hits.html |access-date=2010-10-31 |title=Johnny Rivers Hits |publisher=JohnnyRivers.com}}</ref>

===1970s===
[[File:Johnny Rivers 1975.JPG|thumb|left|160px|Rivers on October 11, 1975]]
In the 1970s Rivers continued to record more songs and albums that were successes with [[music critics]], but did not sell well. ''L.A. Reggae'' (1972) reached the LP chart as a result of the #6 hit "[[Rockin' Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu]]," a cover version of the [[Huey "Piano" Smith|Huey "Piano" Smith and the Clowns]] song. The track became Rivers' third million seller, which was acknowledged with the presentation of a gold disc by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (R.I.A.A.) on January 29, 1973.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/> Reviewing ''L.A. Reggae'' in ''[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]'' (1981), [[Robert Christgau]] said, "there are modernization moves, of course—two [[get out the vote|get-out-the-vote]] songs (just what [[George McGovern|George]] needs) plus the mysterious reggae conceit plus a heartfelt if belated antiwar song—but basically this is just Johnny nasalizing on some fine old memories. 'Rockin' Pneumonia' and '[[Knock on Wood (Eddie Floyd song)|Knock on Wood]]' are especially fine."<ref name="CG">{{cite book|last=Christgau|first=Robert|author-link=Robert Christgau|year=1981|title=[[Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies]]|publisher=[[Ticknor & Fields]]|isbn=089919026X|chapter=Consumer Guide '70s: R|chapter-url=https://www.robertchristgau.com/get_chap.php?k=R&bk=70|access-date=March 12, 2019|via=robertchristgau.com}}</ref>

Other Hot 100 top 40 hits from that time period were 1973's "[[Blue Suede Shoes]]" (originally recorded in 1955 by [[Carl Perkins]])<ref name="poore" /> and 1975's "[[Help Me Rhonda]]" (originally a #1 hit for [[the Beach Boys]]), on which [[Brian Wilson]] sang back-up vocals.

Rivers' last Top 10 entry was his 1977 recording of "[[Swayin' to the Music (Slow Dancing)]]," written by [[Jack Tempchin]] and originally released by Funky Kings. Rivers' last Hot 100 entry, also in 1977, was "Curious Mind ([[Um, Um, Um, Um, Um, Um]])," originally released by [[Major Lance]] and written by [[Curtis Mayfield]]. In addition, Rivers recorded the [[Midnight Special (song)|title song]] for the late night concert-influenced TV show ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]]''.<ref name="JR-hits.com" />  Johnny Rivers' career total is 9 Top 10 hits on the [[Hot 100]] and 17 in the Top 40 from 1964 to 1977.  Rivers has sold well over 30 million records.

===1980s to present===

Rivers continued releasing material into the 1980s (e.g., 1980's ''Borrowed Time'' LP), garnering an interview with [[Dick Clark]] on [[American Bandstand]] in 1981,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://phimpha.com/films/Dick-Clark-Interviews-Johnny-Rivers-American-Bandstand-1981|title=Dick Clark Interviews Johnny Rivers - American Bandstand|publisher=phim pha online|date=1981-02-28|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoPMPM9JZ7M|title=Dick Clark Interviews Johnny Rivers - American Bandstand|publisher=AwardsShowNetwork|date=1981-02-28|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref> although his recording career was winding down.  Around this time, Rivers turned to Christianity.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Music of Johnny Rivers|author=Robert Reynolds|publisher=Reynoldsink|date=2016-10-03|isbn=9781365429408|pages=63–66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WDvFDQAAQBAJ&q=%22johnny+rivers%22+christian&pg=PA66|access-date=2019-11-16}}</ref>

Rivers is still touring, however, performing 50 to 60 shows a year.  Increasingly he has returned to the [[blues]] that first inspired him.

In 1998 Rivers reactivated his Soul City Records label and released ''Last Train to Memphis''. In early 2000, Rivers recorded with [[Eric Clapton]], [[Tom Petty]] and [[Paul McCartney]] on a tribute album dedicated to [[Buddy Holly]]'s backup band, [[the Crickets]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simons|first1=Jeff|title=Rivers still on road with electric guitar|url=http://amarillo.com/stories/051100/ent_rivers.shtml#.WORGHPnyt9M|access-date=5 April 2017|work=Amarillo Globe News|date=11 May 2000}}</ref>

Rivers is one of a small number of performers including [[Mariah Carey]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Billy Joel]], [[Pink Floyd]] (from 1975's ''[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd album)|Wish You Were Here]]'' onward), [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] (though under the members' individual names and/or the pseudonym Gelring Limited) and [[Neil Diamond]], who have their names as the [[copyright]] owner on their recordings (most records have the recording company as the named owner of the recording). This development was spearheaded by the [[Bee Gees]] with their $200 million lawsuit against [[RSO Records]], the largest successful lawsuit against a record company by an artist or group.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Marcone|first1=Stephen|title=Managing Your Band: Artist Management : the Ultimate Responsibility|date=2006|publisher=HiMarks|location=Wayne NJ|isbn=978-0965125024|pages=297–98|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rtxsgPj-U-YC&q=rso+records+bee+gees+lawsuit&pg=PA297|access-date=5 April 2017}}</ref>

On June 12, 2009, Johnny Rivers was inducted into the [[Louisiana Music Hall of Fame]].<ref name="LMHOF-JR" /> His name has been suggested many times for induction into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], but he has never been selected. Rivers, however, was a nominee for 2015 induction into America's Pop Music Hall of Fame. <!--shame on them!-->

On April 9, 2017, Rivers performed a song, accompanying himself on acoustic guitar, at the funeral for Chuck Berry, at [[The Pageant]], in [[St. Louis]], Missouri. One of Rivers' biggest and earliest hits was his cover of Berry's "Memphis, Tennessee".
