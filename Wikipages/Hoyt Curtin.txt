==Biography==
Curtin was a native of [[Downey, California]], and had one son, Chris, with his wife Elizabeth.

In the 1950s Curtin was an in-demand composer for TV commercials. He first met [[William Hanna]] and [[Joseph Barbera]] when he worked on a [[Joseph Schlitz Brewing Company|Schlitz]] beer commercial they were producing for [[MGM]] in 1957.

:"About two weeks later they called and had a lyric they read over the phone. Could I write a tune for it? I called back in 5 minutes and sang it to them ... silence ... uh oh, I bombed out ... the next thing I heard was a deal to record it! ''Ruff & Reddy''. At that moment they had quit at MGM and started their own company. All of our first main titles were done in that fashion. ''Huckleberry Hound'', ''Quick Draw McGraw'', etc.".<ref>[http://www.classicjq.com/info/HoytCurtinInterview.shtml Gary Karpinski - email interview with Hoyt Curtin, 1999]</ref>

He was the composer of many of the Hanna-Barbera cartoons' popular theme songs, including ''[[The Flintstones]]'' until 1981, ''[[Top Cat]]'', ''[[The Jetsons]]'', ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]'', ''[[Super Friends]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[The Smurfs (1981 TV series)|The Smurfs]]'', and ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'' and all its spinoffs until 1986. Beginning in 1960, Curtin also composed many of the [[production music|stock tunes]] used as incidental music in the various Hanna-Barbera series, along with the jingle heard underneath Hanna-Barbera's [[closing logo]] in 1979. He also composed two of the tunes heard in the background in 1959's ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'', although he was embarrassed by the film's poor quality. The following year, Curtin was the composer for the animated series ''[[Q.T. Hush]]'', one of the first cartoons to appear in color.

His other credits include the score for the science-fiction film ''[[Mesa of Lost Women]]'' (1953), [[Ed Wood]]'s ''[[Jail Bait (1954 film)|Jail Bait]]'' (1954, as Hoyt Kurtain), ''[[Timber Tramps]]'' (1975), ''[[C.H.O.M.P.S.]]'' (1979), and the music for the 1978 [[Sandy Frank]] cartoon ''[[Battle of the Planets]]'' for which a soundtrack was released in 2000. He also composed and conducted the music for ''Thrillerama Adventure'', a two-projector attempt at replicating [[Cinerama]], in 1955 with a 38-piece orchestra.

In a 1999 interview Curtin said, "My pianist, Jack Cookerly,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.namm.org/library/oral-history/jack-cookerly|title = Jack Cookerly}}</ref> invented the synthesizer as we know it for ''[[Jonny Quest (TV series)|Jonny Quest]]''. It was made of orange crates with a keyboard and thousands of vacuum tubes! A regular jazz band, (of) 4 trumpets, 6 [trom]bones, 5 woodwind doublers, 5-man rhythm section including percussion"; was used to record the music for the Jonny Quest cartoon. The Jonny Quest session was done "...at RCA in Hollywood. [[Alvin Stoller]] or [[Frankie Capp]] usually played drums. I always tried to get the same guys where possible. They were the ones who could swing and read like demons."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classicjq.com/info/HoytCurtinInterview.shtml|title=A Conversation with Hoyt Curtin}}</ref>

==Death==
Curtin died on December 3, 2000, in [[Thousand Oaks, California]], at age 78.<ref name=LATimes/> He was on the tennis court playing a match when he fell to the ground and was pronounced dead by the paramedics.
