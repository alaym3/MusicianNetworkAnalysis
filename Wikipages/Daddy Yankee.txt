[[File:Daddy Yankee vs Don. San Juan, Puerto Rico (Official Q & A) (3,14 segs).png|thumb|Daddy Yankee during an interview in 2015]]
On October 29, 2013, Daddy Yankee released a mixtape entitled "[[El Imperio Nazza: King Edition|King Daddy]]", produced by Los De La Nazza (Musicologo & Menes), as part the ''Imperio Nazza'' Mixtapes series and was released as a digital-format only. The mixtape was made because of the high demand from the fans and is a return to his original reggaeton roots. It includes 11 tracks with collaborations from [[J Alvarez]], [[Arcángel]], [[Yandel]], [[Farruko]], and [[Divino]]. According to Ayala, "King Daddy" was recorded in two and a half weeks, because there was "a lot of inspiration". The song "La Rompe Carros" has garnered popularity among the public, but his hit single was "La Nueva y La Ex" which has been widely received all over South America, Europe, and North America. During a press conference earlier this year, Daddy Yankee announced the physical release of [[King Daddy]] scheduled for later this year with 3 or 4 bonus tracks for a total of 14 or 15 songs included.

From May 13 to June 22, 2014, Ayala performed on his ''King Daddy Tour'', touring several cities in Europe. He has also toured in South and North American cities. In Spain, his concerts were on the 4º position in the box-office ranking, being the first Latin artist on the top 5 in this country, underneath [[Iron Maiden]] and [[The Rolling Stones]], and over artists like [[Beyoncé]], [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Michael Bublé]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.ipauta.com/daddy-yankee-entre-los-conciertos-mas-taquilleros-de-espana/| title=Daddy Yankee entre los conciertos más taquilleros de España| publisher=iPauta| language=es| access-date=July 30, 2014}}</ref>

Daddy Yankee expressed that all music has something good to give, even urban music. On his single, he also says that urban music saves lives, like his own, and the solution would be that churches have to remain, journalists have to tell the truth, artists have to have more inspiration, and the rich people have to help the poor ones.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKNhZZkRmfk| title=Daddy Yankee's 'Palabras Con Sentido' single| publisher=YouTube| language=es| access-date=September 4, 2014}}</ref> On September 9, 2014 he released his first totally English single called "This Is Not A Love Song" featuring new rapper Duncan.

Daddy Yankee's third studio album ''[[Barrio Fino]]'' (2004) ushered reggaeton into the mainstream. Its single "[[Gasolina]]" "[altered] the business, sound and aesthetic of Latin music", stated ''Billboard'', "the genre would revive sales of Latin music, usher in a new radio format in the U.S. ([[Latin Rhythm Airplay]]) and establish the urban base responsible for many Latin radio hits today." According to Nestor Casonú, president for [[Kobalt Music Group|Kobalt Music]] Latin America, "Daddy Yankee and 'Gasolina' triggered the explosion of urban Latin music worldwide."<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=How Daddy Yankee and 'Barrio Fino' Redefined Latin Music|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/8525650/daddy-yankee-barrio-fino-15-year-anniversary|access-date=|work=Billboard}}</ref>

In 2006, a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article deemed him "The King of Reggaetón" while commenting on 2004's music revenue, "one bright spot for the music industry was Latin music: sales grew by 12 percent, according to [[Nielsen SoundScan]].
