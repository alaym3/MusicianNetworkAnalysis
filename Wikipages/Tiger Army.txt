==History==
Tiger Army played their first show at the famous [[924 Gilman Street]] venue in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], California on March 29, 1996.<ref name="Tiger Army">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/tigerarmy/photos/a.65366381378.75359.51627926378/10152849838736379/?type=3&theater |title=Tiger Army |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2015-03-29}}</ref> The band's sound drew from early punk, rock n' roll and rockabilly, as well as dark English pop. Their first official release was a self-titled [[vinyl record]] [[Extended play|EP]], now referred to as the ''Temptation EP''. The record was released by Chapter 11 Records. This EP caught the attention of [[Tim Armstrong]] of [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]]; he was also co-owner of [[Hellcat Records]]. Armstrong signed the band.

Tiger Army recorded their first full-length, the self-titled ''[[Tiger Army (album)|Tiger Army]]'', in January 1999. It was released that October. Stand-up bassist [[Joel Day]] left Tiger Army before the band was signed, so the [[The Quakes|Quakes]] stand-up bassist Rob Peltier was hired to play on the album. Drummer [[Adam Carson]] of [[AFI (band)|AFI]], who had been helping out the band live, played on the record, as well. The band then embarked on a California mini-tour promoting the album in 1999. In 2000, [[Nick 13]] asked former AFI bassist [[Geoff Kresge]], one of his former bandmates from Influence 13, to join Tiger Army. Ex-[[Samhain (band)|Samhain]] drummer [[London May]] came on board as well.

''[[Tiger Army II: Power of Moonlite]]'' followed in 2001. Fred Hell replaced London May shortly after the recording. The band toured with [[TSOL]], [[The Damned (band)|The Damned]], [[Dropkick Murphys]] and others in support of the record and went to Europe and Japan for the first time on the album as well. The band's friend and drum tech, [[Mike Fasano (musician)|Mike Fasano]], played on the next Tiger Army album, ''[[Tiger Army III: Ghost Tigers Rise]],'' when Hell was unable to record or tour behind the album. Nick 13 announced a new line-up for Tiger Army, featuring drummer James Meza and stand-up bassist, Jeff Roffredo, formerly of Los Angeles psychobilly bands Cosmic Voodoo, Calavera, and The Rezurex in 2004. This lineup supported [[Social Distortion]] on an extensive US tour.

In the spring of 2005, the band headlined a string of five sold-out shows at the Hollywood House Of Blues. The following year, the band sold out four nights at the Anaheim House of Blues. They also hit the road with [[Morrissey]] and AFI, performing several headlining tours around the world.
