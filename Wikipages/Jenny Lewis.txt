==Music==
=== Rilo Kiley ===
In 1998, Lewis and friends [[Pierre De Reeder]], [[Dave Rock]] and then-boyfriend [[Blake Sennett]] formed the band [[Rilo Kiley]].  (Rock was eventually replaced by [[Jason Boesel]].) In an interview with [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Songs Considered]]'', Lewis remarked that she wanted to name the group Love's Way (after her parents' [[Lounge music|lounge]] act in Las Vegas), but Sennett "didn't go for it."<ref name="npr_blue">{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6254742|title=The Blue-Eyed Soul of Jenny Lewis|date=2006-10-16|publisher=NPR|access-date=2009-05-21}}</ref> Originally asked to sing back-up vocals by Sennett, Lewis refused to join the band unless she was able to sing lead vocals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Saroyan|first1=Strawberry|title=Solid Gold|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCQFHMhVuA8C&q=spin+rilo+kiley+feature&pg=PA16|publisher=SPIN Magazine|access-date=November 17, 2014|date=September 2007}}</ref>

Beginning with a country sound, Rilo Kiley gravitated toward a downbeat [[indie rock]] sound, gaining the attention of [[Warner Bros.]], who signed the band for the release (via its own imprint, Brute/Beaute Records) of their 2004 album ''[[More Adventurous]],'' which gained the band some success. Critics such as ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' attributed this to the "wise" decision to emphasize Lewis's voice and presence more so than in previous albums.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=August 15, 2004 |first=Chris |last=Dahlen |title=Rilo Kiley ''More Adventurous'' > Review |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/reviews/albums/6789-more-adventurous/ |access-date=3 June 2008 }}</ref> The song "[[Portions for Foxes]]" was a hit. Rilo Kiley's 2007 album ''[[Under the Blacklight]]'' was released directly by [[Warner Bros.]]

In 2011, Sennett hinted that Rilo Kiley had disbanded.<ref>{{cite magazine|last1=Fitzmaurice|first1=Larry|title=Rilo Kiley Seem to Have Broken Up |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/43183-rilo-kiley-seem-to-have-broken-up/|magazine=Pitchfork.com|access-date=30 July 2016}}</ref> Lewis confirmed the band's split in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/30/national-post-sessions-jenny-lewis-on-flying-solo-feminism-and-her-playful-single-one-of-the-guys/|title=Jenny Lewis talks breaking up the band, messaging Ryan Adams on Twitter and dealing with insomnia|newspaper=[[National Post]]|location=Canada|date=2014-07-30|access-date=2014-07-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140806184422/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2014/07/30/national-post-sessions-jenny-lewis-on-flying-solo-feminism-and-her-playful-single-one-of-the-guys/|archive-date=2014-08-06}}</ref>

A retrospective of Lewis's career by Jessica Roy in 2016 commented that Lewis was a style icon to music-loving young people in the 2000s. Roy commented:

<blockquote>For a particular brand of suburban girl who fancied herself cooler than her peers, Jenny was a fire-haired figure of worship. With her endless supply of cool sunglasses, vintage dresses, and hats ... she was a beacon of hope for introspective teens ... as a microgenerational sad-girl touchstone, many of us have our own Jenny Lewis Anecdote, our lives touched by her magnificent tweeness in different ways.<ref name="How Jenny Lewis Was a Twee Teen's Dream">{{cite magazine|last1=Roy|first1=Jessica|title=I Like That Bitch's Life: How Jenny Lewis Was a Twee Teen's Dream|url=http://nymag.com/thecut/2016/01/jenny-lewis-was-a-twee-teens-dream.html|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|access-date=March 28, 2016}}</ref></blockquote>
