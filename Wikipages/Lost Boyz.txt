==History==
In 1995, the group released their debut single "Lifestyles of the Rich & Shameless", charting on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The release landed them a record deal with [[Uptown Records]]. They contributed a single to the ''[[Don't Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood]]'' soundtrack, titled "[[Renee (song)|Renee]]". The song became a major hit, breaking into the Top 40 on the Hot 100 chart. The single also reached Gold status in 1996. On June 4, 1996, the group released their debut album ''[[Legal Drug Money]]''. The work was highly acclaimed,{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}} and featured five Hot 100 hits, including their past singles "Lifestyles of the Rich & Shameless", "Renee", "Music Makes Me High", "Jeeps, Lex Coups, Bimaz & Benz", and "Get Up". The album was certified [[Music recording certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in late 1996.

Their second album, ''[[Love, Peace & Nappiness]]'', was released on June 17, 1997 through [[Uptown Records|Uptown]]/[[Universal Records]]. It featured another Hot 100 single, "Me & My Crazy World". One of the most famous songs on the album was the [[posse cut]] "Beasts from the East", featuring [[A+ (rapper)|A+]], [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], and [[Canibus]]. The album was not as acclaimed as their debut, but fared well commercially, reaching Gold status in late 1997.

In 1996, the group appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s compilation CD ''[[America Is Dying Slowly]]'', alongside [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Coolio]], and [[Fat Joe]], among others. The CD, meant to raise awareness of the AIDS epidemic among African-American men, was heralded as "a masterpiece" by [[The Source]] magazine.{{Citation needed|date=August 2020}}

On the night of March 28, 1999, at a birthday party for Mr. Cheeks, Freaky Tah was shot in the head while exiting the Sheraton Hotel in Queens. Tah was taken to [[Jamaica Hospital Medical Center]] where he was pronounced dead at 4:20 am, aged 27. The [[crime scene getaway|getaway driver]], Raheem Fletcher, was sentenced to seven years in prison for manslaughter. In 2001, Kelvin Jones pleaded guilty to the murder. The three remaining group members finished their third album, ''[[LB IV Life]]'', released in September 1999. The effort fell short critically and commercially, failing to provide any Hot 100 hits, and failing to reach Gold status. These circumstances led Mr. Cheeks to begin a solo career. He released his first solo effort ''John P. Kelly'' in 2001, which featured the hit single "Lights, Camera, Action!". The album also featured a tribute song to Freaky Tah titled "Till We Meet Again", featuring [[Bob Marley]]'s son [[Stephen Marley (musician)|Stephen]]. Cheeks released another album in 2003, titled ''Back Again!'', then followed in 2004 with ''Ladies & Ghettomen''. On January 16, 2004, Spigg Nice was tried and convicted of multiple bank robberies in [[New Jersey]] and was sentenced to 37 years in prison.<ref>http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=2798 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060321175911/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=2798 |date=March 21, 2006 }}</ref> On July 14, 2021, Spigg Nice was released from federal prison after 17 years in prison. The group released a compilation album ''[[Lost Boyz Forever]]'' in 2005, featuring past hits and previously unreleased material.
