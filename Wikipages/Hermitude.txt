'''Hermitude''' is an Australian [[Electronic music|electronic]] [[Australian hip hop|hip hop]] duo, originating from the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], [[New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hermitude |url=http://www.localnoise.net.au/site-directory/interviews/hermitude-interview/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203120033/http://www.localnoise.net.au/site-directory/interviews/hermitude-interview/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 December 2007 |publisher=Local Noise |access-date=4 October 2012 |author=Tony Mitchell |year=2007–2012 }}</ref>

==Biography==
===Early years and ''Explanetary''===
Multi-instrumentalists, Luke Dubber (a.k.a. Luke Dubs) and Angus Stuart (a.k.a. El Gusto), have collaborated in bands since 1994, when they were aged 16 and 11, respectively. Their first functional band was called "Funk Injections" and included Stuart's sister, Aja Stuart, on bass.

When a group of local rappers, including Tim Levinson (a.k.a. [[Urthboy]]) from [[The Herd (Australian band)|the Herd]], were impressed by Funk Injections' abilities, the two groups briefly incorporated in 1998, performing for a while under the name "Explanetary".<ref name="Noise">{{cite web|url=http://www.localnoise.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/hermitude.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720195054/http://www.localnoise.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/hermitude.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=20 July 2008|title=Hermitude |publisher=Localnoise.net.au |date=14 April 2006 |access-date=7 April 2008 }}</ref> Explanetary consisted of Levinson on vocals, Dubber on keyboards, Stuart on drums, Realfatix on vocals (and sometimes production), No Mumbles (a.k.a. Nug) on vocals, Aja Stuart (Stuart's sister) on bass and DJ ALF on cuts.<ref>[http://www.elefanttraks.com/chooser.cfm?view=artists&artistId=5 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720133338/http://www.elefanttraks.com/chooser.cfm?view=artists&artistId=5 |date=20 July 2008 }}</ref> Explanetary only released one EP, ''In on the Deal'', in July 2001<ref>[http://chaos.com/product/in_on_the_deal_189657_61944.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080927042910/http://chaos.com/product/in_on_the_deal_189657_61944.html |date=27 September 2008 }}</ref> following which the members went their separate ways.

===2000-2009: Career beginnings of Hermitude===
After Stuart returned from a trip to the US in 2000 with a set of turntables, the two tried jamming together with Dubs playing keyboard, sans vocals. The combination worked so well that they realised they didn't need anything else, and Hermitude was formed.

Signing with the [[Elefant Traks]] label, founded by The Herd, Hermitude released the vinyl-only ''Imaginary Friends'' EP in 2002.<ref>Hobart Mercury, 30 October 2008, "New kids on hip-hop block"</ref> The collection of esoteric instrumental soundscapes, with two vocal cuts provided by Urthboy and Ozi Batla, sold out and has never been transferred to CD, making it a collector's item. In 2003, the band released their first album, ''[[Alleys to Valleys]]''. The name referred to their moving between [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]] and a recording studio called Sound Heaven in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]], owned by Stuart's father, John Stuart, which allowed them to live like [[hermit crab]]s [[half]] the [[time]]. The other half of their time they spent coming down from the mountains to try out their new material in the clubs of the city.

The popularity of Hermitude's debut allowed them to earn support billing with touring international acts such as, [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[RJD2]], and [[DJ Krush]], and then record ''Tales of the Drift'' in 2005. A more percussive, Cuban sound was created, inspired by Stuart's time spent there in his youth.<ref name="Noise" /> In 2006 Hermitude embarked overseas to pursue bigger success, landing gigs in Europe, Asia and the US.<ref>''The Malay Mail'', 5 April 2006, "Hermitude with attitude" by Tan Hee Hui</ref><ref>''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 12 May 2006, "Brandy snaps" by Paris Pompor</ref><ref>''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 April 2006, News</ref> They were invited to perform in [[Malaysia]],<ref name="Mix">{{cite web |url=http://www.inthemix.com.au/features/31780/Hermitude_Monocles_and_bootyshakin|publisher=Inthemix.com |title=Hermitude: Monocles and booty-shakin' |date=18 April 2007 |access-date=7 April 2008}}</ref> [[Norway]]<ref name="Mix" /> and [[Spain]] as well as at [[DJ Kentaro]]'s [[Japan]]ese album launch,<ref name="Mix" /> and were booked for [[Aceyalone]] and [[Abstract Rude]]'s West Coast US tour. Whilst on this world tour, Dubber and Stuart wrote the tunes that would make up their 2007 EP, ''Rare Sightings''. Released in November 2007, initially sold at venues on their return tour of Australia, it was their fourth release on Elefant Traks. Hermitude then joined Urthboy and The Tongue on a national tour throughout Australia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/10621/Three-Strikes-Tour-Hermitude-Earthboy-and-The-Tongue.htm|publisher=Fasterlouder.com |title=Three Strikes Tour |date=7 September 2007 |access-date=7 April 2008}}</ref> Copies of the CD sold out during the tour and had to go back to press before copies could be released in stores.

===2010-2017: ''HyperParadise'' & ''Dark Night Sweet Light''===
In 2010, Hermitude released the single, "Get in My Life" and in 2011 "Speak of the Devil", from the album ''[[HyperParadise]]'', which was released on 3 February 2012.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elefanttraks.com/hermitude|publisher=Elefantraks.com |title=Hermitude |date=30 November 2011 |access-date=2011-11-11}}</ref> The title track of the album peaked at number 38 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Singles Chart]] in February 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Hermitude&titel=HyperParadise&cat=s |title=australian-charts.com - Hermitude - HyperParadise |publisher=Hung Medien |access-date=2015-05-02 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124123534/http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Hermitude&titel=HyperParadise&cat=s |archive-date=24 January 2016}}</ref> "Speak of the Devil" won the 2011 [[Triple J|J Award]] for Music Video of the Year.<ref name="J Award for Music Video of the Year">{{cite web|title=J Awards 2011|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/jawards/11/|work=Triple J|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=25 January 2012|date=November 2011}}</ref>

In 2014 they released the single "Ukiyo" without radio or video servicing, yet in a few months it had millions of plays. In October of that year Hermitude toured North America for the first time, supporting [[Rüfüs Du Sol]].

In January 2015, "Through the Roof", the first official single from the new album ''Dark Night Sweet Light''. The album was released in May 2015 and peaked at number 1 on the ARIA Charts. The album spawned four other singles, including "The Buzz" featuring Mataya and Young Tapz which peaked at number 20, becoming Hermitude's highest-charting song.

In 2016, "Vibration"/"Gimme" was released, two tracks recorded for, but ultimately omitted from ''Dark Night Sweet Light''.

===2018-present: ''Pollyanarchy''===
In November 2018, Hermitude released "Studid World" the first single from a forthcoming album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/hermitude-new-song-stupid-world-ft-bibi-bourelly-interview/10456296|title=First Spin: Hermitude are back with new burner 'Stupid World'|last=Newstead|first=Al|date=1 November 2018|website=triple j|language=en|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref> Hermitude said the song was written in response to the craziness happening globally, whether it be politically or societally, saying "However you wanna deal with what's happening around us in the world right now, you can do it your own way through music."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.elefanttraks.com/artists/hermitude/|title=Hermitude Music Available Though Elefant Traks Now|website=Elefant Traks|access-date=15 February 2019}}</ref>

In September 2019, Hermitude released their sixth studio album, ''Pollyanarchy'', which peaked at number 18 on the ARIA Charts.

==Other projects==
Apart from Hermitude, Stuart has spent the last couple of years playing and touring with [[Paul Mac]] as percussionist and DJ, whilst Dubber has lent his keyboard skills to many local Sydney outfits including Gauche, [[The Tango Saloon]] and The Bird, as well as touring with Tom Tom Crew the internationally acclaimed Hip-Hop Circus stage production.
