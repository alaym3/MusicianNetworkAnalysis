The '''International Students of History Association''' ('''ISHA''') is an international [[non-governmental organization]] of students of history. Based and active mainly in [[Europe]], ISHA's goals are to facilitate communication and provide a platform of exchange for students of history and related sciences on an international level.<ref>http://www.isha-international.org/About</ref>

ISHA was founded in [[Budapest]] in May 1990 thanks to the initiative of Hungarian history students who, after [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]], wanted to forge links with their colleagues in [[Western Europe]]. At present, ISHA's members include more than 25 sections in fifteen European countries, and a number of observers and associate members, while ISHA is itself an associate member of the [[European Students' Union]] (ESU). Moreover, ISHA closely cooperates with a number of other academic networks, among them the [[European History Network]] and [[EUROCLIO]], the European Association of History Educators.<ref>http://www.cliohworld.net/</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php/partners/organisations-browse-our-partners |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140708171107/http://www.euroclio.eu/new/index.php/partners/organisations-browse-our-partners |archivedate=2014-07-08 }}</ref>

== Activities ==

Throughout the academic year, the various member sections take turns organizing several seminars and an Annual Conference. These events usually last five to seven days and take place with thirty to fifty (in case of the Annual Conference, up to a hundred) student participants from around Europe. They comprise workshops, discussions, lectures and presentations on varying topics, but also offer a cultural programme with visits and excursions. Additional leisure and evening activities are meant to provide more informal opportunities for participants to meet one another and thereby broaden their intercultural understandings.<ref>http://www.isha-international.org/About</ref>

In 2009-10, ISHA took part in the project "Connecting Europe through History – Experiences and Perceptions of Migration in Europe", together with EUROCLIO and The [[Europaeum]], an organization of ten leading European universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.euroclio.eu/site/index.php/overview-connecting-europe-306 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812120601/http://www.euroclio.eu/site/index.php/overview-connecting-europe-306 |archivedate=2010-08-12 }}</ref>

In 2016-17, ISHA took part in the EU-funded project "Learning a History that is 'not yet History'", together with EUROCLIO and several other partners. The final event (a public debate) took place in the newly opened [[House of European History]] in Brussels.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.euroclio.eu/project/learning-a-history-that-is-not-yet-history/ |title=Learning a History that is 'not yet History' }}</ref>

Since 1999, ISHA publishes its own journal, ''Carnival'', in which students can publish articles of their own. ''Carnival'' is a yearly publication and is open to contributions from all students of history and related sciences (not only ISHA members).<ref>http://www.isha-international.org/Files/Carnival</ref>

== Structure ==
The organs of ISHA are:
* The '''''General Assembly''''' (GA in short), who acts like the parliament of the association. It consists of Active and Passive Members, but only the former have the right to vote. Active Members can vote via one Delegate of their own section, or by giving one Proxy Vote to a Delegate of another section. The GA decides on the association's policies, the modification of Statutes and Standing Orders, and on the Annual Conference it elects the Officials for the next term.
* The '''''International Board''''' (IB in short) is ISHA's executive body. It is composed by five members: President, Secretary, Treasurer and two Vice-Presidents (or one Vice-President and one Vice-Secretary), who apply the guidelines decreed by the General Assembly.
* The '''''Council''''' represents the main aid of the Board in accomplishing the tasks necessary for the functioning of ISHA.
* The '''''Archivist''''' is responsible for maintaining and updating the ISHA Archives. Apart from a digitalised version, some parts of the ISHA Archives are physically available for consultation in the Artes - Ladeuze University Library of the [[KU Leuven]], located on the [[Ladeuzeplein]] in Leuven.
* The '''''Editor-in-Chief''''' is the head of the Editorial Board, which is responsible for issuing ''Carnival'', the academic journal of the association.
* The '''''Webmaster''''' has the task of keeping the ISHA website and social media accounts up-to-date.
* The '''''Treasury Supervision''''' consists of two members and has the main task of checking the outgoing treasurer's work at the end of his/her term.
* The '''''Committees''''' consist of an appointed Spokesperson (usually one of the Council Members) and at least one more member, plus several volunteers. Any Official, Active Member or Passive Member of ISHA can become part of the committees and attend the committee meetings. The Committees help the Officials in giving shape to the ideas and policies of ISHA. Currently, there are five thematic Committees:
** The ''Alumni & PhD Network Committee''
** The ''Fundraising Committee''
** The ''Project Management Committee''
** The ''Public Relations Committee''
** The ''Training Committee''
