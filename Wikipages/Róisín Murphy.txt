Her second solo album, ''[[Overpowered]]'', was released in 2007.

After an eight-year hiatus{{emdash}}which was sporadically interrupted by non-album singles, side projects, and guest appearances on other artists' records{{emdash}}Murphy released her third solo album ''[[Hairless Toys]]'' in 2015; it was nominated for the [[Mercury Music Prize]] and Ireland's [[Choice Music Prize]].

In 2019, Murphy released the disco-inspired single "Incapable". Three additional singles were released up until she announced her fifth solo album, ''[[Róisín Machine]]''. Released in 2020, the album included previously released singles dating from 2012 until 2020, as well as new material. It received critical acclaim and became her most commercially successful album.

==Career==
===1994–2003: Moloko===
[[File:Image-Roisin Murphy Orange Music Haifa 2005 01.jpg|thumb|200px|Murphy performing in [[Haifa]] in 2005]]
Murphy met [[Mark Brydon]] in 1994 at a party, using the chat-up line "Do you like my tight sweater?  See how it fits my body."<ref name="AllM">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/moloko-mn0000487614/biography|work=[[AllMusic]]|last=Phares|first=Heather|title=Moloko Biography|access-date=November 10, 2014}}</ref> Brydon brought Murphy to his Fon Studios, where he auditioned her voice on tape, and liked Murphy's theatrical delivery.  They began dating, and the newly formed Moloko were signed to [[Echo Records]], releasing their debut album ''[[Do You Like My Tight Sweater?]]'' the following year.<ref name="Ind170605"/> The album was described by Heather Phares of [[AllMusic]] as combining elements of [[trip hop]] and [[funk]] with [[electronic dance]] music, using a more humorous approach than some of their contemporaries.<ref name="AllM"/> The follow-up ''[[I Am Not a Doctor]]'' covered similar musical ground,<ref name="AllM"/> and a remix by [[Boris Dlugosch]] of "[[Sing It Back]]" enjoyed international success, and would go on to be featured on more than 110 compilation albums.<ref name="ScM071007"/> In place of paying Dlugosch, Murphy helped write "Never Enough",<ref name="Tel260501">Smyth, David; [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/4723748/A-dose-of-his-own-medicine.html "A dose of his own medicine"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 26 May 2001.

October 2000 saw the release of Moloko's third album ''[[Things to Make and Do]]'', for which they employed more live instrumentation, and more multifaceted arrangements by keyboardist Eddie Stevens.<ref name="PopM270706">[https://www.popmatters.com/pm/music/reviews/3379/moloko-catalogue/ "Moloko: Catalogue"] [[PopMatters]], 27 July 2006. Retrieved 22 July 2009.</ref> The album reached number three on the [[UK Albums Chart]], and "The Time Is Now" became their most successful British single, reaching number two.<ref name="EvHit"/> Murphy and Brydon broke up but were contractually obligated to deliver further albums.  After the 2003 release of ''[[Statues (album)|Statues]]'', Brydon backed out of much of the album's promotion, so Murphy handled most of it herself.<ref name="Guard270505"/>

Although no official statement was issued pertaining to Moloko's future, Murphy told ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine in May 2005, "We left it on good terms after a very successful tour. We shook hands, said "see you later", and haven't spoken since. I don't know what Mark thinks of this record or what he's doing. I don't know if we will or we won't reunite. Myself, I don't ''not'' want to."

===2004–2005: ''Ruby Blue''===

{{main|Ruby Blue (album)}}
Murphy began doing solo work while still in Moloko, which included her contributions to the works of other artists including [[Handsome Boy Modeling School]] and [[Boris Dlugosch]], for whom she sang on the track "Never Enough", which became a huge club hit, hitting the top three of the US [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Club Play]] chart.

Murphy recorded her first official solo material in 2004 with producer [[Matthew Herbert]], who had previously done remixes for Moloko. She had wanted to work with him again, commenting that "it felt very natural... because Matthew makes things seem quicker and easier."<ref name="snc">Bankole, Ade.

''Straight No Chaser''. February 2005. Retrieved 8 October 2007.</ref> After the pair had recorded a few songs, Murphy found that she enjoyed working with Herbert, and her label [[Echo Records]] let her work freely without any deadline. When she presented them the album, they found it odd and did not hear any songs that would make successful singles. The [[A&R]] division suggested that Murphy make some changes to make it more radio-friendly. Murphy refused, stating that she "wanted it to be as pure as possible." The label later came to support her.<ref name="Ind170605" />

Murphy released her debut album ''[[Ruby Blue (album)|Ruby Blue]]'' in June 2005. Prior to this, tracks from the album were made available on three limited edition, vinyl-only releases: ''[[Sequins 1|Sequins #1]]'', ''[[Sequins 2|Sequins #2]]'' and ''[[Sequins 3|Sequins #3]]''. The release of the EP's was to precede a London exhibition by artist Simon Henwood, featuring paintings of Murphy in various sequined outfits (some of Henwood's paintings are used as cover images for the record jackets).<ref name="SimHen">[http://www.simonhenwood.com/flash/#/archive/roisin-murphy-video/ "Roisin Murphy Video"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207000201/http://www.simonhenwood.com/flash/ |date=7 December 2008 }}.
