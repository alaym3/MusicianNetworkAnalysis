'''Duster''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band consisting of multi-instrumentalists Clay Parton, Canaan Dove Amber, and Jason Albertini from [[San Jose, California]]. Albertini played drums on three tracks for their debut album, 1998's ''[[Stratosphere (Duster album)|Stratosphere]]'', and with 1999's ''1975'' [[extended play|EP]], became much more involved in the group process, playing many more instruments and sharing recording/producing credits with Parton and Amber.  By 2000's ''[[Contemporary Movement]]'' he was fully involved in the creative process as a permanent member of the group. Members of the band previously performed together in the group [[Mohinder (band)|Mohinder]], as well as releasing two albums under the name Valium Aggelein.<ref name="TMT">{{cite web |last1=Friesen |first1=David (2012-01-25) |title=Duster - Stratosphere Review |url=https://www.tinymixtapes.com/delorean/duster-stratosphere |website=tinymixtapes.com |publisher=Tiny Mix Tapes |accessdate=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Richardson |first=Mark (2010-11-19) |title=Resonant Frequency |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/resonant-frequency/7902-resonant-frequency-75/ |website=pitchfork.com |publisher=Pitchfork |accessdate=2019-07-20}}</ref>

Parton also tinkers with his side project Eiafuawn and plays drums and tours with [[punk rock|punk]] band El Buzzard. Albertini has his own band  [[Helvetia (band)|Helvetia]] that has put out multiple records on Parton's record label The Static Cult Label and plays keyboards/drums with Mike Johnson.<ref name="Vice">{{cite web |last1=Coney |first1=Brian (2018-08-27) |title=The Slow Return of Duster, the Lo-Fi Trio Who Secretly Changed Indie Rock |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/qvm9nv/duster-interview-new-ep-numero-group-set |website=noisey.vice.com |publisher=Vice |accessdate=2019-03-29}}</ref>  Parton and Amber also run the Low Earth Orbit [[recording studio]].

On April 13, 2018, Duster posted via their [[Instagram]] page that they are “recording a little bit”.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Arcand |first1=Rob |title=Duster Are Back in the Studio for the First Time in 18 Years |url=https://www.spin.com/2018/04/duster-are-back-in-the-studio-for-the-first-time-in-18-years/ |website=Spin |accessdate=18 July 2018}}</ref> Later it was announced that the band's discography would be reissued as the box set ''Capsule Losing Contact'' through [[The Numero Group]],<ref name="p4k 2">{{cite web |last1=Yoo |first1=Noah (2019-01-15) |title=Duster Announce Complete Box Set, Share Unreleased Track: Listen |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/duster-announce-complete-box-set-share-unreleased-track-listen/ |website=pitchfork.com |publisher=Pitchfork Media |accessdate=2019-03-29}}</ref> which was released on March 22, 2019.

Of their hiatus and subsequent reunion, Parton said, "When we took a break almost two decades ago, we didn't think it was going to all completely stop. We thought we could keep it drifting at least, maybe at a slower pace and with a different process. But everything just went dark. We were always in touch and sometimes we'd talk about doing Duster things, but days just piled up... In recent years we've talked more seriously about at least doing another record. Now everything is sort of working out, and we are making new things together, but we're taking it slow and still doing most things wrong, so it does feel like right where we left off."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/chill-or-be-chilled/Content?oid=23668432|title=Chill or be Chilled|last=Gardner|first=Jeff|website=Tucson Weekly|language=en|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>

Generally seen as [[indie rock]], the group has been also associated with the [[space rock]] and [[slowcore]] movements by critics due to their unique sound.<ref name="p4k 1">{{cite web |last1=Moreland |first1=Quinn (2019-03-27) |title=Duster: Capsule Losing Contact Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/duster-capsule-losing-contact/ |website=pitchfork.com |publisher=Pitchfork Media |accessdate=2019-03-29}}</ref><ref name="Vice"/> To produce this, the band typically recorded on cheap and older recording equipment, such as cassette decks, in their Low Earth Orbit studio, giving their music a [[lo-fi music|lo-fi]] quality.<ref name="Vice"/>
