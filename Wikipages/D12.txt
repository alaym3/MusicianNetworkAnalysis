'''D12''' (an [[initialism]] for '''the Dirty Dozen''') was an American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] [[musical collective|collective]] from [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]]. Formed in 1996, the group achieved mainstream success with its lineup of ''de facto'' leader [[Eminem]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=5 Beefs Eminem Actually Squashed|url=https://hiphopdx.com/editorials/id.4148/title.5-beefs-eminem-actually-squashed|last=https://hiphopdx.com|first=HipHopDX-|date=2018-09-08|website=HipHopDX|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]], [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]], [[Mr. Porter]], Kuniva and Swifty McVay.

D12 had chart-topping albums in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia during the early 2000s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.d12world.com/chart_success.php |title=D12 Chart Success |publisher=D12 WORLD |access-date=March 30, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130106131927/http://www.d12world.com/chart_success.php |archive-date=January 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The group released the albums ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' in 2001 and ''[[D12 World]]'' in 2004, spawning numerous hits such as "[[Fight Music]]", "[[Purple Pills]]", "[[My Band]]", "[[How Come]]" and "[[Shit on You]]" throughout that period. Both albums were certified [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gold & Platinum|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|website=RIAA|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-28}}</ref> In 2004, the group won the [[MTV Europe Music Award]] for [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best Hip-Hop|Best Hip-Hop Act]].

Since 2006, Eminem's hiatus and the death of [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] resulted in the group being less active in subsequent years.  On August 31, 2018, Eminem released a song titled "[[Stepping Stone (Eminem song)|Stepping Stone]]" on his tenth studio album ''[[Kamikaze (Eminem album)|Kamikaze]]'' (2018) announcing that D12 had officially disbanded.<ref name="2Ls9v">{{cite web|url=https://www.complex.com/music/2018/08/rappers-eminem-name-drops-and-takes-shots-at-on-kamikaze|title=A Roundup of Rappers Eminem Name-Drops and Takes Shots at on 'Kamikaze'|website=Complex}}</ref>

==History==
===Early career and ''The Underground EP'' (1996–1998)===

In 1997, they released their debut extended play, ''The Underground EP'', which was recorded between 1996 and 1997. In 1997 and 1998, its members began establishing reputations locally. Bizarre was named ''Inner City Entertainment'''s "Flava of the Week" and went on to release an album, ''[[Attack of the Weirdos]]''. Along with Eminem, [[Rah Digga]] and [[Young Zee]], he became an honorary member of ''[[Outsidaz|The Outsidaz]]''. Proof won a [[freestyle music|freestyling]] competition run by ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]''. In 1999, Bugz released ''These Streets EP'', and made several appearances on other rappers' songs.

Around the time of Eminem's first record deal, Proof attempted to revive D12. He managed to recruit local Detroit hip hop duo Da Brigade, composed of Kuniva, a local MC, and Mr. Porter, a longtime friend of Eminem and Proof. At the time, Porter was the group's producer (he later produced Eminem's first album, ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]''), but Kuniva persuaded him to join the group as an artist. Later the group was joined by Bugz, and Bugz introduced his longtime friend Swift, who at the time was a member of rap duo Da Rabeez.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Death of Bugz (1999)===
On May 21, 1999 Bugz was shot and killed at a picnic.{{cn|date=October 2021}} One of his final acts had been a request that Swift join the group.<ref>{{cite web |title=D12World.com: Swift member page |url=http://www.d12world.com/index.php?s=swift |publisher=D12 World |year=2001 |access-date=July 31, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928013636/http://www.d12world.com/index.php?s=swift |archive-date=September 28, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Eminem volunteered to replace Bugz; this led to him rejoining the group.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eminem: Rolling The Dice On D12 |url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/d12/news_feature_042304/index2.jhtml |publisher=MTVNews.com |author=Joseph Patel, with reporting by Rahman Bugg |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519145500/http://www.mtv.com/bands/d/d12/news_feature_042304/index2.jhtml |archive-date=May 19, 2007 |df=mdy}}</ref>

''Mr. Obnoxious'', his first solo album, was released in February 2000 after his death. D12's first album, ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'', is dedicated to him.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

===''Devil's Night'', ''D12 World'' and appearances without Eminem (2000–2005)===
Their debut album, ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'', referring to the [[Devil's Night|tradition]] of setting unoccupied buildings on fire the night before [[Halloween]], was released in June 2001. It debuted at number one on the U.S. and number two on the UK chart,<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums" /> also reaching the top of the Canadian charts. ''Devil's Night'' went on to sell four million albums worldwide and two million in the U.S. In 2021, the album was rereleased digitally as an expanded edition to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of its release which featured three bonus tracks, an unreleased freestyle, the acapella version of Shit On You and the instrumentals to Shit On You, Purple Pills, Fight Music and Blow My Buzz.

In August 2001, D12 and [[Esham]] were kicked off the [[Warped Tour]] after members of the group physically attacked Esham over the lyrics of his song "Chemical Imbalance", which contained a reference to Eminem's daughter. Eminem was not present during the tour.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Moriates |title=Rappers Esham, D12 kicked off Warped Tour after alleged attack |url=http://dailybruin.com/archives/id/15893/ |work=The Daily Bruin |date=August 13, 2001 |access-date=July 19, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120819145420/http://www.dailybruin.com/archives/id/15893/ |archive-date=August 19, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Hasted |first=Nick |title=The Dark Story of Eminem |year=2005 |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=1-84449-726-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/darkstoryofemine0000hast/page/151 151] |chapter=The Waiting Room |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/darkstoryofemine0000hast/page/151 }}</ref>

D12 was eclipsed by Eminem's success, touring without him to promote their second album while he recorded ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]''. D12 members [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]] and [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] managed mildly successful solo careers with the releases of ''[[Hannicap Circus]]'' and ''[[Searching for Jerry Garcia]]'' in 2005. D12 performed live, without Eminem, at the [[House of Blues]] in [[Chicago]] to promote both albums. That concert was released on DVD in 2005 as ''D12: Live in Chicago''.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

D12, without Eminem, performed on the track "She-Devil" of [[Tech N9ne]]'s 2002 album ''[[Absolute Power (Tech N9ne album)|Absolute Power]]''.

After four years of inactivity D12 released a new mixtape ''Return of the Dozen Vol. 1'' (2008), without Eminem who was working on his solo album ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]''.
