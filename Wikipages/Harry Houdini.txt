'''Harry Houdini''' ({{IPAc-en|h|uː|ˈ|d|iː|n|i}}; born '''Erik Weisz'''; March 24, 1874 – October 31, 1926) was a Hungarian-born American [[escape artist]], [[illusionist]], [[stunt performer]] and [[wikt:mysteriarch|mysteriarch]], noted for his [[Escapology|escape acts]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Houdini! |url=http://americanarchive.org/catalog/cpb-aacip-526-9882j69777 |language=en |access-date=2021-03-11}}</ref>

He first attracted notice in [[vaudeville]] in the United States and then as "Harry 'Handcuff' Houdini" on a tour of Europe, where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up. Soon he extended his repertoire to include chains, ropes slung from [[skyscraper]]s, [[straitjacket]]s under water, and having to escape from and hold his breath inside a sealed milk can with water in it.

In 1904, thousands watched as he tried to escape from special [[handcuff]]s commissioned by London's ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', keeping them in suspense for an hour. Another stunt saw him [[Premature burial|buried alive]] and only just able to claw himself to the surface, emerging in a state of near-breakdown. While many suspected that these escapes were faked, Houdini presented himself as the scourge of fake [[spiritualist]]s. As President of the [[Society of American Magicians]], he was keen to uphold professional standards and expose fraudulent artists. He was also quick to sue anyone who imitated his escape stunts.

Houdini made several movies but quit acting when it failed to bring in money. He was also a keen aviator and aimed to become the first man to fly a powered aircraft in Australia.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maksel|first=Rebecca|title=The Hunt for Houdini’s Airplane|url=https://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/the-hunt-for-houdinis-airplane-8082655/|access-date=2021-08-04|website=Air & Space Magazine|language=en}}</ref>

==Early life==
Erik Weisz was born in [[Budapest]], [[Kingdom of Hungary]] to a [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Jewish]] family.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/03/137-years-ago-in-budapest.html |title=137 years ago in Budapest... |publisher=Wild About Harry |access-date=March 24, 2011}}</ref> His parents were [[rabbi]] Mayer Sámuel Weisz (1829–1892) and Cecília Steiner (1841–1913).

Weisz arrived in the [[United States]] on July 3, 1878, on the SS ''Fresia'' with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers.<ref>US National Archives Microfilm serial: M237; Microfilm roll: 413; Line: 38; List number: 684.</ref> The family changed their name to the German spelling Weiss, and Erik became Ehrich. The family lived in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], where his father served as rabbi of the Zion Reform Jewish Congregation.

According to the [[1880 US Census|1880 census]], the family lived on Appleton Street in an area that is now known as Houdini Plaza.<ref>[[1880 US Census]] with Samuel M. Weiss, Cecelia (wife), Armin M.<!-- Is this supposed to be Herman? -->, Nathan J., Ehrich, Theodore, and Leopold.</ref> On June 6, 1882, Rabbi Weiss became an American citizen. Losing his job at Zion in 1882, Rabbi Weiss and family moved to Milwaukee and fell into dire poverty.<ref>[http://www.houdinifile.com/2014/02/houdinis-forgotten-years.html Houdini's Forgotten Years] The Houdini File.</ref> In 1887, Rabbi Weiss moved with Ehrich to New York City, where they lived in a boarding house on [[79th Street (Manhattan)|East 79th Street]]. He was joined by the rest of the family once rabbi Weiss found permanent housing. As a child, Ehrich Weiss took several jobs, making his public début as a nine-year-old [[trapeze artist]], calling himself "Ehrich, the Prince of the Air". He was also a champion [[cross country running|cross country runner]] in his youth.

==Magic career==
When Weiss became a professional [[magic (illusion)|magician]] he began calling himself "Harry Houdini", after the French magician [[Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin]], after reading Robert-Houdin's [[autobiography]] in 1890. Weiss incorrectly believed that an ''i'' at the end of a name meant "like" in French. In later life, Houdini claimed that the first part of his new name, Harry, was an homage to [[Harry Kellar]], whom he also admired, though it was likely adapted from "Ehri", a nickname for "Ehrich", which is how he was known to his family.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taramarion.vpweb.com/upload/Harry%20Houdini.pdf|title=Harry Houdini|publisher=American Decades|date=December 16, 1998|access-date=February 4, 2016}} Also at [http://ic.galegroup.com/ic/bic1/ReferenceDetailsPage/ReferenceDetailsWindow?zid=2a3b8a0573f3c6eeab667966408317da&action=2&catId=&documentId=GALE%7CK1602000557&userGroupName=tlc199095657&jsid=8d70ce38fc654bb5c3842e043b6782b7 Biography In Context].</ref>

In 1894, while performing with his brother "[[Theodore Hardeen|Dash]]" (Theodore) at [[Coney Island]] as "The Brothers Houdini", Houdini met a fellow performer, [[Bess Houdini|Wilhelmina Beatrice "Bess" Rahner]]. Bess was initially courted by Dash, but she and Houdini married, with Bess replacing Dash in the act, which became known as "The Houdinis". For the rest of Houdini's performing career, Bess worked as his stage assistant.

Houdini's big break came in 1899 when he met manager [[Martin Beck (vaudeville)|Martin Beck]] in St. Paul, Minnesota. Impressed by Houdini's [[handcuffs]] act, Beck advised him to concentrate on escape acts and booked him on the [[Orpheum Circuit|Orpheum]] [[vaudeville]] circuit. Within months, he was performing at the top vaudeville houses in the country. In 1900, Beck arranged for Houdini to tour Europe. After some days of unsuccessful interviews in London, Houdini's British agent [[Harry Day (politician)|Harry Day]] helped him to get an interview with [[C. Dundas Slater]], then manager of the [[Alhambra Theatre]]. He was introduced to [[William Melville]] and gave a demonstration of escape from handcuffs at [[Scotland Yard]].<ref>[[William Lindsay Gresham|Gresham, William Lindsay]]. (1959). ''Houdini: The Man Who Walked Through Walls''. Holt. pp. 82–83</ref> He succeeded in baffling the police so effectively that he was booked at the Alhambra for six months.

Chapter One {{ISBN|978-1-47386-794-9}}</ref> He also toured the Netherlands, Germany, France, and Russia and became widely known as "The Handcuff King". In each city, Houdini challenged local police to restrain him with [[shackle]]s and lock him in their jails. In many of these challenge escapes, he was first [[strip search|stripped nude and searched]]. In [[Moscow]], he escaped from a [[Siberia]]n prison transport van, claiming that, had he been unable to free himself, he would have had to travel to Siberia, where the only key was kept.

In [[Cologne]], he sued a police officer, Werner Graff, who alleged that he made his escapes via [[bribery]].<ref>Silverman, p. 81.</ref> Houdini won the case when he opened the judge's safe (he later said the judge had forgotten to lock it). With his new-found wealth, Houdini purchased a dress said to have been made for [[Queen Victoria]]. He then arranged a grand reception where he presented his mother in the dress to all their relatives. Houdini said it was the happiest day of his life. In 1904, Houdini returned to the U.S. and purchased a house for $25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1904|fmt=eq}}), a [[brownstone]] at 278&nbsp;W. 113th Street in [[Harlem]], New York City.<ref>Silverman, p. 109.</ref>

While on tour in Europe in 1902, Houdini visited [[Blois]] with the aim of meeting the widow of Emile Houdin, the son of [[Jean-Eugène Robert-Houdin]], for an interview and permission to visit his grave. He did not receive permission but still visited the grave.<ref name="Steinmeyer 152-153">[[Jim Steinmeyer|Steinmeyer, Jim]]. (2004). ''Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible''.

Emile Robert-Houdin".<ref name="Steinmeyer 152-153"/> In 1906, he sent a letter to the French magazine ''L'Illusionniste'' stating: "You will certainly enjoy the article on Robert Houdin I am about to publish in my magazine.

In 1906, Houdini created his own publication, the ''Conjurers' Monthly Magazine''.<ref>[[William Lindsay Gresham|Gresham, William Lindsay]] (1959). ''Houdini: The Man Who Walked Through Walls''. Holt. p. 136</ref> It was a competitor to ''[[The Sphinx: An Independent Magazine for Magicians|The Sphinx]]'', but was short-lived and only two volumes were released until August 1908. Magic historian [[Jim Steinmeyer]] has noted that "Houdini couldn't resist using the journal for his own crusades, attacking his rivals, praising his own appearances, and subtly rewriting history to favor his view of magic."<ref>[[Jim Steinmeyer|Steinmeyer, Jim]].

[[File:After Harry Houdini jumps off Harvard Bridge in Boston 1908.jpg|thumb|250px|Harry Houdini before he jumped off the [[Harvard Bridge]] in [[Boston]] in 1908]]
From 1907 and throughout the 1910s, Houdini performed with great success in the United States. He freed himself from jails, handcuffs, chains, ropes, and [[straitjacket]]s, often while hanging from a rope in sight of street audiences. Because of imitators, Houdini put his "handcuff act" behind him on January 25, 1908, and began escaping from a locked, water-filled milk can. The possibility of failure and death thrilled his audiences. Houdini also expanded his repertoire with his escape challenge act, in which he invited the public to devise contraptions to hold him. These included nailed packing crates (sometimes lowered into water), riveted boilers, wet sheets, [[mail bag]]s,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m_-UQ8pUg_4C&q=Houdini+Mailbag+escape&pg=PA39 |first1=J.

Many of these challenges were arranged with local merchants in one of the first uses of mass [[tie-in]] [[marketing]] . Rather than promote the idea that he was assisted by spirits, as did the [[Davenport Brothers]] and others, Houdini's advertisements showed him making his escapes via [[Teleportation|dematerializing]], although Houdini himself never claimed to have supernatural powers.<ref name="secret">{{cite book |last1=Kalush |first1=William |first2=Larry |last2=Sloman |date=October 2006 |title=The Secret Life of Houdini: The Making of America's First Superhero |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |isbn=978-0-7432-7207-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/secretlifeofhoud00kalu |access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref>

After much research, Houdini wrote a collection of articles on the history of magic, which were expanded into ''The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin'' published in 1908. In this book he attacked his former idol Robert-Houdin as a liar and a fraud for having claimed the invention of automata and effects such as [[Aerial suspension (illusion)|aerial suspension]], which had been in existence for many years.<ref>[[Jim Steinmeyer|Steinmeyer, Jim]]. (2004). ''Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible''. Da Capo Press. pp. 154–155. {{ISBN|0-7867-1401-8}} "He decided to portray Robert-Houdin as a liar and thief who was completely incompetent as a magician. Houdini had developed a hatred for his spiritual father. In 1908 his collection of articles was gathered together, expanded and sold to a London publisher. By comparing the original articles with the finished book, it's clear that Houdini employed a ghost writer to polish the language and clarify his points. Other surviving manuscripts from Houdini demonstrate that most of Houdini's writing depended on ghostwriters. The theme of his book on Robert-Houdin was sharpened to a razor's edge, and was now titled ''The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin''."</ref><ref>Goto-Jones, Chris. (2016). ''Conjuring Asia''. Cambridge University Press. p. 193. {{ISBN|978-1-107-07659-4}}</ref> Many of the allegations in the book were dismissed by magicians and researchers who defended Robert-Houdin. Magician [[Jean Hugard]] would later write a full rebuttal to Houdini's book.<ref>Inge, M. Thomas; Hall, Dennis. (2002). ''The Greenwood Guide to American Popular Culture, Volume 3''. Greenwood Press. p. 1037. {{ISBN|978-0313323690}} "Stung by the refusal of the widow of Robert-Houdin's son Emile to receive him in 1901, Houdini launched a literary vendetta against his former hero in the form of a book, ''The Unmasking of Robert-Houdin'', published seven years later. While the book did not achieve its aim, it remains of considerable historical interest as the first sustained attempt to mine Houdini's large and growing collection for historical information. Its errors and oversights became the subject of two extensive rebuttals. The first was Maurice Sardina's ''Les Erreurs de Harry Houdini'', translated and edited by Victor Farelli as ''Where Houdini Was Wrong''. The second was Jean Hugard's ''Houdini's "Unmasking": Fact vs Fiction''.</ref><ref>[[Jim Steinmeyer|Steinmeyer, Jim]]. (2004). ''Hiding The Elephant: How Magicians Invented the Impossible''.

[[File:Houdini challenge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Poster promoting Houdini taking up the challenge of escaping an "extra strong and large traveling basket"]]
Houdini introduced the [[Chinese Water Torture Cell]] at the Circus Busch in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], on September 21, 1912.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mastronet.com/index.cfm?action=DisplayContent&ContentName=Lot%20Information&LotIndex=78310 |title=1912 Harry Houdini 'Water Torture Cell' Presentation Piece from Circus Busch Containing the Original Concept Art for the Performance's Famous Poster |access-date=May 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220050429/http://www.mastronet.com/index.cfm?action=DisplayContent&ContentName=Lot%20Information&LotIndex=78310 |archive-date=December 20, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was suspended upside-down in a locked glass-and-steel cabinet full to overflowing with water, holding his breath for more than three minutes. He would go on performing this escape for the rest of his life.

During his career, Houdini explained some of his tricks in books written for the magic brotherhood. In ''Handcuff Secrets'' (1909), he revealed how many locks and handcuffs could be opened with properly applied force, others with shoestrings. Other times, he carried concealed [[lock picking|lockpicks]] or keys. When tied down in ropes or [[straitjacket]]s, he gained wiggle room by enlarging his shoulders and chest, moving his arms slightly away from his [[Human body|body]].<ref name="secret"/>

[[File:Houdini in Handcuffs, 1918.JPG|thumb|upright|Houdini in handcuffs, 1918]]
His straitjacket escape was originally performed behind curtains, with him popping out free at the end. Houdini's brother (who was also an escape artist, billing himself as [[Theodore Hardeen]]) discovered that audiences were more impressed when the curtains were eliminated so they could watch him struggle to get out. On more than one occasion, they both performed straitjacket escapes while dangling upside-down from the roof of a building in the same city.<ref name="secret"/>

For most of his career, Houdini was a headline act in [[vaudeville]]. For many years, he was the highest-paid performer in American vaudeville. One of Houdini's most notable non-escape stage illusions was performed at the [[New York Hippodrome]], when he vanished a full-grown elephant from the stage.<ref>[http://www.thegreatharryhoudini.com/vanishingelephant.html "The Vanishing Elephant"]. Retrieved June 30, 2016.</ref> He had purchased this trick from the magician [[Charles Morritt]].<ref>[[Milbourne Christopher|Christopher, Milbourne]]. (1990 edition, originally published in 1962). ''Magic: A Picture History''. Dover Publications. p. 160. {{ISBN|0-486-26373-8}} "Morritt invented a 'Disappearing Donkey'. When he expanded the idea so that an elephant could be whisked away in a box, Houdini bought the full rights to the spectacular illusion."</ref><ref>Silverman, p. 224.</ref> In 1923, Houdini became president of [[Martinka]] & Co., America's oldest magic company. The business is still in operation today.

He also served as president of the [[Society of American Magicians]] ({{aka}} S.A.M.) from 1917 until his death in 1926. Founded on May 10, 1902, in the back room of Martinka's magic shop in New York, the Society expanded under the leadership of Harry Houdini during his term as national president from 1917 to 1926. Houdini was magic's greatest visionary. He sought to create a large, unified national network of professional and amateur magicians. Wherever he traveled, he gave a lengthy formal address to the local magic club, made speeches, and usually threw a banquet for the members at his own expense. He said "The Magicians Clubs as a rule are small: they are weak ... but if we were amalgamated into one big body the society would be stronger, and it would mean making the small clubs powerful and worthwhile. Members would find a welcome wherever they happened to be and, conversely, the safeguard of a city-to-city hotline to track exposers and other undesirables". 

For most of 1916, while on his vaudeville tour, Houdini had been recruiting—at his own expense—local magic clubs to join the S.A.M. in an effort to revitalize what he felt was a weak organization. Houdini persuaded groups in Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Kansas City to join. As had happened in London, he persuaded magicians to join. The Buffalo club joined as the first branch, (later assembly) of the Society. Chicago Assembly No. 3 was, as the name implies, the third regional club to be established by the S.A.M., whose assemblies now number in the hundreds. In 1917, he signed Assembly Number Three's charter into existence, and that charter and this club continue to provide Chicago magicians with a connection to each other and to their past. Houdini dined with, addressed, and got pledges from similar clubs in Detroit, Rochester, Pittsburgh, Kansas City, Cincinnati and elsewhere. This was the biggest movement ever in the history of magic. In places where no clubs existed, he rounded up individual magicians, introduced them to each other, and urged them into the fold.

By the end of 1916, magicians' clubs in San Francisco and other cities that Houdini had not visited were offering to become assemblies. He had created the richest and longest-surviving organization of magicians in the world. It now embraces almost 6,000 dues-paying members and almost 300 assemblies worldwide. In July 1926, Houdini was elected for the ninth successive time President of the Society of American Magicians. Every other president has only served for one year. He also was President of the Magicians' Club of London.<ref name="Houdini!">{{cite book |first=Kenneth |last=Silverman |title=Houdini!

===''Daily Mirror'' challenge===
[[File:HandCuffHarryHoudini.jpg|thumb|left|upright|"Handcuff" Harry Houdini, c. 1905]]
In 1904, the London ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from [[Birmingham]], five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinée performance at London's Hippodrome theatre. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his "ghost house" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat.

The ''Mirror'' representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a [[penknife]] and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56&nbsp;minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the six-inch key.<ref>''The Secret Life of Houdini'', Kaulush & Sloman, 2006.</ref> Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career.<ref>{{cite web |title=Houdini's Mirror Handcuff Challenge, Getting Closer to the Truth |first=Mick |last=Hanzlik |year=2007 |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/09/mick-hanzlik-completes-mirror-handcuff.html}} Reproduction in full of ''Daily Mirror'' article "Houdini's Great Victory", March 18, 1904.</ref>

After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in [[Will Goldston]]'s book, ''Sensational Tales of Mystery Men'', as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the ''Mirror'' representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book ''The Secret Life of Houdini'' that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was six inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the ''Mirror'' challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;59–62.</ref>

This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's ''[[Mysteries at the Museum]]'' in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum.<ref name=mysteries>{{cite web |title=Keys To Houdini's Secrets |publisher=[[Travel Channel]]| series=[[Mysteries at the Museum]] |date=November 23, 2010 |access-date=November 9, 2015 |url=http://www.travelchannel.com/shows/mysteries-at-the-museum/video/the-secret-to-houdini-s-tricks}}</ref>

===''Milk Can Escape''===
In 1908, Houdini introduced his own original act, the Milk Can Escape.<ref>Randi, pp. 175–178.</ref> In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can filled with water and made his escape behind a curtain. As part of the effect, Houdini invited members of the audience to hold their breath along with him while he was inside the can. Advertised with dramatic posters that proclaimed "Failure Means A Drowning Death", the escape proved to be a sensation.<ref>Randi, Milk Can poster on page&nbsp;177.</ref> Houdini soon modified the escape to include the milk can being locked inside a wooden chest, being chained or padlocked. Houdini performed the milk can escape as a regular part of his act for only four years, but it has remained one of the acts most associated with him. Houdini's brother, [[Theodore Hardeen]], continued to perform the milk can escape and its wooden chest variant<ref>{{cite book| last=Christopher| first=Milbourne| title=Houdini: A Pictorial Life| date=October 1976| isbn=978-0690011524| page=[https://archive.org/details/houdini00milb/page/54 54]| publisher=Ty Crowell Co.| url=https://archive.org/details/houdini00milb/page/54}}</ref> into the 1940s.

After other magicians proposed variations on the Milk Can Escape, Houdini claimed that the act was copyrighted and settled out of court in 1906 a case with [[John Clempert]], one of the most persistent imitators, who agreed to publish an apology.<ref>{{cite book |last=Tait |first=Derek| date=2018 |title=The Great Illusionists|location=Barnsley South, Yorkshire |publisher=Pen and Sword History |pages=260–274|isbn=978-1473890763}}</ref>

===Chinese water torture cell===
{{main|Chinese Water Torture Cell}}
[[File:Houdini performing Water Torture Cell.jpg|thumb|upright|Houdini performing the Chinese Water Torture Cell]]

Around 1912, the vast number of imitators prompted Houdini to replace his milk can act with the Chinese water torture cell. In this escape, Houdini's feet were locked in [[stocks]], and he was lowered upside down into a tank filled with water. The [[mahogany]] and metal cell featured a glass front, through which audiences could clearly see Houdini. The stocks were locked to the top of the cell, and a curtain concealed his escape. In the earliest version of the torture cell, a metal cage was lowered into the cell, and Houdini was enclosed inside that. While making the escape more difficult – the cage prevented Houdini from turning – the cage bars also offered protection should the front glass break.

The original cell was built in England, where Houdini first performed the escape for an audience of one person as part of a one-act play he called "Houdini Upside Down". This was so he could [[copyright]] the effect and have grounds to sue imitators, which he did. While the escape was advertised as "The Chinese Water Torture Cell" or "The Water Torture Cell", Houdini always referred to it as "the Upside Down" or "USD". The first public performance of the USD was at the Circus Busch in [[Berlin]], on September 21, 1912. Houdini continued to perform the escape until his death in 1926.<ref name="secret"/>

===Suspended straitjacket escape===
One of Houdini's most popular publicity stunts was to have himself strapped into a regulation straitjacket and suspended by his ankles from a tall building or crane. Houdini would then make his [[Straitjacket#Escape techniques|escape]] in full view of the assembled crowd. In many cases, Houdini drew tens of thousands of onlookers who brought city traffic to a halt. Houdini would sometimes ensure press coverage by performing the escape from the office building of a local newspaper. In New York City, Houdini performed the suspended straitjacket escape from a crane being used to build the [[New York City Subway|subway]]. After flinging his body in the air, he escaped from the straitjacket. Starting from when he was hoisted up in the air by the crane, to when the straitjacket was completely off, it took him two minutes and thirty-seven seconds. There is film footage in the Library of Congress of Houdini performing the escape.<ref>"[http://lccn.loc.gov/94505242 Thousands see Harry Houdini escape from a straitjacket while hanging in mid-air, Chicago, Ill.]", International news [1923 or 1924?]</ref> Films of his escapes are also shown at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania.

After being battered against a building in high winds during one escape, Houdini performed the escape with a visible safety wire on his ankle so that he could be pulled away from the building if necessary. The idea for the upside-down escape was given to Houdini by a young boy named [[Randolph Osborne Douglas]] (March 31, 1895&nbsp;– December 5, 1956), when the two met at a performance at [[Sheffield]]'s Empire Theatre.<ref name="secret"/>

===Overboard box escape===
[[File:HoudiniSubmergedCrate.jpg|thumb|left|Houdini prepares to do the overboard box escape c. 1912]]
Another of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's [[East River]] on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.

Houdini performed this escape many times, and even performed a version on stage, first at Hamerstein's Roof Garden where a {{convert|5500|USgal|l|adj=on}} tank was specially built, and later at the [[New York Hippodrome]].<ref>{{cite book| title=Houdini His Legend and His Magic| last=Henning| first=Doug| author-link=Doug Henning| date=December 1, 1977| publisher=[[Times Books]]| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtMTAQAAIAAJ&q=hamerstein%27s+roof | isbn=9780812906868}}</ref>

===Buried alive stunt===
Houdini performed at least three variations on a [[Premature burial|buried alive]] stunt during his career. The first was near Santa Ana, California in 1915, and it almost cost him his life. Houdini was buried, without a casket, in a pit of earth six feet deep. He became exhausted and panicked while trying to dig his way to the surface and called for help. When his hand finally broke the surface, he fell unconscious and had to be pulled from the grave by his assistants. Houdini wrote in his diary that the escape was "very dangerous" and that "the weight of the earth is killing".<ref>{{cite book| last=Christopher| first=Milbourne| title=Houdini: The Untold Story| url=https://archive.org/details/houdiniuntoldsto00chri| url-access=registration| date=1969| isbn=978-0891909811| page=[https://archive.org/details/houdiniuntoldsto00chri/page/140 140]| publisher=Ty Crowell Co.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2011/01/digging-into-buried-alive.html |title=Digging into Houdini's Buried Alive |access-date=January 6, 2011}}</ref>

Houdini's second variation on buried alive was an endurance test designed to expose mystical Egyptian performer Rahman Bey, who had claimed to use supernatural powers to remain in a sealed casket for an hour. Houdini bettered Bey on August 5, 1926, by remaining in a sealed casket, or coffin, submerged in the swimming pool of New York's Hotel Shelton for one and a half hours. Houdini claimed he did not use any trickery or supernatural powers to accomplish this feat, just controlled breathing.<ref>Silverman, pp.&nbsp;397–403.</ref> He repeated the feat at the YMCA in Worcester, Massachusetts on September 28, 1926, this time remaining sealed for one hour and eleven minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/01/uncovering-houdinis-forgotten-second.html |title=Uncovering Houdini's second underwater test |access-date=January 26, 2010}}</ref>

Houdini's final buried alive was an elaborate stage escape that featured in his full evening show. Houdini would escape after being strapped in a straitjacket, sealed in a casket, and then buried in a large tank filled with sand. While posters advertising the escape exist (playing off the Bey challenge by boasting "Egyptian Fakirs Outdone!"), it is unclear whether Houdini ever performed buried alive on stage. The stunt was to be the feature escape of his 1927 season, but Houdini died on October 31, 1926. The bronze casket Houdini created for buried alive was used to transport Houdini's body from Detroit to New York following his death on [[Halloween]].<ref>Silverman, p. 406.</ref>

In 1906, Houdini started showing films of his outside escapes as part of his vaudeville act. In Boston, he presented a short film called ''Houdini Defeats Hackenschmidt''. [[Georg Hackenschmidt]] was a famous wrestler of the day, but the nature of their contest is unknown as the film is lost.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/01/houdini-defeats-hackenschmidt-and-other.html| title=Houdini Defeats Hackenschmidt and other revelations from Disappearing Tricks| access-date=January 31, 2010}}</ref> In 1909, Houdini made a film in Paris for Cinema Lux titled ''Merveilleux Exploits du Célébre Houdini à Paris'' (Marvellous Exploits of the Famous Houdini in Paris).<ref>''Disappearing Tricks'' by Matthew Solomon, 2010, p. 95.</ref> It featured a loose narrative designed to showcase several of Houdini's famous escapes, including his straitjacket and underwater handcuff escapes. That same year Houdini got an offer to star as [[Captain Nemo]] in a silent version of ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'', but the project never made it into production.<ref>Silverman, p. 205.</ref>

It is often erroneously reported that Houdini served as special-effects consultant on the Wharton/International cliffhanger serial, ''The Mysteries of Myra'', shot in Ithaca, New York, because Harry Grossman, director of ''The Master Mystery'' also filmed a serial in Ithaca at about the same time. The consultants on the serial were pioneering [[Hereward Carrington]] and [[Aleister Crowley]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stedman |first1=Eric |title=The Mysteries of Myra |year=2010 |page=8}}</ref>

In 1918, Houdini signed a contract with film producer [[B. A. Rolfe]] to star in a 15-part [[serial (film)|serial]], ''[[The Master Mystery]]'' (released in November 1918). As was common at the time, the film serial was released simultaneously with a novel. Financial difficulties resulted in [[Rolfe Photoplays Inc.|B. A. Rolfe Productions]] going out of business, but ''The Master Mystery'' led to Houdini being signed by [[Famous Players-Lasky Corporation]]/[[Paramount Pictures]], for whom he made two pictures, ''The Grim Game'' (1919) and ''[[Terror Island]]'' (1920).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/12/adroit-harry-and-ancient-hokum.html |title=Adroit Harry and ancient hokum |access-date=December 30, 2012}}</ref>

''[[The Grim Game]]'' was Houdini's first full-length movie and is reputed to be his best. Because of the flammable nature of [[Nitrocellulose#Film|nitrate film]] and their low rate of survival, film historians considered the film lost. One copy did exist hidden in the collection of a private collector only known to a tiny group of magicians that saw it. Dick Brookz and Dorothy Dietrich of The Houdini Museum in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], had seen it twice on the invitation of the collector. After many years of trying, they finally got him to agree to sell the film to [[Turner Classic Movies]]<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.turner.com/pressroom/tcm-fest-present-lost-houdini-film |title=Turner Classic Movies to Host World Premiere Screening of Long Lost Harry Houdini Classic The Grim Game at 2015 TCM Classic Film Festival |date=January 23, 2015 |publisher=TCM |access-date=November 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102051055/https://www.turner.com/pressroom/tcm-fest-present-lost-houdini-film|archive-date=2 January 2016}}</ref> who restored the complete 71-minute film.

[[File:Houdini swims river in scene from The man from beyond (cropped).JPG|thumb|upright|Houdini swims above [[Niagara Falls]] in a scene from ''[[The Man from Beyond]]'' (1922)]]
While filming an aerial stunt for ''The Grim Game'', two biplanes collided in mid-air with a stuntman doubling Houdini dangling by a rope from one of the planes. Publicity was geared heavily toward promoting this dramatic "caught on film" moment, claiming it was Houdini himself dangling from the plane. While filming these movies in Los Angeles, Houdini rented a home in [[Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California|Laurel Canyon]]. Following his two-picture stint in Hollywood, Houdini returned to New York and started his own film production company called the "Houdini Picture Corporation". He produced and starred in two films, ''[[The Man from Beyond]]'' (1921) and ''[[Haldane of the Secret Service]]'' (1923). He also founded his own film laboratory business called The Film Development Corporation (FDC), gambling on a new process for developing motion picture film. Houdini's brother, [[Theodore Hardeen]], left his own career as a magician and escape artist to run the company. Magician [[Harry Kellar]] was a major investor.<ref>Silverman, pp. 226–249.</ref>  In 1919 Houdini moved to Los Angeles to film. He resided in 2435 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, a residence owned by Ralph M. Walker. The Houdini Estate, a tribute to Houdini, is located on on 2400 Laurel Canyon Boulevard. Previously home to Walker himself. <ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2012/03/inside-houdini-estate.html?m=1 | title= The true story of the Laurel Canyon Houdini Estate | publisher=[[John Cox and Patrick Culliton]] | access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>  The Houdini Estate is subject to controversy, in that it is disputed whether Houdini ever actually made it his home. While there are claims it was Houdini's house. others counter that "he never set foot" on the property. Its is rooted in Bess's parties or hold seances, etc.  Across the street, she would do so at the Walker mansion. In fact, the guesthouse featured an [[elevato]] connecting to a tunnel that crossed underw Laurel Canyon to the big house grounds (though capped, the tunnel still exists)./<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2012/03/inside-houdini-estate.html| title=The true story of the Laurel Canyon Houdini Estate | publisher=Patrick Culliton and John Cox | access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>

Neither Houdini's acting career nor FDC found success, and he gave up on the movie business in 1923, complaining that "the profits are too meager".

In April 2008, Kino International released a DVD box set of Houdini's surviving silent films, including ''The Master Mystery'', ''Terror Island'', ''The Man From Beyond'', ''Haldane of the Secret Service'', and five minutes from ''The Grim Game''. The set also includes newsreel footage of Houdini's escapes from 1907 to 1923, and a section from ''Merveilleux Exploits du Célébre Houdini à Paris, ''although it is not identified as such.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2008/04/houdini-movie-star-dvd-collection.html| title=Houdini The Movie Star DVD collection released| access-date=April 8, 2008}}</ref>

==Aviator==
In 1909, Houdini became fascinated with aviation. He purchased a French [[Voisin 1907 biplane|Voisin biplane]] for $5,000 ({{Inflation|US|5000|1907|fmt=eq}}) and hired a full-time mechanic, Antonio Brassac. After crashing once, he made his first successful flight on November 26 in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The following year, Houdini toured Australia. He brought along his Voisin biplane with the intention to be the first person in Australia to fly.

=== Falsely reported as pioneer ===
On March 18, 1910, he made three flights at [[Diggers Rest, Victoria]], near Melbourne. It was reported at the time that this was the first aerial flight in Australia,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=EP19100319.2.62| work=[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|The Evening Post]]| location=Wellington| date=March 19, 1910| title=AERIAL FLIGHT IN AUSTRALIA| volume=LXXIX| issue=66| agency=[[Press Association]]| access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref name=smh>{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/houdinis-australian-dream-one-for-the-record-books/2008/05/09/1210131263951.html| title=Houdini's Australian dream: one for the record books| work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]| date=May 10, 2008| first=Max| last=Prisk| access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aarg.com.au/Aviation-EarlyAustralian.htm |title=Australian National Aviation Museum&nbsp;– Early Australian Aviation |publisher=Aarg.com.au |access-date=April 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719022731/http://www.aarg.com.au/Aviation-EarlyAustralian.htm |archive-date=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> and a century later, some major news outlets still credit him with this feat.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/31/sunday/main7008518.shtml| title=The Art and Magic of Harry Houdini| work=[[CBS News]]| date=November 2, 2010| access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref><ref>[http://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/article/2010/03/18/166815_entertainment-news.html Entertainment Houdini's flight into history].

Wing Commander [[Harry Cobby]] wrote in ''Aircraft'' in March 1938 that "the first aeroplane flight in the Southern Hemisphere was made on December 9, 1909, by Mr [[Colin Defries]], a Londoner, at [[Victoria Park Racecourse, Sydney]], in a Wilbur Wright aeroplane".<ref>While this was possibly the first flight in Australia, the first flight in the Southern Hemisphere was probably made by [[Richard Pearse]] in New Zealand several years earlier, either in 1903 or 1904.</ref> Colin Defries was a trained pilot, having learnt to fly in Cannes, France. By modern standards his flight time was minimal, but in 1909 he had accumulated enough to become an instructor. On his first flight he took off, maintained straight and level flight, albeit briefly, and landed safely. His crash landing on his second flight, when he tried to retrieve his hat which was blown off, demonstrated what a momentary lack of attention could cause while flying a [[Wright Model A]].

It is accepted by Australian historians<ref>The [[Powerhouse Museum]] is the major branch of the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney. [http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/collection/blog/index.php/2009/12/first-powered-flight-in-australia-episode-4/ First Powered Flight in Australia- Episode 4 « Inside the collection – Powerhouse Museum]. Powerhousemuseum.com. Retrieved February 28, 2012.</ref> and the Aviation Historical Society of Australia that the definition of flight established by the Gorell Committee on behalf of the [[Aero Club of Great Britain]] dictates the acceptance of a flight or its rejection, giving Colin Defries credit as the first to make an aeroplane flight in Australia, and the Southern Hemisphere.

Additionally, aviation pioneer [[Richard Pearse]] is believed by many New Zealand historians to have undertaken his first flight as early as 1902, which would give him not only the Southern Hemisphere but the World record, although this is disputed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/richard-pearse|title=Richard Pearse|access-date=June 10, 2015|work=New Zealand History}}</ref>

In 1965, aviation journalist [[Stanley Brogden]] formed the view that the first powered flight in Australia took place at Bolivar in South Australia; the aircraft was a Bleriot monoplane with Fred Custance as the pilot. The flight took place on March 17, 1910. The next day when Houdini took to the air, the Herald newspaper reported Custance's flight, stating it had lasted 5&nbsp;minutes 25&nbsp;seconds at a height of between 12 and 15&nbsp;feet.<ref name=smh/>

In 2010, [[Australia Post]] issued stamps commemorating Colin Defries, Houdini and [[John Robertson Duigan]], crediting only Defries and Duigan with historical firsts.<ref>[http://auspost.com.au/about-us/harry-houdini-cant-escape-being-part-of-australias-history.html Australia Post – Harry Houdini can't escape being part of Australia's history].

Australia Post did acknowledge the part Houdini played  in their article "''Harry Houdini can't escape being part of Australia's history"'' but did not attribute any record to him.

===After Australia===
After completing his Australia tour, Houdini put the Voisin into storage in England. He announced he would use it to fly from city to city during his next music hall tour, and even promised to leap from it handcuffed, but he never flew again.<ref>Silverman, pp. 137–154.</ref>

Houdini's training in magic allowed him to expose frauds who had successfully fooled many scientists and academics. He was a member of a ''[[Scientific American]]'' committee that offered a cash prize to any medium who could successfully demonstrate [[supernatural]] abilities. None was able to do so, and the prize was never collected. The first to be tested was medium [[George Valiantine]] of [[Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania]]. As his fame as a "ghostbuster" grew, Houdini took to attending [[séance]]s in disguise, accompanied by a reporter and police officer. Possibly the most famous medium whom he debunked was [[Mina Crandon]], also known as "Margery".<ref>{{cite web| series=[[American Experience]]| title="Margery" the Medium Exposed |publisher=[[PBS]]| year=2011| access-date=November 9, 2015| url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/houdini/sfeature/margery1.html}}</ref>

[[Joaquín Argamasilla]], known as the "Spaniard with X-ray Eyes", claimed to be able to [[Dermo-optical perception|read]] handwriting or numbers on [[dice]] through closed metal boxes. In 1924, he was exposed by Houdini as a fraud. Argamasilla peeked through his simple blindfold and lifted up the edge of the box so he could look inside it without others noticing.<ref>Nickell, Joe (2007).

Houdini's exposing of phony mediums has inspired other magicians to follow suit, including [[The Amazing Randi]], [[Dorothy Dietrich]], [[Penn & Teller]], and [[Dick Brookz]].<ref name="Williams">{{cite news |title=Annual Houdini Séance to be held on Halloween |first=Michael |last=Williams |access-date=November 9, 2015 |url=http://tnsjournal.com/culture/annual-houdini-seance-held-halloween/ |work=Tennessee Star Journal |date=October 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022100650/http://tnsjournal.com/culture/annual-houdini-seance-held-halloween/ |archive-date=October 22, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Houdini chronicled his debunking exploits in his book, ''A Magician Among the Spirits'', co-authored with [[C. M. Eddy, Jr.]], who was not credited. These activities compromised Houdini's friendship with Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Doyle, a firm believer in [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|spiritualism]] during his later years, refused to believe any of Houdini's exposés. Doyle came to believe that Houdini was a powerful spiritualist medium, and had performed many of his stunts by means of paranormal abilities and was using these abilities to block those of other mediums that he was "debunking".<ref>see Conan Doyle's ''The Edge of The Unknown'', published in 1931.</ref> This disagreement led to the two men becoming public antagonists and Sir Arthur came to view Houdini as a dangerous enemy.<ref name="secret"/>

Before Houdini died, he and his wife agreed that if Houdini found it possible to communicate after death, he would communicate the message "Rosabelle believe", a secret code which they agreed to use. Rosabelle was their favorite song. Bess held yearly [[Seances|séances]] on [[Halloween]] for ten years after Houdini's death. She did claim to have contact through [[Arthur Ford (psychic)|Arthur Ford]] in 1929 when Ford conveyed the secret code, but Bess later said the incident had been faked. The code seems to have been such that it could be broken by Ford or his associates using existing clues.<ref name="secret"/> Evidence to this effect was discovered by Ford's biographer after he died in 1971.<ref>{{cite book| first1=Allen| last1=Spragget| first2= William V.| last2=Rauscher| title=Arthur Ford: The Man Who Talked with the Dead| year=1974| publisher=[[New American Library]]| page=246}}</ref> In 1936, after a last unsuccessful séance on the roof of the [[Knickerbocker Hotel (Los Angeles)|Knickerbocker Hotel]], she put out the candle that she had kept burning beside a photograph of Houdini since his death. In 1943, Bess said that "ten years is long enough to wait for any man."

The tradition of holding a séance for Houdini continues, held by magicians throughout the world. The Official Houdini Séance was organized in the 1940s<ref>{{cite news| title=Boldt CEO spends Halloween in search of Houdini| url=http://www.postcrescent.com/story/news/local/2014/10/30/boldt-ceo-spends-halloween-search-houdini/18203727/| first=Ed| last=Berthiaume| date=October 31, 2014| work=[[The Post-Crescent]]| location=Appleton, Wisconsin| access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref> by [[Sidney Hollis Radner]], a Houdini aficionado from Holyoke, Massachusetts.<ref>Houdini Facts [https://web.archive.org/web/20100421073238/http://www.foxvalleyhistory.org/houdini/facts.asp].</ref> Yearly Houdini séances are also conducted in Chicago at the [[Excalibur (nightclub)|Excalibur]] nightclub by "[[necromancer]]" [[Neil Tobin]] on behalf of the Chicago Assembly of the [[Society of American Magicians]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wgntv.trb.com/news/local/morningnews/wgntv-news-102805larrysworld,0,2750659.story?coll=wgntv-morning-news-1|title=Houdini's Halloween|publisher=[[WGN-TV]] and Red Eye|date=October 28, 2005|access-date=February 4, 2016|archive-date=March 10, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310222125/http://wgntv.trb.com/news/local/morningnews/wgntv-news-102805larrysworld,0,2750659.story?coll=wgntv-morning-news-1 }}</ref> and at the Houdini Museum in Scranton by magician [[Dorothy Dietrich]], who previously held them at New York's [[Magic Towne House]] with such magical notables as Houdini biographers [[Walter B.

After doing them for many years at New York's Magic Towne House, before he died, Walter passed on the tradition of conducting of the Original Seances to Dorothy Dietrich.<ref name="Williams"/>

In 1926, Harry Houdini hired [[H. P. Lovecraft]] and his friend [[C. M. Eddy, Jr.]], to write an entire book about debunking religious miracles, which was to be called ''[[The Cancer of Superstition]].'' Houdini had earlier asked Lovecraft to write an article about astrology, for which he paid $75 ({{Inflation|US|75|1926|fmt=eq}}). The article does not survive. Lovecraft's detailed synopsis for ''Cancer'' does survive, as do three chapters of the treatise written by Eddy. Houdini's death derailed the plans, as his widow did not wish to pursue the project.<ref>{{cite book| title=Collected Essays of H. P.

==Appearance and voice recordings==
[[File:Jack Dempsey, Harry Houdini and Benny Leonard2.jpg|thumb|Heavyweight boxer [[Jack Dempsey]] mock-punching Houdini (held back by lightweight boxer [[Benny Leonard]])]]Unlike the image of the classic magician, Houdini was short and stocky and typically appeared on stage in a long frock coat and tie. Most biographers give his height as {{convert|5|ft|5|in|m}}, but descriptions vary. Houdini was also said to be slightly [[bow-legged]], which aided in his ability to gain slack during his rope escapes. In the 1997 biography ''Houdini!!!: The Career of Ehrich Weiss'', author [[Kenneth Silverman]] summarizes how reporters described Houdini's appearance during his early career:

{{quote|They stressed his smallness—"somewhat undersized"—and angular, vivid features: "He is smooth-shaven with a keen, sharp-chinned, sharp-cheekboned face, bright blue eyes and thick, curly, black hair." Some sensed how much his complexly expressive smile was the outlet of his charismatic stage presence. It communicated to audiences at once warm amiability, pleasure in performing, and, more subtly, imperious self-assurance. Several reporters tried to capture the charming effect, describing him as "happy-looking", "pleasant-faced", "good natured at all times", "the young Hungarian magician with the pleasant smile and easy confidence".<ref>Silverman, p. 31.</ref>}}

Houdini made the only known recordings of his voice on Edison [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinder]]s on October 29, 1914, in [[Flatbush, New York]]. On them, Houdini practices several different introductory speeches for his famous [[Chinese Water Torture Cell]]. He also invites his sister, Gladys, to recite a poem. Houdini then recites the same poem in German. The six wax cylinders were discovered in the collection of magician [[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]] after his death in 1970. They are part of the [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] collection.<ref name="Wild About Harry">{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2010/11/houdini-speaks-in-1970.html |title=Houdini speaks in 1970 |access-date=November 13, 2010}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Houdini became an active [[Freemason]] and was a member of St. Cecile Lodge No. 568 in New York City.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html| publisher=MWGLNY| title=Famous Masons| date=January 2014| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110010123/http://www.nymasons.org/about-freemasonry/famous-masons-i.html| archive-date=November 10, 2013| df=mdy-all}}</ref>

In 1904, Houdini bought a New York City townhouse at 278 West 113th Street in Harlem. He paid US$25,000 ({{Inflation|US|25000|1904|fmt=eq}}) for the five-level, 6,008-square-foot house, which was built in 1895, and lived in it with his wife Bess, and various other relatives until his death in 1926. In March 2018, it was purchased for $3.6 million. A plaque affixed to the building by the Historical Landmark Preservation Center reads, "The magician lived here from 1904 to 1926 collecting illusions, theatrical memorabilia, and books on psychic phenomena and magic."<ref>{{cite web|author=Gordon, Lisa Kaplan|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/g10202603/harry-houdini-house/|title=Harry Houdini's House Is About to Disappear from the Market|magazine=[[Town & Country (magazine)|Town & Country]]|date=March 27, 2018|access-date=January 2, 2020|archive-date=October 30, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030203340/https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/real-estate/g10202603/harry-houdini-house/}}</ref>

In 1919, Houdini moved to Los Angeles to film. He resided in 2435 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, a house of his friend and business associate Ralph M. Walker, who owned both sides of the street, 2335 and 2400, the latter address having a pool where Houdini practiced his water escapes. 2400 Laurel Canyon Boulevard, previously numbered 2398, is presently known as The Houdini Estate, thus named in the honor of Houdini's time there, the same estate where Bess Houdini threw a party for 500 magicians years after his death. After decades of abandonment, the estate was acquired in 2006 by José Luis Nazar, a Chilean/American citizen who has restored it to its former splendor.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2012/03/inside-houdini-estate.html?m=1 | title= The true story of the Laurel Canyon Houdini Estate | publisher=[[John Cox and Patrick Culliton]] | access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref>

In 1918, he registered for [[Selective Service System|selective service]] as Harry Handcuff Houdini.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.archives.gov/atlanta/wwi-draft/houdini.html| title=Notable Registrants of the World War I Draft: Harry Houdini | publisher=[[National Archives and Records Administration]] | access-date=November 9, 2015}}</ref>

==Death==
[[File:Harry Houdini and his wife.jpg|thumb|upright|Houdini and his wife [[Bess Houdini|Bess]]]]
Harry Houdini died of [[peritonitis]], secondary to a [[appendicitis|ruptured appendix]], at 1:26&nbsp;p.m. on October 31, 1926, in Room 401 at Detroit's Grace Hospital, aged 52. In his final days, he believed that he would recover, but his last words before dying were reportedly, "I'm tired of fighting... I do not want to fight anymore..."<ref name="secret"/>

Witnesses to an incident at Houdini's dressing room in the Princess Theatre in [[Montreal]] speculated that Houdini's death was caused by Jocelyn Gordon Whitehead (November 25, 1895 – July 5, 1954), who repeatedly struck Houdini's abdomen.<ref name=Snopes>{{cite web| last=Mikkelson| first=Barbara and David P.| date=September 2, 2014| title=Punched Out| url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/freakish/houdini.asp| website=[[Snopes.com]]}}</ref>

The accounts of the witnesses, students named Jacques Price and Sam Smilovitz (sometimes called Jack Price and Sam Smiley), generally corroborated one another. Price said that Whitehead asked Houdini "if he believed in the miracles of the Bible" and "whether it was true that punches in the stomach did not hurt him". Houdini offered a casual reply that his stomach could endure a lot. Whitehead then delivered "some very hammer-like blows below the belt". Houdini was reclining on a couch at the time, having broken his ankle while performing several days earlier. Price said that Houdini winced at each blow and stopped Whitehead suddenly in the midst of a punch, gesturing that he had had enough, and adding that he had had no opportunity to prepare himself against the blows, as he did not expect Whitehead to strike him so suddenly and forcefully. Had his ankle not been broken, he would have risen from the couch into a better position to brace himself.<ref name=Snopes/><ref>{{cite book| title=Edge of the Unknown| last=Conan Doyle| first=Arthur| url=https://www.amazon.com/Edge-Sir-Arthur-Conan-Doyle/dp/B00AZSCMA8/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1447096312&sr=1-1&keywords=edge+of+the+unknown&pebp=1447096314933&perid=0P11K5GHK33608SN7VBH#reader_B00AZSCMA8| year=1930| isbn=978-1409235149}}</ref>

Throughout the evening, Houdini performed in great pain. He was unable to sleep and remained in constant pain for the next two days, but did not seek medical help. When he finally saw a doctor, he was found to have a fever of {{convert|102|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and acute [[appendicitis]], and was advised to have immediate surgery. He ignored the advice and decided to go on with the show.<ref name="autogenerated3">{{cite book| title=The Man Who Killed Houdini| first=Don| last=Bell| publisher=[[Véhicule Press]]| date=September 28, 2005| isbn=978-1550651874}}</ref><ref name=Benoit>{{cite book| last=Benoit| first=Tod| title=Where Are They Buried?

Despite the diagnosis, Houdini took the stage. He was reported to have passed out during the show, but was revived and continued. Afterwards, he was hospitalized at Detroit's [[Sinai-Grace Hospital#History|Grace Hospital]].<ref name=Snopes/>

It is unclear whether the dressing room incident caused Houdini's eventual death, as the relationship between blunt trauma and appendicitis is uncertain.<ref name=Snopes/> One theory suggests that Houdini was unaware that he was suffering from appendicitis, and might have been aware had he not received blows to the abdomen.<ref name=Snopes/>

After taking statements from Price and Smilovitz, Houdini's insurance company concluded that the death was due to the dressing-room incident and paid [[double indemnity]].<ref name="autogenerated3" />

==Houdini grave site==
Houdini's funeral was held on November 4, 1926, in New York, with more than 2,000 mourners in attendance.<ref>{{cite news| last=Goldenberg| first=Suzanne| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/mar/24/usa.suzannegoldenberg1| title=Final Escape for the Master of Illusion?

A statuary bust was added to the [[exedra]] in 1927, a rarity, because graven images are forbidden in Jewish cemeteries. In 1975, the bust was destroyed by vandals. Temporary busts were placed at the grave until 2011 when a group who came to be called The self-named Houdini Commandos, from the [[Houdini Museum]] in [[Scranton]], Pennsylvania, placed a permanent bust with the permission of Houdini's family and of the cemetery.<ref name="Houdini Returns">{{cite news |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/24/houdini-returns-of-course/ |title=Houdini Returns |access-date=October 24, 2011 | work=[[The New York Times]] |first=David W. |last=Dunlap |date=October 24, 2011}}</ref>

The Society of American Magicians took responsibility for the upkeep of the site, as Houdini had willed a large sum of money to the organization he had grown from one club to 5,000–6,000 dues-paying membership worldwide. The payment of upkeep was abandoned by the society's dean [[George Schindler]], who said "Houdini paid for perpetual care, but there's nobody at the cemetery to provide it", adding that the operator of the cemetery, David Jacobson, "sends us a bill for upkeep every year but we never pay it because he never provides any care." Members of the Society tidy the grave themselves.<ref name="Houdini's Final Trick">{{cite news |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/31/houdinis-final-trick-a-tidy-grave/ |title=Houdini's Final Trick, a Tidy Grave |access-date=October 31, 2008 | work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Corey |last=Kilgannon |date=October 31, 2008}}</ref>

Machpelah Cemetery operator Jacobson said that they "never paid the cemetery for any restoration of the Houdini family plot in my tenure since 1988", claiming that the money came from the cemetery's dwindling funds.

He is not only a magical icon; his gravesite bears the seal of The Society of American Magicians. That seal is our brand and we should be proud to protect it.

The Houdini Gravesite Restoration Committee under the Chairmanship of National President David Bowers, is working closely with National President Kenrick "Ice" McDonald to see this project to completion. Bowers said it is a foregone conclusion that the Society will approve the funding request, because  "Houdini is responsible for the Society of American Magicians being what it is today. We owe a debt of gratitude to him." Like Bowers, McDonald said the motivation behind the repairs is to properly honor the grave of the "Babe Ruth of magicians". "This is hallowed ground," he said. "When you ask people about magicians, the first thing they say is Harry Houdini." While the actual plot will remain under the control of Machpelah Cemetery management, the Society of American Magicians, with the help of the Houdini Museum in Pennsylvania, will be in charge of the restoration.<ref name="Houdini's gravesite to get a magic fix in Queens">{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/queens/houdini-queens-grave-site-magic-fix-article-1.1989172 |title=Houdini's gravesite to get a magic fix in Queens |access-date=October 27, 2014 | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York |first=Eli |last=Rosenberg |date=October 27, 2014}}</ref>

Magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz have been caring for the escape artist's Queens grave over the years.  "This is a monument where people go and visit on a daily basis," said Dietrich who is spearheading restoration efforts. "The nearly 80-year-old popular plot at the Machpelah Cemetery has fallen into disrepair over the years."  "The Houdini Museum has teamed with The Society of American Magicians, one of the oldest fraternal magic organizations in the world, to give the beloved site a facelift."  The organization has a specific Houdini gravesite committee made up of nine members headed up by President elect David Bowers who brought this project to the Society's attention.

Kenrick "Ice" McDonald, the current president of the Society of American Magicians said, "You have to know the history. Houdini served as President from 1917 until his death in 1926. Houdini's burial site needs an infusion of cash to restore it to its former glory." Magician Dietrich said the repairs could cost "tens of thousands of dollars", after consulting with glass experts and grave artisans. "It's a wonderful project, but it's taken a lifetime to get people interested," she said. "It's long overdue, and it's great that it's happening." Houdini was a living superhero," Dietrich said. "He wasn't just a magician and escape artist, he was a great humanitarian." To this day, the Society holds a [[broken wand ceremony]] at the grave every November.

Houdini's widow, [[Bess Houdini|Bess]], died of a [[heart attack]] on February 11, 1943, aged 67, in [[Needles, California]], while on a train en route from Los Angeles to New York City. She had expressed a wish to be buried next to her husband, but instead was interred 35&nbsp;miles due north at the [[Gate of Heaven Cemetery]] in [[Westchester County, New York]], as her [[Catholic]] family refused to allow her to be buried in a Jewish cemetery.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://houdini.net/besshoudinideath.php |title=Bess Houdini dies in 1943 |publisher=Houdini.net |access-date=April 1, 2011}}</ref>

===Proposed exhumation===
On March 22, 2007, Houdini's grand-nephew (the grandson of his brother Theo), George Hardeen, announced that the courts would be asked to allow [[exhumation]] of Houdini's body, to investigate the possibility of Houdini being murdered by spiritualists, as suggested in the biography ''The Secret Life of Houdini''.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/grandnephew-seeks-to-set-record-straight-about-houdini-s-death-1.660397 |title=Grandnephew seeks to 'set record straight' about Houdini's death |publisher=[[CBC News]] |access-date=March 23, 2007 |date=March 23, 2007}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Houdini's brother, [[Theodore Hardeen]], who returned to performing after Houdini's death, inherited his brother's effects and props. Houdini's will stipulated that all the effects should be "burned and destroyed" upon Hardeen's death. Hardeen sold much of the collection to magician and Houdini enthusiast [[Sidney Hollis Radner]] during the 1940s, including the water torture cell.<ref>{{cite news |title=With Sadness, Prime Houdini Artifact Collector Puts Items on Auction Block |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/29/us/with-sadness-houdini-artifact-collector-puts-it-on-the-auction-block.html |access-date=24 March 2020 |quote= ... Mr. Radner, aka Rendar the Magician, owns one of the world's biggest and most valuable collections of Harry Houdini artifacts, including the Chinese Water Torture Cell, one of Houdini's signature props from 1912 until his death in 1926. Most of the items were given to Mr. Radner in the 1940s by Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen. Hardeen considered Radner, then a student at Yale with a reputation for jumping from diving boards in handcuffs, as his protégé. Until early this year, the collection was on display at the Outagamie Museum in Appleton, Wisconsin, where Houdini's father was the town rabbi in the 1870s. But after a rancorous falling out between Mr. Radner and museum officials, the 1,000-piece collection was packed-up and shipped here, where it will be auctioned on Saturday in the windowless back room at the Liberace Museum and on eBay. |work=The New York Times |date=October 29, 2004}}</ref> Radner allowed choice pieces of the collection to be displayed at The Houdini Magical Hall of Fame in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]]. In 1995, a fire destroyed the museum. The water torture cell's metal frame remained, and it was restored by illusion builder John Gaughan.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wildabouthoudini.com/2007/02/mystery-of-two-torture-cells.html |title=The Mystery of the Two Torture Cells |access-date=May 14, 2007 |work=Wild About Harry}}</ref> Many of the props contained in the museum such as the mirror handcuffs, Houdini's original packing crate, a milk can, and a straitjacket, survived the fire and were auctioned in 1999 and 2008.

Radner loaned the bulk of his collection for archiving to the [[History Museum at the Castle|Outagamie Museum]] in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], but reclaimed it in 2003 and auctioned it in Las Vegas, on October 30, 2004.<ref name="houdini">{{cite web| url=http://www.houdini.com/houdiniauction.htm| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515020225/http://www.houdini.com/houdiniauction.htm| url-status=dead| archive-date=May 15, 2006| title=Houdini&#039;s Magic Shop &#124; Novelties| publisher=houdini.com| access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

Houdini was a "formidable collector", and bequeathed many of his holdings and paper archives on magic and spiritualism to the [[Library of Congress]], which became the basis for the Houdini collection in cyberspace.<ref name="Higbee">{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/970224/houdini.html |title=Great Escapes |work=American Memory Web Site, Hosts Houdini Collection |first1=Joan |last1=Higbee |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |access-date=March 24, 2011}}</ref>

In 1934, the bulk of Houdini's collection of American and British theatrical material, along with a significant portion of his business and personal papers, and some of his collections of other magicians were sold to pay off estate debts to theatre magnate Messmore Kendall. In 1958, Kendall donated his collection to the Hoblitzelle Theatre Library at the [[University of Texas at Austin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/collections/performingarts/info/|title=The Performing Arts Collection|website=hrc.utexas.edu|access-date=March 15, 2017}}</ref> In the 1960s, the Hoblitzelle Library became part of the [[Harry Ransom Center]].

A large portion of Houdini's estate holdings and memorabilia was willed to his fellow magician and friend, [[John Mulholland (magician)|John Mulholland]] (1898–1970). In 1991, illusionist and television performer [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]] purchased all of Mulholland's Houdini holdings from Mulholland's estate. These are now archived and preserved in Copperfield's warehouse at his headquarters in Las Vegas. It contains the world's largest collection of Houdini memorabilia, and preserves approximately 80,000 items of memorabilia of Houdini and other magicians, including Houdini's stage props and material, his rebuilt water torture cabinet and his metamorphosis trunk. It is not open to the public, but tours are available by invitation to magicians, scholars, researchers, journalists and serious collectors.

In a posthumous ceremony on October 31, 1975, Houdini was given a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 7001 Hollywood Blvd.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkoffame.com/harry-houdini |title=Harry Houdini |work=walkoffame.com |access-date=May 13, 2015 |publisher=Hollywood Chamber of Commerce |quote=Address: 7001 Hollywood Blvd. Ceremony: October 31, 1975.}}</ref>

The [[Houdini Museum]] in Scranton, Pennsylvania, bills itself as "the only building in the world entirely dedicated to Houdini". It is open to the public year-round by reservation. It includes Houdini films, a guided tour about Houdini's life and a stage magic show. Magicians Dorothy Dietrich and Dick Brookz opened the facility in 1991.

[[The Magic Castle]] in Los Angeles, California, a nightclub for magicians and magic enthusiasts, as well as the clubhouse for the [[Academy of Magical Arts]], features Houdini séances performed by magician [[Misty Lee]].

[[The House of Houdini]] is a museum and performance venue located at 11, Dísz square in the Buda Castle in Budapest, Hungary. It claims to house the largest collection of original Houdini artifacts in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.houseofhoudinibudapest.com/ |title=House of Houdini Official website |publisher=The House of Houdini |access-date=January 22, 2017}}</ref>

The [[Houdini Museum of New York]] is located at Fantasma Magic, a retail magic manufacturer and seller located in Manhattan. The museum contains several hundred pieces of ephemera, most of which belonged to Harry Houdini.

== In popular culture ==
* Houdini appeared as himself in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' magazine in three ghostwritten fictionalizations of sensational events from his career (issues of March, April, and May–June–July 1924). The third story, "[[Imprisoned with the Pharaohs]]," was written by horror writer [[H. P. Lovecraft]] based on Houdini's notes. The Houdini-Lovecraft collaboration was envisioned to continue, but the magazine ceased publication for financial reasons. When it resumed later in 1924, Houdini no longer figured in its plans.<ref>"The Magician's Ghostwriters" in ''The Thing's Incredible!
