'''Blackstreet''' (often stylized as '''BLACKstreet''') is an American R&B group founded in 1991 by [[music producer|record producers]] Chauncey "Black" Hannibal, and [[Teddy Riley|Teddy "Street" Riley]]. The group has released four albums with [[Interscope Records]] until 2003. They achieved relative success leading up to the single "[[No Diggity]]" (featuring [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Queen Pen]]), which peaked at number 1 for four weeks in November 1996. 


==Formation==
After the breakup of [[Guy (band)|Guy]], Riley came up with the idea to start a new group featuring himself. Originally, the group was to be named Stonestreet, but it was later decided to combine Stonestreet with Chauncey's nickname "Black". The group became Blackstreet Featuring Teddy Riley, with an original lineup of Riley, Chauncey Hannibal, Levi Little, and Joseph Stonestreet. However, Stonestreet was replaced with [[Dave Hollister]] before the first self-titled album was released.

==Career==
In 1993, their first single "Baby Be Mine" was released on the soundtrack to the [[Universal Pictures]] comedy ''[[CB4]]'' (starring [[Chris Rock]]). The song was written by Riley and Stonestreet and produced by Riley.<ref name="Huey">Huey, Steve "[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blackstreet-p37454/biography Blackstreet Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706063820/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/blackstreet-p37454/biography |date=2011-07-06 }}", [[AllMusic]], retrieved July 10, 2011.</ref>

Their debut album, ''[[Blackstreet (album)|Blackstreet]],'' featured the singles "Booti Call", "[[Before I Let You Go]]" and "Joy".<ref name="Huey" /> "Booti Call" and "Before I Let You Go" were both Top 40 hits, with "Before I Let You Go" hitting the Top 10. In 1996, they released their second album ''[[Another Level (Blackstreet album)|Another Level]].'' It was a breakthrough success due to the top single "[[No Diggity]]" (with [[Dr. Dre]]), which was a No. 1 hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in November 1996. In 1998, Blackstreet won the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].<ref name="Huey" />

''Another Level'' eventually went four times platinum in the United States and peaked at No. 3 on the ''Billboard'' chart. "No Diggity" was later ranked at No. 91 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and [[MTV]]: 100 Greatest Pop Songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/rsmtv100a.htm|title=Rock On The Net: Rolling Stone & MTV: 100 Greatest Pop Songs: 51-100|work=rockonthenet.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100806074746/http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/rsmtv100a.htm|archive-date=August 6, 2010}}</ref> ''Another Level'' featured Mark Middleton and Eric Williams in place of Dave Hollister and Levi Little.<ref name="Huey" /> Both Middleton and Williams were in groups prior to joining Blackstreet.

The success of ''Another Level'' would also land them a spot on [[New Edition]]'s 1997 [[Home Again (New Edition album)|Home Again]] reunion tour.

Blackstreet had a top ten album with ''[[Finally (Blackstreet album)|Finally]].'' The first single from the album, "[[Girlfriend/Boyfriend]]", was a collaboration with [[Janet Jackson]] featuring [[Ja Rule]] and [[Eve (entertainer)|Eve]]. Riley recorded a reunion album with Guy in 2000 and subsequently began working on material for his first solo record. Riley had second thoughts about disbanding Blackstreet and patched things up with Hannibal. Middleton and Williams returned to restore the ''Another Level'' lineup, and Riley's solo project became a Blackstreet reunion. After rumors of legal action and a preemptive countersuit, the group re-banded and released ''[[Level II (Blackstreet album)|Level II]].''

After several failed attempts to keep Blackstreet together, all members eventually continued with solo careers for a time. However, in 2014 it was announced that past members Black, Little, Middleton, and Williams were back together under the Blackstreet moniker. They continued to perform with this lineup currently, and embarked on their second Australian tour in April 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2015/02/13/the-hi-fi-venues-enter-administration/|title=EXCLUSIVE: The Hi-Fi Bar Venues Enter Administration|work=theMusic}}</ref>

In 2015, three ex-members, Mark Middleton, Eric Williams and Jeremy Hanna were backing vocals for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]] North Macedonia entry "[[Autumn Leaves (Daniel Kajmakoski song)|Autumn Leaves]]" performed by [[Daniel Kajmakoski]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-05-06|title=Daniel Kajmakoski will be joined by Grammy winners MERJ|url=https://eurovisionary.com/daniel-kajmakoski-will-be-joined-by-grammy-winners-merj/|access-date=2021-10-13|website=EuroVisionary|language=en-GB}}</ref>
