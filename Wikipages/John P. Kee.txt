'''John P. Kee''' (born '''John Prince Kee''' on June 4, 1962) is an American [[gospel music|gospel]] singer and pastor.

==Early life==

John P. Kee was born on June 4, 1962 [[Durham, North Carolina]]. At an early age he began developing his musical talent both instrumentally and vocally. He attended the [[North Carolina School of the Arts]] in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] and at 14, he and his brothers, Wayne and Al, moved to California, where he began attending the Yuba College Conservatory School of Music in [[Marysville, California]]. During this time, he began playing with various groups such as [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]] and [[Donald Byrd]] and the Blackbyrds. After having a hard time adjusting in California, he left and moved to [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] only to find himself living in a part of the city known for its violence and drug activities. After watching one of his friends being murdered in a drug deal gone bad, he rededicated his life back to God during a visitation to a [[revival meeting]].


==Ministry==

Kee says that it was during a trip to Michigan with his choir that he received a calling from God to be a preacher. Kee was in his mid-twenties when he became an ordained minister. In 1995, while ministering in Ohio, he received a prophetic vision and went forward with the building of a Fellowship Center in Charlotte which could minister to the people in the community. He officially founded the New Life Fellowship Center where he became and remains the senior pastor. The church is located in the same area where he had once led a life of crime and drugs.

==Musical career==

In the mid-1980s, Kee formed a community choir in Charlotte known as the New Life Community Choir or "NLCC." Over time the choir grew in popularity and has continued to travel throughout the area. The choir also includes Kee's own children.

In 1990, Kee founded the Victory in Praise Music and Arts Seminar Mass Choir, or "V.I.P." to fellowship with various ministries, songwriters, musicians and choir directors from all over the country.

Kee has been active for more than 20 years in the music field. He is primarily known for mixing traditional gospel with modern contemporary gospel and for having a soulful husky voice. In 2007, Kee was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame.<ref name="titleWelcome to the Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum.">{{cite web|url=http://hallmuseum.com/induction.htm |title=Welcome to the Christian Music Hall of Fame and Museum. |access-date=February 19, 2008 |publisher=Christian Music Hall of Fame |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090819062030/http://hallmuseum.com/induction.htm |archive-date=August 19, 2009 }}John P Kee inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame</ref>

Kee is also known as "The Prince of Gospel Music".

==Personal life==
In December 1995, Kee married Felice Sampson, and they are the parents of nine children. His son, Christopher Kee, was recently selected to join [[Sean P. Diddy Combs]]' live band as a drummer for his upcoming tour for the "Last Train to Paris".
