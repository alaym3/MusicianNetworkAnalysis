'''Public broadcasting''' involves [[radio]], [[television]] and other electronic media outlets whose primary mission is [[public service]]. In many countries of the world, [[government funding|funding]] comes from governments, especially via annual [[Broadcasting license fee|fee]]s charged on receivers.

Public broadcasting may be nationally or locally operated, depending on the country and the station. In some countries a single organization runs public broadcasting. Other countries have multiple public-broadcasting organizations operating regionally or in different languages. Historically, public broadcasting was once the dominant or only form of broadcasting in many countries (with the notable exceptions of the United States, Mexico and Brazil). [[Commercial broadcasting]] now also exists in most of these countries; the number of countries with only public broadcasting declined substantially during the latter part of the 20th century.{{Citation needed|date= August 2011}}

Public-sector media (state-funded) is not to be confused with [[state media]] (state-controlled), which is "controlled financially ''and'' editorially by the state."<ref name="DavidWebster">Webster, David. [http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/state/freedom1.htm Building Free and Independent Media] (August 1992).</ref>

==Definition==
The primary mission of public broadcasting is that of public service, speaking to and engaging as a citizen.<ref name=unesco>{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting – Why, How?|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001240/124058eo.pdf|publisher=UNESCO & World Radio and Television Council|access-date=17 August 2011}}</ref> The British model has been widely accepted as a universal definition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nosuch-research.co.uk/pppp.html|title=BRU definition of public service broadcasting|access-date=13 October 2014}}</ref><ref name=raboy>{{cite book|last=Raboy|first=Marc|title=Public broadcasting for the 21st century|year=1995|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=1-86020-006-0|pages=6–10}}</ref><ref name=psbGlobal>{{cite book|last=Banerjee|first=Indrajit|title=Public service broadcasting in the age of globalization|year=2006|publisher=Asian Media Information and Communication Centre (AMIC)|isbn=981-4136-01-8}}</ref> The model embodies the following principles:

* Universal geographic accessibility
* Universal appeal
* Attention to minorities
* Contribution to national identity and sense of community
* Distance from vested interests
* Direct funding and universality of payment
* Competition in good programming rather than numbers
* Guidelines that liberate rather than restrict

While application of certain principles may be straightforward, as in the case of accessibility, some of the principles may be poorly defined or difficult to implement. In the context of a shifting national identity, the role of public broadcasting may be unclear. Likewise, the subjective nature of good programming may raise the question of individual or public taste.<ref name=raboy/>

Within public broadcasting there are two different views regarding commercial activity. One is that public broadcasting is incompatible with commercial objectives. The other is that public broadcasting can and should compete in the marketplace with commercial broadcasters. This dichotomy is highlighted by the public service aspects of traditional commercial broadcasters.<ref name=raboy/>

Public broadcasters in each jurisdiction may or may not be synonymous with government controlled broadcasters. In some countries like the UK public broadcasters are not sanctioned by government departments and have independent means of funding, and thus enjoy editorial independence.

==Technology==
Public broadcasting utilizes [[AM broadcasting|AM]] and [[FM broadcasting|FM]] [[radio]], [[television]], and [[internet]] technologies.

==Economics==
Public broadcasters may receive their funding from an obligatory [[television licence]] fee, individual contributions, government funding or commercial sources. Public broadcasters do not rely on advertising to the same degree as commercial broadcasters, or at all; this allows public broadcasters to transmit programmes that are not commercially viable to the [[mass market]], such as [[Public affairs (broadcasting)|public affairs]] shows, [[radio documentary|radio]] and [[documentary film|television documentaries]], and [[educational programme]]s.

One of the principles of public broadcasting is to provide coverage of interests for which there are missing or small markets. Public broadcasting attempts to supply topics of social benefit that are otherwise not provided by commercial broadcasters. Typically, such underprovision is argued to exist when the benefits to viewers are relatively high in comparison to the benefits to advertisers from contacting viewers.<ref name=andcoate /> This frequently is the case in undeveloped countries that normally have low benefits to advertising.<ref name=andcoate>{{cite journal|author1=Simon P. Anderson|author2=Stephen Coate|title=Market Provision of Broadcasting: A Welfare Analysis|journal=[[The Review of Economic Studies]]|date=October 2005|volume=72|issue=4|pages=947–972 |doi=10.1111/0034-6527.00357 }}</ref>

==Cultural policy==
Additionally, public broadcasting may facilitate the implementation of a [[cultural policy]] (an [[industrial policy]] and [[investment policy]] for culture). Examples include:

*The Canadian government is committed to [[Canadian official bilingualism|official bilingualism]] (English and French). As a result, the public broadcaster, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] employs translators and journalists who speak both official languages and it encourages production of cross-cultural material.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} 
*In the UK, the [[BBC]] supports multiculturalism and diversity, in part by using on-screen commentators and hosts of different ethnic origins. There are also [[Welsh language|Welsh]], Irish and Scottish Gaelic language programmes for the home nations, an Asian Network broadcasting in English and five major languages of South Asia, and the BBC World Service broadcasts in 31 international languages, also funded independently of government.
*In New Zealand, the public broadcasting system provides support to [[Māori people|Māori]] broadcasting, with the stated intention of improving their opportunities, maintaining their cultural heritage and promoting their language.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
*In Australia, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] is legally required to 'encourage and promote the musical, dramatic and other performing arts in Australia' and 'broadcasting programmes that contribute to a sense of national identity' with specific emphasis on regional and rural Australia'.<ref>Charter of the Corporation (ABC). [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/ABCcharter.htm Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983: Section 6].</ref> Furthermore, the [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) is intended to reflect the spirit and sense of multicultural richness and the unique international cultural values within Australian society.

==Worldwide==
The model, established in the 1920s, of the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (the BBC)—an organisation widely trusted, even by citizens of the [[Axis Powers]]{{according to whom|date=March 2020}} during World War II—was widely emulated throughout Europe, the [[British Empire]], and later the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The public broadcasters in a number of countries are basically an application of the model used in Britain.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Modern public broadcasting is often a mixed commercial model. For example, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] is funded by advertising revenue supplemented by a government subsidy to support its television service.

===Americas===

====Argentina====
State presence in television had a strong history, not in the way of European style public service radio or television.
The private sector has taken an active role in the development of television in Buenos Aires. In opposition, state broadcasters tend to be federal and technical innovative, such as the
[[Televisión Pública Argentina]], the first national TV station, 68 years old.

====Brazil====
In Brazil, the two main national public broadcasters are [[Brazil Communication Company]] ({{lang-pt|Empresa Brasil de Comunicação; EBC}}) and the [[Father Anchieta Foundation]] ({{lang-pt|Fundação Padre Anchieta; FPA}}). EBC was created in 2007 to manage the Brazilian federal government's radio and television stations. EBC owns broadcast the television channel [[TV Brasil]] (launched in 2007, being the merger of TVE Brasil (formerly, Rio de Janeiro Educational Television), launched in [[Rio de Janeiro]] in 1975 and TV Nacional, launched in [[Brasília|Brasilia]] in 1960), and the radio stations [[Rádio Nacional|Nacional]] and [[Radio MEC]], broadcast in Brasilia and Rio de Janeiro. The [[Father Anchieta Foundation|FPA]] was created by the government of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] in 1967 and includes a national educational public television network ([[TV Cultura]], launched in 1969 in [[São Paulo]], which is available in all [[Federative units of Brazil|Brazilian states]] through its 135 afilliates),<ref>{{cite web |title=Cobertura |url=https://fpa.com.br/cobertura/?_ga=2.197406502.884143948.1634790296-699539558.1634790296 |website=Padre Anchieta Foundation |access-date=21 October 2021 |language=pt-BR}}</ref> two radio stations ([[Rádio Cultura]] FM and Rádio Cultura Brasil, both broadcasting to [[Greater São Paulo]]), two educational TV channels aimed at [[distance education]] (TV Educação and Univesp TV, which is available on free-to-air digital TV in São Paulo and nationally by cable and satellite), and the children's TV channel [[TV Rá-Tim-Bum]], available nationally on pay TV. Father Anchieta Foundation is a [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit organization]] which maintains financial and administrative autonomy.

Many Brazilian states also have regional and statewide public radio and television stations. One example is [[Minas Gerais]], which has the EMC (Minas Gerais Communication Company; in {{lang-pt|Empresa Mineira de Comunicação}}), a public corporation created in 2016, formed by Rede Minas, a statewide television network and the two AM and FM stations of [[Rádio Inconfidência]]. In the state of [[Pará]], the state-funded foundation FUNTELPA (Pará Broadcasting Foundation) operates the public educational state-wide television network Rede Cultura do Pará (which covers the entire state of Pará, reaching many cities of [[Amazônia Legal|Brazilian Amazon]]) and the FM radio station Radio Cultura (which broadcasts for [[Belém]]). The state of [[Espírito Santo]] has the RTV-ES (Espírito Santo Radio and Television), with its television channel TVE-ES (Espirito Santo Educational Television) and an AM radio station (''Radio Espírito Santo''), and in [[Rio Grande do Sul]], the state-wide public television channel TVE-RS (Rio Grande do Sul Educational Television; in {{lang-pt|TV Educativa do Rio Grande do Sul}}) and the public radio station FM Cultura (which broadcasts for [[Porto Alegre]] metropolitan area). Regional public television channels in Brazil often broadcast part of TV Brasil or TV Cultura programming among with some hours of local programming.

Since the government of [[Michel Temer]], EBC has received several criticism from some politicians for having an alleged political bias.<ref name="oglobo">{{cite news |title=EBC virou 'cabide de emprego' e símbolo de aparelhamento político, diz ministro |url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/ebc-virou-cabide-de-emprego-simbolo-de-aparelhamento-politico-diz-ministro-19487534 |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=O Globo |date=11 June 2016 |language=pt-BR}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Com desenho animado e programas chapa-branca, para que serve a TV Brasil? {{!}} Tela Plana |url=https://veja.abril.com.br/blog/tela-plana/com-desenho-animado-e-programas-chapa-branca-para-que-serve-a-tv-brasil/ |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=Veja |language=pt-BR}}</ref> The current president of Brazil, [[Jair Bolsonaro]], said in his campaign for the [[Brazilian presidential election, 2018|presidential election in 2018]] that the public broadcaster is allegedly a "job hanger" (public company existing only for the purpose of securing positions for political allies) and has proposed to privatize or extinguish the public company.<ref>{{cite news |title=Promessa de campanha, privatização da EBC fica para depois de 2022 {{!}} Radar Econômico |url=https://veja.abril.com.br/blog/radar-economico/promessa-de-campanha-privatizacao-da-ebc-fica-para-proximo-presidente/ |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=Veja |language=pt-BR}}</ref> On April 9, 2021, the president inserted the public company into the National Privatization Program, with the intention of carrying out studies about the possibility of privatization of the public broadcaster.<ref>{{cite news |title=EBC e Eletrobras são incluídas no programa de privatização |url=https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/radioagencia-nacional/politica/audio/2021-04/ebc-e-eletrobras-sao-incluidas-no-programa-de-privatizacao |access-date=10 April 2021 |work=Agência Brasil |publisher=EBC |date=10 April 2021 |language=pt-br}}</ref> Some states often had problems with their public broadcasting services.

====Canada====
{{see also|Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}
In Canada, the main public broadcaster is the national [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC; {{lang-fr|Société Radio-Canada}}), a [[state-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] – which originated as a radio network in November 1936. It is the successor to the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC), which was established by the administration of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[R.B. Bennett]] in 1932, modeled on recommendations made in 1929 by the [[Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting]] and stemming from lobbying efforts by the [[Canadian Radio League]]. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation took over operation of the CRBC's nine radio stations (which were largely concentrated in major cities across Canada, including [[Toronto]], [[Vancouver]], [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]]). The CBC eventually expanded to television in September 1952 with the sign-on of [[CBFT-DT|CBFT]] in Montreal; CBFT was the first television station in Canada to initiate full-time broadcasts, which initially served as a primary affiliate of the French language Télévision de Radio-Canada and a secondary affiliate of the [[Canadian English|English language]] CBC Television service.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Birth and Death of The Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission (1932-1936)|url=https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/listing_and_histories/birth-and-death-canadian-radio-broadcasting-commission-1932-1936|website=[[Canadian Communications Foundation]]|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref>

CBC operates two national television networks ([[CBC Television]] and [[Ici Radio-Canada Télé]]), four radio networks ([[CBC Radio One]], [[CBC Radio 2]], [[Ici Radio-Canada Première]] and [[Ici Musique]]) and several cable television channels including two 24-hour news channels ([[CBC News Network]] and [[Ici RDI]]) in both of Canada's official languages – English and French – and the French-language channels [[Ici Explora]] and [[Ici ARTV]], dedicated to science and culture respectively. CBC's national television operations and some radio operations are funded partly by advertisements, in addition to the subsidy provided by the federal government. The cable channels are commercial entities owned and operated by the CBC and do not receive any direct public funds, however, they do benefit from synergies with resources from the other CBC operations. The CBC has frequently dealt with budget cuts and labour disputes, often resulting in a debate about whether the service has the resources necessary to properly fulfill its mandate.

{{As of|2017}}, all of CBC Television's terrestrial stations are [[owned-and-operated station|owned and operated]] by the CBC directly. The number of privately owned CBC Television affiliates has gradually declined in recent years, as the network has moved its programming to stations opened by the corporation or has purchased certain affiliates from private broadcasting groups; budgetary issues led the CBC to choose not to launch new rebroadcast transmitters in markets where the network disaffiliated from a private station after 2006; the network dropped its remaining private affiliates in 2016, when [[CJDC-TV]]/[[Dawson Creek]] and [[CFTK-TV]]/[[Terrace, British Columbia]] defected from CBC Television that February and [[Lloydminster]]-based [[CKSA-DT]] disaffiliated in August of that year (to become affiliates of [[CTV Two]] and [[Global Television Network|Global]], respectively). The CBC's decision to disaffiliate from these and other privately owned stations, as well as the corporation decommissioning its network of rebroadcasters following [[Digital terrestrial television in Canada|Canada's transition to digital television]] in August 2011 have significantly reduced the terrestrial coverage of both CBC Television and Ici Radio-Canada Télé; the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) does require cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry CBC and Radio-Canada stations as part of their basic tier, regardless of terrestrial availability in an individual market.<ref>{{cite web|title=Broadcast Distribution Regulations (ss. 17(d) and 17(f))|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/sor-97-555/FullText.html#s-17|website=Justice Laws Website|publisher=[[Department of Justice (Canada)|Department of Justice]]|date=February 28, 2014|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref> Of the three major French-language television networks in Canada, Ici Radio-Canada Télé is the only one that maintains terrestrial owned-and-operated stations and affiliates in all ten [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian provinces]], although it maintains only one station ([[Moncton, New Brunswick]]-based [[CBAFT-DT]]) that serves the four provinces comprising [[Atlantic Canada]].

In recent years, the CBC has also expanded into [[new media]] ventures including the online radio service [[CBC Radio 3]], [[music streaming]] service [[CBC Music]], and the launch of online news services, such as [[CBC Hamilton]], in some markets which are not directly served by their own CBC television or radio stations.

In addition, several provinces operate public broadcasters; these are not CBC subentities, but distinct networks in their own right. Most of the provincial services maintain an educational programming format, differing from the primarily entertainment-based CBC/Radio-Canada operations, but more closely formatted to (and carrying many of the same programs as) the U.S.-based [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), which itself is available terrestrially and – under a CRTC rule that requires Canadian cable, satellite and IPTV providers to carry affiliates of the four major U.S. commercial networks ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]) and a PBS member station<ref>{{cite news|title=Canadian cablecos to do the FOX trot.|newspaper=Alberta Report / Newsmagazine|page=43|date=September 12, 1994}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Canada-U.S. cross-border station shake-up|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/canada-cross-border-station-shake-87165|author=Etan Vlessing|agency=Associated Press|periodical=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Nielsen Holdings|The Nielsen Company]]|date=July 31, 2009|access-date=June 23, 2017}}</ref> – through pay television providers in Canada via member stations located near the [[Canada–United States border|U.S.–Canada border]]. These educational public broadcasters include the English-language [[TVOntario]] (TVO) and the French-language [[TFO]] in [[Ontario]], [[Télé-Québec]] in [[Quebec]], and [[Knowledge Network]] in [[British Columbia]]. TVO and Télé-Québec operate through conventional transmitters and cable, while TFO and Knowledge Network are cable-only channels. Beyond these and other provincial services, Canada does not have a national public educational network.

[[File:CJAI-islandradio-summer2010.jpg|thumb|right|Amherst Island public radio]]
Canada is also home to a number of former public broadcasting entities that have gone private. [[CTV Two Alberta]], which is licensed as an educational television station in Alberta, was once owned by the [[Government of Alberta|Alberta government]] as the public broadcaster Access. In 1993, the provincial government agreed to cease to direct funding of Access after the 1994 fiscal year; the channel was sold to [[CHUM Limited]] in 1995, which initially acquired the channel through a majority-owned subsidiary, Learning and Skills Television of Alberta Limited (LSTA).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1995/DB95-472.HTM|title=Decision CRTC 95-472|publisher=CRTC|date=1995-07-20|access-date=2011-09-03}}</ref> To fulfill its license conditions as an educational station, it broadcasts educational and children's programming during the [[daytime television|daytime]] hours, while airing entertainment programming favoured by advertisers and viewers in prime time. The service discontinued its broadcast transmitters in [[Calgary]] and [[Edmonton]] in August 2011, due to the expense of transitioning the two stations to [[Digital terrestrial television|digital]], and the fact that the service had mandatory carriage on television providers serving Alberta regardless of whether it ran over-the-air transmitters. The service has since operated as part of [[Bell Media]]'s [[CTV Two]] chain of stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://services.crtc.gc.ca/pub/DocWebBroker/OpenDocument.aspx?AppNo=201012616|title=Applicant response dated 6 December 2010|access-date=2011-03-17}}</ref>

Public radio station [[CKUA Radio Network|CKUA]] in Alberta was also formerly operated by Access, before being sold to the [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit]] CKUA Radio Foundation which continues to operate it as a community-funded radio network. [[CJRT-FM]] in Toronto also operated as a public government-owned radio station for many years; while no longer funded by the provincial government, it still solicits most of its budget from listener and corporate donations and is permitted to air only a very small amount of commercial advertising.

[[City Saskatchewan]] originated as the Saskatchewan Communications Network, a cable-only educational and cultural public broadcaster owned by the [[government of Saskatchewan]]. SCN was sold to Bluepoint Investment Corporation in 2010, and like CTV Two Alberta did when it became privatized, incorporated a limited schedule of entertainment programming during the late afternoon and nighttime hours, while retaining educational and children's programs during the morning until mid-afternoon to fulfill its licensing conditions; Bluepoint later sold the channel to [[Rogers Media]] in 2012, expanding a relationship it began with SCN in January of that year, when Rogers began supplying entertainment programming to the channel through an affiliation agreement with its English-language broadcast network, [[City (TV network)|Citytv]].<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/saskatchewan/story/2010/06/21/sk-scn-sale-1006.html Sask.

Some local community stations also operate non-commercially with funding from corporate and individual donors. In addition, cable companies are required to produce a local [[Community channel (Canada)|community channel]] in each licensed market. Such channels have traditionally aired community talk shows, city council meetings and other locally oriented programming, although it is becoming increasingly common for them to adopt the format and branding of a local news channel.

Canada also has a large number of [[campus radio]] and [[community radio]] stations.

====Colombia====
[[Colombia]] had between 1955 and 1998 a public television system very similar to that adopted by the NPO in the Netherlands, where private television producers called "''[[programadora]]s''" were given hours on the country's two public television channels ([[Canal 1 (Colombia)|Cadena Uno]] and [[Canal A]]). In 1998, when the Colombian government allowed the opening of television to the private market by granting two broadcast licenses to the ''programadoras'' Caracol Televisión and RCN Televisión, these television producers went into crisis, causing many to end their activities or produce content for the private television channels. Currently, Colombia has three public channels (one is operated by a private company formed by the shares of four former ''programadoras'') and eight public radio stations (three stations are regional broadcasters).

====Chile====
Chilean television was founded through universities, in an attempt to bring public television without the state having to pay directly and control content. The University of Chile (owner of the former channels&nbsp;9 and 11 until 1993), the Catholic University of Chile on channels 2 and 13 until 2010, and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Valparaíso]] on channels&nbsp;8 and 4. Channel&nbsp;8, in [[Valparaíso]], is the first and oldest station on Chile, transmitting since 5 October 1957. As soon as 1961 universities began transmitting advertisements between their programmes, the first of them being the Channel&nbsp;9, showing a Motorola TV set. This kind of disguised advertising took the name of "Payola". This situation, added to the fact that TV was only reaching [[Santiago]] and [[Valparaíso]], led to the creation of a state network that should serve the entire country. This network, created in 1964 and in operation since 24 October 1969, is known as "[[Televisión Nacional de Chile]]". After the military government of [[Augusto Pinochet]], television was mostly deregulated. Thus, two new commercial channels were born: Megavisión (Channel&nbsp;9, on 23 October 1990) and La Red (Channel&nbsp;4, on 12 May 1991). The University of Chile's Channel&nbsp;11 also was rented to a private operator on 1 October 1993 and is now known today as "Chilevisión".

Televisión Nacional, popularly known as Channel 7 due to its [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] frequency, is governed by a seven-member board appointed by both the [[President of Chile|President]] and [[Chilean Senate|the Senate]]. It is meant to be independent of political pressures, although accusations of bias have been made, especially during election campaigns.

====Ecuador====
[[Ecuador TV]] is the public service channel of Ecuador, established in October 2007. The channel was established at the same time as the installation of the [[Ecuadorian Constituent Assembly]] so that the sessions could be transmitted live to all the country.

==== El Salvador ====
Salvadoran broadcasting has a public service radio and television channel. On 1 March 1926 began the operation as the first Central American broadcasting network called "Radio Nacional de El Salvador" with a frequency of 96.9 FM MHz founded by the president of that era, [[Alfonso Quiñónez Molina]]. On 4 November 1964 the Government of El Salvador founded [[Canal 10 (El Salvador)|Televisión Educativa de El Salvador]] as an educational television with the channels 8 and 10. And since 1989, Channel 10 became the only public television channel in El Salvador.

==== Mexico ====
In Mexico, public stations are operated by municipalities, state governments and universities, there are five national public channels.
[[Canal Once (Mexico)|Canal Once]] is owned, and operated by the [[Instituto Politécnico Nacional|National Politechnical Institute]]. It started transmissions on 2 March 1959 as the first public broadcasting television in Mexico.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://canalonce.mx/sobre-canal-once/|title=El Once y su historia|access-date=16 August 2019}}</ref> The [[Federal government of the United Mexican States|government of Mexico]] implemented [[Telesecundaria]] in 1968 to provide [[secondary education]] to students in rural areas through broadcast television channels, such as [[XHGC-TV]] in Mexico City. With the launching of the [[Morelos II]] satellite, Telesecundaria began transmitting on one of its analog channels in 1988; in 1994, it began broadcasting in digital format with the advent of the Solidaridad I satellite, and [[Televisión Educativa (Mexico)|Edusat]] was established and began transmitting in Mexico, [[Central America]] and certain regions of the [[United States]]. In 1982, [[XEIMT-TDT|Canal 22]] was founded and began operations eleven years later by the [[Secretariat of Culture|Ministry of Culture]] as part of the "RED México". In 2005 the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM in Spanish) began transmissions as the sister channel of [[XEUN-AM]] and [[XEUN-FM]] (both radio stations founded in 1959), [[TV UNAM]] which is part of the university and cultural diffusion. [[Canal Catorce]] was founded in 2012 and is operated by the [[Sistema Público de Radiodifusión del Estado Mexicano]] (SPR) an agency from the Federal Government.

=====History=====
Early public stations were operated by state colleges and universities, and were often run as part of the schools' [[cooperative extension service]]s. Stations in this era were internally funded, and did not rely on listener contributions to operate; some accepted advertising. Networks such as [[Iowa Public Radio]], [[South Dakota Public Broadcasting|South Dakota Public Radio]], and [[Wisconsin Public Radio]] began under this structure.<ref>{{cite web|title=The History of Public Broadcasting|url=https://onlinempa.unc.edu/history-of-public-broadcasting/|website=[[UNC-Chapel Hill Master of Public Administration]]|date=October 21, 2013|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref> The concept of a "[[non-commercial educational|non-commercial, educational]]" station ''per se'' did not show up in U.S. law until 1941, when the [[FM band]] was authorized to begin normal broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=d39b27f095e10dca36d354445fd2b649&mc=true&n=sp47.4.73.d&r=SUBPART&ty=HTML#se47.4.73_1513|title=Federal Regulations Title 47, Part 73, §73.501 Channels available for assignment.|publisher=United States Government|access-date=2016-11-22}}</ref> [[Houston]]'s [[KUHT]] was the nation's first public television station founded by Dr. John W.

The passage of the [[Public Broadcasting Act of 1967]] precipitated the development of the current public broadcasting system in the U.S. The legislation established the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] (CPB), a private entity that is charged with facilitating programming diversity among public broadcasters, the development and expansion of non-commercial broadcasting, and providing funding to local stations to help them create programs; the CPB receives funding earmarked by the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] as well as through public and private donations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Public Broadcasting Act of 1967|url=http://www.cpb.org/files/act/PublicBroadcastingAct1967.pdf|publisher=[[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]]|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=How Public Radio Scotch-Taped Its Way Into Public Broadcasting Act|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2012/11/08/164624162/how-public-radio-scotch-taped-its-way-into-public-broadcasting-act|author=Emily Hellewell|website=[[NPR]]|date=November 8, 2012|access-date=June 21, 2017}}</ref>

Public television and radio in the U.S. has, from the late 1960s onward, dealt with severe criticism from [[conservatism|conservative]] politicians and think-tanks (such as [[The Heritage Foundation]]), which allege that its programming has a [[leftist]] bias and there have been successful attempts to reduce – though not eliminate – funding for public television stations by some state legislatures.<ref>{{cite web|title=Defunding NPR?

=====Radio=====
The first public radio network in the United States was founded in 1949 in Berkeley, California, as station [[KPFA]], which became and remains the flagship station for a national network called [[Pacifica Radio]]. From the beginning, the network has refused corporate funding of any kind, and has relied mainly on listener support. KPFA gave away free FM radios to build a listener base and to encourage listeners to "subscribe" (support the station directly with donations). It is the world's oldest listener-supported radio network.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Future Active: Media Activism and the Internet|last=Meikle|first=Graham|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-415-94322-2|pages=71}}</ref> Since the creation of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, Pacifica has sometimes received CPB support. Pacifica runs other stations in [[KPFK|Los Angeles]], [[WBAI|New York City]], [[WPFW|Washington, DC.]] and [[KPFT|Houston]], as well as repeater stations and a large network of affiliates.

A national public radio network, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), was created in February 1970, following the passage of the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967. This network replaced the Ford Foundation-backed [[National Educational Radio Network]]. Some independent local public radio stations buy their programming from distributors such as NPR; [[Public Radio International]] (PRI); [[American Public Media]] (APM); [[Public Radio Exchange]] (PRX); and [[Pacifica Radio]], most often distributed through the Public Radio Satellite System.<ref>George H. Gibson, ''Public Broadcasting; The Role of the Federal Government, 1919–1976'' (Praeger Publishers, 1977).</ref> Cultural Native American and Mexican American music and programming are also featured regionally. NPR is colloquially though inaccurately conflated with ''public radio'' as a whole, when in fact "public radio" includes many organizations.

=====Television=====
In the United States, the [[PBS|Public Broadcasting Service (PBS)]] serves as the nation's main public television provider. When it launched in October 1970, PBS assumed many of the functions of its predecessor, [[National Educational Television]] (NET). NET was shut down by the [[Ford Foundation]] and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after the network refused to stop airing documentaries on varying social issues that had alienated many of the network's affiliates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Articles of Incorporation of Public Broadcasting Service| url=http://www.current.org/pbpb/documents/PBSarticles69.html|author=Public Broadcasting PolicyBase|work=[[Current (newspaper)|Current]]|date=January 14, 2000|access-date=January 12, 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010406090018/http://www.current.org/pbpb/documents/PBSarticles69.html|archive-date=April 6, 2001}}</ref> PBS would later acquire [[Educational Television Stations]], an organization founded by the [[National Association of Educational Broadcasters]] (NAEB), in 1973.<ref name="JARVIK">{{cite book|title=PBS, behind the screen|author=Laurence Ariel Jarvik|publisher=Forum|location=[[Rocklin, California]]|year=1997|isbn=0761506683}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Public TV Faces Fund Struggles|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=SelHAAAAIBAJ&pg=805,469633&dq=hartford+public+broadcasting+television+gunn&hl=en|newspaper=[[Record-Journal|The Morning Record]]|via=[[Google News]]|access-date=October 28, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Vanishing Vision: The Inside Story of Public Television|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dKYZynRiU6YC&q=hartford+n+gunn+jr&pg=PA137|author=James Day|via=[[Google Books]]|date=September 16, 1969|isbn = 9780520086593|access-date=October 23, 2013}}</ref>

In addition, the Radiodifusión Nacional de Uruguay is a network of radios with 4 different stations in AM and FM that cover the entire country.

====Venezuela====
Recently, under the initiative of the Venezuelan government of president [[Hugo Chávez]], and with the sponsorship of the governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador and Nicaragua, the news and documentary network [[teleSUR]] was created with the intention to be an instrument toward the "concretizing of the [[Bolivarianism|Bolivarian]] idea" through the integration of America, and as a counterweight to what the governments that fund it consider a "distorted view of Latin American reality by privately run networks that broadcast to the region".<ref>[http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0513/p01s03-woam.html "Latin leader rebels against US-centric news"], ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' (Retrieved on January 8, 2009)</ref> There is an ongoing debate on whether teleSUR will be able to become a neutral and fair news channel able to counter the huge influence of global media outlets, or whether it will end up as a [[propaganda]] tool of the Venezuelan government, which owns a 51 percent share of said channel.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4620411.stm | work=BBC News | first=Iain | last=Bruce | title=Venezuela sets up 'CNN rival' | date=28 June 2005}}</ref>{{update inline|date=October 2019}}

====Bangladesh====
The Bengali primary state television broadcaster is [[Bangladesh Television]] which also broadcasts worldwide through its satellite based branch, [[BTV World]]. There are also terrestrial state run TV channels: [[Sangsad TV]] owned and operated by [[Bengali parliament]] that covers the proceedings of the Parliament.
The [[Bangladesh Betar]] (BB) is the country's sole state radio broadcaster. Radio transmission in the region now forming Bangladesh started in Dhaka on December 16, 1939. The [[Ministry of Information (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Information]] is responsible for the administration of all government TV channels and Radio.

====Hong Kong====
[[File:RTHK.jpg|thumb|Broadcasting House, the longtime headquarters of RTHK]]
In Hong Kong, the Radio Television Hong Kong ([[RTHK]]) is the sole public service broadcaster. Although being a government department under the administrative hierarchy, it enjoys [[editorial independence]]. It operates seven radio channels, and produces television programmes and broadcast on commercial television channels, as these channels are required by law to provide timeslots for RTHK television programmes. RTHK would be assigned a digital terrestrial television channel during 2013 to 2015.

====India====
In India, [[Prasar Bharati]] is India's public broadcaster. It is an autonomous corporation of the [[Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India)]], Government of India and comprises the [[Doordarshan]] television network and [[All India Radio]]. Prasar Bharati was established on 23 November 1997, following a demand that the government owned broadcasters in India should be given autonomy like those in many other countries. The Parliament of India passed an Act to grant this autonomy in 1990, but it was not enacted until 15 September 1997. Though a public broadcaster, it airs commercial advertisements.

====Indonesia====
{{main|Public broadcasting in Indonesia}}
In Indonesia, there are three types of public broadcaster. The first two are national-scale broadcasters: [[Radio Republik Indonesia]] (RRI) and [[Televisi Republik Indonesia]] (TVRI). RRI currently operates four radio networks carried by some or all of more than 90 local stations, one of them is a national programming network. TVRI operates three national television channels, plus more than 30 regional stations.

There are also independent local public broadcasters which founded by local government in several cities or regencies. They are obligated to network with either RRI or TVRI, depending on the medium, though they are not owned and operated by the two.

====Japan====
In Japan, the main public broadcaster is the [[NHK]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation). The broadcaster was set up in 1926 and was modelled on the [[British Broadcasting Company]], the precursor to the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]] created in 1927. Much like the BBC, NHK is funded by a "receiving fee" from every Japanese household, with no commercial advertising and the maintenance of a position of strict political impartiality. However, rampant non-payment by a large amount of households has led the receiving fee to become something of a political issue. NHK runs two national terrestrial TV stations (NHK General and NHK Educational) and two [[satellite]] only services (NHK BS1 and NHK BS Premium services). NHK also runs 3 national radio services and a number of international radio and television services, akin to the [[BBC World Service]]. NHK has also been an innovator in television, developing the world's first [[high-definition television]] technology in 1964 and launching high definition services in Japan in 1981.

====Macau====
In [[Macau]], Teledifusão de Macau [[Teledifusão de Macau|TDM]] is the public service broadcasting company. The firm was established in January 1982 and was modelled on Rádio e Televisão de Portugal [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal|RTP]]. TDM has two independent editorial arms: the Chinese news channel and the Portuguese news channel, each of which may have different information sources, points of view, and priorities of news. TDM runs both television and radio services.

====Malaysia====
The public broadcaster in Malaysia is the state-owned [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] (RTM). RTM was previously funded publicly through money obtained from [[Television licence|television licensing]], however it is currently state-subsidised, as television licences have been abolished.

{{As of|2021}} RTM operates 6 national, 16 state and 11 district radio stations as well as 6 national terrestrial television channels: [[TV1 (Malaysian TV channel)|TV1]], [[TV2 (Malaysia)|TV2]], [[TV Okey]], [[Sukan RTM]], [[Berita RTM]] and TV6.

====Nepal====
History of public broadcasting in Nepal started from 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/Doc?docid=0AS_RFm-BmeZtZGc2ejdwbWJfNGdycmNjemdt&hl=en|title= Public Service Broadcasting in Nepal|access-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, the public broadcasters are the state-owned [[Pakistan Broadcasting Corporation]] (PBC), also known as Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television. In the past Radio Pakistan was partly funded  through money obtained from License fees. In 1999, the Nawaz Sharif government abolished license fees for Radio Pakistan and also abolished its tax exempt status protected under PBC Act 1973. The license fees for Pakistan Television continued. The license fees collection for PTV was given to WAPDA during Musharraf government. Currently WAPDA collects Rs. 35 per house hold on electricity bills as PTV license fees. Television Broadcasting started in Pakistan with a small pilot TV Station established at Lahore Radio from where transmission was first beamed in black-and-white with effect from 26 November 1964. Television centres were established in Dhaka, Karachi and Rawalpindi/Islamabad in 1967 and in Peshawar and Quetta in 1974. PTV has various channels transmitting throughout the world including PTV National, PTV World, PTV 2, PTV Global, PTV Bolan etc. Radio Pakistan has stations covering all the major cities, it covers 80% of the country serving 95.5 Million listeners. It has world service in eleven languages daily.

====Philippines====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2021}}
The Philippines' primary state television broadcaster is [[People's Television Network]] (PTV). Created in 1974 as Government Television (GTV), PTV is no longer state subsidised except for a one-time equity funding for capital outlay in 1992. Aside from PTV, the other public broadcaster is the [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] (IBC), which the government has already put up for sale. The government no longer holds a [[controlling interest]] in the former state broadcaster, [[Radio Philippines Network]] (RPN).

The [[Philippine Broadcasting Service]] (PBS) is the country's sole state radio broadcaster. Established in 1933 as KZFM by the US colonial [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Insular Government]], the radio station was passed to the Philippine government after the country [[Republic Day (Philippines)|became independent]] in 1946. Currently, PBS broadcasts its flagship network [[Radyo Pilipinas]] (formerly Radyo ng Bayan) through its 32 stations and selected affiliates nationwide.

The government is currently planning to propose the creation of a law that will merge and integrate PTV and PBS into a single entity, to be called the People's Broadcasting Corporation (PBC).

As of now, though not a government owned but most of its programmes are government related, the [[UNTV (Philippines)|UNTV]] (pronounced as "you-en-tee-vee") also dubbed as "Public Service Channel", is a television network in the Philippines which most of the programme is for public service. Owned by Atom and Larry Henares, it is the flagship television network of the [[Progressive Broadcasting Corporation]] (known on air as UNTV-PBC), together with [[Breakthrough and Milestones Productions International]] (known on air as UNTV-BMPI), the network's content provider and marketing arm and Christian religious organization [[Members Church of God International]] (MCGI). UNTV's public service programmes and free services are manned by BMPI chairman and CEO, ''Kuya'' [[Daniel Razon]] (''Kuya'' is Tagalog for Big Brother). Some of the renowned public services offered by the television network are 911-UNTV (8688) a News and Rescue concept in Metro Manila and in key cities around the Philippines which aims to save lives first in times of accident before reporting, Clinic ni Kuya (free clinic), Law Center ni Kuya (free legal counseling), Libreng Sakay (free one-ride bus ride), everyday medical mission in different sitios and barangay, etc.

====Singapore====
[[Mediacorp]] is the only public broadcaster in Singapore.

====South Korea====
South Korea's representative public broadcasting television network is meant to be [[Korean Broadcasting System]], or KBS. Originally a government-controlled channel, it is now an independent broadcasting system. KBS began broadcasting radio in 1947 and opened up to television industry in 1961, and officially founded its own identity by 1973. Another public broadcasting channel is the [[Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation]], or MBC. Known to be the second channel of the country, it also shares the roles of being national television with the KBS.

South Korea also has another public broadcasting channel called [[Educational Broadcasting System]], or EBS. Originally considered to be an extension channel of the KBS, it was spun-off as an educational channel but retained its public broadcasting tasks. KBS and EBS mainly are funded by the commercials that they provide in their channels, but due to growing competitions, this is becoming an issue for them as well.

====Taiwan====
[[Public Television Service]], also called Taiwan Public Television Service Foundation, is the first independent public broadcasting institution in Taiwan, which broadcasts the Public Television Service Taiwan. Since its creation in 1998, PTS has produced several critically acclaimed dramatic programmes and mini-series despite experiencing funding difficulties.

[[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] itself, however, is a commercial government-owned television funded by subscriptions and advertising, with particular public service duties such as allowing regional stations to air their newscasts within specific timeslots of the main TV 2 channel.

====Faroe Islands====
[[Kringvarp Føroya]] is the organisation in Faroe Islands with public service obligations. Formed in 1957 as a radio broadcaster [[Útvarp Føroya]]. Merged with Sjónvarp Føroya TV station on 1 January 2007 to form [[Kringvarp Føroya]]. Funded by licence fees.

====Estonia====

====Finland====
[[Yle|Yle - The Finnish Broadcasting Company]], (pronounced /yle/) or Yleisradio (in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) and Rundradion (in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) is [[Finland|Finland's]] national public service media company. Founded in 1926, it is a public limited company majority owned by the Finnish state, employing around 2,800 people. Yle is funded by a special Yle tax. Yle has four television channels, three television channel slots, six nationwide radio channels and three radio services.<ref>{{Cite web|title=This is Yle|url=https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/about-yle/this-is-yle}}</ref>

[[Yle TV1]] is the most viewed TV channel in Finland and [[Yle Radio Suomi]] the most popular radio channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/aihe/node/285920/|title=Yle's year 2018: The most used contents of the year}}</ref> Yle was the first of the Nordic public broadcasters to implement the Eurovision's portability regulation on its online media service [https://areena.yle.fi/tv Yle Areena].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yle.fi/aihe/artikkeli/2019/01/02/is-your-permanent-place-of-residence-in-finland-you-can-now-take-all-video|title=Press release: Is your permanent place of residence in Finland?

====France====
In 1949 [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|Radiodiffusion-télévision française]] (RTF – French television and radio broadcasting) was created to take over from the earlier [[Radiodiffusion française]] responsibility for the operation of the country's three public radio networks and the introduction of a public television service. A fourth radio network was added in 1954 and a second television channel in 1963.

RTF was transformed into the [[Office de radiodiffusion télévision française]] (ORTF), a more independent structure, in 1964. ORTF oversaw the introduction of a third television channel in 1972, two years before the dissolution of the structure in 1974. Between this date and 2000, each channel had its own direction structure. The first channel ([[TF1]]) was sold to the private sector in 1987. (At the time, the channel with the largest audience was the other public channel [[Antenne 2]]).

In 1986 a French/German public channel was created, [[Arte|ARTE]], originally broadcast on cable and satellite. Later, the fall of the private channel [[La Cinq]] freed some frequencies that it had used each day after 19.00. In 1994 a new public channel, [[France5|La cinquième]] was created to use the remaining time on the same frequencies. La cinquième and ARTE subsequently shared the same channels with the exception of satellite, cable, and internet channels where both could be broadcast all day long. In 2000 all the public channels were united into one structure, [[France Télévisions]].

====Germany====
{{See also|Beitragsservice von ARD, ZDF und Deutschlandradio}}

After [[World War II]], when regional broadcasters had been merged into one national network by the [[Nazis]] to create a powerful means of [[propaganda]], [[Allies of World War II|the Allies]] insisted on a de-centralised, independent structure for German public broadcasting and created regional public broadcasting agencies that, by and large, still exist today.
[[File:ARD Karte.svg|thumb|Map of ARD-members]]

* [[Norddeutscher Rundfunk|NDR]] ([[Lower Saxony]], [[Hamburg]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]] and [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]), split from former NWDR
* [[Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg|RBB]] ([[Berlin]] and [[Brandenburg]]), merged from SFB and ORB
* [[Südwestrundfunk|SWR]] ([[Baden-Württemberg]] and  [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]), merged from SDR and SWF
* [[Mitteldeutscher Rundfunk|MDR]] ([[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and [[Thuringia]]), established in 1991
* [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] ([[North Rhine-Westphalia]]), split from former NWDR

* [[Hessischer Rundfunk|hr]] ([[Hesse]])
* [[Saarländischer Rundfunk|SR]] ([[Saarland]])
* [[Radio Bremen|RB]] ([[Bremen (state)|Bremen]])

In addition to these nine regional radio and TV broadcasters, which cooperate within [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], a second national television service—actually called Second German Television ({{lang-de|[[Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen]]}}, ZDF)—was later created in 1961 and a national radio service with two networks ([[Deutschlandradio]]) emerged from the remains of [[Cold War]] propaganda stations in 1994. All services are mainly financed through licence fees paid by every household and are governed by councils of representatives of the "[[society|societally]] relevant groups". Public TV and radio stations spend about 60% of the ≈10bn&nbsp;€ spent altogether for broadcasting in Germany per year, making it the most well funded public broadcasting system in the world.

The ''Hans-Bredow-Institut'', or Hans-Bredow-Institute for Media Research at the University of Hamburg (HBI) is an independent non-profit foundation with the mission on media research on public communication, particularly for radio and television [[broadcasting]] (including public service media providers) and other electronic media, in an interdisciplinary fashion.<ref name="Khabyuk2011">{{Cite book

====Hungary====

{{Main|MTVA (Hungary)}}

[[Magyar Televízió]] (MTV) and [[Magyar Rádió]] (MR, also known internationally as Radio Budapest)   is a nationwide public  broadcasting organization in [[Hungary]]. Headquartered in [[Budapest]], it is the oldest broadcaster in Hungary and airs four TV channels ([[M1 (TV channel)|M1 HD]], [[M2 (TV channel)|M2 HD]], M4 Sport and M5), and six Radio networks ([[Kossuth Rádió]], Petőfi Rádió, Bartók Rádió, Dankó Rádió, Nemzetiségi Adások and 
Parlamenti adások) as well.

In May 2019, M3 ceases broadcasting as it was replaced by an online TV channel, ''m3.hu'' (Link: https://www.m3.hu), much like BBC Three in the UK which ceased broadcasting five years earlier than M3, but pretty much the same way.

Both MTV And MR is managed and primarily funded by the [[MTVA (Hungary)|Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund]] ({{lang-hu|Médiaszolgáltatás-támogató és Vagyonkezelő Alap}}, abbreviated MTVA).<ref name=ceu.hu>{{cite web|title=Media Law in Hungary|url=http://medialaws.ceu.hu/public_service_media_more.html|publisher=Center for Media and Communication Studies (CMCS)|access-date=23 August 2015}}</ref> This [[government agency|government organization]], formed in 2011, also manages the public service broadcasters  [[Duna TV|Duna Televízió]] as well as the Hungarian [[news agency]] [[Magyar Távirati Iroda]].<ref name=mtva.hu>{{cite web|title=MTVA - Médiaszolgáltatás-támogató és Vagyonkezelő Alap portálja - ENGLISH|url=http://mtva.hu/en/english|publisher=Media Service Support and Asset Management Fund (MTVA)|access-date=29 May 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529103918/http://mtva.hu/en/english|archive-date=29 May 2014}}</ref>

====Iceland====
[[RÚV|Ríkisútvarpið (RÚV)]] ("The Icelandic National Broadcasting Service") is [[Iceland]]'s national public-service broadcasting organisation. RÚV began radio broadcasting in 1930 and its first television transmissions were made in 1966. In both cases coverage quickly reached nearly every household in Iceland. RÚV is funded by a [[television licence]] fee collected from every income taxpayer, as well as advertising revenue. RÚV has been a full active member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] since 1956.

RÚV—which by the terms of its charter is obliged to "promote the Icelandic language, Icelandic history, and Iceland's cultural heritage" and "honour basic democratic rules, [[human rights]], and the freedom of speech and opinion"<ref>[http://www.ruv.is/heim/english/english/ RÚV's official website (English-language version)] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20060522223149/www.ruv.is/heim/english/english/ |date=2006-05-22 }}</ref>—carries a substantial amount of arts, media, and current affairs programming, in addition to which it also supplies general entertainment in the form of feature films and such internationally popular television drama series as ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. RÚV's lineup also includes sports coverage, documentaries, domestically produced entertainment shows, and children's programming.

====Ireland====
In Ireland there are two state owned public service broadcasters, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] and [[TG4]]. [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] was established in 1960 with the merger of ''Raidió Éireann'' (1926) and ''Teilifís Éireann'' (1960). TG4 was formed as a subsidiary of ''RTÉ'' in 1996 as ''Teilifís na Gaeilge (TnaG)'', it was renamed ''TG4'' in 1999, and was made independent of ''RTÉ'' in 2007.

Both Irish public service broadcasters receive part of the licence fee, with RTÉ taking the lion's share of the funding. Advertising makes up 50% of RTÉ's income and just 6% of TG4's income. 7% of the licence fee is provided to the ''[[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]]'' since 2006.  Up to 2006 the licence fee was given entirely to ''RTÉ''.

RTÉ offers a range of free to air services on television; [[RTÉ 1]], [[RTÉ 2]], [[RTÉjr]], and [[RTÉ News Now]]. On radio; [[RTÉ Radio 1]], [[RTÉ 2FM]], [[RTÉ Lyric FM]], and [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]], as well as a number of channels on [[Digital Audio Broadcasting|DAB]].

The Sound and Vision Fund is operated by the [[Broadcasting Authority of Ireland]], this fund receives 7% of the licence fee. The fund is used to assist broadcasters to commission public service broadcast programming. It is open to all independent producers provided they the backing of a free-to-air or community broadcaster, such as [[TV3 (Ireland)|Virgin Media]], [[Today FM]], [[BBC]] Northern Ireland, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]], [[Channel 4]], [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]], etc. Pay TV broadcaster [[Setanta Sports]] have also received funding for programming through the Fund provided they make that programming available on a [[free-to-view]] basis.

[[TG4]] is an independent [[Irish language]] public service broadcaster that is funded by government subsidy, part of the licence fee, and through advertising revenue.

[[TV3 (Ireland)|Virgin Media]] is the only independent broadcaster that has public service commitments.{{Citation needed|date= August 2020}}

====Italy====
[[File:Rai - Logo 2016.svg|thumb|upright=0.5|RAI brand]]
The Italian national broadcasting company is [[RAI]] – Radiotelevisione Italiana, founded as URI in 1924. RAI transmits thirteen channels: [[Rai 1]], [[Rai 2]], [[Rai 3]], [[Rai 4]], [[Rai 5]], [[Rai News24|Rai News 24]], [[Rai Premium]], [[Rai Movie]], [[Rai Sport]], [[Rai Storia]], [[Rai Gulp]], [[Rai YoYo|Rai Yoyo]], [[Rai Scuola]] (all available also in high definition). RAI also broadcasts via satellite and is involved in radio, publishing and cinema. RAI has the largest audience share (45%) of any Italian television network. Proceeds derive from a periodical standing charge (90 euros for each household in 2017<ref>{{in lang|it}}[http://www.pmi.it/impresa/contabilita-e-fisco/news/134877/canone-rai-90-euro-dal-2017.html Canone RAI a 90 euro dal 2017], PMI.it</ref>) and from advertising. The main competitors of RAI are [[Mediaset]], the biggest national private broadcaster, divided in twelve channels (two of which are both SD and HD), [[La7]] and La7d, owned by Cairo Editore; other competitors are Sky Italia (with three FTA channels) and Discovery Italia (with seven FTA channels).

====Lithuania====
[[Lithuanian National Radio and Television]] (LRT) is the national broadcaster of Lithuania. It was founded in 1926 as radio broadcaster, and opened a television broadcasting subdivision in 1957. LRT broadcasts three radio stations ([[LRT Radijas]], [[LRT Klasika]] and LRT Opus), and three TV channels ([[LRT televizija]], [[LRT Kultūra]] and [[LRT Lituanica]]).

====Malta====
[[Public Broadcasting Services]] (PBS) is the national broadcaster of Malta. It operates three television services ([[Television Malta|TVM]], [[TVM2]], and [[Parliament TV (Malta)|Parliament TV]]) and three radio services ([[Radio Malta|Radju Malta]], [[Radju Malta 2]], and [[Magic Malta]]).

====Moldova====
[[Teleradio-Moldova]] (TRM) is the public funded radio-TV broadcaster in Moldova. It owns the TV channels [[Moldova 1]] and [[TV Moldova Internaţional|TVMI]], and the radio channels [[Radio Moldova]] and [[Radio Moldova Internaţional]].

====Montenegro====
[[RTCG]] (Radio Television of Montenegro) is the public broadcaster in Montenegro.

====Netherlands====
{{Main|Dutch public broadcasting system}}
The Netherlands uses a rather unusual system of public broadcasting. Public-broadcasting associations are allocated money and time to broadcast their programmes on the publicly owned television and radio channels, collectively known under the [[Nederlandse Publieke Omroep|NPO]] name. The time and money is allocated in proportion to their membership numbers. The system is intended to reflect the diversity of all the groups composing the nation.

====Nordic countries====
National public broadcasters in The Nordic countries were modeled after the BBC and established a decade later: Radioordningen (now [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]]) in Denmark, Kringkastingselskapet (now [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation|NRK]]) in Norway, and Radiotjänst (now [[Sveriges Radio]] and [[Sveriges Television]]) in Sweden (all in 1925). In 1926 Yleisradio (Swedish: Rundradion) now [[Yle]] was founded in Finland. All four are funded from television licence fees costing (in 2007) around {{€|230}} ({{USD|300}}) per household per year.<!--Add Iceland here? Faroe Islands?-->

====Poland====
Public broadcasters include [[Telewizja Polska]] (TVP) television and [[Polskie Radio]], however TVP in recent years has been considered to be [[state media]] by various press freedom organisations due its strong bias in favour of the ruling party, with [[Reporters Without Borders]] calling it a government mouthpiece. TVP operates three main channels: [[TVP 1]], [[TVP 2]] and [[TVP 3]]. It also broadcasts several digital channels (including TVP&nbsp;1, TVP1 HD, TVP 2, TVP2 HD, [[TVP Info]], [[TVP Kultura]], [[TVP Historia]], [[TVP HD]], [[TVP Polonia]], [[TVP Sport]], [[TVP Seriale]]) via satellite and digital terrestrial television system, and 16 regional affiliates (known as TVP Regionalna, regional channels cooperate when creating most of materials). TVP also runs services with news, a video streaming (video on demand) service as well as live streaming of all its channels. [[Polskie Radio]] operates four nationwide radio channels (which are also available via the broadcaster's website). There are also 17 state-owned radio stations broadcasting in particular regions. TVP and Polish Radio are funded from several sources: state funding, advertising, obligatory tax on all TV and radio receivers, and money from authors/copyright associations. The public broadcasters offer a mix of commercial shows and programmes they are, by law, required to broadcast (i.e., [[non-commercial]], niche programmes; programmes for children; programmes promoting different points of view and diversity; programmes for different religious and national groups; live coverage of the parliament's session on its dedicated channel: TVP Parlament; etc.). It has to be politically neutral, although in the past there have been cases of political pressure on TVP and Polskie Radio from the governing party. Recently, a new law has been passed by the ruling Law & Justice party, that in public perception allowed the party to take a much larger control over the media that has been possible before. The party states this law to be the first step to a complete public media overdo. Many worry no such improvements are actually coming and that these recent laws are only another step in taking control over the whole country by the Law & Justice party.

There is an ongoing debate in Poland about the semi-commercial nature of TVP and PR. Many people fear that making them into totally non-commercial broadcasters would result in the licence fee payable by households being increased, and fewer people being interested in programmes they offer; others say that TVP in particular is too profit-driven and should concentrate on programming that benefits the society.

====Portugal====
{{Main|Rádio e Televisão de Portugal}}
[[File:Rádio e Televisão de Portugal.svg|thumb|RTP brand]]
In Portugal, the national public broadcaster is [[Rádio e Televisão de Portugal]] (RTP), which in 1957 began regular broadcasts of its first channel, now [[RTP1]]. In 1968 its second channel appeared, then called "''segundo programa''", now [[RTP2]]. In the 1970s, TV arrived in the Portuguese islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]], with the creation of two regional channels: [[RTP Madeira]] in 1972 and [[RTP Açores]] in 1976.

Until the 1990s the state had a monopoly on TV broadcasting, so RTP1 and RTP2 were the only Portuguese channels, both with similar [[generalist channel|generalist programmes]]. In 1990, RTP1 was renamed "Canal&nbsp;1", and in 1992 RTP2 was renamed "TV2". With the creation of the two private channels, [[Sociedade Independente de Comunicação|SIC]] in 1992 and [[Televisão Independente]] in 1993, the philosophy of the public service changed: in 1995, ''TV2'' was again renamed RTP2 and became an alternative channel dedicated to culture, science, arts, documentaries, sports (except football), minorities and children. Since then, RTP2 has carried no advertising. Canal&nbsp;1, renamed back RTP1 also in 1995, remained the commercial channel of RTP group, focused on entertainment, information and major sport competitions. In 2004, after a great restructuring period, RTP started its current branding. That year the two thematic channels of the group were also created—RTPN, a 24 hour-news channel which became RTP Informação in 2011 and [[RTP3]] in 2015; and [[RTP Memória]], dedicated to classic RTP programming. In 2014 the headquarters of RTP2 were transferred from [[Lisbon]] to [[Porto]].

The group also has two international channels: [[RTP Internacional]], founded in 1992 and dedicated to Eurovision, Asia and Americas, and [[RTP África]], founded in 1998 focused on Africa, mainly the [[CPLP]] countries of [[Angola]], [[Cape Verde]], [[Guinea-Bissau]], [[Mozambique]] and [[São Tomé and Príncipe]].

The RTP group is financed by the advertising revenues from RTP1, RTP Informação, RTP Memória, RTP África, and RTP Internacional, and also by the ''taxa de contribuição audiovisual'' (broadcasting contribution tax), which is incorporated in electricity bills. Funding from the government budget ceased in 2014, during the [[2010–14 Portuguese financial crisis|Portuguese financial crisis]].

====Romania====
[[Romanian Television]] (TVR) is the national public TV broadcaster in Romania. It operates five channels: [[TVR1]], [[TVR2]], [[TVR3]], [[TVRi]], and [[TVR HD]], along with six regional studios in [[TVR București|Bucharest]], [[TVR Cluj|Cluj-Napoca]], [[TVR Iași|Iași]], [[TVR Timișoara|Timișoara]], [[TVR Craiova|Craiova]], and [[TVR Târgu Mureș|Târgu Mureș]].

The public radio broadcaster is [[Romanian Radio Broadcasting Company]] (Radio Romania). It operates [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and [[AM broadcasting|AM]], and [[webcast|internet]] national, regional, and local radio channels. The regional and local stations are branded as [[Radio România Regional]]. Broadcasting in 12 languages, [[Radio Romania International]] is the company's international radio station.

TVR and Radio Romania are funded through a hybrid financing system, drawing from the state budget, a special tax (incorporated in electricity bills), and advertising too.

====Serbia====
[[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) is the national public broadcaster in [[Serbia]]. It operates a total of five television channels (RTS1, RTS2, RTS Digital, RTS HD and RTS SAT) and five radio stations (Radio Belgrade&nbsp;1, Radio Belgrade&nbsp;2, Radio Belgrade&nbsp;3, Radio Belgrade 202, and Stereorama). RTS is primarily funded through public television licence fees bundled with electricity bills paid monthly, as well as [[advertising]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=06&dd=25&nav_id=80948|title=Consumer protection group wants TV fees abolished|work=B92|access-date=October 13, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019083435/http://www.b92.net/eng/news/society-article.php?yyyy=2012&mm=06&dd=25&nav_id=80948|archive-date=October 19, 2013}}</ref>

====Slovakia====

[[Radio and Television Slovakia]] (RTVS) is the national public broadcaster in [[Slovakia]], with headquarters in [[Bratislava]]. This organisation was created in 2011 by merger of Slovak Television and Slovak Radio. RTVS broadcasts two television channels (STV1, STV2), five FM radio stations (Rádio Slovensko, Rádio Devín, Rádio Regina, Rádio_FM and Rádio Patria), one satellite radio channel ([[Radio Slovakia International]]) and three digital only radio stations (Rádio Klasika, Rádio Litera and Rádio Junior). RTVS is funded through monthly fee of €4.64, which every household with electricity connection must pay. The director of RTVS is Václav Mika. RTVS is a full member of [[European broadcasting union]].

====Spain====
In Spain, being a highly decentralised country, two public broadcasting systems coexist: a national broadcasting television, [[RTVE|Radio y Televisión Española]] (RTVE), that can be watched all around Spain, and many autonomic TV channels, which only broadcast within their respective [[Autonomous Community]]. Televisión Española was founded in 1956, during Franco's dictatorship. It broadcasts two different TV-channels: [[TVE1]] (a.k.a. ''La Primera'' or ''La uno''), that is a wide-range audience general channel; and [[TVE2]], (a.k.a. ''La dos''), that tends to offer cultural programing, as well as sport competitions. For most of its history, RTVE was funded both from public sources and private advertising; however, from September 2009, RTVE's channels have been funded by a mixture of public tax revenue and funds collected from Spain's private TV stations, thus removing advertising from the broadcaster. A TV licence fee has been suggested, but with little popular success.

Moreover, most [[autonomous communities]] of Spain have their own public broadcaster, and almost all of these are members of [[FORTA]], usually consisting of either one or two public channels that tend to reproduce the model set up by Televisión Española: a general channel and one that focuses on cultural programming. In the Autonomous Communities that have their own official language besides (Castilian) Spanish, those channels may broadcast not in Spanish, but in the other co-official language. For example, this occurs in [[Catalonia]], where [[Televisió de Catalunya]] broadcasts mainly in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. In the [[Valencian Community]], [[CVMC]] broadcasts a TV channel and a radio network, both branded as À Punt<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apuntmedia.es|title=À Punt Mèdia|website=À Punt Mèdia, the public valencian media}}</ref> and mainly broadcast on [[Valencian language|Valencian]]. In the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], [[Euskal Telebista]] (ETB) has three channels, two of which broadcast only in [[Basque language|basque]] ([[ETB 1]] and [[ETB 3]]), whereas the other ([[ETB 2]]) broadcasts in Spanish. In [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Television de Galicia]] and the [[Television de Galicia|G2]]. All the autonomous community networks are funded by a mixture of public subsidies and private advertising.

====Sweden====
[[File:SVT 2016.svg|upright|thumb|The logo of SVT]]
[[File:Sveriges-Radio-Logo.svg|thumb|The logo of Sveriges Radio]]
Sweden has three public service broadcasters, namely [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT), [[Sveriges Utbildningsradio]] (UR), and [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR), having previously had government monopoly. SVT is the national public television broadcaster with 4 channels (SVT 1, SVT 2, SVT Barnkanalen, and SVT 24). The aim is to make programmes for everybody. For example, Sweden has the historic [[Sami people|Sami]] minority and SVT make programmes in their language for them to watch. There are also a Finnish minority in Sweden, thus SVT show news in Finnish on [[SVT Uutiset]]. SR is the radio equivalent of SVT, with channels P1, P2, P3, P4, P5, and the Finnish channel SR Sisuradio.

====United Kingdom====
{{main|Public service broadcasting in the United Kingdom}}
The United Kingdom has a strong tradition of public service broadcasting. In addition to the [[BBC]], established in 1922, there is also [[Channel 4]], a publicly owned, commercially funded public service broadcaster, and [[S4C]], a Welsh-language broadcaster in Wales. Furthermore, the two commercial broadcasters [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] also have significant public service obligations imposed as part of their licence to broadcast.

In the UK there are also small community broadcasters. There are now 228 stations with FM broadcast licences (licensed by [[Ofcom]]). Community radio stations typically cover a small geographical area with a coverage radius of up to 5&nbsp;km and run on a nonprofit basis. They can cater for whole communities or for different areas of interest—such as a particular ethnic group, age group or interest group. Community radio stations reflect a diverse mix of cultures and interests. For example, you can listen to stations catering to urban or experimental music, while others are aimed at younger people, religious communities or the armed forces and their families.

===Oceania===

====Australia====
In Australia, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC) is owned by the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]] and is 100% taxpayer funded. The multicultural [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS), another public broadcaster, now accepts limited sponsorship and advertising.

In addition, there is a large Australian [[community radio]] sector, funded in part by federal grants via the Community Broadcasting Foundation, but largely sustained via subscriptions, donations and business sponsorship. As of February 2020, there are 450+ fully licensed community radio stations <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbaa.org.au/about/about-community-broadcasting|title = About Community Broadcasting|date = 14 November 2014}}</ref> and a number of [[community television]] stations (most operating as [[Channel 31 (Australia)|Channel 31]] despite being unrelated across different states). They are organised similarly to PBS and NPR stations in the United States, and take on the role that [[public access television]] stations have in the US.

====New Zealand====
{{main|Public broadcasting in New Zealand}}
In New Zealand all broadcasters are given a small slice of public broadcasting responsibility, because of the state-funded agency [[NZ On Air]]. This is because of NZ On Air's requirement for public-service programmes across all channels and stations, instead of being put into one single network. The former public broadcaster BCNZ (formerly NZBC – [[New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation]]) was broken up into separate state-owned corporations, [[Television New Zealand]] (TVNZ) and [[Radio New Zealand]] (RNZ). While RNZ remains commercial-free, about 90% of funding for TVNZ comes from selling advertising during programmes on their two stations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/823782|title=The TVNZ Charter|access-date=2011-02-20}}</ref><ref name="Te Ara">{{cite web |last1=McMillan |first1=Kate |title=Media and politics - Ownership and Regulation |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/media-and-politics/page-2 |publisher=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand |access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref> TVNZ continues to be a public broadcaster; however like [[CBC Television]] in Canada it is essentially a fully commercial network in continuous ratings battles with other stations, which continues to be a [[TVNZ#Controversies|controversial issue]] within New Zealand. With the shutdown of TVNZ&nbsp;7, the only fully non-commercial public-service network in New Zealand is [[Radio New Zealand]].

Aside from television, New Zealand has a rich public radio culture, [[Radio New Zealand]] being the main provider, with a varied network ([[Radio New Zealand National]]) and a classical musical network ([[Radio New Zealand Concert]]). RNZ also provides the Pacific with its [[Radio New Zealand International]]. Aside from RNZ almost all of [[Regions of New Zealand|New Zealand's 16 regions]] has an "[[Association of Community Access Broadcasters|access radio]]" network. All these networks are commercial-free.<ref name="Te Ara" />

In late January 2020, the [[Sixth Labour Government of New Zealand|Labour-led coalition government]] announced that they were planning to merge TVNZ and Radio New Zealand to create a new public broadcasting service.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Patterson |first1=Jane |title=New details revealed as Cabinet agrees on RNZ, TVNZ public broadcasting decision |url=https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/408355/new-details-revealed-as-cabinet-agrees-on-rnz-tvnz-public-broadcasting-decision |access-date=30 January 2020 |work=[[Radio New Zealand]] |date=29 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=PM: Potential RNZ-TVNZ merger would not harm commercial broadcasters |url=https://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/on-air/the-country/audio/jacinda-ardern-new-zealand-needs-a-public-broadcaster-to-tell-local-stories/ |access-date=30 January 2020 |work=[[Newstalk ZB]] |date=29 January 2020}}</ref> In response, the opposition [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] announced that it would oppose any plans to merge Radio NZ and TVNZ.<ref>{{cite news |title=National threatens to drop RNZ-TVNZ merger if elected |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&objectid=12304374 |access-date=30 January 2020 |work=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=29 January 2020}}</ref>
