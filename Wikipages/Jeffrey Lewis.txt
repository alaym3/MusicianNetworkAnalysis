'''Jeffrey Lewis''' (born November 20, 1975) is an American singer-songwriter and comic book artist.<ref>{{cite news|author=Andrew Purcell |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/apr/13/jeffrey-lewis-em-are-i |title=Andrew Purcell interviews Jeffrey Lewis &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

==Early life==
Lewis was born in New York City and grew up on the [[Lower East Side]].<ref name="Robert Christgau- NPR">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/10/31/141879899/jeffrey-lewis-cosmic-and-tongue-in-cheek-dream-songs |title=Jeffrey Lewis: Cosmic And Tongue-In-Cheek 'Dream-Songs' |publisher=NPR |date=October 3, 2011|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsminer.com/features/latitude_65/comic-artist-musician-jeffrey-lewis-blends-genres-with-quirky-anti/article_522def4e-3c7c-544f-9e7a-ebf0e852c0fb.html |title=Comic artist, musician Jeffrey Lewis blends genres with quirky 'anti-folk' style &#124; Latitude 65 |website=Newsminer.com |date=June 2, 2012|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref> He attended [[State University of New York at Purchase]], graduating in 1997 with a degree in Literature. His Senior Literary Thesis was on the comic book ''[[Watchmen]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Jeffries |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jeffrey-lewis-mn0000263995/biography |title=Jeffrey Lewis &#124; Biography & History |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=November 2, 1975|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

Lewis also lectured on the topic of ''Watchmen'' at the Institute For Cultural Studies at the University of Leuven, Belgium, in 2000, and the text of his lecture ("The Dual Nature of Apocalypse in Watchmen") was published in the book ''The Graphic Novel'', edited by Jan Baetens, in 2001.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Baetens, Jan|title=The Graphic Novel|publisher=[[Leuven University Press]]|date=2001|isbn=90-5867-109-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KEWX-9jdNzoC&q=%22The+Graphic+Novel%22+Baetens&pg=PA5|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

Starting in 2000, he spent about two years living in [[Austin, Texas]], playing [[open mic]] nights, working odd jobs and distributing his autobiographical comics to local coffee shops.

==Music==
Several of his musical influences have been acknowledged in his songs such as "Williamsburg [[Will Oldham]] Horror", "The History of [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]" and "The [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] Oral Sex Song", concerning the song by [[Leonard Cohen]]. Lewis' lyrics are complex and literate, often combining a nihilistic world-view with a hopeful message and sharp wit. Growing up on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], his songs are also highly informed by his home surroundings, with songs name-dropping places such as [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], the [[FDR Drive]] and the [[East River]].

Lewis is often regarded as part of the [[antifolk]] movement,<ref>{{cite news|author=Caroline Sullivan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/20/jeffrey-lewis-peter-stampfel-review |title=Jeffrey Lewis – review &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref> foremost because he was one of the many bands and performers (including [[The Moldy Peaches]], [[Kimya Dawson]], [[Diane Cluck]], [[Regina Spektor]], [[Major Matt Mason USA]] and [[Lach (musician)|Lach]]) who played in the 1990s at New York's [[SideWalk Cafe]] and its biannual antifolk festivals and [[open mic]] events. His music also possesses certain traits of a perceived antifolk style – a downbeat self-deprecating humor, an off-kilter singing style, a mixture of acoustic and 'punk' songs which feature themes of everyday occurrences and feelings. Lewis himself does not mind the 'antifolk' tag: "I think it's a cool title. The fact that no one knows what it means, including me, makes it kind of mysterious and more interesting than saying that you're a singer/songwriter or that you play indie rock."<ref name="BBC Collective with Jeff Lewis">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/collective/A6999853 |title=BBC Collective with Jeff Lewis|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

After being signed by the British record label [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]] in 2001, Jeffrey Lewis released his first official album ''[[The Last Time I Did Acid I Went Insane]]''. Also that year (in February), Lewis was visited by [[Kimya Dawson]] while living in [[Austin, Texas]]. Over the week she stayed there, they wrote five songs. These songs were later re-recorded with a full band and released by K Records under the moniker "[[The Bundles]]," on an album of the same name, in 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/artist/f144b9e2-e63e-4f3f-9136-1c336cfa5da0 |title=Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=January 1, 1970 |access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

In 2003 Rough Trade released the album ''[[It's the Ones Who've Cracked That the Light Shines Through]],'' credited to Jeffrey Lewis with Jack Lewis and drummer [[Anders Griffen]].  His third Rough Trade record, ''[[City and Eastern Songs]]'', was released in the UK in November 2005 and in the US in September 2006.  Most of Lewis's albums also include his brother, [[Jack Lewis (musician)|Jack Lewis]], who wrote or co-wrote and sang and played bass on a number of the songs. In October 2007, Rough Trade released ''[[12 Crass Songs]]'', a Jeffrey Lewis album consisting entirely of songs written by the British punk band [[Crass]], reworked to match Lewis's antifolk style.

He has also performed and collaborated with [[Kimya Dawson]] of [[The Moldy Peaches]] as well as [[Diane Cluck]]. Some of his hand-drawn comics appear in the cover art of his CD releases.

In June 2008 Jeffrey Lewis with his brother Jack were the support act for [[Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks]] in Europe.  Other well-known acts that Lewis has performed shows or whole tours with include [[Devendra Banhart]], [[Jarvis Cocker]], [[Black Dice]], [[Adam Green (musician)|Adam Green]], [[Thurston Moore]], [[the Fall (band)|the Fall]], [[Kimya Dawson]], [[Beth Orton]], [[Frank Black]], [[the Fiery Furnaces]], [[Daniel Johnston]], [[Scout Niblett]], [[the Mountain Goats]], [[Dr. Dog]], [[The Moldy Peaches]], [[Cornershop (band)|Cornershop]], [[Trachtenburg Family Slideshow Players]], [[Wooden Wand]], [[the Cribs]], [[Danielson]], [[Herman Dune]], [[Los Campesinos]], [[Roky Erickson]], and [[Super Furry Animals]].

''[[The New York Times]]'' has published his writings and graphic works.<ref name="nytimes1">{{cite news|author=Lewis, Jeffrey|title=A Song of Woe, Gone Viral (Bonus Comic Strip) @ The Opinionator|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=February 13, 2012|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/a-song-of-woe-gone-viral-bonus-comic-strip/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

''The New York Times'' online Op-Ed page "Measure For Measure" hired Jeffrey Lewis to write a number of short essays on the topic of songwriting, some of which he drew in comic book form.  All went up on ''The New York Times'' website at intervals from 2008 to 2013.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/12/11/strictly-personal/|title=Strictly Personal @ The Opinionator|author=Jeffrey Lewis|date=December 11, 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref><ref name="nytimes1"/>

Lewis has created a number of illustrated historical songs, usually sung while flipping through accompanying books of color drawings, including ten such pieces which are in use by [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]] on their website.<ref name="http://www.history.com/videos/the-french-revolution">{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/videos/the-french-revolution|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123190922/http://www.history.com/videos/the-french-revolution|url-status=dead|archive-date=January 23, 2013|title=The French Revolution (2:49) TV-PG: Step into {{sic|the|hide=y|reason=double 'the' error in source}} the excitement and chaos of the French Revolution as told by musician and artist Jeffrey Lewis.|access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref>

Lewis published a comic strip in ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in London. It was entitled "What Would Pussy Riot Do?" and it was printed on the occasion of a new release of a single with the same title.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jeffrey Lewis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/interactive/2013/sep/19/what-would-pussy-riot-do-jeffrey-lewis-comic-strip |title=What would Pussy Riot do? – a Jeffrey Lewis comic strip &#124; Music |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 1, 2013|access-date=December 3, 2015}}</ref>

In a January 2018 "MusicMakers" interview with [[Adafruit Industries|Adafruit]], Lewis announced he was working on numerous new projects, including "Writing a new issue of my comic book series, mastering an album I recorded of covers of [[Tuli Kupferberg]] songs, mixing an album I recorded in collaboration with [[Peter Stampfel]], and working on writing and recording new songs with my band for my own next album. Remastering and repackaging my old 2005 album “City & Eastern Songs" for a deluxe vinyl re-issue."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.adafruit.com/2018/01/01/musicmakers003-jeffrey-lewis-musicmonday-musicmakers/|title=MusicMakers003: Jeffrey Lewis|date=January 1, 2018|website=Blog.adafruit.com|access-date=June 23, 2018}}</ref>
