'''Yunalis binti Mat Zara'ai''' ([[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]]: يوناليس بنت مد ظراعي; born 14 November 1986<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yuna-zarai-mn0002609955  |title=Yuna Zarai |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=4 August 2018}}</ref>), known professionally as '''Yuna''', is a Malaysian singer-songwriter. Her initial exposure came through the viral success of her music uploaded to [[Myspace]], which received over one million plays. This online success alerted an [[indie-pop]] label/management company to her music, and in early 2011 she signed with the [[Fader Label]]. She is best known for her collaboration with [[Usher (singer)|Usher]] on her breakout single "[[Crush (Yuna song)|Crush]]", which peaked at number 3 on the US [[Adult R&B Songs|''Billboard'' Adult R&B]] chart.

Born and raised in [[Kedah]] and [[Selangor]], she began writing songs at age 14. She soon taught herself to play guitar, and by 2006, in need of a creative outlet while attending law school, performed for an audience for the first time. Joined by guitarist Pa'an, bassist Efry Arwis, and drummer Adib Azfar (and later, Adil Ali), Yuna made her recorded debut album in Malaysia in 2008 with a self-titled EP, earned five Malaysian Music Awards nominations (the Malaysian equivalent of the Grammy). She took home four trophies, including Best New Artist and Best Song for her breakthrough hit "[[Yuna discography#Other songs|Dan Sebenarnya]]".

The ''Decorate'' (EP) followed two years later. ''Decorate'' included the viral hit "Rocket," which won raves from ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine, indie rock radio station [[KEXP]], and hip-hop mogul [[Russell Simmons]], as well as a feature in ''[[SPIN (magazine)|Spin]]''{{'}}s "Eight Bands You Need to Hear Now". For her performances, Yuna was nominated as one of MTV's Iggy's Best New Bands in the World in 2011, and she marked the occasion by playing at the historic [[MTV]] Studios.

The 2012 single "[[Live Your Life (Yuna song)|Live Your Life]]", produced by [[Pharrell Williams]], was a preamble to her self-titled full-length debut, which arrived that April. That summer, Yuna appeared at [[Lollapalooza]]. In 2013, Yuna returned with the album [[Nocturnal (Yuna album)|''Nocturnal'']], featuring the single "Falling". In February 2016, Yuna previewed her third album with the release of "Places to Go", a single produced by hip-hop artist [[DJ Premier]]. The full album, [[Chapters (Yuna album)|''Chapters'']], was released three months later.

In December 2016, ''Chapters'' broke into the Top 10 of the ''Billboard'' Best R&B Albums of 2016: Critic's Pick; ''Chapters'' ranked at number 7. Yuna received an award for the Most Successful Malaysian Singer from the [[Malaysian Book Of Records]]. Chapters was also nominated in the Top 20 Best R&B Albums of 2016 by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Yuna performed as a special guest at the 2016 [[Soul Train Music Awards]].

In May 2017, Yuna became the first Malaysian singer to be nominated for a [[BET Awards|BET Award]]; Yuna received a nomination for the [[BET Centric Award]] for "Crush", her duet single with Usher.
