Raised in [[Colombia]], Juanes began playing piano at age two. When Juanes was 17, he started his first band, [[Ekhymosis]], in 1988, which went on to release Eight albums, achieving recognition in his native country of Colombia.

His follow-up album, ''[[Un Día Normal]]'', was released in 2002 and was later certified platinum in Guatemala and Uruguay throughout Latin America.  Juanes' third album, ''[[Mi Sangre]]'' (2004), which became an international bestseller, managing to position well in a number of countries around the world, achieved success due to the single "[[La Camisa Negra]]".
