==History==
Zack de la Rocha had known Jon Theodore for several years before the band was formed and was very impressed with his skills as a drummer, comparing him to [[John Bonham]] and [[Elvin Jones]].<ref name="la times">{{cite web |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/08/these-days-the.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080813182341/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/soundboard/2008/08/these-days-the.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 13, 2008 |title=Zack de la Rocha talks to Ann Powers |date=August 11, 2008 |work=LA Times |publisher=Eddy Hartenstein }}</ref> The duo first started playing together at a mutual friends rehearsal room with Theodore on drums and de la Rocha playing an old [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] Mark 1 keyboard through a [[delay (audio effect)|delay pedal]] and an old [[heavy metal (music)|metal]] amplifier.<ref name="la times"/> The band's name was taken from an infamous black and white [[graffiti]] photograph taken by [[Chicano]] photographer George Rodriguez in 1970 reading "It's better to live one day as a lion, than a thousand years as a lamb."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onedayasalion.org/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828031417/http://www.onedayasalion.org/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 28, 2008 |title=About |access-date=July 7, 2008 |format=[[Adobe Flash]] |work=One Day as a Lion }}</ref>  This comes from a [[wikt:minatory|minatory]] slogan popular during the 1930s in [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], "Better one day as a lion than a hundred days as a sheep."<ref>{{cite book |title=Ideology and International Relations in the Modern World |url=https://archive.org/details/ideologyinternat00cass |url-access=limited |last=Cassels |first=Alan |author-link=Alan Cassels |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-11926-X |page=[https://archive.org/details/ideologyinternat00cass/page/n173 159] |quote=Now the time had come, in Mussolini's words, for 'reaching out to the people', the only ideological ''raison d'être'' he had to fall back on was militant nationalism.  Therefore, 1930s Italy was deluged with slogans at once minatory and somehow ridiculous: 'Better one day as a lion than a hundred years as a sheep'; 'War is to man what motherhood is to woman'; 'Whoever has iron has bread'.}}</ref>  The saying is an allusion to [[Psalms]] 84:10, "Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere." The band had soon written a number of songs and signed with [[Bad Religion]] guitarist and co-founder [[Brett Gurewitz]]'s record label [[ANTI-]].<ref name="la times"/>

On July 16, 2008, the song "[[Wild International]]" was made available to stream on the band's [[MySpace]] profile and was given its Australian radio premiere by [[Triple J]] and American radio premiere by [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]]. The band's [[One Day as a Lion (EP)|eponymous debut EP]] was released on July 18, 2008 on the Anti-label in Australia and four days later in the US, and was also released on [[iTunes Store|iTunes]]. The vinyl version was released on October 7, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=392321032&blogID=437646319 |title=New Merch Store |date=October 3, 2008}}</ref> The EP placed as the 28 album of the week,<ref name="sales"/> selling 17,000 copies in its first week.<ref name="sales">{{cite web |url=http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=816353 |title=Miley Cyrus Leads Sales Charge |date=July 30, 2008 |work=FMQB |publisher=Friday Morning Quarterback Album Report |quote=One Day As A Lion, the collaboration between Rage Against the Machine's Zach de la Rocha and ex-Mars Volta drummer Jon Theodore, bows at No.&nbsp;28 with its self-titled EP, selling 17,000. |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817082637/http://www.fmqb.com/Article.asp?id=816353 |archive-date=August 17, 2008 }}</ref> The album has sold extremely well for a five track EP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tower.com/one-day-as-lion-cd/wapi/112275246 |title=Tower Records sales numbers |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907024014/http://www.tower.com/one-day-as-lion-cd/wapi/112275246 |archive-date=September 7, 2008 }}</ref>

On August 11, 2008, de la Rocha spoke to the [[Los Angeles Times]] about the new project, his first interview in over eight years. He revealed that a full-length album was scheduled for an Autumn 2008 release,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/43157-rage-and-mars-volta-men-reemerge-with-new-group |title=Rage and Mars Volta men re-emerge with new group |last=Kerr |first=Dave |date=July 2, 2008 |work=The Skinny |publisher=Radge Media Limited |quote=The EP will precede a full length LP due this autumn. }}</ref> and stated that they "want to play shows and be a band and go out and start some noise".<ref name="la times"/> He also mentions adding members to the group, revealing "We're still in the process of forming as a band - we need a keyboard player, I'm not good enough to do it all myself - so that will be rectified soon".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gnrdaily.com/news_detail.asp?id=1467|title=GNR Daily|website=www.gnrdaily.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> The full length album has yet to come out. 

On June 1, 2010, One Day as a Lion announced that they would play their first festival show at the [[Fuji Rock Festival]] in July via MySpace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=392321032&blogId=535228463|title=Featured Content on Myspace|website=myspace.com|access-date=April 19, 2018}}</ref> On July 17 and 18, the band performed live for the first time in [[Pomona, California|Pomona]], [[California]], with [[The Locust|Joey Karam]] of [[The Locust]] on keys. 

During their Australian tour in January 2011, One Day as a Lion dedicated 100% of their [[Melbourne]] show's proceeds to the [[2010–2011 Queensland floods|Queensland flood relief]].<ref>http://www.soundwavetouring.com/news/one-day-as-a-lion-sideshow-flood-benefit-in-melbourne/</ref> In an interview that same month, drummer Jon Theodore confirmed the official addition of Joey Karam to the band, and that a second release was in the works.<ref name="FAST">{{cite web|url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/26871/One-Day-As-A-Lion?page=|title=One Day As A Lion|access-date=February 19, 2011|date=January 7, 2011|work=Faster Louder|publisher=David Swan}}</ref>
