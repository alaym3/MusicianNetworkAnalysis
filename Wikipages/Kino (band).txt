'''Kino''' ({{lang-ru|Кино|lit=cinema, film}}, {{IPA-ru|kʲɪˈno|IPA}}) was a [[Soviet Rock|Soviet rock]] band formed in [[Leningrad]] in 1982, considered to be one of, if not the greatest rock band in the history of Russian music.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Russmus: Кино/Kino|url=http://russmus.net/band/78/|access-date=2020-10-19|website=russmus.net}}</ref> The band was co-founded and headed by [[Viktor Tsoi]], who wrote the music and lyrics for almost all of the band's songs. Over the course of eight years, Kino had released over 90 songs spanning over seven studio albums, as well as releasing a few compilations and live albums. The band's music was also widely circulated in the form of [[bootleg recording]]s through the underground [[magnitizdat]] distribution scene. Viktor Tsoi died in a car accident in 1990. Shortly after his passing, the band broke up after releasing their [[Black Album (Kino album)|final album]], consisting of songs that Tsoi and the group were working on in the months before his death.

In 2019, the band announced a reunion with concerts planned in the fall of 2020 for the first time in 30 years, however they were later postponed to 2021 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Russia|COVID-19 pandemic]].

==History==

===Early years===
Kino was formed in 1981 by the members of two earlier groups from [[Leningrad]] (now [[Saint Petersburg]]), Palata No. 6 and Piligrimy. They initially called themselves Garin i giperboloidy ({{Lang-ru|Гарин и гиперболоиды|links=no|lit=Garin and the Hyperboloids}}) after [[Aleksei Nikolaevich Tolstoi|Aleksei Tolstoi]]'s novel ''[[The Hyperboloid of Engineer Garin]]''. The group consisted of [[Viktor Tsoi]], guitarist {{ill|Aleksei Viktorovich Rybin|lt=Aleksei Rybin|ru|Рыбин, Алексей Викторович}}, and drummer {{ill|Oleg Valinsky|ru|Валинский, Олег Сергеевич}}. They began rehearsing, but Valinsky was drafted and had to leave the band. In the spring of 1982, they began to perform at the [[Leningrad Rock Club]] and met with the influential underground musician [[Boris Grebenshchikov]]. It was around this time that they changed the band's name to Kino.<ref>Rybin, Aleksey V. Kino S Samogo Na?ala I Do Samogo Konca. Moscow: Feniks, 2001. Print.</ref>  The name was chosen because it was considered short and "synthetic," and the band members took pride in that it had only two syllables and was easy to pronounce by speakers all over the world.<ref>Victor Tsoi.

Illustrated History of the life and work of Viktor Tsoi and "Kino". – M .: ANTA, 2005. – S. 346. – {{ISBN|5-94037-066-7}}</ref>

===''45 ''and the beginning of a career (1982)===
Kino released their debut album, ''[[45 (Kino album)|45]]'', in 1982. Since the band only consisted of two members, Grebenshchikov suggested that members of his band [[Aquarium (band)|Aquarium]] assist Kino in recording the album. These included cellist [[Vsevolod Gakkel]], flautist {{ill|Andrei Romanov (musician)|lt=Andrei Romanov|ru|Романов, Дюша}}, and bassist {{ill|Mikhail Faynshteyn-Vasilyev|ru|Файнштейн-Васильев, Михаил Борисович}}. Since they had no drummer at the time, they used a drum machine. This simple line-up made the album sound lively and bright. Lyrically, it resembled earlier Soviet [[Bard (Soviet Union)|bard music]] for its romanticism of city life and the use of poetic language.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/45-mw0001266544|title=45 - Kino - Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> The album consisted of thirteen songs and was named ''45'' in reference to its length. The group's popularity was rather limited at the time, so the album was not considered much of a success. Tsoi later stated that the record had come out crudely and he should have recorded it differently.<ref>Kushnir, Alexander. 100 Great Albums of Soviet Rock. Moskow: Kraft+, 2003. Print.</ref>

===In between (late 1982–1984)===
In late 1982, Kino attempted to record a second album at the studio of the [[Maly Drama Theatre]], along with drummer {{ill|Valery Kirilov|ru|Кирилов, Валерий Юрьевич}} (who later joined [[Zoopark]]) and sound designer Andrey Kuskov. However, Tsoi lost interest in the project and they ceased recording. In the winter of 1983, they played several shows in Leningrad and [[Moscow]] and were sometimes accompanied by [[Aquarium (band)|Aquarium]] drummer {{ill|Pyotr Troshchenkov|ru|Трощенков, Пётр Петрович}}. Rybin was replaced by rehearsal bassist Maksim Kolosov and later, guitarist [[Yuri Kasparyan]]. According to Grebenshchikov, Kasparyan was a poor guitar player initially, but he quickly progressed and eventually became the second most important member of Kino.<ref>Boris Grebenshikov. ''We were both pilots in the neighboring fighters''. Kinoman.net</ref> With Kolosov and Kasparyan, Kino performed their second concert at the Leningrad Rock Club.<ref>Rybin, Chapter 7.</ref>

The band's responsibilities were split evenly between Tsoi and Rybin. Tsoi was in charge of the creative component, writing music and lyrics, while Rybin did all the administrative work, such as organizing concerts, rehearsals and recording sessions. In March 1983, a serious conflict broke out between them, the culmination of multiple differences between the two musicians. Tsoi was particularly annoyed that Rybin performed his songs, and not his own writing, while Rybin didn't like Tsoi's unconditional leadership of the group.<ref>Alexey Rybin . "And the fish and meat" – Interview with Aleksei Rybin. – Roxy, № 6, 1983.</ref> Eventually, the two stopped talking, and Rybin left the band.<ref>Rybin, Chapter 8.</ref>

The only audio document from this period was a bootleg called [[46 (album)|46]], which consisted of demos of new songs by Tsoi. These songs continued with the romanticism of ''45'', but also had darker undertones. Tsoi dismissed the recording as "only a rehearsal tape," but many fans viewed it as Kino's second record. Nonetheless, it has never been recognized as a legitimate album by the band.<ref name="eleven" />

===''Nachalnik Kamchatki'' and growing fame (1984–1985)===
In 1984, Kino released their sophomore album, ''[[Nachalnik Kamchatki]] ''({{Lang-ru|Начальник Камчатки|links=no}}). The title was inspired by Tsoi's job as a boiler plant operator ("nachalnik" means 'chief' or 'boss,' and "Kamchatka" is slang for 'a very faraway place' – but also a folk name for the boiler plant where Tsoi worked, now his museum), as well as a reference to the 1967 Soviet comedy ''Nachalnik Chukotki'' ({{Lang-ru|Начальник Чукотки|links=no}}). Again, Grebenshchikov served as a producer and brought many of his friends to help with the record. Among them were [[Alexander Titov (rock musician)|Alexander Titov]] (bass guitar), [[Sergey Kuryokhin]] (keyboards), Pyotr Troshchenkov (drums), Vsevolod Gakkel (cello), [[Igor Butman]] (sax), and Andrey Radchenko (drums). Grebenshchikov played a small keyboard instrument. The album was minimalist in style, with sparse arrangements and usage of fuzz effects on Kasparyan's guitar. "The album was electric and somewhat experimental in sound and form. I cannot say that the sound and style orientation turned out the way we'd like to see it, but from the point of view of the experiment, it looked interesting," said Tsoi later.<ref name="eleven">Andrew Burlaka. Volume II. Kino / / Rock Encyclopedia. Popular Music in Leningrad-St Petersburg 1965–2005 . – M.: Amphora, 2007. – 416 p. – {{ISBN|978-5-367-00362-8}}</ref>

After the album was finished, Tsoi formed the electric section of Kino, which included Kasparyan on lead guitar, Titov on bass guitar, and [[Georgy Guryanov]] on percussion, and in May 1984, they began to actively rehearse a new concert program. Kino then performed at II Festival at the Leningrad Rock Club, where they were highly acclaimed and began to take off in popularity. The group soon became famous and started to tour the Soviet Union.<ref name=eleven /> In the summer, they participated in a critically acclaimed joint performance with Aquarium and other bands held in the Moscow suburb of {{ill|Nikolina Gora|ru|Николина Гора}} under the close supervision of the state security forces. In 1985, Kino released their third album, ''[[Eto ne lyubov...]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockhell.spb.ru/|title=Rockhell - информационный ресурс мировой и отечественной рок-культуры|website=Rockhell.spb.ru|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref>

===''Noch ''and nationwide recognition (1985–1986)===
[[File:Kino1986leningrad.jpg|thumb|right|Viktor Tsoi and Yuri Kasparyan at a concert in Leningrad, 1986.]]
In early 1985, Kino attempted to record another album, but Tsoi did not like producer [[Andrei Tropillo|Andrei Tropillo's]] interference in his work, and the project was left unfinished.<ref name=eleven />

In November 1985, Titov decided to leave Kino in favour of Aquarium, of which he was also a member. He was replaced by jazz guitarist {{ill|Igor Tikhomirov (musician)|lt=Igor Tikhomirov|ru|Тихомиров, Игорь Рувимович}}, who remained part of Kino's "classic lineup" until its end.<ref name=eleven />

In January 1986, Tropillo released the unfinished record the band had recorded in his studio a few months earlier. The album, entitled ''[[Noch (album)|Noch]]'' ({{Lang-ru|Ночь|links=no|lit=Night}}) sold two million copies, making the group famous far beyond the rock community. However, the band had an extremely negative view of the release of this album. They received very little money from the sales of the record, and the underground rock press also criticized the album.<ref name=eleven />

In the spring the band performed at the IV Festival Rock Club, where they received the grand prize for the song "Dalshe deystvovat budem my" ({{Lang-ru|«Дальше действовать будем мы»|links=no|lit=From Now On, We'll Be in Charge}}). In the summer, they traveled to [[Kiev]] to make a film with [[Sergei Lysenko (filmmaker)|Sergei Lysenko]] called [[:ru:%D0%9A%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%86_%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%83%D0%BB | ''Konets Kanikul'']], "End of Summer Break," (23 min., IMDb [https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2290966/ ID 2290966]).  The film consists of a story line that sequences three of Kino's songs followed by the aforementioned song.  In July, they performed at the Moscow Palace of Culture Engineering along with Aquarium and [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]]. Afterwards, the three bands released a compilation called ''[[Red Wave]]''.<ref name="preobrazhensky1">{{cite web|url=http://www.kinoman.net/|title=Цой Виктор и группа "Кино"!|website=Kinoman.net|access-date=8 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228163855/http://www.kinoman.net/|archive-date=28 December 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The album sold 10,000 copies in California, becoming the first release of Soviet rock music in the West.<ref>Всеволод Гаккель .

===''Gruppa krovi'' and critical acclaim (1986–1988)===
From 1986 to 1988, Tsoi began to act in more movies and continued to write songs for Kino. The film ''[[Needle (1988 film)|The Needle]] ''({{Lang-ru|Игла|links=no|translit=Igla}}), which he starred in, brought the band to even more prominence, and their 1988 album ''[[Gruppa krovi]]'' ({{Lang-ru|«Группа крови»|links=no|lit=Blood group}}) brought them to the pinnacle of their popularity.<ref name=eleven /> Kasparyan had married the American [[Joanna Stingray]], who brought the group high-quality equipment from abroad. Thus, the technical equipment Kino used on this album far exceeded the equipment they had access to on their earlier albums, and it was their first record technically on par with European and American recordings.<ref name=fourteen>Foss, Richard.

[[AllMusic]]</ref> Russian journalist [[Alexander Zhitinsky]] called ''Gruppa krovi'' one of the best works of Russian music and said that it elevated Russian rock to a new level.<ref>Alexander Zhytynsky.

Kino performed on central television in the Soviet Union, and ''[[Assa (film)|Assa]]'', a 1987 film featuring Russian rock, showed Tsoi performing "[[Khochu peremen]]!" ({{Lang-ru|«Хочу перемен»|links=no|lit=I want change!}}) in front of a crowd of thousands. After this, Kino's popularity swept the country, and their music captured the minds of the Soviet youth of the 1980s.<ref name=eleven />

===''Zvezda po imeni Solntse'' and global popularity (1989–1990)===
Soon after gaining national fame, Kino began to receive invitations to perform from all over the [[Eastern Bloc]] and even from some foreign countries. They participated in a charity contest in [[Denmark]] to raise money for relief from the [[1988 Armenian earthquake|earthquake in Armenia]] and performed at the largest French rock festival in [[Bourges]] and at the Soviet-Italian festival Back in the U.S.S.R. in [[Melpignano]]. In 1989, they travelled to [[New York City|New York]] and held a premiere of ''The Needle'', as well as a small concert.<ref name=eleven />

In 1989, they released ''[[Zvezda po imeni Solntse]] ''({{Lang-ru|Звезда по имени Солнце|links=no|lit=A Star Called Sun}}), which was lonely, introspective, and sad, despite the fame the band was enjoying.<ref name="preobrazhensky1"/> Kino appeared on the popular Soviet television program ''[[Vzglyad (TV program)|Vzglyad]] ''and attempted to record several video clips. While Tsoi was unsatisfied with them and insisted that they be removed, they were nonetheless shown frequently on television.<ref>Marianne Tsoi, Alexander Zhytynsky  ''Viktor Tsoi. Poems. Documents.Memories .'' – Issue 1. – St. Petersburg: New Helicon, 1991. – S. 291. – 368 p. – (Stars of Rock 'n' Roll). – {{ISBN|5-85-395-018-5}}</ref>

Around this time, the band decided to create a separate pop band to perform their more light-hearted songs to balance the pop songs that helped them gain popularity with Tsoi's introspective musings.<ref>Anton Chernin.

In 1990, Kino performed at [[Luzhniki Stadium]], where the organizers lit the Olympic flame,<ref name=eleven /> which had been lit only four times before (at the [[Moscow Olympics]] in 1980, the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1985, the [[Goodwill Games]] in 1986, and the Moscow International Peace Festival 1989.)<ref>Arthur Gasparyan.

===''Chеrny albom ''and the end of Kino (1990)===
In June 1990, after finishing a lengthy touring season, the band decided to take a short break before recording an album in France. However, on August 15, Tsoi died in a car crash near [[Tukums]] while returning from a fishing trip.<ref>''The death of Tsoi: how the accident occurred on the road Sloka-Tulsa.'' INFOgraphics . RIA Novosti (15 August 2007)</ref>

Before Tsoi died, they had recorded several songs in [[Latvia]], and the remaining members of Kino finished the album as a tribute to him. While it had no official title, it is often called the ''[[Black Album (Kino album)|Black Album]]'' ({{Lang-ru|Чёрный альбом|links=no|translit=Chorny albom}}) in reference to its all-black cover. It was released in December 1990, and shortly after, Kino and others close to Tsoi held a press conference announcing the end of the band.<ref>Alexander Kushnir. Chapter II.

===Reunions (2012, 2019–present)===
In 2012, on what would have been Tsoi's fiftieth birthday the band briefly reunited to record the song "Ataman", which had originally been intended to feature on the ''Black Album''. The song wasn't featured on the album at release because the only recording that existed of the song contained only low-quality vocals. This was the final release of the band and the final song to feature Georgy Guryanov who died on 20 July 2013, from complications of [[hepatitis C]], [[liver cancer|liver]] and [[pancreatic cancer]], at the age of 52.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ria.ru/culture/20130720/951045268.html |title=Барабанщик группы "Кино" Гурьянов скончался в Петербурге &#124; РИА Новости |website=Ria.ru |date=2013-07-20 |access-date=2013-08-05}}</ref>

In 2019, the band announced a reunion with concerts planned in the fall of 2020 for the first time in 30 years. It would feature the band's guitarist [[Yuri Kasparyan]] and bass guitarists [[Alexander Titov (rock musician)|Alexander Titov]] and Igor Tikhomirov. It would also use Viktor's voice, digitized from original multichannel recordings, and be accompanied by a "unique video sequence". Viktor Tsoi's son, Alexander, became the band's producer.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rg.ru/2019/10/12/reg-szfo/gruppa-kino-prervet-30-letnee-molchanie-dvumia-koncertami.html|title=Группа "Кино" прервет 30-летнее молчание двумя концертами|website=rg.ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://esquire.ru/relaxation/129282-muzykanty-gruppy-kino-soberutsya-spustya-30-let-i-dadut-koncerty-v-moskve-i-peterburge-v-2020-godu/|title=Музыканты группы «Кино» соберутся спустя 30 лет и дадут концерты в Москве и Петербурге в 2020 году|website=esquire.ru|date=12 October 2019}}</ref> However, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Russia|COVID-19 pandemic]], the concerts were postponed to 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rbc.ru/society/24/09/2020/5f6cbf1f9a79470c167bba1a|title=Воссоединившаяся группа «Кино» перенесла концерты из-за пандемии|website=rbc.ru|date=24 September 2020}}</ref>

In March 2021, a new live album called ''Kino in Sevkabel'' was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://reproduktor.net/2021/03/kino-v-sevkabele-kak-pesni-viktora-coya-po-novomu-zazvuchali/|title=Кино в Севкабеле: как песни Виктора Цоя по-новому зазвучали|website=reproduktor.ru|date=10 March 2021}}</ref>

==Style==
All Kino songs were written by Viktor Tsoi. His lyrics are characterized by a poetic simplicity.<ref name=eleven /> The ideas of liberty were present (one song was named "Mother Anarchy") but, on the whole, the band's message to the public was not overly or overtly political, except for the recurring theme of freedom. Their songs largely focused on man's struggle in life and dealt with such overarching themes as love, war, and the pursuit of liberty. When asked about the social and political themes of his music, Tsoi said that his songs were works of art and he did not wish to engage in journalism.<ref name=lyrics>Alex Astrov.

As one of the first Russian rock bands, Kino greatly influenced later bands.<ref>Svetlana Gudezh. Audition: Direct speech. Zvuki.Ru (30 March 2009).</ref> On December 31, 1999, Russian rock radio station [[Nashe Radio]] announced the 100 best Russian rock songs of the 20th century based on listener votes. Kino had ten songs in the list, more than any other band, and "Gruppa Krovi" took the first place. The Russian newspaper [[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] listed Kino as the second most influential Russian band ever (after [[Alisa (Russian band)|Alisa]].)<ref>Leonid Zakharov. Groups that have changed our world.  Moscow :Komsomolskaya Pravda, July 6, 2004.</ref> In addition, "Gruppa Krovi" was listed as one of forty songs that changed the world in a 2007 Russian-language edition of ''[[Rolling Stone]].''<ref>Editors Rolling Stone. 40 songs that changed the world / / Rolling Stone Russia . -Moscow : Publishing House SPN, in October 2007.</ref>

Tsoi's simple, relatable lyrical style was very accessible to Kino's audience and helped them gain popularity throughout the Soviet Union. While not excessively political, their music coincided with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s liberal reforms such as [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]]. Additionally, the Western style of their music increased the popularity of Western culture in the Soviet Union.<ref name=rem>Sabrina Jaszi; Steve Huey '[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kino-mn0000738082 'Kino''. AllMusic]</ref>

Kino has remained popular in modern Russia, and Tsoi, in particular, is a cult hero. The group's popularity is referred to as "Kinomania," and fans of the group are known as "Kinophiles."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockarchive.ru/|title=Энциклопедия рока|website=Rockarchive.ru|access-date=8 June 2019}}</ref> In Moscow, there is a [[Tsoi Wall]], where fans leave messages for the musician, and the boiler room where Tsoi once worked is a place of pilgrimage for fans of Russian rock.<ref>Alex Plutser-Sarno.
