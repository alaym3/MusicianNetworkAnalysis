'''The House of Love''' are an English [[alternative rock]] band, formed in London in 1986 by singer-songwriter-guitarist [[Guy Chadwick]] and co-founder and lead guitarist [[Terry Bickers]]. They rose to prominence in 1987 with their first single "[[Shine On (The House of Love song)|Shine On]]", released on the independent label [[Creation Records|Creation]]. The following year, the band released their critically acclaimed [[The House of Love (1988 album)|eponymous debut album]] and built their reputation over the next few years through subsequent releases, constant touring and the support of English press. They signed with [[Fontana Records]] in 1989 and met commercial success in 1990 with their [[The House of Love (1990 album)|second self-titled album]], which peaked at number 8 in the [[UK albums chart]]. Their third album, ''[[Babe Rainbow]]'', was favourably met by the critics in 1992 and also reached the top 40 in the UK.

The House of Love are best known for their detailed [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] guitar sound and for other singles such as "Christine" and "Destroy the Heart". In the US, the songs "I Don't Know Why I Love You", "Marble" and "You Don't Understand" were also popular on alternative rock radio stations, respectively reaching number two, number five and number nine on the [[Alternative Songs|''Billboard'' Modern Rock chart]]. The House of Love disbanded in 1993. After a hiatus of 10 years, they reformed in 2003 with Bickers, who had performed on their two first albums. They have been cited as an influence by [[shoegazing]] bands [[Slowdive]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/8195/Slowdive-Interview |publisher=pennyblackmusic.co.uk |title=Slowdive Interview |first= Anthony |last=Strutt |date=10 April 2016 |access-date=1 August 2017}}</ref> and [[Ride (band)|Ride]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Dave|last=Heaton|url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/ride-030408.shtml|title=In a Different Place Interviews with Andy Bell and Mark Gardener of Ride|publisher=popmatters.com|access-date=1 August 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040224132142/http://www.popmatters.com/music/interviews/ride-030408.shtml|archive-date=24 February 2004|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In 2020, Chadwick announced a change of line-up and that he had recruited a new band.

==History==
===Formation and debut album (1986–1989)===
The House of Love were formed in 1986 in [[Camberwell]], London by former Kingdoms singer and guitarist [[Guy Chadwick]]: he had been inspired to start a new band after seeing [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]] in concert at London's ''[[Electric Ballroom]]''.<ref name=guardian>{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Simpson  |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/feb/08/popandrock | work=The Guardian | title=You only live twice | date=8 February 2005}}</ref><ref name="drbio">Dave Roberts. [https://web.archive.org/web/20110805161749/http://hem.passagen.se/nyholm/holbio.html The House of Love - biography]". February 2005.</ref> He wrote a new song called "Christine", which gave him ideas for further progress: "The idea of the sound of the group and what kind of musicians to look for... female vocals... a good take on the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvets]]' sonics... and of course the image."<ref name="HOL-reissue-notes">Sleevenotes for the 2007 Renascent reissue of ''[[The House of Love (1988 album)|The House of Love]]''</ref> Chadwick teamed up with an old friend – drummer Pete Evans – and recruited the rest of the initial House of Love lineup via an advert in ''[[Melody Maker]]''. This brought together an international band of London-born lead guitarist [[Terry Bickers]] (ex-[[Colenso Parade]]), German rhythm guitarist/co-singer Andrea Heukamp and bass player Chris Groothuizen (from New Zealand).<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="drbio"/><ref name="strong">Strong, Martin C. (1999) ''The Great Alternative & Indie Discography'', Canongate, {{ISBN|0-86241-913-1}}</ref> Chadwick opted to name his new band The House of Love after [[Anaïs Nin]]'s book ''[[A Spy in the House of Love]]''.<ref name="drbio"/><ref name="independent2005">{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-house-of-love-bless-this-house-487973.html | title = The House of Love: Bless this house | work=The Independent | author=Fiona Sturges | access-date= 6 December 2010 | location=London | date=13 April 2005}}</ref> There was a considerable age differential in the band: Chadwick, by now aged 30, was nearly ten years older than Terry Bickers.

Signing to [[Creation Records]], The House of Love released their debut single "[[Shine On (The House of Love song)|Shine On]]" in May 1987<ref name="independent2005"/> and toured with [[Felt (band)|Felt]] and [[Zodiac Mindwarp]]. During the latter half of 1987, the band continued to tour: a third on the bill placing at a concert at the [[O2 Forum Kentish Town|Town & Country Club]] was widely acclaimed in the press and convinced Creation Records to make them record, "Christine" – which would not be released as a single before mid-1988. "Christine" was also the last of the band's recordings to feature Andrea Heukamp as a full member: having become tired of touring, she quit the band at the end of 1987.<ref name="drbio"/>

Although the split was amicable, Chadwick would later comment "Losing Andrea Heukamp was a massive, massive blow for me: I loved her voice and I loved her playing, she was easily as important as Pete, Terry or Chris."<ref name="HOL-reissue-notes" /> Heukamp appeared in the group shot used for the cover of the band's first long-form release – a 1987 Germany-only compilation of the early recordings, eight songs all of which she had played on. This record was untitled apart from the band name and was consequently just known as ''The House of Love'' or informally as ''The German Album''. Heukamp's split from The House of Love would not be absolute, as she would return as a studio guest on some of the band's subsequent albums.

Following Heukamp's departure, The House of Love began working on their debut album. The recording sessions were completed in just over a week, but the mixing sessions – allegedly fuelled by copious use of [[LSD]] – proved more problematic, with producer Pat Collier dealing with the final mix after disagreements within the band.<ref name="drbio"/> The album was preceded by the release of "Christine" as a single in May 1988, which reached No.&nbsp;1 in the independent charts.<ref name="drbio"/> Later in May, the debut album was released. As with ''The German Album'', the album lacked a formal title anywhere on the sleeve, and therefore became generally known as ''[[The House of Love (1988 album)|The House of Love]]''.<ref name="independent2005"/> A stand-alone single, "Destroy The Heart", was eventually voted single of the year in DJ [[John Peel]]'s Festive Fifty.<ref name="drbio"/>

Following the success of the first album which topped the indie charts in Europe, the band opted to sign to [[Fontana Records]] (and [[PolyGram]] in the US), with Creation label head [[Alan McGee]] continuing for a while as manager. Ominously, by this time the band's drug use had begun to escalate even further, as had internal problems with egos and dissension.<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="drbio"/><ref name="strong" />

The first House of Love release on the Fontana label was the single "Never", which was issued against the band's wishes,<ref name="guardian"/> and stalled just outside the Top 40.<ref name="independent2005"/> During summer 1989, The House of Love played a week-long residency at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|I.C.A.]] in London, varying their sets and featuring support bands as diverse as [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]], [[Stone Roses]] and the [[Rainbirds]].<ref name="drbio"/>

The recording and mixing of the band's next album (and first for Fontana) was beset with problems. The band members were distracted by hedonism, ego and indecision, going through four different producers and multiple studios.<ref name="drbio"/> The stress of Fontana's commercial expectations were also playing a part. In 2005, Chadwick recollected that "the guy who signed us ''(Dave Bates)'' had signed [[Def Leppard]] and [[Tears for Fears]] so he had a lot of clout. He insisted on putting us together with producers who were quite obviously wrong for us. He was completely uninterested in anything that didn't have a huge chorus in it. He wanted hits, basically. He also ordered a load of remixes that we hadn't authorised and we absolutely loathed."<ref name="independent2005"/>

}}Much later, Chadwick was to regard signing with Fontana as the worst mistake in the band's career. At the time, Terry Bickers was of this opinion already. Having always been unhappy with the implications of the Fontana deal, and now feeling justified in his fears, he began to retreat into anxiety and drugs, eventually succumbing to [[manic depression]].<ref name="guardian"/> By this time, Chadwick's own responsibilities and external pressures – fuelled by his growing drug and alcohol habit – would turn him into what he would later describe as "''(a)'' monster. A nice monster, sometimes, but a monster none the less."<ref name="guardian"/> Before much longer, Chadwick and Bickers were no longer talking to each other.<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="independent2005"/>

The next House of Love single, "I Don't Know Why I Love You", was released in November 1989 but stalled at number 41 in the charts despite being Radio 1's Single of the Week.<ref name="drbio"/> A sixty-plus date UK tour was set for the end of the year, with an important press covering and public attention, but this would prove to be the last straw for the band's initial lineup. In 2005 Bickers recollected "After our first album it was manic. A classic case of too much too soon. We needed a break... We had spent eighteen months in the studio recording our second album. Everything we produced got rejected and we were at the end of our ropes. Then as soon as we got the last track down they said 'Right, now off you go on tour'. It was a recipe for disaster."<ref name="independent2005"/>

===Second self-titled album and departure of Terry Bickers (1989–1990)===
During the tour, the increasingly difficult relationship between Chadwick and Bickers worsened and Bickers was abruptly sacked mid-tour.<ref name="independent2005"/> At one day's notice, Simon Walker was recruited directly from My White Bedroom and [[The Dave Howard Singers]] as replacement lead guitarist. He made his debut at the band's concert at Portsmouth Polytechnic on 4 December 1989.<ref name="drbio"/>

Initially, the band claimed that Bickers was taking a break due to exhaustion.<ref name="drbio"/> It soon became clear that the break was permanent, having followed a notorious incident inside the House of Love's tour van when Bickers had begun chanting "Breadhead!" at Chadwick while setting fire to the band's money in a protest against what he saw as the band's increasing commercialisation and materialism.<ref name=volume>[http://www.anyware.co.uk/levitation/volume3.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705191654/http://www.anyware.co.uk/levitation/volume3.html |date=5 July 2008}}</ref> Looking back on the incident two years later, Bickers confessed "That was frustration. I just found at the time that I didn't have the same aspirations as the rest of the band. I was more into exploring music than exploring the exploitation of markets around the globe. They were really into crusading. And winning. I wasn't."<ref name="volume"/>

Bickers would go on to form the psychedelic rock band [[Levitation (band)|Levitation]]<ref name="guardian"/><ref name="drbio"/><ref name="independent2005"/> and for some time, he and Chadwick would continue to spar via the music press. At one point, Chadwick claimed that despite Bickers' stellar reputation as a player it was in fact he himself who had played "90 per cent" of the guitars on the band's recordings (a claim that he later withdrew). Bickers in turn described Chadwick as "a megalomaniac."<ref name="guardian"/> In spite of the feud, over a decade later Chadwick would confess that he had soon come to want Bickers to return to The House of Love but had failed to actually communicate this to Bickers himself.<ref name="guardian" />

The House of Love's ''[[The House of Love (1990 album)|second album]]'' (also untitled, but generally known as either ''House of Love'', the ''Butterfly'' album, or simply ''Fontana'') was released in January 1990;<ref name="strong" /> it reached the top ten in the [[UK Albums Chart]] and peaked at N°148 in the [[Billboard Top 200]], staying in the US chart for 8 weeks.<ref name="bill">[http://www.billboard.com/artist/415061/house-love/chart "House of Love US charts"]. ''Billboard.com''. Retrieved 11 December 2015</ref> It sold worldwide over 400,000 copies.<ref name="drbio"/> "I Don't Know Why I Love You" was heavily played on US alternative rock radios: it reached number 2 on the [[Modern Rock Tracks chart]] in March.<ref name="bill" /> In the UK, the album had been preceded by a newly recorded version of the band's first single, "Shine On": released in seven different formats, the song saw them break into the top 20.<ref name="drbio"/>

The House of Love continued and completed their tour with Simon Walker now firmly settled in as guitarist. The last date of the tour was a sold-out concert at the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref name="drbio"/> This was the band's commercial peak. A fourth single from the ''Fontana'' album – "The Beatles and the Stones" – reached the top 40 of the singles chart in March 1990.<ref name="drbio"/> The House of Love continued to tour in both America and Europe, with former member Andrea Heukamp returning to the band later in the year to add backing vocals.<ref name="strong"/>

A second compilation album called ''[[A Spy in the House of Love (album)|A Spy in the House of Love]]'' was released in late 1990, consisting of older scrapped material and a sampling of the band's large backlog of b-sides. A stopgap measure to keep up the band's momentum, it failed to match the sales of ''Fontana'' (although a promo single, "Marble", reached number 5 in the U.S. Modern Rock charts).<ref name="bill"/>

In early 1991, they undertook a 10 date French tour which peaked at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Olympia]] in Paris; the concert was broadcast live in prime time on radio [[France Inter]]. On 31 August, they decided to perform three London concerts on the same night – the first at the University of London Union in Bloomsbury, the second at the Town & Country Club in Kentish Town and the third at The Boston Arms in Tufnell Park. Despite the publicity stunt nature of the evening, the band received good reviews and it was considered that their challenge had paid off.<ref name="drbio"/> Evans, Walker and Groothuizen then took advantage of the time off to return to My White Bedroom, which released its lone album after two years of delay.<ref name="whitebedroom1">{{cite web|url=http://popmusicaintnoisepollution.blogspot.com/2010/10/ma-chambre-blanche-dans-la-maison-de.html |title=Pop Music Ain't Noise Pollution: Ma chambre blanche dans la maison de l'amour (My White Bedroom / House Of Love) |publisher=Popmusicaintnoisepollution.blogspot.com |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

===''Babe Rainbow'' (1991–1992)===

The delay proved costly for The House of Love, as it ensured that the band lost momentum. It also coincided with the rise of [[grunge]] in the United States and the arrival of The Stone Roses on the British music scene, both of which rapidly consumed the attention of the British music press and rock reviewers. In October 1991, The House of Love returned with a new single "The Girl With the Loneliest Eyes". Although this was hailed in the press as another piece of beautiful pop by the band, it failed to chart (amid accusations of record company distribution incompetence).<ref name="drbio"/> Also that year, the band contributed a cover of "Who by Fire" to the [[Leonard Cohen]] tribute album ''[[I'm Your Fan]]''.

Follow-up recording sessions for their third album were scheduled over a period of six months: former member Andrea Heukamp guested on the studio sessions to add extra guitar and backing vocals.<ref name="drbio"/> Two other singles followed: "Feel" released in April 1992 and "You Don't Understand" which preceded ''[[Babe Rainbow]]''.<ref name="drbio"/><ref name="strong"/> Simon Walker left the group over musical differences at that time and was replaced as guitarist by former [[The Woodentops|Woodentops]] member Simon Mawby.<ref name="drbio"/>

Released in July, ''Babe Rainbow'' was a critical success in the UK,<ref>{{cite news|last=Cavanagh|first=David|title=House Beautiful: The House of Love ''Babe Rainbow''|work=[[Select (magazine)|Select]]|date=August 1992|page=88}}</ref> but only sold respectably (peaking at number 34 on the [[UK Album Chart]]).<ref name="drbio"/><ref name="strong"/> In the US, "You Don't Understand" became a hit on the alternative radio, reaching number 9 on the ''Billboard'' Modern Rock chart.

During 1992, the band attempted to reverse their fortunes with more hard touring (travelling as part of a triple bill with [[Ocean Colour Scene]] and [[Catherine Wheel (band)|Catherine Wheel]], but while the band were still greeted with respect this did not translate into the desired sales. Simon Mawby left the band at the end of the year, once again leaving Chadwick without a lead guitar foil.<ref name="drbio"/> A fourth single taken from the album, "Crush Me", was the band's lowest-placing single release on Fontana, peaking at number 67 in the UK.<ref name="strong"/>

===''Audience with the Mind'' and split (1993)===
The House of Love began work on their fourth album in January 1993. In contrast to previous efforts it was recorded in under two weeks, with Chadwick playing all of the guitar parts and with Groothuizen and Evans contributing (for the first time) to songwriting.<ref name="drbio"/> As with ''Babe Rainbow'', Andrea Heukamp made a guest appearance (this time, only on backing vocals). The band laid plans to record their fifth album later in the year, following a tour of France. However, on their return to London Pete Evans announced to the band that he wanted to retire from the music business.

Uncertain of how to proceed, The House of Love kept Evans' departure under wraps while Chadwick concentrated on promoting the new album, ''[[Audience with the Mind]]'', by himself. The album was released in June 1993 and scraped into the top 40 of the album chart, only remaining in the chart for one week. It showed no sign of reversing the band's commercial decline and no singles from the album were released. Without a drummer, with a group reduced to only two members and a vanishing commercial profile, Chadwick admitted defeat later in the year and disbanded The House of Love. 
<ref name="drbio"/>

===Post break-up (1994–2003)===

By his own admission, some years after the event, Chadwick took the split of The House of Love very badly and succumbed to depression – "It was very hard to get out of bed. I was ill. After the group finished it was such a huge awakening. I just cracked up, and couldn't function for years." Ironically, Chadwick's battles with depression enabled him to better understand why Terry Bickers had left the band, and would eventually lead to a reconciliation between the two.<ref name="guardian"/> Despite his difficulties, he would make several further attempts at a musical career, going on to form The Madonnas in 1994 (splitting the band in 1995) and subsequently the similarly short-lived, Belgium-based Eyedreams in 1996. Neither bands would release any records. He resurfaced as a solo artist in 1997, releasing one album, 1998's ''Lazy Soft and Slow'' produced by [[Cocteau Twins]]' [[Robin Guthrie]].<ref name="drbio"/><ref name="strong"/>
 
Despite Evans' claims of having retired from music, both he and Chris Groothuizen continued for three more years with My White Bedroom.<ref name="whitebedroom1"/> Groothuizen would subsequently coproduce and engineer the debut album for British chansonnier [[Simon Warner (musician)|Simon Warner]] in 1996 before taking on a new career as an architect and lecturer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barnabygunning.com/index.php?type=show&p_ID=16 |title=Barnaby Gunning Architects : Homepage |publisher=Barnabygunning.com |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> From 1994 onwards, Evans began an ongoing collaboration as producer and musician with teenaged singer-songwriter Cat Goscovitch. He contributing heavily to her projects Billy Rain (1994) and Nut (1996) as drummer, guitarist and co-songwriter, and returned as one of her key collaborators in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|author=Lewis Slade |url=http://www.lewisslade.com/catgoscovitch |title=Cat Goscovitch – Discography – lewisslade.com/catgoscovitch |publisher=Lewisslade.com |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://livemusic.fm/band/nut?month=11&year=2010]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120135151/http://livemusic.fm/band/nut?month=11&year=2010 |date=20 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Nut+(3) |title=Nut (3) Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

Terry Bickers stayed with Levitation for two albums before acrimoniously quitting the band onstage in 1993. He went on to form another short-lived [[space rock]] band, Cradle, and was involved briefly in other projects during the late 1990s, but never returned to the prominence or consistent work he had enjoyed with The House of Love and Levitation. In the early 2000s, he re-established contact with Guy Chadwick.

Various re-releases and compilations kept the band in the public eye, including 1998's ''Best of The House of Love'' and 2000's ''The John Peel Sessions 88–89''. In 2001, PLR reissued the entire set of recordings which the band had made during their most critically acclaimed period (on Creation Records) with the release of ''1986–88: The Creation Recordings''. In 2004, ''The Fontana Years'' was released, covering the turbulent period of the second album.

===Reformation and ''Days Run Away'' (2003–2011)===

In 2003, the reconciled Chadwick and Bickers reformed the House of Love<ref name="independent2005"/> at the urging of former agent Mick Griffiths.<ref name="guardian"/> The duo also re-recruited Pete Evans as drummer. Although Chris Groothuizen was invited to re-join and thus reform the "classic" band line-up, he amicably declined, opting instead to remain in his architectural career. His place as bass guitarist was taken by Matt Jury.<ref name="guardian"/> In 2005, the band went on to tour throughout the UK, Ireland and Sweden, and released a comeback album – ''[[Days Run Away]]'' – on the Art & Industry label, to some praise.

Bickers and Chadwick seemed confident that age, perspective and situation meant that they could avoid the problems which had divided the band in 1990. Interviewed at the time of the release of ''Days Run Away'', Chadwick admitted acceptance of the fact that "we're really different people. It's a very complex kind of friendship, and I think it'll always be slightly fractious. We don't have this huge buddy thing going on though at the same time it's very intimate... We've always had a very instinctive way of communicating with each other, which I guess is why we make good music together." Bickers in turn reflected "I think we're both old enough and ugly enough to address any issues head-on and keep our tempers in check. We're also doing things at our own pace rather than letting a record company dictate what we do, which helps... It's still early days but communication is good and so is the music. This is about letting bygones be bygones and just getting on with it. Personally, I've never been happier."<ref name="independent2005" />

''The House of Love'' (the band's 1988 debut album) was reissued on CD in 2007. This led to the band being invited to play the album live in its entirety as part of the Don't Look Back concert series.<ref name="guardian2">{{cite web|last=Chadwick |first=Guy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/sep/05/goingbacktogoforward |title=Looking back to go forward &#124; Music |publisher=theguardian.com |date=5 September 2007 |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref> In 2009, ''Live at the BBC'' featured selections from the band's post-Bickers in concert recordings from 1990 to 1992. In November 2012, Cherry Red announced the release of a 3-CD deluxe edition of their debut self-titled album, adding all the remaining Creation recordings and a whole disc of unissued demos and alternative versions.<ref name="superdeluxeedition">{{cite web|url=http://www.superdeluxeedition.com/news/house-of-love-debut-album-expanded-to-3cds-in-october/ |title=The House of Love / Debut album expanded to 3CDs in November |publisher=superdeluxeedition |access-date=18 April 2014}}</ref>

===''She Paints Words in Red'' and further touring (2012–2019)===
In December 2012, The House of Love Official Facebook page confirmed that the band had recently completed a new studio album. The album was recorded with original members Chadwick, Bickers, Evans accompanied by bassist Matt Jury. In early 2013 the title was revealed as ''[[She Paints Words in Red]]''; it was released in March by Cherry Red Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=She Paints Words in Red – House of Love|url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=4010|publisher=Cherry Red Records|access-date=16 April 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420070906/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/shopexd.asp?id=4010|archive-date=20 April 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The band kept touring the following years.

In 2018 to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their debut album, the band embarked on a six date British tour in autumn,<ref name=tour>[https://www.facebook.com/TheHouseOfLoveOFFICIAL/posts/1906710389391189  The House of Love - UK tour 2018] official.

===Further line-up changes (2020–present)===
