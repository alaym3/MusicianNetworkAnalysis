'''''Twenty88''''' (stylized as '''''TWENTY88''''') is the first [[studio album]] by American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo Twenty88 (composed of rapper [[Big Sean]] and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer-songwriter [[Jhené Aiko]]). It was released on April 1, 2016, by [[Def Jam Recordings]] with licensing to [[GOOD Music]] and [[ARTium Recordings]]. The album features [[guest appearance]]s from the R&B group [[K-Ci & JoJo]], and recording artist and producer [[Detail (record producer)|Detail]]. This project includes [[Record producer|production]] from Detail, [[Key Wane|KeY Wane]], [[Tommy Brown (record producer)|Tommy Brown]], Sidney Swift, Cam O'bi, [[Steve Lacy (musician)|Steve Lacy]], Flippa and Jproof.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BDo4ktvFLkw/|title=FLIPPA123 (@flippa123)|date=2016-03-31|website=[[Instagram]]}}</ref> The album peaked at number five on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

On September 17, 2020, Big Sean revealed that a sequel album is "in the works". A track attributed to the project appeared on Sean's fifth album, ''[[Detroit 2]]'' (2020).<ref name="Works">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/big-sean-reveals-another-twenty88-album-with-jhene-aiko-is-in-the-works-2757036%3famp|title=Big Sean reveals another TWENTY88 album with Jhené Aiko is "in the works"|work=[[NME]]|last=Brereton|first=Greta|date=September 20, 2020|access-date=September 26, 2020}}</ref>

==Background==
On March 28, 2016, Big Sean and Jhené Aiko announced that they were forming a duo, called Twenty88. The [[Los Angeles]] singer and the [[Detroit]] rapper previously collaborated on the songs "[[Beware (Big Sean song)|Beware]]" (with [[Lil Wayne]]) from Sean's second album ''[[Hall of Fame (Big Sean album)|Hall of Fame]]'' (2013), as well as "I Know" from Sean's third album ''[[Dark Sky Paradise]]'' (2015). According to a press release from [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]], the album tells the story of the highs and lows of a relationship, with insights into conflict, memories, love, and sex.<ref name="floppy">{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2016/03/27/big-sean-jhene-aiko-form-duo-twenty88/|title=Big Sean and Jhené Aiko Form Duo Twenty88|date=2016-03-27|access-date=2016-03-28|website=[[Rap-Up]]}}</ref>

On March 29, Sean and Aiko appeared together on the cover of ''[[Flaunt]]'' to promote the album, ''Twenty88''. For the cover story, they talked about the origin of the duo Twenty88, and their vision for the album. Aiko stated: "Music now doesn't really cater to the feelings of a real relationship. It's all about trapping and bragging. I feel like this project is something that's needed right now. Especially a whole project is just good for people to see. That duality is a perfect combination. It's a 70's aesthetic, but we're in the future." They drew from various influences: Blaxploitation films, [[James Bond]], as well as ''[[Ex Machina (film)|Ex Machina]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/big-sean-and-jhene-aiko-cover-flaunt-magazine-news.20836.html?image=3&gallery=0|title=Big Sean & Jhene Aiko Cover Flaunt Magazine|date=2016-03-29|access-date=2016-03-30|website=HotNewHipHop|last=Schwartz|first=Danny}}</ref>

In 2020, Sean talked about how the labels did not back the project despite the chemistry with Aiko and already popular songs they had together. Tidal essentially provided the backing for the project so that Sean and Aiko would not pay for it themselves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thesource.com/2020/02/18/a-breakdown-of-big-seans-pull-up-interview-w-joe-budden/|title = A Breakdown of Big Sean's 'Pull Up' Interview W/ Joe Budden|date = 18 February 2020}}</ref>

==Recording and production==
On March 28, 2016, it was revealed that the album would feature the productions from [[Key Wane]], [[Detail (record producer)|Detail]] and [[Tommy Brown (record producer)|Tommy Brown]].<ref name="floppy"/> Big Sean and Aiko explained what fans could expect on the project. According to [[Uproxx]], the album conjures 90s R&B and 70s experimental rock and soul. It also mixes neo-soul, ambient beats, and trap drums courtesy of producers like [[Da Internz]]. As a whole, ''Twenty88'' is a departure from each artist's individual sounds. "It's a wide range. It gets turned up, then it gets melodic, then it gets vibed out. It touches all these things, but it sounds very cohesive. We've created another world. Both me and Sean are super into fantasy-driven movies and so combining stuff like robots and sex, that pretty much sums us up. Robots are sexy as shit. We've created these characters that are extensions of ourselves, it's highly sexual."<ref name="free"/> In the interview with ''[[Flaunt]]'', it was revealed that [[K-Ci & JoJo]] would be featured on the song, "Two-Minute Warning". The magazine described the song as, "the most sexually explicit song" on the album.<ref name="free">{{cite web|url=http://uproxx.com/smokingsection/big-sean-jhene-aiko-twenty88-new-album-details/|title=Big Sean And Jhene Aiko Revealed 'Twenty88' Will Include Jodeci's K-Ci And JoJo And More|date=2016-03-29|access-date=2016-03-30|website=[[Uproxx]]|author=GOTTY™}}</ref>

==Release and promotion==
On March 27, 2016, Big Sean and Aiko created a [[Twitter]] account for Twenty88 showing two videos promoting the album. The first clip shows both artists sitting in the backseat of a car, and the second shows Aiko being filmed by a robot while she is likely in the middle of sexual intercourse with Sean.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/twenty88?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw|title=TWENTY88 (@twenty88)|date=2016-03-28|via=[[Twitter]]}}</ref> Both of them changed their profile pictures to the same one shown on the account of Twenty88, an album cover that shows Sean's face next to that of Aiko, who is donning an orange wig. They also both edited their Twitter bios to say, "1/2 of Twenty88", suggesting that Aiko and Sean formed the duo. After posting the short videos, they tweeted a picture of the album cover and wrote, "4/1". That tweet was retweeted by both Sean and Aiko and said the album would be released on April 1, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/big-sean-and-jhene-aiko-form-duo-twenty88-project-dropping-this-week-news.20793.html|title=Big Sean & Jhene Aiko Form Duo Twenty88, Project Dropping This Week|date=2016-03-27|access-date=2016-03-28|author=Walker, Angus|website=HotNewHipHop}}</ref>

On March 31, the two made their television debut as Twenty88 on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', performing "Selfish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7311553/big-sean-jhene-aiko-twenty88|title=Big Sean & Jhene Aiko Join Forces for 'Twenty88' Project|date=2016-03-28|access-date=2016-03-28|author=Platon, Adelle|website=[[Billboard.com]]}}</ref> [[Tidal (service)|Tidal]] streamed the project exclusively for 72 hours starting on April 1, 2016. It was also available for purchase on [[iTunes]] the same day, and shared on other streaming platforms on April 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2016/03/big-sean-jhene-aiko-twenty-88-release-date|title=Big Sean and Jhené Aiko Reveal New Collaborative Project, 'TWENTY88'|date=2016-03-27|access-date=2016-03-28|website=[[Complex.com]]|last=Ortiz|first=Edwin}}</ref> On April 4, 2016, the album was made available on Spotify and Apple Music. After the release of their debut album, on April 8, 2016, the duo released a short video, titled "Out of Love", exclusively on Tidal.

''Twenty88'' received positive reviews from music critics. The album received a score of 72/100 on Metacritic. Scott Glaysher of ''[[HipHopDX]]'' said, "''Twenty88'' is a pleasant surprise from two artists who are the top of their respective games. Their chemistry is unquestionable and the music derived from that unique harmony is constantly improving. Whether this is a complete one-off project or if they continue to make music under this duo moniker remains to be seen but for now, these eight songs will tide over the hopeless romantic in everyone."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopdx.com/reviews/id.2679/title.big-sean-jhene-aiko-twenty88|title=Big Sean & Jhene Aiko - "TWENTY88"|date=2016-04-01|access-date=2016-04-06|website=[[HipHopDX]]|last=Glaysher|first=Scott}}</ref>

Patrick Lyons of ''HotNewHipHop'' said: "If everything else about these eight tracks was just as bad, it'd be easy to write off, but the true tragedy is that ''Twenty88'' seems like it could have been salvaged if Sean and Aiko just spent some more time writing. There are some truly intriguing concepts and song structures here, especially "Talk Show", where our two stars address each other like they're sitting on the couch of a relationship counseling show. Then there's the music itself. Flippa and frequent Sean collaborator [[Key Wane]] handle most of the production, and similarly to dvsn's Sept. 5th, they do an excellent job of updating classic R&B sounds into something sleek and modern. Sampling from sources as varied as [[Xscape (group)|Xscape]], British DJ [[Mat Zo]], old jazz standard 'Sentimental Journey,' and an effortlessly breezy '70s soul deep cut, they do a much better job than the vocalists at deploying a bunch of disparate elements for the end goal of creating something thematically linked but episodic. Wane has been steadily building on a ''[[Graduation (Kanye West album)|Graduation]]''-era Kanye sound for years now, and his work here is yet another marked improvement on his past discography; I had never heard of Flippa before this, but he's just as impressive. They both seem to have put a ton of time into flipping samples, constructing beats, and structuring songs, and it's disappointing when it doesn't feel like the people on the other side of the boards put in nearly as much work."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/review-big-sean-and-jhen-aikos-twenty88-news.20949.html|title=Review: Big Sean & Jhené Aiko's "TWENTY88"|date=2016-04-06|access-date=2016-04-06|last=Lyons|first=Patrick|website=HotNewHipHop}}</ref>
