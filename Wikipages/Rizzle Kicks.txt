==Musical career==

===2006–2011: Formation and career beginnings===
In 2006, Stephens began attending rap and performance workshops with the Brighton-based charity AudioActive, joined a year later by Alexander-Sule. The pair attended AudioActive's Hip Hop Foundation project and Stephens continued attending workshops and performances until 2010. Stephens is quoted as saying this work helped the duo "hone our skills and build a passion towards the career that we're in now. AudioActive did us a lot of good and without them we wouldn't be here!"<ref>{{cite web|last = Stephens|first = Jordan|title = AudioActive website|url = http://www.audioactive.org.uk|access-date = 28 February 2013}}</ref>

Stephens and Alexander-Sule both attended the [[BRIT School]], where Stephens studied media and Alexander-Sule studied theatre. Stephens was in the process of making his mixtape ''Minor Breaches of Discipline'' where he rapped over samples of some of their favourite artists ([[Gorillaz]], [[Lily Allen]], [[Arctic Monkeys]]) and asked Alexander-Sule to sing over some of the tracks. Realising how well their styles fitted together, they formed Rizzle Kicks in 2008.<ref name="rizzlekicks1">{{cite web |author = Rizzle Kicks |url = http://www.rizzlekicks.com/about |title = Biography www.rizzlekicks.com/ |publisher = Rizzle Kicks |access-date = 2011-10-13 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111021062847/http://www.rizzlekicks.com/about |archive-date = 21 October 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> The name stems from 'Green [[Rizla]]', an early nickname given to Stephens by a [[association football|football]] teammate after a crew of the same name from the school that he attended at the time. That nickname evolved into 'Rizzle', and the duo decided on the suffix 'kicks' due to their shared love of football.<ref>{{cite web |author = Music |url = http://www.pyromag.com/music/13551/rizzle-kicks-interview/ |title = Rizzle Kicks Interview |publisher = PyroMag.com |access-date = 2012-02-24 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120205123415/http://www.pyromag.com/music/13551/rizzle-kicks-interview/ |archive-date = 5 February 2012 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

As a newly formed duo, they hustled for beats from local producers, honing their sound, and created several bedroom demos, three of which ended up on their debut album. They also created a presence online; blogging on their website "Your Daily Kicks" as well as posting lo-fi music videos to their [[YouTube]] channel.<ref>{{cite news|author = Rizzle Kicks |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/youtube-and-the-modern-road-to-stardom-2373499.html |title = YouTube and the modern road to stardom/ |publisher = Independent |date = 21 October 2011|access-date = 2011-10-21 |location=London}}</ref> The videos were co-directed by the band and made by Toby Lockerbie, a wedding photographer they met at a party. A video was made for a demo of "[[Down with the Trumpets]]" in the summer of 2010, closely followed by the video for "Miss Cigarette". During that time, they had finished college and Alexander-Sule went on to work as an assistant drama teacher, whilst Stephens was flipping burgers at the Corals Greyhound Stadium in [[Hove]].
