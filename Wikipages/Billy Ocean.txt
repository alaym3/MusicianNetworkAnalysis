==Early life and stardom==
Ocean was born in [[Fyzabad]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], then part of the [[British Windward Islands]], to Hainsley Charles, a [[Grenada|Grenadian]] musician<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/billy-ocean-mn0000089058/biography|title=Billy Ocean – Biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=19 September 2014}}</ref> and his wife Violet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northwales.co.uk/latest-news/billy-ocean/|title=Billy Ocean|website=Northwales.co.uk|access-date=2 November 2014}}</ref> He moved to [[Romford]], England when he was ten years old, just before Trinidad and Tobago became independent in 1962. He was exposed to music at an early age. During his teenage years, he sang regularly in London [[nightclub|clubs]]<ref name="AMG"/> while also working as a tailor in London's [[Savile Row]]. He was discovered by his first manager, John Morphew, who recorded a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] single at [[Pye Records|Pye Studios]] in London with a full orchestra. However, the ballad singing style of Ocean was going out of fashion and Morphew was unable to get any major label to release it. It remains unreleased. Ocean's father — who had countersigned the management contract as Ocean was underage — asked Morphew to release him from contract, which he did without penalty. In 1969, he joined a local band, The Shades of Midnight, playing in the [[Shoreditch]] area of London. He recorded his first single, "Nashville Rain", backed with "Sun in the Morning" in 1971 for [[Spark Records]] as Les Charles, and for two years fronted a studio band called Scorched Earth, with whom he released "On the Run" backed with "Let's Put Our Emotions in Motion" in 1974.

In an interview with [[Myfanwy Warhurst]] on [[ABC Radio Melbourne]], Ocean stated that the story of him having taken his stage name from the local "Ocean Estate", [[Stepney]] in London's [[East End of London|East End]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/338/caribbean_king/|title=Billy Ocean: Caribbean King|author=Pete Lewis|work=Blues & Soul|access-date=1 January 2012}}</ref> where he was living at the time, was in fact not correct. According to the interview, the name was derived from a local football team that was in his home town in Trinidad and Tobago, who called themselves "Oceans 11".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.abc.net.au/radio/melbourne/programs/myf-warhurst/myf-warhurst/11188218|title=Billy Ocean, History of Australian toys, breaking up, a 9/11 comedy|date=2019-06-07|website=ABC Radio|language=en-AU|access-date=2019-06-13}}</ref> In 1976, he [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] his first album, ''Billy Ocean'', with its first single release, "[[Love Really Hurts Without You]]", charting at No. 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and No. 22 in the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. He enjoyed club success from the songs "Are You Ready" and "Stay The Night" from the album ''City Limit'' — both of which were later covered by [[La Toya Jackson]]. More successes ensued, including "L.O.D. (Love on Delivery)". He also [[songwriter|wrote and composed]] songs for other artists. In 1981, he scored the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|US R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] with "Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)."

==International success==
Between 1976 and 1982, Ocean released four albums (''Billy Ocean'', ''City Limit'', ''Nights (Feel Like Getting Down)'' and ''Inner Feelings'')<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|page=187}}</ref> through his record label [[GTO Records|GTO]], none of which scored success on any musical charts, aside from his biggest single up to that point, 1976's "[[Love Really Hurts Without You]]", which was a top 40 and a top 10 hit in both the UK (No. 2) and the US (No. 22).<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

As [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]] acquired GTO Records in 1978, Ocean was shifted to [[Jive Records|Jive]] from [[Epic Records|Epic]], in which he received a second breakthrough in his career in the early 1980s. Late 1984 saw the release of his fifth studio album ''[[Suddenly (Billy Ocean album)|Suddenly]]'' and its main single, "[[Caribbean Queen (No More Love on the Run)]]" becoming successes on the charts.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> "Caribbean Queen" became Ocean's first number one single on both the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Hot Black Singles]] charts in late 1984, and the album debuted in the top ten, peaking at No. 9 on both the [[Billboard 200|US ''Billboard'' 200]] and the [[UK Albums Chart]] simultaneously in the US and UK.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> ''Suddenly'' reached [[gold record|gold]] in the UK, and was certified [[Platinum record|double platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] (Recording Industry Association of America). He also recorded with [[Scott Walker (singer)|Scott Walker]] in 1984, singing on his album ''[[Climate of Hunter]].''

“Caribbean Queen” scored Ocean two [[Grammy Award]] nominations, and won the [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] at the [[27th Annual Grammy Awards|1985 Grammy Awards]]. Ocean was later presented his award by [[Shalamar]] group member [[Jeffrey Daniel]] on ''620 Soul Train'', a UK incarnation of the American music dance show ''[[Soul Train]]''. The album's [[Suddenly (Billy Ocean song)|title track]] also became a success, peaking at No. 4 in both the US and the UK and the song "[[Loverboy (Billy Ocean song)|Loverboy]]", while also being a No. 2 US success in 1985 was also featured in the first scene of the popular UK [[BBC One]] TV series ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', in 1986. Ocean appeared at [[Live Aid]] in 1985, singing "Caribbean Queen" and "Loverboy", from [[John F. Kennedy Stadium (Philadelphia)|JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]].

His 1986 album ''[[Love Zone]]'' also sold well. It included the successful singles "[[When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going (song)|When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going]]", the theme from the film ''[[The Jewel of the Nile]];'' this was a No. 1 success in the UK and a No. 2 in the United States; and "[[There'll Be Sad Songs (To Make You Cry)]]" (a US No. 1, and also a major UK success). Also included were the title track and "Love Is Forever", which were No. 10 and No. 16 US successes for Ocean, respectively. It also earned Ocean a second nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Male R&B Vocal Performance|Best Male R&B Vocal Performance]] at the [[29th Annual Grammy Awards|1987 Grammy Awards]].

In February 1986, Ocean's [[music video|video]] of "When the Going Gets Tough, the Tough Get Going" was banned by the [[BBC]], owing to such non-[[Trade union|union]] members as the American actors [[Michael Douglas]], [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Danny DeVito]], all three of whom were cast members of ''[[Romancing the Stone]]'' and ''The Jewel of the Nile'', [[Lip sync|miming]] to the backing vocals.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book| first= John| last= Tobler| year= 1992| title= NME Rock 'N' Roll Years| edition= 1st| publisher=Reed International Books Ltd| location= London| page= 415| id= CN 5585}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b048wwlk|title = BBC Four - Britain's Most Dangerous Songs: Listen to the Banned|website=Bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cherryred.co.uk/product/love-zone-expanded-edition/|title=Billy Ocean: Love Zone, Expanded Edition|website=Cherryred.co.uk}}</ref> At the 1987 [[Brit Awards]], Ocean was nominated for the Brit Award for Best British Male.<ref name="BRITS"/>
