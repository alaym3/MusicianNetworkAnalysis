'''Gollum''' is a fictional [[Tolkien's monsters|monstrous character]] from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s [[Middle-earth]] [[legendarium]]. He was introduced in the 1937 [[Fantasy (genre)|fantasy]] novel ''[[The Hobbit]]'', and became important in its sequel, ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. Gollum was a [[Hobbit#Types|Stoor Hobbit]]<ref group=T>''[[Unfinished Tales]]'', Part Three, IV. "The Hunt for the Ring", p 353, note 9.</ref><ref name="Letter 214" group=T>''[[Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien|Letters]]'', #214 to A. C. Nunn, c. late 1958-early 1959 "remigration of the Stoors ... Deagol-Smeagol incident"</ref> of the River-folk who lived near the [[Gladden Fields]]. In ''The Lord of the Rings'' it is stated that he was originally known as '''Sméagol''', he was corrupted by the [[One Ring]] and later named Gollum after his habit of making "a horrible swallowing noise in his throat".<ref name="Riddles in the Dark" group=T/>

Sméagol obtained the Ring by murdering his relative Déagol, who found it in the [[River Anduin]]. Gollum referred to the Ring as "my precious" or "precious", and it extended his life far beyond natural limits. Centuries of the Ring's influence twisted Gollum's body and mind, and, by the time of the novels, he "loved and hated [the Ring], as he loved and hated himself."<ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T/> Throughout the story, Gollum was torn between his lust for the Ring and his desire to be free of it. [[Bilbo Baggins]] found the Ring and took it for his own, and Gollum afterwards pursued it for the rest of his life. Gollum finally seized the Ring from [[Frodo Baggins]] at the Cracks of Doom in [[Mount Doom]] in [[Mordor]], but he fell into the fires of the volcano, where both he and the Ring were destroyed.

Commentators have described Gollum as a psychological [[Shadow (Jung)|shadow figure]] for Frodo and as an evil guide in contrast to the [[Istari|wizard]] [[Gandalf]], the good guide. They have noted, too, that Gollum is not wholly evil, and that he has a part to play in the will of [[Eru Iluvatar|the omnipotent god of Middle-earth]], necessary to the destruction of the Ring. For Gollum's literary origins, scholars have compared Gollum to the shrivelled hag Gagool in [[Rider Haggard]]'s 1885 novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' and to the subterranean [[Morlocks]] in [[H. G. Wells]]' 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]''.

Gollum was voiced by [[Brother Theodore]] in [[Rankin-Bass]]' animated adaptations of ''[[The Hobbit (1977 film)|The Hobbit]]'' and ''[[The Return of the King (1980 film)|Return of the King]]'', and by [[Peter Woodthorpe]] in [[Ralph Bakshi]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)|animated film version]] and the [[BBC]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (1981 radio series)|1981 radio adaptation of ''The Lord of the Rings'']]. He was portrayed through [[motion capture]] by [[Andy Serkis]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'']] and [[The Hobbit film trilogy|''The Hobbit'']] film trilogies.

==Name==

In Appendix F of ''The Lord of the Rings'', the name "Sméagol" is said to be a "translation" of the [[Middle-earth]] name {{lang|art|Trahald}} (having to do with the idea of "burrowing", and rendered with a name based on {{lang-ang|smygel}} of similar meaning).<ref>See definition: {{Cite web |first1=Joseph |last1=Bosworth | author-link=Joseph Bosworth |first2=T. |last2=Northcote Toller |url=http://www.bosworthtoller.com/028184 |title=smygel |work=[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]] (Online) | publisher=[[Charles University]] |location=Prague}} – a derivation of the verb ''smúgan'', which is the basis for the name of [[Smaug]], the dragon</ref> 

The rhyming name of his relative "Déagol" is from {{lang-ang|dēagol}}, meaning "secretive, hidden".<ref>Bosworth, J., & Toller, T. Northcote. (1898). ''[[An Anglo-Saxon Dictionary]]''. Oxford: Clarendon Press, s.v. [http://www.bosworthtoller.com/007595 "deogol"].</ref> In Tolkien's ''[[Red Book of Westmarch]]'', the name "Déagol" is supposedly a translation of the "original" name in the author-invented language of [[Westron]], {{lang|art|Nahald}}, with the same meaning.<ref name="ntc">{{cite book |last=Tyler |first=J.

===''The Hobbit''===

Gollum was introduced in ''[[The Hobbit]]'' as "a small, slimy creature" who lived on a small island in an underground lake at the roots of the [[Misty Mountains]]. He survived on cave fish, which he caught from a small boat, and small [[Orc (Middle-earth)|goblins]] who strayed too far from the [[Goblin Town|stronghold of the Great Goblin]]. Over the years, his eyes adapted to the dark and became "lamp-like", shining with a sickly pale light.<ref name="Riddles in the Dark" group=T/>

[[Bilbo Baggins]] stumbled upon Gollum's lair, having found [[One Ring|the Ring]] in the network of goblin tunnels leading down to the lake. At his wits' end in the dark, Bilbo agreed to a [[Riddle|riddle game]] with Gollum on the chance of being shown the way out of the mountains.<ref name="Riddles in the Dark" group=T/> In the first edition of ''The Hobbit'', Gollum's size is not stated.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Scoville |first=Chester N. |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D. C. |editor-link=Michael D. C. Drout |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B0loOBA3ejIC&pg=PA278 |title=Hobbit, The |encyclopedia=[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]] |chapter=Scholarship and Critical Assessment |publisher=[[Taylor & Francis]] |date=2007 |isbn=978-0415969420 |page=278}}</ref> Originally, he was also characterised as being less bound to the Ring than in later versions; he offered to give the Ring to Bilbo if he lost the riddle game, and he showed Bilbo the way out of the mountains after losing. To fit the concept of the ruling Ring that emerged during the writing of ''The Lord of the Rings'', Tolkien revised later editions of ''The Hobbit''. The version of the story given in the first edition became the lie that Bilbo made up to justify his possession of the Ring to the [[Dwarf (Middle-earth)|Dwarves]] and [[Gandalf]]. In the new version, Gollum pretended that he would show Bilbo the way out if he lost the riddle-game, but he actually planned to use the Ring to kill and eat the hobbit. Discovering the Ring missing, he suddenly realised the answer to Bilbo's last riddle—"What have I got in my pocket?" (a question at first not meant as a riddle, but as a self-asked one)—and flew into a rage. Bilbo inadvertently discovered the Ring's power of invisibility as he fled, allowing him to follow Gollum undetected to a back entrance of the caves. Gollum was convinced that Bilbo knew the way out all along, and hoped to intercept him near the entrance, lest the goblins apprehend Bilbo and find the Ring. Bilbo at first thought to kill Gollum in order to escape, but was overcome with pity, and so merely leaped over him. As Bilbo escaped, Gollum cried out, "Thief, Thief, Thief! Baggins! We hates it, we hates it, we hates it forever!"<ref name="Riddles in the Dark" group=T/>

===''The Lord of the Rings''===

Gollum's real name was Sméagol, and he had once been a member of the secluded branch of the early Stoorish [[Hobbit]]s. He spent the early years of his life with his extended family under a [[matriarch]], his grandmother. On Sméagol's birthday, he and his relative Déagol went fishing in the [[Gladden Fields]]. There, Déagol found the Ring in the riverbed after being pulled into the water by a fish. Sméagol fell immediately under the Ring's influence and demanded it as a birthday present; when Déagol refused, Sméagol strangled him.<ref name="Letter 214" group=T/><ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 1, ch. 2 "[[The Shadow of the Past]]"</ref>

Sméagol later used the Ring for thieving, spying and antagonising his friends and relatives, who nicknamed him "Gollum" for the swallowing noise he made in his throat, until his grandmother disowned him. He wandered in the wilderness for a few years until he finally retreated to a deep cavern in the [[Misty Mountains]]. The Ring's malignant influence twisted his body and mind, and prolonged his life well beyond its natural limits.<ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T/>

Gollum left his cave in pursuit of Bilbo a few years after losing the Ring, but the trail was cold. He made his way to the edge of [[Mordor]], where he met the monstrous spider [[Shelob]] and became her spy, worshipping her and bringing her food. He was eventually captured by Sauron's forces and tortured, revealing to Sauron the names of "Baggins" and "the [[Shire (Middle-earth)|Shire]]". His testimony alerted Sauron to the existence and significance of hobbits in general and the Baggins family in particular. He was freed, but was soon caught by [[Gandalf]] and [[Aragorn]], who interrogated him about the Ring and placed him in the care of the [[Silvan Elves|Wood Elves]] of [[Mirkwood]]. He escaped them (with the help of Sauron's [[Orc (Middle-earth)|Orcs]]) and descended into [[Moria (Middle-earth)|Moria]].<ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T/>

Gollum began following the [[Fellowship of the Ring (characters)|Fellowship of the Ring]] in Moria, but was noticed by [[Frodo Baggins]], Gandalf, and Aragorn. He trailed the Fellowship to the edge of [[Lothlórien]]. He picked up their trail again as they left,<ref group=T>''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', book 2, ch. 9 "The Great River"</ref> following them all the way to [[Rauros]], then pursued Frodo and [[Samwise Gamgee]] across the [[Emyn Muil]] when they struck out on their own towards Mordor.<ref name="The Taming of Sméagol" group=T/>

Frodo and Sam confronted Gollum in the Emyn Muil; Gollum nearly strangled Sam, but Frodo subdued him with his Elvish sword, [[Sting (Middle-earth)|Sting]], which had once belonged to [[Bilbo Baggins|Bilbo]]. Frodo tied an Elvish rope around Gollum's ankle as a leash, but the mere touch of the rope pained him. Taking pity on the wretched creature, just as Bilbo once had, Frodo made Gollum swear to help them. Agreeing to the oath, Gollum swore by the Ring itself, and Frodo released him.<ref name="The Taming of Sméagol" group=T/> The unlikely company, guided by Gollum, made their way to the [[Morannon|Black Gate]], the main entrance to Mordor. Frodo's kindness brought out Gollum's better nature, and he made at least some effort to keep his promise. Sam, however, despised Gollum upon sight, and often warned Frodo of the creature's deception and slipperiness.<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 3, "The Black Gate is Closed"</ref>  

When they reached the Black Gate and found it well-guarded, Gollum offered to lead them toward an alternate entrance into Mordor. Along the way, Frodo and Sam were seized by [[Faramir]], and Gollum slipped away uncaught (but not unseen) and followed them.<ref name="Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit" group=T/> When Frodo allowed Faramir to briefly take Gollum prisoner in order to spare his life, Gollum felt betrayed, and began plotting against his new "master". Faramir found out that Gollum was taking them to the pass of [[Cirith Ungol]], an entrance to Mordor through the [[Ephel Dúath]] mountains. He warned Frodo and Sam of the evil of that place, as well as the treachery he sensed in Gollum.<ref name="The Forbidden Pool" group=T/>

Frodo, Sam, and Gollum left Faramir and climbed the stairs to Cirith Ungol. Gollum slipped away and visited Shelob, planning to feed the hobbits to her and then get the Ring for himself when she was done. When he returned, he found the hobbits asleep, and the sight of Frodo sleeping nearly moved Gollum to repent. However, Sam woke up and spoke harshly to him, and the opportunity for redemption was lost.<ref group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 8, "The Stairs of Cirith Ungol"</ref>  

Gollum followed through with his plan and led Frodo and Sam into [[Shelob's Lair]]. There, Frodo was stung by Shelob, taken prisoner by Orcs, and hauled to the Tower of Cirith Ungol.<ref name="Shelob's Lair" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 9, "Shelob's Lair"</ref> Sam rescued Frodo from the [[Tower of Cirith Ungol]] and, dressed in scavenged [[Middle-earth weapons and armour|Orc-armour]], the two made their way across the [[Gorgoroth (Middle-earth)|plateau of Gorgoroth]] to [[Mount Doom]]. When Frodo and Sam had almost reached their destination, Gollum attacked them, but Frodo threw him down. Sam faced Gollum on his own, letting Frodo continue up the mountain to finish their mission. Like Bilbo and Frodo before him, Sam spared Gollum's life, turned his back on the creature, and followed Frodo.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 3, "Mount Doom"</ref> 

Moments later, Frodo stood on the edge of the Crack of Doom, but claimed the Ring for himself and put it on. Gollum struck, struggled with the invisible Frodo, bit off Frodo's finger, and seized the Ring. Gloating over his "prize" and dancing madly, he stepped over the edge and fell into the Crack of Doom, taking the Ring with him with a last cry of "Precious!" Thus, the Ring was destroyed and Sauron defeated. Sam cursed Gollum after his death, but Frodo urged his friend to forgive him, as without him the quest would have failed.<ref group=T>''[[The Return of the King]]'', book 6, ch. 4, "The Field of Cormallen"</ref>

===Personality===
[[File:Gollum s journey commences by Frederic Bennett (detail).jpg|thumb|Gollum by Frederic Bennet, 2014 (detail)]]

Tolkien describes Gollum's personality after he had been captured by Frodo and Sam:<ref name="The Taming of Sméagol" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 1 "The Taming of Sméagol"</ref>

{{quote|text=For that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him.<ref name="The Taming of Sméagol" group=T/>}}

Gollum hates everything [[Elf (Middle-earth)|Elf]]-made. In ''[[The Two Towers]]'', Sam bound Gollum's neck with Elven rope, which caused Gollum excruciating pain by its mere presence.<ref name="The Taming of Sméagol" group=T/> He was unable or unwilling to eat the ''lembas'' bread Sam and Frodo carried with them, and rejects cooked rabbit in favour of raw meat or fish.<ref name="Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 4, "Of Herbs and Stewed Rabbit"</ref><ref name="The Forbidden Pool" group=T>''[[The Two Towers]]'', book 4, ch. 6, "The Forbidden Pool"</ref>

===Speech===

Gollum speaks in an idiosyncratic manner, often [[illeism|referring to himself in the third person]], and frequently talks to himself. In ''The Hobbit'', he always refers to himself as "my precious".<ref name="Riddles in the Dark" group=T>''[[The Hobbit]]'', ch. 5 "Riddles in the Dark"</ref> When not referring to himself in third person, he sometimes speaks of himself in the plural as "we", hinting at his alter ego. The rare occasions when he actually says "I" are interpreted by Frodo as an indication that Sméagol's better self has the upper hand. Gollum also uses his own versions of words similar to the original words. He usually [[Reduplicated plural|adds -es to the end of a plural]], resulting in words such as "hobbitses" instead of hobbits or "birdses" instead of birds. When forming the present tense of verbs, he frequently extends the third person singular ending -s to other persons and numbers, resulting in constructions like "we ''hates'' it" (by analogy with "he hates it"). Gollum's speech emphasises [[sibilant]]s, often drawing them out.<ref group=T>''[[Return of the King]]'', Appendix F: II, "On Translation"</ref>

===Age===

Through the influence of the Ring, Gollum's life was extended far beyond that of other members of his clan. An average hobbit lifespan is over 100 years, but a span of 556 years separates Gollum's finding of the Ring and its destruction, by which time he was almost 600 years old.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glyphweb.com/arda/s/smeagol.html|title=Sméagol |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Arda |access-date=25 March 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024091258/http://www.glyphweb.com/ARDA/s/smeagol.html |archive-date=24 October 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Cain is jealous of his brother Abel; Sméagol is jealous of the shiny gold ring that his friend Déagol has found. Nelson observes that the names of the friends are similar, hinting that at least figuratively they are "brothers". Cain is guilty of Abel's murder, and ends up as a restless wanderer, never finding peace; Sméagol likewise is exiled from his Hobbit-people, and "wandered in loneliness".<ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T/> Nelson notes that Tolkien was a famed scholar of the [[Old English]] poem ''[[Beowulf]]'', which he acknowledged was a major source of his own fiction;<ref group=T>{{cite book |last=Tolkien |first=J.

The Tolkien scholar [[Verlyn Flieger]] suggests that Gollum is [[Tolkien's monsters|Tolkien's central monster]]-figure, likening him to both Grendel and [[the Beowulf Dragon|the ''Beowulf'' dragon]], "the twisted, broken, outcast hobbit whose manlike shape and dragonlike greed combine both the ''Beowulf'' kinds of monster in one figure".<ref name="Flieger 2004">{{cite book |last=Flieger |first=Verlyn |author-link=Verlyn Flieger |editor1=[[Rose A.

Illustration by [[Arthur Rackham]], 1911]]

Jamie McGregor, writing in ''[[Mythlore]]'', compares Sméagol's murder of Déagol to [[Fafnir#In Wagner|Fafner]]'s murder of his brother [[Fasolt]] in [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]''. He notes that Tolkien denied any comparison of his Ring with Wagner's, and that this was accepted by his biographer [[Humphrey Carpenter]].<ref name="McGregor 2011">{{cite journal |last=McGregor |first=Jamie |year=2011 |title=Two Rings to Rule Them All: A Comparative Study of Tolkien and Wagner |journal=[[Mythlore]] |volume=29 |issue=3/4 Spring/Summer |pages=133–153, Article 10 |url=https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol29/iss3/10}}</ref> All the same, McGregor notes that Arthur Morgan identified evident parallels, starting with [[Alberich]]'s curse: there is only one ring; it is cursed; it gives limitless power; owning it brings only misery, and it consumes its owner, who becomes its slave; its owner is called the Lord; owning it is living death.<ref name="Morgan 1992">{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Arthur |chapter=Medieval, Victorian and Modern: Tolkien, Wagner and The Ring |editor-last=Gray |editor-first=Rosemary |title=A Tribute to J. R. R. Tolkien |date=1992 |publisher=[[UNISA]] Medieval Association |location=Pretoria |pages=16–28}}</ref> 

McGregor further compares Déagol's delight in the ring with the [[Rhinemaidens]]' innocent rejoicing in their gold: "And behold! when he washed the mud away, there in his hand lay a beautiful golden ring; and it shone and glittered in the sun, so that his heart was glad".<ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T/> He draws a parallel between Sméagol's asking for the Ring with Fafner's; Déagol refuses, saying "I'm going to keep it", just as Fasolt says "I hold it: it belongs to me"; Sméagol derisively says "Oh, are you indeed, my love", and throttles him, turning by degrees into the Ring-depraved Gollum-monster, while Fafner sourly says "Hold it fast in case it falls" and clubs Fasolt to death, becoming by degrees a treasure-fixated dragon.<ref name="McGregor 2011"/><ref name="Shadow of the Past" group=T/> 

Much later, Bilbo blunders into Gollum's cave and finds the Ring by accident; he holds off Gollum with his sword, and escapes by winning a peaceful battle, a riddle contest; [[Sigurd|Siegfried]] is led by Mime to the dragon's den, kills Fafner to save himself from being eaten; and takes the ring as a bird's voice suggests it. Alberich had cursed the "thief" who took the ring; Gollum curses Bilbo for taking his Ring. On the other hand, McGregor writes, Siegfried is a hero, Bilbo, an anti-hero; and the shrunken [[Regin|Mime]] is the most Gollum-like character in Wagner's Ring Cycle.<ref name="McGregor 2011"/><ref name="Riddles in the Dark" group=T/>

===Psychological "pairing" with Frodo===
{{further|Reception of J. R. R. Tolkien#Jungian archetypes}}

A variety of commentators have suggested that Gollum constitutes a "[[Shadow (Jung)|shadow figure]]" for Frodo, as his dark ''[[alter ego]]'' ("other self") according to [[Carl Jung]]'s theory of psychological [[individuation]]. Some have identified many such "pairings", such as [[Denethor]] as a shadow for [[Théoden]], [[Boromir]] for [[Aragorn]], [[Saruman]] for [[Gandalf]], [[Ted Sandyman]] for Sam Gamgee, the [[Barrow-wight]] for [[Tom Bombadil]], and Shelob for [[Galadriel]], but the Gollum/Frodo pairing is by far the most widely accepted.<ref name="VV.2019">{{cite book |last=Honegger |first=Thomas |title=More Light than Shadow? |work=Tolkien: Light and Shadow |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bGCzDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT152 |year=2019 |publisher=Kipple Officina Libraria |isbn=978-88-321-7907-1 |pages=151–154}}</ref>

===Evil guide===

The Tolkien scholar Charles W. Nelson described Gollum as an evil guide, contrasted with Gandalf, the good guide (like [[Virgil]] in [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'') in ''Lord of the Rings''. He notes, too, that both Gollum and Gandalf are servants of The One, [[Eru Ilúvatar]], in the struggle against the forces of darkness, and "ironically" all of them, good and bad, are necessary to the success of the quest.<ref name="Nelson 2002">{{cite journal |last=Nelson |first=Charles W. |title=From Gollum to Gandalf: The Guide Figures in J.

===Playing a part in a cosmic game===
{{further||Christianity in Middle-earth#Moral conflict}}

David Callaway, writing in ''[[Mythlore]]'', notes that Tolkien, a devout [[Roman Catholic]], had made [[Middle-earth]] a place where good and evil are in conflict under an omnipotent god, Eru Ilúvatar: in other words, "his cosmology is Christian".<ref name="Callaway 1984">{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=David |date=1984 |title=Gollum: A Misunderstood Hero |journal=[[Mythlore]] |volume=10 |issue=3 |location=article 4 |url=https://dc.swosu.edu/mythlore/vol10/iss3/4}}</ref> Callaway describes Gollum as fitting into this framework as a being not wholly evil, able to make moral choices.<ref name="Callaway 1984"/> 

The [[Episcopalianism|Episcopal]] priest [[Fleming Rutledge]] writes that at the Council of Elrond, Frodo angrily resists the notion that Gollum was a Hobbit like himself, but that Gandalf describes the tale of Gollum's enslavement to the Ring as "a sad story" rather than as Frodo's description of him, "loathsome". Gandalf says that Gollum "had no [[Free will in theology|will]] left in the matter", and could not get rid of the Ring; instead, "the Ring itself .. decided things".<ref name="Council of Elrond" group=T/> Rutledge comments that the sad story has happened to everybody, trapped, as Christians believe, in "Sin and Death", and states that<ref name="Rutledge 2004">{{cite book |last=Rutledge |first=Fleming |author-link=Fleming Rutledge |title=The Battle for Middle-earth: Tolkien's Divine Design in The Lord of the Rings |year=2004 |publisher=[[William B.

Eru makes use of every being's choices for good: Callaway gives as example the way that [[Wormtongue]]'s angry throwing of the ''[[palantír]]'', a crystal ball-like stone of seeing, enables [[Pippin Took|Pippin]] to look in the stone and reveal himself to [[Sauron]]; in turn, Sauron jumps to a wrong conclusion about the stone and the hobbit, which assists the Fellowship in completing their quest, destroying the One Ring. Similarly, Callaway argues, Gollum "is being partly manipulated by Eru in this cosmic chess game"<ref name="Callaway 1984"/> citing Gandalf's remark that Gollum "has some part to play yet, for good or ill".<!--The Two Towers--><ref name="Callaway 1984"/> And indeed, Gollum's ''[[alter ego]]'', Sméagol, struggles to be good, speaks the truth when questioned by Frodo, and guides them through the [[Dead Marshes]]. In short, as Tolkien writes, Gollum is "not altogether wicked".<!--Return of the King--><ref name="Callaway 1984"/> Finally, at the end of the quest inside Mount Doom, Gollum takes the Ring from Frodo, and causes it to be destroyed, completing the quest successfully at the moment that Frodo had announced that he would keep the Ring. Callaway calls this "the ultimate heroic self-sacrifice", arguing that Gollum acted "consciously" using "the good fraction in his mind finally overpowering the Ring's evil".<ref name="Callaway 1984"/>

The scholars of English literature William N. Rogers II and Michael R. Underwood compare Gollum to the similarly named<ref name="Rogers 2000"/> evil and ancient hag Gagool in [[H. Rider Haggard|Rider Haggard's]] 1885 novel ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]''; Tolkien acknowledged Haggard, especially his novel ''[[She (novel)|She]]'', as a major influence. They note that Haggard's tales share many motifs with Tolkien's ''The Hobbit'', including a non-heroic narrator who turns out to be brave and capable in a crisis; a group of male characters on a quest; dangers in caves; a goal of treasure; and return to a happy countryside. Along with that, the two characters both have a monstrous character. Gagool is described as seeming to be<ref name="Rogers 2000">{{cite book |last1=Rogers |first1=William N., II |last2=Underwood |first2=Michael R. |editor=Sir George Clark |title=Gagool and Gollum: Exemplars of Degeneration in ''King Solomon's Mines'' and ''The Hobbit'' |work=J.R.R.

As for the skull itself, it was perfectly bare, and yellow in hue, while its wrinkled scalp moved and contracted like the hood of a [[cobra]]." —''King Solomon's Mines'', 1885<ref name="Rogers 2000"/>}}

They note that Gagool speaks of and rejoices in "blood and death".<ref name="Rogers 2000"/> Like Gollum, she is human-like but distorted to a parody; she is shrunken and extremely old; her large eyes and speech are distinctive; and she is wholly materialistic, with a "terrible greediness and self-referencing" and "the insatiable claims of the naked ego".<ref name="Rogers 2000"/> They mention also the cultural background of the late 19th century, combining [[economic recession]], fear of moral decline and degeneration leading indeed to [[eugenics]], and a "for-the-moment [[hedonism]]" in the face of these concerns. They comment that Gagool can be seen as a "worst-case" embodiment of such [[Victorian era]] fears.<ref name="Rogers 2000"/>

Dale Nelson, writing in the ''[[J.R.R. Tolkien Encyclopedia]]'', suggests that Gollum may derive from [[H. G. Wells]]'s [[Morlocks]] in his 1895 novel ''[[The Time Machine]]''. They have "dull white" skin with a "bleached look", "strange large grayish-red eyes" with "a capacity for reflecting light", and run in a low posture somewhere close to all fours, looking like "a human spider", through having lived for generations underground in darkness.<ref name="Nelson 2013">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Nelson |first=Dale |editor-last=Drout |editor-first=Michael D.

[[File:Gollum.PNG|thumb|upright|Gollum was voiced and performed by [[Andy Serkis]] in [[Peter Jackson]]'s live-action version of ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''.]]

In [[Peter Jackson]]'s [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''The Lord of the Rings'' film trilogy]], Gollum is a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] character voiced and performed by actor [[Andy Serkis]]. He is smaller than both Frodo and Sam, but still has considerable strength and agility. Barely glimpsed in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'' (2001), he becomes a central character in ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]'' (2003). The CGI character was built around Serkis's facial features, voice, and acting choices, and is depicted naked but for a loincloth. Serkis based the iconic "''gollum''" throat noise on the sound of his cat coughing up hairballs.<ref>{{cite book |first=Andy |last=Serkis |author-link=Andy Serkis |title=Gollum: How We Made Movie Magic |publisher=[[Harper Collins]] |location=London |date=2003 |page=[https://archive.org/details/lordofringsg00serk/page/4 4]|isbn=0-618-39104-5}}</ref> Using a digital puppet created by [[Jason Schleifer]] and [[Bay Raitt]] at [[Weta Digital]], animators created Gollum's performance using a mixture of [[motion capture]] data recorded from Serkis and the traditional animation process of [[key frame]], along with the laborious process of digitally [[rotoscoping]] Serkis's image and replacing it with the digital Gollum's in a technique coined ''rotoanimation''.<ref name="rotoanimation">{{cite video |title=The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers – Special Extended DVD Edition, The Appendices Part Three: The Journey Continues |medium=DVD |publisher=[[New Line Cinema]] |date=2002}}</ref> 

In ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'', Serkis himself appears in a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] scene as Sméagol before his degeneration into Gollum. This scene was originally earmarked for ''The Two Towers'', but was held back because the screenwriters felt audiences would relate better to the original Sméagol once they were more familiar with who he became. The decision to include this scene meant that Raitt and Jamie Beswarick had to redesign Gollum's face for the second and third films so that it would more closely resemble Serkis'.<ref name="Lewis2012">{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Justin |title=Andy Serkis - The Man Behind the Mask |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9TatDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT110 |year=2012 |publisher=John Blake |isbn=978-1-78219-089-9 |page=110}}</ref> Serkis once again played Gollum in the 2012 prequel film ''[[The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Truitt |first=Brian |title=Andy Serkis plays dual roles for 'The Hobbit' |url=https://eu.usatoday.com/story/life/movies/2013/03/18/andy-serkis-the-hobbit-blu-ray-dvd/1997783/ |publisher=USA Today |access-date=20 April 2020 |date=18 March 2013}}</ref> In Jackson's films, Gollum has a split personality: the childlike "Sméagol" and the evil "Gollum".

This style was praised by the Tolkien scholar [[Tom Shippey]] who described the Jackson interpretation as "masterful" and the additional scenes as "especially good".<ref name="Shippey 2005 p422">{{cite book |last=Shippey |first=Tom |author-link=Tom Shippey |title=The Road to Middle-Earth |date=2005 |edition=Third |orig-year=1982 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0261102750 |page=422}}</ref>
