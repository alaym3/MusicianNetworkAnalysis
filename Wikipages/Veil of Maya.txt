==History==

===Formation and demo (2004–2006)===
Veil of Maya formed in 2004 in Chicago, Illinois after [[melodic death metal]] band Insurrection broke up, which led members Marc (lead guitar), Sam (drums) and Kris (bassist) to start up the new project.<ref>{{cite web|last=Chopik|first=Ivan|title=Marc Okubo Interview  - Veil Of Maya (2012)|url=http://www.guitarmessenger.com/interviews/marc-okubo-interview-veil-of-maya-2012/|publisher=Guitar Messenger|access-date=4 April 2012}}</ref> Guitarist Timothy Marshall and vocalist Adam joined shortly thereafter.

After recording a  self-released demo in 2005, guitarist Scott Okarma briefly joined the group, participating in local shows and early touring. At this point, Veil of Maya were a six-piece band with three guitarists, but this only lasted for a few months before both Marshall and Okarma left the band. Bryan Ruppell replaced them both on rhythm guitar thus reverting their lineup back to five members.

===''All Things Set Aside'' and ''The Common Man's Collapse'' (2006–2009)===
With this five member line-up, the band recorded, self-produced and released their debut full-length album ''[[All Things Set Aside]]'' through Corrosive Recordings in 2006. In early 2006 vocalist Clemans and guitarist Ruppell left the group leading Veil of Maya to enlist the help of then 20-year-old Brandon Butler, former vocalist of the Indiana metal band Iscariot. The band also decided not to search for a new rhythm guitarist, thus leaving Veil of Maya as a four-piece.

In January 2008, after heightened exposure from interviews and successful tours, Veil of Maya signed with [[Sumerian Records]].<ref name=bio>{{cite magazine|title=Veil of Maya: Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277757/veil-maya/biography|magazine=Billboard|access-date=11 February 2015|date=2015}}</ref>  Sumerian manager Shawn Keith and founder Ash Avildsen were both reportedly very ecstatic about the partnership. Veil of Maya's second album, ''[[The Common Man's Collapse]]'' was recorded with Butler in 2008 and released the same year. Shortly after the album release, the band parted ways their original bassist Kristopher "Kris" Higler in 2009, and was replaced by Matthew Pantelis, formerly of Born of Osiris.

===''[id]'' and ''Eclipse'' (2010–2012)===
After their second album's release, the following several months held extensive touring before the writing and recording for the group's third full-length, ''[[id (Veil of Maya album)|[id]]]'' began. ''[id]'' was released on April 6, 2010, and reached number 107 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name=billboard>{{cite magazine|title=Veil of Maya: Chart History|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/277757/veil-maya/chart|magazine=Billboard|access-date=11 February 2015|date=2015}}</ref> The band worked again with producer Michael Keene from [[The Faceless]] for this album, who previously produced ''The Common Man's Collapse''. The album's name was derived from the main character of the PlayStation game ''[[Xenogears]]'';{{Citation needed| date=January 2013}} the album itself also holds several concepts and references to other topics in popular culture, especially television shows.<ref>{{cite news|title=VEIL OF MAYA New Song based on LOST|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/tv/view/4124/veil-of-maya-new-song-based-on-lost|work=Metal Injection|access-date=23 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315014406/http://www.metalinjection.net/tv/view/4124/veil-of-maya-new-song-based-on-lost|archive-date=15 March 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=A METALSUCKS WORLD PREMIERE: VEIL OF MAYA’S "NAMASTE"|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2010/02/12/a-metalsucks-world-premiere-veil-of-mayas-namaste/|publisher=[[MetalSucks]]|access-date=25 March 2012}}</ref>

After the release of ''[id]'', Pantelis as well left the band, which led to Danny Hauser replacing him in 2010; the band's current bassist. On January 13, 2012, Sumerian Records released a teaser for Veil of Maya's next album, ''[[Eclipse (Veil of Maya album)|Eclipse]]''. On January 17, the single "Vicious Circles" was released onto the [[iTunes Store]]. ''Eclipse'' was then released on February 28, 2012<ref>[http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=75951] {{dead link|date=October 2020}}</ref> and was produced and co-written by [[Periphery (band)|Periphery]] guitarist [[Misha Mansoor]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.heavyblogisheavy.com/2012/02/23/veil-of-maya-eclipse/|title=Veil of Maya – Eclipse – Heavy Blog Is Heavy|website=Heavyblogisheavy.com|access-date=10 October 2020}}</ref>

On November 11, 2013 the band released a digital-only single, ''Subject Zero'', with a lyric video uploaded on YouTube two weeks earlier, on September 30, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2013/10/31/veil-maya-study-subject-zero/|title=Veil of Maya Study &quot;Subject Zero&quot; - MetalSucks|author=Axl Rosenberg|date=October 31, 2013|access-date=May 14, 2015}}</ref>

===Recording of new album and Butler's departure (2013–2014)===
Veil of Maya announced in 2014 that they had finished writing the follow-up to ''Eclipse'' and were recording with [[Taylor Larson]]. However, progress was stopped as long-time vocalist Brandon Butler left the band, citing creative differences with his bandmates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://propertyofzack.com/post/98489624268/veil-of-maya-part-ways-with-vocalist-brandon-butler|title=Veil Of Maya Part Ways With Vocalist Brandon Butler|access-date=14 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Loudwire]]|last=Childers|first=Chad|url=http://loudwire.com/veil-of-maya-brandon-butler-creative-differences-split/|title=Ex-Veil of Maya Frontman Brandon Butler Comments on Split|date=September 29, 2014|access-date=September 29, 2014}}</ref> Butler moved on to join a band named Lost Origins, which features former members of [[I Declare War (band)|I Declare War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2015/02/23/news/ex-veil-of-maya-frontman-brandon-butler-joins-lost-origins-ex-i-declare-war/|title=Ex-Veil Of Maya Frontman Brandon Butler Joins Lost Origins (Ex-I Declare War)|publisher=The PRP|date=February 23, 2015|access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref>

===Magyar's arrival and ''Matriarch'' (2014–2016)===
At Knotfest 2014, Veil of Maya were seen performing with a new vocalist, who is well known in the local music scene of the state of Wisconsin, on January 1, 2015 it was announced that Arms of Empire vocalist Lukas Magyar joined the band replacing the departed Butler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalhammer.teamrock.com/news/2015-01-03/veil-of-maya-recruit-arms-of-empire-singer|title=Veil of Maya recruit Arms Of Empire singer|work=Metal Hammer|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> At the same time, the band released a new single, "Phoenix".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/veil-of-maya-new-vocalist-song-phoenix/|title=Veil of Maya Announce New Vocalist + Unleash New Song|work=Loudwire|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref>

Shortly after the announcement, the band headed out on the "Slow Your Troll and Know Your Role" tour with Upon a Burning Body, Volumes, Gideon and The Last Ten Seconds of Life. They also took part in the Ashes to Ashes European Tour with [[Chelsea Grin]], [[Oceans Ate Alaska]] and Black Tongue (Black Tongue pulled out within the first few shows due to an injury sustained by frontman Alex Teyen).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalinjection.net/ouch/black-tongue-vocalist-fell-from-moving-tour-bus-after-mistaking-exit-for-a-bathroom|title=BLACK TONGUE Vocalist Fell From Moving Tour Bus After Mistaking Exit For A Bathroom|work=Metal Injection|access-date=17 May 2015}}</ref>

On March 23, 2015, Veil of Maya officially announced the release of a new album, ''Matriarch'', and released a new single, "Mikasa". The album was released on May 12, 2015 through Sumerian Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=Veil has Risen|url=http://www.veilhasrisen.com/|website=veilhasrisen.com|publisher=Sumerian Records|access-date=23 March 2015}}</ref> It is the band's first release with Magyar, and represents somewhat of a departure from the style of the band's previous releases: it is less focused on technicality and is their first work to incorporate clean singing and replaces [[death growl|growling]] with hardcore-style [[screaming (music)|screaming]].

===''False Idol'' (2017–present)===
On September 13, 2017, the band released a music video "Overthrow" on YouTube, and announced the album ''False Idol'' for October 20, 2017.
