== Early life ==
At the age of 8, Christensen went for piano lessons which he had disliked.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.theuntz.com/news/the-trifecta-crywolf-illenium-and-said-the-sky-at-the-untz-festival/|title=The trifecta: Crywolf, Illenium and Said The Sky at The Untz Festival|last=Rutherford|first=Kyle|date=26 May 2016|newspaper=The Untz|access-date=2016-11-20}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> He quit the lessons after several years but later rejoined it while he was in middle school, along picking up other instruments to learn.<ref name=":0" /> He first got into [[electronic dance music]] by learning about the [[Music production (music industry)|production]] at a Digital Audio Production class in high school.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2014/12/16/your-edm-interview-get-to-know-colorados-said-the-sky-before-everyone-else-does/|title=Your EDM Interview: Get To Know Colorado's Said The Sky|last=Trew|first=Tyler|date=16 December 2014|website=Your EDM|access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref>

== History ==
=== 2014: Debut extended play ===
Christensen was signed by Phase Management, who he was introduced to at a music festival in the summer of 2014. He knew and was inspired by some of the artists under Phase Management, which motivated him to sign for them.<ref name=":0" />

On June 8, 2014, he self-released his debut EP ''Faith''. Tyler Trew of ''YourEDM'' reviewed the EP stating, "He plays into both of his strengths, utilizing piano heavily throughout his productions in conjunction with superior sound design, most notably in the neuro basses that can be found in all of his singles on ''Faith''. You get the most bass with "Everything" which starts off the EP quite perfectly and ever so celestially; piano and an inspiring vocal speech lead you into what is to come. That being some of the most beautifully epic music you are going to hear."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Trew|first1=Tyler|title=Said The Sky – Faith EP [Free Download] |date=June 10, 2014|url=http://www.youredm.com/2014/06/10/said-the-sky-faith-ep-free-download|website=youredm.com |accessdate=4 January 2017}}</ref>
