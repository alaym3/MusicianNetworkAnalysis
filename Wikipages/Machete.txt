A '''machete''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|ʃ|ɛ|t|i}}; {{IPA-es|maˈtʃete}}) is a broad blade used either as an  agricultural implement similar  to an [[axe]], or in combat like a long-bladed [[knife]]. The blade is typically {{convert|30|to|45|cm|in}} long and usually under {{convert|3|mm|in}} thick. In the [[Spanish language]], the word is possibly a diminutive form of the word ''macho'', which was used to refer to sledgehammers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=machete|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com|access-date=10 December 2016}}</ref>, alternatively, its origin may be ''machaera'', the name given by the Romans to the [[falcata]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivoshistoria.com/la-falcata-arma-iberica-o-mito-romantico/|title = La falcata ¿mito romántico o realidad? - Archivos de la Historia|date = 8 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.armas.es/arma-blanca/el-machete-abriendose-paso-en-jungla-y-combate|title = El Machete: Abriéndose paso en jungla y combate - Mundo Armas}}</ref> It is the origin of the [[English language]]  equivalent term ''matchet'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/matchet |title=matchet |work=Dictionary/thesaurus |publisher=The Free Dictionary |access-date=7 February 2009}}</ref> though it is less commonly used.

== Uses ==

=== Agriculture===
In various tropical and subtropical countries, the machete is frequently used to cut through [[rainforest]] undergrowth and for agricultural purposes (e.g. cutting [[sugar cane]]).<ref name="FranzRogers2012">{{cite book|last1=Franz|first1=Carl|last2=Rogers|first2=Carl Franz, Lorena Havens, Steve|last3=Havens|first3=Lorena|title=The People's Guide to Mexico|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2YZgJJXj1YC&pg=PA278|date=11 December 2012|publisher=Avalon Travel Publishing|isbn=978-1-61238-049-0|pages=277–278}}</ref> Besides this, in [[Latin America]] a common use is for such household tasks as cutting large foodstuffs into pieces—much as a [[cleaver (knife)|cleaver]] is used—or to perform crude cutting tasks, such as making simple wooden handles for other tools.<ref name="FranzRogers2012"/> It is common to see people using machetes for other jobs, such as splitting open [[coconut]]s, yard work, removing small branches and plants, chopping animals' food, and clearing bushes.<ref name="FranzRogers2012"/>

Machetes are often considered tools and used by adults. However, many [[hunter–gatherer]] societies and cultures surviving through [[subsistence agriculture]] begin teaching babies to use sharp tools, including machetes, before their first birthdays.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/how_babies_work/2013/04/09/bad_parenting_ideas_that_are_actually_good_for_some_babies.html|title=Give Your Baby a Machete|last=Day|first=Nicholas|date=9 April 2013|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|access-date=19 April 2013}}</ref>

=== Warfare ===

Because the machete is common in many tropical countries, it is often the weapon of choice for [[uprising]]s.

== Manufacture ==

Both the materials used and the shape of the machete itself are important to make a good machete.
