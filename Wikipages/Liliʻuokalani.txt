'''Liliʻuokalani''' ({{IPA-haw|liˌliʔuokəˈlɐni}}<!--As a compound word (lili'u-o-ka-lani), the stress needs checking, different sources give different patterns.-->; Lydia Liliʻu Loloku Walania Kamakaʻeha; September 2, 1838 – November 11, 1917) was the only [[queen regnant]] and the last sovereign monarch of the [[Hawaiian Kingdom]], ruling from January 29, 1891, until the [[overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] on January 17, 1893. The composer of "[[Aloha ʻOe]]" and numerous other works, she wrote her autobiography ''[[Hawaii's Story by Hawaii's Queen|Hawaiʻi's Story by Hawaiʻi's Queen]]'' during her imprisonment following the overthrow.

Liliʻuokalani was born on September 2, 1838, in [[Honolulu]], on the island of [[Oahu|Oʻahu]]. While her natural parents were [[Keohokālole|Analea Keohokālole]] and [[Kapaʻakea|Caesar Kapaʻakea]], she was ''[[hānai]]'' (informally adopted) at birth by [[Pākī|Abner Pākī]] and [[Kōnia|Laura Kōnia]] and raised with their daughter [[Bernice Pauahi Bishop]]. Baptized as a Christian and educated at the [[Royal School (Hawaii)|Royal School]], she and her siblings and cousins were proclaimed eligible for the throne by King [[Kamehameha III]]. She was married to American-born [[John Owen Dominis]], who later became the [[Governors of Oahu|Governor of Oʻahu]]. The couple had no biological children but adopted several. After the accession of her brother [[Kalākaua|David Kalākaua]] to the throne in 1874, she and her siblings were given Western style titles of Prince and Princess. In 1877, after her younger brother [[Leleiohoku II]]'s death, she was proclaimed as heir apparent to the throne. During the [[Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria]], she represented her brother as an official envoy to the United Kingdom.

Liliʻuokalani ascended to the throne on January 29, 1891, nine days after her brother's death. During her reign, she attempted to draft a [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|new constitution]] which would restore the power of the monarchy and the voting rights of the economically disenfranchised. Threatened by her attempts to abrogate the [[1887 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|Bayonet Constitution]], pro-American elements in Hawaiʻi [[Overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|overthrew]] the monarchy on January 17, 1893. The overthrow was bolstered by the landing of US Marines under [[John L. Stevens]] to protect American interests, which rendered the monarchy unable to protect itself.

The coup d'état established the [[Republic of Hawaii|Republic of Hawaiʻi]], but the ultimate goal was the annexation of the islands to the United States, which was temporarily blocked by President [[Grover Cleveland]]. After an [[1895 Wilcox rebellion|unsuccessful uprising to restore the monarchy]], the oligarchical government placed the former queen under house arrest at the [[ʻIolani Palace]]. On January 24, 1895, Liliʻuokalani was forced to abdicate the Hawaiian throne, officially ending the deposed monarchy. Attempts were made to restore the monarchy and [[Opposition to the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom|oppose annexation]], but with the outbreak of the [[Spanish–American War]], the United States [[Newlands Resolution|annexed Hawaiʻi]]. Living out the remainder of her later life as a private citizen, Liliʻuokalani [[Death and state funeral of Liliʻuokalani|died]] at her residence, [[Washington Place]], in Honolulu on November 11, 1917.

Her family were of the [[aliʻi]] class of the Hawaiian nobility and were collateral relations of the reigning [[House of Kamehameha]], sharing common descent from the 18th-century ''aliʻi nui'' (supreme monarch) [[Keaweʻīkekahialiʻiokamoku]].

After the boarding school was discontinued in 1850, Liliʻuokalani lived with her ''hānai'' parents at [[Haleʻākala]], which she referred to in later life as her childhood home. Around this time, her ''hānai'' sister Pauahi married the American [[Charles Reed Bishop]] against the wishes of their parents but reconciled with them shortly before Pākī's death in 1855. Kōnia died two years afterward and Liliʻuokalani came under the Bishops' guardianship. During this period, Liliʻuokalani became a part of the young social elite under the reign of [[Kamehameha IV]] who ascended to the throne in 1855.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=69–84}}; {{harvnb|King|Roth|2006|page=21}}; {{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Albert Pierce|title=Court Beauties of Fifty Years Ago|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=June 12, 1910|volume=VII|issue=388|page=13|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1910-06-12/ed-1/seq-13/|access-date=September 26, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170109054043/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85047084/1910-06-12/ed-1/seq-13/|archive-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref> In 1856, Kamehameha IV announced his intent to marry [[Queen Emma of Hawaii|Emma Rooke]], one of their classmates.

Marriage consideration had begun early on for her. American merchant [[Gorham D. Gilman]], a houseguest of the Pākīs, had courted her unsuccessfully when she was fifteen. Around the time of Kōnia's final illness in 1857, Liliʻuokalani was briefly engaged to [[Lunalilo|William Charles Lunalilo]]. They shared an interest in music composition and had known each other from childhood. He had been betrothed from birth to Princess Victoria, the king's sister, but disagreements with her brothers prevented the marriage from materializing. Thus, Lunalilo proposed to Liliʻuokalani during a trip to [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]] to be with Kōnia. A short-lived dual engagement occurred in which Liliʻuokalani was matched to Lunalilo and her brother Kalakaua to Princess Victoria. She ultimately broke off the engagement because of the urging of King Kamehameha IV and the opposition of the Bishops to the union.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=77, 84–89}}; {{harvnb|Haley|2014|page=217}}; {{harvnb|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=14–15}}</ref>{{#tag:ref|Historian Helena G.

Dominis was the son of Captain John Dominis, of [[Trieste]], and [[Mary Dominis|Mary Lambert Jones]], of [[Boston]]. According to Liliʻuokalani's memoir, they had known each other from childhood when he watched the royal children from a school next to the Cookes'. During a court excursion, Dominis escorted her home despite falling from his horse and breaking his leg.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=52, 84–89}}; {{harvnb|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=11–13, 16}}</ref>

From 1860 to 1862, Liliʻuokalani and Dominis were engaged with the wedding set on her twenty-fourth birthday. This was postponed to September 16, 1862, out of respect for the death of Prince [[Albert Kamehameha]], son of Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. The wedding was held at Haleʻākala, the residence of the Bishops. The ceremony was officiated by Reverend [[Samuel C. Damon|Samuel Chenery Damon]] in the [[Church of Hawaii|Anglican]] rites. Her bridemaids were her former classmates [[Elizabeth Kekaʻaniau]] and Martha Swinton. King Kamehameha IV and other members of the royal family were honored guests. The couple moved into the Dominises' residence, [[Washington Place]] in Honolulu. Through his wife and connections with the king, Dominis would later become Governor of [[Governors of Oahu|Oʻahu]] and [[Governors of Maui|Maui]].<ref name="Marriage">{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=84–89; 98–99, 103–104}}; {{harvnb|Kanahele|2002|page=97}}; {{cite news|title=Notes of the Week|newspaper=The Pacific Commercial Advertiser|location=Honolulu|date=September 18, 1862|volume=VII|issue=12|at=Image 2, col. 5|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1862-09-18/ed-1/seq-2/|access-date=October 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171108164620/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015418/1862-09-18/ed-1/seq-2/|archive-date=November 8, 2017}}; {{cite news|title=Marela|newspaper=Ka Nupepa Kuokoa|location=Honolulu|date=September 20, 1862|volume=I|issue=43|page=3|url=http://nupepa.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/nupepa?e=d-0nupepa--00-0-0--010---4----text-mid--0-1l--1haw-Zz-1--en-20-about--20-00031-0000utfZz-8-00-0003-1-0000utfZz-8-00&cl=CL1.24.2&d=HASH018d243f3ca726f62f144380.3&gg=prev|access-date=September 26, 2016}}; {{cite news|title=Na Mea Mare|newspaper=Ka Hoku o ka Pakipika|location=Honolulu|date=September 18, 1862|volume=II|issue=52|page=2|url=http://nupepa.org/gsdl2.5/cgi-bin/nupepa?e=d-0nupepa--00-0-0--010---4----text-prev--0-1l--1haw-Zz-1--en-20-about--20-00031-0000utfZz-8-00-0003-1-0000utfZz-8-00&a=d&cl=CL1.10.2&d=HASH019b9459d02f1e2f7f745385.2|access-date=September 26, 2016}}</ref> The union was reportedly an unhappy one with much gossip about Dominis' infidelities and domestic strife between Liliʻuokalani and Dominis' mother Mary who disapproved of the marriage of her son with a Hawaiian.<ref>{{harvnb|Allen|1982|pages=109–153, 159–161}}; {{harvnb|Haley|2014|page=200}}; {{harvnb|Blount|1895|page=996}}</ref> They never had any children of their own, but, against the wish of her husband and brother, Liliʻuokalani adopted three ''hānai'' children: [[Lydia Kaʻonohiponiponiokalani Aholo]], the daughter of a [[Luther Aholo|family friend]]; [[Joseph Kaiponohea ʻAeʻa]], the son of a retainer; and [[John ʻAimoku Dominis]], her husband's son.{{sfn|Bonura|Witmer|2013|pages=109–115}}{{#tag:ref|John Dominis ʻAimoku formally changed his surname to Dominis in 1910.{{sfn|Allen|1982|pages=159–160}}|group=note}}

Liliʻuokalani was active in philanthropy and the welfare of her people. In 1886, she founded a bank for women in Honolulu named Liliuokalani's Savings Bank and helped Isabella Chamberlain Lyman establish Kumukanawai o ka Liliuokalani Hui Hookuonoono, a money lending group for women in [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]. In the same year, she also founded the [[Liliʻuokalani Educational Society]], an organization "to interest the Hawaiian ladies in the proper training of young girls of their own race whose parents would be unable to give them advantages by which they would be prepared for the duties of life." It supported the tuition of Hawaiian girls at [[Mid-Pacific Institute|Kawaiahaʻo Seminary for Girls]], where her hānai daughter Lydia Aholo attended, and [[Kamehameha Schools|Kamehameha School]].{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=113–114}}{{sfn|Bonura|Witmer|2013|pages=120–121}}<ref name="Hawe2018">{{cite news|last=Hawe|first=Jeff|title=Ahead of Her Time|magazine=Hawaii Business Magazine|location=Honolulu|date=August 7, 2018|url=https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/ahead-of-her-time/|access-date=January 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190103001837/https://www.hawaiibusiness.com/ahead-of-her-time/|archive-date=January 3, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Kalākaua arrived in California aboard the [[USS Charleston (C-2)|USS ''Charleston'']] on November 25, 1890. There was uncertainty as to the purpose of the king's trip. Minister of Foreign Affairs [[John Adams Cummins]] reported that the trip was solely for the king's health and would not extend beyond California, while local newspapers and the British commissioner James Hay Wodehouse speculated that the king might go further east to Washington, D.C. to negotiate a treaty to extend the existing exclusive US access rights to Pearl Harbor, or the annexation of the kingdom. The [[McKinley Tariff]] Act had crippled the Hawaiian sugar industry by removing the duties on sugar imports from other countries into the US, eliminating the previous Hawaiian duty-free advantage under the [[Reciprocity Treaty of 1875]].{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=466

From May 1892 to January 1893, the legislature of the Kingdom convened for an unprecedented 171 days, which later historians such as Albertine Loomis and Helena G.

Debates heard on the floor of the houses concerned the popular demand for a new constitution and the passage of a [[lottery]] bill and an [[opium]] licensing bill, aimed at alleviating the economic crisis caused by the McKinley Tariff. The main issues of contention between the new monarch and the legislators were the retention of her cabinet ministers, since political division prevented Liliʻuokalani from appointing a balanced council and the 1887 constitution gave the legislature the power to vote for the dismissal of her cabinet. Seven resolutions of want of confidence were introduced during this session, and four of her self-appointed cabinets (the Widemann, [[Edward C. Macfarlane|Macfarlane]], [[William H. Cornwell|Cornwell]], and [[George Norton Wilcox|Wilcox]] cabinets) were ousted by votes of the legislature. On January 13, 1893, after the legislature dismissed the George Norton Wilcox cabinet (which had political sympathies to the Reform Party), Liliʻuokalani appointed the new Parker cabinet consisting of Samuel Parker, as minister of foreign affairs; [[John F. Colburn]], as minister of the interior; William H. Cornwell, as minister of finance; and [[Arthur P.

{{Main|Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom}}
The precipitating event{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=582}} leading to the 1893 overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom was the attempt by Queen Liliʻuokalani to promulgate a new constitution to regain powers for the monarchy and Native Hawaiians that had been lost under the Bayonet Constitution. Her opponents, who were led by two Hawaiian citizens [[Lorrin A. Thurston]] and W. O. Smith and included six Hawaiian citizens, five US citizens and one German citizen,{{sfn|Blount|1895|page=588}} were outraged by her attempt to promulgate a new constitution and moved to depose the Queen, overthrow the monarchy, and seek Hawaii's annexation to the United States.{{#tag:ref|"W.D.

Thurston later wrote that his motion was 'substantially as follows: "I move that it is the sense of this meeting that the solution of the present situation is annexation to the United States."'(''Memoirs'', p. 250) Lt. Lucien Young (''The Boston at Hawaii'', p. 175) gives the following version of the motion: 'Resolved, That it is the sense of this committee that in view of the present unsatisfactory state of affairs, the proper course to pursue is to abolish the monarchy and apply for annexation to the United States.'"{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=587–588}}|group=note}}{{sfn|Russ|1959|page=90}}

Shortly after her accession, Liliʻuokalani began to receive petitions to re-write the Bayonet Constitution{{#tag:ref|The [[Bayonet Constitution]] was named because it had been signed by the previous monarch under threat of violence from a militia composed of armed American and Europeans calling themselves the "[[Honolulu Rifles]]".{{sfn|Lee|1993|pages=4–5}}|group=note}} through the two major political parties of the time, [[Hui Kālaiʻāina]] and the National Reform Party.{{#tag:ref|"She&nbsp;... defended her act[ions] by showing that, out of a possible 9,500 native voters in 1892, 6,500 asked for a new Constitution."{{sfn|Russ|1959|page=67}}|group=note}} Supported by two-thirds of the registered voters,{{sfn|Lobo|Talbot|Carlston|2016|page=122}} she moved to abrogate the existing 1887 constitution, but her cabinet withheld their support, knowing what her opponents' likely response would be.{{#tag:ref|The Queen's new cabinet "had been in office less than a week, and whatever they thought about the need for a new constitution ... they knew enough about the temper of the queen's opponents to realize that they would endure the chance to challenge her, and no minister of the crown could look forward ... to that confrontation".{{sfn|Daws|1968|page=271}}|group=note}}

The [[Proposed 1893 Constitution of the Hawaiian Kingdom|proposed constitution]] (co-written by the Queen and two legislators, [[Joseph Nāwahī]] and [[William Pūnohu White]]) would have restored the power to the monarchy, and voting rights to economically disenfranchised native Hawaiians and Asians.{{sfn|Daws|1968|page=271}}{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|pages=582–586}} Her ministers and closest friends were all opposed to this plan; they tried unsuccessfully to dissuade her from pursuing these initiatives, both of which came to be used against her in the brewing constitutional crisis.{{sfn|Blount|1895|page=496}}

The political fallout led to citywide political rallies and meetings in Honolulu. Anti-monarchists, annexationists, and leading Reform Party politicians that included [[Lorrin A. Thurston]], a grandson of American missionaries, and Kalākaua's former cabinet ministers under the Bayonet Constitution, formed the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] in protest of the "revolutionary" action of the queen and conspired to depose her.<ref name="Meetings" /> Thurston and the Committee of Safety derived their support primarily from the American and European business class residing in Hawaiʻi. Most of the leaders of the overthrow were American and European citizens who were also Kingdom subjects. They also included legislators, government officers, and a justice of the Hawaiian Supreme Court.{{sfn|Twigg-Smith|1998|pages=135–166}}{{sfn|Andrade|1996|page=130}}

In response, [[royalists]] and loyalists formed the Committee of Law and Order and met at the palace square on January 16, 1893. Nāwahī, White, Robert W. Wilcox, and other pro-monarchist leaders gave speeches in support for the queen and the government. To try to appease the instigators, the queen and her supporters abandoned attempts to unilaterally promulgate a constitution .<ref>{{cite news|title=Popular Meeting – Over Two Thousand Person Assemble on Palace Square – They Pass a Resolution Upholding the Queen and the Government|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=January 17, 1893|page=2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1893-01-17/ed-1/seq-2/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119064916/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1893-01-17/ed-1/seq-2/|archive-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref><ref name="Meetings">{{harvnb|Kuykendall|1967|pages=586–594}}; {{harvnb|Alexander|1896|pages=37–51}}</ref>

The same day, the Marshal of the Kingdom, [[Charles Burnett Wilson]], was tipped off by detectives to the imminent planned coup. Wilson requested [[Warrant (law)|warrants]] to arrest the 13-member council of the Committee of Safety, and put the Kingdom under [[martial law]]. Because the members had strong political ties to [[List of ministers of the United States to Hawaii|United States Minister to Hawaii]] [[John L. Stevens]], the requests were repeatedly denied by the queen's cabinet, who feared that the arrests would escalate the situation. After a failed negotiation with Thurston,{{sfn|Twombly|1900|page=333}} Wilson began to collect his men for the confrontation. Wilson and captain of the [[Royal Guards of Hawaii|Royal Household Guard]] [[Samuel Nowlein]] had rallied a force of 496 men who were kept at hand to protect the queen.{{sfn|Young|1899|page=252}} [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] from the [[USS Boston (1884)|USS ''Boston'']] and two companies of US sailors landed and took up positions at the US Legation, the Consulate, and Arion Hall. The sailors and Marines did not enter the palace grounds or take over any buildings, and never fired a shot, but their presence served effectively in intimidating royalist defenders. Historian William Russ states, "the injunction to prevent fighting of any kind made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself".<ref>{{harvnb|Russ|1959|page=350}}</ref>

The queen was deposed on January 17, and the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|provisional government]] established under pro-annexation leader [[Sanford B.

The annexation treaty presented to the US Senate contained a provision to grant Liliʻuokalani a $20,000 per annum lifetime pension, and Kaʻiulani a lump-sum payment of $150,000. The queen protested the proposed annexation in a January 19 letter to President [[Benjamin Harrison]]. She sent Prince [[David Kawānanakoa]] and [[Paul Neumann (Attorney General)|Paul Neumann]] to represent her.{{sfn|Alexander|1896|pages=71–76}}

Neumann delivered a letter from the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4.{{sfn|Alexander|1896|page=74}} The Cleveland administration commissioned [[James Henderson Blount]] to investigate the overthrow. He interviewed those involved in the coup and wrote the [[Blount Report]], and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister [[Albert S. Willis]] to propose a return of the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her first response was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and the death penalty for treason, and that only her cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty.{{sfn|Calhoun|1988|page=150}}{{sfn|Love|2005|page=112}}{{sfn|Cleaver|2014|page=29}}{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=642}}   Liliuokalani's extreme position lost her the goodwill of the Cleveland administration.<ref>{{cite book|author=Warren Zimmermann|title=First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TPg3gNPWqQC&pg=PA290|year=2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|page=290|isbn=9780374528935|access-date=April 26, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822024136/https://books.google.com/books?id=_TPg3gNPWqQC&pg=PA290|archive-date=August 22, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

At the beginning of January 1895, Robert W. Wilcox and Samuel Nowlein launched a [[1895 Wilcox rebellion|rebellion]] against the forces of the Republic with the aim of restoring the queen and the monarchy. Its ultimate failure led to the arrest of many of the participants and other sympathizers of the monarchy. Liliʻuokalani was also arrested and imprisoned in an upstairs bedroom at the palace on January 16, several days after the failed rebellion, when [[firearm]]s were found at her home of Washington Place after a tip from a prisoner.<ref>{{cite news|title=Queen Arrested|newspaper=The Daily Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=January 16, 1895|volume=IX|issue=1238|at=Image 3. col. 1|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1895-01-16/ed-1/seq-3/|access-date=October 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002221224/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016412/1895-01-16/ed-1/seq-3/|archive-date=October 2, 2017}}; {{cite news|title=She Plotted|newspaper=The Hawaiian Star|location=Honolulu|date=January 17, 1895|volume=III|issue=557|at=p. 3, col. 2|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015415/1895-01-17/ed-1/seq-3/|access-date=October 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002221228/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82015415/1895-01-17/ed-1/seq-3/|archive-date=October 2, 2017}}</ref>

In 1898, Liliʻuokalani wrote:

In June 1897 President McKinley signed the "Treaty for the Annexation for the Hawaiian Islands", but it failed to pass in the [[United States Senate]] after the [[Kūʻē Petitions]] were submitted by a commission of Native Hawaiian delegates consisting of [[James Keauiluna Kaulia]], [[David Kalauokalani]], [[William Auld (Hawaii)|William Auld]], and [[John Richardson (Hawaii)|John Richardson]]. Members of [[Hui Aloha ʻĀina]] collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because those signatures were also asking for restoration of the Queen. The petitions collectively were presented as evidence of the strong grassroots opposition of the Hawaiian community to annexation, and the treaty was defeated in the Senate— however, following its failure, Hawaii was annexed anyway via the [[Newlands Resolution]], a [[joint resolution]] of Congress, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.{{sfn|Haley|2014|pages=317–336}}<ref name="SilvaPetition">{{harvnb|Silva|2004|pages=123–163}}; {{cite web|last=Silva |first=Noenoe K. |title=The 1897 Petitions Protesting Annexation |work=The Annexation Of Hawaii: A Collection Of Document |year=1998 |publisher=University of Hawaii at Manoa |url=http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/petition/pet-intro.php |access-date=December 19, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230013831/http://libweb.hawaii.edu/digicoll/annexation/petition/pet-intro.php |archive-date=December 30, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>{{sfn|Parker|2007|page=205}}{{sfn|Mehmed|1998|pages=142–143}}

Dole handed over "the sovereignty and public property of the Hawaiian Islands" to United States Minister [[Harold M. Sewall]]. The flag of the Republic of Hawaii was lowered and the flag of the United States was raised in its place.{{sfn|Haley|2014|pages=336}} Liliʻuokalani and her family members and retainers boycotted the event and shuttered themselves away at Washington Place.

== Crown Lands of Hawaii ==
Prior to the 1848 division of land known as the [[Great Māhele]], during the reign of Kamehameha III, all land in Hawaii was owned by the monarchy. The Great Māhele subdivided the land among the monarchy, the government, and private ownership by tenants living on the land. What was reserved for the monarchy became known as the Crown Lands of Hawaii.{{sfn|Linnekin|1983|page=173}} When Hawaii was annexed, the Crown Lands were seized by the United States government. The Queen gave George Macfarlane her power of attorney in 1898 as part of her legal defense team in seeking indemnity for the government's seizure of the Crown Lands. She filed a protest with the United States Senate on December 20, 1898, requesting their return and claiming the lands were seized without due process or recompense.<ref>{{cite news|title=HAWAII'S EX-QUEEN: Protests Against the Seizure of Her Property|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Herald-Express|The Herald]]|location=Los Angeles|date=December 21, 1898|volume=26|issue=82|at=Image 1. col. 3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042461/1898-12-21/ed-1/seq-1/|access-date=October 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170228124422/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85042461/1898-12-21/ed-1/seq-1/|archive-date=February 28, 2017}}</ref>

=== ''Liliʻuokalani v. the United States'' ===
In 1909, Liliʻuokalani brought an unsuccessful lawsuit against the United States under the Fifth Amendment seeking the return of the Hawaiian Crown Lands.{{sfn|Parker|2007|page=205}} The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest sense of the term.{{sfn|Banner|2009|page=161}}

Although Liliʻuokalani was never successful in more than a decade of legal pursuits for recompense from the United States government for seized land, in 1911 she was finally granted a lifetime pension of $1,250 a month by the Territory of Hawaii. Historian Sydney Lehua Iaukea noted that the grant never addressed the question of the legality of the seizure itself, and the figure was greatly reduced from what she had requested for recompense.<ref>{{harvnb|Iaukea|2012|pp=86, 181}}; {{cite news|title=Queen's Pension is Approved|newspaper=Evening Bulletin|location=Honolulu|date=March 30, 1911|at=p. 2, col. 3|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016413/1911-03-30/ed-1/seq-2/|access-date=October 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119064942/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn82016413/1911-03-30/ed-1/seq-2/|archive-date=November 19, 2017}}</ref>

== Religious beliefs ==
Educated by American Protestant missionaries from a young age, Liliʻuokalani became a devout Christian and adherent to the principles of Christianity. These missionaries were largely of [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]] and [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] extractions, subscribing to [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] theology, and Liliʻuokalani considered herself a "regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship".{{sfnm|1a1=Allen|1y=1982|1pp=69|2a1=Merry|2y=2000|2p=63|3a1=Liliuokalani|3y=1898|3p=269}} She was the first member of the royal family to consistently and regularly attend service at Kawaiahaʻo Church since King Kamehameha IV converted to [[Anglicanism]]. On Sundays, she played the organ and led the choir at Kawaiahaʻo. She also regularly attended service at [[Kaumakapili Church]] and held a special interest in the [[Liliuokalani Protestant Church|Liliʻuokalani Protestant Church]], to which she donated the Queen Liliʻuokalani Clock in 1892.{{sfnm|1a1=Kuykendall|1y=1967|1p=479|2a1=Allen|2y=1982|2pp=76–77}}

Historian Helena G. Allen noted that Liliʻuokalani and Kalākaua "believed all religions had their 'rights' and were entitled to equal treatment and opportunities". Throughout her life, Liliʻuokalani showed a broad interest in the different Christian faiths including [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Mormonism]], [[Anglicanism|Episcopalianism]] and other [[Protestantism|Protestant]] denominations.{{sfn|Allen|1982|page=241}} In 1896, she became a regular member of the Hawaiian Congregation at [[Cathedral Church of Saint Andrew (Honolulu)|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] associated with the Reformed Catholic (Anglican/Episcopal) Church of Hawaii, which King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma had founded.{{sfn|Kuykendall|1967|page=479}} During the overthrow and her imprisonment, Bishop [[Alfred Willis]] of St. Andrew's Cathedral had openly supported the Queen while Reverend [[Henry Hodges Parker]] of Kawaiahaʻo had supported her opponents.{{sfnm|1a1=Kuykendall|1y=1967|1p=479|2a1=Garrett|2y=1992|2p=238}} Bishop Willis visited and wrote to her during her imprisonment and sent her a copy of the [[Book of Common Prayer]].{{sfn|Allen|1982|page=346}} Shortly after her release on parole, the former queen was baptized and confirmed by Bishop Willis on May 18, 1896, in a private ceremony in the presence of the sisters of St. Andrew's Priory.<ref>{{cite news|title=Join St. Andrew's – Ex-queen Liliuokalani Confirmed by Bishop Willis|newspaper=Hawaiian Gazette|location=Honolulu|date=May 19, 1896|volume=XXXI|issue=40|at=p. 4, col. 6|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1896-05-19/ed-1/seq-4/|access-date=October 15, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171001035930/http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83025121/1896-05-19/ed-1/seq-4/|archive-date=October 1, 2017}}</ref> In her memoir, Liliʻuokalani stated:

<blockquote>That first night of my imprisonment was the longest night I have ever passed in my life; it seemed as though the dawn of day would never come. I found in my bag a small Book of Common Prayer according to the ritual of the Episcopal Church. It was a great comfort to me, and before retiring to rest Mrs. Clark and I spent a few minutes in the devotions appropriate to the evening. Here, perhaps, I may say, that although I had been a regular attendant on the Presbyterian worship since my childhood, a constant contributor to all the missionary societies, and had helped to build their churches and ornament the walls, giving my time and my musical ability freely to make their meetings attractive to my people, yet none of these pious church members or clergymen remembered me in my prison. To this (Christian ?) conduct I contrast that of the Anglican bishop, Rt. Rev. Alfred Willis, who visited me from time to time in my house, and in whose church I have since been confirmed as a communicant. But he was not allowed to see me at the palace.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|page=269}}</blockquote>

A compilation of her works, titled ''The Queen's Songbook'', was published in 1999 by the Queen Liliʻuokalani Trust.<ref name="HawaiiMagazine2004" />{{sfn|Silva|2004|page=201}} Liliʻuokalani used her musical compositions as a way to express her feelings for her people, her country, and what was happening in the political realm in Hawaiʻi.<ref name="DucatPBS">{{cite web|last=Ducat|first=Vivian|title=Hawaii's Last Queen|work=American Experience|publisher=PBS|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hawaii/program.html|access-date=October 11, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828041232/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/hawaii/program.html|archive-date=August 28, 2011}}</ref> One example of the way her music reflected her political views is her translation of the [[Kumulipo]], the Hawaiian creation chant passed down orally by her great grandmother [[Alapaiwahine]].

After Liliʻuokalani was imprisoned in the ʻIolani Palace, she was denied literature and newspapers, essentially cutting her off from her people, but she continued to compose music with paper and pencil while she was in confinement.{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=289–90}}
Another of her compositions was "Aloha ʻOe", a song she had written previously and transcribed during her confinement. In her writings, she says, "At first I had no instrument, and had to transcribe the notes by voice alone; but I found, notwithstanding disadvantages, great consolation in composing, and transcribed a number of songs. Three found their way from my prison to the city of Chicago, where they were printed, among them the 'Aloha ʻOe' or 'Farewell to Thee', which became a very popular song."{{sfn|Liliuokalani|1898|pages=289–90}} Originally written as a lover's good-bye, the song came to be regarded as a symbol of, and lament for, the loss of her country. Today, it is one of the most recognizable Hawaiian songs.<ref name="DucatPBS" /><ref name="Dekneef2016" /><ref name="BolanteKeany2007" />
