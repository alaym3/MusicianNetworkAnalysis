==Early years==
Kershaw was born on 1 March 1958 in [[Bristol]], England,<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4668|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Stephen Thomas Erlewine |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=23 March 2009}}</ref> and grew up in [[Ipswich]], Suffolk. His father was a flautist and his mother was an opera singer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisnotretro.com/interviews/nik-kershaw-interview-2012 |title=NIK KERSHAW INTERVIEW [2012&#93; • THIS IS ''NOT'' RETRO – 80s Music.|work=Thisisnotretro.com |date=9 August 2012 |access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref>  He was educated at [[Northgate High School, Ipswich|Northgate Grammar School for Boys]] where he played the guitar – he was self-taught on this instrument. He left school in the middle of his [[A-level]]s and got a job at an unemployment benefit office.<ref name="telegraph.co.uk">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/11077555/Nik-Kershaw-I-made-millions-from-four-songs.html |title=Nik Kershaw: 'I made millions from four songs' |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=7 September 2014|access-date=16 August 2015}}</ref> He also sang in a number of underground Ipswich bands. However, when the last of these, Fusion, split up in 1982, he embarked on a full-time solo career as a musician and songwriter.<ref name="AMG"/>

==Career==
===1980s===
Kershaw was unemployed for a year after leaving Fusion, but during this time he found manager Mickey Modern after placing an advertisement in the magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]''. Modern secured a record deal for Kershaw at [[MCA Records|MCA]].<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> In September 1983, Kershaw released his first single "[[I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me]]", which reached No. 47 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.classicpopmag.com/2020/11/nik-kershaw-album-by-album/|title=Nik Kershaw – Album by Album|website=Classicpopmag.com|date=19 November 2020|access-date=19 September 2021}}</ref> It became a major hit in Scandinavia, Switzerland and the Netherlands.

At the beginning of 1984, Kershaw released his breakthrough song "[[Wouldn't It Be Good]]",<ref name="AMG"/> which reached No. 4 in the UK, and was a big success in Europe, particularly in Ireland, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Scandinavia, and also in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The music video, featuring Kershaw as a [[chroma key]]-suited [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|alien]], received heavy rotation from [[MTV]], helping the song to reach No. 46 in the United States. He enjoyed three more Top 20 hits from his debut solo album ''[[Human Racing]]'', including the [[Human Racing (song)|title track]] and a successful re-issue of "I Won't Let the Sun Go Down on Me".<ref name="AMG"/> This track ultimately proved his biggest hit as a performer when it reached No. 2 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/>

Kershaw's second album was ''[[The Riddle (album)|The Riddle]]''. The [[The Riddle (Nik Kershaw song)|title-track]], released in November 1984, proved to be his third international [[hit single]], reaching No. 3 in the UK and Ireland, and No. 6 in New Zealand. The album also spawned two more UK [[Top 40|Top 10]] hits, "[[Wide Boy (song)|Wide Boy]]" and "[[Don Quixote (Nik Kershaw song)|Don Quixote]]", as it went [[Music recording sales certification|multi-platinum]]. During this time, Kershaw toured extensively with his backing band the Krew, consisting of Keith Airey, Tim Moore, [[Mark Price (musician)|Mark Price]] and Dennis Smith.<ref name="NME">[https://www.nme.com/artists/nik-kershaw Nik Kershaw]. Nme.com (11 February 1999). Retrieved on 20 November 2011.</ref>

In July 1985, Kershaw was among the performers at [[Live Aid]], held at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. He described the experience as "absolutely terrifying".<ref name="telegraph.co.uk"/> The concert turned out to be the peak of his career, as his stardom began to wane soon afterwards and he enjoyed only one more UK Top 40 hit. He continued to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]] and release [[gramophone record|records]] and collaborated with others on a number of projects. Also in 1985, [[Elton John]] asked Kershaw to play guitar on John's hit single, "[[Nikita (song)|Nikita]]".<ref name="NME"/>

A cover of "Wouldn't it be Good" by the [[Danny Hutton]] Hitters appeared on the [[Pretty in Pink (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of the 1986 teen [[romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] ''[[Pretty in Pink]]''. Later that same year, Kershaw's third solo album, ''[[Radio Musicola]]'', was released to critical acclaim but to little commercial success.<ref name="AMG"/> ''[[The Works (Nik Kershaw album)|The Works]]'' was released in 1989, also to little success.<ref name="auto"/> Two singles were released from the album, "[[One Step Ahead (Nik Kershaw song)|One Step Ahead]]" and "[[Elisabeth's Eyes]]".

===1990s===
Kershaw's prowess as a songwriter served him well in 1991, when his song "[[The One and Only (song)|The One and Only]]" appeared on the soundtrack to the British film ''[[Buddy's Song (film)|Buddy's Song]]'', and in the American movie ''[[Doc Hollywood]]''. "The One and Only" proved to be a UK [[chart-topper|No. 1]] hit for the star of ''Buddy's Song'', [[Chesney Hawkes]].

During 1991, he worked with [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]], the keyboard player of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], on Banks' third solo album ''[[Still (Tony Banks album)|Still]]''. Kershaw co-wrote two songs with Banks, providing lead vocals on both. He also sang on the Banks composition “The Final Curtain”.<ref>writing credits on the album cover</ref>

In 1993, [[the Hollies]] had a minor hit with another of Kershaw's songs, "The Woman I Love". During the mid-1990s he also wrote and produced material for the [[boy band]] [[Let Loose]], with two of the tracks ("Seventeen" and "Everybody Say Everybody Do") achieving reasonable success. Following this year, Kershaw appeared on Elton John's 1993 ''Duets'' album, where Kershaw not only wrote the song but produced, and played all the instruments on the track.

The year 1999 saw the release of the album ''[[15 Minutes (Nik Kershaw album)|15 Minutes]]''.<ref name="AMG"/> Kershaw decided to [[sound recording and reproduction|record]] the tracks himself, when he could not envisage them being recorded by other artists.<ref>{{citation |url=//www.nikkershaw.net/darkglasses.html |title=Archived copy of Dark Glasses article |date=21 October 2001 |access-date=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011021222050/http://www.nikkershaw.net/darkglasses.html |archive-date=21 October 2001  }}</ref> The album spawned two singles, "[[Somebody Loves You (Nik Kerhaw song)|Somebody Loves You]]" and "What Do You Think of It So Far?", the latter a song described as "an elegant and soaring ode to the transience of time, infused with both self-doubt and an acceptance of life that can only come with maturity".<ref name="RM&B p71">''Record Mart & Buyer'', Issue 12, July 1999, p. 71</ref>

===2000–present===
The follow-up album, ''[[To Be Frank]]'', was released in 2001. Over the years, Kershaw has collaborated on albums with artists such as Elton John, [[Bonnie Tyler]], [[Sia (musician)|Sia]] and [[Gary Barlow]].<ref>{{cite news|title=80s popstar Nik Kershaw to play special acoustic show at the Regent|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/11473463.80s_popstar_Nik_Kershaw_to_play_special_acoustic_show_at_the_Regent/|access-date=9 December 2015|newspaper=[[Bournemouth Echo]]|date=15 September 2014}}</ref>

In 2005, Kershaw released ''[[Then and Now (Nik Kershaw album)|Then And Now]]'', a collection of earlier material with four new tracks.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.discogs.com/Nik-Kershaw-Then-Now/release/2023620|title=Nik Kershaw - Then and Now|access-date=1 June 2016}}</ref> In 2006, he completed another solo album, ''[[You've Got to Laugh]]'', available only through his website or digitally through [[iTunes]]. This album contained twelve tracks and was released on the musician's own label, Shorthouse Records.<ref name="auto"/> Neither ''Then And Now'' nor ''You've Got To Laugh'' was promoted by a tour. The year also saw the [[ITunes|digital]] re-release of his 1980s back catalogue including ''Human Racing'', ''The Riddle'', ''Radio Musicola'' and ''The Works''.

In August 2009, Kershaw performed at [[Fairport Convention|Fairport's Cropredy Convention]] and the [[Rewind Festival]] on [[Temple Island Meadows]] at [[Henley-on-Thames]].<ref>{{citation |author=Serck, Linda|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2009/01/28/rewind_80s_festival_feature.shtml|title=Back to the 80s for Rewind Festival|website=Bbc.co.uk|date=21 August 2009|access-date=20 November 2011}}</ref>

Kershaw wrote songs and performed for the soundtrack of the 2010 film, ''[[Round Ireland with a Fridge]]'' by [[Tony Hawks]]. He wrote and sang the theme song, "If It Gets Much Better Than This". He also appeared as an extra in the penultimate scene, presenting a copy of the book to Hawks for signing in the book shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/interview-10-questions-nik-kershaw |title=Interview: 10 Questions for Nik Kershaw &#124; New music reviews, news & interviews |website=The Arts Desk |access-date=30 June 2014}}</ref>
