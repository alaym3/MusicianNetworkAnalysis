The newly formed band did not yet have a name. Sixx has said that he told his bandmates that he was "thinking about calling the band "Christmas". The other members were not very receptive to that idea. Then, while trying to find a suitable name, Mars remembered an incident that occurred when he was playing with a band called White Horse, when one of the other band members called the group "a motley looking crew". He had remembered the phrase and later copied it down as 'Mottley Cru'. After modifying the spelling slightly, "Mötley Crüe" was eventually selected as the band's name, with the stylistic decision suggested by Neil to add the two sets of [[metal umlaut]]s, supposedly inspired by the German beer [[Löwenbräu]], which the members were drinking at the time.<ref>{{cite web |title=38 Years Ago: Nikki Sixx Forms Motley Crue |url=https://loudwire.com/motley-crue-founded-anniversary/ |website=Loudwire.com |access-date=November 18, 2019 |archive-date=November 11, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111070449/https://loudwire.com/motley-crue-founded-anniversary/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Other than the periods of February 1992 to September 1996 and of March 1999 to September 2004, the lineup of Neil, Sixx, Lee, and Mars remained the same.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motley Crue Lineup Changes: A Complete Guide |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-lineup-changes/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617132312/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-lineup-changes/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The band soon met its first manager, Allan Coffman, the thirty-eight-year-old brother-in-law of a friend of Mars's driver.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/81.htm |title=Chronological Crue |publisher=Members.ozemail.com.au |access-date=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019034117/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/81.htm |archive-date=October 19, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The band's first release was the single "Stick to Your Guns/Toast of the Town", which was released on its own record label, [[Leathür Records]], which had a pressing and distribution deal with Greenworld Distribution in [[Torrance, California]].

During the "Crüesing Through Canada Tour '82", there were several widely publicized incidents. First, the band was arrested and then released at [[Edmonton International Airport]] for wearing their spiked stage wardrobe (considered "dangerous weapons") through customs, and for Neil arriving with a small carry-on filled with porn magazines (considered "indecent material"); both were staged [[Public relations|PR]] stunts. Customs eventually had the confiscated items destroyed. Second, while playing Scandals Disco in [[Edmonton]], a spurious "bomb threat" against the band made the front page of the ''[[Edmonton Journal]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/info/library.html |title=Edmonton Journal Library |publisher=Canada.com |access-date=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100301085948/http://www2.canada.com/edmontonjournal/info/library.html |archive-date=March 1, 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> on June 9, 1982; Lee and assistant band manager Greif were interviewed by police as a result. This too ended up being a staged PR stunt perpetrated by Greif. Lastly, Lee threw a television set from an upper story window of the Sheraton Caravan Hotel. Canadian rock magazine ''Music Express'' noted that the band was "banned for life" from the city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Patch |first1=Nick |title=Motley Crue's Nikki Sixx describes being kicked out of Canada in the '80s |url=https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/motley-crue-s-nikki-sixx-describes-being-kicked-out-of-canada-in-the-80s-1.2202166 |website=CTV News |date=January 23, 2015 |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=January 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103194246/https://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/motley-crue-s-nikki-sixx-describes-being-kicked-out-of-canada-in-the-80s-1.2202166 |url-status=live}}</ref> Despite the tour ending prematurely in financial disaster, it was the basis for the band's first international press.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/greif.shtml |title=Eric Greif Interview |publisher=Sleaze Roxx |date=April 28, 2007 |access-date=October 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929001925/http://www.sleazeroxx.com/interviews/greif.shtml |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1983, the band changed management from Coffman to Doug Thaler and [[Doc McGhee]]. McGhee is best known for managing [[Bon Jovi]] and later [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], starting with their reunion tour in 1996. Greif subsequently sued all parties in a Los Angeles Superior Court action that dragged on for several years, and coincidentally later re-surfaced as manager of Sixx's former band, [[London (heavy metal band)|London]]. Coffman himself was sued by several investors to whom he had sold "stock in the band", including [[Michigan]]-based Bill Larson. Coffman eventually declared bankruptcy, as he had mortgaged his home at least three times to cover band expenses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Views - Too Fast Perspective |url=http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/exclusive.htm |website=Chronological Crue |access-date=29 December 2019 |archive-date=September 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190922035214/http://members.ozemail.com.au/~cruekiss/exclusive.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>

===1983–1991: International fame and addiction struggles===
"Too Fast For Love", the title track from the band's debut album, was reportedly recorded over a span of three days while the band members were under the [[influence of alcohol]].  Their antics included, according to the website "Page Six" [[urinating in public]] or on the floors of their bedrooms, and throwing beds and furniture such as [[futons]] out of hotel windows in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]]. Nikki Sixx had been arrested for the first time while selling "chocolate" mescaline at a Rolling Stones concert in 1973. The band became rapidly successful in the United States after playing at the [[US Festival]] in May 1983,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Edwards |first1=Gavin |title=Flashback: Motley Crue Rocks the US Festival in 1983 |url=https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/news/flashback-motley-crue-rocks-us-festival-1983-191800424-rolling-stone.html |website=Yahoo!

The band members also had their share of scrapes with the law. On December 8, 1984, Neil was driving home from a liquor run in his [[De Tomaso Pantera]] which ended in a head-on collision; his passenger, [[Hanoi Rocks]] drummer [[Razzle (musician)|Nicholas "Razzle" Dingley]], was killed.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Day Hanoi Rocks Drummer Razzle Was Killed in a Car Crash |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/razzle-hanoi-rocks-killed/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617164456/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/razzle-hanoi-rocks-killed/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Neil, charged with a [[Driving under the influence|DUI]] and [[Manslaughter#Vehicular or intoxication manslaughter|vehicular manslaughter]], was sentenced to 30 days in jail (though he only served 18 days) and subsequently sued for $2,500,000.

Mötley Crüe spent most of the next year on a [[Theatre of Pain Tour|world tour]] in support of ''Theatre of Pain''. In February 1986 in [[London]], [[England]] Sixx suffered a near-fatal heroin overdose, and the person who sold him the drugs dumped his unconscious body in a [[dumpster]]. The incident inspired Sixx to write the song "Dancing on Glass" for their next album.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Greatest 80s Song Inspired By An Overdose And A Rock Star Left For Dead |url=https://culturacolectiva.com/music/nikki-sixx-motley-crue-dancing-on-glass |website=Culture Collectiva |date=September 15, 2017 |access-date=29 December 2019 |archive-date=February 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202225655/https://culturacolectiva.com/music/nikki-sixx-motley-crue-dancing-on-glass |url-status=live}}</ref>

On December 23, 1987, Sixx suffered a heroin overdose. He was declared clinically dead on the way to the hospital, but the paramedic, who was a Crüe fan, [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|revived]] Sixx with two shots of adrenaline.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mötley Crüe and the Real Story of Nikki Sixx's Overdose: Going Beyond 'The Dirt' |url=https://www.newsweek.com/motley-crue-nikki-sixx-overdose-dirt-1368786 |website=Newsweek |date=March 22, 2019 |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224639/https://www.newsweek.com/motley-crue-nikki-sixx-overdose-dirt-1368786 |url-status=live}}</ref> His two minutes in death were the inspiration for the song "[[Kickstart My Heart]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;16 on the Mainstream U.S. chart, and which was featured on the 1989 U.S. number one (their first) album ''[[Dr. Feelgood (album)|Dr. Feelgood]]''. From 1986 to 1987, Sixx kept a daily diary of his heroin addiction and eventually entered rehab in January 1988.

In 1988, controversy again hit the band in the form of a lawsuit by Matthew Trippe. Trippe claimed that Sixx was hospitalized in 1983 after a car crash involving drugs and that he had been hired as Sixx's [[doppelgänger]]. The suit was regarding the loss of royalties from his time in Mötley Crüe and the case was not closed until 1993 when Trippe dropped his charges and disappeared from public view.<ref name="weebly1988">{{cite web |url=http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/matthew-trippe---may-1988.html |title=Matthew Trippe – May 1988 – Klassic Kerrang Interviews |publisher=Klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com |date=December 10, 1993 |access-date=February 23, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108161123/http://klassickerranginterviews.weebly.com/matthew-trippe---may-1988.html |archive-date=January 8, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1989, McGhee was fired after the band alleged he had broken several promises that he made in relation to the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]], including giving his other band, [[Bon Jovi]], advantages in terms of slot placement.

The band spent the fall of 1989 and most of 1990 on a massive world tour, the band's biggest to that point. It was a major financial success but left the band feeling burnt out.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Motley Crue Hit a New Peak With 'Dr. Feelgood' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-dr-feelgood/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=March 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329144907/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-dr-feelgood/ |url-status=live}}</ref> In April 1990, Lee suffered a concussion during a mishap involving a rappelling drum kit stunt during a live concert in [[New Haven, Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Motley Crue Drummer Injured During Concert |url=https://www.apnews.com/e06e3e42abb126a5f147b7109ad97de5 |website=Associated Press |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620183943/https://www.apnews.com/e06e3e42abb126a5f147b7109ad97de5 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On October 1, 1991, the band's first compilation album, ''[[Decade of Decadence 81-91]]'', was released. It peaked at No.&nbsp;2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart. It was reportedly designed as "just something for the fans" while the band worked on the next "all new" album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Decade of Decadence - Motley Crue |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/decade-of-decadence-mw0000265080/releases |website=Allmusic |access-date=June 15, 2019 |archive-date=June 26, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626224632/https://www.allmusic.com/album/decade-of-decadence-mw0000265080/releases |url-status=live}}</ref>

===1992–2003: Years of turmoil===
Vince Neil left the band in February 1992 following the release of the ''Decade of Decadence'' album, during a period in which most other prominent [[glam metal]] bands of the 1980s were breaking up or otherwise seeing their popularity decline significantly amid the advent of [[grunge]] and [[Alternative rock|alternative]] music. It remains unclear whether Neil was fired or quit the band. Sixx has long maintained that Neil quit, while Neil insists that he was fired. "Any band has its little spats," Neil observed in 2000, "and this one basically just stemmed from a bunch of 'fuck yous' in a rehearsal studio. It went from 'I quit' to 'You're fired' ... It was handled idiotically. The management just let one of the biggest bands in the world break up."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=We are lüdicröus! |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #12 |date=March 2000 |page=48}}</ref>

Although Mötley's [[Mötley Crüe (album)|self-titled]] March 1994 release made the ''Billboard'' top ten (#7), the album was a commercial failure. It also prompted negative reactions from many fans due to Neil's absence and its sound. Corabi suggested the band bring back Neil, believing the latter would always be seen as the voice of the band. This eventually resulted in his own firing in 1996.<ref>{{cite web |title=What John Corabi Learned From Being Fired by Motley Crue |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-corabi-fired-motley-crue/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616175554/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-corabi-fired-motley-crue/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Corabi spoke about his time with the band and his thoughts on the first record with Mötley Crüe.

Agreeing to "leave their egos at the door", the band released ''[[Generation Swine]]''. Although it debuted at No.&nbsp;4, and in spite of a live performance at the American Music Awards, the album was a commercial failure, due in part to lack of support from their label.<ref>{{cite web |title=When Motley Crue Brought Back Vince Neil for 'Generation Swine' |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-generation-swine/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=June 15, 2019 |archive-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616175557/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-generation-swine/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1998, Mötley's contractual ties with Elektra had expired, putting the band in total control of their future, including the ownership of the master recordings of all of their albums. Announcing the end of their relationship with Elektra, the band became one of the few groups to own and control their publishing and music catalog. They are one of only a handful of artists to own the masters to their material and reportedly did so by being the biggest pain they could be until Elektra got fed up and handed over the rights in order to get the band off their label.<ref>{{cite web |title=5 Brilliant Business Lessons From Mötley Crüe (Seriously!) |url=https://www.fastcompany.com/3031014/5-brilliant-business-lessons-from-moetley-cruee-seriously |website=Fast Company |date=May 28, 2014 |access-date=18 December 2019 |archive-date=December 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218155724/https://www.fastcompany.com/3031014/5-brilliant-business-lessons-from-moetley-cruee-seriously |url-status=live}}</ref> After leaving Elektra the band created their own label, [[Mötley Records]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Q&A: Motley Crue still calling its own shots |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/music-motley-dc-idUSN27297720080627 |website=Reuters |date=June 27, 2008 |access-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-date=June 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617131931/https://www.reuters.com/article/music-motley-dc-idUSN27297720080627 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1999, Lee quit to pursue a solo career, due to increasing tensions with Neil. "All we got was a call from his attorney saying he wasn't coming back," recalled the singer. "He wasn't into rock 'n' roll anymore. He even said that rock is dead ... It all happened during a void in Mötley. We weren't even rehearsing, so it was no big deal."<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Dave |last=Ling |title=We are lüdicröus! |magazine=[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]] #12 |date=March 2000 |page=49}}</ref>

Lee was replaced by a longtime friend of the band, former [[Ozzy Osbourne]] drummer [[Randy Castillo]].

===2004–2007: Reunion and renewed success===
[[File:Mötley Crüe - 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Nikki Sixx and Mick Mars performing onstage with Mötley Crüe, on June 14, 2005 in Glasgow, Scotland]]

A promoter in England, Mags Revell, began clamoring for a Mötley Crüe reunion, ostensibly presenting himself as the voice of anxious fans waiting for more from the band.<ref>{{cite news |title=Motley Crue reunite for 2005 tour |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4074665.stm |work=BBC News |date=December 7, 2004 |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=January 3, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200103191042/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4074665.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> After meeting with management several times, in September 2004, Sixx announced that he and Neil had returned to the studio and had begun recording new material. In December 2004, the four original members announced a reunion tour, staging an announcement event in which they arrived at the Hollywood Palladium in a hearse.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motley Crue to Reunite for 2005 Tour, Album |url=https://www.foxnews.com/story/motley-crue-to-reunite-for-2005-tour-album |website=Fox News |date=March 25, 2015 |access-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621120757/https://www.foxnews.com/story/motley-crue-to-reunite-for-2005-tour-album |url-status=live}}</ref> The tour began on February 14, 2005, in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite web |title=MOTLEY CRUE To Kick Off Reunion Tour In San Juan, Puerto Rico |url=http://bravewords.com/news/motley-crue-to-kick-off-reunion-tour-in-san-juan-puerto-rico |website=Bravewords.com |access-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-date=June 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190621120801/http://bravewords.com/news/motley-crue-to-kick-off-reunion-tour-in-san-juan-puerto-rico |url-status=live}}</ref> The resulting compilation album, ''[[Red, White & Crüe]]'', was released in February 2005. It features the band members' favorite original songs plus three new tracks, "[[If I Die Tomorrow]]", "[[Sick Love Song]]" (co-written by Sixx and [[James Michael]]), and a cover of [[the Rolling Stones]]' classic "[[Street Fighting Man]]". A small controversy was caused when it was suggested that neither Lee nor Mars played on the new tracks (duties were supposedly handled by [[The Vandals|Vandals]] drummer [[Josh Freese]]). However, a [[VH1]] documentary of the band's reunion later showed that Lee did indeed play on some of the tracks. The Japanese release of ''Red, White & Crüe'' includes an extra new track titled "I'm a Liar (and That's the Truth)". ''Red, White & Crüe'' charted at No.&nbsp;6 and has since gone platinum.<ref>{{cite web |title=RIAA Gold and Platinum |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Motley%20Crue |website=Recording Industry Association of America |access-date=June 16, 2019 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160142/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Motley%20Crue |url-status=live}}</ref>

On New Year's Eve 2004 the band appeared on a live episode of ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. Neil yelled an obscenity during the performance, leading to an [[FCC]] investigation.<ref>{{cite web |title=FCC probes profanity slip by Motley Crue on 'Leno' |url=https://www.sunjournal.com/2005/01/05/fcc-probes-profanity-slip-motley-crue-leno/ |website=Sun Journal |date=January 5, 2005 |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=February 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210202225705/https://www.sunjournal.com/2005/01/05/fcc-probes-profanity-slip-motley-crue-leno/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[NBC]] network responded by banning the band, leading to the band subsequently suing the network, claiming they were being unfairly punished.<ref>{{cite web |title=Motley Crue sues NBC |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/motley-crue-sues-nbc/ |website=CBS News |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620133925/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/motley-crue-sues-nbc/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court and the band made several subsequent appearances on the network.<ref>{{cite web |title=When Motley Crue Sued NBC Over a Network Ban |url=https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-nbc-ban/ |website=Ultimate Classic Rock |access-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-date=June 20, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190620133923/https://ultimateclassicrock.com/motley-crue-nbc-ban/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

On June 11, 2008, Mötley Crüe and manager Burt Stein filed suit against each other. Stein was Neil's personal manager and also, according to the band and rival manager Kovac, served as the band's manager at one time. The band and Kovac sued in Los Angeles County Superior Court, claiming Stein was not entitled to a cut of Mötley Crüe's earnings. Stein sued the same day in Nashville's federal court, saying he was entitled to 1.875 percent of what the band makes.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wood |first=E. Thomas |author-link=E.
