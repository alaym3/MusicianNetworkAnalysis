'''Kool & the Gang''' is an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[funk]] band formed in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], in 1964 by brothers [[Robert "Kool" Bell]] and [[Ronald Bell (musician)|Ronald Bell]], with Dennis "Dee Tee" Thomas, Robert "Spike" Mickens, [[Claydes Charles Smith|Charles Smith]], George Brown, and Ricky West. They have undergone numerous changes in personnel and have explored many musical styles throughout their history, including [[jazz]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[funk]], [[Rock music|rock]], and [[pop music]]. After settling on their name following several changes, the group signed to [[De-Lite Records]] and released their debut album, ''[[Kool and the Gang (album)|Kool and the Gang]]'' (1969).

The band's first taste of success came with the release of their fourth album ''[[Wild and Peaceful (Kool & the Gang album)|Wild and Peaceful]]'' (1973), which contained the US top-ten singles "[[Jungle Boogie]]"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/jungle-boogie-mt0027175749|title=Jungle Boogie – Kool & the Gang |website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=June 27, 2019}}</ref> and "[[Hollywood Swinging]]". Kool & the Gang subsequently entered a period of decline before they reached a second commercial peak between 1979 and 1986 following their partnership with Brazilian musician/producer [[Eumir Deodato]] and the addition of singer [[James "J.T." Taylor]] to the line-up. Their most successful albums of this period include ''[[Ladies' Night (album)|Ladies' Night]]'' (1979), ''[[Celebrate!]]'' (1980), and ''[[Emergency (Kool & the Gang album)|Emergency]]'' (1984), their highest selling album with two million copies sold in the US. Their hit singles during this period included "[[Ladies' Night (song)|Ladies' Night]]", the US No. 1 "[[Celebration (Kool & the Gang song)|Celebration]]", "[[Get Down on It]]", "[[Joanna (Kool & the Gang song)|Joanna]]", "[[Misled (Kool & the Gang song)|Misled]]", and "[[Cherish (Kool & the Gang song)|Cherish]]". The band continues to perform worldwide, including as support for [[Van Halen]] in 2012 and their fiftieth-anniversary tour in 2014.

Kool & the Gang have won numerous awards, including two [[Grammy Award]]s, seven [[American Music Award]]s, and, in 2006, a [[Music Business Association]] Chairman's Award for artistic achievement. As well the band has been inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]] and been bestowed with a [[Mobo Award]] for Outstanding Achievement, the [[2014 Soul Train Music Awards|Soul Train Legend Award]], the [[Marian Anderson Award]] and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. During 2018, the Bells, Brown, and Taylor were also inducted into the [[Songwriters Hall of Fame]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.songhall.org/news/view/songwriters_hall_of_fame_announces_2018_inductees |title=Songwriters Hall Of Fame Announces 2018 Inductees – Songwriters Hall of Fame |website=Songhall.org |access-date=May 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508084548/https://www.songhall.org/news/view/songwriters_hall_of_fame_announces_2018_inductees |archive-date=May 8, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=MarianAndersonAward>{{cite web |url=https://whyy.org/articles/kool-and-the-gang-celebrate-getting-the-marian-anderson-award/|title=Kool & The Gang's 'Celebration' at the Marian Anderson Award ceremony|author=Crimmins, Peter|date=November 13, 2019|publisher=[[PBS]]|website=whyy.org}}</ref><ref name=MoboAward /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://njhalloffame.org/hall-of-famers/2015-inductees/kool-and-the-gang/|title=KOOL & THE GANG|publisher=[[New Jersey Hall of Fame]]|website=njhalloffame.org|date=June 26, 2015}}</ref>  Their [[Kool & the Gang discography|discography]] includes 23 studio albums and almost 70 singles.

== History ==
=== 1964–1969: Formation ===
The band formed in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], in 1964 when seven school friends decided to perform together as an instrumental jazz and soul group named the Jazziacs.<ref name=atlanticweekly2012 /> Among them were [[Robert "Kool" Bell]] on bass, his brother [[Ronald Bell (musician)|Ronald Bell]] on keyboards,<ref name=NJmonthly2014>{{cite web |url=https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/robert-kool-bell/ |title=Robert "Kool" Bell: The Gang Plays On |magazine=New Jersey Monthly |date=June 12, 2014 |first=Jack |last=Silbert |access-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404073350/https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/robert-kool-bell/ |archive-date=April 4, 2018 }}</ref> Robert "Spike" Mickens on trumpet, Dennis "D.T."

Their first gigs took place as the opening act to a weekly jazz night held in a local theatre every Sunday.<ref name=NJmonthly2014 /> They also played occasionally with [[McCoy Tyner]], [[Pharoah Sanders]], and [[Leon Thomas]] during their early period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amentertainment.com/artist-booking/kool-and-the-gang |title=Kool & The Gang – Booking A&M Entertainment |publisher=A&M Entertainment |access-date=June 18, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819202011/http://www.amentertainment.com/artist-booking/kool-and-the-gang |archive-date=August 19, 2014 }}</ref> The group then underwent several name changes, including The Soul Town Band and The New Dimensions,{{sfn|Hoffmann|2005|p=156}}{{sfn|Romanowski|George-Warren|Pareles|2001|p=538}} during which they would play [[Motown]] covers as the backing musicians for Soul Town, a small Jersey City-based organization similar to Motown.<ref name=soulsurvivors /> In 1967, they decided to perform as their own identity and became regulars at the Blue Note Lounge in Jersey; one of the MC's advertised them with a new name, Kool & the Flames. However, their manager Gene Redd advised against it to avoid confusion with [[James Brown]]'s band, [[The Famous Flames]], leading to a further change to Kool & the Gang, in 1969.<ref name=RS2009>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolthegang/biography |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821005118/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/koolthegang/biography |title=Kool & the Gang – Biography |archive-date=August 21, 2009 |first=Geoff |last=Himes |url-status=dead |work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

=== 1969–1972: Signing with De-Lite and early albums ===
After securing their new name and line-up, Kool & the Gang secured a recording deal with Redd's new independent label, [[De-Lite Records]]. Redd wrote: "I discovered these eight supertalented incomparable young musicians [...] I immediately realized that their potential would earn them success unknown by most musicians".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Kool and the Gang |year=1969 |publisher=De-Lite Records |url=https://www.discogs.com/Kool-The-Gang-Kool-And-The-Gang/release/531609 |id=DE-2003 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408074203/https://www.discogs.com/Kool-The-Gang-Kool-And-The-Gang/release/531609 |archive-date=April 8, 2018 }}</ref> The group entered the studio and recorded their debut album, the all-instrumental ''[[Kool and the Gang (album)|Kool and the Gang]]'' (1970), with Redd as a producer, arranger, conductor, and partial songwriter. It is their only album with guitarist Woody Sparrow who completed a temporary eight-man formation.<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Kool and the Gang |year=1969 |publisher=P&C Records |url=https://www.discogs.com/Kool-And-The-Gang-Kool-And-The-Gang/release/5843743 |id=PCD-72015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408073706/https://www.discogs.com/Kool-And-The-Gang-Kool-And-The-Gang/release/5843743 |archive-date=April 8, 2018 }}</ref> The album peaked at No. 46 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart. Around this time, the group began to develop their stage performance after they witnessed a set by Willie Feaster and the Mighty Magnificents which, according to Robert Bell, "Blew us away [...] We thought, 'Wow, if we want to be in show business, we have to change our act. We can't just stand up there and play'."<ref name=NJmonthly2014 />

The band followed their debut with two live albums: ''[[Live at the Sex Machine]]'', recorded the year before, and ''[[Live at PJ's]]'', both released in 1971. They returned to the studio in 1972 to record ''[[Music Is the Message]]'', released in July 1972, which went to No. 25 on the R&B chart. It was quickly followed by ''[[Good Times (Kool & the Gang album)|Good Times]]'' in November, which features the band backed by a string section. The elements of jazz, rock, and instrumental styles on the record made it difficult for reviewers to label them as one specific genre.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/4545308/ |title=Kool and the Gang has no set mold |first=William D. |last=Laffler |date=March 3, 1973 |newspaper=Naugatuck Daily News |page=6 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408210019/https://www.newspapers.com/image/4545308/ |archive-date=April 8, 2018 }}</ref>

=== 1973–1978: Rise to fame and low period ===
Kool & the Gang had their first commercial success with their fourth studio album ''[[Wild and Peaceful (Kool & the Gang album)|Wild and Peaceful]]'', which gave the band three more hits: "Funky Stuff" in the Top 40 pop chart and "[[Jungle Boogie]]" and "[[Hollywood Swinging]]" in the Top 10.<ref name="Bush">{{cite web |last1=Bush |first1=John |title=Kool & the Gang – Biography & History |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kool-the-gang-mn0000777210/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=October 23, 2016 |url-status=live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161106081009/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/kool-the-gang-mn0000777210/biography |archive-date=November 6, 2016}}</ref> The latter two songs sold over one million copies and were certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ([[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]).<ref name="Murrells">{{cite book |last1=Murrells |first1=Joseph |title=The book of golden discs |date=1978 |publisher=Barrie & Jenkins |location=London |isbn=0-214-20512-6 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330 330, 346] |edition=New and completely revised |url=https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/330 }}</ref> Their success continued with ''[[Light of Worlds]]'' (1974) In October 1974, the group landed a spot on the national television music show ''[[Soul Train]]''.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/54517802/ |title=Soul Train |date=October 24, 1974 |newspaper=Suburbanite Economist |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=8 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043031/https://www.newspapers.com/image/54517802/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref> In 1975, Kool & the Gang released ''[[Spirit of the Boogie]]''.

In 1976, Kool & the Gang entered a period of commercial decline following the rise of disco music in the charts. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Geoff Himes wrote the disco-era "frowned on [their] loose and greasy approach to dance music."<ref name=RS2009 /> This was demonstrated by the band's three albums released during this time, ''[[Open Sesame (Kool & the Gang album)|Open Sesame]]'' (1976), ''[[The Force (Kool & the Gang album)|The Force]]'' (1977), and ''[[Everybody's Dancin']]'' (1978). Robert Bell said De-Lite Records had built the group's own recording studio in Philadelphia.<ref name=lassen1977>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/75222961/ |title=The Kool Gang: A guitar, a dream, recruitment |first=Kurt |last=Lassen |date=July 16, 1977 |newspaper=Nashua Telegraph |page=15 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043214/https://www.newspapers.com/image/75222961/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref> Bell later spoke of these albums: "It bent our style a bit and we didn't feel at home with it".<ref name=lassen1979>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/288156908/ |title=Under 20 profile: Kool and the Gang |first=Kurt |last=Lassen |date=November 1, 1979 |newspaper=The News Leader |location=Stanton, Virginia |page=23 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043148/https://www.newspapers.com/image/288156908/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref> ''The Force'' and ''Everybody's Dancin{{'}}'' displayed the group's attempt to adopt disco elements with featured female vocalists and a string section, but Robert Bell later said: "We got too fancy and over-creative [...] We got away from the basic Kool & the Gang sound [...] and the public didn't like it". The change in style affected their ability to secure as many dates than before, working "just off and on" during this time.<ref name=lassen1977 /><ref name=latimes1980>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/385357909/ |title=Kool's kool – really cool |first=Dennis |last=Hunt |date=March 2, 1980 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |page=84 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409043056/https://www.newspapers.com/image/385357909/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref> The latter album received negative responses; one review for ''Everybody's Dancin{{'}}'' had the headline: "Kool and the Gang have gone bland." Writer Mike Duffy wrote: "They've joined the disco lemmings [...] The edge has gone. Say so long to the raw and raunchy."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/98871970/ |title=Kool and his gang have gone bland |first=Mike |last=Duffy |date=December 31, 1978 |newspaper=Detroit Free Press |page=26 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408210002/https://www.newspapers.com/image/98871970/ |archive-date=April 8, 2018 }}</ref>

During their low period, the band gained some mainstream attention with their contribution of "Open Sesame" to the [[Saturday Night Fever (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] of ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977).<ref name=lassen1979 /> "[[Summer Madness (instrumental)|Summer Madness]]" was also used in ''[[Rocky]]'' (1976), but not released on its soundtrack album.<ref name=lassen1979 />

To help their situation, Kool & the Gang changed musical direction in two distinct ways. After several years of consideration, they decided to bring in a dedicated lead vocalist to become more of a focal point to their music, at the suggestion of promoter turned [[SOLAR Records]] founder [[Dick Griffey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Chris |title=Key Tracks: Kool & the Gang's "Ladies Night" |url=https://daily.redbullmusicacademy.com/2015/02/key-tracks-kool-and-the-gang-ladies-night |website=redbullmusicacademy.com |publisher=Red Bull Music Academy |access-date=June 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Hurtt |first1=Edd |title=Kool and the Gang's Robert 'Kool' Bell: The Cream Interview |url=https://www.nashvillescene.com/music/article/13042881/kool-and-the-gangs-robert-kool-bell-the-cream-interview |website=nashvillescene.com |publisher=Nashville Scene |access-date=June 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Lynch |first1=Joe |title=Kool & the Gang Look Back on 50 Years of Funk |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8498675/kool-and-the-gang-50-years-interview |magazine=Billboard  |access-date=June 24, 2019}}</ref> By 1979, South Carolina-born singer [[James "J.T."

In September 1980, the band released its second collaborative album with Deodato, ''[[Celebrate!]]''. It became a bigger commercial success than ''Ladies' Night''; the lead single "[[Celebration (Kool & the Gang song)|Celebration]]" remains the band's only single to reach No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart. The song originated from the lyric "Come on, let's all celebrate" from "Ladies' Night" which inspired Robert Bell to write a song that he described as "an international anthem."<ref name=RS2009 /><ref name="Hanson" /> The band developed the song on a tour bus after attending the [[American Music Award]]s.<ref name=variety2015>{{cite web |url=https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-3842729011/gang-s-still-kool-after-all-these-years |first=Malina |last=Saval |title=Gang's Still Kool After All These Years |work=Variety |date=October 6, 2015 |via= |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404140035/https://www.questia.com/read/1P3-3842729011/gang-s-still-kool-after-all-these-years |archive-date=April 4, 2018 }}</ref> The song was used in national media coverage for the [[1980 World Series]], the [[Super Bowl XV|1981 Super Bowl]], the [[1981 NBA Finals]], and the [[Iran hostage crisis|1981 return of the Iran hostages]].<ref name=RS2009 />

After the release of ''[[Something Special (Kool & the Gang album)|Something Special]]'' (1981), which continued the level of success of the previous two albums, the band recorded their fourth and final album with Deodato, ''[[As One (Kool & the Gang album)|As One]]'' (1982). The latter struggled to reach gold certification in the US, which led to the band's decision to end their time with Deodato as they had enough with the direction they had adopted.<ref name=hunt1985 /> They then decided to produce their next album, ''[[In the Heart]]'' (1983), by themselves with Jim Bonnefond as co-producer. The album contained the US top-five single "[[Joanna (Kool & the Gang song)|Joanna]]". The song was declared the most-played pop song in 1984 by Broadcast Music International.<ref name=dispatch1987 /> Bonnefond stayed with the group for ''[[Emergency (Kool & the Gang album)|Emergency]]'' (1984), which remains their highest selling album with over two million copies sold in the US. It spawned four US top 20 singles, including "Emergency", "[[Cherish (Kool & the Gang song)|Cherish]]", "[[Fresh (Kool & the Gang song)|Fresh]]", and "Misled". This feat made Kool & the Gang the only band to have four top 20 singles from a single album in 1985.<ref name=arizona1987>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/120928809/ |title=Kool & The Gang return to Caesars Thursday |first=Charlotte A. |last=Clark |date=March 15, 1987 |newspaper=Arizona Republic |page=81 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409044118/https://www.newspapers.com/image/120928809/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref>

In June 1984, Kool & the Gang took time off from recording ''Emergency'' to perform at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] as part of a sold-out summer concert organised by [[Elton John]].<ref name=arizona1987 /> That November, during a visit to [[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]]'s offices in London, [[Bob Geldof]] arrived to pitch his idea of the multi-artist charity single "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" to the label. Kool & the Gang participated in the project.<ref name=arizona1987 />{{sfn|Ure|2013}}

In 1985, Bell said the band retained control of their own business affairs, avoiding to hire management on a full-time basis and preferring to hire consultants and agents for each project or a single term.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/140889729 |title=Kool & The Gang making the '80s their own |first=David |last=Surkamp |date=June 6, 1985 |newspaper=St. Louis Post-Dispatch |location=St. Louis, Missouri |pages=23–24 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409110126/http://www.newspapers.com/image/140889729/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref>

The group's seventeenth album, ''[[Forever (Kool & the Gang album)|Forever]]'', was released in November 1986. The album included two hit singles on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart: "Victory" (US #10, R&B #2) and "[[Stone Love (song)|Stone Love]]" (US #10, R&B #4). Two further singles, "Holiday" and "Special Way" were also released from the album; the former reached the top ten on the R&B Chart, the latter hit reached No. 6 on the Adult Contemporary chart.<ref>{{AllMusic |class=album |id=r11168 |tab=charts-awards/billboard-single |label="Forever > Charts & Awards > Billboard Singles" |access-date=October 31, 2011}}</ref> By 1986, the band had scored 14 top 40 singles in the US since 1980, more than [[Michael Jackson]].<ref name=ebony1986>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDAAAAMBAJ&q=Kool%20Gang%20Jazziacs&pg=PA72 |title=Kool & the Gang – Hottest Groupof the 80s |first=Lynn |last=Norment |date=November 1986 |magazine=Ebony |issn=0012-9011 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=72, 74, 76 |access-date=April 3, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180404073645/https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA74&dq=Kool%20Gang%20Jazziacs&pg=PA72#v=onepage&q&f=false |archive-date=April 4, 2018 }}</ref> In July 1986, the band recorded a special version of "Celebration" with different vocals that was used in an advertisement for [[Wendy's]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dougherty|first=Philip H.|date=June 26, 1986|title=Advertising; Wendy's Spot Created By Lockhardt & Pettus|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/business/advertising-wendy-s-spot-created-by-lockhardt-pettus.html|access-date=May 13, 2021|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In 1987, the band completed a 50-city tour of the US. The tour included the group establishing their own public service program, devised by Robert Bell and Taylor, which encouraged school children to pursue education, giving free tickets to those with perfect attendance.<ref name=henderson1987>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/145111497/ |title=Kool gangs up on area concert scene |first=Marguerite |last=Henderson |date=June 26, 1987 |newspaper=Asbury Park Press |page=64 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409044434/https://www.newspapers.com/image/145111497/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref> The group rehearsed their stage show with a choreographer at Prince's studio at [[Paisley Park]].<ref name=courier1987 /> At the time of the tour's start, the band ceased producing adverts with Schlitz beer because of their new image towards children and that they felt it had run its course.<ref name=dispatch1987>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/340416621/ |title=Kool & Gang tries to win over kids |first=John D. |last=Gonzalez |newspaper=The Dispatch |page=65 |date=July 19, 1987 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 14, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180415063255/https://www.newspapers.com/image/340416621/ |archive-date=April 15, 2018 }}</ref> After the tour, Taylor left Kool & the Gang to pursue a solo career. He returned in 1996 for their ''[[State of Affairs (Kool & the Gang album)|State of Affairs]]'' album.

=== 1988–present: Later career ===
In February 1988, news of Taylor's departure from the band to pursue a solo career was reported in the press.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/154924435/ |title=Kool's Taylor leaves |date=February 21, 1988 |newspaper=The Akron Beacon Journal |page=15 |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |url-access=subscription  |access-date=April 8, 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180409044458/https://www.newspapers.com/image/154924435/ |archive-date=April 9, 2018 }}</ref><ref name=RS2009 /> The group had discussed pursuing solo projects during the previous year, with Thomas suggesting the band had considered splitting into twos or threes.<ref name=dispatch1987 /> Taylor was replaced by three vocalists: [[Sennie "Skip" Martin]], Odeen Mays, and Gary Brown.

1989 saw the release of the band's 18th album ''[[Sweat (Kool & the Gang album)|Sweat]]''. By this time [[Ronald Bell (musician)|Khalis Bayyan]] and Robert "Spike" Mickens also had departed the band. The album didn't fare well. Ron Wynn of Allmusic called the album "a completely faceless, aimless record&nbsp;... probably the worst album of their career."<ref name="Wynn">{{cite web |title= Review of ''Sweat'' |last=Wynn |first=Ron |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sweat-mw0000200178 |work=AllMusic |access-date=March 25, 2021}}</ref> ''[[Unite (Kool & the Gang album)|Unite]]'', the band's nineteenth studio album, was released in 1992. It marked the return of Khalis Bayyan to the group. In 1995, Taylor returned to the band for ''[[State of Affairs (Kool & the Gang album)|State of Affairs]]'' (1996), hailed as the group's "comeback" album.<ref name=RS2009 /> All songs on this album were written by Khalis Bayyan and Taylor. Taylor left the band for the second time in 1999.

On their next studio album ''[[Gangland (album)|Gangland]]'' (2001), Kool & the Gang pursued elements of hip hop. The album was a compilation of rappers backed by Kool and the Gang remaking some of the band's songs. During 2003 the band was bestowed with a [[Mobo Award]] for Outstanding Achievement.<ref name=MoboAward>{{cite web|url=https://www.mobo.com/history/2003|title=2003 MOBO Awards|publisher=[[MOBO Awards]]|website=mobo.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OBYA7ekRBO0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/OBYA7ekRBO0| archive-date=2021-11-07 | url-status=live|title=Kool & The Gang 'Outstanding Achievement' Acceptance Speech 2003|date=September 12, 2014|publisher=[[MOBO Awards]]|website=youtube.com}}{{cbignore}}</ref>  2004 saw the release of yet another album featuring remakes and some new songs.

In 2012, Bell accepted [[Van Halen]] singer [[David Lee Roth]]'s invitation for Kool & the Gang to be the opening act during their [[A Different Kind of Truth Tour]] as Roth had noticed a significant portion of their concert audience were women.
