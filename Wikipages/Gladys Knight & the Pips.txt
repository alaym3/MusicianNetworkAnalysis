'''Gladys Knight & the Pips''' were an American [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]]/[[soul music|soul]]/[[funk]] family [[music group]] from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], that remained active on the music charts and performing circuit for over three decades.

Starting out as simply '''The Pips''' in 1952, derived from a cousin's nickname, the founding members were [[Gladys Knight]], brother [[Bubba Knight|Merald "Bubba" Knight]], sister Brenda Knight and cousins Eleanor Guest and [[William Guest (singer)|William Guest]]. After a couple of years performing in talent shows, the group signed with [[Brunswick Records]] in 1957, recording a couple of singles that failed to chart. Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest eventually left the group and were replaced by another cousin, [[Edward Patten]], and a non-relative, Langston George in 1959. This lineup produced the group's first hit single, "[[Every Beat of My Heart (song)|Every Beat of My Heart]]". After the single was released on three different labels, they changed their name to ''Gladys Knight & the Pips'' in 1961. Langston George left the same year and Gladys Knight left in 1962 to start a family with musician Jimmy Newman. Knight rejoined in 1964 and this lineup continued until the group's disbandment in 1989.

The group reached commercial success after signing with [[Motown Records]] in 1966. After a year and a half, the group recorded the first hit single version of "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]" in 1967, which led to several hit singles for Motown's Soul Records label, including "[[Nitty Gritty (song)|Nitty Gritty]]", "Friendship Train", "[[If I Were Your Woman (song)|If I Were Your Woman]]", "[[I Don't Want to Do Wrong]]" and the Grammy-winning "[[Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)]]", before leaving the label for [[Buddah Records]] in 1973.  At Buddah, they recorded the hits "[[You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me|Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me]]", "[[I've Got to Use My Imagination]]", "[[I Feel a Song (In My Heart)]]" and their Grammy-winning and number-one hit single, "[[Midnight Train to Georgia]]". In 1974, they recorded the [[Claudine (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the successful film ''[[Claudine (film)|Claudine]]'' with producer [[Curtis Mayfield]], which included the songs "[[On and On (Gladys Knight & the Pips song)|On and On]]", "The Makings of You" and "Make Yours a Happy Home".  Contractual difficulties with their labels forced the group to record side projects from 1977 until 1980 when they signed with [[Columbia Records]]. Later hits included "Landlord", "[[Save the Overtime (For Me)]]" and the Grammy-winning single "[[Love Overboard]]". In 1989, the group disbanded with the Pips retiring and Knight embarking on a successful solo career.

Gladys Knight & the Pips are multiple [[Grammy]] and [[American Music Award]] winners and are inductees into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/gladys-knight-and-the-pips/bio/ |title=Gladys Knight and the Pips Biography |publisher=The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum |access-date=18 August 2015}}</ref> and the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 1996 and 2001 respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/gladys_knight_pips.html |title=Gladys Knight and the Pips – Inductees |publisher=The Vocal Group Hall of Fame Foundation |access-date=18 August 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304114828/http://www.vocalgroup.org/inductees/gladys_knight_pips.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

==History==
===Early years===
Gladys Knight performed on [[Ted Mack (radio-TV host)|Ted Mack]]'s ''Original Amateur Hour'' in 1952 at the age of eight, winning first prize. On September 4, 1952, Gladys, Bubba, sister Brenda and their cousins William and Eleanor Guest began performing together during Bubba's tenth birthday party after a record player malfunctioned. Shortly afterwards, the quintet agreed to form a group under the insistence of Gladys' mother Elizabeth Knight. They settled on the name The Pips,<ref name="LarkinSM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Soul Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1993|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-733-9|pages=151/3}}</ref> inspired by the nickname of their cousin James "Pip" Woods. By 1955, the group began performing on the talent show circuit in their hometown of Atlanta, winning each talent show they entered. This success allowed them to get a record contract with [[Brunswick Records]] in 1957.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> At Brunswick, the group released two recordings that failed to chart. Despite this, the group was now opening for top recording acts such as [[Jackie Wilson]] and [[Sam Cooke]].

By 1959, Brunswick dropped the group and both Brenda Knight and Eleanor Guest left the group to begin families.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> They were replaced by another cousin, Edward Patten, and a friend, Langston George.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Patten and George were involved in another group before joining the Pips. In 1961, they recorded the [[Johnny Otis]]-penned "[[Every Beat of My Heart (song)|Every Beat of My Heart]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Because the group was without a record label, a local Atlanta label, Huntom Records, pushed the single and got a distribution deal with [[Vee-Jay Records]] to release the single.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> During this time, the group moved to New York where they auditioned for [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]]'s [[Fury Records]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Upon learning that "Every Beat of My Heart" was already becoming a hit and cutting the group out of profits, Robinson had the group re-record the song and re-release it on Fury Records.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Both versions made the Billboard charts, with the Huntom/Vee-Jay version reaching number six on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Prior to the re-release on Fury Records, the group changed their name to Gladys Knight & the Pips.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/Gladys-Knight-And-The-Pips-Every-Beat-Of-My-Heart/master/386761 Gladys Knight And The Pips – Every Beat Of My Heart], Discogs.com</ref> Later in 1961, the newly christened quintet released the single, "[[Letter Full of Tears]]", which became another top 40 hit in early 1962.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> After a string of single releases on Fury Records, Langston George left the group in 1962.<ref name="Langston George obituary">{{cite web |url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/atlanta/obituary.aspx?n=langston-george&pid=86892888 |title=Langston George obituary |work=Legacy.com |date=22 March 2007 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>

The group's success was halted by Gladys Knight's sudden departure in 1962 to start a family with husband Jimmy Newman, a musician. Knight gave birth to the couple's son James Gaston Newman III in August 1962. A daughter, Kenya Maria Newman, was born in November 1963. During this period, the Pips kept performing and recording to little fanfare, and eventually each Pip took odd jobs while Gladys Knight began performing solo with Newman, now her musical director. Eventually Gladys reunited with the Pips and signed with a local New York label, Maxx Records, that year.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> During that time, Newman served as the group's musical director. During this period, the group were mentored by Maurice King and [[Cholly Atkins|Cholly "Pops" Atkins]]; their association with King going back to the group's early years traveling to Detroit. The group recorded a third top 40 single with [[Van McCoy]]'s "[[Giving Up]]".  Other notable songs they released on Maxx include "Lovers Always Forgive", "(There Will Never Be) Another Love", "Either Way I Lose", "Go Away, Stay Away", "Maybe Maybe Baby", ""Stop and Get a Hold of Myself", "Who Knows? (I Just Can't Trust You)" and "If I Should Ever Fall in Love".

The group developed a reputation for exciting and polished live performances, that enabled them to work even without the benefit of best-selling records. Choreographer Atkins designed "fast-stepping" dance routines that became a signature of the Pips' stage presentation; Atkins later described his working and personal relationship with the group in his autobiography, ''Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins'': "The one thing that I was pleased about was a stipulation in my contract that allowed me to keep working with Gladys Knight & the Pips as personal clients even though I would be an employee of Motown Records. To tell the truth, Gordy wasn't too happy about it at first, but this is something that I would not compromise under any circumstances. By that time, Gladys and the guys were like my own children!"<ref>''Class Act: The Jazz Life of Choreographer Cholly Atkins''(pg. 148).

[[Image:Gladys-pips-everybody-needs-luv.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Gladys Knight & the Pips' [[Motown]] long-playing debut, ''[[Everybody Needs Love (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Everybody Needs Love]]'' (1967), which includes their hit single "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]".]]

===Gladys Knight & the Pips join Motown Records===
By the end of 1965, [[Berry Gordy]] was scouting to get the group signed to his [[Motown]] label. Knight initially refused to sign due to her fears that the label would overlook them for the more popular artists on his roster, but she was outvoted by the Pips. They would sign with Motown in 1966, being assigned to Motown's Soul Records label, a label which featured acts who had more of an R&B flavor than a pop one. Their first Motown single, "Just Walk in My Shoes", was a hit in the UK, but the group was disappointed in Motown having [[The Andantes]] sing over the Pips' signature [[Vocal harmony|harmony]] in the song, resulting in the group demanding that the Andantes not be featured on any more of the group's recordings. They also were one of the few Motown acts that did not regularly perform on the label's Motortown Revues, with an exception being a Christmas showcase at the Fox Theater in Detroit, recorded for the album, ''Motortown Revue Live''. A second single, "Take Me in Your Arms and Love Me", also reached the charts in the UK.

Their third single, "[[Everybody Needs Love (Temptations song)|Everybody Needs Love]]", became the group's first American charted single in two years, reaching number 39 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number three R&B after its release in 1967. On the [[A&E Network]] television program ''[[Biography (television program)|Biography]]'', Knight stated that she and the Pips were regarded as a second-string act, and that "[[The Supremes|Diana (Ross) & the Supremes]], [[The Temptations]], and [[Marvin Gaye]] were given all the hits, while we took the leftovers." In Knight's autobiography, ''Between Each Line of Pain and Glory: My Life Story'',<ref>Knight, Gladys (1997). ''Between Each Line of Pain and Glory: My Life Story''. New York: Hyperion Press.  {{ISBN|0-7868-6326-9}}.</ref> she stated that [[Diana Ross]] had the group removed from being The Supremes' opening act on a 1968 tour for, according to Knight, being 'too good'. The group finally scored a career breakthrough with their fourth Motown single, "[[I Heard It Through the Grapevine]]", which reached number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number one on the R&B chart.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The group's recording became Motown's best-selling single ever to that point, selling over 2.5&nbsp;million copies.<ref>George, Nelson (1985, rev. 2003). ''Where Did Our Love Go: The Rise and Fall of the Motown''. London: Omnibus Press.  {{ISBN|0-7119-9511-7}}.</ref> [[Marvin Gaye]]'s version of the song, released in 1968, outsold the group's version, selling four million copies and reaching number one on the Hot 100. While at Motown in 1968, Knight was the first person to suggest that [[Berry Gordy]] sign the up-and-coming group called [[The Jackson Five]] (though [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers|Bobby Taylor]] of the Vancouvers also had a role), after appearing with them on a concert held in [[Gary, Indiana]], to help elect Mayor [[Richard Hatcher]], despite the claim that Diana Ross discovered them.

Following the success of "Grapevine", the group worked frequently with [[Norman Whitfield]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Whitfield produced them the hits, "[[The End of Our Road]]", "[[It Should Have Been Me (Norman Whitfield song)|It Should've Been Me]]", "Friendship Train", "[[Nitty Gritty (song)|Nitty Gritty]]" and "You Need Love Like I Do (Don't You)".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> They also recorded [[Ashford & Simpson]]'s "Didn't You Know (You'd Have To Cry Sometime)" in 1969. They scored their second million-selling Motown single with the ballad "[[If I Were Your Woman (song)|If I Were Your Woman]]" in 1970.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Another ballad, the self-composed "[[I Don't Want to Do Wrong]]", became another million-selling single. Both singles were featured on their first number one album, also titled ''If I Were Your Woman''. In late 1971, they released a soulful version of [[Kris Kristofferson]]'s "[[Help Me Make It Through the Night]]", which became an international hit. The group released the [[Jim Weatherly]] ballad, "[[Neither One of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)]]", in December 1972, the single would become their last single released while still with the label.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> While the single was charting, the group tried to negotiate a better contract with Motown.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Negotiations fell through weeks later and, in February 1973, the group left Motown and signed with [[Buddah Records]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QEUEAAAAMBAJ&q=Gladys+Knight+%26+The+Pips+Neither+One+Of+Us&pg=PT11 |title=Soul Sauce |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date=February 17, 1973 |access-date=January 10, 2016}}</ref> "Neither One of Us" became their biggest selling single at Motown, reaching number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and winning the group a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals|Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals]].

[[File:Gladys Knight 1974.jpg|thumb|Gladys Knight (1974)]]
===Taking the "Midnight Train" to Buddah Records===
Following the signing with Buddah Records, the label issued another Weatherly ballad, "Where Peaceful Waters Flow", released around the same time "Neither One of Us" and a Motown single, "Daddy Could Swear, I Declare", was charting. The song became a modest success as a result. The group reached its popular and critical peak soon afterwards, starting with the release of another Weatherly song, "[[Midnight Train to Georgia]]", in August 1973.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The song eventually hit number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and R&B singles charts, becoming their [[signature song]].

They followed that single with the release of the million-selling album, ''[[Imagination (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Imagination]]'', which released two more top ten singles, "[[I've Got to Use My Imagination]]" and "[[You're the Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me|Best Thing That Ever Happened to Me]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The release of ''Imagination'' sparked a consecutive series of million-selling albums for the label including the [[Claudine (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] to the movie, ''[[Claudine (film)|Claudine]]'';<ref name="LarkinSM"/> ''[[I Feel a Song]]'' and ''2nd Anniversary''.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1975, the group scored a mid-season variety series, ''The Gladys Knight & the Pips Show'', that aired for four episodes on NBC.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> During this time, the group recorded more hit singles, including "[[I Feel a Song (In My Heart)]]", "Part-Time Love", "Love Finds Its Own Way" and the live recording, "[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]/[[Try to Remember]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

By 1977, the group ran into contract disputes with both Motown and Buddah Records.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> After asking to be released from their contract from Buddah, the label forced the band to record side projects while the dispute was settled.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Between 1978 and 1980, Knight released two solo albums and the Pips released two side albums.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In a segment for [[Richard Pryor]]'s TV special, the Pips (minus Gladys) appeared on his show performing their backup verses for the songs "I Heard It Through the Grapevine" and "Midnight Train to Georgia"; during parts where Gladys would sing, the camera panned on a lone-standing microphone. The group still performed together during this period, which ended with the group signing with [[Columbia Records]] in 1980.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

===Later years and disbandment===
In 1980, having signed with Columbia, the group reunited with their old Motown collaborators Ashford & Simpson, recording and releasing the album, ''About Love'', which included the charted singles "Taste of Bitter Love", "Bourgie, Bourgie" and "Landlord".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> They continued the collaboration with the duo on their 1981 follow-up, ''Touch'', which included the single "I Will Fight", and a cover of "[[I Will Survive]]". Also in 1981, the group provided prominent backing vocals for [[Kenny Rogers]] on his remake of Bobby "Blue" Bland's "[[Share Your Love with Me]]". The group had appeared on Rogers' television show with the First Edition several times in the early 1970s, and Knight guested on Rogers' TV special, ''Kenny Rogers Classic Weekend'' in 1986, performing a duet of "Am I Too Late?", a song both singers had previously recorded. Three years later she also collaborated with Rogers on the US Billboard AC top ten single "If I Knew Then What I Know Now".

Following a year-long international tour, the group recorded their third Columbia album, ''[[Visions (Gladys Knight & the Pips album)|Visions]]'', in 1983.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The leading single, "[[Save the Overtime (For Me)]]", gave the group their first number one R&B single in eight years.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The video accompanying the song became among the earliest R&B videos to incorporate elements of hip-hop culture. The album also included the R&B hit "You're Number One (In My Book)".<ref name="LarkinSM"/>  After Knight partook in solo projects, including a No. 1 Billboard Hot 100 and R&B hit collaboration on the song, "[[That's What Friends Are For]]", the group signed with [[MCA Records]] and released their final album, ''All Our Love'', which was certified gold, and included the hits "Lovin' On Next to Nothin'" and their Grammy-winning number-one single, "[[Love Overboard]]".<ref name="LarkinSM"/> In 1988 the band also won a [[Soul Train Music Award for Heritage Award - Career Achievement|Soul Train Music Award for Career Achievement]]. Gladys Knight & the Pips embarked on their final tour in 1988 and disbanded upon its conclusion, as Knight decided she wanted to pursue a solo career, ending a 37-year tenure.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

===Honors, solo careers and deaths===
Following the group's amicable disbandment in 1989, Edward Patten and William Guest formed their own production company in Detroit, titled Guest and Patten Productions, later renamed the Crew Entertainment Company. Patten was diagnosed with [[diabetes]], which led to amputations of his legs and being confined to a wheelchair. He later died of complications from the disease on February 25, 2005, in [[Livonia, Michigan]]. William Guest continued to lead the company with members of Patten's family until his death from congestive heart failure in Detroit on December 24, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/entertainment/william-guest-a-member-of-gladys-knight-and-the-pips-dies-at-74-1.2714333 |title=William Guest, a member of Gladys Knight and the Pips, dies at 74 {{pipe}} Entertainment & Showbiz from CTV News |website=Ctvnews.ca |date=May 8, 2014 |access-date=26 December 2015}}</ref> Two years prior, Guest and his sister, Dame Dhyana Ziegler, PhD, released his autobiography, ''Midnight Train FROM Georgia: A Pip's Journey'' (Branden Books, Boston, MA, USA), about his life and career.

Bubba Knight still continues to oversee his sister's career, by being her tour manager and occasionally joining Gladys onstage during performances. Gladys Knight recorded the theme song for the [[James Bond]] film, ''[[Licence to Kill]]'' in 1989, which became a top ten single in the UK.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Two years later, she released her 1991 album, ''Good Woman'', which included the top five R&B hit, "Men", and Grammy-nominated duet version of "[[Superwoman]]", recorded with [[Dionne Warwick]] and [[Patti LaBelle]]. A 1994 album, ''Just for You'', featured the hits "I Don't Wanna Know" and her cover of [[Boyz II Men]]'s "End of the Road", and went gold. Knight still records and performs today. As a member of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], she sometimes leads the [[Saints Unified Voices]] choir.

The group was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1996, the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2001 and received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Rhythm & Blues Foundation in 1998. Gladys Knight & the Pips are ranked as the ninth most successful act in ''The Billboard Top 40 Book of R&B and Hip-Hop Hits'' (2005). They were also ranked No. 91 on [[VH1]]'s ''Top 100 Artists of Rock n' Roll''. In June 2006, Gladys Knight & the Pips were inducted into the [[Apollo Theater]]'s Hall of Fame in New York City. In 2017 the group was inducted into Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame.

On June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Gladys Knight & the Pips among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name="Rosen2">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |access-date=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>
