== History ==

=== Formation and ''Prepare Consume Proceed EP'' (2011–2016) ===
Loathe has its origins in the Liverpool [[melodic metalcore]] band Our Imbalance, which was founded by Erik Bickerstaffe. Kadeem France, who at that time was the drummer for Escapists UK, soon replaced Our Imbalance's founding vocalist Harry Rule.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mills |first1=Matt |title=Loathe: the future of British metal has arrived |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/loathe-the-future-of-british-metal-has-arrived |website=[[Metal Hammer]] |access-date=20 September 2021}}</ref> By 2014, the band also included drummer Sean Radcliffe. Around this time, Our Imbalance morphed into Loathe with the recruitment of guitarist Connor Sweeney and bassist Shayne Smith.<ref name="Law 2020">{{cite web |last1=Law |first1=Sam |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/loathe-face-to-face-with-the-unstoppable-future-of-british-metal/ |title=Loathe: Face to face with the unstoppable future of British metal |website=[[Kerrang!]] |access-date=20 September 2021}}</ref>

In 2015, they performed at Deadbolt Festival on 8 August, and in Autumn that same year they released their first EP titled "Prepare Consume Proceed" independently.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/51885/news-heart-of-a-coward-and-more-finalise-line-up-for-deadbolt-festival-2015|title=NEWS: Heart Of A Coward and more finalise line-up for Deadbolt Festival 2015!|work=DEAD PRESS! {{!}} Alternative music news, reviews, interviews and more!|access-date=12 May 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref name=":7">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalrockreview.com/artist-news/loathe-re-release-new-ep-prepare-consume-proceed|title=Loathe Re-Release New EP, Prepare Consume Proceed - National Rock Review|website=www.nationalrockreview.com|language=en-US|access-date=25 April 2018}}</ref><ref name=":2" /> The band initially kept their names anonymous, using stage names (DRK, DRT, SNK, MWL and NIL) along with not revealing their origin.

The 2021 instrumental album ''the Things They Believe'' also showcases the bands ability to create atmospheric sounds and sonic soundscapes with their use of expressionist, experimental, and synth heavy sounds, which has been compared to the works of [[Trent Reznor]] & [[Atticus Ross]], [[Vangelis]], and soundtracks to [[David Lynch]] films, described as noir-like electronic-ambience.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":33">{{Cite web|last=Morgan|first=Tom|date=2021-02-09|title=ALBUM REVIEW: Loathe - The Things They Believe|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/album-review-loathe-the-things-they-believe/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-25|website=DEAD PRESS! {{!}} It's more than "just music" to us|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Hill|first=Stephen|date=2021-02-08|title=Loathe’s The Things They Believe: Brit-metal hopefuls tear up the rulebook|url=https://www.loudersound.com/reviews/loathe-the-things-they-believe-album-review|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-25|website=Metal Hammer Magazine|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Price|first=Jeremy|date=2021-05-03|title=By using solely instrumentals, Loathe crafted the perfect meditation album|url=https://www.altpress.com/features/loathe-kadeem-france-the-things-they-believe/|access-date=2021-05-25|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Lyrical style ===
The band describes themselves as a conceptual band, as throughout all of their album releases they have been telling stories of fiction.<ref name=":17" /> Their first release, ''Prepare Consume Proceed'', was said to involve a story about a tormented protagonist, who loses a loved one and is later killed by the end of the EP's run.<ref name=":22">{{Cite news|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/63026/track-by-track-loathe-prepare-consume-proceed|title=TRACK-BY-TRACK: Loathe – Prepare Consume Proceed|work=DEAD PRESS! {{!}} Alternative music news, reviews, interviews and more!|access-date=12 May 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref> The studio album ''the Cold Sun'' tells a narrative of a violent post-apocalyptic setting, mixing themes of desolation with an overarching sense of positivity and heroism. The record supposedly tells a story of two protagonists who exist during this dystopian setting set up by in the album.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":13" /> Bickerstaffe has stated that they don't take influence from other major concept records and acts such as [[Thirty Seconds to Mars]] and [[Pink Floyd]], making the remark: "Our inspiration to create concept records mostly comes from wanting to create our own worlds within the music, almost like looking at the album as a book with separate chapters."<ref name=":17" />

For the second album, Bickerstaffe has stated that their writing process starts with the concept, which is spread out across 12 songs. Once they have a plan for what they want to create, they focus on sustaining those songs.<ref name=":19" />

=== Live performances ===
[[Metal Hammer]] and WhatCulture writer Matt Mills named the band 2018's greatest live metal act, stating that their presence on stage is "always intense and cinematic" whilst applauding the band's use of atmospheric, minimalist interludes inspired by film soundtracks.<ref name=":20">{{Cite web|url=http://whatculture.com/music/10-best-heavy-metal-live-bands-of-2018|title=10 Best Heavy Metal Live Bands Of 2018|last=Mills|first=Matt|date=26 November 2018|website=WhatCulture.com|language=en|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref> The band's lead vocalist Kadeem France utilised a prophetic mask of unknown significance, which was used as the album artwork for their EP.<ref name=":21" /> Bickerstaffe mentioned to [[Kerrang!]] that they "...take a lot of inspiration from Marvel, DC and the rest of the comic world - seeing our live shows like performance art." adding that "The mask is definitely a big part of that what we do, but it's not entirely everything."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sharma|first=Amit|date=8 April 2017|title=Fresh Blood, Rocks Breaking Bands: Loathe|url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/kerrang-uk/20170405/textview|journal=[[Kerrang!]]|issue=1665|pages=16|issn=0262-6624|url-access=limited|access-date=2 May 2018|via=[[PressReader]]}}</ref> Since 2016 however, the band has not used the mask, citing the gimmick to be influenced by major acts such as [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]] and [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], wearing it to pay homage to such bands.<ref name=":18" /> During the same year, Kerrang! writer Sam Law criticised the band's use of masks and then stage names in 2016, calling it "shittily clichéd".<ref name=":9" /> The use of TV screens on the stage is also utilised for the band's gritty, theatrical presence.<ref name=":20" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://distortedsoundmag.com/live-review-sikth-the-globe-cardiff/|title=LIVE REVIEW: SikTh @ The Globe, Cardiff|last=Leaver|first=Elliot|date=20 September 2018|website=Distorted Sound Magazine|language=en-US|access-date=10 December 2018}}</ref>

Major influences outside of the metal band scene are the soundtracks for ''[[Silent Hill 2]]'', composed by [[Akira Yamaoka]], and [[Akira (1988 film)|''Akira'']], composed by [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]], and the [[Blade Runner (soundtrack)|''Blade Runner'' soundtrack]] composed by [[Vangelis]].
