{{Property law}}

'''Real estate''' is property consisting of land and the buildings on it, along with its [[natural resource]]s such as crops, minerals or water; immovable property of this nature; an interest vested in this (also) an item of real property, (more generally) buildings or [[housing]] in general.<ref name="ReferenceA">"Real estate": Oxford English Dictionary online: Retrieved September 18, 2011</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realestate.asp|title=What Is Real Estate?|author=James Chen|date=May 2, 2019|website=investopedia.com|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>

Real estate is different from personal property, which is not permanently attached to the land, such as vehicles, boats, jewelry, furniture, tools and the rolling stock of a [[farm]].

==Residential real estate==
Residential real estate may contain either a single family or multifamily structure that is available for occupation or for non-business purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Title 16.

Residences can be classified by and how they are connected to neighbouring residences and land. Different types of housing tenure can be used for the same physical type. For example, connected residences might be owned by a single entity and leased out, or owned separately with an agreement covering the relationship between units and common areas and concerns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thebalance.com/real-estate-what-it-is-and-how-it-works-3305882|title=Real Estate, What It Is and How It Works|author=Kimberley Amadeo|date=March 28, 2019|website=thebalance.com|access-date=May 13, 2019}}</ref>

** [[Condominium]] (American English) – A building or complex, similar to apartments, owned by individuals. Common grounds and common areas within the complex are owned and shared jointly. In North America, there are ''townhouse'' or ''rowhouse'' style condominiums as well. The British equivalent is a block of flats.

The size of an apartment or house can be described in square feet or meters. In the United States, this includes the area of "living space", excluding the garage and other non-living spaces. The "square meters" figure of a house in Europe may report the total area of the walls enclosing the home, thus including any attached garage and non-living spaces, which makes it important to inquire what kind of surface area definition has been used. It can be described more roughly by the number of rooms. A [[studio apartment]] has a single bedroom with no living room (possibly a separate kitchen). A one-bedroom apartment has a living or dining room separate from the bedroom. Two bedroom, three bedroom, and larger units are common. (A bedroom is a separate room intended for sleeping.  It commonly contains a bed and, in newer dwelling units, a built-in closet for clothes storage.)

* [[Chawl]]s
* [[Villa]]s
* [[Haveli]]s

The size of these is measured in Gaz (square yards), Quila, Marla, Beegha, and acre.

==As an investment==
[[File:Bentleigh house.jpg|thumb|A house that was sold in Victoria Australia]]
In markets where land and building prices are rising, real estate is often purchased as an investment, whether or not the owner intends to use the property. Often investment properties are rented out, but "[[flipping]]" involves quickly reselling a property, sometimes taking advantage of [[arbitrage]] or quickly rising value, and sometimes after repairs are made that substantially raise the value of the property.

Luxury real estate is sometimes used as a way to store value, especially by wealthy foreigners, without any particular attempt to rent it out. Some luxury units in London and New York City have been used as a way for corrupt foreign government officials and businesspeople from countries without strong [[rule of law]] to [[launder money]] or to protect it from seizure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/01/american-housing-has-gone-insane/605005/ |title=Why Manhattan’s Skyscrapers Are Empty |date=16 Jan 2020 |magazine=The Atlantic}}</ref>
