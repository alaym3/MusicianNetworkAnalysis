'''The Go! Team''' are an English six-piece band from [[Brighton]], England. They combine [[indie rock]] and [[garage rock]] with a mixture of [[funk music|funk]] and [[Bollywood]] soundtracks, [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|double Dutch]] chants, old school [[hip hop]] and distorted guitars. Their songs are a mix of live instrumentation and [[sampling (music)|samples]] from various sources. The band's vocals vary between performances: while live vocals are handled mostly by [[Ninja (British rapper)|Ninja]], vocals on record also feature sampled and guest voices.

== History ==
Ian Parton conceived the project after wanting to create music incorporating [[Sonic Youth]]-style guitars, [[Double Dutch (jump rope)|double Dutch]] chants, Bollywood soundtracks, old school hip hop and electro.<ref>{{cite episode|title=4Play – The Go! Team|series=4Play|url=http://psychedelic-concentration-camp.com/gt05doc.htm|publisher=Psychedelic-concentration-camp.com|station=[[Channel 4]]|airdate=October 2005}}</ref> These ideas led towards the recording of ''[[Thunder, Lightning, Strike]]'' in his parents' kitchen.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2007/06/08/go_team_interview_feature.shtml|title=Ready, steady...GO!|first=Linda|last=Serck|publisher=BBC.co.uk|date=8 June 2007|access-date=30 April 2015}}</ref>

=== ''Thunder, Lightning, Strike'' ===
{{main|Thunder, Lightning, Strike}}
The Go! Team's first album, ''[[Thunder, Lightning, Strike]]'', was released in the UK and Europe on the [[Memphis Industries]] label in September 2004, to widespread critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/thunder-lightning-strike/the-go!-team/critic-reviews |title=Critic Reviews for Thunder, Lightning, Strike |publisher=Metacritic.com |access-date=30 April 2015}}</ref> The album was nominated for the [[Mercury Music Prize|Mercury Prize]] in 2005.

The album was recorded at Parton's parents' house and co-produced and mixed by Ian's brother Gareth Parton at The Fortress Studios, London.<ref>{{cite web|first=Tom |last=Doyle |url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/nov05/articles/goteam.htm |title=The Go! Team: Recording Thunder, Lightning, Strike |publisher=Soundonsound.com |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref>

In June 2004, Ian Parton recruited a band to play the Accelerator Festival in Sweden after having been asked to play when no band existed. The live band is a "separate entity" to the original studio vision, as the performances became radically different from the recordings, particularly due to vocalist Ninja's freestyled vocals over what had been instrumental studio tracks.

Ian Parton failed to clear any of the samples used in the album, believing it would not sell and nobody would notice. He and his brother later had to work with a musicologist to write around or recreate samples they could not use.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Go! Team: Recording Thunder, Lightning, Strike |url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/go-team-recording-thunder-lightning-strike |access-date=16 April 2021 |work=www.soundonsound.com}}</ref> The album was reissued with the reworked tracks in the United Kingdom and the United States the following year.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Go!

The band's popularity increased with the re-issue of "Ladyflash" in the UK, resulting in national primetime airplay on radio stations such as [[BBC Radio 1]], [[Xfm]] and the [[Atlanta]], US based [[WNNX (99X)|99X]].  The song "Get It Together" from ''Thunder, Lightning, Strike'' was featured in trailers for the video game ''[[LittleBigPlanet]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mediamolecule.com/2008/01/16/littlebigletters-the-letters/ |title=LittleBigLetters – the letters! – Media Molecule – We make games |publisher=Media Molecule |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref>
