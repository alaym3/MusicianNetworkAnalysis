'''Dinosaur Jr.''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Amherst, Massachusetts]], in 1984, originally simply called '''Dinosaur''' until legal issues forced a change in name.

The band was founded by [[J Mascis]] (guitar, vocals, primary songwriter), [[Lou Barlow]] (bass, vocals), and [[Murph (drummer)|Murph]] (drums). After three albums on [[independent record label|independent labels]], the band earned a reputation as one of the formative influences on American [[alternative rock]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dinosaur Jr. Rises from the Ashes — to Rock|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4812447|work=[[NPR]]|date=August 24, 2005|access-date=May 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Dinosaur Jr Still, And Always Will, Rule|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/why-dinosaur-jr-still-and-always-will-rule-47088|work=[[NME]]|date=June 22, 2009 |access-date=May 7, 2021}}</ref> Creative tension led to Mascis firing Barlow, who later formed [[Sebadoh]] and [[Folk Implosion]]. His replacement, [[Mike Johnson (bassist)|Mike Johnson]], came aboard for three major-label albums. Murph eventually quit, with Mascis taking over drum duties on the band's albums before the group disbanded in 1997. The original lineup reformed in 2005, releasing five albums thereafter.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://m.noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/rank-your-records-dinosaur-jr-j-mascis/|title=Rank Your Records: J Mascis Rates Dinosaur Jr. Albums from Bummer to Classic |website=M.noisey.vice.com|access-date=July 14, 2021}}</ref>

Mascis's drawling vocals and distinct guitar sound, hearkening back to 1960s and 1970s [[classic rock]] and characterized by extensive use of [[audio feedback|feedback]] and [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]], were highly influential in the alternative rock movement of the 1990s.<ref name="Azerrad 2001, p. 357">Azerrad (2001), p. 357.</ref>

==History==
===Formation===
Mascis and Barlow played together, on drums and guitar respectively, in the [[hardcore punk]] band [[Deep Wound]], formed in 1982 while the pair were attending high school in western [[Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.spin.com/2012/10/dinosaur-jr-rediscovering-the-gnarl/|title = Dinosaur Jr.: Rediscovering the Gnarl|date = October 4, 2012|website = Spin|last = Bevan|first = David}}</ref> After high school, they began exploring slower yet still aggressive music such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Replacements (band)|the Replacements]], and [[Neil Young]]. Mascis's college friend [[Gerard Cosloy]] introduced him to psychedelic-influenced pop bands like [[Dream Syndicate]], which Mascis in turn showed to Barlow. Barlow explained, "We loved [[speed metal]]&nbsp;... and we loved wimpy-[[jangle pop|jangly]] stuff".<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 350</ref>

Deep Wound broke up in mid-1984. Cosloy had dropped out of the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] to focus on running his independent record label, [[Homestead Records]], and promised Mascis that if he were to make a record Homestead would release it. Mascis wrote a number of songs by himself and showed them to Barlow, to whom he offered the bassist position. Barlow said the songs "were fucking brilliant&nbsp;...They were so far beyond. I was still into two-chord songs and basic stuff like 'I'm so sad.' While I was really into my own little tragedy, J was operating in this whole other panorama." Mascis enlisted vocalist Charlie Nakajima, also formerly of Deep Wound, and drummer Emmett Patrick Murphy, otherwise known as Murph, to complete the band. Mascis explained the concept behind the group as "ear-bleeding country".<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 351.</ref>

The band was initially named Mogo, and played their first show on University of Massachusetts Amherst campus in the first week of September 1984. However, Nakajima used the performance to launch an extended anti-police tirade. Mascis was so appalled by Nakajima's behavior at the show that he disbanded the group the next day. A few days later Mascis invited Barlow and Murph to form a new band without telling Nakajima. "I was kind of too wimpy to kick him out, exactly," Mascis later admitted. "Communicating with people has been a constant problem in the band." The trio named themselves Dinosaur, and Mascis and Barlow took over lead-vocal duties.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 352.</ref>

===''Dinosaur''===
Mascis took Cosloy up on his offer to release an album and Dinosaur recorded their debut album for $500 at a home studio in the woods outside [[Northampton, Massachusetts]].<ref name="Azerrad 353">Azerrad (2001), p. 353.</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Dinosaur (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Dinosaur]]'', was released in 1985. Mascis wrote all of the songs. Vocals were done by Mascis in his trademark nasal drawl which was often compared to singer Neil Young.<ref name="Azerrad 354"/> Mascis would sing most or all of the lead vocals on all of their subsequent releases. The album did not make much of an impact commercially or critically: it sold only about 1,500 copies in its first year and was largely ignored by the majority of the music press.<ref name="Azerrad 354">Azerrad (2001), p. 354.</ref>

After the record's release, Dinosaur would often drive to New York City to perform shows. At one of their shows, the New York-based alternative rock band [[Sonic Youth]] was at first unimpressed by the first Dinosaur performance they saw, but after watching them play several months later, approached the band declaring themselves as fans.<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 354–355.</ref> Sonic Youth invited Dinosaur to join them on tour in the American Northeast and northern Midwest in September 1986.

===''You're Living All Over Me''===
Dinosaur recorded much of their second album, ''[[You're Living All Over Me]]'', with Sonic Youth engineer [[Wharton Tiers]] in New York. During the recording process, tension emerged between Mascis and Murph because Mascis had very specific ideas for the drum parts. Barlow recalled, "J controlled Murph's every drumbeat&nbsp;... And Murph could not handle that. Murph wanted to kill J for the longest time."<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 356.</ref> Gerard Cosloy was excited by the completed album, but was devastated when Mascis told him the band was going to release it on California-based [[SST Records]]. Mascis was reluctant to sign a two-album deal with Homestead, but Cosloy felt betrayed, "There was ''no way'' I couldn't take it personally."<ref name="Azerrad 2001, p. 357"/> After the album's completion Mascis moved to New York, leaving the rest of the band feeling alienated.<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 358–359.</ref>

''You're Living All Over Me'' was released in 1987; early copies of the record in the Boston area were packaged with the ''Weed Forestin''' tape, the first release by Barlow's side project [[Sebadoh]]. The album received much more attention in the indie-rock community than the debut. Barlow also composed two songs:  the hardcore-influenced "Lose" and an acoustic sonic collage entitled "Poledo" that anticipated his work with [[Sebadoh]].

Immediately following the release of ''You're Living All Over Me'', a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] called [[the Dinosaurs]] (featuring ex-members of [[Country Joe and the Fish]], [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]], [[Hot Tuna]], [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Jefferson Airplane]]) sued Dinosaur over the use of the name, prompting the addition of "Jr."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Van Evra|first=Jennifer|date=May 23, 2007|title=When Dinosaur rocked the Earth|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/when-dinosaur-rocked-the-earth/article686130/|access-date=June 22, 2020|website=The Globe and Mail}}</ref>

===''Bug'' and Barlow's departure===
Dinosaur Jr. had a major breakthrough in the United Kingdom with their debut single for [[Blast First]], "[[Freak Scene]]", in 1988,<ref>Strong, Martin C. (2002), "The Great Rock Discography, 6th edn.", Canongate, {{ISBN|1-84195-312-1}}.</ref> a version with censored lyrics being issued for radio consumption. It reached number 4 in the UK independent chart, staying on the chart for 12 weeks.<ref name="Lazell">Lazell, Barry: "Indie Hits 1980-1989", 1997, Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}.</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Bug (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Bug]]'', followed shortly afterwards, reaching number 1 on the UK independent chart and spending 38 weeks in the chart.<ref name="Lazell" /> The band's first [[UK singles chart]] placing came in 1989 with their cover of [[The Cure]]'s "[[Just Like Heaven (The Cure song)|Just Like Heaven]]".

''Bug'' was similar in musical style to ''You're Living All Over Me'', with the contrast between the extremely distorted instruments and the melodic vocal parts intact, as was the band's unique blend of musical influences. However, this time out, there was even more melody and the song structures were more conventional. Mascis was exhibiting an even tighter control over the band's sound, singing lead vocals on all but one song and composing the parts for Murph and Lou to play. Barlow's only lead vocal was on the album's final track, featuring an overdriven, noise-rock backing track and Barlow screaming "Why don't you like me?"

Mascis has described ''Bug'' as his least favorite of the band's albums. In an interview in 2005, after the original line-up had reformed, he said, "''Bug'' is my least favourite of all our records. I like some of the songs but, I dunno, I guess I really don't like the vibe of it."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article/3592/Interviews/Dinosaur-Jr--Interview|title=Dinosaur Jr - Interview|website=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk|access-date=July 14, 2021}}</ref>

Despite the album's success, tension between Mascis and Barlow began interfering with the band's productivity, and in 1989, after touring in support of ''Bug'', Barlow was kicked out of the band. Barlow now focused all of his attention on the former side-project [[Sebadoh]]. "The Freed Pig", the opening track on 1991's ''[[Sebadoh III]]'', documents Barlow's frustration with Mascis and feeling of being treated poorly in Dinosaur Jr.

Meanwhile, the band embarked on an Australian tour with [[Donna Dresch]] filling in for Barlow. In 1990, the band released a new single, "[[The Wagon]]" on [[Sub Pop]], their first release since Barlow's departure. The single featured a short-lived lineup including guitarist [[Don Fleming (musician)|Don Fleming]] and drummer Jay Spiegel from the band [[Gumball (band)|Gumball]], in addition to Mascis and Murph.

===Major label years===
Despite the ongoing lineup turmoil, Dinosaur Jr. signed with Sire Records in 1990. They made their major-label debut ''[[Green Mind]]'' in 1991. The new record was virtually a J&nbsp;Mascis solo album, with Murph playing drums on only a few songs, as well as minimal contributions from Fleming and Spiegel, who were out of the band by the time the album was released. Mascis, whose first instrument was a drum kit, recorded many of the drum parts by himself, layering the various instrumental parts through overdubbing.

For touring purposes, Mascis first added [[Van Conner]], and then [[Mike Johnson (bassist)|Mike Johnson]] to handle the bass parts and embarked on several tours to support ''Green Mind'', with support acts that included [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].  In 1991, Sire records released an EP titled ''[[Whatever's Cool with Me]]'' that featured old B-sides coupled with one new track. In 1992, the band was part of the [[Rollercoaster Tour]], a package tour based on the successful [[Lollapolooza]] festival, which featured [[The Jesus and Mary Chain]], [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]] and [[Blur (band)|Blur]].

The band found their live shows well received in the changing musical climate of the early 1990s, and decided to record new material with the new lineup. This time, the recording sessions were with full participation from Murph and Johnson, with the former playing most of the drums and the latter playing all of the bass parts, singing harmony vocals and even contributing a few guitar solos.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} This material represented the peak of the band's commercial success, with the single "Start Choppin'" reaching the top 20 in the UK, and the album that followed, ''[[Where You Been]]'', reaching the UK top 10 and the US top 50. The opening track, "Out There", had an accompanying video and was aired on MTV for a short time, as the show ''[[120 Minutes]]'' was still popular as a late-night "alternative" video show. Although the new material was more accessible than the band's 1980s albums, in terms of playing it represented a partial return to the more unrestrained power-trio sound of the original lineup.

Murph left the band after touring for ''Where You Been'' and was replaced for the band's live shows by George Berz, leaving Mascis as the sole remaining original member. However, the band's subsequent albums would be recorded mostly by J&nbsp;Mascis on his own, playing everything except for the bass and some of the harmony vocals, which continued to be handled by Mike Johnson.  The commercial success continued with 1994's ''[[Without a Sound]]'', which placed well in both the US and UK album charts. After 1997's ''[[Hand It Over]]'', Mascis finally retired the Dinosaur Jr. name, with the group's final live performance being an appearance on the American talk show ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Watch Five Essential Dinosaur Jr. Clips |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |date=September 20, 2002 |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/47822-watch-five-essential-dinosaur-jr-clips/ |access-date=September 22, 2010 |first=Evan |last=Minsker}}</ref> In 1999, Mascis released the first of two solo albums under the name [[J Mascis + The Fog]].

===2005 reunion and onward===
The beginnings of a Mascis–Barlow détente started in the mid-'90s when Mascis began showing up at [[Sebadoh]] shows. "I think he was kind of aware of how much shit I was talking about him," Barlow noted in a 2005 interview, "but I don't think he really ever pursued any of it. One of the things that really triggered this, for me to finally just go, 'Hey, you know, maybe this could work,' is when I realized that maybe J wasn't really holding any kind of grudge against me because he didn't like me. I was thinking, maybe he just didn't realize what he had done, or maybe he wasn't really aware of how much he'd actually hurt me. And when I started to realize that, he kind of became more human to me."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.avclub.com/article/dinosaur-jr-13943|title=Onion AV Club Interview|access-date=February 16, 2017|publisher=The Onion|author=Hawthorne, Marc}}</ref>

In 2002, the two shared the stage for two shows in London, with Barlow singing ''I Wanna Be Your Dog'' along with Mascis, [[Ron Asheton]], [[Scott Asheton]] and [[Mike Watt]], who had been performing [[The Stooges|Stooges]] songs as "Asheton, Asheton, Mascis and Watt".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,860030,00.html|title=Hell For Leather|access-date=April 15, 2008|newspaper=The Observer|author=Empire, Kitty | location=London|date=December 15, 2002|author-link=Kitty Empire}}</ref>

Mascis regained the master rights to the band's first three albums from SST in 2004, and arranged for their reissue on [[Merge Records|Merge]] early 2005. Later that year, he and Barlow shared the stage at benefit show for [[autism]] at [[Smith College]] organized by Barlow's mother in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], and played together as [[Deep Wound]] after Mascis and Sebadoh had completed their respective sets.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/news/globe/living/articles/2005/07/15/dinosaur_jr_is_happy_to_be_no_longer_extinct|title=Dinosaur Jr. is happy to be no longer extinct|access-date=April 14, 2008|work=The Boston Globe|author=Anderman, Joan| date=July 15, 2005}}</ref>
[[File:Dinosaur Jr @ The Ritz, Manchester 1-2-2013 (8440212597).jpg|thumb|Dinosaur Jr. on stage at the Manchester Ritz during the ''[[I Bet on Sky]]'' tour, February 1, 2013]]
Following the reissues in 2005, Mascis, Barlow and Murph finally reunited to play on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'' on April 15, 2005, and in June that year, they kicked off a tour of Europe. While performing in New York City in 2006, much of the band's equipment was stolen while stored outside their hotel and has not yet been recovered.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nme.com/news/dinosaur-jr/24158|title=Dinosaur Jr's gear stolen mid-tour|access-date=April 14, 2008|magazine=NME}}</ref> The band members were later among the curators of 2006's [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival.

In 2007, the original members of Dinosaur Jr. released ''[[Beyond (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Beyond]]'' on [[Fat Possum Records]], their first album of new material as a trio since ''Bug'' in 1988.  It was met with critical acclaim, rating an 8.4 from [[Pitchfork Media]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/10127-beyond/ |title=Dinosaur Jr. - Beyond |access-date=April 14, 2008|publisher=Pitchfork Media|author=Baron, Zach}}</ref> and garnering positive reviews from the music press as a whole. It was considered somewhat of a sonic paradox in that even though it featured the original members who produced "two records so drenched in noise they still sound like aural assaults decades after their original release," sonically it resembled the major label releases of the 1990s in both production values and stylistic range.<ref>{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=beyond-mw0000568152|pure_url=yes}}|title=Dinosaur Jr. - Beyond|access-date=April 14, 2008|website=[[AllMusic]]|author=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas}}</ref> On the other hand, while the sound was not as extreme as the original lineup's 1980s albums, it did feature a much bigger, more unrestrained, and more live-sounding feel than their 1990s albums, though Barlow's bass was noticeably quieter than in the old days.  Barlow did make his mark on the music in other ways:  for the first time since ''You're Living All Over Me'', he contributed to the songwriting.  The album went on to good commercial success, debuting on the ''Billboard'' 200 at number 69 its opening week.

In February 2009, the band signed with indie label [[Jagjaguwar]].<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Thiessen |first=Brock |url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid2=844&fid1=36786&csid1=0 |title=Dinosaur Jr. Sign to Jagjaguwar |magazine=[[Exclaim!]] |date=February 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709164759/http://exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid2=844&fid1=36786&csid1=0 |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |access-date=January 10, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The band's first release on the new label was titled ''[[Farm (album)|Farm]]'' and released on June 23, 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/34896-new-dinosaur-jr-lp-details/ |title=New Dinosaur Jr. LP Details Announced |access-date=March 24, 2009 |publisher=Pitchfork Media|author=Dombal, Ryan|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103003919/http://pitchfork.com/news/34896-new-dinosaur-jr-lp-details/ |archive-date=November 3, 2010}}</ref> Murph said the album was recorded at Mascis's home and marks return to the heavier, ''Where You Been'' LP era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npaper-wehaa.com/citypulse/cqG9Wrj2laG55t1O/?article=275838|title=Digging Up Dinosaur Jr.|access-date=October 1, 2009|publisher=CityPulse|author=Tupica, Rich}}</ref> The album reached number 29 on the ''Billboard'' 200, making it the band's highest-charting album in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dinosaur-jr/chart-history/TLP|title=Dinosaur Jr. - Chart history (Billboard 200)|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=May 4, 2021}}</ref> To promote the album, the band played ''<nowiki>Farm'</nowiki>''s lead-off track, "Pieces", on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' on June 25, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/band-bench/|title=Late Night Band Bench|access-date=June 18, 2009|publisher=NBC}}</ref>

In February 2019, the song "Over Your Shoulder" from the band's 1994 album ''Without a Sound'' reached number 18 on Japan's ''Billboard'' charts.

|description=Sample of "[[Freak Scene]]" from the band's third album ''[[Bug (Dinosaur Jr. album)|Bug]]'' (1988), a song that features Mascis's distinctive "slacker" vocal drawl and a layered guitar sound.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Dinosaur Jr. is considered to be an alternative rock band; however the band's musical style, compared to its underground contemporaries in the 1980s, differed in several ways. This included the influence of classic rock on the band's music, their use of feedback, extreme volume and the loud-quiet dynamic, and frontman Mascis's droning vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://npaper-wehaa.com/citypulse#c-275838 |title=CityPulse by Wehaa |publisher=Npaper-wehaa.com |access-date=July 1, 2011}}</ref> A characteristic of Mascis's vocal style is frequent use of [[vocal fry]]. Gerald Cosloy, head of Homestead Records, summarised the band's music: "It was its own bizarre hybrid. ... It wasn't exactly pop, it wasn't exactly punk rock—it was completely its own thing".<ref name="Azerrad 353" />

Mascis listened to [[classic rock]] artists such as [[the Rolling Stones]] and [[the Beach Boys]], elements of which were incorporated into Dinosaur Jr.'s sound.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 348.</ref> In addition, Mascis was also a fan of many punk and hardcore bands such as [[The Birthday Party (band)|The Birthday Party]], and has frequently noted [[Nick Cave]] as an influence. Dinosaur Jr.'s members also combined elements of [[hardcore punk]] and [[noise rock]] in their songs, which often featured a large amount of feedback, distortion and extreme volume.<ref name="auto"/> When the master tape of ''[[You're Living All Over Me]]'' arrived at SST, the label's production manager noticed the level on the tape was so high it was distorting; however, Mascis confirmed it was the way he wanted the album to sound.<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 361.</ref>

Similar to Mascis's guitar work, Barlow's bass lines, with their alternating heavily distorted, fast chords and pulverizing lows, draw heavily from both his hardcore past and musicians such as [[Lemmy]] from [[Motörhead]] and [[Johnny Ramone]]. "Johnny Ramone is my hero. I wanted to make that rhythmic chugging sound like he got playing guitar with the Ramones. And, I found that I got a bigger sound by strumming farther up the neck."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bassplayer.com/article/lou-barlow-jurassic/jul-05/11352|title=Lou Barlow Jurassic Rock|access-date=April 15, 2008|publisher=Bassplayer.com|author=Olwell, Greg|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303210832/http://www.bassplayer.com/article/lou-barlow-jurassic/jul-05/11352|archive-date=March 3, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/music/features/feature_1118721694 |title=Bulbs, Bugs and Little Fury Things: Revisiting Dinosaur Jr |access-date=April 15, 2008 |publisher=Staticmultimedia.com |author=Bergrand, Adrian |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820115451/http://www.staticmultimedia.com/content/music/features/feature_1118721694 |archive-date=August 20, 2008}}</ref>

Mascis's vocals are another distinctive feature of Dinosaur Jr.'s music. He attributed his "whiny low-key drawl", the opposite of the hardcore punk "bark",<ref name="Azerrad 353" /> to artists such as [[John Fogerty]] and [[Mick Jagger]].<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 353–354.</ref> His style also resembled Neil Young's, but Mascis disputed this, and later commented: "That got annoying, being compared all the time."<ref name="Azerrad 354" /> His drawl epitomised the band's slacker ethos and relaxed attitude; author [[Michael Azerrad]] said "even Mascis seemed removed from the feelings he was conveying in the music".<ref>Azerrad (2001), p. 346.</ref>

==Legacy==
In a [[BBC]] review of their reissued albums ''You're Living All Over Me'' and ''Bug'', Zoe Street called them "Frighteningly ahead of their time."<ref>{{cite web|last=Street|first=Zoe|title= Dinosaur Jr. Dinosaur, You're Living All Over Me, Bug Review |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/98bd/|work=[[BBC]]|access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref> ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' called them "one of [[post-punk]]’s most influential bands."<ref>{{cite web|last=Talbott|first=Chris|title=Influential Dinosaur Jr. reunites, releases first album in 20 years |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/influential-dinosaur-jr-reunites-releases-first-album-in-20-years/|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=June 13, 2007|access-date=May 23, 2021}}</ref> According to Azerrad:<ref>Azerrad (2001), pp. 345.</ref><blockquote>Dinosaur Jr was one of the first, biggest, and best bands among the second generation of indie kids, the ones who took [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] and [[Minor Threat]] for granted, a generation for whom the Seventies, not the Sixties, was the nostalgic ideal. Their music continued a retrograde stylistic shift in the American underground that the Replacements and other bands had begun: renouncing the antihistorical tendencies of hardcore and fully embracing the music that everyone had grown up on. In particular, Dinosaur singer-guitarist J Mascis achieved the unthinkable in [[underground rock]]—he brought back the extended [[guitar solo]].</blockquote>Dinosaur Jr's music has influenced many other musicians such as [[Kurt Cobain]] of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]],<ref name="Attfield 2011, p. 30">Attfield (2011), p. 30</ref> [[Billy Corgan]] of [[The Smashing Pumpkins]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Brett|date=2018-08-11|title=Billy Corgan Reveals Greatest 90's Grunge Band|url=https://www.alternativenation.net/billy-corgan-reveals-greatest-90s-grunge-band/|access-date=2021-11-25|website=AlternativeNation.net|language=en-US}}</ref> [[Black Francis]] of [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=Frank Black: "When I get asked about Nirvana, I think, 'Am I being validated because some other dude mentioned my name?'
