'''Ray Edward Cochran''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|k|r|ən}}; October 3, 1938 – April 17, 1960) was an American [[rock and roll]] musician. Cochran's songs, such as "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]", "[[Summertime Blues]]", "[[C'mon Everybody]]", and "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]", captured teenage frustration and desire in the mid-1950s and early 1960s.<ref name=RRHOF>{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Michael|title=Eddie Cochran: Hall of Fame Essay|work=Inductees of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]|location=Cleveland, Ohio|year=1987|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/eddie-cochran/|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> He experimented with [[multitrack recording]], distortion techniques, and [[overdubbing]] even on his earliest singles.<ref name=Cochran2003>{{cite book|last1=Cochran|first1=Bobby|author-link=Bobby Cochran|last2=Van Hecke|first2=Susan|title=Three Steps to Heaven: The Eddie Cochran Story|publisher=Hal Leonard|location=Milwaukee, Wisconsin|year=2003|isbn=978-0634032523}}</ref> He played the guitar, piano, bass, and drums.<ref name=RRHOF/> His image as a sharply dressed and attractive young man with a rebellious attitude epitomized the stance of the 1950s rocker, and in death he achieved iconic status.<ref name=allmusic>{{cite web|last=Deming|first=Mark|author-link=Mark Deming|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=www.allmusic.com|year=2020|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/eddie-cochran-mn0000793988/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref>

Cochran was involved with music from an early age, playing in the school band and teaching himself to play blues guitar.<ref name=Cochran2003/> In 1954, he formed a duet with the guitarist [[Hank Cochran]] (no relation). When they split the following year, Eddie began a songwriting career with [[Jerry Capehart]]. His first success came when he performed the song "Twenty Flight Rock" in the film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]'', starring [[Jayne Mansfield]]. Soon afterward, he signed a recording contract with [[Liberty Records]] and his first record for the label, "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", rose to number 18 on the [[Billboard charts]].

Cochran died at age 21 in St Martin's Hospital, [[Bath, Somerset]], after a road accident in [[Chippenham]], Wiltshire, at the end of his British tour in April 1960. He had just performed at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]]. Though his best-known songs were released during his lifetime, more of his songs were released posthumously. In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. His songs have been recorded by a wide variety of recording artists.

==Early life==
Cochran was born October 3, 1938, in [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]], to Alice and Frank R. Cochran.<ref name=Cochran2003/> His parents were from Oklahoma, and he always said in interviews that his parents had some roots in Oklahoma. He took music lessons in school but quit the band to play drums. Also, rather than taking piano lessons, he began learning guitar, playing country and other music he heard on the radio.

==Career==
Cochran's family moved to [[Bell Gardens, California]], in 1952. As his guitar playing improved, he formed a band with two friends from his junior high school. He dropped out of [[Bell Gardens High School]] in his first year to become a professional musician.<ref name=Gretsch>{{cite web|title=Eddie Cochran Biography|work=Featured Pages|publisher=Gretsch Guitars|location=Savannah, Georgia|year=2020|url=https://www.gretschguitars.com/features/eddie-cochran|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> During a show featuring many performers at an [[American Legion]] hall, he met [[Hank Cochran]], a songwriter. Although they were not related, they recorded as the Cochran Brothers and began performing together.<ref name=RBHOF>{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Alan|title=Eddie Cochran|work=Rockabilly Legends|publisher=[[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]|location=Nashville, Tennessee|year=2020|url=http://www.rockabillyhall.com/EddieCochran.html|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> They recorded a few singles for [[Ekko Records]] that were fairly successful and helped to establish them as a performing act. Eddie Cochran also worked as a session musician and began writing songs, making a demo with [[Jerry Capehart]], his future [[music manager|manager]].

In July 1956, Eddie Cochran's first "solo artist" single was released by [[Crest Records]].<ref name=bigvjamboree>{{cite web|last=Vidal|first=Paul|title=The Crest Records Story|work=The Labels
|publisher=Paul Vidal Enterprises, Inc.|year=2020|url=http://www.bigvjamboree.com/CREST-RECORDS.html|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> It featured "Skinny Jim", now regarded as a rock-and-roll and rockabilly classic. In the spring of 1956, Boris Petroff asked Cochran if he would appear in the musical comedy film ''[[The Girl Can't Help It]]''. Cochran agreed and performed the song "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" in the movie. In 1957 Cochran starred in his second film, ''[[Untamed Youth]]'', and he had yet another hit, "[[Sittin' in the Balcony]]", one of the few songs he recorded that was written by other songwriters (in this case [[John D. Loudermilk]]). "Twenty Flight Rock" was written by AMI staff writer [[Ned Fairchild]] (a pen name—her real name is Nelda Fairchild). Fairchild, who was not a rock and roll performer, merely provided the initial form of the song; the co-writing credit reflects Cochran's major changes and contributions to the final product.

In the Summer of 1957 [[Liberty Records]] issued Cochran's only studio album released during his lifetime, ''[[Singin' to My Baby]]''. The album included "Sittin' in the Balcony". There were only a few rockers on this album, and Liberty seemed to want to move Cochran away from Rock and Roll.

In 1958, Cochran seemed to find his stride in the famous teenage anthem "[[Summertime Blues]]" (co-written with [[Jerry Capehart]]). With this song, Cochran was established as one of the most important influences on rock and roll in the 1950s, both lyrically and musically. The song, released by [[Liberty Records|Liberty]] recording no. 55144, charted at number&nbsp;8 in 1958. Cochran's brief career included a few more hits, such as "[[C'mon, Everybody]]", "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]", "[[Teenage Heaven]]", and his posthumous UK number one hit "[[Three Steps to Heaven (song)|Three Steps to Heaven]]". He remained popular in the US and UK through the late 1950s and early 1960s, and more of his records were posthumous hits, such as "My Way", "[[Weekend (Eddie Cochran song)|Weekend]]", and "Nervous Breakdown".

Another aspect of Cochran's short but brilliant career is his work as backup musician and producer.<ref name=bigvjamboree/> In 1959 he played lead for [[Skeets McDonald]] at Columbia's studios for "You Oughta See Grandma Rock" and "Heart Breaking Mama". In a session for [[Gene Vincent]] in March 1958 he contributed his trademark bass voice, as heard on "[[Summertime Blues]]". The recordings were issued on the album ''A Gene Vincent Record Date''.<ref name=eddiecochran>[http://www.eddiecochran.info/Sessions/IV.htm ''Eddie Cochran's Sessions''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810005803/http://www.eddiecochran.info/Sessions/IV.htm|date=August 10, 2016 }}, eddiecochran.info; retrieved May 26, 2013.</ref>

In early 1959, two of Cochran's friends, [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], along with the [[Big Bopper]], were [[The Day the Music Died|killed in a plane crash]] while on tour. Cochran's friends and family later said that he was badly shaken by their deaths, and he developed a morbid premonition that he also would die young. Shortly after their deaths, he recorded a song (written by disc jockey Tommy Dee) in tribute to them, "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]". He was anxious to give up life on the road and spend his time in the studio making music, thereby reducing the chance of suffering a similar fatal accident while touring. Financial responsibilities, however, required that he continue to perform live, and that led to his acceptance of an offer to tour the United Kingdom in 1960.

==Death==
[[File:Eddie Cochran Memorial, Rowden Hil, Chippenham - May 2021.jpg|thumb|Eddie Cochran Memorial, Rowden Hill, Chippenham]]
Cochran was on tour in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] from January through April 1960.<ref name=americanrocknrolluktours>{{Cite web | url=http://www.americanrocknrolluktours.co.uk/tour/eddie-cochran-jan-april-1960/ |title = Eddie Cochran – Jan / April 1960 « American Rock n Roll the UK Tours}}</ref> He and his friend and fellow performing artist [[Gene Vincent]] had just finished performing at the last of their scheduled concerts at the [[Bristol Hippodrome]] on April 16, a Saturday night. They were traveling along the [[A4 road (England)#Chippenham to Bath (12.7 miles)|Bath Road]] in a taxi (a cream-coloured 1960 model [[Ford Consul#Ford Consul Mark II (1956–1962)|Ford Consul Mark II]] saloon) from [[Bristol]] towards London. In addition to Cochran and Vincent, the other passengers in the vehicle were [[Sharon Sheeley]] (a 20-year-old songwriter who was also Cochran's fiancée at the time), Patrick Tompkins (the tour manager, 29 years old), and George Martin (the 19-year-old taxi driver). At about 11:50&nbsp;p.m. that night, Martin lost control of the vehicle, which subsequently crashed into a concrete lamppost at Rowden Hill in [[Chippenham]].<ref name=Simmonds2008>{{cite book|last=Simmonds|first=Jeremy|title=The Encyclopedia of Dead Rock Stars: Heroin, Handguns, and Ham Sandwiches|chapter=Introduction|page=xii|publisher=Chicago Review Press|location=Chicago|year=2008|isbn=978-1-55652-754-8}}</ref> At the moment of impact, Cochran (who was seated in the center of the back seat) threw himself over Sheeley to shield her. The force of the collision caused the left rear passenger door to open,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eddie-cochran.info/the_crash.htm |title = The Crash}}</ref> and Cochran was ejected from the vehicle, sustaining a massive [[traumatic brain injury]] from blunt force trauma to the skull. The pavement was dry and the weather was good, but the vehicle was later determined to be traveling at an excessive speed.<ref name=Stanton2003>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Scott|edition=2|title=The Tombstone Tourist: Musicians|chapter=Eddie Cochran|pages=50–53|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=2003|isbn=978-0743463300}}</ref> No other vehicle was involved in the incident.<ref name=Stanton2003/>

The occupants of the vehicle were all taken to Chippenham Community Hospital and later transferred to St Martin's Hospital in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]]. Cochran never regained consciousness, and died at 4:10&nbsp;p.m. the following day – Easter Sunday.<ref name=DeathCert>{{cite web|url=http://www.eddie-cochran.info/IMAGES/The%20Crash_files/CR_17.JPG|title=Certified Copy of an Entry of Death: Edward Ray Cochran|publisher=County Borough of Bath|date=July 2, 1960|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> Sheeley suffered injuries to her back and thigh, Vincent suffered a fractured collarbone and severe injuries to his legs, and Tompkins sustained facial injuries and a possible fracture of the base of the skull. Martin did not sustain significant injuries.

Vincent and Sheeley returned to the United States after the accident. Cochran's body was flown home, and after a funeral service was buried on April 25, at [[Forest Lawn Memorial-Parks & Mortuaries|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Cypress, California]].<ref name=Cochran2003/> Martin was convicted of dangerous driving, fined £50 (and in default of payment six months imprisonment), and disqualified from driving for 15 years.<ref name=Collis2011>{{Cite book|title=Gene Vincent & Eddie Cochran|last=Collis|first=John|date=August 19, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-7535-4783-0|language=en}}</ref> His driving disqualification was lifted on May 7, 1968, after the judge at [[Bristol Crown Court|Bristol Assizes]] determined that Martin "had suffered considerable financial hardship".<ref name=DailyMirror1968>{{cite news|url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/BL/0000560/19680508/009/0002?browse=False|title=15-year ban on driver lifted|access-date=February 26, 2020|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|page=2|date=May 8, 1968}}{{subscription required}}</ref> The car and other items from the crash were impounded at the local police station until a coroner's inquest could be held. David Harman, a police cadet at the station, who would later become known as [[Dave Dee]] of the band [[Dave Dee, Dozy, Beaky, Mick & Tich]], is said to have played on Cochran's [[Gretsch 6120]] guitar while it was held at the station.<ref name=Kimmet2001>{{cite web|title=Seance with a Gretsch G 6120|url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/9-10-01/music-eddie-cochran.HTML|author=Kimmet, Ian|date=October 9, 2001}}</ref>

==Posthumous releases and honors==
A posthumous album, ''[[My Way (Eddie Cochran album)|My Way]]'', was released in 1964. Cochran was a prolific performer, and the British label Rockstar Records has released more of his music posthumously than was released during his life. The company is still looking for unpublished songs. One of his posthumous releases was "[[Three Stars (song)|Three Stars]]", a tribute to J. P. Richardson, better known as [[the Big Bopper]], and Cochran's friends [[Buddy Holly]] and [[Ritchie Valens]], who had all [[Day the Music Died|died in a plane crash]] just one year earlier. Written just hours after the tragedy by disc jockey Tommy Dee, it was recorded by Cochran two days later (Dee recorded his own version several weeks later). His voice broke during the spoken lyrics about Valens and Holly.

In 1987, Cochran was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=RRHOF/> His pioneering contribution to the genre of rockabilly has also been recognized by the [[Rockabilly Hall of Fame]]. Several of his songs have been re-released since his death, such as "C'mon Everybody", which was a number 14 hit in 1988 in the UK. ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked him number 84 on its 2003 list of the 100 greatest guitarists of all time. Cochran's life is chronicled in several publications, including ''Don't Forget Me: The Eddie Cochran Story'', by [[Julie Mundy]] and [[Darrel Higham]] ({{ISBN|0-8230-7931-7}}), and ''Three Steps to Heaven'', by Bobby Cochran ({{ISBN|0-634-03252-6}}). ''The Very Best of Eddie Cochran'' was released by EMI Records on June 2, 2008. On September 27, 2010, the mayor of [[Bell Gardens, California]], declared October 3, 2010, to be "Eddie Cochran Day" to celebrate the famous musician who began his career when living in that city.

In 1963 the pop star [[Heinz Burt]] paid tribute to Cochran with the song "[[Just Like Eddie]]". Produced by [[Joe Meek]], the song was a top 5 chart hit.

==Style and influence==
Cochran was one of the first rock-and-roll artists to write his own songs and overdub tracks. He is also credited with being one of the first to use an unwound third string to "bend" notes up a whole tone—an innovation (imparted to UK guitarist Joe Brown, who secured much session work as a result) that has since become an essential part of the standard rock guitar vocabulary. Artists such as [[Joan Jett|Joan Jett and the Blackhearts]], the [[the Rolling Stones|Rolling Stones]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[UFO (band)]], [[Van Halen]], [[Tom Petty]], [[Rod Stewart]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[Cliff Richard]], the [[the Who|Who]], [[Stray Cats]], the [[the Beach Boys|Beach Boys]], the [[the Beatles|Beatles]], [[Blue Cheer]], [[Led Zeppelin]], the [[the White Stripes|White Stripes]], the [[the Sex Pistols|Sex Pistols]], [[Sid Vicious]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Simple Minds]], [[George Thorogood]], [[Guitar Wolf]], [[Paul McCartney]], [[Alan Jackson]], [[Terry Manning]], the [[the Move|Move]], [[David Bowie]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Johnny Hallyday]] and [[U2]]<ref name=Axver>{{Cite web|url=http://www.u2gigs.com/Cmon_Everybody-s191.html|title=U2 C'mon Everybody – U2 on tour|last=Axver|first=Matthias Muehlbradt, Andre|website=U2gigs.com|access-date=February 26, 2016}}</ref> have covered his songs.

It was because Paul McCartney knew the chords and words to "[[Twenty Flight Rock]]" that he became a member of the Beatles. John Lennon was so impressed that he invited McCartney to play with his band, the [[the Quarrymen|Quarrymen]]. [[Jimi Hendrix]] performed "Summertime Blues" early in his career, and [[Pete Townshend]] of the [[the Who|Who]] was heavily influenced by Cochran's guitar style ("Summertime Blues" was a staple of live performances by the Who for most of their career, until the death of bassist and vocalist [[John Entwistle]] in 2002, and is featured on their album ''[[Live at Leeds]]''). [[San Francisco Sound]] band [[Blue Cheer]]'s version of "Summertime Blues" was their only hit and signature song, and has been described as the first [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] song.<ref name=Warren>{{cite book|editor1-last=George-Warren|editor1-first=Holly|editor2-last=Romanowski|editor2-first=PAtricia|title=The Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bluecheer/biography|access-date=April 14, 2020|year=2001|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0743292016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202120229/https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/bluecheer/biography|archive-date=December 2, 2008}}</ref> [[Terry Manning]] recorded a live version of "[[Somethin' Else (song)|Somethin' Else]]" at a concert inside [[Elvis Presley]]'s first house in [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]].

The [[glam rock]] artist [[Marc Bolan]] had his main [[Gibson Les Paul]] guitar refinished in a transparent orange to resemble the [[Gretsch]] 6120 played by Cochran, who was his music hero.<ref name=Bacon2002>{{cite book|last=Bacon|first=Tony|title=50 Years of the Gibson Les Paul|year=2002|publisher=Backbeat Books|isbn=0-87930-711-0|page=71}}</ref> He was also an influence on the guitar player [[Brian Setzer]], of [[Stray Cats]], who plays a 6120 almost like that of Cochran, whom he portrayed in the film ''[[La Bamba (film)|La Bamba]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093378/fullcredits/?ref_=tt_ov_st_sm|title=La Bamba (movie)|access-date=May 11, 2020}}</ref>
