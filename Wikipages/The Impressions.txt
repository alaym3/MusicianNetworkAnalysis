'''The Impressions''' were an [[United States|American]] [[music]] group originally formed in 1958. Their repertoire includes [[doo-wop]], [[gospel music|gospel]], [[soul music|soul]], and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/life/entertainment/story/2012/dec/02/rb-trio-with-two-chattanooga-members-still/94000/ |title=R&B trio, with two Chattanooga members, still in the public eye after 50 years |newspaper=Times Free Press |date=2012-12-02 |access-date=2015-11-26}}</ref>

The group was founded as the ''Roosters'' by [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] natives [[Sam Gooden]], Richard Brooks and Arthur Brooks, who moved to [[Chicago]] and added [[Jerry Butler]] and [[Curtis Mayfield]] to their line-up to become ''Jerry Butler & the Impressions''. By 1962 Butler and the Brookses had departed, and after switching to [[ABC-Paramount Records]], Mayfield, Gooden, and returning original Impression [[Fred Cash]] collectively became a top-selling soul act. Mayfield left the group for a solo career in 1970; [[Leroy Hutson]], Ralph Johnson, Reggie Torian (born Reginald Torian), 
and Nate Evans ([[Twinight Records]]) were among the replacements who joined Gooden and Cash. Inductees into both the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]], the Impressions had a string of hits in the 1960s, many of which were heavily influenced by [[gospel music]] and served as inspirational anthems for the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. They are also 1998 [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] inductees for their hit "[[People Get Ready]]" and winners of the [[Rhythm and Blues Foundation|Rhythm and Blues Foundation's]] Pioneer Award (in 2000). The group's long career spanned over 60 years at the time of their retirement in 2018.

==History==
===Early years===
Jerry Butler and Curtis Mayfield met while singing in the same [[Chicago]] [[Christian church|church]] [[choir]].  After singing in a number of local gospel groups, the two of them joined a [[doo-wop]] group called the "Roosters" in 1957, whose members included [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] natives [[Sam Gooden]], [[Richard Brooks (singer)|Richard Brooks]], and his brother Arthur Brooks.  By 1958, the Roosters had a new manager in Eddie Thomas, a record deal with Vee-Jay Records, and a new name: "Jerry Butler & the Impressions".

The group's first hit single was 1958's "[[For Your Precious Love]]", which hit No. 11 on the US pop charts and No. 3 on the R&B charts.  However, soon after the release of the R&B Top 30 hit "Come Back My Love", Butler left the group to go on to a successful solo career.  After briefly touring as the [[guitarist]] with the now-solo Butler, Curtis Mayfield became the group's new lead singer and [[songwriter]], and [[Fred Cash]], a returning original Roosters member, was appointed as the new fifth member.

===ABC-Paramount Records success===
Mayfield wrote a number of Butler's early solo hits, and used the money to get the Impressions to move to Chicago, Illinois. There, they got a new deal with [[ABC-Paramount Records]] in 1961, and released their first post-Butler single. That single, "[[Gypsy Woman (The Impressions song)|Gypsy Woman]]", was their biggest single to date, hitting No. 2 on the R&B charts and No. 20 on the pop chart. Successive singles failed to match "Gypsy Woman"′s success, and Richard and Arthur Brooks ended up leaving the group in 1962.

The Impressions returned to Chicago as a trio, and soon aligned themselves with [[record producer|producer]] [[Johnny Pate]], who helped to update their sound and create a more lush [[soul music|soul]] sound for the group. The result was "[[It's All Right]]", a 1963 million-selling [[RIAA certification|gold]] single that topped the R&B charts and made it to No. 4 on the pop charts, and became one of the group's signature songs. "It's All Right" and "Gypsy Woman" were the anchors of the Impressions' first LP, 1963's ''The Impressions''.

1964 brought the first of Mayfield's [[African-American|Black]] pride anthem compositions, "[[Keep on Pushing (song)|Keep on Pushing]]", which became a Top 10 smash on both the ''Billboard'' Pop and R&B charts, peaking at No. 10 Pop. It was the title cut from the [[Keep On Pushing|album of the same name]], which also reached the Top 10 on both charts. Future Mayfield compositions featured an increasingly social and political awareness, including the following year's major hit and the group's best-known song, the gospel-influenced "People Get Ready", which hit No. 3 on the R&B chart and No. 14 on the pop chart.

===Increasing social consciousness===
In the mid-1960s, the Impressions were compared with [[Motown]] acts such as [[the Temptations]], [[the Miracles]], and [[the Four Tops]]. Their 1966 single "Can't Satisfy" was deemed to share significant similarities with [[This Old Heart of Mine (Is Weak for You)|"This Old Heart Of Mine (Is Weak For You)"]] by Motown group [[the Isley Brothers]]; Motown sued and Curtis Mayfield had to share writing credits with songwriting-production team [[Holland-Dozier-Holland]] and [[Sylvia Moy]] for his song. "Can't Satisfy" was nevertheless a Top 20 R&B hit for the Impressions, peaking at No. 12, and has since become a [[Northern Soul]] classic. After 1965's "Woman's Got Soul", and the No. 7 pop hit "Amen", the Impressions failed to reach the R&B Top Ten for three more years, finally scoring in 1968 with the #9 "I Loved and Lost". "[[We're a Winner]]", which hit No. 1 on the R&B charts that same year, represented a new level of social awareness in Mayfield's music. Mayfield created his own label, Curtom, and moved the Impressions to the label.  Over the next two years, more Impressions message tracks followed, including the No. 1 R&B hit "[[Choice of Colors]]" (1969) and the No. 3 R&B hit "Check Out Your Mind" (1970).

The Impressions were a notable influence on [[Bob Marley and the Wailers]] and other [[ska]]/[[rocksteady]] groups and singers in [[Jamaica]]: the Wailers modelled their singing/harmony style on them and in part borrowed their look, too. There are many covers of Impressions songs by the Wailers, including "Keep On Moving", "Long Long Winter" and "Just Another Dance". [[Bob Marley]] also sampled the lyrics of the Impressions song "People, Get Ready" for his song "[[One Love/People Get Ready]]". The Wailers had recorded it on several occasions before it was released as a single in 1984. Original recordings of the song do not credit Mayfield's song and are simply titled "One Love" (as copyright law was not enforced for Jamaican recordings at the time) but the version for their album 1977 [[Exodus (Bob Marley & the Wailers album)|''Exodus'']] (and 1984 single) is titled "One Love/People Get Ready" and credits Mayfield, giving co-authorship credits to both Marley and Mayfield. In addition, [[Pat Kelly (musician)|Pat Kelly]] covered "Soulful Love" and The Heptones covered "I've Been Trying" and “Choice of Color”.

===After Mayfield's departure===
After the release of the ''Check Out Your Mind'' LP in 1970, Mayfield left the group and began a successful solo career, the highlight of which was writing and producing the ''[[Super Fly (soundtrack)|Super Fly]]'' soundtrack, followed by collaborating on the soundtracks of ''[[Claudine (soundtrack)|Claudine]]'', ''[[Sparkle (Aretha Franklin album)|Sparkle]]'', and ''[[A Piece of the Action (soundtrack)|A Piece of the Action]]''.  He continued to write and produce for the Impressions, who remained on Curtom.  [[Leroy Hutson]] was the first new lead singer for the group following Mayfield's departure, but success eluded the Impressions, and Hutson left the group in 1973.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=641/2}}</ref>  Jon French was the drummer for the touring band playing around the United States and Europe.  He is also heard on the recording of "Freddie's Dead".

===Later years, awards, and accolades===
New members Ralph Johnson and Reggie Torian replaced Hutson,<ref name="Larkin"/> and the Impressions had three R&B Top 5 singles in 1974&ndash;1975: the No. 1 "[[Finally Got Myself Together (I'm a Changed Man)]]" (which also reached the Pop top 20) and the No. 3 singles "Same Thing it Took" and "Sooner or Later". In 1975, the Impressions had their sole British hit, when "First Impressions" reached No. 16 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="Larkin"/> In 1976, the Impressions left Curtom and Mayfield behind for [[Cotillion Records]] and had their final major hit with "Loving Power".  The same year, Ralph Johnson was replaced by Nate Evans, who remained in the group for three years, during which time the Impressions switched to [[20th Century Records]].  Singles and albums sales continued to slip, and Evans left in 1979, reducing the group to a trio. Evans temporarily rejoined for the album ''Fan the Fire'', released in 1981.

Reggie Torian left in 1983.  Ralph Johnson rejoined that year, as well as new member Vandy Hampton.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusichq.com/artists/impress.htm |title=Impressions |publisher=Soulmusichq.com |access-date=2011-11-08}}</ref><ref name="soulmusichq">{{cite web|url=http://www.soulmusichq.com/goodbye.htm |title=Soul Music HQ The Drifters |publisher=Soulmusichq.com |access-date=2011-11-08}}</ref>  This lineup recorded with [[Eric Clapton]] on his ''[[Reptile (album)|Reptile]]'' album.

The Impressions were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1991 and into the [[Vocal Group Hall of Fame]] in 2003.  The members who became Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees were the original Roosters/Impressions lineup:  Sam Gooden, Jerry Butler, Richard Brooks, Curtis Mayfield, Arthur Brooks, and Fred Cash.

Mayfield was paralyzed from the neck down after lighting equipment fell on him during a live performance at Wingate Field in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], on August 13, 1990.  Despite this, he continued his career as a recording artist, releasing his final album ''[[New World Order (album)|New World Order]]'' in 1997.  Mayfield won a [[Grammy Legend Award]] in 1994 and a [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]] in 1995 and was a double inductee into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]], as a member of the Impressions in 1991 and again in 1999 as a solo artist.  He was also a two-time [[Grammy Hall of Fame]] inductee.  He died from complications of [[type 2 diabetes]] in 1999 at the age of 57.

Johnson left in 2001 and was replaced by Willie Kitchens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.williekitchens.com/impressions1.htm |title=williekitchens.com |publisher=williekitchens.com |access-date=2011-11-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008012336/http://www.williekitchens.com/impressions1.htm |archive-date=2011-10-08 }}</ref>  This lineup was featured on the [[PBS]] specials ''R&B 40'' and ''Soul and Inspiration''.  Hampton was released in 2003 and died in 2005.<ref name="soulmusichq" />  Reggie Torian later returned, replacing Kitchens.  The Impressions recorded a tribute album to Curtis Mayfield in 2000, which was released by Edel America.  In 2008 Universal Music & Hip O Records released ''Movin' On Up'' - the first-ever [[video]] compilation of the Impressions, featuring brand-new interviews with original Impressions members Sam Gooden and Fred Cash, along with taped interviews with the now-late Curtis Mayfield and video performances of the group's greatest hits and several of Mayfield's solo hits.  The group's first million-selling hit [[song]] "For Your Precious Love", featuring original lead singer [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]] on lead, is ranked No. 327, and their hit "People Get Ready" is ranked No. 24, on the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]].  Also, the Impressions' album/CD ''[[The Anthology 1961–1977]]'' is ranked at No. 179 on ''Rolling Stone'' magazine's list of [[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time]].

"People Get Ready" has also been chosen as one of the Top 10 Best Songs Of All Time by a panel of 20 top industry songwriters and producers, including [[Paul McCartney]], [[Brian Wilson]], [[Hal David]], and others, as reported to Britain's ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' music magazine.

===Re-emergence===
In 2011, the Impressions began a collaboration with German-born [[DJ Pari]] of the Soulpower organization, who managed their career until their retirement in 2018. They embarked to England for their first ever public performances at [[Barbican Centre]] in [[London]] and [[Bridgewater Hall]] in [[Manchester]], followed by a trip to [[Madrid]], Spain, in 2012. In July 2012, they performed at the official Curtis Mayfield 70th Birthday Tribute Concert at [[Avery Fisher Hall]] in [[New York City]]. In July 2013, the Impressions released "Rhythm!", their first single in over thirty years, on [[Daptone Records]].  The 7" record featured original members Fred Cash, Sam Gooden, and Reggie Torian and was produced by [[Binky Griptite]], guitarist for [[the Dap-Kings]]. "Rhythm!" was originally penned by Curtis Mayfield in the mid-sixties (and recorded by [[Major Lance]]).  The B-side, "Star Bright," was written by Binky Griptite.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Impressions "Rhythm!" b/w "Star Bright"|url=https://daptonerecords.com/shop/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=308|work=Daptone Records|access-date=11 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313091156/https://daptonerecords.com/shop/index.php?route=product%2Fproduct&product_id=308|archive-date=13 March 2014}}</ref>

In August 2013, former Impressions member [[Leroy Hutson]] filed a complaint against [[Young Jeezy]] and others alleging that Young Jeezy's song "Time" inappropriately incorporated the instrumental portion of the Impressions "Getting it On", which was registered with the [[United States Copyright Office]] in 1973.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Preston H Heard |author2= Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice, PLLC|title=Singer-Songwriter Lee Hutson Sues Rapper Young Jeezy Over Alleged Use of "Getting It On" Sample|journal=The [[National Law Review]]|date=6 September 2013|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/singer-songwriter-lee-hutson-sues-rapper-young-jeezy-over-alleged-use-getting-it-sam|access-date=18 May 2014}}</ref>
