{{Greek myth}}

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Daedalus''' ([[Help:IPA/English|/ˈdɛdələs ˈdiːdələs ˈdeɪdələs/]]; [[Greek language|Greek]]: Δαίδαλος; [[Latin language|Latin]]: ''Daedalus''; [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]]: ''Taitale'') was a skillful architect and craftsman, seen as a symbol of wisdom, knowledge and power. He is the father of [[Icarus]], the uncle of [[Perdix (mythology)|Perdix]], and possibly also the father of [[Iapyx]]. Among his most famous creations are the wooden bull for [[Pasiphaë]], the [[Labyrinth]] for King [[Minos]] of [[Crete]] which imprisoned the [[Minotaur]], and wings that he and his son Icarus used to escape Crete. It was during this escape that Icarus did not heed his father's warnings and flew too close to the sun; the wax holding his wings together melted and Icarus fell to his death.

==Epigraphic evidence==
The name ''Daidalos'' appears to be attested in [[Linear B]], a writing system used to record [[Mycenaean Greek]]. The name appears in the form ''da-da-re-jo-de'', possibly referring to a sanctuary.<ref>Wachter, Rudolf.

== Inventor, architect, artist ==
Daedalus is first mentioned in roughly 1400 BC on the Knossian Linear B tablets.  He is later mentioned by Homer as the creator of the Shield of Achilles. The shield was said to have an image of a dancing floor like the one built by Daedalus for [[Ariadne]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andrew Stewart, One Hundred Greek Sculptors, Their Careers and Extant Works, The Sculptors, The Archaic Period|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0008:part=2:chapter=1&highlight=daedalus|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> It is clear that Daedalus was not an original character of Homer's. Rather, Homer was referencing mythology that his audience was already familiar with.<ref>Robin Lane Fox, ''Travelling Heroes in the Epic Age of Homer'', 2009:187, 178.</ref>
[[File:Daedalic torso of kore, Eleutherna, 7th century BC, AMH, 145400.jpg|left|thumb|Upper body of a Daedalic statue of a Kore, poros stone. Eleftherna, archaic period, 7th century BC.]]
Daedalus is not mentioned again in literature until the fifth century BC, but he is widely praised as an inventor, artist, and architect, though classical sources disagree on which inventions exactly are attributable to him. In [[Pliny's Natural History]] (7.198) he is credited with inventing carpentry, including tools like the axe, saw, glue, and more.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andrew Stewart, One Hundred Greek Sculptors, Their Careers and Extant Works, The Sculptors, The Archaic Period|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0008:part=2:chapter=1&highlight=daedalus|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> Supposedly, he first invented masts and sails for ships for the navy of King Minos. He is also said to have carved statues so spirited they appeared to be living and moving.<ref>William Godwin (1876). "Lives of the Necromancers". p. 40.</ref> [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], in traveling around Greece, attributed to Daedalus numerous archaic wooden [[Cult figure|cult figures]] (see ''[[Xoanon|xoana]]'') that impressed him. In fact, so many other statues and artworks are attributed to Daedalus by Pausanias and various other sources that likely many of them were never made by him.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Andrew Stewart, One Hundred Greek Sculptors, Their Careers and Extant Works, The Sculptors, The Archaic Period|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0008:part=2:chapter=1&highlight=daedalus|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

Daedalus gave his name, [[Eponym|eponymously]], to many Greek craftsmen and many Greek contraptions and inventions that represented dextrous skill. A specific sort of early Greek sculptures are named Daedalic sculpture in his honor.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Daedalic sculpture|url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Daedalic-sculpture|access-date=2021-06-07|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> In [[Boeotia]] there was a festival, the [[Daedala]], in which a temporary wooden altar was fashioned and an effigy was made from an oak-tree and dressed in bridal attire. It was carried in a cart with a woman who acted as bridesmaid. The image was called daedala''.''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, chapter 3|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0160:book=9:chapter=3&highlight=daedala|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> Some sources claim that the daedala did not receive their name from Daedalus, but the opposite. [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] claims that Daedalus was not the name given to the inventor at birth, but that he was named so later after the daedala.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Pausanias, Description of Greece, Boeotia, chapter 3|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0160:book=9:chapter=3&highlight=daedala|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the idea of a rival. His sister had placed her son under his charge to be taught the mechanical arts as an apprentice. His nephew is named variously as [[Perdix (mythology)|Perdix]], Talos, or Calos, although some sources say that Perdix was the name of Daedalus' sister.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apollodorus, Library, book 3, chapter 15, section 8|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Apollod.%203.15.8&lang=original|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> The nephew showed striking evidence of ingenuity. Finding the spine of a fish on the seashore, he took a piece of iron and notched it on the edge, and thus invented the saw.

===The Labyrinth===
Daedalus created the [[Labyrinth]] on [[Crete]], in which the [[Minotaur]] was kept. 
[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Pasiphae.jpg|left|thumb|Daedalus and [[Pasiphaë]]. Roman fresco in the [[House of the Vettii]], [[Pompeii]], first century AD]]
[[Poseidon]] had given a white bull to [[Minos|King Minos]] to use it as a sacrifice. Instead, the king kept the bull for himself and sacrificed another. As revenge, Poseidon, with the help of [[Aphrodite]], made King Minos's wife, [[Pasiphaë]], lust for the bull. Pasiphaë asked Daedalus to help her. Daedalus built a hollow, wooden cow, covered in real cow hide for Pasiphaë, so she could mate with the bull. As a result, Pasiphaë gave birth to the [[Minotaur]], a creature with the body of a man, but the face of a bull. King Minos ordered the Minotaur to be imprisoned and guarded in the Labyrinth built by Daedalus for that purpose.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apollodorus, Library, book 3, chapter 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Library:book=3:chapter=1&highlight=minotaur|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>
[[File:Daedalus escapes (iuvat evasisse).jpg|thumb|231x231px|''Daedalus escapes (iuvat evasisse)'' by Johann Christoph Sysang (1703-1757)]]
In the story of the Labyrinth as told by the [[Greeks#Hellenes|Hellenes]], the Athenian hero [[Theseus]] is challenged to kill the Minotaur, finding his way back out with the help of [[Ariadne|Ariadne's thread]]. It is Daedalus himself who gives Ariadne the clue as to how to escape the labyrinth.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apollodorus, Epitome, book E, chapter 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Epitome:book=E:chapter=1&highlight=daedalus|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

Ignoring Homer, later writers envisaged the Labyrinth as an edifice rather than a single dancing path to the center and out again, and gave it numerous winding passages and turns that opened into one another, seeming to have neither beginning nor end. [[Ovid]], in his ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'', suggests that Daedalus constructed the Labyrinth so cunningly that he himself could barely escape it after he built it.<ref>Penelope Reed Doob, ''The Idea of the Labyrinth: From Classical Antiquity through the Middle Ages'', 1992:36, [[ISBN (identifier)|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/0-8014-8000-0|0-8014-8000-0]].</ref>

Since Minos controlled the land routes as well, Daedalus set to work to make wings for himself and his son Icarus. Using bird feathers of various sizes, thread, and wax, he shaped them to resemble a bird's wings. When both were prepared for flight, Daedalus warned Icarus not to fly too high, because the heat of the sun would melt the wax, nor too low, because the sea foam would soak the feathers and make them heavy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphoses, Book 8, line 183|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Ov.+Met.+8.183-235&fromdoc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0028|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref>

They had passed [[Samos]], [[Delos]] and [[Lebynthos]], and the boy, forgetting himself, began to soar upward toward the sun. The blazing sun melted and softened the wax that held the feathers together and they fell off one by one. Losing his wings, Icarus fell in the sea and drowned. Daedalus wept, lamenting his own arts, and took Icarus's body and buried it. He called the island near the place where Icarus fell into the ocean [[Icaria]], in the memory of his son.<ref>{{Cite web|title=P.

=== The shell riddle ===
After burying Icarus, Daedalus traveled to Camicus in [[Sicily]], where he stayed as a guest under the protection of King Cocalus.<ref>{{Cite web|title=P. Ovidius Naso, Metamorphoses, Book 8, line 260|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0028:book=8:card=260|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> There Daedalus built a temple to [[Apollo (god)|Apollo]], and hung up his wings as an offering to the god. In an invention of [[Virgil]] ([[Aeneid]] VI), Daedalus flies to [[Cumae]] and founds his temple there, rather than in Sicily.<ref>author, Virgil. ''The Aeneid''. [[ISBN (identifier)|ISBN]] [[Special:BookSources/978-0-300-25875-2|<bdi>978-0-300-25875-2</bdi>]]. [[OCLC (identifier)|OCLC]] 1231607822.</ref>

[[Minos]], meanwhile, searched for Daedalus by traveling from city to city asking a riddle. He presented a spiral seashell and asked for a string to be run through it. When he reached Camicus, King Cocalus, knowing Daedalus would be able to solve the riddle, accepted the shell and gave it to Daedalus. Daedalus tied the string to an ant which, lured by a drop of honey at one end, walked through the seashell stringing it all the way through. With the riddle solved, Minos realized that Daedalus was in the court of King Cocalus and insisted he be handed over. Cocalus agreed to do so, but convinced Minos to take a bath first. In the bath, Cocalus' daughters killed Minos, possibly by pouring boiling water over his body.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Apollodorus, Epitome, book E, chapter 1|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0022:text=Epitome:book=E:chapter=1&highlight=daedalus|access-date=2021-06-07|website=www.perseus.tufts.edu}}</ref> In some versions, it's Cocalus that kills Minos in the bath.<ref>{{Cite web|title=W.

The anecdotes are literary and late. However, in the founding tales of the Greek colony of [[Gela]], founded in the 680s BC on the southwest coast of Sicily, a tradition was preserved that the Greeks had seized [[Cult image|cult images]] wrought by Daedalus from their local predecessors, the [[Sicani]].<ref>[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], viii.46.2, ix.40.3-4; T.J.

== Later depictions in art and literature ==
Daedalus and the myths associated with him are often depicted in paintings, sculptures, and more by later artists. The myth about his flight and the fall of Icarus is especially popular in depictions.
