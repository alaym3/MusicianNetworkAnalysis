==Career==
Krizz Kaliko began his musical career in the late 1990s when he began working with local producer IcyRoc Kraven. Another local rapper by the name of Tech N9ne was also collaborating with IcyRoc at the time, which led to the two rappers meeting. At the time, Tech N9ne was working on a song titled "Who You Came To See" and Kaliko made a comment that the song could have a better hook. Tech offered up the opportunity to prove his case, and Tech was blown away when Kaliko did. Tech would bring Kaliko into his "inner circle", which would eventually result in Kaliko signing to the new-found label Strange Music co-owned by Tech N9ne and Travis O'Guin.

Since then, Kaliko has often contributed to albums put out by Tech N9ne, be it being featured as a rapper or simply providing background vocals for tracks on the album. Although most of his work is that of his collaborations with Tech N9ne, he has also performed similar tasks for former labelmates [[Kutt Calhoun]], [[Rittz]], and fellow labelmates [[Skatterman & Snug Brim]], [[Ces Cru]], and [[Prozak (rapper)|Prozak]]. Other collaborations include tracks with the [[Kottonmouth Kings]], [[Potluck (group)|Potluck]], [[E-40]], [[T-Pain]], [[Twiztid]], [[Andy Mineo]], [http://chrisbtv.com/ Chris B], and [[RM (rapper)|RM from South Korean group BTS]] .<ref>{{Citation|last=Chris B|title=Chris B - Only Human Feat.
