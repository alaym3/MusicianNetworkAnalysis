Maxim Nucci was born in [[Créteil]], an eastern suburb of Paris, on 23 February 1979. He entered the conservatory of music at the age of six, and learned to play the piano and the guitar. When he was 15, he began to attend classes at the Musician Institute of London. After graduation, he became the youngest teacher of the academy in 1994.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}{{clarify|reason=This says that he began studying at AND graduated from the Musician Institute of London AND became its youngest teacher all in the same year, 1994, the year he turned 15. Seems VERY unlikely.|date=October 2018}}

Nucci had been playing with his band, Max, in England when he sent a demo to several record labels.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} [[Universal Music France]] expressed interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.premiere.fr/Star/Maxim-NUCCI |title=Maxim NUCCI – News & actus people sur Premiere |language=fr |publisher=Premiere.fr |access-date=2011-04-14}}</ref>

Nucci appeared on television during 2001. He partly composed the first album by [[L5 (band)|L5]]–a female band created during a popular reality TV show, ''[[Popstars]]''. He also helped the debut singers in recording their album.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

His first single "Dis à l'amour".

In 2004, he starred as an actor and a composer in ''Alive'', directed by Frédéric Berthe, in which a producer works with a gifted young songwriter and they find success together. The film was not a box-office success.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}
