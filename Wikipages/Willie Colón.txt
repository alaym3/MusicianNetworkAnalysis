'''William Anthony Colón Román''' (born April 28, 1950) is a Puerto Rican [[salsa music|salsa]] musician and social activist. He began his career as a [[trombone|trombonist]], and also sings, writes, produces, and acts.  He is also involved in the politics of New York City.<ref name="elespectador">{{cite web|url=http://www.elespectador.com/noticias/politica/articulo-223158-hugo-chavez-ahora-se-enfrenta-willie-colon |title=Hugo Chávez ahora se enfrenta a Willie Colón |publisher=Elespectador.Com |date=2010-09-07 |access-date=2014-08-09}}</ref>

==Early years==
Colón was born in the [[South Bronx, New York]], to Puerto Rican parents. He picked up the trumpet from a young age, and later switched to trombone, inspired by the all-trombone sound of [[Mon Rivera]] and [[Barry Rogers]]. He spent some summers at his maternal grandmother's sister's farm in the outskirts of [[Manatí, Puerto Rico]] on the road to neighboring [[Ciales|Ciales, Puerto Rico]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FatJo80g7E4C&q=willie+colon+manati&pg=PA90 |title=The Rhythms: Portable Lower East Side |date= 1994-09-20|access-date=2010-05-03|isbn=978-0-8021-3408-0|author1=Hollander, Kurt}}</ref>

At the age of 15, he was signed to [[Fania Records]], and at 17, he recorded his first album, which ultimately sold more than 300,000 copies. The main record producer at Fania at the time, [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] [[Johnny Pacheco]], recommended [[Héctor Lavoe]] to him.<ref>{{cite web|author=Izzy Sanabria |url=http://www.salsamagazine.com/index.php?page=14 |title=The Hector LaVoe Story by Izzy Sanabria |publisher=Salsamagazine.com |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref>

He has also acted in films, including roles in ''[[Vigilante (film)|Vigilante]]'' (1983), ''[[The Last Fight (film)|The Last Fight]]'' (1983), [[Miami Vice]] (in the  season 3 episode "Cuba Libre") (1987) and ''[[It Could Happen to You (1994 film)|It Could Happen to You]]'' (1994).

Colón has been a civil rights, community, and political activist since the age of 16. He has served as a member of the [[Latino Commission on AIDS]] and President of the Arthur Schomburg Coalition for a Better New York, member of the Board of Directors of the [[Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chci.org/ |title=Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute |publisher=Chci.org |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref> In 1995, Mr. Colón became the first person of color to serve on the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) national board, replacing Stephen Sondheim, and was also a member of the [[ASCAP Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home2.nyc.gov/html/lmec/html/commissioners/wcolon.shtml |title=LMEC Commissioners – Latin Media and Entertainment Commission |publisher=Home2.nyc.gov |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ascap.com/about/board-intro.html |title=ASCAP Board |publisher=Ascap.com |date=2006-04-01 |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref>

==Music career==
Beyond the trombone, he has also worked as a composer, arranger, and singer, and eventually as a producer and director. Combining elements of jazz, rock, and salsa, his work incorporates the rhythms of traditional music from African descendants in Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, representing mostly a one-way flow from Puerto Rico to the New York-based diaspora.<ref name=flores>{{cite journal |last=Flores |first=Juan |date=Fall 2004 |title=Creolité in the 'Hood: Diaspora as Source and Challenge |journal=Centro |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=282–293 |url=http://www.centropr.org/documents/journals/JFlores(p.282-293).pdf |access-date=2008-08-18}}</ref>  "His life and music commute back and forth between his home turf in the Bronx and his ancestral Puerto Rico, with more than casual stop-offs in other musical zones of the Caribbean."<ref name=flores/> Colón "makes the relation between diaspora and Caribbean homeland the central theme of his work," particularly in his 1971 Christmas album, ''Asalto Navideño''.<ref name=flores/> The lyrics and music of the songs on this album "enact the diaspora addressing the island culture in a complex, loving but at the same time mildly challenging way."<ref name=flores/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5WdvhYQv1wI |title=Traigo la Salsa |publisher=YouTube |date=2006-11-26 |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref>

[[File:Wac bataclan 2018 wave crowd.png|thumb|right|On July 12, 2018, Willie Colón became the first Latin artist to perform at Paris' Bataclan theater after the 2015 terrorist attack.]]

He went on to have many successful collaborations with other salsa musicians and singers, such as [[Ismael Miranda]], [[Celia Cruz]], [[Soledad Bravo]], and singer-songwriter [[Rubén Blades]].<ref name="Fania Records">{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0173138/|title=Rubén Blades|publisher=IMDb.bom|access-date=2012-09-20}}</ref> On his website, Colón claims to hold the "all time record for sales in the Salsa genre, [having] created 40 productions that have sold more than thirty million records worldwide."<ref name="WillieColon.com - english section">{{cite web |url=http://williecolon.com/English/home.html |title=english section |publisher=WillieColon.com |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref>

One significant overarching theme in Colón's music, which draws from many cultures and several different styles, is an exploration of the competing associations that Puerto Ricans have with their home and with the United States. He uses his songs to depict and investigate the problems of living in the United States mainland as a Puerto Rican,<ref>{{cite journal |last=González |first=Lisa Sánchez |date=April 1999 |title=Reclaiming Salsa |journal=Cultural Studies |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=237–250 |doi=10.1080/095023899335266}}</ref> and also to imply the cultural contributions that Puerto Ricans have to offer.<ref name=flores/>

In May 2007 Willie Colon sued Ruben Blades for breach of contract. This led to a series of suits and countersuits that lasted over five years. A book titled "Decisiones" detailing the inside story of the legal battle was written by Blades' former agent, Robert J. Morgalo, and published in 2016 in both English and Spanish [http://www.decisionesbook.com website].The court documents can be read [http://www.decisionesbook.com/documentation/documentation here] and full transcripts of depositions and court rulings can be seen [http://www.decisionesbook.com/documentation/depositions-and-transcripts here]

Colón released two singles, "Amor de Internet" and "Corazón Partido" to promote for his album ''El Malo Vol II: Prisioneros del Mambo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://williecolon.com/English/download.html |title=download page |publisher=WillieColon.com |access-date=2010-05-03}}</ref> In 2016, Colón began his 50th Anniversary Tour. In 2017, Colón announced his upcoming book titled ''Barrio de Guapos'' (''The Secret Life of Willie Colón'') and the launching of his record label Willie Colon Presents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/articulo/espectaculos/musica/2017/07/1/willie-colon-aun-no-para-de-gozar|title=Willie Colón aún no para de gozar|date=July 1, 2017}}</ref> For 2018 Colón kicked off his "Rumba Del Siglo" (Jam of the Century) World Tour performing in U.S., Latin America and Europe to mostly sold-out venues. Because of the great success of his last tour, Colón will continue "Rumba Del Siglo 2019" (Jam of the Century 2019).

Stylistically they are poles apart, Dorsey representing an ultra-smooth approach, Colón a Hard-edged roughness reportedly inspired by [[Barry Rogers]]. Unfortunately, Colón's public is largely Latino, so his music and contribution have gone unnoticed or ignored by the general press"- Gerald Sloan, professor of music [[University of Arkansas]].<ref name="ITA Journal">[https://www.trombone.net/wp-content/plugins/trombone-journal/issueviewer.php?iss=129] {{dead link|date=February 2021}}</ref>
