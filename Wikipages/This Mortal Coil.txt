==Background==
Watts-Russell had founded 4AD in 1980, and the label established itself as one of the key labels in the British [[post-punk]] movement. Following several releases, Watts-Russell developed the idea of collaborating under the name This Mortal Coil.<ref name="Larkin80"/> The name is taken from lyrics to the song Dream Within A Dream by [[Spirit_(band)|Spirit]] ("...Stepping off this mortal coil will be my pleasure..."),<ref>{{cite web|last=Douridas |first=Chris |title=Morning Becomes Eclectic interview with Ivo Watts-Russell |url=https://www.kcrw.com/music/shows/morning-becomes-eclectic/ivo-watts-russel |website=KCRW |date=13 March 1998|access-date=16 March 2021}}</ref> which in turn is a [[Mortal coil|quote]] from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'' ("... what dreams may come, when we have shuffled off this mortal coil...").

Quoting the 4AD website:

{{Quotation|''This Mortal Coil was not a band, but a unique collaboration of musicians recording in various permutations, the brainchild of 4AD kingpin Ivo Watts-Russell. The idea was to allow artists the creative freedom to record material outside of the realm of what was expected of them; it also created the opportunity for innovative cover versions of songs personal to Ivo.''}}

One of the label's earliest signings was [[Modern English (band)|Modern English]]. In 1983, Watts-Russell suggested that the band re-record two of its earliest songs, "Sixteen Days" and "Gathering Dust", as a medley. At the time, the band was closing its set with this medley, and Watts-Russell felt it was strong enough to warrant a re-recording. When the band rebuffed the idea, Watts-Russell decided to assemble a group of musicians to record the medley: [[Elizabeth Fraser]] and [[Robin Guthrie]] of Cocteau Twins; [[Cindy Sharp]] of [[Cindytalk]]; and a few members of Modern English.<ref name="Larkin80">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Eighties Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=2003|edition=Third|isbn=1-85227-969-9|page=460}}</ref> An [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[Sixteen Days/Gathering Dust]]'', resulted from these sessions. A cover of [[Tim Buckley]]'s "[[Song to the Siren (Tim Buckley song)|Song to the Siren]]", performed by Fraser and Guthrie alone, was recorded as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] for the EP. Pleased with the results, Watts-Russell decided to make this the A-side of the 7" single version of the EP, and the song quickly became an underground hit, leading Watts-Russell to pursue the recording of a full album under the This Mortal Coil moniker, 1984's ''[[It'll End in Tears]]''.<ref name="Larkin80"/>

In June 1998, Watts-Russell began releasing albums in a similar vein to his TMC projects, under the name [[The Hope Blister]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>
