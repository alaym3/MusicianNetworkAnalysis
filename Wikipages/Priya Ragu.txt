== Career ==

After completing her secondary education, she became an accountant for [[Swiss International Air Lines]] and moved to [[Zurich]]. Although she became a technical buyer for the airline, she continued recording songs in her spare time.<ref name=":0" /> Despite her childhood experiences as a singer, her parents did not want her to become a full-fledged professional musician due to their strict and conservative attitudes. Her parents were strictly against [[Western music (North America)|western music]], MTV videos and pop songs which they considered to be obscene. She however practiced pop songs secretly at her room against her parents' wishes.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title="I trained hard to become more self-determined."|url=https://www.swisslife.com/en/home/hub/interview-priya-ragu.html|access-date=2021-08-27|website=Swiss Life Group|language=en}}</ref>

She moved to [[New York City|New York]] in 2017 for a period of 6 months in order to pursue her dream career in music.

During her temporary stay in the US, she collaborated with her brother via [[Skype]] as the latter was staying in Switzerland. Priya's brother encouraged her to record songs in Tamil and the duo named their album titled ''Ragu Wayy''.<ref name=":1" />
