He is best known for his 1967 album ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'' and for his collaborations with [[Brian Wilson]] and [[the Beach Boys]] (particularly their unfinished album ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''). In addition to producing or arranging albums by [[Randy Newman]], [[Harry Nilsson]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Little Feat]], [[Happy End (band)|Happy End]], [[Ry Cooder]] and [[Joanna Newsom]], Parks has worked with performers such as [[Syd Straw]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[U2]], [[Grizzly Bear (band)|Grizzly Bear]], [[Inara George]], [[Kimbra]], [[Suzy Williams]] and [[Silverchair]].

Born in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], Parks spent his childhood studying clarinet, piano, and singing at the [[American Boychoir School]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]]. He started his professional career as a child actor. During the 1950s, he worked steadily in movies and television, and in the early 1960s, he majored in music at the [[Carnegie-Mellon University|Carnegie Institute of Technology]]. After dropping out of university in 1963, he relocated to [[Los Angeles]], where his first paid gig was arranging "[[The Bare Necessities]]" for the 1967 [[Disney]] film ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]''. Following this, he involved himself with the growing [[California sound|West Coast music scene]], subsequently playing with—or appearing on records by—acts like [[the Mothers of Invention]], [[the Byrds]], [[Judy Collins]], [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]], and [[Harpers Bizarre]]. His LP ''Song Cycle'' mixed a number of genres (including [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[ragtime]], and [[show tunes]]) and framed [[classical music|classical]] styles in the context of 1960s [[pop music]]. It was released to underwhelming sales, but attracted a [[cult following]] in later years.

Starting in the 1970s, Parks made repeated excursions into [[Afro-Caribbean music]], notably on his 1972 album ''[[Discover America]]'' and on records he produced for [[the Esso Trinidad Steel Band]] and [[Mighty Sparrow]]. At the same time, he managed the audio/visual department of [[Warner Bros. Records]], which was the earliest of its kind to produce [[music video]]s for artists. Since then, he established himself in motion pictures and over the years has directed, arranged, produced, and composed soundtracks for theatrical films and television shows such as ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'' (1980), ''[[Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird]]'' (1985), and ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'' (1987). Much of his later work has been in commissioned orchestral arrangements for lesser-known [[independent music|indie acts]].

==Early life==
Born in 1943 in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi]], as the youngest of four children, Parks spent time in [[Lake Charles, Louisiana]] during his childhood. His older brothers played brass instruments.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=32}} His father, Richard Hill Parks, was a doctor who served as chief psychiatric officer in the [[Dachau liberation reprisals]].<ref name="Seldom Seen Kid">{{cite journal|title=The Seldom Seen Kid|journal=Mojo|date=August 12, 2012|pages=55–57|url=http://www.bananastan.com/clippings.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817193223/http://bananastan.com/clippings.html|archive-date=August 17, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Having studied with [[Karl Menninger]], Richard's specific medical specialties were neurology and psychiatry, and he was the first doctor to admit African-American patients to a white southern hospital.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|pp=32–33}} Richard was also a part-time clarinetist and had a dance band to get through med school: Dick Parks and His White Swan Serenaders.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=33}}<ref name=may2011 /> Van Dyke's mother was a [[Hebraic]] scholar.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=32}}

Growing up, there were two grand pianos nestled in the family living room, and at age 4, Parks began studying the [[clarinet]].<ref name="may2011">{{YouTube|id=bq2-U9D2MaU|title=Van Dyke Parks Interview}}</ref> He attended the [[American Boychoir School]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], studying voice and piano,{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=33}} and would sing "[[George Gershwin|Gershwin]], [[Arnold Schoenberg|Schoenberg]], [[atonal music]], everything".<ref name="five">{{cite web|last=Dombal|first=Ryan|title=5–10–15–20: Van Dyke Parks The veteran songwriter and arranger on the Beach Boys, Bob Dylan, and more.|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/42269-5-10-15-20-van-dyke-parks/|work=Pitchfork|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514101025/http://pitchfork.com/news/42269-5-10-15-20-van-dyke-parks/|archive-date=May 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Parks also was a street urchin in ''[[La bohème]]'' at the [[Metropolitan Opera]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bellaunion.com/artists/van-dyke-parks/|title=Van Dyke Parks - Bella Union|website=bellaunion.com|access-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170825061139/http://bellaunion.com/artists/van-dyke-parks/|archive-date=August 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and sang the title role in ''[[Amahl and the Night Visitors]]'' at [[New York City Opera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/van-dyke-parks-has-a-lot-to-say|title=Van Dyke Parks Has a Lot to Say|date=November 7, 2013|website=vice.com|access-date=May 9, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044725/http://noisey.vice.com/blog/van-dyke-parks-has-a-lot-to-say|archive-date=March 4, 2016|df=mdy-all}}</ref> During his childhood, Parks became extremely fond of old-style [[Americana (music)|American music]], most notably the sounds of [[Tin Pan Alley]]. This interest in [[Great Depression|Depression-era]] songwriting correlated heavily with his artistic goals and interests during the 1960s and beyond. He was also deeply affected by musicians [[Spike Jones]] and [[Les Paul]], which led him to develop an interest with studio experimentation in the form of pop music.<ref name=five /><ref name=fireside /><ref name="billboard 2013">{{cite web|last=Gallo|first=Phil|title=Van Dyke Parks Takes Artful Approach on First Solo Album in Decades|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/4435130/van-dyke-parks-takes-artful-approach-on-first-solo-album-in-decades|work=Billboard|access-date=July 26, 2013|date=July 25, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130726225948/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/4435130/van-dyke-parks-takes-artful-approach-on-first-solo-album-in-decades|archive-date=July 26, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Parks has said that the first record he ever purchased may have been [[Dean Martin]]'s "[[Memories Are Made of This]]."<ref name=may2011/>

==Music career==
===1960s===
[[File:Van Dyke Parks 1967.png|thumb|Parks in late 1967]]
Upon dropping out of Carnegie Tech in early 1963, Parks relocated to Los Angeles with the intent of being involved with the growing West Coast [[beatnik]] subculture and to play with his older brother [[Carson Parks]] as the Steeltown Two (later enlarged to three), which eventually became the [[Folk music|folk]] group the Greenwood County Singers. The group included future [[RCA Records]] producer and recording artist [[Rick Jarrard]]. Parks later said of this decision, "Going to California meant I escaped [[John Cage]]. I escaped the abstractions, the music you can't remember, the highbrow angst."<ref name="Seldom Seen Kid" /> The two Parks brothers performed together at various coffeehouses around [[San Diego]], [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], and San Francisco.<ref name="BOMB Magazine" /> One of the people in attendance at a Santa Barbara performance turned out to be future [[The Byrds|Byrds]] member [[David Crosby]], who at the time remarked to friend [[David Lindley (musician)|David Lindley]], "If they can get away with it, so can we."<ref name="Seldom Seen Kid" /><ref name="Prism Films">{{cite web|title=Van Dyke Parks interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6U0hwQ75QU|work=Prism Films|publisher=prismfilms.co.uk|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407104617/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n6U0hwQ75QU|archive-date=April 7, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref> While in California, Parks attempted to land a job performing on the television show ''[[Art Linkletter's House Party]]'' but was not accepted.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=35}} Parks took a short hiatus from this group, briefly moving to New England{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} to be part of the Brandywine Singers,<ref name="tim">{{cite journal|last=White|first=Timothy|journal=Musician Magazine|title=Van Dyke Parks|date=February 1985}}</ref> earning up to $3,000 a week.<ref name=sodajerker/>

In 1963, his older brother Benjamin Parks, a [[French horn]] player, was killed in an auto accident in Frankfurt while working for the US [[State Department]] in Germany, one day before his 24th birthday.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=37}}<ref name=dorian /> [[Terry Gilkyson]] informed Parks of the news and, to help make up for it, hired Parks as an arranger for his song "[[The Bare Necessities]]", which was later featured in the [[Disney]] animated feature ''[[The Jungle Book]]''.{{sfn|Henderson|2010|p=37}}

Parks reacted strongly to [[Beatlemania]]. Of it, he claimed, "I lived under a billboard that said '[[The Beatles]] is coming,' and I got the sense that it was a plague, and that it was going to have cultural implication throughout the world.&nbsp;... It's almost like the [[Vestigiality|vestigial functions]], the appendixes of the musical life that I had just begun to have a scant association with were being excised from the body of music with the advent of folk music gone electric. So I started to learn piano."<ref name=barney /> He has repeatedly stated his annoyance with contemporary pop music during the mid-1960s and the culture's increasing [[anglophilia]], going so far as to say, "apart from ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' I didn't find anything striking coming out of the United States."<ref name="tim"/><ref name="barney"/> However, he had a favorable opinion of [[Bob Dylan]]'s ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]'', and Parks has said to have been impressed with Dylan's "speaking-voice" style. Accordingly, "I also looked at his written lyrics and realized that he didn't capitalize his letters. He was trying to copy [[e.e. cummings]] and, while it was transparently imitative, I thought it was a good position."<ref name="five" />{{listen|

Parks has said that while bass player Hal Brown of the Brandywine Singers took him sightseeing around a decrepit "almost-[[ghost town]]", the two had a chance encounter with the San Francisco group [[The Charlatans (American band)|the Charlatans]] in an old [[Bar (establishment)|saloon]]. The group derided the 21-year-old Parks for his "[[preppy]]" and "[[square (slang)|square]]" appearance, and Parks responded by showing off a song he had recently written named "High Coin", which impressed the group so much that they asked if they could record it. Parks agreed, and the Charlatans' version of "High Coin" received much [[airplay]] in San Francisco, which established Parks within the hippie counterculture.<ref name=sodajerker>{{cite web|title=EPISODE 51 – VAN DYKE PARKS|url=http://www.sodajerker.com/episode-51-van-dyke-parks/|work=Sodajerker|access-date=January 1, 2014|date=January 1, 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102195817/http://www.sodajerker.com/episode-51-van-dyke-parks/|archive-date=January 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Soon after, Parks quit the Brandywine Singers and signed an artist contract with [[MGM Records]], for which he recorded the singles "[[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Number Nine]]" and "[[Come to the Sunshine]]", which did not succeed commercially.

|quote=[Brian Wilson] was the force. Real convincing. He made music that could be enjoyed beyond its time. [[Phil Spector]] meant nothing to me—I thought his sound was just smoke and mirrors. People who said ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' was bastardizing classical music led very sheltered childhoods. That's a bunch of bullshit. Brian Wilson was not imitative, he was inventive; for people who don't write songs, it's hard to understand how inventive he really was.

Parks initially became aware of the Beach Boys during their early popularity in the early 1960s. Speaking of them in 1995, he said, "I knew they didn't surf.…I felt some resentment about [them], and I had been a fan of ''[[Four Freshmen and 5 Trombones]]''.…Instinctively, I was not a Beach Boy fan. 'Something really dumb about it.'" He added that, "I loved ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', you see. I came back to love them, and thought they had done a great job.

Wilson's (since-discredited) 1991 memoir, ''[[Wouldn't It Be Nice: My Own Story]]'', suggested that he had met Parks, or had heard of him, through an unnamed mutual friend in December 1964.{{sfn|Carter|2016|p=188}} Author David McGowan suggests that the friend may have been [[Lorren Daro|Loren Schwartz]], who had supervised Wilson's first LSD trip.{{sfn|McGowan|2014|p=254}} According to Parks, Wilson "sought me out" after he had heard about him through mutual friends, "a neighborly couple" that experimented with psychedelic drugs. "People who experimented with psychedelics—no matter who they were—were viewed as 'enlightened people,' and Brian sought out the enlightened people."{{sfn|White|1996|p=267}}

In Wilson's 1991 memoir, it was written that his first impressions of Parks was "a skinny kid with a unique perspective" and that he "had a fondness for [[amphetamines]]" at the time. Parks hesitantly confirmed this, but added, "Those were ''his'' amphetamines. They were in ''his'' medicine cabinet. I'd never had amphetamines. I was working for Brian Wilson at 3:30 AM when he wanted to have his amphetamines."<ref name=barney /> It was also Parks who introduced Wilson to Beatles publicist [[Derek Taylor]], who later became the Beach Boys' publicist for some time during the 1960s.<ref name="five"/>

====''Smile'' and collapse====
{{Further|Collapse of Smile}}
Unsatisfied with ''Pet Sounds'' collaborator [[Tony Asher]]'s lyrics for "[[Good Vibrations]]", Wilson first asked Parks to help him rewrite the lyrics to the song; Parks declined, stating that he didn't think he could improve on them.<ref name=barney /> During the recording of "Good Vibrations" in 1966, Parks claims to have suggested to Wilson while attending a session to have the cellist play [[triplet (music)|triplet notes]].<ref name=RBMA2013 /> Impressed by the results, Brian Wilson soon convinced Parks to write lyrics for the Beach Boys' next LP, the ambitious but ill-fated ''[[Smile (Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''. In preparation for the writing and recording of the album, Wilson purchased several thousand dollars' worth of [[marijuana]] and [[hashish]] for himself and his friends, including Parks.

In light of Wilson's increasingly fragile mental state, the group tensions, and his signing to [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], Parks's involvement in ''Smile'' effectively ceased after early 1967, when he left to begin work on his solo career. Giving his reasons, he said, "I walked away from the situation as soon as I realized that I was causing friction between him and his other group members, and I didn't want to be the person to do that. I thought that was Brian's responsibility to bring definition to his own life. I stepped in, perhaps, I 'took a leap before I looked'. I don't know, but that's the way I feel about it.…As soon as I found out I was entering an eat or be eaten situation... I was raised differently. I didn't want to be part of that game."<ref name="bobclast" /> Recording sessions ground to a halt soon after, as Wilson became increasingly withdrawn, and the album was shelved a few months later.<ref name="tim" /><ref name=barney />

====''Song Cycle'' and aftermath====
{{Main|Song Cycle (album)}}

Sometime in the mid-1960s, Parks visited [[Frank Sinatra]] while working at Warner Bros. Sinatra was dispirited by the rise of rock, and was considering retirement. To help alleviate this, Parks pitched his brother Carson's song "[[Somethin' Stupid]]" as a duet for Sinatra and his daughter [[Nancy Sinatra|Nancy]]. Purportedly on [[Lee Hazlewood]]'s advice, Sinatra recorded "Somethin' Stupid", and it became his first million-selling single. This bought credit for Parks at Warner Bros, and they proceeded to fund Parks's one single: a cover of Donovan's "[[Colours (Donovan song)|Colours]]", from his 1965 album ''[[Fairytale (album)|Fairytale]]''. It was credited to "George Washington Brown"—a fictitious pianist from South America—purportedly to protect his family from the potential infamy of his "musical criminology".<ref name=RBMA2013>{{cite web|title=Lecture: Van Dyke Parks (New York, 2013)|url=http://vimeo.com/66822387|publisher=Red Bull Music Academy|access-date=September 20, 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919093250/http://vimeo.com/66822387|archive-date=September 19, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> "Donovan's Colours" received an ecstatic two-page review by [[Richard Goldstein (writer born 1944)|Richard Goldstein]], which convinced the label of Parks's ability.<ref name="Seldom Seen Kid" />

description=By combining orchestral textures and traditional [[Americana (music)|Americana]]-meets-[[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] pop song structure, ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'' formally established Parks' signature approach of mining and updating old American musical traditions of [[Tin Pan Alley]] and [[Dixieland]].
|filetype=[[Ogg]]}}

In 1967, Parks completed his first solo album, ''[[Song Cycle (album)|Song Cycle]]'', produced by Lenny Waronker. Besides original compositions by Parks, ''Song Cycle'' includes interpretations of [[Randy Newman]]'s "Vine Street", Donovan's "Colours", and the traditional "[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]". The album's production reportedly cost more than US$35,000 (equal to US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|35000|1968|r=-4}}}} today), making it one of the most expensive pop albums ever recorded up to that time. It sold very poorly despite rave critical reviews but gained status as a cult album in later years. Shortly after ''Song Cycle'', Parks released a standalone 7" single: the A-side "The Eagle and Me" backed with "On The Rolling Sea When Jesus Speak To Me", which also sold poorly.

Parks has been critical of the [[flower power]] movement, which occurred toward the end of the decade, saying "Rock became a corporate classification, just like the blues. They took off its sexual organs. Some people got paid a lot of money to bottle the rebellion of the '60s, and that's when it started to mean zero to me." He added, "To me, 1969 really suggested the death knell of the [[counterculture of the 1960s|counter-culture]] revolution. The terrible event of [[Charles Manson]] showed the cultism of the period; I was always wary of crowds. I didn't go to [[Woodstock]]. I didn't want to be in a mudflat waiting to get into a portable toilet. I thought it was a terrible idea. So I stayed at my office at Warner Bros.…I don't even know what happened around then, for many reasons. One is I was working so hard and was too busy to really get totally turned around by what other people were doing."<ref name="five"/>

The aftermath of his work on ''Smile'' and ''Song Cycle'' left Parks wanting to focus more behind-the-scenes and with lesser-known artists, such as Randy Newman and [[Ry Cooder]], and expressed discontent with being "[[typecasting (acting)|typecast]]" by his songs.<ref name="Seldom Seen Kid" /> The [[1969 Santa Barbara oil spill]] was also life-altering for Parks and changed his "very reason for being". Sometime after, he met the [[Esso Trinidad Steel Band]], a Trinidadian [[calypso music|calypso]] band who had been performing with [[Liberace]] in Las Vegas. According to Parks, "I saw them as enslaved in their relationship to Liberace; I thought it was a vulgarity. I wanted to save them from their trivialization."<ref name="denise">{{cite web|last=Sullivan|first=Denise|title=The Day Van Dyke Parks Went Calypso...|url=http://bananastan.com/calypso.html|publisher=Bananastan|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210230620/http://bananastan.com/calypso.html|archive-date=December 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> What had begun as Parks's desire to popularize calypso at that point became his focal point, and he worked with the steel band for the next several years. Speaking about his life then, Parks stated, "My favorite group was the Esso Trinidad Steel Band, whom I worked with. I loved calypso all my life. I knew every Trinidadian in Hermosa Beach back then, there were probably about 20 families. Now there's a huge population."<ref name="five"/>

During the late 1960s, Parks became one of the first owners of a prototype [[Moog synthesizer]] and recorded a number of experimental advertising [[jingle]]s for various companies such as [[Datsun]] and the [[Ice Capades]].<ref name=RBMA2013 /> Parks plays the Moog on the [[Biff Rose]] song "Ain't No Great Day", from Rose's second LP, ''Children of Light''. Parks was also instrumental in the genesis of the 1970 album ''In a Wild Sanctuary'', by the [[electronic music|electronic]] outfit [[Beaver & Krause]]. While having lunch with the duo, Parks suggested that they record an ecological [[concept album]] through the use of [[field recording]]s and synthesizers.<ref>{{cite book|title=Sound & Communications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hMEpAQAAMAAJ|year=1994|publisher=Sound & Communications Publications|page=22}}</ref> Parks and Randy Newman helped the duo get signed to the Warner Bros. label.<ref>{{cite book|last=Unterberger|first=Richie|title=Liner notes for Beaver and Krause's in a Wild Sanctuary|url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/sanctuary.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924091145/http://www.richieunterberger.com/sanctuary.html|archive-date=September 24, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===1970s===
{{See also|Discover America|Clang of the Yankee Reaper}}
In 1972, Parks's travels to the [[West Indies]] inspired his second solo album, ''[[Discover America (album)|Discover America]]'', a tribute to the islands of [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and to calypso music. Parks re-arranged and re-produced obscure songs and calypso classics. Parks also produced the album ''Esso'' for the Esso Trinidad Steel Band in 1971. It was cultivated as a tribute to [[Prince Bernhard]], the head of the [[World Wildlife Fund]] at the time. According to Parks, "Everything was directed to making it a proper, political, green album."<ref name=denise/> This direction was continued in the 1975 release ''[[Clang of the Yankee Reaper]]''.

In the early 1970s, Parks was brought in to produce [[Happy End (1973 album)|the third album]] by seminal Japanese folk rock band [[Happy End (band)|Happy End]] while working on ''Discover America'' at [[Sunset Sound Recorders]]. He also helped with the writing for the closing track, {{nihongo|"Goodbye America, Goodbye Japan"|"さよならアメリカ　さよならニッポン"|"Sayonara America Sayonara Nippon"}}.<ref name="Blues"/> Sometime after, Parks became acquainted with member [[Haruomi Hosono]], who went on to be one of the founding members of the electronic band [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Parks went on to participate in a number of Hosono-related projects.<ref name=billboardlive/>

Although ''Smile'' had dissolved in mid-1967, Parks's collaborations with Wilson had not, for the time being. He was instrumental in getting the Beach Boys signed to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} and contributed vocally to "[[A Day in the Life of a Tree]]" and the writing of "[[Sail On, Sailor]]." Several songs with his lyrics, written during the ''Smile'' sessions, appeared on later Beach Boys albums, including "[[Surf's Up (song)|Surf's Up]]," "[[Heroes and Villains]]," and "[[Cabinessence]].'

In September 1970, Parks became head of the audio/visual department of [[Warner Bros.]] records.<ref>{{cite book| last = Hoskyns| first = Barney| title = Hotel California: The True-Life Adventures of Crosby, Stills, Nash, Young, Mitchell, Taylor, Browne, Ronstadt, Geffen, the Eagles, and Their Many Friends| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QiW3NAEACAAJ&pg=PA113| year = 2007| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| isbn = 978-0-470-12777-3| page = 113 }}</ref> This department was the earliest of its kind to record videos to promote records.<ref>{{cite book| author2 = Buckholtz, Charlie| last = Frank| first = Josh| title = In Heaven Everything Is Fine| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TGJslAEACAAJ&pg=PA103| date = August 2008| publisher = Free Press| location = New York| isbn = 978-1-4165-5120-1| page = 103 }}</ref> Parks made the department up by himself and had few employees at Warner Bros. Together they made more than a dozen promotional films documenting artists including [[Ry Cooder]], [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Randy Newman]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], and [[Captain Beefheart]].

Parks recorded only two albums during the 1970s, but he had performed on numerous albums recorded by friends who were working in or around the Los Angeles music scene—notably Harry Nilsson, whom Parks considered the "smartest guy" he had ever met in the music business.<ref name="five" /> During the early 1970s, Parks dealt with prescription drug abuse. He later spoke of himself as being "dead for five years", and he spent the first half of the decade "trying to regain an interest in living."<ref name="bobclast" /> Parks later stated, "When I was head of audio-visual services and on the A&R staff at Warner Bros., a man came into my office and he had a snake and his name was [[Alice Cooper|Alice]]. Right then, I knew that my days were numbered as a person really interested in the record business."<ref name="five" /> About his department during this time Parks stated, "I provided that each artist would get 25% of the net profits of the rentals or sales. It was going to be a very promising market for the artist. Warners soon grew tired of what I thought was a fair equation of participation in creative profits, and basically isolated me."<ref name="BOMB Magazine"/>

After ''Clang of the Yankee Reaper'', Parks quit his day job at Warner Bros. and "retreated from further record interests, seeking the more gregarious plain-speaking of the film community…with no less satisfaction."<ref name="bobclast" /> He spent the next several years, and most of the 1980s, focusing more on motion picture and television projects, writing scores for high-profile films, such as ''[[Popeye (film)|Popeye]]'', and serving as musical director for television programs such as ''[[Billy Crystal|The Billy Crystal Comedy Hour]]'', taking on as much work as he could to stay out of unemployment.<ref name="five" /><ref name="bobclast" />

===1980s===
{{See also|Jump! (album)|Tokyo Rose (album)}}
Parks made a slight comeback in 1984 with the album ''[[Jump! (album)|Jump!]]'', which featured songs adapted from the stories of [[Uncle Remus]] and [[Br'er Rabbit]]. The album exhibits a Broadway-style reduced orchestra with Americana additions, such as banjo, mandolin, and steel drums. Parks composed the album but did not arrange or produce it. Martin Kibbee contributed to the lyrics. Following up on the album, Parks wrote a series of children's books—''Jump'' (with Malcolm Jones), ''Jump Again'', and ''Jump On Over''—based on the [[Br'er Rabbit]] tales, illustrated by [[Barry Moser]], and loosely accompanied by Parks's own album ''[[Jump! (album)|Jump!]]''. The books contain sheet music for selected songs from the album. Parks also published a book called ''Fisherman & His Wife'' in 1991, which came packaged with a cassette.

By 1984, Parks was refused future collaborations with Wilson, instead being informed by an unnamed representative that "Mike Love is Brian Wilson's exclusive collaborator."<ref name="bobclast">{{cite web|last=Claster|first=Bob|title=A Visit With Van Dyke Parks|url=http://www.bobclaster.com/radioshows/Van%20Dyke%20Parks.mp3|work=Bob Claster's Funny Stuff|publisher=bobclaster.com|access-date=August 1, 2013|date=February 13, 1984|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914172619/http://www.bobclaster.com/radioshows/Van%20Dyke%20Parks.mp3|archive-date=September 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}} {{YouTube|id=8a7EjakxeCc|title=YouTube mirror}}</ref> Though Parks worked with the other Beach Boys on songs such as on "[[Kokomo (song)|Kokomo]]" and the album ''[[Summer in Paradise]]'', he did not work together with Wilson until a few years later, during the aborted album ''[[Sweet Insanity]]''.

He wrote "City Of Light", "It's A B-Movie", "Cutting Edge", and "Worthless", all of which were used in the film ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]'', directed by [[Jerry Rees]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} During the 1980s and 1990s, Parks grew considerably more active in arranging and producing albums by independent artists, which inspired him to return more fully to the music business.<ref name="five" />

Following ''Jump!'', in 1989 Warner Brothers released ''[[Tokyo Rose (album)|Tokyo Rose]]''. This concept album focuses on the history of Japanese-U.S. relations from the 19th century to the "trade war" at the time of its release. The songs are pop tunes with an orchestral treatment including Japanese instruments and old Parks Caribbean favorites like steel drums. The album did not sell well and was not widely noticed by critics. To promote the album, he performed some shows in Japan with musicians such as [[Haruomi Hosono]], [[Syd Straw]], harmonicist [[Tommy Morgan]], and steelpan player [[Yann Tomita]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sadanari.com/ongaku990824_05.html |title=♪♪ Sadanari Deluxe Discover !

{{See also|Orange Crate Art|Moonlighting: Live at the Ash Grove}}
Between 1992 and 1995, Parks teamed up again with a then-reclusive Brian Wilson to create the album ''[[Orange Crate Art]]''. Parks wrote all of the songs on the album, except "This Town Goes Down at Sunset" and George Gershwin's instrumental "Lullaby", with vocals by Wilson. ''Orange Crate Art'' is a tribute to the [[Southern California]] of the early 1900s and a lyrical tribute to the beauty of [[Northern California]]. It was recorded during a stressful period for Wilson, after being involved in court orders relating to years of psychiatric misconduct to which he had been subject. According to Parks, "When I found him, he was alone in a room staring at a television. It was off." The album was met with poor commercial reception, much to the disappointment of Parks.<ref name=dorian />

1998 saw the release of Parks's first live album, ''[[Moonlighting: Live at the Ash Grove]]'', which shows a love of the work of 19th-century American pianist [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], as well as performances of several of Parks' better-known and lesser-known songs. The live ensemble includes [[Sid Page]] as concertmaster.

===2000s===
[[File:WilsonParksSmilePremiere.jpg|thumb|right|Van Dyke Parks and Brian Wilson onstage at the "Brian Wilson Presents SMiLE" premiere in London in 2004.]]

Parks's association with Australian rock band [[Silverchair]] began with his work on their fourth studio album ''[[Diorama (Silverchair album)|Diorama]]'' in 2002. Parks was attracted to the music of lead singer and guitarist Daniel Johns and has stated that what most attracted him to the band was Johns' courage. He composed orchestral arrangements for Silverchair's fifth album ''[[Young Modern]]'' album in 2007. Daniel Johns, the band's lead singer, traveled to [[Prague]] with Parks to have the arrangements recorded by the [[Czech Philharmonic Orchestra]]. The album's title is a nickname Parks uses for Johns.

Parks was contacted by Wilson in 2003 to help with preparing a live performance of ''[[Brian Wilson Presents Smile|Smile]]''. He agreed, and the duo re-recorded the album and then presented it on a world tour, beginning with the world premiere performance at the Royal Festival Hall in London, which Parks attended. Parks later provided some lyrics to ''[[That Lucky Old Sun (A Narrative)|That Lucky Old Sun]]'', released in 2008. The album once again featured almost completely new compositions written by Brian Wilson, but with minimum input from Parks compared to the previous ''Smile'' collaboration.

Parks worked with [[Inara George]] on a record released in 2008, ''An Invitation'', and they performed two songs together on January 8, 2008, at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in Los Angeles, as part of the program ''Concrete Frequency: Songs of the City''.

In 2009, Parks performed in ''[[The People Speak (film)|The People Speak]]'', a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian [[Howard Zinn]]'s ''[[A People's History of the United States]]''. Parks performed with Bob Dylan and [[Ry Cooder]] on the documentary broadcast on December 13, 2009, on the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]]. They played "Do Re Mi" and reportedly a couple of other Guthrie songs that were excluded from the final edit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://peopleshistory.us/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114055144/http://www.thepeoplespeak.com/pages/credits/|url-status=dead|title=Bringing History to Life &#124; Voices of a People's History in the US|archive-date=November 14, 2010|website=Peopleshistory.us|access-date=August 13, 2019}}</ref>

In August 2011, Parks was contacted by [[electronic musician]] [[Skrillex]], who requested that he supply orchestral arrangements. His arranging work was released in December 2011 as the [[iTunes]]-exclusive bonus track "Skrillex Orchestral Suite by [[Varien]]" on the ''[[Bangarang (EP)|Bangarang]]'' EP. Parks admitted in 2013: 

{{blockquote|When Skrillex called me up, I'd never heard of him. I pretended I knew who he was.{{nbsp}}... I said, "Well, send me the piece, and if I feel able, I'll do it."

Parks underwent unsuccessful hand surgery in 2014, causing his hands to freeze after about forty minutes of playing piano. On May 9, 2015, Parks performed what he called his "final piano performance" at the [[Largo (nightclub)|Largo]] in Los Angeles. Guest performers included singer [[Gaby Moreno]]; songwriter-producer [[Joe Henry]]; Grizzly Bear's [[Edward Droste]]; New Zealand singer-songwriter [[Kimbra]]; and jazz guitarist-composer [[Grant Geissman]]. Of upcoming projects Parks said: "[It will] set poetry to music, to underscore poems. So I will still be performing once I get that done. I will be looking to find a celebrated string quartet to take things to an irreducible minimum. I can pick up a quartet in Peoria, or in Europe, to perform something like this. I also hope to find a film project that interests me."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Randy|title=Van Dyke Parks gives his 'final performance' on the piano|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-van-dyke-parks-largo-coronet-20150512-story.html|work=[[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=May 12, 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512115551/http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-van-dyke-parks-largo-coronet-20150512-story.html|archive-date=May 12, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref>
