== History ==

=== Early years (2000–2010) ===

Emery formed in 2001 in Rock Hill, South Carolina but moved to Seattle, Washington in search of a better musical environment. The band was named after a first grader that Toby Morrell met while working as an intern for a teacher in college. The four members in the band at the time, Toby Morrell ([[singing|vocals]]/[[guitar]]), Devin Shelton ([[Drum kit|drums]]), Matt Carter ([[guitar]]/[[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]]), and Joel "Chopper" Green ([[Bass guitar|bass]]) left Rock Hill, South Carolina for Seattle on September 11, the day of the terrorist attacks; they found out about the attacks when they stopped at a local diner in South Carolina. Most of the members are from the bands Sachul, Joe 747, Simply Waynes and Oogie Brown.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010|reason=Were all of the band members of these four bands or were individual members also members of these bands? How does it all fit together?}} After a little while Seth Studley, who was one of the original members of the band, broke out of a serious relationship and followed them to Seattle and resumed his post as drummer. Because Seth took over drums, Devin took the position of guitarist.

After making Emerald City their new home in Seattle, Washington, Emery signed a record deal with Tooth & Nail Records, also of Seattle, in 2002.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p626413|pure_url=yes}} Emery signs with Tooth & Nail Records] AllMusic. Retrieved November 30, 2008.</ref> Wasting no time, Emery paired up with [[Record producer|producer]]/[[Audio engineer|engineer]] [[Ed Rose]] and worked on their debut album, ''[[The Weak's End]]''. It was produced at the Black Lodge Studio in Eudora, Kansas.<ref>[http://www.last.fm/music/Emery/+wiki Where Emery recorded their first CD] last.fm. Retrieved December 1, 2008.</ref> The record was released in January 2004 by Tooth & Nail Records. Emery toured extensively to promote their new release.

While touring, Seth Studley decided to leave the band in order to get married and Emery had to look for a new drummer.<ref>[https://archive.today/20070707163322/http://www.korg.com/sbytes/article.asp?ArtistID=312 Reason why Seth Studley Left Emery] Korg.com. Retrieved November 30, 2008.</ref> While touring with [[Haste the Day]], Dave Powell was brought out to audition. Powell was officially put in the band in November 2005. Powell originally played in the Indianapolis-based [[metalcore]]/[[hardcore punk|hardcore]] band The Bowels of Judas.

Soon after touring, Emery went back into the studio to record their next record with production done by [[Aaron Sprinkle]] this time around. The band took five weeks in recording sessions. ''[[The Question (Emery album)|The Question]]'' was released on August 2, 2005. "Studying Politics" was released as the album's first single with a video emerging on June 29, 2005.<ref>{{YouTube|J8cq0rmwRPE|Video for Studying Politics}}.

The DVD included a [[documentary film]] of Emery, live songs and bonus footage.

After the re-release, Joel "Chopper" Green decided to leave the band. On September 19, 2006, Emery posted a blog on their website explaining the departure.<ref>[http://www.emerymusic.com/palebird/news.php Blog Post from Emery and Joel Green] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914033735/http://www.emerymusic.com/palebird/news.php |date=September 14, 2008 }} Emerymusic.com.

While touring with [[Underoath]] in Australia, Emery announced that they were releasing a new album, ''[[I'm Only a Man]]'', which leaked onto the internet before its official release on October 2, 2007. It was produced by Ryan Boesch and Matt Carter and recorded at Dark Horse Recording Studio in [[Tennessee]]. It received mixed reviews. Emery released a deluxe edition of the album as well, which featured four acoustic songs that were recorded while on the [[Take Action Tour]] with [[The Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]] and DVD with live footage and a documentary. The [[iTunes]] version of the deluxe edition also added a bonus track called "Whoa! Man".

Emery announced in an interview on [[TVU Music Television|TVU]] that they finished a new 8-track EP entitled ''[[While Broken Hearts Prevail]]'', which was released on October 28, 2008. They began premiering some of the new material while on tour opening for [[The Almost]], including "Edge of the World. "

In an interview with Toby Morrell, Emery announced that they would be releasing a new album called ''[[...In Shallow Seas We Sail]]''. Up until the announcement of Emery resigning to Tooth & Nail Records, it was unsure if the band would seek a new label, since their contract had expired.<ref>[http://underthegunreview.net/?p=735 Interview With Toby Morrell], Underthegunreview.net. Retrieved December 2, 2008.</ref> They re-signed with Tooth & Nail and soon gave out information on their new release.

On May 29, 2009, Emery put ''...In Shallow Seas We Sail'' in its entirety up on their Myspace. On June 2, 2009, ''...In Shallow Seas We Sail'' was officially released.

== BadChristian & Knuckle Breakers  ==
Toby Morrell, Matt Carter and their friend, pastor and former Emery bassist Joey Svendsen used to run a blog called ''Un-learning'', where they wrote about moral and religious issues. The intent was usually to hold open discussions about sensitive topics, while getting a variety of different viewpoints (Christian, [[Atheism|atheist]], etc.) <ref>{{Cite web |title=Un-Learning |url=http://www.un-learning.org/ |access-date=June 6, 2013 |website=Un-learning.org}}</ref>

In 2013, ''Un-learning'' was rebooted as ''BadChristian''. In addition to being a [[blog]], ''BadChristian'' also serves as a [[podcast]] where the three host discussions with guests such as [[Underoath]], [[Norma Jean (band)|Norma Jean]], [[Thrice]] etc.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Christian Podcasts - Podcast - BadChristian |url=http://badchristian.com/podcasts/ |website=BadChristian}}</ref> ''BadChristian'' also serves as the band's own label titled ''BC Music''.
