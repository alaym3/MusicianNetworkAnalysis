==History==
===''Time to Break  the Spell'' as "Veer" (2004-2007)===
The band was formed in 2004 by founders Crispin Earl, and Eric Schraeder, under the original name of "Veer".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-veer-union-mn0001050420 |title=The Veer Union &#124; Biography, Albums, & Streaming Radio |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref>  The band released one independent album, ''[[Time to Break the Spell]]'', in 2006.  After the album's release, and  touring with bands like [[Hinder]], [[Theory of a Deadman]], [[Seether]] and [[Black Stone Cherry]], the band was able to attract major label interest, and signed a record deal with [[Universal Motown Records]].<ref name="Total Assault">{{cite web|url=http://www.totalassault.com/team.php?team_id=364|title=Total Assault - The Veer Union|publisher=Total Assault|access-date=2009-05-03|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/676IwhfMp?url=http://music.totalassault.com/artists/364/The_Veer_Union/|archive-date=2012-04-21}}</ref> Once signing to the label, the band decided to change their name to "The Veer Union". The band explained that it wasn't legal problems, but rather getting away from negative situations and coming together in a more positive one.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/interview/theveerunionx21x04x09 |title=The Veer Union Interview |website=Contactmusic.com |access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref> <blockquote>"It was more of a band decision. Before TVU we were all in other bands and not digging the situations we were in. So we "veered" away from the negativity and came together as a "Union". Originally it was Veer, when we got signed, we added the Union."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic.net/?page=interview&id=274 |title=Melodic Net - Interview |website=Melodic.net |date=2009-09-22 |access-date=2016-01-05}}</ref> </blockquote>

After the band received major record label attention, the album was re-issued in August 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockaccess.net/release-dates/archived-release-dates-2011/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722112618/http://rockaccess.net/release-dates/archived-release-dates-2011/|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 July 2012|title=Archived Release Dates – 2011 :: Rock Access – Rock News|date=22 July 2012|access-date=4 July 2018}}</ref>

===''Against the Grain'' (2008-2010)===
Before releasing their debut album, they recorded and released a self-titled EP containing alternate versions of songs on their debut, and unreleased songs as well. The band released their debut album, ''[[Against the Grain (The Veer Union album)|Against the Grain]]'', on April 21, 2009. Against the Grain has reached number 32 on Billboard's [[Top Heatseekers]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-05-09/heatseekers-albums |title=Top Heatseekers - Against the Grain |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2009-05-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201013141/http://www.billboard.com/charts/2009-05-09/heatseekers-albums |archive-date=February 1, 2013 }}</ref> and its first single, Seasons, has reached number 10 on Billboard's [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart,<ref>{{cite web|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the veer union|chart=all}}|title=Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks - Seasons|publisher=Billboard|access-date=2009-05-03}}</ref> number 16 on the [[Rock Songs]] chart and number 30 on the [[Alternative Songs]] chart.

Despite the band's success with the album, the single "Seasons", and reports of the band getting along very well with their record label,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.upvenue.com/music-news/blog-headline/1069/interview-with-the-veer-union.html |title=Interview With The Veer Union |website=Upvenue.com |date=2009-04-21 |access-date=2016-01-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160127211738/http://www.upvenue.com/music-news/blog-headline/1069/interview-with-the-veer-union.html |archive-date=2016-01-27 }}</ref> the band was dropped from the label after touring in support of the album ended.

===''Divide the Blackened Sky'' (2011-2012)===
Despite being dropped by Universal Records, the band decided to continue on without major record label support. In 2011, the band announced the title of their second album would be ''[[Divide the Blackened Sky]],'' and would be released on smaller label Rocket Science Ventures/Red Distribution. In 2011, they held a contest to have fans submit artwork to be picked to be on the album's front cover.<ref>{{cite web|date=2011-01-01|title=The Veer Union Title New Album &#124; tunelab™|url=http://tunelab.com/2011/01/01/the-veer-union-title-new-album/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609121008/http://tunelab.com/2011/01/01/the-veer-union-title-new-album/|archive-date=2012-06-09|access-date=2016-01-05|website=Tunelab.com}}</ref> ''Divide the Blackened Sky'' was released on March 26, 2012,<ref name="autogenerated8">{{cite web|date=2012-02-08|title=Quick Hits: Grammy Awards, Ozzy Osbourne, The X Factor, Rock on the Range, Missy Elliott & Timbaland, Paul McCartney & Elton John, Damon Albarn & Flea, Killswitch Engage, Veer Union, Luscious Jackson, Deftones, MTV Video Play Awards, Juno Awards|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2390523|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203044847/http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2390523|archive-date=2013-12-03|access-date=2016-01-05|website=FMQB.com}}</ref> and the first single was "Bitter End".<ref name=autogenerated8 /> Frontman Crispin Earl said of the album, ""Our new record, ''Divide The Blackened Sky'', is a much darker and heavier effort than our previous works. It depicts all the hard times we have been through over the last couple of years."<ref name=autogenerated8 />

On February 22, 2012, it was announced that bassist Marc Roots and guitarist James Fiddler left the band. The band chose to use their previous bass tech, Winston Wolfe, as a touring replacement on bass, and decided to not find a replacement for Fiddler as the second guitarist, opting to continue as a four-piece band. In April 2012, the band toured with [[My Darkest Days]] and [[Cavo]]. In July 2012, the band announced intentions on releasing a fourth studio album, for release some time in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Erickson|first=Anne|date=2012-07-27|title=The Veer Union's Crispin Earl Dishes on Current Music Industry, Love for Def Leppard + More|url=http://loudwire.com/the-veer-union-crispin-earl-talks-new-music-loving-def-leppard-more/|url-status=live|access-date=2016-01-05|website=Loudwire.com}}</ref>
