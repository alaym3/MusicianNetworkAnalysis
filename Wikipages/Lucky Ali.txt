Ali and his father shared a tempestuous relationship. [[Mehmood (actor)|Mehmood Ali]] was a very busy actor in the 1960s and 70s, and remained away from home for his shoots. Once, around the age of four when Ali first returned from boarding school, Mehmood and the entire family had come to receive Ali after 10 months in boarding school, at the airport. Ali did not recognize his father, but on seeing him said, "He's the film comedian Mehmood!" Ali lived away from his family in a boarding school in Dehradun, [[Mussoorie]]. Ali's tryst with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] led Mehmood to write the script of the movie ''[[Dushman Duniya Ka]]'' (Enemy of the World).<ref name="rediff_hitting_high">{{cite web
