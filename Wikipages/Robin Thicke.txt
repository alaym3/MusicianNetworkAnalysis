Thicke was born on March 10, 1977, in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].<ref name=biochannel /> His parents are American actress-singer [[Gloria Loring]], who appeared on the NBC daytime drama ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', and actor [[Alan Thicke]] (1947–2016), who is originally from Canada and known for his role on the TV sitcom ''[[Growing Pains]]''.

Inc.|access-date=28 January 2015}}</ref> Robin Thicke also appeared in [[bit parts|small roles]] on ''[[The Wonder Years]]'', ''[[The New Lassie]]'', ''[[Just the Ten of Us]]'' and several episodes of ''[[Growing Pains]]''.

Thicke's parents were supportive of his musical inclinations; his father helped him to write and structure his first songs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Crossan|first1=Ashley|title=Flashback: A 13-Year-Old Robin Thicke Hopes for a Music Career on the Set of 'Growing Pains'|url=http://www.etonline.com/music/160928_flashback_a_13_year_old_robin_thicke_hopes_for_a_music_career_on_the_set_of_growing_pains/|website=etonline.com|access-date=29 July 2015}}</ref> According to Robin Thicke, his father would not pay for Robin Thicke (then in his early teens) and his vocal group, As One, to record a professionally produced [[demo (music)|demo tape]], wanting Robin to focus on his studies and graduate from school before committing to the pursuit of a career in music.<ref name=PrestigeHK /><ref name=TomJoyner>{{cite episode |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owJEaxsIO2k |title=Robin Thicke In Studio Jam |series=''[[The Tom Joyner Morning Show]]''| network=Reach Media |date=February 1, 2012 |access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name=NYTimes>{{citation |last=McKinley Jr. |first=James C. |title=Robin Thicke, a Romantic, Has a Naughty Hit |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/arts/music/robin-thicke-a-romantic-has-a-naughty-hit.html |work=The New York Times |date=July 19, 2013 |access-date=February 15, 2014}}</ref> The demo ultimately was paid for by jazz vocalist [[Al Jarreau]], an uncle of one of the group members.<ref name=TomJoyner/>
His demo made its way to [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] singer [[Brian McKnight]], who was impressed enough by Thicke to invite him into the studio to work with him.<ref name=NYTimes /> Thicke was signed to McKnight's production company; "Anyway", a song co-written with Thicke, was featured on McKnight's second album ''[[I Remember You (Brian McKnight album)|I Remember You]]''.<ref name=WhiteLikeMe>{{cite web|last1=Mitchell|first1=Gail|title=Robin Thicke: White Like Me|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1044035/robin-thicke-white-like-me|website=Billboard.com|access-date=30 July 2015|date=September 19, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=I Remember You |others=Brian McKnight |year=1995 |type=media notes |publisher=Mercury Records |location=United States}}</ref> Thicke's peers jokingly nicknamed him "Brian McWhite".<ref name=NPR>{{cite news|last1=Mandler|first1=Anthony|title=Robin Thicke: Heart And Soul In 'Love After War'|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/12/11/143394755/robin-thicke-heart-and-soul-in-love-after-war|newspaper=NPR.org|access-date=28 January 2015}}</ref> It was Thicke's association with McKnight, who Thicke counts as one of his first mentors, that led him to his acquaintance with [[Jimmy Iovine]] and helped him to land his first recording contract with [[Interscope Records]] at the age of 16.

Thicke moved out on his own at the age of 17, during his senior year of high school, earning a living and supporting himself as a professional record producer and songwriter.<ref name=Howard /><ref name=bluesandsoul>{{cite interview| title=Robin Thicke: In the Thicke of It |interviewer=Pete Lewis |url=http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/355/zapp_pow_its_robin/ |website=BluesandSoul.com |access-date=February 15, 2014}}</ref> Thicke has noted that while his parents did not attempt to dissuade him from his desire to be in the music industry, their own experience with the nature of the entertainment business made them leery in the beginning.<ref name=PrestigeHK /> As Thicke's list of credits grew so did his parents' confidence in his decision.<ref name=PrestigeHK />

While initially signed as a singer and artist in his own right, Thicke first made a name for himself within the industry as a songwriter and producer for other artists before releasing and performing his own music.<ref>{{cite interview| title=Robin Thicke |interviewer=Rob Schwartz |url=http://www.whomag.net/robin-thicke/ |website=whomag.net |access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref> Among his [[Robin Thicke production discography|work for other artists]], Thicke co-wrote "Love Is on My Side" on [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]]'s [[Brandy (album)|eponymous debut album]];<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Brandy |others=Brandy |year=1994 |type=media notes|publisher=Atlantic Records |location=United States}}</ref> he also wrote for [[3T]]'s ''[[Brotherhood (3T album)|Brotherhood]]'',<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Brotherhood |others=3T |year=1995 |type=media notes |publisher=MJJ Music |location=United States}}</ref> and collaborated with [[Jordan Knight]], [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis]] on several songs in Knight's 1999 album ''[[Jordan Knight (album)|Jordan Knight]]'' including the Billboard top 10 hit "[[Give It to You (Jordan Knight song)|Give It to You]]".<ref>{{cite AV media notes |title=Jordan Knight |others=Jordan Knight |year=1999 |type=media notes|publisher=Interscope Records |location=United States}}</ref> According to Thicke, Knight also invested in the ability of the young songwriter early on by purchasing studio equipment for him.<ref>{{cite interview|last=Thicke |first=Robin| interviewer=Craig Clizbe |title=Robin Thicke|date=April 26, 2006 |url=http://clizbeats.com/robin-thicke/|website=Clizbeats.com|access-date=12 October 2015}}</ref>

He also co-wrote the song "When You Put Your Hands on Me" for [[Christina Aguilera]]'s [[Christina Aguilera (album)|debut album]] and co-wrote and produced three songs for [[Mýa]]'s sophomore release, ''[[Fear of Flying (album)|Fear of Flying]]''. In 1999, Thicke co-wrote the song "[[Fall Again]]" with [[Walter Afanasieff]], which was intended to be a track on [[Michael Jackson|Michael Jackson's]] 2001 album [[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|''Invincible'']], but it failed to be presented as a completed song. The demo Michael recorded in 1999 was released on November 16, 2004, as an album track of his [[limited edition]] [[box set]] ''[[The Ultimate Collection (Michael Jackson album)|The Ultimate Collection]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Jackson – The Ultimate Collection |publisher=discogs.com |access-date=February 9, 2014|url=http://www.discogs.com/Michael-Jackson-The-Ultimate-Collection/release/2008841}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Jackson – The Ultimate Collection, credits|publisher=allmusic.com |access-date=February 9, 2014|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-ultimate-collection-sony-epic-mw0000633468/credits}}</ref> As an artist, he recorded and performed solely under his surname, Thicke. He would continue to do so until 2005.

==Career==

===1999–2003: ''A Beautiful World'' and early success===
At the age of 22, after an involvement with [[Tommy Mottola]] and [[Epic Records]] following the end of his first deal with Interscope, Thicke resolved himself to work chiefly on material for his debut album, initially titled ''Cherry Blue Skies'', planning to use his own money to fund the project.<ref name=NaturalSelection /><ref name=CherryBlueSkies>{{cite magazine|last1=Kipnis|first1=Jill|title=Thicke's "Cherry Blue Skies" Bows Harrell, Edmonds' NuAmerica|magazine=Billboard|date=November 16, 2002|page=17}}</ref> As Thicke told ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', "I decided I was going to save money to make my album, and I hoped to offer it to labels–take it or leave it–so I didn't have to negotiate how to make my music."<ref name=CherryBlueSkies /> While piecing his album together, Thicke began working with veteran producer and label executive [[Andre Harrell]] and, under his guidance, eventually signed with Interscope for a second time as part of Harrell's and [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds']] Nu America [[imprint label]] in 2001.<ref name=NaturalSelection /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dreisinger|first1=Boz|title=Play That Funky Music|journal=Vibe|date=September 2002|volume=10|issue=9}}</ref>

In 2002, Thicke released his debut single "[[When I Get You Alone]]". The track samples [[Walter Murphy]]'s "[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]", which itself is a disco rendition of Beethoven's [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|Fifth Symphony]]. The music video for the song received some rotation on [[MTV2]] and [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]]'s ''Rated Next'' and was spun moderately on pop and urban radio, peaking at number 49 on [[Radio & Records]] Pop chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robin Thicke. R&R CHR/Pop charts|url=http://wweb.uta.edu/faculty/gghunt/charts/thicke.htm|publisher=(c) Radio & Records, Inc.|access-date=11 February 2015}}</ref> Globally, however, "When I Get You Alone" became a chart success when it peaked in the Top 20 in Australia, Belgium, and Italy, and reached the Top 10 of the singles charts in New Zealand and the Top 3 in the Netherlands.<ref name="Dutch Top 40">{{cite web |url=http://www.top40.nl/thicke/thicke-when-i-get-you-alone_12764 |title=Dutch Top 40 Chart Statistics for Thicke – When I Get You Alone |access-date=March 22, 2013 |work=[[Dutch Top 40]]}}</ref>

The moderate success was enough to signal the release of the album in 2003 with its name changed to ''[[A Beautiful World]]''. Despite the release of a second single, "Brand New Jones", the album received very little promotion and debuted at number 152 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart,<ref name="Billboard albums">{{cite web |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=robin thicke|chart=all}} |title=Artist Chart History – Robin Thicke Albums |access-date=September 29, 2006 |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> selling 119,000 copies as of January, 2012.<ref name=NaturalSelection /><ref name="ThickeSoul">{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RsAnJ7Zx_qgC&pg=RA1-PA31 |title=Thicke With Soul |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |volume=124 |issue=1 |page=31 |date=January 2012 |author=Benjamin, Jeff}}</ref> ''A Beautiful World'' fell below the label's commercial expectations.<ref name=WhiteLikeMe /><ref name=NaturalSelection /> The album's under-performance troubled Thicke personally, but it proved enough to make him a wanted collaborator.<ref name=bluesandsoul /> Thicke has cited Mary J. Blige, Usher, and Lil' Wayne, among others, as those who subsequently reached out to him.<ref name=bluesandsoul />
Reflecting on ''A Beautiful World'' in 2013, Usher stated to ''The New York Times'', "I was blown away — I thought [[Beatles]], [[Earth Wind & Fire]], [[Shuggie Otis]], [[Marvin Gaye]] — all in one album. [Robin's] got a soul you can't buy, man."<ref name=NYTimes />

Runner-up [[Blake Lewis]] performed "When I Get You Alone" during the 2007 season of ''[[American Idol]]'' when the Top 3 chose a song to sing. Lewis has often put Robin Thicke in his list of musical influences in interviews and on the ''American Idol'' website. The song was also performed by [[Blaine Anderson]] (played by [[Darren Criss]]) on ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' during the Season 2 episode "Silly Love Songs".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gleethemusic.com/us/episode/silly-love-songs |title=Glee Season 2 Episode 12: Silly Love Songs &#124; The Official Music for Glee Site |publisher=Gleethemusic.com |access-date=2014-03-01}}</ref>

===2004–07: ''The Evolution of Robin Thicke'' and commercial breakthrough===
Following ''A Beautiful World'', Thicke was keen to begin work on his sophomore album but financial and creative disagreements stemming from the performance of his first album led to a several month-long stalemate between Robin and his record label.<ref name=WhiteLikeMe/>
Regarding this time in his career, Thicke said,"The label pretty much lost faith in my ability to sell. It became a question of, 'Where does he fit? Is he not rock or pop enough? Is he not soul enough?'"<ref name=WhiteLikeMe/> [[Pharrell Williams]], having established a distribution deal with Interscope for his record label, [[Star Trak]], expressed to Jimmy Iovine his interest in Thicke, whose talent he thought of highly.<ref name=NaturalSelection /><ref name=MTV1>{{cite web|last1=Goodman|first1=Abbey|title=Pharrell, Thicke Make A Song Guaranteed To Get Girls Naked|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1507050/pharrell-thicke-make-a-song-guaranteed-to-get-girls-naked/|website=MTV.com|publisher=MTV|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref>

Signed to [[Star Trak]] in 2005, Thicke continued work on his second album, ''[[The Evolution of Robin Thicke]]''.<ref name=MTV1/> The first single, "[[Wanna Love U Girl]]", featured producer Williams and charted successfully on urban radio in the United Kingdom. In 2006, a remix version of the song was filmed with rapper [[Busta Rhymes]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Shaheem|title=In Thicke's Corner: Lil Wayne, Busta Rhymes, Pharrell|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1535363/in-thickes-corner-lil-wayne-busta-rhymes-pharrell/|website=MTV.com|access-date=4 August 2015}}</ref> Nearly a year after the single was released, the album was released on October 3, 2006. To promote the album, Thicke toured with [[India.Arie]] and then opened for [[John Legend]] in late 2006.<ref name=WhiteLikeMe/>

The video for his second single, the ballad "[[Lost Without U]]", was released in fall 2006.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=McCaffery|first1=Damien|title=Dressed to Kill|journal=Vibe|date=December 2006|volume=14|issue=12|page=86}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Video Monitor|magazine=Billboard|date=October 21, 2006|volume=118|issue=42|page=109}}</ref> The song began appearing on Billboard R&B charts in November of that year.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=November 11, 2006|volume=118|issue=45|page=93}}</ref> With the assistance of radio airplay, the song became his breakout hit, reaching number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and spending 11 weeks at number one on the Billboard [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]], making him the first white male artist to top that chart since [[George Michael]] did so in 1988 with [[One More Try (George Michael song)|"One More Try"]].<ref name=SexSkips>{{cite magazine|last1=George|first1=Raphael|title=Thicke's 'Sex' Skips to No. 1|magazine=Billboard |publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|date=March 13, 2010|volume=122|issue=11|page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs - 2007 Archive|url=https://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/2007/r-b-hip-hop-songs|website=Billboard.com|access-date=8 August 2015}}</ref><ref name="Billboard singles">{{cite web |title=Artist Chart History – Robin Thicke Singles |work=[[Billboard.com]] |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=robin thicke|chart=all}} |access-date=February 27, 2007}}</ref>

Thicke and his record label Interscope soon considered potential tracks to be released as the album's next and third single. Thicke's preference was the track "[[Can U Believe]]", which peaked at number 16 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs and at number 99 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart.<ref name="Billboard singles"/><ref name="New Single">{{cite web |title=Thicke Penning New Songs As Current Set Sizzles |work=[[Billboard.com]] |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1054275/thicke-penning-new-songs-as-current-set-sizzles |access-date=March 4, 2007}}</ref> On October 2, 2007, the track "[[Got 2 Be Down]]" was released as the album's fourth official single.

As Thicke stated to the [[The Breakfast Club (radio show)|''Breakfast Club'']], "The album is called ''Blurred Lines''. I've realized as I've gotten older that we all think we're living either in a black or white world, or on a straight path, but most of us are living right in between those straight lines.

The singer also stated his attempt into a more poppy sound than his normal environment. "The last year I've been wanting to have more fun. I think I took myself very seriously as an artist and I wanted to be like [[Marvin Gaye]], and [[John Lennon]] and [[Bob Marley]] and these great artists and songwriters that sang about love and sang about relationships," Robin said. "And then the last year, my wife and I just really wanted to have fun again, we wanted to be young again and we wanted to dance again and go out with our friends, so I wanted to make music that reflected that culture also."

== Controversy ==

=== Performance with Miley Cyrus at MTV Video Music Awards 2013 ===
In 2013, Thicke caused an uproar following his performance with [[Miley Cyrus]] during the [[2013 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]]: during the performance, in which the singers had performed the songs "[[Blurred Lines]]" and "[[We Can't Stop]]", Cyrus had twerked in such a way as to mimic a sexual act with her colleague. The performance caused an uproar not only because it was considered vulgar by public opinion, but also because of the age difference between the two artists.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kroll|first=Katy|date=2014-08-22|title=Miley Cyrus and Robin Thicke's VMA Display: One Year Later|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/twerk-it-out-miley-and-robins-vma-performance-one-year-later-65286/|access-date=2021-10-05|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref> The outcry was such that Thicke declared that he did not feel any sexual stimulation during the performance and that he had no idea what the colleague's intentions were before the performance. Conversely, Miley Cyrus stated that the singer had explicitly asked her to be "as naked as possible" during the performance.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2015-08-28|title=Miley: Robin Thicke "Wanted Me as Naked as Possible" for 2013 VMAs|url=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/miley-cyrus-robin-thicke-wanted-me-as-naked-as-possible-for-vmas-2015288/|access-date=2021-10-05|website=Us Weekly|language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Marvin Gaye plagiarism ===
After Blurred Lines' success, the heirs of singer [[Marvin Gaye]] sued Thicke and [[Pharrell Williams]] claiming the song was a plagiarism of Gaye's song "[[Got to Give It Up]]". Jurors awarded the Gayes $7.4 million, but U.S. District Judge John Kronstadt reduced the sum to $5.3 million, while adding royalties.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2018-03-21|title=Marvin Gaye family prevails in 'Blurred Lines' plagiarism case|language=en|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-music-blurredlines-idUSKBN1GX27P|access-date=2021-10-05}}</ref>

=== Accusations of sexual harassment ===
On 3 October 2021, model and actress [[Emily Ratajkowski]] published an excerpt from her memoir ''My Body'' in the British magazine ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', in which she recounts that she was sexually harassed by Thicke during the recording of the music video for his single "Blurred Lines":<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hackett|first=Emily Dugan and Laura|title=Blurred Lines singer Robin Thicke assaulted me on set, says Emily Ratajkowski|language=en|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/blurred-lines-singer-robin-thicke-assaulted-me-on-set-says-emily-ratajkowski-dkgq83cpf|access-date=2021-10-05|issn=0140-0460}}</ref><blockquote>"Suddenly, out of nowhere, I felt the coolness and foreignness of a stranger's hands cupping my bare breasts from behind, [...] I instinctively moved away, looking back at Robin Thicke. He smiled a goofy grin and stumbled backward, his eyes concealed behind his sunglasses. My head turned to the darkness beyond the set. [The director, Diane Martel's] voice cracked as she yelled out to me, 'Are you okay?"</blockquote>The video director  Diane Martel supported Ratajkowski by stating that she yelled at the singer asking for an explanation and immediately shutting down the shoot, getting a 'coy apology from Thicke, as if he knew it was wrong without understanding how it might have felt for Emily.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Emily Ratajkowski Explains Why She Didn't Speak Out for Years After Robin Thicke Allegedly Groped Her|url=https://people.com/music/emily-ratajkowski-reveals-why-she-didnt-protest-after-robin-thicke-allegedly-groped-her/|access-date=2021-10-05|website=PEOPLE.com|language=en}}</ref>
