'''Fast food''' is a type of [[Mass production|mass-produced]] food designed for commercial resale and with a strong priority placed on "speed of service" versus other relevant factors involved in [[food science|culinary science]]. Fast food was created as a commercial strategy to accommodate the larger numbers of busy commuters, travelers and [[hourly wage|wage workers]] who often did not have the time to sit down at a [[public house]] or [[diner]] and wait for their meal. By making the speed of service the priority, this ensured that customers with strictly limited time (a commuter stopping to procure [[dinner]] to bring home to their family, for example, or an hourly laborer on a short [[lunch break]]) were not inconvenienced by waiting for their food to be cooked on-the-spot (as is expected from a traditional "sit down" [[restaurant]]). In 2018, the fast food industry was worth an estimated $570 billion globally.<ref name="FH-2018">{{cite web |title=Fast Food Industry Analysis 2018 – Cost & Trends |url=https://www.franchisehelp.com/industry-reports/fast-food-industry-analysis-2018-cost-trends/ |website=franchisehelp.com |publisher=Franchise Help |access-date=July 16, 2019 |page=1 |date=2018}}</ref>

The fastest form of "fast food" consists of pre-cooked meals kept in readiness for a customer's arrival ([[Boston Market]] [[rotisserie chicken]], [[Little Caesars]] [[pizza]], etc.), with waiting time reduced to mere seconds. Other fast food outlets, primarily the [[hamburger]] outlets ([[McDonald's]], [[Burger King]], etc.) use mass-produced pre-prepared ingredients (bagged buns and condiments, frozen beef patties, vegetables which are prewashed, pre-sliced, or both; etc.) but the [[hamburgers]] and [[french fries]] are always cooked fresh (or at least relatively recently) and assembled "to order" (like at a diner).

Although a wide variety of food can be "cooked fast", "fast food" is a commercial term-limited to food sold in a [[restaurant]] or store with frozen, preheated or precooked ingredients and served to the customer in a packaged form for [[take-out]]/take-away.

[[Fast food restaurants]] are traditionally distinguished by their ability to serve food via a [[drive-through]].  Outlets may be stands or [[kiosk]]s, which may provide no shelter or seating,<ref>{{cite book | title = Fast Food: Roadside Restaurants in the Automobile Age | url = https://archive.org/details/fastfoodroadside0000jakl | url-access = registration | first = John | last = Jakle | publisher = Johns Hopkins University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-8018-6920-4 }}; {{cite book | title = Texts Under Negotiation: The Bible and Postmodern Imagination | url = https://archive.org/details/textsundernegoti0000brue | url-access = registration | first = Walter | last = Brueggemann | publisher = Fortress Press | year = 1993 | isbn = 978-0-8006-2736-2 }}</ref> or fast food restaurants (also known as ''quick service restaurants'').<ref>{{cite web |title=Quick Service Restaurants (QSR) Market Worth USD 577.71 Billion by 2028 at 3.65% CAGR – Report by Market Research Future (MRFR) |url=https://www.globenewswire.com/en/news-release/2021/08/18/2282854/0/en/Quick-Service-Restaurants-QSR-Market-Worth-USD-577-71-Billion-by-2028-at-3-65-CAGR-Report-by-Market-Research-Future-MRFR.html |website=[[GlobeNewswire]] |date=August 18, 2021 |access-date=26 August 2021}}</ref> [[Franchising|Franchise]] operations that are part of [[Chain store|restaurant chains]] have standardized foodstuffs shipped to each restaurant from central locations.<ref>{{cite book | title = Fast Food, Fast Track: Immigrants, Big Business, and the American Dream | first = Jennifer | last = Talwar | publisher = Westview Press | year = 2003 | isbn = 978-0-8133-4155-2 }}</ref>

Fast food began with the first [[fish and chip]] shops in Britain in the 1860s.{{citation needed|date=July 2020|reason=The term "fast food" seems to have been coined in the mid-20th century, using it in an historical context for fish and chips seems an anachronism.}} Drive-through restaurants were first popularized in the 1950s in the United States. The term "fast food" was recognized in a dictionary by [[Merriam–Webster]] in 1951.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The traditional family dinner is increasingly being replaced by the consumption of takeaway fast food. As a result, the time invested on food preparation is getting lower, with an average woman in the United States spending 47 minutes per day preparing food and the average man spending 19 minutes per day in 2013.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Jaworowska|first1=Agnieszka|last2=Blackham|first2=Toni|last3=Davies|first3=Ian G.|last4=Stevenson|first4=Leonard|date=May 1, 2013|title=Nutritional challenges and health implications of takeaway and fast food|journal=Nutrition Reviews|language=en|volume=71|issue=5|pages=310–318|doi=10.1111/nure.12031|issn=0029-6643|pmid=23590707|url=http://researchonline.ljmu.ac.uk/id/eprint/6791/1/O%3A%5CPhase%201%20-%20Manuscripts%5CAccepted%20-%20Nutrition%20Reviews%20%28The%20nutritional%20challenge%20and%20health%20implications%20of%20takeaway%20and%20fast%20food%29%5CSUBMITTED%20-%20The%20nutritional%20challenge%20and%20health%20%20%20Revised%20V1%200%2027%2001%2012%20%28submitted%20version%29.pdf}}</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Chinese noodles.JPG|thumb|Pulling wheat dough into thin strands to form ''[[lamian]]'']]
{{See also|Fast food restaurant#History}}
The concept of ready-cooked food for sale is closely connected with urban developments. Homes in emerging cities often lacked adequate space or proper food preparation accoutrements. Additionally, procuring cooking fuel could cost as much as purchased produce. Frying foods in vats of searing oil proved as dangerous as it was expensive. Homeowners feared that a rogue cooking fire "might easily conflagrate an entire neighborhood".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Laudan|first=Rachel|year=2001|title=A Plea for Culinary Modernism: Why We Should Love New, Fast, Processed Food|journal=Gastronomica: The Journal of Critical Food Studies|volume=1|pages=36–44|doi=10.1525/gfc.2001.1.1.36}}</ref> Thus, urbanites were encouraged to purchase pre-prepared meats or starches, such as bread or noodles, whenever possible. In [[Ancient Rome]], cities had street stands – a large counter with a receptacle in the middle from which food or drink would have been served.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ancient Romans preferred fast food|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2007/06/20/1956392.htm|website=ABC Science|access-date=June 30, 2016|date=June 19, 2007}}</ref> It was during post-WWII American economic boom that Americans began to spend more and buy more as the economy boomed and a culture of consumerism bloomed. As a result of this new desire to have it all, coupled with the strides made by women while the men were away, both members of the household began to work outside the home. Eating out, which had previously been considered a luxury, became a common occurrence, and then a necessity. Workers, and working families, needed quick service and inexpensive food for both lunch and dinner.

=== Pre-industrial Old World ===
In the cities of Roman antiquity, much of the urban population living in ''[[insulae]]'', multi-story apartment blocks, depended on food vendors for much of their meal; the Forum itself served as a marketplace where Romans could purchase baked goods and cured meats.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Daily Life in Ancient Rome|last=Dupont|first=Florence|publisher=Blackwell|year=1992|location=Oxford|pages=181}}</ref> In the mornings, bread soaked in wine was eaten as a quick snack and cooked vegetables and stews later in ''[[popina]]'', a simple type of eating establishment.<ref>{{cite book | title=The Ancient Roman City | publisher=JHU Press | author=Stambaugh, John E. | year=1988 | pages=200, 209 | isbn=978-0-8018-3692-3}}</ref> In Asia, 12th century Chinese ate fried dough, soups and stuffed buns, all of which still exist as contemporary snack food.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Food in Chinese Culture: Anthropological and Historical Perspectives|last=Chang|first=Kwang-chih|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1977|location=New Haven}}</ref> Their Baghdadi contemporaries supplemented home-cooked meals with processed legumes, purchased starches, and even ready-to-eat meats.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Baghdad during the Abbasid Caliphate from Contemporary Arabic and Persian Sources, 81–82|last=Le Strange|first=G.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1924|location=London|pages=81–82}}</ref> During the [[Middle Ages]], large towns and major urban areas such as [[London]] and [[Paris]] supported numerous vendors that sold dishes such as [[pie]]s, [[pasty|pasties]], [[Custard tart|flans]], [[waffle]]s, [[wafer]]s, [[pancake]]s and cooked meats. As in Roman cities during antiquity, many of these establishments catered to those who did not have means to cook their own food, particularly single households. Unlike richer town dwellers, many often could not afford housing with kitchen facilities and thus relied on fast food. Travelers such as [[pilgrim]]s en route to a [[Shrine|holy site]], were among the customers.<ref>{{cite book | title=Food and Eating in Medieval Europe | publisher=Bloomsbury Academic | author=Carling, Martha | year=2003 | pages=27–51 | isbn=978-1-85285-148-4}}</ref>

British fast food had considerable regional variation. Sometimes the regionality of a dish became part of the culture of its respective area, such as the [[Cornish pasty]] and [[deep-fried Mars bar]]. The content of fast food pies has varied, with [[poultry]] (such as [[chicken]]s) or [[Anatidae|wildfowl]] commonly being used. Since the [[World War II|Second World War]], [[Turkey as food|turkey]] has been used more frequently in fast food.<ref name="turkeyuk">{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6331007.stm|title=How turkey became a fast food|access-date=November 23, 2007|publisher=BBC|author=BBC News | date=February 7, 2007}}</ref> The UK has adopted fast food from other cultures as well, such as [[pizza]], [[doner kebab]], and [[curry]].

As [[automobile]]s became popular and more affordable following [[World War I]], [[Drive-through|drive-in restaurants]] were introduced. The American company [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]], founded by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]], [[Kansas]] in 1921, is generally credited with opening the second fast food outlet and first [[hamburger]] chain, selling hamburgers for five cents each.<ref name="npr">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/hamburger/|title=The Hamburger|access-date=November 23, 2007|publisher=[[National Public Radio|NPR]]|year=2002|author=National Public Radio|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222171713/http://www.npr.org/programs/morning/features/patc/hamburger/|archive-date=December 22, 2007|url-status=dead|author-link=National Public Radio}}</ref> Walter Anderson had built the first White Castle restaurant in Wichita in 1916, introducing the limited [[menu]], high-volume, low-cost, high-speed hamburger restaurant.<ref name="jpfarrell">{{Cite web|url=http://jpfarrell.blogspot.com/2007/11/evolution-of-quick-service-restaurant.html|title=The Evolution of the Quick Service Restaurant|access-date=February 14, 2008|publisher=A Management Consultant @ Large|author=James P Farrell}}</ref> Among its innovations, the company allowed customers to see the food being prepared. [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] was successful from its inception and spawned numerous competitors.

Franchising was introduced in 1921 by [[A&W Root Beer]], which franchised its distinctive syrup. [[Howard Johnson's]] first franchised the restaurant concept in the mid-1930s, formally standardizing menus, [[signage]] and advertising.<ref name="jpfarrell" />

Curb service was introduced in the late 1920s and was mobilized in the 1940s when [[carhop]]s strapped on [[roller skates]].<ref name="Honk for Service">{{cite book | title=Honk for Service, a Man, a Tray, and the Glory Days of the Drive-in | publisher=Tray Days Publishing | author=Mcginley, Lou Ellen | year=2004 | isbn=978-0-615-12697-5}}</ref>

The United States has the largest fast [[food industry]] in the world, and American fast food restaurants are located in over 100 countries. Approximately 5.4&nbsp;million U.S. workers are employed in the areas of food preparation and food servicing, including fast food in the USA as of 2018.<ref name="bls.gov">{{cite web | url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/food-preparation-and-serving/food-and-beverage-serving-and-related-workers.htm | title=BLS.gov: Food and Beverage Serving and Related Workers | date=December 17, 2015 | access-date=April 6, 2016}}</ref> Worries of an obesity epidemic and its related illnesses have inspired many local government officials in the United States to propose to limit or regulate fast-food restaurants.

In [[Los Angeles County]], for example, about 45% of the restaurants in [[South Central Los Angeles]] are fast-food chains or restaurants with minimal seating.

==== Working conditions ====
The National Employment Law Project wrote in 2013, "according to a study by researchers at the [[University of California-Berkeley]], more than half (52 percent) of front-line fast-food workers must rely on at least one public assistance program to support their families. As a result, the fast-food-industry business model of low wages, non-existent benefits, and limited work hours costs taxpayers an average of nearly $7 billion every year". They claim this funding allows these workers to "afford health care, food, and other basic necessities".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nelp.org/content/uploads/2015/03/NELP-Super-Sizing-Public-Costs-Fast-Food-Report.pdf | title=Super-Sizing public costs: How Low Wages at Top Fast-Food Chains Leave Taxpayers Footing the Bill | publisher=National Employment Law Project | date=October 2013 | access-date=May 22, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505194926/http://nelp.org/content/uploads/2015/03/NELP-Super-Sizing-Public-Costs-Fast-Food-Report.pdf | archive-date=May 5, 2015 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://laborcenter.berkeley.edu/publiccosts/fast_food_poverty_wages.pdf | title=Fast Food, Poverty Wages: The Public Cost of Low-wage jobs in the Fast Food Industry | publisher=University of California Labor Center | date=October 15, 2013 | author=Maclay, Kathleen}}</ref>

Fast food outlets are ''take-away'' or ''take-out'' providers that promise quick service. Such fast food outlets often come with a "drive-through" service that lets customers order and pick up food from their vehicles. Others have indoor or outdoor seating areas where customers can eat on-site. The boom in IT services has allowed customers to order food from their homes through their smartphone apps in recent times.

Nearly from its inception, fast food has been designed to be eaten "on the go," often does not require traditional [[cutlery]], and is eaten as a [[finger food]]. Common menu items at fast food outlets include [[fish and chips]], [[sandwich]]es, [[pita]]s, [[hamburger]]s, [[fried chicken]], [[french fries]], [[onion rings]], [[chicken nuggets]], [[taco]]s, [[pizza]], [[hot dog]]s, and [[ice cream]], though many fast food restaurants offer "slower" foods like [[chili con carne|chili]], [[mashed potatoes]], and [[salad]]s.

=== Filling stations ===
[[Convenience store]]s located within many [[filling station|petrol/gas stations]] sell pre-packaged sandwiches, [[doughnut]]s, and hot food. Many gas stations in the United States and Europe also sell [[frozen food]]s, and have [[microwave oven]]s on the premises in which to prepare them. Petrol Stations in Australia sell foods such as [[pie|hot pie]]s, sandwiches, and [[chocolate bar]]s, which are easy for a customer to access while on their journey. Petrol stations are a place that are often open long hours and are open before and after shop trading hours, therefore, it makes it easy to access for consumers.

=== Street vendors and concessions ===
{{Main|Street food}}

[[File:Pajdas, Sobota.JPG|thumb|Fastfood restaurant in [[Eastern Europe]]: The ''Pajdaš'' (in [[Prekmurje dialect]] ''Buddy''), [[Murska Sobota]] [[Slovenia]].]]
Traditional street food is available around the world, usually through small and independent [[Hawker (trade)|vendors]] operating from a cart, table, portable grill or motor vehicle. Common examples include [[Vietnam]]ese rice soup vendors, Middle Eastern falafel stands, New York City [[hot dog cart]]s, and [[Food truck|taco trucks]]. Turo-Turo vendors ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for point point) are a feature of [[Philippines|Philippine]] life. Commonly, street vendors provide a colorful and varying range of options designed to captivate passers-by and attract as much attention as possible quickly.

Multiple street vendors may specialize in specific types of food; typically, they are characteristic of a given cultural or ethnic tradition depending on the locale. In some cultures, it is typical for street vendors to call out prices, sing or chant sales-pitches, play music, or engage in other forms of "[[Street theatre|street theatrics]]" to engage prospective customers. In some cases, this can garner more attention than the food.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== Cuisine ==
[[File:Fast food vendors in Ilorin Nigeria6.jpg|thumb|Fastfood in [[Ilorin, Kwara]]]]
Modern commercial fast food is often highly processed and prepared in an industrial fashion, i.e., on a large scale with standard ingredients and standardized cooking and production methods.<ref name=ultraprocessed>{{cite journal|last1=Monteiro|first1=C.A.|last2=Moubarac|first2=J.-C.|last3=Cannon|first3=G.|last4=Ng|first4=S.W.|last5=Popkin|first5=B.|title=Ultra-processed products are becoming dominant in the global food system|journal=Obesity Reviews |year=2013|volume=14 Suppl 2|pages=21–8|doi=10.1111/obr.12107|pmid=24102801|s2cid=13735684}}</ref> It is usually rapidly served in cartons or bags or in plastic wrapping, in a fashion that minimizes cost. In most fast food operations, menu items are generally made from [[Food processing|processed ingredients]] prepared at a central supply facility and then shipped to individual outlets where they are reheated, cooked (usually by microwave or [[deep frying]]) or assembled in a short amount of time. This process ensures a consistent level of product quality. It is key to being able to deliver the order quickly to the customer and eliminate labor and equipment costs in the individual stores.

Because of commercial emphasis on quickness, uniformity and low cost, fast food products are often made with ingredients formulated to achieve a certain flavor or consistency and to preserve freshness.

=== Variants ===
[[File:2007feb-sushi-odaiba-manytypes.jpg|thumb|Many types of sushi ready to eat]]
Chinese takeaways/takeout restaurants are particularly popular in Western countries such as the US and UK. They normally offer a wide variety of [[Asian cuisine|Asian food]] (not always Chinese), which has normally been fried. Most options are some form of noodles, [[rice]], or [[meat]]. In some cases, the food is presented as a [[smörgåsbord]], sometimes [[self service]]. The customer chooses the size of the container they wish to buy, and then is free to fill it with their choice of food. It is common to combine several options in one container, and some outlets charge by weight rather than by item. In large cities, these restaurants may offer free delivery for purchases over a minimum amount.

[[Sushi]] has seen rapidly rising popularity recently in the Western world. A form of fast food created in Japan (where [[bentō]] is the Japanese variety of fast food), sushi is normally cold sticky rice flavored with a sweet [[rice vinegar]] and served with some topping (often [[Fish (food)|fish]]), or, as in the most popular kind in the West, rolled in [[nori]] (dried [[laver (seaweed)|laver]]) with filling. The filling often includes fish, seafood, chicken or [[cucumber]].

[[Kebab shop|Kebab houses]] are a form of fast food restaurant from the Middle East, especially [[Turkey]] and [[Lebanon]]. Meat is shaven from a [[rotisserie]], and is served on a warmed flatbread with salad and a choice of sauce and dressing. These [[doner kebab]]s or [[shawarma]]s are distinct from [[shish kebab]]s served on sticks. Kebab shops are also found throughout the world, especially [[Europe]], New Zealand and Australia but they generally are less common in the US.

Fish and chip shops are a form of fast food popular in the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. Fish is battered and then deep fried, and served with deep-fried potato strips.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.federationoffishfriers.co.uk/pages/history--599.htm|title=Federation of Fish Friers – Serving the Fish and Chips Industry – History|access-date=May 24, 2015}}</ref>

The [[Netherlands|Dutch]] have their own types of fast food. A Dutch fast food meal often consists of a portion of [[french fries]] (called friet or patat) with a sauce and a meat product. The most common sauce to accompany french fries is [[fritessaus]]. It is a sweet, vinegary and low fat [[mayonnaise]] substitute, that the Dutch nevertheless still call "mayonnaise". When ordering it is very often abbreviated to ''met'' (literally "with"). Other popular sauces are [[ketchup]] or spiced ketchup ("curry"), Indonesian style [[peanut sauce]] ("satésaus" or "pindasaus") or [[piccalilli]]. Sometimes the fries are served with combinations of sauces, most famously ''speciaal'' (special): mayonnaise, with (spiced) ketchup and chopped [[onion]]s; and ''oorlog'' (literally "war"): mayonnaise and peanut sauce (sometimes also with ketchup and chopped onions). The meat product is usually a deep fried snack; this includes the [[frikandel]] (a deep fried skinless [[Ground meat|minced meat]] [[sausage]]), and the [[Croquette|kroket]] (deep fried meat [[ragout]] covered in [[breadcrumb]]s).

In Portugal, there are some varieties of local fast-food and restaurants specialized in this type of local cuisine. Some of the most popular foods include ''frango assado'' ([[Piri-piri]] grilled chicken previously marinated), [[francesinha]], [[francesinha poveira]], [[espetada]] (turkey or pork meat on two sticks) and [[bifana]]s (pork cutlets in a specific sauce served as a sandwich). This type of food is also often served with french fries (called ''batatas fritas''), some international chains started appearing specialized in some of the typical Portuguese fast food such as [[Nando's]].

An example of a local form of fast food in Poland is ''[[pasztecik szczeciński]]'', a deep-fried yeast dough stuffed with meat or vegetarian filling, typical fast food dish of the city of [[Szczecin]] well known in many other cities in the country. A dish is on Polish ''List of traditional products''. The first bar serving ''pasztecik szczeciński'', Bar "Pasztecik" founded in 1969, is located on Wojska Polskiego Avenue 46 in Szczecin.

A fixture of [[East Asia]]n cities is the [[noodle]] shop. [[Flatbread]] and [[falafel]] are today ubiquitous in the [[Middle East]]. Popular Indian fast food dishes include [[vada pav]], [[panipuri]] and [[dahi vada]]. In the French-speaking nations of [[West Africa]], [[Street food|roadside stands]] in and around the larger cities continue to sell—as they have done for generations—a range of ready-to-eat, char-grilled meat sticks known locally as ''[[brochette]]s'' (not to be confused with the bread [[Snack food|snack]] of the same name found in [[Europe]])

One example of [[McDonald's]] expansion on a global scale was its introduction to the Russian market. In order for the American business to succeed it would have to be accepted and integrated into the daily lives of natives in [[Moscow]]. Thus, the restaurant was strategically implemented so that its offerings would align with the distinct and established eating habits, also known as the customs around food, eating and cooking, of Muscovites. One significant characteristic of Russian food culture is the emphasis on knowing about the locality of goods that are consumed. Essentially, in order to successfully launch this American brand in a foreign country, McDonald's interpreted the local interests of consumers in Moscow by promoting the origins of the produce used in the restaurant.<ref>Caldwell, Melissa L.
