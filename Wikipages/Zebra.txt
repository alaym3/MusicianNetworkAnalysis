'''Zebras''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˈ|z|ɛ|b|r|ə|z}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|z|iː|b|r|ə|z}}) (subgenus '''''Hippotigris''''') are African [[equines]] with distinctive black-and-white striped [[Animal coat|coat]]s. There are three [[Extant taxon|living]] species: the [[Grévy's zebra]] (''Equus grevyi''), [[plains zebra]] (''E. quagga''), and the [[mountain zebra]] (''E. zebra''). Zebras share the genus ''Equus'' with [[Wild horse|horses]] and [[Asinus|asses]], the three groups being the only living members of the family [[Equidae]]. Zebra stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual. Several theories have been proposed for the function of these stripes, with most evidence supporting them as a deterrent for biting flies. Zebras inhabit [[East Africa|eastern]] and [[southern Africa]] and can be found in a variety of habitats such as [[savannahs]], [[grasslands]], woodlands, [[shrubland]]s, and mountainous areas.

Zebras are primarily [[grazing (behaviour)|grazers]] and can subsist on lower-quality vegetation. They are preyed on mainly by [[lions]] and typically flee when threatened but also bite and kick. Zebra species differ in [[Sociality|social behaviour]], with plains and mountain zebra living in stable [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] consisting of an adult male or [[stallion]], several adult females or [[mares]], and their young or [[foals]]; while Grévy's zebra live alone or in loosely associated herds. In harem-holding species, adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while male Grévy's zebras establish [[Territory (animal)|territories]] which attract females and the species is [[Promiscuity|promiscuous]]. Zebras communicate with various vocalisations, body postures and facial expressions. [[Social grooming]] strengthens social bonds in plains and mountain zebras.

Zebras' dazzling stripes make them among the most recognisable mammals. They have been featured in art and stories in Africa and beyond. Historically, they have been highly sought after by exotic animal collectors, but unlike [[horses]] and [[donkeys]], zebras have never been truly [[domesticated]]. The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) lists the Grévy's zebra as [[Endangered species|endangered]], the mountain zebra as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and the plains zebra as [[Near-threatened species|near-threatened]]. The [[quagga]], a type of plains zebra, was driven to extinction in the 19th century. Nevertheless, zebras can be found in numerous protected areas.

==Etymology==
The English name "zebra" dates back to {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1600, deriving from [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] or [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref name="etymology">{{cite web |title=Zebra |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |access-date=22 June 2020 |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/zebra}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Zebra |website=[[Lexico]] |access-date=25 June 2020 |url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/zebra}}</ref> Its origins may lie in the [[Latin]] ''equiferus'' meaning "wild horse"; from ''equus'' ("horse") and ''ferus'' ("wild, untamed"). ''Equiferus'' appears to have entered into Portuguese as ''ezebro'' or ''zebro'', which was originally a name for a mysterious (possibly feral) equine in the wilds of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] during the Middle Ages.<ref name="zebro">{{Cite journal |doi=10.5252/az2015n1a2 |title=The Iberian Zebro: what kind of a beast Was It? |journal=Anthropozoologica |volume=50 |year=2015 |last1=Nores |first1=Carlos |last2=Muñiz |first2=Arturo Morales |last3=Rodríguez |first3=Laura Llorente |last4=Bennett |first4=E.

==Taxonomy and evolution==
{{Further|Evolution of the horse}}
Zebras are classified in the genus ''[[Equus (genus)|Equus]]'' (known as equines) along with [[wild horse|horses]] and [[Asinus|asses]]. These three groups are the only living members of the family [[Equidae]].<ref name="MacDonald" /> The [[plains zebra]] and [[mountain zebra]] were traditionally placed in the [[subgenus]] ''Hippotigris'' (C.

As with all wild equines, zebra have barrel-chested bodies with tufted tails, elongated faces and long necks with long, erect [[Mane (horse)|manes]]. Their elongated, slender legs end in a single spade-shaped toe covered in a hard [[horse hoof|hoof]]. Their [[horse teeth|dentition]] is adapted for [[grazing (behaviour)|grazing]]; they have large incisors that clip grass blades and highly crowned, ridged molars well suited for grinding. Males have spade-shaped canines, which can be used as weapons in fighting. The eyes of zebras are at the sides and far up the head, which allows them to see above the tall grass while grazing. Their moderately long, erect ears are movable and can locate the source of a sound.<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Estes 1991">{{Cite book |title=The Behavior Guide to African Mammals |author=Estes|first= R. |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |pages=235–248 |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-520-08085-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g977LsZHpcsC}}</ref><ref name="handbook">{{Cite book |last=Rubenstein|first= D.

Zebras are easily recognised by their bold black-and-white striping patterns. The belly and legs are white when unstriped, but the muzzle is dark and the skin underneath the [[Animal coat|coat]] is uniformly black.<ref name="Bard1977" /><ref>{{cite web |author=Langley|first=  Liz |date=4 March 2017 |title=Do Zebras Have Stripes On Their Skin? |publisher=National Geographic |access-date=2 June 2020 |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2017/03/animals-skin-colors-zebras-big-cats/}}</ref>{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=14–15}} Young or [[foal]]s are born with brown and white coats, and the brown darkens with age.<ref name="Grub 1981" /><ref name="Churcher 1993" /> The general pattern is a dorsal line that extends from the forehead to the tail. From there, the stripes stretch downward except on the rump, where they develop species-specific patterns, and near the nose where they curve toward the nostrils. Stripes split above the front legs, creating shoulder stripes. The stripes on the legs, ears and tail are separate and horizontal. Zebras also have complex patterns around the eyes and the lower jaw.<ref name="Bard1977" />

Striping patterns are unique to an individual and heritable.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=7, 19}} During [[embryonic development]], the stripes appear at eight months, but the patterns may be determined at three to five weeks. For each species there is a point in embryonic development where the stripes are perpendicular to the dorsal and spaced {{convert|0.4|mm|in|abbr=on}} apart. However, this happens at three weeks of development for the plains zebra, four weeks for the mountain zebra, and five for Grévy's zebra. The difference in timing is thought to be responsible for the differences in the striping patterns of the different species.<ref name="Bard1977">{{cite journal |author=Bard|first=  J. |year=1977 |title=A unity underlying the different zebra patterns |journal=[[Journal of Zoology]] |volume=183 |issue=4 |pages=527–539 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1977.tb04204.x}}</ref>

====Function====
The function of stripes in zebras has been discussed among biologists since at least the 19th century.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=1}} Popular hypotheses include the following:
* The '''[[crypsis]] hypothesis''' was proposed by [[Alfred Wallace]] in 1896 and suggests that the stripes allow the animal to blend in with its environment or [[disruptive coloration|break out its outline]] so predators can not perceive it as a single entity.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=2–3, 23, 38}} Zebra stripes may provide particularly good camouflage at nighttime, which is when [[lions]] and [[hyenas]] are actively hunting.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=44–45}} In 1871, [[Charles Darwin]] remarked that "the zebra is conspicuously striped, and stripes on the open plains of South Africa cannot afford any protection".{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=3}} Zebras graze in open habitat and do not behave cryptically, being noisy, fast, and social. They do not freeze when detecting a predator. In addition, lions and hyenas do not appear to be able to discern stripes beyond a certain distance in daylight, thus making the stripes useless in disrupting the outline. Stripes also do not appear to make zebras more difficult to find than uniformly coloured animals of similar size, and predators may still be able to detect them by scent or hearing.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=46–48}} The camouflaging stripes of woodland living ungulates like [[bongo (antelope)|bongos]] and [[Cape bushbuck|bushbucks]] are much less vivid and lack the sharp contrast with the background colour.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=50}}<ref name="Caro" /> In addition, unlike [[tiger]] stripes, the spatial frequencies of zebra stripes do not line up with their environment.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Godfrey|first=  D. |last2=Lythgoe|first2=  J. N. |last3=Rumball|first3=  D. A. |year=1987 |title=Zebra stripes and tiger stripes: the spatial frequency distribution of the pattern compared to that of the background is significant in display and crypsis |journal=[[Biological Journal of the Linnean Society]] |volume=32 |issue=4 |pages=427–433 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1987.tb00442.x}}</ref> A 2014 study could not find any correlations between striping patterns and woodland habitats.<ref name="Caro" />
[[File:Mountain zebra stripes.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Closeup shot of mountain zebra stripes |Closeup of mountain zebra stripes]]
* The '''confusion hypothesis''' states that the stripes confuse predators, be it by: making it harder to distinguish individuals in a group as well as determining the number of zebras in a group; making it difficult to determine an individual's outline when the group flees; reducing a predator's ability to follow a target during a chase; [[dazzle camouflage|dazzling]] an assailant so they have difficulty making contact; or making it difficult for a predator to judge the zebra's size, speed and trajectory via [[motion dazzle]]. This theory has been proposed by several biologists since at least the 1970s.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=72–81, 86}} A 2014 computer study of zebra stripes found that the motion signals made by zebra stripes give out misleading information and can cause confusion via the [[wagon-wheel effect]] or [[barber pole illusion]]. The researchers concluded that this could be used against mammalian predators or biting flies.<ref name="How2014">{{cite journal |author=How|first=  M. J. |last2=Zanker|first2=  J. M. |year=2014 |title=Motion camouflage induced by zebra stripes |journal=Zoology |volume=117 |issue=3 |pages=163–170 |doi=10.1016/j.zool.2013.10.004|pmid= 24368147 }}</ref> The use of the stripes for confusing against mammalian predators has been questioned. The stripes of zebras could make group size look smaller, and thus more attractive to predators. Zebras also tend to scatter when fleeing from attackers and thus the stripes could not obscure an individual's outline. Lions, in particular, appear to have no difficulty targeting and making contact with zebras when they get close and take them by ambush.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=80, 92}} In addition, no correlations have been found between the amount of stripes and populations of mammal predators.<ref name="Caro" />
* The '''[[Aposematism|aposematic]] hypothesis''' suggests that the stripes serve as warning colouration as they are recognisable up close. Biologist L. H. Matthews proposed in 1971 that the stripes on the side of the mouth signal to the animal's bite. As with known aposematic mammals, zebras have high predation pressures and make no attempt to hide.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=55, 57–58}} However they are frequently preyed on by lions, suggesting that stripes do not deter them but may work on smaller predators. In addition, zebras are not slow and sluggish like known aposematic mammals.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=68}}
* The '''social function hypothesis''' states that stripes serve a role in intraspecific or individual recognition, social bonding, mutual grooming facilitation, or a signal of fitness. Darwin wrote in 1871 that "a female zebra would not admit the addresses of a male ass until he was painted so as to resemble a zebra" while Wallace stated in 1871 that: "The stripes therefore may be of use by enabling stragglers to distinguish their fellows at a distance".{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=6, 139–148}} Regarding species and individual identification, zebras have limited range overlap with each other and horses can recognise each other using visual cues.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=150}}  In addition, no correlation has been found between striping and social behaviour among equines.<ref name="Caro" /> There is also no link found between [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] and striping.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=150}}

* The '''[[thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] hypothesis''' suggests that stripes help to control a zebra's body temperature. In 1971, biologist H. A. Baldwin noted that black stripes absorbed heat while the white ones reflected it. In 1990, zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] proposed that the stripes set up [[convection current]]s to cool the animal.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=24}} A study from 2015 determined that environmental temperature is a strong predictor for zebra striping patterns.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Larison |first1=Brenda |last2=Harrigan |first2=Ryan J. |last3=Thomassen |first3=Henri A. |last4=Rubenstein |first4=Daniel I. |last5=Chan-Golston |first5=Alec M. |last6=Li |first6=Elizabeth |last7=Smith |first7=Thomas B. |year=2015 |title=How the zebra got its stripes: a problem with too many solutions |url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/2/1/140452tempa |journal=[[Royal Society Open Science]] |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=140452 |doi=10.1098/rsos.140452 |pmid=26064590 |pmc=4448797|bibcode=2015RSOS....240452L }}</ref> Another study from 2019 also concluded that the stripes played a role in regulating heat. Air currents move faster over the heat-absorbing black hairs than the white ones. At the junction of the stripes, the [[Vortex|air swirls]] and cools down the animal. In addition, zebras appear to be able to raise the hair of the black stripes while keeping white hair flat. During the hottest times of the day, the raised hair may help transfer heat from the skin to the hair surface, while during the cooler early morning, the raised black hair can trap air to prevent heat loss.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Cobb|first=  A. |last2=Cobb|first2=  S. |year=2019 |title=Do zebra stripes influence thermoregulation? |journal=[[Journal of Natural History]] |volume=53 |issue=13–14 |pages=863–879 |doi=10.1080/00222933.2019.1607600|s2cid= 196657566 }}</ref> Others have found no evidence that zebras have cooler bodies than other ungulates whose habitat they share, or that striping correlates with temperature.{{sfn|Caro|2016|pp=158–161}}<ref name="Caro" /> A 2018 experimental study which dressed water-filled metal barrels in horse, zebra and cattle hides found that zebra stripes have no effect on thermoregulation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Horváth |first1=Gábor |last2=Pereszlényi |first2=Ádám |last3=Száz |first3= Dénes|last4=Barta |first4= András |last5= Jánosi |first5= Imre M. |last6=Gerics |first6= Balázs |last7=Åkesson |first7=Susanne|year=2018|title=Experimental evidence that stripes do not cool zebras|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=8|issue=1|page=9351|doi=10.1038/s41598-018-27637-1|pmid=29921931 |pmc=6008466 |bibcode=2018NatSR...8.9351H |doi-access=free }}</ref>
* The '''fly protection hypothesis''' holds that the stripes deter biting flies. [[Horse fly|Horse flies]], in particular, spread diseases that are lethal to equines such as [[African horse sickness]], [[equine influenza]], [[equine infectious anemia]] and [[trypanosomiasis]]. In addition, zebra hair is shorter or the same length as the mouthparts of horse flies.<ref name="Caro" /> Caro and colleagues (2019) reported this hypothesis as the "emerging consensus among biologists".<ref name="Caro2" /> It was found that flies were less likely to land on black-and-white striped surfaces than uniformly coloured ones in 1930 by biologist R. Harris.{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=5}} A 2012 study concurred this and concluded that the stripes reflect contrasting light patterns rather than the uniform patterns these insects use to locate food and water.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Egri |first1=Ádám |last2=Blahó |first2=Miklós |last3=Kriska |first3=György |last4=Farkas |first4=Róbert |last5=Gyurkovszky |first5=Mónika |last6=Åkesson |first6=Susanne |last7=Horváth |first7=Gábor |year=2012 |title=Polarotactic tabanids find striped patterns with brightness and/or polarization modulation least attractive: an advantage of zebra stripes |journal=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]] |volume=215 |issue=5 |pages=736–745 |doi=10.1242/jeb.065540 |pmid=22323196 |doi-access=free}}</ref> A 2014 study found a correlation between the amount of striping and the presence of horse and [[tsetse fly|tsetse flies]].

===Social structure===
{{See also|Horse behaviour}}
[[File:Zebra Botswana edit02.jpg|thumb|A plains zebra group |alt=A group of six plains zebra]]
Zebra species have two basic social structures. Plains and mountain zebras live in stable, closed family groups or [[Harem (zoology)|harems]] consisting of one [[stallion]], several [[mares]], and their offspring. These groups have their own [[home ranges]], which overlap, and they tend to be nomadic. Stallions form and expand their harems by recruiting young mares from their natal (birth) harems. The stability of the group remains even when the family stallion dies or is displaced. Plains zebra groups also live in a [[fission–fusion society]]. They gather into large herds and may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this behaviour has otherwise only been observed in primates such as the [[gelada]] and the [[hamadryas baboon]].<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Estes 1991" /><ref name="Rubenstein 1986" />

Females of these species benefit as males give them more time for feeding, protection for their young, and protection from predators and harassment by outside males. Among females in a harem, a linear [[Dominance (ethology)|dominance hierarchy]] exists based on the time at which they join the group. Harems travel in a consistent filing order with the high-ranking mares and their offspring leading the groups followed by the next-highest ranking mare and her offspring, and so on. The family stallion takes up the rear. Young of both sexes leave their natal groups as they mature; females are usually herded by outside males to be included as permanent members of their harems.<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Estes 1991" /><ref name="Rubenstein 1986" />
[[File:Grevy's zebra group.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Three Grévy's zebras grazing |Group of Grévy's zebras grazing]]
In the more arid-living Grévy's zebras, adults have more fluid associations and adult males establish large [[Territory (animal)|territories]], marked by dung piles, and monopolise the females that enter them. This species lives in habitats with sparser resources and standing water and grazing areas may be separated. Groups of lactating females are able to remain in groups with nonlactating ones and usually gather at foraging areas. The most dominant males establish territories near watering holes, where more sexually receptive females gather. Subdominants have territories farther away, near foraging areas. Mares may wander through several territories but remain in one when they have young. Staying in a territory offers a female protection from harassment by outside males, as well as access to a renewable resource.<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Estes 1991" /><ref name="Rubenstein 1986" />

In all species, excess males gather in [[bachelor herd|bachelor group]]s. These are typically young males that are not yet ready to establish a harem or territory.<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Estes 1991" /><ref name="Rubenstein 1986">{{cite book |last=Rubenstein|first= D.

T. |chapter=Equidae}}</ref> Mountain zebra bachelor groups may also include young females that have recently left their natal group, as well as old males they have lost their harems. A territorial Grévy's zebra stallion may tolerate non-territorial bachelors who wander in their territory, however when a mare in [[oestrous]] is present the territorial stallion keeps other stallions at bay. Bachelors prepare for their adult roles with play fights and greeting/challenge rituals, which make up most of their activities.<ref name="Estes 1991" />

Fights between males usually occur over mates and involve biting and kicking. In plains zebra, stallions fight each other over recently matured mares to bring into their group and her family stallion will fight off other males trying to abduct her. As long as a harem stallion is healthy, he is not usually challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over, and even then, the new stallion gradually takes over, pushing the old one out without a fight. [[Agonistic behaviour]] between male Grévy's zebras occurs at the border of their territories.<ref name="Estes 1991" />

===Communication===
[[File:Equus quagga (185908025).jpg|thumb|right|alt=A pair of Plains zebra facing each other and rubbing heads on the others body | Plains zebras mutually grooming]]
Zebras produce a number of vocalisations and noises. The plains zebra has a distinctive, high-pitched contact call (commonly called "barking") heard as "a-''ha'', a-''ha'', a-''ha''" or "kwa-ha, kaw-ha, ha, ha".<ref name="Grub 1981" /> The call of the Grévy's zebra has been described as "something like a [[hippo]]'s grunt combined with a donkey's wheeze", while the mountain zebra is relatively silent. Loud snorting in zebras is associated with alarm. Squealing is usually made when in pain, but bachelors also squeal while play fighting. Zebras also communicate with visual displays, and the flexibility of their lips allows them to make complex facial expressions. Visual displays also incorporate the positions of the head, ears, and tail. A zebra may signal an intention to kick by laying back its ears and sometimes lashing the tail. Flattened ears, bared teeth, and abrupt movement of the heads may be used as threatening gestures, particularly among stallions.<ref name="Estes 1991" />

When meeting for the first time, or after they have separated, individuals may greet each other by rubbing and sniffing their noses followed by rubbing their cheeks, moving their noses along their bodies and sniffing each other's genitals. They then may rub and press their shoulders against each other and rest their heads on one another. This greeting is usually performed among harem or territorial males or among bachelor males playing.<ref name="Estes 1991" /> Plains and mountain zebras strengthen their social bonds with [[Social grooming|grooming]]. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, shoulder, and back with their teeth and lips. Grooming usually occurs between mothers and foals and between stallions and mares. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behaviour.<ref name="Estes 1991" />{{sfn|Caro|2016|p=143}}  Although Grévy's zebras do not perform social grooming, they do sometimes rub against another individual.<ref name="Churcher 1993" />

===Reproduction and parenting===

[[File:Grévy's Zebra mating.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A pair of Grévy's zebras mating | Captive Grévy's zebras mating]]
Among plains and mountain zebras, the adult females mate only with their harem stallion, while in Grévy's zebras, mating is more [[promiscuous]] and the males have larger testes for [[sperm competition]].<ref name="MacDonald" /><ref name="Ginsberg 1990">{{cite journal |last1=Ginsberg|first1= R|last2= Rubenstein|first2= D. I. |year=1990 |title=Sperm competition and variation in zebra mating behavior |journal=[[Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology]] |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=427–434 |doi=10.1007/BF00170901 |s2cid= 206771095|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~dir/pdf_dir/1990_Ginsberg&dir_BehEcolSo.pdf}}</ref> Oestrus in female zebras lasts five to ten days; physical signs include frequent urination, flowing mucus, and swollen, everted (inside out) labia. In addition, females in oestrous will stand with their hind legs spread and raise their tails when in the presence of a male. Males assess the female's reproductive state with a curled lip and bared teeth ([[flehmen response]]) and the female will solicit mating by backing in. The length of gestation varies by species; it is roughly 11–13 months, and most mares come into oestrus again within a few days after foaling, depending on conditions.<ref name="Estes 1991" />  In harem-holding species, oestrus in a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually nonexistent.<ref name="Grub 1981" />
[[File:Cape Mountain Zebras (Equus zebra) mare and foal suckling ... (31281408687).jpg|thumb|right|alt=Mountain zebra suckling a foal |Mountain zebra suckling a foal]]
Usually, a single foal is born, which is capable of running within an hour of birth.<ref name="MacDonald" /> A newborn zebra will follow anything that moves, so new mothers prevent other mares from approaching their foals while [[Imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] their own striping pattern, scent and vocalisation on them.<ref name="Churcher 1993" /> Within a few weeks, foals attempt to graze, but may continue to nurse for eight to thirteen months.<ref name="MacDonald" /> Living in an arid environment, Grévy's zebras have longer nursing intervals and do not drink water until they are three months old.<ref name="Becker 1990">{{cite journal |last1=Becker|first1= C.

In plains and mountain zebras, foals are cared for mostly by their mothers, but if threatened by pack-hunting hyenas and dogs, the entire group works together to protect all the young. The group forms a protective front with the foals in the centre, and the stallion will rush at predators that come too close.<ref name="Estes 1991" /> In Grévy's zebras, mothers may gather into small groups and leave their young in "[[Crèche (zoology)|kindergartens]]" guarded by a territorial male while searching for water.<ref name="Becker 1990" /> A stallion may look after a foal in his territory to ensure that the mother stays, though it may not be his.<ref name="Rubenstein 1986" /> By contrast, plains zebra stallions are generally intolerant of foals that are not theirs and may practice [[Infanticide (zoology)|infanticide]] and [[feticide]] via violence to the pregnant mare.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pluháček|first1=J|last2=Bartos|first2=L|year=2005|title=Further evidence for male infanticide and feticide in captive plains zebra, ''Equus burchelli''|journal=Folia Zoologica-Praha|volume=54|issue=3|pages=258–262|url=https://www.ivb.cz/wp-content/uploads/54_258-262.pdf}}</ref>

===Cultural significance===
[[File:Brandberg-Peintures rupestres San (4).jpg|thumb|alt=San rock art depicting a zebra |[[San rock art]] depicting a zebra]]
With their distinctive black-and-white stripes, zebras are among the most recognisable mammals. They have been associated with beauty and grace, with naturalist [[Thomas Pennant]] describing them in 1781 as "the most elegant of quadrupeds". Zebras have been popular in photography, with some wildlife photographers describing them as the most photogenic animal. Zebras have become staples in children's stories and wildlife-themed art, such as depictions of [[Noah's Ark]]. They are known for being among the last animals to be featured in the dictionary and in children's alphabet books where they are often used to represent the letter 'Z'.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=10–13, 189}} Zebra stripes are also popularly used for body paintings, dress, furniture and architecture.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=40–41, 134–140}}

Zebras have been featured in [[African art]] and [[African culture|culture]] for millennia. They are depicted in [[rock art]] in Southern Africa dating from 28,000 to 20,000 years ago, though not as commonly as antelope species like [[Common eland|eland]]. How the zebra got its stripes has been the subject of [[African folklore|folk tales]], some of which involve it being scorched by fire. The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] proverb "a man without culture is like a zebra without stripes" has become popular in Africa and beyond. The [[San people]] associated zebra stripes with water, rain and lighting because of its dazzling pattern, and [[water spirit]]s were conceived of having zebra stripes.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=37–44}}
[[File:Zebra Stripes Glen Raven 1908.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Illustration of a business's "Zebra Stripes" logo | "Zebra Stripes," trademark for the defunct [[Glen Raven, Inc.|Glen Raven Cotton Mills Company]]]]
For the [[Shona people]], the zebra is a [[totem]] animal and is praised in a poem as an "iridescent and glittering creature". Its stripes have symbolised the joining of male and female and at the ruined city of [[Great Zimbabwe]], zebra stripes decorate what is believed to be a ''domba'', a premarital school meant to initiate girls into adulthood. In the [[Shona language]], the name ''madhuve'' means "woman/women of the zebra totem" and is a given name for girls in [[Zimbabwe]]. The plains zebra is the [[national animal]] of Botswana and zebras have been depicted on stamps during [[Scramble for Africa|colonial]] and post-colonial Africa. For people of the [[African diaspora]], the zebra represented the politics of race and identity, being both black and white.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=45–50}}

In cultures outside of its range, the zebra has been thought of as a more exotic alternative to the horse; the comic book character [[Sheena, Queen of the Jungle]], is depicted riding a zebra and explorer [[Osa Johnson]] was photographed riding one.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=166–168, 192–194}} The film ''[[Racing Stripes]]'' features a captive zebra ostracised from the horses and ending up being ridden by a rebellious girl.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|p=194}} Zebras have been featured as characters in animated films like ''[[Khumba]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'' and the [[Madagascar (franchise)|''Madagascar'' films]] and television series such as ''[[Zou (TV series)|Zou]]''.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=188, 200–201}}

Zebras have been popular subjects for [[Abstract art|abstract]], [[modernism|modernist]] and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] artists. Such art includes [[Christopher Wood (painter)|Christopher Wood]]'s ''Zebra and Parachute'', [[Lucian Freud]]'s ''The Painter's Room'' and ''Quince on a Blue Table'' and the various paintings of [[Mary Fedden]] and [[Sidney Nolan]]. [[Victor Vasarely]]  depicted zebras as mere bands of black and white and joined in a [[jigsaw puzzle]] fashion. [[Carel Weight]]'s ''Escape of the Zebra from the Zoo during an Air Raid'' was based on a real life incident of a zebra escaping during [[London Zoo#London Zoo during the Second World War|the bombing of London Zoo]] and consists of four panels like a comic book.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=141–149}} Zebras have lent themselves to products and advertisements, notably for 'Zebra Grate Polish' cleaning supplies by British manufacturer [[Reckitt and Sons]] and Japanese pen manufacturer [[Zebra (pen manufacturer)|Zebra Co., Ltd.]].{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=128–131}}

===Captivity===
[[File:George Stubbs - Zebra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|alt= A portrait of a zebra by George Stubbs | ''Zebra'' (1763) by [[George Stubbs]]. A portrait of [[Queen Charlotte]]'s zebra]]
Zebras have been kept in captivity since at least the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=55–57}} In later times, captive zebras have been shipped around the world, often for diplomatic reasons. In 1261, Sultan [[Baibars]] of [[Bahri dynasty|Egypt]] established an embassy with [[Alfonso X of Castile]] and sent a zebra and other exotic animals as gifts. In 1417, a zebra was sent to the [[Yongle Emperor]] of China from Somalia as a gift for the Chinese people. The fourth [[Mughal emperors|Mughal]] emperor [[Jahangir]] received a zebra from Ethiopia in 1621 and [[Ustad Mansur]] made a painting of it. In the 1670s, [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian Emperor]] [[Yohannes I]] exported two zebras to the Dutch governor of [[Jakarta]]. These animals would eventually be given by the Dutch to the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] of Japan.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8GxaDwAAQBAJ&newbks=0&lpg=PP1&pg=PT59 58–61], 65–66}}

When [[Queen Charlotte]] received a zebra as a wedding gift in 1762, the animal became a source of fascination for the people of Britain. Many flocked to see it at its [[paddock]] at [[Buckingham Palace]]. It soon became the subject of humour and satire, being referred to as "The Queen's Ass", and was the subject of an oil painting by [[George Stubbs]] in 1763. The zebra also gained a reputation for being ill-tempered and kicked at visitors.{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|pp=76–78, 81}} In 1882, Ethiopia sent a zebra to French president [[Jules Grévy]], and the species it belonged to was named in his honour.<ref name="Prothero 2003" />

Attempts to [[domesticate]] zebras were largely unsuccessful. It is possible that having evolved under pressure from the many large predators of Africa, including early humans, they became more aggressive, thus making domestication more difficult.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Story Of... Zebra and the Puzzle of African Animals |website=PBS |access-date=13 August 2020|url=https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/zebra.html}}</ref> However, zebras have been [[animal training|trained]] and [[Tame animal|tamed]] throughout history. In Rome, zebras are recorded to have pulled chariots during [[gladiator]] games starting in the reign of [[Caracalla]] (198 to 217 AD).{{sfn|Plumb|Shaw|2018|p=56}} In the late 19th century, the zoologist [[Walter Rothschild]] trained some zebras to draw a carriage in England, which he drove to Buckingham Palace to demonstrate the tame character of zebras to the public. However, he did not ride on them as he realised that they were too small and aggressive.<ref>{{cite web |author=Young|first= R. |title=Can Zebras Be Domesticated and Trained? |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/09/04/can_zebras_be_domesticated_and_trained.html |access-date=4 September 2013 |date=23 May 2013}}</ref> In the early 20th century, German colonial officers in [[German East Africa]] tried to use zebras for both driving and riding, with limited success.<ref>{{cite book |author=Gann|first= L. |last2=Duignan|first2= Peter |year=1977 |title=The Rulers of German Africa, 1884–1914 |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |page=206 |isbn=978-0-8047-6588-6}}</ref>

===Conservation===
[[File:Equus zebra hartmannae fur skin.jpg|thumb|upright|left|alt=Mountain zebra hide | Mountain zebra hide]]
As of 2016–2019, the [[IUCN Red List]] of mammals lists the Grévy's zebra as [[Endangered species|endangered]], the mountain zebra as [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and the plains zebra as [[Near-threatened species|near-threatened]]. Grévy's zebra populations are estimated at less than 2,000 mature individuals, but they are stable. Mountain zebras number near 35,000 individuals and their population appears to be increasing. Plains zebra are estimated to number 150,000–250,000 with a decreasing population trend. Human intervention has fragmented zebra ranges and populations. Zebras are threatened by hunting for their hide and meat, and habitat change from farming. They also compete with livestock for food and water and fencing blocks their migration routes.<ref name="iucn-grevyi">{{cite iucn |author=Rubenstein|first= D. |author2=Low Mackey|first2= B. |author3=Davidson|first3= Z.
