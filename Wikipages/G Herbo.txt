Fletcher shared her story on [[Instagram]] on Thursday, April 18, stating, "He kicked my door down to get in my house because I wouldn't let him in, beat the f**k out of me in front of my son. Then he took my son outside to his friends and had them drive off with my son, hid all my knifes in my house, broke my phone and locked me inside and beat the f**out of me again…"{{citation needed|date=April 2020}} She stated there were physical signs of abuse as well, such as a black eye, and scrapes, cuts and bruises all over her body. Wright was released one week later on $2,000 bail.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ajc.com/news/crime--law/just-rapper-arrested-accused-assaulting-his-child-mother-atlanta/wPZNviq7EmrKYhkHWs3HsM/|title=Rapper arrested, accused of assaulting his child's mother in Atlanta|last=Hansen|first=Zachary|date=April 18, 2019|website=The Atlanta Journal-Constitution|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-g-herbo-arrested-for-battery-accused-by-childs-mother-of-beating-her|title=Rapper G Herbo arrested for battery, accused by son's mother of beating her in front of their child|last=Hopkins|first=Anna|date=April 19, 2019|website=Fox News|access-date=April 24, 2019}}</ref> Upon his release, he took to Instagram Live to discuss the altercation with Fletcher. In the video session, Herbo stated that Fletcher had stolen jewelry from his mother's house. Specifically he stated, "I've been quiet all this time. I ain't do no insurance claim or try to get you locked up. Nothing. You told me to come to Atlanta to get the jewelry back."

On December 2, 2020, Wright and several associates, Antonio "T-Glo" Strong, Wright's promoter and manager; South Side rapper Joseph "Joe Rodeo" Williams; and alleged co-conspirators Steven Hayes Jr., Demario Sorrells and Terrence Bender, all from Chicago, were indicted on 14 federal charges that included wire fraud, and aggravated identity theft, in a federal court in Massachusetts.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Meisner|first=Jason|title=Designer puppies, private jets and a Jamaican villa: Chicago rappers charged in Massachusetts with elaborate fraud scheme|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/criminal-justice/ct-chicago-rappers-lil-herb-fraud-charges-20201202-6j7qbbcbszebfadsnx37ihsvw4-story.html|access-date=December 3, 2020|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> It was alleged that Wright and his associates charged expensive trips, bought designer puppies, rented luxury villas in Jamaica, private jets, and all of these luxury services and purchases were from using stolen identification.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Camarillo|first=Emmanuel|date=December 2, 2020|title=Chicago rapper G Herbo charged in wire fraud scheme|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/2020/12/2/22149252/chicago-rapper-g-herbo-charged-wire-fraud-scheme|access-date=December 3, 2020|website=Chicago Sun-Times}}</ref> It is alleged that the fraud amounted to millions of dollars over a four-year period dating back to 2016.<ref>{{Cite magazine|title=Rapper G Herbo Charged in Fraud Scheme|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/9493093/g-herbo-fraud-scheme|access-date=December 3, 2020|magazine=Billboard}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Bloom|first=Madison|title=G Herbo Facing Federal Fraud Charges|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/g-herbo-facing-federal-fraud-charges/|access-date=December 3, 2020|website=Pitchfork|date=December 2, 2020}}</ref> Wright has maintained his innocence and according to his management team, he "looks forward to establishing his innocence in court".<ref name="Statement" />

== Charity ==
In 2018, Wright contributed to the redevelopment of a former elementary school in Chicago, Anthony Overton Elementary School. In this building, Wright's goal was to include equipment that could potentially help young people who want to become musicians. He also aimed to include free programs and sports to keep youngsters busy so they are not involved in street life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/block-beat-triibe-herbo-swervo-overton-machine-mikkey/Content?oid=58892133|title=It's G Herbo's time to give back|last=TRiiBE|first=The|date=September 26, 2018|website=Chicago Reader|access-date=May 5, 2019}}</ref>
In July 2020, Wright launched Swervin' Through Stress, an initiative that provides Black youths with therapeutic resources to improve their mental health over a 12-week course. The project was inspired by his own experiences and the truama others faced within his community, as well as his [[complex post-traumatic stress disorder]] which stemmed from his own earlier therapy sessions. He elaborated, "I don't want to be that guy to have all the resources to change my neighborhood, change my city and the youth and do nothing with it. That's why it's so important to me to be honest".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ent-g-herbo-ptds-chicago-violence-0731-20200730-m4klzq2mcvbe5mkj66umsmly2u-story.html|title=Chicago rapper G Herbo, in looking for a path out of the cycles of violence in his life, started a Black mental health outreach project|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=julious|first=Britt|date=July 30, 2020|access-date=December 25, 2020}}</ref>
