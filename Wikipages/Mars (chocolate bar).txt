'''Mars''', commonly known as '''Mars bar''', is the name of two varieties of [[chocolate bar]] produced by [[Mars, Incorporated]]. It was first manufactured in 1932 in [[Slough]], England by [[Forrest Mars, Sr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.com/uk/en/brands/chocolate.aspx|title=Mars Chocolate|access-date=26 April 2016}}</ref> In its British version the bar consists of [[caramel]] and [[nougat]] coated with [[milk chocolate]]. An American version of the Mars bar was produced which had nougat and toasted almonds covered in milk chocolate; later, caramel was added to the recipe as well. The American version was discontinued in 2002, then revived in a slightly different form the following year under the name "Snickers Almond".

In most of the world, a Mars bar is a candy bar with nougat and caramel, coated with milk chocolate, but without almonds. In the United States it is called a [[Milky Way (chocolate bar)|Milky Way]].<ref name="practicallyedible">{{cite web|url=http://www.practicallyedible.com/edible.nsf/pages/marsbars |title=Mars bars |publisher=Practically Edible, "The Web's Biggest Food Encyclopedia" |access-date=7 August 2007 |quote=What is sold outside the US as a "Mars bar" is sold in the US as "Milky Way".

It was first manufactured under the Mars bar name in 1932 in [[Slough]], England by [[Forrest Mars, Sr.]], son of American candy maker [[Franklin Clarence Mars|Frank C. Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mars.com/uk/en/brands/chocolate.aspx|title=Mars Chocolate|access-date=26 April 2016}}</ref> He modelled it after his father's Milky Way bar, which was already popular in the US, adjusting the recipe to better suit European tastes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marsbar.co.uk/history/ |title=. Of the people working in the factory Alexander Wind was a major influence. He came up with the idea for the caramel filling in the bar which had previously not existed. The history of Mars can be traced back to 1932 |website=Marsbar.co.uk |access-date=23 June 2010 }}</ref><ref name="H50">{{cite book |last1=Berry |first1=Steve |last2=Norman |first2=Phil |title=A History of Sweets in 50 Wrappers |date=2014 |publisher=[[The Friday Project]] |location=London |isbn=9780007575480 |pages=64–65}}</ref> He had a staff of twelve people, and originally advertised it as using Cadbury's chocolate [[Couverture chocolate|couverture]].<ref name="H50" /><ref>''Sweet Talk: the Secret History of Confectionery'', Whittaker, Nicholas, Gollancz, 1997</ref> The bar and the proportions of the main components have changed over the years. With minor variations, this version is sold worldwide, except for the US, and is packaged in a black wrapper with red gold-edged lettering.

In 2002, the Mars bar was reformulated and its logo was updated with a more cursive appearance except in Australia where it still has the pre-2002 logo. Its price also increased.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/netnotes/article/0,,669665,00.html|title=Guardian Unlimited, "Mars bar"|date=18 March 2002|access-date=23 July 2006}}</ref> The nougat was made lighter, the chocolate on top became thinner, and the overall weight of the bar was reduced slightly. The slogan "Pleasure you can't measure" was intended to appeal more to women and youths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.just-food.com/article.aspx?id=72400|title=UK: Mars re-branding offers consumers pleasure, not power|work=just-food.com}}</ref>

Various sizes are made (sizes as of 2008): miniature bars called "Fun Size" (19.7&nbsp;g) and "Snack Time" (36.5&nbsp;g) (both sold in multiple packs); a larger multi-pack size of 54&nbsp;g; the regular sized single 58&nbsp;g bar and a "king-size" 84&nbsp;g bar which has since been replaced by "Mars Duo" (85&nbsp;g) – a pack that contains 2 smaller bars of 42.5&nbsp;g each instead of 1 large one. The regular 58&nbsp;g single bar contains 260 calories.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

In the second half of 2008, Mars UK reduced the weight of regular bars from 62.5&nbsp;g to 58&nbsp;g. Although the reduction in size was not publicised at the time, Mars claimed the change was designed to help tackle the obesity crisis in the UK. The company later confirmed that the real reason for the change was rising costs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/howaboutthat/5432642/Mars-bars-shrink-in-size.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Mars bars shrink in size | date=3 June 2009 | access-date=12 May 2010}}</ref> In 2013, the "standard" Mars bar was further reduced to 51&nbsp;g, bringing the change to around 20% in 5 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marsbar.com/|title=Mars®|author=Linney Group|work=marsbar.com|access-date=3 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208045212/http://marsbar.com/|archive-date=8 February 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In May 2009, the Mars bar size reduced from 60g to 53g in Australia, citing portion sizes and the obesity debate as the primary driver.<ref>[http://www.couriermail.com.au/news/national/mars-bars-size-slashed-but-price-to-stay-the-same/news-story/38142735a2faaa419e841e6666] {{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.afr.com/companies/media-and-marketing/smaller-mars-a-taste-of-things-to-come-20090511-jmvwf |title= Smaller Mars a taste of things to come |newspaper=[[The Australian Financial Review]]|date=11 May 2009|access-date=26 October 2021}} {{subscription required|s}}</ref>

=== United States ===
[[File:US-Mars-Wrapper-Small.jpg|right|thumb|A U.S Mars bar]]
In the United States a Mars bar is a candy bar with [[nougat]] and toasted [[almond]]s coated with [[milk chocolate]]. The same candy bar is known outside the United States as a Mars Almond bar. Originally it didn't have [[caramel]], but at some point caramel was added to it.

It was discontinued in 2002,<ref name="candyfavorites">{{cite web |url=http://www.candyfavorites.com/Snickers-Almond-Mars-bar-pr-295.html |title= Snickers Almond Mars bar |access-date=7 August 2007 |website=Candyfavorites.com|quote=Snickers Almond "is the replacement for the classic Mars bar"}}</ref> relaunched in January 2010 (initially exclusively through [[Walmart]] stores), discontinued again at the end of 2011,{{cn|date=November 2016}} and relaunched again in September 2016 by Ethel M. Chocolates, a gourmet chocolate subsidiary of Mars, Inc.. The 2016 version is the "original American recipe", which doesn't have caramel. It's available in their stores and on Amazon.com.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-relaunch-of-a-blast-from-the-past---ethel-m-chocolates-brings-back-original-1932-mars-bar-300522193.html|title=The Relaunch of a Blast from the Past – Ethel M Chocolates Brings Back Original 1932 Mars Bar|last=Chocolates|first=Ethel M|website=www.prnewswire.com|language=en|access-date=20 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foodandwine.com/desserts/candy/original-mars-bar-comeback|title=The Original Mars Bar Is Back|work=Food & Wine|access-date=20 September 2017|language=en}}</ref>

In 2003, the company introduced a replacement called [[Snickers]] Almond. It's similar to the Mars bar, containing nougat, almonds, caramel, and a milk chocolate coating,<ref name="candyfavorites" /> although there are some differences. For example, the almonds are in smaller pieces in Snickers Almond than in the Mars bar.

The European version of the Mars bar is also sold in some United States grocery stores.

== Custom packaging ==
[[File:Mars Believe Bar.jpg|thumb|''Mars Believe'']]
The Original Mars bar in "Believe" packaging was sold in the UK from 18 April 2006 until the end of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in July. "Believe" took prominence on the packaging ("Original Mars" appeared in smaller print) to indicate support for the [[England national football team]]. Advertising in other nations of the UK was tailored to reflect their own teams after the public condemnation, although in Scotland the "Believe" packaging was still used – causing negative publicity.<ref>{{cite web|last=Davidson |first=Lynn |title=We're Not Buying It |publisher=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |year=2006 |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=17164545&method=full&siteid=66633&headline=we-re-not-buying-it--name_page.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903150750/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid%3D17164545%26method%3Dfull%26siteid%3D66633%26headline%3Dwe-re-not-buying-it--name_page.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=3 September 2009 |access-date=19 February 2008 }}</ref>

On 30 July 2008, the [[Tasmania]]n government announced that it had secured a major sponsor, Mars for a bid to enter the [[Australian Football League]] in a deal worth $4&nbsp;million over 3 years and will temporarily change the name of its top-selling chocolate bar in Australia to Believe, to help promote Tasmania's cause.<ref>Mars has committed $4&nbsp;million over three years and will temporarily change the name of its top-selling chocolate bar in Australia to Believe, to help promote Tasmania's cause.</ref>

Mars were re-branded "Hopp" ("Go!" in English) in Switzerland during [[UEFA Euro 2008]]. Like the "Believe" packaging sold in the UK in 2006, "Original Mars" was also shown in smaller print.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mars/Hopp |publisher=Wirz Gruppe |url=http://www.wirz.ch/wirz-gruppe/totalwork/mars-hopp/ |access-date=9 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105020942/http://www.wirz.ch/wirz-gruppe/totalwork/mars-hopp/ |archive-date=5 January 2011  }}</ref>

In 2010, to promote England's involvement in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the background of the UK Mars packaging became the St. George cross.

A similar dish has appeared in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]] where [[momo (dumpling)|momo (dumplings)]] have used Mars bars as fillings.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Recalls ==
In July 2005, Mars bars, along with the [[Snickers]] bar, were recalled due to an anonymous extortion attempt against [[Star City Casino]] in Sydney. The extortionist claimed to have poisoned seven Mars and Snickers bars at random stores in [[New South Wales]]. As a result, [[Masterfoods]] Corporation, the company that manufactures Mars bars in Australia, recalled the entire Mars and Snickers product from store shelves in New South Wales. Nineteen people were possibly affected, with two being admitted to hospital. In the later half of August 2005, the threat to the public was deemed negligible and the bars returned to shelves.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In February 2016, Mars, Snickers and various other Mars, Inc. chocolate products were recalled in 55 countries in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The precautionary recall was issued after a customer found pieces of plastic in a Snickers bar purchased in Germany. The error was traced back to a Mars, Inc. factory in [[Veghel]], The Netherlands.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mars recalls chocolate in 55 countries|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-35642075|access-date=23 February 2016|work=BBC News|date=23 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mars Recalls Chocolate Products in 55 Countries|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/24/business/international/mars-candy-bar-recall-germany.html|access-date=7 March 2016|work=New York Times|date=23 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Hanif|first1=Nadeem|title=UAE part of worldwide chocolate recall by Mars|url=http://www.thenational.ae/uae/health/uae-part-of-worldwide-chocolate-recall-by-mars|access-date=7 March 2016|work=The National|date=24 February 2016}}</ref>

== Animal products controversy ==
In May 2007, Mars UK announced that Mars bars, along with many of their other products such as [[Snickers]], [[Maltesers]], [[Galaxy Minstrels|Minstrels]] and [[Twix]] would no longer be suitable for vegetarians because of the introduction of [[rennet]], a chemical sourced from calves' stomachs used in the production of [[whey]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6653175.stm|title=Mars starts using animal products|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News website}}</ref>

The [[rabbi]]nical authorities declared that the products remained [[kosher]] for Jewish consumption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theus.org.uk/jewish_living/file/?file_id=184 |title=LBD Kashrut Division&nbsp;— It's Kosher anyWhey! |work=theus.org.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406120947/http://www.theus.org.uk/jewish_living/file/?file_id=184 |archive-date=6 April 2012  }}</ref>

The decision was condemned by several groups, with the [[Vegetarian Society]] stating that "at a time when more and more consumers are concerned about the provenance of their food, Mars' decision to use non-vegetarian whey is a backward step".

Mars later abandoned these plans, stating that it became "very clear, very quickly" that it had made a mistake.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6673549.stm| work=BBC News| title=Mars bars get veggie status back| date=20 May 2007| access-date=12 May 2010}}</ref>

== Economics ==
It has been observed on several occasions that the price of a Mars bar correlates fairly accurately with the change in value of the [[pound sterling]] since [[World War II]], much in the way that the [[Big Mac Index]] has proven to be a good indicator of the actual relative purchasing power of world currencies.<ref name="ft_inflation">{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9f128868-68b4-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html|title=Mars bar|work=ft.com|publisher=Financial Times website|author=Nico Colchester Fellowship|date=26 January 2001|access-date=13 January 2007}}</ref>

== Popular culture ==
Northern Irish pop-punk band [[The Undertones]] wrote and recorded a song called "[[Jimmy Jimmy (song)#Track listing|Mars Bars]]", released as a [[B-side]] in 1979.
