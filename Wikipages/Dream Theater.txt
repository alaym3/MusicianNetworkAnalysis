<!-- There's not much discussion going on the talk page, so I've condensed the lead down by a massive amount. Hopefully this will suffice. If not, I've left the Lead Too Long tag here, just commented out: {{Lead too long|date=June 2018}} -->
'''Dream Theater''' is an American [[progressive metal]] band formed in 1985 under the name '''Majesty''' by [[John Petrucci]], [[John Myung]] and [[Mike Portnoy]] while they attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. They subsequently dropped out of their studies to concentrate further on the band that would eventually become Dream Theater. Though a number of lineup changes followed, the three original members remained together until September 8, 2010, when Portnoy left the band and he was replaced several months later by [[Mike Mangini]]. [[James LaBrie]] has been the lead singer of Dream Theater since 1991, replacing [[Charlie Dominici]] who had left the band two years earlier. Dream Theater's first keyboardist, [[Kevin Moore]], left the band after three albums and was replaced by [[Derek Sherinian]] in 1995 after a period of touring. After one album with Sherinian, the band replaced him with current keyboardist [[Jordan Rudess]] in 1999.

To date, Dream Theater has released fifteen studio albums. Their first album, ''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]'', was released in 1989 and is the only record to feature Dominici on vocals. The band's highest-selling release is their second album ''[[Images and Words]]'' (1992), which reached No.&nbsp;61 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name="charts">Billboard Chart history for Dream Theater can be seen at [{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dream theater|chart=all}} Billboard.com].</ref> Both the albums ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]'' (1994) and ''[[Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]'' (2002) also entered the charts at No.&nbsp;32 and No.&nbsp;46, respectively, and received critical acclaim.

==History==
===Formation (1985–1987)===
Dream Theater was formed in Massachusetts in 1985 when guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John Myung, and drummer Mike Portnoy decided to form a band while attending the Berklee College of Music. The trio started by covering [[Rush (band)|Rush]] and [[Iron Maiden]] songs in the rehearsal rooms at Berklee.

Myung, Petrucci, and Portnoy joined together on the name Majesty for their newly formed group. According to ''[[Score (Dream Theater album)|The Score So Far...]]'' documentary, they were waiting in line for tickets to a Rush concert at the Berklee Performance Center while listening to the band on a boom box. Portnoy commented that the ending of the song "[[Bastille Day (song)|Bastille Day]]" (from the album ''[[Caress of Steel]]'') sounded "majestic". It was then decided that Majesty would be the band's name.<ref name="score so far">This was referenced in the documentary "The Score so Far", on the second disc of the ''[[Score (Dream Theater album)|Score]]'' DVD.</ref>

The trio then set out to fill the remaining positions in the group. Petrucci asked his high school bandmate [[Kevin Moore]] to play the keyboard. After he accepted the position, another friend from home, [[Chris Collins (singer)|Chris Collins]], was recruited as lead vocalist after band members heard him sing a cover of "Queen of the Reich" by [[Queensrÿche]].<ref>Portnoy, Mike (2003). "The Majesty Demos 1985-1986" [CD Liner Notes]. New York: Ytsejam Records.</ref> During this time, Portnoy, Petrucci, and Myung's hectic schedules forced them to abandon their studies to concentrate on their music, as they did not feel they could learn more in college. Moore also left his college, [[State University of New York at Fredonia|SUNY Fredonia]], to concentrate on the band.

{{listen|filename=Dream_Theater_-_Another_Won.ogg|title="Another Won"|description="Another Won" from ''[[The Majesty Demos]]''}}
The beginning months of 1986 were filled with various concert dates in and around the New York City area. During this time, the band recorded a collection of demos, titled ''[[The Majesty Demos]]''. The initial run of 1,000 sold out within six months, and dubbed copies of the cassette became popular within the progressive metal scene. The ''Majesty Demos'' are still available in their original tape format today, despite being released officially on CD, through Mike Portnoy's YtseJam Records.

In November 1986, after a few months of writing and performing together, Chris Collins was fired.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}} After a year of trying to find a replacement, [[Charlie Dominici]], who was far older and more experienced than anyone else in the band, successfully auditioned for the group.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prog-sphere.com/interviews/charlie-dominici |title=Charlie Dominici - A Trilogy Concluded, a Career to be Continued |last=Savić |first=Nikola |date=June 16, 2010 |website=Prog-sphere.com |access-date=August 29, 2018}}</ref> With the stability that Dominici's appointment brought to Majesty, they began to increase the number of shows played in the New York City area, gaining a considerable amount of exposure.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Shortly after hiring Dominici, a Las Vegas group also named Majesty<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gabbo.net/dt/faq/ |title=The Dream Theater FAQ – Graphic Version |publisher=Gabbo.net |access-date=January 2, 2009}}</ref> threatened legal action for [[intellectual property infringement]] related to the use of their name, so the band was forced to adopt a new moniker. Various possibilities were proposed and tested, among them Glasser, Magus, and M1, which were all rejected, though the band did go as Glasser for about a week, with poor reactions from fans. Eventually, Portnoy's father suggested the name Dream Theater, the name of a small theater in [[Monterey, California]], and the name stuck.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLRo9RT539k |title=Mike Portnoy – Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |publisher=YouTube |date=April 1, 2015 |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

===''When Dream and Day Unite'' (1988–1990)===
With their new name and band stability, Dream Theater concentrated on writing more material while playing more concerts in New York and in neighboring states. This eventually attracted the attention of Mechanic Records, a division of [[MCA Inc.|MCA]]. Dream Theater signed their first record contract with Mechanic on June 23, 1988<ref name="WDADU Demos">Portnoy, Mike (2004). And Nathan Edmonds help produce "When Dream and Day Unite Demos" 1987-1989 [CD Liner Notes]. New York: YtseJam Records.</ref> and set out to record their debut album. The band recorded the album at Kajem Victory Studios in [[Gladwyne, Pennsylvania]]. Recording the basic tracks took about 10 days, and the entire album was completed in about 3 weeks.<ref name="Charlie Dominici">Dominici, Charlie. When Dream And Day Unite liner notes (2004 re-release).</ref>

''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]'' was released in 1989 to far less fanfare than the band had anticipated. Mechanic ended up breaking the majority of the financial promises they had made to Dream Theater prior to signing their contract, so the band was restricted to playing around New York City. The promotional tour for the album consisted of just five concerts, all of which were relatively local. Their first show was at Sundance in [[Bay Shore, New York]] opening for the classic rock power trio [[Zebra (American band)|Zebra]].<ref name="tourography">{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/dates/tourography/?tour=4 |title=Mike Portnoy.com The Official Website |website=Mikeportnoy.com |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

After the fourth show, [[Charlie Dominici]] was let go because the band was starting to feel the limitations of his voice based upon the vocal style they wanted. The band was looking for a singer with a style more like [[Bruce Dickinson]] or [[Geoff Tate]], and Dominici's stage presence was not what they wanted for a front man. Shortly after, however, the band [[Marillion]] asked Dream Theater to open for them at a gig at the Ritz in New York, so Dominici was given the opportunity to perform one last time.<ref name="tourography"/> It would be another two years before Dream Theater had a replacement vocalist.

=== Addition of James LaBrie and ''Images and Words'' (1991–1993) ===

[[File:James LaBrie 2.jpg|thumb|left|190px|James LaBrie joined the band in January 1991 and has been their vocalist ever since.]]
Following Dominici's departure, Dream Theater fought successfully to be released from their contract with Mechanic, and set about auditioning singers and writing material for their next album. In their search for a new singer, they auditioned over 200 people, among them former [[Fates Warning]] front man [[John Arch]]. John ultimately decided that his personal commitments were more important and he opted not to join the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fateswarning.com/Media/Interviews/1995/19950101.aspx |title=John Arch Interview by Jeff Wagner (1995) |publisher=Fateswarning.com |access-date=February 9, 2012}}</ref> On June 9, 1990, at a gig at Sundance in Bay Shore, New York, Dream Theater introduced Steve Stone as their new singer after playing half the set as an instrumental band. Stone had successfully recorded demos with Dream Theater, but he was fired following a single, ill-fated live performance. According to Mike Portnoy, Stone moved around the stage in a rather odd manner, seemingly doing a bad impression of [[Bruce Dickinson]]. Additionally, he shouted "Scream for me Long Beach!" several times throughout the show (Dickinson can be heard saying this on Iron Maiden's live album ''[[Live After Death]]''), although they were actually performing in Bay Shore.<ref name="steve stone">{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/dates/MPTourography/ShowInfo.aspx?showId=29 |title=Mike Portnoy.com The Official Website |website=Mikeportnoy.com |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref> The audience was immediately turned off by the new singer.  It was five months before Dream Theater played another show, this time all-instrumental (under the name YtseJam). Until 1991, the band remained focused in an attempt to hire another singer and writing additional music.<ref name="tourography" /> It was during this period that they wrote the majority of what would become ''Images and Words'' (1992).

In January 1991, the band received a demo tape from [[James LaBrie|Kevin James LaBrie]], of [[glam metal]] band [[Winter Rose (band)|Winter Rose]].<ref name="Larkin2011">{{cite book|author=Colin Larkin|title=The Encyclopedia of Popular Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_NNmFiUnSmUC&pg=PA2006-IA1908|date=May 27, 2011|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=978-0-85712-595-8|pages=2006–}}</ref> The band had received the tape just before they were about to commit to another singer. The band was so impressed by his demo that he was flown from Canada to New York for an audition. LaBrie jammed on three songs with the band, and was immediately hired to fill the vocalist position. Once recruited, LaBrie decided to drop his first name to avoid confusion with the other Kevin in the band. For the next few months, the band returned to playing live shows (still mostly around NYC), while working on vocal parts for the music written before acquiring LaBrie. [[Derek Shulman]] and [[Atco Records]] (now [[East West Records|East West]]), a division of [[Elektra Records]], signed Dream Theater to a seven-album contract based on a three-song demo (later made available as "The Atco Demos" through the Dream Theater [[fan club]]).

The first album to be recorded under their new record contract was ''[[Images and Words]]'' (1992). For promotion, the label released a CD Single and [[music video|video clip]] for the song "[[Another Day (Dream Theater song)|Another Day]]", but neither made significant commercial impact. The song "[[Pull Me Under]]", however, managed to garner a high level of radio airplay without any organized promotion from the band or their label. In response, ATCO produced a video clip for "Pull Me Under", which saw heavy rotation on [[MTV]]. A third video clip was produced for "[[Take the Time]]", but it was not nearly as successful as "Pull Me Under".

The success of "Pull Me Under", combined with relentless touring throughout the U.S. and [[Japan]], caused ''Images and Words'' to achieve gold record certification in the States and platinum status in Japan. A tour of [[Europe]] followed in 1993, which included a show at [[London]]'s famed [[Marquee Club]]. The show was recorded and released as ''[[Live at the Marquee (Dream Theater album)|Live at the Marquee]]'', Dream Theater's first official live album. Additionally, a video compilation of their Japanese concerts (mixed in with documentary-style footage of the off-stage portion of the tour) was released as ''[[Images and Words: Live in Tokyo]]''.

===''Awake'' and Kevin Moore's departure (1994–1995)===
{| style="float:right;"
|-
|{{listen|filename=A Mind Beside Itself - II - Voices (Dream Theater song - sample).ogg|title="A Mind Beside Itself: II – Voices"|description="Voices" from ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]''.}}
|}

Eager to work on fresh material, Dream Theater retreated to the studio in May 1994. ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]'', Dream Theater's third studio album, was released on October 4, 1994 amidst a storm of fan controversy. Shortly before the album was mixed, Moore had announced to the rest of the band that he would be quitting Dream Theater to concentrate on his own musical interests, since he was no longer interested in touring or the style of music which Dream Theater performed.<ref>EastWest Records Press Release.</ref> As a result, the band had to scramble to find a replacement keyboardist before a tour could be considered.

Former [[Yngwie Malmsteen]]/[[Dio (band)|Dio]] keyboardist [[Jens Johansson]], who would go on to become a member of [[Stratovarius]], was among the biggest names to audition, but the band members were eager to fill the position with keyboardist [[Jordan Rudess]]. Portnoy and Petrucci had come across Rudess in Keyboard Magazine, where he was recognized as "best new talent" in the readers' poll. The two invited him to play a trial gig with the band at the [[Concrete Marketing|Concrete]] [[Foundations Forum]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name="tourography" /> Although the show was a success, and Rudess was asked to fill the keyboardist position permanently, he opted to tour with The [[Dixie Dregs]] instead, since it granted him more personal latitude. Dream Theater hired fellow Berklee alumnus [[Derek Sherinian]], who had previously toured and recorded with [[Alice Cooper]] and [[Kiss (band)|KISS]], to fill in for the ''Waking Up the World Tour''. By the conclusion of the tour, the band decided to take Sherinian on as Moore's full-time replacement.<ref name="score so far" />

===''A Change of Seasons'', ''Falling into Infinity'' (1995–1998)===
{| style="float:right;"
|-
|{{listen|filename=Dream_Theater_-_ACOS.ogg|title="A Change of Seasons"|description="Carpe Diem/The Darkest of Winters" bridge from ''[[A Change of Seasons]]''.}}
|}

Once again finding themselves with a new member, the band did not immediately start working on new material. Fans around the world, united on the YtseJam [[Electronic mailing list|Mailing List]] (the most popular form of communication between Dream Theater fans at that point), had begun to put pressure on the band to officially release the song "[[A Change of Seasons]]". This had been written in 1989 and was intended to be a part of ''Images and Words'', but at almost 17 minutes, it was deemed too long for studio placement. It had nevertheless been performed live by the band, who continued to revise it in the years leading up to 1995.

The petition was successful, and the group entered [[BearTracks Studios]] in New York in May 1995 to rewrite and record the now 23-minute-long song with Sherinian contributing significantly to the final product. The band released ''[[A Change of Seasons]]'' as an [[Extended play|EP]] along with a collection of cover songs from a live show recorded at Ronnie Scott's Jazz Club in London earlier that year.

After a brief run of small concerts and a short break, the band released a special Christmas CD through their official fan club, consisting of rare live tracks recorded during the band's early years. They continued releasing a new CD each Christmas until 2005.<ref>Nine Christmas CDs were released through Dream Theater's fan club before it was closed down in 2005. See [http://www.dreamtheater.net/dtifc.php?p=annualcd DTIFC on Dream Theater.net]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102141152/http://www.dreamtheater.net/dtifc.php?p=annualcd |date=January 2, 2009 }}</ref>

Meanwhile, there were several changes at East West, and Dream Theater's main contact within the label was fired. As a result, the new team at the company were unaccustomed to the relationship Dream Theater had with former East West personnel, and they pressured them to write an album that was more accessible. In mid-1997, they entered the studio to write their next album. In addition to pressuring the band to adopt a more mainstream sound, East West recruited writer/producer [[Desmond Child]] to work with Petrucci on polishing the lyrics to his song "You or Me". The whole band substantially reworked the song, and it appeared on the album as "You Not Me" with a chorus that bore little resemblance to the original. Child also had a noticeable impact on the album, with a shift towards less complex and more radio-friendly compositions.

The band wrote almost two [[Compact Disc|CD]]s worth of material, including a 20-minute-long follow-up to the ''Images and Words'' song "Metropolis–Part I: The Miracle and the Sleeper". The label, however, did not allow the release of a double album because it felt that a 140-minute record would not be well received by the general public. James LaBrie also felt that the CD should be a single disc.<ref>LaBrie, James. (Summer '97) ''Images & Words No.&nbsp;14'',  pg. 5
</ref> The unused songs were later released in the Ytsejam Records release ''The Falling into Infinity Demos''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ytsejamrecords.com/ProductCart/pc/viewPrd.asp?idcategory=6&idproduct=26 |title=Falling into Infinity Demos |publisher=Ytsejamrecords.com |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

The material that made it onto the album proper was released as ''[[Falling into Infinity]]'', which received a mixed reception from fans who were more familiar with the band's earlier sound. While the album was moderately progressive-sounding, tracks such as "[[Hollow Years]]" and "You Not Me" prompted some to believe it was the dawn of a new, mainstream-sounding Dream Theater. Overall, the album was both a critical and commercial disappointment. Although Portnoy did not speak out publicly at the time, he later revealed in the 2004 DVD commentary for ''[[5 Years in a Livetime]]'', that he had been so discouraged during this period that he had considered disbanding Dream Theater altogether.

During the European leg of the Touring Into Infinity world tour, two shows were recorded for a live album titled ''[[Once in a LIVEtime]]'', in [[France]] and The [[Netherlands]]. The album was released at around the same time as the video ''[[5 Years in a Livetime]]'', which covered the years from Kevin Moore's departure to the ''Falling into Infinity'' promotional tour.

===Derek Sherinian's departure, addition of Jordan Rudess, and ''Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory'' (1999–2000)===
In 1997, [[Magna Carta Records]]' Mike Varney invited Portnoy to assemble a progressive '[[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]]' to work on an album, which would become the first in a long string of side-projects for the members of Dream Theater.<ref>Portnoy, Mike (1998). "Liquid Tension Experiment" [CD Liner Notes]. New York: Magna Carta Records.</ref>  The lineup consisted of Portnoy on drums, Petrucci on guitar, [[Tony Levin]] on bass, and keyboardist Jordan Rudess, who had finished with the Dixie Dregs. The band assumed the name [[Liquid Tension Experiment]], and would act as a medium through which Portnoy and Petrucci could once again court Rudess to join Dream Theater. In 1999, he accepted an offer to become the third full-time Dream Theater keyboardist, replacing Sherinian.<ref name="score so far" />

With yet another new member, Dream Theater entered BearTracks Studio once again to write and record their next album. As a result of an ultimatum from Portnoy, the label gave the band complete creative control. The band began by revisiting the follow-up to "Metropolis–Part I", which had been partially written during the ''Falling into Infinity'' sessions but which had not been completed or used on that album. They decided to expand the 21-minute song into a complete [[concept album]], with a story revolving around themes such as reincarnation, murder and betrayal. To avoid stirring up the fan base, a tight veil of secrecy enveloped the writing and recording process. The only things fans were privy to prior to its release were a track list that had been leaked against the band's wishes, and a release date. In 1999, ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'' was released to high critical acclaim, being lauded as the band's masterpiece, despite only reaching No.&nbsp;73 on the US album chart.<ref name="charts" />

The album was mixed by [[David Bottrill]], but only a few of his mixes made it on the final album. The bulk was remixed by [[Kevin Shirley]], who had produced ''Falling into Infinity''. The rest of the mixes can be heard in the band's official bootleg ''The Making of Scenes from a Memory''.

The subsequent [[Metropolis 2000 (Dream Theater Tour)|Metropolis 2000]] world tour was by far their largest to date, and took over a year to complete. The concerts reflected the theatrical aspect of the album, with the first half of each show comprising the entire ''Scenes From a Memory'' album accompanied by a film showing dramatized portions of the story projected onto a video screen behind the stage. For the last date of the North American leg, at the [[Roseland Ballroom]] in New York City, actors were hired to play characters in the story, and a gospel choir was enlisted to perform in some sections of the performance. The show was filmed and eventually released in early 2001 as the band's first DVD release, ''[[Metropolis 2000: Scenes from New York]]'', which was certified Gold in the US on November 8, 2002.<ref name="riaa.com">{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?content_selector=gold-platinum-searchable-database |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database - August 09, 2014 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref>

Since several songs from the second half of the four-hour show had to be cut from the DVD to save space, the band also released the full show on the live CD ''[[Live Scenes from New York]]''. The original cover depicted one of Dream Theater's early logos (the ''Images and Words''-era burning heart, modeled on the [[Sacred Heart]] of Christ) modified to show an apple (as in "[[Big Apple]]") instead of the heart, and the New York skyline, including the twin towers of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]], in the flame above it. In an unfortunate coincidence, the album was released on the same date as the [[September 11 attacks]]. The album was quickly recalled by the band and was re-released with revised artwork later,<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/12.aspx#213 | title=Mike Portnoy FAQ|website=Mikeportnoy.com }}</ref> although the few copies which were sold with the original artwork have since become rare collector's items.

===''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' (2001–2002)===

Putting the whole ordeal behind them, Dream Theater once again entered BearTracks Studios to record their sixth studio album. Four years after they first petitioned East West to allow them to release a double album, they finally got their chance with ''[[Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence]]''. The first disc consisted of five tracks of 7–13 minutes in length, and the second disc was devoted entirely to the 42-minute title track, which remains to date the longest song Dream Theater has written. Many of the song's melodies and musical themes originated in an instrumental piece, written by Rudess, which would eventually become the song's "Overture". Those themes were then expanded by the rest of the band to form individual chapters in a complete story.<ref name="score so far"/>

''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' was very well received by critics and the press. It was the most publicized of Dream Theater's albums since ''Awake'', debuting on the Billboard charts at No.&nbsp;46<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web| url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=dream theater|chart=all}}| title=Billboard Chart history for Dream Theater }}</ref> and the Billboard Internet charts at No.&nbsp;1.<ref>[http://www.dreamtheater.net/archive_dreamtheater.php?y=2002#billboard DreamTheater.net] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725011754/http://www.dreamtheater.net/archive_dreamtheater.php?y=2002#billboard |date=July 25, 2011 }} reported that ''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'' had reached No.&nbsp;1 on the Billboard Internet Charts.</ref> The subsequent world tour included a select few special "album cover" gigs (see [[#Cover songs|Cover songs]] section, below), in which they played Metallica's ''[[Master of Puppets]]'' and Iron Maiden's ''[[The Number of the Beast (album)|The Number of the Beast]]'' in their entirety.

===''Train of Thought'' (2003–2004)===
In 2003, Dream Theater entered the studio to write and record another album. Unlike ''Scenes from a Memory'', which had been written and recorded simultaneously in the studio, the band took a different approach by setting aside three weeks for writing prior to recording. In the middle of the recording sessions for the album, a special tour with two other progressive metal bands, Queensrÿche and Fates Warning, was undertaken in North America. Referred to in the band's promotional material as the "Escape from the Studio American tour", the tour featured Queensrÿche and Dream Theater as co-headlining acts with Fates Warning performing supporting act duties. As a finale for each concert there was an extended encore in which both Dream Theater and Queensrÿche performed together on stage simultaneously, often playing cover songs.

At the completion of the tour, Dream Theater returned to the studio to finish the recording of their seventh album, ''[[Train of Thought (Dream Theater album)|Train of Thought]]''. In contrast to the extended songs of their previous album, the band aimed to write a more song-oriented album, inspired in part by covering the ''Master of Puppets'' and ''Number of the Beast'' albums on their previous concert tour.<ref>Mike Portnoy (2007) "In Constant Motion" Instructional [[DVD]], ''Train of Thought'' album analysis.</ref> Although the album was a critical success, its more straightforward metal sound alienated many of the band's existing fans, who had been attracted by the band's roots in [[progressive rock]].<ref name="score so far" /> During this time they also re-released their first two live videos for the first time on DVD, titled "Images and Words: Live in Tokyo/5 Years in a Livetime" on June 29, 2004, through Rhino Records. This release was certified Platinum on March 22, 2006.<ref name="riaa.com"/>

Another world tour followed, named [[Train of Thought Tour]]. A modest North American tour was completed by the two bands, which Dream Theater supported Yes, a band which had been a major influence on their own musical style. After which Dream Theater continued to tour the world with their so-called "An Evening With Dream Theater" shows. The latter were captured in another live CD/DVD release, recorded at the famous [[Nippon Budokan Hall]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan on their [[Train of Thought Tour]]. ''[[Live at Budokan (Dream Theater)|Live at Budokan]]'' was released on October 5, 2004, and was certified Platinum in the US on January 26, 2005.<ref name="riaa.com"/>

===''Octavarium'' (2005–2006)===

After their ''Train of Thought'' promotional tour, Dream Theater entered [[the Hit Factory]] studios in NYC to record their eighth album. They would in fact become the final group to use the famous studio, which closed on April 1, 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digitalprosound.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=45690|last=Moldstad|first=Frank|publisher=Digital Pro Sound|title=New York's Hit Factory Gets a New Identity|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220093309/http://digitalprosound.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=45690|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

''[[Octavarium (album)|Octavarium]]'' was released on June 7, 2005, and took the band's sound in yet another new direction. Its eight songs included a continuation of Portnoy's "[[AA Suite|Twelve-step]]" saga ("The Root of All Evil", steps 6–7 in the 12-step plan), as well as the [[Octavarium (song)|title track]], a musically versatile 24 minute epic rivaling "A Change of Seasons". ''Octavarium'' received mixed reviews from fans and has been the subject of spirited debate. ''Octavarium'' was the last album under their seven-album deal with [[Elektra Records]], which had inherited the contract upon its absorption of [[EastWest Records]].

Dream Theater started the [[Octavarium Tour]] extensively throughout 2005 and 2006 to celebrate their 20th Anniversary as a band, including a headlining spot on [[Gigantour]] alongside [[Megadeth]] and put together by frontman [[Dave Mustaine]], also featuring [[Fear Factory]], [[Nevermore]] and [[Symphony X]]. During a show on August 2, 2005 in Dallas, the band paid tribute to [[Pantera]]'s late guitarist [[Dimebag Darrell]] by performing the song "[[Cemetery Gates]]" as an encore. In addition was the unexpected appearance of fellow musicians [[Russell Allen]] (Symphony X vocalist), [[Burton C. Bell]] (Fear Factory vocalist) and [[Dave Mustaine]] (Megadeth vocalist/guitarist), who joined the band on stage to perform parts of the song.

Dream Theater later departed from Gigantour 2005 a few dates before it ended and continued on with their own series of concerts, several of which were recorded and released for the band's fanclubs. The 20th anniversary tour concluded with a show at [[Radio City Music Hall]] in New York City on April 1, 2006. Though the show had minimal promotion, it was sold out days after tickets were made available. This show, which was recorded for a CD/DVD called ''[[Score (Dream Theater album)|Score]]'' released on August 29, 2006 through [[Rhino Records]], featured songs from the band's entire history, as well a second half accompanied by a full symphony orchestra (the "Octavarium Orchestra"). This release was the band's third Live DVD release to be certified Platinum in the US on October 11, 2006.<ref name="riaa.com"/>

===''Systematic Chaos'' and ''Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)'' (2006–2008)===
[[File:Dream Theater 2326994259 c689a5f104 o.jpg|thumb|Dream Theater playing live March 8, 2008]]
For the first time in their career, the band decided to take the summer off after their show at Radio City Music Hall. In September 2006, Dream Theater entered Avatar Studios to record their follow-up to ''[[Octavarium]]'' with legendary studio engineer [[Paul Northfield]]. Dream Theater's ninth studio album, ''[[Systematic Chaos]]'', was released on June 5, 2007. The record marked their first with new label [[Roadrunner Records]], which in 2010 would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the band's previous label [[Atlantic Records]]. Roadrunner implemented increased promotion for the album and ''Systematic Chaos'' duly reached number 19 on the ''Billboard'' 200. It also oversaw the release of a video for "[[Constant Motion]]" on July 14, the band's first music video since Hollow Years in 1997. The album was bookended by the two parts of "In the Presence of Enemies", written and conceived as a single piece but split into two halves for the purposes of the album. The other six tracks included the most recent part of Portnoy's continuing [[AA Saga]] with the song "[[Repentance (song)|Repentance]]".

In the same year, the first version of Rich Wilson's ''[[Lifting Shadows]]'', an authorized history of the band's first twenty years, was released.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamtheaterbook.com/ |title=Lifting Shadows – The Authorised Story Of Dream Theater |publisher=Dreamtheaterbook.com |access-date=January 2, 2009}}</ref>

The 2007–08 [[Chaos in Motion Tour]] started off in Italy. Dream Theater played in the [[Gods of Metal]] concert on June 3, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godsofmetal.it/ |title=Gods of Metal official website |publisher=Godsofmetal.it |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719202238/http://www.godsofmetal.it/ |archive-date=July 19, 2011 }}</ref> as well as various other European festivals including the Netherlands' Fields of Rock Festival, UK's [[Download Festival]], the French festival [[Hellfest Summer Open Air]] alongside [[Megadeth]], [[Korn]], [[Mastodon (band)|Mastodon]] and [[Slayer]]. The North American leg of the tour began on July 24 in [[San Diego]], [[California]] and wrapped up on August 26 in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. They played with opening acts [[Redemption (band)|Redemption]] and [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]]. The Chaos In Motion Tour continued for the rest of the year and into 2008, playing shows in [[Asia]], [[South America]] and, for the first time, [[Australia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=81636 |title=Opeth To Support Dream Theater In North America – Blabbermouth.net |website=Roadrunnerrecords.com |date=September 27, 2007 |access-date=January 30, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410012728/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=81636 |archive-date=April 10, 2009 }}</ref>

On April 1, 2008, a two-disc [[compilation album]] titled ''[[Greatest Hit (...and 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs)]]'' was released by the band. The title jokingly references the song "[[Pull Me Under]]", the band's only significant [[Hit single|radio hit]]. It also includes three song re-mixes from their second album, ''Images and Words'', five edited versions of previously released songs, and a track from a single [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Unlike most [[greatest hits]] compilations, Dream Theater was actively involved with the album, coming up with the track listing that they felt best represented their musical careers.

After the release of ''Greatest Hit'', drummer Mike Portnoy organized a new tour called [[Progressive Nation 2008]]. Unlike previous Dream Theater tours, performances were held in cities that they had not visited before in the past (such as [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], Canada) or cities they had not played in for several years. This tour also marked the first time, since the release of Images and Words, where the group performed in small venues and performance halls.

In September 2008, the band released a DVD set called ''[[Chaos in Motion 2007–2008]]'', featuring songs recorded at several shows during the ''Chaos in Motion'' tour.

===''Black Clouds & Silver Linings'' (2008–2010)===
On October 7, 2008, Dream Theater returned to Avatar Studios to begin work on their tenth album, resuming their relationship with [[Paul Northfield]] to engineer and mix the record. The album, titled ''[[Black Clouds & Silver Linings]]'', was released on June 23, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/forum/m2268614.aspx |title=Dream Theater – Black Clouds & Silver Linings |publisher=Mikeportnoy.com |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> In addition to the standard CD, the album was made available on vinyl LP, as well as a 3-disc Special Edition CD that includes the full album, a CD of instrumental mixes of the album and a CD of six cover songs from artists such as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]]. On July 1, 2009, the album debuted at No.&nbsp;6 on Billboard's Top 200 album chart, with first week sales totalling 40,285, making their highest entry on the chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/1124/16276/Holy-Shit-Dream-Theater-debuts-at-6-on-Billboard-Top-200.html |title=Dream Theater debut's at 6 on Billboard Top 200, The Gauntlet |publisher=Thegauntlet.com |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> The album featured "The Shattered Fortress", the last in Mike Portnoy's [[Twelve-step Suite|series of songs]] about his 12-step recovery from alcoholism, as well as the song "The Best of Times", described by Portnoy as "a real heavy personal subject about my dad who passed away during the making of the album ... He was battling cancer throughout its making."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/dream-theater%e2%80%99s-mike-portnoy-pens-tribute-to-late-father/ |title=Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy Pens Tribute To Late Father |publisher=Metalhammer.co.uk |date=May 1, 2009 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629081851/http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/dream-theater%E2%80%99s-mike-portnoy-pens-tribute-to-late-father/ |archive-date=June 29, 2011 }}</ref>

The band also embarked on a second Progressive Nation tour, including the tour's first performances in Europe. [[Opeth]], [[Unexpect]] and [[Bigelf]] supported Dream Theater in Europe, while [[Zappa Plays Zappa]], [[Pain Of Salvation]], and [[Beardfish (band)|Beardfish]] were slated to perform on the North American leg. However, Pain of Salvation and Beardfish were unable to tour with Dream Theater and Zappa Plays Zappa because of financial troubles within their respective record labels. The two new bands that filled the vacated slots for the [[Progressive Nation 2009]] tour in North America were [[Bigelf]] and [[Scale the Summit]] with Bigelf performing on both European and North American legs.

After the Progressive Nation Tour, Dream Theater re-entered the studio to write and record a brand new instrumental track for inclusion on the ''[[God of War III]]'' soundtrack EP ''[[God of War: Blood & Metal]]''. The track, titled "Raw Dog" (''God (of) War'' reversed), marked the first time that the band has written and recorded an exclusive track for an outside project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/forum/m2443312.aspx|last= Portnoy|first=Mike|title=MP's Forecast for 2010|publisher=mikeportnoy.com}}</ref>  "Raw Dog" includes the first ever commercially recorded [[harpejji]] track, performed by [[Jordan Rudess]], as well as Dream Theater's final recorded performance with [[Mike Portnoy]] on drums. In December 2009, during their ''[[Black Clouds & Silver Linings]]'' tour whilst visiting Australia, Dream Theater appeared with one support act, Pain of Salvation.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Bredius |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php#dtnzaustralia |title=tour dates for Australia, December 1–12, 2009 |publisher=Dreamtheater.net |date=June 14, 2011 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150258/http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php |archive-date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref> In March 2010, they toured South America with [[Bigelf]].

After Portnoy left Dream Theater, relationships between him and his former bandmates became strained. In February 2011, Portnoy complained that no one from the band was returning his calls and e-mails.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mike Portnoy: Dream Theater Members Are Refusing To Answer My E-Mails And Calls – Feb. 25, 2011|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=154516|work=Blabbermouth|access-date=July 8, 2012}}</ref> However, later Portnoy commented that both Petrucci and Rudess were the only members that stayed in touch with him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tntradiorock.com/mike-portnoy-shattered-fortress-be-prog-my-friend-2017-entrevista-tnt/|title=Mike Portnoy - Shattered Fortress - Be Prog My Friend 2017|last=TNT Radio Rock|date=April 23, 2017|website=TNTRadioRock.com|access-date=January 9, 2020}}</ref> Tensions became especially high when Portnoy called James LaBrie "disrespectful" for comments LaBrie made during an interview,<ref>{{cite web|last=Harris |first=Chris |title=Mike Portnoy Fires Back At James LaBrie |url=http://gunshyassassin.com/news/mike-portnoy-fires-back-at-james-labrie/ |publisher=Gun Shy Assassin |access-date=July 8, 2012 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313154614/http://gunshyassassin.com/news/mike-portnoy-fires-back-at-james-labrie/ |archive-date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> stating that Dream Theater were "not sad at all" that Portnoy was no longer a band member.

A little more than a month after Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater began auditioning for a new drummer in New York City. The drummers who auditioned were [[Mike Mangini]], [[Derek Roddy]], [[Thomas Lang]], [[Virgil Donati]], [[Marco Minnemann]], [[Aquiles Priester]], and [[Peter Wildoer]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Dream Theater: 'The Spirit Carries On' Drummer-Search Web Series To Be Released On DVD - Apr. 28, 2011|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=157437|work=Blabbermouth|access-date=July 6, 2012}}</ref> [[Fates Warning]] drummer [[Bobby Jarzombek]] was also invited to audition, but had to turn down the offer due to scheduling conflicts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bobby-jarzombek-why-i-turned-down-dream-theater-drummer-audition/|title=BOBBY JARZOMBEK: Why I Turned Down DREAM THEATER Drummer Audition|last=Blabbermouth|date=November 16, 2013|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=May 12, 2019}}</ref> The candidates were notified whether they had been chosen on November 5;<ref>{{cite web|last=Wildoer|first=Peter|title=Re: An Exclusive Look into The Band's Search for a New Drummer|url=http://www.dreamtheaterforums.org/boards/index.php?topic=22228.msg865423#msg865423|publisher=Dream Theater Forums|access-date=July 6, 2012}}</ref> however, the results of the audition were not made public until April 2011 via a three-part [[YouTube]] documentary series called ''The Spirit Carries On''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Dream Theater – The Spirit Carries On Episode 3|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2QHMQjH17aw |publisher=YouTube|access-date=July 6, 2012}}</ref>  In the last episode of the series, it was revealed that Mangini was the drummer selected.

On January 6, 2014, John Petrucci said that Dream Theater were already "planting seeds for album No. 13". He commented: "There are some song ideas and little things like that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One of the great things about this career is that you have the opportunity every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently? How can we make this better? Where can we go from here?' Every album has a story, and to constantly have a fresh opportunity to do it is really satisfying."<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Gary|last=Graff |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5862286/dream-theater-planting-seeds-for-album-no-13 |title=Dream Theater Planting Seeds for Album No. 13 |magazine=Billboard |date=January 6, 2014 |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

In 2017, Dream Theater went on another tour, titled Images, Words & Beyond, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of ''Images and Words''. Each night they performed the album in its entirety, as well as "A Change of Seasons", which was originally written during the ''Images and Words'' sessions, and other selections from their catalogue.

==Live performances==
[[File:Dream Theater Live in Argentina 03-03-08.jpg|250px|thumb|left|Rudess and Petrucci dueling in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina (2008)]]

Throughout their career, Dream Theater's live shows have gradually become bigger, longer and more diverse. Prior to Portnoy's departure, Dream Theater "rotated" its set lists to ensure that fans who attended multiple shows in the same area would not see too many (or any) songs repeated.  Portnoy, who constructed the set lists, would take into account the set list from the last time the band was in a particular city for the benefit of fans who saw the band on successive tours.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earplugsrequired.com/bands/dreamtheater/dreamtheatermike.html |title=Earplugs Required |publisher=Earplugs Required |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

The band's full world tours, since ''Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence'', have predominantly been "Evening with..." tours, in which the band performs for at least three hours without an opening act. Until 2012, such tours did not contain an intermission, but every tour since the Along for the Ride Tour in 2013-2014 has. The show that was recorded for ''Live Scenes From New York'' was nearly four hours in length, and resulted in Portnoy almost being hospitalized after acquiring severe food poisoning from the food he ate before the show.<ref>See the ''Metropolis 2000: Scenes From New York'' DVD</ref><ref>Hansen, Scott & Portnoy, Mike. "[http://mikeportnoy.com/aboutmike/faq/answers/12.aspx#74 What’s this I hear about Mike being really sick after the Roseland (DVD) show?

There is also a significant amount of humor, casualness, and improvisation attached to Dream Theater's concert. For example, the performance of "A Change of Seasons" on ''Live Scenes from New York'' features changes to a series of instrumental breaks, with Myung playing a baseball organ melody, Petrucci playing the opening theme to ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and Rudess playing the [[ragtime]] section of "When the Water Breaks" from ''[[Liquid Tension Experiment 2]]'' (the latter is also heard on the album ''Live at Budokan''). Several songs included on ''Once in a LIVETime'' include snippets of others' pieces, such as [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]'s "Free Bird" and [[Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s "Flight of the Bumblebee." Other quotations include "Mary Had a Little Lamb" during "Endless Sacrifice" on the Gigantour, a calliope-inspired break between verses of "Under a Glass Moon", a quote of "[[Don't Cry for Me, Argentina]]"'s main melody played by Petrucci while performing the intro solo of "Through Her Eyes" in [[Buenos Aires]], the Turkish March at a concert in [[Istanbul]], and the opening riff of [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s "[[A Passage to Bangkok]]" at a show in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]. On the "20th Anniversary World Tour", Rudess has even thrown in a short "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" theme in a break during "Endless Sacrifice," and during a concert in Israel he started a spontaneous "[[Hava Nagila]]", with the rest of the band later joining in. During the band's 2017 tour, a snippet of [[Metallica]]'s "[[Enter Sandman]]" was played during Dream Theater's own song "As I Am".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rollingstoneindia.com/concert-review-dream-theater-epic-near-jinxed-india-debut/|title=Concert Review: Dream Theater's Epic, Near-Jinxed India Debut -|date=October 9, 2017}}</ref>

Perhaps the best example of Dream Theater's unpredictable concert structure came during Derek Sherinian's time with the band. At selected shows the band members all swapped instruments and performed an encore as the fictitious band dubbed [[Nightmare Cinema (parody rock band)|Nightmare Cinema]]. They usually performed a cover of [[Deep Purple]]'s "Perfect Strangers," and, on one occasion, [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s "Suicide Solution," At some shows, Sherinian, Petrucci and Portnoy would take the stage together under the name "Nicky Lemons and the Migraine Brothers." Sherinian, wearing a feather boa and novelty sunglasses, would perform a pop-punk song titled "I Don't Like You" with Petrucci and Portnoy backing. During the Chaos in Motion tour, in several concerts before "Trial of Tears," Portnoy and Petrucci would change positions.

In the ''Score'' and ''Chaos in Motion'' DVDs, an animation has accompanied certain parts of the songs, showing the band playing along to the music as cartoon characters. On the Score DVD, during the song [[Octavarium (song)|Octavarium]], the band is seen performing in an octagonal shaped maze.

===Shows and concerts===
Dream Theater played and recorded a live performance at the [[Nippon Budokan Hall]] on April 26, 2004. It was later released as ''[[Live at Budokan (Dream Theater album)|Live at Budokan]]'' on October 5, 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Dream_Theater/Live_at_Budokan/53808/ |title=Dream Theater – Live at Budokan – Reviews – Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=The Metal Archives |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

Dream Theater's largest audience as a headlining act was 20,000 in [[Santiago, Chile]] on December 6, 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://voicesuk.net/news.php |title=News |publisher=Voices UK |access-date=January 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160205152837/http://voicesuk.net/news.php |archive-date=February 5, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  The show was released on DVD through Portnoy's YtseJam Records.

In 2007, after their show in Salt Lake City on July 30, Governor [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.]] signed a proclamation officially marking July 30, 2007 as ''Dream Theater Day'' in the state of Utah.

In 2008 Dream Theater started the Progressive Nation 2008 tour, along with [[Opeth]], [[Between the Buried and Me]], and [[3 (American band)|3]]. The tour is the brainchild of Mike Portnoy, who stated, "I've been wanting to assemble a package tour like this for many years now. With all of the festivals and package tours that go through America, I've been talking with our manager and agent for over 10 years now about doing something that focuses on the more progressive, musician-oriented side of hard rock and metal. I decided it was time to stop talking the talk, lace up and finally walk the walk."<ref>{{Cite news|title=Progressive Nation 2008 - Press Release |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php#prognation |work=dreamtheater.net |publisher=Dream Theater |date=November 5, 2007 |access-date=May 11, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510152306/http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php |archive-date=May 10, 2008 }}</ref>

On February 13, 2009, Dream Theater announced the official line up for their Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour was originally set to feature bands including Swedish bands [[Beardfish (band)|Beardfish]] and [[Pain of Salvation]], as well as [[Zappa plays Zappa]]. On June 22, 2009, Mike Portnoy announced that Pain of Salvation and Beardfish would not be touring the North American leg of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour because of record label complications. In the same announcement, Portnoy stated that the bands [[Scale the Summit]] and [[Bigelf]] would replace Pain of Salvation and Beardfish on the tour.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Bredius |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php#pnlineup |title=Progressive Nation 2009 North American Tour - Lineup Change |publisher=Dreamtheater.net |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150250/http://www.dreamtheater.net/news_dreamtheater.php |archive-date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref> This lineup change has put [[Bigelf]] on both the North American and European legs of the Progressive Nation 2009 tour. The tour's North American leg ran throughout July and August 2009. On March 26, 2009 it was announced that Dream Theater would take the Progressive Nation tour to Europe for the first time alongside Opeth, [[Bigelf]] and [[Unexpect]]. The tour ran throughout September and October 2009.<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark|last=Bredius |url=http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php |title=Progressive Nation Tour Dates |publisher=Dreamtheater.net |date=June 14, 2011 |access-date=July 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716150258/http://www.dreamtheater.net/tourdates.php |archive-date=July 16, 2011 }}</ref>

In June/July 2010 Dream Theater were the opening band for Iron Maiden during the first leg of their [[The Final Frontier World Tour|Final Frontier Tour]] which included [[Madison Square Garden]] as one of the many venues.  On December 7, 2010, Dream Theater announced on their website that they would be headlining the High Voltage Festival alongside Judas Priest in 2011. In July 2011 they started A Dramatic Tour of Events to promote ''[[A Dramatic Turn of Events]]''. In January 2014, they started the Along for the Ride Tour to promote their [[Dream Theater (album)|self-titled album]]. On December 13, 2016, Dream Theater confirmed 5 UK tour dates for their Images, Words & Beyond 25th Anniversary Tour, starting in Birmingham on April 18, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gettothefront.co.uk/2016/12/dream-theater-confirm-uk-dates-25th-anniversary-tour-tickets/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221064453/http://www.gettothefront.co.uk/2016/12/dream-theater-confirm-uk-dates-25th-anniversary-tour-tickets/ |archive-date=December 21, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Logo and imagery==
[[File:Majesty (old name of Dream Theater) (logo).svg|thumb|right|upright|Dream Theater wordmark and "Majesty" symbol]]
Despite the band being forced to change their name, Dream Theater adopted a custom [[logo]] (known as the ''Majesty symbol'') and [[Wordmark (graphic identity)|wordmark]] which has appeared on the vast majority of their promotional material and on the front cover of every Dream Theater studio album. The Majesty symbol is derived from [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]' mark,<ref>The mark used by [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], is available on [http://www.dreamtheater.net/pics/marysymb.jpg DreamTheater.net]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725012406/http://www.dreamtheater.net/pics/marysymb.jpg |date=July 25, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marie-stuart.co.uk/images/sun%20embroidery.jpg |title=An embroidery showing the Mary, Queen of Scots, symbol in use |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref> which was re-worked by [[Charlie Dominici]] for use on the album artwork for ''[[When Dream and Day Unite]]''.<ref name="What is the 'symbol' DT use">{{cite web|url=http://faq.dtnorway.com/question?questionid=29 |title=What is the 'symbol' DT use? |website=Faq.dtnorway.com |date=November 7, 2003 |access-date=January 30, 2016}}</ref>

In September 2010, a fan of Dream Theater discovered that all of the letters of "DOMINICI" fit together perfectly into the Majesty symbol.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfdRfcCe_NM |title=What does Dream Theater, Majesty and Dominici have in common? |publisher=YouTube |date=September 13, 2010 |access-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref> When Charlie discovered this, he laughed and mentioned that "it only took them 25 years to figure out the 'Dominici Code!'"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dominici.com/forum/index.php?topic=421.0 |title=Someone finally figured out the "Dominici Code!" |publisher=DOMINICI.com Forum |date=September 28, 2010 |access-date=September 28, 2010}}</ref> This has earlier also been discovered as shown on the comment section of DTFAQ<ref name="What is the 'symbol' DT use"/> and in the DTNorway Podcast Episode 2 from 2008, with Charlie Dominici.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dtnorway.com/podcast.xml |title=Echo's Hill Podcast |publisher=DTNorway |access-date=July 18, 2011}}</ref>

==Musical style==
[[AllMusic]]'s [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] described Dream Theater's music as a "dense blend of [[progressive rock]] and post-[[Van Halen|Halen]] [[heavy metal music|metal]]".
The band is well noted for being one of the early progenitors of the [[progressive metal]] genre,<ref name= allmusic>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/progressive-metal-ma0000002797|title=Progressive Metal|work=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=December 12, 2010}}</ref> and they are considered a member of the so-called "big three" of the genre, along with [[Queensrÿche]] and [[Fates Warning]].<ref name="progarchives"/> The original members, Mike Portnoy, John Petrucci and John Myung, have strong influences from progressive rock bands such as [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and [[Pink Floyd]], heavy metal bands such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Judas Priest]], various [[speed metal]] bands, and even the [[glam metal]] of the day.<ref name=rhap>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhapsody.com/dream-theater|last=York|first=Will|work=[[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody]]|title=Dream Theater|access-date=December 12, 2010}}</ref> This synthesis created a unique metal that was not traditional of the day: it had distorted guitars and fast riffing, but the music focused more on technical proficiency and precise execution than on heavy metal riffs. The band's music has focused on three main elements: metal, melody, and progressive roots.<ref name= utube>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vlbhILPW80A|title=Dream Theater – Interview – part 1|last=Portnoy|first=Mike|work=TheCrookedStep.com|access-date=December 12, 2010}}</ref>
In the liner notes for the 2008 ''Greatest Hit'' compilation, Mike Portnoy cited artists such as [[Peter Gabriel]], [[U2]], and [[Journey (band)|Journey]] as inspirations for Dream Theater's softer songs.<ref>Greatest Hit (...And 21 Other Pretty Cool Songs) booklet liner notes.</ref>
Dream Theater's music has also been described as [[art rock]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Legends of Rock Guitar: The Essential Reference of Rock's Greatest Guitarists|author=Pete Prown, Harvey P. Newquist|quote="Dream Theater carved a niche for themselves as an art-rock band with few peers"}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Disco, Punk, New Wave, Heavy Metal, and More: Music in the 1970s and 1980s|author=Britannica Educational Publishing|quote="Dream Theater also explored a number of stylistic features earlier associated with art rock."}}</ref>

Dream Theater's 2003 album ''[[Train of Thought (Dream Theater album)|Train of Thought]]'' showcased a heavier sound.<ref>{{cite web|first=Thom|last=Jurek |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/train-of-thought-mw0000319323 |title=Train of Thought – Dream Theater &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=November 14, 2003 |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> This decision was inspired by the positive feedback received from their previous heavier songs on stage.<ref>As discussed by John Petrucci in the 20th Anniversary Documentary "The Score So Far", found on the [[Score (Dream Theater album)|Score]] DVD</ref> 
1999's ''[[Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory]]'' was praised for its display of old-fashioned progressive rock,<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/metropolis-pt-2-scenes-from-a-memory-mw0000251583 |title=Metropolis, Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory – Dream Theater &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards |website=[[AllMusic]] |date=October 26, 1999 |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> and was influenced by classic conceptual rock records such as [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', [[Pink Floyd]]'s ''[[The Wall]]'' and ''[[The Final Cut (album)|The Final Cut]]'', [[the Who]]'s ''[[Tommy (The Who album)|Tommy]]'', and [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]]'s ''[[The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muBfZoIsQoA |title=Dream Theater – Making of Scenes From A Memory |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=August 25, 2006 |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref>

Dream Theater's music usually borrows elements from other musical styles including [[Progressive rock|symphonic rock]], [[symphonic metal]], {{nowrap|[[arena rock]]}}, [[soft rock]],<ref>{{cite news|last=Lewis |first=Catherine P. |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/goingoutguide/music/dream-theater-album-review/2014/03/27/9bea0904-b04f-11e3-95e8-39bef8e9a48b_story.html |title=Dream Theater album review |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref> and [[classical music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/john-petrucci-2013-interview/ |title=John Petrucci Of Dream Theater Interview |publisher=Ultimateclassicrock.com |date=October 26, 2013 |access-date=August 9, 2014}}</ref>
