==History==
Peter Helmis, Joe Reinhart, and Colin Mahony met in high school and formed the precursor to Algernon Cadwallader, ''Halfway to Holland,'' with their friend TJ DeBlois (drummer of metalcore band ''A Life Once Lost''.) The lineup was Helmis and Reinhart on guitars with Mahony on bass and Helmis on vocals as well. ''Halfway to Holland'' differed from Algernon Cadwallader, with a heavier driving sound, more reverb on guitars and chords rounding out rhythm as opposed to the clean math rock riffs Algernon Cadwallader has become known for. While the band was short lived, it continues to have a cult following to this day. Helmis went on to various solo and duo acts, while Mahony and Reinhart formed another band, ''Like Lions'', with fellow school mates. Reinhart and Mahony's collaboration with ''Like Lions'' was short lived due to musical differences, and subsequently reached out to Helmis and friend Nick Tazza (from ''Ape Up''!) to form Algernon Cadwallader in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-11-13|title=Emo Revival Heroes Algernon Cadwallader Are Back (In Print)|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2020853/emo-revival-heroes-algernon-cadwallader-are-back-in-print/interviews/qa/|access-date=2021-07-28|website=Stereogum|language=en}}</ref>

The line up changed with Helmis still on vocals but switching bass with Mahony, now on rhythm guitar. A five song "Demo" was released in 2006, with heavy influence the math-rock Midwest emo genre, than their previous project. Lyrical content however, was a more upbeat, happy musings of personal experiences or day to day life, than the darker, more somber tones the emo genre had been known for. They released their first full-length album in 2008 titled ''Some Kind Of Cadwallader''. Up until this point, shows mainly consistented of Philadelphia basements and house shows, with small tours to neighboring cities. Tazza left the band in early 2008 and was replaced with Matt "Tank" Bergman (US Funk Team.) Mahony left the band later in 2008 and Algernon became a trio, choosing not to replace Mahony.

The trio toured throughout America and a European leg. In 2009 the released ''Fun'' EP followed by their second full-length album in 2011 titled ''Parrot Flies''. In 2012 the band had been "laid to rest."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Algernaan (Your Daily Bread)|url=http://algernoncadwallader.blogspot.com/|access-date=2021-07-28|language=en}}</ref>
