'''Michael Lawrence Tyler''' (born September 22, 1970), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Mystikal''', is an American rapper and actor from [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]].

==Early life and education==
Michael's family moved to [[New Orleans]] when he was young. His father, who ran a small neighborhood store, died when Michael was seven. He attended [[Cohen High School]] and afterward joined the [[United States Army]] as a [[combat engineer]]. As an aspiring rapper, he opened for [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[Doug E. Fresh]] at an outdoor concert at the Treme Center. Leroy "Precise" Edwards, the house producer for [[Big Boy Records]], was in the audience, and granted him a contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.offbeat.com/articles/the-mind-of-mystikal/|title=The Mind of Mystikal - OffBeat Magazine|access-date=29 October 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
===1994–95: Early career===
Mystikal's debut album, ''Mystikal'', was released on New Orleans-based [[independent record label]] [[Big Boy Records]] in 1994. The album was one of Big Boy's most successful and gained major success for Mystikal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveoldschoolmusic.com/kkgallery/damion-neville-charged-murdering-rapper-mystikals-sister/|title=DAMION NEVILLE WAS CHARGED WITH MURDERING RAPPER, MYSTIKAL'S, SISTER|access-date=29 October 2016}}</ref> In 1995, he found himself involved in conflict with fellow New Orleans [[rappers]] signed to rival [[Cash Money Records]], including U.N.L.V., [[Lil Wayne]] & [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]]. They dissed him on tracks like "Drag 'Em in Tha River" by U.N.L.V. and "Fuck Big Boy" by The B.G.'z. He struck back with the disses "Beware" and "Here I Go" which were on his second album, ''[[Mind of Mystikal]]''. Mystikal's sister, Michelle Tyler, sang the chorus on "Not That Nigga" and her fate became a major influence on Mystikal's music after her murder in September 1994.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://www.nola.com/music/2010/08/new_orleans_rapper_mystikal_on.html|title=New Orleans rapper Mystikal on the comeback trail after six years in prison|first=Keith|last=Spera|date=August 8, 2010|website=nola.com|location=Louisiana|access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref> The songs "Dedicated To Michelle Tyler", "Murder" (both on ''[[Mind of Mystikal]]''), "Murder 2", "Shine" (both on ''[[Unpredictable (Mystikal album)|Unpredictable]]'') and "Murder III" (on ''[[Let's Get Ready]]'') refer to her murder. It wasn't long after their beef that Mystikal and Lil Wayne decided to squash it and become collaborators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lilwaynehq.com/beefs/mystikal/|title=Lil Wayne & Mystikal Beef|access-date=29 October 2016}}</ref>

===1995–2000: ''Mind of Mystikal'' and stint with Big Boy Records===
Mystikal signed to [[Big Boy Records;Jive Records]] and released ''[[Mind of Mystikal]]'' in 1995. He signed to [[No Limit Records]] in 1996 and released ''[[Unpredictable (Mystikal album)|Unpredictable]]'' in November 1997. He appeared on many of the No Limit albums released from 1997 through a chunk of 2000. He also collaborated with Mariah Carey on her ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]'' album on the track 'Did I Do That'. In late 1998, he released ''[[Ghetto Fabulous (album)|Ghetto Fabulous]]''. That was his last album with the label, and he left later in 2000 to go on his own.

===2000–04: ''Let's Get Ready'', ''Tarantula'' and prison===
In 1999, he had begun recording his fourth album before leaving No Limit. ''[[Let's Get Ready]]'' was released in 2000 and contained "[[Danger (Been So Long)]]", which featured rising pop star [[Nivea Hamilton|Nivea]], and was the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] [[List of number-one R&B hits (United States)|number-one single]] in June 2001. ''Let's Get Ready'' debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], making it Mystikal's only chart-topping album to date. The album also featured the popular, [[The Neptunes|Neptunes]]-produced hit "[[Shake Ya Ass]]". The song attained cult-like popularity and can be heard in the background of numerous movies.

Mystikal's most recent solo release was the 2001 album ''[[Tarantula (Mystikal album)|Tarantula]]'', which contained the hit single, "[[Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against the Wall)|Bouncin' Back (Bumpin' Me Against The Wall)]]". Though it presented Mystikal's typical and funky flow style, which had the distinction of drawing comparison to legendary R&B soul screamers [[Little Richard]] and [[James Brown]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Mystikal |title=Mystikal Discography at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=1970-09-22 |access-date=2012-12-19}}</ref> the song also saw a blending of [[jazz]] and [[Swing (genre)|swing]] elements with [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]].

==Personal life==
Mystikal's sister Michelle Tyler was murdered in September 1994 by her boyfriend.<ref name="auto"/>

===Sexual battery conviction and other legal issues===
On June 26, 2003, Mystikal pleaded guilty to [[sexual battery]] and [[extortion]]. On January 15, 2004, Mystikal was sentenced to six years in state prison after pleading guilty to sexually assaulting his hairstylist. The rapper and two bodyguards forced the woman to perform oral sex, and accused her of stealing $80,000 in checks. As part of a plea bargain, all three pleaded guilty. Mystikal initially claimed that the incident was consensual, but a videotape of the incident was later found at his home shortly after the charges were made. Negotiations during the trial held the videotape from being entered as evidence and Mystikal agreed to the plea bargain offered by the prosecution, avoiding the mandatory life sentence for sexual battery in Louisiana and expecting to receive probation. However, the case took a twist when the judge viewed the videotape at the sentencing, took into account Mystikal's two prior arrests (for drug and gun possession), and had him remanded into custody to begin serving a six-year sentence immediately. Mystikal's bodyguards, Leland Ellis and Vercy Carter, also pleaded guilty to sexual battery.<ref name="Rapper Mystikal sentenced to six years"/>

In August 2005, while incarcerated on the state sexual battery and extortion charges, Mystikal was charged federally with two [[misdemeanor]] counts of failing to file tax returns for 1998 and 1999. On January 12, 2006, he was convicted in [[United States district court|federal court]] of the tax offenses, but was allowed to serve the one-year federal sentence concurrent with his six-year state sentence.<ref name="AHH Stray News: 50 Cent Sued, Mystikal, Ms Dynamite, Dilated Peoples">{{cite web | url = http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=5274 | access-date = 2006-09-23 | author = Nolan Strong |author2=Christine S.
