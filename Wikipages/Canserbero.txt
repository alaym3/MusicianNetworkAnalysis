==Death==
Canserbero died in an apparent [[murder–suicide]] on January 20, 2015, in Maracay. 

On January 20, 2015, Canserbero was found dead in front of his apartment.  The artist is supposed to be found from the tenth floor of the Camino Real building in the Andrés Bello urbanization in Maracay.  [7] Initially, some of his close friends maintained that the artist stayed in the apartment of Carlos Molnar, a friend and co-worker, since he was suffering from schizophrenia.  Molnar was killed that same day by stabbing.  On the other hand, the Ombudsman of Venezuela, Tarek William Saab, in March of the same year, reopened the case, since there are other additional details that straighten some hypotheses of the "witnesses".  The first hypothesis is based on the fact that the kitchen window was made of romanillas and all the glasses were previously removed, which causes intrigue, given the "presumed" psychotic state in which Canserbero was used at the time of launching.  [Quote required] "Having taken the romanillas out of the window indicates method, not despair," says the defender, who relies on the sisters' testimony to indicate that the romanillas were not at the time of Canserbero's fall, "but someone  put them back later, "he said.

While suffering from depression (although family members said that he was not suffering from any mental illness), he was asked by Carlos Molnar, bassist for Zion TPL, to stay with him.<ref>{{cite news|title=Muere el cantante de rap venezolano Canserbero|url=http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/entretenimiento/noticias/muere-cantante-rap-venezolano-canserbero|accessdate=January 21, 2015|work=[[El País]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924051121/http://www.elpais.com.co/elpais/entretenimiento/noticias/muere-cantante-rap-venezolano-canserbero|archive-date=September 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Allegedly Canserbero stabbed Molnar to death and then jumped to his own death from the tenth floor of the building.<ref>{{cite news|title=AK Canserbero Dead: Rapper Tirone González Cause of Death Reportedly Suicide Following Alleged Murder of Zion TPL Bassist|url=http://www.latinpost.com/articles/32881/20150120/ak-canserbero-dead-rapper-tirone-gonz%C3%A1lez-cause-death-reportedly-suicide.htm|accessdate=January 21, 2015|work=Latin Post|date=January 20, 2015}}</ref> However, several members of his family have expressed several doubts regarding the police investigation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/entretenimiento/dos-anos-muerte-canserbero_76580|title=A dos años de la muerte de Canserbero|last=Morales|first=María Alejandra|date=January 20, 2017|work=El Nacional|access-date=February 7, 2018|language=es|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214164547/http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/entretenimiento/dos-anos-muerte-canserbero_76580|archive-date=February 14, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>
