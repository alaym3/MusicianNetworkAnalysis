'''Paris, Texas''' was an American [[punk rock]] and [[emo]]<ref name=AllMusic/> band signed to [[New Line Records]]. 

==Background==
Paris, Texas was formed in [[Madison, Wisconsin]] in December, 1997 by Scott Sherpe, Sam Vinz, Nick Zinkgraf (all three of whom were college roommates at the time), Matt Tennessen and Matt Mangan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statepress.com/article/2003/02/playing-apart|title = Playing apart}}</ref> They recorded a five-song demo tape in January, 1998 in [[Rainer Maria]] bassist (and Matt Tennessen's former Ezra Pound band mate) Kaia Fischer's basement and played their first show at Whole Music Club in Minneapolis with Rainer Maria the next month on Valentine's Day.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20010728124728/http://www.paris-texas.com/bio.htm</ref>

Rainer Maria drummer Bill Keuhn brought the band's demo to the attention of [[Polyvinyl Record Company|Polyvinyl Records]] and were signed shortly thereafter, releasing a self-titled EP in the fall of 1998, and full-length album ''So, You Think it's Hot Here?'' in October, 1999. Guitarist Matt Mangan departed shortly after it's release and was replaced by Nolan Treolo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onmilwaukee.com/articles/paristxstory|title=New Line infuses new life into Milwaukee's Paris Texas|date=12 August 2004}}</ref> The ''Brazilliant'' EP followed in October, 2000.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhAEAAAAMBAJ&dq=paris+texas+Scott+Sherpe&pg=PA16|title = Billboard|date = 26 August 2000}}</ref>

A friend who was an intern at [[New Line Records]] shared a demo recording of "Hip Replacement" with the label heads, which led to the band being singed and beginning work on ''Like You Like An Arsonist'',<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20040603050205/http://www.newlinerecords.com/bands/paristexas/</ref> which was released in 2004 after an eight month recording session and the band relocating to [[Milwaukee]].

According to ''CMJ New Music Magazine'':

:”Furious punk guitars that sound more rock than emo, backed by chaotic  but somehow precise drumming...it's hard to believe Paris Texas were ever considered emo at all - there's much more bark than whine.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fsgq8HLorz4C&dq=paris+texas+band+cmj&pg=PA10|title = CMJ New Music Report|date = 29 March 2004}}</ref>

A remix of the song "Bombs Away" is featured on the [[Blade: Trinity (soundtrack)|Blade: Trinty]] Soundtrack.
