==Musical style and influences==
Alvvays' music has been described as [[jangle pop]] by the music press and its members. According to Rankin, the band's emphasis is primarily on strong melodies, rather than for a specific genre.<ref name="v13"/> The band has been compared to [[Camera Obscura (band)|Camera Obscura]]; Rankin noted she shared vocalist [[Tracyanne Campbell]]'s "fondness for the pathetic perspective."<ref name="spin15"/> Rankin sought inspiration from [[Stephin Merritt]], frontman of [[the Magnetic Fields]], appreciating the honest but lighthearted nature of his lyrics.<ref name="i13">{{cite news|title=Discovery: Alvvays|work=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]|access-date=October 22, 2015|date=November 23, 2013|url=http://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/discovery-alvvays/#_|author=Hannah Ghorashi}}</ref> Rankin's personal influences include [[The Magnetic Fields]], [[Teenage Fanclub]], [[Dolly Mixture (band)|Dolly Mixture]], [[the Smiths]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[the Primitives]], and [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]].<ref name="spin15"/><ref name="v13"/> While the band does not have an overt [[Celtic music]] sound, Rankin acknowledges that she was immersed in the genre from childhood, and it has a discernible influence on the way she sings and writes melodies.<ref>[http://www.aux.tv/2014/08/torontos-alvvays-welcome-you-to-the-jangle-on-their-debut-album/ "Toronto's Alvvays welcome you to the jangle on their debut album"].
