==History==
=== ''Cool Is Just a Number'' (2009–2010) ===
I Fight Dragons was formed in 2008, with all five members hailing from Chicago. Their first EP, ''[[Cool Is Just a Number]]'', was self-released in 2009. In June, 2009, Mike Mentzer left the band to pursue his own solo career and was replaced by Packy Lundholm, who had played drums on the band's first EP, and has since played lead guitar in the band. On July 25, 2009, I Fight Dragons headlined the [[Metro Chicago|Metro]] in Chicago for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/event/1134559+I+Fight+Dragons+at+Metro+on+25+July+2009|title=I Fight Dragons|work=last.fm}}</ref>  This show was captured as a Live DVD, and a limited run of 500 numbered and signed copies of the DVD, entitled "Dragon Fight!", were released in January 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ifightdragons.com/LiveDVD.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208153842/http://www.ifightdragons.com/LiveDVD.html |archive-date=2010-02-08 }}</ref> In August 2009, Dave Midell left the band to pursue humanitarian causes.  Chad Van Dahm was brought in as the new drummer.

The band signed with manager J.J. Italiano<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.steelgiant.net/mainframe/roster/ |title=Steel Giant Management » Roster |publisher=Steelgiant.net |access-date=2010-12-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724082818/http://www.steelgiant.net/mainframe/roster/ |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and with booking agent Gabriel Apodaca of The Agency Group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theagencygroup.com/agent.aspx?AgentID=182 |title=The Agency Group &#124; Agent Overview |publisher=Theagencygroup.com |access-date=2010-12-04}}</ref> in September 2009, signing their first major label contract.  I Fight Dragons went on their first National Tour with punk group [[Whole Wheat Bread (band)|Whole Wheat Bread]] and [[nerdcore]] rapper [[MC Chris]] in October of that same year. They played 45 US shows from 1 October to 24 November.<ref name="Gateway">{{cite web | url=http://media.www.unogateway.com/media/storage/paper968/news/2009/10/23/Entertainment/Mc.Chris.Makes.Geek.Chic.At.The.Waiting.Room-3812217.shtml | title=Geek Chic at the Waiting Room | access-date=2009-10-31 | author=Noelle Lynn Blood | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030111810/http://media.www.unogateway.com/media/storage/paper968/news/2009/10/23/Entertainment/Mc.Chris.Makes.Geek.Chic.At.The.Waiting.Room-3812217.shtml | archive-date=2009-10-30 }}</ref>

=== ''Welcome to the Breakdown'' (2010)===
I Fight Dragons signed with [[Photo Finish Records|Photo Finish]] / [[Atlantic Records]] in early 2010,  and went on to appear on the [[MTV]] "Too Fast For Love" tour, opening for [[3OH!3]], [[Cobra Starship]], and [[Travie McCoy]] from April–June 2010.<ref>Cobra Starship and 3OH!3 team up for explosive "Too Fast For Love" Tour {{cite web |url=http://www.atlanticrecords.com/pressreleases/article/?pressId=8a0af8122698250801269aaca1da0405 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-02-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106112436/http://www.atlanticrecords.com/pressreleases/article/?pressId=8a0af81224c70dce01252c16d46d7fc4 |archive-date=2010-01-06 }}</ref> In his June, 2010, concert review, Rick Florino described the band as "one of the most unique, uplifting and unforgettable new acts on the scene."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/entertainment-news/article/live-review-too-fast-for-love-tour-3oh-3-cobra-starship-travie-i-fight-dragons-club-nokia-los-angeles/6940462|title=Live Review: Too Fast for Love Tour — 3OH!3, Cobra Starship, Travie & I Fight Dragons — Club Nokia, Los Angeles|work=ARTISTdirect}}</ref> [[WWE|World Wrestling Entertainment]] announced that their song "Money" from their 2009 E.P.

On November 27, 2010, I Fight Dragons released their second EP, ''[[Welcome to the Breakdown]]''. They indicated that this EP consisted of songs  written for their Photo Finish / Atlantic Records debut album, but which ended up not having a place on the album and so were released as an EP instead.

=== ''KABOOM!'' (2011–2012) ===
''[[Kaboom! (album)|KABOOM!]]'' was released October 24, 2011. Its third single ''Save World Get Girl'' was released May 3, 2012 and was featured on [[Nintendo Video]] in late 2012.

=== Kickstarter album and ''The Near Future'' (2013–2014)=== 
On January 17, 2013 "cRaZie$" was released as the third and final single from ''KABOOM!''. The band was in the studio recording new music for an EP to be released in 2013. The band also released an Internet-only album composed of demos from 2010 and 2011 that were in various stages of development, but for various reasons never made it on ''KABOOM!'' titled ''DEMOlition: Songs That Didn't Make It On KABOOM!''. On June 21, 2013, "Move" was released as a single from ''DEMOlition'' and the music video features the four heroines of ''Phantom Breaker: Battle Grounds''.  In April 2013, the band launched "Project Atma", a Kickstarter project to fund their new album,<ref name="kickstarter.com"/> ''The Near Future''.  On June 13, 2014, the band announced that the release date for ''The Near Future'' would be September 16, 2014, and released the track "No Strings".
