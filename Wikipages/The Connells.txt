'''The Connells''' are an [[United States|American]] musical group from [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]. They play a guitar-oriented, melodic, jangle-pop style of [[rock music]] with introspective lyrics that often reflect the history or culture of the [[American South]].

Though mostly dormant since about 2001, the band never officially broke up and continues to occasionally perform to the present. The Connells are best known for their song "[['74–'75]]", which was successful across Europe, topping the charts in [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] and becoming a [[United Kingdom|UK]] Top 20 hit in 1995.

==Early history (1984–87)==
Guitarist [[Mike Connell (Rock musician)|Mike Connell]] formed the band in 1984 along with his brother David Connell on bass, Doug MacMillan on lead vocals,<ref name=sarah /> and future filmmaker [[John Schultz (director)|John Schultz]] on drums.<ref name=streak /> This initial four-person line-up was quickly supplemented by the addition of George Huntley on second guitar, keyboards, and vocals. Around the same time, former Johnny Quest drummer Peele Wimberley replaced Schultz, finalizing the "classic" line-up of the band.

An early version of "Darker Days", recorded by the band's initial four-piece lineup, appeared on the North Carolina indie compilation ''More Mondo'' in 1984. A re-recorded version of "Darker Days" provided the title track to the band's [[Darker Days (The Connells album)|debut album]], which was produced by fellow North Carolinian [[Don Dixon (musician)|Don Dixon]]. The album was released in 1985 on [[Elvis Costello]]'s Demon Records in the UK and the band's own Black Park Records label in the U.S., with slightly different track listings for each country. In addition to the title track, one of the most notable songs on the album was "Hats Off", an attack on then-President [[Ronald Reagan]]. After the release of the ''Darker Days'' album, the band re-recorded a more aggressive take of "Hats Off" for a 12" single, which was the second Connells release on Black Park, and the last until 2000. During this period, videos for the songs "Seven" and "Hats Off" were aired on MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]'' program.

==College success (1987–93)==
After touring heavily behind ''Darker Days'', the Connells re-entered the studio in 1986 with producer [[Mitch Easter]] to record their second album, ''[[Boylan Heights (album)|Boylan Heights]]''. The decision to work with Easter continued to perpetuate the comparisons to [[R.E.M.]] Mike Connell's songwriting on ''Boylan Heights'' would provide most of the foundation for the band's live show sound for the remainder of their career. The opener, "Scotty's Lament", featured the most explicit [[Celtic music|Celtic]] influence in the band's songbook, while the chorus lyric "I delight in my despair" satirized the band's early image as doom and gloom merchants ''a la'' [[Morrissey]] and [[The Smiths]]. Also notable is that the lyrics for that song originally included the sardonic twist, "I delight in ''your'' despair."

"Choose a Side" incorporates [[synths]] (played by Huntley), and "Over There" features an ironic military trumpet [[counter-melody]]. Closing ballad "I Suppose" was a haunting tribute to the Raleigh upper class neighborhood of [[Boylan Heights (Raleigh, North Carolina)|Boylan Heights]]. Although the band shopped ''Boylan Heights'' to various labels, the major record companies, including [[Columbia Records]], which expressed some mild interest, passed on it. The record was ultimately released in 1987 on mid-major [[TVT Records]], which had made its name releasing a series of "Tee Vee Toons" television theme song compilation CDs. TVT would prove to be no commercial match for R.E.M.'s own mid-major label, [[I.R.S. Records]], and over the next decade, The Connells would engage in a series of disputes with the label, on at least one occasion suing, unsuccessfully, to break their recording contract.

''Boylan Heights'' was a substantial [[college radio]] hit, and The Connells continued to tour relentlessly. During this period, both Connell and Huntley began to move away from their twelve-string [[Rickenbacker]]s towards six-string Fender and Gibson guitars, leading to a heavier, less folky sound, although elements of the band's patented jangle were still audible on "Hey Wow", the lead single from ''[[Fun and Games (The Connells album)|Fun and Games]]'', the 1989 follow-up album. Other songs, such as "Something to Say" and "Upside Down" were heavier, featuring power chords, as well as the most self-lacerating lyrics to date from Connell. ''Fun and Games'' also saw Huntley's role as a songwriter grow; after contributing one song each to ''Darker Days'' and ''Boylan Heights'', Huntley wrote or co-wrote five tracks on ''Fun and Games'', with the anthemic "Sal" quickly becoming one of the most popular songs in the band's live set. CD pressings of ''Fun and Games'' included a bonus track, "Fine Tuning".

''Fun and Games'' was quickly followed in 1990 by ''[[One Simple Word (album)|One Simple Word]]'', which was recorded in Wales with U.K. producer [[Hugh Jones (producer)|Hugh Jones]]. Jones had previously produced various British bands that the band had admired. Despite the high quality of the songs and improved playing by the band, notably on the Connell-MacMillan collaboration "Stone Cold Yesterday" and Connell's own "Get a Gun" which were both college radio hits with videos, the band struggled to reach a higher level of success, although "Stone Cold Yesterday" notched the band a No.&nbsp;3 hit on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart, where "Get a Gun" also reached No.&nbsp;24. This album saw the band stretch their sound and playing further, as on Connell's debut as a lead vocalist, the plaintive ballad "Waiting My Turn", which featured [[Kate St. John]] on [[cor anglais]], but also saw the reworking of two songs that dated back to the ''Darker Days'' era, "Too Gone" and "Take a Bow". Some critics have contended that the album/tour/album cycle was by this point outstripping Connell's ability to compose new material. This is why the increasing contribution of other songwriters in the band became important as lead vocalist, Doug MacMillan also contributed a song, "Another Souvenir", that he had written on his own.

=='''74–'75'' and European success (1993–96)==
After a three-year recording hiatus, which included more legal jousting with TVT Records and the addition of Steve Potak on keyboards, a rejuvenated Connells released ''[[Ring (The Connells album)|Ring]]'' in 1993. Though the lead single, "Slackjawed", was another college radio hit in America, the band was initially disappointed with the album's reception and considered breaking up. However, the follow-up single, "[['74–'75]]", another [[Celtic music|Celtic]]-influenced ballad, took off in Europe shortly thereafter and became a top-20 hit across the continent, including in the [[United Kingdom]] where it peaked at No.&nbsp;14 in the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

"'74–'75" won numerous European music awards in the mid-1990s, leading to greater financial and radio success than the band had known to that point. "'74–'75" also appeared in the 1995 [[film]], ''[[Heavy (film)|Heavy]]''. However, while European music fans made ''Ring'' a platinum record outside the United States, such high level success in America still remained elusive. ''Ring'' reached No.&nbsp;36 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> ''Ring'' also marked the debut of David Connell stepping up as a songwriter by co-writing a song for the record, "Hey You". MacMillan's role as a songwriter also increased on this album, contributing three songs. The band also played "Slackjawed" on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]].

==Later career (1996–2001)==
1996's ''[[Weird Food and Devastation]]'' expanded the band's sound in new directions, but failed to build on the momentum established by its predecessor. It was produced by the band's longtime soundman, Tim Harper, later known for his production work for [[Whiskeytown]]. The title of the album reportedly alluded to the band's impressions of Europe during their seemingly endless tours there in support of "'74–'75". It featured a starker and heavier production than the more melodic ''Ring''. By now, Connell and MacMillan shared songwriting duties about equally, with Connell's style taking a quirkier turn on songs such as "Adjective Song". Lead single "Maybe" was more in line with the anthemic pop songs of the band's early days, but his remaining songs on the album were often odd and dissonant compared to his previous work. "Friendly Time" abandoned coded attacks on Ronald Reagan for coded attacks on rock critics such as [[Robert Christgau]] and [[J. D. Considine]]. The album also debuted the songwriting efforts of drummer Wimberley with the track “Any”, who also landed an outtake, “Bitter Pill”, on the soundtrack of the film Scream. The band shot [[music video]]s for "Maybe" (a parody of the [[Burt Reynolds]] film ''[[Deliverance]]'') and "Fifth Fret" (which was a parody of the [[Alfred Hitchcock]] film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''). The band was invited to perform for a second time on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' where they performed "Maybe". Their tour for the album was cut short in early 1997 when MacMillan became extremely ill prior to a show. He had been experiencing stomach pains for over a year, but believed it was due to his poor diet while on the road. After undergoing emergency surgery, he was diagnosed with [[diverticulitis]] and took several months off to recover.<ref name=mtv>{{cite web|author1=gil kaufman|title=Connells' Singer's Recovery Stops Tour|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/509525/connells-singers-recovery-stops-tour/|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=3 October 2015|date=26 April 1997}}</ref>

In 1998, the band released ''[[Still Life (The Connells album)|Still Life]]'', which marked their final album for TVT. Produced by [[Jim Scott (producer)|Jim Scott]], ''Still Life'' marked a departure from the harder sound of ''Weird Food and Devastation'' with an overall softer feeling reminiscent of the [[Counting Crows]] and [[Teenage Fanclub]]. Mike Connell's contributions to the record included a long-standing song with the band that was originally known as "Brown", which was re-titled "Dull, Brown, and Grey". It was the band's only album to include songwriting contributions from all members, with MacMillan taking a decreased role in the album's writing. Peele Wimberley departed the band later that year and was replaced by Steve Ritter.

The band released ''[[Old School Dropouts]]'' on the revived Black Park Records label in 2001. The band produced and recorded the record in Steve Potak's studio and promoted it sparingly in the American South. The song "Washington" received some airplay on alternative radio.

== Current activities ==

After the release of ''Old School Dropouts'', George Huntley left the band to spend more time with his family and begin a career in real estate. Mike Ayers was added in George's place on lead guitar. Meanwhile, Peele Wimberley briefly played with another band called Parklife, and then moved to Los Angeles to pursue interests in Hollywood and in electronic music. He is currently a member of the Los Angeles band, The Lamps. David, who lost his first wife to cancer,  remarried and has a career in landscape painting and art shows, and brother Mike is practicing law in Raleigh. Huntley is now selling [[real estate]] and working part-time at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]] music department. In 2010, Joel Rhodes played on [[trumpet]] and [[flugelhorn]]  until 2017.  After several years with Steve Ritter and Chris Stephenson on drums, Rob Ladd was added as the drummer in early 2012.

Due to family and career commitments, the band does not play together as regularly any more.<ref name=sarah /> The performances are normally in the southeastern United States, usually at benefit concerts and [[music festivals]].

The band's catalog was acquired by Bicycle Recording Company, an independent publisher based in Beverly Hills, CA in April 2010 <ref>{{cite web|last=Christman |first=Ed |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ib2760edf9d29719ea50a14bb9abbf3f0 |title=Bicycle Acquires TVT Assets |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=2010-04-06 |access-date=2012-05-08}}</ref> and has reissued the band's TVT catalog digitally through [[IODA]] (The Independent Online Distribution Alliance). The releases became available August 31, 2010 on most digital music stores.

As of April 2013, the band was recording new material at Baby Topanga Studios. New songs include "Stars", "Burial Art", "Mr. Lucky", and "Helium".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/connellsmusic/status/323884232294400001|title=The Connells|author=|date=|work=Twitter|access-date=3 October 2015}}</ref>

On September 27, 2014, The Connells celebrated their 30th anniversary with a show in their hometown of Raleigh, NC.  The show featured a surprise appearance from original member [[George Huntley (musician)|George Huntley]] playing and singing on multiple songs throughout the show.

On January 25, 2020, the band played at Ram's Head Live in Baltimore playing a set that included three songs from a "new record" supposedly coming out in 2020.

On October 31, 2020, The Connells played at a live webcast concert at the Cat's Cradle via internet, where they once again play some new songs which are to yet to be released.

As of 2021, there are plans to release the new album, now titled "Steadman's Wake", sometime later that year, concerning the circumstances of the COVID pandemic.

On September 24, 2021, the first new studio album in 20 years called "Steadman's Wake" was released on CD, vinyl and all digital formats. It features eleven new songs, of which three are re-recordings of songs from their previous album. 
Beforehand, the band released three songs from the new album as singles: "Really Great", "Stars" and the title track "Steadman's Wake".

==Influences and sound==
From the beginning of the group, Mike Connell wrote both the music and the lyrics of the majority of the band's songs, although he was not the band's primary lead singer. Connell's influences included the 1960s guitar pop of his childhood, including [[The Byrds]] and [[The Beatles]]; in an early interview, he stated that the first song he wrote as a teenager was titled "Psychedelic Butterfly".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Connell and other members of the Connells band were also influenced by then-contemporary British bands such as [[The Smiths]] and [[Echo & the Bunnymen]]. Another, more idiosyncratic, influence was the British progressive rock band [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], whose song "Living in the Past" was covered by the Connells on 1995's ''New Boy'' EP.  Like [[Peter Buck]] of [[R.E.M.]] and [[Johnny Marr]] of The Smiths, Connell and Huntley played [[Rickenbacker]] guitars for the first several years of the band's career, creating a jangly, folk-rock sound reminiscent of [[The Byrds]] and other Southern U.S. and [[North Carolina]] bands of the era, such as the [[dB's]] and [[Let's Active]].

Although the Connells were frequently dismissed as R.E.M. imitators due to the Athens, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] band's overwhelming popularity relative to that of its contemporaries, there were significant differences between the two bands. First of all, the Connells' influences occurred at the same time that R.E.M.'s influences occurred. Connell and Huntley both played twelve-string Rickenbackers, as opposed to the six-string models favored by R.E.M.'s Buck; this gave the Connells an even janglier sound. Whereas Buck's guitar style featured heavy use of arpeggios, Connell's style was primarily based on strummed open chords in the keys of G and D, with a strong Celtic feel to songs such as "Scotty's Lament" and "[['74–'75]]". Likewise, Connell's lyrics were clearer and more direct than the stream-of-consciousness lyrics of Michael Stipe. The melancholy lyrics of early songs such as "Darker Days" drew comparisons to The Smiths, and an early feature on the band in the ''[[Raleigh's Spectator Magazine]]'' music weekly dubbed them "Raleigh's local depressants".{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

==Side and solo projects==
During the early days of the band, Doug MacMillan often played with other local Raleigh bands.  He is also the voice of [[Captain Stickman]] in the Captain Stickman vs. Color Black videos.

In 1996, George Huntley released a solo record of additional material that he had written over the years he spent with The Connells, titled ''Brain Junk''. The record was released on The Connells' record label, TVT.  ''Brain Junk'' featured Huntley's honesty and the trademark jangly guitar work which was evident on early Connells recordings.  This effort was quite different from Huntley's contributions to The Connells (such as "Sal", "Doin' You", and "Motel"), and featured a more stripped-down sound as well as some songs which sound as if they could have come a Connells release. On this record, Huntley explored various styles that did not fit in with The Connells' sound.
