'''The Outlaws''' were an [[England|English]] [[instrumental]] [[musical ensemble|band]] that recorded in the early 1960s.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p19718|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography by Bruce Eder |publisher=Allmusic.c om |access-date=7 March 2009}}</ref> One-time members included [[Chas Hodges]], (born Charles Nicholas Hodges in 1943), [[Bobby Graham (musician)|Bobby Graham]] (born Robert Francis Neate in 1940), [[Ritchie Blackmore]] (born Richard Hugh Blackmore in 1945), [[Mick Underwood]] (born Michael John Underwood in 1945), Reg Hawkins (born Reginald Hawkins in 1942), Billy Kuy (born William John Kuy Jnr. in 1940), Don Groom (born Donald Groom in 1939), Roger Mingaye (born in 1942), Ken Lundgren and Harvey Hinsley.<ref name="AMG"/>

Their name was originally conceived by [[Joe Meek]] (born Robert George Meek in 1929), who needed a [[backing group]] for [[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]]'s "Set Me Free" in 1960,<ref name="Larkin60">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Sixties Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0149-X|page=334}}</ref> after, according to Meek biographer, John Repsch, Meek had fired Berry's original backing group, The Statesmen.<ref name="AMG"/> After that [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]], they continued being one of the [[house band]]s of his [[recording studio]] at 304 Holloway Road, [[London]].<ref name="Larkin60"/> As such, they were used for recordings, [[demo (music)|demo]]s and [[audition (performing arts)|audition]]s. Many of their songs were [[songwriter|written]] by Meek, and credited to  one or other of his pseudonyms, either Robert Duke or Peter Jacobs; the latter of which he used on The Outlaws' "Shake with Me".<ref name="Larkin60"/>

They appeared as themselves in the 1963 [[United Kingdom|British]] film, ''[[Live It Up! (film)|Live It Up!]]''.

In addition to featuring as a backing band on recordings by [[Mike Berry (actor)|Mike Berry]] (born Michael Hubert Bourne in 1942), including three [[hit single]]s, or backing Houston Wells, [[Gene Vincent]], [[John Leyton]], [[Geoff Goddard]] or [[Heinz Burt|Heinz]], they also recorded [[single (music)|singles]] in their own right.<ref name="Larkin60"/> One of these, "Bike Beat", for [[Raleigh Bicycle Company]], (see below), even had dance instructions created especially for it, printed on the picture sleeve, with bicycle references : "Grab a girl at random, make like a tandem".

In 1990, all of their 1960s singles were issued on ''The Outlaws Ride Again (the Singles A's and B's )'', on the See For Miles Label.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book
