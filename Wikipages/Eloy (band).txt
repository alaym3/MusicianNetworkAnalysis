'''Eloy'''  is a German [[progressive rock]] band, whose musical style includes [[Symphonic rock|symphonic]] and [[space rock]], the latter tendency being more prevalent on earlier albums. Despite their nationality and time period, the band is not generally considered [[krautrock]] because of their sound, which has much more in common with English progressive rock and symphonic rock groups such as [[Pink Floyd]], [[King Crimson]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], and [[Camel (band)|Camel]].<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who's Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|page=121}}</ref>

== History ==
Founded in 1969 by guitarist [[Frank Bornemann]], the band has endured several line-up changes, with Bornemann being the only consistent member of the group.<ref name="LarkinHM" /> In the 1980s, after a series of major splits in the group, Bornemann pursued a more commercial direction. However, in later years, former members of the band re-joined, and in 1998 released the album ''Ocean 2'', a return to the classic symphonic progressive rock genre for which the band was well known. Despite attracting a large following in Germany, the band never gained popularity in the [[United States]].

The name Eloy is based on the futurist race of humans from the book ''[[The Time Machine]]'' by [[H. G. Wells]] (there spelled "Eloi"). Bornemann described the origin of the name of the band thus: "Wells describes in his book the situation of mankind about 800,000 years later, and 'Eloy' is a human race in his story. The Eloy in Wells' story have made a new start with the help of the time traveler. In a way, it was a new beginning for the human race. German rock bands in the late 1960s played mainly covers from other bands instead of playing their own compositions. Record deals for German bands were absolutely rare and German bands generally were considered to be second class bands in their own country. At that time it was a strong effort for a German band to come out with only their own compositions. It was a start into an unknown future, and from this point of view, comparable to the human race in Wells' story. That is why I got the idea to name the band 'Eloy'."<ref name="history">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eloy-legacy.com/eloy.php?Area=history&Sub=epoch1|title=ELOY Legacy|website=Eloy-legacy.com|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>

Bornemann reunited Eloy for its 40th anniversary in 2009. After a break of eleven years, the band released a new album called ''Visionary'', aiming to recapture the spirit of the early years. A double DVD ''The Legacy Box'' was released in December 2010 and contains a number of videos and television recordings from all periods of the band, as well as a documentary of the band's history.<ref name="news">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eloy-legacy.com/eloy.php?Area=history&Sub=epoch4|title=ELOY Legacy|website=Eloy-legacy.com|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref>

The band played at festivals in Germany and Switzerland in July 2011 with largely the same personnel as those on the 1994–1995 tour.<ref name="2011tour">{{Cite web|url=http://www.eloy-legacy.com/eloy.php?Area=music&Sub=welcome|title=ELOY Legacy|website=Eloy-legacy.com|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref> The band was booked to headline the [[NEARfest|North East Art Rock Festival]] in June 2012<ref name="nearfest">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nearfest.com/lineup.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102034651/http://www.nearfest.com/lineup.asp|url-status=dead|title=Nearfest.com|archive-date=2 November 2011|website=Nearfest.com|access-date=15 November 2019}}</ref> – its first North American concert – but had to cancel after Bornemann was injured in road accident in March. In 2017 and 2019 two new CDs based on the legend of [[Jeanne d'Arc]] were released.
