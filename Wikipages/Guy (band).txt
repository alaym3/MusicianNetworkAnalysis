'''Guy''' is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Soul music|soul]] group founded in 1987 by [[Teddy Riley]], [[Aaron Hall (singer)|Aaron Hall]], and Timmy Gatling. Hall's younger brother [[Damion Hall]] replaced Gatling after the recording of the group's self-titled debut album. The group released [[Guy (album)|their debut album]], which went on to sell over a million copies and was certified double platinum. In following their success, the group dropped their second album "[[The Future (Guy album)|The Future]]" in 1990, which also charted with successful singles and received platinum as well. Following their nearly decade long split, the group returned with their [[Guy III (album)|third album]] before the 2000s millennium, which charted with their hit single "[[Dancin' (Guy song)|Dancin']]".

Guy held the credit as the pioneers of the [[new jack swing]] genre with their early interactions of their work, which was developed and mainstreamed by group member [[Teddy Riley]] himself.

==Overview==

===Origins===

==== Kids at Work (1984-1986) ====
[[Teddy Riley]] and Timmy Gatling grew both up in the [[Harlem]] section of [[New York City]]. Both family households of their childhood were musically aspired in the late 70s, such bands as [[the Gap Band]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire|Earth Wind & Fire]] and [[The Jackson 5|the Jacksons]] held inspirations to become musicians. As soon they discovered themselves in local live bands for ages around 12 to 20, Gatling and Riley have sought their talents on each other. Teddy was earlier in a band called the "Climates" as a 12-year-old prodigy piano player before their engagement. At the time, a music related businessman [[Gene Griffin]] was scouting for young artists and owned a label called [[Sounds Of New York]], which had artists such [[Indeep]] known for the “[[Last Night a D.J. Saved My Life|Last Night A D.J. Saved My Life]]” hit single. Griffin brought onto attention to Teddy Riley and offered a contract to sign, to become the kid group ''“Kids At Work”''. The distribution went through [[Sony Music Publishing]] on big hopes and promotions, to compete as an offspring band like [[New Edition]] at that time. The band consisted of Teddy Riley playing the keyboard, Timmy Gatling as singing, playing bass and [[Clurel Henderson]] as lead singer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Timmy Gatling 2020 Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuaGn5TfFAA|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

In 1984, they released their self-titled debut album with another Single EP, which had popular local response by radio plays.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Discogs: Kids At Work|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/artist/371149-Kids-At-Work|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> The group eventually dropped out the label in relation to Griffin’s sudden incarceration and lack of management eventually on the young members of the group. Teddy Riley would go on individually as producer to other projects, such producing “[[The Show (Doug E. Fresh song)|The Show]]” for [[Doug E. Fresh]] that became eventually one of hip hop's known classic in the early days.

==== Guy (1987-) ====
After the breakup of their previous band Kids at Work, Timmy Gatling would meet Griffin again in later years. Griffin offered Gatling in regards of business interests a new deal to create a band, which Gatling held in mind.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Teddy+Riley|title=Teddy Riley|work=Last.fm|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> Gatling later used to work in [[Abraham & Straus]] in the shoe department.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Teddy Riley revisits crafting Guy’s debut album {{!}} Return To The Classics|url=http://soulculture.com/music/teddy-riley-revisits-crafting-guys-debut-album-return-to-the-classics/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> During work, he discovered the talent of his colleague [[Aaron Hall (singer)|Aaron Hall]], who had musical experience by expressing himself in gospel music and sung in choirs at the Bethel Gospel Tabernacle in [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]], [[Queens]] . Gatling introduced Hall to Teddy Riley, where they decided to set up a group by the name of ''Guy''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vq4ci-7BuQ|title=Teddy Riley New Jack Swing Hip Hop part 1|work=YouTube|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> The name ''Guy'' is based on their fashion statement, which they got from business names of local fashion shops in [[Harlem]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title="Timmy and I took him to this store named Two Guys. It was here where we found our style for the group. At this store, we found the name for our group also. We took the ‘s’ off of Guys and removed the ‘Two’ and that’s how we came up with the name Guy for our group.” Teddy Riley, SoulCulture|url=http://soulculture.com/music/teddy-riley-revisits-crafting-guys-debut-album-return-to-the-classics/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> [[Gene Griffin]] would become their manager and credited as producer as he introduced them to [[Uptown Records]] founder [[Andre Harrell]], who immediately signed the trio.<ref name=":1" /> During the recording of their debut album and the settlement of their contract to [[MCA Records]], the members would fall into arguments and personal hardships where Timmy Gatling went not signing the contract and dropped out of the group due to personal reasons.<ref name=":0" /> [[Damion Hall]] would later join the group by the request of his brother Aaron.<ref name=":0" />

As well as writing songs for their own group, Riley and Hall collaborated on other songwriting and production projects, including [[Bobby Brown]]'s "[[My Prerogative]]" and [[Johnny Kemp]]'s "[[Just Got Paid (Johnny Kemp song)|Just Got Paid]]."<ref name="autogenerated1" />

===Mainstream success and breakup (1988-1991)===
Under the guidance of manager [[Gene Griffin]], the trio signed to [[Andre Harrell]]'s [[Uptown Records]] and released [[Guy (album)|''Guy'']] in June 1988. Gatling was forced out of the group by Gene Griffin because he refused to sign the management contract giving Gene Griffin full control of their publishing and income. His face was kept on the album because he was officially part of the group and the MCA Records needed his permission to release the album.

Records]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Timmy Gatling – Help|url=https://www.discogs.com/Timmy-Gatling-Help/release/1759540|website=discogs.com|publisher=Discogs|access-date=March 14, 2016}}</ref> and wrote and produced songs such as "Promises, Promises" for [[Christopher Williams (singer)|Christopher Williams]] and "[[When Will I See You Smile Again?]]" for [[Bell Biv DeVoe]].

Five singles were released from ''Guy'', only one of which, "I Like," charted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. However, four of the album's singles became significant ''Billboard'' R&B chart hits: "Groove Me" (#4), "Teddy's Jam" (#5), "I Like" (#2), and "Spend the Night" (#15) helped propel the album to [[RIAA certification|double platinum]] status.<ref name="autogenerated1"/> In addition, "'Round and 'Round (Merry Go 'Round of Love)" reached #24 on the R&B chart, and "Piece of My Love" also received some airplay on R&B stations. ''Guy'' reached #1 on the ''Billboard'' R&B album chart and, more impressively, climbed to #27 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart without a major pop hit.

The band contributed the song "My Fantasy" to the soundtrack to [[Spike Lee]]'s film ''[[Do the Right Thing]]'' in 1989. Riley and Gene Griffin also worked with [[Boy George]], producing his R&B hit "Don't Take My Mind on a Trip." However, that same year Guy split acrimoniously from Griffin.<ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YqNszTc71aw|title=Teddy Riley New Jack Swing Hip Hop part 3|work=YouTube|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Gene+Griffin|title=Gene Griffin|publisher=Discogs.com|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref> Riley continued to produce and remix for other artists and firmly established himself as the figurehead and driving force behind new jack swing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muQPt5vsO0M|title=Teddy Riley New Jack Swing Hip Hop part 2|work=YouTube|access-date=October 1, 2014}}</ref>

In November 1990 Guy released its second album, [[The Future (Guy album)|''The Future'']]. Although still not scoring Top 40 pop hits, the album's five singles became R&B hits: "Wanna Get Wit U" (#4); "Let's Chill" (#3); "Do Me Right," featuring [[Heavy D]]) (#2); "D-O-G Me Out" (#8); and "Let's Stay Together" (#16) took the album to platinum status. In 1991 Guy made an appearance in [[Mario Van Peebles]]'s film ''[[New Jack City]]'', performing the song of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Jack City Cast List|publisher=IMDb.com|access-date=October 1, 2014|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102526/fullcredits#cast}}</ref>

After touring behind ''The Future'', the group split up, later citing "the tragedy of our ex-manager," Gene Griffin, as the reason for Guy's disbandment.<ref name="autogenerated2"/> One of their final recordings during this period was a cover of [[Wilson Pickett]]'s ''[[Land of a Thousand Dances]]'' for the 1992 animated film ''[[FernGully: The Last Rainforest]]''. Riley then focused on producing other artists, such as Heavy D and [[Michael Jackson]], and formed a new group, [[Blackstreet]]. The two Hall brothers each pursued solo careers during the '90s.

===Reunions===
Guy has reformed periodically since their initial break-up, the first of which occurred in 1995, with the release of the song "Tell Me What You Like", but an album did not follow at that time.

In 1999, Riley and the Hall brothers reunited to release their first album in nine years titled ''[[Guy III (album)|Guy III]]''. The album featured the modest hit "Dancin'" produced by Eddie F, Darren Lighty and G-Wise, which peaked at No. 19 on the US Hot 100 chart, becoming surprisingly their biggest hit on the pop charts. However, the album was poorly promoted and as quickly as it was released it dropped from the public consciousness. The group disbanded again soon after, but reformed periodically from 2005 onwards, and despite rumours of another album, they have yet to release another.

In 2006 they were part of New Jack Reunion Tour line up, along with [[BLACKstreet]], [[Tony! Toni! Toné!]], [[After 7]], [[New Edition]], and [[SWV]].

Riley and the Hall brothers reunited at the 2009 [[BET Awards]], performing "I Like" as part of a new jack swing medley.<ref>[http://www.bet.com/Specials/betawards09/betawards09_videos/betawards09_video_showperformances.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished?episodeid=3277&videoindex=7&playerid=betawards08]   {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706050953/http://www.bet.com/Specials/betawards09/betawards09_videos/betawards09_video_showperformances.htm?wbc_purpose=Basic&WBCMODE=PresentationUnpublished%3Fepisodeid%3D3277&videoindex=7&playerid=betawards08 |date=July 6, 2009 }}</ref>

Speaking in March 2010 to noted UK R&B writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of the award-winning [[Blues & Soul]] – Riley confirmed he is no longer involved with Guy. He went on to perform with the group again in October 2010. But the reunion was short-lived following claims by other band members that Riley had not properly distributed royalties he had collected on behalf of Guy.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}

On January 16, 2011, Aaron and Damion performed without Teddy at BET Honors in Washington DC. "Guy brought the audience to its feet with new-jack-swing-era hits Let's Chill and Groove Me."  – The Washington Post. The performance at BET Honors became a trending topic on Twitter when it aired on February 21, 2011. The duo appeared again on February 17, 2011 on the TV One Black History Month special "Way Black When." As of 2013, Riley has announced he's returned to Guy and will be working with Guy as well as [[Blackstreet]]. Riley's return in 2013 was short and he left once again according to Aaron Hall. In August 2014, Riley announced via his official Instagram that he has reunited with the Hall brothers with a new website and tour coming soon.<ref>{{cite web|title=Teddy Riley's Instagram Page|url=http://instagram.com/p/r0ByrgmHqA/?modal=true|website=instagram.com|publisher=Instagram|access-date=August 18, 2014}}</ref>
