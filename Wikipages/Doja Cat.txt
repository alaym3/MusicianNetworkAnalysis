'''Amala Ratna Zandile Dlamini'''<!--Before removing "Ratna", refer to the discussion on talk page which indicates that "Ratna" and "Zandile" are Doja Cat's middle names and that "Amala" is simply her first name.--> (born October 21, 1995), known professionally as '''Doja Cat''' ({{IPAc-en|d|oʊ|d|ʒ|ə}}), is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. Born and raised in Los Angeles, she began making and releasing music on [[SoundCloud]] as a teenager. Her song "[[So High (Doja Cat song)|So High]]" caught the attention of [[Kemosabe Records|Kemosabe]] and [[RCA Records]], with which she signed a joint record deal at the age of 17, subsequently releasing her debut EP ''[[Purrr!]]'' in 2014.

After a hiatus from commercial music and the uneventful release of her debut studio album, ''[[Amala (album)|Amala]]'' (2018), Doja Cat earned [[Viral phenomenon|viral success]] as an [[internet meme]] with her 2018 single "[[Mooo!]]", a [[novelty song]] in which she fantasizes about being a cow. Her second studio album, ''[[Hot Pink (album)|Hot Pink]]'' (2019), reached the top 10 of the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and spawned the single "[[Say So (Doja Cat song)|Say So]]", which topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart following the release of a remix featuring [[Nicki Minaj]]. This album was followed by ''[[Planet Her]]'' (2021), which spent three consecutive weeks at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200 and spawned the top 10 singles "[[Kiss Me More]]" (featuring [[SZA]]) and "[[Need to Know (Doja Cat song)|Need to Know]]".
