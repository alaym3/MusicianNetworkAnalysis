== Life and music career ==
Price was born in [[Far Rockaway, Queens]], New York City, and began singing in church as a toddler. Her first professional engagement was with George Michael at Madison Square Garden in January 1992. During rehearsals for the 1992 Grammy Awards the next month, Price was overheard singing in the rehearsal hall by [[Mariah Carey]] while everyone else was on a meal break. Price was later introduced to Carey's husband, Sony Columbia's then CEO [[Tommy Mottola]], and was offered a job as a background singer for Carey, which she accepted until 1997.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kelly Price on Meeting Mariah Carey|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbr-dMb13Ps|work=YouTube}}</ref>

She released her second album, ''[[Mirror Mirror (Kelly Price album)|Mirror Mirror]]'', in 2000 on the Def Soul imprint of [[Def Jam Records]]; Island and Def Jam had merged in 1999, with Price and labelmates [[Dru Hill]] being reassigned to Def Soul.

In October 2005, Price recorded her first live gospel album.

Price was inducted as an honorary member of [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] sorority in July 2006. In early 2007, Price kicked off a tour with the 'Sisters in the Spirit 2007'.<ref>[http://www.livedaily.com/news/Sisters_in_the_Spirit_tour_back_in_2007-11192.html?t=1 Live Daily News report on Kelly Price] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061217194826/http://www.livedaily.com/news/Sisters_in_the_Spirit_tour_back_in_2007-11192.html|date=December 17, 2006 }}</ref>

In 2006, she recorded the song "Why?" for the soundtrack ''[[Why Did I Get Married?]]'', the film version of ''Why Did I Get Married? Priceless Secrets from The Soul of A Woman'', in which Price created the role of Sheila alongside [[Tyler Perry]] who used the song titles and lyrical content of Price's hit recordings to develop the story. In early 2009, she was featured on [[Coko]]'s gospel album entitled ''[[The Winner in Me]]'' on the track "Oh Mary". In June 2010, Price promoted her single "Tired" on The Jazz Joy and Roy syndicated radio show as "some of the best work of my career to date."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gail Mitchell|title=Kelly Price Returns to R&B Roots on New Album|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/471805/kelly-price-returns-to-rb-roots-on-new-album|work=Billboard|access-date=January 9, 2012}}</ref> The song was also featured in Tyler Perrys 2011 film ''[[Madea's Big Happy Family]]''. On February 9, 2012, in a pre-[[Grammy]] party to celebrate Price's nominations, the singer sang "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" with [[Whitney Houston]] in what turned out to be Houston's last public performance two days before her death. In September 2009, it was announced she would be joining [[Deborah Cox]] and [[Tamia]] to form the super group The Queen Project. The women seek to empower women of all ages, races and backgrounds by doing a number of community service projects.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krista Henry|title='The Queen Project' to debut at Jazz and Blues Fest|date=January 26, 2010|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20100126/ent/ent1.html|publisher=The Gleaner|access-date=January 9, 2012}}</ref>

In September 2021, Price was declared missing as reported by [[TMZ]].

=== Legal issues ===
On July 16, 2010, a lawsuit was filed in a Texas federal court by Price against a nationally known prosperity ministry, New Light Church of [[Houston]], ''et al.'' Other defendants in the case include New Light's pastor, I. V. Hilliard, wife, Bridget Hilliard and daughter, Preshea Hilliard. Price claims she wrote and copyrighted the tune, "Women Who Win," which New Light Church and three members of the Hilliard family used without permission in a church show, on DVDs, on a website and at a "Women Who Win" conference in Houston. The original court docket<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/07/19/WWW.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 22, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716032426/http://www.courthousenews.com/2010/07/19/WWW.pdf |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> indicates that the involved parties continued to use the work in a variety of ways despite being refused license to use.

In 2018, a lawsuit was filed against Price and her Atlanta-based company, Sang Girl Productions, alleging that Price took $25,000 to perform at a fundraiser for a non profit organization and then did not attend. The lawsuit alleges that she did not return the $25,000 advance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.phillymag.com/news/2018/06/25/bebashi-kelly-price-lawsuit/|title=Bebashi Sues R&B Singer Kelly Price Over Gala No-Show|last=mrernestowens|date=June 25, 2018|work=Philadelphia Magazine|access-date=May 3, 2019}}</ref>

== Breast cancer activism ==
In December 2000, Price donated $250,000 to fight breast cancer. She presented a check to Tony Martell of the T.J.

She was the chairwoman of the seventh annual Sister to Sister Fitness Festival held in [[Dallas]], Texas which was sponsored by the Celebrating Life Foundation. Claudia experienced pain in her breast in 1997, but said fear and a lack of insurance kept her from seeking immediate medical attention. Instead, she waited two years before seeing a doctor. While at work one day in 1999, her doctor called and said she had inflammatory breast cancer. Doctors gave her two months to live. She underwent chemotherapy, and the disease was in remission as of October 2006.<ref>Price is a member of Sigma Gamma Rho sorority [http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/news/city/southdallas/stories/DN-ocfocus_07met.ART.Central.Edition1.3e9162d.html ''Dallas News'' profile of Claudia Price]</ref>
