'''Gwar''', often stylized in all caps as '''GWAR''', is an American [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band formed in [[Richmond, Virginia]] in 1984, composed of and operated by [[List of Gwar members|a frequently rotating line-up]] of musicians, artists and filmmakers collectively known as [[Slave Pit Inc.]] Following the death of frontman and lead singer [[Dave Brockie]] in 2014, the group has continued without any of its founding members.

Easily identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar's core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate [[science fiction]]-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band's albums, videos, live shows and other media. Rife with over-the-top violent, sexual, and [[scatological humor]] typically incorporating social and political [[satire]], Gwar has attracted both acclaim and controversy for its music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of [[graphic violence]] that result in the audience being sprayed with copious amounts of fake blood, urine, and semen. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a "[[shock rock]]" band by the media.

Since its formation, Gwar has released thirteen studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among [[Gwar discography|other recordings]], and has sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on [[MTV]] as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime [[talk show]]s, satirizing the topics of [[censorship]] and [[media violence research|media violence]]. Though the band's mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated [[cult following]]. The band's extensive [[Gwar videography|videography]] consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992's ''[[Phallus in Wonderland]]'', which earned a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for [[Best Long Form Music Video]]. Gwar has also expanded its brand into other areas such as [[book]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/gwar-let-there-be-gwar-book/|title=GWAR History Revisited in 'Let There Be GWAR' Book|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> [[comic book]]s<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/gwar-orgasmageddon-comic-june/|title=GWAR to Release 'Orgasmageddon' Comic in June|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> [[board game]]s,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2019/07/30/gwar-begin-crowdfunding-new-card-game/|title=GWAR Begin Crowdfunding New Card Game|date=July 30, 2019|website=Decibelmagazine.com|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> [[beer]],<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tampabay.com/things-to-do/food/spirits/gwar-cigar-city-brewing-team-up-for-beer/2133914/|title=GWAR, Cigar City Brewing team up for latest mix of bands and beers|newspaper=[[Tampa Bay Times]]|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> [[whisky]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/yes-heavy-metal-band-gwar-has-a-rye-whiskey-and-its-good|title=Yes, Heavy-Metal Band GWAR Has a Rye Whiskey and It’s Good|first=Max|last=Watman|date=July 29, 2021|access-date=September 9, 2021|website=Thedailybeast.com}}</ref> [[barbecue sauce]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rvamag.com/music/gwar-presents-the-world-premiere-of-gwar-b-q-sauce/|title=GWAR Presents The World Premiere Of GWAR-B-Q Sauce|first=Marilyn Drew|last=Necci|date=March 11, 2013|website=Rvamag.com|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> [[Cannabidiol |CBD]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/gwar-cbd-bud-of-gods/|title=GWAR Officially Launch 'Bud of Gods' Signature CBD Line|website=Loudwire.com|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref> and [[construction of electronic cigarettes#E-cigarette liquid|e-liquid]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://consequence.net/2014/05/gwar-launch-gwar-fluids-the-most-delicious-e-liquids-in-the-entire-universe/|title=GWAR launch GWAR Fluids, "the most delicious E-liquids in the entire universe"|website=Consequence.net|date=May 1, 2014|access-date=September 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Stage performance==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2021}}
The band's characteristic costumes are generally made of [[foam latex]], [[polystyrene#Extruded polystyrene foam|polystyrene foam]], and hardened rubber. The costumes cover very little of the band members' bodies; the bare parts are accentuated with makeup. They further their production in concert by spraying their audiences with simulated bodily fluids. Most of the fluids are made of water and powdered [[food coloring]] which, for the most part, flakes off or washes out easily. The thicker fluids are made from a clear seaweed extract called [[carrageenan]], which is also used as a thickener and [[Emulsion|emulsifier]] in ice cream and milkshakes. Gwar does not use syrups or [[stage blood]] because they are dry solids and can damage the band's costumes and equipment.

Another trademark of Gwar's live show is its mutilations of celebrities and figures in current events. Notable victims have included [[O. J. Simpson]], [[John Kerry]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Barack Obama|every]] [[George W. Bush|American]] [[Bill Clinton|President]] [[George H. W. Bush|since]] [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Jerry Garcia]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Osama Bin Laden]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Al Gore]], [[John McCain]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Paris Hilton]], [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Lady Gaga]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Jerry Springer]], [[Mr. Lordi]], [[Sarah Palin]], [[Snooki]], [[Mitt Romney]], [[Pope Francis]], [[Justin Bieber]], [[Tony Abbott]], [[Donald Trump]], and [[Joe Biden]]. The band also makes frequent references to political and historical figures, fantasy literature, and mythology. For instance, the song "Whargoul" makes reference to [[Minas Morgul]] as well as the [[Eternal Champion (character)|Eternal Champion]] of [[Michael Moorcock]]. Gwar also has many references to [[H. P. Lovecraft|Lovecraftian]] themes (Antarctica, Yig, Giant Penguins, Fleshy Insanities, etc.). In addition, the title of their fifth album ''RagNaRok'' comes from the [[Norse mythology|Norse mythological]] event [[Ragnarök]]. Gwar were nominated for two [[Grammy Award]]s, one for [[Best Metal Performance]] for "[[S.F.W.]]" and one for Best Long Form Music Video for ''[[Phallus in Wonderland]]''. The group's performances also included fire dancing until the Slymenstra Hymen character left the band.

==History==
===Formation and debut (1984–1989)===
Gwar is the end result of two separate projects merged into one. Dave Brockie was the vocalist and bassist for a punk band named [[Death Piggy]] that staged mini-plays and used crude props to punctuate its music.<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Helber|first1 = Bob|last2 = Tartan|first2 = Frances|last3 = O'Hara|first3 = Gail|title = Death Piggy Spews and GWAR Too|pages = 1, 12–13|newspaper = Commonwealth Times|location = Richmond Va|date = 1987-09-15|url = http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/com/id/8857|access-date = 2013-06-07|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141019204033/http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/com/id/8857|archive-date = October 19, 2014|url-status = dead}}</ref> Bands would occasionally practice in a room at the Richmond Dairy, a deserted [[bottling plant]] that had been taken over by [[hippies]]. The hippies rented out interior areas to various artists and musicians. It was at the Richmond Dairy that Death Piggy met [[Techno Destructo|Hunter Jackson]] (Techno Destructo) and Chuck Varga ([[Sexecutioner]]), both attendees of [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] who had set up "The Slave Pit", a production space for ''Scumdogs of the Universe'', a movie they intended to make.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slavepitinc.com/slavepit/timeline/index.html | title=Years 1984 – 1989 | work=Timeline | publisher=Slave Pit Inc. | date=2005-01-08 | access-date=2008-08-14 }}</ref> Jackson would create props for Death Piggy to use on stage. Brockie had an idea to use the costumes made for ''Scumdogs of the Universe'' and have Death Piggy open for itself as a barbaric band from Antarctica, playing nonsense songs while sacrificing fake animals. The name of the joke group was "Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh". The members of Death Piggy began noticing that more people were coming to see Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh and leaving immediately after the set. After several refinements, including shortening the band's name, Death Piggy was phased out in favor of the band now named Gwar.

[[File:Gwar-george-bush.jpg|180px|left|thumb|Abuse of [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] character – live at Reds, [[Edmonton]]]]
The first known line-up for Gwar consisted of Ben Eubanks (vocals), Brockie (guitar), Steve Douglas (guitar), Chris Bopst (bass guitar), Jim Thomson (drums) and Jackson. However, this line-up was short-lived and would suffer multiple changes in the following months, with Eubanks quitting after just one or two shows and being replaced by Joe Annaruma, who went on to record several demo tracks with the band. Annaruma soon quit and was replaced by Brockie. The band solidified into a line-up consisting of Jackson, Don Drakulich, Varga, Mike Delaney, Mike Bonner, Scott Krahl, Dave Musel and Brockie.<ref>{{cite news|last = Helber|first = Bob|title = Halloween with GWAR|page = 14|newspaper = Commonwealth Times|location = Richmond Va|date = 1986-11-04|url = http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/com/id/7922|access-date=2013-06-06}}</ref> Mike Delaney left in 1987. Dewey Rowell ([[Flattus Maximus]]), Michael Bishop ([[Beefcake the Mighty]]) and Rob Mosby ([[Nippleus Erectus]]) were recruited in 1987, along with Steve Douglas ([[Balsac the Jaws of Death]]), who rejoined the band after having previously left. [[Danielle Stampe]] (alias: Slymenstra Hymen) joined in 1988 as the first full-time female member of Gwar for the first U.S. tour supporting Gwar's debut album ''[[Hell-O]]'' and toured consistently with the band until 2000.The band has also recruited, and lost, three other female members: The Temptress, Heather Broome (1986); Amazina, [[Colette Miller]] (1986–87); and Gwar Woman, Lisa Harrelson (1987–88).

The band's debut album, ''Hell-O'', a crossover [[thrash metal]]-[[punk rock]] album, was released in 1988 under [[Shimmy Disc]]. The band started touring in support of the album, with Steve Douglas leaving that same year, later to form the alternative band Log, and being replaced by current rhythm guitarist [[Michael Derks]], who took over Douglas' alias as Balsac the Jaws of Death.

However, the band's line-up underwent further changes before 1990. In 1988, the Slave Pit saw the joining of Bob Gorman, a young, new artist who would help with the art design and fabrication aspects of the band. One year later, in 1989, Rob Mobsy left the band and was replaced by Pete Luchter, who also quit to be replaced temporarily by Jim Thompson, who had been in the band prior to the release of ''Hell-O''. Thompson later quit and was replaced by Brad Roberts, who has since portrayed [[Jizmak Da Gusha]].

===''Scumdogs of the Universe'' and ''This Toilet Earth'' (1990–1994)===
With Gwar's line-up somewhat solidified, the band would set up to record ''[[Scumdogs of the Universe]]'' released worldwide on producer Ivan Healy Purvis' label Master Records, a subsidiary of [[Blue Beat Records]]. The album met a moderately large mainstream success and would mark the start of a career under the [[Metal Blade Records]] record label. The band would tour extensively in support for this album,<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Pollock|first1 = Matt|last2 = Johns|first2 = Jim|title = A firsthand account of the mayhem that is GWAR|pages = 1, 10–11|newspaper = Commonwealth Times|location = Richmond Va|date = 1990-09-18|url = http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/com/id/11096|access-date = 2013-07-24|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131007034135/http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/com/id/11096|archive-date = October 7, 2013|url-status = dead}}</ref> releasing the ''[[Live from Antarctica]]'' produced by Ivan Healy Purvis, VHS tape in July 1990, containing, among other things, the music video for the song ''[[Sick of You (Gwar song)|Sick of You]]''.  It was shortly after the video's release when the Slave Pit took in another new, young artist, Matt Maguire, to help out with costume fabrication, as well as illustrations for comics and related material.

In August 1990, the birth of Michael Derks's daughter resulted in his taking a short break from the band. Barry 'D'live' Ward from the band [[Rich Kids on LSD]] filled in on guitar as Balsac during Gwar's 1991 European tour.<ref>{{cite book|author=Sharpe-Young, Garry.|page=162|year=2005|title=New Wave of American Heavy Metal|publisher=Zonda Books Limited|isbn=0-958268-40-1}}</ref> On September 18, 1990, Brockie wore his "Cuttlefish of Cthulhu" codpiece during a show in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], resulting in Brockie's arrest and, ultimately, a one-year ban from the band performing in the state of [[North Carolina]]. Upon returning home, Gwar filmed its first cameo in a mainstream film, ''[[Mystery Date]]''.

''Scumdogs of the Universe'' was originally released through the U.K. label Master before being picked up by Metal Blade in 1991. In the group's hunt for a larger label, they auditioned for [[Relativity Records]], one of the larger independent heavy metal labels. The group failed their audition when they arrived in costume and Slymenstra Hymen broke a blood capsule from her [[codpiece]] onto one of the office chairs, simulating menstruation.

The band suffered further line-up changes during this period, with Dewey Rowell leaving the band in 1991 and not being replaced until 1992 by Pete Lee, after the recording of ''[[America Must Be Destroyed]]''.The Charlotte, North Carolina incident from 1990 was the inspiration for Gwar's third album, ''America Must Be Destroyed'', released in 1992. The album was accompanied by the movie ''[[Phallus in Wonderland]]'', which documented the main concept and contained music videos for the album. ''Phallus in Wonderland'' was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] in 1993. After recording for ''[[This Toilet Earth]]'' was completed, bassist Mike Bishop left the band. He was replaced by Casey Orr, from the band [[Rigor Mortis (band)|Rigor Mortis]].

''This Toilet Earth'' was released in 1994, to moderate success. The album received additional attention due to controversy surrounding "B.D.F.", a song that graphically refers to subjects such as sodomy, necrophilia, pre-natal rape, pedophilia and mutilation. 1994 also saw the music videos for "Saddam a Go-Go" and "The Road Behind" being aired on ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''. This would also mark the beginning of the band straying from their trademark sound, as the album contained several experimental songs as opposed to the punk of ''Hell-O'' and thrash of ''Scumdogs of the Universe''.

===''Ragnarok'', ''Carnival of Chaos'' and ''We Kill Everything'' (1995–2000)===
[[File:Gwar-02.jpg|left|thumb|Gwar started their [[Edmonton]] show with simulated [[decapitation]].]]
In 1995, Gwar released ''[[Ragnarok (Gwar album)|Ragnarok]]'', an album characterized by a unique sound, including the use of keyboards, something largely unseen before by the band, as well as a much larger use of secondary vocalists. The record is considered to have been largely unnoticed after the success of the previous three albums. Despite this, the band would record two videos for the album, "Surf of Syn" and "Meat Sandwich" as well as release ''[[Rendezvous with Ragnarok]]'' to support the album's plot through footage from the supporting tour. Later that year, the band also made a cameo appearance in the film ''[[Empire Records]]''.

The band's first side project, [[X-Cops (band)|X-Cops]], would also come to life after the Ragnarok tour, releasing their only full-length album, ''[[You Have the Right to Remain Silent... (album)|You Have the Right to Remain Silent...]]'', the same year.

[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]] developer [[id Software]] hired Gwar to produce a showcase space at [[Microsoft]]'s Judgement Day event for Halloween of 1995.<ref name="mastersofdoom">{{cite book |author=Kushner, David |title=[[Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture]] |publisher=Random House Publishing Group |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-375-50524-9}}</ref>

Gwar appeared in a video game focused [[Circuit City]] television advertisement in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRAMZVY-xS4|title=GWAR - Circuit City Commercial 1996|date=September 4, 2006|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

The band's next record would come out in 1997 under the name ''[[Carnival of Chaos]]'', proving to be the epitome of this experimental period containing songs from many different genres, including the classic [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], but also [[hard rock]], [[country music|country]], and even [[jazz]].  Shortly after the release of ''Carnival of Chaos'', select members of the Gwar ensemble appeared on ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' to discuss the growing trend of "shock rock" and their role as entertainers.  Aside from their appearance on ''[[Joan Rivers|The Joan Rivers Show]]'', this guest appearance is still recognized as one of their most infamous appearances on national TV. In 1998, Gwar fought the [[ska]] band, [[The Aquabats!]], during The Ska Parade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonska.net/news/gwar-vs-the-aquabats/1336/ |title=GWAR vs The Aquabats on The Ska Parade; RIP Dave Brockie &#124; Boston Ska (dot) net |website=Bostonska.net |date=2014-03-24 |access-date=2015-05-30}}</ref>

''Carnival of Chaos'' would be the last album with Pete Lee on guitar, being replaced by Tim Harriss who had previously been in the band around 1986 and was featured as a guest guitarist on ''[[America Must Be Destroyed]]''. For the recording of ''[[We Kill Everything]]'' between late 1998 and early 1999, [[Michael Bishop (bassist)|Michael Bishop]] would temporarily rejoin the band as the bassist during the absence of Casey Orr. The record, largely influenced by [[punk rock]], is the band's least favorite album and thus its songs are rarely played live.

Following this, co-founder, Hunter Jackson, left the group in 2000 to focus on personal projects. Danielle Stampe also left the band to focus on a personal project named ''Girly Freakshow''; however, she rejoined the band temporarily for the Bitch Is Back tour in 2002.

===''Violence Has Arrived'' and ''Live from Mt. Fuji'' (2001–2005)===
[[File:Gwar-10.jpg|thumb|right|Gwar in concert in [[Edmonton]]]]
Due to the band's distaste for the previous album, Gwar's sound changed considerably for the next recording. With Tim Harriss gone, Zach Blair was hired to fill his spot as [[Flattus Maximus]], Casey Orr also having returned to the band as [[Beefcake the Mighty]] for the recording of the band's first entirely [[thrash metal]] album in years: ''[[Violence Has Arrived]]'', released on November 6, 2001, the album being seen as a "comeback" of sorts and setting off changes that resulted in the current state of the band. ''Violence Has Arrived'' was, however, the band's last album on [[Metal Blade Records]], with the band leaving the label soon after the recording and releasing of it.

In 2002 [[Zach Blair]] left Gwar to form the power-pop band Armstrong along with drummer Brad Roberts. The band released one album titled ''Dick the Lionhearted''.  Since February 2007, Blair has been the guitarist for [[Rise Against]].

As the band focused on a heavier, more brutal sound near the end of this period, it would also result in the creation of another side project, the [[Dave Brockie Experience]], a band created by frontman [[Dave Brockie]] along with rhythm guitarist Mike Derks and drummer [[Jizmak Da Gusha|Brad Roberts]] as a way of continuing the comedic sound found on albums like ''[[We Kill Everything]]'' while maintaining a more serious focus in releases by Gwar. They released their first LP on March 20, 2001, ''[[Diarrhea of a Madman]]''.

This was not the end of Gwar's new focus on heavy sound, as was proven with the release of ''Violence Has Arrived'' by their most successful album in several years, ''[[War Party (album)|War Party]]'' in 2004 on their new record label, [[DRT Entertainment]]. The album met with a large underground success, as it followed the same path ''Violence Has Arrived'' did, but this time with a more serious and technical edge, partially thanks to the efforts of new lead guitarist Cory Smoot ([[Flattus Maximus]]) and bass guitarist Todd Evans ([[Beefcake the Mighty]]). Videos were released for "Bring Back the Bomb" and "War Party," and the band was invited to play on the Sounds of the Underground tour in 2005. That same year the band released ''[[Live from Mt. Fuji]]'', the band's first live album besides the then extremely rare ''[[You're All Worthless and Weak]]'', released in 2000 (and re-released in 2006) on [[Slave Pit Records]].

In 2004 Gwar teamed up with [[Grey DeLisle]] (as the voice of Grandma Stuffum) in the ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' episode "Operation F. O. O. D. F. I. T. E."; the band was credited as Rawg and the songs "The Private Pain of Techno Destructo", "Morality Squad", and "Gor-Gor" were performed with new lyrics, pertaining to the episode, written for each song.

Gwar began work on their next album, tentatively titled ''Go to Hell!'', in January 2006. That same month, Gwar opened a gallery show called "The Art of Gwar" at Art Space gallery in Richmond to display the many props, costumes, cartoons, paintings produced by The Slave Pit, Gwar's art and effects studio.<ref>{{cite news|last1 = Galloway|first1 = James |title = The art of GWAR|pages = 1, 14|newspaper = Commonwealth Times|location = Richmond Va|date =  2006-02-06|url = http://dig.library.vcu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/com/id/13066 |access-date=2013-09-12}}</ref>

On February 23, 2006, Gwar's official website announced Gwar's album, officially titled ''[[Beyond Hell]]'', for which, at the urging of [[DRT Entertainment]], a cover version of [[Alice Cooper]]'s "[[School's Out (song)|School's Out]]" was recorded and released.<ref name=Ultimateguitar.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/Gwars_corey_smoot_we_try_to_make_music_as_kick-ass_as_the_stage_show.html |title=Ultimate Guitar Cory Smoot interview |access-date=2006-10-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109020455/http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/interviews/interviews/gwars_corey_smoot_we_try_to_make_music_as_kick-ass_as_the_stage_show.html |archive-date=November 9, 2006 }}</ref> The music video was directed by David Brodsky on July 2, 2006. The part of the "school marm" has been mistakenly identified as Devin Townsend, the producer of the ''Beyond Hell'' CD.  It is actually Scott Krahl, a long-time Gwar "slave" and inventor of Gor-Gor. "School's Out" was nominated for Best Video of 2006 on MTV2's ''Headbanger's Ball''.

The ''Blood Bath and Beyond'' DVD was released on June 20, 2006, containing exclusive behind the scenes and vintage footage of the band.

Gwar performed a special "half-time" show at the Sounds Of The Underground 2006 tour. Gwar went on to headline the following year's Sounds of the Underground Tour in 2007.

Vocalist [[Oderus Urungus]] is also featured on the last [[Strapping Young Lad]] album [[The New Black]] as a guest vocalist on the song "Far Beyond Metal". Oderus' lines in the song are taken directly from the Gwar song "Maggots" ("now in the halls of the Necrolord..." etc.). Scott Krahl is in the "School's Out" video as a female teacher, with whom Oderus makes out before mounting "her" at the end of the video.

''[[Beyond Hell]]'' was released on August 29, 2006, with Gwar touring to support the album and being helped by the creation of new props for this tour, including several characters from ''Beyond Hell''{{'}}s plot, including Jitler and Jewcifer. Gwar was also present at the third annual Rock & Shock festival from October 13 to 15 as a part of this tour.

In Spring 2008 Todd Evans left Gwar to focus efforts on his project Mobile Deathcamp. Shortly after Todd's departure, Casey Orr was confirmed to return as Beefcake the Mighty.

Sleazy P. Martini returned to the stage with Gwar during their Electile Dysfunction '08 tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gwar.net/home.php |title=Gwar NEWS |work=Gwar homepage |publisher=Slave Pit Inc. |year=2008 |access-date=2008-08-13 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812130435/http://www.gwar.net/home.php |archive-date=August 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2009, Gwar celebrated their 25th year as a band. Gwar's eleventh studio album, ''[[Lust in Space]]'', was released on August 18, 2009,<ref>{{Cite news | url=http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=135&csid2=6&fid1=40126 | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730190400/http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=135&csid2=6&fid1=40126 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2012-07-30 | access-date=2010-04-03 | work=[[Exclaim!]] | date=August 2009 | title=Gwar's Oderous Urungus | first=Keith | last=Carman }}</ref> through Metal Blade Records.

On April 3, 2012, a television sit-com created by horror filmmaker Adam Green and starring Brockie portraying Oderus Urungus titled ''Holliston'' debuted on the FEARnet cable television network. The series starred Oderus as series lead Green's imaginary alien friend who lives in his closet. Brockie toured and appeared with his castmates as Oderus at many live performances of ''Holliston'' across the United States in 2012 and 2013. Green also appeared on stage with Gwar several times when the band had him introduce their encore performance. The full ''Holliston'' cast was "murdered" on stage and fed to both Gwar's world maggot and meat grinder at several US shows. A third season of ''Holliston'' was being scripted by Green when Brockie died of a heroin overdose in March 2014.

Despite various explanations that Gwar is an acronym for something (such as "God what an awful racket"),<ref name="Allmusic">{{Allmusic |class= artist|id= p4420|tab= biography|label= Biography of GWAR |first= Steve |last= Huey|access-date= 2011-10-26}}</ref> band members have consistently stated that the letters do not stand for anything. The official website of [[Slave Pit Records|Slave Pit Inc.]] indicates that Gwar is a shortened version of "Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh", the name the band used originally when opening for [[Death Piggy]].
