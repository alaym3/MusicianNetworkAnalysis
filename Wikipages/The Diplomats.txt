'''The Diplomats''' (also known as '''Dipset''') is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] collective formed in 1997 by childhood friends [[Cam'ron]] and [[Jim Jones (rapper)|Jim Jones]] in [[Harlem]], New York City. The group was originally composed of Cam'ron, Jim Jones and [[Freekey Zekey]], all of whom grew up together in Harlem. In 1999, fellow Harlem-based rapper [[Juelz Santana]] joined the group.

In 2001, following Cam'ron's signing, the group secured a recording contract with Diplomat Records, Cam'ron's label. It subsequently began recording its debut album, ''[[Diplomatic Immunity (The Diplomats album)|Diplomatic Immunity]]'', and released it on the aforementioned labels in March 2003. Following tensions and controversy between Cam'ron and [[Jay-Z]], the group subsequently severed ties with [[Roc-A-Fella]] and signed with indie record label [[Koch Records]]. The group released its second album ''[[Diplomatic Immunity 2]]'', in November 2004 on Koch. After a hiatus because of artistic differences, in 2010 the original members began recording music together again and announced a reunion album. In February 2011, it was announced that the group had signed with [[Interscope Records]]. However, in May 2013, Freekey Zekey revealed it no longer recorded for Interscope. The group currently records for [[E1 Music]], the successor of Koch.

== History ==

=== Career beginnings and success (1997–2006) ===
The first commercial appearance of the group was on Cam'ron's 2000 album ''[[S.D.E. (album)|S.D.E.]]'', released on [[Epic Records]]. Cam'ron eventually demanded a release from Epic, and signed with [[Roc-A-Fella Records]], then owned by his childhood friend [[Damon Dash]]. Cam'ron released his third album, ''[[Come Home with Me]]'' through Roc-A-Fella. The album featured numerous guest appearances from Juelz Santana and Jim Jones. The lead singles were platinum hits "[[Oh Boy (Cam'ron song)|Oh Boy]]" and "[[Hey Ma (Cam'ron song)|Hey Ma]]", which both featured Santana.<ref name="comeplat">{{cite web| url = http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=1447| title = Cam'ron Strikes Platinum| access-date = October 4, 2006| author = Strong, Nolan| date = December 23, 2002| publisher = AllHipHop.com |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061020053746/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=1447 |archive-date = October 20, 2006}}</ref> The album served as both an introduction to The Diplomats and a stepping stone for the rest of the group to be signed to Roc-A-Fella.

The Diplomats followed Cam'ron's solo album shortly after with their debut album ''[[Diplomatic Immunity (The Diplomats album)|Diplomatic Immunity]]'' released in 2003, which featured a [[remix]] of "Hey Ma", as well as the lead single, "Dipset Anthem", produced by Heatmakerz which peaked at #64 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Billboard R&B Singles|Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart.<ref>[{{BillboardURLbyName|artist=the diplomats|chart=all}} Billboard.com]</ref> The double-disc album was a success and quickly became certified gold by [[RIAA]] less than two months after its release.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS|title=RIAA – Gold & Platinum Searchable Database – March 11, 2015|work=riaa.com|access-date=March 11, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS|archive-date=June 26, 2007}}</ref> By the time of the release of their 2004 followup, ''Diplomatic Immunity 2'', additional members [[Hell Rell]], [[40 Cal.]], and [[J. R. Writer]] had joined the group. Before long the Dipset empire was growing adding members such as:  [[Jay Bezel]], [[Un Kasa]], the late [[Stack Bundles]], [[Max B.]], comedian [[Katt Williams]], and female first lady, Jha Jha. In 2006, Jim Jones created his own person skating team, called Dipskate.

=== Artistic disagreements (2007–2009) ===
In mid-2007, rumors began to circulate that the Diplomats had many rifts and disagreements with each other, specifically between Cam'ron and Jim Jones. When Jones and Juelz Santana appeared on stage at a concert with [[50 Cent]] — with whom Cam'ron was engaged in a feud at the time — it seemed as if the group had split. However, in a later interview, 40 Cal. hinted that while the dynamic of the group is likely beyond repair, there may be further collaboration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7323/title.40-cal-warns-of-camrons-return-talks-dipset-unity|title=40 Cal Warns Of Cam'ron's Return, Talks Dipset Unity|author=HipHopDX|date=July 16, 2008|work=HipHopDX|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>
Juelz Santana also spoke on a future collaboration, but stated that at the time, Cam'ron seemed to be the only obstacle, while also stating that though his contract was sold to [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]], he had no hard feelings towards his former boss.<ref name="holdingjuelzback">(August 19, 2008) [http://www.defsounds.com/news/Was_camron_holding_juelz_santana_back Was Cam'ron holding Juelz Santana Back?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080913011201/http://www.defsounds.com/news/Was_camron_holding_juelz_santana_back |date=September 13, 2008 }} DefSounds Accessed August 17, 2008.</ref><ref name="juelzsold">(August 1, 2008) [http://www.defsounds.com/news/Juelz_santanas_contract_sold_to_def_jam Juelz Santana's contract Sold to Def Jam] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080911235755/http://www.defsounds.com/news/Juelz_santanas_contract_sold_to_def_jam |date=September 11, 2008 }} DefSounds. Accessed August 27, 2008.</ref>

In a September 2008 interview, Hell Rell stated that he no longer has a contractual obligation to Cam'ron or Jim Jones.  Within the interview, Juelz also stated that he is still on speaking terms with the members of the group, and didn't feel that they were holding him back, but he did feel the "mainstream" wasn't crediting him as notably as he had hoped.<ref>(September 9, 2008) [http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=hellrell2 September interview with Hell Rell] Accessed September 19, 2008.</ref>  In a later interview, he stated that he felt the other members of the group were not as focused as him, while also stating there was selfishness within the group.  He also stated he wanted to focus more on his solo career.<ref>RealTalkNY/Sean (September 15, 2008) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUqW20sKob0 Hell Rell Speaks On Why He Left Dipset] [[YouTube]]. Accessed September 21, 2008.</ref>

Following this, almost all former members of The Diplomats formed their own groups. In 2007, 40 Cal. started "Skeme Team",<ref name="waitinginthewings">Francesca Djerejian (February 22, 2007) [http://www.ballerstatus.com/article/features/2007/02/2231/ 40 Cal: Waiting In The Wings] BallerStatus Accessed August 27, 2008.</ref> while Freekey Zekey formed the "730 Dips",<ref name="730dipsyoutube">[https://www.youtube.com/user/730DipsOfficial 730DipsOfficial YouTube] [[YouTube]]. Accessed August 28, 2008.</ref> and started a record label of the same name, "730 Dips Records",<ref name="730dipsyoutube" /> while also joining fellow Diplomats' member Jim Jones' new group, "ByrdGang".<ref name="jjfzbg">[http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshh9yXQPBp7Q3ziL420 All those clicks are real gangs.v=wshh9yXQPBp7Q3ziL420Jim Jones, Freekey Zekey, & Byrd Gang Interview On Rap City! "Kanye West You Betta Watch M**** Mouth, Before I Pull You By That Glow In The Dark Pink, Stickin & Learn In The Nerd Lane"] WorldStarHipHop. Accessed August 28, 2008.</ref>

In 2008, Jim Jones cut ties with ByrdGang rapper and former Dipset affiliate [[Max B]] over a sequence of financial and ethical disputes. Jones and Max B became involved in a bitter feud, exchanging numerous diss tracks and constantly bad-mouthing each other on interviews.

In 2007, Jim Jones's Byrdgang member Stack Bundles was shot and killed on June 11 of that year.

In 2008, Juelz Santana started the "Skull Gang" which, when his contract was sold to Def Jam, also secured a deal that included the solo members.<ref name="holdingjuelzback" /> In 2009, Cam'ron started a new group called the U.N and Dipset West. In 2008, Hell Rell started Top Gunnas and J.R started Thundabyrdz.

In 2009, Cam'ron created the U.N. (Us Now), featuring himself and [[Vado (rapper)|Vado]]. The group released one album, 2011's, ''Gunz n' Butta'''.

=== Diplomats reunion & demise (2010–2015) ===
In April 2010, Cam'ron and Jim Jones officially announced the end of their feud.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.missinfo.tv/index.php/miss-info-exclusive-camron-and-jim-jones-rebuild-friendship-jimmy-issues-public-apology/|title=Miss Info Exclusive: Cam'ron and Jim Jones rebuild friendship, Jimmy issues public apology|publisher=MissInfo.tv|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref> In June 2010, the Dipset reunion began with a teaser titled "Under Construction" and a street single, "Salute", produced by [[AraabMuzik]] being released. The song features Jim Jones, Cam'ron and Juelz Santana. The remix features new Diplomat artist Vado with a verse added. In October 2010, after an interview at The Source Magazine Headquarters where Freekey Zekey insinuated that a Dipset deal with Interscope Records was possible by pointing to a magazine cover with [[Dr. Dre]]'s picture (in addition to the revelation that the group has actually recorded with Dre), Freekey confirmed that the group would be signing a deal with the label: "The papers are not actually signed right now, but you could basically say it's going down," said Freekey in an interview with TheQuestion.com, when asked about the possibility of a deal with Interscope.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hiphopsince1987.com/2010/news/freekey-zekey-says-the-diplomats-interscope-deal-is-going-down/|title=Freekey Zekey Says The Diplomats' Interscope Deal Is "Going Down"|work=Home of Hip Hop Videos & Rap Music, News, Video, Mixtapes & more|date=October 9, 2010|access-date=March 11, 2015}}</ref>
