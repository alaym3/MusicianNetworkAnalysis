'''Little Mix''' are a British [[girl group]] consisting of group members [[Jade Thirlwall]], [[Perrie Edwards]], and [[Leigh-Anne Pinnock]]; former member [[Jesy Nelson]] departed the group in 2020. The group rose to prominence by becoming the first group to win the British version of ''[[The X Factor (British TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in 2011. Their music style is mainly [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance-pop]], with influences from [[tropical house]], [[Latin pop]] and [[electronic music]], and lyrics that have often touched upon the themes of [[Feminism|female empowerment]], [[body positivity]], and [[LGBT]] rights.

Little Mix have achieved five UK number-one singles with "[[Cannonball (Damien Rice song)|Cannonball]]", their ''X Factor'' winner's single in 2011, "[[Wings (Little Mix song)|Wings]]" in 2012, "[[Black Magic (Little Mix song)|Black Magic]]" in 2015, "[[Shout Out to My Ex]]" in 2016, and "[[Sweet Melody (song)|Sweet Melody]]" in 2021. The group have released six studio albums, ''[[DNA (Little Mix album)|DNA]]'' (2012), ''[[Salute (Little Mix album)|Salute]]'' (2013), ''[[Get Weird]]'' (2015), ''[[Glory Days (Little Mix album)|Glory Days]]'' (2016), ''[[LM5 (album)|LM5]]'' (2018) and ''[[Confetti (Little Mix album)|Confetti]]'' (2020), all of which have peaked inside the top five of the [[UK Albums Chart]], making them the first girl group to score five top-five studio albums in the UK. Their debut album ''DNA'' is the highest-charting debut album by a British girl group on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

The group's fourth studio album ''Glory Days'' was their first number-one album on the UK Albums Chart. It spent five weeks at number one, the most by a girl group album since [[the Spice Girls]]' [[Spice (album)|debut album]]. It was the fastest-selling number-one girl group album in 15 years, and claimed the highest first-week UK album sales for a girl group album since [[Spiceworld (album)|''Spiceworld'']]. It holds the record as the longest-charting girl group album inside the top 40 on the UK Albums Chart. In 2021, Little Mix became the first girl group to spend a total of 100 weeks inside the top ten of the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Having sold over 60 million records worldwide, Little Mix are one of the world's [[List of best-selling girl groups|best-selling girl groups]]. They have been described as one of the greatest girl groups of all time, and in 2021 they were described as "the biggest girl group in the world".

Their accolades include three [[Brit Awards]], seven [[MTV Europe Music Award|MTV Europe Music Awards]] (the most wins for [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best UK & Ireland Act|Best UK & Ireland Act]]) two [[Teen Choice Award|Teen Choice Awards]], one [[iHeartRadio Music Award]], and six [[Global Awards]].

On 20 November 2011, Little Mix became the first girl group in the show's eight-year history to progress past the seventh live show. The previous longest-surviving girl groups were [[The Conway Sisters]] ([[The X Factor (British series 2)|series 2]]) and [[Hope (English band)|Hope]] ([[The X Factor (British series 4)|series 4]]), who had both lasted until week 7. Through the remaining course of the competition the group generally received positive feedback. During the semi-final stage of the show, Little Mix performed [[The Supremes]]'s "[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]" as well as [[Beyoncé]]'s hit "[[If I Were a Boy]]". Their performance of "You Keep Me Hangin' On" received mostly negative feedback from the judges with Walsh stating that they "lost their mojo" and Rowland telling the girl group she had seen them do "better vocal performances." Their second performance of the night, "If I Were a Boy", was generally acclaimed by the judges with Walsh telling them they have "amazing potential" and calling them the "next big girlband." Rowland also told them they could be "incredibly dynamic" and "change the world" when they find the strength within each other. It was later revealed that Little Mix topped the semi-final public vote by 34.4% and made it through to the show's final at [[Wembley Arena]] along with [[Marcus Collins]] and [[Amelia Lily]].

On 11 December, Little Mix were announced as the winners, the first time a group had won the British version of the show and the second (of five) in the worldwide franchise (after [[Random (band)|Random]] on the [[The X Factor (Australian season 1)|first series of the Australian version]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/tv/teen-duo-country-mum-battle-for-x-factor-ng-ya-132911|title=Teen, duo, country mum battle for X Factor|publisher=The West Australian|work=AAP|date=24 November 2015|access-date=15 February 2017|archive-date=9 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709011424/https://thewest.com.au/entertainment/tv/teen-duo-country-mum-battle-for-x-factor-ng-ya-132911|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Little Mix are first girl group to win the X Factor - CBBC Newsround|language=en-GB|work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/16135637|access-date=2021-09-17}}</ref> Their winner's single was a cover of [[Damien Rice]]'s song "[[Cannonball (Little Mix song)|Cannonball]]", which was released via [[music download|digital download]] on 11 December 2011, and on [[CD single|CD]] on 14 December 2011.<ref name="Amazon Cannonball 2011">{{cite web|work=Amazon.com|title=Cannonball|year=2011|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cannonball/dp/B006KVVS36/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323644261&sr=301-1|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-date=14 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191214094031/https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cannonball/dp/B006KVVS36/ref=sr_shvl_album_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1323644261&sr=301-1|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Hackford Jones 2011">{{cite web|author=Hackford Jones|title=X Factor Winners Little Mix Release Debut Single Cannonball|year=2011|url=http://www.hackfordjonespr.com/pages/posts/x-factor-winners-little-mix-release-debut-single-cannonball91.php|publisher=Hackford Jones PR|access-date=21 December 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326013202/http://www.hjpr.co.uk/|archive-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> ''The Xtra Factor: The Winner's Story'' was shown on ITV2 on 17 December 2011.<ref name="TVGuide 2011">{{cite web|title=The Xtra Factor: Winner's Story 2011|url=http://tvguide.co.uk/titlesearch.asp?title=The%20Xtra%20Factor:%20Winner\%27s%20Story%202011&|work=[[TV Guide]]|access-date=17 December 2011|archive-date=30 April 2013|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGJkryZW?url=http://tvguide.co.uk/titlesearch.asp?title=The%20Xtra%20Factor%3A%20Winner%5C%27s%20Story%202011&|url-status=live}}</ref> Their debut single topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 18 December 2011.<ref name="Music Week">{{cite web|author=Music Week|title=The Official UK Singles Chart [Week 50]|year=2011|url=http://www.musicweek.com/MusicWeekWeb/DisplayChart.aspx?menuname=promoCharts&pageName=&flag=1&year=2011&weekNo=50&chartid=2&chartname=The+Official+UK+Singles+Chart&paging=1&chartFamilyId=family-2&sectionHeader=Sales|access-date=21 December 2011|archive-date=18 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118112340/https://www.musicweek.com/charts|url-status=live}}</ref> They made the Christmas number one spot on the [[Irish Singles Chart]], beating novelty songs by [[The Saw Doctors]] and [[Ryan Sheridan (musician)|Ryan Sheridan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/1223/littlemix.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107203918/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/1223/littlemix.html|archive-date=7 January 2012|title=Little Mix claim Irish Christmas No.1|date=23 December 2011|access-date=23 December 2011|work=RTÉ Ten|publisher=[[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]]}}</ref>

The song debuted at number one on the UK Singles Chart with first-week sales of 98,932 copies.

In March 2014, Little Mix teamed up with BeatBullying, the largest anti-bullying organisation in Europe. The quartet is backing the anti-bullying media campaign "The Big March" and the #DeleteCyberbullying project. The campaign is urging the European Commission to introduce new laws to protect children from bullying and cyberbullying, for 77 million euros (£57m) to be set aside for services that protect them and for an annual awareness day to promote the movement. Pinnock said: "Myself and the girls have all experienced being bullied at some point in our life. When we see on Twitter that some of our fans are going through it now we find it so upsetting and that's the reason we feel so passionate about this campaign and the work that BeatBullying does."<ref name="Little Mix talk bullies">{{cite web| title=Little Mix talk bullies| url=http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/celebrities/1023074/little-mix-talk-bullies-and-ask-you-join-%E2%80%98-big-march%E2%80%99-online-help-th| date=2014| access-date=14 January 2017| archive-date=27 May 2014| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527230058/http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/celebrities/1023074/little-mix-talk-bullies-and-ask-you-join-%E2%80%98-big-march%E2%80%99-online-help-th| url-status=live}}</ref> In March 2014, Little Mix released a cover of [[Cameo (band)|Cameo]]'s single "Word Up!" as the official single for Sport Relief 2014.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a544605/little-mix-to-release-2014-sport-relief-single-word-up.html |title=Little Mix to release 2014 Sport Relief single 'Word Up' |work=[[Digital Spy]] |access-date=11 October 2020 |archive-date=24 September 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160354/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a544605/little-mix-to-release-2014-sport-relief-single-word-up.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The group also visited Liberia to witness the work paid for by the Sport Relief donations.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/little-mix-visit-liberia-sport-6532368.amp|title=Chart toppers Little Mix visit Liberia with Sport Relief|work=Chronicle Live|access-date=11 October 2020|archive-date=24 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024153321/http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/little-mix-visit-liberia-sport-6532368.amp|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2019, Thirlwall and Pinnock climbed [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] for [[Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a26485561/little-mix-good-luck-message-jade-thirlwall-leigh-anne-pinnock-comic-relief/|title=Little Mix send luck to bandmates as they start Kilimanjaro climb|first=Dan|last=Seddon|date=23 February 2019|website=Digital Spy|access-date=26 February 2019|archive-date=25 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190225050414/https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a26485561/little-mix-good-luck-message-jade-thirlwall-leigh-anne-pinnock-comic-relief/|url-status=live}}</ref>
