==History==

=== 2007–2010: Early beginnings ===
Marlon Fung (Issa Gold) and Akeem Joseph (AK) grew up just a few blocks from each other in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]]. The duo first met in 2007, after AK's friend brought Issa to his house one day to smoke [[marijuana]], where they clicked instantly and discussed [[psychedelic drugs]], which they would later do together along with fellow Brooklyn rappers [[Meechy Darko]] and [[Zombie Juice]], two of the [[Flatbush Zombies]].<ref name="complex1">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/growing-up-in-brooklyn |title=Growing Up In Brooklyn & Meeting — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref><ref name="sabotagetimes1">{{cite web|last=Proctor |first=Johnny |url=http://sabotagetimes.com/music/the-underachievers-their-new-age-psychedelic-hip-hop/ |title=The Underachievers & Their New Age Psychedelic Hip-Hop |publisher=Sabotage Times |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref>

=== 2011–2012: Career beginnings, signing to Brainfeeder ===
AK began [[rapping]] at the age of eleven, later on in high school he would work under the [[stage name]] The Underachiever.<ref name="complex2">{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/the-group-name-being-a-duo |title=The Group Name & Being a Duo — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Issa Gold started rapping much later, not taking it seriously until around late 2011. The duo then began making music together under the name "The Underachievers" after a producer pushed them to work together, which resulted in them forming the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/first-recordings |title=First Recordings — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Issa explained the name saying, "I feel like the things that we do could be considered underachieving, like we smoke pot. People would probably meet us at first and be like, They're probably just potheads. And then they'll talk to me, or talk to AK, and be like, 'alright, they're intelligent.' So it's just a flip on that. Like, The Underachievers, even though technically we're doing underachiever things, we're bringing positive energy."<ref name="complex2"/>

In May 2012, they released their first music video for the song "So Devilish".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/so-devilish |title="So Devilish" — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Following the videos release they began gaining attention quickly, with their second officially released song "Gold Soul Theory" getting played on [[BBC Radio]] in August 2012, even though they had yet to sign a recording contract. Their music was also passed on to [[record producer]] [[Flying Lotus]], who the following day flew them out to [[Los Angeles]] to meet them the day after they talked for the first time.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|author=Phillip Mlynar |url=http://www.mtvhive.com/2013/02/26/meet-the-underachievers-the-duo-flying-lotus-signed-on-first-listen/ |title=Meet the Underachievers, the Duo Flying Lotus Signed On First Listen |publisher=MTV Hive |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> After they met a few times and performed a few shows for him, he signed them to his [[Brainfeeder]] record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/linking-up-with-flying-lotus |title=Linking Up With Flying Lotus — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Flying Lotus said he already wanted to sign the duo after listening to one song for only 20 seconds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/features/otw-488-the-underachievers |title=OTW #488: The Underachievers &#124; Features &#124; Clash Magazine |publisher=Clashmusic.com |date=2012-03-30 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Around the same time they signed they released their third music video for "Herb Shuttles", which has gotten over seventeen million views on YouTube.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/herb-shuttles |title="Herb Shuttles" — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/ |title=Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref> Around mid-2012, The Underachievers, [[Pro Era]] and [[Flatbush Zombies]] formed the New York hip hop [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Beast Coast]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/02/who-are-the-underachievers/relationship-with-pro-erabeast-coast |title=Relationship with Pro Era/Beast Coast — Who Are The Underachievers? |publisher=Complex |date=2013-02-20 |access-date=2013-09-23}}</ref>
