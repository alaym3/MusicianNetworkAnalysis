[[File:Sohrab and Rostam fighting (TMoCA).png|thumb|upright|Sohrab and Rostam fighting:from "[[Shahnama|The Shahnama of Shah Tahmasp"]] (circa 1522)]]

'''Rostam''' or '''Rustam''' ({{lang-fa|رستم}} {{IPA-fa|rosˈtæm|}}) is a legendary hero in [[Persian mythology]], the son of [[Zāl]] and [[Rudaba]], whose life and work was immortalized by the 10th-century Persian poet [[Ferdowsi]] in the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', or ''Epic of Kings'', which contains pre-Islamic [[Iranian folklore]] and history. However, the roots of the narrative date much earlier.

In the ''Shahnameh'', Rostam and his predecessors are [[Marzban]]s of [[Sistan]] (present-day [[Iran]] and [[Afghanistan]]). Rostam is best known for his tragic fight with [[Esfandiyār]], the other legendary Iranian hero; for [[Rostam's Seven Labours|his expedition]] to [[Mazandaran (Shahnameh)|Mazandaran]] (not to be confused with the modern [[Mazandaran Province]]); and for tragically fighting and killing his son, [[Sohrab]], without knowing who his opponent was. He is also known for the story of [[Rostam's Seven Labours|Seven Labours]]. Rostam was eventually killed by [[Shaghad]], his half-brother.

Rostam was always represented as the mightiest of Iranian paladins (holy warriors), and the atmosphere of the episodes in which he features is strongly reminiscent of the [[Parthian Empire]]. He rode the legendary stallion [[Rakhsh]] and wore a special suit named [[Babr-e Bayan]] in battles.

==Origins==
While the narrative of the ''Shahname'' is the definitive work on Rostam, Ferdowsi did not invent the character; Rostam stories were popular as far back as the seventh century in [[Pars (Sasanian province)|Pars]] and originated much earlier, likely in Eastern Iranian-speaking territories. He famously wears the ''zīn-i palang'' or "panther-skin garment":

{{quote|The material surveyed so far proves that the Rustam legend was fully formed and well known in Western Iran by the seventh century AD at the latest and in the Eastern Iranian lands by the early eighth century. In some recent publications Frantz Grenet has attempted to find pictorial allusions several centuries earlier, in the “sīmurgh” depicted on the buckle of [[Shapur I]] (AD 240–272) on the [[Rag-i-Bibi|Rag-i Bībī]] rock relief in northern Afghanistan, and in the scene of a prince breaking in a foal depicted on an Eastern Sasanian silver dish attributed to the first half of the fourth century. [[Nicholas Sims-Williams]] has referred to the personal name Purlang-zin, spelt πορλαγγοζινο in Greek script, in a Bactrian document which was almost certainly written in the fourth century under Sasanian rule, claiming that this may be translated as “the man with the panther’s skin” and that it represents “a clear reference to the zīn-i palang of Rustam.” [...] the first element of this name, is the Bactrian word for “panther” or “leopard”.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sims-Williams |first1=Nicholas |last2=Sims-Williams |first2=Ursula |title=Rustam and his ''zīn-i palang'' |journal=Iran Nameh |date=Summer 2014 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=252–3 |url=http://213.32.55.132/index.php/journal/article/view/2146 |access-date=9 August 2020}}</ref>}}

In the ''Shahnameh'', Rostam is a native of [[Zabulistan]], a historical region roughly corresponding to today's [[Zabul Province]], southern [[Afghanistan]]. His mother Rudaba was a princess of [[Kabul]]. Rostam is the champion of champions and is involved in numerous stories, constituting some of the most popular (and arguably some of most masterfully created) parts of the ''Shahnameh''. In ''Shahnameh'', Rostam—like his grandfather Sam—works as both a faithful military general as well as king-maker for the [[Kayanian dynasty]] of Persia.

As a young child, he slays the maddened [[White elephant (animal)|white elephant]] of the king Manuchehr with just one blow of the [[mace (bludgeon)|mace]] owned by his grandfather Sam, son of Nariman. He then tames his legendary stallion, [[Rakhsh]].

The etymology of Rostam's name is from [[Proto-Iranian language|Common Iranian]] "*rautas-taxma-, "'river-strong', i.e. 'as strong as a river',<ref name="SW">{{cite journal |last1=Sims-Williams |first1=Nicholas |last2=Sims-Williams |first2=Ursula |title=Rustam and his ''zīn-i palang'' |journal=Iran Nameh |date=Summer 2014 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=250–1 |url=http://213.32.55.132/index.php/journal/article/view/2146 |access-date=9 August 2020}}</ref> Rostam's mother is ''Rūdāba'' "(she) of the River Water",<ref name="SW" /> and his father is [[Zāl]], who has white hair.

=== Birth and early life ===
Rostam's mother Rudaba, the princess of Kabul, was known for her peerless beauty, and Rostam's father was Zāl. Zāl was one of Persia's most powerful warriors and a great general who conquered many rebellious tribes and ruled over Zabulistan. Zāl was known for his wisdom and was unparalleled in riding and fighting on horseback. He once demonstrated his skills to Emperor Manuchehr to seek his approval to marry his lover Rudaba.

In Persian mythology, Rudaba's labour in giving birth to Rostam was prolonged due to the extraordinary size of her baby - so much so that [[Zāl]], her lover and husband, felt sure that his wife would die in labour. Rudaba was indeed near death when Zāl decided to summon the [[Simurgh]], which duly appeared and instructed him upon how to perform a ''Rostamzad'', a [[Caesarean section]], thus saving both Rudaba and the child.

After Zāl's father, Sam came to know of his grandchild's birth, he rushed to see Rostam and was overjoyed. Rostam was brought up and trained by Zāl in warfare. When Rostam single-handedly slew a mad elephant, his father sent him on his first military assignment.

Rostam's task was to conquer the fortress on the summit of Mt Sipand where his great grandfather, Nariman, once besieged it and was slain in the battle. Rostam breached the fortress, defeated the enemy, ransacked its treasury and reported his success to his father, Zāl and grandfather, Sam.

He undertakes a heroic journey to save his sovereign, the over-confident [[Kay Kāvus]] who is captured by the [[dev (mythology)|Div]]s of Mazandaran. This journey is called "Rostam's Seven Quests".

There are some similarities between the legends of Rostam and those pertaining to the great Irish hero [[Cú Chulainn]]. They both defeat a ferocious beast as a very young man, slay their sons in combat ("[[Rostam and Sohrab]]", a motif also found in the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]''), are virtually invincible in combat, and are murdered by treachery while killing their murderer on their last breath.<ref>Connell Monette, ''The Medieval Hero: Christian and Muslim Traditions''. (Saarsbruck: 2008).</ref>

Two Persian heroes, Rostam and Esfandiyār, share stories with the [[Labours of Hercules]].<ref>Connell Monette, ''The Medieval Hero: Christian and Muslim Traditions''. (Saarsbruck: 2008), pp. 227-28.</ref>

==== Alternate views ====
It is written by the Royal Central Asian Society in the ''[[Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society]]'' that the struggle between Rostam and the [[Div-e Sepid]] "White Demon" represents a struggle between Persians and invaders from the [[Northern Iran|northern Caspian provinces]].<ref>''Journal of the Royal Central Asian Society'' By Royal Central Asian Society</ref>

=== Death ===
{{main|Rostam and Shaghad}}
In Shahnameh, the life spans of the heroes who are from the generation of [[Sām|Sam Yale]] (Rostam's grandfather) are described as being very long, and that of Rostam fits this pattern: he has reached the age of six hundred at the time of his death by violence (dying at the hand of his envious half-brother Shaghad, who kills him by throwing him into a well full of poisoned spears). In this incident, Rostam's faithful steed Rakhsh and the hero's brother, [[Zavara|Zavareh]] are also killed.

== Descent and other relations ==
[[File:Rustam reçu par le roi Keykavouss.jpg|thumb|Rostam and [[Kay Kavus]] in castle]]
With [[Tahmineh]], princess of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], Rostam had a son called [[Sohrab]], who was killed accidentally by his father in the time of [[Kay Kavus]]. In [[Banu Goshasp Nama]] Rostam later had a daughter called [[Banu Goshasp]], who had a full brother called [[Faramarz]], and both became renowned heroes in Turan and India. Goshasp, through her marriage with [[Shahnameh|Giv]] had a son, [[Bijan and Manijeh|Bijan]].

Rostam had also a half brother called [[Shaghad]], who was always jealous of him and provoked his death.

Just as famous as Rostam was his horse [[Rakhsh]], which had an incredibly long life like Rostam, due to divine protection, and died at the same time as Rostam.

== Historical basis ==
[[Ernst Herzfeld]] maintained that the dynasty of [[Gondophares]] represented the [[House of Suren]], highest of the five premier families of [[Parthian Empire]], invested with the hereditary right of [[Spahbed|commanding the royal armies]], and placing the crown on the king's head at the coronation. Probably when around 129 BCE, nomad peoples, especially the [[Indo-Scythians]] (''Sacaraucae'', [[Old Persian]] ''Sakaravaka'' "nomadic [[Saka]]” or Saraucae) and the [[Tocharians]] attacked the eastern frontier of [[Parthia]], defense was entrusted by the Parthian emperors to the Surens; and the latter eventually not only repelled the Indo-Scythians, but pursued them into [[Arachosia]] and the [[Punjab]], this event probably representing ''interitus Saraucarum'' ( the perishing of the Sacaraucae) of [[Gnaeus Pompeius Trogus]] (Prologue 42).

Echoes of these events are preserved in the legends of the Sistān cycle, partly incorporated in the ''Shahnameh'', but once also surviving as independent epics, such as the [[Garshaspname|''Garšāspnāma'']] mentioned in the [[Tarikh-i Sistan|''Tārikh-e Sistān'']], and the ''Ketāb al-Sakisarān'' cited by [[al-Masudi]]. These related the deeds of the hero [[Garshasp]] and his descendants, [[Nariman (father of Sām)|Narimān]], Sām, Zāl or Dastān, and above all of the latter's son Rostam. It is difficult to relate the [[Indo-Parthian]] names known from coins and history to those of the epic, which are possibly honorific titles, since a recently reported silver coin describes Gondophares (spelt in Greek script Hyndopharres) as ''surnamed'' Sām. A single ruler may of course have received more than one such title, and the historical names may be repeated in succeeding generations.<ref name=GONDOPHARES>{{Iranica |gondophares}}</ref>
