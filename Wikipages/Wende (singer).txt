'''Wende Snijders''', known [[:wikt:mononym|mononymously]] as '''Wende''' (born 10 October 1978 in [[Beckenham]], Greater London) is a Dutch singer.

==Biography==
Wende moved to [[Indonesia]] when she was four years old and to [[Guinea-Bissau]] when she was six. When she was nine, she went to the [[Netherlands]], where she lived in [[Zeist]].

In 2001 she won first prize and the audience award of the [[Concours de la Chanson]], which was held in [[De Kleine Komedie]] in Amsterdam and organized by [[Alliance Française]]. Her first album ''[[Quand tu dors]]'' was released in 2005 and won an [[Edison Award]] in the category Easy Listening/Cabaret. She also won in 2005 the Zonta-Award (a prize for talented woman artists younger than 30) and the BAT prize (potential theatre talent). For the DVD ''[[Au suivant]]'' she received an Edison in 2006 in the category National Music DVD. The corresponding cd was nominated for an Edison in the category Listening song/Cabaret.

Her second album ''[[La Fille Noyée]]'' was released in 2006. Contrary to the previous album, this album did not contain merely French chansons, but also songs in Dutch. This album also won an Edison in 2007.

In 2007 she performed with Jenny Arean -among others- in the play ''[[Het Verschil]]'' (The Difference). There is a limited edition of this play on CD.
On 22 March she sang with the Hungarian artist [[Yonderboi]] for the Dutch queen during the celebration of 50 years of European collaboration. She also won the [[Gouden Notenkraker]] in 2007.

On 25 August 2007 her act at the annual [[Uitmarkt]] in Amsterdam was live on Dutch television. In the season 2007/08 she toured with her new show "Adem" (Breath), which she presented at the [[Oerol]] festival.

On 7 November 2007 she won another Edison, this time the Edison Jazz Award.

On 27 April 2008 Wende received the [[Annie M.G. Schmidt Prize]] for her theatre song ''De Wereld Beweegt'' (The World is Moving).
