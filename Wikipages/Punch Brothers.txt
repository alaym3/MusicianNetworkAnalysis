==History==
===2006–2007: Beginnings===
Thile formed the band in 2006 to record the album ''[[How to Grow a Woman from the Ground]]''. In an interview with the ''Nashville City Paper'', Thile described the formation of the band:

{{quote|We got together one night just to drop a ton of money, drink too much wine, eat steaks, and commiserate about our failed relationships. We had gotten to play together a few days before and we had said that we needed to do something musical together. With our hearts smashed to pieces, it became more urgent — our lives had gone the same way for so long. I knew I wanted to have a band with Gabe [Witcher], but I didn’t know if it would be a rock ensemble, an ambitious acoustic classical thing or a bluegrass group. We played, and there was a serious, instantaneous connection. Then I knew I wanted to put together a bluegrass band — one with a lot of range, but aesthetically a bluegrass band.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section=12&screen=news&news_id=51705  | title = Nickel Creek’s Thile ‘grows’ a new band | newspaper = Nashville City Paper | date = 2006-08-23 | access-date = 2007-10-13 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060826212803/http://nashvillecitypaper.com/index.cfm?section=12&screen=news&news_id=51705 |archive-date = 2006-08-26}}</ref>
}}

The band was initially known as '''The How to Grow a Band'''. In 2007, they officially changed their name, first to '''The Tensions Mountain Boys''', before settling on Punch Brothers. The band's name comes from the critical line of an [[earworm]] [[A Literary Nightmare#The jingle|jingle]] that is the centerpiece of [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain's]] short story "[[A Literary Nightmare]]".<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.amazon.com/Punch-Brothers/dp/B0010YO8M6 | title = Punch Brothers: Punch | publisher = Amazon.com | access-date = 2010-04-23}}</ref> The chorus of the jingle consists of two lines, "Punch, brothers! punch with care! Punch in the presence of the passenjare," which are said to be the mantra of railroad conductors.

What they formed was a type of group that ''[[American Songwriter]]'' magazine calls "A 21st century version of the [[Bill Monroe|Bluegrass Boys]]."<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.americansongwriter.com/2012/05/punch-brothers-american-pickers/ | title = Punch Brothers: American Pickers|magazine=[[American Songwriter]]|access-date=31 May 2012}}</ref>

===2007–2009: "The Blind Leaving the Blind" and ''Punch''===
[[File:Chris Thile 2008 2.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Chris Thile and Punch Brothers at Wintergrass, 2008]]
On March 17, 2007, this group debuted the ambitious forty-minute suite, "The Blind Leaving the Blind" at Carnegie Hall. The piece was composed by Thile, who said he wrote it in part to deal with his divorce in 2003.

On February 13, 2008, the band set off on their first national tour as Punch Brothers. On February 26, they released ''[[Punch (album)|Punch]]'', their first album, on [[Nonesuch Records]]. The album features Thile's suite "The Blind Leaving the Blind", as well as other original songs.<ref>{{cite magazine | url = http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=15490 | title = Nonesuch Records Signs Singer/Composer/Mandolinist Chris Thile and His New Band, Punch Brothers | magazine = All About Jazz | date = 2007-10-09 | access-date = 2007-10-10 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225112354/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/news.php?id=15490 | archive-date = 2007-12-25 }}</ref>

In March 2008, when asked about a follow-up album, Thile said "there will definitely be another album."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2008/04/05/now_out_of_the_creek_thiles_packing_punch/ |title=Now out of the Creek, Thile's packing Punch - The Boston Globe |publisher=Boston.com |date=2008-04-05 |access-date=2015-03-18}}</ref> On November 8, 2008, the band announced on their website that they had parted ways with bass player Greg Garrison. Paul Kowert, who studied under [[Edgar Meyer]] at the Curtis Institute of Music, took Garrison's place as bass player.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://punchbrothers.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&ac=0&Itemid=41/ |title=Punch Brothers |publisher=Punchbrothers.com |access-date=2015-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417023902/http://punchbrothers.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=45&ac=0&Itemid=41%2F |archive-date=2018-04-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===2010: ''Antifogmatic''===
''[[Antifogmatic]]'', Punch Brothers' second album, was released on June 15, 2010 and features both traditional bluegrass and newgrass styles on the ten-track listing. Though bassist Kowert had toured extensively with the band in support of ''[[Punch (album)|Punch]]'' over the preceding two years, ''Antifogmatic'' is the first Punch Brothers album on which he appears.

===2011: ''How to Grow A Band'' documentary===
The band is also the focus of the documentary ''[[How to Grow a Band]]'', directed by Mark Meatto. It was filmed over a two-year period and, according to its website, "explores the tensions between individual talents and group identity, art and commerce, youth and wisdom". The film premiered at the 42nd [[Nashville Film Festival]] in Nashville, Tennessee on April 15, 2011. The film also screened as part of the 38th Annual [[Telluride Bluegrass Festival]] in June 2011.

===2012: ''Who's Feeling Young Now?''===
The band released its third album, ''[[Who's Feeling Young Now?]]'', in February 2012. Shortly afterwards, they contributed the song 'Dark Days' to the soundtrack for 2012 blockbuster ''[[The Hunger Games (film)|The Hunger Games]]''. In November 2012 they released ''Ahoy!'', the 5-track EP companion to ''Who's Feeling Young Now?'' The EP consists of five songs that were not featured on the full-length release.

===2015: ''The Phosphorescent Blues'' and ''The Wireless''===
In November 2014, the band released the first single, entitled "I Blew It Off," from their then-untitled fourth album. In December 2014, the band announced that the new album, ''[[The Phosphorescent Blues]]'', would be released on January 27, 2015, along with the immediate release of another new single, "Julep".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punchbrothers.com/news/the-phosphorescent-blues-pre-order-now/ |title=The Phosphorescent Blues – Pre-Order Now |publisher=Punchbrothers.com |date=2014-12-04 |access-date=2015-03-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330084724/http://www.punchbrothers.com/news/the-phosphorescent-blues-pre-order-now/ |archive-date=2016-03-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Julep was nominated for Best American Roots Song at the 2016 Grammy Awards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://theboot.com/2016-grammy-awards-nominees/|title=2016 Grammy Awards Nominees Announced|website=The Boot|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-06}}</ref> The album reached the top 10 on the rock, folk, and bluegrass charts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/punch-brothers-band-on-bluegrass-collaboration-and-how-they-met/ |title=Punch Brothers on bluegrass, collaboration and the band's "instant mind meld" |last=Mason |first=Anthony |date=2018-07-28 |website=CBSNews.com |access-date=2018-07-30}}</ref> On November 20, 2015, Punch Brothers released a 5-track [[Extended play|EP]], ''The Wireless''.

=== 2018: ''All Ashore'' ===
On July 20, 2018, ''[[All Ashore (Punch Brothers album)|All Ashore]]'' was released as the band's fifth album. The album was self-produced and released on the [[Nonesuch Records]] label.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8466370/chris-thile-interview-punch-brothers|title=Chris Thile Talks Strumming Through the Apocalypse With Punch Brothers|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-31}}</ref> According to Thile, the album is "a meditation on committed relationships in the present day, particularly in light of the current unsettled political climate—certainly the most unsettled one that anyone in the band has ever experienced. We were hoping we could create a thing that would be convincing as a complete thought, sort of a nine-movement or a nine-song thought, even though it's rangy in terms of what it's talking about and in the characters doing the talking."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nonesuch.com/journal/story-behind-punch-brothers-new-album-all-ashore-2018-07-16|title=The Story Behind Punch Brothers' New Album, "All Ashore" - Nonesuch Records|website=Nonesuch Records Official Website|language=en|access-date=2018-07-20}}</ref>

''All Ashore'' was awarded the [[Grammy Award for Best Folk Album]] at the 61st Grammy Awards on February 10, 2019.<ref name=":0" />
