===Name origin===
Himanshu Suri stated in an interview:
{{cquote|I think being minorities at a liberal arts college and that type of environment had an impact on both the way we view race and our sense of humor, which people often use as a tool to deal with race. I always felt like ''[[Wonder Showzen]]'' was a television show that captured that type of thing perfectly. When I saw the little kid yelling "THAT'S RACIST" it blew my mind. And then it became a game...to take all the seriousness out of making legitimate commentary on race, because that can get very annoying. So when something veering on racially insensitive would pop off in a commercial on television or something it would be like, who could yell "That's Racist" first. And then we thought it would be a cool name. [[Das EFX]] may have been an inspiration.<ref name=musc108/>}}

In July 2012, Das Racist signed a deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony]]/[[Megaforce Records]] for their next album,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/chrisbarth/2012/09/05/from-wall-street-headhunter-to-indie-rap-mogul-das-racists-himanshu-suri/|title=From Wall Street Headhunter To Indie Rap Mogul: Das Racist's Himanshu Suri|author=Chris Barth|work=[[Forbes]]|date=September 5, 2012|access-date=September 5, 2012}}</ref> and shortly thereafter, their song "Girl" appeared in a commercial for [[Kmart]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://whatsongisinthatcommercial.com/hey-girl-kmart-wants-you-to-gasp-over-their-layaway-and-gets-das-racist-to-help/|title=Hey Girl – Kmart wants you to gasp over their layaway and gets Das Racist to help|author=Linda|date=October 9, 2012|publisher=What Song is in that Commercial?|access-date=October 10, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012044658/http://whatsongisinthatcommercial.com/hey-girl-kmart-wants-you-to-gasp-over-their-layaway-and-gets-das-racist-to-help/|archive-date=October 12, 2012}}</ref>

===Break up===
In December 2012, Heems announced to a crowd at the On3 Festival in Munich that Das Racist had broken up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.br.de/on3/musik/aktuell/musiknews-feed-artikel-100.html#n1|title=Are Das Racist splitting up?|publisher=[[Bayerischer Rundfunk]]|date=December 2, 2012|access-date=December 2, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120032907/http://www.br.de/on3/musik/aktuell/musiknews-feed-artikel-100.html#n1|archive-date=November 20, 2012}}</ref> In response, Kool A.D. tweeted that he had left the band two months prior but had been keeping his departure under wraps.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/48790-das-racist-breaking-up/|title=Das Racist Break Up|author=Evan Minsker |date=December 2, 2012|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=December 2, 2012 }}</ref> The breakup came after they had signed a record deal and were to release a "proper album", followed by a tour. Dapwell told Spin, "We had a plan to break up around May. We had just signed this record deal and we were going to put out one proper album and then go on a farewell tour, release a proper breaking up statement that could have been really funny, maybe a weird, stupid video. Now, all of that has gone to shit."<ref>{{cite news |title=Das Racist Breaks Up : New York Music News|url=http://nymn.com/das-racist-breaks-up-new-york-music-news/|work= New York Music News |date= December 3, 2012 |access-date= December 3, 2012}}</ref> Speaking to ''Rolling Stone'', Vazquez said he and Suri had been "trying to do slightly different things" professionally and artistically.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Flanary|first1=Patrick|title=Das Racist's Victor 'Kool A.D.'

Following the break-up both Suri and Vazquez both continued to make rap music. Heems released two mixtapes called "Nehru Jackets" and "Wild Water Kingdom." Both mixtapes continued his work with Queens producer Mike Finito, among other producers such as Keyboard Kid and Lushlife. Vazquez began a very prolific solo career after the break-up. Beyond his visual art, Vazquez played live shows in support of his mixtapes "51," "19," and "63." The three tapes, named after former bus lines in the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] area, feature production from the likes of Amaze88 and Trackademicks.

Dapwell stayed busy as well, working full-time on an active Twitter feed, as well as producing a podcast with his comedian brother, Hari Kondabolu. He also co-hosts the radio show [http://www.chillinisland.com/ Chillin' Island with Despot], and has two separate comedic television shows in development.

==Work in other media==
With a growing repertoire of work in media beyond music, Das Racist have been referred to as a "multimedia art project".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitch.com/2011-03-24/music/das-racist/?|title=Das Racist, the Internet's favorite prankster, is stronger and smarter than you'd think|author=Corban Goble|date=March 22, 2011|access-date=April 22, 2011|work=The Pitch}}{{Dead link|date=July 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> At the end of 2010, ''Pitchfork'' honored "everything Das Racist did this year", calling attention to a column Suri wrote for ''[[Stereogum]]'' about the sitcom ''[[Outsourced (TV series)|Outsourced]]'', their interview with ''[[The New York Times]]'' [[Deborah Solomon]], and their appearance on "Our Show With Elliot Aronow" in which they stated that [[Lady Gaga]] was "clearly [[Illuminati]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7893-the-top-50-albums-of-2010/3/|author=Nate Patrin|date=December 16, 2010|title=The Top 50 Albums of 2010|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

After [[Sasha Frere-Jones]] wrote a piece in ''The New Yorker'' on the demise of hip hop in late 2009, the blog ''Flavorpill'' turned to Das Racist to provide a response; Vazquez and Suri took Frere-Jones to task for presumptuously claiming authority on the matter, questioning Frere-Jones's assumptions and conclusions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flavorwire.com/45316/das-racist-to-sasha-frere-jones-stop-trying-to-kill-rap|title=Das Racist to Sasha Frere-Jones: "Stop trying to kill rap."|author=Caroline Stanley|date=October 23, 2009|publisher=Flavorpill|access-date=October 24, 2009}}</ref>

In December 2009, Das Racist hosted "Minority Fest". The event, curated by  the Kondabolu Brothers, featured [[Victor Varnado]], [[Jay Smooth]], [[Kumail Nanjiani]], [[Ali Wong]] and [[Hari Kondabolu]] among others, consisted of stand-up comedy by comedians of color (many of whom went onto superstardom), musical performances, and a panel discussion concerning issues faced by [[people of color]] in the arts.<ref name=courant/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://dasracist.net/?p=5|title=MinorityFest 2009|author=Das Racist|access-date=February 9, 2010|date=December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116113831/http://dasracist.net/?p=5|archive-date=January 16, 2010}}</ref>

In the build-up to releasing ''Relax'', Das Racist hosted a radio show on [[East Village Radio]] called "Chillin' Island".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/das-racist-to-debut-new-music-on-east-village-radi/55249/|title=Das Racist To Debut New Music on East Village Radio Residency|author=Andrew Martin|date=August 10, 2011|access-date=September 21, 2011|work=Prefix}}</ref> After releasing ''Relax'', Dap turned "Chillin' Island" into a video web series starring himself and co-hosted and produced by Heems and the rapper Despot.<ref name=treats>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/44041-das-racist-shenaniganstreats-abound/|title=Das Racist Shenanigans/Treats Abound|author=David Bevan|date=September 19, 2011|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=September 21, 2011}}</ref>    

The show, produced by Elara Pictures and DreamCrew, is currently being developed into a television series by Spotify starring Dap, Lakutis, and Despot.

We dabble with [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]]s, [[dadaism]], [[repetition (rhetorical device)|repetition]], repetition. We make dance music while talking about not-dancey things. We say things that on the surface can seem pretty dumb but it's a mask on some [[Paul Laurence Dunbar]] shit for actual discontent with a lot of shit in the world. Further, not a lot of people want to hear rappers talk about [[Dinesh D'Souza]] being a punk, [[Edward Said|Eddie Said]], [[Gayatri Spivak]] being dope or even know who they are. A lot of people hear ''Pizza Hut Taco Bell'' and then have preconceived notions about our entire body of work that fall pretty flat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sepiamutiny.com/sepia/archives/005957.html|title=Q&A with Himanshu Suri of Das Racist: Part II|author=Philly Grrl|date=September 21, 2009|publisher=[[Sepia Mutiny]]|access-date=2009-10-19}}</ref></blockquote>
