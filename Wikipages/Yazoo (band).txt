'''Yazoo''' (known as '''Yaz''' in North America) were an English [[synth-pop]] duo from [[Basildon]], [[Essex]], consisting of former [[Depeche Mode]] member [[Vince Clarke]] (keyboards) and [[Alison Moyet]] (vocals).<ref name="greatrock">{{Citation |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |author-link=Martin C. Strong |year=1998 |title=The Great Rock Discography |publisher=Giunti |page=935 |isbn=88-09-21522-2}}</ref> The duo formed in late 1981 after Clarke responded to an advertisement Moyet placed in a British music magazine, although the pair had known each other since their schooldays.

Over the next 18 months the duo released two albums, ''[[Upstairs at Eric's]]'' and ''[[You and Me Both]]'', which received critical acclaim for their production, particularly the blending of Clarke's synthesizer melodies with Moyet's [[blues]]- and [[Soul music|soul]]-influenced vocals. 

Yazoo enjoyed worldwide success, particularly in their home country, where three of their four singles reached the top three of the [[UK Singles Chart]] and both their albums made the top two of the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name="BritishHit Singles">{{cite book |editor-first=David  | editor-last=Roberts |title=British Hit Singles & Albums |publisher=Guinness World Records Ltd |location=London, England |page=613 |edition=19th |year=2006 |isbn=978-1-904994-10-7|title-link=British Hit Singles & Albums }}</ref> In North America, they are known for the song "[[Situation (song)|Situation]]", which, though originally only a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] in the United Kingdom, was a club and airplay success in the United States and Canada before being released as the band's debut single in North America.

Despite their success, the duo split acrimoniously in May 1983 as a result of a combination of Clarke's reluctance to make more records under the Yazoo name, a [[clash of personalities]], and a lack of communication between the pair.<ref name="Times20080418">{{cite news |first=Pete |last=Paphides |author-link= Peter Paphides |title=Back with his other Alf: Vince Clarke and Alison Moyet reunite for Yazoo |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=London, England |date=18 April 2008}}</ref><ref name= "Quietus20110504">{{cite web |first=Nix |last=Lowrey |title=Alison Moyet Interviewed: Only You – The Story & End of Yazoo |work=[[The Quietus]] |url= http://thequietus.com/articles/06189-alison-moyet-interview-yazoo |date=4 May 2011 |access-date=6 December 2013}}</ref><ref name= "Indy20080608">{{cite news |first=Kate |last=Burt |title=How We Met: Alison Moyet & Vince Clarke |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/how-we-met-alison-moyet--vince-clarke-840984.html |newspaper=[[The Independent]] |date=8 June 2008 |access-date=11 June 2008 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080611032013/http://www.independent.co.uk/extras/sunday-review/regulars/how-we-met-alison-moyet--vince-clarke-840984.html |archive-date=11 June 2008}}</ref> 

Clarke went on to form [[Erasure]], another successful and longer-lasting synth-pop duo, while Moyet embarked on a highly successful solo career. Although their musical career was short, Yazoo's combination of electronic instrumentation and soulful female vocals has been cited as an influence on the [[house music]] scene that emerged in the mid-1980s,<ref name="Times20080418" /> as well as on bands such as [[LCD Soundsystem]] (who name-checked the duo on their debut single "[[Losing My Edge]]"), [[Hercules and Love Affair]] (whose leader Andy Butler has said that "Situation" was his biggest musical inspiration as a child),<ref name="Times20080418" /><ref>{{cite web |first=Robin |last=Murray |title= Personality Clash: Vince Clarke vs Andy Butler |url= http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/personality-clash-vince-clarke-yazoo-vs-andy-butler-hercules-and-love-affair |work=[[Clash (magazine)|Clash]] |date=2 January 2010 |access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> [[La Roux]], [[Shiny Toy Guns]] and [[Blaqk Audio]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Still inspiring after all these years |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ow4EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA93 |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=93 |volume=119 |issue=41 |date=13 October 2007}}</ref>

In 2008, 25 years after splitting, Clarke and Moyet reconciled and reformed Yazoo to play a successful tour of the UK, Europe and North America in support of the reissue of Yazoo's two studio albums and a [[box set]], ''[[In Your Room (Yazoo album)|In Your Room]]'' of their material. The pair briefly reunited in May 2011 to play three Yazoo songs at a music festival organised by their record label.

==History==

===Formation and ''Upstairs at Eric's'' (1982)===
Clarke and Moyet grew up in Basildon and attended the same Saturday music school when they were eleven years old.<ref name="Indy20080608"/> Clarke became interested in [[electronic music]] after hearing [[Metropolitan Borough of Wirral|Wirral]] synth band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] (OMD), and later co-founded Depeche Mode.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/erasure-vince-clarke-2020-interview-2648175250.html|title=Synthpop King Vince Clarke on Erasure's 18th Studio Album, 'The Neon'|last=Shand|first=Max|date=12 October 2020|website=[[PopMatters]]|access-date=3 March 2021|quote=[OMD] were such a huge influence on me. The reason I got into electronic music was because I heard the track 'Almost'. That's when I thought to myself, oh my God, electronic music actually has some emotion, and I wanted to do that, be a part of that.}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |title=Erasure |series=[[The O-Zone]] |network=[[BBC 2]] |station=[[BBC]] |airdate=29 November 1995 |minutes=8 |quote=When I was 18 or 19 I heard a single called 'Electricity' by Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark. It sounded so different from anything I'd heard; that really made me want to make electronic music, 'cause it was so unique.}}</ref> Moyet spent her teens singing in various [[punk rock|punk]] and blues bands in her home town. She placed an advert in the UK weekly music magazine ''[[Melody Maker]]'' in late 1981 asking for musicians to form a "rootsy" blues band after her most recent group, the Screamin' Ab Dabs, had broken up.<ref name="Quietus20110504"/><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Classifieds|magazine=[[Melody Maker]]|page=34|date=14 November 1981}} "Brilliant female vocalist, experienced gigs/studio, seeks great rootsy soul/R&B band.—Alison, Basildon"</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|first=Neil|last=Tennant|author-link=Neil Tennant|title=Yazoo!|magazine=[[Smash Hits]]|pages=4–5|date=13 May 1982}}</ref>

Moyet was surprised when the only reply she received was from Clarke, who had recently stunned the music press by quitting Depeche Mode after their debut album and three hit singles, all of which he had written. Despite growing up nearby, Moyet and Clarke did not know each other. Moyet had been in the same class at school as Clarke's future Depeche Mode bandmates [[Martin Gore]] and [[Andy Fletcher (musician)|Andy Fletcher]]<ref>{{cite web|first=Ian|last=Wade|title=Changeling: Alison Moyet Interviewed|work=The Quietus|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/12247-alison-moyet-interview|date=16 May 2013|access-date=6 December 2013}}</ref> but had no contact with Clarke himself, remembering him as an outsider who, with his brothers, would wear t-shirts proclaiming their Christianity.

Clarke had seen Moyet sing live a few times, as his best friend had been in her punk band.<ref name="Quietus20110504"/> Aware of her vocal abilities, he was looking for someone to sing on a demo of a song he had written called "[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]". Clarke was worried that by walking out of Depeche Mode he would lose his record deal with [[Mute Records]] and wanted to show the label that he still had something to offer them, saying in a 2008 interview, "When I left Depeche I wasn't sure I'd still have a record deal and was keen to play the label something of my own, so I wrote the song 'Only You' but needed someone to demo it with. Alison happened to be advertising in a local paper so I called her."<ref name="Indy20080608" />

The pair came to the project with different tastes in music. In an early interview, Moyet stated that "I'm a traditionalist, I can't accept the fact of blues with synthesizers at all," while Clarke admitted to tolerating modern [[rhythm & blues|R&B]] outfits like [[Dr. Feelgood (band)|Dr. Feelgood]] but disliked traditional blues artists such as [[Muddy Waters]].<ref>{{cite magazine|first=Chris|last=Bohn|title=Blues a la Mode|magazine=[[NME]]|page=4 |date=17 April 1982}}</ref> Clarke took the demo to Mute label boss [[Daniel Miller (music producer)|Daniel Miller]] but recalled that at first Miller appeared to be uninterested: "I tried to give it to Daniel and he didn't show much interest&nbsp;... I brought it in and put it on, and the whole time it was playing, Daniel was messing around with a synthesizer. He said he liked it, but carried on doing what he was doing—and that was it. Only when the publishers took an interest did he brighten up."<ref name="Times20080418"/> Mute asked the duo to record the song as a single and to make an album together. By this point Clarke had already written "[[Don't Go (Yazoo song)|Don't Go]]", but both he and Moyet felt it was too good to be the B-side of "Only You", so they quickly wrote the song "Situation" together for the single's B-side.<ref name="Quietus20110504"/>

According to Moyet, the name Yazoo was taken from the specialist blues record label [[Yazoo Records]].<ref name="lawsuit-name">{{Citation|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|year=2004|title=Stripped: Depeche Mode|publisher=Omnibus Press|page=128|isbn=1-84449-415-2}}</ref> 
This decision led to a £3.5&nbsp;million lawsuit threat by the label over the band's name<ref name="lawsuit-name"/> and, coupled with the fact that the name Yazoo was already in use by a small American rock band, the group was renamed Yaz for the North American market.<ref name="greatrock"/>

"Only You" was released in the UK in March 1982 and rose to number two on the UK singles chart.<ref name="BritishHit Singles"/> The duo recorded their debut album at [[Blackwing Studios]] in southeast London, where Clarke had recorded Depeche Mode's album ''[[Speak & Spell (album)|Speak & Spell]]'' the previous year. As the studio had already been booked during the day by fellow Mute artist [[Fad Gadget]], Yazoo recorded most of the album during the early mornings.<ref name="Quietus20120823">{{cite web |first=John |last=Freeman |title=Synthesizer Soul: Yazoo's Upstairs At Eric's 30 Years On |url=http://thequietus.com/articles/09800-yazoo-upstairs-at-erics |work=The Quietus |date=23 August 2012 |access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> Clarke had expected that Miller would produce the album, but discovered that Miller was already otherwise occupied, so Blackwing studio owner [[Eric Radcliffe]] carried out production duties with Clarke and Moyet. The album was named ''Upstairs at Eric's'' in recognition of Radcliffe's input.<ref name="Quietus20120823" />

"Don't Go" was released in July 1982 as the second single in the UK and also reached the top three of the UK charts.<ref name="BritishHit Singles"/> In North America, "Situation" had been a hit in the clubs in a version remixed by New York City-based DJ [[François Kevorkian]], and against the band's wishes, it was released as Yazoo's debut single in the US and Canada, where it reached number 73 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "Only You" was released as Yazoo's second single in North America and reached number 67.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yaz Chart History – Hot 100 |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/yaz/chart-history/hot-100 |access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref>

''Upstairs at Eric's'' was released in the UK in August 1982, peaking at number two on the UK Albums Chart<ref name="BritishHit Singles" /> and going on to sell more than 300,000 copies and achieving platinum status.<ref name="BPI">{{cite web |title=BPI Awards – Certified Awards Search |url=https://www.bpi.co.uk/bpi-awards/ |access-date=8 March 2018}} Type "Yazoo" into "Search BPI Awards" box and press "Enter".</ref> In the US, initial success was more modest and the album peaked at number 92 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] album chart,<ref name="Billboard200">{{cite web |title=Yaz Chart History – Billboard 200 |url=https://www.billboard.com/music/yaz/chart-history/billboard-200 |access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> but by 1989, seven years after its release, word of mouth had helped to push the album to platinum status for sales of over one million copies.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum – RIAA |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=yaz&ti=upstairs+at+eric%27s&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section |access-date=8 March 2018}}</ref> The duo played 24 dates in support of the album across Europe and North America.

===''You and Me Both'' and disbandment (1983)===
After releasing "[[The Other Side of Love]]" in the UK in November 1982, a non-album stopgap single that reached number 13 in the UK singles chart,<ref name="BritishHit Singles" /> the duo went back to Blackwing to record their second album. However, by now there was growing tension between the pair. Clarke had always seen ''Upstairs at Eric's'' as a one-off project and had to be persuaded to make another Yazoo record by his publishers, who felt it would not go down well if he was seen to walk out of a second band within a year of the first.<ref name="Quietus20110504" /> Compounding this were issues of self-esteem for Moyet. At only 21 years of age, she was struggling to come to terms with being in the spotlight and the pressures of sudden fame, and she resented the fact that Clarke was leaving her to carry out all the promotional work for the records by herself.<ref name="MM19830625">{{cite magazine |first=Paul |last=Colbert |title=Diary of a Somebody |magazine=Melody Maker |pages=24–25 |date=25 June 1983}}</ref> Unlike their first record, the second album was made over a longer period of four months and with Clarke and Moyet rarely in the studio together at the same time; Clarke would record instrumental tracks in the morning and Moyet would come in during the evening and record her vocals.<ref name="Quietus20110504" />

A single, "[[Nobody's Diary]]", was released in May 1983 ahead of the album and reached number three in the UK chart,<ref name="BritishHit Singles" /> but within days of the single's release, Yazoo announced that they were splitting up.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=NME |page=2|title=Yazoo to split |date=21 May 1983}}</ref> The album, ironically titled ''You and Me Both'', was released in the UK in July 1983 and topped the UK album charts,<ref name="BritishHit Singles" /> a feat it would also achieve in New Zealand. However, with no further singles or live appearances to promote it, it did not sell as well as ''Upstairs at Eric's'', although it still achieved gold status in the UK for sales of 100,000 copies.<ref name="BPI" /> In the US, ''You and Me Both'' peaked at number 69 on the ''Billboard'' 200.<ref name="Billboard200" />

Reflecting in 2008 on the group's split, both Moyet and Clarke agreed that a lack of communication between the pair had been a major reason for the breakdown of the partnership. Moyet recalled that Clarke "was creatively very encouraging, very open to hearing my ideas for songs. The thing I found difficult was the lack of warmth. I wanted to feel more likeable, and you can't feel likeable if someone doesn't want to interact with you." Clarke admitted that "I lacked the life-skills of communication in a relationship. I felt confident in the studio, but starting a chat with somebody&nbsp;..."<ref name="Times20080418" /> He put it down to the fact that because the duo became popular so rapidly, there had never been any time to build up a personal relationship between them: "It all happened very fast and because we hadn't been in a band for years, playing in clubs, it was very much just a working relationship—we never had the chance to bond. We never really knew each other. Not really&nbsp;... The fact that we never talked, never socialised together, meant that when problems came up we didn't know how to communicate and sort things out." Moyet added that their differing personalities had not helped matters, saying, "He was, I think, sad at the time after leaving Depeche and remote, a bit angry, but it was all internalised. Whereas I was this disaffected, slightly aggressive ex-punk rocker where nothing was internalised. I was probably quite difficult to be around."<ref name="Indy20080608" />

===Legacy===
Following Yazoo's split, Clarke formed [[the Assembly]] with [[Eric Radcliffe]]. Intending to record a series of one-off singles featuring different vocalists, in the end the Assembly produced just one single, "[[Never Never (The Assembly song)|Never Never]]" with [[Feargal Sharkey]], before also splitting up. Around this time, Clarke also produced the album ''[[The Peter Pan Effect]]'' for singer [[Robert Marlow]], an old friend of both his and Moyet's. Clarke then teamed up with singer [[Andy Bell (singer)|Andy Bell]] to form the successful synth-pop duo Erasure. Moyet spent several months out of the limelight before signing a deal with [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]] and embarking on a successful solo career.

"Situation" was finally released as a single in the UK in 1990 in another remixed form, which was moderately successful, reaching number 14 on the UK singles chart. A compilation entitled ''[[Only Yazoo|Only Yazoo: The Best of]]'' was released in 1999 and was preceded by a re-release of Yazoo's debut single, "Only You", featuring a new remix of the title track and several more of "Don't Go". The band's output was book-ended with yet another release of "Situation", accompanied by many remixes. Clarke was tapped to remix Moyet's 1994 single "Whispering Your Name" and, with Erasure, Clarke and Moyet tried to record her single "This House" as a duet, but the project was never realized because [[Sony Music Entertainment]] would not permit it.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The band's songs have appeared in a number of films and television shows. In 1988, "In My Room", "Ode to Boy" and "Only You" were used in the film ''[[The Chocolate War]]'' (an adaption of the book of the same title). "Only You" was used in the film ''[[Napoleon Dynamite]]'', the BBC television series ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'', the film ''[[Can't Hardly Wait]]'', the ''[[Fringe (TV series)|Fringe]]'' episode "[[Transilience Thought Unifier Model-11]]", ''[[The Americans]]'' episode "Dimebag" and several episodes of "Once Upon a Time" [Season 5]. A [[cover version]] of "Only You" by Joshua Radin was used in 2007 in a [[J. C. Penney]] commercial. Another cover of "Only You" was recorded by Selena Gomez for the 2017 Netflix television show [[13 Reasons Why]]. "Don't Go" appeared in the BBC series ''[[I'm Alan Partridge]]'' and was used in the film ''[[Tango and Cash]]''. The song "Situation" was used in the 1990 TV movie ''Exile'' and was also used in a [[Nintendo]] commercial highlighting the classic edition of the [[Game Boy Advance SP]] and the NES games ported to it. In 2007, "Bring Your Love Down (Didn't I)" was used in ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' episode "[[List of The Sarah Silverman Program episodes|Not Without My Daughter]]".{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

[[Anohni]], lead vocalist of [[Antony & The Johnsons|Antony & the Johnsons]], talked with [[Terry Gross]] in February 2009 about recording the debut self-titled [[Hercules & Love Affair]] album. She said she had been asked by New York-based DJ Andy Butler to join the project and that the objective was (or became) "Let's sound as much like Yazoo as we can&nbsp;... We loved Yazoo."<ref name="npr">{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=100162285|title=Antony Hegarty's Otherworldly Sound|website=NPR.org}}</ref>

===2008 reunion and 'Reconnected' tour===
[[File:Yazoo (band) 2008.06.21 005.jpg|270px|thumb|right|Alison Moyet with Yazoo in 2008]]
Despite the long estrangement, Moyet had always harboured plans to perform the songs from ''You and Me Both'' live on stage, something that had never occurred, as the duo had split before the album was released. Toward the end of 2007, she had finished promoting her album ''[[The Turn (Alison Moyet album)|The Turn]]'' and had no immediate plans for more solo work, and aware that Mute were planning to issue remastered versions of Yazoo's albums, she e-mailed Clarke to see if he was interested in the idea of a reunion. 

Clarke welcomed her message, but replied that he was now committed to his current band Erasure and felt it would be disloyal to his musical partner Andy Bell if he returned to work with Moyet. However, shortly afterwards Bell told Clarke that he wanted to take a break from Erasure, causing Clarke to reconsider Moyet's proposal, and with a message sent via Mute label head Daniel Miller, he indicated that he was open to reuniting for live performances. Clarke disclosed that he had felt obliged to ask Bell if he had any objections to Clarke performing with Yazoo again: Bell's response had simply been to ask Clarke for tickets for the reunion shows.<ref name="Times20080418" /><ref name="Quietus20110504" />

The first public indication that Yazoo was being revived was on 11 December 2007 when Erasure's website announced that an official Yazoo website and [[Myspace]] page were being set up.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Miller |title=Stripped: Depeche Mode |publisher=[[Music Sales Group|Omnibus Press]] |location=London, England |edition=3rd revised |year=2008 |isbn=978-1-84772-444-1}}</ref> On 13 December, the [[Planet Sound]] music magazine pages on the UK's [[Teletext]] service on [[Channel 4]] exclusively revealed that both Yazoo albums were to be reissued and that the duo were planning to reform and play a gig in support of the albums' release.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bernard|last=van Isacker|title=Yazoo reunion for reissue albums and first live gig in 25 years|publisher=Side-Line|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27901_0_2_0_C|date=18 December 2007|access-date=4 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906084012/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27901_0_2_0_C|archive-date=6 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Having re-established contact, Clarke and Moyet met on 8 April 2008 in a [[gentlemen's club|private members' club]] in London's [[Covent Garden]], with the occasion filmed by the press: it was the first time they had met since a mutual friend's wedding in the early 1990s.<ref name="Times20080418" /> The promotion for the tour received moderate television coverage, including a performance on the prime-time [[BBC]] chat show ''[[Friday Night with Jonathan Ross]]'', broadcast in the UK on 16 May 2008.<ref>{{cite web |title=Friday Night with Jonathan Ross – Series 14, Episode 17 |publisher=[[BBC]] |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bbwg4 |date=16 May 2008 |access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref> The tour was rapidly expanded to include concerts in Europe and in the US, as well as extra dates in the UK.

In an interview in May 2008 with the online magazine ''Side-Line'', Clarke said that there were plans to record the two London shows on the tour for a possible live album in the future.<ref>{{cite web|first=Bernard|last=van Isacker|title=Yazoo – It wasn't a well keened out marketing ploy!|publisher=Side-Line|url=http://www.side-line.com/interviews_comments.php?id=32146_0_16_0_C|date=30 May 2008|access-date=4 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907001705/http://www.side-line.com/interviews_comments.php?id=32146_0_16_0_C|archive-date=7 September 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> A double album titled ''[[Reconnected Live]]'', featuring tracks recorded on the "Reconnected" tour, was eventually released in September 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yazoo confirms 'Reconnected Live' formats and tracklisting|publisher=yazooinfo.com|url=http://www.yazooinfo.com/news_2010_06.html|date=28 June 2010|access-date=4 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211165805/http://www.yazooinfo.com/news_2010_06.html|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 14 May 2011, Moyet appeared as a guest on stage before Erasure's set on the second day of Mute Records' Short Circuit music festival at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] in London. She performed three Yazoo songs with Clarke, "Nobody's Diary", "Ode to Boy" and "Don't Go". In an interview prior to the concert, Moyet said she was "99.9% sure it's the last time" that she and Clarke would perform together as Yazoo, adding, "It was really good that Vince and I had come through the whole circle of being really angry with each other, forgetting what we'd been angry about, and forgetting that there was ever any displeasure."<ref name="Quietus20110504"/>
