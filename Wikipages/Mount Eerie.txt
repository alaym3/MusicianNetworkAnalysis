'''Mount Eerie''' is the musical project of American songwriter and producer [[Phil Elverum]]. Elverum (also of [[The Microphones]]) is the principal member of the band, but has collaborated with many other musicians on his records and in live performances. Most of Mount Eerie's releases have been issued on Elverum's label P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd., and feature highly detailed packaging with his own artwork.

==History==
===2003–2005: Career beginnings===
[[Image:elverum1.jpg|thumb|Elverum at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in May 2004 (shortly after switching from The Microphones to Mount Eerie)]]
Following the release of [[the Microphones]]' ''[[Mount Eerie (album)|Mount Eerie]]'' album, Elverum announced that he would no longer use the Microphones moniker, opting instead to record under the name Mount Eerie, after the area in [[Anacortes, Washington]] called [[Mount Erie (Washington)|Mount Erie]]. In an interview with [[CITR-FM]]'s ''Discorder'' in September 2003, Elverum gave his reasons for this change: "Mount Eerie is a new project. The Microphones was completed, or at least at a good stopping point. I did it because I am ready for new things. I am new."<ref>[http://discorder.ca/oldsite/features/03septmicrophones.html Discorder.ca – The Microphones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311063040/http://discorder.ca/oldsite/features/03septmicrophones.html |date=2007-03-11 }}</ref> Around this time, Elverum also changed the spelling of his own surname (previously, Elvrum).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6849-microphones/|title=Microphones - Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=15 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306110526/http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6849-microphones/|archive-date=6 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first Mount Eerie releases included a limited edition CD of new recordings (''[[Seven New Songs of "Mount Eerie"|Seven New Songs]]''), a 12" EP recorded live to acetate with local musicians during an Australian tour (''[[Mount Eerie Dances with Wolves]]''), and a live triple album released by [[Burnt Toast Vinyl]] in late 2004 (''Live in Copenhagen'').<ref name="exclaim">{{cite magazine|last=Gormley|first=Ian|date=November 5, 2018|title=Microphones, Mount Eerie and Melancholy: The Career of Phil Elverum|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/microphones_mount_eerie_and_melancholy_the_career_of_phil_elverum|archive-url=https://archive.today/20190608083338/http://exclaim.ca/music/article/microphones_mount_eerie_and_melancholy_the_career_of_phil_elverum|archive-date=June 8, 2019|access-date=June 8, 2019|magazine=[[Exclaim!]]|url-status=live}}</ref>

Elverum returned to his hometown of Anacortes after spending several years living in [[Olympia, Washington]] whilst recording for [[K Records]], and established his own label and imprint, P.W. Elverum & Sun, Ltd. The first official Mount Eerie studio album in Phil's eyes was ''[["No Flashlight": Songs of the Fulfilled Night|No Flashlight]]'', released in August 2005. The original pressing featured an extremely large fold-out sleeve with extensive footnotes and explanations. Following pressings of the album feature more simple packaging with the original liner notes and poster absent.

===2017–2020: ''A Crow Looked at Me'', ''Now Only'' and ''Lost Wisdom Pt. 2''===
In January 2017, the song "Real Death" was released from the forthcoming album ''[[A Crow Looked at Me]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18708-mount-eerie-real-death/|title="Real Death" by Mount Eerie Review {{!}} Pitchfork|website=Pitchfork.com|access-date=2017-01-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170219102108/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/tracks/18708-mount-eerie-real-death/|archive-date=2017-02-19|url-status=live}}</ref> A second single, "Ravens", was released on February 15.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gaca|first=Anna|url=http://www.spin.com/2017/02/mount-eerie-ravens-video/|title=New Music: Mount Eerie – "Ravens"|date=2017-02-15|access-date=2017-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170218032901/http://www.spin.com/2017/02/mount-eerie-ravens-video/|archive-date=2017-02-18|url-status=live}}</ref>
On March 24, ''[[A Crow Looked at Me]]'' was released to high critical praise. [[Exclaim!]]'s Alex Hudson scored the album a 9 out of 10, calling the record an "emotionally nuanced meditation on death that is both heartbreaking and hopeful."

January 2018, the album ''[[Now Only]]'' was announced along with the release of the album track "Distortion". A press release indicated that the album was written in 2017 shortly following the death of [[Geneviève Castrée]], Phil's wife. The album was officially released on March 16, 2018, to positive reviews, with [[The Atlantic]] describing the album as a progression from ''A Crow Looked at Me'': "not an experience of total sadness, featuring flashes of irony, hope, and love".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/mount-eerie-now-only-interview-phil-elverum/555485/|title=Phil Elverum Doesn't Want to Be the 'Saddest Musician on Earth'|last=Kornhaber|first=Spencer|date=2018-03-14|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=2019-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119214746/https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/03/mount-eerie-now-only-interview-phil-elverum/555485/|archive-date=2018-11-19|url-status=live}}</ref>

After touring North America in the summer of 2017, Elverum played songs from ''A Crow Looked at Me'' across Europe and Australasia.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/14/mount-eerie-review-phil-elverum|title=Mount Eerie review – truth defeats beauty on stark songs of death|last=Hann|first=Michael|date=2017-11-14|work=The Guardian|access-date=2019-01-13|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190503073455/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/14/mount-eerie-review-phil-elverum|archive-date=2019-05-03|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thespinoff.co.nz/music/15-01-2018/how-to-listen-to-mount-eerie-the-saddest-musician-in-the-world/|title=How to listen to Mount Eerie, the saddest musician in the world|last=Stephens|first=Murdoch|date=2018-01-15|website=The Spinoff|access-date=2019-01-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502215710/https://thespinoff.co.nz/music/15-01-2018/how-to-listen-to-mount-eerie-the-saddest-musician-in-the-world/|archive-date=2019-05-02|url-status=live}}</ref> The second of these shows became ''[[(after)]]'', a live recording eventually released in September 2018 and was well received by Pitchfork who noted "the most striking thing about ''(after)'' is that, even after so many performances, these songs sound as raw as they did when Elverum first committed them to paper and tape".<ref name="Pitchfork (after) review">{{cite web |last1=Reese |first1=Nathan |title=Mount Eerie(after) |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mount-eerie-after/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=October 25, 2019 |date=October 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200425191258/https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/mount-eerie-after/ |archive-date=April 25, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== Artistry ==
Elverum's music under the Mount Eerie moniker expresses a close relationship to nature and the Pacific Northwest, in particular the minute details.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Litowitz|first=Drew|date=2012-05-23|title=Album Review: Mount Eerie - Clear Moon|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2012/05/album-review-mount-eerie-clear-moon/|access-date=2020-07-09|website=[[Consequence of Sound]]|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name="Eric Hill" /> Early Mount Eerie albums often discussed how "the distinction between wild and not wild is an illusion".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gotrich|first=Lars|date=August 6, 2020|title=Phil Elverum Returns To A Refuge As The Microphones|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/08/06/899325158/the-microphones-2020-phil-elverum-interview|access-date=2020-12-27|website=[[NPR]]|language=en}}</ref> In a 2014 interview, Elverum discussed how his choice for moniker coming from a mountain in Anacortes was a way of infusing a sense of regional connection between the music and the place.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|last1=Porter|first1=Christa|last2=Porter|first2=Richard|date=March 19, 2018|title=An Interview With Phil Elverum of Mount Eerie|url=https://www.liveineverett.com/blog//an-interview-with-phil-elverum-of-mount-eeriethe-microphones|access-date=2020-08-10|website=Live in Everett|language=en-US}}</ref>

His lyrical matter has been seen by some to be more introspective than his work before the name change.<ref name=":6"/> Brady Baker of ''Spectrum Culture'' called Mount Eerie "a solid foundation for an ever-expanding lyrical labyrinth that centers on his introspective philosophy."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Baker|first=Brady|date=2009-09-13|title=Interview: Phil Elverum|url=https://spectrumculture.com/2009/09/13/interview-phil-elverum/|access-date=2020-09-13|website=Spectrum Culture|language=en-US}}</ref> Eric Hill of ''[[Exclaim!]]'' believed the opposite, writing that Elverum's work under the Mount Eerie title is more "universal and, at times, hermetic."<ref name="Eric Hill">{{cite web|last=Hill|first=Eric|date=March 27, 2017|title=An Essential Guide to Mount Eerie, the Microphones and the World of Phil Elverum|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/an_essential_guide_to_mount_eerie_the_microphones_and_the_world_of_phil_elverum|access-date=January 30, 2020|website=[[Exclaim]]}}</ref>

Elverum also believed that the songs under Mount Eerie were more universal describing them as "this one long chain, about the idea of singing from the point of view of this dark looming mountain shape, while Microphones songs, historically, have been more personally narrative, maybe more human."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Howe|first=Brian|date=May 13, 2008|title=Microphones|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/6849-microphones/|access-date=2020-08-11|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en}}</ref> After the death of Elverum's wife, [[Geneviève Castrée]], in 2016 his lyrics became more direct and plainspoken.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Moreland|first=Quinn|date=August 7, 2020|title=The Microphones: Microphones in 2020|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/the-microphones-microphones-in-2020/|access-date=2020-12-27|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en}}</ref>
