'''Amorphis''' is a Finnish [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band founded by Jan Rechberger, [[Tomi Koivusaari]], and [[Esa Holopainen]] in 1990. Initially, the band was a [[death metal]] act, but on later albums they evolved into playing other genres, including [[progressive metal]], and [[folk metal]]. They frequently use the ''[[Kalevala]]'', the epic poem of Finland, as a source for their lyrics.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2017/03/07/heavy-metal-rockers-draw-inspiration-finnish-epics/98491664/|title=Heavy metal rockers draw inspiration from Finnish epics|last=Aberback|first=Brian|date=7 March 2017|website=[[North Jersey Media Group]]|access-date=3 February 2019}}</ref>

==History==

===''Disment of Soul'' and ''The Karelian Isthmus''===
Jan Rechberger played in a [[thrash metal]] band called Violent Solution, which [[Tomi Koivusaari]] had left in 1990 to form the [[death metal]] band [[Abhorrence]], with Koivusaari being replaced by [[Esa Holopainen]]. Violent Solution slowly dissolved with Jan Rechberger and Esa Holopainen deciding to continue working with each other to form their own death metal band, Amorphis.{{Clarify|date=August 2009}} With Rechberger having ties with Koivusaari, in early 1990, Koivusaari became the vocalist and the band also got [[Olli-Pekka Laine|Oppu Laine]] to become their bassist. During that time, Koivusaari also performed rhythm guitar, leading to the band dumping all original compositions and starting over again.{{Why|date=August 2009}} Koivusaari's other band, Abhorrence, split up and he found himself with more time to put into Amorphis.

A demo tape, ''Disment of Soul'', was recorded in 1991 by [[Timo Tolkki]] at TTT studios. It was meant to be ''Dismemberment of soul'' but they forgot the word "member" and so it was Disment.

[[Image:Amorphis1992.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Amorphis in 1992 with Jukka Kolehmainen of Abhorrence]]
After the band recorded their first studio demo tape, [[Relapse Records]] offered Abhorrence a recording contract. Since Abhorrence was no longer active, they sent their own demo in the return mail and were signed to a worldwide recording deal. Soon after getting signed, they released their death metal debut, ''[[The Karelian Isthmus]]'', under the new name Amorphis and later released the ''[[Privilege of Evil]]'' EP.<ref name="LarkinHR">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Heavy Rock]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1999|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0257-7|pages=26/7}}</ref> The EP featured Abhorrence's original vocalist, Jukka Kolehmainen, on vocals on the Abhorrence cover song, "Vulgar Necrolatry".

===''Tales from the Thousand Lakes''===
In 1994, Amorphis released their second studio album, ''[[Tales from the Thousand Lakes]]'', a concept album based on the Finnish national epic, the ''Kalevala''.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> This 1994 release, while still rooted in death metal, was their first step toward a new direction as melodic [[clean vocals]] were added, provided by Ville Tuomi. ''Tales from the Thousand Lakes'' won the band a fan base thanks to its innovative sound and fusion of death metal with traditional folk, psychedelia, and progressive elements. This album went on to influence the signature Amorphis sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shop.relapse.com/info/about.aspx|title=Relapse Records|publisher=Shop.relapse.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110729190414/https://shop.relapse.com/info/about.aspx|archive-date=29 July 2011|access-date=24 July 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===''Elegy''===
During the subsequent tours, Martenson (keyboards) left the band, to be replaced by Kim Rantala. Rechberger was replaced by Pekka Kasari (ex-[[Stone (band)|Stone]]), and a sixth member was recruited, singer [[Pasi Koskinen]].<ref name="LarkinHR"/> The third album, ''[[Elegy (Amorphis album)|Elegy]]'', was released in 1996.<ref name="LarkinHR"/> Lyrics were again adapted from Finnish mythology, in this case, the ''Kanteletar'', a collection of ancient folk poetry. Pasi and Tomi shared the vocals on an equal basis, with Pasi providing only clean parts. After a year and a half of touring following the release of ''Elegy'', the band members took a hiatus.

===''Tuonela'' and ''Story: 10th Anniversary''===
Their next offering, 1999's ''[[Tuonela (album)|Tuonela]]'', was a mellow guitar album, although toward the end of the studio sessions, Santeri Kallio of Kyyria was brought in to add some keyboard tracks to the songs. New instruments were introduced (Tomi playing sitar in the song "Greed", Sakari Kukko on saxophone and flute providing a foreign accent) and the death growls were reduced, as all vocals were performed by Pasi.<ref name="amorphis">{{cite web|url=http://www.amorphis.net/?page_id=2|title=Band|publisher=Amorphis|access-date=6 November 2011}}</ref>

The band experienced another line-up change. Following the breakup of Kyyria, Santeri joined Amorphis as a full-time member. Bassist Oppu was replaced by another ex-Kyyria member, Niclas Etelävuori, to tour with Amorphis on their third United States tour.<ref name="amorphis"/>

The tenth-anniversary compilation ''[[Story (Amorphis album)|Story]]'' was released.

===''Am Universum''===
''[[Am Universum]]'' was released in 2001, and included more emphasis on keyboards and saxophone work, the latter contributed by [[Sakari Kukko]]. It was an experimental album and Amorphis' most psychedelic to date.<ref name="amorphis"/>

===''Far from the Sun'' and ''Chapters''===
In 2002, the band contributed to the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Menolippu Mombasaan]]''. The commissioned piece was a cover version of a 1976 Finnish pop hit "Kuusamo", and is currently the band's only song in their native language.<ref name="amorphis"/> The same year they started to record the band's last album with Relapse Records, ''Far from the Sun''. In 2003, Relapse released the retrospective ''[[Chapters (Amorphis album)|Chapters]]'', which included a DVD featuring the band's videos from "Black Winter Day" to "Alone". ''[[Far from the Sun]]'' was produced by the band itself, which had been rejoined by original drummer Jan Rechberger after Pekka Kasari had quit to concentrate on family duties. Pasi left the band in 2004 after nine years.<ref name="amorphis"/>

===''Eclipse''===
While searching for a new vocalist Amorphis received over a hundred demo tapes from prospective vocalists but none of them became the new frontman of the band. Eventually [[Tomi Joutsen]] got an audition through word of mouth and he became their next singer in 2005.<ref name="amorphis"/> Joutsen, best known for his work with metal band Sinisthra,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sinisthra.com/|title=Biography|publisher=Sinisthra|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105203228/https://www.sinisthra.com/|archive-date=5 January 2014|access-date=24 July 2019}}</ref> urged Amorphis to return to the use of contrasting vocal styles for their next album.<ref name="amorphis"/> His first album with the band, ''[[Eclipse (Amorphis album)|Eclipse]]'', was released in 2006.

===''Silent Waters''===
Amorphis followed ''Eclipse'' with gigs and festival appearances throughout Europe, all the while writing new material for the follow-up.<ref name="amorphis"/> They released their next album, ''[[Silent Waters (Amorphis album)|Silent Waters]]'', on 3 September 2007, achieving gold certification in Finland for the second time.<ref name="blabbermouth"/> The album marked the first time in the history of the band that an album was recorded with the same personnel as the previous one.<ref name="amorphis"/> In support of ''Silent Waters'', Amorphis launched their third headlining tour in North America alongside supporting acts [[Samael (band)|Samael]] and [[Virgin Black]].<ref name="blabbermouth"/>

''[[Circle (Amorphis album)|Circle]]'' was released on 19 April in Europe and 30 April in North America. [[Tomi Joutsen]] said about the new album, "Circle represents integrity.

But in this story, the protagonist was invited among the wise men's circle."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/amorphis/amorphis-new-album-details-revealed/10151428886266125|title=AMORPHIS - New Album Details Revealed!|website=[[Facebook]]|access-date=19 March 2015}}</ref>

On 16 September 2013, ''Circle'' won [[Metal Hammer]]'s "Album of the Year" award. Esa Holopainen said about the award, "For us, Album of the Year award is a great recognition for the work done so far. Especially when we got it from our 11th studio album."<ref name="amorphis.net"/>

On 4 August 2014, Amorphis announced on their website and through social media that they would be playing a number of special ''Tales from the Thousand Lakes'' 20th anniversary shows where their 1994 album would be performed in its entirety.

===''Under the Red Cloud''===
The band began demoing new songs at the start of 2015, and on 4 March, it was announced that Amorphis would begin to record a new album in April, at Fascination Street Studio, [[Örebro]], [[Sweden]] with [[Jens Bogren]], and with an album release date sometime in September 2015.

The lyrics would be written once again by Pekka Kainulainen, who says, "Like 'Kalevala', they are descriptions of natural phenomena, seasons and the human mind. Reoccurring situations where hope and uncertainty alternate. Attempting to gain advice from higher powers. The poems do not form a complete story per se, but they are drawn together by a certain theme. We live under a red cloud and once again, time weighs us."{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The release of the new album was to be followed by a world tour, starting with shows in the band's home country of Finland, then other parts of Europe with [[Nightwish]] and [[Arch Enemy]] in November 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/amorphis-to-begin-recording-new-album-in-april/|title=Amorphis To Begin Recording New Album In April|date=4 March 2015|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=19 March 2015}}</ref>
