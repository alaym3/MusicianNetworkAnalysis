A '''dystopia''' (from [[Ancient Greek]] δυσ- "bad, hard" and τόπος "place"; alternatively '''cacotopia'''<ref name="Bentham">Cacotopia (from κακός ''kakos'' "bad") was the term used by [[Jeremy Bentham]] in his 1818 Plan of Parliamentary Reform ({{cite web|url=http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|title=Dystopia |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326062103/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/col-dystopia.htm|archive-date=26 March 2006|url-status=dead|access-date=19 March 2006}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ye0vWc85eYC&pg=PA230])</ref> or simply '''anti-utopia''') is a speculated community or society that is undesirable or frightening.<ref name=Merriam/><ref name=Oxford/> It is often treated as an [[Opposite (semantics)|antonym]] of ''[[utopia]]'', a term that was coined by [[Thomas More|Sir Thomas More]] and figures as the title of [[Utopia (book)|his best known work]], published in 1516, which created a blueprint for an ideal society with [[Minimal criminal|minimal crime]], violence and poverty. The relationship between utopia and dystopia is in actuality not one simple opposition, as many [[utopia]]n elements and components are found in dystopias as well, and ''[[vice versa]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-07-06|title=Dystopia - Examples and Definition of Dystopia as a Literary Device|url=https://literarydevices.net/dystopia/|access-date=2021-10-01|website=Literary Devices|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title=Utopia vs. Dystopia|work=Okanogan School District|url=https://www.oksd.wednet.edu/cms/lib/WA01001356/Centricity/Domain/120/Utopia%20vs.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=The Fine Line between Utopia and Dystopia {{!}} The Prolongation of Work|url=https://sites.williams.edu/engl117s16/uncategorized/the-fine-line-between-utopia-and-dystopia/|access-date=2021-10-01|website=sites.williams.edu}}</ref>

Dystopias are often characterized by rampant fear or distress,<ref name=Merriam>{{cite web|work=Merriam-Webster|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/dystopia}}</ref> [[tyrant|tyrannical]] governments, [[environmental disaster]],<ref name=Oxford>{{cite web|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|title=Definition of "dystopia"|year=2012|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/dystopia?q=dystopia}}</ref> or other characteristics associated with a cataclysmic decline in society. Despite certain overlaps, dystopian fiction is distinct from post-apocalyptic fiction, and an undesirable society is not necessarily dystopian. Dystopian societies appear in many [[utopian and dystopian fiction|fictional works]] and artistic representations, particularly in stories set in the future. The best known by far is [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1948). Other famous examples are [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932), and [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953). Dystopian societies appear in many sub-genres of fiction and are often used to draw attention to society, [[Environmental issues|environment]], politics, economics, religion, psychology, ethics, science, or technology. Some authors use the term to refer to existing societies, many of which are, or have been, [[totalitarian]] states or societies in an advanced state of collapse. Dystopias, through an exaggerated worst-case scenario, often make a criticism about a current trend, societal norm, or political system.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Read Write Think|date=2006|title=Dystopias: Definition and Characteristics|url=http://www.readwritethink.org/files/resources/lesson_images/lesson926/DefinitionCharacteristics.pdf|url-status=live|website=Read Write Think}}</ref> 

The entire substantial [[sub-genre]] of [[alternative history]] works depicting a world in which [[Hypothetical Axis victory in World War II|Nazi Germany won the Second World War]] can be considered as dystopias. So can other works of Alternative History, in which a historical turning point led to a manifestly repressive world. For example, the 2004 [[mockumentary]] ''[[C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America]],''and [[Ben H. Winters|Ben Winters]]' ''[[Underground Airlines]]'', in which [[slavery in the United States]] continues to the present, with "electronic slave auctions" carried out via the Internet and slaves controlled by electronic devices implanted in their spines, or [[Keith Roberts]] ''[[Pavane (novel)|Pavane]]'' in which 20th Century Britain is ruled by a Catholic theocracy and the [[Inquisition]] is actively torturing and burning "heretics".{{fact|date=July 2021}}

Some scholars, such as [[Gregory Claeys]] and [[Lyman Tower Sargent]], make certain distinctions between typical synonyms of dystopias. For example, Claeys and Sargent define ''literary dystopias'' as societies imagined as substantially worse than the society in which the author writes. Some of these are '''anti-utopias''', which criticise attempts to implement various concepts of utopia.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=24EUCgAAQBAJ|title=The Utopia Reader|isbn=9780814715710|last1=Claeys|first1=Gregory|last2=Sargent|first2=Lyman Tower|date=1999}}</ref> In the most comprehensive treatment of the literary and real expressions of the concept, ''Dystopia: A Natural History'', Claeys offers a historical approach to these definitions.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2wKTDQAAQBAJ&q=Dystopia%3A+A+Natural+History.+Oxford+University+Press%2C+2016.|title=Dystopia: A Natural History|isbn=9780191088612|last=Claeys|first=Gregory|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2016}}</ref> Here the tradition is traced from early reactions to the [[French Revolution]]. Its commonly [[Collectivism|anti-collectivist]] character is stressed, and the addition of other themes—the dangers of science and technology, of social inequality, of corporate dictatorship, of nuclear war—are also traced. A psychological approach is also favored here, with the principle of fear being identified with despotic forms of rule, carried forward from the history of political thought, and group psychology introduced as a means of understanding the relationship between utopia and dystopia. Andrew Norton-Schwartzbard noted that "written many centuries before the concept "dystopia" existed, [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' in fact includes most of the typical characteristics associated with this genre – even if placed in a religious framework rather than in the future of the mundane world, as modern dystopias tend to be".<ref>Dr. Andrew C. Norton-Schwartzbard, "Foretastes of Modernity in Renaissance Literature and Art" in Catherine Summers (ed.) "Papers Presented to The Fourth Inter-University Symposium on Late Medieval Culture", p.59, p.71 (note).</ref>

==Etymology==
Though several earlier usages are known, ''dystopia'' was used as an antonym for ''[[utopia]]'' by [[John Stuart Mill]] in one of his 1868 Parliamentary Speeches (''[[Hansard]] Commons'') by adding the prefix "dys" ({{lang-grc|δυσ-}} "bad") to "topia", reinterpreting the initial "u" as the prefix "eu" ({{lang-grc|ευ-}} "good") instead of "ou" ({{lang-grc|οὐ}} "not").<ref>{{cite news |last=Tisdall |first=Nigel |url=https://www.ft.com/content/2f94aa6a-a0f8-11e6-891e-abe238dee8e2 |title=Postcard from Belgium: the birthplace of utopia |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=4 November 2016 |access-date=28 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mill |first=John Stuart |date=1988 |title=Public and parliamentary speeches – Part I – November 1850 – November 1868 |url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/262 |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |isbn=0-415-03791-3 |access-date=16 February 2015 }}</ref> It was used to denounce the government's Irish land policy: "It is, perhaps, too complimentary to call them Utopians, they ought rather to be called dys-topians, or caco-topians. What is commonly called Utopian is something too good to be practicable; but what they appear to favour is too bad to be practicable".<ref name="Hermansson">Cf. [http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm "Dystopia Timeline"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060503015002/http://hem.passagen.se/replikant/dystopia_timeline.htm|date=3 May 2006}}, in ''Exploring Dystopia'', "edited and designed by Niclas Hermansson; Contributors: Acolyte of Death ('Gattaca'), John Steinbach ('Nuclear Nightmare'), [and] David Clements ('From Dystopia to Myopia')" (''hem.passagen.se''), Niclas Hermansson, n.d., [[World Wide Web|Web]], 22 May 2009.<!--This site appears to be a self-published website and its reliability may be dubious.

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', a "dystopia" is:

<blockquote>"An imaginary place or condition in which everything is as bad as possible; opp. UTOPIA (cf. CACOTOPIA). So dystopian n., one who advocates or describes a dystopia; dystopian a., of or pertaining to a dystopia; dystopianism, dystopian quality or characteristics."</blockquote>

The example of first usage given in the ''OED'' (1989 ed.) refers to the 1868 speech by John Stuart Mill quoted above. Other examples given in the ''OED'' include:

Decades before the first documented use of the word "dystopia" was "cacotopia"/"kakotopia" (using {{lang-grc|κακόs}}, "bad, wicked") originally proposed in 1818 by [[Jeremy Bentham]], "As a match for utopia (or the imagined seat of the best government) suppose a cacotopia (or the imagined seat of the worst government) discovered and described".<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dkako%2Fs κακόs], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus</ref><ref name="bentham">Bentham, Jeremy.

==Common themes==
===Politics===
In ''[[When the Sleeper Wakes]]'', [[H.&nbsp;G.&nbsp;Wells]] depicted the governing class as [[hedonistic]] and shallow.<ref name=Steinhoff153>William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 153, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.</ref> [[George Orwell]] contrasted Wells's world to that depicted in Jack London's ''[[The Iron Heel]]'', where the dystopian rulers are brutal and dedicated to the point of fanaticism, which Orwell considered more plausible.<ref name=Steinhoff147>William Steinhoff, "Utopia Reconsidered: Comments on ''1984''" 147, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.</ref>

The political principles at the root of fictional utopias (or "perfect worlds") are [[idealism|idealistic]] in principle and result in positive consequences for the inhabitants; the political principles on which fictional dystopias are based, while often based on utopian ideals, result in negative consequences for inhabitants because of at least one [[fatal flaw]].<ref name="Utopia">[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Utopia "Utopia"], ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', 4th ed., 2004, ''[[Dictionary.com]]'', [[World Wide Web|Web]], 11 February 2007.</ref><ref name=Snodgrass>[[Mary Ellen Snodgrass]], ''Encyclopedia of Utopian Literature'', ABC-Clio Literary Companion Ser. (Santa Barbara: ABC-Clio Inc., 1995) xii.  {{ISBN|0874367573|978-0874367577}}<!--not verified.--></ref>

Dystopias are often filled with [[pessimism|pessimistic]] views of the ruling class or a government that is brutal or uncaring, ruling with an "iron fist".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} Dystopian governments are sometimes ruled by a [[Totalitarianism|fascist or communist]] regime or dictator. These dystopian government establishments often have protagonists or groups that lead a "[[Resistance movement|resistance]]" to enact change within their society, as is seen in [[Alan Moore]]'s ''[[V for Vendetta]]''.<ref name=Donawerth>Jane Donawerth, "Genre Blending and the Critical Dystopia", in ''Dark Horizons: Science Fiction and the Dystopian Imagination'', ed. Raffaella Baccolini and Tom Moylan (New York: Routledge, 2003).</ref>

Dystopian political situations are depicted in novels such as ''[[We (novel)|We]]'', ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'', ''[[Darkness at Noon]]'', ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[The Handmaid's Tale]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (book)|Divergent]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' and such films as ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'', ''[[Brazil (1985 film)|Brazil]]'' (1985), ''[[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions]]'', ''[[Soylent Green]]'', ''[[Logan's Run]]'', and ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'' (1987).{{fact|date=July 2021}}

===Economics===
The economic structures of dystopian societies in literature and other media have many variations, as the economy often relates directly to the elements that the writer is depicting as the source of the oppression. There are several [[archetypes]] that such societies tend to follow. A theme is the dichotomy of [[Planned economy|planned economies]] versus [[free market]] economies, a conflict which is found in such works as [[Ayn Rand]]'s ''[[Anthem]]'' and [[Henry Kuttner]]'s short story "The Iron Standard". Another example of this is reflected in [[Norman Jewison]]'s 1975 film ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]'' (1975).{{fact|date=July 2021}}

Some dystopias, such as that of ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'', feature [[black market]]s with goods that are dangerous and difficult to obtain or the characters may be at the mercy of the state-controlled economy. [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Player Piano (novel)|Player Piano]]'' depicts a dystopia in which the centrally controlled economic system has indeed made material abundance plentiful but deprived the mass of humanity of meaningful labor; virtually all work is menial, unsatisfying and only a small number of the small group that achieves education is admitted to the elite and its work.<ref>Howard P. Segal, "Vonnegut's ''Player Piano'': An Ambiguous Technological Dystopia," 163 in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.</ref> In [[Tanith Lee]]'s ''[[Don't Bite the Sun]]'', there is no want of any kind – only unabashed consumption and hedonism, leading the protagonist to begin looking for a deeper meaning to existence.<ref>Lee, Tanith. ''Don't Bite the Sun''. Bantam Books:1999.</ref> Even in dystopias where the economic system is not the source of the society's flaws, as in ''Brave New World'', the state often controls the economy; a character, reacting with horror to the suggestion of not being part of the social body, cites as a reason that everyone works for everyone else.<ref>William Matter, "On Brave New World" 98, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''.  {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.</ref>

Other works feature extensive [[privatization]] and [[corporatism]]; both consequences of [[capitalism]], where privately owned and unaccountable large corporations have replaced the government in setting policy and making decisions. They manipulate, infiltrate, control, bribe, are contracted by and [[corporate republic|function as government]]. This is seen in the novels ''[[Jennifer Government]]'' and ''[[Oryx and Crake]]'' and the movies ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[Visioneers]]'', ''[[Idiocracy]]'', ''Soylent Green'', ''[[THX 1138]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'' and ''[[Rollerball (1975 film)|Rollerball]]''. Corporate republics are common in the [[cyberpunk]] genre, as in [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[Snow Crash]]'' and [[Philip K. Dick]]'s ''[[Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?]]'' (as well as the film ''[[Blade Runner]]'', influenced by and based upon Dick's novel).{{fact|date=July 2021}}

====Class====
Dystopian fiction frequently draws stark contrasts between the privileges of the ruling class and the dreary existence of the working class.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} In the 1931 novel ''Brave New World'' by [[Aldous Huxley]], a class system is prenatally determined with Alphas, Betas, Gammas, Deltas and Epsilons, with the lower classes having reduced brain-function and special conditioning to make them satisfied with their position in life.<ref>William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 95, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.</ref> Outside of this society there also exist several human settlements that exist in the ''conventional'' way but which the class system describe as "savages".{{fact|date=July 2021}}

In ''Ypsilon Minus'' by [[Herbert W. Franke]], people are divided into numerous alphabetically ranked groups.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

In the film [[Elysium (film)|''Elysium'']], the majority of Earth's population on the surface lives in poverty with little access to health care and are subject to worker exploitation and police brutality, while the wealthy live above the Earth in luxury with access to technologies that cure all diseases, reverse aging, and regenerate body parts.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

Written a century earlier, the future society depicted in [[H.G. Wells]]' ''[[The Time Machine]]'' had started in a similar way to ''Elysium'' – the workers consigned to living and working in underground tunnels while the wealthy live on a surface made into an enormous beautiful garden. But over a long time period the roles were eventually reversed – the rich degenerated and became a decadent "livestock" regularly caught and eaten by the underground cannibal Morlocks.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

===Family===
Some fictional dystopias, such as ''[[Brave New World]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'', have eradicated the family and keep it from re-establishing itself as a social institution. In ''Brave New World'', where children are reproduced artificially, the concepts of "mother" and "father" are considered [[obscene]].  In some novels, such as [[We (novel)|''We'']], the state is hostile to motherhood, as a pregnant woman from One State is in revolt.<ref name=Beauchamp>Gorman Beauchamp, "Zamiatin's ''We''" 70, in Eric S. Rabkin, Martin H. Greenberg, and Joseph D. Olander, eds., ''No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction''. {{ISBN|0-8093-1113-5}}.</ref>

===Religion===
Religious groups play the role of the oppressed and oppressors. In ''Brave New World'' the establishment of the state included lopping off the tops of all crosses (as symbols of Christianity) to make them "T"s, (as symbols of [[Ford Model T|Henry Ford's Model T]]).<ref>William Matter, "On ''Brave New World''" 94, in Eric S.

===Identity===
In the Russian novel ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' by [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]], first published in 1921, people are permitted to live out of public view twice a week for one hour and are only referred to by numbers instead of names. The latter feature also appears in the later, unrelated film ''[[THX 1138]]''. In some dystopian works, such as [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s ''[[Harrison Bergeron]]'', society forces individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to radical [[egalitarian]] social norms that discourage or suppress accomplishment or even competence as forms of inequality.{{fact|date=July 2021}}

===Violence===
Violence is prevalent in many dystopias, often in the form of war, but also in urban crimes led by (predominately teenage) [[gang]]s (e.g. ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]''), or rampant crime met by [[blood sport]]s (e.g. ''[[Battle Royale (novel)|Battle Royale]]'', ''[[The Running Man (1987 film)|The Running Man]]'', ''[[The Hunger Games]]'', ''[[Divergent (novel)|Divergent]]'', and ''[[The Purge]]''). It is also explained in [[Suzanne Berne]]'s essay "Ground Zero", where she explains her experience of the aftermath of 11 September 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Berne|first=Suzanne|journal=Patterns for College Writing|title=Ground Zero|page=182}}</ref>

===Nature===
Fictional dystopias are commonly urban and frequently isolate their characters from all contact with the natural world.<ref>{{cite book|chapter=Avatism and Utopia 4|editor1=Eric S. Rabkin|editor2=Martin H. Greenberg|editor3=Joseph D. Olander|title=No Place Else: Explorations in Utopian and Dystopian Fiction|year=1983|isbn=0-8093-1113-5}}</ref> Sometimes they require their characters to avoid nature, as when [[Walking#Leisure activity|walks]] are regarded as dangerously [[Anti-social behaviour|anti-social]] in Ray Bradbury's ''Fahrenheit 451'', as well as within Bradbury's short story "[[The Pedestrian]]".{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}  In [[C. S. Lewis]]'s ''[[That Hideous Strength]]'', science coordinated by government is directed toward the control of nature and the elimination of natural human instincts.  In ''Brave New World'', the lower class is conditioned to be afraid of nature but also to visit the countryside and consume transport and games to promote economic activity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Huxley|first1=Aldous|title=Brave New World|url=https://archive.org/details/BraveNewWorld-and-BraveNewWorldRevisited}}</ref> Lois Lowry's "[[The Giver]]" shows a society where technology and the desire to create a utopia has led humanity to enforce climate control on the environment, as well as to eliminate many undomesticated species and to provide psychological and pharmaceutical repellent against human instincts. [[E. M. Forster]]'s "[[The Machine Stops]]" depicts a highly changed global environment which forces people to live underground due to an atmospheric contamination.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Galdon Rodriguez|first=Angel|date=2014|title=Urban and Natural Spaces in Dystopian Literature Depicted as Opposed Scenarios|url=http://pendientedemigracion.ucm.es/info/angulo/volumen/Volumen06-2/articulos05.htm|journal=Ángulo Recto.

Excessive pollution that destroys nature is common in many dystopian films, such as ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[RoboCop]]'', ''[[WALL-E]]'', ''[[April and the Extraordinary World]]'' and ''[[Soylent Green]]''.  A few "green" fictional dystopias do exist, such as in [[Michael Carson (author)|Michael Carson]]'s short story "[[The Punishment of Luxury]]", and [[Russell Hoban]]'s ''[[Riddley Walker]]''. The latter is set in the aftermath of nuclear war, "a [[Nuclear holocaust|post-nuclear holocaust]] Kent, where technology has reduced to the level of the [[Iron Age]]".<ref>{{cite book|contributor-last=Self|contributor-first=W.|year=2002|page=v|contribution=Introduction|last=Hoban|first=Russell|author-link=Russell Hoban|orig-year=1980|title=[[Riddley Walker]]|publisher=Bloomsbury|location=London}}</ref>{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Science and technology===
Contrary to the [[Technological utopianism|technologically utopian]] claims, which view technology as a beneficial addition to all aspects of humanity, technological dystopia concerns itself with and focuses largely (but not always) on the negative effects caused by new technology.<ref name="auto2">Rushkoff, D. (2002). "Renaissance Now! Media Ecology and the New Global Narrative." ''Explorations in Media Ecology'', 1(1), 21–32.</ref>

====Typical dystopian claims====
1. ''Technologies reflect and encourage the worst aspects of human nature.<ref name="auto2"/>''
[[Jaron Lanier]], a digital pioneer, has become a technological dystopian: "I think it’s a way of interpreting technology in which people forgot taking responsibility."{{fact|date=July 2021}}

“'Oh, it’s the computer that did it, not me.' 'There’s no more middle class? Oh, it’s not me. The computer did it'" (Lanier). This quote explains that people begin to not only blame the technology for the changes in lifestyle but also believe that technology is an omnipotence. It also points to a technological determinist perspective in terms of reification.<ref>Chandler, D. (3 July 2013). Technological or Media Determinism. Retrieved 2 March 2015, from http://visual-memory.co.uk/daniel/Documents/tecdet/tdet05.html</ref>

2. ''Technologies harm our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities.<ref name="auto1">Rosenbaum, R. (1 January 2013). What Turned Jaron Lanier Against the Web? Retrieved 2 March 2015, from http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/what-turned-jaron-lanier-against-the-web-165260940/?all&no-ist</ref>''
* decrease in communication within family members and friend groups due to increased time in technology use
* virtual space misleadingly heightens the impact of real presence; people resort to technological medium for communication nowadays

3. ''Technologies reinforce hierarchies – concentrate knowledge and skills; increase surveillance and erode privacy; widen inequalities of power and wealth; giving up control to machines). ''
[[Douglas Rushkoff]], a technological utopian, states in his article that the professional designers "re-mystified" the computer so it wasn't so readable anymore; users had to depend on the special programs built into the software that was incomprehensible for normal users.<ref name="auto2"/>

4. ''New technologies are sometimes regressive (worse than previous technologies).<ref name="auto2"/>''

5. ''The unforeseen impacts of technology are negative.<ref name="auto2"/>''
“ 'The most common way is that there’s some magic artificial intelligence in the sky or in the cloud or something that knows how to translate, and what a wonderful thing that this is available for free. But there’s another way to look at it, which is the technically true way: You gather a ton of information from real live translators who have translated phrases… It’s huge but very much like Facebook, it’s selling people back to themselves… [With translation] you’re producing this result that looks magical but in the meantime, the original translators aren’t paid for their work… You’re actually shrinking the economy.'"<ref name="auto1"/>

6. ''More efficiency and choices can harm our quality of life (by causing stress, destroying jobs, making us more materialistic).<ref name="auto3">Heitman, B. (13 April 2011). "The Information: A History, A Theory, A Flood". (Books) (Book review). ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 146–150.</ref>''
In his article "Prest-o! Change-o!,” technological dystopian [[James Gleick]] mentions the remote control being the classic example of technology that does not solve the problem "it is meant to solve". Gleick quotes Edward Tenner, a historian of technology, that the ability and ease of switching channels by the remote control serves to increase distraction for the viewer. Then it is only expected that people will become more dissatisfied with the channel they are watching.<ref name="auto3"/>

7. ''New technologies can solve problems of old technologies or just create new problems.<ref name="auto2"/>''
The remote control example explains this claim as well, for the increase in laziness and dissatisfaction levels was clearly not a problem in times without the remote control. He also takes social psychologist Robert Levine's example of Indonesians "'whose main entertainment consists of watching the same few plays and dances, month after month, year after year,’ and with Nepalese Sherpas who eat the same meals of potatoes and tea through their entire lives. The Indonesians and Sherpas are perfectly satisfied". Because of the invention of the remote control, it merely created more problems.<ref name="auto3"/>

8. ''Technologies destroy nature (harming human health and the environment). ''
The need for business replaced community and the "story online" replaced people as the "soul of the Net". Because information was now able to be bought and sold, there was not as much communication taking place.<ref name="auto2"/>...
