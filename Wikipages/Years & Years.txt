To celebrate the launch of the album, a world first interactive ad-break takeover happened on Channel 4, on the evening the album was released. Three exclusive music videos for the band's next single, "[[Shine (Years & Years song)|Shine]]", were filmed especially for the initiative, and fans were encouraged to 'take control' of the ad break by tweeting the hashtag for the video they most wanted to see; #ChooseLight, #ChooseShadow or #ChooseDark. The initiative garnered 1.55 million viewers and resulted in the most interacted-with ad in Channel 4 history. "[[Shine (Years & Years song)|Shine]]" was released as the band's seventh single, serving as a follow-up to their sixth single, "King". It was released on 5 July 2015, peaking at number 2 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. "[[Eyes Shut]]" was released as their eighth single that was to be taken from ''Communion''.

The music video was released on the next day, accompanied by an open letter from frontman [[Olly Alexander]] on the band's Facebook page.
