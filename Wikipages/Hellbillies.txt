'''Hellbillies''' is a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[rock music|rock]] band.<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://snl.no/Hellbillies |title=Hellbillies Biography |language=Norwegian |first=Jon Vidar |last=Bergan |encyclopedia=[[Store Norske Leksikon]] |publisher=[[Kunnskapsforlaget]] |date=2013-02-19 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

==Biography==
As of 2012, they have released thirteen albums—including a compilation and two live albums—as well as two live concert DVDs. They are among Norway's most popular recording artists.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2012/11/25/kultur/musikk/anmeldelser/musikkanmeldelser/hellbillies/24536034 |title=Hellbillies fant lykka i Oslo Spektrum |language=Norwegian |first=Øyvind |last=Rønning |publisher=[[Dagbladet]] |date=2012-11-25 |accessdate=2013-10-16}}</ref>

Their lyrics are written and sung in the dialect of the [[Hallingdal]] area of Norway and there is evidence of influence from traditional (folk) Norwegian music, giving a distinctive "Norwegian" flavor to their country music.

Their early albums often included songs originally recorded by country music artists from the US with Hellbillies writing new lyrics in Norwegian. Later efforts have included much more original material that reflect contemporary Norwegian people and Norwegian life and issues. They have also gradually changed their musical style from country to rock.

They have collaborated with musicians from the [[United States|US]]. For example, [[Rob Hajacos]] from [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], who plays [[fiddle]] on most [[Garth Brooks]] albums,  plays on three of Hellbillies’ albums.

In 2013 Hellbillies appeared at the [[Kongsberg Jazz Festival]] performing together with Jazz guests the Violin virtuoso [[Ola Kvernberg]] and the super trumpeter [[Mathias Eick]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kongsberg-jazzfestival.no/konsert/hellbillies-m-ola-kvernberg-mathias-eick |title=Hellbillies m./Ola Kvernberg + Mathias Eick |language=Norwegian |publisher=[[Kongsberg Jazz Festival]] |date=2013-07-05 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017091122/http://kongsberg-jazzfestival.no/konsert/hellbillies-m-ola-kvernberg-mathias-eick/ |archivedate=2013-10-17 }}</ref> In 2013 they also contributed to the book "Think like a rockstar" [http://www.publicomforlag.no/book/tenk-som-en-rockestjerne/ Tenk som en rockestjerne],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cameratravel.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/katzenjammer/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162308/https://cameratravel.wordpress.com/2013/04/25/katzenjammer/ |archivedate=2015-04-02 }}</ref> written by [[Ståle Økland]].
