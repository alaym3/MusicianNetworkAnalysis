'''The Dresden Dolls''' are an American musical duo from [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Formed in 2000, the group consists of [[Amanda Palmer]] (lead vocals and piano; additional: keyboards, harmonica, ukulele) and [[Brian Viglione]] (drums and backing vocals; additional: guitar, bass guitar). The two describe their style as "[[Bertolt Brecht|Brechtian]] [[punk rock|punk]] [[cabaret]]", a phrase invented by Palmer because she was "terrified" that the press would invent a name that "would involve the word ''[[Goth subculture|gothic]]''".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/hotstar_article.aspx?ID=61756 |title=The Dresden Dolls |author=Speer, Deborah |date=April 3, 2006 |work=[[Pollstar]] |access-date=August 8, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925035643/http://www.pollstar.com/hotstar_article.aspx?ID=61756 |archive-date=September 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The Dresden Dolls are part of an underground [[dark cabaret]] movement that started gaining momentum in the early 2000s.{{cn|date=November 2017}}

=== Band formation and name ===

[[File:Dresden Dolls3.jpg|thumb|The Dresden Dolls, 2002<br>Photo by [[Kyle Cassidy]]]]
The duo formed a week after Brian Viglione witnessed Amanda Palmer perform solo at a Halloween party in 2000. Their live performances soon gained them a cult following. During these performances the two band members often wore dramatic make-up and fancy clothing that pushed their [[cabaret]]/theater aesthetic. They encourage fans to become involved at their shows, with the fans' own [[stilt walking]], [[living statue]]s, [[fire breathing|fire breathers]], and other [[performance art]] becoming an integral part of the show. The Dirty Business Brigade coordinated the fans' performances.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedirtybusinessbrigade.net |title=Dirty Business Brigade website |work=Thedirtybusinessbrigade.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704184115/http://thedirtybusinessbrigade.net/ |archive-date=July 4, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theshadowbox.net/forum/index.php?topic=3720.msg77931#msg77931 |title=Brigade Faq |author=Amanda Palmer |work=Theshadowbox.net |date=2011-09-10 |access-date=2013-08-19 |quote=Q: What is the Dresden Dolls Brigade?    A: The Dresden Dolls Brigade is our name for an ever-changing collection of performance artists who are an integral part of our live shows. Theater groups, visual artists, dancers, and all other sorts of off-kilter performing artists are invited to create living theater and art at the various rock clubs and theaters the band inhabits, night after night, around the world. These acts may take place in or outside of the club and may be static or roving. Some acts may take place on stage (either in place of or in addition to the traditional “opening local band”) and on rare occasions may be incorporated into the band’s set itself. Our aim is to make the experience for our audience more fun, authentic, interactive, and surreal. We seek out and encourage the expression of non-traditional arts, hoping the crowd goes home with the feeling of being immersed in a unique atmosphere....walking away feeling like they were a part of our show – not just watching one. We hope our audience will take away with them with a sense of awe and wonder, and the knowledge of artistic possibilities. Most importantly, it’s a wonderful way to give a stage to a local performance artist who might otherwise have no venue in which to showcase his or her unconventional talents.}}</ref>

The band's first name was Out of Arms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dresdendolls.com/bio/bio_amanda.htm |title=Amandas Bio |work=Dresdendolls.com |access-date=September 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102092740/http://www.dresdendolls.com/bio/bio_amanda.htm |archive-date=January 2, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> At some point, the name became The Dresden Dolls. The name, according to Palmer, was "inspired by a combination of things", including the [[Bombing of Dresden in World War II|firebombing of Dresden, Germany]] and the porcelain dolls that were a hallmark of pre-war Dresden industry; an early song of the same name by [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]]; and a reference to the [[V. C. Andrews]] novel ''[[Flowers in the Attic]]'', where the classically blond-haired and blue-eyed protagonists are called "the Dresden dolls". The name also evokes [[Weimar Germany]] and its cabaret culture. Additionally, Palmer "liked the parallel between Dresden (destruction) and Dolls (innocence, delicacy), because it is very much in keeping with the dynamics of the music, which sometimes goes from a childlike whisper to a [[banshee]] scream within a few seconds".<ref>{{cite web |last=Peck |first=Stacey |url=http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_home.php?storenr=103&deptnr=119 |title=Undressing The Dresden Dolls |work=Newbury Comics |date=n.d. |access-date=September 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100805152347/http://www.newburycomics.com/rel/v2_home.php?storenr=103 |archive-date=August 5, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== Growing fame and performances ===

The duo was featured in a webcast performance at the 2002 [[Ig Nobel Prize]] ceremony in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{cite journal|date=October 4, 2002 |title=Not-so-Nobel Laureates |journal=ScienceNOW |volume=4 |issue=3 |publisher=2007 American Association for the Advancement of Science |location=Washington, DC |url=http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/1004/3 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106083341/http://sciencenow.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/2002/1004/3 |archive-date=January 6, 2006 }}</ref> After a self-promoted demo recorded and released in 2001, their first release was the mostly live compilation ''[[A Is for Accident]]'' (Important Records), followed in 2003 by a [[The Dresden Dolls (album)|self-titled debut]] produced and recorded by [[Martin Bisi]] ([[Swans (band)|Swans]], [[Sonic Youth]]) at The Old American Can Factory in [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]] after being signed to [[Roadrunner Records]] by [[David Bason]]. The album features fellow Boston-area musicians [[Ad Frank]] (guitar on "[[Good Day (The Dresden Dolls song)|Good Day]]") and [[Shawn Setaro]] (bass on "Good Day", "Gravity", and "Jeep Song").<ref>''The Dresden Dolls'' album liner notes.</ref> Two songs from the album ranked in the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2004]]: "[[Girl Anachronism]]" at number 30 and "[[Coin-Operated Boy]]" at number 12.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hottest 100 2004 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/hottest100/history/2004.htm |work=[[Triple J]] |access-date=June 11, 2007}}</ref> In 2003 they were crowned the winners of Boston's long-running [[WBCN Rock & Roll Rumble]].<ref>{{cite web|title=WBCN will rock Boston region no more|url=https://www.timesargus.com/articles/wbcn-will-rock-boston-region-no-more/|website=The Barre Montpelier Times Argus|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>

On October 6, 2005, The Dresden Dolls were interviewed by the subject of one of their songs, [[Christopher Lydon]], on the radio show ''[[Open Source (radio show)|Open Source]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.radioopensource.org/the-dresden-dolls/ |title=The Dresden Dolls |date=October 6, 2006 |work=[[Open Source (radio show)|Open Source]] |access-date=September 13, 2011}}</ref>

=== Tours, festivals, books, and theater ===

[[File:Dresden Dolls1.jpg|thumb|left|The Dresden Dolls, 2002]]
In March 2005, the duo supported [[Nine Inch Nails]] on tour. On June 5, The Dresden Dolls hosted a free concert at the [[Paradise Rock Club]] in Boston. When a [[power outage]] unexpectedly delayed their performance, city streets became a temporary stage for some of the many performers (living statues, stilt-walkers, and fire-breathers) who had come from across the world to entertain audiences. The entire event—concert and street performances—was filmed and the resulting [[DVD-Video|DVD]], ''[[Live: In Paradise]]'', was released in Europe on October 10, 2005 and in North America on November 22, shortly after the band's fall 2005 tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theshadowbox.net/ddbb/viewtopic.php?t=5059 |title=Update on The Dresden Dolls "Paradise" DVD Pre-Ord |author=Bill H. |date=September 25, 2005 |work=theshadowbox.net}}</ref>

The Dresden Dolls' second studio album, ''[[Yes, Virginia...]]'', was released on April 18, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dresdendolls.com/diary/2005/09/out-of-closet-and-into-studio.html |title=Out of the Closet and into the Studio |author=Amanda Palmer |date=September 8, 2005 |work=dresdendolls.com |access-date=September 13, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526180100/http://www.dresdendolls.com/diary/2005/09/out-of-closet-and-into-studio.html |archive-date=May 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all |author-link=Amanda Palmer }}</ref>

Over the summer of that year, the duo performed at [[South by Southwest]], [[Bonnaroo]], Britain's [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], and [[Lollapalooza]], in addition to touring with [[Panic! at the Disco]] as their [[opening act]]. During the support tour, the band presented "Fuck the Back Row—A Night of Celluloid Vaudeville". The events consisted of screenings of short films from friends and fans, performances by local artists, and a solo show by Palmer who performed mostly cover songs inspired from film soundtracks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dresdendolls.com/fuckthebackrow/index.htm |date=November 27, 2007 |title=Fuck the Back Row |author=The Dresden Dolls |work=dresdendolls.com |access-date=December 16, 2007}}</ref>

In June 2006, ''[[The Dresden Dolls Companion]]''<ref>{{cite book |author=Amanda Palmer |title=The Dresden Dolls Companion |date=June 2006 |publisher=eight-foot music publishing |isbn=978-1-57560-888-4}}</ref> was released by Amanda Palmer. The book contains a history of the band and their first album—''[[The Dresden Dolls (album)|The Dresden Dolls]]''—as well as a partial autobiography. The book also contains the lyrics, [[sheet music]], and notes on each song on the album, as well as a DVD featuring a 20-minute interview with Palmer about the origins of the band and the first LP. The interview was conducted by a friend while Palmer compiled the artwork for the first LP.

On August 16, the East Providence Community Theatre in [[East Providence, Rhode Island]] premiered a full-length, fan-written [[jukebox musical]], ''The Clockwork Waltz'', featuring songs from The Dresden Dolls' three albums. The show was encouraged by the band and their management.<ref>{{cite web

On January 14, 2007, the duo took a temporary hiatus.
