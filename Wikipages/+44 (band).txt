'''+44''' (read as '''Plus Forty-four''') was an American [[Rock music|rock]]<!--"Rock" is generally used on most band articles (see Nirvana, U2, etc) rather than more specific subgenres.--> [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] formed in Los Angeles, California in 2005. The group consisted of vocalist and bassist [[Mark Hoppus]] and drummer [[Travis Barker]] of [[Blink-182]], lead guitarist [[Shane Gallagher]] of [[The Nervous Return]], and rhythm guitarist Craig Fairbaugh of [[Mercy Killers]]. Hoppus and Barker created +44 shortly after the initial 2005 breakup of Blink-182 and before it was later reformed. The band's name refers to the [[List of country calling codes|international dialing code]] of the United Kingdom, the country where the duo first discussed the project. Early recordings were largely [[Electronic music|electronic]] in nature, and featured vocals by Carol Heller, formerly of the all-girl [[Punk rock|punk]] quartet Get the Girl.

The band's sound gradually took on a heavier tone as Hoppus and Barker purchased a studio in which to record. Although anticipated by the music press, the band's debut—the album ''[[When Your Heart Stops Beating]]'' (2006)—did not match commercial expectations and received mixed reviews from the critics. The group toured worldwide throughout 2006 and 2007, including a summer slot on the [[Honda Civic Tour]] alongside [[Fall Out Boy]]. Hoppus later began preparing material for a solo album, put plans for a second +44 album on hold in 2008, and the group entered an extended hiatus with the reunion of Blink-182 in 2009.

==History==

===Blink-182 problems and hiatus===
By 2004, Blink-182—consisting of bassist [[Mark Hoppus]], guitarist [[Tom DeLonge]], and drummer [[Travis Barker]]—had emerged as the biggest [[pop punk]] act of the era, releasing the [[Platinum album|multiplatinum]] album ''[[Enema of the State]]'' (1999) and ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (2001), which reached number one.<ref name=Kerrang05>{{cite journal| last =Browne | first =Nichola | date = November 20, 2005| title = Punk Rock!

The addition of other members to +44 came gradually. In April 2005, Barker invited his friend Carol Heller to provide vocals on a track. Formerly of the all-girl punk quartet Get the Girl, Heller traded and shared vocals with Hoppus on most of the band's early demos.<ref name="formation"/> Meanwhile, Hoppus invited friend Shane Gallagher to play the guitar on a few tracks the band began working on, and he was soon drafted as a member.<ref name="abpunkint"/> Production of the record moved along swiftly once the duo purchased their own North Hollywood studio, which they dubbed Opera Music. The space—which featured two recording rooms, a lounge, and a small outdoor courtyard—was purchased in October 2005 from former [[Poison (American band)|Poison]] guitarist [[Richie Kotzen]].<ref name=APCoverStory>{{cite journal| last = Griffin| first = JR| date = December 2006| title = Blink & You'll Miss It| journal = [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]| issue = 221| pages = 136–140| publisher = Alternative Magazines Inc.| issn = 1065-1667| url =http://www.altpress.com/magazine/issue/221_-_my_chemical_romance  | access-date =January 12, 2013 }}</ref> After moving all band gear into the new recording center, the entire direction of the band evolved into a more organic sound.<ref name="abpunkint"/> Heller became uneasy with the new direction and, with a desire to start a family, parted ways with the band by the end of the year.<ref name="abpunkint"/> Shortly afterward, friend Craig Fairbaugh came in to observe, listen, and to play songs; by the end of the day, Hoppus and Barker asked him to become the fourth member of the group.<ref name="postblink"/> The band's debut album, ''[[When Your Heart Stops Beating]]'', was produced by Hoppus and Barker, with longtime associate and friend [[Jerry Finn]] in the role of executive producer.<ref name="altpress">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_1187/|title=Plus 44 announce album title, release date|author=''Alternative Press'' staff|date=August 29, 2006|magazine=Alternative Press|access-date=April 10, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009061404/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_1187/|archive-date=2012-10-09|url-status=dead}}</ref>
