'''Air Supply''' is an Australian-English [[soft rock]] [[Musical duo|duo]] formed in [[Australia]] consisting of [[England|English]]-born singer-songwriter and guitarist [[Graham Russell]] and Australian lead vocalist [[Russell Hitchcock]]. They had a succession of hits worldwide, including eight top-ten hits in the United States in the early 1980s. They formed in 1975 and have included various accompanying musicians and singers. The [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) inducted Air Supply into their [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] on December 1, 2013, at the annual [[ARIA Music Awards of 2013|ARIA Awards]].

==History==
===Formation and early years: 1975–1980===
[[Chrissie Hammond]], Russell Hitchcock, and Graham Russell met on May 12, 1975<ref>CBS Sunday Morning 2/16/20</ref> while performing in the Australian production of the [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="SpencerAirS"/> With Hammond and Hitchcock on vocals and Russell on guitar, they formed a harmony vocal group in Melbourne, while the show was still playing.<ref name="ARDb"/> Hammond left the vocal group to form [[Cheetah (band)|Cheetah]] and was replaced by Jeremy Paul (ex-Soffrok and later [[Divinyls]]) on bass guitar and vocals in 1976.<ref name="McF"/> Together, Hitchcock, Russell and Paul formed Air Supply. The group's first single, "[[Love and Other Bruises]]", was released in November 1976 and peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart in January 1977.<ref name="Kent"/> It was followed by ''[[Air Supply (1976 album)|Air Supply]]'', their debut album, in December, which reached No.&nbsp;17 on the Kent Music Report Albums Chart and achieved [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in Australia.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="Kent"/> The album was produced by [[Peter Dawkins (musician)|Peter Dawkins]] ([[Spectrum (band)|Spectrum]], [[Ross Ryan]]) with Air Supply line-up as Hitchcock, Paul, Russell and drummer Jeff Browne, guitarist [[Mark McEntee]] and keyboardist, arranger Adrian Scott.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="SpencerAirS"/> Other singles were "If You Knew Me", "Empty Pages" and "Feel the Breeze" but none reached the Top&nbsp;40.<ref name="Kent"/> A national tour followed with Hitchcock, Paul, Russell and Scott joined by Nigel Macara (ex–[[Tamam Shud]], [[Ariel (Australian band)|Ariel]]) on drums and Brenton White (Skintight) on guitar.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="SpencerAirS"/> Brenton White rehearsed but did not perform with Air Supply.

Their second album, ''[[The Whole Thing's Started]]'', also produced by Dawkins,<ref name="ARDb"/> was released in July 1977 with White replaced on lead guitar by [[Rex Goh]].<ref name="McF"/> The album spawned the singles "Do What You Do" (June), "That's How the Whole Thing Started" (October) and "Do It Again" (February 1978) but neither album nor singles charted into the Top&nbsp;40.<ref name="Kent"/> From late 1977, the group supported [[Rod Stewart]] during his tour of Australia—he invited them to continue to the United States and Canada. Their third album, ''[[Love & Other Bruises]]'', which included re-recordings of some earlier tracks, was made mid-tour in Los Angeles in July–August and released later that year in the US on [[Columbia Records]] with Jimmy Horowitz producing.<ref name="ARDb"/> During the tour, Paul left the band, resulting in a new line-up of Hitchcock, Macara, Goh, and Russell, plus [[Joey Carbone]] on keyboards, Robin LeMesurier on co-lead guitar and Howard Sukimoto on bass guitar.<ref name="SpencerAirS"/> Paul, in 1980, recruited fellow former Air Supply bandmate McEntee in the line-up of [[Divinyls]], fronted by [[Christina Amphlett|Chrissie Amphlett]]. Air Supply performed in London supporting [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and [[Boz Scaggs]].<ref name="McF"/>

Although their music had some commercial success, Russell claimed, on a 1995 DVD, that he and Hitchcock were so poor that they checked the backs of hotel sofas for change so that they could buy bread to make toast. By early 1978, the line-up was Hitchcock, Russell, and Macara with [[George Terry (musician)|George Terry]] and Joey Murcia on guitar, George Bitzer on keyboards and Harold Cowart on bass guitar.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="SpencerAirS"/> However, by mid-1978, only Hitchcock and Russell remained in the line-up, backed by Ralph Cooper ([[Sebastian Hardie|Windchase]]) on drums and former Sailor members Brian Hamilton on bass guitar and vocals and David Moyse on guitar.<ref name="McF"/><ref name="SpencerAirS"/>

In April 1979, the band released ''[[Life Support (Air Supply album)|Life Support]]'', a [[concept album]] which included a picture disc on its first printing. The album was recorded at Trafalgar Studios in Sydney. The album had a five-and-a-half-minute version of "[[Lost in Love (Air Supply song)|Lost in Love]]", written by [[Graham Russell]] in 15 minutes; it was released as a single and peaked at No.&nbsp;13 in Australia and No.&nbsp;13 in New Zealand.<ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NZLCharts"/> The track caught the attention of [[Arista Records]] boss [[Clive Davis]], who remixed the song and released it as a single in the US early the next year. In late November 1979 Russell was embroiled in a bitter court case with Samuel Nay over accusations of assault at a backstage meet and greet in Oklahoma. Nay later died during the court case and all charges were dropped. The line-up for the album kept Hitchcock, Russell, Cooper, and Moyse, and added Criston Barker (bass) and Frank Esler-Smith (keyboards/orchestra arrangements) with help from other session musicians. Esler-Smith had previously known Hitchcock and Russell from working with them in ''Jesus Christ Superstar''.

A re-recorded and remixed version of "Lost in Love" was released internationally as a single in January 1980 on Arista Records. The associated album, ''[[Lost in Love (Air Supply album)|Lost in Love]]'', appeared in March and contained three US Top&nbsp;5 singles, including the title track which peaked at No.&nbsp;3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. The other US Top&nbsp;5 singles were "[[Every Woman in the World]]" (No.&nbsp;5) and "[[All Out of Love]]" (No.&nbsp;2).<ref name="BillboardS"/> Both singles were Top&nbsp;10 hits in Australia with "All Out of Love" reaching No.&nbsp;17 in the Netherlands and reaching No.&nbsp;11 on the United Kingdom [[UK Singles Chart|Singles Chart]].<ref name="BillboardS"/><ref name="UKCharts"/><ref name="Kent"/><ref name="NLDCharts"/> The album kept the same line-up as before, with Hitchcock, Russell, Cooper, Moyse, Barker and Esler-Smith. The album sold three million copies in the US and peaked at No.&nbsp;22 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].<ref name="BillboardA"/>

=== 1981–1990 ===

In 1981, Air Supply released ''[[The One That You Love (album)|The One That You Love]]'', produced by [[Harry Maslin]] with the [[The One That You Love|title track]] issued as a single which went to No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.<ref name="BillboardS"/> It also featured two other Top&nbsp;5 hits, "[[Here I Am (Air Supply song)|Here I Am (Just When I Thought I Was Over You)]]" and "[[Sweet Dreams (Air Supply song)|Sweet Dreams]]". A fourth single, "[[I'll Never Get Enough of You]]" was released in Japan and achieved Top 10 status. During the recording for this album, Barker left and was replaced by David Green. Also, previous Air Supply guitarist [[Rex Goh]] returned for the album, co-writing "I Want to Give It All" with Russell.

Russell and Hitchcock also from time to time were relief hosts on the music program ''[[Solid Gold (TV series)|Solid Gold]]''. It is believed that they initially filled in when [[Andy Gibb]] was a no show for an episode that they performed on. However, Gibb's "no shows" soon became more frequent, which resulted in his termination. Even though this was not their usual job, the duo made an impression on producers and the audience who enjoyed their accents, and they were asked to host every so often until the show was cancelled.

Their next album ''[[Now and Forever (Air Supply album)|Now and Forever]]'', released in 1982 with the same seven-piece line-up (Hitchcock, Russell, Moyse, Goh, Esler-Smith, Green and Cooper), continued the group's popularity with the Top&nbsp;5 hit "[[Even the Nights Are Better]]" and two Top&nbsp;40 singles, "[[Young Love (Air Supply song)|Young Love]]" and "[[Two Less Lonely People in the World]]".

In 1983, they released their ''[[Greatest Hits (1983 Air Supply album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album with a new single, "[[Making Love Out of Nothing at All]]", written by [[Jim Steinman]]. The song was one of their biggest hits ever spending three weeks at No.&nbsp;2, and the album eventually sold 7 million copies.

That same year, Air Supply also released their first live video, ''Air Supply Live in Hawaii''. In 1984, their song "I Can Wait Forever" which was co-written with [[David Foster]], was featured in a scene of the blockbuster movie ''[[Ghostbusters]]'', and was included in the soundtrack album.

By the mid-1980s, Goh, Moyse, and Green had all left the line-up, and the band's 1985 [[Air Supply (1985 album)|self-titled album]] featured Don Cromwell and former [[The Babys|Babys]] member [[Wally Stocker]] filling the bass and guitar roles, respectively. This album included a Top&nbsp;20 ''Billboard'' hit with "[[Just as I Am (Air Supply song)|Just as I Am]]" as well as a cover of the [[Jennifer Rush]] song "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)|The Power of Love]]". The band then had a couple of minor hits ("[[Lonely Is the Night (Air Supply song)|Lonely Is the Night]]" and "One More Chance") from the album ''[[Hearts in Motion]]'' released in 1986.

Russell and Hitchcock recorded a 1987 ''[[The Christmas Album (Air Supply album)|Christmas Album]]'' (containing the holiday single "The Eyes of a Child") before taking a break as a band. During this time, Hitchcock released his [[Russell Hitchcock (album)|self-titled album]] in 1988 which was not a big seller. However, the single "[[Swear to Your Heart]]" in 1990 – from the movie soundtrack for ''[[Arachnophobia (film)|Arachnophobia]]'' – received significant airplay and reached the Top 10 on the US Adult Contemporary chart.

=== 1991–2000 ===
On 21 August 1989, using their old producer and welcoming the return of drummer Ralph Cooper, the duo decided to enter the studio again to record ''The Earth Is'', which was released in 1991 by [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]] under [[Warner Bros. Records]]. The recording contains their hit single "[[Without You (Badfinger song)|Without You]]," along with singles for "Stronger Than the Night" (with a music video announcing that Air Supply was back) and "Stop the Tears" and the album sold more than one million copies. Inside the album is a note about Hitchcock and Russell's original Musical Director of their meeting place during  ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' (and long time Band Member/Orchestrator): "This Album Is Dedicated to the Memory of Frank Esler-Smith."  Esler-Smith had died earlier that year (1991) from pneumonia.

The official fan club released ''The Earth Is World Tour'' video, a rare collector's item that contains live footage from the band's global tour in support of the album.

The album was followed by ''[[The Vanishing Race]]'' in 1993,<ref name="AusCharts"/> which was supported by the hit single "[[Goodbye (Air Supply song)|Goodbye]]", with lyrics by [[David Foster]] and [[Linda Thompson (actress)|Linda Thompson]]—which, although not popular in the United States, was critically praised and gained a large following outside the country, especially in Asia, where in many countries it reached number No.&nbsp;1. In [[Taiwan]], Power Station & Terry Lin (a huge fan of Air Supply himself) covered it and cleverly called it "I'd rather love the sea/Shanghai rather than loving you" as a play on Shanghai's geographical relationship with the sea in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtLzqbhnS24&list=FLh-uwhJyg1u_oms9kjMMgbg&index=2&feature=plpp_video|title=動力火車&林志炫 愛上你不如愛上海|last=1230456qaz14|date=8 February 2010|via=YouTube}}</ref> This led to another world tour in 1993 which included [[Earth, Wind & Fire]] guitarist [[Dick Smith (musician)|Dick Smith]].  "It's Never Too Late" was another single released from the ''Vanishing Race''. The album itself was dedicated to the plight of the [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], the "Vanishing Race" of the album's title, and the album sold 4 million copies.

Their third album of the decade, ''News from Nowhere'', was released in 1995. It contained the Asian hit singles "Someone", "Always", and a cover of "[[Unchained Melody]]".

Their popularity continued to soar in Southeast Asian countries, culminating in the release of ''Now and Forever: Greatest Hits Live'', a CD and DVD recording of a live concert in [[Taipei]], Taiwan, also in 1995, which stayed at the top of the Asian album charts for 16 weeks.

===2001–2011===
[[File:Air Supply Live in the Philippines.jpg|thumb|220px|Air Supply at the Subic Convention Center, Philippines, on June 12, 2008]]
They continued to tour heavily throughout Asia and in select venues in the US, and continued to release the more [[adult contemporary]] titled ''The Book of Love'' (1997), ''Yours Truly'' (2001), and ''Across the Concrete Sky'' (2003). In 2005, they released a live CD/DVD recording, and performed in [[Havana]], Cuba, becoming one of the first foreign bands invited to perform in the country. They were booked to perform two concerts, and played the first show on July 7., the day before [[Hurricane Dennis]] hit the country. In high winds, their first concert had an audience of 175,000. Due to the hurricane, they could not play the second show. Fans staying at the same hotel as Air Supply on July 8. had to be content with Russell performing acoustically for them, as there was no electricity. Their songs were featured in ''[[Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. & Mrs. Smith]]'', ''[[The Wedding Date]]'' and ''[[Bad Company (2002 film)|Bad Company]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In 2006, they released an acoustic album, ''The Singer and the Song'', and were gearing up for the release of their first studio album in three years, ''Zed''. In support of the acoustic album, they made their first trip to India in May 2006. On December 2, 2006, the duo performed to a capacity crowd in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. This was their second visit to Jamaica, having performed at the Air Jamaica Jazz and Blues Festival in January 2006. They also have been seen endorsing [[Time–Life]]'s ''Classic Soft-Rock Collection''. In 2007, Russell released his first adult contemporary solo album called ''The Future''.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Russell made an appearance in ''[[Believe (2007 film)|Believe]]'', a comedy about [[multi-level marketing]]. In 2008, based on their chart performance, they were ranked the 83rd best musical act of all time in ''Billboard'' Hot 100's 50th anniversary edition. They appeared on ''Don't Forget the Lyrics'' on December 19, 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In May 2010, Air Supply released ''[[Mumbo Jumbo (album)|Mumbo Jumbo]]'', the duo's first studio recording in eight years. It was 
recorded at Graham Russell's home studio near Park City, Utah and at Odds On Records' state of the art facilities in Las Vegas with top session musicians and an orchestra. ''Mumbo Jumbo'' was produced by Russell and engineered by Odds On's Sean O'Dwyer, whose credits include Pink Floyd, Randy Newman and Blink-182. Among the 14 tracks was the first single "[[Dance with Me (Air Supply song)|Dance with Me]]", which reached number 28 on the ''Billboard'' Adult Contemporary chart and "Faith in Love", which charted at number 30 on the same chart.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

The music video for "[[All Out of Love]]" is seen briefly in the 2010 Australian film ''[[Animal Kingdom (film)|Animal Kingdom]]''.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In 2014, Air Supply were approached by the [[Wideboys]] to [[remix]] their single "Desert Sea Sky". Penned by Russell, the track received the royal studio treatment by the UK remix duo, who created multiple versions of the song for promotion across the board to ''Billboard'' dance club DJs, clubs, radio stations and the ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs chart. On  December 2, 2014, Evolution Music Group released Air Supply's first high-definition concert film, ''Air Supply - Live in Hong Kong'' on their evosound label. The title was released on blu-ray, DVD, CD and LP formats. The concert was recorded on August 11, 2013 at Asia World-Expo, Hong Kong.  The concert featured performances of new songs, "Desert Sea Sky", "[[Dance with Me (Air Supply song)|Dance with Me]]" and "I Won't Stop Living You", alongside their classic hits.

In 2015, "I Want You" reached number 35 on the ''Billboard'' Dance Club Songs chart for the week ending September 26, 2015.  That same month they released the single "I Adore You".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Air-Supply-Shares-Dynamic-Video-for-New-Single-I-Adore-You-20150922|title=Air Supply Shares Dynamic Video for New Single 'I Adore You'|author=BWW News Desk|access-date=May 24, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624171523/http://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwmusic/article/Air-Supply-Shares-Dynamic-Video-for-New-Single-I-Adore-You-20150922|archive-date=June 24, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>
