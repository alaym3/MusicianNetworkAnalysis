[[File:Zac Efron 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Efron at the [[Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards 2007|2007 Nickelodeon Australian Kids' Choice Awards]]]]

Efron began acting in the early 2000s with guest roles on several television series including ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 13, 2011 |title=Before The Fame: Zac Efron In Cute Guest Appearance! |url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/zac-efron-in-firefly_n_835018 |access-date=September 4, 2019 |website=HuffPost}}</ref> ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', and ''[[The Guardian (TV series)|The Guardian]]''. In 2004, he began appearing as a recurring character in the first season of the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] series ''[[Summerland (TV series)|Summerland]]''.<ref name="Boren">{{Cite web |last=Boren |first=Jade |date=April 30, 2019 |title=Zac Efron Confesses He Ruined His First On-Screen Kiss In A Really Gross Way — Watch |url=https://hollywoodlife.com/2019/04/30/zac-efron-first-onscreen-kiss-seafood-summerland-kay-panabaker-interview/ |access-date=September 4, 2019 |website=Hollywood Life}}</ref> For the show's second season, which aired in 2005, he was promoted to the main cast. He also appeared in some films, including the [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]] television film ''[[Miracle Run]]'' (2004), for which he earned a [[Young Artist Award]] nomination for his performance as one of two autistic twins.

Efron's career reached a turning point with the teen musical television film ''[[High School Musical]]'' (2006), which premiered on the [[Disney Channel]] in January 2006. The film, which has been described as a modern adaptation of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', saw Efron playing the male lead Troy Bolton, a high school basketball player who feels conflicted when he finds himself interested in participating in the school musical with Gabriella Montez ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), a girl from the scholastic decathlon team. The film, which also starred [[Ashley Tisdale]], [[Lucas Grabeel]], [[Corbin Bleu]], and [[Monique Coleman]] in pivotal roles, became a major success and helped Efron gain recognition among teenage audiences. The film's soundtrack was certified quadruple platinum by the [[RIAA]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=RIA Gold & Platinum |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091231133408/http://riaa.com/goldandplatinum.php |archive-date=December 31, 2009 |access-date=December 17, 2008}}</ref> making it one of the best-selling albums of the year in the United States. Efron's singing talents were disputed when it was revealed that his voice had been blended with [[Drew Seeley]]'s on the soundtrack, but Efron clarified that the songs (written for a tenor) were written before he was cast and therefore did not suit his more baritone vocal range. In his subsequent musical films, Efron did his own singing.

Efron was next seen playing the role of Link Larkin in the musical comedy film ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'' (2007), based on the [[Hairspray (musical)|2002 Broadway musical of the same name]].

Later that year, he was seen reprising his role of Troy Bolton in ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' (2007), which aired on the Disney Channel in August 2007.

Efron reprised his role of Troy Bolton in ''[[High School Musical 3: Senior Year]]'' (2008), the first film in the ''High School Musical'' franchise to receive a theatrical release. The film became a major blockbuster at the box office, and received mixed to positive reviews from critics. He followed this with the commercially successful comedy ''[[17 Again (film)|17 Again]]'' (2009) about a 37-year-old man ([[Matthew Perry]]) who is transformed into his 17-year-old self (Efron) after a chance accident.
