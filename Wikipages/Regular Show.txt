The series revolves around the lives of two [[working-class]] friends, a [[blue jay]] named Mordecai and a [[raccoon]] named Rigby{{mdash}}both employed as groundskeepers at a local park. They usually try to solve a simple problem that leads to a surreal, extreme, and often supernatural misadventure.

The project premiered on September 6, 2010 on Cartoon Network.

As of May 2013, the program had been watched by approximately 2 to 2.5 million viewers each week. The series has received positive reviews from critics and has developed a following of all ages. ''Regular Show'' has been nominated for several awards, including seven [[Annie Award]]s, six [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s—one of which it won for the episode "Eggscellent" (season 3, episode 18)—and three [[British Academy Children's Awards]]. A film based on the series, titled ''[[Regular Show: The Movie]]'', premiered in 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/regular-show-the-movie/id1025333882 |title=Regular Show, The Movie on iTunes |publisher=Itunes.apple.com |date=2015-09-01 |access-date=2016-04-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130202303/https://itunes.apple.com/us/tv-season/regular-show-the-movie/id1025333882 |archive-date=November 30, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Premise==
{{main|List of Regular Show characters}}
[[File:Regular Show.png|thumb|right|From left to right: Pops, Benson, Skips, Rigby, Mordecai, Muscle Man and Hi-Five Ghost]]
The series revolves around the daily lives of two 23-year-old friends, Mordecai (a [[blue jay]]), and Rigby (a [[raccoon]]). They work as groundskeepers at a [[park]], and spend their days trying to avoid work and entertain themselves by any means.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Power |series=Regular Show |network=Cartoon Network |airdate=September 6, 2010 |season=1 |number=1 |quote='''Mordecai''': Dude, we're 23 years old, we shouldn't be busting holes in walls.}}</ref> This is much to the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson (a gumball machine) and their coworker Skips (a [[yeti]]), but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Other coworkers include an overweight green male called Muscle Man, and a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost.

==Creation==
[[File:JoelQuintel.PNG|thumb|left|200px|[[J. G. Quintel]], creator of the show, and voice of Mordecai (and Hi-Five Ghost in seasons 2–8), based the show on his student films produced at CalArts]]
''Regular Show'' largely grew out of creator J. G. Quintel's life and experiences in college. Quintel attended the California Institute of the Arts, and many of the characters on ''Regular Show'' are based on the characters developed for his student films ''[[The Naïve Man from Lolliland]]'' (2005) and ''[[2 in the AM PM]]'' (2006). Both originated as part of a game called "48-hour films", in which students put words into a hat, pulled out one word at midnight and spent a weekend developing ideas for a film. Quintel attended college with [[Thurop Van Orman]] and [[Pendleton Ward]], who both went on to work at [[Cartoon Network Studios]] with Quintel; Van Orman created  ''[[The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack]]'' and Ward created ''[[Adventure Time]]''. Quintel concurrently worked on ''[[Camp Lazlo]]'' and as creative director on  ''The Marvelous Misadventures of Flapjack'' while completing his degree. He was later invited to pitch for Cartoon Network's ''[[Cartoonstitute]]'', a project to showcase short films created without the interference of network executives and [[focus testing]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Aaron H. |last=Bynum |title=CN Upfront 2008: 'The Cartoonstitute' Announcement |url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1688 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105022346/http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=1688 |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 5, 2009 |publisher=Animation Insider |date=April 3, 2008 |access-date=June 20, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=beat/>

J. G. Quintel returned to the characters from his films, put them together with newer characters and created a pilot.<ref name=beat/> Quintel wanted to present a visual pitch rather than a verbal one, believing the idea would make little sense otherwise. He storyboarded the idea for the pilot, and [[Craig McCracken]] and [[Rob Renzetti]] liked his presentation.<ref name="animag1">{{cite magazine|author=Ramin Zahed|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/people/the-sublime-madness-of-j-g-quintel/|title=The Sublime Madness of J.G.

He liked the design and developed the character of Rigby to be far less responsible than his companion.<ref name=mtv/>

The show is inspired by some British television series and video games. Episodes are produced using storyboarding and hand-drawn animation, and each episode takes roughly nine months to create. Quintel recruited several independent comic book artists to draw the show's animated elements; their style matched closely with Quintel's ideas for the series. The show's soundtrack comprises original music composed by [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] as well as [[Licensed Property|licensed]] songs. While preparing for the beginning of the show, Quintel looked for young, independent comic artists to compose the show's storyboard artists; he thought that the style would closely match that of ''Regular Show''. He looked through blogs and convention panels for the "total package", which he said was the ability to write and draw; something that many independent comic book artists possess. In addition, Quintel attended many open shows at CalArts{{mdash}}an eight-hour festival of student animation.<ref name="beat">{{cite web|url=http://comicsbeat.com/interview-regular-show-creator-jg-quintel-on-indie-comics-and-cartoons/|title=Interview: ''Regular Show'' Creator JG Quintel on Indie Comics and Cartoons|first=Shannon|last=O'Leary|date=May 16, 2012|publisher=The Beat|access-date=July 15, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006103735/http://comicsbeat.com/interview-regular-show-creator-jg-quintel-on-indie-comics-and-cartoons/|archive-date=October 6, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> The style and sensibility of ''Regular Show'' was difficult to work with in the beginning; the artists struggled to create a natural, sitcom-like sound for the series.<ref name=animag1/>

''Regular Show'' was inspired by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'', and Quintel credited the stylistic elements of [[Joe Murray (animator)|Joe Murray]]'s ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'' and ''Camp Lazlo'' as working their way into his style.<ref name=animag1/> Video games ''[[Street Fighter]]'', ''[[Shadowrun]]'' and ''[[ToeJam & Earl]]''—which Quintel played when he was a child—inspired the series, as did some [[British television]] programs. Quintel's interest in British television was influenced by his British roommate at CalArts, who introduced him to ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'', ''[[The IT Crowd]]'', ''[[Little Britain]]'', ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' and ''[[The Mighty Boosh]]''; the latter was very influential to Quintel and would later influence the humor in ''Regular Show''.<ref name=beat/>

==Production==

===Writing===
The plots of ''Regular Show'' episodes generally begin with a basic problem that the characters must overcome. While the protagonists work on their task, a magical, supernatural, or strange element appears and complicates the initially simple problem.<ref name="wired" /> The writers decided to follow this narrative structure to take advantage of the animation.<ref name="wired" />

The series is rated [[TV Parental Guidelines|TV-PG-V]].<ref name="wired" /> Cartoon Network told Quintel early on that they wanted to "age it up from the TV-Y7 stuff we'd been doing in the past". This direction led the crew to use adult-oriented humor with innuendos and drug and alcohol references. One of the program's storyboard artists, Calvin Wong, said that he enjoys the limitations set by writing for the show since the adult-oriented jokes that are approved are satisfying.<ref name="mtv">{{cite web|author=Charles Webb|url=http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/04/03/interview-regular-show-jg-quintel/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513054133/http://geek-news.mtv.com/2012/04/03/interview-regular-show-jg-quintel/|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 13, 2012|title=Interview: ''The Regular Show'' Creator J.G. Quintel|date=April 3, 2012|access-date=July 15, 2012|publisher=[[MTV News]]}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=November 2021}}

The plots of the episodes were influenced by the writers' and Quintel's personal experiences, such as performing prank telephone calls or accepting an eating challenge from a restaurant. The show often references 1980s culture, using music and electronic devices from that era because many factors from the decade left a positive influence on Quintel.<ref name="wired" /> The show also makes references to modern social trends such as [[viral video|viral internet videos]].<ref name="wired" />

===Voice cast===
{{multiple image |total_width=400

 | image2 = Steve Blum at the Code Gaess Premiere2.jpg
 | footer = The series employs the voice acting talents of [[Mark Hamill]] (''left'') and [[Steven Blum]] (''right''), among others}}

The voice acting of the series is relatively low-key, and the intention was to make most of the characters sound natural and conversational.<ref name="wired"/> Quintel wanted to make the show listenable and given contrast to most other cartoons, which often are difficult for adults to listen to. The main cast consists of voice acting veterans [[Mark Hamill]], who portrays Skips and [[Roger Craig Smith]], who plays Thomas. [[William Salyers]] plays the voice of Rigby, Janie Haddad portrays Margaret and Quintel's former CalArts classmate Sam Marin voices Benson, Pops, and Muscle Man.<ref name="wired"/> Quintel portrays Mordecai and Hi-Five Ghost.<ref name="wired"/> Members of the production staff have voiced several characters throughout the series; these include Minty Lewis, Toby Jones, Andress Salaff, and Matt Price. The ''Regular Show'' cast recorded their lines together in group as opposed to individual recording sessions for each actor; this helped make the show's dialogue sound natural. The series regularly used guest voice actors for recurring characters; these guests include [[Steven Blum]], [[Courtenay Taylor]], [[David Ogden Stiers]], [[Robin Atkin Downes]], [[Jeff Bennett]], [[Jennifer Hale]], [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]], [[Fred Tatasciore]], [[Matthew Yang King]], and [[Julian Holloway]].

===Animation===
Each episode of ''Regular Show'' took about nine months to complete. Quintel and his 35-member team developed each episode at [[Cartoon Network Studios]] in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name="Hanford">{{cite news|title=Hanford High's JG Quintel Has Cartoon Career|first=Rick|last=Bentley|newspaper=[[The Fresno Bee]]|date=October 30, 2011|access-date=March 13, 2012|url=http://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/news/2011/10/31/5895030.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012012439/http://callcenterinfo.tmcnet.com/news/2011/10/31/5895030.htm|archive-date=October 12, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cartoon Network Brings the Funny to WonderCon 2012 |date=March 8, 2012 |work=Action Figure Insider |publisher=actionfigureinsider.com |access-date=March 13, 2012 |url=http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/main/cartoon-network-brings-the-funny-to-wondercon-2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311213922/http://www.actionfigureinsider.com/main/cartoon-network-brings-the-funny-to-wondercon-2012 |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The script was illustrated in rough hand-drawn images, known as [[storyboard]]s.<ref name="animag2">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/a-day-in-the-life/issue-209-j-g-quintel/|title=A Day in the Life of J.G.Quintel|date=August 2010|access-date=July 15, 2012|magazine=[[Animation Magazine]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111102132002/http://www.animationmagazine.net/a-day-in-the-life/issue-209-j-g-quintel/|archive-date=November 2, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref> The storyboards were then animated and mixed with the corresponding dialogue to create the [[animatic]], which was then sent to be approved by the network. The show's assets (backgrounds, character designs, props) were then assembled to be sent to [[Saerom Animation]] in South Korea, where the actual animation production of the episode was performed. When finished, the episode was sent to Sabre Media Studios back in California. Music and sound effects were created and the final episode is mixed and completed. The process allowed the production team to work concurrently on dozens of episodes at different stages of production.

Although most modern animation had switched to [[Graphics tablet|hybrid methods]] such as the [[Wacom (company)|Cintiq]], ''Regular Show'' was described as "far more low-fi", and was animated traditionally by hand using paper which was then digitally composited and painted with [[digital ink and paint]]. Although Cintiqs were initially optioned to be used for the program, Quintel stated that he felt more comfortable working on paper, considering it to be more organic and more representative of each artist's individual style. Board artist Calvin Wong said, "the tools of the trade as being pencils, pens, white out and occasionally light boxes and electric erasers".<ref name=beat/>

===Music===
[[File:Devomark.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Musician [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] works as the main composer of the show]]

''Regular Show'' has no regular theme music; instead, at the beginning of each episode, a blurred sound (provided by Quintel) followed by a ticking clock is heard over the title cards.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} The main composer of the series is [[Mark Mothersbaugh]], one of the founding members of the band [[Devo]]. As Quintel was developing the pilot he considered asking Mothersbaugh to create the music for the show. The episode's animatic was sent to Mothersbaugh along with a request for him to join the show's staff and crew.

''Regular Show'' occasionally made use of licensed songs{{mdash}}mostly from the 1980s; this began when Quintel and the staff writers started recording the animatics using copyrighted songs for the montage scenes. The network executives watched the animatic and asked the crew if they wanted to use some of the songs for the finished episodes.<ref name="wired"/> Quintel said that the songs are chosen for their suitability for the scene, whether they sound good and are affordable. Quintel enjoyed using the songs in the episodes because adult viewers might have remembered them and younger viewers might appreciate older music.<ref name="wired"/> Songs have included "[[You're the Best Around]]", "[[Mississippi Queen]]" and "[[A Holly Jolly Christmas]]".<ref name="wired"/> The show also used several songs not from the 80s, such as "[[Pale Blue Eyes]]" by [[The Velvet Underground]] from the movie and "[["Heroes" (David Bowie song)|Heroes]]" by [[David Bowie]] from the series finale. Another notable song used in the show is "Here Comes a Regular" by [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], a band often considered as underground.

The show also produceed original songs which were used in episodes. These are generally composed by Mothersbaugh and written by one of the staff's storyboard artists.<ref name="wired"/> "Summertime Loving, Loving in the Summer (Time)" was written by the staff member Sean Szeles and appeared in the episode "This Is My Jam" (season 2, episode 13).<ref name="wired"/>

===Critical reception===
{{quotebox|quote="What I like best about ''Regular Show'' is that in the midst of a gaggle of memorable regular characters, zany recurring minor characters, and a fantastical animation style, it still manages to create motifs for its condensed themes."  |source= Kevin McFarland, ''[[The A.V.

''Regular Show'' received critical acclaim. A reviewer from ''[[IGN]]'', R.L. Shaffer, called the show zany, absurd, bizarre, and hilarious. He praised the show's writing, and said that it included "snappy dialogue, odd characters, and clever stories{{mdash}}each more irrelevant than the last{{mdash}}''Regular Show'' never ceases to tickle the funny bone".<ref name="IGN"/> He finished his review by calling the show "a pretty awesome piece of refreshing off-the-wall comedy" and wrote that it's "humorously animated, brazenly silly and almost always funny".<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|author=R.L.

''DVD Talk'''s Neil Lumbrad described the show as "offbeat sense of humor with a lot of randomness that makes its title both peculiar and hilarious" and compared it to the original ''[[Looney tunes|Looney Tunes]]'' shorts and other cartoons{{mdash}}including ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'', ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'', and ''[[Johnny Bravo]]''{{mdash}}which Cartoon Network has produced. He wrote that the network has found "animated gold with ''Regular Show'', which is too offbeat and unique to be called regular" and that it is a "comedic animated gem worthy of being discovered for years to come".<ref name=dvdtalk/> Lumbrad ended his review by recommending the show and calling it "one truly awesome cartoon with a lot of good humor to enjoy."<ref name=dvdtalk>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/61279/regular-show-season-1-season-2/|title=Regular Show: Season 1 & Season 2 (Blu-ray)|author=Neil Lumbrad|date=July 16, 2013|work=DVD Talk|access-date=July 19, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715182018/http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/61279/regular-show-season-1-season-2/|archive-date=July 15, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

''[[The A.V.

Kevin McFarland, also of ''The A.V. Club'', said that he considers the series a thrill to watch; he complemented the animation style, the characters, and the use of motifs.<ref name=av2/>
