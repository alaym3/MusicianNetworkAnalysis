'''Samuel George Davis Jr.''' (December 8, 1925&nbsp;– May 16, 1990) was an American singer, dancer, actor, [[Vaudeville|vaudevillian]], and comedian.

At age three, Davis began his career in vaudeville with his father [[Sammy Davis Sr.]] and the [[Will Mastin Trio]], which toured nationally, and his film career began in 1933. After military service, Davis returned to the trio and became an overnight sensation following a nightclub performance at [[Ciro's]] (in [[West Hollywood]]) after the [[24th Academy Awards|1951 Academy Awards]]. With the trio, he became a recording artist. In 1954, at the age of 29, he lost his left eye in a car accident. Several years later, he converted to [[Judaism]], finding commonalities between the oppression experienced by [[African-American]] and Jewish communities.<ref name="biography1">[http://www.biography.com/people/sammy-davis-jr-9268223 Sammy Davis Jr. Biography]. Biography.com. Retrieved June 6, 2013.</ref>

He had a starring role on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in ''[[Mr. Wonderful (musical)|Mr. Wonderful]]'' with [[Chita Rivera]] (1956). In 1960, he appeared in the [[Rat Pack]] film ''[[Ocean's 11]]''. He returned to the stage in 1964 in a musical adaptation of [[Clifford Odets]]' ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]]'' opposite Paula Wayne. Davis was nominated for a [[Tony Award]] for his performance.The show featured the first interracial kiss on Broadway.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Paula Wayne, Golden-Voiced Broadway Star of Golden Boy, Dead at 84|url=https://www.broadway.com/buzz/194019/paula-wayne-golden-voiced-broadway-star-of-golden-boy-dead-at-84/|access-date=2020-11-21|website=Broadway.com|language=en}}</ref> In 1966, he had his own TV variety show, titled ''The Sammy Davis Jr. Show''. While Davis's career slowed in the late 1960s, his biggest hit, "[[The Candy Man]]", reached the top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in June 1972, and he became a star in Las Vegas, earning him the nickname "Mister Show Business".<ref>Casey Kasem's American Top 40 – The 70's from April 29 & May 6, 1972</ref><ref>[http://www.legacy.com/ns/news-story.aspx?id=893 Sammy Davis Jr.: Mr. Show Business]. Legacy.com. Retrieved February 2, 2013.</ref>

Davis's popularity helped break the race barrier of the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] entertainment industry.<ref name="Kashner"/> He did however have a complex relationship with the black community and drew criticism after publicly supporting President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1972. One day on a golf course with [[Jack Benny]], he was asked what his [[Handicap (golf)|handicap]] was. "Handicap?" he asked. "Talk about handicap.

After reuniting with [[Frank Sinatra]] and [[Dean Martin]] in 1987, Davis toured with them and [[Liza Minnelli]] internationally, before his death in 1990. He died in debt to the [[Internal Revenue Service]],<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=94640586 Sammy Davis, Jr.'s 'Music, Money, Madness'] – NPR</ref> and his estate was the subject of legal battles after the death of his wife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestreet.com/story/10749525/1/legalzoom-will-upheld-in-sammy-davis-jr-estate-battle.html|title=LegalZoom Will Upheld In Sammy Davis, Jr. Estate Battle|work=GlobeNewswire|date=May 6, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719024334/https://www.thestreet.com/story/10749525/1/legalzoom-will-upheld-in-sammy-davis-jr-estate-battle.html|archive-date=2018-07-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> Davis was awarded the [[Spingarn Medal]] by the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Emmy Award]] for his television performances. He was a recipient of the [[Kennedy Center Honors]] in 1987, and in 2001, he was posthumously awarded the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]].

==Early life==
Davis was born on December 8, 1925, in the [[Harlem]] section of [[Manhattan]] in New York City, the son of African-American entertainer and stage performer [[Sammy Davis Sr.]] (1900–1988) and tap dancer and stage performer [[Elvera Sanchez]] (1905–2000).<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E5DB1239F93BA3575AC0A9669C8B63 |title=Obituary: Elvera Davis, 95, Tap Dancer And Mother of Sammy Davis Jr.|date=September 8, 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=September 18, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180330193938/https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/08/arts/elvera-davis-95-tap-dancer-and-mother-of-sammy-davis-jr.html?mtrref=web.archive.org&mtrref=web.archive.org
|archive-date=2018-03-30}}</ref> During his lifetime, Davis stated that his mother was Puerto Rican and born in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]]. However, in the 2003 biography ''In Black and White'', author [[Wil Haygood]] wrote that Davis's mother was born in New York City to Cuban parents who were of [[Afro-Cuban]] background, and that Davis claimed he was Puerto Rican because he feared anti-Cuban backlash would hurt his record sales.<ref>{{cite news | title=What Made Sammy Dance? | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005947,00.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114161328/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1005947,00.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=January 14, 2010 | work=Time | date=October 23, 2003 | access-date=May 14, 2008}}</ref><ref name=Haygood516>{{cite book | url = https://archive.org/details/inblackwhitelife00haygo/page/516 | access-date = April 29, 2006 | title = In Black and White: The Life of Sammy Davis Junior | first = Wil | last = Haygood | publisher = A.

As an infant, he was reared by his paternal grandmother. When he was three years old, his parents separated. His father, not wanting to lose custody of his son, took him on tour.

Davis learned to dance from his father and his godfather [[Will Mastin]]. Davis joined the act as a child, and they became the [[Will Mastin Trio]]. Throughout his career, Davis included the Will Mastin Trio in his billing. Mastin and his father shielded him from racism by, e.g., explaining race-based snubs as jealousy. However, when Davis served in the [[United States Army]] during World War II, he was confronted by strong prejudice. He later said: "Overnight the world looked different. It wasn't one color any more. I could see the protection I'd gotten all my life from my father and Will. I appreciated their loving hope that I'd never need to know about prejudice and hate, but they were wrong. It was as if I'd walked through a swinging door for 18 years, a door which they had always secretly held open."<ref name="DavisBoyar2000">{{cite book | last1 = Davis | first1 = Sammy Jr. | last2 = Boyar | first2 = Jane |last3=Boyar|first3=Burt|title=Sammy: An Autobiography: with Material Newly Revised from Yes I Can and Why Me? | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yugNi3r5mIYC&pg=PA46|access-date=17 August 2017|year=2000|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=978-0-374-29355-0|pages=46–}}</ref> At age seven, Davis played the title role in the film ''[[Rufus Jones for President]]'', in which he sang and danced with [[Ethel Waters]].<ref>[https://search.proquest.com/docview/1745068321 "Rufus Jones for President"], ''British Film Institute'', (1933)</ref> He lived for several years in Boston's [[South End, Boston|South End]] and reminisced years later about "hoofing and singing" at [[Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille]].<ref name="Boston">{{cite news|last1=Santosuosso|first1=Ernie|title=Sammy Davis Jr., Entertainer for Six Decades, Dies at 64|work=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=May 17, 1990}}</ref>

==Career==
After his discharge, Davis rejoined the family dance act, which played at clubs around [[Portland, Oregon]]. He also recorded [[blues]] songs for [[Capitol Records]] in 1949 under the pseudonyms Shorty Muggins and Charlie Green.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eagle|first1=Bob L.|last2=Leblanc|first2=Eric|title=Blues: A Regional Experience|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZNfAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA260|access-date=January 15, 2016|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=261|isbn=9780313344244}}</ref>

On March 23, 1951, the Will Mastin Trio appeared at [[Ciro's]] as the opening act for headliner [[Janis Paige]]. They were to perform for only 20 minutes, but the reaction from the celebrity-filled crowd was so enthusiastic, especially when Davis launched into his impressions, that they performed for nearly an hour, and Paige insisted the order of the show be flipped.<ref name="Kashner">{{cite news |last1=Kashner |first1=Sam |title=The Color of Love |url=https://www.vanityfair.com/style/1999/03/sammy-davis-kim-novak-dating |access-date=6 October 2019 |work=Vanity Fair |date=September 2013 |language=en}}</ref> Davis began to achieve success on his own and was singled out for praise by critics, releasing several albums.<ref>E.g. ''Billboard'', July 25, 1953, p. 11.</ref>

In 1953, Davis was offered his own television show on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], ''Three for the Road—with the Will Mastin Trio''.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=April 9, 1953|title=Report Sammy Davis Signs $100,000 TV Pact|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrsDAAAAMBAJ&q=jet+1953+sammy+davis+television+show&pg=PA59|journal=Jet|volume=3|issue=22|pages=59}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|date=July 30, 1953|title=Forecast: Sammy Davis In 3-D|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lkIDAAAAMBAJ&q=jet+1953+sammy+davis+television+show&pg=PA11|magazine=Jet|volume=4|issue=12|pages=11}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/inblackwhitelife00haygo/page/148|title=In Black and White: The Life of Sammy Davis, Jr.|last=Haygood|first=Wil|publisher=New York : A.A.

In 1958, Davis was hired to crown the winner of the Miss [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] beauty contest for the famed fourteenth [[Cavalcade of Jazz]] concert produced by [[Leon Hefflin, Sr.|Leon Hefflin Sr.]], held at the Shrine Auditorium on August 3. The other headliners were [[Little Willie John]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Ernie Freeman]], and [[Bo Rhambo]]. The event featured the top four prominent disc jockeys of Los Angeles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/dreamboogietrium00gura|title=Dream boogie : the triumph of Sam Cooke|last=Guralnick, Peter.|date=2005|publisher=Little, Brown|isbn=0316377945|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=57393650}}</ref><ref>"Sammy Davis Jr will crown…" Photo caption Mirror News July 31, 1958</ref>

In 1959, Davis became a member of the [[Rat Pack]], led by his friend [[Frank Sinatra]], which included fellow performers [[Dean Martin]], [[Joey Bishop]], and [[Peter Lawford]], a brother-in-law of [[John F. Kennedy]]. Initially, Sinatra called the gathering "the Clan", but Davis voiced his opposition, saying that it reminded people of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]. Sinatra renamed the group "the Summit". One long night of poker that went on into the early morning saw the men drunken and disheveled. As [[Angie Dickinson]] approached the group, she said, "You all look like a pack of rats." The nickname caught on, and they were then called the Rat Pack, the name of the earlier group led by [[Humphrey Bogart]] and his wife, [[Lauren Bacall]], who originally made the remark about the "pack of rats" they associated with.

The group around Sinatra made several movies together, including ''[[Ocean's 11]]'' (1960), ''[[Sergeants 3]]'' (1962), and ''[[Robin and the 7 Hoods]]'' (1964), and they performed onstage together in Las Vegas. In 1964, Davis was the first African American to sing at the Copacabana night club in New York.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.3366/cult.2015.0083| title=Sammy Davis, Jr: Public Image and Politics| year=2015| last1=Raymond| first1=Emilie| journal=Cultural History| volume=4| pages=42–63}}</ref>

Davis was a headliner at [[New Frontier Hotel and Casino|The Frontier Casino]] in Las Vegas, but owing to [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow practices]] in Las Vegas, he was required (as were all black performers in the 1950s) to lodge in a rooming house on the west side of the city instead of in the hotels as his white colleagues did. No dressing rooms were provided for black performers, and they had to wait outside by the swimming pool between acts. Davis and other black artists could entertain but could not stay at the hotels where they performed, gamble in the casinos, or dine or drink in the hotel restaurants and bars. Davis later refused to work at places that practiced [[racial segregation]].<ref>Sammy Davis Jr., Burt Boyar, and Jane Boyar, ''Sammy: The Autobiography of Sammy Davis Jr.'' (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2000).</ref>

Canada provided opportunities for performers like Davis unable to break the color barrier in U.S. broadcast television, and in 1959 he starred in his own TV special, ''Sammy's Parade'', on the Canadian network [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]].<ref>{{citation

In 1964, Davis was starring in ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]]'' at night and shooting his own New York-based afternoon talk show during the day. When he could get a day off from the theater, he recorded songs in the studio, performed at charity events in Chicago, Miami, or Las Vegas, or appeared on television variety specials in Los Angeles. Davis felt he was cheating his family of his company, but he said he was incapable of standing still.

Although he was still popular in Las Vegas, he saw his musical career decline by the late 1960s. He had a No.&nbsp;11 hit (No. 1 on the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening singles chart]]) with "[[I've Gotta Be Me]]" in 1969. He signed with Motown to update his sound and appeal to young people.<ref name="Chadbourne">{{cite web|last1=Chadbourne|first1=Eugene|title=Sammy Davis Jr. Now|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/sammy-davis-jr-now-mw0000893027|website=AllMusic|access-date=May 14, 2008}}</ref> His deal to have his own label with the company fell through. He had an unexpected No.&nbsp;1 hit with "[[The Candy Man]]" with [[MGM Records]] in 1972. He did not particularly care for the song and was chagrined that he had become known for it, but Davis made the most of his opportunity and revitalized his career.

Although he enjoyed no more Top 40 hits, he did enjoy popularity with his 1976 performance of the theme song from the ''[[Baretta]]'' television series, "Baretta's Theme (Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow)" (1975–1978), which was released as a single ([[Fox Music|20th Century]] [[20th Century Fox Records|Records]]). He appeared on the television shows ''[[The Rifleman]]'', ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'', ''[[All in the Family]]'' (during which he famously kisses [[Archie Bunker]] ([[Carroll O'Connor]]) on the cheek), and ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (with his wife, [[Altovise Davis]]). He appeared in Japanese commercials for [[Suntory]] whisky in the 1970s.

On December 11, 1967, NBC broadcast a musical-variety special featuring [[Nancy Sinatra]], the daughter of Frank Sinatra, titled ''[[Movin' with Nancy]]''. In addition to the Emmy Award-winning musical performances, the show is notable for Nancy Sinatra and Davis greeting each other with a kiss, one of the [[First interracial kiss on television|first black-white kisses in US television]].<ref>{{cite interview|last=Sinatra|first=Nancy|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0006/17/lklw.00.html|interviewer=Larry King|work=[[Larry King Live]]|publisher=CNN|date=June 17, 2000|title=Nancy Sinatra Reminisces}}</ref>

Davis had a friendship with [[Elvis Presley]] in the late 1960s, as they both were top-draw acts in Vegas at the same time. Davis was in many ways just as reclusive during his hotel gigs as Elvis was, holding parties mainly in his penthouse suite that Elvis occasionally attended. Davis sang a version of Presley's song "[[In the Ghetto]]" and made a cameo appearance in Presley's concert film ''[[Elvis: That's the Way It Is]]''. One year later, he made a cameo appearance in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'', but the scene was cut. In Japan, Davis appeared in television commercials for coffee, and in the United States he joined Sinatra and Martin in a radio commercial for a Chicago car dealership.

On May 27–28, 1973, Davis hosted (with [[Monty Hall]]) the first annual, 20-hour Highway Safety Foundation [[telethon]]. Guests included [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Paul Anka]], Jack Barry, Dr. [[Joyce Brothers]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Dick Clark]], [[Roy Clark]], [[Howard Cosell]], [[Ossie Davis]], [[Ruby Dee]], [[Joe Franklin]], [[Cliff Gorman]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Danny Kaye]],<ref name="NYDN">{{cite news| last = Davis | first = Sammy Jr.| title = Advertisement thanking the participants| newspaper = Daily News (New York)| location = New York| page = 55| date = June 22, 1973}}</ref> [[Jerry Lewis]], [[Hal Linden]], [[Rich Little]], [[Butterfly McQueen]], [[Minnie Pearl]], [[Boots Randolph]], [[Tex Ritter]], [[Phil Rizzuto]], [[The Rockettes]], [[Nipsey Russell]], [[Sally Struthers]], [[Mel Tillis]], [[Ben Vereen]], and [[Lawrence Welk]].

Davis was a huge fan of daytime television, particularly the soap operas produced by the American Broadcasting Company. He made a cameo appearance on ''[[General Hospital]]'' and had a recurring role as Chip Warren on ''[[One Life to Live]]'', for which he received a 1980 [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination. He was also a game show fan, appearing on ''[[Family Feud]]'' in 1979 and ''[[Tattletales]]'' with his wife Altovise in the 1970s.

=== Relationships and marriages ===
[[File:Mr & Mrs Sammy Davis Jnr 2 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Davis with his third wife, [[Altovise Gore]], in 1987]]
In 1957, Davis was involved with actress [[Kim Novak]], who was under contract with [[Columbia Pictures]]. Because Novak was white, [[Harry Cohn]], the president of Columbia, gave in to his worries that backlash against the relationship could hurt the studio. There are several accounts of what happened, but they agree that Davis was threatened by organized crime figures close to Cohn.<ref name="Smithsonian">{{cite news |last1=Lanzendorfer |first1=Joy |title=Hollywood Loved Sammy Davis Jr. Until He Dated a White Movie Star |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/hollywood-loved-sammy-davis-jr-until-he-dated-white-movie-star-180964395/ |access-date=6 October 2019 |work=Smithsonian |date=9 August 2017 |language=en}}</ref> According to one account, Cohn called racketeer [[John Roselli]], who was told to inform Davis that he must stop seeing Novak.

[[File:Sammy Davis, Jr. and May Britt, 1960.jpg|thumb|Davis and May Britt, 1960]]
In 1960, there was another racially charged public controversy when Davis married white, Swedish-born actress [[May Britt]] in a ceremony officiated by Rabbi [[William M. Kramer]] at Temple Israel of Hollywood. While interracial marriage had been legal in California since 1948, [[anti-miscegenation laws|anti-miscegenation laws in the U.S.]] still stood in 23 states, and a 1958 opinion poll had found that only four percent of Americans supported marriage between black and white spouses.<ref>Newport, Frank "[http://news.gallup.com/poll/163697/approve-marriage-blacks-whites.aspx In U.S., 87% Approve of Black-White Marriage, vs. 4% in 1958]", ''Gallup News'', July 25, 2013</ref> During 1964–66, Davis received racist hate mail while starring in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] adaptation of ''[[Golden Boy (musical)|Golden Boy]]'', in which his character is in a relationship with a white woman, paralleling his own interracial relationship. At the time Davis appeared in the musical, although New York had no laws against it, debate about interracial marriage was still ongoing in America as ''[[Loving v. Virginia]]'' was being fought. It was only in 1967, after the musical finished, that anti-miscegenation laws in all states were ruled [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].<ref>''Loving v. Virginia''.</ref>

They divorced in 1968 after Davis admitted to having had an affair with singer [[Lola Falana]].

In 1968, Davis started dating [[Altovise Davis|Altovise Gore]], a dancer in ''Golden Boy''. They were married on May 11, 1970, by Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and adopted a son, Manny, in 1989.<ref name=":6" /> Davis and Gore remained married until his death in 1990.<ref name="LATimes-1990-08-08" />

=== Hobbies ===
Davis was an avid photographer who enjoyed shooting pictures of family and acquaintances. His body of work was detailed in a 2007 book by Burt Boyar titled ''Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr.''<ref>{{cite book |last=Boyar |first=Burt |url=https://archive.org/details/photobysammydavi00davi/page/338 |title=Photo by Sammy Davis, Jr. |publisher=Regan Books |year=2007 |isbn=9780061146053 |location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/photobysammydavi00davi/page/338 338]}}</ref> "Jerry [Lewis] gave me my first important camera, my first 35 millimeter, during the Ciro's period, early '50s", Boyar quotes Davis as saying "And he hooked me". Davis used a [[Medium format (film)|medium format camera]] later on to capture images. Boyar reports that Davis had said, "Nobody interrupts a man taking a picture to ask... 'What's that nigger doin' here?'" His catalog includes rare photos of his father dancing onstage as part of the Will Mastin Trio and intimate snapshots of close friends Jerry Lewis, Dean Martin, Frank Sinatra, James Dean, Nat "King" Cole, and Marilyn Monroe. His political affiliations also were represented, in his images of Robert Kennedy, Jackie Kennedy, and Martin Luther King Jr. His most revealing work comes in photographs of wife May Britt and their three children, Tracey, Jeff and Mark.

Davis was an enthusiastic shooter and gun owner. He participated in fast-draw competitions. [[Johnny Cash]] recalled that Davis was said to be capable of drawing and firing a [[Colt Single Action Army]] revolver in less than a quarter of a second.<ref>{{cite news |last=Hurst |first=Jack |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-08-26/features/9408260197_1_american-recordings-fast-draw-sin-and-redemption |title=Johnny Cash's War Within |date=August 26, 1994|newspaper=Chicago Tribune |access-date=April 20, 2012}}</ref> Davis was skilled at fast and fancy [[gunspinning]] and appeared on television variety shows showing off this skill. He also demonstrated gunspinning to Mark on ''[[The Rifleman]]'' in "Two Ounces of Tin". He appeared in western films and as a guest star on several television westerns.

==Political beliefs==
[[File:Sammy Davis Jr.jpg|thumb|Davis during the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|1963 March on Washington]]]]
Davis was a registered [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and supported [[John F. Kennedy]]'s [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election campaign]] as well as [[Robert F.
