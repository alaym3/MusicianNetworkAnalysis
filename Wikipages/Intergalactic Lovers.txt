== History ==
Intergalactic Lovers was founded in the summer of 2008. A couple of its members already participated in the [[Humo's Rock Rally|Humos' Rock Rally 2008]] under the name "''Free Zamunda!''" without success.<ref>[http://www.humo.be/muziek/19794/humos-rock-rally-2008-de-preselecties-in-opwijk-en-antwerpen Humo's Rock Rally 2008: de preselecties in Opwijk en Antwerpen], ''[[HUMO]]'', 5 February 2008</ref> Afterwards, the band was restructured and the current name adopted.

In 2009 Intergalactic Lovers won the ''Oost-Vlaams Rockconcours'' and ''Rock Rally De Beloften''. Afterwards, their first successful single,  "''Fade Away''", reached the playlists of radio channels [[Studio Brussel]] and [[Radio 1 (Belgium)|Radio 1]]. Intergalactic Lovers then released "''Delay''", which was chosen as "Hotshot" by [[Studio Brussel]]. The song also made it to the number 1 spot in [[De Afrekening]].

On 25 March 2011 they released their first album entitled "''[[Greetings & Salutations (Intergalactic Lovers album)|Greetings & Salutations]]''", after releasing the title track of the album for download. The album was produced at the band's own expense and received a lot of positive coverage in ''[[HUMO]]''<ref>[http://www.humo.be/tws/cd-reviews/7050/intergalactic-lovers-greetings-salutations.html Intergalactic Lovers – Greetings & Salutations] ''[[HUMO]]'', 24 March 2011</ref> and ''[[De Standaard]]''.<ref>[http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=A837HHNT&word=intergalactic+Lovers 'Wij zijn echt niet cool'], ''[[De Standaard]]'', 19 March 2011</ref>

On 10 December 2011 the band received a MIA ([[Music Industry Awards|Music Industry Award]]) for 'Best Breakthrough Band'<ref>[http://www.gva.be/cnt/aid1098562/milow-en-selah-sue-winnen-meeste-mia-s 'Milow en Selah Sue winnen meeste MIA's'], ''[[Gazet Van Antwerpen]]'', 10 December 2011</ref>
