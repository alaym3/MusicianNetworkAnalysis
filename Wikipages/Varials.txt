==History==
The band members, all from Philadelphia or surrounding towns, had been a part of the 2009 music scene in one way or another, realizing this years later after they all met through different means.<ref name="bring">{{cite web|url=http://www.bringthenoise.com/blog/from-childhood-idols-to-metalcore-money-members|title=From Childhood Idols To Metalcore Money, Members of Varials Detail Their Start In Music / the NOISE|website=Bringthenoise.com|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref> By 2012, they officially formed Varials. The original lineup consisted of vocalist Jared Pilieri, guitarists James Hohenwarter and Shane Lyons, bassist Mike Foley, and drummer Sean Rauchut. Pilieri was kicked out of the band in 2014, with the band releasing a statement distancing themselves from him, stating "(Pilieri) used his place in this band to manipulate others and we all sincerely apologize to anyone that was affected by his actions"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/VarialsPA/posts/341020599437626|title=Varials|website=Facebook.com|access-date=30 May 2018}}</ref> He was replaced by Travis Tabron. Lyons left around 2017 and was replaced by former [[Capture (band)|Capture the Crown]] guitarist Mitchell Rogers.
