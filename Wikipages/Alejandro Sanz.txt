'''Alejandro Sánchez Pizarro''', better known as '''Alejandro Sanz''' ({{IPA-es|aleˈxandɾo ˈsanθ}};<ref>In isolation, ''Sanz'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|ˈsans|}} in Latin American Spanish.</ref> born December 18, 1968), is a Spanish musician, singer and composer. Sanz has won 22 [[Latin Grammy Awards]] and four [[Grammy Awards]]. He has received the Latin Grammy for [[Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] three times. The singer is notable for his [[flamenco]]-influenced ballads, and has also experimented with several other genres including [[pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], [[funk]], [[contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[jazz]].

Born in [[Madrid]] to parents from [[Andalusia]], Sanz began playing guitar at age seven, taking influence from his family's flamenco roots. Sanz released [[Los Chulos Son Pa' Cuidarlos|his debut album]] at age nineteen, although he did not gain commercial success in Spain until his second release, ''[[Viviendo Deprisa]]'' (1991). His next two records, ''[[Si Tú Me Miras]]'' (1993) and ''[[3 (Alejandro Sanz album)|3]]'' (1995) also fared well commercially, but it was his 1997 breakthrough album ''[[Más (album)|Más]]'' that garnered international success. ''[[El Alma al Aire]]'' followed in 2000, selling more than a million copies in its first week. In 2002, he became the first Spanish artist to record an ''[[MTV Unplugged (Alejandro Sanz album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' album.

His collaboration with [[Shakira]] on the 2005 single "[[La Tortura]]" reached number one on several charts worldwide. He experimented with more diverse styles of music with the albums ''[[No Es lo Mismo]]'' (2003)<ref name="Shakira" /> and ''[[El Tren de los Momentos]]'' (2006),<ref name="Allmusic" /><ref name="ParadiseC" /> while his 2009 release, ''[[Paraíso Express]]'' served as a return to form for the musician. Sanz signed to [[Universal Music Group]] in 2011 and released his tenth studio album, ''[[La Música No Se Toca]]'', in 2012, followed by ''[[Sirope]]'' in 2015.<ref name="TrenReview" />

==Early life==
Sanz was born in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], on December 18, 1968, the youngest son of María Pizarro and Jesús Sánchez.<ref name="Allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/artist/alejandro-sanz-p29408/biography|title=Alejandro Sanz – Biography|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|access-date=May 30, 2011|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410195455/http://allmusic.com/artist/alejandro-sanz-p29408/biography|archive-date=April 10, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He grew up in the neighborhood of [[Moratalaz]] in eastern Madrid.<ref name="Born">{{cite news|title=The place where Sanz's songs are born|work=El Pais|publisher=Prisacom|date=October 29, 2009}}</ref> Sanz recalled that "Back then, kids grew up on the street...I was a bit like the group [[troubadour]]; the one who played the guitar and sang.

He was exposed to traditional [[flamenco]] music as a child while vacationing each summer in his parents' native [[Andalusia]] in southern Spain.<ref name="NotContent"/> Originally, Sanz intended to become a flamenco performer, but he found the music teachers to be overly strict. Commenting on his early experiences, Sanz explained, "Flamenco can be very hard on beginners. If you lose the rhythm, they toss you out with, 'You're no good, boy!' They're very strict and very cruel. But it's also a marvelous education, because you either learn to play or else."<ref name="NotContent"/> He felt that he could not compete with his peers, and decided to focus on creating pop music with flamenco influences, viewing flamenco to be a "lifestyle" better suited to others.<ref name="Voice">{{cite news|title=Alejandro Sanz finds his voice|last=Harrington|first=Richard|date=April 23, 2004|work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

==Recording career==

===1989–96: First four albums===
As a teenager, Sanz performed in various venues in his hometown. He became acquainted with Miguel Ángel Arenas, a music industry executive who had signed several popular Spanish groups such as [[Mecano]].<ref name="Allmusic"/> Arenas helped Sanz find work, eventually leading to a record deal with the Spanish label [[Hispavox]].<ref name="Allmusic"/> In 1989 Sanz released his debut album, ''[[Los Chulos Son Pa' Cuidarlos]]'' under the name of Alejandro Magno (Spanish for "[[Alexander the Great]]").<ref name="Voice"/> The record, which fused [[Techno music|techno]] and flamenco, was met with critical and commercial indifference, and today Sanz views the record to be "insignificant".<ref name="NotContent"/> However, the album is now considered to be a collector's item.<ref name="Allmusic"/> In an attempt to promote ''Los Chulos Son Pa' Cuidarlos'', he performed at [[strip club]]s, playing short sets between acts.<ref name="NotContent"/> This proved to be unsuccessful and Sanz took a break from music, choosing to study [[business administration]].<ref name="NotContent"/> He also took a job at a recording studio in which he wrote material for other artists. He persuaded Arenas to send demos of his songs to record companies, which led to being signed by [[Warner Music Latina]].<ref name="NotContent"/> At this time, he began performing under his current name.<ref name="Allmusic"/>

Sanz's rise to fame began in 1991, when he released his first album from Warner, ''[[Viviendo Deprisa]]''. The record and the songs "Pisando Fuerte" and "Se le Apagó la Luz" helped him gain a dedicated fan base in Spain.<ref name="Soapbox">{{cite news|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-04-18/entertainment/0404141050_1_alejandro-sanz-latin-pop-warner-music|title=A Singer On A Soapbox|work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]]|last=Cózares|first=David|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|date=April 18, 2004|access-date=July 27, 2011|url-status=live|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110808195719/http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-04-18/entertainment/0404141050_1_alejandro-sanz-latin-pop-warner-music|archive-date=August 8, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In 1993, he released ''[[Si Tú Me Miras]]'' shortly followed by a live album, titled ''[[Básico]]''.

==Musical style==
Early in his career, Sanz' music generally consisted of romantic [[ballad]]s. However, in the late 1990s, his collaborations with other artists greatly expanded his musical style.<ref name="Allmusic"/> On ''No Es lo Mismo'', he experimented with rock, [[Salsa music|salsa]], and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]].<ref name="Voice"/> While recording the album, Sanz noted that he often entered the studio with a rough idea for a song and the guest artists would "contaminate it with their rhythms...in a good way."<ref name="HoustonChron"/> ''El Tren de los Momentos'' continued this pattern of musical experimentation, featuring diverse genres such as [[funk]], [[jazz]], and [[Country music|country]].<ref name="TrenReview">{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/el-tren-de-los-momentos-r930771/review|title=El Tren de los Momentos – Review|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|work=Allmusic|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=November 11, 2011}}</ref> Despite this, Jason Birchmeier of [[Allmusic]] described his musical evolution by saying "Even as Sanz broadened his style over the years, he never ventured far from his strength: romantic songs, generally ballads, tinged with flamenco and sung wholeheartedly with his distinct voice."<ref name="Allmusic"/>

Sanz is known for his distinctive raspy vocals, which he attributes to his flamenco roots, crediting singer [[Camarón de la Isla]] as a major influence.<ref name="PopSound">{{cite news|title= Alejandro Sanz shows attitude; Singer introduces flamenco-inspired pop sound to U.S.|agency=Associated Press|work=[[Telegraph Herald]]|publisher=Woodward Communications, Inc.|date=July 25, 2004}}</ref><ref name="Looking To Expand">{{cite news|url=http://www.newsday.com/columnists/other-columnists/sonidos-latinos-sanz-still-looking-to-expand-his-horizons-1.574305|title=SONIDOS LATINOS: Sanz still looking to expand his horizons|last=Morales|first=Ed|work=Newsday|publisher=[[Cablevision]]|date=January 19, 2008|access-date=January 25, 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729083113/http://www.newsday.com/columnists/other-columnists/sonidos-latinos-sanz-still-looking-to-expand-his-horizons-1.574305|archive-date=July 29, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His song "Sí, He Cantado Mal" (Yes, I Have Sung Badly) from ''No Es lo Mismo'' references this, with Sanz saying "I'm laughing a little at myself so that I can laugh at other things. Sometimes, I'm harder on myself than any music critic can be. I'm laughing at that."<ref name="PopSound"/> Throughout his youth, Sanz was heavily influenced by English-language [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] groups such as [[Iron Maiden]] and [[Dio (band)|Dio]], referring to himself as a "heavy metal radical".<ref name="PopSound"/> He also feels that living in the city of [[Cadiz]] had a major impact on his musical style, where "Any 7-year-old kid you find knows how to play guitar, play the [[cajón]], knows how to sing. When the family comes together we start to sing. In a way it's not just music, it's culture."<ref name="Looking To Expand"/>

Sanz married Mexican fashion model and actress [[Jaydy Michel]] in [[Bali]] on December 30, 1999, but this marriage was never legally recognized in either of their home countries.
