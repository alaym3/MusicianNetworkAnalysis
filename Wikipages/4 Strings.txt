'''4 Strings''' are a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[vocal trance]] group. The group was founded by [[Carlo Resoort]] and Jan De Vos.

Their biggest success came with the track "Take Me Away (Into the Night)", which peaked at number 15 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in May 2002.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/search/singles/take-me-away-into-the-night/|title=take me away into the night {{!}} full Official Chart History {{!}} Official Charts Company|language=en|access-date=2018-05-05}}</ref> In total, 4 Strings had five different [[Single (music)|singles]] in the UK chart between December 2000 and July 2004.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book|title=[[British Hit Singles & Albums]]|last=Roberts|first=David|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|year=2006|isbn=1-904994-10-5|edition=19th|location=London|page=210}}</ref>

Vanessa van Hemert was originally portrayed as the main vocalist of the group. However, it was revealed on April 5, 2019, that Susanne Teutenberg (aka Susann Gesang) was actually the vocalist behind most of the songs from the first two albums from 2002 to 2005. This was confirmed by Susanne herself on her Facebook page,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/susanne.teutenberg/posts/10214051374453642|title=Susanne's Facebook post}}</ref> and by 4 Strings on their Twitter page,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/4Stringsmusic/status/1114125759721934848|title=4 Strings' Twitter post}}</ref> with the other vocalists being Nikola Materne and Janson Lunar. It was then revealed that van Hemert only appeared lip-syncing in their live performances and videos between 2002 and 2005, never providing vocals on any of their tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Acij4UNP_c|title=The story behind "4 Strings - Take Me Away (Into The Night)" with Carlo Resoort - Muzikxpress|work=[[YouTube]]|access-date=May 15, 2020}}</ref>
