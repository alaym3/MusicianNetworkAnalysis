== History ==

In 2002, Queen Katherine School students [[Hayden Thorpe]] and Ben Little, then both sixteen years of age, formed the duo Fauve, the French term for "wild beast", and began writing songs together. In January 2004, classmates Chris Talbot and bassist Gareth Bullock joined as drummer and bassist respectively and the band's name became Wild Beasts.<ref name="Westmorland">Hargreaves, Ellie. 2006-11-17 [[Westmorland#Legacy|Westmorland Gazette]] "[http://www.thewestmorlandgazette.co.uk/search/display.var.1021838.0.wild_about_the_beasts.php Wild about the Beasts.]"</ref> At this time, the quartet had convened in a recording and rehearsal space dubbed Studio 6 in Kendal,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/cdsingle/cd/nc219511uk|title=CD Single: Wild Beasts - Mummy's Boy (2004)|via=www.45worlds.com}}</ref> where they recorded their eponymous demo [[Extended play|EP]] in June 2004. In September 2005, the band relocated to [[Leeds]] and Tom Fleming replaced Bullock as full-time bassist. All the bandmembers apart from Little studied at the local university, and played their first Leeds gig at Trash (formerly The Mixing Tin). The new quartet recorded two further demo EPs, ''Esprit De Corps'' and ''All Men''.

Wild Beasts signed a deal with Bad Sneakers Records in August 2006. They recorded a live session of three tracks in November 2006 for [[Marc Riley]]'s ''Brain Surgery'' on [[BBC Radio 6 Music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/6music/shows/brain_surgery/tracklisting_20061222.shtml |title=BBC Radio 6 Music - Marc Riley |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |access-date=2014-08-01}}</ref> Bad Sneakers released "Brave Bulging Buoyant Clairvoyants" on 20 November.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite web|author=Dave Simpson |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,1972106,00.html |title=First Sight: Wild Beasts &#124; Music &#124; The Guardian |publisher=Music.guardian.co.uk |access-date=2014-08-01}}</ref> With Hayden's "enormous falsetto voice, which soars over chiming guitars",<ref name="Guardian"/> the single was placed at number 17 in the UK indie chart.
