==Origin==
It was originally thought to be a corruption of the word "kamae tachi" (stance sword), but like the kyūki in the "Yin" part of [[Toriyama Sekien]]'s [[Gazu Hyakki Yagyō]], they were thus{{how?|date=October 2020}} re-used and depicted as a [[weasel]] yōkai, eventually becoming established as the yōkai it is now.{{CN|date=October 2020}} In the "Mimibukuro" by [[Negishi Shizumori]] as well, children in the estate called Kagaya in [[Edo]] were enveloped by a whirlwind, and on the surface of their backs, there remained the footsteps of a beast, and it was written that this was the proof of a "kamae tachi" ({{lang|ja|構太刀}}).<ref>{{Cite book|author={{lang|ja|千葉幹夫編}}|script-title=ja:全国妖怪事典|edition=|year=1995|publisher={{lang|ja|小学館}}|series={{lang|ja|小学館ライブラリー}}|isbn=978-4-09-460074-2|page=65|trans-title=National specter encyclopedia}}</ref> As a beast with fur like that of a [[hedgehog]], and a cry like that of a [[dog]], and one that flies through the air with wings, they are said to attack people with limbs like that of a [[sickle]] or [[razor]].<ref name="shokoku">{{Cite book|author=人文社編集部|script-title=ja:諸国怪談奇談集成 江戸諸国百物語 東日本編|year=2005|publisher=人文社|series=ものしりシリーズ|isbn=978-4-7959-1955-6|page=104}}</ref>

==Legends by area==
Devilish winds that would cut people are told about in the [[Chūbu region|Chūbu]], [[Kinki region|Kinki]], and other regions. There are many legends passed down in snowy regions and there are some regions that call whirlwinds themselves "kamaitachi". On occasions of cold wind and other times, they are also a strange event of where one would fall and get a leg injury.

In the Shin'etsu region, a kamaitachi is said to be the work of an evil god and there is a folk belief that one would encounter calamity by stepping on a calendar. It is counted among the [[seven mysteries of Echigo]].

There are also regions that think of these three gods as a parent, child and brother.

In the Yoshio District area of the [[Nara Prefecture]], it is said that when one gets bit by a kamaitachi invisible to the human eye, one would tumble over, even though no blood comes out, there is a big opening in the flesh.

In the eastern part of the [[Aichi Prefecture]], they are also called [[Kuda-gitsune|idzuna]] ({{lang|ja|飯綱}}) and it is said that since an izuna-user once forgot to tell his disciple about how to seal an izuna, the runaway izuna would ride on whirlwinds and attack people in order to suck their living blood.<ref>{{Cite book|author={{lang|ja|早川孝太郎}}|script-title=ja:日本民俗誌大系|year=1974|publisher={{lang|ja|角川書店}}|volume=第5巻|isbn=978-4-04-530305-0|page=91|script-chapter=ja:小県郡民譚集}}</ref> It is said that the reason why no blood comes from the wounds from a kamaitachi is because the blood is being sucked away.<ref name="gensousekai">{{Cite book|author={{lang|ja|多田克己}}|script-title=ja:幻想世界の住人たち IV 日本編|year=1990|publisher={{lang|ja|新紀元社}}|series=Truth in fantasy|isbn=978-4-915146-44-2|pages=212–213}}</ref>

==Writings in old literature==
In the [[Edo period]], in the essay "Sōzan Chomon Kishū ({{lang|ja|想山著聞奇集}})" by [[Miyoshi Shōzan]], a feudal warrior of Owari, it is said that the wounds from a kamaitachi does not result in pain or bleeding at first, but afterwards an intense pain and great amounts of bleeding results, so much that sometimes even the bones can be seen from the wound opening, and even a danger of death. Since these wounds are often received on the lower part of the body, it also states that a kamaitachi cannot jump higher than about 1 shaku (about 30 centimeters). Also according to Miyoshi Shōzan, as kamaitachi live in puddles after rain, it is said that there are those who played in puddles and those who cross rivers who encountered kamaitachi.<ref>{{Cite book|author={{lang|ja|三好想山}}|editor={{lang|ja|谷川健一他編}}|script-title=ja:日本庶民生活史料集成16|year=1970|publisher={{lang|ja|三一書房}}|volume={{lang|ja|第16巻}}|isbn=978-4-380-70504-5|pages=41–45|script-chapter=ja:想山著聞奇集}}</ref>

In the [[Hokuriku region]], according to the collection of fantastic stories, the [[Hokuetsu Kidan]], a kamaitachi is a wound resulting from touching the blade of a dreadful god.<ref name="youkaijiten"/>

According to the [[Kokon Hyaku Monogatari Hyōban]] from the Edo period, there is the statement "the people of the capital, or people of the name of a samurai, encounter this calamity and pass away ({{lang|ja|都がたの人または名字なる侍にはこの災ひなく候).}}"{{CN|date=March 2018}} If one encounters a kamaitachi, since there are medics who are familiar with this, they would rub some medicine on it healing it, so one would never die from it. In the northern parts of the country, it is cold in the shadows, weakening things. As it is cold in the northern parts of the country, cold wind blasts gather around, and the air is intensely cold. Borrowing this, they are said to be the deed of chimi in mountains and valleys. It is said that the reason why people don't receive this wound in the capital is because of the principle that malice does not win against true spirit.
