'''Great White''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band, formed in [[Los Angeles]] in 1977. The band peaked with several albums during the mid-to-late 1980s, including the platinum-selling records ''[[Once Bitten (Great White album)|Once Bitten]]'' (1987) and ''[[...Twice Shy]]'' (1989),<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Great%20White&ti=&lab=&genre=&format=&date_option=release&from=&to=&award=&type=&category=&adv=SEARCH#search_section|title=Gold & Platinum - RIAA|publisher=riaa.com|access-date=July 29, 2020}}</ref> and those albums' singles "[[Rock Me (Great White song)|Rock Me]]" and "[[Once Bitten, Twice Shy]]" received considerable airplay through radio and [[MTV]].<ref name="KNAC">{{Cite web|url=http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|title=KNAC A to Z Listing|date=March 5, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000305154225/http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|access-date=July 29, 2021|archive-date=2000-03-05}}</ref><ref name="Z-Rock">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklists.com/alltime52.html|title=Z-Rock Top 1001 Songs of All-Time (1990)|website=rocklists.com|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Headbangers Ball- The Unofficial Tribute Site - Episode Database|url=https://www.headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com/episode-database|work=headbangersballunofficialtributesite.com|access-date=July 29, 2021}}</ref> They charted two Top 40 hit singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], with "Once Bitten, Twice Shy" and "The Angel Song."<ref name="Hot 100">{{cite web| url = https://www.billboard.com/music/great-white/chart-history| title = Great White: Chart History{{snd}}Hot 100| website = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]| access-date = April 13, 2020}}</ref> They continued to release new material into the 1990s.

Great White broke up in 2001. Within the next few years, the band had performed as "[[Jack Russell (musician)|Jack Russell]]'s Great White",<ref name="jwgw"/> which had also made headlines when, in 2003, a [[Rhode Island]] nightclub at which they were playing [[The Station nightclub fire|caught fire]], leading to the deaths of 100 people, including band member [[Ty Longley]].<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web | url = https://www.allmusic.com/artist/p4401 | title = Great White Biography | access-date =4 April 2011 | last = Jeffries | first = David | work = [[AllMusic]] | publisher = [[Rovi Corporation]]}}</ref> By 2006, "Jack Russell's Great White" had reverted its name back to its original name Great White. After more than three decades as their singer, Russell left the band in 2011, again using the moniker "Jack Russell's Great White". Great White has since continued on without Russell, who was first replaced by Terry Ilous, and then by current singer [[Mitch Malloy]], who has been a member of the band since 2018.

As of August 2008, Great White estimated they had sold around eight million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auxportesdumetal.com/interviews/greatwhite-uk.html |title=Interview of Great White (Mark Kendall) for the "Back To The Rhythm" release |publisher=Auxportesdumetal.com |access-date=2013-10-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923180554/http://www.auxportesdumetal.com/interviews/greatwhite-uk.html |archive-date=2015-09-23 }}</ref>

==History==

===Early career and first two albums (1977–1986)===
Vocalist [[Jack Russell (musician)|Jack Russell]] met guitarist Mark Kendall in 1977, and Kendall asked Russell to join his band. They decided to form a band together and they called it Highway later changing it to Livewire and then played one final show as Wires. Then in 1979, Russell was arrested for shooting a live-in maid in a botched robbery attempt, and sentenced to 8 years in prison. The band went its separate ways and Kendall was left to start over. He recruited bassist Don Costa (later a one-time member of [[Ozzy Osbourne]] and also briefly in [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sleazeroxx.com/rik-fox-recalls-being-briefly-replaced-by-don-costa-in-w-a-s-p-before-blackie-lawless-took-over-on-bass/|title=Rik Fox recalls being briefly replaced by Don Costa in W.A.S.P. before Blackie Lawless took over on bass – Sleaze Roxx|last=Olivier|date=19 May 2019|language=en-CA|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref>) and drummer [[Tony Richards (musician)|Tony Richards]] (later a member of [[W.A.S.P. (band)|W.A.S.P.]]). They auditioned several singers including [[John Bush (musician)|John Bush]] from [[Armored Saint]], They then got a singer named Butch Say whose style was similar to that of [[Rob Halford]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myglobalmind.com/2014/06/27/interview-mark-kendall-guitar-great-white/|title=Interview with Mark Kendall (Guitar) (Great White)|date=2014-06-27|website=Your Online Magazine for Hard Rock and Heavy Metal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> but finally settling on a female singer Lisa Baker.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-strange-and-terrible-true-story-of-great-white|title=The Strange And Terrible True Story Of Great White|last=Hotten2016-09-10T17:00:00.253Z|first=Jon|website=Classic Rock Magazine|date=10 September 2016|language=en|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> The name they decided to go with was Dante Fox. They played their first gig in 1979 with singer Lisa Baker and played around [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] and the Los Angeles area for 6 months with Lisa, until she joined [[George Lynch (musician)|George Lynch]]'s band Xciter and Butch rejoined briefly.  Later they found out that Russell was released from prison after serving only 18 months of his sentence and Russell talked Kendall into an audition and he got in the band by a 2 to 1 band vote. They played their first gig with Russell at [[Troubadour (West Hollywood, California)|The Troubadour]] in [[Hollywood]], [[California]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}
[[File:Great-White-band-1986.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Great White as a quartet in 1986. From left: Lorne Black, Mark Kendall, Jack Russell, Audie Desbrow.]]
After recording several demos, the band chose as manager [[Alan Niven]], who had worked for the independent distributor Greenworld in [[Torrance, California]] and had dealt with [[Mötley Crüe]]'s debut self-release. Niven suggested the name change from Dante Fox after seeing Kendall stick his head out of a car window while driving by the Troubador and some kid in the crowd said "there goes Great White". Kendall got the nickname due to his naturally white-blonde hair, white [[Fender Telecaster]] guitar, white jumpsuit, and white [[Capezio]] shoes. In 1982, the members by this time (as Costa and Richards had left) were Mark Kendall, Jack Russell, drummer [[Gary Holland]], and bassist Lorne Black. They were soon in the studio and they recorded and released a 5-song [[Extended Play|EP]], ''[[Out of the Night]]'', on the independent label Aegean formed by Niven. Niven then convinced the Los Angeles radio station [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]] to begin adding songs from the EP to its playlist in heavy rotation. [[KLOS|KLOS-FM]] soon did the same. The band suddenly went from drawing 100 people to a local club to drawing thousands in L.A. concert halls such as Perkins Palace in [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], [[Avalon Hollywood|The Palace]] in Hollywood and the Country Club in [[Reseda, Los Angeles|Reseda]]. As an unsigned act, Great White headlined at [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] in [[Valencia, Santa Clarita, California|Valencia]] playing to 6,250 people. Near the end of 1983, [[EMI|EMI America]] signed the band and subsequently released Great White's [[Great White (album)|eponymous]] debut album in early 1984. The band immediately toured the UK supporting [[Whitesnake]]'s ''[[Slide It In]]'' tour and the entire US and Canada opening for [[Judas Priest]]'s ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]'' tour. They also supported [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] on their ''[[Lick It Up]]'' tour. ''[[Shot in the Dark (Great White album)|Shot in the Dark]]'', their follow-up independent release, marked the arrival of drummer Audie Desbrow after the firing of Holland on December 27, 1984.<ref>As per Jack Russell, former vocalist of Great White.</ref> By the time [[Capitol Records]] signed the band and reissued ''Shot in the Dark'', keyboardist-guitarist [[Michael Lardie]], who had played on that album as a session musician, had come aboard as a full member. After the release of ''Shot in the Dark'', Great White hit the road with [[Dokken]] for 5 shows and was on the verge of even bigger success.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Mainstream success (1987–1992)===
The band hit the mainstream in 1987 when they released their third album ''[[Once Bitten (Great White album)|Once Bitten]]'', accompanied by the hits "[[Rock Me (Great White song)|Rock Me]]", "[[Save Your Love (Great White song)|Save Your Love]]" and "Lady Red Light", all of which received significant airplay on [[album-oriented rock|mainstream rock radio stations]] such as [[KNAC]] and [[Z Rock]].<ref name="KNAC" /><ref name="Z-Rock" /><ref name="allmusic-bio" /> The model Tracy Martinson appeared on the cover of the album and also appeared in the video for "Save Your Love". ''Once Bitten...'' was [[platinum certification|certified platinum]] in April 1988,<ref name="RIAA" /> and a year-long tour in support of the album cemented Great White's popularity worldwide, performing with [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Twisted Sister]], [[Whitesnake]], [[David Lee Roth]] and [[TNT (Norwegian band)|TNT]], and appearing on several dates as part the European [[Monsters of Rock]] tour in the summer of 1988 with several acts such as [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Iron Maiden]], Guns N' Roses, David Lee Roth, [[Megadeth]], [[Helloween]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/great-white?page=9#concert-table |title=Great White's Concert & Tour History |website=concertarchives.org |accessdate=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnrontour.com/setlistalm88.htm |title=G n' R 1988 Setlist Almanac|website=gnrontour.com |accessdate=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vharchives.com/dlrtour1988 |title=G n' R 1988 Setlist Almanac |website=vharchives.com |accessdate=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.themonstersofrock.com/concerts |title=Concerts - Monsters of Rock |website=themonstersofrock.com |accessdate=July 29, 2021}}</ref>

The band followed up with ''[[...Twice Shy]]'' in 1989. By this point, Great White had parted ways with Lorne Black and replaced him with bassist Tony Montana (a.k.a. Tony Cardenas).<ref name="Blabbermouth"/> The album included their biggest hit, "[[Once Bitten, Twice Shy]]", a cover of a UK hit single by [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]; this is Great White's only single to date that has achieved gold certification.<ref name="RIAA" /> The model [[Bobbie Brown]] (also known for being in [[Warrant (American band)|Warrant]]'s "[[Cherry Pie (Warrant song)|Cherry Pie]]" video) appeared in the video for "Once Bitten, Twice Shy". Other songs from the album, including "The Angel Song", "[[House of Broken Love]]", "Mista Bone" and "Move It", received significant attention as well, through radio airplay or otherwise.<ref name="KNAC" /><ref name="Z-Rock" /> ''...Twice Shy'' was certified platinum in July 1989, then double platinum in September two months later,<ref name="RIAA" /> and received a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Hard Rock Performance. The album was supported by a successful world tour that saw Great White performing at arenas and stadiums, including sharing the stage with [[Bon Jovi]], [[Ratt]], [[Tesla (band)|Tesla]], [[Kix (band)|Kix]], Warrant, [[Badlands (American band)|Badlands]] and [[Britny Fox]], and supporting [[Alice Cooper]] on his ''[[Trash (Alice Cooper album)|Trash]]'' tour.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/great-white?page=7#concert-table |title=Great White's Concert & Tour History |website=concertarchives.org |accessdate=July 29, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.concertarchives.org/bands/great-white?page=8#concert-table |title=Great White's Concert & Tour History |website=concertarchives.org |accessdate=July 29, 2021}}</ref>

In 1990, the band featured in the heavy metal video series ''Hard 'N' Heavy'' containing music, concert footage and interviews. The video included [[Slash (musician)|Slash]] and [[Duff McKagan|Duff]] from [[Guns N' Roses]] appearing with the band at a Children of the Night Benefit concert in L.A., the performance helping to raise money for housing abused homeless children.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.snakepit.org/discvid.html | title = Slash Video Appearances | access-date = 4 April 2011 | date = October 2005 | publisher = Slash's Official Fan Site | quote = SLASH, Duff McKagan and Great White appear in footage from the Children of the Night Benefit in Los Angeles. | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727172439/http://www.snakepit.org/discvid.html | archive-date = 27 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-3WS6bYqg | title = great white w/ slash n duff – jam @ children of the night | access-date = 4 April 2011 | date = 27 March 2006 | publisher = [[YouTube]] | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140707192208/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-3WS6bYqg | archive-date = 7 July 2014 }}</ref> Both bands shared the same manager, Alan Niven, at the time.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

The band continued into the next decade performing the song "House of Broken Love" at the [[American Music Awards]] in January 1990. In March, Great White embarked on their first tour of [[Japan]]. They returned to the United States for the [[Memorial Day]] weekend festival dubbed [[The World Series of Rock]], which featured Whitesnake, [[Skid Row (American band)|Skid Row]], [[Bad English]], and Hericane Alice. Great White recorded two more albums for Capitol Records, ''[[Hooked (Great White album)|Hooked]]'', which was certified gold,<ref name="RIAA" /> and ''[[Psycho City]]''. In support of ''Hooked'', Great White did a tour as opener for the German metal band [[Scorpions (band)|Scorpions]] and traveled to [[Europe]] and [[Japan]]. During this tour Mark Kendall was hospitalized for a hiatal hernia for 3 weeks and then returned. Guitarist [[Al Pitrelli]] was asked to fill in for Mark during his absence. ''Psycho City'' was followed by a US tour with [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

===Years of commercial decline and disbandment (1993–2001)===
Capitol issued the [[compilation album|compilation]] ''[[The Best of Great White: 1986–1992]]'' in 1993, when Great White had already departed the label to begin work on their next studio release, ''[[Sail Away (Great White album)|Sail Away]]''. Before the release of the album, Great White spent seven months on the road headlining clubs. According to Lardie, it was "the longest stint we ever did without a break".{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Great White kept up the pace once ''Sail Away'' was released on [[Zoo Records]] in 1994, touring the US several times over the following year and a half. Their next release, ''[[Let It Rock (Great White album)|Let It Rock]]'', was released in 1996 through yet another label, [[Imago Records]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}<!-- [[Paula Cole]] article says Imago went out of business in 1994. -->

In 1999, the band released ''[[Can't Get There from Here (album)|Can't Get There from Here]]'' and embarked on a tour with [[Ratt]], [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], and [[L.A. Guns]]. The album featured the single "Rollin' Stoned", which managed to chart at No.&nbsp;8 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]] chart.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}

In a memo dated 20 January 2000 Mark Kendall announced he was taking a hiatus from Great White. Shortly thereafter both Audie Desbrow and [[Sean McNabb]] left Great White.  Russell continued to tour with guitarist Matthew Johnson. Desbrow, clearly very unhappy with the financial state of the band and Russell's addiction problems, posted a tirade on his website lambasting Jack Russell while claiming to have been "fired" from Great White.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-sludge.com/DesbrowRant.htm |title=Great White Drummer Gets Fired and Goes Off on the Band |access-date=4 April 2011 |last=Desbrow |first=Audie |date=20 September 2000 |publisher=Metal Sludge|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210023202/http://www.metal-sludge.com/DesbrowRant.htm |archive-date=10 February 2001 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Meanwhile, it was rumored that Sean McNabb was fired for going to management and asking to see the accounting books, but the truth was, he was policing Russell's drug use and Jack wasn't into it.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=216&Itemid=52 | title = 20 Questions with Ex-Great White Drummer Audie Desbrow | access-date = 4 April 2011 | date = 26 September 2000 | publisher =Metal Sludge | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110927222108/http://www.metalsludge.tv/home/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=216&Itemid=52 | archive-date = 27 September 2011 }}</ref> The band announced plans to begin work on a new album in late 2000.<ref name="auto">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8jAIbKVhRk|title=Great White Shark Attacks On Humans Caught|date=26 April 2014|publisher=[[YouTube]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017033431/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8jAIbKVhRk|archive-date=17 October 2015}}</ref> Early in the process, some of the new songs were played for [[John Kalodner]] at [[Columbia Records]]. It was mutually agreed that the band needed a break and wanted to do outside projects. Kendall went on to make two solo albums, and Russell also made a solo record. They subsequently left Columbia Records, curtailing any further work on the new album.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/jackrussell.html | title = Interview with Jack Russell | access-date = 4 April 2011 | last = McNeice | first = AJ | year = 2002 | publisher = MelodicRock.com | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110606114848/http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/jackrussell.html | archive-date = 6 June 2011 }}</ref> On 5 November 2001 Jack Russell announced the end of Great White,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://godsofrock.com/day-in-rock-history/November/5 | title = This Day in Rock History for November&nbsp;5 | access-date = 4 April 2011 | publisher = Gods Of Rock.com | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://archive.today/20120712020932/http://godsofrock.com/day-in-rock-history/November/5 | archive-date = 12 July 2012 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> stating that he was moving on, and that Great White would play one final farewell show on 31 December 2001 at the Galaxy Theatre in [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana, CA]].<ref name="auto"/> Both Kendall and McNabb rejoined the band for the farewell show, recorded for a live CD titled ''[[Thank You...Goodnight!]]'' released by Knight Records.

===Reunion, the Station nightclub fire incident and aftermath (2002–2009)===
By late 2002, his music now considered stylistically passe, Jack Russell contacted Kendall, who himself was struggling with irrelevancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1heavymetal.com/interviews/greatwhite.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011045829/http://www.1heavymetal.com/interviews/greatwhite.htm |archive-date=2008-10-11 |title=Great White 9/3/2003 Interview at www.1heavymetal.com |date=11 October 2008 |access-date=18 October 2011}}</ref> Kendall agreed to play some dates with Russell's band, allowing Russell to use the name Jack Russell's Great White once again.<ref name="jwgw">{{cite web | url = http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=7350 | title = Jack Russell To Bring Great White Back To Life On Upcoming Tour | access-date = 4 April 2011 | date = 2 November 2002 | work = [[Blabbermouth.net]] | publisher = [[Roadrunner Records]] | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708164250/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=7350 | archive-date = 8 July 2009 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Billed as "Jack Russell's Great White," the tour was to consist primarily of classic songs from the Great White catalog with some of Russell's solo work mixed in.

The band returned to the national spotlight on 20 February 2003. At the beginning of a Great White performance at [[The Station nightclub fire|The Station]] night club in [[Rhode Island]], [[pyrotechnics]] used by the band's crew created a spray of sparks that ignited the foam soundproofing material in the ceiling around the stage. One hundred people, including guitarist [[Ty Longley]], died in the fire that followed. Approximately 115 survivors were badly burned, maimed and permanently disfigured. In 2008, Jack Russell Touring INC., agreed to pay $1 million to survivors and victims' relatives of the fire while admitting to no wrongdoing.<ref name=settle>{{cite news|author=Tucker, Eric |title=Great White offers $1M to settle fatal fire suit |agency=Associated Press |date=2 September 2008 |url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5h5CMQKwNvVeIyOIxllb1n7aBsBnAD92US4S85 |access-date=3 September 2008 |quote=The band does not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which requires the approval of the more than 300 people suing, among other conditions.
