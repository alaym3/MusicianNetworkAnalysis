'''Deerhunter''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Atlanta, Georgia]], formed in 2001. The band currently consists of [[Bradford Cox]] (vocals, guitar, keyboards), [[Moses Archuleta]] (drums, electronics, sound treatments), [[Lotus Plaza|Lockett Pundt]] (guitar, vocals, keyboards), [[Josh McKay (musician)|Josh McKay]] (bass) and Javier Morales (keyboards, synthesizers, alto saxophone).

Founded by Cox and Archuleta, Deerhunter's first stable line-up included guitarist Colin Mee and bass guitarist Justin Bosworth. After recording a [[Deerhunter/Alphabets Split|split EP with Alphabets]], Bosworth died on March 29, 2004 of head injuries suffered during a skateboarding accident. He was 23 years old. The band recorded their first studio album, ''[[Turn It Up Faggot]]'' (2005), with [[Josh Fauver]] occupying the vacant role of bass guitarist. Following the album's release, Cox asked childhood friend, [[Lotus Plaza|Lockett Pundt]], to join Deerhunter as a song-writing partner, second guitarist, and occasional lead vocalist.

Recorded in two days, the band's follow-up, ''[[Cryptograms (album)|Cryptograms]]'' (2007), combined [[ambient music|ambient]] work and more angular garage rock songs. The release was quickly followed by the EP, ''[[Fluorescent Grey]]''. While touring the releases, Mee departed from Deerhunter, due to disagreements over the band's schedule, but rejoined soon after. Deerhunter released two studio albums, ''[[Microcastle]]'' and ''[[Weird Era Cont.]]'', in 2008. Both albums were recorded without the participation of Mee, who again departed for a second and final time. The band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement.

Recorded as a four-piece with producer Ben H. Allen, the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Halcyon Digest]]'' (2010), was released to widespread critical acclaim, ranked as [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork's]] 29th and [[Stereogum|Stereogum's]] 78th best album of the decade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-200-best-albums-of-the-2010s/|title=The 200 Best Albums of the 2010s|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/featured/best-albums-of-the-2010s-list/|title=The 100 Best Albums Of The 2010s|date=2019-11-04|website=Stereogum|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref> In 2012, the departure of long-time bassist Fauver placed the band's future in doubt. Cox, Pundt and Archuleta regrouped with new members, bassist Josh McKay and guitarist Frankie Broyles, to record the primitivist [[garage rock]] and [[musique concrète]]-influenced ''[[Monomania (Deerhunter album)|Monomania]]'' (2013). The album expanded on a darker and more disturbing sound, complete with treated tape recordings of rats and insects, exploring themes of disassociation and mental illness.

The following year, Cox was struck by a vehicle while walking his dog near his home in Atlanta's Grant Park. During his recovery and rehabilitation he focused on writing songs resulting in the album ''[[Fading Frontier]]'' (2015).

Deerhunter have described themselves as "[[Ambient music|ambient]] [[punk rock|punk]]," though they incorporate a wide range of genres, including [[noise rock|noise]], [[garage rock]],<ref name="stillinrock.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.stillinrock.com/2013/04/album-review-deerhunter-monomania.html|title=Brooklyn based Music Blog: Album Review : Deerhunter - Monomania (Nocturne Garage Rock)|publisher=Still in Rock|language=fr|access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref> [[art rock]], as well as significant [[Pop music|pop]] elements.

==History==

===2001–2005: Formation and ''Turn It Up Faggot''===
The band was co-founded in 2001 by vocalist [[Bradford Cox]] and drummer and keyboardist [[Moses Archuleta]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/archives/quit-your-day-job/quit-your-day-job-deerhunter.html|title=Quit Your Day Job: Deerhunter|last=Stosuy|first=Brandon|date=23 May 2007|website=Stereogum|access-date=20 June 2007}}</ref> The name Deerhunter (Which Cox has repeatedly remarked upon despising) was chosen by the band's first drummer, Dan Walton. Cox didn't care what the band was called as he thought it to be just another temporary art project. The band was joined by Colin Mee, whom Cox met while Mee was living at the Atlanta label [[Die Slaughterhaus Records]] with members of [[Black Lips]]. The two bonded over a shared interest in [[Dada]] and 20th Century Composers [[Olivier Messiaen|Oliver Messiaen]] and [[György Ligeti]], as well as British bands [[The Fall (band)|The Fall]], [[The Raincoats]], and [[Cabaret Voltaire (band)|Cabaret Voltaire]]. In 2004 the group's first bassist, Justin Bosworth, died of head injuries suffered in a [[skateboard]]ing accident. He appeared on only one Deerhunter release, the ''[[Deerhunter/Alphabets Split]]'', issued before their debut album. [[Josh Fauver|Joshua Fauver]], of Atlanta punk band Electrosleep International, then took up the position as bassist. Deerhunter's first album, ''[[Turn It Up Faggot]]'', was "the result of a lot of negativity".<ref name="CreativeLoafing1">{{cite web|url=http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A57335|title=Youth Gone Wild: Deerhunter's young punks try to fight off adulthood|last=Reeves|first=Mosi|date=21 December 2005|website=Creative Loafing|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930200820/http://atlanta.creativeloafing.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A57335|archive-date=30 September 2007|access-date=10 June 2007}}</ref> After the band finished the album, in an indication of how difficult it was to record in the wake of his bandmate's death, Cox said "I don't ever want to make this album again".<ref name=CreativeLoafing1/> The album's liner notes are dedicated to Bosworth. After the release of ''Turn It Up Faggot,'' Cox asked his best friend from high school, Lockett Pundt, to join the band.

===2005–2007: ''Cryptograms'' and ''Fluorescent Grey'' EP===
The band, now featuring Pundt's [[reverb]]-saturated guitar sound, went on tour, playing shows with the likes of [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]] and [[Gang Gang Dance]]. This tour culminated in a recording session engineered by acclaimed folk musician [[Samara Lubelski]] at Rare Book Room, [[New York City]].<ref name="PitchforkInterview3">{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/43085-interview-deerhunter|title=Interview: Deerhunter|last=Schreiber|first=Ryan|date=11 June 2007|website=Pitchfork|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114034303/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/feature/43085-interview-deerhunter|archive-date=14 January 2009|access-date=25 June 2007}}</ref> This session failed to produce anything that could be used, due to Cox's mental and physical state at the time, as well as technical disagreements that emerged with Lubelski.<ref name=PitchforkInterview3/> Cox has kept a copy of the sessions on "a scratched CD-R under my bed" and has stated that "nobody will ever hear them".<ref name=PitchforkInterview3/> In spite of Cox's claim excerpts from those sessions were later posted as a free download on the band's blog. The band returned to the same studio where they recorded their first album outside [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and decided to give recording their second album another attempt. This was partly due to advice received from the band [[Liars (band)|Liars]], who encouraged them to re-record it.<ref name=PitchforkInterview3/>

It took only two days in November 2005 for the band to record their second album, entitled ''[[Cryptograms (album)|Cryptograms]]''. In 2006, before its release, [[Pitchfork Media]] added "Spring Hall Convert", a song from the record, to its "Infinite Mix Tape series".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/39308-infinite-mixtape-51-deerhunter-spring-hall-convert|title=Infinite Mixtape No.&nbsp;51: Deerhunter: "Spring Hall Convert"|website=Pitchfork|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128010519/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/page/news/39308-infinite-mixtape-51-deerhunter-spring-hall-convert|archive-date=28 January 2008|access-date=10 July 2007}}</ref> The album was released by [[Kranky (record label)|Kranky]] in January 2007.

As with their first album, ''Cryptograms'' also had a dedication inside the album's liner notes, this time to a friend of Cox's, Bradley Ira Harris, a [[heroin]] addict who died in 2005.<ref name=PitchforkInterview3/>

On May 8, 2007, the group released the ''[[Fluorescent Grey]]'' EP, which was recorded in July 2006. The EP featured more use of rudimentary keyboards, bells, and pianos.

On August 29, 2007, the group became a quartet with the loss of guitarist Colin Mee. Mee departed because he "...couldn't make it to a couple of shows we had booked next weekend and that was unacceptable to certain bandmates".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/archives/colin-mee-leaves-deerhunter.html|title=Colin Mee Leaves Deerhunter|date=31 August 2007|website=Stereogum|access-date=1 September 2007}}</ref> Mee rejoined the band four months later, but departed the band for the final time before 2008.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-mtlg-iLEtAC&q=mee&pg=PA80|title=SPIN|date=April 2008|language=en}}</ref>

===2007–2009: ''Microcastle/Weird Era Cont.'', ''Rainwater Cassette Exchange'' EP, and hiatus===
Deerhunter contributed the song "After Class" to ''Living Bridge'', a compilation put together by Rare Book Room Records. The song was recorded in the same place where they attempted to record their second album. They returned to Rare Book Room studios in April 2008 to record [[Fluorescent Grey/Oh, It's Such A Shame|"Oh, It's Such A Shame,"]] a [[Jay Reatard]] cover that would be released as a split single with Reatard himself covering the ''[[Fluorescent Grey]]'' title track.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Jay-Reatard-Deerhunter-Split/release/1400559 |title=Jay Reatard / Deerhunter - Split (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> In the same month they recorded their next album, ''[[Microcastle]]''. Prior to the announced release date for the LP, the band continued to tour, with one date opening for [[The Smashing Pumpkins]] and a select of fall shows opening for [[Nine Inch Nails]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/30/AR2008103001564.html|title=Deerhunter "Microcastle" Kranky|last=Jenkins|first=Mark|date=31 October 2008|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=20 January 2016|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

The quartet's third offering, ''Microcastle'', was set to be released on October 27, 2008, although it became available through peer-to peer networks in late May. In an attempt to reward fans who awaited for the street date, the group reconvened to record a new album of material, ''[[Weird Era Cont.]]'', which later leaked before its street date also. However, ''Microcastle'' did manage to debut at No.&nbsp;123 on the Billboard 200,<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Artist Chart History - Deerhunter|access-date=6 November 2008|magazine=Billboard|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/deerhunter/chart-history}}</ref> a first for Deerhunter. Mee left the band again, for the final time, and the band enlisted former cheerleader and high school friend of Cox, Whitney Petty, as his touring replacement.

While touring the ''Microcastle'' album in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], Cox booked an evening in a studio and recorded what would become the ''On Platts Eyott'' cassette. This was released in two batches of 100 copies each; an edition of pink cassettes was given out to competition winners by his record label and orange cassettes were sold at a special [[Halloween]] concert in Atlanta on the 31st of October 2008. In a comment left on the Deerhunter blog on February 28, Cox announced that Whitney Petty was no longer a member of the band, stating:<ref>{{cite web|title=A|access-date=28 March 2009|work=Deerhunter Blog|url=http://deerhuntertheband.blogspot.com/2009/02/blog-post_11.html}}</ref>
{{cquote|We will be a four-piece again for now. Whitney is what you would call a 'free spirit.' She's also a great friend. Deerhunter is the four of us. We might have people come and go and that's just how we keep things interesting for ourselves.}}

While on tour, the band managed to release ''[[Rainwater Cassette Exchange]]'', an EP of songs written during the ''Microcastle'' sessions, and "[[Vox Celeste 5]]," a Sub Pop single of songs from ''Weird Era Cont.'' and ''Microcastle''. To promote the releases, they embarked on a short summer trek with [[No Age]] and [[Dan Deacon]] as the "No Deachunter Tour."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/35202-no-age-deerhunter-and-dan-deacon-to-tour-together-this-summer/|title=No Age, Deerhunter, and Dan Deacon to Tour Together This Summer|last=Phillips|first=Amy|date=28 April 2009|website=Pitchfork|access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> Later during a performance at [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] 2009 Music Festival in September (curated by [[The Flaming Lips]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/atpnewyork2009.php |title=ATP New York 2009 curated by The Flaming Lips & ATP - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> Bradford Cox announced that the band will be going on hiatus to "devote time to some other things," calling the show their last "for a long time."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2009/09/13/deerhunter-announce-hiatus-at-atp-festival/ |title=Deerhunter Announce Hiatus at ATP Festival |publisher=Spinner |date=13 September 2009 |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> During the hiatus, Bradford Cox continued with Atlas Sound and released his second album ''[[Logos (Atlas Sound album)|Logos]]'', Josh Fauver resumed work with his record label Army of Bad Luck, Moses Archuleta enrolled in culinary school, and Lockett Pundt performed some shows in celebration of ''[[The Floodlight Collective]]'', his debut album as Lotus Plaza released in March of that year.

===2010: ''Halcyon Digest''===
In early January, it was revealed that the group would serve as openers on the upcoming [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] tour to promote their album ''[[Transference (album)|Transference]]''. Along with the Spoon tour, the group also announced some shows of their own, including stops at the 2010 [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], and All Tomorrow's Parties (curated by [[Simpsons]] creator, [[Matt Groening]].)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/mattgroening.php |title=ATP curated by Matt Groening - All Tomorrow's Parties |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> During these shows, the band began to debut some new material, including the songs "Helicopter," "Primitive 3D," "Fountain Stairs" and "Revival,"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.setlist.fm/setlist/deerhunter/2010/coachella-festival-indio-ca-1bd4f194.html |title=Deerhunter Concert Setlist at Coachella Festival 2010 on April 18, 2010 |publisher=setlist.fm |access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> all of which would end up being recorded for their next studio session to follow.

In June, Deerhunter took a short break from touring to record ''[[Halcyon Digest]]''. Initial news of the album became public when music industry firm, Milk Money, posted a message on their [[Twitter]] account that the band had been mixing the new record with Ben Allen (who also worked on [[Animal Collective|Animal Collective's]] ''[[Merriweather Post Pavilion (album)|Merriweather Post Pavilion]]'' and ''[[Fall Be Kind|Fall Be Kind EP]]''.)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/39323-deerhunter-working-with-animal-collective-collaborator-ben-allen/|title=Deerhunter Working With Animal Collective Collaborator Ben Allen|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=30 June 2010|website=Pitchfork|access-date=2 April 2012}}</ref> A week later the band launched a new website, where they announced the title and release date of the LP, along with a [[Guerrilla marketing|guerilla]] style marketing campaign.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://halcyondigest.com/flyer/ |title=Deerhunter |publisher=Halcyon Digest |access-date=2 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309073009/http://halcyondigest.com/flyer/ |archive-date=9 March 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first single, "[[Revival (Deerhunter song)|Revival]]," was made available to fans who had assisted the band with promotion for the new album through a link via official email.

===2018-present: ''Double Dream of Spring'' and ''Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?''===
In 2018, the band released a cassette-only studio album during their Spring 2018 tour called ''Double Dream of Spring''. A mostly instrumental album, it was made to fill the void until their next album would be released the following year.

Deerhunter's eighth album ''[[Why Hasn't Everything Already Disappeared?]]'' was released on January 18, 2019.<ref name="p4kwhy">{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/deerhunter-announce-new-album-out-next-week-share-song-listen/|title=Deerhunter Announce New Album, Share Song: Listen|last1=Alston|first1=Trey|last2=Monroe|first2=Jazz|date=30 October 2018|website=Pitchfork|access-date=4 November 2018}}</ref> The album's first single, "Death in Midsummer", was released in October 2018 co-produced by [[Cate Le Bon]].<ref name="p4kwhy" />

On Halloween 2019, Deerhunter released the 13-minute long single "Timebends". A separate entity to their eighth studio album, ''Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?,'' "Timebends" is a partly-improvised stream-of-consciousness outpouring, recorded live direct to tape and in one take with minimal overdubs and mastered using a completely analogue signal chain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/deerhunter-new-song-timebends-906274/|title=Watch Deerhunter Record 13-Minute Song 'Timebends' in Studio Video|last=Kreps|first=Daniel|date=2019-10-31|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-11-14}}</ref>

==Musical style and influence==
The band has revealed many artists and genres that contribute to Deerhunter's sound. ''[[The New York Times]]'' concert review mentioned "[[the Breeders]], [[Stereolab]], [[disco]] rhythm, [[krautrock]], [[Sonic Youth]]’s noise breakdowns, [[Girl group|girl-group pop]], the picked eighth-note bass lines of 1980s indie rock", as influences.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/10/arts/music/10deer.html|title=A Stew of Rock and Pop Influences, Mixed Well and Served Slickly|last=Ratlif|first=Ben|date=9 December 2008|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=5 November 2011}}</ref> The song "Coronado" from ''Halcyon Digest'' features saxophone sounds inspired by [[the Rolling Stones]]' album ''[[Exile on Main St]]''. Cox recalled, "I wanted that sax on there because I was listening to the Stones' ''Exile on Main St'' reissue a lot...I began to see a pattern forming. Saxophones are becoming this thing. That's why we did it early. Next year everyone's gonna have a saxophone on their record because saxophones are just cool."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/articles/coverstory.aspx?csid1=148|title=Deerhunter|last=Lindsay|first=Cam|website=Exclaim!|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005082648/http://exclaim.ca/articles/coverstory.aspx?csid1=148|archive-date=5 October 2010|access-date=16 October 2015}}</ref>
