The first Tune-Yards album, ''[[Bird-Brains]]'' (stylized as ''BiRd-BrAiNs'') was originally self-released by Garbus on recycled cassette tape. It was recorded using only a handheld voice recorder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ink19.com/issues/may2009/interviews/tuneYards.html |title=Ink19 Tune-Yards: Master of Puppets |publisher=ink19.com |access-date=May 1, 2009}}</ref> A limited edition vinyl was released in June 2009, via the [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]-based imprint [[Marriage Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Tune-Yards-Bird-Brains/release/1779887 |title=Tune-Yards – Bird-Brains (LP) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> In July 2009, it was announced that Tune-Yards had signed to 4AD, and a limited edition pressing of ''Bird-Brains'' was released on August 17, 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Tune-Yards-Bird-Brains/release/1953417 |title=Tune-Yards – Bird-Brains (CD, Album, Lim) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=August 9, 2009 |access-date=February 2, 2010}}</ref> A full worldwide release followed on November 16, 2009 (and November 17 in North America). The autumn 2009 pressing was remastered at [[Abbey Road Studios]] by Christian Wright, and includes two new bonus tracks: "Want Me To" and "Real Live Flesh."

A second album, ''[[Whokill]]'' (stylized as ''w h o k i l l''), was released on April 19, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tune-yards.com/ |title=tUnE-yArDs official website|website=Tune-yards.com |access-date=April 17, 2011}}</ref>  A single from it, "Bizness", came out in February 2011. It was produced by Garbus and engineered by Eli Crews at New, Improved Studios in Oakland, California. Applying the live approach to Garbus' studio work for the first time, Garbus works with bass player Nate Brenner, who co-wrote some of the album's songs. Comparing the act to [[Sonic Youth]], Frontier Psychiatrist said, "if Bird-Brains was Garbus' ''[[Evol (Sonic Youth album)|Evol]]'', a record bursting with musical ideas that attempted to subvert the notion of song, ''who kill'' is Garbus' ''[[Sister (Sonic Youth album)|Sister]]'', a record that embraces the traditional pop song as a vehicle to convey those ideas."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frontpsych.com/2011/04/11/whats-a-girl-to-do-a-review-of-tune-yards-w-h-o-k-i-l-l/ |title=What's A Girl To Do?: A Review of tUnE-yArDs' w h o k i l l |publisher=Frontier Psychiatrist |date=April 11, 2011 |access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=On tUnE-YarDs, Chuck Klosterman and the End of the High Fidelity Era of Music Criticism|date=January 25, 2012|url=http://www.thelmagazine.com/TheMeasure/archives/2012/01/25/on-tune-yards-chuck-klosterman-and-the-end-of-the-high-fidelity-era-of-music-criticism|publisher=The L Magazine|access-date=17 June 2013}}</ref>  The album as well as singles "Bizness" and "Gangsta" received mention on many top 2011 album and song lists, including [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101344_2101364_2101588,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120107200915/http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101344_2101364_2101588,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 7, 2012 |title=Time Magazine Top 10 albums of 2011 (#6)|website=Time.com  | date=December 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2101344_2101365_2101669,00.html

The Tune-Yards scored the satiric sci fi film ''[[Sorry to Bother You (film)|Sorry to Bother You]]'' (2018).<ref name="Pitchfork Nov 2017"/> The film was shown at Sundance in January, then began a theatrical run in July. Its soundtrack songs are performed by [[the Coup]], fronted by the film's director, [[Boots Riley]]. Riley said he started working with Tune-Yards in "early 2015" to create the film's score, with demo tracks already available before the script was complete, and before the start of principal photography. Riley said he was attracted to Garbus's voice, and to the band's "unorthodox use of percussion and vocal layering."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/movies/8465339/sorry-to-bother-you-boots-riley-tune-yards-score-soundtrack|title='Sorry to Bother You' Director Boots Riley on Working With Tune-Yards and Breaking the Rules of Soundtracks|website=Billboard|access-date=December 17, 2018}}</ref>
