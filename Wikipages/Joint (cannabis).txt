A '''joint''' ({{IPAc-en|pron|dʒ|ɔɪ|n|t|}}), which is also commonly referred to as a '''spliff'''<ref name="etymonline.com" />(which can also mean specifically a joint that has tobacco mixed with cannabis), "'''doobie'''" or "'''doob'''".<ref>{{cite web |title=Doobie {{!}} Definition of Doobie by Merriam-Webster |url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/doobie |website=Merriam-Webster.com |access-date=7 November 2021}}</ref> is a rolled [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] [[cigarette]]. Unlike commercial [[tobacco]] cigarettes, the user ordinarily hand-rolls joints with [[rolling paper]]s, though in some cases they are machine-rolled.<ref>Rubin, Vera. ''Cannabis and Culture''. Walter de Gruyter, 1975. p. 509.</ref> Rolling papers are the most common rolling medium in [[industrialized countries]]; however, brown paper, cigarettes or [[beedi]]es with the tobacco removed, receipts and paper napkin can also be used, particularly in [[developing country|developing countries]].<ref>e.g., in Jamaica: ''The Rastafarians'' by Leonard E.

==Variations and terminology==

Although joints by definition contain cannabis,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/joint |title=Joint |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> regional differences exist. In Europe, in certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth nations]], and more recently in North America, joints, or spliffs,<ref name="etymonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=spliff |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> typically include a [[cigarette filter]] or a bit of rolled thin cardboard in one end to serve as a mouthpiece, commonly referred to as the ''crutch'', ''filter'', or ''[[roach (smoking)|roach]]''. 
The term "spliff" is sometimes used to distinguish a joint prepared with both cannabis and tobacco,<ref>[http://www.groups.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/National_Cannabis_Strategy_Consultation_Paper.pdf Australian Government Department of Health: National Cannabis Strategy Consultation Paper] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110227051735/http://www.groups.psychology.org.au/Assets/Files/National_Cannabis_Strategy_Consultation_Paper.pdf |date=27 February 2011 }}, page 4. "Cannabis has been described as a 'Trojan Horse' for nicotine addiction, given the usual method of mixing cannabis with tobacco when preparing marijuana for administration."</ref>
as is commonly done in European countries, where joints containing only cannabis are uncommon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jul/09/cannabis-users-who-put-tobacco-in-joints-more-likely-to-be-addicted|title=Cannabis users who put tobacco in joints 'more likely to be addicted'|work=The Guardian|author=Damien Gayle|date=9 July 2016|access-date=20 January 2018}}</ref> In the West Indies where this term originated (especially [[Jamaica]]), a ''spliff'' is simply a marijuana cigarette, normally containing no tobacco.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Special [[e-cigarette]]s, made to look like joints, have also been designed for use with cannabis extract.<ref>[https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/worlds-first-ejoint-given-its-debut-by-dutch-firm-says-its-selling-10000-a-day-9557607.html "World's first e-joint given its debut by Dutch firm, says it's selling 10,000 a day"], ''[[The Independent]]'' (retrieved 8 December 2014)</ref>

===Etymology and synonyms===
{{cleanup section|reason=formatting|date=March 2016}}
The word ''joint'' ultimately originated from French, where it is an adjective meaning 'joined' ([[past participle]] of the verb ''[[wikt:joindre#French|joindre]]''), derived in turn from Latin ''iunctus'', past participle of ''iungere'' ('join'/'bind'/'yoke'). By 1821, 'joint' had become an Anglo-Irish term for an annexe, or a side-room 'joined' to a main room. By 1877, this had developed into U.S. slang for a 'place, building, establishment,' and especially to an [[opium den]]. Its first usage in the sense of 'marijuana cigarette' is dated to 1938.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?l=j&p=3 |title=Online Etymological Dictionary |publisher=Etymonline.com |access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref>

Many [[slang]] terms are synonymous with the word ''joint''. 'Spliff' is a [[West Indies|West Indian]] word of [[Jamaican English]] origin which has spread to several western countries, particularly the UK and  Europe. Its precise etymology is unknown, but it is attested as early as 1936. 'J' or 'jay' can be used as an abbreviation for a generic joint. Another frequently used term is 'doobie.'<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/spliff |title=Spliff |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |access-date=20 April 2011}}</ref> The end or butt of a mostly smoked joint is referred to as a "[[roach (marijuana)|roach]]" in U.S. and [[Australian English|Australian]] slang.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/roach|title=Roach|website=Thefreedictionary.com|access-date=9 April 2018|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> Small metal clips to facilitate the smoking of a "roach" are called "roach clips".<ref>{{cite web|title=The Free Dictionary|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/roach+clip|website=Thefreedictionary.com|access-date=29 March 2016}}</ref> In the UK the term roach is commonly used to describe the cardboard mouthpiece. Roach clips cover a wide variety of paraphernalia including alligator clips, forceps, needle nose pliers, ceramic pieces with holes through them, and tweezers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lookah.com/blog/how-to-consume-marijuana-smoking-eating-and-drinking/|title=Roach Clip|website=lookah.com}}</ref>
