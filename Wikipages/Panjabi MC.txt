[[Nachural Records]] signed Panjabi MC following a [[remix]] of [[Kuldeep Manak]]'s "Ghariah Milan De". Although the single was taken off the market, Panjabi MC continued making records. Another successful release was "[[Mundian To Bach Ke]]" ("Beware of the Boys") (1998; it first appeared on the album ''Legalised'') which mixed the [[theme music|theme]] of the TV series ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'' with [[Bhangra (music)|Bhangra]]. An underground hit on the internet, it was picked up by the German record label Superstar Recordings, and became a [[hit record]] in Germany and across Europe, including the UK. A version of this recording in 2003 featured American rapper [[Jay-Z]] titled "[[Beware of the Boys]]".

His work, particularly the early singles and the "Mundian To Bach Ke" remix with [[Jay-Z]], brought [[bhangra (music)|bhangra]] to a global audience via the [[BBC]]. He continues to produce and remix music. In 2004, he made music called "Mirza" and mixed this song with [[Turkish people|Turkish]] singer [[Mustafa Sandal]]'s "[[Isyankar]]", but they did not release the mixed version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/nr6_britishasianmusic.pdf |title=Asian Allstars |access-date=28 December 2007 |last=Verma |first=Rahul |publisher=British Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817205455/http://www.britishcouncil.org/nr6_britishasianmusic.pdf |archive-date=17 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

The remix of "Mundian To Bach Ke" with Jay-Z appears on the soundtrack of the 2021 Netflix film ''[[The White Tiger (2021 film)|The White Tiger]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=January 27, 2021|title=The White Tiger - 2021 Netflix Movie Features Panjabi MC & JAY-Z|url=http://www.panjabi-mc.com/1/post/2021/01/the-white-tiger-2021-netflix-movie-features-panjabi-mc-jay-z.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-06-06|website=Panjabi MC|language=en}}</ref>

==Sampling==
On ''Indian Timing'', Panjabi MC uses vocal samples from [[Ofra Haza]] "[[Im Nin'Alu]]". He used "[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet 
Rock]]" ("Pyar Wich (Planet Rock Remix)" on the album ''Legalised'') before [[Afrika Bambaataa]] recorded "Indian Planet Rock". On "''Jatt Ho Giya Sharabee''", Panjabi MC uses the theme music from the TV show ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''  "Mundian To Bach Ke" (along with the subsequent remix version featuring [[Jay-Z]], "Beware of the Boys") uses the bassline from the television show ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.<ref name="VV"/>

==Television work==
In 2001, Panjabi MC made his Canadian premiere at the Payal Banquet Hall in Mississauga (Ontario). Deejay Ra hosted a TV special covering the event entitled "The Bhangramentary", which was aired on the Asian Television Network (ATN).  His single, "Jatt Ho Giya Sharabee", from ''Beware'', was featured on the television show ''[[Heroes (U.S. TV series)|Heroes]]'' (episode 2, ''[[Don't Look Back (Heroes)|Don't Look Back]]'', which aired 2 October 2006).  The single "Mundian To Bach Ke" was featured in an episode of ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' and in the 2002 movie ''[[Bend It Like Beckham]]''.

Together with [[Sukhwinder Singh]] and [[Sapna Awasthi]], Panjabi MC remixed the popular song "[[Chaiyya Chaiyya]]" from the [[Bollywood]] film, ''[[Dil Se..]]''.
