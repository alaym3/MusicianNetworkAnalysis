'''Heilung''' is an experimental [[folk music]] band made up of members from [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Germany]].<ref name="season-of-mist.com">{{cite web |url=http://season-of-mist.com/bands/heilung |title=Heilung (Amplified History / Neofolk) |website=Season of Mist |access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Their music is based on texts and [[runic inscriptions]] from [[Germanic peoples]] of the [[Nordic Bronze Age|Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age Scandinavia|Iron Age]], and [[Viking Age]]. Heilung describe their music as "amplified history from early medieval northern Europe". Their music is usually about [[List of Germanic deities|Norse deities]], [[Jötunn|jǫtnar]], and [[Valkyrie|valkyries]]. "{{lang|de|Heilung}}" is a [[German language|German]] noun meaning "healing" in English.<ref name="maximumvolumemusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.maximumvolumemusic.com/featured-band-heilung/

== History ==
Heilung was founded in 2014 by vocalist Kai Uwe Faust (a German [[tattoo artist]] who specializes in [[Old Norse]] [[tattoo]]s), Danish producer Christopher Juul and the Norwegian singer Maria Franz (of the trio Songleikr and the [[progressive rock]]/[[pop-rock]] band Euzen). In 2015, the band self-released their debut album, ''Ofnir''.<ref name="revolvermag" />

The band's first performances in 2017 were at [[Castlefest]] and at the [[Midgardsblot]] Metalfestival. The Castlefest performance was recorded and released with the title ''Lifa'' on [[YouTube]] and as a live album.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1BsKIP4uYM |author=Heilung |title=LIFA – Full Show |date=1 November 2017 |website=YouTube |access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> Their 2017 performance at Midgardsblot was listed as one of the ten best performances of 2017 by ''[[Metal Hammer]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-10-best-gigs-of-2017 |title=The 10 best gigs of 2017 |date=13 December 2017 |magazine=[[Metal Hammer]] |access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref> Later that year, the band signed a contract with the label [[Season of Mist]]. 

On 20 April 2018, the two previously self-released albums ''Ofnir'' and ''Lifa'' were reissued on vinyl and CD.<ref name="CMU">{{cite web |url=http://www.completemusicupdate.com/article/one-liners-justin-timberlake-albert-hammond-jr-queen-and-adam-lambert-more/ |title=One Liners: Justin Timberlake, Albert Hammond Jr, Queen and Adam Lambert, more |first=Andy |last=Malt |date=5 February 2018 |website=Complete Music Update |access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref><ref name="season-of-mist.com" />

The band will compose the soundtrack for ''[[Senua's Saga: Hellblade II]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://freegametips.com/the-heilung-group-will-make-the-soundtrack-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2/ |title=The Heilung group will make the soundtrack of Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 |first=Chris |last=Watson |date=December 16, 2019 |website=Free Game Tips}}</ref>

== Style ==
According to Faust, the name of the band "Heilung", healing in [[German language|German]], says something about the style of the band: "The listener is supposed to be left at ease and in a relaxed state after a magical musical journey that is at times turbulent".<ref name="maximumvolumemusic" /> The recordings of the band are not limited to music, but also contain [[Poetry|poems]].

The references to the early ages of European Civilization are also made by using texts from historical artefacts or historical poems. The languages used are varied, with [[German language|German]], [[English language|English]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old High German]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], [[Old English]], [[Proto-Norse language|Proto-Norse]], [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]], and Viking age [[Old Norse]] being used.

As instruments, items are used that may have been already available to humans in the Iron Age, such as drums, bones or spears.

According to an August 2018 interview, the instruments they use consist of:<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://newnoisemagazine.com/grand-fashion-heilung-iconic-sound/ |title=The Grand Fashion of Heilung & Their Iconic Sound |first=Marika |last=Zorzi |date=4 August 2018 |magazine=New Noise |access-date=2019-12-11}}</ref>
* drums, including one with horse skin painted with human blood, two drums with deerskin and a drum with goatskin
* bones, including a human forearm bone and deer bones
* a buffalo horn [[Rattle_(percussion_beater)|rattle]]
* a clay rattle with human ashes
* a Hindu ritual bell
* antiques from temples
* a reconstructed silver cup from the [[Viking Age|Viking age]]
* a [[ravanahatha]] (an ancient instrument used in [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]] and surrounding areas, orignating from [[Hela (people)|Hela]] People, then brought to [[North India]] by [[Hanuman]], then to India.<ref>{{Citation|title=Ravanahatha|date=2021-08-28|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ravanahatha&oldid=1041036684|work=Wikipedia|language=en|access-date=2021-11-11}}</ref>)
* other rattles, whistles and percussive instruments

Faust's throat singing recalls the Tibetan or Mongolian style. Juul uses a chirping whisper as vocals.

Elaborately designed costumes are worn by the band members on stage. These are partly based on the "spiritual traditions of the [[Eurasia|Eurasian]] [[circumpolar peoples]]", or are historically correct reproductions of [[Nordic Bronze Age]] clothing.
