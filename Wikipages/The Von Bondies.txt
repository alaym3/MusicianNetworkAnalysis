'''The Von Bondies''' are an [[United States|American]] [[alternative rock]] [[musical ensemble|band]].

The original line-up formed at the 1997 [[The Cramps|Cramps]]/[[Guitar Wolf]] show by [[Jason Stollsteimer]] and [[Marcie Bolen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/2002-12-12/music/von-bondies-boogie-children|title=How the band started|publisher=Laweekly.com|access-date=2014-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grunnenrocks.nl/bands/v/vonbondies.htm|title=The Von Bondies | access-date=2020-07-26 |publisher=Grunnen Rocks}}</ref> They went through a variety of member changes and band names, including The Baby Killers, before settling on The Von Bondies in 2000. Don Blum joined the band around 1999 after attending numerous Baby Killers shows, while Leann Banks was picked via an audition. The Von Bondies got their break by playing a New Year's Eve show in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], in 2000. In attendance at the show was [[Long Gone John]], owner of the [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]] label. This led to Sympathy releasing the band's debut album ''[[Lack of Communication]]'' in 2001.

In 2003, the band released the live ''Raw and Rare'' through [[Dim Mak Records]], which was followed by their 2004 breakthrough release, ''[[Pawn Shoppe Heart]]'', on [[Sire Records]]. ''Pawn Shoppe'' was produced by [[Jerry Harrison]] of [[Talking Heads]] and co-produced by Stollsteimer.

The album reached a peak of No. 36 in the [[UK Albums Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

A shortened version of "C'mon C'mon" was the theme song to the TV series ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'' and was performed live by the band in [[Michael Winterbottom]]'s film ''[[9 Songs]]''. [[MLB Network]] also used a brief clip of the song as the opening of their show ''30 Clubs in 30 Days'' from 2009 to 2012.

In 2008, the band signed with indie label Majordomo Records,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://majordomorecords.com/ |title=Majordomo Records |publisher=Majordomo Records |date=2009-02-03 |access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref> joining label mates [[The Airborne Toxic Event]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Un |url=https://myspace.com/theairbornetoxicevent |title=The Airborne Toxic Event &#124; Gratis muziek, tourneedata, foto's, video's |publisher=Myspace.com |access-date=2012-04-29}}</ref> and [[Earlimart (band)|Earlimart]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://earlimartmusic.com/ |title=Earlimart |publisher=Earlimartmusic.com |access-date=2012-04-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427060941/http://earlimartmusic.com/ |archive-date=2012-04-27 }}</ref> Their label debut, ''[[Love, Hate and Then There's You]]'', was released in February 2009 featuring the single "Pale Bride".

They reformed in 2020 and planned a reunion tour, but those plans had to be abandoned due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Biography==

===Early days===
In 2000, Stollsteimer and  [[Marcie Bolen]] attended a concert by Japanese [[Garage punk (fusion genre)|garage punk]] band [[Guitar Wolf]]. At the time, Stollsteimer was working a job as a bowling alley bartender and Marcie as a hairdresser. The performance spurred Stollsteimer to create his own band, The Baby Killers, which toured with fellow Detroit bands [[The Detroit Cobras]], [[The Go]] and [[The White Stripes]]. After recruiting [[Lauren Wilcox]] on bass<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/von_bondies_jason_stollsteimer | title=The Von Bondies' Jason Stollsteimer | access-date=2020-07-26 |publisher=Exclaim}}</ref> and [[Don Blum]] on drums the band changed their name to the Von Bondies.

While playing a handful of shows in the [[Detroit]] area, the quartet recorded singles "It Came from Japan", an ode to Guitar Wolf, and "Nite Train".

===''Lack of Communication'' (2001–2002)===
