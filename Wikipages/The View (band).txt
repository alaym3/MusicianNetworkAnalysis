During the tour, the View played with the Underground Heroes at the Tap'n'Tin in Chatham. At the end of the night, the View and Underground Heroes joined forces on a version of "Same Jeans". The union prompted the band to be called 'The Underground View'. In 2007, the band performed shows in Australia and performed "Same Jeans" on the [[talk show]] ''[[Rove Live]]''. Instead of waiting on-stage to shake hands with the host, the band immediately left the stage, leaving [[Rove McManus]] with a simple pat on the back from Steven Morrison.

Taken from the album, their first single, "Wasted Little DJs", was released 7 August 2006. The single is dedicated to a pair of blonde hairdressers from Dundee who go by the name "wasted little DJs". The girls set the trend for hairstyles in Dundee, and many of the band's female fans sport the same unique hairstyle.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The first single entered the UK top 75 at No.&nbsp;73 on the week before full release, due to download sales alone, and climbed to No.&nbsp;15 the following week.
