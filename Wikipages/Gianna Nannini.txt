==Early life==
Nannini was born in [[Siena]] on 14 June 1954.<ref name="whoiswho"/><ref name="left34"/><ref name="stampa2010"/><ref name="incHitaly"/><ref name="lodiceleistessa"/><ref name="certNascita"/> She is the elder sister of former [[Formula One]] racing driver [[Alessandro Nannini]]. She studied piano and composition in Milan in the late 1970s and obtained a degree in Philosophy from the [[University of Siena]] in 1994. The following year she took part in a protest organized by [[Greenpeace]] at the French embassy in [[Rome]] against the decision of the French government to pursue nuclear experiments at [[Mururoa]].

==Musical career==
[[File:2017 Gianna Nannini - by 2eight - DSC3677.jpg|thumb|Nannini performing in 2017]]
Nannini scored her first domestic hit in 1979 with the single "America" and the album ''[[California (Gianna Nannini album)|California]]'', which became a success in several European countries. Her international breakthrough happened in 1984 with the release of her sixth album, the [[Conny Plank]]-produced ''[[Puzzle (Gianna Nannini album)|Puzzle]]'', which peaked in the top 10 in the Italian, German, Austrian and Swiss charts. The first single from the album, "[[Fotoromanza]]", was supported by a music video directed by [[Michelangelo Antonioni]], and went on to win many musical awards. Nannini embarked on a long European tour to support the album, culminating in a headlining gig at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]].

In 1986, her song "[[Bello e impossibile]]" was a European hit in Italy, Germany, [[Austria]] and [[Switzerland]]. Her 1987 compilation album ''[[Maschi e Altri]]'' sold over a million copies.

In 2004, she released the greatest hits album ''[[Perle (album)|Perle]]'', where a number of her most renowned songs were rearrangemed with the support of musicians such as Christian Lohr on piano (who also had a co-producer credit), and a string quartet composed of Vincenzo di Donna (first violin), Luigi de Maio (second violin), Gerardo Morrone (viola) and Antonio di Franca (violoncello). With this orchestra Nannini went on a European tour from 2004 to 2005.

The album ''[[Grazie]]'' was released in February 2006, and peaked at number one of the Italian hit-parade with the single "Sei nell'anima".

In April 2007, Nannini released ''Pia come la canto io'', a collection of songs produced by Wil Malone and originally intended for a rock opera based on the medieval Tuscan character [[Pia de' Tolomei]] (briefly mentioned in [[Purgatorio|Dante's Purgatorio]]) that would eventually be performed in 2008 after eleven years of gestation.

An acoustic version of her song ''[[Meravigliosa Creatura]]'' (from ''Perle'') has been used in a 2008 advertisement commercial for the [[Fiat Bravo (2007)|Fiat Bravo]] directed by Matthias Zentner. [[Fiat]] would later include another Gianna Nannini song, "Aria", in a subsequent Fiat Bravo ad.

===Duets===
In 1987 she performed with [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and [[Jack Bruce]] the "Three Penny Opera" by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]] at the Schauspielhaus in Hamburg. In 1990, she and [[Edoardo Bennato]] sang "[[Un'estate italiana]]", the official song of the [[Football World Cup 1990]] composed by [[Giorgio Moroder]]. In September 2006, she recorded the single "[[Ama Credi E Vai]]" with [[Andrea Bocelli]]. Nannini was also featured on [[Einstürzende Neubauten]] member [[Alexander Hacke]]'s solo album ''Sanctuary'', on the track "Per Sempre Butterfly". In 2008 she duetted with the Italian rapper [[Fabri Fibra]] in his videoclip version of the song "In Italia". She also sang the song "Aria" with the [[Macedonia (country)|Macedonian]] vocalist [[Toše Proeski]].

On 26 November 2010, at 12&nbsp;am, Nannini's daughter Penelope Jane Charlotte was born at the Madonnina Clinic in Milan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sorrisi.com/live-news/e-nata-penelope-la-figlia-di-gianna-nannini/ |title=È nata Penelope, la figlia di Gianna Nannini |access-date=23 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160704055328/http://www.sorrisi.com/live-news/e-nata-penelope-la-figlia-di-gianna-nannini |archive-date=4 July 2016 |url-status=dead |lang=it}}</ref> In 2017, Nannini decided to move to London with her partner, Carla.
