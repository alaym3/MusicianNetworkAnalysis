'''Big Red Machine''' is an American [[indie folk]] band that began as a collaboration between musicians [[Aaron Dessner]] and [[Justin Vernon]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Atkinson|first=Katie|date=July 2, 2021|title=Big Red Machine & Taylor Swift's 'Renegade' Has Arrived: Stream It Now|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/9596120/big-red-machine-taylor-swift-renegade-stream-aaron-dessner-justin-vernon|url-status=live|access-date=July 2, 2021|website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]}}</ref> The band is named after the nickname for the dominant 1970s [[Cincinnati Reds]] baseball teams, which won the [[1976 World Series]] in Dessner's birth year.<ref name=":2" />

==History==
===2008–2016: Formation and beginnings===
Big Red Machine began as a musical collaboration in 2008, when [[Aaron Dessner]] messaged [[Justin Vernon]] on [[MySpace]], without any prior personal meeting. Dessner sent Vernon an instrumental idea for a compilation album named ''[[Dark Was the Night (album)|Dark Was the Night]]'', benefiting the [[Red Hot Organization]], which he wanted Vernon to write a song for.<ref name="auto">{{cite web |last1=Dessner |first1=Aaron |title=Eaux Claires Opens Up |url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/justin-vernon-x-aaron-dessner-eaux-claires-music-festival |website=Interview Magazine |publisher=Interview Magazine |accessdate=16 October 2018 |date=10 February 2015}}</ref> The sketch was titled "Big Red Machine", and Vernon created a completed song using the track. The album was celebrated with a show at [[Radio City Music Hall]], where the two met and began further collaborating. Since then, they have worked on a number of projects together, including PEOPLE Collective, Eaux Claires Music & Arts Festival, and ''[[Day of the Dead (2016 album)|Day of the Dead]]''.<ref name="auto"/>

Dessner is most famous for being a founding member, songwriter, and producer for [[The National (band)|The National]], and Vernon for being the leader of [[Bon Iver]].

In 2016, Vernon, Dessner, and Dessner's twin brother [[Bryce Dessner]] founded an artist collective named PEOPLE. The PEOPLE website states that the concept aims to "establish an independent and nurturing space in which to make work (generally around music) that is collaborative, spontaneous and expressive in nature and where all unnecessary distractions or obstacles that get in the way are removed."<ref>{{cite web |last1=PEOPLE |title=37d03d |url=https://www.37d03d.com |website=PEOPLE |publisher=PEOPLE |accessdate=15 October 2018}}</ref> They first gathered for a festival at Funkhaus, [[Berlin]], in 2016. The second festival took place in 2018, again at Funkhaus. Since 2016, Big Red Machine has played festival sets at [[Eaux Claires]], Haven, and Sounds From a Safe Harbour.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2018/07/big-red-machine-debut-album/|title=Aaron Dessner and Justin Vernon’s Big Red Machine announce debut LP, share four songs: Stream|last1=Kaye|first1=Ben|date=13 July 2018|website=Consequence of Sound|publisher=Consequence of Sound|accessdate=31 October 2018}}</ref>

Dessner has stated that the original sketch that he sent to Vernon in 2008, named "Big Red Machine", uses the nickname of the 1970s [[Cincinnati Reds]] teams that won the [[World Series]] back to back in 1975 and 1976. The team received the nickname "[[The Big Red Machine]]" throughout this successful period. Aaron Dessner grew up in [[Cincinnati]], and he and his twin brother were born in 1976, during the Reds' run.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/justin-vernon-x-aaron-dessner-eaux-claires-music-festival|title=Eaux Claires Opens Up|last1=Dessner|first1=Aaron|date=10 February 2015|website=Interview Magazine|publisher=Interview Magazine|accessdate=16 October 2018}}</ref>
