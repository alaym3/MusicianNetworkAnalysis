==Biography==

[[File:Daguerreotype of Eliza Tomlinson Foster and William Barclay Foster, restored and enhanced with digital tools.jpg |thumb|175px|left|Eliza Tomlinson Foster and William Barclay Foster]]

There are many biographies of Foster, but details differ widely. Among other issues, Foster wrote very little biographical information himself, and his brother [[Morrison Foster]] destroyed much information that he judged to reflect negatively upon the family.<ref name="Howard1944">{{cite journal |last1= Howard |first1= John Tasker |title= The Literature on Stephen Foster |journal= Notes: Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association |volume=1 |issue=2 |date=March 1944 |pages= 10–15 |issn= 0027-4380 |doi= 10.2307/891301 |jstor= 891301 }}</ref><ref name="root-1990">{{cite web |last1=Root |first1=Deane L. |title=The "Mythtory" of Stephen C.

Foster was born on July 4, 1826,<ref name=SAND/> to [[William Barclay Foster]] and [[Eliza Clayland Tomlinson Foster]], with three older sisters and six older brothers. His parents were of [[Ulster Scots people|Ulster Scots]] and [[English people|English]] descent. He attended private academies in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]], [[Athens, Pennsylvania|Athens]], and [[Towanda, Pennsylvania]], and received an education in English grammar, diction, the classics, penmanship, Latin, Greek, and mathematics. The family lived in a northern city but they did not support the abolition of slavery.<ref name=SAND>{{cite journal |last1=Sanders |first1=Paul |title= Comrades, Fill No Glass For Me: Stephen Foster's Medlodies As Borrowed by the American Temperance Movement |journal= Social History of Alcohol and Drugs |date=Fall 2008 |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=24–40 |url= https://alcoholanddrugshistorysociety.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/shad-23-1-sanders1.pdf |access-date= October 13, 2015|doi=10.1086/SHAD23010024 |s2cid=165454878 }}</ref>

Foster taught himself to play the clarinet, guitar, flute, and piano. He did not have formal instruction in composition but he was helped by Henry Kleber (1816–1897), a German-born music dealer in Pittsburgh.<ref name=CFAM/> In 1839, his brother William was serving his apprenticeship as an engineer at Towanda and thought that Stephen would benefit from being under his supervision. The site of the [[Camptown Races]] is {{convert|30|mi}} from Athens and 15 miles from Towanda. His education included a brief period at Jefferson College in [[Canonsburg, Pennsylvania]], now part of [[Washington & Jefferson College]].<ref name=doodah />{{#tag:ref | His grandfather James Foster was an associate of [[John McMillan (pastor)|John McMillan]] and a founding trustee of Canonsburg Academy, a predecessor institution to Jefferson College; his father William Barclay Foster attended Canonsburg Academy until age 16.<ref name=milligan>{{Cite book |last= Vincent Milligan |first= Harold |title= Stephen Collins Foster: a biography of America's folk-song composer |publisher= G.

==Career==

In 1846, Foster moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], and became a bookkeeper with his brother Dunning's steamship company. He wrote his first successful songs in 1848–1849, among them "[[Oh! Susanna]]",<ref name="CAMbio">{{cite web |title=Biography |url=https://www.pitt.edu/~amerimus/Fosterbiography.html |website=The Center for American Music |publisher=Univ. of Pittsburgh |access-date=25 September 2018}}</ref> which became an anthem of the [[California Gold Rush]]. In 1849, he published ''Foster's Ethiopian Melodies'', which included the successful song "Nelly Was a Lady" as made famous by the [[Christy Minstrels]]. A plaque marks the site of his residence in Cincinnati, where the [[Guilford School building]] is now located.

[[File:STEPHEN COLLINS FOSTER HOME IN HOBOKEN NEW JERSEY.jpg |thumb|upright=1.3| House in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]] where Foster is believed to have written "[[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair]]" in 1854<ref name="nythobo">{{cite news |last1= Sisario |first1=Ben |title= ON THE MAP; Stephen Foster's Old Hoboken Home |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/20/nyregion/on-the-map-stephen-foster-s-old-hoboken-home.html |access-date= July 4, 2016 |work= The New York Times |date= September 20, 1998}}</ref>]]
Then he returned to Pennsylvania and signed a contract with the Christy Minstrels. It was during this period that he wrote most of his best-known songs: "[[Camptown Races]]" (1850), "Nelly Bly" (1850), "[[Ring de Banjo]]" (1851), "[[Old Folks at Home]]" (known also as "Swanee River", 1851), "[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" (1853), "Old Dog Tray" (1853), and "[[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair]]" (1854), written for his wife Jane Denny McDowell.
[[File:Illustration of SC Foster headstone in Alleghney cemetery 1900 monumen posibly.jpg|thumb|175px|right|A ''Pittsburgh Press'' illustration of the original headstone on Stephen Foster's grave]]
Many of Foster's songs were of the [[blackface]] [[minstrel show]] tradition popular at the time but are now considered to be offensive for their racist themes. He sought to "build up taste...among refined people by making words suitable to their taste, instead of the trashy and really offensive words which belong to some songs of that order".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.shoppbs.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/peopleevents/p_sfoster.html|title=American Experience &#124; Stephen Foster &#124; People & Events|website=Shoppbs.pbs.org|access-date=January 8, 2021}}</ref> In the 1850s, he associated with a Pittsburgh-area [[abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] leader named Charles Shiras, and wrote an abolitionist play himself.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 10.5406/americanmusic.30.3.0275|doi = 10.5406/americanmusic.30.3.0275|title = The Social Agenda of Stephen Foster's Plantation Melodies|year = 2012|last1 = Saunders|journal = American Music|volume = 30|issue = 3|pages = 275–289|s2cid = 144617319}}</ref> Many of his songs had Southern themes, yet Foster never lived in the South and visited it only once, during his 1852 honeymoon.

Foster's last four years were spent in New York City. There is little information on this period of his life, although family correspondence has been preserved.<ref name="Root"/>

==Illness and death==

Foster became sick with a fever in January 1864. Weakened, he fell in his hotel in the Bowery, cutting his neck. His writing partner [[George Cooper (poet)|George Cooper]] found him still alive but lying in a pool of blood. Foster died in Bellevue Hospital three days later at the age of 37.<ref>{{cite web |work= American Experience |title= More about the film ''Stephen Foster'' |url= https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/foster/filmmore/pt.html |publisher=PBS |access-date=October 2, 2015}}</ref> Other biographers describe different accounts of his death.<ref name="ocon2007">{{cite thesis|last=O'Connell|first=JoAnne H.|date=2007|title=Understanding Stephen Collins Foster, His World and Music|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/7365/1/OConnell_ETD2007.pdf|access-date=June 25, 2016}}</ref>

Historian JoAnne O'Connell speculates in her biography, ''The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster'', that Foster may have killed himself, a common occurrence during the Civil War.<ref>{{Cite book|last=O'Connell|first=JoAnne|title=The Life and Songs of Stephen Foster: a Revealing Portrait of the Forgotten Man Behind Swanee River, Beautiful Dreamer, and My Old Kentucky Home|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2016|isbn=9781442253865|location=Lanham, MD|pages=321}}</ref> George Cooper, who was with Foster until he died, said: "He lay there on the floor, naked, suffering horribly. He had wonderful big brown eyes, and they looked up at me with an appeal I can never forget. He whispered, 'I'm done for.'" Unlike Foster's brother Morrison, who was not in New York and said Foster was ill and cut his neck on a washbasin, Cooper mentioned no broken crockery and also said Foster had a "large knife" for cutting up apples and turnips. Morrison may have covered up Foster's suicide. Evelyn Morneweck, Morrison's daughter, also said the family would have covered up the suicide of their uncle if they could have.

As O'Connell and musicologist Ken Emerson have noted, several of the songs Foster wrote during the last years of his life foreshadow his death, such as "The Little Ballad Girl" and "Kiss Me Dear Mother Ere I Die." Emerson says in his 2010 ''Stephen Foster and Co.'' that Foster's injuries may have been "accidental or self-inflicted."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Emerson|first=Ken|title=Stephen Foster and Co.: Lyrics of America's First Great Popular Songs|publisher=Library of America|year=2010|isbn=978-1598530704|location=New York|pages=10}}</ref> [[File:Western Union Telegram reporting Foster's death Jan 14 1864.JPG |thumb|Telegram that communicated Stephen Foster's death addressed to his brother Morrison Foster]]
When Foster died, his leather wallet contained a scrap of paper that simply said, "Dear friends and gentle hearts", along with 37 cents (one for each year of his life) in Civil War scrip and three pennies. The note is said to have inspired [[Bob Hilliard]]'s lyric for "[[Dear Hearts and Gentle People]]" (1949). Foster was buried in the [[Allegheny Cemetery]] in Pittsburgh. After his death, Morrison Foster became his "literary executor". As such, he answered requests for copies of manuscripts, autographs, and biographical information.<ref name="Root"/>
One of the best-loved of his works was "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]", published in 1864 (posthumously).<ref>{{cite web |title= The Last Chapter |url= http://www.stephen-foster-songs.de/end.htm |work= Stephen Collins Foster |publisher= W.

Foster grew up in a section of the city where many European immigrants had settled and was accustomed to hearing the music of the Italian, Scots-Irish, and German residents. He composed his first song when he was 14 and entitled it the "Tioga Waltz". The first song that he had published was "Open thy Lattice Love" (1844).<ref name=CFAM>{{cite web | title= Foster Hall Collection, Collection Number: CAM.FHC.2011.01, Guide to Archives and Manuscript Collections at the University of Pittsburgh Library System |publisher= University of Pittsburgh, Center for American Music

Foster also authored many church hymns, although the inclusion of his hymns in hymnals ended by 1910. Some of the hymns are "Seek and ye shall find",<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.hymnary.org/hymn/WCH1863/106|title=Waters' Choral Harp: a new and superior collection of choice hymns and tunes, mostly new, written and composed for Sunday schools, missionary, revival, and social meetings, and for church worship 106.

Foster usually sent his handwritten scores directly to his publishers. The publishers kept the sheet music manuscripts and did not give them to libraries nor return them to his heirs. Some of his original, hand-written scores were bought and put into private collections and the [[Library of Congress]].<ref name=Root/>

===Popular songs===
Foster's songs, lyrics, and melodies have often been altered by publishers and performers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Steel |first1=David Warren |title= The New Encyclopedia of Southern Culture; Volume 12: Music; Foster, Stephen (1826–1864) COMPOSER AND SONGWRITER. |date=2008 |publisher= University of North Carolina Press |jstor= 10.5149/9781469616667_malone.86 |postscript=: Access provided by the University of Pittsburgh}}</ref> [[Ray Charles]] released a version of "Old Folks at Home" that was titled "Swanee River Rock (Talkin’ ’Bout That River)," which became his first pop hit in November 1957.<ref>Whitburn, Joel, Top R&B Singles, 1942–1999, p. 74.</ref>

"[[My Old Kentucky Home]]" is the official state song of Kentucky, adopted by the General Assembly on March 19, 1928. "[[Old Folks at Home]]" became the official state song of Florida, designated in 1935.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flheritage.com/facts/symbols/symbol.cfm?id=22 |title=The State Anthem: "Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)" |publisher=State of Florida |access-date=April 29, 2011}}</ref> The lyrics are widely regarded as racist today, however, so "Old Folks at Home" was modified with approval from the [[Stephen Foster Memorial]]. The modified song was kept as the official state song, while "[[Florida (Where the Sawgrass Meets the Sky)]]" was added as the state anthem.

===Musical influence===
* Many early filmmakers selected Foster's songs for their work because his copyrights had expired and cost them nothing.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lerner |first=Neil |date=September 2006 |title=Review: Tunes for 'Toons': Music and the Hollywood Cartoon by Daniel Goldmark |journal=Notes: Quarterly Journal of the Music Library Association |volume=63 |number=1 |pages=121–124 |jstor=4487739}}</ref>
* Professor of Folklore and musician John Minton wrote a song titled "Stephen C. Foster's Blues".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://myspace.com/thepossumtrotorchestra/music/song/stephen-c.-foster-s-blues-74384088-82081738 |title=Stephen C. Foster's Blues |publisher=The Possum Trot Orchestra |access-date=May 10, 2015}}</ref>
* Erika M. Anderson, of the band EMA, refers to Foster's "Camptown Races" in the song "California", from ''past Life Martyred Saints'' (2011): "I bet my money on the bobtail nag/somebody bet on the bay."<ref>{{cite web |title=E.M.A. – California Lyrics|url=http://www.songlyrics.com/e-m-a/california-lyrics/ |publisher=SongLyrics |access-date=August 4, 2012}}</ref>
* The Firesign Theatre makes many references to Foster's compositions in their CD, ''Boom Dot Bust'' (1999, Rhino Records)
* Larry Kirwan of [[Black 47]] mixes the music of Foster with his own in the musical'' [[Hard Times (musical)|Hard Times]]'', which earned a ''[[New York Times]]'' accolade in its original run: "a knockout entertainment". Kirwan gives a contemporary interpretation of Foster's troubled later years and sets it in the tumultuous time of the New York draft riots and the Irish–Negro relations of the period. A revival ran at the [[Cell Theater]] in New York in early 2014, and a revised version of the musical, called ''Paradise Square'' opened at [[Berkeley Repertory Theatre]] in 2018.
*[[Gordon Lightfoot]] wrote a song in 1970 titled  "Your Love's Return (Song for Stephen Foster)"
*[[Lindley Armstrong Jones|Spike Jones]] recorded a comedy send-up "I Dream of Brownie with the Light Blue Jeans."
* Humorist [[Stanley Victor Freberg|Stan Freberg]] imagined a 1950s style version of Foster's music in "Rock Around Stephen Foster" and, with Harry Shearer, had a sketch about Foster having writer's block in a bit from his "United States of America" project.
* Songwriter [[Tom Shaner]] mentions Stephen Foster meeting up with Eminem's alter ego "Slim Shady" on the Bowery in Shaner's song "Rock & Roll is A Natural Thing."
* The music of Stephen Foster was an early influence on the Australian composer [[Percy Grainger]], who stated that hearing "[[Camptown Races]]" sung by his mother was one of his earliest musical recollections. He went on to write a piece entitled "Tribute to Foster", a composition for mixed choir, orchestra, and pitched wine glasses based on the melody of "Camptown Races."<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Source guide to the music of Percy Grainger|date=1991|publisher=Pro/Am Music Resources|others=Lewis, Thomas P.|isbn=9780912483566|edition= 1st |location=White Plains, N.Y.|oclc=24019532}}</ref>

===Television===
* Two television shows about the life of Foster and his childhood friend (and later wife) Jane MacDowell were produced in Japan, the first in 1979 with 13 episodes, and the second from 1992 to 1993 with 52 episodes; both were titled ''[[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair (TV series)|Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair]]'' after the song of the same name.
* In the ''[[The Honeymooners|Honeymooners]]'' episode, "The $99,000 Answer," Ralph Kramden studies decades' worth of popular songs for his upcoming appearance on a television [[game show]]. Before each song, Ed Norton warms up on the piano by playing the opening to "Swanee River." On the program, Ralph is asked his first question for just 100 dollars: "Who is the composer of 'Swanee River'?" Ralph freezes, then nervously responds "Ed Norton?" and loses.
* In a "Fractured Fairy Tales" segment of ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show]]'', Aladdin finds a lamp with a female [[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair|genie with light brown hair]], who immediately asks, "Are you Stephen Foster?"

===Film===
* Three Hollywood films have been made of Foster's life: ''[[Harmony Lane]]'' (1935) with [[Douglass Montgomery]], ''[[Swanee River (film)|Swanee River]]'' (1939) with [[Don Ameche]], and ''[[I Dream of Jeanie (film)|I Dream of Jeanie]]'' (1952), with [[Bill Shirley]]. The 1939 production was one of [[Twentieth Century Fox]]'s more ambitious efforts, filmed in [[Technicolor]]; the other two were low-budget affairs made by [[B-movie]] studios.
* In the film ''[[Tombstone (film)|Tombstone]]'' (1993), [[Billy Clanton]] (played by [[Thomas Haden Church]]) tries to bait [[Doc Holliday]] ([[Val Kilmer]]), who is playing a [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] [[nocturne]] on the piano, by saying, "Is that 'Old Dog Tray'? That sounds like 'Old Dog Tray' to me." When the goad fails, Clanton asks whether Doc knows any other songs, like "'Camptown Races?', 'Oh Susanna', "You know, Stephen stinkin' Foster?!?"
* In the film ''[[A Million Ways to Die in the West]]'', [[Seth MacFarlane]]'s character Albert can't get Foster's song "If You've Only Got a Mustache", from the previous scene, out of his head. [[Charlize Theron]]'s character suggests singing a different song, to which he replies, "There are only like 3 songs," and she adds "And they're all by Stephen Foster".
* In the 1949 film ''[[Mighty Joe Young (1949 film)|Mighty Joe Young]]'' the character Jill Young ([[Terry Moore (actress)|Terry Moore]]) is able to calm her pet 12-foot-tall gorilla by whistling or playing "[[Beautiful Dreamer]]".

===Other events===
* "Stephen Foster! Super Saturday" is a day of [[thoroughbred]] racing during the Spring/Summer meet at [[Churchill Downs]] in [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. During the call to the post, selections of Stephen Foster songs are played by the track bugler, Steve Buttleman. The day is headlined by the [[Stephen Foster Handicap]], a Grade I dirt race for older horses at 9 furlongs.
*[[36 U.S.C.]] §140 designates January 13 as [[Stephen Foster Memorial Day]], a [[List of observances in the United States by presidential proclamation|United States National Observance]].

* A public [[Stephen Foster (sculpture)|sculpture]] by [[Giuseppe Moretti]] honoring Foster and commemorating his song "Uncle Ned" sat in close proximity to the Stephen Foster Memorial until 2018.  The statue was removed following complaints about the banjo-playing slave seated next to Foster.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/oh-susanna-songwriter-s-statue-removed-amid-criticism-n869321|title='Oh!

A painting by [[Howard Chandler Christy]] entitled, "Stephen Foster and the Angel of Genius" is on display in the park's art collection. The painting inspired [[Florence Foster Jenkins]] to author a tableau in which she personally plays the role of the angel depicted in Christy's painting. The scene was featured in the film ''[[Florence Foster Jenkins (film)|Florence Foster Jenkins]]'' in 2016.

==Accolades and honors==
[[File:The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe at the archives.jpg|thumb|left|75px|The Stephen Collins Foster sketchbook kept in a safe in the research library in the memorial]]
[[File:StephenFosterWinter.jpg|thumb|right|Pitt's [[Stephen Foster Memorial]] contains two theaters]]
Foster is honored on the [[University of Pittsburgh]] campus with the [[Stephen Foster Memorial]], a landmark building that houses the Stephen Foster Memorial Museum, the Center for American Music, as well as two theaters: the Charity Randall Theatre and Henry Heymann Theatre, both performance spaces for Pitt's Department of Theater Arts. It is the largest repository for original Stephen Foster compositions, recordings, and other memorabilia his songs have inspired worldwide.

Two state parks are named in Foster's honor: the [[Stephen Foster Folk Culture Center State Park]] in [[White Springs, Florida]] and [[Stephen C. Foster State Park]] in Georgia. Both parks are on the [[Suwannee River]]. Stephen Foster Lake at [[Mount Pisgah State Park]] in Pennsylvania is also named in his honor.

One state park is named in honor of Foster's songs, [[My Old Kentucky Home State Park|My Old Kentucky Home]], an historic mansion formerly named Federal Hill, located in [[Bardstown, Kentucky]] where Stephen is said to have been an occasional visitor according to his brother, Morrison Foster. The park dedicated a bronze statue in honor of Stephen's work.

The [[Lawrenceville (Pittsburgh)]] Historical Society, together with the [[Allegheny Cemetery]] Historical Association, hosts the annual Stephen Foster Music and Heritage Festival (Doo Dah Days!). Held the first weekend of July, Doo Dah Days! celebrates the life and music of one of the most influential songwriters in America's history. His home in the Lawrenceville Section of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]], still remains on Penn Avenue nearby the Stephen Foster Community Center.

A 1900 [[Stephen Foster (sculpture)|statue]] of Foster by [[Giuseppe Moretti]] was located in [[Schenley Plaza]], in Pittsburgh, from 1940 until 2018. On the unanimous recommendation of the Pittsburgh Art Commission, the statue was removed on April 26, 2018.<ref name=PCGoneAmok>{{cite news |title= 'Oh Susanna' songwriter's statue removed amid criticism |url= https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/oh-susanna-songwriters-statue-removed-amid-criticism-145527999.html |access-date= April 26, 2018 |agency= Associated Press |date= April 26, 2018 }}</ref> Its new home has not yet been determined. It has a long reputation as the most controversial public art in Pittsburgh "for its depiction of an African-American banjo player at the feet of the seated composer. Critics say the statue glorifies white appropriation of black culture, and depicts the vacantly smiling musician in a way that is at best condescending and at worst racist."<ref>{{cite news
