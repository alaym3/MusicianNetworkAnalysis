He was featured on the TV show, ''[[Wildboyz]]''. During an appearance on the [[Howard Stern]] radio show, Knoxville promoted Wade's songs, which were favorably received by Stern and his audience and given frequent airplay thereafter.
 	
Wade's lyrics satirically and detrimentally deal with topics and stereotypes relating to [[Redneck (stereotype)|redneck]] and [[honky tonk]] culture. Before nearly every live song, Roger states, "this is a song about a girl". He co-wrote the hit song "[[Country State of Mind]]" with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metrolyrics.com/country-state-of-mind-lyrics-hank-williams-jr.html |title=Hank Williams Jr. – Country State Of Mind Lyrics |publisher=MetroLyrics |date=March 15, 2016 |accessdate=March 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.outlawmagazine.tv/content/brandy-lee-dixon-interviews-roger-alan-wade/ |title=Roger Alan Wade |website=Outlaw Magazine |date=September 27, 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2017}}</ref>

His songs feature [[folk music|folky]] arrangements, featuring little or no accompaniment beyond [[Steel-string acoustic guitar|acoustic guitar]].  His best known compositions include "BB Gun", "Butt Ugly Slut", "D-R-U-N-K", "Poontang", and "If You're Gonna Be Dumb". Wade's lesser known works are less hysterical and carry a more lyrical tone including "The First Time I Saw Waylon", "Brainerd Road", and "Jingle Jangle". Two other famous Wade songs, "Party in My Pants" and "If You're Gonna Be Dumb, You Gotta Be Tough", were featured in the hit 2010 movie ''[[Jackass 3D]]''. Wade wrote "The Light Outlives the Star" for a friend of his daughter who died in an automobile accident. It later served as a tribute to his friend and fan, [[Ryan Dunn]], who died in a car accident on June 20, 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/a328144/jackass-cast-pay-tribute-to-ryan-dunn-video/ |title='Jackass' cast pay tribute to Ryan Dunn |website=Digital Spy |date=July 4, 2011 |access-date=April 5, 2019}}</ref>
