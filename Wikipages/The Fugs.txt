'''The Fugs''' are an American band formed in New York City in late 1964,<ref name=":0" /> by the poets [[Ed Sanders]] and [[Tuli Kupferberg]], with [[Ken Weaver (musician)|Ken Weaver]] on drums. Soon afterward, they were joined by [[Peter Stampfel]] and Steve Weber of [[The Holy Modal Rounders]]. Kupferberg named the band from a [[euphemism]] for ''[[fuck]]'' used in [[Norman Mailer]]'s novel ''[[The Naked and the Dead]]''.

The band was one of the leaders of the [[Underground culture|underground scene]] of the 1960s and became an important part of the American [[counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture of that decade]].<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=125628216 "The Fugs: At The Forefront Of The Counterculture"] by John Kalish, ''[[All Things Considered]]'', [[NPR]], April 6, 2010</ref> The group is known for its comedic, even lewd, nature but also earned fame through their persistent anti-Vietnam War sentiment during the 1960s.<ref name=":0" /> Some 1969 correspondence, found inside an [[FBI]] file on the rock group [[The Doors]], called The Fugs the "most vulgar thing the human mind could possibly conceive".<ref>[https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/bj7x85/fbi-foia-the-fugs-the-doors-v24n8 Leopold, Jason, "Inside the FBI's File on The Fugs: The 'Most Vulgar Thing the Human Mind Could Possibly Conceive'".] Noisey.vice.com, Retrieved November 12, 2017</ref>

==Formation==
The band's original core members, Ed Sanders, Tuli Kupferberg, and Ken Weaver, were joined at various times in the 1960s by a number of others, some of whom were noted session musicians or members of other bands. These included Weber and Stampfel,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.furious.com/perfect/tuli.html|title=The Fugs – Tuli Kupferberg|website=Furious.com}}</ref> bassist John Anderson, guitarist Vinny Leary, guitarist Peter Kearney, keyboardist Lee Crabtree, guitarist Jon Kalb, guitarist [[Stefan Grossman]], singer and guitarist Jake Jacobs, guitarist [[Eric Gale]], bassist [[Chuck Rainey]], keyboardist Robert Banks, bassist Charles Larkey, guitarist Ken Pine, guitarist [[Danny Kortchmar]], clarinetist [[Perry Robinson]], bassist Bill Wolf, and drummer Bob Mason.

For most of their career, the Fugs were composed of the primary singer-songwriters Sanders and, until his death, Kupferberg; the composer, songwriter, guitarist and long-time [[Allen Ginsberg]] collaborator Steven Taylor; singer-songwriter and percussionist Coby Batty; and Scott Petito, a musician and music producer.

The band signed a record contract with [[ESP-Disk]] in 1965. The Fugs said that "our royalty rate was less than 3%, one of the lower percentages in the history of western civilization".<ref name=":0">{{cite web|website=Thefugs.com|title=History of the Fugs|url=http://www.thefugs.com/history2.html|access-date=26 November 2013}}</ref> The owner of the label, [[Bernard Stollman]], has frequently faced accusation of not paying [[royalties]] to artists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Weiss|first=Jason|title=Always in Trouble: An Oral History of ESP-Disk', the Most Outrageous Record Label in America|year=2012|publisher=Wesleyan|isbn=978-0-8195-7159-5|url=http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/dignity-conviction-and-mrs-stollmans-checkbook/}}</ref> In February 1967, the group was signed to [[Atlantic Records]] and recorded one album, ''The Fugs Eat It'', but it was never released.<ref name="history3">[[Ed Sanders|Sanders, Ed]].

==Career==
A [[satirical]] rock band with a political slant, the Fugs have performed at various war protests – against the Vietnam War and since the 1980s at events around other U.S. involved wars. The band's often frank and humorous lyrics about sex, drugs, and politics<ref name=":1" /> occasionally generated hostile reactions, most notably from the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the late 1960s. The group is referenced several times in the F.B.I. file on the [[The Doors|Doors]]; an excerpt mentions eleven songs from ''The Fugs First Album'' that are "vulgar and repulsive and are most suggestive".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vault.fbi.gov/The%20Doors/The%20Doors%20Part%201%20of%201/view |title=The Doors Part 1 of 1 |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |access-date=19 January 2012}}</ref>

In 1968, they toured Europe twice: in May to Denmark and Sweden where they wrote the song "The Swedish Nada"<ref name="history3" /> and played with [[Fleetwood Mac]], [[Ten Years After]], and [[The Nice]];<ref name="RP102">[http://rockprosopography102.blogspot.com/2010/09/fugs-family-tree-performance-list.html "The Fugs Family Tree – shows list"], Rock Prosopography 102</ref> and in September to Germany where they played with [[Peter Brötzmann]], [[Cuby and the Blizzards]], [[Family (band)|Family]], [[Guru Guru|Guru Guru Groove]], [[Alexis Korner]], [[David Peel (musician)|David Peel]], [[Tangerine Dream]], at the Internationale Essener Songtage in the [[Grugahalle]] in Essen.<ref name="RP102" /><ref>[http://www.pwf.cz/archivy/texts/readings/ed-sanders-a-visit-to-prague_116.html "A Visit to Prague"] by [[Ed Sanders]], ''Woodstock Journal'', November 29, 2007; via [[Prague Writers' Festival]], October 2018</ref>

In a 2012 interview with [[National Public Radio]], Ed Sanders read a leaflet from an August 1965 show: "The Fugs present: Night of napalm, songs against the war, rock n' roll bomb shrieks, heavy metal orgasms! Watch all The Fugs die in a napalm raid!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/05/05/152029486/fug-you-the-wild-life-of-ed-sanders|title='Fug You': The Wild Life of Ed Sanders|last=Kalish|first=Jon|date=May 4, 2012|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=October 17, 2012}}</ref>

Their participation in the [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam]]'s 1967 [[National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam#March on the Pentagon|March on the Pentagon]], at which they and others purportedly attempted to encircle and levitate the Pentagon, is chronicled in [[Norman Mailer]]'s book ''[[The Armies of the Night]]''. A recording of this event is featured on the Fugs' 1968 album, ''Tenderness Junction,'' entitled "Exorcising the Evil Spirits from the Pentagon Oct. 21, 1967".<ref name=":2">The Fugs. "Exorcising the Evil Spirits From Within the Pentagon Oct. 21, 1967", ''Tenderness Junction,'' Reprise, 1968.</ref> Beforehand, Sanders and Kupferberg had prepared an elaborate exorcism ritual, and rented a flatbed truck along with a sound system.<ref name=":0" /> As is heard on the album, the two gathered a large crowd in front of the Pentagon and repeatedly chanted, "Out, demons, out!"<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" />

One of their better-known songs is an adaptation of [[Matthew Arnold]]'s poem "[[Dover Beach]]". Others were settings of [[William Blake]]'s poems "[[Ah! Sun-flower]]" and "How Sweet I Roam'd". Another, "Nothing", is a paraphrasing of the Yiddish folk song "Bulbes".<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldsmith|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Goldsmith|title=Duchamp Is My Lawyer: The Polemics, Pragmatics, and Poetics of [[UbuWeb]]|year=2020|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=246|isbn=9780231546911}}</ref>

After pursuing individual projects over the years, in 1984 Sanders and Kupferberg decided to re-form the band and stage a series of Fugs reunion concerts.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">Kot, Greg. "The Fugs Still Riotous After All These Years". ''Chicago Tribune'', November 27, 2012. [http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-11-27/entertainment/chi-fugs-interview-20121127_1_fugs-tuli-kupferberg-coby-batty]</ref> On August 15, 1988, at the Byrdcliff Barn in Woodstock, New York, the Fugs performed one of their first real reunion concerts. This incarnation of the Fugs included, at various times, the guitarist and singer Steve Taylor (who was also Allen Ginsberg's teaching assistant at the Naropa Institute), the drummer and singer Coby Batty, the bassist [[Mark Kramer]], the guitarist Vinny Leary (who had contributed to the first two original Fugs albums), and the bassist and keyboardist Scott Petito. The re-formed Fugs performed concerts at numerous locations in the United States and Europe over the next several years.

In 1994 the band intended to perform a series of concerts in [[Woodstock, New York]], (where Sanders had lived for many years) to commemorate the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]], which had actually occurred near the town of Bethel, some 50 miles away. They learned that a group of promoters were planning to stage [[Woodstock '94]] that August near Saugerties, about 8 miles from Woodstock, and that this festival would be much more tightly controlled and commercialized than the original. Consequently, The Fugs decided to stage their own August 1994 concerts as "The Real Woodstock Festival", in an atmosphere more in keeping with the spirit of the 1969 festival. The basic Fugs roster of Sanders, Kupferberg, Taylor, Batty, and Petito performed in this series of concerts with additional vocal support from Amy Fradon and Leslie Ritter and also with appearances by Allen Ginsberg and [[Country Joe McDonald]]. In 2003, the group released ''The Fugs Final CD (Part 1)'' with positive feedback. In 2004, The Fugs began to record ''Be Free: The Fugs Final CD (Part 2)''.

In 2008 their song "CIA Man" was featured during the end credits for the movie ''[[Burn After Reading]]'', directed by the [[Coen brothers]]. In 2009, Kupferberg suffered two [[stroke]]s, the latter of which severely hindered his eyesight. He was under constant care, but was able to finish recording his tracks for ''Be Free'' in his New York City apartment. A benefit for Kupferberg was held in [[Brooklyn]], New York, in February 2010, featuring all of the Fugs minus Kupferberg, as well as [[Lou Reed]], [[Sonic Youth]], [[Patti Smith Group]] guitarist [[Lenny Kaye]], and others. ''Be Free: The Fugs Final CD (Part 2)'' was released on February 23, 2010. The album art, designed by Sanders, featured a snail reading Allen Ginsberg's poem "[[Howl]]". The album was produced by Taylor and Sanders.

Kupferberg died on July 12, 2010, in [[Manhattan]], at the age of 86.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010b.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club 2010 July to December|website=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com|access-date=January 22, 2020}}</ref> In 2008, in one of his last interviews, he told ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine, "Nobody who lived through the '50s thought the '60s could've existed. So there's always hope."<ref>''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', no. 203, October 2010, p. 34.</ref>

The remaining Fugs from time to time seriously consider further performances.<ref name="history3" /><ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com" /> On June 11, 2011, the four remaining Fugs performed at [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]] in London as part of the annual [[Meltdown Festival]], curated that year by [[Ray Davies]] of the [[The Kinks|Kinks]]. Their set received a four-star review in ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/13/the-fugs-review Review of the Fugs], ''[[The Guardian]]''</ref>

They performed at the Beachland Ballroom in Cleveland on November 30, 2012, and at the City Winery in Chicago on December 1, 2012 .

==Film appearances==
The band can be seen performing in the [[cult film]] ''[[Chappaqua (film)|Chappaqua]]'' (1967) by [[Conrad Rooks]]. [[Tuli Kupferberg]] made appearances in ''[[W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism]]'' (1971) by [[Dušan Makavejev]] and played God in ''[[Voulez-vous coucher avec God?]]'' (1972) by [[Michael Hirsh (producer)|Michael Hirsh]] and Jack Christie.

Their song, "CIA Man", can be heard during the closing credits of the 2008 [[Coen Brothers]]' film ''[[Burn After Reading]]'', and during the closing credits of the fifth episode of the 2017 docudrama miniseries ''[[Wormwood (miniseries)|Wormwood]]''.
