'''The Knife''' were a Swedish [[electronic music]] duo from [[Gothenburg]], formed in 1999. The group consisted of siblings [[Karin Dreijer|Karin]] and [[Olof Dreijer]], who together also run their own record company, [[Rabid Records]]. They gained a large international following in response to their 2003 album ''[[Deep Cuts (The Knife album)|Deep Cuts]]''.

The duo's first tour took place in 2006, along with the release of their critically acclaimed album ''[[Silent Shout]]''. They have won a number of Swedish [[Grammis]], but refuse to attend awards ceremonies. They have appeared in public wearing [[Venetian mask]]s. Karin released a [[Fever Ray (album)|solo album]] under the name [[Fever Ray]] in 2009, while Olof released several EPs as [[Oni Ayhun]] in late 2009 and early 2010. The Knife disbanded in November 2014 after releasing their acclaimed 2013 album ''[[Shaking the Habitual]]'' and completing its attendant [[Shaking The Habitual Tour|tour]].

==History==
Formed in [[Gothenburg]] in 1999,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=104&artikel=1174970 |title=Grammisregn över Göteborg |language=sv |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=31 January 2007 |access-date=24 May 2014}}</ref><ref name="biography">{{cite web |last=McLean |first=Craig |url=http://www.theknife.net/o0ooooo.html |title=Biography |publisher=theknife.net |date=January 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100414053323/http://www.theknife.net/o0ooooo.html |archive-date=14 April 2010 |access-date=8 March 2010}}</ref> amidst the deterioration of Karin's former group [[Honey Is Cool]], the group perhaps gained stronger international recognition when [[José González (singer)|José González]] covered their song "[[Heartbeats (song)|Heartbeats]]" on his 2003 album, ''[[Veneer (album)|Veneer]]''. The cover was used by [[Sony]] in a commercial for [[BRAVIA]] television sets, and released as a single in 2006. The group commented on this in a ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' article, saying that Sony paid a large sum of money to use the song. Despite the group's anti-commercial views, they justified the transaction by citing their need for money to establish a record company.

Having never before performed live, the Knife went on tour in 2006, and after selling out shows worldwide, a [[DVD]] of the tour was announced. The DVD was released in Sweden on 8 November 2006, and is titled ''[[Silent Shout: An Audio Visual Experience]]''.

On 4 August 2009, the band announced that, in collaboration with [[Mount Sims|Mt. Sims]] and [[Planningtorock]], they would be writing an opera for the Danish performance group Hotel Pro Forma. The opera, titled ''[[Tomorrow, In a Year]]'', is based on [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. In January 2010, the band announced that they would release a studio version on 1 March.<ref>{{cite web |last=Jones |first=Charlie Robin |url=http://www.dummymag.com/features/2010/01/12/the-knife-interview-yes-/ |title=The Knife interview: "Yes!" |publisher=Dummy |date=12 January 2010 |access-date=24 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125200237/http://www.dummymag.com/features/2010/01/12/the-knife-interview-yes-/ |archive-date=25 January 2010 }}</ref>

In a September 2010 post on the official Fever Ray website, Karin stated that the siblings had "started playing together again", hinting that new material might be on the way.<ref>{{cite web |last=Dreijer |first=Karin |author-link=Karin Dreijer Andersson |url=http://feverray.com/2010/09/23/hi/ |title=Hi... |publisher=feverray.com |date=23 September 2010 |access-date=18 October 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101006005849/http://feverray.com/2010/09/23/hi/ |archive-date=6 October 2010 }}</ref> On 18 April 2011, as part of a post on their website concerning discrimination against [[Romani people]] in Europe, the Knife announced that they were recording a new album to be released in 2012.<ref name="roma">{{cite web |url=http://theknife.net/take-action-for-the-housing-rights-of-roma-in-rome |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426022718/http://theknife.net/take-action-for-the-housing-rights-of-roma-in-rome |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 April 2011 |title=Take action for the housing rights of Roma in Rome! |publisher=theknife.net |date=18 April 2011 |access-date=23 April 2011 }}</ref> In December 2012, it was confirmed that their next album would be titled ''[[Shaking the Habitual]]'' and would be released on 8 April 2013.<ref>{{cite web |last=Phillips |first=Amy |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/48903-the-knife-return-with-new-album/ |title=The Knife Return With New Album |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=12 December 2012 |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref><ref name="tour2013">{{cite web |last=Minsker |first=Evan |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/48936-the-knife-reveal-album-release-date/ |title=The Knife Reveal Release Date, Will Tour Next Year |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=14 December 2012 |access-date=14 December 2012}}</ref> The duo posted a teaser trailer for the album on their YouTube account with the message: "Music can be so meaningless.

After announcing their plans to play at [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]] in April 2014, the Knife also announced plans to tour North America during that time period.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pelly |first1=Jenn |last2=Minsker |first2=Evan |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/50800-the-knife-to-tour-north-america-surrounding-coachella/ |title=The Knife to Tour North America Surrounding Coachella |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=9 January 2014 |access-date=10 January 2014}}</ref> On 21 August 2014, the Knife announced that the duo would disband following the final six dates of their Shaking the Habitual Show Tour from 31 October to 8 November 2014.<ref>{{cite web |last=Gordon |first=Jeremy |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/56416-the-knife-call-it-quits/ |title=The Knife Call It Quits |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=21 August 2014 |access-date=21 August 2014}}</ref> In the duo's final interview, Karin told ''[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed]]'', "We don't have any obligations to continue, it should only and always be for fun."<ref>{{cite web |last=Denney |first=Alex |url=http://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/21359/1/the-knife-are-no-more-read-their-last-interview |title=The Knife are no more – read their last interview |work=[[Dazed & Confused (magazine)|Dazed]] |date=21 August 2014 |access-date=21 August 2014}}</ref>

The Knife played their final show, entitled "Post-Colonial Gender Politics Come First, Music Comes Second", on 8 November 2014 at the Iceland Airwaves Festival in Reykjavik. The final performance was recorded and released as a concert film and a special edition vinyl set.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Monroe|first=Jazz|title=Watch the Knife's New Concert Film|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/watch-the-knifes-new-concert-film/|access-date=2020-11-30|website=Pitchfork|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Subscribe|title=The Knife have shared their 'Live At Terminal 5' film|url=https://diymag.com/2017/09/01/the-knife-shared-live-at-terminal-5-film-watch|access-date=2020-11-30|website=diymag.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbdXdsDKoLo</ref>

==Relationship with the media==
The Knife rarely cooperated with the media or the mainstream music scene. Until 2005, they did not perform live concerts. The group rarely made public appearances; most of their promotional photos featured the members wearing masks with birds' beaks, similar to the traditional [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Venetian mask#Medico_Della_Peste_(The_Plague_Doctor)|Medico Della Peste]] (plague doctor) masks worn during [[Carnival of Venice|Carnival]].

The Knife won the [[Grammis|Swedish Grammis]] award for Pop Group of the Year in 2003, but they boycotted the ceremony by sending two representatives of the [[Guerrilla Girls]], with the number 50 written on their costumes, as a protest against male dominance in the music industry.<ref name="foley">{{cite web |last=Foley |first=Jack |url=http://www.indielondon.co.uk/music/mu_knife_bio.html |title=The Knife – Swedish duo hoping to cut it in synth-pop world |publisher=IndieLondon |access-date=9 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303190149/http://www.indielondon.co.uk/music/mu_knife_bio.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Their album ''[[Deep Cuts (The Knife album)|Deep Cuts]]'' was also nominated for the best record of the year, although that award went to [[The Cardigans]]. At the Grammis awards in 2007, the Knife won in all six categories that they were nominated in: Composer of the Year, Music DVD of the Year, Producer of the Year, Pop Group of the Year, Album of the Year and Artist of the Year. Again, they did not attend the award ceremony. On another occasion, they did not come to collect the award but sent a manipulated video that muffled their voices and made them look very elderly.

''[[Silent Shout]]'' was named the best album of 2006 by [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/6510-top-50-albums-of-2006/5/ |title=Top 50 Albums of 2006 |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=19 December 2006 |access-date=4 July 2008}}</ref> The song "[[We Share Our Mothers' Health]]" from the album was made available for free as the [[iTunes Store]]'s Single of the Week in late 2006.

==Influences==
In a 2006 interview with ''Pitchfork'', the Knife cited [[David Lynch]], [[Aki Kaurismäki]], [[cinema of Korea|Korean cinema]], ''[[Trailer Park Boys]]'', ''[[Donnie Darko]]'' and ''[[Doom (series)|Doom]]'' as inspirations for their work.<ref>{{cite web |last=Pytlik |first=Mark |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6387-the-knife/ |title=Interviews: The Knife |publisher=Pitchfork Media |date=24 July 2006 |access-date=4 July 2011}}</ref> In addition, Karin named [[Sonic Youth]], [[Kate Bush]], [[Le Tigre]] and [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]], while Olof cited [[techno]], [[grime (music)|grime]] and [[Southern hip hop]].<ref name="foley"/>

==Solo projects==
In 2008, Karin announced the release of a solo album under the name Fever Ray in March 2009. The [[Fever Ray (album)|eponymous album]] was digitally released in advance of this date. The single "[[If I Had a Heart]]" was featured in [[Open House (Breaking Bad)|a 2011 episode of ''Breaking Bad'']] and in the 2013 film ''[[Horns (film)|Horns]]'', is the opening theme of the Canadian-Irish historical drama television series ''[[Vikings (2013 TV series)|Vikings]]'', and is the opening of the movie ''[[Laurence Anyways]]'' by Quebec director [[Xavier Dolan]], who also used Karin's song "Keep the Streets Empty For Me" in his movie ''[[Heartbeats (2010 film)|Les Amours Imaginaires]]''. In a 2016 interview with The Fader, Karin related that they are currently working on more solo music, though they are "unsure" if it will be under the ''Fever Ray'' moniker or not.<ref>{{cite web |last=Maine |first=Sammie |url=http://www.nme.com/news/fever-ray/91623 |title=A new Fever Ray album could be on its way |work=[[NME]] |date=17 February 2016 |access-date=20 April 2016}}</ref>

Olof performs as both DJ Coolof and Oni Ayhun.
