'''Capone-N-Noreaga''' (also known as '''C-N-N''') is an [[United States|American]] [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] duo formed in 1995 from [[Queens]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The duo features East Coast rappers [[Capone (rapper)|Capone]] and [[N.O.R.E.]].<ref name="hiphopdx1">{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.15477/title.nore-announces-capone-n-noreaga-has-disbanded|title=N.O.R.E.

==History==
In October 1995, Capone-N-Noreaga appeared in ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine's "Unsigned Hype" column. In 1996, the duo secured a recording contract with [[Neil Levine]]'s [[Penalty Recordings]]. In 1996, before the group’s debut album was completed, Capone was jailed for a parole violation,<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/caponennoreaga/biography]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113155010/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/caponennoreaga/biography |date=November 13, 2007 }}</ref> and Noreaga finished their debut album ''[[The War Report]]'', with the help of various fellow [[New York Hip-Hop|New York City hip-hop]] acts, including [[Mobb Deep]] and [[Tragedy Khadafi]]. The album was met with critical and commercial acclaim;<ref>{{cite web|title=The War Report : Overview|publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}</ref> it also saw the group partake in the [[East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry|conflict]] between [[Death Row Records]] and [[Bad Boy Entertainment]], making it a more widespread East Coast/West Coast rivalry, responding to [[West Coast hip hop]] duo [[Tha Dogg Pound]]'s single "[[New York, New York (Tha Dogg Pound song)|New York, New York]]", with their own rendition of "[[L.A L.A]]".

In 2000, the group released ''[[The Reunion (Capone-N-Noreaga album)|The Reunion]]'', their second album on [[Tommy Boy Records]]. The album was similarly star-studded but suffered from mixed reviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-reunion-mw0000616578|title=The Reunion : Overview|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|access-date=2014-09-17}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.10/title.capone-n-noreaga-the-reunion|title=HipHop DX|work=HipHopDX|access-date=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314143116/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/reviews/id.10/title.capone-n-noreaga-the-reunion|archive-date=14 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> Additionally, Capone had once again been sent to prison before its release for violating a probation sentence on gun possession,<ref>[http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2004/03/26/WhenKeepingItRealGoesWrong.aspx]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090221/http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2004/03/26/WhenKeepingItRealGoesWrong.aspx |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> which undermined promotion of the album. Soon after, in 2001, Capone-n-Noreaga jumped ship to prominent label [[Def Jam]]. As Tommy Boy retained the rights to the names Capone-n-Noreaga and Noreaga, because the company claimed that the duo owed it more recordings, the group shortened its name to CNN, and Noreaga billed himself as N.O.R.E. (or NORE) for his solo work. The duo recorded a new album in 2003, titled ''New Religion'', with a lead single "[[Yes Sir|Yes, Sir]]," which was issued on [[mixtape]]s and promoted with a music video. The single failed to make an impact, and the album was ultimately shelved. A compilation of several tracks was released in 2004, entitled "What Up 2 Da Hood Thugged Out",

Later that year, the duo found itself implicated in a non-fatal shooting between rival hip-hop groups, one of which included fellow [[Brooklyn]]-based rapper [[Lil' Kim]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441041/20010227/lil_kim.jhtml|title=MTV News : Lil' Kim Present At Hot 97 Shootout, Police Say|work=MTV News|access-date=17 September 2014}}</ref> after a chance encounter outside New York radio station [[WQHT|Hot 97]]. Capone-n-Noreaga have denied any involvement in the shooting, for which the group was not charged.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1441083/20010228/lil_kim.jhtml|title=MTV News : Capone-n-Noreaga Deny Any Role In Hot 97 Shooting|work=MTV News|access-date=17 September 2014}}</ref> In early 2005, Def Jam released Capone from his contract while retaining N.O.R.E.;{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Capone released his solo debut album ''Pain, Time, and Glory'', later the same year.

In 2006, N.O.R.E. brought up the possibility of a Capone-n-Noreaga reunion and a new album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2006/12/01/18131784.aspx |title=AllHipHop.com : NORE talks about possible Capone-N-Noreaga reunion |work=AllHipHop.com |access-date=17 September 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116153518/http://allhiphop.com/blogs/news/archive/2006/12/01/18131784.aspx |archive-date=16 November 2007 }}</ref> On June 12, 2008, the duo released a [[mixtape]] titled ''Back on That Q.U.

''Channel 10'' was put together with the assistance of longtime friend DJ EFN. The album's lead single, titled "[[Rotate (song)|Rotate]]", features [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[Ron Browz]], and was produced by the latter. American record producers [[DJ Premier]], [[Havoc (Mobb Deep)|Havoc]], and [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]]—among others—also provided production for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.1283/title.capone-n-noreaga-the-raw-report/p.1|title=Capone-N-Noreaga: The Raw Report|work=HipHopDX|access-date=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226104014/http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/features/id.1283/title.capone-n-noreaga-the-raw-report/p.1|archive-date=26 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2010, the duo had teamed up once again to release their fourth album in June. The album, titled ''[[The War Report 2: Report the War]]'' as a [[sequel]] to their [[The War Report|debut]], was released to slight fanfare. At that point, the duo recalibrated and decided to return to focusing on solo efforts. In June 2011, N.O.R.E. announced via his [[Twitter]] account, that the group had disbanded and that he would continue to focus on his solo career.<ref name="hiphopdx1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/noreaga|title=N.O.R.E (noreaga) - Twitter|publisher=Twitter.com|access-date=17 September 2014}}</ref> In March 2013, N.O.R.E. and Capone called into radio personality [[Sway Calloway]]'s morning radio show, to announce they had once again reunited.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.2dopeboyz.com/2013/03/27/first-the-mobb-deep-make-up-now-capone-n-noreaga/|title=» First The Mobb Deep Make Up, Now Capone-N-Noreaga…|work=2DOPEBOYZ|access-date=17 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2013/03/capone-n-noreaga-reuniting-again|title=Capone-N-Noreaga Reuniting Again|author=Sam Weiss|date=27 March 2013|work=Complex|access-date=17 September 2014}}</ref>

In August 2016, the duo also had a collaboration with Supreme, a streetwear clothing company. This collaboration with Supreme is based on the duo's "The War Report" and includes a waffle thermal longsleeved crewneck shirt and shorts, t-shirt, hooded sweatshirt and a skateboard deck which features Capone-N-Noreaga's original album artwork from The War Report.
