'''The Magnetic Fields''' (named after the [[André Breton]]/[[Philippe Soupault]] novel ''[[Les Champs Magnétiques]]'')<ref>Morse, Erik. [http://www.interviewmagazine.com/blogs/music/2010-02-11/stephin-merritt-magnetic-fields-/ "The Magnetic Fields Get Real"], ''Interview Magazine'', February 11, 2010.</ref> are an American [[Band (rock and pop)|band]] founded and led by [[Stephin Merritt]]. Merritt is the group's primary songwriter, producer, and vocalist, as well as frequent multi-instrumentalist. The Magnetic Fields is essentially a vehicle for Merritt's songwriting, as are his various side-projects, including [[the 6ths]], [[Future Bible Heroes]], and [[the Gothic Archies]]. Merritt's lyrics are often about love and feature atypical or neutral gender roles, and are by turns ironic, tongue-in-cheek, bitter, and humorous.{{citation needed|date=October 2021|reason=While arguably true, without references, this gets into the realm of original research and editorializing.}}

The band released their debut single "[[100,000 Fireflies]]" in 1991. The single was typical of the band's earlier career, characterized by [[synthesizer|synthesized]] instrumentation by Merritt, with lead vocals provided by Susan Anway (and then by Stephin Merritt himself, from the ''[[The House of Tomorrow (album)|House of Tomorrow]]'' EP onwards). A more traditional band later materialized; it is now composed of Merritt, [[Claudia Gonson]], [[Sam Davol]], and John Woo, with occasional guest vocals by [[Shirley Simms]]. The band's best-known work{{by whom?|date=October 2021}} is the 1999 three-volume concept album ''[[69 Love Songs]]''. It was followed in the succeeding years by a "no-synth" trilogy: ''[[i (The Magnetic Fields album)|i]]'' (2004), ''[[Distortion (The Magnetic Fields album)|Distortion]]'' (2008),<ref>Thiessen, Brock.[http://exclaim.ca/articles/multiarticlesub.aspx?csid1=118&csid2=4&fid1=29288 " Magnetic Fields Feeds Back "], and ''[[Exclaim!]]'', February 2008.</ref> and ''[[Realism (The Magnetic Fields album)|Realism]]'' (2010). The band's latest album, ''[[Quickies]]'', was released on May 29, 2020.

==History==
The band began as Merritt's studio project under the name Buffalo Rome.<ref>LD Beghtol, ''69 Love Songs, A Field Guide'' (Continuum, 2006), p. 135</ref> With the help of friend [[Claudia Gonson]], who had played in Merritt's band the Zinnias during high school, a live band was assembled in [[Boston]], where Merritt and Gonson lived, to play Merritt's compositions. The band's first live performance was in 1991 at [[T.T. the Bear's Place]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], where they were mistakenly billed as Magnetophone, an alias used briefly in that year by [[Damon & Naomi|Damon Krukowski and Naomi Yang]] of [[Galaxie 500]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Deville|first=Chris|date=2020-08-25|title=Watch Stephin Merritt Serenade His Dogs With A Yoko Ono Cover|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2095989/magnetic-fields-stephin-merritt-yoko-ono-galaxie-500/news/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-01|website=Stereogum|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Aldridge|first=Andy|date=2007-03-04|title=Audio: Magnetophone (Damon & Naomi) - E.T.A.|url=https://www.fullofwishes.co.uk/2007/03/04/audio-magnetophone-damon-naomi-eta/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-12-01|website=A Head Full of Wishes|language=en}}</ref>

The 1999 triple album ''[[69 Love Songs]]'' showcased Merritt's songwriting and lyrical abilities and the group's musicianship, demonstrated by the use of such varied instruments as the ukulele, banjo, accordion, cello, mandolin, flute, [[xylophone]], and the [[Marxophone]], in addition to their usual setting of synthesizers, guitars, and effects. The album features vocalists [[Shirley Simms]], [[Dudley Klute]], [[LD Beghtol|L.D. Beghtol]], and Gonson, each of whom sings lead on six songs as well as various backing vocals, plus [[Daniel Handler]] (who has written under the pseudonym [[Lemony Snicket]]) on accordion, and longtime collaborator Christopher Ewen (of [[Future Bible Heroes]]) as guest arranger/synthesist. Violinist Ida Pearle makes a brief cameo on "Luckiest Guy on the Lower East Side".

The band's albums ''[[i (The Magnetic Fields album)|i]]'' (2004) and ''[[Distortion (The Magnetic Fields album)|Distortion]]'' (2008) both followed the album theme structure of ''69 Love Songs'': the song titles on ''i'' begin with the letter (or, in the case of half the songs' titles, the pronoun) "I", whilst ''Distortion'' was an experiment in combining [[noise music]] with their typically unconventional musical approach. The liner notes claim the album was made without synthesizers. According to an article, "To celebrate the release of ''Distortion'', Merritt and the Magnetic Fields played mini-residencies in cities around the country, culminating with six shows at Chicago's Old Town School of Folk Music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theredalert.com/features/magneticfields.php |title=The Magnetic Fields Interview - 2008 |publisher=The Red Alert |access-date=2012-02-23}}</ref>

''[[Realism (The Magnetic Fields album)|Realism]]'' was released in January 2010, concluding what Merritt termed the "no-synth" trilogy (following ''i'' and ''Distortion'').<ref>Baron, Zach. [http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2008/10/interview_magne.php "Interview: Stephin Merritt"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807071553/http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2008/10/interview_magne.php |date=2010-08-07 }}, ''The Village Voice'', October 1, 2008.</ref> The next album produced would feature synthesizers "almost exclusively".<ref>Gourlay, Dom.

In 2010, the documentary film ''Strange Powers: Stephin Merritt and the Magnetic Fields'' made its debut in film festivals around the world. It was directed by Kerthy Fix and [[Gail O'Hara]]. Shot over a period of 10 years, it discusses the formation of the band, Stephin's friendship with Claudia Gonson, the production of various albums, and Stephin's move to California from New York. It won the Outfest 2010 Grand Jury Prize for Feature Documentary.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/marine-story-tops-outfest-awards-25634|title='A Marine Story' tops Outfest awards|date=July 18, 2010|first=Gregg|last=Kilday|agency=AP|work=Hollywood Reporter}}</ref>

The band was chosen by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] to perform a rare festival performance at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] event that he curated in March 2012 in [[Minehead]], England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php |title=ATP curated by Jeff Mangum |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=2012-02-23}}</ref>

The band released its tenth full-length album, ''[[Love at the Bottom of the Sea]]'', on March 6, 2012. This album, sometimes compared to ''69 Love Songs''{{by whom?|date=October 2021}}, brought back the use of synthesizers. Merritt told fans on his website, "I was very happy to be using synthesizers in ways that I had not done before. Most of the synthesizers on the record didn't exist when we were last using synthesizers."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dobbins |first1=Amanda |title=Magnetic Fields Releasing a New, Synth-y Album in March |url=https://www.vulture.com/2011/12/magnetic-fields-releasing-a-new-synth-y-album-in-march.html |website=Vulture |date=December 13, 2011 |access-date=October 12, 2021}}</ref> The song "[[Andrew in Drag]]" garnered much attention, receiving play from entities such as [[CBS News]] and [[NPR]]'s ''[[All Songs Considered]]''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Raby |first1=Dan |title=The Magnetic Fields' 'Andrew in Drag' |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/allsongs/2012/02/02/146241663/first-watch-the-magnetic-fields-andrew-in-drag |website=NPRmusic |date=February 2, 2012}}</ref> In 2012, the Magnetic Fields celebrated its new album by launching a North American and European tour. It began on March 6, the release date of ''Love at the Bottom of the Sea'', and continued for two months.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nonesuch.com/journal/magnetic-fields-50-song-memoir-composer-stephin-merritt-march-3-2016-11-17 |title=The Magnetic Fields' "50 Song Memoir," a Musical Exploration of Composer Stephin Merritt's Life, Due March 10 on Nonesuch |website=Nonesuch.com |access-date=2020-05-29}}</ref>

In 2016, it was announced that the band's eleventh studio album, ''[[50 Song Memoir]]'', would contain fifty songs, akin to the ''69 Love Songs'' concept, one to commemorate each year since Stephin Merritt was born. It was released in March 2017.

On May 15, 2020, the band digitally released the album ''[[Quickies]]''—twenty-eight songs under three minutes long—through [[Nonesuch Records]]. The first single, "The Day the Politicians Died", was released on February 25, followed by "[[Kraftwerk]] in a Blackout" on April 1, "I Want to Join a Biker Gang" on April 16, and "I've Got a Date With Jesus" on May 8. The band released a vinyl box set of the album on May 29, followed by the CD on June 16.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Magnetic Fields' "Quickies" Vinyl Box Set Now Available |url=https://www.nonesuch.com/journal/magnetic-fields-quickies-vinyl-box-set-now-available-2020-05-29 |website=Nonesuch Records}}</ref> Former lead singer Susan Anway died in September 2021.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Helman |first1=Peter |title=The Magnetic Fields’ first singer Susan Anway has died |url=https://www.stereogum.com/2160167/the-magnetic-fields-first-singer-susan-anway-has-died/news/ |website=Stereogum |access-date=9 September 2021 |language=en |date=9 September 2021}}</ref>
