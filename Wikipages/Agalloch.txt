'''Agalloch''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|g|ə|ˌ|l|ɒ|x}}) was an American [[extreme metal]] band from [[Portland, Oregon]]. Formed in 1995 by frontman [[John Haughm]], they released five full-length albums, four EPs, two singles, one split single, two demos, four compilation albums and one live video album. They announced their disbandment in May 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2016/07/28/487744994/songs-we-love-agalloch-in-the-shadow-of-our-pale-companion|title=Songs We Love: Agalloch, 'In The Shadow Of Our Pale Companion'}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years (1995–1997)===

Named after the [[resinous]] wood of the [[agarwood]] (Aquilaria agallocha), Agalloch began as the creation of Haughm and keyboardist Shane Breyer. In early 1996, the duo began composing material. Guitarist Don Anderson joined the band that summer to further refine the songs, which were recorded that autumn for release as the band's first [[demo tape]], From Which of This Oak. This recording displayed a significant [[black metal]] influence and included material which would later appear on subsequent albums in one form or another. Shortly after the recording, bassist Jason William Walton was added to the lineup.

===''Pale Folklore'' and ''Of Stone, Wind, and Pillor'' (1998–2001)===
In 1998, the trio recorded a new demo tape, ''Promo 1998'', solely for labels. It caught the attention of [[The End Records]], who offered them a contract, resulting in the 1999 release of their debut full-length album, ''[[Pale Folklore]]''. Reworking several earlier demo tracks, the album featured less of a black metal influence, more [[folk music|neofolk]] elements and [[Neoclassicism (music)|neoclassical]] interludes. After the recording was completed, Breyer departed the band due to a lack of interest in music.

After a hiatus, the band released an [[Extended play|EP]] of unreleased material from 1998–2001 titled ''[[Of Stone, Wind, and Pillor]]'', revealing more neoclassical and experimental elements. The EP also included a cover of "Kneel to the Cross" by neofolk band [[Sol Invictus (band)|Sol Invictus]] that would later be released on ''Sol Lucet Omnibus'', French label Cynerfierrd's tribute compilation to Sol Invictus.

===''The Mantle'' (2002–2005)===
During the 2001 to early 2002 period, Agalloch recorded ''[[The Mantle]]'', featuring more of a [[post-rock]] influence. The album's sleeve art featured photographs of public statues and fountains found in downtown [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. This album marked a change in media attention for Agalloch, landing them interviews with mainstream magazines.

Following the release of ''The Mantle'', Agalloch played their first show on March 6, 2003 in Portland,<ref>[http://www.metal-rules.com/concerts/agalloch.htm Agalloch / Nothing Concert Review]. Metal-rules.com. Retrieved December 14, 2005.</ref> followed by a few additional shows in March and a US West Coast tour in May.

Two subsequent records, the ''[[Tomorrow Will Never Come]]'' 7" single (issued by The End's Infinite Vinyl Series in 2003) and ''[[The Grey (Agalloch EP)|The Grey]]'' (released by [[Vendlus Records]] in 2004), showcased an even more experimental side of Agalloch, featuring remixed and reworked versions of songs from ''The Mantle'' as well as a new post-rock-influenced title track on the [[B-side]] of ''Tomorrow Will Never Come''. Agalloch performed a series of shows on the North American East Coast in 2004.

A nature-themed split 10" picture disc single with the Finnish band [[Nest (band)|Nest]] was also released in 2004, showcasing a collaborative, neofolk effort by Agalloch on the [[A-side]]. The Nest track, a more electronic, percussion-heavy effort, included vocal and guitar contributions by Haughm and Anderson.

Double [[gramophone record|vinyl]] reissues of ''The Mantle'' and ''Pale Folklore'' were released in 2005 in limited wooden boxes, complete with new artwork for both albums, to commemorate the band's single live performance of 2005 at the Day of the Equinox music festival held in [[Toronto]] on October 14, 2005.

===''Ashes Against the Grain'' and ''The White'' (2006–2008)===
''[[Ashes Against the Grain]]'', the band's third full-length album, was released on August 8, 2006 by The End Records, featuring less focus on ''[[The Mantle]]'''s prominent [[acoustic guitar]]s and more emphasis on [[electric guitar]]s and metal elements, giving the album a different sound than their previous releases.

On previous albums, Haughm had played drums, but wished to concentrate more on songwriting and guitar, so Chris Greene (who had joined the band for live shows beginning in 2003) played drums on all ''Ashes Against the Grain'' tracks except "Falling Snow" and "Not Unlike the Waves." After a 2006 European tour, Greene exited the band, replaced by [[Aesop Dekker]] of [[Ludicra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehereticstorch.blogspot.com/2011/01/against-grain-john-haughm-of-agalloch.html|title=Against the Grain: John Haughm of Agalloch|last=M|date=January 21, 2011}}</ref>

''Ashes Against the Grain'' completed the band's contract with The End Records, and in April 2008, Agalloch decided against renewing the contract.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120909024442/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=95551 Agalloch Parts Ways with The End Records].

On February 29, 2008, Agalloch released ''[[The White (Agalloch EP)|The White]]'', the second half (and stylistic opposite) of their two-part EP release for Vendlus. As with ''The Grey'', the album was limited to 2,000 copies. ''The White'' collected dark folk/ambient work from 2004–2007, with a sound more akin to the acoustic guitar approach of ''The Mantle''. The tracks "The Isle of Summer", "Sowilo Rune" and "Summerisle Reprise" were based on themes from the 1973 film ''[[The Wicker Man (1973 film)|The Wicker Man]]'', with all three tracks utilizing samples from the film. The track "Birch White" borrowed its lyrics from a song by [[A.S.J. Tessimond]] titled "Birch Tree". "Sowilo Rune" was posted on Agalloch's official [[MySpace]] page roughly two months before the album was released.

===''The Demonstration Archive'' and ''Marrow of the Spirit'' (2008–2013)===
On August 4, 2008, Agalloch released a compilation album called ''[[The Demonstration Archive|The Demonstration Archive 1996–1998]]'' on Licht von Dämmerung Arthouse, collecting material recorded between 1996 and 1998 including the ''From Which of This Oak'' and ''Promo 1998'' demos and the then-unreleased ''[[Of Stone, Wind, and Pillor]]'' EP.

On August 12, 2009, ''From Which of This Oak'' was re-released as a [[LP album|picture disk]] by German label Eisenwald Tonschmiede.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120707142252/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=107874267&blogId=505388301 Agalloch 12"Pic-LP & Gorath 12"LP+7"].

Agalloch recorded a track, "Nebelmeer", with German artist Mathias Grassow for the compilation album ''[[Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer]]'' (English: "[[Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog]]") released by Pest Productions in March 2010.<ref>[https://archive.today/20120712200435/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=396676444&blogId=481438843 Der Wanderer über dem Nebelmeer – Final tracklist & update].

A two-CD compilation album named ''[[The Compendium Archive|The Compendium Archive 1996 – 2006]]'' was released by Licht von Dämmerung Arthouse on March 20, 2010, limited to 250 copies. The album was intended to be sold exclusively at two shows played by the band in Romania during March 2010; however, 85 unsold copies were subsequently sold on [[eBay]] by the band during May 2010. Disc one was an exact copy of ''The Demonstration Archive'', while disc two contained material recorded during the 2000–2006 period and previously released on ''Of Stone, Wind, and Pillor'', ''Tomorrow Will Never Come'' and the split with Nest, as well as alternate versions of tracks from ''The Mantle'' and ''Ashes Against the Grain'' and some previously unreleased tracks.

On June 7, 2010, Agalloch posted a blog entry on MySpace stating that the fourth album would be released on the Canadian record label [[Profound Lore Records]], which had also released the first two Agalloch albums on vinyl in 2005. The band stated that the album would be recorded throughout June and July 2010 but did not list the album's title or release date.<ref>[http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=27545777&blogId=535486102 Profound Lore to release 4th Agalloch album…] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618131731/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=27545777&blogId=535486102 |date=June 18, 2010 }} Myspace.com.

In an interview with ''[[Exclaim!]]'' magazine, in regards to the production of ''Marrow of the Spirit'', Haughm stated, “We wanted an album that sounded more alive and real....Our last album was a bit too mechanized, too polished, and that kind of disturbed us. So we brought back the older methods that we had utilized on our demos and first album to try and get back a more organic feeling.”<ref>[http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/agalloch Exclaim! magazine interview with Jon Haughm of Agalloch].

A tour-only edition of ''Marrow of the Spirit'' was issued by Licht von Dämmerung/Profound Lore, including a CD, photo cards and a bonus 7" featuring two tracks: "Nihil Totem" and "The Weight of Darkness".

On June 26, 2012, Agalloch released the ''[[Faustian Echoes]]'' EP on Licht von Dämmerung Arthouse, consisting of just one 21-minute-long song (the longest song Agalloch has ever written). Agalloch toured North America in July and August 2012 to support the release.<ref>[http://www.earsplitcompound.com/site/2012/06/26/agalloch-faustian-echoes-ep-streaming-in-its-entirety-north-american-tour-draws-near/ AGALLOCH: Faustian Echoes EP Streaming In Its Entirety; North American Tour Draws Near] earsplitcompound.com. 06-26-2012.

Common themes in Agalloch's imagery and subject matter were the beauty of nature, winter, melancholy and allusions to ancestral [[paganism]]. Don Anderson described [[Norse mythology]] as a major influence on the band and said that "heathen culture" was the main inspiration for frontman [[John Haughm]] in particular. Anderson said that the band's take on [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s philosophy could be viewed as a kind of worship of nature, but that no one in the band practiced paganism as a religion.<ref>Edoardo Baldini.

Agalloch also used non-traditional instruments, such as a [[deer]] skull. In the song "The Lodge", Haughm struck the deer skull to create an unusual clicking sound.<ref>{{cite web |author=Martinelli, Roberto |title=Interview with Jason Walton of Agalloch |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss14_18.php |publisher=Maelstrom.nu |access-date=March 25, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107151403/http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss14_18.php |archive-date=November 7, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
