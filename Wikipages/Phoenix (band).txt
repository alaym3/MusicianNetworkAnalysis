==History==

===Formation and early years===
Phoenix was conceived in the 1990s when vocalist [[Thomas Mars]], bassist Deck d'Arcy, and guitarist Chris Mazzalai, who were all friends in school, started playing together as a "[[Garage rock|garage band]]" based out of Mars's house in the suburbs of Paris. In 1995, Laurent Brancowitz, Mazzalai's older brother, permanently joined the band on guitar after the end of [[Darlin' (French band)|Darlin']], a short-lived band that Brancowitz had formed with [[Thomas Bangalter]] and [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]], who would later form electronic duo [[Daft Punk]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Daft Punk's Electroma (2006)|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/350447/Daft-Punk-s-Electroma/overview|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115171217/http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/350447/Daft-Punk-s-Electroma/overview|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 November 2007|access-date=24 September 2012|department=Movies & TV Dept.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=2007|author=Nathan Southern}}</ref> Two years later the band took on the name Phoenix and pressed 500 copies of a single on their own label, Ghettoblaster. Shortly after, they were signed to the Paris-based Source Records. Phoenix quickly became well acquainted with labelmates [[Air (French band)|Air]] when they acted as their backing band on several UK TV appearances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix|url=http://music.aol.com/artist/phoenix/biography|work=Aol Music.|publisher=AOL Inc|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Aol Music.|year=2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407014304/http://music.aol.com/artist/phoenix/biography|archive-date=7 April 2012}}</ref>

===''United'', ''Alphabetical'', and ''Live! Thirty Days Ago'' (2000–2004)===
Phoenix began releasing singles in 1999, the first of these being "Heatwave" and "Party Time", the latter of which would eventually appear on their debut album, ''United''. The single "Too Young" was released on 22 May 2000, along with remixes of the track by [[Zoot Woman]] and [[Le Knight Club]]. "Too Young" was the band's first single to chart, reaching No. 97 in France and No. 148 in the UK. The band's debut album, ''[[United (Phoenix album)|United]]'', was released on 12 June 2000. It featured the singles "Party Time" and "Too Young", with "If I Ever Feel Better" being announced as the third single from the album on 22 January 2001, and charting in several countries, reaching No. 12 in France and No. 4 in Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/if-i-ever-feel-better-single/id697640597|title=If I Ever Feel Better - Single by Phoenix on Apple Music|website=iTunes|access-date=2017-07-14}}</ref> ''United'' received positive reviews, although the band did not reach mainstream success. "Too Young" was included on the [[Lost in Translation (soundtrack)|soundtrack]] for the movie ''[[Lost in Translation (film)|Lost in Translation]]'' (which was directed by Mars' future wife, [[Sofia Coppola]]), as well as in the movie ''[[Shallow Hal]]''.

Shortly after the release of ''United'', Phoenix began work on a second album, recording in 2003 and 2004 and releasing the singles "Run Run Run" and "[[Everything Is Everything (Phoenix song)|Everything Is Everything]]" in 2004. The band's second album, ''[[Alphabetical (album)|Alphabetical]]'', was released on 22 March 2004 and saw the band reach more mainstream success, with both singles reaching some alternative rock airplay charts.{{which|date=March 2012}} French fashion designer [[Hedi Slimane]] commissioned a special mix of their song "Victim of the Crime", taken from ''Alphabetical'', as the soundtrack to one of his runway shows for menswear clothing retailer [[Dior Homme]].

Following ''Alphabetical'', the band toured three continents, playing 150 dates. This tour was followed up with a live album, ''[[Live! Thirty Days Ago]]'', released only thirty days after the end of the tour.

===''It's Never Been Like That'' and ''Kitsuné Tabloid'' (2005–2009)===
After their ''Alphabetical'' tour, Phoenix spent time in Berlin during the summer of 2005, making use of Planet Roc studios to produce their third album. On 8 May 2006, the band released the lead single from the album, titled "Long Distance Call". American band [[Paramore]] would go on to perform a cover of the song live on ''[[Taratata]]'', a French TV show. Phoenix's third studio album, titled ''[[It's Never Been Like That]]'', was released on 15 May 2006. To promote the release of the album, Phoenix toured the United States and Europe in 2006. The album charted in several countries, reaching even greater success than ''Alphabetical'', although it still did not chart in much of North America. ''It's Never Been Like That'' was re-released in Mexico later that year, with the so-called "tour edition" featuring four bonus tracks recorded live in Oslo from the tour. On 11 September 2006, the track "Consolation Prizes" was announced to be the second single from ''It's Never Been Like That''.

Phoenix curated a compilation album for French electronic music record and fashion label [[Kitsuné]]. It was released on 23 March 2009, and includes music by [[Elvis Costello]], [[Roxy Music]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Lou Reed]] and others.

===''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix'' (2009–2011)===
In early 2009, around the time of the release of the Phoenix's compilation album for [[Kitsuné]], it was announced that the band would be returning with a new album titled ''[[Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix]]'', which would be released on 25 May 2009.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6328608.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Homemade Lisztomania YouTube video brings Phoenix fans | first=Tim | last=Cooper | date=2009-05-24 | access-date=2010-05-22}}</ref> The album was recorded in Paris, and was co-produced and mixed by Philippe Zdar of [[Cassius (band)|Cassius]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/67252/phoenix|title=Phoenix Rises With New Album, Label|access-date=2009-03-04|date=2009-02-27|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref> "[[1901 (song)|1901]]", a tribute to early Paris, was released on 23 February 2009 on the band's website as a free download. Due to extremely positive reviews, the song was then issued as a retail single and aired for the first time on Australian radio station [[Triple J]]. In June 2009, after the release of the album, Phoenix first appeared on the cover of the 62nd issue of ''The FADER'' publication.<ref>{{cite news | title = We Party (And Make Magazines) | publisher = The FADER | date = 2009-06-16 | url = http://www.thefader.com/2009/06/16/we-party-and-make-magazines/ | access-date =13 November 2013}}</ref> As the album's popularity rapidly grew, "[[Lisztomania (song)|Lisztomania]]" and "Lasso" were issued as the second and third singles from ''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix''.

As it became apparent that "1901" was Phoenix's biggest success yet, the song was performed live on several TV shows and began to appear everywhere. "1901" was featured in the US during [[Super Bowl XLV]] in a [[Green Bay Packers]] montage, and was also performed on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' along with "Too Young" and "Lisztomania" on April 4.<ref>Phoenix Live performing Saturday Night in New York [http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x8w56f_phoenix-live-saturday-night_music video]</ref> Phoenix also performed "Lisztomania" on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix on Jimmy Fallon|url=http://jp917v2.blogspot.com/2009/09/phoenix-on-jimmy-fallon.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121216052055/http://jp917v2.blogspot.com/2009/09/phoenix-on-jimmy-fallon.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=16 December 2012|work=JP's Blog|publisher=Google|access-date=8 June 2012|author=JP|format=Blog|date=25 September 2009}}</ref> "Girlfriend" on ''[[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix – Girlfriend (The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVNHZlR0kLg|work=YouTube|publisher=Google|access-date=8 June 2012|author=kocia43|format=Video file|date=4 January 2011}}</ref> and "1901" on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'',<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix - 1901 (Live on Letterman) 18 Juin 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulP4OXxFbM|work=YouTube|publisher=Google|access-date=8 June 2012|author=BadGones3169|date=22 June 2009}}</ref> ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix 1901 Jimmy Kimmel (TV VERSION) HD|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erm9dHTEWqk|work=YouTube|publisher=Google|access-date=8 June 2012|author=MrRendezvous101|date=10 February 2011}}</ref> and ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix Performs "1901" on The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|url=http://jetcomx.com/2009/09/16/phoenix-performs-1901-on-the-tonight-show-with-conan-obrien/|work=Jetcomx|publisher=Jetcomx|access-date=8 June 2012|author=ANDREW BONI|date=16 September 2009}}</ref>

''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix'' won [[Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Music Album]] at the [[52nd Grammy Awards|2009 Grammy Awards]] on 31 January 2010. Shortly afterwards, "1901" hit No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Airplay|Alternative Songs]] chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Beat Wednesday: Phoenix, Black Eyed Peas, Kutless|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/959439/chart-beat-wednesday-phoenix-black-eyed-peas-kutless|work=Billboard|publisher=Billboard|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Gary Trust|date=10 February 2010}}</ref> The album was the first Phoenix album to be certified gold and appeared on numerous "Best of" lists at the end of 2010, including ''Rolling Stone'' magazine.<ref name="John" /> In addition, "1901" and "Lisztomania" were certified platinum and gold, respectively.

Following the album's release, Phoenix appeared at various major music festivals, including the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] in [[Texas]] in 2009, [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella Music Festival]] in [[Indio, California]] in 2010, the [[2010 Bonnaroo Music Festival]] in [[Manchester, Tennessee]], the [[Southside Festival]] and [[Hurricane Festival]] in [[Germany]], the 2010 [[Lollapalooza]], the [[Mile High Music Festival]], [[Outside Lands Music and Arts Festival]] in [[San Francisco, California]], [[Rock Werchter]] 2010 in [[Belgium]], and the 2010 [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. On 20 October 2010, French electronic music group [[Daft Punk]], composing of guitarist Christian Mazzalai's childhood friends [[Thomas Bangalter]] and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, made a special appearance for their show in [[Madison Square Garden]].

[[AllMusic]], a review website, commented favourably on the release of the album. "Beyond containing the band's best, most efficient songwriting, the album also stands apart from the first three studio albums by projecting a cool punch that is unforced," a reviewer commented.<ref>[{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1552917|pure_url=yes}} Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix – Phoenix | AllMusic<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Vocalist [[Thomas Mars]], described as "more bright-eyed and youthful than ever", is more prominent in these songs, harmonising with the instruments. "Maybe they've just hit their stride," the reviewer said.

Phoenix are the subject of a documentary ''From a Mess to the Masses'' that documents their 2009&ndash;10 tour in support of ''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix''. The film was directed by Antoine Wagner and Francisco Soriano—Wagner was also responsible for directing the "Lisztomania" music video. The title of the documentary is a lyrical excerpt from "Lisztomania" and the total running time is 52 minutes. ''From a Mess to the Masses'' premiered in Germany and France on the Arte television network on 13 October 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix Readies 'A Mess to the Masses' Documentary: Watch|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466301/phoenix-readies-a-mess-to-the-masses-documentary-watch|work=Billboard|publisher=Billboard|access-date=21 May 2013|author=David Greenwald|date=10 October 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix Documentary 'From a Mess to the Masses'|url=http://www.twentyfourbit.com/2011/10/trailer-phoenix-documentary-from-a-mess-to-the/|work=TwentyFourBit|publisher=TwentyFourBit|access-date=21 May 2013|date=9 October 2011}}</ref>

===''Bankrupt!'' (2011–2015)===
On 5 April 2011, the band posted a blog update on their website entitled "Songwriting..." that revealed [[Closed-circuit television|CCTV]] stills of a studio in which the band was working.<ref>{{cite web|title=Songwriting… |url= http://wearephoenix.com/journal/?p=4018%7C |work= Phoenix Diary |access-date= 30 July 2012 |date= 5 April 2011 }}</ref> The band stated in interviews that the album would be a departure from the pop sounds of ''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix'', and they were trying to create something more experimental. That same year, vocalist [[Thomas Mars]] married American screenwriter and director [[Sofia Coppola]], whom he had met while producing the soundtrack to ''[[The Virgin Suicides (film)|The Virgin Suicides]]'' in 1999.

On 16 January 2012, the band revealed that they had completed four songs for the fifth album and it was scheduled for a late summer 2012 release, with an autumn tour. Daniel Glass, the founder of [[Glassnote Records]], stated in relation to the material, "It's very hard to beat ''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix'', but this could be revolutionary."<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix: 2012 Album Preview|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/review/1067236/phoenix-2012-album-preview|work=Billboard.com|publisher=Rovi Corporation|access-date=30 July 2012|author=Billboard.com|date=16 January 2012}}</ref> The band then updated its webpage to display the cryptic words ''[[Pluviôse]]'' (until the end of March 2012), ''[[Thermidor]]'' (from April 2012) and ''[[Vendémiaire]]'' (from September 2012)—the words replaced the CCTV still that was published in October 2011. ''Pluviôse'', ''Thermidor'' and ''Vendémiaire'' are three of the months of the [[French Republican Calendar]] (also known as the Revolutionary Calendar<ref>{{cite web|title=The Revolutionary Calendar|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/c_revcalendar.html|work=Research Subjects: Government & Politics (The Republican Series)|publisher=The Napoleon Series|access-date=12 February 2013|language= fr|year=1995–2002}}</ref>). Although the band had previously announced that a new album would be released in late summer 2012, no announcement was made about the album's release.

On 16 January 2013, exactly one year after the announcement that the band had completed four songs for the album, ''[[Bankrupt!]]'' was revealed as the title of the fifth album and a teaser was released on the Phoenix website.<ref>{{cite web|title=Phoenix Announce New Album Title|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/49188-phoenix-post-mysterious-teaser/|work=Pitchfork|publisher=Pitchfork Media Inc|access-date=12 February 2013|author=Amy Phillips|date=16 January 2013}}</ref> On 12 February 2013, a redesigned Phoenix website further promoted the ''Bankrupt!'' album, with an official release date of 22 April 2013, published on the website's opening page that features an animated writing sequence. A message from the band is written by an invisible hand, while music plays and states, mostly in English, with some French: "Dear all, our new album, Bankrupt!, will be released the week of April 22nd. Here [the word "Here" is a link to the website page that reveals both the album cover art and the track listing] is the track listing as well as the album cover.

On 22 April 2013, Phoenix played a rare London show at [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] on the day that ''Bankrupt!'' was released. Mars entered the crowd and sang while immersed in the audience for a large portion of the show; he then climbed up cables to the first-level balcony and "crowd-surfed" his way back to the stage. In a review of the performance, music writer Josh Holliday declared: "And along with peace, love and understanding, what the world needs now is a band we can all believe in as one. That band is Phoenix."<ref name="Josh">{{cite web|title=From the Flames.

In media articles on ''Bankrupt!'' after the album's release, Mars provided insight into the circumstances that influenced the creation of the band's fifth album: "At that time, we started talking about success and not music. I guess it was time to protect ourselves and focus on music again." Mars made reference to the period of intensive public attention that occurred in the wake of the Grammy Award-winning ''Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix'', Phoenix's first record to achieve gold certification. Mars also reflected on the benefits of the band's belated success: "We're lucky that we didn't have a hit single for a while, so when we play live, people are not expecting just one song, and we don't tour as a greatest hits band, which can be sad, I'm sure." In a more general sense, Mars also emphasized the importance of the live setting for Phoenix and its relationship to studio work: "I guess we're perfectionists in the way that when we make an album, we know it's going to last. It's important that it's exactly how we want it to be. But when the record is done, it's all about imperfection. It's all about playing live."<ref name="John">{{cite web|title=Phoenix gets back on track with 'Bankrupt!'|url=http://www.journalgazette.net/article/20130521/ENT02/305219999/1011/FEAT|work=Journal Gazette|agency=Associated Press|access-date=21 May 2013|author=John Carucci|date=21 May 2013}}</ref> Phoenix also used the Harrison 4032 solid-state recording console, the same console used on [[Michael Jackson]]'s ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', to mix ''Bankrupt!''. The console was purchased on eBay and shipped to Paris. ''Bankrupt!'' debuted at number 4 on the American ''Billboard'' 200 albums chart and a Phoenix world tour was completed over a large part of 2013.

Phoenix appeared in the 2015 [[Netflix]] special ''[[A Very Murray Christmas]]'', directed by Mars' wife [[Sofia Coppola]]. The group performed a cover of [[The Beach Boys]]' "[[Alone on Christmas Day]]", with [[Bill Murray]] providing backing vocals.

===''Ti Amo'' (2016–present)===
In November 2016, Phoenix mysteriously changed their social media themes to a [[Test card|television holding screen image]]. They also announced a series of festival appearances in Spain and France. On 4 January 2017, it was announced that they would be in a headlining spot at [[Governors Ball Music Festival|Governors Ball]] in [[New York City]] the first weekend of June, which would be their first show since 2014. In March they announced to be playing two warm-up shows on April 22 and 23 in Antwerp, Belgium.

On 1 March 2017, Phoenix again updated social media, teasing new music with a 30-second clip, and announcing multiple tour dates. By 24 April 2017, the band had announced that their sixth album, ''[[Ti Amo (album)|Ti Amo]]'', would be released on 9 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|last=Yoo|first=Noah|title=Phoenix Announce New Album Ti Amo {{!}} Pitchfork|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/69941-phoenix-announce-new-album-ti-amo/|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=27 April 2017|language=en}}</ref> Three days later, on 27 April 2017, the band released the album's first single, "[[J-Boy]]" (an acronym for "Just Because of You").<ref>{{cite web|last1=Minsker|first1=Evan|last2=Wicks|first2=Amanda|title=Phoenix Share New Song "J-Boy," Detail New Album Ti Amo: Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/55350-phoenix-share-new-song-j-boy-detail-new-album-ti-amo-listen/|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=27 April 2017}}</ref> This was followed by the release of the title track, "Ti Amo", on 18 May 2017<ref>{{cite web|last=Fu|first=Eddie|title=Phoenix unveil new song "Ti Amo" — listen|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/05/phoenix-unveil-new-song-ti-amo-listen/|work= Consequence of Sound|date=18 May 2017|access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> and the single "Goodbye Soleil" on 2 June 2017, a week before the album's release.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1944460/phoenix-goodbye-soleil/music/|title=Phoenix – 'Goodbye Soleil'|date=2017-06-01|work=Stereogum|access-date=2017-06-06}}</ref> Phoenix toured worldwide to promote the release of ''Ti Amo''.

The band performed residency shows in Paris, New York City, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Mexico City titled, "A Very Speciale Night with Phoenix". It featured exclusive merchandise, Phoenix vending machine, gelato (food selection varied at shows), discoteca after party, live music, special guests, and Phoenix sake.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BeTXIVBHaRh/|title=Phoenix on Instagram: "NYC!!!

In July 2020 during a Pitchfork live stream on YouTube which re-played their 2017 Accorhotels Arena concert in Paris, the band members gave commentary to the performance as well as replied to various fan comments. The band teased that new music will be released soon, with a song already on the horizon a few weeks away.

=== Phoenix Sake Collection   ===
In 2017, Phoenix collaborated with Tatenokawa, Inc., a brewery from [[Yamagata Prefecture]], Japan, as a tribute for their late friend Toshiro Kuroda, a Japanese restaurateur who ran a store in Paris called Workshop Isse which offered food and [[sake]] from Japan. This store was on the ground floor of Christian Mazzalai's apartment building, which is how he became friends with Kuroda. During the band's Japan tour while promoting ''Bankrupt!'', Kuroda took the band to visit sake breweries in Japan, one of which was Tatenokawa, Inc.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2019/05/11/food/phoenix-sake-collection-tribute-music-n-sake/|title=Phoenix Sake Collection: A tribute to music 'n' sake|last=Joe|first=Melinda|date=2019-05-11|work=The Japan Times Online|access-date=2019-07-10|language=en-US|issn=0447-5763}}</ref>

Phoenix and Tatenokawa, Inc. created Phoenix Sake Collection, which features Tatenokawa Phoenix (also referred to as Rainbow Label) and Sparkling sake. The Sparking sake was created to commemorate the band's 20th anniversary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tatenokawa.jp/en/sake/phoenix/|title=Japanese sake "TATENOKAWA" {{!}} Phoenix Sake Collection|website=www.tatenokawa.jp|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>

The collection also featured limited-edition brews: Tatenokawa Junmai Daiginjo, Kaze no Mori Junmai Daiginjo (from Nara Prefecture), and Sohomare Junmai Ginjo (from Tochigi Prefecture). The bottles were wrapped in a hand-dyed washcloth featuring illustrations of the band and sake logo. A portion of the sales were donated to the Japanese Red Cross.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tatenokawa.jp/ja/sake/news/index.html?id=1554706084&mode=news|title=日本酒「楯野川」 {{!}} ニュースリリース|website=日本酒「楯野川」|language=ja|access-date=2019-07-10}}</ref>
