'''Edwyn Stephen Collins''' (born 23 August 1959) is a Scottish musician, producer and record label owner from [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. Collins was the lead singer for the 1980s [[post-punk]] band [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]], which he co-founded. After the group split in 1985, Collins started a solo career. His 1995 single "[[A Girl Like You (Edwyn Collins song)|A Girl Like You]]" was a worldwide hit.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last=Ankeny |first=Jason |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p45120/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title= Biography |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=26 July 2009}}</ref>

In February 2005, Collins was hospitalised after two cerebral haemorrhages which resulted in [[aphasia]], and he needed months to recover.<ref name= "docguard">{{cite web| last1= Ferguson| first1= Euan|title=Edwyn Collins: 'I couldn't really talk.

Collins was the co-founder of the indie record label [[Postcard Records]] and co-founded a second label, Analogue Enhanced Digital, in 2011. Collins has also worked as an illustrator, television actor, television producer and record producer. He won an [[Ivor Novello Award]], the Ivor Inspiration Award, in 2009.<ref name= "ivor">{{cite web| last1= Swash |first1= Rosie|title=Double triumph for Elbow at Ivor Novello Awards| url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/21/elbow-triumph-ivor-novello-awards|website=The Guardian|access-date=3 August 2016|date=21 May 2009}}</ref>

==Early life==
Collins was born in [[Edinburgh]]. He lived in [[Dundee]] from the age of six to 14 after his father got a job as a lecturer at [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art and Design]]. He attended the now-defunct Demonstration School in Park Place, where new educational ideas were tried out by students and teachers from the adjacent teacher training college, before moving to the secondary school, [[Morgan Academy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecourier.co.uk/fp/lifestyle/entertainment/music/rocktalk/965348/interview-strokes-left-me-so-vulnerable-says-music-star-edwyn-collins-ahead-of-dundee-homecoming-concert/|title=FEATURE: 'Strokes left me so vulnerable,' says Dundee-raised music star Edwyn Collins ahead of homecoming concert|website=Thecourier.co.uk|access-date=3 December 2019}}</ref>

==Career==
===Orange Juice===
{{main|Orange Juice (band)}}
Collins co-founded the band the Nu-Sonics in 1976 in the [[Glasgow]] suburb of [[Bearsden]]. The band changed its name to [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]] in 1979. Collins and his friend Alan Horne founded the record label [[Postcard Records]] that year to release the band's singles.<ref>{{cite web |title=Show 507 – Edwyn Collins Feature |url=https://soundcloud.com/britishcouncil/edwyn-collins-feature |website=SoundCloud |access-date=3 July 2014 |year=2011}}</ref> The band's debut single, "[[Falling and Laughing]]" was issued in February 1980. Although critically acclaimed, the single only sold 2,000 copies.<ref name="uncut">{{cite web| last1=McKay| first1=Alastair|title=Orange Juice: "If anything became too smooth, Edwyn Collins liked to fuck it up" - Uncut| url= http://www.uncut.co.uk/features/orange-juice-if-anything-became-too-smooth-edwyn-collins-liked-to-fuck-it-up-7627| website=Uncut|access-date=3 August 2016|date=20 June 2014}}</ref>

After three more singles with Postcard, Orange Juice signed to [[Polydor Records]] in October 1981 and released their debut album, ''[[You Can't Hide Your Love Forever]]'', in March 1982.<ref name= "uncut"/> The band's second album, ''[[Rip It Up (Orange Juice album)|Rip It Up]]'' followed in November 1982. Their single "[[Rip It Up (Orange Juice song)|Rip It Up]]", released in early 1983, reached number 8 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was noted as the first British hit single to feature a bass-line from the [[Roland TB-303]] synthesizer.<ref>{{cite magazine| url= http://www.stylusmagazine.com/articles/seconds/buzzcocks-boredom-orange-juice-rip-it-up.htm |title=Buzzcocks: Boredom / Orange Juice: Rip It Up - Seconds |magazine=Stylus Magazine |access-date=7 September 2015}}</ref> The song was their only Top 40 single.<ref>{{cite web|title=ORANGE JUICE {{!}} full Official Chart History | publisher= Official Charts Company| url= http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/19352/orange-juice/| website= officialcharts.com}}</ref>

The band's two subsequent albums, ''[[Texas Fever]]'' and ''[[The Orange Juice]]'', were both released in 1984. They failed to find the same success as ''Rip It Up''.<ref name="uncut"/>

Orange Juice disbanded in January 1985, after Polydor grew dissatisfied with the band's lack of success and the band's difficulty finding a new label to sign with.<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="uncut"/> During this time in his career, Collins met Grace Maxwell, whom he hired as his manager and later married.<ref name= "uncut"/>

Collins started his solo career in 1986, and signed to [[Elevation Records]], a label that was co-venture between indie label [[Creation Records]] and major label [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music]].<ref name="AMG"/>

===Solo career to 2005===
Collins released two singles for the Elevation label in 1987, both produced by [[Robin Guthrie]] of the [[Cocteau Twins]], but both failed to enter the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Elevation was closed in November 1987, just ten months after it released its first single. After the closure, Collins experienced a "falling out" with [[Creation Records]] founder [[Alan McGee]], who had financed Elevation.<ref name="Bio">{{cite web| title= Biography |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/edwyn-collins/id3478219|website=iTunes Preview|publisher=Apple Inc|access-date= 3 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref> As a result, unlike other Elevation signees such as [[Primal Scream]] and [[The Weather Prophets]], Collins was not migrated to the main Creation label and he was left without a record label contract.<ref name= "Bio"/>

At the request of passionate Orange Juice fans in Germany, Collins recorded his next album at a small German studio, with the aid of producer Dennis Bovell, who had worked with Collins in Orange Juice, and [[Roddy Frame]] of [[Aztec Camera]]. The album, ''[[Hope and Despair]]'', was released in 1989 by the Demon label and achieved success as an independent release. Demon also released Collins's next record, ''[[Hellbent on Compromise]]'' (1990), which was not as successful as its predecessor. Demon and Collins then parted ways and Collins embarked on a lengthy hiatus.<ref name="Bio" />

Collins built his own recording studio in 1994 that was used to record his third solo album, ''[[Gorgeous George (album)|Gorgeous George]]'', which he also produced. The studio, located in [[West Hampstead]], London, would become the West Heath Yard Studios that Collins would use for his future record label, AED Records.<ref>{{cite web| title= Edwyn Collins – Gorgeous George| url= http://www.discogs.com/Edwyn-Collins-Gorgeous-George/release/1515921 |website= Discogs.com| publisher= |access-date=3 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=AED Welcomes You|url=http://www.aedrecords.com/pages/about|website=AEDRecords.com |publisher=AED Records|access-date=3 July 2014|year=2012}}</ref>

In 1995, Collins released the single "[[A Girl Like You (Edwyn Collins song)|A Girl Like You]]", which became a hit in both the United Kingdom and United States after it was featured in the film  ''[[Empire Records]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Various – Empire Records – The Soundtrack| url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Empire-Records-The-Soundtrack/release/3187991 |website= Discogs.com |publisher=Discogs|access-date=3 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref> It was subsequently used in the movie ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' in 2003.

Collins released his followup to ''Gorgeous George'', ''[[I'm Not Following You]]'', in 1997. One of its singles, "The Magic Piper (of Love)", was featured on the soundtrack for ''[[Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery]]'' that year<ref>{{cite web| title=Various – Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery – Original Soundtrack| url=http://www.discogs.com/Various-Austin-Powers-International-Man-Of-Mystery-Original-Soundtrack/release/1482181 |website= Discogs.com |publisher=Discogs|access-date=3 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref> and was his only other Top 40 entry on the [[UK Singles Chart]] apart from "A Girl Like You."

===Cerebral haemorrhage===
In a [[BBC 6 Music]] [[radio station|radio]] interview on 18 February 2005, Collins said he felt unwell, but ascribed the [[nausea]] and [[Vertigo (medical)|vertigo]] to [[food poisoning]]. Two days later, he was admitted to [[intensive care]] in London's [[Royal Free Hospital]] after apparently suffering a major [[cerebral haemorrhage]]. After suffering a second haemorrhage he had an operation on 25 February 2005, which was followed by a lengthy programme of neurological rehabilitation owing to right-sided weakness and difficulty with speech.<ref name="resurrect"/> The [[aphasia]] he suffered allowed him to repeat only four phrases, over and over again: "yes", "no", "Grace Maxwell" (his wife's name) and "the possibilities are endless".<ref>{{cite web|last=Lewis |first=John |url= http://www.metro.co.uk/music/840674-edwyn-collins-back-with-a-vengeance |title=Edwyn Collins: Back with a vengeance | website=Metro.co.uk |date=12 September 2010 |access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref>

===Post-cerebral haemorrhage===
Collins released his sixth solo album, entitled ''[[Home Again (Edwyn Collins album)|Home Again]]'', in September 2007 on [[Heavenly Records]].<ref name="AMG"/> The album was [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] before his illness but mixed after his discharge from hospital. While still recovering, Collins returned to singing live, including playing a [[concert|gig]] at The Arts Theatre in London, UK. A tribute song celebrating his return was recorded by the [[indie pop]] band The Candy Twins.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZzN34nSYH4 |title=The Candy Twins Edwyn Collins is Back (tribute song) |website=Uk.youtube.com |date=25 February 2007 |access-date=26 July 2009}}</ref>

A [[BBC Scotland]] [[film documentary|documentary]], ''Edwyn Collins: Home Again'', narrated by [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] frontman [[Alex Kapranos]], was broadcast on 19 May 2008. Filmed during 2007, it follows Collins's progress in recovering from his illness and his first return to live performance at the BBC [[Electric Proms]].{{citation needed|date=April 2014}} Collins then performed at the [[Glastonbury Festival]], which was broadcast on 28 June 2008 on [[BBC Two]], and at [[T in the Park]] on 10 July 2009 (Collins's first ever T in the Park).<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Record @ T in the Park: Edwyn Collins & Franz Ferdinand|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=646Ng-oyYYs| publisher= scottishdailyrecord | via= YouTube| access-date=3 July 2014|format=Video upload|date=10 July 2009}}</ref>

On 2 October 2009 Collins's wife and manager Grace Maxwell detailed her "running battle" with [[Warner Music Group]] and MySpace over his right to allow fans to listen to "A Girl Like You" for free on his MySpace page.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/edwyn-collins/47628|title=Edwyn Collins' manager blasts MySpace and major labels over 'A Girl Like You' |publisher=NME |date=2 October 2009 |access-date=7 October 2009}}</ref>

In November 2009, at a gig in London's Bloomsbury Ballroom, following a tour of the Scottish Highlands, Collins's singing was contrasted with his slow speech: "[W]hen he started to sing, his baritone proved as powerful as ever."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2009/11/20/f-edwyn-collins-stroke-comeback.html |title=Musician, heal thyself |access-date=20 October 2009 | work=CBC News}}</ref> On 20 February 2010, he joined [[The Maccabees (band)|The Maccabees]] onstage at Brixton Academy for their encore, performing vocals on a rendition of "Rip It Up".

''Losing Sleep'', Collins's first written and recorded album since his 2005 illness, was then released on 13 September 2010 in the UK.<ref name="Sept">{{cite web| title=Edwyn Collins new album and download track 'Losing Sleep'| url= http://heavenlyrecordings.com/news/2010/07/edwyn-collins-new-album-download-track-losing-sleep/|website= HeavenlyRecordings.com | publisher= Heavenly Recordings|access-date=3 July 2014|date=21 July 2010|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714183734/http://heavenlyrecordings.com/news/2010/07/edwyn-collins-new-album-download-track-losing-sleep/|archive-date=14 July 2014}}</ref> The album was recorded at his own West Heath Studios between November 2008 and May 2010, and was produced by Collins and Sebastian Lewsley.  Collins and Lewsley first met in 1992, while Collins was producing former [[Subway Sect]] frontman [[Vic Godard]]'s album ''The End of the Surrey People'' and Lewsley was his assistant. For the album, he collaborated with The Cribs' Ryan Jarman and [[Johnny Marr]], Franz Ferdinand, [[The Magic Numbers]] singer Romeo Stodart, [[The Drums]] and [[Roddy Frame]].<ref name= "Sleep">{{cite web|title=Edwyn Collins| url= http://heavenlyrecordings.com/artists/edwyn-collins/| website= HeavenlyRecordings.com| publisher= Heavenly Recordings|access-date=3 July 2014|year=2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711052032/http://heavenlyrecordings.com/artists/edwyn-collins/|archive-date=11 July 2014}}</ref> Lewsley explained the recording process of ''Losing Sleep'' in 2010:
<blockquote>
We did each song in a day ... and a day consists of about four hours. So there's a real expediency about how it's recorded. The whole attitude of the album is just doing that. Not indulging anyone. Not having any band sitting round for days and days. "Have you got a guitar part yet? No? Just do it. You've got a coupla hours." They [Collins's collaborators] all looked quite petrified but they did it.<ref name= "Sleep" /></blockquote>

In 2009, during the making of ''Losing Sleep'', Lewsley observed Collins gradually regain his musical proficiency—Lewsley explained: "The studio is more of an instrument again for Edwyn."<ref name= "Sleep" /> The cover art for the album features a collection of bird drawings that Collins started working on in 2005.<ref name="Sept" />

On 30 September 2010, Collins and his band broadcast three live songs from the Royal Beacon Hotel in [[Exmouth]] for [[BBC Radio 2]]'s "[[Radcliffe and Maconie Show]]".<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00bch8n |title=BBC Radio 2 – The Radcliffe and Maconie Show, 30/09/2010, Edwyn Collins – Losing Sleep and What Is My Role | website=BBC.co.uk |date=30 September 2010 |access-date=30 March 2013}}</ref> ([[Stuart Maconie]] is a former [[music journalist]] and his first ''[[NME]]'' article was a review of Collins's 1987 gig at the Manchester International.)<ref name="Cider">{{cite book| first= Stuart| last= Maconie| year= 2004| title= Cider With Roadies| edition= 1st| publisher= Random House | location= London| isbn= 0-09-189115-9| page= 182}}</ref>

Collins's eighth solo album, ''Understated'', was released in March 2013 on his own AED Records label and was critically well received, with ''God Is in the TV'' stating:
<blockquote>
Understated is more than just another step to recovery, it is indeed a fine record in its own right, and utterly life-affirming. It's also perhaps the ultimate testament to the healing power of music. He lost the ability to read, write, and lost movement in half of his body, but what he didn't lose was his gift for coming up with an ear-catching tune, as is proved here. It will make you smile, it may even make you cry, and it's an album that reminds you how good it is to be alive.<ref>{{cite web| first=Ben P| last= Scott |url= http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2013/03/29/edwyn-collins-understated-aed-records/ |title=Review: Edwyn Collins – Understated (AED Records) |work= Godisinthetvzine.co.uk |date=29 March 2013 |access-date=24 May 2013}}</ref></blockquote>

Collins has also worked extensively as a record producer with other artists, including Terrorvision, Vic Godard,<ref name="Sleep" /> [[Robert Forster (musician)|Robert Forster]], [[The Cribs]], [[Little Barrie]], and [[Hooton Tennis Club]].

In 1999, Collins was invited by the band [[Space (English band)|Space]] to produce what would have been their third album ''[[Love You More than Football]]'', which ended up being scrapped. However he is credited as a producer on a few B-sides, and he delivers a brief vocal cameo on the song "Thank You", where he makes reference to "Falling and Laughing".

In 2005 Collins produced the Cribs album ''[[The New Fellas]]'' and co-produced the 2013 album ''Clarietta'', by Charlie Boyer and the Voyeurs, with Lewsley.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlie Boyer and the Voyeurs – Clarietta|url=http://www.discogs.com/Charlie-Boyer-And-The-Voyeurs-Clarietta/release/4617576|website=Charlie Boyer and the Voyeurs on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=3 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Cribs, The – The New Fellas|url=http://www.discogs.com/Cribs-The-New-Fellas/release/1350314|website=Cribs, The on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=3 July 2014|year=2014}}</ref> He also co-produced [[The Rails]]' debut album ''Fair Warning'', released on [[Island Records]] in 2014.<ref name="guardNew">{{cite web | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/10/the-rails-new-band-of-the-day | title=The Rails (New band of the day No 1,675 | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=10 January 2014 | access-date=23 April 2015 | last=Lester | first=Paul | author-link=Paul Lester}}</ref>
