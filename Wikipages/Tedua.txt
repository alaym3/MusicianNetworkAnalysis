== Biography ==
Tedua, pseudonym of Mario Molinari, was born in [[Genoa]]. At the age of three he was entrusted to a family, with whom the young Mario stayed for a very short span of time. He later spent a few years with his maternal grandmother in [[Milan]], before returning in his teens in the town of [[Cogoleto]], in the suburbs of Genoa, where he grew up coming into contact with those who will then be members of ''Wild Bandana''. Aged 13 Mario met Vaz Tè at school, through whom he will meet [[Izi (rapper)|Izi]]. The three, who will then be joined by other boys, will begin to devote themselves to musical activity, giving themselves soon stage names: Molinari chose ''Incubo'' (''Nightmare''), name which he later dropped in favor of ''Duate''.

== Musical style ==
The musical style of Tedua approaches essentially to the [[drill]]. From this point of view, the critics haven't been unanimous regarding the style of Tedua, expressing sometimes satisfaction, sometimes disapproval of the artistic innovation of the rapper. Drill sounds, however, respond to the flow of consciousness that underlies the music of Tedua, which is always a verbal expression of thoughts and experiences of life.

Tedua has often claimed to have been stylistically inspired by the Italian rapper [[Dargen D'Amico]], from whom he inherited the vision of music as a stream of consciousness: not surprisingly, in the ''Mowgli'' disc is contained a piece, ''Acqua (malpensandoti)'', whose refrain is a resumption of D'Amico's ''Malpensandoti''.

In addition to the Milanese rapper, Tedua's sources of inspiration include [[Chief Keef]] and [[Fedez]].
