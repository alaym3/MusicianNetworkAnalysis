== Background ==
Born and raised in Sint-Niklaas, Belgium, Woodie Smalls began rapping at an early age. In an interview he said that when he was 8 or 9, he 
used to rap all the time. He would put on a random beat and start [[freestyling]] over it. Woodie was born on the 18th of June 1996. His real name is Sylvestre Salumu. He is known for making "Planet Shrooms", as it was the song that made him viral.

== "Champion Sound" ==
With the release of his debut single and video for "Champion Sound", several Belgian radio stations, including [[Studio Brussel]] and [[MNM (radio)|MNM]], added the track to their daily rotation and FM Brussels made it their favorite track of the week. In the [[Netherlands]] Woodie was selected as one of the 2015 Encore Freshmen. The freshmen are a small group of up-and-coming talented artists handpicked by the people behind one of the biggest weekly urban party in Amsterdam.
