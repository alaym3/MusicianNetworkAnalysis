"My grandmother put me in choir when I was about seven years old. I was only in it about two or three years. Music's always been real close to my heart. Like anybody else, there were ups and downs in my life and music just always seemed to be consistent, so it was easy to latch on to. I started singing in bands when I was 16 years old. They used to kick me out of bars after my set was done."<ref name=dabelly>{{cite web|url=http://www.dabelly.com/features/feature239.htm|title=TGetting friendly with Five Finger Death Punch (2007)|publisher=Dabelly.com/|access-date=September 26, 2015}}</ref>
