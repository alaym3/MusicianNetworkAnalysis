Billy Dukes of ''[[Taste of Country]]'' reviewed "There Was This Girl" favorably, comparing its theme to "[[Chicks Dig It]]" by [[Chris Cagle]] and noting the more [[neotraditional country]] influence compared to Green's peers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tasteofcountry.com/riley-green-there-was-this-girl/ | title=Don't quit on Riley Green's 'There Was This Girl' [Listen] | work=Taste of Country | accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref> The song charted on [[Country Airplay]], and a music video was shot in October 2018.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://tasteofcountry.com/riley-green-there-was-this-girl-video/ | title=Riley Green's 'There Was This Girl' video comes together thanks to screaming fans | work=Taste of Country | accessdate=October 17, 2018}}</ref>
