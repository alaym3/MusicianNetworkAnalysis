== History ==
=== Early years (2013) ===
Shudall met both Rourke and Plummer through mutual friends at [[Liverpool Sound City]] in 2013, meeting Falconer not long after at the same festival where he worked as a stage manager. During the summer and autumn of 2013 the band played several short UK tours, which included some secret shows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thelineofbestfit.com/new-music/introducing/circa-waves-interview-149554|title=Circa Waves|last=Long|first=Jen|date=4 April 2014|newspaper=The Line of Best Fit|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29}}</ref>  In a July 2014 interview in Paris, Joe Falconer stated regarding the band name's origin, "Kieran wrote the demo for "Young Chasers", recorded it and uploaded it to SoundCloud in one day. As he was uploading it he needed a name and it was the first thing that came into his head in that split second.
