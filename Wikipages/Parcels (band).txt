'''Parcels''' are an Australian electropop five-piece formed in [[Byron Bay, New South Wales|Byron Bay]], [[Australia]], in 2014. Today they are based in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. The band's line-up is composed of keyboardist Louie Swain, keyboardist/guitarist Patrick Hetherington, bassist Noah Hill, drummer Anatole "Toto" Serret, and guitarist Jules Crommelin.

Signed to French label [[Kitsuné]], the band rose to prominence after collaborating with the electronic duo [[Daft Punk]] on the production and writing of their 2017 single "Overnight".

In 2018 Parcels released their self-titled debut record with singles "Tieduprightnow", "Bemyself", "Lightenup" and "Withorwithout". Parcels describe themselves as "sort of a blend between [[electro-pop]] and [[disco]]-[[soul music|soul]]".<ref name="Vogue">{{cite web

=== ''Clockscared'' EP (2015) ===
Parcels released their first EP ''Clockscared'' on 2 March 2015 while they were starting out in [[electronic music]].<ref name="Rebel on a Rainbow">{{cite news|date=2 March 2015|title=ROAR Music Review: Parcels|url=http://rebelonarainbow.com/roar-reviews-posts/2015/3/2/roar-music-review-parcels/|access-date=22 January 2018}}</ref> The EP has six listed tracks and was an independent release made with a single condenser mic.<ref name="wonderlandmagazine.com"/>

=== Working with Daft Punk ===
The release of ''Clockscared'' caught the attention of Parisian label Kitsuné,<ref name="Ross">{{Cite web|title=Byron Bays's Parcels are rapt to be making music and living their dreams|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/byron-bayss-parcels-are-rapt-to-be-making-music-and-living-their-dreams-20171228-h0avyw.html|last=Ross|first=Annabel|date=1 January 2018|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> which signed the band in 2015.

In 2016, Parcels played their first show in [[France]] at Paris' Les Bains bar with Daft Punk in the audience.<ref name="abc.net.au">{{Cite web|title=This is what it's like to work with Daft Punk, Parcels talk 'Overnight'|url=https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/how-parcels-hooked-up-with-daft-punk/8946262|last=Newstead|first=Al|date=14 September 2017|website=triple j|language=en|access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref> The duo invited Parcels to their studio.<ref name="Newstead"/> Parcels say that they had not initially planned to create a song with Daft Punk, "it was just like, let's get creative together and see what happens".<ref>{{Citation|title=Rencontre avec le groupe australien Parcels|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aXoRFbxmuU|language=en|access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>

The band showed Daft Punk an early demo of "Overnight" which they agreed to work on.<ref name="abc.net.au"/> The track was in production for over the course of a year with many studio trips and months in the studio. In an interview on the process, Parcel's keyboardist Patrick Hetherington said that "First we spent seven days in the studio with them, every day from 12 midday up until 4 in the morning, literally working on it overnight."<ref>{{cite web|title=This is what it's like to work with Daft Punk, Parcels talk 'Overnight'|url=https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/news/musicnews/how-parcels-hooked-up-with-daft-punk/8946262|last1=Newstead|first1=Al|date=14 September 2017|website=Triple J|publisher=Triple J|access-date=9 November 2018}}</ref>

On 21 June 2017, Parcels released single "Overnight" with production and co-writing credits from Daft Punk's [[Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo]] and [[Thomas Bangalter]]. The single entered the French charts at position 62, and remained for 11 weeks.<ref>{{Cite web|title=lescharts.com - Parcels - Overnight|url=https://lescharts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=Parcels&titel=Overnight&cat=s|website=lescharts.com|access-date=30 May 2020}}</ref> The song ended up being Daft Punk's final song produced together prior to the duo's split in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kupfer|first=Rachel|title="Overnight" by Parcels Is Officially Daft Punk's Last-Ever Production: Listen|url=https://edm.com/music-releases/overnight-parcels-daft-punk-last-production|access-date=2021-09-23|website=EDM.com - The Latest Electronic Dance Music News, Reviews & Artists|language=en}}</ref>

The single was not listed on the band's following album ''Parcels'', with the band stating that "including it would've felt dishonest to the rest of the record," noting that the time between recording the tracks on their debut and "Overnight" was two years difference and would taint the historical "snapshot" of the album.<ref name="festicket.com"/>

"Overnight" was performed on [[Conan (talk show)|Conan]] in September 2017 as Parcels' US television debut.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Watch Ex-Byron Band Parcels Make Their US TV Debut On 'Conan'|url=http://themusic.com.au/news/all/2017/09/14/watch-ex-byron-band-parcels-make-their-us-tv-debut-on-conan/|date=14 September 2017|website=TheMusic.com.au|access-date=12 January 2018}}</ref>

On 12 October 2018, the band released ''Parcels'', their first full length album (Recorded and mixed at Bewake Studios, former Mesanic Music in Berlin by Martin "Lucky" Waschkowitsch), and including the hit single 'Tieduprightnow', recorded in Berlin at Bakermoon Studios by Ed Bentley, with Because Music, Kitsunè and Caroline Music.

Pegard, for the Australian publication Pilerats, noted the clip was an environmental statement saying that "Northern NSW and Byron Bay are coastal areas that are currently being destroyed by profit-motivated policies and lobbies, and where marine life and ecosystems are disappearing at an alarming rate. The Australian lifestyle as we know it, the joys of summer, of surfing and living by the beach would not be much without its marine ecosystem and wildlife".<ref name=":1" /> "Tieduprightnow" was certified Gold in Australia by  [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) in 2021.<ref name=ARIA-2021-Singles>{{cite certification|region=Australia|type=single|certyear=2021|access-date=7 July 2021}}</ref>

The album was released amidst the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] global [[pandemic]]. Alongside the album, Parcels released instrumental tutorials for the song "IknowhowIfeel" to their [[Instagram]] account. Hill said that "it felt very insensitive and not aware to be releasing anything that wasn't in some way connected to the coronavirus ‘cause that was encapsulating everyone's thoughts".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Parcels Are Ready To Party With You, Once Lockdown Ends Of Course|url=https://scenestr.com.au/music/parcels-are-ready-to-party-with-you-once-lockdown-ends-of-course-20200529|author=Staff Writers|website=scenestr - Pop Culture & Entertainment|language=en-gb|access-date=30 May 2020}}</ref>

''Live Vol. 1'' was released with a video of the recording session. Director Carmen Crommelin, also responsible for directing the "Tape" film clip, said in a press release that she "wanted the camera to be both passive and intimate, so you could politely observe from a distance and walk through the room like a friend".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Parcels Announce New Live Album Recorded at Berlin's Hansa Studio, Share New Live EP and Video|url=http://undertheradarmag.com/news/parcels_announce_new_live_album_recorded_at_berlins_hansa_studio_share_new_|last=Guthrie|first=Lily|website=undertheradarmag.com|language=en|access-date=30 May 2020}}</ref>
