==Early life==
Kentrell Gaulden was born on October 20, 1999, in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]]. He broke his neck while wrestling as a toddler, the injury requiring a head brace until the spine healed. The brace left permanent scars on his forehead.<ref name="FaderProdigy">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefader.com/2017/10/10/youngboy-nba-never-broke-again-cover-story-interview|title=The teen rap prodigy worth rooting for|work=The FADER|access-date=February 26, 2018}}</ref> Gaulden was raised mainly by his maternal grandmother due to his father being sentenced to 55 years in prison.<ref name="FaderProdigy"/> He dropped out of ninth grade and was arrested for [[robbery]] and sent to a detention center in [[Tallulah, Louisiana]]. While there, he began writing lyrics for his debut project.<ref name="XXLBreak"/>

After he was released from the detention center, Gaulden's grandmother died of [[heart failure]] and Gaulden moved in with his friend and fellow Baton Rouge rapper, NBA 3Three (also known as OG 3Three). The two then used acts of criminality to begin to pay for studio time.<ref name="FaderProdigy"/>

==Career==

=== 2015–2017:  Career beginnings and ''AI YoungBoy'' ===
Gaulden first began producing music with a microphone he bought from [[Walmart]] when he was fourteen years old.<ref name="FaderProdigy"/> He released his first mixtape, ''Life Before Fame'' in 2015. A string of other mixtapes followed including ''Mind of a Menace'', ''Mind of a Menace 2'', and ''Before I Go''. Gaulden attracted attention with his October 2016 mixtape, ''38 Baby''<ref name="XXLBreak" /><ref name="XXLPrison" /> which featured fellow Baton Rouge natives, [[Boosie Badazz]], [[Kevin Gates]], and fellow rappers Stroke Tha Don and NBA 3Three.<ref name="XXL38" /> A week later, Gaulden released another mixtape titled ''Mind of a Menace 3'' on November 4, 2016''.'' Gaulden quick rise to popularity could also be attributed to his "song-for-song rap beef" with fellow Baton Rouge rapper Scotty Cain in December 2015, in which songs from both rappers included death threats. Although no real violence ever occurred between the two Baton Rouge rappers, their feuding attracted a lot of attention.<ref name="XXLPrison">{{cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2017/02/youngboy-never-broke-again-prison-interview/|title=YoungBoy Never Broke Again Says He's Finding Himself in First Interview From Prison|work=XXL|last=Weinstein|first=Max|date=February 1, 2017|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref><ref name="XXL38">{{cite news|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2016/10/nba-youngboy-38-baby-mixtape-kevin-gates-boosie-badazz/|title=NBA YoungBoy Drops '38 Baby' Mixtape Featuring Kevin Gates, Boosie BadAzz and More|work=XXL|last=Ivey|first=Justin|date=October 27, 2016|access-date=August 18, 2017}}</ref>
