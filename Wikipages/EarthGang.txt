== History ==
===2008–2009: Formation===
The rap duo EarthGang was first formed in 2008 by Johnny Venus and Doctur Dot, then both high school students in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].<ref name="egangb">{{cite news| title = The Break Presents: EarthGang| first = Eric| last = Diep| url = http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/the-break/2014/02/the-break-presents-earthgang/| newspaper = [[XXL Magazine]]| date = February 3, 2014| access-date = 2014-09-27}}</ref> According to Johnny Venus, they had first met on a field trip in 9th grade at [[Benjamin Elijah Mays High School]], with Venus later approaching Doctur Dot to ask about forming a music group.<ref name="egange">{{cite news| title = Atlanta natives EarthGang sound nothing like stereotypical Atlanta (c)rap| first = Myles E.| last = Johnson| url = http://clatl.com/cribnotes/archives/2011/01/31/atlanta-natives-earthgang-sound-nothing-like-stereotypical-atlanta-crap| newspaper = [[Creative Loafing (Atlanta)]] | date = January 31, 2011| access-date = 2014-09-27}}</ref> Avid fans of [[rap]] and [[hip hop]], both members had grown up listening to artists as diverse as the [[Ohio Players]], [[Dizzy Gillespie]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], and [[Richard Pryor]].<ref name="egangb"/> About their name EarthGang, Venus explained in 2011 that "The name came to me abruptly one day. It represents what we're made of and why we do what we do. It's for the people by the people. Our music is influenced by the conscious and subconscious, and we create it to influence the like."<ref name="egange"/>

===2010–2013: Early releases===
On January 26, 2010 the group released its first EP, the mixtape titled ''The Better Party.'' Their first full-length recording project, they recorded in a multitude of studio spaces, which, according to Venus, included "dorm rooms at [[Hampton University]], closets in Atlanta, a house studio owned by 'Mr. Fish' (a fellow underground Atlanta musician), and finally in Hampton University's Music Recording Technology Jazz studio." The EP was mixed and mastered by EarthGang, with help from Jack Swain.<ref name="egange"/> Also in 2010, they began touring in the United States, performing at festivals such as the [[Festivals in Atlanta|A3C Festival]] in Atlanta.<ref name="egange"/> They released periodic singles as well, and in November 2010 they debuted the song "Miss the Show."<ref name="egange"/> In early 2011 they taped and released a music video for "Kick'n It", a track first included on ''The Better Party.''<ref name="egange"/> Soon afterwards they released the single "Opium",<ref name="egange"/> which they would later film a music video for. The group self-released two albums in 2011: ''Mad Men'' in April, and ''Good News'' in December.

They released their track "The F Bomb" on June 4, 2012. The song would later be included on a 2014 album and was made into a music video. "Machete", a single produced by [[808 Mafia]], was self-released by EarthGang on February 10, 2013, shortly before the release of their music video for their 2012 single "Fire Kicking Tree Limbs". In March 2013 the group released "UFOs",<ref name="egangg">{{cite news| title = EarthGang – "UFOS"| first = Jon| last = Tanners| url = http://pigeonsandplanes.com/2013/03/earthgang-ufos/| publisher = Pigeons and Planes| date = March 11, 2013| access-date = 2014-09-27}}</ref> a slow single over nine minutes long.<ref name="egangg"/> According to a review in ''Pigeons and Planes'', "Sexual, contemplative, sprawling, and slow, EarthGang's 'UFOs' veers far left from the duo's last music expedition 'Machete' and hews a bit closer to the earthy soul that typified so much mid-'90s [[Dungeon Family]] output."<ref name="egangg"/> They again performed at the A3C Festival in early 2013,<ref name="egangb"/> also opening for Black Fest at [[Stanford University]].<ref name="egangb"/>
