==Career==

===2000–2007: Group formation and Polydor Records===
Performing as the ''Lickle Rinsers Crew'', they released the singles "Bad Man Riddim" and "Life is Getting Sicker by the Day".

After ''Lickle Rinsers Crew'', they then became ''NW1''. This originated from the phrase ''[[Hakuna Matata]]''. they were originally intended to be ''Hukuna Matata'' after they changed from ''the Lickle Rinsers Crew''', but due to copyright from [[Disney]], they decided to change to ''No Worries'' instead. Due to the fact there was already another group known as ''No Worries'' they decided to change instead to NW for a short time, but due to the confusion from [[Compton, California|Compton]]-based rap group [[N.W.A.]], they finally changed to NW1 (both after their postcode district and as a slight nod to The Lion King) which was later to be changed to N-Dubz.<ref>[[Hakuna Matata#Influence on origin of N-Dubz]]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eventseeker.com/artist/3653-n-dubz|title=N-Dubz - Artist Profile|website=eventseeker.com|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200304103604/https://eventseeker.com/artist/3653-n-dubz|archive-date=4 March 2020|access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref> After making their first music video in 2005 for the track "Everyday of My Life", which received airplay on Channel U, recording more demos as NW1 such as "Don't Feel Like Moving", "Girl On Road" and "Livin Broke", their first single to be released was "[[You Better Not Waste My Time]]", which was available for download only until their 2006 self-released single, "[[I Swear (N-Dubz song)|I Swear]]", which gained them their first mainstream notice. It wasn't until 2007's "[[Feva Las Vegas]]" (also self-released) that the group appeared on the UK charts, peaking at No. 57.<ref>[http://acharts.us/song/26065 Feva Las Vegas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921013844/http://acharts.us/song/26065 |date=21 September 2011 }}.

In mid-2007, Dappy released "Love for my Slum" with fellow UK artist Baker Trouble. This song was number one on [[Channel AKA|Channel U]] for many weeks and was a big hit with the UK underground rap scene but was heavily criticised by the media for a scene in which Dappy is stood outside a block of expensive luxury flats with a "rich kid" who is trying to look like a gangster. ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote, "His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement..."; they then went on to put "Do scenes like these suggest that music videos are encouraging their viewers to indulge in criminality?".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/music-video-violence-should-grime-clean-up-its-act-403286.html |title=Music video violence: Should grime clean up its act? – Media, News |work=The Independent |location=London |date=24 September 2007 |access-date=4 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202023845/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/music-video-violence-should-grime-clean-up-its-act-403286.html |archive-date=2 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Dappy appeared on the television show ''[[Never Mind the Buzzcocks]]'' on 29 November 2007, on Phill Jupitus's team, and wore a trademark "Dappy hat", also giving one to [[Simon Amstell]] to wear as part of the gag. Despite vowing he would not return to the show, he appeared for a second time on the guest team on 4 December 2008 and for a third time, on Phill's team, which was broadcast on 18 November 2009.

===2009–2010: ''Against All Odds''===
Tulisa and Dappy reprised their roles in the third and final series of the Channel 4 show ''Dubplate Drama''.

On 1 April 2010, they released their first book, ''N-Dubz – Against All Odds: From Street Life to Chart Life'', which they described as "the answer to the critics, there is a lot of bad press about N-Dubz at the moment and this is going to put the record straight about who we really are and what we're about!", saying they want to put "everything out there", and Fazer also adding "It's going to surprise you!".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10070000/newsid_10075700/10075784.stm | work=BBC News | title=N-Dubz hit back at critics by launching autobiography | access-date=19 May 2010 | date=1 April 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425042218/http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10070000/newsid_10075700/10075784.stm | archive-date=25 April 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> The book also gives access to a secret N-Dubz website.

===2010–2011: Def Jam deal & ''Love.Live.Life''===

The group filmed a 6-part documentary, ''[[Being... N-Dubz]]'', which premiered on 21 June 2010 on [[4Music]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ndubz.com/news/being-n-dubz-starts-tonight |title=News |publisher=Ndubz.com |access-date=31 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710204835/http://ndubz.com/news/being-n-dubz-starts-tonight |archive-date=10 July 2012  }}</ref> and was later renewed for a second series in 2011.<ref name="We Bullied">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/19/dappy-ndubz-interview Dappy: 'We bullied our way in'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170420085254/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/19/dappy-ndubz-interview |date=20 April 2017 }} The Guardian. 19 September 2011. Retrieved 20 September 2011</ref> After much speculation, it was confirmed that US label [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] signed the group. The first release was the album ''[[Love.Live.Life]]'', N-Dubz's third studio album. It was released in the UK on 29 November 2010.

Five singles were released from ''Love.Live.Life''. The first, "[[We Dance On]]", had previously been released in May 2010 from the ''[[StreetDance 3D|StreetDance]]'' soundtrack. On 1 September 2010, N-Dubz announced via Facebook that their first new single from the album would be "[[Best Behaviour (N-Dubz song)|Best Behaviour]]", which was eventually released on 17 October. The music video premiered on [[Channel AKA]] and [[Clubland TV]] on 8 September and was uploaded on YouTube by [[All Around the World Productions|AATW Records]] later that day.<ref>{{youtube|9n85vK5Ozns|"Best Behaviour" music video}} Retrieved on 9 September 2010.</ref>

The final three singles from ''Love. Life. Live'' were "[[Girls (N-Dubz song)|Girls]]", "[[So Alive (Skepta and N-Dubz song)|So Alive]]" and "[[Morning Star (song)|Morning Star]]".<ref>[http://ndubz.com/news/morning-star-official-music-video MORNING STAR – OFFICIAL MUSIC VIDEO] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120722095045/http://ndubz.com/news/morning-star-official-music-video |date=22 July 2012 }} ''ndubz.com''.

===2011–2012: ''Greatest Hits'', hiatus and proposed reunion===
In August 2011, it emerged that N-Dubz had parted company with record label Def Jam, stating that they were "Never going to co-operate with them when they decided to change what we are".<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0813/ndubz.html | title=N-Dubz no longer signed to US record label | date=13 August 2011 | work=RTÉ News | access-date=14 August 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115234140/http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0813/ndubz.html | archive-date=15 January 2012 | url-status=live }}</ref> With Tulisa taking up a role as a judge on [[The X Factor (UK series 8)|series 8]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' and Dappy releasing his solo single "[[No Regrets (Dappy song)|No Regrets]]", N-Dubz' gig on 18 September 2011 was described as "their final gig for the foreseeable future".<ref name="We Bullied" />

In November, Tulisa confirmed that N-Dubz were undergoing a two-year hiatus as Dappy and herself pursued solo careers. A ''Greatest Hits'' album was released on 28 November 2011.

In 2012, underground singer-songwriter Jan's second single, "Fuck U and Goodbye", is credited with featuring N-Dubz, although the verse, which is performed by Dappy and Fazer, is actually a sample from one of the group's podcast freestyles. The non-profit self-released free single was released on 19 November 2012.

In an interview with [[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]] on 24 September 2012, Tulisa said a reunion was in the works for 2013, after hers and Dappy's solo albums had been released.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.4music.com/news/news/6216/Tulisa-confirms-N-Dubz-reunion |title=Tulisa confirms N-Dubz reunion &#124; General &#124; News |publisher=4Music |date=26 September 2012 |access-date=9 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109204657/http://www.4music.com/news/news/6216/Tulisa-confirms-N-Dubz-reunion |archive-date=9 January 2014  }}</ref> On 6 October 2012, during an edition of ''[[The X Factor UK|The X Factor]]'', Tulisa once again confirmed that N-Dubz would be reforming. On 13 April 2017, when asked on the prospect of a reunion, Fazer replied, saying "100 per cent, that’s definitely going to come really soonish. Not right now, we’ve all got individual things we’re focusing on at the minute, but obviously it’s all about timing."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/n-dubz-confirm-theyll-reuniting-really-soonish-2049322|title=N Dubz confirm that they'll be reuniting 'really soonish' - NME|date=13 April 2017|work=NME|access-date=15 April 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170414052024/http://www.nme.com/news/music/n-dubz-confirm-theyll-reuniting-really-soonish-2049322|archive-date=14 April 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/celebrity-news/1049281/n-dubz-comeback-fazer-reunion-dappy-tulisa-contostavlos-music|title=N-Dubz ARE making a comeback: Fazer exclusively confirms reunion|last=Knight|first=Kathryn|date=13 April 2017|work=OK!

Despite initial plans to return from hiatus, the band have not officially announced a comeback, therefore meaning that N-Dubz disbanded in 2011.

==Controversy==
N-Dubz had been involved in much media criticism and publicised controversy mainly to do with [[Dappy]]. Since early 2010 Dappy and Fazer have both been struggling to secure U.S. visas due to their past convictions.{{cn|date=January 2020}}

On 31 January 2009 Dappy and [[Richard Rawson|Fazer]] were escorted from a BA flight from [[Edinburgh]] to London by police after it touched down, after allegedly threatening other passengers. A source told ''The Sun'' "They were swearing at kids on the plane, being foul and threatening passengers. Cabin crew called ahead to the police, who were waiting when the plane landed. They were taken away by armed officers."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a145368/n-dubz-removed-from-plane-by-armed-police.html |title=Showbiz – News – N-Dubz removed from plane by armed police |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2 February 2009 |access-date=4 December 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408191427/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/news/a145368/n-dubz-removed-from-plane-by-armed-police.html |archive-date=8 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In late 2009, a feud started between Tulisa and [[Elly Jackson]] of [[La Roux]] who stated that all the females that do [[hip hop]] music dress up like prostitutes. Tulisa took offence saying "she shouldn't talk about people's jobs that way... it's just wrong, where was she brought up – in a barn?", calling Jackson a "twat".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a182784/n-dubz-tulisa-la-roux-is-a-twt.html |title=Digital Spy N-Dubz Tulisa: 'La Roux is a tw*t' |work=Digital Spy |date=20 October 2009 |access-date=31 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022021220/http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a182784/n-dubz-tulisa-la-roux-is-a-twt.html |archive-date=22 October 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Later that month it surfaced that N-Dubz's DJ Maze had allegedly raped a young fan after a show N-Dubz had done at [[Butlins]] holiday camp in Skegness. They instead had [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]]'s Twin B as their Christmas Party Tour DJ.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/18/n-dubz | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=N-Dubz members to assist police after DJ's rape arrest | first=Sean | last=Michaels | date=18 November 2009 | access-date=19 May 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305171709/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/nov/18/n-dubz | archive-date=5 March 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref>

On 12 January 2010, N-Dubz appeared on ''[[The Chris Moyles Show]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The show received a text message from a Chloe Moody in Boston, [[Lincolnshire]] complaining that Dappy was "vile" and "a little boy with a silly hat" and that N-Dubz were "losers". Dappy secretly copied Moody's phone number from the studio console and, the following day, tried calling her and sent threatening messages including: "Your [sic] gonna die. U sent a very bad msg towards Ndubz on The Chris Moyels [sic] show yesterday Morning and for that reason u will never be left alone!!! u say sorry I will leave u alone u ****."  Moody claimed that she continued to receive messages after declining to apologise but N-Dubz management later apologised on his behalf and offered free tickets to one of his concerts, although Dappy has not apologised to Moody personally.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8461267.stm |title=BBC News – N-Dubz star Dappy 'sorry' over text message threats|publisher=BBC  |date=15 January 2010 |access-date=15 January 2010}}</ref> The rapper had appeared with the then-Schools Secretary Ed Balls to launch pop single "RU Cyber Safe" in November 2009, but was dropped from the campaign with Mr Balls saying: "This text message was completely unacceptable and it is right that he has not only apologised, but accepted there was no excuse for his behaviour."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8461267.stm|title=Dappy 'sorry' over text threats|date=15 January 2010|access-date=10 January 2020|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819035552/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8461267.stm|archive-date=19 August 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2010, a dispute then started between N-Dubz and [[Lethal Bizzle]], who claimed he had written and produced N-Dubz's hit "[[I Need You (N-Dubz song)|I Need You]]" for them and so should be acknowledged in the credits for it, with Tulisa hitting back on Twitter that "he's jus triena boost his status, ...wat an unbelievable loser!"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/eppri |title=TwitLonger — When you talk too much for Twitter |publisher=Twitlonger.com |access-date=3 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308084718/http://www.twitlonger.com/show/eppri |archive-date=8 March 2012  }}</ref> and N-Dubz later posted a video on their official YouTube channel through Twitter with the caption: "THE PROOF WE DIDNT STEAL S**T, WE MAKE OUR OWN HITS!" of when he had sent them the finished song and when they had actually finished the song, implying that their version was over 2 months older than his.<!-- Videos have been removed<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5GldvKb0fw&feature=channel|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMpGLzS9BNU&feature=channel|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>-->
