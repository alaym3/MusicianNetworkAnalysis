'''Jarabe de Palo''' ("Wooden Stick Syrup" or, by virtue of the Spanish expression „dar un jarabe de palo“, a „hell of a beating“) were a [[Spanish rock]] band, once led by singer, songwriter and guitarist [[Pau Donés]].

On 9 June 2020, Donés died at the age of 53.<ref name="Pau dies">{{cite web |title=Leader of Jarabe de Palo band Pau Donés dies at 53 |url=https://www.catalannews.com/culture/item/leader-of-jarabe-de-palo-band-pau-dones-dies-at-53 |website=Catalan News |access-date=9 June 2020}}</ref>

== Going Independent ==
In 2008, the band announced they were going to leave their record company and go independent, founding their own record label [[Tronco Records]]. They changed their name to "Jarabedepalo" because their former record label had the rights to the name.

In 2009 they released, ''Orquesta Reciclando'' (''Recycling Orchestra''), in which they recorded new versions of their old songs, and one new song. ''¿Y Ahora que Hacemos?'' (''Now What Are We Going to Do?''), was released in 2011 and ''Somos'' (''We Are'') in 2014.

== Awards and collaborations ==

The group has received Premios de la Música, [[Premio Ondas]] and [[Grammy]] nominations. They have collaborated with La Vieja Trova Santiaguera, [[Antonio Vega (singer)|Antonio Vega]], [[Vico C]] and [[Celia Cruz]] (soundtrack of ''[[El milagro de P. Tinto]]''). Donés has also composed tracks for [[Ricky Martin]] and starred in a music video with [[Alanis Morissette]]. They also collaborated with Italian musicians [[Jovanotti]], [[Niccolò Fabi]], [[Modà]] and [[Ermal Meta]].
