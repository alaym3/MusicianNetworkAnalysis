'''I See Stars''' is an American [[electronicore]] band that formed in 2006 based in [[Warren, Michigan]], United States. The band currently consists of lead vocalist Devin Oliver, guitarist Brent Allen, keyboardist and co-vocalist Andrew Oliver, and bass guitarist Jeff Valentine.

Their first album, ''[[3-D (I See Stars album)|3-D]]'' (2009), peaked at No. 176 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Their second album, ''[[The End of the World Party]]'', was released on February 22, 2011. The band's third studio album, ''[[Digital Renegade]]'', was released on March 13, 2012, which demonstrated a stylistic change, featuring a more aggressive musical style than their prior albums.<ref>{{cite web|last=Aid |first=Band |url=http://bandaidrecords.com/tag/digital-renegade/ |title=digital renegade |publisher=Band Aid Records |access-date=2013-12-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203071224/http://bandaidrecords.com/tag/digital-renegade/ |archive-date=2013-12-03 }}</ref> The band also appeared on the song, "Beauty and the Beast", by [[Dubstep]] producer BARE. The band's fourth studio album, ''[[New Demons]]'', was released October 22, 2013, which featured elements of [[electronic dance music|EDM]] while achieving an even further aggressive style than ''Digital Renegade''. On March 25, 2015, the band released their first [[remix album]], titled ''[[Phases (I See Stars album)|Phases]]''. The band's line-up remained unchanged, (excluding the brief departure of vocalist Zach Johnson in 2009, who returned the following year) from their formation in 2006, up until mid-2015, when the group announced the departure of rhythm guitarist Jimmy Gregerson and Johnson. Lead vocalist Devin Oliver now pursues both [[clean vocals]] and [[unclean vocals]]. Their fifth studio album and the first album featuring the new line-up, ''[[Treehouse (I See Stars album)|Treehouse]]'', was released on June 17, 2016. Drummer Luke Holland played the drum track for this album, while Andrew Oliver started his place on the keyboard. Their latest release is the Treehouse Acoustic EP, which was released on April 6, 2018. 

The band has released all six of their studio albums, and other releases, through their record label [[Sumerian Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sumerianrecords.com/artist/details/id:12/|title=I See Stars|website=Sumerianrecords.com|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>

==History==

===Formation and early releases (2006–08)===
In an interview with BVTV,<ref name="BVTV">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n39XRvf73JU |title=I See Stars Interview – BVTV "Band of the Week" HD |publisher=BVTV |access-date=4 January 2010}}</ref> featuring band members Devin and Andrew Oliver as brothers and Brent Allen as close friends, Oliver stated: "me, Brent, the drummer's my brother, and the bass player, Jeff, we all lived on the block from each other since we were kids, [in] elementary school." In the same interview, it is also stated that there is no specific reason for the band's name, I See Stars, other than the fact they needed a title and "someone brought it to the table". The band was officially formed in 2006.

The group released its debut EP ''Green Light Go!'' in 2007 and several [[demo tape|demo]]s, including a self-titled EP, before signing with [[Sumerian Records]] in 2008.<ref name=allmusic>[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p1122695/biography|pure_url=yes}} Biography], [[Allmusic]]</ref>

===''3-D'',  Johnson's departure and Moore's arrival (2008–09)===
I See Stars recorded their debut album, ''[[3-D (I See Stars album)|3-D]]'', in 2008 at Chango Gridlock Studios in [[Orlando, Florida]] with producer Cameron Mizell. The album featured Zach Johnson as the [[Screaming (music)|screamer]] and keyboardist. Johnson left the band soon after the album's release on April 14, 2009, due to personal problems he felt interfered with him too much while on tour. The band then gained Chris Moore, formerly of [[We Came as Romans]] and a merchandise salesman for the group, to join as the new screamer and keyboardist. 
In August 2008, I See Stars embarked on the second annual "Artery Foundation Across the Nation" tour, headlined by [[Emarosa]] with supporters [[Our Last Night]], [[In Fear and Faith]], [[Burden of a Day]] and Broadway. In late 2009, I See Stars finished touring with [[Attack Attack!]], [[Breathe Carolina]], [[Asking Alexandria]] and [[Bury Tomorrow]] for the third annual ''Artery Foundation Across the Nation'' tour.<ref name="The Artery Foundation, LLC">{{cite web|url=http://www.thearteryfoundation.com/home.html?gluepage=4#glue_news_content|title=The Artery Foundation, LLC.|date=15 December 2009|publisher=Artery Foundation|access-date=4 January 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716222617/http://www.thearteryfoundation.com/home.html?gluepage=4#glue_news_content|archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref>

===Moore's departure, Johnson's return and ''The End of the World Party'' (2010)===
On June 14, 2010, the band's keyboardist/screamer Chris Moore announced his departure from the band, citing "artistic differences". After being asked to re-join, former I See Stars member Zach Johnson returned to the band and joined them on Warped Tour 2010.

The group entered the studio in March 2010 to begin writing and recording their sophomore studio album called ''[[The End of the World Party]]'' with Sumerian Records and ''3-D'' producer Cameron Mizell.
Almost immediately after finishing the album, the band played Vans [[Warped Tour]] from June 24 to July 18, 2010.<ref name="Vans Warped Tour 2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.vanswarpedtour.com/warpedtour/band.asp?xid=20332 |title=Vans Warped Tour 2010 |publisher=[[Vans]] |access-date=4 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091224075229/http://www.vanswarpedtour.com/warpedtour/band.asp?xid=20332 |archive-date=24 December 2009 }}</ref>

With help from Sumerian Records and our friends Frankie Palmeri & Mattie Montgomery, it became about a scene that is much like the hallways we walked down as teenagers. We used the iconic lyrics from a song by [[Bane (band)|Bane]] that changed the scene before bands like us were even around and still holds a place in a lot of hearts. We're all here to connect through music and to be a part of a movement that embraces open minds and open hearts. Unfortunately, some people choose to thrive off negativity, disunion and narcissism. This song goes out to all our peers and friends who live on the road doing it every single year, but more importantly to all the fans who make this all possible. This is not a song off the forthcoming album. It's the closing chapter to [digital_renegade] and the opening track to our digital mixtape release titled "Renegades Forever"."
