'''Veridia''', often stylized in all capital letters as '''VERIDIA''', is an American [[alternative rock]] band from [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. Formed in 2013, the group now consists of Deena Jakoub (vocals), Brandon Brown (guitar), and Kyle Levy (drums). The band's music has been charted on [[Christian rock]] and [[contemporary Christian music]] charts, although the band themselves reject this label.

They released ''Inseparable EP'' in 2014 and ''Pretty Lies EP'' in 2015 on [[Word Records|Word Entertainment]]/[[Curb Records|Curb]], [[Warner Music Group]]. ''Summer Sessions Vol. 1'' EP was released in 2016 as a free download. ''The Beast You Feed'', their first full-length album, was independently released on October 26, 2018.

== History ==

=== Beginnings (2012–2013) ===

Veridia formed when Deena Jakoub (vocals) and Brandon Brown (guitar) moved from [[Dallas]] to [[Nashville]] after the end of their previous band Don't Wake Aislin, in late 2012.<ref name=BillboardBiography>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/5901307/veridia/biography|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 6, 2015}}</ref> Seeking a new start with a fresh sound, they quickly recruited Trevor Hinesley (guitar) and Kyle Levy (drums) to round out the quartet (unnamed at the time) in December 2012.<ref name="JW interview">{{cite web | url=http://www.jesuswired.com/interview-veridia | title=An Interview With VERIDIA… | publisher=Jesus Wired | access-date=April 25, 2014}}</ref> They do not have a bassist as a permanent band member in the band, nor do they have one performing in a live setting.

In early 2013, the group began writing and demoing songs with various co-writers and producers in Nashville while trying to determine what they would name their newly formed group. They eventually settled on Veridia, a combination of the words "veritas" ([[Latin]] for "truth") and "veridical" (also meaning "truth").<ref name="JW interview" /> Of the name, Jakoub says, "Veridia means 'of truth.' It's our creed, to strive for raw honesty in all that we do, being true to ourselves, the ones we love and in our music."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wordlabelgroup.com/news/2014/02/04/introducingveridia | title=Introducing VERIDIA... | publisher=Word Label Group | access-date=February 4, 2014}}</ref> To include a form of "truth" as part of their name was inspired by [[Kahlil Gibran]].<ref name="JW interview" /> They call the naming process one of the biggest early challenges the band had overcome.<ref name="JW interview" /> In a Q&A at Pulse Radio headquarters in 2016, guitarist Hinesley stated that the name for the band was almost "Aviara". "We had the dumbest band names in the world," he said. "Don't hire us if you need a band name!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Pulse1017/videos/1281454701872241/|title=Pulse 101.7 FM - Timeline {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=July 28, 2016}}</ref>

=== ''Inseparable'' EP and Winter Jam (2014–2015) ===
[[File:Veridia2.jpg|thumb|The band playing at a venue in 2014]]
Before recording ''Inseparable'', the band wrote more than 70 songs trying to develop their sound and find their identity as a young band.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.theredledger.net/2014/06/11/artist-spotlight-part-four-veridia | title=Artist spotlight part four: Veridia | publisher=The Red Ledger | access-date=June 11, 2014}}</ref> Of those songs, they eventually narrowed the list down to 5 songs they would take into the studio with three different [[record producer|producers]]. "We Are the Brave," "Disconnected," and "Furious Love" were produced by [[Ian Eskelin]]; "Mechanical Planet" was produced by [[Matt Bronleewe]]; "Mystery of the Invisible" was produced by Stephen Keech (of [[Haste the Day]]).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/inseparable-mw0002620010 | title=Inseparable - VERIDIA | publisher=All Music | access-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Jakoub is quoted as to have been listening to bands such as [[Chvrches]], [[Twenty One Pilots]], and [[Panic! at the Disco]] while helping write songs.<ref name="JW interview" />

On February 4, 2014, the band released an album trailer video on YouTube and launched an iTunes pre-order with "We Are the Brave" as an instant free track.
