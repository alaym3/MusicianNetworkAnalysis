===Religion===
Levi was raised a [[Christians|Christian]]. In a 2002 interview with ''[[Relevant Magazine]]'', he said:<blockquote>My job on my set, I believe, is to first just love people and gain that trust with people where they know that I really do love them and care about their well-being, so that when they are running into problems, they will hopefully, at some point, come to me and ask me, 'What is your peace all about? What is your comfort all about? Where do you get your love? Where do you get your talents?' And I can turn to them and say without blinking, 'Jesus Christ.'<ref>{{cite news |title=Q&A With Zachary Levi |work=[[Relevant (magazine)|Relevant Magazine]]|url=https://relevantmagazine.com/culture/film/features/2830-qaa-with-zachary-levi |date=April 30, 2003|access-date=October 13, 2009}}</ref></blockquote>

In a 2018 interview with [[Michael Rosenbaum]], Levi said, "I'm very spiritual, but not particularly religious." While avowing belief in God, he said, "[Religion] is, in my opinion, very destructive to what I believe the true heart and spirit then essence of who God is."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ep 22: Zachary Levi from Inside of You with Michael Rosenbaum|url=https://www.stitcher.com/s?eid=56091294|access-date=June 6, 2020|website=www.stitcher.com|language=en}}</ref>
