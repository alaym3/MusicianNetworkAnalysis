== Music ==

=== "Welcome to Hell" (1995) ===
Mutsurayev's debut album, Welcome to Hell, was recorded in 1995, when he was 19 years old. The title of the album, and the song of the same name within it, is a reference to the inscription left by the Chechens for Russian soldiers on the walls in Grozny during the first assault on the city, which began on December 31, 1994.<ref name=":0" /> 

=== "Gelaevsky Special Forces" (1996) ===
Galaevsky Special Forces, Mutsurayev's second album, Written during his service in the [[Borz]] battalion of [[Ruslan Gelayev]]. Compared to the previous one, this album contains more songs, many of them are dedicated to those killed in the war. The song "Serzhen-Yurt," is dedicated to Mutsurayev's deceased friend Aslan Yakhyaev, with whom Mutsurayev has professionally engaged in karate since the late 1980s. In 1994, they decided to take part in the war. Despite the fact that the song was released on the second album of Mutsurayev, according to him, it was from this song that his musical career began.<ref name=":0" /> 

=== "Paradise under the shadow of sabers" (1997) ===
The song "Russian soldier (Mom, take me out of Chechnya)" was written allegedly under the impression of an unsent letter found on a dead Russian serviceman. The song was very popular among the Russian military. The federal command tried to impose a ban on the distribution of Mutsurayev's songs, but this did not have much success due to the great popularity of these songs.<ref name=":0" /> 

=== Jerusalem (1998) ===
The album and its title track are considered the most famous of Mutsurayev's works.<ref name=":0" /> The album is dedicated to the war in the [[Holy Land]], life, love and [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israel themes]]. The song "[[Jerusalem]]" was played at the beginning of [[Aleksei Balabanov|Alexei Balabanov's]] film ''[[War (2002 film)|War]]''. Publicist [[Avraham Shmulevich]] regards the song as "blatantly anti-Israel", citing excerpts from an interview with Mutsurayev, where the singer emphasizes the need to "conquer" Jerusalem. The song is on a list of extremist materials, and, despite the free distribution of the film "War", the distribution of the song itself in Russia can be regarded as "mass distribution of extremist materials", which is an administrative offense.<ref name=":0" /> The theme of Jerusalem is found in other songs of Mutsurayev.

=== "Insha'Allah, the gardens are waiting for us" (2001) ===
The title of the album contains a ritual prayer exclamation used in Muslim countries as a sign of a Muslim's [[Inshallah|humility before the will of Allah]]. The song "Our Sisters" is dedicated to 17-year-old Khava Barayeva, [[June 2000 Chechnya suicide bombings|who blew herself up in a truck with explosives near a Russian checkpoint]]. 

=== Song bans in Russia ===
The case on the recognition of Mutsurayev's songs as [[Islamic extremism|extremist]] was submitted to the Yurginsky City Court of the Kemerovo Region in December 2008, but the decision to ban 20 songs was made only on April 14, 2010.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Кемеровский суд запретил песни Тимура Муцураева|url=http://www.sova-center.ru/racism-xenophobia/news/counteraction/2010/08/d19456|access-date=2021-10-17|website=SOVA Center for Information and Analysis}}</ref> It was initially unknown how many songs were considered in court, but according to the Sova analytical center, the prosecutor's office tried to ban about 100 songs. Most of Mutsurayev's songs are still available for listening, but the songs included in the Federal List of Extremist Materials are banned. For example, on January 25, 2013, the magistrate of precinct No. 37 of the [[Maloyaroslavets]] district of the Kaluga region brought to administrative responsibility and fined a resident of the district who posted the song "Chechens" on his [[VK (service)|VKontakte]] page.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Экстремистские материалы :|url=https://minjust.gov.ru/ru/extremist-materials/?field_extremist_content_value=%D0%BC%D1%83%D1%86%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B5%D0%B2|access-date=2021-10-17|website=Министерство юстиции Российской Федерации|language=ru}}</ref>

Other songs of Mutsurayev do not cause complaints from the Russian authorities, and other artists even perform them in public.<ref name=":0" /> On December 28, 2020, on the basis of the decision of the [[Sovetsky District, Novosibirsk|Sovetsky District]] Court of [[Bryansk]] on September 7, 2020, the compositions "Gelaevsky Special Forces" and "[[Shamil Basayev|Shamil]] Leads a Detachment" were added to the list of extremist materials on the territory of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]].
