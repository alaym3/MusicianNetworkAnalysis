'''Babasónicos''' is an [[Argentine rock]] band, formed in the early 1990s along with others such as [[Peligrosos Gorriones]] and [[Los Brujos]]. After emerging in the wave of Argentine New Rock bands of the late 1980s and early 1990s, Babasonicos became one of the banner groups of the "sonic" underground rock movement in Argentina in the late 1990s.

The band name refers partly to [[Sai Baba of Shirdi|Sai Baba]], the Indian guru, and partly to ''[[The Jetsons]]'', whose Spanish version is called ''Los Supersónicos''.

The lead singer Adrián "Dárgelos" Rodríguez and the keyboardist Diego "Uma-T" Tuñón initially decided to create a new style, which wouldn't follow the established Argentine music. The other official band members are: Diego "Uma" Rodríguez (guitarist and lead singer), Diego "Panza" Castellano (drummer), Mariano "Roger" Domínguez (guitarist), and recently deceased Gabriel "Gabo" Manelli (bassist).

For their second album, ''[[Trance Zomba]]'' (1994), they incorporated a guest [[DJ]], "DJ Peggyn" who would eventually remain as a band member until after releasing ''[[Miami (Babasonicos album)|Miami]]'' (1999). This same year the band saw the departure of their longtime manager Cosme.

In 1999, they collaborated with [[Ian Brown]] on a song that bears their name on his album ''[[Golden Greats (Ian Brown Album)|Golden Greats]]''.

In 2001, the band released ''[[Jessico]],'' their most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album up to that point, reaching a broad mainstream audience with singles like ''"Los Calientes"'', ''"El Loco"'' and ''"Deléctrico"''.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Jessico: El disco de una década|url=https://indiehoy.com/indieayer/jessico-disco-una-decada/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

The following records, ''[[Infame (album)|Infame]]'' (2003), ''[[Anoche]]'' (2005) and ''[[Mucho]] (2008) ''continued with a streak of critical praise and commercial success, each one being selected by several media outlets as one of the best Argentine albums of their respective years. <ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Babasónicos|url=https://rock.com.ar/artistas/133/biografia|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

Babasonicos also composed the [[soundtrack]] for [[Vera Fogwill]]'s movie ''[[Las Mantenidas Sin Sueños (film)|Las Mantenidas Sin Sueños]]'' (''[[Kept and Dreamless]]''), which was released in 2007. The album was composed in 2003.

On January 12, 2008, the band posted an entry on their official site in which they informed that their longtime bassist, Gabriel Manelli had died as a result of [[Hodgkin's disease]], which he had been suffering since the tour supporting the album ''Infame''. Multi-instrumentalist and long-time friend [[Carca]] joined the group in replace of Manelli in their 2011 album ''[[A Propósito]]''. <ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=A propósito de Babasónicos: Chicos desorden|url=https://vos.lavoz.com.ar/content/proposito-babasonicos-chicos-desorden|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> 

They released their latest album "Discutible", in 2018.
