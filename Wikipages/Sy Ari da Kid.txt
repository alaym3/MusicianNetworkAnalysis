== Artistry ==
Talking about his musical process, Brockington said, "I don't write. I like to freestyle until I come off with a good hook or a good start to a verse. I don't like creating from scratch with other artists and producers as much as I should." He also felt he was not narrowed down by a single genre. He said, "I'm not an [[Atlanta]] or [[New York (state)|New York]] rapper, I feel I'm beyond a rapper. I like all genres of music and can create them as well".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://thesource.com/2014/03/04/interview-w-up-and-coming-artist-sy-ari-da-kid/|title=Source Exclusive: Interview with Up And Coming Artist Sy Ari Da Kid|last=DodgerOnDeck|date=March 4, 2014|website=The Source|access-date=June 23, 2016}}</ref>

In late 2015, rumours circulated that Brockington was ghost writing for Canadian rapper [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]]. After releasing a song with Quentin Miller, who [[Meek Mill]] exposed as a co-writer for Drake, Brockington was forced to distance himself from the suggestions.<ref name=":0" />
