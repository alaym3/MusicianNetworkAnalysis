== DJ Mag controversy ==
Between 2006 and 2013 Gareth Emery ranked in DJ Mag's Top 50 DJs in the world, peaking at No. 7 in 2010.<ref name=":1" /> However, in 2013, he publicly denounced the poll due to the huge marketing budgets involved, asking fans no longer to vote for him, and donated his marketing budget to charity instead:<blockquote>"So here's an alternative Top 100 message: Don't vote for me. Seriously, when you buy a ticket to see me in a club, I consider that a vote. When you blast my music in your car, or share it on Facebook, or tell your friends about it, that's a vote too. Those votes, and the amazing support you've shown over the last year, is what matters to me."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/garethemery/posts/10151476089447273|title=Gareth Emery - Just took a bizarre unsolicited phone call... {{!}} Facebook|website=www.facebook.com|access-date=15 May 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206212940/https://www.facebook.com/garethemery/posts/10151476089447273|archive-date=6 December 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref></blockquote>This move was covered by many dance music blogs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.edmtunes.com/2013/07/nope-gareth-emery-doesnt-want-your-dj-mag-vote/|title=[Update] Nope, Gareth Emery Doesn't Want Your DJ Mag Vote...But He Does Want Your Vote On A Charitable Donation. - EDMTunes|last=Fritsch|first=Matt|date=21 July 2013|website=EDMTunes|language=en-US|access-date=15 May 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160611125303/http://www.edmtunes.com/2013/07/nope-gareth-emery-doesnt-want-your-dj-mag-vote/|archive-date=11 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.youredm.com/2015/07/07/why-you-should-be-completely-ignoring-dj-mags-top-100-list/|title=Why You Should Be Completely Ignoring DJ Mag's Top 100 List|last=Rubinstein|first=Peter|date=8 July 2015|website=Your EDM|access-date=15 May 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602170931/http://www.youredm.com/2015/07/07/why-you-should-be-completely-ignoring-dj-mags-top-100-list|archive-date=2 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/laidbackluke/status/359056775070228482|title=Laidback Luke on Twitter|website=Twitter|access-date=15 May 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826112531/https://twitter.com/laidbackluke/status/359056775070228482|archive-date=26 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Podcast and SiriusXM show==
Since March 2006, Emery has produced the 'Gareth Emery Podcast'.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gareth Emery Podcast |url=http://www.garethemery.com/podcast/podcast_174/ |publisher=Gareth Emery.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415140547/http://www.garethemery.com/podcast/podcast_174 |archive-date=15 April 2012 |df=dmy-all |access-date=2 April 2012 }}</ref> It has been nominated for "Best Podcast" at the Miami [[Winter Music Conference]]'s International Dance Music Awards three times.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gareth Emery |url=http://www.enhancedmusic.com/artists/2983 |publisher=Enhanced Music |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330102742/http://www.enhancedmusic.com/artists/2983 |archive-date=30 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In July 2012, Emery launched a syndicated radio show in North America called 'Gareth Emery Presents' on the SiriusXM channel Electric Area (Channel 52). The show is broadcast at 5pm ET Fridays with a repeat at 8pm ET Tuesdays.<ref name="sirius">{{cite web |title=SiriusXM Electric Area |url=http://www.siriusxm.com/electricarea |publisher=Gareth Emery.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208140330/http://www.siriusxm.com/electricarea |archive-date=8 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In November 2014, Emery announced that Episode 310 would be the final episode of the "Gareth Emery Podcast". He explained on social media:

<blockquote>"After doing the show more or less every week since 2006 I guess I'd become a bit too comfortable, and I sometimes felt like I was producing the show on auto pilot for the last year or so. Saying the same old **** and playing the same sounding music, and probably playing it a bit too safe, choosing the obvious bangers and hot promos rather than pushing myself to dig out those hidden gems like I always used to.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gareth Emery Facebook |url=https://www.facebook.com/garethemery/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140520151314/https://www.facebook.com/garethemery |archive-date=20 May 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>"</blockquote>

Emery then followed up with an announcement of a new podcast from his new SiriusXM show called "ELECTRIC FOR LIFE"<ref>{{cite web |title=Emery Launches New Podbast |url=http://www.msopr.com/press-releases/gareth-emery-launches-new-podcast-electric-for-life-with-los-angeles-palladium-show-broadcast-this-saturday-november-22/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141202075719/http://www.msopr.com/press-releases/gareth-emery-launches-new-podcast-electric-for-life-with-los-angeles-palladium-show-broadcast-this-saturday-november-22/ |archive-date=2 December 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> In May 2015, Gareth Emery partnered with Electronic Music lifestyle brand Electric Family to produce a collaboration bracelet for which the proceeds are donated to his charitable foundation, Electric For Life.
