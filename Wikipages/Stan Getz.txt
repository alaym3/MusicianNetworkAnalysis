'''Stanley Getz''' (February 2, 1927 – June 6, 1991) was an American [[jazz]] [[Saxophone|saxophonist]], professionally known as '''Stan Getz'''. Playing primarily the [[tenor saxophone]], Getz was known as "The Sound" because of his warm, lyrical tone, with his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, [[Lester Young]]. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with [[Woody Herman]]'s big band, Getz is described by critic [[Scott Yanow]] as "one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists".<ref name=ALLMUSIC>{{cite web|last=Yanow |first=Scott |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/stan-getz-mn0000742899/biography|title=Stan Getz |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=November 23, 2014}}</ref> Getz performed in [[bebop]] and [[cool jazz]] groups. Influenced by [[João Gilberto]] and [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], he popularized [[bossa nova]] in the United States with the hit single "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]" (1964).

==Early life==
Stan Getz was born on February 2, 1927, at St. Vincent's Hospital in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|pages=518/9}}</ref> Getz's father Al was born in [[Mile End]], London, in 1904, while his mother Goldie (née Yampolsky) was born in Philadelphia in 1907. His paternal grandparents Harris and Beckie Gayetski were originally from the [[Kiev]] area of the [[Russian Empire]] (now [[Ukraine]]) but had migrated to escape the anti-[[Jewish]] [[pogroms in the Russian Empire]] to [[Whitechapel]], in the [[East End of London]]. While in England they owned the Harris Tailor Shop at 52 [[Oxford Street]] for more than 13 years. In 1913, Harris and Beckie emigrated to the United States with their three sons Al, Phil, and Ben, following their son Louis Gayetski who had emigrated to the US the year before.

The Getz family first settled in Philadelphia, but during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] the family moved to New York City, seeking better employment opportunities. Getz worked hard in school, receiving straight A's, and finished sixth grade close to the top of his class. Getz's major interest was in musical instruments and he played a number of them before his father bought him his first saxophone at the age of 13. Even though his father also got him a clarinet, Getz instantly fell in love with the saxophone and began practicing eight hours a day.

Getz attended [[James Monroe High School (New York City)|James Monroe High School]] in the Bronx. In 1941, he was accepted into the All City High School Orchestra of New York City. This gave him a chance to receive private, free tutoring from the New York Philharmonic's [[Simon Kovar]], a  [[bassoon]] player. He also continued playing the saxophone. He eventually dropped out of school in order to pursue his musical career but was later sent back to the classroom by the school system's truancy officers.<ref name="ALLMUSIC" />

==Career==
===Beginnings===
In 1943, at the age of 16,<ref name="Pbs.org">[https://www.pbs.org/jazz/biography/artist_id_getz_stan.htm Pbs.org] "Oxford University Press" PBS – ''Jazz'' – A film By Ken Burns</ref> he joined [[Jack Teagarden]]'s band and, because of his youth, he became Teagarden's ward.<ref name="Larkin"/> Getz also played along with [[Nat King Cole]] and [[Lionel Hampton]]. A period based in Los Angeles with [[Stan Kenton]] was brief. Following a comment from Kenton that his main influence, [[Lester Young]], was too simple, he quit.<ref name="nyt-obit">{{cite news|last1=Watrous|first1=Peter|title=Stan Getz, 64, Saxophonist, Dies; A Melodist With His Own Sound|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/07/obituaries/stan-getz-64-saxophonist-dies-a-melodist-with-his-own-sound.html|date=7 June 1991|access-date=29 May 2021}}</ref> After performing with [[Jimmy Dorsey]], and [[Benny Goodman]], Getz was a soloist with [[Woody Herman]] from 1947 to 1949<ref name="Larkin"/> in "The Second Herd", and he first gained wide attention as one of the band's saxophonists, who were known collectively as "[[Four Brothers (jazz standard)|The Four Brothers]]"; the others being [[Serge Chaloff]], [[Zoot Sims]] and [[Herbie Steward]].<ref name="Pbs.org"/> With Herman, he had a hit with "[[Early Autumn (song)|Early Autumn]]" in 1948.<ref name="nyt-obit" />

After Getz left "The Second Herd" he was able to launch his solo career.<ref name="Larkin"/> [[Horace Silver]]'s trio was heard by Getz as the guest soloist at Hartford, Connecticut's Club Sundown in 1950 and he hired them for touring gigs, gaining Silver his earliest national exposure.<ref>{{cite news|last=Atkins|first=Ronald|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/19/horace-silver|title=Horace Silver obituary|work=The Guardian|date=19 June 2014|access-date=May 30, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Wilson|first=John S.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/20/arts/with-horace-silver-his-piano-and-his-memories.html|title=With Horace Silver, His Piano and His Memories|work=The New York Times|date=February 20, 1981|access-date=May 30, 2021}}</ref> For an unknown period, Silver was not paid by Getz, who was using the money due the pianist to buy heroin. Silver finally left in June 1952.<ref>{{cite news|last=Myers|first=Marc|url=https://news.allaboutjazz.com/stan-getz-horace-silver?width=1024|title=Stan Getz + Horace Silver|work=All About Jazz|date=March 5, 2020|access-date=May 30, 2021}}</ref> In the same period, Getz performed with pianists [[Al Haig]] and [[Duke Jordan]] and drummers [[Roy Haynes]] and [[Max Roach]], as well as bassist [[Tommy Potter]], all of whom had worked with Charlie Parker. Guitarists [[Jimmy Raney]] and [[Johnny Smith]] were also associated with the saxophonist in this period. His profile was enhanced by his featured performance on Johnny Smith's version of the song "[[Moonlight in Vermont (song)|Moonlight in Vermont]]", recorded in 1952, which became a hit single and stayed on the charts for months.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Moonlight in Vermont: The Official Biography of Johnny Smith|last = Flanagan|first = Lin|publisher = Centerstream Publishing|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-57424-322-2|location = Anaheim Hills|page = 43}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Schneider|first=Eric  |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/moonlight-in-vermont-mw0000430436 |title=Moonlight in Vermont - Johnny Smith, Johnny Smith Quintet|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=August 18, 2015}}</ref> A ''[[DownBeat]]'' readers' poll voted the single as the second best jazz record of 1952.<ref>{{cite news|last=Enright|first=Ed|url=https://downbeat.com/news/detail/guitarist-johnny-smith-dies-at-90|title=Guitarist Johnny Smith Dies at 90|work=DownBeat|date=June 17, 2013|access-date=May 28, 2021}}</ref> The later album ''[[Moonlight in Vermont (album)|Moonlight in Vermont]]'', reconfigured from two 10 inch LPs for a 12 inch release, was issued in 1956.

===Return to United States===
Returning to the U.S. from Europe in 1961, Getz recorded the album ''[[Focus (Stan Getz album)|Focus]]'', with arrangements by [[Eddie Sauter]] who created a strings backing for the saxophonist. In a March 2021 article for the [[All About Jazz]] website, Chris May wrote of it as "one of the great masterpieces of mid-twentieth century jazz" and compared it to the work of [[Béla Bartók]].<ref>{{cite news|last=May|first=Chris|url=https://www.allaboutjazz.com/eddie-sauter-a-wider-focus-eddie-sauter?width=1024|title=Eddie Sauter: A Wider Focus|work=AllAboutJazz|date=March 22, 2021|access-date=May 29, 2021}}</ref>

Getz became involved in introducing [[bossa nova]] music to the American audience.<ref name="Larkin"/> Teaming with guitarist [[Charlie Byrd]], who had just returned from a [[U.S. State Department]] tour of Brazil, Getz recorded ''[[Jazz Samba]]'' in 1962. Getz won the [[Grammy Awards of 1963|Grammy for Best Jazz Performance of 1963]] for "[[Desafinado]]", from ''Jazz Samba''. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> His second bossa nova album, also recorded in 1962, was ''[[Big Band Bossa Nova (Stan Getz album)|Big Band Bossa Nova]]'' with composer and arranger [[Gary McFarland]]. As a follow-up, Getz recorded the album, ''[[Jazz Samba Encore!]]'', with one of the originators of bossa nova, Brazilian guitarist [[Luiz Bonfá]]. It also sold more than a million copies by 1964, giving Getz his second gold disc.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs"/>

He then recorded the album ''[[Getz/Gilberto]]'', in 1963,<ref name="ReferenceA">page 208 of "italic" The Latin Beat "italic" by Ed Morales</ref> with [[Antônio Carlos Jobim]], [[João Gilberto]] and his wife, [[Astrud Gilberto]]. Their recording of "[[The Girl from Ipanema]]" won a [[Grammy Award]]. ''Getz/Gilberto'' won two Grammys (Best Album and Best Single). A live album, ''[[Getz/Gilberto Vol. 2]]'', followed, as did ''[[Getz Au Go Go]]'' (1964), a live recording at the [[Cafe au Go Go]]. While still working with the Gilbertos, he recorded the jazz album ''[[Nobody Else But Me (album)|Nobody Else But Me]]'' (1964), with a new quartet including [[vibraphone|vibraphonist]] [[Gary Burton]], but [[Verve Records]], wishing to continue building the Getz brand with bossa nova, refused to release it. It came out 30 years later, after Getz had died.

===Later career===
In 1972, Getz recorded the jazz fusion album ''[[Captain Marvel (album)|Captain Marvel]]'' with [[Chick Corea]], [[Stanley Clarke]] and [[Tony Williams (drummer)|Tony Williams]], and in this period experimented with an [[Echoplex]] on his saxophone. He had a cameo in the film ''[[The Exterminator]]'' (1980).

In the mid-1980s, Getz worked regularly in the San Francisco Bay area and taught at [[Stanford University]] as an artist-in-residence at the [[Stanford Jazz Workshop]] until 1988. In 1986, he was inducted into the ''Down Beat'' [[Down Beat|Jazz Hall of Fame]]. During 1988, Getz worked with [[Huey Lewis and the News]] on their ''[[Small World (Huey Lewis and the News album)|Small World]]'' album. He played the extended solo on part 2 of the title track, which became a minor hit single.

His tenor saxophone of choice was the [[Selmer Mark VI]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Dad Katie 1987 Lincoln Center2.jpg|thumb|With his granddaughter Katie in 1987 at the [[Lincoln Center]]]]
Getz married Beverly Byrne, a vocalist with the [[Gene Krupa]] band, on November 7, 1946, in Los Angeles; the couple had three children, Steve, David and Beverly. As a teenager, Getz had become involved with drugs and alcohol. In 1954, he was arrested for attempting to rob a pharmacy for [[morphine]]. As he was being processed in the prison ward of [[Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center]], Beverly gave birth to their third child one floor below.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

Getz was divorced from Byrne in Mexico in 1956, after which, due to Byrne's own addictions, she was unable to take care of the children. Eventually, the children were rescued and awarded by the Court to Getz's second wife, Monica Silfverskiöld,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lunduniversityfoundation.org/about/monica-getz|title=Monica Getz|website=Lund University Foundation|publisher=Lund University Foundation|access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref> daughter of a Swedish physician and former Olympic medalist, [[Nils Silfverskiöld]], and Swedish Countess [[Mary von Rosen]]. Monica had insisted on raising the family together, as the children had been divided among family members, and eventually, they raised five children: Steven, David, Beverley, Pamela, and Nicolaus, the last two of which were from their own marriage. The couple lived in Copenhagen, Denmark, partly to escape the prevalence of drugs in America at the time. Monica would also become Stan's manager and a major influence in his life.

In 1962, Monica returned with the family to Sweden, after having discovered Stan's recurring addictions. During the following period, as he was trying to persuade her to come back, he sent her two test pressings, one of which, ''Jazz Samba'' with [[Charlie Byrd]], was pivotal to her plans for the next record, ''Getz/Gilberto''. However, Getz's association with Byrd soured, due to a lawsuit initiated by Byrd,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Adler|first=David R.|title=Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd: Give the Drummer Some|url=https://jazztimes.com/features/profiles/stan-getz-and-charlie-byrd-give-the-drummer-some/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=JazzTimes|language=en-US}}</ref> made him apprehensive.

After Getz promised to stay clean and sober, Monica returned from Sweden with the family. On November 21, 1962, Brazil sent scores of musicians to [[Carnegie Hall]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Performance History Search|url=https://www.carnegiehall.org/About/History/Performance-History-Search|access-date=2020-06-04|website=www.carnegiehall.org|language=en}}</ref> as a result of the [[Bossa nova|Bossa Nova]] craze created by ''Jazz Samba'',<ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-02-13|title=How Brazil's bossa nova made it to America|url=https://jazz.fm/how-brazils-bossa-nova-became-all-the-rage-in-60s-america/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=JAZZ.FM91|language=en-CA}}</ref> which in turn, had improved the economy of Brazil. Monica, who was told by Gilberto and Jobim that Getz had been an invisible partner in their creating of the Bossa Nova, by superimposing Getz's Jazz harmonies and sound on the old Samba, suggested a unification of the three. [[Antônio Carlos Jobim|Jobim]] and [[João Gilberto|Gilberto]] reacted with deference and enthusiasm. Getz was reluctant, at first, as he had heard the two were "difficult". Getz had reportedly said that he was convinced, when Monica retorted "Well, don't ''you'' have a reputation for being difficult?" They would become very close friends during the recording of ''Getz/Gilberto'', and Gilberto would even move in with the Getzes, occasionally joined by the children of his own two marriages and his second wife, [[Miúcha|Miucha]].

In the early 1980s, Getz again relapsed into his addictions, resulting in an arrest with an illegal gun in the home with Monica and some of the children. This resulted in an [[Order of protection|Order of Protection]], issued in her favor, which contained a clause that Getz must be sober to be allowed into the house and an [[Court order|Order]] he go to treatment. As a countermove, Getz filed for divorce from Monica in 1981,<ref name="nyt-divorce-contest">{{cite news|last1=Margolick|first1=David|date=26 November 1990|title=Ex-Wife of Stan Getz Testing a Divorce Law|work=[[The New York Times]]|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/26/nyregion/ex-wife-of-stan-getz-testing-a-divorce-law.html?pagewanted=1|access-date=24 March 2015}}</ref> but the couple reconciled at his insistence in 1982 and signed a Reconciliation Agreement, in which they agreed to jointly buy a house they found in [[San Francisco]]. Soon after, however, Getz relapsed. After a second illegal gun/cocaine incident, Monica returned to their New York home. At this time, she discovered the need for the courts to learn about addictions, and she founded the National Coalition for Family Justice<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home Page|url=http://ncfj.org/Home_Page.html|access-date=2020-06-04|website=ncfj}}</ref> in 1988, around the time a divorce was finalized. In 1990, Monica Getz petitioned the [[United States Supreme Court]] to have their divorce verdict overturned, although they declined.<ref name="nyt-obit" /> His ultimately terminal cancer was diagnosed in 1987; he died in June 1991.<ref name="nyt-obit" />

[[Zoot Sims]], who had known Getz since their time with Herman, once described him as "a nice bunch of guys", alluding to the wide range of his personality.<ref name="nyt-obit" />

Getz died of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] on June 6, 1991.<ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1991/06/07/jazz-great-stan-getz-dies-at-64/18e163a7-f398-4df7-97b0-ccdfa4271dd2/ Jazz Great Stan Getz dies at 64 - The Washington Post, article published on June 6, 1991.
