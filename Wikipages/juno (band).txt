'''Juno''' was an [[United States|American]] [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]] in 1995. They released two studio albums, disbanding in 2003.

==Career==

Juno released their debut album '' This Is the Way It Goes and Goes and Goes'' as a co-release on [[DeSoto Records]] and [[Pacifico Records]] on March 30, 1999. Their second album ''A Future Lived in Past Tense'' was released May 8, 2001 on [[Desoto Records]]. The band was critically acclaimed by various local and national music journals, and toured throughout the US, Europe and Japan. The band also released a split EP with [[The Dismemberment Plan]] on [[Desoto Records]] which included a cover of DJ Shadow's "High Noon".

The band is now officially defunct. Founding member Travis Saunders the bassist left the band in 2000. They had played with and auditioned a few different bassists (including [[Nate Mendel]] of [[Foo Fighters]], [[Sunny Day Real Estate]] and [[Nick Harmer]] of [[Death Cab for Cutie]]), but ultimately decided that they were going in different directions artistically.

Currently some of the former members are working on Ghost Wars, a recording project led by Carstens and Eric Fisher.<ref>[http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/2006/07/ghost_wars.php Carstens interview in ''The Stranger''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130428062856/http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/2006/07/ghost_wars.php |date=2013-04-28 }}</ref>
