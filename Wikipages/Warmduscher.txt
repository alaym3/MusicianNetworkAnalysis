'''Warmduscher''' are a [[London]]-based [[post-punk]] band formed in 2014 and currently signed to [[Bella Union]].

==Background==
"The offspring of a match made in hell between Fat White Family and Paranoid London", Warmduscher are Clams Baker Jr (Craig Louis Higgins Jr), Lightnin’ Jack Everett (Jack Everett), Quicksand (Adam J Harmer), Mr. Salt Fingers Lovecraft (Ben Romans-Hopcraft) and The Witherer aka Little Whiskers (Quinn Whalley). Formed on New Year's Eve 2014 as an impromptu band to play at a house party, the initial line up featured Higgins on vocals and Harmer on drums alongside Saul Adamczewski and Lias Kaci Saoudi of [[Fat White Family]] on bass and guitar respectively. The group then continued as a quintet, with Everett (drums), Romans-Hopcraft (bass) and Whalley (noise/electronics) replacing Harmer and Saoudi.<ref name="LTW-150805">{{cite web |url=http://louderthanwar.com/warmduscher-khaki-tears-album-review-2/ |title=Louder Than War Album Review |date=5 August 2015 |last=Gillespie |first=Roxy |website=Louderthanwar.com |accessdate=6 February 2018 }}</ref><ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/18527-warmduscher-interview|title=Hang Yourself: An Interview With WARMDÜSCHER |date=11 August 2015|last=Dickson|first=William|website=Thequietus.com|accessdate=6 February 2018}}</ref> [[Clash (magazine)]] called the group "the sleaziest, most debauched, and downright addictive experiences in London's guitar underground right now".<ref name="CM-180406">{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/news/you-need-this-new-warmduscher-track-in-your-life|title=

==Trivia==
The name "Warmduscher" is German and literally translated means "warm showerer" (somebody who showers with warm water). The made-up term colloquially refers to somebody who is perceived to be a bit too soft for something specific or not hard enough for life in general, a wimp or a pansy. It would be used as in: "You're a warmduscher, mate!"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/warmduscher/a-6615919|title=Warmduscher {{!}} DW {{!}} 12.09.2011|website=DW.COM|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref>
