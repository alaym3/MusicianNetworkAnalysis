Pat's first major recording project. The first demo was primarily solo, being just acoustic guitar played atop of programmed drums. The group quickly expanded and became entirely acoustic. Johnny Hobo toured extensively during their career, often Pat would be the only touring member. Alcohol, drug use, homelessness, politics, suicide, and the punk scene were common themes in Johnny Hobo songs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/41252/Johnny-Hobo-and-the-Freight-Trains-Love-Songs-For-The-Apocalypse/|title=Who needs drugs?

With the ending of Johnny Hobo, Pat continued writing songs and formed Wingnut Dishwashers Union. Similar to Johnny Hobo, Wingnut Dishwashers Union toured constantly, often just with Pat. In contrast to Johnny Hobo, many songs used electric rather than acoustic guitar. They released three full-length albums, two splits, and a compilation during their two-year career, in addition to a solo rendition of their debut album by Pat. Their song topics diverged slightly from Johnny Hobo and the Freight Trains with a more hopeful view of the future.<ref name=":0" /> Wingnut Dishwashers Union broke up when Pat entered rehab at the end of 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sophiesfloorboard.blogspot.com/2016/03/wingnut-dishwashers-union.html|title=Wingnut Dishwashers Union|last=McCormack|first=Kevin|date=10 March 2016|website=Sophie's Floorboard|access-date=2 February 2018}}</ref>

Shortly after leaving rehab, Pat moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]] and began writing new material about political agitation and his battles with drug addiction. Most of these songs were used with the band Ramshackle Glory. However, during Ramshackle Glory's hiatus, Pat began focusing on a solo path. In 2012 he started releasing new solo music. From the beginning of 2014 till his retirement Pat was touring frequently as a solo act.<ref name=":2" /> After his South Eastern United States tour in October 2015, Pat announced that he would be taking a long break from shows and touring though he would be releasing a final album with Ramshackle Glory. In February 2016, Pat announced that he would be ending his music career altogether, stating a recent drastic change in political views and identity in contrast to his former persona as "Pat the Bunny", as well as general disaffiliation with the punk community as the primary factors.<ref name=":1" />
