==History==
===1995–2000: Early years and formation===
The first incarnation of what would eventually become Biffy Clyro was formed in 1995, when fifteen-year-old [[Ayr]]-based guitarist [[Simon Neil]] started playing his songs with friend Kilmarnock-born [[Ben Johnston (Scottish musician)|Ben Johnston]]. Ben's twin brother, [[James Johnston (Scottish musician)|James Johnston]] was soon brought in, and the three spent the next two years rehearsing, writing and covering songs. On 31 January 1995, they played their first gig under the name "Skrewfish" as the support for a band called Pink Kross at the Key Youth Centre in [[East Kilbride]], now known as Universal Connections East Kilbride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.biffierthanthou.com/archives/1995/01/index.html |title=January 1995 Archive |publisher=BiffierThanThou.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014124714/http://biffierthanthou.com/archives/1995/01/index.html |archive-date=14 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref> In 1997, the trio moved to Glasgow, where Neil went to the [[University of Glasgow]], and the Johnston twins went to [[Stow College]], studying Electronics with Music and Audio Engineering, respectively.<ref name="Beggars.bio">{{cite web |url= http://www.beggars.com/us/biffyclyro/index.html |title= Biffy Clyro Biography |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20020919184125/http://www.beggars.com/us/biffyclyro/index.html |archive-date= 19 September 2002 |df= dmy-all }} on [[Beggar's Banquet Records|Beggar's Banquet USA]]</ref>

Bahl offered them a chance to release an independent single on [[Aereogramme]]'s Babi Yaga record label: "[[Iname (song)|Iname]]" was released on 28 June 1999, with Northsound Radio's [[Jim Gellatly]] (later of [[Galaxy Scotland|Beat 106]] & [[Galaxy Scotland|Xfm Scotland]]) giving the band their first radio play. This first release led to the band being chosen by Stow College's [[Electric Honey (label)|Electric Honey]] record label to release a record: ''[[thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow]]'' was released on Nerosa on 13 June 2000, receiving airplay from [[BBC Radio Scotland]] DJ [[Vic Galloway]].<ref name="Yahoo.bio"/> A few days prior to the release of ''thekidswhopoptodaywillrocktomorrow'', the band were spotted at the Unsigned Bands stage at [[T in the Park|T in the Park 2000]] by a [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]] representative, and were signed to the [[Independent record label|independent]] Beggar's Banquet soon thereafter.

===2001–2005: ''Blackened Sky'', ''The Vertigo of Bliss'' and ''Infinity Land''===
{{Mainarticle|Blackened Sky|The Vertigo of Bliss|Infinity Land}}
On 9 April 2001, the previously unreleased "[[27 (song)|27]]" was released as a single. On 1 October 2001, a song from ''thekidswho...'' was re-recorded and released as a single, "[[Justboy]]"; this was repeated again on 4 February 2002, when the song "[[57 (song)|57]]" was released. On 11 March, the band's debut album, ''[[Blackened Sky]]'', was released to generally positive reviews. It was around this time that the band began touring extensively, including supporting [[Weezer]] on 20 March at the [[Barrowland Ballroom|Barrowlands]] in [[Glasgow]].<ref name="Yahoo.bio"/> On 15 July, the fourth single from the album, "[[Joy.Discovery.Invention]]", was released as a double A-side with a newly recorded song called "[[Toys, Toys, Toys, Choke, Toys, Toys, Toys]]" (which would later also appear on their next album ''[[The Vertigo of Bliss]]'').

They toured as part of the [[Kerrang]] tour in 2001 alongside [[Sunna (band)|Sunna]] and [[Hell Is for Heroes (band)|Hell is For Heroes]]; followed by a their first UK wide headline tour later on in the year.

In 2003, the band retreated to the [[Linford Manor]] recording studio in [[Great Linford]], [[Milton Keynes]], England, to record the follow-up to ''Blackened Sky''. On 24 March, a new single was released called "[[The Ideal Height]]", followed by a further new single "[[Questions and Answers (Biffy Clyro song)|Questions and Answers]]" on 26 May. The band's second album, ''[[The Vertigo of Bliss]]'' was released on 16 June, to positive reviews which focused on the more experimental style of the album in comparison to ''Blackened Sky'', as well as the introduction of string sections.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/7231 | title=''The Vertigo of Bliss'' Review | publisher=[[Drowned in Sound]] | access-date=8 June 2007 | archive-date=26 May 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526181325/http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/7231 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

After touring relentlessly for ''The Vertigo of Bliss'', the band retreated to [[Monnow Valley Studio]] in [[Monmouth]], Wales to record a follow-up album. As with the previous album, two singles were released before the actual album: "[[Glitter and Trauma]]" and "[[My Recovery Injection]]" on 9 August and 20 September respectively. An additional [[music download|digital download]] was also released on 31 May, called "[[There's No Such Thing as a Jaggy Snake]]". On 4 October, the band's third album, ''[[Infinity Land]]'' was released, followed by the final single from the album, "[[Only One Word Comes To Mind]]", on 14 February 2005. On 16 February, the band performed a cover of [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand's]] "[[Take Me Out (song)|Take Me Out]]" live from [[Maida Vale]] on [[Zane Lowe]]'s [[BBC Radio 1]] show.

Simon Neil's side project [[Marmaduke Duke]] also released an album in 2005, known as ''The Magnificent Duke''. He toured the UK together with the Johnston twins accompanying on bass and drums.

===2006–2008: ''Puzzle'' and mainstream success===
{{Mainarticle|Puzzle (Biffy Clyro album)}}
In 2006, Biffy Clyro left Beggars Banquet and signed a deal with 14th Floor, an offshoot of [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros]]. In September, the band went to Canada to record their fourth album at [[The Warehouse Studio]] in Vancouver (where it was engineered by [[Mike Fraser (record producer)|Mike Fraser]]), and The Farm Studio in [[Gibsons, British Columbia|Gibsons]]. From these sessions the song "[[Semi-Mental]]" was released as a digital download on 25 December. On 5 March 2007 "[[Saturday Superhouse]]" was released, reaching No.&nbsp;13 on the [[UK Singles Chart]].

''[[Puzzle (Biffy Clyro album)|Puzzle]]'' was released in June and helped the band to reach their highest [[UK Albums Chart]] position ever, hitting No.&nbsp;2 in the first week of release, also reaching No.&nbsp;17 in Ireland, and No.&nbsp;39 in the overall world charts. The album is certified Gold in the UK, having sold over 220,000 copies, and as of February 2009 has sold over 300,000 worldwide.<!--.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq%3Dsearch_plat%26r_id%3D32947  |access-date=26 August 2008 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ref is dead??? --> This album is notable for having somewhat more straightforward song structures and a more melodic overall sound than their previous work, while still retaining some more unusual elements.<ref>{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1027347|pure_url=yes}}|title=Puzzle > Overview | publisher=Rovi Corporation | access-date=9 May 2010}}</ref> ''Puzzle'' was voted the best album of 2007 by [[Kerrang!]] and [[Rock Sound]]. On 25 August, it was announced that "[[Machines (Biffy Clyro song)|Machines]]" would be the next single from ''Puzzle'', which was released on 8 October.

Support slots for acts such as [[Muse (band)|Muse]] (at the new [[Wembley Stadium]]), [[The Who]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were significant in expanding Biffy's fan base. The band also played the [[Download Festival|Download 2007]], [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury 2007]], [[Reading and Leeds Festival]] and [[T in the Park]] for a record seventh time. The band opened for [[Linkin Park]] during January on their European tour. In 2008, the band toured with [[Queens Of The Stone Age]] on their European and North American tours for [[Era Vulgaris]], and opened for New Jersey rockers [[Bon Jovi]] at Twickenham during the [[Lost Highway Tour]]. In December 2008 the band played their biggest headline shows, including a date at Glasgow's 10,000 capacity [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SECC]].

===2008–2010: ''Only Revolutions''===
{{Mainarticle|Only Revolutions (album)}}
[[File:Biffy Clyro 001.jpg|thumb|right|Lead singer [[Simon Neil]] performing live with the band in 2008]]
The band released a new single entitled "[[Mountains (Biffy Clyro song)|Mountains]]" in July 2008, which reached No.&nbsp;5 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] – the band's first song to reach the top 10, and their highest charting single to date. "Mountains" would later be included on their new album.

In an interview with the ''NME'', the band stated that they had started work on a follow up to ''[[Puzzle (Biffy Clyro album)|Puzzle]]'', with Simon Neil saying that the album would include some of the band's "heaviest riffs to date". In an interview with XFM, Ben Johnston revealed that the forthcoming album would be "Oli Coates", and that they already had 16 demos laid down. Simon Neil told Kerrang magazine about the new album on 8 December, playfully saying "The soft bits are softer, and the hard bits are harder...", mocking how bands always label their new albums the most heavy and yet melodic so far. The band worked with ''Puzzle'' producer Garth Richardson once again at [[Ocean Way studios]]. Many videos were shown on the internet of them playing along to [[Shania Twain]]'s "[[You're Still the One]]". A ''[[Kerrang!]]'' article, published in March 2009, stated that they planned to enter the studio in April, revealing a working title for the upcoming album: "Boom, Blast and Ruin". A series of weekly updates on their official site slowly revealed letters of the new album title, and, after ''[[Rock Sound]]'' mistakenly revealed the album's name as "Only Exceptions", it was officially announced that the album would be titled ''Only Revolutions''.

In July 2009, ''Kerrang!'' reported that they were filming the video for the first single from the album, "[[That Golden Rule]]". It was filmed on 1 July in London, with the band saying that the song is "like [[Kyuss]] and [[Tool (band)|Tool]] playing with some Scottish freaks screaming over the top of it." "That Golden Rule" got its first play on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show on 8 July, playing the song twice in a row; it was then announced that the single would be released on 23 August 2009. It went on to reach No.&nbsp;10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Just before the official release of "[[That Golden Rule]]", Biffy Clyro performed on the main stage at [[V Festival]], their second appearance at the festival (the first time being in 2006, in a much earlier slot; during their set on the Chelmsford leg, the band experienced power failures twice during the opening song "[[Glitter and Trauma]]").

"[[The Captain (Biffy Clyro song)|The Captain]]" was released as a single on 26 October 2009, following its first radio play on Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show on 8 September. ''[[Only Revolutions (Biffy Clyro album)|Only Revolutions]]'' was released on 9 November 2009. On 24 February 2010, "[[The Captain (Biffy Clyro song)|The Captain]]" won an NME Award for Best Video.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/biffy-clyro/49951|title=Biffy Clyro win Best Video prize at Shockwaves NME Awards}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.promonews.tv/2010/02/26/andy-morahans-biffy-clyro-wins-best-video-at-nme-awards/ |title=Biffy Clyro win Best Video prize at Shockwaves NME Awards |access-date=2 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412121716/http://www.promonews.tv/2010/02/26/andy-morahans-biffy-clyro-wins-best-video-at-nme-awards/ |archive-date=12 April 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/biffy-clyros-delight-as-they-land-best-1051524|title=Biffy Clyro's delight as they land best video award at NME awards|date=25 February 2010|website=Dailyrecord.co.uk|access-date=2020-06-05}}</ref>

Biffy Clyro were confirmed to be supporting [[Muse (Band)|Muse]] for 14 dates on their European tour, including Wembley Stadium on 11 September, performing after [[I Am Arrows]] and [[White Lies (band)|White Lies]].

The band announced that 2015 would be their 'year off.' In an interview with 3FM in June 2014, Neil stated that "[the band] will take a quiet year next year and disappear so people don't get sick of the lovely Biffy." In the same interview he stated that they were working on about 19 new songs, but felt it was too early to play them live. He confirmed that a new album was coming, most likely towards the end of 2015. [[File:Biffy Clyro Rock Im Park 2016 (12 von 15).jpg|thumb|right|Johnston performing with Biffy Clyro at Rock im Park, 2016]]The first single "Wolves of Winter" was exclusively played as Hottest Record on Monday 21 March 2016 on Radio 1.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07417nf|title=Biffy Clyro + Power Down Playlist, Annie Mac – BBC Radio 1|website=BBC|access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref> On Monday 21 March 2016, during the live premiere of "Wolves of Winter" on Hottest Record on Beats 1, [[Zane Lowe]], Neil announced that the band's new album would be titled [[Ellipsis (Biffy Clyro album)|''Ellipsis'']]. The album, due for release on 8 July 2016, was made available to pre-order in a limited edition box set on the Biffy Clyro web store.

''Ellipsis'' was released on 8 July 2016, entering the UK charts at No. 1. Following the successful launch of ''Ellipsis'', the band performed co-headline slots (co-headlining with [[Fall Out Boy]]) at the [[Reading & Leeds]] festival. The new ''Ellipsis'' songs featured prominently in the setlist. Between the two headline slots, Biffy Clyro also performed a huge outdoor show in Glasgow, with [[Fall Out Boy]] filling in as the support act. In November 2016, Biffy Clyro were announced as the Saturday headliners of the [[Download Festival]] 2017. This marked their sixth appearance at the festival and their first headline performance on the main stage.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://downloadfestival.co.uk/news/announcing-system-down-biffy-clyro-and-aerosmith-and-more |title=Archived copy |access-date=8 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430205207/http://downloadfestival.co.uk/news/announcing-system-down-biffy-clyro-and-aerosmith-and-more |archive-date=30 April 2017 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

To coincide with these headline performances, a U.K. arena tour was announced with [[Brand New (band)|Brand New]] announced as the support act. The tour culminated in a performance at London's O2 arena, in December 2016.
In February 2017, Biffy Clyro performed at the Shepherd's Bush Empire as part of Brit's Week to raise money for charity [[War Child (charity)|War Child]]. To celebrate such an intimate performance at this point in their career, the band performed as their own support act with Simon Neil announcing "we are Biffy Clyro, circa 2003 to 2005", and they played an hour long set of material from their first three albums.

On 27 May 2017, Biffy Clyro performed to 25,000 people at the Radio 1's Big Weekend Hull 2017.  The band also performed at Glastonbury on Sunday 25 June 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05574b7|title=Biffy Clyro, 2017, Glastonbury – BBC Music|website=BBC}}</ref>

== Artistry ==
=== Name ===
The band have never disclosed where the name "Biffy Clyro" originated, and Simon Neil has said that it was "a stupid name" that was often "awkward" to explain its origins when the band started and when not many had heard their music.<ref name="France24evejackson">[http://www.france24.com/en/20100831-2010-08-31-1714-wb-en-culture-Biffy-Clyro-Simon-Neil Simon Neil meets with Eve Jackson]. France 24. 1 September 2010.</ref> Whilst being interviewed on [[Soccer AM]], the band said that they make up stories about how they are named because they are bored with being asked the same question. Among the conflicting answers the band have given are:

*In a Soccer AM interview, the band stated that they named themselves after a footballer named Biffy Clyro who played for [[South Ayrshire]] football club [[Ayr United F.C.|Ayr United]], 
*Another story is that the band members were thinking about manufacturing [[Cliff Richard]] merchandise and they thought about the [[Laszlo Biro]] pen and thought of "Cliffy Biro" that was then accidentally [[spoonerism|spoonerised]] on a drunken night out to 'Biffy Clyro'.<ref name="France24evejackson"/>
*Another interview claims that the name Biffy Clyro comes from an acronym for "Big Imagination For Feeling Young 'Cos Life Yearns Real Optimism".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://faceculture.ad2stream.com/index.php?cnti_key=11734221|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303181438/http://faceculture.ad2stream.com/index.php?cnti_key=11734221|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 March 2016|title=Biffy Clyro – 2007 – IX|access-date=25 July 2008|publisher=FaceCulture Online Multimedia Magazine}}</ref>

*On [[Off the Ball (radio series)|Off the Ball]] in August 2011, Ben Johnston said "Well it's a marriage of two words: Biffy is in fact the nickname of [[Wilfred Dunderdale|the spy who the James Bond novels were based on]] and Clyro is [[Clyro|a village in Wales]] where both our families … used to go on holiday …".<ref>{{cite episode

* ''<nowiki/>'Mon the Biffy!'' or, in more recent times, ''<nowiki/>'Mon the Biff!'', are well known chants among Biffy Clyro fans,<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.nme.com/reviews/biffy-clyro/7258 |title=Biffy Clyro – Glasgow Barfly | date=2 November 2003 | journal=NME}}</ref> usually shouted in between songs at gigs, or before the band comes on stage.

===Musical influences===
The band cite influences ranging from [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands such as [[Metallica]] to [[progressive rock]] band [[Rush (band)|Rush]], while reviewers are often quick to link their sound to [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Foo Fighters]] – particularly in their use of shifting dynamics, which they adapted from [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]] and [[Fugazi]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://www.screendaily.com/news/rock-band-biffy-clyro-reveal-film-project-balance-not-symmetry-exclusive/5129147.article|title=Rock band Biffy Clyro reveal film project 'Balance, Not Symmetry'|date=11 May 2018|website=Screen Daily|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807005855/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/news/local/12544/Biffy-Clyro-heads-to-Australia.htm|archive-date=7 August 2008|access-date=3 December 2018}}</ref>
