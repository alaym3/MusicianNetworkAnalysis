'''Caroline Elizabeth Polachek'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1269616-Caroline-Polachek|title=Caroline Polachek|website=[[Discogs]]|access-date=2017-09-07}}</ref> (born June 20, 1985) is an American singer and songwriter. Raised in Connecticut, Polachek co-founded the [[indie pop]] band [[Chairlift (band)|Chairlift]] while studying at the [[University of Colorado]]. The duo emerged from the late-2000s Brooklyn music scene with the [[sleeper hit]] "Bruises".

During her time in the band, she worked on the solo projects '''Ramona Lisa''' and '''CEP''' before embarking on a career under her own name after Chairlift's disbandment in 2017. Her debut studio album, [[Pang (album)|''Pang'']] (2019), featured collaborations with producer [[Danny L Harle]] and was released to critical acclaim.

Polachek has worked extensively with other artists, collaborating with [[Dev Hynes|Blood Orange]], [[Fischerspooner]], [[Sbtrkt]], [[Charli XCX]], and the British music collective [[PC Music]], and penning material for [[Beyoncé]] ("[[No Angel (Beyoncé song)|No Angel]]"), [[Travis Scott]], and [[Superfruit (duo)|Superfruit]].

I don't think any of the tools that I'm using are particularly new—a lot of the MIDI instruments have been around for 15 years—but the compositions make them sound less electronic, more mysterious."<ref name="p4k update" /> The record was made entirely on Polachek's laptop without instruments or external microphones, except to capture field recordings of the sounds she heard in her surroundings.<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/features/interviews/interview-caroline-polachek-of-chairlift-and-ramona-lisa-2014|title = Caroline Polachek of Chairlift and Ramona Lisa: "I don't want to work things out with anyone, I just wanna do it exactly the way I feel"|date = June 18, 2014|website = thelineofbestfit.com|publisher = The Line Of Best Fit|last = Hannah|first = Andrew}}</ref> She sang vocals directly into her computer's built in microphone, making use of hotel closets, quiet airport gates, and spare dressing rooms during Chairlift's world tour.<ref name="p4k update" /> The album artwork was shot by New York photographer Tim Barber.<ref name=NYT/>

She followed up with a statement on Twitter saying "This speaks not to the artists or their music, but to the politics of the festival and self-congratulatory PR. To do this without permission from the artists on display is exploitative and unprofessional", adding "Moogfest, and all other festivals, simply have a responsibility to position inclusivity as normal".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/caroline-polachek-pulls-out-of-moogfest-2018-over-lineup-announcement/|title=Caroline Polachek Pulls Out of Moogfest 2018 Over Lineup Announcement|date=December 6, 2017|author=Michelle Kim|publisher=Pitchfork|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>
