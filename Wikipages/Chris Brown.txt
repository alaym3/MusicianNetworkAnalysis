==Career==

===2002–2004: Career beginnings===
At age 13, Brown was discovered by Hitmission Records, a local production team that visited his father's gas station while searching for new talent.<ref name="us">{{cite web|title=Celebrity Bios – Chris Brown|work=[[Us Weekly]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]]|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/chris_brown_profile|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080401030734/http://www.usmagazine.com/chris_brown_profile|archive-date=April 1, 2008|access-date=October 11, 2008}}</ref> Hitmission's Lamont Fleming provided voice coaching for Brown, and the team helped to arrange a demo package, under the name of "C.

Reid]], who offered to sign him that day, but Brown refused his proposal. "I knew that Chris had real talent," says Davis. "I just knew I wanted to be part of it."<ref name="SFGate">{{cite news|title=Brown runs with it|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|work=San Francisco Chronicle|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/01/PKG5ULA4C41.DTL&type=music|date=October 1, 2006|access-date=May 28, 2009 | first=Lee| last=Hildebrand}}</ref>

The negotiations with Def Jam continued for two months, and ended when Davis lost her job due to a corporate merger. Brown asked her to be his manager, and once Davis accepted, she promoted the singer to other labels such as [[Jive Records]], [[J-Records]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]]. According to [[Mark Pitts]], in an interview with [[HitQuarters]], Davis presented Brown with a video recording, and Pitts' reaction was: "I saw huge potential ... I didn't love all the records, but I loved his voice.

Brown stated, "I picked Jive because they had the best success with younger artists in the pop market, [...] I knew I was going to capture my African American audience, but Jive had a lot of strength in the pop area as well as longevity in careers."<ref name="SFGate"/> Brown said that during his permanence in [[Harlem]], when he was trying to get his music heard by major labels, his artistic intention was to both rap and sing on his records, but [[Jive Records|Jive]] convinced him to stick to just singing, because he said that "it wasn't acceptable yet" for an R&B singer to also rap on records.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6P0NDXgFqo|title=FULL INTERVIEW Chris Brown on Ebro in the Morning!|access-date=November 7, 2021|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

When the album's lead single, "[[Wall to Wall (song)|Wall to Wall]]", was released, it didn't have a great commercial success, peaking at number 79 on US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart, and number 22 on the US [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart, being his lowest charting single at the time. However, "[[Kiss Kiss (Chris Brown song)|Kiss Kiss]]", featuring and produced by [[T-Pain]], released as the album's second single, received huge success, reaching number one on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, and becoming Brown's second number one single following "Run It!" in 2005. "[[With You (Chris Brown song)|With You]]", produced by [[Stargate (record producers)|Stargate]] (duo of producers known at the time for their work with R&B singer [[Ne-Yo]]), was released as the third single from ''Exclusive'', had even bigger success than "Kiss Kiss", becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|all-time best-selling singles]], and reaching number two on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart. ''Exclusive'' was released in the United States on November 6, 2007. The album is musically R&B, having slight pop influences that were absent in the previous [[hip hop soul]]-influenced disc, reaching a big international success. The album debuted at number four on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, selling 294,000 copies in its first week,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1047319/jay-z-leapfrogs-eagles-britney-for-no-1-debut|title=Jay-Z Leapfrogs Eagles, Britney For No. 1 Debut|website=Billboard|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> and received generally positive reviews from music critics.<ref name="Metacritic">{{Cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/person/chris-brown|title=Chris Brown|website=Metacritic|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> As of March 23, 2011, it has sold over 1.9&nbsp;million copies in the United States.<ref name="albumsales">{{cite web|last=Grein |first=Paul |url=http://new.music.yahoo.com/blogs/chart_watch/74345/week-ending-march-20-2011-songs-the-chris-brown-matter/ |title=Week Ending March 20, 2011: Songs: The Chris Brown Matter |publisher=[[Yahoo!

===2009–2010: ''Graffiti'' and mixtapes===
{{main|Graffiti (Chris Brown album)}}
[[File:Elephant Man ^ Usher - panoramio.jpg|left|thumb|Brown with [[Usher (musician)|Usher]] and [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]] at the [[Reggae Sumfest]] in 2010]]

In 2008, Brown began work on his third studio album, to be called ''[[Graffiti (Chris Brown album)|Graffiti]]'', promising to experiment with a different musical direction inspired by singers [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Michael Jackson]]. He stated, "I wanted to change it up and really be different. Like my style nowadays, I don't try to be typical urban. I want to be like how Prince, Michael and [[Stevie Wonder]] were. They can cross over to any genre of music."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/Entertainment/celebrity/Articles/Chris-Browns-close-Rihanna-860312740.html|title=Chris Brown's close Rihanna|date=June 27, 2008|publisher=[[ITV.com]]|access-date=May 27, 2009}}</ref> Following the domestic violence scandal involving the singer and [[Rihanna]] on February 8, 2009, the majority of media took positions against the singer, significantly reducing the strong rotation of his hits. The incident also caused Brown to lose significant commercial contracts, including one with [[Doublemint]]. The singer later participated in numerous television appearances during the year to express himself publicly about it. ''Graffiti'' 's lead single "[[I Can Transform Ya]]" was released on September 29, 2009. The song peaked at number 20 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, and number 11 on the US Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. "[[Crawl (Chris Brown song)|Crawl]]" was released as the album's second single on November 23, 2009. The song reached number 53 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. ''Graffiti'' was then released on December 8, 2009, featuring an R&B sound mixed with [[Eurodisco]] and rock. Brown, with this album, started to take full control of his art, managing the artistic direction, and writing every song of the album (with the exception of the song "I'll Go", written and produced by [[Brian Kennedy (record producer)|Brian Kennedy]] and [[James Fauntleroy]]). Brown started to be the only artistic director of all his future projects. He said that his decision to entirely direct and write his albums and songs came from the fact that he wanted to give "my own perspective of the music I wanted to make" and by his wanting to "verbalize whatever I was going through". The album, compared to its two precessors, was a commercial and critical failure, debuting at number 7 on the US ''Billboard'' 200 chart, selling 102,000 copies in its first week,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/266379/no-stopping-susan-boyles-dream-on-billboard-200|title=No Stopping Susan Boyle's 'Dream' On Billboard 200|website=Billboard|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> and receiving generally negative reviews from critics.<ref name="Metacritic"/> Many speculated that ''Graffiti'''s flop was result of the scandal of domestic violence happened that same year. As of March 23, 2011, it has sold 341,000 copies in the United States.<ref name="albumsales"/>

While performing a Michael Jackson Tribute at the 2010 [[BET Awards]], Brown started to cry and fell to his knees while singing Jackson's "[[Man in the Mirror]]".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/viral-videos/957594/chris-brown-cries-during-michael-jackson-tribute-at-bet-awards|title=Chris Brown Cries During Michael Jackson Tribute at BET Awards|website=Billboard|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> The performance and his emotional turmoil resonated with several celebrities present at the ceremony, including [[Trey Songz]], [[Sean Combs|Diddy]] and [[Taraji P.

During 2010 Brown released the 3 free mixtapes ''In My Zone (Rhythm & Streets)'', ''[[Fan of a Fan]]'' (collaborative mixtape with [[Tyga]]), and ''In My Zone 2'', which featured a new style of writing with grown themes, and a different musical style, mixing R&B with hip hop. For the mixtapes he worked with new producers, most notably [[Kevin McCall]]. The mixtapes were highly appreciated by the artist's loyal audience, consolidating it. The single "[[Deuces (song)|Deuces]]", extracted from the ''Fan of a Fan'' mixtape, obtained critical acclaim, also achieving a good success, peaking at number 1 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]]. The song was later remixed by the biggest names in the hip-hop scene of that time, including [[Drake (musician)|Drake]], [[Kanye West]], [[André 3000]], [[Rick Ross]], [[Fabolous]], and [[T.I.]]. He later released the solo track "[[No Bullshit|No BS]]" as his second single from ''Fan of a Fan'', and decided to include the two singles from the mixtape as anticipation singles for his next album.

===2011–2012: ''F.A.M.E.'' and ''Fortune''===

In September 2010 Brown announced his album, F.A.M.E.

The album is considered to be one of Brown's most iconic projects, also being regarded as the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona. To further promote the album, Brown embarked on his [[F.A.M.E. Tour (Chris Brown)|F.A.M.E. Tour]] in Australia and North America.

Brown received six nominations at the [[2011 BET Awards]] and ultimately won five awards, including Best Male R&B Artist, Viewers Choice Award, The Fandemonium Award, Best Collaboration and Video of the Year for "Look at Me Now".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/bet-awards/nominees|title=Winners {{pipe}} BET Awards 2021|website=www.bet.com|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> He also won three awards at the 2011 BET Hip Hop Awards, including the People's Champ Award, Reese's Perfect Combo Award and Best Hip Hop Video for "Look at Me Now".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bet.com/hip-hop-awards/nominees|title=Winners and Nominations {{pipe}} BET Hip Hop Awards 2021|website=www.bet.com|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> At the 2011 [[Soul Train Music Awards]], ''F.A.M.E.'' won Album of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|last=Joseph|first=Justin|url=http://blogs.centrictv.com/music/soulsessions/soul-train-awards-2011-winners/|title=Soul Train Award 2011 Winners|publisher=[[BET Her|Centric]]|date=November 27, 2011|access-date=November 28, 2011}}</ref> The album has also earned Brown three Grammy Award nominations at the [[54th Grammy Awards]] for [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Album|Best R&B Album]], as well as [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance|Best Rap Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Rap Song|Best Rap Song]] for "Look at Me Now".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees |title=Nominees And Winners |publisher=Grammy.com |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/63bRXv6ZA?url=http://www.grammy.com/nominees |archive-date=December 1, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> On February 12, 2012, Brown won the Grammy Award for Best R&B Album.

Originally, Brown wanted ''F.A.M.E.'' to be a [[double-disc]] consistent of 25–30 tracks, but the label was contrary to that. Right before the release of ''F.A.M.E.'' Brown decided to follow his intentions in an acceptable way for the label, working on a sequel of ''F.A.M.E.'' called ''Fortune'', that would be a whole new album that contained new material and even some tracks that didn't make the cut of the previous album, releasing it six months after it.<ref name="doubledisc">{{cite news|url=http://www.rttnews.com/Story.aspx?type=ent&Id=1518201|title=Chris Brown Considers Releasing F.A.M.E.

By April 9, 2018, the video had reached over 100 million views and topped the charts in New Zealand and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/lil-dicky-and-chris-browns-freaky-friday-claims-number-1-on-the-official-singles-chart__22478/|title=It's Freaky Friday!

After drafting the concept for his new album, in August 2018, at the end of the "Heartbreak On A Full Moon tour", Brown started the actual processing work of his ninth album, ''[[Indigo (Chris Brown album)|Indigo]]''. On January 4, 2019, Brown released "[[Undecided (Chris Brown song)|Undecided]]", the first single off it, alongside a video for the song. "Undecided" saw Brown reunite with producer [[Scott Storch]], who previously worked with Brown in 2005 on his breakout hit "[[Run It!]]". The single marked Brown's first release after signing an extension and a new [[Music licensing|license agreement]] with [[RCA Records]], that gave him the owning of his master recordings, making him one of the youngest artists to do so at the age of 29.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/01/chris-brown-signs-new-deal-rca-records/|title=Chris Brown Signs New Deal With RCA Records, Owns Masters – XXL|last=II|first=C.

==Artistry==
===Influences===
[[File:Michael Jackson1 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Jackson]] in 1988. He is cited as the main inspiration for Brown to make music.]]

Brown has cited a number of artists as his inspiration, predominantly [[Michael Jackson]].

=== Musical style ===
Music critics have commended Brown's introduction to [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]], recognizing his versatility, and considering him an evolver of the genre. [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'s Iyana Robertson says "As traditional R&B flourished around him, the young singer began an evolution of the genre". She saw his debut single "[[Run It!]]" as a "prelude to what Brown would continue to do for the next decade: relentlessly disrupt the constructs of [[rhythm and blues]]." By his second album ''[[Exclusive (album)|Exclusive]]'', she says he was "tapping more [[Electronic music|electric up-tempos]], swimming deep in [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] waters and annihilating the pop arena". Describing the [[Grammy Award]] winning ''[[F.A.M.E. (Chris Brown album)|F.A.M.E.]]'' as "his most diverse offering to date", she remarked "There was no level of musical flexibility comparable. There still isn't."<ref name="auto2">{{cite news|title=In 10 Years, Chris Brown Single-Handedly Transformed R&B |url= http://www.vibe.com/featured/chis-brown-10th-anniversary/| work=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]| access-date= May 31, 2016}}</ref> ''F.A.M.E.'' is considered to be the album that defined Brown's musical style and persona.<ref name="Jones">Jones, Steve (March 22, 2011).

====Genres====
[[File:ChrisBrown2016.jpg|thumb|left|Brown in 2016]]

Brown made his sound mixing the traditional sound of R&B adding different influences to it, most importantly [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and pop, but also several other genres in different songs, such as [[Soul music|soul]], [[dancehall]], [[alternative R&B]], [[House music|house]], [[Electronic dance music|EDM]], [[afropop]], [[Trap music|trap]], rock, [[disco]] and [[funk]]. The multitude of genres influencing his music can be heard in many of his singles, like "[[Deuces (song)|Deuces]]", "[[Sweet Love (Chris Brown song)|Sweet Love]]", "[[Liquor (song)|Liquor]]", "[[Zero (Chris Brown song)|Zero]]", "[[Back to Love (Chris Brown song)|Back to Love]]" or "[[Don't Check on Me]]". His pure side of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] is densely shown on every album that he has done, even after that his music started to be more tinged from other genres, with some examples being "[[No Bullshit|No BS]]", "[[Don't Judge Me]]", "[[Back to Sleep (song)|Back To Sleep]]" and "[[Privacy (song)|Privacy]]".

Throughout his career Brown has always had a strong influence from [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in his music,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/hub/categories/full-series|title=Full Series - Categories|website=ITV Hub|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://globalgrind.com/category/entertainment/music/|title=Music|website=Global Grind|access-date=November 7, 2021}}</ref> and after his 2010 mixtapes, he approached the genre differently, starting to rap frequently on mixtapes and features, adding to his albums straight hip-hop songs like "[[Look at Me Now (Chris Brown song)|Look at Me Now]]", "[[Till I Die (Chris Brown song)|Till I Die]]" and "[[Loyal (Chris Brown song)|Loyal]]", or by doing performances that switch from his R&B singing to his rapping, like he did in several tracks from his album ''Heartbreak on a Full Moon''.  His [[dance-pop]] side in the single "[[Forever (Chris Brown song)|Forever]]" off his second album ''Exclusive'' opened the door for many other [[Europop]] songs like "[[Yeah 3x]]", "[[Beautiful People (Chris Brown song)|Beautiful People]]", "[[Turn Up the Music (Chris Brown song)|Turn Up The Music]]" and "[[Don't Wake Me Up (song)|Don't Wake Me Up]]", but it begun to be less present in his music starting from his album ''[[X (Chris Brown album)|X]]''.<ref name="apnews.com">{{Cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/c50de9d46932477eb90a32e63da323d4|title = Chris Brown's 45-song album not the skip-fest you'd expect|date = November 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, he said during an interview for ''[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]'', that God is the only thing that he's afraid of. Speaking about prayers he said "I pray everyday, I think we pray unconsciously too. Personally I don't pray for success. I pray for knowledge for understanding and peace of mind. I really try to pray for that because it's a big world, and you can get wrapped up in it trying to please every city. So I just try to get a peace of mind and me understanding that being at peace with my flaws and my talents. I'm cool with that. That's why I think once He shows me certain things, or even the choices that I make, and decisions that I make that are healthy for me. He shows me the right path. When I bless other people, He always blesses me. It's not even about a self-serving journey; it's about just learning. I want to learn people's experiences. I want to give them experiences too."
