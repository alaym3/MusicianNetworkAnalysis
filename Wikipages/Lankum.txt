In 2018 they were named Best Folk Group at the [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] Folk Music Awards, while Radie Peat was named Best Folk Singer.<ref name="rte">{{cite web |url=https://journalofmusic.com/news/radie-peat-lankum-emma-langford-we-banjo-3-among-winners-rte-folk-awards|work=[[The Journal of Music]] |title=Radie Peat, Lankum, Emma Langford, We Banjo 3 Among Winners at RTÉ Folk Awards|date=26 October 2018|accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref> The band were nominated for the RTÉ [[Choice Music Prize]] Irish Album of the Year in 2017 for their album ''Between the Earth and Sky'', and won the prize in 2019 for their album ''The Livelong Day''.<ref name="choiceprize">{{cite web |url=http://www.choicemusicprize.ie/2020/03/05/winners-rte-choice-music-prize-2019/|work=[[RTÉ Choice Music Prize]] |title=Winners - RTÉ Choice Music Prize 2019|date=5 March 2019|accessdate=10 October 2021}}</ref>

== History ==
The group were originally known as Lynched, after the brothers' surname, and released their debut album ''Cold Old Fire'' (2014) under that name. In October 2016 they announced in a statement that they were changing their name to Lankum to avoid associations with the practice of [[lynching]]. The statement read: "We will not continue to work under our current name while the systemic persecution and murder of black people in the USA continues."<ref name="lynched">{{cite web|date=16 January 2017|title=We have changed our name|url=https://lynchedmusic.com/news/|work=Lynched official website|accessdate=28 October 2019}}</ref> The name Lankum comes from the folk ballad "False Lankum", as sung by the [[Irish travellers|Irish traveller]] and folk singer [[John Reilly (singer)|John Reilly]].<ref name="lynched" />

In 2017, the band signed to [[Rough Trade Records]] and recorded their album ''Between The Earth and Sky'', to analogue tape with producer/ engineer [[Julie McLarnon]].  It was released on 27 October 2017 and subsequently nominated for [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]]. ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' named it folk 'album of the year' 2017.{{fact|date=February 2020}}

In 2019, Lankum’s video for ''The Young People'', directed by filmmaker [[Bob Gallagher (filmmaker)|Bob Gallagher]],<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 November 2019|title=Bob Gallagher and Lankum win Best Irish Music Video at Irish Film Festival London|url=https://www.imro.ie/industry-news/bob-gallagher-and-lankum-win-best-irish-music-video-at-irish-film-festival-london/|website=Imro.ie}}</ref> won Best Irish Music Video Award at the Irish Film Festival in [[London]], England.

== Notes ==
:{{note label|a|NB}} Ian and Darragh Lynch released ''Where Did We Do Wrong?!'' in 2003 as ''Lynched.'' However, it seems that this incarnation of ''Lynched'' is not the same musical project as that of the same name which would go on to become ''Lankum'', as ''Cold Old Fire'', released in 2014 with Cormac Mac Diarmada and Radie Peat, is often described as the group's "debut album".
