'''Bad Religion''' is an American [[punk rock]] band that formed in [[Los Angeles]], California in 1980. The band's lyrics cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their melodic sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple line-up changes, with singer [[Greg Graffin]] being the band's only constant member, though fellow founding members [[Jay Bentley]] and [[Brett Gurewitz]] have also been with the band for most of their history, and guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] has been a member of the group since 1994. Guitarist [[Mike Dimkich]] and drummer [[Jamie Miller (US musician)|Jamie Miller]] have been members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/178220/9 |title=Bad Religion Announce Shows In Manchester And London |publisher=Stereoboard UK |date=April 4, 2013 |access-date=April 4, 2013}}</ref> having sold over five million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cduniverse.com/search/xx/music/pid/2047332/a/Tested:+Live.htm |title=Bad Religion Tested: Live CD |publisher=Cduniverse.com |date=July 15, 2002 |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>

After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label [[Epitaph Records|Epitaph]] in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major label [[Atlantic Records|Atlantic]] in 1993, and along with [[Punk rock in California|California-based bands]] like [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[NOFX]] and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], they were responsible for the [[Punk rock#Pop-punk and mainstream success|punk rock revival]] movement of the 1990s.<ref name="autobiography">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bad-religions-autobiography-do-what-you-want-due-in-august/|title=BAD RELIGION's Autobiography 'Do What You Want' Due In August|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=January 8, 2020|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref><ref name="theguardian">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/07/its-the-rawness-why-green-day-and-90s-punk-still-resonates-with-todays-young-music-fans|title='It's the rawness': why Green Day and 90s punk still resonates with today's young music fans|work=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=February 7, 2020|access-date=March 13, 2020}}</ref> Atlantic reissued the previously-released on Epitaph album, ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' (1993), which was commercially successful, as was its 1994 follow-up ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger than Fiction]]''.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bad-religion-mn0000062823/awards|title=Bad Religion - Awards|publisher=[[AllMusic|AllMusic.com]]|access-date=October 10, 2015}}</ref> ''Stranger than Fiction'' included some of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including "[[Infected (song)|Infected]]", "[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger than Fiction]]" and the re-recorded version of "[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]",<ref name="allmusic" /> and it was later certified gold, both in the United States and Canada.

Shortly before the release of ''Stranger than Fiction'', Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a full-time basis (in response to the breakout success of one of the label's bands, the Offspring), and was replaced by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]]. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with "[[Sorrow (Bad Religion song)|Sorrow]]", "[[Los Angeles Is Burning]]" and "[[The Devil in Stitches]]" being Top 40 hits on the [[Alternative Airplay|US charts]], and their sixteenth studio album ''[[True North (Bad Religion album)|True North]]'' (2013) becoming Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart, where it peaked at number 19.<ref name="allmusic" /> The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album, ''[[Age of Unreason (album)|Age of Unreason]]'', was released on May 3, 2019,<ref name="blabbermouth">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/bad-religion-to-release-age-of-unreason-album-in-may/|title=BAD RELIGION To Release 'Age Of Unreason' Album In May|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=February 26, 2019|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref> and they are currently working on new material for their eighteenth studio album.<ref name="ew">{{Cite web|title=Bad Religion's Greg Graffin on cramming 40 years of punk-rock chaos into one book|url=https://ew.com/music/bad-religion-interview-do-what-you-want/|website=[[Entertainment Weekly|ew.com]]|date=August 17, 2020|access-date=August 18, 2020}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early recordings (1980–1983)===
[[File:Badreligion1980.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Bad Religion in 1980]]

Their first official show was on November 11, 1980, at Joey Kills Bar in [[Burbank, California]].<ref name="It All Happened">{{cite web|title=The Forms at Joey Kills Bar|url=http://www.itallhappened.com/the-forms-at-joey-kills-bar-1980-11-11|work=It All Happened – A Living History of Live Music|access-date=April 12, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016230629/http://www.itallhappened.com/the-forms-at-joey-kills-bar-1980-11-11|archive-date=October 16, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1981, the band released their initial [[eponymous]] six-song EP as a 7" record on the newly formed label, [[Epitaph Records]], which was and continues to be managed and owned by Gurewitz. Also in 1981, the band began recording their first full-length album, ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'' During the recording of this album, [[drummer]] Jay Ziskrout quit the band, and was replaced by [[Peter Finestone]]. Released in 1982, ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' was also distributed by the band under the Epitaph label, and sold roughly 12,000 copies.<ref name="opiateofthemasses">{{cite news|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/media/item.asp?itemID=112|title=Addicted to the Opiate of the Masses|author=Greene, Jo-Anne.|date=May 23, 1997|work=Goldmine: The Collectors Record and Compact Disc Marketplace}}</ref>

===''Into the Unknown'', ''Back to the Known'' and hiatus (1983–1985)===
In 1983, the band released ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]'', a keyboard-driven [[progressive rock|progressive]] [[hard rock]] album with a slightly slower pace.<ref name="intotheunknown">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/into-the-unknown-mw0000836297|title=Into The Unknown (review)|author=Dougan, John|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=June 23, 2012}}</ref> Almost all of the albums the band produced were sold out of the warehouse they were housed in without the band's knowledge, after which this album went out of print. This incident, as well as band members' increasingly divergent personal lives, led to the band's temporary dissolution shortly after the album's release.<ref name="opiateofthemasses" />

Soon after, Graffin reassembled Bad Religion with [[Circle Jerks]] guitarist [[Greg Hetson]] replacing Gurewitz, who had gone into rehab for his drug problem. Bad Religion returned to a somewhat mellower, [[rock and roll]] version of their original sound with the ''[[Back to the Known]]'' EP. Eventually the band split toward the middle of 1985.

===Reunion, ''Suffer'', ''No Control'', ''Against the Grain'' and ''Generator'' (1986–1992)===
Bad Religion slowly reformed in 1986 out of the ''Back to the Known'' line-up when Graffin called Bentley and asked him to return. Bentley's response was tentative, but after being assured that the setlist consisted mostly of tracks from ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'', he agreed to return for one show, and ended up staying on because he had so much fun. A freshly rehabilitated Gurewitz was eventually convinced to come back aboard, and with Pete Finestone returning on drums and Greg Hetson on second guitar; Bad Religion was back.<ref name="opiateofthemasses" /> This lineup recorded the band's third album, ''[[Suffer (album)|Suffer]]'', which was released in 1988. The album received positive reviews in the independent music press and was voted Best Album of the Year by publications such as ''[[Trust (magazine)|Trust]]'', ''[[Maximumrocknroll|Maximum Rocknroll]]'' and ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=suffer_%28album%29 |title=Suffer (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |access-date=August 11, 2016}}</ref>

During the ''Suffer'' tour in 1988, Bad Religion began writing new material. In early 1989, while the band was on break from touring, they commenced work on their next album, and entered the [[Westbeach Recorders]] studio in June of that year to record it. The resulting album, ''[[No Control (Bad Religion album)|No Control]]'', was released in November 1989, and was Bad Religion's best-selling album at the time, eventually selling more than 80,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=no%5Fcontrol%5F%28album%29 |title=No Control (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>

Bad Religion's hardcore punk style continued with their next album, ''[[Against the Grain (Bad Religion album)|Against the Grain]]'', which was released in 1990. While the album still did not break the band into mainstream audiences, it was the first 100,000 seller, and showed how quickly they were growing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=against_the_grain_(album) |title=Against The Grain (album) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |publisher=Thebrpage.net |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref> "[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]", one of the tracks off the album, is generally regarded as the band's most well-known song, and has been played at almost every live show.

Drummer [[Pete Finestone]] left Bad Religion again in April 1991 to focus on his other band, the Fishermen, which had signed with a major label, and [[Bobby Schayer]] joined the band as his replacement. In May 1991, Bad Religion entered the Westbeach Recorders studio to begin recording material for their sixth studio album, ''[[Generator (Bad Religion album)|Generator]]'', which was not released until March 1992. The album was recorded almost live in the studio,<ref name="Generatorinfo">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=generator_(album)|title=Generator - the album|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=September 12, 2009}}</ref> because, at the time, Gurewitz had moved Westbeach to larger premises, and for the first time, the entire band could play in the studio at the same time. He stated that it was "time to change" and the band "did it in a different studio, but as far as the songwriting, it was a deliberate effort to try something different".<ref name="Generatorinfo" /> To accompany the album, Bad Religion filmed their first music video "[[Atomic Garden (song)|Atomic Garden]]", which was also their first song to be released as a single.

To coincide with the band's success, Bad Religion released a compilation album, ''[[80–85]]'', in 1991. It is a repackaging of their debut album, ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'', their two EPs, ''[[Bad Religion (EP)|Bad Religion]]'' and ''[[Back to the Known]]'' and the band's three track contributions to the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP. This compilation did not include ''[[Into the Unknown (Bad Religion album)|Into the Unknown]]''. ''80–85'' is now out of print and has been replaced by the 2004 re-issued version of ''[[How Could Hell Be Any Worse?]]'' with the same track listings.

===Mainstream success and departure of Gurewitz (1993–1995)===

With [[alternative rock]] and [[grunge]] breaking into the mainstream, Bad Religion signed to [[Atlantic Records]] in 1993 and quickly re-released their seventh full-length studio album ''[[Recipe for Hate]]'' on the label that same year. Despite receiving mixed reviews from music critics, the album finally broke Bad Religion into mainstream audiences and got their highest U.S. chart position to date, debuting at No.&nbsp;14 on [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s [[Top Heatseekers|Heatseekers]] chart, with "[[American Jesus]]" and "[[Struck a Nerve]]" in particular becoming major rock radio hits at their time.

''Recipe for Hate'' was followed up by Bad Religion's eighth studio album ''[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion album)|Stranger Than Fiction]]''. The album met high critical reception upon its release in September 1994, and was their most successful album at the time, scoring such hits as "[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]]", "[[Infected (song)|Infected]]", and a re-recording of "[[21st Century (Digital Boy)]]", which was originally released on ''Against the Grain''. The band also recorded the song "Leaders and Followers" (which later appeared as a bonus track on the Japanese version of ''Stranger Than Fiction'') for the soundtrack for the [[Kevin Smith]] film, ''[[Clerks (1994 film)|Clerks]]''. The album was Bad Religion's first to enter the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]; the release peaked at number 87, and was awarded [[RIAA Certification|gold certification]] on March 4, 1998, for sales of over half a million copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |title=RIAA Certification (type in "Bad Religion" in the artist box) |work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] |access-date=October 11, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626050454/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH |archive-date=June 26, 2007 }}</ref> With the success of that album, Bad Religion became a key member of the 1990s [[Commercial broadcasting|commercial]] punk rock explosion, along with [[Green Day]], [[the Offspring]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[NOFX]].<ref name="autobiography" /><ref name="theguardian" />

Right before the release of ''Stranger Than Fiction'', Gurewitz left the band. He officially cited the reason for his departure as the increasing amount of time he was needed at Epitaph as [[the Offspring]] (who had just released ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'' to unexpected success and acclaim) became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s. Gurewitz, along with many fans, accused the band of [[selling out]] for leaving Epitaph to seek greater financial success.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Neal|title=The Higher Calling|date=May 9, 1996|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050427023721/http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=248&iType=25|archive-date=April 27, 2005}}</ref> As tensions increased, Graffin would sing alternate lyrics during concerts such as "I want to know where Brett gets his crack" or "I want to know why Gurewitz cracked," on the song "[[Stranger than Fiction (Bad Religion song)|Stranger Than Fiction]]".<ref name="strangerthanfiction">{{cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/theanswer/?article=stranger_than_fiction_%28song%29 |title=Stranger Than Fiction (song) &#124; The Answer &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995 |website=Thebrpage.net |access-date=April 27, 2016}}</ref> These barbs referred to Gurewitz's struggles with crack, heroin and other addictions which plagued him for years. Brett discussed his drug use in an interview on the band's ''Suffer Tour'' documentary, ''[[Along the Way]]'', and claimed that he was clean and sober. In response, Gurewitz recorded a song with his new band [[The Daredevils (band)|the Daredevils]] entitled "[[Hate You (Daredevils song)|Hate You]]", reportedly directed towards Jay Bentley.

Gurewitz was replaced as a guitarist by [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]], a former member of the bands [[Minor Threat]], [[Dag Nasty]] and [[Junkyard (band)|Junkyard]]. Baker had declined a spot with [[R.E.M.]] to join Bad Religion.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sharpe-Young|first=Garry|title=New Wave of American Heavy Metal|year=2005|publisher=Zonda Books Limited|isbn=0958268401|page=46}}</ref> Since Greg Graffin and Gurewitz had split songwriting duties, Graffin was now Bad Religion's primary songwriter.

===Post-Gurewitz period, departure of Bobby Schayer (1996–2000)===
Bad Religion continued touring and recording without Brett Gurewitz and released three more albums for Atlantic, starting with ''[[The Gray Race]]'' (1996), produced by former Cars frontman [[Ric Ocasek]]. Despite never garnering the amount of attention that ''Stranger Than Fiction'' received, it would score Bad Religion a minor U.S. radio hit with the song "A Walk" as well as the European release of "Punk Rock Song".

[[File:Badr1995.jpg|thumb|[[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] (left) with Bad Religion live in the Netherlands, 1995]]
In 1998, Bad Religion released their tenth full-length album, ''[[No Substance]]'', produced by [[Alex Perialas]], Ronnie Kimball and the band themselves. Although the album was anticipated by both music critics and fans as a result of the band's previous worldwide successes with ''Stranger Than Fiction'' and ''The Gray Race'', it was given mixed reviews by critics and fans.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r348580|pure_url=yes}} Ankeny, J: "No Substance" review]</ref> Following the release of ''No Substance'', the band embarked on a year-long tour.

In 1999, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin to co-write a song together, called "Believe It", which would appear on their next album, ''[[The New America]]'' (2000). For it, [[Todd Rundgren]], an early musical inspiration for Graffin, was brought in to produce. "Todd was kind of an underground sensation back in 1974. Here's a guy who was making pop music but in a way that you wouldn't hear on the radio. So much of my early musical identity was wrapped up in the way he conducted himself." In the summer of 2000, they set out on a successful 3-month U.S. arena tour opening for [[Blink-182]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thebrpage.net/shows/tour.asp?tourID=33|title=2000 - The Mark, Tom, and Travis Show Tour (supporting Blink 182) &#124; Tours & shows &#124; The Bad Religion Page - Since 1995|website=Thebrpage.net|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref> Interest in recording the record waned, due to Rundgren's poor attitude. Jay Bentley reflects on this by saying, "I didn't feel we were going anywhere and so did Greg. Todd didn't like Greg and that made Greg so mad! He met his idol and he was a jerk! I don't think Todd gave a shit about anything."<ref name="chartattack">{{cite web|url=http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|title=Bad Religion: The Process of Labels|first=Keith|last=Carman|work=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]|date=July 19, 2002|access-date=September 27, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606183720/http://www.chartattack.com/features/1515/bad-religion-the-process-of-labels|archive-date=June 6, 2011}}</ref> However, Graffin later writes in his book, Anarchy Evolution, that although Todd Rundgren was difficult to work with, he and Graffin are friends to this day. Meanwhile, [[Bobby Schayer]] left the band following a serious shoulder injury and was replaced by [[Brooks Wackerman]] ([[Suicidal Tendencies]]).

===Return to Epitaph and reunion with Gurewitz (2001–2004)===
In 2001, Bad Religion departed from Atlantic Records. They returned to Epitaph and Brett Gurewitz rejoined the band. The expanded six-piece line-up then recorded and released ''[[The Process of Belief]]'' (2002). Graffin states, "there was a little bit of disappointment on my part when he left the band, but we never had any serious acrimony between the two of us. I can't say the same for the rest of the band. But he and I, being the songwriters from way back, we really wanted to try again."<ref name="rollingstone">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/badreligion/articles/story/5927776/the_new_state_of_bad_religion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930221821/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/badreligion/articles/story/5927776/the_new_state_of_bad_religion|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 30, 2007|title=The New State of Bad Religion|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard|date=May 11, 2000}}</ref>

Their next album, ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]'', was released in June 2004. Like ''The Process of Belief'', it is widely regarded by fans{{who|date=June 2012}} as a return to the faster punk-style songwriting that some felt was less prominent in the band's music during their time on Atlantic.

In April 2004, the band also re-released digitally-remastered versions of all of their first six studio albums on Epitaph Records (except ''Into the Unknown''). The ''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?'' re-issue, though reclaiming the original title of the band's debut LP, contained all of the same material as the previously issued ''80–85'' compilation, including their first EP, the ''[[Public Service (EP)|Public Service]]'' EP (with different versions of the songs Bad Religion, Slaves, and Drastic Actions than the self-titled EP) and the "Back to the Known" EP. To coincide with the re-issues, they also released their long out-of-print live VHS ''[[Along the Way]]'' on DVD for the first time. Though ''Recipe for Hate'' was released on Epitaph, the album could not be re-issued; due to the fact that it was re-issued on Atlantic, problems with the rights ownership made a re-issue unlikely.

===''New Maps of Hell'' (2005–2008)===
[[File:Bad Religion 2005-6-22.jpg|left|thumb|Bentley (left) and Graffin (right) with Bad Religion live in the House of Blues, 2005]]
On March 7, 2006, a live DVD, ''[[Live at the Palladium (Bad Religion DVD)|Live at the Palladium]]'' was released. This DVD featured a live show performed in late 2004 at the Hollywood Palladium, as well as extensive interviews, several music videos, and a photo gallery. During one of the interview segments, guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] said the band's next album would be a double-length release, but this turned out not to be the case.<ref name="palladium" />

[[Greg Graffin]] released his second solo album, ''[[Cold as the Clay]]'', on July 11, 2006.

Bad Religion's fourteenth studio album, ''[[New Maps of Hell (Bad Religion album)|New Maps of Hell]]'', was released on July 10, 2007.

Despite earlier reports that Bad Religion had been in the studio by mid-2018, and the fact that they had already released a new song, Gurewitz told ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' in July 2018 that, "We're writing for a new album, recording this fall or late summer.

About four months after the release of ''Age of Unreason'', guitarist [[Brian Baker (musician)|Brian Baker]] was asked if Bad Religion was already working on a follow-up album. His response was: "No, I'm not really thinking about a new album right now because this one is still developing and there is a lot of world yet to play. 2020 is going to be a busy year for us, it's our 40th Anniversary year. We have a book coming out at the end of the year – it'll be our first authorized, somewhat participatory, biography of Bad Religion. So there is a lot more to do with this record. The good thing about Bad Religion is that you don't really have to have a new product out to go work. The catalogue we have is so extensive and we are so fortunate to have the fan base that we have. So we don't really worry about a new album cycle, those thing just sort of come when they come. The next one might take four or five years, it might take two, I don't know. It's just about whether songs have come together in a way that is respectful of the Bad Religion standard.

On January 20, 2021, Bad Religion released a previously-unreleased song called "Emancipation of the Mind", which was recorded during the ''Age of Unreason'' sessions.

Unlike many other hardcore bands of the era, they also acknowledged [[proto-punk]] bands like the [[New York Dolls]], [[MC5]] and [[the Stooges]].

[[The Beatles]] were also a huge influence on Bad Religion. The band said the Beatles were about the only band everyone in Bad Religion really liked.

Reviewers have repeatedly cited an ''upbeat'' and positive tone to both the melody and lyrics, even when dealing with dark topics.<ref name="Spin review of True North">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/2013/01/bad-religion-dept-of-false-hope-true-north/ |title=Bad Religion Direct Digital Boy's Lame Dad to the 'Dept.

==Beliefs==
===Politics===
Many of Bad Religion's songs are about different social ills, although they try not to ascribe the causes of these ills to any single person or group. Greg Graffin believes that the current political situation in the United States can make it difficult to voice these concerns, as he doesn't want to feed the polarization of viewpoints.<ref name="Lyxzén">{{cite web|url=http://www.badreligion.com/news/?id=9 |title=Brett Gurewitz Interview |first=Dennis|last=Lyxzén |date=June 29, 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406100750/http://www.badreligion.com/news/?id=9 |archive-date=April 6, 2007 }}</ref>

The band contributed a song to the ''[[Rock Against Bush]]'' series organized by [[Fat Mike]]'s Punkvoter, a political activist group and website whose supporters are primarily [[left-liberal]] members of the punk subculture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.punkvoter.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718095516/http://www.punkvoter.com/|url-status=dead|title=PunkVoter.com - Sign Up|archive-date=July 18, 2014|website=Punkvoter.com|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>

Brett Gurewitz attributed his anger towards former U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] as the major inspiration for ''[[The Empire Strikes First]]''. "Our whole album is dedicated to getting Bush out of office. I'm not a presidential scholar but I don't think you'll find a worse president in the history of the United States. He's probably one of the worst leaders in the history of world leaders. I just hate the guy."<ref name="Lyxzén" /> In a similar fashion, the album ''[[Age of Unreason (album)|Age of Unreason]]'' was inspired by the band's disdain for [[Donald Trump]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/super-powers-and-punk-rock-brett-gurewitz-crosses-mediums-to-spread-important-messages/|title=Super Powers and Punk Rock: Brett Gurewitz Crosses Mediums to Spread Important Messages|first=Brett|last=Callwood|date=July 11, 2018|website=[[LA Weekly]]|access-date=October 18, 2019}}</ref>

Bad Religion performed at [[L7 (band)|L7's]] [[Abortion-rights movements|abortion-rights]] benefit [[Rock for Choice]] at the [[Hollywood Palladium]] on April 30, 1993 with acts such as [[Stone Temple Pilots]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]], [[Bikini Kill]], [[King Missile]], and [[Free Kitten (band)|Free Kitten]] with [[Kim Gordon]]. Hetson wore a Rock for Choice t-shirt often when performing; one example was when the band performed "21st Century (Digital Boy)" on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] in 1994. Bentley has also worn Rock for Choice t-shirts, such as when they performed the [[Phoenix Festival#1993|Phoenix Festival]] in the United Kingdom in 1993. The band's song "Operation Rescue" on ''Against the Grain'' is a pro-choice song (named after [[Anti-abortion movements|anti-abortion]] organization [[Operation Save America|Operation Rescue]]).

Despite the name of the band, or the band's logo, the members do not consider themselves [[antitheist]]. Singer Greg Graffin states that more often than not, the band prefers to use religion as a metaphor for anything that does not allow for an individual's freedom to think or express themselves as they choose. In this way, their songs are more about anti-conformity than anti-religion.<ref name="kellycathy">{{cite web|url=http://thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=327&iType=21 |title=Graffin Interview |date=October 15, 1993 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928003612/http://www.thebrpage.net/article/detail.asp?iArt=327&iType=21 |archive-date=September 28, 2007 }}</ref> Contrary to popular belief, Greg Graffin does not identify himself as an atheist, but chooses to identify as a [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalist]].

{{quote|Wired Magazine came out with a big exposé of "the new atheists". I was interviewed for it—and yet I think I was included as a sidebar but not as a main feature and I think the main reason they did that was because they noticed that I wasn't that happy billing myself as an atheist. To me it just doesn't say that much; it doesn't say much about you. Instead I bill myself as a naturalist, which I think says a lot more. Because a ''naturalist'' is someone who ... first of all—they study natural science, and they have a hopeful message—I think—to send to the world, which is ... we can agree on what the truth is ... and it has to be through experimentation, verification, and new discoveries, followed by more verification. So ... if we can agree on those terms, we can agree that the truth changes, based on new discoveries, and the ''structure'' of science is such that you can never be so sure of something, because a new discovery can rework the framework—it can ''reconstruct'' the framework of your science and you have to look at the world differently. That makes it a very dynamic and exciting place to be. And if you say "you're an atheist", it's not really saying much about how you came to that conclusion. But if you say "you're a naturalist", I think it says something. You've reached that point because you've studied science, because you believe there's a ''fundamental'' way of looking at the world that is part of a long tradition. And so, I prefer naturalist.|Greg Graffin<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwqJ7X6yOaw |title=Greg Graffin acoustic performance and interview at Harvard |publisher=Youtube.com |date=2008-04-28 |access-date=2011-10-15}}</ref>}}

[[File:Crossbuster symbol.svg|thumb|The Crossbuster]]

Bad Religion's logo has been referred to by fans as the "Crossbuster". It features a black [[Latin cross]] with a red [[prohibition sign]] over it. It was created by guitarist [[Brett Gurewitz]] by drawing it on a piece of paper and showing it to the rest of the band.

In the live documentary ''[[Along the Way]]'', Greg Hetson, Greg Graffin and Jay Bentley are all asked the question "What's the meaning of the Bad Religion symbol?".

Hetson: "The meaning of the symbol? It's, to me it's just against any established set of rules, and the church just seemed to be the easiest target. It has a ... you know, the Christian religion has this symbol, it has a bunch of beliefs. They say 'You either believe it or not, this is the way it is' and that's not the way the world works. So, it was just an easy target to use, to be [[anti-establishment]]."

Graffin: "Yeah. When it first came out, we all liked it, you know? We were little kids and we thought 'Yeah, this is a great idea, it'll piss people off.' You know, when you're fifteen years old, the first thing you think about is 'How can I piss people off?', you know? And it's very good to ... it's very easy to piss people off when you're fifteen, especially it's easy to piss off your parents and adults, in general. But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol ... the cross is sort of the international symbol [points to a [[no parking]] sign behind him] as this parking symbol, the no parking is ... everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [''[[sic]]''] showing ... it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad ... it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will ... it's something mankind will ... I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans."

Bentley: "Brett made that when we were fifteen years old. Brett came up with a piece of paper and said 'Look at this!' and, and we all laughed and said 'That's really funny' 'cause the concept of taking that symbol and putting the 'no' thing on top of it was just ... it seemed shocking enough and good enough, because it represented ... sometimes people took it that it represented that we were like Satan worshipers and that we were not liking God, but it was more against, in America, is [''sic''] there's too much TV evangelism, of, you know, 'Send me monies and God will love you', and it's like [scoffs]. So that was, at the time, that was very popular, when we were starting, so that was one of the, one of the things that we still hate the most, is having to pay to be saved in some, like, ridiculous ... you don't need that. You don't need anybody to tell you that you have to pay money. So that was one of the reasons why we did that, and it's just ... it's one of those things that, it happened and we took it and, maybe ... it was a really easy symbol for kids to spray paint and it's an easy symbol to put on a shirt and, so, it became, maybe, bigger than what it really was in the beginning. It was just, it was something that we liked and we thought that it would piss our parents off or something, you know? And then, when the records came out it just came everywhere, and so then everyone said 'What does that mean? What does that mean?' Whatever you want it to mean, you know ... you decide."

Brian Baker, who joined the band later in their career, sums it up as follows:

"The name Bad Religion and the crossbuster logo came to pass in the minds of two fifteen-year-olds who were trying to find the most offensive name and image they could possibly find for the punk band they were starting in their garage ... These are not people who thought that 21 years later they would be on the telephone doing interviews."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.decapolis.com/musicreviews/interviews/badr.shtml |title=NewsPro Archive |publisher=Decapolis.com |date=November 30, 2001 |access-date=October 15, 2011}}</ref>

A lot of Bad Religion [[merchandise]] including hats, belt buckles, t-shirts, and hoodies contain the Crossbuster. The logo was also used on many album covers.
