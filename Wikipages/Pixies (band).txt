The '''Pixies''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band formed in 1986 in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]]. Until 2013, the band comprised [[Black Francis]] (vocals, rhythm guitar, songwriter), [[Joey Santiago]] (lead guitar), [[Kim Deal]] (bass, backing vocals) and [[David Lovering]] (drums). The band disbanded acrimoniously in 1993 but reunited in 2004. After Deal left in 2013, the Pixies hired [[Kim Shattuck]] as a touring bassist; she was replaced the same year by [[Paz Lenchantin]], who became a permanent member in 2016.

The Pixies are associated with the 1990s [[alternative rock]] boom, and draw on elements including [[punk rock]] and [[surf music|surf rock]]. Their music is known for its dynamic "loud-quiet-loud" shifts and song structures. Francis is the Pixies' primary songwriter; his often surreal lyrics cover offbeat subjects such as extraterrestrials, incest, and biblical violence. They achieved modest popularity in the US but were more successful in Europe. Their jarring pop sound influenced acts such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], the [[Smashing pumpkins|Smashing Pumpkins]], and [[Weezer]]. Their popularity grew in the years after their break-up, leading to a 2004 reunion and sold-out world tours.

== History ==

=== Formation (1986) ===
[[File:BlackFrancisTroxy.jpg|thumb|Founding member and principal songwriter [[Black Francis]]]]Guitarist [[Joey Santiago]] and songwriter [[Black Francis]] (born Charles Michael Kitteridge Thompson IV) met when they lived next to each other in a suite while attending the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]].<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies">{{harvnb|Spitz|2004}}</ref> Although Santiago was worried about distractions, he noticed Francis played music and the pair began to jam together.<ref name=ganz>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=11}}</ref> Francis embarked on a student exchange trip to Puerto Rico to study Spanish.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> After six months, he returned to Amherst and dropped out of the university.<ref name=sisario>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=12–13}}</ref> Francis and Santiago spent 1984 working in a Boston-area warehouse, with Francis composing songs on his acoustic guitar and writing lyrics on the subway train.<ref name=ganz2>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=13}}</ref>

The pair formed a band in January 1986.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{harvnb|Erlewine (Pixies Biography)}}</ref> Two weeks later, Francis placed an advertisement seeking a bass player who liked both the folk act [[Peter, Paul and Mary]] and the alternative rock band [[Hüsker Dü]].<ref name=ganz3>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|pp=13–14}}</ref> [[Kim Deal]] was the only respondent, and arrived at the audition without a bass, as she had never played one before.<ref name=ganz4>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=15}}</ref><ref name=sisario2>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=14}}</ref> She was invited to join as she liked the songs Francis showed her. She obtained a bass, and the trio started rehearsing in Deal's apartment.<ref name="Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20">{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20}}</ref>

After recruiting Deal, Kim paid for her sister, [[Kelley Deal]], to fly to Boston and audition as drummer. Though Francis approved, Kelley was not confident in her drumming, and was more interested in playing songs written by Kim; she later joined Kim's band the [[The Breeders|Breeders]].<ref name=Chick>{{harvnb|Chick|2008}}</ref> Kim's husband suggested they hire [[David Lovering]], whom Kim had met at her wedding reception.<ref name=ganz6>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=18}}</ref><ref name=sisario3>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=8–9}}</ref> The group arrived at a name after Santiago selected the word "[[pixie]]s" randomly from a dictionary, liking how it looked and its definition as "mischievous little [[elves]]".<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> The Pixies moved rehearsals to Lovering's parents' garage in mid-1986<ref name="Frank|Ganz|2005|p=20" /> and began to play shows at bars in the Boston area.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

===''Come on Pilgrim'' (1987) ===
While the Pixies were playing a concert with [[Throwing Muses]], they were noticed by producer [[Gary Smith (record producer)|Gary Smith]], manager of [[Fort Apache Studios]].<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> He told the band he "could not sleep until you guys are world famous".<ref name="officialprofile">{{harvnb|Pixies (4AD)}}</ref> The band produced a 17-track demo at Fort Apache soon afterwards, known to fans as the [[Pixies (EP)|''Purple Tape'']] because of the tape cover's purple background. Funded by Francis' father at the cost of $1000, the recording session was completed in three days.<ref name="Sisario, 2006. p. 16">{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=16}}</ref> Local promoter Ken Goes became the band's manager, and he passed the demo to [[Ivo Watts-Russell]] of the independent record label [[4AD]].<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> Watts-Russell nearly passed on the band, finding them too normal, "too rock 'n' roll", but signed them at the persuasion of his girlfriend.<ref name=sisario5>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=17}}</ref>

Upon signing with 4AD, eight tracks from the Purple Tape were selected for the ''[[Come on Pilgrim]]'' mini-LP, the Pixies' first release.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> Francis drew upon his experiences in Puerto Rico, mostly in the songs "Vamos" and "Isla de Encanta", describing the poverty in Puerto Rico and singing in loose Spanish.<ref name="officialprofile"/> The religious lyrics in ''Come on Pilgrim'' and later albums came from his parents' [[born-again Christian]] days in the Pentecostal Church.<ref name="officialprofile"/> Critic Heather Phares sees themes such as sexual frustration ("I've Been Tired") and incest ("Nimrod's Son" and "The Holiday Song") on the record.<ref>{{harvnb|Phares (Come On Pilgrim)}}</ref>

=== ''Surfer Rosa'' and ''Doolittle'' (1988–1989) ===
''Come on Pilgrim'' was followed by the Pixies' first full-length album, ''[[Surfer Rosa]]''. The album was recorded by [[Steve Albini]] (who was hired by Watts-Russell on the advice of a 4AD colleague),<ref name=ganz7>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=75}}</ref> completed in two weeks, and released in early 1988.<ref name="officialprofile"/> ''Surfer Rosa'' gained the Pixies acclaim in Europe; both ''[[Melody Maker]]'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' gave ''Surfer Rosa'' their "Album of the Year" award. American critical response was also positive yet more muted, a reaction that persisted for much of the band's career.<ref name=sisario6>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=19–20}}</ref> The album was eventually certified Gold in the U.S. in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|50 Cent Cashes In}}</ref> After the album was released, the band arrived in England to support Throwing Muses on the European "Sex and Death" tour—beginning at the [[Mean Fiddler]] in London.<ref name=ganz8>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=94}}</ref> The tour also took them to the Netherlands, where the Pixies had already received enough media attention to be headlining the tour. The tour became notable for the band's [[in-joke]]s, such as playing their entire [[set list]] in alphabetical order.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

Meanwhile, the Pixies signed an American distribution deal with major record label [[Elektra Records|Elektra]].<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Around this time, the Pixies struck up a relationship with the British producer [[Gil Norton]]. Norton produced their second full album, ''[[Doolittle (album)|Doolittle]]'',<ref name=carew>{{harvnb|Carew}}</ref> which was recorded in the last six weeks of 1988 and seen as a departure from the raw sound of ''Come on Pilgrim'' and ''Surfer Rosa''. ''Doolittle'' had a much cleaner sound, largely due to Norton and the production budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]40,000, which was quadruple that of ''Surfer Rosa''.<ref name=sisario7>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=47}}</ref> ''Doolittle'' featured the single "[[Here Comes Your Man]]", which biographers Josh Frank and Caryn Ganz describe as an unusually jaunty and pop-like song for the band.<ref name=ganz9>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|pp=118–9}}</ref> "[[Monkey Gone to Heaven]]" was popular on alternative radio in the US, reaching the top 10 on the ''Billboard'' [[Alternative Airplay|Modern Rock Tracks]],<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies: Awards}}</ref> and the single entered the Top 100 in the U.K.<ref>{{harvnb|Roach|2008|p=320}}</ref> Like ''Surfer Rosa'', ''Doolittle'' was acclaimed by fans and music critics alike.<ref name="carew" /> ''Doolittle'' was their first album to enter into the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at 98.<ref name="Billboard 200">{{cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/pixies/chart-history/tlp/|title=Pixies Chart History - Billboard 200|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=2021-03-23}}</ref> In the UK, the album was a commercial success, reaching number 8 in the [[UK Albums Chart|Albums Chart]].<ref name="UK Chart">{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/artist/16940/pixies/|title=Pixies full Official Chart history|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]|access-date=2019-09-21}}</ref>

=== Hiatus (1989–1990) ===
After ''Doolittle'', tensions between Deal and Francis came to a head (for example, Francis threw a guitar at Deal during a concert in [[Stuttgart]]),<ref name=ganz10>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=132}}</ref> and Deal was almost fired from the band when she refused to play at a concert in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name=aston>{{harvnb|Aston|1997}}</ref> Santiago, in an interview with ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'', described Deal as being "headstrong and want[ing] to include her own songs, to explore her own world" on the band's albums; eventually she accepted that Francis was the singer and had musical control of the band, but after the Frankfurt incident, "they kinda stopped talking".<ref name=aston/> The band became increasingly tired during the post-''Doolittle'' "Fuck or Fight" tour of the United States and fighting among members continued.<ref name=carew/> After the tour's final date in New York City, the band was too exhausted to attend the end-of-tour party the following night and soon announced a hiatus.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/>

During this time, Santiago and Lovering went on vacation<ref name=carew/> while Francis performed a short solo tour,<ref name="allmusic-bio"/> made up of a number of concerts to generate gas money as he traveled across the country.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> Deal formed a new band, [[the Breeders]], with [[Tanya Donelly]] of [[Throwing Muses]] and bass player [[Josephine Wiggs]] of Perfect Disaster.<ref name=breedersbiography>{{harvnb|Erlewine (Breeders Biography)}}</ref> Their debut album, ''[[Pod (The Breeders album)|Pod]]'', was released in 1990.<ref name=breedersbiography/><ref>{{harvnb|Phares (Pod)}}</ref>

=== ''Bossanova'' and ''Trompe le Monde'' (1990–1992) ===
[[File:PixiesTicket1990.jpg|thumb|Pixies ticket from October 1, 1990]]In 1990, all members of the group except for Deal moved to Los Angeles.<ref name=ganz12>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=172}}</ref> Lovering stated that he, Santiago, and Francis moved there "because the recording studio was there".<ref name=ganz13>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=74}}</ref> Unlike previous recordings, the band had little time to practice beforehand, and Black Francis wrote much of the album in the studio.<ref name=ganz14>{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|pp=175–76}}</ref> Featuring the singles "[[Velouria]]" and "[[Dig for Fire]]", ''[[Bossanova (Pixies album)|Bossanova]]'' reached number 70 in the United States.<ref>{{harvnb|Billboard 200: Week of September 15, 1990}}</ref> In contrast, the album peaked at number three in the United Kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Roach|2009|p=216}}</ref> Also in 1990, the Pixies released a cover of the [[Paul Butterfield|Paul Butterfield Blues Band's]] "Born in Chicago" on the compilation album ''[[Rubáiyát: Elektra's 40th Anniversary]]''.<ref name=allmu3>{{harvnb|Heilman}}</ref>

The band continued to tour and released ''[[Trompe le Monde]]'' in 1991, their final album before their break-up. The album included "U-Mass", which has been described as being about college apathy,<ref name=magnet>{{harvnb|Fritch|2001}}</ref> and whose guitar riff was written years before at the University of Massachusetts before Francis and Santiago dropped out.<ref name=magnet/> The album also featured a cover of "Head On" by [[the Jesus and Mary Chain]].<ref>{{harvnb|Phares (Trompe le Monde)}}</ref> Also that year, the band contributed a cover of "I Can't Forget" to the [[Leonard Cohen]] [[tribute album]] ''[[I'm Your Fan]]'',<ref>{{harvnb|Erlewine (I'm Your Fan)}}</ref> and began an international tour on which they played stadiums in Europe and smaller venues in the United States. They then signed to be the support act of [[U2]] on the lucrative US leg of the [[Zoo TV Tour]] in 1992.<ref name=barton/> Tensions rose among band members, and at the end of the year, the Pixies went on sabbatical and focused on separate projects.<ref name=barton>{{harvnb|Barton|2005}}</ref>

=== Breakup and solo projects (1993–2003) ===
In early 1993, Francis announced in an interview to [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]] that the Pixies were finished. He offered no explanation at the time, unbeknownst to the other members of the band.<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> He later called Santiago and notified Deal and Lovering via [[fax]].<ref name=sisario8>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=7}}</ref>

After the breakup, the members embarked on separate projects. Black Francis renamed himself Frank Black,<ref>{{harvnb|Erlewine (Frank Black Biography)}}</ref> and released several solo albums, including a string of releases with [[Frank Black and the Catholics]].<ref name=fbatcr>{{harvnb|Frank Black and the Catholics: Releases}}</ref> Deal returned to the Breeders, who scored a hit with "[[Cannonball (Breeders song)|Cannonball]]" from their platinum-selling ''[[Last Splash]]'' in 1993, and released more albums several years later.<ref name="breedersbiography" /> She also formed [[the Amps]], who released one album.<ref name=village>{{harvnb|Grose|2002}}</ref>

Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black albums,<ref name=allmu7>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/frank-black-mw0000095289/credits|title=Frank Black: Credits|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=allmu8>{{cite web|url=https://allmusic.com/album/teenager-of-the-year-r202231/credits|title=Teenager of the Year|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004041305/http://allmusic.com/album/teenager-of-the-year-r202231/credits|archive-date=October 4, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=allmu9>{{cite web|url=https://allmusic.com/album/show-me-your-tears-r652547/credits|title=Show Me Your Tears: Credits|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512210608/http://allmusic.com/album/show-me-your-tears-r652547/credits|archive-date=May 12, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> as well as on other artists' albums.<ref name=allmu10>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/stuff-mw0000028330/credits|title=Stuff: Credits|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 3, 2011}}</ref><ref name=allmu11>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/in-pursuit-of-your-happiness-mw0000451271/credits|title=In Pursuit of Your Happiness: Credits|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 3, 2011}}</ref> He wrote music for the television show ''[[Undeclared (TV series)|Undeclared]]'' and theme music for the film ''[[Crime and Punishment in Suburbia]]''.<ref name=martinis>{{harvnb|News (The Martinis)}}</ref> He formed [[the Martinis]] with his wife Linda Mallari, and released the album ''[[Smitten (The Martinis album)|Smitten]]'' in 2004.<ref name=martinis/> In 2004, he also played lead guitar on the album ''Statecraft'' by the novelist and musician [[Charles Douglas (musician)|Charles Douglas]].<ref>{{harvnb|Weingarten|2004}}</ref> Lovering became a magician and performed a style of magic he called "scientific phenomenalism".<ref name=laweekly>{{harvnb|Albert|2003}}.</ref> He was temporarily a member of the Martinis, and later drummed with the band [[Cracker (band)|Cracker]].<ref name=laweekly/><ref>{{harvnb|Phares (The Martinis: Biography)}}</ref>

[[File:Pixies2009.jpg|thumb|right|Pixies in 2009.]]
In the years following the Pixies' breakup, Black dismissed rumors of a reunion,<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /><ref name=magnet/><ref>{{harvnb|Frank Blacks Out Pixies Reunion}}</ref> but incorporated an increasing number of Pixies songs in his sets with the Catholics,<ref name=mendel>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|2005|pp=152, 168, 191}}</ref> and occasionally included Santiago in his solo work and Lovering's magic show as an opening act to concerts.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> In 2003, a series of phone calls among band members resulted in some low-key rehearsals, and soon the decision to reunite.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> By February 2004, a full tour was announced,<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies to Reunite for Tour – Official!}}</ref> and tickets for nearly all the initial tour dates sold out within minutes.<ref>{{harvnb|Pixies sell out!}}</ref>

In July 2016, the Pixies announced that Lenchantin had become a permanent member of the band, and that their sixth album, ''[[Head Carrier]]'', would release on September 30, 2016.<ref name="P4KHead">{{cite web|last1=Monroe|first1=Jazz|title=Pixies Announce New Album Head Carrier, Share "Um Chagga Lagga": Listen {{!}} Pitchfork|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/63409-pixies-announce-new-album-head-carrier-share-um-chagga-lagga-listen/|website=pitchfork.com|access-date=July 6, 2016}}</ref> Their seventh album, ''[[Beneath the Eyrie]]'', was released on September 13, 2019, backed by lead single "On Graveyard Hill".<ref>{{cite web|last=Childers|first=Chad|date=June 3, 2019|title=Pixies Announce 'Beneath the Eyrie' Album, Reveal 'On Graveyard Hill' Single|url=https://loudwire.com/pixies-beneath-the-eyrie-album-on-graveyard-hill-single/|access-date=June 3, 2019|website=Loudwire}}</ref> The Pixies released a [[podcast]], ''It's a Pixies Podcast'', documenting the recording of the album.<ref>{{harvnb|Shaffer|2019}}</ref>

== Style ==
The Pixies incorporates elements of [[Surf music|surf rock]] and [[punk rock]], with an emphasis on contrasting volume dynamics. ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' described them as "surf music-meets-[[The Stooges|Stooges]] spikiness and oft-imitated stop/start and quiet/loud dynamics".<ref>{{harvnb|Cohen|2002|p=36}}</ref> Their music has also been pictured as "an unorthodox marriage of surf music and punk rock, ... characterized by Black's bristling lyrics and hackle-raising caterwaul, Kim Deal's whispered harmonies and waspy basslines, Joey Santiago's fragile guitar, and the persistent flush of David Lovering's drums."<ref name=barton /> The band's music incorporates extreme dynamic shifts; Francis explained in 1991, "Those are the two basic components of rock music&nbsp;... the dreamy side and the rockin' side. It's always been either sweaty or laid back and cool. We do try to be dynamic, but it's dumbo dynamics, because we don't know how to do anything else. We can play loud or quiet—that's it."<ref name="Guitar Player">{{cite book |title=The Pixies: Gods of Almost Pop. April |first=Joe |last=Gore |year=1991 |publisher=Guitar Player }}</ref>

=== Influences ===
The Pixies are influenced by a range of artists and genres; each member came from a different musical background. When he first started writing songs for the Pixies, Francis says he was listening to nothing but [[Hüsker Dü]], [[Captain Beefheart]], and [[Iggy Pop]];<ref name=sisario9>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=13}}</ref> During the making of ''Doolittle'' he listened heavily to the [[The Beatles|Beatles]]' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]''.<ref name=sisario10>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=48–49}}</ref> He has cited [[Buddy Holly]] as a model for his compressed songwriting.<ref name=sisario11>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=46}}</ref> Francis did not discover [[punk rock]] until he was 16, saying "it was good I didn't listen to these hip records". As a child, he listened mainly to 1960s songs, religious music and [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|Emerson Lake and Palmer]], [...] and [[Talking Heads]], who he says "weren't punk either".<ref>{{harvnb|Barker|2015}}</ref>

Santiago listened to 1970s and 1980s punk including [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]], as well as [[David Bowie]]<ref name="officialprofile" /> and [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Tuffrey|first=Laurie|date=May 22, 2014|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/15323-joey-santiago-pixies-favourite-albumsPlanets?page=11|title=Planets Of Sound: Joey Santiago Of Pixies' Favourite Albums|work=The Quietus|access-date=January 21, 2018|archive-url=https://archive.today/20180808162013/http://thequietus.com/articles/15323-joey-santiago-pixies-favourite-albumsPlanets?page=11|archive-date=August 8, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Guitarists who influenced him include [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Les Paul]], [[Wes Montgomery]], and [[George Harrison]].<ref name=sisario12>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=12, 49}}</ref> Deal's musical background was folk music and [[country music|country]]; she had formed a country-folk band with her sister in her teenage years, and played covers of artists such as [[the Everly Brothers]] and [[Hank Williams]].<ref name=barton /> Other artists Deal listened to included [[XTC]], [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang of Four]] and [[Elvis Costello]].<ref name=rogers>{{harvnb|Rogers|2009}}</ref> Lovering is a fan of the band [[Rush (band)|Rush]].<ref name=barton />

Other media such as film has influenced the Pixies; Francis cites surrealist films ''[[Eraserhead]]'' and ''[[Un chien andalou]]'' (as mentioned in "Debaser") as influences.<ref name="officialprofile" /> He has commented on these influences, saying he "didn't have the patience to sit around reading Surrealist novels", but found it easier to watch twenty-minute films.<ref name=sisario13>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=29}}</ref>

=== Songwriting and vocals ===
Most of the Pixies' songs are composed and sung by Francis. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine has described Francis's writing as containing "bizarre, fragmented lyrics about space, religion, sex, mutilation, and pop culture".<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> Biblical violence is a theme of ''Doolittle''{{'}}s "Dead" and "Gouge Away";<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /><ref name=sisario14>{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|pp=94, 119–120}}</ref> Francis told a ''Melody Maker'' interviewer, "It's all those characters in the [[Old Testament]]. I'm obsessed with them. Why it comes out so much I don't know."<ref name="sisario16">{{harvnb|Sisario|2006|p=18}}</ref> He has described ''Come on Pilgrim{{'}}s'' "Caribou" as being about reincarnation,<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" /> and extraterrestrial themes appear in a number of songs on ''Bossanova''.<ref name="SPIN Life Pixies" />

Deal co-wrote ''Doolittle''{{'}}s "Silver" with Francis,<ref name=doolittle>{{harvnb|Doolittle}}</ref> and they share lead harmony vocals on the track.<ref name="Sisario, 2006. p. 16" /> She also co-wrote and sang lead vocals on ''Surfer Rosa''{{'}}s "Gigantic",<ref name=Chick/><ref name=surferrosa>{{harvnb|Surfer Rosa}}</ref> and is the sole songwriter of the 2004 digital single "Bam Thwok".<ref name=rogers /><ref>{{harvnb|Pixies Pen First New Song In 13 Years}}</ref> She was credited as Mrs. John Murphy on "Gigantic"<ref name=surferrosa />—at the time she was married, and she used this name as an ironic [[Feminism|feminist]] joke.<ref name=sisario16 /> She also sang lead vocals on the song "Into the White" and the [[Neil Young]] cover "I've Been Waiting for You", which were both B-sides.<ref name=b-sides /> Lovering sang lead vocals on ''Doolittle''{{'}}s "La La Love You"<ref name=doolittle /> and the B-side "Make Believe".<ref name=b-sides /> Most recently, Lenchantin made her lead vocal debut on ''Head Carrier''{{'}}s "All I Think About Now".<ref>{{harvnb|Hogan|2016}}</ref> She also provided lead vocals on "Los Surfers Muertos", from 2019's ''Beneath The Eyrie'' and the 2020 September single "Hear Me Out".

== Legacy ==
The Pixies first album ''Surfer Rosa'' is certified gold, while ''Doolittle'' hit platinum status, selling over 1&nbsp;million copies. The band influenced a number of musicians associated with the alternative rock boom of the 1990s.<ref>{{harvnb|Artists: Pixies}}</ref><ref name=egan>{{harvnb|Egan|2009}}</ref> Gary Smith, who produced their ''Come on Pilgrim'', commented on the band's influence on alternative rock and their legacy in 1997:<ref name=egan/>

<blockquote>I've heard it said about [[the Velvet Underground]] that while not a lot of people bought their albums, everyone who did started a band. I think this is largely true about Pixies as well. Charles' secret weapon turned out to be not so secret and, sooner or later, all sorts of bands were exploiting the same strategy of wide dynamics. It became a kind of new pop formula and, within a short while, "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]" was charging up the charts and even the members of Nirvana said later that it sounded for all the world like a Pixies song.</blockquote>

Sonically, the Pixies are credited with popularizing the extreme dynamics and stop-start timing that would become widespread in alternative rock; the Pixies songs typically feature hushed, restrained verses, and explosive, wailing choruses.<ref name=magnet/> Artists including David Bowie, [[Matt Noveskey]], [[Radiohead]], [[PJ Harvey]], [[U2]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[The Strokes]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Weezer]], [[Bush (band)|Bush]], [[Arcade Fire]], [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]], [[Everclear (band)|Everclear]], [[Kings of Leon]] and [[Matthew Good]] have cited admiration of or influence by the Pixies.<ref name=carew/><ref name=rhino>{{cite web|url=http://www.rhinomedia.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=330 |title=The reunion tour of the year has come to DVD |work=Rhino Magazine |date=July 25, 2005 |access-date=September 9, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715181115/http://www.rhinomedia.com/rzine/pressrelease.lasso?PRID=330 |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Erlewine (Weezer Biography)}}</ref><ref name=Alexakis>{{cite web|url=http://magnetmagazine.com/2010/01/19/from-the-desk-of-everclears-art-alexakis-the-pixies%E2%80%99-%E2%80%9Cdoolittle%E2%80%9D/|title=Magnet Magazine|author=Alexakis| access-date=July 28, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Sinclair|2004}}</ref> [[Bono]] of U2 has called the Pixies "one of America's greatest bands ever",<ref name=rhino/> and Radiohead's [[Thom Yorke]] said that the Pixies "changed my life".<ref name=egan/> Bowie, whose own music had inspired Francis and Santiago while they were at university, has said that the Pixies made "just about the most compelling music of the entire 80s."<ref name=rhino/>

One notable citation as an influence was by [[Kurt Cobain]], on influencing Nirvana's "[[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]", which he admitted was a conscious attempt to co-opt the Pixies' style. In a January 1994 interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', he said, "I was trying to write the ultimate pop song. I was basically trying to rip off the Pixies. I have to admit it [smiles]. When I heard the Pixies for the first time, I connected with that band so heavily I should have been in that band—or at least in a Pixies cover band. We used their sense of dynamics, being soft and quiet and then loud and hard."<ref name=egan/><ref>{{harvnb|Dowling|2004}}</ref> Cobain cited ''Surfer Rosa'' as one of his main musical influences, and particularly admired the album's natural and powerful drum sounds—a result of Steve Albini's influence on the record. Albini later produced Nirvana's 1993 ''[[In Utero (album)|In Utero]]'' at the request of Cobain.<ref>{{harvnb|Azerrad|1994|pp=312–313}}</ref>

== Music videos and DVDs ==
No music videos were released from ''Come on Pilgrim'' or ''Surfer Rosa'', but from ''Doolittle'' onwards, the following videos were made: "Monkey Gone To Heaven", "Here Comes Your Man", "Velouria", "Dig For Fire", "Allison", "Alec Eiffel", "Head On", and "Debaser";<ref name=jawetz>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/11535/pixies/|title=Pixies|author=Jawetz, Gil|work=DVD Talk|date=April 27, 2004|access-date=January 23, 2011}}</ref> these were later released on the 2004 DVD ''Pixies''.<ref name=jawetz/> Furthermore, a music video accompanied the release of their 2013 song, "Bagboy", as well an alternate video released on a later date. Videos have been made for all the songs in EP1. The videos for "Here Comes Your Man" and "Allison" were also released on ''The Complete 'B' Sides''.<ref name=b-sides/>

By ''Bossanova'', the band had developed a severe aversion to recording music videos, and Francis refused to [[lip-sync]] to them.<ref name="pg140">{{harvnb|Frank|Ganz|2005|p=140}}</ref> For example, in the "Here Comes Your Man" video, both Black and Deal open their mouths wide instead of mouthing their lyrics.<ref name=popbu>{{cite web|url=http://www.popbunker.net/2009/11/weekly-song-addiction-pixies-man/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020143/http://www.popbunker.net/2009/11/weekly-song-addiction-pixies-man/|archive-date=July 24, 2011|title=Weekly Song Addiction: The Pixies—"Here Comes Your Man"|author=Rudder, Jack|work=Pop Bunker|date=November 9, 2009|access-date=January 24, 2011}}</ref> According to the record label, this became one of the reasons that the Pixies never achieved major coverage on [[MTV]].<ref name="pg140" /> With ''Bossanova''{{'}}s release, 4AD hoped to get the Pixies chosen to perform their single "Velouria" on the BBC's ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref name=mendel2>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|2005|p=94}}</ref> To this end, the band was pressured into producing a video for the song, and made one cheaply with the band members filmed running down a quarry, shown in slow motion.<ref name="pg140" /><ref name=barding>{{cite web|url=http://www.playlouder.com/feature/+pixies4/ |title=The Pixies And Me |access-date=January 23, 2011 |author=Barding, Andy |work=Playlouder.com |date=June 7, 2004 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061124134746/http://www.playlouder.com/feature/%2Bpixies4/ |archive-date=November 24, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The group was ultimately not given a spot on the show.<ref name=barding/><ref name=mendel3>{{harvnb|Mendelssohn|2005|p=95}}</ref>

The 90-minute documentary ''loudQUIETloud: a film about the Pixies'' was directed by [[Steven Cantor]] and [[Matthew Galkin]] and released in 2006. The film documents their 2004 reunion and tour, and covers the years after the break-up.<ref name=loudq>{{cite web | url=http://loudquietloud.com/|year=2006|title=loudQUIETloud: a film about the Pixies|work=loudQuietloud.com|access-date= November 21, 2010}}</ref> In addition to ''Pixies'' and ''LoudQUIETloud'', four other Pixies' DVDs were released between 2004 and 2006, all featuring concert performances: ''Live at the Town and Country Club 1988'',<ref name=allmu16>{{cite web|url= https://www.allmusic.com/album/live-at-the-town-and-country-club-1988-r819259|title=Live at the Town and Country Club 1988|work=Allmusic|access-date=February 6, 2011}}</ref> ''The Pixies—Sell Out'',<ref name=rhino/> ''The Pixies Acoustic: Live in Newport'',<ref>{{harvnb|Cornelius|2006}}</ref> and ''The Pixies Club Date: Live at the Paradise in Boston''.<ref>{{harvnb|Wallis|2006}}</ref>
