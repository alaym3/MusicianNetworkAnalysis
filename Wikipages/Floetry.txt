===Beginnings: 1994–2002===
Marsha Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart first met on the basketball courts in London, England. There they quickly transitioned from rivals to friends, bonding over their love for music and poetry.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/74159/floetic-duo-draws-on-philly-scene|title='Floetic' Duo Draws On Philly Scene|website=Billboard|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> The first collaboration came when Ambrosius contacted Stewart about adding poetry to the chorus of a song she was working on called 'Fantasize'. Stewart invited Ambrosius onstage to perform the song at her show a few months later. Their connection was felt all throughout the venue, with many people crying during the show.<ref name=":0" /> In 1997, the two began writing music together and constantly performing in the music venues of London.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/floetry-mn0000188206/biography|title=Floetry {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2019-03-13}}</ref> After three years the duo moved to the United States of America, first living in Atlanta but later moving to Philadelphia where much success was found.<ref name=":1" /> Since moving to the United States in 2000, they have written for [[Jill Scott]], [[Larry "Jazz" Anthony|Jazz]] of [[Dru Hill]], [[Glenn Lewis]] (Marsha only), [[Bilal (musician)|Bilal]], and [[Michael Jackson]], for whom Marsha penned the hit 2002 single "[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]".
