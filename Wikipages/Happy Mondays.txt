'''Happy Mondays''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[City of Salford|Salford]] in 1980. The [[musical group|band]]'s original line-up was [[Shaun Ryder]] (vocals), his brother [[Paul Ryder]] ([[bass guitar|bass]]), Gary Whelan (drums), Paul Davis (keyboard), and Mark Day (guitar). [[Bez (dancer)|Mark "Bez" Berry]] later joined the band onstage as a dancer/percussionist. [[Rowetta]] joined the band as a vocalist in 1990.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

The group's work bridged the Manchester [[independent rock]] music of the 1980s and the emerging UK [[rave]] scene, drawing influence from [[funk]], [[house music|house]], and [[psychedelic music|psychedelia]] to pioneer the [[Madchester]] sound.<ref name="all">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=Biography|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/happy-mondays-mn0000553483/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=19 November 2016}}</ref> They experienced their commercial peak with the releases ''[[Bummed]]'' (1988), ''[[Madchester Rave On]]'' (1989), and ''[[Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches]]'' (1990), with the last going platinum in the UK.<ref name="all"/> They disbanded in 1993, and have reformed several times in subsequent decades.

==History==

===First incarnation===
The band were signed to [[Factory Records]] after passing a demo tape to Phil Saxe, a trader at [[Manchester Arndale]] who was on friendly terms with [[Mike Pickering]], a DJ at the [[The Haçienda|Haçienda]] nightclub.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Robb|first1=John|title=The North Will Rise Again: Manchester Music City 1976-1996|date=2009|publisher=Aurum Press|location=London|page=261}}</ref> Saxe became the band's manager.

Their first release was the "Forty Five EP", often called the "Delightful EP" after its first track. It was released on [[Factory Records]] in September 1985.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Their first album, ''[[Squirrel and G-Man Twenty Four Hour Party People Plastic Face Carnt Smile (White Out)]]'', was released in 1987 and was produced by [[John Cale]]. This was followed by two further albums: ''[[Bummed]]'', in 1988, produced by [[Martin Hannett]], and ''[[Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches]]'', in 1990, produced by [[Paul Oakenfold]] and [[Steve Osborne]]. The latter, recorded at [[Capitol Studios]] in Los Angeles, went platinum in the UK, selling more than 350,000 copies. Singles "[[Step On]]" and "[[Kinky Afro]]" from this album both reached number 5 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 2"/>

By the late 1980s, the Happy Mondays were an important part of the Manchester music scene and personified [[rave]] culture. Numerous world tours meant the band had international success as well as massive success in their home country. The line-up of the band during this first and most important ten-year phase never changed, and the six original members Shaun Ryder, Paul Ryder, Gary Whelan, Paul Davis, Mark Day, and Mark "Bez" Berry remained a tight unit until the first incarnation came to an end in 1994.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years">{{cite book

Musically, the band fused indie pop guitars with a rhythmic style that owed much to [[house music]], [[Krautrock]], [[funk]], and [[northern soul]].<ref>David Szatmary Rockin' In Time A Social History of Rock and Roll {{ISBN|978-0-205-93624-3}}</ref> Much of their music was remixed by popular [[DJ]]s, emphasizing the dance influences even further. In terms of style and dress, they crossed [[hippy]] fashion and ideals with 1970s glamour. Sartorially and musically, the band helped to encourage the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]] revival associated with [[acid house]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} One of their most popular songs is "Lazyitis (One Armed Boxer)", featuring a surreal duet between Ryder and [[Karl Denver]]. In February 1991, Happy Mondays played in [[Rock in Rio|Rock in Rio 2]] at the [[Maracanã Stadium]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]],<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 3">{{cite book | first= John

The Mondays also influenced many bands around the Northwest and beyond, including [[the Stone Roses]], [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], and [[The Charlatans (English band)|the Charlatans]]. A multi-city US tour followed, with the group returning home early in May 1991.<ref name="NME Rock 'N' Roll Years 4">{{cite book

''[[Yes Please!]]'' followed in 1992, produced by [[Chris Frantz]] and [[Tina Weymouth]], recorded at [[Eddy Grant]]'s studio in [[Barbados]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Mad Mondays: 23 of the craziest tales about Shaun Ryder, Bez and Co|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/music/happy-mondays-23-mad-tales-819105|work=Mirror Lifestyle|publisher=Mirror Online|access-date=6 May 2012|author=Steve Anglesey|format=News article|date=4 May 2012}}</ref> The album was a commercial failure that bankrupted Factory Records.<ref>{{cite web|title=25 Years On: Happy Mondays' Yes Please!

===Second incarnation===
Happy Mondays disbanded in 1993, and Shaun Ryder and Bez formed [[Black Grape]] with ex-[[Paris Angels]] guitarist "Wags" (who would later go on to serve in the 1999–2000 reincarnation of the Mondays) and ex-[[Ruthless Rap Assassins]] star Kermit.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Seven years passed, and in 1999 Happy Mondays re-formed,<ref>{{cite news|title=It's great when you're straight|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/feb/25/popandrock.features1|work=The Observer|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|access-date=6 May 2012|author=Miranda Sawyer|format=News article|date=25 February 2007}}</ref> with founding members Shaun Ryder, Paul Ryder, Gary Whelan and Bez minus Paul Davis and Mark Day. In the place of Day and Davis were Wags and a number of other session musicians including Ben Leach who had once been a member of [[The Farm (British band)|The Farm]], percussionist Lea Mullen, and rapper "Nuts". Also joining the new line-up was soul diva Rowetta Satchell (who sang back-up on Pills, Thrills, and Bellyaches, as well as Yes Please!, and who would go on to have solo success). The band toured extensively in the UK and internationally, selling out the 20,000 capacity [[Manchester Arena]] and two nights at [[Brixton Academy]], and released a new single, a cover version of the [[Thin Lizzy]] hit "The Boys Are Back in Town". The single reached number 24 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book| first= David| last= Roberts| year= 2006| title= British Hit Singles & Albums| edition= 19th| publisher= Guinness World Records Limited| location= London| isbn= 1-904994-10-5| pages= 242–243}}</ref> They provided support for [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] on their "Standing on the Shoulder of Giants" arena tour, played at the [[Fuji Rock Festival]] in [[Japan]], numerous European festivals including T in the Park and also toured Australia the same year. Although critically acclaimed and playing to sell-out crowds, the band once more ceased their activity in 2001 following the departure of bass player and founding member Paul Ryder.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Paul Ryder on Life with the Happy Mondays|url=http://www.live4ever.uk.com/2011/05/interview-paul-ryder-on-life-with-the-happy-mondays/|work=Live4ever|publisher=Live4ever Ezine|access-date=6 May 2012|format=Interview|date=11 May 2011}}</ref>

A fictionalised depiction of the band is featured in the 2002 film ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'', with Danny Cunningham as Shaun Ryder and [[Paul Popplewell]] as Paul Ryder. Paul Ryder himself had a cameo role in the film as a [[gangster]] and [[Rowetta]] (who sang for the band on ''[[Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches]]'' and ''[[Yes Please!]]'') appeared in the film as herself.<ref>{{cite web|title=24 Hour Party People|url=http://thevoid99.blogspot.com/2012/03/24-hour-party-people.html|work=Surrender to the Void|publisher=thevoid99 2012|access-date=6 May 2012|date=28 March 2012}}</ref>

===Third incarnation===
2004 saw another re-formation, comprising original members Bez, Whelan and Shaun Ryder along with another group of musicians. Shaun Ryder recruited [[Kav Sandhu]] to join on guitar & bring in a new group of musicians. Kav brought on-board bassist Mikey Shine, keyboard player Dave Parkinson & guitarist Jonn Dunn. Dave Parkinson was later replaced by Dan Broad. Backing singers on the first tour were [[Angie Brown]] and [[Ron Carroll]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kitty Empire |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/10/popandrock |title=Pop: Happy Mondays, Astoria, London WC2 &#124; Music &#124; The Observer |work=The Guardian|date=2007-06-10 |access-date=2012-12-25}}</ref> from 2004 to 2006 the band were managed by Danny Newman, MD at London Club [[Turnmills]] brother of London Club DJ Tall Paul. Rowetta's backing vocal role was now being performed by Julie E. Gordon who toured with the band until 2010. Paul Ryder was not present, having sworn to never perform with his brother again following the 2000 break-up,<ref>{{cite web|title=Brother in Arms&nbsp;... |url=http://www.salfordstar.com/article.asp?id=117|work=Salford Star|access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> and formed his own band Big Arm. That year, the Mondays released a live DVD of a show in Barcelona. The Mondays played a variety of festival dates in 2005 (including [[Global Gathering]]), capping it off with a concert at the Manchester Arena.

In June 2006, Happy Mondays performed in [[Liverpool]], and on 30 July 2006 they were special guests at the Fuji Rock Festival.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fuji Rock Festival No.&nbsp;12: What happened?|url=http://www.smash-uk.com/frf12/history_06.html|work=Fuji Rock|publisher=Smash Corporation Ltd|access-date=6 May 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519024210/http://www.smash-uk.com/frf12/history_06.html|archive-date=19 May 2012}}</ref> In August 2006, the band announced that they had completed their first album in fourteen years, with producers Sunny Levine and [[Howie B]], and had signed to [[Sanctuary Records]]. A single "Playground Superstar", from the soundtrack for the football film ''[[Goal! (film)|Goal!]]'', was released a few months prior to completion of the new album, ''[[Uncle Dysfunktional]]'' released in mid 2007.<ref>{{cite news|title=Happy Mondays: Biography|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/happy-mondays|work=The Guardian home|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|access-date=6 May 2012|date=13 August 2010}}</ref> on Noel Gallaghers label [[Big Brother Records]].

Happy Mondays performed before another re-formed act, [[Rage Against the Machine]], at the 2007 [[Coachella Music Festival]] in [[Indio, California]]. They were introduced by Tony Wilson. Bez missed the show because he could not get into the US due to "passport issues".<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Mondays' Bez Denied Visa For Coachella|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/music/Happy-Mondays-Bez-Denied-Visa-For-Coachella-3987.html|work=Pop Blend|publisher=Cinema Blend LLC|access-date=6 May 2012|author=J.P.Gorman|format=News article|date=26 April 2007}}</ref> The band then toured throughout the summer of 2007 including a trip to the [http://www.musikknyheter.no/news/3135 Numusic Festival] in Norway. They played [[Splendour in the Grass]] in [[Australia]] in July 2009, and the UK [[V Festival]] in August 2009.

Happy Mondays toured the US and Canada with [[The Psychedelic Furs]] in late 2009 with Paul Ryder's son and Shaun Ryder's nephew Jake Ryder filling in for Gaz Whelan on drums.<ref>{{cite web|title=Psychedelic Furs sharp, Happy Mondays stiff at Mouse House|url=http://soundcheck.ocregister.com/2009/09/20/psychedelic-furs-sharp-happy-mondays-stiff-at-mouse-house/12085/|work=The Sound Check|publisher=2012 Orange County Register Communications|access-date=6 May 2012|author=George.A.Paul|date=20 September 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110424025332/http://soundcheck.ocregister.com/2009/09/20/psychedelic-furs-sharp-happy-mondays-stiff-at-mouse-house/12085/|archive-date=24 April 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Happy Mondays appeared at the Wizard Festival in North-East Scotland in August 2010.<ref>{{cite news|title=Happy Mondays to cast spell at Wizard Festival|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/north_east/8598606.stm|work=BBC Uk|publisher=BBC|access-date=6 May 2012|date=1 April 2010}}</ref>

This version of the band continued until 2010. Members Mikey Shine, Jonn Dunn & Dan Broad continued to back Shaun Ryder for his solo tour until 2011, surrounding the release of his autobiography.

===Fourth incarnation===
On 29 January 2012, Shaun Ryder announced on radio station Xfm that the band would return with the original and definitive lineup of himself, his brother [[Paul Ryder]] on bass, Gary Whelan on drums, Rowetta as female vocalist, Mark Day on guitar, Paul Davis on keyboards and dancer Mark Berry. They appeared on ITV's ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]'', and were interviewed by [[Philip Schofield]]. Shaun Ryder pronounced that amends had been made, friendships reinstated and that it was just like the old days, but without the madness. They did a 13-date UK tour in May 2012, most of which were sold out, and an extra date was added at London's Brixton Academy due to the demand for tickets.<ref>{{cite web|title=Interview: Shaun Ryder from Happy Mondays|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/entertainment-in-newcastle/music/2012/02/01/interview-shaun-ryder-from-happy-mondays-72703-30237783/|work=Evening Chronicle|publisher=Media Limited.|access-date=6 May 2012|author=Gordon Barr|date=1 February 2012}}</ref> The tour included other shows at the Manchester Arena, plus other dates in [[Bournemouth]], [[Glasgow]], [[Dublin]], [[Leeds]], [[Sheffield]] and [[Nottingham]]. To coincide with the band's reformation tour a [[best of]] album, ''Double Double Good'' was released in July 2012, as well as a live recording of the band's May 2012 gig in [[Brixton]]. The band went on to play gigs in [[Chile]] and [[Argentina]] in May 2012 and then a number of European festivals in the summer of 2012, including Ireland's Sea Sessions, Scotland's T in the Park, the band were headliners at Camp Bestival in [[Dorset]] in July 2012 and they performed at the V Festivals in August 2012. They then travelled to [[Majorca]] and [[Ibiza]] to play the Ibiza and Majorca Rocks events.

The band announced in September 2012 that they were writing their first album with the original lineup in more than 20 years. {{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

The band played two nights at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]], London and in [[Manchester]] in December 2012. They travelled to [[Dubai]] in April 2013 to perform and in May 2013 played gigs at [[Bristol]]'s Vegfest and one in [[Brighton]].

The band signed to [[Creation Management]] in 2015. They have announced an international tour to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the ''Pills 'n' Thrills and Bellyaches''.

In September 2015, a special programme on [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]] called ''Singing in the Rainforest'' followed the band as they travelled to [[Panama]] to record a new song with an isolated tribe called the Embera.<ref name="NME tour news">{{cite news|title=Happy Mondays Confirm They'll Play 25th Anniversary 'Pills 'n' Thrills&nbsp;...'

Although billed as the first original line-up recording since 1992, Paul Davis was not present, and no mention of him was made. Gaz Whelan confirmed via the Happy Mondays Twitter account (in answer to a question from a Twitter user named ormi_shinobi) that Davis had left the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Happy_Mondays/status/646368389271789568|title=Happy Mondays on Twitter|website=Twitter.com}}</ref>
