'''You Love Her Coz She's Dead''' is an English [[electronic music]] project formed in [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 2007.

== History ==
The project signed to French record label [[Kitsuné]] as a duo in 2008. Their debut single, "Wizards", appeared on the label's ''Gildas & Masaya – Paris'' compilation in May 2008. "Superheroes" was included on ''Kitsuné Maison Compilation 6'' in October 2008. Their first [[Extended play|EP]], ''Inner City Angst'', was released in November 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohhcrapp.net/2008/09/interview-you-love-her-coz-shes-dead.html|work=Ohh!

You Love Her Coz She's Dead appeared, performing the single "Superheroes", on the third series of British teen drama series ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' in "[[JJ (Skins episode)|JJ]]" during a drug-fueled fight scene in a nightclub.<ref name="May">May, Jake (2010) "[http://www.thisisbath.co.uk/entertainmentnews/Musical-youth-Hadouken-help-launch-new-initiative/article-2390387-detail/article.html Musical youth: Hadouken! help launch new initiative]", ''[[Bath Chronicle]]'', 8 July 2010, retrieved 2010-07-11</ref> The artist then known as Sucker Twin joined with YLHCSD in 2008 as an alumni collaborating regularly and touring with them documenting their shows. She joined officially in 2009 but left the same year. By 2012 Elle had left the duo, and new singer Guilia joined up. That year Sucker Twin (now known Audrey Maud Haïgan in US band Chaembers) also re-joined and they were -briefly- a trio once again. The latter and the former no longer collaborate according to social media.

The band's [[Eponym|self-titled]] debut album was released in August 2011 on independent label, Glasstone Records, with two singles from the album released prior to the studio compilation.

In April 2012, the band released a statement through [[Facebook]] that Elle had left the duo. Jay has been collaborating with [[Mia Mort]] since June 2014.<ref name="About">Official Facebook Biography "[https://m.facebook.com/youlovehercozshesdead/about About  – 16/06/2014]" Retrieved 2014-06-16</ref>

In 2021 Jay announced on their official twitter that he would be working on new material for the project. His new single "Culture Test" released on August 18th 2021.

== Awards and nominations ==
They won the award for Best Electronica Act at the 2008 Indy Awards.<ref name="McKeown">McKeown, Rory (2008) "[http://www.bridgwatermercury.co.uk/leisure/whats_on/3560663.Rising_indie_stars_set_for_Bridgwater_show/ Rising indie stars set for Bridgwater show]", ''[[Bridgwater Mercury]]'', 31 July 2008, retrieved 2010-07-11</ref>
