===Early years: 1975–1982===
At age 21, Jones began singing traditional jazz and original compositions in bars and coffee houses in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], California.  There she met Alfred Johnson, a piano player and songwriter, with whom she wrote "Weasel and the White Boys Cool", and "Company", which would later appear on Jones's debut album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rickieleejones.com/rickieleejones.html |title=Rickie Lee Jones |access-date=July 7, 2015 }}</ref> In 1977, Jones met [[Tom Waits]] at [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]].<ref name="independent1">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-tom-and-rickie-show-why-the-relationship-of-rocks-superstar-couple-was-doomed-1637534.html |title=The Tom and Rickie show: Why the relationship of rock's superstar couple was doomed |work=The Independent |date=March 8, 2009 |access-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref>  They dated for about a year, then remained a public couple for most of her career.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

''[[Rickie Lee Jones (album)|Rickie Lee Jones]]'' was released in March 1979 and became a hit, buoyed by the success of the jazz-flavored single "[[Chuck E.'s in Love]]", which hit {{Abbr|No.|Number}}&nbsp;4 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and featured an accompanying [[music video]]. The song was occasioned by her friend, Chuck E. Weiss, telephoning her and Tom Waits, all three of them close friends at the time, in the Fall of 1977 to tell them that he had fallen in love.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/31/https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/30/arts/chuck-e-weiss-dead.html|first1=Penelope|last1=Green|title=Chuck E.

Her appearance – as an unknown (one month after her debut record had been released) – on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on April 7, 1979, sparked an overnight sensation. She performed "[[Chuck E.'s in Love]]" and "Coolsville".<ref>{{cite web|author=Saturday Night Live|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0694926/|title=''Richard Benjamin/Rickie Lee Jones''|work =[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |date=April 7, 1979|access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Jones was covered by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine on her very first professional show, in Boston, and they dubbed her "The Duchess of Coolsville". Touring after the album's release, she played [[Carnegie Hall]] on July 22, 1979. Members of her group included native New York guitarist [[Buzz Feiten]], who was featured on the album and would appear in her recorded works for over a decade.

Following her first ever performances in the spring/summer of 1979, Jones appeared on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine. Photographed by [[Annie Leibovitz]], the cover image showed Jones posing in a crouched stance, wearing a black bra and a white beret.<ref>Rolling Stone Magazine, issue 297, August 9, 1979. Cover. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Timothy White. Pages 40–45.</ref> The announcement of [[Lowell George]]'s death appeared in the same issue, the largest selling issue in the magazine's history up to that time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}  Her record was the first music 'video' used to launch an artist. Warner Brothers financed not only the film of the charismatic beginner but paid to install monitors in record stores to promote her image and music. Eighteen months later MTV hit the airwaves. Jones's success proved video was the most effective marketing tool in decades.

She secured four nominations at the [[22nd Annual Grammy Awards]]: [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for "Chuck E.'s in Love"; [[Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance]] for "The Last Chance Texaco"; and [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist]], which she won. The album went platinum within a year.

In 1980, [[Francis Ford Coppola]] asked Jones to collaborate with Waits on his upcoming film ''[[One from the Heart]]'', but she balked, citing their recent breakup in late 1979<ref name="independent1" />). Coppola argued that the duet would be perfect for the film, since the two main characters in the film are separated, and he asked her to reconsider. Waits ultimately sang with country pop star [[Crystal Gayle]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/rickie-lee-jones/news/jones-regrets-snubbing-coppola-offer_1222173|title=Jones Regrets Snubbing Coppola Offer|publisher=contactmusic.com|date= May 30, 2011|access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref>

''Pirates'', her second LP, received high marks from critics, achieving gold certification. ''Rolling Stone'' remained a fervent supporter of Jones, with a second cover feature in 1981;<ref>Rolling Stone Magazine, issue 349, August 6. 1981. Cover. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Timothy White. Pages 36–39, 41.</ref> the magazine also included a glowing five-star review of ''Pirates'', which became a commercially successful follow-up, reaching No.&nbsp;5 on the Billboard&nbsp;200. The single "A Lucky Guy" became the only Billboard Hot 100 hit from the album, peaking at No.&nbsp;64, but "Pirates (So Long Lonely Avenue)" and "Woody and Dutch on the Slow Train to Peking" became minor Top 40 hits on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart. In America, "Woody and Dutch..." soundalikes appeared in advertisements for [[McDonald's]], [[Dr. Pepper]], and others.

Jones left New York for San Francisco where she befriended Robin Williams. In Los Angeles, she recorded the EP ''Girl at Her Volcano'', producing the record herself and drawing the cover art. It was released as a 10" record in 1983, featuring a mix of live and studio cover versions of [[jazz standards|jazz]] and [[pop standards]], as well as one Jones original, "Hey, Bub", which was originally written for ''Pirates''. Jones then relocated to Paris.

=== Period of transition: 1983–89 ===
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2021}}

In 1983, Jones lived in Paris for four months, writing new material for her third full-length solo album, ''[[The Magazine (album)|The Magazine]]'', released in September 1984. ''The Magazine'' was produced by Jones and [[James Newton Howard]] and included a three-song suite, subtitled "Rorschachs", which featured multi-tracked vocals and minimalist synth patterns.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} One song, "The Real End" made it into the Billboard Hot 100 in 1984, peaking at No. 82.

A collaboration with [[Rob Wasserman]] [[Autumn Leaves (1945 song)|"Autumn Leaves"]] in 1985 for his album ''Duets'' earned a [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nod for Best Jazz Vocal by a Female. Jones took a four-year break from her recording schedule, largely attributed to the deaths of her mentor Bob Regher as well as her father, Richard Loris Jones, that same year.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.rickieleejones.com/|title=Biography|first= Hilton |last=Als|publisher=Rickieleejones.com|access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref>

After a successful tour of Norway and Sweden, and then opening for Ray Charles in Israel with Michal Lang (Woodstock) managing her, she returned to the USA, signed to Geffen Records by Gary Gersh who teamed her with [[Steely Dan]]'s [[Walter Becker]] for her long awaited fourth and a half record.  In September 1988 the two of them began work on ''[[Flying Cowboys]]'', which was probably the best pop album of her career. The album was released in September 1989,  and produced two hits: Satellites, which hit #1 on the new Adult radio format; and "[[The Horses]]", co-written with Becker, was covered by Kenny Loggins, and also featured in the movie ''[[Jerry Maguire]]''. "The Horses" also became an Australian No.&nbsp;1 hit single for [[Daryl Braithwaite]] when he covered it in 1991.  ''Flying Cowboys'' made the US Top 40, reaching No.&nbsp;39 on the Billboard 200, with the college radio hit "Satellites" making it to No.&nbsp;23 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.

Jones ended the decade on a high note with her duet with [[Dr. John]], a cover of "[[Makin' Whoopee]]", winning her second [[Grammy Award]], this time in the category of Best Jazz Vocal Collaboration.

=== Experimentation and change: 1990–2001 ===

Following a tour with [[Lyle Lovett]], Jones enlisted [[David Was]] to helm her first album of jazz covers - a direction she had forged for rock artists but had never recorded. Many singers had followed her lead and for those who did not realize her devotion to jazz in her performances on stage they would have thought her just another rock pop singer doing jazz. Her producer chose an innovative approach and she agreed,  thus the Argentinian flavored ''[[Pop Pop]]'', set the pace for what would become a habit with Miss Jones - innovation, defiance,  mixing styles of jazz and pop and not staying in one genre for a whole recording. [[Tin Pan Alley]] to [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s "[[Up from the Skies]]". The album, released in September 1991, was a hit on the Billboard Contemporary Jazz Albums, peaking at No.&nbsp;8, but became her least commercially successful record yet, reaching No.&nbsp;121 on the Billboard 200.

Soon after, [[The Orb]] issued "[[Little Fluffy Clouds]]", featuring a [[sampling (music)|sampled]] Jones interview. However, Jones' record company objected to the unauthorized use of her voice and pursued the issue in the court system. In 1992 she toured extensively with Rob Wasserman, with whom she had collaborated in the mid-1980s.

Her swan song for Geffen Records was ''[[Traffic From Paradise]]'',  released in September 1993. The album was slightly more successful than its predecessor, reaching No.&nbsp;111 on the Billboard 200, and was notable for its collaboration with [[Leo Kottke]], its musical diversity, and a cover of [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Rebel Rebel]]", which was originally planned to be the title track for the Oscar-winning film ''[[Boys Don't Cry (1999 film)|Boys Don't Cry]].'' Before his death David Bowie was quoted as saying that this version was his favorite cover of his work.

Throughout this period, her songs were featured in a number of films and television series, including ''[[House (TV series)|House M.D.]]'', ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirty Something]]'', ''[[Frankie and Johnny (1991 film)|Frankie and Johnny]]'', ''[[When a Man Loves a Woman (film)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]'', ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', ''[[Friends with Money]]'' and the French film ''[[Subway (film)|Subway]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0429122/|title=Rickie Lee Jones|website =[[Internet Movie Database|IMDb]] |access-date=July 7, 2015}}</ref> Jones sang a duet with [[Lyle Lovett]] on "North Dakota" for his 1992 album ''[[Joshua Judges Ruth]]'' and has also sung on albums by Leo Kottke and [[Arlo Guthrie]].

Jones' first solo shows in 1994 paved the way for her acoustic album ''[[Naked Songs - Live And Acoustic|Naked Songs]]'', released in September 1995 through a one-off deal with [[Reprise Records]]. The album, which reached No.&nbsp;121 on the Billboard 200, featured acoustic re-workings of Jones classics and album material, but no new songs.

Emphasizing her experimentation and change, Jones embraced electronic music for ''[[Ghostyhead]]'', released on Reprise Records in June 1997. The album, a collaboration with [[Rick Boston]] (both are credited with production and with twenty-one instruments in common), found Jones employing beats, loops, and electronic rhythms, and also showcased Jones' connection with the [[trip hop]] movement of the mid-to-late 1990s. Despite critical acclaim, it did not meet with commercial success, peaking at No.&nbsp;159 on the Billboard 200.

Jones' second album of cover versions, ''[[It's Like This]]'', was released on the independent record label [[Artemis Records]] in September 2000. The album included cover versions of material by artists including [[The Beatles]], [[Steely Dan]], [[Marvin Gaye]], and the [[Gershwin]] brothers. It made it onto three Billboard charts – No.148 on the Billboard 200, No.&nbsp;10 on Top Internet Albums, and No.&nbsp;42 on Top Independent Albums. The album also secured Jones another [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album|Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album]].  Her cover art design (shared with a staff artist but never credited to Jones) won numerous awards and is in the book Best Album Covers.

In November 2001, Artemis issued a release of archival material titled ''Live at Red Rocks'' with cover art by a young fan who had recently died in a swimming accident. Her parents brought her drawing of flying horses to one of Jones' shows in Oregon and Rickie used it for this live release.

After ''Ghostyhead'', Jones largely retired from public view, tending her garden and bringing up her teenage daughter Charlotte.<ref name=HiltonNYMag>{{cite magazine |last=Als |first=Hilton |date=April 10, 2000 |title=The Musical Life Rickie Lee Jones and Four Guys in a Studio |page=33 |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/04/10/the-musical-life-rickie-lee-jones-and-four-guys-in-a-studio |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181118133027/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2000/04/10/the-musical-life-rickie-lee-jones-and-four-guys-in-a-studio |archive-date=November 18, 2018 |access-date=April 15, 2016}} [http://www.rickieleejones.com/hilton.htm Alt URL]</ref>

Released on the independent label [[V2 Records|V2]] in October 2003, ''[[The Evening of My Best Day]]'' featured influences from jazz, [[Celtic folk]], blues, R&B, rock, and [[gospel music|gospel]], and spawned a successful and lengthy spurt of touring. The album peaked at No.&nbsp;189 on the Billboard 200. She invited punk bass icon [[Mike Watt]] (the Minutemen, Iggy Pop) to perform on "It Takes You There", while "Ugly Man" was a direct aim at the [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] 'regime' evoking, with an anthem-like [[Hugh Masekela]] arrangement, what she termed "the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]] horns", and calling for "revolution, everywhere that you're not looking, revolution."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://downwithtyranny.blogspot.com/2006/11/rickie-lee-jones-what-happens-after.html |first=Rickie Lee |last=Jones |website=Down With Tyranny |title=Rickie Lee Jones: What Happens After Ugly Man? |date=November 19, 2006 |access-date=April 15, 2016}}</ref>
 
Renewed interest in Jones led to the three-disc anthology ''Duchess of Coolsville: An Anthology'', released through reissue specialists [[Rhino Entertainment|Rhino]] in June 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4810017 |title=Working with the 'Duchess of Coolsville' |publisher=NPR |date=August 22, 2005 |access-date=September 9, 2017}}</ref> A lavish package designed by Lee Cantelon, the alphabetically arranged release featured album songs, live material, covers, and demos, and featured essays by Jones as well as various collaborators, as well as tributes from artists including [[Randy Newman]], [[Walter Becker]], [[Quincy Jones]], and [[Tori Amos]].

Also in 2005, Jones was invited to take part in her boyfriend and collaborator Lee Cantelon's music version of his book ''The Words'', a book of the words of Christ, set into simple chapters and themes. Cantelon's idea was to have various artists recite the text over primal rock music, but Jones elected to try something that had never been done, to improvise her own impression of the texts, melody and lyric, in stream of consciousness sessions, rather than read Jesus' words. The sessions were recorded at an artist's loft on Exposition Boulevard in Culver City. When Cantelon could no longer finish the project, Jones picked it up as her own record and hired Rob Schnaf to finish the production at [[Sunset Sound]] in 2007, and the result was ''[[The Sermon on Exposition Boulevard]]'', released on the independent [[New West Records]] in February 2007. It included "Circle in the Sand", recorded for the soundtrack to the film ''[[Friends With Money]]'' (2006), for which Jones also cut "Hillbilly Song". ''The Sermon on Exposition Boulevard'' debuted at No.&nbsp;158 on the Billboard 200 and No.&nbsp;12 on the Top Independent Albums tally. Writer Ann Powers included this on her list of [[Grammy]]-worthy CDs for 2007.

For her next project, ''[[Balm in Gilead (album)|Balm in Gilead]]'' (2009), Jones opted to finish half-written songs dating back as far as 1986 ("Wild Girl") as well as include new ones (the 2008-penned "The Gospel of Carlos, Norman and Smith", "Bonfires").  The album also included a new recording of "The Moon Is Made of Gold", a song written by her father Richard Loris Jones in 1954. [[Ben Harper]], [[Victoria Williams]], [[Jon Brion]], [[Alison Krauss]] and the late [[Vic Chesnutt]] all made contributions to the album.

In May 2010, Jones performed at the [[Sydney Opera House]] as part of the [[Vivid Live]] festival.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/music/events/17276/rickie-lee-jones |title=Rickie Lee Jones – Sydney Opera House – Music |work=Time Out Sydney |access-date=April 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612031902/http://www.au.timeout.com/sydney/music/events/17276/rickie-lee-jones |archive-date=June 12, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Shortly afterwards she left Los Angeles and moved to New Orleans.

In 2019, Jones released a single of the Paul Rodgers/Simon Kirke song, "[[Bad Company (song)|Bad Company]]", followed by her album ''Kicks'' which included "Bad Company" and cover versions of many other songs.

She played at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in June 2019.

In 2021, Jones's memoir ''[[Last Chance Texaco: Chronicles of an American Troubadour]]'' was released by Grove Press.<ref>{{cite book|id={{ASIN|0802127126|country=ca}} |title=Last Chance Texaco: Chronicles of an American}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| last= O’Hagan| first= Sean| authorlink= Sean O'Hagan (journalist) | title= Rickie Lee Jones: 'I had lived volumes long before I was famous' | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/apr/18/rickie-lee-jones-memoir-last-chance-texaco-tom-waits-interview | date= 18 April 2021| work= [[The Observer]]| accessdate= 18 April 2021 }}</ref> Simon and Schuster bought the audio book rights.

In 2001, Jones was the organizer of the web community "Furniture for the People", which is involved in gardening, social activism, bootleg exchange and left-wing politics. She has produced records (including [[Leo Kottke]]'s ''[[Peculiaroso]]''), and provided a voiceover for ''[[Pinocchio and the Emperor of the Night]]'', in which she played the Blue Fairy (known as the Good Fairy or Fairy Godmother in the film). Jones also enjoys gardening.
