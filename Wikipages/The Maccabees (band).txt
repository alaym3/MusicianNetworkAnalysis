'''The Maccabees''' were an English [[indie rock]] band, formed in 2004 in London.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Maccabees at Fiction Records|url=http://www.fictionrecords.co.uk/artists/the-maccabees/|publisher=Fiction Records|access-date=28 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hall|first=Duncan|title=The Maccabees Move Back to London|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/leisure/music/4217695.The_Maccabees__Concorde_2__Brighton__March_24/|access-date=28 May 2013|newspaper=The Argus|date=20 March 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bray|first=Elisa|title=The Maccabees – The quiet men of guitar rock|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-maccabees--the-quiet-men-of-guitar-rock-go-large-6699385.html|access-date=28 May 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=10 February 2012}}</ref> They released four albums: ''[[Colour It In]]'' in 2007, followed by ''[[Wall of Arms]]'' in 2009, ''[[Given to the Wild]]'' which was released on 9 January 2012 and their last album ''[[Marks to Prove It]]'' released on 31 July 2015.

==Name==
The band came up with the name by flicking through the Bible and picking out a random word.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7169685.stm|work=BBC Entertainment|title=Talking Shop: The Maccabees|access-date=14 January 2008 | date=7 January 2008}}</ref> Despite adopting a name with perceived [[Maccabees|religious connotations]], lead singer Orlando Weeks has more recently affirmed, in an interview on [[Steve Lamacq]]'s [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] show, that none of the band is religious.{{Disputed inline|date=June 2019}}.

==Music career==

===2007–2009: ''Colour It In''===
Their debut single, "X-Ray", was released on Promise records on 28 November 2005, and received some evening play on London radio station [[Xfm London]]. They received little significant exposure, however, until six months later, when they released their second single, "Latchmere", the subject of which is the wave machine at the Latchmere Leisure Centre in Battersea, South London,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/Maccabees/8449 |title=NME Album Reviews – The Maccabees: Colour It In |work=NME |date=27 April 2007 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> on [[Fierce Panda Records]] in April 2006. This was championed by [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] DJ [[Steve Lamacq]] and received airtime on [[MTV2]]. The video, directed by Hugh Frost and Samuel Bebbington, also proved an internet hit after it was posted on YouTube. They had their first taste of festivals by playing on the [[Carling brewery|Carling]] stage of the Leeds/Reading festival in 2006.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.leedsfestival.com/history/leeds-festival-2006 |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707122034/http://www.leedsfestival.com/history/leeds-festival-2006 |archive-date=7 July 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

The band were signed to major label [[Fiction Records]], and released their debut album ''[[Colour It In]]'' in May 2007. Because an early copy of the album appeared on the ''New York Times'' website, ''Colour It In'' became available to download exclusively from [[iTunes]] on 16 December, before its physical release on 14 May, in an effort to combat the leak. The single "[[First Love (The Maccabees song)|First Love]]" was their first to chart in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK top 40]], and was followed by "[[About Your Dress]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;33. Their album received positive reviews, and charted at No.&nbsp;24. They then toured the United States with fellow indie group [[Bloc Party]]. A full UK tour followed from October 2007, culminating in a sell-out show at the [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]] venue in London.

===2009–2010: ''Wall of Arms''===
On the run-up to the release of their second album, the band played two new songs to [[Steve Lamacq]] on his "In New Music We Trust" show on [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] in May 2008, "No Kind Words" and "Young Lions". The band also played a string of small venues in the UK to test out new songs, in March and April 2008. The Maccabees performed at [[Offset Festival]] in London as well the [[Underage Festival]] in August 2008.

On Zane Lowe's Radio 1 show in February 2009, Felix confirmed the name of the follow-up album to be ''[[Wall of Arms]]'', an announcement that coincided with the release of the free downloadable track, "No Kind Words". On 16 March, Radio 1 DJ [[Steve Lamacq]] played the band's first single from ''Wall of Arms'' entitled [[Love You Better(song)|Love You Better]], the video to which was posted exclusively on ClashMusic.com on 27 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/maccabees-video-exclusive |title=Maccabees Video Exclusive &#124; Clash Music Exclusive Video |work=Clash |date=27 March 2009 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>

''Wall of Arms'' was released on 4 May 2009. It entered the UK albums chart at No. 13 and received positive reviews with the ''[[NME]]'' giving the album 8/10.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/reviews/the-maccabees/10389 |title=NME Album Reviews – Album review: The Maccabees |work=NME |date=28 April 2009 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> At the end of the year, ''Artrocker'' made the album joint No.1 Album of 2009 along with Yeah Yeah Yeahs' ''It's Blitz!''.

In July 2009, second single "Can You Give It" was released. The Maccabees invited the Dodworth Colliery Band<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dodworthcollieryband.co.uk/Dodworth_Colliery_MW_Brass_Band/Home.html |title=Dodworth Colliery MW Brass Band |publisher=Dodworthcollieryband.co.uk |date=11 December 2011 |access-date=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305181811/http://www.dodworthcollieryband.co.uk/Dodworth_Colliery_MW_Brass_Band/Home.html |archive-date=5 March 2012  }}</ref> of Barnsley to record a rousing brass version of the single for the B-side.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/audio/2009/jul/08/maccabees-dudworth-colliery | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Download the Maccabees and the Dodworth Colliery Band | date=8 July 2009 | access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' interviewed Orlando and Felix during the recording session.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/jul/07/maccabees | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Where there's Maccabees there's brass | first=Laura | last=Barton | date=7 July 2009 | access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref> The accompanying video<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffIaVzavIxE |title=Can You Give It (Exclusive Brand New Video) |via=YouTube |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> for "Can You Give It" was filmed at the famous Coopers Hill annual cheese rolling race<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cheese-rolling.co.uk/index1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100315075042/http://www.cheese-rolling.co.uk/index1.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=15 March 2010 |title=The Official & Only Authoritative Site Of Cheese Rolling at Coopers Hill in Gloucestershire |publisher=Cheese-rolling.co.uk |date=19 January 2012 |access-date=19 March 2012 }}</ref> in Gloucestershire.

Other performances in 2009 include [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]] on Friday 28th and Saturday 29 August respectively and [[Little Noise Sessions]] on 16 November.

On 3 October 2009, the five-piece band played a gig at Brixton Academy to finish off their ''Wall of Arms'' tour. The band pulled in a huge crowd for their homecoming show at the O2, as well as a brass section for many of their songs as they performed their entire 2009 album and a host of tracks from their 2007 debut ''Colour It In''. During the set Felix White declared the Academy as 'the best venue in the world'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-maccabees/47648 |title=The Maccabees play the 'best gig' of their lives in London  |work=NME |date=4 October 2009 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> The Guardian ran a five star live review of the gig.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/oct/05/the-maccabees-review | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The Maccabees | first=Ian | last=Gittins | date=5 October 2009 | access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref>

In November 2009, The Maccabees collaborated with rapper [[Roots Manuva]] on a heady re-working of ''Wall of Arms'' album track and live favourite "No Kind Words". The track, newly titled "Empty Vessels", features new lyrics and vocals from fellow south Londoner Roots. It was debuted on Zane Lowe's evening show on Radio One on 11 November. The single release of "Empty Vessels" was made available on iTunes from 24 November 2009 on Fiction Records.<ref>[http://www.audiotube.com/audionews/2009/12/the-maccabees-to-release-roots-manuva-collaboration/ ]{{dead link|date=March 2012}}</ref>

The Maccabees were named as headlines for the Shockwaves [[NME Awards Tour]] 2010 with [[Bombay Bicycle Club]], [[The Big Pink]] and [[The Drums]] in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-maccabees/48268 |title=Maccabees, Bombay Bicycle Club, Big Pink, Drums for Shockwaves NME Awards Tour  |work=NME |date=9 November 2009 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>

===2012–2013: ''Given to the Wild''===
The Maccabees debuted new song "Child" in [[Brighton]] in August 2010, as well as playing the Main Stage at the Reading & Leeds festival 2010, debuting new song titled "Forever I've Known", displaying what seems to be a darker, deeper sound for the band.

They played new songs "Child", "Feel to Follow", "Pelican", "Ayla", "Went Away", "Forever I've Known" and "Grew Up at Midnight" at The Wedgewood Rooms, Portsmouth on 8 August 2011.

On 4 October 2011, the band announced via their blog that their third album, ''[[Given to the Wild]]'', would be released on 9 January 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://themaccabees.tumblr.com/post/11016323733/given-to-the-wild-released-9th-january |title=The Maccabees Blog – "Given to the Wild" Released 9th January |publisher=Themaccabees.tumblr.com |date=1 March 1994 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>

The first single from the album was "Pelican", it was first played on 15 November 2011 on BBC Radio 1 by Zane Lowe. It was released on 9 January 2012 to very favourable reviews, it currently holds a score of 72 on [[Metacritic]].<ref>{{cite web|author=vermas |url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/given-to-the-wild |title=Given to the Wild Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More at Metacritic |publisher=Metacritic |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>
At the 58th [[Ivor Novello Awards]], held at Grosvenor hotel in London on Thursday 16 May 2013, "Pelican" won Best Contemporary Song.

The album was at No.&nbsp;1 on the midweek chart update, at the end of the week it debuted No.&nbsp;4 on the UK Album Chart, the highest Maccabees release to date there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/chart/albums |title=Radio 1 – Chart – The Official UK Top 40 Albums Chart |publisher=BBC |date=24 February 2007 |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>

On 12 September 2012 the album was nominated for the 2012 [[Mercury Prize]]. On 24 October 2012 the album was certified gold in the UK.

In 2015 their song "Grew Up at Midnight" was featured in the film ''[[Steve Jobs (film)|Steve Jobs]]''.

===2014–2017: ''Marks to Prove It'' and Disbanding===
In 2013 The Maccabees announced in an ''NME'' article that they were hoping to release a fourth album in early 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-maccabees/72015 |title=The Maccabees outline plan to release fourth album in early 2014  |work=NME |date=14 August 2013 |access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref> However, in January 2014 in another article with ''NME'', guitarist Felix White stated, "We started the record at the beginning of 2013. We went into the studio with the idea that it was going to be finished by now. And we've finished two songs. We've got a lot of songs but every time you write something new, it raises the standard." Frontman Orlando Weeks added, "we haven't really come across the songs that set the tone or mood for this record yet, we're kind of shooting in the dark. But I like that: there isn't a specific thing I'm trying to funnel stuff into."  <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-maccabees/74928 |title=The Maccabees reveal slow progress being made on new album  |work=NME |date=16 January 2014 |access-date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

In March 2015, it was announced that The Maccabees were going to release new single "Marks To Prove It" on 11 May through Fiction Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nenot.es/1y4lHmx |title=The Maccabees' share new video for 'Marks To Prove It' |publisher=neverenoughnotes.co.uk |date=8 April 2015 |access-date=8 April 2015}}</ref> In May 2015, the band confirmed that ''Marks To Prove It'' would feature eleven tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.inveterate.co.uk/music/the-maccabees-band-announce-fourth-album-marks-to-prove-it-tracklisting/145950/ |title=The Maccabees: Band Announce Fourth Album 'Marks To Prove It' Tracklisting |publisher=Inveterate |date=18 May 2015 |access-date=18 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518202914/http://www.inveterate.co.uk/music/the-maccabees-band-announce-fourth-album-marks-to-prove-it-tracklisting/145950/ |archive-date=18 May 2015  }}</ref> The album was recorded in the band's studio in [[Elephant and Castle]] and pays tribute to the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33776415 |title=The Maccabees: Why we love Elephant and Castle |publisher=BBC News|date=4 August 2015 |access-date=19 October 2015}}</ref>

In August 2016 the band released a statement stating that "After 14 years as a band we have decided to call it a day", with farewell shows to follow in summer 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/themaccabees/status/762601871802523648|title=The Maccabees on Twitter|access-date=8 August 2016}}{{Primary source inline|date=January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/news/The-Maccabees-Announce-Breakup/17935183.html|title=The Maccabees Announce Breakup|date=8 August 2016|website=Hot Press|access-date=8 August 2016}}</ref>
