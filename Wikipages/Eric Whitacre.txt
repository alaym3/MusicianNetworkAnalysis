'''Eric Edward Whitacre''' (born January{{nbsp}}2, 1970) is an American composer, conductor, and speaker known for his choral, orchestral, and wind ensemble music. In March{{nbsp}}2016, he was appointed as [[Los Angeles Master Chorale]]'s first artist-in-residence at the [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]].

== Early life==
Whitacre was born in [[Reno, Nevada]], to Ross and Roxanne Whitacre. He studied piano intermittently as a child and joined a junior high marching band under band leader Jim Burnett. Later Whitacre played a synthesizer in a techno-pop band, dreaming of being a rock star.<ref name="Hyperion">{{Cite web|url=https://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDA67543|title=Whitacre: Cloudburst & other choral works|website=Hyperion Records}}</ref><ref name="Composers" /> Although he initially resisted joining choir while attending college, Whitacre was eventually convinced. He described his own experience with his first choral rehearsal as a turning point in his life, saying, "In my entire life I had seen in black and white, and suddenly everything was in shocking Technicolor. It was the most transformative experience I've ever had—in that single moment, hearing dissonance and harmony, and people singing...".<ref>{{Citation|last=Whitacre|first=Eric|title=A virtual choir 2,000 voices strong|url=https://www.ted.com/talks/eric_whitacre_a_virtual_choir_2_000_voices_strong|language=en|access-date=2021-03-24}}</ref> Though he was unable to read music at the time, Whitacre began his full musical training while an undergraduate at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]], eventually taking a [[bachelor's degree]] in Music Composition.<ref name="Hyperion"/>

==Career==
Whitacre studied composition with Ukrainian composer [[Virko Baley]] and choral conducting with David Weiller, completing his bachelor's degree in 1995. Whitacre credits Weiller with the inspiration that put the young composer on the musical path.<ref name="Composers" /> At 21, he wrote his setting of "Go, Lovely Rose" for his college choir and presented the composition as a gift to David Weiller. Whitacre went on to earn his [[master's degree]] in Composition at the [[Juilliard School]], where he studied with [[John Corigliano]] and [[David Diamond (composer)|David Diamond]].<ref name="Composers">''Composers On Composing For Band'', Volume 2. Ed. Mark Camphouse, GIA Publications, 2004, {{ISBN|9781579993856}} pp. 253–262</ref> At the age of 23 he completed his first piece for Wind Orchestra, "Ghost Train", which has now been recorded more than 40 times.

He lived in Nevada until he was 25.
