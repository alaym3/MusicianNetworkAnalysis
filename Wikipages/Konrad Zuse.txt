'''Konrad Zuse''' ({{IPA-de|ˈkɔnʁat ˈtsuːzə|lang}}; 22 June 1910 – 18 December 1995) was a German [[civil engineer]], [[List of pioneers in computer science|pioneering computer scientist]], inventor and businessman. His greatest achievement was the world's first programmable [[computer]]; the functional program-controlled [[Turing completeness|Turing-complete]] [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] became operational in May 1941. Thanks to this machine and its predecessors, Zuse has often been regarded as the inventor of the modern computer.<ref>[http://ed-thelen.org/comp-hist/Zuse_Z1_and_Z3.pdf Konrad Zuse’s Legacy:The Architecture of the Z1 and Z3] Raúl Rojas ''ed-thelen.org'', accessed 12 May 2021</ref><ref>[http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/~rojas/1997/Universal_Computer.pdf] ''www.inf.fu-berlin.de'' [http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;?doi=10.1.1.37.665&rep=rep1&type=pdf] ''citeseerx.ist.psu.edu'' Raúl Rojas: How to make Zuse's Z3 a universal computer, accessed 12 May 2021.</ref><ref>[http://www.rtd-net.de/Zuse.html RTD Net]: "From various sides Konrad Zuse was awarded with the title "Inventor of the computer"."</ref><ref>[http://www.german-way.com/famous-konrad-zuse.html GermanWay] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130531063542/http://german-way.com/famous-konrad-zuse.html |date=31 May 2013 }}: "(...)German inventor of the computer"</ref><ref>[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/tech/features/article_1566782.php/Z-like-Zuse-German-inventor-of-the-computer Monsters & Critics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522022610/http://www.monstersandcritics.com/tech/features/article_1566782.php/Z-like-Zuse-German-inventor-of-the-computer |date=22 May 2013 }}: "he [Zuse] built the world's first computer in Berlin"</ref><ref>[http://inventors.about.com/library/weekly/aa050298.htm About.com]: "Konrad Zuse earned the semiofficial title of 'inventor of the modern computer{{'"}}</ref>

Zuse was noted for the S2 computing machine, considered the first [[process control]] computer. In 1941, he founded one of the earliest computer businesses, producing the [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]], which became the world's first commercial computer. From 1943<ref>''Inception of a universal theory of computation with special consideration of the propositional calculus and its application to relay circuits'' (Zuse, Konrad, (1943) "Ansätze einer Theorie des allgemeinen Rechnens unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des Aussagenkalküls und dessen Anwendung auf Relaisschaltungen"), unpublished manuscript, Zuse Papers 045/018.</ref> to 1945<ref>A book on the subject: [http://www.zib.de/zuse/English_Version/Inhalt/Texte/Chrono/40er/Pdf/0233.pdf (full text of the 1945 manuscript)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210150041/http://www.zib.de/zuse/English_Version/Inhalt/Texte/Chrono/40er/Pdf/0233.pdf |date=10 February 2012 }}</ref> he designed [[Plankalkül]], the first [[high-level programming language]].<ref name="HZ2010-11-18"/> In 1969, Zuse suggested the concept of a [[digital physics|computation-based universe]] in his book ''Rechnender Raum'' (''[[Calculating Space]]'').

Much of his early work was financed by his family and commerce, but after 1939 he was given resources by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] government.<ref name="books.google.com">[https://books.google.com/books?id=gayW7Z-B_e8C&pg=PA82&dq=zuse,+nazi&lr=&cd=24#v=onepage&q=zuse%2C%20nazi&f=false "Weapons Grade: How Modern Warfare Gave Birth To Our High-Tech World"], David Hambling.

Retrieved 14 March 2010.</ref> Due to [[World War II]], Zuse's work went largely unnoticed in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. Possibly his first documented influence on a US company was [[IBM]]'s option on his patents in 1946.

==Early life and education==
Konrad Zuse was born in [[Berlin]] on 22 June 1910.<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news|title=Konrad Zuse: First on the digital track|author=Schofield, Jack|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 December 1995|page= 13}}</ref> In 1912, his family moved to [[East Prussia]]n [[Braunsberg]] (now Braniewo in [[Poland]]), where his father was a postal clerk. Zuse attended the [[Collegium Hosianum]] in Braunsberg, and in 1923, the family moved to [[Hoyerswerda]], where he passed his [[Abitur]] in 1928, qualifying him to enter university.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

He enrolled in the ''[[Technische Hochschule]] Berlin'' (now [[Technical University of Berlin]]) and explored both engineering and architecture, but found them boring. Zuse then pursued [[civil engineering]], graduating in 1935.<ref name="Guardian"/>

==Career== 
After graduation, Zuse worked for the [[Ford Motor Company]], using his artistic skills in the design of advertisements.<ref name="HZ2010-11-18">Talk given by [[Horst Zuse]] to the [[Computer Conservation Society]] at the [[Science Museum (London)]] on 18 November 2010</ref> He started work as a design engineer at the [[Henschel]] aircraft factory in [[Schönefeld|Schönefeld near Berlin]]. This required the performance of many routine calculations by hand, which he found mind-numbing, leading him to dream of doing them by machine.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

Beginning in 1935, he experimented in the construction of computers in his parents' flat on Wrangelstraße 38, moving with them into their new flat on Methfesselstraße 10, the street leading up the [[Kreuzberg (Tempelhofer Berge)|Kreuzberg]], Berlin.<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 418">[[Hasso Spode]], "Der Computer – eine Erfindung aus Kreuzberg, Methfesselstraße 10/Oranienstraße 6", in: ''Geschichtslandschaft Berlin: Orte und Ereignisse'': 5 vols., Helmut Engel, Stefi Jersch-Wenzel, Wilhelm Treue (eds.), vol.&nbsp;5: 'Kreuzberg', Berlin: Nicolai, 1994, pp.&nbsp;418–429, here p.&nbsp;418. {{ISBN|3-87584-474-2}}.</ref> Working in his parents' apartment in 1936, he produced his first attempt, the [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]], a [[floating point]] binary mechanical calculator with limited programmability, reading instructions from a perforated 35&nbsp;mm film.<ref name="HZ2010-11-18"/> 

[[File:Zuse Z1-2.jpg|thumb|right|Zuse Z1 replica in the [[German Museum of Technology]] in Berlin]]
In 1937, Zuse submitted two patents that anticipated a [[von Neumann architecture]]. In 1938, he finished the Z1 which contained some 30,000 metal parts and never worked well due to insufficient mechanical precision. On 30 January 1944, the Z1 and its original [[blueprint]]s were destroyed with his parents' flat and many neighbouring buildings by a [[Battle of Berlin (air)|British air raid]] in [[World War II]].<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 426">Hasso Spode, "Der Computer – eine Erfindung aus Kreuzberg, Methfesselstraße 10/Oranienstraße 6", in: ''Geschichtslandschaft Berlin: Orte und Ereignisse'': 5 vols., Helmut Engel, Stefi Jersch-Wenzel, Wilhelm Treue (eds.), vol.&nbsp;5: 'Kreuzberg', Berlin: Nicolai, 1994, pp.&nbsp;418–429, p.&nbsp;426. {{ISBN|3-87584-474-2}}.</ref>

Zuse completed his work entirely independently of other leading computer scientists and mathematicians of his day. Between 1936 and 1945, he was in near-total intellectual isolation.<ref>[http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Zuse.html "Konrad Zuse"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829164932/http://www.gap-system.org/~history/Biographies/Zuse.html |date=29 August 2011 }}, Gap System.

===1939–1945===
[[File:2007-01-20 Gedenktafel Zuse Z3.jpg|thumb|right|Plaque commemorating Zuse's work, attached to the ruin of Methfesselstraße 7, Berlin]] 
In 1939, Zuse was called to military service, where he was given the resources to ultimately build the [[Z2 (computer)|Z2]].<ref name="books.google.com"/> In September 1940 Zuse presented the Z2, covering several rooms in the parental flat, to experts of the [[Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt#History|Deutsche Versuchsanstalt für Luftfahrt]] (DVL; i.e. German Research Institute for Aviation).<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 424">Hasso Spode, "Der Computer – eine Erfindung aus Kreuzberg, Methfesselstraße 10/Oranienstraße 6", in: ''Geschichtslandschaft Berlin: Orte und Ereignisse'': 5 vols., Helmut Engel, Stefi Jersch-Wenzel, Wilhelm Treue (eds.), vol.&nbsp;5: 'Kreuzberg', Berlin: Nicolai, 1994, pp.&nbsp;418–429, p.&nbsp;424. {{ISBN|3-87584-474-2}}.</ref> The Z2 was a revised version of the Z1 using telephone [[relay]]s.

In 1940, the German government began funding him and his company through the ''Aerodynamische Versuchsanstalt'' (AVA, Aerodynamic Research Institute, forerunner of the [[German Aerospace Center|DLR]]),<ref>[http://www5.in.tum.de/~huckle/mathwar.html "Mathematicians during the Third Reich and World War II"], Technische Universität München. Retrieved 14 March 2010.</ref> which used his work for the production of [[glide bomb]]s. Zuse built the S1 and S2 computing machines, which were special purpose devices which computed aerodynamic corrections to the wings of radio-controlled flying bombs. The S2 featured an integrated [[analog-to-digital converter]] under program control, making it the first process-controlled computer.<ref name=MCML />

In 1941 Zuse started a company, ''Zuse Apparatebau'' (Zuse Apparatus Construction), to manufacture his machines,<ref>{{Cite book | last = Lippe | first = Wolfram-M. | title = Die Geschichte der Rechenautomaten | trans-title = The History of Computing Machines | chapter = Kapitel 14: Die ersten programmierbaren Rechner | trans-chapter = Chapter 14: The First Programmable Computer | url = http://cs.uni-muenster.de/Professoren/Lippe/lehre/skripte/geschichte/ | chapter-url = http://cs.uni-muenster.de/Professoren/Lippe/lehre/skripte/geschichte/pdf/Kap14.pdf | access-date = 21 June 2010 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080503054847/http://cs.uni-muenster.de/Professoren/Lippe/lehre/skripte/geschichte/ | archive-date = 3 May 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref> renting a workshop on the opposite side in Methfesselstraße 7 and stretching through the block to Belle-Alliance Straße 29 (renamed and renumbered as [[Mehringdamm]] 84 in 1947).<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 418"/><ref name="Spode Computer 1994 425">Hasso Spode, "Der Computer – eine Erfindung aus Kreuzberg, Methfesselstraße 10/Oranienstraße 6", in: ''Geschichtslandschaft Berlin: Orte und Ereignisse'': 5 vols., Helmut Engel, Stefi Jersch-Wenzel, Wilhelm Treue (eds.), vol.&nbsp;5: 'Kreuzberg', Berlin: Nicolai, 1994, pp.&nbsp;418–429, p.&nbsp;425. {{ISBN|3-87584-474-2}}.</ref>

In 1941, he improved on the basic Z2 machine, and built the [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]]. On 12 May 1941 Zuse presented the Z3, built in his workshop, to the public.<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 425"/><ref name="Chod 2003 52">Kathrin Chod, Herbert Schwenk and Hainer Weißpflug, ''Berliner Bezirkslexikon: Friedrichshain-Kreuzberg'', Berlin: Haude & Spener / Edition Luisenstadt, 2003, p.&nbsp;52. {{ISBN|3-7759-0474-3}}.</ref> The Z3 was a [[Binary numeral system|binary]] 22-bit [[floating point]] calculator featuring programmability with loops but without conditional jumps, with memory and a calculation unit based on telephone relays. The telephone relays used in his machines were largely collected from discarded stock. Despite the absence of conditional jumps, the Z3 was a [[Turing complete]] computer. However, Turing-completeness was never considered by Zuse (who had practical applications in mind) and only demonstrated in 1998 (see [[History of computing hardware]]).

The Z3, the first fully operational electromechanical computer, was partially financed by German government-supported DVL, which wanted their extensive calculations automated. A request by his co-worker [[Helmut Schreyer]]—who had helped Zuse build the Z3 prototype in 1938<ref>St. Amant, Kirk; Still, Brian. [https://books.google.com/books?id=75KT6GdcWbYC&pg=PA62&dq=z3,+nazi,+zuse&cd=5#v=onepage&q=z3%2C%20nazi%2C%20zuse&f=false ''Handbook of research on open source software''] Idea Group. 2007. {{ISBN|978-1-59140-999-1}}. Retrieved 14 March 2010.</ref>—for government funding for an electronic successor to the Z3 was denied as "strategically unimportant".

[[File:KZuse denkmal.jpg|thumb|right|Statue of Zuse in [[Bad Hersfeld]]]] In 1937, Schreyer had advised Zuse to use [[vacuum tube]]s as switching elements; Zuse at this time considered it a crazy idea ("Schnapsidee" in his own words). Zuse's workshop on Methfesselstraße 7 (with the Z3) was destroyed in an [[Bombing of Berlin in World War II|Allied Air raid in late 1943]] and the parental flat with Z1 and Z2 on 30 January the following year, whereas the successor [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]], which Zuse had begun constructing in 1942<ref name=MCML /> in new premises in the ''Industriehof'' on Oranienstraße 6, remained intact.<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 428">Hasso Spode, "Der Computer – eine Erfindung aus Kreuzberg, Methfesselstraße 10/Oranienstraße 6", in: ''Geschichtslandschaft Berlin: Orte und Ereignisse'': 5 vols., Helmut Engel, Stefi Jersch-Wenzel, Wilhelm Treue (eds.), vol.&nbsp;5: 'Kreuzberg', Berlin: Nicolai, 1994, pp.&nbsp;418–429, p.&nbsp;428. {{ISBN|3-87584-474-2}}.</ref> 

On 3 February 1945, aerial bombing caused devastating destruction in the [[Luisenstadt]], the area around Oranienstraße, including neighbouring houses.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kreuzberger-chronik.de/chroniken/2011/oktober/geschichten.html|title=Kreuzberger Chronik: Bomber Ã¼ber Kreuzberg – Sie lesen das Original! aus Berlin-Kreuzberg|first=Bernd Selig, Kreuzberger|last=Chronik|website=www.kreuzberger-chronik.de}}</ref> This event effectively brought Zuse's research and development to a complete halt. The partially finished, telephone relay-based Z4 computer was then packed and moved from Berlin on 14 February, arriving in [[Göttingen]] approximately two weeks later.<ref name="Spode Computer 1994 428" />

These machines contributed to the Henschel Werke [[Henschel Hs 293|Hs 293]] and [[Henschel Hs 294|Hs 294]] guided missiles developed by the German military between 1941 and 1945, which were the precursors to the modern [[cruise missile]].<ref name=MCML>{{Citation | last = Zuse | first = Konrad | author-link = Konrad Zuse | editor-last = Wössner | editor-first = Hans | title = The Computer – My Life (Translation of Der Computer – Mein Lebenswerk) | place = Heidelberg | publisher = Springer Verlag | orig-year = 1993 | year = 2010 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ro5JOskbChAC&q=konrad+zuse,+z4&pg=PA75 | isbn = 978-3-642-08151-4 }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wx7myVYenMcC&pg=PA51&dq=s1,+s2,+HS-293&cd=1#v=onepage&q=&f=false "Germany's Secret Weapons in World War II"], Roger Ford.

While working on his Z4 computer, Zuse realised that programming in [[machine code]] was too complicated. He started working on a PhD thesis.<ref>K.

===1945–1995===
After the 1945 Luisenstadt bombing, he flew from Berlin for the rural [[Allgäu]].{{cn|date=May 2020}} In the extreme privation of [[Allied-occupied Germany|post-war Germany]] Zuse was unable to build computers.

Zuse founded one of the earliest computer companies: the ''Zuse-Ingenieurbüro Hopferau''. Capital was raised in 1946 through [[ETH Zurich]] and an IBM option on Zuse's patents.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

In 1947, according to the memoirs of the German computer pioneer [[Heinz Billing]] from the [[Max Planck Institute for Physics]], there was a meeting between [[Alan Turing]] and Konrad Zuse in [[Göttingen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mathcomp.leeds.ac.uk/turing2012/Images/Turing_Zuse.pdf|title=Did Alan Turing interrogate Konrad Zuse in Göttingen in 1947?|author=Bruderer, Herbert |access-date= 7 February 2013}}</ref> The encounter had the form of a [[Academic conference|colloquium]]. Participants were [[John R. Womersley|Womersley]], Turing, Porter from England and a few German researchers like Zuse, Walther, and Billing. (For more details see Herbert Bruderer, ''Konrad Zuse und die Schweiz'').
 
It was not until 1949 that Zuse was able to resume work on the Z4. He would show the computer to the mathematician [[Eduard Stiefel]] of the [[ETH Zürich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich]] (''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule (ETH) Zürich'') who then ordered one in 1950. In November 1949, Zuse KG was founded and that Z4 was delivered to ETH Zurich in July 1950, and proved very reliable.<ref name="HZ2010-11-18" />

In 1949, Zuse founded another company, ''Zuse KG'' in [[Haunetal|Haunetal-Neukirchen]]; in 1957 the company's head office moved to [[Bad Hersfeld]]. The [[Z4 (computer)|Z4]] was finished and delivered to the [[ETH Zurich]], [[Switzerland]] in September 1950. At that time, it was the only working computer in continental Europe, and the second computer in the world to be sold, beaten only by the [[BINAC]], which never worked properly after it was delivered. Other computers, all numbered with a leading Z, up to Z43,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://epemag.com/zuse/part7e.htm |title=Part 7 (continued): The Zuse KG |access-date=4 July 2011 |url-status=unfit |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511021714/http://epemag.com/zuse/part7e.htm |archive-date=11 May 2009 }} Prof. Horst Zuse, EPE Online, archived on 11 May 2009 from [http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part7e.htm the original] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228103304/http://www.epemag.com/zuse/part7e.htm |date=28 December 2008 }}</ref> were built by Zuse and his company.

Unable to do any hardware development, he continued working on the Plankalkül, eventually publishing some brief excerpts of his thesis in 1948 and 1959; the work in its entirety, however, remained unpublished until 1972.<ref name="knuthpardo"/> The PhD thesis was submitted at [[University of Augsburg]], but rejected for formal reasons, because Zuse forgot to pay the 400 Mark university enrollment fee. The rejection did not bother him.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.get-it.tu-berlin.de/menue/werdegaenge/ursula_walk/|title=get-it: Ursula Walk|website=www.get-it.tu-berlin.de}}</ref>

Zuse. His notation was quite general, but the proposal never attained the consideration it deserved". Further implementations followed in 1998 and then in 2000 by a team from the [[Free University of Berlin]]. [[Donald Knuth]] suggested a [[thought experiment]]: What might have happened had the bombing not taken place, and had the PhD thesis accordingly been published as planned?<ref name=knuthpardo/>

[[File:Zuse Z64 Graphomat.jpg|alt=Z64 Graphomat plotter|thumb|Z64 Graphomat plotter]]
In 1956, Zuse began to work on a high precision, large format [[plotter]]. It was demonstrated at the 1961 [[Hanover Fair]],<ref name=HorstZuse>{{cite web|url=http://www.horst-zuse.homepage.t-online.de/z64.html|title=Graphomat Z64 (in German)|website=www.zuse.de}}</ref> and became well known also outside of the technical world thanks to [[Frieder Nake]]'s pioneering computer art work.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heikewerner.com/nake_en.html|title=Pioneer Work: Frieder Nake|website=www.heikewerner.com}}</ref> Other plotters designed by Zuse include the ZUSE Z90 and ZUSE Z9004.<ref name=HorstZuse/>

In 1967, Zuse suggested that the [[universe]] itself is running on a [[cellular automaton]] or similar computational structure ([[digital physics]]); in 1969, he published the book ''Rechnender Raum'' (translated into English as ''[[Calculating Space]]'').{{cn|date=May 2020}}

In the last years of his life,{{when|date=May 2020}} Zuse conceptualized and created a purely mechanical, extensible, modular tower automaton he named "helix tower" ("''Helixturm''"). The structure is based on a gear drive that employs rotary motion (e.g. provided by a crank) to assemble modular components from a storage space, elevating a tube-shaped tower; the process is reversible, and inverting the input direction will deconstruct the tower and store the components. The [[Deutsches Museum]] restored Zuse's original 1:30 functional model that can be extended to a height of 2.7 m.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deutsches-museum.de/en/exhibitions/communication/computers/automata/|title=Automata and punched card machines: Helix tower|publisher=Deutsches Museum|access-date=13 February 2019}}</ref> Zuse intended the full construction to reach a height of 120 m, and envisioned it for use with wind power generators and radio transmission installations.<ref>{{cite conference|last1=Bock|first1=T.|last2=Eibisch|first2=N.|year=2010|title=The helix tower by Konrad Zuse: Automated con- and deconstruction|conference=27th International Symposion on Automation and Robotics in Construction (ISARC)|location=Bratislava|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/266466169}}</ref>

Between 1987 and 1989, Zuse recreated the Z1, suffering a heart attack midway through the project. It cost 800,000&nbsp;[[Deutsche Mark|DM]], (approximately $500,000) and required four individuals (including Zuse) to assemble it. Funding for this [[retrocomputing]] project was provided by [[Siemens]] and a consortium of five companies.{{cn|date=May 2020}}

==Personal life==
[[File:Konrad Zuse Denkmal im Huenfelder Stadtpark.JPG|thumb|right|Zuse Memorial in [[Hünfeld]], Hessen]]
Konrad Zuse married Gisela Brandes in January 1945, employing a carriage, himself dressed in tailcoat and top hat and with Gisela in a wedding veil, for Zuse attached importance to a "noble ceremony". Their son [[Horst Zuse|Horst]], the first of five children, was born in November 1945.

While Zuse never became a member of the [[Nazi Party]], he is not known to have expressed any doubts or qualms about working for the Nazi war effort. Much later, he suggested that in modern times, the best scientists and engineers usually have to choose between either doing their work for more or less questionable business and military interests in a [[Deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]], or not pursuing their line of work at all.<ref>Zuse, Konrad. ''Der Computer, mein Lebenswerk [The Computer, My Life's Work]''. Berlin: Springer. 1984. page X. {{ISBN|978-3-540-13814-3}}</ref>

After Zuse retired, he focused on his hobby of painting.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://history-computer.com/konrad-zuse-biography-history-and-inventions/|title=Konrad Zuse – Biography, History and Inventions|publisher=History Computer|access-date=4 February 2021}}</ref>

Zuse was an atheist.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Man Who Invented the Computer: The Biography of John Atanasoff, Digital Pioneer|year=2010|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-385-52713-2|author=Jane Smiley|quote=Like Alan Turing, Zuse was educated in a system that focused on a child's emotional and philosophical life as well as his intellectual life, and at the end of school, like Turing, Zuse found himself to be something of an outsider—to the disappointment of his very conventional parents, he no longer believed in God or religion.|url=https://archive.org/details/manwhoinventedco00smil_0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Computer, My Life|year=1993|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-540-56453-9|pages=12–13|author=Konrad Zuse|quote=The only problem was that the progressive spirit at our school did not always correspond to my parents' ideas. This was particularly true for religious instruction, which now and again seemed even to us pupils to be rather too enlightened. After the 'Abitur' my parents wanted to go to communion with me; it was a terrible disappointment to them when I wouldn't go. They had lived under the illusion that I was a good student when it came to religion, too, which wasn't the case. ...I remember a poem presented by a student, which made a great impression on me. The essence of the poem read, "Basically, you are always alone". I have forgotten the name of the poet, but have often experienced the truth of these words in later life.}}</ref>

Zuse died on 18 December 1995 in [[Hünfeld]], Hesse (near [[Fulda]]) from heart failure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-konrad-zuse-1526795.html|title=OBITUARY : Konrad Zuse|author=Martin Campbell-Kelly|date=21 December 1995|work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref>

==Awards and honours==
Zuse received several awards for his work:
* ''[[Werner von Siemens Ring]]'' in 1964 (together with [[Fritz Leonhardt]] and [[Walter Schottky]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~history/Zuse.html|title=Konrad Zuse|website=ei.cs.vt.edu}}</ref>
* ''[[Harry H. Goode Memorial Award]]'' in 1965 (together with [[George Stibitz]])
* [[Wilhelm Exner Medal]] in 1969.<ref name="Editor 2015"/>
* ''[[Bundesverdienstkreuz]]'' in 1972 – ''Great Cross of Merit''
* ''[[Computer History Museum]] Fellow Award'' in 1999 "for his invention of the first program-controlled, electromechanical, digital computer and the first high-level programming language, [[Plankalkül]]."<ref>[http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Konrad,Zuse/ Konrad Zuse 1999 Fellow Award Recipient] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120703013338/http://www.computerhistory.org/fellowawards/hall/bios/Konrad,Zuse/ |date=3 July 2012 }} Computer History Museum</ref>

The [[Zuse Institute Berlin]] is named in his honour.

The [[Konrad Zuse Medal]] of the [[Gesellschaft für Informatik]], and the Konrad Zuse Medal of the Zentralverband des Deutschen Baugewerbes (Central Association of German Construction), are both named after Zuse.

A replica of the Z3, as well as the original Z4, is in the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[Munich]]. The [[Deutsches Technikmuseum Berlin|Deutsches Technikmuseum]] in [[Berlin]] has an exhibition devoted to Zuse, displaying twelve of his machines, including a replica of the [[Z1 (computer)|Z1]] and several of Zuse's paintings.

The 100th anniversary of his birth was celebrated by exhibitions, lectures and workshops.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.horst-zuse.homepage.t-online.de/horst-zuse-zuse-jahr-2010-html/english/index.html|title=Zuse-Jahr 2010|first=Irene|last=Zwernemann-Blech|website=www.horst-zuse.homepage.t-online.de}}</ref><ref>[http://www.sdtb.de/Medieninfo-Zuse-Jahr-2010-zum-100-Geburtstag-d.1642.0.html Zuse-Jahr 2010 – zum 100.
