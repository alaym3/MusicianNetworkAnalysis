==Early life==
Quincy Delight Jones Jr. was born in the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] on March 14, 1933, the son of Sarah Frances (died 1999), a bank officer and apartment complex manager,<ref name="Achievement">{{cite web|title= Quincy Jones Biography and Interview |website=achievement.org|publisher=[[American Academy of Achievement]]|url=https://www.achievement.org/achiever/quincy-jones/#interview}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/97/Quincy-Jones.html |title=Quincy Jones Biography (1933–) |publisher=Filmreference.com |access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref> and Quincy Delight Jones, a semi-professional baseball player and carpenter from [[Kentucky]].

[it has been] discovered that my father was half-Welsh}}</ref> With the help of author [[Alex Haley]] in 1972 and Latter-day Saint researchers in [[Salt Lake City]], Jones discovered that one of his mother's ancestors included [[James Lanier]], a relative of poet [[Sidney Lanier]]. Jones said, "He had a baby with my great-grandmother [a slave], and my grandmother was born there [on a plantation in Kentucky]. We traced this all the way back to the [[Lanier family tree|Laniers]], the same family as [[Tennessee Williams]]."<ref name="Achievement" /> Learning that the Lanier immigrant ancestors were [[Huguenots|French Huguenots]] who had court musicians among their ancestors, Jones attributed some of his musicianship to them.<ref name="Achievement"/>

For the 2006 [[PBS]] television program ''[[African American Lives]]'', Jones had his DNA tested, and genealogists researched his family history again. His DNA revealed he is mostly African, but also has 34% European ancestry on both sides of his family. Research showed that he has English, French, Italian, and Welsh ancestry through his father. His mother's side is of West and Central African descent, specifically the [[Tikar]] people of [[Cameroon]].<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.visitzambia.co.zm/eng/news/news/zambia_tourism_news_archives/new_dna_test_results_trace_oprah_winfrey_s_ancestry_to_liberia_zambia |title=New DNA test results trace Oprah Winfrey's ancestry to Liberia/Zambia | work = Zambia News |date=February 6, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110718173641/http://www.visitzambia.co.zm/eng/news/news/zambia_tourism_news_archives/new_dna_test_results_trace_oprah_winfrey_s_ancestry_to_liberia_zambia |archive-date=July 18, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> His mother also had European ancestry, including Lanier male ancestors who fought for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], making him eligible for membership in the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]].

Jones' family moved to Chicago during the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Jones had a younger brother, Lloyd, who was an engineer for the [[Seattle]] television station [[KOMO-TV]] until his death in 1998. Jones was introduced to music by his mother, who always sang religious songs, and by his next-door neighbor Lucy Jackson. When Jones was five or six, Jackson played stride piano next door, and he would listen through the walls. Lucy recalled that after he heard her one day, she could not get him off her piano.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/quincy-jones/the-story-of-an-american-musician/636/ |title=Quincy Jones: The Story of an American Musician|date=June 22, 2005|publisher=PBS|access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

In high school, he developed his skills as a trumpeter and arranger.<ref name="Achievement"/> His classmates included Charles Taylor, who played saxophone and whose mother, Evelyn Bundy, was one of Seattle's first society jazz bandleaders. Jones and Taylor began playing music together,<ref name="Catholic"/> and at the age of fourteen, they played with a National Reserve band. Jones said he got much more experience with music growing up in a smaller city because he otherwise would have faced too much competition.<ref name="Achievement"/>

At age 14, Jones introduced himself to 16-year-old [[Ray Charles]] after watching him play at the Black Elks Club. Jones cites Charles as an early inspiration for his own music career, noting that Charles overcame a disability (blindness) to achieve his musical goals. He credited his father's sturdy work ethic with giving him the means to proceed and his loving strength with holding the family together. Jones said his father had a rhyming motto: "Once a task is just begun, never leave until it's done. Be the labor great or small, do it well or not at all."<ref name="Catholic"/> In 1951, Jones earned a scholarship to [[Seattle University]], where a young [[Clint Eastwood]]{{emdash}}also a music major{{emdash}}watched him play in the college band. After one semester, Jones transferred to what is now the [[Berklee College of Music]] in [[Boston]] on another scholarship.<ref>{{cite news|title=Quincy Jones: Seattle's Own Music Man|url=http://northwestprimetime.com/news/2013/sep/01/quincy-jones/ |access-date=July 8, 2014 |publisher=Northwest Prime Time|date=September 1, 2013}}</ref> While studying at Berklee, he played at [[Izzy Ort's Bar & Grille]] with Bunny Campbell and Preston Sandiford, whom he cited as important musical influences.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Feist |first1=Jonathan|title=Masters of Music: Conversations with Berklee Greats |date=1999 |publisher=Berklee Press |isbn=9780634006425 |page=177 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9nrM5F_9kboC&pg=PA177 }}</ref> He left his studies after receiving an offer to tour as a trumpeter, arranger, and pianist with bandleader [[Lionel Hampton]] and embarked on his professional career. On the road with Hampton, he displayed a gift for arranging songs. He moved to New York City, where he received freelance commissions writing arrangements for [[Sarah Vaughan]], [[Dinah Washington]], [[Count Basie]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Gene Krupa]], and Ray Charles, who was by then a close friend.

==Music career==
In 1953, at age 20, Jones traveled with jazz bandleader Lionel Hampton for a European tour of the Hampton orchestra. He said the tour changed his view of racism in the United States:

{{cquote|It gave you some sense of perspective on past, present, and future. It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States and put it on another level because you saw the turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, and you saw it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul; it opened my mind.<ref name="Achievement"/>}}

In early 1956, Jones accepted a temporary job at the CBS Stage Show hosted by [[Jimmy Dorsey|Jimmy]] and [[Tommy Dorsey]] that was broadcast live from the Studio 50 in New York City. On January 28, February 4, 11, and 18, as well as on March 17 and 24, Jones played second trumpet in the studio band that supported 21-year-old [[Elvis Presley]] in his first six television appearances. Presley sang "Heartbreak Hotel", which became his first No. 1 record and the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine Pop Record of the year. Soon after, as a trumpeter and musical director for [[Dizzy Gillespie]], Jones went on tour of the Middle East and South America sponsored by the [[United States Information Agency]]. After returning, he signed a contract with [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]] and started his recording career as the leader of his band. In 1957, he settled in Paris, where he studied composition and theory with [[Nadia Boulanger]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] and performed at the [[Paris Olympia]]. He became music director at [[Barclay Records|Barclay]], a French record company and the licensee for [[Mercury Records|Mercury]] in France.

During the 1950s, Jones toured Europe with several jazz orchestras.{{which|date=June 2020}} As musical director of [[Harold Arlen]]'s jazz musical ''Free and Easy'', he took to the road again. A European tour closed in Paris in February 1960. With musicians from the Arlen show, he formed his big band "The Jones Boys" with eighteen musicians. The band included double bass player [[Eddie Jones (jazz musician)|Eddie Jones]] and trumpeter [[Reunald Jones]] (none of the three were related). The band toured North America and Europe, and the concerts met enthusiastic audiences and sparkling reviews, but the earnings failed to support a band of this size. Poor budget planning resulted in an economic disaster; the band dissolved, leaving Jones in a financial crisis.

"We had the best jazz band on the planet, and yet we were literally starving. That's when I discovered that there was ''music'', and there was the ''[[Music industry|music business]]''. If I were to survive, I would have to learn the difference between the two."<ref name="Gleason">{{cite book|last=Gleason|first=Ralph J. |title=Conversations in Jazz: The Ralph J.

In 1961, Jones was promoted as the vice-president of Mercury, becoming the first African American to hold the position. During the same year, at the invitation of director [[Sidney Lumet]], he composed music for ''[[The Pawnbroker (film)|The Pawnbroker]]'' (1964). It was the first of his nearly 40 major motion picture scores. Following the success of ''The Pawnbroker'', Jones left Mercury and moved to Los Angeles. After composing film scores for ''[[Mirage (1965 film)|Mirage]]'' and ''[[The Slender Thread]]'' in 1965, he was in constant demand as a composer. His film credits over the next seven years included ''[[Walk, Don't Run]]'', ''[[The Deadly Affair]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[In the Heat of the Night (film)|In the Heat of the Night]]'', ''[[Mackenna's Gold]]'', ''[[The Italian Job]]'', ''[[Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice]]'', ''[[Cactus Flower (film)|Cactus Flower]]'', ''[[The Out-of-Towners (1970 film)|The Out-Of-Towners]]'', ''[[They Call Me Mister Tibbs!]]'', ''[[The Anderson Tapes]]'', ''[[$ (film)|$ (Dollars)]]'', and ''[[The Getaway (1972 film)|The Getaway]]''. In addition, he composed "[[Sanford and Son Theme (The Streetbeater)|The Streetbeater]]", which became the theme music for the television sitcom ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', starring his close friend [[Redd Foxx]], and the themes for other TV shows, including ''[[Ironside (TV series)|Ironside]]'', ''[[Rebop (TV series)|Rebop]]'', ''[[Banacek]]'', ''[[The Bill Cosby Show]]'', the opening episode of ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[Mad TV]]'', and the game show ''[[Now You See It (U.S. game show)|Now You See It]]''.

In the 1960s, Jones worked as an arranger for [[Billy Eckstine]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Shirley Horn]], [[Peggy Lee]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Sarah Vaughan]], and [[Dinah Washington]]. His solo recordings included ''[[Walking in Space]]'', ''[[Gula Matari]]'', ''[[Smackwater Jack]]'', ''[[You've Got It Bad Girl]]'', ''[[Body Heat (Quincy Jones album)|Body Heat]]'', ''[[Mellow Madness]]'', and ''I Heard That!!''

Jones's 1962 tune "[[Soul Bossa Nova]]", which originated on the ''[[Big Band Bossa Nova]]'' album, was used for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>[https://img.cdandlp.com/2013/12/imgL/116320531-2.jpg Rear cover] of 1998 CD reissue of ''Big Band Bossa Nova''.</ref>

Jones produced all four million-selling singles for [[Lesley Gore]] during the early and mid-sixties, including "[[It's My Party (Lesley Gore song)|It's My Party]]" (UK No.&nbsp;8; US No.&nbsp;1), its sequel "[[Judy's Turn to Cry]]" (US No.&nbsp;5), "[[She's a Fool]]" (also a US No.&nbsp;5) in 1963, and "[[You Don't Own Me]]" (US No.&nbsp;2 for four weeks in 1964). He continued to produce for Gore until 1966, including the [[Ellie Greenwich|Greenwich]]/[[Jeff Barry|Barry]] hits "[[Look of Love (Lesley Gore song)|Look of Love]]" (US No.&nbsp;27 in 1965) and "Maybe I Know" (UK No.&nbsp;20; US No.&nbsp;14 in 1964).

In 1975, he founded Qwest Productions, for which he arranged and produced successful albums by Frank Sinatra and others. In 1978, he produced the soundtrack for ''[[The Wiz]]'', the musical adaptation of ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]'', which starred Michael Jackson and [[Diana Ross]]. In 1982, he produced Jackson's ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', the bestselling album in history of the music industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/quincy-jones-9357524?page=1|title=Quincy Jones|publisher=Biography.com|access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref>

His 1981 album ''[[The Dude (Quincy Jones album)|The Dude]]'' yielded the hits "[[Ai No Corrida (song)|Ai No Corrida]]" (a remake of a song by [[Chaz Jankel]]), "Just Once", and "One Hundred Ways", both sung by [[James Ingram]].

Marking Jones' debut as a film producer, 1985's [[The Color Purple (film)|''The Color Purple'']] received 11 [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] nominations that year, including one for Jones' score. Jones, [[Thomas Newman]], and [[Alan Silvestri]] are the only composers besides [[John Williams]] to have written scores for a [[Steven Spielberg]]-directed theatrical feature film.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/3/18/8243915/john-williams-not-scoring-spielberg-film |title=John Williams won't score a Steven Spielberg film for the first time in 30 years |date=March 18, 2015 |last=Kastrenakes |first=Jacob |publisher=The Verge |access-date=August 24, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-et-mn-ready-player-one-alan-silvestri-20180330-story.html |title=How 'Ready Player One' became the rare Steven Spielberg movie not scored by John Williams |date=March 30, 2018 |last=Greiving |first=Tim |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 1, 2021}}</ref> Additionally, through this picture, Jones is credited with introducing [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]] to film audiences around the world.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=http://www.quincyjones.com|title=Home – Quincy Jones|website=Quincy Jones|access-date=June 12, 2018}}</ref>

After the 1985 [[American Music Awards]] ceremony, Jones used his influence to draw most of the major American recording artists of the day into a studio to record the song "[[We Are the World]]" to raise money for the victims of famine in [[Ethiopia]]. When people marveled at his ability to make the collaboration work, Jones explained that he had taped a sign on the entrance reading "Check Your Ego at the Door". He was also quoted as saying, "We don't want to make a hunger record in tuxedos",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davidbreskin.com/books/we-are-the-world-books/a-week-of-no-sleep/|title=A Week of No Sleep|website=davidbreskin.com|date=February 4, 2014|access-date=February 18, 2018}}</ref> requiring all participants to wear casual clothing in the studio.

In 1990, Quincy Jones Productions joined with Time Warner to create Quincy Jones Entertainment.<ref name=":0" /> The company signed a 10-picture deal with Warner Bros. and a two-series deal with NBC Productions (now [[Universal Television]]). The television show ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' was completed in 1990, but producers of ''[[In the House (TV series)|In the House]]'' (from UPN) rejected its early concept stages. Jones produced the successful ''The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air'' (discovering [[Will Smith]]), UPN's ''In the House'', First-Run Syndication's ''[[The Jenny Jones Show]]'' (in association with [[Telepictures|Telepictures Productions]], 1994–1997 only) and FOX's ''[[Madtv]]''{{snd}}which ran for 14 seasons.<ref name="http://www.quincyjones.com/about">{{cite web |url=http://www.quincyjones.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=Quincy Jones |access-date=May 23, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714074053/http://www.quincyjones.com/about/ |archive-date=July 14, 2014  }}</ref> In the early 1990s, he started a huge, ongoing project called "The Evolution of Black Music".

Beginning in the late 1970s, Jones tried to convince [[Miles Davis]] to revive the music he recorded on several classic albums of the 1950s, which was arranged by [[Gil Evans]]. Davis always refused, citing a desire to avoid revisiting the past. But in 1991, Davis relented. Despite having pneumonia, he agreed to perform the music at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. The recording, ''[[Miles & Quincy Live at Montreux]]'', was his last album; he died several months afterward.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thigpen |first=David E. |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979336,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080306193400/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979336,00.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 6, 2008 |title=The Last Great Set |work=Time |date=October 4, 1993 |access-date=December 13, 2012}}</ref>

In 1993, Jones collaborated with [[David Salzman]] to produce the concert ''An American Reunion'', a celebration of [[Bill Clinton]]'s inauguration as President of the United States. During the same year, he and Salzman renamed his company to Quincy Jones/David Salzman Entertainment.

In 2001, Jones published his autobiography ''Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones''. On July 31, 2007, he partnered with Wizzard Media to start the Quincy Jones Video Podcast.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://quincyjones.com/ |title= Quincy Jones|publisher=quincyjones.com|date=August 25, 2008 |access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref> In each episode, he shares his knowledge and experience in the music industry. The first episode features him in the studio producing "I Knew I Loved You" for [[Celine Dion]]. This is included on the [[Ennio Morricone]] tribute album ''[[We All Love Ennio Morricone]]''.

Jones helped produce Anita Hall's 2009 album ''Send Love''. In 2013, he produced [[Emily Bear]]'s album ''Diversity''.

===Work with Frank Sinatra===
Quincy Jones first worked with [[Frank Sinatra]] in 1958 when invited by [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace]] to arrange a benefit concert at the Monaco Sporting Club.<ref>(Quincy Jones) ''Q: The Autobiography of Quincy Jones'', Doubleday, 2001, pp. 129–132.</ref> Six years later, Sinatra hired him to arrange and conduct Sinatra's second album with [[Count Basie]], ''[[It Might as Well Be Swing]]'' (1964). Jones conducted and arranged Sinatra's live album with the Basie Band, ''[[Sinatra at the Sands]]'' (1966).<ref>(Jones), pp. 179–83.</ref> Jones was also the arranger/conductor when Sinatra, [[Sammy Davis Jr.]], [[Dean Martin]], and [[Johnny Carson]] performed with the Basie orchestra in June 1965 in St. Louis, Missouri, in a benefit for Dismas House. The fund-raiser was broadcast to movie theaters around the country and eventually released on VHS.<ref>''Live and Swingin': The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection'', Reprise R2 73922, 2003 (CD & DVD).</ref> Later that year, Jones was the arranger/conductor when Sinatra and Basie appeared on ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'' TV show on October 16, 1965.<ref>video tape ''Frank Sinatra''.

===Work with Michael Jackson===
[[File:Michael Jackson gives autograph - supercropped.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Jones worked with [[Michael Jackson]] as a producer on ''[[Off the Wall]]'' (1979), ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'' (1982) and ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987).]]
While working on the film ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'', [[Michael Jackson]] asked Jones to recommend some producers for his upcoming solo album. Jones offered some names but eventually offered to produce the record himself. Jackson accepted and the resulting record, ''[[Off the Wall]]'', sold about 20 million copies. This made Jones the most powerful record producer in the industry at that time. Jones and Jackson's next collaboration, ''[[Thriller (Michael Jackson album)|Thriller]]'', sold 65 million copies and became the highest-selling album of all time.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/china/learningenglish/specials/1430_jackson_photo/page7.shtml |title=BBC China &#124; Michael Jackson Photo Gallery |publisher=BBC |access-date=August 17, 2011 }}</ref> The rise of [[MTV]] and the advent of music videos as promotional tools also contributed to ''Thriller's'' sales. Jones worked on Jackson's album ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'', which sold 45 million copies, and was the last time they worked with each other. Audio interviews with Jones are included in the 2001 special editions of ''Off the Wall'', ''Thriller'', and ''Bad''.

In a 2002 interview, when asked if he would work with Jones again, Jackson suggested he might. But in 2007, when Jones was asked by ''[[NME]]'', he said, "Man, please! We already did that. I have talked to him about working with him again but I've got too much to do. I've got 900 products, I'm 74 years old."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/michael-jackson/28551 |title=Quincy Jones snubs chance to team up with Michael Jackson |website=NME |author=Adam Bychawski|location=UK |date=May 25, 2007 |access-date=July 18, 2009}}</ref>

Following Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, Jones said:

{{quote|I am absolutely devastated at this tragic and unexpected news. For Michael to be taken away from us so suddenly at such a young age, I just don't have the words. Divinity brought our souls together on ''The Wiz'' and allowed us to do what we were able to throughout the '80s. To this day, the music we created together on ''Off the Wall'', ''Thriller'' and ''Bad'' is played in every corner of the world, and the reason for that is because he had it all ... talent, grace, professionalism, and dedication. He was the consummate entertainer, and his contributions and legacy will be felt upon the world forever.

In October 2013, the [[BBC]] and ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said Jones planned to sue Michael Jackson's estate for $10&nbsp;million. Jones said that MJJ Productions, a song company managed by Jackson's estate and Sony Music Entertainment, improperly re-edited songs to deprive him of royalties and production fees and breached an agreement giving him the right to remix master recordings for albums released after Jackson's death.<ref name="stone"/> The songs Jones produced for Jackson were used in the film ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It|This Is It]]''.

==Activism==
[[File:Quincy Jones 1997.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Jones in 1997]]
Jones' social activism began in the 1960s with his support of [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Jones is one of the founders of the Institute for Black American Music (IBAM), whose events aim to raise enough funds for the creation of a national library of African-American art and music. Jones is also one of the founders of the Black Arts Festival in his hometown of Chicago. In the 1970s, Jones formed The Quincy Jones Workshops. Meeting at the Los Angeles Landmark Variety Arts Center, the workshops educated and honed the skills of inner-city youth in musicianship, acting, and songwriting. Among its alumni were Alton McClain, who had a hit song with [[Alton McClain and Destiny]], and Mark Wilkins, who co-wrote the hit song "Havin' a Love Attack" with [[Mandrill (band)|Mandrill]] and became National Promotion Director for [[Mystic Records]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://interviewswithwriters.com/interview-with-author-mark-wilkins/ |title=Interview with Author – Mark Wilkins |date=July 4, 2016 |work=Interviews With Writers |access-date=January 25, 2018}}</ref>
