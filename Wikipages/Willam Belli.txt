In June 2019, a panel of judges from ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine placed her ninth on their list of "the most powerful drag queens in America", a ranking of 100 former ''Drag Race'' contestants.<ref name="nymag">{{cite news |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/most-powerful-drag-queens-in-america-ranked.html# |title=The Most Powerful Drag Queens in America: Ranking the new establishment. |author=The Editors |date=June 10, 2019 |access-date=June 10, 2019 |magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |archive-date=June 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610184458/https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/most-powerful-drag-queens-in-america-ranked.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Before appearing on ''Drag Race'', Willam worked as an actor, most notably playing the recurring role of [[transgender]] woman [[Cherry Peck]] in [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]]'s medical drama ''[[Nip/Tuck]]''. She has continued to perform in a variety of films, television series and web series, often in drag. In 2018, she appeared in the critically acclaimed film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. For her performance on the dark comedy web series ''[[EastSiders]]'', she was nominated for a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] for [[Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Digital Daytime Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Digital Daytime Drama Series]].<ref name="emmys">{{Cite web|url=https://theemmys.tv/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/2020.05.21-DTE-Release.v02.pdf|title=NOMINEES ANNOUNCED FOR THE 47TH ANNUAL DAYTIME EMMY® AWARDS|access-date=2020-05-23|website=theemmys.tv|publisher=[[National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]]}}</ref>

===2011–2012: ''RuPaul's Drag Race'' and further success===
[[World of Wonder (production company)|World of Wonder]] contacted Willam's management asking for him to audition for the [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[RuPaul's Drag Race]]''.<ref name="dirty"/> In November 2011, [[Logo TV]] announced that Belli was among 13 contestants competing on the fourth season.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jones|first=Arnold Wayne|title=Logo announces cast for Season 4 of 'RuPaul's Drag Race'|url=http://www.dallasvoice.com/logo-releases-cast-list-season-4-rupauls-drag-race-1094450.html|work=[[Dallas Voice]]| publisher =Voice Publishing Company, Inc|access-date=March 31, 2013|date=November 15, 2011}}</ref> Fellow castmate [[Chad Michaels]] had competed with Belli in the California Entertainer of the Year Pageant in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|last=Addams|first=Calpernia|title=California EOY 2010 – The Recap |url=http://www.calpernia.com/diary/california-eoy-2010-the-recap/|work=[[Calpernia Addams|Calpernia.com]] |access-date=March 30, 2013}}</ref> Belli won the main challenges in the episodes "Float Your Boat" and "Frenemies", but was disqualified in the latter.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sava|first=Oliver|title=Float Your Boat|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/float-your-boat,70257/|work=[[The A.V.

Belli's most recent reassertion is in an interview with YouTuber Joseph Shepherd in February 2019, where Belli claims that the 'so-called' official reason was just a fabrication by the show's creators for the purpose of portraying a more palatable scenario of Belli's departure from the show. In that interview Willam claimed that the genuine reason for his removal was due to increasing hostilities and issues between the contestants and the crew. Willam claims that many of the crew were rude and condescending towards the drag queens in general, with some of the crew members not even bothering to try to learn the contestant's names - sharing one example of a crew member repeatedly calling season 4 fellow contestant Latrice Royale - "La-something", despite all the crew having cards with the photographs of the queens/contestants (in and out of drag) worn around their necks. This led the queens to label some of the crew and their bad attitudes, plus some interactions between cast and crew, as being racist.

Willam also claimed that outside of filming hours the queens weren't being adequately fed, for example noting that $75 was all that was allocated to feed the 12 contestants, Willam claims that this necessitated visits to the store for food etc. Willam also revealed that he frequently got other contestants high and/or drunk, as well as also attempting to steal things from the set, things feather fans and RuPaul branded Iron fist shoes. According to Belli, the conjugal visit story was made up by producers and Willam agreed to "go along with the excuse" so that "everyone looked okay".<ref>{{Cite web|last=Willam|first=Belli|date=27 February 2019|title=WILLAM: EXPOSED (The Full Interview) - Part 1|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZW8pW9bURms|website=Youtube}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Bruno|first1=Paul|title=Willam Belli: How to Break the Rules|url=http://dirty-mag.com/v2/?p=12308|website=dirty-mag.com| publisher =Dirty Magazine|access-date=13 December 2014|date=May 2012|quote=I was doing a show off-broadway by that point!

The song featured [[Detox Icunt|Detox]] and Vicky Vox.<ref name="huffingtonpost">{{cite news|title=Willam Belli, RuPaul's Drag Race Star, Chats About Chick-fil-A and More|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lady-bunny/willam-belli-chick-fil-a_b_1698119.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|access-date=March 30, 2013|author=Lady Bunny|author-link=Lady Bunny|date=July 24, 2012}}</ref>

On March 21, Belli released "The Vagina Song", a parody of "[[Billionaire (song)|Billionaire]]" by [[Travie McCoy]] featuring [[Bruno Mars]] as his third single, which had been previously uploaded to YouTube in 2010.

On May 18, 2017, it was revealed that [[Fullscreen (company)|Fullscreen]] had ordered a talk show to be hosted by Belli. ''Suck Less'', billed as a weekly half-hour call-in show 'where Willam throws shade and shows how to slay the game of life in six-inch stilettos' is set to debut in the summer. Friends from Belli's everyday life, as well as some of his favorite drag queens are expected to put in guest appearances over the course of the 13-episode series.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/digital/news/willam-belli-fullscreen-talk-show-1202433682/|title=Drag Queen Star Willam Belli to Host Fullscreen Talk Show as Part of Gay-Pride Content Lineup|publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=18 May 2017|access-date=25 May 2017}}</ref>

===2018–present: ''A Star Is Born'' and other ventures===
In 2018, Willam appeared in the critically acclaimed film ''[[A Star Is Born (2018 film)|A Star Is Born]]''. Willam and fellow drag queen [[Shangela]] play queens working in a drag bar alongside [[Lady Gaga]]'s character Ally when she's discovered by famous country singer Jackson Maine, played by [[Bradley Cooper]]. Willam's character, Emerald, is a [[Dolly Parton]] impersonator who flirts with Jackson. The dialogue in his scenes was mostly improvised, including a memorable moment in which his character has Jackson autograph her silicone breastplate. [[Bradley Cooper]], who also directed the film, said that Willam and Shangela "blew his mind" with their ad-libbing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/drag-races-shangela-and-willam-in-a-star-is-born.html|title=How Shangela and Willam Dragged Up A Star Is Born

In 2019, Belli launched his own makeup line, Suck Less Face & Body.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allure.com/story/willam-belli-coverboy-makeup-brand-products|title=Drag Race Star Willam Belli Launched His Own Makeup Brand, and the Sparkle Is Absurd|publisher=[[Allure (magazine)|Allure]]|date=14 September 2019|access-date=15 October 2019}}</ref>

In 2021, Belli was announced as the star of ''Iconic Justice'', a courtroom show in which Belli will hear and rule on various legal and social disputes between LGBTQ people.<ref>Joey Nolfi, [https://ew.com/tv/willam-iconic-justice-trailer/ "Willam is now an official Judgey Judy in new court show Iconic Justice"].
