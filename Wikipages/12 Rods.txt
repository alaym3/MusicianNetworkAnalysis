'''12 Rods''' (also known by the stylistic variants '''12RODS''' and '''Twelve Rods''') is an [[indie rock]] band from [[Minneapolis]] [[Minnesota]]. The group was formed in [[Oxford, Ohio]] in 1992, later relocating to Minneapolis in 1995 where it was based until its disbandment in 2004. 

Aside from a one-off reunion show in 2015, the band remained inactive until 2021, when frontman Ryan Olcott announced on Facebook that he was making a new album under the 12 Rods name.

==History==
===1992: Formation===
An early incarnation of the group that would become 12 Rods was formed in Oxford, Ohio in May 1992, initiated by Talawanda High School student Ryan Olcott. Friends and fellow students [[Christopher McGuire]], Matt Flynn, and Daniel Perlin were included as members of the band. At this time, the group was known as Ryan'z Bihg Hed,<ref name=thomas>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypages.com/arts/end-of-the-road-end-of-the-rods-6694927 |title=End of the Road, End of the Rods |last=Thomas |first=Lindsey |publisher=City Pages |date=11 August 2004 |website=City Pages |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref> a name coined by Flynn in reference to Olcott's purported behavior during their rehearsals.{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The band prepared numerous songs for a performance early in the summer of 1992 at a local high school graduation party named "Field Fest 3". A cassette recording of this performance, titled ''Helikopter Hundrid Dolurz'', became their first release before the group disbanded until July 1992 when Olcott was invited to join a new group formed by McGuire, Flynn, and Daniel Burton-Rose at a performance at the end of the summer. Olcott accepted and the roster went on to name themselves "12RODS", a title discovered by Flynn in a passage from a children's Bible.<ref name=thomas/>

===1993–1995: Career beginnings and relocation===
The group independently released ''Bliss'' in 1993, their first album under the name 12 Rods, which was recorded in Minneapolis while the members were still living in Oxford.<ref name=thomas/> In 1996, one year after fully relocating to Minneapolis, the band released the EP ''gay?'', which went on to bring the group much-needed publicity following a review by an early ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' where it received one of the few 10.0 ratings given in the publication's history.<ref name=pitchforkgay>{{cite web |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22719-gay |title=12 Rods: Gay?: Pitchfork Record Review |last=Josephes |first=Jason |work=Pitchfork |date=1 May 1996 |access-date=11 January 2011 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/1030/20080406083852/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/22719-gay |archive-date=6 April 2008}}</ref> Former Pitchfork columnist Jason Josephes spoke of ''gay?'' favorably in his "Three Blocks from Groove Street" column after he and ''Pitchfork'' founder Ryan Schreiber saw 12 Rods' first Minneapolis concert and bought the EP.<ref name=Campbell>{{cite web |url=https://blog.thecurrent.org/2013/03/artist-of-the-month-12-rods/ |title=Artist of the Month: 12 Rods |last=Campbell |first=David |publisher=Minnesota Public Radio |date=5 March 2015 |website=The Current |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref>

===1996–2000: V2 Records era===
In 1996, 12 Rods became the first American act to sign to the newly founded [[V2 Records]],<ref name=thomas/> then a part of Richard Branson's [[Virgin Group]], where ''gay?'' was reissued, making it the group's first major label release. The band's next album ''Split Personalities'' was released in 1998 and was named in ''Pitchfork''{{'}}s first list of the best albums of the 1990s (although it was absent in the second version). Minneapolis musician Bill Shaw joined the group around this time, serving as its bassist until the end of the band's career.<ref name=Campbell/>

12 Rods released its next album, the [[Todd Rundgren]]-produced ''Separation Anxieties'', in 2000. Band members say Rundgren didn't do much during recording:

{{Quote|text=“All he would do was press the ‘record’ button and go back to doing crossword puzzles,” said Ev Olcott, who, like his brother, wound up producing records for other bands. “Some of those songs are good, but Todd Rundgren did the absolute worst job possible with that record,” Ryan Olcott sneered. “I would straight-up re-record that record before I’d reissue it.”|source=Star Tribune<ref name=Riemenschneider>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/10-years-later-12-rods-is-back/287990711/ |title=10 years later, 12 Rods is back |last=Riemenschneider |first=Chris |publisher=Star Tribune |date=1 January 2015 |website=Star Tribune |access-date=21 February 2018}}</ref>}}

The band was dropped by V2 Records following the album's release, which was a disappointment both critically and commercially. Local Minneapolis drummer [[David King (musician)|Dave King]] went on to be the group's drummer for most of the remainder of its career after McGuire's departure following the recording sessions for ''Separation Anxieties''.<ref name=Campbell/>

===2000–2004: Independent era and disbandment===
Jake Hansen joined the band in the summer of 2002 as an additional guitarist, and in 2003 George Marich took on drumming duties due to King's touring conflicts with [[The Bad Plus]].<ref name=thomas/> The group recorded and released one more album, 2002's self-released ''Lost Time'', then broke up in 2004.<ref name=Campbell/>

==''Lost Time'' reissue and brief reunion, documentary, and second reunion==
On September 7, 2011, it was announced on the website for [[Justin Vernon]]'s record label [[Chigliak]] that 12 Rods had an album awaiting release in the label's "first year of vinyl releases",<ref name=sundquist1>{{cite web |url=http://chigliak.com/about |title=About |last=Sundquist |first=Josh |date=7 September 2011 |website=Chigliak |access-date=12 March 2015}}</ref> which began on May 22, 2012, with Amateur Love's ''It's All Aquatic'', produced by Ev Olcott.<ref name=sundquist2>{{cite web |url=http://chigliak.com/its-all-aquatic-on-may-22 |title=It's All Aquatic on May 22 |last=Sundquist |first=Josh |date=22 March 2012 |website=Chigliak |access-date=12 March 2015}}</ref>

On October 8, 2014, 12 Rods announced via [[Facebook]] that Chigliak would be reissuing ''Lost Time'' on January 20, 2015, and the band would be playing a reunion show at [[First Avenue (nightclub)|First Avenue]] in Minneapolis on January 16, 2015 with Ryan Olcott, Ev, Christopher McGuire, Matthew Foust, Matt Flynn, Tal Tahir, Bill Shaw, Dave King, and Jake Hanson.<ref name=Reed>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2014/10/12_rods_announce_january_reunion_show.php |title=12 Rods Announce January Reunion Show |last=Reed |first=Fischer |publisher=City Pages |date=8 October 2014 |website=City Pages |access-date=12 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150301010251/http://blogs.citypages.com/gimmenoise/2014/10/12_rods_announce_january_reunion_show.php |archive-date=1 March 2015 |df= }}</ref>

James Francis Flynn filmed the reunion show as part of a documentary about 12 Rods. Throughout the summer and fall of 2015 he completed gathering the interviews and additional footage for the documentary titled "Accidents Waiting to Happen". The film, modeled after Martin Scorsese's "The Last Waltz", was funded by a Kickstarter campaign<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2080825908/accidents-waiting-to-happen-the-12-rods-story |title=Accidents Waiting to Happen: The 12 Rods Story by James Francis Flynn}}</ref> and was shown at the Minneapolis Saint Paul International Film Festival in April 2017.<ref name=Gerth>{{cite web |url=http://citypages.com/music/12-rods-documentary-remembers-what-might-have-been/419631543 |title=12 Rods documentary remembers what might have been |last=Gerth |first=Austin |publisher=City Pages |date=20 April 2017 |website=City Pages |access-date=3 March 2018}}</ref>

In September 2021, Ryan Olcott announced via the band’s Facebook page that he was making a new 12 Rods record with “zero help, zero support and zero financing”.

==After 12 Rods==

Ev went on to play in [[Halloween, Alaska]] and The Few Nice Words, and co-founded audio software company Audiofile Engineering.
