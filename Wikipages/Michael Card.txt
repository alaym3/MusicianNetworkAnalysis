==Career==
Card was born in [[Madison, Tennessee]]. He is the son of a doctor and the grandson of a Baptist minister.<ref name="ECCM"/> He received bachelor's and master's degrees in [[biblical studies]] from [[Western Kentucky University]], and was awarded university's ''Distinguished Alumni Award'' in 1997.<ref name="ECCM"/> His studies in [[physics]] and [[astronomy]] led to a job at a [[planetarium]], allowing Card to fund his education. In 2005,{{update after|2013|3|6}} Card worked on a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctorate of Philosophy]] (PhD) in [[Classics|Classical Literature]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Sacred Sorrow Experience Guide: Reaching Out to God in the Lost Language of Lament|last=Card|first=Michael|publisher=NavPress|year=2005|isbn=1576836681|pages=Back cover}}</ref>

===Musician===
Card got his start as a professional musician when his professor and mentor, [[William L. Lane]], asked him to write some music to accompany weekly sermons at their church. Card's friend and fellow musician, [[Randy Scruggs]], then requested that Card record a demo tape to help Scruggs get a job as a producer. The record label agreed to hire Scruggs as long as his first project featured Card. Since then, Card has released thirty two original albums and six compilation albums. Card's project, ''Starkindler'', is composed of Card's interpretations of traditional [[Celtic music|Celtic]] [[hymn]]s. The compilations often include one or two new songs along with previously released material. With the exception of ''Starkindler'' and ''Hymns'', Card writes a vast majority of the music he records.

Many of Card's albums are structured around a unifying theme. The songs from ''The Beginning'' are all based on the [[Pentateuch]]. The individual songs have subjects such as [[Genesis (Hebrew Bible)|Genesis]], [[Leviticus]], [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Moses]]. Card is particularly adept at relating difficult or obscure concepts from the [[Old Testament]] to more understandable themes from the [[New Testament]]. The song ''Jubilee'' concerns the period of rest and the release from debts and slavery commanded in the [[Jubilee (Biblical)|Jubilee]] year as described in [[Leviticus]] 25, but also relates to the rest and freedom from condemnation offered through Jesus.

Card's most famous song is "[[El Shaddai (song)|El Shaddai]]", which was also recorded by [[Amy Grant]]. Grant's recording was named No. 326 on the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]'s list of 365 [[Songs of the Century]] in 2001. Other popular Card songs include ''Immanuel'', ''Joy in the Journey'', and ''Heal Our Land''. ''Heal Our Land'' was commissioned as the 1993 [[National Day of Prayer]]'s theme song.

Despite his success in music, Card has always maintained that his music career is secondary to his calling as a Bible teacher. He has distanced himself from the [[Contemporary Christian music|CCM industry]] by criticizing the promotion of personalities over musical content<ref>[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/3505/cardconv.html&date=2009-10-25+05:59:59 Conversations/Michael Card, CCM 12/95]</ref> and the shifting emphasis away from God to sell more albums.<ref name="CCLI">{{cite news

</ref>

In 2008, alongside the By/For Project, Card produced and contributed vocals and songs to the album ''Sweet Sacrifice'', collaborating with Seattle, Washington based artists Brian Moss, Molly McCue, and Kurt Dyrhsen. The album was made available for free on ByFor.org<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.byfor.org/project_sweet_sacrifice.html|title=Project: Sweet Sacrifice|website=www.byfor.org|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref> under a Creative Commons Attribution license.

In 2019, Card released the album, ''To the Kindness of God'', featuring 7 new original songs, 2 hymn covers, and one new arrangement of one of Card's earlier songs, "Song of Gomer" (here renamed "Gomer's Song"), which first appeared on the album ''The Word: Recapturing the Imagination''. Prior to its release, Card announced that it would be his final full-length album, but also clarifying that he was not yet retiring from music in general, or writing new music.

===Author===
Michael Card is the author or co-author of twenty-two books. He originally started writing as a way to share the knowledge he accumulated while researching his songs. He found his studies were too in-depth to condense everything he had learned into one short piece. The books that resulted from album research bear the same titles as the albums. He then branched out to other subjects not specifically based on his music, such as the [[Gospel of John]], [[homeschooling]], and Christian discipleship and mentoring. In 2014, Card completed the Biblical Imagination Series, a four-volume set which takes a deeper look at each of the gospels and the voice of the writers behind them. He followed up on the Biblical Imagination Series next by releasing a new book (and album) on the subject of the Hebrew word 
{{lang|he|חֶסֶד}} (''ḥesed''), an idea which he first explored in his two books on lament (''A Sacred Sorrow'' and ''The Hidden Face of God''). The book is about the bibliography of the word throughout the Old Testament,<ref>{{cite book |title=Inexpressible Hesed and the Mystery of God's Lovingkindness |url=https://www.ivpress.com/inexpressible |website=InterVarsity Press |access-date=18 September 2020}}</ref> and how we can start to understand this word that is so often used to describe God and cannot be precisely expressed in the English language by the context in which it is used. The book was called ''Inexpressible: Hesed and the Mystery of God's Lovingkindness'', and was released at the end of 2018.

===Radio host===
In addition to touring and writing, Card also hosted a weekly radio program, ''In the Studio with Michael Card.'' It was carried by stations in 48 states, Canada, and the Caribbean. It was also available via Internet streaming audio and as a podcast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/in-the-studio-with-michael-card/id1315515483?mt=2|title=In the Studio with Michael Card by Michael Card on Apple Podcasts|website=Apple Podcasts|access-date=January 14, 2019}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=January 2019}} The show was an amalgam of talk, musical performances, and Bible study. The show ceased production in March 2009 but was then revived in the form of a podcast on June 18, 2018, with a mix of completely new and classic material.

==Controversies==
In 1996, Michael Card caused some concern within his primarily [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] fan-base by co-releasing an album (''Brother to Brother'') as well as touring with musician, [[John Michael Talbot]]. Some fans and critics felt betrayed by the collaboration since Card is known for lyrics that scrupulously adhere to [[Protestant]] theology whereas Talbot is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].<ref>Christianity Today magazine: [http://ctlibrary.com/1052 Churches Tune Out Ecumenical Duet]</ref>

On November 14, 2004, Card provided the music for a sermon by [[Ravi Zacharias]] at [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]' [[Salt Lake Tabernacle|Tabernacle]] in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. In coverage of the event, a [[Deseret Morning News]] reporter wrote the following:
<blockquote>Still, Card said, he doesn't see Mormonism and evangelical Christianity as opposed to each other. They are more like the two ends of a long thread—part of the same thing.<ref>Deseret News: [http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,595104824,00.html Songwriter puts faith to music and verse]</ref></blockquote>

Since the statement was not a direct quote, some have surmised that Card was misunderstood, which turned out to be accurate. The impact of this statement can be understood in the context that many Protestants and Catholics [[Mormonism and Christianity|categorize Mormons as outside Christianity]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/what-does-the-catholic-church-say-about-the-practices-and-beliefs-of-mormonism|title=What does the Catholic Church say about the practices and beliefs of Mormonism?|publisher=Catholic Answers|access-date=August 17, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930091050/http://www.catholic.com/quickquestions/what-does-the-catholic-church-say-about-the-practices-and-beliefs-of-mormonism|archive-date=September 30, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> and consider the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS church]] a [[cult]].

Card's response to his critics online<ref>[http://www.michaelcard.com/forum_1/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=731#4568 The Michael Card Forum: topic: Salt Lake Tabernacle, deseretnews.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008085150/http://www.michaelcard.com/forum_1/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=731#4568 |date=October 8, 2007 }}</ref> did satisfy some, since it denied the quote and the LDS interviewer later admitted to rewording Card's statement somewhat interpretively.

Jerry Johnson, the author of the article on Michael Card in ''Deseret News'', later admitted:
<blockquote>
The word Michael used was "continuum". He said that he thought the tensions between the LDS Church and the Evangelicals was because the LDS Church was on one end of the "continuum" and Evangelicals on the other.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://michaelcard.com/discussions/index.php?action=printpage;topic=731.0 |access-date=August 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171542/http://www.michaelcard.com/discussions/index.php?action=printpage%3Btopic%3D731.0 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref></blockquote>
