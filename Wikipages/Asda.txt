'''Asda Stores Ltd.''' ({{IPAc-en|'|æ|z|d|ə}}) (often stylised as '''ASDA''') is a British [[supermarket]] chain. It is headquartered in [[Leeds]], England.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://your.asda.com/section-contact-asda |title=Contact the right service team |publisher=Asda |access-date=20 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722100737/http://your.asda.com/section-contact-asda |archive-date=22 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The company was founded in 1949 when the Asquith family merged their retail business with the Associated Dairies company of Yorkshire. It expanded into [[Southern England]] during the 1970s and 1980s, and acquired [[Allied Carpets]], 61 large [[Gateway Supermarket]]s and other businesses, such as [[MFI Group]]. It sold these acquisitions during the 1990s to concentrate on the supermarkets. It was listed on the [[London Stock Exchange]] until 1999 when it was acquired by [[Walmart]] for £6.7&nbsp;billion. Asda was the second-largest supermarket chain in the [[United Kingdom]] between 2003 and 2014 by market share, at which point it fell into third place.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/apr/02/sainsburys-asda-uk-supermarket-aldi-lidl |title=Sainsbury's falls behind Asda to become UK's third biggest supermarket chain |date=2 April 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=8 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="ASDA Second">{{cite news |title=Market share of grocery stores in Great Britain for the 12 weeks ending March 29, 2015 |work=[[Statista]] |url=http://www.statista.com/statistics/279900/grocery-market-share-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117022207/http://www.statista.com/statistics/279900/grocery-market-share-in-the-united-kingdom-uk/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 January 2014 }}</ref>

Besides its core supermarkets, the company also offers assistance for insurance and payment services and a [[mobile phone]] provider. 

In February 2021, the Issa brothers and [[TDR Capital]] acquired Asda.

==History==
===Early years===
The Asquith family were [[butcher]]s based in [[Knottingley]], [[City of Wakefield|Wakefield]], West Yorkshire. In the 1920s, they expanded their business to seven butchers shops in the area. Their sons, Peter and Fred, later became founding members of Asda.<ref name=asquith>{{cite news|url=https://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/obituaries/peter-asquith-1-2503706|title=Obituary: Peter Asquith|newspaper=Yorkshire Post|date=14 June 2008|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

Around the same time, a group of [[West Riding]] dairy farmers, including the Stockdale family and Craven Dairies, joined together under the banner of J.W Hindell Dairy Farmers Ltd. The company diversified in 1949 to become Associated Dairies and Farm Stores Ltd, with Arthur Stockdale as the managing director.<ref name=noel>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1453806/Sir-Noel-Stockdale.html|title=Obituary: Sir Noel Stockdale|date=9 February 2004|publisher=The Telegraph|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

===1960s and 1970s===
In 1963, the Asquith brothers converted an old cinema, the Queens in [[Castleford]], into a self-service supermarket. Another followed in the old indoor market at [[Edlington]]. Both stores traded under the name of 'Queens'. Their next store was a purpose-built supermarket in [[South Elmsall]], a town in which Asda has a distribution centre to this day.<ref name=asquith/>

In 1965, the Asquith brothers approached Associated Dairies to run the butchery departments within their small store chain. A merger was proposed and the Asquiths' business was joined with [[Noel Stockdale]]'s to form a new company, Asda ('''As'''quith + '''Da'''iries) (capitalised from 1985).<ref name=noel/>

By 1967, the company had set up a store in [[Billingham]], [[County Durham]]. By 1969, Noel Stockdale bought out the Asquith brothers' stake and became chairman of the company.<ref name=noel/>

Asda took advantage of the abolition of [[retail price maintenance]] to offer large-scale, low-cost supermarkets. This was aided by the decision to acquire three struggling US-owned branches in the mid-1960s of the GEM retail group. The Government Exchange Mart stores in [[Preston, Lancashire]], [[Cross Gates, Leeds]] and West Bridgford had accumulated losses of £320,000 and offered to sell the stores for 20% of whatever Asda could recoup as losses from the [[Inland Revenue]]. They received the whole amount back. The rent was only 10 shillings (50p) per square foot on a 20-year lease, with no rent reviews, Asda increased GEM's £6,000 per week sales to around £60,000 per week in just six months with the new stores named as Asda.<ref name="outoftown">{{cite news|last=Kelly |first=Jon |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-23900465 |title=How first out-of-town superstore changed the UK |publisher=BBC|work=BBC News |date=3 September 2013 |access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://your.asda.com/about-asda/the-history-of-asda |title=Asda through the years - ASDA.com |access-date=24 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150422102646/http://your.asda.com/about-asda/the-history-of-asda |archive-date=22 April 2015 }}</ref>

During the 1970s, with over 30 stores in the north of England, Asda began expanding south, with the opening of new stores in the [[Estover]] area of [[Plymouth]], [[Devon]] and [[Gosport]], [[Hampshire]] in 1977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://christchurchgosport.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/christ_church_history.pdf|title=Christ Church, Gosport: A history |page=22 |year=2009|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> In 1978, Asda acquired [[Allied Carpets]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/1999/aug/29/highstreetretailers.observerbusiness|title=Trapped in a shag pile time warp|date=29 August 1999|work=The Guardian|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

In 1982, the first [[London]] store opened until 1982, in [[Park Royal]], near [[Ealing]]. The [[Isle of Dogs]] and [[Charlton, London]] stores followed on rapidly thereafter.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://charltonchampion.co.uk/2016/02/18/goodbye-asda-hello-housing-new-greenwich-council-consultation-offers-clues-to-charlton-riverside-plans/ |title=Goodbye Asda, hello housing? New Greenwich Council consultation offers clues to Charlton Riverside plans |date=18 February 2016| publisher=Charlton Champion |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

===1980s & 1990s===
In 1984, Managing Director, John Hardman, made attempts to halt Asda's decline, which included the introduction of Asda branded products.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hardman's race to catch up Asda's rivals| work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/11922353.hardmans-race-to-catch-up-asdas-rivals-goes-on-apace/ |date=11 July 1989|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> In 1985, Asda merged with MFI (Mullard Furniture Industries) and the group was renamed Asda-MFI Group plc.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/4649684/40-years-of-MFI.html |title=40 years of MFI| date=22 September 2006|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

Asda established its headquarters at "Asda House". The site was officially opened in 1988 by the then Prime Minister, [[Margaret Thatcher]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.margaretthatcher.org/document/107408 |title=Remarks visiting ASDA HQ ("we can make the best things in Britain") |publisher=[[Margaret Thatcher]] | date=7 December 1988}}</ref>

By the end of the 1990s, the 'Asdale'-named clothing range was replaced by the clothing ranges from the newly formed [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]] partnership with Asda.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/george-surprises-asda-departure/12239 | title=George surprises Asda with departure |date=10 November 2000 | publisher=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign]] |access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

====Near bankruptcy and merger prospects====
With stores mainly based in the [[North of England]], the newly focused food retail group expanded further south in 1989 by purchasing the large format stores of rival Gateway Superstores for £705&nbsp;million. This significantly increased Asda's total selling area, but the company had borrowed heavily in order to fund the purchase - city estimates suggested that Asda had overpaid by around £300&nbsp;million for 61 of the largest Gateway stores, two undeveloped store sites and a distribution centre. That was far above the net book value of the locations, some of which were poorly sited. (Asda has subsequently relocated or rebuilt more than 30 of the original Gateway stores since the late 1990s.) The move left the company overstretched as a result, and by 1991, it found itself in serious financial trouble with over £1 billion of debt; compounding the situation further was a declining customer base, which was mainly caused by Asda's focus on moving upmarket resulting in prices rising to levels significantly higher than competitors.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/uk-asdas-open-plan/article/410110 | title=UK: ASDA'S OPEN PLAN |first=Anita | last=van de Vliet | work=[[Management Today]] | url-access=subscription}}</ref>

Eventually, a combination of flagging profits, a tremendous debt and a loss of customers left Asda in such an egregious financial situation that they came very close to breaching their banking covenants; at one point, they almost entered [[Administration in United Kingdom law|administration]]. The company's first response was to change its management; chairman John Hardman was ousted in June 1991 and was replaced by Patrick Gillam, and [[Archie Norman (businessman)|Archie Norman]] was appointed chief executive in October. Asda then completed a rights issue in November 1991 that raised £357&nbsp;million and cut the company's debts to £668&nbsp;million. In May 1992, Asda reduced their prices back to their traditional level (5-7% below competitors) and announced that they would eliminate over 500 management positions. In 1993, Asda completed a second rights issue that raised a further £347&nbsp;million and began selling off some of its assets; some stores were sold to competitors, and the [[Allied Carpets]] chain was notably sold to Carpetland. By 1995, the company had returned to profitability and had virtually wiped out its debt - this is cited as one of the most successful turnarounds in British retail history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asda Group Plc |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/economics-business-and-labor/businesses-and-occupations/asda-group-plc |website=Encyclopedia.com |access-date=16 June 2020}}</ref>

Norman succeeded Gillam as chairman upon the latter's retirement in 1996, appointing then-deputy [[Allan Leighton]] as chief executive, and began to remodel Asda's stores along the lines of [[Walmart]], the world's largest retailer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deloitte.com/dtt/press_release/0,1014,cid%253D196099,00.html|title=Global powers of retail report – wal mart remains world's largest global retailer|website=Deloitte & Touche|access-date=7 October 2008}}{{Dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> Leighton travelled to [[Bentonville, Arkansas]] to assess and photograph the systems and marketing deployed by Walmart.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.managementtoday.co.uk/mt-interview-allan-leighton/article/492063 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205095240/http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/search/article/492390/mt-interview-allan-leighton/ |url-status=live |archive-date=5 December 2008 |title=The MT interview: Allan Leighton | first=Chris |last=Blackhurst | website=[[Management Today]] |date=25 August 2005 | url-access=subscription}}</ref> In 1998, following the Walmart model, Asda began opening larger 'Hypermarket' (later 'Supercentre') stores as well as introducing pharmacies and cafes to its stores. At the same time, merger discussions were taking place between Asda and other retailers such as [[Safeway (UK)|Safeway]] and [[Kingfisher plc]]; both collapsed without an agreement being reached, but in 1999, a second round of discussions with Kingfisher later reached an agreement for a £5.4&nbsp;billion merger that would have both created the United Kingdom's largest multi-category retailer and enabled Asda to begin operating stores throughout Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/asda-kingfisher-multi-billion-pound-merger/42283 |title=Asda and Kingfisher in multi-billion pound merger|date=16 April 1999 |publisher=[[Campaign (magazine)|Campaign Live]]}}</ref>

===2000s & 2010s: Walmart years===
A merger deal was abandoned when Walmart outbid Kingfisher to purchase Asda for £6.7&nbsp;billion, which was completed on 26 July 1999<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/368430.stm | work=BBC News | title=Wal-Mart bids for Asda | date=14 June 1999}}</ref> in a move that was initially speculated by British media outlets as a potential [[corporate raid]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Wal-Mart says 'no' to UK |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/331072.stm |agency=[[BBC News]] |date=29 April 1999}}</ref> Shortly after the takeover, Norman resigned as chairman and left the company to pursue his political career; he was succeeded as chairman by Leighton.

In 2005, amid reported concerns within Walmart about a slippage in market share, partially due to a resurgent [[Sainsbury's]], Asda's chief executive, [[Tony De Nunzio]] left, and was replaced by [[Andrew James Bond|Andy Bond]]. In 2005, Asda expanded into Northern Ireland by purchasing 12 former [[Safeway Stores (Ireland)|Safeway stores]] from [[Morrisons]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.4ni.co.uk/northern-ireland-news/41262/asda-acquires-12-ni-safeway-stores |title=Asda acquires 12 NI Safeway stores |website=Northern Ireland News |date=6 June 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.businesspost.ie/legacy/asda-eyes-up-the-republic-c1e03c31 |title=Asda eyes up the Republic | first=Ian | last=Kehoe | work=[[Business Post]] | date=11 June 2005

Asda's [[property development]] arm, Gazeley Limited, was sold to Economic Zones World (EZW), a [[Dubai World]] subsidiary, in June 2008 for in excess of £300m.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.propertyweek.com/news/dubai-world-buys-gazeley/3115513.article |title=Dubai World buys Gazeley| first=Jennifer |last=Rigby |website=[[Property Week]] |date=10 June 2008}}</ref>

In November 2008, there were reports that Asda was to buy Irish retailer [[Dunnes Stores]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.independent.ie/business/dunnes-urged-to-clarify-rumours-of-asda-takeover-26489747.html |title=Dunnes urged to clarify rumours of Asda takeover | work=[[Irish Independent]] | date=4 November 2008}}</ref>

In April 2010, Asda announced plans to open over 100 new non-food stores as part of an ambitious five-year plan. These plans were mothballed shortly after because of the recession and the reining in of spending by consumers on non-food purchases.<ref name="test">{{cite web |url=https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/2010/04/asda-takes-aim-tesco-new-stores |title=Asda takes aim at Tesco with new stores | work=[[New Statesman]] | date=16 April 2010}}</ref>

In August 2009, Walmart sold Asda for £6.9&nbsp;billion to its Leeds-based investment subsidiary Corinth Services Limited.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6527054/Wal-Mart-sells-Asda-for-6.9bn-in-group-restructuring.html |title=Wal-Mart 'sells' Asda for £6.9bn in group restructuring|date=8 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|access-date=11 November 2009 | first=Richard | last=Tyler| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091111001953/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/6527054/Wal-Mart-sells-Asda-for-6.9bn-in-group-restructuring.html| archive-date= 11 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The deal was described as part of a "group restructuring" and meant Asda remained under the control of Walmart, since Corinth is itself a Walmart subsidiary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.retail-week.com/city/trading-update/asda-posts-flat-profits-and-is-sold-in-internal-walmart-deal/5007872.article|title=Asda posts flat profits and is 'sold' in internal Walmart deal|date=9 November 2009|website=Retail Week|publisher=Emap Ltd| access-date=11 November 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091112134131/http://www.retail-week.com/city/trading-update/asda-posts-flat-profits-and-is-sold-in-internal-walmart-deal/5007872.article| archive-date= 12 November 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

He became CMO (Chief Merchandising Officer), in January 2018, and was put in charge of the fresh food and general merchandise offer within all stores. After reportedly clashing with Roger Burnley and only six months in his post, Lorente left Asda at the end of July 2018.

====Abandoned merger with Sainsbury's====
In April 2018, Sainsbury's and Walmart announced negotiations about a possible merger of Sainsbury's and Asda, creating the largest supermarket chain in the UK.<ref>{{cite news|last=Tovey|first= Alan |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2018/04/28/sainsburys-mulls-asda-tie-up-create-supermarket-giant/ |title=Sainsbury's in 'advanced' discussions over £10bn-plus merger with Asda to create supermarket giant |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=28 April 2018 |access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref> Under the plans, Walmart would own 42% of the combined business,<ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coupe on creating a dynamic new player in UK retail | url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?t=10s&v=tHvvH0E7hdM |date=30 April 2018|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> which would be led by the existing chief executive of Sainsbury's, Mike Coupe. The group would also open branches of [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] within Asda stores. The merger underwent intense scrutiny by a cross-party group of MPs, chairing select committees for the proposed merger, along with the Competition and Markets Authority, investigating the impact of how the deal could negatively affect the retail industry by a possible reduction of consumer choice for shoppers resulting in price rises, and of how suppliers, especially smaller, family-owned companies could be squeezed by the combined group. The CMA were inundated with complaints by suppliers and other major retailers of the damage they felt would be inflicted upon them if the deal was approved.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sainsbury's vows Asda deal will cut prices|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43945254|access-date=30 April 2018|work=BBC News|date=30 April 2018}}</ref> On 25 April 2019 the CMA blocked the proposed merger, suggesting that it would increase prices for consumers and make competition unfair for the other UK retailers, Sainsbury's then announced that it was abandoning the merger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/news/219067/sainsbury-s-and-walmart-s-asda-abandon-merger-after-competition-watchdog-rejects-deal-219067.html|title=Sainsbury's and Walmart's Asda abandon merger after competition watchdog rejects deal|date=25 April 2019|website=Proactiveinvestors UK|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

===Acquisition by the Issa brothers and TDR Capital===
In February 2021, [[Mohsin Issa]], [[Zuber Issa]] and [[TDR Capital]] acquired Asda. Walmart retains "an equity investment" in Asda, a seat on the board and "an ongoing commercial relationship".<ref name=":0" />

In February 2021, Asda said that it might need to put 5,000 jobs at risk as part of reconstruction plan in the context of people shopping online.<ref>{{cite news|date=25 February 2021|title=Asda says 5,000 jobs at risk in new business plan|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-56185236|access-date=25 February 2021}}</ref>

===Asda Supercentres===
Following the takeover by Walmart, several "Asda Walmart Supercentres" have been opened, creating some of the largest hypermarkets in the United Kingdom. Since 2006, all new Supercentres have been solely branded as ''Asda Supercentre'' without the Walmart branding. The first Supercentre with a sales area of {{convert|93000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}} opened in Patchway, Bristol in the summer of 2000. The first Scottish Supercentre opened in [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], in 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.just-food.com/news/scotlands-first-asda-wal-mart-supercentre_id87409.aspx|title=UK: Scotland's first ASDA Wal-Mart supercentre|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref> The [[Bletchley]], [[Milton Keynes]] Supercentre which opened in November 2005 is currently the largest Asda Supercentre with a net sales floor of over {{convert|120000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rpsl.com/news.php?id=89 |title=Rose :: Latest News |publisher=Rpsl.com |access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref> This was preceded in June 2002 by the Eastlands, Manchester store which was the largest store at the time with a sales area of {{convert|110000|sqft|m2|abbr=on|order=flip}} but is currently the second largest Asda Supercentre, and the third largest is located in [[Minworth]], West Midlands, followed by Patchway.

===Asda Superstores===
Asda superstores are large supermarkets with a non-food offer slightly smaller than an Asda Supercentre. As of 31 January 2021, there are 342 superstores. Most superstores have a petrol filling station and dining and refreshment facilities for shoppers such as customer cafes, and selected stores have [[McDonald's]] franchise restaurants or "Express Diners" The [[Old Kent Road]], [[Scunthorpe]] and [[Colindale]] stores are trialling a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] franchise.

===Asda Supermarket===
In May 2010, Asda announced the purchase of the 193 UK stores of Danish discount retailer Netto in a £778&nbsp;million deal. But the Competition Commission made them sell off 47 of the stores to other retailers. The remaining stores continued to trade as Netto stores until early 2011, when Asda integrated the stores into its supermarkets division, designated for shops smaller than {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10171193.stm|title=Asda to take over Netto stores in UK|work=BBC News |date=27 May 2010|access-date=27 May 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100530083918/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/10171193.stm| archive-date= 30 May 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> These former Netto stores form the core of the Asda Supermarket format.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://retailanalysis.igd.com/news/news-article/t/asda-trials-new-smaller-supermarket-format/i/7803|title=Asda trials new smaller supermarket format|date=16 December 2013|publisher=Retail Analysis|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> As of 31 January 2021, there are 207 supermarkets.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

===Asda Living===
[[File:Asda Living - Crown Point Retail Park - geograph.org.uk - 1145714.jpg|thumb|right|An ''Asda Living'' branch in Leeds.]]
In October 2003, Asda launched a new format called '''Asda Living'''. This is the company's first "general merchandise" store, containing all its non-food ranges including clothing, home electronics, toys, homewares, health, and beauty products. With these stores they have linked up with [[Compass Group]] who operate the coffee shop Living Cafe within some of the stores. The first store with this format opened in [[Walsall]], West Midlands. As at 31 January 2021, there are 33 stores.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

===George stores===
In 2004, the George clothing brand was extended to a number of standalone George stores on the high street; the first George standalone store to open was in Preston. In 2008, all George standalone stores were closed due to high rental costs resulting in low profitability.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/2785581/Asda-calls-it-a-day-for-George.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=James | last=Hall | title=Asda calls it a day for George | date=5 March 2008}}</ref>

In 2011, Asda announced its intention to establish a small number of pilot George stores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://your.asda.com/archives/press-centre/05/2011|title=News & Blogs|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref> In January 2012 Asda announced that it had agreed to terms with two franchise partners to open international George stores. Through the agreement with SandpiperCI, based in the Channel Islands, the company will be responsible for opening George franchises in both Jersey and Guernsey, and through the Azadea Group, headquartered in Beirut, Lebanon, the George franchise stores would open in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://your.asda.com/archives/press-centre/01/2012|title=News & Blogs|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

===Asda Essentials===
In April 2006, Asda launched a new trial format called 'Asda Essentials' in [[Northampton]], followed by another in [[Pontefract]] a month later.<ref name="essential">{{cite news|title=Asda's new stores prove not-so-Essential in the discount market|first=Julia|last=Finch|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=5 December 2006|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/dec/05/supermarkets.asda|access-date=9 October 2008 }}</ref> The stores were modelled on France's [[Leader Price]] chain, with a smaller floorplate than Asda's mainstream stores and with a primary focus on own-brand products, only stocking branded items that were perceived to be at the "core" of a family's weekly shop with the aim being to challenge the dominance of [[Tesco]] and Sainsbury's in the convenience store market while at the same time addressing competition from discount supermarkets such as [[Aldi]], [[Lidl]] and Netto.<ref name="essential" /> On 6 December 2006, ''The Guardian'' reported that further planned store openings were under review following poor sales in the existing outlets, while the range of branded products being carried was also being expanded due to customer demand.<ref name="essential" /> In January 2007 it was announced that the original Northampton trial store would close within a month after only 10 months of trading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.igd.com/analysis/news/index.asp?nid=3468 |title=Asda Essentials trial continues despite store closure |date=9 January 2007 |access-date=11 January 2007 |publisher=IGD Retail Analysis |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004343/http://www.igd.com/analysis/news/index.asp?nid=3468 |archive-date=13 July 2011 }}</ref>

===Asda Petrol===
In 2012, Asda trialled a new standalone petrol filling station format (which means that they are not attached to or near an existing Asda store) at two locations in Sale, Greater Manchester and Leeds Bridge, which is located opposite head office. They include a small convenience store and click and collect facilities. The trial was a success and in 2014, a full roll out of this format was announced after a third site opened in Northolt, West London. In February 2015, 15 petrol filling stations were acquired from Rontec Ltd, and converted to the new format. Asda originally aimed to have at least 100 standalone forecourts by 2018. However, in October 2015, the company decided to slow the roll out down to address the problems associated with a major collapse of profits from its large store formats due to intense competition from its main rivals. But, the company is still continuing to add a combination of fully automated credit/debit card payment only petrol stations and petrol stations with traditional forecourt shops within the car parks of its existing store portfolio and to new store sites.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

Asda was also the first supermarket chain in the United Kingdom to sell petrol at its old Halifax store in 1967, which at the time was located inside a converted mill in Battinson Road which burnt down during a major fire in 1982, and subsequently reopened as a purpose-built store in 1983, without the petrol station. The store moved to a different site in 2004. Back then its forecourt fuel was supplied by discount Russian supplier Nafta, because the major oil companies would not supply fuel to be sold at discount prices. From the early seventies, oil companies such as Mobil, Shell and Texaco supplied fuel to Asda as more supermarkets started to sell fuel from car park forecourts. Since the mid-1990s Asda has supplied, along with its main supermarket rivals, its own fuel delivered by its own tankers to its petrol station forecourts.  As of June 2018, Asda operates 319 petrol stations in total, 18 of which are standalone and the others mostly within the car park area of its stores.<ref name="Information for Walmart Investors: Unit Counts & Square Footage"/>

===George clothing===
Asda has its own range of clothing known as '''George''', which was created and trialled in selected stores in 1989, and officially launched and rolled out to the main superstore estate in 1990. It replaced the older Asdale/Asda clothing labels of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/design/article/554301/superbrand-case-studies-george/ |title=Superbrands case studies: George |publisher=Brand Republic |date=18 April 2006 |access-date=30 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130118134305/http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/design/article/554301/superbrand-case-studies-george/ |archive-date=18 January 2013 }}</ref> This is marketed as quality fashion clothing at affordable prices. Walmart also sells the George brand in Argentina, Canada, China, India, Japan, Mexico, and the US (and in South Korea until Walmart pulled out of that market). George clothing is also sold at four stand alone dedicated stores in Malta, the first opening in 2013. George is a participant in the Sustainable Clothing Action Plan (SCAP), the ambition of which is to improve the sustainability of clothing throughout its lifecycle by helping to reduce the impacts of carbon, water and waste across the fashion sector.<ref>{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Doing the Right Thing Our Responsible Retail Programme Third edition, June 2014|url=https://direct.asda.com/on/demandware.static/-/Library-Sites-ASDAShared/default/v4fd87320d2e43007be720db54c2a76656657b46d/sourcebygeorge/pdf/George_DTRT_Report_2014.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=21 January 2021|website=Asda}}</ref> The label is named after [[George Davies (retailer)|George Davies]], founder of [[Next (clothing)|Next]], who was its original chief designer.

In 2005, Asda stated that the George range was a £1.75&nbsp;billion business, including sales from Walmart stores in the United States and Germany. [[Mintel]] estimate that George is the fourth largest retailer of clothing in the United Kingdom, after [[Marks & Spencer]], the [[Arcadia Group]] and Next.<ref>[[Mintel]] Clothing Retailing – UK, July 2005</ref>

Relations have improved since, with both Asda and the GMB marking the death of a worker together on [[Workers' Memorial Day]] in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|title=GMB Members and Asda Bedford Mark International Workers' Memorial Day 2010 |url=http://www.gmb.org.uk/default.aspx?page=1027 |date=26 April 2010 |website=GMB |access-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710044416/http://www.gmb.org.uk/default.aspx?page=1027 |archive-date=10 July 2010 }}</ref>

In 2013, tens of thousands of Asda workers across the UK were hit with a tax complication because of an anomaly in Asda's payroll system. Asda employees receive their pay every four weeks, which meant, according to their spokesperson, that once every 20 years they are paid 14 times a year rather than 13. Whilst most companies handle this properly, Asda's payroll system did not, which meant that workers had, through no fault of their own, paid less tax for the year than they should have. This resulted in most full-time and a small number of part-time workers receiving a demand from [[HM Revenue & Customs]] for between £72 and £160.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tax shock for thousands of Asda workers|url=http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk/exclusive-tax-shock-for-thousands-of-asda-workers-1.113215|publisher=thecourier|access-date=1 October 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925132343/http://www.thecourier.co.uk/news/uk/exclusive-tax-shock-for-thousands-of-asda-workers-1.113215|archive-date=25 September 2013}}</ref>

In 2016 Asda became involved in a protracted equal pay dispute with its lower-paid shop staff, supported by GMB. 44,000 employees argued that mostly female shop staff could compare their pay with higher paid mostly male warehouse workers, under the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]] and [[Equality Act 2010]]. In March 2021 the employees won a [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]] ruling upholding an earlier court ruling permitting the action, and enabling [[employment tribunal]] action to decide "equal value" claims. Asda stated "This ruling relates to one stage of a complex case that is likely to take several years to reach a conclusion."<ref name=bbc-20210326>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56534988 |title=Asda loses Supreme Court appeal in equal pay fight |work=BBC News |date=26 March 2021 |access-date=26 March 2021}}</ref> The claim could lead to about £500 million of compensation to lower paid employees.<ref name=guardian-20210326>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2021/mar/26/court-rules-against-asda-in-workers-equal-pay-case |title=Court rules against Asda in workers. equal pay case |last=Butler |first=Sarah |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 March 2021 |access-date=26 March 2021}}</ref>

===Campaigns===
In the 'Asda price' campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename=TA2532&advertiser=ASDA|title = Asda 'Thank You' TV ad – 30 sec advert|publisher=www.tellyads.com|access-date =9 October 2008}}</ref> customers tap their trouser pocket twice, producing a 'chinking' sound as the coins that Asda's low prices have supposedly left in their pockets knock together. The pocket tap ads were launched in 1977 and over the next 30 years, a range of celebrities have been "tappers", including from 1978, actors [[Richard Beckinsale]], [[Paula Wilcox]] and [[James Bolam]]. And later, [[Julie Walters]], and football player [[Michael Owen]]. In the late 1970s, adverts also included actor [[Leonard Rossiter]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/mar/18/asda-pocket-tap-adverts|title=Asda brings back 'pocket tap' ads |work=The Guardian |location=London |access-date=15 July 2009| first=Mark| last=Sweney| date=18 March 2009| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090801194231/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/18/asda-pocket-tap-adverts| archive-date= 1 August 2009 | url-status= live}}
</ref>

In 1980, ''Carry On'' actress [[Hattie Jacques]] appeared in the advert as a [[Crossing guard|school crossing patrol officer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uktvadverts.com/Home/Search.aspx?advert=5523 |title="Info for Superstores – Asda" at Vuktvadverts.com |publisher=Uktvadverts.com |access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref> Between 1981 and 1985, Asda used the slogan 'All Together Better' in conjunction with the 'Asda Price' pocket tap campaign in TV commercials and newspaper and magazine advertisements. When the new green capitalised ASDA logo started to appear from 1985, in early 1986 onwards and until early 1989, two slogans were used. The first, 'You'd be off your trolley to go anywhere else', was replaced in 1987 by 'One trip and you're laughing'.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oj1OAL8zvco|title=One trip and you're laughing|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

In 1989, and until late 1991, before the reintroduction of the pocket tap campaign, advertising for Asda had featured the [[Fairground Attraction]] song "[[Perfect (Fairground Attraction song)|Perfect]]" with the slogan 'It 'Asda be Asda', which was based upon the lyrics of the song. When the Asda Price slogan was reintroduced in 1992, the strapline Pocket the Difference (capitalised) was added alongside it. This was replaced by Permanently Low Prices, Forever in 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/supermarket-set-boulder-go--3152424|title=Supermarket set to boulder go...|publisher=Coventry Live|date=28 January 2004|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

From 1990 to 1991, Asda were the sponsors of [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://swfchistory.wikifoundry.com/page/Shirt+Sponsors|title=Sponsors|publisher=Sheffield Wednesday|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref>

In the smiley face "rollback" campaign, also used by Walmart, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] smiley face bounced from price tag to price tag, knocking them down as customers watch.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2015/01/06/asda-ploughs-300m-latest-rollback-campaign|title=Asda ploughs £300m into latest rollback campaign|date=6 January 2015|publisher=The Drum|access-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> In 2006, Asda advertising was themed around singing children and the slogan "More for you for less".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.campaignlive.co.uk/article/asda-drop-slogan-boost-marketing-45m-image-revamp/544756|title=Asda to drop slogan and boost marketing to £45m in image revamp|date=6 March 2006|newspaper=Campaign Live|access-date=3 April 2021}}</ref>

For Christmas 2007, Asda reintroduced the "That's Asda price" slogan.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.tellyads.com/show_movie.php?filename=TA5261&advertiser=Asda|title = Asda 'Something Big' TV ad – 20 sec advert|publisher=www.tellyads.com|access-date =9 October 2008}}</ref>

In 2008, the company refocused on price with a "Why Pay More?" campaign both on TV and in stores. Asda TV commercials in April 2009 focused on price comparisons between Asda and its rivals, using information from [[mySupermarket]]. The music being used in these adverts is the [[Billy Childish]] version of the classic ''[[Dad's Army]]'' theme tune. The old Asda jingle is not included in these,<ref>

In August 2005, rival supermarket chain Tesco challenged Asda's ability to use the claim that it was the cheapest supermarket in the country, by complaining to the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Agency]]. The ASA upheld the complaint and ordered Asda to stop using it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4158368.stm |title=Asda made to drop low price claim|publisher=BBC|work=BBC News|date= 17 August 2005|access-date=29 September 2015}}</ref>

===Energy Drinks===
In January 2018, Asda became one of the first supermarkets to ban selling energy drinks such as [[Red Bull]] to under-16s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://inews.co.uk/news/uk/asda-aldi-ban-sales-red-bull-16s/|title=Asda and Aldi to ban sale of Red Bull and other energy drinks to under-16s|date=18 January 2018}}</ref>

===Ethical trading===
Asda has signed up to the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) which respects workers' rights for freedom of association and a living wage. Implementing this initiative is difficult, however, because the concept of a living wage varies by country and the buying strategies of a major importer like Asda have an indirect impact on national minimum wages by obliging governments to set them low enough to stop businesses from going elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cleanupfashion.co.uk/companies/asda.php |title = Clean Up Fashion; Asda Walmart |access-date = 23 November 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061220070605/http://www.cleanupfashion.co.uk/companies/asda.php |archive-date = 20 December 2006 |url-status = dead }}</ref> Industry pressure groups such as [[Labour Behind the Label]] and [[War on Want]] have argued that Asda and other budget retailers use unethical labour practices in the developing world to keep UK prices low.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion Victims|url=http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/13593-fashion-victims|date=15 December 2006|website=War on Want|access-date=18 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314033909/http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/13593-fashion-victims|archive-date=14 March 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fashion Victims II |url=http://www.waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/16360-fashion-victims-ii |date=1 December 2008 |website=War on Want |access-date=18 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302054854/http://waronwant.org/campaigns/supermarkets/fashion-victims/inform/16360-fashion-victims-ii |archive-date=2 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers' Union]], representing UK farmers and growers, has argued that Asda and other major supermarkets have made large profits and kept consumer prices low "by squeezing suppliers' margins to the point where many of them have gone out of business".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfuonline.com/x16312.xml |title=Dismay at commitment to cheap food by ASDA |access-date=30 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314022517/http://www.nfuonline.com/x16312.xml |archive-date=14 March 2012 }}</ref> Asda have also refused to sign up to and donate to the Rana Plaza Donors Trust Fund, to donate compensation to the families of workers in Bangladesh killed when their factory building in Rana Plaza collapsed in 2013. Instead, Asda donated an undisclosed sum to the poverty relief charity ''Building Relationships Across Communities'', who in turn pledged around £1.3m to the fund. Campaigners believe Asda is unwilling to set a precedent on indemnity pay for large scale industrial accidents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/a-6a90-Rana-Plaza-One-year-on,-no-justice|title= One year on, no justice|work=Morningstar Online|access-date=23 October 2014}}</ref>

In 2009, Asda's [[Valentine's Day]] roses, sold at £2 for a dozen, were said to be ethically sourced by the supermarket. This claim went against research carried out by [[War on Want]].<ref>{{cite web|title=£2 Valentine flowers poverty alert|url=http://www.waronwant.org/news/press-releases/16464-p2-valentine-flowers-poverty-alert|date=13 February 2009|website=War on Want|access-date=18 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216084007/http://waronwant.org/news/press-releases/16464-p2-valentine-flowers-poverty-alert|archive-date=16 February 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Controversies==

===Dairy price fixing===
In December 2007, Asda, Sainsbury's and other retailers and dairy firms admitted to the [[price fixing]] of [[dairy product]]s between 2002 and 2003.<ref name="milk">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7132108.stm |title=Supermarkets admit milk price fix |work=BBC News |date=7 December 2007 |access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref> The price
operation was calculated to have cost consumers around £270&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dairy Price Fixing Firms Fined Millions|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Business/Asda-and-Sainsburys-Fined-Over-Dairy-Price-Fixing/Article/20071211296071?lid=ARTICLE_1296071_Asda%20and%20Sainsbury's%20Fined%20Over%20Dairy%20Price%20Fixing&lpos=Business_0
|date=7 December 2007|website=Sky News|access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref>

Asda commented, "''Everyone at Asda regrets what happened, particularly as we are passionate about lowering prices. Our intention was to provide more money for dairy farmers, who were under severe financial pressure at the time.''"<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson |first=James |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7132108.stm |title=Supermarkets admit milk price fix |publisher=BBC |date=7 December 2007 |access-date=8 October 2014}}</ref> In total, Asda was fined £18.21&nbsp;million by the Office of Fair Trading for its part in the [[cartel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2011/89-11#.UiYwetJciCc |title=OFT fines certain supermarkets and processors almost £50&nbsp;million in dairy decision - The Office of Fair Trading |publisher=Oft.gov.uk |date=10 August 2011 |access-date=3 September 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130819154929/http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2011/89-11 |archive-date=19 August 2013 }}</ref>

===False and misleading advertising===
In 2010, a national press ad for Asda on a double-page spread was headed "The big Asda Rollback" with headings stating "Lower prices on everything you buy, week in week out" with equal prominence to a column headed "Lower prices than any other supermarket"; that the arrows underneath the heading "Lower prices than any other supermarket" compared prices at Asda with prices at Sainsbury's, Tesco and Morrisons. The ASA ruled that in the context in which it appeared, it was ambiguous in that it could be interpreted either as referring to price reductions that had taken place within Asda or to price comparisons with the named competitors. In addition, because the ad did not explain that the price reductions had not necessarily taken place in the week that immediately preceded the ad, they concluded that the headings which stated the number of price reductions that had taken place in each product category were misleading. The ASA also concluded that the "Lower prices than any other supermarket" claim in the advert was misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2010/9/Asda-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_49062.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA disagreed, and referred to the claim "Everything is at least half price!" was likely to imply to viewers that all toys were included in the sale. As all toys were not included in the sale, and in the absence of a qualifying statement, the ad was misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/1/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_49580.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA ruled that a television advertisement in 2011 for the new Asda price guarantee was misleading in that the small on-screen text that stated "Exclusions apply" was not sufficient to warn viewers that the Asda price guarantee did not apply to non-grocery items.<ref name="asa.org.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2011/2/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_49664.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA also ruled against two national press ads one which showed hardback and children's books and one that showed football related items with text stating "If your grocery shopping could have cost less elsewhere we'll give you the difference - Guaranteed!". Although each advert had "Exclusions apply" and that other text stated "If your grocery shopping could have cost less elsewhere we'll give you the difference", it felt that given the prominent appearance of the hardback and children's activity books and football related items and the prominent appearance of the logo "ASDA Price GUARANTEE" and "Guaranteed!", they considered the footnote and other text referred to above was not sufficient to warn readers that non-grocery items particularly those included in the advertisement were not included in the Asda price guarantee.<ref name="asa.org.uk"/>

Another advertisement from Asda, in which it featured World Cup related products and an Asda price guarantee was misleading as the World Cup related products were exclusive to Asda and not, therefore, available at Morrisons, Tesco or Sainsbury's.<ref name="asa.org.uk"/>

In 2009, the ASA challenged whether a press ad which showed a large green arrow bearing down on a smaller yellow arrow with a crumpled tip and "Asda 2955 products cheaper" should set out how the general price claims made in the ads could be verified by consumers. Because it was not possible for consumers or competitors to check the products and prices used in the comparison using mySupermarket.co.uk, and because the ads did not set out how consumers and competitors could check that information for themselves, the ASA concluded that the ads did not satisfy the criterion of verifiability as defined in the 2006 European Court of Justice ruling, and were therefore in breach of the advertising Codes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/1/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_45639.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

The ASA ruled that, due to the significant limitations and qualifications to the basis of the price comparison which were not included in the ad, or in the terms and conditions on Asda's website, the approach taken in making the comparisons was unfair and misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/9/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_176272.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

A press ad, which appeared on 26 September 2011, was headlined "Only one supermarket is ... always 10% cheaper or we'll give you the difference guaranteed". However, at the top of the ad there was a banner that contained the claims "SALE", "Half Price", "Price Drop", "50% off", "1/2 price", "cheap" and that part of the headline claim "... always 10% cheaper" appeared in bold text in the middle of the ad. The ASA considered the banner, together with the headline was likely to be interpreted by consumers as claims that referred to the price of Asda goods. Since consumers could interpret that claim as one which guaranteed to refund the difference, should Asda not be the lowest on price, the ASA considered the presence of the claim "only one supermarket is always 10% cheaper" could create the impression that Asda were always 10% cheaper and would be interpreted as a 'lowest price' claim. The ASA therefore concluded that the advert was misleading. It also noted the footnote explaining the APG contradicted Asda's absolute claim that they were always the lowest on price, and that the disclaimer was also misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2012/3/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_175453.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>

In 2009, a four-page regional press wraparound included several maps and images of a proposed development in [[New Barnet]], and described the benefits the development would bring to the local area. The advert included a development site plan and map, which marked out the proposed Asda store, the existing Sainsbury store and the sites of the proposed, approved and existing Tesco stores. Because it was not clear that the marked-out area relating to the Asda store was for only the store floorspace, whereas the marked-out area relating to the Sainsburys store included store floorspace and additional buildings, and the marked-out area relating to the proposed Tesco area was not based on an approved plan, the ASA concluded the advertisement was misleading.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2009/11/ASDA-Stores-Ltd/TF_ADJ_47195.aspx|title=ASA Ruling on ASDA Stores Ltd|access-date=25 July 2015}}</ref>
