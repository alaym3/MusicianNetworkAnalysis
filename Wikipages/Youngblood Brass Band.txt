The '''Youngblood Brass Band''' is an American [[brass band]] from [[Madison, Wisconsin]] that was established in 1998. The band has released six albums and has toured throughout the United States and Europe.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = Youngblood Brass Band|url = http://www.youngbloodbrassband.com/#members|website =Youngbloodbrassband.com|access-date = 2015-12-05}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=April 2021}}

==History==
The band came together in 1995 as the One Lard Biskit Brass Band, subsequently releasing the album ''Better Recognize'' locally. The Youngblood name dates from 1998, the year the group put out their first album, ''Word On The Street''. In 2000 Youngblood released ''Unlearn'', which featured appearances by [[Talib Kweli]], [[Mike Ladd]], [[DJ Skooly]] and [[Ike Willis]]. ''Unlearn'', which like ''Word On The Street'' was released independently, garnered the band significant attention and led to them being signed to [[Ozone Music NYC]]. The band's first album for Ozone, called ''center:level:roar'', came out in 2003.

In 2004, sousaphonist and primary arranger Nat McIntosh left the group. As McIntosh’s music was a "main component of the band's sound since inception",<ref>from ''Live. Places.'' liner notes</ref> his departure marked a change in sound for Youngblood Brass Band, as chronicled by the release of ''[[Live. Places. (album)|Live. Places]]'' and ''[[Is That a Riot?]]''. The band's work during this time features a harder hip-hop edge with stronger punk influences compared to their other work.

In 2005 they released a live album entitled ''live. places.'' on their [[Layered Music]] record label. ''Is That a Riot?'' (2006) was supported by multiple international tours and festival appearances. 

McIntosh rejoined the band in 2013, and his playing and songwriting both appear on ''[[Pax Volumi]]'', which was released on September 9, 2013 by Tru Thoughts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Youngblood Brass Band Sign to Tru Thoughts|url=http://www.tru-thoughts.co.uk/news/youngblood-brass-band-sign-to-tru-thoughts|website=Tru-thoughts.co.uk|access-date=26 May 2013}}</ref> They released ''[[20 Years Young]]'', a compilation spanning the band's two-decade existence, in 2017, and followed it in 2018 with the most recent ''[[Covers 1]]'' EP, both released independently.

In 2021, Joseph Goltz announced on behalf of the band that they would be cutting ties with founding member David Henzie-Skogen after numerous sexual misconduct allegations, and that they would no longer be a part of his Layered Arts Collective. <ref name="Tone Madison 2021">{{cite web | title=Madison musicians begin to break publicly with drummer accused of sexual misconduct | website=Tone Madison | date=2021-10-13 | url=https://www.tonemadison.com/articles/madison-musicians-begin-to-break-publicly-with-drummer-accused-of-sexual-misconduct | access-date=2021-11-02}}</ref>

==Educational work==
Band members credit "really good public school system arts-education programs"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1957271|title=The Youngblood Brass Band|website=Npr.org|access-date=1 October 2020}}</ref> for inspiring their love of music, and they make an effort to play for schools as well as at clubs and larger venues. Under the aegis of the [[Layered Arts Collective]], which band members co-founded, they also presented musical lectures where in addition to performing, they discussed the history of brass bands and hip-hop. Layered Arts Collective also functioned as a record label/publishing house for their family of artists (including [[Cougar (band)|Cougar]], a group of [[experimental rock]]ers that also counted David Henzie-Skogen as a member). Youngblood has also released sheet music transcriptions of all songs included on their albums, since many university and high school music ensembles have begun including YBB in their repertoire.
