The '''Yeah Yeah Yeahs''' are<!--- "Are" is correct; see [[Talk:The Beach Boys#Singular or Plural]] ---> an American [[indie rock]] band formed in New York City in 2000. The group is composed of vocalist and pianist [[Karen O]] (born Karen Lee Orzolek), guitarist and keyboardist [[Nick Zinner]], and drummer [[Brian Chase]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Phares |first=Heather |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/yeah-yeah-yeahs-p522831/biography |title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs |publisher=AllMusic |date=May 17, 2002 |access-date=2011-10-09}}</ref> They are complemented in live performances by second guitarist [[David Pajo]] (formerly of [[Slint (band)|Slint]] and [[Tortoise (band)|Tortoise]]), who joined as a touring member in 2009 and replaced [[Imaad Wasif]], who had previously held the role. According to an interview that aired during ABC's ''Live from [[Central Park SummerStage]]'' series, the band's name was taken from modern New York City [[vernacular]].<ref>{{Citation|title = Yeah Yeah Yeahs - Live from Central Park, 2004|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOEBDxllJu4|date = 2012-12-21|access-date = 2016-02-08|last = Nuno Brandão}}</ref>

The band has recorded four studio albums; the first, ''[[Fever to Tell]]'', was released in 2003. The second, ''[[Show Your Bones]]'', was released in 2006 and was named the second best album of the year by ''[[NME]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title = A decade in music - 50 best albums of 2006 {{!}} NME.COM|url = https://www.nme.com/photos/a-decade-in-music-50-best-albums-of-2006/161055#/photo/47|website = NME|access-date = 2016-02-08|language = en-GB|last = NME.COM}}</ref> Their third studio album, ''[[It's Blitz!]]'', was released in March 2009. All three albums earned the band Grammy nominations for Best Alternative Music Album. Their fourth album, ''[[Mosquito (Yeah Yeah Yeahs album)|Mosquito]]'', was released in April 2013.

==History==
===Formation and ''Fever to Tell'' (1990s–2004)===
[[Karen O]] and [[Brian Chase]] first met as students at [[Oberlin College]] in Ohio in the late 1990s, where Chase was a jazz student at the conservatory. Karen then transferred to [[New York University]] and met [[Nick Zinner|Zinner]] in a local bar, where they formed an "instant connection." During this time, they also shared a loft with future members of the band [[Metric (band)|Metric]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ladygunn.com/music/emily-haines-of-metric-interview |title=YYYs shared a loft with Metric |publisher=Ladygunn.com |access-date=2011-10-09}}</ref> Orzolek and Zinner formed an acoustic duo called Unitard but soon decided to "shake things up a bit" by forming a "trashy, punky, grimy" band modeled after the art student, [[avant-punk]] bands Karen O was exposed to at Oberlin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/26/popandrock.yeahyeahyeahs|title=Lynsey Hansley talks to Yeah Yeah Yeahs| first=Lynsey| last=Hanley| date=February 26, 2006|work=The Guardian| access-date=2009-04-15}}</ref> After the drummer they initially recruited bowed out, Chase joined the line-up.

The band wrote a slew of songs at their first rehearsal and soon wound up supporting [[The Strokes]] and [[The White Stripes]], earning a significant buzz for their arty and garage punk scene. In late 2001, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs released their [[Yeah Yeah Yeahs (EP)|self-titled debut EP]], which they recorded with [[Boss Hog]]'s Jerry Teel, on their own Shifty label.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Jerry+Teel| title=Jerry Teel| work=[[Discogs]]|access-date=2009-04-15}}</ref> Early the next year, they stepped into the international spotlight, appearing at [[South by Southwest]], touring the U.S. with [[Girls Against Boys]], and Europe with [[Jon Spencer Blues Explosion]], and headlining their own U.K. tour. [[Wichita Recordings]] distributed the group's EP in the U.K. and [[Touch and Go Records|Touch and Go]] reissued it in the States.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/yeah_yeah_yeahs/artist.jhtml| title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs|publisher=mtv| access-date=2009-04-15}}</ref>

In 2003, the band released their debut album, ''[[Fever to Tell]]'', which received several strong critical reviews and sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide. The album's third single, "[[Maps (Yeah Yeah Yeahs song)|Maps]]", received significant airplay on [[alternative rock|alternative]] radio. In 2010, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked "Maps" as 386th in their list of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time|500 Greatest Songs of All Time]]. The video for their 2004 single "[[Y Control]]" was directed by [[Spike Jonze]]. In October 2004, the band released their first DVD, ''[[Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow]]''. The DVD included a concert filmed at [[The Fillmore]] in San Francisco, all of the band's music videos to date, and various interviews. Later the same year, they were featured in [[Scott Crary]]'s documentary ''[[Kill Your Idols (film)|Kill Your Idols]]''.

In November 2009, ''[[NME]]'' rated ''Fever to Tell'' the No. 5 Best Album of the Decade.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nme.com/news/the-strokes/48412 |title=The Strokes' 'Is This It' tops NME albums of the decade list  |access-date=2009-11-17  |date=November 17, 2009 |work=NME News }}</ref>

===''Show Your Bones'' and ''Is Is'' EP (2005–2007)===
[[File:Karen O, Tim Festival.jpg|thumb|left|150px|upright|Karen O live at the Tim Festival in 2006]]
The Yeah Yeah Yeahs' second album, ''[[Show Your Bones]]'', was released on 27–28 March 2006. [[Karen O]] told [[online zine]] [[Drowned in Sound]], "''[[Show Your Bones]]'' is what happens when you put your finger in a light socket", crediting "9-year old antigenius wonder-kid Drake Barrett for the insight."<ref>{{cite news|first=Colin |last=Roberts |url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/562122 |title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs LP and single details, yeah |work=[[Drowned In Sound]] |date=January 11, 2006 |access-date=2008-11-19}}</ref> The first single from the album, "[[Gold Lion]]", was released on 20 March 2006, reaching number 18 in the [[Official UK Singles Chart]]. It has been noted by Leah Greenblatt that "[[Gold Lion]]" sounds startlingly similar to "No New Tale To Tell" from 1980s alternative band [[Love and Rockets (band)|Love and Rockets]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenblatt |first=Leah |url=https://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1204700,00.html |title=Did The Red Hot Chili Peppers copy Tom Petty? |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=June 16, 2006 |issue=883 |access-date=2008-11-19}}</ref>

The band toured throughout Europe and the United States during much of 2006, and also helped to curate an edition of the British [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival.

In December 2006, the album was named second best album of the year by ''[[NME]]'' magazine, and "Cheated Hearts" was voted 10th best song. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine named ''Show Your Bones'' the 44th best album of 2006, while ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' magazine ranked it number 31 on their 40 best albums of 2006.

Yeah Yeah Yeahs' third EP, titled ''[[Is Is]]'', was released on 24 July 2007. It includes 5 previously unreleased songs and a short film, which was recorded and filmed at the [[Glasslands Gallery]] in Brooklyn, NY. The songs were written in 2004, during the Fever To Tell tour, and performed live often.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43606-yeah-yeah-yeahs-to-release-new-ep-of-old-songs |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307024159/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/news/43606-yeah-yeah-yeahs-to-release-new-ep-of-old-songs |archive-date=March 7, 2008 |title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs to Release New EP of Old Songs |last=Maher |first=Dave |date=July 13, 2006 |work=Pitchfork |access-date=2009-09-17 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Three of the five tracks were featured on the ''[[Tell Me What Rockers to Swallow]]'' DVD.

In a press release, the band announced, "A friend of a friend kept asking if we were ever gonna put ''Fever to Tell'' out on vinyl as it hasn't been on vinyl in 10 years. That's not right. So here it is on vinyl for the first time in 10 years plus a time capsule of photos, demos (1st ever recorded,) a mini film documenting our near downfall and other fun memorabilia, from the turn of the century NYC, made with love + the usual blood, sweat + tears of Yeah Yeah Yeahs."

To celebrate the reissue, the band performed a small series of shows in October and November at [[The Fonda Theatre]] in Los Angeles, California, the [[Fox Oakland Theatre]] in Oakland, California, and [[Kings Theatre (Brooklyn)|Kings Theatre]] in Brooklyn, New York.

==Musical style==
The Yeah Yeahs' style has been described as "an art-rock trio who made an edgy post-punk, dancefloor-friendly racket that mixed up [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] with [[Siouxsie and the Banshees]]".<ref name="timesonline2009"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Gross |first=Joe |url=https://www.spin.com/2013/04/yeah-yeah-yeahs-mosquito-interscope/ |title=Yeah Yeah Yeahs, 'Mosquito' (Interscope) |work=Spin |date=April 15, 2013 |access-date=November 8, 2015}}</ref>
