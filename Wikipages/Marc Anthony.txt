==Early life==
Marco Antonio Muñiz was born in New York City, the son of Puerto Rican parents. His father, Felipe, was a hospital cafeteria worker and musician, and his mother, Guillermina, was a housewife.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pitbull - Mr. Worldwide |last=Duthel |first=Chalee |date=2012 | page=218}}</ref><ref name="FNCP">{{Cite web|url=https://prpop.org/2017/01/al-bolero-el-papa-de-marc-anthony/|title=Al bolero el Papá de Marc Anthony|publisher=[[National Foundation for Popular Culture]]|location=San Juan, Puerto Rico|language=es}}</ref>

Anthony's parents named him after Mexican singer [[Marco Antonio Muñiz]]. Anthony grew up in East Harlem, also known as [[Spanish Harlem]] or El Barrio, and is the youngest of eight children. He was raised [[Roman Catholic]].<ref>{{cite web|last=George Rush, Joanna Molloy |first=Celeste Katz |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/06/06/2004-06-06_j_lo_weds_hubby__3___marries.html |title=J.Lo weds hubby No. 3 Marries Marc Anthony at her swank L.A. digs |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |quote=Both are of Puerto Rican descent and share the Catholic faith. |date=June 6, 2004 |access-date=September 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111013060522/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/06/06/2004-06-06_j_lo_weds_hubby__3___marries.html |archive-date=October 13, 2011 }}</ref>

His musical education began at home, where he learned to sing in both Spanish and English under the guidance of his father, Felipe, himself a professional guitarist.<!-- <ref name="Oboler. 2005"/> --> As a child, Anthony listened to a variety of musical genres and performers, including [[Rock music|rock]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[Pop music|pop]] stars [[José Feliciano]] (Puerto Rico), [[Air Supply]] (Australia), as well as [[salsa music|salsa]] legends [[Héctor Lavoe]] (Puerto Rico), [[Willie Colón]] (Puerto Rico), and [[Rubén Blades]] (Panama), among others.<!-- <ref name="Oboler. 2005"/> --> According to Anthony, renowned Puerto Rican percussionist and bandleader [[Tito Puente]] in particular wielded a profound personal and professional influence throughout his life.<ref name="Oboler. 2005">{{Cite book|title=The Oxford encyclopedia of Latinos & Latinas in the United States|last=Oboler.|first=Suzanne|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=González, Deena J.|isbn=019518842X|location=Oxford, UK|oclc=62270754}}</ref>

==Singing career==
Muñiz began his career as a session vocalist for [[freestyle music]] and underground New York [[house music]] acts. After changing his name to avoid confusion with his namesake,<ref name="Oboler. 2005"/> Anthony worked as a songwriter and backing vocalist for pop acts [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]] and the [[Latin Rascals]]. By the early 1990s, Anthony had sold more salsa records than any other performer on the planet, solidifying his position among the most important new salsa artists to emerge in the 1990s.<ref name="Oboler. 2005"/> Unlike the more socially conscious New York salsa musicians of the 1960s and 1970s, or the highly produced "romantic" salsa artists of the 1980s, Anthony gained fame performing a salsa style that borrowed more heavily from the African American and urban genres that he listened to growing up, such as rhythm and blues and house.<ref name="Oboler. 2005"/>

His first album was a freestyle music record, "Rebel," which debuted in 1988 on Bluedog Records.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|title=Marc Anthony|url=https://www.biography.com/musician/marc-anthony|access-date=2021-09-16|website=Biography|language=en-us}}</ref> That same year he wrote and produced "Boy I've Been Told" for fellow freestyle artist [[Sa-Fire]]. Then in 1989, he sang backup vocals for Ann-Marie on the freestyle club hit, "With or Without You" produced by [[Little Louie Vega]] and [[Todd Terry]]. A year later in 1990, with Little Louie Vega and Todd Terry, Marc wrote a duet with Chrissy I-eece, called "You Should Know By Now." In 1992, still working with [[Todd Terry]], he provided vocals for "Love Change," which is on the flip-side of a 12" vinyl released by Elan and The Powermachine titled "Here's Your Hat," production of Todd Terry. At the same time, he collaborated with music producer [[Little Louie Vega]], who featured the singer on many freestyle-flavored club hits "[[Ride On The Rhythm]]" and the "When The Night Is Over" album, which featured the freestyle classic "Time." In 1992, Vega and Anthony opened for Latin bandleader [[Tito Puente]] at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. After 1992, he changed his style from freestyle to salsa and other Latin styles.

===RMM Records===
Anthony was initially reluctant to become a salsa musician and declined an offer to make a salsa album when [[Ralph Mercado]], president of [[RMM Records & Video|RMM Records]], asked him. Anthony was in a taxi when he heard [[Juan Gabriel]]'s hit song, "[[Hasta Que Te Conocí]]," which influenced him to change his mind and ask Mercado if he could record it as a salsa tune.<ref>[https://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-01/entertainment/ca-64824_1_marc-anthony "Marc Anthony's Putting a Real Kick In His Salsa"], [[Los Angeles Times]], May 1, 1996.</ref> Inspired by the music of [[Tito Puente]], [[Héctor Lavoe]], [[Rubén Blades]], and [[Juan Gabriel]], Anthony released his Spanish-language debut, [[Otra Nota]], in 1993. Anthony performed at the [[Radio y Musica Convention]] hosted by [[Alfredo Alonso]].<ref>[http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Marc-Anthony-Biography/AC2D2D4FD50CF51B4825689000141599 Marc Anthony Biography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222208/http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Marc-Anthony-Biography/AC2D2D4FD50CF51B4825689000141599 |date=March 3, 2016 }}. Sing365.com. Retrieved October 1, 2011.</ref> The album also included a cover of [[Bread (band)|Bread]]'s song, "[[Make It with You]]." Subsequent tours throughout the Americas, including an opening slot for Blades, established Anthony as one of the new stars in salsa. In 1994, he was featured in [[La India]]'s album ''Dicen Que Soy'', on the song "Vivir Lo Nuestro".

His 1995 follow-up, ''Todo a su tiempo'', won Anthony a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' award for Hot Tropical Artist of the Year. The album was also nominated for a [[Grammy]] with songs like "Te Conozco Bien," "Hasta Ayer," "Nadie Como Ella," "Se Me Sigue Olvidando," "Te Amare," and "Llegaste A Mi." The album has sold more than 800,000 copies and has become established as a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]] in the United States and in Puerto Rico.

Anthony's next Spanish language album, ''Contra La Coriente'', was followed by the television special ''Marc Anthony: The Concert from [[Madison Square Garden]].'' It was broadcast on [[HBO]] on [[Valentine's Day]] in 2000. The special was nominated for the Music Special of the Year by ''[[TV Guide]]''. The album's song "[[Y Hubo Alguien]]" became Anthony's first number-one single on the [[Billboard Hot Latin Tracks|''Billboard'' Hot Latin Tracks]] and the first by a salsa musician.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Lannert|first=John|title=RMM's Anthony Builds Base for Int'l Career|date=December 20, 1997|work=Billboard}}</ref> The album became the first salsa album to enter the English language [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} After an ongoing battle with RMM, he severed ties with Ralph Mercado and left the label in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

''Otra Nota'', ''Todo a Su Tiempo'', and ''Contra La Corriente'' established him as the top-selling singer in the history of the genre, able to sell out Madison Square Garden and prestigious venues internationally.

===Sony Records===

Anthony subsequently recorded the duet "[[No Me Ames]]" with [[Jennifer Lopez]] on her album ''[[On the 6]]'', giving her an assist in her Spanish language crossover attempt. He also recorded a duet "[[I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You]]" with [[Tina Arena]], written by [[James Horner]] for the latter's soundtrack for the 1998 [[swashbuckling]] movie ''[[The Mask of Zorro]]''.

In 1999, riding the crossover wave of [[Ricky Martin]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]] in the Anglophone market, Anthony, working with producers [[Walter Afanasieff]], [[Cory Rooney]], [[Dan Shea (Record Producer)|Dan Shea]], and [[Rodney Jerkins]], released an English-language, [[Marc Anthony (album)|self-titled]] album with the US Top 5 single "[[I Need to Know (Marc Anthony song)|I Need to Know]]", and the Spanish version, "Dímelo". His song "[[You Sang to Me|You Sang To Me]]" was featured in ''[[Runaway Bride (1999 film)|Runaway Bride]]''. A dance version was remixed by Dutch producer Rene Van Verseveld. The album debuted at number eight on the ''Billboard'' album chart, and six weeks later went platinum; it eventually was certified triple platinum. The song "I Need To Know" earned a Grammy nomination for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

In June 2004, Anthony released a Latin pop album, ''[[Amar Sin Mentiras]]''. The following month, he reintroduced its songs with a danceable salsa rhythm in another album, ''Valio La Pena''.

Anthony performed "The Star-Spangled Banner" at the 2013 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. While Anthony is an American of Puerto Rican descent, a controversy sprang up on social media due to some viewers' mistaken impression that he is a Mexican. In an interview, Anthony responded, "'Let's get this straight. I was born and raised in New York. You can't get more New York than me'".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/marc-anthony-addresses-all-star-game-viewers-complaints-that-hes-not-american|title=Marc Anthony Addresses All-Star Game Viewers Complaints That He's Not American|first=Kacy|last=Ray|date=December 19, 2016|website=Fox News}}</ref>

Anthony married former [[Miss Universe]] [[Dayanara Torres]] on May 9, 2000, in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]].

There were many problems in the marriage, and the couple separated in early 2002. They later reconciled and renewed their vows in a formal ceremony on December 7, 2002, at San Juan's Cathedral in [[Puerto Rico]]. The rocky marriage came to an end in October 2003 with Dayanara filing for divorce in January 2004. To help her recover from the divorce, Dayanara traded her engagement ring for a diamond-encrusted [[Cartier SA|Cartier]] watch and wrote the book ''Married to Me: How Committing to Myself Led to Triumph After Divorce''.
