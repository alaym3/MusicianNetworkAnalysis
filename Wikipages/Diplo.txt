===Early life===

The influence of home-grown rap played a key role in helping shape Diplo's production style. Although he was born in Mississippi, he spent the majority of his youth in Miami, where he got a taste for the characteristic [[Miami bass]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/diplo-talks-miami-bass-strip-clubs-and-more-w-nardwuar-new-video.24513.html|title=Diplo Talks Miami, Bass, Strip Clubs & More w/ Nardwuar|work=HotNewHipHop|date=8 January 2014|access-date=November 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030125350/http://www.hotnewhiphop.com/diplo-talks-miami-bass-strip-clubs-and-more-w-nardwuar-new-video.24513.html|archive-date=October 30, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rbmaradio.com/people/diplo |title=Diplo |work=Red Bull Music Academy Radio |access-date=November 8, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715114153/http://www.rbmaradio.com/people/diplo |archive-date=July 15, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/diplo/id4527097|title=iTunes – Music – Diplo|website=Itunes.apple.com|access-date=November 8, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930134607/https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/diplo/id4527097|archive-date=September 30, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> He began attending the [[University of Central Florida]] in 1997.

Diplo accentuated the club aesthetic of his Hollertronix music for a more reflective sound on his solo debut, ''[[Florida (Diplo album)|Florida]]'', which was released on the [[Ninja Tune]] imprint, [[Big Dada Records]].<ref>[http://www.ninjatune.net/bigdada/release.php?id=865 Big Dada Diplo – Florida] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040810120717/http://www.ninjatune.net/bigdada/release.php?id=865 |date=2004-08-10 }}.

Before ''Florida'''s DVD accompaniment, another DVD surfaced called ''Diplo: "Banned in Libya"'' which was released by Money Studies, the first label to release a solo project by Diplo under his original DJ name Diplodocus. It was a 45 rpm record called "Thingamajawn" for which there is also a music video System D-128 directed. Similar to the ''Florida'' DVD, ''"Banned in Libya"'' is an experimental audio and video mix of some of Diplo's original music blended with a number of other unidentified sources. His particular affinity for one genre of music called [[funk carioca|baile funk]], or favela funk, would spawn a series of mixtapes (''Favela on Blast'', ''Favela Strikes Back''), which served to bring the [[Brazil]]ian dance music of the ghettos to the United States.<ref name="bostonphoenix1"/>

It was not long before his Hooked on Hollertronix parties would provide him the success necessary to move to the next logical step and build a studio where music would become his full-time focus. With this goal in mind, Diplo built "The Mausoleum", a video studio, recording studio, record label office, gallery, and event space in Philadelphia.<ref name="phrequency1">{{cite web|url=http://www.phrequency.com/genres/electronic/DIPLO_IS_MAD_DECENT_.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715083013/http://www.phrequency.com/genres/electronic/DIPLO_IS_MAD_DECENT_.html |archive-date=2011-07-15 |title=phrequency |access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref> Since its inception, The Mausoleum has become the home to recordings by artists like [[Christina Aguilera]], [[Shakira]], M.I.A., [[Santigold]], Spank Rock, [[Plastic Little (band)|Plastic Little]], Blaqstarr, Paper Route Gangstaz, and hosted concerts by Glass Candy, Skream, [[Boys Noize]], Nicos Gun, and more.<ref name="phrequency1"/>
