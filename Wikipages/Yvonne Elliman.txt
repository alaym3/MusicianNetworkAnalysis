'''Yvonne Marianne Elliman''' (born December 29, 1951)<ref name="AMG"/> is an American singer, songwriter, and actress who performed for four years in the first cast of the stage musical ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]''. She scored a number of hits in the 1970s and achieved a US #1 hit with "[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]". The song also reached #9 on the Adult Contemporary chart and number 4 in the Uk Chart. Her cover of [[Barbara Lewis]]'s "[[Hello Stranger]]" went to #1 on the Adult Contemporary chart, and "[[Love Me (Bee Gees song)|Love Me]]" was also #5, giving her 3 top 10 singles. After a long hiatus in the 1980s and 1990s, during which time she dedicated herself to her family, she made a comeback album as a singer-songwriter in 2004.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Elliman was born and raised in the [[Manoa]] neighborhood of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]; her mother was of [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent<ref name=HonoluluAdv>[http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Feb/17/il/il01a.html Honolulu Advertiser: "Reinvigorated Elliman may invest in rock future" By Wayne Harada] February 17, 2002</ref> and her father, a salesman for [[Hellmann's and Best Foods|Best Foods]], was of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent.<ref>[http://archives.midweek.com/content/story/theweekend_coverstory/yvonne_elliman_still_rockin/ Midweek Kaui: "Yvonne Elliman: Still Rockin' - While walking in her Manoa neighborhood, Yvonne Elliman talks candidly about her roller coaster trip to stardom in the '70s when she was performing with the likes of Eric Clapton" by Rasa Fournier] May 11, 2007</ref> Elliman was musical from an early age, playing the ukulele by age four and taking piano lessons at age seven. While attending [[President Theodore Roosevelt High School]], Elliman performed in the school band on standup bass and violin. However, Elliman became most proficient on the guitar and performed as a singer and guitarist in a folk music group named We Folk formed with some schoolmates. The group fared well in local talent shows.<ref>{{cite book|last=Larkin|first=Colin|title=The Virgin encyclopedia of 70s music|year=2002|publisher=Virgin|isbn=978-1-85227-947-9|page=122}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://honoluluweekly.com/entertainment/2007/05/that-70s-show/|title=That '70s show|access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref> According to Elliman, she was truant during her senior year at Roosevelt but graduated owing to the intervention of the school's British-born band teacher, who persuaded Elliman's teachers to pass her, and encouraged Elliman herself, then 17, to relocate to [[London]] to pursue a musical career, which she did shortly after graduating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www3.hpu.edu/kalamalama/archive/2608/sub/People02.htm|title=Online People02|access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref><ref name="bronson">{{cite book|last=Bronson|first=Fred|title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits|year=2003|publisher=Billboard Books|isbn=978-0-8230-7677-2|page=490|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&pg=PT490}}</ref>

===London years, ''Jesus Christ Superstar''===
[[File:Jesus Christ Superstar Elliman Neeley 1973.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Elliman with [[Ted Neeley]] in the 1973 feature film ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|Jesus Christ Superstar]]''.]]

Elliman's singing career began in 1969 in [[London]], where she performed in [[bar (establishment)|bars]] and [[nightclub|clubs]]. At the time she did not like what she was singing. "I hated the music then", she recalled in a 1973 interview,<ref name="VilVoice">{{cite web|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2011/05/in_the_desert_w.php#more|title=In the Desert With 'Jesus Christ Superstar'|author=Tony Ortega|author-link=Tony Ortega|date=19 May 2011|work=Village Voice|access-date=22 March 2016}}</ref> adding, "I did it for the bread. I was into drugs and all that, and thought [[Grace Slick]] and the [[Jefferson Airplane]] was it". While still an unknown,<ref>{{cite book|last=Snelson|first=John|title=Andrew Lloyd Webber|year=2009|publisher=Yale UP|isbn=978-0-300-15113-8|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300151138/page/7 7]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780300151138|url-access=registration}}</ref> she was discovered by [[Tim Rice]] and [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]], who asked her to sing Mary Magdalene's part for the original audio recording of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'' featuring [[Ian Gillan]] singing as [[Jesus]]. After its release as an album in 1970, they invited her to join the stage show's traveling cast, which she did for four years.<ref name="bronson"/>

She had her first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] hit single in 1971 with the [[ballad]] "[[I Don't Know How to Love Him]]" from ''Jesus Christ Superstar''. Her original version was not issued as a single until a [[cover version]] by [[Helen Reddy]] started moving up the U.S. charts; appearing concurrently on the charts (a rare event, not common since the 1950s, when different releases played in different parts of the United States), Elliman's original peaked at #28, while Reddy's cover peaked at #13.<ref name="AMG"/> In the end, Elliman performed on the 1970 concept album, in the original Broadway cast (1971), and in the 1973 [[Jesus Christ Superstar (film)|film]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hischak|first=Thomas S.|title=The Oxford companion to the American musical: theatre, film, and television|year=2008|publisher=Oxford UP|isbn=978-0-19-533533-0|page=874|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XbBz3C4Gr0EC&pg=PA874}}</ref> She and [[Barry Dennen]] were alone among the cast to have performed on the original record, original Broadway production and the film,<ref name ="VilVoice"/> for which her screen performance as Mary Magdalene led to a 1974 [[Golden Globe]] nomination for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress in a Motion Picture Comedy or Musical]].<ref name="AMG"/>

===New York and disco===
In 1971, Elliman moved to [[New York City]] for the Broadway production of ''Jesus Christ, Superstar'', where she met her first husband,<ref name="Careerkokua">{{cite web|url=http://www.careerkokua.org/career/article/?id=196 |title=Yvonne Elliman: Still Rockin' |publisher=Careerkokua (Hawaii Careers Information website) |date=May 16, 2007 |access-date=26 September 2012}}</ref> Bill Oakes, who was President of [[Robert Stigwood]]'s [[RSO Records]]. Before that she was signed to [[Purple Records]], singing on [[Jon Lord]]'s album ''[[Gemini Suite]]'' in 1971 and releasing her second solo album ''[[Food of Love (album)|Food of Love]]'' in 1973. She was asked to sing backing vocals on [[Eric Clapton]]'s version of the [[Bob Marley]] song "[[I Shot the Sheriff]]" in 1974. She then went on tour as part of Clapton's band, and soon afterwards got her own recording contract with RSO Records. She would continue to work with Clapton, performing on his albums from 1974 to 1977, including ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'', ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'', ''[[E. C. Was Here]]'', ''[[No Reason to Cry]]'', and ''[[Slowhand]]''. A first album for the RSO label (her third in all), ''Rising Sun'', produced by [[Steve Cropper]], produced no hit singles, but her next album, ''Love Me'', produced by [[Freddie Perren]], gave her two top-20 hits, "Love Me" (written by [[Barry Gibb|Barry]] and [[Robin Gibb]]), and a Barbara Lewis cover, "[[Hello Stranger]]".<ref name="bronson"/> "Hello Stranger" topped the U.S. [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Easy Listening]] chart for four weeks, and was also a No. 15 pop hit in 1977, while "Love Me" was a No. 14 pop hit in late 1976/early 1977.<ref name="AMG"/>

Also in 1977, the [[Bee Gees]] were working on ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' and wrote "[[How Deep Is Your Love (Bee Gees song)|How Deep Is Your Love]]" for her, but Stigwood wanted the Bee Gees to perform it. Instead, she sang "[[If I Can't Have You (Bee Gees song)|If I Can't Have You]]".<ref>{{cite book|last=Bilyeu|first=Melinda|title=The Bee Gees: tales of the brothers Gibb|year=2004|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=978-1-84449-057-8|page=412|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fmJaMqqlueIC&pg=PA412|author2=Hector Cook |author3=Andrew Môn Hughes }}</ref> The song became a number-one hit on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]];<ref name="AMG"/> it is generally considered the high point of her recording career.<ref>{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=The Rough Guide to Cult Pop|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-84353-229-3|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F7hpXcrqA-8C&pg=PA141}}</ref>

A few minor top 40 hits followed in 1979, including the [[Moment by Moment (song)|title theme song]] from the film ''[[Moment by Moment]]'' and another disco track, "[[Love Pains]]", which was a major club success. She appeared in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]''  in a two-part episode ("Number One with a Bullet", 1978) as an aspiring singer, performing the song "I Can't Get You Outa My Mind" with fellow guest performer [[James Darren]]. The single "Savannah" was also a minor hit. Shortly thereafter she decided to dedicate herself to her two children.

===Return===
After a considerable hiatus, Elliman reappeared on the music scene. An album titled ''Simple Needs'', with all songs written by Elliman, was released in 2004 and re-released globally in 2007. Elliman has continued performing at [[music festival]]s, benefits, and concerts throughout the country and around the world. She also performed on a [[PBS]] special on '70s soul music in 2004, singing "If I Can't Have You." In 2014 she reunited with [[Ted Neeley]] and [[Barry Dennen]] in Verona for a special Jesus Christ Superstar event.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.verona-in.it/2014/10/15/celebration-day-in-arena-i-40-anni-jesus-christ-superstar/|title=Celebration day, in Arena i 40 anni di Jesus Christ Superstar|date=2014-10-15|work=Verona In|access-date=2018-07-05|language=it-IT}}</ref>

On August 16, 2017, Elliman was slated to sing in [[Guam]] for a Catholic School charity when she was stopped by customs for possession of [[marijuana]] and [[methamphetamine]]. After spending a night in jail, she and her husband pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance, continued with the planned concert and were allowed to return to Hawaii on probation until their March 2018 sentencing. They were ordered to perform community service and serve the remainder of a two-week sentence, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine said, "by observing courtroom proceedings of a drug offender probation program in Honolulu."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pacificnewscenter.com/yvonne-elliman-and-husband-arrested-for-alleged-drug-possession/|title=Yvonne Elliman and husband arrested for alleged drug possession {{!}} PNC News First|last=Carrera|first=Janela|date=15 August 2017|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pacificnewscenter.com/grammy-award-singer-admits-to-occasional-drug-use-to-get-through-performances/|title=Grammy award singer admits to occasional drug use to "get through" performances {{!}} PNC News First|last=Toves|first=Jolene|date=31 August 2017|language=en-US|access-date=2019-07-11}}
