'''Fever 333''' or '''the Fever 333'''<ref name="reading" /> (both stylized in [[all caps]]) is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[Inglewood, California]], United States, in July 2017. The three-piece band consists of former [[Letlive]] vocalist [[Jason Aalon Butler]], former [[The Chariot (band)|the Chariot]] guitarist Stephen Harrison and [[Night Verses]] drummer Aric Improta.

The band's debut extended play (EP), ''[[Made an America]]'', was released on March 23, 2018. The group is signed to [[Roadrunner Records]] and 333 Wreckords. Their first LP ''[[Strength in Numb333rs]]'' was released a year later and its second EP ''Wrong Generation'' was released in 2020.

==Career==
===2017–present: Formation, ''Made an America'' and ''Strength in Numb333rs''===
Prior to the disbandment of [[Letlive]], Jason Aalon Butler had met [[Travis Barker]] by chance, and decided to spend [[Super Bowl Sunday]] with him and [[John Feldmann]]. The trio spent the day discussing [[hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[afro-punk]], which developed into building a concept together of what Butler described as "something a little dangerous that was subservice: musically and in ethos".<ref name="Afropunk" /> By the time Letlive had broken up, Butler got in contact with Stephen Harrison, whose band [[The Chariot (band)|the Chariot]] had disbanded a few years prior. Butler and Harrison discussed black people's participation in rock music and the concept for a band that Butler had previously dreamed up.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ramanand |first1=Liz |title=Heavy Culture: Fever 333 on Freedom, Race, Diversity, and Identity |url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/heavy-culture-fever-333/ |access-date=7 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200607114932/https://consequenceofsound.net/2019/07/heavy-culture-fever-333/ |archive-date=June 7, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2019 interview for Guestlist.net, Butler stated:

{{quote|Essentially it's the foundation upon which the whole project rests. Change is the overarching theme, right? Something that we can talk about and all we want. But I think action and actual participation in the change you want to see is most important. So for us, the charity contingent is a very large contingent piece of the project and everything we do from playing these demonstrations tonight to merchandise to album sales there is a percentage of that, that goes to the Walk In My Shoes Foundation. A brand fund non-profit that I started that aligns with various charities. It gives you a choice online to choose which one you think you align best with. When we are playing these headline demonstrations we find a way to pair with local charities and local organizations in order to offer them a thank you for allowing us space and the time to share the community with us. That is how those all play into each other and form the idea that is Fever 333.<ref name="Guestlist" />}}

They are heavily inspired by the [[anti-racist]], [[anti-imperialist]] and [[anti-fascist]] views of the [[Black Panther Party]]<ref>{{cite journal |title=Fever 333 |journal=[[Kerrang!]] |date=31 July 2019 |url=https://www.pressreader.com/uk/kerrang-uk/20190731/281947429460631 |access-date=6 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606094252/https://www.pressreader.com/uk/kerrang-uk/20190731/281947429460631 |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> in addition to political activists such as [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Angela Davis]], [[James Baldwin]] and [[Ta-Nehisi Coates]].<ref name="They're Coming in" /><ref name="Afropunk" /> In a 2019 interview for [[Kerrang!]], Butler stated that they perceive that "[they are] speaking with the people, not for them".<ref name="Pearlman 2019" />

They have also expressed disdain for the American electoral system, with Butler specifically stating that he doesn't believe the majority of politicians to stand for the betterment of the people in general, with voters generally only considered the effects their vote would have on themselves and disregarding those often less fortunate than them.<ref name="CSI" />

The group perceive their status as a band provides them with a platform to support to project their views to a wider audience and combat social injustice,<ref name="Kerrang Announce Love Live the Innocent" /> citing that they are "trying to write the soundtrack to the revolution that we know is about to happen".<ref name="Altcorner" /> In an article for Kerrang!, Butler said that:

{{quote|Music and art have served as the catalyst for socially inclined movements for as long as we can remember, but for some reason, at a time where we are now granted the ability to see how deeply flawed our system is, we have slowed the charge for change. FEVER 333 has dedicated its entire platform to that change from its inception with its music, activism, even its own charity fund that sees a percentage of proceeds funnelled from all profits the project receives. This is not a marketing method, this is a tool for change. Please consider widening this message for the people with FEVER 333 by joining us in this effort.<ref name="Kerrang Announce Love Live the Innocent" />}}

===''Long Live the Innocent''===
''Long Live the Innocent'' was a [[live streamed]] demonstration and performance by the band on June 3, 2020. It was a response to the [[murder of George Floyd]] by police on May 25 of the same year and represented the band's condemnation of both his specific killers,<ref name="Kerrang Long Live" /> as well as [[police brutality]] and [[institutional racism]] in general. All proceeds were donated to the [[Minnesota Freedom Fund]] and [[Black Lives Matter]].<ref name="Kerrang Announce Love Live the Innocent">{{cite web |title=FEVER 333 ANNOUNCE LONG LIVE THE INNOCENT LIVESTREAM |url=https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/fever-333-announce-long-live-the-innocent-livestream/ |website=[[Kerrang!]] |access-date=6 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606094255/https://www.kerrang.com/the-news/fever-333-announce-long-live-the-innocent-livestream/ |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=ROGERS |first1=JACK |title=WATCH: FEVER 333'S PASSIONATE AND EMOTIONAL 'LONG LIVE THE INNOCENT' LIVESTREAM |url=https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/watch-fever-333s-passionate-and-emotional-long-live-the-innocent-livestream |website=[[Rock Sound]] |access-date=6 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606052014/https://www.rocksound.tv/news/read/watch-fever-333s-passionate-and-emotional-long-live-the-innocent-livestream |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[NME]] described the event a representation of solidarity with the [[George Floyd protests|communities also protesting Floyd's murder]].<ref name="NME Long Live">{{cite web |last1=Aubrey |first1=Elizabeth |title=Watch FEVER 333's powerful 'Long Live The Innocent' livestream in aid of Minnesota Freedom Fund and Black Lives Matter |url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/fever-333-announce-livestream-event-minnesota-freedom-fund-black-lives-matter-2681090 |website=[[NME]] |access-date=6 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606094252/https://www.nme.com/news/music/fever-333-announce-livestream-event-minnesota-freedom-fund-black-lives-matter-2681090 |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> In one speech that Butler gave during the event, he stated that:

{{quote|For years we’ve been fighting, due to ideals, constructs known as 'race', and the fear of each other. Right now in America, there is a fire that is being stoked, flames that are being fanned by people in power. The people are relinquishing their power{{snd}}the very power that we possess, simply by existing, as a people, as a nation, as a constituency. We are giving up our power to someone, and to people, and to a system, that does not care about us{{snd}}not the way it cares about itself.

I don’t care where you sit on this [[Political spectrum|spectrum]]: if you're able to watch the atrocities that are happening every single day{{snd}}much like our brother George Floyd being slain on the streets in front of a camera{{snd}}and you don't think that there's a problem, then you are that fucking problem.<ref name="Kerrang Long Live" />}}

Butler also criticised a number of high profile record labels and streaming services, including [[Atlantic Records]], [[Sony Music]], [[Spotify]], [[Def Jam Recordings]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] and [[Apple Music]], for not using their money to support the black community during this time, despite profiting off of black culture and music.<ref name="NME Long Live" />

The band's logo is a homage to the logo of the [[Black Panther Party]], an American [[anti-racism]] and [[revolutionary socialist]] organisation that Butler has likened the band's practices to, as "black panthers do not strike unless they are pushed into a corner to where they have no way out". The homage was approved by the designer of the Black Panther's logo and their Minister of Culture [[Emory Douglas]].<ref name="Guestlist">{{cite web |last1=Boo |first1=Becky |title=FEVER 333 INTERVIEW |url=https://guestlist.net/article/94342/fever-333-interview |access-date=6 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200606094255/https://guestlist.net/article/94342/fever-333-interview |archive-date=June 6, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>

While performing live, Butler often wears a [[bulletproof vest]] with "333" across its chest. According to an article by [[Kerrang!]], this is intended to present the American police force's increasing militarisation.<ref>{{cite journal |title=FEVER 333 PROVING WHY THEIR LIVE SHOW K!
