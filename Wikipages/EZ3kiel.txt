'''Ezekiel''' stylized as '''EZ3kiel''' is a French musical group formed in 1993 originating from La Riche, [[Tours]], France. It now consists of three members Joan Guillon (main songwriter and guitarist), Yann Nguema (former bassist in charge of visual and interactive aspect) and Stéphane Babiaud (training percussionist, multi-instrumentalist and arranger). Matthieu Fays (drummer), a founder of EZ3kiel withdrew from the group in May 2012 after twenty years of collaboration.

Vocalist Brigitte Amédomé and guitarist Florent Duytschaever participated in the project during its first years of existence (1994-1999). Stéphane Babiaud joined the group in 2007 after recording the album ''Naphtaline'' to which he actively participated. The band has been involved in parallel projects, classical music project Naphtaline Orchestra, exhibitions notably ''Les Mécaniques Poétiques d'EZ3kiel'', theatrical, poetic and musical collaborations with a great number of independent artists.
