'''Anerae Brown''' (born 1973/1974), better known by his [[stage name]] '''X-Raided''', is an [[United States|American]] rapper and a former 24th Street Garden Blocc Crip gang member.

==Early life==
Brown was raised by his mother, Shirley James 'Jaz' Brown, a clerk at the [[Sacramento County]] courthouse.<ref name="2002 X-Raided article in LA Times">{{cite web |last1=Boucher |first1=Geoff |title=Tied by music and murder |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2002-nov-17-ca-boucher17-story.html |website=Los Angeles Times |access-date=24 October 2021 |date=17 November 2002}}</ref>

==Career==

The first X-Raided album, ''[[Psycho Active]]'',  was recorded in June 1990 with Sacramento rapper [[Brotha Lynch Hung]], and released in 1992. Brown claims that the recording was made during a deadly conflict between the 24th Street Garden Blocc [[Crips]] and the Meadowview [[Bloods]], contributing to lyrics full of violence.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

In March 1992, Brown was arrested with four other gang members for murdering Patricia Harris in her home.<ref name="2002 X-Raided article in LA Times" /> He was convicted of first-degree murder with a special circumstance of gang-related [[homicide]] and was sentenced to 31 years to life in prison.

From 1993 to 1995, he recorded songs over the telephone while in jail awaiting trial. They were released on the 1995 album ''[[Xorcist (album)|Xorcist]]''. One track begins with a recording of a collect call which identifies him as "an inmate in [[Sacramento County Jail]]". This second album garnered even more attention and it was covered in various mainstream media outlets including ''[[Playboy]]'' (September 1996).

His third album, ''[[Unforgiven (X-Raided album)|Unforgiven]]'' (1998), was recorded on a [[Digital Audio Tape|DAT recorder]] smuggled in by a prison guard.<ref name="2002 X-Raided article in LA Times"/> Beats were added later by producer DJ VerbalTek. His fourth, ''Speak of the Devil'' (2000), was credited to the pseudonymous "Nefarious" in order to evade California's [[Son of Sam law|Son of Sam II law]], and his fifth, ''[[The Initiation (X-Raided album)|The Initiation]]'' (2001), was released on his own label, Madman Records.

In 2011, Brown continued recording, including work on his forthcoming album, as well as features for Sccit & Roccy of L.A.M.B, The Jacka, Mars, and G-Macc. The following year Brown released his first mixtape, Sacrifice, followed by Sacramentally Disturbed, in March.

Brown was paroled on September 14, 2018 after serving 26 years in prison.<ref name="CBS">{{cite web

Despite this he has released four albums and 13 singles under his original persona of X-Raided since his release.<ref>{{cite web
