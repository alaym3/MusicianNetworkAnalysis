'''Xandria''' is a [[Germany|German]] [[symphonic metal]] band, founded by Marco Heubaum in 1994.

==History==
Xandria was started as a project band in 1994 in [[Bielefeld]], Germany by Marco Heubaum, the band's main composer and at the time vocalist, and a friend to play drums, but disbanded in 1997 after recording one demo.

The band was restarted with a different line-up in 1999. Heubaum stepped down from the role of vocalist and was joined by local musician Roland Krueger on bass. In 2000, they recorded one demo that was released on the internet and after its release, current drummer Gerit Lamm joined the band. Nicole Tobien (credited as 'Isis') recorded the demo but then left the band to follow other plans and was replaced by [[Lisa Middelhauve|Lisa Schaphaus]]. At the same time, writing of the debut album started.

In 2002, the band signed to [[Drakkar Records]] and was joined by current lead guitarist Philip Restemeier. As work on the debut album progressed, the band started playing shows in and around Bielefeld. In the winter of 2002, the band entered the studio to record their debut album ''[[Kill the Sun]]''. They released ''Kill the Sun'' in May 2003, and it reached No. 98 on the German music charts.<ref name=ML>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Xandria/?type=longplay |title=Xandria — Longplay-Chartverfolgung |language=de |work=musicline.de |publisher=PhononeNicole TobienNicole Tobient GmbH |access-date=5 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010132340/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Xandria/?type=longplay |archive-date=10 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> To promote the album, the band played a few shows with [[Schandmaul]] and [[Subway to Sally]]. Then they went on a three-week tour of Germany with [[Tanzwut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xandria.de/?page_id=47|title=Biography|work=Xandria|access-date=25 November 2014}}</ref>

After playing some festivals in support of ''[[Kill the Sun]]'', the band started writing their second album. Recording of the album began in December 2003 at Pleasure Park Studios, with producer José Alvarez-Brill. Production on the album was finished in February 2004. Shortly after the recordings were completed, bassist Roland Krueger left the band and was replaced by Nils Middelhauve. ''[[Ravenheart]]'' was released on May 24, 2004, and it stayed on the charts for seven weeks, reaching No. 36.<ref name=ML/>

In 2005 they released their third album, ''[[India (Xandria album)|India]]'', which reached No. 30 on the German charts.<ref name=ML/> Xandria began recording their fourth album, ''[[Salomé – The Seventh Veil]]'', on December 14, 2006. It was released on May 25, 2007 and reached No. 41 on the German charts.<ref name=ML/>

[[Lisa Middelhauve]] (née Schaphaus) resigned on April 30, 2008 citing personal reasons and discomfort in being the band's [[frontwoman]]. The band found a new singer in February 2009, Kerstin Bischof a.k.a. Lakonia, best known for her collaborations with the band [[Axxis]]. However, after just one year Kerstin Bischof decided to leave the band to concentrate on a different career, and [[Lisa Middelhauve|Middelhauve]] replaced her for a series of concerts in Summer 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135376 |title=Xandria once again looking for lead singer |date=18 February 2010 |work=[[Blabbermouth]] |access-date=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063855/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135376 |archive-date=6 June 2011 }}</ref> On December 19, 2010, Xandria announced the addition of 29-year-old singer [[Manuela Kraller]] to the group's ranks. Manuela Kraller made her live debut at the "Classic Meets Pop" event on January 7, 2011 at the Seidensticker Halle in Bielefeld, Germany.<ref>[http://www.roadrunnerreords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=151171]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

On February 24, 2012, ''[[Neverworld's End]]'' was released. It was the only album [[Manuela Kraller]] made with the band.

On February 5, 2013, the band announced on their website and Facebook page their new bass player Steven Wussow, along with the message that they would enter the studio again for their next studio album the same year.

On October 25, 2013, the band announced on their website that Kraller had left the band to pursue a different career and announced Dutch [[Ex Libris (band)|Ex Libris]] singer [[Dianne van Giersbergen]] as their new vocalist. ''[[Sacrificium (Xandria album)|Sacrificium]]'' was released in the following year. The year after, the band released their first EP titled ''[[Fire & Ashes (EP)|Fire & Ashes]]'' on July 31, 2015.

Their seventh album, ''[[Theater of Dimensions]]'' was released on January 27, 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/xandria-to-release-theater-of-dimensions-album-in-january/|title=XANDRIA To Release 'Theater Of Dimensions' Album In January|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=September 22, 2016|date=September 22, 2016}}</ref> Following the release of the album, Xandria embarked on a few shows in Europe including their first headlining tour in North America with [[Kobra and the Lotus]] and [[Once Human]] in May 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/xandria-to-tour-north-america-with-kobra-and-the-lotus-once-human/ |title=Xandria to Tour North America with Kobra and the Lotus & Once Human |date=March 17, 2017 |work=Blabbermouth.net |access-date=March 17, 2017 }}</ref> Due to personal reasons, Xandria had cancelled their upcoming second half of the US tour as well as the Russian tour. [[Aeva Maurelle]] from the band ''Aeverium'' was the temporary vocalist for the European dates in the fall.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/xandria-cancels-u-s-tour-announces-stand-in-singer-for-european-shows/ |title=XANDRIA Cancels U.S. Tour, Announces Stand-In Singer For European shows |work=Blabbermouth |date=September 12, 2017 |access-date=September 12, 2017 }}</ref>

On September 13, 2017, Dianne posted on her Facebook page that she had left Xandria. This due to having received pressure to perform from Xandria's management and the band while being physically unable to, giving her stress confirmed by doctors.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://bravewords.com/news/vocalist-dianne-van-giersbergen-i-am-leaving-xandria-emotional-audio-message-streaming |title=Vocalist DIANNE VAN GIERSBERGEN - "I Am Leaving XANDRIA"; Emotional Audio Message Streaming |magazine=BraveWords |date=September 13, 2017 |access-date=September 13, 2017 }}</ref> Two days later on September 15, 2017, ex-vocalist Manuela Kraller shared a message to the public on her Facebook page, revealing that her reason to leave four years earlier was exactly the same one. She praised Dianne for having the courage to be open about the situation to the public, which she didn't dare to at the time, but now finally did.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/manuela.kraller/posts/10214661543759254 |title=Manuela Kraller - Shocked about the news, that Dianne left... |publisher=Facebook |date=September 14, 2017 |access-date=September 15, 2017 }}</ref> Ex-vocalist Lisa Middelhauve also released a statement about Dianne's departure on the same day. She herein did not only speak about herself but also about ex-bassplayer Nils Middelhauve, whom she was married to at the time he was in the band but is now divorced from. It can be concluded that he too left Xandria under negative circumstances.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/48294212372/photos/a.437215032372.238222.48294212372/10154686766497373/?type=3 |title=Aaaand here we go.

As of 2019, the band had only performed one show, with Steven Wussow later confirmed to have become the new bass player for the German power metal band [[Orden Ogan]] on October 16, 2019, thus signalling his departure from Xandria.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockhard.de/artikel/orden-ogan-steven-wussow-als-neuer-bassist-bestaetigt_480555.html|title=ORDEN OGAN - Steven Wussow als neuer Bassist bestätigt|publisher=Rock Hard Magazine|date=October 16, 2019|access-date=February 9, 2020}}</ref> There is speculation that the band has become inactive, are looking for a new vocalist or have disbanded with no confirmation from the remaining members as of yet.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}
