'''Girls''' was an American [[indie rock]] band, formed in San Francisco in 2007. The band comprised two key members: [[Christopher Owens (musician)|Christopher Owens]], songwriter and lead singer, and [[Chet "JR" White]], who played bass and produced. Girls' sound was heavily inspired by the music of the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with their sound being described as [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], [[surf rock]], [[rock and roll]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[pop rock]], [[country rock]], and [[garage rock]].

Girls' debut full-length, ''[[Album (Girls album)|Album]],'' was released in 2009 to critical acclaim. Its 2011 follow-up, ''[[Father, Son, Holy Ghost (album)|Father, Son, Holy Ghost]]'', was also well received. On July 2, 2012, Owens announced that he was leaving the band and would continue to record as a solo artist.

==History==
===Formation and ''Album'' (2007–09)===
Owens was born into the fundamentalist cult [[Children of God (cult)|Children of God]], but absconded at the age of sixteen from their community in Slovenia to [[Amarillo, Texas]].<ref name="Hobe">{{cite web|last=Hobe |first=Hermione |title=Girls' Christopher Owens: 'I did things I won't talk about, just to survive' |date=September 11, 2011 |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/11/girls-christopher-owens-interview |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160402150339/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/sep/11/girls-christopher-owens-interview |archive-date=April 2, 2016 }}</ref><ref name="Snider">{{cite web|last1=Snider |first1=Eric |title=Girls Front Man Christopher Owens Talks Candidly (and Clearheadedly) About His Reputation as a Druggie |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-01-21/music/girls-christopher-owens-detroit-bar-costa-mesa/ |website=OC Weekly |access-date=July 10, 2017 |date=January 21, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071017/http://www.ocweekly.com/2010-01-21/music/girls-christopher-owens-detroit-bar-costa-mesa/ |archive-date=September 24, 2015 }}</ref> It took him years of exploring common technology, [[hardcore punk]] and [[nihilism]], among other things, to cope in mainstream society.<ref name="Hobe" /> He began [[busking]], which gave him an outlet and contact with the outside world.<ref name="Harmanci">{{cite web|last1=Harmanci |first1=Reyhan |title=The life story of Girls' Christopher Owens isn't too good to be true |url=http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2010-02-03/music/cult-of-personality-christopher-owens-girls-album |website=Riverfront Times |access-date=July 10, 2017 |date=February 3, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006122622/http://www.riverfronttimes.com/2010-02-03/music/cult-of-personality-christopher-owens-girls-album/ |archive-date=October 6, 2014 }}</ref> In an interview with ''[[Exclaim!]]'' magazine, Owens related much of how being part of the Children of God cult informed his childhood and his music. While there, he was not allowed to listen to music from outside the group, but was allowed to watch films from which he absorbed music like [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Guns N' Roses]]. In Amarillo, Owens was taken in by [[Stanley Marsh 3]], working as his personal assistant for four years.<ref name="Hobe" /><ref name=SecretLifeGirls>{{cite web|last1=Harmanci|first1=Reyhan|title=The Secret Life of Girls|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2009/11/03/the-secret-life-of-girls/|website=VillageVoice.com|access-date=July 10, 2017|date=November 3, 2009}}</ref>

When Owens turned 25, he moved to San Francisco, where he started making music and taking drugs such as cocaine and heroin.<ref name="Hobe" /> While in California, Owens became a member of [[Holy Shit (band)|Holy Shit]] with [[Ariel Pink]] and Matt Fishbeck.<ref name=FAQInterview>{{cite web|url=http://faqmagazine.org/ChristopherGirls.htm |title=Christopher Owens – Girls – FAQ |website=faqmagazine.org |access-date=July 10, 2017 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528235010/http://faqmagazine.org/ChristopherGirls.htm |archive-date=May 28, 2010 }}</ref> Owens then met [[Chet "JR" White]], a [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] native who was raised in [[Santa Cruz, California]], who began recording bands in his parents' garage in his teens. Upon meeting, the two developed a strong bond and interest in similar music, as well as a shared background in punk/hardcore music. Shortly thereafter, Owens and White started recording what was to later be their debut album, titled ''[[Album (Girls album)|Album]]''.

''Album'' received critical acclaim when it was released. [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] rated the single "[[Hellhole Ratrace]]" at 383 of the top 500 songs of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7685-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-500-201/3/ |publisher=Pitchfork |work=Features |title=The Top 500 Tracks of the 2000s: 500-201 |date=August 17, 2009 |access-date=September 26, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731141815/http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7685-the-top-500-tracks-of-the-2000s-500-201/3/ |archive-date=July 31, 2010 }}</ref> The same website gave the album a grade of 9.1/10 and was rated the 10th best album of 2009.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7744-the-top-50-albums-of-2009/5/ |publisher=Pitchfork |work=Staff Lists |title=The Top 50 Albums of 2009 |date=December 17, 2009 |access-date=December 21, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091221175234/http://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7744-the-top-50-albums-of-2009/5/ |archive-date=December 21, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13477-album/ |publisher=Pitchfork |work=Album Reviews |title=Girls: Album |date=September 25, 2009 |access-date=September 26, 2009 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003200927/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/13477-album/ |archive-date=October 3, 2009 }}</ref>

On July 1, 2012, Christopher Owens announced via his Twitter feed that he was leaving the band though he will continue to record music on his own.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Pelly |first1=Jenn |title=Girls Frontman Christopher Owens Leaves Band |url=https://www.pitchfork.com/news/47047-girls-frontman-christopher-owens-leaves-band/ |website=www.pitchfork.com |access-date=July 10, 2017  |date=July 2, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707042731/http://pitchfork.com/news/47047-girls-frontman-christopher-owens-leaves-band/ |archive-date=July 7, 2017 }}</ref> Owens cited the band's constantly shifting lineup as the reason for his departure, saying in an interview with ''Pitchfork'': "[W]e were replacing members for every other tour; I didn't feel like I had other people who were maturing alongside me. I counted out the amount of people that were in the band over the years. It was 21 – a giant amount of people. That's feeling disappointed 21 times over." The breaking point for Owens came when guitarist John Anderson, one of Owens' closest friends, left the band.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dombal |first1=Ryan |title=Christopher Owens |url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9007-chris-owens/ |website=pitchfork.com |access-date=July 10, 2017  |date=December 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306034200/http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/9007-chris-owens/ |archive-date=March 6, 2016 }}</ref>
