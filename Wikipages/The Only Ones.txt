'''The Only Ones''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[London]] in 1976, whose original band members are [[Peter Perrett]], [[Alan Mair]], [[John Perry (musician)|John Perry]] and [[Mike Kellie]], they first disbanded in 1982. They were associated with [[punk rock]], yet straddled the musical territory in between [[punk rock|punk]], [[power pop]] and [[hard rock]], with noticeable influences from [[psychedelia]].

The Only Ones reformed in 2007 after their biggest hit "[[Another Girl, Another Planet]]" experienced a resurgence of public interest. The band completed a comeback UK tour in June 2007, and continued touring throughout 2008 and 2009. New material was recorded in 2009 and played live, but was never released.

==History==
The Only Ones were originally formed in August 1976 in [[South London]] by [[Peter Perrett]]. Perrett had been [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] [[demo (music)|demos]] since 1972, and in late 1975 he was looking for a bass player. He was introduced to [[John Perry (musician)|John Perry]] as a possible candidate, but Perry wanted to concentrate on playing guitar instead. By August 1976, Perry and Perrett had found drummer [[Mike Kellie]] (ex-[[Spooky Tooth]]) and bass guitarist [[Alan Mair]], who previously had huge success with the Scottish band [[The Beatstalkers]].<ref>{{cite news |first=Kevin|last=Perry |title=Alan Mair interviewed about The Only Ones |url=http://thebeaverdialogues.blogspot.com/2007/05/only-ones.html |publisher=[[The Beaver (newspaper)|The Beaver]] |date=1 May 2007 |access-date=29 September 2010 | location=London}}</ref> Their first single, "Lovers of Today", self-released on the Vengeance record label, was immediately made "record of the week" by three of the four main [[music journalism|music papers]]. A year later they signed to [[CBS]]. Their next single "[[Another Girl, Another Planet]]" became a popular and influential song, and remains the band's best-known song. It is often featured on various musical box-sets featuring a [[punk rock]] or [[New wave music|new wave]] theme. After its inclusion on the 1991 compilation album ''The Sound of the Suburbs'', it was re-released as a single and reached no.&nbsp;57 in the UK singles chart.

The band released their debut studio album ''[[The Only Ones (album)|The Only Ones]]'' in 1978, which was well received by both reviewers and [[fan (person)|fans]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=only_ones |title=Only Ones |first1=Ira |last1=Robbins |first2=Scott |last2=Schinder |publisher=TrouserPress.com |access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> The band's follow-up album, ''[[Even Serpents Shine]]'', was released the following year. A year later, they released their final studio album, ''[[Baby's Got a Gun]]''. In the summer of 1980, they supported [[the Who]] on their [[The Who Tour 1980|tour of the United States]], and in 1982 the band officially disbanded. In subsequent years, the Only Ones retained a following and their posthumously released records – live performances, [[BBC Television]] and radio shows, and [[compilation album]]s – now outnumber their studio albums. Unusually, The Only Ones' [[Gramophone record|discs]] were never deleted from the CBS catalogue and remain in-print.

==Reunions==
In an interview published in the 10 November 2006 issue of the [[tabloid newspaper]], ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]'', Alan Mair commented that he was set to reform The Only Ones after "Another Girl, Another Planet" was used in a [[Vodafone]] [[Advertising campaign|ad campaign]] in 2006, and picked up as the introduction theme to Irish DJ [[Dave Fanning]]'s radio show.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline=another-whirl-&method=full&objectid=18073984&siteid=66633-name_page.html |title=Another Whirl |work=The Daily Record |date=10 November 2006 |access-date=11 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610064027/http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_headline%3Danother-whirl-%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18073984%26siteid%3D66633-name_page.html |archive-date=10 June 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> On 21 February 2007, Perry confirmed via his MySpace page that the band would reform for a five-date UK tour in June. Besides these dates, they played a number of festivals, debuting at [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival in [[Minehead]], England, on 27 April. During the summer, they also played at the two-part [[Wireless Festival]] in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, [[Harewood House]], (near [[Leeds]]), and the [[Connect Music Festival]] at [[Inveraray Castle]] in Scotland on 1 September.

News of the tour prompted coverage in several UK national newspapers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article1803475.ece |title=The Times &#124; UK News, World News and Opinion |publisher=Entertainment.timesonline.co.uk |date=4 November 2011 |access-date=11 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Alexis Petridis |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,2050209,00.html |title=Alexis Petridis on the reunion of the band the Only Ones &#124; Music |publisher=The Guardian |date= 5 April 2007|access-date=11 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref> and the dates were met with positive reviews.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dave Simpson |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/live/story/0,,2094535,00.html |title=The Only Ones, Manchester University &#124; Music &#124; The Guardian |publisher=Music.guardian.co.uk |date= 4 June 2007|access-date=11 November 2011 |location=London}}</ref> During these [[concert|gigs]], the band played a new song called "Dreamt She Could Fly".

The [[music journalism|press]] also reported that three of the band were keen to record a new studio album following the tour, but that Perrett seemed hesitant. In April 2008, the band were seen on ''[[Later... with Jools Holland]]'' performing their song, "[[Another Girl, Another Planet]]", and a new song entitled "Black Operations". The band also played other new songs including "Is This How Much You Care" and "Magic Tablet" live on a Canal+ TV special in Paris and an acoustic/unplugged session for Radio 6 Queens of Noize. A live DVD of the [[Shepherd's Bush Empire]] show was released in March 2008. Other rumoured releases included DVDs from a show on the band's last [[United States|US]] tour, and a re-release of ''Faster Than Lightning'', which was released on VHS in 1991 and on DVD in 2012.<ref>{{citation |url=http://onlyrockandroll.london/2012/03/13/faster-than-lightning-the-only-ones|title=Faster Than Lightning – The Only Ones|date=13 March 2012|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref>

All three CBS studio albums, remastered by Alan Mair, were re-released with bonus tracks in February 2009. "[[Another Girl, Another Planet]]" was used in the film ''[[D.E.B.S. (2004 film)|D.E.B.S.]]'' (2004), as well as in the 2010 hit film ''[[Paul (film)|Paul]]''. Sony BMG announced a January 2012 release date for an Only Ones [[box set]] in the "Original Album Classics" series. The set comprised the three remastered studio albums, plus various B-sides and out-takes. The Only Ones topped the bill at the 2012 Rebellion Festival in [[Blackpool]] on 4 August of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rebellionfestivals.com/ |title=Rebellion Festivals Ltd – Independent Punk and Alternative Music Festival |publisher=Rebellionfestivals.com |access-date=18 April 2012}}</ref>

In late 2014, the Only Ones (minus Mike Kellie) played some gigs in Tokyo, co-headlining with the [[Flamin' Groovies]]. In August 2014, Perrett began playing solo shows (Felipop festival, Spain) using his sons' band Strangefruit, followed by more dates in 2015 (Hebden Bridge, Bristol, London etc.) with the same formation. The band ceased activity after the death of drummer Mike Kellie, but Perrett, Mair and Perry reunited to play a three-song set in summer 2019 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dirtywaterrecords.co.uk/dwgigs/2019/7/13/somers-town-festival-2019 |title=Somers Town Festival 2019 |publisher=www.dirtywaterrecords.co.uk |access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref>

==Influence==
The band members' musical proficiency distinguished them from most of their peers. Their dominant drug-related lyrical themes on songs such as "Another Girl, Another Planet," and "The Big Sleep," also fit in with the [[Zeitgeist]] of the era on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. Perrett and Kellie caught the eye of [[Johnny Thunders]], founding member of the [[New York Dolls]] and the [[The Heartbreakers|Heartbreakers]], and worked as [[Sideman|sidemen]] on Thunders' solo debut album, ''[[So Alone (album)|So Alone]]'', notably appearing together on the classic "[[You Can't Put Your Arms Around a Memory]]". However, [[drug addiction]], particularly heroin use,<ref name=bio>{{citation |url=http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/theartsdesk-qa-musician-peter-perrett|title=Theartsdesk Q&A: Musician Peter Perrett The Only Ones' elusive frontman tells all|author=Green, Thomas H.|date=2 May 2015|access-date=15 September 2015}}</ref> derailed their career, and singer/guitarist/songwriter Perrett has only sporadically been heard from since the band split in 1982. He briefly resurfaced in the mid 1990s with the album, ''Woke Up Sticky'', and released his debut solo album, ''How The West Was Won'' in 2017.

Lead guitarist Perry went on to play as a [[session musician|session]] guitarist for artists including [[The Sisters of Mercy]], [[Evan Dando]] and [[Marianne Faithfull]]. More recently, he has written several well received music biographies on [[the Who]]'s seminal hits compilation ''[[Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy]]'',<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.salon.com/1998/12/15/sneaks_51/ |last=Zacharek|first=Stephanie|title=Meaty, Beaty, Big And Bouncy: The Who|work=Salon|date=15 December 1998}}</ref> [[the Rolling Stones]]' double album ''[[Exile on Main Street]]'' and in 2004, [[Jimi Hendrix]]'s ''[[Electric Ladyland]]''. During 2005–2006, he played and recorded with singer-songwriter [[Freddie Stevenson]].

The Only Ones have been influential on the [[indie rock]] and [[alternative rock]] scenes ever since their initial success, on bands such as [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]], [[Blur (band)|Blur]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], and more recently [[The Libertines]]. Several bands have covered their song "Another Girl, Another Planet", including The Libertines (at [[London Forum]] with Perrett guesting),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-libertines/16672|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060220022908/http://www.nme.com/news/108195.htm|archive-date=20 February 2006|title=LIBS ON ANOTHER PLANET! |work=NME|date=16 April 2004|access-date=27 December 2011}}</ref> The Replacements and [[Blink 182]]. Their song "The Whole of the Law" was covered by [[Yo La Tengo]] on their album, ''[[Painful (album)|Painful]]''.
