==History==
===2002–2003: Formation and early recordings===
Prior to forming Ultrabeat, Mike Di Scala, Chris Henry and Ian Redman previously knew each other as they were all disc jockeys in Liverpool and mixed in the same circle of friends. With a common interest in late-1990s [[happy hardcore]] music, the group decided to enter [[recording studio|studio]] for [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] sessions. Initially, their productions were bootleg versions of old happy hardcore tracks recorded in order to improve their DJ sets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubland.fm/uploads/podcasts/clublandpodcast_apr_2007.mp3|title=Clubland Podcast April 2007|access-date=2007-04-20|publisher=[[UMTV]]/[[All Around The World (record label)|AATW]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In 2002 Ultrabeat produced their first remixes and the first record by the group was a double A-side 12-inch single "Sonic Burnin'"/"Boomcore" released on  label BCD Records in January 2003. Di Scala was previously a member of [[Rezonance Q]], who had chart success with their cover of "Someday" by Mariah Carey. Di Scala played his record label Ultrabeat's [[demo (music)|demo]] of "[[Pretty Green Eyes]]", a cover of [[Force & Styles]] and following this they were also signed by the label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aatw.com/artist.php?id=128052|title=AATW Ultrabeat Artist Page|access-date=2007-10-16|publisher=[[All Around The World (record label)|AATW]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141346/http://www.aatw.com/artist.php?id=128052|archive-date=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

===2003–2007: ''Ultrabeat: The Album'' era===
"Pretty Green Eyes" went on to peak at number two on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 2003, behind "[[Breathe (Blu Cantrell song)|Breathe]]" by [[Blu Cantrell]] featuring [[Sean Paul]]. It was playlisted on most [[radio station]]s including [[BBC Radio 1]], and was performed live on ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/artists/u/ultrabeat/video/ultrabeat_pretty_green_eyes.ram BBC.co.uk]</ref> The following [[single (music)|single]] was "[[Feelin' Fine]]" which peaked at number twelve on the UK Singles Chart in December 2003. Their next release was "[[Better Than Life (song)|Better Than Life]]", which was issued the following year and peaked at number twenty three on the UK Singles Chart.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aatw.com/artist.php?id=128052|title=AATW Ultrabeat Artist Page|access-date=2007-10-16|publisher=[[All Around The World (record label)|AATW]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141346/http://www.aatw.com/artist.php?id=128052|archive-date=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The decline of their mainstream popularity came when their next single, "[[Feel It with Me]]", was released some ten months after "Better than Life". It peaked at number fifty five on the UK Singles Chart in 2005. An album (originally titled ''Better than Life: The Album'') was expected to be released around this time, although it never materialised and this upset many [[fan (person)|fans]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clubland.fm/index.php/artist/show/name/ultrabeat.html|title=Clubland Ultrabeat Artist Page|access-date=2007-10-09|publisher=[[UMTV]]/[[All Around The World (record label)|AATW]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014021103/http://www.clubland.fm/index.php/artist/show/name/ultrabeat.html|archive-date=14 October 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In April 2006 "[[Elysium (I Go Crazy)]]" was released and peaked at number thirty eight on the UK Singles Chart and put Ultrabeat back in the top forty after 17 months. This song, which sampled [[Scott Brown (DJ)|Scott Brown]]'s "Elysium", featured Rebecca Rudd on [[human voice|vocals]] for the first time with Ultrabeat. "Elysium (I Go Crazy)" was played on TV music channels more frequently than "Feel It with Me" and became one of their most popular songs. MTV viewers voted it number one on their 'Galaxy Chart'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aatw.com/artist.php?id=128052|title=Ultrabeat|access-date=2007-04-30|publisher=[[All Around The World (record label)|All Around The World]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928141346/http://www.aatw.com/artist.php?id=128052|archive-date=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/ultrabeat_top_of_the_galaxy_pops_0|title=Ultrabeat Top the Galaxy Chart|access-date=2007-10-19|publisher=[[MTV]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920020450/http://www.mtv.co.uk/channel/mtvuk/news/ultrabeat_top_of_the_galaxy_pops_0|archive-date=20 September 2007|url-status=dead|df=dmy}}</ref>

Their sixth single, "[[Sure Feels Good]]", was released in August 2007 and it was a [[collaboration]] with Darren Styles. It peaked at number fifty one on the UK Singles Chart. It was the second single featuring Rudd and along with "Elysium (I Go Crazy)" was the second collaboration with another hardcore artist. In September 2007 the band released their album, ''[[Ultrabeat: The Album]]'', which peaked at number eight on the UK Albums Chart.
