'''Joseph Michael Poole''' (born August 12, 1976), better known by his stage name '''Wednesday 13''', is an American singer and musician. Apart from his solo career, he is the frontman of the [[Murderdolls]] and has also played in several other bands, including Maniac Spider Trash, [[Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13]], [[Bourbon Crow]] and Gunfire 76.

== Career ==
=== Psycho Opera and Maniac Spider Trash ===
Poole's musical career began in 1992 when he played guitar in the band Mizery, which later became Psycho Opera, with Abby Normal (guitar), Jeff Washam (drums), Michael Patrick (bass guitar) and Todd Cage (lead vocals). Poole left the band to form Maniac Spider Trash as lead vocalist, with Normal (guitar) and Patrick (bass guitar), joined by Sicko Zero on drums. Poole fronted the band from 1992 to 1996. The band released one [[Extended play|EP]], ''Dumpster Mummies'', on Dead Hell Records in 1994. An album, ''Murder Happy Fairytales'', was recorded in 1995 but not released until October 5, 2010.

=== Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 ===
{{Main|Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13}}
Poole went on to form the [[Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13]], which included Normal and Zero. The band had several different guitarists, bass guitarists and drummers over the years, leaving Poole as the only original member. He wrote and produced every album by Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. Between 1996 and 2002, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13 released five studio albums and six [[Extended play|EPs]] with various members. They also appeared on [[tribute album]]s for [[Alice Cooper]] and [[The Sweet|Sweet]]. Zero was the last member to leave. Shortly after, Poole formed another line-up before joining [[Murderdolls]] in 2002. In May 2006, the band announced a reunion, which was followed by a tour with Alice Cooper and a box set of the band's complete discography, entitled ''Little Box of Horrors''. This line-up had Zero on drums and Normal on bass guitar. The band broke up once again shortly after the box set was released.

=== Murderdolls ===
{{Main|Murderdolls}}
Poole was contacted by [[Joey Jordison]] of [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] and was asked to join Jordison's new horror punk band, [[Murderdolls]]. Originally formed as a collaboration between Jordison and [[Tripp Eisen]] of [[Static-X]] and [[Dope (band)|Dope]], Poole became the driving force of the band after he moved from bass guitar to lead vocals. Murderdolls released one EP in 2002, ''[[Right to Remain Violent]]'', to promote a forthcoming album the same year, ''[[Beyond the Valley of the Murderdolls]]''. Most of the songs on the album were re-recorded versions of songs by Poole's previous band, Frankenstein Drag Queens from Planet 13. Two singles were released from the album, including a cover of [[Billy Idol]]'s "[[White Wedding (song)|White Wedding]]". The album reached No. 40 on the UK album chart.{{cn|date=August 2020}}

Murderdolls played their last show on January 17, 2004. After this, they broke up, with Jordison returning to Slipknot.Both Poole and Jordison maintained that the band did not split up for good, and that they would return to record a second album in the future. In February 2010, while on a solo tour in Australia, Poole told ''Drum Media'', "We're possibly going to do another Wednesday record, record it in the summer and have it out around Halloween. We're in talks right now to do another Murderdolls album. So right now I don't know which of the two is going to happen, of course if Murderdolls is possible then we have to do that, it's gotta be the number one priority. It's just talks right now. We're having the same conversations that we were having in the very beginning of the band. Right now, we're just trying to get a game plan together."

In March 2010, Jordison told ''[[Kerrang!]]'' magazine<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.kerrang.com/2010/03/exclusive_murderdolls_are_back.html |title= Murderdolls are back! |website=[[Kerrang!]] |access-date=August 20, 2010}}</ref> that Murderdolls had reunited to work with the producer Chris Harris. Jordison said, "It's been an ongoing conversation between Wednesday and I from 2006 until now. We were bored with everything out there, and thought we had something to piss people off and shake things up. Everything is such a product or a fucking formula these days... fuck formula! Fuck the norm!" Murderdolls released their second album, ''Women and Children Last'', on August 31, 2010. In March 2013, Wednesday 13 announced in an interview that the Murderdolls had split up for good in 2011{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}.

=== Wednesday 13 ===
After the Murderdolls broke up in 2004, Poole went on a solo tour of the United Kingdom in March, called the ''Graveyard A Go-Go'' tour. For his live performances, he was joined by members of the horror punk band Death Becomes You, though this was not meant to be permanent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/artists/Wednesday13/ |title=Wednesday 13 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |access-date=July 13, 2009}}</ref> Poole returned to North Carolina in June 2004 and began to put together a more permanent band, with whom he would perform under the Wednesday 13 name. He brought in the former Frankenstein Drag Queens member, Ikky, on guitar. The band is heavily influenced by [[KISS (band)|KISS]] and Alice Cooper, while not straying far from Poole's previous horror punk projects. In September 2004, Ikky was replaced by [[Matt Montgomery]]. Wednesday 13 toured Europe in November 2004 on the ''Look What the Bats Dragged in'' tour. Some of the dates were supported by the English rockers [[Viking Skull]].

In 2005, after touring, Poole released his first album ''[[Transylvania 90210]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/music/view.aspx?songID=1443 |title=Wednesday 13 – Transylvania 90210 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=April 12, 2005 |access-date=July 13, 2009}}</ref> and made a [[music video]] for the track "I Walked with a Zombie", depicting the band members in footage from the original ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' horror movie. Following the album's release, the group embarked on a tour of the United Kingdom, entitled ''Tour from the Crypt''. Also in 2005, they played on the main stage of the [[Download Festival]] at [[Donington Park|Donington]] and opened some shows for Alice Cooper around Halloween.

Poole left [[Roadrunner Records]] before signing a new deal with [[Rykodisc]], with whom he released ''[[Fang Bang]]'' on September 12, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Hammer |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/wednesday-13-is-back/ |title=Wednesday 13 is back |website=Metal Hammer |date=July 11, 2006 |access-date=July 13, 2009}}</ref> The European version of the album contains a cover of [[Motörhead]]'s "[[R.A.M.O.N.E.S.]]" and the Japanese edition has the same track listing as the European CD, with a bonus song entitled "Good Day to Die". The American edition has "Burn the Flames", a [[Roky Erickson]] cover version, as its only bonus track. ''[[Skeletons (Wednesday 13 album)|Skeletons]]'' was released in the US on April 29, 2008, available exclusively through [[Hot Topic]] locations. It was released in the UK on May 12, 2008, by DR2 Records.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dan Hammer |url=http://www.metalhammer.co.uk/news/new-wednesday-13-music-online/ |title=New Wednesday 13 music online |website=Metal Hammer |date=March 12, 2008 |access-date=July 13, 2009}}</ref>
[[File:Wednesday 13 in late 2007.jpg|thumb|Wednesday 13 performing in 2007]]
On November 14, 2008, Poole released his first live album, ''[[Fuck It, We'll Do It Live]]''. The CD/DVD package was recorded in 2008 at Crocodile Rock in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]].

The release was announced on Wednesday 13's ''[[Facebook]]'' page on December 20, 2010, and contains two songs recorded during his 2009 sessions. Of the two songs, "Xanaxtasy" was previously released in the ''Bloodwork'' EP limited edition vinyl and "It's a Wonderful Lie" was previously released on his limited edition vinyl release ''From Here to the Hearse''. During May 2011, Poole released a remix album/EP titled ''Re-Animated'' and announced that a portion of all sales for the first month would be donated to the [[American Red Cross]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=157012|title=Wednesday 13: 'Re Animated' Track Listing Revealed |website=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]]|access-date=January 31, 2015}}</ref>

Since 2005, under the alias of Buck Bourbon, Poole has maintained an [[outlaw country]] side project called [[Bourbon Crow]]. Wednesday 13 was in contact with the former drummer Jeff Washam from Psycho Opera and was going to tour on the East Coast project. Scheduling prevented Washam doing the tour. The band released its first album in 2006, ''[[Highway to Hangovers]]'', and a second album, ''Long Way to the Bottom'', in 2009. In 2015, the band released a third album, ''Off the Wagon on the Rocks''.

=== Gunfire 76 ===
Poole teamed up with [[Todd Youth]] of [[The Chelsea Smiles]] to write and record an album with a more glam rock sound and without any horror themes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=75675077&blogId=494038524|title=Wednesday 13's Official Myspace Blog|website=Myspace|access-date=October 27, 2018}}<br />- {{cite web|url=http://frantikmag.com/blog/2009/09/26/frantik-interview-gunfire-76/|title=Frantik Mag|website=Frantikmag|access-date=January 31, 2015}}</ref> under the band name Gunfire 76.
