'''Sodom''' is a German [[thrash metal]] band from [[Gelsenkirchen]], formed in 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/concerts/KREATOR_SODOM_DESTRUCTION.htm |title=Concert Reviews - KREATOR / SODOM / DESTRUCTION |publisher=Metal-Rules.com |date=2002-01-24 |access-date=2011-07-01}}</ref> They have gone through many line-up changes, leaving bassist/vocalist [[Tom Angelripper]] as the only constant member. The band is currently composed of Angelripper, guitarists [[Frank Blackfire|Frank "Blackfire" Gosdzik]] (who was a member of Sodom from 1987 to 1989 and rejoined in 2018) and Yorck Segatz, and drummer Toni Merkel. Along with [[Kreator]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] and [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]], Sodom has been referred to as one of the "Big Four" of [[Teutonic thrash metal]]. While three of those bands (except Tankard) created a sound that would influence the [[death metal]] and [[black metal]] genres, Sodom's early music style would greatly influence many late 1980s and early 1990s black metal bands more than others.

Sodom has released sixteen studio albums, three live albums, two compilation albums and seven EPs. They achieved their first commercial success with their third studio album ''[[Agent Orange (album)|Agent Orange]]'' (1989), which was one of the first thrash metal albums to enter the [[GfK Entertainment|German album charts]], where it reached number 36.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sodom - Agent Orange|url=http://www.officialcharts.de/album.asp?artist=Sodom&title=Agent+Orange&country=de|work=officialcharts.de|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref> Their most recent studio album, ''[[Genesis XIX]]'', was released on 27 November 2020.<ref name="genesis xix">{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/sodom-to-release-genesis-xix-album-in-november-cover-artwork-and-track-listing-unveiled/|title=SODOM To Release 'Genesis XIX' Album In November; Cover Artwork And Track Listing Unveiled|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=September 18, 2020|date=September 18, 2020}}</ref> Sodom is one of the best-selling thrash metal acts of all time, having sold over eight million records.<ref>{{cite web|title=SPV: ROCK OF AGES - Bringing The best Of Europe To America|url=http://www.cuttingedgerocks.com/spv_rock.html|work=cuttingedgerocks.com|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Metal Metropolis - Sodom|url=http://www.metal-metropolis.com/sodom.htm|work=metal-metropolis.com|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Sodom Interview (Tom Angelripper)|url=http://www.thewelkin.net/sodom-interview-tom-angelripper.html|work=thewelkin.net|date=February 10, 2008|access-date=January 3, 2015}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early black metal years (1981–1986)===
[[File:Sodom München 2016 (5 von 10).jpg|250x250px|thumb|Tom Angelripper live 2016]]
Sodom's original line-up consisted of [[Tom Angelripper]], Bloody Monster, Arius "Blasphemer", and Aggressor. Reportedly named in reference to the [[Venom (band)|Venom]] song "One Thousand Days in Sodom", the band was initiated by Tom as a desperate attempt to get out of having to work in [[coal mine]]s in his home town of [[Gelsenkirchen]]. The band became a cohesive unit when Chris Witchhunter (Christian Dudek) from [[Essen (Germany)|Essen]] replaced Bloody Monster on drums, bringing songwriting experience from his time in school, and spearheading the creativity process after Arius had been fired. Taking inspiration from bands such as [[Iron Maiden]], [[Judas Priest]], [[Motörhead]], [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Tank (band)|Tank]], [[Accept (band)|Accept]], [[Rainbow (rock band)|Rainbow]], [[AC/DC]] and [[UFO (band)|UFO]], the group continued as a three-piece in the Motörhead-fashion and released two demos which led to a record deal with Steamhammer. Aggressor left the band shortly before releasing the ''[[In the Sign of Evil]]'' EP (which is generally regarded as an important early [[black metal]] release), and was replaced by Grave Violator, who himself did not last long, and left following the recording of ''In the Sign of Evil''.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> Michael "Destructor" Wulf was found as a replacement, after which the band went and recorded ''[[Obsessed by Cruelty]]'', their full-length debut featuring music that was mostly in the vein of ''In the Sign of Evil.'' Wulf did not last in the band long, and later went and joined Kreator<ref name="LarkinHM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Who’s Who of Heavy Metal]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1995|edition=Second|isbn=0-85112-656-1|pages=332/3}}</ref> (where he also only had a short stint; he died after a tragic motorcycle accident in 1993).

===Change to thrash metal and increasing popularity (1987–1990)===
For the most part, Sodom was at first not taken seriously, with various press sources describing them as "a second-rate Venom clone with semi-inventive lyrics". One member would change that. [[Frank Blackfire|Frank "Blackfire" Gosdzik]] came in to fill the guitar spot Wulf had left behind. Frank convinced Tom that thrash metal was moving beyond horror/occult/satanic themes of bands like Venom to embrace political, societal, and war themes. Tom was already interested in various wars yet remained a peacenik. New inspiration culminated into Frank's full-length debut with the band, ''[[Persecution Mania]]''.<ref name="LarkinHM"/> The new lyrical approach and increased musicianship on the part of Frank gave the band great acclaim (as well as a gas-masked mascot Knarrenheinz, who appeared for the first time on ''Persecution Mania'''s cover). They subsequently toured Europe with [[Whiplash (band)|Whiplash]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], and [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]], and embarked on their only North American tour to date.<ref name="LarkinHM"/><ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|url=http://metallipromo.com/de.html|title=Destruction Tour Dates|work=metallipromo.com|access-date=6 June 2021}}</ref> After that, the band returned to the studio to make another album. The resulting album, ''[[Agent Orange (album)|Agent Orange]]'' (1989),<ref name="LarkinHM"/> sold 100,000 copies in Germany alone. It was this album that made Sodom famous, giving them worldwide critical acclaim, and secured their place alongside Kreator and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] as one of the great Teutonic thrash metal bands. To this date, ''Agent Orange'' has sold more than any other German thrash metal album in the world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2020}} In support of the album, Sodom went on tour with a then-relatively unknown [[Sepultura]].<ref name="LarkinHM"/><ref name="metallipromo"/>

Problems were brewing inside of the band, however. Tom and Chris descended further into alcoholism. Furthermore, Frank had grown tired of composing music that his bandmates would often perform poorly live. [[Mille Petrozza]] offered Frank a position with his band [[Kreator]], after they lost their second guitarist, and Frank accepted. Angelripper went out looking for a replacement and found Michael Hoffmann, formerly of German thrashers Assassin.<ref name="LarkinHM"/>

===Changes in formation (1990–1996)===
[[File:Sodom-hole in the sky-by Christian-Misje.jpg|thumb|Sodom performing at [[Hole in the Sky]] 2009]]
With a new line-up, the album ''[[Better off Dead (album)|Better off Dead]]'' was released in 1990, and another grueling tour in Europe followed, playing with bands like [[Acid Drinkers]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Accuser (band)|Accu§er]], [[Running Wild (band)|Running Wild]], [[Coroner (band)|Coroner]], [[Tankard (band)|Tankard]] and [[Atrocity (band)|Atrocity]].<ref name="metallipromo"/> During the South American tour, Hoffmann decided to stay in Brazil and was therefore forced to quit. Andy Brings replaced him, and a new album was recorded, ''[[Tapping the Vein (album)|Tapping the Vein]]'' (1992), with more of a death metal sound. This proved to be the last album with the drummer Witchhunter: He was kicked out of the band, and Atomic Steif formerly of both [[Holy Moses]] and [[Living Death (band)|Living Death]] became his replacement behind the drum kit.

On 15 September 1991, Sodom played in [[Sofia]], Bulgaria. The show was notable for the band because the audience of fifteen thousand people was one of the largest they had ever as a headliner. It was notable for the audience because it was the first show of a Western metal band in Bulgaria after the fall of communism (the only remotely similar event being a performance of the hard rock band [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]] in 1987).

The group's next album, ''[[Get What You Deserve]]'' (1994), saw them tone down the death metal sound of its predecessor in favor of a [[hardcore punk]]-influenced sound. ''Get What You Deserve'' had an arguably [[grotesque]] album cover (featuring a dead man shot and lying in his bed with a woman tied-up nearby), and many fans did not take to the band's new direction. This period also marked the beginning of less international visibility for the band as thrash lost its commercial viability for the remainder of the 1990s due to [[Grunge]] and alternative rock. Angelripper also started a solo career doing metal impressions of drinking songs, German [[Schlager music|Schlagers]] and even Christmas-type [[carols]]. A live album was recorded of the tour in support of the resulting album called ''Marooned – Live''.

''[[Masquerade in Blood]]'', saw the death metal influences return, as well as some [[groove metal]] elements kicking in,<ref name="MasqueradeInBlood">{{cite web|title=''Masquerade in Blood - Sodom'' review|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/masquerade-in-blood-mw0000615324|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|author=Eduardo Rivadavia}}</ref> but still was pretty much in the same vein as their previous studio effort. It was released in 1995. Again another guitarist had to be found. The new choice, Strahli, did not stay very long with the band. He was arrested and imprisoned on drug-related matters, and the band had since lost contact with him, until January 2011, when they learned he had died in Düsseldorf.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=153053 |title=Blabbermouth.Net - Former Sodom Guitarist Dirk Strahlmeier Dies |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=2011-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811083044/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=153053 |archive-date=2011-08-11 }}</ref> Atomic Steif also left and again Angelripper needed to search for new members. These were found: a guitarist in Bernemann and a drummer in Bobby Schottkowski. This line-up stabilized the band significantly and lasted until December 2010, when Schottkowski left.

===Return to thrash metal (1997–2009)===
[[File:SodominBKK.JPG|thumb|Sodom in Bangkok, Thailand (2007)]]
The album ''[['Til Death Do Us Unite]]'' featured a controversial album cover, depicting a woman's pregnant belly and a man's beer gut pressing in a human skull together. This album marked the beginning of Sodom's return to thrash but was still more along the lines of a thrash-crossover sound and had much in common with bands like [[Suicidal Tendencies]]. It also spawned the song for which Sodom would make their most famous music video, the highly-controversial song "Fuck the Police". After this album, Sodom returned to the studio and released ''[[Code Red (Sodom album)|Code Red]]'' in 1999 which marked a full return to the Teutonic thrash metal sound of the 1980s, and it was met with praise from fans and press alike. A limited edition featured a bonus CD containing a tribute to Sodom album, ''Homage to the Gods''. With 2001 came the release of ''[[M-16 (album)|M-16]]'', a concept album about the movie ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'', which took its title from the famed [[M16 rifle|M16]] assault rifle.

In 2003, a double live album was recorded in Bangkok, Thailand, titled ''[[One Night in Bangkok (album)|''One Night in Bangkok'']]''. A new album simply titled ''[[Sodom (album)|Sodom]]'' was released in 2006, in the same vein as ''M-16''. The title was chosen – as Angelripper explained it – "because every band needs a self-titled album", and the band had never released one. The album was delayed however, because the DVD ''Lords of Depravity'' took more time to compose than initially thought.

In 2007, Tom was asked by the record label Steamhammer for any tracks to be released on the ''In the Sign of Evil'' EP. Tom believed there were, and the label floated the idea to Tom to get ex-members Chris Witchhunter and Grave Violator (real name: Franz Josef "Peppi" Dominik) to re-record the EP with the bonus tracks. The result became ''[[The Final Sign of Evil]]''. Chris "Witchhunter" Dudek died on 7 September 2008 from liver failure after a long battle with illness.<ref name="Terr">"Remember The Fallen", ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'', Issue 176, November 2008</ref>

In 2009, Sodom returned to the UK to play their first show in 20 years at [[Bloodstock Open Air]].

Sodom released the compilation album, ''Demonized'', on 1 September 2017. Available only on cassette and 12" vinyl, it features the band's first two demo recordings, ''Witching Metal'' from 1982 and ''Victims of Death'' from 1984.

Shortly after the release of ''Decision Day'', Angelripper stated that Sodom had "some ideas for [their] next album which [they] want to bring out in 2018."<ref>{{cite web|title=INTERVIEW: Tom Angelripper – Sodom|url=http://distortedsoundmag.com/interview-tom-angelripper-sodom/|work=distortedsoundmag.com|date=September 9, 2016|access-date=August 19, 2017}}</ref>

==Musical style, influences, lyrical themes, and legacy==
In the early days Sodom's lyrics focused on Satanic and occult themes, but since ''[[Persecution Mania]]'', most of their songs have covered topics based on, inspired by, or related to the concepts of war, politics, fascism and [[world history]]. Some of their songs have also covered topics dealing with religion, rape or sexual intercourse, hatred, violence, racism and xenophobia, almost often presented in a humorous light. Their political-related lyrics had led some people to think that the band was [[militarist]], but on closer observation the listener would find the lyrics actually being anti-war. In an interview with Metalkings.com Tom Angelripper said: "Why are we writing about war? Because we don't want war. We wanna describe how bad the war is."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalkings.com/sodom/sodom.htm |title=Sodom Interview |publisher=Metalkings.com |access-date=2014-07-29}}</ref> The chorus of the song "Ausgebombt" also gives a very clear message: "No trade with death, No trade with arms, Dispense the war, Learn from the past."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Sodom/Agent_Orange/2583?songId=24114#24114 |title=Sodom - Agent Orange - Encyclopaedia Metallum |publisher=The Metal Archives |access-date=2014-07-29}}</ref>
