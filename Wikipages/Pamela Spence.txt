(novel)|They Shoot Horses, Don't They?]]'' staged in Turkey, where she had acted alongside actors [[Okan Bayülgen]] and [[Fikret Kuşkan]]. She then starred in TV [[miniseries]] such as ''Lahmacun ve Pizza'', and took part in [[Teoman (singer)|Teoman]]'s group of [[vocalists]]. Her first album, ''Eğer Dinlersen'', is the product of a long period of preparation. With the songs in her second album, ''Şehir Rehberi'', she used a style that was closer to [[rock music]], as opposed to the pop notes of her first album. One of the songs from her second album, "İstanbul", attracted particular public attention. In May 2006, she produced her third album, ''Cehennet''.
