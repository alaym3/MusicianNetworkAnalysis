It brought James acclaim and a cult following; he began to perform at techno clubs and raves across the UK and [[continental Europe]].<ref name=Barr00>{{cite book |last1=Barr|first1=Tim|title=Techno: the rough guide |date=2000|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd |location=London |isbn=9781858284347 |page=13}}</ref><ref name=Reynolds13>{{cite book |last1=Reynolds|first1=Simon|author-link=Simon Reynolds|title=[[Energy Flash|Energy Flash : a Journey Through Rave Music and Dance Culture]]|date=2013 |publisher=Faber & Faber |location=London |isbn=9780571289141 |page=165 |edition=2nd}}</ref> James co-founded the independent label [[Rephlex Records]] the same year.

James's 1992 debut album ''[[Selected Ambient Works 85–92]]'', released by Belgian label [[Apollo Records (Belgium)|Apollo]], garnered wider critical and popular appreciation. That year, he also appeared on the influential [[Warp Records]] compilation ''[[Artificial Intelligence (compilation album)|Artificial Intelligence]]''.<ref name="machines">{{cite web |last1=Cardew |first1=Ben |title=Machines of loving grace: how Artificial Intelligence helped techno grow up |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/jul/03/artificial-intelligence-compilation-album-warp-records-idm-intelligent-dance-music |website=The Guardian |access-date=12 October 2021}}</ref> He signed to Warp the following year, and subsequently released the charting albums ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'' (1994) and ''[[...I Care Because You Do]]'' (1995) and [[Top 40]] singles "[[On (EP)|On]]" (1993), "[[Come to Daddy (song)|Come to Daddy]]" (1997), and "[[Windowlicker]]" (1999). With [[music video]]s directed by [[Chris Cunningham]], "Come to Daddy" and "Windowlicker" brought James significantly wider international attention.

After releasing ''[[Drukqs]]'' in 2001, James spent several years releasing music on his own Rephlex label, including the 2005 ''[[Analord]]'' EP series, and a pair of 2007 releases under the alias '''the Tuss'''. In 2014, he made available a [[Caustic Window LP|previously unreleased 1994 LP]] as '''Caustic Window'''. He returned later that year with the album ''[[Syro]]'', which won the [[Grammy Award for Best Dance/Electronic Album]]. He has since released charting EPs including ''[[Cheetah EP|Cheetah]]'' (2016) and ''[[Collapse EP|Collapse]]'' (2018).

===1992–1994: ''Selected Ambient Works'' and early success===
{{main|Selected Ambient Works 85–92|Selected Ambient Works Volume 2|...I Care Because You Do}}

The first full-length Aphex Twin album, ''[[Selected Ambient Works 85–92]]'', comprised material dating back to James' teen years. It was released in November 1992<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apollorecords.bandcamp.com/album/selected-ambient-works-85-92|title=Selected Ambient Works 85-92, Apollo Records Bandcamp|work=Bandcamp|access-date=14 February 2019}}</ref> by [[Apollo Records (Belgium)|Apollo Records]], a subsidiary of Belgian label [[R&S Records|R&S]]. John Bush of [[Allmusic]] would later describe the release as a watershed moment in ambient music.<ref name="bush" /> In a 2002  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' record review Pat Blashill noted that Aphex Twin had "expanded way beyond the [[ambient music]] of [[Brian Eno]] by fusing lush soundscapes with oceanic beats and bass lines," demonstrating that "techno could be more than druggy dance music".<ref name="blashill">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aphextwin/albums/album/218371/review/6067595/selected_ambient_works_8592 |title=Selected Ambient Works 85–92 |access-date=2008-06-14 |last=Blashill |first=Pat |date=19 November 2002 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612021837/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/aphextwin/albums/album/218371/review/6067595/selected_ambient_works_8592 |archive-date=12 June 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Writing for [[Pitchfork (website)|''Pitchfork'']] in 2002, David Pecoraro called it "among the most interesting music ever created with a keyboard and a computer".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/223-selected-ambient-works-85-92/ |title=Selected Ambient Works 85–92 |access-date=2008-10-19 |last=Pecoraro |first=David |date=20 February 2002 |work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080920140017/http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/14986-selected-ambient-works-85-92| archive-date= 20 September 2008 | url-status=live}}</ref> ''[[DJ Mag]]'s'' Ben Murphy named it "a seminal record in the IDM, ambient and experimental canon".<ref name=MurphyDJ19>{{cite magazine |last=Murphy|first=Ben|date=3 January 2019 |title=How Aphex Twin's 'Selected Ambient Works 85–92' Refined Dance Music|url=https://djmag.com/content/solid-gold-how-aphex-twins-‘selected-ambient-works-85-92’-refined-dance-music|magazine=[[DJ Mag]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411100649/https://djmag.com/content/solid-gold-how-aphex-twins-‘selected-ambient-works-85-92’-refined-dance-music |archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live |publisher=Thrust Publishing Ltd|location=London |access-date=10 May 2019}}</ref>

James was part of several tours in 1993.

Warp released the second Aphex Twin album, ''[[Selected Ambient Works Volume II]]'', in 1994, which explored a more ambient sound, inspired by [[Lucid dreaming|lucid dreams]] and [[synesthesia]].

''[[Richard D. James Album]]'', James' fourth studio album as Aphex Twin, was released on Warp in 1996. It features [[Softsynth|software synthesisers]] and unconventional rhythms. Will Hermes of ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'' discussed James' use of [[Old school jungle|jungle]] elements, writing that "by applying junglist strategies to his own obsessive sound creation - his gorgeous weirdo palette of modernist strings, whirring crib toys, and agitated machines - he remakes drum'n'bass in his own image".<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=12|issue=11|date=February 1997|last1=Hermes|first1=Will|author-link=Will Hermes|page=88|issn=0886-3032}}</ref> In a ''Pitchfork'' list of the best albums of the 1990s, Eric Carr wrote that ''Richard D.

[[File:Aphex Twin, 2008.jpg|thumb|James performing in 2008|alt=]]
In 2001 Aphex Twin released ''[[Drukqs]]'', an experimental double album featuring abrasive, meticulous programming and [[disklavier|computer-controlled piano]] influenced by [[Erik Satie]] and [[John Cage]]. It features the piano composition "[[Avril 14th]]", which remains perhaps James's best known work.<ref name=":03">{{Cite web|url=https://www.factmag.com/2017/04/14/aphex-twin-avril-14th/|title=How Aphex Twin's piano lullaby 'Avril 14th' became a runaway pop culture hit|date=2017-04-14|website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music.|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> The album polarised reviewers. James told interviewers he had accidentally left an MP3 player with new tracks on a plane, and had rushed the album release to preempt an [[internet leak]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Synths, drukqs and rock'n'roll |url=https://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/08/1073437402717.html |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=9 January 2004 |access-date=2008-06-14 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080612015041/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/01/08/1073437402717.html| archive-date= 12 June 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref>

In 2001, James also released a short EP, ''[[2 Remixes By AFX]]'', with remixes of songs by [[808 State]] and [[DJ Pierre]]. It also had an untitled third track, consisting of a [[Slow-scan television|SSTV]] image with high-pitched sounds which can be decoded to a viewable image with appropriate software. In 2002, James was nominated for the [[Brit Award]] for Best British Male.<ref name="Brits" />

In 2005, James released a series of vinyl EPs under the AFX name, ''[[Analord]]'', created entirely with analogue equipment. These were followed in 2006 by a compilation album of ''Analord'' tracks, ''[[Chosen Lords]].''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/240-chosen-lords/|title=AFX: Chosen Lords|website=Pitchfork.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-21}}</ref> In 2007, James released two records on Rephlex, ''[[Confederation Trough]]'' and ''[[Rushup Edge (album)|Rushup Edge]]'', under the alias the Tuss, Cornish slang for "erection".

In 2009 Rephlex Records released digital versions (in the FLAC file format) of the 11 Analord eps. Each of them (except for Analord 10) had bonus tracks, totalling 81 minutes of new music between them all. Richard later disbanded Rephlex Records, removing the website entirely.
