Bodner began performing as Uncle Sinner in 2008 as he recorded his first album ''Ballads and Mental Breakdowns'' with the help of his friend Matt McLeod (AKA Fuller Vengeance). Backed by McLeod, Bodner released his debut album on December 9, 2008.<ref name=last.fm>[https://www.last.fm/music/Uncle+Sinner/Ballads+and+Mental+Breakdowns/+wiki "Ballads and Mental Breakdowns"]. ''[[last.fm]]'', November 15, 2012.</ref>

He released a limited-time digital album of outtakes and demos titled ''A Pocketful of Glass Eyes'' in March 2014 to help raise money to purchase recording equipment for his home studio.<ref>Konztroll [https://www.gothiccountry.se/blog/53-pocketful-of-glass-eyes.html "Uncle Sinner's "A Pocketful of Glass Eyes" is released"].

His second full album, ''Let The Devil In'', was released in February 2015 and created using the funds raised from the previous album.<ref>Paul Slade, [http://www.planetslade.com/uncle-sinner.html "Uncle Sinner: Let The Devil In " (blog post)"]. ''[[Planet Slade]]'', August 18, 2018.</ref> The album continues to showcase Bodner's ability to adapt and transform old [[folk music|folk]], [[blues]], and [[gospel music|gospel]] songs to suit his own gothic style. The album was entirely self-recorded, mixed, and distributed by Bodner. In August 2018, Uncle Sinner toured [[Eastern Europe]] playing songs from his first three albums.<ref>Paul Slade, [http://www.planetslade.com/uncle-sinner.html "August 2018: Uncle Sinner live in Belgium "].
