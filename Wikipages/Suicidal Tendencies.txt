'''Suicidal Tendencies''' is an American [[hardcore punk]] band formed in 1980<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kowalewski |first=Al |title=Suicidal Tendencies Interview |journal=[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]] |date=December 1982 |url=http://www.killfromtheheart.com/interviews.php?id=117}}</ref> in [[Venice, Los Angeles|Venice]], [[California]], by vocalist [[Mike Muir]], who is the only remaining original member of the band. Along with [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Corrosion of Conformity]], and [[Stormtroopers of Death]], they are often credited as one of "the fathers of [[crossover thrash]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hmmagazine.com/blog/feature/suicidal-tendencies-says/|title=Suicidal Tendencies Says - HM Magazine|website=Hmmagazine.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolifetilmetal.com/dri.htm|title=No Life Metal - CD Gallery - D.R.I.|website=Nolifetilmetal.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.excite.com/events/concert-tickets/Suicidal-Tendencies/index.php|title=Suicidal Tendencies Tickets|website=Excite.com}}</ref> Their current lineup includes Muir, guitarists [[Dean Pleasants]] and [[Ben Weinman]], bassist Ra Díaz and drummer [[Dave Lombardo]]. Notable musicians who have contributed to the band's studio or live activities include guitarists [[Rocky George]] and [[Mike Clark (guitarist)|Mike Clark]], bassists Louiche Mayorga, [[Robert Trujillo]], [[Josh Paul (musician)|Josh Paul]] and [[Thundercat (musician)|Stephen "Thundercat" Bruner]], and drummers Amery Smith, [[Jimmy DeGrasso]], [[Brooks Wackerman]], [[David Hidalgo Jr.]], [[Thomas Pridgen]] and session musician [[Josh Freese]].

Suicidal Tendencies have released thirteen studio albums (four of which are composed of re-recorded or previously released material), two [[Extended play|EP]]s, four split albums, four compilation albums, and two long-form videos. The band achieved their first success with their 1983 [[Suicidal Tendencies (album)|self-titled debut album]]; it spawned the single "[[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]", which was one of the first [[hardcore punk]] videos to receive substantial airplay on [[MTV]]. After releasing one new song on the split release ''Welcome to Venice'' (1985) and their second studio album ''[[Join the Army]]'' (1987), Suicidal Tendencies were signed to [[Epic Records]] in 1988, and continued their commercial success with its next three albums, ''[[How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today]]'' (1988), ''[[Controlled by Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà Vu]]'' (1989) and ''[[Lights...Camera...Revolution!]]'' (1990);<ref name="Billboard.com">{{cite magazine|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Chart history|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280948/suicidal-tendencies/chart|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> the latter two were certified [[RIAA certification|Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH|title=RIAA (type in "Suicidal Tendencies" in the artist box)|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]|access-date=May 7, 2009}}</ref> Their 1992 follow-up album ''[[The Art of Rebellion]]'' was another success,<ref name="Billboard.com" /> and included three of their biggest hits "Asleep at the Wheel", "[[Nobody Hears]]" and "I'll Hate You Better".<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Chart history|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280948/suicidal-tendencies/chart?f=376|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Chart history|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280948/suicidal-tendencies/chart?f=377|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref>

After releasing two more studio albums (''[[Still Cyco After All These Years]]'' and ''[[Suicidal for Life]]''), the band broke up and severed ties from Sony and Epic in 1995. However, they reunited a year later and have continued to perform and record since then. After over a decade of work and many lineup changes, Suicidal Tendencies released their eleventh studio album with all-new material, ''[[13 (Suicidal Tendencies album)|13]]'', in 2013,<ref name="newalbum2013">{{cite web| title = SUICIDAL TENDENCIES To Release '13' Album Next Month| work = [[Blabbermouth.net]]| date = February 23, 2013| url = http://blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=186646| access-date =February 23, 2013}}</ref> followed three years later by ''[[World Gone Mad]]'' (2016);<ref name="album lombardo">{{cite web|title=Ex-Slayer Drummer Dave Lombardo In The Studio With Suicidal Tendencies|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/ex-slayer-drummer-dave-lombardo-in-the-studio-with-suicidal-tendencies/|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=May 16, 2016|access-date=May 16, 2016}}</ref> both albums were well-received by critics, and considered comebacks for Suicidal Tendencies.<ref name="Billboard.com" /><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Chart history|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280948/suicidal-tendencies/chart?f=326|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Chart history|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/280948/suicidal-tendencies/chart?f=795|magazine=Billboard.com|access-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> Their most recent releases are the EP ''[[Get Your Fight On!]]'' and an album featuring unreleased and re-recorded material ''[[Still Cyco Punk After All These Years]]'', both released in 2018.

==Band history==
===Early career, controversy, and first hiatus (1980–1986)===
Suicidal Tendencies formed in 1980 as a punk band in [[Venice, California]].<ref name="American Underground">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5554|pure_url=yes}}|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Biography|last=Prato|first=Greg|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=March 25, 2009}}</ref> The original lineup of the band consisted of Mike Muir on vocals, Mike Ball on guitar, Carlos "Egie" Egert on drums, and Mike Dunnigan on bass. After the recording of their first demo, Carlos Egert left the band and was replaced by Dunnigan's brother, Sean. Muir, at the time a student at [[Santa Monica College]], originally only intended Suicidal Tendencies as a "party band", but as they grew in notoriety he soon found the band at the center of his life. Suicidal Tendencies had a rough start including being voted "Worst Band/Biggest Assholes" in ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'' in 1982 but the following year were voted "Best New Band". There were many rumors of the band members as well as their friends and followers being involved with [[gang]]s (especially [[Venice 13]], Mexican-American gang in that area), with Muir's trademark blue [[Kerchief|bandanna]] and violence at the band's performances as evidence.<ref name="American Underground" />

In their original lineup photo, which can be seen inside their self-titled debut album, drummer Amery Smith is wearing a flipped up hat and under the bill are the markings "V13", thought to be initials for Venice 13. Smith was not a member of V13 and the hat worn in the photo was borrowed from V13 member Steve Mayorga, brother of Suicidal Tendencies bassist Louiche Mayorga.  Eventually another gang sprang up possibly named after the band, the Suicidal Cycos (also known as the Suicidals, Suis or Suicidal Boyz) with chapters in Venice, Long Beach, Santa Monica, Orange County, Oceanside, San Diego, and in San Antonio, Texas. Other punk gangs in L.A founded at that time included B.P.O & KAOS 13 formed in 1983 by Brent Alden, bassist for the well known punk band False Alarm and founder of the punk crew DDT.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

[[File:Mike Muir.jpg|left|thumb|Vocalist [[Mike Muir]] formed Suicidal Tendencies in 1980, and is their only remaining original member.]]
Suicidal Tendencies quickly gained a following and began performing at larger gigs. They recorded a demo in 1982 and were featured on the Slamulation compilation LP on [[Mystic Records]]. The song featured was "I Saw Your Mommy", which was later featured on their self-titled debut album. The Dunnigan brothers quit after these recordings, with Mike Dunnigan later joining [[Tony Alva]]'s band the Skoundrelz to be back with Mike Ball on guitar and Bela Horvath on drums. Ball stayed in the band for 2½ years before joining the Skoundrelz and was replaced by Dunnigan. Guitarist Rick Battson recorded the demo before the first album. Grant Estes learned that demo replacing him on guitar and playing on Suicidal Tendencies's first record.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stillcyco.wordpress.com/2009/08/21/entrevista-rick-battson/ |title=Entrevista – Rick Battson &#124; SUICIDAL MANIAC |website=Stillcyco.wordpress.com |date=August 21, 2009 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

In 1983 Suicidal Tendencies signed with the independent label [[Frontier Records]] and released their [[Suicidal Tendencies (album)|self-titled debut]].<ref name="American Underground" /> It was described by critic Steve Huey as "Fast, furious, and funny... Mike Muir proves himself an articulate lyricist and commentator, delving into subjects like [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[Major depressive disorder|depression]], and nonconformist politics with intelligence and humor."<ref>{{cite web|last=Huey |first=Steve |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r19322|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( Suicidal Tendencies &gt; Overview ))) |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> It contained the song "[[Institutionalized (song)|Institutionalized]]", which featured a music video that became one of the first [[hardcore punk]] videos to receive substantial MTV airplay, and greatly expanded the band's fan base. The song was featured in the 1984 film ''[[Repo Man (film)|Repo Man]]'', as well as in a 1986 episode of the TV show ''[[Miami Vice]]'' ("Free Verse", which also featured a cameo appearance of the group performing in a new wave/punk club) and in the 2008 film ''Iron Man'', where the song plays in the background as Tony Stark works on his car.<ref name="American Underground" /> Soon after the release of their debut album in 1983, Estes left the band and was replaced by Jon Nelson, former manager of the Venice-based band Neighborhood Watch. Nelson played with Suicidal Tendencies on all the early punk shows from 1983 to 1984 contributing the music for future songs like: "War Inside My Head", “You Got, I Want", "Human Guinea Pig", "You Are Forgiven" and "Look Up... (The Boys Are Back)", the latter ending up on the bands compilation record ''Welcome to Venice''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stillcyco.wordpress.com/2009/10/12/entrevista-jon-nelson/ |title=Entrevista – Jon Nelson " SUICIDAL MANIAC |website=Stillcyco.wordpress.com |access-date=May 23, 2010}}</ref> Though Nelson did not appear on any of the Suicidal Tendencies releases, there are some live recordings of the song "War Inside My Head" as well as others. All the music written by Jon Nelson was purchased by Muir upon his departure from the band for a small amount of money and a [[Flying V]] guitar. He is credited on the albums only as written by (Suicidal Tendencies) and in 1987 was erroneously listed as guitarist on the reissue of their debut album ''Suicidal Tendencies'' which was soon corrected to appropriately credit Grant Estes.

That same year was the beginning of Suicidal Tendencies's four-year recording hiatus and Mike Muir and bassist Louiche Mayorga formed the label Suicidal Records as well as the band [[Los Cycos]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videomanic.com/videos/tag/Cycos |title=Los Cycos - Its Not Easy (Welcome to Venice) |website=Videomanic.com |date=October 12, 2011 |access-date=November 4, 2011}}</ref> Jon Nelson left the group and Suicidal Tendencies were banned from playing L.A. shows from an incident at Perkins Palace (their fans tore out ten rows of seats and promoters could not get the proper insurance to hire them)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Suicidal+Tendencies/+wiki |title=Suicidal Tendencies's Biography – Discover music, videos, concerts, stats, & pictures at |website=Last.fm |date=February 11, 2009 |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref> Muir was also about to try his hand at producing as well as starting the new label.

===First comeback (1987–1988)===
[[File:Rocky George aug 2005.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lead guitarist [[Rocky George]] is credited, along with rhythm guitarist [[Mike Clark (guitarist)|Mike Clark]], for changing the musical direction of Suicidal Tendencies from [[hardcore punk]] to [[thrash metal]], resulting in the [[crossover thrash]] genre.]]
With the line-up of Muir, Louiche Mayorga, George, and Herrera, the band released their second album, ''[[Join the Army]]'', in 1987. The album was met with a mixed reaction from long-time fans due to its considerably more metal-oriented sound (an element brought to the table by Rocky George), as they were expecting another punk album. Nonetheless, ''Join the Army'' featured classic tracks such as the title track, "War Inside My Head" and "Possessed to Skate" (which featured a video, originally intended for an unsuccessful skateboard movie, which featured [[Timothy Leary]]).

Shortly afterwards, the band made some major changes. [[Rocky George]]'s metal influences (reflected in his [[Motörhead]]-esque songwriting contributions to ''Join the Army'') began in turn influencing Muir, who replaced Keven Guercio as singer for [[Mike Clark (guitarist)|Mike Clark]]'s [[speed metal]] band [[No Mercy (metal band)|No Mercy]] prior to this. Muir hired No Mercy's Clark as a rhythm guitarist for Suicidal. Clark helped handle much of the band's songwriting, which progressed into a more [[thrash metal|thrash]] oriented musical direction. He fired Mayorga, who had been trying to keep the band in punk territory, and was replaced briefly by No Mercy bassist Ric Clayton, who was replaced by Bob Heathcote. Shortly after the band was picked up by [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]] producer [[Mark Dodson]] and signed to the [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] subsidiary [[Epic Records]]. The stylistic changes and signing to a major label outraged a few long-time fans, but Suicidal Tendencies began to pick up more fans from the [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] community as well.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

The band's first release with Epic was ''[[How Will I Laugh Tomorrow When I Can't Even Smile Today]]'', released in 1988. The album was mostly stripped of the band's punk and hardcore roots, instead featuring a thrash-oriented sound with more complex song structures and a greater emphasis on instrumental skill than the band had ever shown previously. However, the album was considerably more melodic than most thrash metal albums, perhaps a lasting influence of the band's punk past. Singles and music videos were released for "Trip at the Brain" and the title track, which were successful and helped expand the bands audience. That same year the band was thanked by country musician [[Hank Williams Jr.]] at the 1988 CMA Awards. [[Hank Williams III|Williams' son]] was apparently a big fan of Suicidal Tendencies.

===Robert Trujillo-era and second hiatus (1989–1996)===
[[File:Robert Trujillo live in London 2008-09-15.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Robert Trujillo]], who was the bassist for Suicidal Tendencies from 1989 to 1995, was responsible for adding funk influences to the band's musical direction.]]
In early 1989, bassist Bob Heathcote (who at the time was a father of one child) left the band to support his family and was replaced by [[Robert Trujillo]], who joined Suicidal Tendencies right before their summer European tour with [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]].<ref name="metallipromo">{{cite web|url=http://metallipromo.com/st.html|title=Suicidal Tendencies Tour Dates|website=metallipromo.com|access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://stillcyco.wordpress.com/2009/12/20/entrevista-bob-heathcote/|title=Entrevista – Bob Heathcote|website=stillcyco.wordpress.com|access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/metallicas-robert-trujillo-looks-back-on-suicidal-tendencies-debut-album-video/|title=METALLICA's ROBERT TRUJILLO Looks Back On SUICIDAL TENDENCIES' Debut Album (Video)|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=October 22, 2020}}</ref> Later that year, Suicidal Tendencies released their fourth album (also referred to as a compilation of two [[Extended play|EPs]]), ''[[Controlled By Hatred/Feel Like Shit...Déjà Vu]]''. Although Trujillo appeared in the videos that promoted the album, he was not a member of the band at the time of its recording; bass duties were reportedly by handled by [[Rocky George]] and [[Mike Clark (guitarist)|Mike Clark]]. ''Controlled by Hatred...'' featured two versions of "How Will I Laugh Tomorrow": the video version (the original song cut down for radio/video airplay) and the "heavy emotion" version (a semi-unplugged, more mellow version of the song). The rest of the songs on the album came from previously released EPs, except "Just Another Love Song" and "Feel Like Shit...Deja Vu", with the remaining songs being No Mercy and [[Los Cycos]] covers. The album featured the hit "Waking the Dead", which at seven minutes was one of the most [[progressive rock|progressive]] tracks the band had released to date. ''Controlled By Hatred...'' eventually went [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], the first of three Suicidal albums to do so.

In 1990 Suicidal Tendencies released the album that many fans consider to be their masterpiece, and the album that almost broke them into the rock mainstream, ''[[Lights...Camera...Revolution!]]''. This album featured the same line-up as ''Controlled By Hatred...'', with Trujillo on bass guitar. The songs were much more complex than on any other Suicidal album, some songs bordering on [[progressive metal]], but also showed a new influence courtesy of Trujillo, [[funk]]. To accompany the album, Suicidal Tendencies released the [[home video]] ''[[Lights...Camera...Suicidal]]''. The album was a hit, and featured the singles "[[You Can't Bring Me Down]]", "[[Send Me Your Money]]", and the melodic thrash song "Alone". All three singles were successful and received music videos (especially "You Can't Bring Me Down"), and helped ''Lights...Camera...Revolution!'' also reach gold status. The band gained a heavy audience in the thrash metal community despite being commonly accused of "selling out" in the hardcore circle. Their first show in Los Angeles in years, as well as headlining major U.S. tours (with a variety of acts such as [[Pantera]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Armored Saint]], [[Jane's Addiction]], [[24-7 Spyz]], [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]] and [[Leeway (band)|Leeway]]), their appearance on the European [[Clash of the Titans (tour)|Clash of the Titans]] tour (with [[Megadeth]], [[Slayer]] and [[Testament (band)|Testament]]) and supporting [[Queensrÿche]] on their ''[[Empire (Queensrÿche album)|Empire]]'' tour,<ref name="metallipromo" /> helped expand their popularity.

Muir eventually became interested in the funk music that Trujillo had brought to the table of Suicidal Tendencies's influences. As a result, the two formed a [[funk metal]] side project in the vein of early [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] called [[Infectious Grooves]]. Also recruiting ex-[[Jane's Addiction]] drummer [[Stephen Perkins]] and [[Excel (band)|Excel]] guitarist [[Adam Siegel]], Infectious Grooves released their debut, ''[[The Plague That Makes Your Booty Move...It's the Infectious Grooves]]'', which featured [[Ozzy Osbourne]] singing the line "therapy" in the song "Therapy" in 1991. This helped expand Suicidal Tendencies' fan base into a wider audience that included members of the [[alternative rock]] community (funk-metal was a popular alternative-metal style at the time).

Herrera left Suicidal Tendencies in 1991 due to personal differences. The rest of the band continued as an incomplete four-piece for about a year, drafting now-famous drummer [[Josh Freese]] to record their new album which would become ''[[The Art of Rebellion]]'', released in 1992. The album was very different from anything Suicidal Tendencies had done before, but it was actually their most melodic, accessible album to date. It lessened the bands thrash influences, instead focusing on a unique, almost [[alternative metal]] sound, with more emphasis on [[funk]] and [[progressive rock]], as well as traditional [[heavy metal music|metal]] guitars. Despite the experimentation, and the fact that it was released at a time when [[grunge]] became more successful than [[hard rock]] and heavy metal, ''The Art of Rebellion'' was greeted warmly by most fans and many critics, and garnered Suicidal Tendencies their highest chart position to date on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] (reaching at number 52), and producing three hits: "Asleep at the Wheel", "[[Nobody Hears]]" and "I'll Hate You Better", all of which were successful on the Billboard singles charts.<ref name="allmusic chart">{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/suicidal-tendencies-mn0000579839/awards|title=Suicidal Tendencies - Awards|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011134345/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/suicidal-tendencies-mn0000579839/awards|access-date=March 21, 2021|archive-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref> During the accompanying tour for ''The Art of Rebellion'', the band began performing at arenas and stadiums worldwide, sharing the stage with such mainstream rock staples as [[Metallica]], [[Megadeth]], [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]], [[Guns N' Roses]], [[Queensrÿche]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]], [[Alice in Chains]], [[Faith No More]] and [[White Zombie (band)|White Zombie]],<ref name="metallipromo" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sheworn.com/category/smartwatches/|title=Smartwatches Archives|website=Sheworn.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.black-sabbath.com/tourdates/1994tour/|title=1994 Tour – Black Sabbath Online|website=Sheworn.com|access-date=September 21, 2016}}</ref> where they earned a wide reputation as an excellent live act. Also during this period, Suicidal Tendencies had found a permanent replacement for Herrera, former [[White Lion]] and [[Y&T]] drummer [[Jimmy DeGrasso]].

Now at their commercial peak, Suicidal Tendencies released ''[[Still Cyco After All These Years]]'' in 1993. The album was a re-recording of Suicidal Tendencies's self-titled debut album with three additional songs (two re-recordings of ''[[Join the Army]]'' tracks, and the B-side to the 1990 single "Send Me Your Money"). It featured singles for the new versions of "Institutionalized" and "I Saw Your Mommy", which managed to do well, as did the album. That same year also saw the release of another [[Infectious Grooves]] album, ''[[Sarsippius' Ark]]'', which included new tracks as well as demo recordings of old songs, and live tracks.

However, disturbed by their recent commercial success and fame, and fear that the band was no longer relevant in the underground, Suicidal Tendencies released ''[[Suicidal for Life]]'' in 1994. The album was intended by the band to be the least accessible album they had released, starting out by having four consecutive songs with the word "[[fuck]]" in the title, and switching to a more aggressive style than on their previous studio album. ''Suicidal for Life'' was widely considered to be a disappointing album by critics, many of which claimed Muir had "dumbed down" his lyrical approach from previous albums. Fans also had a generally mixed reaction, although their reaction was more favorable than critics'.

Muir's strategy worked, however. Despite obtaining the band's second-highest chart position on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] at number 82,<ref name="allmusic chart" /> the album did not sell nearly as well as the past four Suicidal Tendencies records (although it did sell decently on the band's reputation alone) and one of its singles, "Love Vs. Loneliness", featured a gloomy music video that hurt the song's airplay. One of the other singles, "What You Need's a Friend", did however receive good rotation on album-oriented radio stations, the most notable being [[KNAC]].<ref>{{cite web|title=KNAC A to Z Listing|url=http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|work=people.delphi.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000305154225/http://people.delphi.com/dkasper13/knac/knaca2z.html|access-date=March 21, 2021|archive-date=March 5, 2000}}</ref>

It was also around this time the band, whose contract with Epic Records had expired, began to fall apart, and folded after a tour in 1995. Muir and Trujillo continued Infectious Grooves, releasing ''[[Groove Family Cyco]]'' later that year (this album was released before Suicidal Tendencies split), but they eventually folded as well, with Trujillo joining [[Ozzy Osbourne]]'s band (and later [[Black Label Society]] and [[Metallica]]) and Muir performing as [[Cyco Miko]], releasing ''[[Lost My Brain! (Once Again)]]''. Rocky George formed the group Samsara and played in 40 Cycle Hum and [[Cro-Mags]] after Suicidal Tendencies's breakup, eventually joining [[Fishbone]]. Mike Clark joined a band called [[Creeper (band)|Creeper]], while Jimmy DeGrasso joined [[Dave Mustaine]]'s side project [[MD.45]], and eventually replaced [[Nick Menza]] in [[Megadeth]], who recruited guitarist [[Anthony Gallo]] (Suicidal Tendencies, Los Cycos) for his solo record entitled ''Life After Deth''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discoogle.com/wiki/Menza,_Nick_Biography |title=Menza, Nick Biography |website=Discoogle.com |access-date=October 11, 2011}}</ref>

A greatest hits compilation, ''[[Prime Cuts (Suicidal Tendencies album)|Prime Cuts]]'', was released in 1997, apparently against the band's will.

===Second comeback (1996–2001)===
[[File:Dean Pleasants 2008 France pic by st-math!eu under cc by sa.jpg|thumb|upright|Suicidal Tendencies' current lead guitarist [[Dean Pleasants]]. He replaced [[Rocky George]] in 1996 when the band reformed a year after their breakup.]]
Suicidal Tendencies returned in 1996. However, Rocky George, Robert Trujillo, and Jimmy DeGrasso were unable to rejoin as they were busy with other projects. Muir and Clark brought in new lead guitarist [[Dean Pleasants]] (formerly of [[Infectious Grooves]]), new bassist [[Josh Paul (Musician)|Josh Paul]] and new drummer [[Brooks Wackerman]] (formerly of [[Bad4Good]], [[Infectious Grooves]] and [[Bad Religion]], now with [[Avenged Sevenfold]]) to replace them.

The band released their first new material in almost half a decade, the ''[[Six the Hard Way]]'' EP in 1998, which also included two live tracks. Released on Suicidal Records, this EP saw the band switching back to their original [[Hardcore punk|punk metal]] and [[skatepunk]] style (with songs originally recorded by [[Cyco Miko]] covered). This, along with the absence of George and Trujillo, upset many of the bands metal-era fans, but fans of the older punk Suicidal Tendencies warmly welcomed the new style.

The band stuck to a similar formula for ''[[Freedumb]]'', released in 1999. Despite generally bad reviews from critics (who claimed that the band had "dumbed themselves down" not only lyrically, but musically as well) it was considered by fans of the band as their "comeback album", with the title track, "Cyco Vision" and "We Are A Family" becoming fan favorites (although no singles from the album were released).

The following year Suicidal Tendencies released ''[[Free Your Soul and Save My Mind]]''. Unlike its predecessor, which was more straightforward hardcore, this album saw the band covering most of the styles they had dabbled with in the past. Some songs were punk, but many of them were also [[thrash metal|thrash]]-oriented, and this was by far Suicidal Tendencies's funkiest album yet. Fans and critics greeted the album warmly, and a new single, "Pop Song", was released.

[[Infectious Grooves]] released their fourth and comeback album ''[[Mas Borracho]]'' in 2000, followed by Muir's second solo album as [[Cyco Miko]], ''Schizophrenic Born Again Problem Child'', in 2001.

Suicidal Tendencies featured a new song on the ''[[Friends & Family, Vol. 2]]'' compilation in 2001, but after then the band fell silent again.

===Third hiatus, ''Year of the Cycos'' and ''No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family'' (2002–2012)===
Wackerman (who had just joined [[Bad Religion]]) had left Suicidal Tendencies by 2001 while the band was on tour. [[Greg Saenz]] joined the band before [[Ronald Bruner Jr.|Ron Bruner]] took over drum duties and Paul also left by the following year but was replaced by his brother [[Thundercat (musician)|Steve]].  The band toured during 2003 but were forced take another hiatus in 2004 due to Mike Muir requiring surgery for a back injury.

[[File:Suicidal Tendencies @ Capitol (18 5 2011) (5770925587).jpg|left|thumb|Eric Moore was the drummer for Suicidal Tendencies between 2008 and 2015.]]
While the band failed to release an album with material, independently or otherwise, Suicidal Tendencies have continued to tour consistently since 2005. On October 29 of that year their live performance at the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] in Los Angeles was filmed. Suicidal Tendencies secured a spot in the metal/punk-rock [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave Festival]] in Australia in February and March 2007, taking in [[Brisbane]], Sydney and [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]]. They performed at the Artefact Festival in France on April 29, 2007, and performed in Istanbul, Turkey on May 29. They also headlined the [[Tuborg]] Stage at the [[Download Festival]], held at [[Donington Park]], UK on Friday June 8, 2007, and closed select shows for the ''Sounds of the Underground'' tour in San Jose, California on August 3, Irvine, California on August 4, and Mesa, Arizona on August 5. On August 1, 2008, Suicidal Tendencies headlined the Porão do Rock Festival in [[Brasília]] in front of 15,000 people. By this stage Eric Moore had replaced Dave Hidalgo on drums. During the fall of 2008, the band toured with [[Whole Wheat Bread (band)|Whole Wheat Bread]], [[Madball]], [[Terror (band)|Terror]], and [[Death by Stereo]], opening select dates. During this tour ''[[Year of the Cycos]]'' – a compilation album featuring Suicidal Tendencies, Infectious Grooves, Cyco Miko and No Mercy – was available for the first time for purchase at the concerts or from their official website. From the album, the original track "Come Alive" was released as a [[music video|video clip]], and is still their latest video clip to date. The band replaced [[As I Lay Dying (band)|As I Lay Dying]] on the first five shows of the ''No Fear Energy Music Tour'' with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]]. Suicidal Tendencies toured Europe from June through July 2009.

The first Suicidal Tendencies DVD ''[[Live at the Olympic Auditorium]]'', featuring the full show recorded in Los Angeles back in 2005, was released on January 26, 2010 by [[Fontana Distribution]] via the band's own imprint, Suicidal Records. On the same day, a [[Playlist: The Very Best of Suicidal Tendencies|best of compilation]] was released as part of the ''Playlist'' music album series issued by [[Sony BMG]].

In September 2010, Suicidal Tendencies released the album ''[[No Mercy Fool!/The Suicidal Family]]'' which consists of re-recordings of tracks from the ''[[Join the Army]]'' album and of old [[No Mercy (metal band)|No Mercy]] songs, plus the previously released "Come Alive".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=145585|title=SUICIDAL TENDENCIES: U.S. Tour Announced|website=BlabberMouth|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909151728/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=145585|archive-date=September 9, 2010}}</ref> In support of the album the band toured the US in October and November, including performing at Tucson, Arizona KFMA radio station's Fall Ball 2010 on October 24 at Pima County Fairgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/festival/1678493+KFMA's+Fall+Ball |title=KFMA Fall Ball 2010-10-24|website=Last.fm|access-date=August 30, 2013}}</ref>

===''World Gone Mad'' (2014–2017)===
In a December 2014 interview with ''[[Loudwire]]'', vocalist [[Mike Muir]] was asked if Suicidal Tendencies would release a follow-up to ''13''. He replied, "Right now I have no answer to that as far as the previous one. There were a lot of things that went on and I think for us now, if everyone said they wanted to get into the studio and there was something they really wanted to do, I'd take it into consideration.

In a February 2016 interview, Muir hinted at a new EP, followed by a new full-length studio album, inspired by then-current political climate and [[2016 United States presidential election|upcoming election]].

On March 18, 2020, Muir announced on Suicidal Tendencies' Facebook page that they are working on an "old-school vinyl release" featuring instrumental "songs from ST members and people related to ST."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/suicidal-tendencies-is-working-on-old-school-vinyl-release-featuring-instrumental-songs/|title=SUICIDAL TENDENCIES Is Working On 'Old-School Vinyl Release' Featuring Instrumental Songs|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=March 18, 2020|date=March 18, 2020}}</ref>

In 2021, the band was reportedly locked out of their own Instagram account for 3 weeks when increased flagging policies prompted by site owner Zuckerberg judged the band's name to be too potentially problematic. Ironically enough, during their entire history there have been no reported incidents of the band's fans actually committing suicide. The overall attitude of their lyrics seems to convey a message of not giving up on oneself, so Instagram's decision clearly did not delve very deeply into the details before taking this action against them which had negatively affected their ability to fully promote appearances in the Aftershock festival they were booked for. Further details from Muir himself are promised to be forthcoming regarding the matter, but he went on record saying that he hoped this event would mark the last time the band was erroneously flagged over having a controversy inspiring name.
