'''The Dandy Warhols''' are an American [[alternative rock]] band, formed in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]] in 1994 by singer-guitarist [[Courtney Taylor-Taylor]] and guitarist [[Peter Holmström]]. They were later joined by keyboardist [[Zia McCabe]] and drummer Eric Hedford. Hedford left in 1998 and was replaced by Taylor-Taylor's cousin [[Brent DeBoer]]. The band's name is a play on the name of American [[pop art]]ist [[Andy Warhol]].

The band gained recognition after they were signed to [[Capitol Records]] and released their [[Record label|major label]] album debut, ''[[...The Dandy Warhols Come Down]]'', in 1997. In 2001, the band rose to new levels of fame after their song "[[Bohemian Like You]]" enjoyed extensive exposure due to being featured in a [[Vodafone]] advertisement. The Dandy Warhols were the subject of the 2004 documentary film ''[[Dig!]]'', along with [[San Francisco]] [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] outfit [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]]. They have released 10 [[studio album]]s, two [[compilation album]]s, six [[Extended play|EP]]s, and 27 [[Single (music)|singles]] to date.

==Biography==

===Early years (1994–1995)===
[[image:EricHedford-1997-SantaCruzCA.jpg|thumb|upright=0.50|Original drummer Eric Hedford in 1997]]
The Dandy Warhols were formed in [[Portland, Oregon]] in 1994 by [[Courtney Taylor-Taylor]] and [[Peter Holmström]].<ref name="AllMusic">{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-dandy-warhols-mn0000118979 |title=The Dandy Warhols - Music Biography, Credits and Discography: AllMusic |last=Prato |first=Greg |website=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=July 28, 2012}}</ref> Soon after, drummer Eric Hedford joined,<ref name="Facebook bio">{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/TheDandyWarhols/info |title=The Dandy Warhols |year=2011 |work=[[Facebook]] |access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref> and, following an unsuccessful experiment with Taylor-Taylor's girlfriend on bass guitar, Zia McCabe joined the band as keyboardist after Taylor-Taylor saw her working in a [[coffeehouse]].<ref name="Facebook bio"/> Taylor-Taylor described the band's beginning as a group of friends who "needed music to drink to".<ref>{{cite web |last=Dib |first=Lisa |title=Interview: The Dandy Warhols |url=http://www.webwombat.com.au/entertainment/music/dandy-warhols-interview.htm |year=2008 |website=Webwombat.com.au |access-date=August 24, 2011}}</ref>

Early in their career, The Dandy Warhols performed in bars throughout Portland and became well known for their nudity-filled live shows.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.dandywarhols.com/news/a-review-i-liked/ |title=A Review I Liked « The Dandy Warhols |last=DeBoer |first=Brent |author-link=Brent DeBoer |date=August 25, 2010 |website=Dandywarhols.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909053825/http://www.dandywarhols.com/news/a-review-i-liked/ |archive-date=September 9, 2010 |url-status=live |access-date=September 23, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Dig!">{{cite video |title=[[Dig!]] |type=Motion picture |year=2004}}</ref> At their first gig in 1994, they were approached by record label [[Tim/Kerr]], who offered to pay for the recording of an album.<ref name="Addicted to Noise">{{cite web |last=Kleinedler |first=Clare |date=September 8, 1997 |title=Lounging Out with The Dandy Warhols |url=http://www.slabtown.net/articles/article_atnlounge.html |work=[[Addicted to Noise]] |access-date=October 12, 2011}}</ref> The result was 1995's ''[[Dandys Rule OK]]''. Musically, ''Dandys Rule OK'' combined elements of 1960s [[garage rock]], the then-popular [[Britpop]] genre, and a [[shoegaze]]  approach.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Signing to Capitol and ''...The Dandy Warhols Come Down'' (1996–1998)===
[[File:Ctt-austin psyche fest 2014 violet-alvarez.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.20|Courtney Taylor-Taylor performing at the [[Levitation_(festival)|Austin Psych Fest]] in 2014]]
Major record label [[Capitol Records]] were impressed by ''Dandys Rule OK'', and decided to sign the band.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Reece |first=Doug |date=June 14, 1997 |title=Capitol Betting Dandy Warhols Still 'Rule OK' on <nowiki>'</nowiki>''Come Down''.' |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |page=12 |issue=24 |volume=109}}</ref> In 1997, they released their second studio album, ''[[...The Dandy Warhols Come Down]]''. It was their second attempt at a follow-up album, after their first attempt was rejected by Capitol, who claimed it did not have any "hits".<ref name="AllMusic"/><ref name="Dig!"/> Three singles were released for ''Come Down'', all of which entered the Top 40 in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Being their first record on a major label, ''Come Down'' featured a more commercial, polished sound, abandoning the [[garage rock]] sound of the previous album in favor of a more [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[power pop]]-influenced sound.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In 1998, drummer Eric Hedford left the band after a dispute over [[royalties]], and was replaced by Taylor-Taylor's cousin Brent DeBoer.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.treblezine.com/then-i-can-dig-it/|title=...Then I Can Dig It!|last=Terich|first=Jeff|date=2005-04-24|website=Treble|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-03}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://indielibertines.net/the-dandy-warhols-original-lineup-to-play-in-portland/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120713192511/http://indielibertines.net/the-dandy-warhols-original-lineup-to-play-in-portland/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 13, 2012 |title=The Dandy Warhols Original Lineup to Play in Portland |date=March 10, 2011 |website=Indielibertines.net |access-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref>

===''Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia'' and mainstream popularity (1998–2001)===
In 2000, the band released their third studio album, ''[[Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia]]''. It was a critical and commercial success, due mainly to the single "[[Bohemian Like You]]" being featured in a popular [[Vodafone]] advertisement as well as on the TV show ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. The song has also been featured in the animated movie ''[[Flushed Away]]'' in a chase scene, and on the Original Motion Picture Soundtrack for the film ''[[Igby Goes Down]]''.

''Thirteen Tales from Urban Bohemia'' featured a less [[Distortion (music)|overdriven]] sound, with less overt [[psychedelia]] and more stylings in common with the [[power pop]] genre.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Around this time, Taylor-Taylor took out a loan to acquire an industrial warehouse space in northwest Portland, dubbed "The Odditorium" and occupying a quarter city block. The Odditorium is the band's eclectic rehearsal space and recording and mixing studio. It also serves as an art space and clubhouse for parties and other events.<ref name="Dig!"/> It opened on November 15, 2001.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dandywarhols.com/news/warhols-portland-pad-open/ |title=Warhols Portland Pad Open |last=Gothman |first=Sean |date=November 21, 2001 |website=Dandywarhols.com |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

===''Welcome to the Monkey House'' (2001–2003)===
[[File:Dandy Warhols a youthful Sonic Youth with sex appeal and cool shades (7846283284).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.50|Peter Holmström at the 2001 Frequency Festival]]
Becoming a fan of the band after seeing them play at the [[Glastonbury Festival]] in 2000,<ref>{{cite journal |title=Phone Home |journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] |last=Harris |first=John |date=June 2003 |url=http://www.slabtown.net/articles/article_mojophone.html |access-date=March 10, 2012}}</ref> [[David Bowie]] personally selected The Dandy Warhols to play at the 2002 [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] festival. Bowie and the Dandys played a rendition of [[The Velvet Underground]]'s "[[White Light/White Heat (song)|White Light/White Heat]]" together as an encore to the July 29 gig, which was billed as The New Heathens Night.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://meltdown.southbankcentre.co.uk/2002/events/double-bill-the-new-heathens-night-david-bowie--the-dandy-warhols/ |title=Double Bill: The New Heathens Night: David Bowie/The Dandy Warhols |date=June 29, 2002 |website=Meltdown.southbankcentre.co.uk |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref> The band also supported Bowie on his 2003 [[A Reality Tour]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bowiewonderworld.com/tours/2003.htm |title=David Bowie 2003 Concerts |date=June 2003 |website=Bowiewonderworld.com |access-date=September 27, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2001, the band began work on their next studio album. The result was ''[[Welcome to the Monkey House (album)|Welcome to the Monkey House]]'', released in 2003. Produced by [[Nick Rhodes]] of [[Duran Duran]], the album featured a major shift towards a 1980s-influenced [[synthpop]] sound.

The album was spearheaded by its first single, "[[We Used to Be Friends]]", which went on to become one of the band's most popular tracks, gaining exposure through use as the theme song for the American [[Cult following|cult]] television show ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', as well as an appearance in ''[[The O.C.]]'' Two further singles, "[[You Were the Last High]]" and "[[Plan A (song)|Plan A]]", were released in promotion of the album. This song was also featured in EA Sport FIFA 2004.

===''Dig!'', and other developments (2004)===
Along with band [[The Brian Jonestown Massacre]], The Dandy Warhols were the subjects of the 2004 documentary film ''[[Dig!]]''. The film captured a [[love–hate relationship]] between the two bands, highlighting the interaction of Taylor-Taylor and BJM frontman [[Anton Newcombe]]. It was recorded over the course of seven years by filmmaker [[Ondi Timoner]], and won the Documentary Grand Jury Prize at the 2004 [[Sundance Film Festival]].

In the same year, the band released a [[double album]], comprising ''The Black Album'' – the album recorded before ''...The Dandy Warhols Come Down'' that was rejected by Capitol Records and also dismissed by the band themselves<ref name="Addicted to Noise"/> – and ''Come on Feel The Dandy Warhols'', a collection of [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]], [[cover versions]] and unreleased songs.

The Dandy Warhols appeared in the 2004 film ''[[9 Songs]]'', performing a live rendition of the song "You Were the Last High" as one of the film's titular "nine songs".

===''Odditorium or Warlords of Mars'' (2004–2007)===
[[File:Dandy warhols.jpg|thumb|The Dandy Warhols at the [[Summercase]] festival in 2006]]
The Dandy Warhols started work on their next studio album in mid-2004. The result was ''[[Odditorium or Warlords of Mars]]'', released the following year. It was partially named after and recorded in the band's own studio, The Odditorium. 

''Odditorium or Warlords of Mars'' was largely a return to the psychedelic, guitar-orientated rock of ''...The Dandy Warhols Come Down'', moving away from the [[Synthesizer|synth]]-heavy sound of their previous album, ''Welcome to the Monkey House''. Two singles were released from the album: "[[Smoke It]]" and "All the Money or the Simple Life Honey". The album received a mixed response from music critics.

Around this time, the band contributed to the [[soundtrack]] of the video game ''[[Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse]]'' with a cover of "[[All I Have to Do Is Dream]]" by [[The Everly Brothers]].

On July 17, 2006, the band released a stand-alone single, "Have a Kick Ass Summer (Me and My Friends)".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/have-kick-ass-summer-me-my/id166054744 |title=Have a Kick A*s Summer (Me and My Friends) – Single by The Dandy Warhols |website=[[iTunes|itunes.apple.com]] |access-date=March 2, 2012}}</ref> The song was later re-recorded as "Mis Amigos" for their 2008 album ''...Earth to The Dandy Warhols...'' It was later featured in the downloadable song pack for the [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] video game ''[[Dance Dance Revolution ULTRAMIX 4]]'', and was also re-recorded as "Mis Amigos" for their later album ''...Earth to The Dandy Warhols''. In 2007, the band recorded the song "Good Luck Chuck" for [[Good Luck Chuck|the 2007 film of the same name]]. It was released as a digital single.

===Split with Capitol, Beat the World Records launch (2008)===
