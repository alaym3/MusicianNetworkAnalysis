==Artistry==

===Image and artistry===
The members are heavily involved in the development of their concepts and their "commitment to concept is especially impressive with live performances of songs".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = VIXX's Second US Tour Brings K-pop to NYC's Terminal 5|url = http://www.mtvk.com/articles/vixxs-second-us-tour-brings-k-pop-to-nycs-terminal-5|website = MTV K|access-date = 1 June 2015|date = 2014-12-11}}</ref> Micah Levin Isla from The Philippine Star commented, "You can be someone who'll never be truly on board with this whole K-Pop craze.

VIXX presented a musical-like stage as coming off from the-usual-concert which displays singing and dancing. VIXX led their fans to UTOPIA that they constructed".<ref>{{Cite web|script-title=ko:'콘셉트돌' 빅스, 공연돌로의 치열한 진화|url = http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1110113177%2520|access-date = 1 June 2015|date = 2015-03-30|website = Osen|language = ko|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150623120140/http://osen.mt.co.kr/article/G1110113177%2520|archive-date = 2015-06-23|url-status = dead}}</ref>

===Lyrics and musical style===
With many of their releases, VIXX has tackled themes such as hope, dreams, falling madly in love with a girl although it hurts, such in the songs "[[On and On (VIXX song)|On and On]]" ({{Korean|다칠 준비가 돼 있어}}), which literally translates into "I'm Ready to Get Hurt", "[[Voodoo Doll (VIXX song)|Voodoo Doll]]" and "[[Chained Up]]"; breaking up with their lovers "[[Love Equation]]", "Don't Want to Be An Idol"'; generally sad or dark love songs, with the themes of obsession and insanity such as the songs "[[Hyde (song)|Hyde]]" and "[[G.R.8.U]]"; and emotional breakdown in "[[Error (VIXX song)|Error]]" and the timelessness of love in "[[Eternity (VIXX song)|Eternity]]". Most, if not all of their songs, play on the depth of raw human emotion.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Which Is the Best VIXX Concept?|url = http://www.soompi.com/2016/01/30/which-is-the-best-vixx-concept/|date = 2016-02-14|website = soompi}}</ref> VIXX plays an active role producing their music, with all members participating in the ideas and concepts.<ref>{{Cite web|title =[INTERVIEW] Cuvism Magazine - "A new idol group has been born, VIXX"|url = http://fyeah-vixx.com/post/45534617399/interview-cuvism-magazine-a-new-idol-group}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title =[INTERVIEW] STARAZ January Issue - "What is Next?
