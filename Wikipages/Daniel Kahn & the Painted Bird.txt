'''Daniel Kahn & the Painted Bird''' is a Germany-based [[klezmer]] band founded by Jewish-American singer-songwriter and actor Daniel Kahn, originally from [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. The band was formed in 2005 and is based in [[Berlin]]. They have released five albums through German [[world music]] label {{Interlanguage link|Oriente Musik|lt=Oriente Musik|de}}. The name of the band comes from the title of the novel [[The Painted Bird]] by [[Jerzy Kosiński]]. 

== History ==
Daniel Kahn was born on September 11, 1978, in Detroit, Michigan. He attended the [[University of Michigan]], where he studied Theater, Playwriting, Poetry and Politics. After graduating, Daniel moved to [[New Orleans]] where he was first introduced to modern [[Jewish music]]. He then went on to live and perform in [[Detroit]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Michigan]].

== Musical style ==
Daniel Kahn coined the word "''Verfremdungsklezmer''", meaning "alienation klezmer music", to describe their music, in reference to [[Bertolt Brecht]]'s theory of [[Verfremdungseffekt]].<ref name="Forward">{{Cite web|url=https://forward.com/culture/105937/partisan-or-parasite|title=Partisan or Parasite?|website=forward.com|access-date=2021-05-05}}</ref> The group describes their music as "a mixture of Klezmer, radical Yiddish song, political [[cabaret]] and [[folk punk]]",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.paintedbird.de/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=54&lang=en|title=Daniel Kahn & The Painted Bird - Daniel Kahn & The Painted Bird|website=www.paintedbird.de|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> and it has been compared to the music of [[Tom Waits]] and [[Woody Guthrie]].

Some of the songs are written by Kahn, but many are adaptations of poems and songs by Jewish authors such as [[Mordechaj Gebirtig]], frequently with socio-political themes. The Painted Birds have had songs about varied political topics, such as [[Nakam]], a group of [[Holocaust Survivors]] who conspired to kill [[Germans]] in revenge for the [[Holocaust]], and the [[Criticism of the government response to Hurricane Katrina|government response]] to [[Hurricane Katrina]], set to the tune of ''Dos Lid fun Titanik'', a 1912 Yiddish song originally about the sinking of the [[Titanic]]. Kahn also sings songs by [[Franz Josef Degenhardt]] ''(Die alten Lieder)'', [[Heinrich Heine]] ''(Die alten Lieder)'', Bertolt Brecht, ''(Judenhure Marie Sanders'' and ''Denn wovon lebt der Mensch?)'', and [[Kurt Tucholsky]] ''(Rosen auf den Weg gestreut)'' as well as a Yiddish version of the classic [[Lili Marleen]]. In 2016 he translated [[Leonard Cohen]]'s "[[Hallelujah (Leonard Cohen song)|Hallelujah]]" into Yiddish, which he has occasionally sung at concerts since then. 

He sings in English, German and Yiddish, often mixing several languages in one song. Translating lyrics has been an interest and source of inspiration.<ref>{{Cite web|title= Russia’s klezmer revival|url=https://www.jta.org/2008/04/09/culture/russias-klezmer-revival|website=www.jta.org |publisher=JEWISH TELEGRAPHIC AGENCY|access-date=2021-05-05}}</ref> The Painted Birds have previously collaborated with Russian singing [[Vanya Zhuk]] as well as [[Michael Winograd]], [[Paul Brody]] and [[Dan Blacksberg]].
