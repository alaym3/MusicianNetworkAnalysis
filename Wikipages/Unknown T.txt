"They don't understand the reality," he said. "It's not about the music, it's about what's behind the music. You can't blame the music, or say you're giving a helping hand with no aid. They're pointing the finger at us but forgetting there's three fingers pointing back."<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Beaumont-Thomas|first1=Ben|last2=agencies|date=18 February 2020|title=Drill rapper Unknown T cleared of murder of student|language=en-GB|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/feb/18/drill-rapper-unknown-t-cleared-of-student-murder|access-date=10 July 2020|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
