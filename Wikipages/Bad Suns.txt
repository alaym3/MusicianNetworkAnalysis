==Background==
[[File:Bad Suns-3.jpg|alt=Bad Suns onstage|thumb|Bad Suns in 2012]]
Bad Suns formed in early 2012. Made up of Christo Bowman (vocals), Gavin Bennett (bass/keyboard), Miles Morris (drums), and Ray Libby (guitar). “I grew up with a lot of world music playing in the house. When I was 10, I started getting heavily interested in the guitar, and my dad began introducing me to his records from the ’70s and the ’80s. Initially [[Elvis Costello]], then to [[The Clash]], [[The Cure]], and so on,” notes Bowman, “all of these artists and bands had a big impact on me, at a young age, as far as song composition goes.” The debut EP ''Transpose'' features angst-ridden riffs and ethereal vocals reminiscent of post-punk legends of the early '80s. “I started writing my first songs at that time," Bowman continues, “Though we can now reflect on that era of music, those artists were ahead of their time in a lot of ways. That’s what’s most inspiring.”{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Inspiration comes and goes as it pleases, so a night when a song gets written is a very good night,” says Bowman.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Fred|title=Bad Suns Biography|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/5841720/bad-suns/biography|publisher=Billboard.com|accessdate=January 2, 2015}}</ref> In 2014, the band opened for British indie-pop band [[The 1975]] and later headlined a tour in small venues, such as The Troubadour in West Hollywood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2016/sep/23/cd-bad-suns-return-disappear-here/|title=Bad Suns return with Disappear Here|last1=Roos|first1=Meghan|last2=Sept. 23|website=[[San Diego Reader]]|language=en|access-date=2019-01-07|last3=2016}}</ref> The bands rising fame has led them to perform in music festivals.
