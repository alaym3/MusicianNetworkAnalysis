In 2019, the band made tech news headlines when a duo of programmers called ''Dadabots'' created a [[neural network]] trained on Archspire's music to produce a non-stop stream of technical death metal based on the band's music; Dadabots also noted that Archspire's music produced the most consistent AI results, presumably because of the high tempo and technical machine-like nature of the songs. Archspire themselves also commented on the phenomenon, jokingly referring to themselves as robots.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/xwnzm7/this-youtube-channel-streams-ai-generated-black-metal-247|title=This YouTube Channel Streams AI-Generated Death Metal 24/7|first=Rob|last=Dozier|date=April 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/latest-news/metal-science/ai-death-metal-generator-using-archspire-as-source-material|title=AI Death Metal Generator Using ARCHSPIRE As Source Material|date=April 23, 2019|website=Metal Injection}}</ref> Later that year, Aleron and Prewett appeared in a cameo in the first episode of ''[[See (TV series)|See]]''; actor [[Jason Momoa]] is a fan of the band<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/11/02/jason-momoa-recruits-archspire-members-for-new-apple-tv-show/|title=Jason Momoa Recruits Archspire Members for New Apple TV+ Show &#124; MetalSucks|date=November 2, 2019|via=www.metalsucks.net}}</ref> and asked singer Aleron to coach him for a war cry technique.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/11/see-heavy-metal-vocalist-interview-1202190546/|title=‘See’: Jason Momoa Handpicked a Metal Vocalist to Train Him For War Cry Scene|first1=Tyler|last1=Hersko|date=November 18, 2019}}</ref>
