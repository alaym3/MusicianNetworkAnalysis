'''Youssou N'Dour''' ({{IPA-fr|jusu (ɛ)nduʁ|lang}}; also known as '''Youssou Madjiguène Ndour''';<ref>Xalima, ''Youssou « Madjiguéne » devenu l’ennemi des hommes sénégalais...'' (28 November 2019) [https://xalimasn.com/youssou-madjiguene-devenu-lennemi-des-hommes-senegalais/]</ref> born 1 October 1959) is a [[Senegal]]ese singer, songwriter, musician, composer, occasional actor, businessman, and politician. In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine described him as, "perhaps the most famous singer alive" in Senegal and much of Africa.<ref>Considine, J.

N'Dour helped develop a style of popular Senegalese music known by all [[Senegambian]]s (including the [[Wolof people|Wolof]]) as ''[[mbalax]],'' a genre that has sacred origins in the [[Serer people|Serer]]<ref name="Sturman"/><ref name="coonnol"/> music [[njuup]] tradition and [[Ndut initiation rite|ndut initiation ceremonies]].<ref name="Sturman">Sturman, Janet, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9TuKDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA1925#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The SAGE International Encyclopedia of Music and Culture''], [[SAGE Publications]] (2019), p. 1926, {{ISBN|9781483317748}}.

In 2006, N'Dour was cast as [[Olaudah Equiano]] in the film ''[[Amazing Grace (2006 film)|Amazing Grace]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Olaudah Equiano (Youssou N'Dour) {{!}} guardian.co.uk Film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/pictures/image/0,,-1050329735448,00.html|access-date=28 April 2021|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>

==Early life==
[[File:YoussouNDour08TIFF.jpg|thumb|left|N'Dour at the 2008 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]]]

Ethnically,<ref>In the [[Senegambia region]] as well as many [[African culture]]s, a person's ethnicity is determined by their father's line or surname. ''[[N'Dour]]'' and its variation ''Ndure'' or ''Ndour'' is a typical Serer surname. See - [[Godfrey Mwakikagile|Mwakikagile, Godfrey]], ''The Gambia and Its People: Ethnic Identities and Cultural Integration in Africa,'' New Africa Press (2010), p. 136, 141. {{ISBN|9789987160235}}</ref> N'Dour is [[Serer people|Serer]], born to a Serer father and a [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] mother.<ref name="Sturman"/><ref name="mus me port"/> However, culturally, N'Dour is [[Wolof people|Wolof]].<ref name="mus me port">{{cite news |title=La musique me portait, c'était ma seule langue |url=https://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2005/08/12/youssou-n-dour-la-musique-me-portait-c-etait-ma-seule-langue_679658_3246.html |language=fr |date=12 August 2005|newspaper=Le Monde.fr }}</ref> He was born in [[Dakar]].<ref name="Sturman"/> He started performing at age 12 and would later perform regularly with the [[Star Band]], Dakar's most popular group during the 1970s.

Despite N'Dour's maternal connection to the traditional [[griot]] caste, he was not raised in that tradition, which he learned instead from his sibling. Although patrilineally from the noble N'Dour family, his parents' world-view encouraged a modern outlook, leaving him open to two cultures and thereby inspiring N'Dour's identity as a modern griot. As a [[Muslim]], he has often incorporated aspects of [[Islamic music]] in his work.<ref>{{cite news |title=A song and a prayer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2004/may/23/worldmusic.islam |first=Mark|last= Hudson|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 May 2004}}</ref>

==Music career==
At the age of 15, Youssou N'Dour joined [[Super Diamono]] and, in 1975, toured with the band in [[West Africa]].<ref name="Hardy">Hardy, Phil, ''The Da Capo Companion to 20th-century Popular Music'', [[Da Capo Press]] (1995), p. 682,  {{ISBN|9780306806407}}</ref><ref name="Appiah and Gates">[[Kwame Anthony Appiah|Appiah, Anthony]], [[Henry Louis Gates Jr.|Gates, Henry Louis]], ''Encyclopedia of Africa, Volume 1'', [[Oxford University Press]] (2010), p. 562, {{ISBN|9780195337709}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=A0XNvklcqbwC&pg=RA1-PA562#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>

In 1976 when N'Dour was 16 years old, he signed a contract to sing with Ibra Kasse's [[Star Band]] at Kasse's Miami club in Dakar where he would become a sensation.

In 1978, N'Dour would follow as several members of the Star Band left to form [[Étoile de Dakar]], a band that made important contributions to Senegal's newly evolving musical style called [[Mbalax]] which incorporated traditional Senegalese music into the Latin styles that had dominated Senegalese popular music.<ref>Hudson, Mark, essay in liner notes of "Once Upon a Time in Senegal", Etoile de Dakar, Sterns Music 2010, p. 14</ref> Although they quickly became one of the city's most popular bands,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/may/06/etoile-de-dakar-youssou-ndour | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Etoile de Dakar featuring Youssou N'Dour: Once Upon a Time in Senegal | first=Robin | last=Denselow | date=6 May 2010}}</ref> the group was short-lived due to internal problems. Étoile de Dakar split into two groups: Étoile 2000 and Super Étoile de Dakar.   The latter group included N'Dour,  guitarist [[Jimi Mbaye]], bassist [[Habib Faye]], and [[Talking drum|tama]] (talking drum) player Assane Thiam. Super Étoile de Dakar produced four albums on cassette in just a few months and eventually evolved into N'Dour's backing band.

By 1991, he had opened his own recording studio, and, by 1995, his own record label, Jololi.

N'Dour is one of the most celebrated [[List of African musicians|African musicians]] in history. His mix of traditional Senegalese mbalax with [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] influences ranging from [[Cuban rumba]] to [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[jazz]], and [[Soul music|soul]] has won him an international fan base of millions. In the West, N'Dour has collaborated with [[Peter Gabriel]],<ref name="G150608">{{cite web | last = Llewellyn Smith | first = Caspar | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/15/worldmusic.musicmonthly2 | title = Soundtrack of my life: Youssou N'Dour | website = Guardian.co.uk | date = 15 June 2008 | access-date = 4 January 2012 | location=London}}</ref> [[Axelle Red]],<ref name="I290598">{{cite news | last = Perrone | first = Pierre | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/music-the-song-remains-the-game-1156645.html | title = Music: The song remains the game |newspaper=The Independent| publisher = Independent.co.uk | date = 29 May 1998 | access-date = 4 January 2012 | location=London}}</ref> [[Sting (musician)|Sting]],<ref name="T121202">{{cite news | last = Hudson | first = Mark | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3587019/Supernatural-superstar.html | title = Supernatural superstar | publisher = Telegraph.co.uk | date = 12 December 2002 | access-date = 4 January 2012 | location=London}}</ref> [[Alan Stivell]],<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article990987.ece?token=null&offset=12&page=2 | title = Scotland News – Listings: Critics' choice | publisher = TimesOnline.co.uk | date = 11 January 2004 }}</ref> [[Bran Van 3000]],<ref>{{cite news | last = Gill | first = Andy | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-bran-van-3000-673995.html | title = Album: Bran van 3000 | publisher = Independent.co.uk | date = 14 June 2001 | location=London}}{{dead link|date=August 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> [[Neneh Cherry]],<ref name="I211004">{{cite news | last = Cumming | first = Tim | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/youssou-ndour-and-the-fathi-salama-orchestra-barbican-london-542612.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091114070002/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/youssou-ndour-and-the-fathi-salama-orchestra-barbican-london-542612.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 14 November 2009 | title = Youssou N'Dour and the Fathi Salama Orchestra, Barbican, London | publisher = Independent.co.uk | date = 21 October 2004 }}</ref> [[Wyclef Jean]],<ref name="T121202"/> [[Paul Simon]],<ref name="I211004"/> [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[James Newton Howard]], [[Branford Marsalis]], [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]], [[Dido (singer)|Dido]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Bruce Cockburn]], and others.

In 1994, N'Dour released his biggest international hit single, the trilingual "[[7 Seconds (song)|7 Seconds]]", a duet sung with [[Neneh Cherry]].

He wrote and performed the official anthem of the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] with [[Axelle Red]] "La Cour des Grands".<ref name="I290598"/>

In Senegal, N'Dour became a powerful cultural icon, actively involved in social issues. In 1985, he organized a concert for the release of [[Nelson Mandela]]. He was a featured performer in the 1988 worldwide [[Amnesty International]] [[Human Rights Now! Tour]] collaborating with [[Lou Reed]] on a version of the Peter Gabriel song "[[Biko (song)|Biko]]" which was produced by [[Richard James Burgess]] and featured on the Amnesty International benefit album ''The Secret Policeman's Third Ball''. He worked with the United Nations and [[UNICEF]], and he started Project Joko to open [[internet café]]s in Africa and to connect Senegalese communities around the world.

In 2003, N'Dour cancelled an upcoming American tour in order to publicly deny support for the upcoming [[2003 invasion of Iraq|American invasion of Iraq]]. In a public statement explaining his decision, N'Dour said:<blockquote>It is my strong conviction that the responsibility for disarming Iraq should rest with the United Nations. As a matter of conscience I question the United States government's apparent intention to commence war in Iraq. I believe that coming to America at this time would be perceived in many parts of the world--rightly or wrongly--as support for this policy, and that, as a consequence, it is inappropriate to perform in the US at this juncture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://robertchristgau.com/xg/rock/ndour-04.php|title=Facing Mecca|last=Christgau|first=Robert|date=2004-06-08|website=The Village Voice|access-date=2018-12-08}}</ref></blockquote>He performed in three of the [[Live 8]] concerts (in [[Live 8 concert, London]], [[Live 8 concert, Paris]] and at the [[Live 8 concert, Eden Project]] in Cornwall) on 2 July 2005, with [[Dido (singer)|Dido]].<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/03/live8.music6 | title = Dido, Youssou and the three-gig dash | work=The Observer|publisher = Guardian.co.uk | date = 3 July 2005 | location=London}}</ref> He covered [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Jealous Guy]]" for the 2007 CD ''[[Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur]]''.
