==History==
===Founding===
After meeting in school, Clemens Rehbein and Philipp Dausch finished their secondary education at Jacob-Grimm-Schule in [[Kassel]], Germany in 2012. Both were in a jazz quintet known as Flown Tones, where Rehbein played bass guitar and Dausch was a guitarist.<ref name="historynari"/> The group disbanded after the drummer left, though Dausch and Rehbein continued to collaborate, feeling they had a good connection.<ref name=mwstaff/> They combined electronic production with acoustic guitar and their own vocals and lyrics.<ref name="mchome"/> Rehbein wrote most of the songs at home, then uploaded them to YouTube, where they gradually gained a following.<ref name=mwstaff>''Music Week'' staff (March 21, 2014), "ON THE RADAR MILKY CHANCE". ''[[Music Week]]''. '''61''':9</ref>

===2013: "Stolen Dance"===

After only playing two live shows<ref name="mchome"/> over two weeks in 2013, the duo recorded their debut album in a simple home-made studio in Rehbein's childhood home.<ref name="mchome"/> Before finishing and releasing the record, they released several singles on [[SoundCloud]] and on YouTube. In an interview with Edmonton's Sonic 102.9, the band said that it took them three years to write the song "[[Stolen Dance]]". It was first uploaded to YouTube on 4 April 2013 and they had low expectations for the track.<ref>DS (June 20, 2014), "Virtually Famous Milky Chance". ''Evening Standard'' :43</ref> However, it quickly became a viral hit, racking up millions of views.<ref name="mchome"/> ''SPIN'' wrote about the video, "the clip for 'Stolen Dance' nails the visual for its artist in a way that feels definitive and not overly self-conscious. It's still without being static, evocative while not provocative, silly but never stupid."<ref name="spinsac"/> The video made the band the "most blogged about act" for that month on HypeM,<ref name="mchome"/> and as of October 2018, the video holds over 500 million views on YouTube.<ref name="youtubstolen"/> The day after the video came out, the song "Stolen Dance" was first released (on their own label Lichtdicht Records<ref name=mwstaff/>) on 5 April 2013 as a single and reached number one in Germany, Austria, Luxembourg, Switzerland, and France.<ref name=Mendizabal>Mendizabal, Amaya; Trust, Gary; White, Emily (June 21, 2014), "Tomorrow's Hits". ''Billboard''. '''126''' (20):57</ref> It also topped the charts in Belgium, Poland, Czech Republic, and Hungary.{{citation needed|date=January 2021}} It reached number one on the Billboard Alternative chart.<ref>(November 8, 2014), "ALTERNATIVE". ''Billboard''. '''126''' (22):75</ref> Their first big show was at a festival called Dockville in Hamburg, with about 5,000 people in attendance.<ref name=mwstaff/>

The band desired to "make it a little bit bigger" and reach international audiences.<ref name=mwstaff/> They performed at the [[Reeperbahn Festival]] in [[Hamburg]], Germany, and a representative from Ignition liked what he saw.<ref name=mwstaff/>  Their manager set up a meeting and they reached a distribution deal.<ref name=mwstaff/>

The band began a 100+ show tour, driving across Europe with allegedly simply "a guitar and a set of decks and some mpc."<ref name="mchome"/>

===2013: ''Sadnecessary''===

{{Main|Sadnecessary|Down by the River (Milky Chance song)}}
''[[Sadnecessary]]'' is the debut studio album by the group, released in Germany on 1 October 2013. The album includes the singles "[[Stolen Dance]]" and "[[Down by the River (Milky Chance song)|Down by the River]]". It peaked at number 14 in Germany and charted at No. 17 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart.<ref name="mchome"/> Milky Chance toured in support of the record, and on 5 December 2013, they won the 1Live Krone radio awards for Best Single with "Stolen Dance."<ref name="mchome"/>

"[[Down by the River (Milky Chance song)|Down by the River]]" was re-released as a single on 28 March 2014 in Germany through Lichtdicht Records. It charted in France, Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, and appeared in the [[EA Sports]] game ''[[FIFA 15]]''.<ref name="mchome"/> After a successful tour, "Stolen Dance" was made available in a radio edit version and on two different versions of the ''[[Stolen Dance|Stolen Dance EP]]'' in 2014, in countries such as Luxembourg , Australia, the US, Canada, and New Zealand.<ref name="lastfmmc"/>

''Sadnecessary'' was nominated for the IMPALA European Independent Album of the Year award.<ref name=mwstaff/>

===2014–2016: Sadnecessary Tour===
Milky Chance played their first show in the United States in October 2014, in a sold-out performance at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in New York City.<ref name="usatoday" /> ''Sadnecessary'' was released in the United States a year after its release in Germany, coming out on 14 October 2014. It received largely positive press from North American critics, and within a day of its release, [[Spin (magazine)|''SPIN'']] named it their Album of the Week.<ref name="spinsac" /> ''SPIN'' further described the leading single "Stolen Dance" as a "serenely rollicking crossover jam," clarifying that the song "is no red herring — the great majority of ''Sadnecessary'' follows in its pattern of low-octane beats and gently lapping guitar strumming, making for a lovely and understated album."<ref name="spinsac" />
[[File:Milky Chance live in Paris.jpg|thumb|Milky Chance live at Lollapalooza Paris, 2017]]
The band made their TV debut on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on 22 October 2014,<ref name="mchome" /> and that day they were nominated for Best Band at the German radio award show 1Live Krone.<ref name="mchome" /> They also won the [[European Border Breakers Award]] that month, and on 16 September 2014, they were nominated as Best German Act at the [[MTV European Music Awards]].<sup>[1]</sup> They toured the United States and Canada in late 2014.<ref name="mchome" /> They were also guest artists on the ''[[Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jimmy Fallon]],<ref name="nosaey" /> and they played the [[House of Blues]] in April 2015, with plans to return to Boston as part of their upcoming North American Summer Tour.<ref name="nosaey" /> Also in April, they played at the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]], with their album ''Sadnecessary'' at that point having been on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for 23 weeks.<ref name="nosaey" /> "Stolen Dance" entered the [[Shazam (service)|Shazam Hall of Fame]] at No. 15 as one of the most "shazamed" songs of all time.<ref name="rvamag" />

The band embarked on a tour that continued throughout 2015 and 2016. They visited more than 31 countries and performed more than 200 shows in North America, Europe, South Africa, and Oceania.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.milkychance.net/past-shows/|title=Milky Chance official website - Past dates}}</ref>

===2017–present: ''Blossom'' album and world tour===
Milky Chance released their second album, [[Blossom (Milky Chance album)|''Blossom'']], on 17 March 2017. ''Blossom'' was inspired by the experience Clemens and Philipp had in the previous two years and the two different worlds they had jumped into: touring and being home in their private life with family and friends.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctpost.com/entertainment/article/Milky-Chance-plays-New-Haven-s-College-Street-12494407.php|title=Milky Chance plays New Haven's College Street Music Hall|work=Connecticut Post|access-date=2018-02-23}}</ref>

''Blossom'' includes 14 songs along with "Bad Things", featuring [[Izzy Bizu]]. The first single to be released from the album was "[[Cocoon (Milky Chance song)|Cocoon]]".

The band embarked on another world tour, visiting more than 26 countries and performing more than 161 shows by February 2018.<ref name=":0" />

During their Blossom headline tour, they also played at the [[Osheaga Festival]], [[Lollapalooza]] (Chicago and Paris), [[Austin City Limits Music Festival|Austin City Limits]], and [[Groovin' the Moo]] in Australia, as well as performing on ''[[Conan (talk show)|Conan]]'', all in 2017.<ref>{{Citation|title=Zachary Levi/John Lydon/Milky Chance|date=2017-03-09|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6604090/|others=Conan O'Brien, Andy Richter, Zachary Levi|access-date=2018-02-23}}</ref>{{multiple image

Milky Chance incorporates elements of [[Folk music|folk]], [[reggae]], and [[jazz]] into their music. ''[[USA Today]]'' describes the band as "singer-songwriter with electronic beats."<ref name="clsmilkychance" /> The music publication ''[[Noisey]]'' wrote, "The pair masterfully combines [[House music|house]] and electronic beats with reggae and [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] influences; the lyrics, though, could have been written by a folk singer."<ref name="usatoday" /> The band has cited diverse artists as influences, including reggae and rock artists such as [[Bob Marley]], [[Ray Charles]], and [[John Frusciante]] of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]].<ref name="clsmilkychance" />

They use a relatively simple equipment setup in the studio, and their debut releases were recorded with only a [[MacBook Pro]], a guitar, a microphone, and [[Logic Pro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/clemens-rehbein|title=Clemens Rehbein Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref> Clemens Rehbein uses different guitars, including the [[Framus|Framus Mayfield Custom Electric]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://equipboard.com/pros/clemens-rehbein|title=Clemens Rehbein Equipboard|website=Equipboard|access-date=27 April 2019}}</ref>

As their career has progressed, Milky Chance have included [[Antonio Greger]] and Sebastian Schmidt as touring members.

Their second album, ''[[Blossom (Milky Chance album)|Blossom]]'', was recorded close to their hometown, in [[Rotenburg an der Fulda]]. This time the duo relied on real instruments instead of a digital setup, and produced it together with Tobias Kuhn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/de/Milky-Chance-Blossom/release/10022907|title=Milky Chance - Blossom|website=Discogs|language=de|access-date=2018-02-23}}</ref>
