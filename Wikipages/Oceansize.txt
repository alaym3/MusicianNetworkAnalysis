'''Oceansize''' were an English [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Manchester]], formed in 1998. The band consisted of Mike Vennart (vocals, guitar), Steve Durose (guitar, backing vocals), Richard "Gambler" Ingram (guitar, keyboards), Mark Heron (drums) and Jon Ellis (bass guitar) for the majority of its career, with Steve Hodson replacing Ellis on bass guitar in 2006.

The band released four studio albums, in addition to a number of minor EPs and singles, displaying a wide array of influences from several genres including [[post-rock]], [[math rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], and [[space rock]]. Following a twelve-year career, Oceansize announced their split in February 2011,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oceansize.co.uk/ |title=www.oceansize.co.uk |work=oceansize.co.uk |year=2011 |access-date=25 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070716141327/http://www.oceansize.co.uk/ |archive-date=16 July 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with the members moving on to different projects.

==History==

===Formation and early years (1998–2000)===
The band members met each other while attending music college in Salford, where the various members performed in a range of different musical acts very stylistically different from the band they would go on to create.<ref name="freewilliamsburg.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/july_2004/oceansize.html |title=Oceansize |website=Freewilliamsburg.com |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref> "[The bands were] pretty terrible," said Mike Vennart. "We were in a grunge band. When I met Steve I asked him to be the new guitarist. I wanted to be experimental and unusual and still write pop songs. We were terrible at it. We didn't go anywhere for a while. When we got a new rhythm section, we re-thought what we were doing and got better. We had more vision. Although we don't all like the same music and have different tastes, we can see clearly where our music needs the most work."

Though known as a Manchester band, Vennart, Gambler and Ellis are originally from [[Yorkshire, England|Yorkshire]], DuRose from [[Birmingham, England|Birmingham]], and Mark Heron is [[Scotland|Scottish]]. Steven Hodson, who joined the band later, is the only member of Oceansize to hail from the Manchester area.

The band subsequently named themselves after [[Jane's Addiction]] song, "Ocean Size". According to guitarist Gambler, the band's then-bassist Jon Ellis came up with the name: "I think, at the time, he was thinking what we would sound like. Jane's ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' album, which has the track "Ocean Size" on it, was definitely a big influence."<ref name="pennyblackmusic.co.uk">{{cite web|url=http://www.pennyblackmusic.co.uk/MagSitePages/Article.aspx?id=4478 |title=Oceansize : Interview |website=Pennyblackmusic.co.uk |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref>

===First EPs and ''Effloresce'' (2000–2005)===
Over the next few years, Oceansize would release two self-released EPs ''[[Amputee EP|Amputee]]'' and ''[[A Very Still Movement EP|A Very Still Movement]]''. This in turn led to interest from [[Beggars Banquet Records]], who signed the band in 2000. The band's first release on the label was the ''[[Relapse EP|Relapse]]'' EP titled after a very early composition that had been through many different reworkings.<ref name="freewilliamsburg.com"/> The EP was produced by [[Cardiacs]] leader [[Tim Smith (Cardiacs)|Tim Smith]], a long-time hero of the band.

Oceansize's debut album ''[[Effloresce (album)|Effloresce]]'' was released on 29 September 2003 on [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]]. The album spawned the singles "Catalyst", "One Day All This Could Be Yours" and "Remember Where You Are", each of which featured a music video. The album garnered considerable critical acclaim, with music critic Ben Hogwood stating that: "with their broad harmonic language and fluctuating rhythms it's difficult to give an alternative to Oceansize, which is always a good sign. If pushed I would say they've taken a good liking to '70s rock but taken on board the works of bands such as [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and [[The Cooper Temple Clause]], along with the more expansive end of Seattle grunge music.".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.musicomh.com/reviews/albums/oceansize-effloresce |title=Oceansize – Effloresce {{pipe}} album reviews |publisher=musicOMH.com |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref>

===''Everyone Into Position'' and line-up change (2005–2007)===
Two years later, the band released their second album, ''[[Everyone Into Position]]'' on 19 September 2005. The album track "Meredith" was featured on the popular television drama [[The O.C.]], and one of the album's singles, "Music For A Nurse", became the soundtrack to an [[Orange SA|Orange]] advertising campaign entitled ''Fish'' during summer 2006. "Music For A Nurse" was also featured in the motion picture ''The Invisible'' (2007), and both "Music For A Nurse" and "Meredith" have also been used in the BBC drama series ''[[Waterloo Road (TV series)|Waterloo Road]]''.

On the writing process for the record Vennart said "The writing process itself was interesting, we’d bought a computer and some mics and were making decent demos on our own, much to the delight of our record company. We started writing ‘onscreen’ for the first time ever. Songs like ‘Heaven Alive’ and ‘Meredith’ were pieced together. Steve worked up a 4-track demo for what became ‘Dirty Sweet Smell Of The Summer’. I brought in the chords for parts of ‘Charm Offensive’ and we designed it from scratch as the opening song. The whole album was, from my point of view, designed as the ideal festival headline set. We all went to Glastonbury every year and had some super-drugged up experience watching Radiohead or The Flaming Lips or Mogwai or Cardiacs or whoever. We, or rather i, wanted something that would work on that level. Yeah i know; i was smoking a lot of weed back then."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Untitled|url=https://mikevennart.tumblr.com/?og=1|access-date=2021-01-09|website=mikevennart.tumblr.com}}</ref>

Oceansize had mixed views on the album as a whole.<ref name="godisinthetvzine.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=2013&type=Interviews |title=God Is In The TV {{pipe}} Oceansize |publisher=Godisinthetvzine.co.uk |access-date=2011-04-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112173821/http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/content/content_detail.php?id=2013&type=Interviews |archive-date=12 January 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Despite the band's view on the record, critics and fans generally praised the release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subba-cultcha.com/article_album.php?id=399 |title=Subba-Cultcha |publisher=Subba-cultcha.com |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>  The lukewarm review the album received from [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] was the one that seemed to be the most consistent with the band's own thoughts on it. The review singled out the album's more progressive tracks such as "You Can't Keep a Bad Man Down" and "Ornament/The Last Wrongs" for praise while criticizing songs such as "Heaven Alive" for sticking too closely to alt rock conventions that the reviewer ultimately felt was holding the band back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/6122-everyone-into-position/ |title=Album Reviews: Oceansize: Everyone Into Position |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2006-02-23 |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref> Despite this, Mike Vennart has stated frequently that ''Everyone Into Position'' is his favourite Oceansize album.

Following the release of ''[[Everyone Into Position]]'', Oceansize subsequently left [[Beggars Banquet Records|Beggars Banquet]].<ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web|author=<!--lead container name-->The Size of things |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2007/10/01/011007_oceansize_feature.shtml |title=Manchester – Entertainment – The Size of things |publisher=BBC |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref> The band sought a new record deal that would better support the band in terms of promotion and financial backing for international touring. {{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Mike Vennart implied in a recent interview that the record deal was contingent on the band writing two tracks "on order" for the company.  These mp3s were released on the band's Myspace page around Christmas 2006 as a band-described gift to the fans. The two songs were "Red Rag to a Bear" and "Siberian Bullshit". In the posting of these mp3s, Vennart described these tracks as "warts an' all," and suggested that they would not show up on the new album.

On moving to new label, [[Superball Music]], Vennart described the move as a chance for the band to move forward: "we reached a point when we'd gone as far as we could [with Beggars Banquet]. We needed a new home and these guys offered it to us on a plate. We're the only band on the label at the moment, so they can't do enough for us."<ref name="godisinthetvzine.co.uk"/>

''Everyone Into Position'' marked the final appearance of bassist Jon Ellis. On 4 December 2005, the band issued a press release, stating that Ellis was leaving the band, but would still contribute musically. On 16 January 2006 frontman Mike Vennart issued a short post on an Oceansize messageboard announcing Ellis' replacement, Steve Hodson – a member of the Oceansize side-project Kong and also the drummer in Capulet.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

===''Frames'' and ''Home & Minor'' (2007–2009)===
The band's third album, ''[[Frames (Oceansize album)|Frames]]'', was released on 1 October 2007 on [[Superball Music]]. Artwork for the album was provided by [[Robin Finck]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[Guns N' Roses]].<ref name="pennyblackmusic.co.uk"/> Originally entitled ''The Frame'', the band elected to alter the name slightly after an incidental suggestion; Vennart explained that "one of our friends, who's in [[Future of the Left]], said 'I love the title... ''Frames'', isn't it?' We just thought, 'well it wasn't, but that's a lot better. It's an angular title, it evokes strength and structure and it's quite cinematic."<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> The album was trailed as featuring "a lot of songs about grudges and negative energy",<ref name="godisinthetvzine.co.uk"/> with the song "Commemorative 9/11 T-Shirt", inspired by a gift to Vennart by band [[Cardiacs]], which includes a time signature of "11/8 or 9/8, so when we were naming the song it was like 'it's in 11, it's in 9, it's got to be 9/11".<ref name="godisinthetvzine.co.uk"/>

In May and June 2009, Oceansize supported Sydney band [[Cog (band)|Cog]] on a national tour of [[Australia]], along with other support act [[Calling All Cars (band)|Calling All Cars]], playing a string of dates which included shows in capital cities [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Adelaide]] & [[Brisbane]]. Of the tour, Mike Vennart spoke of the excitement, saying "from the moment (the tour) was mentioned, I was just hammering our manager, going 'make it happen!'"<ref name="fasterlouder.com.au">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404054949/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/18521/Oceansize.htm |title=Oceansize on |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=2009-05-20 |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref>

On the 1 August 2009, the band played the [[Sonisphere]] festival at [[Knebworth]], joining [[Linkin Park]], [[Metallica]], [[Nine Inch Nails]], [[Alice in Chains]] and more for the weekend festival.

===''Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up'' (2009–2010)===
The band started working on their fourth (and ultimately final) album, ''[[Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up]]'' in fall 2009. In January 2010, the band embarked upon a UK tour, showcasing new material According to Mike Vennart's [[Twitter]], the recording of the album was completed on 17 April, with Vennart stating "Recording is complete! Album 4 is go! It's all on [[Chris Sheldon]] now". Mastering was completed at [[Abbey Road Studios]] on 18 May 2010 by Sean Magee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/RealOceanSize |title=Oceansize (RealOceansize) on Twitter |website=Twitter.com |access-date=2011-04-03}}</ref> On 22 July 2010, Oceansize posted one of the album's songs, "SuperImposer", on their Superball website,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.superballmusic.com/specials/oceansize |title=Oceansize – Self Preserved While The Bodies Float Up |website=Superballmusic.com |access-date=2011-04-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100725003308/http://www.superballmusic.com/specials/oceansize/ |archive-date=25 July 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and made it available for download via Twitter and Facebook.

''[[Self Preserved While the Bodies Float Up]]'' was released on 6 September 2010. The album showcased a heavier side to the band, who stated that it probably was their heaviest studio album to date. However, Vennart claimed that the album still had the diversity found on other Oceansize albums. The band subsequently toured to promote the release.

===Band break-up ===
On 25 February 2011, Oceansize announced via the band's Twitter and Facebook pages that they had split up. No explanations were provided. In an interview a year later in 2012, Vennart commented "It's tricky. I'd kind of like to tell the story but it's pretty dramatic. It would alter the sound of the records that we spent ages dreaming up, and to some people it might sound all a little petty. But it was so fucking ugly. Suffice to say it was a recurring problem that grew and grew and it couldn't be ignored or tolerated anymore."<ref name=lobffeb2012>[https://archive.today/20120914134721/http://www.thelineofbestfit.com/2012/03/introducing-british-theatre/ Introducing British Theatre] – article by Josh Hall in ''The Line of Best Fit'', 19 March 2012</ref> On 31 May 2013 Vennart finally put an end to most speculation via a post on Twitter, stating that after a disastrous band performance at a concert in Warsaw on 23 October 2010, Gambler had quit Oceansize and that this had broken up the band.<ref name="twitter.com">{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/Hhaitch/status/340556269960175616 |title=Mike Vennart 🔺🔺🔻 @VennartMike on Twitter: "@MinusTheFire For the record, following that pitiful display in Warsaw, Gambler quit the band. That is how it ended. There. Done." |website=Twitter.com |date=2013-05-31 |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> In reply to a fan who tweeted a video of the performance, in which Mark Heron's drumming seems considerably affected, Vennart commented: "Stay off them drugs, kids".<ref name="twitter.com"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_4XVdiycfE |title=Oceansize - Silent/Transparent (live in Warszawa) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref>

While Vennart refused to blame any individuals in particular, he had previously said (in a May 2012 interview with the music blog ''Undersong'') that persistent drug abuse by at least one band member had undermined Oceansize and led to the circumstances surrounding the split: "Whilst Oceansize had no delusions of grandeur, there were those in the band that just weren't up to the job. Put it like this, when you watch [[Biffy Clyro]] live you can rest assured that they are pretty much stone-cold sober. They're certainly not drunk, stoned, on downers or tripping their tits off ... They're easy to play for cos they know how to play the songs and they play them correctly every single night. There's an inherent trust there. There's also a respect for their audience – they understand that their fans may have travelled miles, saved up money for tickets, planned their life around a show. It's this respect for each other and their audience that has stood Biffy in good stead and it has helped take them to the top. That mindset has to be in place before you even consider a setlist. This respect and these qualities were, I'm sad to say, not consistent in the ranks of Oceansize. Even if the opportunity had ever presented itself, Oceansize simply was not allowed to move forward. Whenever we had to step up to the challenge, the same fucking turd was on the doorstep."<ref>[http://undersong.co.uk/2012/05/interview-mike-vennart/ 'Interview: Mike Vennart'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927105728/http://undersong.co.uk/2012/05/interview-mike-vennart/ |date=27 September 2013 }} in 'UnderSong' music blog, May 2012</ref>

While Vennart has pointed to Heron's Warsaw performance as the primary impetus, Gambler also pointed to the end of a long-term relationship as a factor in his decision to quit the band. Gambler does not rule out a reunion in the future, though he does not believe it will happen any time soon.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Vennart stated on Twitter in 2020 about the prospect of a reunion: "With every passing year, the inclination fades, the proposed fee grows. It'll never be enough."<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=Vennart |number=1340393230119170050 |date = 19 December 2020 |title=That's a question I've not been asked in a while.

Believe it or not, I'm a romantic kind of guy and I love the idea of a reunion show just like you do. But fuck, it would be tough."<ref>{{Cite tweet |user=Vennart |number=1340398127489183745|date = 19 December 2020 |title= It's fine, it doesn't bug me like it used to. It's been a very long time. Believe it or not, I'm a romantic kind of guy and I love the idea of a reunion show just like you do. But fuck, it would be tough.}}</ref>

==Post-Oceansize==
Following the breakup of Oceansize, various members went on to other work or continued with side projects which they had begun prior to the split. Gambler (under his real name of Richard A. Ingram) had already begun a solo career in parallel to Oceansize,  while Steve Hodson and Mark Heron continued with Kong (and Hodson continued his ongoing solo work as Mild Eyes). In 2011, both Mike Vennart and Steve Durose took on work as touring guitarists for other bands – Vennart with [[Biffy Clyro]] and Durose with [[Amplifier (band)|Amplifier]].

Further post-Oceansize projects emerged quickly after the breakup. Steve Hodson worked with the band Chandelier Swing<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.music-dash.co.uk/releases/printarchive.asp?item=6998 |title=Archived copy |access-date=12 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021195607/http://www.music-dash.co.uk/releases/printarchive.asp?item=6998 |archive-date=21 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> while Mark Heron worked with improv band Shamefaced<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shamefaced.bandcamp.com/album/unlimited-shamefaced-company |title=Unlimited Shamefaced Company {{pipe}} shamefaced |website=Shamefaced.bandcamp.com |access-date=2020-03-02}}</ref> and released new music under his Kong alias of "Krem". Mike Vennart and Gambler reunited in the duo [[British Theatre (band)|British Theatre]], who released their debut EP via Bandcamp in February 2012. <ref>[http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/features/british-theatre-id-had-it-with-the-darkness/ "British Theatre: I'd had it with the darkness"] – article by Alex Lynham in Fake DIY, 25 February 2012</ref> Vennart has released three solo albums, ''The Demon Joke'' (2015), ''To Cure a Blizzard Upon a Plastic Sea'' (2018) and ''In the Dead, Dead Wood'' (2020).

==Style, influences and creative process==
Oceansize described eclectic sources of inspiration. Gambler has attested that everyone in the band had "such diverse influences. I think it would be a list a mile long. The obvious ones, especially for me, would be Radiohead, Mogwai, Aphex Twin, Nine Inch Nails and Tool; I think I could probably go on all day. I mean if you looked at our record collection you probably wouldn't think it."<ref name="pennyblackmusic.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web|access-date=24 April 2020|url=http://thesilentballet.com/reviews/Interview__Oceansize.html|first=Mohammed |last=Ashraf|website=Thesilentballet.com|title=Interview: Oceansize |date=2010}}</ref>

Associates of UK groups such as [[Amplifier (band)|Amplifier]], [[Biffy Clyro]] and [[Aereogramme]], earlier in their career, Oceansize were also frequently grouped in with the [[space rock]] movement that had gained some underground popularity at the time - essentially heavy alternative rock with [[shoegaze]] leanings. One of the band's earliest major tours was with [[Cave In]] from Massachusetts, U.S., who they were frequently compared to especially in their earlier years.

Oceansize often stated that the bulk of their writing was the product of fruitful [[jam session]]s, with Steve Durose saying after the release of ''Effloresce'' that "our sound has just evolved really, but right from the first rehearsal, we kind of had it in the bag. We were on mushrooms and just jammed for ages, and then we listened back to the tapes. About three songs from Effloresce were born in that one rehearsal, and we just realized we had something special happening. Everything comes from jams, though. That's the way we write." In regards to structure and time signature, Durose cites drummer Mark Heron as a key collaborator; "Mark's very into strange beats, so what will start off as a very simple idea, once it's been through the Oceansize washing machine will come out as something sounding quite bizarre at the other end." Gambler has advocated a 'no strings' approach with the creative process, saying that "I think we have been tied into the whole progressive thing for quite a bit now. When we formed the band we didn't think we were going to be this or that sort of band. We're forward thinking as far as our music is concerned".<ref name="pennyblackmusic.co.uk"/>

In 2020, Vennart, along with [[Kavus Torabi]], collaborated with [[Rob Crow]] on ''An EP of Acoustic [[Iron Maiden]] Covers'', which featured a cover of the instrumental "Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)" from ''[[Powerslave]]'' (1984), as well as a reenactment of "[[2_Minutes_to_Midnight#"Mission_From_'Arry"|Mission From 'Arry]]", a recording of an actual argument between [[Steve Harris (musician)|Steve Harris]], [[Nicko McBrain]] and [[Bruce Dickinson]]. Vennart played Harris, with Torabi playing McBrain and Crow playing Dickinson.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://robcrow.bandcamp.com/album/blm-eps|title=BLM EPs|website=robcrow.bandcamp.com}}</ref>
