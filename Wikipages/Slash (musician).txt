== Career ==

=== 1981–1985: Early years ===

Slash joined his first band, Tidus Sloan, in 1981.<ref name="HTGTH" /> In 1983, he formed the band [[Road Crew (band)|Road Crew]]—named after the [[Motörhead]] song "[[Ace of Spades (album)|(We Are) The Road Crew]]"—with his childhood friend [[Steven Adler]], who by then had learned to play drums. He placed an advertisement in a newspaper looking for a bassist, and received a response from [[Duff McKagan]]. They auditioned a number of singers, including one-time [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]] vocalist [[Ron Reyes]], and worked on material that included the main riff of what became the [[Guns N' Roses]] song "[[Rocket Queen]]".<ref name="Slash 2008 87">{{harvnb|Slash|Bozza|2008|p=87}}</ref> Slash disbanded the group the following year due to them not being able to find a singer, as well as Adler's lack of work ethic compared to himself and McKagan.<ref name="Slash 2008 87" /> He, along with Adler, then joined a local band known as [[Hollywood Rose]], which featured singer [[Axl Rose]] and guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]]. Following his time with Hollywood Rose, Slash played in a band called Black Sheep and unsuccessfully auditioned for [[Poison (American band)|Poison]], a [[glam metal]] band that he later openly derided.<ref name="HTGTH" />

The following September, [[Guns N' Roses]] released the long-awaited albums ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II]]'', which debuted at No. 2 and No. 1, respectively, on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. chart]], a feat not achieved by any other group.<ref name="Sugerman91">{{cite book |last=Sugerman |first=Danny |title=Appetite for Destruction: The Days of Guns N' Roses |url=https://archive.org/details/appetitefordestr00suge_0 |url-access=registration |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-312-07634-7}}</ref> Izzy Stradlin abruptly left the band in November; he was replaced by [[Gilby Clarke]] of [[Candy (band)|Candy]] and Kill for Thrills. Slash finished Use Your Illusion Tour with Guns N' Roses on July 17, 1993.<ref name="HTGTH" /> In November of that year, the band released ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]'', a cover album of mostly [[punk rock|punk]] songs, which proved less successful than its predecessors. Slash then wrote several songs for what would have become the follow-up album to the ''Use Your Illusion'' double album. Axl Rose and Duff, however, rejected the material.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rose, W.

=== 1994–2002: Slash's Snakepit ===
{{Main|Slash's Snakepit}}
In 1994, Slash formed Slash's Snakepit, a side project that featured his Guns N' Roses bandmates [[Matt Sorum]] and Gilby Clarke on drums and rhythm guitar respectively, as well as [[Alice in Chains]]' [[Mike Inez]] on bass and [[Jellyfish (band)|Jellyfish]]'s [[Eric Dover]] on vocals. The band recorded Slash's material originally intended for Guns N' Roses, resulting in the release of ''[[It's Five O'Clock Somewhere (album)|It's Five O'Clock Somewhere]]'' in February 1995. The album was critically praised for ignoring the then-popular conventions of [[alternative music]], and fared well on the charts, eventually selling over one million copies in the US alone despite little promotion from Geffen Records. Slash's Snakepit toured in support of the album with bassist [[James LoMenzo]] and drummer [[Brian Tichy]] of [[Pride & Glory (band)|Pride & Glory]], before disbanding in 1996. Slash then toured for two years with the [[blues rock]] cover band [[Slash's Blues Ball]].

In 1999, Slash chose to regroup Slash's Snakepit with [[Rod Jackson (musician)|Rod Jackson]] on vocals, [[Ryan Roxie]] on rhythm guitar, Johnny Griparic on bass, and [[Matt Laug]] on drums. Their second album, ''[[Ain't Life Grand (Slash's Snakepit album)|Ain't Life Grand]]'', was released in October 2000 through [[E1 Music|Koch Records]]. It did not sell as well as the band's previous release, and its critical reception was mixed. To promote the album, the band—with [[Keri Kelli]] on rhythm guitar—embarked on an extensive world tour in support of [[AC/DC]] in the summer of 2000, followed by their own headlining theater tour. Slash disbanded Snakepit in 2002.

=== 2002–2008: Velvet Revolver ===
{{Main|Velvet Revolver}}
[[File:Velvet Revolver live in London 5 June 2007 03.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Slash and [[Scott Weiland]] during a [[Velvet Revolver]] concert in [[London]] in 2007]]
In 2002, Slash reunited with [[Duff McKagan]] and [[Matt Sorum]] for a [[Randy Castillo]] tribute concert. Realizing that they still had the chemistry of their days in Guns N' Roses, they decided to form a new band together. Former Guns N' Roses guitarist [[Izzy Stradlin]] was initially involved, but left after the others decided to find a lead singer. [[Dave Kushner]], who had previously played with McKagan in [[Loaded (band)|Loaded]], then joined the band on rhythm guitar. For many months, the four searched for a lead singer by listening to offered demo tapes, a monotonous process documented by [[VH1]]. Eventually, former [[Stone Temple Pilots]] vocalist [[Scott Weiland]] joined the band.

In 2003, Velvet Revolver played several concerts during the summer and released their first single, "[[Set Me Free (Velvet Revolver song)|Set Me Free]]". In June 2004, they released their debut album, ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]'', which debuted at No.{{nbsp}}1 on the U.S. chart and sold two million copies, re-establishing Slash as a mainstream performer. A year-and-a-half-long tour followed in support of the album. In 2005, the band was nominated for three Grammys: Rock Album of the Year, Rock Song, and Hard Rock Performance for their ''Contraband'' single "[[Slither (song)|Slither]]" which won their first and only Grammy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/velvet-revolver|title=Velvet Revolver|date=2019-02-15|website=GRAMMY.com|language=en|access-date=2019-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190216171449/https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/velvet-revolver|archive-date=February 16, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> In July 2007, Velvet Revolver released their second album, ''[[Libertad (Velvet Revolver album)|Libertad]]'', and embarked on a second tour.

Since 1997, Slash has collaborated with Gibson on [[Gibson Les Paul#Slash|seventeen signature Les Paul models]]{{nsmdns}}five through Gibson USA; seven through the Gibson Custom Shop; and five through the Gibson subsidiary [[Epiphone]]. Slash also plays various other Gibson guitars, including [[Gibson Firebird|Firebirds]] and [[Gibson Explorer|Explorers]].  In addition to Gibson, he also plays or has played guitars by a plethora of other brands as well, including [[B.C. Rich]] with whom he has designed several custom models based on their [[B.C. Rich Mockingbird|Mockingbird]] and [[Bich 10|Bich]] designs.  He has used guitars by [[Fender Guitars|Fender]], [[Gretsch]], [[Jackson Guitars|Jackson]], and [[Martin Guitars|Martin]].  He has also collaborated on signature equipment with other companies. In 1996, Marshall introduced the Marshall Slash Signature JCM{{nbsp}}2555, an authentic reissue of the Marshall "Silver Jubilee" JCM{{nbsp}}2555 released in 1987. It was the first signature amp ever produced by Marshall, with production limited to 3000.<ref name="marshallsignature">{{cite web |title=Marshall Slash Signature JCM 2555 on SlashParadise |publisher=www.slashparadise.com |date=January 1, 2010 |url=http://www.slashparadise.com/equipment/marshall-jcm2555-slash-signature.php |access-date=April 30, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418163731/http://www.slashparadise.com/equipment/marshall-jcm2555-slash-signature.php |archive-date=April 18, 2012}}</ref> In 2007, [[Dunlop Manufacturing|Jim Dunlop]] introduced the [[Dunlop Cry Baby|Crybaby]] SW-95 Slash Signature Wah, designed after Slash's own custom-built Crybaby wah pedal.<ref name="dunlopsignature">{{cite journal |last=Gill |first=Chris |title=Dunlop Crybaby SW-95 Slash Wah |date=July 19, 2007 |journal=Guitar World |publisher=Future US, Inc. |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/article/dunlop_cry_baby_sw_95_slash_wah |access-date=April 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508035304/http://www.guitarworld.com/article/dunlop_cry_baby_sw_95_slash_wah|archive-date=May 8, 2011}}</ref> In 2010, [[Seymour Duncan]] introduced the Alnico II Pro Slash APH-2 pickups, which were designed to recreate the tone of Slash's main studio guitar.<ref name="seymoursignature">{{cite web |title=Seymour Duncan Alnico II Pro Slash APH-2 |publisher=SeymourDuncan.com |url=http://www.seymourduncan.com/products/electric/humbucker/alnico_ii_pro_s_1/ |access-date=April 30, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114032354/http://www.seymourduncan.com/products/electric/humbucker/alnico_ii_pro_s_1|archive-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref> The Slash signature pickups were marketed through Seymour Duncan's YouTube channel with product demonstrator Danny Young performing the official videos.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/demo-videos-seymour-duncan-alnico-ii-pro-slash-signature-pickups|title=Demo Videos: Seymour Duncan Alnico II Pro Slash Signature Pickups|work=Guitar World|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-us|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325171433/https://www.guitarworld.com/gear/demo-videos-seymour-duncan-alnico-ii-pro-slash-signature-pickups|archive-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.seymourduncan.com/artist/daniel-young|title=Daniel Young|work=Seymour Duncan|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180325232314/https://www.seymourduncan.com/artist/daniel-young|archive-date=March 25, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Seymour Duncan|title=Alnico II Pro Slash (Neck)|date=2013-08-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIHnP5xtz5s|access-date=2018-03-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321233506/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gIHnP5xtz5s|archive-date=March 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Seymour Duncan|title=Slash Bridge Pickup Demo (Hard Rock)|date=2013-09-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8D3NIjcTxk|access-date=2018-03-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923195015/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8D3NIjcTxk|archive-date=September 23, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|last=Seymour Duncan|title=Slash Bridge Pickup Demo (Classic Rock Version)|date=2014-02-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr5lJtoY5Fo|access-date=2018-03-25|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140321233505/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hr5lJtoY5Fo|archive-date=March 21, 2014}}</ref> Also in 2010, Marshall introduced the Marshall AFD100, a recreation of the Marshall 1959 that Slash used for the recording of ''Appetite for Destruction'', with production limited to 2300.<ref name="Marshallafd">{{cite web |title=Marshall AFD100 |publisher=AFD100.com |url=http://www.afd100.com/the-afd-story/ |access-date=April 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228022110/http://www.afd100.com/the-afd-story/ |archive-date=December 28, 2012}}</ref>

On stage, Slash prefers [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] amplifiers, particularly the Marshall "Silver Jubilee" JCM{{nbsp}}2555 amp. He used a rented early-1970s [[Marshall 1959]] for the recording of ''Appetite for Destruction''.<ref name="Slashsworld">{{cite web |last=Rymas |first=J.R. |title=Sweet Marshall o' Mine Part 2: The Breakthrough – Case Closed! |publisher=SlashsWorld.com |url=http://www.slashsworld.com/equipment/amps/the-appetite-amp-story/sweet-marshall-o%E2%80%99-mine-part-2-the-breakthrough-case-closed/ |access-date=April 22, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120530075453/http://www.slashsworld.com/equipment/amps/the-appetite-amp-story/sweet-marshall-o%E2%80%99-mine-part-2-the-breakthrough-case-closed/ |archive-date=May 30, 2012  }}</ref> Slash enjoyed the amp so much that he tried to keep it, telling the rental company, S.I.R., that it had been stolen. However, the amp was repossessed by S.I.R. employees after a roadie accidentally brought it to rehearsals at the store.<ref name="Slashsworld" /> For the recording of Velvet Revolver's debut album, ''[[Contraband (Velvet Revolver album)|Contraband]]'', he used a [[Vox AC30]] amp and small [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] tube amps, and on their second album, ''[[Libertad (Velvet Revolver album)|Libertad]]'', he used the Marshall "Vintage Modern" 2466 amp. On his [[Slash (album)|eponymous debut solo album]] he used a Marshall JCM{{nbsp}}800, issued as "#34", and later, on the subsequent world tour, Slash used his signature Marshall AFD100 amp.
