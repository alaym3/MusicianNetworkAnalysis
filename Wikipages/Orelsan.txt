Orelsan's artistry and rapping technique has drawn him comparisons to American rap legend [[Eminem]] on several occasions, primarily because both are prominent [[White people|white]] rappers and both are known for their ability to switch between or combine violent and comical rapping techniques.<ref name="Orelsan-Eminem 1">{{cite web |url=http://blog.solidarite-sida.org/orelsan-un-eminem-made-in-france-8135 |author=Subli |title=Orelsan, un Eminem made in France ? |publisher=blog.solidarite-sida.org |date=4 June 2012 |access-date=23 March 2014 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323202351/http://blog.solidarite-sida.org/orelsan-un-eminem-made-in-france-8135 |archive-date=23 March 2014 }}</ref><ref name="Orelsan-Eminem 2">{{cite web |url=https://www.france-amerique.com/articles/2009/04/23/orelsan-durant-le-french-bashing-je-vivais-a-tampa-bay-en-floride.html |author=Akeem Kossoko |title=Orelsan, le " Eminem d'Alençon " au cœur d'une polémique en France |publisher=France-Amérique.com |date=23 April 2009 |access-date=23 March 2014 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226195954/http://www.france-amerique.com/articles/2009/04/23/orelsan-durant-le-french-bashing-je-vivais-a-tampa-bay-en-floride.html |archive-date=26 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="Orelsan-Eminem 3">{{cite web |url=http://www.plume-egaree.com/2012/12/orelsan-eminem-rap-francais.html |title=Orelsan : le Eminem du rap français |publisher=Plume-Égarée.com |date=17 December 2012 |access-date=23 March 2014 |language=fr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323195424/http://www.plume-egaree.com/2012/12/orelsan-eminem-rap-francais.html |archive-date=23 March 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

==Life and career==

===1982–2003: Early life and beginnings===
Aurélien Cotentin was born on 1 August 1982 in [[Alençon]] in [[Lower Normandy]], where he was raised by his father, a middle school principal, and his mother, a teacher. He initially listened to rock music and was also a fan of [[manga]] and [[comics]]. While practicing [[basketball]], he picked up the love of rap through his basketball friends.<ref name="lib">{{cite news|url=http://www.liberation.fr/culture/0101319939-orelsan-le-rap-a-plat|author=Stéphanie Binet|title=Orelsan, le rap à plat|newspaper=[[Libération]]|date=17 February 2009|access-date=21 March 2012}} (in French)</ref> He graduated with a French [[baccalauréat]] in Economic and Social Sciences before moving to [[Caen]] where he studied at l'[[École de management de Normandie|École de Management de Normandie]], graduating in 2004. While in college, he made friends with record producer [[Skread]], who had worked with [[Diam's]], [[Booba]], [[Rohff]] and [[Nessbeal]]. He also collaborated with [[Gringe]] in his initial works and formed the duo [[Casseurs Flowters]] with him in 2004.

Orelsan spent one year at the [[University of Tampa]] in [[Florida]], where he had the inspiration of writing the song "50 pour cent". In 2002, he issued a mixtape and was invited to contribute in various compilations. Returning to France and working the night shifts in a hotel gave him the opportunity to write more.

===2004–2010: Early career and ''Perdu d'avance''===
[[File:Orelsan.jpg|thumb|right|Orelsan in 2009.]]
In 2004, Orelsan formed the hip hop duo [[Casseurs Flowters]] with his colleague [[Gringe]]. With help from French record producer [[Skread]], they released their first [[mixtape]] ''Fantasy: Episode 1'' in 2004 with 11 tracks.<ref name=charts1>[http://www.chartsinfrance.net/Orelsan/news-85758.html Charts in France: Orelsan : un nouvel album des Casseurs Flowters avec Gringe!] {{in lang|fr}}</ref> Afterwards, the two decided to focus on building their solo careers.

In August 2006, Orelsan released his first clip on [[YouTube]], called "Ramen", followed by a second one in 2007, called "Saint-Valentin", a sarcastic parody on [[Valentine's Day]] that attracted great following prompting him to release more of his work online through YouTube and [[Myspace]].

In 2008, the record label 3<sup>e</sup> Bureau noticed his work and offered him an opportunity to produce an album in collaboration with [[7th Magnitude]], a record label founded by Skread and his colleague Ablaye. In the summer of 2008, he promoted the release of "[[Changement]]", his first [[Single (music)|single]] released on 13 October 2008, and its music video through the [[TF1]] Video and [[Nolife (TV channel)|Nolife]] TV channels. The video was Orelsan's first professionally prepared clip.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIIyA3DAQXo]</ref>

On 16 February 2009, Orelsan released his debut album ''[[Perdu d'avance]]'', a provocative album produced by Skread, that included 14 tracks. With "Changement" as its [[lead single]], it included tracks such as the title track "Perdu d'avance", "50 pour cent", "Soirée ratée", "Différent" and "No-life", with music video releases for all. "Entre bien et mal" featured his [[Casseurs Flowters]] colleague [[Gringe]] and "La peur de l'échec" featured [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Ron "Bumblefoot" Thal]]. At the end of 2009, Orelsan was nominated for the [[Prix Constantin]] award,<ref name="Prix Constantin 1">{{cite web|url=http://blog.formations-musique.com/20091114gagnant-et-selection-du-prix-constantin-2009/ |author=Gilles Rettel |title=Gagnant et sélection du Prix Constantin 2009 |publisher=Le blog de formations-musique.com |date=14 November 2009 |access-date=24 March 2014|language=fr}}</ref><ref name="Prix Constantin 2">{{cite web|url=http://musique.jeuxactu.com/news-prix-constantin-2009-la-liste-des-nomines-124.htm |title=Prix Constantin 2009 : La liste des nominés |publisher=MusiqueMag.com |access-date=24 March 2014|language=fr}}</ref> and won the [[MTV Europe Music Awards|MTV Europe Music Award]] for [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best French Act|Best French Act]], pipping highly favoured [[David Guetta]] to the prize.<ref name="MTVEMA-1">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.fr/emissions/mtv-ema/episodes/mtv-europe-music-awards-2009/video/mtv-europe-music-awards-2009-china-remet-son-prix-a-orelsan-453741/ |title=China remet le prix du Meilleur artiste français à Orelsan, en direct du plateau de MTV France |publisher=[[MTV France]] |access-date=24 March 2014|language=fr}}</ref><ref name="MTVEMA-2">{{cite web|url=http://www.programme-tv.net/news/tv/6889-mtv-awards-orelsan-bat-dabid-guetta/ |title=MTV Awards : Orelsan bat David Guetta ! |author=Julien Thomas |publisher=Télé-Loisirs.fr |date=14 October 2009 |access-date=24 March 2014|language=fr}}</ref><ref name="MTVEMA-3">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.fr/news/orelsan-est-le-meilleur-artiste-francais/|title=Orelsan est le meilleur artiste français - Notre vainqueur aux MTV Europe Music Awards 2009|publisher=[[MTV]]|date=11 October 2009|access-date=22 March 2012|language=fr}}</ref>

==Controversy==
===Printemps de Bourges===
In 2009, controversy erupted involving some of Orelsan's work that included violent and [[Misogyny|misogynist]] lyrics, particularly in "Saint-Valentin" and "Sale pute" (the latter is [[French language|French]] for "Dirty whore"). Neither song appeared on his debut album ''[[Perdu d'avance]]'', but were made available online. Many blog campaigns followed, demanding that he be banned from appearing at a scheduled gig at the [[Printemps de Bourges]] festival.<ref name="Polémique">{{cite web|url=http://www.lexpress.fr/culture/musique/la-polemique-enfle-contre-le-rappeur-orelsan_749668.html |title=La polémique enfle contre le rappeur OrelSan |publisher=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |date=26 March 2009 |access-date=26 March 2014|language=fr}}</ref> The campaign took a political turn with both the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF) and the [[Socialist Party (France)|French Socialist Party]] (PS) supporting the campaign. The Socialist Party claimed in a communiqué that the song included "a scandalous, odious text that incited violence directly". It also supported the campaign to remove Orelsan from Printemps de Bourges. French Secretary of State for Solidarity [[Valérie Létard]] considered "Sale pute" sexist and violent and demanded that websites remove the video from their sites. She also offered help to groupings that wanted to file a lawsuit based on Article 24 of the law on freedom of the press, that forbids incitement to commit crimes.

[[File:Orelsan aux Nuits Secrètes 2013.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Orelsan (middle) performing at the Nuits Secrètes Festival at [[Aulnoye-Aymeries]], [[France]] on 4 August 2013.]]
Orelsan was taken aback by the controversy, mentioning that the song existed for 2 years explaining in an interview with ''Planète Rap Mag'': "In this song, I try to show how an impulsive drive can turn someone into a monster. I shot a clip where I am wearing a suit and tie and am drinking alcohol, to show that this is a fiction. In any case, I do apologize for the violence. The attitude of this character disgusts me, but I feel I am artistically representing the incident as hatred exactly as a film like ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' does. [...] In the storyline, I have actually been deceived by my girlfriend, and I wanted to describe the impulse of rage that you can have in such times. This is not a misogynist text on the contrary." He added: "I admit that these lyrics [can] shock" and he apologized about it mentioning that he had not performed the song live for several months and is not available on his album ''Perdu d'avance''. He added: "[However] whatever I said, I will always be less violent than the series broadcast on [[TF1]], where a guy gets hit every five minutes for no reason."

The Printemps de Bourges organisers insisted on keeping Orelsan on the show scheduled for 25 April 2009, saying in a communique: "As outrageous as are the lyrics of this song, we have hired Orelsan as a young artist for an artistic performance noting that his album does not include this [particular] song. For this reason, we do not remove [the date for] Orelsan's performance as we are fulfilling our artistic choices. This French language hip hop album presents good texts that seem a perfect reflection of a 20-year-old French generation, a bit lost and disillusioned." Despite explanations, [[François Bonneau]], the [[President of the Regional Council (France)|President of the Regional Council]] of the [[Centre (French region)|Centre]], threatened financial reprisals against the festival if it didn't reconsider its decision. It also deducted a proportional part of its subvention to the festival. Orelsan did eventually appear in the festival despite the campaign.<ref name="20m">{{cite news|url=http://www.20minutes.fr/article/314983/Culture-Orelsan-se-defend-face-aux-critiques.php|author=Alice Antheaume|title=Le rappeur de Caen est programmé au Printemps de Bourges.

The Printemps de Bourges controversy had repercussions elsewhere. When [[Les Francofolies de La Rochelle]] festival decided to ban Orelsan from performing,<ref name="rue">{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2009/07/15/orelsan-la-controverse-court-toujours-malgre-les-precedents|author=Chloé Leprince|title=Orelsan : la controverse court toujours... malgré les précédents|publisher=Rue89|access-date=21 March 2012}} (in French)</ref> he protested the intervention, citing censorship on artistic works.<ref name="rue2">{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2009/07/14/prive-de-francos-orelsan-veut-rencontrer-frederic-mitterrand|author=Pierre Siankowski|title=Privé de Francos, Orelsan veut rencontrer Frédéric Mitterrand|publisher=Rue89|access-date=21 March 2012}} (in French)</ref> The singer [[Cali (singer)|Cali]] protested to the organizers including Jean-Louis Foulquier, who had in turn accused [[Ségolène Royal]] of threats to stop the financial support.

[[Frédéric Lefebvre]], the spokesman for [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP) said that the matter was blown out of proportion declaring that he supported the young artist's freedom of expression and denounced attempts of censorship by Ségolène Royal against him.<ref name="ump">{{cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/flash-actualite-politique/l-ump-proteste-contre-la-deprogrammation-d-orelsan-et-s-en-prend-a-royal-12-07-2009-578216.php|author=AFP|title=L'UMP proteste contre la déprogrammation d'Orelsan et s'en prend à Royal|newspaper=[[Le Parisien]]|date=12 July 2009|access-date=22 March 2012}} (in French)</ref> Royal denied any "chantage" or threats, expressing her satisfaction that the organizers had decided to cancel Orelsan's gig. On 14 July 2009, French Minister of Culture [[Frédéric Mitterrand]] made a declaration of support for the rapper for freedom of expression, judging the whole controversy ridiculous. Many artists also came to Orelsan's support. Many French radio stations have censored at times Orelsan's songs due to protests from feminists and others,<ref name="guardian">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/mar/30/orelsan-rapper-french-women-misogynist|author=Deborah Finding|title=French rapper Orelsan's onslaught on women prompts outrage|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=31 March 2009|access-date=21 March 2012}}</ref> and the media have dubbed him the "Eminem of French rap".<ref name="Orelsan-Eminem 1" /><ref name="Orelsan-Eminem 2" /><ref name="Orelsan-Eminem 3" />

Orelsan explained the lyrics of "Sale pute" to [[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] as the expression of these mixed feelings between love and hatred,<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ahbV-7zW4w]</ref> and eventually dropped the song from his repertoire.<ref name="telegraph">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/5077310/French-Eminem-apologises-for-violent-rap.html|author=Henry Samuel|title="French Eminem" apologises for "violent" rap''|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 March 2009|access-date=21 March 2011}}</ref>

===Legal issues===
The gay French magazine ''[[Têtu]]'' has publicly questioned some of Orelsan's lyrics as being [[Homophobia|homophobic]]. In June 2012, at the Sakifo Festival in [[Réunion]], the regional council of the island suppressed its subvention of [[Euro|€]]150,000 or one tenth of the budget of the festival. The arrival of Orelsan was questioned, but finally the organisers went on with it, but took to pay back 1 euro for every ticket sold for the date of the show to associations that protested. The song that caused the most controversy was "Saint-Valentin".<ref>"Clicanoo",16 mars 2012</ref>

On 31 May 2013, Orelsan was given a suspended fine of €1,000 for insult and incitement of violence against women by the Correctional Tribunal of Paris.<ref>http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2013/05/31/le-rappeur-orelsan-condamne-pour-injure-et-provocation-a-la-violence_3421847_3246.html, ''Le Monde'', 31 mai 2013. {{in lang|fr}}</ref> On 14 May 2014, the [[Court of Appeal of Paris]] closed the case by putting an end to lawsuits and an original complaint filed against Orelsan, finding that action taken against him by five feminist associations was [[Statute of limitations|prescribed]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfmtv.com/societe/plainte-contre-orelsan-jugee-prescrite-appel-774203.html |title=Orelsan n'est plus poursuivi |language=fr |date=14 May 2014 |publisher=[[BFM TV]] |access-date=6 February 2015}}</ref>
