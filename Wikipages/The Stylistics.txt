'''The Stylistics''' are an American, [[Philadelphia soul]] group that achieved their greatest chart success in the 1970s. They formed in 1968, with a lineup of singers [[Russell Thompkins Jr.]], Herb Murrell, Airrion Love, James Smith and James Dunn. All of their US hits were ballads characterized by the falsetto of Russell Thompkins Jr. and the production of [[Thom Bell]]. During the early 1970s, the group had twelve consecutive R&B top ten hits, including "[[Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)|Stop, Look, Listen]]", "[[You Are Everything]]", "[[Betcha by Golly, Wow]]", "[[I'm Stone in Love with You]]", "[[Break Up to Make Up]]" and "[[You Make Me Feel Brand New]]", which earned them 5 gold singles and 3 gold albums.<ref name="AMG">{{cite web|last1=Erlewine|first1=Stephen Thomas|title=The Stylistics|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stylistics-mn0000567624/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=28 March 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Gold & Platinum The Stylistics |url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&se=The+Stylistics#search_section |website=RIAA |access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
===Early years===
The Stylistics were created from two Philadelphia groups, The Percussions and The Monarchs.<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book

In 1970, the group [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded]] "You're a Big Girl Now", a song their [[road manager]] Marty Bryant [[songwriter|co-wrote]] with Robert Douglas, a member of their [[Backup band|backing band]] Slim and the Boys, and the single became a regional hit for Sebring Records.<ref name="AMG"/> Producer Bill Perry spent $400 to record the song in the Virtue Studios in Philadelphia. The larger [[Avco Records]] soon signed the Stylistics, and the single eventually climbed to No. 7 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] [[record chart|chart]] in early 1971.<ref name="AMG"/>

===Success: The Bell/Creed years===
After signing to Avco, the record label approached producer [[Thom Bell]], who had already produced a catalogue of hits for [[The Delfonics]], to work with the group.<ref name="Jackson, John A 2004">Jackson, John A (2004). ''A House on Fire: The Rise and Fall of Philadelphia Soul''. USA: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-514972-2}}.</ref> The Stylistics auditioned for Bell, but he was initially unimpressed.<ref name="Jackson, John A 2004"/> He ultimately agreed to produce the group because he believed in the potential of lead singer [[Russell Thompkins, Jr.]]'s distinctive, nasal high [[tenor]] and [[falsetto]] voice.<ref name="Jackson, John A 2004"/> Avco gave Bell complete creative control over the Stylistics and he proceeded to focus the group's sound exclusively around Thompkins's voice.<ref name="Jackson, John A 2004"/> On most of the group hits, Bell would have Thompkins sing virtually solo.<ref name="Jackson, John A 2004"/>

The first song recorded with Bell and his [[Collaboration|collaborator]], lyricist [[Linda Creed]], was "[[Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)|Stop, Look, Listen]]".<ref>[http://www.souljonespresents.com/heroes_thom.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211182351/http://www.souljonespresents.com/heroes_thom.html |date=February 11, 2009 }}</ref>

Their hits from this period — distilled from three albums — included "[[Betcha by Golly, Wow]]" (U.S. No. 3), "[[I'm Stone in Love with You]]", "[[Break Up to Make Up]]" (U.S. No. 5), "[[You Make Me Feel Brand New]]" featuring Thompkins singing a lead vocal duet with Airrion Love, "Stop, Look, Listen (To Your Heart)", "[[You Are Everything]]" and the Top 20 pop chart hit "[[Rockin' Roll Baby (song)|Rockin' Roll Baby]]" (U.S. No. 14).  "You Make Me Feel Brand New", the group's biggest U.S. hit, holding at No. 2 for two weeks in 1974, was one of the group's five U.S. [[music recording sales certification|gold]] singles.

The Stylistics also found a path on to [[adult contemporary music|adult contemporary]] airwaves, and the group made ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's Easy Listening singles chart twelve times from 1971 to 1976, with three entries ("Betcha by Golly, Wow", "You Make Me Feel Brand New" and "[[You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)#The Stylistics version|You'll Never Get to Heaven (If You Break My Heart)]]") reaching the Top 10. Every single that Bell produced for the Stylistics was a Top Ten R&B hit, and several — "You Are Everything", "Betcha by Golly Wow!", "I'm Stone in Love with You", "Break Up to Make Up" and "You Make Me Feel Brand New" — were also Top Ten pop [[record chart|chart]] hits.<ref name="AMG"/> The group also enjoyed commercial success with hits with this material throughout Europe.

===Changing style: Continuing international success===
Thom Bell stopped working with the Stylistics in 1974,<ref name="AMG"/> and the split proved commercially difficult for the group in the U.S. They struggled to find the right material, although their partnership with label owners [[Hugo & Luigi]] as producers and arranger Van McCoy started well, with "Let's Put It All Together" (No. 18 pop, No. 8 R&B) and "Heavy Fallin' Out" (No. 4 R&B, No. 41 pop). Later singles were notably less successful, but as U.S. success began to wane, their popularity in Europe, and especially the United Kingdom, increased.<ref name="AMG"/> Indeed, the lighter 'pop' sound fashioned by McCoy and Hugo & Luigi gave the group a U.K. [[Chart-topper|No. 1]] in 1975 with "[[Can't Give You Anything (But My Love)]]".<ref name="AMG"/><ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The Stylistics switched record labels during this period as Avco Records transitioned into [[H&L Records]] in 1976.<ref name="AMG"/> Notwithstanding this, the band began to struggle with increasingly weak material, and although the singles and albums came out as before, by 1978 chart success had vanished; even a move to Mercury in 1978, for two albums produced by Teddy Randazzo, failed to produce any major success. Russell Thompkins Jr. wrote (in the sleevenotes for the re-issue of the 1976 album, ''Fabulous'') that the group began to feel that the music they were recording was becoming dated, and not in keeping with the popular [[disco]] sound of the late 1970s.

In 1979, they had a small part in the movie ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'', directed by [[Miloš Forman]], where they play conservative army officers. They double [[Nell Carter]] in singing a song called "White Boys".

===Later years===
In 1980, the group reunited with Thom Bell and signed with [[Philadelphia International Records]] subsidiary, TSOP Records. They released the single "[[Hurry Up This Way Again]]" that year which brought them back into the R&B Top 20 (peaking at No. 18). Both James Dunn and James Smith departed due to conflicts over the direction of the group; Dunn left before the recording of the album ''Hurry Up This Way Again'' (1980) and Smith after the recording of ''Closer Than Close'' in 1981.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Stylistics {{!}} Biography & History |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-stylistics-mn0000567624/biography |website=AllMusic |access-date=19 April 2021 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Stylistics |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2131664/bio |website=IMDb |access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref><ref>Taylor, Marc (1996).

Love, Murrell and Thompkins continued to [[concert tour|tour]] until 2000, when Thompkins, Jr. left the group.

In 2000, singer Eban Brown (formerly of The Delfonics, The Manhattans, and Ray, Goodman and Brown) replaced Thompkins as lead singer. That same year, tenor singer Van Fields, who had previously sung with the A Cappella group "A Perfect Blend", joined, enabling The Stylistics to grow from a trio back to a quartet. The group was featured live on the DVD ''The Stylistics Live at the Convocation Center'' (2006), as well as with other artists of the 1970s on the DVD, ''70s Soul Jam''.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Stylistics – In Concert 2005 (2005, DVD) |url=https://www.discogs.com/The-Stylistics-In-Concert-2005/release/3468636 |access-date=19 April 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2004, after having left The Stylistics in 2000, former lead singer Thompkins launched his own group called Russell Thompkins Jr, & The New Stylistics, returning with former member Johnson, plus James Ranton and Jonathan Buckson.<ref>{{cite web |title=The New Stylistics to Bring Classic Soul Sound to SOPAC Benefit Concert June 1 |url=https://www.tapinto.net/towns/soma/sections/arts-and-entertainment/articles/the-new-stylistics-to-bring-classic-soul-sound-to |website=TAPinto |access-date=19 April 2021 |language=en}}</ref> They were featured on the DVD ''Old School Soul Party Live!,'' which was part of the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''My Music'' series.<ref>{{cite web |title=Old School Soul Party Live [DVD] - Various Artists {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/old-school-soul-party-live-dvd-mw0001441710 |access-date=19 April 2021 |language=en}}</ref>

In 2011, Fields departed from the group after 11 years, due to creative differences, and was replaced by singer Jason Sharp.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jason Sharp becomes newest member of the Stylistics |url=https://www.soultracks.com/story-jason-sharp-stylistics |website=SoulTracks - Soul Music Biographies, News and Reviews |access-date=19 April 2021 |language=en |date=26 May 2012}}</ref>

In January 2018, after 18 years with The Stylistics, Brown, who is also a jazz guitarist and composer, announced his departure to concentrate on his solo career.
