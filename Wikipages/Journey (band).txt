'''Journey''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in [[San Francisco]] in 1973 by former members of [[Santana (band)|Santana]], [[Steve Miller Band]], and [[Frumious Bandersnatch]]. 

Journey had their biggest commercial success between 1978 and 1987, when [[Steve Perry]] was lead vocalist; they released a series of hit songs, including "[[Don't Stop Believin']]{{-"}} (1981), which in 2009 became the top-selling track in [[iTunes Store|iTunes]] history among songs not released in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Journey&sort=CertificationDate&sense=ASC&perPage=25 |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |access-date=April 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924155842/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&artist=Journey&sort=CertificationDate&sense=ASC&perPage=25 |archive-date=September 24, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journeyband.com/ |title=The Sony Music Journey Home &#124; The Sony Music Journey Site |publisher=Journeyband.com |access-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090725192301/http://www.journeyband.com/ |archive-date=July 25, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''[[Escape (Journey album)|Escape]]'', Journey's seventh and most successful album, reached No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and yielded another of their most popular singles, "[[Open Arms (Journey song)|Open Arms]]".

Originally a [[progressive rock]] band, Journey was described by [[AllMusic]] as having cemented a reputation as "one of [[United States|America]]'s most beloved (and sometimes hated) commercial rock/pop bands" by 1978, when they redefined their sound by embracing pop arrangements on their fourth album, ''[[Infinity (Journey album)|Infinity]]''.<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r10632|pure_url=yes}} Journey: ''Infinity'']. [[AllMusic]]. Retrieved September 2, 2010.</ref>

==History==

===1973–1977: Formation, ''Journey'', ''Look into the Future'' and ''Next''===
The original members of Journey came together in [[San Francisco]] in 1973 under the auspices of former Santana manager [[Walter Herbert (manager)|Herbie Herbert]]. Originally called the Golden Gate Rhythm Section and intended to serve as a [[Backup band|backup group]] for established [[Bay Area]] artists, the band included Santana alumni [[Neal Schon]] on lead guitar and [[Gregg Rolie]] on keyboards and lead vocals. Bassist [[Ross Valory]] and rhythm guitarist [[George Tickner]], both of [[Frumious Bandersnatch]], rounded out the group. [[Prairie Prince]] of [[The Tubes]] served as drummer. After one performance in Hawaii, the band quickly abandoned the "backup group" concept and developed a distinctive [[jazz fusion]] style. After an unsuccessful radio contest to name the group, [[roadie]] John Villanueva<ref name="Journey 1983">''Journey: Frontiers and Beyond'' video, NFL Films, 1983.</ref> suggested the name "Journey".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-tribute.com/journey/resources/faq/faq-s2.html |title=Journey FAQ at Steve Lake's Journey Tribute Page |publisher=Journey-tribute.com |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=September 23, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923074215/http://www.journey-tribute.com/journey/resources/faq/faq-s2.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 10–11.</ref>

The band's first public appearance came at the [[Winterland Ballroom]] on [[New Year’s Eve]] 1973 to an audience of 10,000, and the following day, would fly to Hawaii to perform at the Diamond Head Crater to a larger audience. Prairie Prince rejoined The Tubes shortly thereafter, and on February 1, 1974, the band hired British drummer [[Aynsley Dunbar]], who had recently worked with [[David Bowie]] and had been a member of the second iteration of [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[Mothers of Invention]]. On February 5, 1974, the new line-up made their debut at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in front of [[Columbia Records]] executives and secured a [[recording contract]] with the label following the performance and later performing at venues around the Bay Area.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 11–13.</ref>

Journey went into CBS Studios in November 1974 with producer Roy Halee to record their debut album [[Journey (Journey album)|Journey]]. It was released in April 1975 entering the Billboard charts at number 138. Rhythm guitarist Tickner left the band due to the amount of heavy touring the band was doing in promoting the album, allowing Schon to take on the full guitar duties. The band entered the studio again in late 1975 to record ''[[Look into the Future]]'', which was released in January 1976 and entered the Billboard Top 200 charts at number 100. The band promoted the album with a two-hour performance at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, which later aired on the radio as touring continued to promote their second album.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 13–15.</ref>

From May to October 1976, the band went to His Master's Wheels Studios to record their third studio album, ''[[Next (Journey album)|Next]]'', which, just like the previous album, was produced by the band themselves. They brought in a much more commercial sound while keeping their jazz fusion and progressive rock roots.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 17.</ref> The album was released in February and charted on the Billboard Top 200 at number 85.<ref name="untoldjourney19"/> However, sales did not improve and Columbia Records was on the verge of dropping the band.<ref name="untoldjourney223">Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 22–23.</ref>

===1977–1980: New musical direction, ''Infinity'', ''Evolution'' and ''Departure''===
{{quote|I still think some of the stuff we did then was great. Some of it was self-indulgent, just jamming for ourselves, but I also think a lot of other things hurt us in the early days. It took a while for the politics to sort of shape up.<br>— Neal Schon<ref name="untoldjourney19">Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 19.</ref>}}

As Journey's album sales did not improve, Columbia Records requested that they change their musical style and add a frontman who would share lead vocals with Rolie.<ref name="untoldjourney223"/> The band hired [[Robert Fleischman]] and made the transition to a more popular style, akin to that of [[Foreigner (band)|Foreigner]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]]. Journey went on tour with Fleischman in 1977, opening for bands like Black Sabbath, Target, Judas Priest and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. Fleischman and the rest of the band began writing and rehearsing new songs, including the hit "[[Wheel in the Sky]]".<ref name="untoldjourney223"/><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 24–25.</ref> During a performance before approximately 100,000 at Soldier Field in Chicago, the band was introduced to [[Steve Perry]]. Differences between Fleischman and manager Herbie Herbert resulted in Fleischman's departure from the band within the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melodicrock.com/interviews/robertfleischman.html |title=Interviews |publisher=Melodicrock.com |access-date=March 1, 2011 |archive-date=November 27, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127144312/http://melodicrock.com/interviews/robertfleischman.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Features/Interviews/26_01-03/RF.htm |title=Robert Fleischman interview at The Journey Zone |publisher=Journey-zone.com |date=August 14, 2009 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=August 24, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824202333/http://www.journey-zone.com/Features/Interviews/26_01-03/RF.htm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 26–27.</ref>

Journey hired Steve Perry as their new lead singer. He made his live debut with the band at the Old Waldorf in October 1977, stepping into His Master's Studios and Cherokee Studios from October to December. Herbie Herbert, the band's manager, hired [[Roy Thomas Baker]] as producer to add a layered sound approach similar to that of Baker's previous band, [[Queen (band)|Queen]].<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 29.</ref> With their new lead singer and new producer, the band's fourth studio album, ''[[Infinity (Journey album)|Infinity]]'', released in January 1978, peaked at number 21 in Billboard.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 31.</ref>

According to the band's manager Herbie Herbert, there were tensions between Aynsley Dunbar and the band due to the change in music direction from the jazz fusion sound. Neal Schon reflected on the tensions: "We would talk about it, and he'd say he'd be willing to simplify things. But we'd get out there, and after five shows he wasn't doing that at all." Dunbar started playing erratically and talking derogatorily about the other members, which later resulted in Herbert firing Dunbar after the Infinity tour. Dunbar was replaced by [[Berklee College of Music|Berklee]]-trained drummer and [[Montrose (band)|Montrose]] member [[Steve Smith (musician)|Steve Smith]].<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 34–35.</ref><ref name="journey-zone1">{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Interviews/2003.htm#8 |title=Steve Smith interview at The Journey Zone |publisher=Journey-zone.com |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=July 13, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121635/http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Interviews/2003.htm#8 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Perry, Schon, Rolie, Smith and Valory entered Cherokee Studios in late 1978 to record their fifth studio album ''[[Evolution (Journey album)|Evolution]]'' which was later released in March 1979, peaking at number 20 in Billboard. The album, which would be a milestone for the band, gave the band their first [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] Top 20 single, "[[Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin']]", peaking at number 16 which gave the band significant airplay.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 36–38.</ref> Following the tour in support of ''Evolution'', the band expanded its operation to include a lighting and trucking operation for their future performances as the tour had grossed more than $5 million, making the band as popular as it had ever been in five years.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Kozak |first1=Roman |title=Lighting and Trucking Areas Attract Journey |magazine=Billboard |date=November 3, 1979 |page=36 |location=New York |issn=0006-2510}}</ref> The band later entered Automatt Studios to record their sixth studio album ''[[Departure (Journey album)|Departure]]'' which was released in March 1980, peaking at number 8 in Billboard. The first single off of the album, "[[Any Way You Want It]]", peaked number 23 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] in 1980.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 42; 44.</ref>

Keyboardist Gregg Rolie left the band following the ''Departure'' tour to start a family and undertake various solo projects. It was the second time in his career he had departed from a successful act.<ref>Flans, "Journey;" [http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/page7.html Matt Carty's Herbie Herbert Interview, p. 7.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124085414/http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/page7.html |date=November 24, 2011 }}</ref> Keyboardist [[Stevie "Keys" Roseman]] was brought in to record the lone studio track, "The Party's Over (Hopelessly in Love)", on the band's live album ''Captured''.<ref>''Captured'' re-issue (2006) liner notes, p. 15, lines 8–9; ''Time (Cubed)'' liner notes pp. 11–14.</ref> Rolie suggested pianist [[Jonathan Cain]] of [[The Babys]] as his permanent replacement. With Cain's synthesizers replacing Rolie's [[Hammond B-3 organ|organ]], Cain had become the new member of the band.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 48–51.</ref>

===1981–1983: Height of popularity, ''Escape'' and ''Frontiers''===
With Cain joining as the new keyboard player, the band entered Fantasy Studios in Berkeley, California, in late 1980, releasing their seventh studio album, ''[[Escape (Journey album)|Escape]]'', in July 1981. ''Escape'' became their most successful album, charting at number one in the United States. The album had a clutch of hit singles which included: "[[Who's Crying Now]]", "Still They Ride", "[[Open Arms (Journey song)|Open Arms]]", and the iconic "[[Don't Stop Believin']]".<ref name="untoldjourneydsb">Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 53–55.</ref>

The band began another lengthy yet successful tour on June 12, 1981, supported by opening acts [[Billy Squier]], [[Greg Kihn Band]], [[Point Blank (band)|Point Blank]], and [[Loverboy]], and Journey opened for The Rolling Stones on September 25. [[MTV]] videotaped one of their two sold-out shows in [[Houston]] on November 6, 1981, in front of over 20,000 fans, later released on DVD.<ref>''Journey: Live in Houston'' DVD, 1981. The band also pioneered the use of a very large video screen at live performances, allowing them to increasingly perform before stadium-sized crowds.</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 57–58, 70.</ref>

Following the success of the 1981 tour, the band's full establishment as a corporation, and the formation of a fan club called "Journey Force", the band released "Only Solutions" and "1990s Theme" for the 1982 Disney film, Tron. Schon had also made time to work with Jan Hammer on a few albums.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 58–61.</ref> Journey continued touring in 1982 with shows in North America and Japan.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 63.</ref>

With millions of records, hit singles, and tickets sold, the band entered Fantasy Studios again in the middle of their 1982 tour to record their eighth studio album, ''[[Frontiers (Journey album)|Frontiers]]''. Released in February 1983, the band's second biggest selling album sold over six million copies, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard charts, and spawning the hit singles "[[Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)]]", "[[Faithfully (song)|Faithfully]]", "[[Send Her My Love]]" and "[[After the Fall (song)|After the Fall]]".<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 68.</ref>

Journey began the ''Frontiers'' tour in Japan, and continued in North America with Bryan Adams as opening act.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 70.</ref> During the tour, [[NFL Films]] recorded a video documentary of their life on the road, ''Frontiers and Beyond'', shooting scenes at [[JFK Stadium]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania with more than 80,000 fans in attendance.<ref name="Journey 1983"/>

===1984–1987: ''Raised on Radio'' and more personnel changes===
After the ''Frontiers'' tour, the band took some time off. Lead singer [[Steve Perry]] and guitarist [[Neal Schon]] both pursued solo projects. In 1984 Steve Perry, with the help of the band's manager, Herbie Herbert recorded and released his first solo album, ''Street Talk''. Neal Schon toured briefly in 1984 with his supergroup [[Hagar Schon Aaronson Shrieve|HSAS]], in support of their sole album, ''Through the Fire'' released that year on Geffen.<ref name="journeyror1">Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 76–77.</ref>

When asked if Journey was over due to the selling of their properties at the end of 1984, Neal Schon commented, "No way Journey's ending. We're all too committed to this band to ever let that happen. In fact, one of the reasons we decided to go off in separate directions for a while was to keep the band as strong as ever."<ref name="journeyror1"/>

Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, Journey returned to Fantasy Studios in late 1985 to record their ninth studio album ''[[Raised on Radio]]'', but with Perry taking the role as the album's producer. Tensions within the band were shown when Herbert and Perry fired both bass player Ross Valory and drummer Steve Smith for musical and professional differences a few months into the recording sessions for the album, though Valory later admitted he left the band on his own accord.<ref name="journey-zone1"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journeymusic.com/discography.html |title=Discography |publisher=Journeymusic.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080203102816/http://www.journeymusic.com/discography.html |archive-date=February 3, 2008}}</ref> Bassist and future ''[[American Idol]]'' judge [[Randy Jackson]], bassist Bob Glaub, and established drummer [[Larrie Londin]] were brought in to continue the album's recordings.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 78–81.</ref> ''Raised on Radio'' was released in May 1986, peaking at number four on Billboard's album chart, but underperforming compared to the band's previous two efforts.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 83–84.</ref> It featured five singles: The top ten hit "[[Be Good to Yourself]]" along with "[[Suzanne (Journey song)|Suzanne]]", "[[Girl Can't Help It (song)|Girl Can't Help It]]", "[[I'll Be Alright Without You]]" and "Why Can't This Night Go On Forever?".<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 83.</ref>

The ''Raised on Radio'' tour began at Angels Camp in August 1986 and would perform sold-out shows throughout the United States before concluding with two shows in Anchorage in early 1987, with selected dates supported by Honeymoon Suite, The Outfield, and Glass Tiger. The tour would feature both Randy Jackson on bass and [[Mike Baird (musician)|Mike Baird]] on drums, and was videotaped by MTV for a documentary that included interviews with the band members which was called ''Raised on Radio'', the same as the album title.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 86–87.</ref>

With tensions between Perry, the band and the band's manager Herbie Herbert at an all-time high following the tour's conclusion, Perry was unable or unwilling to remain actively involved and was tired of touring as it was affecting his health and his vocals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/index.html |title=2001 Herbie Herbert Interview with Matt Carty, pp. 13–14 |publisher=Members.cox.net |access-date=September 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023172549/http://members.cox.net/mrcarty/index.html |archive-date=October 23, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |title=The Q: GQ |publisher=Men.style.com |access-date=March 1, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201134817/http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |archive-date=February 1, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name="steveperry1987">Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 89.</ref>

===1987–1995: Hiatus===
The band went into a hiatus following the ''Raised on Radio'' tour. Columbia Records released the ''[[Greatest Hits (Journey album)|Greatest Hits]]'' compilation in November 1988, which became one of the biggest selling greatest hits albums, selling over 15 million copies and continuing to sell half a million to a million copies per year. The compilation spent 750 weeks on the Billboard album charts until 2008.<ref name="journeyhiatus1">Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 91–93.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=Gold & Platinum – August 3, 2009 |publisher=RIAA |access-date=August 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701162536/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archive-date=July 1, 2007 }}</ref>

While Perry had retreated from the public eye, Schon and Cain spent the rest of 1987 collaborating with artists such as [[Jimmy Barnes]] and [[Michael Bolton]] before teaming up with Cain's ex-Babys bandmates [[John Waite]] and [[Ricky Phillips]] to form the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Bad English]] with drummer [[Deen Castronovo]] in 1988, releasing two albums in 1989 and 1991. Steve Smith devoted his time to his jazz bands, [[Vital Information]] and [[Steps Ahead]], and teamed up with Ross Valory and original Journey keyboardist Gregg Rolie to create [[The Storm (American band)|The Storm]] with singer [[Kevin Chalfant]] and guitarist Josh Ramos, along with Herbie Herbert as the band's manager as he did with Journey with Scott Boorey.<ref name="journeyhiatus1"/>

On November 3, 1991, Schon, Cain, and Perry re-united to perform "Faithfully" and "Lights" at the [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] tribute concert 'Laughter, Love & Music' at Golden Gate Park, following the concert promoter's death in a helicopter accident.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 95.</ref> In October 1993, Schon, Rolie, Valory, Dunbar, Smith, and Cain reunited and performed at a private dinner for their manager Herbie Herbert at Bimbo's in San Francisco, with Kevin Chalfant on lead vocals.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 97.</ref><ref name="auto2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.melodicrock.com/articles/interviews/2014/03/12/herbie-herbert-one-mans-journey|title=Herbie Herbert: One Man's Journey|date=March 13, 2014|website=MelodicRock.com|access-date=April 22, 2020|archive-date=April 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200403012708/https://www.melodicrock.com/articles/interviews/2014/03/12/herbie-herbert-one-mans-journey|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the breakup of Bad English in 1991, Schon and Castronovo formed the [[glam metal]] band [[Hardline (band)|Hardline]] with brothers [[Johnny Gioeli|Johnny and Joey Gioeli]], releasing only one studio album before his departure. Neal would later join [[Paul Rodgers]] in 1993 for live performances, alongside Dean Castronovo.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 96–97.</ref> In 1994, Steve Perry had released his second solo album ''[[For the Love of Strange Medicine]]'', and toured North America in support of the album, though his voice had changed since the last time he had performed.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 98.</ref>

===1995–1997: Reunion and ''Trial by Fire''===
Perry made the decision to reunite with Journey under the condition that Herbie Herbert would no longer be the band's manager. The band hired Irving Azoff, longtime [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] manager, as the new manager for the band in October 1995. Steve Smith and Ross Valory reunited with Journey and the band started writing material for their next album, with rehearsals beginning that same month.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 100.</ref>

The band began recording their tenth studio album, ''[[Trial by Fire (Journey album)|Trial by Fire]]'' in early 1996 at The Site and Wildhorse Studio in Marin County and Ocean Way Recorders in which they would record under the producer Kevin Shirley.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 102.</ref> It was later released in late October that year, peaking at number three on the Billboard album charts. The album's hit single "[[When You Love a Woman]]", which reached number 12 on the ''Billboard'' charts, and was nominated in 1997 for a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm |title=39th Annual Grammy Award Winners and Nominees for 1997 |publisher=Rock on the Net |date=February 26, 1997 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=December 28, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071228081340/http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/1997/grammys.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The album also produced three top 40 [[mainstream rock]] tracks, "Message of Love" reaching number 18, "Can't Tame the Lion" reaching number 33, and "If He Should Break Your Heart" reaching number 38.<ref>Billboard.com Journey's ''Trial by Fire'' singles</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 109.</ref>

Plans for a subsequent tour ended when Perry, troubled by pain while hiking in Hawaii on a ten-day break in August 1996, discovered he had a degenerative bone condition and could not perform without hip replacement surgery—which for some time he declined to undergo, later admitting he had other physical issues. The accident resulted in the album's release date being delayed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51425/episode_about.jhtml |title=Behind the Music: Journey |work=Vh1 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=April 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423134541/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/behind_the_music/51425/episode_about.jhtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="GQ Blog on men.style.com">{{cite web|first=Alex |last=Pappademas |url=http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |title=Foolish, Foolish Throat: A Q&A with Steve Perry |publisher=Men.style.com |date=May 29, 2008 |access-date=March 1, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201134817/http://men.style.com/gq/blogs/gqeditors/2008/05/foolish-foolish.html |archive-date=February 1, 2009}}</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 106–107.</ref>

The album upon its release was considered the worst selling album that failed to match up to the charm of the band's previous work. Schon would later admit that the album had too many ballads and fans just wanted to hear a rock sound: "Even on our last record, the ''Trial By Fire'' record, a lot of the rock stuff just got shelved and ended up being like twenty ballads, I don't know how many ballads." The band would take a break following the album's release to work on solo projects, waiting for Perry to make up his mind on if he wanted to tour. Schon would release his solo album ''Electric World'' in 1997, later creating Abraxas Pool with former Journey member Gregg Rolie, drummer Michael Shrieve and a few former Santana members. Cain would release his two solo albums, ''Body Language'' in 1997, and ''For A Lifetime'' in early 1998.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 110–111.</ref>

===1998–2007: Lead singer and drummer replaced, ''Arrival'' and ''Generations''===
[[File:Journeymm2002.jpg|thumb|right|Journey in 2002: Steve Augeri, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory, Deen Castronovo and Neal Schon]] 
Following the reunion album's release, the band was becoming restless of waiting for an answer from Perry regarding touring. Following a phone call between Cain and Perry, Perry would later announce that he would be departing from Journey, releasing himself from the band's contracts and making the decision to semi-retire from the music business, disappearing from the public eye again. Steve Smith would later exit the band, citing that Journey would not be Journey without Perry, and returning to his jazz career and his project Vital Information.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 115–117.</ref>

The band hired drummer Deen Castronovo, Schon's and Cain's [[Bad English]] bandmate and drummer for [[Hardline (band)|Hardline]], to replace Steve Smith. After auditioning several high-profile candidates, including [[Geoff Tate]], Kevin Chalfant and [[John West (musician)|John West]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.melodic-rock.com/interviews/nealschon.html|title=Melodicrock Interviews: Neal Schon|publisher=melodicrock.com|access-date=September 10, 2018|archive-date=September 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180910060907/http://www.melodic-rock.com/interviews/nealschon.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Journey replaced Perry with [[Steve Augeri]], formerly of [[Tyketto]] and [[Tall Stories (band)|Tall Stories]].<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 118.</ref> The band would later record the song "Remember Me" which would be featured on the ''Armageddon'' soundtrack for the 1998 film. Upon the song's release, the song had shown fans that the band made the right decision in hiring Augeri.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 121.</ref>

Following a rehearsal with Augeri and Castronovo, the band went to Japan to perform four gigs, which was a known stronghold for the band's performances. When asked how he felt about touring again in over a decade, Schon commented: "It's a little like we are reborn again." Journey embarked on a tour in the United States titled Vacation's Over which began in October and concluded at the end of December in Reno. They would continue the tour with another leg in 1999, beginning in Minnesota in June and concluding in Michigan in September.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 122–123.</ref>

From March to August 2000, the band entered Avatar Studios to record their next studio album, ''[[Arrival (Journey album)|Arrival]]'' with producer Kevin Shirley. The album was released in Japan later in the year.  A North American release of the album followed in April 2001. The album had peaked at number 56 on the Billboard charts. The album's single "All the Way" failed to boost sales for the album which was considered a disappointment with mixed opinions regarding the album and resulted in Sony dropping the band from their label. Upon the album's completion, the band embarked on a tour in support of the album in Latin America, the United States and Europe.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 123–126; 131.</ref>

During the events of September 11, 2001, in response to the attacks in New York City, the band joined various bands at a major fundraising event to help the victims and families of the attack held on October 20 and 21 at the Smirnoff Music Centre in Dallas, Texas. The event raised about one million dollars.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 132–133.</ref>

Activity in Journey was quiet in 2002, Schon would form Planet Us with bandmate Castronovo, Sammy Hagar and former Van Halen bassist Michael Anthony until 2004 when the band had disbanded. Schon would also co-write songs alongside the band Bad Company, while Cain released another solo album. Having made some recordings between 2001 and 2002, the band released a four-track EP titled ''[[Red 13]]'' in November under their new label "Journey Music", with an album cover design chosen through a fan contest with the online cover designed by Kelly McDonald while the retail cover which was only made available at the band's performances was designed by Christopher Payne. The band only performed one club gig in support of the EP, but later began another tour of the United States from May to August in 2003. The band continued touring the following year with another summer tour titled Summer Detour which began from June and concluded in September 2004. In November, Journey would later join both REO Speedwagon and Styx for a tour around the Caribbean aboard the Triumph cruise ship.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 133–136.</ref>

In 2005, the members of Journey was inducted into the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] alongside former members Perry, Dunbar, Tickner, Steve Smith and Fleischmann. Rolie was the only member who did not appear at the ceremony. Surprised to see Perry joining them to accept the induction with the band, Valory commented on the wonderful things Perry had to say in which he looked to be in fine shape, and that it was a pleasant surprise to see him.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 137–138.</ref>

Following their accolade on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the band began recording at the Record Plant in Sausalito, California for their twelfth studio album, ''[[Generations (Journey album)|Generations]]'' which would feature producer Kevin Elson who collaborated with the band before. The album was released on August 29 in Europe with a North American release following on October 4. The album peaked at number 170 on the Billboard charts. To promote the album and celebrate the band's 30th anniversary, the band embarked on a tour starting in Irvine, California in June and concluding in Phoenix on October. Each concert on the tour was three hours long with an intermission and featured many of their classic hits as well as the inclusion of the new songs from the album.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 139–146.</ref>

In 2006, the band toured in Europe and then joined [[Def Leppard]] in a North American tour. During the tours however, there were suggestions that Augeri was not singing but was using backing tracks to cover up his deteriorating vocals, resulting in him getting attacked by the fans. Augeri had been suffering from vocal attrition problems before the band began the tour with Def Leppard and Journey had been accused of using pre-recorded lead vocals,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Editorials/2009.htm#06 |title=A Personal Journey Chapters Six, Seven, and Eight |publisher=Journey-zone.com |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=September 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909040146/http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/Editorials/2009.htm#06 |url-status=live }}</ref> an accusation that former manager Herbie Herbert insists was true.<ref name="auto2"/> Valory denied the accusations, stating that it was an urban myth, and that Augeri's vocals did not give out. In a press statement, the band later announced that Augeri had to step down as Journey's lead singer and leave the tour to recover. Augeri performed his last show with Journey on July 4 in Raleigh.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', pp. 148–151.</ref>

With the successful tour still happening, the band were quick to hire Jeff Scott Soto from [[Talisman (band)|Talisman]] as their lead vocalist. He performed as Journey's vocalist for the first time on July 7 in Bristow. The tour, by its success and popularity would later be extended to November. Soto would later be officially announced as the band's new vocalist in December 2006.<ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 152–153; 158.</ref> Following tours of Europe and the United States in 2007, the band announced on June 12 that Soto was no longer with them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punktv.ca/?c=131&a=2184 |title='Journey names Jeff Scott Soto official new lead singer' at |publisher=Punktv.ca |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304223212/http://punktv.ca/?c=131&a=2184 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/News/2004.htm#2007 |title='Journey announces departure of Jeff Scott Soto' reprinted from journeymusic.com at The Journey Zone |publisher=Journey-zone.com |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-date=March 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100325162614/http://www.journey-zone.com/Archive/News/2004.htm#2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> In a statement, Schon stated: "He did a tremendous job for us and we wish him the best.

===2007–2019: Lead singer replaced again, ''Revelation'' and ''Eclipse''===
[[File:Journey band.JPG|thumb|left|Journey in 2008: Valory, Cain, Pineda, Schon, and Castronovo.]] 
Following Soto's departure, the band was without a lead vocalist again. [[Neal Schon]] began searching [[YouTube]] for a new lead vocalist, with Jeremey Hunsicker of the Journey tribute band Frontiers auditioning and spending a week with the band writing material.<ref name="roanoke">{{cite web |last=Dickens |first=Tad |url=http://www.roanoke.com/entertainment/wb/146327 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130201222611/http://www.roanoke.com/entertainment/wb/146327 |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 1, 2013 |title=His new Journey leads to old Frontiers |work=Roanoke Times |date=January 9, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://voices.yahoo.com/jeremey-hunsicker-different-guy-same-ol-sound-1357201.html |title=Jeremey Hunsicker - Different Guy, Same Ol' Sound.. |publisher=Yahoo Voices |date=April 7, 2008 |access-date=April 18, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728221141/http://voices.yahoo.com/jeremey-hunsicker-different-guy-same-ol-sound-1357201.html |archive-date=July 28, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Hunsicker claims to have been formally offered the position, but it fell through shortly afterwards following tension with Schon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fabricationshq.com/jeremey-frederick-hunsicker-march-2012.html|title=Covering every little thing...

Schon later found [[Filipino people|Filipino]] singer [[Arnel Pineda]] of the cover band The Zoo, covering the song "Faithfully". Schon was so impressed that he contacted Pineda to set up two days of auditions with him which went well, and later naming him the official lead vocalist of Journey on December 5, 2007.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/journey-finds-new-singer-the-old-fashioned-way-on-the-internet-99867/|title=Journey Finds New Singer the Old-Fashioned Way: On the Internet|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 6, 2007|access-date=October 31, 2018|archive-date=October 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181031214848/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/journey-finds-new-singer-the-old-fashioned-way-on-the-internet-99867/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 171.</ref>

Although Pineda was neither the first foreign national to become a member of Journey (former drummer Aynsley Dunbar is British), nor even the first non-white (bass player Randy Jackson is African-American), his recruitment resulted in some fans of Journey making racist comments towards the new vocalist. Keyboardist Jonathan Cain responded to such sentiments in the ''[[Marin Independent Journal]]'': "We've become a world band. We're international now. We're not about one color."<ref>{{cite web |first=Paul |last=Liberatore |url=http://www.marinij.com/ci_7826224?IADID |title=An incredible journey for band's new frontman |publisher=Marinij.com |date=December 27, 2007 |access-date=September 10, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311052729/http://www.marinij.com/ci_7826224?IADID |archive-date=March 11, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Daniels, ''The Untold Story of Journey'', p. 173.</ref>

===2020–present: Contested lineup changes, lawsuits and potential new album===
On March 3, 2020, Schon and Cain announced that they had fired Smith and Valory and were suing them for an alleged "attempted corporate ''coup d'état,''" seeking damages in excess of $10 million. The lawsuit alleged Smith and Valory tried to "assume control of Nightmare Productions because they incorrectly believe that Nightmare Productions controls the Journey name and Mark" in order to "hold the Journey name hostage and set themselves up with a guaranteed income stream after they stop performing." Valory and Smith contested the firings, with the support of former manager Herbie Herbert and former lead singer Steve Perry. Court filings revealed that Steve Perry had been paid as a member of the band for years despite not performing. In an open letter dated that same day, Schon and Cain stated Smith and Valory "are no longer members of Journey; and that Schon and Cain have lost confidence in both of them and are not willing to perform with them again."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theriver107.com/2020/03/06/why-journey-are-paying-steve-perry-not-to-sing/|title=Why Journey Are Paying Steve Perry Not to Sing|publisher=WRRL.com|access-date=March 9, 2020|date=March 6, 2020|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823193832/https://theriver107.com/2020/03/06/why-journey-are-paying-steve-perry-not-to-sing/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200303006138/en/?fbclid=IwAR0peRnFmloJFChvywFD8133W3nNuFy4jb6YH859WZo-vVIvsSV0I1geWxI|title=Miller Barondess Files Lawsuit on Behalf of Key Members of Iconic Rock Band Journey—Neal Schon and Jon Cain—Against Dissident Band Members|date=March 3, 2020|work=Business Wire|access-date=March 4, 2020|archive-date=August 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200823193833/https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200303006138/en/|url-status=live}}</ref> Valory counter-sued Schon and Cain, among other things, for their partnership's claim of owning the Journey [[trademark]] and [[service mark]] (collectively known as the mark), when that partnership, Elmo Partners, was only the licensee of the mark from 1985 to 1994, when the license was terminated by [[Walter Herbert (manager)|Herbie Herbert]] of Nightmare Productions, owners of the mark and name.
