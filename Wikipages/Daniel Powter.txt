'''Daniel Richard Powter''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|aʊ|t|ər}}; born February 25, 1971) is a Canadian musician. He is best known for his self-penned hit song "[[Bad Day (Daniel Powter song)|Bad Day]]" (2005), which was top of the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for five weeks.

==Early life==
Powter grew up in [[Vernon, British Columbia|Vernon]], in the [[Okanagan|Okanagan-Shuswap]] region of [[British Columbia]], alongside Tyrone and Susan Powter.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}} As a child, Powter played the [[violin]] at the age of 4. He changed to [[piano]] at 10 years old after a group of children bullied him, trashed and destroyed his violin. Suffering from [[dyslexia]], Powter had trouble in university reading music, and dropped out at the age of 20 in order to pursue his own musical career, learning all songs by ear and recording new melodies that he created. He started writing songs when he was 13 years old.

Powter met producer Jeff Dawson in 1997 and released his debut studio album, ''I'm Your Betty'', on June 21, 2000.<ref name="am"/> The album, limited to a very small print, contains ten songs, two of which&mdash;"More Than I" and "Negative Fashion"&mdash;were both featured on the television show ''[[Higher Ground (TV series)|Higher Ground]]'' in the episode "Wherefore Art Thou".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ztvB1MPXag|title=Higher Ground Episode 12|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>

==Self-titled album (2005–2006)==
[[File:Daniel Powter.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Powter at the [[MTV Asia Awards]] 2006 in [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]]]]

Powter's first single, "[[Bad Day (Daniel Powter song)|Bad Day]]", was first released in [[Europe]] in mid-2005, in advance of his second album, ''[[Daniel Powter (album)|Daniel Powter]]''. [[Warner Bros. Records]] submitted the single for commercials, and it was subsequently chosen by [[Coca-Cola]] as the theme song for an ad campaign in Europe. The song achieved heavy airplay in most European countries, peaking at number three on the overall European airplay chart. It reached number one on national airplay in [[Germany]], number one on the singles charts in the [[Republic of Ireland]]<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070313142827/http://www.charttrack.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2005&year=2005&week=33 TOP 50 SINGLES, WEEK ENDING 18 August 2005]. Irish Music Charts Archive</ref> and [[Italy]], number two in the [[United Kingdom]]&mdash;where it stayed in the top ten for thirteen weeks&mdash;and number three in [[Australia]].

In the [[United States]], "Bad Day" was used extensively on the television series ''[[American Idol]]'' in its [[American Idol (season 5)|fifth season]]. Powter sang the song live at the end of the final show of that season on May 23, 2006. The song reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], [[Adult Top 40]] and [[Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks|Adult Contemporary]] charts, making Powter the first solo Canadian male artist to top the Hot 100 since [[Bryan Adams]] in 1995 (with "[[Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman?]]"). The song also reached number one in Powter's homeland, Canada.

On May 31, 2005, Powter released his first extended play known as "Free Loop."<ref>{{cite web | url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/bad-day/64758779?i=64758775 | title=Free Loop EP by Daniel Powter | date=31 May 2005 | publisher=[[Apple Music]]. [[Apple Music]] | access-date=June 15, 2018}}</ref>

On July 2, 2005, Powter performed at the Berlin installment of [[Live 8]], a simultaneous group of concerts in nine countries intended to raise awareness of [[poverty in Africa]] and put pressure on world leaders for aid.

"Bad Day" came in fifth in the British [[The Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] 2005. In 2006, Powter won in the [[Juno Award for New Artist of the Year|New Artist of the Year]] category at the Canadian [[Juno Awards]], and was nominated for Best International Breakthrough Act at the [[BRIT Awards]]. "Bad Day" was nominated at the 2006 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] for Hot 100 Single of the Year, and was named ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine's song of the year in 2006.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56556/2006-billboard-music-awards-finalists|title=2006 Billboard Music Awards Finalists|date=November 29, 2006|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> At the 2007 [[Grammy Awards]], Powter received a [[Best Male Pop Vocal Performance]] nomination for the song.

The subsequent singles from ''Daniel Powter'' – "[[Jimmy Gets High]]", "[[Free Loop (One Night Stand)|Free Loop]]", and "Lie to Me" – were released in different parts of the world, each failing to match the success of "Bad Day". "Free Loop" was deemed chart ineligible in the UK (as the release included a version of "Bad Day" as a B-side whilst "Bad Day" was still in the chart, hence breaking chart rules) and failed to chart in the U.S., though it reached the top forty on the Adult Contemporary chart. Following the release of "Lie to Me", "Jimmy Gets High" was to be the fourth single from the album in the UK, but its release was cancelled. A new track called "[[Love You Lately]]" was released as the next U.S. single, preceding a re-release of the album ''Daniel Powter'' that was also cancelled. Powter was never able to have another major hit after "Bad Day" and never cracked the U.S. Hot 100 again.

==Later career (2008–present)==
In March 2008, a song by Japanese singer [[Haru (singer)|Haru]] featuring Powter, "Find My Way", was released. In September, Powter released his third album, ''[[Under the Radar (Daniel Powter album)|Under the Radar]]''. This was the same year in which he embarked on the Wolfbaggin' Tour, joining the likes of [[Alphabeat]] and [[Lil Chris]].

Powter also performed piano on tracks for what was scheduled to be [[Marcy Playground]] frontman [[John Wozniak]]'s solo album, ''[[Leaving Wonderland...in a fit of rage]]'', but the album was released under the band's name.  Powter was still given credit for his contributions to the song "Gin and Money".

On March 16, 2009, Powter performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]] then in December 2009, Powter was named as the decade's top One-Hit Wonder by ''Billboard''.  The magazine describes [[one-hit wonder]]s as acts whose second hit did not reach the top 25; they only included acts from 2000 to 2007.<ref>The Associated Press, December 7, 2009.</ref>  Powter's notoriety is unmistakable, since "Bad Day" is his only Hot 100 hit.

On January 1, 2010, he performed ''O Canada'' at the [[2010 NHL Winter Classic|NHL Winter Classic]]. In that same year, he released his greatest hits album, ''Best of Me'', and with it, recorded three new songs and a new version of the title track to go along with 'Bad Day', 'Jimmy Gets High', 'Next Plane Home' and his other singles. Only one was released as a single: 'Lose To Win', on November 10, 2010.

On December 1, 2010, Powter made a tribute to English singer and songwriter [[John Lennon]] with his cover version of [[Happy Xmas (War Is Over)]]. This single was released in Europe, the UK and Japan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Daniel-Powter-Happy-Xmas-War-Is-Over/release/6700495|title=Daniel Powter - Happy Xmas (War Is Over)|website=Discogs}}</ref>

Powter again failed to re-capture the success of "Bad Day." In 2011, he took a hiatus.

On April 10, 2012, Powter's new single "[[Cupid (Daniel Powter song)|Cupid]]" was released to US and Canadian iTunes stores. Powter's latest album, ''[[Turn on the Lights (album)|Turn on the Lights]]'', was released in July 2012.

On June 13, 2012, Powter also made a tribute to [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]] with his variation of the song "[[Stay Away (L'Arc-en-Ciel song)|Stay Away]]".

On September 10, 2012, he released "Crazy All My Life".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://music.apple.com/ua/album/crazy-all-my-life-single/595654348|title=Crazy All My Life single|date=10 September 2012}}</ref>

On December 5, 2012, Powter was featured in a song with Japanese singer [[May J.]] titled "Back To Your Heart". On the 18 he released the single "Christmas Cupid", which is a Christmas version of his song "Cupid".

On June 5, 2013, Powter announced on Twitter that he was working on a new album with Jeff Dawson, who co-produced most of his songs in the past, and John Fields, who was a co-writer on "Crazy All My Life". He also said:<blockquote>I'm writing like I did during the first record. I'm not focusing on singles. Otherwise I would try too hard and end up with garbage sort of like Bad Day. I never thought in my wildest dreams that it was a single. I think that's what writing from your heart is. Just like anything else. When you try too hard, it really isn't worthy of anything... So I stay open and just let the songs write themselves.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/dpowtermusic/status/342270903507353600 | title=5 June tweet 1|website=Twitter.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/dpowtermusic/status/342271313047601153| title=5 June tweet 2|website=Twitter.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://twitter.com/dpowtermusic/status/342271551309225984 | title=5 June tweet 3|website=Twitter.com}}</ref></blockquote>

Powter disclosed in July 2013 that he was [[Child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] by a female babysitter for three years starting from age 7 and turned to drugs and alcohol to get over his guilt and shame. He said in an interview<blockquote>I thought that (addiction) was my problem. But it wasn’t. That was my solution. It wasn't until I started digging in, taking a look at myself, saying I gotta work on some stuff (that) I don’t want to look at (that I figured it out). My parents didn't know and I was too scared to tell them.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/musicnews/daniel-powter-305283.html| title=Daniel Powter was sexually abused as a child|website=Femalefirst.co.uk}}</ref></blockquote>

==Musical Influences==
Powter spoken of his musical influences growing up<blockquote>My favourite is [[Nick Drake]]. I absolutely adore his music. You know it's still old band music inspired by [[Elton John]]'s old stuff, you know [[The Beatles]] and [[Fleetwood Mac]] and [[David Bowie]] and the things that my parents gave me when I was a kid. I still listen to those records, because I think for me, what it is that I relate to, is how the structure of the songs are for them, you know, like verses, and choruses, and bridges. And so sometimes the modern music that I hear these days doesn't really have that and I don't relate to it. So I still listen to the old stuff.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gettyimages.com.br/detail/v%C3%ADdeo/daniel-powter-on-music-he-listens-to-at-daniel-filmagem-de-not%C3%ADcias/148659131|title=Daniel Powter on music he listens to|website=www.gettyimages.com.br/}}</ref></blockquote>
