'''Glass Animals''' are a British [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Oxford]] in 2010. Led by singer, songwriter, and producer Dave Bayley, the group also features his childhood friends Joe Seaward, Ed Irwin-Singer and Drew MacFarlane. Bayley wrote and produced all three Glass Animals albums. The first, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'' (2014), spawned the single "[[Gooey (song)|Gooey]]", which was eventually certified platinum in the United States. Their second full album, ''[[How to Be a Human Being]]'', received generally positive reviews and won in two categories at the 2018 MPG Awards for UK Album of the Year and Self Producing Artist of the Year, as well as a spot on the [[Mercury Prize]] shortlist. The third, ''[[Dreamland (Glass Animals album)|Dreamland]]'', their first fully autobiographical album (Bayley had said he felt it was selfish to write about oneself), included the single "Tokyo Drifting" which peaked at number seven on the ''Billboard'' Alternative Songs chart.

In their live shows they play re-worked, dance-heavy versions of their songs. Their song "[[Heat Waves (song)|Heat Waves]]" reached number one in Australia in February 2021 and was voted number one on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2020|Triple J Hottest 100 of 2020]]. Glass Animals earned their first [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] nomination in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category at the [[2022 Grammy Awards]].

== History ==

=== 2012–2015: ''Zaba'' and various EPs  ===
[[File:Glass Animals - James Lavelle's Meltdown.jpg|thumb|Glass Animals performing in 2014]]
The band released their debut EP, ''Leaflings'', on 28 May 2012, which included the single "Cocoa Hooves". The EP was released on independent label Kaya Kaya Records, a subsidiary and imprint of [[XL Recordings]] (part of the [[Beggars Group]] of labels). At the time, lead singer and guitarist Dave Bayley was attending medical school at King's College, London but left after [[Adele]]'s producer [[Paul Epworth]] saw Glass Animals performing in London and signed them to his label Wolf Tone.

In 2013, the band released ''Black Mambo / Exxus EP'' in Europe, and ''Glass Animals EP'' in the US. The digital release of the track "Black Mambo" brought the band their first attention through online reviews.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|title=Black Mambo|website=Hype Machine|access-date=15 November 2019|archive-date=18 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180918012251/https://hypem.com/track/1wegy/Glass+Animals+-+Black+Mambo|url-status=live}}</ref> The ''Glass Animals'' EP also saw the band collaborating with Jean Deaux, a soulful hip-hop teenager from Chicago, on a song titled "Woozy".

In 2014, the band made their first visit to the US, performing at ''[[South by Southwest]]'' in Austin, Texas. They released three more singles: "Pools", "Gooey", and "Hazey", along with a collaboration with Argentine singer-songwriter and producer [[Tei Shi]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

All five singles were included on the band's debut album, ''[[Zaba (album)|Zaba]]'', which was released on 6 June 2014. The band performed the single "Gooey" on ''[[Late Night with Seth Meyers]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals Get "Gooey" Again on Late Night With Seth Meyers {{!}} The Lefort Report|url = http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|website = www.thelefortreport.com|access-date = 21 January 2016|archive-date = 28 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160128095212/http://www.thelefortreport.com/blog/2014-10/watch-glass-animals-get-gooey-again-on-late-night-with-seth-meyers/|url-status = live}}</ref> in 2014, and again on ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|The Late Show]]'' with [[David Letterman]]<ref>{{Cite web|title = Watch Glass Animals play 'Gooey' on Letterman|url = http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|website = DIY|access-date = 21 January 2016|archive-date = 26 January 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160126163646/http://diymag.com/2015/02/26/watch-glass-animals-play-gooey-on-letterman|url-status = live}}</ref> on 24 February 2015, and toured extensively after ''Zaba'', visiting both hemispheres and played over 130 shows in 2015 alone. Their October 2015 US tour included two sold-out shows at The Wiltern in LA and sold-out shows across America including T5 in NYC, The Riverside in Milwaukee, and the [[Midland Theatre]] in [[Kansas City]].

A collaboration with American rapper [[Joey Badass|Joey Bada$$]], titled "Lose Control", was released on 6 October 2015.

The band also created a website based on the character from "Life Itself".

On 25 July, a second single from the album, "Youth", was released along with its music video.<ref name=":0" /> This song was also used as a soundtrack in the popular football video game by [[EA Sports]], ''[[FIFA 17]]''. Four days before the release of the album, on 22 August, the band released a third single, "Season 2 Episode 3", about a girl who "spends her entire time watching TV, lounging around, not doing anything, being high, eating mayonnaise from a jar".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://howlandechoes.com/2016/08/interview-photo-shoot-glass-animals/|title=Glass Animals, Human Beings: Interview & Photos • Howl & Echoes|date=2016-08-26|newspaper=Howl & Echoes|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-16|archive-date=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118032700/http://howlandechoes.com/2016/08/interview-photo-shoot-glass-animals/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The full album ''How to Be a Human Being'' was released on 26 August 2016 by Wolf Tone and [[Caroline International]] in Europe, and [[Harvest Records]] in the United States. The album received critical acclaim for its "sense of wonder" and "immediate impression", though it was also met with some mixed reactions, for critics felt that it was somewhat premature. They played [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival|Laneway Festivals]] in six different cities (Singapore, Sydney, and Auckland, among others). During their time in Australia, their three singles from ''How to Be a Human Being''—"Youth", "Life Itself", and "Season 2 Episode 3", respectively—came in at 38, 63 and 98 on [[Triple J Hottest 100, 2016|Triple J's Hottest 100]].{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In July 2018, drummer Joe Seaward was seriously injured when he was hit by a [[lorry]] while cycling in [[Dublin]]. Seaward's accident and recovery resulted in the band cancelling their remaining tour dates for rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Glass Animals Cancel Tour After Drummer Hit by Truck {{!}} Pitchfork |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/glass-animals-cancel-tour-after-drummer-hit-by-truck/ |website=pitchfork.com |access-date=15 July 2018 |language=en |archive-date=27 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201227094723/https://pitchfork.com/news/glass-animals-cancel-tour-after-drummer-hit-by-truck/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
