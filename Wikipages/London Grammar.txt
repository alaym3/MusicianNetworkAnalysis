==History==

===2009–2012: Early career===
Vocalist Hannah Reid and guitarist Dan Rothman are originally from London<ref name="reidonsexism">{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/music/london-grammar-singer-hannah-reid-on-sexism-in-the-music-industry-8957594.html|work=London Evening Standard|author=David Smyth|title=London Grammar singer Hannah Reid on sexism in the music industry|date=22 November 2013|quote=Reid is from the Acton area and Rothman from Hendon}}</ref> and met in the Ancaster Hall of residence at the [[University of Nottingham]] during their first year in 2009. Rothman saw that Reid played the guitar and contacted her to see if she wanted to collaborate. They were joined by [[Northampton]] native Dominic 'Dot' Major (keyboard, [[djembe]], drums) a year later, after he began playing music together with Rothman.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}<!-- WP:RS needed; removed link to WP:SPS (Twitter, FB, WP)--> They chose the name as "not only was it where we're from, but London is also so international and multicultural that it actually felt like quite a universal name in a way."<ref name=reidonsexism/>

After completing their studies in mid-2010, the trio moved down to London to pursue a career in music. By the end of the year they were managed by Conor Wheeler who began promoting them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/daniel-rothman/37/b81/53b?trk=pub-pbmap|title=Dan Rothman Linkedin entry|quote=Notes that he graduated in 2011 with a BA in Economics and philosophy|publisher=LinkedIn}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://uk.linkedin.com/pub/conor-wheeler/4a/592/88a|title=Conor Wheeler Linkedin entry|quote=Details his period as a manager for the band from December 2011 to June 2012|publisher=LinkedIn}}</ref> The band began by playing low-key gigs at local bars, honing their material.<ref name= 20130422theguardian/><ref name=":1"/> They soon found themselves noticed by a number of [[A&R]] people, and they were signed with the [[Ministry of Sound]] while Big Life took over the management duties in the second half of 2013.<ref name="Argus: Great Escape"/> In the same year the trio did some early recordings with [[Rollo Armstrong]] of [[Faithless]] and Liam Howe of [[Sneaker Pimps]].<ref>{{cite web|title=London Grammar Interview|url=http://www.bristolbeatsclub.com/podcasts/on-tour-in-bristol/london-grammar-interview|website=Bristol Beats Club|access-date=23 June 2014}}</ref> Later in the year, the band continued to work with Tim Bran of [[Dreadzone]] and [[The Freelance Hellraiser|Roy Kerr]], and by the end of the year most of the recording had been completed. On 12 November 2012, the trio posted their song "[[Hey Now (London Grammar song)|Hey Now]]" on YouTube; it immediately received a huge amount of attention.<ref name="DIY Space Interview">{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisfakediy.co.uk/articles/features/london-grammar-space-is-the-answer/|author=Huw Oliver|title=London Grammar: Space is the answer|work=DIY Magazine|date=4 September 2013}}</ref>
