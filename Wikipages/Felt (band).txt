The band's name was inspired by [[Tom Verlaine]]'s emphasis of the word "felt" in the [[Television (band)|Television]] song "[[Marquee Moon|Venus]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/felt-forever-breathes-the-lonely-word/|title=Felt: Forever Breathes the Lonely Word|first=Quinn|last=Moreland|date=26 May 2019|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]}}</ref>

== History ==
=== Formation ===
[[Lawrence (musician)|Lawrence]] founded the band in 1979 with the release of the single "Index", a self-published solo recording.<ref name="mojo">{{cite journal | title=Tales of Ordinary Madness | first=Ian | last=Harrison | journal=[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]] | date=May 2012 | pages=58}}</ref> A noisy effort unlike Felt's subsequent records,<ref name="mg">{{cite journal | title = Felt Biography | journal = Musician Guide | url = http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608002877/Felt.html}}</ref> it was later awarded single of the week by Dave McCullough in music newspaper ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.<ref name="gilbert"/>

With Lawrence initially on vocals and guitar, they formed properly in 1980 with the addition of schoolfriend Nick Gilbert on drums and local guitarist [[Maurice Deebank]].<ref name="gilbert"/><ref name="mg"/> Becoming co-writer with Lawrence, Deebank's [[Jangle|jangly]], classical-influenced style of playing would provide the band's signature sound in its early years.<ref name="amoeba">{{cite journal | title =  Felt Biography | journal = [[Amoeba Music]] | url = http://www.amoeba.com/music/artist/143627/bio}}</ref>

The band performed as a trio before deciding that bass guitar was needed. Gilbert switched to bass and drummer Tony Race was added.<ref name="gilbert"/> He was replaced soon after by Gary Ainge who would remain the only constant member besides Lawrence throughout the rest of Felt's existence, as well as the only member to play on all ten of their albums.<ref>{{cite web | first=Jason | last=Ankeny | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/felt-mn0000795341/biography%% | title=Felt{{snd}}Biography | website=[[AllMusic]]  | access-date=8 April 2021}}</ref>

=== Signing ===
Felt signed to [[Cherry Red Records]] and their first single as a band, "Something Sends Me to Sleep", was released in 1981. Their first album, ''[[Crumbling the Antiseptic Beauty]]'', followed the next year. Gilbert left and was replaced on bass by Mick Lloyd.<ref name="mg"/> The band's lineup would then remain unchanged through their next two albums, ''[[The Splendour of Fear]]'' and ''[[The Strange Idols Pattern and Other Short Stories]]''. In 1982, the Felt song "My Face Is on Fire" appeared on the bestselling ''[[Pillows & Prayers]]'' compilation.

In 1985, for the recording of their fourth album, keyboard player [[Martin Duffy (musician)|Martin Duffy]] was added and Marco Thomas became bassist.<ref>{{cite magazine | last = McFadden | first = Lee | title = Felt | magazine = [[Perfect Sound Forever (magazine)|Perfect Sound Forever]] | url = http://www.furious.com/perfect/felt.html}}</ref> ''[[Ignite the Seven Cannons]]'' was produced by [[Robin Guthrie]] of the [[Cocteau Twins]] and featured [[Elizabeth Fraser]] on the single "Primitive Painters". The song reached the top of the UK independent singles chart.

Deebank departed soon after, prompting a shift in Felt's sound with Duffy's keyboards becoming more central. The lead guitar position would subsequently be filled by an ever-changing succession of players.<ref name="amoeba"/>

The band moved to [[Creation Records]] in 1986 and released ''[[Let the Snakes Crinkle Their Heads to Death]]'', the first of two instrumental albums they would record. Their next album, ''[[Forever Breathes the Lonely Word]]'', was a conventional collection of songs that gained the band praise and would become regarded by many as their best.<ref>{{cite journal | last = MacBain | first = Hamish | title = Forever Breathes the Lonely Word | journal = [[NME]] | date = 1 January 2011 | url = http://pub27.bravenet.com/photocenter/viewimg.php?usernum=2284341502&show=7E986B7360.jpg}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last = McGee | first = Alan | title = Lawrence: the pop star who relished failure | journal = [[The Guardian]] | date = 10 December 2007 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/dec/10/lawrencethepopstarwhoreli}}</ref>

=== Break up and later ===
In 1989, Lawrence declared it had been his intention all along to release ten singles and ten albums in ten years and, having done so, announced the end of Felt.<ref name="mojo"/><ref>{{cite magazine | last=Black | first=Johnny |title=Where Are They Now? | magazine=[[Q magazine|Q]] | date=October 2002 | page=61 | url=https://felt3.home.sapo.pt/q.jpg | url-status=bot: unknown | archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100610010403/http://felt3.home.sapo.pt/q.jpg | archive-date=10 June 2010 | df=dmy }}</ref> After releasing their last album, ''[[Me and a Monkey on the Moon]]'', and undertaking a short tour, the band split up. Lawrence went on to form [[Denim (band)|Denim]] and later, [[Go Kart Mozart]]. Duffy joined [[Primal Scream]]. Ainge would later play with [[Vic Godard]]. Mick Lloyd died in 2016. Subsequent bass player Mick Bund died in 2017.

In 2018, [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]] reissued all ten Felt albums<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thefeltdecade.com |website=thefeltdecade.com |title=Felt: A Decade In Music |access-date=8 September 2020}}</ref> on CD and vinyl, with new mixes of songs plus revised tracklistings and packaging.
