'''Bill Wurtz''' (stylized in [[lower case]] as '''bill wurtz''' or '''billwurtz''') is an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and [[YouTuber]] based in [[New York City]]. He is known for his distinctive musical, comedic, and narrative style which includes [[deadpan]] delivery and singing paired with colorful [[Surrealism|surrealist]], [[Psychedelic art|psychedelic]], and [[Non sequitur (literary device)|non-sequitur]] graphics.

Wurtz first published material on [[YouTube]] in 2013. He set up a website in 2014, presenting a catalog of music and videos he had created since 2002. Wurtz proceeded to upload edited versions of his videos on [[Vine (service)|Vine]], where he gained his initial popularity. He experienced breakout success on YouTube with his animated videos, ''history of japan'' (2016), and ''history of the entire world, i guess'' (2017). Wurtz released music videos regularly from 2017 to March 2019. Through the rest of 2019 and all of 2020, Wurtz was inactive on YouTube, revamping his setup for video creation, but returned to the platform in January 2021 with a new visual style of 3D animation.

=== ''history of japan''{{anchor|history of japan}} ===
Alongside interest on Vine, Wurtz achieved wider popularity in 2016 with ''history of japan'', a nine-minute YouTube video that outlines [[History of Japan|Japan's history]].<ref name="inverse" /> The video covers key events of its history: "[[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhism]], internal conflict, [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|alliances with Britain]], [[World War I]], [[World War II]], the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|dropping of atomic bombs]] and its [[Japanese economic miracle|post-war economic miracle]]".<ref name="huffington">{{cite web|first=Lee|last=Moran|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/history-of-japan-video_us_56b85b2fe4b04f9b57da2fcc|title=WATCH: Trippy Video Teaches The Entire History Of Japan In Just 9 Minutes|date=February 8, 2016|website=[[HuffPost]]|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref> It showcases Wurtz's quirky visual and comedic style through a mixture of fast-paced narration and animation, intercut with short musical jingles.

Writer German Lopez for the news website ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' called it a "strange", "pretty good – and surprisingly funny" video. Nevertheless, Lopez noted the poor coverage of [[Japanese war crimes]] committed against Korea and China in the 20th century, particularly the [[Nanjing Massacre]] and the use of [[Comfort women|Korean sex slaves]], and attributed this omission to the video's short runtime.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lopez|first=German|title=The most bizarre, entertaining history of Japan you'll ever watch|work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|url=https://www.vox.com/2016/2/3/10905274/japan-history-video|date=May 18, 2017|access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref> Wurtz has responded to these criticisms on his questions page, suggesting to viewers to look for other YouTube channels that cover these topics.<ref group="q">{{cite web|last=Wurtz|first=Bill|title=[...] Why have you glossed over the atrocities Japan has committed, which are major events in Japan's history?

=== Music videos ===
