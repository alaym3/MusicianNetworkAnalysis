Mansionz was formed when longtime collaborators [[Blackbear (musician)|Matthew Musto]] and [[Mike Posner]] formally came together as a musical duo in late 2016. At that time, the two musicians were already good friends and had worked together multiple times in the past on singles such as [[Justin Bieber|Justin Bieber's]] [[Boyfriend (Justin Bieber song)|"Boyfriend,"]] as well as several of their own tracks. On December 9, 2016, Musto and Posner released their debut single under the name Mansionz, entitled "Stfu." The track features rapper [[Spark Master Tape]] and has been described as a "slow R&B serenade".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ventsmagazine.com/2016/12/09/mansionz-drops-debut-single-stfu-featuring-spark-master-tape-today/ |title=Mansionz Drops Debut Single "Stfu" Featuring Spark Master Tape Today! |website=Ventsmagazine.com |date= 9 December 2016|accessdate=2020-04-17}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=mansionz (Ft.
