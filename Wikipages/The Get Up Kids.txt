'''The Get Up Kids''' are an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Kansas City, Missouri]]. Formed in 1995, the band was a major player in the mid-1990s [[Midwest emo]] scene, otherwise known as the "[[Emo#1994–1997: Underground popularity|second wave]]" of emo music. As they gained prominence, they began touring with bands such as [[Green Day]] and [[Weezer]] before becoming headliners themselves, eventually embarking on international tours of [[Japan]] and [[Europe]].<ref name="Lazy-I">{{cite news|last=McMahan |first=Tim |title=The Get Up Kids |url=http://www.timmcmahan.com/getup.htm |newspaper=[[The Omaha Weekly]]|date=2002-12-11 |access-date=2008-03-02}}</ref><ref name="rollingstone">{{cite magazine|last=Edwards |first=Gavin |title=The Get Up Kids Get Up |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thegetupkids/articles/story/5937851/the_get_up_kids_get_up |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2002-08-05 |access-date=2008-03-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071230070221/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thegetupkids/articles/story/5937851/the_get_up_kids_get_up |archive-date = December 30, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> They founded Heroes & Villains Records, an imprint of the successful indie rock label [[Vagrant Records]]. While the imprint was started to release albums by The Get Up Kids, it served as a launching pad for several side-projects such as [[The New Amsterdams]] and [[Reggie and the Full Effect]].<ref name="aversion">{{Cite web|last=Schild |first=Matt |title=Get Up, Stand Up |url=http://www.aversion.com/bands/interviews.cfm?f_id=36 |website=Aversion.com|date=1999-09-06 |access-date=2008-03-02}}</ref>

Their second album ''[[Something to Write Home About]]'' remains their most widely acclaimed album, and is considered to be one of the quintessential albums of the second-wave emo movement.<ref name="Nothing Feels Good">{{Cite book|last=Greenwald |first=Andy |title=[[Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-312-30863-9}}</ref> Like many early emo bands, The Get Up Kids sought to dissociate themselves from the term "emo."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Heller |first=Greg |title=Bands Seek Emotional Rescue |url=http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Bands-Seek-Emotional-Rescue-Young-postpunk-2705961.php |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=2000-09-10 |access-date=2008-03-02}}</ref> The band departed heavily from their established style with the release of their 2002 album ''[[On a Wire]]'', which saw the band take on a much more layered, alternative rock sound. Years later, guitarist Jim Suptic even apologized for having the influence they did on many of the modern third-wave emo bands, commenting that "[t]he punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like glam rock now ...

Due to internal conflicts, the band broke up in 2005. Three years later, the band reunited to support the tenth anniversary re-release of ''Something to Write Home About'', and soon afterward entered the studio to write new material.<ref name="New Material">{{cite magazine |title=The Get Up Kids Writing New Material |url=http://www.rocksound.tv/news/article/the-get-up-kids-writing-new-material |magazine=[[Rock Sound]] |date=2009-08-19 |access-date=2009-08-20}}</ref> In early 2010, the band released ''[[Simple Science]]'', their first release in six years, followed in 2011 by the full-length ''[[There Are Rules]]''.

== History ==
=== Early years (1995–1997) ===
[[File:TGUK Emos.png|thumb|right|The Get Up Kids performing at [[Emo's]] in 1997]]
While in high school, [[Ryan Pope (musician)|Ryan Pope]], [[Rob Pope]], and [[Jim Suptic]] formed a short-lived band called Kingpin. [[Matt Pryor (musician)|Matt Pryor]] had been writing songs since he was a teenager, and was playing in a band called Secret Decoder Ring.<ref>{{Cite news|title= POP AND JAZZ GUIDE |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C06E3D7133FF937A25751C1A9679C8B63 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-12-14 |access-date=2008-03-02}}</ref> Following the demise of the two bands in 1995, The Get Up Kids were formed. The band originally planned on calling themselves "The Suburban Get Up Kids", until reasoning that there were fewer band names beginning with the letter 'G' than there are with the letter 'S', and that therefore they were more likely to be noticed in a record store if their name began with a 'G'.<ref name="rollingstone"/> The band was formed on October 14, 1995 on Suptic's 18th birthday.<ref name="Post">{{Cite book|last=Grubbs |first=Eric |title=Post: A Look at the Influence of Post-Hardcore-1985-2007 |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |year=2008 |pages=224–266 |isbn=978-0-595-51835-7}}</ref>

At the time the lineup consisted of Pryor on guitar and lead vocals, Suptic on guitar, Rob Pope on bass, and Thomas Becker on drums. However, Becker soon left for college in California, and was replaced by Nathan Shay, who was attending school with Suptic at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]].<ref name="Post" /> In 1995, Pryor, Suptic, and friend Kevin Zelko saved money to self-release "[[Shorty/The Breathing Method]]", their first [[7-inch]]. However, due to an unwillingness to tour, Shay was replaced by Robert's younger brother Ryan in April 1996.<ref name="history"/> The band became increasingly popular in the burgeoning underground Midwestern music scene, forming strong relationships with bands such as [[Rocket Fuel Is The Key]], [[Coalesce (band)|Coalesce]] and [[Braid (band)|Braid]]. After the "Shorty" 7-inch, the band released "[[A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts]]" on Contrast Records.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Conoley |first=Ben |title=Vinyl File: Sex Pistols, the Draft, F*cked Up, Coliseum and a Get Up Kids spotlight |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/24898 |website=Punknews.org|date=2007-08-01 }}</ref> Encouraged by interest stirred by the band's first 7-inch, they recorded their first EP, ''[[Woodson (EP)|Woodson]]''. Two songs of which were released by Contrast Records as a 7-inch titled "A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts" or more commonly known as "The Loveteller 7", with [[Doghouse Records]] releasing a CD-EP version which included the songs from both ''Woodson'' and ''A Newfound Interest in Massachusetts''<ref name="Post" />  as well as the two song ''Woodson'' 7".  After ''Woodson'', Doghouse approached the band with a two-album contract, offering them $4,000 to record their first full-length album.<ref name="Post" />

=== ''Four Minute Mile'' (1997–1998) ===
After signing to Doghouse, the band drove to Chicago to record their debut full-length album with producer [[Bob Weston]] of [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]]. The album was recorded in only two days, with the band leaving on Friday after Ryan Pope got out of school and finishing in the early hours of Sunday morning.<ref name="history" /> Two months after recording the album, the band embarked on their first national tour with [[Braid (band)|Braid]] and [[Ethel Meserve]] with the first date of the tour taking place the day after Ryan's high school graduation.<ref name="Post" />

It was on that tour that the band met [[James Dewees]], the new drummer for [[Coalesce (band)|Coalesce]] while the bands were playing together in [[Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania|Wilkes-Barre]], [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name="Post" /> After the show, the members of the two bands became close friends, eventually leading them to record a [[Split album|split 7-inch]] produced by [[Ed Rose]] entitled "[[The Get Up Kids / Coalesce]]". For the split, each band covered one of the other's songs in their own style. Coalesce did a post-hardcore cover of "Second Place", and The Get Up Kids recorded a power-pop rendition of "Harvest of Maturity".<ref name="Post" />

A few months later, the band released their debut full-length record ''[[Four Minute Mile]]'', bringing a great deal of attention from critics, fans and labels alike. The band was invited to join Braid on their 1998 tour of Europe and the band rapidly created an overseas fanbase.<ref name="Post" />

While the band was receiving rapidly increasing national and international attention, they became unhappy with Doghouse Records' ability to keep up with the increasing popularity of the band.<ref name="history" /> The Get Up Kids' announcement to leave Doghouse Records brought interest from prominent record labels including [[Sub Pop]], [[Geffen Records|Geffen]] and [[Mojo Records]].<ref name="history" /> The band made a decision to sign to Mojo, but before the contracts were signed, they began to have second thoughts. The main issue was over the label's insistence on owning merchandising rights, a large source of the band's income.<ref name="Post" /> Moreover, the band was insulted the label requested they re-record "Don't Hate Me" from ''Four Minute Mile'' for their next record, feeling that the label believed it was "the best that [they could] write".<ref name="history" /> Before the deal with Mojo was official, the band met Rich Egan, founder of Los Angeles-based [[Vagrant Records]]. He convinced the band to sign to Vagrant instead, offering them $50,000 to record a second album, as well as their own imprint, Heroes & Villains Records.<ref name="Post" />

=== ''Something to Write Home About'' (1999–2001) ===
[[File:TGUK Bowry.png|thumb|left|The Get Up Kids performing at the [[Bowery Ballroom]] in 2000]]
In 1998, James Dewees recorded his first solo album under the pseudonym [[Reggie and the Full Effect]]. While Dewees wrote the songs himself, he asked Matt Pryor and Rob Pope to help record some of the instrumentals. The resulting album, [[Greatest Hits 1984-1987]] leaned heavily on the use of synthesizer keyboards for its sound. Their work together on the Reggie and the Full Effect album led Pryor to invite Dewees to collaborate with The Get Up Kids on ''[[Red Letter Day (EP)|Red Letter Day]]'', a five-track EP produced by Ed Rose to fulfill their two-record deal with Doghouse. The cleaner, more focused sound of the EP provided the chance to experiment with the inclusion of keyboards and acts as a sonic bridge between the raw sound of ''Four Minute Mile'' and the more dynamic, produced style of their next studio album.<ref name="Post" />

After the release of ''Red Letter Day'', Dewees became a full-time member as the band began recording their second studio album in [[Los Angeles]] in June 1999 with producer Alex Brahl. Before the album went into production, [[Vagrant Records]] co-owner [[John Cohen (musician)|John Cohen]] borrowed money from his parents, who had mortgaged their house in order to fund the production of the album. On September 21, 1999, the band released ''[[Something to Write Home About]]'' on Vagrant Records. The album's lyrics reflected the record label strife the band had experienced and their distance between friends and family back home after their move to Los Angeles.<ref name="Post" /> ''Something to Write Home About'' has been singled out as the band's only 'true' emo album, as the album's aesthetic fit more into the contemporary definition of the genre.<ref name="rsag">{{Cite book |last=Brackett |first=Nathan |author-link=Nathan Brackett |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]] |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/330 330] |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/330 }}</ref> Furthermore, the album single-handedly turned the struggling Vagrant label into one of the top [[independent record label|indie label]]s in the country, selling over 140,000 copies after its release.<ref name="Post" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Aubin |title=About Vagrant Records |url=http://www.punknews.org/labels/vagrant |website=Punknews.org|access-date=2008-03-02}}</ref> Not only did the album make The Get Up Kids the poster children for emo, but it also launched the genre into a public consciousness broader than the scattered local scenes that had previously embraced it. The album gave Vagrant Records the financial backing to grow and sign a string of other bands. At the same time, the addition of keyboards alienated some fans who thought it moved the band away from the contemporary punk scene's [[DIY]] ethic.<ref name="aversion"/><ref name="Essential Guide">{{Cite web|last=Reid |first=Sean |title=An Essential Guide To: The Get Up Kids |url=http://www.alterthepress.com/2009/08/feature-essential-guide-to-get-up-kids.html |publisher=Alter the Press |date=2009-08-17 |access-date=2009-08-20}}</ref>

The Get Up Kids toured relentlessly for almost three years in promotion of the record.<ref name="Decapolis">{{Cite web|last=Harlow |first=Luke |title=Rob Pope of The Get Up Kids |url=http://www.decapolis.com/musicreviews/interviews/getupkid.shtml |publisher=Decapolis |date= 2000-09-02 |access-date=2009-06-02}}</ref> As well as touring Europe, Japan, and Australia, they shared bills with acts such as [[Green Day]], [[The Anniversary]], [[Hot Rod Circuit]], [[Jebediah]], [[Weezer]] and [[Ozma (band)|Ozma]].<ref name="God">{{Cite book |last=Van Pelt |first=Doug |title=Rock Stars on God |publisher=Relevant Media Group |year=2004 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rockstarsongod0000vanp/page/123 123–128] |isbn=0-9729276-9-7 |url=https://archive.org/details/rockstarsongod0000vanp/page/123 }}</ref> Their 2000 tour with [[The Anniversary]] and [[Koufax (band)|Koufax]] was sponsored by [[Napster]].<ref name="Post" /> Their fanbase kept expanding through word of mouth. Venues booked months in advance could no longer hold the demand by the time the band arrived in town and fans were forced to stand outside to see them perform.<ref name="Post" /> To capitalize on anticipation for the band's next album, Vagrant Records released a rarities compilation ''[[Eudora (album)|Eudora]]'' in 2001.<ref name="history" /> ''Eudora'' consisted of alternate takes, covers, and B-sides since the band's formation. Likewise, Doghouse released a re-mastered edition of ''Four Minute Mile'' and a compilation entitled ''The EPs: Woodson and Red Letter Day'', combining the two Doghouse-owned EPs on one [[compact disc]].

=== ''On a Wire'' (2002–2003) ===
After three years of touring for ''Something to Write Home About'', the band was beginning to feel burned-out, and wished to depart from the upbeat power-pop sound with which they had become associated.<ref name="history"/> 
They also began to broaden their musical horizons, taking much greater influence from [[classic rock]] artists like [[Led Zeppelin]]. "Our musical tastes were expanding, and our songwriting reflected that. We were discovering older bands that were new to us," said Pryor in 2021. <ref name="Vagrant 25 Years">{{cite podcast |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-get-up-kids-part-2/id1568066249?i=1000527591109|title= Vagrant Records: 25 Years on the Street - The Get Up Kids pt. 2 |website= https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/vagrant-records-25-years-on-the-street/id1568066249 |publisher=[[Vagrant Records]] |host=[[Matt Pryor (musician)|Matt Pryor]] |date=July 2, 2021 |time= |access-date= November 12, 2021}}</ref> According to Rob Pope, "It was a weird time. We were a bunch of 19, 20, 21 year-old kids...It was this weird formative era where we were challenged by a totally different thing than [[Thurston Moore]] and [[Ian Mackeye]]. "We were all going through our, like bullshit [[The Beatles (band)|Beatles]] phase, and unfortunately we were doing that in public."<ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref>

Speaking to the change in the band's dynamic and artistry around this time, Pryor believes "[Rob & Ryan Pope's] musicianship and the way [they] were, like, locking together took a much more mature jump from ''Something to Write Home About'' to ''On a Wire,'' Jim was starting to become more of a lead guitar player, we were thinking about it more. We were conceptualizing it more." The band spent a great deal more time than in the past demoing songs, eventually sending them to their manager Rich Egan, who was skeptical of the new sound. He told them "You guys can make an art record if you want to, but I'm just saying, this is a drastic turn from your previous material."<ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref>

The band decided to look for a new producer to work with on their third album, wanting to make a more cohesive, "produced" record than their previous material. They put together a list of producers, including [[Stephen Street]] & [[John Leckie]]. The band formally approached [[Nigel Godrich]]  and [[Gil Norton]] with offers, although both declined.<ref name="Post" /> They approached [[Jerry Finn]], citing his work on the [[Superdrag]] album ''[[Head Trip in Every Key]]. <ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref> Finally, the band settled on [[Scott Litt]], best known for his work with [[R.E.M.]], [[The Replacements (band)|The Replacements]] and [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]].<ref name="guiltshow">{{cite magazine|last=Pappademas |first=Alex |title= The Get Up Kids – Guilt Show | url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/get-kids-guilt-show |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=2004-04-19 |access-date=2008-03-02}}</ref> "I remember we were like, 'we want to make the biggest record ever," recalls Rob Pope. "We had it in our heads at that point that we wanted to be on the radio. Scott Litt had a pretty good success rate with that."<ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref>

Litt came to Lawrence, Kansas to do extensive pre-production on the record, before going to Bridgeport, Connecticut in early February for the recording sessions at Litt's suggestion. The album was recorded at Tarquin Studios, with studio owner and later Grammy Award-winning producer [[Peter Katis]] engineering. The band lived in the studio for the duration of the record, recording for four weeks. "It was freezing cold, and I don't think I left a one-block radius very often. It was kind of depressing," said Pope.<ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref> Pryor had to leave after recording for the birth of his daughter, while Rob & Ryan Pope stayed behind to mix the album with Litt and Katis. The process became increasingly contentious, with Litt clashing with the band members. "There were some very questionable decisions in the mixing process. Engineering and tracking with Scott was hard for us, and then mixing with him was like, 'that's the reverb choice you're making on this snare? Which decade are we in?'"<ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref>

The band's third studio album, ''[[On a Wire]]'' was released on May 14, 2002, debuting a more measured, alternative style. Just as ''Something to Write Home About'' alienated some fans with its more produced sound, ''On a Wire'' was criticized by fans who were disappointed with the album's softer musical direction.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Jets to Brazil/Get Up Kids|url=http://spinmagazine.com/reviews/jets-brazilget-kids|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|date=2003-07-21|access-date=2008-03-02|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126053707/http://spinmagazine.com/reviews/jets-brazilget-kids|archive-date=2009-11-26}}</ref> Specifically, the reviewer for ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' wrote "Unfortunately, the visceral energy of their early days is lost in their newfound maturity."<ref>{{Cite journal|date=May 2002 |title="On a Wire" The Get Up Kids |journal=[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]] |issue=August 2002 |page=71 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,249666,00.html |access-date=2009-02-24 }}</ref>

{{Listen|filename=Walking on a Wire sample.ogg|title="Walking on a Wire"|description="Walking on a Wire", from ''On a Wire'' reflects the shift in tone and style from the band's previous works toward a more mature, alternative sound.|format=[[Ogg]]}}

While many fans were upset with this sudden change of direction, the album was generally well received by mainstream publications. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' was highly positive, writing that "This is the group at their best."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carmanica |first=Jon |date=May 2002 |title=The Get Up Kids – "On a Wire" |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |issue=May 31, 2002 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,249666,00.html |access-date=2009-02-24 }}</ref> In his review of the album, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' writer Barry Walters wrote "''On a Wire'' quivers with the anxieties that must have arisen as the Get Up Kids left behind what originally made them. Straining vocals, racing tempos and walls of distortion give way to softer singing, spacious guitars and prominent keyboards . . . The Get Up Kids dig deeper into themselves. What they find is often subtle, less visceral but far more tender."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Walters |first=Barry |date=May 2002 |title=The Get Up Kids: On a Wire |journal=[[Rolling Stone]] |issue=898 |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,249666,00.html |access-date=2009-02-24 }}</ref> 

The poor public reception of the album had a larger impact on the band's popularity as a whole. The band embarked on a tour to promote the album in the late spring soon after the album was released, only to find that they had far less support from both their fans and their record label.<ref name="Post"/> Using the financial and critical success of ''Something to Write Home About'', Vagrant signed several other headlining emo bands such as [[Alkaline Trio]], [[Dashboard Confessional]], and [[Saves the Day]]. The Get Up Kids were no longer the label's top priority, and certainly not after the lukewarm reception of ''On a Wire''.<ref name="Post"/> In an interview with ''Alternative Press'', lead singer Matt Pryor considered the dramatic change in style on ''On a Wire'' seriously dented the momentum the band had built up since ''Something to Write Home About'', allowing later bands such as Dashboard Confessional to take much of the fan base that The Get Up Kids had previously earned.<ref name="history" /> In an interview, Pryor confessed that he did not think that "anyone, including Vagrant, gave that record a chance".<ref name="Post" /> Even though they had avoided the term since its inception, it was at this point the band actively began trying to shed the term "emo", a word that had defined them for years but had come to be associated with more pop-oriented acts. Pryor commented on the album, saying "We really didn't give two shits if anyone liked the record or not, we were really confident that we were going to kill this 'emo' stigma that we had and take the people with open minds with us and leave everyone else in the dust."<ref name="Post" />

In 2021, speaking on their stubbornness, Pryor admitted "I think if anyone told us we were making a bad decision, we would have fired them."<ref name="Vagrant 25 Years"></ref>

=== ''Guilt Show'' (2003–2004) ===
In 2003 the band began recording their fourth studio album. The album would be the first recorded in [[Ed Rose#Black Lodge Studios|Black Lodge Studios]] in [[Eudora, Kansas]], a studio renovated and owned by the Pope brothers and producer Ed Rose. The writing process for the album was different from their past efforts, as most of the songs were written by only three of the band members. In the early stages of writing, Jim Suptic was on his honeymoon. James Dewees was involved in a difficult divorce, and much of his creative efforts inspired by those events went into the fourth [[Reggie and the Full Effect]] album ''[[Songs Not to Get Married To]]''.<ref name="history" /> While this led to a less collaborative effort than in the past, it gave the Pope brothers a more substantial role in writing than ever before. In an interview with ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', Pryor confirmed the song "Never Be Alone" was written by Rob Pope about his 2003 divorce from [[The Anniversary]] keyboardist Adrianne Verhoeven.<ref name="history" />

This fractured approach to the writing process began to strain relationships in the band, at one point leading Suptic to consider quitting the band.<ref name="Post" /> Pryor drew lyrical inspiration from the lives of friends and people he knew, extracting stories of abuse, betrayal and guilt. The album's lyrics also delve into incidents of adultery ("Wouldn't Believe It", "How Long Is Too Long") and the album's first single "The One You Want" is said to be about a woman who Pryor says "Sucks the soul out of people".<ref name="Get all up">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1487005/20040513/get_up_kids.jhtml|title=Get Up Kids Get All Up In Other People's Business|publisher=[[MTV]]|access-date=2009-10-03}}</ref>

In March 2004, the band released their fourth studio album ''[[Guilt Show]]'', produced by Ed Rose. Sonically, the album combined the more measured, sophisticated sound of ''On a Wire'' with the frenetic style of their earlier work.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Caramanica |first=Jon |title=New CDs: Cee-Lo, Get Up Kids |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ceelo/articles/story/5937242/new_cds_ceelo_get_up_kids |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=2004-03-01 |access-date=2008-03-02|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071010134221/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/ceelo/articles/story/5937242/new_cds_ceelo_get_up_kids |archive-date = October 10, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Guilt Show'', which was titled after a misreading of a flier saying "Quilt show", was very well received both critically and commercially.<ref name="Get all up"/><ref name="Album Guide">{{Cite book |last=Brackett |first=Nathan |title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide |publisher=Fireside Books |date=November 2, 2004 |page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/330 330] |edition=4th |isbn=0-7432-0169-8 |url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/330 }}</ref> The more pop-driven tone of the album reunited the band with many fans who were disenchanted after ''On a Wire'', while also staying close enough to the evolution of the last album to interest newer fans and critics.

=== Breakup and solo activity (2004–2008) ===

Over the course of the tour with [[Dashboard Confessional]], relationships between the band members continued to decline.<ref name="history" /> The band's live shows had deteriorated, and Rob and Suptic had both threatened to quit multiple times.<ref name="Post" /> Matt Pryor's wife had recently given birth to their first child, and being away from his family had made him irritable and standoffish.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Matt Pryor: Why He "Quit" The Get Up Kids |url=http://www.lawrence.com/audioclips/147/ |website=Lawrence.com|date=2005-03-15 |access-date=2008-12-09}}</ref> After the Honda Civic tour ended, the band embarked on their world tour, including stops throughout Europe, Japan and Australia. However, their live performance hit an all-time low, with Pryor at times refusing to even sing large portions of songs.<ref name="Post" />

At one tour date in England, the tensions came to a head when Ryan Pope confronted Pryor over his recent despondence, leading to a band meeting where Pryor confessed his desire to reduce his commitment to the rest of the group.<ref name="Post" /> After some discussion, the band agreed that their hearts were no longer in it and at the end of the tour they would quietly end the band.<ref name="ponyboys">{{Cite web|last=Gintowt |first=Robert |title=Stay Gold, Ponyboys |url=http://lawrence.com/news/2005/mar/11/tguk_breakup/ |website=Lawrence.com|date=2005-03-05 |access-date=2007-04-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070125220731/http://www.lawrence.com/news/2005/mar/11/tguk_breakup/ |archive-date=2007-01-25 }}</ref> Once the tour ended, the band went on an unofficial hiatus, not playing as a group until the next January, when they played a show at the [[Granada Theater (Lawrence, Kansas)|Granada Theater]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas]] to celebrate the band's tenth anniversary. The show was recorded and released the following May as the band's first live album, ''[[Live! @ The Granada Theater]]''.

On Tuesday, March 8, 2005, The Get Up Kids announced that after ten years, they were calling it quits.<ref name="ponyboys" /> They embarked on a national farewell tour, ending the band after a sold-out show on July 2, 2005 in their hometown of Kansas City, Missouri at the [[Uptown Theater (Kansas City)|Uptown Theater]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Finn |first=Tim |title=Review: The Get Up Kids |url=http://backtorockville.typepad.com/back_to_rockville/2008/11/schon-vor-zwei.html |newspaper=[[The Kansas City Star|Back to Rockville]] |date=2008-11-17 |access-date=2008-12-09}}</ref>

After the band's split, the Pope brothers took over management of [[Black Lodge Studios]], the recording studio that the band formed with the recording of ''Guilt Show,'' alongside longtime producing partner Ed Rose.

Rob was a founding member of [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], [[Kansas]] group [[White Whale (band)|White Whale]], releasing the 2006 album [[WWI (album)|WWI]] to moderate acclaim<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/music/wwi/white-whale|title=WWI by White Whale|access-date=11 May 2019|website=Metacritic.com}}</ref> before becoming a full-time member of [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]],<ref name="Spoon">{{Cite news|last=Milzoff |first=Rebecca |title=Add Pizza, Beer; Shake Well |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/15/fashion/15nite.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=2007-07-15 |access-date=2009-06-20}}</ref><ref name="Spoonman">{{Cite web|last=Gintowt |first=Richard |title=Spoonman |url=http://www.lawrence.com/news/2007/jul/12/spoonman/ |website=Lawrence.com|date=2007-07-12 |access-date=2009-06-20}}</ref> while Ryan became the drummer for the Lawrence-based experimental rock band The Roman Numerals.

Matt Pryor continued as part of [[The New Amsterdams]], an acoustic alt-country group he had formed in 2000,<ref name="Pros and Cons" /> expanding its sound and solidifying its previously revolving-door lineup. In 2007 he formed [[The Terrible Twos]], a children's band that has released two albums on Vagrant Records.<ref name="Pros and Cons" /> Regarding the decision to make a children's album directly after the split, Pryor said "I wanted to do it anyway because I have kids and I want to write songs for them, but nobody is going to be like 'this isn't as good as the old stuff.' It's immune to punk criticism." In July 2008, he refocused his efforts on a solo career with the release of ''[[Confidence Man (album)|Confidence Man]]'',<ref name="Pros and Cons">{{Cite web|last=Tankard |first=Frank |title=Pros & Cons |url=http://www.lawrence.com/news/2008/jul/21/pros_cons/ |website=Lawrence.com|date=2008-07-21 |access-date=2009-06-20}}</ref> an alt-country release similar in sound to The New Amsterdams. After his second album, [[May Day (Matt Pryor album)|May Day]], Pryor announced that he would be formally disbanding The New Amsterdams in favor of his solo career, concluding the band's tenure with the release of [[Outroduction]], a B-sides recording.

Jim Suptic went on to form [[Blackpool Lights]] with former members of [[Butterglory]] and The Creature Comforts.

Despite their lasting influence on modern music, the band has attempted to disassociate themselves with many of the bands they inspired. Following the band's reformation, guitarist [[Jim Suptic]] undertook an interview with website [[Drowned in Sound]], in which he said, "The punk scene we came out of and the punk scene now are completely different. It's like [[glam rock]] now. We played [[The Bamboozle|the Bamboozle fests]] this year and we felt really out of place... If this is the world we helped create, then I apologise." He went on to say they were grateful for the acknowledgements they have received, though explaining "the problem is most of [the bands they inspired] aren't very good."<ref name="apologise"/>
