'''Have Heart''' was an American [[straight edge]] [[hardcore punk]] band formed in [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]] in 2002. The band recorded a demo that was released in 2003. In 2004, they released the ''What Counts'' EP ([[Think Fast! Records]]), with their debut full-length, ''[[The Things We Carry]]'' ([[Bridge Nine Records]]) arriving in 2006. Their last full-length, ''[[Songs to Scream at the Sun]]'' ([[Bridge Nine Records]]), garnered much critical acclaim from hardcore critics and fans alike, winning 'album of the year' from many hardcore-oriented websites. 

Have Heart's lyrics cover a variety of subjects from the hardcore scene to a much larger scale. Many topics include self-image and its transition to popular media, the straight edge lifestyle, self-control and respect, [[pacifism]], pressure (especially youth pressure), perseverance, self-destruction, friendship, and family. Such lyrical themes have allowed Have Heart to have a commanding force in at least the [[positive hardcore]] scene, and even the scene as a whole.

==History==
Part of the resurgent Boston hardcore scene, Have Heart formed in 2002 around the core lineup of singer Patrick Flynn, guitarist Ryan Hudon, and bassist Ryan Briggs. Hailing from the coastal town of New Bedford, the trio moved to Boston after graduating high school. Initially working with a revolving lineup of local musicians, the band played their first show in July 2003, and in November, their debut demo was released. The demo came to the attention of [[Think Fast! Records]], who signed them for the release of the ''What Counts'' EP in 2004. The EP showcased long-time guitarist Ben Kelly and drummer Justin Paling.

In 2005, Have Heart moved to the estimable hardcore indie [[Bridge Nine Records]] and underwent a lineup change, with Kelly and Paling replaced by Kei Yasui and Shawn Costa, respectively.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thinkfastrecords.com/haveheart |title=Have Heart profile |website=thinkfastrecords.com |access-date=May 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100518173814/http://www.thinkfastrecords.com/haveheart |archive-date=May 18, 2010 }}</ref> The following year they released ''The Things We Carry'', their first full length. In 2007, the band toured through the U.S., Canada and Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bridge9.com/article/18 |title=Have Heart World Tour |date=May 25, 2007 |website=bridge9.com |access-date=May 13, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430124309/http://www.bridge9.com/article/18 |archive-date=April 30, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

In 2008, the band released their second full-length album on Bridge Nine, ''[[Songs to Scream at the Sun]]'', which debuted and peaked at No.&nbsp;193 on the [[Billboard 200]] and No.&nbsp;16 on the [[Top Heatseekers]] chart.<ref name="chart">{{cite magazine |url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=have heart|chart=all}} |title=Songs to Scream at the Sun - Have Heart |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |access-date=May 13, 2010}}</ref>

===2009: Disbandment===
On May 13, 2009, vocalist Patrick Flynn told the world that Have Heart was breaking up after they completed their scheduled world tour, posting a bulletin on the group's [[Myspace]] account:

<blockquote>"Once the Fall rolls around, we can't really do this band the way we would prefer to anymore. Knowing this deadline of ours and having a whole world tour already booked, we'd like to take advantage of the chance to say goodbye to all the people we have met around the world over the years.

So, please come check us out in the remaining months on our little trip around the globe. So far Asia has been a wonderful experience and we're very happy to have had the chance to meet so many kind people and look forward to the rest of Asia.

We will be playing our last show on this year's National Edge Day on October 17, 2009 with a bunch of our friends bands and a sweet guest. It will be somewhere T accessible in the Boston area. It will also be a benefit for a women's shelter in New Bedford, MA, run by my kind mother.

It's been a nice 7 years and we'd like to thank all the unique hardcore kids and bands we have encountered. We have met so many wonderful people who we'll just never forget.

It's been so great. Take care and hope to see you over the next couple months."</blockquote>

The bulletin received over 400 comments from fans after it was posted.

On May 13, Have Heart announced that after finishing their world tour and doing a final show on October 17, 2009 for [[National Edge Day]] in Massachusetts, they will split.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.punknews.org/article/34906 |title=Have Heart announce final show with Bane, Shipwreck a.d. |date=August 22, 2009 |website=punknews.org |access-date=May 13, 2010}}</ref> Their final tour with support from Shipwreck covered every major continent. However, due to a family crisis, Flynn was absent during the first week of shows on the European tour. In this time, Sam Yarmuth from Triple B Records filled in for Flynn, and he rejoined the tour on July 3 in Wiesbaden, Germany. On July 25, 2009, Pat Flynn told the audience during their set on Moshvalleyfest in Belgium that they might release a last EP later that year, though this plan was later scratched. A day later on July 26, they played [[Fluff Fest]] in Czechia.

Bridge Nine Records posthumously released a live recording of Have Heart's final show, titled ''10.17.09'', on November 23, 2010. The release features, in one package, the performance on both CD and DVD.<ref name="punknews-livealbum">{{cite web| last = Paul| first = Aubin| title = Have Heart announced final show CD+DVD| work = Punknews.org| date = September 22, 2010| url = http://www.punknews.org/article/39908| access-date = October 12, 2010}}</ref> Included with ''10.17.09'' was a pamphlet announcing ''We Were Supposed to Stay Young'', an upcoming DVD chronicling the band's career and general scene of the time. Named after lyrics from [[Minor Threat]]'s "Betray", the DVD was set to be released at some point in 2012.

;Final show
Have Heart's final show was played on [[National Edge Day]] 2009 in [[Revere, Massachusetts]], along with other [[straight edge]] bands. Many members of bands presented testimonies of how members from Have Heart had a huge influence on their lives and careers, along with presenting stories of good times shared with members of Have Heart. Have Heart's last performance consisted of songs from all three of their albums and went for roughly one hour. Fans responded strongly, with some even using boogie boards for [[stage diving]]. The last song they played was "Watch Me Rise" from ''[[The Things We Carry]]''. Afterwards, Flynn laid out on the stage and members of the crowd surrounded him onstage cheering and chanting, "Have Heart," along with fans shouting their personal testimonies to the significance Have Heart had on their lives. This lasted for around 20 minutes straight. Patrick Flynn estimated approximately 1500 people attended, whilst Bridge Nine estimated around 2000.

===2010-2014: Post-breakup===
Following the disbandment of Have Heart, Patrick Flynn began working as a history teacher but he and the other members remained active in their local scenes. Flynn and Costa, along with members of [[Dropdead]], Fucking Invinsible, and Voices Forming Weapons, formed the band Sweet Jesus in 2010.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=May 5, 2018|url=https://idioteq.com/sweet-jesus-premieres-another-new-song/|title=Sweet Jesus premieres another new song!|first=Karol |last=Kamiński|publication-date=February 16, 2015 |website=Idioteq.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506020031/https://idioteq.com/sweet-jesus-premieres-another-new-song/|archive-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref> Flynn and Stemper formed the straight edge band Clear and released a demo in 2011.<ref name=noecho>{{cite web|access-date=May 5, 2018|url=http://www.noecho.net/interviews/pat-flynn-free-have-heart-interview|title=Pat Flynn (FREE, Have Heart, Clear, Sweet Jesus, Fiddlehead, Wolf Whistle)|first=Mike |last=Musilli |publication-date=March 5, 2018 |website=NoEcho.net|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180505221025/http://www.noecho.net/interviews/pat-flynn-free-have-heart-interview|archive-date=May 5, 2018}}</ref> Flynn, Costa and members of Basement formed the group Fiddlehead and released their first demo in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=May 5, 2018|url=http://www.punktastic.com/news/new-have-heartbasement-collaboration/|publication-date= October 24, 2014|title=New Have Heart/Basement collaboration|website=Punktastic.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506021827/http://www.punktastic.com/news/new-have-heartbasement-collaboration/|archive-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref>
