== Early career ==
Born in [[Westminster]] to an Italian father<ref>''[[The Graham Norton Show]]'', [[BBC]], 15 January 2016.</ref> and half-German, half-Polish mother, Savoretti grew up in London,<ref>{{cite web|author=Rickard Holmgren |title=Interview with Jack Savoretti |work=Melodic.net |url=http://www.melodic.net/interviewsOne.asp?interviewId=253 |access-date=9 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916000021/http://www.melodic.net/interviewsOne.asp?interviewId=253 |archive-date=16 September 2009 }}</ref> before moving to [[Lugano]], a Swiss city near the Italian border.<ref>{{cite news |title=Singer-songwriters: One vision |work=[[The Independent]] |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/singersongwriters-one-vision-434455.html |access-date=9 July 2009 |date=31 January 2007 }}</ref> Moving around Europe as a child, he ended up at the [[American School in Switzerland]] where he picked up an accent he describes as "transatlantic mutt".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.clashmusic.com/news/premiere-jack-savoretti-back-to-me|title=Premiere: Jack Savoretti - 'Back To Me'|website=Clash Magazine}}</ref>

As a teenager, he was interested only in poetry.<ref>{{cite web |author=Louise McCudden |title=Jack Savorett: ''Harder than Easy'' |url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/reviews/entertainment/music/who-s-next-/jack-savoretti-harder-than-easy-$1311709.htm |access-date=11 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106040705/http://www.inthenews.co.uk/reviews/entertainment/music/who-s-next-/jack-savoretti-harder-than-easy-$1311709.htm |archive-date=6 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> "I was writing all the time, it was the thing to do, sit under a tree with a notebook, go somewhere else in your head. I was in the clouds." When his mother gave him a guitar and suggested he try putting some of his words to music he was "surprised how much more people listen to you when you are singing than if you read a poem". "After that, I couldn't stop, it was constant writing, every day, it became almost a form of conversation, the way I interact with the world."

He began playing guitar at 16.<ref>{{cite web |author=Colin Polonowski |work=CD Times |title=Jack Savoretti – ''Between the Minds'' in March |url=http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4032 |access-date=17 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312020403/http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4032 |archive-date=12 March 2007  }}</ref> Savoretti did two duets with [[Shelly Poole]] called "Anyday Now" and "Hope", both of which appear on [[Shelly Poole|Poole's]] album ''[[Hard Time for the Dreamer]]'', which was released in September 2005.  Jack was signed to De-angelis Productions when he was 18 years of age and subsequently signed to De-angelis Records, a label set up by Anne Barrett and Eric Ramon.  Rick Barraclough joined De-angelis in 2005 and produced the first two albums ''Between the Minds'' and ''Harder than Easy''.  The label contracted Nick Fleming's radio promotions company who introduced Savoretti to Radio 2 where his album ''Between The Minds'' became the album of the week.  De-angelis then flew Savoretti out to the US where Sue Crawshaw, who was working for De-angelis publishing, set up a showcase at Fox film studios, where he performed and quickly became the darling for many film and television supervisors.  During this time the label suggested to the MD of Caffè Nero Paul Ettinger (who had previously seen Jack perform at Tony Moore's venue in Hammersmith) that Jack do a tour of the cafés, becoming the first label to come up with this marketing idea.  Graham Stokes who was consulting for De-angelis suggested that De-angelis should approach the new [[Grammy]] award-winner [[Corinne Bailey Rae]]'s management to have Savoretti as the support act for Corinne's upcoming European tour.  Further to that tour Jack also supported [[Gavin DeGraw]] on a European tour.  Savoretti parted ways with De-angelis in 2010.

== Career ==
=== ''Between the Minds'' (2006–2008) ===
[[File:Jack wiki.jpg|thumb|right|Savoretti performing in 2008.]]
Savoretti released his first single on 9 October 2006, called "[[Without (Jack Savoretti song)|Without]]". The video, filmed in Mallorca was directed by Oscar-nominated director Bobby Garabedian. The single charted at number 90 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] and was B-Listed on [[BBC Radio 2]]. His second single, "Dreamers", was less successful, reaching No. 123 in the UK Singles Chart; it was also playlisted on Radio 2. Savoretti was then spotted by [[Corinne Bailey Rae]], who invited Savoretti to perform with her on her European tour. His album gained support on Radio 2, where it was declared Album of the Week. The album ''[[Between the Minds]]'' was released in March 2007, and it débuted at number 5 on the UK indie charts. On 6 August 2007 he made his television debut on [[GMTV]], where he performed "Dr Frankenstein". Throughout February and March 2008, Savoretti embarked on a solo mini-tour of [[Caffè Nero]] bars in the UK.

After his Caffè Nero tour he re-released his debut album ''Between the Minds'' with a bonus disc with unplugged versions of some of his songs, three new songs, as well as a live cover version of [[Johnny Cash]]'s "[[Ring of Fire (song)|Ring of Fire]]" on 31 March 2008. Four days later, on 4 April 2008, he made another television performance, performing "Gypsy Love" on ''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''.

Savoretti joined Steve Booker (writer of [[Duffy (singer)|Duffy]]'s "[[Mercy (Duffy song)|Mercy]]") to write the A-side to his single, "Gypsy Love", which captures the sincerity of Savoretti's song-writing. Songs such as the A side of his single "One Man Band" are a testament to how he spent the beginning of the year, and an expression of his ability to showcase his voice without the support of a full band.<ref>{{cite web |work=CD Times |title=Jack Savoretti – UK tour in May |url=http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4957 |access-date=26 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212211649/http://www.cdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=4957 |archive-date=12 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Two of his songs featured in series 5 of the hit TV series ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]''. "Between the Minds" was featured in the episode "Cryin' Won't Help You Now", and "No One's Aware" was featured in the episode "What Do You Go Home To?" "No One's Aware" was also featured in the film ''[[The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2]]'', which was released in August in the US and was released in the UK in January 2009. His song "Chemical Courage" was featured on the A&E television series ''[[The Cleaner (American TV series)|The Cleaner]]''. The track "Soldier's Eyes" from ''Between the Minds'' played over the closing credits of the second episode of the fifth series of ''[[Sons of Anarchy]].''

Savoretti toured Europe with [[Gavin DeGraw]] after he approached Savoretti asking him to be his support act. To coincide with Savoretti supporting DeGraw, Savoretti's debut album, ''[[Between the Minds]]'', was released on all European [[iTunes]] stores.

=== ''Harder Than Easy'' (2009–2011) ===
Savoretti's second album, ''[[Harder Than Easy]]'', was due for release on 6 July 2009. The album release was postponed and it was finally released in North America on 15 September 2009. On 14 April a new song called "Him & Her" was released through gigwise.com as a free download to launch the new album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Jack Savoretti video blog and download |work=Gigwise |url=http://www.gigwise.com/features/50431/Exclusive:%20Jack%20Savoretti%20Video%20Blog%20And%20Download |access-date=16 April 2009 }}</ref>

Savoretti wrote the track "One Day" specifically for the American film ''[[Post Grad]]'', and a version of "One Day" is performed in the film by Zach Gilford's character. A "One Day" music video featuring ''Post Grad'' footage was released.<ref>{{cite web |title=''Post Grad'' Sounds |work=Antimusic.com |url=http://www.antimusic.com/news/09/july/20Post_Grad_Sounds.shtml |access-date=21 July 2009 }}</ref> The film was released in the USA on 21 August 2009.<ref>{{IMDb title|1142433|Post Grad}}. Retrieved 21 July 2009.</ref>

On 2 November 2010, Savoretti announced via Facebook that he was in London working on his third album.<ref>{{Facebook|jacksavoretti}}. Retrieved 3 November 2010.</ref> He spent most of 2011 touring and working on his third album, debuting many new songs.

=== ''Before the Storm'' (2012) ===
[[File:Jack Savoretti, Shepherds Bush Empire (17091072748).jpg|thumb|right|Savoretti performing in 2014.]]
On 2 February 2012 Savoretti released the song "Hate & Love", featuring Sienna Miller, followed by the first single, "Knock Knock", on 12 February.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jack Savoretti announces new album ''Before the Storm'' |date=28 May 2012 |work=Contact Music |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/jack-savoretti-before-the-storm-may-2012 |access-date=6 June 2012}}</ref> On 3 May Savoretti released a third single called "Take Me Home" along with a music video. A competition was set for fans to cover this song and submit to the Facebook page in order to win the chance to tour with Savoretti. The third album, ''[[Before the Storm (Jack Savoretti album)|Before the Storm]]'', was released on 4 June. With his band, The Dirty Romantics, they recorded at Kensaltown Studios and mastered the LP at [[Abbey Road Studios]].<ref>{{cite web |title=From Sienna Miller to Bob Dylan: A conversation with Jack Savoretti |url=http://www.outofordermag.com/2012/03/jack-savoretti |work=Out of Order |access-date=6 June 2012 }}</ref> The album showed a new side to Savoretti, yet kept the same poetic charm seen in previous albums. Starting his UK leg of the tour at The Borderline, Savoretti showcased the new material whilst also appearing to have something else up his sleeve with a song called "Crazy Town". In the autumn of 2012, Jack co-wrote songs with [[Janet Devlin]] for her upcoming debut release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/press/former-x-factor-star-janet-devlin-launches-debut-album-campaign-with-pledgemusic |title=Former ''X Factor'' star Janet Devlin launches début album campaign with Pledgemusic |access-date=4 January 2015 }}</ref>

=== ''Written in Scars'' (2014–2015) ===
''Before the Storm'' re-ignited Savoretti's passion for songwriting, taught him how to put himself in his songs and, crucially, led him to the musicians who helped him helm ''[[Written in Scars]]'' – his fourth album and his first to be released by a major label, [[BMG Chrysalis UK|BMG Chrysalis]], with whom he signed in 2014. Many of the songs on the album were co-written with [[Samuel Dixon]] and Matt Benbrook.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/jack-savoretti-interview-the-former-new-paolo-nutini-on-finding-success-the-hard-way-9982632.html |title=Jack Savoretti interview: The former 'new Paolo Nutini' on finding success the hard way |last=Alexander |first=Ella <!--|date=16 January 2016--> |work=[[The Independent]] |date=16 January 2015 }}</ref> The track "Wasted" featured [[Lissie]] and a deluxe version contained three acoustic tracks.<ref>{{Discogs release |id=6686834 |name=Written in Scars |type=album }}.
