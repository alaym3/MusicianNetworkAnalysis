'''Yasemin Aygün Savgı''' (born 4 March 1982), better known as '''Yasemin Mori''', is a Turkish [[alternative rock]] singer.

==Biography==
As daughter of military architect father and [[Edirne]]-born mother worked as a sales chief on [[Turkish Airlines]], her original last name was ''Savgı''. She chooses to go by the scene alias ''[[wikt:mori|mori]]'', which means ''girl'' in various ethnic [[Balkan Turkic]] dialects, and which was a name she was called by many of her friends as a young girl.

She composed her first song when she was a teenager with contributions of her elder sister's music record share. At a [[Kings of Convenience]] concert on Istanbul on July 6, 2005, she invaded the stage by dancing on her own. Her first album ''Hayvanlar'' was released on 10 July 2008 by Irmak Plak. Mori released her second studio album ''Deli Bando'' in October 2012 after three years of development, working with members of [[Korhan Futacı ve Kara Orkestra]] and [[Boğaziçi Jazz Choir]].

Mori released her 3rd album ''Finnari Kakaraska'' in March 2015, featuring two covers ''Gel'' by [[Ajda Pekkan]] and ''Kanatları Gümüş Yavru Bir Kuş'' by [[Nazım Hikmet]].

She occasionally shares her works and announcements via her own [[Tumblr]] page since August 2009, as 2004 graduate of the Department of [[Graphic Design]] at [[Bilkent University]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://bilnews.bilkent.edu.tr/archive/issue_17_20/forum.html|title=Bilkent News}}</ref>
