==History==

===Early years and ''Pikul'' EP (2000–2005)===
[[File:Silversun pickups.png|thumb|300px|The band in 2005]]
The members of Silversun Pickups are friends who had played together previously. They began their career in Los Angeles clubs, most often at [[Silverlake Lounge]] or nearby [[Spaceland]], and began to draw a strong following upon the release of the ''[[Pikul (EP)|Pikul]]'' EP. The band originated in L.A.'s [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]] music scene, home of [[Rilo Kiley]] and others.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/6223/ |title=The Watson Twins display their Southern Manners |publisher=Fasterlouder.com.au |date=2006-09-28 |access-date=2015-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026195915/http://www.fasterlouder.com.au/features/6223/ |archive-date=2014-10-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

They have been repeatedly rumored to have been originally named A Couple of Couples, as the original lineup was supposedly composed of a pair of romantically involved couples — lead guitarist and vocalist Brian Aubert was dating drummer Elvira Gonzales, while bassist Nikki Monninger was dating rhythm guitarist/record producer Jack Kennedy. However, the band has stated that this is untrue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buzzbands.la/2015/09/25/silversun-pickups-riffing-on-band-drama-better-nature-and-being-old-school/| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20210929/http://buzzbands.la/2015/09/25/silversun-pickups-riffing-on-band-drama-better-nature-and-being-old-school/| archive-date=2021-09-29|title=Silversun Pickups: Riffing on band drama, ‘Better Nature’ and being old-school}}{{cbignore}}</ref> The name Silversun Pickups was derived from a [[liquor store]] located across from Silverlake Lounge. One of the friends would often arrive at the store late at night to buy liquor, making a "Silversun Pickup". In interviews, the band has said its name is more of "a state of mind".<ref>{{youtube|Z2BZlp47mRI}}</ref>

Brian Aubert met Nikki Monninger in 1994 on a flight from [[Los Angeles]] to [[London]]. Both of them were headed to [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] for a school exchange program. Aubert noticed Monninger sitting across the aisle from him stealing alcohol from the drink cart by distracting the flight attendant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/a-pickup-to-swoon-over/2009/04/23/1240079776664.html| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20210929/http://www.theage.com.au/news/entertainment/music/a-pickup-to-swoon-over/2009/04/23/1240079776664.html| archive-date=2021-09-29|title=A Pickup to swoon over|publisher=Theage.com.au|access-date=2015-09-06}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

For the ''[[Pikul (EP)|Pikul]]'' EP, fellow Silverlaker [[Tanya Haden]] was enlisted to play cello on the track "Kissing Families".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009WFEF0| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20210929/https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009WFEF0| archive-date=2021-09-29|title=Pikul [EP]|publisher=Amazon.com|access-date=2015-09-06}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===''Swoon'' (2008–2010)===
Silversun Pickups' second album, ''[[Swoon (Silversun Pickups album)|Swoon]]'',<ref>''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' Issue No.&nbsp;243</ref> includes 10 tracks, and instead of having a straightforward mid-tempo sound, Aubert said: "Some songs are very quiet and delicate, [while] others are just [freaking] loud."<ref>{{cite web|last=Garland |first=Max |url=http://www.elon.edu/pendulum/Story.aspx?id=2089 |title=Silversun Pickups make the crowd 'swoon' |publisher=The Pendulum - Elon University's News Organization |date=2010-04-21 |access-date=2015-09-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229133615/http://www.elon.edu/pendulum/Story.aspx?id=2089 |archive-date=2012-02-29}}</ref> The album was released on April 14, 2009, to positive reviews.

The first single released was "[[Panic Switch]]", which aired on VH1 and MTV music video shows and radio stations worldwide. "Panic Switch" is also featured in the video games ''[[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]'' and ''[[Rocksmith]]''.

Silversun Pickups played the 2009 Voodoo Music Experience Festival over the Halloween weekend.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268278/eminem-kiss-flaming-lips-to-headline-voodoo-experience| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20210929/https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268278/eminem-kiss-flaming-lips-to-headline-voodoo-experience| archive-date=2021-09-29 |title=Eminem, Kiss, Flaming Lips To Headline Voodoo Experience |publisher=Billboard |access-date=2015-09-06}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In 2009, the band performed "Catch and Release", "Panic Switch", "Lazy Eye", "Well Thought Out Twinkles", "Growing Old is Getting Old", and "Kissing Families" for ''[[MTV Unplugged]]''.

In early December 2009, the band was nominated in the [[Grammy Award for Best New Artist|Best New Artist]] category for the [[52nd Grammy Awards]]. Their nomination drew some controversy, because the band was already moderately successful before the 2008-2009 nominating year, although this was mainly due to misunderstandings involving the selections of Best New Artist nominees.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/a-brief-primer-on-how-to-become-a-best-new-artist-at-the-grammys.html| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20210929/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/12/a-brief-primer-on-how-to-become-a-best-new-artist-at-the-grammys.html| archive-date=2021-09-29 | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Pop & Hiss | date=December 4, 2009}}{{cbignore}}</ref>
