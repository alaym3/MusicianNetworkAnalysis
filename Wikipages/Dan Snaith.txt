Currently, the live band consists of Snaith, Ryan Smith, Brad Weber, and [[John Schmersal]]. Live shows also often include complex video projections on a large screen, as captured in a DVD released in November 2005.  "In music I will have an idea to put some different sounds together or a melody that meshes with a chord sequence or a sonic mood," said Snaith in an interview.  "I'm not the type of person who takes physical things apart and plays around with them, but I like taking mental ideas apart and playing around with them. That's what appeals to me about what I've spent my life doing."<ref>[[n:Caribou plays the Bowery Ballroom|Interview with Caribou]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', 6 November 2007</ref>
