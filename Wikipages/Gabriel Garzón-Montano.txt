==Career==
===2014–2016: ''Bishouné: Alma del Huila''===
On February 4, 2014, Garzon-Montano's ''Bishouné: Alma del Huila'' was released in conjunction with Styles Upon Styles, a Brooklyn based recording label. The extended play's title derives from his family heritage as Bishouné is a phonetic spelling of a childhood nickname his French mother called him, and Alma del Huila is a name for the Colombian municipality of Garzón, his father's last name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theransomnote.com/music/interviews/gabriel-garzon-montano-talks/|title=Gabriel Garzón-Montano Talks|website=Theransomnote.com|accessdate=October 3, 2020}}</ref> The 6-track extended play was Garzón-Montano's first release, and contained songs including "6 8" which had been written several years earlier. Garzón-Montano created tracks in [[GarageBand]] and would later record with Henry Hirsch at Waterfront Studios in Hudson, New York, where he played all the instruments to be tracked directly to 2-inch tape. After the project was completed, he pressed 500 vinyl copies of ''Bishouné'' with the indie label, which distributed it door-to-door to record stores in New York City. Singer [[Mayer Hawthorne]] heard the EP in a local record store and sent the album to [[Stones Throw Records]] which created the connection with the label for Garzon-Montano's next album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/gabriel-garz-n-montano-shares-the-true-meaning-behind-his-debut-album-jard-n-7865119|title=Gabriel Garzón-Montano Shares the True Meaning Behind His Debut Album Jardín|website=Ocweekly.com|first=Denise De La|last=Cruz|date=February 1, 2017}}</ref> [[Lenny Kravitz]] invited Garzón-Montano to open his Strut 2014 European stadium tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/world-cafe/2017/04/18/524526981/gabriel-garz-n-montano-on-world-cafe|title=Gabriel Garzón-Montano: On Heckling Philip Glass|website=Npr.org|accessdate=October 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.onestowatch.com/blog/gabriel-garz%C3%B3n-montano|title=How France, Colombia, & Brooklyn Created A Funk Visionary: A Q&A With Gabriel Garzón-Montano / Ones To Watch|website=Onestowatch.com|accessdate=October 3, 2020}}</ref> While Garzón-Montano was on tour in Europe, he received a message from long time friend [[Zoë Kravitz]] about [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] using his track "6 8" which ultimately resulted in "Jungle" from album ''[[If You're Reading This It's Too Late]]''<ref name="spin.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.spin.com/articles/level-up-gabriel-garzon-montano-interview/|title=Level Up: Gabriel Garzón-Montano|website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |type=Sponsored Story}}</ref> Later collaborations resulted in the singer working with British pop singer [[Eliza Doolittle (singer)|Eliza Doolittle]].<ref name="spin.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://remezcla.com/features/music/gabriel-garzon-montano-tells-us-how-6-8-got-sampled-by-drake/|title=Gabriel Garzón-Montano On How "6 8" Got Sampled By Drake|website=Remezcla.com|date=February 18, 2015|accessdate=October 3, 2020}}</ref> Garzón-Montano performed at Central Park's Summerstage<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/05/arts/music/pop-rock-cabaret-for-june-5-12.html|title=Pop, Rock & Cabaret for June 5–11|date=June 4, 2015|work=The New York Times}}</ref> as well as [[Lollapalooza]] in 2015, followed by another festival appearance at [[Estéreo Picnic Festival]] in Bogota, Colombia in 2016.<ref name="remezcla.com"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeout.com/chicago/music/lollapalooza-2015-sza-gabriel-garzon-montano|title=Lollapalooza 2015: SZA + Gabriel Garzon-Montano &#124; Music in Chicago|website=Timeout.com|accessdate=October 3, 2020}}</ref>
