'''Camp Lo''' is an [[United States|American]] [[hip hop]] duo, formed in 1995, which hails from [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]].<ref name="LarkinDM">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Dance Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1998|edition=First|isbn=0-7535-0252-6|page=51}}</ref> The duo consists of [[Rapping|rappers]] Sonny Cheeba (Salahadeen Wilds) and Geechi Suede (Saladine Wallace).<ref>[http://camplo.net/ Camplo.net] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106175015/http://www.camplo.net/ |date=2010-01-06 }}</ref> The duo is perhaps best known for their 1997 hit "[[Luchini AKA This Is It]]".

==Career==
Initially signed with [[Profile Records]], Camp Lo made their first appearance in 1996 on ''[[The Great White Hype]]'' soundtrack, with their [[Single (music)|single]], "Coolie High". The smooth party song was a minor hit, peaking at #25 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Hot Rap Tracks|Hot Rap Singles]] chart. Their first major exposure came with the release of their second single, the upbeat, horn-driven "Luchini", otherwise known as "This Is It". The song became a crossover hit in 1997, breaking into the Top 50 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and reaching the top 5 on the Hot Rap Singles chart. The track peaked at #74 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] in August 1997.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

The majority of the album was produced by [[Ski (producer)|Ski]], famous for his work with [[Jay-Z]].<ref name="LarkinDM"/> Guest appearances were provided by [[De La Soul]]'s Trugoy and [[Digable Planets]]' Butterfly.<ref name="LarkinDM"/> The album's 1970s styled content was influential on a number of artists within the next few years after its release, like [[Will Smith]], who enlisted Camp Lo for an appearance on his top-selling ''[[Big Willie Style]]'' album. Also in 1997, they appeared on [[Oran "Juice" Jones]]' single "Poppin' That Fly". They collaborated with [[De La Soul]] in 2000, on the song "So Good" from the ''Hip Hop 101 Compilation''. They finally returned with another album in 2002, titled ''[[Let's Do It Again (Camp Lo album)|Let's Do It Again]]''. This effort was not nearly as well-received as their debut, and was met with mediocre reviews and sales. Shortly after the album's release, [[Aesop Rock]] enlisted the duo to appear on his album ''[[Bazooka Tooth]]'', exposing them to fans of the underground [[Definitive Jux]] label. In 2007, the duo returned with ''[[Black Hollywood]]'' after a five-year hiatus from their previous release.

In April 2008, Camp Lo signed with SRC/Universal Records and changed its name to the Lo, on the recommendation from DJ Mr. Cee. The duo released a new single titled "Lumdi",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.loud.com/feature/feature_the-lo-lumdi|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921055507/http://www.loud.com/feature/feature_the-lo-lumdi|url-status=dead|title=Loud.com|archive-date=September 21, 2008}}</ref> [[record producer|produced]] by Korleon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/korleon180|title=Korleon &#124; Listen and Stream Free Music, Albums, New Releases, Photos, Videos|website=Myspace.com|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wrightwayentertainment.com/|title=Home|website=Wrightwayentertainment.com|access-date=January 2, 2020}}</ref> They also confirmed a 2011 release for a new collaboration album with [[Pete Rock]], as they form their new group '80 Blocks From Tiffanys'.
