'''Vreid''' is a Norwegian [[black metal]] band formed in 2004 after the breakup of [[Windir]] following the death of lead singer and founder [[Valfar]]. The remaining members along with new guitarist Ese formed Vreid. The band's name is an archaic Norwegian word meaning "Wrath".<ref name="Rockdetector">{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/norway/sogndal/vreid |title=Vreid entry @ Rockdetector |access-date=2016-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052132/http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/norway/sogndal/vreid |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Lee|first=Cosmo|date=November 24, 2009|title=Live review: Belphegor, Vreid|url=https://www.invisibleoranges.com/live-review-belphegor-vreid/|access-date=2020-08-23|website=[[Invisible Oranges]] - The Metal Blog}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Hváll formed a new band consisting of the three Windir members Hváll (bass), Steingrim (drums), Sture (vocals/guitar) and a new guitarist named Ese. Ese has been a close friend of the Vreid members for years, and he was co-engineer on [[Windir]]’s ''Likferd'' album.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/vreidikrig.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160817194521/http://heavymetal.about.com/od/cdreviews/fr/vreidikrig.htm |archive-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Hváll wrote most of the material for the debut album entitled ''[[Kraft (album)|Kraft]]''. The lyrics are in both Norwegian and English. ''Kraft'' was released by [[Tabu Records]] in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.metalreview.com/reviews/2693/vreid-pitch-black-brigade |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120729073932/http://metalreview.com/reviews/2693/vreid-pitch-black-brigade |archive-date=2012-07-29 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Vreid’s second album, ''[[Pitch Black Brigade]]'', was also released by [[Tabu Records]], on 27 March 2006.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/30431/Vreid-Milorg/|title=Vreid - Milorg (album review ) &#124; Sputnikmusic|website=Sputnikmusic.com|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rocknworld.com/thrashpit/reviews/07/10Vreid.shtml|title=Vreid - I Krig Review - Thrashpit.com|website=Rocknworld.com|access-date=8 October 2020}}</ref>

The band released their third album, ''[[I Krig]]'' (At War), through Indie Records in May / June 2007. All the lyrics on this record are based on poems from 1946 by [[Gunnar Reiss-Andersen]], a member of the Norwegian resistance fighters during World War II. This makes the album almost a concept album about war.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaldomination.se/reviews/vreid-milorg |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-02-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228035529/http://www.globaldomination.se/reviews/vreid-milorg |archive-date=2011-02-28 }}</ref>

In 2009, after releasing their fourth full-length album ''[[Milorg (album)|Milorg]]'', Ese left the band and was replaced by Stian "Strom" Bakketeig, the former [[Windir]] and Ulcus guitarist. Bakketeig plays guitar in [[Cor Scorpii]] and Mistur as well. Much like ''I Krig'', ''Milorg'' contains songs about the Norwegian resistance.{{cn|date=May 2021}}

In 2010, they released their first DVD called ''Vreid Goddamnit'' which contains live recordings filmed at [[Inferno Festival]]. On the same year, they released their first single entitled "Noen Å Hate", a cover of a [[Raga Rockers]] song.{{cn|date=May 2021}}
