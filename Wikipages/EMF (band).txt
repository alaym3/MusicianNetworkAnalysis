'''EMF''' are a British [[alternative rock]] band from [[Cinderford]], [[Gloucestershire]], who came to prominence at the beginning of the 1990s. During their initial eight-year run, from 1989 to 1997, the band released three studio albums before a hiatus. Their first single, "[[Unbelievable (EMF song)|Unbelievable]]", reached number 3 on the [[UK Singles Chart]],<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Band name==
The name EMF is an initialism of Epsom Mad Funkers, a name taken from a fan club of the band [[New Order (band)|New Order]] in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Unbelievable!: 24 years after their hit song, EMF get their social media verified|url = http://www.vanyaland.com/2014/06/19/unbelievable-24-years-hit-song-emf-get-twitter-account-verified/|website = Vanyaland|access-date = 2016-02-01}}</ref> 

The song "Head the Ball", which featured on the [[remix]] single release of "Lies", featured the repeating lines "[[electromotive force]]" and "ecstasy mother fucker". On the reissue of the band's 1991 album ''[[Schubert Dip]]'', after the song "Longtime", there is a [[hidden track]] titled "EMF". In this, the chorus lyrics start off with "E for Ecstasy, M for my mind's in my feet, F from us to you" and then move on to "E for Ecstasy, M for mother fucker mother fucker, F from us to you".

== Biography ==

===Formation (1989)===
The band originally formed with the [[Disc jockey|DJ]] Milf EMF. All the members were relatively well known in the local music scene before forming EMF in [[Cinderford]] in October 1989. Brownson had formed a band called Flowerdrum but left to join Foley, Decloedt and Atkin as EMF. Dench was last to join, having already tasted moderate success as a member of [[Apple Mosaic]].

The band's music also has been counted as part of [[Madchester]] and [[alternative dance]]. They toured the UK in 1990 with [[Stereo MCs]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/stereo-mcs-mn0000023202/biography|title=Stereo MC's &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=12 October 2019}}</ref> a band that was relatively unknown at that point.

===''Schubert Dip'' and ''Stigma'' (1990–1992)===
In 1990, their debut single "[[Unbelievable (EMF song)|Unbelievable]]" topped the charts in many countries around the world, reaching number 1 in the U.S. in July 1991. The single featured sampled utterances from comedian [[Andrew Dice Clay]]. In 1991, EMF released their debut album ''[[Schubert Dip]]'' which went to number 3 in the UK.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The name was explained by songwriter Ian Dench, as "If ever I'm short of a chord sequence, I nick one from Schubert."<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&pg=PA1892|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|page=1892}}</ref> Successful singles from the album included "[[I Believe (EMF song)|I Believe]]", "Children", and "Lies". The last was controversial as it included a voice sample of [[Mark David Chapman|Mark Chapman]], [[John Lennon]]'s murderer. [[Yoko Ono]], Lennon's wife, achieved an injunction, and a modified version was included in future pressings.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia">{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=David|url=https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/140|title=Guinness Rockopedia|publisher=Guinness Publishing Ltd.|year=1998|isbn=0-85112-072-5|edition=1st|location=London|page=[https://archive.org/details/guinnessrockoped0000unse/page/140 140]|url-access=registration}}</ref>

In 1992, EMF returned with the ''[[Unexplained EP]]'' (including a cover version of "[[Search and Destroy (The Stooges song)|Search and Destroy]]") and later ''[[Stigma (EMF album)|Stigma]]'', their second album. Both of these releases did poorly in the charts. The singles released were "Getting Through", "[[They're Here]]", and "[[It's You (EMF song)|It's You]]".

Also in 1992, EMF appeared on the [[Red Hot Organization]]'s dance compilation album ''[[Red Hot + Dance]]'', contributing "Unbelievable (The Hovering Feet Mix)". The album attempted to raise awareness and money in support of the AIDS epidemic, and all proceeds were donated to AIDS charities.

===''Cha Cha Cha'' and first hiatus (1995–2000)===
Until their 1995 album, ''[[Cha Cha Cha (album)|Cha Cha Cha]]'', EMF effectively had dissolved. This album featured the singles "[[Perfect Day (EMF song)|Perfect Day]]" and "[[Bleeding You Dry]]".

In 1995, EMF teamed with comedians [[Vic Reeves]] and [[Bob Mortimer]] and recorded "[[I'm a Believer]]", a cover of [[The Monkees]] song.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> This single reached #3 in the UK singles chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> The band then released ''[[Afro King]]'' which failed to do well. After this, the band split for the first time. However, all members of the band continued to play music. Ian Dench formed the indie rock band [[Whistler (band)|Whistler]], which was active from 1998 to 2000.

===Reunion and second hiatus (2001–2006)===
In 2001, EMF gave a reunion gig in London. They also released a greatest hits album: ''[[Epsom Mad Funkers: The Best of EMF]]''.

Zac Foley, the band's [[bass guitarist]], died on 3 January 2002<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1380899/Zac-Foley.html|title=Zac Foley|date=11 March 2018|website=Telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> at the age of 31, due to an overdose of non-prescribed drugs. EMF played just four more gigs in late 2002, before splitting again.

In 2005, [[Kraft Foods]] used EMF's "Unbelievable" in an advertisement for its Kraft Crumbles. The original song's chorus "You're unbelievable" was replaced with "They're crumbelievable".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adweek.com/creativity/kraft-uses-unbelievable-unbelievably-19852/|title=Kraft uses 'Unbelievable' unbelievably|website=www.adweek.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> The advertisement later was parodied by [[Stephen Colbert]] on his show ''[[The Colbert Report]]''.

===Second reunion (2007–2009)===
In 2007, the band announced they would be reforming to play a one-off gig at [[Scala (club)|the Scala]] in [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]], London, on 18 December. The place of Foley was taken by Richard March, formerly of [[Pop Will Eat Itself]] and [[Bentley Rhythm Ace]].

In 2007, [[Hallmark Cards]] used EMF's "Unbelievable" in its advertising for Mother's Day cards. The mother was shown opening the card, heard the daughter say "Mom, you rock", followed by the music of EMF. In 2008, EMF played the Portsmouth Festival on 9 October, and supported [[Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine|Carter USM]] at [[Birmingham Academy]] and London's [[Brixton Academy]] in November that year. In May 2009, EMF announced that due to personal issues, the band would not be doing any more shows in the near future, thus ending their second reunion.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Third reunion (2012)===
In 2012, they reformed to play at the inaugural festival [[Lakefest]] in [[Tewkesbury]], alongside [[Levellers (band)|Levellers]] and [[Dodgy]], on 18 and 19 May. For the first time they performed every track from the album ''[[Schubert Dip]]'' in order to coincide with the 21st anniversary re-release.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lakefest.co.uk/line-up-2012 |title=Lakefest 2012: Line-up 2012 |publisher=Lakefest.co.uk |date=2012-01-20 |access-date=2012-05-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419221052/http://lakefest.co.uk/line-up-2012 |archive-date=19 April 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.soglos.com/music/31938/EMF-join-Lakefest-2012-line-up|title=EMF join Lakefest 2012 line-up|website=SoGlos.com}}</ref> The band headlined at the Westbury Festival on 25 August 2012.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.efestivals.co.uk/festivals/others2012/westbury/|title=Westbury Festival 2012 - eFestivals.co.uk|website=Efestivals.co.uk}}</ref>
