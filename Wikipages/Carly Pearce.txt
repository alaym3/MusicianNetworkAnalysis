'''Carly Pearce''' (born '''Carly Cristyne Slusser'''; April 24, 1990) is an American [[country music]] singer and songwriter. Her material contains elements of both traditional and contemporary country-pop music. Pearce began performing professionally in her teens, appearing on several albums of [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]] material in the 2000s. After moving to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], she began gaining more widespread notice.

Pearce first gained major recognition in 2017 when her self-penned "[[Every Little Thing (Carly Pearce song)|Every Little Thing]]" found acclaim on [[satellite radio]]. The song helped Pearce secure a major label recording contract and became a major hit, reaching number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Country Airplay]] chart. Her debut album of the [[Every Little Thing (album)|same name]] debuted in the top five of the ''Billboard'' [[Top Country Albums]] chart. Pearce has since released new material, including the 2020 single "[[Next Girl]]" from ''[[29 (Carly Pearce EP)|29]]'', an EP released in February 2021.

==Career==

With the producer's termination, Pearce lost her deal with Sony. She later said that experience of having an opportunity and then losing it was difficult. In a 2017 interview with ''Nash Country Daily'', Pearce commented, "Of course there were moments that I wanted to quit music. My condo has seen many tears and heard many prayers at night. I’ve always known I wanted to do this, and like I said a little earlier, when you open your brain to still staying in the game and waiting it out and fighting and really understanding that this is a business."<ref name="nash">{{cite web |last1=Casey |first1=Jim |title="Every Little Thing" Singer Carly Pearce Shares 10 Little Things That Shaped Her Into Who She Is Today |url=https://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/02/17/every-little-thing-singer-carly-pearce-shares-10-little-things-that-shaped-her-into-who-she-is-today/ |website=Nash Country Daily |date=February 17, 2017 |access-date=25 February 2020 |archive-date=February 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225025406/https://www.nashcountrydaily.com/2017/02/17/every-little-thing-singer-carly-pearce-shares-10-little-things-that-shaped-her-into-who-she-is-today/ |url-status=live }}</ref> After losing the opportunity, she took a series of part-time jobs to help make ends meet.

==Musical styles==
Pearce's musical style is rooted in the [[Contemporary Country|contemporary country]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] genres.<ref name="allmusic"/> Her musical experiences included performing as part of a bluegrass band. These early performances influenced the style she would later create. Pearce has also credited notable bluegrass artists for their influence on her. This includes [[Alison Krauss]], [[Ricky Skaggs]] and [[Rhonda Vincent]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ladd |first1=Olivia |title=Carly Pearce Builds Her Confidence with 'Closer to You' |url=https://theboot.com/carly-pearce-closer-to-you-interview/ |website=The Boot |access-date=8 March 2020 |archive-date=August 9, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200809001202/https://theboot.com/carly-pearce-closer-to-you-interview/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Pearce's music has also been described as having elements of contemporary country. When reviewing her 2017 studio album, Allmusic's [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that it "still bears all the hallmarks of contemporary country production. It's crisp and nimble, using electronic and R&B as flair that accentuates the songs."<ref name="Allmusic Review"/> In ''[[Taste of Country]]''{{'s}} review of Pearce's 2017 album, it was mentioned that several album tracks (such as "Catch Fire") were "pop-leaning" in their sound.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Houghton |first1=Cillea |title=Album Spotlight: Carly Pearce ''Every Little Thing'' |url=https://tasteofcountry.com/carly-pearce-every-little-thing-album-review/ |website=[[Taste of Country]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |archive-date=February 14, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214073330/http://tasteofcountry.com/carly-pearce-every-little-thing-album-review/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition to bluegrass performers, Pearce has also been inspired by contemporary country artists. She has credited "late 1990s" female artists as major influences, notably [[Shania Twain]] and [[Trisha Yearwood]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Rowe |first1=Olivia |title=Exclusive: Carly Pearce Shares the Journey Behind Her Music |url=https://popculture.com/country-music/2017/09/25/carly-pearce-every-little-thing-country-music/ |website=Pop Culture |access-date=8 March 2020 |archive-date=October 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002060945/http://popculture.com/country-music/2017/09/25/carly-pearce-every-little-thing-country-music/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Pearce was also inspired by the career decisions of female country artists, including [[Faith Hill]]. In an interview with [[Good Morning America]], Pearce commented that she wanted her career choices to resemble Hill's: "I really want to be like what Faith Hill was to our genre back then. I love country music so much, and I wanted to do a little bit of that retro, cowhide, kind of throwback to the '90s ... but, like, a new spin on it."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hubbard |first1=Stephen |title=Carly Pearce talks being inspired by Faith Hill and husband Michael Ray on second album |url=https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/carly-pearce-talks-inspired-faith-hill-husband-michael-68961937 |website=[[Good Morning America]] |access-date=8 March 2020 |archive-date=March 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312095225/https://www.goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/carly-pearce-talks-inspired-faith-hill-husband-michael-68961937 |url-status=live }}</ref>
