'''Nikki Flores''' (born '''Brandi Nichole Flores'''; October 17, 1988) is an American independent pop singer, musician, songwriter, and record producer.

==Career==
===Recording artist===
Nikki Flores began writing songs and performing at 8 years old. Her parents, who are both musicians, built a home studio allowing her to perform. Flores was signed to [[Epic Records]] in 2005, at age 16. She recorded two unreleased albums, including ''This Girl'', which featured "Strike", written and produced by [[Ryan Tedder]]; she was released from the label in 2009.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

At this time Flores collaborated with producer [[Brian Kennedy (producer)|Brian Kennedy]] for a song entitled "Let It Slide". She uploaded a demo version of "Let It Slide" to her [[Myspace]] page and it received over 19&nbsp;million views and reached {{abbr|No.|number}}&nbsp;1 on the Myspace Top 100 charts.{{Citation needed|reason=Need reference for views and chart position.|date=July 2018}} She is proud of this song because of how relatable it is to her audience. "I was only writing about something that was so true for me in my life at that time. I released it on a whim and the response I got was overwhelming," she said.{{Cite quote|reason=Need information as to where/when she said this and a reference. Essential for biography of living person.|date=July 2018}}

In 2010, Flores signed onto [[Ryan Tedder]]'s Patriot Records, administered by [[Universal Republic]]. Tedder and Flores parted ways when the label was dissolved in 2012, and she turned her attention to writing with and for other artists.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

===Songwriting career===
In 2012, Flores co-wrote and was featured on "Roses" by [[Nas]] which was a deluxe edition bonus track on [[Life Is Good (Nas album)|''Life is Good'']].

She contributed lyrics and melodies to "Coolin" on [[Mýa]]'s ''[[Smoove Jones]]''; "Empty Words" on [[Christina Aguilera]]'s ''[[Lotus (Christina Aguilera album)|Lotus]]''; and "One Bad Night", "Palace", and "Sleepover" for [[Hayley Kiyoko]]. She had multiple collaborations with [[JoJo (singer)|JoJo]], including "Mad Love" on ''[[Mad Love (JoJo album)|Mad Love]]'', 2017's "Wonder Woman" and "Save My Soul" from EP ''[[III (JoJo EP)|III]]'', which was praised by media outlets such as ''Billboard'', Rap Up and Idolator.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6671098/jojo-tringle-atlantic-records-musical-limbo-interview|title = JoJo Releases 'Tringle,' Reflects on Her Forced Musical Limbo: 'I Knew No One Was Going to Save Me'}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2015/08/20/jojo-three-new-singles-tringle/|title = JoJo is Back with a 'Tringle' of Singles}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.idolator.com/7604925/jojo-tringle-release-stream-all-three-songs|title=JoJo's Tringle Release is Now Here: Listen to "Say Love," "Save My Soul" & "When Love Hurts"|date=August 20, 2015}}</ref>

===''XII XV'' EP===
In 2015, Flores enlisted the help of producer/musician Blake Stranathan, long time collaborators The Family ([[Linnea Deb]], [[Joy Deb]], [[Anton Malmberg Hård af Segerstad]]), and producers Glashaus to build her first release. The project was emotionally centered around ending a six-year relationship and the phases of finding herself in the aftermath. Her website noted influences of [[Frank Ocean]], [[Mariah Carey]], [[Aaliyah]] and [[Kanye West]].<ref>http://www.nikkiflores.com</ref>{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}
