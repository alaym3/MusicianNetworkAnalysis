===Pre-debut: ''Produce X 101''===
X1 was formed through the survival competition series ''[[Produce X 101]]'', which aired on [[Mnet (TV channel)|Mnet]] from May 3, 2019, until July 19, 2019. Out of an initial 101 trainees participating, the final 10 were chosen out of the remaining 20 trainees in the final week of the show.

===2020: Disbandment===
On January 6, 2020, CJ ENM, Swing Entertainment, and the members' individual agencies held a meeting to determine the future of the group.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://n.news.naver.com/entertain/now/article/468/0000612146|script-title=ko:엑스원 해체 결정, 각 소속사 전원 합의 되지 않아[공식]|work=Sports Seoul|via=Naver|language=ko|date=2020-01-06|access-date=2020-01-06}}</ref> After deliberating for an hour about whether the group should continue promoting or disband, a secret ballot was held by the members' agencies. The agencies agreed prior to voting that the group could only continue if there was unanimous agreement or else the group would disband. Four agencies voted to continue, four agencies voted to disband, and one agency whose vote was unclear was ultimately discarded. Thus, it was determined that the group would disband. Although X1 members were not invited to the meeting, Swing CEO Cho Yoo-myung expressed their collective desire to have attended.<ref name="Dispatch">{{cite web| url=https://www.dispatch.co.kr/2059256 |script-title=ko:[D하인드] "계산기를 두드렸다"…'엑스원', 해체 타임라인 |language=ko |website=Dispatch |date=2020-01-09 |access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>

After the group's disbandment was decided, CJ ENM suggested that a previously recorded winter track be released as a goodbye song, but the idea was rejected by two or three of the members' agencies. Similarly, a suggestion from a member's agency to record a final video was rejected by another agency.<ref name="Dispatch"/>

The disbandment was controversial among the fanbase of the group, ''One It'', because they felt that the disbandment of the group was unfair. They staged protests on CJ ENM, demanding that CJ ENM relaunch the group. To make their demands clear, ''One Its'' sent trucks with LED screens to promote their movement. According to [[Soompi]], approximately 1,000 fans were involved in the three hour protest. <ref>{{Cite web|date=January 22, 2020|title=Fans Protest Against CJ ENM For Formation Of New Group With X1 Members|url=https://www.soompi.com/article/1378576wpp/fans-protest-against-cj-enm-for-formation-of-new-group-with-x1-members|access-date=2021-05-18|website=Soompi|language=en}}</ref>
