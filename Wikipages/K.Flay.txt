[[File:K Flay 2007.jpg|thumb|right|K.Flay rapping at [[Stanford University]] in April 2007]]
K.Flay began her music career in 2003, believing that most hip hop hits on the radio were "simplistic, misogynistic and formulaic".<ref name="Biography">{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/6143419/k-flay/biography|title=K.
