Posner's third mixtape ''One Foot Out the Door'' was released in October 2009. The mixtape was accompanied by a web series of the same name which aired bi-weekly from September to December. Posner's debut album, ''[[31 Minutes to Takeoff]]'' was released in August 2010. The first single, "[[Cooler Than Me]]" has reached at number 6 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. He performed at music festival [[Bonnaroo]] and on the 2010s [[Warped Tour]]. The second and third singles, "[[Please Don't Go (Mike Posner song)|Please Don't Go]]" and  "[[Bow Chicka Wow Wow]]" reached the top 20 and 30 on the Hot 100 respectively. The latter was released with an added verse by rapper [[Lil Wayne]]. Posner won a 2011's [[ASCAP Award]] from the publishing organization for "[[Cooler Than Me]]". On October 7, 2011, [[RCA Music Group]] announced it was disbanding [[J Records]] along with [[Arista Records]] and [[Jive Records]]. With the shutdown, Posner (and all other artists previously signed to these three labels) will release his future material on the [[RCA Records]] brand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Christman|first=Ed|title=RCA's New Executive Team Named Under CEO Peter Edge Amid Layoffs (Update)|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-new-executive-team-named-under-ceo-1005324782.story|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 16, 2012|date=August 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326023401/http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/industry/record-labels/rca-s-new-executive-team-named-under-ceo-1005324782.story|archive-date=March 26, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Unveiling The New Look RCA Records|url=http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707|work=FMQB|access-date=May 16, 2012|date=August 23, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111108044953/http://www.fmqb.com/article.asp?id=2268707|archive-date=November 8, 2011|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/12/mike-posner-interview-i-took-a-pill-in-ibiza-remix-seeb|title=Mike Posner: 'I've only had success when I'm not trying to'|last=LeDonne|first=Rob|date=April 12, 2016|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=September 12, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913040233/https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/12/mike-posner-interview-i-took-a-pill-in-ibiza-remix-seeb|archive-date=September 13, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

On March 4, 2014, Posner announced his ''Unplugged'' tour. Running seven dates in the major US markets, the tour highlighted music new and old from Posner's discography, including some new material from ''Pages'', while also giving fans a shot at learning new information from him through the  stories and Q&A sessions interspersed with the tunes. The unplugged sets featured little more than Posner on predominantly acoustic instruments, save for the potential live production on "a song or two"—much like, he says, how much of his music starts. Posner began the tour on March 31 at the World Cafe in Philadelphia, wrapping up on April 10 at Los Angeles' The Mint. The string of dates also included a hometown show in Posner's native Detroit, his first such show, he says, in around two years. In an interview with ''Billboard'', Mike revealed that he had signed with [[Island Records]] and that ''Pages'' would be replaced with another project. He also stated that he would like to let the world hear his recordings from ''Sky High'' and ''Pages''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6509677/mike-posner-new-album-writing-for-maroon-5|title=Mike Posner Talks Writing for Maroon 5, Recording Sophomore Album - Billboard|work=Billboard|access-date=March 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151025023936/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6509677/mike-posner-new-album-writing-for-maroon-5|archive-date=October 25, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
