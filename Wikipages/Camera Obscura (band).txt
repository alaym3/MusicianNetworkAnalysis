'''Camera Obscura''' is a Scottish [[indie pop]] band from [[Glasgow]]. The group formed in 1996, and have released five albums to date – the most recent of which, ''[[Desire Lines]]'', was released in 2013. The current members of the band are vocalist [[Tracyanne Campbell]], guitarist Kenny McKeeve, bassist Gavin Dunbar, and drummer Lee Thomson. The band undertook an extended hiatus in 2015, following the death of long-serving keyboardist Carey Lander. The surviving members later reconvened in 2018. 

The band's bright take on indie pop has been frequently described as "[[twee pop]]," and garnered comparisons to fellow Scottish band [[Belle & Sebastian]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yissin |first1=Jibril |title=The 10 Best Twee Pop Albums To Own On Vinyl |url=https://magazine.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/the-10-best-twee-pop-albums-to-own-on-vinyl/ |website=Vinyl Me Please |date=18 November 2016 |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Carew |first1=Anthony |title=Camera Obscura |url=https://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/music/camera-obscura-20070202-ge44jx.html |website=TheAge.com.au |date=February 2007 |publisher=The Age |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref> The band have also been praised for their "honest, wide, and adult approach to heartbreak, romantic liaisons, and escapism."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Plagenhoaf |first1=Scott |title=Camera Obscura: Underachievers Please Try Harder Album Review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/1748-underachievers-please-try-harder/ |website=Pitchfork |publisher=Pitchfork Media |access-date=1 June 2021}}</ref>

==History==
Camera Obscura were formed in 1996 by [[Tracyanne Campbell]], John Henderson and Gavin Dunbar. Several other members performed with the band before David Skirving joined as a permanent guitarist. Their first releases were the singles "Park and Ride" and "Your Sound" in 1998.<ref name="NME_bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/artists/camera-obscura|title=Camera Obscura Biography|work=NME Artists|publisher=NME|access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref> The band's line-up changed in 2000 and 2001 when Lee Thomson joined as its permanent drummer, Lindsay Boyd joined as a keyboard player, and Skirving left and was replaced by Kenny McKeeve.<ref name="NME_bio"/><ref name="Allmusic_bio">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p542162/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Camera Obscura|website=Allmusic|access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref>

Camera Obscura's first album, ''[[Biggest Bluest Hi Fi]]'', was released in 2001. The album was produced by [[Stuart Murdoch (musician)|Stuart Murdoch]] of [[Belle & Sebastian]] and was supported by [[John Peel]].<ref name="Allmusic_bio"/> The first single from the album, "Eighties Fan", came in at number eight in the [[Festive Fifty]] in 2001,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/festive50s/2000s/2001|title=Radio 1 – Keeping It Peel – Festive 50s – 2001|publisher=BBC|access-date=3 April 2012}}</ref> and charted in several independent music charts. Nigel Baillie joined the band as a trumpeter and percussionist in 2002<ref name="Allmusic_bio"/> and Carey Lander replaced Boyd. In the summer of 2002, Peel asked the band to do their first [[List of Peel sessions|Peel session]].<ref name="NME_bio"/>

The band's second album, ''[[Underachievers Please Try Harder]]'', was released in 2003 and was followed by Camera Obscura's first full tour of Great Britain and [[Ireland]] and the band's first tour of the [[United States]]. Founding member John Henderson left Camera Obscura following this tour.<ref name="Pitchfork_2006_interview">{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6441-camera-obscura|title=Camera Obscura|date=25 September 2006|work=Interviews|publisher=Pitchfork Media|access-date=16 June 2009}}</ref> In early 2004 the band recorded the songs "I Love My Jean" and "Red, Red Rose" following their third Peel session, in which Peel had asked them to put these poems by [[Robert Burns]] to music.<ref name="Allmusic_bio"/>

Camera Obscura recorded their third album, ''[[Let's Get Out of This Country]]'', in Sweden over the course of two weeks with producer [[Jari Haapalainen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfweekly.com/sanfrancisco/if-its-not-scottish-its-crap/Content?oid=2160397|title=If It's Not Scottish, It's Crap!|last=Keresman|first=Mark|date=19 July 2006|website=[[SF Weekly]]|access-date=19 October 2014}}</ref> The album was released on 6 June 2006.

In November 2008, the band announced that they had completed recording the follow-up to ''Let's Get Out of This Country'', and in February 2009, they announced they had signed with [[4AD]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Webb|first=Rob|url=http://drownedinsound.com/news/4136193|title=4AD announce trio of signings|publisher=Drownedinsound.com|date=4 February 2009|access-date=3 April 2012|archive-date=23 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323105917/http://drownedinsound.com/news/4136193|url-status=dead}}</ref> The new album, ''[[My Maudlin Career]]'', was released in April 2009, and preceded by the first single "French Navy". [[London]]-based jewellery brand Tatty Devine created brooches and necklaces to coincide with the launch. The album was the band's first UK Top 40 success, and it also reached the top 40 in Ireland and the US Billboard Top 100. Around this time, the band announced that "due to family commitments (including being a proud dad) Nigel will no longer be a full time member of Camera Obscura".<ref>{{cite web|title=Camera Obscura's New Album|url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=41515127&blogId=469613975|date=9 February 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324013053/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=41515127&blogID=469613975|archive-date=24 March 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

On 18 April 2009, Camera Obscura released a special edition [[Record Store Day]] 7" called "French Navy"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recordstoreday.com/CustomPage/642|title=Records Store Day Releases – 2009|publisher=Record Store Day|date=29 April 1992|access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> for independent record stores. "French Navy" was also used by Echo Falls, who are the sponsors of ''[[Come Dine With Me]]'', at the start of each episode and during commercial breaks. Their album ''[[Desire Lines]]'' was produced by [[Tucker Martine]] and released by 4AD on 3 June 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Thomas|first=Fred|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/desire-lines-mw0002542761|title=Desire Lines Awards|website=AllMusic|access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> The album was the band's second UK Top 40 entry and narrowly missed the US Top 100.

In 2015, the band announced the cancellation of planned gigs in North America due to the illness of Carey Lander.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/CameraObscuraMusic/posts/10154152399312782|title=Camera Obscura – It is with regret that Camera Obscura...|publisher=Facebook|access-date=11 October 2015}}</ref> She was first diagnosed with [[osteosarcoma]] in 2011.

In May 2018, while Campbell was promoting the self-titled debut album of Tracyanne & Danny, her new project with [[Danny Coughlan]], she noted that she still kept in touch with the other members of Camera Obscura in the wake of Lander's passing, but the future of the band remained undiscussed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts_ents/16225044.Tracyanne_Campbell_on_Camera_Obscura__the_loss_of_bandmate_Carey_Lander_and_her_new_album/|title= Tracyanne Campbell on Camera Obscura, the loss of bandmate Carey Lander and her new album|first=Teddy|last=Jamieson|publisher=The Herald|date=19 May 2018|access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref> The song "Alabama" from the ''Tracyanne & Danny'' album is Campbell's tribute to Lander.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/entertainment/music/music-news/losing-carey-massive-camera-obscura-12536846|title='Losing Carey was massive' Camera Obscura singer on returning to music after band mate's death|first=Annie|last=Brown|newspaper=Daily Record|date=15 May 2018|access-date=22 May 2018}}</ref>

On 5 September 2018, Camera Obscura announced their live return as part of the Boaty Weekender, a cruise festival curated by Belle & Sebastian sailing from Barcelona to Cagliari on 8–12 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/71425497781/posts/10157757855827782/|title=Hi folks|author=Camera Obscura|publisher=Facebook|date=5 September 2018|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

Prior to participating in the Boaty Weekender, the band announced a warm-up show at Saint Luke's & The Winged Ox in Glasgow on 5 August with proceeds donated to the Prince and Princess of Wales Hospice in memory of Carey Lander.<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Camera Obscura|user=camera_obscura_|number=1123181172861874181|date=30 April 2019|accessdate=6 August 2019|title=We’re warming up for our Boaty Weekender gigs by playing St Luke’s...}}</ref> After tickets for the show were sold out, the band added a second date with proceeds also being donated.<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Camera Obscura|user=camera_obscura_|number=1124235837074477056|date=3 May 2019|accessdate=6 August 2019|title=Thanks for the kind words and fast ticket purchases...}}</ref>

For these shows and the Boaty Weekender, the band brought in Donna Maciocia, formerly of [[Amplifico]], on keyboards and backing vocals.<ref name=Maciocia>{{cite tweet|last=Maciocia|first=Donna|user=DonnaMaciocia|number=1157746456553512966|date=4 August 2019|accessdate=6 August 2019|title=Super stoked to be playing these shows with @Camera_Obscura_...}}</ref><ref>{{cite tweet|author=Camera Obscura|user=camera_obscura_|number=1142842913656901634|date=24 June 2019|accessdate=6 August 2019|title=Great rehearsals this weekend in prep for our first gig in 42 days...}}</ref>

On 5 August 2019, Camera Obscura hinted at the possibility of releasing new music when responding to a tweet referring to ''Desire Lines'' as their "5th and final album," to which the band replied "It's definitely our fifth album.....".<ref>{{cite tweet|author=Camera Obscura|user=camera_obscura_|number=1158373577823019008|date=5 August 2019|accessdate=6 August 2019|title=It’s definitely our fifth album.....}}</ref> The band confirmed in May 2020 that they were preparing a new album, but had been forced to delay recording it due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Camera Obscura |title=Camera Obscura Faceboook |url=https://www.facebook.com/CameraObscuraMusic/photos/a.10151989061672782/10159865771797782/?type=3&theater |publisher=Facebook |access-date=25 August 2020 |date=2 May 2020}}</ref>
