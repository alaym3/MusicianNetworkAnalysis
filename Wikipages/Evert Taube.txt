'''Axel Evert Taube''' ({{IPA-sv|ˈěːvɛʈ ˈʈoːb|-|sv-Evert_Taube.ogg}};{{efn|In isolation, ''Taube'' is pronounced {{IPA-sv|ˈtoːb|}}.}} 12 March 1890 – 31 January 1976) was a Swedish author, artist, composer and singer. He is widely regarded as one of Sweden's most respected musicians and the foremost troubadour of the [[Swedish ballad tradition]] in the 20th century.<ref name="Taube">[[:sv:Evert Taube|Evert Taube.]] ''sv.wikipedia.org''. Retrieved: 27 June 2013.</ref>

==Early life==
Evert Taube was born in 1890 in [[Gothenburg]], and brought up on the island of [[Vinga (Sweden)|Vinga]], [[Västergötland]], where his father, Carl Gunnar Taube, a ship's captain, was the lighthouse keeper. His mother was Julia Sofia Jacobsdotter. Taube belongs to an untitled branch of the [[Baltic German]] noble [[Taube family]], introduced at the [[Swedish House of Nobility]] in 1668 as noble family No. 734.<ref name="Taube"/>

==Career==
[[File:Evert Taube Sandhamnsregattan 1942 001.jpg|thumb|200px|Taube at ''Sandhamnsregattan'' in 1942 on his [[Nordic Folkboat]] ''F-S74 Carmencita of Sjösala''.]]
Having spent two years (1907–1909) sailing around the [[Red Sea]], [[Ceylon]] and South Africa, Taube began his career as a singer-songwriter and collector of sailors' songs, and on Christmas Eve 1908, on board the Norwegian ship ''SS Bergen'' headed for Spain, he performed "Turalleri, piken fra Hamburg".

Following a five-year stay (1910–1915) in [[Argentina]], he developed an interest in [[Latin American music]] and introduced the Argentinian [[Tango (dance)|tango]] to Sweden in the twenties. Contrary to widespread perceptions, Taube did not work as a [[gaucho]] (cowboy) on the [[Pampa]]s but as a [[Construction foreman|foreman]] supervising workers who were digging canals designed to prevent flooding on the vast plains.

He is perhaps best known as a depictor of the idyllic, with motifs from the Swedish archipelagoes and from the [[Mediterranean]], from a perspective every Swedish four-week holiday tourist could recognize. But he also wrote the most hitting anti-fascist anti-war poem in the Swedish language, "Målaren och Maria Pia", about the Italian war in Abyssinia, from the late 30s, as well as the anthem of the budding environmental movement in the 70s, "[[Änglamark]]" (originally written for the successful 1971 [[Hasse & Tage]] film ''[[The Apple War]]'').

Taube´s literary secretary [[Inga-Britt Fredholm]] was from late 1950s working as a secretary at the Park Avenue Hotel in [[Göteborg|Gothenburg]]. There, in 1962, Evert Taube met her and this led to her becoming his literary secretary for more than ten years. During the 1964–1965 period she undertook travel for work, along with Taube, going to the [[Antibes]] in [[France]] and to the [[Pampas]] in [[Argentina]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Matz |first=Edvard |last2=Nilsson |first2=Gunnar |title=Äventyret Evert: en bok om färder med Evert Taube till hans diktnings landskap |year=1986 |publisher=Rabén & Sjögren |place=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=91-29-57840-X |id={{LIBRIS|7235962}} |page=20c, 25c, 28, 45 (photo), 47c, 61, 68c, 71 (photo), 77c, 82, 94c, 103c, 136, 138, 141, 144 }}</ref> She collaborated with [[Astri Taube]] on "Vid tiden för Astri och Apollon: okända dikter och berättelser", published in 1964.<ref>{{Citation |last=Taube |first=Evert |last2=Fredholm |first2=Inga-Britt |last3=Taube |first3=Astri |title=Vid tiden för Astri och Apollon: okända dikter och berättelser |year=1964 |publisher=Bonnier |place=Stockholm |language=sv|id={{LIBRIS|1246736}} }}</ref> 

During the 1960s Fredholm collected Evert Taube´s stories and published them in eight volumes at [[Albert Bonniers Förlag]] under the shared title of "Samlade berättelser med tillhörande visor och ballader", released 1966–1967. In the 1970s she produced two pictorial biographies of Taube: ”När jag var en ung caballero: en bildbiografi” (1970) and ”Kom i min famn: Evert Taube 1920-1971 : en bildbiografi” (1972).<ref>{{cite book |last=Taube |first=Evert |last2=Fredholm |first2=Inga-Britt |title=När jag var en ung caballero: en bildbiografi |year=1970 |publisher=Bonnier |place=Stockholm |language=sv |id={{LIBRIS|2818173}} }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Fredholm |first=Inga-Britt |title=Kom i min famn: Evert Taube 1920-1971 : en bildbiografi |year=1972 |publisher=Bonnier |place=Stockholm |language=sv |isbn=9100377015 |id={{LIBRIS|7143753}} }}</ref>  

Among Taube's most famous songs are "[[Calle Schewens vals]]", "[[A Red, Red Rose|Min älskling (du är som en ros)]]", "Dans på Sunnanö", "Brevet Från Lillan", "Flickan i Havanna", "[[Änglamark]]", "[[Sjösala vals]]", "[[Fritiof och Carmencita]]", "[[Så skimrande var aldrig havet]]" and "Så länge skutan kan gå".<ref name="Taube"/>

In 1976 he released an album of songs (on SR Records) about and by Sweden's 18th century bard, [[Carl Michael Bellman]], performing 9 of Bellman's ''[[Fredmans epistlar|Fredman's Epistles]]'' including the ever popular ''[[Vila vid denna källa]]'', ''[[Ulla! min Ulla! säj, får jag dig bjuda]]'', and ''[[Solen glimmar blank och trind]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Evert Taube Sjunger Och Berättar Om Carl Michael Bellman|url=https://www.discogs.com/Evert-Taube-Evert-Taube-Sjunger-Och-Ber%C3%A4ttar-Om-Carl-Michael-Bellman/release/1190133|publisher=Discogs|access-date=15 March 2016}}</ref>
