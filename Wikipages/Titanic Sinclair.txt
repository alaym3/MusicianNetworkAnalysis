Sinclair was commissioned to created an acoustic video series for singer/musician [[Børns]]. One video featured LA singer/songwriter [[Zella Day]]. The videos featured music from Børns' first EP titled ''Candy'' which Sinclair also provided the EP artwork for.

After moving to [[Los Angeles]] in 2013 to pursue a musical career, Poppy collaborated with Sinclair<ref>{{cite web|title=Corey Michael Mixter|url=https://genius.com/artists/Corey-michael-mixter|publisher=[[Genius (website)|Genius]]|accessdate=October 6, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171007021105/https://genius.com/artists/Corey-michael-mixter|archivedate=October 7, 2017}}</ref> on a long series of abstract performance art, music, and promotional videos on [[YouTube]] which presented Poppy as a mysterious, not-quite-human internet-created character.

In June 2019, Sinclair directed the music video for rapper [[Vic Mensa]]'s song "Camp America".

==Controversies==
===Mars Argo lawsuit===
On April 17, 2018, Sinclair's former collaborator and partner Mars Argo filed a lawsuit in [[United States District Court for the Central District of California|Central California court]] against Sinclair and Poppy alleging copyright infringement, stating that Sinclair based Poppy's online persona on hers, as well as emotional and physical abuse Sinclair had allegedly subjected her to in the period after their separation and the subsequent abandonment of the project.<ref>{{cite news|title=YouTube Feud: Mars Sues Titanic and ThatPoppy: You Jacked My Identity!!!|url=http://www.tmz.com/2018/04/17/youtube-legal-feud-titanic-sinclair-mars-argo-thatpoppy/|work=[[TMZ]]|accessdate=April 17, 2018}} {{verify source |date=September 2019 |reason=This ref was deleted Special:Diff/901658872 by a bug in VisualEditor and later restored by a bot from the original cite located at Special:Permalink/901650135 cite #29 - verify the cite is accurate and delete this template.

===Poppy===
On December 29, 2019, Poppy released a statement on Twitter announcing that she parted ways with Sinclair, claiming that he "glamorizes suicide" and used it as a way to manipulate her.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.papermag.com/poppy-titanic-sinclair-2642681887.html|title=Poppy Parts with Creative Partner Titanic Sinclair|date=December 29, 2019|website=PAPER}}</ref> An example of this behavior is an instance in which Poppy alleges Sinclair was going to hang himself with one of her personal belongings and had also messaged fans details about his suicidal attempts for attention. She said that Sinclair "lives an illusion that he is a gift to this Earth" and that she was "trapped in a mess that [she] needed to dig [her]self out of."<ref>{{cite tweet |user=poppy |number=1211006950160269313 |date=2019-12-28 |title=To whom it may concern, ... |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231173959/https://twitter.com/poppy/status/1211006950160269313 |archive-date=2019-12-31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/poppy-splits-creative-partner-titanic-sinclair/|title=Poppy Splits With Creative Partner Titanic Sinclair|first=Chad|last=Childers|website=Loudwire}}</ref> Prior to the statement, Sinclair's directorial credits were removed from recent videos on Poppy's YouTube channel, with his songwriting credits later being removed from several songs on streaming platforms.
