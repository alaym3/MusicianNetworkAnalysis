'''James Ambrose Johnson Jr.''' (February 1, 1948 – August 6, 2004), better known by his stage name '''Rick James''', was an American singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and record producer. Born and raised in [[Buffalo, New York]], James began his musical career in his teen years. He was in various bands before entering the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Navy Reserve]] to avoid [[conscription|being drafted]] into the army. In 1964, James [[desertion|deserted]] to [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], where he formed the rock band [[the Mynah Birds]], who eventually signed a recording deal with [[Motown|Motown Records]] in 1966. James' career with the group halted after military authorities discovered his whereabouts and eventually convicted and sentenced James to a one-year prison term related to the desertion charges. After being released, James moved to [[California]], where he started a variety of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[funk]] groups in the late 1960s and early 1970s.

After forming the locally popular Stone City Band in his hometown of Buffalo in 1977, James finally found success as a recording artist after signing with Motown's [[Gordy Records]], releasing the album ''[[Come Get It!]]'' in 1978 which produced the hits "[[You and I (Rick James song)|You & I]]" and "[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]". In 1981, James released his most successful album, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which included career-defining hits such as "[[Give It to Me Baby]]" and "[[Super Freak]]", the latter song becoming his biggest [[Crossover music|crossover single]], mixing elements of funk, disco, rock and [[new wave music|new wave]]. James was also known for his [[soul music|soulful]] ballads such as "Fire & Desire" and "[[Ebony Eyes (Rick James song)|Ebony Eyes]]". In addition, James also had a successful career as a songwriter and producer for other artists including [[Teena Marie]], the [[Mary Jane Girls]], [[the Temptations]], [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Smokey Robinson]].

James' mainstream success had peaked by the release of his album ''[[Glow (Rick James album)|Glow]]'' in 1985 and his appearance on the popular TV show, ''[[The A-Team]]''. His subsequent album releases failed to sell as well as their predecessors. Rapper [[MC Hammer]] sampled James' "Super Freak" for his 1990 hit, "[[U Can't Touch This]]" which won [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song|Best R&B Song]] at the [[33rd Annual Grammy Awards|1991 Grammy Awards]]. James received his only Grammy for composing the song.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/rick-james/13206 |title=Rick James |publisher=Recording Academy |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> By the early 1990s, James' career was hampered by his drug addiction and he was embroiled with legal issues. In 1993, James was convicted for two separate instances of kidnapping and assaulting two different women while under the influence of [[crack cocaine]], resulting in a three-year sentence at [[Folsom State Prison]]. James was released on parole in 1996 and released the album ''[[Urban Rapsody]]'' in 1997. James' health problems halted his career again after he had a mild stroke during a concert in 1998, and he announced a semi-retirement.

In 2004, James' career returned to mainstream [[Popular culture|pop culture]] after he appeared in an episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. The segment involved a [[Charlie Murphy]] ''[[E! True Hollywood Story|True Hollywood Stories]]''–style skit that satirized James' wild lifestyle in the 1980s. This resulted in renewed interest in his music and that year he returned to perform on the road. James died later that year from heart failure at age 56.

In November 2020, James' estate confirmed the sale of a 50% stake in his publishing and masters catalog to the [[Hipgnosis Songs Fund]],<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cirisano |first1=Tatiana |title=Hipgnosis Songs Acquires 50% Stake in Rick James Catalog, Including Masters|url= https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9483736/hipgnosis-songs-rick-james-catalog-masters-catalogue/ |website=Billboard.com

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Johnson was born on February 1, 1948, in [[Buffalo, New York]], to Mabel (née Sims) and James Ambrose Johnson Sr. He was one of eight children. James' father, an autoworker, left the family when James was 10. His mother was a dancer for [[Katherine Dunham]], and later worked as a [[Numbers game|numbers-runner]] to earn a living.<ref name="glowreview">{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2014/07/05/rick-james-reveled-in-super-freaky-autobiography-i-was-caligula/ |title=Rick James' insane life of sex, drugs and music |last=Getlen |first=Larry |date=July 5, 2014 |work=[[New York Post]] |access-date=November 17, 2014}}</ref> James' mother would take him on her collecting route, and it was in bars where she worked that James saw performers such as [[John Coltrane]], [[Miles Davis]], and [[Etta James]] perform.<ref name="glowreview" /> James claimed later, in the autobiography ''Glow'', that he lost his virginity at "age 9 or 10" to a 14-year-old local girl, claiming his "kinky nature came in early."<ref name="glowreview" /> James eventually attended [[Orchard Park High School]] and [[Bennett High School (Buffalo, New York)|Bennett High School]] prior to dropping out. James was introduced to drugs at an early age and was busted for burglary as a young teen.<ref name="glowreview" /> Due to his stints in jail for theft, James entered the [[United States Navy Reserve]] at 14 or 15, lying about his age, to avoid the [[Conscription in the United States#Vietnam|draft]]. During that time, he also became a drummer for local jazz groups in [[New York City]].<ref name="glowreview" /> Due to him missing his twice-monthly [[United States Navy Reserve|Reserve]] sessions aboard {{USS|Enterprise|CVN-65|6}}, he found himself ordered to [[Vietnam]].<ref name="glowreview" />

=== Early career ===
In 1964, James fled to [[Toronto]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James|last1=James|first1=Rick|publisher=Atria Books|last2=Ritz |first2=David|name-list-style=amp|year=2014|isbn=9781476764146|edition=First hardcover|location=New York|oclc=862348461}}</ref> Soon after his arrival three drunk men tried to attack him outside a club; a trio of other men came to his aid. One of them, [[Levon Helm]], was at the time was a member of [[Ronnie Hawkins]]' backing band.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2014/07/rick-james-memoir-moments-glow.html|title=The 12 Most Rick James–y Moments in Rick James's New Memoir, Glow|last=Carley|first=Brennan|date=July 11, 2014|website=Vulture|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Helm invited James to their show later that night and he ended up performing onstage with the band.<ref name=":0" /> In Toronto James made friends with local musicians [[Neil Young]] and [[Joni Mitchell]].<ref name="glowreview" /> To evade US military authorities, James went under the assumed name "Ricky James Matthews".<ref name="glowreview" /> That same year, James formed [[The Mynah Birds]], a band that produced a fusion of [[Soul music|soul]], [[Folk music|folk]] and rock music. In 1965, the band briefly recorded for the Canadian division of [[Columbia Records]], releasing a single, "Mynah Bird Hop"/"Mynah Bird Song". At one point, [[Nick St. Nicholas]], later of [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] fame, was a member; by the time "Mynah Bird Hop" was recorded bassist [[Bruce Palmer]] had replaced him. James and Palmer recruited guitarists Tom Morgan and Xavier Taylor and drummer Rick Mason to form a new Mynah Birds lineup, and soon traveled to Detroit to record with [[Motown]]. Before the group began recording their first songs for the label, Morgan left, unhappy about the label's attitude towards the musicians. Neil Young eventually took his place. It was while in Detroit that James met his musical heroes, [[Marvin Gaye]] and [[Stevie Wonder]]. After meeting Wonder and telling him his name, Wonder felt the name "Ricky James Matthews" was "too long", and told James to shorten it to "Ricky James".<ref name="glowreview" />

In 1966, a financial dispute in Toronto between James and the Mynah Birds' handler, Morley Shelman{{sfn|Benjaminson|2017|p=42}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://neilyoungnews.thrasherswheat.org/2012/04/mynah-birds-in-depth-exclusive.html|title=Neil Young News: The Mynah Birds: An In Depth Exclusive|date=April 20, 2012|website=Thrasher's Wheat}}</ref>{{sfn|Durchholz|2010|p=23}} led to Motown's learning of James's fugitive status with the Navy. Hoping to prevent any scrutiny, Motown execs told Rick they would not be releasing any more of his material and convinced him to come back and work with them after straightening out his legal issues.{{sfn|Benjaminson|2017|p=42}}{{sfn|Durchholz|2010|p=23}} James surrendered himself to the [[FBI]], and, in May 1966, was sentenced by the Navy to five months' hard labor for unauthorized absence. He was not yet 19 years old. James escaped from the Brooklyn Naval Brig after only six weeks' confinement, but following another six months as a fugitive, surrendered himself a second time. With help from his mother, James found legal assistance from his cousin, future Congressman [[Louis Stokes]], and another attorney, former Marine Captain John Bracken, who pled James' second [[court-martial]] down from a potential five years' hard labor to five months.<ref name="glowreview" />{{sfn|Benjaminson|2017|pp=43–47}} After his release from [[Portsmouth Naval Prison]] in August 1967, James returned to Toronto{{sfn|Benjaminson|2017|pp=47–48}} and endured another detention, initially derailing resumption of his career with Mynah Bird bandmate [[Neil Merryweather]], with whom he would later collaborate, first at Motown and then in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Durchholz|2010|p=23}}{{sfn|Benjaminson|2017|pp=50, 53}}

In 1968, again working under the pseudonym Ricky Matthews, James produced and wrote songs at Motown for acts such as [[The Miracles]], [[Bobby Taylor & the Vancouvers]], and [[The Spinners (American R&B group)|The Spinners]]. According to James, he briefly got involved in [[procuring (prostitution)|pimp activity]] during this time, but stopped because he felt he was not qualified for it due to the harsh activity and the abuse of women there.<ref name="glowreview" /> It was during this third stint at Motown that James met musician [[Greg Reeves]]. Reeves, hoping to find a better situation than the [[United States dollar|US$]]38 a week (US${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|85|1968}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) he was earning as a session bassist for [[Berry Gordy]], joined James, looking to "hitch a lift from Neil Young's rising star," and relocated to Los Angeles.{{sfn|Benjaminson|2017|p=56}}

On one of his first nights in Los Angeles, James was crashing on musician [[Stephen Stills]]' couch. When he awoke he saw a stoned young man sitting on the floor in the [[lotus position]]. The man's wrists were bleeding so a scared James sought help. James was later formally introduced to the man who was [[Jim Morrison]], lead singer of [[the Doors]]. After the Doors opened for [[Buffalo Springfield]] at the [[Whisky a Go Go]], Morrison tricked James into taking [[Acid (drug)|acid]].<ref name=":0" />

In California, James initially worked as a duo with Greg Reeves, but soon after James introduced Reeves to Neil Young, it was Reeves, not James, who was hired as bassist for the newly formed rock [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]].<ref name="glowreview" /><ref name="nickwarburton.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nickwarburton.com/wordpress/?cat=7|title=Rick James's Early Years|website=nickwarburton.com |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Around this time James formed several versions of the rock band Salt'N'Pepper<ref name="nickwarburton.com" /> and got involved with [[Hairdresser|hair stylist]] [[Jay Sebring]], who agreed to invest in his music.<ref name="glowreview" /> James claimed that in 1969 Sebring invited him to attend a party at actress [[Sharon Tate]]’s house, but he was too [[Hangover|hungover]] to get out of bed. The next morning he discovered that Sebring had been [[Tate murders|murdered]] when he saw the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' headline "Sharon Tate, Four Others Murdered."<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

In 1970, James and Salt'N'Pepper member Ed Roth participated in the recording of Bruce Palmer's solo album ''[[The Cycle Is Complete]]''. The duo also recorded as part of the group Heaven and Earth in Toronto. Heaven and Earth eventually changed their name to Great White Cane and recorded a self-titled album for the Los Angeles label Lion Records, released in 1972. James formed another band, Hot Lips, afterwards. He also briefly replaced [[Mendelson Joe]] in the Toronto blues band [[McKenna Mendelson Mainline]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joe |first1=Mendelson |last2=Halim |first2=Nadia Maria |title=Alien: The Strange Life and Times of Mendelson Joe |year=2000 |publisher=ECW Press |page=50 |isbn=978-1-550-22426-9}}</ref> During this period, James and Mainline guitarist [[Mike McKenna (musician)|Mike McKenna]] co-wrote the song "You Make the Magic", which would later be released by [[The Chambers Brothers]] as a B-side to their single "Boogie Children."<ref>{{cite web |title=Chambers Brothers – Boogie Children (1973) |url=https://www.discogs.com/Chambers-Brothers-Boogie-Children/release/2988685 |website=Discogs}}</ref>

=== Solo career ===
In 1973, James signed with [[A&M Records]], where his first single under the name Rick James, "My Mama", was released in 1974, becoming a club hit in Europe.<ref name="glowreview" />

In 1976, James returned to Buffalo and formed the Stone City Band. Shortly thereafter, he recorded "Get Up and Dance!", his second single to be released. In 1977, James and the Stone City Band signed a contract with Motown's Gordy Records imprint, where they began recording their first album in New York City.

In April 1978, James released his debut solo album, ''[[Come Get It!]]'', which included the Stone City Band. The album launched the top 20 hit, "[[You and I (Rick James song)|You and I]]", which became his first number-one R&B hit. The album also included the hit single, "[[Mary Jane (Rick James song)|Mary Jane]]". It eventually sold two million copies, launching James's musical career to stardom, and helping out Motown Records at a time when label fortunes had dwindled.<ref name=":4">{{Cite book|last1=Jones|first1=Bob|url=https://archive.org/details/michaeljacksonma00jone|url-access=registration|quote=sold over 1 million copies.

A third album, ''[[Fire It Up (Rick James album)|Fire It Up]]'', was released in late 1979 going [[Recording Industry Association of America certification|gold]]. Around that same period, James launched his first headlining tour, the Fire It Up Tour, and agreed to invite the then-upcoming artist, [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], as well as singer [[Teena Marie]], as his opening act.<ref name="glowreview" /> James had produced Marie's successful Motown debut album, ''[[Wild and Peaceful (Teena Marie album)|Wild and Peaceful]]'' and was featured on the hit duet, "I'm a Sucker (For Your Love)". James was credited with naming Marie, "Lady Tee", on the song, a nickname that stuck with Marie for the rest of her career. The Fire It Up tour led to James developing a bitter rivalry with Prince, after he accused the musician of ripping off his act.<ref name="glowreview" />

Following the end of the tour in 1980, James released the ballads-heavy ''[[Garden of Love (album)|Garden of Love]]'', which became his fourth gold record. In 1981, James recorded his best-selling album to date, ''[[Street Songs (album)|Street Songs]]'', which like his previous four albums, was a [[concept album]]. ''Street Songs'' featured a fusion mix of different genres, including rock and [[new wave music|new wave]], as well as James's brand of crossover funk, enabling James's own style of "punk funk". The album featured hit singles such as "[[Ghetto Life (song)|Ghetto Life]]", the Teena Marie duet "Fire and Desire", "[[Give It to Me Baby]]", and his biggest crossover hit to date, "[[Super Freak]]", which peaked at number 16 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and sold over 1 million copies. ''Street Songs'' peaked at number one R&B and number three pop, and sold over 3&nbsp;million copies alone in the United States.<ref name=":4" /> Following up that success, James released two more gold albums, 1982's ''[[Throwin' Down]]'' and 1983's ''[[Cold Blooded (Rick James album)|Cold Blooded]]''.

During this period, when Prince also became a success as a producer of other acts including [[The Time (band)|The Time]] and [[Vanity 6]], James launched the acts Process and the Doo-Rags, and the [[Mary Jane Girls]], featuring his former background singer Joanne "JoJo" McDuffie as the lead vocalist and background performer, finding success with the latter group, due to the hits, "[[All Night Long (Mary Jane Girls song)|All Night Long]]", "Candy Man", and "[[In My House]]". In 1982, James produced the Temptations' Top 10 R&B hit, "[[Standing On The Top (song)|Standing on the Top]]". In 1983, James recorded the hit duet, "Ebony Eyes", with singer [[Smokey Robinson]], as well as a ballad "Tell Me What You Want" with an introduction by Billy Dee Williams. In 1985, James produced another hit for entertainer [[Eddie Murphy]] with the song "[[Party All the Time]]". That same year he appeared on an episode of ''[[The A-Team]]'' with [[Isaac Hayes]]. After the release of his ninth solo album, ''[[The Flag (album)|The Flag]]'', in 1986, James signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which released the album ''[[Wonderful (Rick James album)|Wonderful]]'' in 1988, featuring the hit, "Loosey's Rap".

James's controversial and provocative image became troublesome sometimes. Famous for promoting the use of [[marijuana]] live in concerts during a time that simple possession could lead to a long term prison sentence, James was often threatened by cops in various cities that he would be arrested if he smoked marijuana on stage during performances of songs such as "Fire It Up" and "Mary Jane". According to Kerry Gordy, most Motown executives erroneously thought the latter song was a "simple cute love song to a girl" not knowing the song was about marijuana.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

James' overtly sexual bravado made it tough for him to be a bigger mainstream act. After the debut of the fledgling music video network [[MTV]] in August 1981, James tried to present the music video to "Super Freak" to the label, only for the channel to turn the video down. James accused the network of racism.{{sfn|Denisof|1988|pp=69–71}} MTV denied this, stating the real reason "Super Freak" was turned down by MTV was because they felt James' video was too vulgar for the channel. When younger artists such as [[Michael Jackson]] and Prince found fame on the channel, James accused the two singers of being "tokens" in a 1983 interview, demanding that any black artist that has a video aired on MTV take their video off the channel in protest. James' rant was cosigned by [[David Bowie]], who argued with MTV [[VJ (media personality)|VJ]] [[Mark Goodman]] about the lack of black artists being featured on the channel despite the successes of Jackson and Nelson.{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

When MTV and [[BET]] both avoided playing the video for "Loosey's Rap" because of its graphic sexual content, James considered the networks hypocritical in light of them still playing provocative videos by artists such as [[Madonna]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2020}}

=== Decline ===
In 1989, James's 11th album, ''[[Kickin' (Rick James album)|Kickin'<nowiki/>]]'', was released only in the UK. By 1990, he had lost his deal with Warner Bros. and James began struggling with personal and legal troubles. That year [[MC Hammer]] released his hit [[signature song]], "[[U Can't Touch This]]", which sampled the prominent opening riff from "Super Freak." James and his co-writer on "Super Freak," Alonzo Miller, successfully sued Hammer for shared songwriting credit and all three consequently received a Grammy Award for Best R&B Song in 1991.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=August 20, 1990|title=M.C.

In 1997, James released ''[[Urban Rapsody]]'', his first album since his release from prison on assault charges, and he toured to promote the album. That same year, he discussed his life and career in interviews for the [[VH1]] musical documentary series, ''[[Behind the Music]]'', which aired in early 1998. James's musical career slowed again after he suffered a minor stroke during a concert in 1998.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=https://apnews.com/b734c5d05c630152d9a395674b02c7ca|title=Singer Rick James Suffers Stroke|last=Wilson|first=Jeff|date=November 10, 1998|work=Associated Press|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> He was featured on the song "Love Gravy" with [[Ike Turner]] for the 1998 soundtrack album ''[[Chef Aid: The South Park Album]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-1998-11-24-1998328047-story.html|title=Not for the faint of heart Review: You'll be happy to know star-studded 'Chef Aid' lives down to the tastelessness of 'South Park.'|last=Considine|first=J.

===Resurgence<!--I'm Rick James bitch links here-->===

====''Chappelle's Show''====
In early 2004, after years out of the spotlight, James participated in a [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] on ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', in a segment called "Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories." James and [[Charlie Murphy|Murphy]] recounted humorous stories of their experiences together during the early 1980s. During the sketch, James's character, played by [[Dave Chappelle]], utters the now famous catchphrase, "I'm Rick James, bitch!" The sketches were punctuated by James, explaining his past behavior with the phrase, "Cocaine is a hell of a drug!"

James enjoyed a career revival after his appearance on the show. He supported Teena Marie's tour of her album ''La Doña'' and toured with her in May 2004; playing with her at the [[KBLX-FM|KBLX]] Stone Soul Picnic, [[Pioneer Amphitheatre]], [[Hayward, California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/rick-james-performs-at-the-7th-annual-stone-soul-picnic-on-news-photo/51149124|title=Rick James Performs at the 7Th Annual Stone Soul Picnic… Nieuwsfoto's &#124; Getty Images Nederland &#124; 51149124|date=May 31, 2004|publisher=Gettyimages.com|access-date=April 13, 2012}}</ref> James gave his last public appearance and performance at the fourth annual [[BET Awards]] on June 29, 2004. He performed a live rendition of "Fire & Desire" with Teena Marie. James called out a girl backstage who didn't recognize him by saying, "Never mind who you thought I was, I'm Rick James, bitch!" The audience erupted and gave James a standing ovation as he walked off the stage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musictimes.com/articles/14912/20141108/5-shocking-hip-hop-award-show-moments-rick-james-suge.htm|title=5 Shocking Hip-Hop Award Show Moments: Rick James, Suge Knight, Diana Ross And More [WATCH]|date=November 8, 2014 |website=Music Times|language=en}}</ref>

=== Autobiography ===
At the time of his death, James was working on an autobiography, ''[[The Confessions of Rick James|The Confessions of Rick James: Memoirs of a Super Freak]]'', as well as a new album. The book was finally published in 2007 by Colossus Books and features a picture of his tombstone. Noted music journalist/biographer [[David Ritz]], who had been employed by James to work on the book with him, later said that this version did not truly reflect how the musician wanted himself portrayed. In 2014, Ritz published his own, re-edited version, ''Glow: The Autobiography of Rick James''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2014/07/07/glow-the-autobiography-of-rick-james/11927085/|title=Autobiography 'Glow' is bright with Rick James' legacy|last=Seymour|first=Gene|date=July 7, 2014|website=USA Today|language=en-US}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Relationships and children===
James had two children with Syville Morgan, a former singer and songwriter. They had a daughter, Tyenza, and a son, Rick Jr.

James dated actress [[Linda Blair]] from 1982 to 1984. They met after James read an interview where Blair called him sexy. He contacted her and spent time getting to know the actress during a short stint living at the [[Chateau Marmont]] in Hollywood.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.com/archive/despite-a-frightening-collapse-funkstar-rick-james-wont-let-anyone-rein-him-in-vol-18-no-21/|title=Despite a Frightening Collapse, Funkstar Rick James Won't Let Anyone Rein Him in|last=Levin|first=Eric|date=November 22, 1982|website=People|language=en|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Early in their relationship, Blair became pregnant and had an abortion. James wrote in his memoir, "I loved Linda and it hurt me that she would choose to abort our child without even wanting to talk to me about it first.

In 1989, James met 17-year-old party-goer Tanya Hijazi. The two began a romance in 1990. In 1993, the couple had their only child and James's youngest, Tazman. Following their respective releases from prison for assaulting Mary Sauger and Frances Alley,<ref name="MORAN">{{cite news|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1993-08-31-me-29801-story.html|title=Woman Recounts Tale of Abuse at James Trial|last=Moran|first=Julio|date=August 31, 1993|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref><ref name="articles.latimes.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1991-08-03-me-242-story.html|title=Pop Singer Arrested on Torture, Drug Charges|first1=Aaron|last1=Curtiss|first2=Jack|last2=Cheevers |name-list-style=amp|date=August 3, 1991 |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> they married in 1996 and divorced in 2002.

James was very close with Teena Marie, whom he met and began collaborating with in 1979. Teena Marie stated they were engaged "for two weeks."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/28/top-10-little-known-facts-about-teena-marie/ |title=Top 10 little known facts about Teena Marie |work=CNN Entertainment |date=December 28, 2010 |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> Their professional partnership lasted into 2004, when Marie released her comeback album, ''[[La Doña (album)|La Doña]]'', which included her and James's duet "I Got You".

===Friendships===
James had a close friendship with Eddie Murphy, whom he met in 1981. He was also close to Murphy's older brother Charlie Murphy, who worked as a security guard for his brother. On the [[Rick James#Chappelle's Show|Chappelle show skits]], Charlie Murphy recalled occasions of mistreatment by James.

James was good friends with actress [[Debbie Allen]]. Allen once invited James to a Broadway show and sent a car to pick him up; during the show, James fell asleep due to exhaustion from prior sexual activities. Afterwards, Allen confronted him in the dressing room. She pinned him down and pleaded that he was throwing his life away. "All you do is get high and have sex," she said. He promised to change his ways, but he broke his promise that same night.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" />

James was also a friend of fellow Motown act performers Smokey Robinson and Marvin Gaye, singers James idolized as a teenager. Additionally, he befriended Gaye's second wife, Janis, and he was godfather of Gaye's daughter [[Nona Gaye|Nona]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2005/10/11/acting-singing-the-gospel-truth-for-nona-gaye/|title=Acting, singing the 'Gospel' truth for Nona Gaye|last=Wilson-Combs|first=Lana K.|date=October 11, 2005|website=East Bay Times|language=en-US}}</ref> James's relationship with Robinson began shortly after James signed with Motown and, in 1983, the duo recorded the hit "Ebony Eyes".

James also idolized former Temptations lead singer [[David Ruffin]] and Ruffin's self-proclaimed cousin, bass vocalist [[Melvin Franklin]], and grabbed at the chance to produce the hit "[[Standing on the Top]]" for them in 1982. Before that, the then-current lineup of the group recorded background vocals on two James-associated projects—James's ''Street Songs'' (singing "Ghetto Life" and "Super Freak") and Teena Marie's ''[[It Must Be Magic]]'' (singing on the title track). In "Super Freak", "It Must Be Magic", and "Standing on the Top", James famously shouted out, "Temptations, SING!"{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Drug abuse and health problems===
James' [[Substance dependence|drug abuse]] began in his teens, first with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and heroin.<ref name="glowreview" /> He began using [[cocaine]] in the late 1960s. His [[Cocaine dependence|cocaine addiction]] increased by the 1980s, and he began [[Free base|freebasing]] by the end of the decade. When he smoked [[crack cocaine]] in his [[Beverly Hills]] mansion, he often put aluminum foil on the windows to block onlookers.<ref name="glowreview" /> Although James claimed that he quit cocaine when he entered prison, his autopsy showed there was a small amount of the drug in his bloodstream at the time of his death.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1491032/rick-james-had-nine-different-drugs-in-his-system-when-he-died/ |title=Rick James Had Nine Different Drugs in His System When He Died |work=MTV News |date=September 17, 2004 |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref>

His drug use led to major health problems. In April 1984, he was hospitalized after being found unconscious in the middle of his house by a friend.<ref name=hospital>{{cite magazine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D7MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61 |title=Singer Rick James Admitted to Buffalo, N.Y.

===Kidnapping and assault convictions===
By the 1990s, James' drug use was public knowledge. He was heavily addicted to cocaine and later admitted to spending about $7,000 per week on drugs for five years straight. On August 2, 1991, James and his girlfriend Tanya Hijazi were arrested on charges of holding 24-year-old Frances Alley hostage for up to six days, tying her up, forcing her to perform sexual acts, and burning her legs and abdomen with the hot end of a crack cocaine pipe during a week-long cocaine binge.<ref name="articles.latimes.com"/><ref>{{Cite magazine|date=August 19, 1991|title=Rick James, Girlfriend Are Accused Of Burning, Sexually Abusing Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I7wDAAAAMBAJ&lpg=PA60|magazine=Jet|page=60|issn=0021-5996|via=Google Books}}</ref> James faced a maximum sentence of life in prison if convicted on all charges, which included assault with a deadly weapon, aggravated [[Mayhem (crime)|mayhem]], [[torture]], forcible [[Oral sex|oral copulation]], [[false imprisonment]] and [[kidnapping]].<ref name="MORAN" />

On November 3, 1992, while out on bail for that incident, James, under the influence of cocaine, assaulted music executive Mary Sauger at the [[Sunset Tower|St. James Club and Hotel]] in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]. Sauger claims she met James and Hijazi for a business meeting, but said the two then kidnapped and beat her over a 20-hour period.<ref name="MORAN" />

James was found guilty of both offenses but was cleared of a torture charge that could have put him in prison for the rest of his life. While serving his five-year sentence at [[Folsom State Prison|Folsom Prison]], James lost a [[Lawsuit|civil suit]] to Sauger, who was awarded nearly $2&nbsp;million in damages in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reprints.longform.org/rick-james-super-freak-sager |title=The Rise and Fall of a Super Freak |website=Reprints.longform.org |last=Sager |first=Mike |access-date=November 28, 2019}}</ref> James was ordered to pay her about $1&nbsp;million; the hotel and a private security firm were found liable for nearly $750,000 in damages due to negligence.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/12/09/Singer-Rick-James-victim-wins-18M/8534786949200/|title=Singer Rick James' victim wins $1.8M|date=December 9, 1994|website=UPI}}</ref> James was released from prison on August 21, 1996 after serving more than two years.<ref>{{Cite news| url = http://www.eonline.com/news/33502/rick-james-gets-out-of-jail-his-fianc-e-goes-in|title= Rick James Gets Out of Jail, His Fiancée Goes In |first= Marcus |last=Errico |work=[[E!]] Online |date =  August 23, 1996 }}</ref>
