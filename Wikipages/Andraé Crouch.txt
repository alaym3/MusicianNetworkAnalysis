== Early years ==

Andraé Edward Crouch was born, along with his twin sister, [[Sandra Crouch|Sandra]], on July 1, 1942, in San Francisco, California<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tributes.com/obituary/read/Andra%C3%A9-Crouch-102052107 | title=Andrae Crouch Obituary | publisher=The Associated Press | access-date=April 5, 2015 | author=Rober Jablon}}</ref> to parents Benjamin and Catherine (née Hodnett) Crouch.<ref name="CM_Vol_51"/> His father was a minister in the Church of God in Christ ([[COGIC]]) and pastored Christ Memorial Church of God in Christ in Pacoima, California. When he was young, Crouch's parents owned and operated Crouch Cleaners, a dry-cleaning business, as well as a restaurant business in [[Los Angeles]], California.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-04-11/local/me-291_1_sandra-crouch | title=Catherine D. Crouch; Singers' Mother | work=Los Angeles Times | date=April 11, 1992 | access-date=January 8, 2015}}</ref> In addition to running the family's businesses, Crouch's parents also had a Christian street-preaching ministry and a hospital and prison ministry.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-23/local/me-4746_1_christ-memorial-church | title=Benjamin Crouch; Church Founder | work=Los Angeles Times | date=December 23, 1993 | access-date=January 8, 2015}}</ref> When Crouch was 11, his father was invited to speak for several weeks at a small church as a guest preacher. Crouch's father and the church's congregation encouraged the young boy to play during the services. At the piano, Crouch found the key in which the congregation was singing and started to play. After this, Crouch honed his piano-playing skills and, in time, wanted to write his own music. When he was 14 years old, he wrote his first Gospel song.<ref name="Brian Mansfield"/><ref name="Booth, John D. 1974, p. 3">Booth, John D., The Music of Andrae Crouch and the Disciples.

== Career ==

=== Groups ===

Crouch's first group musical effort was formed in 1960 as the Church of God in Christ Singers. The group included future recording artist and session musician [[Billy Preston]] on keyboards<ref name="CM_Vol_51"/> and was the first to record Crouch's song "The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power". The song's popularity grew following the initial 1969 recording, becoming a standard in churches and hymnals worldwide.<ref name="Variety obit"/> While attending [[Los Angeles Valley College|Valley Junior College]] in the San Fernando Valley to become a teacher, he formed gospel music group "The Disciples" in 1965 with fellow musicians Perry Morgan, Reuben Fernandez, and Bili Thedford.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gmahalloffame.org/site/andrae-crouch/ | title=Andre Crouch Biography | publisher=Gospel Music Association Hall of Fame | access-date=January 9, 2015 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150109234121/http://www.gmahalloffame.org/site/andrae-crouch/ | archive-date=January 9, 2015 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The group became a frequent attraction at "Monday Night Sing" concerts in southern California put on by Audrey Mieir, a Christian minister and music composer who frequently sponsored new Christian music groups.<ref name="Carpenter, Bil 2005, page 107"/> Following Mieir's introduction of Crouch to [[Manna Music Inc|Manna Music Publishing's]] founders Tim and Hal Spencer, Manna published Crouch's song "The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power", written when he was 15 years old. The Spencers helped launch Crouch's recording career by introducing them to [[Light Records]] founder and prolific Christian songwriter [[Ralph Carmichael]]. After the addition of [[Sherman Andrus]] to The Disciples, Light Records recorded and released the group's first album, ''Take the Message Everywhere'', in 1968.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MXNMAgAAQBAJ&q=andrae%20crouch%20Mieir%20tim%20spencer&pg=PA57 |title=This is My Story: 146 of the World's Greatest Gospel Singers |publisher=Thomas Nelson |work=This Is My Story: 146 of the World's Greatest Gospel Singers; Andrae Crouch |date=September 26, 2005 |access-date=January 9, 2015 |author=Thomas Nelson |pages=57 |isbn=9780529110329 }}</ref> Following the group's first album release, Crouch's twin sister, Sandra, joined The Disciples in 1970 after Fernandez' departure.

When Sherman Andrus left the Disciples to join [[the Imperials]], he was replaced by singer [[Danniebelle Hall]]. More musicians were being added and the group's membership by the early 1970s included Fletch Wiley on trumpet, Harlan Rogers on keyboards, Hadley Hockensmith on bass, and Bill Maxwell on drums.<ref name="Carpenter, Bil 2005, page 107"/> The group appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' in 1972<ref name="Carpenter, Bil 2005, page 107"/> and to sold-out crowds at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1975 and 1979.<ref name="LA Times obit">{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/la-me-andrae-crouch-20150109-story.html | title=Andrae Crouch, Grammy-winning gospel singer and pioneer, dies at 72 | work=Los Angeles Times | date=January 8, 2015 | access-date=January 9, 2015 | author=Steve Chawkins}}</ref> Crouch's most popular songs with the group included "The Blood Will Never Lose Its Power", "Through It All", "Bless His Holy Name", "Soon and Very Soon", "Jesus is the Answer", and "My Tribute".

=== Solo career ===

After The Disciples disbanded in 1979, Crouch continued on with a solo career. His backing ensemble included Howard Smith, Linda McCrary, [[Táta Vega]], and [[Kristle Murden]], along with The Andraé Crouch Singers. [[Joe Sample]], Wilton Felder, Dean Parks, [[David Paich]], [[Phillip Bailey]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[El DeBarge]], and other secular artists were included in Crouch's recording sessions. With former Disciples drummer-turned-producer Bill Maxwell, Crouch co-produced projects for [[The Winans]], Danniebelle Hall, and Kristle Murden. Many musical acts and solo performers covered his more popular works, including [[Elvis Presley]] with "I've Got Confidence". In 1986, Crouch composed the theme music for the [[Sherman Hemsley]] sitcom ''[[Amen (TV series)|Amen]]'', sung by [[Vanessa Bell Armstrong]].

In 2006 Crouch released ''[[Mighty Wind]]'', a 40th anniversary album featuring guest performances by [[Lauren Evans]], [[Crystal Lewis]], [[Karen Clark Sheard]], Táta Vega, and [[Marvin Winans]].

=== Influence ===

Crouch has been credited as a key figure in [[Jesus music]] of the 1960s and 1970s and, as a result, helping to bring about [[contemporary Christian music]] into the church.<ref name="NYT Obit, influence">{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/08/us/ap-us-obit-andrae-crouch.html | title=Andrae Crouch, Legendary Gospel Figure, Dies at 72 | work=New York Times | date=January 9, 2015 | access-date=January 10, 2015 | agency=Associated Press}}</ref> As well, he is also credited with helping to bridge the gap between black and white [[Christian music]] and revolutionizing the sound of [[urban Gospel]] music. Though sometimes criticized for diluting the Christian message by using contemporary music styles, his songs have become staples in churches and hymnals around the world and have been recorded by mainstream artists such as Elvis Presley and [[Paul Simon]].<ref name="CM_Vol_51"/>

His affiliation with Light Records was instrumental in bringing Walter and [[Tramaine Hawkins]], [[Jessy Dixon]] and [[The Winans]] to the label, from where they all enjoyed successful gospel music careers.<ref name="L.

Michael Gipson}}</ref>

In 1996, Crouch and his music were honored on the [[Grammy Award]]-winning CD, ''Tribute: The Songs of Andraé Crouch'', released by Warner Bros. Records. The album featured a wide range of artists performing Crouch's classic songs and featured [[Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir|the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir]], [[Take 6]], [[Twila Paris]], and [[Michael W.
