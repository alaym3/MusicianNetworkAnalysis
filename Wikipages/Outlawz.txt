==Later years==
Shortly after joining the group, Mopreme and Big Syke severed all ties with Death Row and left the Outlawz for financial and personal reasons.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Two months after the death of Shakur, Kadafi was killed in a housing project in New Jersey; after two years, Napoleon convinced his cousin to turn himself in for shooting Kadafi.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Though Tupac had told them specifically to never sign to [[Death Row Records]] and were originally going to sign to Makaveli Records, but after his death, the leftover members of the Outlawz decided to do just that.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} As a result, Fatal left the group, claiming they were not being loyal to 2Pac.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Napoleon left the group due to his conversion to Islam and is now traveling all around the globe to spread the teachings of Islam.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} While managing and working on her solo project, Tupac was looking for solo deals for Storm. And Young Noble as well.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} She left the group around late 1998.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The Outlawz are also known for their longtime relationship with [[Brooklyn]]'s [[Boot Camp Clik]], a relationship that begun as a result of 2Pac's friendship with Boot Camp's [[Smif-n-Wessun]] and [[Buckshot (rapper)|Boot Camp Clik]], while working on the yet unreleased "One Nation" album.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Despite stylistic differences and divergent fanbases, the two crews maintained connections on the basis of personal relationships.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Members of the Outlawz were featured on Boot Camp releases like Heltah Skeltah's "Magnum Force" and Rock's "Veterans' Day."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 1999, the Outlawz released their first album as a group with original unreleased recordings of 2Pac, entitled ''[[Still I Rise (album)|Still I Rise]]''. The album was released on [[Death Row Records]]. Member Hussein Fatal did not appear on any of the album as he was edited out of the original recordings due to issues with the record labels.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Storm was also edited out of some of the original recordings for unknown reasons.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Original member Big Syke also appeared on the album. It wasn't until late 2000, though, that they finally got the go-ahead to release their debut album, ''[[Ride Wit Us Or Collide Wit Us]]''.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Unfortunately, the album didn't prove to be much of a success, and neither did the group's follow-up album a year later, ''Novakane'', also released on the group's Outlaw Recordz label (distributed by Koch). In 2008 they signed a short deal with [[Young Buck]]'s [[Ca$hville Records]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} In 2009, Kastro had confirmed he had left the Outlawz to pursue a solo career.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} He reunited with the group on Outlaw The Lost Songs Volume 1 & 2 in March 2010.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Later the members went to release solo albums and collaborations with other artists.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2009, the Outlawz reunited with former member Hussein Fatal, who had left the group following the deaths of Makaveli and Kadafi.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The Outlawz sixth studio album ''[[Perfect Timing (Outlawz album)|Perfect Timing]]'' was released on September 13, 2011 on [[Outlaw Recordz|1Nation Entertainment]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} The album features guest appearances from many big name rappers including [[Bun B]], [[Tech N9ne]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], [[Krayzie Bone]], [[Young Buck]], [[Lloyd (singer)|Lloyd]], among others and production from [[Focus...]], Cozmo, [[Max Perry|Maxwell Smart]], The Network and CyFyre.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2011, some of the remaining members of The Outlawz made peace with longtime rival enemy Lil Cease of Junior Mafia.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} They both recorded a track called "Bury the Hatchet", on a [[DJ Kay Slay]] album.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} They also confirmed the longstanding rumor that they smoked Tupac's ashes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/outlawz-confirm-they-smoked-tupacs-ashes_n_942106|title=The Outlawz Insist They Smoked Tupac|first=Mallika|last=Rao|date=August 30, 2011|website=HuffPost.com|access-date=April 1, 2020}}</ref>
