===2006: Career beginnings and ''American Idol''===
Before appearing on ''American Idol'', Sparks participated in and won such talent competitions as Coca-Cola's Rising Star, the Gospel Music Association Academy's Overall Spotlight Award, ''[[America's Most Talented Kid]]s'', [[Colgate Country Showdown]], and the ''2006 Drug Free AZ Superstar Search''. From the time Jordin was nine years old until her win as American Idol 2007, her maternal grandmother, Pam Wiedmann, managed her. Prior to ''Idol'', Sparks frequently performed the national anthem at various local sporting events, notably for the [[Phoenix Suns]], [[Arizona Cardinals]], and [[Arizona Diamondbacks]]. Sparks also appeared with [[Alice Cooper]] in his 2004 Christmas show and toured with Christian contemporary singer [[Michael W. Smith]] in 2006. In 2006, Sparks was one of six winners of the Phoenix [[Torrid (clothing retailer)|Torrid]] search for the "Next Plus Size Model". She was flown to California, where she was featured in Torrid ads and promotional pieces.<ref name="torrid">{{cite web|url=http://www.torrid.com/community/model_search_winners_phoenix.asp|title=Torrid Model Search winner|access-date=October 1, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304072443/http://www.torrid.com/community/model_search_winners_phoenix.asp|archive-date=March 4, 2007}}</ref> A full-page ad for Torrid featuring Sparks ran in the December 2006 issue of ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine.

In the summer of 2006, at the age of 16, Sparks auditioned twice for the [[American Idol (season 6)|sixth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]'': once in [[Los Angeles]] but failed to make it past the first round;<ref>{{cite web|last=Addict |first=Idol |url=http://americanidol1thatuwant.blogspot.com/2007/05/jordin-sparks-interviews.html |title=Jordin Sparks interview |publisher=Americanidol1thatuwant.blogspot.com |date=May 28, 2007 |access-date=October 18, 2011}}</ref> and again in [[Seattle]] after winning ''Arizona Idol'', a talent competition conducted by Phoenix Fox station [[KSAZ-TV]]. The Seattle audition is the one seen in the January 17, 2007, broadcast of ''American Idol'', in which she earned a "gold ticket" and the right to appear in the Hollywood Round. ''American Idol'' judge [[Randy Jackson]] made the offhand prediction that "Curly hair will win this year."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/01192007/news/nationalnews/idol_sparks_plug_nationalnews_adam_buckman.htm |title='Idol' Sparks Plug |work=New York Post |date=January 19, 2007 |access-date=August 30, 2009 |first=Adam |last=Buckman |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090314071112/http://www.nypost.com/seven/01192007/news/nationalnews/idol_sparks_plug_nationalnews_adam_buckman.htm |archive-date=March 14, 2009 }}</ref> While on the show, Sparks gained a loyal fan base known as "Sparkplugs". On May 23, 2007, at the age of 17, Sparks won the sixth season of ''American Idol''. She remains the youngest winner in ''American Idol'' history. Cowell said, "Jordin was the most improved over the whole season – didn't start the best, but midway through this was the girl who suddenly got momentum." He included that "Young girl, likeable, and the singer won over the entertainer [Lewis]."<ref name="jordinsparks?l">{{cite web |title=Jordin Sparks?

Tour 2007]] from July 6 to September 23, 2007, along with other contestants in the top ten.

Since her win in 2007, Sparks has returned to ''Idol'' six times. She performed twice on the [[American Idol (season 7)|seventh season]] of ''American Idol'', once on the [[Idol Gives Back]] results show singing "[[No Air]]" with [[Chris Brown (American singer)|Chris Brown]] and again with "[[One Step at a Time (Jordin Sparks song)|One Step at a Time]]" on May 21, 2008, for the finale. She performed "[[Battlefield (song)|Battlefield]]" on the May 13, 2009, episode of ''American Idol''.

The following year, Sparks took part in a tribute to [[Simon Cowell]] with other former contestants at the [[American Idol (season 9)|ninth season]] finale on May 26, 2010. During the [[American Idol (season 10)|tenth season]], Sparks performed her new song "[[I Am Woman (Jordin Sparks song)|I Am Woman]]" on the Top 4 results show.  She appeared on the finale of the [[American Idol (season 11)|eleventh season]] singing "You'll Never Walk Alone" alongside that year's fourth-place contestant [[Hollie Cavanagh]]. Sparks was the most recent female to win the competition until the [[American Idol (season 12)|twelfth season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2013/04/12/american-idol-lazaro-arbos-sent-home-making-idol-history/|title='American Idol': Lazaro Arbos sent home, making 'Idol' history|publisher=Fox News|date=April 12, 2013|access-date=April 12, 2013}}</ref> In a comedic clip on the finale, "We Were Sabotaged", the boys of the twelfth season realize that she was the "mastermind" behind the girls' sabotage because it was five years since a girl had won.
