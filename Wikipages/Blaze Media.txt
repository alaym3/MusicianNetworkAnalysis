Beck announced the creation of an online-only network that would replace Insider Extreme as a result of his [[Fox News]] departure on June 7, 2011. On September 12, 2011, Beck launched GBTV (Glenn Beck TV) as an exclusive [[internet streaming]] network, produced and operated by Mercury Radio Arts. GBTV would air a television adaptation of his [[Glenn Beck Radio Program|radio show]], his [[Glenn Beck Program|television show]], and other original programming, including ''[[Real News|Real News from TheBlaze]]'', a nightly news program hosted by former [[CNN]] personality [[Amy Holmes]].<ref>{{cite web|website = The Huffington Post|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/09/amy-holmes-joins-glenn-be_n_922739.html|title = Amy Holmes Joins Glenn Beck's GBTV Network As Anchor|date = August 9, 2011|access-date=2020-10-28}}</ref> On June 18, 2012, Mercury Radio Arts announced the consolidation of all of its outlets under the "TheBlaze" brand, thus renaming the internet television station from GBTV to TheBlaze.<ref>{{cite web|last=Krakauer|first=Steve |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/18/showbiz/glenn-beck-web-tv-network/index.html |title=Glenn Beck drops his name from Web network, promises media 'revolution' |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 18, 2012 |access-date=September 1, 2013}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Dish Network]] placed TheBlaze on its channel lineup. As a result of the "Get TheBlaze" campaign (a movement led by supporters to have other supporters call their cable or satellite television provider and ask them to carry the channel), several smaller, regional cable operators also have recently picked up TheBlaze—including [[Cablevision]] (also known as Optimum TV – Channel 828), a major cable provider in the [[New York metropolitan area]].<ref name="morecableoperators">{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/28/theblaze-tv-launching-on-4-more-cable-operators|title=TheBlaze TV Launching on 4 More Cable Operators|website=TheBlaze|first=Madeleine|last=Morgenstern|date=March 28, 2013|access-date=March 28, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130328180115/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/03/28/theblaze-tv-launching-on-4-more-cable-operators/|archive-date=March 28, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="extendsreach">{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/01/theblaze-extends-its-reach-announces-tv-deal-with-tri-state-cable-provider|title=TheBlaze Extends Its Reach, Announces TV Deal With Tri-State (NY, NJ, CT) Cable Provider|website=TheBlaze|first=Becket|last=Adams|date=May 1, 2013|access-date=May 1, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503104604/http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/01/theblaze-extends-its-reach-announces-tv-deal-with-tri-state-cable-provider/|archive-date=May 3, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>
