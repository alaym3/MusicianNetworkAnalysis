'''The Good Life''' is an [[indie rock]] band on [[Saddle Creek]] records.

Started as a solo project of [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]]'s frontman [[Tim Kasher]], The Good Life quickly grew to become its own established group. The original intent of The Good Life was to provide Tim Kasher with a vehicle to perform songs that did not fit stylistically in with his long-running band Cursive. Kasher fronts the group and plays the part of the singer/songwriter.  The other members of the band include [[Stefanie Drootin]], [[Ryan Fox (musician)|Ryan Fox]], and [[Roger Lewis (musician)|Roger Lewis]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Good Life » Bio|url = http://www.thegoodlifemusic.com/bio/|website = www.thegoodlifemusic.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}</ref>  

The Good Life has its core in those four musicians, but besides Kasher can be a rotating cast of characters involving many from [[Saddle Creek Records]]. The band's name came from the [[The Good Life (slogan)|original state slogan for Nebraska]], the home of Kasher and Saddle Creek, before 2003, when the slogan was changed.

The Good Life released their fifth album, ''[[Everybody's Coming Down]],'' on August 14, 2015.
