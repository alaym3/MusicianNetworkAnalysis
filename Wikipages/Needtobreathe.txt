==Categorization==
Needtobreathe self-identifies as a rock band, but is often categorized as a [[Christian rock]] band as well. The band has been signed to mainstream labels, formerly to Atlantic Records, and releasing their latest record under the [[Elektra Records]] label. The band experiences success on contemporary hit radio stations, Christian adult contemporary stations, and at the Gospel Music Association Dove Awards, despite releasing a number of songs with no direct mention of their Christian faith.<ref name="ROLL">Jon Freeman, [https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/needtobreathe-talk-christian-stigma-experimental-new-lp-w435672 "Needtobreathe Talk Christian-Band Stigma, Experimental New LP"], ''Rolling Stone'', August 23, 2016.</ref><ref>Taylor Weatherby, [https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7865951/needtobreathe-hardlove-deluxe-vinyl-new-songs "NEEDTOBREATHE Announce Deluxe Vinyl Edition of 'HARDLOVE' & New EP: Listen to Two Tracks"], ''Billboard'', July 14, 2017.</ref> The band has also toured with artists outside of the Christian rock genre, including Train, Taylor Swift, and Tim McGraw.<ref name="auto1"/>

The band has resisted labels as specific as such in the past, explaining to ''Rolling Stone'' in 2016 in the following statement, "any label is limiting. That one in particular is especially limiting. To me, I think people pass over the band all the time because they read that....I hate the idea that they somehow feel like I didn't make the music for them, that we didn't play music for everyone. Christian record deals came and we said no to all of them. Waited a couple years until the right record deal came, which was Atlantic, which we've been on ever since. But we just said to them in passing when we first started, we want the records to be available to everyone."<ref name="ROLL" />
