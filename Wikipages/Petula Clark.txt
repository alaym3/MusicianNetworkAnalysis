'''Petula Sally Olwen Clark''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (born 15 November 1932) is a British singer, actress, and [[composer]].

Clark's professional career began during the [[Second World War]] as a child entertainer on [[BBC Radio]]. In 1954 she charted with "[[The Little Shoemaker]]", the first of her big UK hits, and within two years she began recording in [[French language|French]]. Her international successes have included "[[(Now and Then There's) A Fool Such as I|''Prends mon coeur'']]", "[[Sailor (song)|Sailor]]" (a UK number one), "[[Romeo (Petula Clark song)|Romeo]]", and "[[I Will Follow Him|Chariot]]". Hits in [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] followed. In late 1964 Clark's success extended to the United States  with a four-year run of career-defining, often upbeat singles, many written or co-written by [[Tony Hatch]] and [[Jackie Trent]]. These songs include her signature song "[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]" and "[[I Know a Place]]", "[[My Love (Petula Clark song)|My Love]]", "[[Sign of the Times (Petula Clark song)|A Sign of the Times]]", "[[I Couldn't Live Without Your Love]]", "[[Who Am I? (Petula Clark song)|Who Am I]]", "[[Colour My World (Petula Clark song)|Colour My World]]", "[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]" (by [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]]), "[[Don't Sleep in the Subway]]", "[[The Other Man's Grass Is Always Greener]]", and "[[Kiss Me Goodbye (Petula Clark song)|Kiss Me Goodbye]]". In the United States Clark was sometimes called "the First Lady of the [[British Invasion]]". Clark has sold more than 68 million records.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.petulaclark.net/bio.html |title=Mini-Biography |publisher=Petula Clark.net |date=28 October 2000 |access-date=18 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071923/http://www.petulaclark.net/bio.html |archive-date=24 September 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> She has also enjoyed success in the musical film ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' and in the stage musicals ''[[The Sound of Music]]'', ''[[Blood Brothers (musical)|Blood Brothers]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''.

== Life and career ==
Clark was born to Doris (''née'' Phillips) and Leslie Noah Clark in [[Ewell]], [[Surrey]], England on 15 November 1932. Both of Clark's parents were nurses at [[Long Grove Hospital]] in Epsom. Clark's mother had Welsh ancestry and her father was English. Sally's stage name "Petula" was invented by her father, who joked that it was a combination of the names of two former girlfriends, Pet and Ulla.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/petula-facts-2284174 |title=Petula facts |date=25 January 2007 |website=walesonline |access-date=8 May 2020}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]] Clark lived with her sister at the home of their grandparents in [[Abercanaid]], near [[Merthyr Tydfil]],{{citation needed|date=February 2021}}, a small stone house with no electricity or running water, and a toilet at the bottom of the garden. Her grandfather was a coal miner.<ref>{{cite news|first=Busola |last=Evans |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/sep/06/petula-clark-my-family-values |title=Petula Clark: My family values &#124; Life and style |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 2013-09-06|access-date=24 June 2017}}</ref> Her first ever live audience was at the Colliers' Arms in [[Abercanaid]], near [[Merthyr Tydfil]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/local-news/petula-clark-goes-downtown-2272209 |title=Petula Clark goes downtown |publisher=Wales Online |date= February 2007|access-date=24 June 2017}}</ref> She also recalls living just outside London during the Blitz and watching the dogfights in the air and running to air-raid shelters with her sister. Later, when she was eight, she joined other children to record messages with the BBC to be broadcast to members of their families in the forces. The recording event was in the Criterion Theatre, an underground theatre that was safe. When the air-raid siren went off other children were upset and a call went out for someone to step forward and sing to calm them. Petula volunteered, and they liked her voice so much, in the control room they recorded her. Her song was "Mighty Rose".<ref>BBC documentary Dancing through the Blitz, 2015</ref>

As a child Clark sang in the [[chapel]] [[choir]] and showed a talent for [[mimicry]], impersonating [[Vera Lynn]], [[Carmen Miranda]] and [[Sophie Tucker]] for her family and friends.<ref>Kon, Andrea, ''This is My Song: A Biography of Petula Clark''. London: W.H. Allen & Co. Ltd. 1983 {{ISBN|0-491-02898-9}}, pp. 23, 37–38</ref> Her father introduced her to theatre in 1944 when he took her to see [[Flora Robson]] in a production of ''[[Mary Stuart (play)|Mary Stuart]]''; she later recalled that after the performance, "I made up my mind then and there I was going to be an actress. ... I wanted to be [[Ingrid Bergman]] more than anything else in the world."<ref>Kon, pp. 22–23</ref> Her first public performances were as a singer, however: she performed with an orchestra in the entrance hall of [[Bentalls|Bentall's Department Store]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]] for a tin of [[toffee]] and a gold wristwatch, in 1945.<ref>Kon, pp. 26–27</ref>

===Career start===
[[File:Petula Clark b.jpg|thumb|Petula arrives in the Netherlands, 1960]]
From a chance beginning at the age of seven Clark appeared on radio, in film, in print, on television and on recordings. In October 1942 the nine-year-old Clark made her radio debut while attending a BBC broadcast with her father. She was trying to send a message to an uncle who was stationed overseas, but the broadcast was delayed by an [[The Blitz|air raid]]. During the bombing the producer requested that someone perform to settle the jittery theatre audience and she volunteered a rendering of "[[Mighty Lak' a Rose]]" to an enthusiastic response. She then repeated her performance for the broadcast audience, launching a series of some 500 appearances in programmes designed to entertain the troops.<ref>{{YouTube|DF58vg-TWpg|Clark's rendition of "Mighty Lak' a Rose"}} (accessed 23 April 2011).</ref> In addition to radio work, Clark frequently toured the United Kingdom with fellow child performer [[Julie Andrews]]. Nicknamed the "Singing Sweetheart", she performed for [[George VI]], [[Winston Churchill]] and [[Bernard Montgomery]]. She also became known as "Britain's [[Shirley Temple]]",<ref name=pc29/> and was considered a mascot by the [[British Army]], some of whose troops plastered her photos on their tanks for good luck as they advanced into battle.<ref>Kon, p. 54</ref>

While she was performing at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London in 1944 Clark was discovered by the film director [[Maurice Elvey]], who cast her, at the age of 12, as the precocious orphaned waif Irma in his war drama ''[[Medal for the General]]''. In quick succession she performed in ''[[Strawberry Roan (1945 film)|Strawberry Roan]]'', ''[[I Know Where I'm Going!]]'', ''[[London Town (1946 film)|London Town]]'', ''[[Here Come the Huggetts]]'', ''[[Vote for Huggett]]'' and ''[[The Huggetts Abroad]]'', the second, third and fourth of four [[The Huggetts (film series)|Huggett Family films]]. Although some of the films she made in the UK during the 1940s and 1950s were [[B-film]]s,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} she worked with [[Anthony Newley]] in ''[[Vice Versa (1948 film)|Vice Versa]]'' (directed by [[Peter Ustinov]]) and [[Alec Guinness]] in ''[[The Card (1952 film)|The Card]]''. She also had a small role in ''I Know Where I'm Going''.

In 1945 Clark was featured in the comic ''[[Radio Fun]]'', in which she was billed as "Radio's Merry Mimic".<ref>''The Penguin Book of Comics'' by George Perry and Alan Aldridge, 1967</ref> By then Clark felt that she had played child parts for too long.<ref name=pc29>{{Pop Chronicles |29|2}}</ref>

In 1946 Clark began her television career with an appearance on a BBC variety show, ''Cabaret Cartoons'', which led to her being signed to host her own afternoon series, ''Petula Clark''. ''Pet's Parlour'' followed in 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.petulaclark.net/tv/british50.html|title=British Television Appearances – The Fifties|work=Petula Clark|access-date=2020-11-17}}</ref>

In 1947 Clark met [[Joe "Mr Piano" Henderson]] at the Peter Maurice Publishing Company. The two collaborated musically and were linked romantically over the following ten years. In 1949 Henderson introduced Clark to the record producer [[Alan A. Freeman]], who, together with her father Leslie, formed [[Polygon Records]], for which she recorded her earliest hits. Clark had recorded her first release that year, "Put Your Shoes On, Lucy", for [[EMI]], and further recordings with vocalist Benny Lee on Decca. The Polygon label was financed with part of Clark's earnings. She scored a number of major hits in the UK during the 1950s, including "[[The Little Shoemaker]]" (1954), "Majorca" (1955), "[[Suddenly There's a Valley]]" (1955) and "[[With All My Heart]]" (1956). "The Little Shoemaker" was an international hit, reaching number one in [[Australia]], the first of many number-one records in her career.

Near the end of 1955 Polygon Records was sold to Nixa Records, then part of [[Pye Records]], leading to the establishment of [[Pye Nixa Records]] (subsequently simply Pye). This effectively signed Clark to the Pye label in the UK, for which she recorded until the early 1970s.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

During this period Clark showed a keen interest in encouraging new talent. She suggested that Henderson be allowed to record his own music, and he had five chart hits on Polygon/Pye between 1955 and 1960.

===European fame===
[[File:Petula Clark Com L15-0036-0001-0009.tif|thumb|Petula Clark in Zurich (1966)]]
In 1957 Clark was invited to appear at the [[Olympia (Paris)|Paris Olympia]], where, despite her misgivings and a bad cold, she was received with acclaim. The following day she was invited to the office of Vogue Records to discuss a contract. There she met her future longtime publicist, collaborator and husband Claude Wolff. Clark was attracted immediately, and when she was told that she would be working with him if she signed with the Vogue label she agreed.<ref name="Kon, pp. 122–125">Kon, pp. 122–125</ref>

In 1960 she embarked on a concert tour of France and [[Belgium]] with [[Sacha Distel]], who remained a close friend until his death in 2004.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Gradually she moved further into the continent, recording in [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].

While Clark focused on her new career in France she continued to achieve hit records in the UK into the early 1960s. Her 1961 recording of "Sailor" became her first number-one hit in the UK, while such follow-up recordings as "[[Romeo (Petula Clark song)|Romeo]]" and "My Friend the Sea" landed her in the British Top-10 later that year. "Romeo" sold more than one million copies around the world and won her her first [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]], which was awarded by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

Her recordings of several [[Serge Gainsbourg]] songs were also big sellers. In addition, she was given at this time a present of the song "Un Enfant" by [[Jacques Brel]], with whom she toured. Clark is one of only a handful of performers to be given a song by Brel. A live recording of this song charted in [[Canada]].

In 1963 Clark wrote the soundtrack for the French crime film ''A Couteaux Tirés'' (''Daggers Drawn'') - released in 1964 - and made a cameo appearance as herself in the film. Although it was only a mild success,{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} it added a new dimension—that of film composer—to her career. Additional film scores she composed include ''Entre ciel et mer'' (1963), ''Rêves d'enfant'' (1964), ''La bande à Bebel'' (1966),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinema.encyclopedie.personnalites.bifi.fr/imprime/imprime.php?pk=14033 |title=Charles Gérard - Cinémathèque Française |access-date=18 February 2021}}</ref> and ''Pétain'' (1989). Six themes from the last were released on the CD ''In Her Own Write'' in 2007.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

She was the subject of ''[[This Is Your Life (UK TV series)|This Is Your Life]]'' in February 1964, and twice more, in April 1975 and March 1996, becoming the only person to receive the television tribute three times.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

===International fame – the "Downtown" era===
By 1964 Clark's British recording career was foundering. Composer/arranger [[Tony Hatch]], who had been assisting her with her work for [[Disques Vogue|Vogue Records]] in France and [[Pye Records]] in the UK, flew to her home in Paris with new song material he hoped would interest her, but she found none of it appealing.<ref name=Hatch /> Desperate, he played for her a few chords of an incomplete song that had been inspired by his recent first trip to New York City. Upon hearing the melody, Clark told him that if he could write lyrics as good as the melody, she wanted to record the tune as her next single—"[[Downtown (Petula Clark song)|Downtown]]".<ref>Kon, pp. 157–158</ref> Hatch has subsequently denied originally offering "Downtown" to [[the Drifters]].<ref name=Hatch>{{cite news|first=Dave |last=Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/oct/11/petula-clark-tony-hatch-how-we-made-downtown |title=Petula Clark: how we made Downtown &#124; Music |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 2016-10-11|access-date=24 June 2017}}</ref>

Neither Clark, who was performing in Canada when the song first received major air play,<ref>''Legends: Petula Clark—Blue Lady'', broadcast on [[BBC Four]] 19 November 2006</ref> nor Hatch realised the impact the song would have on their respective careers. Released in four separate languages in late 1964, "Downtown" was a success in the UK, France (in both the English and the French versions), the Netherlands, Germany, Australia, and Italy, and [[Rhodesia]], Japan, and India, as well. During a visit to London, [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]] executive Joe Smith heard it and acquired the rights for the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/petula-clark/downtown|title=Downtown by Petula Clark|website=songfacts.com|access-date=July 1, 2019}}</ref><ref>"Exploding" by Stan Cornyn, Harper Collins 2002, p. 58.</ref> "Downtown" went to number one on the American charts in January 1965, and 3 million copies were sold in the [[United States]].

"Downtown" was the first of 15 consecutive Top-40 hits Clark achieved in the U.S., including "[[I Know a Place]]", "[[My Love (Petula Clark song)|My Love]]" (her second US number-one hit), "[[Sign of the Times (Petula Clark song)|A Sign of the Times]]", "[[I Couldn't Live Without Your Love]]", "[[This Is My Song (1967 song)|This Is My Song]]" (from the [[Charles Chaplin]] film ''[[A Countess from Hong Kong]]''), and "[[Don't Sleep in the Subway]]".<ref name=pc29/> The American recording industry honored her with [[Grammy Award]]s for [[7th Grammy Awards#Pop|Best Rock & Roll Recording of 1964]] for "Downtown" and for [[8th Grammy Awards#Pop|Best Contemporary (R&R) Vocal Performance of 1965 – Female]] for "I Know a Place". In 2004, her recording of "Downtown" was inducted into the [[List of Grammy Hall of Fame Award recipients A–D|Grammy Hall of Fame]].

[[File:Advertisement for Petula Clark's first American television special.jpg|left|thumb|Ad for the 1968 NBC-TV special that sparked controversy even before it aired]]
Clark's recording successes led to frequent appearances on American variety programmes hosted by [[Ed Sullivan]] and [[Dean Martin]], guest shots on ''[[Hullabaloo (TV series)|Hullabaloo]],'' ''[[Shindig!]]'', ''The Kraft Music Hall'', and ''[[The Hollywood Palace]]'', and inclusion in musical specials such as ''The Best on Record'' and ''[[Rodgers and Hart]] Today.''

[[File:Petula Clark holding Harry Belafonte's arm (1968).jpg|right|thumb|Clark holding [[Harry Belafonte|Belafonte's]] arm]]
In 1968 [[NBC-TV]] invited Clark to host her own special in the US, and in doing so, she inadvertently made television history. While singing a [[duet]] of "On the Path of Glory", an [[antiwar]] song that she had composed, with guest [[Harry Belafonte]], she took hold of his arm, to the dismay of a representative from the [[Chrysler]] Corporation (the show's sponsor), who feared that the moment would incur racial backlash from [[Southern United States|Southern]] viewers.<ref>"Auto Aide Relieved in Belafonte Case", in ''[[the New York Times]]'', published 11 March 1968</ref> When he insisted that they substitute a different take, with Clark and Belafonte standing well away from each other, Clark and the executive producer of the show—her husband, Wolff—refused, destroyed all other takes of the song, and delivered the finished programme to NBC with the touch intact.<ref>"Belafonte and Petula Clark Touch a Sponsor's Nerve", by Bob Williams, in the ''[[New York Post]]''; 6 March 1968</ref><ref>"Incident at TV Taping Irks Belafonte", by Robert E.

She starred in the [[BBC]] television series ''[[This Is Petula Clark]]'', which aired from mid-1966 to early 1968.

Clark revived her film career in the late 1960s, starring in two big musical films. In ''[[Finian's Rainbow (1968 film)|Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1968), she starred opposite [[Fred Astaire]], and she was nominated for the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]] for her performance. The following year, she was cast with [[Peter O'Toole]] in ''[[Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1969 film)|Goodbye, Mr. Chips]]'' (1969), a musical [[adaptation]] of the classic [[James Hilton (novelist)|James Hilton]] [[novella]].

Throughout the late 1960s Clark toured in concerts in the U.S., and she often appeared in [[supper club]]s such as the [[Copacabana (nightclub)|Copacabana]] in New York City, the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel's Cocoanut Grove]] in Los Angeles, and the Empire Room at the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]].

During this period Clark continued her interest in encouraging new talent. These efforts also supported the launch of [[Herb Alpert]] and his [[A&M Records|A&M]] record label. In 1968 she brought the French composer/arranger [[Michel Colombier]] to the U.S. to work as her [[musical director]], and introduced him to Alpert.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} Colombier went on to co-write the [[film score]] for ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]]'' with [[Prince (artist)|Prince]], composed the acclaimed pop symphony ''Wings'', and a number of [[soundtrack]]s for American films. [[Richard Carpenter (musician)|Richard Carpenter]] credited her with bringing his sister [[Karen Carpenter|Karen]] and him to Alpert's attention when they performed at a premiere party for the 1969 ''Goodbye, Mr. Chips''.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Clark has recalled that she and [[Karen Carpenter]] went to see [[Elvis Presley]] perform in [[Las Vegas]] and that afterwards "He was flirting with both of us, (saying) 'Wow, the two biggest girl pop stars in my dressing room. That's pretty good'... He didn't have us, exactly, but he had a darned good try. Not going to talk about that any more."<ref name=CBSSundayMorning />

Clark was one of the backing vocalists on [[John Lennon]]'s [[Plastic Ono Band]] ''[[Give Peace a Chance]]''. Clark was performing in [[Montreal]] in June 1969, and was being heckled by the audience due to her bilingual performance. Clark went to see Lennon for advice on dealing with this, as his wife Yoko Ono and he were staying at the city's [[Queen Elizabeth Hotel]] during their [[Bed-ins for Peace]] protest. Clark subsequently ended up on the recording of ''Give Peace a Chance.''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/feb/20/30-minutes-with-petula-clark|title=30 Minutes with Petula Clark|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=10 December 2016|date=2013-02-20|last1=Cragg|first1=Michael}}</ref>

===1970–2000===
During the early 1970s Clark had chart singles on both sides of the Atlantic with "Melody Man" (1970), "The Song of My Life" (1971), "I Don't Know How To Love Him" (1972), "The Wedding Song (There Is Love)" (1972), and "Loving Arms" (1974). In Canada, "''Je Voudrais Qu'il Soit Malheureux''" was a major hit.

Clark continued touring during the 1970s, performing in clubs in the US and Europe. During this period, Clark also appeared in print and radio ads for the [[Coca-Cola]] Corporation, television commercials for [[Plymouth automobile]]s, print and TV spots for [[Burlington Industries]], television and print ads for Chrysler Sunbeam, and print ads for Sanderson Wallpaper in the UK.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In the mid-1970s Clark scaled back her career  to devote more time to her family. On 31 December 1976, she performed her hit song "Downtown" on [[BBC1]]'s ''[[A Jubilee of Music]]'', celebrating British popular music for [[Queen Elizabeth II]]'s impending [[Silver Jubilee]]. She also hosted the television series ''[[The Sound of Petula]]'' (1972–74), and through the 1970s, made numerous guest appearances on variety, comedy, and game-show television programmes.

In 1980 Clark made her last film appearance, in the British production ''[[Never Never Land (film)|Never Never Land]]''. Her last television appearance was acting in the 1981 French miniseries ''[[Sans Famille]]'' (''An Orphan's Tale'').

A 1981 single, "Natural Love", reached number 66 on ''Billboard''{{'}}s Hot 100 chart and number 20 on the US country singles chart in early 1982.

===Personal life===
In 1955 Clark became linked romantically with [[Joe "Mr Piano" Henderson]]. Speculation that the couple planned to marry became rife. However, with the increasing glare of the public spotlight and Clark's growing fame—her career in France was just beginning—Henderson, reportedly not wanting to end up as "Mr. Petula Clark", decided to end the relationship.<ref>Kon, pp. 119–120</ref> Their professional relationship continued for a few years, culminating in the BBC Radio series ''Pet and Mr. Piano'', the last time they worked together,<ref>Kon, p. 130</ref> although they remained on friendly terms. In 1962, he penned a ballad about their break-up, called "There's Nothing More To Say", for Clark's LP ''In Other Words''. In 1967 in [[Las Vegas]], she was witness to the wedding of her friend, [[France|French]] singer [[Charles Aznavour]] alongside [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]

In October 1957 Clark was invited to appear at the [[Paris Olympia]] for the Europe N°1 live radio show ''Musicorama''. The next day, she was invited to the office of Vogue Records' chairman Léon Cabat to discuss recording in French and working in France. There, she met her future husband, [[publicist]] Claude Wolff, to whom she was attracted immediately, and when she was told that he would work with her if she recorded in French, she agreed.<ref name="Kon, pp. 122–125"/>  They have two daughters and a son.<ref name=CBSSundayMorning>{{cite news |url = https://www.cbs.com/shows/cbs-sunday-morning/video/6Aa0FLd8YtWeEdKp5SojM_VaH5bc6Ypy/petula-clark-still-on-the-road/ | title = Petula Clark, still on the road | last1 = Miller | first1 = Michelle | author-link1 = Michelle Miller | work = [[CBS Sunday Morning]] | publisher = [[CBS]] | date = December 24, 2017 | access-date = April 11, 2019 | via = [[CBS Interactive]]}}</ref>
