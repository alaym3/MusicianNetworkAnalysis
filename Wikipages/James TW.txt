James' father, who plays guitar in a wedding band as a hobby, once found young James playing on the drum kit at home. Shortly thereafter, the band's drummer wasn't able to make it to a gig. So the band had a decision to make: either let 10 year-old James play or cancel the gig. James played that evening and has been performing on a regular basis ever since. He picked up guitar at 12 years old and started playing piano the following year. In 2010, James started his [https://www.youtube.com/user/zealmusicltd YouTube channel] at 12 years old.<ref name="James TW" /><ref name="AXS" />
