==Biography ==

===Early life===
Patty was born in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]], into a family of musicians; her father was a minister of music, and her mother served as the church pianist. She first performed at the age of two when she sang "[[Jesus Loves Me]]" for her church, Phoenix First [[Church of God (Anderson, Indiana)|Church of God]]. First growing up in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], then [[San Diego]], she and her brothers joined their parents in a performing group known as "The Ron Patty Family", and sang at churches nationwide during summer holidays. After graduating from [[Will C. Crawford High School|Crawford High School]] in San Diego, she attended [[San Diego State University]] and [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson University]] in [[Anderson, Indiana|Anderson]], [[Indiana]], where she studied voice with soprano Greta Dominic, but graduated with an emphasis in conducting. While studying at [[Anderson University (Indiana)|Anderson University]], she worked as a studio musician for area recording studios, singing background vocals and recording commercial jingles, including one for [[Juicy Fruit]] gum.<ref>{{Citation|last=MrClassicAds1970s|title=Juicy Fruit Chewing Gum commercial 1979|date=April 14, 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ppBCsHhKpI|access-date=August 4, 2017|archive-date=December 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191207165744/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ppBCsHhKpI|url-status=live}}</ref> Her reputation as a performer and studio singer grew during the late 1970s, and it was during this time that she initiated contact with legendary Christian musician [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Singing career===
Patty recorded her first album, ''For My Friends'', an independent effort, that landed in the hands of executives at Singspiration! records. In 1979, she was signed to Singspiration! and released her first professional record, ''Sandi's Song''. According to the FAQ section on her website, the name on her birth certificate is ''Sandra Patty''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sandipatty.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=47 |title=Sandi Patty - Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=sandipatty.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513201609/http://www.sandipatty.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=18&Itemid=47 |archive-date=May 13, 2007 }}</ref> A printer's error on the labeling listed her name as Sandi Patti, and she used this moniker as her stage name for the next fifteen years, before correcting it to ''Sandi Patty''.

Patty's career expanded after she won her first two [[GMA Dove Awards]] in 1982 and began singing backup for [[Bill Gaither (gospel singer)|Bill Gaither]] and the [[Bill Gaither Trio]]. She headlined her first national tour in 1984 and reached national acclaim after her rendition of "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" was included during the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Statue of Liberty re-dedication broadcast on July 6, 1986. This exposure led to multiple mainstream television appearances including ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', Christmas in Washington, [[Walt Disney]]'s Fourth of July Extravaganza, and the [[Pepsi 400|1998 Pepsi 400]]; the clip was frequently used on television sign-offs for the remainder of their existence. She was invited to sing the national anthem at the [[Indianapolis 500]] in 1987–88, 1990–92, and once again in 2013.

In 1990, Patty's inspirational single release, "I'll Give You Peace",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://auth.discogs.com/login?service=https%3A//www.discogs.com/login%3Freturn_to%3D%252Frelease%252Fedit%252F5980829%253F&nologin=1&locale=None|title=Discogs Login|website=auth.discogs.com|access-date=July 4, 2019|archive-date=December 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201220223857/https://auth.discogs.com/login?service=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.discogs.com%2Flogin%3Freturn_to%3D%252Frelease%252Fedit%252F5980829%253F&nologin=1&locale=None|url-status=live}}</ref> written by Constant Change aka Dawn Thomas and Thomas Yarbrough, was released on one of her most popular records, entitled, "Another Time, Another Place", which peaked at #2 on the Christian billboard charts. At the peak of her career, Patty's concerts were so heavily attended that she performed in often sold-out mainstream arenas and concert halls across the United States. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, she averaged over 200 concerts a year and supported a staff of over 30 that managed her career. During this period of time Patty was noted, often critically, as the highest-paid singer in the Christian music industry averaging over $100,000 per appearance, largely due to massive touring and high-profile public appearances.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780385243537|title=Sandi Patti : the voice of gospel|last=Don.|first=Cusic|date=1988|publisher=Doubleday|isbn=9780385243537|edition=1st|location=New York|oclc=16900959|url-access=registration}}</ref>

===Divorce===
In 1992, the news of Patty's divorce from manager John Helvering shocked the gospel music industry. The reason for the split was later revealed to be [[infidelity]], which subsequently stalled her career in the mid 1990s. It was later reported that during her marriage she had an extramarital affair with her backup singer, Don Peslis, who was also married at the time. Patty divorced Helvering in 1993 and married Peslis in August 1995.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morgan|first=Timothy C.|title=Sandi Patty Stages Comeback|url=http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/1998/january12/8t156a.html|publisher=Christianity Today|access-date=May 31, 2012|archive-date=March 1, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301133826/http://www.ctlibrary.com/ct/1998/january12/8t156a.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Confronted with rumors of the affair just two weeks into her marriage with Peslis, Patty made a full confession to her church congregation.<ref>{{cite web|last=Long|first=James|title=The Art of Forgiveness|url=http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/sandi-patty/features/the-art-of-forgiveness/|publisher=Todays Christian Music|access-date=April 17, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504064240/http://www.todayschristianmusic.com/artists/sandi-patty/features/the-art-of-forgiveness/|archive-date=May 4, 2013}}</ref> During this time, Patty received support from national figure, [[Charles Schulz]], the creator of the [[Peanuts]] comic strip. He referenced her in a comic strip, and Patty is quoted in a recent spiritual biography of Schulz as having been touched by the gesture.<ref>Lind, Stephen J. "A Charlie Brown Religion: Exploring the Spiritual Life and Work of Charles M. Schulz" Jackson, MS: University Press of Mississippi, 2015</ref>

===Comeback===
Patty slowly rebuilt her career by expanding her musical appeal, which included pop concert performances with symphony orchestras including the [[New York Symphony Orchestra]], [[Boston Symphony Orchestra]], [[Prague Symphony Orchestra]], [[London Symphony Orchestra]], [[Atlanta Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Cincinnati Pops]], and the [[Dallas Symphony]] as well as headlining and hosting the Yuletide Celebration with the [[Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra]] in 2000, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2010, 2013, and 2015 under the direction of Maestro Jack Everly. Patty again hosted the extravaganza in December 2017.

In both interviews and in her autobiography, ''Broken on the Back Row'', Patty expressed remorse and took full responsibility for her past actions, revealing the steps she took in seeking forgiveness from those that her actions most affected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/2003/sepoct/5.60.html |title=The Long Road Home |author=Eric Reed |publisher=Christianity Today |access-date=May 9, 2009 |archive-date=April 12, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412162508/http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/2003/sepoct/5.60.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbn.com/entertainment/music/ANS_SandiPatty.aspx |title=Second Chances |author=Dan Wooding |publisher=CBN.com |access-date=May 9, 2009 |archive-date=June 14, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080614225509/http://cbn.com/entertainment/music/ANS_SandiPatty.aspx |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2000, Patty had a guest singing appearance at the end of a ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]'' episode (season 4, episode 20). She appeared in the 2006 annual [[Macy's]] Thanksgiving Day Parade in [[New York City|New York]]. A televised performance of ''Sandi Patty's Yuletide Special'' was filmed for [[broadcast syndication|syndication]] in 2006, with other performers—including the [[Mormon Tabernacle Choir]] and the [[U.S. Air Force]] Reserve Band.

In 2004, Patty was inducted into the [[Gospel Music Hall of Fame]] and in 2007 was awarded the GMA [[Music in the Rockies]] Summit Award.

In May 2008, Patty released her 30th studio recording, ''Songs for the Journey'', in which she covers classic hymns of the church and other modern gospel classics. 2008 also saw the release of five separate compilation recordings of past songs taken from previous albums. In 2009, Patty received two GMA Dove Award nominations: Female Vocalist of the Year, and Inspirational Album of the Year (''Songs for the Journey'').

''Simply Sandi'', an acoustic album, is the first solo project to be released on her own record label, Stylos Records (a label with three artists—Sandi, [[Ben Utecht]], and [[Heather Payne]]). It was released on May 5, 2009. This album includes new renditions of some of Sandi's most beloved songs including "In Heaven's Eyes", "Via Dolorosa" and "The Stage is Bare". [[Warner Music Group|WEA Distribution]] is the distributor for Stylos Records, although this album is not being released commercially.

In Fall 2009, Patty released her first live Christmas album entitled ''Christmas: LIVE''. The album includes live performances of her past Christmas favorites including "O Holy Night", "Someday", and a duet with her husband Don Peslis in "The Prayer".

===2010–present===
In late 2010, Patty released ''The Edge of the Divine''. The album featured eight new songs, including a duet with [[Heather Payne]]. A book of the same name was also released with the sub-title "Where Possibility Meets God's Faithfulness."

In October 2011, Patty released ''Broadway Stories,'' which capitalized on Patty's pops concerts popularity. From iTunes Review: "Before Sandi Patty was a Christian music star, she developed her craft by performing stage standards and pop tunes from the Great American Songbook. Broadway Stories reaffirms her mastery of such material against gorgeous backdrops provided by the 64-piece Prague Symphony Orchestra. From the first track to the last, Patty shows an easy command of the Broadway idiom, applying her formidable pipes to material worthy of her talents."{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

In January 2012, Patty starred as Dolly Levi in the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra's world premiere concert stage version of the Broadway musical, "Hello, Dolly!" to rave reviews.

In 2012 and 2013, Patty was a judge and mentor for the Songbook Academy, a summer intensive for high school students operated by the [[Great American Songbook Foundation]] and founded by [[Michael Feinstein]].<ref>http://www.broadwayworld.com/indianapolis/article/Michael-Feinstein-Sylvia-McNair-et-al-to-Judge-Songbook-Vocal-Competition-612-20120604 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924064904/http://www.broadwayworld.com/indianapolis/article/Michael-Feinstein-Sylvia-McNair-et-al-to-Judge-Songbook-Vocal-Competition-612-20120604 |date=September 24, 2015 }} broadwayworld.com Retrieved July 21, 2015</ref>
