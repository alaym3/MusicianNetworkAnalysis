Retrieved 16 September 2007.</ref> (born 2 March 1988) is an Australian [[pop rock]] singer and the daughter of the late Australian music promoter [[Michael Gudinski]], [[Order of Australia|AM]]. Alexa first hit the spotlight in 2004 when her song "[[Always There (Kate Alexa song)|Always There]]" was featured in the [[Seven Network|Channel 7]] series ''[[Home and Away]]''. After supporting the [[Backstreet Boys]] on their Australia tour, her third single "[[All I Hear]]" shot straight into the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA]] top ten, and stayed inside the top twenty for eight weeks.

==Background==
Alexa's career began when she was thirteen and wrote her first song, then the following year she started doing demos.<ref name="biography">[http://www.katealexa.com/ Official website "About Kate"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516105537/http://www.katealexa.com/ |date=16 May 2006 }}. ''Katealexa.com''. Retrieved 16 September 2007.</ref> "Colors of the Rainbow" was the first song she recorded, stating "It's a really fun song, but I don't think I'm ever going to play it for anyone".<ref name="biography"/>

She then went on to sign a [[Recording contract|record deal]] with her father's label, [[Liberation Music]], in mid-2004.

==Music career==

===''Broken & Beautiful'' (2004–06)===
In 2004, when Alexa was in year eleven of [[high school]], her debut single "[[Always There (Kate Alexa song)|Always There]]", was selected to be the soundtrack to Channel Seven's ''[[Home and Away]]'' promos during the 2004 [[Olympic Games]]. This provided valuable promotion for Alexa, with many viewers wanting to know more about the song. This was very rewarding for her as the song was very meaningful to her.<ref name="biography"/>

In 2005, Alexa was finishing year twelve at [[Melbourne Girls Grammar School]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Whole school notices | work = Daily Bulletin | publisher = MGGS | date = 5 October 2005 | url = http://artman.mggs.vic.edu.au/publish/article_177.shtml | accessdate = 5 November 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> (studying [[Photography]], [[English studies|English]], Legal Studies and IT) when she released her second single, "[[My Day Will Come]]"; a song about seizing the moment, it was another top-thirty hit.<ref name="biography"/> That same year, she graduated from high school knowing the importance of finishing school and deciding music is what she wanted to do forever.<ref name="biography"/>

On her eighteenth birthday in 2006 she released her third single, "[[All I Hear]]". As she celebrated, she found out she had glandular fever and because of this she was unable to do much promotion for the song.<ref name="biography"/> The song peaked at number nine on the Australian [[ARIA Singles Chart]] and Alexa states "Having a top Ten hit was just an unbelievable feeling. It meant so much to me that people were promoting the song".<ref name="biography"/>

On 4 September 2006, Alexa released her fourth single "[[Somebody Out There]]" which was another top-thirty hit for her, and on 23 September 2006 Alexa released her long-awaited debut album ''[[Broken & Beautiful (Kate Alexa album)|Broken & Beautiful]]'' and described the album as a reflection of her life and journey over the past few years, and claims that everything on the album is true.<ref name="biography"/>

===Gap between albums (2007–08)===
In 2007, Alexa wrote and recorded twelve original songs plus the theme song "Ordinary Girl" and two songs from ''Broken & Beautiful'' for the [[soundtrack]] of the Australian television series ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'' series two, also titled ''[[H2O: Just Add Water (2007 soundtrack)|H2O: Just Add Water]]''.

In late 2007, Alexa teamed up with Australian producer [[Molly Meldrum]] and American rapper [[Baby Bash]] to record a [[cover version]] of the [[Womack & Womack]] song "[[Teardrops (Womack & Womack song)|Teardrops]]", which was the first single released from Alexa's second studio album in 2008.<ref name="Liberation">[http://www.liberation.com.au/artists.cfm?id=44 "KATE ALEXA LATEST NEWS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720044121/http://www.liberation.com.au/artists.cfm?id=44 |date=20 July 2008 }}.

In February  and March 2008, Kate supported [[Cyndi Lauper]] on her national tour of Australia. Her setlist for the tour confirms three new songs that may appear on her second album, "Nothing Compares", "Cherry Pop", and "Hit by Love".<ref name="Kate's Tour Diary">[http://www.take40.com/artists/1014/tourdiary/Kate-Alexa "Kate's Tour Diary"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080627140045/http://www.take40.com/artists/1014/tourdiary/Kate-Alexa |date=27 June 2008 }}. ''Take40.com''. Retrieved 21 June 2008.</ref>

On 16 April 2008, ''[[Broken & Beautiful (Kate Alexa album)|Broken & Beautiful]]'' was released in Japan, with two bonus tracks, "Walk On" and an acoustic version of "Always There".<ref name="Broken & Beautiful Japan information">[http://www.towerrecords.co.jp/sitemap/CSfCardMain.jsp?GOODS_NO=1790202&GOODS_SORT_CD=101 "Information on the Japanese edition of ''Broken & Beautiful''"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090706073631/http://www.towerrecords.co.jp/sitemap/CSfCardMain.jsp?GOODS_NO=1790202&GOODS_SORT_CD=101 |date=6 July 2009 }}.

As of early 2008, Alexa has been working on her second studio album titled ''[[Infatuation (album)|Infatuation]]'', supposedly set for release in late 2008 but after numerous delays will now be released on 17 August 2012. Her official website states that she has come up with a new sound which she has described as "pop with an edge."<ref name="Kate Alexa Official Website">[http://www.katealexa.com/ Kate Alexa Official Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516105537/http://www.katealexa.com/ |date=16 May 2006 }} ''KateAlexa.com'' Retrieved 18 May 2009</ref>

Two singles and videos were released prior to the album in 2011, the title track and "X-Rated". Neither singles nor the album charted in Australia.
