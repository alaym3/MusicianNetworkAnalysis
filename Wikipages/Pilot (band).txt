'''Pilot''' were a Scottish [[Rock music|rock]] group, formed in 1973 in [[Edinburgh]] by [[David Paton]] and [[Billy Lyall]]. They are best known for their songs "[[January (Pilot song)|January]]", "[[Magic (Pilot song)|Magic]]", "Just A Smile" and "Call Me Round".

==Career==
Both Paton and Lyall had briefly been substitute members of the [[Bay City Rollers]] before that band's breakthrough. Joined by drummer [[Stuart Tosh]], the band recorded several demos during 1972 and 1974 at Craighall Studios, Edinburgh, where Billy Lyall was the resident engineer.<ref>{{Cite web|last=The Newsroom|title=The "magic" career of Pilot's David Paton|url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/whats-on/arts-and-entertainment/magic-career-pilots-david-paton-603394|url-status=live|access-date=4 October 2021|website=[[Edinburgh Evening News]]}}</ref> They were signed to a management contract with [[Nick Heath (producer)|Nick Heath]] and Tim Heath, sons of British bandleader [[Ted Heath (bandleader)|Ted Heath]], and John Cavanagh. In due course they signed to a worldwide recording deal with EMI Records. After the recording of their debut album, ''[[From the Album of the Same Name]]'', guitarist [[Ian Bairnson]] (who had played on the album as a [[session musician]]) joined the band permanently.

The 1974 single "[[Magic (Pilot song)|Magic]]" from their first album, produced by [[Alan Parsons]] and written by Lyall and Paton,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Pilot-Magic-Just-Let-Me-Be/release/1339141 |title=Pilot - Magic (Vinyl) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=4 June 2014}}</ref> was a No. 11 UK<ref name="British Hit Singles">{{cite book

It stayed at number one for three weeks. (It also went to number one in Australia where it stayed up top for eight weeks; in the United States, it reached the lower end of the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]].) However, the group failed to make the Top 30 again.<ref name="British Hit Singles"/> The arranger of "January", [[Andrew Powell]], went on to record [[Kate Bush]], and both Paton and Bairnson played on her debut album, ''[[The Kick Inside]]'', which included "[[Wuthering Heights (song)|Wuthering Heights]]".<ref name="500 Number One Hits">{{cite book

The band's other singles chart successes were "Call Me Round" and "Just a Smile" (both 1975), which each hit the top 40 in the UK and nowhere else.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums"/> By 1977, only Paton and Bairnson were left from the original foursome, and they recorded Pilot's final album (the aptly titled ''Two's a Crowd'') with session musicians, including [[Steve Swindells]], who later joined [[Hawklords]].

By 1978, all of Pilot's members had begun other projects, notably Tosh, Paton and Bairnson becoming members of [[the Alan Parsons Project]], and Tosh also working with [[10cc]].

Lyall left Pilot and in 1976, as William Lyall, released a solo LP, ''[https://www.discogs.com/William-Lyall-Solo-Casting/release/3106288 Solo Casting]'', which included contributions from Paton and Bairnson, with [[Phil Collins]] drumming on all but two tracks. The album is notable in that, not only did Lyall write all the songs and play keyboards and flute, but he also wrote all but two of the orchestral arrangements. Lyall died of AIDS-related causes in 1989.

Paton and Bairnson reconvened in 2002, to re-record the original Pilot album ''Two's a Crowd''. The subsequent issue was entitled ''Blue Yonder''.

As they approached the 40th anniversary of Pilot's debut album, Paton, Bairnson, and Tosh reunited as Pilot.  They released ''A Pilot Project'' in August 2014 as an homage to [[The Alan Parsons Project]] singer [[Eric Woolfson]].

In 2019, David Paton released a follow-up to ''A Pilot Project'', ''The Traveller - Another Pilot Project'',<ref>[http://www.anotherpilotproject.com Official website of ''Another Pilot Project'']</ref> sort of single-handedly. With a few exceptions, he recorded all the instruments himself.

In 2020, the label [[Cherry Red Records|Cherry Red]] (Rough Trade) released a 4 CD box set containing all 4 albums of the band plus some rare recordings as bonus tracks.

In July 2021, Pilot (Paton and Bairnson) released ''The Magic EP'', which features 4 completely re-recorded older songs: ''Magic'', ''January'', ''Just A Smile'' and ''Over The Moon''. The latter was completely rearranged for this purpose. According to the official website, the release of a new album is planned for the end of 2021.
