===2012-13: "Untouchable Lucki"===
Lucki's debut single and music video "Untouchable Lucki" was produced and premiered by music blog [http://elevatormag.com ELEVATOR].<ref>[http://www.elevatormag.com/lucki-ecks-untouchable-lucki-video-elevator/ ELEVATOR Premiere's Lucki Ecks - Untouchable Lucki Music Video]</ref> Lucki's music was first brought to ELEVATOR co-founder Bryan Zawlocki's attention by Lucki's friends Antoinne Bryant and Kevin Wright Jr, who at the time were interns for ELEVATOR. ELEVATOR subsequently produced Lucki's first two music videos "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOBP0khg5sU Untouchable]" and "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3slsRHFzp4 Everything Outside]", both directed by Bryan Zawlocki, alongside Antoinne Bryant and Kevin Wright Jr.

===2013–14: ''Alternative Trap'' and ''Body High''===

Teaming up with his close friend and producer Plu2o Nash and other producers, Lucki released his first project, titled ''[[Alternative Trap]]'' at the age of 17. Lucki garnered attention from multiple music blogs including ''Fake Shore Drive'', ''ELEVATOR'', ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' and ''[[Noisey]]'', because of his distinct flow and cadence, most prominent on his lead single "Count on Me", which garnered over 700,000 views on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VqcljJD9ZY|title=Lucki Eck$ - Count On Me (Official Video)|via=YouTube}} youtube.com.

After receiving attention from music blogs for his self-proclaimed "alternative trap" music, Lucki started receiving attention from other music artists as well. In July 2014, [[FKA Twigs]] collaborated with Lucki on a song titled "Ouch Ouch"; the collaboration was a celebration of Twigs' recent visit to Chicago, as she tends to collaborate with local artists when she travels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2014/07/lucki-ecks-ouch-ouch-video-feat-fka-twigs|title=Premiere: Watch Lucki Eck Complex.com.

In December 2014, Lucki collaborated with fellow Chicago musician [[Chance the Rapper]] and released a song titled "Stevie Wonder".

===2015–present: ''X'', ''Freewave EP'', ''Freewave 3'' and ''Almost There''===

After releasing his first single to his third project titled ''X'', Lucki continued to drop more songs from the mixtape in 2015; the other singles were "Lowlife" and "What I Wanna". Lucki released ''X'' on May 30, 2015, the day of his 19th birthday.

A few months later, Lucki started releasing freestyles to his [[extended play]] ''[[Freewave EP]]''. At first, they were single songs, but soon announced they were to be a part of the upcoming EP; he first released "Freewave Freestyle" and "Back Home", and soon followed with "Freewave 3, 4, 5, and 7". The EP consisted of ten songs, the tenth song titled "Rumors" was added a couple of weeks later.

In January 2016, Lucki announced his name change from Lucki Eck$ to Lucki when he released the first single to his then upcoming project, ''@ MIDNIGHT'', titled "Deja Vu", featuring fellow Chicago rapper Joey Purp. Lucki claimed that the Eck$ moniker was "childish" and that he has "grown" from the name.

Lucki released his debut studio album ''Freewave 3'' in February 2019. His fifth EP, ''Almost There'' was released on May 29, 2020, acting as a placeholder for fans until his next project. The EP received positive reviews.<ref name="Almost " /><ref name="here">{{Cite web|url=https://defpen.com/album-stream-lucki-almost-there/|title=Album Stream: Lucki – Almost There|work=Def Pen|last=Shepard|first=Ryan|date=May 29, 2020|accessdate=May 29, 2020}}</ref>
