The '''Oregon boundary dispute''' or the '''Oregon Question''' was a 19th-century [[territorial dispute]] over the political division of the [[Pacific Northwest]] of [[North America]] between several nations that had competing territorial and commercial aspirations over the region.

Expansionist competition into the region began in the 18th century, with participants including the [[Russian Empire]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], [[Spain]], and the [[United States]]. By the 1820s, both the Russians, through the [[Russo-American Treaty of 1824]] and the [[Russo-British Treaty of 1825]], and the Spanish, by the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819, formally withdrew their territorial claims in the region. Through these treaties the British and Americans gained residual territorial claims in the disputed area.{{sfn|Mackie|1997|p=29, 124–126, 140}} The remaining portion of the North American [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coast contested by the United Kingdom and the United States was defined as the following: west of the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], north of Mexico's [[Alta California]] border of [[42nd parallel north]], and south of [[Russian America]] at parallel 54°40′ north; typically this region was referred to as the [[Columbia District]] by the British and the [[Oregon Country]] by the Americans. The Oregon dispute began to become important in geopolitical diplomacy between the British Empire and the new American republic, especially after the [[War of 1812]].

In the [[1844 United States presidential election]], ending the Oregon Question by annexing the entire area was a position adopted by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Some scholars have claimed the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party's]] lack of interest in the issue was due to its relative insignificance among other more pressing domestic problems.{{sfn|Miles|1957}} Democratic candidate [[James K. Polk]] appealed to the popular theme of [[manifest destiny]] and [[expansionism|expansionist]] sentiment, defeating Whig [[Henry Clay]]. Polk sent the British government the previously offered partition along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]]. Subsequent negotiations faltered as the British plenipotentiaries still argued for a border along the Columbia River. Tensions grew as American expansionists like [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Edward A. Hannegan]] of [[Indiana]] and [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Leonard Henly Sims]] of [[Missouri]] urged Polk to annex the entire Pacific Northwest to the 54°40′ parallel north, as the Democrats had called for in the election. The turmoil gave rise to [[political slogan|slogans]] such as "Fifty-four Forty or Fight!" As relations with [[Mexico]] were rapidly deteriorating following the [[annexation of Texas]], the expansionist agenda of Polk and the Democratic Party created the possibility of two different, simultaneous wars for the United States. Just before the outbreak of the [[Mexican–American War]], Polk returned to his earlier position of a border along the 49th parallel.

The 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] established the border between [[British North America]] and the United States along the 49th parallel until the [[Strait of Georgia]], where the marine boundary curved south to exclude [[Vancouver Island]] and the [[Gulf Islands]] from the United States. As a result, a small portion of the [[Tsawwassen, British Columbia|Tsawwassen Peninsula]], [[Point Roberts, Washington|Point Roberts]], became an [[exclave]] of the United States. Vague wording in the treaty left the ownership of the [[San Juan Islands]] in doubt, as the division was to follow "through the middle of the said channel"<ref>[[s:Oregon Treaty|Oregon Treaty]] from Wikisource. Accessed 12 February 2015.</ref> to the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]]. During the so-called [[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]], both nations agreed to a joint military occupation of the islands. Kaiser [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] of the [[German Empire]] was selected as an arbitrator to end the dispute, with a three-man commission ruling in favor of the United States in 1872. There the [[Haro Strait]] became the border line, rather than the British-favored [[Rosario Strait]]. The border established by the Oregon Treaty and finalized by the arbitration in 1872 remains the boundary between the United States and [[Canada]] in the Pacific Northwest.

==Background==
The Oregon Question originated in the 18th century during the early European or American exploration of the [[Pacific Northwest]]. Various Empires began to consider the area suitable for colonial expansion, including the Americans, Russians, Spanish and British. Naval captains such as the Spanish [[Juan José Pérez Hernández]], British [[George Vancouver]] and American [[Robert Gray (sea-captain)|Robert Gray]] gave defining regional water formations like the [[Columbia River]] and the [[Puget Sound]] their modern names and charted in the 1790s. Overland explorations were commenced by the British [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]] in 1792 and later followed by the American [[Lewis and Clark]] expedition, which reached the mouth of the [[Columbia River]] in 1805. These explorers often claimed in the name of their respective governments sovereignty over the Northwest Coast. The knowledge of fur-bearing animal populations like the [[California sea lion]], [[North American beaver]] and the [[Northern fur seal]] were used to create an economic network called the [[maritime fur trade]]. The [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] would remain the main economic interest that drew Euro-Americans to the Pacific Northwest for decades. Merchants exchanged goods for fur pelts along the coast with indigenous nations such as the [[Chinookan people]], the [[Aleut]]s and the [[Nuu-chah-nulth]].

===Spanish colonisation===
A series of [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to the Pacific Northwest]] were financed by the Spanish to strengthen their claims to the region. Creating a colony called [[Santa Cruz de Nuca]] on [[Vancouver Island]], the Spanish were the first European colonisers of the Pacific Northwest outside Russian America to the north. A period of tensions with the United Kingdom, called the [[Nootka Crisis]], arose after the Spanish seized a British vessel. However the three [[Nootka Convention]]s averted conflict, with both countries agreeing to protect their mutual access to [[Friendly Cove]] against outside powers. While the Spanish colony was abandoned, a border delineating the northern reaches of [[New Spain]] wasn't included. Despite the Nootka Conventions still allowing the Spanish to establish colonies in the region, no more attempts were made as other geopolitical and domestic matters drew the attention of the authorities. With the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]] of 1819, the Spanish formally withdrew all formal claims to lands north of the [[42nd parallel north|42° north]].

===Russian interest===
The [[Imperial Russian government]] established the [[Russian-American Company]] in 1799, a monopoly among Russian subjects for fur trading operations in [[Russian America]] with the [[Ukase of 1799]]. In part from the growing Russian activities to the north, the Spanish created the [[Spanish missions in California|Catholic Missions]] to create colonies in [[Alta California]]. Plans for creating Russians colonies in what became the modern American states of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] were formulated by [[Nikolai Rezanov]]. He aimed to relocate the primary colony of Russian America to the entrance of the Columbia River, though was unable to enter the river in 1806 and the plan was abandoned.{{sfn|Langsdorff|1927|p=21}} In 1808 [[Alexander Andreyevich Baranov]] sent the ''[[Russian schooner Nikolai|Nikolai]]'', with the captain "ordered to explore the coast south of Vancouver Island, barter with the natives for sea otter pelts, and if possible discover a site for a permanent Russian post in the Oregon Country."{{sfn|Donnolly|1985|p=4}} The ship wrecked on the [[Olympic Peninsula]] and the surviving  crew didn't return to [[New Archangel]] for two years. The failure of the vessel to find a suitable location led to the Russians to not consider much of the Northwest coast worth colonizing.{{sfn|Donnolly|1985|p=30}} Their interest in the Puget Sound and the Columbia River was diverted to Alta California, with [[Fort Ross]] soon established. The [[Russo-American Treaty of 1824]] and the 1825 [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1825)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]] with the British formally created the southern border of Russian America at parallel 54°40′ north. Specifically, it was agreed, in the 1824 treaty, that no American settlement would be established on the coast or adjacent island north of 54°40′, and no Russian settlement to the south (Russian [[Fort Ross]] was in [[Alta California]], Mexico, and was outside the purview of the treaty). The treaty did not make any explicit statements about sovereignty or territorial claims. The 1825 treaty with Britain was more strongly worded and defined the boundary between Russian and British possessions in North America, which ran north from 54°40′ through what is now the [[Alaska Panhandle]] to the [[141st meridian west]], then along that line north to the Arctic Ocean.

===Early Anglo-American competition===
Neither the Russian nor Spanish empires held significant plans at promoting colonies along the Northwest Coast by the 1810s. The British and the Americans were the remaining two nations with citizens active in commercial operations in the region. Starting with a party of the [[Montreal]] based [[North West Company]] (NWC) employees led by [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] in 1807, the British began land-based operations and opened trading posts throughout the region. Thompson extensively explored the Columbia River watershed. While at the junction of Columbia and [[Snake River|Snake]] Rivers, he erected a pole on July 9, 1811, with a notice stating "Know hereby that this country is claimed by Great Britain as part of its territories ..." and additionally stated the intention of the NWC to build a trading post there.{{sfn|Elliott|1911}} [[Fort Nez Percés]] was later established at the location in 1818. The American [[Pacific Fur Company]] (PFC) began operations in 1811 at [[Fort Astoria]], constructed at the entrance of the Columbia River. The eruption of the [[War of 1812]] didn't lead to a violent confrontation in the Pacific Northwest between the competing companies. Led by [[Donald Mackenzie (explorer)|Donald Mackenzie]], PFC officers agreed to liquidate its assets to their NWC competitors, with an agreement signed on 23 November 1813.{{sfn|Chittenden|1902|pp=222–223}} {{HMS|Racoon|1808|6}} was ordered to capture Fort Astoria, though by the time it arrived, the post was already under NWC management. After the collapse of the PFC, American [[mountain men]] operated in small groups in the region, typically based east of the Rocky Mountains, only to meet once a year at the annual [[Rocky Mountain Rendezvous]].

==Joint occupation==

===Treaty of 1818===
{{Main|Treaty of 1818}}
In 1818, diplomats of the two countries attempted to negotiate a boundary between the rival claims. The Americans suggested dividing the Pacific Northwest along the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]], which was the border between the United States and [[British North America]] east of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The lack of accurate cartographic knowledge led American diplomats to declare the [[Louisiana Purchase]] gave them an incontestable claim to the region.{{sfn|Merk|1950}} British diplomats wanted a border further south along the [[Columbia River]], so as to maintain the [[North West Company]]'s (later the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]'s (HBC)) control of the lucrative [[fur trade]] along that river.{{sfn|Merk|1950}} The diplomatic teams couldn't agree upon mutually satisfactory terms and remained in deadlock by October. [[Albert Gallatin]], the main American negotiator, had previously instructed to have a tentative agreement by the convening of the 3rd session of the [[15th United States Congress]], set for 16 November.

A final proposition was made to the British [[plenipotentiary]], [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Earl of Ripon|Frederick John Robinson]], for the continuation of the 49th parallel west while leaving the United Kingdom, as Gallatin stated, "all the waters emptying in the sound called the Gulf of Georgia."{{sfn|Merk|1950}} This would have awarded "all the territory draining west from the [[Cascade Mountains|Cascade]] divide and north from the Columbia River divide into the gulf" and the entirety of the [[Puget Sound]] along with the Straits of [[Strait of Georgia|Georgia]] and [[Strait of Juan de Fuca|Juan de Fuca]] to the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Merk|1950}} Robinson demurred from the proposal. However, the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, which settled most other disputes from the [[War of 1812]], called for the joint occupation of the region for ten years.

===Proposed partition plans===
As the expiration of the Joint Occupation treaty approached, a second round of negotiations commenced in 1824. American Minister [[Richard Rush]] offered for the extension of agreement with an additional clause on 2 April. The 51° parallel would be a provisional border within the Pacific Northwest, with no British additional settlements to be established south of the line, nor any American settlements north of it.{{sfn|Marshall|1911|p=166}} Despite Rush's offering to modify the temporary border to the 49° parallel, the British negotiators rejected his offer. His proposal was seen as the likely basis for the eventual division of the Pacific Northwest. The British plenipotentiaries [[William Huskisson]] and [[Stratford Canning, 1st Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe|Stratford Canning]] on 29 June pressed instead for a permanent line along the 49° parallel west until the main branch of the Columbia River. With the British formally abandoning claims south or east of the Columbia River, the Oregon Question thence became focused on what later became Western [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and the southern portion of Vancouver Island.{{sfn|Marshall|1911|p=166}} Rush reacted to the British proposal as unfavorably as they had to his own offer, leaving the talks at a stalemate.

[[Image:George Canning by Richard Evans - detail.jpg|150px|thumb|[[George Canning]] has been appraised the most active Secretary of Foreign Affairs in maintaining the British claims of a division along the Columbia River.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=184–188}}]]

Throughout 1825, [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] [[George Canning]] held discussions with [[Sir John Pelly, 1st Baronet|Governor Pelly]] of the HBC as to a potential settlement with the United States. Pelly felt a border along the [[Snake River|Snake]] and Columbia Rivers was advantageous for the United Kingdom and his company.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=184–188}} Contacting American minister [[Rufus King]] in April 1826, Canning requested that a settlement be reached over the Oregon dispute. Gallatin was appointed [[United States Minister to the United Kingdom|Ambassador to the United Kingdom]] and given instructions by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Clay]] in July 1826 to offer a division of the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel to the British.{{sfn|Meany|1914}} In a letter to Prime Minister [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1826, Canning presented the possibilities of trade with the [[Qing Empire]] if a division of the Pacific Northwest was to be made with the Americans. He felt the recognition of American rights to ownership of Astoria, despite its continued use by the NWC and later HBC, was "absolutely unjustifiable."{{sfn|Canning|1887|pp=71–74}} This diplomatic courtesy Canning felt weakened the territorial claims of the United Kingdom. A border along the Columbia River would give "an immense direct intercourse between China and what may be, if we resolve not yield them up, her boundless establishments on the N. W. Coast of America."{{sfn|Canning|1887|pp=71–74}}

===Renewal===
Huskisson was appointed along with [[Henry Unwin Addington]] to negotiate with Gallatin. Unlike his superior, Canning, Huskisson held a negative view of the HBC monopoly and found the region held in dispute with the Americans "of little consequence to the British."{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=184–188}} At the time the HBC's staff were the only continuous white occupants in the region, though their economic activities weren't utilized by Huskinisson in exchanges with Gallatin.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=184–188}} The division suggested by Pelly and Canning's 1824 offer of a Columbia River boundary was rejected. The argument used to counter these offers was the same as in 1824, that a boundary along the Columbia would deny the U.S. an easily accessible deep water port on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The British negotiators to allay this attack offered a detached [[Olympic Peninsula]] as American territory, giving access to both the Straits of Juan de Fuca and Puget Sound.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=184–188}} This was seen as unsatisfactory by the Americans however. The diplomatic talks were continued but failed to divide the region in a satisfactory manner for both nations. The Treaty of 1818 was renewed on 7 August 1827,{{sfn|Shewmaker|1982}} with a clause added by Gallatin that a one-year notice had to be given when either party intended to abrogate the agreement.{{sfn|Meany|1914}} After the death of Canning and the failure to find a satisfactory division of the region with the Americans, "Oregon had been almost forgotten by the [British] politicians ..."{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=184–188}}

==Significance in America==

===Regional activities===
American Protestant missionaries began to arrive in the 1830s and established the [[Methodist Mission]] in the [[Willamette Valley]] and the [[Whitman Mission National Historic Site|Whitman Mission]] east of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]].<ref>[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Pages/facts/history/pre-land.aspx Oregon History: Land-based Fur Trade and Exploration]</ref> [[Ewing Young]] created a [[sawmill|saw mill]]<ref>[http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/oregontrails/ewingyoung.html Ewing Young Route] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210200749/http://www.endoftheoregontrail.org/oregontrails/ewingyoung.html |date=2006-12-10 }}. compiled by Karen Bassett, Jim Renner, and Joyce White.</ref> and a [[gristmill|grist mill]] in the Willamette Valley early in the 1830s.<ref>[http://www.salemhistory.net/people/historic_figures.htm Salem Online History: Salem's Historic Figures]</ref> He and several other American colonists formed the [[Willamette Cattle Company]] in 1837 to bring over 600 head of cattle to the Willamette Valley, with about half of its shares purchased by McLoughlin. Over 700 U.S settlers arrived via the Oregon Trail in the "[[Oregon Trail#Great Migration of 1843|Great Migration of 1843]]". The [[Provisional Government of Oregon]] was established in the Willamette Valley during 1843 as well. Its rule was limited to those interested Americans and former [[French-Canadian]] HBC employees in the valley.

===John Floyd===
The first attempts by the American Government for proactive action in colonising the Pacific Northwest began in 1820 during the 2nd session of the [[16th United States Congress|16th Congress]]. [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]], a [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] from [[Virginia]], spearheaded a report that would "authorize the occupation of the Columbia River, and to regulated trade and intercourse with the Indian tribes thereon."{{sfn|Benton|1854|pp=13–14}} Additionally the bill called for cultivating commercial relations with the [[Qing Empire]] and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. His interest in the distant region likely began after meeting former PFC employee [[Russell Farnham]]. Floyd had the support of fellow Virginian Representative [[Thomas Van Swearingen]] and Representative [[Thomas Metcalfe (Kentucky)|Thomas Metcalfe]] of [[Kentucky]]. The bill was presented to both the House and to [[James Monroe|President Monroe]]. In the House, Floyd's bill was defended by one member who stated that it did not "attempt a colonial settlement. The territory proposed to be occupied is already a part of the United States."{{sfn|Wilson|1900}} Monroe inquired the opinion of [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] for potential revisions. Adams retorted that "The paper was a tissue of errors in fact and abortive reasoning, of invidious reflections and rude invectives. There was nothing could purify it but the fire."{{sfn|Adams|1875|p=238}} Read twice before the legislature, "most of the members not considering it a serious proceeding", it didn't pass.{{sfn|Benton|1854|pp=13–14}}

[[Image:John Floyd (cropped).jpg|150px|thumb|left|Representative [[John Floyd (Virginia politician)|John Floyd]] was the most prominent early Congressional member in favor of extensive American claims in the Pacific Northwest.]]

Floyd continued to authorise legislation calling for an American colony on the Pacific. His career as a Representative ended in 1829, with the Oregon Question not discussed at Congress until 1837. The northern border proposed by Floyd was at first the [[53rd parallel north|53°]], and later 54°40′.{{sfn|Shippee|1918|p=118}} These bills were still met with the apathy or opposition of other Congressional members, one in particular being tabled for consideration by a vote of 100 to 61.{{sfn|Shippee|1918|p=118}} [[Missouri]] Senator [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas H. Benton]] became a vocal supporter of Floyd's efforts, and thought that they would "plant the germ of a powerful and independent Power beyond the Rockies."{{sfn|Shippee|1918|p=118}} [[John C. Calhoun]], then [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]], while somewhat interested in Floyd's considered bills, gave his opinion to that the HBC was an economic threat to American commercial interests in the west.

<blockquote>... so long as the traders of the British Fur Company have free access to the region of the Rocky Mountains from the various posts ... they will in great measure monopolize the Fur Trade West of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], to the almost entire exclusion in the next few years of our trade.{{sfn|Shippee|1918|p=118}}</blockquote>

===1844 presidential election===
The [[1844 United States presidential election|1844 presidential election]] was a definitive turning point for the United States. Admitting the [[Texas Republic]] by diplomatic negotiations to begin a process of [[annexation of Texas]] into the nation was a contentious topic. At the same time, the Oregon Question "became a weapon in a struggle for domestic political power."{{sfn|Graebner|1995|p=35}} At the [[1844 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], the [[party platform]] asserted "That our title to the whole of the Territory of Oregon is clear and unquestionable; that no portion of the same ought to be ceded to England or any other power, and that the reoccupation of Oregon and the re-annexation of Texas at the earliest practicable period are great American measures ..."<ref>{{cite web|title=Democratic Party Platform of 1844|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=29573|website=The American Presidency Project|access-date=16 February 2015}}</ref> By tying the Oregon dispute to the more controversial Texas debate, the Democrats appealed to expansionist members from both the Northern and Southern states.{{sfn|Graebner|1995|p=35}} Enlargement in the Pacific Northwest offered a means of mollifying Northern fears of allowing Texas, another [[Slave and free states|slave state]], by a counterbalance of additional free states. Democratic candidate [[James K. Polk]] went on to win a narrow victory over [[United States Whig Party|Whig]] candidate [[Henry Clay]], in part because Clay had taken a stand against immediate expansion in Texas. Despite the use of the Oregon Question in the election, according to Edward Miles, the topic wasn't "a significant campaign issue" as "the Whigs would have been forced to discuss it."{{sfn|Miles|1957}}

===="Fifty-four Forty or Fight!"====
A popular slogan later associated with Polk and his campaign of 1844, "[[Parallel 54°40′ north|Fifty-four Forty or Fight!]]" was not actually coined during the election but appeared only by January 1846 and was promoted and driven in part by the press associated with the Democratic Party. The phrase has since become frequently misidentified as a Polk campaign slogan, even in many textbooks.{{sfn|Miles|1957}}{{sfn|Rosenboom|1973|p=123}}{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|p=223}}{{sfn|Sperber|1970|pp=5–11}} ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'' attributes the slogan to William Allen. 54°40′ was the southern boundary of [[Russian America]] and considered the northernmost limit of the Pacific Northwest. One actual Democratic campaign slogan from the election (used in [[Pennsylvania]]) was the more mundane "Polk, [[George M. Dallas|Dallas]], and the [[Tariff of 1842|Tariff of '42]]."{{sfn|Rosenboom|1973|p=123}}

The southernmost border of [[Alaska]] remains 54°40′ since the purchase from Russia on October 18, 1867, with [[British Columbia]], established as the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–1866)|Colony of British Columbia]] on August 2, 1858.

==British interest==

===Hudson's Bay Company===
{{Main|Columbia Department}}
[[File:Sir George Simpson Resized.jpg|150px|thumb|right|[[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]], manager of HBC operations in North America, reported in 1837 that the Pacific Northwest "may become an object of very great importance, and we are strengthening that claim to it ... by forming the nucleus of a colony through the establishment of farms, and the settlement of some of our retiring officers and servants as agriculturalists."{{sfn|Merk|1968|p=339}}]]
The [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) merged with the North West Company in 1821 and assumed its various fur trading stations. The HBC held a license among British subjects to trade with the populous aboriginal peoples of the region, and its network of trading posts and routes extended southward from [[New Caledonia (Canada)|New Caledonia]], another HBC fur-trade district, into the Columbia basin (most of New Caledonia lay south of 54–40). The HBC's headquarters for the entire region became established at [[Fort Vancouver]] (modern [[Vancouver, Washington]]) in 1824. During that year [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] while discussing the company's "uncertain tenure of the Columbia" with [[Andrew Colville|Governor Colville]], discussed the possibility of closing operations along the river.{{sfn|Merk|1968|p=339}} "If the Americans settle on the mouth of the Columbia it would in my opinion be necessary to abandon the Coast [south of the river] ..." Simpson stated, with the company posts to "move to the Northward ..."{{sfn|Merk|1932|pp=653–677}} At its pinnacle in the late 1830s and early 1840s, Fort Vancouver watched over 34 outposts, 24 ports, six ships, and 600 employees.

===Domestic===
The ''[[Edinburgh Review#Edinburgh Review, 1802–1929|Edinburgh Review]]'' declared the Pacific Northwest "the last corner of the earth left free for the occupation of a civilized race. When Oregon shall be colonised, the map of the world may be considered as filled up."{{sfn|Edinburgh Review|p=185}}

===Naval presence===
[[Royal Navy]] ships were dispatched to the Pacific Northwest throughout the decades, to both expand cartographical knowledge and protect fur trading stations. The British established the [[Pacific Station]] in 1826 at [[Valparaíso]], [[Chile]], increasing the strategic capabilities of their navy. A squadron was moved there and later vessels sent to the Pacific Northwest were based out of the port. [[HMS Blossom (1806)|HMS ''Blossom'']] was in the region during 1818. The next surveying expedition was commenced by [[HMS Sulphur (1826)|HMS ''Sulphur'']] and [[HMS Starling (1829)|HMS ''Starling'']] in 1837, with operations lasting until 1839. Dispatched from the Pacific Station to gather intelligence on the HBC posts, [[HMS Modeste (1837)|HMS ''Modeste'']] arrived at the Columbia River in July 1844. Chief Factor [[James Douglas (governor)|James Douglas]] complained that the naval officers "had more taste for a [[lark]] than a 'musty' lecture on politics or the greater national interests in question."{{sfn|McLoughlin|p=180}} The ''Modeste'' visited the HBC trading posts of Forts George, Vancouver, Victoria and [[Fort Simpson (Columbia Department)|Simpson]].{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945a}}

==Political efforts during Tyler presidency==
Missouri Senator [[Lewis F. Linn|Lewis Linn]] tabled legislation in 1842, inspired in part by Floyd's previous efforts. Linn's bill called for the government to create land grants for men interested in settling the Pacific Northwest. The arrival of [[Alexander Baring, 1st Baron Ashburton|Baron Ashburton]] in April 1842, sent to resolve several territorial disputes with the United States, delayed Linn's legislation. Initially focusing on the Pacific Northwest, Ashburton presented [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Daniel Webster]] the 1824 partition proposal made by Canning of a division along the Columbia River.{{sfn|Shewmaker|1982}} Webster rejected the offer for the same reasons it was previously repudiated; the division would leave the United States with no suitable locations for a large Pacific port. Webster suggested that Ashburton's proposal may have been found acceptable by the Americans, if the United States could be compensated with the [[Mexico|Mexican]] owned [[San Francisco Bay]].{{sfn|Shewmaker|1982}} Ashburton passed on the offer to his superiors, but no further action was taken. Both diplomats became focused on settling the [[Aroostook War]] and formulated the [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]].

At the final session of the [[27th United States Congress|27th Congress]] on 19 December 1842, Linn presented a similar bill to colonize the Pacific Northwest as he put it, "by the Anglo-American race, which will extend our limits from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean."{{sfn|Wilson|1900}} Arguments over the bill lasted over a month, and it was eventually passed in the Senate 24–22.{{sfn|Wilson|1900}} In opposition to Linn's bill, Calhoun famously declared that the U.S. government should pursue a policy of "wise and masterly inactivity"<ref>The phrase "wise and masterly inactivity", which Calhoun used more than once, originated with Sir [[James Mackintosh]]. ([http://www.bartleby.com/73/1038.html source])</ref> in Oregon, letting settlement determine the eventual boundary.{{sfn|Wilson|1900}} Many of Calhoun's fellow [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], however, soon began to advocate a more direct approach.{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|pp=109–110}}

By early 1843, Webster returned to the Oregon Question, formalising a plan that included the 1826 British offer of the Olympic Peninsula enclave and the purchase of [[Alta California]] from Mexico.{{sfn|Shewmaker|1982}} The increasing hostility President Tyler had with the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] led to Webster's disinterest in continuing to act as the Secretary of State and his plan was shelved. The American minister to the UK, [[Edward Everett]], was given authority to negotiate with British officials to settle the Oregon Question in October 1843. Meeting with Prime Minister [[Robert Peel]]'s [[Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs|Foreign Secretary]], [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Earl of Aberdeen]] on 29 November, Everett presented the terms considered by President [[John Tyler]]. The old offer of the 49th parallel was once more presented, along with a guarantee to free access to the Columbia River.{{sfn|Government Printing Office|1872|pp=6–11}} However during President Tyler's [[State of the Union]] address that year on 6 December, he claimed "the entire region of country lying on the Pacific and embraced within 42° and 54°40′ of north latitude."<ref>[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=29647 ''1843 State of the Union Address''.] Accessed 6 November 2014.</ref> After receiving this declaration, Aberdeen began to consult with the committee and Governor Pelly, previously left out of the most recent diplomatic exchanges.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|p=231}}

==Polk presidency==
[[File:JamesKnoxPolk.png|180px|thumb|President James K. Polk was elected in 1844 in part from his support for substantial claims against the British. Much of this rhetoric was to make the United Kingdom accept the long tabled proposed division along the 49th parallel.]]

In his March 1845 [[Inauguration Day|inaugural address]], President Polk quoted from the party platform, saying that the U.S. title to Oregon was "clear and unquestionable".{{sfn|Polk|2014}} Tensions grew, with both sides moving to strengthen border fortifications in anticipation of war. Despite Polk's bold language, he was actually prepared to compromise, and had no real desire to go to war over Oregon. He believed that a firm stance would compel the British to accept a resolution agreeable to the United States. While meeting with Representative [[James A. Black]] on 4 January 1846, Polk stated that "the only way to treat [[John Bull]] was to look him straight in the eye ... if Congress faultered {{sic}} ... John Bull would immediately become arrogant and more grasping in his demands ..."{{sfn|Polk|1910|pp=153–155}} But Polk's position on Oregon was not mere posturing: he genuinely believed that the U.S. had a legitimate claim to the entire region.{{sfn|Haynes|1997|pp=118–120}} He rejected British offers to settle the dispute through arbitration, fearing that no impartial third party could be found.{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|p=322}}

Many newspaper editors in the United States clamored for Polk to claim the entire region as the Democrats had proposed in the 1844 campaign. Headlines like "The Whole of Oregon or None" by ''[[The Union (newspaper)|The Union]]'' editor [[Thomas Ritchie (journalist)|Thomas Ritchie]] appeared on 6 November 1845.{{sfn|Miles|1957}} In a column in the ''New York Morning News'' on December 27, 1845, editor [[John L. O'Sullivan]] argued that the United States should claim all of Oregon "by the right of our manifest destiny to overspread and to possess the whole of the continent which Providence has given us ..."{{sfn|Horsman|1981}} Soon afterwards, the term "[[Manifest Destiny]]" became a standard phrase for expansionists, and a permanent part of the American lexicon. O'Sullivan's version of "Manifest Destiny" was not a call for war, but such calls were soon forthcoming.

After Polk's inauguration, British diplomats began to receive instructions influenced from HBC officials like Simpson, whose suggestions were transmitted through Pelly and then Aberdeen to the [[British Ambassador to the United States|British Ambassador]] [[Richard Pakenham]]. In a letter written to Calhoun in August 1844, Pakenham pressed for a border along the Columbia River. He made an offer that likely originated from Simpson: Americans could select naval bases on the portion of Vancouver Island south of the 49th parallel or along the Strait of Juan de Fuca in return.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|p=231}} Diplomatic channels continued negotiations throughout 1844; by early 1845 Everett reported the willingness of Aberdeen to accept the 49th parallel, provided the southern portion of [[Vancouver Island]] would become British territory.{{sfn|Government Printing Office|1872|pp=6–11}}

In the summer of 1845, the Polk administration renewed the proposal to divide Oregon along the 49th parallel to the Pacific Ocean. U.S. Secretary of State [[James Buchanan]] on 12 July{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|p=240}} offered the British any desired ports on the portion of Vancouver Island south of this line,{{sfn|Wilson|1900}} though navigation rights of the Columbia River weren't included. Because this proposal fell short of the Tyler administration's earlier offer, Pakenham rejected the offer without first contacting London.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|p=240}} Offended, Polk officially withdrew the proposal on August 30, 1845, and broke off negotiations. Aberdeen censured Pakenham for this diplomatic blunder, and attempted to renew the dialogue. By then, however, Polk was suspicious of British intentions, and under increasing political pressure not to compromise. He declined to reopen negotiations.{{sfn|Haynes|1997|p=322}}{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|pp=237–249, 296–300}}

===Congressional pressure===
[[Image:Lewis Cass - Brady-Handy.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Senator [[Lewis Cass]] was a leading advocate of 54°40′, but backed away from the claim when it became untenable. Like [[James Buchanan]], Cass had presidential ambitions and did not want to alienate Americans on either side of the Oregon Question.]]

In his [[State of the Union Address|annual address]] to Congress on December 2, 1845, Polk recommended giving the British the required one-year notice of the termination of the joint occupation agreement. Democratic expansionists in Congress from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], led by Senators [[Lewis Cass]] of [[Michigan]], [[Edward A. Hannegan]] of [[Indiana]], and [[William Allen (governor)|William Allen]] of [[Ohio]], called for war with the United Kingdom rather than accepting anything short of all of Oregon up to [[Parallel 54°40′ north]]. These pronouncements were fueled by a number of factors, including traditional [[Anglophobia|distrust of the British]] and a belief that the U.S. had the better claim and would make better use of the land.

The debate was not strictly divided along party or sectional lines, with many who clamored for the 54°40′ border were Northerners upset at Polk's willingness to compromise on the Pacific Northwest border. Polk's uncompromising pursuit of Texas, an acquisition seen favorable for Southern slave owners, angered many advocates of 54°40′, as the President was a Southerner and a slave owner. As historian [[David M. Pletcher]] noted, "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight" seemed to be directed at the southern aristocracy in the U.S. as much as at the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|pp=335–337}}

Moderates like Webster warned that the U.S. could not win a war against the [[British Empire]], and that negotiation could still achieve U.S. territorial goals. Webster confided to [[Evelyn Denison, 1st Viscount Ossington|Viscount Ossington]], a personal friend, on 26 February 1846, that it would be a "stupendous folly and enormous crime" for the two nations to declare war over the Pacific Northwest.{{sfn|Wiltse|1973}}

===British reaction===
[[Image:Georgehamiltongordonaberdeen.jpg|180px|thumb|Foreign Secretary [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]] was committed to maintaining peaceable relations with the Americans, evaluating the disputed territory in the Oregon Question as unimportant.]]

====Pacific naval forces====
During the height of tensions with the United States in 1845 and 1846, there were at least five Royal Navy vessels operating in the Pacific Northwest.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}} The 80-gun ship-of-the-line [[HMS Collingwood (1841)|HMS ''Collingwood'']] was deployed to Valparaíso under the commander in chief, Rear Admiral Sir [[George Francis Seymour|George Seymour]], in 1845, with orders to report on the situation in the region.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945a}} [[HMS America (1810)|HMS ''America'']], under the command of Captain John Gordon (younger brother Foreign Secretary Aberdeen), was therefore sent north that year.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945a}} [[Roderick Finlayson]] gave a tour of Vancouver Island to the visiting naval officers, where Gordon aired his negative appraisal of the Northwest region. During a deer hunt on the island, Gordon informed Finlayson that he "would not give one of the barren hills of Scotland for all he saw around him."{{sfn|Finlayson|1891|p=15}} ''America'' departed from the Strait of Juan de Fuca on 1 October. ''Modeste'' entered the Columbia River and arrived at Fort Vancouver on 30 November 1845,{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945a}} where it remained until 4 May 1847.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}} ''Modeste'' was not favorably viewed by American colonists in the Willamette Valley, threatened by the large warship. Relations were improved when the officers organised a [[Ball (dance)|ball]] at Vancouver on 3 February 1846,<ref>The [[Oregon Spectator]] (Oregon City, OR), [http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn84022662/1846-02-19/ed-1/seq-2/ ''Ball at Vancouver.''] 19 February 1846, p. 2.</ref> later theatrical performances by the ship's crew, including ''[[Love in a Village]]'' and ''[[The Mock Doctor]]'', along with [[picnic]]s.<ref>[[Oregon Spectator]] (Oregon City, OR), [http://www.oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn84022662/1846-05-14/ed-1/seq-2/ ''Theatre at Vancouver.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151124034707/http://oregonnews.uoregon.edu/lccn/sn84022662/1846-05-14/ed-1/seq-2/ |date=2015-11-24 }} 14 May 1846, p. 2.</ref>

[[HMS Fisgard (1819)|HMS ''Fisgard'']] was the first reinforcement, ordered from the Pacific Station by Rear Admiral Seymour in January 1846. Captain Duntze was to "afford Protection to Her Majesty's Subjects in Oregon and the North West Coast ..." and avoid any potential confrontations with American settlers.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}} On 5 May ''Fisgard'' reached Fort Victoria, later moving to [[Fort Nisqually]] on the 18th, where it remained until October. Sent to aid other British vessels navigate difficult channels and rivers, [[HMS Cormorant (1842)|HMS ''Cormorant'']], a [[Paddle steamer]], arrived at the Strait of Juan de Fuca in June.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}} Two survey ships were dispatched from [[Plymouth]] in June 1845, [[HMS Herald (1824)|HMS ''Herald'']] and [[HMS Pandora (1833)|HMS ''Pandora'']], for charting the coast of the Americas.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}} The vessels reached [[Cape Flattery]] on 24 June 1846. ''Cormorant'' towed ''Herald'' to Fort Victoria three days later.{{sfn|Seemann|1853|p=100}} ''Herald'' and ''Pandora'' spent several months charting Puget Sound and Vancouver Island until 2 September, when the vessels sailed for Alta California.{{sfn|Seemann|1853|p=112}} ''Fisgard'' and ''Cormorant'' both departed for Valparaíso in October.{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}} As ''Modeste'' was the only British ship in the region during 1847, the Oregon Treaty "seemed to have taken the edge off of the Royal Navy's interest in the Northwest Coast."{{sfn|Longstaff|Lamb|1945b}}

====War plan====
Due to his extensive travels throughout the western stations of the HBC, Governor Pelly instructed [[George Simpson (administrator)|George Simpson]] to draft a plan for the British Government if hostilities were to arise with the Americans.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=236–237}} Finalizing the proposal on 29 March 1845, Simpson called for two areas to launch offensives. The [[Red River Colony]] would be the base of operations for forays into the [[Great Plains]], an expansive region then only lightly colonized by Americans.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=236–237}} A militia composed of [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] riflemen and neighboring [[First Nations]] like the [[Ojibwe]] would be created, along with a garrison of [[British Army|Regular Army]] infantry. To secure the Pacific Northwest and the Columbia River, Simpson felt [[Cape Disappointment (Washington)|Cape Disappointment]] was of critical importance. A naval force of two [[steamboat]]s and two [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] would bring a detachment of [[Royal Marines]] to create a [[coastal battery]] there.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=236–237}} Recruitment was hoped by Simpson to gain a force led by Regular Army officers of 2,000 Métis and [[Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest|indigenous peoples]] in the region. His proposal quickly earned the interest of the British Government as he met with Prime Minister Peel and Foreign Secretary Aberdeen on 2 April. [[British pound|£]]1,000 were awarded to lay the ground work for defensive operations in the Pacific Northwest.{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|pp=236–237}} [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] [[Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby|Lord Stanley]] favored the plan, declaring that the HBC had to finance military operations west of [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]].{{sfn|Galbraith|1957|p=240}}

==Resolution==
Aberdeen had no intention of going to war over a region that was of diminishing economic value to the United Kingdom. Furthermore the United States was an important trading partner, especially with the need of American wheat in the onset of [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine in Ireland]]. Aberdeen and Pakenham were negotiating from a position of strength. The key was the overwhelming naval power which Britain could have brought to bear against the United States, combined with a diplomatic and political landscape that ultimately favored the British government's aim of protecting her interests robustly but without resort to armed conflict. Ultimately British politicians and naval officers recognized that any conflict over the Oregon boundary, however undesirable, would be decided, like the War of 1812, on the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. and the Great Lakes. The Royal Navy's presence on the Atlantic seaboard wasn't as numerically prominent as the American forces, yet its overall superiority to the U.S. Navy was decisive upon American decision-making during the crisis, especially their decision to compromise.{{sfn|Gough|1971|pp=70–83}} [[Louis McLane]], the American minister in the United Kingdom, reported to Buchanan on 2 February that the British were prepared "to commission immediately some thirty ships-of-the-line in addition to steamers and other vessels held in reserve ..."{{sfn|Hunter|1937|p=58}} Polk's bluff had been called.

American diplomat [[Edward Everett]] contacted the [[Whigs (British political party)|Whig]] leader [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|John Russell]] on 28 December 1845, supporting a revision of the American offer so as to allow the British to keep the entirety of Vancouver Island. He warned Russell that influence among the Whigs could stifle the negotiations. "If you choose to rally the public opinion of England against this basis of compromise, it will not be easy for Sir. R. Peel and Lord Aberdeen to agree to it."{{sfn|Merk|1932|pp=653–677}} While still considering the Columbia River important for British interests, Russell assured Aberdeen of his support in settling the Oregon Question. While Everett's was influential in this political move, Russell felt it was, as Frederick Merk stated, "prudent Whig policy" to support Aberdeen in this case.{{sfn|Merk|1968|p=339}}

Although Polk had called on Congress in December 1845 to pass a resolution notifying the British of the termination of joint occupancy agreement, it was not until April 23, 1846. that both houses complied. The passage was delayed especially in the Senate by contentious debate. Several Southern Senators, like [[William S. Archer]]<ref>Cong. Globe, 28th Cong., 1st Sess. 520 (1846)</ref> and [[John M. Berrien]],<ref>Cong. Globe, 28th Cong., 1st Sess. 511 (1846)</ref> were wary of military capabilities of the British Empire. Ultimately a mild resolution was approved, the text of which called on both governments to settle the matter amicably.

By a large margin, moderation had won out over calls for war. Unlike Western Democrats, most Congressmen—like Polk—did not want to fight for 54°&nbsp;40′.&nbsp;{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|p=351}} The Polk administration then made it known that the British government should offer terms to settle the dispute. Despite the cooling diplomatic relations, a repeat of the War of 1812 was not popular with either nation's government. Time was of the essence, because it was well known that the [[Robert Peel|Peel government]] would fall with the impending repeal of the [[Corn Laws]] in the United Kingdom, and then negotiations would have to begin again with a new ministry. At a time when the European continental balance was a far more pressing problem, a costly war with a major trading partner was not popular with the British government. Aberdeen and McLane quickly worked out a compromise and sent it to the United States.

==Oregon Treaty==
{{Main|Oregon Treaty}}
[[Image:Wpdms oregon territory 1848.png|frame|The [[Oregon Territory]], as established after the [[Oregon Treaty]], superimposed over the current state boundaries.]]
Pakenham and Buchanan drew up a formal treaty, known as the Oregon Treaty, which was ratified by the Senate on June 18, 1846, by a vote of 41–14. The mainland border was set at the 49th parallel, the original U.S. proposal, with navigation rights on the Columbia River granted to British subjects living in the area. Senator William Allen, one of the most outspoken advocates of the 54°&nbsp;40′ claim, felt betrayed by Polk and resigned his chairmanship of the [[U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Foreign Relations Committee]].  The signing of the treaty ended the joint occupation with the United Kingdom, making most Oregonians south of the 49th parallel U.S. citizens.{{sfn|Walker|1999|p=60}}

Henry Commager appraised the factors leading to the settlement as "a combination of temporary, fortuitous, and circumstantial phenomena, extraneous to the local situation, largely outside of American control, and foreign to American influence."{{sfn|Commager|1927}} Canadian Hugh LL. Keenlyside and American Gerald S. Brown wrote a century after the treaty that

{{Quote|under the existing conditions, [it] was just and equitable. ''Neither nation had a clear legal title to any of the territory'', and the result was practically an equal division. Great Britain was given the better harbors, and greater resources in minerals, timber, and fish; the United States received much more agricultural land, and a district that has, on the whole, a better climate. This decision, moreover, is almost unique among the solutions of American boundary troubles, in that it has been accepted with reasonable satisfaction by both nations. A better proof of its justice could hardly be demanded.{{sfn|Knopf|1952|p=171}}}}

The terms of the Oregon Treaty were essentially the same ones that had been offered earlier by the Tyler administration, and thus represented a diplomatic victory for Polk.{{sfn|Haynes|1997|p=136}} However, Polk has often been criticized for his handling of the Oregon Question. Historian Sam W. Haynes characterizes Polk's policy as "[[brinkmanship]]" which "brought the United States perilously close to a needless and potentially disastrous conflict".{{sfn|Haynes|1997|p=194}} David M. Pletcher notes that while Polk's bellicose stance was the by-product of internal American politics, the war crisis was "largely of his own creation" and might have been avoided "with more sophisticated diplomacy".{{sfn|Pletcher|1973|p=592}} According to Jesse Reeves, "Had [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston]] been in Aberdeen's position at the time of Polk's 'firm' pronouncement, Polk might have lost Oregon."{{sfn|Reeves|1907|p=263}} Aberdeen's desire for peace and good relations with the United States "are responsible for the settlement that Polk thought to gain by a firm policy. That Aberdeen was "bluffed" by Polk is absurd."{{sfn|Reeves|1907|p=263}}

The treaty set the mainland boundary at the 49th parallel and retained Vancouver Island as British territory, but it was ambiguously phrased about the route of the boundary through the water. The treaty provided that the marine boundary would follow "the deepest channel" out to the Strait of Juan de Fuca, which left the fate of the [[San Juan Islands]] in question. After the "[[Pig War (1859)|Pig War]]", arbitration by [[William I of Germany|Kaiser William I]] of the [[German Empire]] led to the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]], which awarded the United States all the islands.

[[Upper Canada]] politicians and public, already angry with the Oregon Treaty, were once again upset that Britain had not looked after their interests and sought greater autonomy in international affairs.
