'''Indecent Obsession''' (also seen as '''Obsession''') were an Australian [[pop rock]] band formed early in 1987 in [[Brisbane]] with founding mainstays Daryl Sims on drums and Michael Szumowski on keyboards. By 1988 the line-up also included Andrew Coyne on lead guitar and David Dixon on lead vocals. They released three studio albums, ''[[Spoken Words (album)|Spoken Words]]'' (November 1989) and ''[[Indio (album)|Indio]]'' (August 1992), both reached the top&nbsp;50 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA Albums Chart]]. In 1990 ''[[Spoken Words (album)|Spoken Words]]'' was repackaged for United States market as ''Indecent Obsession'', which reached the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In May 1989 they issued their debut single, "[[Say Goodbye (Indecent Obsession song)|Say Goodbye]]", which peaked at No.&nbsp;6 on the ARIA Singles Chart – their highest position in Australia. Their second single, "[[Tell Me Something (song)|Tell Me Something]]" (September), reached No.&nbsp;17 nationally. When issued in the US it peaked at No.&nbsp;31 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. It reached No.&nbsp;1 in [[Indonesia]] and [[Hong Kong]], and Top&nbsp;10 in [[Japan]] and [[South Africa]]. For the Asian market the band used the shortened name, Obsession. In 1992 they were the first Western act to tour South Africa after the lifting of the [[Apartheid in South Africa#Cultural and sporting isolation|cultural isolation]] during the apartheid era. They were "greeted by screaming fans and scenes of mass hysteria", both their second album, ''[[Indio (album)|Indio]]'', and one of its singles, "[[Kiss Me (Indecent Obsession song)|Kiss Me]]", peaked at No.&nbsp;1 on the relevant South African charts. By 1993 Sims and Szumowski were joined by Mark Gray on bass guitar, Richard Hennassey on lead vocals and Graham Kearns on lead guitar.
