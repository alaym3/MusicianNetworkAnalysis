That year, Mars released his debut [[studio album]] ''[[Doo-Wops & Hooligans]]'', which blended pop with reggae pop and R&B. It spawned the international number-one singles "[[Just the Way You Are (Bruno Mars song)|Just the Way You Are]]", "[[Grenade (song)|Grenade]]", and "[[The Lazy Song]]". Drawing inspiration from disco, funk, rock, reggae and soul genres, his second studio album, ''[[Unorthodox Jukebox]]'' (2012), was his first number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It amassed two [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number-one hits, "[[Locked Out of Heaven]]" and "[[When I Was Your Man]]".

In 2014, Mars was featured on [[Mark Ronson]]'s "[[Uptown Funk]]", which topped various music charts, spending a total of fourteen and seven weeks atop the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and the [[UK Singles Chart]], respectively. Mars's third studio album, the R&B-focused, ''[[24K Magic (album)|24K Magic]]'' (2016), received seven Grammy Awards, winning the major categories of [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]], Record of the Year, and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]]. The album also yielded the top-five singles "[[24K Magic (song)|24K Magic]]", "[[That's What I Like (Bruno Mars song)|That's What I Like]]", his seventh ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single, and a remix of "[[Finesse (song)|Finesse]]" featuring [[Cardi B]]. In 2021, Mars and [[Anderson .Paak]], as [[Silk Sonic]], released the collaborative studio album, ''[[An Evening with Silk Sonic]]'', whose single "[[Leave the Door Open (song)|Leave the Door Open]]" topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100.

Mars has sold over 130&nbsp;million records worldwide, making him one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]].

In 1992, he appeared in a cameo role in the film ''[[Honeymoon in Vegas]]'' and was interviewed by [[Pauly Shore]] on MTV. When Mars was six years old, he was featured on ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and throughout grade school, he performed with his family's band, two shows a night, covering [[Frankie Lymon]] and [[Little Anthony]]. When he was a child he had a small version of a drum set, guitar, piano, and some percussion and learned to play the instruments. When Mars was 12, his parents divorced, ending The Love Notes act. His father's various businesses, ranging from temporary-tattoo parlors to memorabilia shops, failed. Consequently, there was no longer a steady source of income. He moved out of his parents' house along with his brother and father.

Shortly after moving to Los Angeles, Mars signed a record contract with [[Motown|Motown Records]] in 2004, but the deal "went nowhere", leading him to have a conversation with [[will.i.am]]'s management, which also turned out to be fruitless.<ref name="Orbit">{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-01-25-brunomars25_ST_N.htm|title=Bruno Mars' musical orbit seems inescapable|last=Jones|first=Steve|work=USA Today|date=January 25, 2011|access-date=February 3, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110201064858/http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2011-01-25-brunomars25_ST_N.htm|archive-date=February 1, 2011}}</ref><ref name="GQ interview">{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201304/bruno-mars-interview-gq-april-2013|pages=2–3|title=The Mars Expedition|last=Heath|first=Christ|work=[[GQ]]|date=March 19, 2013|issue=April 2013|access-date=March 14, 2015}}</ref> However, the singer's experience with Motown proved to be beneficial to his career.

When Lawrence was first told he should meet Mars he was reluctant to do so since he did not even have money for bus fare.

In 2008, on the verge of giving up, they received a call from Brandon Creed, who was looking for songs for a reunited [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]]. He liked their song "Lost", which was written for Mars.

Mars claims that his work with other artists has influenced his musical style: "''Nothin' on You'' had a Motown vibe, ''Billionaire'' was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favorites is the [[CeeLo Green]] song.

Due to the [[Ticket resale|ticket reselling]] that occurred during the week after the performance of Mars at the Super Bowl, and in order to limit that kind of profiteering, [[Hawaii Senate]] President [[Donna Mercado Kim]] introduced Senate Resolution 12, also known as the ''Bruno Mars Act''. It limits all ticket purchases within 48 hours of the on-sale date to the physical box office. This ensures that anyone who comes to the box office to buy tickets for a show should almost certainly be guaranteed a ticket and discourages ticket scalping.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/02/12/could-the-bruno-mars-act-change-the-way-tickets-are-bought-for-high-demand-concerts/|title=Could "The Bruno Mars Act" Change The Way Tickets Are Bought For High Demand Concerts?|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|work=Forbes|date=February 12, 2014|access-date=February 27, 2014}}</ref> The State Senate in Hawaii passed the law.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jesselawrence/2014/04/03/sparse-primary-market-helps-drive-up-price-of-bruno-mars-tickets-on-secondary-market/|title=Sparse Primary Market Helps Drive Up Price of Bruno Mars Tickets on Secondary Market|last=Lawrence|first=Jesse|work=Forbes|date=April 4, 2014|access-date=April 26, 2014}}</ref> However, the bill died at the conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/38409717/how-did-so-many-get-shut-out-of-bruno-mars-tickets-blame-it-on-the-bots/|title=How did so many get shut out of Bruno Mars tickets?

==Personal life==

===Family and relationships===
Eric Hernandez, Mars's brother, has continuously served as the drummer for his backup band, The Hooligans. Their sisters, Tiara, Tahiti, and Presley, as well as their cousin Jamie, make up the all-girl music group The Lylas. When she was young, Jamie moved in with the siblings due to parental issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1705558/bruno-mars-sisters-lylas-wetv/|title=Bruno Mars' Sisters Taking Their Turn on the Spotlight Band on 'The Lylas' And Of Course They're Getting A Reality Show|last=Roland|first=Driadonna|work=MTV|date=April 12, 2013|access-date=December 30, 2016}}</ref> Mars began dating model [[Jessica Caban]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latina.com/buzz/bruno-mars-girlfriend-jessica-caban-bio-facts#6|title=8 things to know about Bruno Mars' girlfriend|last=Rodriguez|first=Priscilla|work=[[Latina (magazine)|Latina]]|date=January 9, 2018|access-date=March 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201184924/http://www.latina.com/buzz/bruno-mars-girlfriend-jessica-caban-bio-facts|archive-date=February 1, 2014}}</ref> The two remain a couple {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, residing together in a mansion in the Hollywood Hills with a [[Rottweiler]] named Geronimo.<ref name="RSJE"/>

Mars returned from an overseas gig in May 2013 when he learned in the Los Angeles airport that his mother was gravely ill. He immediately got on a plane to Hawaii. His mother died the next day.<ref name="RSJE">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/life-on-planet-mars-w447916|title=Bruno Mars: The Private Anxiety of a Pop Perfectionist|last=Eells|first=Josh|work=Rolling Stone|date=November 2, 2016|access-date=November 2, 2016|url-access=limited}}</ref> On June 2, 2013, a publicist for Atlantic Records confirmed to the Associated Press that Mars's mother had suffered a [[brain aneurysm]].

===Race===
In 2013, Mars told ''Rolling Stone'' that record executives "had trouble categorizing him", and were consequently unsure which radio stations would play his songs, or to which ethnic group (black or white) he would appeal.<ref name="RSBH"/> In the same month, he confessed that "Nothin' on You" was rejected by a "music industry decision-maker" because of his race. That experience made him feel like a "mutant", and he says that was his lowest point. "Even with that song in my back pocket to seal the deal, things like that are coming out of people's mouths. It made me feel like I wasn't even in the room."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2013/05/17/bruno-mars-red-hot/2/|title=Bruno Mars is red hot|last=Greenblatt|first=Leah|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=May 17, 2013|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref> In 2018, Mars was accused during ''The Grapevine'', a series that explores African-American issues, of cultural appropriation on social media for using his racial ambiguity to profit from black music, and was criticized for mimicking the sound of past artists.
