'''Fredrick Jamel Tipton''' (born June 14, 1982), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Freddie Gibbs''', is an American rapper from [[Gary, Indiana]]. After initially being signed to [[Interscope Records]] in 2006, Gibbs recorded his debut studio album under the label. However, he was eventually dropped and the album was cancelled.
