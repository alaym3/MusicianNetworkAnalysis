In their 2017 [[YouTube]] documentary ''Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated'', Lovato revealed that their treatment at Timberline Knolls had not been entirely successful, stating that they still struggled with alcoholism and a [[cocaine addiction]] in the year following their stint in the treatment center and further admitting that they were in fact under the influence of cocaine while being interviewed about their sobriety for ''Demi Lovato: Stay Strong''.<ref name="Simply Complicated">{{cite web|title=Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated – Official Documentary|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWTlL_w8cRA|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=October 21, 2017}}</ref><ref name="SC Billboard" /><ref name="SC Maxim" /><ref name="SC InStyle" /> They stated, "I wasn't working my program.

Lovato also stated that their drug and alcohol addiction caused them to not only nearly [[Drug overdose|overdose]] several times, but later began to impact their ability to perform live and promote their ''Unbroken'' album, referencing a 2012 performance on ''[[American Idol]]'' where they were severely [[Hangover|hungover]].<ref name="Simply Complicated" /><ref name="SC Maxim">{{cite news|title=Demi Lovato Talks About Casual Sex and Cocaine Addiction in Her Revealing 'Simply Complicated'|url=https://www.maxim.com/women/demi-lovato-talks-cocaine-casual-sex-simply-complicated-2017-10|access-date=October 22, 2017|magazine=[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]|date=October 22, 2017}}</ref><ref name="SC InStyle">{{cite news|last1=Fowler|first1=Brandi|title=Demi Lovato's Childhood Bullies Were So Intense They Petitioned for Her Suicide|url=http://www.instyle.com/news/demi-lovato-simply-complicated-documentary-interview|magazine=[[InStyle]]|date=October 17, 2017|access-date=October 22, 2017}}</ref> After their management team had expressed their intentions to leave them, Lovato agreed to resume treatment and counseling for their addiction, leading to their move to a sober-living facility in Los Angeles with roommates and responsibilities to help them overcome their drug and alcohol problems.<ref name="Simply Complicated" /><ref name="SC InStyle" /> In 2021, though stating they were done with hard drugs, such as heroin, Lovato revealed they were not completely sober as they drank and smoked [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in moderation, something many of their friends openly disagreed with. They decided on moderation as they felt they were setting themself up for failure if they told themself they were never going to drink or smoke again. They say this is because it was drilled into them that "one drink was equivalent to a crack pipe."<ref>{{Cite web|last=McRady|first=Rachel|date=March 16, 2021|title=Demi Lovato on Deciding to Drink Alcohol and Smoke Weed After Overdose|url=https://www.etonline.com/demi-lovato-on-her-decision-to-consume-alcohol-and-marijuana-in-moderation-following-2018-overdose|access-date=March 18, 2021|website=Entertainment Tonight}}</ref>

In 2021, Lovato said they had initially accepted their bipolar diagnosis and shared this in 2011 because it explained their erratic behavior, but later came to believe it was inaccurate: "I was acting out when I was 18 for many reasons, but I know now from multiple different doctors that it was not because I was bipolar.

Lovato's drug overdose received widespread media coverage, leading to them becoming the most [[Google Search|googled]] person of 2018, ahead of [[Meghan Markle]], [[Brett Kavanaugh]], [[Logan Paul]], and other figures who had received extensive coverage throughout the year, due largely to the public interest surrounding the overdose.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a25552917/google-most-searched-person-of-2018/|title=Google's Most-Searched Person of 2018 is Demi Lovato|publisher=Elle|date=December 18, 2018|access-date=April 18, 2021}}</ref> [[CBS News]] ranked the overdose the 29th biggest story of 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.cbsnews.com/pictures/biggest-stories-of-2018-ranked/|title=Biggest stories of 2018, ranked|publisher=CBS News|date=November 30, 2018|access-date=April 18, 2021}}</ref>

In December 2018, Lovato took to [[Twitter]] to refute rumors regarding their overdose and went on to thank their fans, writing, "If I feel like the world needs to know something, I will tell them MYSELF. All my fans need to know is I'm working hard on myself, I'm happy and clean and I'm SO grateful for their support."<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|first=Bonnie|last=Steirnberg|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8491314/demi-lovato-recovery-response-twitter|title=Demi Lovato Responds to Rumors About Her Recovery|magazine=Billboard|access-date=January 4, 2019}}</ref> They added that some day they would "tell the world what exactly happened, why it happened and what my life is like today&nbsp;.. but until I'm ready to share that with people please stop prying and making up shit that you know nothing about.

Lovato spoke on the matter during a 2020 appearance on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'', where they elaborated on how their worsened struggles with bulimia in 2018 contributed to their eventual drug overdose as they relapsed three months prior to the incident due to being extremely unhappy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/snyde/ny-demi-lovato-discusses-relapse-sobriety-20200305-6tn3b2xpgva75gaoj4r6yomglm-story.html|title=Demi Lovato reveals what led to her 2018 overdose|last=Ganz|first=Jami|website=nydailynews.com|access-date=March 11, 2020}}</ref> The singer attributes these struggles to the extreme measures that their then-manager, Phil McIntyre, took to control the food they ingested.<ref name="popbuzz.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.popbuzz.com/music/artists/demi-lovato/news/manager-phil-mcintyre-eating-disorder-i-love-me/|title=Demi Lovato says her old manager used to "control" what she ate|website=PopBuzz|language=en|access-date=March 16, 2020}}</ref> Lovato further explained that, along with the controlling nature of their management team, they did not provide them with the help they needed: "People checking what my orders at [[Starbucks]] were on my bank statements&nbsp;... just little things like that&nbsp;... it led me to being really unhappy and my bulimia got really bad and I asked for help and I didn't receive the help that I needed."<ref name="popbuzz.com" /> Moreover, they recounted that their thought process the night they relapsed after six years of sobriety was as follows, "I'm six years sober and I'm miserable. I'm even more miserable than I was when I was drinking. Why am I sober?"<ref name="popbuzz.com" /> When Lovato confronted their management about these thoughts, the latter responded with, "You're being very selfish, this would ruin things for not just you but for us as well." This made Lovato feel "completely abandoned" due to triggering their underlying abandonment issues with their birth father, and so they "drank&nbsp;... that night".<ref name="popbuzz.com" />

====Rape trauma====
In 2021, Lovato revealed that they were [[rape]]d at age 15 when they were an actor on the [[Disney Channel]], and that the rapist was a co-star whom they had to continue seeing thereafter. The incident contributed to their bulimia and self-harm. They told someone about the incident, but the attacker "never got in trouble for it. They never got taken out of the movie they were in." Lovato stated they did not recognize the act as rape at the time, since sexual activity was not normalized to them and they were part of the Disney crowd who wore [[purity ring]]s and were waiting until marriage. However, they decided to share their experience because they believe that everyone should "speak their voice if they can and feel comfortable doing so". Lovato also stated they were raped during their 2018 drug overdose, realizing a month after the incident that they were not in a place to consent at that point.<ref>{{cite news|last=Maltceva|first=Margarita|date=March 17, 2021|title='I lost my virginity in a rape': Demi Lovato reveals she was raped as a teenager when she was acting on Disney Channel|work=National Post|url=https://nationalpost.com/news/world/i-lost-my-virginity-in-a-rape-demi-lovato-reveals-she-was-raped-as-a-teenager-when-she-was-acting-on-disney-channel|access-date=March 18, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Horton|first=Adrian|date=March 17, 2021|title=Demi Lovato says she was raped as a teenager by someone she knew|work=The Guardian|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/mar/16/demi-lovato-rape-youtube-docuseries-dancing-with-the-devil|access-date=March 18, 2021}}</ref>
