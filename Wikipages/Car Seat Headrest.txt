'''Car Seat Headrest''' is an American [[indie rock]] band formed in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], and currently located in [[Seattle|Seattle, Washington]]. The band consists of Will Toledo (vocals, guitar, piano, synthesizers), Ethan Ives (guitar, bass, backing vocals), Seth Dalby (bass), and Andrew Katz (drums, percussion, backing vocals).

Beginning as a solo recording project by Toledo in 2010, Car Seat Headrest self-released 12 albums on the music platform [[Bandcamp]] before signing to [[Matador Records]] in 2015. Car Seat Headrest would begin touring as a full band the following year.

==History==

===2010–2014: Lo-fi and solo releases, from ''1'' to ''How to Leave Town''===
Car Seat Headrest began as the solo project of singer/songwriter and multi-instrumentalist Will Toledo (born William Barnes)<ref>{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=Robey|date=2017-06-27|title=Q&A: Car Seat Headrest|url=https://richmondmagazine.com/api/content/4c407748-568d-11e7-a7bb-0a5fbc963f88/|access-date=2020-11-16|website=richmondmagazine.com|language=en-us}}</ref> shortly after he graduated high school. Toledo had previously released music under the alias Nervous Young Men, but after struggling to establish an audience, he decided to change tactics, choosing to try and release more experimental songs anonymously.<ref name=":1">{{Citation|last=carseatheadrest|title=Car Seat Headrest - I Haven't Done Sh*t This Year (TIDAL Documentary)|date=2018-06-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nBnAdgH4UI|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> Toledo chose the name "Car Seat Headrest" as he would often record the vocals to his early albums in the back seat of his car for privacy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu|title=Car Seat Headrest Grows up on Bandcamp|date=November 2, 2015|publisher=The New Yorker|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125210138/http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2015/11/02/growth-spurt-pop-music-hua-hsu|archive-date=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=2016-01-10}}</ref>

Throughout the summer of 2010, Toledo released his first four albums under the Car Seat Headrest name: ''[https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/album/1 1]'', ''[https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/album/2 2]'', ''[https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/album/3 3]'', and ''[https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/album/4 4]''.<ref name=":1" /> ''1'' and ''2'' incorporated less traditional song structures, with stream-of-consciousness lyrics, whereas ''3'' and ''4'' would begin to cement his [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]] indie rock style. Following the numbered albums, Toledo began attending classes at [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], releasing the ''Sunburned Shirts'' EP during his first semester.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://uproxx.com/music/car-seat-headrest-bandcamp-albums/2/|title=A Guide To All Of Car Seat Headrest’s Pre-Fame Albums (All 11 Of Them)|date=2016-10-28|work=UPROXX|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}</ref> The ''Sunburned Shirts'' EP would later be partially combined with his fifth LP, ''5'',<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/track/100-minutes-of-solitude|title=100 minutes of solitude, by Car Seat Headrest|website=Car Seat Headrest|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> to create his first titled album, ''My Back Is Killing Me Baby'', released in March 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/album/my-back-is-killing-me-baby|title=My Back Is Killing Me Baby, by Car Seat Headrest|website=Car Seat Headrest|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref> Songs culled from ''5'' would later appear on the b-sides compilation album ''Little Pieces of Paper with "No" Written on Them''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://carseatheadrest.bandcamp.com/album/little-pieces-of-paper-with-no-written-on-them|title=Little Pieces Of Paper With "No" Written On Them, by Car Seat Headrest|website=Car Seat Headrest|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref>

After a difficult and lonely semester at VCU, Toledo transferred to the [[College of William & Mary]], where he would release his next project, ''[[Twin Fantasy]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/car-seat-headrest-on-going-from-dorm-room-prodigy-to-indie-rock-sensation-225736/|title=Car Seat Headrest: Dorm-Room Prodigy to Indie-Rock Sensation|last=Vozick-Levinson|first=Simon|date=2015-11-24|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=2018-08-21|language=en-US}}</ref> a [[concept album]] centred around a relationship he was in at the time. ''Twin Fantasy'' would later be followed up by 2012's ''Monomania'' and ''Starving While Living'' EP.

Around this time, Toledo began performing live shows with fellow students Katie Wood, Austin Ruhf, and Christian Northover, recording and releasing a short live album in July 2013 entitled ''Live at WCWM: Car Seat Headrest'' at the university's studio''.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whymerecords.bandcamp.com/album/live-at-wcwm-car-seat-headrest|title=Live at WCWM: Car Seat Headrest, by Car Seat Headrest|website=Why Me Records|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> Toledo would release his next project the following month, a two-hour-long [[double album]] entitled ''Nervous Young Man''. Three of the songs, and the title of the album, were taken from his original project, Nervous Young Men, but had been heavily reworked and re-recorded. Released alongside ''Nervous Young Man,'' for those who paid $5 or more, was the outtakes compilation album ''Disjecta Membra''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://carseatheadrest.tumblr.com/post/95234652536/nervous-young-man-by-car-seat-headrest|title=Nervous Young Man, by Car Seat Headrest|website=car seat headrest|access-date=2018-07-17}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Toledo's final solo release was 2014's ''How to Leave Town'', an hour-long EP with heavy electronic instrumentation and more ambitious song structures.

In October 2015, Car Seat Headrest released the compilation album ''[[Teens of Style]]'', their first to not be self-released exclusively via Bandcamp. Shortly after the album's release, Bloom left the group to attend medical school and was replaced by bassist Ethan Ives, who met the band at an open mic.<ref>{{Citation|last=Indieheads Podcast|title=Indieheads Podcast Episode #111: Andrew Katz vs. The Indieheads Podcast|date=2018-02-17|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6AFIRHu0xo|access-date=2018-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Adult of Style: Car Seat Headrest's Teen Confessions Took Him from Bandcamp Stardom to a Real Band|url=https://www.vice.com/en/article/rq4zgv/car-seat-headrest-teens-of-style-interview-profile|access-date=2021-09-12|website=www.vice.com|language=en}}</ref>

Ives played bass throughout most of the recordings for the band's following release, but would later switch to guitar and other instruments, with Seth Dalby taking over on bass.

The original mix of the track was released ten days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1957217/car-seat-headrest-war-is-coming-if-you-want-it/music/|title=Car Seat Headrest – "War Is Coming (If You Want It)"|last=Rettig|first=James|date=August 14, 2017|website=Stereogum|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170815064539/http://www.stereogum.com/1957217/car-seat-headrest-war-is-coming-if-you-want-it/music/|archive-date=August 15, 2017}}</ref>

On December 13, 2017, the band released a re-recorded version of "Beach Life-In-Death", the second track on ''Twin Fantasy,'' through [[Spotify]] without prior announcement.

In August 2018, when asked about new material, Toledo confirmed that he was “demoing out stuff in [[Ableton Live|Ableton]],” adding “there might be some stuff that surprises people who only know us as a rock band, but I don’t think it will come as a surprise to people who are checking out all the deep cuts".<ref>{{Citation|title=Listen to "An Interview with Car Seat Headrest" posted by Matt Wilkinson on Apple Music.|url=https://itunes.apple.com/gb/post/sa.dbc758b0-6b3a-11e8-ba4f-e0430e9b8d19|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> In January 2019, Andrew Katz confirmed the band was recording new music through a video uploaded on Instagram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BsqlEcLhrMU/|title=Andrew Katz on Instagram: "Loser Tuesdays"|website=Instagram|language=en|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>
