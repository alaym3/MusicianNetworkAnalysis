'''Casey''' were a Welsh [[rock music|rock]] band formed in [[South Wales]], [[United Kingdom]] in 2014.

The band formed shortly after vocalist Tom Weaver and guitarist Liam Torrance left previous projects, [[Continents (band)|Continents]] and ''Hot Damn'' respectively.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://lambgoat.com/news/21643/Continents-guitarist-quits-band|title=Continents guitarist quits band|website=Lambgoat.com|access-date=2017-07-17}}</ref> Originally formed as a studio band under the name Well Wisher, Weaver and Torrance later recruited Toby Evans, Max Nicolai, and Scott Edwards, and began producing material with the intention of performing live. After a brief hiatus while Weaver auditioned to join the band [[Northlane]], the name Well Wisher was dropped, and the band relaunched under the name Casey. The name is derived from both Weaver's love of the album ''Casey'' by The Rise of Science, and also Torrance's tribute to the late [[Hawthorne Heights]] guitarist, [[Hawthorne_Heights#Death_of_Casey_Calvert_(2007)|Casey Calvert]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/interview-casey-11062017/|title=INTERVIEW: Casey (11/06/2017)|first=Zach|last=Redrup|website=Deadpress.com|date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>

Following their tour with ''Burning Down Alaska'' and ''Acres'' in April 2015, bassist Scott Edwards stepped down from the band, and was replaced by Adam Smith.

On 1 December 2018 the band released a statement explaining that they have decided to disband following a final UK/European tour and a one-off headline show in the US in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-casey-break-up/|title=NEWS: Casey break up!|first=Zach|last=Redrup|website=Deadpress.co.uk|date=December 1, 2018}}</ref>
