'''The Vaselines''' are a Scottish [[alternative rock]] band. Formed in [[Glasgow]], Scotland in 1986, the band was originally a duo between its songwriters [[Eugene Kelly]] and [[Frances McKee]], but later added James Seenan and Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly on bass and drums respectively from the band [[Secession (band)|Secession]].<ref name="Strong">{{cite book |last=Strong |first=Martin C. |title=The Great Alternative & Indie Discography |url=https://archive.org/details/greatalternative0000stro |url-access=registration |year= 1999 |publisher=Canongate |isbn=0-86241-913-1 }}</ref> McKee had formerly been a member of a band named The Pretty Flowers with [[Duglas T. Stewart]], [[Norman Blake (Scottish musician)|Norman Blake]], Janice McBride and Sean Dickson. Eugene Kelly had formerly played in The Famous Monsters.

==History==
The band formed in 1986, initially as a duo backed by a drum machine. Originally intending to create a fanzine, Kelly and McKee decided to form a band instead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bombmagazine.org/articles/the-vaselines-enter-the-vaselines/|title=The Vaselines: Enter the Vaselines by Eric Schneider - BOMB Magazine|website=Bombmagazine.org}}</ref> Stephen Pastel of [[The Pastels]] is credited with coming up with their name.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.punkglobe.com/thevaselinesinterview1209.html|title=THE VASELINES|website=Punkglobe.com}}</ref> After playing their first gigs, they signed to Pastel's 53rd and 3rd label and recorded the ''[[Son of a Gun (EP)|Son of a Gun]]'' EP with him producing, released in summer 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feelnumb.com/2015/12/01/nirvana-covered-3-songs-by-the-vaselines-made-them-millions/|title=Nirvana Covered 3 Songs By Unknown Band The Vaselines & Made Them Millions|date=1 December 2015|website=Feelnumb.com|access-date=31 March 2019}}</ref> The EP featured a [[cover version|cover]] of [[Divine (actor)|Divine]]'s "You Think You're a Man" on its [[B-side]]. By late 1987, Eugene's brother Charlie Kelly had joined on drums with James Seenan on bass. With this line-up and with Stephen Pastel producing again, they recorded the ''[[Dying for It (EP)|Dying for It]]'' EP, released in early 1988. It featured the songs "[[Candy/Molly's Lips|Molly's Lips]]" and "[[Jesus Wants Me for a Sunbeam]]," both of which [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] would later cover. In June 1989 they released their first album, ''[[Dum-Dum (album)|Dum-Dum]]'', again on 53rd and 3rd but distributed by [[Rough Trade Records|Rough Trade]]. The band broke up shortly after its release due jointly to the dissolution of [[53rd & 3rd#Record label|53rd and 3rd Records]] and the end of Kelly and McKee's romantic relationship. They briefly reformed in October 1990 to open for Nirvana when they played in [[Edinburgh]].

Kelly went on to found the band Captain America (later renamed [[Eugenius (band)|Eugenius]] after legal threats from [[Marvel Comics]]), supporting Nirvana on their UK tour.<ref name="Strong" /> Following solo performances Kelly released the album ''Man Alive'' in 2004. McKee founded the bands Painkillers in 1994 and Suckle in 1997 before releasing her first solo album, ''[[Sunny Moon]]'', in 2006.

Though they were not widely known outside Scotland during their short career, their association with Nirvana brought exposure to the band. Nirvana frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] once described Kelly and McKee as his "favorite songwriters in the whole world".<ref name="Albertson">Albertson, Jeff (2008) "[http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/festivalblog/2008/07/12/you_think_youre_a_man_you_are.html "You Think You're A Man, You Are Only A Boy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519102105/http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/festivalblog/2008/07/12/you_think_youre_a_man_you_are.html |date=19 May 2009 }}", ''[[Seattle Times]]''</ref><ref name="Sandford">[[Christopher Sandford (biographer)|Sandford, Christopher]] (2004) ''Kurt Cobain'', Carroll & Graf, {{ISBN|978-0-7867-1369-1}}, p.242</ref> With their songs "Son of a Gun" and "Molly's Lips" covered on Nirvana's album ''[[Incesticide]]'' and "Jesus Doesn't Want Me for a Sunbeam" covered on ''[[MTV Unplugged in New York]]'', the band gained a new audience. At the 1991 [[Reading Festival]], Kelly joined Nirvana on stage for a performance of "Molly's Lips".<ref name="Strong" /> "I've never made any money apart from my Nirvana royalties," Kelly noted. "It was my tiny bit of rock history, but a strange feeling because by then I was striving for recognition with [[Eugenius (band)|other bands]]. I still haven't come to terms with it, although it allowed me to go on playing, and get a mortgage without having a job."<ref>''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'', March 2000</ref>

In 1992, [[Sub Pop]] released ''[[The Way of the Vaselines: A Complete History]]'', a compilation that contained The Vaselines' entire body of work at the time.

The story of the Vaselines from 1986 to the early 1990s is covered in the 2017 documentary [[Teenage Superstars]], in which both McKee and Kelly feature.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://film.britishcouncil.org/teenage-superstars|title=British Council Film: Teenage Superstars|last=Film|first=British Council|website=Film.britishcouncil.org|access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref>

==Reformation==
[[File:Frances mckee.jpg|thumb|right|Frances McKee with the Vaselines in Portland, OR, 13 May 2009.]]In the summer of 2006, McKee and Kelly took to the stage together for the first time since 1990 to perform a set of Vaselines songs, as part of a joint tour to promote their individual solo albums.

The Vaselines reformed (minus the old rhythm section) on 24 April 2008 for a charity show for the Malawi Orphan Support group at Glasgow's MONO venue. Invitation was by word-of-mouth with no press announcements and the band played to a packed, enthusiastic audience.

The Vaselines performed on 16 May 2008 at Scotland's Tigerfest.<ref>[http://www.nme.com/news/vaselines/36456/ NME: The Vaselines set to reform] – ''NME'', 7 May 2008.

The band also performed at [[Sub Pop]] Records' 20th Anniversary SP20 music festival on 12 July at [[Marymoor Park]] just outside Seattle WA.

On 27 March 2009 they played their first London date in 20 years at the [[London Forum]].
