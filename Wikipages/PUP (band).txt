==History==
===Origins and formation (2010)===
Bassist Nestor Chumak, guitarist Steve Sladkowski, and drummer Zack Mykula are childhood friends who attended school in [[Toronto]] together.<ref name="Exclaim2013">{{cite web |last=Hudson |first=Alex |url=http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/pup-boys_meet_world |title=PUP – Boys, Meet World |publisher=Exclaim.ca |date=October 22, 2013 |access-date=December 1, 2013 |archive-date=November 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112100553/http://exclaim.ca/Interviews/WebExclusive/pup-boys_meet_world |url-status=live }}</ref> Two of them met in [[third grade]], and the third met them in high school at [[Humberside Collegiate Institute]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with PUP: Zack Mykula talks Boy Meets World, Nintendo Nostalgia & Potential Band Name Change |url=https://matmag.net/interview-with-pup-zack-mykula-talks-boy-meets-world-nintendo-nostalgia-potential-band-name-change/ |website=The MAT Magazine |access-date=February 4, 2019 |date=September 24, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603045931/https://matmag.net/interview-with-pup-zack-mykula-talks-boy-meets-world-nintendo-nostalgia-potential-band-name-change/ |archive-date=June 3, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=President's Scholars: 2006–07 Recipients |url=https://www.uoguelph.ca/president/scholarshippresident_07 |website=[[University of Guelph]] |access-date=February 4, 2019 |date=2007 }}{{Dead link|date=December 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Throughout their childhood, they played in a number of bands together. Vocalist and guitarist Stefan Babcock also grew up playing in bands in Toronto. During high school, Babcock was the lead guitarist for a ska band called Stop Drop N Skank that he formed with some of his classmates at [[Earl Haig Secondary School]]. Babcock encountered Chumak, Sladkowski, and Mykula on occasion at local Toronto music venues, but was not close with them at the time.<ref name="PostCity2018">{{cite web |last1=Streitenfeld |first1=Darcy |title=From drama class to lead singer-guitarist of PUP |url=https://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Do/February-2018/From-drama-class-to-lead-guitarist/ |website=Post City Toronto |access-date=February 4, 2019 |language=en |date=February 8, 2018 |archive-date=February 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207020630/https://www.postcity.com/Eat-Shop-Do/Do/February-2018/From-drama-class-to-lead-guitarist/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

After high school, Babcock's band Stop Drop N Skank dissolved. While attending [[Ryerson University]], he worked with Nestor Chumak to record a song he had written for a school project.<ref name="PostCity2018"/> Following its completion, the duo teamed up with Chumak's friends Sladkowski and Mykula to form a group called '''Topanga'''. The name comes from Topanga Matthews, a character on the 1990s [[Disney]] sitcom ''[[Boy Meets World]]'' whom the band has called "our first middle-school crush."<ref name="RenameTumblr">{{cite web |author1=PUP |title=We used to be called Topanga.

===Early days as a band (2011–2013)===
[[File:Topanga at Mavericks (7055929949).jpg|thumb|left|Topanga performing at a bar in Ottawa in 2012]]

Shortly after the release of their debut EP, the band began performing live together. They played their first show ever at the [[Bovine Sex Club]] in January 2011.<ref name="RedBull2014">{{cite web |last1=Sharp |first1=Elliott |title=We Hung Out Under a Bridge in Austin With PUP |url=https://www.redbull.com/us-en/we-hung-out-under-a-bridge-in-austin-with-pup |website=Red Bull |access-date=February 4, 2019 |date=April 7, 2014 |archive-date=February 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190207014827/https://www.redbull.com/us-en/we-hung-out-under-a-bridge-in-austin-with-pup |url-status=live }}</ref> According to Babcock, the EP was gaining traction online, and they began receiving increasingly better show offers. By the beginning of 2012, they had begun touring with [[Hollerado]] and were signed to Hollerado's label, [[Royal Mountain Records]]. On February 15, 2012, they released the two-track ''Oceans 7"'' with Royal Mountain.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Topanga |title=Oceans |url=https://soundcloud.com/topangatopanga/sets/oceans-7-inch |website=SoundCloud |access-date=February 4, 2019 |language=en |date=January 9, 2012 |archive-date=November 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129075125/https://soundcloud.com/topangatopanga/sets/oceans-7-inch |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2012, Topanga began contemplating making their first full-length album, and wanted to find a producer who could help them capture their heavy performance style in a studio recording.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Elbert|first1=Tarian|title=Producer Dave Schiffman nails the punk hook for Toronto's PUP|url=http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2013/10/17/producer-dave-schiffman-nails-the-punk-hook-for-torontos-pup.html|access-date=January 7, 2018|work=Metro News|date=October 17, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321100924/http://www.metronews.ca/entertainment/2013/10/17/producer-dave-schiffman-nails-the-punk-hook-for-torontos-pup.html|archive-date=March 21, 2018}}</ref> Inspired by [[The Bronx (band)|The Bronx]]'s [[The Bronx (2008 album)|2008 self-titled album]], they were interested in working with its producer, Dave Schiffman, an industry veteran who had worked with artists such as [[Rage Against the Machine]], [[Weezer]], and [[Anti-Flag]]. They sent him a demo and, to their surprise, he liked it and soon flew to Toronto to begin working on their album.<ref name="Exclaim2013"/> The album was recorded in [[Montréal]], in a studio that belongs to professional former [[F1]] driver [[Jacques Villeneuve]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Eff |first1=Billy |title=On discute avec PUP, le groupe torontois qui refuse de mourir |url=https://www.vice.com/fr_ca/article/3kk87j/on-discute-avec-pup-le-groupe-torontois-qui-refuse-de-mourir |website=VICE Québec |publisher=VICE |access-date=4 May 2020 |archive-date=November 29, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129075111/https://www.vice.com/fr/article/3kk87j/on-discute-avec-pup-le-groupe-torontois-qui-refuse-de-mourir |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Topanga is now called PUP web banner.jpg|thumb|right|A banner from Topanga's [[Bandcamp]] site announcing the new name and logo]]
While working on the album, the band decided to change their name from Topanga to something else. According to Babcock, they felt the name was less fitting now that they had locked down a heavy punk rock style (as opposed to the lighter rock style they had played early on).<ref name="Exclaim2013"/> In addition, Disney had announced a [[Girl Meets World|new spinoff series]] based on ''Boy Meets World'', and the band didn't want to be associated with it.<ref name="RenameTumblr"/> After a few months of uncertainty, they decided on the name '''PUP'''. The name is an acronym of a quote by Babcock's grandmother, who said that playing in a rock band was a "pathetic use of potential."<ref name="RedBull2014"/> The band officially announced their new name via social media on April 16, 2013.<ref name="RenameTumblr"/>

PUP made a list of dream producers they would like to work with. On the top of the list was Dave Schiffman. PUP sent demos to producer Dave Schiffman, he was the first person to receive them. Within three days, he messaged back and said he was in. A week later he arrived in Toronto. It was his enthusiasm for the band that caused the members to quit their day jobs and take PUP to the next level.<ref>In It To Spin It Interview</ref>
The upcoming album's release date was set for October 8, 2013.<ref name="Check out Toronto Punk Band – PUP"/> From September to the end of November 2013, PUP joined [[Hollerado]] and [[the Zolas]] on a 24-stop tour across Canada to promote the album. Upon its release, the self-titled debut album, ''PUP'', was met with critical praise.
