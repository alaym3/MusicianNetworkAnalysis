He also sang on several songs, such as "[[Naughty Boys|Kimi ni Mune Kyun]]" (1983).

Sakamoto released his first solo album ''[[Thousand Knives|Thousand Knives of Ryūichi Sakamoto]]'' in mid-1978 with the help of [[Hideki Matsutake]]—Hosono also contributed to the song "Thousand Knives". The album experimented with different styles, such as "Thousand Knives" and "The End of Asia"—in which electronic music was [[Fusion (music)|fused]] with traditional [[Music of Japan|Japanese music]]—while "Grasshoppers" is a more [[Minimalistic music|minimalistic]] piano song. The album was recorded from April to July 1978 with a variety of [[electronic musical instrument]]s, including various synthesizers, such as the [[Korg PS-3300|KORG PS-3100]], a [[polyphonic synthesizer]]; the [[Oberheim polyphonic|Oberheim Eight-Voice]]; the [[Moog synthesizer|Moog III-C]]; the [[Polymoog]], the [[Minimoog]]; the [[Micromoog]]; the [[Korg VC-10]], which is a vocoder; the [[Korg MS-20|KORG SQ-10]], which is an [[analog sequencer]]; the [[Pollard Syndrum|Syn-Drums]], an [[electronic drum]] kit; and the [[microprocessor]]-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer]], which is a [[music sequencer]] that was programmed by Matsutake and played by Sakamoto.<ref>{{Discogs release|325757|Ryuichi Sakamoto – Thousand Knives Of (LP)}}</ref><ref>{{Discogs release|1156483|Ryuichi Sakamoto – Thousand Knives Of (CD)}}</ref> A version of the song "Thousand Knives" was released on the Yellow Magic Orchestra's 1981 album ''[[BGM (album)|BGM]]''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra – BGM|url=http://www.discogs.com/Yellow-Magic-Orchestra-BGM/release/359437|website=Yellow Magic Orchestra on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=June 22, 2014|year=2014}}</ref> This version was one of the earliest uses of the [[Roland TR-808]] [[drum machine]], for YMO's live performance of "1000 Knives" in 1980 and their ''BGM'' album release in 1981.

===1980s===
In 1980, Sakamoto released the solo album ''B-2 Unit'', which has been referred to as his "edgiest" record<ref name="buckley"/> and is known for the electronic song "Riot in Lagos",<ref name="buckley">{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Peter|title=The rough guide to rock|year=2003|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|isbn=1-84353-105-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PT908|access-date=May 25, 2011|page=901}}</ref> which is considered an early example of [[electro music]] (electro-funk),<ref name="broughton_2007">{{cite book|last=Broughton|first=Frank|title=La historia del DJ / The DJ's Story, Volume 2|year=2007|publisher=Ediciones Robinbook|isbn=978-84-96222-79-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1GMxP6mpRdgC&pg=PA121|access-date=May 25, 2011|page=121}}</ref><ref name="mantronik_interview"/> as Sakamoto anticipated the beats and sounds of electro.<ref name="wire_1996">{{citation|title=A-Z Of Electro|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=145|date=March 1996|author=David Toop|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/|access-date=May 29, 2011}}</ref> Early electro and hip hop artists, such as [[Afrika Bambaata]]<ref name="wire_1996"/> and [[Kurtis Mantronik]], were influenced by the album—especially "Riot in Lagos"—with Mantronik citing the work as a major influence on his electro hip hop group [[Mantronix]].<ref name="mantronik_interview">{{citation|title=Kurtis Mantronik Interview|work=Hip Hop Storage|date=July 2002|url=http://www.cheebadesign.com/legends/articleX.html|access-date=May 25, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524234641/http://www.cheebadesign.com/legends/articleX.html|archive-date=May 24, 2011}}</ref> "Riot in Lagos" was later included in [[Playgroup (band)|Playgroup]]'s [[compilation album]] ''Kings of Electro'' (2007), alongside other significant electro compositions, such as [[Hashim Music|Hashim]]'s "Al-Naafyish" (1983).<ref>{{allMusic|album|r2003688|Kings of Electro}}</ref>

According to ''Dusted Magazine'', Sakamoto's use of squelching [[Bounce music|bounce]] sounds and mechanical [[Beat (music)|beats]] was later incorporated in early electro and [[hip hop music]] productions, such as “[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|Message II (Survival)]]” (1982), by [[Melle Mel]] and [[Duke Bootee]]; “[[Whodini (album)|Magic's Wand]]” (1982), by [[Whodini]] and [[Thomas Dolby]]; Twilight 22's “Electric Kingdom” (1983); and Kurt Mantronik's ''[[Mantronix: The Album]]'' (1985).<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Connell|first=Jake|title=Dusted Reviews – Mantronix: The Album (Deluxe Edition)|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/reviews/4485|work=Dusted Magazine|access-date=July 21, 2011|date=August 22, 2008}}</ref> The 1980 release of "Riot in Lagos" was listed by ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2011 as one of the 50 key events in the history of [[dance music]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Vine|first=Richard|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto records Riot In Lagos|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/ryuichi-sakamoto-riot-in-lagos|work=The Guardian |location=UK|date=July 9, 2011|access-date=July 9, 2011}}</ref>

Among other tracks on ''B-2 Unit'', "Differencia" has, according to ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]'', "relentless tumbling beats and a stabbing [[bass synth]] that foreshadows [[Oldschool jungle|jungle]] by nearly a decade". Some tracks on the album also foreshadow genres such as [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]], [[broken beat]], and [[industrial techno]], and the work of producers such as [[Actress (musician)|Actress]] and [[Oneohtrix Point Never]]. For several tracks on the album, Sakamoto worked with UK [[reggae]] producer [[Dennis Bovell]], incorporating elements of [[afrobeat]] and [[dub music]].<ref>[http://www.factmag.com/2015/01/22/the-essential-yellow-magic-orchestra/ The Essential... Yellow Magic Orchestra], ''[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]''</ref>

Also in 1980, Sakamoto released the single "War Head/Lexington Queen", an experimental [[synthpop]] and electro record,<ref>{{Discogs master|185050|Riuichi Sakamoto – Warhead / Lexington Queen|class=single}}</ref> and began a long-standing collaboration with [[David Sylvian]], when he co-wrote and performed on the [[Japan (band)|Japan]] track "Taking Islands In Africa". In the following year, Sakamoto collaborated with [[Talking Heads]] and [[King Crimson]] guitarist [[Adrian Belew]] and [[Robin Scott (singer)|Robin Scott]] for an album titled ''Left-Handed Dream''. Following Japan's dissolution, Sakamoto worked on another collaboration with Sylvian, a single entitled "[[Bamboo Houses|Bamboo Houses/Bamboo Music]]" in 1982. Sakamoto's 1980 collaboration with [[Kiyoshiro Imawano]], "Ikenai Rouge Magic", topped the [[Oricon]] singles chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|publisher=Kiyoshiro Imawano official site|url=http://www.kiyoshiro.co.jp/history/index.html|access-date=June 22, 2011|language=ja}} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http://www.kiyoshiro.co.jp/history/index.html Translation])</ref>

In 1983, Sakamoto starred alongside [[David Bowie]] in director [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence|Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence]]''. In addition to acting in the film, Sakamoto also composed the film's musical score and again collaborated with Sylvian on the film's main theme ("[[Forbidden Colours]]") – which became a minor hit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}} In a 2016 interview, Sakamoto reflected on his time acting in the film, claiming that he "hung out" with Bowie every evening for a month while filming on location. He remembered Bowie as "straightforward" and "nice", while also lamenting the fact that he never mustered the courage to ask for Bowie's help while scoring the film's soundtrack as he believed Bowie was too "concentrated on acting".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowe|first1=Miles|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto reflects on his unique time with David Bowie|url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/01/13/ryuichi-sakamoto-david-bowie/|website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]|publisher=[[The Vinyl Factory]]|access-date=January 18, 2016|date=January 13, 2016}}</ref>

Sakamoto released a number of solo albums during the 1980s. While primarily focused on the piano and synthesizer, this series of albums included collaborations with artists such as Sylvian, [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]], [[Thomas Dolby]], [[Nam June Paik]], and [[Iggy Pop]]. Sakamoto would alternated between exploring a variety of musical styles and focusing on a specific subject or theme, such as the Italian [[Futurism]] movement.{{Citation needed|date=January 2021}}

As his solo career began to extend outside Japan in the late 1980s, Sakamoto's explorations, influences and collaborators also developed further. ''[[Beauty (Ryuichi Sakamoto album)|Beauty]]'' (1989) features a track list that combines pop with traditional Japanese and [[Okinawan music|Okinawan songs]], as well as guest appearances by [[Jill Jones]], [[Robert Wyatt]], [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Robbie Robertson]]. ''[[Heartbeat (Sakamoto album)|Heartbeat]]'' (1991) and ''Sweet Revenge'' (1994) features Sakamoto's collaborations with a global range of artists such as [[Roddy Frame]], Dee Dee Brave, Marco Prince, [[Arto Lindsay]], [[Youssou N'Dour]], [[David Sylvian]] and [[Ingrid Chavez]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto – Sweet Revenge|url=http://www.discogs.com/Ryuichi-Sakamoto-Sweet-Revenge/release/165006|website=Ryuchi Sakamoto on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=June 22, 2014|year=2014}}</ref>

===1990s===
In 1995 Sakamoto released ''Smoochy'', described by the ''Sound On Sound'' website as Sakamoto's "excursion into the land of easy-listening and Latin", followed by the ''[[1996 (Ryuichi Sakamoto album)|1996]]'' album, which featured a number of previously released pieces arranged for solo piano, violin and cello.<ref name="Sos">{{cite web|title=RYUICHI SAKAMOTO: Classical & Pop Fusion|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr98/articles/sakamoto.html|website=Sound On Sound|publisher=SOS Publications Group|access-date=June 22, 2014|date=April 1998}}</ref> During December 1996 Sakamoto, composed the entirety of an hour-long orchestral work entitled "Untitled 01" and released as the album ''Discord'' (1998).<ref name="Sos" /> The [[Sony Classical]] release of ''Discord'' was sold in a [[Jewel case#Jewel case|jewel case]] that was covered by a blue-colored [[slipcase]] made of [[Metal leaf|foil]], while the CD also contained a data video track. In 1998 the [[Ninja Tune]] record label released the ''Prayer/Salvation Remixes'', for which prominent electronica artists such as Ashley Beedle and Andrea Parker remixed sections from the "Prayer" and "Salvation" parts of ''Discord''.<ref>{{cite web|title=PRAYER / SALVATION REMIXES|url=http://ninjatune.net/de/release/ryuichi-sakamoto/prayer-salvation-remixes|website=Ninja Tune|publisher=Ninja Tune|access-date=June 22, 2014|date=June 22, 2014}}</ref> Sakamoto collaborated primarily with guitarist David Torn and [[DJ Spooky]]—artist [[Laurie Anderson]] provides spoken word on the composition—and the recording was condensed from nine live performances of the work, recorded during a Japanese tour. ''Discord'' was divided into four parts: "Grief", "Anger", "Prayer" and "Salvation"; Sakamoto explained in 1998 that he was "not religious, but maybe spiritual" and "The Prayer is to anybody or anything you want to name." Sakamoto further explained:

{{quote|The themes of Prayer and Salvation came out of the feelings of sadness and frustration that I expressed in the first two movements, about the fact that people are starving in the world, and we are not able to help them. People are dying, and yet the political and economical and historical situations are too complicated and inert for us to do much about it. So I got really angry with myself. I asked myself what I could do, and since there's not a lot I can do on the practical level, all that's left for me is to pray. But it's not enough just to pray; I also had to think about actually saving those people, so the last movement is called Salvation. That's the journey of the piece.<ref name="Sos" />}}

In 1998, Italian ethnomusicologist [[Massimo Milano]] published ''[[Ryuichi Sakamoto. Conversazioni]]'' through the Padova, Arcana imprint. All three editions of the book were published in the [[Italian language]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Showing all editions for 'Ryuichi Sakamoto : conversazioni'|publisher=OCLC|year=2001–2014|oclc=801212773}}</ref> Sakamoto's next album, ''[[BTTB (album)|BTTB]]'' (1998)—an [[acronym]] for "Back to the Basics"—was a fairly opaque reaction to the prior year's multilayered, lushly orchestrated ''Discord''. The album comprised a series of original pieces on solo piano, including "Energy Flow" (a major hit in Japan) and a frenetic, four-hand arrangement of the Yellow Magic Orchestra classic "Tong Poo". On the ''BTTB'' U.S. tour, he opened the show performing a brief [[avant-garde]] [[Turntablism|DJ]] set under the stage name DJ Lovegroove.

Sakamoto's long-awaited "opera" ''LIFE'' was released in 1999, with visual direction by [[Shiro Takatani]], artistic director of [[Dumb Type]]. It premiered with seven sold-out performances in Tokyo and Osaka. This ambitious multi-genre multi-media project featured contributions by over 100 performers, including [[Pina Bausch]], [[Bernardo Bertolucci]], [[Josep Carreras]], [[The 14th Dalai Lama|the Dalai Lama]] and [[Salman Rushdie]].

===2000s===

Sakamoto teamed with cellist [[Jaques Morelenbaum]] (a member of his ''1996'' trio), and Morelenbaum's wife, [[Paula Morelenbaum|Paula]], on a pair of albums celebrating the work of [[bossa nova]] pioneer [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]]. They recorded their first album, ''Casa'' (2001), mostly in Jobim's home studio in [[Rio de Janeiro]], with Sakamoto performing on the late Jobim's grand piano. The album was well received, having been included in the list of ''[[The New York Times]]''{{'}}s top albums of 2002. A live album, ''Live in Tokyo'', and a second album, ''A Day in New York'', soon followed. Sakamoto and the Morelenbaums would also collaborate on N.M.L. No More Landmine, an international effort to raise awareness for the removal of landmines. The trio would release the single "Zero Landmine", which also featured [[David Sylvian]], [[Brian Eno]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Cyndi Lauper]], and [[Haruomi Hosono]] & [[Yukihiro Takahashi]], the other two founding members of [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]], amongst nearly one hundred other performers.

Sakamoto collaborated with [[Alva Noto]] (an alias of [[Carsten Nicolai]]) to release ''[[Vrioon]]'', an album of Sakamoto's piano clusters treated by Nicolai's unique style of digital manipulation, involving the creation of "micro-loops" and minimal percussion. The two produced this work by passing the pieces back and forth until both were satisfied with the result. This debut, released on German label [[Raster-Noton]], was voted record of the year 2004 in the electronica category by British magazine ''[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]''. They then released ''[[Insen]]'' (2005)—while produced in a similar manner to Vrioon, this album is somewhat more restrained and minimalist. They keep on collaborating and have released two more albums: ''[[Utp (album)|utp_]]'' (2008)<ref>{{cite web|last1=Couture|first1=François|title=Alva Noto / Ensemble Modern / Ryuichi Sakamoto: utp_|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/utp--mw0000818684|website=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=January 14, 2016}}</ref> and ''[[Summvs]]'' (2011).<ref>{{cite web|title=Alva Noto + Ryuichi Sakamoto – Summvs|url=http://www.discogs.com/Alva-Noto-Ryuichi-Sakamoto-Summvs/release/2842932|website=[[Discogs]]|publisher=discogs.com|access-date=January 18, 2016}}</ref>

In 2005, [[Finland|Finnish]] mobile phone manufacturer [[Nokia]] hired Sakamoto to compose ring and alert tones for their high-end phone, the [[Nokia 8800]]. In 2006, Nokia offered the ringtones for free on their website.<ref>[https://www.wired.com/2006/11/sakamoto_ringto/ Sakamoto Ringtones Offered to All]  ''https://www.wired.com/''; Retrieved September 9, 2015.</ref> Around this time, a reunion with YMO cofounders Hosono and Takahashi caused a stir in the Japanese press. They released a single "Rescue" in 2007 and a DVD "HAS/YMO" in 2008. In July 2009, Sakamoto was honored as [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres|Officier of Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] at the French embassy in Tokyo.

===2010s–present===

Throughout the latter part of the 2000s, Sakamoto collaborated on several projects with visual artist [[Shiro Takatani]], including the installations ''LIFE - fluid, invisible, inaudible...'' (2007–2013), commissioned by YCAM, Yamaguchi, ''collapsed'' and ''silence spins'' at the Museum of Contemporary Art Tokyo in 2012 and 2013 Sharjah Biennial (U.A.E.), ''LIFE-WELL'' in 2013 and a special version for Park Hyatt Tokyo's 20th anniversary in 2014, and he did music for the joint performance ''LIFE-WELL'' featuring the actor Noh/Kyogen Mansai Nomura, and for [[Shiro Takatani]]'s performance ''ST/LL'' in 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digicult.it/news/the-scene-is-a-prism-notes-about-stll-of-shiro-takatani|title=The Scene is a Prism.

In 2013, Sakamoto was a jury member at the [[70th Venice International Film Festival]]. The jury viewed 20 films and was chaired by filmmaker [[Bernardo Bertolucci]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/cinema/news/07-09.html|title=Juries and Awards of the 70th Venice Film Festival |work=La Biennale|access-date=June 22, 2014|date=September 7, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, Sakamoto became the first Guest Artistic Director of [[The Sapporo International Art Festival]] 2014 (SIAF2014).
On July 10, Sakamoto released a statement indicating that he had been diagnosed with [[oropharyngeal cancer]] in late June of the same year. He announced a break from his work while he sought treatment and recovery.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/japanrealtime/2014/07/10/ryuichi-sakamoto-diagnosed-with-throat-cancer/|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto diagnosed with Throat Cancer|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=July 10, 2014|last1=Hongo|first1=Jun}}</ref> On August 3, 2015, Sakamoto posted on his website that he was "in great shape ...

==Production work==
Sakamoto's production credits represent a prolific career in this role. In 1983, he produced [[Mari Iijima]]'s debut album ''Rosé'', the same year that the Yellow Magic Orchestra was disbanded.<ref>{{cite web|title=飯島真理* – Rosé|url=http://www.discogs.com/飯島真理-Rosé/release/3915750|website=飯島真理* on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=June 22, 2014|year=2014}}</ref> Sakamoto subsequently worked with artists such as [[Thomas Dolby]];<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas Dolby – Silk Pyjamas|url=http://www.discogs.com/Thomas-Dolby-Silk-Pyjamas/master/138197|website=Thomas Dolby on Discogs|publisher=Discogs|access-date=June 22, 2014|year=2014}}</ref> [[Aztec Camera]], on the ''[[Dreamland (Aztec Camera album)|Dreamland]]'' (1993) album;<ref name="Giles">{{cite news|author1=Giles Smith|title=MUSIC / The Roddy and Ryuichi roadshow: When Roddy Frame wanted to make his new album with Ryuichi Sakamoto, he had to wait in line.

[[Roddy Frame]], who worked with Sakamoto as a member of Aztec Camera, explained in a 1993 interview preceding the release of ''Dreamland'' that he had had to wait a lengthy period of time before he was able to work with Sakamoto, who wrote two soundtracks, a solo album and the music for the opening ceremony at the [[1992 Summer Olympics|Barcelona Olympics]], prior to working with Frame over four weeks in a New York studio. Frame said that he was impressed by the work of YMO and the ''Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence'' soundtrack, explaining: "That's where you realise that the atmosphere around his compositions is actually in the writing - it's got nothing to do with synthesisers." Frame's decision to ask Sakamoto was finalized after he saw his performance at the Japan Festival that was held in London, United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|title=change title in ref to match source|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50oDFsCDVLM|website=mrjbroberts on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|access-date=June 22, 2014|format=Video upload|date=March 10, 2013}}</ref> Of his experience recording with Sakamoto, Frame said:

{{quote|He's got this reputation as a boffin, a professor of music who sits in front of a computer screen. But he's more intuitive than that, and he's always trying to corrupt what he knows. Halfway through the day in the studio, he will stop and play some hip hop or some house for 10 minutes, and then go back to what he was doing. He's always trying to trip himself up like that, and to discover new things. Just before we worked together he'd been out in Borneo, I think, with a DAT machine, looking for new sounds.<ref name="Giles" />}}

==Film work==
Sakamoto began working in films, as a composer and actor, in [[Nagisa Oshima]]'s ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence|Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983), for which he composed the score, [[Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence (instrumental)|title theme]], and the duet "[[Forbidden Colours]]" with [[David Sylvian]]. Sakamoto later composed [[Bernardo Bertolucci]]'s ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987), which earned him the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] with fellow composers [[David Byrne (musician)|David Byrne]] and [[Cong Su]]. In that same year, he composed the score to the cult-classic [[anime]] film ''[[Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise|Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honnêamise]]''. Sakamoto also went on to compose the score of the opening ceremony for the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona, Spain, telecast live to an audience of over a billion viewers.

Other films scored by Sakamoto include [[Pedro Almodóvar]]'s ''[[Pedro Almodóvar#Tacones Lejanos (1991)|Tacones lejanos (High Heels)]]'' (1991); Bertolucci's ''[[Little Buddha|The Little Buddha]]'' (1993); [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Wild Palms]]'' (1993); [[John Maybury]]'s ''[[Love Is the Devil: Study for a Portrait of Francis Bacon]]'' (1998); [[Brian De Palma]]'s ''[[Snake Eyes (1998 film)|Snake Eyes]]'' (1998) and ''[[Femme Fatale (2002 film)|Femme Fatale]]'' (2002); Oshima's ''[[Gohatto]]'' (1999); and [[Jun Ichikawa]]'s (director of the Mitsui ReHouse commercial from 1997 to 1999 starring [[Chizuru Ikewaki]] and [[Mao Inoue]]) ''[[Tony Takitani]]'' (2005).

Several tracks from Sakamoto's earlier solo albums have also appeared in film soundtracks. In particular, variations of "Chinsagu No Hana" (from ''Beauty'') and "Bibo No Aozora" (from ''1996'') provide the poignant closing pieces for Sue Brooks's ''[[Japanese Story]]'' (2003) and [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]]'s ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]'' (2006), respectively. In 2015, Sakamoto teamed up with Iñárritu to score his film, ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]'' starring [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Tom Hardy]].<ref name="FMR" />

Sakamoto has also acted in several films: perhaps his most notable performance was as the conflicted Captain Yonoi in ''[[Merry Christmas Mr Lawrence]]'', alongside [[Takeshi Kitano]] and British rock singer [[David Bowie]]. He also played roles in ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (as [[Masahiko Amakasu]]) and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Rain (Madonna song)|Rain]]" music video.

==Personal life==
Sakamoto's first of three marriages occurred in 1972, but ended in divorce two years later—Sakamoto has a daughter from this relationship. Sakamoto then married popular Japanese pianist and singer [[Akiko Yano]] in 1982, following several musical collaborations with her, including touring work with the [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Sakamoto's second marriage ended in August 2006, 14 years after a mutual decision to live separately—Yano and Sakamoto raised one daughter, [[J-pop]] singer [[Miu Sakamoto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.e-entertainment.info/singer/sakamoto_ryuuichi/post_9.html|work=e-entertainment.info|title=坂本龍一、矢野顕子が仮面夫婦の関係に終止符|date=November 29, 2006|access-date=June 9, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721195818/http://news.e-entertainment.info/singer/sakamoto_ryuuichi/post_9.html|archive-date=July 21, 2011|url-status=dead}} [https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ja&tl=en&u=http://news.e-entertainment.info/singer/sakamoto_ryuuichi/post_9.html Translation]</ref> He has lived with his manager and wife Norika Sora since around 1990 and has two children with her.

Beginning in June 2014, Sakamoto took a year-long hiatus after he was diagnosed with oropharyngeal cancer. In 2015, he returned, stating: "Right now I'm good. I feel better. Much, much better. I feel energy inside, but you never know. The cancer might come back in three years, five years, maybe 10 years. Also the radiation makes your immune system really low. It means I'm very susceptible to another cancer in my body."<ref name=WeingartenRS2015>{{cite journal|last1=Weingarten|first1=Christopher R.|title=Ryuichi Sakamoto Details 'Gigantic' Score to 'Birdman' Director's 'The Revenant'i|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 17, 2015|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ryuichi-sakamoto-details-gigantic-score-to-birdman-directors-the-revenant-20151217}}</ref>

On January 21, 2021, Sakamoto shared a link on his official pages, which contained a letter announcing that though his [[throat cancer]] went into remission, he was now diagnosed with [[rectal cancer]], and that he's currently undergoing treatment after a successful surgery. He wrote: "From now on, I will be living alongside cancer. But, I am hoping to make music for a little while longer."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sitesakamoto.com/home|title = SiteSakamoto|date=21 January 2021}}</ref>

===Activism===
Sakamoto is a member of the [[anti-nuclear]] organization [[Stop Rokkasho]] and has demanded the closing of the [[Hamaoka Nuclear Power Plant]].<ref>[http://www.geocities.co.jp/genpatusinsai/ 東海地震＋浜岡原発 ～ 原発震災を防ぐ全国署名] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607213713/http://www.geocities.co.jp/genpatusinsai/ |date=June 7, 2014 }} {{in lang|ja}}</ref> In 2012, he organized the No Nukes 2012 concert, which featured performances by 18 groups, including Yellow Magic Orchestra and [[Kraftwerk]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Kraftwerk, YMO sing the No Nukes rally cry|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120708b5.html|access-date=July 17, 2012|newspaper=[[The Japan Times]]|date=July 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The No Nukes 2012 Concert and the Role of Musicians in the Anti-Nuclear Movement|url=http://www.japanfocus.org/-Noriko-MANABE/3799|access-date=July 17, 2012|newspaper=The Asia-Pacific Journal|date=July 16, 2012}}</ref> Sakamoto is also known as a critic of [[copyright law]], arguing in 2009 that it is antiquated in the [[information age]]. He argued that in "the last 100 years, only a few organizations have dominated the music world and ripped off both fans and creators" and that "with the internet we are going back to having tribal attitudes towards music."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/may/19/turning-japanese-ryuichi-sakamoto|title=Turning Japanese: The Philosophy of Ryuichi Sakamoto|work=The Guardian |location=UK|first=Alex|last=Hoban|date=May 19, 2009|access-date=July 16, 2011}}</ref>

===Commmons===
{{Main|Commmons}}
In 2006 Sakamoto, in collaboration with Japanese music company [[Avex Group]], founded {{Nihongo|[[Commmons]]|コモンズ|Komonzu}}, a [[record label]] seeking to change the manner in which music is produced. Sakamoto has explained that Commmons is not his label, but is a platform for all aspiring artists to join as equal collaborators to share the benefits of the [[music industry]]. On the initiative's "About" page, the label is described as a project that "aims to find new possibilities for music, while making meaningful contribution to culture and society". The name "Commmons" is spelt with three "m"s because the third "m" stands for music.<ref>{{cite web|title=about commmons|url=http://www.commmons.com/about/index_eng.html|website=Commmons|publisher=commmons/AMI|access-date=June 22, 2014|date=June 22, 2014}}</ref>

==Awards and nominations==
Sakamoto has won a number of awards for his work as a film composer, beginning winning the [[BAFTA Award for Best Film Music]] with his score for ''[[Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence]]'' (1983).<ref name="imdb_sakamoto">{{IMDb name|0757098|Ryûichi Sakamoto}}</ref> His greatest award success was for scoring ''[[The Last Emperor]]'' (1987), which won him the [[Academy Award for Best Original Score]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score]], and [[Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack Album for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media]],<ref name="boston_sullivan"/> as well as a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]] nomination.<ref name="imdb_sakamoto"/>

The music video for "Risky", written and directed by Meiert Avis, also won the first ever MTV "[[MTV Video Music Award|Breakthrough Video Award]]".{{Citation needed|reason=Not listed at http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/archive/winners-by-category.jhtml|date=February 2014}} The ground breaking video explores [[transhumanist]] philosopher [[FM-2030]]'s (Persian: فریدون اسفندیاری) ideas of "Nostalgia for the Future", in the form of an imagined love affair between a robot and one of [[Man Ray]]'s models in Paris in the late 1930s. Additional inspiration was drawn from [[Jean Baudrillard]], [[Edvard Munch]]'s 1894 painting  "[[Puberty (Munch painting)|Puberty]]", and [[Roland Barthes]] "[[Death of the Author]]". The surrealist black and white video uses stop motion, light painting, and other retro in-camera effects techniques. Meiert Avis shot Sakamoto while at work on the score for "The Last Emperor" in London. Sakamoto also appears in the video painting words and messages to an open shutter camera. Iggy Pop, who performs the vocals on "Risky", chose not to appear in the video, allowing his performance space to be occupied by the surrealist era robot.

Sakamoto won the Golden Pine Award (Lifetime Achievement) at the 2013 International Samobor Film Music Festival, along with [[Clint Eastwood]] and [[Gerald Fried]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isfmf.com/clint-eastwood-ryuichi-sakamoto-gerald-fried-receive-golden-pine-awards-lifetime-achievement/ |title=Clint Eastwood, Ryuichi Sakamoto And Gerald Fried To Receive Golden Pine Awards For Lifetime Achievement |publisher=ISFMF |date=October 18, 2013 |access-date=May 15, 2014}}</ref>
