== Career ==
In early 2010, Juls began to produce music casually. His first break occurred once he produced a song for Show Dem Camp entitled "Feel Alright" in 2012, and he began to DJ while finishing his studies in Surrey in 2013.<ref name=":1" /> Once his work gained significant traction, he began to release his own music,  including "Teef Teef," "With You," and "Give You Love,". His debut album entitled ''Leap of Faith'' followed in 2017 with ''Ojekoo'', which featured [[Kojey Radical]] ("Temperature Rising"), [[Maleek Berry]] and [[Nonso Amadi]] ("Early"), and [[Eugy]], [[Not3s]], and [[Kojo Funds]] ("Bad"). These albums both gained over 30 million streams on all major streaming platforms that year.<ref name="Juls">{{Cite web|title=Juls|url=https://www.amsterdam-dance-event.nl/en/artists-speakers/juls/39369/|access-date=2020-07-13|website=ADE|language=en}}</ref>

<blockquote>“I don’t think there is anything wrong with our content. Look at all the quality videos that our artistes are putting out. Boasting our culture and our identity. The western media isn’t used to this new narrative. As our music scene gets bigger, it’s getting harder to ignore because African Pop music is what is hot right now. Look around you. Our influence is all over everything from film, to music to fashion. Also, I don’t think our aim or my aim anyways is to rub shoulders with “foreign counterparts”. It’s about spreading the culture and our music and getting heard. We haven’t had those resources and access to major funding that’s the only issue. And most African artistes are now getting educated on the business side of things so we don’t get cheated. It takes time. Illiteracy has been Africa’s major problem for developing as a continent. First solution is to take pride in our culture and educate ourselves first.”<ref name=":0" /><ref>[https://www.blanckdigital.com/the-interview-juls-on-neo-africanism-and-the-african-music-industry-2/ Juls in an interview with BlanckDigital]</ref></blockquote>
