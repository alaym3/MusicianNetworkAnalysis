'''Marduk''' is a Swedish [[black metal]] band formed in [[Norrköping]] in 1990. The band released their debut full-length album, ''[[Dark Endless]]'', in 1992 on [[No Fashion Records]]. Their name is derived from the [[Ancient Babylonia|Ancient Babylonian]] deity, [[Marduk]].

==History==
Morgan Steinmeyer Håkansson, the band's guitarist, formed Marduk with the intention of being the "most blasphemous band in the world".<ref>{{cite web

| quote=Guitarist Morgan Håkansson formed Marduk in 1990 with the vision to create the most satanic and blasphemous band, not only from the hallowed metal grounds of Sweden, but anywhere on the globe. In fact, he has said that death and violence are most inspirational to Marduk, with a particular focus on the violence in the Bible for lyrics

Nonetheless, the stability of this line-up was ruptured following the release of ''Dark Endless'' when both Dread and Richard Kalm departed from the band. Thence, Av Gravf assumed the additional position of vocalist while Roger 'B. War' Svensson assumed the position of bass player, consequently recording their second full-length album, ''[[Those of the Unlight]]'', in April 1993, again being mixed by the aforementioned Swanö. Subsequently released on 1 October 1993, ''Those of the Unlight'' demarcated a noteworthy sonic excursion for the band, as this album manifested a more melodic black metal sound that repudiated the death metal undergirding of Marduk's body of work hitherto. The band elaborated upon this style on ''[[Opus Nocturne]]'', released on 12 December 1994, which, concerning personnel, was signified by the addition of Fredrik Andersson on drums, with Av Gravf forsaking this position to concentrate specifically on vocal delivery, and the departure of Devo.
[[File:Metalmania 2008 Marduk 03.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Marduk performing live at Metalmania, 2008]]
Stability had not yet been attained by the band, however, as Av Gravf opted to depart from Marduk in 1995, citing boredom as the primary instigator for this decision.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20160305113332/http://www.metal.de/death-metal/interview/dimension-zero/36899-dimension-zero-interview-mit-jocke-goethberg/</ref> Wherefore, Marduk recruited Erik 'Legion' Hagstedt, formerly of Swedish black metal band [[Ophthalamia]], as vocalist. This development was further characterised by the band opting to record their fourth full-length album, ''[[Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered]]'', with [[Peter Tägtgren]] of [[Hypocrisy (band)|Hypocrisy]] fame at [[The Abyss (recording studio)|The Abyss Studio]] in January 1996, antecedent to the album's release on 1 July 1996.

This line-up of the band, with the exception of Fredrik Andersson departing in 2002 only to be replaced by Emil Dragutinovic, remained largely unscathed, releasing ''[[Nightwing (album)|Nightwing]]'', ''[[Panzer Division Marduk]]'', ''[[La Grande Danse Macabre]]'', and ''[[World Funeral]]'', all of which the aforementioned Tägtgren mixed, in 1998, 1999, 2001, and 2003 respectively. Nonetheless, attributing his decision to both dissatisfaction with the band's musical direction and the diminishment of interpersonal relations within the band, Legion departed from the band in 2003, followed by B. War the subsequent year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/singer-legion-says-he-left-marduk-because-of-all-the-shit-talking/|title = Singer LEGION Says He Left MARDUK Because of All the 'Shit-Talking'|date = 19 February 2005}}</ref> Consequently, Legion was replaced by [[Daniel Rostén|Daniel 'Mortuus' Rostén]], renowned for his work within [[Funeral Mist]], while Devo returned to the band, this time assuming the position of bassist.

In September 2016, Marduk intended to tour the United States with [[Carach Angren]], [[Rotting Christ]], and [[Necronomicon (band)|Necronomicon]] but was forced to cancel this endeavour as a result of unresolved delays in acquiring visas.<ref>{{cite web

| quote=Loudwire report that the band were last week targeted by the Anti-Fascist Action Bay Area, who, in a Facebook post that has now been taken down, called them a "black metal band with known white supremacist ties from Sweden that profits off of glorifying Nazi imagery and songs about Nazi SS officers and anti-semitism." But after researching Marduk, the venue found no indications that they were "white supremacists, nationalists, or anti-immigrant" and wanted the gig to go ahead. However, after staff were reportedly threatened, and in consultation with police, it was decided the show would be scrapped.

In April 2018, Mortuus and then-drummer Fredrik Widigs were accused of purchasing items from the [[Nordic Resistance Movement]] (NMR), a Swedish [[neo-Nazi]] organization, following the publication of alleged sale records for various purchases, which included Mortuus and Widigs' real names, personal email addresses, and shipment records addressed to each member's home address.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.etc.se/nyheter/black-metal-band-avslojade-med-nmr-kopplingar|title=Black metal-band avslöjade med NMR-kopplingar|last=Söderin|first=Eigil|date=4 April 2018|work=ETC|access-date=4 April 2018|language=sv}}</ref> Marduk denied these claims on their official Facebook page stating, "No Marduk member has ordered anything from the website in question, or ever had any form of interaction with the organisation operating it. This is all we have to say about the matter."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2018/04/04/marduk-members-deny-purchasing-nazi-propaganda-tied-to-national-socialist-party/|title=Marduk Members Deny Purchasing Nazi Propaganda Tied to National Socialist Party {{!}} MetalSucks|date=4 April 2018|work=[[MetalSucks]]|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref>

Marduk released their latest studio album, ''[[Viktoria (Marduk album)|Viktoria]]'', on 22 June 2018.{{Citation needed|reason=Please provide a link|date=May 2018}} In 2019, Devo announced that he was leaving the band to focus on studio work, being replaced by Joel Lindholm in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|date=29 December 2019|title=MARDUK Bassist MAGNUS 'DEVO' ANDERSSON Quits Band To Focus On Studio Work|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/marduk-bassist-magnus-devo-andersson-quits-band-to-focus-on-studio-work/|access-date=27 August 2020|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]}}</ref>

==Musical style and lyrical themes==
The band's two initial releases, the 1991 EP, ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'', and their debut album, ''[[Dark Endless]]'', combine [[black metal]] with [[death metal]]. The band's second and third albums ''[[Those of the Unlight]]'' and ''[[Opus Nocturne]]'', showed a more melodic black metal approach, with the latter hinting at a more chaotic, blast beat-driven style that would be further explored on subsequent albums like ''[[Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered]]'', ''[[Nightwing (album)|Nightwing]]'', and ''[[Panzer Division Marduk]]''.

Concerning the thematic nature of Marduk's lyrics, the lyrics primarily incorporate [[Satanism]], [[anti-Christianity]], [[blasphemy]], [[death]], [[Third Reich]] history, and [[World War II]]. Marduk began incorporating the war themes on their 1999 album, ''[[Panzer Division Marduk]]'', which continued on in later years such as "The Hangman of Prague" on 2004's ''[[Plague Angel]]'', the title being a reference to [[Reinhard Heydrich]] — second in command of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] — in his capacity as the ''de facto'' [[Reichsprotektor]] [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|of Bohemia and Moravia]].
