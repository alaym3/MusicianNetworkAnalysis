'''Elizabeth Clark Phair''' (born April 17, 1967) is an American singer-songwriter.<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Levitt |first1=Aimee |title=How the Reader reviewed Exile in Guyville when it first came out |url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/Bleader/archives/2018/05/07/how-the-reader-reviewed-exile-in-guyville-when-it-first-came-out |magazine=[[Chicago Reader]] |date=May 7, 2018|access-date=28 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref> Born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], Phair was raised primarily in the [[Chicago]] area. After graduating from [[Oberlin College]] in 1990, she attempted to start a musical career in [[San Francisco]], California, but returned to her home in Chicago, where she began self-releasing audio cassettes under the name [[Girly Sound|Girly-Sound]]. The tapes led to a recording contract with the independent record label [[Matador Records]].

Phair's 1993 debut studio album, ''[[Exile in Guyville]]'', was released to acclaim; it has been ranked by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' as one of the [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]. Phair followed this with her second album, ''[[Whip-Smart]]'' (1994), which earned her a [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance, and ''[[Whitechocolatespaceegg]]'' (1998). Ten years after the release of her debut, Phair's fourth album, ''[[Liz Phair (album)|Liz Phair]]'' (2003), released on [[Capitol Records]], moved towards [[pop rock]], earning her a mainstream audience but alienating critics; the single "[[Why Can't I?]]" peaked at number 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Liz Phair Chart History|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/liz-phair/chart-history/hot-100|magazine=Billboard|access-date=24 May 2018}}</ref>

After the release of her fifth album, ''[[Somebody's Miracle]]'' (2005), Phair left Capitol and released her sixth album ''[[Funstyle]]'' independently in 2010. In 2018, it was announced that Matador Records would be releasing a retrospective set for Phair's debut album ''Exile in Guyville'' which includes remastered recordings from her original Girly Sound demo tapes. Phair released her seventh studio album, ''[[Soberish]]'' in 2021. As of 2011, Phair had sold over three million records worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Current|title=Liz Phair performs live in The Current Studios|author=Lucia, Mary|url=https://www.thecurrent.org/feature/2011/01/20/liz-phair-live|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|date=January 21, 2011|access-date=April 23, 2018}}</ref>

They were perfect about it ... I've never tried to find [my biological] parents. My friend who was adopted from the same home requested information and got back a four-page letter about her mother's life. She said it was jaw-dropping."<ref name=wh/>

Phair spent her early life in [[Cincinnati]] until age nine, when her family relocated to the [[Chicago]] suburb of [[Winnetka, Illinois]].{{sfn|LaBlanc|1995|p=179}} She graduated from [[New Trier High School]] in 1985.

Phair's entry into the music industry began when she met guitarist [[Chris Brokaw]], a member of the band [[Come (American band)|Come]]. Brokaw was dating one of Phair's friends, and stayed at their loft in [[SoMa]] one weekend. After living in [[San Francisco]] for a year, Phair went broke and returned to [[Chicago]], moving back in to her family's home.<ref name=kot/> There, she began writing lyrics and playing guitar, recording songs on a [[4-track recorder|four-track tape recorder]] in her bedroom.<ref name=kot>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1994-09-25-9409250127-story.html|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=September 25, 1994|title=CHICAGO SINGER LIZ PHAIR IS VOICE OF THE NOW (FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE)|last=Kot|first=Greg}}</ref> She used the name [[Girlysound|Girly Sound]] on these recordings.<ref name="smiley" /> She became part of the alternative music scene in Chicago and became friends with [[Material Issue]] and [[Urge Overkill]], two of Chicago's upstart bands to go national in the early 1990s, as well as [[Brad Wood]] and John Henderson, head of Feel Good All Over, an independent label in Chicago.<ref name="allmusic"/><!-- Interesting, but not sourced: (A later attempt at re-recording the Girly Sound tapes failed after arguments between Henderson and Phair.)-->

===1992–2003: ''Exile in Guyville''; critical recognition===
After asking Wood who the "coolest" indie label was, Phair called up [[Gerard Cosloy]], co-president of [[Matador Records]], in 1992 and she asked him if he would put out her record. Coincidentally, Cosloy had just read a review of Girly Sound in ''Chemical Imbalance'' that very day and told Phair to send him a tape. Phair sent him a tape of six Girly Sound songs. Cosloy recalls: "The songs were amazing. It was a fairly primitive recording, especially compared to the resulting album. The songs were really smart, really funny, and really harrowing, sometimes all at the same time. ... I liked it a lot and played it for everybody else. We usually don't sign people we haven't met, or heard other records by, or seen as performers. But I had a hunch, and I called her back and said O.K."

Cosloy offered a $3,000 advance, and Phair began working on a single, which turned into the 18 songs of ''[[Exile in Guyville]]''.

''Exile in Guyville'' was produced by Phair and Brad Wood, and released in 1993.<ref name="smiley">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200512/20051228.html|work=PBS|date=December 28, 2005|title=Liz Phair interview|first=Tavis|last=Smiley|author-link=Tavis Smiley|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107111750/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200512/20051228_transcript.html|archive-date=January 7, 2007|access-date=September 4, 2017}}</ref> The album received uniformly excellent reviews. The album received significant critical acclaim for its blunt, honest lyrics and for the music itself, a hybrid of [[indie rock]] and [[Lo-fi music|lo-fi]], and established Phair's penchant for exploring sexually explicit lyrics.

The release of Phair's second album received substantial media attention and an advertising blitz.  ''[[Whip-Smart]]'' debuted at #27 in 1994 and "Supernova," the first single, became a Top 10 modern rock hit, and the video was frequently featured on [[MTV]]. Phair also landed the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' with the headline "A Rock Star Is Born." The album received positive reviews, but not as acclaimed as the debut, but was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Gold]] (shipments of at least 500,000 units). It ultimately did not sell as well as expected, as it was hoped the album would introduce Phair to a wider, more mainstream audience. Following ''Whip-Smart'', Phair released ''[[Juvenilia (EP)|Juvenilia]]'', a collection of some early Girly Sound tracks and several B-sides, including her cover of the 1980 song by [[The Vapors]], "[[Turning Japanese]]."

In 1994, Phair made several live television and radio appearances in an effort to promote ''[[Exile in Guyville]]'' and ''[[Whip-Smart]]''; she appeared on ''[[Late Night With David Letterman]]'' performing "[[Never Said]]" and "Supernova", and on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' performing an acoustic version of "Whip-Smart". She also performed "Alice Springs" live on ''[[Good Morning America]]''.

She also appeared on the MTV alternative rock show ''[[120 Minutes]]'' performing "Never Said", "6'1", "Cinco de Mayo" and "Supernova" live at various times during 1994 and early 1995.

In 1995, Phair married film editor Jim Staskauskas, who had worked on her videos.  They had a son, James Nicholas Staskauskas, on December 21, 1996.<ref name="allmusic"/> Phair and Staskauskas divorced in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

Phair's third album, ''[[Whitechocolatespaceegg]]'', was released in 1998 after some delays, which included a disagreement about content; at one point, Matador rejected the album as submitted, and asked Phair to write a few additional radio-friendly songs for the set.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|location=Los Angeles, California|first=Kim|last=France|date=September 1998|title=Noise: Exile in Diaperville: What Happens When Liz Phair, Queen of One-Nighters, Finds Domestic Bliss?|volume=14|issue=9|page=78}}</ref> The album displayed a more mature Phair, and reflected some of the ways marriage and motherhood affected her. While the single "Polyester Bride" received some airplay, and the album received many positive reviews, it was no more successful commercially than her previous records.  To promote the record, Phair joined [[Lilith Fair]].  Phair performed on the main stage along with acts like [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[Missy Elliott]]. She also opened for [[Alanis Morissette]] on the her 1999 [[Junkie Tour]]. In addition, she performed the Dragon Tales theme song in 1999.{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

A note from Phair to her fans posted on her official website explained why the songs were problematic:

{{blockquote|How To Like It.

You were never supposed to hear these songs. These songs lost me my management, my record deal and a lot of nights of sleep.

Yes, I rapped one of them. Im as surprised as you are. But here is the thing you need to know about these songs and the ones coming next: These are all me. Love them, or hate them, but dont mistake them for anything other than an entirely personal, un-tethered-from-the-machine, free for all view of the world, refracted through my own crazy lens.

This is my journey. Ill keep sending you postcards.|Liz}}

Phair revealed in an interview with the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' that the falling out with her record label, ATO, occurred after a change in management. She explained, "The people who were still there didn't like, or didn't know what to do with, the music I was making, so we just stalled out and I asked to leave."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/07/13/liz-phair-why-i-left-my-record-company/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=Liz Phair: Why I Left My Record Company | first=Matt | last=Saldana | date=July 13, 2010}}</ref>

Phair went on tour to promote the album, playing many songs from ''Guyville'' and ''Whip-Smart'', along with songs from the rest of her repertoire. The Funstyle Tour ran from October 2010 to March 2011. The tour's last show took place at the [[SXSW]] festival in Austin, Texas.

In 2012, she co-wrote and performed the song "Dotted Line" with [[A. R. Rahman]] for the film ''[[People Like Us (2012 film)|People Like Us]]''. "The song 'Dotted Line' I wrote with A. R.
