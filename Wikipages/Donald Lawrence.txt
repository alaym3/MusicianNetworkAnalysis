==Biography==

===Early musical career===
Lawrence took on The Tri-City Singers after a friend vacated his position as musical director.<ref name="lawrence2000">{{cite web|title=Donald Lawrence & The Tri City Singers|url=http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/artist-articles/artists/91|publisher=GospelCity.com|date=March 22, 2000|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126040617/http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/artist-articles/artists/91|archive-date=November 26, 2005}}</ref> ('''NOTE:''' The three cities that The Tri-City Singers come from are [[Spartanburg|Spartanburg, SC]], [[Gastonia, North Carolina|Gastonia, NC]], and [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte, NC]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelflava.com/reviews/donaldlawrencerestoring.html|title=Restoring The Years|author=North, Stan|publisher=GospelFlava.com}}</ref>) The group debuted in 1993 with ''A Songwriter's Point Of View'' on a then-brand-new independent record label called [[GospoCentric Records]]. The set debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard Top Gospel Charts.<ref name="tricharts"/> The group's follow-up release ''Bible Stories'' would top those same charts when it arrived in 1995.<ref name="donaldalbums">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p155985|label=Donald Lawrence: Billboard Albums Chart History}}</ref> It was the first to be billed as Donald Lawrence & The Tri-City Singers and featured black church-ubiquitous hits such as "A Message For The Saints", "I Am God" and "Stranger". The album was released on Lawrence's newly minted label Crystal Rose Records which was distributed through [[Sparrow Records]].

In 1997, Donald Lawrence produced the live portion of [[Karen Clark Sheard]]'s Grammy-nominated ''Finally Karen'' debut. Lawrence & Tri-City also released the seasonal ''Hello Christmas'' the same year. Later, Lawrence signed a contract with the Island Records imprint [[Island Records|Island Inspirational]]. Though a live recording did take place for release,<ref name="lawrence2000"/> the album never materialized.

In 2000, Donald Lawrence & The Tri-City Singers signed to EMI Gospel. To promote the new album, a maxi CD of the lead single "Testify" to the mainstream. [[house music|House]] [[remix]]es by [[Junior Vasquez]] sent the song to No. 33 on Billboard's Mainstream Dance Charts.<ref name="donaldcharts">{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p155985|label=Donald Lawrence: Billboard Singles Chart History}}</ref> When ''tri-city4.com'' was finally released in late summer 2000, the set peaked at #2 on Billboard's Top Gospel Charts and #13 on Billboard's Heatseekers Charts.<ref name="tricharts">{{cite web|url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p407014|pure_url=yes}}|title=Tri City Singers Charts & Awards|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref> The album also got a profile boost from the all-star standout "God's Favor", featuring vocal turns from Karen Clark Sheard, [[Kim Burrell]], and [[Kelly Price]].

Lawrence waited almost two years before delivering the follow-up ''Go Get Your Life Back'' in early 2002. "[[The Best Is Yet to Come (Donald Lawrence song)|The Best Is Yet to Come]]", a song sonically much in the vein of the previous smash "Testify," was chosen as the album's lead single. This release featured guest appearances from [[Ann Nesby]] (formerly of [[Sounds of Blackness]]) and gospel pioneer [[Bishop Walter Hawkins]]. The momentum continued with the 2003 release of ''Restoring The Years'', a greatest hits album featuring two new songs.

The next album would mark a fresh start for Donald Lawrence. ''I Speak Life'' was his first solo album, the debut for his newly inked recording contract with Verity Records, and also the first release under his new sublabel Quiet Water Entertainment. Though the album was without The Tri-City Singers, guest appearances were plenteous. [[Donnie McClurkin]], [[Hezekiah Walker]], [[Faith Evans]], [[Richard Smallwood]], and [[Carl Thomas (singer)|Carl Thomas]] all contributed to the album. Even jazz notables [[Ramsey Lewis]] and [[Lalah Hathaway]] were on hand for a remake of the ''Bible Stories'' classic "Don't Forget To Remember". The effort earned Lawrence a total of 7 [[Stellar Award]] nominations, and 6 wins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelflava.com/stellar/stellarresults-2006.html|title=The Official 21st Annual Stellar Award Winners (2006)|publisher=GospelFlava.com}}

In March 2006, The Tri-City Singers announced that they would retire, but not before one last live recording.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/music-articles/new_music/269|title=Donald Lawrence and the Tri-City Singers Bid Farewell With the Release Of "Finale"|date=March 14, 2006|publisher=GospelCity.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212004533/http://www.gospelcity.com/dynamic/music-articles/new_music/269/|archive-date=December 12, 2006}}</ref> ''Finale: Act One'' and ''Finale: Act Two'' were released simultaneously on April 4, 2006. Each release was a CD/DVD set that chronicled the audio and video of one half of the concert, with packages that locked into one another respectively. A special edition of ''Finale'' was later released with both CDs and DVDs. The blowout concert included guest appearances from [[Walter Hawkins|Bishop Walter Hawkins]], [[Karen Clark Sheard]], [[Vanessa Bell Armstrong]], [[Daryl Coley]], [[LaShun Pace]], [[Darwin Hobbs]], and many other gospel luminaries. The album's lead single "The Blessing Of Abraham" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award]] for Best Gospel Performance in December 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/49th_Show/list.aspx#11|title=49th Annual Grammy Award Nominees List: Gospel Categories|publisher=Grammy.org}}</ref> His sophomore solo album, ''The Law of Confession Part I'' was released in February 2009.  Donald said in an interview that ''The Law of Confession, Part II'' will be released soon, but he's focusing on other projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/gospelrama/2009/02/gospel_5.html|title=Donald Lawrence says there's power in confession}}</ref>
