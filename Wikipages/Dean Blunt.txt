'''Roy Nnawuchi''', better known by his pseudonym '''Dean Blunt''', is a British singer-songwriter and musician. He is best known for his solo work and his work as part of [[avant-garde]] duo [[Hype Williams (band)|Hype Williams]] (along with [[Inga Copeland]]), and more recently, the groups Babyfather and Blue Iverson. Blunt was also the founder of London rock band Graffiti Island.<ref name="allmusic-bio">{{cite web |url= http://www.allmusic.com/artist/dean-blunt-mn0002793874/biography |title= Dean Blunt |publisher= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= 22 February 2016 |author= Kellman, Andy}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/apr/05/hype-williams-speak-the-truth |title= Hype Williams: do they ever speak the truth? |work= [[The Guardian]] |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate= 22 February 2016 |author= Beaumont-Thomas, Ben}}</ref> He has been described as "a prolific, category-rejecting artist"<ref name="allmusic-bio" /> and "an [[art-pop]] provocateur."<ref name="spin">{{cite web |url= http://www.spin.com/2015/10/dean-blunt-archangel-julia-remix/ |title =Dean Blunt Goes on a Trip for 'On Wine, Hashish & Molly' Version of Archangel's 'Julia' |work= [[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date= 20 October 2015 |accessdate= 22 February 2016 |author= Joyce, Colin}}</ref>

== Life and career ==
Although little is known about his personal life, Blunt has said he comes from a [[London]] family that he describes as "[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|Sun]] readers, working class, kind of ignorant in ways".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thewire.co.uk/in-writing/interviews/hype-williams-transcript|title=Hype Williams transcript - The Wire|first=Lisa|last=Blanning|website=The Wire Magazine - Adventures In Modern Music}}</ref> 

Blunt performed music with Russian-born artist [[Inga Copeland]] (also known as Lolina) as the electronic duo [[Hype Williams (band)|Hype Williams]] from 2007 until 2012. Supposedly founded in 2005 as a "relay" project passed between artists every five years, the group has given few interviews, leaving music journalists and the media in doubt as to the exact nature of the project.<ref name="fact">{{cite web|title=FACT mix 216: Hype Williams|url=http://www.factmag.com/2011/01/24/35724/|website=[[Fact (UK magazine)|Fact]]|date=24 January 2011|accessdate=20 July 2016}}</ref><ref name="quietus"/> The group's lineup has remained obscure, although Blunt's artistic style has been heard within newer releases, and a variety of other names have also been invoked as members. A mysterious representative named Denna Frances Glass has alternately been posited as either the manager of the project or a fake identity created by Blunt and Copeland.<ref name="fact"/><ref name="quietus">{{cite web|last1=Gibb|first1=Rory|title=In Search of Hype Williams|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/06600-hype-williams-interview|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=21 July 2016}}</ref> In 2016, Glass announced that Blunt and Copeland were no longer part of the project, which would be continuing with other members.<ref name="bv">{{cite web|last1=Brito|first1=Kristian|title=Hype Williams' new album out now; Dean Blunt & Inga Copeland touring separately |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/hype-williams-new-album-out-now-dean-blunt-inga-copeland-touring-separately/ |website=[[Brooklyn Vegan]]|accessdate=17 August 2016}}</ref>

Blunt embarked his solo career in 2011, releasing a set of albums as well as several EPs and singles. His first few full-length studio albums, ''The Narcissist II'' (2012), ''[[The Redeemer (album)|The Redeemer]]'' (2013), and ''[[Black Metal (Dean Blunt album)|Black Metal]]'' (2014), received attention and praise from various music publications.<ref name="allmusic-bio"/><ref>{{cite web |last=Milton |first=Jamie |date= 6 November 2014 |url= http://diymag.com/2014/11/06/dean-blunt-black-metal-album-review |title= Dean Blunt – Black Metal |work= [[DIY (magazine)|DIY]] |accessdate= 1 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last= Joyce |first= Colin |date= 17 November 2014 |url= http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/20012-dean-blunt-black-metal/ |title= Dean Blunt: Black Metal |work=Pitchfork|accessdate= 1 January 2015}}</ref> ''BBF Hosted By DJ Escrow,'' his first album as Babyfather, was named the best album of 2016 by ''[[Tiny Mix Tapes]]'' and ''[[Resident Advisor]]''.

In 2018, Blunt contributed heavily to [[A$AP Rocky|ASAP Rocky]]'s album ''[[Testing (album)|Testing]]'', with production and writing credits on "Purity" and "Gunz N Butter" and additional vocals on "Calldrops". Blunt's work on the album followed collaborative singles between the two artists prior, such as the Babyfather track "Benzo Amore".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ra.co/news/41826|title=Dean Blunt appears on three tracks from A$AP Rocky's new album, Testing · News ⟋ RA|website=Resident Advisor}}</ref> The pair have since collaborated on multiple recordings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://floodmagazine.com/86912/listen-dean-blunt-asap-rocky-stoozy/|title=Dean Blunt and A$AP Rocky Collaboration “Stoozy” Surfaces Online|website=FLOOD}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/09/10/asap-rocky-yung-lean-appear-on-dean-blunt-new-album|title=A$AP Rocky and Yung Lean appear on Dean Blunt’s new album|website=The FADER}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/dean-blunt-drops-new-ep-featuring-asap-rocky-and-mica-levi-listen/|title=Dean Blunt Drops New EP Featuring ASAP Rocky and Mica Levi: Listen|first=Condé|last=Nast|date=19 September 2018|website=Pitchfork}}</ref>

Blunt is also known for his playfulness and obfuscation. In 2015, he sent his bodyguard to accept his Philip Hall Radar Award at the [[NME Awards]].<ref name=Noisey>{{cite web |url=https://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/article/ryzg9m/dean-blunt-pranked-the-nme-awards-last-night |title=Dean Blunt Pranked the NME Awards Last Night – Noisey |first=Joe |last=Zadeh |work=Vice |date=19 February 2015 |accessdate= 8 November 2017}}</ref> In 2016, he listed a toy [[Foxtons]] estate agents Mini Cooper filled with marijuana on [[eBay]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitchfork.com/news/62918-dean-blunt-is-selling-a-toy-car-stuffed-with-weed-on-ebay/|title=Dean Blunt Is Selling a Toy Car Stuffed With Weed on eBay |first=Jazz|last=Monroe|work= Pitchfork|date=14 January 2016|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref> At a New York concert, in March 2016, media guests were asked to check in under aliases that they had received with their ticket confirmations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/19/dean-blunts-agit-rap|title=Dean Blunt's Agit Rap|first=Matthew| last=Trammell|work=[[The New Yorker (magazine)|The New Yorker]]|date=19 September 2016|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>
