'''Clipping''' (stylized as '''clipping.''') is an American [[experimental hip hop]] group from Los Angeles, California. The group consists of rapper [[Daveed Diggs]] and producers William Hutson and Jonathan Snipes.<ref name="graun"/>

==History==
Diggs and Hutson met in grade school, and Hutson and Snipes were college roommates.<ref name="spin">{{cite web |url=https://www.spin.com/2014/01/clipping-interview-noise-rap-sub-pop-midcity/ |title=Clipping: Los Angeles Noise-Rap Crew Crank Out Scientifically Ugly Party Jams |last=Sherburne |first=Philip |author-link=Philip Sherburne |date=January 7, 2014 |website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |access-date=May 2, 2014 |archive-date=July 8, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150708222953/http://www.spin.com/2014/01/clipping-interview-noise-rap-sub-pop-midcity/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The group began in 2009 as a remix project, with Hutson and Snipes taking [[a cappella]]s of mainstream rap artists and making [[power electronics (music)|power electronics]] and noise [[remix]]es of them to amuse themselves. Diggs joined in 2010 and began to write his own raps over their compositions.<ref name="subpop"/> They self-released their first album, ''[[midcity (album)|midcity]]'', on their website on February 5, 2013.<ref name="bandcamp">{{cite web |url=http://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/midcity |title=midcity – clipping |publisher=[[Bandcamp]] |access-date=May 5, 2014 |archive-date=April 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140403104320/http://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/midcity |url-status=live }}</ref> Though their expectations were low, and despite minimal promotion, the album was well-received, and five months later, they signed to [[Sub Pop]]. Their second album, ''[[CLPPNG]]'', was released on June 10, 2014.<ref name="subpop"/>

The group does not see their abrasive sound as a rejection of mainstream hip hop or reaction against it, but as part of a hip hop tradition, including the likes of [[Dr. Dre]] and [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] producers [[The Bomb Squad]], who experimented with production and also used harsh, [[musique concrète]]-esque techniques in their music. Similarly, they think of themselves as a rap group rather than [[industrial (music)|industrial]]-rap, noise-rap, or other mash-up genres.<ref name="subpop"/>

On June 14, 2016, they released an EP, ''[[Wriggle (EP)|Wriggle]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/wriggle |title=Wriggle &#124; clipping |website=Clppng.bandcamp.com |access-date=November 8, 2016 |archive-date=October 17, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161017202202/https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/wriggle |url-status=live }}</ref> They then released their second studio album, ''[[Splendor & Misery]]'', later on September 9.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/splendor-misery |title=Splendor & Misery &#124; clipping |website=Clppng.bandcamp.com |access-date=November 8, 2016 |archive-date=November 4, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104163642/http://clppng.bandcamp.com/album/splendor-misery |url-status=live }}</ref> A science fiction [[concept album]], ''Splendor & Misery'' was nominated for the 2017 [[Hugo Award]]s in the category of "[[Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form|Best Dramatic Presentation (Short Form)]]" on April 4, 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tor.com/2017/04/04/2017-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |title=2017 Hugo Awards Finalists Announced |website=[[Tor.com]] |date=April 4, 2017 |access-date=April 7, 2017 |archive-date=April 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408081932/http://www.tor.com/2017/04/04/2017-hugo-award-finalists-announced/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

On August 14, 2019, the group released a lyric video to YouTube for a new song titled "Nothing Is Safe", which borrowed heavily from the aesthetics of 1970s and '80s horror films like ''[[Halloween (1978 film)|Halloween]]'' and the soundtrack works of [[John Carpenter]]. This was coupled with the announcement that their third full-length record, ''[[There Existed an Addiction to Blood]]'', would be released on October 18 of the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIrpLBShe1A |title=CLIPPING – Nothing Is Safe (Lyric Video) |via=YouTube |date=August 14, 2019 |access-date=August 14, 2019 |archive-date=August 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814214252/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIrpLBShe1A |url-status=live }}</ref>

"Chapter 319" was recorded during the [[George Floyd protests|protests]] after the [[murder of George Floyd]], while "Knees on the Ground" was originally recorded after the [[shooting of Michael Brown]] in 2014.

As part of their experimental style, the band adhere to certain stylistic limitations. Their instrumentation is derived from real world samples (e.g. using recordings of bottles being hit or bricks breaking) instead of traditional instruments. Similarly, Diggs writes his rap in second person, all 'I, me' language is off limits.<ref>{{Cite web|last=hrishikesh|date=2016-02-18|title=Episode 65: Clipping|url=https://songexploder.net/clipping|access-date=2021-04-19|website=Song Exploder|language=en-US}}</ref>
