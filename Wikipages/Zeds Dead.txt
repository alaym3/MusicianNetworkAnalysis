==Career==
Mamid and Rapp-Rovan were born and raised in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]]. The duo were introduced through mutual friends in 2004 when DC asked Hooks to paint a graffiti mural in his garage. They quickly discovered a mutual love for hip-hop and at the same time were both starting to produce music. They began to collaborate under the moniker 'Mass Productions'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elektrodaily.com/zeds-dead-interview/ |title=Exclusive Interview with Zeds Dead |publisher=Webcache.googleusercontent.com |access-date=2016-04-05 |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151008122303/http://elektrodaily.com/zeds-dead-interview/ |archive-date=2015-10-08 }}</ref>  The duo's name comes from a line in the [[Quentin Tarantino]] film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/music/q-and-a-hooks-from-zeds-dead-talks-pulp-fiction-defining-dubstep-and-playing-dallas-for-the-first-time-7054253|title=Q & A: Hooks from Zeds Dead Talks Pulp Fiction, Defining Dubstep and Playing Dallas for the First Time.|last=Smyers|first=Darryl|date=2011-11-15|work=Dallas Observer|access-date=2017-05-24}}</ref>

===Mass Productions (2006–2007)===
In the summer of 2007 Mass Productions independently released their first and only official release. The album was heavily influenced by 1990s hip hop.<ref name="browardpalmbeach1">{{cite web|last=Freyman |first=Falyn |url=http://www.browardpalmbeach.com/music/zeds-deads-hooks-on-their-early-days-we-made-our-own-scene-6420290 |title=Zeds Dead's Hooks on Their Early Days: "We Made Our Own Scene" &#124; New Times Broward-Palm Beach |publisher=Browardpalmbeach.com |date=2013-08-02 |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref>
However, Mass Productions did not garner much attention outside of the local scene.

===Formation of Zeds Dead (2009–2010)===
DC and Hooks both began to take an interest in electronic music, and began producing dance music under the name Zeds Dead. The group initially found a niche audience on [[Myspace]].

Zeds Dead self-released their first track together, "Journey of a Lifetime", for free.<ref>{{cite web|author=Biography by Andy Kellman |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/zeds-dead-mn0002815836/biography |title=Zeds Dead &#124; Biography & History |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> They played their first live set at The Social in Toronto on June 11, 2009.

===Bassmentality (2009–2013)===
In 2009 Zeds Dead founded a weekly party called Bassmentality in the basement of the Toronto bar 751. The party was intended as a venue for new [[Disc jockey|DJs]] to play, unrestricted by concert promoters. In the summer of 2010 Bassmentality moved from the basement of 751 and into Toronto's Wrongbar.<ref name="browardpalmbeach1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogto.com/music/2011/12/get_to_know_a_dj_zeds_dead/ |title=Get to know a DJ: Zeds Dead |publisher=Blogto.com |date=2011-12-27 |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref>

Bassmentality featured weekly performances from its founders, Zeds Dead and The Killabits, as well as rotating slots of local and international acts. Over the four years that the event existed, it hosted early performances from several now-acclaimed artists such as [[Skrillex]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BASSMENTALITY/photos/a.176871199013320.45414.176871115679995/240853532615086/?type=3&theater |title=Bassmentality - Bassmentality added a new photo. |publisher=Facebook |date=2011-08-07 |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> [[Borgore]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BASSMENTALITY/photos/a.176871199013320.45414.176871115679995/480614055305698/?type=3&theater |title=Bassmentality - Bassmentality + Embrace PRESENT:... |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-10-11 |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> [[Nero (band)|Nero]], [[Camo & Krooked]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BASSMENTALITY/photos/a.176871199013320.45414.176871115679995/421466831220421/?type=3&theater |title=Bassmentality - Bassmentality added a new photo. |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-05-31 |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> Bare Noize,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/BASSMENTALITY/photos/a.176871199013320.45414.176871115679995/444350598932044/?type=3&theater |title=Bassmentality - Bassmentality added a new photo. |publisher=Facebook |date=2012-07-12 |access-date=2016-04-05}}</ref> and Bar 9, among others.
