'''Puya''' is a Puerto Rican [[progressive metal]] band. Formed in 1991, the band rose to prominence with their fusion of [[jazz]], [[salsa music|salsa]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]].

==History==

The band originally formed in [[Puerto Rico]] as a [[progressive rock]] combo,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.questia.com/article/1G1-77810705/puya|title="Puya" by Gore, Joe - Guitar Player, Vol. 35, Issue 10, October 2001 |website=|accessdate=}}{{dl|date=July 2021}}</ref> in 1991, under the name Whisker Biscuit.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9gsEAAAAMBAJ|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1996-05-04|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> In 1992, the band added vocalist [[Sergio Curbelo]] and moved to [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]], where they created a mix of [[Salsa music|salsa]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] with the assistance of Jeff Renza and the Noiz Boiz production studio. They adopted the name Puya in 1994, which is Spanish for "sharp point",<ref name="LatinMusic"/> but is also a popular type of Puerto Rican coffee.<ref name="billboard">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9gsEAAAAMBAJ|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9gsEAAAAMBAJ/page/n47 48]|title=Billboard|last=Inc|first=Nielsen Business Media|date=1996-05-04|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> Puya was the first Puerto Rican rock band to achieve a high level of international success.<ref name="Mateus">{{cite book |last1=Mateus |first1=Jorge Arévalo |editor1-first=Deborah Pacini |editor1-last=Hernandez |others=D.

In 1995, Puya released their self-titled debut album under the Noiz Boiz label, but did not sign with the label.<ref name=billboard/> There they also met producer [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] who signed them to [[Music Corporation of America|MCA]] and in 1999 released their second album, ''[[Fundamental (Puya album)|Fundamental]]'', which received critical praise. This propelled the band to stardom even landing them in the second stage of [[Ozzfest]] where they shared the opening slot with [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]] in 1999. In 2000, their song "Tírale" was included in the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Heavy Metal 2000]]'', and was the collection's only track with Spanish lyrics. The band opened for [[Sepultura]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], [[Pantera]] and [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]]. They also recorded a cover of [[The Police]]'s "[[Spirits in the Material World]]" in Spanish, with the title "Almas en un mundo material". 

When sales of the band's 2001 album ''[[Union (Puya album)|Union]]'' did not meet MCA's expectations, the label did not renew the band's contract.<ref name="Mateus"/> After a 2002 performance at Tito Puente Amphitheater in Puerto Rico (which was later released on DVD), Puya went on an extended hiatus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.puyaonline.com/bio/|title=BIO - Puya}}</ref> During this time Ramon Ortiz formed the band [[Ankla]].

In 2009, Puya reunited and performed in front of over 12,000 fans at Stereo Music Fest at the Puerto Rico Convention Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/puya-to-release-areyto-ep-next-week/|title=PUYA To Release 'Areyto' EP Next Week}}</ref> The digital EP ''Areyto'' appeared on iTunes on August 27, 2010. The band has since continued on with a lighter touring schedule, focusing primarily on "special shows" like Cuba’s Patria Grande Festival in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.puyaonline.com/bio/|title=BIO - Puya}}</ref>

In 2018, Sergio Curbelo left the band. Diego Romero of Trujillo Alto, Puerto Rico, replaced him<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ghostcultmag.com/puya-to-perform-with-new-singer-tomorrow-at-viva-la-rock-fest/|title=Puya To Perform With New Singer Tomorrow At Viva La Rock Fest}}</ref> and they released two singles together, "Subelle La Candela" whose lyrics speak about the protests held in Puerto Rico against former governor [[Ricardo Rosselló]] and "Viento". In 2020, Puya announced that Diego was embarking upon a solo career and Sergio is returning to the band. Puya entered the studio in the summer of 2020 and teased a new song "Potencial" on the Puerto Rican digital radio station AZ Rock Radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1395238100661871&id=224857267699966|title=Facebook - PUYA · PUYA FANS!}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ghostcultmag.com/puya-shares-new-single-potencial-on-puerto-ricos-az-radio/|title=Puya Shares New Single “Potencial” on Puerto Rico’s AZ Radio}}</ref>

==Musical style and influences==
Puya's music is defined by placing emphasis on heavy guitar grooves and percussive Latin rhythms, punctuated by [[big band]] horns, with composed melodies that lead into instrumental improvisation. Additionally, some of Puya's songs have also incorporated [[rapping]].<ref name=allmusic/><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kioEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA87|title=CMJ New Music Monthly|last=Inc|first=CMJ Network|date=2017-02-01|publisher=CMJ Network, Inc.|language=en}}</ref> Puya's music draws from diverse styles, including [[salsa music|salsa]],<ref name=bouley>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12 |title=MCA's Puya Gets 'Fundamental' With Mix Of Rock, Salsa| author=Charles R.
