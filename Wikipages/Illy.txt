'''Illycaffè S.p.A.''' (branded and stylised as '''illy''') is an Italian coffee company specializing in [[espresso]], headquartered in [[Trieste]]. Illy markets its coffee globally in silver and red pressurized, oxygen-free cans; operates a network of cafes on shopping streets, in museums, and in airports; and, since 2009, has marketed a line of coffee-flavored energy drinks as ''illy issimo''.

Either as whole beans or ground coffee, Illy offers medium, dark, and decaffeinated roast variations; as well as single-origin [[Coffea arabica|arabica]] variations, as available; each from Brazil, Guatemala, Ethiopia, Colombia, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Tanzania or India. Seasonally, the company offers Idillyum, a low-caffeine arabica grown in El Salvador. The company packages coffee as whole beans, pre-ground coffee, [[Easy Serving Espresso Pod|ESE pods]], and [[iperEspresso]] capsules.

Illy was founded in 1933 by [[Francesco Illy]], remains family-controlled and employs about 2700+ employees (2015). 2016 revenues totalled €460 million,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://valuereport.illy.com/pdf/BILANCIO_illy_IDENTITA_EN.pdf|title=Illy Annual Report|access-date=14 March 2018}}</ref> and in late 2019, Illycaffee sought to expand into the United States market, offering a 20% stake in the company to potential investors.<ref name="ref5">{{cite web

==History==
[[File:Illy Ferenc.jpg|thumb|[[Francesco Illy]] (Illy Ferenc), the company's founder, in 1930]]

Illy was founded by [[Francesco Illy]] (Illy Ferenc in Hungarian), born in [[Temesvár]] in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austria-Hungary Empire]], what is now [[Timișoara]], [[Romania]].  Illy later moved to [[Trieste]] during World War I as an officer in the army. After the war, he remained in Trieste, which had recently come under Italian rule, and in 1933 set up a [[cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]] business, eventually concentrating on coffee.<ref name="Fortune">{{citation|author=Nicholas Stein|author2=Doris Burke|title=Crisis in a coffee cup|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150112212629/http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/12/09/333463/index.htm|archive-date=12 January 2015|magazine=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]|date=9 December 2002}}.</ref> Focusing his interest on [[espresso]], in 1935, Illy invented the first automatic coffee machine which substituted compressed air for steam, marketed as the ''illetta'', the predecessor of contemporary espresso machines.<ref>{{citation|author=John Tagliabue|title=Coffeehouses as fashion boutiques; selling cachet by the cup|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/business/worldbusiness/26eurocoffee.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206190839/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/business/worldbusiness/26eurocoffee.html|archive-date=6 December 2014|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=26 December 2006}}.</ref>

Illy developed a packaging system to preserve coffee, where coffee-filled cans are pressurized with nitrogen, to prevent oxidation. Illy coffee was soon marketed outside the Trieste area and was eventually marketed throughout Italy.

After World War II, control of the company passed to [[Ernesto Illy]] (1925–2008), the son of the founder, who started a research laboratory that would ultimately develop numerous inventions and patents. As a scientist and researcher, Ernesto Illy established cooperative agreements with universities and research centers and promoted coffee globally.<ref>{{citation|author=Dennis Hevesi|title=Ernesto Illy, chairman of coffee company, is dead at 82|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/europe/06illy.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224002836/http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/06/world/europe/06illy.html|archive-date=24 February 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=6 February 2008}}.</ref>

Ernesto's son [[Andrea Illy]] is currently the company chairman, and Andrea's sister Anna Illy and brothers Francesco Illy and [[Riccardo Illy]] are on the board of directors.<ref name="Fortune"/> Illy coffee is available globally, with price differences reflecting global [[tariff]]s.

Illycaffè S.p.A. markets coffee-related products in approximately 140 countries worldwide. The Illy Group is made up of several companies located in North America, France, Germany, Spain and [[Benelux]]. The group employs approximately 800 people in these locations.

Since the end of the 1980s, illy has purchased its green (raw) coffee beans directly from source countries, rather than the international commodities markets. The company exclusively purchases coffee of the [[Coffea arabica|arabica]] species, in particular from Brazil, the largest producer worldwide, but also from Colombia, India, and countries in Africa and Central America. Illy's ''Università del caffè'' ("University of Coffee") offers free training for growers. In Brazil, a nine-month program (one week per month) includes 360 hours of lectures. Illy buys between 10% and 30% of coffee produced by growers trained at the University of Coffee at a premium price, but does not require that the growers enter into an exclusive contract with the company.<ref>{{citation|author=Ariel Schwartz|title=Why illycaffe doesn't sell fair trade coffee|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1706189/why-andrea-illy-doesnt-sell-fair-trade-coffee|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707101546/http://www.fastcompany.com/1706189/why-andrea-illy-doesnt-sell-fair-trade-coffee|archive-date=7 July 2012|work=[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]|date=30 November 2010}}.</ref>

Illy was the world's first company to receive the Responsible Supply Chain Process (RSCP) certification of sustainability awarded by the [[Det Norske Veritas]] (DNV).<ref>{{citation|title=The Story behind a Cup of Coffee &#91;Forum No. 2 2011&#93;|url=http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2011/forum_2_2011/thestorybehindacupofcoffee.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929043843/http://www.dnv.com/resources/publications/dnv_forum/2011/forum_2_2011/thestorybehindacupofcoffee.asp|archive-date=29 September 2013|publisher=[[Det Norske Veritas]]|date=22 May 2011}}; {{citation|title=Illy is the world's first coffee with DNV sustainability certification|url=http://www.espressocasa.co.nz/site/sustainability.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929044824/http://www.espressocasa.co.nz/site/sustainability.php|archive-date=29 September 2013|publisher=Espressocasa.co.nz|access-date=29 September 2013}}.</ref>

From 2004 to 2012, illycaffè funded the Ernesto Illy Trieste Science Prize to recognize scientific researchers from the developing world, in collaboration with The World Academy of Sciences ([[TWAS]]).<ref>{{citation|title=The Ernesto Illy Trieste Science Prize (2005–2008, 2009–2012)|url=http://twas.ictp.it/prog/prizes/trieste-science-prize|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204003127/http://twas.ictp.it/prog/prizes/trieste-science-prize|archive-date=4 December 2013|publisher=The World Academy of Sciences ([[TWAS]])|access-date=4 December 2013}}.</ref> Illy was featured in the 2006 documentary ''[[Black Gold (2006 film)|Black Gold]]'', in reference to its marketing of coffee from [[Ethiopia]].

In an interview with [[The Wall Street Journal]] in June 2021, chairman Andrea Illy expressed interest in expanding the company's presence in the United States, the largest coffee market in the world. He noted branding as one of the main focuses in breaking into the market, as well as strengthening the company's distribution network both online and in larger retailers such as hotels, restaurants, and cafes.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Sylvers|first=Eric|date=2021-06-12|title=Italy’s Illycaffè Sets Its Sights on the U.S. Coffee Market|language=en-US|work=Wall Street Journal|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/italys-illycaffe-sets-its-sights-on-the-u-s-coffee-market-11623520372|access-date=2021-07-01|issn=0099-9660}}</ref>

==Coffee and energy drinks==
[[File:Tazzina di caffè a Ventimiglia.jpg|thumb]]

Illy coffees are blended from arabica beans from multiple sources. The grounds are packaged in steel canisters and pressurized with an inert gas rather than air.

On 22 May 2009, in partnership with [[The Coca-Cola Company]], illy launched a line of coffee-flavoured energy drinks marketed as ''illy issimo''. In 2009, [[AirTran Airways]] began serving the beverage to passengers, which has since been available in five flavors: caffè, caffè no sugar, [[cappuccino]], [[latte macchiato]], and [[caffè mocha|mochaccino]].<ref>{{citation|title=Illy issimo gives coffee lovers two new tastes of lower calorie decadence anytime, anywhere: Italy's favorite on-the-go coffee drink announces caffè no sugar and mochaccino flavors &#91;press release&#93;|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110516006794/en/illy-issimo-Coffee-Lovers-Tastes-Calorie-Decadence|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819113239/http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20110516006794/en/illy-issimo-Coffee-Lovers-Tastes-Calorie-Decadence|archive-date=19 August 2011|publisher=[[BusinessWire]]|date=16 May 2011}}.</ref>
