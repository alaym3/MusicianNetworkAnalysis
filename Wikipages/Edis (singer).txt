== Artistry ==
Edis can play guitar and piano but does not consider himself a professional instrumentalist.<ref name="apart">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.aparatmag.com/edis|title=Edis|magazine=Aparat Mag|issue=4|date=June 2015|accessdate=3 June 2015|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20150603090120/http://www.aparatmag.com/edis|archivedate=3 June 2015}}</ref> His first single "Benim Ol" is said to have classical elements, and Onur Baştürk of ''Hürriyet'' considers it similar to the songs of 1990s.<ref name="dadi"/><ref name="yeni"/> Edis wrote his first song at the age of ten "just to attract interest". As he grew older he worked on the lyrics again and considers his attempts to write a song successful.<ref name="apart"/> He is a fan of [[Freddie Mercury]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Sezen Aksu]] and [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]]. During his childhood he mostly listened to [[Barış Manço]], [[Britney Spears]] and [[Justin Timberlake]]. After listening to [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]'s "[[Desert Rose (Sting song)|Desert Rose]]" he decided to include elements of both Western and Eastern music in his work.<ref name="dadi"/>

In terms of fashion, Edis sees himself as a bit prejudiced and chooses famous brands more often. He thinks a lot about his style and cares about looking good.<ref name="apart"/>
