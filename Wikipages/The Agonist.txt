Vocalist Alissa White-Gluz appeared in March on [[Blackguard (band)|Blackguard's]] album [[Profugus Mortis (album)|Profugus Mortis]] on the song "The Sword" and then again as a "hottest chick in metal" in the May 2009 issue of ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.revolvermag-digital.com/revolver/200905/ |title=Revolver – May2009 |publisher=Revolvermag-digital.com |access-date=March 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715180115/http://www.revolvermag-digital.com/revolver/200905/ |archive-date=July 15, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

While touring ''Lullabies for the Dormant Mind'', the Agonist made their first trips to Mexico, Venezuela, Japan, China, Colombia, and toured Europe.

===''Prisoners'' (2011–2013)===
{{Main article|Prisoners (album)}}
In late 2011, the Agonist took part in the "Pandemonium over North America" tour with [[Kamelot]], [[Alestorm]] and [[Blackguard (band)|Blackguard]] (except Guitarist Danny Marino, who was unable to tour with the band and was replaced by ex-Catalyst guitarist Justin Deguire). While on tour, the band sold an EP entitled ''The Escape'' which showcased two tracks scheduled to appear on the band's third full-length album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162450|title=TH AGONIST To Release 'The Escape' EP – Aug. 25, 2011|publisher=blabbermouth.net|date=August 15, 2011|access-date=August 26, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629213044/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=162450|archive-date=June 29, 2012}}</ref> It was [[Audio mixing (recorded music)|mixed]] by [[Tue Madsen]] who is known for his work with [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|the Haunted]], [[Dark Tranquillity]] and [[Suicide Silence]].  ''The Escape'' was later made available on iTunes and through pre-order from CM Distro from September 3.

Vocalist Alissa White-Gluz told metalconcerts.net that the band's music has become more mature, not necessarily heavier or more melodic. She elaborated by saying there are more "classic" influences like [[Pantera]] and [[Radiohead]].<ref name="blabbermouth.net"/> She told Lithium Magazine that the record could be good for someone with an open mind musical taste, or bad for someone who only likes ''Thank You, Pain''. The album's final recording processes took place following the conclusion of the Kamelot tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lithiummagazine.com/interview-alissa-white-gluz-agonist-august-14th-2011|title=Interview with Alissa White-Gluz of The Agonist – August 14th,2011|last=Bax|first=Mike|date=August 23, 2011|access-date=August 26, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105050016/http://lithiummagazine.com/interview-alissa-white-gluz-agonist-august-14th-2011|archive-date=November 5, 2011}}</ref>

==Style==
The Agonist are known primarily for Vicky Psarakis' and Alissa White-Gluz's ability to use both clean vocals and metal growls and Danny Marino's use of two or more intersecting melodies and unorthodox chords often featuring wide intervals and octave displacements. Songs' themes often revolve around moral concerns such as [[animal rights]], societal dilemmas, and the state of the world.<ref>[http://ecard.centurymedia.com/theagonist/ Century Media Records – The Agonist] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009022510/http://ecard.centurymedia.com/theagonist/ |date=October 9, 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid1=114&csid2=846&fid1=27160|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120703162952/http://www.exclaim.ca/musicreviews/generalreview.aspx?csid1=114&csid2=846&fid1=27160|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 3, 2012|title=The Agonist – Once Only Imagined|last=Whish|first=Bill|date=September 2007|work=Exclaim|access-date=November 14, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=bravewords.com |url=http://www.bravewords.com/news/76060 |title=> News > THE AGONIST Guitarist DANNY MARINO – "I Come From A Very Musical Family; My Uncle FRANK MARINO Has Been A Touring National Act For The Past 30 Years" |publisher=Bravewords.com |access-date=March 3, 2011}}</ref>
