'''Issues''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band based in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], founded in 2012. The band currently consists of guitarist and vocalist AJ Rebollo, bassist and vocalist Skyler Acord, and drummer Josh Manuel.

Following original member Michael Bohn and [[Tyler Carter]]'s departure from [[Woe, Is Me]], the duo formed Issues with keyboardist Ben Ferris, bassist Cory Ferris, guitarist AJ Rebollo, and drummer Case Snedecor, subsequently signing to [[Rise Records]].

Snedecor left the band in 2013 and was replaced by drummer Josh Manuel while Ben and Cory Ferris were replaced by keyboardist and [[disc jockey]] [[Tyler Acord]] and bassist Skyler Acord, respectively. The band released their [[Issues (Issues album)|self-titled debut studio album]] in 2014, which was praised for its DJ-based breakdowns and mixture of metalcore and [[electronica]], charting at number-nine on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. They released their remix album, ''[[Diamond Dreams (EP)|Diamond Dreams]]'', in November 2014. Their sophomore studio album, ''[[Headspace (Issues album)|Headspace]]'', was released in May 2016.
