'''Farhan Saeed''' is a Pakistani [[singer-songwriter]], [[actor]], [[music video director]], and entrepreneur. Saeed is the former lead vocalist of the Pakistani band [[Jal (band)|Jal]] and is the owner of the restaurant ''Cafe Rock'' in Lahore. He sings in [[Urdu]] as well as in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]. Saeed began acting in 2014, and gained recognition for his role in Hum TV's serial ''[[Udaari]]'' (2016) and for his leading role in another [[Hum TV]] serial ''[[Suno Chanda]]'' (2018).

==Personal life==
Farhan Saeed was born into a [[Kashmiris in Punjab|Punjabi Kashmiri]] family. Both his parents are practising doctors. A music fan from the very start, he used to listen to [[Vital Signs (band)|Vital Signs]] and [[Junoon (band)|Junoon]] and centred his music around pop, and at times folk. In his teens, he took [[A-level|A-Level]] from Keynesian Institute of Management and Sciences (KIMS) and then enrolled for [[Computer science|Computer Sciences]] at [[National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences]], after which he discovered his future band members in [[Atif Aslam]] and [[Goher Mumtaz]]. The band took off and became famous across Asia. In 2011, reports broke out that he had parted his ways from [[Jal (band)|Jal]], which left his fans stunned. He pursued a solo career and became regular to feature in [[Bollywood]]. Saeed opened ''Cafe Rock'' restaurant at Hussain Chowk, situated off the [[M. M. Alam Road]], [[Gulberg, Lahore]]. The restaurant's theme is in a similar vein to that of the ''[[Hard Rock Cafe]]s'', providing underground bands and young aspiring artists with a platform to project themselves and perform in front of an audience. He married [[Urwa Hocane]] on 16 December 2016.<ref>{{cite web|author=admin on |url=http://www.tvmasty.com/farhan-saeeds-cafe-rock-opening-rocked/ |title=Farhan Saeed's Café Rock opening, rocked! |publisher=Tvmasty.com |date=18 February 2010 |access-date=29 January 2012}}</ref>

==Career==
=== Jal ===
Saeed joined the [[Lahore]]-based [[pop rock]] band [[Jal (band)|Jal]] in 2003, replacing their vocalist [[Atif Aslam]], who quit because of "musical differences" with the band's founding member, [[Goher Mumtaz]].<ref>Samarth Goyal (11 August 2018), [https://www.pressreader.com/india/ht-city/20180811/282011853190322 "Farhan Saeed has 'no regrets' on quitting Jal"], ''HT City''. Retrieved 7 November 2018.</ref>

===Solo music career===
In September 2011, in an exclusive interview with ''[[The Express Tribune]]'', Saeed shocked the fans claiming that he has left [[Jal (band)|Jal]] to pursue a solo career despite [[Goher Mumtaz]] offering him to continue his solo career while being a part of [[Jal (band)|Jal]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Mahmood |first=Rafay |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/245392/farhan-leaves-jal/ |title=Farhan leaves Jal – The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |access-date=16 July 2012}}</ref> On 8 September 2011, Saeed's departure was confirmed by [[Jal (band)|Jal]]'s guitarist [[Goher Mumtaz]] who wished him luck for his solo career. He did a collab with [[Aima Baig]], Adnan Qazi and [[Bilal Saeed]] for his super hit song "''Na cher malangaan nu''". His recent song was with [[Hania Aamir]] for Asim Jofa that was directed by Qasim Ali Mureed.

He made his [[Bollywood]]-singing breakthrough in 2014, by contributing a song to [[Vikram Bhatt]]'s ''[[Creature 3D]]''. The song, ''Naam-e-Wafa'', is a romantic-duet with Indian vocalist [[Tulsi Kumar]] as the co-singer and [[Mithoon]] as the [[composer]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Farhan Saeed and Tulsi Kumar – Naam-E-Wafa OST Creature 3D|url=http://www.pakium.com/2014/08/08/farhan-saeed-naam-e-wafa-ost-creature-3d|website=Pakium}}</ref>

===Acting career===
Saeed started his acting career by debuting in a leading role in the 2014 [[Hum TV]] drama serial ''[[De Ijazat Jo Tu]]'' alongside [[Sohai Ali Abro]], [[Saba Hameed]] and [[Javaid Sheikh]]. He then played the lead role as Mohid Shuja in [[ARY Digital]]'s ''Mere Ajnabi'' alongside [[Urwa Hocane]] who was the female lead.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mere Ajnabi - ARY Digital|url = http://www.arydigital.tv/mere-ajnabi/|website = www.arydigital.tv|access-date = 2015-12-10|language = en-US}}</ref> He has also played a lead role of Arsh in the drama ''[[Udaari]]'' as a lawyer along with female lead Urwa. Apart from acting in the drama, Saeed has also collaborated with [[Hadiqa Kiani]] for the OST that has topped music charts all over Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.dawn.com/news/1175455|title=Pop goes the silver screen! How musicians in Pakistan found their niche in cinema - again|first=Ahmer|last=Naqvi|date=30 May 2016}}</ref>

Always in 2016, he also played the lead role again in [[ARY Digital]]'s ''Teri Chah Mein'', alongside [[Maria Wasti]] and [[Saboor Ali]], and [[Hum TV]]'s ''[[Sila (2016 TV series)|Sila]]'' alongside [[Ainy Jaffri]].

In 2018 he grabbed the leading role of Arsal Jamshed Ali (Arsal) in [[Hum TV]]'s hit drama serial ''[[Suno Chanda]]'', with [[Iqra Aziz]] as the leading female role, and due to the critical success of the show, a season 2 was immediately announced by the producers. Saeed is recently{{when?|date=October 2021}} shooting for two upcoming  projects with Hania Amir: One is webseries produced and directed by Wajahat Rauf and the other is a drama, again with Amir, and directed by Qasim Ali Mureed.{{cn|date=October 2021}}

He had the leading role in ''Karachi Se Lahore 3'' with [[Kubra Khan]] as co-star, the third installment of Wajahat Rauf's successful series including the box-office hits ''[[Karachi Se Lahore]]'' and ''[[Lahore Se Aagey]]'', and which would have been his feature film debut, but he had to quit the project because of music tours and concerts he was already committed to.<ref>Ayesha Ghaffar (5 November 2018), [https://www.somethinghaute.com/farhan-saeed-reveals-why-he-opted-out-of-karachi-se-lahore-3/ "Farhan Saeed reveals why he opted out of Karachi Se Lahore 3"], ''SomethingHaute''. Retrieved 6 November 2018.</ref>

In early 2019 it was announced that he'll get his first lead role in a movie in ''Tich Button'', a rom-com co-produced by his wife [[Urwa Hocane]] under their joint new production company ''Shooting Star Studio''.<ref>Staff Report (19 January 2019), [https://dailytimes.com.pk/345597/urwa-confirms-farhan-saeed-feroze-khan-as-tich-button-leads/ "Urwa confirms Farhan Saeed, Feroze Khan as ‘Tich Button’ leads"], ''Daily Times''. Retrieved 3 February 2019.</ref>

===As a director===
He turned to direction with the 2018 music video of ''O Jaana'' from the singer-songwriter Hamza Malik, starring actress [[Iqra Aziz]] and featuring musicians [[Rahat Fateh Ali Khan]] and [[Sahir Ali Bagga]].<ref>NewsBytes (5 January 2018), [https://www.thenews.com.pk/magazine/instep-today/264844-farhan-saeed-set-for-directorial-debut "Farhan Saeed set for directorial debut"], ''International The News''.
