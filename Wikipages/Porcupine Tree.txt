'''Porcupine Tree''' are <!-- This article is written in British English, which commonly treats collective nouns as plural. Please do not change "are" to "is". --> an English rock band formed by musician [[Steven Wilson]] in 1987. During an initial career spanning more than twenty years, they earned critical acclaim from critics and fellow musicians, developed a cult following, and became an influence for new artists.<ref>{{cite web|access-date=16 August 2017|url=http://www.popmatters.com/feature/porcupine-tree-050907/|title=Finding a Prickly Place in History|website=[[PopMatters]]|first=Eddie|last=Ciminelli|quote=[...] Through the years, they have amassed over a dozen albums in their discography, [...] while collecting critical adulation and a cultish following.

The band began as a solo project for Wilson, who initially created all of the band's music himself. By late 1993, however, he wanted to work in a band environment, bringing on frequent collaborators [[Richard Barbieri]] as keyboardist, [[Colin Edwin]] as bassist, and [[Chris Maitland]] as drummer to form the first permanent lineup. With Wilson as lead vocalist and guitarist, this remained the lineup until February 2002, when Maitland left the band and [[Gavin Harrison]] was recruited to replace him. Porcupine Tree's early sound evoked various styles of [[psychedelic rock]], [[space rock]] and [[experimental rock]], later moving towards a more [[progressive rock|progressive]]/space rock direction comparable to that of [[Pink Floyd]]. Upon signing with [[Kscope]] [[record label]] in the late 1990s, the band began to approach a more mainstream [[alternative rock]] sound. By the early 2000s, the band had signed to a [[major record label]] and shifted their sound again, this time in a more [[progressive metal]] direction. 

In 2010, after the tour in support of their 2009 studio album ''[[The Incident (album)|The Incident]]'' (their biggest commercial success to date), the band became inactive as Wilson committed himself to his solo work and other members began working on their own separate projects. In 2018, after years of indetermination, Wilson ruled out a possible reformation. 
 	
Despite this, the band made a surprise reformation in 2021 with minimal advance publicity, this time with a trio line-up of Wilson, Barbieri and Harrison. The reformation was formally revealed on 1 November 2021, with the simultaneous release of the "Harridan" single and the announcement of a new studio album, ''[[Closure/Continuation]]'', to be released on 24 June 2022.

==History==
===Origins (1987–1990)===
Porcupine Tree originated in 1987 as a collaborative hoax project by Steven Wilson and Malcolm Stocks. Partially inspired by the [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]/[[Progressive rock|progressive]] bands of the 1970s, such as Pink Floyd, that had dominated the music scene during their youth, the two decided to form a fictional legendary rock band named The Porcupine Tree. The two fabricated a detailed back-story including information on alleged band members and album titles, as well as a "colourful" history which purportedly included events such as a meeting at a 1970s rock festival and several trips in and out of prison. As soon as he had put aside enough money to buy his own studio equipment, Wilson obliged this creation with several hours of music to provide "evidence" of its existence.<ref name="Dutch Progressive Rock Page">{{cite web|url =http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1999_01|title =Porcupine Tree: Stupid Dream|website=The Dutch Progressive Rock Page|first =Ed|last =Sander|access-date =7 January 2007|url-status =live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070220010926/http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1999_01 |archive-date=2007-02-20 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Although Stocks provided a few passages of treated vocals and experimental guitar playing, his role in the project was mostly offering occasional ideas, with the bulk of the material being written, recorded, played, and sung by Wilson.

At this point, Porcupine Tree was little more than a joke and a private amusement, as Wilson was concentrating on his other project, [[No-Man]], an endeavour with UK based singer and songwriter [[Tim Bowness]]. However, by 1989, he began to consider some of the Porcupine Tree music as potentially marketable. Wilson created an 80-minute-long [[audio cassette|cassette]] titled ''[[Tarquin's Seaweed Farm]]'' under the name of Porcupine Tree.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography"/> Still showing the spirit of his joke, Wilson included an eight-page inlay which further revealed the hoaxed Porcupine Tree backstory, including references to fictitious band members such as Sir Tarquin Underspoon and Timothy Tadpole-Jones.<ref name="Steven Wilson -The Complete Discography (6th Edition)">{{cite web|url=http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf|title=Steven Wilson -The Complete Discography (6th Edition), p. 20|access-date=15 May 2007|first=Uwe|last=Häberle|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621210549/http://www.voyage-pt.de/swdisco.pdf|archive-date=21 June 2007}}</ref>

Wilson sent out copies of ''Tarquin's Seaweed Farm'' to several people he felt would be interested in the recordings. Nick Saloman, the cult UK guitarist better known as [[The Bevis Frond]], had suggested that he send one to Richard Allen, a writer for the UK counter-cultural magazine ''[[Encyclopaedia Psychedelica]]'' and co-editor of the UK psychedelic [[garage rock]] magazine ''[[Freakbeat]]''. Allen reviewed the tape in both magazines. Whilst he disliked some of the material, he gave much of it a positive review. Several months later, Allen invited Wilson to contribute a track to the double LP ''A Psychedelic Psauna'' that was being put together to launch the new Delerium label. Allen would also become the band's manager, press agent, and promoter until 2004, his role in marketing the band's image decreasing after ''The Sky Moves Sideways'' album. In the meantime, Wilson had continued to work on new material. In 1990, he released the ''[[Love, Death & Mussolini]]'' EP, issued in a very limited run of 10 copies.<ref name="Dutch Progressive Rock Page"/>  The EP remains an extremely rare, collectible piece. It was composed of nine at-the-time-unreleased tracks, as a preview for the upcoming second album. In 1991, Wilson released a second full-length Porcupine Tree cassette called ''[[The Nostalgia Factory]]'', which further expanded Porcupine Tree's underground fanbase, although at this point, the band was still carrying on the charade of being 1970s rock legends. By this point, Porcupine Tree was entirely a solo project, with Stocks having amicably moved on to other activities.

===The Delerium years (1991–1997)===

====''On the Sunday of Life...''====
Along with the ''A Psychedelic Psauna'' compilation, which featured the Porcupine Tree track "Linton Samuel Dawson", the newly formed [[Delerium Records|Delerium]] label, formed by ''Freakbeat'' editors Richard Allen and Ivor Trueman, offered to reissue the cassettes ''Tarquin's Seaweed Farm'' and ''The Nostalgia Factory''. Two hundred copies of each cassette were sold through ''Freakbeat's'' mail order, The Freak Emporium, and soon Porcupine Tree became known as a mysterious new act amongst the then UK underground psychedelic music scene.

Shortly thereafter, Delerium invited Wilson to sign as one of the label's founder artists. The first release after this, a double vinyl album and single CD compiling the best material from his two cassettes, was released in mid-1992 as ''[[On the Sunday of Life]]'', a title chosen from a long list of possible nonsense titles compiled by Richard Allen. The rest of the music from the initial tapes was released on the limited edition [[compilation album]] ''[[Yellow Hedgerow Dreamscape]]''.<ref name="Dutch Progressive Rock Page"/>

In 1992, Delerium released ''On the Sunday of Life'' as an edition of 1,000 copies, complete with a deluxe gatefold sleeve. The album sold very well, particularly in Italy, and it was briefly repressed on vinyl and has remained in print on CD ever since its release. The album featured future concert favourite and frequent [[encore (concert)|encore]] song "Radioactive Toy". By 2000, ''On the Sunday of Life...'' had accumulated sales of more than 20,000 copies.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography">{{cite web|url= http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.cfm|title= Porcupine Tree Biography|website= PorcupineTree.com|access-date= 15 May 2007|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080410092648/http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.cfm|archive-date= 10 April 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref> ''On the Sunday of Life'' was originally meant to be a quadruple (LP)/double (CD) album compiling both cassettes in full, but changed to the best (according to Wilson) songs from the tapes. In 2004, Wilson remixed and remastered all three tapes, releasing them as a three-CD box set called ''Footprints: Cassette Music 1988-1992''. This box was only distributed to family and friends.

====''Up the Downstair''====
In the midst of Porcupine Tree's rising success, Wilson's other band, No-Man, had been getting excellent UK press, which led to the band being signed to leading UK independent music publisher, Hit & Run Music Publishing, in 1991, which resulted in recording agreements with [[One Little Indian Records]], and Epic 440/Sony in the US. No-Man's success gave Wilson the opportunity to leave his regular job and devote his time solely to music. All of the Delirium releases were published by Hit & Run, whose executive Dave Massey had signed No-Man and continued to be closely involved in Wilson's Porcupine Tree project.

In May 1993, the second Porcupine Tree album, ''[[Up the Downstair]]'', was released, another prospective double album that was finally slimmed down to a single record. "Voyage 34" was actually going to take up the second disc, but it was last decided to be released alone as a single. The album was highly praised, ''[[Melody Maker]]'' describing it as "a psychedelic masterpiece... one of the albums of the year."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.delerium.co.uk/delerium/releases/delec020.html|title=Delerium Records: Porcupine Tree – Up The Downstair|date=2000|access-date=18 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070826202210/http://www.delerium.co.uk/delerium/releases/delec020.html |archive-date=26 August 2007}}</ref> The album continued the [[fusion (music)|fusion]] of [[electronic music]] and rock and also featured guest appearances from two future Porcupine Tree members, [[Richard Barbieri]], of 1970s-80s art rock band [[Japan (band)|Japan]], and [[Colin Edwin]].

In November 1993, ''[[Voyage 34]]'' was reissued alongside an additional [[12-inch single|12-inch]] [[remix]] by Astralasia. The album managed to enter the ''[[NME]]'' indie chart for six weeks and became an underground chill-out classic, even without radio play.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography" />

====''The Sky Moves Sideways''====
The profile of Porcupine Tree had now grown to the extent that Wilson wanted to expand into live performances. Thus, in December 1993, Porcupine Tree became a live unit featuring Steven Wilson on lead vocals/guitar, Colin Edwin on bass, Chris Maitland on drums, and Richard Barbieri on keyboards.<ref name="MusicPlayers">{{cite web|url= http://www.musicplayers.com/features/guitars/2007/0707_Steven_Wilson.php|title=  Steven Wilson: Fear of a Blank Interview |website=MusicPlayers.com |first= Scott |last=Kahn|access-date= 8 April 2008}}</ref>

All three new members of the group had worked with Wilson on various projects over the preceding years, especially Barbieri and Maitland, who had been part of No-Man's touring band. The new line-up's first live album, ''[[Spiral Circus]]'', contained recordings from their first three performances, including a [[BBC Radio 1|BBC Radio One]] session for [[Mark Radcliffe (radio broadcaster)|Mark Radcliffe]], an early champion of the group.

Porcupine Tree's next album did not emerge until early 1995, but was preceded by the ''[[Moonloop]]'' EP, the last two tracks of which were recorded during the album sessions and were the first to feature the new band. Released in 1995, the band's third studio album, ''[[The Sky Moves Sideways]]'' became a success among [[progressive rock]] fans and Porcupine Tree were hailed as the Pink Floyd of the 1990s. Wilson later lamented this, stating, "I can't help that. It's true that during the period of ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', I had done a little too much of it in the sense of satisfying, in a way, the fans of Pink Floyd who were listening to us because that group doesn't make albums any more. Moreover, I regret it."<ref name="Dutch Progressive Rock Page"/>

''The Sky Moves Sideways'' was an expansive [[soundscape]] of [[melody]] and ambient rock experimentation, but proved to be a transitional work with half recorded before the formation of the band and half recorded after. Most of the album was taken up with the 35-minute title track, which at one point Steven had intended to be long enough to occupy the whole album. An alternate version of the track, containing some of the excised music, was included on the 2004 remastered version of the album. It also entered the ''NME'', ''Melody Maker'', and ''[[Music Week]]'' charts.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Biography" /> Together with the ''Moonloop'' EP, this album was the first Porcupine Tree music issued in [[Americas|America]] in the autumn of 1995, and attracted favourable press on both sides of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]]. The band supported the album with numerous concerts throughout the year at major music venues in the UK, the Netherlands, Italy, and Greece.

====''Signify''====
Partly unsatisfied with the half band/half solo nature of ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', Porcupine Tree promptly got down to the task of recording the first proper band record. Wilson admitted he was always "in love with the idea of the rock band" because "bands have a kind of glamour, and appeal, and a romance about them the solo projects just don't have."<ref name="Aural Innovations Issue No.7">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue7/ptree03.html|title=Porcupine Tree (Review/Interview)|magazine=Aural Innovations|first1=Jerry|last1=Kranitz|first2=Keith|last2=Henderson|date=July 1999|issue=7|access-date=7 January 2007|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312134918/http://www.aural-innovations.com/issues/issue7/ptree03.html |archive-date=2007-03-12}}</ref> The band worked sporadically over the next year on developing a tighter and more ambitious rock sound.

After the release of the first real Porcupine Tree single, "[[Waiting (Porcupine Tree song)|Waiting]]", which entered all UK indie charts and the UK National chart and attracting airplay all over Europe, ''[[Signify]]'' was released in September 1996. The album was a mixture of instrumental tracks and more song-oriented tunes, blending numerous rock and ''[[avant-garde]]'' styles, such as [[krautrock]].<ref name="even less">{{cite web |last=Ezell |first=Brice |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/post/156385-progs-only-stupid-dream-porcupine-tree-even-less |title=Prog's Only Stupid Dream: Porcupine Tree - "Even Less" |website=[[PopMatters]] |date= 2 April 2012|access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref> Wilson expressed satisfaction in the direction of the album, stating "...tracks like 'Every Home Is Wired' and 'Dark Matter' totally transcend both genre and comparison. Finally, I think we are making a completely original and 1990s form of music, but which still has its root in progressive music."<ref name="Record Collector November 1996, issue 207">{{cite web |url=http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.interviews.cfm?press=interview007 |title=Record Collector |date=November 1996 |issue=207 |access-date=7 January 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114142444/http://www.porcupinetree.com/background.interviews.cfm?press=interview007|archive-date= 14 November 2006|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The musicians received writing credits for some tracks, most notably for "Intermediate Jesus", which evolved from a jam session later released as ''[[Metanoia (Porcupine Tree album)|Metanoia]]'' at the end of 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porcupinetree.com/discography.details.cfm?albumid=97|title=Porcupine Tree – Discography|publisher=porcupinetree.com|access-date=6 April 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405052425/http://www.porcupinetree.com/discography.details.cfm?albumid=97|archive-date=5 April 2008}}</ref> A large amount of major European media interest accompanied the album's release.

In March 1997, they played three nights in Rome to an audience that surpassed 5,000&nbsp;people. All three dates were recorded for use in the 1997 live album ''[[Coma Divine – Recorded Live in Rome]]'' that was released as a goodbye to Delerium Records, which felt it could no longer offer the kind of resources the band needed  to continue to build its profile worldwide.<ref name="Dutch Progressive">{{cite web|url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1999_01|title=DPRP : Counting Out Time: Porcupine Tree – Stupid Dream.|publisher=The Dutch Progressive Rock Page|access-date=16 July 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717080037/http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1999_01|archive-date=2008-07-17}}</ref> In late 1997 Porcupine Tree's first three albums were [[remaster]]ed and reissued. ''Signify'' also was released in the US on [[Miles Copeland III|Miles Copeland]]'s [[Ark 21 Records|Ark 21]] label.

===The Snapper years (1998–2001)===

====''Stupid Dream''====
Wilson, Barbieri, Edwin, and Maitland spent all of 1998 recording their fifth studio album, a release that reflected the band's move towards a more song-oriented writing. Wilson acknowledged this time he was "much more interested in songwriting as an art form, as opposed to soundscape development" and commented he took influence from [[The Beach Boys]]' ''[[Pet Sounds]]'', [[Todd Rundgren]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young]], and "anything with really good ensemble singing". He also indicated that he was "interested in the idea of the pop song as a kind of experimental symphony".<ref name="Dutch Progressive Rock Page"/>

The band recorded the album without a label, but signed with [[Snapper Music|Snapper]]/[[Kscope]] before releasing ''Stupid Dream'', in March 1999. The album was supported by a tour of the United Kingdom, Italy, Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, France, Poland, and the United States. The three singles taken from the album: "[[Piano Lessons (single)|Piano Lessons]]", "[[Stranger by the Minute]]", and "[[Pure Narcotic]]", all achieved mainstream exposure in the US and in Europe, and placed well in the UK independent charts and on radio-station playlists. Although the album was a departure from their earlier sound, it brought the band new-found popularity and went on to become the band's best-selling and most acclaimed release up to that time.

====''Lightbulb Sun''====
Completed for February 2000, with string arrangements provided by [[Dave Gregory (musician)|Dave Gregory]] of [[XTC]], Porcupine Tree's sixth studio album, ''[[Lightbulb Sun]]'', built on the mix of songwriting, soundscaping, and rock dynamics of ''Stupid Dream''. The album was released in May 2000, preceded by the single "[[Four Chords That Made a Million]]".

A special double CD edition of the ''Lightbulb Sun'' album was issued in [[Israel]] and Germany.

In May, the band released a compilation [[B-side]] album called ''[[Recordings (album)|Recordings]]'', which featured nine tracks from the ''Stupid Dream'' and ''Lightbulb Sun'' sessions that had been left off both albums. In May 2001, Porcupine Tree did three consecutive dates as a support band to [[Marillion]], in France, Germany, and the Netherlands.<ref name="Porcupine Tree Gig">{{cite web|url= http://www.porcupinetree.com/tour.giglisting.cfm|title= Porcupine Tree – Complete Tour History|publisher= porcupinetree.com|access-date= 2 April 2008|url-status= dead|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100726143357/http://www.porcupinetree.com/tour.giglisting.cfm|archive-date= 26 July 2010|df= dmy-all}}</ref> In June, the band played a short US tour, starting with an appearance in [[NEARfest]] of [[Pennsylvania]], and culminating in a sold-out show at [[The Bottom Line (venue)|The Bottom Line]] in New York City. Shortly afterwards, the band announced that they had signed a new international record deal with [[Lava Records|Lava]]/[[Atlantic Records]].

===The Lava years (2002–2005)===

====''In Absentia''====
In February 2002, Porcupine Tree's first and only line-up change occurred when drummer Chris Maitland was dismissed after eight years with the band. The band welcomed drummer and longtime acquaintance Gavin Harrison as his replacement. In March 2002, a [[box set]] of the band's early work was released, ''[[Stars Die: The Delerium Years 1991–1997]]'', and the band commenced recording their first major label album, drawing from a pool of 30 new songs written by Wilson in the previous two years. Recording sessions took place at [[Avatar Studios]] in New York<ref name="Free Williamsburg">{{cite web|url=http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/september_2002/porcupine.html|title=Porcupine Tree interview|date=September 2002|publisher=Free Williamsburg|first=Alexander|last=Laurence|access-date=13 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080504013339/http://www.freewilliamsburg.com/september_2002/porcupine.html|archive-date=4 May 2008}}</ref> and London, with veteran audio engineer [[Paul Northfield]] and string arranger Dave Gregory also playing major roles in the making of the record. The album was mixed in Los Angeles in May with [[Tim Palmer]].

The resulting album, ''[[In Absentia]]'', was released by [[Lava Records]] in September 2002. The band also released a [[Surround sound|5.1 surround-sound]] version of the album, mixed by [[Grammy Award]]-winning producer [[Elliot Scheiner]]. The surround-sound version of the album won the award for best 5.1 mix at the 2004 Surround Sound Music awards in Los Angeles.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highfidelityreview.com/news/news.asp?newsnumber=10783423 |title=2004 Surround Music Award Winners and Exclusive Report |access-date=5 September 2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315232926/http://www.highfidelityreview.com/news/news.asp?newsnumber=10783423 |archive-date=15 March 2005 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

To promote the album, the band undertook four tours of Europe and North America, including one with acclaimed Swedish [[heavy metal music|metal]] band [[Opeth]]. On tour, the new line-up of the band was further augmented by additional touring vocalist/guitarist [[John Wesley (guitarist)|John Wesley]]. During these tours, the visual element of the band's performance was taken to new heights with the involvement of [[film director|filmmaker]] and photographer [[Lasse Hoile]], who had created the cover art for ''In Absentia'' and now went on to create a dark and [[Surrealism|surreal]] visual to Porcupine Tree's music. The long [[Advertising campaign|promotional campaign]] for ''In Absentia'' ended on 30 November 2003, as the band played a homecoming show to a sold-out [[London Astoria]].<ref name="Porcupine Tree Gig"/>

During 2003, Porcupine Tree set up their own label, Transmission, with an [[online shop|online store]] hosted by Burning Shed record label. The first release on the Transmission label was a studio session recorded for [[XM Satellite Radio|XM Radio]], Washington, DC, followed in 2004 by a recording from Polish radio in 2001. The band used the label to issue supplemental content, such as EPs, demos, and live recordings. Additionally, a reissue/remaster campaign also began in 2003, with many of the early albums expanded to double CDs. These reissues included re-recorded/remixed double-CD versions of the ''Up the Downstair'', ''The Sky Moves Sideways'', and ''Signify'' albums, and the reissue of ''Stupid Dream'' and ''Lightbulb Sun'', both comprising a CD with a new stereo mix of the album plus a [[DVD-Audio]] with a 5.1 surround mix.

====''Deadwing''====
In early 2004, the band embarked on the recording sessions for their next record, ''[[Deadwing]]'', their second for Lava/Atlantic. The album takes its inspiration from a [[screenplay|film script]] written by Wilson with his filmmaker friend Mike Bennion.  The album sessions completed in November 2004, and ''Deadwing'' was released in Europe and the US during the spring of 2005 as both a stereo and 5.1 surround-sound album, preceded by the release of two singles, "[[Shallow (Porcupine Tree song)|Shallow]]" in the US and "[[Lazarus (Porcupine Tree song)|Lazarus]]" in Europe. The album benefited from guest appearances by [[Adrian Belew]] from [[King Crimson]] and Opeth's [[Mikael Åkerfeldt]], and was a commercial success, due in part to "Shallow" receiving airplay, peaking at number 26 on ''[[Billboard Charts|Billboard]]'s'' [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks]].<ref name="Billboard Peak Position of 'Shallow'">{{cite web|url= http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=141384&model.vnuAlbumId=785460|title= Billboard Peak Position of 'Shallow'| access-date= 7 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411075011/http://billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.vnuArtistId=141384&model.vnuAlbumId=785460 |archive-date= 11 April 2008}}</ref> Additionally, "Lazarus" entered the German singles Top 100 at number 91.<ref name="Germany Singles Top 100">{{cite web|url= http://acharts.us/song/4541|title= Porcupine Tree – Lazarus – Music Charts|publisher= αCharts.us|access-date= 21 January 2007|url-status= live|archive-url= http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110630004757/http://acharts.us/song/4541|archive-date= 30 June 2011|df= dmy-all}}</ref> The song "Shallow" was also featured in the soundtrack for the film ''[[Four Brothers (film)|Four Brothers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430105/soundtrack|title=Four Brothers (2005) – Soundtracks|website=[[The Internet Movie Database]]|access-date=2 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026175441/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0430105/soundtrack|archive-date=26 October 2007}}</ref>

The tour to promote the album commenced in the UK at the end of March, and continued throughout the year. Mike Bennion created a [[Myspace]] page dedicated to the prospective ''Deadwing'' film, in which he posted the first 15 pages of the script and included a [[trailer (film)|trailer]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.myspace.com/deadwing|title= MySpace.com – deadwing – UK – www.myspace.com/deadwing|access-date= 15 July 2008|url-status= live|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080707014445/http://www.myspace.com/deadwing|archive-date= 7 July 2008|df= dmy-all}}</ref> However, whilst the scripts are finished, the project is still on hiatus due to lack of budget.<ref name="DPRP Specials">{{cite web|url=http://www.dprp.net/specials/2008_porcupinetree/index.php|title=DPRP Specials – Porcupine Tree – Interview 2008|first1=Martien|last1=Koolen|first2=Bart Jan|last2=van der Vorst|publisher=The Dutch Progressive Rock Page|access-date=5 April 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402054123/http://www.dprp.net/specials/2008_porcupinetree/index.php|archive-date=2 April 2008}}</ref>

The band started recording their tenth studio album, ''[[The Incident (album)|The Incident]]'', in February 2009.

On 12 June 2009, details were revealed on the Porcupine Tree website, "the record is set to be released via Roadrunner Records worldwide on 21 September, as a double CD. The centrepiece is the title track, which takes up the whole of the first disc. The 55-minute work is described as a slightly surreal song cycle about beginnings and endings and the sense that ‘after this, things will never be the same again.’ The self-produced album is completed by four standalone compositions that developed out of band writing sessions last December – Flicker, Bonnie The Cat, Black Dahlia, and Remember Me Lover feature on a separate EP-length disc to stress their independence from the song cycle."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.porcupinetree.com/news.cfm#1669|title=The Incident|publisher=Porcupine Tree|date=12 June 2009|access-date=15 June 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080604161429/http://www.porcupinetree.com/news.cfm#1669|archive-date=4 June 2008}}</ref> The album was the band's biggest commercial success to date, reaching number 23 in the UK album charts and also reaching the US'' Billboard ''Top 25.

The band also released another live album, ''[[Atlanta (album)|Atlanta]]'', in June 2010. The performance was actually recorded during the tour of ''Fear of a Blank Planet'' at the Roxy theatre, Atlanta, on 29 October 2007. It was released via online distribution only, with all the sale proceeds donated to [[Mick Karn]] for his treatment against cancer.<ref>[http://www.mickkarn.net/ MICK KARN APPEAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229170038/http://mickkarn.net/ |date=29 December 2010 }}, – 4 June 2010. mickkarn.net</ref>

===Inactivity and hiatus (2011–2020)===
After finishing the touring cycle for ''The Incident'' in 2010, Wilson spent the rest of the year, and 2011, recording and releasing his second solo album, ''[[Grace for Drowning]]'', and Blackfield's third album, ''[[Welcome to my DNA]]''. Initially, the band had mentioned the possibility of working on new music in 2012, with Wilson mentioning "early 2012",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-guitarist-steven-wilson-blackfield-and-porcupine-tree |title=Interview: Guitarist Steven Wilson of Blackfield and Porcupine Tree |magazine=[[Guitar World]] |date=6 July 2011 |author=Siwasaki |access-date=17 October 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107042218/http://www.guitarworld.com/interview-guitarist-steven-wilson-blackfield-and-porcupine-tree |archive-date=7 November 2011}}</ref> and Harrison guessing they would start work in 2012 and release music in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hit-channel.com/gavin-harrison-solo-05ricporcupine-treeking-crimson/2618 |title=Interview:Gavin Harrison (Solo & 05Ric,Porcupine Tree,King Crimson) |access-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812010336/http://www.hit-channel.com/gavin-harrison-solo-05ricporcupine-treeking-crimson/2618 |archive-date=12 August 2014  |date=12 April 2012 }}</ref> However, this soon changed, with Wilson announcing that he would continue to focus his future on his solo career. This new focus included a second leg of touring in support of ''Grace for Drowning'' in the first half of 2012, recording a third solo album in the second half of the year with his touring band,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/steven-wilson-soloporcupine-treeblackfieldno-man/2517|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812010122/http://www.hit-channel.com/steven-wilson-soloporcupine-treeblackfieldno-man/2517|archive-date=12 August 2014 |title=Interview: Steven Wilson (solo, Porcupine Tree, Blackfield, No-Man)|date=December 2011|publication-date=12 April 2012|publisher=Hit Channel|author= Thodoris |access-date=14 June 2016}}</ref> releasing it in early 2013,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42991 |title=Steven Wilson: Luck's What You Make It |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |access-date=29 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202111701/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42991 |archive-date=2 February 2014}}</ref> and then touring in support of the third solo album for "much of the year" – throughout 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42991&pg=2 |title=Steven Wilson: Luck's What You Make It |publisher=Allaboutjazz.com |access-date=29 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202111704/http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=42991&pg=2 |archive-date=2 February 2014}}</ref> Wilson still maintained that the band "haven’t split up" and that there are "no intentions of splitting up",<ref name="discordmagazine.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.godaddy.com/forsale/discordmagazine.com?utm_source=TDFS_BINNS&utm_medium=BINNS&utm_campaign=TDFS_BINNS&traffic_type=TDFS_BINNS&traffic_id=binns&|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217024844/http://www.discordmagazine.com/steven-wilson-the-definitive-interview/|url-status=dead|title=discordmagazine.com|archivedate=17 December 2012|website=Godaddy.com|access-date=25 June 2021}}</ref> but he also said there were no specific plans for a new album either.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stereoboard.com/content/view/169396/9 |title=Steven Wilson, The Progressive Music Legend, Talks To Stereoboard About His Solo Work (Interview P2) |publisher=Stereoboard |date=9 December 2011 |access-date=29 June 2014}}</ref> While he said that he still "want(s) to get Porcupine Tree back together at some point", he said that he was not sure what direction he wants to take the band, only that he is "tired of metal music",<ref name="rollingstoneindia.com"/> and that one member of the band does not like [[jazz]], so it won't go into the direction of his solo project either.<ref name="discordmagazine.com"/>

In June 2012, Wilson re-emphasised his continued focus on his solo career, with his answer to the question "...is (there) a danger that Porcupine Tree might fall by the wayside?" being, "The honest answer is I don’t know. The solo career for me now is probably the most important. I think about it more than anything else, I’m more focused on it than anything else, I enjoy it more than anything else..."<ref name="rollingstoneindia.com">{{cite web |url=http://rollingstoneindia.com/home-flashbox/backstage-with-steven-wilson/ |title=Backstage with Steven Wilson |magazine=[[Rolling Stone|Rolling Stone India]] |date=24 June 2012 |access-date=29 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904091553/http://rollingstoneindia.com/home-flashbox/backstage-with-steven-wilson/ |archive-date=4 September 2012}}</ref> A two-disc live album titled ''[[Octane Twisted]]'' was released that following November by their record label, Kscope, containing a live recording of ''The Incident'' in its entirety, from material recorded at 2010 concerts at the Riviera Theater, Chicago, and the [[Royal Albert Hall]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/podcast/|title=Kscope|publisher=[[Kscope]]|date=3 August 2012|access-date=3 August 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807034959/http://www.kscopemusic.com/podcast/|archive-date=7 August 2012}}</ref> In May 2013, Wilson reiterated his stance on the band's status, stating that it's "...not to say the band has broken up or anything like that. It’s always conceivable that we could get back together in a year or five years, or 10 years. I really can’t say – there are no plans at the moment."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progrockmag.com/news/porcupine-tree-on-hold-steven-wilson-confirms/ | title=Porcupine Tree On Hold, Steven Wilson Confirms | date= 18 April 2013| first=Martin | last= Kielty |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130421004733/http://www.progrockmag.com/news/porcupine-tree-on-hold-steven-wilson-confirms/|archive-date=21 April 2013 }}</ref> Edwin's stance mirrored this.<ref name="technologytell.com"/>

After Wilson released his third solo album, ''[[The Raven That Refused to Sing (And Other Stories)]]'' in February 2013, and toured in support of it for the remainder of the year, its success led Wilson to commit to writing and recording a fourth solo album ''[[Hand. Cannot. Erase.]]'' over the course of 2014 and releasing it in 2015, pushing hypothetical work with Porcupine Tree into at least 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/the-raven-anniversary-update-from-steven-wilson/ |title='The Raven…' anniversary update from SW – |publisher=Stevenwilsonhq.com |date=18 February 2014 |access-date=29 June 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140623192806/http://stevenwilsonhq.com/sw/the-raven-anniversary-update-from-steven-wilson/ |archive-date=23 June 2014}}</ref> In March 2015, Wilson commented, “if Porcupine Tree [were] to get back together—and, by the way, I have never ruled that out—it will be a side project. There should be no question in anyone's mind that this is now my main musical path, my solo work.”<ref name="under the radar">{{cite web |url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/steven_wilson |publisher=Under the Radar |title=Steven Wilson: Hiding in Plain Sight |date=2 March 2015 |access-date=5 March 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307180520/http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/steven_wilson |archive-date=7 March 2015}}</ref>

Moving into 2016, Wilson's views on a reformation were conflicting. In February 2016, in an interview with ''Prog Magazine'', he stated that there was a "strong possibility" of Porcupine Tree reforming for another studio album at an undisclosed time in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/steven_wilson_confirms_he_will_very_likely_release_a_new_album_with_porcupine_tree.html|title=Steven Wilson Confirms He Will Very Likely Release a New Album With Porcupine Tree - Music News @ Ultimate-Guitar.Com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160803055724/https://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/upcoming_releases/steven_wilson_confirms_he_will_very_likely_release_a_new_album_with_porcupine_tree.html|archive-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> However, in response to a question in August 2016 regarding a hypothetical Porcupine Tree performance, Wilson claimed, "you'd be waiting for a long time, that band doesn't exist anymore."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/StevenWilsonHQ/videos/vb.114657261887878/1193098617377065/?type=2&theater|title=Steven Wilson - Timeline {{!}} Facebook|website=Facebook.com|access-date=4 August 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428024151/https://www.facebook.com/StevenWilsonHQ/videos/vb.114657261887878/1193098617377065/?type=2&theater|archive-date=28 April 2018}}</ref> In August 2017, Wilson explained: "It's no coincidence that since my solo project has taken off, other collaborations have receded to the background. Porcupine Tree hasn't made a record since 2009 and No-Man hasn't made a record since 2008. I feel less need now to be creatively involved in something other than my solo work.

In a March 2018 interview when asked about the chances of further activity from Porcupine Tree he responded; "Honestly, I would say zero, because I’m just not that kind of person. I don’t go backwards. I’m not interested in going backwards; I want to move forwards, I want to do different things, I want to work with different people, I want to explore different kinds of music. That would seem like a terribly backward step to me.

===Reunion and ''Closure/Continuation'' (2021–present)===
On 27 October 2021, Porcupine Tree, Wilson, and Harrison all shared a teaser video and mailing list link across their social media accounts, along with a stylised "P/T C/C" image. On 1 November the band announced their eleventh album, ''[[Closure/Continuation]]'', to be released in June 2022 on [[Music For Nations]], along with their first single in over 12 years, "Harridan".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/porcupine-tree-return-with-new-single-harridan-and-closure-continuation-album-announcement-3084235|title=Porcupine Tree return with new single 'Harridan' and 'CLOSURE/CONTINUATION' album announcement|accessdate=November 1, 2021|date=November 1, 2021|last=Krol|first=Charlotte|publisher=[[NME]]}}</ref>

==Musical style==
===Influences===
Some of the inherent musical background of Porcupine Tree goes back to Wilson's childhood, when his parents gave Christmas presents to each other. His father received Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' whilst his mother got [[Donna Summer]]'s ''[[Love to Love You Baby (album)|Love to Love You Baby]]'', both of which Wilson listened to heavily. These albums influenced his further songwriting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kscopemusic.com/stevenwilson/insurgentes/biography.html|title=Steven Wilson Insurgentes Biography|publisher=[[Kscope]]|access-date=11 April 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100207134659/http://www.kscopemusic.com/stevenwilson/insurgentes/biography.html|archive-date=7 February 2010}}</ref> Other influences include [[Camel (band)|Camel]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hit-channel.com/interviewsteven-wilson-soloporcupine-tree/46767|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029205340/http://www.hit-channel.com/interviewsteven-wilson-soloporcupine-tree/46767|archive-date=29 October 2013 |access-date=14 June 2016|title=Interview: Steven Wilson (solo, Porcupine Tree)|publisher=Hit Channel|date=June 2013|publication-date=12 April 2012|author= Thodoris }}</ref> and [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/steven-wilson-i-cant-emphasise-how-much-i-learned-working-with-king-crimsom|title=Steven Wilson: I Can't Emphasise How Much I Learned Working With King Crimson|last=Moon|first=Grant|date=26 September 2016|website=Louder Sound|access-date=30 November 2021}}</ref>

Later in his teens, Wilson briefly became a fan of the [[new wave of British heavy metal]], but as soon as he discovered [[1970s in music|1970s]] music and progressive rock, his interest in metal diminished in favour of experimental music. He later (in the 2000s) discovered bands in the likes of [[Gojira (band)|Gojira]], [[Sunn O)))]], [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], and [[Meshuggah]], which restored his faith in metal music. "For a long time, I couldn't find where all these creative musicians were going...", said Wilson, "and I found them, they were working in [[extreme metal]]." Shortly thereafter, he went on to produce three consecutive albums by Swedish [[progressive death metal]] band Opeth, which had a considerable influence in his further songwriting.<ref name="metal storm">{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.ee/pub/interview.php?interview_id=453|author=Jeff|location=Toulouse, France|title=Porcupine Tree interview (01/2008)|website=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|publication-date=1 January 2008|date=19 November 2007|access-date=7 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927085330/http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/interview.php?interview_id=453|archive-date=27 September 2011}}</ref>

===Characteristics===
The music of Porcupine Tree is often described as melancholic.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Wilson has stated music is a way for him to channel all his negative feelings,<ref name="Innerviews 1">{{ cite web | last = Prasad | first = Anil | author-link = Anil Prasad | website = Innerviews | url = http://www.innerviews.org/inner/ptree.html | title = Porcupine Tree – Shadows and light | access-date = 8 April 2008 | date = 2004 | url-status = live | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080328040658/http://www.innerviews.org/inner/ptree.html | archive-date = 28 March 2008 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> and "an exorcism of those elements within",<ref name="Innerviews 2">{{cite web |last=Prasad |first=Anil |url=http://www.innerviews.org/inner/ptree2.html |title=Porcupine Tree – Cinematic catharsis |date=2005 |website=Innerviews |access-date=8 April 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328214858/http://www.innerviews.org/inner/ptree2.html |archive-date=28 March 2008}}</ref> finding it "easier to write songs about the negative side of the world than it is about the happy side of the world."<ref name="DPRP 2001"/> In the ''Warszawa'' live radio broadcast album, before performing "Stop Swimming", Wilson can be heard saying "the saddest music is often the most beautiful."

Porcupine Tree is an album-oriented band, making records where many songs are related to each other.<ref name="Free Williamsburg"/>  Wilson has said: <blockquote>"The important thing with Porcupine Tree is that all our songs have a unique sound world that they inhabit. I don't like the idea of any song sounding like any other song. So most of the time it's a case of finding the sound world first whether it be a texture or a drum rhythm that sets you off on a certain musical path, or particular musical atmosphere, or flavour."<ref name="Free Williamsburg"/></blockquote> For their recordings, the band has included [[mellotron]], [[banjo]], [[hammered dulcimer]], and [[guimbri]], among other instruments unusual for rock bands.{{opinion|date=November 2021}}

Above all, Porcupine Tree's music has maintained a strong textural and experimental quality, often fusing many genres in a single track. The band's work is noted for its [[ambient music|atmospheric]] nature, largely due to Barbieri's keyboard style and sound-processing abilities, and Wilson's cinematic scope, as a declared fan of American filmmaker [[David Lynch]], whose films are renowned for their sonic content.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3724|title=KNAC.COM – Features – Interview With Porcupine Tree's Steven Wilson|date=25 June 2005|access-date=11 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081210070535/http://www.knac.com/article.asp?ArticleID=3724|archive-date=10 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/therealstevenwilson|title=Steven Wilson's MySpace|access-date=11 April 2008|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719095355/http://www.myspace.com/therealstevenwilson|archive-date=19 July 2008}}</ref> "Very layered, very produced, very arranged and [with] complex arrangements" is the way Wilson describes the sound of the band.<ref name="High Fidelity">{{cite web|url=http://www.highfidelityreview.com/features/porcupine_tree.asp |title=Porcupine Tree in Absentia DVD-Audio – Steven Wilson Interview |publisher=HighFidelityReview.com |date=7 March 2004 |access-date=8 April 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404160609/http://www.highfidelityreview.com/features/porcupine_tree.asp |archive-date=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Apart from their regular edition, the albums ''Stupid Dream'', ''Lightbulb Sun'', ''In Absentia'', ''Deadwing'', ''Fear of a Blank Planet'', and ''The Incident'' are available in [[Digital Theater System|DTS]] (5.1 Surround Sound) mix; this mixing technique has become a tradition for the band in recent years.

The band's live performances have also been praised, with [[Music Radar]] placing them fourth in their list of "The 30 greatest live acts in the world today" in 2010.<ref>[http://i775.photobucket.com/albums/yy35/synesthetize/NuevoLienzo.png Archive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326031043/http://i775.photobucket.com/albums/yy35/synesthetize/NuevoLienzo.png |date=26 March 2012 }}/[http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/the-30-greatest-live-acts-in-the-world-today-462684/28 Original]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917052448/http://www.musicradar.com/news/guitars/the-30-greatest-live-acts-in-the-world-today-462684/28 |date=17 September 2012 }}.

Porcupine Tree are often categorised as a progressive rock band. Although many listeners familiar with the group label them as such, Steven Wilson has been noted in the past to express a certain dislike for the use of the term "progressive" to refer to them.<ref name="Aural Innovations Issue No.7" /> However, more recently, he made note that he has since become more relaxed toward the word considering it is becoming "a much broader term"<ref name="ProgArchives"/> as time passes. He has frequently stated that he dislikes the press comparing Porcupine Tree with [[neo prog]] bands or citing them as 'the New Pink Floyd'. "For me that is so insulting," commented Wilson in an interview with the Dutch'' Progressive Rock Page'', "because it insinuates that you are living in the shadow of some other band. I particularly never wanted to be the new anybody, I just wanted to be the old Porcupine Tree, or the new Porcupine Tree."<ref name="DPRP Specials"/>

It’s a little bit like King Crimson, Tool and Trent Reznor, English-style, but not the same as any of those things. [...] Musically, what I really like about the band is they do a lot of odd time things that you don’t notice so much—they’re just in there. They fit together so well that they slide right past your ears, which is something some bands never attempt and when they do, it’s very obvious. Porcupine Tree also has really good players and the songs are really cool. I like everything about it. It’s just good stuff, custom-made for me.
