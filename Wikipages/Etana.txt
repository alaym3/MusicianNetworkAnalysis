'''Etana''' ([[Cuneiform]]:íÇäíã´íàæ, ''E.TA.NA'') was the probably fictional thirteenth king of the first dynasty of [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]]. He is listed in the ''[[Sumerian King List]]'' as the successor of [[Arwium]], the son of [[Mashda]], as king of Kish. The list also calls Etana "the shepherd, who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign countries", and states that he ruled 1,560 years (some copies read 635) before being succeeded by his son [[Balih]], said to have ruled 400 years. The kings on the early part of the ''SKL'' are usually not considered historical, except when they are mentioned in contemporary [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic]] documents. Etana is not one of them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marchesi|first=Gianni|date=2010|title=The Sumerian King List and the Early History of Mesopotamia|url=https://www.academia.edu/10052536|journal=M. G.

==Myth of Etana==
A [[Babylonian mythology|Babylonian]] legend says that Etana was desperate to have a child, until one day he helped save an eagle from starving, who then took him up into the sky to find the plant of birth. This led to the birth of his son, Balih.

In the detailed form of the legend, there is a tree with the eagle's nest at the top, and a serpent at the base. Both the serpent and eagle have promised [[Utu]] (the sun god) to behave well toward one another, and they share food with their children.

But one day, the eagle eats the serpent's children. The serpent comes back and cries. Utu tells the serpent to hide inside the stomach of a dead bull. The eagle goes down to eat the bull. The serpent captures the eagle, and throws him into a pit to die of hunger and thirst. Utu sends a man, Etana, to help the eagle. Etana saves the eagle, but he also asks the bird to find the plant of birth, in order to become father of a son. The eagle takes Etana up to the heaven of the god [[Anu]], but Etana becomes afraid in the air and he goes back to the ground. He makes another attempt, and finds the plant of birth, enabling him to have Balih.

So far versions in three languages have been found. The Old Babylonian version comes from [[Susa]] and [[Shaduppum|Tell Harmal]], the Middle Assyrian version comes from [[Assur]], and the Standard version is from [[Nineveh]].<ref>Dalley 189.</ref>

==Analysis==
Folklorist scholarship recognizes that the tale of Etana helping an eagle fits into the [[Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther Index|Aarne‚ÄìThompson‚ÄìUther]] tale type ATU 537, "The Eagle as helper: hero carried on the wings of a helpful eagle".<ref>Annus, Amar.
