===2000–2004: ''Since I Left You''===
{{main|Since I Left You}}
From mid-1998, the Avalanches had been recording their debut album, initially under the working title ''Pablo's Cruise''. In February 2000 they finished mixing it at Sing Sing Studios in [[Melbourne]]. Its initial launch date in 2000 was delayed due to the need for sample clearances and overseas interest.<ref name="Perrone"/> By July, with the album, now titled ''[[Since I Left You]]'', overdue, Chater's ''Gimix'' cassette was made available. This [[mixtape]] blended previews of forthcoming album tracks with some band favourites.

Seltmann broke his leg in [[Brisbane]] in an on-stage collision with bassist and singer Di Blasi.

In November 2000, ''Since I Left You'' was launched in Melbourne with a boat cruise party aboard the Victoria Star, through [[Port Phillip|Port Phillip Bay]], with [[The Face (magazine)|''The Face'']] and other UK media flying to Australia to cover the event. The band won six Australian Dance Music Awards. They travelled to the UK for a three-week promotional stint, including DJ&nbsp;sets at the Social and Fabric Nightclubs, while their remix of [[Badly Drawn Boy]]'s "The Shining" was released in the UK. ''Since I Left You'' contained numerous samples, including a sample of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]" on the track "Stay Another Season".<ref name="SinceILeftYou">{{cite AV media notes|title=Since I Left You|year=2000|type=booklet|publisher=[[Modular Recordings]]|id=MODCD009}}</ref><ref name="Schwartz">{{cite web|url=http://music.barnesandnoble.com/Since-I-Left-You/The-Avalanches/e/898926000422|title=''Since I Left You'' – The Avalanches|last1=Schwartz|first1=Mark|work=Editorial Reviews|publisher=[[Barnes & Noble]]|access-date=8 September 2011}}</ref>

==Live performances==
{{more citations needed section|date=June 2016}}
The Avalanches, initially, played live using samplers, analogue keyboards, bass guitar, drum kit, and [[theremin]].<ref name="soundonsound"/> Their set-up later included four turntables, a percussion stand, and a battery of [[MIDI controller|MIDI-controlled]] special effects.<ref name="soundonsound"/>

The band performed at festivals during 2000–2001, including the [[Big Day Out]], [[Falls Festival]] and [[V Festival|V1]]. For their European live tour, Peter "Snakey" Whitford was used as a touring percussionist, he had previously played in the Afro Psych band Prophecy throughout the [[Indonesia]]n islands. Seltmann broke his ankle during the band's [[Electric Ballroom]] show in London, while Dela Cruz suffered a concussion on-stage at the V2001 festival. The remaining live dates were [[DJ&nbsp;set]]s with Chater only. Despite this, the band eventually received the Best Live Act 2001 award from ''MUZIK'' magazine. This format continued for the United States and [[Japan]] Since I Left You Tours. Chater, Dela Cruz and Fabay also took the DJ&nbsp;show around Australia, calling themselves the Magic Midgets.

Brains was a monthly club-night held outdoors behind the tiny Melbourne bar St Jeromes', and featured regular DJ&nbsp;sets from the Avalanches' Chater, Seltmann and Di Blasi. St&nbsp;Jeromes' was shut down in March 2009. Their Brains' performances were usually [[Soca music|soca]]-inspired DJ sets, but included anything from the [[Highlife]] guitar music of West Africa to unusual re-edits of 1980s [[acid house]] tracks, and sometimes new Avalanches material. Far from a typical [[world music]] DJ&nbsp;set, the Brains' nights were extremely loud and celebratory, with people overflowing into Caledonian Lane, the band bringing in a special P.A.&nbsp;system to cope with the extra crowd. The Brains' experience toured Australia in early 2005, and spilled over into the band's DJ sets at that year's [[St Jerome's Laneway Festival]] and [[Meredith Music Festival]]. The Avalanches continued DJing at Australian festivals such as Golden Plains and [[Splendour in the Grass]] throughout 2006 and into 2007, although these sets were a return to a heavier, [[Electronic dance music|club sound]] and markedly different from the previous Brains' DJ sets.

The group returned to live performances in 2016, with a performance at Australian music festival [[Splendour in the Grass]]. Their live setup feature Chater on bass and Di Blasi on turntables, alongside guest musicians Paris Jeffree on drums, [[Spank Rock]] as MC, and Eliza Wolfgramm on vocals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/triplej/musicnews/s4506143.htm|title=What we thought of The Avalanches at Splendour 2016 {{!}} Music News {{!}} triple j|website=abc.net.au|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>
