</ref> was an American singer-songwriter best known for her 1975 single "[[Lovin' You]]" and her four octave  D3 to F#7 [[coloratura soprano]] range.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/jun/29/minnie-riperton-10-of-the-best|title= Minnie Riperton – 10 of the best|last= Chick|first= Stevie|date= June 29, 2016|website= Guardian.com|access-date=December 12, 2017}}</ref> She is also widely known for her use of the [[whistle register]] and has been referred to by the media as the "queen of the whistle register."{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

Born in 1947, Riperton grew up in [[Chicago]]'s [[Bronzeville, Chicago|Bronzeville]] neighborhood on the [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]]. As a child, she studied music, drama and dance at Chicago's Lincoln Center. In her teen years, she sang lead vocals for the Chicago-based girl group the Gems. Her early affiliation with the Chicago-based [[Chess Records]] afforded her the opportunity to sing backing vocals for various established artists such as [[Etta James]], [[Fontella Bass]], [[Ramsey Lewis]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Chuck Berry]] and [[Muddy Waters]]. While at Chess, Riperton also sang lead for the [[experimental rock]]/soul group [[Rotary Connection]], from 1967 to 1971.

On April 5, 1975, Riperton reached the apex of her career with her No. 1 single "Lovin' You". The single was the last release from her 1974 gold album titled ''[[Perfect Angel]]''. In January 1976, Riperton was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]], and in April, she underwent a [[radical mastectomy]].<ref name="ref1">{{cite episode|title= Unsung: The Minnie Riperton Story|network=Cable Network=TV-ONE|series=Unsung: The Minnie Riperton Story|airdate=June 7, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rockwell|first=John|date=May 11, 1977|title=Minnie Riperton: The octave lady composes songs, too|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLUsAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA4|work=[[Star-News|Wilmington Morning Star]]|page=7|access-date=March 26, 2019|quote="I had a mastectomy the day after Easter last year."}}</ref> By the time of [[diagnosis]], the cancer had [[metastasized]] and she was given about six months to live. Despite the grim [[prognosis]], she continued recording and touring. She was one of the first celebrities to go public with a breast cancer diagnosis, but she did not disclose that she was [[terminal illness|terminally ill]]. In 1977, she became a spokesperson for the [[American Cancer Society]]. In 1978, she received the American Cancer Society's Courage Award, which was presented to her at the White House by President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Riperton died of breast cancer on July 12, 1979, at the age of 31.

==Early life==
Riperton was born in Chicago, the daughter of Thelma Inez (née Matthews) (1911–2005) and Daniel Webster Riperton (1898–1991), a [[Pullman porter]].<ref>[http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/entertainment/blackmusicmonth/minnieriperton620] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705070522/http://www.blackamericaweb.com/site.aspx/entertainment/blackmusicmonth/minnieriperton620|date=July 5, 2007}}</ref><ref>Stated on ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', January 19, 2016, PBS</ref> The youngest of eight children in a musical family, she embraced the arts early. Although she began with [[ballet]] and modern dance, her parents recognized her vocal and musical abilities and encouraged her to pursue music and voice. At Chicago's [[Lincoln Center]], she received operatic vocal training from Marion Jeffery. She practiced breathing and [[Musical phrasing|phrasing]], with particular emphasis on diction. Jeffery also trained Riperton to use her full range. While studying under Jeffery, she sang [[operetta]]s and [[show tune]]s, in preparation for a career in opera. Jeffery was so convinced of her pupil's abilities that she strongly pushed her to further study the classics at Chicago's Junior Lyric Opera. The young Riperton was, however, becoming interested in [[soul music|soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], and [[rock and roll|rock]]. After graduating from Hyde Park High School (now [[Hyde Park Academy High School]]), she enrolled at [[Harold Washington College|Loop College]] and became a member of [[Zeta Phi Beta]] sorority. She dropped out of college to pursue her music career.

==Career==
===Early career===
Riperton's first professional singing engagement was with The Gems, when she was 15. Raynard Miner, a blind pianist, heard her singing during her stint with Hyde Park's [[A cappella|A Cappella]] Choir and became her musical patron. The Gems had relatively limited commercial success, but proved to be a good outlet for Riperton's talent. Eventually the group became a session group known as Studio Three and it was during this period that they provided the backing vocals on the classic 1965 [[Fontella Bass]] hit "[[Rescue Me (Fontella Bass song)|Rescue Me]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.msu.edu/~andrycoc/fontella.html |title=Sorry, We Can't Find That Page - Search MSU |publisher=Msu.edu |access-date=April 19, 2014}}</ref> In 1964, The Gems released a local hit, ''I Can't Help Myself'', and their last single, ''He Makes Me Feel So Good'', was released in 1965. The Gems later released records under numerous names—most notably 1966's ''Baby I Want You'' by the Girls Three and 1967's ''My Baby's Real'' by the Starlets. The latter has achieved cult status with [[northern soul]] fans and remains a favorite. It was a Motown-style song reminiscent of [[Tammi Terrell]]. In 1968, ''Watered Down'' was released as a follow-up, under the name The Starlets. It was the last release of Riperton's former girl group. While a part of Studio Three, Riperton met her mentor, producer [[Billy Davis (songwriter)|Billy Davis]], who wrote her first local hit, "Lonely Girl", as well as "You Gave Me Soul". In honor of Davis, she used the pseudonym Andrea Davis for the release of those two singles.

===Rotary Connection===
{{Main|Rotary Connection}}
In 1966, some months after her Andrea Davis singles hit the radio, Riperton joined [[Rotary Connection]], a [[funk]]y rock-soul group creation of [[Marshall Chess]], the son of [[Chess Records]] founder [[Leonard Chess]]. Rotary Connection consisted of Riperton, Chess, Judy Hauff, Sidney Barnes, and [[Charles Stepney]]. They released their debut album ''[[Rotary Connection (album)|Rotary Connection]]'' in 1967 and, subsequently, five more albums: 1968's ''Aladdin'' and Christmas album ''Peace'', ''[[Songs (Rotary Connection album)|Songs]]'' (1969),  ''Dinner Music'' (1970), and ''Hey Love'' (1971).

In 1969 Riperton, along with Rotary Connection, played in the first Catholic Rock Mass at the Liturgical Conference National Convention, Milwaukee Arena, [[Milwaukee, WI]], produced by [[James F. Colaianni]].

===''Come to My Garden''===
Riperton's debut solo album entitled ''[[Come to My Garden]]'' was produced, arranged, as well as orchestrated by her Rotary Connection band mate Charles Stepney and released in 1970 by GRT Records. Several of the songs were co-written by Stepney and [[Richard Rudolph]], who married Riperton in August 1970. She was presented as a solo artist by [[Ramsey Lewis]] on Saturday, December 26, 1970 at Chicago's famed [[The London House, Chicago|London House]]. Riperton went on to perform several numbers from the album while accompanied by Stepney. Although commercially unsuccessful, ''Come to My Garden'' is now considered a masterpiece by music critics and many others in the music industry.<ref name="ref1"/>

===''Perfect Angel'' and "Lovin' You"===
{{Main|Lovin' You}}
In 1973, a college intern for [[Epic Records]] found Riperton in semi-retirement. She had become a homemaker and a mother of two in [[Gainesville, Florida]]. After he heard a demo of the song "Seeing You This Way", the rep took the tape to Don Ellis, VP of [[A&R]] for Epic. Riperton signed with Epic Records, and the family moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. The subsequent record, ''[[Perfect Angel]]'', turned out to be one of Riperton's best-selling albums. Included were the rock-soul anthem "Reasons"; the second single, "Take a Little Trip" (written by Stevie Wonder, who also coproduced the album); and the third single, "Seeing You This Way".
Sales of the album started out slow. Epic was ready to move on to the next record, but Rudolph convinced them to release another single. With the fourth single, "Lovin' You", the album caught on, and in April 1975, the song went to the top of the charts in the U.S. and 24 other countries. The song reached no. 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], and number three on the U.S. R&B charts. It sold more than one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[RIAA]] in April 1975.<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

}}</ref> ''Perfect Angel'' went gold and Riperton was finally revered as the "lady with the high voice and flowers in her hair." The album also featured the song "Every Time He Comes Around", with [[Deniece Williams]] singing the background vocals.

===Later career===
After ''Perfect Angel'', Riperton and her husband, songwriter and music producer [[Richard Rudolph]] started on Riperton's third album, ''[[Adventures in Paradise (Minnie Riperton album)|Adventures in Paradise]]'' (1975). [[Joe Sample]] of [[The Crusaders (Houston group)|The Crusaders]] cowrote the title song, "Adventures in Paradise", and Crusaders producer [[Stewart Levine]] co-produced the album. While shooting a promotional clip for the album, she was attacked by a lion, but was not seriously injured. During an appearance on ''The Sammy Davis, Jr. Show'', she played the footage of the incident for Sammy and her fellow guests, including [[Richard Pryor]]. The album was a modest success. Despite the R&B hit "[[Inside My Love]]" (a no. 5 U.S. R&B hit, later covered by [[Trina Broussard]], [[Chanté Moore]], and [[Delilah (musician)|Delilah]]), the album did not match the success of ''Perfect Angel''. Some radio stations refused to play "Inside My Love" due to the lyrics: "Will you come inside me?"

Her fourth album for Epic Records, titled ''[[Stay in Love]]'' (1977), featured another collaboration with [[Stevie Wonder]] in the funky disco tune "Stick Together".

In 1978, Richard Rudolph and Riperton's attorney Mike Rosenfeld orchestrated a move to [[Capitol Records]] for Riperton and her CBS Records catalog. In April 1979, Riperton released her fifth and final album, ''[[Minnie (album)|Minnie]]''. "[[Minnie (album)|Memory Lane]]" was a hit from the album.

===Collaborations===
Riperton sang backup on Stevie Wonder's songs "Creepin'" from 1974's ''[[Fulfillingness' First Finale]]'' and "Ordinary Pain" from 1976's ''[[Songs in the Key of Life]]''. In 1977, she lent her vocal abilities to a track named "Yesterday and Karma", on [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s album, ''Osamu''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Osamu&nbsp;– Osamu Kitajima : Credits : AllMusic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/osamu-mw0000849567/credits}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Riperton was married to songwriter and music producer [[Richard Rudolph]] from August 1970 until her death in July 1979. Together, Riperton and Rudolph had two children; music engineer Marc Rudolph (b. 1968) and actress/comedian [[Maya Rudolph]] (b. 1972).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Robert E.|date=September 6, 1979|title=Minnie's Family Faces the Future With her Dreams|journal=Jet|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|volume=56|issue=255|pages=53–54|issn=0021-5996}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yn2aYTGaVQsC|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_Yn2aYTGaVQsC/page/n94 95]|quote=minnie riperton.|title=Ebony|first=Johnson Publishing|last=Company|date= October 1, 1979|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company|access-date= July 28, 2017|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> Maya Rudolph was a child when "[[Lovin' You]]" was recorded. According to the liner notes from Riperton's ''Petals'' compilation CD, the melody to "Lovin' You" was created as a distraction for Maya when she was a baby so Riperton and Richard Rudolph could spend time together. Near the end of the unedited "Lovin' You", Riperton sings "Maya, Maya, Maya".<ref name="ref1"/>

===Illness and death===
[[Image:Minnie Riperton grave.jpg|right|thumb|Riperton's grave at [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]]]]
On August 24, 1976, Riperton revealed on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' that she had undergone a [[mastectomy]] due to [[breast cancer]].<ref name="ref1"/> At the time of her diagnosis, Riperton found out her [[cancer]] had already spread to the [[lymphatic system]], and she was given about six months to live.<ref name="ref1"/> She continued touring in 1977 and 1978, and she became the national spokeswoman for the [[American Cancer Society]]'s 1978–79 campaign.<ref name="ref1"/> During the recording of her final album, ''Minnie'', her cancer progressed to the point that she was in a great deal of pain.<ref name="ref1"/> Extreme [[lymphedema]] immobilized her right arm in early 1979. In her final singing appearances on television (most notably on the ''[[Mike Douglas Show]]''), her right arm remained in a fixed position during her performances.<ref name="ref1"/> Near her death, in concert, she changed the end of "Lovin' You", "Maya, Maya, Maya" to "Maya, Maya, Ringo, Maya." Ringo was her nickname for her son, Marc.

By mid-June, Riperton was confined to bed. She entered [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] in Los Angeles on July 10. On Thursday, July 12 at 10:00 am, she died in the arms of her husband. That Sunday, following a funeral service attended by more than five hundred mourners, Riperton was interred in the [[Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Los Angeles]]. Her epitaph is the opening line of her most famous song: "Lovin' you is easy 'cause you're beautiful".

==Posthumous releases==
After Riperton died, several artists contributed vocals to tracks she had recorded before her death, to help compile Richard Rudolph's final tribute to his wife, ''[[Love Lives Forever]]''. Included, among others, were [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Stevie Wonder]]. Riperton's last single, "Give Me Time," was released in 1980. Richard Rudolph wrote the song, "Now That I Have You" for her, but she never got the chance to record it; he gave the song to [[Teena Marie]], who recorded it (and co-produced it with Rudolph) on Marie's second LP, ''[[Lady T (album)|Lady T]]''. Finally, in 1981, Capitol Records released ''[[The Best of Minnie Riperton]]'', a greatest hits collection. The "new" song on the album was a remake of [[Joni Mitchell]]'s "A Woman of Heart and Mind," which was a holdover from the ''[[Minnie (album)|Minnie]]'' sessions. Also included were an alternate mix of "Memory Lane"; live versions of "Can You Feel What I'm Saying," "Lover And Friend," and "Young, Willing, and Able"; and two "Moments with Minnie." It also included the hits "Perfect Angel," "Lovin' You," "Inside My Love," "Adventures In Paradise," and two tracks from ''Love Lives Forever'': the single "Here We Go" (a duet with [[Peabo Bryson]]),<ref name="apple">{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/love-lives-forever/714616058 |date=October 22, 1977 |access-date=May 22, 2017 |title=Love Lives Forever - Minnie Riperton |author=Apple Inc.}}</ref> and the song "You Take My Breath Away."
During the 1990s, Riperton's music was sampled by many rap and hip-hop artists, including [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Dr. Dre]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], [[Blumentopf]], [[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld|The Orb]] and [[Tragedy Khadafi]].<ref name="ref1"/>

==Vocal ability==
Riperton had a [[coloratura soprano]] vocal range.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=1335 |title=SoulMusic.com |publisher=SoulMusic.com |access-date=April 19, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322212510/http://www.soulmusic.com/index.asp?S=1&T=38&ART=1335 |archive-date=March 22, 2012 }}</ref> Aside from her various hits, she is perhaps best remembered today for her ability to sing in high [[head voice]] (occasionally the [[whistle register]] which is often mistakenly confused with the former), in which she had rare facility.<ref>{{cite book| last1= Bogdanov| first1= Vladimir| last2= Woodstra| first2= Chris| last3= Erlewine|first3=Stephen Thomas|title=All Music Guide To Rock: The Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul|edition=3|year=2002|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation| isbn= 0-87930-653-X|page=944}}</ref> She is known as The Nightingale, and a Songbird. Her rare ability to enunciate in the high registers set her apart from most other whistle-register singers. This feature is most notably heard in the song "Here We Go" (a duet with [[Peabo Bryson]]),<ref name="apple"/> where she sings "here we go" in the whistle register. Whistle-register enunciation can also be heard in songs such as "Inside My Love", "Adventures in Paradise", "Expecting", "Only When I'm Dreaming", and also in "Teach Me How to Fly" and "[[Like a Rolling Stone]]" with the [[Rotary Connection]].

Riperton was also noted for her ability to sound almost mechanical or instrumental in the high head voice and whistle. In "You Take My Breath Away", she sang a ''[[portamento]]'' ending two octaves above the staff. She has also been credited for her ability to sustain notes in the sixth and seventh octave for long periods, as in "Reasons", "Could It Be I'm in Love", "Adventures in Paradise", and "Inside My Love", and also "Love Me Now" with the Rotary Connection. Having an innate ability to imitate many instruments helped lead to Riperton's discovery while she was a secretary at Chess Records.

In her recordings, Riperton's highest recorded note reached in the whistle register was F<sub>7</sub> on the third scale of "You Take My Breath Away".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} Riperton reached this extremely high note before on an early recording of "Teach Me How to Fly" and "Could It Be I'm in Love". Also in a live performance of the song "Ruby Tuesday" from Rotary Connection, she sang an F{{sharp}}<sub>7</sub>. In the song "Lovin' You" she sings a [[walkdown]] on the [[A major]] scale from F{{sharp}}<sub>6</sub> to A<sub>5</sub>. [[Mariah Carey]] cited Riperton as an influence on her.<ref>{{cite interview| date= November 1998 |interviewer= Danyel Smith | first= Mariah| last= Carey| author-link= Mariah Carey| title= Higher and Higher| url= http://mariahcareynetwork.com/magazines/vibe98.html|  work= [[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]]| access-date= March 14, 2017}}</ref>

==Documentary and tributes==
[[Stevie Wonder]] paid tribute to Riperton during an episode of the TV show ''[[Soul Train]]'', which aired shortly after her death in September 1979.<ref>{{cite episode| url= http://www.tv.com/shows/soul-train/a-tribute-to-minnie-riperton-with-stevie-wonder-and-wintley-phipps-114047/ |title= A Tribue to Minnie Riperton with Stevie Wonder and Wintley Phipps| series= [[Soul Train]] |season= 9 |number= 1| date= September 15, 1979}}</ref>  She was also mentioned prominently in his song "Positivity" on ''[[A Time to Love (album)|A Time to Love]]'' (2005).

On June 7, 2009, TV One (US TV network's) ''[[Unsung (TV series)|Unsung]]'' series premièred a one-hour documentary on Riperton's career and life. It included interviews with her husband Richard, son Marc, daughter Maya, sister Sandra Riperton, and many others who worked with her.<ref name= ref1 />

Singer [[Julia Fordham]]'s song 'Roadside Angel' is a biographical tribute to Riperton.

Singer [[Kate Bush]] referenced Riperton ("Hello Minnie") in a lyric of "Blow Away", a track on her 1980 album ''[[Never for Ever]]''. The song also references several other musicians who had recently died.

Hip-hop trio [[Salt-N-Pepa]] included an illustration of a spiritual Riperton alongside [[Billie Holiday]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], and [[Louis Armstrong]] on the cover of their 1990 album ''[[Blacks' Magic]]''.
