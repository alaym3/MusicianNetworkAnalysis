Turner stated in her 1986 autobiography ''I, Tina'' that she was introduced to [[Nichiren Daishonin]] Buddhism by Ike Turner's friend, Valerie Bishop, who taught her the chant ''[[Nam Myōhō Renge Kyō|Nam-myoho-renge-kyo]]'' in 1973.{{Sfn|Turner|Loder|p=139|1986}}<ref name="worldtribune-turner">{{cite news|date=August 1, 2018|title=The Queen of Hope|work=Living Buddhism / World Tribune|publisher=[[Soka Gakkai International-USA]]|url=https://www.worldtribune.org/2018/07/queen-hope-tina-turner/|url-status=live|access-date=January 11, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180810235425/https://www.worldtribune.org/2018/07/queen-hope-tina-turner/|archive-date=August 10, 2018}}</ref> Turner later stated in her 2020 spiritual memoir ''[[Happiness Becomes You (book)|Happiness Becomes You]]'' that her son, Ronnie Turner, first suggested she might benefit from chanting.<ref>{{cite book |last=Turner |first=Tina |author-link=Tina Turner |date=2020 |title=Happiness Becomes You |url= |location= |publisher=Atria Books |page=19 |isbn=978-1-9821-5215-4}}</ref> Turner practiced Buddhism with her neighborhood Soka Gakkai International chanting group.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|date=2020-11-02|title=Tina Turner on 'Happiness Becomes You'|url=https://www.worldtribune.org/2020/11/tina-turner-on-happiness-becomes-you/|access-date=2021-07-17|website=World Tribune|language=en-US}}</ref> After chanting, Turner noticed positive changes in her life which she attributed to her newfound spiritual practice.

In the [[Soka Gakkai]] tradition, we are taught how to sing it. It is a sound and a rhythm and it touches a place inside you. That place we try to reach is the subconscious mind. I believe that is the highest place…".<ref name="Andrea Miller" /> Dramatizations of Turner chanting were included both in the 1993 film ''What's Love Got to Do with It'' and in the 2021 documentary film [[Tina (2021 film)|''Tina'']].

[[Daphne Brooks|Daphne A.

She catapulted herself to the forefront of a musical revolution that had long marginalized and overlooked the pioneering contributions of African American women and then remade herself again at an age when most pop musicians were hitting the oldies circuit. Turner's musical character has always been a charged combination of mystery as well as light, melancholy mixed with a ferocious vitality that often flirted with danger.</blockquote>
