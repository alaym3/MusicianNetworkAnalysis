'''Possessed''' is an American [[death metal]] band,{{r|metalinjection|BECERRA1}} originally formed in 1983. Noted for their fast style of playing and Jeff Becerra's [[death growl|growled vocals]], they are often called the first band in the death metal genre,<ref name="am">Many would however relate the Possessed sound to the old wave of Black Metal which was started by bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Hellhammer (band)|Hellhammer]] and [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5171|pure_url=yes}} Possessed band page, Eduardo Rivadavia, Allmusic]: "The brutal Seven Churches was arguably the first true death metal album and set the stage for the genre's breakaway from thrash."</ref> and paved the way for the 1980s [[Bay Area thrash metal]] scene, along with [[Metallica]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]] and [[Death Angel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://noisecreep.com/bay-area-thrash/|title=Bay Area Thrash Photographer Shares Vintage Shots of Metallica, Slayer|publisher=[[Noisecreep]]|date=February 15, 2012|access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.revolvermag.com/music/see-metallica-slayer-recall-80s-bay-area-thrash-scene-new-documentary-trailer|title=See Metallica, Slayer Recall 80s Bay Area Thrash Scene in New Documentary Trailer|publisher=[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]|date=March 20, 2019|access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://riffmagazine.com/features/murder-in-the-front-row/|title='Murder in the Front Row' documentary celebrates Bay Area thrash|publisher=Riff Magazine|date=March 31, 2019|access-date=January 9, 2021}}</ref> The band is also notable for featuring future [[Primus (band)|Primus]] guitarist [[Larry LaLonde]], who was the guitarist for Possessed from 1984 to 1987.

After breaking up in 1987, and reforming from 1990 to 1993, the band reformed again under original bassist and vocalist Jeff Becerra in 2007. Since its inception, Possessed has released three studio albums − ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]'' (1985), ''[[Beyond the Gates (Possessed album)|Beyond the Gates]]'' (1986) and ''[[Revelations of Oblivion]]'' (2019) − as well as one live album, two compilation albums and two EPs.

==History==
===Formation (1983)===
The band originated in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in 1983, when [[San Pablo, California|San Pablo]] and [[El Sobrante, California|El Sobrante]] residents Mike Torrao (guitar) and Mike Sus (drums) started a [[garage band]] with vocalist Barry Fisk and former [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]] bassist Jeff Andrews under the name Possessed. While the quartet had begun writing some music together, the line-up would be cut short when Fisk committed suicide by gunshot in front of his girlfriend's house in [[Tara Hills, California]], and Andrews subsequently opted not to participate in the group any longer.

{{stack|[[File:PinoleVHS.jpg|thumb|Pinole Valley High School, the [[alma mater]] of Jeff Becerra, Larry LaLonde, Danny Boland and Michael Miner]]}}

Meanwhile, bassist / vocalist Jeff Becerra had recently split with his band Blizzard in the neighboring city of [[Pinole, California|Pinole]]. That band included [[Larry LaLonde]] and Danny Boland on guitars and Michael Miner on drums, all of whom were [[high school]] students in the same graduating class. After being approached by Torrao and Sus, Becerra joined Possessed filling both the vacant vocal and bassist positions. The band had also placed an ad for a new guitarist which was answered by Brian Montana, and the second incarnation of Possessed was formed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/san+francisco/possessed|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104070326/http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+states/california/san+francisco/possessed|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 4, 2013|title=MusicMight :: Artists :: POSSESSED|date=November 4, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interview/possessed/|title=POSSESSED|website=Voices From The Darkside}}</ref>

===Initial career (1983–1987)===
Possessed spent 1983{{endash}}1984 practicing and working on their sound by performing at local venues and becoming an active part of the [[Bay Area thrash metal|Bay Area thrash]] scene. They recorded the 3-song demo ''Death Metal'' in 1984. After live shows with Metallica and Exodus, the latter group brought the band's demo recording to the attention of [[Brian Slagel]], head of [[Metal Blade Records]].<ref name="tg">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/bio/549/Possessed.html|title=The Gauntlet - Possessed bio|website=Thegauntlet.com|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=Possessed&cat=Metal&full=Possessed|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615091134/http://www.ugo.com/channels/music/features/bandsondemand/artist.aspx?artist=Possessed&cat=Metal&full=Possessed|url-status=dead|title=Possessed: Biography, Discography|archive-date=June 15, 2011}}</ref> Slagel showed interest in the band and offered to put their song "Swing of the Axe" on the upcoming compilation ''[[Metal Massacre#Metal Massacre VI – 1985|Metal Massacre VI]]''. Following the release of the compilation, guitarist Brian Montana left the band due to creative differences and was replaced by Blizzard guitarist [[Larry Lalonde]]. The band then hired [[Mechanics Bank]] heiress [[Debbie Abono]] (''nee'' Downer), mother of LaLonde's then-girlfriend, Julie, to  manage the band. 

The compilation drew the attention of [[Combat Records]] who signed the band and released their debut album ''[[Seven Churches (album)|Seven Churches]]'' in 1985,{{r|tg}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/alley/1409/possessed/phist.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011028010208/http://www.geocities.com/sunsetstrip/alley/1409/possessed/phist.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 28, 2001|title=Possessed History|date=October 28, 2001|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> with [[Roadrunner Records]] handling European distribution. 
In November of the same year, the band flew to [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada for the WWIII Weekend Festival in support of the Seven Churches release, playing alongside [[Celtic Frost]], [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] and [[Nasty Savage]]. The concert was Possessed's first and largest arena appearance, with nearly 7,000 in attendance.<ref>{{cite book| last = Christe| first = Ian| title = Sound of the beast: the complete headbanging history of heavy metal (page 142)| publisher = [[It Books]]| date = February 17, 2004| isbn = 0-380-81127-8| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/soundofbeastcomp0000chri}}</ref> Possessed followed the release with a supporting tour which included a performance with [[Slayer]] and [[Venom (band)|Venom]] at [[San Francisco]]'s [[Bay Area thrash metal#Kabuki Theatre, San Francisco|Kabuki]] in 1986.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metal-rules.com/where/Possessed.htm|title=Metal-Rules.com - Possessed: Where Are They Now?|access-date=October 8, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522211223/http://www.metal-rules.com/where/Possessed.htm|archive-date=May 22, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> 

On Halloween 1986, Possessed released their second album ''[[Beyond the Gates (Possessed album)|Beyond the Gates]]''. They embarked on a short European tour with [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]] and in the U.S. opening for [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]].<ref>{{cite web | date=1984-10-31 |title=Tour dates| url=https://www.metallipromo.com/po.html | access-date=2021-04-03}}</ref> In May 1987, the band issued a five-song EP produced by guitarist [[Joe Satriani]] titled ''[[The Eyes of Horror]]'' which marked a change in musical direction for the band. The Satanic themes they had become noted for were almost completely absent, and the songs had more of a [[thrash metal]] style than their earlier death metal sound. The song "Storm in My Mind" was written by Lalonde and the rest by Torrao, who had written most of the band's earlier material. Soon after the release, internal tensions among the band members led to their break up.

In 1989, Jeff Becerra was held up at gunpoint by two assailants and was shot twice, leaving him paralyzed from the chest down.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/possesseds-jeff-becerra-recounts-1989-armed-robbery-attempt-that-left-him-paralyzed-and-wheelchair-bound/|title=POSSESSED's JEFF BECERRA Recounts 1989 Armed Robbery Attempt That Left Him Paralyzed And Wheelchair-Bound|date=April 14, 2019|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=July 20, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/Interviews/POSSESSED--7051.html|title=Frank Stöver interviews Jeff Becerra|access-date=April 30, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630204831/http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/Interviews/POSSESSED--7051.html|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=BECERRA2>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/possessed-s-jeff-becerra-gives-revealing-interview/|title=POSSESSED's JEFF BECERRA Gives Revealing Interview|date=July 22, 2008|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>

===Reformations (1990–present)===
Mike Torrao formed an all new version of Possessed in 1990, taking over lead vocals himself, and recorded a two-song demo in 1991. Several different line-ups were attempted, and a four song demo was recorded in 1993, but the group failed to gain momentum and disbanded shortly after.

In 2007, it was announced Jeff Becerra would be performing under the "Possessed" name at the [[Wacken Open Air]] festival and would be backed by the members of [[Sadistic Intent]], one of the bands featured on the Possessed tribute album ''Seven Gates of Horror'' released in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Various-The-Seven-Gates-Of-Horror-A-Tribute-To-Possessed/release/1903793|title=The Seven Gates Of Horror - A Tribute To Possessed (2004, CD)|website=Discogs.com}}</ref> They would also headline the Gathering of the Bestial Legions III festival in [[Los Angeles]].  This same lineup also performed at [[Maryland Deathfest]] VIII in May 2010. After a U.S. tour with [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], Rick and Bay Cortez along with Ernesto Bueno returned to Sadistic Intent, while drummer [[Emilio Marquez]] remained.

By late 2012, Possessed had begun writing new material for their first full-length studio album since 1986's ''Beyond the Gates''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/possessed-working-on-new-music-barge-to-hell-performance-footage-posted-online/|title=POSSESSED Working On New Music; 'Barge To Hell' Performance Footage Posted Online|date=December 8, 2012|website=Blabbermouth.net|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> They had performed several new songs live which were expected to appear on the new album.

In 2017 the band signed a three album recording contract with [[Nuclear Blast Records]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/possessed-signs-with-nuclear-blast/|title=POSSESSED Signs With NUCLEAR BLAST|website=Blabbermouth.net|date=May 11, 2017|access-date=May 12, 2017}}</ref> By this time, the band consisted of Becerra and Marquez along with guitarists Daniel Gonzalez and Claudeous Creamer and bassist Robert Cardenas. Initially set for release in 2018, the bands third studio album ''[[Revelations of Oblivion]]'' was released on May 10, 2019, their first in 33 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=POSSESSED To Release Revelations Of Oblivion Album In May; Artwork, "No More Room In Hell" Visualizer Streaming|url=http://bravewords.com/news/possessed-to-release-revelations-of-oblivion-album-in-may-artwork-no-more-room-in-hell-visualizer-streaming|publisher=[[Brave Words & Bloody Knuckles]]|access-date=March 15, 2019|date=March 15, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.decibelmagazine.com/2019/03/15/possessed-to-release-revelations-of-oblivion-on-may-10/|title=Possessed to Release "Revelations of Oblivion" on May 10, Stream First Song|date=March 15, 2019|website=Decibel Magazine}}</ref> The album entered the [[UK Rock & Metal Singles and Albums Charts]] at #7 in its first week.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/rock-and-metal-albums-chart/20190517/112/|title=Official Rock & Metal Albums Chart Top 40 &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com}}</ref>

In a February 2021 interview,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5DfkpGQOhwI|title=Interview with Jeff Becerra!|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}</ref> vocalist Jeff Becerra stated that he will begin writing new material for the next Possessed album after the band finishes touring in support of ''Revelations of Oblivion''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=41020|title=Possessed - Planning To Write Another Album|publisher=[[Metal Storm (webzine)|Metal Storm]]|access-date=February 9, 2021|date=February 9, 2021}}</ref>

==Influences==
At least three Possessed members who had written and recorded with the band at some point (vocalist/bassist Becerra, guitarist Torrao and guitarist Montana) cite early Exodus and Venom as their main influences, in addition to [[NWOBHM]] acts like [[Motörhead]], [[Iron Maiden]], and [[Judas Priest]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/possessed.htm|title=POSSESSED interview - Jeff Becerra|website=Voicesfromthedarkside.de|access-date=July 20, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/montana.htm|title=POSSESSED interview - Brian Montana|website=Voicesfromthedarkside.de|access-date=July 20, 2021}}</ref> 
Although [[AllMusic]] attributed Slayer as being a musical influence for ''Seven Churches'',<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=album|id=r15558|pure_url=yes}} allmusic(((Seven Churches > Overview)))]</ref> the first Slayer album ''[[Show No Mercy (Slayer album)|Show No Mercy]]'' had not been released until December 1983, shortly after members of Possessed were already writing material for their demo and debut album. Lyrically, most of Possessed's songs focused on [[Satanism]] and [[death]].

Possessed are often cited as the first death metal band, largely because of the early use of [[death grunt|grunted vocals]], ultra-fast [[drums|drumming]] and guitar [[tremolo picking]] as previously noted. In the 2004 book, ''[[Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore]]'', Jeff Becerra staked claim to creating the "death metal" [[nomenclature]] in 1983.<ref>{{cite book |last = John Peel |author-link = John Peel | first = Albert Mudrian| title = Choosing Death: The Improbable History of Death Metal and Grindcore| publisher = [[Feral House]]| year = 2004| isbn = 1-932595-04-X}}</ref> The band's efforts on [[Seven Churches (album)|''Seven Churches'']] have been called an influence by groups like [[Death (metal band)|Death]], [[Pestilence (band)|Pestilence]], [[Sepultura]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Morbid Angel]], [[Cannibal Corpse]], [[Gorguts]], [[Sinister (band)|Sinister]], [[Vader (band)|Vader]], [[God Dethroned]] and [[Amon Amarth]], the latter five bands having appeared on a 2004 Possessed tribute album.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.karmageddonmedia.com/|title=KarmageddonMedia - Tech nyheder på nettet|website=Karmageddonmedia.com|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/vandrunen2.htm|title=PESTILENCE interview - Martin Van Drunen|access-date=February 18, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802094850/http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/vandrunen2.htm|archive-date=August 2, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metal-discovery.com/Interviews/pestilence_interview_2009_pt2.htm|title=Metal Discovery: Interview with Patrick Mameli (Pestilence) - 12th April 2009|website=Metal-discovery.com|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref> Possessed's “The Exorcist” had been covered earlier by Cannibal Corpse on the 1993 ''[[Hammer Smashed Face]]'' EP.

[[Chuck Schuldiner]], who had relocated his band Death to the Bay Area to write ''[[Scream Bloody Gore]]'' with [[Chris Reifert]], in tandem with Possessed's rise, told magazine ''[[Metal Maniacs]]'':

{{cquote|Possessed was different from all the other bands who were coming out at that time. They weren't pure noise, and they attempted to incorporate a lot of different musical ideas into their songwriting, not just rehash the same thing. They were into progressing as a band, which paved the way for other groups to expand their sound and do different things.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ian Christe| author-link = Ian Christe| title = Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal (page 115)| publisher = [[Harper Paperbacks]]| year = 2004| isbn = 0-380-81127-8| title-link = Sound of the Beast: The Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal}}</ref>}}

In the book ''Choosing Death'', Mantas/Death drummer [[Kam Lee]] called Possessed the first death metal band, and added:

{{cquote|When we were in Mantas, (Chuck Schuldiner, [[Rick Rozz]] and myself) still had a more Venom/Motörhead sound kinda going on. And then I remember Chuck getting the Possessed demo, and I just remember hearing it and just freaking out like, 'Man, this is the way we gotta be.' <ref>

Author Daniel Ekeroth expanded on Lee's assessment of the 1984 ''Death Metal'' demo in his book, ''Swedish Death Metal'':

{{cquote|Unlike virtually all other contemporary bands, Possessed left the Venom/Motörhead touches behind, creating "symphonic" tunes, and combining loads of complex riffs and drum patterns with the rawest sounds and fastest paces imaginable...Becerra took his vocal style one step beyond anything the world had heard before, as he seemed to scream and grunt at the same time. All these ideas would later be considered trademarks of death metal, and Possessed's demo has since generally been considered the first pure death metal recording.<ref>

Possessed's association with [[Debbie Abono]] would be a "first" for both sides: Abono would be the band's first manager, and Possessed were Abono's first managed signed band.

While Possessed's first album, ''Seven Churches'', was praised for its speed and the brutality of the vocals, the second album, ''[[Beyond the Gates (Possessed album)|Beyond the Gates]]'', disappointed both fans and critics alike.

Vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra continues to play a role in the death, [[black metal|black]], and thrash metal scenes. He received a degree in labor studies and plans to attend law school. He revamped the band in 2007.

In 1993, drummer Mike Sus retired from music to pursue other careers, going on to get a degree in [[psychology]] and is helping injured people to live a normal everyday life. He is also a drug addiction counselor.<ref name="mr">{{Cite web |url=http://www.metal-rules.com/where/Possessed.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 8, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522211223/http://www.metal-rules.com/where/Possessed.htm |archive-date=May 22, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Guitarist Larry LaLonde joined the Bay Area thrash metal band [[Blind Illusion]] which released ''[[The Sane Asylum]]'' in 1988, after which Lalonde with Blind Illusion bassist [[Les Claypool]] went on to form the influential [[funk metal]] band Primus in 1989.{{r|tg}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/1409/possessed/pwhere.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021112205443/http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Alley/1409/possessed/pwhere.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2002|title=Where Are They Now?|date=November 12, 2002|access-date=November 19, 2019}}</ref>

In 1995, guitarist Mike Torrao joined a new death metal band, Infanticide, but never released any songs to the public. Infanticide broke up in 1997.  He has since worked as a landscaper and plays music only in his spare time. As of 2008, Mike Torrao is working with the band INaCAGE<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.inacage.com/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=December 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180805063253/http://inacage.com/ |archive-date=August 5, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> in the San Francisco Bay Area.{{r|mr}}
