==History==

===2008: Career beginnings and formation===

In February 2008, [[Nate Ruess]]'s former band [[the Format]] split up. Immediately afterwards, Nate Ruess asked Andrew Dost and Jack Antonoff to join his new project. Dost had toured with the Format and provided various instrumentation, and Ruess met Antonoff after the Format toured with Steel Train.<ref>[http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=467591 Introducing: Fun.]. Retrieved June 11, 2010.</ref> The three began working together in [[New Jersey]] within a week.  Ruess sang melodies while the other two provided music for them.<ref name="about">{{cite web |title=About - Fun |url=http://ournameisFun.com/about |access-date=November 24, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505083735/http://www.ournameisfun.com/about |archive-date=May 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The first demo song the band recorded was "Benson Hedges", which was made available free in ''[[Spin magazine|Spin]]'''s August 20, 2008 article on the band.<ref>Kiser, Matt.

Retrieved 2008-09-19.</ref> In November 2008, fun embarked on their first tour opening for [[Jack's Mannequin]]. Their first show was played in Denver, Colorado on November 5, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/archive_4628|title=Jack's Mannequin to play entire new album on fall tour - News - Alternative Press|website=[[Alternative Press (magazine)]]|date=September 3, 2008}}</ref>  A couple of early demos and covers from other bands were performed. Fun then approached Steven McDonald, who produced [[the Format]]'s album ''[[Dog Problems]]'' with Ruess, to produce their debut album. McDonald was enthusiastic about the project and stated, "I can’t believe what we’re working on here. This crushes anything I’ve ever done."<ref name="about"/>

===2009–2010: ''Aim and Ignite''===
Recording took place in the fall of 2008. The band's first single, "At Least I'm Not as Sad As I Used to Be" was made available as a free download on the band's [[Myspace]] page on April 6, 2009.<ref name="AtLeast">{{cite web |title=Dear You: Letter from Nate + new song! |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendId=402387619&blogId=481510377 |date=April 6, 2009 |work=Fun.'s MySpace Blog |access-date=November 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=February 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''Aim and Ignite'' was released on August 25, 2009 and received positive reviews. [[AbsolutePunk.net]]'s Drew Beringer praised the album, stating it was "what a pop album 'should' sound like" and "the most essential pop album of 2009."<ref name="absolutepunk">{{cite web |last=Beringer |first=Drew |title=Fun. - Aim & Ignite - Album Review |url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=1215392 |date=July 25, 2009 |work=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=November 23, 2009}}</ref> [[Allmusic]] called the album "progressive, but in the best possible way" and admired Ruess's lyrics for "investigating the larger truths of life...with a witty approach that keeps the songs bubbling merrily along on a positive note".<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |last=Poet |first=J. |title=allmusic ((( Aim and Ignite > Review )))

She praised songs "Be Calm" and "The Gambler", but criticized the lyrics and production of the album's early tracks. Hung concluded that while ''Aim and Ignite'' is "pretty original to say the least", it "fails to live up to the Format’s last outing."<ref name="popmatters">{{cite web |last=Hung |first=Estella |title=Fun.: Aim and Ignite < Reviews |url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/115738-Fun.-aim-and-ignite/ |date=November 18, 2009 |work=PopMatters |access-date=November 23, 2009}}</ref> Popdose's Ken Shane called the album "an interesting and unusual listen." Shane applauded the album's songwriting and said "many of the songs are really good," but he objected to the "cute" production, desiring to hear the band "in a more stripped-down form." He ended his review with: "I have a similar problem with Dr. Dog, a band that was recommended to me by a number of people. I think much of their recorded work is too fussed over, but when I saw them live and their sound was more stripped down out of necessity, emphasizing their powerful songwriting, I thought they were wonderful. Perhaps the same fate awaits me with Fun."<ref>{{cite web |last=Shane |first=Ken |title=CD Review: Fun., "Aim and Ignite" |url=http://popdose.com/cd-review-fun-aim-and-ignite/ |date=August 27, 2009 |work=Popdose |access-date=November 23, 2009}}</ref> In reviewing the album, ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called some of the arrangements "theatrical, much like those on [[Panic! at the Disco]]'s [[A Fever You Can't Sweat Out|2005 debut]]".<ref>Dunham, Nancy (September 18, 2009).

The group performed at the [[55th Grammy Awards]], held February 10, 2013.  ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' predicted that "We Are Young" would bring home the Grammy in the categories [[Record of the Year]] and [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] (writing, of the latter, "'We Are Young' is the kind of anthem this category is made for"), and that ''Some Nights'' would win for [[Best Pop Vocal Album]]. "We Are Young" won the Grammy for Song of the Year and was nominated for Record of the Year. Fun also won the Grammy for [[Best New Artist]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=''EW''{{'s}} Grammy Picks |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=February 8, 2013 |location=New York |page=26|title-link=Grammy Award }}</ref> Ruess, after winning for "We Are Young", jokingly said, "I don't know what I was thinking, writing the chorus for this song.

In 2014, the band announced they are working on writing new material for an upcoming and unnamed album, however there was no time frame. On June 18, 2014, Fun performed a new song "Harsh Light" on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]''. This song was later released on Nate Ruess' solo album, ''[[Grand Romantic]]''.

On February 4, 2015, the band announced on its Facebook page and their official website that they are not splitting up, but are taking some time off to pursue other projects: 
<blockquote>First and foremost, to answer the question that has been raised most often: Fun is not breaking up. Fun was founded by the 3 of us at a time when we were coming out of our own bands. One thing that has always been so special about Fun is that we exist as 3 individuals in music who come together to do something collaborative. We make Fun records when we are super inspired to do so. Currently, Nate is working on his first solo album, Andrew is scoring films, and Jack is on tour and working on [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]] music. The 3 of us have always followed inspiration wherever it leads us. Sometimes that inspiration leads to Fun music, sometimes it leads to musical endeavors outside of Fun. We see all of it as part of the ecosystem that makes Fun, fun.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ournameisfun|title=FUN - Facebook|publisher=FUN}}</ref></blockquote>

Ruess' debut solo album, ''Grand Romantic'', was released on June 15, 2015.
