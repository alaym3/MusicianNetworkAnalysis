==Early life==
Born in [[New York City]], Krieger grew up in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]] and [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County, New York]] and attended school at the [[Scarborough School]] in [[Scarborough, New York]].<ref name="Krieger">{{cite news|last=Buckley|first=Michael|title=Stage to Screens: "Dreamgirls" Composer Krieger and Co-Star Rose; Plus David Warren|url=http://www.playbill.com/features/article/stage-to-screens-dreamgirls-composer-krieger-and-co-star-rose-plus-david-wa-137104|access-date=January 19, 2015|publisher=Playbill, Inc.|date=December 17, 2006}}</ref> There he played in [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[Iolanthe]]'' and ''[[Ruddigore]]''.  He became interested in theatre and the dramatic arts, and he later studied creative and liberal arts at the [[American University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Columbia University]] in New York, and then he studied Graphical Arts in [[Pontifical Xavierian University]] in [[Bogotá]], [[Colombia]].

==Career==
While still in his twenties, Krieger began composing for [[Off-Off-Broadway]].  Eyen and Krieger first worked together on the 1975 musical version of Eyen's revue ''[[The Dirtiest Show in Town]]'', called ''The Dirtiest Musical in Town''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_198/oscardreaming.html |title=''The Dirtiest Musical in Town'' is mentioned in this article on Krieger |access-date=2007-02-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061637/http://thevillager.com/villager_198/oscardreaming.html |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  [[Nell Carter]]'s performance in that musical inspired Krieger and Eyen to craft a musical about black [[backup singer]]s, which they workshopped for [[Joe Papp]] but shelved when Carter dropped out in 1978 to appear in ''[[Ryan's Hope]]''. A year later, the project caught the interest of Broadway director/producer/choreographer [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]], who sponsored a workshop production of ''Big Dreams'', as the musical was then known, with [[Loretta Devine|Devine]] and twenty-year-old gospel singer [[Jennifer Holliday]] as Carter's replacement. After several workshops, numerous rewrites and various roadblocks,<ref>Hill, Jeremy. "Pre-Broadway. ''Dreamgirls: Your Virtual Coffee Table Book of the Musical''.</ref> the show, now called ''Dreamgirls'', came to Broadway in 1981. It was a success, and was nominated for thirteen [[Tony Awards]] (including Best Score), winning six.  One of its songs, "[[And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going]]" became a top hit, and others became popular songs.  The [[Dreamgirls: Original Broadway Cast Album|original cast album]] won Krieger a Grammy Award.

Two years later, in 1983, Krieger's musical ''The Tap Dance Kid'', with lyrics by [[Robert Lorick]], opened at Broadway's [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and went on to win two Tony Awards.

Nearly 15 years later, his next Broadway musical, ''Side Show'', with book and lyrics by [[Bill Russell (lyricist)|Bill Russell]], opened at the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] in 1997.  ''Side Show'' received four Tony nominations, including Best Score.

In 2000, Krieger's musical ''Everything's Ducky'', again with Russell, opened at [[TheatreWorks (Silicon Valley)|TheatreWorks]] in [[Palo Alto, California]]. The show won the 2000 Backstage West Garland Award for Best Score as well as the Will Glickman Award for Best New Bay Area Play of 2000.  The musical has since had productions in St. Louis, Cincinnati, La Mirada, and Chicago.  The musical was later revised and retitled to ''Lucky Duck'', debuting at the [[Boston Conservatory]].

Krieger collaborated with Russell again on ''Kept'', based on [[Alexandre Dumas, fils]]' classic, ''[[The Lady of the Camellias|Camille]]''.  ''Kept'' premiered at TheatreWorks in 2002.  Krieger and Russell also wrote "Santa's Gonna Rock and Roll", which would serve as opening number of the ''[[Radio City Music Hall]] Christmas Spectacular'' for over a decade, and also "Take the Flame," for the opening and closing ceremonies of [[Gay Games]] IV.

In 2002, Krieger also wrote the score for ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]'''s television version of ''Sleeping Beauty'', with lyrics by [[Susan Birkenhead]].

When the [[Dreamgirls (film)|film version of ''Dreamgirls'']] was released in 2006, the soundtrack became a number one album, and Krieger's songs from the soundtrack became hits again. Krieger wrote four new songs for the film version, and he had the distinction of being [[79th Academy Awards|nominated]] for the [[Academy Award]] for Best Original Song three times in one year, for three of the songs: "[[Listen (Beyoncé Knowles song)|Listen]]", "[[Love You I Do]]", and "[[Patience (Dreamgirls song)|Patience]]".

With Birkenhead, he contributed two songs to ''Hats!'', the 2007 musical [[revue]] of the [[Red Hat Society]].

In 2008, he wrote the music for the musical ''Romantic Poetry'', which features a book and lyrics by [[John Patrick Shanley]]. The musical premiered at [[Manhattan Theatre Club]] at New York City Center in October 2008 and featured a cast that includes Jeb Brown, Jerry Dixon, Ivan Hernandez, Mark Linn Baker, [[Patina Miller]], and Emily Swallow. According to press notes, "Connie of Woodmere has just married Fred of Newark, but her exes are back in the picture and not sure they approve of the union. Mary of Greenpoint climbs Frankie of Little Italy's fire escape with amorous erotic intent – but things go awry as she reaches for her dream."

Krieger teamed up once again with Bill Russell to write the song "We Have to Change" for ''Spare Some Change: NYC Artists for Barack Obama'' on August 11, 2008 in New York City. The song was performed by [[Michael-Leon Wooley]].<ref name="Jon-MarcMcDonald We Have To Change">[http://www.bakeittilyoumakeit.com/the_red_bucket_diaries/2008/08/when-you-wish-u.html BITYMI website "When You Wish Upon a Frog", accessed Oct 20 2008]</ref><ref name=WEHavetoChangeVideo>{{YouTube|W1EZkOQjghU|Video "We Have to Change, accessed Oct 20 2008}}</ref><ref name="DailyKos We Have To Change">[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/9/5/63752/56181 DailyKos We Have To Change, accessed Oct 20, 2008]</ref>
