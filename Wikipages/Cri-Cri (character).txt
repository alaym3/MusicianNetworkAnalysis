Cri-Cri is known as the "grillito cantor" or "the singing cricket". He was created by Gabilondo Soler in his childhood and may even be considered "his inner personality".

The character became so famous and gave its author such renown, that it became a second name for Gabilondo.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FForAQAAIAAJ&q=%22cri-cri%22+cartoon|title=Cartooning in Latin America|last=Lent|first=John A.|date=2005-09-30|publisher=Hampton Press|isbn=978-1-57273-560-6|language=en}}</ref> In the mid part of the 20th century he became the most recognizable singer of children's songs in Spanish. Gabilondo's dedication to this segment of the population has been greatly admired, comparable to Walt Disney in his honest approach to making life fun for those who are beginning to live it.

== Legacy ==
[[Walt Disney]] himself saw the popularity and honesty in Soler's character, and approached Soler to purchase the rights for Cri-Cri. Soler declined, telling Disney that Cri-Cri was a legacy for Mexican children to cherish. Disney offered to animate one of Cri-Cri's most popular songs "Cochinitos Dormilones" (Sleepy Piggies),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://remezcla.com/features/music/cri-cri-el-grilito-cantor-op-ed/|title=Cri-Cri El Grillito Cantor is Beloved, But It Has a Problematic Past}}</ref> and incorporated aspects of his own ''[[Three Little Pigs (film)|Three Little Pigs]]'' [[short film|short]] into it.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhxoDonN5Jk<nowiki/> {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104191139/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhxoDonN5Jk |date=2015-11-04 }}</ref> In time, Walt Disney created [[Jiminy Cricket]], inspired by the famous Mexican character.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.merca20.com/15-curiosidades-de-cri-cri-en-su-105-aniversario/ | title=15 curiosidades de Cri-Cri en su 105 aniversario &#124; Revista Merca2.0 &#124;| date=2012-10-06}}</ref>
