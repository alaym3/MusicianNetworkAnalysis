'''Bi-2''' ({{lang-ru|Би-2}} ''Bi-dva'') is a [[Belarus|Belarusian]] [[alternative rock]] band, formed in the 1980s in [[Bobruisk]], Belarus. It was one of the most successful with many sales and chart-hits in [[Russia]]. Bi-2 was awarded [[MTV Russian Music Awards]] for Best Rock Act in 2007.

==History==
===Pre-history===
The band was formed in 1985 in [[Minsk]], Belarus, by two teenagers, Aleksandr "Shura" Uman and Egor "Lyova" Bortnik, who were amateur actors. Initially, the band's name was "Bratya po Oruzhiyu" (Brothers in Arms), which was formed in 1988, then "Bereg Istini" (Shore of Truth), which resulted in abbreviation BI-2. This word Lyova and Shura begun to use as their scenic names, and Shura eventually changed his passport surname to Bi-II.

In the beginning of the 90s the two moved to [[Israel]] and as [[Jews]] received citizenship, but in 1993 Shura moved to [[Australia]] while Lyova remained and served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. In 1994 Shura formed a romantic and professional relationship with pianist and artist ''Victoria Bilogan'' https://victoriabiloganart.com/ and in 1997 they recorded their first album "''Bespolaya i Grustnaya Lubov''". During this time, Lyova and Shura continued to compose music together, exchanging their records and tabs via [[Internet]] and phone. Before forming Chiron, Shura collaborated with Dee Ellus, his first English lyricist, in 1993 and 1994. Shura, together with Dino Molinaro and Michael Aliani, former members of [[Ikon (Australian band)|Ikon]], formed the [[darkwave]] band Chiron. In 1998 Leva moved to Australia and joined Chiron as well, but the two left the project in less than two years to continue with their own band.

===Modern history===
In 1999 Bi-2 moved to Russia, where they previously tried to release their already recorded album "Bespolaya i Grustnaya Lubov" (Asexual and Sad Love, 1998), but their plans were ruined by the [[1998 Russian financial crisis|Russian financial crisis of 1998]], which affected the record business. In 1999, the band consisted only of two men, but the lineup soon was increased by sessional musicians. The band went up to popularity only in 2000, recording the score for popular [[Brother 2]] movie by [[Aleksei Balabanov]]. Several score songs, included in the Bi-2 eponymous debut album, shook rock radio charts, including the influential [[Nashe Radio]] chart.

Bi-2 continued with "Meow Kiss Me" (2001) and "Inomarki" (2004), both sold gold in Russia. Each of their albums included duet records with other rock musicians from such bands as [[Splean]], [[Chaif]], [[Nochniye Snaiperi]], [[Zemfira]], and others. Videos for Bi-2 songs often appear on [[MTV Russia]]. In 2005 the double CD "Nechetny Voin" was released, which  consists completely of duets and collaborations.
