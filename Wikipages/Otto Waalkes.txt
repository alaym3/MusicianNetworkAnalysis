'''Otto Gerhard Waalkes''' (born 22 July 1948) is a German comedian, actor, and musician. He became famous in the 1970s and 1980s in Germany with his shows, books and films. His best known trademark are the 'Ottifanten' ('Ottiphants'), elephant-like comic characters of his own design. They featured on the cover of his first album release.<ref>von Gehlen, Dirk (8 November 2006). [https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2006/nov/08/themanwhobeatborat Who is Otto Waalkes?]. ''guardian.co.uk'' [[The Guardian]] News and Media Limited.</ref><!-- yes, blog, but per WP:RS, it's a RS publisher with editorial policy and a fact-check staff, hence, an acceptable source -->

Waalkes also works as a voice actor, providing the German voices of [[Mushu]] in Disney's ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', [[Sid the Sloth]] in the ''[[Ice Age (franchise)|Ice Age]]'' franchise, and the [[Grinch]] in ''[[The Grinch (film)|The Grinch]]'', among others.

== Life ==

Waalkes was born as the second son of Karl Waalkes, a master painter, and his wife Adele (born Lüpkes). Together with his older brother Karl-Heinz, he grew up in the working-class district ''Transvaal'' in [[Emden]].<ref name=":0">{{cite web |title=Alles zum Thema: Otto Waalkes - GQ |url=http://www.gq-magazin.de/tags/w/otto-waalkes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924023552/http://www.gq-magazin.de/tags/w/otto-waalkes |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 September 2015 |date=24 September 2015}}</ref> His parents were deeply religious Baptists and members of the Evangelic Free Church community of Emden, which taught a Bible-class that Waalkes visited regularly. He made his first public performance at the age of eleven years in a shopping mall in Emden, where he presented songs, including the ''Babysitter Boogie'', a German version of the [[Baby Sittin' Boogie]]. He was awarded with a voucher of 30 [[Deutschmark]] and the book [[Mutiny on the Bounty]]. When Waalkes was twelve years old, he received his first guitar. In 1964, he performed for the first time in the area of Emden with his band ''The Rustlers'', mainly covering songs by [[the Beatles]]. Waalkes was the front of the band, being the lead singer and the lead guitarist simultaneously. He toured with his band in the regions of [[Eastern Friesland]] for five years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Zeitung |first1=Badische |title=Otto Waalkes: Der Friesenjung - Panorama - Badische Zeitung |url=https://www.badische-zeitung.de/deutschland-1/der-friesenjung--3571783.html |website=www.badische-zeitung.de |language=de}}</ref>

In 1968, Waalkes passed his final exams ([[Abitur]]) at a boys' grammar school in Emden. After having failed to obtain a university place in ''Freie Malerei'' ("free art studies"), he started to study art education at the [[University of Fine Arts of Hamburg]] in 1970, although he never pursued a teaching profession.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |last1=Geyer |first1=Steven |title=Jetzt mal im Ernst … |url=https://www.fr.de/panorama/jetzt-ernst-11547458.html |website=Frankfurter Rundschau |language=de |date=1 July 2009}}</ref> Among others, he was taught by Hans Thiemann, a German painter.

Waalkes' first stage performance took place in ''Danny's Pan'', a folklore club in Hamburg where people could perform for ten minutes after having paid five Deutschmark. He lived in a commune named ''Villa Kunterbunt'' (German for [[Villa Villekulla]]) together with 14 roommates in [[Hamburg]]. Two of his roommates were [[Udo Lindenberg]] and [[Marius Müller-Westernhagen]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Lindenberg stellt Lindenberg aus |url=https://www.stern.de/kultur/kunst/galerie-eroeffnung-lindenberg-stellt-lindenberg-aus-3323256.html |website=stern.de |language=de |date=15 October 2006}}</ref>

Waalkes kept performing smaller gigs with his guitar in clubs of Hamburg to finance his studies. He cracked some jokes alongside to his songs and apologized whenever he accidentally dropped the microphone due to his nervousness. Over time, his apologies became more popular than his music, so his comedic stage show started to evolve. The clubs where he performed became gradually bigger – suddenly they were not merely named [[Onkel Pö]] but [[Westfalenhalle]].<ref name=":1" />

In 1972, Waalkes met his later manager Hans Otto Mertens. In the same year, he performed his first big concert with his band The Rustlers in Hamburg, which he recorded live at his own charge. He also founded the label ''Rüssl Räckords'' with Mertens, because no other record label wanted to publish the live records of Waalkes' performance. His album ''LP Otto'' was published in the same year and was sold over 500,000 times.

Waalkes is a survivor of the [[MGM Grand Fire]] on 21 November 1980. He was residing on the 26th floor during the accident and was evacuated by firefighters during the rescue efforts.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL0uYfYsbHU&t=774s</ref>

Waalkes was married to Manuela "Manu" (born Ebelt) from 1987 to 1999. In 1987, his son Benjamin Karl Otto Gregory was born.<ref name=":0" />

In 2000, Waalkes married Eva Hassmann in [[Jork]], an actress born in 1972.<ref>{{cite web |last1=SPIEGEL |first1=DER |title=Heimliche Hochzeit: Otto Waalkes und Eva Hassmann - DER SPIEGEL - Panorama |url=https://www.spiegel.de/panorama/heimliche-hochzeit-otto-waalkes-und-eva-hassmann-a-91915.html |website=www.spiegel.de |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=6 November 2011|title=Ehe-Aus bei Otto Waalkes und Eva Hassmann|language=de|work=[[Die Welt]]|url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/prominente/article13701824/Ehe-Aus-bei-Otto-Waalkes-und-Eva-Hassmann.html|access-date=6 November 2011}}</ref> According to their own statement, they had an [[open marriage]] and often lived in different places.<ref>{{cite news |title=Komiker: Otto Waalkes führt mit seiner Frau eine offene Ehe |newspaper=Die Welt |url=https://www.welt.de/vermischtes/prominente/article8557863/Otto-Waalkes-fuehrt-mit-seiner-Frau-eine-offene-Ehe.html |date=21 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Zeitung |first1=Süddeutsche |title=Schluss mit lustig |url=https://www.sueddeutsche.de/leben/vip-klick-otto-waalkes-schluss-mit-lustig-1.1182815 |website=Süddeutsche.de |language=de}}</ref>

== Career ==
[[File:Otto Waalkes 4528.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.85|Waalkes in 2005]]
Waalkes' humor consists of puns and word plays as well as the use of silly and funny language, noises and body language. Parodies, for instance in form of popular songs that he revises and presents with his guitar, are typical stylistic elements. Additionally, he often imbeds satire, political innuendos and critique of time and society into his humorous performances.

His ''Otto-Bücher'' (Otto-books) are regularly published and his ''Otto-Langspielplatten'' (Otto-long-playing records) became bestsellers, whereby many records attained top spots in musical charts and shops.

Waalkes is counted among the entertainers that have influenced the general use of language. A considerable part of this refers back to his early performances, where he mainly used texts of the [[New Frankfurt School]]. For example, the sentence ''"Hast du mal 'ne Zigarette? Meine Schachtel steckt noch im Automaten!"'' (''"Do you have a cigarette? My pack is still in the machine!"'') was firstly introduced by Waalkes. The set phrase ''"Einen hab' ich noch!"'' (''"I've got another one for you!"'') introducing the next joke is often ascribed to him, however, it was firstly introduced by [[Heinz Erhardt]], as many of Waalkes' set phrases are.

Waalkes played roles that became famous on their own, for example the reporter ''Harry Hirsch'', ''Frau Suhrbier'' and the senior forestry official ''Oberförster Pudlich'', as well as Herbert von Karamalz, who portrays a parody of [[Herbert von Karajan]] and a nod to a German brand of [[Malt beer]].<ref name="award_20181004">{{cite web|url=https://www.rheinpfalz.de/politik_artikel,-ein-orden-f%C3%BCr-den-g%C3%B6tterboten-_arid,1278899_type,amp.html|title=Ein Orden für den Götterboten|first=Winfried|last=Folz|work=Die Rheinpfalz|date=4 October 2018|access-date=31 October 2020|language=de}}</ref> 

Waalkes' most famous comic character is the ''Ottifant'' ('Ottiphant'), which he drew originally only for the cover of a record. Over time, the stick-figure developed into a distinct cartoon character with its own family. Their adventures and stories were published in several newspapers and books. Furthermore, a cartoon series, consisting of 13 episodes, depicted the Ottifanten on [[RTL (German TV channel)|RTL]] and [[Super RTL]] in 1993. An animated cinema movie named ''Kommando Störtebeker'' portrayed the Ottifanten.

Besides his stage performances, Waalkes has appeared several times on camera as an actor or off camera as a director. His movies are parodies of current events within the scope of culture and public life and are characterized by situation comedy and caricatured individuals.

In 2018, Waalkes was awarded with the [[Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany]] First Class for his lifework.<ref name="award_20181004"/><ref>{{cite web |title=www.bundespraesident.de: Der Bundespräsident / Reisen und Termine / Ordensverleihung zum Tag der Deutschen Einheit |url=http://www.bundespraesident.de/SharedDocs/Berichte/DE/Frank-Walter-Steinmeier/2018/10/181002-Verdienstorden-TdDE.html |website=www.bundespraesident.de}}</ref>

In June 2021, a German film version of ''[[Catweazle]]'' was released with Waalkes in the title role.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Ol99rYnLMA&feature=youtu.be|title=CATWEAZLE Official Trailer | publisher=Otto Waalkes. 28 Oct 2020 | access-date=28 November 2020}}</ref>
