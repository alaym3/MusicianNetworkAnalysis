'''Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds''' are an English [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 2010 as the solo moniker of former [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] songwriter, lead guitarist, and backing vocalist [[Noel Gallagher]]. The touring band consists of former Oasis members [[Gem Archer]] (guitar), Mike Rowe (piano), and [[Chris Sharrock]] (drums), as well as former [[The Zutons|Zutons]] member Russell Pritchard (bass). The band has also had a variety of guests contribute to albums such as the [[Crouch End Festival Chorus]], [[Amorphous Androgynous]], [[Johnny Marr]], and [[Paul Weller]].

Since his departure from Oasis in August 2009, many speculated that Gallagher might record a solo album. In July 2011, he held a press conference to confirm this, after denying rumours from his brother [[Liam Gallagher|Liam]] that Liam had already heard the tracks featured on it. Later that year, Noel released the project's [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds (album)|self-titled debut album]]. Several singles from the album were released, including "[[The Death of You and Me]]", "[[If I Had a Gun...]]", "[[AKA... What a Life!]]", "[[Dream On (Noel Gallagher song)|Dream On]]", and "[[Everybody's on the Run]]". In 2015, High Flying Birds released their second album, ''[[Chasing Yesterday (album)|Chasing Yesterday]]''. Their third, ''[[Who Built the Moon?]]'', followed in November 2017.

Gallagher stated in an interview on ''[[The Jonathan Ross Show]]'' that the inspiration for the band's name was from two sources: the idea to prefix the name with "Noel Gallagher's" was formed while he was listening to the album ''[[Fleetwood Mac (1968 album)|Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac]]'', while the latter part of the name is taken from the song "[[High Flying Bird (song)|High Flying Bird]]", most notably recorded by [[Jefferson Airplane]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/noel-gallagher-334-1276892|title=Noel Gallagher's solo album title inspired by Fleetwood Mac, Jefferson Airplane – NME|date=2011-08-02|work=NME|access-date=2017-05-17|language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
===Break-up of Oasis (2009–2010)===
On 12 July 2009, rumours that Noel Gallagher intended to go solo spread, but this was not true. Two months later, a fight between the Gallagher brothers took place in a backstage area, reportedly resulting in Noel's guitar being smashed by Liam, and Noel subsequently storming off. On 28 August 2009 Oasis' manager announced the cancellation of their concert at the [[Rock en Seine]] festival near Paris just minutes before it was about to begin, along with the cancellation of the European tour and a statement that Oasis "does not exist anymore".<ref name="leparisien-split">{{Cite news|url=http://www.leparisien.fr/loisirs-et-spectacles/oasis-annule-son-concert-a-rock-en-seine-et-se-separe-28-08-2009-619494.php|title=Oasis annule son concert à Rock-en-Seine et se sépare|work=Le Parisien|location=France|date=29 August 2009|access-date=29 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="ouestfrance-split">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ouest-france.fr/actu/actuDetFdj_-Oasis-annonce-la-fin-du-groupe_39382-1050490_actu.Htm|publisher=[[Ouest France]]|title=Oasis annonce la fin du groupe rock|date=29 August 2009|access-date=29 August 2009}}</ref><ref name="noelquitstatement">{{cite web|url=http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=773|title=A statement from Noel|publisher=Oasisnet.com|date=28 August 2009|access-date=28 August 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090829201005/http://www.oasisinet.com/NewsArticle.aspx?n=773|archive-date=29 August 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/a174501/oasis-split-as-noel-gallagher-quits-band.html |title=Music – News – Oasis split as Noel Gallagher quits band |website=Digital Spy |date=28 August 2009 |access-date=3 October 2009}}</ref> Two hours later, a statement from Noel appeared on the band's website writing that "with some sadness and great relief...I quit Oasis tonight. People will write and say what they like, but I simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer."

===High Flying Birds and scrapped Amorphous Androgynous album project (2011–2012)===
[[File:Noel Gallagher at Razzmatazz, Barcelona, Spain-5March2012 (6).jpg|thumbnail|upright|Gallagher in 2012]]
Gallagher's solo career plans began in earnest after Oasis disbanded, on 6 July 2011, Gallagher held a press conference in London<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.noelgallagher.com |title=The Official Noel Gallagher Website &#124; Home |publisher=Noelgallagher.com |date=1 December 2011 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref> during which he announced that Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds would release a [[Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds (album)|self-titled album]] on 17 October 2011, and a second collaboration with [[Amorphous Androgynous]] would be released in 2012. In August 2011, he released his debut single "[[The Death of You and Me]]", to positive reviews. Following the success of "The Death of You and Me", Gallagher confirmed on his website that the band's next UK single would be "[[AKA... What a Life!]]" which was released on 11 September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhZZSd5kzdA |title=Brand new Vauxhall TV ad – Football |publisher=YouTube |date=31 August 2011 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.noelgallagher.com/#news/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-announce-ne | title = Noel gallagher's high flying birds announce new uk single | date = 2011-09-11 | publisher = Noel Gallagher}}</ref> "[[If I Had a Gun...]]", Gallagher's first US single, was made available on iTunes on 20 September 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/album/if-i-had-a-gun...-single/id464096983?v0=9988&ign-mpt=uo%3D1 |title=iTunes Store |publisher=itunes.apple.com |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref> Gallagher's second album was to be a collaboration with [[Amorphous Androgynous]], due in late 2012. He said, "It sounds a bit like Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon|Dark Side of the Moon]]''. The sound is similar to ''High Flying Birds'', but more psychedelic and tripped out. It's not an electronic project. People are jumping to that conclusion because Amorphous Androgynous used to be an electronic outfit."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/music/news/a340792/noel-gallagher-solo-material-wouldnt-make-it-onto-an-oasis-album.html |title=Noel Gallagher: 'Solo material wouldn't make it onto an Oasis album' – Music News |website=Digital Spy |date=16 September 2011 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref>

In the press conference, explaining solo album material and collaboration talk, Gallagher admitted the collaboration is "fucking far out. It's got like 18 tracks on it, some of it's [[krautrock]], some of it's soul, some of it's funk and that's just the first song." Then later confessing, that he was nervous about releasing his second solo album with Amorphous Androgynous. "A lot of people are looking forward to it, which I'm a bit nervous about. They're building it up in their own minds, thinking it's going to be something it might not be when they hear it." He later found it hard to say "no comment" to journalists, adding, "I'm just cursed with an absolute endless stream of one-liners. I'm sorry about that. People say it's the way I talk in interviews that makes people interested. But they just mean I'm honest. 'Oh, he's got a way with honesty, that lad…' How depressing is that?"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallagher/57827 |title=Noel Gallagher: 'Amorphous Androgynous collaboration is fucking far out' |work=Nme|date=7 July 2011 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds/60093 |title=Noel Gallagher: 'I'd be up for collaborating with U2 or Coldplay' &#124; News |work=Nme|date=30 October 2011 |access-date=2012-01-08}}</ref> On 16 March 2012, Gallagher announced that an EP titled ''[[Songs from the Great White North]]'' would be released exclusively for Record Shop Day on 21 April 2012.

For the High Flying Birds touring band, Gallagher recruited keyboardist Mike Rowe and drummer Jeremy Stacey, both of whom continued their roles from the album sessions. Former [[The Zutons]] bassist Russell Pritchard, upon hearing that Gallagher had recorded an album and was putting together a band, got in touch and offered his services. David McConnell of [[The Sand Band]] was originally chosen for the lead guitarist role<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/16/sand-band-all-through-the-night-review|title=The Sand Band: All Through the Night – review|last=Grundy|first=Gareth|work=The Guardian|date=2011-01-16|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref> but dropped out four weeks before the band's first show; American musician Tim Smith, whom Rowe and Stacey had known from their time together as part of [[Sheryl Crow]]'s backing band, was hired as the new guitarist.<ref name=Young>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nlXhbikgK8|title=How to Get to the Rest of the World|last=Young|first=Craig|publisher=YouTube|access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref>

===''Chasing Yesterday'' (2013–2016)===
On 15 August 2013, Noel Gallagher appeared on the TalkSPORT show “The Sports Bar”, presented by Andy Goldstein and Jason Cundy, to discuss Manchester City and other sports topics. When confronted with questions from fans on Twitter and through Email, Andy Goldstein read through speculations of rumours of an Oasis reunion for Gallagher while on the show. Once again, Gallagher swatted away any possible Oasis reunion for 2014, and then was asked if he was working on any new 'High Flying Birds' material. Gallagher confirmed on the talk show:

"I've got tons of songs leftover from the last one. What am I doing at the moment? I'm writing, putting stuff together. I'll definitely make another one, [a new album], that's for sure! I don't want to go back out on the road though, that's the thing."<ref name="nme.com">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallagher/72090 |title=Noel Gallagher on Damon Albarn collaboration rumours: 'It's news to me!' |work=Nme|date=2013-08-17 |access-date=2014-08-02}}</ref> Guarding any more of detail of a new second solo album, Gallagher was then asked for a release date of new material, and with hesitation, he said: "It'll probably come out when it's finished, I don't know."<ref name="nme.com"/>

Gallagher said on 20 October 2013 that his most recent songs that were written solely for the new album were his 'best songs ever' written. "I finished it and I played it (the new songs), I think 'That's pretty good! In fact, it might be the best song I’ve ever written!' — Until I heard 'Rock and Roll Star' on the radio, and go, 'Yeah… it's not that good!'."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.xfm.co.uk/artists/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds/news/noel-gallagher-second-album-ready-record/ |title=Noel Gallagher: Second Album Ready To Record &#124; News |publisher=XFM |date=2013-10-21 |access-date=2014-08-02}}</ref>

On 17 February 2014, Rosie Danvers and The Wired Strings collaborated with Noel Gallagher for his second solo album, recording strings for one track. The session occurred at [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London, according to the Wired Strings website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiredstrings.com/dev/news/news225.php |title=Wired Strings |publisher=Wired Strings |access-date=2014-08-02}}</ref>

On 29 May 2014, Gallagher posted a photo on his official Facebook page confirming he has started work on his second album and follow-up. The photo shows him tuning one of his many electric guitars.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=652191341521962&set=a.192888910785543.47802.137619119645856&type=1 |title=Noel Gallagher – Timeline Photos |publisher=Facebook |access-date=2014-08-02}}</ref>

On 17 June 2014, his wife, Sara MacDonald, indicated on [[Instagram]] that Gallagher was in the middle of recording his new album. She posted a message to fans confirming that Gallagher would not be making his usual trip to the World Cup, "Brace yourselves people.......he's not going. At all. He is too busy".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iphoneogram.com/p/742051108516208482_527984806/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140711133521/http://www.iphoneogram.com/p/742051108516208482_527984806/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-07-11 |title=Photo by Sara Macdonald(saspg): Summer bliss |publisher=iPhoneogram |access-date=2014-08-02 }}</ref>

On 13 October 2014, it was announced that a new album titled ''[[Chasing Yesterday (album)|Chasing Yesterday]]'' would be released on 2 March 2015. The first single from the album, "[[In the Heat of the Moment]]", was released on 17 November 2014 followed by "[[Ballad of the Mighty I]]" and "[[Riverman (Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds song)|Riverman]]". A UK, European and North American tour followed as well as many festival appearances.

[[File:Noel Gallagher's High Flying Birds, Clapham Common, Calling Festival, London (19612282615).jpg|thumbnail|High Flying Birds in 2015]]
On 4 July 2015 they headlined at Calling Festival in [[Clapham Common]]. After performing their first song, "Everybody's on the Run", Noel spoke to the crowd saying; "Hello Clapham... Now there's something I never thought I'd say."

The [[Chasing Yesterday Tour]] continued into 2016, though on 7 March – a day before the tour resumed in Guadalajara, Mexico – it was announced that drummer [[Jeremy Stacey]] would be departed from touring band and joining [[King Crimson]].<ref name="staceykc">{{Cite news|url=https://www.dgmlive.com/news/new-drummer-for-kc|title=New Drummer For KC|work=DGM Live |date=7 March 2016|access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref> After this leg of the tour took the band to South America, Australia and Europe, Stacey's final show was on 30 April in his hometown of Bournemouth.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/14444440.Noel_Gallagher__We_spent_a_weekend_wandering_Bournemouth_looking_for_my_wife_s_old_flat/|title=Noel Gallagher: We spent a weekend wandering Bournemouth looking for my wife's old flat|work=Bournemoth Echo|date=22 April 2016|access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

For the remainder of the tour, Gallagher reunited with former Oasis touring drummer [[Chris Sharrock]], whose first show was in Atlanta on 1 July. Sharrock was actually one of only two drummers in England, along with Stacey, that Gallagher originally considered during High Flying Birds' inception. However, since Sharrock had already joined [[Beady Eye]], Liam Gallagher's new band with the other former members of Oasis, that left Stacey as the only choice by default.<ref name=Young /> 
Though Stacey had left the touring band, he would still be the primary drummer for the recording sessions of High Flying Birds' third album, ''[[Who Built the Moon?]]''

The tour concluded that September with a one-off show at the [[Brixton Academy]] (the first time Noel had ever headlined the venue with either his High Flying Birds or [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]]). During this show, Noel was joined on stage by special guests [[Johnny Marr]] and [[Paul Weller]].<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.nme.com/news/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds/96235 |title=Watch Johnny Marr and Paul Weller join Noel Gallagher to play Oasis and Jam classics|magazine=NME |access-date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' gave a positive review stating, "The greater appeal of ''Chasing Yesterday'' is in the way Gallagher, 47, now does reflection, loss and persistent optimism, leavening his usual power chords and pub-choir-ready choruses with a dusky, psychedelic churn that exposes the long, hidden thread running from early-Seventies [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]] to [[The Stone Roses]]." ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' gave the album a 4/5 rating writing that, "While it may appear to arrive under a typically vague or clanging banner in the tradition of ''[[Dig Out Your Soul]]'' or ''[[Standing on the Shoulder of Giants]]'', ''Chasing Yesterday'' is the most fittingly titled album to bear Noel Gallagher's name. The 47-year-old is in reflective lyrical mode, revealing his view from middle age, trying to find peace with the past, or (textbook mid-life crisis material) searching for a spectral, unattainable female.".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-album-reviews/chasing-yesterday-127666/#! |title=chasing yesterday album review |date=3 March 2015 |access-date=12 February 2020}}</ref>

Gallagher announced he had begun working on a third solo album on 6 October 2016, when he posted a picture on [[Instagram]] of himself in a studio with the caption, "New shoes. New amp. New album. There is no rest for the wicked ones."

On 24 June 2017, Gallagher introduced a special screening of the Oasis documentary ''[[Oasis: Supersonic|Supersonic]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/watch-noel-gallagher-lead-glastonbury-sing-along-dont-look-back-anger-2093035|title=Watch Noel Gallagher lead Glastonbury through a sing-along of 'Don't Look Back In Anger'|website=Nme.com|date=24 June 2017|access-date=23 October 2021}}</ref>

''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "The third record from Noel Gallagher’s solo outfit is, according to the ex-Oasis man, merely him in 'more colourful clothes'. Brightness is certainly the first thing that strikes you about ''Who Built the Moon'', an album that cloaks Gallagher’s hardy guitar-pop in glowing Smithsian riffs, tin whistle samples from novelty 60s tunes and a heady fug of riotous glam rock. Particular highlights include the gloriously Slade-esque 'Holy Mountain' and the singalong-friendly 'Black and White Sunshine,' which resembles Oasis basking on a sun lounger. Even the fact that the album regularly recalls some of the duller post-Britpop bands – 'It’s a Beautiful World' is basically an Elbow track backed by a breakbeat – can't dampen the joy that rings out from every corner. Producer David Holmes may be responsible for Noel’s change of pace, but the vibrancy and strains of psychedelia never feel like intruders: instead, they act as the perfect foil for the record’s blissed-out lyrics about life-changing love."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/nov/23/noel-gallaghers-high-flying-birds-who-built-the-moon-review-oasis |title = Who Built the Moon? review |date = 23 November 2017 |access-date=28 February 2020}}</ref>
