LaBelle began her career in the early 1960s as lead singer and front woman of the vocal group, [[Labelle|Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles]]. Following the group's name change to Labelle in the 1970s, they released the popular [[disco]] song "[[Lady Marmalade]]" which was later inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. As a result, the group became the first [[African Americans|African-American]] vocal group to land the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine and the first pop group to play at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].<ref name="biography"/>
LaBelle is referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godmother of Soul]]".<ref name="www.cnn.com">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnn.com/2019/07/03/entertainment/patti-labelle-philadelphia-street/|title=Patti LaBelle gets Philadelphia street named after her|last=Garvey|first=Marianne|website=CNN|date=July 3, 2019|access-date=March 17, 2021}}</ref>

After the group split in 1976, LaBelle began a successful solo career, starting with her critically acclaimed [[Patti LaBelle (album)|debut album]], which included the career-defining song, "[[You Are My Friend]]". LaBelle became a mainstream solo star in 1984 following the success of the singles, "[[If Only You Knew]]", "[[New Attitude (song)|New Attitude]]" and "[[Stir It Up (Patti LaBelle song)|Stir It Up]]", with the latter two crossing over to pop audiences and becoming radio staples.<ref name="biography"/>

Less than [[1986 in music|two years later]], in 1986, LaBelle scored with the number-one album, ''[[Winner in You]]''<ref>{{Cite web|title=Patti LaBelle|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/patti-labelle/chart-history/tlp/|access-date=2021-07-14|website=Billboard}}</ref> and the number-one duet single, "[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]", with [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Patti LaBelle|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/patti-labelle/chart-history/hsi/|access-date=2021-07-14|website=Billboard}}</ref> LaBelle won a [[34th Grammy Awards|1992 Grammy]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Female R&B Vocal Performance|Best Female R&B Vocal Performance]] for her 1991 album, ''[[Burnin' (Patti LaBelle album)|Burnin']]'', followed by a [[41st Grammy Awards|second Grammy win]] for the live album, ''Live!

Her [[1990s in music|1990s]] albums, ''Burnin''', ''[[Gems (Patti LaBelle album)|Gems]]'' (1994) and ''[[Flame (Patti LaBelle album)|Flame]]'' (1997), continued her popularity with young R&B audiences throughout the decade. Following the release of two mildly received solo albums in [[2000s in music|the early new millennium]], she reunited with her Labelle bandmates for the album, ''[[Back to Now]]'', followed by a well received promotional tour.<ref name="biography"/> LaBelle's success has extended as an actress with a role in the Oscar nominated film, ''[[A Soldier's Story]]'', and in TV shows such as ''[[A Different World]]'' and ''[[American Horror Story: Freak Show]]''. In 1992, LaBelle starred in her own TV sitcom, ''[[Out All Night (TV series)|Out All Night]]''.

In 2015, LaBelle took part in the dance competition, ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' at the age of 70. Labelle has also seen success launching her own brand of bedding, cook books and food for various companies.

==Early life and career==
===Patti LaBelle and the Bluebelles===
LaBelle was born Patricia Louise Holte in the Eastwick section of [[Southwest Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. She was born the second youngest child of Henry (1919-1989) and Bertha (Robinson; 1916-1978) Holte's three children, and the next-to-youngest of five children overall. Her siblings were Thomas Hogan Jr. (b. 1930), Vivian Hogan (1932-1975), Barbara (1942-1982) and Jacqueline "Jackie" (1945-1989).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/41/Patti-LaBelle.html|title=Patti LaBelle Biography|publisher=filmreference.com|access-date=December 22, 2011}}</ref> Her father was a [[railroad worker]] and club performer and her mother was a [[domestic worker|domestic]]. Despite enjoying her childhood, LaBelle would later write in her memoirs, ''Don't Block the Blessings'', that her parents' marriage was [[domestic abuse|abusive]]. Shortly after her parents' divorce, when LaBelle was twelve, she was [[child molestation|sexually molested]] by a family friend.

She joined a local church choir at the Beulah Baptist Church at ten and performed her first solo two years later. While she was growing up, she listened to [[secular music]] styles such as [[rhythm and blues|R&B]] and [[jazz]] music as well.

When she was sixteen, LaBelle won a talent competition at her high school, [[John Bartram High School]]. This success led to her first singing group, the Ordettes, in 1960, with schoolmates Jean Brown, Yvonne Hogen and Johnnie Dawson.{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=50}} With LaBelle as front woman, the group became a local attraction until two of its members left to marry, while another was forced to quit the group by her religious father.{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=51}} In 1962, the Ordettes included three new members, [[Cindy Birdsong]], [[Sarah Dash]] and [[Nona Hendryx]], the latter two girls having sung for another now defunct vocal group.{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=51}} That year, they auditioned for local record label owner Harold Robinson. Robinson agreed to work with the group after hearing LaBelle sing the song "[[I Sold My Heart to the Junkman]]". Initially, Robinson was dismissive of LaBelle, believing her to be "too dark and too plain".{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=51}}

Shortly after Robinson signed them, he had them record as the Blue Belles and they were selected to promote the recording of "I Sold My Heart to the Junkman", which had been recorded by [[The Starlets]]. It was recorded as a Blue Belles single due to label conflict.{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=51}} The Starlets' manager sued Harold Robinson after the Blue Belles were seen performing a [[lip-synching]] version of the song on ''[[American Bandstand]]''.{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=51}} After settling out of court, Robinson altered the group's name to "Patti LaBelle and The Blue Belles".{{sfn|Clemente|2013|p=51}} Robinson gave Holte the name "LaBelle", which meant "the beautiful" in French. Initially, a Billboard ad cited the group as "Patti Bell and the Blue Bells".{{sfn|Warner|2006|p=408}} In 1963, the group scored their first hit single with the ballad "[[Down the Aisle (The Wedding Song)|Down the Aisle]]" which became a crossover top 40 hit on the Billboard pop and R&B charts after [[King Records (United States)|King Records]] issued it. Later in the year, they recorded their rendition of the "[[You'll Never Walk Alone]]"; the single was later re-released on [[Cameo-Parkway Records]] where the group scored a second hit on the pop charts with the song in 1964. Another charted single, "[[Danny Boy]]", was released that same year. In 1965, after Cameo-Parkway folded, the group moved to New York and signed with [[Atlantic Records]] where they recorded twelve singles for the label, including the mildly charted singles "All or Nothing" and "Take Me for a Little While". The group's Atlantic tenure included their rendition of "[[Over the Rainbow]]" and a version of the song "[[Groovy Kind of Love]]". In 1967, Birdsong left the group to join [[The Supremes]] and by 1970 the group had been dropped from Atlantic Records as well as by their longtime manager Bernard Montague.

That year, [[Vicki Wickham]], producer of the UK music show ''[[Ready, Steady, Go]]'', agreed to manage the group after [[Dusty Springfield]] mentioned signing them. Wickham's first direction for the group was for them to change their name to simply Labelle and advised the group to renew their act, going for a more homegrown look and sound that reflected [[funk]], [[rock music|rock]] and [[psychedelic soul]]. In 1971, the group opened for [[the Who]] in several stops on the group's U.S. tour.

===Labelle===
{{Main|Labelle}}
[[File:Labelle 1975.JPG|thumb|right|LaBelle (''center'') with her Labelle bandmates [[Nona Hendryx]] and [[Sarah Dash]] in a 1974 promotional photo]]

Labelle signed with [[Warner Records|Warner Bros. Records]] and released their [[Labelle (album)|self-titled debut album]] in 1971. The record's psychedelic soul sound and its blending of rock, funk, soul and gospel rhythms was a departure from the group's early girl-group sound. That same year, they sang [[Backing vocalist|background vocals]] on [[Laura Nyro]]'s album, ''[[Gonna Take a Miracle]]''. A year later, in 1972, the group released ''[[Moon Shadow (album)|Moon Shadow]]'', which repeated the homegrown gritty sound of the previous album. In 1973, influenced by [[glam rock]]ers [[David Bowie]] and [[Elton John]], Wickham had the group dressed in silver space suits and luminescent makeup.{{sfn|Warner|2006|p=409}}

After their third successive album, ''[[Pressure Cookin']]'', failed to generate a hit, Labelle signed with [[Epic Records]] in 1974, releasing their most successful album to date, with ''[[Nightbirds]]'', which blended soul, funk, glam and rock music, thanks to the work of the album's producer, [[Allen Toussaint]]. The proto-disco single, "[[Lady Marmalade]]", would become their biggest-selling single, going number one on the Billboard Hot 100 and selling over a million copies, as did ''Nightbirds'', which later earned a [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] [[List of music recording certifications|gold]] award, for sales of a million units. In October 1974, Labelle made pop history by becoming the first rock and roll vocal group to perform at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musicianguide.com/biographies/1608003882/Patti-LaBelle.html|title=Musician Guide Biography: Patti LaBelle|access-date=September 2, 2009}}</ref> Riding high on the success of "Lady Marmalade" and the ''Nightbirds'' album, Labelle made the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' in 1975.

Labelle released two more albums, ''[[Phoenix (Labelle album)|Phoenix]]'' and ''[[Chameleon (Labelle album)|Chameleon]]'' in 1975 and 1976, respectively. While both albums continued the group's critical success, none of the singles issued on those albums ever crossed over to the pop charts. By 1976, Patti, Nona and Sarah began arguing over the group's musical direction. Personal difficulties came to a head during a show on December 16, 1976, in Baltimore, Maryland, where Hendryx went backstage and injured herself during a [[nervous breakdown]]. Following the incident, LaBelle advised that the group separate.

==Solo career==
===Early solo career (1977â€“1984)===
Signing a solo contract with [[Epic Records]] in 1977, LaBelle recruited David Rubinson, producer of ''Chameleon'', to record her [[Patti LaBelle (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was released that year. The album was noted for the disco hits, "Joy to Have Your Love" and "Dan Swit Me" and the gospel ballad, "[[You Are My Friend]]", the latter song becoming her first career-defining single despite its low entry on the R&B chart. Three more albums were released in succession on Epic through 1980, with the songs "Eyes in the Back of My Head", "Little Girls", "Music is My Way of Life", "Come What May", "[[Release (The Tension)]]" and "[[I Don't Go Shopping]]" (the latter song co-written by [[Peter Allen (musician)|Peter Allen]]) being the most successful.

After four albums on Epic, LaBelle signed with [[Philadelphia International Records]] where she recorded a notable version of "Over the Rainbow" on the album ''[[The Spirit's in It]]''. In 1982, she was featured on the [[Grover Washington]] duet "[[The Best Is Yet to Come (Grover Washington Jr. song)|The Best Is Yet to Come]]", and earned accolades that year for starring in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical ''[[Your Arms Too Short to Box with God]]''. "The Best Is Yet to Come" later earned LaBelle her first Grammy Award nomination. In 1983, LaBelle released her breakthrough album ''[[I'm in Love Again]]'' which included her first top ten R&B singles, with "[[Love, Need and Want You]]" and "[[If Only You Knew]]", the latter song also becoming her first number-one single as a solo artist in early 1984. Later in 1984, she scored another hit with [[Bobby Womack]] on the song "[[Love Has Finally Come at Last]]" and appeared as a club singer in the film ''[[A Soldier's Story]]''.

===Crossover success (1984â€“2009)===
[[File:"Don't listen to rumors about AIDS, get the facts!" Patti LaBelle.A025218.jpg|left|thumb|LaBelle promoting AIDS awareness in the 1980s]]
In 1984, LaBelle recorded the songs "[[New Attitude (song)|New Attitude]]" and "[[Stir It Up (Patti LaBelle song)|Stir It Up]]" for the soundtrack to the [[Eddie Murphy]] film, ''[[Beverly Hills Cop]]''. Following the release of the film, "New Attitude" was released as a single in late 1984 and became LaBelle's first crossover solo hit, reaching number 17 on the Billboard Hot 100 and becoming a [[signature song]]. "Stir It Up" found similar success on pop radio and as a staple in dance clubs. In 1985, LaBelle performed on the TV special, ''Motown Returns to Apollo'' and also as part of the all-star benefit concert, ''[[Live Aid]]''. LaBelle's notoriety from performing on these two specials made her a pop star and led to having her own television special later that same year. Also in the same year, a video of a performance from her tour of that year was issued on VHS. During this period, LaBelle ended her contractual obligations to Philadelphia International and signed with [[MCA Records]].

LaBelle shared a stage with [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Dionne Warwick]] for the 1986 HBO special ''[[Sisters in the Name of Love]]''.  During the same year LaBelle released her best-selling solo album ''[[Winner in You]]'', which reached number one on the pop charts. The album included the international number-one hit, "[[On My Own (Patti LaBelle and Michael McDonald song)|On My Own]]" and the hit ballad "Oh People". The success of ''Winner in You'' would prove to be the peak of her solo success, though she continued her acclaim with the 1989 release of ''[[Be Yourself (Patti LaBelle album)|Be Yourself]]'', which featured "Yo Mister" and the hit ballad "[[If You Asked Me To]]", which found bigger success in a remake by singer [[Celine Dion]]. In the year of that album's release, LaBelle began a successful stint in a recurring role on ''[[A Different World]]'', the success of which spawned a brief sitcom of her own, titled ''[[Out All Night (TV series)|Out All Night]]'', which only lasted a season. In 1991, she recorded a hit duet version of the [[Babyface (musician)|Babyface]] composition, "[[Superwoman (Karyn White song)|Superwoman]]" with [[Gladys Knight]] and [[Dionne Warwick]]. In the same year, LaBelle released the solo album, ''[[Burnin' (Patti LaBelle album)|Burnin']]'', which went gold, with three successive top five singles on the R&B charts. This success led to LaBelle winning her first Grammy Award in the Best Female R&B Vocal Performance category in the 34th Annual Grammy Award Ceremony of 1992, sharing the win with singer [[Lisa Fischer]], who won for her hit ballad, "[[How Can I Ease the Pain]]", in a rare tie in the history of the Grammys.{{sfn|Jet|1992|p=31}}

LaBelle's 1994 album, ''[[Gems (Patti LaBelle album)|Gems]]'', also went gold and featured the hit, "[[The Right Kinda Lover]]". On January 29, 1995, LaBelle performed at the [[Super Bowl XXIX]] halftime show, held at the Joe Robbie Stadium (which later became [[Hard Rock Stadium]]) in [[Miami, Florida]] with [[Tony Bennett]], [[Arturo Sandoval]] and [[Miami Sound Machine]]. LaBelle released the album, ''[[Flame (Patti LaBelle album)|Flame]]'', which included the dance hit, "When You Talk About Love". LaBelle released her best-selling memoirs, ''Don't Block the Blessings'', in 1996, and released the first of five best-selling cookbooks in 1997. In 1998, she released the live album, ''[[Live! One Night Only]]'', later resulting in a second Grammy win the following February. It remains her most recent Grammy win. In 2000, LaBelle released her final MCA album, ''When a Woman Loves'', before signing with Def Soul Classics to release the 2004 album, ''Timeless Journey''. Following the release of her 2005 covers album, ''Classic Moments'', LaBelle engaged in a rivalry with [[Antonio "L.A." Reid]] over the direction of her career, leading to her leaving the label.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patti Labelle vs. Antonio 'LA' Reid: Did mogul pull artists out of her all-star birthday celebration?|publisher=EURweb|url=http://www.eurweb.com/printable.cfm?id=22939|date=October 18, 2005|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108062038/http://www.eurweb.com/printable.cfm?id=22939|archive-date=January 8, 2009}}</ref> In the same year, the [[World Music Awards]] recognized her years in the music business by awarding her the Legend Award. In 2006, she released her first gospel album, ''[[The Gospel According to Patti LaBelle]]'' on the Bungalo label, the album later peaking at number one on Billboard's gospel chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Patti LaBelle's first gospel album recalls her Baptist roots|author=Campbell, Dwayne|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|date=December 15, 2006|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/news/article/8997/patti-labelles-first-gospel-album-recalls-her-baptist-roots/}}</ref> LaBelle also released the book, ''Patti's Pearls'', during this period. She returned to Def Jam in 2007 and released her second holiday album, ''Miss Patti's Christmas''. In 2008, LaBelle briefly reunited with Nona Hendryx and Sarah Dash as Labelle on the group's first new album in more than 30 years, ''[[Back to Now]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ew.com/article/2008/10/15/back-now/|title=Back to Now|website=EW.com|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>

==Personal life==
LaBelle dropped out of Philadelphia's [[John Bartram High School]] just a semester before graduating in 1962. LaBelle returned to the school in her mid-thirties and later earned her diploma.

LaBelle wrote that she was [[sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] by [[Jackie Wilson]] while at the Brevoort Theatre at [[Brooklyn]] in the 1960s. Around 1964, LaBelle was engaged to [[Otis Williams]], founding member of [[The Temptations]]. The engagement lasted a year before Patti broke it off after fearing Williams would force her to move to [[Detroit]] and retire from the road.

On July 23, 1969, LaBelle married a longtime friend, Armstead Edwards, who was a [[schoolteacher]]. After LaBelle started her solo career, Edwards became her manager, a position he would remain in until 2000. That year, LaBelle announced that she and Edwards had legally separated, with their divorce finalized in 2003. They have a son, Zuri Kye Edwards (born July 17, 1973), who is now her manager. Following Zuri's birth, LaBelle suffered from [[postpartum depression]] for a year and said singer-songwriter [[Laura Nyro]] helped the singer to cope with it helping to take care of Zuri until she eventually got over it. Through Zuri (whose name means "beautiful" in Swahili), LaBelle is a grandmother of two girls.

Members of LaBelle's family died at young ages. Her mother Bertha died in October 1978 from diabetes at the age of 62.{{sfn|Jet|1990|p=56}} Her father, Henry Holte Jr., died of complications from [[emphysema]] and [[Alzheimer's disease]] in October 1989 at the age of 70.

All three of LaBelle's sisters died young. Eldest sister Vivian Hogan Rogers died of lung cancer in October 1975 at the age of 43. Seven years later, in October 1982, her elder sister Barbara Holte Purifoy died from complications of colon cancer at the age of 40. In July 1989, LaBelle lost her youngest sister, Jacqueline "Jackie" Holte-Padgett, to brain cancer at the age of 43. A day after the singer buried Padgett, an emotionally-wrecked LaBelle shot the music video to "If You Asked Me To" where she was seen crying in various shots; the video was shot on what would've been Padgett's 44th birthday. The singer dedicated her 1991 ''[[Burnin' (Patti LaBelle album)|Burnin']]'' album, and her famous rendition of the song "[[Wind Beneath My Wings]]" during her concert tour in 1991-92 to Padgett.

LaBelle said because of her sisters and parents dying "before their time", she wrote in her autobiography that she feared she wouldn't make it to 50. Once she reached that age, however, the singer said she felt her life "had just begun". A year later, LaBelle was diagnosed as having diabetes and later became a spokesperson for several organizations dedicated in fighting the disease.

She has a home in the Philadelphia suburb of [[Wynnewood, Pennsylvania|Wynnewood]] and also has condos in Los Angeles and in [[Eleuthera]], the [[Bahamas]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/19/travel/19out.html|title=The Flip Side of the Bahamas|last=Lee|first=Denny|date=February 19, 2006|work=The New York Times|access-date=November 30, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

==Civil suits==
In 2010, LaBelle went into a rage that resulted in her verbally and physically attacking a mother and her 18 month old daughter.  The singer threw water, yelled obscenities, and attempted to assault the mother during a 10-minute tirade in the lobby of the Trump Place Apartments in Manhattan, NY.  LaBelle agreed to a settlement of $100,000 and attempted to get her son's deposition, where he lied that no altercation took place, destroyed following the settlement.  The family donated the award to a charity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/patti-labelle-pay-planned-settlement-victims-lawyer/story?id=17181814|title=LaBelle May Not Pay Settlement|website=ABC News}}</ref>

In June 2011, a [[West Point]] cadet filed a civil suit against LaBelle after he was allegedly assaulted by her bodyguards at George Bush Intercontinental Airport in [[Houston]], Texas. LaBelle and her entourage were on their way to a gig in [[Louisiana]] when Richard King, a 23-year-old cadet on spring break, was waiting to be picked up in the ride-share area.  King alleged that Labelle's entourage attacked King, causing a concussion, and stated that he had provoked the attack. Video evidence showed he was on a cell phone prior to the attack and did not engage any of the members of Labelle's group until after they assaulted him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.houstonpress.com/news/patti-labelle-sued-for-assault-by-west-point-cadet-updated-with-incredible-video-6751053|title=Patti LaBelle Sued for Assault by West Point Cadet (UPDATED With Incredible Video)|first=Craig|last=Malisow|date=June 2, 2011|website=Houston Press}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/3157370/richard-king-v-patti-labelle/|title=Richard King v.

LaBelle filed a counter-suit. Efrem Holmes, Labelle's bodyguard, was acquitted of misdemeanor assault on November 12, 2013 stemming from the incident.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2013/11/12/patti-labelle-s-bodyguard-acquitted-of-airport-assault.html|title=Patti LaBelle Bodyguard acquitted of airport assault|website=Bet.com|access-date=July 29, 2014}}</ref>

==Pop culture==
Patti LaBelle has been described as "the greatest gay icon of all time and a prime example of the intersection of the [[LGBT]] community and black female artists".<ref>{{cite book |last=Cane |first=Caly |date=2017 |title=Live Through This: Surviving the Intersections of Sexuality, God, and Race |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wQJuDwAAQBAJ&q=%22Patti+Labelle%22+%22gay+icon%22&pg=PT212 |publisher=Cleis Press |isbn= 9781627782197}}</ref>  In a 2017 interview, she said: "when I think about it, the gay fans are some of the reason â€“ one big reason â€“ I'm still standing, 'cause they loved me when other people tried not to. Everybody always says, "What makes gay men like you?" "I have no clue," I say. I still don't. But I know that love has lifted me up for many, many years."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thegavoice.com/culture/music/patti-labelle-dishes-still-standing-thanks-lgbt-community-lip-syncing-divettes-trump/|title=Patti LaBelle dishes on 'still standing' thanks to the LGBT community, lip-syncing 'divettes' and Trump|last=Azzopardi|first=Chris|date=October 18, 2017|website=Georgia Voice|access-date=January 8, 2020}}</ref>

LaBelle made some headlines in late 2015 when a [[vlogger]] known as James Wright (No Chanel) spoke enthusiastically on YouTube of her brand of sweet potato pies. The video quickly went viral and for a time, one pie sold every second at Walmart, selling out at stores across the country.
