=== Constipation ===
Like [[loperamide]] and other opioids, morphine acts on the [[myenteric plexus]] in the intestinal tract, reducing gut motility, causing constipation. The gastrointestinal effects of morphine are mediated primarily by [[mu Opioid receptor|μ-opioid receptors]] in the bowel. By inhibiting gastric emptying and reducing propulsive [[peristalsis]] of the intestine, morphine decreases the rate of intestinal transit. Reduction in gut secretion and increased intestinal fluid absorption also contribute to the constipating effect. Opioids also may act on the gut indirectly through tonic gut spasms after inhibition of [[nitric oxide]] generation.<ref name="pmid15082884">{{cite journal | vauthors = Stefano GB, Zhu W, Cadet P, Bilfinger TV, Mantione K | title = Morphine enhances nitric oxide release in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract via the micro(3) opiate receptor subtype: a hormonal role for endogenous morphine | journal = Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology | volume = 55 | issue = 1 Pt 2 | pages = 279–88 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15082884 }}</ref> This effect was shown in animals when a nitric oxide precursor, [[L-arginine]], reversed morphine-induced changes in gut motility.<ref name="Calignano, Moncada and Di Rosa">{{cite journal | vauthors = Calignano A, Moncada S, Di Rosa M | title = Endogenous nitric oxide modulates morphine-induced constipation | journal = Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications | volume = 181 | issue = 2 | pages = 889–93 | date = December 1991 | pmid = 1755865 | doi = 10.1016/0006-291X(91)91274-G }}</ref>

=== Hormone imbalance ===
{{See also|Opioid#Hormone imbalance}}
Clinical studies consistently conclude that morphine, like other opioids, often causes [[hypogonadism]] and [[hormone imbalance]]s in chronic users of both sexes. This side effect is [[dose–response relationship|dose-dependent]] and occurs in both therapeutic and recreational users. Morphine can interfere with menstruation in women by suppressing levels of [[luteinizing hormone]]. Many studies suggest the majority (perhaps as many as 90%) of chronic opioid users have opioid-induced hypogonadism. This effect may cause the increased likelihood of [[osteoporosis]] and [[bone fracture]] observed in chronic morphine users. Studies suggest the effect is temporary. {{As of|2013}}, the effect of low-dose or acute use of morphine on the endocrine system is unclear.<ref name="pmid23414717">{{cite journal | vauthors = Brennan MJ | title = The effect of opioid therapy on endocrine function | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 126 | issue = 3 Suppl 1 | pages = S12-8 | date = March 2013 | pmid = 23414717 | doi = 10.1016/j.amjmed.2012.12.001 }}</ref><ref name="pmid19193821">{{cite journal | vauthors = Colameco S, Coren JS | title = Opioid-induced endocrinopathy | journal = The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association | volume = 109 | issue = 1 | pages = 20–5 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19193821 }}</ref>

=== Effects on human performance ===
Most reviews conclude that opioids produce minimal impairment of human performance on tests of sensory, motor, or attentional abilities. However, recent studies have been able to show some impairments caused by morphine, which is not surprising, given that morphine is a [[central nervous system]] [[depressant]]. Morphine has resulted in impaired functioning on critical flicker frequency (a measure of overall CNS arousal) and impaired performance on the [[Maddox wing]] test (a measure of the deviation of the visual axes of the eyes). Few studies have investigated the effects of morphine on motor abilities; a high dose of morphine can impair finger tapping and the ability to maintain a low constant level of [[isometric exercise|isometric force]] (i.e. fine motor control is impaired),<ref name="pmid1755931">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerr B, Hill H, Coda B, Calogero M, Chapman CR, Hunt E, Buffington V, Mackie A | display-authors = 6 | title = Concentration-related effects of morphine on cognition and motor control in human subjects | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 5 | issue = 3 | pages = 157–66 | date = November 1991 | pmid = 1755931 }}</ref> though no studies have shown a correlation between morphine and gross motor abilities.

In terms of [[cognitive]] abilities, one study has shown that morphine may have a negative impact on [[anterograde amnesia|anterograde]] and [[retrograde amnesia|retrograde memory]],<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Friswell J, Phillips C, Holding J, Morgan CJ, Brandner B, Curran HV | title = Acute effects of opioids on memory functions of healthy men and women | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 198 | issue = 2 | pages = 243–50 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18379759 | doi = 10.1007/s00213-008-1123-x | s2cid = 2126631 }}</ref> but these effects are minimal and transient. Overall, it seems that acute doses of opioids in non-tolerant subjects produce minor effects in some sensory and motor abilities, and perhaps also in [[attention]] and cognition. It is likely that the effects of morphine will be more pronounced in opioid-naive subjects than chronic opioid users.

In chronic opioid users, such as those on Chronic Opioid Analgesic Therapy (COAT) for managing severe, [[chronic pain]], behavioural testing has shown normal functioning on perception, cognition, coordination and behaviour in most cases. One 2000 study<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Galski T, Williams JB, Ehle HT | title = Effects of opioids on driving ability | journal = Journal of Pain and Symptom Management | volume = 19 | issue = 3 | pages = 200–8 | date = March 2000 | pmid = 10760625 | doi = 10.1016/S0885-3924(99)00158-X | doi-access = free }}</ref> analysed COAT patients to determine whether they were able to safely operate a motor vehicle. The findings from this study suggest that stable opioid use does not significantly impair abilities inherent in driving (this includes physical, cognitive and perceptual skills). COAT patients showed rapid completion of tasks that require the speed of responding for successful performance (e.g., [[Rey Complex Figure]] Test) but made more errors than controls. COAT patients showed no deficits in visual-spatial perception and organization (as shown in the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale|WAIS-R]] Block Design Test) but did show impaired immediate and short-term visual memory (as shown on the Rey Complex Figure Test&nbsp;– Recall). These patients showed no impairments in higher-order cognitive abilities (i.e., planning). COAT patients appeared to have difficulty following instructions and showed a propensity toward impulsive behaviour, yet this did not reach statistical significance. It is important to note that this study reveals that COAT patients have no domain-specific deficits, which supports the notion that chronic opioid use has minor effects on [[Psychomotor learning|psychomotor]], [[cognitive]], or [[neuropsychological]] functioning.

=== Reinforcement disorders ===

==== Addiction ====

[[File:Santiago Rusinol Before the Morphine.jpg|thumb|left|''Before the Morphine'' by [[Santiago Rusiñol]]]]

Morphine is a highly [[addictive]] substance. In controlled studies comparing the physiological and subjective effects of [[heroin]] and morphine in individuals formerly addicted to opiates, subjects showed no preference for one drug over the other. Equipotent, injected doses had comparable action courses, with no difference in subjects' self-rated feelings of euphoria, ambition, nervousness, relaxation, drowsiness, or sleepiness.<ref name="martin and fraser" /> Short-term addiction studies by the same researchers demonstrated that tolerance developed at a similar rate to both heroin and morphine. When compared to the opioids [[hydromorphone]], [[fentanyl]], [[oxycodone]], and [[pethidine]]/[[meperidine]], former addicts showed a strong preference for heroin and morphine, suggesting that heroin and morphine are particularly susceptible to abuse and addiction. Morphine and heroin were also much more likely to produce euphoria and other positive subjective effects when compared to these other opioids.<ref name="martin and fraser" /> The choice of heroin and morphine over other opioids by former drug addicts may also be because heroin (also known as morphine diacetate, diamorphine, or diacetyl morphine) is an ester of morphine and a morphine [[prodrug]], essentially meaning they are identical drugs ''in vivo''. Heroin is converted to morphine before binding to the [[opioid receptor]]s in the brain and spinal cord, where morphine causes the subjective effects, which is what the addicted individuals are seeking.<ref name="urlDrugFacts: Heroin | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)">{{cite web |url = http://www.nida.nih.gov/infofacts/heroin.html |title = Heroin |author = National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) |date = April 2013 |website = DrugFacts |publisher = U.S. National Institutes of Health |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051130022758/http://www.nida.nih.gov/Infofacts/heroin.html |archive-date = 30 November 2005 |df = dmy-all |access-date = 29 April 2008 }}</ref>

==== Tolerance ====
Several hypotheses are given about how tolerance develops, including opioid receptor [[phosphorylation]] (which would change the receptor conformation), functional decoupling of receptors from [[G-proteins]] (leading to receptor desensitization),<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Roshanpour M, Ghasemi M, Riazi K, Rafiei-Tabatabaei N, Ghahremani MH, Dehpour AR | title = Tolerance to the anticonvulsant effect of morphine in mice: blockage by ultra-low dose naltrexone | journal = Epilepsy Research | volume = 83 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 261–4 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19059761 | doi = 10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2008.10.011 | s2cid = 21651602 }}</ref> μ-opioid receptor internalization or receptor down-regulation (reducing the number of available receptors for morphine to act on), and upregulation of the [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] pathway (a counterregulatory mechanism to opioid effects) (For a review of these processes, see Koch and Hollt.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Koch T, Höllt V | title = Role of receptor internalization in opioid tolerance and dependence | journal = Pharmacology & Therapeutics | volume = 117 | issue = 2 | pages = 199–206 | date = February 2008 | pmid = 18076994 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2007.10.003 }}</ref>) [[Cholecystokinin|CCK]] might mediate some counter-regulatory pathways responsible for opioid tolerance. CCK-antagonist drugs, specifically [[proglumide]], have been shown to slow the development of tolerance to morphine.

==== Dependence and withdrawal ====
{{See also|Opioid use disorder|Opioid withdrawal}}
{{more citations needed|section|date=November 2019}}
Cessation of dosing with morphine creates the prototypical opioid withdrawal syndrome, which, unlike that of [[barbiturates]], [[benzodiazepines]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], or sedative-hypnotics, is not fatal by itself in otherwise healthy people.

Acute morphine withdrawal, along with that of any other opioid, proceeds through a number of stages. Other opioids differ in the intensity and length of each, and weak opioids and mixed agonist-antagonists may have acute withdrawal syndromes that do not reach the highest level. As commonly cited{{by whom|date=November 2010}}, they are:
* '''Stage I''', 6&nbsp;h to 14&nbsp;h after last dose: Drug craving, anxiety, irritability, perspiration, and mild to moderate [[dysphoria]]
* '''Stage II''', 14&nbsp;h to 18&nbsp;h after last dose: Yawning, heavy perspiration, mild depression, lacrimation, crying, headaches, runny nose, [[dysphoria]], also intensification of the above symptoms, "yen sleep" (a waking trance-like state)
* '''Stage III''', 16&nbsp;h to 24&nbsp;h after last dose: [[Rhinorrhea]] (runny nose) and increase in other of the above, dilated pupils, piloerection (goose bumps – a purported origin of the phrase, 'cold turkey,' but in fact the phrase originated outside of drug treatment),<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-do-we-quit-cold-turkey |title = Why do We Quit 'Cold Turkey'? |access-date = 21 November 2016 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161121175014/http://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/why-do-we-quit-cold-turkey |archive-date = 21 November 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> muscle twitches, hot flashes, cold flashes, aching bones and muscles, loss of appetite, and the beginning of intestinal cramping
* '''Stage IV''', 24&nbsp;h to 36&nbsp;h after last dose: Increase in all of the above including severe cramping and involuntary leg movements ("kicking the habit" also called [[restless leg syndrome]]), loose stool, insomnia, elevation of blood pressure, moderate elevation in body temperature, increase in frequency of breathing and tidal volume, [[tachycardia]] (elevated pulse), restlessness, nausea
* '''Stage V''', 36&nbsp;h to 72&nbsp;h after last dose: Increase in the above, fetal position, vomiting, free and frequent liquid diarrhea, which sometimes can accelerate the time of passage of food from mouth to out of system, weight loss of 2&nbsp;kg to 5&nbsp;kg per 24&nbsp;h, increased [[White blood cell|white cell count]], and other blood changes
* '''Stage VI''', after completion of above: Recovery of appetite and normal bowel function, beginning of transition to postacute and chronic symptoms that are mainly psychological, but may also include increased sensitivity to pain, hypertension, [[colitis]] or other gastrointestinal afflictions related to motility, and problems with weight control in either direction

In advanced stages of withdrawal, ultrasonographic evidence of pancreatitis has been demonstrated in some patients and is presumably attributed to spasm of the pancreatic [[sphincter of Oddi]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.livestrong.com/article/68215-opiate-withdrawal-stages/ |title = Opiate Withdrawal Stages |access-date = 13 June 2014 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140605063405/http://www.livestrong.com/article/68215-opiate-withdrawal-stages/ |archive-date = 5 June 2014 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The withdrawal symptoms associated with morphine addiction are usually experienced shortly before the time of the next scheduled dose, sometimes within as early as a few hours (usually 6&nbsp;h to 12&nbsp;h) after the last administration. Early symptoms include watery eyes, insomnia, diarrhea, runny nose, yawning, [[dysphoria]], sweating, and in some cases a strong drug craving. Severe headache, restlessness, irritability, loss of appetite, body aches, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, tremors, and even stronger and more intense drug craving appear as the syndrome progresses. Severe depression and vomiting are very common. During the acute withdrawal period, systolic and diastolic blood pressures increase, usually beyond premorphine levels, and heart rate increases,<ref name="Chan, Irvine, and White">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chan R, Irvine R, White J | title = Cardiovascular changes during morphine administration and spontaneous withdrawal in the rat | journal = European Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 368 | issue = 1 | pages = 25–33 | date = February 1999 | pmid = 10096766 | doi = 10.1016/S0014-2999(98)00984-4 }}</ref> which have potential to cause a heart attack, blood clot, or stroke.

Chills or cold flashes with goose bumps ("[[cold turkey]]") alternating with flushing (hot flashes), kicking movements of the legs ("kicking the habit"<ref name="urlDrugFacts: Heroin | National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA)" />) and excessive sweating are also characteristic symptoms.<ref name="urlDrugs and Human Performance FACT SHEETS – Morphine (and Heroin)">{{cite web |url = http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/People/injury/research/job185drugs/morphine.htm |title = Morphine (and Heroin) |website = Drugs and Human Performance Fact Sheets |publisher = U.S. National Traffic Safety Administration |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061003085645/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/people/injury/research/job185drugs/morphine.htm |archive-date = 3 October 2006 |df = dmy-all |access-date = 17 May 2007 }}</ref> Severe pains in the bones and muscles of the back and extremities occur, as do muscle spasms. At any point during this process, a suitable narcotic can be administered that will dramatically reverse the withdrawal symptoms. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48&nbsp;h and 96&nbsp;h after the last dose and subside after about 8 to 12 days. Sudden withdrawal by heavily dependent users who are in poor health is very rarely fatal. Morphine withdrawal is considered less dangerous than alcohol, barbiturate, or benzodiazepine withdrawal.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/narcotics.html |title = Narcotics |website = DEA Briefs & Background, Drugs and Drug Abuse, Drug Descriptions |publisher = U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration |url-status = unfit |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120114150200/http://www.justice.gov/dea/concern/narcotics.html |archive-date = 14 January 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = Dalrymple T |author-link = Theodore Dalrymple |title = Romancing Opiates: Pharmacological Lies and the Addiction Bureaucracy |publisher = Encounter |year = 2006 |pages = [https://archive.org/details/romancingopiates00theo/page/160 160] |url = https://archive.org/details/romancingopiates00theo/page/160 |isbn = 978-1-59403-087-1 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

The psychological dependence associated with morphine [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] is complex and protracted. Long after the physical need for morphine has passed, the addict will usually continue to think and talk about the use of morphine (or other drugs) and feel strange or overwhelmed coping with daily activities without being under the influence of morphine. Psychological withdrawal from morphine is usually a very long and painful process. Addicts often suffer severe depression, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, amnesia (forgetfulness), low self-esteem, confusion, paranoia, and other psychological disorders. Without intervention, the syndrome will run its course, and most of the overt physical symptoms will disappear within 7 to 10 days including psychological dependence. A high probability of relapse exists after morphine withdrawal when neither the physical environment nor the behavioral motivators that contributed to the abuse have been altered. Testimony to morphine's addictive and reinforcing nature is its relapse rate. Abusers of morphine (and heroin) have one of the highest relapse rates among all drug users, ranging up to 98% in the estimation of some medical experts.<ref>{{Cite book | vauthors = O'Neil MJ |title = The Merck index : an encyclopedia of chemicals, drugs, and biological |year = 2006 |publisher = Merck |location = Whitehouse Station, N.J. |isbn = 978-0-911910-00-1 }}</ref>

Morphine is a [[phenanthrene]] [[opioid receptor]] [[receptor agonist|agonist]]&nbsp;– its main effect is binding to and activating the [[μ-opioid receptor]] (MOR) in the [[central nervous system]]. Its [[intrinsic activity]] at the MOR is heavily dependent on the [[assay]] and tissue being tested; in some situations it is a [[full agonist]] while in others it can be a [[partial agonist]] or even [[receptor antagonist|antagonist]].<ref name="pmid23646826">{{cite journal | vauthors = Kelly E | title = Efficacy and ligand bias at the μ-opioid receptor | journal = British Journal of Pharmacology | volume = 169 | issue = 7 | pages = 1430–46 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23646826 | pmc = 3724102 | doi = 10.1111/bph.12222 }}</ref> In clinical settings, morphine exerts its principal pharmacological effect on the central nervous system and [[human gastrointestinal tract|gastrointestinal tract]]. Its primary actions of therapeutic value are analgesia and sedation. Activation of the MOR is associated with analgesia, sedation, [[euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], physical [[chemical dependency|dependence]], and [[respiratory depression]]. Morphine is also a [[κ-opioid receptor]] (KOR) and [[δ-opioid receptor]] (DOR) agonist. Activation of the KOR is associated with spinal analgesia, [[miosis]] (pinpoint pupils), and [[psychotomimetic]] effects. The DOR is thought to play a role in analgesia.<ref name="rxlist.com" /> Although morphine does not bind to the [[sigma receptor|σ receptor]], it has been shown that σ receptor agonists, such as [[pentazocine|(+)-pentazocine]], inhibit morphine analgesia, and σ receptor antagonists enhance morphine analgesia,<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Chien CC, Pasternak GW | title = Sigma antagonists potentiate opioid analgesia in rats | journal = Neuroscience Letters | volume = 190 | issue = 2 | pages = 137–9 | date = May 1995 | pmid = 7644123 | doi = 10.1016/0304-3940(95)11504-P | s2cid = 10033780 }}</ref> suggesting downstream involvement of the σ receptor in the actions of morphine.

==== Gene expression ====
Studies have shown that morphine can alter the expression of a number of [[genes]]. A single injection of morphine has been shown to alter the expression of two major groups of genes, for proteins involved in [[mitochondria]]l respiration and for [[cytoskeleton]]-related proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Loguinov AV, Anderson LM, Crosby GJ, Yukhananov RY | title = Gene expression following acute morphine administration | journal = Physiological Genomics | volume = 6 | issue = 3 | pages = 169–81 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11526201 | doi = 10.1152/physiolgenomics.2001.6.3.169 | s2cid = 9296949 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/7182f69d9e103f968d5aef11aa933a981a907f9d }}</ref>

==== Effects on the immune system ====
Morphine has long been known to act on receptors expressed on cells of the [[central nervous system]] resulting in pain relief and [[analgesia]]. In the 1970s and '80s, evidence suggesting that opioid drug addicts show increased risk of infection (such as increased [[pneumonia]], [[tuberculosis]], and [[HIV/AIDS]]) led scientists to believe that morphine may also affect the [[immune system]]. This possibility increased interest in the effect of chronic morphine use on the immune system.

The first step of determining that morphine may affect the immune system was to establish that the opiate receptors known to be expressed on cells of the central nervous system are also expressed on cells of the immune system. One study successfully showed that [[dendritic cells]], part of the innate immune system, display opiate receptors. Dendritic cells are responsible for producing [[cytokine]]s, which are the tools for communication in the immune system. This same study showed that dendritic cells chronically treated with morphine during their differentiation produce more [[interleukin-12]] (IL-12), a cytokine responsible for promoting the proliferation, growth, and differentiation of T-cells (another cell of the adaptive immune system) and less [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10), a cytokine responsible for promoting a B-cell immune response (B cells produce antibodies to fight off infection).<ref name="messmer 2006">{{cite journal | vauthors = Messmer D, Hatsukari I, Hitosugi N, Schmidt-Wolf IG, Singhal PC | title = Morphine reciprocally regulates IL-10 and IL-12 production by monocyte-derived human dendritic cells and enhances T cell activation | journal = Molecular Medicine | volume = 12 | issue = 11–12 | pages = 284–90 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17380193 | pmc = 1829197 | doi = 10.2119/2006-00043.Messmer }}</ref>

This regulation of cytokines appear to occur via the [[p38 MAPK pathway|p38 MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinase)-dependent pathway]]. Usually, the p38 within the dendritic cell expresses [[TLR 4]] (toll-like receptor 4), which is activated through the ligand LPS ([[lipopolysaccharide]]). This causes the p38 MAPK to be [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]]. This phosphorylation activates the [[p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases|p38 MAPK]] to begin producing IL-10 and IL-12. When the dendritic cells are chronically exposed to morphine during their differentiation process then treated with LPS, the production of cytokines is different. Once treated with morphine, the p38 MAPK does not produce IL-10, instead favoring production of IL-12. The exact mechanism through which the production of one cytokine is increased in favor over another is not known. Most likely, the morphine causes increased phosphorylation of the p38 MAPK. Transcriptional level interactions between IL-10 and IL-12 may further increase the production of IL-12 once IL-10 is not being produced. This increased production of IL-12 causes increased T-cell immune response.

Further studies on the effects of morphine on the immune system have shown that morphine influences the production of [[neutrophils]] and other [[cytokines]]. Since cytokines are produced as part of the immediate immunological response ([[inflammation]]), it has been suggested that they may also influence pain. In this way, cytokines may be a logical target for analgesic development. Recently, one study has used an animal model (hind-paw incision) to observe the effects of morphine administration on the acute immunological response. Following hind-paw incision, pain thresholds and cytokine production were measured. Normally, cytokine production in and around the wounded area increases in order to fight [[infection]] and control healing (and, possibly, to control pain), but pre-incisional morphine administration (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg to 10.0&nbsp;mg/kg) reduced the number of cytokines found around the wound in a dose-dependent manner. The authors suggest that morphine administration in the acute post-injury period may reduce resistance to infection and may impair the healing of the wound.<ref name="pmid17908329">{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark JD, Shi X, Li X, Qiao Y, Liang D, Angst MS, Yeomans DC | title = Morphine reduces local cytokine expression and neutrophil infiltration after incision | journal = Molecular Pain | volume = 3 | pages = 1744-8069-3-28 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17908329 | pmc = 2096620 | doi = 10.1186/1744-8069-3-28 }}</ref>

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
==== Absorption and metabolism ====
Morphine can be taken [[oral administration|orally]], [[Sublingual administration|sublingually]], [[Buccal space|bucally]], [[rectal administration|rectally]], [[subcutaneous injection|subcutaneously]], [[Insufflation (medicine)|intranasally]], [[intravenous]]ly, [[intrathecal]]ly or [[epidural]]ly and inhaled via a nebulizer. As a recreational drug, it is becoming more common to inhale ("[[Chasing the Dragon]]"), but, for medical purposes, intravenous (IV) injection is the most common method of administration. Morphine is subject to extensive [[first-pass metabolism]] (a large proportion is broken down in the liver), so, if taken orally, only 40% to 50% of the dose reaches the central nervous system. Resultant plasma levels after subcutaneous (SC), intramuscular (IM), and IV injection are all comparable. After IM or SC injections, morphine plasma levels peak in approximately 20&nbsp;min, and, after oral administration, levels peak in approximately 30&nbsp;min.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Trescot AM, Datta S, Lee M, Hansen H | title = Opioid pharmacology | journal = Pain Physician | volume = 11 | issue = 2 Suppl | pages = S133-53 | date = March 2008 | doi = 10.36076/ppj.2008/11/S133 | pmid = 18443637 }}</ref> Morphine is [[metabolised]] primarily in the [[liver]] and approximately 87% of a dose of morphine is excreted in the [[urine]] within 72&nbsp;h of administration.

Morphine can be stored in fat, and, thus, can be detectable even after death. Morphine can cross the [[blood–brain barrier]], but, because of poor lipid solubility, protein binding, rapid conjugation with glucuronic acid and ionization, it does not cross easily.

Morphine and its major metabolites, morphine-3-glucuronide and morphine-6-glucuronide, can be detected in blood, plasma, hair, and urine using an [[immunoassay]]. [[Chromatography]] can be used to test for each of these substances individually. Some testing procedures [[hydrolysis|hydrolyze]] metabolic products into morphine before the immunoassay, which must be considered when comparing morphine levels in separately published results.

The  enzymes involved in this process are the [[salutaridine synthase]], [[Salutaridine reductase (NADPH)|salutaridine:NADPH 7-oxidoreductase]] and the [[codeinone reductase]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors = Novak B, Hudlicky T, Reed J, Mulzer J, Trauner D |title = Morphine Synthesis and Biosynthesis-An Update |journal = Current Organic Chemistry |date = March 2000 |volume = 4 |issue = 3 |pages = 343–362 |doi = 10.2174/1385272003376292 |url = http://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/departments-and-centres/chemistry/faculty/Hudlicky/CurrOrgChem-2000-4-343.pdf |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120619063224/http://brocku.ca/mathematics-science/departments-and-centres/chemistry/faculty/Hudlicky/CurrOrgChem-2000-4-343.pdf |archive-date = 19 June 2012 |df = dmy-all |citeseerx = 10.1.1.515.9096 }}</ref> Researchers are attempting to reproduce the biosynthetic pathway that produces morphine in [[genetically engineered]] [[yeast]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27546-home-brew-heroin-soon-anyone-will-be-able-to-make-illegal-drugs/ |title = Home-brew heroin: soon anyone will be able to make illegal drugs |magazine = New Scientist | first = Michael | last = Le Page | name-list-style = vanc |date = 18 May 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160413033207/https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn27546-home-brew-heroin-soon-anyone-will-be-able-to-make-illegal-drugs/ |archive-date = 13 April 2016 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In June 2015 the ''S''-reticuline could be produced from sugar and ''R''-reticuline could be converted to morphine, but the intermediate reaction could not be performed.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/06/final-step-sugar-morphine-conversion-deciphered |title = Final step in sugar-to-morphine conversion deciphered |publisher = Science | first = Robert F. | last = Service | name-list-style = vanc |date = 25 June 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150821122148/http://news.sciencemag.org/biology/2015/06/final-step-sugar-morphine-conversion-deciphered |archive-date = 21 August 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> In August 2015 the first complete synthesis of thebaine and hydrocodone in yeast were reported, but the process would need to be 100,000 times more productive to be suitable for commercial use.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Galanie S, Thodey K, Trenchard IJ, Filsinger Interrante M, Smolke CD | title = Complete biosynthesis of opioids in yeast | journal = Science | volume = 349 | issue = 6252 | pages = 1095–100 | date = September 2015 | pmid = 26272907 | pmc = 4924617 | doi = 10.1126/science.aac9373 | df = dmy-all | bibcode = 2015Sci...349.1095G }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title = Yeast-Based Opioid Production Completed |url = http://mobile.the-scientist.com/article/43739/yeast-based-opioid-production-completed |access-date = 15 August 2015 |date = 13 August 2015 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150907025856/http://mobile.the-scientist.com/article/43739/yeast-based-opioid-production-completed |archive-date = 7 September 2015 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>

Morphine and most of its derivatives do not exhibit optical isomerism, although some more distant relatives like the morphinan series (levorphanol, dextorphan and the racemic parent chemical racemorphan) do,{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} and as noted above stereoselectivity in vivo is an important issue.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Uses and derivatives===
Most of the licit morphine produced is used to make [[codeine]] by methylation.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} It is also a precursor for many drugs including [[heroin]] (3,6-diacetylmorphine), [[hydromorphone]] (dihydromorphinone), and [[oxymorphone]] (14-hydroxydihydromorphinone).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Most semi-synthetic opioids, both of the morphine and [[codeine]] subgroups, are created by modifying one or more of the following:{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}<!--IF ONE SOURCE COVERS ALL POINTS, PLACE ONE SOURCE. IF IT DOES NOT, PLACE RTH REQUIRED SOURCES FOR EACH BULLET POINT.-->
* Halogenating or making other modifications at positions 1 or 2 on the morphine carbon skeleton.
* The methyl group that makes morphine into codeine can be removed or added back, or replaced with another functional group like ethyl and others to make codeine analogues of morphine-derived drugs and vice versa. Codeine analogues of morphine-based drugs often serve as prodrugs of the stronger drug, as in codeine and morphine, hydrocodone and hydromorphone, oxycodone and oxymorphone, nicocodeine and nicomorphine, dihydrocodeine and dihydromorphine, etc.
* Saturating, opening, or other changes to the bond between positions 7 and 8, as well as adding, removing, or modifying functional groups to these positions; saturating, reducing, eliminating, or otherwise modifying the 7–8 bond and attaching a functional group at 14 yields [[hydromorphinol]]; the oxidation of the hydroxyl group to a carbonyl and changing the 7–8 bond to single from double changes codeine into oxycodone.
* Attachment, removal or modification of functional groups to positions 3 or 6 (dihydrocodeine and related, hydrocodone, nicomorphine); in the case of moving the methyl functional group from position 3 to 6, codeine becomes [[heterocodeine]], which is 72 times stronger, and therefore six times stronger than morphine
* Attachment of functional groups or other modification at position 14 (oxymorphone, oxycodone, naloxone)
* Modifications at positions 2, 4, 5 or 17, usually along with other changes to the molecule elsewhere on the morphine skeleton. Often this is done with drugs produced by catalytic reduction, hydrogenation, oxidation, or the like, producing strong derivatives of morphine and codeine.

Many morphine derivatives can also be manufactured using [[thebaine]] or codeine as a starting material.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Replacement of the ''N''-methyl group of morphine with an ''N''-phenylethyl group results in a product that is 18 times more powerful than morphine in its opiate agonist potency.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Combining this modification with the replacement of the 6-[[hydroxyl]] with a 6-[[methylene group]] produces a compound some 1,443 times more potent than morphine, stronger than the [[Bentley compounds]] such as [[etorphine]] (M99, the Immobilon tranquilliser dart) by some measures.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Closely related to morphine are the opioids morphine-''N''-oxide (genomorphine), which is a pharmaceutical that is no longer in common use;{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} and pseudomorphine, an alkaloid that exists in opium, form as degradation products of morphine.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

<!--The structure-activity relationship of morphine has been extensively studied. THIS SENTENCE IS MEANINGLESS WITHOUT STATEMENT OF WHAT ACTIVITY OR ACTIVITIES ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION.-->As a result of the extensive study and use of this molecule, more than 250 morphine derivatives (also counting codeine and related drugs) have been developed since the last quarter of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} These drugs range from 25% the analgesic strength of codeine (or slightly more than 2% of the strength of morphine) to several thousand times the strength of morphine, to powerful opioid antagonists, including [[naloxone]] (Narcan), [[naltrexone]] (Trexan), [[diprenorphine]] (M5050, the reversing agent for the Immobilon dart) and [[nalorphine]] (Nalline).{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} Some opioid agonist-antagonists, partial agonists, and inverse agonists are also derived from morphine.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}} The receptor-activation profile of the semi-synthetic morphine derivatives varies widely and some, like [[apomorphine]] are devoid of narcotic effects.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

== Production ==
[[File:Alkaloids.png|thumb|upright=1.3|First generation production of alkaloids from licit latex-derived opium]]
In the [[opium poppy]], the alkaloids are bound to [[meconic acid]]. The method is to extract from the crushed plant with diluted sulfuric acid, which is a stronger acid than meconic acid, but not so strong to react with alkaloid molecules. The [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]] is performed in many steps (one amount of crushed plant is extracted at least six to ten times, so practically every [[alkaloid]] goes into the solution). From the solution obtained at the last extraction step, the alkaloids are precipitated by either ammonium hydroxide or sodium carbonate. The last step is purifying and separating morphine from other opium alkaloids. The somewhat similar Gregory process was developed in the United Kingdom during the Second World War, which begins with stewing the entire plant, in most cases save the roots and leaves, in plain or mildly acidified water, then proceeding through steps of concentration, extraction, and purification of alkaloids.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} Other methods of processing "poppy straw" (i.e., dried pods and stalks) use steam, one or more of several types of alcohol, or other organic solvents.

The poppy straw methods predominate in Continental Europe and the British Commonwealth, with the latex method in most common use in India. The latex method can involve either vertical or horizontal slicing of the unripe pods with a two-to five-bladed knife with a guard developed specifically for this purpose to the depth of a fraction of a millimetre and scoring of the pods can be done up to five times. An alternative latex method sometimes used in China in the past is to cut off the poppy heads, run a large needle through them, and collect the dried latex 24 to 48 hours later.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In India, opium harvested by licensed poppy farmers is dehydrated to uniform levels of hydration at government processing centers, and then sold to pharmaceutical companies that extract morphine from the opium. However, in Turkey and Tasmania, morphine is obtained by harvesting and processing the fully mature dry seed pods with attached stalks, called ''poppy straw''.  In Turkey, a water extraction process is used, while in Tasmania, a solvent extraction process is used.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Opium poppy contains at least 50 different alkaloids, but most of them are of very low concentration. Morphine is the principal alkaloid in raw opium and constitutes roughly 8–19% of [[opium]] by dry weight (depending on growing conditions).<ref name="Jenkins AJ 2008" /> Some purpose-developed strains of poppy now produce opium that is up to 26% morphine by weight.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} A rough rule of thumb to determine the morphine content of pulverised dried poppy straw is to divide the percentage expected for the strain or crop via the latex method by eight or an empirically determined factor, which is often in the range of 5 to 15.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} The Norman strain of ''P. Somniferum'', also developed in [[Tasmania]], produces down to 0.04% morphine but with much higher amounts of [[thebaine]] and [[oripavine]], which can be used to synthesise semi-synthetic opioids as well as other drugs like stimulants, emetics, opioid antagonists, anticholinergics, and smooth-muscle agents.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Hungary]] supplied nearly 60% of Europe's total medication-purpose morphine production. To this day, poppy farming is legal in Hungary, but poppy farms are limited by law to {{convert|2|acre|m2}}. It is also legal to sell dried poppy in flower shops for use in floral arrangements.

It was announced in 1973 that a team at the National Institutes of Health in the United States had developed a method for total synthesis of morphine, [[codeine]], and thebaine using coal tar as a starting material. A shortage in codeine-hydrocodone class cough suppressants (all of which can be made from morphine in one or more steps, as well as from codeine or thebaine) was the initial reason for the research.

Most morphine produced for pharmaceutical use around the world is actually converted into codeine as the concentration of the latter in both raw opium and poppy straw is much lower than that of morphine; in most countries, the usage of codeine (both as end-product and precursor) is at least equal or greater than that of morphine on a weight basis.

Throughout Europe there is growing acceptance within the medical community of the use of slow release oral morphine as a substitution treatment alternative to methadone and buprenorphine for patients not able to tolerate the side-effects of buprenorphine and methadone. Slow-release oral morphine has been in widespread use for opiate maintenance therapy in Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia for many years and it is available on a small scale in many other countries including the UK. The long-acting nature of slow-release morphine mimics that of buprenorphine because the sustained blood levels are relatively flat so there is no "high" per se that a patient would feel but rather a sustained feeling of wellness and avoidance of withdrawal symptoms. For patients sensitive to the side-effects that in part may be a result of the unnatural pharmacological actions of buprenorphine and methadone, slow-release oral morphine formulations offer a promising future for use managing opiate addiction.
The pharmacology of heroin and morphine is identical except the two [[acetyl]] groups increase the [[lipophilicity|lipid solubility]] of the heroin molecule, causing heroin to cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] and enter the [[Human brain|brain]] more rapidly in injection. Once in the brain, these acetyl groups are removed to yield morphine, which causes the subjective effects of heroin. Thus, heroin may be thought of as a more rapidly acting form of morphine.<ref name="Klous 2005">{{cite journal | vauthors = Klous MG, Van den Brink W, Van Ree JM, Beijnen JH | title = Development of pharmaceutical heroin preparations for medical co-prescription to opioid dependent patients | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 80 | issue = 3 | pages = 283–95 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 15916865 | doi = 10.1016/j.drugalcdep.2005.04.008 }}</ref>-->

Morphine became a controlled substance in the [[United States|US]] under the [[Harrison Narcotics Tax Act]] of 1914, and possession without a prescription in the US is a criminal offense.
Morphine was the most commonly abused narcotic analgesic in the world until heroin was synthesized and came into use. In general, until the synthesis of [[dihydromorphine]] (ca. 1900), the dihydromorphinone class of opioids (1920s), and [[oxycodone]] (1916) and similar drugs, there were no other drugs in the same efficacy range as opium, morphine, and heroin, with synthetics still several years away ([[pethidine]] was invented in Germany in 1937) and opioid agonists among the semi-synthetics were analogues and derivatives of codeine such as [[dihydrocodeine]] (Paracodin), [[ethylmorphine]] (Dionine), and [[benzylmorphine]] (Peronine). Even today, morphine is the most sought after prescription narcotic by heroin addicts when heroin is scarce, all other things being equal; local conditions and user preference may cause [[hydromorphone]], [[oxymorphone]], high-dose oxycodone, or [[methadone]] as well as [[dextromoramide]] in specific instances such as 1970s Australia, to top that particular list. The stop-gap drugs used by the largest absolute number of heroin addicts is probably codeine, with significant use also of [[dihydrocodeine]], poppy straw derivatives like poppy pod and poppy seed tea, [[propoxyphene]], and [[tramadol]].

The structural formula of morphine was determined by 1925 by [[Robert Robinson (organic chemist)|Robert Robinson]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gulland JM, Robinson R |title=Constitution of codeine and thebaine |journal=Memoirs and Proceedings of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester |date=1925 |volume=69 |pages=79–86}}</ref> At least three methods of total synthesis of morphine from starting materials such as coal tar and petroleum distillates have been patented, the first of which was announced in 1952, by Dr. [[Marshall D.

=== Non-medical use ===
[[File:Morphine DOJ.jpg|thumb|Example of different morphine tablets]]

The euphoria, comprehensive alleviation of distress and therefore all aspects of suffering, promotion of sociability and empathy, "body high", and anxiolysis provided by narcotic drugs including the opioids can cause the use of high doses in the absence of pain for a protracted period, which can impart a morbid craving for the drug in the user. Being the prototype of the entire opioid class of drugs means that morphine has properties that may lead it to misuse. Morphine addiction is the model upon which the current perception of addiction is based.{{medcn|date=October 2015}}

Animal and human studies and clinical experience back up the contention that morphine is one of the most euphoric drugs known, and via all but the IV route heroin and morphine cannot be distinguished according to studies because heroin is a prodrug for the delivery of systemic morphine. Chemical changes to the morphine molecule yield other euphorigenics such as [[dihydromorphine]], [[hydromorphone]] (Dilaudid, Hydal), and [[oxymorphone]] (Numorphan, Opana), as well as the latter three's methylated equivalents [[dihydrocodeine]], [[hydrocodone]], and oxycodone, respectively; in addition to heroin, there are [[dipropanoylmorphine]], [[diacetyldihydromorphine]], and other members of the 3,6 morphine diester category like [[nicomorphine]] and other similar semi-synthetic opiates like [[desomorphine]], [[hydromorphinol]], etc. used clinically in many countries of the world but in many cases also produced illicitly in rare instances.{{medcn|date=October 2015}}

In general, non-medical use of morphine entails taking more than prescribed or outside of medical supervision, injecting oral formulations, mixing it with unapproved potentiators such as alcohol, cocaine, and the like, or defeating the extended-release mechanism by chewing the tablets or turning into a powder for snorting or preparing injectables. The latter method can be as time-consuming and involved as traditional methods of smoking opium. This and the fact that the liver destroys a large percentage of the drug on the first pass impacts the demand side of the equation for clandestine re-sellers, as many customers are not needle users and may have been disappointed with ingesting the drug orally. As morphine is generally as hard or harder to divert than [[oxycodone]] in a lot of cases, morphine in any form is uncommon on the street, although ampoules and phials of morphine injection, pure pharmaceutical morphine powder, and soluble multi-purpose tablets are very popular where available.{{medcn|date=October 2015}}

Morphine is also available in a paste that is used in the production of heroin, which can be smoked by itself or turned to a soluble salt and injected; the same goes for the penultimate products of the Kompot (Polish Heroin) and black tar processes. Poppy straw as well as opium can yield morphine of purity levels ranging from poppy tea to near-pharmaceutical-grade morphine by itself or with all of the more than 50 other alkaloids. It also is the active narcotic ingredient in opium and all of its forms, derivatives, and analogues as well as forming from breakdown of heroin and otherwise present in many batches of illicit heroin as the result of incomplete acetylation.{{medcn|date=October 2015}}

=== Names ===
Morphine is [[marketing|marketed]] under many different [[brand name]]s in various parts of the world.<ref name="drugs.com-page">drugs.com [https://www.drugs.com/international/morphine.html Drugs.com international listings for Morphine] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150614052020/http://www.drugs.com/international/morphine.html |date=14 June 2015 }} Page accessed 2 June 2015</ref> It was formerly called Morphia in British English.<ref>{{cite web |title=Morphia {{!}} Definition of Morphia by Lexico |url=https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/morphia |website=Lexico Dictionaries {{!}} English |access-date=14 September 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

Informal names for morphine include: Cube Juice, Dope, Dreamer, Emsel, First Line, God's Drug, Hard Stuff, Hocus, Hows, Lydia, Lydic, M, Miss Emma, Mister Blue, Monkey, Morf, Morph, Morphide, Morphie, Morpho, Mother, MS, Ms. Emma, Mud, New Jack Swing (if mixed with [[heroin]]), Sister, Tab, Unkie, Unkie White, and Stuff.<ref>{{Cite book |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=G7As-qawdzMC&q=happy+powder&pg=PA95 |title = The Encyclopedia of Addictive Drugs |last = Miller |first = Richard Lawrence |date = 1 January 2002 |publisher = [[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |isbn = 978-0-313-31807-8 |page = 306 |language = en }}</ref>

MS Contin tablets are known as misties, and the 100&nbsp;mg extended-release tablets as greys and blockbusters. The "[[speedball (drug)|speedball]]" can use morphine as the opioid component, which is combined with cocaine, [[amphetamines]], [[methylphenidate]], or similar drugs. "Blue Velvet" is a combination of morphine with the antihistamine [[tripelennamine]] (Pyrabenzamine, PBZ, Pelamine) taken by injection, or less commonly the mixture when swallowed or used as a retention enema; the name is also known to refer to a combination of tripelennamine and dihydrocodeine or codeine tablets or syrups taken by mouth. "Morphia" is an older official term for morphine also used as a slang term. "Driving Miss Emma" is intravenous administration of morphine. Multi-purpose tablets (readily soluble hypodermic tablets that can also be swallowed or dissolved under the tongue or betwixt the cheek and jaw) are known, as are some brands of hydromorphone, as Shake & Bake or Shake & Shoot.

Morphine can be smoked, especially diacetylmorphine (heroin), the most common method being the "Chasing The Dragon" method. To perform acetylation to turn the morphine into heroin and related drugs immediately prior to use is known as AAing (for Acetic Anhydride) or home-bake, and the output of the procedure also known as home-bake or, Blue Heroin (not to be confused with Blue Magic heroin, or the linctus known as Blue Morphine or Blue Morphone, or the Blue Velvet mixture described above).

=== Access in developing countries ===
Although morphine is cheap, people in poorer countries often do not have access to it. According to a 2005 estimate by the [[International Narcotics Control Board]], six countries (Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States) consume 79% of the world's morphine. The less affluent countries, accounting for 80% of the world's population, consumed only about 6% of the global morphine supply.<ref>{{cite book |last1 = Milani |first1 = Barbara | name-list-style = vanc |title = Scholten |publisher = World Health Organization |location = Switzerland |pages = 1–22 |edition = 3rd |url = http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js18062en/ |access-date = 17 January 2018 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180605033251/http://apps.who.int/medicinedocs/en/d/Js18062en/ |archive-date = 5 June 2018 |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Some countries{{which|date=June 2017}} import virtually no morphine, and in others{{which|date=June 2017}} the drug is rarely available even for relieving severe pain while dying.<ref>{{cite document |last1=Human Rights Watch (2011) |title=Global State of Pain Treatment; Access to Palliative Care as a Human Right |date=2 June 2011 |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/06/02/global-state-pain-treatment/access-medicines-and-palliative-care#_ftn22 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |access-date=27 January 2020 |ref=p.1-3}}</ref>

Experts in pain management attribute the under-distribution of morphine to an unwarranted fear of the drug's potential for addiction and abuse. While morphine is clearly addictive, Western doctors believe it is worthwhile to use the drug and then wean the patient off when the treatment is over.<ref>{{cite news | first = Donald G. | last = McNeil Jr | name-list-style = vanc  |title = Drugs Banned, Many of World's Poor Suffer in Pain |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/health/10pain.html?em&ex=1189483200&en=b29a1fe3ba2b3e19&ei=5087%0A |newspaper = New York Times |date = 10 September 2007 |access-date = 11 September 2007 |url-status = live |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115456/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/10/health/10pain.html?em&ex=1189483200&en=b29a1fe3ba2b3e19&ei=5087%0A |archive-date = 11 May 2011 |df = dmy-all }}</ref>
