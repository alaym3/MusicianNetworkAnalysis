'''The Airborne Toxic Event''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band from [[Los Angeles]], California, formed in 2006. It consists of [[Mikel Jollett]] (vocals, guitar, keyboards), Steven Chen (guitar, keyboards), [[Adrian Rodriguez (songwriter)|Adrian Rodriguez]] (electric bass, backing vocals), Daren Taylor (drums), and Miriam "Mimi" Peschet (backing vocals, violin). Anna Bulbrook (vocals, violin) was formerly a member of the band.

Named after a section in [[Don DeLillo]]'s novel ''[[White Noise (novel)|White Noise]]'', the group is known for its blend of rock music and orchestral arrangements, having performed frequently with the Calder Quartet, a string quartet based in Los Angeles. The group has also played concerts with the [[Louisville Orchestra]] and the [[Colorado Symphony Orchestra]].

==History==

===Formation and early years (2006–2007)===
Initially a writer and essayist, Jollett began seriously writing songs with an acoustic guitar following a week in March 2006, during which he underwent a break-up, learned his mother had been diagnosed with [[cancer]], and was himself diagnosed with a genetic [[autoimmune disease]] that led to the development of two cosmetic conditions: [[Alopecia areata]] and [[Vitiligo]]. This quick succession of traumatic events spurred a period of intense songwriting, and it was around this time that he first met Taylor through a mutual friend in [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles]].<ref>{{cite news | title=Taking the L.A. indie rock scene personally | url=http://theguide.latimes.com/general/latcl-taking-the-l-a-indie-rock-scene-article | last=Bronson | first=Kevin | series=The Guide | work=[[The Los Angeles Times]] | date=2007-08-25 | access-date=2009-05-29}}{{dead link|date=June 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} </ref> [[File:Airborne sm 72s.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Airborne Toxic Event at [[The Saint (music venue)|The Saint]] in [[Asbury Park, NJ]], March 2009]]

Throughout the summer of 2006, Jollett and Taylor rehearsed several of Jollett's songs, including early incarnations of "Wishing Well," "Missy," and "Innocence," which would eventually appear on the band's debut album. After a few months of rehearsals, Jollett ran into [[Anna Bulbrook]] one night at El Gran Burrito, a popular outdoor [[Mexican cuisine|Mexican]] restaurant in Silver Lake. Trained in [[orchestral]] and [[chamber music]], she had just moved to Los Angeles from [[New York City]]. Though they were just acquaintances at the time, he remembered that she played the [[violin]] and asked her to attend one of his and Taylor's rehearsals. Afraid to bring her more expensive violin to a rock rehearsal, she agreed to bring her viola instead. Jollett then asked Harmon, a [[Tucson]] native and graduate of the Herb Alpert School of Music at the [[California Institute of the Arts]], to join his fledgling band, having seen him perform in Los Angeles with other acts and been impressed with his background in rock and [[jazz]], as well as his skill with the upright bass. At the time, Harmon was performing with multiple rock and jazz bands while teaching guitar to children both in [[East Los Angeles, California|East Los Angeles]] as part of CalArts' Community Arts Partnership, and at Arroyo Seco Park (Highland Park, CA) as part of its "Art in the Park" program. He refused at first, and it wasn't until months later—after several shows—that Harmon agreed to join the group full-time. Chen and Jollett, meanwhile, had already known each other for five years. They first met through a mutual friend while both were living in [[San Francisco]] and working as writers. After a few years of living in New York, Chen made a return to his hometown of Los Angeles, upon which Jollett contacted him and asked if he'd be interested in playing the keyboard in the band. Chen replied that he, in fact, played guitar and eventually filled the role as lead guitarist.

Prior to the formation of the band, and to supplement his [[fiction]] writing, Jollett supported himself as a freelance writer, contributing to [[NPR]], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[Filter (magazine)|Filter]]'' and ''[[Men's Health (magazine)|Men's Health]]'', among other organizations. Soon after the formation of the band, he concentrated only on fiction. In the summer of 2008, ''[[McSweeney's]]'' issue 27 published one of Jollett's short stories, ''The Crack'', which appeared between short stories by Liz Mandrell and [[Stephen King]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.detail/object_id/aa5ec80d-0bc9-45ea-9bce-275ed0c28bb9/McSweeneysIssue27.cfm |title=McSweeney's Issue 27 - The McSweeney's Store |publisher=Store.mcsweeneys.net |access-date=2015-07-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114140600/http://store.mcsweeneys.net/index.cfm/fuseaction/catalog.detail/object_id/aa5ec80d-0bc9-45ea-9bce-275ed0c28bb9/McSweeneysIssue27.cfm |archive-date=2012-01-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In keeping with his literary background, Jollett named the band after a section of the postmodern novel ''[[White Noise (novel)|White Noise]]'' by [[Don DeLillo]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicvice.com/interviews/theairbornetoxicevent_september2008.html |title=Music Vice Features - The Airborne Toxic Event interview |publisher=Musicvice.com |date=2008-09-16 |access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref> which won the [[National Book Award]] in 1985. In the book, a chemical spill from a railcar releases a poisonous cloud, dubbed by the military and media as an "airborne toxic event." The reason for choosing this as the name of the band, he has stated, is that the event described in the novel triggers a fear of death and a sense of mortality that fundamentally alters the protagonist's outlook on himself, his family, and his life. The band was born of a similar life-altering sequence of events, and thus, the themes of mortality and [[media consumption]] that arise from the novel's toxic cloud serve as a major impetus for the band's creative drive.

The Airborne Toxic Event played its first show at the Echo, a venue in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles, California|Echo Park]], in October 2006—less than a month after it was fully formed. The show was well attended, and the following month, the band played the [[CMJ Music Marathon]]. In December 2006, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named the group one of the "Top 25 Bands on [[MySpace]]."<ref>{{cite web|last=Dunkerley |first=Beville |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/12/22/rolling-stone-declares-the-25-best-bands-on-myspace/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106160452/http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2006/12/22/rolling-stone-declares-the-25-best-bands-on-myspace |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 6, 2007 |title=Music &#124; New Music News, Reviews, Pictures, and Videos |publisher=Rolling Stone |access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref> The band went on to receive positive feedback and reviews from music blogs and press, most notably the ''[[L.A. Weekly]]''<ref>[http://www.laweekly.com/music/diggin-your-scene/the-airborne-toxic-event/15856/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417023858/http://www.laweekly.com/music/diggin-your-scene/the-airborne-toxic-event/15856/ |date=April 17, 2008 }}</ref> and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'',<ref>{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/buzzbands/2007/02/that_sound_you_.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Buzz Bands: ''Los Angeles Times''}}</ref> the latter of which named the group one of the top three L.A. bands to watch in 2008. Previous bands to receive this distinction include [[Cold War Kids]] and [[Silversun Pickups]].

In the summer of 2007, the U.K. indie label Square Records released a 7-inch single of the Airborne Toxic Event song "Does This Mean You Are Moving On?" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.myspace.com/video/theairbornetoxicevent/the-airborne-toxic-event-does-this-mean-you-39-re-moving-on/10262076 |title=Video The Airborne Toxic Event - Does this mean you're moving on? van The Airborne Toxic Event - Myspace Video |publisher=Myspace.com |date=2007-06-07 |access-date=2012-03-28}}</ref> To support the release, the band embarked on a ten-day tour of the U.K., playing shows in [[London]] and [[Brighton]]. Upon returning, the band recorded 14 tracks with producer Pete Min at his home studio in the [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles]], while continuing to perform around Los Angeles. Ten of the tracks recorded at Min's home would later comprise the band's debut album.

In December 2007, the band premiered the song "Sometime Around Midnight" with a live performance of the song on  [[Indie 103.1]]'s local music show ''[[Mr. Shovel's Check One Two|Check One Two]]''. In January 2008, the band played a five-show weekly residency presented by  [[Indie 103.1]] at the popular Silver Lake venue [[Spaceland]], chronicled in a short [[YouTube]] video titled "Thursdays in January".<ref>{{cite web|title=Thursdays in January w/the Airborne Toxic Event|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wxVx4s5GiCM}}</ref> During the second-to-last week of the residency, Los Angeles commercial radio stations [[KROQ-FM]] and Indie 103.1 ([[KDLD]]) officially added the as-yet-unsigned band's song "Sometime Around Midnight" to regular rotation. [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]]'s [[WBRU]],  [[Seattle]]'s [[KEXP-FM]], [[San Francisco|San Francisco's]] Live 105 ([[KITS]]), [[San Diego|San Diego's]] 91X ([[XETRA-FM]]), [[Boston]]'s [[WFNX (101.7 FM)|WFNX]], and Sacramento's [[KWOD]] 106.5 soon followed suit, showing significant support for the group.

In April 2008, after an extensive courtship from major labels, the Airborne Toxic Event signed with the indie label [[Majordomo Records]], based in Los Angeles. Soon after that, on April 24, the band made its national television debut as the musical guest on the late-night [[NBC]] talk show ''[[Last Call with Carson Daly]]''.

===''The Airborne Toxic Event'' (2008–2009)===
On August 5, 2008, the band released its first full-length album, ''[[The Airborne Toxic Event (album)|The Airborne Toxic Event]]'', featuring ten of the 14 songs recorded at Min's home studio at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008. On August 1, coinciding with the release, the group performed "Sometime Around Midnight" on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.

[[File:04 cool3 smlt2sm.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Onstage at [[The Saint (music venue)|The Saint]] in [[Asbury Park, NJ]], March 2009]]

The record was received with mostly favorable reviews from such outlets as the [[Los Angeles Times]], [[Newsweek]], [[Q (magazine)|Q]], [[Entertainment Weekly]], and [[Drowned in Sound]], among others. Notably, the [[Boston Herald]] named the band's album "The Debut Album of the Year."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.instantencore.com/buzz/item.aspx?FeedEntryId=121413 |title=The Airborne Toxic Event Joins Forces With Colorado Symphony For Rare, Unforgettable Concert Experience |publisher=InstantEncore |access-date=2012-03-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006074011/http://www.instantencore.com/buzz/item.aspx?FeedEntryId=121413 |archive-date=2011-10-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In addition, on December 6, 2008, [[iTunes]] named "Sometime Around Midnight" the No.&nbsp;1 Alternative Song of the Year on their Best of 2008 list.<ref>{{cite web|last=Airborne |first=The |url=http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/news/news-itunes-1-alternative-song-of-the-year.html |title=NEWS: iTunes No.&nbsp;1 Alternative Song of the Year |publisher=The Airborne Toxic Event |date=2008-12-06 |access-date=2012-03-28}}</ref> One exception was the review on the music website [[Pitchfork Media]], by Ian Cohen, who gave the record 1.6 out of 10 stars and accused the band of imitating the worst aspects of bands such as [[Arcade Fire]], [[The Strokes]], and [[Interpol (band)|Interpol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/12191-the-airborne-toxic-event/ |title=The Airborne Toxic Event: The Airborne Toxic Event &#124; Album Reviews |publisher=Pitchfork |date=2008-09-17 |access-date=2012-03-28}}</ref> In response, the band released a statement saying that it does not take reviews too seriously and criticized Pitchfork for basing their critiques on "a band's ability to match a certain indie rock aesthetic" rather than a band's other merits, and claiming that much of the review "reads less like a record review and more like a diatribe against a set of ill-considered and borderline offensive preconceptions about Los Angeles".<ref>{{cite web|title=An Open Letter to Pitchfork Media from the Airborne Toxic Event|url=http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/news/open-letter-to-pitchfork-media-from-the-airborne-toxic-event.html}}</ref>

To promote the album, the band released a series of one-take acoustic videos for each song on the record, filmed in different locations around Los Angeles. Each video was released in the order of the track listing on the album each week, with the final video ("Innocence") released in the first week of August to coincide with the album release. Some of the locations included the [[Los Angeles River]], [[Griffith Park]], and the [[Colburn School]] Conservatory of Music. Two of the acoustic videos featured the band performing in moving vehicles; "Does This Mean You’re Moving On?" was performed in a car on [[Sunset Boulevard]], while "Something New" was performed on a boat at [[Marina Del Rey]] with Taylor both steering the boat and tapping a snare drum with his free hand.

Beginning in July 2008, the band embarked on a series of tours in support of the album, which continued for approximately a year and a half. After touring various summer festivals, the band embarked on a North American tour opening for [[The Fratellis]] in the fall of 2008.

Following that, the group played its "30 Shows in 30 Days" tour of the [[United Kingdom]] in November, during which it performed 30 nights in a row entirely in [[England]] and [[Scotland]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Airborne |first=The |url=http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/news/november-uk-tour-30-shows-in-30-days.html |title=November UK Tour: 30 Shows In 30 Days |publisher=The Airborne Toxic Event |date=2008-09-29 |access-date=2012-03-28}}</ref> The tour incorporated a month-long residency at the Dublin Castle, located in London's [[Camden Town]]. The band has largely attributed its subsequent success in the U.K. to this tour, which also included shows in [[Derby]], [[York]],  [[Birmingham]], [[Northampton]], [[Leicester]], [[Aldershot]], [[Yeovil]], [[Hayle]], [[Southampton]], [[Liverpool]], [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Middlesbrough]], [[Manchester]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]], [[Oxford]], [[Brighton]], [[Nottingham]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]], [[Cardiff]], [[Bristol]], [[Sheffield]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]], [[Dundee]], [[Glasgow]], and [[Fife]].

In January 2009, the Airborne Toxic Event embarked on its first headlining tour, beginning in the U.K., followed by two months in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Meanwhile, bolstered by an unexpected addition to the playlist at the U.K.’s [[BBC Radio 1]]—an unusual occurrence for an unsigned American band—the group released its debut through an independent distributor in the UK on February 9, 2009. Also during this time, the group began performing on television with the Calder Quartet, a Los Angeles-based string quartet featuring Bulbrook’s brother on second violin. The quartet had previously played with the band for its record-release show at the [[El Rey Theatre]] in Los Angeles in August 2008, as well as appearing in two of its one-take acoustic videos, for "Sometime Around Midnight" and "Innocence". They joined the band for three television performances during the first half of 2009, including the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on January 16, 2009, ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on April 14, 2009, and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' on May 14, 2009. Soon after the Letterman performance, which garnered worldwide attention, the band's single “Sometime Around Midnight" entered the top 10 on the US Alternative Radio Chart.

The band toured almost constantly for the remainder of the year, throughout North America, the U.K., and continental Europe, performing during the summer at several festivals, including [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Lollapalooza]], [[T in the Park]], [[Fuji Rock]], the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]], [[Oxegen]], [[Latitude Festival]], [[FM4 Frequency Festival]], [[Pukkelpop]], [[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise]], and the [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]]. The group's final tour for its debut album began on September 17, 2009 in [[Pomona, California]] and concluded in [[Oxford]], U.K. on November 14. By the end of 2009, "Sometime Around Midnight" was the No.&nbsp;10 Most Played Song at Alternative Radio for the year. It peaked at No.&nbsp;4 and sold over 400,000 copies in the US. The band's debut album spent 8 weeks at No.&nbsp;1 on Billboard's Heatseekers Chart (53 weeks in total on the chart) and has sold over 200,000 copies domestically and 300,000 worldwide.

Due to this constant touring Jollett admitted that his writing career had to be put on hold. While he was writing an original novel in the early years of the formation of the band, the stresses and time constraint of touring made it nearly impossible to continue his current works.

The group made five music videos for the album: "Does This Mean You’re Moving On?", directed by Jason Wishnow; "Happiness is Overrated", directed by Jon Danovic; "Gasoline", directed by Billy Johnson; and "Sometime Around Midnight", for which there were two separate videos, directed by Wishnow and [[D. J. Caruso]].

In early March 2009, the Airborne Toxic Event signed with [[Island Records]].

On March 10, 2009, during a live radio broadcast with [[U2]] at the [[Metro Chicago]], host [[Shirley Manson]] of [[Garbage (band)|Garbage]] asked the band to name some of its favorite songs. Bassist [[Adam Clayton]] chose "Sometime Around Midnight" as one of his selections, commenting that he felt he would be listening to their album the rest of the year.<ref>{{cite web|title=U2 Catching the Airborne Toxic Event|url=http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/031209tate|publisher=Digitalmusicnews.com|access-date=2015-07-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312065437/http://www.digitalmusicnews.com/stories/031209tate|archive-date=2012-03-12}}</ref>  During its [[U2 360° Tour]], U2 made a habit of playing a recording of the song in stadiums before taking the stage.

On May 20, 2009, an entire episode of ''Last Call with Carson Daly'' was devoted to the Airborne Toxic Event, featuring interviews and excerpts from a show at the Glass House in Pomona, California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/news/carson-daly-tonight.html |title=Carson Daly tonight... |publisher=The Airborne Toxic Event |date=2009-05-20 |access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref>

On December 4, 2009, the Airborne Toxic Event played its final show in support of its debut album, giving a sold-out performance at the [[Frank Gehry]]-designed [[Walt Disney Concert Hall]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]]. The show was presented by the [[Los Angeles Philharmonic]] and was the last of 354 shows performed by the band on its debut album cycle. The group was accompanied by the Calder Quartet, the [[Lalo Guerrero]] Children's choir, [[Belmont High School (Los Angeles, California)|The Belmont High School]] marching band, Mexican [[Baile Folklorico]] dancers, and a number of guest musicians, including horn players and an accordionist.

==="Neda", ''All I Ever Wanted: Live from Walt Disney Concert Hall'' (2010)===
On June 7, 2010, the Airborne Toxic Event released a song and video titled "Neda," in recognition of the one-year anniversary of the [[Death of Neda Agha-Soltan]], the young Iranian woman who was killed during the protests of the disputed 2009 presidential election of [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] in [[Iran]]. In conjunction with [[Amnesty International]], the band also launched a website, nedaspeaks.org, to raise awareness about Agha-Soltan's death and the human rights struggle in Iran. The music video features a series of animated stills depicting the events surrounding Agha-Soltan's death, interspersed with text.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Airborne Toxic Event - Neda|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXN_yCSbUYk|publisher=Youtube.com|access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref>  [[File:ATE guitar 032011 sm.jpg|thumb|left|200px| Concert in [[Asbury Park, NJ]], March 2009]]

As part of its website, the band encouraged visitors to submit a photo of themselves holding a sign reading "I am Neda." Celebrities who participated in the project include [[Alyssa Milano]], [[Paul Haggis]], and [[Ne-Yo]], among others. All proceeds from the sale of the single on iTunes were donated to Amnesty International. In addition, the band held a benefit concert at the Echo in Los Angeles on May 25, 2010. One of the attendees at the show was [[Jimmy Delshad]], mayor of [[Beverly Hills]] and the highest-ranking [[Iranian American]] elected official in the United States.

On July 14, 2010, the band announced the release of the documentary DVD and CD ''All I Ever Wanted: Live From Walt Disney Concert Hall'', on September 7, 2010 in North America and October 4, 2010 in Europe. The North American release date was later moved to September 29, 2010. The film premiered at the Vista Theatre in the Los Feliz, Los Angeles on September 2, 2010, at the Sunshine Theater in New York on September 9, and at the [[Raindance Film Festival]] in London on September 30.

The film, directed by Danovic, features the Airborne Toxic Event's December 4, 2009 Walt Disney Concert Hall performance in its entirety, interspersed with a behind-the-scenes narrative chronicling the band's extensive preparations for the show. The non-concert footage includes extensive rehearsals with the Calder Quartet, the Belmont High School marching band, and the Lalo Guerrero children's choir. Stylistically, the film splices rehearsal footage with concert footage for most of the songs performed, in addition to switching between black-and-white and color video. The performance features non-album tracks, including the title track "All I Ever Wanted," "A Letter to Georgia," "Duet," and "This Losing." It also includes cover versions of "[[Goodbye Horses]]," by [[Q Lazzarus]], "The Book of Love" by [[The Magnetic Fields]], and "[[Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?]]" by the [[Ramones]]. The DVD release also includes an additional CD containing an audio recording of the entire concert.

In support of the DVD release, the group spent September and October 2010 on a sold-out, three-week North American and U.K. acoustic tour, with the Calder Quartet joining them for the North American leg of the tour. They performed at a series of non-traditional venues, including the [[Sixth & I|Sixth & I Synagogue]] in Washington D.C., [[Town Hall (New York, New York)|Town Hall]] in New York, [[Church of the Holy Trinity (Toronto)|Trinity Church]] in Toronto, the [[John Anson Ford Amphitheatre]] in Los Angeles, and the [[Union Chapel, Islington|Union Chapel]]  in London.  In John Earls [[News of the World]] review of the Union Chapel show, he  wrote "Debuting seven terrific new songs to make the heart soar, Toxic's stirring tunes certainly get in the bloodstream."

===''All at Once'' (2011–2012)===
The Airborne Toxic Event's second album, ''[[All at Once (The Airborne Toxic Event album)|All at Once]]'', was released on April 25, 2011 in Europe, and April 26 in North America. Written during the latter half of 2009 and most of 2010, the record was produced in Los Angeles by [[Dave Sardy]], who also produced albums by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], [[Band of Horses]], [[LCD Soundsystem]], [[Wolfmother]], and [[Autolux]]. An acoustic version of one of the songs from the album, "Half of Something Else," appeared on the soundtrack for the film ''[[Going the Distance (2010 film)|Going the Distance]]'', directed by [[Nanette Burstein]] and starring [[Drew Barrymore]] and [[Justin Long]].

On January 22, 2011, the band played a concert with the Colorado Symphony Orchestra at [[Boettcher Concert Hall]] in [[Denver]], debuting orchestral arrangements of songs from ''All at Once'', in addition to those from the first record.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metromix, Denver - The Airborne Toxic Event, Colorado Symphony team up for epic Denver concert|url=http://denver.metromix.com/music/essay_photo_gallery/the-airborne-toxic-event/2416095/photo/2416134|publisher=Denver.metromix.com|access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref> Previously, it performed with the Louisville Orchestra at [[The Kentucky Center]] for the Performing Arts’ Whitney Hall on January 30, 2010, as part of the orchestra's "BB&T Strings Attached" series.<ref>{{cite web|title=Metromix, Louisville - Music's the best medicine for the band Airborne Toxic Event|url=http://louisville.metromix.com/music/article/musics-the-best-medicine/1732115/content|publisher=Louisville.metromix.com|access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref> [[File:Mikelanna.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Mikel & Anna - Ace of Spades venue in Sacramento, CA, June 2011]]

On February 1, 2011, the Airborne Toxic Event released two separate first singles from the album in North America and Europe, respectively. In North America, the single was "Changing", while in Europe, it was "Numb". In its October 9, 2010 issue, ''Music Week'' wrote, "The LA group's new material is the sound of a band defining their identity. Produced by Dave Sardy, this is confident, ambitious and radio-friendly."<ref>{{cite web|title=Music Week - The Playlist|url=http://www.musicweek.com/hybrid.asp?navcode=81181&pubcode=1&typecode=19&subtypecode=194|publisher=Musicweek.com|access-date=2015-07-29}}</ref>

Also on February 1, 2011, the band embarked on a one-month tour of continental Europe, composed partly of three simultaneous musical residencies in [[Amsterdam]] (Mondays), [[Berlin]] (Tuesdays), and [[Paris]] (Fridays). Other cities visited on the tour, on Wednesdays and Thursdays, were [[Antwerp]], [[Münster]], [[Hamburg]], [[Munich]], [[Cologne]], [[Frankfurt]], and [[Zurich]]. In addition, the band played [[HMV Group]]'s Next Big Thing music festival at [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]] in London on February 10.<ref>{{cite web|last=Airborne |first=The |url=http://www.theairbornetoxicevent.com/news/new-shows-announced-multiple-european-residencies-in-february-plus-a-special-performance-with-the-colorado-symphony-in-denver-jan-22-2.html |title=NEW SHOWS ANNOUNCED: Multiple European Residencies in February, plus a special performance with the Colorado Symphony in Denver, Jan 22 |publisher=The Airborne Toxic Event |date=2010-12-17 |access-date=2012-03-28}}</ref>
