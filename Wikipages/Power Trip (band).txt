{{missing information|the band's early years|date=May 2021}}
In 2013, the band signed with the [[Southern Lord Records]] label and released their first studio album, ''[[Manifest Decimation]]''.<ref name="allmusic"/> Their second album, ''[[Nightmare Logic]]'', was released in 2017 to critical acclaim.<ref>{{cite web|title=NIGHTMARE LOGIC by Power Trip|url=http://www.metacritic.com/music/nightmare-logic/power-trip|website=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|access-date=26 March 2018}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' mentioned that singer Riley Gale's lyrics on ''Nightmare Logic'', were about "social inequality and activism". He described ''Nightmare Logic'' as "dealing with this waking nightmare, things seem so surreal that they're unbelievable … trying to find optimism and a motivating force and realising that the 99% of us have more in common than we think".<ref name="galeguardian" /> The success of ''Nightmare Logic'', as well as sharing the stage with the likes of [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]], [[Exodus (American band)|Exodus]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Dirty Rotten Imbeciles|D.R.I.]], [[Suicidal Tendencies]], [[Napalm Death]], [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]], [[Hatebreed]], [[Five Finger Death Punch]], [[Opeth]], [[Danzig (band)|Danzig]] and [[Obituary (band)|Obituary]],<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lim|first1=Cherrie|title=Power Trip's Riley Gale passes away at age 34, leaves fans and friends devastated|url=https://www.bandwagon.asia/articles/power-trip-s-riley-gale-passes-away-at-age-34-leaves-fans-and-friends-devastated-2020|publisher=Bandwagon|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Riley Gale Of Power Trip Has Died|url=https://oanow.com/people/power-trip-vocalist-riley-gale-dies-aged-35/article_a334971f-631b-5289-b0a9-af415b75de1f.html|publisher=[[Opelika-Auburn News]]|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Power Trip' lead singer Riley Gale passes away|url=https://www.bignewsnetwork.com/news/266210735/power-trip-lead-singer-riley-gale-passes-away|publisher=[[Big News Network]]|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Riley Gale, Singer for Thrash Band Powertrip Dead at 34|url=https://www.funkymooserecords.ca/blogs/music-news/riley-gale-singer-for-thrash-band-powertrip-dead-at-34|publisher=Funky Moose Records|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Obituary, Exodus & Power Trip announce tour|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/obituary-exodus-power-trip-announce-tour/|publisher=[[BrooklynVegan]]|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref> helped Power Trip become one of the most popular thrash metal bands in the 2010s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Konstantinos|first1=Pappis|title=Power Trip's Riley Gale Dies at 34|url=https://ourculturemag.com/2020/08/26/power-trips-riley-gale-dies-at-34/|publisher=Our Culture Mag|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Deville|first1=Chris|title=Riley Gale Of Power Trip Has Died|url=https://www.stereogum.com/2095976/power-trip-riley-gale-dead-at-35/obit/|publisher=Stereogum|access-date=27 August 2020}}</ref>

At the time of Gale's death, Power Trip was on the bill for a European tour with [[Lamb of God (band)|Lamb of God]] and [[Kreator]], which was originally scheduled to take place in the spring of 2020 before the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] resulted in the tour being rescheduled to late 2021 and again to late 2022; the band was eventually replaced by [[Thy Art Is Murder]] and [[Gatecreeper]].<ref>{{cite web|title=LAMB OF GOD And KREATOR Announce Spring 2020 European Co-Headlining Tour|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lamb-of-god-and-kreator-announce-spring-2020-european-co-headlining-tour/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=September 3, 2019|date=April 25, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LAMB OF GOD And KREATOR Announce Rescheduled Dates For 'State Of Unrest' European Tour|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lamb-of-god-and-kreator-announce-rescheduled-dates-for-state-of-unrest-european-tour/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=September 10, 2020|date=July 31, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=LAMB OF GOD And KREATOR Postpone 'State Of Unrest' European Tour To Fall 2022|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/lamb-of-god-and-kreator-postpone-state-of-unrest-european-tour-to-fall-2022/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=October 27, 2021|date=October 27, 2021}}</ref>

In a March 2021 interview with ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', the surviving members of Power Trip stated that they are unsure of the band's future, but have not ruled out the possibility of continuing in Gale's memory. Lead guitarist Blake Ibanez commented, "We do want to continue to play music together; we just are not sure what that looks like at this time."<ref>{{cite web|title=For the surviving members of metal band Power Trip, the Grammys are a bittersweet coda|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/music/story/2021-03-11/power-trip-riley-gale-grammys/|website=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=March 12, 2021|date=March 11, 2021}}</ref>

Gale said that he worked hard to do concise lyrics: "each word relates to the sentence, and how the sentence relates to the verse. Making sure everything's connected and there's not a syllable wasted." "I try to write something that's catchy that people can sing along to mindlessly". "[I write about] the frustrations with what I see.
