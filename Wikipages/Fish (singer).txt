'''Derek William Dick''' (born 25 April 1958), better known by his stage name '''Fish''', is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] singer-songwriter and occasional actor.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=464/5}}</ref>

Fish became widely known as the lead singer and lyricist of the [[neo-progressive rock]] band [[Marillion]] from 1981 until 1988.<ref name="Larkin"/> He released 11 UK Top 40 singles with the band, including the Top Ten singles "[[Kayleigh]]", "[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]" and "[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]", and five Top Ten albums, including a number-one with ''[[Misplaced Childhood]]''.<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=349|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref> In his solo career, Fish has explored contemporary [[pop music|pop]] and traditional [[folk music|folk]],<ref name="prasad"/> and released a further five Top 40 singles and a Top 10 album.<ref>{{cite book |editor=David Roberts |title=British Hit Singles and Albums|year=2006|page=201|publisher=Guinness World Records Limited|isbn=978-1904994107}}</ref>

Fish's voice has been described as both "distinct" and a "conflation of [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]",<ref name="Seasons End review">{{cite web | url= http://www.allmusic.com/album/seasons-end-mw0000205251 | title= Seasons End | website=AllMusic | first=Jeri | last=Montesano | access-date=8 August 2014}}</ref><ref name="Hepworth">[[David Hepworth]]'s review of [[Clutching at Straws]].

==Early life==
Derek William Dick was born on 25 April 1958 in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland, and grew up in [[Dalkeith]].<ref name="Larkin"/> The son of Robert and Isabella, Fish was educated at King's Park primary school and then [[Dalkeith High School]]. He was inspired by the music of many of the rock artists of the late 1960s and early 1970s, including [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[the Moody Blues]], [[the Kinks]], [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[David Bowie]], [[Argent (band)|Argent]] and [[Alex Harvey (musician)|the Alex Harvey Band]] (Fish would later pay tribute to these early influences on his covers album ''[[Songs from the Mirror]]''). Fish has also cited Canadian singer-songwriter [[Joni Mitchell]] as "one of the biggest influences on me because of her approach to lyrics".<ref>{{cite web | url= http://thequietus.com/articles/12274-fish-marillion-favourite-albums?page=4 | title= This Must Be The Plaice: Fish's Favourite Albums | work=The Quietus | date=20 May 2013 | access-date=19 July 2015}}</ref> The first band he saw live was [[Yes (band)|Yes]] at Usher Hall, Edinburgh, in 1974. As well as his love for music, he was also a voracious reader, and his literary inspirations included [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Truman Capote]], [[Robert Burns]] and [[Dylan Thomas]] (all of whom would later be depicted on the sleeve of Marillion's ''[[Clutching at Straws]]'').

Fish worked as a [[Filling station|petrol pump]] attendant, [[gardener]], and from 1977 until 1980 worked in [[forestry]] at the Bowhill Estate in [[Selkirk, Scottish Borders|Selkirk]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fish-thecompany.com/bio.htm?rdctd=1 |title=Official Fish site: Biographies – Fish |publisher=Fish-thecompany.com |access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref> While living in [[Fochabers]], [[Moray]]<ref>{{cite book |last= Beech|first=Mark|date=2009|title=The Dictionary of Rock & Pop Names |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kbbNDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT181 |publisher=Pen and Sword|page=181|isbn= 978-1844689095}}</ref> he adopted the nickname of Fish, which originated from a landlord who lamented the amount of time he spent in the bath.<ref name="Larkin"/> Fish has been quoted: "With a real name of Derek William Dick, it became very necessary to find a nickname as quickly as possible."<ref name="December 1999 interview">{{cite web |title=Fish – December 1999 Interview |url=http://www.fish-thecompany.com/int/int36.htm|website=Fish-thecompany.com|access-date=6 June 2008 }}</ref> 

He first performed as a singer in 1980: "The very first gig I ever did as a singer was in Gala [Galashiels] in the Golden Lion pub."<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|url=https://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/rock-star-fish-humbled-by-lyrics-carved-into-new-gala-stonework-1-2418978|title=Rock star Fish 'humbled' by lyrics carved into new Gala stonework|website=Thesouthernreporter.co.uk|access-date=12 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713174904/https://www.thesouthernreporter.co.uk/news/rock-star-fish-humbled-by-lyrics-carved-into-new-gala-stonework-1-2418978|archive-date=13 July 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>
He moved to [[Church Laneham]], Notts in mid 1980 following a successful audition for the Stone Dome Band, and then to [[Aylesbury]] at the start of 1981 in the process of joining [[Marillion]].

==Marillion==
Fish joined [[Marillion]] in 1981.<ref name="Larkin"/> The band gained popularity over the next couple of years, leading to the release of their top-ten debut album ''[[Script for a Jester's Tear]]'' in 1983. They achieved further chart success in the UK, attaining top-ten hit singles in 1985 with "[[Kayleigh]]" and "[[Lavender (Marillion song)|Lavender]]", and again in 1987 with "[[Incommunicado (song)|Incommunicado]]". In 1988, due to the stress of touring and the detrimental effect it was having on his health, as well as having a falling out with bandmate Steve Rothery <ref name="Clutching at Straws sleeve notes">{{cite news |title=Clutching at Straws sleeve notes |url=http://fish-thecompany.com/email/stcas.htm |access-date=19 August 2020}}</ref>
Fish left Marillion to pursue a solo career.<ref name="Larkin"/>
Lyrics from the song "[[Kayleigh]]" were etched into paving stones in Market Square in [[Galashiels]] in 2012. The lines "stilettoes in the snow", and "moon-washed college halls" were inspired by Fish's girlfriend of the time, who was at the Scottish College of Textiles in Galashiels in the 1980s.

==Solo career==

Fish’s debut solo album ''[[Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors]]'' was released in January 1990. Several well known musicians contributed to the album, including former [[Dire Straits]] guitarist [[Hal Lindes]], who played guitar on most tracks and also contributed to the writing of three of the album’s songs. [[Frank Usher]], a Fish companion from pre-Marillion times, also contributed. Drums were played by [[Mark Brzezicki]] ([[Big Country]]) and [[John Keeble]] ([[Spandau Ballet]]), [[John Giblin]] contributed bass and [[Luís Jardim]] contributed additional percussion. Backing vocals came from [[Tessa Niles]], who had appeared on ''[[Clutching at Straws]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors - Fish {{!}} Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vigil-in-a-wilderness-of-mirrors-mw0000663256/credits |website=AllMusic |access-date=31 January 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Vigil in a Wilderness of Mirrors - Fish {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/vigil-in-a-wilderness-of-mirrors-mw0000663256 |website=AllMusic |access-date=31 January 2020 |language=en-us}}</ref> Fish also composed the theme music for the 1990s BBC TV series [[Between the Lines (TV series)|''Between the Lines'']].<ref>{{cite web |title=Between the Lines Theme - Hal Lindes {{!}} Song Info {{!}} AllMusic |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/between-the-lines-theme-mt0034252108 |access-date=21 April 2021 |language=en |quote=Composed by Hal Lindes}}</ref>

Many of Fish's later works contain lengthy [[spoken word|spoken-word]] lyrics, shorter examples of which can be heard on earlier Marillion albums. Fish has collaborated with [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] founder [[Tony Banks (musician)|Tony Banks]] on his ''[[Still (Tony Banks album)|Still]]'' and ''[[Soundtracks (Tony Banks album)|Soundtracks]]'' albums, singing on the tracks "Shortcut to Somewhere", "Angel Face" and "Another Murder of a Day", co-writing the latter.

Fish appeared at World Bowl XI, 14 June 2003, Hampden Park, Glasgow. His performance included a rousing rendition of "Caledonia" before kick-off.

On 26 August 2007, Fish performed at the 'Hobble on The Cobbles' show at the Market Square in [[Aylesbury]]. He was accompanied on stage by his four former Marillion bandmates from the classic line-up ([[Mark Kelly (keyboardist)|Mark Kelly]], [[Steve Rothery]], [[Ian Mosley]] and [[Pete Trewavas]]) for one song: '[[Market Square Heroes]]'. This was the first time they had performed together in nearly two decades. In a press interview following the event, Fish denied this would lead to a full reunion, claiming that "Hogarth does a great job with the band&nbsp;... We forged different paths over the 19 years."<ref name="Singer Fish and Marillion Reunite">{{cite news |title=Singer Fish and Marillion Reunite |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6966603.stm |access-date=6 June 2008 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2007}}</ref>

His album ''[[13th Star]]'' was released on 12 September 2007 as a specially packaged pre-release version available to order from his website. A UK tour for this album commenced in March 2008, supported by [[Glyder (band)|Glyder]]. In February 2008, Fish was confirmed to be the Friday-night headline act at [[NEARFest]] X. He also appeared with [[BBC Radio 2]]'s [[Bob Harris (radio)|Bob Harris]] on [[GMTV]] to promote [[ChildLine Concert|Childline Rocks]], a charity concert.

In 2008, Fish presented a Friday evening radio show, ''Fish on Friday'', for digital radio station [[Planet Rock (radio station)|Planet Rock]]. When the station was faced with closure, Malcolm Bluemel (with the help of Fish, [[Tony Iommi]], [[Ian Anderson (musician)|Ian Anderson]] and [[Gary Moore]]) helped save Planet Rock by buying the station.<ref name="Planet Rock Saved">{{cite web|title=Fish – Planet Rock radio station saved |url=http://www.planetrock.co.uk/article.asp?id=731764 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330081715/http://www.planetrock.co.uk/article.asp?id=731764 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 March 2019 |access-date=6 June 2008 }}</ref>

On 9 June 2008, Fish embarked on his first full North American tour in eleven years. At each stop, he hosted a pre-show meet-and-greet with his fans. Two days prior, he was interviewed by Vince Font of the progressive rock podcast Prog'opolis, which was aired a week later on The Dividing Line Broadcast Network (DLBN) as "My Lunch With Fish".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thedividingline.com/archives.html |title=Podcast interview "My Lunch With Fish" June 7, 2008 |publisher=Thedividingline.com |access-date=20 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829062007/http://thedividingline.com/archives.html |archive-date=29 August 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In 2005, Fish won a Celebrity Music edition of ''[[The Weakest Link]]'', beating Eggsy of [[Goldie Lookin Chain]] in the final round, sharing £18,750 with Eggsy's charity and his own.

On 20 and 21 October 2012, Fish hosted Fish Convention 2012 in [[Leamington Spa]]. He performed two acoustic sets and two electric sets, including material from his upcoming release, ''Feast of Consequences''. He also performed "Grendel", a fan-favourite Marillion B-side, twice.

In September 2020, Fish released ''Weltschmerz'', his final studio album. The album was supported by the singles 'Weltschmerz', 'Garden of Remembrance' and 'This Party's Over'. The album received positive reviews<ref>{{Cite web|title=Fish - Weltschmerz|url=https://www.albumoftheyear.org/album/264430-fish-weltschmerz.php|access-date=2021-09-09|website=Album of The Year|language=en-US}}</ref> and was very commercially successful, having sold over 60,000 copies to date.<ref name=":0" />

==Musical style==
Fish has sometimes been compared to [[Peter Gabriel]], original lead singer of [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] in the early 1970s, and his voice has even been described as "uncannily close".<ref>{{cite book |last=Borthwick |first=Stuart |title=Popular Music Genres: An Introduction |year=2004|publisher=Edinburgh University Press |isbn=978-0-7486-1745-6}} "Their vocalist Fish (Derek Dick) had a voice uncannily close to Peter Gabriel's"</ref> Music journalist [[David Hepworth]] described his voice as a "conflation of [[Roger Daltrey]] and [[Peter Gabriel]]".<ref name="Hepworth"/> Fish has acknowledged Gabriel's influence on him and some vocal similarities, but has rejected accusations from some critics during his career that he does not have a unique voice of his own.<ref name="prasad"/> [[Peter Hammill]] of [[Van der Graaf Generator]] was also a major influence on his songwriting and vocal delivery, which is especially notable on the first two Marillion albums.<ref name="Larkin"/>

==Record labels==
Following a legal dispute with [[EMI Records]] and an unsuccessful contract with [[Polydor]], Fish established the Dick Bros Record Company in [[Haddington, East Lothian|Haddington]] in 1993. The studio recorded ''In Amber'' by [[Dream Disciples]] (1994) and ''Man Dancin'' by [[Tam White]] in (1996). He released a number of "official [[bootleg recording|bootleg]]" albums to finance the company before selling it to [[Roadrunner Records]]. Another financially unsuccessful period followed before he re-established his own Chocolate Frog Records label in 2001. He signed with [[Snapper Music]] in 2005, but later returned to Chocolate Frog Records.

After having his own independent record company in the 1990s which charted a number of releases in the chart, Fish decided not to sign up to the [[Official Chart Company]] when he released ''Weltschmerz'', an album self-funded, marketed and distributed from his home in Scotland. As Fish did not partner with a record label as per chart rules and regulations, he missed out on a Top Ten chart placing when early sales revealed that he would have been number 2 on the UK midweek charts behind that week's chart topper, the independent band IDLES.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greatmusicstories.com/2020/09/21/fish-weltschmerz/|title=FISH – WELTSCHMERZ Album Review|website=Greatmusicstories.com|date=21 September 2020|access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/independent-albums-chart/20201002/131/|title=Official Independent Albums Chart Top 50 &#124; Official Charts Company|website=Officialcharts.com|access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://distortedsoundmag.com/album-review-weltschmerz-fish/|title=ALBUM REVIEW: Weltschmerz - Fish|website=Distortedsoundmag.com|date=24 September 2020|access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/news/fish-denied-no-2-chart-placing-for-weltschmerz|title=Fish denied No 2 chart placing for Weltschmerz|author=Jerry Ewing|date=29 September 2020|website=Prog Magazine|access-date=17 July 2021}}</ref>

==Awards==
In May 2008, Fish's Planet Rock show ''Fish on Friday'' won the Silver award in the Music Broadcaster of the Year category at the UK Sony Radio Academy Awards 2008.<ref name="Fish wins Silver in 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards">{{cite web |title=Fish wins Silver in 2008 Sony Radio Academy Awards |url=http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Music_Broadcaster_of_the_Year&year=2008 |access-date=6 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414000640/http://www.radioawards.org/winners/?category=The_Music_Broadcaster_of_the_Year&year=2008 |archive-date=14 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In June 2008, at the New York Festivals Radio Broadcasting Awards, he and [[Gary Moore]] jointly received the Gold World Medal in the Regularly Scheduled Music Programme category for their respective shows on Planet Rock.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkfestivals.com/res/pdf/2008WinnersBookletRB.pdf |title=Newyorkfestivals.com |access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref>

==Acting==
Fish was offered and accepted a part in the 1986 film ''[[Highlander (film)|Highlander]]'' (for which Marillion were also offered the soundtrack) but he eventually had to turn it down, owing to his tour commitments with the band.<ref>{{cite book |last=Wall |first=Mick |title=Appetite for Destruction: Legendary Encounters with Mick Wall|year=2010|publisher=Orion|isbn=978-1-4091-2169-5}}</ref> Fish first appeared on terrestrial television as himself in the "More Bad News" episode of the series ''[[The Comic Strip Presents...]]'' in 1988.

His first acting role was as a guest star in an episode of ''[[Zorro (1990 TV series)|Zorro]]'' called "The Newcomers" (aired 10 February 1991) but a more prominent role was as the thug Ferguson alongside [[John Sessions]] in ''Jute City'', a four-part 1991 BBC drama based on a group of [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] ruffians.

In 1994, he appeared in ''[[Chasing the Deer]]'', a film set during the [[1745 Jacobite rebellion]], as Angus Cameron. He also missed out on a role in ''[[Braveheart]]''. He spent two days with [[Mel Gibson]] in London who kept asking him to be involved but he was committed to touring his ''[[Suits (album)|Suits]]'' album instead.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.getreadytorock.com/rock_stars/fish.htm | title= Interview: FISH | publisher=Get Ready to Rock! | first=Jason | last=Ritchie | access-date=19 August 2015}}</ref>

In 1998, he appeared as David Lawson in series 14, episode 44 of the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] series ''[[The Bill]]'', titled "Manhunt" and was aired on 16 April.

He played Derek Trout, a record producer in the 1998 series, ''[[The Young Person's Guide To Becoming A Rock Star]]''.

He appeared as Barry Judd in a 2000 episode of the TV detective series ''[[Rebus (TV series)|Rebus]]'' alongside [[John Hannah (actor)|John Hannah]].

Later in 2000, Fish would go on to act this time in the popular Scottish detective television programme ''[[Taggart (series)|Taggart]]'' episode number 48, "Skin Deep".

In 2001, he auditioned (unsuccessfully) for the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Die Another Day]]''. He then went on to appear in two episodes of ''[[Snoddy]]'', a short-lived Scottish television sitcom.

In 2004, Fish played Finlay Price in the TV movie ''[[Quite Ugly One Morning]]'' alongside [[James Nesbitt]], [[Eddie Marsan]] and [[Annette Crosbie]].

Fish appeared as Old Nick, a [[camp (style)|camp]] [[homosexuality|homosexual]] in the 2002 crime comedy film ''[[9 Dead Gay Guys]]''.

In the 2005 film, ''[[The Jacket]]'', Fish appeared alongside [[Adrien Brody]] and [[Keira Knightley]] as a patient in a mental institution, Jimmy Fleischer, and he played Uncle Jimmy in the 2012 comedy drama ''Electric Man''.

==Personal life==
On 25 July 1987, Fish married his first wife, Tamara Nowy, a German model who appeared in the music videos for "[[Kayleigh]]", "[[Lady Nina]]", and "A Gentleman's Excuse Me". They divorced in 2003. The marriage produced one daughter, Tara Rowena (Taz), who was born on 1 January 1991. In 2012, she was nominated for Scottish Model of the Year, but she lost to Annie Lennox's daughter.

Following the divorce, Fish entered into a relationship with [[Mostly Autumn]] singer Heather Findlay.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/heather-a-good-catch-for-fish-1-993970|title=Heather a good catch for fish . .|publisher=Edinburgh Evening News|date=1 August 2006|access-date=21 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422232209/http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/heather-a-good-catch-for-fish-1-993970|archive-date=22 April 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

On 14 October 2017, he married his third wife, Simone Rosler, at Aberlady Church, East Lothian, Scotland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fishmusic.scot/news/article/mr-and-mrs-dick---just-married/1841|title=Mr and Mrs Dick - "Just Married"|date=2017-10-24|website=FISH|language=en-US|access-date=2021-02-17}}</ref>

In 2008, Fish stated that he would be taking at least six months off from singing due to an "irregular cell growth" in his throat.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gigwise.com/news/48358/Ex-Marillion-Singer-Fish-Quits-Music-After-Cancer-Scare|title=EX MARILLION SINGER FISH QUITS MUSIC AFTER CANCER SCARE|work=Gigwise|date=22 December 2008|access-date=23 June 2015}}</ref> It was later determined not to be cancerous.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/marillions-fish-feared-would-lose-1878788|title=Marillion's Fish feared he would lose voice|publisher=Wales Online|date=7 December 2010|access-date=23 June 2015}}</ref>

==Politics==
On politics, Fish said in 1993, "I've got a lot of [[socialism|socialist]] trends, but I work in a [[capitalism|capitalist]] industry. Getting involved in politics can be very dangerous. There are a lot of doors that can shut when you get involved in politics."<ref name="prasad"/> He is a supporter of [[Scottish independence]] because he is "dismayed" by the UK's [[Euroscepticism in the United Kingdom|anti-European]] stance and does not believe a "London-based government" is "beneficial to the UK as a whole". Fish argued that independence could "shake up British politics" to ensure a more "fair distribution of wealth" throughout the UK.
