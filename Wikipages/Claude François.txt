'''Claude Antoine Marie François''' ({{IPA-fr|klod ɑ̃twan maʁi  fʁɑ̃swa}}; 1 February 1939 – 11 March 1978), also known by the nickname '''Cloclo''', was a French pop singer, composer, songwriter, music producer, drummer and dancer. François co-wrote the lyrics of "[[Comme d'habitude]]" (composed by Jacques Revaux and himself), the original version of "[[My Way]]" and composed the music of "Parce que je t'aime mon enfant", the original version of "[[My Boy]]". Among his most famous songs are "Le Téléphone Pleure", "Le lundi au soleil", "Magnolias for Ever", "Alexandrie Alexandra" and "Cette année là".

François sold some 70 million records during his career (and after his death) and was about to embark for the United States when he was accidentally electrocuted in March 1978 at age 39.<ref>[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/movies/2012/04/-french-film-festival-city-of-lights-city-of-angels-kicks-off-monday.html French film festival City of Lights, City of Angels kicks off Monday], latimes.com, 3 February 2012.</ref> Former French President [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] is quoted as saying Claude François was, to him, "the French equivalent of [[The Beatles]], meaning the great talent of a generation".<ref>[http://www.theartsdesk.com/new-music/france-remembers-claude-fran%C3%A7ois France Remembers Claude François], TheArtsdesk.com, 13 February 2012</ref><ref>Pierre Pernez, ''Claude François en souvenirs'', City Editions, 2013 (French)</ref>

==Early life==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
The son of a French father and a [[Calabria]]n mother, Claude Antoine Marie François was born in [[Egypt]], in the city of [[Ismaïlia]], where his father, Aimé François (1908–1961), was working as a senior manager in the Anglo-French Suez canal company on the [[Suez Canal]]. In 1951, the job took the family to the city of [[Port Tewfik]] (now [[Suez Port]]). Claude had an older sister, Josette (born 1934), who wrote her memoirs in 2008.

François' mother, Lucia Mazzeï (1910–1992) was very musical and had her son take piano and violin lessons. On his own, the boy learned to play the drums. As a result of the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], the family returned to live in [[Monaco]], 
The family's expulsion from Egypt was traumatic. They struggled financially after François' father fell ill and could not work.  Claude found a job as a bank clerk and at night earned extra money playing drums with an orchestra at the luxury hotels along the [[French Riviera]]. With a good singing voice, he was offered a chance to sing at a hotel in the fashionable Mediterranean resort town of [[Juan-les-Pins]]. Claude's show was well-received and he began to perform at the glamorous [[Nightclub|night-clubs]] along the [[Côte d'Azur]].  While working in a club in 1959, he met [[Janet Woollacott]]; they wed in 1960.
Claude's father turned his back on his son when he became a musician in Monte Carlo in 1957.{{Why|date=June 2018}}

==Professional career and personal life==
[[File:Claude François (1976) by Erling Mandelmann.jpg|thumb|right|François on stage]]
François moved to Paris, where there were many more opportunities to pursue his career. At the time, American [[rock and roll]] was taking hold in France and he took a job as part of a singing group to make a living. With the goal of eventually making it as a solo act, he paid the cost to record a [[Gramophone record|45rpm]]. Trying to capitalise on the American dance craze "[[Twist (dance)|The Twist]]", he recorded a song titled "Nabout Twist" that proved a resounding failure. Undaunted, in 1962 he recorded a [[cover version]] in French of an [[The Everly Brothers|Everly Brothers]] song, "Made to Love", aka "Teen Teen Teen", under the name "Belle Belle Belle".

François' career continued to blossom under a new manager. In 1963 he followed the first success with another French adaptation of an American song, this time recording "[[If I Had a Hammer]]" and "[[Walk Right In]]" in French as "[[If I Had a Hammer|Si j'avais un marteau]]" and "[[Walk Right In|Marche Tout Droit]]". François met [[:fr:Michel Bourdais|Michel Bourdais]] who was working for the well-known French magazine ''[[Yé-yé|Salut les Copains]]'' ("Hi Buddies") and he asked him to draw his portrait.<ref name="richard1">[[Richard Anthony (singer)|Richard Anthony]], ''Quand on choisit la liberté…'', éditions Florent Massot, octobre 2010 (French)</ref>

On 5 April 1963,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.claudefrancois-lesite.fr/page.php?page=/bio/bio.htm|title=Claude François|publisher=www.ClaudeFrancois-LeSite.fr|access-date=22 October 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406232649/http://www.claudefrancois-lesite.fr/page.php?page=%2Fbio%2Fbio.htm|archive-date=6 April 2012}}</ref> he headlined at the [[Paris Olympia]], a sign that he had arrived. 
In 1964, he began a relationship with a 17-year-old [[Eurovision]]-winning singer, [[France Gall]], which lasted until 1967.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}
At the end of that year, François created original new dance steps, and [[:fr:Michel Bourdais|Michel Bourdais]] drew them. For the first time, they brought up the idea of setting up a show with female dancers.<ref name="richard1"/>

In 1967, he and [[Jacques Revaux]] wrote and composed a song in French called "[[Comme d'habitude]]" ("As Usual"), which became a hit in Francophone countries. Canadian singing star [[Paul Anka]] reworked it for the English-speaking public into the now legendary hit most famously sung by [[Frank Sinatra]] as "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". He sang the original version of "Parce que je t'aime, mon enfant" ("Because I Love You My Child") in 1971; it remained relatively little-known in France but [[Elvis Presley]] covered it under the title "[[My Boy]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Although François continued his successful formula of adapting English and American rock and roll hits for the French market, by the 1970s the market had changed and the disco craze that swept North America took root in France. This was no problem for the versatile François; he simply re-invented himself as the king of French disco, recording "La plus belle chose du monde", a French version of the [[Bee Gees]]' hit record, "[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

[[File:Claude François (1976) by Erling Mandelmann - 4.jpg|thumb|left|Claude François performing in 1976]]
Looking for new talent, he came across a singing family of two sisters and their cousins. These women became known as "[[Cocktail Chic|Les Flêchettes]]" (named after "Flèche", the production label he owned) and then "Les Clodettes". He produced a couple of albums for them before his death, and they went on to sing for some of the major stars in European music. He worked non-stop, touring across Europe, Africa and at major venues in [[Quebec]] in Canada.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

However, in 1971, his workload caught up with him when he collapsed on stage from exhaustion. After a brief period off, he returned to the recording studios, releasing several best-selling hits throughout the early 1970s. He expanded from owning his own record company to acquiring a celebrity magazine and a [[modelling agency]].{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

==Philanthropy==
Although driven to achieve financial success, in 1974 he organised a concert to raise funds for a charity for handicapped children, and the following year he participated in a Paris concert to raise funds for medical research.

==Personal life==
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}In March 1967 he was finally divorced from Janet Woollacott, who had left him in 1962. This failed marriage was one of the three big traumas that affected his whole life. The relationship with France Gall ended in July 1967. After this François had an affair with singer Annie Phillippe, who reportedly refused to marry him.

François soon got consolation when he arranged a date with model Isabelle Forêt, whom he had first met a few years before. Their relationship lasted from 1967 to 1972 and produced two sons, Claude Jr. in July 1968 and Marc in November 1969. He hid the existence of his second son for five years because he thought that being a father of two would destroy his boyish image as "a free man and seducer".

By 1972 he was single again, dating several well-known European stars. Finnish model Sofia Kiukkonen 1973–76 and American model Kathalyn (Kathleen) H. Jones-Mann 1976–78 were his most important relationships of this period. He also had an affair with his dresser Sylvie Mathurin from 1974 to 1978.

He continued to perform while overseeing his numerous business interests. In 1975, while in London, he narrowly escaped death when an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb exploded in the lobby of the Hilton hotel and two years later a fan tried to shoot him while he drove his car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/23127/lot/27|title=Bonhams : Mercedes-Benz 450 SEL 6.9 berline 1976|website=Bonhams.com}}</ref>

In 1977–78, more than 15 years after his first hit record, he was still topping the musical charts with multi-million sales from hits such as "Alexandrie Alexandra" (which was released on the day of his burial) and performing to large audiences.

===International career===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}
He performed an international career mostly in Belgium and Switzerland, but also in Italy, Spain, England and Canada. In 1976, his song "Le Telephone Pleure" ("Tears on the Telephone") reached No. 35  in the [[UK Singles Chart]].<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

==Death==
[[File:Graf van Cloclo.JPG|thumb|right|Claude François burial site in Dannemois, Essonne, south of Paris]]
After working in [[Switzerland]] on 9 and 10 March and recording a television special for the BBC on Saturday, 11 March 1978, François returned to his Paris apartment, 46 Boulevard Exelmans, to appear, the next day, on ''Les Rendez-vous du Dimanche'' with TV host [[Michel Drucker]]. While taking a bath, he noticed that the light fixture was not straight on the wall; he stood up, tried to straighten it and was electrocuted.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1978-03-12 |title=Leading French Popular Singer, Claude Francois, in Home Mishap |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/03/12/archives/leading-french-popular-singer-claude-francois-in-home-mishap.html |access-date=2020-12-01 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

His body was buried in the village of [[Dannemois]], in the [[Essonne]] department (about {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of Paris), near which Claude François owned a house where he spent his weekends.

==Legacy==
On 11 March 2000, the 22nd anniversary of his death, Place Claude-François in Paris was named in his memory; it is located right in front of the building where he died.

A biographical film called ''Cloclo'' (''[[My Way (2012 film)|My Way]]'' internationally) was released in March 2012 to coincide with the anniversary of his death. It runs two and a half hours long and stars [[Jérémie Renier]].

Claude François's sons, Claude Jr and Marc, have assumed the management of their father's artistic heritage over the years.

==Controversies==
A woman named Julie Bocquet maintains that François is her father.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.femmeactuelle.fr/actu/news-actu/la-fille-cachee-de-claude-francois-se-confie-pour-la-premier-47197?_gl=1*28vh6z*_ga*WFpLS0lySlZYX3ZFa1F4Q0hpcUthZE94dmJocE9JOV9vMk5BSEIwVlc3QnJ5WURVUTFzTUk3X0FmVkNqRUl1Ug |title=La fille cachée de Claude François se confie pour la première fois : Femme Actuelle Le MAG |website=Femmeactuelle.fr |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref> Fabienne, her mother, was 15 when she got pregnant.<ref>[https://www.sudinfo.be/id109859/article/2019-03-27/fabienne-la-mere-de-la-fille-cachee-de-claude-francois-brise-le-silence-lepoque] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> Others have recently come forward as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.femmeactuelle.fr/actu/news-actu/claude-francois-julie-bocquet-ne-serait-pas-sa-seule-enfant-47439 |title=Claude François: Julie Bocquet ne serait pas sa seule enfant cachée : Femme Actuelle Le MAG |website=Femmeactuelle.fr |access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>
