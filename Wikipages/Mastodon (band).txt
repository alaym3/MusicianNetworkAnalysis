==History==

===Formation, early years and ''Remission'' (2000–2003)===

Mastodon was formed on January 13, 2000,<ref>{{Cite web |author=Loudwire |title=Mastodon's Troy Sanders - Wikipedia: Fact or Fiction? |date=January 25, 2017 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogCm_RnAVV8&t=4m56s |website=YouTube}}</ref> after drummer [[Brann Dailor]] and guitarist [[Bill Kelliher]] moved to [[Atlanta]] from [[Victor, New York]], and met bassist/singer [[Troy Sanders]] and guitarist/singer [[Brent Hinds]] at a [[High on Fire]] show.<ref name="Relapse Records">{{cite web |url=http://shop.relapse.com/artist/artist.aspx?ArtistID=10063 |title=Mastodon - Official Relapse Records Band Page |website=Relapse Records |access-date=October 12, 2008}}</ref> They discovered they had a mutual appreciation of [[sludge metal]] bands [[Melvins]] and [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]], [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] legends [[Iron Maiden]], and 1970s [[hard rock]]ers [[Thin Lizzy]], and shortly thereafter formed Mastodon. In an interview in 2009, Kelliher revealed that the first time Hinds attended a practice with the band, he "showed up so wasted he couldn't play".

The band recorded a demo in 2000, which featured Eric Saner on vocals.<ref name="Relapse Records" /> Saner left the band for personal reasons after just a couple of months. After recording a four-song demo and a 7-inch picture disc through Reptilian Records, Mastodon landed a record deal with [[Relapse Records]] in 2001.<ref name="Relapse Records" /> Mastodon released the EP ''[[Lifesblood]]'' in 2001, and its first full-length album, ''[[Remission (Mastodon album)|Remission]]'', in 2002, with the singles "March of the Fire Ants"<ref name="Relapse Records" /> and "Crusher/Destroyer" (which was also featured on ''[[Tony Hawk's Underground]]''). On each of Mastodon's first three full-length albums, the last track was an instrumental composition with a title that related to the [[Joseph Merrick|Elephant Man]].

In a [[MusicRadar]] interview, guitarist Bill Kelliher confirmed the album is about an "[[out-of-body experience]]", and looks at the concepts of astral travel, [[wormhole]]s, [[Stephen Hawking]]'s theories and the spiritual realm. 
The album follows a [[quadriplegic]] who learns [[astral projection]]. On his journey he flies too close to the sun, burning his umbilical cord which connects him to his body, and flies into oblivion. At the same time in [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]], [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] and his cult were channeling spirits and brought the quadriplegic to their time. He explains his situation and foretells the assassination of Rasputin. Inevitably Rasputin is assassinated and Rasputin guides him back to his body.

==Characteristics==

===Musical style===
[[File:Ursynalia 2012, Mastodon 03.jpg|thumb|Brann Dailor's (pictured) fill-heavy drumming style is influenced by [[jazz]] and [[progressive rock]], characterized by complex, atypical rhythmic structures (including irregular stopping and starting). He also attributes his style to band practice as a teenager, claiming that practicing with the guitarist instead of the bassist influenced his style.]]

Bassist [[Troy Sanders]] stated about their musical style:

{{cquote|We don't consider ourselves a metal band. We recognize there is a lot of metal in us, but we also want to believe we have a lot of [[rock 'n' roll]] in us, and we have a lot of [[progressive rock]] in us, we have bits and pieces of [[thrash metal|thrash]] and [[punk rock|punk]], and [[psychedelic music|psychedelic]]-ness sprinkled throughout. A lot of times for me personally, just having the metal tag itself seems kind of limiting on us because we have such an appreciation for all styles of music and we like to incorporate bits and pieces of those into our songs. But we also recognize all the different subgenres and the millions of times people say, "Oh, what do they sound like?" and you say something, I understand that. But, it doesn't affect how we create anything at all.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://loudwire.com/mastodon-troy-sanders-new-album-once-more-round-the-sun/ |title=Mastodon's Troy Sanders Talks 'Once More 'Round the Sun' |website=Loudwire |date=2014-05-13 |access-date=2014-06-25}}</ref>}}

[[Scott Kelly (musician)|Scott Kelly]] of [[Neurosis (band)|Neurosis]] has appeared to perform guest vocals on a track on every Mastodon album excluding ''Remission'' and ''Hushed and Grim''.

Mastodon's musical style has evolved much from their earliest pre-''[[Remission (Mastodon album)|Remission]]'' releases to ''[[The Hunter (Mastodon album)|The Hunter]]''. Their early work is significantly heavier and more abrasive than their later work, primarily or exclusively using [[harsh vocals]], more distorted instruments, and more atypical song structures. The release of Mastodon's third studio album, ''[[Blood Mountain (album)|Blood Mountain]]'', which incorporates both clean and harsh vocals, marked a shift in the vocal styles used, with subsequent albums favouring clean vocals almost exclusively.

===Lyrical themes===
Over its first four albums, Mastodon had specific concepts in mind, specifically the classical elements of fire, water, earth, and [[Aether (classical element)|aether]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Khan-Anselmo |first=Alexandra |title=A chat with Mastodon |url=http://www.exberliner.com/articles/brann-dailor-of-mastodon/ |website=[[Exberliner]] |date=January 27, 2012 |access-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Stosuy |first=Brandon |title=Mastodon: The Hunter |url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/15880-the-hunter/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |access-date=July 19, 2016}}</ref> 

''[[Remission (Mastodon album)|Remission]]'' does not deal with a particular theme but it is loosely based on the theme of fire. Songs like "Crusher Destroyer", "Where Strides the Behemoth" and "Ol'e Nessie" deal with the theme of fictional creatures.

''[[Leviathan (Mastodon album)|Leviathan]]'' is about the novel ''[[Moby-Dick]]''. It centers around the main characters and their thoughts during the story.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://litreactor.com/columns/white-whale-holy-grail |title=White Whale, Holy Grail: Moby Dick and Mastodon's Leviathan |website=LitReactor |access-date=June 25, 2014}}</ref>

''[[Blood Mountain (album)|Blood Mountain]]'' is about a man who is searching for the "Crystal Skull", which is on top of the "Blood Mountain". According to bassist [[Troy Sanders]], "It's about climbing up a mountain and the different things that can happen to you when you're stranded on a mountain, in the woods, and you're lost. You're starving, hallucinating, running into strange creatures. You're being hunted. It's about that whole struggle."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.chartattack.com/news/41025/beware-of-the-cysquatch-on-new-mastodon-album |magazine=[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] |title=Beware Of The Cysquatch On New Mastodon Album |date=April 26, 2006 |access-date=August 7, 2009 |first=Eva |last=Lampert |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101005011540/http://www.chartattack.com/news/41025/beware-of-the-cysquatch-on-new-mastodon-album |archive-date=October 5, 2010}}</ref>

''[[Crack the Skye]]'' deals with many different themes. The title, as well as some lyrical content, is a tribute to Skye, the younger sister of drummer [[Brann Dailor]], who committed suicide at the age of fourteen. Themes touched on within the album include "dark magic(k), [[astral projection|astral travelling]] and the role of [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]] in the downfall of [[Russian Empire|Czarist Russia]]".<ref>{{cite web |last=Blackeney |first=Jerome |title=Review of Mastodon's 'Crack the Skye' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/h5mq |website=BBC Music |access-date=July 31, 2012}}</ref>

''[[The Hunter (Mastodon album)|The Hunter]]'' does not deal with an entire concept like their earlier work. The title is a tribute to Hinds' brother, Brad Hinds, who died of a heart attack on December 4, 2010 while hunting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mastodonrocks.com/biography |title=Biography |website=Mastodon Rocks |access-date=September 10, 2018

''[[Once More 'Round the Sun]]'', like its predecessor, is not a concept album. It features themes such as relationships, struggles and hardships. The album was based on the various events that took place in each band member's lives the year before the album release.<ref name="loudwire2014"/>

''[[Emperor of Sand]]'' mainly deals with the themes of death and survival and is about a desert wanderer faced with a death sentence. The lyrics were inspired by the friends and family members of the band who were diagnosed with cancer.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/inside-mastodons-dark-emotional-new-lp-w456143 |title=Inside Mastodon's Dark, Emotional New LP |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |first=Steve |last=Appleford |date=December 19, 2016 |access-date=April 29, 2017}}</ref>

''[[Hushed and Grim]]'' has to do with grief, guilt, and the afterlife. Mastodon pays tribute to the memory of longtime friend and manager Nick John with their first ever double-album and a surrounding death mythology. According to drummer and co-vocalist [[Brann Dailor]], in this mythology “When you die, your soul inhabits the heart of a living tree. You have to experience the seasons the way that a tree does through a whole calendar year. That’s the way you have to say goodbye to the natural world. And in that time, you reflect on the pillars of the life that you lived. You get to atone for things that you’ve done.”<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.kerrang.com/features/how-collective-grief-shaped-mastodons-most-grandiose-gut-wrenching-album-ever/ |title=How collective grief shaped Mastodon’s most grandiose, gut-wrenching album ever |magazine=[[Kerrang]] |first=Sam |last=Law |date=September 2021}}</ref>

==Visual art==

===Artwork===
[[File:Mastodon live 2006.jpg|thumb|240px|right|A Mastodon backdrop in 2006, showcasing an elaborate painting, using the ''Leviathan'' artwork by the painter Paul Romano]]
Artist Paul Romano was responsible for all of the band's album art and backdrops up to 2011. The artwork for the band's fifth studio album ''The Hunter'' was made by AJ Fosik, a woodcarver who was also responsible for the backdrop the band used live at the time. Oakland-based artist Skinner, who, in his own words, specializes in "psychedelic nightmare paintings", has taken the reins on ''Once More 'Round the Sun''. "It's going to be a work of art for sure. It's going to be very eye-opening", said bassist Troy Sanders before the album's release. "Very striking. It's from another dimension, and a lot of our music is geared toward that idea—taking you to another planet on songs. It's out there, and I think it's incredible."<ref name="pastemagazine1"/>

===Live presentation===
Following their first tours in the early 2000s, Mastodon have performed at many major festivals such as [[Download Festival|Download]], [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]], [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival|Coachella]], [[Bonnaroo]], [[Big Day Out]], [[Rock Werchter]], [[Pinkpop]], [[Metaltown]], [[Ottawa Bluesfest]], [[Sonisphere Festival|Sonisphere]] and [[Soundwave (Australian music festival)|Soundwave]]. When performing the band has traditionally had a fairly lo-fi visual presentation. However, during the band's "Crack The Skye Tour" (2009–2010), they used a large screen behind the drumkit showing a visual show.

==Legacy and reception==
The "sludge/stoner/alternative metal outfit" Mastodon, as labelled by [[AllMusic]], is "one of the preeminent metal acts of the early 21st century".<ref name="Allmusic Bio">{{Cite web |first=James Christopher |last=Monger |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/mastodon-mn0000382565/biography |title=Mastodon Biography |website=Allmusic}}</ref> The [[BBC]] stated about Mastodon: "They might be bonkers of lyric, full of fantasy mumbo jumbo, but the band is unashamedly committed to its complex-of-composition craft, and the results have frequently stunned ever since their 2002 debut, ''Remission''. They are the most ambitious, most fearless, most fun heavy metal band to have breached the [[mainstream]] since the genre oozed its way out of [[The Midlands]] in the 1970s."<ref name="BBC The Hunter">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/x2wx |title=Review of Mastodon - The Hunter |website=BBC Music |date=September 14, 2011 |access-date=September 24, 2011}}</ref> ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' has stated: "Mastodon are one of the all-time great [[hard rock]] groups."<ref name="AltPress The Hunter">{{cite web |last=Ferris |first=D.
