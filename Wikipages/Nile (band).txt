== History ==
===1990s===
Nile formed in Greenville, South Carolina in 1993 from a previous band called Morriah, in which founding member [[Karl Sanders]] performed in since the 1980s.<ref name="Metalship">{{cite web |date=February 12, 2013 |url=http://en.metalship.org/interviews/258-Nile |title=Interview with Karl Sanders of Nile |publisher=Metalship |access-date=March 1, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206214026/http://en.metalship.org/interviews/258-Nile |archive-date=December 6, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The name of this band was taken from the [[Nile river]].

The EP ''Ramses Bringer of War'' was released by Visceral Productions in 1997. The label was due to release the band's first full-length album ''[[Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka]]'', but went out of business later that year. However, [[Relapse Records]] was open to releasing it early on, giving Nile a wider distribution and a chance to tour with [[Incantation (band)|Incantation]] and [[Morbid Angel]].

===2000s===
The follow-up, ''[[Black Seeds of Vengeance]]'', was released in September 2000. Prior to the release, drummer Pete Hammoura left the band due to injuries sustained while touring with Catacomb. Derek Roddy stepped in as a session musician to perform on all of the tracks (except "To Dream of Ur"). Also, prior to the album, [[Dallas Toler-Wade]] joined as a second guitarist/vocalist. Chief Spires left the band a few months after the release of ''Black Seeds of Vengeance'', citing personal and professional differences. He was replaced by Jon Vesano. The band also found new drummer Tony Laureano.

In 2002, ''[[In Their Darkened Shrines]]'' was released. One reviewer noted that the album gave "death metal a cinematic, symphonic twist".<ref name="Music">{{cite book

The follow-up album ''[[Annihilation of the Wicked]]'' was released in 2005. Greek drummer [[George Kollias (drummer)|George Kollias]] stepped in to replace Laureano, who left before the recording sessions began. After recording the bass parts for the album, Jon Vesano also left the band. He was temporary replaced by Joe Payne on the following tour. Another [[Darren Doane]] directed video was shot for the song "Sacrifice Unto Sebek".

In May 2006, Nile signed a recording contract with [[Nuclear Blast]]. On February 26, 2007, Nile entered the studio and began recording their fifth full-length album entitled ''[[Ithyphallic (album)|Ithyphallic]]'', which was their first release with the label. Karl Sanders had confirmed a release date of June 29, 2007 via a posting on the band's message board, which was later pushed back to July 20, 2007. As a special bonus, Nuclear Blast gave several fans the opportunity to listen to the new album two weeks before its release if they could decipher a hieroglyphic message, to which "papyrus" was the answer. Upon the album's release, it sold 4,600 copies, which enabled Nile to get onto the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] for the first time, reaching No.&nbsp;162 on that chart.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nile-ithyphallic-enters-finnish-chart-at-no/ |title=Nile: 'Ithyphallic' Enters Finnish Chart At No. 13 |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=August 3, 2007 |access-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref>

On March 21, 2007, Nile was confirmed as a "Second Stage" act for [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 2007|Ozzfest 2007]]. A message from Karl Sanders via Nile's [[MySpace]] profile indicated that they were excited to finally bring true death metal to an Ozzfest audience. From March to April 2008, Nile went on a headlining tour in the United States with [[Suicide Silence]], [[The Faceless]], [[Unexpect]], and [[Warbringer]]. From September to October 2008, Nile set out on a European headlining tour with [[Grave (band)|Grave]], [[Omnium Gatherum]] and [[Severe Torture]]. In October 2008, the band planned to take their ''Ithyphallic'' tour to South Africa for a booking of three shows, but were canceled for unknown reasons.

In June 2009, Nile entered the recording studio to begin work on their sixth full-length album entitled ''[[Those Whom the Gods Detest]]''. The album was released on November 3, 2009 and was critically well-received, with one reviewer suggesting "pretty much the only thing standing in Nile's way at this point is the fact that we as listeners have become so accustomed to the band's excellence that another excellent album seems almost par for the course".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onemetal.com/2009/12/07/nile-those-whom-the-gods-detest/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114075318/http://www.onemetal.com/2009/12/07/nile-those-whom-the-gods-detest/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 14, 2010 |title=Album review |publisher=Onemetal.com |access-date=October 20, 2011 }}</ref>

===2010s===
On October 21, 2010, bassist Chris Lollis was confirmed as the new member for Nile, after four years of session work with the band. On December 6, 2011, Nile announced work in progress, and the completion of drum tracking, for their upcoming album in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/events/news_comments.php?news_id=15276 |title=New Album  |website=Metalstorm.net |access-date=December 21, 2011}}</ref>

On February 4, 2012, Karl Sanders announced on his Facebook page that they had a new bassist, Todd Ellis, who would contribute vocals to the new record.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/KarlSandersOfficial/posts/376465202379435|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729183950/http://www.facebook.com/KarlSandersOfficial/posts/376465202379435|url-status=dead|title=This Weekend is... &#124; Facebook|access-date=September 24, 2012|archive-date=July 29, 2012}}</ref> The next day, he explained on the band's official forum that he had lost contact with Chris Lollis during the writing and recording of the upcoming album, and after three months of silence from him they hired a replacement.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nilechat.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=22565&start=75#p629165 |title=NileChat • View topic - Drums are Done ! |publisher=Nilechat.net |access-date=September 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016152307/http://www.nilechat.net/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=1&t=22565&start=75#p629165 |archive-date=October 16, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The seventh album ''[[At the Gate of Sethu]]'' was released on June 29, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nile-at-the-gate-of-sethu-track-listing-unveiled/|title=NILE: 'At The Gate Of Sethu' Track Listing Unveiled|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>

On February 9, 2015, Todd Ellis left the band, citing "unforeseen circumstances beyond my control".<ref name="Todd Ellis Official">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/ToddEllisOfficial |title=Todd Ellis Official |publisher=Facebook |access-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref> Nile's eighth studio album ''[[What Should Not Be Unearthed]]'' was released on August 28, 2015.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nile-to-release-what-should-not-be-unearthed-album-in-august/ |title=Nile To Release 'What Should Not Be Unearthed' Album in August |website=Blabbermouth.net |date=May 26, 2015 |access-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref>

In the summer of 2016, the band took part in the Summer Slaughter tour. 

In October 2016 after the Slummer Slaughter tour, Dallas Toler-Wade left the band, prioritizing his duties with [[Narcotic Wasteland]], and was replaced by Enthean vocalist/guitarist Brian Kingsland. Nile made the announcement in February 2017, <ref>{{cite news|title=NILE Parts Ways With DALLAS TOLER-WADE, Announces Replacement|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nile-parts-ways-with-dallas-toler-wade-announces-replacement/|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=February 13, 2017}}</ref> In May 2017, the band entered the studio to begin work on their ninth album<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2017/05/15/news/nile-studio-new-album/|title=Nile in the Studio For New Album|website=Theprp.com|access-date=May 15, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/nile-taps-producer-erik-rutan-for-next-album/|title=NILE Taps Producer ERIK RUTAN For Next Album|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|access-date=July 6, 2017}}</ref> ''[[Vile Nilotic Rites]]'', which was released on November 1, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/nile-vile-nilotic-rites-album-long-shadows-of-dread-song/|author=Divita, Joe|title=Nile Unveil Ninth Album 'Vile Nilotic Rites' + Debut New Song|website=[[Loudwire]]|access-date= September 6, 2019}}</ref>

==Musical style and themes==
The majority of Nile's music is written by vocalist/guitarist [[Karl Sanders]]. It combines traditional and [[technical death metal]]. Nile's music is also characterized by its extreme complexity and speed – for which the band has received acknowledgement from many music fans and journalists – and its extremely "heavy" riffing, due to Nile's guitar and bass tunings, which are normally [[Dropped A tuning]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPfilfgVuSs |title=Karl Sanders Talks About Nile's Tunings |publisher=YouTube |date=January 6, 2011 |access-date=September 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.moshville.co.uk/interview/2015/08/interview-karl-sanders-of-nile/|title=Interview: Karl Sanders of Nile|publisher=Moshville Times|date=August 24, 2015|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref>

Much of the lyrical content is based on Sanders' interest in [[Egyptology]] (mainly inspired by [[Ancient Egypt|Ancient Egyptian]] and [[Near East|Near Eastern]] [[mysticism]], [[Ancient Egypt#Historical%20development|history]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], and [[Art of Ancient Egypt|ancient art]]) and other ancient Middle Eastern cultures, such as [[Mesopotamia]].<ref name="Metalship"/> Works of [[H.P. Lovecraft]] also seems to have an enduring influence upon the band's lyrical themes; the word "Nile" and the title of the band's first full-length album ("Amongst the Catacombs of Nephren-Ka") can both be found in the same sentence of Lovecraft's short story ''[[The Outsider (short story)|The Outsider]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://overgroundscene.wordpress.com/2009/01/26/hplovecraft-and-death-metal/|title=H.P.LOVECRAFT AND DEATH METAL (4TH UPDATE)|publisher=[[WordPress]]|access-date=January 26, 2009}}</ref> Extensive sleeve notes are included on all Nile's full-length releases from ''Black Seeds of Vengeance'' onwards, with the exception of ''[[Ithyphallic (album)|Ithyphallic]]'', explaining the inspiration or source for the lyrics of each song.
