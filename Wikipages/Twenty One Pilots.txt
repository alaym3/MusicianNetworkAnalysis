'''Twenty One Pilots''' (stylized in [[Letter case|all lowercase]] or as '''twenty øne piløts''') is an American musical duo from [[Columbus, Ohio]]. The band was formed in 2009 by lead vocalist [[Tyler Joseph]] along with Nick Thomas and Chris Salih, who both left in 2011. Since their departure, the line-up has consisted of Joseph and drummer [[Josh Dun]]. The duo is best known for their singles "[[Stressed Out]]", "[[Ride (Twenty One Pilots song)|Ride]]", and "[[Heathens (song)|Heathens]]". The group received a [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] at the [[59th Annual Grammy Awards]] for "Stressed Out". The band independently released two albums, ''[[Twenty One Pilots (album)|Twenty One Pilots]]'' (2009) and ''Regional at Best'' (2011), before being signed by record label [[Fueled by Ramen]] in 2012. Their label debut, ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'', was released in 2013 and became the second album in history on which every track received at least a gold certification, making Twenty One Pilots the first band in the history of music to see every song on two albums earn gold or platinum awards.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Twenty One Pilots Are The First Band To See Every Song On Two Albums Earn Gold Or Platinum Awards|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2019/07/18/twenty-one-pilots-are-the-first-band-to-see-every-song-on-two-albums-earn-gold-or-platinum-awards/?sh=f41c0735953d|website=Forbes|publication-date=2019}}</ref> 

The duo achieved breakthrough success with their fourth album, ''[[Blurryface]]'' (2015), which produced the successful singles "Stressed Out" and "Ride" and became the first album on which every track received at least a [[RIAA certification|gold certification]] from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8223671/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-every-song-riaa-gold|title=Twenty One Pilots' 'Blurryface' Becomes First Album With Every Song RIAA-Certified Gold|last=Payne|first=Chris|date=March 1, 2018|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-date=November 20, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120212125/https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8223671/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-every-song-riaa-gold/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.riaa.com/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-earns-unrivaled-gold-platinum-achievement-first-album-digital-era-every-song-riaa-certified/|title=Twenty One Pilots' 'Blurryface' Earns Unrivaled Gold & Platinum Achievement: First Album In Digital Era With Every Song RIAA Certified|date=March 1, 2018|work=[[Recording Industry Association of America]]|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-date=December 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201228140854/https://www.riaa.com/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-earns-unrivaled-gold-platinum-achievement-first-album-digital-era-every-song-riaa-certified/|url-status=live}}</ref> The release of the single "Heathens" also made the group the first alternative artist in history to have two concurrent top five singles in the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and the third rock act in history to have two singles simultaneously chart in the top five of the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, joining [[the Beatles]] and [[Elvis Presley]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=McIntyre|first=Hugh|date=August 31, 2016|title=Twenty One Pilots Match A Charting Feat That Only The Beatles And Elvis Have Managed|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2016/08/31/twenty-one-pilots-match-a-charting-feat-that-only-the-beatles-and-elvis-have-managed/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129021803/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2016/08/31/twenty-one-pilots-match-a-charting-feat-that-only-the-beatles-and-elvis-have-managed/|archive-date=November 29, 2020|access-date=May 25, 2020|website=Forbes}}</ref>

Joseph began playing music after finding an old keyboard inside his closet, a Christmas gift he received from his mother, and began mimicking radio melodies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbusalive.com/content/blogs/sensory-overload/2012/04/interview-twenty-one-pilots-part-1.html|title=Interview: Twenty One Pilots, part 1|work=Columbus Alive|date=April 27, 2012|access-date=June 26, 2014|archive-date=July 14, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190259/http://www.columbusalive.com/content/blogs/sensory-overload/2012/04/interview-twenty-one-pilots-part-1.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Messiah">{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61WpOTdThzY |title=MessiahPulse Interview: Twenty One Pilots |via=YouTube |access-date=June 27, 2014 |archive-date=June 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200608074736/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61WpOTdThzY |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2007, Joseph recorded a solo album, ''[[List of songs recorded by Twenty One Pilots#Songs recorded by Tyler Joseph as a solo-artist|No Phun Intended]]'', in his parent's basement. Thomas contributed guitar to several songs on the album,<ref name="Episode 10 - Nick Thomas"/> and collaborated with Joseph on the track "Trees", which would later become a signature Twenty One Pilots song.<ref name="medium.com">{{cite web |url=https://medium.com/jeffersonian/20-facts-on-twenty-one-pilots-vessel-7243676c5c56 |title=20 Facts on twenty one pilots' 'Vessel' |work=Medium.com |date=November 16, 2016 |access-date=February 10, 2018 |archive-date=October 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201020055055/https://medium.com/jeffersonian/20-facts-on-twenty-one-pilots-vessel-7243676c5c56 |url-status=live }}</ref>

While attending [[Ohio State University]], Joseph met [[Texas]]-born future bandmate Chris Salih at a party. Noting the songwriter's talent and creative energy, Salih consulted Joseph about starting a band. Impressed by the recording studio Salih had built in his house, Joseph agreed to play music together and began sharing his ideas for new music. Just before their first performance, Joseph invited Thomas to join the unnamed band as a bassist. In 2009, the group moved into a house of their own, where their first album was conceptualized and recorded in the basement.<ref name="altpress.com">{{cite web|title=Founding Twenty One Pilots member Chris Salih opens up about band|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/twenty_one_pilots_chris_salih_interview_stream|website=altpress.com; Chris Salih interview|date=August 24, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|archive-date=April 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429070240/https://www.altpress.com/news/entry/twenty_one_pilots_chris_salih_interview_stream|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Episode 10 - Nick Thomas"/>

The band initially played for a wide variety of audiences at clubs and venues around the Columbus area. Playing at metal, hardcore, and electronic venues influenced Joseph to incorporate these disparate styles into his songwriting. To catch the attention of unfamiliar or disinterested attendees and promoters, the band began to experiment with costumes and on-stage [[acrobatics]].<ref name="altpress.com"/>

In 2010, the band posted two tracks to their [[SoundCloud]] account, a cover of "[[Jar of Hearts]]" by [[Christina Perri]] and a remixed interpretation of "[[Con te partirò]] (Time to Say Goodbye)" by [[Andrea Bocelli]] and [[Sarah Brightman]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://soundcloud.com/twentonepilots|title=twentonepilots|work=SoundCloud|access-date=November 5, 2015|archive-date=August 5, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160805212002/https://soundcloud.com/twentonepilots|url-status=live}}</ref> The latter track would become the first song that local drummer [[Josh Dun]] heard from the group.<ref name= "columbusalive.com">{{cite web| title= Interview with Twenty One Pilots' Tyler Joseph and Josh Dun, part 1| url= http://www.columbusalive.com/content/blogs/sensory-overload/2012/04/interview-twenty-one-pilots-part-1.html| website= ColumbusAlive.com| access-date= June 26, 2014| archive-date= July 14, 2014| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140714190259/http://www.columbusalive.com/content/blogs/sensory-overload/2012/04/interview-twenty-one-pilots-part-1.html| url-status= live}}</ref>

In November 2011, after months of cultivating a fan base in the Columbus area via social media interaction and constant touring, the band played a sold-out concert at Columbus' [[Newport Music Hall]].

Tyler Joseph successfully negotiated to maintain ownership of the preceding self-titled album, which remains available digitally.

Alongside their mixture of musical styles, the band melds relatable rhymes with [[angst]]y lyrics.<ref name="musicfeeds" /> Lyrically, Twenty One Pilots is conventionally post-emo.<ref name="Wilson"/> They coincide with a contemporary wave of [[emo revival]] fueled in part by [[Millennials|millennial]] [[nostalgia]] for popular music from the [[2000s in music|early 2000s]].<ref name="Wilson"/> Joseph's [[Confessional poetry|confessional]] lines convey personal turmoils and deeply rooted insecurities.<ref name="musicfeeds"/> Their songs contain moments where personal despair connect to a universal context, often relating to that of faith, location or community. Thus making the band more accessible than other more insular [[emo]]-inspired artists.<ref name="Wilson"/> Having been raised in Christian households, the lyrics of their songs rarely engage in profanity and [[shock value]]. The duo still identify as Christians, and a significant portion of their fanbase interpret lyrics from their songs as an ongoing negotiation with [[God]]. From a more secular perspective, their words center on [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], with habitual direct reference to self-harm.<ref name="Wilson"/>

The lyrical themes most prevalent on the band's major-label debut album ''[[Vessel (Twenty One Pilots album)|Vessel]]'' were introspection and fear.<ref name="Booth"/> Joseph wrote from a very introspective perspective, offering an inside view of what he was going through at the time. He feels that music is a catalyst to getting your emotions going. While he acknowledges many who write songs about [[love]] do so because its widely believed love is the most powerful emotion there is, he disagrees with the sentiment. Joseph instead thinks the emotion of [[fear]] is equally as powerful, if not slightly more so. As a result, much of ''Vessel'' pertained to the power of fear as well as dealing with and trying to find hope, peace and redemption at the end of and inside of fear.<ref name="Booth"/> Their next studio album, ''Blurryface'' was much like a [[concept album]] in that it was shaped by intimate themes regarding personal issues such as insecurity.<ref name="musicfeeds"/> Due primarily to the [[childhood]] yearnings of their breakout single "[[Stressed Out]]", Twenty One Pilots have become emblematic of angst-ridden millennial entitlement.<ref name="Wilson"/> The loose concept album is about Joseph attempting to defeat the [[alter ego]] of the titular monster-image representing his insecurities and self-hatreds.<ref name="Wilson"/>

The band's name was originally stylized as "twenty | one | pilots" on their earlier cover art; however, by the time of their second album, ''Regional at Best'', the formatting was changed to "twenty øne piløts" with a [[Ø (disambiguation)|diagonal line through the Os]].

Former Twenty One Pilots member Chris Salih stated in an interview that Mark C. Eshleman, a longtime friend of and creative director for Twenty One Pilots, created the band's logo by "messing around with shapes". Joseph found that the arrangement resonated with him.<ref name="Episode 09 - Chris Salih">{{cite web|title=Episode 09 - Chris Salih|url=https://soundcloud.com/21pilotspodcast|website=The Twenty One Pilots Podcast on SoundCloud|access-date=January 19, 2018|archive-date=October 31, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031232857/https://soundcloud.com/21pilotspodcast|url-status=live}}</ref> Regarding their logo, Joseph stated in an interview that:
{{cquote|It means Twenty One Pilots, the logo does. Why it means Twenty One Pilots, is it really goes along with one of our songs called "Kitchen Sink". The whole concept of that song is that I feel that humans are always struggling all the time when it comes to purpose, trying to figure out what their purpose is, what purpose even is, what's the point, justifying your own existence. A lot of kids and people my age struggle with "what's the point", and with the logo, what it really means is it's an encouragement. When someone asks me what the logo means to me, the logo means something to me because I made it mean something to me. That's the point. The point is that I created something that only I understand and whether or not I decide to disclose the meaning of it, that's the beginning of purpose for me. The meaning of purpose for me, is by creating something, if it be by writing lyrics, painting a picture, by expressing yourself through art if it's photography or music or theater, or whatever it is. It doesn't have to be artistic, but if you create something and only you know the meaning of it, that's the beginning of purpose for you. When you're in the room by yourself trying to decide whether to stay alive, you can tell yourself "I should probably stay alive because I'm the only one who knows the meaning of that thing", so the logo is an encouragement for people to create. That's what it means.<ref name="T|O|P symbol meaning">{{cite web |title= Get to know our locals: Twenty One Pilots |date= 7 March 2012 |first= John |last= Medina |work= Sound Scene Press |url= http://soundscenepress.com/?p=3792 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120522150836/http://soundscenepress.com/?p=3792 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 22 May 2012 }}</ref>}}

In 2018, a new logo was unveiled for ''Trench''{{'}}s release. An extra slash on each side was added to the previous logo. The color scheme was changed to yellow for the shapes with a solid black background, thus coordinating with the color scheme for the album's cover art. Joseph explained that, "If you were to look at those two logos that we had done in the past, and put it together, it would create a logo that is two upward slashes and two sideways slashes.

Twenty One Pilots became a local favorite in their hometown of [[Columbus, Ohio]] thanks to their energetic live concerts.<ref name="Lopez"/> According to Dun, "We played [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] shows, hip hop shows, no one knew where to put us. But we've approached live shows as a way to build something from nothing."<ref name="Lopez"/> The duo usually perform with pre-recorded keyboard tracks and programmed beats rather than a full band.<ref name="Wilson"/> However, Dun also plays a live drum kit while triggering the pre-recorded backing tracks.<ref name="BigNew"/> A former skater, he often breaks his performance up by using acrobatics, such as [[Flip (acrobatic)|backflips]].<ref name="Wilson"/><ref name="BigNew"/> Meanwhile, Tyler Joseph wears masks and occasionally body makeup while rapping and singing.<ref name="Wilson"/> He plays multiple instruments while live wearing a [[balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]].<ref name="BigNew"/> During their early shows, Joseph would wear a floral [[kimono]] onstage. Dun stated, "We thought it was kind of cool, new and different to wear masks onstage, but yeah, people were confused."<ref name="Lopez"/>
