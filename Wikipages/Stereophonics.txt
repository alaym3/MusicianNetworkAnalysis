==History==

=== Formation and early years (1986–1991) ===
[[Kelly Jones]] and [[Stuart Cable]] lived on the same street<ref name="Marks 24">Marks (2009), p. 24</ref> in the Welsh village of Cwmaman.<ref>Marks (2009), p. 4</ref> Jones heard Cable played drums so asked if he wanted to jam together.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 22–23</ref> After some time practising in Jones' dad's garage, Nicholas Geake joined in on guitar. Later,{{efn |name=dac |Exact dates aren't given in ''Demons and Cocktails''.}} Jones invited Paul Rosser and Chris Davies to play on bass guitar and keyboards, respectively.<ref name="Marks 23">Marks (2009), p. 23</ref> Cable recalls he was the one who suggested that Jones be the singer, as his dad was a singer back in the sixties who supported [[Roy Orbison]].<ref name="Marks 23"/> In 1986 the band recorded a demo under the name "Zephyr". When Jones went on holiday the band played a gig without him, which resulted in Jones leaving the band and Jones and Cable going their separate ways.<ref name="Marks 24"/> Jones, Rosser and Davies formed their own R&B band called "Silent Runner" while Cable joined a glam-rock band named "King Catwalk" on drums.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 24–25</ref>

A few years later,{{efn |name=dac}} Cable got sacked from the band and after a few weeks after that when on a bus, he waved to Jones who was standing at a bus stop and waved back.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 25–26</ref> It was the first contact they had since Zephyr had broken up. Two weeks later, Jones and Cable started speaking again in the Ivy Bush.<ref name="Marks 26">Marks (2009), p. 26</ref> They agreed to give the band another go but Cable only wanted to play their own songs, to which Jones agreed.<ref name="Marks 26"/> The duo invited Mark Everett to play for them on bass guitar and Jones then started writing his own songs.<ref name="Marks 27">Marks (2009), p. 27</ref>

Everett went on holiday for two weeks but Jones and Cable wanted to continue rehearsing, so Jones invited long-time friend [[Richard Jones (Stereophonics)|Richard Jones]] to fill in for Everett.<ref name="Marks 27"/> Stunned by Richard's appearance and bass playing, Cable convinced Kelly to keep him instead of Everett.<ref name="Marks 27"/> The band decided they needed another member to play lead guitar. Simon Collier was the first guitarist brought in, but didn't stay in the band; he did, however, become Kelly's guitar technician.<ref>Marks (2009), p. 32</ref> The band tried hiring two other guitarists, another Richard Jones and Glenn Hyde.<ref name="Marks 33">Marks (2009), p. 33</ref> Neither stayed for long. Hyde did however play harmonica on "Rooftop" for the band's 2001 album ''[[Just Enough Education to Perform]]''.<ref name="Marks 33"/> After Hyde left, the band stuck as a three-piece act.<ref name="Marks 33"/>

=== Name change and V2 Records (1992–1996) ===
Kelly, Richard and Cable began writing and performing music in working men's clubs together in 1992 {{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} as a band known as "Tragic Love Company", a name inspired by their favourite bands ([[the Tragically Hip]], [[Mother Love Bone]] and [[Bad Company]]).<ref>Marks (2009), p. 29</ref> After Tragic Love Company supported Smalltown Heroes in the Borderline Club, London, they met Marshall Bird and Steve Bush who were interested in producing for the band. The band agreed and recorded a demo for "[[A Thousand Trees]]".<ref>Marks (2009), p. 38</ref>

Wayne Coleman organised a series of concerts throughout South Wales after receiving a demo from the band. Wayne liked it a lot but hated the band name and told them they wouldn't be performing unless they changed it.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 37–38</ref> After Cable read the manufacturer name of a gramophone, "Falcon Stereophonic", he told Kelly and the band agreed to change their name to "the  Stereophonics".<ref name="Marks 40">Marks (2009), p. 40</ref> In March 1996,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} the band played a gig at their local [[Coliseum Theatre (Aberdare)|Coliseum Theatre]], Aberdare with [[Catatonia (band)|Catatonia]] and the Pocket Devils.<ref name="Marks 40"/> When the band finished their slot, John Brand approached them and he became their manager.<ref>Marks (2009), pp. 41–42</ref> Brand managed to get over 35 record companies in the UK interested in signing the Stereophonics.<ref>Marks (2009), p. 43</ref> In May 1996,{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} they signed with [[V2 Records|V2]],<ref>Marks (2009), p. 47</ref> the first artists to be signed to newly formed record label. Upon signing, they dropped "the" from their name and simply became "Stereophonics".

=== Debut album and ascent to fame (1997–2000) ===
In August 1997, the band released their first studio album, ''[[Word Gets Around]]'', which reached number six in the UK charts, from which five singles were released. The debut single, released 25 November 1996, was "Looks Like Chaplin".<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&pg=PA1011|page=1011|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|editor=Peter Buckley|publisher=Rough Guides|year= 2003|isbn=9781843531050}}</ref> Afterwards, the band embarked on a successful world tour.

In February 1998, the band received a [[BRIT Awards|BRIT Award]] for Best New Group. In the same week, the band re-released the single "[[Local Boy in the Photograph]]", which in turn reached number fourteen in the [[UK Singles Chart]]. The band's debut album, ''Word Gets Around'', also went [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] in the UK.<ref name="Inc 1999">{{cite book|author=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|title=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mAgEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA12|date=7 August 1999|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=12–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

In November 1998, "[[The Bartender and the Thief]]" (the first single from the album ''[[Performance and Cocktails]]'') was released, eventually reaching number three on the UK charts. "[[Just Looking (song)|Just Looking]]" was released next and reached number four in March 1999. In that same month, the album was released, entering at number one and going platinum within three weeks. Later that year, the band played in front of 50,000 people at [[Morfa Stadium]] in [[Swansea]]. The concert was filmed and released on DVD the following year. They also collaborated with [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] on a cover of the [[Randy Newman]] song "[[Mama Told Me Not To Come]]", for the Tom Jones album ''[[Reload (Tom Jones album)|Reload]]''.

Throughout 1998 and 1999, the band toured in Europe, Australia and the US. On 12 June 1998, Stereophonics played to over 10,000 spectators in the grounds of [[Cardiff Castle]] in Wales. Footage of the concert was released on VHS and DVD, titled ''[[Live at Cardiff Castle]]''.

=== Mainstream success (2001–2004) ===
The band released their third album, ''[[Just Enough Education to Perform]]'', in April 2001. The album included the track "[[Mr. Writer]]", which includes lyrics that criticise a critic who the band believe gave them a negative review. The album also contained one of the band's most famous tracks, "[[Have a Nice Day (Stereophonics song)|Have a Nice Day]]", which reached number five in the UK charts. To promote the new album, ''Just Enough Education to Perform'', the Stereophonics played a two-day festival, which was called ''A Day at the Races''. This event was held in [[Donington Park]] on the first day and at Cardiff's [[Millennium Stadium]] on the second. The concerts were supported by [[Ash (band)|Ash]], [[Black Crowes]] and [[the Crocketts]], with [[Proud Mary]] playing Donington only. Over 200,000 separate tickets were sold for the weekend festival. The performance was released on a DVD in 2002.

2003 saw the release of their fourth album, titled ''[[You Gotta Go There to Come Back]]''. In September 2003, drummer [[Stuart Cable]] was sacked. According to reports, it was because of his lack of commitment to the band. Cable, at the time, presented a TV show called "Cable TV" and felt that the band would never improve. Because of this, he missed several rehearsals and live concerts. He was eventually replaced by [[Javier Weyler]].<ref name="BBCStuartSacking">''[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3138970.stm Stereophonics drummer fired] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20110816053511/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3138970.stm |date=16 August 2011 }}.'' ''BBC News.'' Retrieved on 17 July 2007.</ref> [[Steve Gorman]], from the Black Crowes, stood in for Cable during the band's live performances until Weyler was appointed. When asked about Cable leaving the band in a 2010 interview with ''[[Rip It Up (magazine)|Rip It Up]]'' magazine, Kelly Jones acknowledged the difficulty of the situation.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://ripitup.co.nz/contentitem/feature-interview-with-stereophonics-issue-333-february-march-2010/1081 |title=Interview with Stereophonics |issue=333 |date=February–March 2010 |journal=Rip It up |access-date=15 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117062009/http://ripitup.co.nz/contentitem/feature-interview-with-stereophonics-issue-333-february-march-2010/1081 |archive-date=17 January 2011  }}</ref>

Towards the end of the year, Stereophonics did a sold-out tour of the UK, ending with a Christmas show at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff, supported by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]] and [[Adam Masterson]]. The show was closed with a live version of "[[Merry Xmas Everybody]]", originally recorded by Slade. The group took a break after their 2003–2004 world tour, which included a set at the Manchester Move Festival in July 2004.

=== Drummer change and Stuart Cable's death (2005–2010) ===
[[File:Stereophonics hamburg 2007.jpg|thumb|right|Stereophonics performing in Hamburg, 13 September 2007]]
Their fifth studio album, ''[[Language. Sex. Violence. Other?]]'' was released in March 2005. It marked their first recording with new drummer Javier Weyler. The band achieved their first number one hit in the UK singles charts with the album's first single, "[[Dakota (song)|Dakota]]". The second single from the album was "Superman". However, that song did not repeat the success of "Dakota", peaking at number thirteen. After "Superman" came "Devil", featuring a controversial video and reaching number eleven in the charts. The album was nominated for a [[The Pop Factory|Pop Factory award]] at the end of the year, losing out to [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]]'s ''[[Pushing the Senses]]''.

On 2 July 2005, the group appeared at the [[Live 8]] concert in [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]], London, playing to their biggest audience yet. The band were also scheduled to support [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] for a number of dates across Europe, in early 2006, but pulled out due to family commitments. 2006 also saw the release of Stereophonics' first live album, ''[[Live from Dakota]]''. The album is a two-disc compilation, featuring twenty tracks spanning all five of the band's albums and capturing the best of their 2005 world tour. Rather than being a recording of a single show, the tour was recorded every night and the band picked out the best version of each song individually. The album also features a track titled "Jayne", later released as part of Kelly Jones' solo album, ''[[Only the Names Have Been Changed]]''.

''[[Pull the Pin]]'' was released in the UK on 15 October 2007, along with a download-only taster; "[[Bank Holiday Monday (song)|Bank Holiday Monday]]". The track was also available for free to people who pre-ordered tickets for the band's concerts in 2007. The album was written and recorded by November 2006 but held back for release until late 2007.<ref>[http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms:/out/music/video_interviews/stv__Music__Stereophonics_video_interv_20071129 Stereophonics: Friends in the North] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101090636/http://www.stv.tv/content/out/music/videointerviews/display.html?id=opencms%3A%2Fout%2Fmusic%2Fvideo_interviews%2Fstv__Music__Stereophonics_video_interv_20071129 |date=1 January 2008 }} video interview with stv.tv</ref> "[[It Means Nothing (song)|It Means Nothing]]" was the first single of the album, released in September before the LP was released a week later on 15 October. The album contains twelve songs and reached number one in the UK's official album chart. The next single, "My Friends", reached number thirty-two in the UK charts, their poorest chart performance since "More Life in a Tramps Vest" from their debut album.

On 20 May 2007, at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston, the band were joined on stage by [[Casino (band)|Casino]] frontman Adam Zindani. Zindani continued to tour with the band for the remainder of the ''Pull the Pin'' tour, playing lead guitar and backing vocals. He has been credited for writing and performing on two of the band's new tracks, "You're My Star" and "My Own Worst Enemy". On "You're My Star", he sings backing vocals and plays lead guitar, whereas on "My Own Worst Enemy" he only plays lead guitar. In November 2008, Stereophonics released their first greatest hits compilation, ''[[Decade in the Sun: Best of Stereophonics|Decade in the Sun]]''.

On 8 December 2009, the [[Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games]] announced the line up for performers for the nightly Victory Ceremonies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-spectator-guide/celebrations-and-ceremonies/ceremonies |title=Ceremonies : Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics |publisher=Vancouver2010.com |access-date=7 June 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409005026/http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-spectator-guide/celebrations-and-ceremonies/ceremonies/ |archive-date=9 April 2010  }}</ref> These ceremonies included 30 minutes of entertainment from the evening's host province/territory, 30 minutes of medal presentations, and a one-hour performance by a musical talent.

On 9 October 2007, a retrospective DVD was released in the United States, ''[[Rewind (video)|Rewind: The First 10 Years]]''. The DVD is a double disc with a runtime of nearly four hours. Much of this footage was recorded around the time that the ''You Gotta Go There to Come Back'' album was being recorded. This is because a similar band history DVD was listed for release shortly after that album but was never released, due to the departure of Stuart Cable. This explains Jones' hairstyle (circa 2003/2004) in the interview footage and the appearance of Stuart and the rest of the band freely talking about their togetherness and solidarity as the original three members. The original footage was updated by adding further footage to the end, bringing it up to date with the band's fifth album. Stuart does not appear on any of the extra footage. Availability coincides with the US re-release of the ''Language.Sex.Violence.Other?'' DVD, and the worldwide digital debut of their latest studio album, ''[[Pull the Pin]]''.

In 2007, Jones released a solo album, titled ''[[Only the Names Have Been Changed]]'', while recording the band's sixth studio album, ''Pull the Pin''. The album contains ten tracks (all named after women) and features minimal instrumentation. The album also includes the song "Jayne", a previously unreleased Stereophonics track featured on the live album ''[[Live from Dakota]]'' and the ''Rewind'' DVD.

Stereophonics also performed the original opening theme tune for the TV series ''[[Long Way Round]]''. The song's lyrics were slightly altered for the follow-up series, ''[[Long Way Down]] and [[Long Way Up]]''.
