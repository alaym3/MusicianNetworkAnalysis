=== ''The Prettiest Curse'' ===
The third Hinds studio album, ''[[The Prettiest Curse]]'', was released on 5 June 2020 on Mom + Pop Music. It was originally scheduled for 3 April 2020, but was delayed because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic|2019-20 coronavirus pandemic]]. It includes more diverse instrumentation than previous albums, as well as singing in Spanish.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Glynn|first=Paul|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51571485|title=The band who answered The Strokes' last-minute call|date=2020-02-21|work=BBC News|access-date=2020-02-27|language=en-GB}}</ref> In an interview with ''The Forty-Five'' the band explained their decision to change their management for this album: "We were under a lot of pressure from our team, part of our management. They started blaming us for venues not selling out. Everyone was frustrated and it made us really sad."<ref>{{cite web|last=Swift|first=Jacqui|date=2020-06-04|title=Hinds interview: "It's a fresh start and we've changed a lot"|url=https://thefortyfive.com/interviews/hinds-interview-the-prettiest-curse-2020/|access-date=2020-06-04|website=The Forty Five|language=en-GB}}</ref>  During the pandemic, Hinds recorded a video performance of two songs, "New For You" and "Come Back and Love Me". The video was recorded separately at each band members' home and edited together for release through [[Rolling Stone|''Rolling Stone''<nowiki/>'s]] website.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hinds-band-madrid-in-my-room-video-975149/|title='In My Room' With Hinds|last=Shaffer|first=Claire|date=2020-03-30|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>

In the recording sessions for ''The Prettiest Curse'', the band also recorded a cover of "[[Spanish Bombs]]" by [[The Clash]]. Explaining why they chose that song, the band said, "As Spaniards, we don’t usually get shout-outs in songs, like New York or London, so the Clash writing a song about our civil war made us feel honored." They released the song on 31 July 2020 and performed it on 21 August 2020 during a live stream 68th birthday tribute show to [[Joe Strummer]] called "A Song for Joe: Celebrating the Life of Joe Strummer".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.radio.com/music/rock/bruce-springsteen-and-tom-morello-lead-joe-strummer-tribute?fbclid=IwAR1PtU2AJgTg3bSDr04qGQhBusO6-DdcWK-FBpujolu3tx2BPTJ9nRg_3qo|title=Bruce Springsteen and Tom Morello Lead Joe Strummer Tribute Concert|website=radio.com|date= August 20, 2020|accessdate=August 20, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Exposito|first=Suzy|date=2020-07-31|title=Hear Hinds Take on the Clash's Punk Classic, 'Spanish Bombs'|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/hinds-cover-the-clash-spanish-bombs-1037867/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-08-22|magazine=Rolling Stone|language=en-US}}</ref>

Overall, Hinds are considered a [[garage rock]], [[garage pop]] and [[lo-fi]] band, and have been compared to a blend of rock bands such as [[Velvet Underground]], [[The Pastels]], and ''[[C86 (album)|C86]]''-like bands, contemporary garage rock and 1960s groups with a pop sound,<ref name="paullester"/><ref name="facebook.com"/><ref>{{cite news |author=Malcolm Jack |date=27 November 2014 |title=Deers Review – Great Songwriting with Punk Values |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/nov/27/the-deers-review-punk-is-not-yet-dead |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> although they have mentioned [[Black Lips]], [[Ty Segall]], The Parrots, [[The Strokes]], [[The Vaccines]], and [[Mac DeMarco]] as their main influences.<ref name="paullester"/><ref name="NME">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/hinds-aka-deers-interviewed-our-motto-is-our-shit-our-rules|title=Hinds (aka Deers) Interviewed: 'Our Motto Is 'Our Shit, Our Rules''e|website=Nme.com|accessdate=2016-01-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2015/01/22/what-do-we-expect-from-the-vaccines|title=What do we expect from The Vaccines?|work=DIY}}</ref>
