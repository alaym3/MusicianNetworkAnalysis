'''AnnaGrace''', formerly '''Ian Van Dahl''', was a Belgian [[progressive house]], [[electro house]], and [[deep house]] music project fronted by Belgian singer [[Annemie Coenen]] and produced by DJ and record producer [[Peter Luts]]. The project first achieved success in 2008 with the hit singles "[[You Make Me Feel (AnnaGrace song)|You Make Me Feel]]," "[[Let the Feelings Go]]," "[[Love Keeps Calling]]" and the 2010 debut AnnaGrace album ''[[Ready to Dare]].''<ref name="Discogs Profile AnnaGrace">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/1150540-AnnaGrace/?project=AnnaGrace|title=AnnaGrace Discogs Profile|publisher=Discogs|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref><ref name="AnnaGrace Allmusic Profile">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/annagrace-mn0001011383/biography|title=AnnaGrace Allmusic Profile|publisher=allmusic.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> Today, Coenen continues to tour worldwide as AnnaGrace and Ian Van Dahl performing her biggest [[house music|house]] and [[trance music|trance]] hits.<ref name="Jan Vis-Dutch Booking Agent Profile">{{cite web|url=http://www.janvis.com/artist/annagrace/|title=AnnaGrace Jan Vis Booking Agent Profile|publisher=janvis.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>

== History ==

=== 2000–2008: Ian van Dahl ===
The project’s first single was "Castles in the Sky", with lyrics written and vocals performed by Martine Theeuwen (a.k.a. Marsha). Without Theeuwen’s knowledge or consent, Cindy Mertens was hired to lip-synch to her vocals onstage. Since she was not allowed to perform the song herself, Theeuwen felt betrayed and left the project.<ref name="Martine Marsha Theeuwen official Website">{{cite web|url=http://www.marsha.be/aboutme1.html|title=Martine "Marsha" Theeuwen official Website|publisher=marsha.be|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref><ref name="Interview with Marsha (Castles in the Sky)">{{cite web|url=http://www.dancevibes.be/interviews/interview-marsha-castles-sky/|title=Interview with Marsha (Castles in the Sky)|publisher=dancevibes.be|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>

Subsequently they were both replaced, as Annemie Coenen was selected by executive producers Christophe Chantzis and Erik Vanspauwen to be the new front woman and singer of the Ian van Dahl project.<ref name="Ian Van Dhal itunes Profile Bio">{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/ian-van-dahl/id17769814|title=Ian Van Dhal itunes Profile Bio|publisher=itunes.apple.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> In the early stages of her involvement Coenen mimed the original vocals of Theeuwen when performing the project's debut hit "[[Castles in the Sky (song)|Castles in the Sky]]" onstage. A new version featuring Coenen's vocals was eventually recorded. She later became involved in the songwriting with the producers and recorded vocals for the follow-up singles ("[[Will I?]]," "Reason," "Try") and the debut album [[Ace (Ian Van Dahl album)|''Ace'']]. The single "Castles In The Sky" was already a major success, reaching No.3 on UK charts while also spending seven weeks in the top 10 in the summer of 2001. The single had also managed to crossover onto American Charts and reached the [[Billboard Hot 100]] where it peaked at No.91.<ref name="Ian Van Dahl-Castles In The Sky US Charts Billboard">{{cite web|url=http://www.song-database.com/chhist.php?sid=24910|title=Ian Van Dahl-Castles In The Sky US Charts Billboard|publisher=song-database.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> The follow-up singles recorded with Coenen became major hits on the [[UK singles chart]]s as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/ian%20van%20dahl|title=The Official Charts Company - Ace (Ian Van Dahl album)|date=10 July 2013|publisher=[[Official Charts Company]]}}</ref> The singles "[[Will I?]]" peaked at No.5,  "Reason" at No.8 and "Try" at No.15. The ''Ace'' album reached No.7 in the UK where it achieved Gold status.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/Ace|title=The Official Charts Company - Ace by Ian Van Dahl Search |date=11 July 2013|publisher=The Official Charts Company}}</ref>

In 2004, Coenen recorded vocals for the second Ian van Dahl album ''[[Lost & Found (Ian Van Dahl album)|Lost & Found]]''. Belgian producers Peter Luts and David Vervoort officially joined Chantizs and Vanspauwen for the production of the second album. The album singles "I Can't Let You Go," "Believe," "Where Are You Now?" and "Inspiration" were all successful, but failed to match the massive commercial sales of the previous singles from the first album. The final singles Coenen recorded with Ian van Dahl ("Movin On" and "Just a Girl") were released in the late-2000s.

===2008–2013: AnnaGrace===
After the breakup of Ian van Dahl, Coenen teamed up with Luts in 2008.<ref name="Ian Van Dahl Discogs Profile">{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/artist/12789-Ian-Van-Dahl|title=Ian Van Dahl Discogs Profile|publisher=discogs.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> The two decided to form their own project called AnnaGrace, they departed from their [[vocal trance]] roots of their pasted project, and started to produce [[progressive house]], [[electro house]], and [[deep house]] music. In June 2008, the debut AnnaGrace single, "[[You Make Me Feel (AnnaGrace song)|You Make Me Feel]]", was released in Belgium, shortly followed by a release in the U.S., where it reached No.1 on the Billboard [[Hot Dance Airplay]].<ref name="Hot dance Airplay Archieve October 25, 2008">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/archive/charts/2008/hot-dance-airplay|title=Hot dance Airplay Achieve October 25, 2008|publisher=billboard.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> The second AnnaGrace single, "[[Let the Feelings Go]]", was released in 2009. The single achieved success on charts in the Netherlands and Belgium while also reaching No.1 on the Billboard [[Hot Dance Airplay]] like its predecessor.<ref name="AnnaGrace Let Feelings Go Billboard Charts US">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XFZj6BL4zl8C&q=annagrace+let+the+feelings+go+Billboard+Aug+1%2C+2009&pg=PA3|title=AnnaGrace Let Feelings Go Billboard Charts US|date=August 2009|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref> "[[Love Keeps Calling]]", the third AnnaGrace single, achieved moderate success in Belgium and the Netherlands and peaked at No.47 on the Billboard [[Hot Dance Airplay]]<ref name="AnnaGrace-Love Keeps Calling Chart History">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/music/annagrace|title=AnnaGrace-Love Keeps Calling Chart History|publisher=billboard.com|access-date=2017-10-25}}</ref>  The fourth AnnaGrace single,  "Celebration", was released in Belgium in May 2010.
