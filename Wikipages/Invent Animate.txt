==History==

===Formation and ''Waves'' (2011-2013)===
Invent Animate formed in 2011 and immediately began working on their first EP ''Waves''. The six track EP was recorded at 456 Recordings with producer [[Brian Hood]], former drummer of [[Mychildren Mybride]]. The EP was heavily featured on many online blogs such as ItDjents, Chugcore, got-djent, The Daily Mosh, The Djentlemen's Club and more. The track "Captive" featured Brendon McMaster of now defunct [[deathcore]] band [[The Crimson Armada]]. Following the release of their EP the band was able to play a number of shows supporting bands such as [[Capsize (band)|Capsize]], [[Elitist (band)|Elitist]], [[Close to Home (band)|Close to Home]], and future label mates [[Erra (band)|ERRA]]. In late 2012 they released the single "Lightfinder", which featured Aaron Matts from [[Betraying the Martyrs]]. They released a couple of singles in 2013; "Wolf Skin" and "Half-Life"<ref>McConnel, Kristen.

===Arrival of Marcus Vik and ''Greyview'' (2019-2021)===

On 7 November 2019, the band would release the single ''[[Cloud Cascade]]'' and announce the new vocalist, [[Marcus Vik]], previously the vocalist of Swedish metalcore band [[Aviana]]. As of early January 2020, the band joined [[Silent Planet]], [[Greyhaven]] and [[Currents (Band)|Currents]] on the Trilogy tour. Just after the tour was announced, as of 11 January 2020, bassist Caleb Sherraden will not be joining the band on tour due to medical issues.

On January 24, 2020, the band released second single “Dark” and announced their album ‘’[[Greyview]],’’ which was released through [[Tragic Hero Records]] on March 13, 2020, and is the first album with Marcus Vik on vocals.

=== Departure from [[Tragic Hero Records]] to [[UNFD]] (2021-Present)===

On September 10, 2021, Invent Animate announced they had left [[Tragic Hero Records]] and has signed with [[UNFD]]. They also announced a new EP titled ''The Sun Sleeps As If It Never Was''.

On September 23, 2021, the band released the three track EP ''The Sun Sleeps, As If It Never Was''. The band also released a 10-minute long concept video for the EP. Drummer Trey Celeya spoke about the concept of the EP and video:  “Despite all attempts to keep our darker reality shadowed in secrecy, there comes a moment in time when the truth can no longer be hidden behind closed doors or empty excuses. And at once, everything is revealed, as if the light is a constant law of nature laying bare the secrets we believe are ours to keep. In this infinite moment, the bond shared between two loved ones is severed. The flow of time does not wash away the scars; it only immortalizes what is suspended in the balance — the pain of loss, the gift of hindsight, and the curse of hope. What will always be a memory. This EP is a true story of addiction and the trauma that lies in its aftermath of a secret too dark to be hidden.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://hmmagazine.com/invent-animate-releases-ep-the-sun-sleeps-as-it-if-never-was-unveils-double-feature-video/|title = Invent Animate releases EP, 'The Sun Sleeps, as It if Never Was,' unveils double feature video}}</ref>
