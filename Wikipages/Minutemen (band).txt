'''Minutemen''' were an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]], [[California]], in 1980. Composed of guitarist/vocalist [[D. Boon]], bassist/vocalist [[Mike Watt]], and drummer [[George Hurley]], Minutemen recorded four albums and eight [[extended play|EPs]] before Boon's death in an automobile accident in 1985; after Boon's death, the band broke up. They were noted in the [[California punk]] community for a philosophy of "jamming econo"—a sense of thriftiness reflected in their touring and presentation—while their eclectic and experimental attitude was instrumental in pioneering [[alternative rock]] and [[Post-hardcore|post-hardcore]].

==History==
===Formation===
Minutemen began when [[D. Boon]] and [[Mike Watt]] met at age 13. Watt was walking through a park in their hometown of [[San Pedro, California]] when Boon, playing a game of "army" with other boys, fell out of a tree right next to him and found that his friends, one named Eskimo, must have ditched him.<ref name="earpollution">{{cite web | author=Craig Young | title=Contemplating Mike Watt | url=http://www.earpollution.com/vol2/aug00/profiles/mikewatt/mikewatt2.html | publisher=Ear Pollution | access-date=2007-06-11}}</ref> Both boys shared a passion for music; Boon's mother taught D. to play the guitar and suggested Watt learn to play bass. At first, Watt did not know the difference between bass and standard guitars.<ref name="wattbio2005">{{cite web | author=Karen Schoemer | title=Watt Bio | url=http://www.hootpage.com/hoot_wattbio.html | publisher=Mike Watt's Hoot Page | access-date=2007-06-11}}</ref> The pair eventually started playing music together, mostly covering songs from artists they admired. In the summer of 1973 Watt and Boon formed the Bright Orange Band, with Boon's brother Joe on drums. In 1976 they discovered punk; Boon's mother died, and the Bright Orange Band disbanded shortly thereafter. The next year, the two joined a short-lived band called Starstruck.<ref name="wattdosbio">{{cite web|author=Mike Watt & Kira Roessler |title=Dos Bio |url=http://www.hootpage.com/hoot_dos.html#mike%20watt |publisher=Mike Watt's Hoot Page |access-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050924192158/http://hootpage.com/hoot_dos.html |archive-date=September 24, 2005 }}</ref> Following Starstruck's disbandment, Boon and Watt met drummer [[George Hurley]] and formed [[The Reactionaries (band)|The Reactionaries]] with vocalist [[Martin Tamburovich]].<ref name="wattdosbio"/>

After the Reactionaries disbanded, Boon and Watt formed Minutemen in January 1980. Watt has said their name had nothing at all to do with the brevity of their songs; rather, it was derived partly from the fabled [[Minutemen (militia)|minutemen militia]] of colonial times and partly to lampoon a [[right-wing]] [[reactionary]] group of the 1960s [[Minutemen (anti-Communist organization)|that went by that name]]. In the documentary ''[[We Jam Econo]]'', Watt also states that the name was a play on "minute" ({{IPAc-en|m|aɪ|ˈ|nj|uː|t}} {{respell|my|NEWT}}). After a month with no drummer, during which Boon and Watt wrote their first songs, the band rehearsed and played a couple of early gigs with local welder [[Frank Tonche]] on drums. The group had originally wanted George Hurley to join, but he had joined a hardcore punk band called Hey Taxi! with Michael Ely and Spider Taylor after the Reactionaries disbanded. Tonche quit the group, citing a dislike of the audience the band initially drew, and Hurley took over as drummer in June 1980. (Early rehearsal recordings with Tonche on drums later became the ''[[georgeless]]'' EP.) Their first live gig was as an opening band for [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Azerrad|first=Michael|title=Our Band Could Be Your Life|url=https://archive.org/details/ourbandcouldbeyo00mich|url-access=registration}}</ref>

===Early days===
[[Greg Ginn]] of Black Flag and [[SST Records]] produced Minutemen's first 7" [[EP (format)|EP]], ''[[Paranoid Time]]'', which solidified their eclectic style. Like most punk bands at the time, the band sold the EP at their shows and at a few local record stores. It became a minor hit with the [[hardcore punk|hardcore]] scene.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Calvert|first1=John|title=An Econo History Of The Minutemen|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/07698-minutemen-strange-world|website=The Quietus|access-date=August 30, 2015}}</ref>

They settled on their music style on their first LP, ''[[The Punch Line]]'' (1981), and toured constantly around America promoting the album. Their third EP and fourth overall release was ''[[Bean-Spill]]''. Their second LP, ''[[What Makes a Man Start Fires?]]'', gained attention from the alternative and underground press.{{fact|date=May 2018}} They continued touring extensively, which included a double bill with Black Flag in Europe. This tour strengthened their place as one of the most well-known acts in the hardcore scene.{{fact|date=May 2018}} In 1983 they released their third LP, ''[[Buzz or Howl Under the Influence of Heat]]''.

Minutemen's anti-[[rockist]] eclecticism was perhaps best exemplified on 1984's double album ''[[Double Nickels on the Dime]]''.{{OR|date=May 2018}} Though still somewhat obscure to mainstream audiences, ''Double Nickels'' has been cited as one of the more innovative and enduring albums of the 1980s American rock underground.{{fact|date=May 2018}} On ''Double Nickels'', they co-wrote some songs with other musicians, notably [[Henry Rollins]], [[Chuck Dukowski]], and [[Joe Baiza]]. In 1985 they released their most commercial-sounding recording, ''[[Project Mersh|Project: Mersh]]''. Though the album sounded more mainstream, it sold poorly compared to ''Double Nickels'' due largely to the negative reaction to such a commercial album from within the underground community.{{fact|date=May 2018}} They continued touring, and by the time of their final album, ''[[3-Way Tie (For Last)]]'', they decided to take a small break. They played their last tour with [[R.E.M. (band)|R.E.M.]]. Their final concert was in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] on December 13, 1985.<ref name="harp">{{cite web | author=Fred Mills | title=The Minutemen: Men At Work | url=http://harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=3394 | publisher=Harp Magazine | date=2005-09-10 | access-date=2007-06-11 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419003852/http://harpmagazine.com/articles/detail.cfm?article_id=3394 | archive-date=April 19, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===D. Boon's death===
On December 22, 1985, Boon was killed in a van accident, putting an end to Minutemen. Watt fell into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]] after his friend's death, but was convinced to continue performing by [[Sonic Youth]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Down The Highway: Mike Watt Interview|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uHrmJGEQwLU|publisher=[[YouTube]]|date=Apr 12, 2015|access-date=March 28, 2019}}</ref> In fact, the [[The Whitey Album|Ciccone Youth]] project was conceived in an effort to get Watt making music again.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Azerrad |first1=Michael |authorlink=Michael Azerrad |title=[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life : Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981-1991]] |date=July 2, 2002 |location=Boston |isbn=9780316787536 |pages=94 |edition=First Back Bay paperback}}</ref>

This put an end to the band's plans to record a half studio/half live triple album with the working title ''3 Dudes, 6 Sides, Half Studio, Half Live''. The live tracks were to be based on the ballots that they handed out and as a way to counteract [[bootleg recording|bootlegging]]. A year later, however, Watt and Hurley compiled various live recordings, based on the ballots, which were released as ''[[Ballot Result]]''.

In addition, [[Richard Meltzer]] had sent Watt lyrics for ten songs for an album on which he was going to collaborate. This project, eventually titled ''Spielgusher'', was completed (by Watt, Meltzer, Yuko Araki, and Hirotaka Shimizu) and released in January 2012 on [[clenchedwrench]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Watt|first=Mike|title=spielgusher|url=http://hootpage.com/hoot_spielgusher.html|work=Mike Watt's Hoot Page|publisher=Mike Watt|access-date=3 February 2012}}</ref>

===After disbanding===
{{see also|George Hurley|Mike Watt|Unknown Instructors}}
Following Boon's death, Watt and Hurley originally intended to quit music altogether. But encouraged by Minutemen fan [[Ed Crawford]], they formed [[Firehose (band)|Firehose]] in 1986 and have both formed solo projects since Minutemen disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Watt has created four acclaimed solo albums, recorded four with now-former-wife [[Kira Roessler]] as the duo [[Dos (band)|dos]], recorded three others as part of the [[punk jazz]] [[jam band]] [[Banyan (band)|Banyan]] with [[Stephen Perkins]] ([[Jane's Addiction]]), [[Nels Cline]] ([[Wilco]]), and [[Money Mark|Money Mark Nishita]] ([[Beastie Boys]]), contributed on "Providence" off [[Sonic Youth]]'s album ''[[Daydream Nation]]'' and "In the Kingdom No.&nbsp;19" and "Bubblegum" off ''[[Evol (Sonic Youth album)|EVOL]]'', toured briefly as a member of [[Porno for Pyros]] in 1996 and [[J Mascis and the Fog]] in 2000 and 2001, and became the bassist for [[The Stooges]] in 2003. He founded his own label, Clenchedwrench, in 2011, to release many of his own projects, including his fourth solo album ''[[Hyphenated-man]]''. George Hurley has produced work with Vida, [[Mayo Thompson]], and [[Red Crayola]], further indulging the free-form and off-the-wall leanings showcased on ''Double Nickels''. Hurley and Watt have also continued to make music together both live and in the studio since Firehose's splitting in 1994, starting with a track, along with [[Petra Haden]] and [[Stephen Perkins]], for the [[NORML]] benefit album ''[[Hempilation, Vol. 2: Free the Weed|Hempilation II]]'' in 1998. (See [[Minutemen (band)#Legacy|Legacy]] below for further Hurley/Watt projects.){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

====George Hurley and Mike Watt====
On rare occasions since 2001, and usually in the Los Angeles area (two December 2004 performances in England being a notable exception), George Hurley and Mike Watt, who have remained friends since Firehose's disbanding in 1994, reunite to play a set list of all Minutemen songs as a duet.<ref name="dustedatp">{{cite web|title=All Tomorrow's Parties - Minutemen Duet (Mike Watt and George Hurley)|url=http://www.dustedmagazine.com/features/176|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140717160755/http://www.dustedmagazine.com/features/176|archive-date=July 17, 2014|website=Dusted Magazine|access-date=August 31, 2015}}</ref>

They refuse to have a substitute guitarist play late Minutemen guitarist [[D. Boon]]'s parts; instead the songs are arranged for bass and drums. They insist that they not be billed as Minutemen for these shows or referred to as a Minutemen reunion,<ref name="dustedatp"/> as they do not want to cheapen or "vampire" the Minutemen name. Instead, they insist on being billed under their real names and that the advertisements state that they will be "playing Minutemen songs as a duet."{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} They were chosen by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] to perform one of these shows at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival that he curated in March 2012 in [[Minehead]], England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php |title=ATP curated by Jeff Mangum |publisher=Atpfestival.com |access-date=2011-09-15}}</ref>

==Musical style==
They were influenced heavily by bands such as [[Wire (band)|Wire]],<ref name="louderthanwar">{{cite web|last=Manchester|first=Guy|title=Mike Watt On… Brother Mike Shares Words of Wisdom About Punk, The Minutemen, The Stooges and much more…|url=https://louderthanwar.com/mike-watt-on-brother-mike-shares-words-of-wisdom-about-punk-the-minutemen-the-stooges-and-much-more/|publisher=[[Louder Than War (website)|Louder Than War]]|date=April 22, 2014|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> [[Gang of Four (band)|Gang Of Four]], [[The Pop Group]],<ref name="louderthanwar"/> [[Richard Hell & The Voidoids]], and [[The Urinals]], and nearly all of their early songs had unusual structures and were less than a minute long—even later, when Minutemen's music became slightly more conventional, their songs rarely passed the three-minute mark. Though Minutemen were members of the [[hardcore punk]] community and were somewhat influenced by the speed, brevity, and intensity of hardcore punk, they were known for hybridizing punk rock and hardcore with various forms of music (like [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[acid rock]], and [[rhythm and blues|R&B]]), separating them from most hardcore bands of that era. Minutemen were fans of [[Captain Beefheart]],<ref>{{cite web|last=McCall|first=Tris|title=Captain Beefheart dies at 69|url=https://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/2010/12/captain_beefheart_dies_at_69.html|publisher=[[NJ.com]]|date=December 17, 2010|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> and echoes of his distinctive, disjointed, avant-blues music can be heard in their songs, especially their early output. Through most of their career they ignored standard verse-chorus-verse song structures in favor of experimenting with musical dynamics, rhythm, and noise. Later in their career they blended in more traditional song elements they had initially avoided. They also played [[cover version]]s of [[classic rock]] songs by bands such as [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Marc|title=Double Nickels on the Dime|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22506-double-nickels-on-the-dime/|publisher=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=November 13, 2016|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> [[Steely Dan]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Metcalf|first=Stephen|title=The Rock Snob|url=https://slate.com/culture/2005/11/the-rock-snob-anatomized.html|publisher=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=November 4, 2005|access-date=March 18, 2019}}</ref> and [[Blue Öyster Cult]].<ref>{{cite journal|last ='Enthal | first =Andrea|title=Underground| journal =[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] | volume = 2 | issue =1 | pages = 47 |date=April 1986}}</ref>

Boon and Watt split songwriting fairly evenly (and Hurley made many contributions as well), though Watt rarely sang and Hurley even less so. Boon's songs were typically more direct and progressively political in nature, while Watt's were often abstract, self-referential "spiels." Lyrics and themes would thus often veer from surreal humor, as in "[[Bob Dylan]] Wrote Propaganda Songs" and "One Reporter's Opinion", to the frustrations of [[blue collar]] life in California, as in the enduring "[[This Ain't No Picnic]]". While many contemporaries rarely displayed a sense of humor, Minutemen were generally more light-hearted and whimsical. One example of this can be found in the title of their album ''Double Nickels on the Dime'', which poked fun at [[Sammy Hagar]]'s "[[I Can't Drive 55]]" by implying that the Minutemen preferred to take risks with their music rather than behind the wheel of a car.<ref name="watt_so">{{cite web|author=Sound Opinions|publisher=PRX|title=Sound Opinions May 25, 2011|url=http://www.soundopinions.org/shownotes/2011/052711/shownotes.html|date=2011-05-25|access-date=2011-09-01}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Many of the band's peers credit Minutemen. [[Dave Alvin]] of [[The Blasters]] called Minutemen "one of the finest combos to ever step on to a beer soaked stage".<ref>{{cite web|last=Alvin|first=Dave|author-link=Dave Alvin|title=fIREHOSE - Song for Dave Alvin|url=https://www.facebook.com/davealvinofficial/posts/mike-watt-is-an-immeasurably-talented-musicianpoet-a-constant-leading-figure-in-/10152841520863146/|publisher=[[Facebook]]|date=April 29, 2014 |access-date=March 28, 2019}}</ref> [[Joe Strummer]] of [[The Clash]] listed Minutemen as one of the ultimate punk bands along with [[Ramones]], [[Television Personalities]], and [[Buzzcocks]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weisbard|first=Eric|title=Joe Stummer: The word on punk past and present from the former Clash frontman|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|number=5|volume=17|page=90|date=May 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EdRggHm3lkoC&q=%22Big+ups+to+the+Minutemen%21+%22&pg=PA90}}</ref>

In the early 2000s, the instrumental portions of the Minutemen song "[[Corona (song)|Corona]]" (off ''Double Nickels'') was the main theme song of the [[MTV]] reality stunt show ''[[Jackass (TV series)|Jackass]]''.

In 2000 Watt, as administrator of the band's publishing, allowed the automaker [[Volvo]] to use the Boon instrumental "Love Dance" (from ''Double Nickels'') in a car ad. Boon's royalties were paid to his father, who was suffering from [[emphysema]]. Watt simply refers to the decision as a way for Boon to help his father from beyond the grave.<ref name="watt_px">{{cite web|author=CJ Marsicano |publisher=Project X Webzine |title=A Conversation with Mike Watt, Pt. 2 |url=http://www.proj-ex.info/interviews/mikewatt_2001_2.htm |date=2001-08-07 |access-date=2007-06-11 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404220943/http://www.proj-ex.info/interviews/mikewatt_2001_2.htm |archive-date=April 4, 2005 }}</ref>

Since 2001 Watt and Hurley have done occasional gigs, mainly in the L.A. area except for two December 2004 shows in [[England]], playing Minutemen songs as a duo with no guitarist. At some of these gigs, Watt would set up one of Boon's old guitars and amps on the side of the stage where Boon used to stand. These performances, at Watt's insistence, are to be billed strictly as "George Hurley and Mike Watt". They are also now involved in an improvisational music group, [[Unknown Instructors]], with members of [[Saccharine Trust]] and [[Pere Ubu (band)|Pere Ubu]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The group's career is chronicled in the book ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', a study of 13 important American [[Underground music|underground]] rock groups by veteran music journalist [[Michael Azerrad]]. The title is taken from the lyrics to the ''Double Nickels'' track "History Lesson – Part II."<ref name="Azerrad2012">{{cite book|author=Michael Azerrad|title=Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground, 1981-1991|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o7CZRPZ27TQC&pg=PT13|access-date=22 January 2013|date=1 December 2012|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc.|isbn=978-0-316-24718-4|pages=13–}}</ref>

In 2003 Watt released his own book on Minutemen, ''Spiels of a Minuteman'', which contains all of Watt's song lyrics from the Minutemen era as well as the tour journal he wrote during Minutemen's only [[Europe]]an tour with Black Flag, essays by former [[SST Records|SST]] co-owner [[Joe Carducci]], [[Sonic Youth]]'s [[Thurston Moore]], [[Blue Öyster Cult]] lyricist and longtime Watt hero [[Richard Meltzer]], and illustrations by [[Raymond Pettibon]] that had been used in all of Minutemen's album artwork.

==Economical practices==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}
The group's early recordings (up until their 1985 [[extended play|12" EP]] ''[[Project: Mersh]]'') were recorded as "econo" (Pedro [[slang]] for inexpensive, short for "economical") as possible – the group would book studio time after midnight at cut rates, tech their own shows, practice the songs before going into the studio, record on less-expensive used tape, and record the songs in the order they intended to have them on the record rather than waste time editing the master tape during the sequencing phase. In fact, contrary to standard practice even in indie rock, Minutemen sometimes saw records as a way to promote their tours, not the other way around.

Minutemen toured frequently, but usually for only a few weeks at a time – they all held down day jobs. Their "econo" practices helped ensure that their tours were generally profitable.

==Album art==
Several Minutemen album sleeves and covers, such as the ''[[Paranoid Time]]'' EP and ''[[What Makes a Man Start Fires?]]'' LP and the inner [[gatefold]] jacket for ''[[Double Nickels on the Dime]]'', feature drawings by noted artist [[Raymond Pettibon]], who was at the time associated with the SST label. Other album covers, like on ''[[The Punch Line]]'', ''[[Project Mersh|Project: Mersh]]'', and ''[[3-Way Tie (For Last)]]'', featured paintings by Boon.
