== Early life and education ==
Anderson was born in [[Glen Ellyn, Illinois]], on June 5, 1947, the daughter of Mary Louise (née Rowland) and Arthur T. Anderson.<ref name="filmreference">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/1/Laurie-Anderson.html |title=Laurie Anderson Biography (1947–) |website=Filmreference.com |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> She had seven siblings, and on weekends she studied painting at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]] and played with the [[Chicago Youth Symphony Orchestras|Chicago Youth Symphony]].<ref name="Anderson 2021" /> She graduated from [[Glenbard West High School]].

In 1970, she drew the [[underground comix]] ''Baloney Moccasins'', which was published by [[George DiCaprio]]. In the early 1970s, she worked as an art instructor, as an art critic for magazines such as ''[[Artforum]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazings.com/articles/article0026.html |title=Music Article 0026 |website=Amazings.com |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> and illustrated children's books<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/art21/artists/anderson/index.html |title=Art:21 .

== Career ==
=== 1970s ===
Anderson performed in New York during the 1970s.  One of her most-cited performances, ''Duets on Ice'', which she conducted in New York and other cities around the world, involved her playing the violin along with a recording while wearing ice skates with the blades frozen into a block of ice; the performance ended only when the ice had melted away. Two early pieces, "New York Social Life" and "Time to Go," are included in the 1977 compilation ''New Music for Electronic and Recorded Media'', along with works by [[Pauline Oliveros]] and others.<ref name="Amirkhanian" /> Two other pieces were included on ''[https://www.discogs.com/Various-Airwaves/release/789843 Airwaves]'', a collection of audio pieces by various artists. She also recorded a lecture for ''[https://www.discogs.com/Various-Vision-4-Word-Of-Mouth/release/1146841 Vision]'', a set of artist's lectures released by [[Crown Point Press]] as a set of six LPs.

Many of Anderson's earliest recordings remain unreleased or were issued only in limited quantities, such as her first single, "It's Not the Bullet that Kills You (It's the Hole)." That song, along with "New York Social Life" and about a dozen others, was originally recorded for use in an art installation that consisted of a [[jukebox]] that played the different Anderson compositions, at the [[Holly Solomon Gallery]] in New York City. Among the musicians on these early recordings are [[Peter Gordon (composer)|Peter Gordon]] on saxophone, [[Scott Johnson (composer)|Scott Johnson]] on guitar, Ken Deifik on harmonica, and Joe Kos on drums. Photographs and descriptions of many of these early performances were included in Anderson's retrospective book ''Stories from the Nerve Bible''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.otherminds.org/shtml/Anderson.shtml |title=Laurie Anderson |website=Otherminds.org |access-date=October 2, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927011010/http://www.otherminds.org/shtml/Anderson.shtml |archive-date=September 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

During the late 1970s, Anderson made a number of additional recordings that were either released privately or included on compilations of avant-garde music, most notably releases by the [[Giorno Poetry Systems]] label run by New York poet [[John Giorno]], an early intimate of [[Andy Warhol]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Laurie+Anderson|title=Laurie Anderson profile at|website=Discogs.com |date=June 5, 1947|access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> In 1978, she performed at the Nova Convention, a major conference involving many counter-culture figures and rising avant-garde musical stars, including [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Philip Glass]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[Timothy Leary]], [[Malcolm Goldstein]], [[John Cage]], and [[Allen Ginsberg]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ubu.com/sound/nova.html|title=UbuWeb Sound – The Dial-A-Poem Poets: The Nova Convention |website=Ubu.com|access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> She also worked with comedian [[Andy Kaufman]] in the late 1970s.<ref>Laurie Anderson, ''Stories from the Nerve Bible''.</ref>

=== 1980s ===
In 1980, Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate from the [[San Francisco Art Institute]]. In 1982, she was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] for Creative Arts—Film.<ref name=Handy1989 /> In 1987, Anderson was awarded an honorary doctorate in the fine arts from the [[University of the Arts (Philadelphia)|University of the Arts]] in Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web |title=Laurie Anderson at 1987 [UArts] commencement |url=http://collections.library.uarts.edu/digital/collection/photohist/id/144/rec/3 |website=UArts Libraries Digital Collections |access-date=9 December 2020 |location=Philadelphia, PA |language=en |date=16 May 1987}}</ref>

Anderson became widely known outside the art world in 1981 with the single "[[O Superman]]," originally released in a limited quantity by [[B. George]]'s One Ten Records, which ultimately reached number two on the British charts. The sudden influx of orders from the UK (prompted partly by British station [[BBC Radio 1]] playlisting the record) led to Anderson signing a seven-album deal with [[Warner Bros. Records]], which re-released the single.<ref>{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TRb8UlRIzh0C&q=Anderson+became+widely+known+outside+the+art+world+in+1981+with+the+single+%22O+Superman%22%2C&pg=PA175 | title=Singularia: Being at an Edge in Time: a Meditation and Thought Experiment While Crossing the Galactic Core | publisher=Alchemica Productions| first=James M. |last=Harvey | year=2009 | pages=187 | isbn=978-0-9807574-1-5}}</ref>

"O Superman" was part of a larger stage work titled ''[[United States (Anderson)|United States]]'' and was included on the album ''[[Big Science (Laurie Anderson album)|Big Science]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laurieanderson.com/news|title=Laurie Anderson official web site |website=Laurieanderson.com|access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> Prior to the release of ''Big Science'', Anderson returned to Giorno Poetry Systems to record the album ''[[You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With]]''; Anderson recorded one side of the double-LP set, with William S. Burroughs and John Giorno recording a side each, and the fourth side featured a separate groove for each artist. This was followed by the back-to-back releases of her albums ''[[Mister Heartbreak]]'' and ''[[United States Live]]'', the latter of which was a five-LP (and, later, four-CD) recording of her two-evening stage show at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.<ref name="filmreference" /> She also appeared in a television special produced by [[Nam June Paik]] broadcast on New Year's Day 1984, titled "[[Good Morning, Mr. Orwell]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/blog/asia/good-morning-mr-orwell-look-back-nam-june-paik-video-greeted-1984|title='Good Morning Mr. Orwell': A Look Back at the Nam June Paik Video That Greeted 1984|first=Emily|date=September 5, 2014|publisher=Asia Society|work=asiasociety.org|access-date=11 April 2016|author=Feng}}</ref>

She next starred in and directed the 1986 concert film ''[[Home of the Brave (1986 film)|Home of the Brave]]'' and also composed the soundtracks for the [[Spalding Gray]] films ''[[Swimming to Cambodia]]'' and ''[[Monster in a Box]]''.  During this time, she also contributed music to Robert Wilson's "[[Alcestis]]" at the American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She also hosted the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] series ''[[Alive from Off Center]]'' during 1987, after having produced the short film ''[[What You Mean We?]]'' for the series the year before. ''What You Mean We?'' introduced a new character played by Anderson: "The Clone," a digitally altered masculine counterpart to Anderson who later "co-hosted" with her when she did her presenting stint on ''Alive from Off Center''. Elements of The Clone were later incorporated into the titular "puppet" of her later work, ''Puppet Motel''. In that year, she also appeared on [[Peter Gabriel]]'s album ''[[So (album)|So]]'', in the song "This is the Picture (Excellent Birds)."

Release of Anderson's first post-''Home of the Brave'' album, 1989's ''[[Strange Angels (Laurie Anderson album)|Strange Angels]]'', was delayed for more than a year in order for Anderson to take singing lessons. This was due to the album being more musically inclined (in terms of singing) than her previous works.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=Laurie+Anderson |title=CG: Laurie Anderson |first=Robert |last=Christgau |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref> The single "Babydoll" was a moderate hit on the Modern Rock Charts in 1989.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991, she was a member of the jury at the [[41st Berlin International Film Festival]].<ref name="Berlinale">{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1991/04_jury_1991/04_Jury_1991.html |title=Berlinale: 1991 Juries |access-date=March 21, 2011 |work=berlinale.de}}</ref> In the same year, Anderson appeared in ''[[Arena (UK TV series)|The Human Face]]'', a feature arts documentary directed by artist-filmmakers [[Nichola Bruce]] and Michael Coulson for BBC television. Anderson was the presenter in this documentary on the history of the face in art and science. Her face was transformed using latex masks and digital special effects as she introduced ideas about the relationship between [[physiognomy]] and perception. Her varied career in the early 1990s included voice-acting in the animated film ''[[The Rugrats Movie]]''.  In 1994, she created a [[CD-ROM]] titled ''Puppet Motel'', which was followed by ''[[Bright Red]]'', co-produced by [[Brian Eno]], and another spoken-word album, ''[[The Ugly One with the Jewels]]''. This was followed by an appearance on the 1997 charity single "[[Perfect Day (Lou Reed song)|Perfect Day]]."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0002173/|title=Laurie Anderson|website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref>

In 1996, Anderson performed with Diego Frenkel (La Portuária) and [[Aterciopelados]] for the AIDS benefit album ''[[Silencio=Muerte: Red Hot + Latin]]'' produced by the [[Red Hot Organization]].

An interval of more than half a decade followed before her next album release. During this time, she wrote a supplemental article on the cultural character of New York City for the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''<ref>"[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/07/16/encyclopaedia-anderson Encyclopaedia Anderson]", ''[[The New Yorker]]'', July 16, 2001</ref> and created a number of multimedia presentations, most notably one inspired by ''[[Moby-Dick]]'' (''Songs and Stories from Moby Dick'', 1999–2000).<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Arts/9906/04/review.spoleto.laurie/ | work=CNN | access-date=May 7, 2010 | title=Review: Laurie Anderson's 'Moby' – the big blubber}}</ref> One of the central themes in Anderson's work is exploring the effects of technology on human relationships and communication.

Starting in the 1990s, Anderson and [[Lou Reed]], whom she had met in 1992, collaborated on a number of recordings together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/vault/anderson/ander_transcript.html |title=Interview With Laurie Anderson |website=Transmitmedia.com |access-date=October 2, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930122731/http://www.transmitmedia.com/svr/vault/anderson/ander_transcript.html |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reed contributed to the tracks "In Our Sleep" from Anderson's ''[[Bright Red]]'', "One Beautiful Evening" from Anderson's ''[[Life on a String (album)|Life on a String]]'', and "My Right Eye" and "Only an Expert" from Anderson's ''[[Homeland (Laurie Anderson album)|Homeland]]'', which Reed also co-produced. Anderson contributed to the tracks "Call on Me" from Reed's collaborative project ''[[The Raven (Lou Reed album)|The Raven]],'' "Rouge" and "Rock Minuet" from Reed's ''[[Ecstasy (Lou Reed album)|Ecstasy]]'', and "Hang On to Your Emotions" from Reed's ''[[Set the Twilight Reeling]]''.

=== 2000s ===
[[File:The Kitchen Benefit, Honoring Laurie Anderson.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Anderson at a 2007 benefit concert]]
''[[Life on a String (album)|Life on a String]]'' appeared in 2001, by which time she signed a new contract with another Warner Music label, [[Nonesuch Records]]. ''Life on a String'' was a mixture of new works (including one song recalling the death of her father) and works from the ''Moby Dick'' presentation.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/laurieanderson/albums/album/111744/review/5941827/life_on_a_string |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114081304/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/laurieanderson/albums/album/111744/review/5941827/life_on_a_string |archive-date=January 14, 2009 | url-status=dead |title=Laurie Anderson: Life on a String}}</ref> In 2001, she recorded the audiobook version of [[Don DeLillo]]'s novel ''[[The Body Artist]]''. Anderson went on tour performing a selection of her best-known musical pieces in 2001. One of these performances was recorded in New York City a week after the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], and included a performance of "O Superman." This concert was released in early 2002 as the double CD ''Live in New York''.<ref>{{cite web|last=May |first=Krista L. |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/a/andersonlaurie-live.shtml |title=Laurie Anderson: Live in New York – PopMatters Music Review |website=Popmatters.com |access-date=October 2, 2011}}</ref>

In 2003, Anderson became [[NASA]]'s first [[artist-in-residence]], which inspired her performance piece ''The End of the Moon''.<ref>{{cite web|last=Stamberg|first=Susan|title=NASA Gives Space to Artist in Residence|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=3114007|publisher=NPR|access-date=February 8, 2011|date=July 3, 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A15916-2004Jun29.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Moon and Stars Align for Performance Artist | date=June 30, 2004 | access-date=May 7, 2010}}</ref> She mounted a succession of themed shows and composed a piece for [[Expo 2005]] in Japan. In 2005, Anderson visited Russia's space program—the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre and mission control—with [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]] and took part in [[Arts Catalyst|The Arts Catalyst]]'s Space Soon event at the Roundhouse to reflect on her experiences. She was part of the team that created the opening ceremony for the [[2004 Olympic Games]] in Athens. Later that year, she collaborated with choreographer [[Trisha Brown]] and filmmaker [[Agnieszka Wojtowicz-Vosloo]] on the acclaimed multimedia project ''O Zlozony/O Composite'' for the [[Paris Opera Ballet]]. The ballet premiered at the [[Opera Garnier]] in Paris in December 2004.

[[File:Laurie Anderson Homeland 3.jpg|thumb|left|Anderson performing ''Homeland'' in 2007]]
In 2005, her exhibition ''The Waters Reglitterized'' opened at the [[Sean Kelly Gallery]] in New York City. According to the press release by Sean Kelly,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.laurieanderson.com/public/pdf/WatersPressRelease.pdf |title=Sean Kelly : Laurie Anderson : The Waters Reglitterized |website=Laurieanderson.com |access-date=April 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803135154/http://www.laurieanderson.com/public/pdf/WatersPressRelease.pdf |archive-date=August 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the work is a diary of dreams and their literal recreation as works of art. This work, created in the process of re-experiencing or re-working her dreams while awake, uses the language of dreams to investigate the dream itself. The resulting pieces include drawings, prints, and high-definition video. The installation ran until October 22, 2005.

In 2006, Anderson was awarded a [[List of Fellows of the American Academy in Rome 1991–2010|Residency]] at the [[American Academy in Rome]]. She narrated [[Ric Burns]]' ''[[Andy Warhol: A Documentary Film]]'', which was first televised in September 2006 as part of the PBS ''[[American Masters]]'' series. She contributed a song to ''[[Plague Songs]]'', a collection of songs related to the 10 Biblical plagues. Anderson also performed in [[Came So Far for Beauty]], the Leonard Cohen tribute event held in the Point Theatre, Dublin, Ireland, on October 4–5, 2006. In November 2006, she published a book of drawings based on her dreams, titled ''Night Life''.

Material from ''Homeland'' was performed at small work-in-progress shows in New York throughout May 2007, most notably at the Highline Ballroom on May 17-18, supported by a four-piece band with spontaneous lighting and video visuals mixed live throughout the performances by [[Willie Williams (lighting designer)|Willie Williams]] and [[Mark Coniglio]], respectively. A European tour of the ''Homeland'' work in progress then took place, including performances on September 28-29, 2007, at the Olympia Theatre, Dublin; on October 17-19 at the Melbourne International Arts Festival; in Russia at the Moscow Dom Muzyky concert hall on April 26, 2008. The work was performed across the Atlantic in Toronto, Canada, on June 14, 2008, with husband [[Lou Reed]], making the "Lost Art of Conversation" a duet with vocals and guitar, with his ambling style contrasting with Anderson's tightly wound performance. Anderson's ''Homeland Tour'' performed at several locations across the United States as well, such as at the [[Ferst Center for the Arts]], Atlanta, Georgia; The [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]], New York City; and [[Harris Theater (Chicago)|Harris Theater]] for Music and Dance in [[Millennium Park]], Chicago, Illinois, co-presented by the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.laurieanderson.com/appearances/2008.shtml | title=Calendar | publisher=Laurie Anderson | access-date=August 8, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907055605/http://www.laurieanderson.com/appearances/2008.shtml | archive-date=September 7, 2011 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== 2020s ===
Laurie Anderson was appointed the 2021 [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|Charles Eliot Norton Professor of Poetry]] at [[Harvard University]] and presented a series of [[Charles Eliot Norton Lectures|six lectures]] titled ''Spending the War Without You: Virtual Backgrounds'' over the course of the spring and fall semesters.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Norton Lectures|url=https://mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu/norton-lectures|access-date=2021-01-14|website=mahindrahumanities.fas.harvard.edu|language=en}}</ref>

In 2021, Anderson created a show on the second floor of the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden|Hirshhorn Museum]] in Washington, D.C., titled "The Weather" and described by ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "a sort of nonretrospective retrospective of one of America’s major, and majorly confounding, modern artists."<ref name="Anderson 2021">{{cite news |last1=Anderson |first1=Sam |title=Laurie Anderson Has a Message for Us Humans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/magazine/laurie-anderson.html |access-date=7 October 2021 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 6, 2021}}</ref>

== Inventions ==
Anderson has invented several [[experimental musical instrument]]s that she has used in her recordings and performances.

=== Tape-bow violin ===
The tape-bow violin is an instrument created by Laurie Anderson in 1977. It uses recorded magnetic tape in place of the traditional horsehair in the bow, and a magnetic tape head in the bridge. Anderson has updated and modified this device over the years. She can be seen using a later generation of this device in her film ''Home of the Brave'' during the ''Late Show with David Letterman'' segment in which she manipulates a sentence recorded by [[William S. Burroughs]]. This version of the violin stopped the use of magnetic tape and instead used [[MIDI|MIDI-based]] audio samples, triggered by contact with the bow.

=== Talking stick ===
The talking stick is a six-foot-long baton-like [[MIDI]] controller. It was used in the ''Moby-Dick'' tour in 1999-2000. She described it in program notes as follows:<ref name=AADL>{{ cite web |url=https://aadl.org/ums/programs_19990930b |title=University Musical Society: 1999 Fall Season (concert program, September 30{{snd}} October 8, 1999)|publisher=University Musical Society, [[University of Michigan Ann Arbor]] |date=September 1999}}</ref>

{{quote|The Talking Stick is a new instrument that I designed in collaboration with a team from [[Interval Research]] and [[Bob Bielecki]]. It is a wireless instrument that can access and replicate any sound. It works on the principle of [[granular synthesis]]. This is the technique of breaking sound into tiny segments, called grains, and then playing them back in different ways. The computer rearranges the sound fragments into continuous strings or random clusters that are played back in overlapping sequences to create new textures. The grains are very short, a few hundredths of a second. Granular synthesis can sound smooth or choppy depending on the size of the grain and the rate at which they're played. The grains are like film frames. If you slow them down enough, you begin to hear them separately.}}

=== Voice filters ===
A recurring motif in Anderson's work is the use of an electric pitch-shifting voice filter that deepens her voice into a [[masculinity|masculine]] register, a technique that Anderson has referred to as "audio [[drag (clothing)|drag]]."<ref name=olympiad>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancouver2010.com/more-2010-information/cultural-festivals-and-events/news/q-a-with-laurie-anderson_268310gd.html |title=Vancouver 2010: Highlights of the Games |website=Vancouver2010.com |access-date=April 24, 2014}}</ref> Anderson has long used the resulting character in her work as a "voice of [[authority]]" or [[conscience]],<ref name=olympiad /> although she later decided that the voice had lost much of its authority and instead began using the voice to provide historical or sociopolitical commentary,<ref name=cbc>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/02/16/f-laurie-anderson-delusion.html |title=Use your delusion |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221013452/http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2010/02/16/f-laurie-anderson-delusion.html |archive-date=February 21, 2010}}</ref> as it is used on "Another Day in America," a piece from her 2010 album ''[[Homeland (Laurie Anderson album)|Homeland]]''.

For much of Anderson's career, the voice was nameless or called the Voice of Authority, although as early as 2009<ref>{{cite web |url=https://rogovoy.com/news1798.html |title=Weekend Cultural Highlights 1.15-1.18 |last=Rogovoy |first=Seth |date=January 14, 2009 |website=The Rogovoy Report |access-date=August 24, 2021 |quote=...historian and social commentator Fenway Bergamot}}</ref> it was dubbed Fenway Bergamot at Lou Reed's suggestion.<ref name=cbc /> The cover of ''Homeland'' depicts Anderson in character as Bergamot, with streaks of black makeup to give her a moustache and thick, masculine eyebrows.

In "The Cultural Ambassador," a piece on her album ''[[The Ugly One with the Jewels]]'', Anderson explained some of her perspective on the character:

{{quote|(''Anderson:'') I was carrying a lot of electronics so I had to keep unpacking everything and plugging it in and demonstrating how it all worked, and I guess I did seem a little fishy—a lot of this stuff wakes up displaying LED program readouts that have names like Atom Smasher, and so it took a while to convince them that they weren't some kind of portable espionage system. So I've done quite a few of these sort of impromptu new music concerts for small groups of detectives and customs agents and I'd have to keep setting all this stuff up and they'd listen for a while and they'd say: So um, what's this? And I'd pull out something like<br />(''Bergamot:'') this filter, and say, now this is what I like to think of as the voice of authority. And it would take me a while to tell them how I used it for songs that were, you know, about various forms of control, and they would say, now why would you want to talk like that? And I'd look around at the [[SWAT]] teams, and the undercover agents, and the dogs, and the radio in the corner, tuned to the Super Bowl coverage of the [[Gulf War|war]]. And I'd say, take a wild guess.}}

The single "Sharkey's Day" was for many years the theme song of [[Lifetime Television]]. Anderson also recorded a number of limited-release singles in the late 1970s (many issued from the [[Holly Soloman Gallery]]), songs from which were included on a number of compilations, including [[Giorno Poetry Systems]]' ''[[The Nova Convention]]'' and ''You're the Guy I Want to Share My Money With''. Over the years she has performed on recordings by other musicians such as [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Lou Reed]], and [[Jean Michel Jarre]]. She also contributed lyrics to the [[Philip Glass]] album ''[[Songs from Liquid Days]]'', and contributed a spoken-word piece to a tribute album in honor of [[John Cage]].

In 2013, Dale Eisinger of [[Complex (magazine)|''Complex'']] ranked ''United States'' as the third greatest work of performance art ever, with the writer arguing that Anderson is "able to ascertain just exactly the climate of life in the United States, without being so punctuated that it causes a standoff. Perhaps the zenith of this configuration was her multimedia performance, 'United States I – IV.' [...] [Anderson displays] her vast, incisive range of talents on the 'United States Live' recordings."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Eisinger|first=Dale|date=2013-04-09|title=The 25 Best Performance Art Pieces of All Time|url=https://www.complex.com/style/2013/04/the-25-best-performance-art-pieces-of-all-time/|access-date=2021-02-28|website=Complex|language=en}}</ref>
