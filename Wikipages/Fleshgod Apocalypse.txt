'''Fleshgod Apocalypse''' is an Italian [[symphonic death metal]] band. Formed in 2007, the group resides in [[Perugia]] and are currently signed to [[Nuclear Blast]]. They have released five full-length albums.
==History==
===Formation and ''Oracles'' (2007–2009)===
Fleshgod Apocalypse was formed in April 2007 by Francesco Paoli (formerly frontman of the band [[Hour of Penance]]). They recorded their first demo, ''Promo '07'', at 16th Cellar Studio, in Rome, with producer Stefano "Saul" Morabito, releasing it shortly after. The demo was re-released the following year on a split CD with fellow Italian bands Septycal Gorge, Modus Delicti and Onirik. Fleshgod Apocalypse then signed to [[Neurotic Records]]. In early 2008 the band toured Europe, supporting bands like [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]], [[Origin (band)|Origin]], [[Dying Fetus]], [[Hate Eternal]], [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]], [[Napalm Death]] and many more.

In May 2008, the band recorded its first full-length album, ''[[Oracles (album)|Oracles]]''. In December of that year the band decided to part ways with Neurotic Records and signed with Willowtip Records, who released ''Oracles'' in 2009. Shortly thereafter, new member, Tommaso Riccardi took over vocals and rhythm guitar, which were previously handled by Francesco Paoli, and Paoli took over the drums, replacing session drummer Francesco Struglia.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Blabbermouth|date=31 March 2009|title=FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE Parts Ways With Drummer|url=https://blabbermouth.herokuapp.com/news/fleshgod-apocalypse-parts-ways-with-drummer/|access-date=7 August 2020|website=BLABBERMOUTH.NET}}</ref>

===''Mafia EP'' and ''Agony'' (2009–2012)===
In 2010, the ''[[Mafia (Fleshgod Apocalypse album)|Mafia]]'' EP was recorded, again at 16th Cellar Studios, and was released via Willowtip Records. It includes four new tracks and a cover of the track "Blinded by Fear" by [[At the Gates]]. The band embarked on another European tour shortly after the end of the ''Mafia'' recording sessions, supporting [[Suffocation (band)|Suffocation]]. Following this tour was a headlining tour of Russia.

Until 2010, band founder Francesco Paoli was simultaneously in his former band [[Hour of Penance]] doing vocals, as well as drumming in Fleshgod Apocalypse. He quit Hour of Penance to focus on Fleshgod Apocalypse full-time as drummer and song writer. In November 2010, the band signed a worldwide deal with record label Extreme Management Group, Inc. and began writing for the second full-length album. In May 2011 the band signed a worldwide deal with [[Nuclear Blast Records]] and began wrapping up work on their second album. During this time, another new member, Francesco Ferrini, the pianist and orchestrator of ''Oracles'' and ''Mafia'', was added to the band as the full-time pianist and orchestrator. This addition honed Fleshgod Apocalypse's sound on their upcoming album.

The band released their second album, ''[[Agony (Fleshgod Apocalypse album)|Agony]]'', on 9 August 2011 in North America and 19 August 2011 in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159850|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130624184926/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=159850|url-status=dead|archive-date=24 June 2013|title=FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE: New Album Artwork Unveiled|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]|date=24 June 2011|access-date=20 June 2013}}</ref> The [[iTunes]] version of ''Agony'' also includes a cover of the track "[[Heartwork]]" by [[Carcass (band)|Carcass]].

Fleshgod Apocalypse took part in the 2011 [[Summer Slaughter Tour]] in North America, alongside co-headliners [[Whitechapel (band)|Whitechapel]] and [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]]. The band toured the US with [[Decapitated (band)|Decapitated]] in late 2011. In January 2012, they toured the UK with The Black Dahlia Murder and [[Skeletonwitch]]. During March 2012, Fleshgod Apocalypse toured South Africa, supported by local death metal acts.

On 22 December 2012, the band released a music video for "The Forsaking" from the album ''Agony''.<ref>{{cite web|title=FLESHGOD APOCALYPSE: 'The Forsaking' Video Released|date=22 December 2012|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=183970|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]|access-date=23 December 2012}}</ref>
