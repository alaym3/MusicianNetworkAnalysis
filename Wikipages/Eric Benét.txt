'''Eric Benét Jordan''' (born October 15, 1966) is an American [[R&B]]/[[neo soul]] singer-songwriter and actor, who has received a total of four [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations to date for his musical work.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Benét was born on October 15, 1966 in [[Mobile, Alabama]] and raised in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. He is the youngest of five siblings.

=== Career ===
Benét sang with a Top 100-style group called Gerard in the late 1980s. Benét, his sister Lisa, and his cousin George Nash Jr. formed a band called Benét and released a self-titled album in 1992, and it went on to sell over 100,000 copies. Two years later, Eric Benét broke onto the music scene with his solo career and signed with Warner Bros. Records, releasing his debut solo album, ''True to Myself'' in 1996. His second album, ''A Day in the Life'', was released in 1999 and featured his smash hit "[[Spend My Life With You]] (featuring Tamia)". The song rose to No. 1 on the US Billboard R&B charts (for 3 weeks), was certified gold, and nominated for a 2000 Grammy Award for "Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group". The album also won a Soul Train Music Award for "Best R&B/Soul Album, Male".

Benét's career, however, was interrupted by a series of personal tragedies. His father died of cancer. In addition, his girlfriend, Tami Marie Stauff, died on April 24, 1993, from injuries suffered in an automobile accident, leaving Eric a single father to their one-year-old daughter, India (born December 4, 1991).

In 1994, Benét signed with [[Warner Bros. Records]], releasing his solo debut album, ''[[True to Myself]]'' in 1996.  Individual songs from the album were successful, including the top-ten R&B hits "Spiritual Thang", "Femininity" and "Let's Stay Together", which originally appeared on the soundtrack of the film ''[[A Thin Line Between Love and Hate]]''.

In between albums, Eric collaborated with his then-labelmates [[Somethin' for the People]] on their 1997 album ''This Time It's Personal'' singing leads on the single "Act Like You Want It". His next album, ''[[A Day in the Life (Eric Benét album)|A Day in the Life]]'', was released in 1999.  Its first single, "[[Georgy Porgy (song)|Georgy Porgy]] (featuring [[Faith Evans]])" received significant airplay, but the second single, "[[Spend My Life With You]] (featuring [[Tamia]])", became a smash hit. "Spend My Life With You" rose to number one on the American R&B charts, was certified [[RIAA certification|gold]], and nominated for a 2000 [[Grammy Award]] for Best R&B Performance by a Duo or Group. The album, ''A Day in the Life'' also won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&B/Soul Album, Male.

Benét also recorded for [[Earth, Wind, and Fire]]'s 30th anniversary CD. He contributed vocals to the post-Katrina charity single, "Heart of America", along with Michael McDonald, Wynonna Judd, and Terry Dexter. He has also lent his vocals to many jazz albums for such artists as Wayman Tisdale, George Duke, Chris Botti, Jeff Lorber, and Boney James.

Benét recorded his following album ''[[Better and Better (Eric Benét album)|Better and Better]]'' in 2001, but Warner Bros. rejected to release this album and forced him to stay in the R&B genre. Due to the controversy about music style and creative freedom, Benét changed to [[Reprise Records|Reprise]]-distributed label [[Tim Blixseth|Friday Records]] and recorded his next album, ''[[Hurricane (Eric Benét album)|Hurricane]].''<ref>[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/benet-clashed-with-warner-bros-over-genre Eric Benet – Benet Clashed With Warner Bros Over Genre].
