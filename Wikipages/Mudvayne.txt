Nothingface guitarist [[Tom Maxwell (guitarist)|Tom Maxwell]] became friends with Mudvayne vocalist [[Chad Gray]], and they explored the possibility of a [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]]. The following year, Nothingface again toured with Mudvayne; although plans for a supergroup continued, they were put on hold due to scheduling conflicts. Gray and Maxwell had discussed five names for the group, and Mudvayne guitarist Greg Tribbett approached Maxwell "out of the blue" to join it. Although Nothingface drummer Tommy Sickles played on the group's demo, the search for another drummer began.<ref name="Rvr">Jon Wiederhorn, "Hellyeah: Night Riders", ''[[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]]'', March 2007, p. 60-64 ([http://www.revolvermag.com/features/index.html link to ''Revolver'' back issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928225752/http://www.revolvermag.com/features/index.html |date=September 28, 2007 }})</ref>

===''The End of All Things to Come'' and ''Lost and Found'' (2002–2005)===
In 2002, Mudvayne released ''[[The End of All Things to Come]]'', which the band considers its "black album" due to its largely-black artwork.<ref name=blacklight>{{cite news|title=MUDVAYNE Frontman Sees The (Black) Light|website=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=November 13, 2009|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130358|access-date=November 14, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120132826/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130358|archive-date=November 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Solitude|Isolation]] inspired the album's songs. During its mixing, Gray and McDonough stopped at [[Bob's Big Boy]] and Gray remembered overhearing someone "say something like, '&nbsp;... and he's got to cut his own eye out'". When he asked McDonough if he heard the conversation McDonough said he hadn't, and Gray thought it was someone discussing a scene from a screenplay.<ref name=Harris />

In 2005, Chad Gray established [[independent record label]] Bullygoat Records and [[Bloodsimple]]'s debut album, ''[[A Cruel World]]'' (with a guest appearance by Gray), appeared in March.<ref name=loftus-bloodsimple>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-cruel-world-mw0000254976|title=A Cruel World – Bloodsimple|last1=Loftus|first1=Johnny|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=April 14, 2020}}</ref> On April 12, Mudvayne released ''[[Lost and Found (Mudvayne album)|Lost and Found]]''.

In August, former Mudvayne bassist Shawn Barclay released his band Sprung's debut album, mastered by [[King's X]] guitarist [[Ty Tabor]].<ref name=sprung /> That month, rumors spread that Bullygoat Records would release ''We Pay Our Debt Sometimes: A Tribute to [[Alice In Chains]]'', with performances by Mudvayne, [[Cold (band)|Cold]], [[Audioslave]], [[Breaking Benjamin]], [[Static-X]] and the surviving members of Alice in Chains.

In September, the band met with director [[Darren Lynn Bousman]], whose film ''[[Saw II]]'' was in production and would include "[[Forget to Remember]]" from ''Lost and Found''. Bousman showed them a scene of a man cutting his eye out of his skull to retrieve a key. When Gray told Bousman about the conversation at Bob's Big Boy two years earlier, Bousman said he holds his production meetings at the restaurant and ''Saw II'' was based on a screenplay he wrote years earlier.<ref name=Harris /> Gray appeared briefly in the film, and the music video for "Forget to Remember" contained clips from ''Saw II''.<ref name=Harris>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512822/mudvayne-saw-ii-director-share-big-boy-moment.jhtml|title='Saw II' Eye-Plucking Scene: A Fateful Moment For Mudvayne|author=Harris, Chris|access-date=October 5, 2011|date=November 2, 2005|publisher=[[MTV News]]}}</ref>
