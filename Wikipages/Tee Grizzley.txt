==Early life==
Wallace was born on March 23, 1994, in [[Detroit, Michigan]], and was raised by his grandmother in the Joy Rd. & Southfield neighborhood due to his mother and father constantly being in and out of prison.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMqWRtGhOQI Tee Grizzley's Off Parole Documentary]</ref> In middle school he began developing an interest in [[rap music]] and eventually formed the musical group All Stars Ball Hard along with three of his friends, JR, Po, and Lee. Wallace took the [[stage name|moniker]] of ASBH Tee, and they began uploading their songs to [[YouTube]]. In 2011, his mother was sentenced to 20 years in prison for drug trafficking. His father was murdered in 2012.

Wallace was the first member of his family to attend college in generations, and attended [[Michigan State University]] to study finance and accounting, but, after undergoing financial difficulties, he and a friend of his began robbing other students' dormitories, and stole $20,000 worth of electronics and money from other students in February 2014. On February 27, Wallace and Jeremy Ford were caught but released pending investigation. Wallace went on the run, and fled to [[Kentucky]], where, on July 1, 2014, Wallace was one of three people arrested following an attempted robbery at a jewelry store in [[Lexington, Kentucky]].<ref>[https://www.wtvq.com/2014/07/02/three-arrested-following-robbery-attempt/ Three Arrested Following Robbery Attempt] WTVQ - July 2, 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.kentucky.com/news/local/crime/article44496003.html Security measures thwarted robbery, The Castle owner says] Lexington Herald Leader</ref> Wallace was sentenced to nine months for the robbery, and, while already serving that sentence, he was sentenced to 18 months to 15 years for the Michigan State robberies in September 2015.<ref>[http://www.argusleader.com/story/news/local/2015/10/02/msu-dorm-robbery-sentence/73225576/ Former MSU student sentenced in 2014 dorm thefts] Argus Leader - October 2, 2015</ref> On October 16, 2016, he was released from prison in Michigan.<ref>[http://www.vibe.com/2017/04/tee-grizzley-releases-his-debut-project-my-moment/ Tee Grizzley Releases His Debut Project, 'My Moment'] VIBE</ref>
