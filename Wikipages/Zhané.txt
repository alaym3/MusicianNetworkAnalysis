'''Zhané''' ({{IPAc-en|ʒ|a:|ˈ|n|eɪ}} {{Respell|zhah|NAY}}) was an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]<ref name="AMBio"/> duo, best known for their 1993 hit "[[Hey Mr. D.J. (Zhané song)|Hey Mr. D.J.]]", which reached No. 6 on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.song-database.com/chhist.php?sid=11956&from=spu&type=ht|title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart History: Hey Mr. DJ|publisher=Song-database.com|access-date=2013-06-29}}</ref> Other popular hits include "[[Groove Thang]]" (U.S. No. 17) and minor hit "[[Sending My Love]]", both released in 1994. The group was part of [[Queen Latifah]]'s [[Flavor Unit]] collective.

==Biography==

===Beginnings===
Renée Neufville and Jean Norris initially met in the early 1990s, while both were attending [[Philadelphia]]'s [[Temple University]]; they would sing together at talent shows and other events.  In her youth, Norris' father, Dennis, was a pastor at the Second Baptist Church in [[Moorestown, New Jersey]], and Norris herself was a member of the choir. Although they were not yet a group, Neufville and Norris collaborated on each other's songs. In 1991, the pair met [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]] and did their first professional recording together, [[Ring My Bell (DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince song)|"Ring My Bell"]], which was on the same album that featured [[DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince]]’s popular hit "Summertime".  Former [[Warner Bros.]] executive Benny Medina suggested they become a group. For the name, Neufville had the idea of using the French pronunciation of their first names Jean and Renée, which sounded like "Jahnay". According to Norris “We added a 'Z' for a little flavor and we came up with Zhané."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soultrain.com/2011/11/17/soul-flashback-zhane’s-jean-baylor-talks-about-life-as-a-solo-artist/|title=Soul Flashback: Zhané’s Jean Baylor Talks About Life as a Solo Artist|website=Soultrain.com|access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> The twist they gave their name is similar to naming patterns that have been used all around the world, especially in [[Black communities]].

===Breakthrough & ''Pronounced Jah-Nay''===
Given a high-profile spot on the all-star compilation  ''Roll Wit Tha Flava''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/roll-wit-tha-flava-mw0000096440|title=Roll Wit Tha Flava - Various Artists - Songs, Reviews, Credits - AllMusic|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> as their first recording opportunity, Zhané came away with one of the hip-hop party anthems of all time, "Hey, Mr. D.J." After meeting [[Naughty by Nature]] member Kay Gee, Zhané (then credited as Jhané) impressed the producer enough to go right into the studio to record for ''Roll Wit tha Flava''. When "Hey, Mr. D.J." was released as a separate single as well, it hit number six on the pop charts and earned the group a contract with [[Motown Records|Motown]] in 1994. Their debut album, ''Pronounced Jah-Nay'', produced two further Top 40 hits ("Groove Thang," "Sending My Love") and went gold by the end of the year; it achieved platinum status two years later. Zhané kept busy during 1995–1996 with spots on tracks by [[Busta Rhymes]] and [[De La Soul]] as well as new songs of their own on the [[NFL]] Jams and [[NBA]] 50th Anniversary compilations and the soundtracks to ''[[Higher Learning]]'' and ''[[A Low Down Dirty Shame]]'' — the latter, "Shame," became their fourth Top 40 hit.

===''Saturday Night''===
Norris and Neufville released the follow-up album ''Saturday Night'' in 1997, co-produced by Kay Gee, Eddie F., and themselves. The release featured the hit single "Request Line." A remix with different lyrics and raps by [[Queen Latifah]] followed. It peaked just outside the Top 40.

===Group dissolution and solo projects===
Since the group's dissolution, Jean Norris married musician Marcus Baylor,<ref name="1_Marcus">{{cite web|url=http://www.marcusbaylor.com/|title=The Baylor Project|website=The Baylor Project|access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> perhaps best known as the drummer in jazz fusion ensemble, the [[Yellowjackets]] from 2000 to 2010. Jean Baylor released the solo album ''Testimony: My Life'' in 2007 and a contemporary Christmas album entitled ''Light Up the World'' in November 2011. She later formed an R&B/jazz duo with her husband named [[The Baylor Project]] and they released their debut album ''The Baylor Project (The Journey)'' in February 2017. In November 2017, the duo received two [[60th Grammy Awards]]-nominations under Best Jazz Vocal Album and Best Traditional R&B Performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/music/kevin-johnson/the-baylor-project-with-st-louis-marcus-baylor-earns-grammy/article_8be07b58-2402-5728-afe9-6b30a797e1f1.html|title=The Baylor Project with St. Louis' Marcus Baylor earns 2 Grammy nods|first=Kevin C.|last=Johnson|website=Stltoday.com}}</ref>

Neufville hosted an early live internet series called ''88 Soul'' where guests included well-known R&B/Neo-Soul artists such as Jill Scott, Carl Thomas, Kelis, and Joe. She later contributed to albums and videos by the likes of India.Arie, Will Downing, Heather Headley, Leela James and Aaliyah amongst others. She became involved in [[Roy Hargrove]]'s RH Factor project and figured prominently on the 2006 release ''Distractions'' playing keyboards and contributing lead vocals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/reneeneufville |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202222050/http://www.vervemusicgroup.com/reneeneufville |archive-date=2013-12-02 }}</ref>
