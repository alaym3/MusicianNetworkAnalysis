'''William Royce '''"'''Boz'''"''' Scaggs''' (born June 8, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist.<ref name="strong2000" /> He became prominent for his series of albums in the late 1970s, and songs "[[Lido Shuffle]]" and "[[Lowdown (Boz Scaggs song)|Lowdown]]" from ''[[Silk Degrees]]'' (1976), which peaked at No. 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Scaggs continues to write, record music, and tour.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bozscaggs.com |title=Boz Scaggs Official Website &#124; Home |publisher=Bozscaggs.com |access-date=2015-11-04}}</ref>

==Early life and career==
Scaggs was born in [[Canton, Ohio]],<ref name="strong2000" /> the eldest child of a traveling salesman. Their family moved to [[McAlester, Oklahoma]], then to [[Plano, Texas]] (at that time a farm town), just north of Dallas. He attended a Dallas private school, [[St. Mark's School of Texas]].{{citation needed|date=October 2021}}

After learning guitar at the age of 12, Scaggs met [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]] at St. Mark's School. In 1959, he became the vocalist for Miller's band, the Marksmen. The pair later attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] together, playing in [[blues]] bands like [[the Ardells]] and the Fabulous Knight Trains.<ref name="strong2000" />

Leaving school, Scaggs briefly joined the burgeoning [[British rhythm and blues|R&B scene in London]], then traveled on to Sweden as a solo performer, and in 1965 recorded his solo debut album, ''[[Boz (album)|Boz]]'', which failed commercially.<ref name="strong2000" /> He also had a brief stint with the band the Other Side with [[Mac MacLeod]] and Jack Downing.

Returning to the U.S., Scaggs promptly headed for the booming [[Psychedelic rock|psychedelic music]] center of [[San Francisco]] in 1967. Linking up with Steve Miller again, he appeared on the [[Steve Miller Band]]'s first two albums, ''[[Children of the Future (Steve Miller Band album)|Children of the Future]]'' and ''[[Sailor (album)|Sailor]]'' in 1968.<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=978-1-85227-745-1|page=1058}}</ref> Scaggs secured a solo contract with [[Atlantic Records]] in 1968, releasing his second album, ''[[Boz Scaggs (album)|Boz Scaggs]]'', featuring the [[Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section]] and [[session guitarist]] [[Duane Allman]], in 1969.<ref name="Larkin" /> Despite good reviews, this release achieved only moderate sales. He then briefly hooked up with Bay Area band [[Mother Earth (American band)|Mother Earth]] in a supporting role on their second album ''[[Mother Earth (American band)|Make a Joyful Noise]]'' on guitar and backup vocals.

Scaggs next signed with [[Columbia Records]] releasing the albums ''[[Moments (Boz Scaggs album)|Moments]]'' in 1971 and ''My Time'' in 1972. His first two Columbia albums were modest sellers and seeking a new more soulful direction his record company brought in former Motown producer [[Johnny Bristol]] for 1974's ''Slow Dancer'' album.<ref name="Larkin" /> Although the album only made # 81 on the US Billboard Album Chart, it subsequently attained gold status no doubt getting a boost from the huge success of Scaggs's next album ''[[Silk Degrees]]''.<ref name="strong2000" />

==1976–1981: the hit years==
In 1976, using session musicians who later formed [[Toto (band)|Toto]], he recorded ''[[Silk Degrees]]'',<ref name="Larkin" /> with [[Joe Wissert]] on producing duties.<ref name="strong2000" /> The album, which received a [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Grammy nomination for album of the year]] and a further nomination for Wissert as Producer of The Year, reached No. 2 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and #1 in a number of other countries, spawning four hit [[single (music)|singles]]: "It's Over", "[[Lowdown (Boz Scaggs song)|Lowdown]]", "What Can I Say", and "[[Lido Shuffle]]",<ref name="strong2000" /> as well as the poignant ballad "[[We're All Alone]]",<ref name="Larkin" /> later recorded by [[Rita Coolidge]] and [[Frankie Valli]]. "Lowdown" sold over one million copies in the US<ref name="roberts2006" /> and won the [[Grammy Award for Best R&B Song]], which was shared by Scaggs and [[David Paich]].

A sellout world tour followed, but his follow-up album in 1977 ''[[Down Two Then Left]]'' did not sell as well as ''Silk Degrees'' and neither of its singles reached the Top 40.<ref name="strong2000" /> The 1980 album ''[[Middle Man (album)|Middle Man]]'' spawned two top 20 hits, "Breakdown Dead Ahead" (No. 15, [[Hot 100]]) and "Jojo" (No. 17, Hot 100); and Scaggs also enjoyed two more top 20 hits in 1980–81, "[[Look What You've Done to Me]]", from the ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'' soundtrack, and "[[Miss Sun]]", from a greatest hits set, both reaching No. 14 on the Hot 100.

==Later career==
[[File:Boz Scaggs in 2006.jpg|thumb|Scaggs in concert in 2006]]
Scaggs took a long break from recording and his next album, ''[[Other Roads]]'', did not appear until 1988.<ref name="Larkin" /> "Heart of Mine", from ''Other Roads'', is Scaggs' last top-40 hit as of 2018.<ref name="strong2000" /> Also in 1988, he opened the San Francisco nightclub, ''[[Slim's]]'', and remained an owner of the venue through the club's closure in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|author=Joel Selvin |url=https://datebook.sfchronicle.com/music/slims-to-close-after-more-than-three-decades-at-heart-of-sfs-music-scene |title=Slim's to close for good after more than three decades at heart of SF's music scene |publisher=Datebook |date=March 20, 2020 |access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref>

From 1989 to 1992, Scaggs joined [[Donald Fagen]], [[Phoebe Snow]], [[Michael McDonald (musician)|Michael McDonald]] and others in [[The New York Rock and Soul Revue]]. His next solo release was the album ''[[Some Change]]'' in 1994. He issued ''[[Come On Home (album)|Come On Home]]'', an album of [[rhythm and blues]],<ref name="Larkin" /> and ''[[My Time: A Boz Scaggs Anthology]]'', an anthology, in 1997.

In the summer of 1998 Boz went on tour as the opening act for Stevie Nicks.

After another hiatus from recording, his next album, ''Dig'', got good reviews, although the CD was released on an unfortunate date{{snd}} [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/dig-mw0000590321|title=Dig – Boz Scaggs &#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=October 2, 2019}}</ref> In May 2003, Scaggs released ''[[But Beautiful (Boz Scaggs album)|But Beautiful]]'', a collection of [[jazz standard]]s that debuted at number one on the jazz chart. In 2008 he released ''Speak Low'', which he described in the liner notes as "a sort of progressive, experimental effort ... along the lines of some of the ideas that Gil Evans explored." During 2004, he released a [[DVD-Video|DVD]] and a live 16-track CD ''[[Greatest Hits Live (Boz Scaggs album)|Greatest Hits Live]]'' that was recorded August 2003 at the [[Great American Music Hall]] in San Francisco.

After a break in recording, he undertook a series of shows across the US in 2008. Two years later he joined [[Donald Fagen]] and [[Michael McDonald (singer)|Michael McDonald]] for concerts entitled the [[Dukes of September Rhythm Revue]]. His next album ''[[Memphis (Boz Scaggs album)|Memphis]]'' was released in March 2013. It was recorded in that Southern American city at the [[Royal Studios]]. The album included some of his favorite compositions from other artists. A tour of the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and [[Japan]] followed the release. Before the year ended, he added live dates across North America and Australia for 2014. In 2015, he released ''A Fool to Care'', a compilation of mostly covers, including "Whispering Pines" with Lucinda Williams, and one original blues composition, "Hell to Pay," performed with [[Bonnie Raitt]]. The album rose to number one on the ''Billboard'' Blues Album chart and number 54 on the Billboard 200.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-fool-to-care-mw0002824086/awards |title=A Fool to Care - Boz Scaggs &#124; Awards |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date=March 31, 2015 |access-date=2015-11-04}}</ref>

==Personal life==
