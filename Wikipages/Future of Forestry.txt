'''Future of Forestry''' is an American indie rock band from [[Southern California]], United States.

== History ==
Future of Forestry is led by multi-instrumentalist, composer, and producer Eric Owyoung. The name comes from a poem by C.S. Lewis, "The Future of Forestry". The project is currently based in Colorado.

The band started in 2006 and released its self-titled debut EP in 2006 under Credential Recordings (EMI). Their first full-length album, ''Twilight'', appeared in 2007, but for the next several years, Owyoung and his collaborators focused on a series of EPs, the ''Travel'' series, with three volumes released between 2009 and 2010.

Another EP series, ''Advent'', devoted to [[Advent]]-themed music, debuted in 2008, with additional installments appearing in 2010 and 2013. In 2011, the ''Travel'' series was collected on a single album, ''The Complete Travel Series'', while the same year, the group issued another compilation, ''A Film and TV Collection'', a limited-edition sampler of music Owyoung created for visual media.

For the 2012 album, ''Young Man Follow'', Owyoung launched his own label, Sound Swan Records. He also opened his own studio, Utopia Road Studios, where he worked on Future of Forestry projects as well as recording and mixing work for other artists.

The following years yielded a 2014 release of the ''Piano & Strings Sessions'', an EP of rearranged Future of Forestry songs orchestrated for piano, strings, and vocals only. In April 2015 an acoustic duet album called "Pages" was released as a surprise to fans on Future of Forestry's website and on iTunes. ''Pages'' was then later released on vinyl as the band's first vinyl pressing.

In 2016 the band released ''Awakened to the Sound,'' and then ''Union'' two years later.

== Sound Swan Records ==
Future of Forestry has released much of their own music on Sound Swan. 

Owyoung has also mixed, performed and attributed production work for former label mate, [[Jon Foreman]]'s ''[[The Wonderlands: Sunlight|Sunlight]]'', ''[[The Wonderlands: Shadows|Shadows]]'', ''[[The Wonderlands: Darkness|Darkness]]'' and ''[[The Wonderlands: Dawn|Dawn]]'',<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://thecellary.com/2017/01/12/interview-with-future-of-forestrys-eric-owyoung/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=September 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930084925/https://thecellary.com/2017/01/12/interview-with-future-of-forestrys-eric-owyoung/ |archive-date=September 30, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> remixes for [[Hillsong United]]'s "Like an Avalanche",<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.multitracks.com/songs/Hillsong-Young-And-Free/III-(Reimagined)/Heart-of-God-(Eric-Owyoung-Remix)/}}</ref> and [[Hillsong Young & Free]]'s Heart of God.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.multitracks.com/songs/Hillsong-Young-And-Free/III-(Reimagined)/Heart-of-God-(Eric-Owyoung-Remix)/}}</ref> and helping produce [[Collington (band)|Collington]]'s EP ''In Between''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Patterson |first1=Jasmin |title=An Interview with Collington |url=https://www.newreleasetoday.com/article.php?article_id=2986 |publisher=NewReleaseToday}}</ref>
