==Musical style==
Childers' music is influenced by his home state of Kentucky and its connection to country music and bluegrass.<ref name=moss>{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/how-songwriter-tyler-childers-became-the-21st-century-voice-of-appalachia-707257/ |title= How Songwriter Tyler Childers Became the 21st Century Voice of Appalachia |first= Marissa R. |last=Moss|work=Rolling Stone |date= August 24, 2018}}</ref> He often writes about coal mining, which was his father's occupation, and its effects. Rebecca Bengal, writing for ''[[The Guardian]]'', described Childers' songs as a "counternarrative to the outsiders who seek to perpetuate stereotypes of backwardness and poverty."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/aug/01/tyler-childers-in-country-music-nobody-is-thinking-about-how-to-move-people |title=Tyler Childers: 'In country music, nobody is thinking about how to move people' |last=Bengal |first=Rebecca |date=August 1, 2019 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref> Childers emphasizes lyrical content in songs, comparing the songwriting process to telling short stories.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/music/ct-ott-tyler-childers-0209-story.html |title=Tyler Childers is, essentially, just a storyteller |last=Dickinson |first=Chrissie |date=February 7, 2018 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]]}}</ref>

In January 2020, Childers maintained his position on Americana during an interview with World Cafe:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Douris |first1=Raina |title=WORLD CAFE PLAYLIST FOR 01/27/2020 |url=http://playlist.worldcafe.org/world-cafe-playlist-01-27-2020-tyler-childers/ |website=World Cafe |access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref>

{{Quote
|text=Everybody always talks about the state of country music and puts down commercial country and [says] "something's gotta be done" and "we need to be elevating artists that are doing more traditional country." But then we're not calling those artists country artists, they're getting put into this Americana thing. It is what it is, and I don't really know how to define what Americana is. We're our own thing, it's a new time, and I don't know what it's called but I've been calling it country, y'know? I think, a lot of times, it's kind of become just a costume.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Langeler |first1=Wes |title=Tyler Childers Doubles Down On Americana Critique: "It’s Kind Of Become Just A Costume" |url=https://www.whiskeyriff.com/2020/01/28/tyler-childers-doubles-down-on-americana-critique-its-kind-of-become-just-a-costume/ |website=Whiskey Riff |access-date=21 September 2020}}</ref>
