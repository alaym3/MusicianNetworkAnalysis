'''Enya Patricia Brennan''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''Eithne Pádraigín Ní Bhraonáin'' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|j|ə}}; born 17 May 1961) is an Irish singer-songwriter and [[musician]], who is best known for her recording of "[[Orinoco Flow]]". Born into a musical family and raised in the Irish-speaking area of [[Gweedore]], [[County Donegal]], Enya began her music career when she joined her family's [[Celtic music|Celtic]] folk band [[Clannad]] in 1980 on keyboards and backing vocals. She left the group in 1982 with their manager and producer [[Nicky Ryan]] to pursue a solo career, with Ryan's wife [[Roma Ryan]] as her lyricist. Enya developed her sound over the following four years with multitracked vocals and keyboards with elements of [[New-age music|new age]], [[Celtic music|Celtic]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[Gregorian chant|church]], [[World music|world]], [[Pop music|pop]], and [[Irish traditional music|Irish folk]]. Thus far, she has sung in ten languages, most notably [[English language|English]], [[Irish language|Irish Gaelic]] (''Gaeilge''), [[Latin]], and [[Welsh language|Welsh]].

Enya's first projects as a solo artist included soundtrack work for ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1984) and the 1987 [[BBC]] documentary series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]'', which was released as her debut album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]'' (1987). She signed with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]], which granted her artistic freedom and minimal interference from the label. The commercial and critical success of ''[[Watermark (Enya album)|Watermark]]'' (1988) propelled her to worldwide fame, helped by the UK number one and international hit single "[[Orinoco Flow]]". This was followed by the multi-million-selling albums ''[[Shepherd Moons]]'' (1991), ''[[The Memory of Trees]]'' (1995), and ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'' (2000). Sales of the latter and its lead single, "[[Only Time]]", surged in the United States following its use in the media coverage of the [[September 11 attacks]]. Following ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]'' (2005) and ''[[And Winter Came...]]'' (2008), Enya took a four-year career hiatus before she resumed in 2012 and released her eighth studio album, ''[[Dark Sky Island]]'' (2015).

Enya is Ireland's best-selling solo artist<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99190609 |title=Enya's New Alrates Winter |publisher=NPR |access-date=14 August 2009}}</ref> and second-best-selling overall behind [[U2]].

== Career ==

=== 1980–1985: Clannad and early solo career ===
In 1970, several members of Enya's family formed [[Clannad]], a [[Celtic music|Celtic]] folk band who later acquired [[Nicky Ryan]] as their manager, sound engineer, and producer, and his future wife, [[Roma Ryan]], as tour manager and administrator.<ref name="verybestofenya-nicky">{{Cite AV media notes|first=Nicky|last=Ryan|title=The Very Best of Enya (Collector's Edition)|year=2009|type=CD booklet notes ("It's Been a Long Time"|publisher=Warner Music|id=825646850051}}</ref><ref name=musician1989>{{Cite journal|journal=Musician |date=May 1989 |title=Enya: Clannad's Little Sister Sails Away |first=Michael |last=Azerrad |url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-25.htm |access-date=3 January 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304092646/http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-25.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> In 1980, after her year at college, Enya decided against pursuing music at university and accepted Ryan's invitation to join the group as he wanted to expand their sound with an additional vocalist and introducing keyboards.<ref name="verybestofenya-nicky"/><ref name=hotpress2016/> Enya performed an uncredited role their sixth studio album, ''[[Crann Úll]]'' (1980), with a line-up of siblings [[Máire Brennan|Máire]], [[Pól Brennan|Pól]], and [[Ciarán Brennan]], and twin uncles [[Noel Duggan|Noel]] and [[Pádraig Duggan]]. She became an official member by the time their follow-up, ''[[Fuaim]]'' (1981), was released, and is photographed with the band on the front cover.<ref name=billboard25Nov95>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pw0EAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA5|title=Enya: 'Memory,' Myth & Mythology|first=Timothy|last=White|date=25 November 1995|journal=Billboard|page=5|access-date=24 June 2016}}</ref> Nicky maintained it was never his intention to make Enya a permanent member, and saw she was "fiercely independent ... intent on playing her own music. She was just not sure of how to go about it". This sparked discussions between the two on layering vocal tracks to create a "choir of one", a concept inspired by the [[Wall of Sound]] technique by producer [[Phil Spector]] that interested them both.<ref name="verybestofenya-nicky"/>

During a Clannad tour in 1982, Nicky called for a band meeting to address internal issues that had arisen. He added, "It was short and only required a vote, I was a minority of one and lost. Roma and I were out. This left the question of what happened with Enya. I decided to stand back and say nothing".<ref name="verybestofenya-nicky"/> Enya chose to leave with the Ryans and pursue a solo career as she felt confined in the group, and disliked being "somebody in the background". This caused some friction between the two parties at first, but they settled their differences.<ref name=musician1989/> Nicky suggested to Enya that either she return to Gweedore "with no particular definite future", or live with him and Roma in [[Artane, Dublin]] "and see what happens, musically", which she accepted.<ref name=hotpress1987/> After their bank denied them a loan, Enya sold her saxophone and gave piano lessons for income and the Ryans used what they could afford from their savings to build a recording facility in a shed in their garden. They named it Aigle Studio, after the French word for "eagle",<ref name=hotpress2016/><ref name="verybestofenya-nicky"/> and rented it out to musicians to help recoup the costs.<ref name=londontimes2005>{{cite web|url=http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/amaran_16.htm|work=The London Times|title=The invisible star|first=Nigel|last=Williamson|date=10 December 2005|access-date=8 February 2017}}</ref> The trio formed a musical partnership, with Nicky as Enya's producer and arranger and Roma her lyricist,<ref name=musician1989/> and established their music company, Aigle Music.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://companycheck.co.uk/company/IE085184/AIGLE-MUSIC-COMPANY-LIMITED/companies-house-data|title=Aigle Music Company Limited|publisher=Company Check|access-date=25 February 2017}}</ref> In the following two years, Enya developed her technique and composition by listening to recordings of her reciting pieces of classical music, and repeated the process until she started to improvise sections and develop her own arrangements.<ref name=geffenpress1989>{{Cite news|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-32.htm |title=Watermark press release issued by Geffen Records |publisher=Geffen Records (USA) |date=January 1989 |access-date=22 March 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304102850/http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-32.htm |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}</ref> Her first composition was "An Taibhse Uaighneach", Irish for "The Lonely Ghost".<ref name="verybestofenya-nicky"/> During this time Enya played the synthesiser on ''[[Ceol Aduaidh]]'' (1983) by [[Mairéad Ní Mhaonaigh]] and [[Frankie Kennedy]],<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Ceol Aduaidh|year=1983|publisher=Gael-Linn Records|id=CEF 102}}</ref> and performed with the duo and Mhaonaigh's brother Gearóid in their short lived group, Ragairne.

Enya's first solo endeavour arrived in 1983 when she recorded two piano instrumentals, "An Ghaoth Ón Ghrian", Irish for "The Solar Wind", and "Miss Clare Remembers", at [[Windmill Lane Studios]] in Dublin which were released on ''Touch Travel'' (1984), a limited release cassette of music from various artists on the Touch label.

Among them was [[David Puttnam]], who liked the tape and offered Enya to compose [[The Frog Prince (album)|the soundtrack]] to his upcoming romantic comedy film, ''[[The Frog Prince (1984 film)|The Frog Prince]]'' (1984).<ref name=hotpress1987/> Enya scored nine pieces for the film but they were later rearranged and orchestrated against her wishes by Richard Myhill, except for two that she sang on, "The Frog Prince" and "Dreams"; the words to the latter were penned by [[Charlie McGettigan]].<ref name=frogprince/> Film editor [[Jim Clark (film editor)|Jim Clark]] said the rearrangements were necessary as Enya found it difficult to compose to picture.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=190}} Released in 1985, the album is the first commercial release that credits her as Enya,<ref name=frogprince>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Frog Prince: The Original Movie Soundtrack|publisher=Island Visual Arts|year=1985|id=ISTA 10}}</ref> after Nicky Ryan thought "Eithne" would be too difficult for non-Irish people to pronounce correctly and suggested the phonetic spelling of her name.<ref name=hotpress2016>{{cite web|url=http://www.hotpress.com/Enya/music/interviews/An-Interview-With-Enya-She-Moves-In-Mysterious-Ways/16620990.html|title=An Interview With Enya: She Moves in Mysterious Ways|first=Niall|last=Stokes|work=Hot Press|date=25 January 2016|access-date=13 February 2017}}</ref> Enya looked back on the film as a good career move, but a disappointing one as "we weren't part of it at the end".<ref name=tracks1989>{{Cite journal|title=The Country Girl|journal=Tracks|first=Max|last=Bell|date=January 1989|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-16.htm|access-date=3 January 2016}}</ref><ref name=hotpress1987/> She then sang on three tracks on ''[[Ordinary Man (Christy Moore album)|Ordinary Man]]'' (1985) by [[Christy Moore]].<ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Ordinary Man|year=1985|publisher=WEA|id=IR 0763}}</ref>

=== 1985–1989: ''The Celts'' and ''Watermark'' ===
In 1985, producer [[Tony McAuley]] asked Enya to contribute a track for a six-part BBC television documentary series ''[[The Celts (BBC documentary)|The Celts]]''.<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ByQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT4|title=...Newsline...

Each episode was to feature a different composer at first, but director David Richardson liked her track so much, he had Enya score the entire series.<ref name=geffenpress1989/><ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/adwr-17.htm|title=On Her Shoe: An Exclusive Interview with Enya|date=January 2001|journal=Inside Borders|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref> Enya recorded 72 minutes of music at Aigle Studio and the BBC studios in [[Wood Lane]], London without recording to picture, though she was required to portray certain themes and ideas that the producers wanted. Unlike ''The Frog Prince'', she worked with little interference which granted her freedom to establish her sound<ref name=tracks1989/> that she would adopt throughout her future career, signified by layered vocals, keyboard-oriented music, and percussion with elements of Celtic, classical, church and folk music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.warnermusic.com.au/enya |publisher=Warner Music Australia |title=Enya |access-date=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703130406/http://www.warnermusic.com.au/enya |archive-date=3 July 2009 }}</ref>

In March 1987, two months before ''The Celts'' aired, a 40-minute selection of Enya's score was released as her debut solo album, ''[[Enya (album)|Enya]]'', by [[BBC Records]] in the United Kingdom<ref name=hotpress1987/> and by [[Atlantic Records]] in the United States. The latter promoted it with a [[New-age music|new-age]] imprint on the packaging, which Nicky later thought was "a cowardly thing for them to do".<ref name=sundaychronicle1989/> The album gained enough public attention to reach number 8 on the [[Irish Albums Chart]] and number 69 on the [[UK Albums Chart]].<ref name=UKchart>{{Cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/29512/enya/ |title=Official Charts: Enya |publisher=Official Charts |access-date=3 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713144026/http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/29512/enya/ |archive-date=13 July 2016 }}</ref> "I Want Tomorrow" was released as Enya's first single.<ref name=hotpress1987>{{Cite journal|title=Enya: The Latest Score|first=Bill|last=Graham|year=1987|journal=Hot Press|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-1.htm}}</ref> "Boadicea" was sampled by [[The Fugees]] on their 1996 song "[[Ready or Not (Fugees song)|Ready or Not]]"; the group neither sought permission nor gave credit, and Enya took legal action. The group subsequently gave her credit and paid a fee worth around $3&nbsp;million. Later in 1987, Enya appeared on [[Sinéad O'Connor]]'s debut album ''[[The Lion and the Cobra]]'', reciting Psalm 91 in Irish on "Never Get Old".<ref name=hotpress1988>{{Cite journal|title=Growing With the Flow|first=Niall|last=Stokes|date=1 December 1988|journal=Hot Press|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-5.htm}}</ref>

Several weeks after the release of ''Enya'', Enya secured a recording contract with [[Warner Music Group|Warner Music UK]] after [[Rob Dickins]], the label's chairman and a fan of Clannad, took a liking to ''Enya'' and found himself playing it "every night before I went to bed".<ref name=hotpressoctober1988>{{Cite journal|journal=Hot Press|date=6 October 1988|title=Going with the Flow|first=Niall|last=Stokes|access-date=1 January 2016|url=http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-2.htm}}</ref> He then met Enya and the Ryans at a chance meeting at the [[Irish Recorded Music Association]] award ceremony in Dublin, and learned Enya had entered negotiations with a rival label. Dickins seized the opportunity and signed her to Warner Music with a deal worth £75,000,{{cn|date=September 2020}} granting her wish to write and record with artistic freedom, minimal interference from the label, and without set deadlines to finish albums.<ref name=sundaychronicle1989>{{Cite news|title=Interview with Enya|first=Tom|last=Lanham|newspaper=The Sunday Chronicle|year=1989|url=http://enyabookofdays.com/articles/wm-12.htm}}</ref><ref name=orangecoast1992>{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9BEEAAAAMBAJ&q=enya+shepherd+moons&pg=PA120|journal=Orange Coast|title=The Transcendent Sounds of Enya|date=March 1992|first=Keith|last=Tuber|pages=120, 122|access-date=1 January 2016}}</ref> Dickins said: "Sometimes you sign an act to make money, and sometimes you sign an act to make music.

After travelling worldwide to promote ''Shepherd Moons'', Enya started to write and record her fourth album, ''[[The Memory of Trees]]''. The album was released in November 1995. It peaked at number five in the United Kingdom<ref name=UKchart/> and number nine in the United States,<ref name=USalbumchart/> where it sold over 3 million copies.

In early 1997, Enya began to select tracks for her first compilation album, "trying to select the obvious ones, the hits, and others."<ref name=dailynews1997/> She chose to work on the collection following the promotional tour for ''The Memory of Trees'' as she felt it was the right time in her career, and that her contract with WEA required her to release a "best of" album.

=== 1998–2007: ''A Day Without Rain'' and ''Amarantine'' ===
Enya started work on her fifth studio album, titled ''[[A Day Without Rain]]'', in mid-1998. In a departure from her previous albums she incorporated the use of a [[string section]] into her compositions, something that was not a conscious decision at first, but Enya and Nicky Ryan agreed it complemented the songs that were being written. The album was released in November 2000, and reached number 6 in the United Kingdom<ref name=UKchart/> and an initial peak of number 17 in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/billboard-200/2000-12-16|title=Billboard 200 for the week of December 16, 2000|work=Billboard|access-date=19 March 2016}}</ref> In the aftermath of the [[September 11 attacks|11 September attacks]], sales of the album and its lead single, "[[Only Time]]", surged after the song was widely used during radio and television coverage of the events,<ref name=VH12001/> leading to its description as "a post-September 11 anthem".<ref name=billboard2005>{{Cite journal|journal=Billboard|title=Enya Expands Lyrical Language|date=21 November 2005|access-date=5 January 2016|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/amaran_13.htm}}</ref> The exposure caused ''A Day Without Rain'' to outperform its original chart performance to peak at number 2 on the ''Billboard'' 200,<ref name=VH12001/> and the release of a [[maxi single]] containing the original and a pop remix of "Only Time" in November 2001. Enya donated its proceeds in aid of the [[International Association of Firefighters]].

Enya undertook additional studio projects in 2001 and 2002. The first was work on the soundtrack to the Japanese romantic film ''[[Calmi Cuori Appassionati]]'' (2001) which was subsequently released as ''[[Themes from Calmi Cuori Appassionati]]'' (2001). The album is formed of tracks spanning her career from ''Enya'' to ''A Day Without Rain'' with two B-sides.

In September 2003, Enya returned to Aigle Studio to start work on her sixth studio album, ''[[Amarantine (album)|Amarantine]]''.{{sfn|Ryan|2005|p=Foreword}} Roma said the title means "everlasting".<ref name=billboard2005/> The album marks the first instance of Enya singing in [[Loxian]], a fictional language created by Roma that came about when Enya was working on "Water Shows the Hidden Heart". After numerous attempts to sing the song in English, Irish and Latin, Roma suggested a new language based on some of the sounds Enya would sing along to when developing her songs. It was a success, and Enya sang "Less Than a Pearl" and "The River Sings" in the same way. Roma worked on the language further, creating a "culture and history" behind it surrounding the Loxian people who are of another planet, questioning the existence of life on another.<ref name=billboard2005/> "Sumiregusa (Wild Violet)" is sung in Japanese.<ref name=billboard2005/> ''Amarantine'' was a global success, reaching number 6 on the ''Billboard'' 200<ref name=USalbumchart/> and number 8 in the UK.<ref name=UKchart/> It has sold over 1 million certified copies in the US, a considerable drop in sales in comparison to her previous albums.

=== 2008–present: ''And Winter Came...'', ''Dark Sky Island'', and future ===
Enya continued to write music with a winter and Christmas theme for her seventh studio album, ''[[And Winter Came...]]''. Initially she intended to make an album of seasonal songs and hymns set for a release in late 2007, but decided to produce a winter-themed album instead. The track "My! My! Time Flies!", a tribute to the late Irish guitarist [[Jimmy Faulkner]], incorporates a guitar solo performed by Pat Farrell,<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/awc-15.htm|journal=Hot Press|date=5 November 2008|first=Evan|last=Fanning|title=Ethereal Girl|access-date=20 March 2016}}</ref> the first use of a guitar on an Enya album since "I Want Tomorrow" from ''Enya''.

After promoting ''And Winter Came...'', Enya took an extended break from writing and recording music. She spent her time resting, visiting family in Australia, and renovating her new home in the south of France. In March 2009, her first four studio albums were reissued in Japan in the Super High Material CD format with bonus tracks.<ref name=watermark2009>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Watermark|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13298}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Celts|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13297}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=Shepherd Moons|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13299}}</ref><ref>{{Cite AV media notes|title=The Memory of Trees|publisher=WEA Japan|year=2009|id=WPCR-13300}}</ref> Her second compilation album, ''[[The Very Best of Enya]]'', was released in November 2009 and features songs from 1987 to 2008, including a previously unreleased version of "Aníron" and a DVD compiling most of her music videos to date.

Numerous critics and reviewers classify Enya's albums as [[New-age music|new age music]] and she has won four Grammy Awards in the category. However, Enya does not classify her music as part of the genre. When asked what genre she would classify her music, her reply was "Enya".<ref name = Enyafaq/> Nicky Ryan commented on the new age comments: "Initially it was fine, but it's really not new age. Enya plays a whole lot of instruments, not just keyboards. Her melodies are strong and she sings a lot.

[[File:Enya logo.svg|thumb|left|Enya's logotype, first used in 1988 on the front cover of ''Watermark'']]
Enya has sung in ten languages in her career, including English, Irish, Latin, Welsh, Spanish, French and Japanese.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldmusic.about.com/od/bandsartistsaz/p/Enya.htm |title=Enya Profile – Celtic New Age Music Star Enya |publisher=Worldmusic.about.com |date=17 May 1961 |access-date=14 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713094248/http://worldmusic.about.com/od/bandsartistsaz/p/Enya.htm |archive-date=13 July 2009 }}</ref> She has recorded music influenced by works from fantasy author [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], including the instrumental "Lothlórien" from ''Shepherd Moons''. For ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', she sang "[[May It Be]]" in English and Tolkien's fictional language [[Quenya]], and sang "[[Aníron]]" in another of Tolkien's fictional languages, [[Sindarin]]. Her albums ''Amarantine'' and ''Dark Sky Island'' include songs sung in [[Loxian]], a fictional language created by Roma, that has no official [[syntax]]. Its vocabulary was formed by Enya singing the song's notes to which Roma wrote their phonetic spelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/amarantine.php#loxian |title=Loxian – Amarantine album |publisher=Enya.sk |access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref>

Enya adopted a composing and songwriting method that has deviated little throughout her career. At the start of the recording process for an album she enters the studio, forgetting about her previous success, fame, and songs of hers that became hits. "If I did that", she said, "I'd have to call it a day".<ref name=guardian2000>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/nov/20/artsfeatures2|title=Interview: Enya – Queen of the castle|work=The Guardian|first=John|last=Aizlewood|date=20 November 2000|access-date=29 December 2016}}</ref> She then develops ideas on the piano, keeping note of any arrangement that can be worked on further. During her time writing, Enya works a five-day week, takes weekends off, and does not work on her music at home.<ref name=elainepage2008>{{cite episode|first=Elaine (host)|last=Page|series=Elaine Page on Sunday|station=BBC Radio 2|date=23 November 2008|time=16:39–17:58}}</ref> With Irish as her first language, Enya initially records her songs in Irish as she can express "feeling much more directly" than English.<ref name=spin1989>{{cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Yh9p0GCKsEC&pg=PA9|title=Above the Watermark|first=Jim|last=Fouratt|journal=SPIN|date=May 1989|page=9|issn=0886-3032|access-date=31 December 2016}}</ref> After a period of time, Enya presents her ideas to Nicky to discuss what pieces work best, while Roma works in parallel to devise a lyric to the songs. Enya considered "Fallen Embers" from ''A Day Without Rain'' a perfect time when the lyrics reflect as to how she felt while writing the song.<ref name=guardian2000/> In 2008, she newly discovered her tendency to write "two or three songs" during the winter months, work on the arrangements and lyrics the following spring and summer, and then work on the next couple of songs when autumn arrives.<ref name=elainepage2008/>

== Live performances ==
Enya says that Warner Music and she "did not see eye to eye" initially as the label imagined her performing on stage "with a piano ... maybe two or three synthesiser players and that's it".<ref name=hotpress2016/> Enya also explained that the time put into her studio albums causes her to "run overtime", leaving little time to plan for other such projects.<ref name=enyabookofdays1997/> She also expressed the difficulty in recreating her studio-oriented sound for the stage. In 1996, Ryan said Enya had received an offer worth almost £500,000 to perform a concert in Japan.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/tmot-7.htm|title=The Musical Irish, from Oasis to Enya|first=Luke|last=Clancy|journal=[[World of Hibernia]]|year=1996|access-date=22 June 2016}}</ref> In 2016, Enya spoke about the prospect of a live concert when she revealed talks with the Ryans during her three-year break after ''And Winter Came...'' (2008) to perform a show at the [[Metropolitan Opera House (Lincoln Center)|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City that would be [[simulcast]] to cinemas worldwide. Before such an event could happen, Nicky suggested that she enter a studio and record "all the hits" live with an orchestra and choir to see how they would sound.<ref name=hotpress2016/>

Enya has sung with live and [[Lip sync#Lip synching in music|lip synching]] vocals on various talk and music shows, events, and ceremonies throughout her career, usually during her worldwide press tours for each album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enya.sk/articles-archive/enya-set-for-return-to-limelight-with-album-and-tour |title=Enya set for return to limelight with album and tour |date=25 June 2012 |publisher=Enya.sk |access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref> In December 1995, she performed "[[Anywhere Is]]" at a Christmas concert at Vatican City with [[Pope John Paul II]] in attendance, who met and thanked her for performing.<ref name=enyabookofdays1997/> In April 1996, Enya performed the same song during her surprise appearance at the fiftieth birthday celebration for [[Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden|Carl XVI Gustaf]], the King of Sweden and a fan of Enya's.<ref name=dailynews1997>{{Cite news|title=Enya Knocks on Heaven's Doors|first=Jim|last=Sullivan|work=Los Angeles Daily News|date=20 December 1997|access-date=6 January 2015|url=http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/ptsws-12.htm}}</ref> In 1997, Enya participated in a live Christmas Eve broadcast in London and flew to County Donegal afterwards to join her family for their annual [[midnight Mass]] choral performance,<ref name=enyabookofdays1997>{{cite news | first = Jim | last = Sullivan | title = Enya Knocks on Heaven's Doors | date = 20 December 1997| url = http://www.enyabookofdays.com/articles/ptsws-12.htm | work = Boston Globe | access-date =29 December 2010}}</ref> in which she participates each year.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Anita|last=Guidera|title =Donegal Catch as Proud Parents of Folk Music's First Family Get Freedom of County|date=15 July 2005|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/donegal-catch-as-proud-parents-of-folk-musics-first-family-get-freedom-of-county-249795.html|work=Irish Independent|access-date=29 December 2010}}</ref> In March 2002, she performed "[[May It Be]]" with an orchestra at the year's [[Academy Award]]s ceremony.

==Personal life==
[[File:Enya Castle.jpg|right|thumb|Enya's home in [[Killiney]], County Dublin]]
Since the 1980s, Enya has attracted the attention of several [[stalkers]]. In 1996, an Italian man who was seen in Dublin wearing a photograph of Enya around his neck stabbed himself outside her parents' pub after being ejected from the premises.<ref>{{cite news|last=McKittrick|first=David|date=5 October 2005|title=Enya escapes intruder by hiding in panic room|work=The Independent|location=London|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/enya-escapes-intruder-by-hiding-in-panic-room-317211.html|access-date=14 August 2009}}</ref>
