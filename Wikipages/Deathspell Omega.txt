'''Deathspell Omega''' is a French [[black metal]] band formed in 1998 in [[Poitiers]]. Their lyrical content deals primarily with [[Satanism]] on a [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] level – as the band has stated that "all other interpretations of Satan are intellectually invalid"<ref name="ajna">{{cite web |url=http://ezxhaton.kccricket.net/interview.html |title=Interview with Deathspell Omega |work=Kccricket.net |access-date=15 May 2011}}</ref> – and other various theological topics. They have also released a trilogy of concept albums which focus on the theological aspects of God, [[Satan]] and man's relationship with the two. They released their sixth album, ''The Synarchy of Molten Bones'', on 8 November 2016<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/deathspell-omega-the-synarchy-of-molten-bones-ep/|title=Deathspell Omega to Release 'The Synarchy of Molten Bones'|website=Loudwire|access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref> and their seventh, ''The Furnaces of Palingenesia'', on 24 May 2019;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.noevdia.com/2019-05-03-deathspell-omega-the-furnaces-of-palingenesia-cd-lp-to-be-released-on-may-24th-2019/ |title=The Furnaces of Palingenesia to be released on May 24, 2019|website=NoEvDia}}</ref> the last of these reflects a shift in lyrical focus to anti-authoritarian political themes. Some of their lyrical inspiration has also revolved around [[existentialist]] themes coming from the French [[Surrealism|surrealist]] [[Georges Bataille]],<ref name="ajna"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-971_is_black_metal_coming_of_age.aspx |title=Is Black Metal Coming of Age? |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |date=18 December 2006 |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref> whom the band has cited several times as their largest literary influence, as well as the German idealist [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/features/inquiry-history-and-evolution-metaphysical-satanism-black-metal |title=An Inquiry into the History and Evolution of Metaphysical Satanism in Black Metal |work=Tiny Mix Tapes|access-date=20 January 2015}}</ref>

== Biography ==
Initially, Deathspell Omega produced raw, traditional black metal akin to [[Darkthrone]]'s ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]''. However, their 2004 release, ''[[Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice]]'', marked a change to a vastly more technical, experimental, and well-recorded sound featuring such musical influences as [[Russian Orthodox]] chanting and [[choral music]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/deathspell-omega-mn0000403408/biography|title=Deathspell Omega {{!}} Biography & History {{!}} AllMusic|website=AllMusic|access-date=1 November 2016}}</ref>

The band's work after ''Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice'' has been even more experimental and technical, with their output in 2005—''[[Kénôse]]'', "Mass Grave Aesthetics" and "Diabolus absconditus"—totaling nearly eighty minutes in length, longer than ''Si monvmentvm reqvires, circvmspice''. The second volume of the band's trilogy, ''[[Fas – Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum]]'', was released on 16 July 2007, outside the United States, and the following day within the United States, to considerable acclaim.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=fas-ite-maledicti-in-ignem-aeternum-mw0000489273|pure_url=yes}} |title=Fas – Ite, Maledicti, in Ignem Aeternum |website=AllMusic |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://pitchfork.com/features/show-no-mercy/6738-show-no-mercy/ |title=No.&nbsp;2 on Brandon Stosuy's Best of 2007 |department=Show No Mercy |work=Pitchfork Media |date=28 November 2007 |access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref> The band released another EP in January 2009, entitled ''[[Veritas Diaboli Manet in Aeternum: Chaining the Katechon]]''.

There is little to no concrete information about Deathspell Omega's lineup—they do not have any official website, social media platform or promotional photos, have never performed live and do not list credits in their releases. Finnish musician [[Clandestine Blaze|Mikko Aspa]] is most commonly cited as the vocalist.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://heathenharvest.org/2016/01/02/outcast-by-choice-an-interview-with-mikko-aspa/|title=Outcast by Choice; an Interview with Mikko Aspa – Heathen Harvest|date=2 January 2016|work=Heathen Harvest|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="Interview with Deathspell Omega">{{Cite web|url=http://ezxhaton.kccricket.net/interview.html|title=Interview with Deathspell Omega|website=ezxhaton.kccricket.net|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref> It is known that Hirilorn vocalist Shaxul was Deathspell Omega's vocalist until 2002, and has gone on record as leaving due to displeasure with the band's shift in themes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reanimatormetal.proboards.com/thread/979|title=Interesting interview with Shaxul (ex-DsO) {{!}} Reanimator|website=reanimatormetal.proboards.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref> Early interviews were deeply critical of the black metal scene,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_m509HcASqKc/Sza6nj8WCkI/AAAAAAAAAIE/Cbd5Ckbe-4A/s1600-h/northern+heritage+bm+-zine2-03.jpg|title=northern+heritage+bm+-zine2-03.jpg (image)|website=1.bp.blogspot.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_m509HcASqKc/Sza6xjhpa5I/AAAAAAAAAIM/s-8pZPnycv8/s1600-h/northern+heritage+bm+-zine2-04.jpg|title=northern+heritage+bm+-zine2-04.jpg (image)|website=4.bp.blogspot.com|access-date=2 January 2018}}</ref> and the last interview they agreed to until 2019 was conducted by their North American label [[The Ajna Offensive]], with questions and answers sent through the band's exclusive label, Norma Evangelium Diaboli, to preserve their identity.<ref name="Interview with Deathspell Omega"/> In a 2018 interview with Loudwire, [[Tobias Forge]], lead singer of the band [[Ghost (Swedish band)|Ghost]], stated that the French synthwave artist [[Carpenter Brut]] (Franck Hueso) was Deathspell Omega's producer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://loudwire.com/tobias-forge-ghost-iron-maiden-influence/|title=Tobias Forge: How Iron Maiden Influenced Ghost|work=Loudwire|access-date=5 September 2018}}</ref>

The band's seventh full-length album, ''The Furnaces of Palingenesia'', was released on May 24, 2019, and reflects a shift in lyrical focus for the band. The album is presented as a manifesto from an authoritarian dictator speaking for a political faction referred to as "the Order"; it is explicitly intended to deconstruct authoritarian regimes of both the left and the right.<ref name="bardo">{{cite web |url=http://www.bardomethodology.com/articles/2019/06/23/deathspell-omega-interview/ |title=Deathspell Omega interview - Bardo Methodology |access-date=June 30, 2019 |website=Bardo Methodology |author=Göransson, Niklas |date=June 23, 2019}}</ref> The band recorded the album live in a studio using analogue gear, and it was mastered more quietly than most of the band's preceding material, also reflecting a shift in production approach. A month later, the band conducted its first interview in fifteen years with Niklas Göransson of the website Bardo Methodology,<ref name="bardo"/> during which they discussed the album's themes in detail. The band discussed a major impetus for the interview and the album being the [[Doomsday Clock]] being at two minutes to midnight, citing concerns over the degradation of the natural environment and the growing presence of authoritarian politics. They referenced Maximillien Aue, the villainous narrator of [[Jonathan Littell]]'s novel ''[[The Kindly Ones (Littell novel)|The Kindly Ones]]'', in discussing the narration style of the album, contrasting his perspective with [[Winston Smith (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Winston Smith]]'s from [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four (novel)|Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''. They compared their politics to those of their largest literary inspiration, [[Georges Bataille]], noting that Bataille opposed both the authoritarianism of the left from the Soviet Union and the authoritarianism of the right from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.

The band noted that a major purpose of ''The Furnaces of Palingenesia'' was to "shatter a myth that’s so central to stability both on an individual and civilisational level: the impervious necessity to believe that what we do is just, that we are just, that good and evil in intent and deed are as distinct as night and day." They also argued:

:: Twice, man committed the highest of crimes: by waging an absolutist war against nature and, therefore, against life itself. And, secondly, by severing the bond to nature and forging an anthropocentric worldview that places man above everything else and, therefore, can be used to justify just about anything – no matter how short-sighted or ill-advised – so long as it appears to serve mankind’s interests. Extracting man from the natural order, by intent if not in effect, was a sign of hubris which remains literally without equivalent and whose resulting devastations will know no equivalent either. Listen carefully enough and you’ll hear demonic snigger.

Without naming any of their members directly, the band also confirmed suspicions of an ideological rift within the band, noting, "A minority of the collective’s contributors – shall we say, parts of the second circle – who’ve been invited to partake because of their incredible talents as musicians are involved with earthly politics, but stand on completely opposite ends of the political spectrum and are therefore irreconcilable political foes." However, they noted that the music and lyrics were authored by the "French core of the collective". This clarification was made in the wake of backlash against Deathspell Omega due to their long time collaboration with Mikko Aspa who has long been accused of having connections and links with various [[National Socialist black metal|NSBM]] acts from a myriad of European metal scenes.
