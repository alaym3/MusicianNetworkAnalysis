'''Marc Rebillet''' ({{IPA-fr|ʁəbijɛ}}; born December 15, 1988) is an American [[electronic music]]ian and [[YouTuber]] from [[Dallas]], [[Texas]], currently based in [[New York City]]. He is known for improvising electronic songs that feature comical lyrics.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/stage/is-marc-rebillet-the-funniest-man-on-the-planet-right-now-1.3761456|title=Is Marc Rebillet the funniest man on the planet right now?|last=O'Reilly|first=Seamas|date=January 22, 2019|website=The Irish Times|language=en|access-date=July 2, 2019}}</ref> Rebillet primarily distributes his work through [[YouTube]] [[video]]s and [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]] [[Live streaming|live streams]] in which he uses a loop station, keyboard, vocals and percussion instruments to produce his songs in his apartment. He also has released three studio albums (''Marc Rebillet'', ''Europe'' and ''Loop Daddy III'') and two [[Extended play|extended play records]] (''Loop Daddy'' and ''Loop Daddy II'').

== Early life ==
Rebillet's father was [[French people|French]] and his mother is from [[South Carolina]]. His parents met in [[Paris]]. Rebillet started playing piano at age four; he studied classical music until age 15 while attending [[Booker T. Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts]] in Dallas.

In 2007, Rebillet first went [[Viral video|viral]] after being interviewed on [[KDFW|Fox 4]] in Dallas while lining up to be first to buy an [[iPhone]] during its initial release. A woman paid Rebillet $800 for his spot in the front of the line, attempting to buy many phones to resell. The plan backfired because of the store's policy that only allowed one iPhone per customer. The video of the encounter received 4 million views.<ref>{{Cite web|date=February 2, 2009|title=Woman's plan to get rich quick blows up in her face.|url=https://www.wimp.com/womans-plan-to-get-rich-quick-blows-up-in-her-face/|website=Wimp.com}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite web|last=Perkins|first=Nichole|date=2021-08-17|title=They Call Him Loop Daddy|url=https://www.vulture.com/article/marc-rebillet-third-dose.html|access-date=2021-08-22|website=Vulture|language=en-us}}</ref>

Rebillet dropped out of [[Southern Methodist University]] after one year of studying acting. Rebillet then worked in other sectors for ten years, including as a server, an executive assistant, and in a corporate [[Call centre|call center]], while producing music unsuccessfully under the name "Leae". During this time, Rebillet moved to New York City in 2011 and back to Dallas in 2014 to care for his father, who had [[Alzheimer's disease]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.dublinlive.ie/whats-on/music-nightlife-news/marc-rebillet-interview-beatyard-viral-16684308|title=Viral sensation Marc Rebillet on touring the world with his "insane" new job|last=Jones|first=Christopher|date=August 1, 2019|website=DublinLive|access-date=August 5, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://www.centraltrack.com/qa-marc-rebillet-is-wildin-his-way-to-the-top/|title=[Q&A] Marc Rebillet Is Wildin' His Way To The Top.|last=Freedman|first=Pete|date=September 18, 2019|website=Central Track|language=en-US|access-date=September 21, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":9" />

In 2016, Rebillet claimed on Reddit to have discovered an alleged unreleased 1998 [[Sufjan Stevens]] album in a dumpster outside record label [[Asthmatic Kitty]]'s studios in [[Dumbo, Brooklyn]] in 2014. A representative from the label who responded to the post was unable to confirm the album's authenticity, but requested that Rebillet not share it. A few hours later, Rebillet proceeded to upload the album and share it on [[4chan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://diymag.com/2016/07/08/sufjan-stevens-album-stalker-reddit-bin|title=A Reddit user found an unreleased Sufjan Stevens album called "Stalker" in a bin|date=July 8, 2016|website=diymag.com}}</ref> In an interview with [[Stereogum]] the next day, he expressed regret for disrespecting the label's wishes, but stated he wanted to let the album be preserved online. When asked if the album was possibly a hoax, Rebillet responded, "I have neither the time nor the desire to prove its authenticity."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stereogum.com/1886632/an-interview-with-the-guy-who-says-he-found-an-unreleased-album-in-sufjan-stevens-dumpster/franchises/interview/|title=An Interview With The Guy Who Says He Found An Unreleased Album In Sufjan Stevens’ Dumpster|date=July 7, 2016|website=Stereogum.com}}</ref>

=== Live performances ===
[[File:Marc Rebillet Beatyard.jpg|thumb|Rebillet performing in Dublin in 2019]]
His first live shows took place in 2017 in bars in his native Dallas, Texas.<ref name=":2" /> He subsequently moved to New York to further develop his music career. Describing how his online presence quickly increased his fanbase, Rebillet told an interviewer:<blockquote>It happened very, very quickly...the whole online thing just took off in this very aggressive way. Like, people around the world just started sharing my stuff on Facebook primarily, and my audience on Facebook went from 7,000 or 10,000 followers to, within a week or two, 50,000. Then it was 100,000. And it just kept climbing! And with that spike came all of these booking requests from all over the world that I really had no clue how to deal with or what to do with.<ref name=":3" /></blockquote>

Starting in 2019, Rebillet has performed on tours in the United States and Europe, and ticket sales have become his primary source of revenue.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dallasobserver.com/music/dallas-dj-marc-rebillets-homegrown-homecoming-11637969|title=Electronic Provocateur Marc Rebillet Returns Home to Dallas With an International Following|last=Hicks|first=Tyler|date=April 12, 2019|website=Dallas Observer|access-date=July 2, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21185220/tours-canceled-musicians-marc-rebillet-twitch-livestreaming-coronavirus|title=Tours are canceled, so musicians are turning to Twitch|last=Deahl|first=Dani|date=March 19, 2020|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref> Rebillet's live shows are energetic, interactive, and almost entirely [[Musical improvisation|improvised]], with very little material being repeated from show to show. Explaining his approach to performance, Rebillet said, "I think up a couple of ideas, make some observations through the day, think of something that’s germane to the crowd I’m playing to, I use those things as seedlings for song ideas."<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://dublingazette.com/whats-on/entertainment/marc-rebillet-the-funnyman-with-serious-side-balanced-by-brilliance-47628/|title=Marc Rebillet: The funnyman with a serious side, balanced by brilliance|last=Hendicott|first=James|date=July 25, 2019|website=Dublin Gazette|language=en-GB|access-date=July 26, 2019}}</ref> The Dublin Gazette called Rebillet "a man who’s thoughtful far beyond his output.

In 2021, Rebillet embarked on the "Third Dose" tour, which included major American music festivals, such as [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo]], [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] and [[Lollapalooza]].<ref name=":9" />

=== Drive-In Concert Tour ===
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, in which all concerts were cancelled, Rebillet scheduled a "drive-in concert tour" in June 2020, in which he performed at twelve shows at eight [[drive-in theater]]s in the United States while attendees watch from their cars and listen over a local radio frequency.<ref>{{Cite web|title=List of Drive-In Concerts in Wake of Coronavirus|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/concerts/9379646/drive-in-concerts-list-coronavirus|last=Rowley|first=Glenn|date=May 19, 2020|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Borba|first=Ryan|date=June 3, 2020|title=Marc Rebillet: The 'Loop Daddy' Improvises An Innovative Post-Corona Touring Model|url=https://www.pollstar.com/article/marc-rebillet-the-loop-daddy-improvises-an-innovative-post-corona-touring-model-144723|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=June 17, 2020|website=Pollstar}}</ref> The objective of these performances was to remain in compliance with social distancing regulations. In place of opening acts, short films were shown. Explaining how he planned to perform, Rebillet told ''[[CNN]]'', "Since everyone is going to be forced to be in their cars, I'll be able to do a lot of running around, 'interacting' with the audience, just by doing my thing."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Marc Rebillet, electronic dance artist, plots first known US tour at drive-in theaters|url=https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/07/entertainment/marc-rebillet-drive-in-tour-trnd/index.html|last=Ries|first=Brian|date=|website=CNN|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=May 22, 2020}}</ref> The tour was called the first of its kind in the United States, and was generally sold-out, grossing $523,000 with 12,132 attendees.

== Music ==
Rebillet's music is defined by his use of a [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] RC-505 [[Live looping|loop station]], which allows him to layer his voice with keyboards, [[tambourine]]s, and other [[hand percussion]] instruments. Most of his songs are improvised, and include elements of [[funk]], [[Soul music|soul]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], and [[House music|house]] music, as well as comedy [[Sketch comedy|skits]]. Nick Pagano described Rebillet's music as ranging "from soulful serenading piano ballads to funky bass licks to downright club bangers, and is always accompanied by his unique sense of humor".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pghcitypaper.com/pittsburgh/marc-rebillet-put-on-a-one-of-its-kind-performance-at-the-rex-theater/Content?oid=16015181|title=Marc Rebillet put on a one-of-its-kind performance at The Rex Theater|last=Pagano|first=Nick|date=October 14, 2019|website=Pittsburgh City Paper|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 27, 2019}}</ref> His lyrics tend to be comical, silly, or vulgar, enough so that he has been referred to as a comedian. Rebillet's "goofy", "nerdy", and "earnest" personality plays a role in his popularity.<ref name=":1" />

The apartment contains furniture by [[Ligne Roset]] and [[Pierre Paulin]], and art by [[Verner Panton]] and [[Jack Youngerman]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Olson|first=Carly|title=Musician Marc Rebillet’s Manhattan Apartment Is Sleek, Sexy, and a Little Nerdy|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/marc-rebillet-apartment-tour|access-date=2021-03-21|website=Architectural Digest|language=en-us}}</ref>
