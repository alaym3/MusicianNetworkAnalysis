'''Howard Earl Bailey Jr'''. (born March 9, 1980),<ref name="allmusic.com">{{cite web |url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p557199/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Chingy Biography |publisher= Jason Birchmeier |access-date=2008-09-16}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/chingyfulldekk/|title=Chingy (@chingyfulldekk) • Instagram photos and videos|website=Instagram.com}}</ref> known professionally as '''Chingy''', is an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] recording artist, record producer and actor. Chingy grew up in [[St. Louis]], Missouri and began rapping in his late teens. He toured as an opening act with [[Nelly]] in the summer of 2002 and then became a protégé of [[Ludacris]], who signed him to his newly formed [[Disturbing Tha Peace]] (DTP) record label. The rapper's 2003 summer debut single, "[[Right Thurr]]", put him on the musical map as a good-time rapper who specialized in catchy, club-friendly beats and simplistic lyrics delivered in a sing-song, nursery rhyme style.

Chingy's 2003 debut album, ''[[Jackpot (Chingy album)|Jackpot]]'', sold two million copies, thanks to the boost from "Right Thurr". A second album, ''[[Powerballin']]'', was released in 2004 to mixed reviews, and his 2006 release ''[[Hoodstar]]'' spawned the hit singles "[[Pullin' Me Back]]" (featuring [[Tyrese Gibson]]) and "[[Dem Jeans]]" (featuring [[Jermaine Dupri]]). In 2007, his fourth album, ''[[Hate It or Love It (album)|Hate It or Love It]]'' was released under Disturbing tha Peace, preceded by lead single "[[Fly Like Me]]" (featuring [[Amerie]]). A studio album, ''[[Success & Failure]]'', was released in 2010. In 2018, he made his official debut as a [[record producer]] with his single “Sparks Fly” which debuted on July 4, 2018.

==Early life==
Chingy grew up in Walnut Park, [[St. Louis, Missouri]], a neighborhood he has referred to as the "Bad Blocks."<ref name="defjam.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.defjam.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=671 |title=Chingy official website |publisher=defjam.com |access-date=2008-09-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080518081140/http://www.defjam.com/site/artist_bio.php?artist_id=671 |archive-date=2008-05-18 }}</ref><ref name="Shapiro">Shapiro, Peter (2005) ''The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', Rough Guides, {{ISBN|1-84353-263-8}}, p. 60</ref>

He began writing lyrics when he was 9 and was recording raps at 10. He was originally known as H Thugz and was in the St. Louis group Without Warning on 49 Productions with M.G.D. & Mysphit. They recorded "What's Poppin Off" together, which became a local hit. H Thugz and Augustin also recorded a music video for the song. H Thugz later chose the alias Chingy, a slang term for money.<ref name="FactMonster.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.factmonster.com/biography/var/chingy.html |title=Chingy Biography |publisher= FactMonster.com |access-date=2008-09-16}}</ref>

Chingy attended [[McCluer North High School]] in [[Florissant, Missouri]], a suburb of St. Louis. During high school, he was known to his friends as "Howie," and he continues to prefer that name from close friends and family.<ref name="Shapiro" />

==Music career==

===1997–2002: Early career===
[[Ludacris]] and his manager, Chaka Zulu, were quick to sign Chingy to their fledgling [[Disturbing Tha Peace]] label.

===2003–2005: ''Jackpot'' and ''Powerballin''===
Chingy's debut album ''[[Jackpot (Chingy album)|Jackpot]]'' was released on July 15, 2003, on Disturbing tha Peace. Unable to secure a distribution deal through [[Def Jam]], Ludacris negotiated a deal to distribute the album through [[Capitol Records]]. Guest appearances included Ludacris, [[Snoop Dogg]], [[Murphy Lee]], [[I-20 (rapper)|I-20]], Raindrop, [[2 Chainz|Tity Boi]] of [[Playaz Circle]], [[Trina]], and [[Jermaine Dupri]]. Fueled by "[[Right Thurr]]", ''Jackpot'' produced the hit "[[One Call Away (Chingy song)|One Call Away]]" featuring [[Jason Weaver|J-Weav]] and "[[Holidae In]]" featuring Snoop Dogg and Ludacris. The album was produced by St. Louis production crew [[The Trak Starz]]. The album was received well by critics. Within a year of the release of ''[[Jackpot (Chingy album)|Jackpot]]'', It was certified [[Music recording sales certification|Platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The up-tempo Southern hip hop track "[[Right Thurr]]" gained popularity, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].

Chingy released his second album, ''[[Powerballin']]'', on November 16, 2004, through Slot-A-Lot Records and Capitol Records. The album peaked at #10 on the charts and featured the hit single "[[Balla Baby]]." The album featured guest appearances from artists [[R. Kelly]], [[Bun B]], [[Lil Wayne]], [[Lil Flip]], [[Janet Jackson]], [[David Banner]], [[Nate Dogg]], and Get It Boyz. ''Powerballin''' sold over one million copies and received a Platinum certification by the RIAA on March 21, 2005. He also was on one of the George Lopez episodes as himself. The eighth song from his album "I Do" is featured on the soundtrack for the 2004 video game [[Need for Speed: Underground 2]].

===2006–2008: ''Hood Star'' and ''Hate It or Love It''===
''[[Hoodstar]]'' is Chingy's third album, released on September 19, 2006. The album featured [[Mr. Collipark]], longtime collaborator [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Timbaland]], and [[Mannie Fresh]]. His summer single, "[[Pullin Me Back]]" (featuring actor-R&B singer [[Tyrese Gibson|Tyrese]]), would find him back on top on the Hot Rap Tracks chart and help ''Hoodstar'' debut at number eight on the album chart, but the follow-up single "[[Dem Jeans]]", featuring Jermaine Dupri, fared worse although the album did go gold. Other singles from ''Hoodstar'' were "Brand New Kicks" and "Hands Up".

Unhappy with the way he felt Capitol was promoting their urban artists, in 2007 Chingy jumped ship and returned to DTP Records, which was by-then a part of the Def Jam family. When asked upon this move, the St. Louis rapper said: "I don't think Capitol really knew how to work urban artists, They're really stuck on pop and they didn't know how to market me."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/new-chingy-album-on-dtp/11981/ |title=Chingy returns to old label for new album |publisher=PrefixMag.com |date=October 21, 2007 |access-date=2010-08-05}}</ref>

''Hate It or Love It'' is Chingy's fourth studio album. The album featured production from [[Scott Storch]], [[Timbaland]], and [[Cool and Dre]]. The lead single is "Fly Like Me", featuring [[Amerie]]. The album was released on December 18, 2007, and featured appearances by [[Ludacris]], [[Bobby V]]alentino, [[Steph Jones]], [[Trey Songz]], [[Rick Ross]], and [[Anthony Hamilton (musician)|Anthony Hamilton]]. The album debuted at #84 on the ''Billboard'' 200, selling 30,000 copies, making it Chingy's first album not to crack the Top 10. ''Hate It or Love It'' was not released in the UK, marking Chingy's first album not to be released in the country.

===2009–2012: ''No Risk, No Reward''===
In 2012 Chingy announced he was working on his fifth studio album called ''No Risk No Reward'',  DTP  which was set to be released sometime in 2012, but as of June 2016  continues to be delayed due to lack of funding. "Superhero", featuring Full Dekk Music Group's artist Chris Woodhouse, was purported to be the first single from the album. Chingy then announced that he would be releasing a mixtape, ''Jackpot Back'', which was released March 3, 2012.

=== 2013–2016: "King Judah" and "Watch The World" ===
In Spring 2013, Chingy announced that he had become a practicing [[Black Hebrew Israelites|Black Hebrew Israelite]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hiphopclub.biz/2013/03/chingy-is-a-jew|title=Chingy is.......... A JEW???? |author=Miller, Sweetvanilla|website=HipHopClub.biz|date=2013-03-27|access-date=2013-03-27}}</ref> and released the music video for "King Judah". This was Chingy's attempt to follow a moral agenda and denouncing mainstream rap{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Currently Chingy is working on his upcoming EP album entitled ''Chingology'' which was released later this year.<ref name="twitter.com">{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ChingyFulldekk/status/348935564457816064|title=New EP #Chingology on the way |website=Twitter|date=June 23, 2013}}</ref>

Major media outlets in Australia and NZ leaked information about a new Chingy collaboration, "Watch The World", featuring New Zealand based Asian model/singer Lucy X (Lucy Xu) . The track produced by ChristopherKris (Kris Lal) is rumored to be featured on an upcoming compilation album released in 2014. The single was released on November 1, 2013, to iTunes and radio.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The song reached #2 on the iTunes Urban chart in both countries, with a video to follow in the coming months.
