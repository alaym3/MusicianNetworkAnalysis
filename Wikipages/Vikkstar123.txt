== YouTube career ==
Barn joined YouTube in 2010; having played games with his friends he got into watching YouTubers and making videos of their own. Eventually he decided to launch his own channel, stating:<ref name=":0">{{cite web|last=Reiner|first=Andrew|date=30 April 2015|title=An Interview With YouTube Sensation Vikkstar123|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/30/an-interview-with-youtube-sensation-vikkstar123.aspx|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126040358/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/04/30/an-interview-with-youtube-sensation-vikkstar123.aspx|archive-date=26 January 2021|access-date=20 February 2021|work=[[Game Informer]]|publisher=[[GameStop]]}}</ref>

<blockquote>I got involved thinking I might be able to do a little bit better than they were doing, and get involved and have some fun with it. I started recording myself playing ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]''. I started making tutorial videos that people could watch – some of them were for knives and how you could throw them across the map. I made videos showing places where you could throw a knife or tomahawk and get a kill. I thought it would be cool to show off these ridiculous kills.</blockquote>

As his popularity increased, he began to take it more seriously, branching out into ''[[Minecraft]]''.<ref name=":0" />

In 2013, he joined the Sidemen, which caused his popularity to rise further.<ref>{{cite web|last=Fogarty|first=Paul|date=17 September 2019|title=YouTube: Get to know all seven Sidemen members – Ethan, Tobi, Harry!|url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/09/17/youtube-sidemen-members-ethan-tobi-harry-ksi-miniminter-vik/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210209071019/https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/09/17/youtube-sidemen-members-ethan-tobi-harry-ksi-miniminter-vik/|archive-date=9 February 2021|access-date=20 February 2021|website=HITC}}</ref> He would later move in with three other members, sharing a house with them from 2014 to 2018, when he announced he was moving out of the Sidemen House.<ref name="TheTimes">{{Cite news |date=23 October 2021 |title= Who are the Sidemen?
