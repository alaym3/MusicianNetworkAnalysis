'''Filter''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band formed in 1993 in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, by singer [[Richard Patrick]] and guitarist and programmer [[Brian Liesegang]]. The band was formed when Patrick desired to start his own band after leaving [[Nine Inch Nails]] as their touring guitarist. Their debut album ''[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]'' was released in 1995 and ended up going platinum, largely due to the success of the single "[[Hey Man Nice Shot]]". After the album, the band would go through the first of many lineup changes, leaving Patrick as the only consistent member across all releases.

After Liesegang's departure in 1997, Patrick recorded a follow up album with the ''Short Bus'' [[Title of Record#Personnel|touring band members]], who became full-time members thereafter. The resulting effort, 1999's ''[[Title of Record]]'', also went platinum driven by the success of the song "[[Take a Picture (Filter song)|Take a Picture]]". A third album, ''[[The Amalgamut]]'', was released in 2002 with the same members, though sales stalled with Patrick checking into [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]] after years of heavy [[alcohol abuse|alcohol]] and [[drug abuse]] just as touring for the album had begun. The band went into hiatus while Patrick went to rehab, and then formed a new band, [[Army of Anyone]], which released [[Army of Anyone (album)|one self-titled album]]. After Army of Anyone went into hiatus, Patrick returned to Filter, releasing ''[[Anthems for the Damned]]'' in 2008, ''[[The Trouble with Angels (Filter album)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' in 2010, and ''[[The Sun Comes Out Tonight]]'' in 2013 with a revolving door of different musicians. A seventh studio album, ''[[Crazy Eyes (Filter album)|Crazy Eyes]]'', recorded with Patrick and another entirely new lineup, was released on April 8, 2016. In 2018, Brian Liesegang returned to Filter to work on a new album, ''reBus'' that was meant to musically be the follow up to ''Short Bus''. Due to the [[PledgeMusic]] bankruptcy, ''reBus'' was shelved and Patrick has since been working on a new album ''[[Murica (album)|Murica]]'', scheduled for release in 2021.

==History==

===''Short Bus'' (1993–1998)===
[[Richard Patrick]] played guitar with [[Nine Inch Nails]] during the [[Pretty Hate Machine Tour Series|touring for ''Pretty Hate Machine'']] and in the music videos for [[Broken (Nine Inch Nails EP)|''Broken'']]; he left the band while [[Trent Reznor]] was recording ''[[The Downward Spiral]]'' and began a new recording project with Brian Liesegang. Dubbing themselves Filter, they signed to [[Reprise Records]] in 1994 and recorded their first album, ''[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]'', which was released in the following year. The album was commercially successful, and included the hit single "[[Hey Man Nice Shot]]". This song was somewhat controversial, as it was seen as capitalizing on the public suicide of [[Budd Dwyer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.nyc.rr.com/alweisel/rollingstonefilter.htm|title=Hit, With a Bullet: Filter's "Hey Man Nice Shot"|date=July 13, 1995|publisher=Rolling Stone|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207074419/http://home.nyc.rr.com/alweisel/rollingstonefilter.htm|archive-date=December 7, 2008}}</ref> [[Kurt Cobain]]'s suicide was widely rumored to have inspired the song, but the band denied this.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/filter/articles/story/5925965/filter_are_back_in_the_fold|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920044847/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/filter/articles/story/5925965/filter_are_back_in_the_fold|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 20, 2008|title=Rolling Stone: Filter Are Back in the Fold|date=August 24, 1999|publisher=Rolling Stone}}</ref> The first single "[[Hey Man Nice Shot]]" was also included in the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Demon Knight (soundtrack)|Tales from the Crypt: Demon Knight]]'' in 1995 before ''[[Short Bus (album)|Short Bus]]'' was released. In need of a live band to tour the album, Patrick and Liesegang recruited Geno Lenardo on guitar, Frank Cavanagh on bass, and [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] on drums. They would all later be featured in the video for the album's second single, "Dose".

Between Filter's first and second albums, the band became known for their soundtrack contributions, The first of these tracks, "Thanks Bro", landed on the ''[[Songs in the Key of X: Music from and Inspired by the X-Files]]'' album. In 1996, Filter recorded and filmed the video for the song "Jurassitol", for ''[[The Crow: City of Angels]]'' soundtrack. They also released the home video ''Phenomenology'' in 1996, which showcased some of the band's live performances and music videos, as well as an interview with Patrick and Liesegang filmed in [[New Mexico]].

Liesegang left in 1997 shortly after recording the Filter/[[The Crystal Method|Crystal Method]] collaboration "[[(Can't You) Trip Like I Do]]" for the ''[[Spawn (1997 film)|Spawn]]'' movie soundtrack, due to creative differences with Patrick. In 1998, for ''[[The X-Files]]'' film soundtrack, Patrick decided to keep the Filter name and recorded a cover of [[Harry Nilsson]]'s "[[One (Harry Nilsson song)|One]]".

===''Title of Record'' (1999–2001)===
Patrick continued with 1999's ''[[Title of Record]]'' with returning members Lenardo and Cavanagh, as well as Steve Gillis on drums,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428963/19990615/filter.jhtml|title=Filter Readying New Album, Video|date=June 15, 1999|publisher=MTV}}</ref> filling in the gap left by Walker after he left to work with [[The Smashing Pumpkins]]. ''Title of Record'' moved away from industrial rock somewhat, and resulted in the band's biggest hit, the mellow ballad "[[Take a Picture (Filter song)|Take a Picture]]", along with other lesser-heard singles "Welcome to the Fold" and "The Best Things". The song "Take a Picture" is about a dispute on an aircraft, when Richard Patrick drunkenly stripped down to his boxers, alarming the other passengers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/f/filter/filterfeature99_2.jhtml|title=Filter: Title Of Feature|date=November 2, 1999|publisher=MTV|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202230018/http://www.mtv.com/bands/archive/f/filter/filterfeature99_2.jhtml|archive-date=February 2, 2008}}</ref> "Miss Blue" is said to have been about [[Smashing Pumpkins]] bassist [[D'arcy Wretzky]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_Q5yxG8QcE|title=Richard Patrick Wiki Fact or Fiction|publisher=Loudwire}}</ref> She can be heard on the songs "Cancer", and "Take a Picture".

===''The Amalgamut'' (2002)===
2002 saw the release of ''[[The Amalgamut]]'', featuring the singles "[[Where Do We Go from Here (Filter song)|Where Do We Go from Here?]]" and "American Cliché". "The Only Way (Is the Wrong Way)" was also featured in the first wave of the [[Hummer H2]] commercials that year and in the 2003 movie ''[[Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life]]''. Alan Bailey was recruited for live guitar when they set off to tour the album; however, the tour ended abruptly in a matter of weeks when Richard Patrick voluntarily checked himself into [[Drug rehabilitation|rehab]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=6524|title=FILTER Frontman Checks Into Rehab, Band Cancel Tour|date=October 1, 2002|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]}}</ref> He has since tattooed his date of sobriety, September 28, 2002, on his forearm. Lenardo, Gillis and Cavanagh all left the group at this time.

===Hiatus and side projects (2003–2007)===
Richard Patrick was part of the [[Supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[The Damning Well]], which has only released one track on the ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' movie soundtrack in 2003. While rumors sparked that an entire album's worth of material was produced, Patrick later denied this in an interview, stating the bits and pieces of other rough tracks mostly wound up in [[Black Light Burns]], save for the track ''In Dreams'' on the then upcoming Filter album ''Anthems for the Damned''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://puregrainaudio.com/interviews/filter|title=Pure Grain Audio - Filter}}</ref>

[[Army of Anyone]], a second supergroup side project with drummer [[Ray Luzier]] and [[Stone Temple Pilots]] members [[Robert DeLeo|Robert]] and [[Dean DeLeo]], released its [[Army of Anyone (album)|debut album]] on November 14, 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62608|title=ARMY OF ANYONE's Debut Enters Billboard Chart At No.&nbsp;56|date=November 22, 2006|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202230932/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=62608|archive-date=February 2, 2008}}</ref> However, lack of sales of the album coupled with Richard Patrick's desire to do more work with Filter, led the band breaking up around mid-2007.

Former Filter members Brian Liesegang and [[Matt Walker (drummer)|Matt Walker]] played keyboards and drums (respectively) in [[Billy Corgan]]'s touring band in 2005 to promote his solo album. It was heavily rumored that Geno Lenardo and Frank Cavanagh were going to be involved with lead singer of [[Adema]], Mark Chavez, in a band called State of Mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=31716|title=FILTER Mainman Says Fans Will Be 'Stunned' By The Group's New Lineup|date=January 19, 2005|publisher=[[Blabbermouth]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080202230925/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=31716|archive-date=February 2, 2008}}</ref> These rumors proved to be false.

===''Anthems for the Damned'' (2007–2009)===
[[File:Filter, 2008.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Filter in 2008]]
As Army of Anyone wound down, Patrick began working on material for a new Filter album, to eventually be titled ''[[Anthems for the Damned]]''. Released to the public in May 2008, it was more serious in tone than some expected and expresses more of his mixed emotions regarding the state of the world and the state of his life.

On March 7, 2008, it was announced that Frank Cavanagh had reunited with Filter and would play as a live member at the operation Myspace concert in Kuwait. It was confirmed at [[Operation MySpace]] that he would not be joining Filter on the full tour as he would be shipping off to Iraq in April. The only song played live during the performance of March 10 by Cavanagh, now a Sergeant and Paralegal in the U.S. Army Reserve, was the band's first mainstream hit, "Hey, Man, Nice Shot".

Patrick also announced a remix album to ''Anthems for the Damned'' on November 4, titled ''Remixes for the Damned''.<ref>{{cite web |last=Powers |first=Nicole |url=http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Filter+For+The+Damned |title=Filter For The Damned (09/2008) |publisher=Suicide Girls |date=September 13, 2008 |access-date=October 30, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234005/http://suicidegirls.com/interviews/Filter%2BFor%2BThe%2BDamned |archive-date=September 11, 2013  }}</ref> ''Remixes for the Damned'' was released on November 21, 2008 in the U.S. and Canada. The remix album was released internationally on December 1, 2008. The lead-off single was "I Keep Flowers Around".

A greatest hits album entitled ''[[The Very Best Things (1995–2008)]]'' was released March 31, 2009. It featured tracks from all four previous studio albums and various movie soundtrack contributions, but no new content. There are 14 tracks total, with some tracks being radio edits.

===''The Trouble with Angels'' (2009–2011)===
Filter started working on a fifth album shortly after the release of the remix and greatest hits albums, with Bob Marlette as a producer. The album, as said by Richard Patrick, would be a lot heavier than ''Anthems for the Damned'' and is to have a song written for the Amalgamut on it. He also stated he would be moving away from the political lyrical content present in ''Anthems for the Damned''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=430 |title=Fender News |publisher=Fender.com |access-date=August 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100614023146/http://www.fender.com/news/index.php?display_article=430 |archive-date=June 14, 2010  }}</ref>
When asked about the direction of his upcoming music style in an interview with [[Suicide Girls]] on September 13, 2008, Patrick said, "Actually the stuff I’m writing right now for a record that I’m going to release sometime next year is actually way more heavy industrial, more electronic. There’s probably not going to be that many live drums on it." It is important to note that he originally saw this album releasing in 2009, while it obviously slipped into 2010.

Richard Patrick has stated on the Filter website that he has been recording songs for movies recently. Filter covered the song "[[Happy Together (song)|Happy Together]]" by [[The Turtles]] for the soundtrack to the movie ''[[The Stepfather (2009 film)|The Stepfather]]'' (2009). The song features ambient sound with alternative metal. It was used in a promo for the seventh season of [[Criminal Minds]] and also a trailer for [[Baz Luhrmann]]'s ''[[The Great Gatsby (2013 film)|The Great Gatsby]]'' (2013).

Filter also contributed a new song "Fades Like a Photograph" for the soundtrack of the movie ''[[2012 (film)|2012]]'' (2009). The song saw Patrick reuniting with former Filter co-conspirator, Brian Liesegang, who co-produced the track.

Through the end of 2009 and into 2010, Filter released a series of fourteen studio updates chronicling the progress made on the album. Each update touched on a certain part of the album process, such as "recording guitar parts" or "mixing the album". The last studio updates confirmed that the album recording had been completed. In their last studio video update, Richard Patrick showcased two clips from final mixed songs on iTunes that listed track listing and track lengths. While the video was legitimate, it was not the actual final track list, it was only a collection of new Filter songs on a playlist.

Filter released "The Inevitable Relapse", as their first single on May 26. The song was made available on the band's official website as a free digital download. ''[[The Trouble with Angels (Filter album)|The Trouble with Angels]]'' was released on August 17, 2010 on the Rocket Science Ventures record label.

After the album's release, the band also released a cover of [[ZZ Top]]'s hit single "[[Gimme All Your Lovin']]" which appears on the compilation ''ZZ Top: A Tribute from Friends''.

===''The Sun Comes Out Tonight'' (2012–2013)===
[[File:Filter 2013.jpg|thumb|Richard Patrick and Jonathan Radtke in 2013]]
Patrick and Jonathan Radtke entered the studio with producer [[Bob Marlette]] in April 2012 to work on the sixth Filter studio album, titled ''[[The Sun Comes Out Tonight]]''.<ref name="loudwire1">{{cite web|url=http://loudwire.com/filter-heading-to-the-studio-in-april/ |title=Filter Heading to the Studio in April |publisher=Loudwire.com |access-date=March 30, 2012}}</ref> The first single off the new album, "What Do You Say", was released on April 2, 2013.

===''Murica'' (2018–present)===

In early 2018, original member Brian Liesegang returned to Filter after 21 years and started working with Patrick on the band's 8th studio album. The latter mentioned that "Brian and I are making the official follow up to Short Bus (maybe), called Re-Bus". Liesegang offered an official statement regarding the project: "We are gearing up for official reboot of initial Filter. Working right at this instant together on lyrics. We have fun afternoons and focusing the loud and the pretty noise maelstrom. Gonna be a full length, and its hard or maybe not right to call it a sequel, as it's not so much that in that it is just a return to a certain approach and philosophy. Whatever.
