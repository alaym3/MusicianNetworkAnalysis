==Career==
===2000–2007: The Dresden Dolls and ''The Onion Cellar''===
{{main|The Dresden Dolls}}
[[File:Amanda Palmer - Dresden Dolls (241481991).jpg|thumb|250px|right|Palmer performing with The Dresden Dolls at Kings Arms Tavern in [[Auckland]], New Zealand, September 2006]]
At a [[Halloween]] party in 2000, Palmer met drummer [[Brian Viglione]] and afterwards they formed The Dresden Dolls. In an effort to expand the performance experience and interactivity, Palmer began inviting [[Lexington High School (Massachusetts)|Lexington High School]] students to perform drama pieces at the Dresden Dolls' live shows. This evolved to The Dirty Business Brigade, a troupe of seasoned and new artists, performing at many gigs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thedirtybusinessbrigade.net |title=Dirty Business Brigade website |work=Thedirtybusinessbrigade.net |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704184115/http://thedirtybusinessbrigade.net/ |archive-date=July 4, 2008 }}</ref>

In 2002, after developing a [[cult following]], the band recorded their [[eponymous]] debut album, ''[[The Dresden Dolls (album)|The Dresden Dolls]]'', with producer [[Martin Bisi]] (of Indie, Brooklyn, New York fame). They produced the album before signing with the label [[Roadrunner Records]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 2006, ''[[The Dresden Dolls Companion]]''<ref name="DDcompanion">The Dresden Dolls Companion, by Amanda Palmer, eight foot music publishing, June 2006, {{ISBN|1-57560-888-X}} {{ISBN|978-1-57560-888-4}}</ref> was published, with words, music and artwork by Amanda Palmer.<ref name="DDcompanion"/> In it she has written a history of the album ''The Dresden Dolls'' and of the duo, as well as a partial autobiography. The book also contains the lyrics, [[sheet music]], and notes on each song in the album, all written by Palmer, as well as a DVD with a 20-minute interview of Amanda about making the book.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

Palmer conceived the musical/production ''[[The Onion Cellar]]'', based on a short story from ''[[The Tin Drum]]'' by [[Günter Grass]]. From December 9, 2006, through January 13, 2007, The Dresden Dolls performed the piece in conjunction with the [[American Repertory Theater]] at the Zero Arrow Theatre in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. While Palmer was openly frustrated with the direction of the show, fan and critical reviews were very positive.<ref>

Though the Dresden Dolls broke up in 2008, Palmer and Viglione have continued to collaborate, and have had several minor reunions under the band name in 2011, 2012, 2016, 2017, and 2018.<ref name="auto1">{{Cite news|url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2017/08/the-dresden-dolls-return-with-new-fall-tour-dates/|title=The Dresden Dolls return with new fall tour dates|date=2017-08-16|work=Consequence of Sound|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en-US}}</ref>

===2007–2010: ''Who Killed Amanda Palmer'', ''Evelyn Evelyn'', and theatrical work===
{{main article|Evelyn Evelyn}}
In July 2007, Palmer played three sold-out shows (in Boston, Hoboken, and NYC) in a new "with band" format. Her backing band was Boston alternative rock group [[Aberdeen City (band)|Aberdeen City]], who also opened along with Dixie Dirt. In August 2007, Palmer traveled to perform in the [[Famous Spiegeltent|Spiegeltent]] and other venues at the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in Scotland, and also performed on [[BBC Two]]'s ''The Edinburgh Show''.

In September 2007, Palmer collaborated with [[Jason Webley]] to launch the new project [[Evelyn Evelyn]] with the EP ''[[Elephant Elephant]]''. In the project, the duo play conjoined twin sisters named Eva and Lyn, and through their music tell their fictional backstory.

In July 2008, the Dresden Dolls released a second book, the ''Virginia Companion'', a follow-up to ''The Dresden Dolls Companion'', featuring the music and lyrics from the ''[[Yes, Virginia...]]''(2006) and ''[[No, Virginia...]]'' (2008) albums, produced by Sean Slade and Paul Kolderie.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In 2009, Palmer went back to her alma mater, [[Lexington High School (Massachusetts)|Lexington High School]] in Massachusetts, to collaborate with her old director and mentor Steven Bogart on a workshop piece for the department's spring production. The play, ''With The Needle That Sings In Her Heart'', was inspired by [[Neutral Milk Hotel]]'s album ''[[In the Aeroplane Over the Sea]]'' and ''[[The Diary of Anne Frank]]''.

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic|global pandemic of COVID-19]] that struck at the end of 2019, Amanda Palmer was on an international tour of her latest album, ''There Will Be No Intermission'', when countries started grounding flights and locking down borders. Palmer found herself in Havelock North, New Zealand, the last stop on her tour schedule, and on 25 March 2020, New Zealand's government announced that the whole country would move to COVID-19 Alert Level 4: complete lockdown and quarantining of people within their own homes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-52961539 |title=New Zealand lifts all Covid restrictions, declaring the nation virus-free|website=Bbc.co.uk |date=8 June 2020}}</ref> Before that, Palmer had quickly brought her husband Neil Gaiman and son Ash to join her in New Zealand, searching for a suitable place to stay, in anticipation that they would be under lockdown for several months. Both the musician and the author confirmed that their upcoming shows in June 2020 would have to be cancelled and audiences refunded.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-yN8daFTZ8/?igshid=1hmh9hjmnxmu2 |title=@amandapalmer on Instagram: a little message from me and @neilhimself|website=Instagram.com |date=10 April 2020}}</ref>

At some publicly unknown point during the couple's stay in Havelock North, New Zealand, their marriage underwent difficulties.
