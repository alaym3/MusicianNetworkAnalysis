==Career==
===2017: Beginnings===
On 10 March 2017 B Young released "London Boy", his debut single. He also remixed UK Rapper Dave's hit "Wanna Know" on 6 April 2017. Followed by his second single"Cash Flow", which he released on 7 May 2020.

On 25 August 2017, B Young released "Been Wavey". The song, which has racked up over 11 million views on YouTube, helped gain B Young traction and allowed Jumanji to reach the heights it did. In an interview with Capital XTRA, he said that he believed Been Wavey was better than Jumanji, and they are similar as they were recorded and created together.

===2018–present: Breakthrough===
On 5 January 2018, B Young released his debut studio single "Jumanji", which entered the UK chart at number 64. It has since spent six weeks in the top 20, and twenty-four weeks in the top 100, peaking at number 13 in the UK charts and number 5 in the UK R&B charts. Later that year, he released "079ME" and "Juice", which both also entered the UK charts. 079ME peaked at number 23 in the UK charts, and number 12 in the UK R&B charts. It spent 16 weeks in the top 100. Juice reached number 96 in the UK charts.<ref name=offcharts />

In July 2019, B Young released Gucci Demon, which peaked at number 44 in the UK charts. Other than that, it was a quiet year for B Young, as he was barely active on any social media platforms and released just one single.

On 13 February 2020, B Young released "Wine". He has pledged to release music more often last year with an impending project looming.  On 19 March 2020, he released "Want2". In August 2020, he released "Last Night" featuring Tion Wayne.
