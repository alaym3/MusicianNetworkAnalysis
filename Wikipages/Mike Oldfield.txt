'''Michael Gordon Oldfield''' (born 15 May 1953)<ref>{{cite book |section=Oldfield Mike |section-url=http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195313734.013.20694 |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |first=Colin |last=Larkin |author-link=Colin Larkin (writer) |edition=4th |date=2006 |isbn=9780199726363}}</ref> is a British musician, multi-instrumentalist and songwriter best known for his debut studio album ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973), which became an unexpected critical and commercial success and propelled him to worldwide fame. Though primarily a guitarist, Oldfield is known for playing a range of instruments, which includes keyboards and percussion, and doing vocals. He has adopted a range of musical styles throughout his career, including [[progressive rock]], [[World music|world]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[Classical music|classical]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Ambient music|ambient]], and [[new age music]].

Oldfield took up the guitar at age ten and left school in his teens to embark on a music career. From 1967 to 1970, he and his sister [[Sally Oldfield]] were a folk duo [[The Sallyangie]], after which he performed with [[Kevin Ayers]]. In 1971, Oldfield started work on ''Tubular Bells'' which caught the attention of [[Richard Branson]], who agreed to release it on his new label, [[Virgin Records]]. Its opening was used in the horror film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' and the album went on to sell over 2.7 million copies in the UK. Oldfield followed it with ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'' (1974), ''[[Ommadawn]]'' (1975), and ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]'' (1978), all of which feature longform and mostly instrumental pieces.

In the late 1970s, Oldfield began to tour and release more commercial and song-based music, beginning with ''[[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|Platinum]]'' (1979), ''[[QE2 (album)|QE2]]'' (1980), and ''[[Five Miles Out]]'' (1982). His most successful album of this period was ''[[Crises (Mike Oldfield album)|Crises]]'' (1983), which features the worldwide hit single "[[Moonlight Shadow]]" with vocalist [[Maggie Reilly]]. After signing with [[Warner Music Group|WEA]] in the early 1990s, Oldfield's most significant album of the decade was ''[[Tubular Bells II]]'' (1992) and experimented with virtual reality and gaming content with his [[MusicVR]] project. In 2012, he performed at the opening ceremony for the [[2012 Olympic Games]] held in London. [[Mike Oldfield discography|Oldfield's discography]] includes 26 studio albums, nine of which have reached the UK top-ten. His most recent album is ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'' (2017).

==Early life==
Oldfield was born on 15 May 1953 in [[Reading, Berkshire]], to Raymond Oldfield, a [[general practitioner]], and Maureen (''[[née]]'' Liston), an Irish woman.<ref name="omnotes">{{cite web |url=http://www.amarok.ommadawn.net/mike/discog/extras/ommadawnnotes.htm |title=Ommadawn |website=amarok.ommadawn.net |first=Rob |last=Miles |access-date=11 July 2008}}</ref><ref name=HAE02>{{cite web |url=https://tubular.net/articles/2002_08d/Interview-with-Mike-Oldfield-from-BBC-1s-Heaven-and-Hearth |title=Interview with Mike Oldfield from BBC 1's Heaven and Hearth |work=Heaven and Earth |via=Tubular.net |first=Alice |last=Beer |date=25 August 2002 |access-date=12 September 2019}}</ref> He has two elder siblings, sister [[Sally Oldfield|Sally]] and brother [[Terry Oldfield|Terence]].{{sfn|Dewey|2013|p=8}} When Oldfield was seven, his mother gave birth to a younger brother, David, who had [[Down syndrome]] and died in infancy. His mother was prescribed [[barbiturate]]s, to which she became addicted. She suffered from mental health problems and would spend much of the rest of her life in mental institutions, dying in early 1975, shortly after Oldfield had started writing ''[[Ommadawn]]''.<ref name=D92>{{cite web |url=https://tubular.net/articles/1992_12/Saved-by-the-Bells |title=Saved by the Bells |work=Details |via=Tubular.net |first=William |last=Show |date=December 1992 |access-date=12 September 2019}}</ref><ref name=2010CD>{{cite AV media notes |title=Ommadawn [2010 Reissue] |year=1975 |id=532 676-2 |publisher=Mercury Records |type=Booklet essay |pages=3–5, 7–9 |first=Mark |last=Powell}}</ref>

Oldfield attended (what was then called) [[St Joseph's College, Reading|St. Joseph's Convent School]], [[The Highlands School, Reading|Highlands Junior School]], St. Edward's Preparatory School (still located in Tilehurst Road)<ref name=changeling>{{cite book |title=[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|Changeling]] |first=Mike |last=Oldfield |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-85227-381-1 |publisher=[[Virgin Books]]}}</ref> and [[Elvian School|Presentation College]] (Bath Road), all in Reading. When he was thirteen, the family moved to [[Harold Wood]], then in [[Essex]], and Oldfield attended [[Emerson Park Academy|Hornchurch Grammar School]] where, having already displayed musical talent, he earned one [[General Certificate of Education|GCE]] qualification in English.{{sfn|Moraghan|1993|pp=11–12}}

Oldfield took up the guitar aged ten, first learning on a 6-string acoustic instrument which his father had given to him.<ref name=GP78/> He learned technique by copying parts from songs, by folk guitarists [[Bert Jansch]] and [[John Renbourn]], that he played on a portable record player. He tried to learn musical notation but was a "very, very slow" learner, saying: "If I have to, I can write things down. But I don't like to."<ref name=SOS13/> By the time he was 12, Oldfield played the electric guitar and performed in local folk and youth clubs and dances, earning as much as £4 per gig.<ref name=GP78/><ref name=SOS13/><ref name="bbc.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b08b2fvr |title=Mike Oldfield, The First Time With... - BBC Radio 6 Music |website=BBC}}</ref> During a six-month break from music that Oldfield had around this time, he took up painting. In May 1968, when Oldfield turned fifteen, his school headmaster requested that he cut his long hair. Oldfield refused and left abruptly. He then decided to pursue music on a full-time, professional basis.{{sfn|Moraghan|1993|pp=11–12}}<ref name=GP78>{{cite web|url=https://tubular.net/articles/1978_xx/Mike-Oldfield-A-Rare-Interview-With-The-English-Guitarist-Studio-Wizard-and-Composer-of-Tubular-Bells|title=Mike Oldfield: A Rare Interview With The English Guitarist, Studio Wizard, and Composer of "Tubular Bells"

==Career==
===1968–1972: Early career===
After leaving school Oldfield accepted an invitation from his sister Sally to form a folk duo [[The Sallyangie]], taking its name from her name and Oldfield's favourite Jansch tune, "Angie".{{sfn|Moraghan|1993|p=12}} They toured England and Paris and struck a deal with [[Transatlantic Records]], for which they recorded one album, ''[[Children of the Sun (The Sallyangie album)|Children of the Sun]]'' (1969). After they split in the following year Oldfield suffered a [[nervous breakdown]]. He auditioned as bassist for [[Family (band)|Family]] in 1969 following the departure of [[Ric Grech]], but the group did not share [[Roger Chapman]]'s enthusiasm towards Oldfield's performance.<ref name=TS12>{{cite AV media notes|url=https://tubular.net/articles/2012_08c/Two-Sides-Sleeve-Notes|title=Two Sides: The Very Best of Mike Oldfield|year=2012|publisher=Mercury Records|id=5339182}}</ref> Oldfield spent much of the next year living off his father and performing in an electric rock band named Barefoot that included his brother Terry on flute, until the group disbanded in early 1970.{{sfn|Moraghan|1993|p=13}}<ref name=G97>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1997_07 |title=Not Totally Tubular |first=Dave |last=Thompson |work=Goldmine|via=Tubular.net |date=18 July 1997 |access-date=2 April 2008}}</ref>

In February 1970, Oldfield auditioned as the bassist in The Whole World, a new backing band that former [[Soft Machine]] vocalist [[Kevin Ayers]] was putting together. He landed the position despite the bass being a new instrument for him, but he also played occasional lead guitar and later looked back on this time as providing valuable training on the bass.{{sfn|Moraghan|1993|p=14}}<ref name=SOS13/> Oldfield went on to play on Ayers's albums ''[[Shooting at the Moon (album)|Shooting at the Moon]]'' (1970) and ''[[Whatevershebringswesing]]'' (1971), and played mandolin on ''[[Edgar Broughton Band (album)|Edgar Broughton Band]]'' (1971).<ref name=G97/> All three albums were recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]], where Oldfield familiarised himself with a variety of instruments, such as orchestral percussion, piano, [[Mellotron]], and [[harpsichord]], and started to write and put down musical ideas of his own.<ref name=SOS13/> While doing so Oldfield took up work as a reserve guitarist in a stage production of ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' at the [[Shaftesbury Theatre]], where he played and gigged with [[Alex Harvey (musician)|Alex Harvey]]. After ten performances Oldfield grew bored of the job and was fired after he decided to play his part for "Let the Sunshine In" in [[Time signature|7/8 time]].<ref name=SOS13>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.soundonsound.com/people/classic-tracks-mike-oldfield-tubular-bells|title=Classic Tracks: Mike Oldfield Tubular Bells|date=April 2013|first=Richard|last=Buskin|magazine=Sound on Sound|access-date=25 February 2019}}</ref><ref name="bbc.co.uk"/>

===1971–1991: Virgin years===
====''Tubular Bells''====
By mid-1971, Oldfield had assembled a demo tape containing sections of a longform instrumental piece initially titled "Opus One". Attempts to secure a recording deal to record it professionally came to nothing. In September 1971, Oldfield, now a session musician and bassist for the [[Arthur Louis|Arthur Louis Band]], attended recording sessions at [[The Manor Studio]] near [[Kidlington]], [[Oxfordshire]], owned by businessman [[Richard Branson]] and run by engineers [[Tom Newman (musician)|Tom Newman]] and Simon Heyworth.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> Branson already had several business ventures and was about to launch [[Virgin Records]] with Simon Draper. Newman and Heyworth heard some of Oldfield's demos and took them to Branson and Draper, who eventually gave Oldfield one week of recording time at The Manor, after which Oldfield had completed what became "Part One" of his composition, ''[[Tubular Bells]]''. He recorded "Part Two" from February to April 1973.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/2001_08 |title=The Making of Tubular Bells |work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |date=August 2001 |access-date=12 January 2012}}</ref> Branson agreed to release ''Tubular Bells'' as the first record on the Virgin label and secured Oldfield a six-album deal with an additional four albums as optional.<ref name=TT13>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/fameandfortune/9811942/Mike-Oldfield-Tubular-Bells-made-me-a-million-but-the-tax-bill-came-to-860000.html|title=Mike Oldfield: 'Tubular Bells made me a million but the tax bill came to £860,000'|date=20 January 2013|work=The Telegraph|first=Sarah|last=Ewing|access-date=26 February 2019}}</ref>

''Tubular Bells'' was released on 25 May 1973. Oldfield played more than twenty different instruments in the [[Overdubbing|multi-layered recording]], and its style moved through diverse musical genres. Its 2,630,000 UK sales puts it at No.&nbsp;34 on the list of the best-selling albums in the country. The title track became a top 10 hit single in the US after the opening was used in the film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'' in 1973. It is today considered to be a forerunner of the [[New-age music|new-age music movement]].<ref>{{cite book |first=Patti Jean |last=Birosik |title=The New Age Music Guide |year=1989 |publisher=Collier MacMillan |page=138 |isbn=0-02-041640-7}}</ref>

====''Hergest Ridge'' to ''Incantations''====
In 1974, Oldfield played the guitar on the critically acclaimed album ''[[Rock Bottom (album)|Rock Bottom]]'' by [[Robert Wyatt]].

In late 1974, his follow-up LP, ''[[Hergest Ridge (album)|Hergest Ridge]]'', was No.&nbsp;1 in the UK for three weeks before being dethroned by ''Tubular Bells''. Although ''Hergest Ridge'' was released over a year after ''Tubular Bells'', it reached No.&nbsp;1 first. ''Tubular Bells'' spent 11 weeks (10 of them consecutive) at No.&nbsp;2 before its one week at the top. Like ''Tubular Bells'', ''Hergest Ridge'' is a two-movement instrumental piece, this time evoking scenes from Oldfield's [[Herefordshire]] country retreat. It was followed in 1975 by the pioneering [[world music]] piece ''[[Ommadawn]]'' released after the death of his mother Maureen.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amadian.net/biography1.htm |title=''Amadian - The Mike Oldfield Biography (II)'' website |access-date=26 January 2015}}</ref>

In 1975, Oldfield recorded a version of the Christmas piece "[[In Dulci Jubilo (Mike Oldfield)|In Dulci Jubilo]]" which charted at No.&nbsp;4 in the UK.

In 1975, Oldfield received a [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition|Grammy award for Best Instrumental Composition]] in "Tubular Bells – Theme from ''The Exorcist''".

In 1976, Oldfield and his sister joined his friend and band member [[Pekka Pohjola]] to play on his album ''[[Mathematician's Air Display]]'', which was released in 1977. The album was recorded and edited at Oldfield's Througham Slad Manor in [[Gloucestershire]] by Oldfield and Paul Lindsay. Oldfield's 1976 rendition of "[[Portsmouth (Mike Oldfield single)|Portsmouth]]" remains his best-performing single on the [[UK Singles Chart]], reaching No.&nbsp;3.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.everyhit.com|title=Mike Oldfield – "Portsmouth"|publisher=EveryHit|access-date=8 July 2010}}</ref>

Oldfield recorded the double album ''[[Incantations (album)|Incantations]]'' between December 1977 and September 1978. This introduced more diverse choral performances from [[Sally Oldfield]], [[Maddy Prior]], and the [[Queen's College, London|Queen's College]] Girls Choir. When it was released on 1 December 1978, the album went to No. 14 in the UK and reached platinum certification for 300,000 copies sold.

In June 1978, during the recording of ''Incantations'', Oldfield and his siblings completed a three-day [[Exegesis (group)|Exegesis]] seminar, a controversial self-assertiveness program based on [[Werner Erhard]]'s [[Erhard Seminars Training|EST training program]]. The experience had a significant effect on Oldfield's personality, who recalled that he underwent a "rebirth experience" by reliving past fears. "It was like opening some huge cathedral doors and facing the monster, and I saw that the monster was myself as a newborn infant, because I'd started life in a panic."<ref name=G97/><ref name=MM78>{{cite news|url=https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/mike-oldfield-this-is-the-year-of-the-expanding-man|title=Mike Oldfield: This is the Year of the Expanding Man...|first=Karl|last=Dallas|newspaper=Melody Maker|date=25 November 1978|via=[[Rock's Backpages]]|url-access=subscription |access-date=28 February 2019}}</ref> Following the Exegesis seminar, the formerly reclusive Oldfield granted press interviews, posed nude for a promotional photo shoot for ''Incantations'', and went drinking with news reporters. He had also conquered his fear of flying, gained a pilot's license, and bought his own plane.<ref name=TI93>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/arts-sound-as-a-bell-twenty-years-ago-tubular-bells-rang-out-for-the-first-time-now-after-years-of-1453352.html|title=Sound as a bell|first=Charles|last=Nevin|date=4 April 1993|work=The Independent|access-date=18 September 2019}}</ref>

In 1979, Oldfield supported ''Incantations'' with a European tour that spanned 21 dates between March and May 1979. The tour was documented with the live album and concert film, ''[[Exposed (Mike Oldfield album)|Exposed]]''. Initially marketed as a limited pressing of 100,000 copies, the strength of sales for the album were strong enough for Virgin to abandon the idea shortly after, transferring it to regular production.<ref name=G97/> During the tour Oldfield released the disco-influenced non-album single "[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield instrumental)|Guilty]]", for which he went to New York City to find the best session musicians and write a song with them in mind. He wrote a chord chart for the song and presented it to the group, who completed it in the studio.<ref name=TS12/> Released in April 1979, the song went to No. 22 in the UK and Oldfield performed the song on the national television show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''.

Oldfield's music was used for the score of ''[[The Space Movie]]'' (1980), a [[Virgin Films]] production that celebrated the tenth anniversary of the [[Apollo 11]] mission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mikeoldfieldspacemoviedvd.com/|title=''The Space Movie'' website|access-date=25 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517093522/http://mikeoldfieldspacemoviedvd.com/|archive-date=17 May 2010}}</ref> In 1979, he recorded a version of [[Blue Peter (instrumental)|the signature tune]] for the BBC children's television programme ''[[Blue Peter]]'', which was used by the show for 10 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newtalent/under_16/showcase_bp.shtml |title=Blue Peter's theme tune |publisher=BBC New Talent |date=April 2007 |access-date=20 June 2010}}</ref>

====''Platinum'' to ''Heaven's Open''====
Oldfield's fifth album, ''[[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|Platinum]]'', was released in November 1979 and marked the start of his transition from long compositions towards mainstream and pop music. Oldfield performed across Europe between April and December 1980 with the [[In Concert 1980]] tour.

In 1980, Oldfield released ''[[QE2 (album)|QE2]]'', named after the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|ocean liner]], which features a variety of guest musicians including [[Phil Collins]] on drums. This was followed by the European Adventure Tour 1981, during which Oldfield accepted an invitation to perform at a free concert celebrating the [[Wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer|wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana]] in [[Guildhall]]. He wrote a new track, "Royal Wedding Anthem", for the occasion.<ref name=G97/>

His next album, ''[[Five Miles Out]]'', followed in March 1982, which features the 24-minute track "Taurus II" occupying side one. The Five Miles Out World Tour 1982 saw Oldfield perform from April to December of that year. ''[[Crises (Mike Oldfield album)|Crises]]'' saw Oldfield continue the pattern of one long composition with shorter songs. The first single from the album, "[[Moonlight Shadow]]", with [[Maggie Reilly]] on vocals, became Oldfield's most successful single, reaching No. 4 in the UK<ref name=G97/> and No. 1 in nine other countries. The subsequent Crises Tour in 1983 concluded with a concert at [[Wembley Arena]] to commemorate the tenth anniversary of ''Tubular Bells''. The next album, ''[[Discovery (Mike Oldfield album)|Discovery]]'', continues with this trend, being the first single "[[To France]]" and subsequent Discovery Tour 1984.

Oldfield later turned to film and video, writing [[The Killing Fields (album)|the score]] for [[Roland Joffé]]'s acclaimed film ''[[The Killing Fields (movie)|The Killing Fields]]'' and producing substantial video footage for his album ''[[Islands (Mike Oldfield album)|Islands]]''. ''Islands'' continued what Oldfield had been doing on the past couple of albums, with an instrumental piece on one side and rock/pop singles on the other. Of these, "[[Islands (Mike Oldfield song)|Islands]]", sung by [[Bonnie Tyler]] and "[[Magic Touch (Mike Oldfield song)|Magic Touch]]", with vocals by [[Max Bacon]] (in the US version) and [[Glasgow]] vocalist Jim Price (Southside Jimmy) in the rest of the world,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southsidejimmy.co.uk/site/pages/biog.htm |title=Southside Jimmy Biography |publisher=Southside Jimmy |access-date=2 November 2008}}</ref> were the major hits. In the US "Magic Touch" reached the top 10 on the [[Billboard charts|Billboard album rock charts]] in 1988. During the 1980s, Oldfield's then-wife, Norwegian singer [[Anita Hegerland]], contributed vocals to many songs including "[[Pictures in the Dark]]".

Released in July 1989, ''[[Earth Moving]]'' features seven vocalists across the album's nine tracks.<ref name=G97/> It is Oldfield's first to consist solely of rock and pop songs, several of which were released as singles: "[[Innocent (Mike Oldfield song)|Innocent]]" and "[[(One Glance Is) Holy|Holy]]" in Europe, and "Hostage" in the US.

For his next instrumental album, Virgin insisted that Oldfield use the title ''Tubular Bells 2''.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013-05-20|title=How we made: Richard Branson and Mike Oldfield on Tubular Bells|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/20/how-we-made-tubular-bells|access-date=2021-10-12|website=the Guardian|language=en}}</ref> Oldfield's rebellious response was ''[[Amarok (Mike Oldfield album)|Amarok]]'', an hour-long work featuring rapidly changing themes, unpredictable bursts of noise and a hidden [[Morse code]] insult, stating "Fuck off RB", allegedly directed at [[Richard Branson|Branson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/mar/20/mike-oldfield-interview-tubular-bells-drugs |title=Mike Oldfield: 'We wouldn't have had Tubular Bells without drugs' |newspaper=The Guardian |date=20 March 2014 |access-date=2 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/faq/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Tubular.net |access-date=26 October 2013}}</ref> Oldfield did everything in his power to make it impossible to make extracts and Virgin returned the favour by barely promoting the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mikeoldfield.org/amarok |title=Amarok |publisher=Dark Star Magazine |access-date=23 May 2020}}</ref>

in February 1991, Oldfield released his final album for Virgin, ''[[Heaven's Open]]'', under the name "Michael Oldfield". It marks the first time he handles all lead vocals. In 2013, Oldfield invited Branson to the opening of St. Andrew's International School of The Bahamas, where two of Oldfield's children were pupils. This was the occasion of the debut of ''Tubular Bells for Schools'', a piano solo adaptation of Oldfield's work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribune242.com/news/2013/oct/21/famous-faces-for-bahamas-debut-of-tubular-bells/ |title=Famous faces for Bahamas debut of Tubular Bells for Schools |publisher=Tribune 242 |date=21 October 2013 |access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref>

===1992–2003: Warner years===
By early 1992, Oldfield had secured Clive Banks as his new manager and had several record label owners listen to his demo of ''[[Tubular Bells II]]'' at his house. Oldfield signed with [[Rob Dickins]] of [[Warner Music Group|WEA Warner]] and recorded the album with [[Trevor Horn]] as producer.<ref name=TS12/> Released in August 1992, the album went to No. 1 in the UK. Its live premiere followed on 4 September at [[Edinburgh Castle]] which was released on home video as ''[[Tubular Bells II Live]]''. Oldfield supported the album with his Tubular Bells II 20th Anniversary Tour in 1992 and 1993, his first concert tour since 1984. By April 1993, the album had sold over three million copies worldwide.<ref name=TI93/>

Oldfield continued to embrace new musical styles, with ''[[The Songs of Distant Earth (album)|The Songs of Distant Earth]]'' (based on [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s [[Songs of Distant Earth|novel of the same name]]) exhibiting a softer new-age sound. In 1994, he also had an [[asteroid]], [[5656 Oldfield]], named after him.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minorplanetcenter.org/iau/special/rocknroll/0005656.html |title=Oldfield 5656 |publisher=[[Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]] |access-date=2 April 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1998_09 |title=Mike Oldfield Interview |publisher=[[BBC Radio 2]] |date=9 September 1998 |access-date=2 April 2008}}</ref>

In 1995, Oldfield continued to embrace new musical styles by producing the [[Celtic music|Celtic]]-themed album ''[[Voyager (Mike Oldfield album)|Voyager]]''. In 1992, Oldfield met [[Luar na Lubre]], a Galician Celtic-folk band (from [[A Coruña]], Spain), with the singer Rosa Cedrón. The band's popularity grew after Oldfield covered their song "O son do ar" ("The sound of the air") on his ''Voyager'' album.

In 1998, Oldfield produced [[Tubular Bells III|the third ''Tubular Bells'' album]] (also premiered at a [[Tubular Bells III Live|concert]], this time in [[Horse Guards Parade]], London), drawing on the [[dance music]] scene at his then new home on the island of [[Ibiza]]. This album was inspired by themes from ''Tubular Bells'', but differed in lacking a clear two-part structure.

During 1999, Oldfield released two albums. The first, ''[[Guitars (Mike Oldfield album)|Guitars]]'', used guitars as the source for all the sounds on the album, including percussion. The second, ''[[The Millennium Bell]]'', consisted of [[pastiche]]s of a number of styles of music that represented various historical periods over the past millennium. The work was [[The Art in Heaven Concert|performed live]] in Berlin for the city's millennium celebrations in 1999–2000.

He added to his repertoire the [[MusicVR]] project, combining his music with a [[virtual reality]]-based computer game. His first work on this project is ''[[Tr3s Lunas]]'' launched in 2002, a virtual game where the player can interact with a world full of new music. This project appeared as a double CD, one with the music, and the other with the [[Tres Lunas (video game)|game]].

In 2002 and 2003, Oldfield re-recorded ''Tubular Bells'' using modern equipment to coincide the 30th anniversary of the original. He had wanted to do it years before but his contract with Virgin kept him from doing so.<ref name=SOS02>{{cite web|url=https://tubular.net/articles/2002_11/Mike-Oldfield-Sound-on-Sound|title=Mike Oldfield - Sound on Sound|date=November 2002|first=Mark|last=Wherry|work=Sound on Sound|access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref> This new version features [[John Cleese]] as the Master of Ceremonies as [[Viv Stanshall]], who spoke on the original, died in the interim. ''[[Tubular Bells 2003]]'' was released in May 2003.

===2004–present: Mercury years===
On 12 April 2004 Oldfield launched his next [[virtual reality]] project, ''[[Maestro (video game)|Maestro]]'', which contains music from the ''Tubular Bells 2003'' album and some new [[chillout]] melodies. The games have since been made available free of charge on Tubular.net.<ref name="tubulararchives"/>

In 2005, Oldfield signed a deal with [[Mercury Records|Mercury Records UK]], who secured the rights to his catalogue when the rights had reverted to himself. Mercury acquired the rights to Oldfield's back catalogue, in July 2007. Oldfield released his first album on the Mercury label, ''[[Light + Shade]]'', in September 2005. It is a double album of music of contrasting mood: relaxed (Light) and upbeat and moody (Shade). In 2006 and 2007, Oldfield headlined the [[Night of the Proms]] tour, consisting of 21 concerts across Europe.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.notp.com/?country=de&menuitem=2 | title=Nokia Night of the Proms 2006 |publisher=[[Night of the Proms]] |access-date=1 June 2006}}</ref> Also in 2007, Oldfield released his autobiography, ''[[Changeling (Mike Oldfield autobiography)|Changeling]]''.<ref name=resolution>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/2007_03 |title=Craft: Mike Oldfield |work=Resolution Magazine |date=March 2007 |access-date=2 April 2008}}</ref>

Oldfield's latest rock-themed album of songs, titled ''[[Man on the Rocks]]'', was released on 3 March 2014 by [[Virgin EMI]]. The album was produced by [[Steve Lipson]]. The album marks a return of Oldfield to a Virgin branded label, through the merger of Mercury Records UK and Virgin Records after Universal Music's purchase of EMI.

In 2015, Oldfield told [[Steve Wright (DJ)|Steve Wright]] on his BBC radio show that a sequel album to ''Tubular Bells'' was in early development, which he aimed to record on analogue equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02r7qr4 |title=Mike Oldfield gives Steve Wright a (tubular) bell from the Bahamas |publisher=BBC Radio 2 |date=12 May 2015 |access-date=21 May 2015}}</ref> Later in 2015, Oldfield revealed that he had started on a sequel to ''Ommadawn''.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/GordenMikefield/status/654968898727505920 |title=Twitter Post |publisher=Mike Oldfield via [[Twitter]] |date=16 October 2015 |access-date=20 January 2016}}</ref> The album, named ''[[Return to Ommadawn]]'', was finished in 2016 and released in January 2017.<ref name="bbc.co.uk"/> It went to No. 4 in the UK.<ref name="RTOChart">{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/date=2017-01-27|title=Official Albums Chart Top 100, 27 January 2017 - 02 February 2017|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref> Oldfield again hinted at a fourth ''Tubular Bells'' album when he posted photos of his new equipment, including a new [[Telecaster]] guitar.<ref name="Facebook290117">{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/MikeOldfieldPublic/permalink/356001801444327/|title=Mike Oldfield's official Facebook fan page|date=29 January 2017|access-date=29 January 2017}}</ref>

==Musicianship==
Although Oldfield considers himself primarily a guitarist, he is also one of popular music's most skilled and diverse multi-instrumentalists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.recordproduction.com/mike-oldfield-interview.html |title=Mike Oldfield video interview |publisher=RecordProduction.com |access-date=15 May 2008}}</ref> His 1970s recordings were characterised by a very broad variety of instrumentation predominantly played by himself, plus assorted guitar sound treatments to suggest other instrumental timbres (such as the bagpipe, mandolin, "Glorfindel" and varispeed guitars on the original ''Tubular Bells'').
During the 1980s Oldfield became expert in the use of digital synthesizers and sequencers (notably the [[Fairlight CMI]]) which began to dominate the sound of his recordings: from the late 1990s onwards, he became a keen user of [[software synthesizer]]s. He has, however, regularly returned to projects emphasising detailed, manually played and part-acoustic instrumentation (such as 1990's ''Amarok'', 1996's ''Voyager'' and 1999's ''Guitars'').

Oldfield has played over forty distinct and different instruments on record, including:

* a wide variety of electric and acoustic six-string guitars and bass guitars (plus [[electric sitar]] and [[guitar synthesizer]]) in a variety of different styles including folk, rock, pop and flamenco and taking in techniques such as bowing
* other fretted instruments ([[banjo]], [[mandolin]], [[bouzouki]], [[ukulele]], [[Chapman Stick]])
* keyboards (piano, assorted electric/electronic organs and synthesizers, [[spinet]])
* electronic instruments ([[Fairlight CMI]] plus other [[sampler (musical instrument)|digital samplers]] and [[Music sequencer|sequencer]]s; assorted drum programs, [[vocoder]], [[software synthesizer]]s)
* wind instruments ([[flageolet]], [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorder]], [[penny whistle|penny]] and [[Low whistle|bass whistle]]s, [[Northumbrian bagpipes]])
* [[free-reed instrument]]s ([[accordion]], [[melodica]])
* [[string instrument]]s (violin, [[harp]], [[psaltery]])
* [[unpitched percussion]] (including [[bodhrán]], African drums, [[timpani]], rhythm sticks, [[tambourine]], [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shaker]], [[cabasa]])
* tuned percussion ([[tubular bells]], [[glockenspiel]], [[marimba]], gong, [[sleigh bell]]s, [[bell tree]], [[Rototoms]], [[Simmons (electronic drum company)|Simmons electronic drums]], [[triangle]])
* [[plucked idiophone]]s ([[kalimba]], [[jaw harp]])
* occasional found instruments (such as [[nutcrackers]])

While generally preferring the sound of guest vocalists, Oldfield has frequently sung both lead and backup parts for his songs and compositions. He has also contributed experimental vocal effects such as fake choirs and the notorious "Piltdown Man" impression on ''Tubular Bells''.

Although recognised as a highly skilled guitarist, Oldfield is self-deprecating about his other instrumental skills, describing them as having been developed out of necessity to perform and record the music he composes. He has been particularly dismissive of his violin-playing and singing abilities.

===Guitars===
Over the years, Oldfield has used a range of guitars. Among the more notable of these are:
; 1963<ref group="Notes">Also quoted as 1961 and 1962.</ref> [[Fender Stratocaster]] : Serial no. L08044, in salmon pink (fiesta red). Used by Oldfield from 1984 (the ''[[Discovery (Mike Oldfield album)|Discovery]]'' album) until 2006 (Night of the Proms, rehearsals in Antwerp). Subsequently, sold for £30,000 at Chandler Guitars.
; 1989 [[PRS Guitars|PRS]] Artist Custom 24 : In amber, used by Oldfield from the late 1980s to the present day.
; 1966 [[Fender Telecaster]] : Serial no. 180728, in blonde. Previously owned by [[Marc Bolan]], this was the only electric guitar used on ''Tubular Bells''.<ref name=roland>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1999_06 |title=Interview with Mike Oldfield |publisher=[[Roland Corporation|Roland]] PowerOn magazine (Issue 4) |date=6 June 1999 |access-date=1 April 2008}}</ref> The guitar was unsold at auction by [[Bonhams]] in 2007, 2008 and 2009 at estimated values of, respectively, £25,000–35,000, £10,000–15,000 and £8,000–12,000;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15242/lot/391/ |title=Lot 391 Mike Oldfield's Fender Telecaster, used to record the album 'Tubular Bells', Film and Rock & Roll Memorabilia Auction 15242 |date=20 June 2007 |publisher=[[Bonhams]] |access-date=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/15765/lot/361/ |title=Lot 361 Mike Oldfield's Fender Telecaster, used to record the album 'Tubular Bells', Entertainment Memorabilia Auction 15765 |date=15 January 2008 |publisher=[[Bonhams]] |access-date=21 April 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bonhams.com/auctions/16905/lot/277/ |title=Lot 277 Mike Oldfield's Fender Telecaster, used to record the album 'Tubular Bells', Entertainment Memorabilia Auction 16905 |date=16 December 2009 |publisher=[[Bonhams]] |access-date=21 April 2012}}</ref> Oldfield has since sold it and donated the £6500 received to the charity [[SANE (charity)|SANE]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sane.org.uk/resources/media_centre/archive/archive_show_news/184 |title=Historic guitar in safe hands of SANE supporter |publisher=[[SANE (charity)|SANE]] |date=25 February 2011 |access-date=17 August 2014}}</ref>
; Various [[Gibson Les Paul]], [[Zemaitis Guitars|Zemaitis]] and [[Gibson SG|SG]] guitars : Used extensively by Oldfield in the 1970s and 80s. The most notable Gibson guitar Oldfield favoured in this time period was a 1962 [[Gibson SG Junior|Les Paul/SG Junior]] model, which was his primary guitar for the recording of [[Ommadawn]], among other works. Oldfield is also known to have owned and used an [[Gibson L6-S|L6-S]] during that model's production run in the mid-1970s. On occasion, Oldfield was also seen playing a black [[Gibson Les Paul Custom|Les Paul Custom]], an early reissue model built around 1968.

Oldfield used a modified [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] GP8 effects processor in conjunction with his PRS Artist to get many of his heavily [[Distortion (music)|overdrive]]n guitar sounds from the ''[[Earth Moving]]'' album onwards.<ref name=roland/> Oldfield has also been using [[guitar synthesizer]]s since the mid-1980s, using a 1980s Roland GR-300/G-808 type system, then a 1990s Roland GK2 equipped red PRS Custom 24 (sold in 2006) with a Roland VG8,<ref name=roland/> and most recently a [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] [[Variax]].

Oldfield has an unusual playing style, using fingers and long right-hand fingernails and different ways of creating vibrato: a "very fast side-to-side vibrato" and "violinist's vibrato".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1995_06 |title=Gareth Randall Interviews Mike Oldfield |date=1 June 1995 |access-date=1 April 2008}}</ref> Oldfield has stated that his playing style originates from his musical roots playing folk music and the bass guitar.<ref name=changeling/>

===Keyboards===
Over the years, Oldfield has owned and used a vast number of synthesizers and other keyboard instruments.<!--Add some further examples if you wish--> In the 1980s, he composed the score for the film ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' on a [[Fairlight CMI]].<ref name=roland/> Some examples of keyboard and synthesised instruments which Oldfield has made use of include [[Sequential Circuits Prophet-5]]s (notably on [[Platinum (Mike Oldfield album)|''Platinum'']] and [[The Killing Fields (album)|''The Killing Fields'']]), Roland JV-1080/JV-2080 units (1990s), a [[Korg M1]] (as seen in the "[[Innocent (Mike Oldfield song)|Innocent]]" video), a [[Clavia]] [[Nord Lead]] and [[Steinway & Sons|Steinway]] pianos. In recent years, he has also made use of software synthesis products, such as [[Native Instruments]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.net/discography/LightAndShade.shtml |title=''Light & Shade'' |publisher=Tubular.net |access-date=28 September 2010}}</ref>

===Lead vocalists===
Oldfield has occasionally sung himself on his records and live performances, sometimes using a vocoder as a resource. It is not unusual for him to collaborate with diverse singers and to hold auditions before deciding the most appropriate for a particular song or album. Featured lead vocalists who have collaborated with him include:

===Recording===
Oldfield has self-recorded and produced many of his albums, and played the majority of the featured instruments, largely at his home studios. In the 1990s and 2000s he mainly used [[Digital audio workstation|DAWs]] such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Logic Pro|Logic]], [[Avid Technology|Avid]] [[Pro Tools]] and [[Steinberg]] [[Nuendo]] as recording suites.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://tubular.net/articles/1995_02 |title=Tubular Worlds |magazine=Sound on Sound |date=February 1995 |access-date=1 April 2008}}</ref> For composing orchestral music Oldfield has been quoted as using the software notation program [[Sibelius (software)|Sibelius]]<ref name=resolution/> running on Apple [[Macintosh]]es.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tubular.eu.org/mike_mac_format0408.jpg |title=I use my Mac for...
