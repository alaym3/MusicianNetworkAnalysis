'''Tyler Gregory Okonma''' (born March 6, 1991), better known as '''Tyler, the Creator''', is an American rapper and record producer.<!-- DO NOT ADD NON-NOTABLE OCCUPATIONS, ONLY ENTERPRISES HE IS FAMOUS FOR. -->

Following a large contribution to [[Odd Future]]'s early work, Tyler released his debut solo [[mixtape]] ''[[Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)|Bastard]]'' in 2009. After releasing his debut studio album ''[[Goblin (album)|Goblin]]'' via [[XL Recordings]] in April 2011, he signed a joint deal with [[RED Distribution]] and [[Sony Music Entertainment]] for himself and his label [[Odd Future Records]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rob Markman |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1662692/ofwgkta-odd-future-sign-record-deal.jhtml |title=Odd Future Record Deal Is Complete, Manager Confirms |publisher=[[MTV]] |date=April 26, 2011 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref> With his gritty, [[horrorcore]]-influenced earlier releases, Tyler was often criticized for his use of [[Homophobia|homophobic]] and [[misogynistic]] slurs in his lyrics. He released the albums ''[[Wolf (Tyler, the Creator album)|Wolf]]'' (2013) and ''[[Cherry Bomb (album)|Cherry Bomb]]'' (2015), the latter of which was considered to be a contrast from his previous releases as he experimented with melody-focused and [[jazz]]-fused sounds. Tyler's following albums, ''[[Flower Boy]]'' (2017), ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]'' (2019) and ''[[Call Me If You Get Lost]]'' (2021), were all released to widespread critical acclaim, with the latter two also debuting at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

A series of three commercials for [[Mountain Dew]] directed by Okonma created controversy in May 2013, accused of using "racial stereotypes" and "making light of violence against women". In the spots an energy drink-loving goat character called "Felicia the Goat" is consecutively being "[[scapegoating|scapegoated]]" in a diner, in prison, and on the road. During the 60-second ad in prison, a battered white woman on crutches examines a police line-up consisting of several African-American men and one goat, while the goat antagonizes the woman. [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]] professor and social critic [[Boyce Watkins]] stated that the ad was "arguably the most racist commercial in history." [[PepsiCo]] pulled the ad and apologized. Okonma released a statement claiming that the ad was not meant to "spark a controversy about race" and that "it was simply an, again, admittedly absurd story that was never meant to be taken seriously."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/tyler-the-creators-controversial-mountain-dew-ad-pulled-off-the-air-20130501 |title=Tyler, the Creator's Controversial Mountain Dew Ad Pulled Off the Air |work=Rolling Stone |date=May 1, 2013|access-date=May 3, 2013 |first=RJ |last=Cubarrubia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bet.com/news/music/2013/05/03/tyler-the-creator-responds-to-ad-pull.html |title=Tyler, the Creator Responds to Mountain Dew Ad Pull |publisher=BET |date= May 3, 2013|access-date=May 3, 2013 |first=Sia |last=Barnes}}</ref>

On March 15, 2014, Okonma was arrested in [[Austin, Texas]] for inciting a riot after telling fans to push their way past security guards at his [[South by Southwest]] performance. Due to this incident, Tyler faced up to one year in prison and a $4000 fine.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rapper Tyler, The Creator arrested at South By Southwest

These charges were later dropped.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ulloa|first=Jazmine|title=As rapper's riot charge is dropped, legal experts question arrest|url=https://www.statesman.com/news/20160816/as-rappers-riot-charge-is-dropped-legal-experts-question-arrest|access-date=2020-06-26|website=Austin American-Statesman|language=en}}</ref>

On August 26, 2015, Okonma revealed that he had been banned from visiting the United Kingdom for three to five years, which forced him to cancel a string of tour dates supporting the ''Cherry Bomb'' album, including the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals]]. The reason for the ban comes from lyrics dating back to 2009. His manager Christian Clancy said they were informed of the ban via a letter from then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]].<ref name="auto" /> May cited lyrics from the mixtape ''[[Bastard (Tyler, the Creator mixtape)|Bastard]]'' as the reason for the ban, although Okonma had toured multiple times in the UK since its release.<ref name="auto1" /><ref name="ITV News" /> Okonma later said that he felt he had been treated like a terrorist and implied that the ban was racially motivated, stating that "they did not like the fact that their children were idolizing a black man."<ref name="auto2" /> According to the BBC, it is believed the ban was lifted in February 2019,{{r|BBC Rowdy}} concurring with a scheduled performance in London to promote his fifth studio album, ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]''. However, this show was forcibly cancelled by police due to safety concerns: the venue was claimed to be "overcrowded" and "too rowdy."<ref name="BBC Rowdy">{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-48321716 |title='Rowdy' crowd stops rapper's surprise gig |work=BBC News |date=2019-05-18}}</ref>
