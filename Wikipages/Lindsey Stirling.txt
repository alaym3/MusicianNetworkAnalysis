== Early life ==
Stirling is the middle child of three daughters of Stephen and Diane Stirling. Stirling describes her childhood as being raised in a modest household and stated "I would not trade my humble childhood years for anything else."<ref name="mormon.org" /> Due to her family's financial limitations, her parents could only afford to find a violin teacher who would give her half lessons. Although they were told by instructors that "a child isn't going to learn how to play in 15 minutes a week", her parents persisted, and at the age of five she began taking violin lessons.<ref name=byu>{{Cite web|url=https://magazine.byu.edu/article/violin-with-a-high-kick/|title=Lindsey Stirling: Violin with a High Kick|access-date=March 16, 2019}}</ref>

Living in [[Gilbert, Arizona]], Stirling attended Greenfield Junior High, and at age sixteen,<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Ramey |first=Corinne |date=April 2013 |title=Lindsey Stirling: Flights of Fantasy |url=http://www.allthingsstrings.com/News/Interviews-Profiles/Lindsey-Stirling-Flights-of-Fantasy |magazine=[[Strings (magazine)|Strings]] |issue=216 |pages=38–42 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210042813/http://www.allthingsstrings.com/News/Interviews-Profiles/Lindsey-Stirling-Flights-of-Fantasy |archive-date=December 10, 2014}}</ref> Stirling attended [[Mesquite High School (Gilbert, Arizona)|Mesquite High School]] and joined four friends in a rock band called Stomp on Melvin. As part of her experience with the group, Stirling wrote a solo violin rock song, and her performance helped her to win the state title of Arizona's [[Distinguished Young Women|Junior Miss]] and claim the Spirit Award in the [[America's Junior Miss]] Finals competition.<ref name=JuniorMiss/> Stirling was also a member of Charley Jenkins Band for about a year.<ref name=TourVlog/>

From a young age, Stirling had a fascination for dance, and desired to take both dancing and violin lessons. In an interview with ''[[NewMediaRockstars]]'', she said, "...ever since I was a kid, I've always wished that I could dance, but my parents said, 'You [can] choose violin or you [can] choose dance, but we can't afford both', and I chose violin. So this is kind of a fulfillment&nbsp;– it's funny to say, but this is something I've always wanted to do."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://newmediarockstars.com/2013/10/lindsey-stirling-talks-competing-on-danceons-dance-showdown-season-3-new-album-interview/|title=Lindsey Stirling Talks Competing on DanceOn's 'Dance Showdown' Season 3, New Album|last=Kliva|first=Jeff|date=October 30, 2013|work=New Media Rockstars|access-date=December 5, 2014|publisher=[[NewMediaRockstars]]}}</ref>

==Career==
===2010–2012: ''America's Got Talent'' and debut studio album===
In 2010, at the age of 23, Stirling was a quarter-finalist on [[America's Got Talent (season 5)|season five]] of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', where she was described as a "hip hop violinist".<ref name="hercampus" /><ref name="nbc1" /> She impressed the judges on ''America's Got Talent'', not only by mixing hip-hop, pop, and classical music on the violin, but by incorporating dancing with playing the violin, which she also does on her tours and official music videos. On a live-chat, Stirling explained, "It is very unnatural to dance while playing the violin. I had to practice so hard to learn how to do it, but now it is part of my expression and it comes naturally. I have to know a song perfectly before I can even begin to move. Once I know a song really well, I can then have fun dancing."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/who-lindsey-stirling-5-things-know-about-violinist-who-performed-during-paul-walker-1927347|title=Who is Lindsey Stirling? 5 Things To Know About The Violinist Who Performed During The Paul Walker Billboard Awards Tribute|date=May 18, 2015|newspaper=International Business Times|access-date=November 12, 2016}}</ref> Not only in her performances, but also with her music, dancing made a huge impact: "I loved dance music so I started with that and wrote 'Transcendence', 'Electric Daisy', and 'Spontaneous Me'."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reddit.com/user/lindsey_stirling |title=Overview for lindsey_stirling |work=Reddit.com |access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref>

Stirling's performances were dubbed "electrifying" by the judges, and won the acclaim of the audience, but after she attempted to step up the dance level in her quarter-final performance, judge [[Piers Morgan]] buzzed her. He told her: "You're not untalented, but you're not good enough, I don't think, to get away with flying through the air and trying to play the violin at the same time."<ref name="SanDiegoUnionTribune1">{{cite news|last1=Varga|first1=George|title=Lindsey Stirling bows way to the top|url=http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2014/may/13/lindsey-stirling-interview/|access-date=March 27, 2016|work=[[U-T San Diego]]|date=May 13, 2014}}</ref> [[Sharon Osbourne]] commented: "You need to be in a group. ...

It was painful, and a bit humiliating; however, I had to relearn where it was that I drew my strength."<ref name="www.independent.com" /><ref name="lindseystirling.com" /> Stirling decided to continue to embrace her unique style of performance, promoting herself on the Internet. In a 2012 interview she remarked: "A lot of people have told me along the way that my style and the music I do ... is unmarketable. But the only reason I'm successful is because I have stayed true to myself."<ref name=byu/>

Shortly after her performance on ''America's Got Talent'', cinematographer [[Devin Graham]] contacted her in hopes of collaborating on a YouTube video together. They agreed to shoot a music video for her song, "Spontaneous Me." It was filmed the week of May 9, 2011. The video boosted Stirling's popularity, and she began making music videos for her YouTube channel regularly. Stirling's YouTube channel, Lindseystomp, which she created in 2007 and which is named after her first band Stomp on Melvin, is the main repository for her music videos. During 2011, the channel rapidly gained popularity and has over 3&nbsp;billion total views and over 12 million subscribers, {{As of|2018|11|lc=on}}.<ref name="YouTubeStats" /> Her music is featured on [[Pandora Radio|Pandora]], [[Spotify]], and [[Last.FM]].<ref name="last.fm" /> Stirling also created a second YouTube channel, LindseyTime, in September 2012, in which she posts videos related to her life, [[video blog|vlogs]], behind-the-scenes content, etc.

On April 22, 2013, it was announced that [[Lady Gaga]]'s manager ([[Troy Carter (music industry)|Troy Carter]]) signed a deal with Stirling after being impressed by her rise in the media. "By looking at the numbers, automatically you could see this girl knew how to move the needle and understood YouTube was a venue to engage fans both online and offline," Carter said. Stirling, who had previously refused to work with other management companies explained her new deal with Carter: "But with Atom Factory, they were up to date on current things and trying new stuff all the time, and I felt so creatively alive when I met with them."<ref>{{cite journal |url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1559095/dubstep-violinist-lindsey-stirling-inks-deal-with-lady-gagas-manager |title= Dubstep Violinist Lindsey Stirling Inks Deal With Lady Gaga's Manager |journal= [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |date= April 22, 2013 |access-date= December 5, 2014}}</ref>
