'''Ralph Zachary Richard''' (born September 8, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] singer-songwriter and poet. His music is a combination of [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] musical styles.

==Biography==
Zachary Richard  began his musical career at the age of 8, as soprano in the Bishop's Boys Choir at Saint John's Cathedral in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]. He attended Cathedral High School and [[Tulane University]], graduating summa cum laude in 1972.

Richard has recorded Cajun and [[zydeco]] music for over 45 years.  He has recorded sixteen studio albums of which five were declared gold albums in Canada with a double platinum (''Cap Enragé'').  Although recording in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]], Richard's career has been notably Francophone. He has been awarded 5 Prix Félix (Quebec music award named after [[Félix Leclerc]]).  He is an Officer in the Ordre des Arts et Lettres de la République Française and a member of the Ordre des Francophones d'Amérique.  In 1980, he was awarded the Prix de la Jeune Chanson Française by the French Minister of Culture.

In addition to his musical works, Richard published works include three volumes of poetry and three children's books. ''Faire Récolte'' earned the Prix Champlain (Quebec) in 1998 and ''Feu'' received the Roland Gasparic Award ([[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]) in 2002.

Richard has collaborated on several television documentary projects including ''Against the Tide, the Story of the Cajun people of Louisiana'' (producer and music director) which received the Best Historical Documentary prize in 2000 awarded by the National Educational Television Association.  The French version, ''Contre vents, contre marées'' received the Prix Historia the following year.  Zachary was narrator and musical director of ''Migrations'', ''Vu du Large'', ''Coeurs Batailleurs'', and most recently ''Kouchibouguac, l'histoire de Jackie Vautour et des Expropriés''.

In 2009, he was made an honorary Member of the [[Order of Canada]] "for his contributions as an author, composer, singer and poet, and for his important role in defending and promoting the French language and the "Cadian" and Acadian identity".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gg.ca/en|title=The Governor General of Canada|first=Office of the Secretary to the Governor|last=General|website=The Governor General of Canada|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>

In August 2010, following the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]] and the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill]],  Zachary Richard released an album titled ''Le grand gosier'' featuring a hip-hop version of "Le grand gosier" by singer-songwriter [[Rocky McKeon]] using the original chorus in [[Louisiana French]] and adding verses by [[Samian (rapper)|Samian]] in [[French language|French]] and [[Emrical]] in [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]].  The chorus was performed by Zachary Richard, Rocky McKeon and a slew of well-known Canadian francophone artists, notably [[Bobby Bazini]], [[Daniel Lavoie]], [[Marc Hervieux]], [[Richard Séguin]] and [[Luc de Larochellière]].<ref>[http://7jours.canoe.ca/musique/nouvelles/2010/08/18/15065876-7j.html] {{dead link|date=February 2020}}</ref>  The album also includes a version of "Le grand gosier" with verses solely in [[Algonquin language|Algonquin]], and another version with verses solely in [[Haitian Creole language|Haitian Creole]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zacharyrichard.com/english/grand_gosier.html|title=Zachary Richard - Le Grand Gosier|website=Zacharyrichard.com|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zacharyrichard.com/lyrics/grand_gosier_en.html|title=Zachary Richard - Le Grand Gosier|website=Zacharyrichard.com|access-date=February 17, 2020}}</ref>
