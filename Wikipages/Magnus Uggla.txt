'''Per Allan Magnus Claësson Uggla''' (pronounced {{IPA-sv|pæːr ˈǎlːan ˈmǎŋːnɵs ˈklɑ̌ːsɔn ˈɵ̂ɡːla|}}; born 18 June 1954) is a Swedish artist, composer, actor, and occasional radio host. He is known for his [[satire|satirical]] lyrics.  

Uggla was born in Stockholm. He was the lead singer of the [[hard rock]] band JUSO (later renamed Alexander Lucas) before going solo in the early 1970s. Their influences were [[Black Sabbath]], [[The Groundhogs]] and [[Alice Cooper]], among others. Uggla's first two [[glam rock|glam-]] and [[art rock]]-inspired albums ''[[Om Bobbo Viking]]'' and ''[[Livets teater]]''ˈ did not sell well, the first only about 500 copies in Sweden and ''Livets teater'' even less. But his departure from glam rock with the [[punk rock|punk]] and [[hard rock]] inspired ''[[Va ska man ta livet av sig för när man ändå inte får höra snacket efteråt]]'' gained him much popularity and the album sold about 150,000 copies. In the 1970s, several music magazines gave Magnus the name "The Swedish [[Ian Hunter (singer)|Ian Hunter]]". In 1979, he was one of the members in Magnus Uggla Band. [[Povel Ramel]] awarded him the [[Povel_Ramel#Karamelodiktstipendiet|Karamelodiktstipendiet]] in 1991.

Uggla's solo influences includes [[Karl Gerhard]], [[David Bowie]], [[The Clash]], [[Marc Bolan]], [[Wendy Carlos]] and [[Mott the Hoople]]. In an interview with [[Aftonbladet]], Uggla said that the Clash "was a really good band" and also created the song "Du ska va' glad" after he saw them perform at [[Gröna Lund]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aftonbladet.se/a/l1VyMG|title=Ugglas favoriter|last=Fjällborg|first=Karolina|date=5 July 2002|website=[[Aftonbladet]]|language=sv|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328230530/http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/a/l1VyMG/ugglas-favoriter|archive-date=28 March 2020|access-date=28 March 2020}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
*Uggla participated in the fourth semi-final of [[Melodifestivalen]] 2007 with the song "[[För kung och fosterland]]", competing for the opportunity to represent Sweden in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|Eurovision Song Contest]] in Helsinki, Finland. On February 24, 2007, Uggla performed his song, and advanced to the Second Chance round the following Saturday, where he lost to [[Sonja Aldén]] in the last round of voting. Earlier that week, he had received complaints about the lyrics of the song which contain a line that could be interpreted as degrading to Polish people, but the Swedish [[Chancellor of Justice]] decided not to try this as a violation of the [[hate speech]] act.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_14781129.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311064950/http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/inrikes/did_14781129.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=March 11, 2007 |title=Uggla's shady Pole not criminal |publisher=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=March 8, 2007 |language=sv }}</ref>
