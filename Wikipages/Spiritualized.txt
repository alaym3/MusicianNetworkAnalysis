'''Spiritualized''' are an English [[space rock]] band formed in 1990 in [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] by [[Jason Pierce]] (often known as J. Spaceman), formerly of [[Spacemen 3]]. After several line up-changes, in 1999, the band centered on Pierce (vocals, guitar), John Coxon (guitars, keyboards), Doggen Foster (guitar), Kevin Bales (drums and percussion) and Tom Edwards (percussion and keyboards) with revolving bassists. The band’s current bassist, Thomas Wayne, has been playing with the band since 2009.

Spiritualized have released eight studio albums. The best known and most critically acclaimed of these is 1997's ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space]]'', which ''[[NME]]'' magazine named as their [[NME album of the year|Album of the Year]], beating other critically acclaimed albums such as Radiohead's ''[[OK Computer]]'' and The Verve's ''[[Urban Hymns]]''.<ref name="1997 NME Albums">{{cite web |title=NME Albums of the Year, 1997 |url=http://www.rocklistmusic.co.uk/1997.html |publisher=rocklistmusic.co.uk |access-date=11 August 2009}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation: 1990–1991===
Following a breakdown in relations between Spacemen 3 co-frontmen [[Peter Kember]] and [[Jason Pierce]], the group's bassist [[Will Carruthers]], drummer [[Jonny Mattock]], and guitarist [[Mark Refoy]] were asked by Pierce to form a new group alongside local friend Steve Evans, subsequently calling themselves Spiritualized. The band took their name from an adaptation of the text on the back label of a bottle of [[Pernod]]. Due to formation from a majority of [[Spacemen 3]] members, a technical clause meant that Spiritualized had to maintain the Spacemen 3 recording contract with [[Dedicated Records]].

The first Spiritualized release, in 1990, was a cover of [[The Troggs]]' "Anyway That You Want Me"; the record heralded the official split of Spacemen 3 following contractual wrangles over the band's name and its use in Spiritualized-related promotional material (initial copies of "Anyway That You Want Me" came with a Spacemen 3 logo on the sleeve). 

===First releases: 1992–1998===
Evans was replaced on keyboards by Pierce's then-girlfriend [[Kate Radley]] for the follow-up single, "Run"/"I Want You". A number of singles followed, before the band, in early 1992, released their first LP ''[[Lazer Guided Melodies]]'', which had been recorded in Rugby over the previous two years. The band embarked on a tour with [[The Jesus & Mary Chain]] after the release of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/1992/legit/reviews/jesus-mary-chain-curve-spiritualized-medicine-1200430899/|title=Jesus & Mary Chain; Curve; Spiritualized; Medicine|first=Troy J.|last=Augusto|date=24 November 1992|website=variety.com|access-date=3 April 2018}}</ref> A second album, ''[[Pure Phase]]'', was released in 1995, and a third, ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space]]'' emerged in 1997 to critical acclaim and commercial success. Following promotional activity for ''Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space'', [[Gregg Hale (musician)|Gregg Hale]] left the band on good terms, but Sean Cook, Damon Reece and Michael Mooney threatened a strike in protest over low salaries and appearance fees. New contracts of employment were drawn up between Pierce and the musicians, and the same contracts were then used to fire them (to general disbelief by the music press at the time). In response, Cook, Reece and Mooney formed [[Lupine Howl]].

===Development in sound: 1999–2010===
Retaining only keyboardist [[Thighpaulsandra]] (keyboards), Jason Pierce then debuted a new line up of Spiritualized, introducing classical percussionist Tom Edwards and former [[Julian Cope]] string arranger Martin Schellard on bass guitar. Completing the new Spiritualized line-up were guitarist Doggen of [[Brain Donor]] and the [[Julian Cope]] band, [[Richard Warren (musician)|Richard Warren]] and drummer Kevin 'Kevlar' Bales, who is also a member of [[Brain Donor]].<ref name="Buckley2003">{{cite book|author=Peter Buckley|title=The Rough Guide to Rock|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fie47qSuTsoC&pg=PA2026|year=2003|publisher=Rough Guides|isbn=978-1-85828-457-6|pages=2026–}}</ref> Jonny Aitken stepped in on drums for the recording of ''Amazing Grace'' while Kevin Bales was recovering from illness.  Chris Davis of [[Six By Seven]] & [[Spotlight Kid (band)|Spotlight Kid]] also stepped in for Kevin for two major festival appearances. ''[[Let It Come Down (Spiritualized album)|Let It Come Down]]'' included over 120 musicians.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20011122023818/http://chartattack.com/damn/2001/09/2501.cfm "CD REVIEWS: The Charlatans UK, Spiritualized, The Watchmen and many more"]. ''Chart Attack'', September 25, 2001</ref> ''[[Amazing Grace (Spiritualized album)|Amazing Grace]]'' favoured a more stripped down sound with the gospel, blues, and soul influences even more dominant than before. On 15 June 1997, Spiritualized became the last band to play at Factory Records' Manchester nightclub [[The Haçienda]].

After several years of work and Pierce's serious illness in July 2005,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/spiritualized/20504 |title=Spiritualized Star Hospitalised  |work=NME |date=21 July 2005 |access-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> the album, ''[[Songs in A&E]]'' was released on 26 May 2008 in the UK, and on 27 May 2008 in the US. The first single from the 18-track album was "Soul on Fire". The release was backed by an Electric Mainlines UK tour which began in May.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/spiritualized/31174 |title=Nme.com/news |work=NME |date=17 September 2007 |access-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> Pierce has also scored [[Harmony Korine]]'s 2008 film ''[[Mister Lonely]]''. In October and December 2009 the band performed 1997's "Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space" live in its entirety as part of the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]]-curated [[Don't Look Back (concert series)|Don't Look Back]] series.

===Recent releases: 2011–present===
After more than two years in the making, while Pierce was undergoing experimental chemotherapy for a liver disease, and including a year long period of mixing, ''[[Sweet Heart Sweet Light]]'' was released in April 2012, on [[Double Six Records]] and [[Fat Possum]] in North America. The band had already played some of this new material over the past 3 years but not much else was known about the content of the album. The album cover, an octagon surrounding the word "Huh?" on a plain white background, is a reference to the working title of the album. In an interview regarding the new release it was revealed that the album would "embrace" more poppy songs compared to previous albums. In the same interview, Jason Pierce also said that the album was partly inspired by the experiences of performing "Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space" live in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/spiritualized/51893 |title=Jason Pierce 'living in the studio' to record new Spiritualized album  |work=NME |date=7 July 2010 |access-date=31 August 2011}}</ref> In 2013, Jeremy McMahan ([[Dirty Blood]], [[C is for Cookie]]) was brought in to some sessions to play bass.

''[[And Nothing Hurt]]'' is the band's eighth studio album released on 7 September 2018 through [[Bella Union]] in the United Kingdom and [[Fat Possum Records]] in the United States, and is the band's first album in six years. The album was announced on 11 June 2018, along with the release of the album's first singles, "I'm Your Man" and "A Perfect Miracle" <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/spiritualized-ready-first-lp-in-six-years-and-nothing-hurt-629442/|title=Spiritualized Ready First LP in Six Years 'And Nothing Hurt'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=11 June 2018|access-date=1 September 2018|last=Kreps|first=Daniel}}</ref> and was produced by [[Jason Pierce]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/arts/music/spiritualized-jason-pierce-and-nothing-hurt.html|title=Jason Pierce Struggled to Make a New Spiritualized Album.

On 2 November 2021, the band announced their ninth studio album, ''Everything Was Beautiful'', slated for release on 25 February 2022 through Bella Union/[[PIAS Recordings]].<ref>https://www.spin.com/2021/11/spiritualized-announce-ninth-studio-record-everything-was-beautiful/</ref> The seven-track album was previewed by a single called "Always Together With You", which is a reworked version of a song from 2014 which was originally heard in demo form.

==Musical style==
The band's sound has been labelled as [[space rock]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/spiritualized-mn0000746731/biography | title=Spiritualized | publisher=[[AllMusic]] | access-date=30 July 2015}}</ref> [[neo-psychedelia]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tinymixtapes.com/music-review/elliott-smith-basement-hill?desktop | title=Elliott Smith – From A Basement on the Hill | publisher=[[Tiny Mix Tapes]] | access-date=30 July 2015}}</ref> [[art rock]],<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/album-review-spiritualized-sweet-heart-sweet-light-article-1.1066078 | title=Album review: Spiritualized, 'Sweet Heart, Sweet Light' | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York | access-date=30 July 2015}}</ref> [[experimental rock]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/190967-this-is-our-new-song-the-bends-and-the-reformation-of-alternative-ro/ | title='The Bends' and the Reformation of Alternative Rock | work=[[PopMatters]] | access-date=30 July 2015}}</ref> and [[garage rock]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.popmatters.com/review/spiritualized-amazing/ | title=Spiritualized – Amazing Grace | work=[[PopMatters]] | access-date=30 July 2015}}</ref>

The musical style of Spiritualized relies heavily on sustained '[[Pedal point|pedal]]' notes and [[Drone (music)|drone]]s. ''[[Lazer Guided Melodies]]'' and ''[[Pure Phase]]'' incorporate elements of the [[shoegazing]] style, drones and tremolo. The landmark "Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space" saw the influence of African-American [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[blues]] beginning to show, while "walls of sound" modelled after the production styles of [[Phil Spector]] and [[Brian Wilson]] also made their presence felt.
