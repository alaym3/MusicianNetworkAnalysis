== Early life ==
Blake Tollison Shelton was born in [[Ada, Oklahoma]], to Dorothy, a beauty salon owner, and Richard Shelton, a used car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle.<ref name="Music Index">{{cite book |title= Shelton, Blake |publisher=Encyclopedia of Popular Music}}</ref> By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state.<ref name="allmusic"/> On November 13, 1990, his older brother Richie Shelton was killed in an automobile accident at the age of 24.<ref name="Proquest1">{{cite news |title= Blake Shelton Names Entertainer of the Year at Country Music Awards |last=Talbott |first=Chris |publisher=Valley News}}</ref> After graduating from high school at 17, he moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to pursue a singing career. There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by [[Bobby Braddock]] to obtain a production contract with [[Sony Music]].<ref name="AutoRD-1"/>

== Music career ==
=== 2001–2006: Beginnings ===
[[File:Blake Shelton.jpg|thumb|right|Shelton performing at the Crawford County Fair in Meadville, PA, in August 2005]] Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled "[[I Wanna Talk About Me]]" as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by [[Toby Keith]], whose version was a number 1 single.<ref name="rap"/>

Instead, Giant released "[[Austin (song)|Austin]]" as Shelton's debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company [[Warner Bros. Records]]. "Austin" became Shelton's first number-one hit on the ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton's [[Blake Shelton (album)|self-titled debut album]], which was produced by songwriter [[Bobby Braddock]]. It also produced the Top 20 hits "[[All Over Me (Blake Shelton song)|All Over Me]]", which Shelton co-wrote with [[Earl Thomas Conley]] and Mike Pyle, and "[[Ol' Red]]".<ref name="allmusic"/> Although Shelton's rendition of "Ol' Red" was not a major radio hit, he considers it his [[signature song]], and it has become popular in [[concert]].<ref name="AutoRD-3"/> The album received a platinum certification from the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/?tab_active=default-award&ar=Blake+Shelton&ti=#search_section |title=Gold & Platinum |publisher=RIAA |access-date=March 14, 2017}}</ref>

The album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of [[Allmusic]], who called "Austin" "tremendously imaginative" and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley.<ref name="AutoRD-4"/> ''[[Country Standard Time]]'' was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the "album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market".<ref name="AutoRD-5"/>

Shelton's second album, ''The Dreamer'', was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, "The Baby", reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles ("Heavy Liftin'" and "Playboys of the Southwestern World", respectively) only reached No.32 and No.&nbsp;24, ''The Dreamer'' earned gold certification as well. He, along with [[Andy Griggs]] and [[Montgomery Gentry]], sang guest vocals on [[Tracy Byrd]]'s mid-2003 single "[[The Truth About Men (song)|The Truth About Men]]". ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill'' was the title of Shelton's third studio album, released in 2004.<ref name="allmusic"/> Its lead-off single, the [[Harley Allen]] co-write "When Somebody Knows You That Well", peaked at No.37 on the country charts, while the follow-up "Some Beach" became his third No.1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty's 1988 single "Goodbye Time".<ref name="cw"/> Both this cover and its followup, "Nobody but Me", reached Top Ten for Shelton as well. As with his first album, ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill'' was certified platinum. Accompanying the album's release was a video collection entitled ''Blake Shelton's Barn & Grill: A Video Collection''.<ref name="allmusic"/>

On December 18, 2005, several of Shelton's songs, including "Nobody but Me", appeared on the TV movie ''[[The Christmas Blessing]]'', starring [[Neil Patrick Harris]], [[Rebecca Gayheart]], [[Angus T. Jones]], and [[Rob Lowe]]. Shelton had a small role at the end of the movie, playing himself at a [[benefit concert]], singing "Nobody but Me".

=== 2006–2011: ''Pure BS'' and ''Startin' Fires'' ===
[[File:BlakeSheltonApr10.jpg|thumb|Shelton at the 45th Annual Academy of Country Music Awards]]
Shelton released his fourth studio album, ''Pure BS'', in early 2007.<ref name="allmusic"/> Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by [[Bobby Braddock]], Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and [[Paul Worley]] as producers for this album. Its first two singles—"[[Don't Make Me]]" and "[[The More I Drink]]"—were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No.&nbsp;19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition ''[[Nashville Star]]'', and later on ''[[Clash of the Choirs]]''.

''Pure BS'' was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Bublé's hit single "Home". This cover, released in early 2008 as the album's third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.<ref name="AutoRD-6"/>

"Home" was followed in August 2008 by the single "She Wouldn't Be Gone", his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. "She Wouldn't Be Gone" is the lead-off to Shelton's fifth studio album, ''Startin' Fires,'' which has also produced the single "I'll Just Hold On." This album also includes "Bare Skin Rug," a duet with Lambert.<ref name="AutoRD-7"/> It was produced by [[Scott Hendricks]], except for one track which was produced by Brent Rowan, and another ("I Don't Care", which carried over from ''Pure BS'') was produced by Braddock.<ref name="cst"/> After "I'll Just Hold On" fell off the chart in October 2009, Blake Shelton released a duet with [[Trace Adkins]] titled "Hillbilly Bone". It was the lead single on Shelton's EP, ''Hillbilly Bone'', released on March 2, 2010, through [[Reprise Records]] Nashville. After "Hillbilly Bone" reached No. 1 in February, came the August release of "All About Tonight", the lead-off single to his EP of the same name. In September, he released the second single from ''All About Tonight'', "Who Are You When I'm Not Looking", his 18th single release. He released his first greatest hits album, ''[[Loaded: The Best of Blake Shelton]]'' in November 2010.

Shelton was invited to join the [[Grand Ole Opry]] during the September 28, 2010, "Country Comes Home" concert celebrating reopening of the Grand Ole Opry House after the [[2010 Tennessee floods|Cumberland River flooded the Opry House in May 2010]]. The formal invitation was extended on his Twitter account and was announced by Opry star Trace Adkins.<ref name="AutoRD-8"/> He was formally inducted by Adkins at the October 23, 2010, Opry performance. Shelton recorded the title track for the remake of ''[[Footloose (2011 film)|Footloose]]'' released on October 14, 2011.

The album debuted at No.&nbsp;1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] with around 116,000 copies sold.<ref name="AutoRD-12"/> "[[God Gave Me You]]", a cover of a [[Dave Barnes]] song, was the album's second single; it also reached No.&nbsp;1. "Drink on It", the fifth song on the album, hit No.&nbsp;1 in April 2012, giving him his 11th No.&nbsp;1 song.

== Record as coach on ''The Voice'' ==
Shelton has been a coach on [[NBC]]'s ''The Voice'' since its inception in 2011. Shelton had been the most successful coach, having brought at least one artist from his team (for a total of 31) to the finale in almost every season (except season five), eight of which went on to win the season.
