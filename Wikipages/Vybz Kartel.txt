==Arrest and imprisonment==
===Charges===
On 29 September 2011, Kartel was arrested by police for cannabis possession. Jamaica's Major Investigation Taskforce (MIT) later charged him with the [[murder]] of Jamaican businessman Barrington Burton, [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and illegal possession of a [[firearm]].<ref name="Meschino">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466879/vybz-kartel-jamaican-dancehall-star-charged-with-murder|title=Vybz Kartel, Jamaican Dancehall Star, Charged with Murder|last=Meschino|first=Patricia|work=Billboard|access-date=23 March 2012|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331022658/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/466879/vybz-kartel-jamaican-dancehall-star-charged-with-murder|archive-date=31 March 2013}}</ref>

On July 24, a jury found Kartel not guilty of the charge of murder of Barrington Burton.

===Conviction===

On April 3, 2014, Kartel was sentenced to life imprisonment. Justice Lennox Campbell said he would be eligible for parole after serving 35 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jamaica-gleaner.com/latest/article.php?id=52072|title=Vybz Kartel sentenced to life in prison, to serve 35 years before parole|publisher=Jamaica Gleaner|access-date=26 December 2014|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141226051519/http://jamaica-gleaner.com/latest/article.php?id=52072|archive-date=26 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/jamaica-vybz-kartel-gets-life-murder-181325802.html|agency=Associated Press|access-date=4 April 2014|title=In Jamaica, Vybz Kartel gets life for murder|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407105028/http://news.yahoo.com/jamaica-vybz-kartel-gets-life-murder-181325802.html|archive-date=7 April 2014}}</ref>

===Appeal===

Exactly six years later on April 3, 2020, a three-member panel of judges in the [[Judiciary_of_Jamaica#Court_of_Appeal|Jamaican Court of Appeal]] reaffirmed Kartel's conviction.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dancehallmag.com/2020/04/03/news/vybz-kartel-loses-appeal-case-but-sentence-might-be-reduced.html|publisher=DancehallMag|access-date=3 April 2020|title=Vybz Kartel Loses Appeal Case But Sentence Might Be Reduced|archive-date=8 April 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200408022539/https://www.dancehallmag.com/2020/04/03/news/vybz-kartel-loses-appeal-case-but-sentence-might-be-reduced.html|url-status=live}}</ref>  On April 17, 2020 the Court of Appeal reduced Kartel's parole eligibility to 32 years and 6 months, citing Justice Campbell's failure to consider time the singer had spent in jail while awaiting trial in 2014.

==Controversies==

===2004 UK MOBO===
Kartel's 2004 UK MOBO award nomination was withdrawn amidst controversy over homophobic content of his lyrics.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3636696.stm Mobo drops 'homophobic' artists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122165053/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3636696.stm |date=22 November 2008 }} BBC News, 8 September 2004</ref>

As described by Rolling Stone, Kartel is "credited with helping to erode Jamaica’s long-held taboo against oral sex by singing about blow jobs."<ref name=":0" />

===Skin whitening===
Kartel has come under controversy over perceived [[skin whitening]], or "bleaching", leading him to claim the use of "cake soap" to lighten his skin.<ref name=rub>Hunter, Nadisha.

===Airwave ban===
In September 2011, the National Communications Network of [[Guyana]] banned Vybz Kartel from the airwaves—the first such action against a specific artist.<ref>{{cite news| author =Associated Press| author-link =Associated Press| title =Guyana bans Kartel's obscene music| newspaper =[[Associated Press]] via [[The Jamaica Observer]]| date =21 September 2011| url =http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Guyana-bans-Kartel-s-obscene-music| access-date =28 April 2015| url-status =live| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20150620115811/http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Guyana-bans-Kartel-s-obscene-music| archive-date =20 June 2015| df =dmy-all}}</ref> NCN spokesman Martin Goolsarran said his music contained "obscene lyrics" and brought "nothing positive" to the entertainment industry, on Wednesday, 21 September after a week of internal debate. He said NCN was reviewing the lyrics of other musicians and could ban them as well.

===Feud with Mavado===
A public feud between Kartel and former collaborator [[Mavado (singer)|Mavado]] arose towards the end of 2006, stemming from Vybz' much publicised departure from the dancehall conglomerate group The Alliance. The feud resulted in numerous diss tracks released, in which each artist dissed the other and their associates over popular dancehall rhythms.<ref name=Voice>Dreisinger, Baz.

YardFlex.com Archives, 2 March 2007; accessed 27 January 2011</ref>

However, by the summer of 2008, tensions flared with a renewal of "diss tracks" from each artist, and a lyrical clash between the two at Sting 2008 left mixed views as to the "winner".<ref>[http://www.yardflex.com/archives/003051.html Mavado and Vybz Kartel at it again] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721130105/http://www.yardflex.com/archives/003051.html |date=21 July 2011 }}.
