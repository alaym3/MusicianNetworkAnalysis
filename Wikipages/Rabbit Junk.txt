'''Rabbit Junk''' is a [[Seattle]]-based [[industrial metal]] band that formed in 2004 by former [[the Shizit]] frontman JP Anderson and his wife Jennifer "Sum Grrl" Bernert.<ref name="MySpace">[http://www.myspace.com/rabbitjunkband Rabbit Junk Official MySpace] Retrieved on April 19, 2008</ref>

After achieving success with their second album ''Reframe'', Rabbit Junk went on hiatus after the release of their fourth album ''Project Nonagon'', but returned in 2014 after positive reception to several promotional singles. They have since released several EPs and two more studio albums, 2018's ''Rabbit Junk Will Die!: Meditations on Mortality'' and 2020's ''Xenospheres''.

==History==
=== Formation, self-titled album and ''REframe'' (2004–2006) ===
Rabbit Junk started in 2004 after the dissolution of JP Anderson's former band, [[the Shizit]]. After adding additional vocalist  Jennifer "Sum Grrl" Bernert to the band, the husband and wife electro-rock duo released their self-titled debut album titled ''[[Rabbit Junk (album)|Rabbit Junk]]'' in 2004.<ref>[http://www.glitchmode.com/rabbit-junk/ Glitch Mode Recordings - Rabbit Junk]</ref> One year later, the band signed to [[Glitch Mode Recordings]] and released the follow-up to their debut album called ''[[REframe]]'', which gained the band a stronger and more broad fan base.<ref>[http://www.regenmag.com/index.php?module=pagesetter&func=viewpub&tid=19&pid=24 Interview With ReGEn Artist Spotlight]</ref>

A video for the song "In Your Head No One Can Hear You Scream" was produced by the Kandycore Design Company. The project would later become a Live band, as JP added live [[guitarist]]s and [[percussion]] to live shows.

After ''REframe'' was released, Rabbit Junk contributed the song "Industrial Is Dead" to the Glitch Mode compilation CD ''Hordes of the Elite''. Later, a cover of Atari Teenage Riot's "Start The Riot" appeared on the [[D-Trash]] Records [[Atari Teenage Riot]] tribute album called "The Virus Has Been Spread".

=== ''This Life'' and ''Project Nonagon'' (2007–2010) ===
In October 2007, the first two Rabbit Junk albums were remastered by Tom Baker (who has worked with [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Nine Inch Nails]] and [[the Bloodhound Gang]]), when the band signed onto [[Full Effect]] Records. The band released a follow-up to REframe titled ''[[This Life Is Where You Get Fucked]]'' on April 28, 2008. The album is a concept album, which consists around three 'suites', having their own themes drawing from specific influences for each facet. "Ghetto Blasphemer", "This Death Is Where You Get Life" and "The Struggle" are the three separate pieces that formed  the album ''This Life is Where you get F*cked'' into an entire presentation.<ref name="MySpace"/>

In September 2008, Rabbit Junk released three new songs on their [[MySpace]] page for download, titled "Power", "Blood" and "Home".<ref name="MySpace"/>

The second part of Rabbit Junk's "Ghetto Blasphemer" suite, based on the works of [[HP Lovecraft]], were released in July 2009 on their website. The full ''[[Project Nonagon]]'' album was released in 2010. JP Anderson criticised his time on Full Effect Records, stating that although the label did nothing intentionally wrong, he felt "isolated" by the label's control over Rabbit Junk's image and interaction with fans.<ref name=Rocksins>[http://www.rocksins.com/2015/09/jp-anderson-rabbit-junk-projects-full-length-album-dead-25533/ JP Anderson on RABBIT JUNK and other projects: “The full-length album is dead”] RockSins, September 10, 2015. Retrieved September 19, 2015.</ref>

=== "The Lost Years" (2011–2013) ===
After the band's departure from Full Effect Records, Anderson focused his efforts on various side projects throughout 2009 including [[steampunk]]-inspired Fighting Ice With Iron, [[folk metal]] Wolves Under Sail, and a revival of his old band [[the Shizit]], later rebranded as the Named due to contract disputes with his former bandmembers. From 2011 to 2013, Rabbit Junk released a series of singles which Anderson claims were keeping the project "on life support" after the experiences with Full Effect. After the release of "Break Shins to This" in 2013, and the positive feedback that followed, Anderson decided to move Rabbit Junk's music into a more electronic direction. The band released "From the Ashes" (which contained a sampled riff from "[[Dead Embryonic Cells]]" by [[Sepultura]]) on a 2013 Christmas sampler by [[Glitch Mode Recordings]], who they would from then on work with on a regular basis, however the more theatrical metal direction was rejected for future releases. This era of the band would come to be known as "The Lost Years".

===''Pop That Pretty Thirty'' and EPs (2014–2016)===
Anderson released a new EP in 2014, titled "[[Pop That Pretty Thirty]]", shortly followed by their first live EP, "Live 2014". In January 2015 the band released the "[[Invasion (Rabbit Junk EP)|Invasion]]" EP, with Anderson has since stating in interviews that Rabbit Junk will no longer release full-length albums and will only release [[extended plays]], aiming for two per year, as it allows for more creative freedom and not being confined to fixed concepts.

Rabbit Junk released "[[Beast (Rabbit Junk EP)|Beast]]" on October 28, 2015. On February 9, 2016, the band released "[[Singles from the Lost Years 2011–2013]]", which contained remastered and alternate versions of all the singles that were released in between "[[Project Nonagon]]" and "[[Pop That Pretty Thirty]]".

===''Rabbit Junk Will Die: Meditations on Mortality'' and ''Xenospheres'' (2017–present)===
''Like the Flesh Does the Knife'', an EP of remixes from ''Beast'', ''Invasion'', and ''Pop That Pretty Thirty'', was released in 2017. Rabbit Junk officially announced the release of ''Rabbit Junk Will Die: Meditations on Mortality'', their first full-length album in eight years, in late 2017, and released it January 2018.

In July 2019, Rabbit Junk confirmed that they had re-obtained the rights to their pre-2011 recordings and would be re-releasing the original albums ''Rabbit Junk'', ''Reframe'', ''This Life Is Where You Get Fucked'', and ''Project Nonagon'' through Bandcamp with new original artwork by frequent collaborator Andrew Tremblay, and proceeded to release them over the next few months, alongside the ''Reveal'' EP. In December of that year, Anderson announced another album with a tentative release date for 2020, later titling it ''Xenospheres''. The first single "Bits & Razors" was released in April 2020 and was followed by "Prismatic" in July.
