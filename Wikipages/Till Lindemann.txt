Lindemann started to play drums for Schwerin-based experimental rock band [[First Arsch]] in 1986,<ref name=bettendorfp117>Bettendorf, p. 117.</ref> who released an album titled ''Saddle Up'' in 1992, and played one song ("Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend") with a punk band called [[Feeling B]], which was the former band of Rammstein members [[Paul Landers]], [[Christoph Schneider]] and [[Christian Lorenz|Christian "Flake" Lorenz]] in 1989.<ref name=bettendorfp117/> During his time in Feeling B, he played the drums in the band.<ref name=bettendorfp117/> In the 1990s, Lindemann began to write lyrics. In 1994, the band entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track demo professionally. When questioned as to why Rammstein was named after the [[Ramstein air show disaster]],<ref>Ronald Galenza, Heinz Havemeister: Feeling B. Mix mir einen Drink. – p. 262.

Lindemann then moved to Berlin. During Rammstein's early years, because of his use of over-the-top pyrotechnics, Lindemann has burned his ears, hair and arms.<ref name=blender2007>{{cite news |first= David |last=Peisner |title= Rock Stars Who've Caught Fire Onstage! |date=February 2007 |publisher= Blender Magazine Online |url= http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2534&src=blender_ed |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218214031/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2534&src=blender_ed |archive-date=18 December 2008 |access-date= 15 November 2014 }}</ref> Bandmate Christoph Schneider commented, "Till gets burned all the time, but he likes the pain."<ref name=blender2007/> An incident in September 1996 caused a section of the band's set to burn, and as a result, Lindemann got his certification in pyrotechnics so the band could perform with pyrotechnics more safely than it had previously.<ref name=Grundke>{{cite news |last1=Grundke |first1=Vincent |title=Rammstein-Poet Till Lindemann wird heute 51 |url=http://www.ampya.com/news/Aktuell/Rammstein-Poet-Till-Lindemann-wird-heute-51-SN105026/ |access-date=30 October 2014 |work=Ampya |language=de |date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140219201004/http://www.ampya.com/news/Aktuell/Rammstein-Poet-Till-Lindemann-wird-heute-51-SN105026/ |archive-date=19 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=France |first1=Pauline |title=Top 10 Creepiest Moments on Stage |url=http://www2.fender.com/experience/fender-picks/top-10-creepiest-moments-on-stage/ |publisher=[[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]] |access-date=21 September 2016 |date=27 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808082905/http://www2.fender.com/experience/fender-picks/top-10-creepiest-moments-on-stage/ |archive-date=8 August 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
[[file:TillLindemann2011.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Lindemann performing with Rammstein]]
During Rammstein's US tour with [[Korn]] in 1998, Lindemann and his bandmate [[Christian "Flake" Lorenz]] were arrested in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] for lewd conduct performed during their song "[[Bück dich]]" ("bend over"), which consisted of Lindemann using a liquid squirting [[dildo]] and simulating anal sex on Lorenz.<ref name=worcestor1999/> Both Lindemann and Lorenz were released the following day after bail was met.<ref name=worcestor1999>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433611/rammsteins-act-lands-two-members-jail.jhtml |title=Rammstein's Act Lands Two Members in Jail |publisher=MTV |date=7 June 1999 |access-date=22 June 2014}}</ref> This incident did not stop Lindemann from performing in the same manner for future shows outside the United States, particularly in Australia when they performed at the 2011 [[Big Day Out]],<ref>{{cite news |last1=Northover |first1=Kylie |title=Rammstein get out their phallic cymbals |url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/rammstein-get-out-their-phallic-cymbals-20110113-19oym.html |access-date=16 November 2014 |work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=14 January 2011}}</ref> but the United States performances of this song were changed into a sadomasochistic theme that did not feature dildos, although this was not the case for all remaining US shows on the tour. For example, on 18 June 1999, "Bück dich" was performed in the same  manner at the [[Roseland Theater]] in [[Portland, Oregon]]. In 1999, the band was blamed for the 1999 Columbine massacre, but they denied their music was a factor.<ref name="NYTimesPowersPage1">{{cite news |last=Powers |first=Ann |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/04/25/weekinreview/the-nation-the-stresses-of-youth-the-strains-of-its-music.html |title=The Nation; The Stresses of Youth, The Strains of Its Music |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 April 2000 |access-date=15 November 2010}}</ref><ref name="1999 Aprillind">{{cite news |author1=MTV News Staff |title=KMFDM And Rammstein Speak Out About Columbine |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1427256/kmfdm-and-rammstein-speak-out-about-columbine/ |access-date=15 November 2014 |work=MTV |date=23 April 1999}}</ref> In November 2002, Lindemann's poetry book ''Messer'' was published.

Lindemann is not a stranger to injury, as he mentioned in Rammstein's early career that he'd gotten burned several times with unprofessionally rigged [[pyrotechnics]].<ref name=blender2007/> At a performance in Sweden in 2005, he received a knee injury on stage when keyboardist Flake accidentally ran into him while riding a [[Segway PT]].<ref name=segwayinc>{{cite web |title=Rammstein Cancels Shows in Asia |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=14758 |publisher=Metal Underground |access-date=16 November 2014 |date=1 August 2005}}</ref> This injury caused several tour dates in Asia to be cancelled.<ref name=segwayinc/>

In 2005, five Rammstein albums received platinum awards and the band also received the "World Sales Awards" for over 10 million sold copies worldwide.<ref>{{cite web |title=History (December 16, 2005) |url=http://www.rammstein.de/en/rammstein |publisher=Rammstein |access-date=15 November 2014}}</ref>

During the filming of the band's music video for "[[Ich tu dir weh]]", Lindemann wanted a light put in his mouth to create a visually stunning effect.<ref name=ichtu/> Bandmate Paul Landers suggested that he use a flesh colored wire and run it along his cheek to shine a light into his mouth from the outside.<ref name=ichtu/> Lindemann refused, and instead opted to have a surgical incision in his left cheek, so that a light could be fed into his mouth directly, and largely out of sight.<ref name=ichtu>{{cite web |author1=Sonisphere |title=RAMMSTEIN – Making of Ich Tu Dir Weh |url=http://www.muzu.tv/sonisphere/rammstein-making-of-ich-tu-dir-weh-video/606149/ |publisher=Muzu.tv |access-date=29 October 2014 |archive-date=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029074611/http://www.muzu.tv/sonisphere/rammstein-making-of-ich-tu-dir-weh-video/606149/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=gauntlet>{{cite news |title=Rammstein frontman pierced his cheek for new video |url=http://www.thegauntlet.com/article/307/17547/rammstein-frontman-pierced-his-cheek-for-new-video.html |access-date=1 November 2014 |work=The Gauntlet |date=21 December 2009}}</ref>

There is a specific performance move of Lindemann's, dubbed "The Till Hammer". This move is where he bends his knees, beats his thigh with a fist in a hammering motion while turning his head from side to side. On occasion, Flake has been seen to parody the move onstage. Unlike most frontmen, Lindemann stated in an interview that he does not like being looked at while on stage, and would wear sunglasses to block out views of the audience.<ref name=rollingstone>{{cite web |last1=Schmidt |first1=Rainer |title=Rammstein: Exclusive Interview with Till Lindemann and Flake Lorenz |url=http://www.rollingstone.de/magazin/features/article126618/rammstein-exklusives-interview-mit-till-lindemann-und-flake-lorenz.html |publisher=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=16 November 2014 |date=12 December 2011}}</ref>

The main purpose of the band's signature pyrotechnics has also been stated to actually be a tool in taking the audience's attention away from Lindemann, whilst doubling as a spectacle for the audience. Lindemann often opts to just look directly at the mixing booth in the center of the crowd, except when directly interacting with an audience member. In 2011, [[Roadrunner Records]] listed Lindemann at number 50 of the 50 greatest metal frontmen of all time.<ref name="rosen 2011">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jeremy |title=The 50 Greatest Metal Frontmen of all Time |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/the-50-greatest-metal-front-men-of-all-time |publisher=Roadrunner Records |access-date=29 October 2014|date=2011}}</ref> In 2013, Lindemann's second poetry book, ''In stillen Nächten'' was published.<ref name=tages2013>{{cite news |last1=Schoepfer |first1=L. |title=The Misunderstood |url=http://www.tagesanzeiger.ch/kultur/buecher/Der-Unverstandene/story/19402934 |access-date=16 November 2014 |work=Tages-Anzeiger |date=3 October 2013 |language=de}}</ref> He commented on the poetry, saying "The vast majority of my poems could have been written a few hundred years earlier."<ref name=tages2013/>

===Poetry===

In 2018, Lindemann embarked on a book signing tour across Russia for his poetry book, ''Messer'', originally released in German and then translated into Russian and re-released to the Russian market. Lindemann showed up to his book signing in [[Moscow]] with an unknown person in a [[Bondage suit|gimp costume]]. The female gimp was led through the crowd by Lindemann before he sat down to sign autographs and talk to fans.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.rawmusictv.com/news/2018/Till-Lindemann-Rammstein-turned-up-to-his-book-signing-in-Moscow-with-a-gimp | title = Till Lindemann turned up to a book signing with a gimp | date = 5 December 2018 | access-date = 5 December 2018 }}</ref> It is still unknown who was in the outfit, but suggestions are that of his girlfriend at the time.

Lindemann himself describes his lyrics as "love songs".<ref>Bettendorf, p. 99.</ref> Some songs written by him have references to 19th century or earlier literature.

Lindemann has used [[contemporary literature]] for [[Intertextuality|intertextual references]]; the song title "[[Non, je ne regrette rien]]" was used as a chorus for the song "Frühling in Paris", and the song lyrics of "[[Links 2-3-4]]" are based from the song "Einheitsfrontlied" by [[Bertolt Brecht]].<ref>Littlejohn, p. 126.</ref> According to Lindemann, the lyrics of the song state the band's political category, positioning themselves on [[Left-wing politics|the left]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.laut.de/vorlaut/news/2000/12/14/01319/index.htm |title=Rammstein: Das Herz schlägt links, oder? |publisher=Laut.de  |access-date=20 November 2014}} This song is in fact written by [[Bertolt Brecht]] and composed by [[Hanns Eisler]] in 1934.

The song "Cowboy" is a criticism of the hypermasculine character of Americans. Despite "Hollywood propaganda", Lindemann states that it was actually the cowboys who beat up the Native Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Till Lindemann Talks Skills In Pills.

==Personal life==

Lindemann's daughter Nele was born in 1985, and he spent the first seven years of her life as a single father.<ref name=bettendorfp117/> He has one grandson through Nele.<ref name=RIANov>{{cite news|title=Rammstein vocalist Till Lindemann admitted that he hates the noise|url=http://ria.ru/culture/20120706/693155177.html|access-date=10 November 2014|work=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=6 July 2012}}</ref> On 28 February 1991, his ex-wife and his Rammstein bandmate [[Richard Kruspe]] had a daughter together named Khira, who shares her surname with Lindemann rather than Kruspe as her mother retained the surname when they divorced and never married Kruspe. Lindemann's second daughter, Marie Louise, was born in 1993 to ex-wife Anja Köseling.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0511570/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm#trivia |title=Till Lindemann – Biography |work=IMDb |year=2014 |access-date=22 June 2014}}</ref> He dated actress and model [[Sophia Thomalla]] from April 2011 to November 2015.
