Confetti are manufactured in multiple colors, and commercially available confetti come in many different shapes. A distinction is made between confetti and [[glitter]]; glitter is smaller than confetti (pieces usually no larger than 1mm) and is universally shiny. Most table confetti are also shiny. While they are called metallic confetti they are actually metallized PVC. The most popular shape is the star{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}. Seasonally, Snowflake Confetti are the most requested shape.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} Most [[party]] supply stores carry paper and metallic confetti. Confetti are commonly used at social gatherings such as parties, weddings, and [[Bar Mitzvah]]s. The simplest confetti are simply shredded paper (see [[ticker-tape parade]]), and can be made with scissors or a [[paper shredder]]. Other confetti often consist of [[Chad (paper)|chad]]s punched out of scrap paper. A [[hole punch]] can be used to make small round chads. For more elaborate chads, a [[ticket punch]] can be used. Most pieces of paper flats will flutter as [[tumblewing]]s giving flight times because of gliding aerodynamics.

In recent years the use of confetti as a cosmetic addition to trophy presentations at sporting events has become increasingly common. In this case, larger strips of paper (typically measuring 20&nbsp;mm × 60&nbsp;mm) in the colors appropriate to the team or celebration are used. For smaller volumes of confetti, [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] or [[PVC]] "barrels" are filled and the confetti is projected via a "cannon" (a small [[pressure vessel]]) using compressed air or [[carbon dioxide]]. For larger venues or volumes of confetti, a [[Venturi effect|venturi]] air mover powered by [[carbon dioxide]] is used to propel significantly larger volumes of confetti greater distances.

==History==
Since the Middle Ages, in Northern Italy it was common usage for the participants of carnival parades to throw objects at the crowd, mostly mud balls, eggs, coins or fruit. These traditions are still present in some towns in different forms, such as the "Battle of the Oranges" in [[Ivrea]].

The use of throwing objects at parades is well documented in Milan since the 14th century. The nobles used to throw candies and flowers during the parades while dames threw eggshells filled with essences and perfumes. Lower-class people mocked the nobles by throwing rotten eggs, and battles among enemy factions or districts became common. In 1597, the city governor [[Juan Fernández de Velasco]] imposed a ban on the eggs throwing, along with banning ''squittaroli'' (spraying liquids in the street)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QQ1wBAAAQBAJ&q=Juan+Fern%C3%A1ndez+de+Velasco+confetti+ban&pg=PT85 |title=Wedding Bells and Chimney Sweeps « Bruce Montague |isbn=9781784180423 |access-date=2016-11-03|last1=Montague |first1=Bruce |date=July 2014 }}</ref> and other immoral behaviors. The custom disappeared for about a century, coming back in the 1700s in the form of launch of small candies, mostly sugar-coated seeds. The seeds used for the sugar candies were mostly Coriander (''coriandolo'' in Italian), a common plantation in the area: the Italian name for confetti is indeed ''coriandoli''.<ref name="corriere2004">[http://milano.corriere.it/vivimilano/arte_e_cultura/articoli/2004/02_Febbraio/25/coriandoli.shtml] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100703021847/http://milano.corriere.it/vivimilano/arte_e_cultura/articoli/2004/02_Febbraio/25/coriandoli.shtml|date=July 3, 2010}}</ref>

The candies were expensive, though, and the lower classes often used small [[chalk]] balls instead, called ''benis de gess'' (chalk candy). Those were officially defined as "the only material allowed to be thrown during the parades" in an edict by the Prefect of Milan in 1808, but the battles fought with them in the 1800s became too large and dangerous, with hundreds of people involved, leading to a ban of the chalk pellets. People circumvented the ban by using mud balls.<ref name="corriere2004"/>

In 1875, an Italian businessman from [[Milan]], Enrico Mangili, began selling paper confetti for use in the upcoming ''carnevale di Milano'', the yearly parade held along the streets of the city.<ref name="Lagobba.it">{{cite web|url=http://www.lagobba.it/?p=482 |title=Enrico Mangili, l'inventore dei coriandoli « Cascina Gobba |publisher=Lagobba.it |date=2010-11-21 |access-date=2014-07-21}}</ref>

At that time, the province of Milan was one of the main hubs of silk manufacturing. Mangili begun collecting the small punched paper disks that were left as a byproduct from the production of the holed sheets used by the [[silkworm]] breeders as cage bedding, and selling them for profit. The new paper confetti was well received by the customers, being less harmful, funnier and cheaper than the alternatives, and their use quickly replaced previous customs in Milan and northern Italy.<ref name="Lagobba.it"/>

''[[Scientific American]]'' recorded that the throwing of paper confetti (plain shredded paper) occurred at the 1885 New Year's Eve in Paris.<ref>http://how-to-x.info/180675-what-is-the-origin-of-confetti.htm{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Paper confetti became common in all of Europe in just a couple of decades later (unlike [[ticker tape parade]]s, which never received as wide a diffusion as they did in the U.S.).

Game shows still used the classic balloon tradition for big wins until the late 1990s.

Some weddings use natural petal confetti.  These are made from freeze-dried flower petals and are completely [[Biodegradation|biodegradeable]].  In fact, venues may now only allow these biodegradable versions to be used.  Some wedding venues have decided that due to the mess and potential inconvenience caused by the use of confetti to ban its usage completely.  One way that this restriction has been circumvented is to use soap bubbles in place of confetti.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Wedding Confetti, where did it come from, and where is it going?

== Etymology and Italian ''confetti'' ==
[[File:Amande-avolas-blanche.png|thumb|Italian confetti]]
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[wikt:confetti|confetti]]'' (to denote [[Jordan almonds]]) is adopted from the [[Italy|Italian]] [[confectionery]] of the same name, which was a small sweet traditionally thrown during [[carnivals]].<ref name="Etymology and Origin">{{cite web|url=http://celebrationsandme.posterous.com/etymology |title=Etymology and Origin |publisher=Celebrationsandme.posterous.com |access-date=2014-07-21}}</ref> Also known as ''[[dragée]]'' or [[comfit]], Italian confetti are [[almond]]s with a hard [[sugar]] coating; their name equates to French ''[[confit]]''. The Italian word for paper confetti is ''[[wikt:coriandolo|coriandoli]]'' which refers to the [[coriander]] seeds originally contained within the sweet.<ref name="Italian Confetti">{{cite web |author=admin on June 29, 2011 |url=http://www.foodinitaly.org/a-brief-history-of-confetti/ |title=A Brief History of Confett |publisher=Foodinitaly.org |date=2011-06-29 |access-date=2014-07-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130414183247/http://www.foodinitaly.org/a-brief-history-of-confetti/ |archive-date=April 14, 2013 }}</ref>

By tradition, the Italian ''confetti'' (sugar coated almonds) are given out are thrown at weddings (white coating) and baptisms (blue or pink coating, according to the sex of the newborn baby), or graduations (red coating), often wrapped in a small [[tulle netting|tulle]] bag as a gift to the guests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pianetadonna.it/coppia/matrimonio/colore-confetti-significato.html|title=Confetti: qual è il colore giusto per ogni festa e anniversario?

The [[United Kingdom|British]] adapted the missiles to [[weddings]] (displacing the traditional grains or rice symbolising sexual fertility) at the end of the 19th century, using symbolic shreds of coloured paper rather than real sweets.<ref name="Etymology and Origin"/>
