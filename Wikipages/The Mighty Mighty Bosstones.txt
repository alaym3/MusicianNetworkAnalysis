'''The Mighty Mighty Bosstones''' (informally referred to as '''The Bosstones''') is an American [[ska punk]] band from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], formed in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/artistindex/9803.bosstones.html |title=Guitar World &#124; Mighty Mighty Bosstones |date=2002-12-20 |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021220171748/http://www.guitarworld.com/artistindex/9803.bosstones.html |archive-date=2002-12-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aceticket.com/mighty-mighty-bosstones-tickets/ |title=Mighty Mighty Bosstones Tickets, 2011 Mighty Mighty Bosstones Schedule |publisher=AceTicket.com |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zvents.com/z/mansfield-ma/the-mighty-mighty-bosstones--performers--17165 |title=The Mighty Mighty Bosstones&nbsp;– Upcoming Shows & Performances |publisher=Zvents |date=2008-11-12 |access-date=2011-10-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001133146/http://www.zvents.com/z/mansfield-ma/the-mighty-mighty-bosstones--performers--17165 |archive-date=2011-10-01 }}</ref> Since the band's inception, lead vocalist [[Dicky Barrett]], bassist [[Joe Gittleman]], tenor saxophonist [[Tim Burton (musician)|Tim "Johnny Vegas" Burton]] and dancer ("Bosstone") Ben Carr have remained constant members. The line-up also includes drummer [[Joe Sirois]], saxophonist Leon Silva, guitarist Lawrence Katz, keyboardist [[John Goetchius]], and trombonist [[Chris Rhodes]].

The Bosstones are often credited as one of the progenitors of the genre of [[ska punk]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Lavin|first=Lauren|date=2020-07-14|title=The Bizarre History Of Ska Music|url=https://www.grunge.com/226505/the-bizarre-history-of-ska-music/|access-date=2021-05-07|website=Grunge.com|language=en-US}}</ref> and the creators of its subgenre ska-core, which mixes elements of [[ska]] with [[hardcore punk]]. Starting with the release of their 1989 debut ''[[Devil's Night Out]]'', the band toured and recorded extensively throughout the 1990s, becoming influential in the development of the American [[third-wave ska]] scene and was one of the first bands to popularize the genre in the musical mainstream. They reached their commercial peak with their [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]]-selling 1997 album ''[[Let's Face It]]'' and its hit single "[[The Impression That I Get]]". The band had released seven studio albums, three EPs and a live album by the time they announced a [[wikt:hiatus|hiatus]] in December 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Punknews.org|title=Bosstones on ''hiatus'' / side projects update|url=https://www.punknews.org/article/7804/bosstones-on-hiatus-side-projects-update|access-date=2021-05-07|website=www.punknews.org|language=en}}</ref> In 2007, the Bosstones reunited to resume recording and touring, and have since released four more studio albums.

From 1994 to 2002, and since 2007, they have hosted the annual [[Hometown Throwdown]] music festival, held annually around Christmas time in [[Downtown Boston]].

==History==

===Early history (1983–1988)===
The band's roots lie in the hardcore punk scene of the early 1980s, along with a strong influence from the British [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] [[ska]] scene of the 1970s.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography">{{cite book

The Cheapskates lineup went through frequent changes and would feature members of Gang Green on occasion. It was through Cheapskates that a core lineup coalesced around Barrett, Gittleman, [[Tim "Johnny Vegas" Burton]] (saxophone), [[Nate Albert]] (guitar), Josh Dalsimer (drums), Tim Bridwell (trumpet) and Ben Carr (a ubiquitous, dancing non-musician onstage presence, later credited as "Bosstone").<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The group decided on the name, "the Bosstones" as a reference to the city near their hometowns. While some of the band members were influenced by bands such as [[AC/DC]], [[Social Distortion]], [[Motörhead]], [[The Clash]] and [[Stiff Little Fingers]], Barrett had become enthralled with [[2 Tone (music genre)|2 Tone]] ska, which was in the tail end of its prominence.

In 1987, the Bosstones made their recorded debut when they were featured on the ''Mash It Up'' ska compilation. The Bosstones' contribution was "The Cave", and "Ugly". Another early recording, "Drums and Chickens," appeared on the 1989 ska compilation ''Mashin' Up The Nation''. By the time ''Mashin' Up The Nation'' was released, the Bosstones had temporarily disbanded in order for Albert and Gittleman to finish high school. After their graduation, the band reunited. Around this time, it was brought to the band's attention that an [[a cappella]] group, [[The Bosstones]], had already used the name during the 1950s. A bartender friend arbitrarily suggested that they become the "Mighty Mighty Bosstones", in order to avoid any possible legal hassles, to which the band agreed.

===Taang! years (1989–1992)===
Despite not consistently drawing large crowds at their live shows, the [[Taang! Records|Taang!]] record label gave the band a [[recording contract]] which would result in the ''[[Devil's Night Out]]'' album, produced by [[Paul Q. Kolderie]].<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album was released to positive local and lukewarm national reaction during a time when ska was struggling to move out of the American underground. The band found resistance from ska purists who did not like that the band were not playing traditional ska while hardcore fans were against the ska and heavy metal elements in the music. Despite the initial reaction, ''Devil's Night Out'' has gone on to become one of the band's most popular albums.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Bosstones.jpg|thumb|left|The Bosstones in 2008, wearing their trademark plaid clothes. Front: Dicky Barrett, Back, from left: Chris Rhodes, Lawrence Katz]]
It was during this time that the band's trademark [[Plaid (pattern)|plaid]] clothing came to be. After a show where Barrett wore plaid, fans started to show up wearing it as well. It was noticeable enough that the band was approached by the [[Converse (company)|Converse]] sneaker company to promote their new line of [[Chuck Taylor All-Stars|Chuck Taylor]] sneakers. The band accepted the proposal and were seen in several television commercials promoting the sneakers.

By this time, Tim Bridewell had left the band, to be replaced by [[Dennis Brockenborough]] (trombone) and Kevin Lenear (saxophone). The band's next release was an EP titled ''[[Where'd You Go? (EP)|Where'd You Go?]]''. The EP featured the title track as well as cover versions of [[Aerosmith]]'s "[[Sweet Emotion]]", [[Metallica]]'s "[[Enter Sandman]]", [[Van Halen]]'s "[[Ain't Talkin' 'bout Love]]" and a new version of "Do Somethin' Crazy", originally featured on ''[[Devil's Night Out]].''<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/>

In 1991, the band set out on their first full American tour. It was during the first leg of touring that drummer Josh Dalsimer would leave the band to pursue a college education. He would be replaced by [[Joe Sirois]], who Barrett met at [[Bunker Hill Community College]]. Sirois would immediately join his new bandmates in the [[recording studio]] to start work on the band's second album.

Once again produced by [[Paul Q. Kolderie]], ''[[More Noise and Other Disturbances]]'' was released in June 1992.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The band would film a [[music video|video]] for the song "Where'd You Go?" which had previously been available on the EP of the same name (though the band had also recorded a video for "Guns and the Young", the video was not finished until a few years after it was recorded.

During this era, the band published a newsletter for their fans titled ''737''.

===Mainstream success and Big Rig Records (1993–2001)===
The band signed to their first major label when they joined the [[Mercury Records]] roster and soon recorded the ''[[Ska-Core, the Devil, and More]]'' EP. Released in March 1993, it was largely a collection of [[cover song]]s.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> Four of the seven tracks paid homage to the band's influences: [[The Angry Samoans]]' "Lights Out", [[Minor Threat]]'s "Think Again", [[SSD (band)|SSD]]'s "Police Beat" and [[The Wailers (1963–1974 band)|The Wailers]]' "[[Simmer Down]]". Three live tracks were included as well. The EP contained one new studio track "Someday I Suppose," which would later appear on the band's third full-length album.

Produced by Tony Platt, the band's third LP, ''[[Don't Know How to Party]]'' contained a cover of [[Stiff Little Fingers]]' song "Tin Soldiers" as well as a vocal appearance by Daryl Jennifer of [[Bad Brains]]. A video was also filmed for "Someday I Suppose" and it received minor airplay on [[MTV]]. Though the footage was originally intended to serve as a promo for the Bosstones debut on Mercury, the label liked the footage and turned it into a single. The band would also appear on the 1994 ''Kiss My Ass'' tribute to [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] album, covering "[[Detroit Rock City]]". Mercury Records released it as a single, appearing on 7-inch green vinyl and backed by the original Kiss version of the song. Soon after, the band found themselves invited by fellow Bostonian [[Steven Tyler]], to open up for [[Aerosmith]] at their [[New Year's Eve]] concert in Boston. While it was not the most successful show the Bosstones had played, it ensured that the Bosstones started 1994 on the road as they had intended.

The band released their fourth album, ''[[Question the Answers]],'' in October 1994.<ref name="The Great Rock Discography"/> The album featured production work by the Butcher Brothers, [[Paul Q. Kolderie]] and Ross Humphrey. It was at this time that the band decided it wanted to release their albums on vinyl, leading to a partnership with Mercury Records to form Big Rig Records, a [[vanity label]] that allowed the band to release their albums on vinyl. The Big Rig vinyl versions often contained a bonus track not seen on the cassette or CD versions. Besides touring, the band found itself making their network television debut on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'' and hosting MTV's ''[[120 Minutes]]''. They also contributed a new version of "Where'd You Go?" to the [[Alicia Silverstone]] movie ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]''. The band also made an appearance in the film, performing the songs "Where'd You Go?" and "Someday I Suppose" during a college fraternity party scene. On top of their TV and film appearances, the band was added to the main stage of the 1995 [[Lollapalooza]] tour. Mercury set about repromoting ''Question the Answers'' by adding a second disc with five [[B-side]] tracks. The EP was titled ''Here We Go Again'' and it was compiled by Barrett at the request of Mercury.

After touring as part of the 1996 [[Warped Tour]] lineup (which they would repeat the following year), the Bosstones began work on their next studio album. Released in 1997, ''[[Let's Face It]]'', would prove to be the band's biggest seller, mostly due to its first single "[[The Impression That I Get]]", which reached number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart. The album was followed by ''Video Stew'', a [[VHS]] compilation of the band's twelve music videos. The mainstream exposure led to the band's appearance on ''[[Sesame Street]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s ''[[Elmopalooza]]'' television special and Grammy Award-winning [[Elmopalooza! (soundtrack)|soundtrack album]], in which they performed the song "The Zig Zag Dance" with [[Count von Count|The Count]]. The band also made their ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' debut, performing "The Impression That I Get".

Capitalizing on the band's popularity, Mercury released the band's live album, ''[[Live From the Middle East]]'' in October 1998. The album was recorded live in Cambridge, Massachusetts at [[The Middle East (nightclub)|The Middle East]] Restaurant and Nightclub during the band's annual end-of-the-year Hometown Throwdown from 1997. In 1999, the band contributed their cover version of the song, "Rudie Can't Fail," to the ''Burning London'' [[The Clash|Clash]] tribute compilation. Shortly after all of these releases, Kevin Lenear quit the band to work on his own material and was replaced by Roman Fleysher. Founding member Nate Albert also left in order to obtain a degree in [[Political philosophy|political theory]] from [[Brown University]]. His next musical venture would be as a member of [[Evan Dando]]’s re-formed [[The Lemonheads|Lemonheads]] before forming [[The Kickovers]], which focused more on a 1970's punk sound than ska. Albert eventually became involved in band management, handling bands such as [[Bayside (band)|Bayside]] and [[Lost City Angels]]. Albert's replacement on guitar was Lawrence Katz.

In 2000, the band released ''[[Pay Attention]]'' which failed to meet expectations set by the previous album. "So Sad to Say", was released as a single, but it never reached a position higher than No.&nbsp;22 on the ''Billboard'' charts. Ultimately, the album did not sell as well as their previous release. This was to be the band's last album with Mercury Records, who along with [[PolyGram]], had become part of the [[Universal Music Group]] who subsequently merged [[Island Records]] and [[Def Jam Recordings]] forming the new [[Island Def Jam]] label. The band, unhappy with the way the newly formed label had been handling them, asked for a release from their contract, to which the label agreed. "Pay Attention" was also the last album for Dennis Brockenborough who had already formed his own band, Chubby, for which he sang and played guitar. Brockenborough's replacement was former [[Spring Heeled Jack (band)|Spring Heeled Jack]] member Chris Rhodes. Spring Heeled Jack had dissolved in 2000, and Rhodes had recently taken a vacant trombone position with [[Bim Skala Bim]] when he received the invitation to join.

===SideOneDummy and hiatus announcement (2002–2003)===
The band soon announced their return to an independent label when they signed with [[SideOneDummy Records]]. In July 2002, the band released ''[[A Jackknife to a Swan]]'' and from it the song "You Gotta Go!" was released as a single and video. The band continued to tour but in December 2003, they announced their decision to go on a hiatus and were forced to forgo that year's Hometown Throwdown. One contributing factor was that several band members were reported to already be busy with other bands and side projects. Another factor was that the band had been touring, almost non-stop, since 1991, and some of the band members desired a break.

On September 12, 2004, the band performed along with other punk rock groups in a tribute concert for [[Johnny Ramone]], in which the proceeds were given to support cancer research. Barrett remarked, "When the Ramones say hop, this cretin starts hopping." The concert was later made into the 2006 documentary film ''Too Tough to Die: A Tribute to Johnny Ramone''.<ref>Too Tough to Die: A Tribute to Johnny Ramone''</ref>

===Activities during hiatus (2004–2006)===
After the hiatus announcement, several members went on to work on other projects and bands. Barrett became the announcer on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' late night talk show. In 2005, he became the host of the ''Mighty Morning Show'' on Los Angeles radio's [[Indie 103.1]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]]. In March 2006, he was dismissed from the radio station.<ref>Reed, Mack. [http://www.lavoice.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1674 "Dicky Barrett Speaks: 'I Was Fired that Day'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928161126/http://www.lavoice.org/index.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1674 |date=September 28, 2007 }}, LAVoice.org, 24 March 2006.</ref>

Before the hiatus announcement, Gittleman had already formed a side project band named [[Avoid One Thing]] featuring members of [[Darkbuster]], the Raging Teens and Spring Heeled Jack. The band released two albums for SideOneDummy before announcing their own hiatus in 2005.

Sirois recorded and toured with Nate Albert's next band, Kickovers, and also played drums for the [[Street Dogs]] and [[Frank Black]].

Rhodes went on to play with [[The Toasters]] until his departure in 2006. Rhodes had just joined [[Bim Skala Bim]] before the Bosstones' hiatus came to an end and left Bim Skala Bim as a result. He also performed with former Spring Heeled Jack bandmate Rick Omonte in The Mountain Movers and as a fill-in trombonist for [[Less Than Jake]], [[Reel Big Fish]], and [[NOFX]].

Fleysher continued his pursuit of a professional pilot's license. In 2005, after taking classes near his home in South Florida and working as a flight instructor in his spare time, he was hired as an airline pilot for [[CommutAir]], a Continental Airlines regional affiliate based in [[Plattsburgh, New York]]. After a short stint with the company, he began flying as a charter pilot in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

Burton and his family moved to Los Angeles where he became active in the movie business. Besides working for a Hollywood agent, he wrote several scripts and developed projects for television. He also contributed saxophone for a [[Cypress Hill]] song. In 2007, he appeared in the film ''[[Crazy (2007 film)|Crazy]]'', which was inspired by the life of [[Hank Garland]].

Katz formed a band named Resistant. Katz has also played guitar on several motion picture soundtracks including ''[[Aquamarine (film)|Aquamarine]]'', ''[[The Good Night]]'' and ''[[London (2006 film)|London]]'', the latter recorded in collaboration with [[The Crystal Method]].

===Reunion and the future (2007–present)===
[[File:Mighty Mighty Bosstones fenway01 (6131838436).jpg|left|300px|thumb|The Bosstones playing [[Fenway Park]] in 2011.  L-R: Tim "Johnny Vegas" Burton, Kevin Lenear, Dicky Barrett, Ben "The Bosstone" Carr]]
Because the band left the possibility of playing together again open, rumors and speculation frequently circulated that a reunion was inevitable. The hiatus of Joe Gittleman's band, Avoid One Thing, fueled further speculation of such a reunion.

During an ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'' Acoustic Session, members of fellow Boston area [[ska]] band [[Big D and the Kids Table]] hinted that the Bosstones were in fact reuniting for another Hometown Throwdown. Jerry Mattes, the creator of the band's bulldog mascot, also acknowledged the chances of a reunion and announced that he was designing a new logo for the band.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://altpress.com/modules/dsp_mediaplayer.cfm?pathXML=xml_mp3.xml&track=15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114085424/http://altpress.com/modules/dsp_mediaplayer.cfm?pathXML=xml_mp3.xml&track=15|url-status=dead|title=Alternative Press MEDIA|archive-date=January 14, 2010}}</ref>

On October 11, 2007, on Boston Radio Station [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]], [[Dicky Barrett]] confirmed what he called "the worst kept secret in Boston": the announcement that the Bosstones would indeed play a tenth official Hometown Throwdown at Cambridge's famed [[The Middle East (nightclub)|Middle East]] club on December 26–30, 2007. Barrett would not confirm any long-term plans for the band. Soon after Barrett's announcement, Gittleman declared that the band intended to record three new songs to be included on an upcoming collection of unreleased material and vinyl [[A-side and B-side|B-sides]]. The album, titled ''[[Medium Rare (The Mighty Mighty Bosstones album)|Medium Rare]]'', was released on December 18, 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/26209#917246 |title=Mighty Mighty Bosstones to record new music for upcoming collection |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref> The three new songs marked the first new material recorded since the 2002 release of ''[[A Jackknife to a Swan]]''.

After the 2007 Throwdown, the Bosstones played a few shows every couple of months. At two of the March shows in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] and Los Angeles, [[Jimmy Kimmel]] served as a guest star on [[bass clarinet]] during "The Impression That I Get". Former saxophonist Lenear rejoined the band, replacing Fleysher, whose job prevented him from being able to play with the band.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Despite the activity, the Bosstones remained non-committal on whether they would record and release a studio album. They did make it known that they would no longer tour at the frequency they were known for in the past.

On May 15, 2008, it was reported that the Bosstones would be embarking on a short United States tour in July with the [[Dropkick Murphys]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/28896 |title=Dropkick Murphys / The Mighty Mighty Bosstones |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref> During the tour, the Bosstones made three stops at [[Boston Red Sox]] minor league ballparks. On October 20, 2008, their website announced that they would return to the Middle East in Cambridge to play an eleventh Hometown Throwdown on December 26–29. In late 2008, the game ''[[Rock Band 2]]'' was released and featured a re-recorded version of "Where'd You Go?" that the band had recorded earlier in the year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rockband.com/songs/wheredyougo |title=Where'd You Go? by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones // Songs // Rock |publisher=Rockband.com |date=2008-09-14 |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref> On 4 November 2008, a MySpace blog announced the recording of a new album, and streamed two new songs, "The Impossible Dream" and "Next to Nothing".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&friendID=12576182&blogID=446395091 |title=Blogs.myspace.com |publisher=Blogs.myspace.com |date=2008-11-05 |access-date=2011-10-26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065936/http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view |archive-date=2009-02-07 }}</ref> On July 29, 2009, the band announced the completion of tracking for the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/mmbosstones/statuses/2921310742 |title=Twitter.com |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2009-07-29 |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref> On October 16, 2009, the album title was announced to be ''[[Pin Points and Gin Joints]]'' and a free download of the song "Graffiti Worth Reading" was made available. The release date was later stated as December 8, 2009.

The band continued to tour through the summer of 2009 with shows in [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[Asbury Park, New Jersey]], [[Seattle, Washington]], [[San Francisco, California]], [[Anaheim, California]], [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire]], and [[Victoria, British Columbia]] where they performed at the [[Victoria Ska Fest]] with [[Voodoo Glow Skulls]], [[The Slackers]] and [[Chris Murray (musician)|Chris Murray]]. The band toured during the summer of 2010 with [[Teenage Bottlerocket]] and [[the Flatliners]]. They also hosted their annual Hometown Throwdown festival over three nights in December, 2010.

In August 2011, Chris Rhodes posted a Facebook update stating that The Mighty Mighty Bosstones had begun work on their next album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/43944 |title=Mighty Mighty Bosstones working on new album |publisher=Punknews.org |access-date=2011-10-26}}</ref> The album, titled ''[[The Magic of Youth]]'', was released on December 6, 2011.

March 2017 saw the release of their first recording in six years with a limited edition vinyl 7" featuring a cover version of the [[Burt Bacharach]] song, "[[What the World Needs Now Is Love]]" backed with the track "I Won’t Go Out Like That". In the time between releases, the lineup saw the addition of former [[Cherry Poppin' Daddies]] keyboard player, John Goetchius in 2008 and Leon Silva in 2016 to replace Kevin Lenear who departed the band for a second time earlier that same year.

In September 2017, Tim Burton announced in a post Riot Fest interview that the band was working on a new album set for release in early 2018. According to guitarist Lawrence Katz and producer Ted Hutt's Instagram accounts, recording started on Friday, November 17 at Kingsize Soundlabs in Los Angeles, California. The new album's title was announced to be ''[[While We're at It]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diffuser.fm/mighty-bosstones-interview/ |title=Dicky Barrett Says the New Bosstones Album Will Be Angry |publisher=diffuser.fm |date=2018-01-10 |access-date=2018-01-10}}</ref>

''While We're at It'', the band's tenth album, was released on June 15, 2018. It is the final part of a musical trilogy that began with ''Pin Points and Gin Joints'' in 2009 followed by ''The Magic of Youth'' in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thepier.org/mighty-mighty-bosstones-to-release-new-album-while-were-at-it/|title=Mighty Mighty BossTones to Release New Album ‘While We’re At It’ « The Pier Magazine}}</ref> For the initial 2018 tour dates supporting the album, Silva could not participate due to his commitments performing with [[Justin Timberlake]]. To temporarily fill in for Silva, the band brought in Roman Fleysher<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qromag.com/interviews/tim-burton-of-the-mighty-mighty-bosstones/ |title=Tim Burton of The Mighty Mighty Bosstones  |publisher=www.qromag.com |access-date=2018-06-30}}</ref> and [[Peter "JR" Wasilewski]] of [[Less Than Jake]] to play saxophone on select dates.

==Big Rig Records==
Big Rig Records started as a vanity label in 1993 due to the band's desire to release their records on vinyl. While the band wanted to release their albums on vinyl, the label had ceased pressing albums in that format. A partnership between Mercury and the band resulted in the label continuing to handle the conventional CD and cassette versions of the albums while allowing the band's Big Rig label to focus on the vinyl editions. The new label immediately issued re-releases of ''Don't Know How To Party'' and ''Ska-Core, The Devil, and More'' on colored vinyl.

Besides the band's own albums, additional releases include the first CD release of Dicky Barrett's previous band Impact Unit, as well as ''Vow Of Poverty'' by the Boston punk band Mung, and ''[[Half Hour Of Power]]'' by [[Sum 41]]. Additionally, the label also released a benefit compilation featuring various artists titled ''Safe And Sound: A Benefit In Response To The Brookline Clinic Violence'', as well as, ''You Decide: Warped Tour 2000 Sampler'', a sampler of bands featured on the 2000 [[Vans Warped Tour]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/77753-Big-Rig|title=Big Rig|website=Discogs}}</ref> The first new release under this partnership was ''Question the Answers'' and it continued through ''Pay Attention'', the band's final album with the Island Def Jam Music Group, the label formed after the merger of Mercury Records, Island Records, and Def Jam Recordings. After leaving Mercury, the vinyl release of ''A Jackknife to a Swan'' was handled directly by SideOneDummy, the band's label at the time. Since the band's return from hiatus, Big Rig has been run exclusively by the Mighty Mighty Bosstones as their own independent record label, handling all of their new releases up until 2021's ''When Got Was Great'', which was released on [[Hellcat Records]].
