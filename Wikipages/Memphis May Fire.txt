===Line-up changes and ''Sleepwalking'' (2008–2009)===
Memphis May Fire had hoped to release their debut album by summer 2006 produced by their guitarist, Kellen McGregor. However, after the recording sessions for the album during tour, lead singer Chase and short time drummer Dooley decided to part ways with the band. Chase explained that he felt that his priorities should be with his child, and not a touring band. Dooley would end his touring back home in St. Louis. Upon announcing their resignations, bass player Tanner Oakes left the tour and the band. Bassist Austin Radford joined the band to finish the tour but would decide to part ways with the band shortly after creating his own band called, American Mantra as the lead singer. He would be replaced by Daniel De Los Santos as a substitute, and then later by Cory Elder, who is a current member. Open auditions were held shortly after Chase's departure with an instrumental song called "Decade" on their MySpace (later known as "Destiny for the Willing"), and he was eventually replaced by a new vocalist, Matty Mullins (Nights in Fire). By this time, Memphis May Fire had already recorded their instruments for the new album with producer Casey Bates and only needed Mullins to contribute his vocals.<ref>{{cite web| last = Kohli| first = Rohan| title = Memphis May Fire Seeking New Singer| publisher = [[AbsolutePunk.net]]| date = August 21, 2008| url = http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=491991| access-date = May 28, 2009 }}</ref>

Their debut full-length studio album, ''[[Sleepwalking (Memphis May Fire album)|Sleepwalking]]'', was released on July 21, 2009, through Trustkill Records. Memphis May Fire has described the album as "a new breed of rock n' roll" and musically it has "more aggressive guitar work and noticeably more melodic, but still retains that southern swagger."<ref>{{cite web|title=Sleepwalking Press Release |publisher=[[Trustkill Records]] website |date=February 11, 2009 |url=http://www.trustkill.com/label/news/comments.php?id=712 |access-date=May 28, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090529050012/http://www.trustkill.com/label/news/comments.php?id=712 |archive-date=May 29, 2009 }}</ref> Their song "Ghost in the Mirror" was used on the soundtrack for the movie ''[[Saw VI]]''.

Seier was featured in "Ghost in the Mirror" and "North Atlantic vs. North Carolina" music videos as the rhythm guitarist.

The official music video for "Ghost in the Mirror" was released February 2, 2010, through the Trustkill YouTube page.<ref>{{cite web|title=Memphis May Fire 'Ghost In The Mirror' Saw VI Soundtrack|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPKiKT-fxnA|publisher=Trustkill|access-date=November 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205093503/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPKiKT-fxnA|archive-date=December 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
