'''Zacarías Ferreíra''' (born October 10, 1968) is a Dominican singer, songwriter, and musician. He is a [[Bachata (music)|Bachata]] artist known worldwide for his hits such as "Es Tan Dificil", "Asesina", "La Mejor de Todas", "Mañana en tu Olvido", "Amiga Veneno", "La Avispa" among others. He is one of the most representative voices in bachata. He is known as "La Voz de la Ternura" because of his soft and melodic voice.

== Early life ==
Ferreíra was born in 1968 in the town of Amaceyes [[Moca, Dominican Republic|Tamboril]], near [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] in the [[Cibao]] region of the north-western [[Dominican Republic]]. Born into a family of musicians and singers, it is not surprising that he dreamed of a musical career as a child. His family filled his childhood home with music spurring Zacarías on to dream of becoming a musical artist.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.zacariasferreirard.com/biografia|title=Zacarias Ferreira - Biografia|website=zacariasferreirademo|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> As a young man, his dream motivated him to leave for the country's capital, [[Santo Domingo]], where he joined the ''Conservatorio Nacional'' and also sang in a local [[Bachata (music)|bachata]] group because he had to "earn a living." Ferreira then became a member of the [[Brugal]] rum company orchestra, where he remained for five years.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/zacar%C3%ADas-ferre%C3%ADra-mn0000690196/biography|title=Zacarías Ferreíra {{!}} Biography & History|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>

== Music career ==
Ferreíra entered onto the bachata scene in 1997 with his debut album, ''Me Liberé''. The album won the prestigious Dominican music award, the Cassandra. Three years later his second album, ''El Triste'', won the award for him for a second time.<ref name=":0" /> Ferreira became the first bachatero to perform at the Festival de [[Presidente (beer)|Presidente]].<ref name=":0" /> In the winter of 2001, Ferreira traveled to the [[United States]] for the first time and played 77 gigs in just six-and-a-half weeks in [[New York City]].<ref name=":0" /> In 2002, He was the first bachatero to perform at the world-renowned S.O.Bs nightclub in Manhattan, New York City.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://mayimbamusic.com/artist/zacarias-ferreira|title=Zacarias Ferreira|website=mayimbamusic.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> Alongside Jose Manuel "El Sultan" and [[Lenny Santos|Lenny]] from Aventura, he is one of the first bachateros to incorporate blues and rock elements into the genre. In 2002, he would record one of his biggest hits of all time, "Amiga Veneno" where he incorporated blues and rock elements like adding the wah effect and an electric guitar solo.<ref name=":1" /> The song would take Ferreíra intro the Latin mainstream. He then continued to release successful albums each year, spawning hits such as "Dime Que Falto", "Cuanto Duele Que Te Vas", "La Bomba", "Quedate Conmigo", "Me ilusioné", "Diez Segundos (feat. Yenddi)", "Te Lo Pido a Gritos", and many more. In 2019, Ferreíra was featured in the song "Me Quedo" with [[Romeo Santos]]. The song is off Romeo's album, Utopía.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.conectate.com.do/articulo/zacarias-ferreira-biografia-discografia/|title=Zacarias Ferreira Biografía {{!}} Discografia|date=2019-07-10|language=es|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>
