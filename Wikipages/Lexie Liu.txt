In February 2019, Liu released her debut EP ''2030'' in the United States, which included two new singles "Outta Time" featuring [[Killy (rapper)|Killy]] and "Love and Run".<ref>{{Citation|title=2030 by Lexie Liu|url=https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/2030/1451006920|language=en-ca|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allure.com/story/lexie-liu-chinese-rapper-beauty-interview|title=Why Chinese Rapper Lexie Liu Is All About Having a Signature Minimalist Look|last=Nast|first=Condé|website=Allure|language=en|access-date=2019-02-14}}</ref>

On October 28, 2020, Liu voiced the champion Seraphine in [[Riot Games]]' virtual K-pop group, [[K/DA]], in their new song "[[More (K/DA song)|More]]" from their [[extended play]] ''[[All Out (EP)|All Out]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.invenglobal.com/articles/12501/kda-all-out-ep-to-feature-g-idle-kim-petras-madison-beer-lexie-liu-twice-and-more|title=K/DA ALL OUT EP to feature (G)-IDLE, Kim Petras, Madison Beer, Lexie Liu, TWICE, and more|website=Invenglobal|author=Lara Lunardi

On January 28, 2021, Liu released her second EP ''GONE GOLD'' internationally (released as ''Online 上线了'' in China), featuring her then-newest single "ALGTR" which was self-written and self-produced alongside the rest of the EP.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://radiichina.com/lexie-liu-gone-gold/|title=Gone Gold: Lexie Liu On Her New Musical Direction and Having "the Courage to Reshape the Future"|website=Radii China|author=Jake Newby
|date=January 28, 2021}}</ref> It marked yet another change in sound direction, with the EP taking in significantly more electro-pop influences compared to previous efforts. The project's contemporary theme, reflected in the title track's music videos and the rest of the track list's visualisers which were directed by frequent collaborator Jeremy Z. Qin, revolves around the idea of living in an online game as a character. It was inspired by the unrest experienced throughout 2020 as a result of the worldwide [[COVID-19 pandemic]], where Liu's only source of understanding the world was solely through a screen - leading her to imagine what life would be like without this source.

"Lexie Liu is spearheading the new generation of East Asian artists making waves in the global music industry.

After the release of her single "Like A Mercedes", the cyberpunk-inspired music video of the song was Lexie Liu's first introduction to a global audience, showing off how "her provocative sound is transcending language barriers."<ref>[http://i-d.vice.cn/read/meet-88risings-newest-signing-chinese-randb-star-lexie-liu 认识 88Rising 的流行新星：Lexie Liu 刘柏辛] 2018-06-20 i-D</ref>

Her debut EP released in February 2019 was highly recommended, "with a feature from [[Killy (rapper)|Killy]] on Outta Time, plus new singles Sleep Away, Hat Trick and Nada, the eight-tracker is an impressive bilingual project showcasing the Changsha born and raised artist’s skills across rap, R&B vocals and production."<ref>[https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/xwbdb3/lexie-liu-88rising-2030-ep lexie liu’s debut ep and everything else you need to listen to today] 2019-02-01 i-D</ref>
