'''3T''' is an American [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]]/[[pop music]] trio featuring the three sons of [[Tito Jackson]] (from [[the Jackson 5]]) and Delores "Dee Dee" Jackson, from whom they inherit their Dominican ancestry. The band members include, from eldest; Toriano Adaryll Jackson, Jr. (also known as Taj), Taryll Adren Jackson, and [[T. J. Jackson (singer)|Tito Joe Jackson]] (also known as T. J.). Their uncle, [[Michael Jackson]], mentored the trio and signed them to his label, [[MJJ Music]].

==History==

===''Brotherhood'' (1995–1997)===
3T released their debut album ''[[Brotherhood (3T album)|Brotherhood]]'' in 1995. The album sold approximately three million copies worldwide. The group achieved an international [[chart-topper|hit]] with their debut [[single (music)|single]] "[[Anything (3T song)|Anything]]". 3T released several hit singles in Europe, including "24/7", "Why" (a [[duet (music)|duet]] with their uncle [[Michael Jackson]]), "[[I Need You (3T song)|I Need You]]" (with a brief appearance by Michael), "Tease Me" and "Gotta Be You". In 1996, they were ranked second behind the [[Spice Girls]], as the biggest-selling group in Europe. 3T have also written and produced songs for [[soundtrack]]s to [[motion pictures|films]] such as; ''[[The Jacksons: An American Dream]]'', ''[[Free Willy]]'', ''[[Free Willy 2: The Adventure Home]]'', ''[[Men in Black (1997 film)|Men in Black]]'' and ''[[Trippin' (film)|Trippin']]''. In early 1997, they went on a hugely successful European tour with their album ''Brotherhood'', which included all of the songs from the album, as well as a Jackson 5 tribute (featuring Tito 'Poppa T'), and a surprise performance of the [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] hit, "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]".

3T completed an album after the release of ''Brotherhood'', with over 20 songs being recorded and 12 planned to be included on the final tracklist. The album was never released by Sony due to a strained relationship with [[Michael Jackson]] (MJJ Music), and is considered by many fans to be ''The Lost Album''.<ref>[http://www.3t.com/music/albums/76-the-lost-album "The Lost Album"]. 3T.com. Retrieved: 2014-08-12</ref>

===''Identity'' (2003–2005)===
Taryll and T. J. have written/produced tracks for their aunt [[Janet Jackson]] as well as for [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Bruno Mars]]. After signing with the French label TF1/NRJ in [[2003 in music|2003]], 3T continued to perform in [[France]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]]. The group signed with the Dutch label Digidance in 2004 for Dutch releases, appearances, and performances. The album titled ''[[Identity (3T album)|Identity]]'' was released on March 23, 2004. Two singles were released: "[[Stuck on You (Lionel Richie song)#3T version|Stuck On You]]" (a cover of the [[Lionel Richie]] song) was released in 2003 in France and Belgium and in 2004 in the Netherlands, and "Sex Appeal" in 2004. Neither single was released outside of Europe. In 2008, 3T made ''Identity'' available on both [[iTunes]] and [[amazon.com]] worldwide.

===On-and-off appearances (2007–2011)===
The brothers appeared on the show ''This Is David Gest'' in 2007, including recording the theme tune "Crazy Kinda Guy". The show began on April 22, 2007. They appeared in an episode where Gest took cameras for a rare glimpse of the Jackson family house in Encino, California, where he met Tito and 3T as well as matriarch [[Katherine Jackson]], as well as a later episode showing them recording the theme tune. The brothers would occasionally bring Jermajesty Jackson on tour as an on and off DJ.

During the summer of 2008, the Jackson family (including Tito) stayed at a holiday let (rental) for six weeks in [[Appledore, Torridge, Devon|Appledore]], [[Devon]], [[England]] while searching for a house to buy in the area. The project was filmed for a [[Channel 4]] documentary called ''The Jacksons are Coming'', which was aired in 2008. Taj and T. J. appear with their father, but Taryll did not join them on the trip. The three family members also attended a Michael Jackson fan event in Devon as part of their stay, ringing him up during the event which led to Michael talking to the fans over a loudspeaker on the phone.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583492/The-Jacksons-to-hit-reality-TV---in-Devon.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603064212/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1583492/The-Jacksons-to-hit-reality-TV---in-Devon.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=2008-06-03 | title=The Jacksons to hit reality TV - in Devon | work=[[Telegraph.co.uk]] | publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] | date=2008-04-02 | access-date=2009-03-20 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article5247250.ece?openComment=true | title=Last Night's TV: The Jacksons Are Coming | first=Mick | last=Hume | work=[[The Times]] | publisher=[[Times Newspapers]] | date=2008-11-28 | access-date=2009-03-20 | location=London}}</ref>
