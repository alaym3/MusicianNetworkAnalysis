'''Saves the Day''' is an American [[rock music|rock]] band from [[Princeton, New Jersey]], formed in 1997. The band currently consists of lead vocalist and guitarist [[Chris Conley]], guitarist Arun Bali, and bassist Rodrigo Palma.

After forming under the name Sefler in 1994, Saves the Day released their debut studio album, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Saves the Day album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', in 1998. It was followed by ''[[Through Being Cool]]'' (1999), which featured their first single, "Shoulder to the Wheel". ''[[Stay What You Are]]'' was released in 2001, peaking at number 100 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. It spawned two successful music videos on [[MTV2]], for the singles "At Your Funeral" and "Freakish", and has since sold 300,000 copies.<ref name="Allm">{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p311722/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Saves The Day > Biography|publisher=Allmusic|access-date=2009-03-13}}</ref> After the success of ''Stay What You Are'', Saves the Day signed to [[Dreamworks Records]], who co-released their next studio album, ''[[In Reverie]]'', with [[Vagrant Records]].

== History ==

=== Formation and first releases ===
''Saves the Day'' originally performed in the [[New Jersey]] area under the name Sefler as a four-piece band with Chris Conley on bass guitar and vocals. The band changed their name in late 1997. Of the original lineup, only Conley remains today. The band has gone through numerous lineup changes over the years and has only recorded two consecutive albums with the same lineup (''[[Through Being Cool]]'' and  ''[[Stay What You Are]]''), with Conley as the only permanent fixture.

The band's first proper release, ''[[Can't Slow Down (Saves the Day album)|Can't Slow Down]]'', was recorded and released through [[Equal Vision Records]] in 1998 while the members were still in high school.

Using their own resources, ''Saves the Day'' released a five-song acoustic [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[I'm Sorry I'm Leaving EP|I'm Sorry I'm Leaving]]'', in early 1999. Later that year, they released their second full-length with Equal Vision, ''Through Being Cool'', which saw the band further refining their melodic sound. The band began drawing attention from some of the larger independent labels, eventually signing with [[Vagrant Records]].

=== ''Stay What You Are'' and commercial exposure ===
In 2001, the band began moving away from their roots with the release of ''[[Stay What You Are]]''. The album had a poppier feel with more intricate guitar work and arrangements rather than the previous power chord-based sound. The band gained some exposure with a video for the song ''"At Your Funeral"'', and made appearances on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien|Conan O'Brien]]'' and ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn]]''. The band also released a video for ''"Freakish"'' in April 2002; the video featuring [[The Muppets|Muppet]]-esque puppets. Shortly after the album's release, guitarist [[Ted Alexander (musician)|Ted Alexander]] left the band and Conley took over guitar duties. The album was also original drummer [[Bryan Newman (musician)|Bryan Newman]]'s last recording with the band, who also left shortly after the album's release. The album artwork featured photographs taken by the photo duo [[Day19]].

=== Major label signing for ''In Reverie'' ===
With the success of ''Stay What You Are'', the band signed with major label [[DreamWorks Records]], who would co-release their next album with [[Vagrant Records|Vagrant]], who still had the band under contract. The 2003 release of ''[[In Reverie]]'' saw the band further experiment with their sound and featured less macabre lyrics than past recordings. The drastic change in sound was alienating among fans, and the album received little support from ''DreamWorks''. The song ''"Anywhere With You"'' was released as a single, but went largely unnoticed, despite the album peaking at 27 on the ''[[Billboard 200|Billboard Top 200 albums chart]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Conley later said the following about the album's release in an interview with ''Skratch Magazine'':

<blockquote>
"[[DreamWorks Records]] completely abandoned it three days after it was released, saying that we made the wrong record. Then they were sold a month later. They were worthless."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=169|title=Interview — Saves The Day|work=Skratch Magazine, Issue 122|access-date=2009-03-14|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024153506/http://www.skratchmagazine.com/interviews/interviews.php?id=169|archive-date=2008-10-24}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Shortly after the album's release, DreamWorks Records was absorbed by ''[[Interscope Records|Interscope]]'', who would eventually drop the band from its roster.

=== ''Ups and Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides'' ===
The band finally fulfilled their contractual obligations with Vagrant Records in 2004 with the release of ''[[Ups and Downs (album)|Ups and Downs: Early Recordings and B-Sides]]'', which was a collection of [[A-side and B-side|b-sides]] and included the ''[[I'm Sorry I'm Leaving EP|I'm Sorry I'm Leaving]]'' EP. ''Ups and Downs'' also featured a song from the band's early days under the name ''Sefler''. Conley said in an [[Alternative Press (music magazine)|AP]] Podcast interview that the wrong ''Sefler'' song had been put on the CD. He had asked for a different one but when he received the final version he discovered it was the wrong one. The album was dedicated to former bassist [[Sean McGrath (bassist)|Sean McGrath]], who died in 2004 at age 28 after a two-year battle with [[Colorectal cancer|intestinal cancer]]. McGrath recorded with the band on ''[[Can't Slow Down (Saves the Day album)|Can't Slow Down]]'' and had left during the writing of ''[[Through Being Cool]]''. The band was relatively inactive in 2004, though during that time they set up their own studio, ''[[The Electric Ladybug]]'', located in [[Chico, California]].

=== Three-part concept: ''Sound the Alarm'', ''Under the Boards'' and ''Daybreak'' ===
In early 2005, the band began writing their follow-up to ''In Reverie'' without a label. During the writing process, longtime bassist [[Eben D'amico]] left the band. He was replaced by ''[[Glassjaw]]'' bassist [[Manuel Carrero]].

The band recorded their fifth studio album, ''[[Sound the Alarm (Saves the Day album)|Sound the Alarm]]'', in 2005, without a label. The band announced in January 2006 that they had re-signed with [[Vagrant Records|Vagrant]], who would release ''Sound the Alarm'' in April.<ref name="Allm"/> The album marked a return to the band's macabre lyrics and drew more from their influences than ''In Reverie'' had. During the ''Sound the Alarm'' recording sessions, the band also recorded an EP of acoustic versions of several songs from past albums, which was sold on tour throughout 2006 as ''[[The Bug Sessions|Bug Sessions Volume One]]''. The band toured extensively throughout 2006 and early 2007 in support of the album. It was announced that ''Sound the Alarm'' was part one of a three part concept. The next album in the trilogy was released in 2007, titled ''"[[Under the Boards]]"''. The final album in the series, ''"[[Daybreak (Saves the Day album)|Daybreak]]"'', was released in September 2011 after a very long wait by fans.

In February 2007, they announced that thirteen demos had already been recorded for a new album, which would be titled ''[[Under the Boards]]''. It was also revealed that this would be the second of a three-part concept involving ''''Sound the Alarm'', ''Under the Boards'' and the yet to be released ''Daybreak''.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web|url=http://au.music.ign.com/articles/813/813506p1.html|title=Saves The Day Go Under the Boards|publisher=IGN|access-date=2009-03-13}}</ref> Chris Conley said that "''Sound the Alarm'' is an expression of discontent. ''Under the Boards'' is reflection and remorse. ''Daybreak'' is acceptance."<ref name="IGN"/>
Conley also said about the three-album concept: "The whole trilogy was just a bit of a therapeutic experiment. I felt like all twisted up and broken inside and just angry and confused and depressed and sad and I couldn’t really deal with the world or myself. So I was just like ′this has got to end, I have to at least try and get a grip on the world and on myself′. So I dove into the depths of my mind and brought out what I was finding, so the first album was filled with all the anger, the surface pain, and all the paranoid delusional thoughts that were there. The second album, ''Under the Boards'', dealt with how all of that was making my life unbearable, and I realized I had to change, so that album was the transitional part, starting to transition out of that dark place, because you realize how it's affecting your life. So ''Daybreak'' is coming to terms with everything and trying to understand why I actually got that way and learning to accept it by exploring what it is and why it was there and simultaneously trying to grow through it and be a better person, not purely full of anger."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewrinserepeat.com/interview/saves-the-day/2010-11-23 |title=Saves The Day |publisher=Review Rinse Repeat |access-date=2010-12-25}}</ref>

In March 2007, after more than four years with the band, drummer [[Pete Parada]] left ''Saves the Day'' to join ''[[the Offspring]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.offspring.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Offspring.woa/wa/news?newsID%3D433744 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-07-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070911231654/http://offspring.com/cgi-bin/WebObjects/Offspring.woa/wa/news?newsID=433744 |archive-date=2007-09-11 }}</ref> Carrero's Glassjaw bandmate [[Durijah Lang]] took over drum duties, and recorded on ''Under the Boards''. The album was released on October 30, 2007, through [[Vagrant Records]].

Chris Conley said in an interview that the next ''Bug Sessions'' would be a collection of live songs recorded on their 30-date acoustic tour. Volumes 2 and 3 of the once-tour-exclusive EPs were originally only sold on tour, but are now on the [[iTunes Music Store]]. After a string of shows on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] in late October 2008, ''Saves the Day'' planned to enter the studio to begin work on their next studio album, ''[[Daybreak (Saves the Day album)|Daybreak]]''.

''Saves the Day'' began working on ''Daybreak'' in 2009. It was announced in March 2009 that longstanding guitarist [[David Soloway]], would no longer be playing for ''Saves the Day''. He continues to play bass for his side project [[Two Tongues]] with Chris Conley. In April, Arun Bali was announced as Soloway's replacement.<ref name="Rocklouder">{{cite web|url=http://www.rocklouder.co.uk/articles/7344/Saves-The-Day-Reveal-New-Guitarist.html|title=Saves The Day Reveal New Guitarist|publisher=Rocklouder|access-date=2009-04-14}}</ref> Continuing this string of events, on December 21, it was announced that bassist Manuel Carrero and drummer Durijah Lang would be leaving to focus on ''[[Glassjaw]]''. They were replaced by [[Rodrigo Palma]] on bass and [[Spencer Peterson]] on drums (Ex-[[Hidden In Plain View]]).

In September 2010, Peterson's personal website announced that he had left ''Saves the Day'' and joined [[Fall Out Boy]]'s [[Pete Wentz]]'s new [[electropop]] group ''[[Black Cards]]''. About two weeks later, drummer [[Claudio Rivera]]'s personal website announced that he had joined ''Saves the Day''. In October 2010, the band announced that they would be selling [[dropcards]] to access a digital-only EP, called ''"1984"'', while on tour with ''[[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]]'' and ''[[Motion City Soundtrack]]''. The EP contains the track ''"1984"'' from the upcoming album.

''[[Daybreak (Saves the Day album)|Daybreak]]'' was released on September 13, 2011, through [[Razor & Tie]], after several delays during the previous two years. This was the first time ''Saves the Day'' had released an album without a single band member (besides Conley) having played on an earlier record.

=== ''Saves the Day'' ===
In a December 2011 interview, Chris Conley revealed that an eighth ''Saves the Day'' album was in the works and that he was hoping that the band would be back in the studio in the fall of 2012 to record it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thenjunderground.com/blog/2011/12/20/interview-saves-the-day.html|title=Interview: Saves The Day - Reviews - Fake Walls|work=thenjunderground.com|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> On November 23, 2012, ''Saves the Day'' announced they were making a new record but wanted the fans to get involved. They signed up on ''[[PledgeMusic]]'' and offered fans everything from free downloads and album updates to limited edition T-shirts, tickets to a shows, and private house shows. They released a demo to 'pledgers' of one of the songs on the new album, ''"Ain't No Kind of Love"'', when pledging started. For Christmas 2012, they did a cover of ''Baby Please Come Home''; and in the new year, ''[[Weezer]]'s'', ''"Across the Sea"''. ''Saves the Day'' released a music video for their song ''"Ring Pop"'' on [[YouTube]]. The album, titled ''"Saves the Day"'', was released on September 17, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/savestheday/|title=Saves The Day: New Album|work=pledgemusic.com|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>
On May 20, 2013, it was announced that [[Dennis Wilson (musician)|Dennis Wilson]] had joined the band on a permanent basis, replacing former drummer Claudio Rivera.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=3196561/|title=chorus.fm|work=absolutepunk.net|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>
After the album was released, the band did two tours. A headlining tour around [[North America]] with ''[[Into It. Over It.]]'' and ''[[Hostage Calm supporting]]''. They also did a holiday acoustic tour in North America with [[Walter Schreifels]] and [[Jon Simmons (musician)|Jon Simmons]].

In 2014, ''Saves the Day'' supported ''[[Brand New (band)|Brand New]]'' on their [[UK|British]] tour.

On September 4, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.punknews.org/article/55868/tours-say-anything-saves-the-day-reggie-and-the-full-effect|title=Tours: Say Anything / Saves The Day / Reggie and the Full Effect|website=Punknews.org|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref> Saves the Day and [[Say Anything (band)|Say Anything]] announced a co-headlining tour with support from [[Reggie and the Full Effect]]. The three bands were celebrating anniversaries. Saves The Day celebrated 15 years since Through Being Cool; Say Anything had the 10th anniversary of [[...Is a Real Boy]], and Reggie celebrated [[Under The Tray]].

=== ''9'' ===
On February 26, 2016, Chris Conley tweeted about the "first song on the next saves the day record" being his "new favorite song of all time."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ChrisLaneConley/status/703205017294082048|title=CLC on Twitter|work=twitter.com|access-date=16 September 2016}}</ref>
