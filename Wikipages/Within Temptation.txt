'''Within Temptation''' is a Dutch [[symphonic metal]] band founded in April 1996 by vocalist [[Sharon den Adel]] and guitarist [[Robert Westerholt]].<ref name="bandbiography">{{cite web|last=Within Temptation|title=Official Biography|url=http://www.within-temptation.com/nl/index.php?c=band|access-date=12 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813134532/http://www.within-temptation.com/nl/index.php?c=band |archive-date = 13 August 2007}}</ref> They have been classified by critics as [[gothic metal]] and [[symphonic metal]], although each album contains other influences outside these genres.

After the release of their debut album ''[[Enter (Within Temptation album)|Enter]]'' in 1997, the band became prominent in the Dutch underground scene. It was not until 2001 that they became known to the general public, with the single "[[Ice Queen (song)|Ice Queen]]" from their second album ''[[Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)|Mother Earth]]'', which reached No. 2 on the Dutch charts.<ref name="bandbiography"/> This was followed by the band winning the [[Buma Export Award|Conamus Exportprijs]],<ref name="conamus">{{cite web|title=Conamus Exportprijs|url=http://www.conamus.nl/index.php?p=page.php%3FpageAlias%3Dcona.nl.harpengala|access-date=12 May 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504004618/http://www.conamus.nl/index.php?p=page.php%3FpageAlias%3Dcona.nl.harpengala|archive-date=4 May 2006}}</ref> a Dutch music award, four years in a row, and a fifth in 2016. Their next albums ''[[The Silent Force]]'' (2004) and ''[[The Heart of Everything]]'' (2007) debuted at No. 1 on the Dutch charts. In 2008, they released ''[[Black Symphony]]'', a [[live album]] recorded with the [[Metropole Orkest|Metropole Orchestra]]. This was followed in 2009 by ''[[An Acoustic Night at the Theatre]]'', another live album, this time with [[Acoustic music|acoustic]] renditions of the songs.

The band's fifth studio album, ''[[The Unforgiving]]'', was released in March 2011 and was one part of a [[transmedia]] effort, alongside both a [[comic book]] series and a series of [[short film]]s that together encompass a [[Concept album|story]]. The album saw the band increasingly venturing on new musical territories outside symphonic metal. Their sixth studio album, ''[[Hydra (Within Temptation album)|Hydra]]'', was released in early 2014 in Japan, Europe, and the United States. The album advanced the band's exploration of new musical genres and features guest appearances from various artists: Finnish singer [[Tarja Turunen]], who appears in the lead single "[[Paradise (What About Us?)]]"; [[Howard Jones (American musician)|Howard Jones]], former vocalist of American metalcore band [[Killswitch Engage]]; [[Dave Pirner]], lead vocalist of American alternative rock band [[Soul Asylum]]; and American rapper [[Xzibit]]. The band had extensive airplay on [[BBC Radio 2]] in the United Kingdom with one of the songs from the album, "[[Whole World Is Watching]]" featuring Pirner.

Their latest studio album, ''[[Resist (Within Temptation album)|Resist]]'', was released in January 2019 and incorporates influences from other musical styles such as [[industrial metal|industrial]] and [[Electronic dance music|EDM]]. By 2016, the band had already sold more than 3.5&nbsp;million albums worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAFw13FhPF8 |title=Within Temptation @ De Wereld Draait Door (ENG SUB) |publisher=YouTube |date=11 August 2011 |access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Records |first=Roadrunner |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/within-temptation-the-unforgiving-concept-album-coming-march-2011 |title=Within Temptation: 'The Unforgiving' Concept Album Coming March 2011 |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=12 July 2011 |access-date=13 November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nl |first=Nu |url=http://www.nu.nl/muziek/4272609/within-temptation-wint-buma-rocks-export-award.html |title=Within Temptation wint Buma Rocks!

==History==

===Formation===
Long-term partners Robert Westerholt (guitar) and [[Sharon den Adel]] (vocals) began the band in 1996,<ref name="bandbiography" /> after Westerholt left his previous band, The Circle. The Circle renamed themselves ''Voyage'' and released an album called Embrace, including a song featuring den Adel. Soon after that release the band broke up.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.popinstituut.nl/Encyclopedia/Artist.aspx?id=3127&name=Voyage |title=Muziek Centrum Nederland – Voyage |publisher=Popinstituut.nl |date=14 July 2009 |access-date=15 April 2010 }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=NWWT |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Westerholt then joined with den Adel in forming a doom metal band called, "The Portal", including former The Circle band members [[Jeroen van Veen (bassist)|Jeroen van Veen]] on [[bass guitar]] and Michiel Papenhove on guitar, as well as [[Martijn Westerholt]] on the [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] and [[Dennis Leeflang]] on drums (later replaced by [[Ivar de Graaf]]). However, they renamed themselves "Within Temptation", before they started recording their demo, ''Enter''. The ''Enter'' demo contained some songs that would later be released in their first album. They were offered a recording contract and signed to [[DSFA Records]]<ref name="bandbiography" /> later that year, beginning work on their first album.

===''Enter'' and first national tour (1997–1999)===
''[[Enter (Within Temptation album)|Enter]]'', the debut album, was released in 1997. The album was well received and the band embarked on a four gig tour across the country, after which they performed at the ''[[Dynamo Open Air]]''<ref name="dynamo">{{cite web|url=http://www.dynamo.nl/history.html|title=Dynamo Open Air 2005|author=Andre|date=18 February 2005|publisher=[[Dynamo Open Air]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413235052/http://www.dynamo.nl/history.html|archive-date=13 April 2010|access-date=9 December 2014}}</ref> festival in [[Eindhoven]]. The band rounded out 1997 by embarking on their first international tour, of Germany and Austria. Also subsequently Ivar de Graaf left the band and was replaced by Ciro Palma.<ref name="Sharpe-YoungPage294"/>

The sound of ''Enter'', whilst melodic, was doomily paced, and influenced by gothic doom metal, heavily reliant on slow keyboards and drums and repetitive guitar riffs.<ref name="musicaldiscoveries">{{cite web|last=Farrell|first=Charlie|title=Within Temptation at Musical Discoveries|url=http://www.musicaldiscoveries.com/reviews/wt.htm|access-date=12 May 2007}}</ref><ref name="vpro">{{cite web|last=Bijl|first=Peter|title=Utrechts metaltrots Orphanage uit elkaar|url=http://3voor12lokaal.vpro.nl/magazines/news/index.jsp?portals=6337&magazines=6338&news=202326|access-date=1 May 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060322145236/http://3voor12lokaal.vpro.nl/magazines/news/index.jsp?portals=6337&magazines=6338&news=202326 |archive-date = 22 March 2006}}</ref> Also prominent on this album are [[death grunts]] by Robert Westerholt and George Oosthoek, ex-member of [[Orphanage (band)|Orphanage]].

In 1998 the band continued to tour – their profile had elevated them to the main stage at ''Dynamo'' for the 1998 event. However, Within Temptation had released no new material (and did not have plans for a second album at this point), to which end they elected to release an [[Extended play|EP]], ''[[The Dance (EP)|The Dance]]'', with three songs (plus two remixes) that would further mature the sound from Enter.

Finally taking a break from touring, 1999 was largely a sabbatical year for the band. They took the opportunity to construct their own studio, as well as returning to personal pursuits, with plans to return to the fold the next year.

===''Mother Earth'' and national breakthrough (2000–2003)===
{{Main|Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)}}
2000 was an eventful year for the band as they returned to touring, playing three Dutch festivals; ''Waterpop'', ''Bospop'' and ''[[A Campingflight to Lowlands Paradise|Lowlands]]''. In addition they went to work on their second album, releasing ''[[Mother Earth (Within Temptation album)|Mother Earth]]'' in the [[Low Countries]] on 1 December. The album was a moderate success in the Dutch charts the first few weeks after its release.<ref name="AlbumTop100-MotherEarth">{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Within+Temptation&titel=Mother+Earth&cat=a |title=Mother Earth in the Dutch Charts |publisher=Dutchcharts.nl |access-date=15 April 2010}}</ref>

The band released the single "[[Our Farewell]]", which never entered the charts. The second single from Mother Earth, "[[Ice Queen (song)|Ice Queen]]", was regarded as the breakthrough release for the band; in March 2002 it climbed to No. 2<ref>{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Within+Temptation&titel=Ice+Queen&cat=s |title=Ice Queen in the Dutch Charts |publisher=Dutchcharts.nl |access-date=15 April 2010}}</ref> in the Netherlands but was their first No. 1 single when it climbed to the top in Belgium. The success rebounded to ''Mother Earth'', which continued to climb in the Dutch album chart, ending the year at No. 3.<ref name="AlbumTop100-MotherEarth" />

2001 saw a number of changes in personnel; [[Ruud Jolie]] was added as a second guitarist, drummer [[Ivar de Graaf]] was replaced by [[Stephen van Haestregt]], and [[Martijn Westerholt]] (suffering from [[infectious mononucleosis]]) was replaced by [[Martijn Spierenburg]]. Westerholt later started the band [[Delain]].

In 2002 they had their first concert in France and a headline gig in [[Mexico City]]. They attained their first major award, the Dutch ''Silver Harp''. They bolstered this by embarking on a major international tour supporting Paradise Lost in 2003 and re-releasing ''Mother Earth'' on the [[GUN Records]] label across more European countries; it was a success in Germany, where it went platinum and reached No. 7 in the charts; the re-release of "Ice Queen" also charted well in the top 30. In turn the [[Benelux]] regions got a different release, a cover of [[Kate Bush]]'s ''"[[Running Up that Hill (EP)|Running Up that Hill]]"''. The band headlined music festivals across the Netherlands, while their ''Mother Earth'' tour DVD claimed the prestigious [[The Edison Award|Edison Award]]. Promotion of ''Mother Earth'' in newer markets continued well into 2004 with various international festival appearances (such as [[M'era Luna]], [[Rock Werchter]], and [[Pukkelpop]]) and other headline gigs, which also saw the band make their [[United Kingdom|UK]] live debut in [[London]] in September of that year.

===''The Silent Force'' and further recognition (2004–2006)===
{{Main|The Silent Force|The Silent Force Tour (Within Temptation tour)}}
[[Image:Within Temptation Metalway 2006 cropped.jpg|thumb|right|The band presented at several big European festivals, which led the band to perform to great major audiences.]]
Plans for the band's third album came to fruition in 2004, with the release of ''[[The Silent Force]]'' on 15 November 2004, across Europe. It was produced by Daniel Gibson and an instant No. 1<ref name="AlbumTop100-SilentForce">{{cite web|author=Steffen Hung |url=http://www.dutchcharts.nl/showitem.asp?interpret=Within+Temptation&titel=The+Silent+Force&cat=a |title=Within Temptation – The Silent Force |publisher=dutchcharts.nl |access-date=15 April 2010}}</ref> in the Netherlands and charted well in many European countries. In support of the release they embarked on another large [[The Silent Force Tour (Within Temptation tour)|international tour]] in 2005, with dates across Europe (including their first festival appearance in the United Kingdom headlining the [[Bloodstock Open Air#Bloodstock Indoor Festival|Bloodstock festival]]) and a one-off show in [[Dubai]]. As of early 2005, the album had already sold more than 400.000 copies only in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=40428 |title=Within Temptation: 'The Silent Force' Certified Gold In Finland |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=14 August 2005 |access-date=13 November 2013}}</ref> "[[Stand My Ground]]" and "[[Memories (Within Temptation song)|Memories]]", the first singles from the new album, continued the band's run of chart success, culminating in a second Edison Award. The third single was "[[Angels (Within Temptation song)|Angels]]". "Stand My Ground" was later to be promoted on the trailer for the film ''[[Blood and Chocolate (film)|Blood and Chocolate]]''. The band also provided some of the soundtrack to the video game ''[[Knights of the Temple: Infernal Crusade]]'' released in March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/knights-of-the-temple-infernal-crusade/cover-art/gameCoverId,38137/ |title=Within Temptation provide knights of the temple video game soundtrack |publisher=mobygames.com |access-date=15 April 2010}}</ref>

In January 2006, Within Temptation won the ''Dutch Pop Prize'' (best Dutch contribution) and ''Dutch Export Prize'' (best-selling Dutch artist outside the Netherlands); the latter one given to them for the third time in a row. The band also reported that they were busy working on their next album, due to be released during the fall and that they would start playing at festivals starting in April, in addition to going on an international tour at the end of the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=47539 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET – WITHIN TEMPTATION Receive Awards For Success at Home And Abroad |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=15 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509204541/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=47539 |archive-date=9 May 2009 }}</ref> Although already being successful in Europe, it was not until 5 August 2008, that both ''Mother Earth'' and ''The Silent Force'' albums were released in the North American market for the first time, through [[Roadrunner Records]].

The album ''[[The Heart of Everything]]'' from Within Temptation was released on 9 March 2007, in the Netherlands, and in the United States on 24 July. Two tracks, called "The Howling" and "Sounds of Freedom", were recorded as promotion material for the video game ''[[The Chronicles of Spellborn]]'', and the first of these opens the album. The full track listing was revealed on 10 January.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/news/story.aspx?newsitemID=14606 |title=Roadrunner Records |publisher=Roadrunner Records |access-date=15 April 2010}}</ref> The album debuted at No. 1 in the Dutch Album 100, making it their second number-one album.

The song "[[What Have You Done]]" was the first single released from the album. Its initial [[music video]] was recorded on the  12, 13 and 14 December 2006 at the Koko club in London, and a CGI studio in Windsor. It features [[Mina Caputo]] of [[Life of Agony]] on guest vocals. Fans were allowed to participate in the making of the video, although this first version left the band feeling disappointed (comments made by the band at their March show in Lyon). Shortly after, a completely new video for the song was made. The second single, released across Europe in June, was "[[Frozen (Within Temptation song)|Frozen]]". The video, filmed in Romania, deals with child abuse, and sales of the single was to raise money for a children's charity, Child Helpline International. "The Howling" was chosen as a digital single release for the UK (not to be confused with the US EP release), and another video was also shot. The extended version of the "Frozen" single features an unreleased b-side, "Sounds of Freedom", as mentioned the second song written for the promotion of the computer game ''The Chronicles of Spellborn''. [[Roadrunner Records]] also released a limited edition [[Extended play|EP]] called ''[[The Howling (EP)|The Howling]]'', which was available only at [[Hot Topic]] stores, containing the title track plus popular tracks from their former album ''The Silent Force''.

Within Temptation started their very first United States tour a few months after the European release of ''The Heart of Everything'', supporting [[Lacuna Coil]], and appearing alongside [[In This Moment]], [[Stolen Babies]], [[The Gathering (band)|The Gathering]], and [[Kylesa]]. The tour, dubbed [[The Hottest Chicks in Metal Tour 2007]], was largely a success. ''The Heart of Everything'' was then released there on 24 July, and the promotional single of "What Have You Done" shipped to rock stations 2 July. This was the band's first album to be released in America followed by the previous albums ''Mother Earth'' and ''The Silent Force'' a year later.

[[File:Bevrijdingsfestival 2008 - Within Tempation 02 cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Within Temptation at the 2008 edition of the Bevrijdingsfestival, in [[Groningen]], Netherlands.]]In support of the new album, Within Temptation decided to kick off their first headlining US tour in Fall 2007. The band played 13 shows, starting on 5 September 2007, in [[Boston]] and ended on 23 September 2007, in [[Tempe, Arizona]].

On 19 October 2007, Within Temptation released the video for their third single "[[All I Need (Within Temptation song)|All I Need]]". The single was released in Europe around 12 November and features the single and album versions of the title track plus demo versions of "The Last Time" (previously unreleased track), "Frozen" and "Our Solemn Hour".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27018_0_2_0_C |title=Brand new single for Within Temptation |publisher=Side-line.com |access-date=15 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090510020930/http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=27018_0_2_0_C |archive-date=10 May 2009 }}</ref>

In November 2007, the band released info that their concert at Beursgebouw, in [[Eindhoven]], was filmed for possible inclusion on a new concert DVD (either parts or all of the show). On 7 February 2008, the band performed a 10,000 audience show entitled ''[[Black Symphony]]'' at the Ahoy in Nederlands together with The Metropole Orchestra, a choir and several guest artists, and it was later revealed that this show would be filmed in its entirety for DVD and [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] together with a double CD, which was to be released on 22 September 2008 (international) and 23 September 2008 (in the US). The trailer for the DVD (containing the entire live performance of the song "Our Solemn Hour" from the show) was released on the band's Opendisc feature on 16 July 2008. Another single from ''The Heart of Everything'', [[Forgiven (Within Temptation song)|Forgiven]], was released to promote the Black Symphony release. Later, Black Symphony was certified Gold in the Netherlands.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net//news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116912 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710015740/http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net//news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=116912 |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=BLABBERMOUTH.NET - WITHIN TEMPTATION: 'Black Symphony' DVD Certified Gold In Holland |publisher=Legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com |access-date=16 November 2012 }}</ref>

On 3 November 2008, [[Ruud Jolie]] stated on his blog, that the members of Within Temptation were going to take a year off, writing that "After the Theater Tour, that will start next week, me and the rest of Within Temptation are gonna take a whole year off. For the last 7 years, we've been hopping from studio to tour bus to airplane to boat to studio again to tour bus to bicycle to airplane to an occasional swimming pool on the top of a hotel to tour bus again. We all really needed a break from the band..." From that tour, On 11 August 2009, on their official website, [[Sharon Den Adel|Sharon]] announced that an acoustic album would be released in late October/early November called ''[[An Acoustic Night at the Theatre]]''. It would include several acoustic songs from their tour in November 2008. On 30 October the album was released, the single was released with the album called ''[[Utopia (Within Temptation song)|Utopia]]''. The song is a duet between Sharon and [[Chris Jones (British singer)|Chris Jones]] and was released on 23 October.

In the meantime, the band continued work on their new studio album. In an interview with Metal Ways at Appelpop 2008, guitarist Robert Westerholt stated that the new album was "probably going to be kind of a concept, but it's so early still that nothing is really sure yet. But we're trying to look in that direction."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-ways.com/163/13/interview-within-temptation-interview-appelpop-tiel.html |title=Within Temptation – Interview @ Appelpop (Tiel) 13.09.2008 |publisher=Metal Ways |access-date=15 April 2010}}</ref>

On 18 November 2010, the band announced via their website that their new album, entitled "The Unforgiving" would be released in March 2011.{{update after|2011|03|31}} The concept of the album would be based on a comic book series, written by Steven O’Connell (BloodRayne & Dark 48), and illustrated by Romano Molenaar (Witchblade, Darkness and X-Men). Each song on "The Unforgiving" was written along Steven's narrative, with characters in the songs reflecting the protagonists of the comic.
On 26 July 2010, the band announced that they would be embarking on a European tour at the beginning of 2011 in support of their new release. However, on 26 November 2010, it was announced that due to Sharon's third pregnancy, the tour dates would be moved from early 2011 to fall 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.within-temptation.com/headlines/sharon-important-news/ |title=Sharon: Important news |publisher=Within Temptation |access-date=20 August 2011}}</ref>

On 14 March 2011, Sony BMG organized an online-listening session of the-upcoming-album on a Polish website that only people from Poland could access. However, every song was soon after leaked onto the Internet. Within Temptation tried to prevent the leak before the release date. Limited promotion CDs were sent strictly to journalists who had to come to a listening session. Later that month, the second short film entitled "Sinéad" was released without an accompanying music video. However, it is available on the special edition CD/DVD set of ''The Unforgiving'' along with the remaining short film "Triplets" and music video for "Shot in the Dark".

In early 2012, to continue promoting the album, the band started a [[South American]] tour, passing over Brazil, Chile, Argentina, Peru and Ecuador. Right after coming back to Europe, the band presented a semi-acoustic Dutch theater tour in March 2012, called [[Sanctuary (tour)|Sanctuary]], much like their previous live album ''[[An Acoustic Night at the Theatre]]'' in which they played many songs never played before like ''Say My Name'', ''The Last Dance'', ''Overcome'', ''Bittersweet'' and some that they don't play often like ''Restless'', ''Sounds Of Freedom'', ''The Swan Song'' and ''Our Farewell''. Most of them were played in acoustic version. On 8 May 2012 Sharon den Adel and Ruud Jolie appeared on [[De Wereld Draait Door|DWDD Recordings]] to perform an acoustic cover of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana's]] song [[Smells Like Teen Spirit]]. The band embarked on a second leg of festivals, headlining several of the biggest European 2012 Summer Festivals, such as [[Sonisphere Festival|Sonisphere]], [[Masters of Rock (festival)|Masters of Rock]], [[Rock Werchter]], [[Summer Breeze Open Air|Summerbreeze]] and [[Gods of Metal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.within-temptation.com/ontour/ |title=On tour |publisher=Within Temptation |access-date=16 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122043041/http://www.within-temptation.com/ontour/ |archive-date=22 November 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.within-temptation.com/tour-archive/ |title=Tour archive |publisher=Within Temptation |access-date=16 November 2012}}</ref> Later, the band officially announced a very special show called ''Elements''.

In the run up to the 15th anniversary of Within Temptation, the band was asked by Belgian [[radio station]] ''Q-Music'' to choose and perform an existing track in a "Within Temptation style" once a week during fifteen weeks during their special program ''Within Temptation Friday''.<ref name="within-temptation2">{{cite web|url=http://www.within-temptation.com/qcovers/ |title=Within Temptation |publisher=Within Temptation |access-date=13 October 2013}}</ref> The covers consist most part of [[pop music|pop]] songs in which the band transformed into a more [[symphonic rock|symphonic]] oriented form. Lead vocalist [[Sharon den Adel]] stated that:“Our approach was to really make the cover a new Within Temptation song. So not going the easy way by using only a piano or an acoustic guitar for example, but really trying to put all the elements of a Within Temptation track in this new version. It was quite a challenge because we had only one week to get it right, while recording an original Within Temptation song can sometimes takes up half a year! But this pressure also gave us an{{sic}} creative boost and it was very rewarding to get it done in time each week. Also, we learned a lot from the in-depth analysis we needed to make on these hits, written by others, in combination with implementing our own sound and style in each new cover. We are glad that we’ve taken up this challenge and are very proud of the result."<ref name="within-temptation1"/> They covered artists such as [[Imagine Dragons]], [[OneRepublic]], [[Lana Del Rey]], [[The Who]] among others.<ref name="within-temptation2"/> On  19 April 2013, 11 of the 15 covers made by the band were them released in a cover album entitled ''[[The Q-Music Sessions]]''.<ref name="blabbermouth.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=188112 |title=Within Temptation To Release Covers Album |publisher=Blabbermouth.net |date=29 March 2013 |access-date=13 November 2013}}</ref> On the same day, the band released the official music video of their cover of [[Titanium (song)|Titanium]].

The name of the band's sixth studio album, Hydra, refers to this great variation in the band's main sound, as Westerholt said: "'Hydra' is a perfect title for our new album because like the monster itself, the record represents the many different sides of our music.”<ref>{{cite web|author=WTofficial |url=http://www.within-temptation.com/headlines/pre-order-new-album-hydra-starts-today/ |title=Pre-order new album HYDRA starts today |publisher=Within Temptation |date=8 November 2013 |access-date=13 November 2013}}</ref> American [[magazine]] [[Aquarian Weekly]] considered the title highly appropriate and compared it to the band's diverse musical history, alleging that they were able to find the right balance between all the musical changes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theaquarian.com/2014/01/22/an-interview-with-within-temptation-the-art-of-balance/|title=An Interview with Within Temptation: The Art Of Balance &#124; The Aquarian|first=Bryan|last=Reesman|website=www.theaquarian.com}}</ref> and, during the [[Hydra World Tour|following tour]], the sextet was also referred to as "a band that defy stereotypes".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/within-temptation-amaranthe-take-over-terminal-5-nyc-10-10-14/|title=Within Temptation & Amaranthe take over Terminal 5, NYC 10-10-14 - Cryptic Rock|website=crypticrock.com|date=7 November 2014}}</ref>
