It may have been inspired by the real-life Venetian surname [[House of Loredan|Loredan]], itself from the toponym [[Loreo, Veneto]], which originated from its Latin name ''Lauretum'',<ref>https://www.comune.loreo.ro.it/cenni-storici/</ref> meaning laurel. It is a common name in Italy and Romania.<ref>https://www.behindthename.com/name/loredana</ref> There is a related version without the opening letter ''l'', [[Oredana]], because is wrongly perceveid as an article (''L'Oredana'') and thus removed.
