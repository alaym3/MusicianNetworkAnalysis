'''Cherry Glazerr''' is an American rock band from [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], United States, formed in 2013. The current lineup consists of guitarist and lead vocalist [[Clementine Creevy]], bassist Sami Perez and drummer Tabor Allen. The band's sound has transitioned from lo-fi and garage rock on their debut release ''Haxel Princess'' in 2014 to a more polished rock sound, with elements of grunge, punk and new wave on their subsequent releases ''[[Apocalipstick (album)|Apocalipstick]]'' and ''[[Stuffed & Ready]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.godisinthetvzine.co.uk/2017/01/23/cherry-glazerr-apocalipstick-secretly-canadian/|title=Cherry Glazerr: Apocalipstick|website=GodIsInTheTVZine|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref>

==History==
===Formation and early years (2012-2016)===
Cherry Glazerr originated as 'Clembutt': a solo project for then-15 year old vocalist and guitarist Clementine Creevy, who wrote, performed and uploaded a small catalogue of songs onto [[SoundCloud]] in 2012. The tracks were discovered by [[Burger Records]] co-founder Sean Bohrman, who released them as a tape titled ''Papa Cremp'' in 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/22775-cherry-glazerr-apocalipstick|title=Cherry Glazerr: Apocalipstick|website=Pitchfork|accessdate=20 January 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Creevy was joined by her high school friends Hannah Uribe and Sophia Muller, on drums and vocals respectively, and Sean Redman on bass. The band takes its name from NPR reporter Chery Glaser.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://www.laweekly.com/music/cherry-glazerr-high-school-rockers-4255599|title=Cherry Glazerr: High School Rockers|website=L.A.
