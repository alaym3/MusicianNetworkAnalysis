'''The Dubliners''' were an [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish folk]] band founded in [[Dublin]] in 1962 as '''The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group''', named after its founding member; they subsequently renamed themselves The Dubliners. The line-up saw many changes in personnel over their fifty-year career, but the group's success was centred on lead singers [[Luke Kelly]] and [[Ronnie Drew]]. The band garnered international success with their lively Irish folk songs, traditional street ballads and instrumentals.<ref>{{cite news|author=Smiling Seoige sisters |url=http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/music/dubliners-50year-musical-odyssey-2985040.html |title=Dubliners' 50-year musical odyssey – Music, Entertainment |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 1 December 2012|access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> The band were regulars on the folk scenes in both Dublin and London in the early 1960s, and were signed to the [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]] label in 1965 after backing from [[Dominic Behan]] who was paid by Major-Minor to work with the Dubliners and help them to build a better act fit for larger concert hall venues. The Dubliners worked with Behan regularly between 1965 and 1966; Behan wrote numerous songs for this act including the song [[McAlpine's Fusiliers]] created specifically to showcase Ronnie Drew's gravel voice. They went on to receive extensive airplay on [[Radio Caroline]] which was part owned by Phil Solomon CEO of Major Minor, and eventually appeared on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in 1967 with hits "[[Seven Drunken Nights]]" (which sold over 250,000 copies in the UK)<ref>{{cite web|author=Nick Guida |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/dubs_02.htm |title=The Dubliners 1967–1969: It's the Dubliners |publisher=Itsthedubliners.com |date=1 May 1969 |access-date=6 August 2014}}</ref> and "[[The Black Velvet Band]]". Often performing political songs considered controversial at the time, they drew criticism from some folk purists and Ireland's national broadcaster [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann|RTÉ]] had placed an unofficial ban on their music from 1967 to 1971. During this time the band's popularity began to spread across mainland Europe and they appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' in the United States. The group's success remained steady right through the 1970s and a number of collaborations with [[The Pogues]] in 1987 saw them enter the [[UK Singles Chart]] on another two occasions.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/11/arts/music/barney-mckenna-banjo-player-in-the-dubliners-dies-at-72.html | work=The New York Times | first=Dennis | last=Hevesi | title=Barney McKenna, Banjo Player in the Dubliners, Dies at 72 | date=11 April 2012}}</ref>

The Dubliners were instrumental in popularising Irish folk music in Europe, though they did not quite attain the popularity of [[The Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem]] in the United States. They influenced many generations of Irish bands, and their legacy can to this day be heard in the music of artists such as The Pogues, [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Flogging Molly]]. Much adored in their native country, covers of Irish ballads by Ronnie Drew and Luke Kelly tend to be regarded as definitive versions. One of the most influential Irish acts of the 20th century, they celebrated 50 years together in 2012, making them Ireland's longest surviving musical act.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slacker.com/station/St-Patricks-Day |title=St. Patricks Day Station on Slacker Personal Radio |publisher=Slacker.com |date=28 January 1928 |access-date=4 February 2013 |archive-date=10 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010101939/http://www.slacker.com/station/st-patricks-day |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/news/--Dubliners-Banjo-Barney-McKenna-dies-over-his-morning-cuppa---VIDEOS-146360025.html |title=Dubliners "Banjo" Barney McKenna dies over his morning cuppa – Videos &#124; Irish News |publisher=IrishCentral |date=6 April 2012 |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> Also in 2012, the [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]] bestowed them with a Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01bljzz |title=BBC Radio 2 – BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards, Radio 2 Folk Awards 2012 |publisher=BBC |date=8 February 2012 |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> The Dubliners announced their retirement in the autumn of 2012, after 50 years of performing, following the death of original member [[Barney McKenna]].<ref name="ReferenceC">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedubliners.org/retirement.html |title= The Dubliners: Retirement |publisher=Thedubliners.org |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> However, the surviving members of the group, continued touring under the name of "The Dublin Legends", and as of 2021, Sean Cannon is the only remaining member of the Dubliners in that group, following the retirement of Patsy Watchorn in 2014 and the death of Eamonn Campbell in 2017.

==Formation and history==
[[File:ODonoghue pub Dublin Ireland.jpg|thumb|O'Donoghue's Pub on Merrion Row, Dublin, where the group played regularly in the early 1960s.]]

===Origins===
The Dubliners, initially known as "The Ronnie Drew Ballad Group", formed in 1962 and made a name for themselves playing regularly in [[O'Donoghue's Pub]] in Dublin. The change of name came about because of [[Ronnie Drew]]'s unhappiness with it, together with the fact that [[Luke Kelly]] was reading ''[[Dubliners]]'' by [[James Joyce]] at the time.<ref name="Its">{{cite web|author=Nick Guida |url=http://itsthedubliners.com/dubs_01.htm |title=The Dubliners 1962–1966: It's the Dubliners |publisher=Itsthedubliners.com |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref> Founding members were Drew, Kelly, [[Ciarán Bourke]] and [[Barney McKenna]].<ref name="Thedubliners.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.thedubliners.org/history.html |title=The Story so far... The Dubliners' History |publisher=TheDubliners.org |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>

Drew, McKenna and Thomas Whelan had originally teamed up for a fundraising concert<ref>''The Dubliners Songbook'', Heathside Music/Wise Publications 1974, Introduction by Eric Winter p.4</ref> and then went on to work in a revue with the Irish comedian John Molloy at the [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in Dublin. They used to sing songs between acts.

Before joining the Dubliners full-time, Kelly had spent some time playing at English folk clubs such as the Jug o'Punch in Birmingham, run by the folk singer [[Ian Campbell (folk musician)|Ian Campbell]].

The group played at the [[Edinburgh Festival]] in 1963 and that led to them being featured on a [[BBC]] programme called Hootenanny. The extra exposure helped them to win a contract with Transatlantic Records, with whom they recorded their first album, called simply ''The Dubliners''. They also recorded their first single featuring ''[[Rocky Road to Dublin]]'' and ''[[The Wild Rover]]''.

===Members of the group===
Drew spent some time in Spain in his younger years where he learned to play [[Flamenco guitar]], and he accompanied his songs on a [[Classical guitar|Spanish guitar]].<ref name="Its"/> Drew left the band in 1974 to spend more time with his family, and was replaced by Jim McCann. He returned to The Dubliners five years later, but left the group again in 1995.<ref name="Its"/> Ronnie Drew died at St Vincent's Private Hospital in Dublin on 16 August 2008 after a long illness.<ref>CBC News, [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2008/08/16/drew-dubliners.html ''Dubliners singer Ronnie Drew dies''], 16 August 2008. Retrieved on 13 March 2010.</ref> Paddy Reilly took Drew's place in 1995. Some of Drew's most significant contributions to the band are the hit single "[[Seven Drunken Nights]]", his rendition of "[[Finnegan's Wake]]", and "[[McAlpine's Fusiliers]]".

Luke Kelly was more of a balladeer than Drew, and he played chords on the five-string [[banjo]]. Kelly sang many defining versions of traditional songs like "[[The Black Velvet Band]]", "[[Whiskey in the Jar]]", "Home Boys Home"; but also [[Phil Coulter]]'s "[[The Town I Loved So Well]]", [[Ewan MacColl]]'s "[[Dirty Old Town]]", "[[The Wild Rover]]", and "[[On Raglan Road|Raglan Road]]", written by the famous Irish poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]]. In 1980, Luke Kelly was diagnosed with a brain tumour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/ronnie-drew-lead-singer-of-the-dubliners-900669.html |title=Ronnie Drew: Lead singer of the Dubliners – Obituaries  |newspaper=The Independent |date=18 August 2008 |access-date=4 February 2013 |location=London}}</ref> Occasionally Kelly was too ill to sing though he was sometimes able to join the band for a few songs.

Ciarán Bourke was a singer, but he also played the guitar, and tin whistle. He sang many songs in Irish ("[[Peigín Leitir Móir|Peggy Lettermore]]", "Preab san Ól"). In 1974 he collapsed on stage after suffering a brain haemorrhage. A second haemorrhage left him paralysed on his left side.<ref>{{citation | author = Mary Hardy | title = The Dubliners Scrapbook | quote = The night of 5 April 1974 was little short of catastrophic.

===Later changes and tours===
[[File:TheDubliners2005.jpg|thumb|The Dubliners in 2005. L-R: [[Eamonn Campbell]], [[John Sheahan]], [[Barney McKenna]], [[Seán Cannon]], [[Patsy Watchorn]].]]
In 1996 Ronnie Drew quit the band, and [[Paddy Reilly]] came on to replace him. Reilly, a long-time friend of the group, toured with them before on several occasions; he was already a successful solo artist in Ireland, scoring hits with "[[The Fields of Athenry]]" and "[[The Town I Loved So Well]]".

In 2005, Paddy Reilly moved to the United States, and [[Patsy Watchorn]] joined the group. Watchorn made a name for himself with [[The Dublin City Ramblers]]; like Kelly, he accompanies his songs on the five-string banjo.

The band toured Europe every year. A planned tour of Denmark two weeks after the death of McKenna on 5 April 2012 went ahead as planned. From the first show in Copenhagen on 18 April onwards he was replaced by the Irish banjo player [[Gerry O'Connor (banjo player)|Gerry O'Connor]].
In the fall of 2012 the band announced their retirement, effective after their 50th anniversary shows at the end of the year. The Dubliners played their final shows at [[Vicar Street]] in Dublin on 28/29/30 December 2012, and made their final TV appearance in the UK on a pre-recorded New Year's Eve edition of ''[[Hootenanny (British TV series)|Jools Holland Annual Hootenanny]]'' on 31 December. Their last public appearance as the Dubliners was on 27 January 2013 in memory of Barney McKenna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thedubliners.org/tourdates/tour2013.html |title=Concerts 2013 |publisher=Thedubliners.org |date=30 January 2013 |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>

==Reunions==

===25th anniversary===
In 1987, The Dubliners celebrated their 25th anniversary. They recorded a double CD, produced by [[Eamonn Campbell]], long-time friend and guest musician. He introduced them to [[The Pogues]], and their collaboration resulted in a hit with "[[The Irish Rover]]". It reached number 8 in the UK singles charts and number 1 in Ireland. In 1990 their final hit single was "Jack's Heroes/Whiskey in the Jar", again with The Pogues, which reached number 63 in the UK and number 4 in Ireland. Campbell, who plays the guitar on stage, has been touring with the band ever since. [[Christy Moore]], [[Paddy Reilly]] and [[Jim McCann (musician)|Jim McCann]] also featured on the CD; Moore sings a tribute to Luke Kelly, and McCann sings the song "I Loved the Ground She Walked Upon", written by [[Phil Coulter]] and [[Ralph McTell]]. The following year, to coincide with Dublin's millennial celebrations, [[Raidió Teilifís Éireann]] produced an hour-long special on the band and the city's influence on their music, titled ''[[The Dubliner's Dublin]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.talkingelephant.co.uk/artists/artist.php?Artist_Ref=22738&Genre_id=all |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130421093916/http://www.talkingelephant.co.uk/artists/artist.php?Artist_Ref=22738&Genre_id=all |url-status=dead |archive-date=21 April 2013 |title=The Dubliners |publisher=Talking Elephant |access-date=4 February 2013 }}</ref>

===40th anniversary===
In 2003, they temporarily reunited with Ronnie Drew and Jim McCann, for their [[The Dubliners 40 Years Anniversary Tour|40th anniversary tour]]. They made a string of appearances on Irish television throughout this time, including a memorable appearance with Phil Coulter and George Murphy on RTÉ 1.

After the tour, Jim McCann was diagnosed with throat cancer and, though he fully recovered, his voice was severely damaged, and he was unable to sing since his illness. Despite this, he regularly acted as [[MC]] at folk gigs, notably at The Dubliners reunion shows, and at the 2006 'Legends of Irish Folk' shows (where he also played guitar in the finale).

[[File:Dubliners Luxembourg.jpg|thumb|350px|The Dubliners performing in Luxembourg, 11 October 2008]]

===50th anniversary===
In 2012 the band celebrated their 50th anniversary with an extensive year-long European tour and the release of a live DVD recorded live at [[Dublin]]'s [[Vicar Street]] featuring Chris Kavanagh from the Band "The Legend of [[Luke Kelly]]" as a special guest. The tour continued in the wake of the death of the final founding member [[Barney McKenna]], although the band announced that the final shows of the tour, to be held 28–30 December also at [[Vicar Street]] would be the band's final shows in which the band were joined by former band member [[Jim McCann (musician)|Jim McCann]].

==Success==
[[File:The Dubliners with President 2012.jpg|left|thumb|The Dubliners with president Higgins of Ireland in 2012. L-R: Gerry O'Connor, Eamonn Campbell, Sean Cannon, John Sheahan, President Michael Higgins and Paddy Reilly]]

The Dubliners became well known, not just in Ireland but also as pioneers for Irish folk in Europe and also (though less successful) in the United States. Their 1967 recordings of "[[Seven Drunken Nights]]" and "[[The Black Velvet Band]]" were released on the fledgling [[Major Minor Records|Major Minor]] label, and were heavily promoted on [[pirate radio]] station [[Radio Caroline]]. The result was that both records reached the top 20 in the UK singles chart. A third single, "Maids, When You're Young Never Wed an Old Man" reached number 43 in December 1967. It was their last UK hit single till they recorded with [[The Pogues]] in 1987.

In 1974, Ronnie Drew decided to quit the band, to spend more time with his family. He was replaced with [[Jim McCann (musician)|Jim McCann]]. Before joining the band McCann had a TV show in the early seventies called ''The McCann man''. He is best known for his incarnations of "[[Carrickfergus (song)|Carrickfergus]]", [[Tommy Makem|Makem's]] "[[Four Green Fields]]", and "[[Lord of the Dance (hymn)|Lord of the Dance]]". He stayed with the band until 1979 when he left to start a solo career; then Ronnie Drew rejoined the band. First Ronnie went to Norway to record two songs in the Norwegian language with the Norwegian band Bergeners.

The Dubliners also gained popularity amongst famous musicians such as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Roy Orbison]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and Pink Floyd's drummer [[Nick Mason]], who were all self-proclaimed Dubliners fans.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/the-dubliners-legends-in-their-own-happy-hour-500749.html |title=The Dubliners: Legends in their own happy hour |publisher=Independent.ie |date= 24 November 2012|access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref>

In the 1960s, The Dubliners sang rebel songs such as "The Old Alarm Clock", "[[Foggy Dew (Irish ballad)|The Foggy Dew]]" and "Off to Dublin in the Green". However, the [[The Troubles|conflict]] in Northern Ireland from 1969 onwards led them to drop most of these from their repertoire. They resumed performing such songs occasionally towards the end of their career.  They have also recorded satirical protest songs against nuclear weapons such as ''The Button Pusher'' and ''Protect and Survive'', feminist songs such as ''[[Don't Get Married]]'', and socialist songs such as ''[[I Dreamed I Saw Joe Hill Last Night|Joe Hill]]''.

On 8 February 2012, The Dubliners received a "Lifetime Achievement Award" at the 2012 [[BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards]].
