==History==
Boston Manor started in Blackpool, Lancashire, England, in March 2013, after splitting up with their previous bands. “There isn’t much of a music scene in Blackpool,” vocalist Henry Cox affirmed. “We had a little stab at reinvigorating it. When we were 16, 17, 18, we were playing shows when we were with different bands. But there would be a gig at a venue and you could only do the one.” Talking about their beginnings, he added: “We had to buy a van and play outside Blackpool as it was the only way to get our music out there.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk/whats-on/music/dream-deal-for-resort-band-1-7496813|title=Dream deal for resort band|website=www.blackpoolgazette.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref> The band's name comes from the title of a demo that one of Henry's friends sent him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.snoozecontrol.be/interviews/6325/|title=Interview met Boston Manor [ENG]|last=Bert|first=Michael|website=Snoozecontrol.be|language=en|access-date=2019-08-28}}</ref>
