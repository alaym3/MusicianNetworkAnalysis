'''Iwrestledabearonce''' (often stylized in all lowercase) was an American <!-- see WP:LEAD: this is for a generalization of styles for the band and is not meant to be their primary genre -->[[metalcore]] band formed in 2007 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. In their nine years together, they released one [[Extended play|EP]], four full-length albums, and two remixed releases.

==History==

===Formation, EP and ''It's All Happening'' (2008—2010)===
Prior to Iwrestledabearonce, guitarist Steven Bradley played in the Louisiana mathcore band Statuescrybleeding, the band was active around 2004 and broke up sometime in 2006. Bradley met Krysta Cameron at which point, decided to start rehearsing music with her and some other musicians in the area when he was impressed with her growl vocals. Iwrestledabearonce was officially formed during 2007 in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. The origin of this band's name was inspired by a comment made by [[Gary Busey]] on [[Comedy Central]].<ref>[http://thrashocore.com/v4/cadres/index.php?url_defaut=http://www.thrashocore.com/v4/interviews/interview.php?interview_id=220___vo=1 Iwrestledabearonce pour la sortie de leur premier EP 9 (iwrestledabearonce interview)]{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} thrashocore.com.

Retrieved on 2010-03-05.</ref> They released their [[Iwrestledabearonce EP|debut EP]] in 2007 through Bucket of Truth Recordings, and later re-released it with new cover art through [[Tragic Hero Records]]. The release gained the band a small [[cult following]] due to their highly experimental musical style. It also granted the band enough attention to acquire drummer, Ryan Pearson. Due to the band lacking a drummer during the EP's recording, all percussion was done in a [[drum machine]] program.<ref>{{cite web|title=Iwresltedabearonce - It's All Happening [Album] {{!}} Altsounds.com Reviews|url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/108700-iwrestledabearonce-happening-album.html|publisher=Altsounds|access-date=January 3, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095150/http://hangout.altsounds.com/reviews/108700-iwrestledabearonce-happening-album.html|archive-date=February 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

===''Ruining It for Everybody'' and Cameron's departure (2011—2012)===
With the recording of the band's new album, which was revealed to be titled ''[[Ruining It for Everybody]]'', guitarist Steven Bradley stated that the group's new album will embrace [[black metal]], along with the band incorporating the use of [[corpse paint]]. He expressed that the entire band agreed that they do not want to be pigeonholed as a band that is suffixed as "core" any longer and the new record will be "90% black metal".<ref name="black metal">{{cite web|title=IWRESTLEDABEARONCE go black metal|url=http://thephoenix.com/BLOGS/onthedownload/archive/2011/05/17/iwrestledabearonce-goes-black-metal.aspx|work=The Phoenix|publisher=[[The Boston Phoenix]]|access-date=May 17, 2011}}</ref> Bradley went on to say “We were sick of getting lumped in with ‘scene’ and ‘whatever-core’ bands, so we decided to embrace our roots and just go straight black metal on the new album. We had to change our image to match ...because of course that's just as important, if not more so, than the music.” The black metal musical shift was later confirmed to be a large [[practical joke]] orchestrated by the band and the heavy metal website [[MetalSucks]]. The band's upcoming album, ''Ruining It for Everybody'' had a song from the album premiered on the website with the staff confirming that it was all a prank and that the upcoming album "features no actual black metal".<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Axl |url=http://www.metalsucks.net/2011/05/19/exclusive-track-premiere-iwrestledabearonce-are-ruining-it-for-everybody-show-us-their-karate-nipples/ |title=Exclusive Track Premiere: Iwrestledabearonce Are Ruining It For Everybody, Show Us Their "Karate Nipples" |publisher=MetalSucks |access-date=November 17, 2012}}</ref> The group primarily executed the joke to reveal and parody the over-serious attitude in black metal fans.

After the prank was revealed as false, Bradley later, in a serious note, commented on the album's style stating that it is "It's heavier, catchier, and better organized than anything we've done so far. We took a really spastic blend of genres and made it more cohesive."<ref name="Century profile"/>

During [[Warped Tour 2012]], it was announced that original vocalist Krysta Cameron was  [[pregnancy|pregnant]] and would have to leave the band for the rest of the tour. She was replaced by Courtney LaPlante, former vocalist of Unicron,<ref name="altpress.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/features/entry/i_want_people_to_hear_my_take_on_the_band_courtney_laplante_on_iwrestledabe|title="I want people to hear my take on the band:" Courtney LaPlante on Iwrestledabearonce's new album - Features - Alternative Press|website=Alternative Press|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> for the remainder of the tour.<ref name="altpress.com"/> However, bassist Mike "Ricky" Martin stated that same summer that Cameron would be permanently replaced by LaPlante after Cameron announced she would not be returning to the band due to wanting to spend more time with her family.

===''Late for Nothing'' (2013—2014)===
As of January 24, 2013, the band had been writing music for their third studio album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theprp.com/2013/01/24/news/iwrestledabearonce-writing-new-album/ |title=Iwrestledabearonce Writing New Album &#124; Theprp.com – Metal, Hardcore And Rock News, Reviews And More |publisher=Theprp.com |date=January 24, 2013 |access-date=August 6, 2013}}</ref>
On May 25, 2013, it was announced on their [[Facebook]] page that the band has finished recording the new album, following up with an update on June 7, 2013 that the album would be titled ''[[Late For Nothing]]'', and would be released on August 6, 2013. On June 11, 2013, they released the first song off the album entitled "Thunder Chunky". On June 25, 2013, [[Century Media Records|Century Media]] announced on their website that "Firebees" would be released as a single, along with an [[iTunes]] pre-order of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/newsdetailed.aspx?IdNews=13024&IdCompany=2 |title=IWRESTLEDABEARONCE: ANNOUNCE NEW SINGLE & ALBUM PRE-ORDER; CENTURY MEDIA RECORDS |publisher=centurymedia.com |date=June 25, 2013 |access-date=August 8, 2013}}</ref>
''Late for Nothing'' was released on August 6, 2013, along with an accompanied music video for the song "Boat Paddle". [[Steve Vai]] is noted to have provided sections of the song "Carnage Asada" on guitar.

Following uncertainty of the band's status along with LaPlante's and Stringer's position in Iwrestledabearonce following the unveiling of their new project, LaPlante confirmed during an Instagram live video session via her private account that she was no longer a member of Iwrestledabearonce, and also didn't know if the band would continue on.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/75623/news-courtney-laplante-confirms-her-departure-from-iwrestledabearonce|title=NEWS: Courtney LaPlante confirms her departure from iwrestledabearonce!|access-date=October 31, 2017}}</ref> In an interview with Loudwire in July 2019, she explained that her and her husband Mike Stringer's leaving was due to them being worn down by their status as "replacement people" (referring to how neither of them were original members), and their desire not to stagnate and to do something different.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/courtney-laplante-spiritbox-interview-iwrestledabearonce/|title=Spiritbox (ex-Iwrestledabearonce) Is Where Serene Art-Rock + Metal Savagery Meet|access-date=August 7, 2019}}</ref>
