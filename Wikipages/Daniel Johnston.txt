Beyond music, Johnston was accomplished as a visual artist, with his illustrations exhibited at various galleries around the world.

==Early life==
Johnston was born in [[Sacramento, California]], and grew up in [[New Cumberland, West Virginia]].<ref name="RSOBIT">{{cite web |last1=Grow |first1=Kory |title=Daniel Johnston, Cult Singer-Songwriter, Dead at 58 |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/daniel-johnston-dead-at-58/ |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=September 11, 2019|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref> He was the youngest of five children of William Dale "Bill" Johnston (1922–2017) and Mabel Ruth Voyles Johnston (1923–2010). He began recording music in the late 1970s on a $59 [[Sanyo]] monaural [[boombox]], singing and playing piano as well as the [[chord organ]].<ref name="RSOBIT" /> Following graduation from [[Oak Glen High School]], Johnston spent a few weeks at [[Abilene Christian University]] in [[West Texas]] before dropping out. He later attended the art program at [[Kent State University at East Liverpool|Kent State University, East Liverpool]], during which he recorded ''[[Songs of Pain]]'' and ''[[More Songs of Pain]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hihowareyou.com/web/bio.htm|title=Hi, How Are You? Daniel Johnston – Biography|website=www.hihowareyou.com}}</ref>

==Career==
===1980s–1990s===
When Johnston moved to [[Austin, Texas]], he began to attract the attention of the local press and gained a following augmented in numbers by his habit of handing out tapes to people he met.<ref>{{cite news |title=Daniel Johnson, cult singer-songwriter, dies age 58 |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/entertainment/news/article.cfm?c_id=1501119&objectid=12267070 |access-date=September 12, 2019 |newspaper=[[New Zealand Herald]] |date=September 12, 2019}}</ref> Live performances were well-attended and hotly anticipated.<ref>{{cite news|last=Black |first=Louis |url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/story?oid=oid:363536 |title=Genius and Jive: My roller-coaster relationship with Daniel Johnston Austin Screens |newspaper=[[Austin Chronicle]]|publisher=Austin Chronicle Corp.|location=Austin, Texas |date=May 5, 2006|access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref> His local standing led to him being featured in a 1985 episode of the [[MTV]] program ''[[I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge|The Cutting Edge]]'' featuring performers from Austin's "[[New Sincerity]]" music scene.<ref>{{cite book|first=Barry|last=Shank|title=Dissonant Identities: The Rock'N'Roll Scene in Austin, Texas|publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]]|location=Middleton, Connecticut|date=1994|isbn=978-0-8195-6276-0|pages=157–58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v79of-KXnfgC&q=%22The+Cutting+Edge%22&pg=PA157|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

In 1988, Johnston visited [[New York City]] and recorded ''[[1990 (Daniel Johnston album)|1990]]'' with producer [[Mark Kramer]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kramershimmy.com |title=kramershimmy home |publisher=Kramershimmy.com |access-date=September 18, 2010}}</ref> at his Noise New York studio.<ref name="RSOBIT" /> This was Johnston's first experience in a professional recording environment after a decade of releasing home-made cassette recordings. His mental health further deteriorated during the making of ''1990''.<ref name="PFOBIT">{{cite web |last1=Blais-Billie |first1=Braudie |title=Daniel Johnston Dead at 58 |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/daniel-johnston-dead-at-58/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=September 11, 2019|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref> In 1989, Johnston released the album ''[[It's Spooky]]'' in collaboration with singer [[Jad Fair]] of the band [[Half Japanese]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Schreiber |first1=Ryan |title=It's Spooky review |url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/2957-its-spooky/ |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=June 19, 2001|access-date=September 11, 2019}}</ref>

In 1990, Johnston played at a music festival in Austin, Texas. On the way back to West Virginia on a private two-seater plane piloted by his father Bill, Johnston had a [[mania|manic]] psychotic episode; believing he was [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]], Johnston removed the key from the plane's ignition and threw it outside. His father, a former U.S. Air Force pilot, managed to successfully crash-land the plane, even though "there was nothing down there but trees". Although the plane was destroyed, Johnston and his father emerged with only minor injuries. As a result of this episode, Johnston was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/apr/02/metallica | work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]| location=London, England | title=Sean O'Hagan on Daniel Johnston | first=Sean | last=O'Hagan | date=April 2, 2006 | access-date=March 15, 2011}}</ref>

Interest in Johnston increased when [[Kurt Cobain]] was frequently photographed wearing a T-shirt featuring the cover image of Johnston's album ''[[Hi, How Are You]]'' that music journalist [[Everett True]] had given to him.<ref name="RSOBIT" /> Cobain listed ''[[Yip/Jump Music]]'' as one of his favorite albums in his journal, in 1993.<ref name="joyfulnoiserecordings.com">{{cite web|title=Top 50 by Nirvana [MIXTAPE] |url=http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |access-date=May 8, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018034220/http://www.joyfulnoiserecordings.com/journal/top-50-by-nirvana/ |archive-date=October 18, 2014 }}</ref>
In spite of Johnston being resident in a [[mental hospital]] at the time, there was a bidding war to sign him. He refused to sign a multi-album deal with [[Elektra Records]] because [[Metallica]] was on the label's roster and he was convinced that they were [[Satan]]ic and would hurt him,<ref name="PFOBIT" /> also dropping his longtime manager, Jeff Tartakov, in the process.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/0811johnston0811.html | work=[[The Arizona Republic]] |publisher=[[Gannett]]| location=Phoenix, Arizona| title=The Devil and Daniel Johnston | first=Michael | last=Senft | date=August 11, 2006 | access-date=March 15, 2011}}</ref> Ultimately he signed with [[Atlantic Records]] in February 1994 and that September released ''[[Fun (Daniel Johnston album)|Fun]]'', produced by [[Paul Leary]] of [[Butthole Surfers]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2005/aug/20/edinburghfilmfestival2005.popandrock | work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]| location=London, England | title=Personal demons | first=John | last=Robinson | date=August 20, 2005 | access-date=April 30, 2010}}</ref> It was a commercial failure.

[[File:Hi How Are You Austin 2005.jpg|thumb|200px|Johnston's "Hi, How Are You" mural in [[Austin, Texas]].|alt=an outline cartoon drawing of a smiling frog with eye stalks reminiscent of a snail]]

In 1993, the Sound Exchange record store in Austin, Texas, commissioned Johnston to paint a [[mural]] of the ''Hi, How Are You?'' frog (also known as "Jeremiah the Innocent") from the album's cover.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rejectedunknown.com/art/public/bajafresh.htm |title=Baja Fresh Hi How Are You frog mural |website=Rejectedunknown.com |date=January 6, 2004 |access-date=July 9, 2012}}</ref> After the record store closed in 2003, the building remained unoccupied until 2004 when the Mexican grill franchise [[Baja Fresh]] took ownership and decided that they would remove the wall that held the mural.

In 2006, Jeff Feuerzeig released a documentary about Johnston, ''[[The Devil and Daniel Johnston]]''; the film, four years in the making, collated some of the vast amount of recorded material Johnston (and in some case, others) had produced over the years to portray his life and music.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Itzkoff |first1=Dave |author-link=Dave Itzkoff|title=Daniel, You're a Star: SPIN's 2006 Interview With Daniel Johnston's Documentarian |url=https://www.spin.com/2019/09/daniel-johnston-documentary-interview/ |website=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |publisher=[[SpinMedia]]|location=San Francisco, California|date=September 11, 2019|access-date=September 12, 2019}}</ref> The film won high praise, receiving the Director's Award at the 2005 [[Sundance Film Festival]].<ref name="GUOBIT">{{cite news |last1=Beaumont-Thomas |first1=Ben |title=Daniel Johnston, cult US indie songwriter, dies aged 58 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2019/sep/11/daniel-johnston-cult-us-indie-songwriter-dies-aged-58 |access-date=September 12, 2019 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=September 11, 2019}}</ref> The film also inspired more interest in Johnston's work, and increased his prestige as a touring artist.
