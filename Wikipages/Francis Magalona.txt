'''Francis Michael Durango Magalona''' (October 4, 1964 – March 6, 2009), also known by the moniker '''Francis M''', was a Filipino rapper, singer, songwriter, entrepreneur, actor, and television personality. He is widely regarded as the best and the most successful local Filipino rapper of all-time. Born in [[Manila]], he is often credited as the pioneer of [[Pinoy hip-hop]] as he was the first Filipino rapper in the Philippines to cross over into the mainstream. He became a significant influence to artists in the Pinoy hip-hop scene and the local rap community.

Beyond music, Magalona was also a television host on [[MTV Asia]] and [[Channel V Philippines]] and on the noontime variety television show ''[[Eat Bulaga!]]''. Magalona died on March 6, 2009, seven months after being diagnosed with [[acute myelogenous leukemia]].<ref name=pdiobt>{{cite news |title=FrancisM loses 'happy battle'; 44 |author=Pocholo Concepcion |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090307-192805/FrancisM-loses-happy-battle-44 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=March 7, 2009 |access-date=March 7, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309232900/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/entertainment/entertainment/view/20090307-192805/FrancisM-loses-happy-battle-44 |archive-date=March 9, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Magalona was later awarded a posthumous [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Philippines|Presidential Medal of Merit]].

==Family and early career==
Magalona was the eighth of the nine children of actors [[Pancho Magalona]] and [[Tita Duran]], popular film stars of the 1940s and 1950s.<ref name=pdiobt/> His grandfather, [[Enrique B. Magalona]], was a politician and served as a Senator of the Philippines from 1946 to 1949 and from 1949 to 1955. He graduated from high school at the [[Don Bosco Technical College]] in [[Mandaluyong]] from 1978 to 1981 and studied at the [[San Beda College]] in Manila from 1981 to 1984.

Magalona started out as a [[breakdancer]] in the 1980s.<ref name=pdiobt/> He was cast in several Filipino movies including ''[[Bagets 2]]''. He was the resident DJ/rapper in the [[IBC-13]] variety show ''Loveli'Ness''.<ref name=pdiobt/>

Magalona was introduced by co-actor [[Richard Gomez]] to Pia Arroyo at a party in a disco owned by film director [[Ishmael Bernal]],<ref>{{cite press release |title=Francis Magalona, Filipino People's Artist, 44 | publisher = The Alliance-Philippines (AJLPP) | date = March 9, 2009 | url = http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/03/09/18575709.php | access-date = March 10, 2009}}</ref> and the couple got married in 1985.<ref name="magalona2001">{{cite web |last = Magalona |first = Francis |title = The Magalonas of Antipolo |publisher = Genealogy.com |date = December 24, 2001 |url = http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/m/a/g/Francis-Magalona/index.html |access-date = March 10, 2009 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090311072638/http://www.genealogy.com/genealogy/users/m/a/g/Francis-Magalona/index.html |archive-date = March 11, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}</ref> The couple had eight children, two of whom were Magalona's stepchildren:<ref>{{cite news |author=Philippine Entertainment Portal |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/52217/PEP-list-Hot-male-celebrities-in-their-40s |title=PEP list: Hot male celebrities in their 40s |access-date=March 9, 2009 |publisher=GMA News |date=July 23, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Erika Tapalla |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20090308-193024/Magalona-kids-find-strength-in-each-other |title=Magalona kids find strength in each other |access-date=March 9, 2009 |publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |date=March 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311000418/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20090308-193024/Magalona-kids-find-strength-in-each-other |archive-date=March 11, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Unna, Nicolo, and television personalities [[Maxene Magalona|Maxene (Max)]] (1986), [[Frank Magalona|Francis Jr.]] (Frank) (1987), [[Saab Magalona|Saab]] (1988), [[Elmo Magalona|Elmo]] (1994), Arkin and Clara Magalona, who entered showbiz to follow their father's footsteps.

==Music career==

===Filipino hip hop and nationalistic rap===
In 1990, he released the album ''Yo!'', the first commercially released Filipino rap album.<ref name=mt>{{cite news |title=Francis M. dies of leukemia, 44 |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/march/07/yehey/top_stories/20090307top7.html |publisher=Manila Times |date=March 7, 2009 |access-date=March 8, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310010724/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2009/march/07/yehey/top_stories/20090307top7.html |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> ''Yo!'' included several popular singles such as "[[Mga Kababayan]]" (Fellow Countrymen), "Gotta Let 'Cha Know", "Cold Summer Nights", and a duet with Pia Arroyo "Loving You" as the only song that Pia recorded.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} With tracks that featured politically conscious and thought-provoking rhymes in both English and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], ''Yo!'' was a big success and helped catapult [[Filipino hip hop]] from underground to mainstream status. It also marked the birth of Makabayang (nationalistic) rap in Filipino hip hop.

In 1992, Francis Magalona released ''Rap Is FrancisM'' (1992). With tracks addressing the various cultural and social problems that plagued his country such as drug addiction in "Mga Praning" (Paranoids), political instability in "Halalan" (Elections) as well as the detrimental effects of a [[colonial mentality]] in "Tayo'y Mga Pinoy" (We Are Filipinos), the record's complexity and conscious message quickly earned it its classic status and became the standard by which future albums of the genre were to be compared{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. This album helped tag Magalona as one of the most politically conscious voices of his generation.<ref name=msnbc>{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29543350/ |title=King of Philippine rap, Francis Magalona, dies |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=March 6, 2009 |access-date=March 8, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=November 2019|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===Hardware Syndrome and the merging of rap with Pinoy rock===
The release of his third album, ''[[Meron akong ano!]]'' (I Got Something!) in 1993 marked the beginning of Magalona's experimentation with [[Pinoy rock]].<ref name=pdiobt/> It also saw the birth of Hardware Syndrome—previously known as Cannabis—the band that would, with Magalona at its helm, introduce the merging of Pinoy rock and rap to the Filipino music audience. Members over the years included musicians Carlo Sison, Francis Villanueva, Niño Mesina, Boyet Aquino, Elmer Blancaflor, Noel Mendez, [[Perf de Castro]], Benjie "Bagets" Mendez, Albert Tamayo, DJ Kimozave, DJ Radikal MK, Kenji Marquez, Jack Rufo, and [[Pupil (band)#Wendell Garcia|Wendell Garcia]].<ref name="hardwaresyndrome">{{cite web | last = Magalona | first = Francis | title = The Hardware Syndrome | work = A Free Mind | date = March 3, 2006 | url = http://francismagalona.multiply.com/journal/item/93/The_Hardware_Syndrome | access-date = March 9, 2009 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090328061940/http://francismagalona.multiply.com/journal/item/93/The_Hardware_Syndrome | archive-date = March 28, 2009 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Magalona was soon cited for excellence in both genres of music. He collaborated with other notable [[Original Pilipino Music|OPM]] artists including [[Andrew E.]], [[Joey Ayala]], Heber Bartolome of Banyuhay, [[Ryan Cayabyab]], Mike Hanopol of [[Juan Dela Cruz Band]], [[Michael V.]], [[Death Threat (hip hop musician)|Death Threat]], and the band [[Eraserheads]]. In the latter part of his career, Magalona worked together with rappers Pikaso, [[Gloc 9]] and the Pinoy rock band [[Parokya ni Edgar]]. In 1994, Magalona moved from [[PolyEast Records|Octo-Arts EMI Philippines]], which had released all of his previous albums, to [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc.]] with [[BMG Records|Musiko Records]] (is a wholly owned of sub-labels of a [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc.]]), the same label as the seminal Pinoy rock group, The Eraserheads.<ref name="hardwaresyndrome"/>

''[[Freeman (Francis Magalona)|Freeman]]'' was released the following year, 1995, and firmly established Magalona's legitimacy in the Pinoy rock scene. Tracks such as "Three Stars & A Sun", "Kabataan Para Sa Kinabukasan" (Children For The Future), "[[Kaleidoscope World (Francis Magalona song)|Suckin' on Helium/Kaleidoscope World]]" would become defining touchpoints in Magalona's body of work. A track titled "Intellectual Property Rights" would sample a speech by then-president [[Fidel V. Ramos]]. [[Intellectual property rights]] was an issue that would continue to be an important and very personal advocacy for Magalona.<ref name="hardwaresyndrome"/><ref>{{cite AV media notes| title = Freeman | others = Francis Magalona| date = 1995| type = CD Inlay Card| publisher = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc.]], [[Bertelsmann Music Group|Musiko Records]]}}</ref> "[[Kaleidoscope World (Francis Magalona song)|Kaleidoscope World]]" went on to win [[Awit Awards|1996 Awit Award]] for Best Produced Record of the Year, and the [[NU Rock Awards|1996 NU 107 Rock Award]] for Song of the Year.

Magalona's next album, ''[[Happy Battle]]'', was released in 1996.<ref>{{cite AV media notes| title =Happy Battle |others =Francis Magalona | date =1996| type = CD Inlay Card | publisher = [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc.]], [[BMG Records|Musiko Records]]}}</ref> The launch for the video-game themed album at the [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[Makati]] was noted by the press for its wide range of influences: aside from fans of Magalona's music, he had showbiz fans and coworkers from [[Eat Bulaga!]], where he had already started hosting; and two sets of Sony PlayStations with giant screens set up so people could play video games while watching the gig. The album was also notable for a number of significant collaborations: "Unstrung Heroes" with [[Ely Buendia]]; "Sapot" (Web) with project band ''Planet Garapata'', which included [[Raimund Marasigan]], Jeng Tan, and Mark Lakay, who would later form [[Sandwich (band)|Sandwich]]; and "Make Your Move" with pioneer Filipino punk band Betrayed. In keeping with the nationalistic theme in Magalona's work, 1-800-Ninety-Six was written in celebration of the centennial of the [[Philippine revolution|Philippine revolution of 1896]]. "Rainy" won ''Best Folk song'', and the album itself would become the only album to win ''Best Rock'' and ''Best Rap Album'' at the Katha Awards.<ref name="hardwaresyndrome"/> When Magalona was diagnosed with leukemia, he and his wife Pia would use the album name "Happy Battle" as a reference to his fight against cancer.<ref name=pdiobt/>

===Later albums with Sony Music===
The 1998 album ''The Oddventures of Mr. Cool'' saw a move from the last two albums' heavy guitar sound and explored mellow, urban-style rapping. It featured the song "Whole Lotta Lovin'", whose music is a sample of the ''Eraserheads'' song "Alapaap" (Heaven).

Later albums with BMG (now with [[Sony Music]]) would include ''Interscholastic'' (1999), which featured adaptations of various artists' songs; and ''Freeman 2'' (2001), which would echo many of the themes that had made the first ''Freeman'' album so popular. In 2002, his greatest hits album ''The Best of FrancisM'' was released by [[BMG Records|Musiko Records]] and [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG Records (Pilipinas) Inc.]] 2004 in turn saw the release of a single titled "Pambihira Ka" (You're Remarkable).

===Independent projects===
In 2002, with the assistance of then FUBU Philippines' management employees Carlo Maniquiz and Nick Tuason, Magalona launched a compilation album of the same name.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/oct/09/yehey/enter/20041009ent1.html |title=Urban Noypis (Part 2) |work=ManilaTimes.net |date=October 9, 2004 |first=Cris O |last=Ramos |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050116144726/http://www.manilatimes.net/national/2004/oct/09/yehey/enter/20041009ent1.html |archive-date=January 16, 2005}}</ref>

Magalona founded his own record company called Red Egg Records, and a production company, Filipino Pictures Inc., where he served as the resident director. Through his production company, Magalona produced and directed music videos for several bands and solo artists such as Ely Buendia. His work on [[Sponge Cola]]'s "KLSP" won Best Rock Video at the 2006 [[MYX]] Video Awards.

Shortly before his death, Magalona collaborated with Ely Buendia and other Filipino artists on an album with the working title ''The Sickos Project'', which was later named as "In Love and War", and released posthumously.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/151690/Eat-Bulaga-to-pay-tribute-to-Francis-M-Saturday|title= Eat Bulaga! to pay tribute to Francis M Saturday|date=March 6, 2009|publisher=GMANews.TV|access-date=March 7, 2009}}</ref> Both Francis M. and Ely Buendia were having health problems at that time. The album's carrier single is "Higante" (Giant), which is about illness and strengths. Its music video was released in September 2009.

In an interview, Ely Buendia described himself as a "ticking timebomb" and Francis Magalona as "on borrowed time." The album will include a documentary about Ely and Francis, shot by Magalona's very own production company Filipino Pictures.

==Television career==
In addition to co-hosting ''LoveliNess'', Magalona was one of the original members of the youth oriented show ''[[That's Entertainment (Philippine TV program)|That's Entertainment]]'' in 1987. He was also a co-host of the Philippine noontime variety show [[Eat Bulaga!]] as well as being a VJ for [[MTV Asia]] and [[Channel V]].<ref name=msnbc/> He was MTV Asia's first [[Philippines|Filipino]] VJ and remained with the network from 1996 to 2000.

He was also known for starring in the second installment of ''[[Bagets]]''. In 1997, Magalona played the lead role in the made-for-TV movie ''Kamada'' by Raymond Red. The film, a full-length feature shot on 16&nbsp;mm, received awards from The Philippines Broadcasting Television and Asian TV Awards during the same year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.raymondred.com/About_RaymondRed.html |title=Raymond Red |access-date=March 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409063613/http://www.raymondred.com/About_RaymondRed.html |archive-date=April 9, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

He was also chosen by [[Fremantle Media]], owners of ''[[American Idol]]'' as one of the judges of in the first ''[[Philippine Idol]]'' season that aired on [[Associated Broadcasting Company|ABC (now TV5)]]. Magalona and his fellow judges [[Ryan Cayabyab]] and [[Pilita Corrales]] were not retained when the franchise transferred to [[GMA Network]] in 2008 with a different title: ''[[Pinoy Idol]]''. Aside from television, he also hosted live events and presentations.

==Other endeavors==
[[Image:FrancisM Pride.JPG|thumb|upright|Magalona wearing clothing his company had designed.]]
Magalona was a photographer and submitted pictures to magazines for publication. News reports note that he was overjoyed when he was accepted as a member of the Camera Club of the Philippines, and eventually received critical acclaim for his photographs.<ref name=pdiobt/>

Magalona also established a clothing line named FMCC, which stood for "FrancisM Clothing Co." FMCC is sold in stores called "3 Stars & A Sun."

He also started a foundation with Ely Buendia called Heartist Foundation, which aims to help Filipino artists with health and commercial concerns.

==Illness and death==
Magalona was diagnosed with [[acute myeloid leukemia]] on August 8, 2008 at the Medical City Hospital, [[Pasig]]. Appealing to the media and the public, Magalona said: {{quote|I don't want a media circus, [...] I want privacy with my family. What I'd rather talk about is how we can solicit blood donations to replace the supply that I have consumed in the hospital.|Francis Magalona, August 2008<ref name="diagnosed">{{cite web |url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080813-154425/UPDATE-Francis-M-diagnosed-with-leukemia |title=Rapper Francis Magalona diagnosed with leukemia |author=Pocholo Concepcion |date=August 13, 2008 |access-date=March 6, 2009 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310192046/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20080813-154425/UPDATE-Francis-M-diagnosed-with-leukemia |archive-date=March 10, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>}}

After his first treatment and discharge, he made his return on ''Eat Bulaga'' together with [[Ely Buendia]], who had also been recently discharged. His daughter Maxene stated that "He always did what he wanted to do. He never let anyone or anything stop him from doing what he loved to do. He still went to the Camera Club, he still took pictures, every time he was discharged from the hospital, he recorded songs with Ely Buendia. He taught us that life is short but it can be well lived.

His wife, Pia, later described her husband's battle with the disease, saying "Francis was a very passionate person. When he was angry, he was very expressive. He would get angry with his cancer. That was his way of coping with it. But he didn't give up.

Numerous television programs, ranging from noontime variety shows to primetime newscasts and late night news documentaries, paid tribute to Magalona.

He had been slated to appear as a special surprise guest at the [[Eraserheads]]' "the Final Set" reunion concert on March 7, 2009. Since he died the day before, the band instead dedicated the concert to Magalona. Buendia rapped the 22-bar portion in "Superproxy" which Magalona wrote,<ref name="super-proximity">Magalona, F.

Magalona was cremated before daybreak on March 11, 2009. Hours later, his ashes were laid to rest at the Loyola Memorial Park in [[Marikina]], causing traffic to stall in the [[Riverbanks Center|Marikina Riverbanks]] area near the park as fans and numerous people from the entertainment industry joined the convoy. The Philippine Army rendered military honors to Magalona in recognition of his patriotism and service as a sergeant in the reserves. His widow, Pia, received the flag draped on his coffin.<ref name="Thea">{{Cite journal

===Post-death crisis===
The Magalona family was also firm against any attempts to capitalize on FrancisM's death and persona. On March 17, 2009, a group of Filipino expatriates in Dubai, UAE and Saudi Arabia, announced plans to hold tribute concerts where performers will sing his songs, with the proceeds supposedly going to a foundation set up in his honor and to the [[Philippine National Red Cross|Philippine Red Cross]]. Pia and Maxene later came out and denounced the organizers, saying that neither concert had the family's blessings and the foundation did not exist. They particularly admonished the concert organizers for using the Red Cross to attract attendees.<ref>{{cite web|first=Karen A. |last=Pagsolingan |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/21167/Pia-Magalona-says-%22tribute-concerts-for-Francis-M%22-in-Canada-and-Dubai-are-fake |title=Francis M "tribute concerts" in UAE and Dubai do not have his family's blessing |publisher=PEP.ph |date=March 17, 2009 |access-date=October 22, 2009}}</ref> Pia also asked the public not to patronize sellers of fake FMCC goods, which started to appear within days of Magalona's death. Their house had been broken into a number of times, the apparent main targets being Magalona's personal items, along with his children's belongings. One of the stolen items was a laptop computer on which unpublished FMCC designs were stored.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ruel J. |last=Mendoza |url=http://www.pep.ph/news/21634/Pia-Magalona-overwhelmed-that-Martin-Nievera-will-wear-t-shirt-designed-by-Francis-M-in-Pacquiao-Hatton-fight |title=Pia Magalona overwhelmed that Martin Nievera will wear t-shirt designed by Francis M in Pacquiao-Hatton fight |publisher=PEP.ph |date=May 2, 2009 |access-date=October 22, 2009}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Magalona would ultimately be cited not just the "King of Philippine Rap" but also "The Father of Pinoy Hip Hop".<ref name=msnbc/> Magalona's contributions to the genre have been featured in several international hip hop publications including the ''All Music Guide to Hip-Hop: The Definitive Guide to Rap and Hip-Hop'' (2003) published by Backbeat Books; as well as the May 2004 issue of the U.S.-based publication ''The Source''. He was also given the Pioneer Hall of Fame Award by Empire Entertainment at the 1st Annual Philippine Hip-Hop Music Awards in 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.titikpilipino.com/news/index.php?aid=397&offset=0&expanded= |title=1st Philippine Annual Hip-hop Music Awards |work=Titik Pilipino |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221092711/http://www.titikpilipino.com/news/index.php?aid=397&offset=0&expanded= |archive-date=February 21, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref>

Magalona was the recipient of the [[MTV Pilipinas Video Music Awards]] ''Generations Award'' in 2006 "in recognition of his career that has spanned decades and broken boundaries, and for his music which continues to inspire generations of artists and music fans both here and abroad." He was the second person so honored, the first having been singer [[Gary Valenciano]] at the 2005 rites.

On March 18, 2009, the Philippine Government – through the efforts of the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts (Philippines)|National Commission for Culture and the Arts]]<ref name="medal"/>—recognized Magalona with by awarding him a posthumous [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the Philippines|Presidential Medal of Merit]].  The award's citation noted that it had been given "''for his musical and artistic brilliance, his deep faith in the Filipino and his sense of national pride that continue to inspire us.''"<ref name="Guinto"/><ref name="Romero"/>

Several supporters of Magalona launched an [[online petition]] to award him, the Order of [[National Artist of the Philippines|National Artist]], which is the highest recognition for Philippine artists. However, nominations for the National Artist award will have to be done after three years as nominations for the order are closed.<ref name="NationalArtist">{{Cite news |title = Nomination National Artist|newspaper = ABS-CBN News|date = March 11, 2009|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/entertainment/03/11/09/francis-m-nomination-national-artist-stalled}}</ref> His daughter Maxene has indicated that she intends to continue Magalona's projects, including his ''The Sickos Project'' album with Buendia, and a documentary about his battle with cancer. The young actress stated: "We will coordinate with the people he had been working with, [...] I understand that Papa is a big part of history."<ref name="Maxenelegacy" />

Magalona was given a tribute during a segment at the [[2019 Southeast Asian Games opening ceremony]] at the [[Philippine Arena]], where three of his songs being rendered by his son [[Elmo Magalona]], who sang "Man From Manila", [[Iñigo Pascual]], who gave a rendition of "Mga Kababayan", and [[KZ Tandingan]], who sang "Tayo'y Mga Pinoy". The said segment in the ceremony showcased the energy of the Filipino people.
