==Early life and education==
Jamie T was born Jamie Alexander Treays in Wimbledon, South London on 8 January 1986

Jamie was educated at [[Hall School Wimbledon]], [[Reed's School]] and [[Esher College]].

Growing up, Jamie suffered from panic attacks,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theskinny.co.uk/article/38234-jamie-t-pacemaker|title=Jamie T – Pacemaker|publisher=[[The Skinny (magazine)|The Skinny]]}}</ref> hence the name of his debut album, "''[[Panic Prevention]]''".

==Career==
[[Zane Lowe]] made "Salvador" his single of the week and "Back in the Game" his Hottest Record in the World. On John Tweddle's show, "Back in the Game" featured as his "Pet Sound" and his single "Sheila" was [[Jo Whiley]]'s Record of the Week. "Sheila" was also [[playlist]]ed by [[BBC Radio 1]] thus receiving more airtime across all shows. Jamie's songs received a lot of airplay on [[Xfm London|XFM]] throughout 2006, especially "Sheila" and "[[If You Got the Money]]".

"Sheila" was released on 29 July 2006. Two videos were made for the song; the first video in 2006 consisted of monkeys living in a house and short clips of Jamie singing, while the second video in 2007 features actor [[Bob Hoskins]] walking along the [[River Thames]] [[lip synch]]ing to the lyrics. On 16 October 2006, Jamie released his [[anthem]]ic tune, "If You Got the Money" which reached No. 13 in the charts. His next single "[[Calm Down Dearest]]" was released in the UK on 15 January 2007 and reached No. 9, his first top 10 hit.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/25810 |title=This week's releases 15 January 2007 |publisher=[[NME]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003150113/http://www.nme.com/news/25810 |archive-date= 3 October 2007 }}</ref>

His debut album ''[[Panic Prevention]]'' was then released on 29 January 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/25149 |title=Jamie T completes debut album |publisher=[[NME]] }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> [[Lily Allen]] provided backing vocals on the song "Rawhide" the B-side to the re-release of "Sheila" on 7 May 2007.

==="Fire Fire" and "Sticks 'n' Stones" (2009)===
On 12 January 2009, a music video appeared on Jamie's website for a new song, "Fire Fire". The track has elements of Jamie's trademark sound but incorporates faster rhythms, a punk aesthetic and a more abrasive sound than previous singles. Jamie T has said to ''NME'' "'Fire Fire' won't be released as a single nor will it be on the new album, it is just a thank you for the fans being so patient." He did announce a date for his new single though, ''Sticks 'n' Stones'' EP, which was released on 29 June.

21 May 2009 saw the release of the official video for his single "[[Sticks 'n' Stones (Jamie T song)|Sticks 'n' Stones]]". In an email received by subscribers to his website, Jamie said, "Just a little note to say thanks to everyone who’s supporting Sticks ‘n’ Stones. We just finished shooting a little video for the track the other day, so fresh out the edit room it is here for your enjoyment. It was a lot of fun to make and we hope you like it. Hope to see you all soon... Thanks Jamie". The video was shot almost entirely in the London suburb of Wimbledon, his home town, and features scenes of himself and others, including fellow band members.

On 29 June 2009, Jamie released "Sticks 'n' Stones", the first single from his second album ''[[Kings and Queens (Jamie T album)|Kings and Queens]]'', as an extended play with three other tracks, "St. Christopher", "On the Green" and "The Dance of the Young Professionals". "Sticks 'n' Stones" reached No. 15 in the UK singles chart. The song also reached number 14 for 2009 songs on the annual [[Triple J Hottest 100]], one of the largest popularly voted countdowns in the world.

===''Chaka Demus'' EP (2009)===
Then on 31 August 2009, he released a further EP, the "[[Chaka Demus (Jamie T song)|Chaka Demus EP]]" which includes the second single taken from ''Kings & Queens'', also called "Chaka Demus". This too features three other songs; "Forget Me Not (The Love I Knew Before I Grew)", "Planning Spontaneity" and "When They Are Gone (For Tim)".

===''Kings and Queens''' (2009)===
A week later, on 7 September, second album ''[[Kings and Queens (Jamie T album)|Kings and Queens]]'' was released. This features 11 tracks (plus bonus track "The Curious Sound" featuring Ben Bones, when downloaded from iTunes). Jamie has said that his favourite song in this album is "Emily's Heart" because it reminds him of Emily Evans,{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} (a former girlfriend
- now a doctoral student at the University of Cambridge).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Talking about ''Kings & Queens'', Jamie said "I didn’t do my second album. I did my third one instead."

''[[Kings and Queens (Jamie T album)|Kings & Queens]]'' reached No. 2 in the UK Albums chart. After its release [[Zane Lowe]], on his BBC Radio 1 show, declared ''Kings & Queens'' his favourite album of 2009, describing the album as "a brilliant, poignant, incredible observational record" and "flawless".

On 25 September 2009, Jamie cancelled his Australian tour, due to [[laryngitis]]. Six days later, he postponed the first six shows of his sellout UK tour. A week later, however, Jamie cancelled the entire UK and European tours. A statement on his website informs that all Australia, UK and Europe scheduled shows were cancelled and since then, all three tours were rescheduled.

===''The Man's Machine'' (2009)===
On 26 October, Jamie announced he would be releasing a third EP from the album, ''The Man's Machine''. The four-track EP will consist of "The Man’s Machine", "Jenny Can Rely on Me", "Man Not a Monster" and "Believing in Things That Can’t Be Done". ''The Man’s Machine'' EP was released on CD and 12" vinyl on 23 November 2009.

A re-recorded version of "Emily's Heart" premiered as [[Zane Lowe]]'s Hottest Record In The World on 19 January 2010, and it was confirmed as the next single, with a cover of [[Bruce Springsteen]]'s "Atlantic City" serving as the B-side. It was released on 15 March.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jamie-t.com/index.php/emilys-heart-new-version-released-15th-march-new-merchandise-shop/ |title=Emily’s Heart – New Version Released 15th March |date=19 January 2010 |work=jamie-t.com |access-date=20 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304072758/http://www.jamie-t.com/index.php/emilys-heart-new-version-released-15th-march-new-merchandise-shop/ |archive-date= 4 March 2010 }}</ref>
