'''Jan Vetter''' (born 27 October 1963), better known as '''Farin Urlaub'''<ref name="meerschwein p71">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=71}}.</ref> (from the German ''Fahr in Urlaub!'', "Go on holiday!"), is a German singer, guitarist and songwriter. He is best known as the guitarist/vocalist for [[punk rock]] band [[Die Ärzte]]. He has also been a solo artist since 2001, touring with his band, the Farin Urlaub Racing Team. His releases starting in 2006 are credited to the band.

== Early life ==

Vetter was born on 27 October 1963 in [[West Berlin]].<ref name="meerschwein p71" /> Until the age of seven, he lived with his mother in a flat in Berlin's [[Moabit]] district, and then in [[Frohnau]] until he was 18.<ref name="meerschwein p70">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=70}}.</ref> His parents were low-income civil servants, and he has a younger half-sister named Julia. His mother often played records by [[The Beatles]], and Vetter was introduced to music at a young age.<ref name="meerschwein p70" />

When he was nine, Vetter decided to take guitar lessons with an elderly woman who taught him classical standards. He played guitar while visiting holiday camps.<ref name="meerschwein p71"/> A later music teacher advised him: "Whatever you do when you grow up, don't do anything with music!".<ref name="meerschwein p74">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=74}}.</ref> At the age of 16, Vetter went on a school trip to London, and returned home as a punk with dyed blonde hair.<ref name="meerschwein p72">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=72}}.</ref>

In 1980, he met Dirk Felsenheimer (later known as [[Bela B.]]) at the club Ballhaus [[Spandau]], one of the few clubs in West Berlin that occasionally played [[punk rock]]. Vetter joined Felsenheimer's band [[Soilent Grün]], replacing the previous guitar player whose guitar had been stolen.<ref name="meerschwein p4">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=4}}.</ref><ref name="meerschwein p5">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=5}}.</ref> When it was time to come up with stage names, Vetter decided to refer to his favourite hobby of travelling, contracting the German phrase ''"Fahr in Urlaub"'' ("Go on holiday") to Farin Urlaub.<ref name="meerschwein p84">{{harvp|Karg|2001|p=84}}.</ref> After completing his ''[[Abitur]]'' in 1981,<ref name="meerschwein p71" /> Vetter enrolled in [[archaeology]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]], but soon quit his studies to focus on his musical career.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Career==
[[Image:Farin Urlaub-cropped.jpg|thumb|Farin Urlaub on holiday in Spain, 2003]]

After the breakup of [[Soilent Grün]] in 1982, Urlaub, Felsenheimer, and Hans Runge (Sahnie) formed [[Die Ärzte]]. Urlaub told the youth magazine ''[[Bravo (magazine)|Bravo]]'' that his surname was Vetter-Marciniak to find out which of his fans really knew him well; fan mail addressed to "Jan Vetter-Marciniak" he would throw out unread.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Even today his surname is often erroneously cited as "Vetter-Marciniak".

In 1988, at the height of their popularity, Urlaub and Felsenheimer decided to split up, and after one final tour with the new bass-player, [[Hagen Liebing]], Die Ärzte disbanded.

In 1989, Urlaub formed [[King Køng]] with, among others, drummer Uwe Hoffmann, who had been Die Ärzte's producer. Urlaub called himself "Jan" during this time, as he wanted to distance himself from his time with Die Ärzte. The group was never successful, and Urlaub declared it defunct in 1999.

Bela's band Depp Jones was not really successful either, so in 1993 they decided to reform Die Ärzte. They invited former Depp Jones guitarist Rodrigo González to take over bass duties. They released the comeback album ''Die Bestie in Menschengestalt'' ("The Beast in Human Form") and the single "[[Schrei nach Liebe]]" ("Cry for Love")

In 2001, Urlaub started his solo career with the album ''[[Endlich Urlaub!]]'' (literally translated meaning "Finally Holiday!", but also a pun on his pseudonym, "Urlaub"). ''[[Am Ende der Sonne]]'' ("At the End of the Sun") was released in 2005, followed by ''[[Livealbum of Death]]'' in 2006. The next album he chose to release under the name Farin Urlaub Racing Team, after the band playing alongside him when performing live. The next album titled ''[[Die Wahrheit übers Lügen]]'' ("The Truth About Lying") was released on 31 October 2008.
His most recent studio album, ''Faszination Weltraum'' ("Outer  Space Fascination"), was released in 2014, as well as a second live compilation album, ''Danger!'', in 2015.

Besides Urlaub's solo career, Die Ärzte continued to release. In November 2007, their album, ''[[Jazz ist anders]]'' ("Jazz is different") was released and was ranked No. 1 in the German [[Media Control Charts]] for six consecutive weeks.<ref>See [http://www.gfk-entertainment.com/news/pressemitteilungen/die-charts-in-weihnachtsstimmung.html Media Control press release concerning Christmas sales 2007 (German)]</ref> It was followed by ''[[Auch (album)|auch]]'' ("also") in April 2012 and ''[[Hell (Die Ärzte album)|Hell]]'' in October 2020, with Urlaub playing a large role in both in addition to his solo work.

== Musical style ==
Since his childhood, Urlaub has been influenced by [[The Beatles]] and [[Frank Zappa]].<ref name="meerschwein p71" /> In addition, he listens to [[Johnny Cash]], [[Depeche Mode]], and "more or less everything except [[free jazz]] and [[techno]]."{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} He has stated that he does not consider himself to be a particularly good guitarist. He says that he often plays "unclean" chords and that he has only a very limited ability to read music, although this has not affected his success as a musician. Urlaub is familiar with many styles ranging from punk to rock, [[funk]] (''Deine Freundin''), [[ska]] (''Dermitder''), [[reggae]], [[dancehall]], [[Country music|country]] and even, albeit in a jocular manner, in [[Volkstümliche Musik]] (''Wenn es Abend wird'').{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

According to some reports,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} the difference between the songs Urlaub has written solo and those he has written for Die Ärzte is that his solo pieces are more personal and topical. He tried to make his songs for Die Ärzte as "timeless" and funny as possible, influenced by the [[Comedian Harmonists]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Many of his songs are about being left by one's partner (''Zu spät'' (Too late), ''Wegen dir'' (Because of you), ''Wie am ersten Tag'' (Like on the first day), ''Komm zurück'' (Come back), ''Nie gesagt'' (Never told you), ''OK'', ''1000 Jahre schlechten Sex'' (1000 years of bad sex), ''Nichts in der Welt'' (Nothing in the world)) or are just nonsense (''Buddy Holly's Brille'' (Buddy Holly's glasses), ''Außerirdische'' (Extraterrestrials), ''WAMMW'' (Abbreviation for ''Wenn alle Männer Mädchen wären'' — If all men were girls)).

Since the reunion of Die Ärzte, Urlaub has also written socially critical and political songs (''Kopfüber in die Hölle'' (Headfirst into hell), ''Schrei nach Liebe'' (Cry for love), ''Schunder-Song,'' ''Der Misanthrop,'' ''Rebell,'' ''Deine Schuld'' (Your fault), ''Nicht allein'' (Not alone)).

Whereas his first solo album contained several very satirical texts, ''Am Ende der Sonne'' deals with more serious themes such as politics, social criticism, and personal subjects. In some solo pieces, Urlaub also shows some tendency towards [[ska punk]] (''Dermitder'' ("The Guy With The", contextually, "der Mann mit der Posaune" — the man with the trombone), ''1000 Jahre schlechten Sex'' (1000 years of bad sex)).

==Farin Urlaub Racing Team==
The '''Farin Urlaub Racing Team''' (abbreviated to "FURT") is the band with whom Urlaub performs his solo work. So far, he has completed four tours with the band. He describes the difference between Die Ärzte and the Farin Urlaub Racing Team as follows: "With Die Ärzte, complete anarchy dominates on stage, whereas with the Racing Team you have an orchestra full of dynamite."<ref>Fritz-Interview on 29 March 2005</ref>
