==History==

===2011–2012: Formation and ''The X Factor''===
In 2007, Blair Dreelan of Alpha Dog Management met 14-year-old Josh Cuthbert, who was auditioning for the [[The X Factor (UK series 4)|fourth series]] of ''[[The X Factor (UK TV series)|The X Factor]]'' in front of judges [[Simon Cowell]], [[Louis Walsh]], [[Sharon Osbourne]] and [[Dannii Minogue]]. Cuthbert failed to progress to the bootcamp stage, but Dreelan believed that he looked like a pop star and was impressed by his voice: "I began to sort of work with him on various little projects like just sort of recording stuff because I've got a recording studio in [[Swindon]]."<ref name="Dreelan interview"/> In 2011, Cuthbert and Jaymi Hensley met whilst studying performing arts at the [[Sylvia Young Theatre School]] in [[Westminster]] and later decided to put a band together. Former jockey Jamie "JJ" Hamblett<ref name="JJ jockey"/> was later added to the group by Dreelan, and they named themselves Triple J (due to each member sharing the same initial).<ref name="Dreelan interview">{{cite news|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/lads/799057/union-j%E2%80%99s-manager-blair-dreelan-%E2%80%9Cspooky%E2%80%9D-george-shelley-ella-henderson-love-|title=Union J's manager Blair Dreelan on "spooky" George Shelley, the Ella Henderson love triangle, and who smells the best|last=Franklin|first=Lauren|date=1 December 2012|publisher=[[Sugarscape.com]]|access-date=14 November 2013}}</ref>

In May 2012, after eight months together, Triple J and soloist George Shelley both auditioned in London for the [[The X Factor (UK series 9)|ninth series]] of ''The X Factor'' in front of judges Walsh, [[Gary Barlow]], [[Tulisa]] and [[Nicole Scherzinger]]. Triple J performed [[Rihanna]]'s international hit "[[We Found Love]]", whilst George covered an acoustic version of [[Britney Spears]]' "[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]" – in which he also incorporated his guitar. Both acts progressed to the next stage of the competition, receiving positive critique from all judges present.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCZ223YaX-8|title=Hot hunks' auditions – The X Factor UK 2012|date=16 September 2012|publisher=YouTube|access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> Bootcamp saw Shelley perform [[Labrinth]]'s "[[Earthquake (Labrinth song)|Earthquake]]", competing against female contestants; Charlie Cammish and Meg O'Neill. Triple J first sang [[Maroon 5]]'s "[[Moves Like Jagger]]", before contending for the final place at judges' houses with [[GMD3]] (later [[District3]]). They covered [[Chris Brown]]'s "[[Yeah 3x]]", but were sent home after GMD3 were eventually chosen for judges' houses. However, following [[Rough Copy]]'s forced withdrawal from the show, Dreelan was contacted by ''The X Factor'' producers with an offer for the group to return, on the basis that Shelley was added to the three-piece. All parties accepted the offer and the band – now a four-piece – became Union J and advanced to judges' houses alongside fellow recalled Times Red in the groups category, mentored by Walsh.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/09/24/the-x-factor-24-become-25-as-two-groups-replace-rough-copy-583745/|title=The X Factor: 24 become 25 as two groups replace Rough Copy|date=24 September 2012|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[DMG Media]]|access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> The band's first performance as a four-piece was an acoustic cover of [[Carly Rae Jepsen]]'s "[[Call Me Maybe]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Od76EtNMhds |title=Union J's performance – Carly Rae Jepsen's Call Me Maybe – The X Factor UK 2012|publisher=YouTube|date=29 September 2012|access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> Walsh put them through to the live shows alongside District3 and MK1, and they instantly proved popular with social media users.

In week 1 of the live shows, Union J performed [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Don't Stop Me Now]]". Despite negative feedback from the other judges, they progressed through to the next week after placing fourth in voting statistics behind [[Chris Maloney (singer)|Christopher Maloney]], [[Jahméne Douglas]] and [[Ella Henderson]], respectively.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xfactor.itv.com/2012/articles/x-factor-insider/read_the-x-factor-voting-numbers-revealed-here_item_100282.htm|title=The X Factor voting numbers revealed HERE!|publisher=[[itv.com]]|date=9 December 2012|access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> In week 4, the group received the fewest public votes with Jade Ellis, but were saved by Barlow, Scherzinger and Walsh. They found themselves in the bottom two again in week 6, against District3, but were saved for a second time by Barlow and Scherzinger, with Walsh refusing to vote between his acts. Union J were in the bottom two for a third time in the quarter-final, where they were saved by Walsh, Barlow and Tulisa over [[Rylan Clark]]. They were eliminated in the semi-final on 2 December, finishing in fourth place. It was later reported that their winning single would have been a cover of [[Demi Lovato]]'s "[[Skyscraper (song)|Skyscraper]]",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/film-and-tv/799072/union-j-record-demi-lovatos-skyscraper-x-factor-winners-single|title=Union J to record Demi Lovato's Skyscraper as X Factor winner's single?|date=15 September 2012|publisher=[[Sugarscape]]|access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> which is featured on [[Union J (album)|their debut album]].

Hensley told [[Digital Spy]], "We did write for [their first] album and we'd done about 14 songs but they didn't go on the album, maybe because they weren't right.

Shelley left the group in March 2016; speaking exclusively to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''{{'}}s [[Dan Wootton]], Cuthbert blamed Shelley's departure on the latter's changing manner following his stint on ''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!]]''.

Josh Lloyd-Cuthbert then quit the band in October, leaving Hamblett and Hensley as a duo. Cuthbert told ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'':

<blockquote>
<p>"The music industry is really difficult. It plays with your emotions, it's ups and downs and you go through different managers. Over the last few years we’ve had different managers and we've been promised the world and been let down. We've got a label now which are great and I respect them lots and have nothing but good words to say about them, but it is difficult when you change members.</p>
<p>George obviously left, which was hard for us, but everyone has different reasons and has different things going on. Now that I'm making this decision myself I understand why George made that decision two years ago.</p>
<p>At the time you don't really get it, until you have the same feelings as him, which I now have. I spoke to them on the phone and I just hope that they support me, I want to stay friends with the boys, I love them."<ref name="OK!"/></p>
</blockquote>

The remaining members of Union J released their third and final single from ''Who Would've Thought'', called "Paralysed", on 14 December 2018, with a video appearing on their YouTube channel on January 25th 2019. JJ Hamblett and Jaymi Hensley, as a duo, haven't released any new singles to date.
