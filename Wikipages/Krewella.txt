As of July 2018, they are featured in [[Coke Studio (Pakistani season 11)|''Coke Studio (Pakistan)'' Season 11]] as featured artists and were also part of the well-received Season promo song "[[Hum Dekhenge]]" which was rendition of Poem written by [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1764550/4-7-reasons-looking-forward-coke-studio-season-11/|title=7 reasons we are looking forward to 'Coke Studio Season 11'|date=2018-07-23|work=The Express Tribune|access-date=2018-07-23|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cokestudio.com.pk/season11/krewella.html|title=Artists - Season 11 - Coke Studio Pakistan|website=Cokestudio.com.pk}}</ref> Their featured [[Coke Studio (Pakistan)|Coke Studio]] debut song "Runaway" was an instant hit in [[Pakistan]]. The song also was a reconnect with their Pakistani roots. Paired with the raw power of Riaz Qadri and Ghulam Ali Qadri’s folk vocals, the bank brought their first fusion track about hijr (separation from a beloved). Primarily an English song, Jahan and Yasmine also sing in one of their native languages for the first time. The vocal harmonies combined with a driving dholak groove and soulful sarangi is what makes "Runaway" a tasteful juxtaposition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cokestudio.com.pk/season11/episode2.html?WT.cl=1&WT.mn=Episode2|title=Season 11 Episode 2 - Coke Studio Pakistan|website=Cokestudio.com.pk}}</ref> As of January 2020, the duo released a new track called "[[Greenlights (song)|Greenlights]]",<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2dgChEZA4M/] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> that has gained around 1.2 million views since this entry and would give Krewella their second number one on Billboard’s Dance/Mix Show Airplay chart in April 2020.
