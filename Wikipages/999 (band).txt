'''999''' are an English <!--Lead section, as per WIKI:MOS, is supposed to aim for generality. Specific subgenre and style are to follow afterward-->[[punk rock]] band, formed in [[London]] in December 1976.<ref name="AllMusic.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/999-mn0000919282|title=999 &#124; Biography, Albums, Streaming Links|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=16 September 2020}}</ref> From the period of 1976 to 1985, the line-up of 999 consisted of Nick Cash (vocals, guitar), Guy Days (lead guitar), Jon Watson (bass guitar) and Pablo LaBritain (drums). LaBritain was temporarily replaced in 1980 by drummer Paul Edward aka 'Ed Case' while he recovered from a motor accident.  Bassist Jon Watson left the band in 1985 and was replaced by Danny Palmer, who was succeeded by Arturo Bassick in 1991.

Between 1978 and 2007, 999 released fourteen [[Single (music)|singles]] and twelve [[studio album]]s. Five of the singles released by 999 between 1978 and 1981 charted within the Top 75 in the [[UK Singles Chart]], with one further single released by 999 in 1978, "Homicide", charting within the Top 40. In addition, as a result of extensive touring in the [[United States]] in the early 1980s, the band's third and fourth studio albums: ''[[The Biggest Prize in Sport]]'' and ''Concrete,'' each charted on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].

Despite having formed in 1976, 999 have only experienced two permanent changes to their original line-up<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/999-Nick%20Cash%20Interview-2007.htm/|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090709033359/http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/999-Nick%20Cash%20Interview-2007.htm|url-status=dead|title=Punk77.|archive-date=9 July 2009}}</ref> and has continued to record and play live, leading [[AllMusic]] to describe the band as "one of the longest-lived groups of the [[punk rock|punk era]]."<ref name="AllMusic.com"/>

==Career==
Named after the UK's [[999 (emergency telephone number)|emergency telephone number]], 999 was founded in London by singer and guitarist Nick Cash, and Guy Days. Cash and Days are brothers. The former was a member of the [[Pub rock (United Kingdom)|pub rock]] band [[Kilburn and the High-Roads]], and the latter was a [[Session musician|session]] guitarist who played on some of the band's [[demo (music)|demo]] tapes.<ref name="Thompson 2000 519">{{cite book |title= ''Alternative Rock''|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Miller Freeman Books|location= San Francisco|page= 519}}</ref> In late 1976, they placed an advertisement in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' for band members and ended up turning down [[Chrissie Hynde]] ([[The Pretenders]]), [[Jon Moss]] ([[Culture Club]]) and [[Tony James (musician)|Tony James]] ([[Generation X (band)|Generation X]]).<ref>[http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/999-1.htm ''999: A History (Part One)'' on www.punk77.co.uk: A history of UK Punk Rock from 1976–79];</ref> They recruited Jon Watson on bass and Pablo LaBritain on [[Drum kit|drums]], LaBritain having briefly played with [[the Clash]].<ref>{{cite book |title= ''The Clash''|last= Peachey|first= Mal |year= 2008|publisher= Atlantic Books|location= Great Britain|page= 62}}</ref> The band that eventually became known as 999 performed their first [[concert]] at the [[Northampton]] Cricket Club in January 1977.<ref>[http://punkmodpop.free.fr/999_pic.htm 999 on Punkmodpop] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006143140/http://punkmodpop.free.fr/999_pic.htm |date=6 October 2008 }}</ref> After experimenting with several different band names, the band became 999 in May 1977.<ref>{{cite book |title= ''70s Music''|last= Larkin|first= Colin|year= 2002|publisher= Virgin Books|location= London|isbn= 1-85227-947-8|page= 307.}}</ref>

[[File:999BUTTON.jpg|120px|left|thumb|999 button, Toronto-the Edge Club present]]999 soon established themselves as a powerful live act on the London punk scene and became regulars at the [[Hope and Anchor, Islington]].<ref name="Thompson 2000 519"/> On the strength of their well received, self-financed debut [[Single (music)|single]], 999 were signed to [[United Artists Records]] around the same time as the [[Buzzcocks]].<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Up Yours!

Their [[999 (album)|self-titled debut album]], [[Record producer|produced]] by Andy Arthurs, was released in March 1978. One retrospective review claimed it "demonstrated their limitations as well as their strengths. The 45 cuts like "Me And My Desire" and "Emergency" demonstrated the latter, but the album lacked that special ingredient, uniqueness or originality to make it stand out from the crowd."<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Up Yours! A Guide to UK Punk, New Wave & Early Post Punk''|last= Joynson|first= Vernon|year= 2001|publisher= Borderline Publications|location= Wolverhampton|page= 246}}</ref> The album reached No.&nbsp;53 in the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The following year, the song "Emergency" from the album appeared — alongside songs by bands like [[The Jam]] and [[The Stranglers]] — on the punk compilation ''20 of Another Kind''. That album reached No.&nbsp;45 in the UK [[Record chart|chart]]. Years later, "Emergency" was included in ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]'' magazine's list of the best punk rock singles of all time.<ref>Mojo (October 2001) – ''100 Punk Scorchers '', Issue 95, London;</ref>

The band's second album, ''[[Separates]]'' was produced by [[Martin Rushent]]. One reviewer lists it as one of the best punk albums of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiljaiset.sci.fi/punknet/top100lp.htm |first=Steve |last=Gardner |year=1996 |title=Hiljaiset Levyt: 100 Best Punk LP's |quote=" ‘Homicide’ from this LP, which was about their most popular song, was pretty close to disco, but there's plenty of other catchy ones here, like ‘Tulse Hill Night’, ‘Out Of Reach’ or ‘Let's Face It’." |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122101051/http://www.hiljaiset.sci.fi/punknet/top100lp.htm |archive-date=22 November 2007 }}</ref>  In the United States, a slightly altered version of ''Separates'', re-titled ''High Energy Plan'', became the band's first American release.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/705100 |title=999 – High Energy Plan (Vinyl, LP, Album) at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |access-date=18 April 2012}}</ref> In October 1978, a month after the album's release, 999 recorded their only session for [[John Peel]] at [[BBC Radio 1]].<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/artists/a/999/ 999’s John Peel Session on BBC Radio 1]; Bbc.co.uk</ref> 999 also played at Front Row Festival, a three-week event at the Hope and Anchor in late November and early December 1977. This resulted in the band's inclusion, alongside the likes of [[Wilko Johnson]], [[The Only Ones]], [[The Saints (Australian band)|the Saints]], [[The Stranglers]], [[X-Ray Spex]], and [[XTC]], on a hit double LP of recordings from the festival.

999 toured widely in the United States and the band was rewarded when their albums ''[[The Biggest Prize In Sport]]'' and ''Concrete'' charted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. In the US, "Homicide" and "Hollywood" garnered frequent rotation on ''Rock of the 80s'' format radio stations like KROQ in Los Angeles. According to [[Dave Thompson (author)|Dave Thompson]], "For many Americans, they were the first to actually bother with the backwoods, playing places which other Brit bands hadn't heard of, and returning to them again and again. And while no one knows how many American bands were first inspired to take up arms by 999, those that did still wear their loyalties loudly."<ref>{{cite book |title= ''Alternative Rock''|last= Thompson|first= Dave|year= 2000|publisher= Miller Freeman Books|location= San Francisco|isbn= 0-87930-607-6|page= 520}}</ref>

Despite a number of minor hit singles, the band's critical appeal in Britain had begun to wane. Their stock was lifted temporarily with the arrival of the self-released ''Face To Face''. 999's popularity continued to decline steadily, leading to the group disbanding twice in the 1980s, reforming soon afterwards. They have since released several albums and continue to tour, including playing at the 11th [[Antifest]] in 2005. Bassick also plays for [[The Lurkers]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelurkers.co.uk/history.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619180525/http://thelurkers.co.uk/history.htm|url-status=dead|title=The Lurkers' Band History on their official website|archive-date=19 June 2014}}</ref>
