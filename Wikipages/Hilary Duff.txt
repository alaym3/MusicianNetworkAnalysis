'''Hilary Erhard Duff''' (born September 28, 1987) is an American actress, singer, and businesswoman. She began her acting career at a young age and quickly became labeled a [[teen idol]] as the title character of the television series, ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' and in the film based on the series, ''[[The Lizzie McGuire Movie]]'' (2003). Thereafter, she appeared in numerous mainstream films such as ''[[Cadet Kelly]]'' (2002), ''[[Agent Cody Banks]]'' (2003), ''[[Cheaper by the Dozen (2003 film)|Cheaper by the Dozen]]'' (2003) and ''[[A Cinderella Story]]'' (2004). She later appeared in independent films playing a wider range of adult-themed roles, such as a promiscuous pop star in ''[[War, Inc.]]'' (2008), a suicidal, rebellious teenager in ''[[According to Greta]]'' (2009) and as the [[Sharon Tate|title character]] in the controversial ''[[The Haunting of Sharon Tate]]'' (2019), inspired by the real life  [[Tate–LaBianca murders]]. From 2015 to 2021, Duff starred as Kelsey Peters in [[TV Land]]’s longest-running original series ''[[Younger (TV series)|Younger]]'', for which she received two [[People's Choice Awards]] nominations.

Duff first came to prominence in the music industry after releasing her debut studio album, the [[Christmas]]-themed ''[[Santa Claus Lane]]'' (2002), through [[Buena Vista Records]]. Her second album, ''[[Metamorphosis (Hilary Duff album)|Metamorphosis]]'' (2003), was hugely successful, topping the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart and earning a 3x Platinum certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). She enjoyed significant commercial success with her subsequent [[RIAA certification|Platinum]] and [[RIAA certification|Gold]]-certified albums released through [[Hollywood Records]]; ''[[Hilary Duff (album)|Hilary Duff]]'' (2004), ''[[Most Wanted (Hilary Duff album)|Most Wanted]]'' (2005) and ''[[Dignity (Hilary Duff album)|Dignity]]'' (2007). Following a hiatus from music, Duff signed with [[RCA Records]] for her fifth album, ''[[Breathe In. Breathe Out.]]'' (2015), which debuted within the top-five in Australia, Canada and the United States. Duff has also been hailed as an inspiration by subsequent [[Disney Channel|Disney]] teen stars such as [[Miley Cyrus]], [[Demi Lovato]], [[Bridgit Mendler]] and [[Selena Gomez]], and has sold an estimated 15 million records worldwide.<ref name="Hilary Duff">{{cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6177411/hilary-duff-signs-to-rca-records|title=Hilary Duff Signs to RCA Records|last=Trakin|first=Roy|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=July 23, 2014|access-date=October 13, 2014}}</ref>

In addition to music and acting, she has also co-authored a trilogy of novels, beginning with ''[[Elixir (Duff novel)|Elixir]]'' (2010), which became a [[New York Times best seller|''New York Times'' best seller]], and followed by the sequels ''[[Devoted]]'' (2011) and ''True'' (2013). Duff's success in the entertainment industry led her to venture into business with fashion lines of her own such as [[Stuff by Hilary Duff]], [[Femme for DKNY]] and most recently the "Muse x Hilary Duff" collection, a collaborative effort with [[GlassesUSA]] which was credited to have boosted GlassesUSA's sales for its premium brands. She has also invested in a number of businesses ranging from cosmetics to children's products. In 2019, she was appointed as the [[chief brand officer]] of Naturalena Brands' "Happy Little Camper" and "Veeda" lines of products; although this partnership ended with a lawsuit in 2021.

''Younger'''s creator Darren Star will be attached to the project.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Petski|first=Denise|date=2020-05-08|title='Younger' Spinoff Starring Hilary Duff In The Works|url=https://deadline.com/2020/05/younger-spinoff-starring-hilary-duff-in-works-darren-starr-sutton-foster-1202930088/|access-date=2021-02-10|website=Deadline|language=en-US}}</ref> Star explained in April 2021 that the spinoff will be like a "female ''[[Entourage (American TV series)|Entourage]]''", and will focus on Kelsey Peters' adventure in Los Angeles, instead of New York.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2021/04/darren-star-says-hilary-duff-younger-spinoff-like-entourage.html|title=Hilary Duff's Younger Spinoff Would be Like 'Female Entourage,' Says Darren Star|date=April 9, 2021}}</ref> However, on June 10, 2021, following the series’ conclusion, it has been revealed that the spin-off is no longer in the works, due to Duff being cast on the ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' spin-off, ''How I Met Your Father''. According to creator [[Darren Star]], he stated that the ''Kelsey'' spin-off has been resolved after the series finale, regardless of any notion of a spin-off. Star stated that "it was always going to end with Kelsey doing her own thing, alone, heading to [[Los Angeles]]".<ref>{{cite web|last=Swift|first=Andy|url=https://www.tvline.com/2021/06/10/younger-spinoff-cancelled-hilary-duff-not-returning-kelsey|title=''Younger''{{'s}} Kelsey Spinoff Is 'Pretty Much Off the Table', Darren Star Says|website=[[TV Line]]|date=June 10, 2021|access-date=June 10, 2021}}</ref> The series' soundtrack album was released digitally in July 2021, and Duff's cover of [[Dolly Parton]]'s "[[9 to 5 (Dolly Parton song)|9 to 5]]" which she performed in the season six premiere together with [[Sutton Foster]] and [[Miriam Shor]] was included.

In July 2021, news emerged that Duff will be suing Naturalena Brands for an alleged breach of contract and misappropriation of the right of publicity. The suit alleges, "This action is the result of [Naturalena's] refusal to honor their contractual commitments under a celebrity endorsement agreement and associated  guarantee relating to Hilary Duff's endorsement of [Naturalena's] natural baby and feminine hygiene products." The lawsuit further claims that 
Naturalena "concocted a bogus claim of force majeure," citing the COVID-19 pandemic, and argued that the endorsement agreement was terminated. Additionally, the lawsuit claimed that Naturalena "apparently believed that their sales would be better than they turned out to be." The lawsuit also states that despite allegedly refusing to pay Duff and claiming to have ended the endorsement deal, the company continued to use Duff's name and likeness to promote its products.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2021/07/20/actress-hilary-duff-sues-irvine-based-naturalena-brands-for-alleged-breach-of-contract/ |title=Actress Hilary Duff Sues Irvine-Based Naturalena Brands For Alleged Breach Of Contract |work=CBSLA.com |date=July 20, 2021 |access-date=July 28, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Social media controversies===

Duff created media attention in [[Halloween]] of 2016 due to the costumes she and ex-boyfriend Jason Walsh wore to a party. Duff and Walsh wore a pilgrim and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] costume respectively, drawing criticism online with some social media users accusing them of [[cultural appropriation]]. Duff's act happened around the same time the [[Dakota Access Pipeline]] issue arose. Following the backlash, both Duff and Walsh posted apology messages on their [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]] accounts, respectively.<ref>{{cite news|first=Carly|last=Mallenbaum|url=https://amp.usatoday.com/amp/93019884|title=Hilary Duff is 'SO sorry' about her offensive Halloween costume|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=October 31, 2016|access-date=January 7, 2019}}</ref>

In May 2018, Duff uploaded a series of Instagram stories to her Instagram account, publicly condemning her New York apartment neighbor Dieter Addison. She claimed that Addison smoked "cigarettes and weed all night long" and that her "apartment reeks". She further added "We know your parents pay your rent. We know you've never worked a day in your life—must be nice," and warned the neighbor to "have some respect for your neighbors who work hard to live in that building. Don't be a dick dude—and put your trash down the shoot". However, the confrontation continued beyond social media, when Duff's then-boyfriend [[Matthew Koma]] punched him in the face, and the police confirmed that an altercation occurred. Duff's representative then issued a statement saying "Hilary and her young son have been subjected to excessive [[secondhand smoke]], late night noise, garbage in the hallways, and an overall hazardous living environment from this man for months now. She tried numerous times in polite ways to handle this situation including countless sessions with the landlords of the building. As every mother knows, protecting your kid has to come first and foremost and that is her primary goal. She reached a breaking point after a 15 hour work day and yet another sleepless night". Koma's representative then confirmed that the allegations of the altercation between him and Addison were "untrue". Duff's allegations of Addison's irresponsibility was corroborated by their neighbors, including journalist Shelley Ross who tweeted that she shares the same neighbor as Duff and that Addison smoked cigarettes and is "trying to cover his cracks". She added that Koma merely asked Addison to be a "cooperative neighbor", and that Addison called the police to harass Duff and her family.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dupre|first=Elyse|url=https://www.eonline.com/news/935791/hilary-duff-publicly-shames-her-neighbor-for-smoking|title=Hilary Duff Speaks Out After Publicly Shaming Her Neighbor for Smoking|date=May 17, 2018|work=[[E!]]}}</ref> In the aftermath of the incident, Addison claimed he received threats on his social media, and eventually made his account private. He planned to take out a [[restraining order]] against Duff, but no development on the matter has been heard since.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Samantha|title=Dieter Addison: 5 Things About Neighbor Hilary Duff Called Out for Allegedly Smoking Weed & More|url=https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/17/who-is-dieter-addison-hilary-duff-neighbor/|date=May 17, 2018|work=[[Hollywood Life]]}}</ref>

Duff once again attracted media attention in May 2020 after a thread posted by a user on Twitter claimed Duff to be [[sex trafficking]] her son. The user caused Duff to be a [[Twitter trends|trending]] topic on Twitter for the entire day. The rumor stemmed from a since-deleted Instagram story upload by Duff back in March 2020 of her celebrating her son's birthday which involved her preparing a photo collage. One of the photographs showed her son partially nude and covered in lotion. Responding to the allegations, Duff tweeted on her Twitter account saying, "Everyone bored af right now I know..but this is actually disgusting..... whoever dreamed this one up and put this garbage into the universe should take a break from their damn phone. Maybe get a hobby". Her statement has since been retweeted more than 23,000 times, and both the Twitter and [[Reddit]] threads falsely accusing her have been deleted.<ref>{{cite news|last=Scott|first=Katie|title=Hilary Duff responds to child-trafficking rumours about her son|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/6981986/hilary-duff-response-child-trafficking-rumours/amp/|work=[[Global News]]|date=May 25, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ivie|first=Devon|title=Hilary Duff Spent Her Holiday Weekend Denying 'Garbage' Child-Trafficking Conspiracy|url=https://www.vulture.com/amp/2020/05/hilary-duff-responds-to-child-trafficking-claims.html|date=May 24, 2020|website=[[Vulture.com]]}}</ref>

===Disapproval of paparazzi===

Duff is very vocal about her disapproval of paparazzi photographing children.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/LIFE/usaedition/2014-03-25-Celebs-push-back-paparazzi-and-they-might-be-winning_ST_U.htm|title=Celebrities push back against the paparazzi|last=Puente|first=Maria|website=Usatoday30.usatoday.com|date=March 24, 2014|access-date=September 27, 2014}}</ref> In 2014, Duff expressed her anger on Twitter regarding two paparazzi who were taking pictures of her son without her consent.

In February 2020, Duff uploaded an Instagram video post documenting her confrontation with a photographer who was taking photographs of her children at her son's football game. In the video she was seen telling the photographer, "I'm asking you human to human, as a mother, if you don't know anyone here, can you please stop taking pictures of our children playing football this morning".<ref>{{cite news|last=Samhan|first=Jamie|title=Hilary Duff Being Sued By Photographer After She Confronted Him For Taking Pictures Of Her Kids|url=https://etcanada.com/news/749293/hilary-duff-being-sued-by-photographer-after-she-confronted-him-for-taking-pictures-of-her-kids/|work=[[Entertainment Tonight Canada]]|date=February 20, 2021}}</ref> She clarified the situation in a series of Instagram stories uploads the day after, saying that it was "really highly frustrating" and that the police dismissed her complaint because she was at a public park when the incident happened. She voiced out her dissatisfaction and demanded for the law to be changed. The video has since been viewed for more than 2 million times as of November 2020.<ref>{{cite web|last=Torres|first=Libby|title=Hilary Duff wants the laws to be changed after a man took photos at her son's football game|url=https://www.insider.com/hilary-duff-son-paparazzi-laws-changed-video-2020-2|date=February 25, 2020|website=[[Insider.com]]}}</ref>

In February 2021, the aforementioned photographer, later identified as Darryl Wilkins, filed a lawsuit against Duff and talk show host [[Wendy Williams]], accusing them of [[libel]] and [[slander]]. He claims that Duff allegedly accused him of "reprehensible and despicable conduct including by innuendo that he was a child predator". Regarding Williams, he accused her of allegedly repeating the defamatory statements on her TV show, when she shared Duff's clip on an episode of ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]''. Wilkins further elaborated in his complaint that the alleged words uttered by Duff were "false statements because Wilkins is not a [[pedophile]] or child predator and was attempting to take photographs as a photographer and not as a paparazzi or [[stalker]] or with mal intent or evil wrongdoing". He added that he has suffered general damages to his reputation, business, trade, profession, and occupation as a result of Duff and Williams' alleged words about him.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walters|first=Liz|title=Hilary Duff & Wendy Williams Sued For Slander By Photographer|url=https://theblast.com/6482663/hilary-duff-wendy-williams-sued-for-slander-by-photographer|date=February 20, 2021|website=theblast.com}}</ref>

''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'' published a scathing opinion piece that went on to say, "you told people you were going to Harvard (ambiguous). It’s Harvard (extension), which (disclaimer) by the way is a perfectly great option for education."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/2/28/duff-at-harvard-hilary-duff-is/|title=Duff at Harvard|date=February 28, 2005|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref> The editorial was later heavily criticized by ''The Harvard Crimson'' itself.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/3/7/crimson-gives-extension-school-a-bad/|title=Crimson Gives Extension School A Bad Rap|date=March 7, 2005|first=Jeff|last=Amsel|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]|access-date=August 9, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1497930/hilary-duff-is-a-loser-and-a-chicken-harvard-college-paper-says/|title='Hilary Duff is a Loser and a Chicken,' Harvard College Paper Says|date=March 9, 2005|access-date=August 9, 2021|website=[[MTV News]]|first=Jennifer|last=Vineyard}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2005/2/10/at-harvard-one-duff-is-not/|title=At Harvard, One Duff is not Enough|date=February 10, 2005|first=Illeana|last=Ojeda|newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]]}}</ref>

Duff is a strong [[animal rights]] supporter and commented when asked what she would do if she was not a celebrity, "I always wanted to be a [[veterinarian]] when I was younger, but then I figured out that animals actually die there, so that was not the job for me. Definitely something with kids or animals or something like that."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.peta2.com/OUTTHERE/o-gossip104.asp|title=PETA2 // Out There // On Our Radar|website=Peta2.com|access-date=February 17, 2010}}{{Dubious|date=March 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, a few months after giving birth to her son, Duff was actively involved in the [[Johnson's Baby]] Cares campaign.

Towards the start of the Christmas shopping season in November 2013, Duff teamed up with [[Duracell]] in Canada for a campaign especially for kids in hospitals.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ADDING MULTIMEDIA Hilary Duff and Duracell Power Smiles for Children in Need This Holiday Season|url=https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20131204006532/en/ADDING%C2%A0MULTIMEDIA-Hilary-Duff-Duracell-Power-Smiles-Children|date=2013-12-05|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-08}}</ref> The campaign called Powering Holiday Smiles donated 20,000 batteries to hospitals across Canada in order to power lifesaving medical devices and the thousands of playroom toys and games that children and their families would be using during the holiday season of 2013 and beyond. The campaign encourages Canadians to buy Duracell Quantum AA-16 batteries, in which for every packet sold, one dollar will be donated to the [[Children's Miracle Network]]. The campaign began on November 22 and ended on December 27, 2013. In order to promote the campaign, Duff paid a visit to [[The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto|The Hospital for Sick Children]] in Toronto, Ontario, to hand out brand new toys supplied by [[Hasbro]]. She has discussed the campaign on [[Breakfast Television (City Toronto)|Breakfast Television Toronto]], a radio show, and in numerous magazine interviews.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/calgaryherald/20131204006532/en/Hilary-Duff-Duracell-Power-Smiles-Children-Holiday|title=Hilary Duff Power Smiles|website=Businesswire.com|access-date=December 3, 2013}}</ref>
