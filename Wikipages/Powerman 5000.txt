'''Powerman 5000''' (also known as ''' PM5K''') is an American rock band formed in 1991. The group has released ten albums, gaining its highest level of commercial success with 1999's ''[[Tonight the Stars Revolt!]]'', which reached number 29 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] while spawning the singles "[[When Worlds Collide (Powerman 5000 song)|When Worlds Collide]]" and "[[Nobody's Real]]". Frontman [[Spider One]], younger brother of fellow metal musician [[Rob Zombie]], has been the only consistent member of the lineup since the band's formation.

==Biography==

===Early years and breakthrough (1991–2002)===
In 1990, Spider One recorded the 12" single "Much Evil" with producer Lamar Lowder. Building on local success, including winning the Boston Phoenix/WFNX 1990 Readers' Poll "Best Rap Act" category and getting nominated for a Boston Music Award, he founded Powerman 5000 in 1991.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conscience.com/pm5k/bio.html |title=Powerman 5000 Biography |publisher=Conscience Records |url-status=bot: unknown |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19971014225142/http://www.conscience.com/pm5k/bio.html |archive-date=1997-10-14 }}</ref> Drummer Al Pahanish Jr., bassist Dorian Heartsong and guitarist Adam 12 joined the band, and percussionist Jordan Cohen joined solidifying the early lineup. In 1993, the band released an independent EP titled ''A Private Little War'', which was limited to 500 copies and only sold at shows. In 1994 and 1995, Powerman released two more independent records, ''[[True Force]]'' and ''[[The Blood-Splat Rating System]]''.<ref name="Erlewine">{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p200678/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Biography of Powerman 5000 |access-date=2009-03-03 |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen Thomas |website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> Both albums were local successes. In 1996, they performed on the second stage of [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 1996|Ozzfest]] and appeared in [[List of Beverly Hills, 90210 episodes#Season 6: 1995 to 199|an episode]] of ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'', where David and Donna filmed a music video for their song "Strike the Match".

In 1996, the band signed to [[DreamWorks Records]] and released a remastered edition of ''[[The Blood-Splat Rating System]]'' titled ''Mega!! Kung Fu Radio''.<ref name="Erlewine" /> The band toured, performing on the main stage at [[Ozzfest#Ozzfest 1997|Ozzfest 1997]] and making an appearance on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' where they performed their song "Neckbone". They released singles such as "Tokyo Vigilante #1" in 1997 and "Organizized" in 1998. In late 1998, guitarist M.33 ([[Mike Tempesta]]) joined the band as they got their biggest break. Creating a strange fusion of [[science fiction]] and "Action Rock", they released ''[[Tonight the Stars Revolt!]]'', produced by [[Sylvia Massy]], which contained the hit singles "When Worlds Collide", "Nobody's Real", and "Supernova Goes Pop". The album sold over a million copies, achieved platinum status and won a nomination from the [[Boston Music Awards]] for "Album of the Year", becoming the group's most successful release.<ref name="MusicMight">{{cite web|url=http://musicmight.com/artist/usa/powerman+5000 |title=Biography of Powerman 5000 |access-date=2009-03-03 |publisher=MusicMight |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305121640/http://musicmight.com/artist/usa/powerman+5000 |archive-date=March 5, 2009 }}</ref> The band was also nominated by the Boston Music Awards for "Best Rock Band" and won the "Rising Star Award".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.5000volt.com/PM5K/newsletter.html|title=POWERMAN 5000 FAN ALLIANCE NEWSLETTER|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20001210032700/http://www.5000volt.com/PM5K/newsletter.html|archive-date=2000-12-10}}</ref> The band would go on to tour worldwide, performing in shows and festivals such as ''[[Farmclub.com]]'' and ''[[Endfest]]'' and become a support act for [[Metallica]]'s [[Summer Sanitarium Tour]] along with [[Korn]], [[Kid Rock]] and [[System of a Down]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1430799/metallica-korn-kid-rock-pm5k-system-to-tour/|title=Metallica, Korn, Kid Rock, PM5K, System To Tour|website=Mtv.com|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref>

A follow-up album to ''Tonight the Stars Revolt!'' was recorded in 2001 titled ''[[Anyone for Doomsday?]]'', and a single, "Bombshell", had been released to radio stations. But the album was canceled just before its scheduled release.<ref name="MusicMight"/> ''Anyone for Doomsday?'' was later released under Spider's own new label, Megatronic Records, but went out of print due to legal issues. Arguments exist as to whether the record was canceled due to the events of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 terrorist attacks]] and the negative title, but the album was finished and scheduled to be released in August 2001, one full month before the attacks. Spider has said in interviews that the album was dropped because it sounded too much like the previous album and that he wanted to release something fresh and different instead of repeating himself. Conflicts thereafter caused longtime members Dorian 27 (Dorian Heartsong) and AL3 (Allan Pahanish Jr) to leave the band. Ad7 (Adrian Ost) and Siggy Sjursen were brought in to replace them.

The band gained significant mainstream exposure with its original remake of the 1980s club hit "[[Relax (song)|Relax]]", originally by [[Frankie Goes To Hollywood]]. Rapper [[Danny Boy (rapper)|DannyBoy]] guested, and the track was featured prominently during the end credits roll for the 2001 comedy film ''[[Zoolander]]'', helping to widen the band's appeal.

=== ''Transform'' and ''Destroy What You Enjoy'' (2003–2007) ===
[[File:Spider One.jpg|thumb|right|[[Spider One]]]]
In 2003, the band released ''[[Transform (Powerman 5000 album)|Transform]]'', a more punk-fueled album, completely dropping the costumes that had been featured throughout the band's ''Tonight The Stars Revolt!'' era. Containing the hit singles "Free" and "Action", ''Transform'' relied less on [[industrial metal]] effects.<ref name="Erlewine" /> After the album's release, the band began touring in the U.S., performing in shows such as [[X-Fest]] and making live appearances on ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' where they performed their song "Action", and ''[[The Late Late Show (American talk show)|The Late Late Show]]'' where they performed their song "Free" respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/the-late-late-show-with-craig-kilborn/joseph-fiennes-and-powerman-5000-1227991/|title=The Late Late Show with Craig Kilborn: Joseph Fiennes and Powerman 5000|website=TV.com|access-date=6 October 2020}}</ref> However, DreamWorks Records was bought out by [[Interscope Records]], which stopped promoting the band and declined to take over their DreamWorks contract. Undeterred, Spider continued with his own offshoot label, Megatronic Records. In 2004, new music was released, under Spider's new label, in the form of a rarities album titled ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly Vol. 1]]''.

A new tour was also started, but M.33 had been kicked out of the band<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blabbermouth.net/news/former-powerman-5000-guitarist-won-t-be-touring-with-nine-inch-nails/|title=Former POWERMAN 5000 Guitarist Won't Be Touring With NINE INCH NAILS|date=2005-01-17}}</ref> and Adam 12 left the band on good terms to focus on other interests including sound producing and recording with Argon 40.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oreilly.com/digitalmedia/2005/06/15/williams.html |title=Powerman 5000 review |website=Oreilly.com |access-date=2016-04-06}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.argon40music.com:80/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120309112546/http://www.argon40music.com/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-09 |title=Argon40 music |website=www.argon40music.com |access-date=2019-07-28 }}</ref> Former [[Alien Ant Farm]] guitarist Terry Corso and former [[Halfcocked]], (the first band on Spider's label), guitarist [[Johnny Rock Heatley]] were brought in to round out the live show. In August 2005, Powerman 5000 performed at the sixth annual [[Gathering of the Juggalos]] on the main stage. The band then signed to [[DRT Entertainment]], who released the album entitled ''[[Destroy What You Enjoy]]'' on August 1, 2006. The song "Wild World" was the first and only single on the album, with the band also filming a music video for the song. The band would go on to tour through the U.S., including a live appearance on [[G4tv]]'s [[Attack of the Show!]], where they performed the song "Return to the City of the Dead" from ''Destroy What You Enjoy''.

In 2007, Evan Rodaniche, singer and guitarist of Los Angeles band [[Cage9]] (originally from [[Panama City, Panama]]), joined the band through his acquaintance with Adrian Ost. He toured as the band's sole guitarist until later that year, when Dave Pino was added to the mix. Pino had just moved to Los Angeles and heard about the open slot through his friendship with [[Piggy D]] (bassist for Rob Zombie). Upon the departure of Siggy from the band in 2008, Gustavo Aued was brought in to replace him on bass, and later that year, drummer Gordon Heckaman joined the band (both originally from Cage9 as well), solidifying the lineup for the next album.

On May 21, 2007, Powerman 5000 claimed via a [[Myspace]] blog post that they will be releasing a new studio album in 2007. The following is taken directly from said post: ''"Considering the bands track record of putting out CDs once every three years it seems hard to believe that, yes we will put out a new disc in 2007!! It's all just beginning to develop and the wheres, whos and whats are to be determined but new rock is on the way!!"'' However, talk about the record soon simmered, and no new information was released.

Finally, in December 2008, the new track "Super Villain" premiered on the band's Myspace page, showcasing their return to their platinum-selling sound of the late 1990s. On January 28, 2009, a preview of tracks from their upcoming sixth studio album were posted on the group's Myspace page, containing clips from the songs "Super Villain", "V Is for Vampire", and "Horror Show".  Powerman 5000 posted that "Super Villain" would become available for digital purchase on February 10, 2009, on [[iTunes]] and [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]].

On April 7, 2009, Powerman 5000 released a blog on their Myspace page stating that ''[[Anyone for Doomsday?]]'' has officially been re-released. The legal battle ended and the album was released under the SKG Music License. The album is available on iTunes as a digital download. On April 21, 2009, the band released "V Is for Vampire", the second single from their album, which is planned for a summer release.

On October 1, 2009, the full track "Do Your Thing" was leaked onto YouTube. The song was apparently taken from the Megatronic Records Forum, which frontman [[Spider One]] currently owns. The CD ''Somewhere on the Other Side of Nowhere'' was officially released on October 6, 2009, in the U.S. and was available in Canada on October 20, 2009, two weeks after the reported release date. The band embarked on a national tour in support of the album.

On December 7, 2009, Spider, the band's lead singer posted links on his [[Twitter]] page linking to FearNET.com which is hosting the band's music video for their first single "Super Villain". The video is also available on YouTube and stars [[Johnathon Schaech]] as the infamous Super Villain.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/therealspider1 |title=Spider One (@therealSpider1) op Twitter |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2014-04-07 |access-date=2014-04-11}}</ref>

==Powerman 5000 in other media==
Various Powerman 5000 songs have been used in media, including television film soundtracks, and video games. This includes such game titles as ''[[FreQuency]]'', ''[[Shaun Palmer's Pro Snowboarder]]'', ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2004]]'', ''[[SX Superstar]]'', ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2]]'', ''[[Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)|Shadow the Hedgehog]]'', [[NHL Hitz 2003]], ''[[WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW]]'', ''[[Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec]]'' and [[WWE WrestleMania 21 (video game)|WWE WrestleMania 21]], along with the racing game ''[[Baja 1000]]; Score International''. Film soundtracks such as ''[[Dracula 2000]]'', ''[[Evolution (2001 film)|Evolution]]'', ''[[Blade II]]'', ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'', ''[[Titan AE]]'', ''[[Little Nicky]]'', ''[[Universal Soldier: The Return]]'', ''[[Zoolander]]'' and ''[[Bride of Chucky]]'' have all featured the work of Powerman 5000. The song "Bombshell" was also used extensively as the entrance music for the [[WWE]] tag team [[The Dudley Boyz]]. The game ''WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW'' featured three new songs from the band. Mr. Spider hoped the songs would gain popularity from the game alone, seeing the success of music through video games.<ref name="Taxi">{{cite web |url=http://www.taxi.com/transmitter/0411/headlineA0411.html |title=Spider One, Powerman 5000 & Megatronic Records |access-date=2009-05-07 |last=Genovese |first=Cathy |date=2001-01-11|publisher=Taxi.com}}</ref>
They were parodied in the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode "Missing Identity" as Stingray 5000; Patrick picks up an album by that band called "You Rock My Clams" and says "These guys rock!".
