In the Book of Ezekiel and (at least some) Christian icons, the cherub is depicted as having two pairs of wings, and four faces: that of a [[lion]] (representative of all [[wild animals]]), an [[ox]] ([[domestic animals]]), a [[human]] (humanity), and an [[eagle]] ([[bird]]s).<ref name="Wood2-4" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=What Is a Cherub?

Aside from Ezekiel's vision, no detailed attestations of ''cherubim'' survive, and Ezekiel's description of the [[tetramorph]] being may not be the same as the ''cherubim'' of the historic Israelites.<ref name="jstor">Eichler, Raanan. “Cherub: A History of Interpretation.” Biblica, vol. 96, no. 1, 2015, pp. 26–38., www.jstor.org/stable/43922717. Accessed 31 July 2021.</ref> All that can be gleaned about the ''cherubim'' of the Israelites come from potential equivalences in the cultures which surrounded them.

Delitzch (''Assyrisches Handwörterbuch'') connects the name ''keruv'' with Assyrian ''kirubu'' (a name of the ''shedu'')   and ''karabu'' ("great, mighty"). Karppe (1897) glosses Babylonian ''karâbu'' as "propitious" rather than "mighty".<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2">{{cite dictionary |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/4311-cherub |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |title=cherub |year=2002–2011 |orig-year=1906}}</ref><ref name="devaux2">De Vaux, Roland (tr.

Dhorme (1926) connected the Hebrew name to [[Akkadian language|Assyrian]] ''kāribu'' (diminutive ''kurību''), a term used to refer to intercessory beings (and statues of such beings) that plead with the gods on behalf of humanity.<ref name=":2">{{cite book |last=Wood |first=Alice |year=2008 |title=Of Wings and Wheels: A synthetic study of the Biblical cherubim |pages=3–4 |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |series=Beihefte Zur Zeitschrift fur die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft, Book&nbsp;385 |isbn=978-3110205282}}</ref> The folk etymological connection to a Hebrew word for "youthful" is due to [[Abbahu]] (3rd century).<ref name="Wood1"/> 

The Israelite cherubim are described as fulfilling a variety of functions - most often, they are described as bolstering the throne of [[Yahweh]]. Ezekiel's vision of the cherubim also emulate this, as the conjoined wingspan of the four cherubim are described as forming the boundary of the divine chariot. Likewise, on the so-called "[[mercy seat]]" of the [[Ark of the Covenant]], two cherubim are described as bounding the ark and forming a space through which Yahweh would appear – however, details about these cherubim aside from the instruction that they be beaten out of the sides of the ark are missing from the text. The status of the ''cherubim'' as constituting a sort-of vehicle for Yahweh is present in Ezekiel's visions, the [[Books of Samuel]],<ref>1 Samuel 4:4, 2 Samuel 6:2, 2 Samuel 22:11</ref> the parallel passages in the later [[Books of Chronicles]],<ref>1 Chronicles 13:6</ref> and passages in the early<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2" /> [[Psalms]]: for example, "and he rode upon a cherub and did fly: and he was seen upon the wings of the wind."<ref>2 Samuel 22:11</ref><ref>Psalms 18:10</ref> The traditional Hebrew conception of cherubim as guardians of the [[Garden of Eden]] is backed by the Semitic belief of beings of superhuman power and devoid of human feelings, whose duty it was to represent the gods, and as guardians of their sanctuaries to repel intruders; these conceptions in turn are similar to an account found on Tablet 9 of the inscriptions found at [[Nimrud]].<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2" /> 

[[File:Ivory plaque from Megiddo IAA 1938-780.jpg|thumb|right|An ivory from Tel Megiddo showing a king sitting on a throne which is supplicated by a sphinx-esque winged hybrid.]]
The appearance of the ''cherubim'' continue to be a subject of debate. [[Mythological hybrid]]s are common in the art of the [[Ancient Near East]]. One example is the Babylonian ''[[lamassu]]'' or ''shedu'', a protective spirit with a [[sphinx]]-like form, possessing the wings of an eagle, the body of a lion, and the head of a king. This was adopted largely in Phoenicia. The wings, because of their artistic beauty, soon became the most prominent part, and animals of various kinds were adorned with wings; consequently, wings were bestowed also upon man,<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2" /> thus forming the stereotypical image of an [[angel]].<ref name="wright2" /> [[William F. Albright]] (1938) argued that "the winged lion with human head" found in Phoenicia and Canaan from the Late Bronze Age is "much more common than any other winged creature, so much so that its identification with the cherub is certain".<ref name="Wood2-4"/> A possibly related source is the human-bodied [[Hittites|Hittite]] [[griffin]], which, unlike other griffins, appear almost always not as a fierce bird of prey, but seated in calm dignity, like an irresistible guardian of holy things;<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2" /><ref name="wright2" /> some have proposed that the  word ''griffin'' (γρύψ) may be cognate with ''cherubim''.<ref name="propp2">{{cite book |first=William H. |last=Propp |year=2006 |title=The Anchor Bible |volume=2A, Exodus&nbsp;19–40 |location=New York |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0-385-24693-5 |at=Exodus&nbsp;15:18, p.&nbsp;386, ''Notes''}} which references {{cite book |first=Julius |last=Wellhausen |author-link=Julius Wellhausen |year=1885 |title=[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels|Prolegomena to the History of Israel]] |page=304 |location=Edinburgh, Scotland |publisher=Black}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Robert S.

In particular resonance with the idea of cherubim embodying the throne of God, numerous pieces of art from Phoenicia, Egypt, and even [[Tel Megiddo#Megiddo ivories|Tel Megiddo]] in northern Israel depict kings or deities being carried on their thrones by hybrid winged-creatures.<ref name="wright2">Wright, G. Ernest, ''Biblical Archaeology'' (Philadelphia, Westminster Press, 1957)</ref> If this largely animal-esque appearance is how the ancient Israelites envisioned cherubim, it raises more questions than it answers. For one, it is difficult to visualize the cherubim of the Ark of the Covenant as quadrupedal creatures with backward-facing wings, as these cherubim were meant to face each other and have their wings meet, while still remaining on the edges of the cover, where they were beaten from. At the same time, these creatures have little-to-no resemblance to the ''cherubim'' in Ezekiel's vision. On the other hand, even if ''cherubim'' had a more humanoid form, this still would not entirely match Ezekiel's vision, and likewise seemingly clashes with the apparently equivalent archetypes of the cultures surrounding the Israelites, which almost uniformly depicted beings which served analogous purposes to Israel's ''cherubim'' as largely animalistic in shape. All of this may indicate that the Israelite idea of what a ''cherub'' looked like was subject to change, and perhaps not wholly consistent.<ref name="jstor" />

==Hebrew Bible==
{{see|Tetramorph|Living creatures (Bible)|Mercy seat|Ezekiel's cherub in Eden|Uriel}}
The cherubim are the most frequently occurring heavenly creature in the [[Hebrew Bible]], as the Hebrew word appears 91 times.<ref name="Wood2-4" /> The first occurrence is in the [[Book of Genesis]] 3:24. Despite these many references, the role of the cherubim is never explicitly elucidated.<ref name="Wood1" /> While Hebrew tradition must have conceived of the cherubim as guardians of the [[Garden of Eden]]<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2" /> (in which they guard the way to the [[Tree of life]]),<ref name="EDEN2">[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3:24&version=KJV Genesis 3:24 (King James Version)] at Bible Gateway.com</ref> they are often depicted as performing other roles; for example in the [[Book of Ezekiel]], they transport Yahweh's throne. The cherub who appears in the "Song of David", a poem which occurs twice in the Hebrew Bible, in [[books of Samuel|2 Samuel]] 22 and [[Psalms|Psalm]] 18, participates in Yahweh's [[theophany]] and is imagined as a vehicle upon which the deity descends to earth from heaven in order to rescue the speaker (see 2 Samuel 22:11, Psalm 18:10).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|pages=84–85}}</ref>
[[File:Cherub on a Neo-Assyrian seal.jpg|thumb|right|"Cherub" on a [[Neo-Assyrian]] seal, c. 1000–612 BC]]
In Exodus 25:18–22, God tells Moses to make multiple images of cherubim at specific points around the [[Ark of the Covenant]].<ref name="Wood2-4" /> Many appearances of the words ''cherub'' and ''cherubim'' in the Bible refer to the gold cherubim images on the [[mercy seat]] of the Ark, as well as images on the curtains of the [[Tabernacle]] and in [[Solomon's Temple]], including two measuring ten cubits high.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+kings%206:23-6:35&version=KJV|title=1 Kings 6:23–6:35 KJV – And within the oracle he made two|publisher=Bible Gateway|access-date=2012-12-30}}</ref>

In {{bibleref2|Isaiah|37:16|ESV}}, [[Hezekiah]] prays, addressing God as "enthroned above the cherubim" (referring to the [[mercy seat]]). In regard's to Solomon's Temple as described in 1 Kings, Eichler renders the phrase ''yoshev ha-keruvim''  as “who dwells among the cherubim”. This phrase is the same in 1 Kings and Isaiah. Eichler's interpretation in contrast to common translations for many years that rendered it as “who sits upon the cherubim”. This has implications for the understanding of whether the ark of the covenant in the Temple was literally YHWH's throne or simply an indicator of YHWH's immanence.<ref>Eichler, Raanan. "The Meaning of הַכְּרֻבׅים יֹשֵׁם." ''Zeitschrift Für Die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft'' 126 (2014): 358-371.  </ref> 

Cherubim feature at some length in the [[Book of Ezekiel]]. While they first appear in chapter one, in which they are transporting the throne of God by the river Chebar, they are not called ''cherubim'' until chapter 10.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|pages=94}}</ref> In Ezekiel 1:5–11 they are described as having the likeness of a man, and having four faces: that of a man, a lion (on the right side), and ox (on the left side), and an eagle. The four faces represent the four domains of God's rule: the man represents humanity; the lion, wild animals; the ox, domestic animals; and the eagle, birds.<ref name=":13">{{Cite book|title=Of Wings and Wheels: A Synthetic Study of the Biblical Cherubim|last=Wood|first=Alice|pages=137}}</ref> These faces peer out from the center of an array of four wings; these wings are joined to each other, two of these are stretched upward, and the other two cover their bodies. Under their wings are human hands; their legs are described as straight, and their feet like those of a calf, shining like polished brass. Between the creatures glowing coals that moved between them could be seen, their fire "went up and down", and lightning burst forth from it. The cherubs also moved like flashes of lightning.

In Ezekiel chapter 10, another full description of the cherubim appears with slight differences in details. Three of the four faces are the same – man, lion and eagle – but where chapter one has the face of an ox, Ezekiel 10:14 says "face of a cherub". Ezekiel equates the cherubim of chapter ten with the living creatures of chapter one: "They were the same creatures (חיה) I had seen by the river Chebar" (Ezekiel 10:15) and "These were the living creatures I had seen under the [[Yahweh|God of Israel]] on the banks of the river Chebar" (Ezekiel 10:20). In Ezekiel 41:18–20, they are portrayed as having two faces, although this is probably because they are depicted in profile.<ref name="Wood2-4" />

==In Judaism==
[[File:Tissot Moses and Joshua in the Tabernacle.jpg|thumb|''Moses and Joshua bowing before the Ark'' by [[James Tissot]] (c. 1900)]]
[[File:Ezekiel's vision.jpg|thumb|Ezekiel's "chariot vision" with the [[tetramorph]] ([[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]]), engraving after an illustration by [[Matthäus Merian]], ''Icones Biblicae'' (c. 1625–1630)]]
In rabbinic literature, the two ''cherubim'' are described as being human-like figures with wings, one a boy and the other a girl, placed on the opposite ends of the [[Mercy seat]] in the inner-sanctum of God's house.<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]] (''Sukkah'' 5b)</ref> [[Solomon's Temple]] was decorated with Cherubs according to 1 Kings 6, and [[Aha bar Jacob|Aḥa bar Ya’akov]] claimed this was true of the [[Second Temple]] as well.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Yoma 54a:17|url=https://www.sefaria.org/Yoma.54a.17|access-date=2021-02-19|website=www.sefaria.org}}</ref>

Many forms of [[Judaism]] include a belief in the existence of angels, including cherubim within the [[Jewish angelic hierarchy]]. The existence of angels is generally accepted within traditional [[rabbinic Judaism]]. There is, however, a wide range of beliefs within Judaism about what angels actually are and how literally one should interpret biblical passages associated with them.

In [[Kabbalah]] there has long been a strong belief in cherubim, the cherubim and other angels regarded as having mystical roles. The ''[[Zohar]]'', a highly significant collection of books in Jewish mysticism, states that the cherubim were led by one of their number named Kerubiel.<ref name="Jewish Encyclopedia2" />

On the other end of the philosophical spectrum is [[Maimonides]], who had a neo-Aristotelian interpretation of the Bible. Maimonides writes that to the wise man, one sees that what the Bible and Talmud refer to as "angels" are actually allusions to the various laws of nature; they are the principles by which the physical universe operates.{{quote|For all forces are angels! How blind, how perniciously blind are the naive?! If you told someone who purports to be a sage of Israel that the Deity sends an angel who enters a woman's womb and there forms an embryo, he would think this a miracle and accept it as a mark of the majesty and power of the Deity, despite the fact that he believes an angel to be a body of fire one third the size of the entire world. All this, he thinks, is possible for God. But if you tell him that God placed in the sperm the power of forming and demarcating these organs, and that ''this'' is the angel, or that all forms are produced by the Active Intellect; that here is the angel, the "vice-regent of the world" constantly mentioned by the sages, then he will recoil.– ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:4}}{{quote|For he [the naive person] does not understand that the true majesty and power are in the bringing into being of forces which are active in a thing although they cannot be perceived by the senses... Thus the Sages reveal to the aware that the imaginative faculty is also called an angel; and the mind is called a '''cherub'''. How beautiful this will appear to the sophisticated mind, and how disturbing to the primitive." – ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' II:6.}}[[Maimonides]] says that the figures of the cherubim were placed in the sanctuary only to preserve among the people the belief in angels, there being two in order that the people might not be led to believe that they were the image of God.<ref>''The Guide for the Perplexed'' III:45</ref>

Cherubim are discussed within the [[midrash]] literature. The two cherubim placed by [[God]] at the entrance of paradise (Gen. iii. 24) were angels created on the third day, and therefore they had no definite shape; appearing either as men or women, or as spirits or angelic beings (Genesis Rabbah xxi., end). The cherubim were the first objects created in the universe (Tanna debe Eliyahu R., i. beginning). The following sentence of the Midrash is characteristic: "When a man sleeps, the body tells to the neshamah (soul) what it has done during the day; the neshamah then reports it to the nefesh (spirit), the nefesh to the angel, the angel to the cherub, and the cherub to the seraph, who then brings it before God" (Leviticus Rabbah xxii.; Eccl. Rabbah x. 20).

In early Jewish tradition there existed the notion that cherubim had youthful, human features, due to the etymologization of the name by [[Abbahu]] (3rd century). Before this, some early midrashic literature conceived of the cherubim as non-corporeal.  In the first century AD, [[Josephus]] claimed: "No one can tell, or even conjecture, what was the shape of these Cherubim."(''Antiquities'':8:73).<ref name="Wood1" />

A midrash states that when Pharaoh pursued Israel at the Red Sea, God took a cherub from the wheels of His throne and flew to the spot, for God inspects the heavenly worlds while sitting on a cherub. The cherub, however, is "something not material," and is carried by God, not vice versa (Midr. Teh. xviii. 15; Canticles Rabbah i. 9).

In the passages of the [[Talmud]] that describe the heavens and their inhabitants, the seraphim, ofannim, and [[Living creatures (Bible)|living creatures]] are mentioned, but not the cherubim (Ḥag. 12b); and the ancient liturgy also mentions only these three classes.

In the [[Talmud]], [[Jose the Galilean]] holds<ref>[[Berakhot (Talmud)|Berakhot]] 49b</ref> that when the [[Birkat Hamazon]] (grace after meals) is recited by at least ten thousand seated at one meal, a special blessing, "Blessed is Ha-Shem our God, the God of Israel, [[Shekhinah|who dwells]] between the Cherubim," is added to [[Jewish prayer|the regular liturgy]].

In Medieval [[theology]], following the writings of [[Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite|Pseudo-Dionysius]], the cherubim are the second highest rank in the [[Christian angelic hierarchy|angelic hierarchy]], following the [[seraph]]im.<ref>"[http://www.esoteric.msu.edu/VolumeII/CelestialHierarchy.html Dionysius the Areopagite's Celestial Hierarchy]", Chapter VII</ref>

In Western art, cherubim became associated with the [[putto]] and the [[Greek mythology|Greco]]-[[Roman mythology|Roman]] [[Deity|god]] [[Cupid]]/[[Eros]], with depictions as small, plump, winged boys.<ref name="Wood1" />

Artistic representations of cherubim in Early Christian and [[Byzantine art]] sometimes diverged from scriptural descriptions.

[[Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi]] narrates about a [[fallen angel#Islam|fallen cherub]] encountered by Muhammad in the form of a snake. The snake tells him, that he did not performed ''[[dhikr]]'' (remembrance of God) for a moment, and so God was angry with him, cast him down to earth in the form of a snake. Then Muhammad went to [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]]. Together they interceded (Tawassul) for the angel and God restored him to his angelic form.<ref>https://www.ahlulbait.one/2020/07/07/die-cherubim-sind-anhaenger-der-reinen-leute-des-hauses/ (German)</ref> A similar story appears in ''Tabari's Bishara''. An angel called ''Futrus'', described as an "angel-cherub" (''malak al-karubiyyin''), was sent by God, but since the angel failed to complete his task in time, God broke one of his wings. Muhammad interceded for the cherub, and God forgives the fallen angel, whereupon he became the guardian for [[Hussain]]'s grave.<ref>Kohlberg, E. (2020). In Praise of the Few.
