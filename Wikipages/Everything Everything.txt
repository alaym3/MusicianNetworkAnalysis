==Career==
===Origins and early singles===
Three of the original band members are from [[Northumberland]], [[England]] - [[Jonathan Higgs]] (lead vocals, keyboards, laptop and guitar) grew up in the border village of [[Gilsland]] while Michael Spearman (drums, vocals) and [[Alex Niven (writer)|Alex Niven]] (guitars, vocals) are from [[Newbrough]]. The three met at [[Queen Elizabeth High School, Hexham|Queen Elizabeth High School]] in [[Hexham, Northumberland|Hexham]] where they played music together.<ref name="collectivereviewinterview2010">[http://thecollectivereview.com/von-von-lamunu/everything-everything-interview.html Everything Everything interview in ''The Collective Review''] by Von Von Lamunu, 16 June 2010</ref><ref name="haltwhistlejournal2009">{{cite news|title=Everything Everything's sounding great for Tynedale band|url=http://haltwhistle.journallive.co.uk/2009/05/everything-everythings-soundin.html|access-date=25 October 2012|newspaper=The Journal (Newcastle)|date=19 May 2009}}</ref> Higgs went on to study for a degree in Popular Music and Recording at [[Salford University]], where he met [[Kent]]-born bass player Jeremy Pritchard. Higgs and Pritchard decided to form a band once their degree had finished.<ref name="Guardian 3 bands in Manchester">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jan/22/manchester-egyptian-hip-hop|title=Manchester's music scene now has Everything Everything|last=Lester|first=Paul|date=21 January 2010|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fitzgerald|first=Todd|title=Salford University sings praises of graduates Everything Everything after album is chart hit|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/local-news/salford-university-sings-praises-of-graduates-1246615|access-date=8 April 2013|newspaper=Manchester Evening News|date=27 January 2013}}</ref> Initially they collaborated in the Salford-based [[math rock]] trio Modern Bison (with Higgs on drums, Pritchard on guitar and Sam Carswell on guitar and vocals), which released one album, ''I Could Have Had a Rustic Pagoda'' on unlabel in 2006.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Towards the end of 2006, Higgs and Niven devised plans to start a band "with a sort of [[Paul Morley]]-inspired, [[Rockism|poptimist]] aesthetic".<ref name="Review 31 interview">{{cite web|last=Cutterham|first=Tom|title=Politics beyond Dalston: An Interview with Alex Niven|url=http://review31.co.uk/interview/view/3/politics-beyond-dalston-an-interview-with-alex-niven|publisher=Review 31|access-date=13 April 2013}}</ref> Niven has described the band's naming process as follows: "The idea as I saw it was to try to take contemporary R&B pop music and fashion a vaguely Futurist project out of it, and between the two of us we chose the name Everything Everything, a [[détournement]] of sorts of an over-saturated media culture into something idealistic and expansive".<ref name="Review 31 interview" /> Ultimately the band took the name Everything Everything from the first two words of the [[Radiohead]] song "[[Everything In Its Right Place]]", the opening track to their album ''[[Kid A]]''.<ref name="independentinterview2017">{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/everything-everything-interview-band-a-fever-dream-new-album-a7887151.html|title=Everything Everything interview: On their new album A Fever Dream, personal lyrics, and Radiohead comparisons|last=Shepherd|first=Jack|date=14 August 2017|newspaper=The Independent|access-date=4 August 2020}}</ref> With the addition of Pritchard and Spearman, the band began performing in the autumn of 2007.<ref name="Review 31 interview" /> Pritchard recalls "we were initially more punky, with more guitars and no synths at all. It was easiest to play gigs like this and to get to grips with playing together. But the plan was always to expand the sound when we had the scope/could afford the gear!"<ref name="collectivereviewinterview2010"/>

Quickly gaining attention from the music industry, the band began working with producer [[David Kosten]] ([[Bat for Lashes]], Faultline). Everything Everything released their first single "Suffragette Suffragette" on 1 December 2008<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B001IEVK10 Everything Everything 'Suffragette Suffragette' - 7" Vinyl] [[Amazon.com]], Retrieved 12 October 2009.</ref> through [[XL Recordings]] offshoot Salvia as a limited 7" [[LP record|vinyl]] release only. This was later followed by the release of single "[[Photoshop Handsome]]", which saw the group incorporate synths in their sound for the first time, on 20 July 2009, available only as a limited 7" single.<ref name="Photoshop Handsome vinyl single">{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Everything-Everything-Photoshop-Handsome/release/1857307|title=Everything Everything – Photoshop Handsome|publisher=discogs.com|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> In autumn 2009, the band then released "[[My Kz, Ur Bf]]" as another vinyl-only release, this time with the record label Young & Lost Club.<ref>[http://www.normanrecords.com/vinyl/112415-everything-everything-my-kz-ur-bf/ Everything Everything 'MY KZ, UR BF' - Vinyl Release] Norman Records, Retrieved 5 August 2010.</ref> All three singles were released with accompanying music videos, with those for "Suffragette Suffragette" and "Photoshop Handsome" made entirely by the band themselves.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5h2LRvBQ5Q/ Everything Everything 'Photoshop Handsome' - Music Video] [[YouTube]], Retrieved 8 October 2010.</ref>

At this point, Niven left the band to pursue a career in academia<ref name="Review 31 interview" /> and was replaced by Guernsey-born guitarist Alex Robertshaw, whose former band [[Operahouse]] had split up a few months previously.<ref>{{cite web |title=Music Interview: Everything Everything |url=https://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/latest/music-interview-everything-everything-1-2254681 |website=Yorkshire Evening Post |access-date=26 July 2019}}</ref>

Everything Everything made the longlist of the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2010]] on 7 December 2009, a list created by Britain's tastemakers who vote for their favourite new artists.<ref name="BBC Sound of 2010">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8388573.stm|title=BBC Sound of 2010: Everything Everything|date=7 December 2009|work=bbc.co.uk|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref>

Not long after the nomination for BBC Sound of 2010, Everything Everything signed to the UK arm of [[Geffen Records]] before releasing the single "[[Schoolin']]" on 10 June 2010<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B003NU7JWG Everything Everything "Schoolin'"] Amazon.com, Retrieved 12 June 2010.</ref> as a [[CD single]], [[music download|digital download]] and also as a 7" vinyl. The single became the first to make an impact on the charts, debuting at number 152.

=== 2010–2012: ''Man Alive'' ===
The band's debut album ''[[Man Alive (Everything Everything album)|Man Alive]]'' (produced by David Kosten) was released on 30 August 2010 and was preceded by a [[reissue]] of the single "[[My Kz, Ur Bf]]" on 23 August 2010, debuting on the [[UK Singles Chart]] at number 121. The album was then released a week later, debuting on the [[UK Albums Chart]] at number 17.

''Man Alive'' received high critical praise from some reviewers, though others were critical. ''[[NME]]'' dubbed the band as "pop's new Picassos" and commented "there are three dirty words in indie right now: ambition, intellect and effort. Everything Everything don't just fit those terms, they pole-vault over them."<ref name="nmemanalivereview"/> ''BBC Music'' hailed the band's "brilliance" and noted "this Manchester quartet flee from any identikit indie clique, throwing ever-changing, protean sonic shapes... EE are wilfully eccentric, and endlessly entertaining, but they know more than most how to craft a song, how to make an album. They know how to give it depth, light and dark, and they – crucially – know when to stop."<ref name="bbcmanalivereview"/> ''[[Drowned in Sound]]'' praised the band's "sheer, rampant confidence" and described the album as containing "some pretty spiffy stuff...this is a band going places – they know it, and we know it."<ref name="dismanalivereview"/> Writing in ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'', Ian Cohen commented that the album was "proof that enthusiastic experimentation can't save your end product when the underlying elements are so incompatible and unappetizing" and criticized Higgs's "irritating voice".<ref name="Pitchfork Man Alive">{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=Ian|title=Man Alive (review)|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14611-man-alive/|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|access-date=13 April 2013}}</ref> On 19 July 2011 ''Man Alive'' was shortlisted for the 2011 [[Mercury Prize]], although it lost out to [[PJ Harvey]]'s ''[[Let England Shake]]''.

In May 2011, Everything Everything performed at [[Radio 1's Big Weekend]] in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/bigweekend/2011/lineup/|title=BBC - Radio 1's Big Weekend 2011 - Lineup|website=Bbc.co.uk|access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref> This was a gig close to home for Jonathan Higgs, who grew up in [[Gilsland]] only a few miles away. On 28 November 2011 (along with local Manchester musicians [[Badly Drawn Boy]] and [[I Am Kloot]]) Everything Everything performed as part of the Billie Butterfly charity concert, raising funds for American medical treatment for Billie Bainbridge, a local young girl diagnosed with a rare brain tumour.<ref name="TGTF Billie Butterfly show review">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregoesthefear.com/2011/12/live-review-magic-in-the-air-billie-butterfly-charity-show-at-manchester-comedy-store-28th-november-2011.php|title=Live Review: ‘Magic in the Air’ Billie Butterfly charity show at Manchester Comedy Store – 28th November 2011|last=Chang|first=Mary|date=13 December 2011|publisher=There Goes the Fear|access-date=12 August 2012}}</ref>

The band went on to support [[Snow Patrol]] in February 2012, and [[Muse (band)|Muse]] in November and December.

===2012–2014: ''Arc''===
In 2012, Everything Everything resumed work with David Kosten on sessions for their second album. The first single from the sessions was "[[Cough Cough]]", released on 28 August 2012: following which the band announced that their second album ''[[Arc (Everything Everything album)|Arc]]'' would be released in early 2013. New material from this album was performed in a UK tour spanning 13 September to 26 October 2012.

''Arc'' was released on 14 January 2013, and debuted at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart. Higgs noted that in comparison to the complexity of the songs on ''Man Alive'', the songwriting on ''Arc'' was intended to be a simpler distillation of his ideas and a more direct expression of his emotion. In an interview with the ''[[New Statesman]]'', he explained that the new album was "far more open. It's far less cluttered and far less difficult to work out what's going on or what I'm saying. I think we tried to straighten it out and make it less distracting and more solid and strong. There are fewer places to hide I think, so that's the main thing. It's clear now who's doing what. It took us a long time to be confident enough to do that."<ref name="newstatemaninterview2013">[http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/02/everything-everything-riots-were-kind-inevitable-if-you’ve-grown-16-absolutely-no-o "The riots were kind of inevitable… if you've grown up to 16 with absolutely no opportunities"] - interview with Jonathan Higgs in ''The New Statesman'' by Rob Pollard, 7 February 2013</ref>

The album was hailed as "another tour de force"<ref name="observerarcreview">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/13/everything-everything-arc-review Review of ''Arc'' in ''The Observer''] by Phil Mongredien, 13 January 2013</ref> by ''The Observer'', although ''The Guardian'' was more sparing with praise - "Jerky opener Cough Cough may showcase them at their most self-consciously wacky, but The Peaks is at the opposite end of the spectrum, attempting the kind of stadium melancholia beloved of [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] or [[Coldplay]]. Inevitably, ''Arc'' lacks coherence; it's the sound of a band working out who they want to be. Hopefully that'll be the band that combines both modes seamlessly, as they do on Kemosabe and Armourland, a sleek piece of robo-pop that links social breakdown with the emotional barriers we all put up.".<ref name="guardianarcreview">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jan/10/everything-everything-arc-review Review of ''Arc'' in ''The Guardian''] by Tim Jonze, 10 January 2013</ref>

''NME'' regarded the album as "a leaner, more relatable beast than its predecessor... The self-conscious straining to be regarded as innovators and iconoclasts that occasionally muddled their debut is absent here: this is a record less bothered about surface than it is about feeling... Slowly but surely, they are progressing towards something extraordinary." The review also called attention to the album's themes of technology and human response: "Pop's young futurists have written an album about how terrifying the future is. The intertwined themes of technology and disconnection are prevalent through ''Arc''."<ref>[http://www.nme.com/reviews/everything-everything/13952 Review of ''Arc'' in ''New Musical Express''] by Barry Nicolson, 8 January 2013</ref>

A third single from ''Arc'' – "Duet" – was released on 25 March 2013 on 7" vinyl.<ref name="duetrelease">{{cite web|url=http://www.everything-everything.co.uk/news/detail/pre-order-our-new-single-duet|title=Pre-order our new single "Duet"|publisher=everything-everything.co.uk|date=23 February 2013|access-date=27 February 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525054354/http://www.everything-everything.co.uk/news/detail/pre-order-our-new-single-duet|archive-date=25 May 2013}}</ref>

"[[Kemosabe (song)|Kemosabe]]" went on to be nominated as Best Contemporary Song at the 2014 [[Ivor Novello Awards]], and to win UK Single of the Year at the [[Music Producers Guild]] Awards.

===2015–2016: ''Get to Heaven''===
[[File:Everything Everything, Royal Albert Hall, London - Drew de F Fawkes 02.jpg|thumb|Higgs mid-performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London|alt=Lead vocalist, Jonathan Higgs, stands with a guitar in front of drummer, Michael Spearman, on a blue-lit stage.]]
On 17 February 2015, the band released the single "[[Distant Past (song)|Distant Past]]" with [[Zane Lowe]] on [[BBC Radio 1]] naming it the 'Hottest Record in the World'. The band's third studio album, ''[[Get to Heaven]]'', was released on 22 June 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/E_E_/status/598823120460521473|title=EverythingEverything on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=3 December 2015}}</ref> BBC Entertainment reporter Mark Savage said: "Ebola, missing airplanes, beheadings, the rise of UKIP. They're not the usual topics for a top 40 chart act, but that's exactly what alt-pop band Everything Everything have been writing about over the past year [...] The lyrics were inspired when the Manchester band took a year off from touring, and Higgs started watching rolling news on a loop". Higgs told Savage, "After we'd finished the record, I read the lyrics back and I realised I'd written a horror bible".<ref name="BBC News 18 June 2015">{{cite web |last=Savage |first=Mark |title= Everything Everything: 'Our album is a horror bible'|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-33153655| date=18 June 2015|website= [[BBC News Online]] | access-date=18 June 2015}}</ref>

The video for the band's single 'Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread' was shared on 31 July 2015. The video sees the band's frontman Jonathan Higgs take over production. He said via a press release, "The song talks about seasons passing and getting older, so we wanted to concentrate on the Sun and make it into a kind of oppressive force – positive and life-giving but also burning and destructive. We used Ultra-Violet and Infra-Red cameras to get a look at the sun damage on our skin, and give everything an alien look. We shot in a quarry so we could have a clear horizon and a dry, hot, desert scene. Most of the sun effects were completed afterwards because we picked a rainy day to shoot, though we did spray everything silver in order to get some good light reflections and add to the heatproof/astronaut feel."<ref name="Never Enough Notes">{{cite news|title = Everything Everything share their new video for 'Spring / Sun / Winter / Dread'|url = http://nenot.es/1KLye3O|work = Never Enough Notes|issue = Never Enough Notes|date = 3 August 2015|ref = Never Enough Notes}}</ref>

On 2 September 2016, Everything Everything released the single "I Believe It Now" for [[BT Sport]] to use for [[Premier League]] shows. They also announced they were working on a fourth album, with Higgs commenting that its lyrics would "inevitably" be affected by [[Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Everything Everything interview: 4th album will "almost unavoidably" be affected by Brexit|url=http://theunapologists.com/everything-everything-interview-brexit-new-album|access-date=3 December 2016|work=The Unapologists|date=21 November 2016}}</ref>

On 13 June 2017, Everything Everything announced their fourth album ''[[A Fever Dream]]'' by releasing the single "Can't Do".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/everything-everything-unveil-video-new-single-cant-2088469|title=Everything Everything announce new album and unveil video for new single 'Can't Do' {{!}} NME|date=2017-06-14|website=NME|language=en-GB|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> The album was later released on 18 August 2017<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/nz/album/a-fever-dream/id1245331144|title=A Fever Dream by Everything Everything on Apple Music|date=18 August 2017|website=Itunes.apple.com|access-date=1 October 2017}}</ref> to strong reviews, with ''The Guardian'' declaring "if pop culture continues on its dorky course, it will be only a matter of time before these nerds rule."<ref>{{Cite news|last=Aroesti|first=Rachel|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/aug/17/everything-everything-a-fever-dream-review-sony|title=Everything Everything: A Fever Dream review – nerdish pop for a troubled planet|date=2017-08-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-04-21|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Marcy Donelson of AllMusic wrote: "A Fever Dream is confrontational, warped, emotionally and aurally high-contrast, and full of turmoil, but reliable in its infectiousness."<ref>{{Citation|title=A Fever Dream - Everything Everything {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits {{!}} AllMusic|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/a-fever-dream-mw0003079256|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> The album also received commercial success, peaking at number 5 on the UK Albums Chart.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/charts/albums-chart/20170825/7502/|title=Official Albums Chart Top 100 {{!}} Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Following the success of the album, the band went on tour in spring 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gigsandtours.com/news/everything-everything-spring-2018-tour/3023|title=Gigs And Tours News|website=Gigs and Tours|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Speaking to ''[[The Independent]]'', Higgs says "The lyrics are definitely more personal here, [...] You can't always be talking about the bigger things, you sometimes need to talk about what's close to you."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/everything-everything-interview-band-a-fever-dream-new-album-a7887151.html|title=Everything Everything on their new album and Radiohead comparisons|date=2017-08-14|website=The Independent|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>

==Musical style==
Everything Everything are noted for an extremely eclectic and dynamic style, with complex song construction and dense, detailed lyrics sung in [[falsetto]] by Jonathan Higgs. While nominally an alternative rock band with outright pop stylings, the band uses production and rhythmic approaches closer to those of [[contemporary R&B]], [[glitch pop]] and [[electronica]] (including heavy use of laptop programming and processing) and songwriting approaches similar to those of [[progressive rock|progressive]] or [[psychedelic rock]].<ref name="bbcmanalivereview" /> Critic Paul Lester has compared Everything Everything's sound to "a riot in a melody factory"<ref name="bbcarcreview">[https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/4gcg BBC Music review of 'Arc'] by Paul Lester, 4 January 2013</ref> and compared them to "[[Timbaland]] if he cocked an oblique ear to [[Yes (band)|Yes]]".<ref name="bbcarcreview" /> In the Guardian, Mark Beaumont described the band as "the most intricate, streamlined merging yet of [[math rock]]'s arch complexities, electronica's 80s obsession and hooks made from mobile phone interference."<ref name="guardianlive2012">[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/24/everything-everything-review Live review of Everything Everything at Village Underground, London], by Mark Beaumont in ''[[The Guardian]]'', 24 October 2012</ref>

When asked about their sound in an interview with UK music blog ''There Goes the Fear'' in Leeds in October 2010, singer Jonathan Higgs replied, "We think of it as rock primarily. We try not to make it sound like a lot of things you’ve heard before, not on purpose, but it tends to come out a bit like that. We’re not really interested in copying certain genres or anything, so I guess you’d say it’s unpredictable and sort of surprising."<ref name="TGTF interview October 2010">{{cite web|url=http://www.theregoesthefear.com/2010/10/interview-jonathan-higgs-of-everything-everything.php|title=Interview: Jonathan Higgs of Everything Everything|last=Morton|first=Luke|date=15 October 2010|publisher=There Goes the Fear|access-date=13 August 2012}}</ref> Higgs has counted [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Radiohead]], [[the Beatles]], [[Destiny's Child]], and [[R. Kelly]] as some of the band's very eclectic stock of influences.<ref name="TGTF interview October 2010" />

Bassist Jeremy Pritchard has said the band's intention is "to avoid cliche, or the cliches expected of white men with guitars from Manchester" and sums up their sound as "highly stylised and deracinated – we're influenced by everything except 12-bar blues."<ref name="Guardian 3 bands in Manchester" /> He's also commented "There are no genres I can think of that we haven’t learnt something from. We all share a huge number of basic passions like Radiohead, but we all come from different areas of popular music: [[jazz]] and [[funk]]; modern US R'n'B, prog and [[krautrock]], post-rock/punk/hardcore. And we all love good honest pop. We’re a rock band as far as we're concerned."<ref name="collectivereviewinterview2010" /> He's noted that the band's lyrics are "almost always layered with several meanings, and play with puns, quotes or alliteration a fair amount, but never just for the sake of it."<ref name="collectivereviewinterview2010" />

In an interview with the ''Irish Times'', drummer Michael Spearman said "It sounds quite cheesy, but stuff like Destiny’s Child has proven just as important as The Beatles and Radiohead. I suppose that love of R'n'B comes through in a way. We don't normally say 'we want this song to sound like this or that', we try to be as organic as possible. It's like with The Beatles – they were trying to play the black music of the day, and by doing so, they sort of changed it, it became a different thing. We thought about... trying to get Timbaland in, or something. But we decided against it, because it's a fine line between filtering that music, or just trying to ape it by going to the source of it... We all love [[Michael Jackson]] and stuff like that; dance music in general, or just that sort of syncopated music. That's something that connects all of us."<ref name="irishtimes2010">{{cite news | url=http://laurenmurphy.wordpress.com/2010/09/02/everything-everything-nothing-wanting/ | title=Everything Everything: Nothing Wanting | newspaper=Irish Times | first=Lauren | last=Murphy | date=20 August 2010 | via=''The World Won't Listen'' blog}}</ref>
