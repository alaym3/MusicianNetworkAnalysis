==Adult career==
While already a music business veteran, in the early 1990s, Costa transitioned away from childhood [[Pop music|pop]] to mature [[Soul music|soul]]. She married Australian producer/songwriter [[Justin Stanley]] and moved to his country. (Costa and Stanley now have a daughter named Sugar McQueen.) While in Australia, Costa began writing her own songs and formed a "happy funk" band called Little Mona & the Shag Daddies, which broke up after four gigs in [[Sydney]]. Costa's next venture was a band called Sugarbone, which toured Australia in 1994. Costa describes the experience as "It was really scary to unveil it, but the reaction was good. It helped my confidence."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2001/08/20/hotstar29849.aspx |title=Nikka.Costa |publisher=Pollstar |access-date=8 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223150639/http://www.pollstar.com/blogs/hotstar/archive_/2001/08/20/hotstar29849.aspx |archive-date=23 February 2012 }}</ref> After Sugarbone, she signed to the Mushroom label in Australia.
