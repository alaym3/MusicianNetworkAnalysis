==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Lanois was born in [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]], [[Quebec]].<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=734}}</ref> Lanois started his production career when he was 17<ref>"[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/daniel-lanois/ Lanois, Daniel]". The Canadian Encyclopedia. Retrieved 2011-29-06.</ref> recording local artists including [[Simply Saucer]] with his brother [[Bob Lanois]] in a studio in the basement of their mother's home in [[Ancaster, Ontario]]. Later, Lanois started Grant Avenue Studios in an old house which he purchased in [[Hamilton, Ontario]].<ref name="Lanois">{{cite web| title = Grant Avenue Studios/ Daniel Lanois| url=http://www.grantavestudio.com| access-date = 2007-01-24}}</ref> He worked with a number of local bands, including [[Martha and the Muffins]] (for whom his sister [[Jocelyne Lanois|Jocelyne]] played bass), [[Ray Materick]], [[Spoons (band)|Spoons]], and the Canadian children's singer [[Raffi Cavoukian|Raffi]]. Lanois attended Ancaster High School.

=== Producer ===
In 1981 Lanois played on and produced the album ''[[This Is the Ice Age]]'' by [[Martha and the Muffins]]. In 1985 he and two members of the band earned a [[CASBY Awards|CASBY award]] for their work on the band's (by then going by "M + M") 1984 album ''[[Mystery Walk]]''.<ref name="Inc.1985">{{cite magazine|author=Kirk LaPointe|title=CASBY Awards: The people speak|magazine=Billboard|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PT74|date=11 May 1985|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|pages=74–|issn=0006-2510}}</ref>

Lanois worked collaboratively with [[Brian Eno]] on some of Eno's own projects, one of which was the "Prophecy Theme" for David Lynch's [[Dune (1984 film)|film adaptation]] of Frank Herbert's ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]''. Eno invited him to co-produce U2's album ''[[The Unforgettable Fire]]''.  Along with Eno, he went on to produce U2's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', the 1987 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year]] winner, and some of the band's other works including ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' and ''[[All That You Can't Leave Behind]]'', both of which were nominated for the same award but did not win. Lanois once again collaborated with U2 and Brian Eno on the band's 2009 album, ''[[No Line on the Horizon]]''. He was involved in the songwriting process as well as mixing and production.<ref name="No Line U2">

Lanois' early work with U2 led to him being hired to produce albums for other top-selling artists. He collaborated with [[Peter Gabriel]] on his album ''[[Birdy (Peter Gabriel album)|Birdy]]'' (1985), the soundtrack to [[Alan Parker]]'s [[Birdy (film)|film of the same name]], and then spent most of 1985 co-producing Gabriel's album [[So (album)|''So'']]. The album was released in 1986 and became his best-selling release, earning [[multi-platinum]] sales and a Grammy nomination for Album of the Year. Lanois later co-produced Gabriel's follow-up, ''[[Us (Peter Gabriel album)|Us]]'' which was released in 1992 and also went platinum.

[[Bono]] recommended Lanois to [[Bob Dylan]] in the late 1980s; in 1989 Lanois produced Dylan's ''[[Oh Mercy]]''. Eight years later, Dylan and Lanois worked together on ''[[Time Out of Mind (Bob Dylan album)|Time Out of Mind]]'', which won another Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997. In his autobiographical ''[[Chronicles, Vol. 1]]'', Dylan describes in depth the contentious but rewarding working relationship he developed with Lanois.<ref name="chronicles">

=== Recording artist ===
As well as being a producer, Lanois is a songwriter, musician and recording artist. He has released several solo albums and film scores; his first album, ''[[Acadie (album)|Acadie]]'' was released in 1989.<ref name="Larkin"/><ref>[http://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/17548/cohen-gould-buffy-25-best-canadian-debut-albums "25 best Canadian debut albums ever"]. ''CBC Music'', June 16, 2017.</ref> A number of Lanois' songs have been covered by other artists, including [[Dave Matthews]], [[Jerry Garcia Band]], [[Willie Nelson]], [[The Tea Party (band)|Tea Party]], Anna Beljin, [[Isabelle Boulay]], and [[Emmylou Harris]]. His albums have had some success, particularly in Canada. Lanois plays the guitar, [[pedal steel]], and drums. ''[[Belladonna (album)|Belladonna]]'', an instrumental album released in 2005 was nominated for a [[Grammy]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/08/arts/the-complete-list-of-grammy-nominations.html|title=The Complete List of Grammy Nominations|date=December 8, 2005|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

Lanois' song "Sonho Dourado" was included in the 2004 [[Billy Bob Thornton]] film, ''[[Friday Night Lights (film)|Friday Night Lights]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390022/soundtrack|title=Friday Night Lights (2004) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> In 2005 with the re-release of his first solo album, Acadie, a late-1980s version of the song appears on the additional tracks called "Early Dourado Sketch". Lanois had performed the song numerous times in the intervening years, including on a Toronto television program in 1993 where it was credited as "Irish Melody" on a recording of the performance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amoeba.com/cool-water-cd-daniel-lanois/albums/671368/|title=Cool Water (CD)|website=Amoeba.com|access-date=April 8, 2020}}</ref> Though the melody does indeed feel Irish, the title is Portuguese and means ''golden dream''.
Lanois also provided an instrumental score for ''LOUDquietLOUD'', a 2006 documentary about the [[Pixies (band)|Pixies]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/29/movies/29loud.html|title=loudQUIETloud: A Film About the Pixies - Review - Movies|first=Nathan|last=Lee|date=September 29, 2006|website=Nytimes.com}}</ref>

Lanois premiered a documentary entitled ''Here Is What Is'' at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2007. The film chronicles the recording of his album of the same name and includes footage of the actual recording. The album ''[[Here Is What Is]]'' was released, first by download, then on compact disc, in late 2007 and early 2008. Soon after that, Lanois released a three-disc recording called ''Omni''.

In October 2009, Lanois started a project called Black Dub which features Lanois on guitar, [[Brian Blade]] on drums, and [[Daryl Johnson (musician)|Daryl Johnson]] on bass, along with multi-instrumentalist/singer [[Trixie Whitley]].
