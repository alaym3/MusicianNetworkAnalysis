'''Blind Melon''' is an American [[Rock music|rock]] band formed in 1990 in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], by five musicians: three from [[Mississippi]], one from [[Pennsylvania]] and one from [[Indiana]]. The band currently consists of guitarists [[Rogers Stevens]] and Christopher Thorn, drummer Glen Graham, vocalist Travis Warren and bassist Nathan Towne. They are best known for their 1993 hit "[[No Rain]]", and enjoyed critical and commercial success in the early 1990s with their [[neo-psychedelia|neo-psychedelic]] take on [[alternative rock]].

Blind Melon released two albums on [[Capitol Records]] – ''[[Blind Melon (album)|Blind Melon]]'' (1992) and ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]'' (1995) – before their original lead vocalist [[Shannon Hoon]] died of a [[drug overdose]] on the band's tour bus in New Orleans on October 21, 1995. After four years of unsuccessfully searching for a replacement for Hoon, Blind Melon officially dissolved in 1999.<ref name=bm>{{cite news|title=Blind Melon Official Website|website=blindmelon.com|url=http://www.blindmelon.com/biography/|access-date=September 24, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190329150339/http://www.blindmelon.com/biography/|archive-date=March 29, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> The remaining members reformed the band in 2006 with Warren and recorded one album with him, ''[[For My Friends]]'' (2008).

==History==

===Formation, debut and success (1990–1993)===
Blind Melon formed in Los Angeles in March 1990 after [[West Point, Mississippi]], transplants [[Rogers Stevens]] and Brad Smith, a guitarist and bassist respectively, met vocalist [[Shannon Hoon]], a native of [[Lafayette, Indiana]].<ref name=rs>{{cite magazine|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/34.htm|title=Organically Grown|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=October 1, 1992|access-date=August 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610093154/http://blindmelon.org/articles/34.htm|archive-date=June 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Guitarist Christopher Thorn, originally from [[Pennsylvania]], was added shortly thereafter; the four eventually convinced drummer Glen Graham to relocate from Mississippi to complete the group after failing to find a drummer in Los Angeles.<ref name=rs />  Their moniker derived from a nickname Smith had observed among Mississippi hippies,<ref name=nytobit>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/22/obituaries/shannon-hoon-the-lead-singer-of-blind-melon-is-dead-at-28.html|title=Shannon Hoon, the Lead Singer Of Blind Melon, Is Dead at 28|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 22, 1995|access-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> a name with precedent in the 1920s [[blues]] artist [[Blind Lemon Jefferson]] and the [[Cheech & Chong]] character Blind Melon Chitlin'.

The band debuted with a four-song demo, ''The Goodfoot Workshop'', in 1991. [[Capitol Records]] A&R executive [[Tim Devine]] signed Blind Melon later that year and oversaw sessions with famed producer [[David Briggs (record producer)|David Briggs]] for an unreleased EP to be titled ''The Sippin' Time Sessions''.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Adelson|first1=David|title=Who's Responsible for Blind Melon Bearing Fruit?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-09-05/entertainment/ca-31807_1_blind-melon-s-success|access-date=24 April 2015|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=September 5, 1993}}</ref>  The recordings were abandoned due to the band's dissatisfaction with the production quality, which they felt resulted in "slick and doctored" results.<ref name="Prato">{{cite magazine|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=blind melon|bio=true}}|title=Blind Melon Biography|magazine=Billboard|first=Greg|last=Prato|access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref> Hoon's friendship and association with [[Guns N' Roses]] frontman [[Axl Rose]] accrued additional industry attention for the group, as he provided backing vocals on several Guns N' Roses tracks on 1991's ''[[Use Your Illusion I]]'' and ''[[Use Your Illusion II|II]]'' albums, including the single "[[Don't Cry]]".  Blind Melon embarked upon a tour supporting [[Soundgarden]] late that year.<ref name=rstwo>{{cite magazine|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/37.htm|title=Knee Deep in the Hoopla|magazine=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=November 11, 1993|access-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610104040/http://blindmelon.org/articles/37.htm|archive-date=June 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

At Capitol's suggestion,<ref name="Currin">{{cite news|url=http://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/a-reunited-blind-melon-reminisces-about-its-time-in-durham/Content?oid=1205400|title=A reunited Blind Melon reminisces about its time in Durham|newspaper=[[Indy Week]]|first=Grayson|last=Currin|date=2007-11-28|access-date=2011-05-14}}</ref> the band relocated to [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], while beginning work on what would become their [[Blind Melon (album)|self-titled debut album]] with producer [[Rick Parashar]], known for producing [[Pearl Jam]]'s ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''.<ref name=rs />  Sessions were held in [[London Bridge Studio]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and the album was recorded mostly live with minimal overdubs.<ref name=rs /> The record was released in September 1992, and initially sold poorly behind its lead singles, "[[Tones of Home]]" and "[[No Rain]]", until the latter became an MTV staple the following July. Promoted by a successful [[music video]] featuring [[Heather DeLoach]] playing the "Bee Girl", "No Rain" helped the band achieve international recognition.  The album eventually attained quadruple-[[RIAA certification|platinum]] status, debuting in the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' top 40 on October 9, 1993, and peaking at No.&nbsp;11 on the Hot 100.

===''Soup'' and Hoon's death (1993–1995)===
The group toured extensively in support of their debut, performing dates in Europe and Mexico and supporting such acts as [[Neil Young]] and [[Lenny Kravitz]] late in 1993.<ref name=rstwo /><ref name=creem>{{cite magazine|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/38.htm|title=Rapping with Blind Melon|magazine=[[Creem Magazine]]|date=October 27, 1993|access-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430190935/http://www.blindmelon.org/articles/38.htm|archive-date=April 30, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>  Their activity the following year included a performance at [[Woodstock '94]] in August and a supporting slot on the [[Rolling Stones]]' [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] thereafter.  Amidst rising success, the band began to experience personal and legal problems related to drug and alcohol abuse,<ref name=nytobit /><ref name=rstwo /> leading to multiple stints in drug rehabilitation for Hoon.<ref name=rsthree>{{cite magazine|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/36.htm|title=Shannon Hoon 1967–1995|magazine=[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]|date=November 30, 1995|access-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716033513/http://blindmelon.org/articles/36.htm|archive-date=July 16, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1994, the members relocated to [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]],<ref name=rsthree /> to begin work on their second album, ''[[Soup (Blind Melon album)|Soup]]'', with producer [[Andy Wallace (producer)|Andy Wallace]].  The album was released in 1995, and predominantly featured shorter songs with a less conventional alternative rock approach, including [[Dixieland|New Orleans-style jazz]] and a hodgepodge of instrumentation throughout, such as horn sections and mandolin/banjo tracks. The lyrics to "St. Andrew's Fall" referenced a suicide jump, "Skinned" spoke about the life of a serial killer, and "New Life" addressed the forthcoming birth of Hoon's child. "Mouthful of Cavities" featured backing vocals from Jena Kraus, who subsequently recorded a solo record with Thorn and Smith.  Despite the debut of the lead single, "[[Galaxie (song)|Galaxie]]", at number 25 on the ''Billboard'' charts,<ref name=bbg>{{cite magazine|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/44.htm|title=The Modern Age|magazine=Billboard|date=August 12, 1995|access-date=August 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716033544/http://blindmelon.org/articles/44.htm|archive-date=July 16, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> ''Soup'' ultimately failed to meet sales expectations.<ref name=rsthree />

Later that year, Blind Melon contributed a version of the song "[[Out on the Tiles]]" to the ''[[Encomium: A Tribute to Led Zeppelin|Encomium]]'' tribute album to [[Led Zeppelin]], and cover of the ''[[Schoolhouse Rock!]]'' song "Three Is a Magic Number" to the ''[[Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks]]'' compilation.  Their version of "Three Is a Magic Number", although never a charting single, became a fan favorite and featured in the films ''[[Never Been Kissed]]'', ''[[Slackers (film)|Slackers]]'', and ''[[You, Me and Dupree]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/three-is-a-magic-number-t8978733 |title=Three Is a Magic Number |website=AllMusic |access-date=2012-05-03}}</ref> [[All Music Guide]] reviewer Theresa E.

Against the advice of Hoon's drug counselor,<ref name=rsthree /> Blind Melon went on tour in support of ''Soup''.  The band initially employed a counselor to assist Hoon's rehabilitation, but this attendant was soon dismissed.<ref name=rsthree />  After several weeks on the road, Hoon was found dead on the band's tour bus of a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] caused by a cocaine overdose,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6737381/blind-melon-shannon-hoon-death|title = Blind Melon Singer Shannon Hoon Died 20 Years Ago Today: Rewinding the News|magazine = [[Billboard (magazine)]]|date = 21 October 2015}}</ref> on October 21, 1995, in downtown New Orleans.<ref name=rsthree />

===Aftermath and breakup (1995–1999)===
The surviving members opted to continue their collaboration and recruit a new vocalist,<ref name=csm>{{cite news|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/45.htm|title=A Musical Generation Explores how to Cope with the Consequences of Drugs|newspaper=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]|date=February 19, 1997|access-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716033549/http://blindmelon.org/articles/45.htm|archive-date=July 16, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> although it would ultimately take them over a decade to do so.  In 1996, they issued ''[[Nico (album)|Nico]]'', an album of outtakes and demos named for Hoon's daughter, who was only 13 weeks old when her father died.  ''Nico'' contained unreleased songs from the ''Soup'' recording sessions, as well as several songs recorded with only partial instrumentation.  The closing track, "Letters from a Porcupine", was recorded as a telephone message left by Hoon on Thorn's answering machine. The album also included covers of [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] and [[John Lennon]] songs.  Its profits went to a program that helps musicians with drug and alcohol addiction.<ref name=csm />

Discussing his loss with ''[[The Guardian]]'', Gia DeSantis, former [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]] DJ, producer and host at [[KDOC-TV|KDOC]] and head of video promotion at Capitol Records who worked with the band, said "Shannon had a magnetism. You couldn't take your eyes off him. They knew to bring in a new singer to sing his lyrics would not have had the same magnetism." She also mentions that "the band knew its chapter was closed following Hoon's death because he had become the public face of their music through their videos, particularly the one for No Rain" a video that made VH1's list of Top 100 Music Videos of All Time.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/05/how-bands-survive-losing-singer-scott-weiland-stone-temple-pilots-velvet-revolver|title=How bands survive the loss of a singer: 'It can't just be slotting someone in'|last=Guarino|first=Mark|date=2015-12-05|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077|access-date=2016-12-15}}</ref>

During this period, the relationships between the band members disintegrated as they attempted to recruit a new front man.<ref name=beac>{{cite news|url=http://blindmelon.org/articles/3.htm|title=Blind Melon Moves On|newspaper=Daily Beacon|date=February 13, 1997|access-date=August 13, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090716033503/http://blindmelon.org/articles/3.htm|archive-date=July 16, 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After failing to find a replacement for Hoon, Blind Melon officially dissolved their partnership on March 4, 1999, and the various members went on to other projects, including Thorn and Smith's activity in [[Unified Theory (band)|Unified Theory]], a group they had founded the previous year.

===Inactivity (1999–2006)===
[[Image:Blind melon.jpg|right|thumb|Blind Melon live in New York, 2008 (L–R: Christopher Thorn, Brad Smith, Travis Warren, Rogers Stevens)]]
In 2002, Capitol Records released a ''Classic Masters'' CD showcasing twelve Blind Melon songs. Thanks to stronger-than-expected sales, the band released ''[[The Best of Blind Melon]]'' in 2005, a CD–DVD package that features Blind Melon performing live from a September 1995 concert in [[Chicago]]. On December 15, 2006, a [[tribute album]] to Blind Melon was released by Yakmusic in [[New Zealand]] featuring bands from all over the world. In April 2006, Capitol Records released the ''[[Live at the Palace]]'' CD.

===Reunion and ''For My Friends'' (2006–2008)===
Blind Melon announced their reformation on September 15, 2006, which included the addition of new lead singer Travis Warren (formerly of Rain Fur Rent).<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/56893/blind-melon-recording-album-with-new-singer Blind Melon Recording Album With New Singer], ''billboard.com'', October 20, 2006, Retrieved March 16, 2006.</ref>  Three new Blind Melon songs – "Make a Difference", "For My Friends" and "Harmful Belly" – followed on November 9.  On October 7, 2007, they performed their first live concert in twelve years in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].

"Wishing Well", the first single from the group's upcoming third studio album, was released on March 4, 2008, to coincide with a U.S. tour.  The album, ''[[For My Friends]]'', was released on April 22, 2008, on Adrenaline Records.<ref>{{cite news|first=Larry |last=London |title=Blind Melon Releases New Album 'For My Friends' |date=7 July 2008 |publisher=Voice of America |url=http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-07/2008-07-07-voa30.cfm |work=VOA News |access-date=3 January 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217022210/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2008-07/2008-07-07-voa30.cfm |archive-date=December 17, 2008 }}</ref> On September 17, 2008, the biography ''A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon'' by Greg Prato was published.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Devil on One Shoulder and an Angel on the Other: The Story of Shannon Hoon and Blind Melon (9780615252391): Greg Prato: Books |isbn=978-0615252391 |last1=Prato |first1=Greg |date=September 2008 }}</ref>  European tour dates followed thereafter.

However, this was later retracted, and the tour cancelled.

===Second reformation and new album (2010–present)===
On November 2, 2010, Blind Melon announced its reformation and Warren's return.<ref name=ct>{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-09-02/entertainment/ct-ott-0902-blind-melon-20110902_1_rogers-stevens-shannon-hoon-christopher-thorn|title=Blind Melon interview|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=September 2, 2011|access-date=August 13, 2012}}</ref>  Their first performance came November 27, when they played a free concert at the base of [[Aspen Mountain (Colorado)|Aspen Mountain]] in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. They continued sporadic performances over the coming months, opening for [[Candlebox]] at The Hard Rock Hotel in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], on February 4, 2011, and headlining Rest Fest at Crumland Farms, [[Frederick, Maryland]], on September 5.

In 2012 they toured South America, with dates in Chile and Argentina, and Western Europe thereafter. On the status of the group, Graham stated late that year that "Blind Melon is still a functioning entity; Travis Warren is our current vocalist as he has been since 2007; however, we are only doing the occasional one-off and currently have no plans to record full length CDs."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://glengraham.net/|title=I Want To Be Your Drummer |author=Glenn Graham |date=December 1, 2012|access-date=December 1, 2012}}</ref>

To cap 2015, the band played back-to-back shows on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day at Lafayette Theater in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], with Shannon Hoon's mother present. Nico Blue, Hoon's daughter, took the stage to sing the song "Change."

By 2018, Blind Melon had spent the last couple years working on new material for the follow-up to ''[[For My Friends]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/brad_smith_of_blind_melon/|title=Brad Smith of Blind Melon : Songwriter Interviews|publisher=songfacts.com|date=April 18, 2013|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://rjmattice.wordpress.com/2013/11/21/blind-melons-travis-warren-talks-performance-for-shannon-hoon-vigilstock/|title=Blind Melon's Travis Warren talks performance for Shannon Hoon Vigilstock|publisher=rjmattice.wordpress.com|date=November 21, 2013|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://maytherockbewithyou.com/mtrbwy/2015/10/christopher-thorn-of-blind-melon/|title=Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon|publisher=maytherockbewithyou.com|date=October 9, 2015|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coverageopinions.info/Vol6Issue8/Declarations.html|title=Declarations: The Coverage Opinions Interview With Rogers Stevens|publisher=Coverage Opinions |date=October 11, 2017|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://lipulse.com/2018/04/18/blind-melon-tour-and-new-music-interview/|title=Blind Melon Predicts No Rain in NYC|magazine=Long Island Pulse Magazine |date=April 18, 2018|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref> In a July 2018 interview on [[Consequence of Sound]]'s "Kyle Meredith With&nbsp;..." podcast, guitarist Christopher Thorn stated, "I've been mixing the new single or the new song, I could say&nbsp;... the new song for the next Blind Melon record.

''For sure''.”<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prato|first1=Greg|title=Blind Melon: "We're releasing 10-12 singles instead of an album all at once – we'd rather remind people we exist every couple of months than every 2 years"|url=https://www.guitarworld.com/features/blind-melon-were-releasing-10-12-singles-instead-of-an-album-all-at-once-wed-rather-remind-people-we-exist-every-couple-of-months-than-every-2-years|access-date=11 February 2021|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=11 February 2021}}</ref>
