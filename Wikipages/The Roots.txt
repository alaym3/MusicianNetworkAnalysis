'''The Roots''' are an American [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] band formed in 1987 by [[Black Thought|Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter]] and [[Questlove|Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], United States. The Roots serve as the [[house band]] on [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'', having served in the same role on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' from 2009 to 2014.

The Roots are known for a jazzy and eclectic approach to hip-hop featuring live musical instruments<ref name="IH_Review">{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theroots/albums/album/111873/review/5946009/illadelph_halflife|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506052925/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/theroots/albums/album/111873/review/5946009/illadelph_halflife|url-status=dead|archive-date=May 6, 2007|title=Album Review: Illadelph Halflife|last=Powell|first=Kevin|date=October 24, 1996|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=January 25, 2010}}</ref> and the group's work has consistently been met with critical acclaim. [[ThoughtCo]] ranked the band #7 on its list of the 25 Best Hip-Hop Groups of All-Time, calling them "Hip-hop's first legitimate band."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thoughtco.com/best-rap-groups-2857977 |title=25 Greatest Hip-Hop Groups – Best Rap Groups of All Time |website=ThoughtCo. |first=Henry |last=Adaso |date=October 12, 2017 |access-date=March 26, 2018}}</ref>

In addition to the band's music, several members of the Roots are involved in side projects, including [[record producer|record production]], acting, and regularly serving as guests on other musicians’ albums and live shows.

==Band history==

===1987–1993: Early years===
[[File:The roots-03.jpg|thumb|left|Black Thought with the Roots in 1999]]
The Roots originated in Philadelphia with Ahmir "Questlove" Thompson and Tariq "Black Thought" Trotter while they were both attending the [[Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-roots-of-questloves-success/|title=The roots of Questlove's success|work=[[CBS News]]|date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> They would [[Busking|busk]] out on the street corners with Questlove playing bucket drums and Black Thought rapping over his rhythms. Their first organized gig was a talent show in 1989 at the school where they used the name Radio Activity, which began a series of name changes that progressed through Black to the Future and then The Square Roots.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Ahmir 'Questlove' |last2=Greenman |first2=Ben |author-link2=Ben Greenman |year=2013 |title=Mo' Meta Blues: The World According to Questlove |publisher=Hachette Book Group |page=88 |chapter=Chapter 9}}</ref> Another MC, Malik B., and a permanent bass player, Leonard "Hub" Hubbard, were added to the band before the release of their first album. In 1992, they dropped the "Square" from "Square Roots" because a local folk group had claim to the name.

Unable to break through in their native Philadelphia, the band briefly moved to [[London]], where they would release their 1993 debut, ''[[Organix (The Roots album)|Organix]]''. The album was released and sold independently. In the span of a year, the band developed a cult following in Europe, boosted by touring. The Roots would receive offers from music labels, and the band eventually signed with DGC/Geffen.

===1994–1997: ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' and ''Illadelph Halflife''===
The Roots' first album for DGC, ''[[Do You Want More?!!!??!]]'', was released in the United States the year following the signing. During the recording process, beatboxer [[Rahzel]] and keyboardist [[Scott Storch]] joined the band.<ref name="amg">{{cite web|last=Bush|first= John|title=The Roots – Biography|url= {{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p168531|pure_url=yes}} |work=Allmusic|year=2008|access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> The addition of the two members provided additional depth to the band's sound, and energized the Roots' Philadelphia jam sessions, which the band would later sample for songs on ''Do You Want More?!!!??!''. The album's opening track features Black Thought introducing the band's sound as "organic hip hop jazz," and indeed; the album is characterized by a combination of contemporary [[East Coast hip hop]] and [[jazz]] influences, with a heavy reliance on Storch's [[Fender Rhodes]] and the occasional saxophone of guest musician Steve Coleman. The album spawned three singles with accompanying videos: "Proceed," "Distortion to Static," and "Silent Treatment." The album was a moderate hit among [[alternative music]] fans, boosted by the group's appearance at [[Lollapalooza]]. In 1995, the band performed at the [[Montreux Jazz Festival]]. In the years since its release, ''Do You Want More?!!!??!'' has come to be considered to be a classic [[jazz rap]] album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.vinylmeplease.com/magazine/the-ten-best-jazz-rap-albums-to-own-on-vinyl/|title=The 10 Best Jazz Rap Albums To Own On Vinyl|website=Vinylmeplease.com|date=November 4, 2016}}</ref>
[[File:The roots-01.jpg|thumb|left|The Roots in 1999]]
The 1996 release ''[[Illadelph Halflife]]'' was the group's third album and their first to break the Top 40 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart,<ref name="amg"/> spurred in part by MTV's airplay of the video for "What They Do" (a parody of rap video clichés)<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433815/19970107/roots.jhtml |title=Roots Take A Swing At Video Cliches |date=January 7, 1997 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> and "Clones," which was their first single to reach the top five on the rap charts. The band added "What They Do" was also the group's first single to hit the [[Top 40]] of [[Billboard Hot 100|Billboard's]] charts, reaching a peak of No. 34. Scott Storch left the band and was replaced by a new keyboardist, Kamal Gray. The band's sound would take a darker turn during this period, heavily influenced by [[the Wu-Tang Clan]] and the [[RZA]]'s grimy and haunting production style, replete with samples from old jazz and [[classical music]]. The album is also notable for its many guests and collaborators, including [[Common (rapper)|Common]], [[D'Angelo]], [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip]], and others. These collaborations would provide the foundation for the creation of the [[Soulquarians]] and permanently forged the Roots' association with the [[neo-soul]] subgenre.

===1998–2000: Breakthrough with ''Things Fall Apart''===
The group released [[Things Fall Apart (album)|''Things Fall Apart'']] in 1999 (named after ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'', a novel by [[Chinua Achebe]], which in turn was named after a line from "[[The Second Coming (poem)|The Second Coming]]" by W.B. Yeats). This was their breakthrough album, peaking at No. 4 on the ''Billboard'' 200 charts and earning a [[Music recording sales certification|gold record]], signifying U.S. sales of at least 500,000 units.<ref name="RIAA">{{cite web |url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&table=SEARCH_RESULTS&action=&title=&artist=The%20Roots&format=&debutLP=&category=&sex=&releaseDate=&requestNo=&type=&level=&label=&company=&certificationDate=&awardDescription=&catalogNo=&aSex=&rec_id=&charField=&gold=&platinum=&multiPlat=&level2=&certDate=&album=&id=&after=on&before=&startMonth=1&endMonth=1&startYear=1987&endYear=2009&sort=Artist&perPage=25 |title=Gold and Platinum – The Roots |publisher=RIAA |access-date=March 4, 2009}}</ref> The album was eventually certified [[RIAA certification|platinum]] in April 2013. Mos Def contributed to the track entitled "Double Trouble." The track "Act Two" features African-Belgian band [[Zap Mama]] and [[Common (rapper)|Common]]. The track "[[You Got Me (The Roots song)|You Got Me]]," a duet with [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] singer [[Erykah Badu]] and [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]] and [[Jill Scott]] intended by Black Thought for the "unconscious" population,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1433808/19990223/roots.jhtml |title=The Roots Send Wake-Up Call To "Unconscious" Population |date=February 23, 1999 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> peaked at No. 39 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 charts. At the [[42nd Grammy Awards]] "You Got Me" won the award for Best Rap Performance By a Duo or Group<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1424818/20000224/aguilera_christina.jhtml |title=Santana, Aguilera, The Roots Ponder Grammy Honors |date=February 24, 2000 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> and the album was nominated for Best Rap Album.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/04/grammy.noms.01/list.html |title=42nd Annual Grammy Awards nominations |date=January 4, 2000 |work=CNN |access-date=March 3, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124112009/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/SHOWBIZ/Music/01/04/grammy.noms.01/list.html |archive-date=January 24, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Steve Huey of the website allmusic.com perceived "a strong affinity for the neo-soul movement" in the album.<ref>{{cite web |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r397893|pure_url=yes}} |title=Things Fall Apart > Overview |last=Huey |first=Steve |year=1999 |website=AllMusic |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> First-time cameos on ''Things Fall Apart'' for Philadelphia natives [[Beanie Sigel]] and Eve helped to earn them major record deals later (with [[Roc-A-Fella Records|Roc-A-Fella]] and [[Ruff Ryders Entertainment|Ruff Ryders]], respectively). After this album, [[Dice Raw]] left the collective to record his solo debut album ''Reclaiming the Dead''. In the summer, the band performed at the [[Woodstock '99]] concert in New York state.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1427531/19990712/costello_elvis.jhtml |title=Elvis Costello, Roots, Megadeth, Others Added To Woodstock Lineup |date=July 12, 1999 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref>

===2001–2005: ''Phrenology'' and ''The Tipping Point''===
Several members, including longtime member Malik B., left the group. In December 2001, the Roots backed [[Jay-Z]] for his ''[[Jay-Z: Unplugged|MTV Unplugged]]'' concert.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451515/20011217/jay_z.jhtml |title=Roots' Questlove Gives Backstage Access To Jay-Z Unplugged |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |date=December 17, 2001 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> With heightened popularity came mounting pressure. The Roots released ''[[Phrenology (album)|Phrenology]]'' (named after the [[Phrenology|pseudoscience of the same name]]) in 2002. Despite not charting as high as ''Things Fall Apart'', reaching a peak of No. 28 on the charts, ''Phrenology'' was commercially successful, being certified gold, and earning a Grammy nomination for Best Rap Album. At the time, however, there came rumors that the Roots were losing interest in their signing with MCA.<ref name="amg"/>

During this time, the band backed Jay-Z for his 2003 farewell concert in Madison Square Garden and appeared in the accompanying ''[[Fade to Black (2004 film)|Fade to Black]]'' concert film.

After ''Phrenology'', Ben Kenney and Scratch both left the group; Kenney joined the rock band [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1471044/20030404/incubus.jhtml |title=For The Record: Quick News On Incubus, P.

In 2005, ''Home Grown! The Beginner's Guide to Understanding the Roots, Volumes 1 & 2'', a two-disc compilation album, was released. The Roots were among several performers on the 2006 film ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'', whose event took place on September 18, 2004,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1490809/20040907/west_kanye.jhtml |title=Chappelle Throwing A Block Party With Kanye, Lauryn, Others |last=Patel |first=Joseph |date=September 7, 2004 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 15, 2009}}</ref> and was released on film two years later.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1525165/03012006/story.jhtml |title=Dave Chappelle Says New Movie Will 'Let The Healing Begin' |last=Reid |first=Shaheem |date=March 1, 2006 |website=MTV News |access-date=March 15, 2009}}</ref>

===2006–2008: ''Game Theory'' and ''Rising Down''===
''[[Game Theory (album)|Game Theory]]'' was released August 29, 2006, on [[Def Jam Recordings]]. Questlove describes the album as being very dark and reflective of the political state in America.<ref name="Questlove Game Theory Interview">{{cite web | title=Questlove Game Theory Interview | url=http://rap.about.com/od/intervie2/a/RootsInterview_2.htm | access-date=July 17, 2006 }}</ref> The first single from the album, "Don't Feel Right," appeared on the internet in May 2006, and is available for free download on several websites. The album's first video, titled "The Don't Feel Right Trilogy," premiered on August 21, 2006, and features three songs, "In the Music," "Here I Come," and "Don't Feel Right." It earned an 83 on Metacritic and 2 Grammy Nominations.
The late [[J Dilla]] is honoured on different occasions throughout the album. Track 1 is credited to be "Supervised by J Dilla." Track 13 "Can't Stop This" is devoted to his persona, the first part being an edited version of a track ("Time: The Donut of the Heart") of his ''Donuts'' album, released three days before his death. This version comprises vocals by Black Thought. Secondly, a string of kindred artists reminisce about J Dilla in the form of answering machine messages.

The Roots' eighth studio album, ''[[Rising Down]]'', was released on April 29, 2008, the 16-year anniversary of the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].

In the weeks before the album's release, the original first single "Birthday Girl," a radio-friendly collaboration with Fall Out Boy's [[Patrick Stump]] was removed from the album reportedly because it didn't fit in with the album's tone.<ref>{{cite news |url={{AllMusic|class=album|id=r1341290|pure_url=yes}} |title=Rising Down > Overview |last=Brown |first=Marisa |date=April 29, 2008 |website=AllMusic |access-date=March 3, 2009}}</ref> It remained as a [[music download|digital download]] available from [[iTunes]] as a bonus track, as well as on international releases.

Picking up where ''Game Theory'' left off, the album maintains a dark and political tone, with Black Thought and several guests venting about the ills of society today. The album's guests include [[Chrisette Michele]], Common, [[Mos Def]], [[Saigon (rapper)|Saigon]], [[Styles P]], [[Talib Kweli]], and [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]]; it also features Philadelphia artists Dice Raw, [[DJ Jazzy Jeff]], [[Peedi Peedi|Peedi Crakk]], Greg Porn, and Truck North, as well as former member Malik B. ''Rising Down'' features the Roots incorporating a more electronic and [[synthesizer|synth]]-heavy feel into their sound. ''Rising Down'' was released to critical acclaim, garnering an overall score of 80 on [[Metacritic]].

The album's first single was "Rising Up" featuring Chrisette Michele and Wale.

===2009–2010: ''How I Got Over'' and ''Wake Up!''===
''[[How I Got Over (album)|How I Got Over]]'' reflects the relief the band felt at the end of the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] administration and the beginning of the [[Barack Obama|Obama]] presidency. Guests include [[Blu (rapper)|Blu]], [[Phonte]], and [[Patty Crash]]. A cover of [[Cody Chesnutt]]'s song "Serve This Royalty" was expected to be covered on the album, similar to the group's reworking of his single for [[The Seed 2.0]] on ''Phrenology''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/268305/roots-to-debut-new-single-on-jimmy-fallon |first=Mariel |last=Concepcion |title=Roots To Debut New Single On 'Jimmy Fallon' |work=Billboard |date=June 3, 2009}}</ref> Rather than relying on samples, the album was recorded live, with covers (including ''Celestial Blues'', featuring the song's original artist, [[Andy Bey]]) being reinterpreted by the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopgame.com/index2.php3?page=blackthought2 |title=Exclusive Hip Hop News, Audio, Lyrics, Videos, Honeys, Wear, Sneakers, Download Mixtapes |website=Hiphopgame.com |access-date=July 3, 2011}}</ref> The album was released on June 22, 2010.

==Members==
The Roots' original lineup included Tariq "[[Black Thought]]" Trotter ([[rapping|MC]]) and Ahmir "[[Questlove]]" Thompson (drums), classmates at the [[Philadelphia High School for the Creative and Performing Arts]].<ref name="amg"/> As they began to play at school and on local streets, they added bassist Josh "The Rubberband" Abrams, who went on to form the [[jazz]] group The Josh Abrams Quartet. They later added another MC, [[Malik B.|Malik Abdul Basit-Smart]] ("Malik B.") and [[Hub (bassist)|Leonard Nelson "Hub" Hubbard]] (bass), and [[Scott Storch]] (keyboards). Kenyatta "Kid Crumbs" Warren (MC) was in the band for Organix, the Roots' first album release. Another MC, [[Dice Raw]], joined the band in cameo appearances on later albums. The band filled Storch's position with [[Kamal Gray]] (keyboards), who continues in that capacity. Kamal Gray did not play with the Roots on ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon'' between April or May and early September 2012. His absence was not publicly explained, however on the September 17, 2012 (NBC's 'Late Night' 700th) episode, Gray returned to the group. 
[[Beatboxing|Beatboxer]] [[Rahzel]] was a band member from 1995 to 1999. Alongside Rahzel was turntablist/vocalist [[Scratch (musician)|Scratch]], who also DJ'd in live concerts. However Scratch left abruptly in 2003. 
Malik B. left the group in 1999 due to personal reasons but continued to record, making occasional cameos on some albums. Guitarist [[Ben Kenney]] had a brief stint with the group and contributed to the ''Phrenology'' album, but left to join [[Incubus (band)|Incubus]] as bassist. Percussionist Frank Knuckles joined the lineup in 2002 and guitarist [[Captain Kirk Douglas|Kirk "Captain Kirk" Douglas]] replaced Kenney. Vocalist [[Martin Luther McCoy|Martin Luther]] toured with the Roots in 2003 and 2004 and contributed to the ''Tipping Point'' album. The group announced in August 2007 that its longtime bassist Leonard Hubbard was leaving. Owen Biddle was the band's bassist in 2007–2011.

The band announced on August 25, 2011, that Owen Biddle left the band, replaced by Mark Kelley.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/inthemix/Bass-player-Owen-Biddle-leaves-The-Roots-Mark-Kelley-joins-band.html |title=Bass player Owen Biddle leaves The Roots, Mark Kelley joins the band &#124; Philadelphia Inquirer &#124; August 25, 2011 |website=Philly.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.okayplayer.com/news/mark-kelley-joins-the-roots-farewell-to-owen-biddle.html |title=Mark Kelley Joins The Roots, Farewell To Owen Biddle |website=Okayplayer |date=August 30, 2011 |access-date=April 17, 2013}}</ref> On ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon'', [[James Poyser]] plays additional keyboards.

Because most of the band members hail from Philadelphia and its surrounding area, they showed their support for the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] during the [[2009 World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]], displaying Phillies memorabilia when performing on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]''. On the episode which aired the day after the Yankees clinched the title, [[Questlove]] stated "No comment!" on the show's intro (when he usually states the episode number), and had a Yankees logo purposely displayed upside-down on his drumset. In 2010, the group showed support for the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] during their run to the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]] by having the team logo on their drumset, and again in 2014 when the Flyers faced the [[New York Rangers]] in the first round of the playoffs on ''The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon''.

In April 2017, Frank Knuckles left the Roots due to family issues, and has not appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' since then. Later in August 2017, Knuckles sued Questlove, Black Thought, and the band manager Shawn Gee over unpaid royalties.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nypost.com/2017/08/17/ex-roots-drummer-sues-questlove-black-thought-over-unpaid-royalties/|title=Ex-Roots drummer sues Questlove, Black Thought over unpaid royalties|date=August 18, 2017|work=New York Daily Post |access-date=October 30, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2009, the Roots became the official [[house band]] on ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'', with "Here I Come" as the show's theme.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5091132/the-roots-to-be-jimmy-fallons-band-we-are-old-and-sad|title=The Roots To Be Jimmy Fallon's Band; We Are Old And Sad|last=Nolan|first=Hamilton|date=November 17, 2008|work=[[Gawker]]|access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref> When [[Jimmy Fallon]] became the host of ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon|The Tonight Show]]'' in February 2014, the Roots became the house band for that show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/fallon-pull-roots-bring-tonight-article-1.1308240|title=Jimmy Fallon will stick with his Roots when he replaces Jay Leno at 'Tonight'|last=Garvey|first=Marianne|author2=Brian Niemietz |date=April 4, 2013|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|access-date=January 27, 2014|location=New York}}</ref>

The Roots are featured heavily throughout the show, providing the bumper music in and out of commercials, as well as the opening song "[[Here I Come (The Roots song)|Here I Come]]" and playing the show off the air. Fallon frequently interacts with the band during the course of the show, and they occasionally provide snippets of music for some monologue running jokes such as Funkin' GoNuts. They also provide music and drum rolls for the games with show guests, along with theme songs for the games and segments like Darts of Insanity, Wheel of Carpet Samples, and Christmas Sweaters.

On November 22, 2011, US Congresswoman and presidential candidate [[Michele Bachmann]] was a guest on ''Late Night''. For her entrance, the Roots controversially played a snippet from [[Fishbone]]'s 1985 song, "Lying Ass Bitch"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/roots-welcome-bachmann-wi_n_1107751 | title=Roots Welcome Bachmann With 'Lyin' As* B*tch' On Fallon | first=Jordan | last=Zakarin | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=November 22, 2011}}</ref> resulting in apologies from Fallon,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2011/11/23/michele-bachmann-jimmy-fallon/|title=Jimmy Fallon apologizes to Michele Bachmann for the Roots' song choice|last=Bierly|first=Mandi|date=November 23, 2011|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref> Questlove for The Roots,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/11/22/questlove-says-bachmann-song-%E2%80%98tongue-in-cheek%E2%80%99/ | title=Questlove Says Michele Bachmann Song on "Jimmy Fallon" Was "Tongue-in-Cheek" | work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date=November 22, 2011 | url-access=subscription }}</ref> and NBC.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-roots-must-clear-music-with-nbc-after-michele-bachmann-incident-20111209|title=The Roots Must Clear Music With NBC After Michele Bachmann Incident|last=Perpetua|first=Matthew|date=December 9, 2011|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=January 27, 2014}}</ref> The incident nearly resulted in the Roots being dismissed from the show, but the timing of the [[Thanksgiving (US)|Thanksgiving]] holiday and a national security gaffe<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ibtimes.com/bachmanns-iran-embassy-flub-gop-candidates-top-10-gaffes-video-377322 |title= Bachmann's Iran Embassy Flub: GOP Candidate's Top 10 Gaffes [VIDEO] |date = December 1, 2011 |website = iktimes.com |last= Jones |first= Melanie |access-date= January 30, 2014 }}</ref> by Bachmann shortly after helped defuse the situation in the media.<ref name="fire">{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/questlove-michele-bachman-fired-jimmy-fallon_n_3483466 | title=Questlove's Michele Bachmann Tribute, Tina Fey R"emarks Nearly Got Him Fired From 'Late Night With Jimmy Fallon' | last= Jacobs | first=Matthew | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=June 22, 2013}}</ref> As a result of the incident, NBC approves all walk on songs prior to the filming of each show.<ref name="fire" />

=== Sketches ===

* One of the first sketches involving the Roots was "[[List of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon sketches|Freestyling with the Roots]]." Fallon finds an audience member and gets them to talk about themselves and a topic. The information is relayed to Trotter along with a genre of music, and they then compose a song on the spot. In the early days of the show in 2009, there was apprehension about their overall fit with the show, but after the first appearance of this sketch and its successful reception, ". . . They knew they were there for life."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-roots-uestlove-on-life-on-jimmy-fallon-as-late-nights-hottest-house-band-20091120 |title=The Roots' ?uestlove on Life on Jimmy Fallon as Late Night's Hottest House Band |last=Greene |first=Andy |date=November 20, 2009 |work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=January 30, 2014}}</ref>
* [[List of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon sketches#Thank You Notes|Thank You Notes]], a segment every Friday, involves keyboardist [[James Poyser]] prominently. The segment starts with "Can I get some thank you writing music, James?" with Poyser playing and typically acting upset. Fallon then tries to engage with him to get him to smile before continuing the segment.
* [[List of Late Night with Jimmy Fallon sketches#Slow Jam the News|Slow Jam the News]] features Fallon and Trotter, often with a celebrity guest, rhyming over a "[[Slow jam|slow-jam]]" played by the Roots. The lyrics are often political or current events related, with guests usually appearing to talk about an issue pertinent to them. [[Brian Williams]] is a frequent popular guest "vocalist," talking about the news as if he were still behind his [[News anchor|anchor desk]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/brian-williams-slow-jams-_n_798173 | title=Brian Williams Slow Jams The News with Jimmy Fallon and the Roots | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=December 17, 2010}}</ref> Some of the notable guest slow-jammers include former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/obama-slow-jams-the-news-with-fallon_n_1450968 | title=Obama "Slow Jams The News" with Jimmy Fallon | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=April 24, 2012 }}</ref> and former Governor [[Mitt Romney]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.politico.com/story/2014/01/mitt-romney-jimmy-fallon-102605 | title= Mitt Romney, Jimmy Fallon "slow-jam" the news | work=[[Politico]] | date=January 25, 2014}}</ref> Like the majority of the show, the segments are uploaded to [[YouTube]] after airing on NBC and often go [[Viral video|viral]]; President Obama's clip has received over 8 million views<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAFQIciWsF4 | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/vAFQIciWsF4| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title= Jimmy Fallon – Slow Jam the News with Barack Obama |date = April 24, 2012 |website = YouTube.com |access-date= January 30, 2014 }}{{cbignore}}</ref> and the [[Mitt Romney]] clip received 2.7 million views in less than a week.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HTJaJuA0Gw | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211102/7HTJaJuA0Gw| archive-date=2021-11-02 | url-status=live|title= "Slow Jam The News" with Mitt Romney (Jimmy Fallon) |date = January 24, 2014 |website = YouTube.com |access-date= January 30, 2014 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>
* The Roots have contributed to additional online successes with the Classroom Instruments sketch. Fallon and a musical guest from the show will record an arrangement of a song with the Roots providing accompaniment on instruments that would be found in an elementary school music class. Examples of these instruments are [[Woodblock (instrument)|wood block]]s, [[pixiphone]]s, [[kazoo]]s, [[tambourine]]s, [[melodica]], [[Shaker (musical instrument)|shakers]], and [[Recorder (musical instrument)|recorders]]. They have performed "[[Call Me Maybe]]" with [[Carly Rae Jepsen]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/carly-rae-jepsen-jimmy-fallon-the-roots-call-me-maybe-video_n_1581355 | title=Carly Rae Jepsen, Jimmy Fallon & The Roots Sing "Call Me Maybe" | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=June 6, 2012}}</ref> "[[Blurred Lines]]" with [[Robin Thicke]],<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.huffpost.com/entry/jimmy-fallon-robin-thicke_n_3694670 | title=Jimmy Fallon, Robin Thicke & The Roots Perform "Blurred Lines" On Classroom Instruments | work=[[HuffPost]] | date=February 8, 2013}}</ref> "[[All I Want for Christmas Is You|All I Want for Christmas]]" with [[Mariah Carey]], "[[Hello (Adele song)|Hello]]" with [[Adele]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://time.com/4126869/adele-fallon-hello-tonight-show-classroom-instruments/ |title=Watch Adele, Jimmy Fallon, and The Roots Perform "Hello" With Kindergarten Instruments |last = Jenkins |first= Nash |date= November 25, 2015 |website=time.com |access-date=December 14, 2015}}</ref> the [[Sesame Street Theme|''Sesame Street'' theme song]] with several members of the cast,<ref>{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/jimmy-fallon-roots-sing-sesame-street-theme-song-late-night-show-muppets-article-1.1468666 |title= Jimmy Fallon, The Roots sing 'Sesame Street' theme song, play classroom instruments with Muppets |date = September 26, 2013 |website = nydailynews.com |last= Everett |first= Christina |access-date= January 30, 2014 |location=New York}}</ref> and "[[Enter Sandman]]" with [[Metallica]].

==Philanthropy==
The founding members of The Roots attended a creative arts school in South Philadelphia called CAPA, and through a donation helped set up the CAPA Foundation, where they now sit on the board.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Roots To Partner With Their Philadelphia Alma Mater CAPA |url=https://philadelphia.cbslocal.com/2014/11/04/the-roots-to-partner-with-their-philadelphia-alma-matter-capa/ |access-date=7 December 2018 |publisher=CBS |date=4 November 2014}}</ref> The Roots partnership with the CAPA Foundation also includes opportunities for students to perform on national stages, learn through internships the business side of show business and a master class series.

* ''[[...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin]]'' (2014)

A distinctive feature of the Roots albums is the way tracks are numbered. With the exception of their collaboration albums, the Roots have used continuous track numbering beginning with their first studio album ''[[Organix (The Roots album)|Organix]]'' through all following albums:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.therootsarchive.com/?q=node/67 |title=The Numbered Tracks |website=TheRootsArchive.com |access-date=April 17, 2013}}</ref>
* 1–17: ''Organix''
* 18–33: ''Do You Want More?!!!??!''
* 34–53: ''Illadelph Halflife''
* 54–71: ''Things Fall Apart''
* 72–76: ''The Legendary''
* 77–86: ''The Roots Come Alive''
* 87–102: ''Phrenology''
* 103–113: ''The Tipping Point''
* 114–127: ''Game Theory''
* 128–143: ''Rising Down''
* 143–156: ''How I Got Over''
* 157–170: ''Undun''
* 171–181: ''...And Then You Shoot Your Cousin''

[[Questlove]] references this numbering system in his book ''Mo' Meta Blues: The World According to Questlove'' (specifically to the release of ''[[Illadelph Halflife]]''), and explains it was "...our way of saying that it was a continuation of the work we had started on ''[[Organix (The Roots album)|Organix]]'' and ''[[Do You Want More?!!!??!]]''."<ref>
{{cite book |last1=Thompson |first1=Ahmir 'Questlove' |last2=Greenman |first2=Ben |author-link2=Ben Greenman |year=2013 |title=Mo' Meta Blues: The World According to Questlove| publisher=Hachette Book Group |page=142 |chapter=Chapter 12}}</ref>

Similarly, the Roots' 2005 compilation albums, ''Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 1'' and ''Vol. 2'', feature a continuous track numbering beginning at negative 29 and counting up to zero. The implication is that this "Beginners Guide" would introduce new fans to the Roots and lead them to consuming the Roots' discography beginning at ''Organix''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
* −29 thru −14: ''Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 1''
* −13 thru 0: ''Home Grown! The Beginners Guide to Understanding The Roots, Vol. 2''
