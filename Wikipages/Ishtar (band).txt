'''Ishtar''' is a Belgian (Flemish) [[folk music|folk]] band who represented Belgium at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song "[[O Julissi]]", sung in an imaginary language. They competed in the first semi-final on 20 May 2008.

== O Julissi ==
"'''[[O Julissi]]'''" is a song by Ishtar. The band's site [http://www.ishtar.be/functions/content.asp?Pag=11&pnav=;24;] claims that the song is in an imaginary language. There is, however, a certain similarity to [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]; in particular, the first line is fully understandable (Ukrainian "Ой у лісі на ялині", meaning "Oh, in the forest on a [[spruce]]"). The [[folk music|folk]] song represented [[Belgium]] at the semi-finals of [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008]], at 20 May 2008, in [[Belgrade]], but did not proceed to the finals. The single was released 14 March 2008. The song entered the Belgian [[Ultratop]] at #7. In its second week, O Julissi topped the list.

Ishtar's song was elected after they won the final of [[Eurosong (Belgium)|Eurosong 2008]]. Ishtar, until then an unknown band, defeated better known artists, like pop singers [[Sandrine Van Handenhoven|Sandrine]] and [[Brahim Attaeb|Brahim]]. The  other contestants in the final were rock group [[Paranoiacs]] and [[Nelson (artist)|Nelson]], who had written a modern ballad.
