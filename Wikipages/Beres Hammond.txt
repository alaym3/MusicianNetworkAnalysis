'''Beres Hammond [[Order of Jamaica|OJ]]''' (born '''Hugh Beresford Hammond'''; 28 August 1955, in Annotto Bay, [[Saint Mary Parish, Jamaica|Saint Mary]], [[Jamaica]])<ref name="Moskowitz">Moskowitz, David V. (2006) ''Caribbean Popular Music: an Encyclopedia of Reggae, Mento, Ska, Rock Steady, and Dancehall'', Greenwood Press, {{ISBN|0-313-33158-8}}, p. 128-9</ref><ref name="Huey">Huey, Steve "[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p37370|pure_url=yes}} Beres Hammond Biography]", [[Allmusic]], retrieved 2 February 2010</ref> is a Jamaican [[reggae]] singer known in particular for his [[lovers rock]] music.  While his career began in the 1970s, he reached his greatest success in the 1990s.

==Biography==
Born the ninth of ten children, Hammond grew up listening to his father's collection of American [[soul (music)|soul]] and [[jazz]] music including [[Sam Cooke]] and [[Otis Redding]].<ref name="Huey" /> He was further influenced by the native music of [[ska]] and [[rocksteady]], in particular [[Alton Ellis]].<ref name="Huey" />

Hammond began participating in local talent contests from 1972 to 1973,<ref name="Moskowitz" /> which led to his first [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]], of Ellis' "Wanderer".<ref name="Huey" /> In 1975 he joined the band, [[Zap Pow]], as lead singer,<ref name="Larkin">Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The Virgin Encyclopedia of Reggae'', Virgin Books, {{ISBN|0-7535-0242-9}}, p. 118-9</ref> leading to the [[chart-topper|hit]] 1978 single, "The System" under the [[Aquarius Records (Canada)|Aquarius Records]] label. However, he simultaneously sought a solo career, releasing his debut album, ''[[Soul Reggae]]'', in 1976.<ref name="Huey" /> His solo [[ballad]]s "One Step Ahead" (1976) and [[Joe Gibbs (record producer)|Joe Gibbs]] produced "I'm in Love" (1978), were both hits in Jamaica.<ref name="Huey" /> He left Zap Pow in 1979 to pursue his solo career, and recorded two more albums ''Let's Make A Song'' in 1980 and ''Red Light'' 1981.  He formed Tuesday's Children, a [[harmony]] group that toured but never recorded.<ref name="Huey" />

Hammond formed his own record label, Harmony House Records, in 1985 for the release of his ''Make a Song'' album,<ref name="Moskowitz" /> which had two Jamaican chart-toppers that were influenced by the emerging [[dancehall]] style: "Groovy Little Thing" and "What One Dance Can Do".<ref name="Huey" /> The latter, produced by Willie Lindo,<ref name="Larkin" /> began to break Hammond into the international market.  He scored another hit in 1986 with "Settling Down" on his eponymous release.  He left his fame in Jamaica for New York City in 1987,<ref name="Moskowitz" /> after being tied up as thieves ransacked his house during a [[home invasion]].<ref name="Huey" /> There he recorded the ''Have a Nice Weekend'' album and the duet single "How Can We Ease the Pain" with [[Maxi Priest]].<ref name="Larkin" />

Hammond returned briefly to Jamaica to record ''Putting Up Resistance'', which was significantly harder than his typical ballads, produced by [[Tappa Zukie]], which spawned the hits "Putting Up Resistance" and "Strange".<ref name="Huey" /> He signed with Penthouse Records in 1990 and returned to Jamaica permanently to record the dancehall smash "Tempted to Touch", with producer [[Donovan Germain]].<ref name="Larkin" /> This is perhaps his best known song in the United States and United Kingdom, and set the foundation for the hits "Is This a Sign" and "Respect to You Baby" on the 1992 ''Love Affair'' album.<ref name="Huey" /> Also in 1992, Beres released the single "Fire". The song received critical acclaim within the Reggae music industry and it was an extremely sought after 7" single. Now garnering interest from major studios such as [[Elektra Records]], Hammond recorded five more albums in the 1990s as well as several [[compilation album|compilations]], establishing himself as one of the top [[lovers rock]] artists.  His first album of the new millennium was 2001's ''Music Is Life'', which featured an appearance by [[Wyclef Jean]], and contributions from [[Earl "Chinna" Smith]] and [[Flourgon]]. The album spawned several hits, including "They Gonna Talk", "Rockaway" and "Ain't It Good To Know".<ref name="Moskowitz" /><ref name="Huey" /> The 2004 release ''Love Has No Boundaries'', had guest spots by [[Buju Banton]] and [[Big Youth]].<ref name="Huey" />

Hammond returned to Jamaica to perform at the [[Cricket World Cup 2007 Opening Ceremony|Opening Ceremony]] for the [[Cricket World Cup 2007]],<ref name="Becca">Becca, Tony (2007) "[http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20070311/sports/sports1.html Welcome to Cricket world cup 2007 – HOWZAT!
