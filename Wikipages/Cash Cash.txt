== History ==

=== Early years (2002–2007) ===
Cash Cash members Jean Paul Makhlouf and Sam Frisch first began playing together under the name The Consequence in 2002.<ref name=hip>{{cite web|url=http://www.hiponline.com/6134/cash-cash-biography.html |title=Cash Cash – biography |publisher=Hip Online (mirror at [[Internet Archive]] cached on March 4, 2010) |date=October 21, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304100337/http://www.hiponline.com/6134/cash-cash-biography.html |archive-date=March 4, 2010}}</ref><ref name=amg>{{cite web|last=Jeffries |first=David |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cash-cash-mn0001035160 |title=Cash Cash – Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic (mirror at [[Internet Archive]] cached on July 7, 2012) |date=December 23, 2008 |access-date=June 22, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120707044149/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/cash-cash-mn0001035160 |archive-date=July 7, 2012}}</ref> As The Consequence, the band put out three releases independently, ''Your Own Place'' (2004),<ref name=hip/> ''The Consequence'' (2005),<ref name=hip/> and ''By The Bedside'' (2006).<ref name=hip/><ref name=amg/> The band went through various keyboardists and drummers before solidifying the group with Alexander Makhlouf and drummer Anthony Villacari in 2007.<ref name=amg/><ref name="emptylighthouse1">{{cite web|url=http://emptylighthouse.com/content/get-know-cash-cash |title=Get To Know: Cash Cash |publisher=Emptylighthouse.com |access-date=July 19, 2014}}</ref>

=== ''Take It to the Floor'' (2008–2010) ===
In early 2008, the group coalesced under the name Cash Cash, with members Jean Paul Makhlouf, Alexander Makhlouf, and Samuel Frisch. They came up with the name Cash Cash due to legal issues that arose from not trademarking their previous name 'The Consequence'. In an interview Jean Paul stated, ''"''Basically we were in a previous group growing up and never thought to copyright the name because when you're a young local garage band, you don't have the money and don't think it really matters. Well after we signed our first record deal, it kind of did matter. We got hit with a ton of legal notices about it from the person who owned the name, and had this old agent trying to screw us over, so when putting the new group together out of frustration, I was like, we should just name this group 'Cash Cash' because every one is after our cash, and we don't have any yet.''"''<ref name="emptylighthouse1"/><ref>{{cite web |author=Patrick Cason |url=http://goodmusicallday.com/music/cash-cash-brings-lightning-to-edcny-festival-review-interview/ |title=Cash Cash Brings 'Lightning' To EDCNY!
