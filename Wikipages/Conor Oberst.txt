==Career==

===Early career===
One night in 1992, [[Ted Stevens (musician)|Ted Stevens]] (of [[Mayday (American band)|Mayday]] and [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]]) invited Oberst onstage to play. Bill Hoover, who was in attendance, invited Oberst to come back to play with him a couple of weeks later. In that short amount of time, Oberst wrote enough songs to fill out the set, establishing himself as an artist.<ref>[http://www.timmcmahan.com/brighteyes.htm Lazy-I Interview: Bright Eyes (December 1998)] Retrieved on January 4, 2008.</ref> Shortly thereafter, Oberst began committing his new repertoire to tape in his parents' [[basement]] with his father's four track cassette recorder and an acoustic guitar.

In mid-1993, Oberst self-released his debut album ''[[Water (Conor Oberst album)|Water]]'' on [[cassette tape]].<ref>Norris, Chris" (June 25, 2009), "Conor Oberst's Mystical Awakening". ''Rolling Stone'' (1081):</ref> The release of the album was financed by his brother Justin on what they called [[Lumberjack Records]], the [[indie label]] that would become [[Saddle Creek Records]], making them [[Organizational founder|founders]] and present day [[corporate officer|executives]] of the label.

Shortly after his two solo recordings, Oberst began playing with four friends; they formed [[Commander Venus]] in mid-1995.

''Here's to Special Treatment'' was followed by 1996's ''[[The Soundtrack to My Movie]]'', a cassette only released on Sing Eunuchs!. ''[[Kill the Monster Before It Eats Baby]]'', a split 7-inch vinyl with Bill Hoover, was also released around this time.

===The Faint (1994–1995)===
In 1994, following a [[Slowdown Virginia]] show, Oberst, along with [[Joel Petersen]] and brothers [[Todd Fink]] and [[Clark Baechle]], formed a band called [[Norman Bailer]], later known as [[The Faint]].

A few days later, Oberst told the other members of the band that they had a show in two weeks at Kilgore's. Despite having never performed together, they produced nine songs to perform. An album, ''[[Sine Sierra]]'', was released (on cassette only) in 1995.

===Commander Venus (1994–1998)===
{{Main|Commander Venus}}
Oberst formed the rock band [[Commander Venus]] in 1994 with [[Tim Kasher]], Ben Armstrong, and [[Robb Nansel]]. They recorded two albums: ''[[Do You Feel at Home?]]'' (1995) and ''[[The Uneventful Vacation]]'' (1997). Kasher later went on to form [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]] and Nansel was the co-founder of Saddle Creek Records. Kasher left the group to focus on [[Cursive (band)|Cursive]] as they were about to go into the studio to record their second album, and was replaced by Todd Baechle. Commander Venus disbanded in 1998.

===The Magnetas (1996)===
'''The Magnetas''' were only active for a very brief period of time in 1996 in Omaha. Along with Oberst, band members included [[Todd Fink]] ([[the Faint]]) and Chris Hughes ([[Beep Beep (band)|Beep Beep]]). They recorded three songs, only one of which ("Annex Anex") was released on Ghostmeat Records ''Parts'' compilation album. Two other confirmed recordings exist: "Clatter" and "Science Fiction in Schools".

===Park Ave. (1996)===
{{Main|Park Ave.}}
In January 1996, Oberst began playing drums in a group named [[Park Ave.]], alongside Clark Baechle, Jenn Bernard, [[Neely Jenkins]] (now in the band [[Tilly and the Wall]]), and [[Jamie Pressnall|Jamie Williams]] (also in [[Tilly and the Wall]]). The group only played between 10 and 15 shows and made a handful of recordings (several of them with [[Mike Mogis]] as producer). The group disbanded in 1998 when Williams, the singer and primary songwriter, moved to London, England. In 1999, Urinine Records released their only album, ''When Jamie Went to London&nbsp;... We Broke Up'', which has also now been re-released under [[Team Love]].

One year later, Bright Eyes released its first EP, ''[[Every Day and Every Night]]''. Bright Eyes' third album, ''[[Fevers and Mirrors]]'' was released in May 2000; it was ranked 170 on [[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'s list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/staff-lists/7706-the-top-200-albums-of-the-2000s-200-151/4/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|author=Pitchfork staff|title=The Top 200 Albums of the 2000s: 200-151|date=September 28, 2009|access-date=October 1, 2009}}</ref>

With the release of 2002's ''[[Lifted or The Story Is in the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground]]'', Bright Eyes received national attention and Oberst was proclaimed a breakthrough artist by several notable magazines. On January 25, 2005, Bright Eyes simultaneously released two new albums: the folk ''[[I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning]]'' and more electronic-pop ''[[Digital Ash in a Digital Urn]]''.

The band subsequently released ''[[The People's Key]]'' on Conor's 31st birthday, February 15, 2011.

===Desaparecidos (2001–2002, 2012–present)===
{{Main|Desaparecidos (band)}}
Oberst is a guitarist and singer for [[Desaparecidos (band)|Desaparecidos]]. The music and lyrics of Desaparecidos differ greatly from Bright Eyes, having more in common with [[punk rock]] than Oberst's usual [[folk rock]]. The lyrics are generally [[social commentary]] on the state of affairs in [[United States of America|America]] and the pitfalls of the suburban lifestyle, as opposed to the more introspective lyrics of Bright Eyes. Desaparecidos was active as a band between 2001–2002 but have regrouped to play shows in the Omaha area. They had two releases in 2002: a single for "The Happiest Place on Earth" and the full-length ''Read Music / Speak Spanish'', on [[Saddle Creek Records]].

In 2012, the band regrouped and self-released the 7-inch single "MariKKKopa/Backsell", as well as continuing to tour. In 2013, they released two more 7-inches independently, "Anonymous / The Left is Right" and "Te Amo Camila Vallejo / The Underground Man" (dedicated to the Chilean student activist [[Camila Vallejo]]), and complimented these releases with yet another tour. In 2015, the band announced the release of a new studio album, ''[[Payola (Desaparecidos album)|Payola]]'', on June 23 on [[Epitaph Records]].<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/conor-oberst-plots-new-lp-with-revived-punk-band-20150406 |title=Conor Oberst Plots New LP With Revived Punk Band |author=Ryan Reed |magazine=[[Rolling Stone]] |date=April 6, 2015 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://pitchfork.com/news/59585-conor-obersts-band-desaparecidos-announce-tour/ |title=Conor Oberst's Band Desaparecidos Announce Tour |author=Eric Torres |website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]] |date=May 14, 2015 |access-date=May 18, 2015}}</ref>

And for a second, to have the whole world think that [the allegations were] true about me just did a number on my psyche." He also went on to emphasize that he did not want to minimize how frequently women are sexually assaulted, citing the statistic that one in four women will experience sexual assault at some point and saying that "as painful and surreal and fucked up as my situation was, I don't ever want to use this as an example to justify anything."<ref name="Vice2"/>

I remember feeling bad afterwards when I had described the way my brother passed away, not thinking about&nbsp;... my niece and nephew. They're definitely old enough to read an article."<ref name="fader-bright"/> In the same 2020 interview, Oberst clarified the circumstances of Matthew's death: "It was kind of inconclusive.

Oberst co-founded the [[Team Love Records|Team Love]] record label (along with Nate Krenkel, longtime manager of Bright Eyes) to "do different things, or smaller things, that we couldn't get everyone to be into at the same time" at Saddle Creek.<ref>{{cite news

===Pageturners Lounge===
Oberst opened Pageturners Lounge, a bar, with Philip Schaffart in 2012. Pageturners Lounge is located in the [[Dundee-Happy Hollow Historic District|Dundee]] neighborhood in [[Omaha, NE|Omaha]]. The business name is a holdover from the bookstore that formerly occupied the space.<ref>

==Artistry==

===Music style and influences===
Oberst was drawn to music at a very early age, due in part to his brother Matt's penchant for bands like [[The Smiths]], [[R.E.M.]], [[Fugazi]], and [[The Cure]]. He has cited The Cure's first singles collection, ''[[Staring at the Sea]]'', as the first record he ever bought, as well as being one of his favorites. "It must have been third grade&nbsp;... I bought the [[compact cassette|cassette]] at a local record store chain called Homer's in Omaha. I just loved the sound of [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith's]] voice. It just sounded good."<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071001201539/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/myfirstalbum/story/8857226/conor_oberst_of_bright_eyes_on_the_cures_standing_on_a_beach?rnd=1141186879185&has-player=true&version=6.0.12.1040 RollingStone.com – Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes on the Cure's Standing on a Beach]. Retrieved on January 4, 2008.</ref>

Some of his biggest influences and favorite songwriters are local musicians [[David Dondero]] and [[Simon Joyner]].<ref>[http://cwas.hinah.com/interview/?id=30 Comes With A Smile – Interview: Bright Eyes (Conor Oberst) by Mariko Sakamoto] Retrieved on January 4, 2008.</ref> Joyner wrote the song "Burn Rubber", which Bright Eyes covered on the "[[Take It Easy (Love Nothing)]]" single. The two used to do mini-tours together, usually on weekends due to Joyner having a family.

Oberst has also been heavily influenced by the 1960s [[folk revival]], mentioning [[Neil Young]], [[Leonard Cohen]], and country singers [[Emmylou Harris]], [[John Prine]] and [[Townes Van Zandt]].<ref name="Ferguson">{{cite interview
| subject       = Conor Oberst
| interviewer   = [[Craig Ferguson]]
| title       = [[The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson]]
}}</ref> Harris sang on a few tracks on Bright Eyes' ''[[I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning]]''. As a prolific and well-known musician in the folk genre, he has sometimes been defined as "a new [[Bob Dylan]]." He covered Neil Young's "[[Out on the Weekend]]", collaborating with [[Mike Mogis]], [[Jim James]] and [[M. Ward]] in concert. He performed the Townes Van Zandt song "Rex's Blues" live with fellow musician [[Steve Earle]]. He has also performed two of John Prine's songs live, "Crazy as a Loon" and "Wedding Day in Funerville".<ref name="Block">{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4285614|title=A Chat with Conor Oberst of Bright Eyes|first=Melissa|last=Block|website=Npr.org|date=January 14, 2005}}</ref>

Oberst was greatly influenced by [[Daniel Johnston]], whose "Devil Town" was covered and featured on ''[[Noise Floor (Rarities: 1998-2005)|Noise Floor]]'', and profoundly influenced by [[Elliott Smith]], stating in an October 22, 2003 ''All Things Considered'' interview that, "sometimes when you're not feeling good, you have to listen to really sad music like Elliott Smith's" and that [Smith] "wrote the sweetest, saddest, most gentle songs". Oberst also said he liked to "listen to Elliott Smith's songs when he [couldn't] find anyone to talk to on the phone" and thought that it was sad that "through his music, [Smith] had the ability to answer feelings in others that he was unable to answer in himself".<ref>[http://www-cdn.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1475177 Singer Elliott Smith Dead in Apparent Suicide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727132505/http://www-cdn.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1475177 |date=July 27, 2011 }} Retrieved on May 30, 2009.</ref> A live cover of Smith's "The Biggest Lie" is featured on ''[[Motion Sickness]]''.
