'''Yano''' is a Filipino [[folk music|folk]]/[[punk rock]] band formed in 1992.  The band members were originally composed of [[Dong Abay]] on vocals and Eric Gancio on guitar. Onie Badiang later joined them to play bass. Nowie Favila was the usual drummer but declined to join the group due to commitments with Ang Grupong Pendong. Other drummers of the band included Nonong Timbalopez, Harley Alarcon and Jun Nogoy. The band got their name when Abay looked through an entry in "''Talahulugang Pilipino''", an old [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] dictionary.  "Yano" in Tagalog means "[[wikt:simple|simple]]", a term often used by Tagalog speakers in the province of [[Quezon]].  The group disbanded in 1997 after Abay left the band.

In 2007, Gancio revived Yano as a [[one-man band]], although he continued to use [[sideman|sidemen]] as backing musicians for live performances.<ref>{{cite news|title=Yano to rock Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah|url=http://gulfnews.com/life-style/music/yano-to-rock-dubai-and-ras-al-khaimah-1.1302687|access-date=28 January 2016|last=De los Santos|first=Felicidad|date=11 March 2014|newspaper=[[Gulf News]]}}</ref><ref name="minda">{{cite web |url=http://www.mindanaotimes.com.ph/story.php?id=18846 |title=Gancio relaunches Yano |access-date=February 6, 2008 |date=December 19, 2007 |publisher=Mindanao Times}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In later years, Gancio while performing vocals and lead guitars is accompanied by JR Madarang on bass and Ronald Madarang on drums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yano.ph/index.html#section-3 |title=Yano Power Trio |access-date=April 15, 2014 |publisher=Yano's Official Website}}</ref>  In 2013, Yano released their fourth studio album titled ''Talâ ''(Star).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://opmfair.com.ph/2013/2013/09/30/yano-2/|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131125222042/http://opmfair.com.ph/2013/2013/09/30/yano-2/|archive-date = 2013-11-25|title = DotPH domains available portal}}</ref>

==History==<!-- This section is linked from [[Pan]] -->

In 1994, the band's [[Yano (album)|self-titled debut album]] came out, with rock songs including "''Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo''"

===Yano continues===
In the middle of the recording of their 3rd album 'Tara', Abay struggled with [[clinical depression]] and stayed in his bedroom for about three years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200301/16002768.html |title=Dong Abay's Pan: Another Gem |access-date=2008-01-11 |date=2006-01-16 |publisher=[[MTV Asia]] News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926231937/http://www.mtvasia.com/News/200301/16002768.html |archive-date=2007-09-26 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Gancio finished the album alone, singing the vocal tracks to have of the album's songs.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Abay came out of depression while writing new songs set into [[poetry]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  He and Badiang formed another band, Pan, with bassist [[Milo Duane Cruz]] and drummer [[Melvin Leyson]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They released their debut album entitled ''[[Parnaso ng Payaso]]'' in 2003. Pan was later disbanded because Abay went back to school in [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} He released ''Sampol'', an [[Extended play|EP]] in 2005, which was later reborn into ''Flipino'' and released in May 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Badiang played bass for Filipino folk/rock band [[Asin (band)|Asin]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

===Yano in Davao===
Gancio returned to his homeland in [[Davao City|Davao]] after finishing the recording of the 3rd album ''Tara'' in 1998.  In 2004, he released his solo album ''Sa Bandang Huli'' (At the Very End).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Gancio did all the instruments in his [[independent record label|indie]]-released album and mixed the music at his home in a PC-based [[software]].  In 2007, Gancio took into the band session Bassist Dave Ibao and Drummer Jan Najera.  He said he would be releasing an album, which, according to Gancio, will be the "fourth Yano album" instead of his second album. Hence,  in 2013, Yano released a 4th album titled ''Talâ ''(Star) under Yano Records.  The band is still based in [[Davao City]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

In September 2014, Yano released its 5th album ''Ya Hindi No'' under Yano Records.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Yano has just launched it during P FEST UK on the last week of the same month in Leeds and Romford.  The same year, Ronald Madarang was removed from the band and the next year, 2015, Ej Santos became the new drummer.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Music==
Yano's music is a fusion of western elements into Filipino ethnic music.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  It is also known for their [[political]] and [[social]] themes.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}  Their songs censure religious hypocrites like in ''Banal Na Aso, Santong Kabayo'' ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for ''Holy Dog, Saintly Horse''), corrupt politicians in ''Trapo'' ([[colloquial]], [[pejorative]] [[acronym]] for "traditional politicians", also literally translates to "dust rag"), the [[coño English|lingo]] of the Philippine's [[elite]] in ''Coño Ka P’re'' ("You're a ''[[wikt:coño|coño]]''") and abusive [[capitalists]] in ''Mc’Jo'' (alluding to the [[fastfood]] chains [[McDonald's]] and [[Jollibee]].{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Yano's songs also narrate the situation of Philippine society during the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} ''Kumusta Na?'' ("How are you?") discusses the condition of the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] masses after the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]] while the [[novelty song|novelty]]-styled song ''Kaka'' tells a story of a person named Kaka, who is having difficulty in finding things in the dark after a power outage, a reference to the frequent [[power outage|blackout]]s in the Philippines during the early 1990s.  The song ''[[Bawal (Yano album)|Bawal]]'' ("prohibited") speaks about the effects of rules or laws with excessive restrictions to the point where it leads to suppression of freedom and love. ''Abno'', also known as ''Abnormal Environmental'', tackles the [[Natural environment|environment]] while ''Kaklase'' ("classmate") focuses on students facing maltreatment by their teachers.  Another social relevant song, ''Mercy'', tells about the story of a crazy peddler in the Philippines known as a ''taong [[Petroleum|grasa]]'' ("greasy person").{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}
