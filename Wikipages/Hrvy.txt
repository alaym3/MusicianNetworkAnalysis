=== Television ===
[[File:Instagram post by HRVY • Nov 16, 2016 at 7 32pm.jpg|thumb|240px|Backstage before ''[[Friday Download]]'', November 2016]]
Cantwell appeared as one of six presenters of the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] television show ''[[Friday Download]]'' for [[Friday Download#Series 7|Series 7]] to Series 9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/fridaydownload|title=Friday Download - CBBC - BBC|website=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title= Friday Download Credits|url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/cbbc/shows/fridaydownload#credits |work=bbc.co.uk|access-date= September 4, 2020}}</ref><ref name="New"/> On 26 February 2020, he appeared in an episode of the [[CBBC (TV channel)|CBBC]] singing show ''[[Got What It Takes?]]'' by surprising the contestants as they were learning his own song "Personal" for that week's sing-off. He was also a mentor in the same episode during a [[music video]] challenge.

In September 2020, it was announced that he would be competing in the [[Strictly Come Dancing (series 18)|eighteenth series]] of ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2020-09-04/hrvy-strictly-come-dancing-2020-contestant/amp/|title=Meet HRVY – Strictly Come Dancing contestant and singer|work=[[Radio Times]]|date=4 September 2020}}</ref><ref name="York"/> He was partnered with [[Janette Manrara]]. They were the first pair to receive a 10 from any judge in the series for their Salsa in Week 4, and scored the first perfect 30/30 of the series in Week 6 for their Street routine (due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, [[Bruno Tonioli]] was unable to travel to the UK to take part as a judge, hence the maximum score was only 30 rather than the usual 40). They finished top of the judges' leaderboard on three separate occasions, the most of any couple in the series, and also placed joint-first on the judges' leaderboard in the grand-final, scoring a total of 88 out of 90; with the exception of eventual winners [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Oti Mabuse]], they were the only other couple in the series to never place in the bottom two during any week. The pair eventually finished in second place alongside [[Jamie Laing]] & [[Karen Hauer]] and [[Maisie Smith]] & [[Gorka Márquez]], losing out to [[Bill Bailey]] and [[Oti Mabuse]] on the public vote.
