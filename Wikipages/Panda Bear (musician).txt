'''Noah Benjamin Lennox''' (born July 17, 1978), also known by his moniker '''Panda Bear''', is an American musician, singer-songwriter and co-founding member of the [[experimental pop]] band [[Animal Collective]]. In addition to his work with that group, Lennox has released six solo LPs since 1999. His third, ''[[Person Pitch]]'' (2007), is noted for influencing a wide range of subsequent [[indie music]]<ref name="AMbio">{{cite web|last1=Reges|first1=Margaret|title=Panda Bear|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/panda-bear-mn0000109628/biography|website=[[AllMusic]]}}</ref> in addition to inspiring the [[chillwave]] genre and numerous soundalike acts.<ref name="Carew2011">{{cite web|last1=Carew|first1=Anthony|title=Perfecting the pitch|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/perfecting-the-pitch-20110518-1eti5.html|website=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=May 20, 2011}}</ref>

Lennox was primarily raised in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, where he sang [[tenor]] in his high school chamber choir, and studied piano and cello. The name "Panda Bear" derived from his habit of drawing pandas on his early [[mixtape]]s as a teenager. He is currently based in [[Lisbon]], Portugal.

==Early life==
Lennox grew up in the [[Roland Park, Baltimore|Roland Park]] section of [[Baltimore]], Maryland, and attended [[Waldorf School of Baltimore]] through 8th grade, and Kimberton Waldorf School in Chester County, Pennsylvania for high school. His family moved frequently during his early years, owing to his father's studies to be an orthopedic surgeon. As a youth, he played sports, mainly soccer and basketball. His brother, Matt Lennox (the Animal Collective song [[Brother Sport]] is directed at him), was a leading player on the high school basketball team and Noah was also a team member, playing as [[point guard]].<ref>Costello, Lou (December 6, 1993).

He "Picks Up Other Guys When They're Down," Says Ray Jenkins]. ''Inquirer''. Retrieved on March 6, 2016.</ref>

Lennox has also stated in interviews that he enjoyed drawing a lot as a teenager, especially pandas, and later started drawing pandas on his early mixtapes. He also studied piano until he was eight, then cello, and later on he sang [[tenor]] in his high school [[chamber choir]].<ref name=themilkfactory>{{cite web|url=http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/pandabeariw.htm|title=PANDA BEAR Interview|date=March 9, 2009|access-date=January 15, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309062058/http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/pandabeariw.htm|archive-date=March 9, 2009}}</ref>

Though he and his family have never been very religious, Lennox briefly attended [[Boston University]], where he majored in religion because of his interest in "the concept of God".<ref name=mafama>{{cite web|url=http://mafama.blogspot.com/2007/01/panda-bear-m-fama.html |title={.::Má Fama::.}: Panda Bear |website=Mafama.blogspot.com |date=January 8, 2007 |access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Career==
===Animal Collective===
{{main|Animal Collective}}
As a teen, Lennox began listening to electronic music styles such as [[House music|house]] and [[techno]], and artists such as [[Aphex Twin]], all of which became a major influence on his later work.<ref name="mafama"/> He recorded and performed music—solo and with friends. Lennox started using the name "Panda Bear" because he drew pictures of [[Giant panda|pandas]] for the artwork of his recordings.<ref name=themilkfactory />

Lennox had been friends with [[Deakin (musician)|Deakin]] (Josh Dibb) since the second grade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=5455&Title=Animal+Collective+-+Strawberry+Jam|title=PBS 106.7FM – Real Radio – Animal Collective – Strawberry Jam|date=July 22, 2008|access-date=January 15, 2018|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080722082744/http://pbsfm.org.au/Documents.asp?ID=5455&Title=Animal+Collective+-+Strawberry+Jam|archive-date=July 22, 2008}}</ref> Deakin introduced Lennox to his high school friends [[Avey Tare]] (Dave Portner) and [[Geologist (musician)|Geologist]] (Brian Weitz). For years, the four of them swapped homemade recordings, shared musical ideas and performed in different group configurations. Lennox, along with Deakin moved to New York in 2000.<ref>Coyle, Jake. [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/12/AR2007101201369.html "Animal Collective Sings Alien Pop Tunes"], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 12, 2007.</ref> The band then became more collaborative in nature and they finally settled on the name "Animal Collective". 
[[File:Animal Collective-7.jpg|thumb|left|Lennox performing with Animal Collective in 2007]]
Since the 2007 releases of Panda Bear's ''[[Person Pitch]]'' and Animal Collective's ''[[Strawberry Jam]]'', he has focused more on using samplers and other electronics in their shows. He has named [[Black Dice]] as a major influence stating "Black Dice took us on our first tour and I feel like the wisest things I've learned about being in a band I learned by watching them."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/pandabeariw.htm|title=PANDA BEAR Interview|date=February 22, 2012|access-date=January 15, 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222045759/http://www.themilkfactory.co.uk/interviews/pandabeariw.htm|archive-date=February 22, 2012}}</ref> He said he looks to ''Black Dice'' "as a model for a band... I feel like as a band, I can't speak for the other guys [of Animal Collective], but certainly for myself, like I modelled the way I approach to everything with the band watching the way ''Black Dice'' did it."<ref>[http://www.magicrpm.com/videos/saga/animal-collective/saga-animal-collective-5-5 Magic's Saga Animal Collective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714020739/http://www.magicrpm.com/videos/saga/animal-collective/saga-animal-collective-5-5 |date=July 1, 2011}} Part 5/5, Magicrpm.com, February 5, 2009</ref> In addition to singing, Lennox played drums and occasionally guitar in Animal Collective's live performances. He cites [[Stewart Copeland]] as the biggest influence on his drumming style.<ref name="mafama"/>

===Solo work===
Lennox's early musical influences included [[electronic music|electronic]] styles, and his solo work has been variously characterized as experimental pop,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://consequenceofsound.net/2015/11/panda-bears-video-for-crosswords-is-a-one-man-kaleidoscopic-dance-party-watch/|title=Panda Bear's video for "Crosswords" is a one-man kaleidoscopic dance party — watch|author=Ben Kaye|work=[[Consequence of Sound]]|access-date=February 18, 2016|date=November 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/culture/music/panda-bear-panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-1.2051212|title=Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> electronic,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thelast-magazine.com/cmj-2015-panda-bear/ |title=CMJ 2015: PANDA BEAR |publisher=The Last Magazine |date=October 2, 2015|access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> [[bedroom pop]],<ref name="djbooth">{{cite web|last1=Dorn|first1=Anna|title=Bedroom Rap: An Introduction|url=http://djbooth.net/news/entry/2016-09-16-bedroom-rap-an-introduction|website=Djbooth.net|date=September 16, 2016}}</ref> [[neo-psychedelia|neo-psychedelic pop]],<ref name="DummyMag2014">{{cite web|last=Ivan |first=Arthur |url=http://www.dummymag.com/reviews/album-of-the-week-panda-bear-panda-bear-meets-the-grim-reaper-review |title=Album review: Panda Bear 'Panda Bear Meets The Grim Reaper' |publisher=Dummy Mag |access-date=February 18, 2016}}</ref> and [[indie rock]].<ref name="AMbio" /> Lennox's debut album ''[[Panda Bear (album)|Panda Bear]]'' was released in 1999 on [[Paw Tracks|Soccer Star Records]]. After focusing more on touring and recording with [[Animal Collective]], he released the follow-up ''[[Young Prayer]]'' in 2004 and the highly acclaimed third solo album ''[[Person Pitch]]'' in 2007.  Of his songwriting style, Lennox says "I get impatient writing songs, I can't spend more than a couple of hours before I get frustrated. So I got to kind of spit it out real fast. My favorite songs are the ones where I worked really really fast on, when it comes all out in like two hours or something."<ref name="mafama"/>

Panda Bear's fourth album, [[Tomboy (album)|''Tomboy'']], was released April 12, 2011, on his own label, Paw Tracks. He started performing material from ''Tomboy'' on December 5, 2008, at a show with [[No Age]] in Miami, Florida. During a brief European tour in January 2010, he played three shows consisting almost entirely of new material. On March 7, 2010, a tour setlist with titles for ten of the new songs was posted on Panda Bear's [[MySpace]] blog. He also played [[Primavera Sound Festival]] in 2010. The single "Tomboy" and the b-side "Slow Motion" were released in July 2010. It was announced in August that singles "You Can Count on Me" and "Alsatian Darn" would be released via Domino on September 28. The limited 500 copies of "You Can Count On Me" sold out in less than a day. The single "Last Night at the Jetty" was released December 2010. The single "Surfer's Hymn" was released March 28, 2011.

[[File:Panda Bear, Paris.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Lennox performs in Paris in 2010]]
His song "Comfy In Nautica" appears in ABC's 2010 global warming movie ''[[Earth 2100]]''.

Lennox was chosen by [[Jeff Mangum]] of [[Neutral Milk Hotel]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|All Tomorrow's Parties]] festival he planned to curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atpfestival.com/events/jeffmangum.php|title=ATP curated by Jeff Mangum (Neutral Milk Hotel) – All Tomorrow's Parties|publisher=Atpfestival.com|access-date=January 14, 2015}}</ref> However, Lennox was unable to play when the event was rescheduled to March 2012.

In June 2013, Panda Bear performed a set of all new material at ATP. In October 2014, the ''Mr Noah'' EP was released, featuring four new songs. The full album, ''[[Panda Bear Meets the Grim Reaper]]'', was released in January 2015.

In 2018, Lennox released the vinyl-only ''A Day With the Homies'' EP, a collection of five songs heavily influenced by house + bass music. Included on the packaging of the release were hidden URLs that pointed to samples used on the EP. In February 2019, he released the LP ''Buoys'', featuring production work by longtime collaborator Rusty Santos. It was preceded by the single "Dolphin".

===Outside musical collaborations===

==Personal life==
In 2004, Lennox moved from New York City to [[Lisbon]], Portugal. He first visited the city for a vacation following a long [[Animal Collective]] tour in 2003. Lennox says about Lisbon: "Since I got off the airplane here [for the first time] I had a good feeling about this place." He met his wife, the fashion designer Fernanda Pereira, there; after visiting each other in Lisbon and New York, Lennox decided to move to Europe because he also felt "connected to the European way of life",<ref name="mafama"/> considering himself as a "slow moving kind of person" and Lisbon as a "slow moving kind of place".<ref name="mafama"/> Lennox and Pereira have a daughter, Nadja, born in 2005<ref>Kelly, Jennifer.
