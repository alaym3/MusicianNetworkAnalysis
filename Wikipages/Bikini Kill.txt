'''Bikini Kill''' is an American [[punk rock]] band formed in [[Olympia, Washington]], in October 1990. The group consists of singer and songwriter [[Kathleen Hanna]], guitarist [[Billy Karren]], bassist [[Kathi Wilcox]], and drummer [[Tobi Vail]]. The band pioneered the [[riot grrrl]] movement, with [[radical feminist]] lyrics and fiery performances. Their music is characteristically abrasive and [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]-influenced. After two full-length albums, several EPs and two compilations, they disbanded in 1997. The band reunited for tours in 2019 and 2020.

==Career==
Bikini Kill formed in [[Olympia, Washington]], in October 1990, by [[Kathleen Hanna]] (vocals), [[Billy Karren]] (guitar), [[Kathi Wilcox]] (bass), and [[Tobi Vail]] (drums). Hanna, Vail, and Wilcox met while attending [[The Evergreen State College]] in Washington.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Bikini Kill Biography|url = https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography|website = Rolling Stone|access-date = 2015-12-04|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151209010818/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography|archive-date = 2015-12-09|url-status = dead}}</ref> Hanna also published a [[fanzine]] called ''Bikini Kill'' for their first tours in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography|title=Bikini Kill Biography|work=Rolling Stone|access-date=April 15, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151209010818/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/bikini-kill/biography|archive-date=December 9, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The band wrote songs together and encouraged a female-centric environment at their shows, urging women to come to the front of the stage and handing out lyric sheets to them. Hanna would also dive into the crowd to personally remove male hecklers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title = What happens when a riot grrrl grows up?|url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/09/kathleen-hanna-the-julie-ruin-bikini-kill-interview|website = the Guardian|access-date = 2015-12-04|first = Emma|last = Brockes}}</ref> Such male concertgoers would often verbally and physically assault Hanna during shows when the tickets were still inexpensive and easily procured.<ref name=":0" /> However, the band's reach included large male audiences as well as young women.<ref name=":0" />

Fellow [[riot grrrl]] musician [[Lois Maffeo]] originally adopted Bikini Kill as a band name, inspired by the 1967 B-movie ''[[The Million Eyes of Sumuru]]''. She and her friend Margaret Doherty used the name for a one-off performance in the late 1980s where they donned [[fake fur|faux fur]] punk cave girl costumes. Vail liked the name and appropriated it after Maffeo settled on the band name Cradle Robbers.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Sara|title=Girls to the Front: The True Story of the Riot Grrrl Revolution|year=2010|publisher=HarperPerennial|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-180636-0|pages=46–47|edition=1st}}</ref>

After an independent demo cassette, ''[[Revolution Girl Style Now]]'', Bikini Kill released the ''[[Bikini Kill (EP)|Bikini Kill]]'' EP on the [[indie label]] [[Kill Rock Stars]].  [[Record producer|Produced]] by [[Ian MacKaye]] of [[Minor Threat]] and [[Fugazi]], the album began to establish the band's audience. The band's debut album, ''[[Pussy Whipped]]'', was released in September 1993. Bikini Kill toured in [[London]], [[England]] to begin working with [[Huggy Bear (band)|Huggy Bear]], releasing a split album, ''Our Troubled Youth'' / ''[[Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah]]'', and touring the UK. The tour was the subject of a documentary film by [[Lucy Thane]] titled ''It Changed My Life: Bikini Kill in the U.K.'' Upon their return to the United States, the band began working with [[Joan Jett]] of [[the Runaways]], whose music Hanna described as an early example of the Riot Grrrl aesthetic. Jett produced the single "New Radio"/[[Rebel Girl (Bikini Kill song)|"Rebel Girl"]] for the band, and Hanna co-wrote several songs on Jett's ''[[Pure and Simple (Joan Jett album)|Pure and Simple]]'' album.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daly|first=Steve|date=March 24, 1994|title=Joan Jett Lives Up to Her Bad Reputation|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/joan-jett-lives-up-to-her-bad-reputation-19940324|journal=Rolling Stone}}</ref>

By the following year, [[Riot Grrrl]] was receiving constant attention in the media, and Bikini Kill were increasingly referred to as pioneers of the movement. Hanna called for a "[[media blackout]]" amongst Riot Grrrls, as they felt the band and the movement were being misrepresented by the media.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/11/29/kathleen-hanna-punk_n_4351163.html|title=Punk Icon Kathleen Hanna Brings Riot Grrl Back To The Spotlight|last=Brooks|first=Katherine|date=2013-11-29|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-01-23|language=en-US}}</ref> The pioneer reputation endures but, as Hanna recalls, "[Bikini Kill was] very vilified during the '90s by so many people, and hated by so many people, and I think that that's been kind of written out of the history. People were throwing chains at our heads – people hated us – and it was really, really hard to be in that band."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Burbank |first=Megan |date=April 22, 2015 |title=Rebel Girl, Redux |url=http://www.portlandmercury.com/portland/rebel-girl/Content?oid=15463567 |newspaper=Portland Mercury |location=Portland, OR |access-date=February 5, 2017 }}</ref>

The band's final album, ''[[Reject All American]]'', was released in 1996. After the band's breakup in 1997, a compilation of singles recorded between 1993 and 1995 was released in 1998 under the name ''[[The Singles (Bikini Kill album)|The Singles]]''.<ref>{{allmusicguide |id=R352148 |label=''The Singles (Bikini Kill)''}}</ref>

==Post-breakup==
During the summer of 1992, the band [[The Frumpies]] was formed by Karren, Wilcox, Vail, and [[Molly Neuman]] of [[Bratmobile]], and toured as late as the early 2000s along with a similar Italian punk rock band [[Dada Swing]].<ref>[http://www.killrockstars.com/bands/frumpies/index.html "Frumpies News of April 2000"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031033908/http://www.killrockstars.com/bands/frumpies/index.html |date=2006-10-31 }}.

Vail, notorious for her numerous [[side project]]s and being in several bands at a time, later resurfaced in a band called Spider and the Webs, and played with [[the Old Haunts]] until the band broke up in 2009. Kathi Wilcox played in The Casual Dots, who released only one album to date,<ref>{{cite web|last=Pearis|first=Bill|title=The Casual Dots (members of Bikini Kill, Slant 6) regrouping for shows in NYC, DC & Baltimore|url=https://www.brooklynvegan.com/the-casual-dots/|work=[[Brooklyn Vegan]]|date=January 7, 2016|access-date=June 30, 2021}}</ref> and Billy Karren played in Ghost Mom. Hanna first contributed to an LP called 'Real Fiction' as a member of the Fakes, and then turned to more dance-based [[new wave music]] (with similar feminist lyrical themes) on her solo debut, ''[[Julie Ruin]]''. She then became a member of the political new wave outfit [[Le Tigre]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Martin |url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/music/review/1999/11/11/tigre |title=Sharps & Flats - Music |work=Salon.com |access-date=2011-10-30}}</ref> After Le Tigre broke up, Hanna became the front woman of a band named after her solo project, the Julie Ruin, for which Wilcox plays bass.

In February 2016, a pro-[[Hillary Clinton]] clip utilizing the Bikini Kill song "Rebel Girl" began to go viral, but was taken down by Vail (who supported [[Bernie Sanders]] in the primary).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/282210/tobi-vail-copyright-infringement-notice-hillary-clinton-rebel-girl-video/|title=Death And Taxes - SPIN|website=www.deathandtaxesmag.com|access-date=9 April 2018}}</ref>
