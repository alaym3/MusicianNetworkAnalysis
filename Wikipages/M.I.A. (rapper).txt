(an acronym of "Missing in [[Acton, London|Acton]]"), is a British rapper, singer, record producer and activist. Her songs contain evocative political and social commentary regarding immigration, warfare and identity in a globalised world. Her music combines elements of [[alternative music|alternative]], [[electronic dance|dance]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] and [[world music]] with eclectic instruments and samples.

Born in London to [[Sri Lankan Tamils|Sri Lankan Tamil]] parents, M.I.A. and her family moved to [[Jaffna]] in [[Northern Province, Sri Lanka|northern Sri Lanka]] when she was six months old. As a child, she experienced displacement caused by the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]], which made the family return to London as [[refugee]]s when M.I.A. was 11 years old; the war had a defining influence on M.I.A.'s artistry. She started out as a visual artist, filmmaker and designer in 2000, and began her recording career in 2002. One of the first acts to come to public attention through the [[Internet]],<ref>{{Cite web|title=How M.I.A.

M.I.A.'s first two albums, ''[[Arular]]'' (2005) and ''[[Kala (album)|Kala]]'' (2007), received widespread critical acclaim for their experimentation with hip hop and electronic fusion. The single "[[Paper Planes (M.I.A. song)|Paper Planes]]" from ''Kala'' reached number four on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and sold over four million copies. Her third album ''[[Maya (M.I.A. album)|Maya]]'' (2010) was preceded by the controversial single-[[short film]] "[[Born Free (music video)|Born Free]]". ''Maya'' was her best-charting effort, reaching the top 10 on several charts. Her fourth studio album, ''[[Matangi (album)|Matangi]]'' (2013), included the single "[[Bad Girls (M.I.A. song)|Bad Girls]]", which won accolades at the [[2012 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Awards]]. M.I.A. released her fifth studio album, ''[[AIM (album)|AIM]]'', in 2016. She scored her first ''Billboard'' Hot 100 number-one single as a featured artist on [[Travis Scott]]'s "[[Franchise (song)|Franchise]]" (2020).

During the civil war, soldiers would put guns through holes in the windows and shoot at the school, which she notes as "fun."<ref name="MIAhightimesinterview" /> Her classmates were trained to dive under the table or run next door to English-language schools that, according to her, "wouldn't get shot."<ref name="MIAhightimesinterview" /> Arulpragasam lived on a road alongside much of her extended family and played inside temples and churches in the town.

Arulpragasam has had a difficult relationship with her father, due to his political activities in the 1980s and complete absence during much of her life.

While attending [[Central St Martins College]], Arulpragasam wanted to make films and art depicting [[Realism (arts)|realism]] that would be accessible to everyone, something that she felt was missing from her classmates' ethics and the course criteria.

===Themes and artwork===
M.I.A. has become known for integrating her imagery of political violence with her music videos and her cover art. Her politically inspired art became recognised while she exhibited and published several of her brightly coloured stencils and paintings portraying the tiger, a symbol of [[Tamil nationalism]], ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka and urban Britain in the early 2000s. Lyrics on ''[[Arular]]'' regarding her experiences of identity politics, poverty, revolution, gender and sexual stereotypes, war, and the conditions of working class in London were hailed as new and unorthodox, setting her apart from previous artists.<ref name="rebelyellmia" /><ref name="mmmia" /> The album references the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]] and the [[Sri Lankan Tamil nationalism|Tamil independence movements]] and features [[culture jamming]], [[Multilingualism|multi-lingual]] slang, strident and subtle imagery. Her albums' social commentary and storytelling have incited debate on the "invigoratingly complex" politics of the issues she highlighted in the album, breaking taboos while the [[Western world|West]] was engaged in the [[Iraq War|2003 Iraq War]] in the Middle East during the [[Presidency of George W.

==Legacy==
Music culture writer Michael Meyer said that M.I.A.'s record imagery, lyrical booklets, homepages and videos supported the "image of provocation yet also avoidance of, or inability to use consistent images and messages." Instead of catering to stereotypes, he felt that M.I.A. "played with them" creating an uncategorisable and hence unsettling result.<ref name="mmmia" /> Critic Zach Baron felt that it had been shown in her career that M.I.A. had "always been adept at using a larger force against itself."<ref>{{cite web|author=Baron, Zach|date=22 June 2010|title=The education of Maya Arulpragasam|url=http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/culture/2010/06/117964/education-maya-arulpragasam?page=all|access-date=6 January 2012|work=Capital New York}}</ref> M.I.A. has been hailed as demonstrating dislocation to be a "productive site of departure" and praised for her ability to transform such a "disadvantage" into a creative form of expression.<ref name="ariyammia" />

Regarding her first two albums, ''Arular'' and ''Kala'', ''[[PopMatters]]'' writer Rob Wheaton felt M.I.A. subverted the "abstract, organized, refined" distilling of violence in Western popular music and imagination and made her work represent much of the developing world's decades-long experiences of "arbitrary, unannounced, and spectacular" slaughter, deeming her work an "assault" with realism.<ref name="popmattMay052" /> Frank Guan of [[Vulture magazine|Vulture]] said that ''Kala'' "sounded like the future" and that "M.I.A.'s immediate influence was remarkable", as the album "seems to herald certain trends current in contemporary hip-hop". Guan further gave appraisal to M.I.A. for being the "precursor" for "fashion-rap" acts, including [[Travis Scott]], [[Lil Uzi Vert]], [[Playboi Carti]], and [[ASAP Rocky]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Guan|first=Frank|date=8 August 2017|title=10 Years After Its Release, M.I.A.'s Kala Is a Reflection of a Different World|url=https://www.vulture.com/2017/08/review-m-i-a-s-album-kala-at-ten.html|access-date=6 May 2020|website=Vulture}}</ref> Writing for [[Dazed Digital|''Dazed'' Digital]], Grant Rinder praised the album for transforming M.I.A. from a "cult hero" to an "international star". Rinder commented that the album was a "tremendous" step forward towards shedding light on the realities of [[Third World]] countries that the [[Western world]] may not have thoroughly understood. Reflecting on diversity and representation issues in society, as well as politics surrounding [[President of the United States|President]] [[Donald Trump]], Rinder said that ''Kala'' "feels particularly ahead of its time", and concluded that "M.I.A. was truly a pioneer for a global humanitarian perspective that no artist has been able to deliver quite as well since."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Dazed|date=8 August 2017|title=Looking back at the passion and politics of M.I.A.'s Kala|url=https://www.dazeddigital.com/music/article/37006/1/mia-kala-10-year-retrospective|access-date=6 May 2020|website=Dazed}}</ref>

Some detractors criticised M.I.A. early in her music career for "using radical chic" and for her attendance of an art school.<ref name="ftguard05" /> Critic [[Simon Reynolds]], writing in ''The Village Voice'' in 2005 saw this as a lack of authenticity and felt M.I.A. was "a veritable vortex of discourse, around most likely irresolvable questions concerning authenticity, post-colonialism, and dilettantism". He continued that while swayed by her chutzpah and ability to deliver live, he "was also turned off by the stencil-sprayed projection imagery of grenades, tanks, and so forth (redolent of the Clash with their strife-torn Belfast stage backdrops and [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] cred by association)" while the "99 percent white audience punched the air", admonishing what he perceived as a "lack of local character" to her debut album.<ref>{{cite web|author=Reynolds, Simon|title=Piracy Funds What?|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-02-15/music/piracy-funds-what/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=15 January 2005|access-date=16 September 2010}}</ref>

Critic [[Robert Christgau]] described Reynolds' argument as "cheap tack" in another article written in the publication, stating M.I.A's experiences connected her to world poverty in a way "few Western whites can grasp". He questioned why M.I.A.'s 2001 Alternative Turner Prize nominated images of pastel-washed tigers, soldiers, guns, armoured vehicles, and fleeing civilians that bedeck M.I.A.'s albums and videos were not assumed or analysed as being incendiary propaganda, suggesting that unlike art buyers, rock and roll fans were "assumed to be stupid".<ref>{{cite web|author=Christgau, Rob|title=Burning Bright|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2005-02-22/music/burning-bright/|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=22 February 2005|access-date=16 September 2010}}</ref> Reynolds later argued that M.I.A. was the "Artist of the Decade" in a 2009 issue of ''The Guardian''.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Reynolds, Simon|title=Notes on the noughties: Is MIA artist of the decade?|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2009/dec/16/mia-artist-of-the-decade|date=16 December 2009|access-date=16 September 2010}}</ref>

And they use me as a puppet to explain that to you, that only people who, you know, have a PhD in this shit are allowed to talk about this. Or that only politicians are allowed to talk about politics, and that's why we're fucked, because the cycle is constantly kept within that fucking framework. There aren't more people standing up and telling their personal experience ... if a normal civilian comes up and says 'Hey, this happened in my village and I'm not happy about it', we're not allowed to talk about it. You have to follow this bureaucratic bullshit to get any sort of action, and it's all part of this cycle. Like back in the day, we had ideals of revolution and fighting back, and most of the time that shit starts with individual people having personal relationships, these experiences. And now it's so disconnected and the media can paint a picture for you ... they make so much bureaucracy and politics, and I think taking away the personal aspects, the human aspects of these political issues is really wrong. Whether it's the floods, or starving people in Africa, or whatever.
