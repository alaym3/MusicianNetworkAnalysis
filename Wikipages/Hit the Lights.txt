==History==
===Formation and ''Until We Get Caught'' EP (2003–2005)===
Hit the Lights formed in 2003. During the band's documentary "Vultures Don't Eat Vans," the band dispelled rumors that their name was taken from a [[Metallica]] song. Band members Colin Ross and Omar Zehery first played in a local band The Goodbye Session. Nick Thompson originally was in a group called The Summer Departure and Nate Van Dame had worked for [[Hawthorne Heights]] as a drum tech.  The band released their first EP, Leaving Town Tonight, in 2004.  In March 2005, Hit the Lights recorded and released the EP ''Until We Get Caught'' on Silent Movie Records.  The band signed to [[Triple Crown Records]] which reissued ''Until We Get Caught'' in November 2005.<ref>{{cite web|author=Hit the Lights |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/hit-the-lights-mn0000325604 |title=Hit the Lights &#124; Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2014-05-06}}</ref>

===''This Is a Stick Up... Don't Make It a Murder'' (2006–2007)===
Hit the Lights headlined the Let It Ride Tour in 2007 which featured support from [[Just Surrender]], [[All Time Low]], [[Valencia (band)|Valencia]], [[Forgive Durden]], The Secret Handshake, and Love Arcade.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=206347 |title=Correct Let It Ride Tour Dates With Hit The Lights - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=2014-05-06}}</ref>  Lead singer Colin Ross stated that he could no longer be a part of the band because his heart just was not in it. The other members said they noticed that Ross did not seem to be as into performing and being part of the band the better part of the last year.  They were slated to embark on a headlining tour in the [[United Kingdom]] in October 2007, but had to cancel due to not being able to find a permanent lead vocalist after Colin Ross left in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=248464 |title=Vocalist For Hit The Lights Leaves Band - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=2014-05-06}}</ref>  Colin performed his last show with the band on September 15, 2007, at The Axis in Lima, Ohio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.absolutepunk.net/showthread.php?t=262963 |title=Hit The Lights Announce Last Show With Colin - News Article |publisher=AbsolutePunk.net |access-date=2014-05-06}}</ref>  After that show, the remaining four members went into recording and recorded a cover, "The Warrior", with Nick Thompson on lead vocals.

===''Skip School Start Fights'' and ''Coast to Coast'' EP (2008–2009)===
The band posted a new demo entitled "Stay Out", on January 31, 2008. Notably, their first single without former lead vocalist Colin Ross. On February 19, 2008, they announced that guitarist/backing vocalist Nick Thompson was taking over the lead vocalist role for the band.  On July 8, 2008, Hit the Lights released their second full length titled ''[[Skip School, Start Fights]]''. The band shot a music video for the song "Stay Out" in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] on May 27, 2008. The band shot a music video for single "Drop The Girl" on October 6, 2008 in [[Van Nuys]], [[California]]. The video includes ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' star [[Heather Morris (actress)|Heather Morris]] in a small role. On June 23, 2009 Hit the lights released [[Coast to Coast (Hit the Lights EP)|Coast to Coast]] which featured 2 new songs, 2 cover songs, and two acoustic tracks.  The band embarked on the 2009 [[Warped Tour]].  At Cincinnati stop of the Warped Tour, former vocalist Colin Ross joined Hit the Lights on stage for the song "Bodybag".

===Signing with Universal Republic and ''Invicta'' EP and ''Invicta'' (2010–2012)===
In April 2010 Hit The Lights toured Australia with [[New Found Glory]] and [[Fireworks (punk band)|Fireworks]].  Hit the Lights had fulfilled their contract obligations with Triple Crown Records and began looking for a new label.  After a bidding war in March 2010, they announced that they had signed with Universal Republic Records, in partnership with Vagrant Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/exclusive_hit_the_lights_sign_to_universal_republic_to_release_album_n |title=Alternative Press |publisher=Altpress.com |date=2010-08-24 |access-date=2014-05-06}}</ref>  Hit the Lights worked to write their major label debut, but became increasingly frustrated from the lack of feedback and the desire from the label for them to write Top 40 Radio hits.  During this time, Universal Republic experienced significant restructuring and in May 2011 Hit the Lights asked for release from their contract, which was granted.  On June 1, 2011 Hit the Lights entered the studio to begin recording their new record.<ref name=poz>[http://propertyofzack.com/post/6219388504/hit-the-lights-discuss-collaborations-on-new-album PropertyOfZack<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Guitarist Omar has said that they have collaborated with Ryan Key from [[Yellowcard]], Tim Pagnotta from [[Sugarcult]], and Kenny Vasoli from [[The Starting Line]].
