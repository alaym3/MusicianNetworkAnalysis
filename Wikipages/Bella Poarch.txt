== Early life ==
Poarch was born in the [[Philippines]]<ref name="vogue">{{cite web |url=https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-poarch-music-mental-health-interview |title=TikTok Star-Turned-Musician Bella Poarch on the Impossibility of Beauty Standards and the Value of Therapy |last=Collin |first=Hattie |date=May 14, 2021 |website=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] |access-date=May 15, 2021 |archive-date=May 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514174254/https://www.vogue.com/article/bella-poarch-music-mental-health-interview |url-status=live }}</ref> to [[Filipinos|Filipino]] biological parents.

In an interview, she recounts that she and her adopted brother were heavily abused all throughout her childhood, up until her enrollment in the military.<ref name=":0">{{Citation|title=Bella Poarch - H3 Podcast # 247|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2jFIQr_cVz4|language=en|access-date=June 18, 2021}}</ref> She lived on a [[farm]] with her family: two older (adopted) sisters, her adoptive parents, and her brother. She had many of the responsibilities for the farm, even as young as seven years old. She recounts that her adoptive sisters did not receive the same treatment as her. Poarch says that her father was verbally and physically abusive, while her mother did not get involved. Her family (except her two older sisters who still reside in the Philippines) moved to San Francisco to live with her aunt for a couple of months, before the family moved to Texas when she was 13<ref name="vogue" /> due to her father's need for bypass surgery. She says that the abuse decreased here, but she still faced some mental abuse from her father at home.<ref name=":0" />

== Musical career ==
[[File:Bella Poarch adjusting hair.jpg|thumb|Poarch shows her Tik-Tok makeup routine for ''Vogue'' Taiwan in 2019.]]
In January 2020, Poarch created her [[TikTok]] account. She started actively posting on TikTok based on gaming and cosplay content in April 2020. She gained notability in August 2020, when her lip sync videos went viral, most notably her video where she is lip-syncing to "Sophie Aspin Send" by Millie B. The zoomed-in video of her lip-syncing to that tune and rhythmically bouncing went viral and became one of TikTok's most liked videos of all time. Following her TikTok success, she launched a [[YouTube]] channel and [[Twitter]] page in the months after she joined TikTok.
 
Poarch is also associated with her alpaca stuffed toy.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=First time you can see Paca|url=https://vm.tiktok.com/ZS4RvGUC/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=TikTok where Paca is directly referred to|url=https://vm.tiktok.com/ZS4R7scn/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=}}</ref> In 2020, she released a limited clothing line RIPNDIP x Paca Collaboration.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=RIPNDIP x Paca clothing collaboration|url=https://www.ripndipclothing.com/collections/ripndip-x-paca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514153057/https://www.ripndipclothing.com/collections/ripndip-x-paca|archive-date=May 14, 2021|access-date=|website=}}</ref>

In December 2020, Poarch's rising popularity peaked when she reportedly grabbed the interest of two large professional Esports organizations – [[100 Thieves]] and [[FaZe Clan]], which apparently showed interest in her, a live streamer and gamer at the time, as a content creator under their respective banners.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Mehta|first=Aryan|date=February 4, 2021|title=From Navy Vet to TikTok: The Story of Bella Poarch's Military Service and Subsequent Fame|url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/from-navy-vet-tiktok-the-story-bella-poarch-s-military-service-subsequent-fame|access-date=June 7, 2021|website=www.sportskeeda.com|language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|title=100 Thieves AND FaZe Clan Interest in Bella Poarch Tik Tok Star|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mXN0NyMPPk|language=en|access-date=June 7, 2021}}</ref> In May 2021, Poarch signed a record deal with [[Warner Records]].

== Personal life ==
Poarch has publicly expressed her support in the fight against anti-Asian racism because of the rise in hate crimes towards the Asian-American community. On March 19, 2021, she uploaded a video to TikTok to speak on the topic and spread the message.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bella Poarch on TikTok|url=https://m.tiktok.com/v/6941545848572546309.html?_r=1|access-date=May 18, 2021|website=TikTok|archive-date=May 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210518152543/https://m.tiktok.com/v/6941545848572546309.html?_r=1|url-status=live}}</ref> She also shared her experiences with ''Vogue'', saying that she can relate to this situation because she has been "treated differently" and "randomly attacked and assaulted" as an Asian teen after moving to the U.S. from the Philippines.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Vogue|title=Bella Poarch, Lastlings, Saweetie and Shawn Wasabi speak out on anti-Asian racism, fetishization and representation|url=https://www.vogue.in/culture-and-living/content/bella-poarch-saweetie-shawn-wasabi-and-lastlings-speak-out-about-anti-asian-racism-fetishisation-and-representation|access-date=May 18, 2021|website=Vogue India|date=April 13, 2021|language=en-IN|archive-date=May 18, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210518153701/https://www.vogue.in/culture-and-living/content/bella-poarch-saweetie-shawn-wasabi-and-lastlings-speak-out-about-anti-asian-racism-fetishisation-and-representation|url-status=live}}</ref>

Poarch was [[Anti-Korean sentiment##CancelKorea|criticized]] for having a tattoo similar to the [[Rising Sun Flag]] in her videos. The specific tattoo resembled a symbol of [[List of territories occupied by Imperial Japan|Japanese imperialism]] which may be considered offensive to some Southeast and East Asians. In September 2020, she apologized and immediately had it covered.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jun-tae |first1=Ko |title=Racist remarks on Filipinos stir anger on social media |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200913000036 |access-date=June 9, 2021 |work=Korea Herald |date=September 13, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210406040410/http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200913000036 |archive-date=April 6, 2021}}</ref>
