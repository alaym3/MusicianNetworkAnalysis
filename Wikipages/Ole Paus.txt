'''Ole Paus''' (born 9 February 1947; full name ''Ole Christian Paus'') is a [[Norway|Norwegian]] singer, songwriter, poet and author, who is widely regarded as the foremost troubadour of the contemporary [[Scandinavian ballad tradition|Norwegian ballad tradition]] ({{lang-no|visebølgen}}).<ref name=snl>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ole Paus |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]] |editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget |location=Oslo  |url=http://www.snl.no/Ole_Paus |language=no | access-date=4 May 2010 }}</ref> During the 1970s Paus was known for his biting social commentary, especially in his ironic and sometimes libellous "musical newspapers" in the form of [[broadside ballads]] in a series of albums titled "The Paus Post". He has later become known for a softer and more lyrical style, and has written some of Norway's best known songs, such as "[[Innerst i sjelen]]" and "[[Engler i sneen]]". He has often collaborated with [[Ketil Bjørnstad]], notably on the "modern [[Suite (music)|suite]]" ''[[Leve Patagonia]]''; he has later collaborated with [[Kirkelig Kulturverksted]] on several projects, and with his son, the classical composer [[Marcus Paus]], notably on the children's opera ''[[The Witches (opera)|The Witches]]'' and several later works. One of his songs, "[[Mitt lille land]]", gained wide popularity after the [[2011 Norway attacks]] and was described as "the new national anthem". He has been described as the Norwegian counterpart of [[Bob Dylan]] and as the "voice of the nation."<ref>[https://scandinaviantraveler.com/dk/mennesker/ole-paus-blev-nationens-stemme Ole Paus blev Nationens stemme]</ref> Paus was discovered by artists [[Alf Cranner]] and [[Alf Prøysen]], and was mentored by [[André Bjerke]], [[Jens Bjørneboe]] and [[Henny Moan]]. Paus is noted for his consistent use of Norwegian and has been eager for other Norwegian musicians to switch from English to Norwegian.

==Background==
He is the son of General [[Ole Otto Paus]] and a member of the [[Paus]] family. He is the father of composer [[Marcus Paus]].

==Work==
Ole Paus debuted as a singer-songwriter in 1970 and as an author the following year, after he was discovered by [[Alf Cranner]] and [[Alf Prøysen]], respectively. He was one of the central figures of the so-called ''[[visebølgen i Norge]]'', i.e. troubadours in the tradition of [[Evert Taube]], [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]] and others.
