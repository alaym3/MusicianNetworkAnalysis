'''Martin David Robinson''' (September 26, 1925&nbsp;– December 8, 1982), known professionally as '''Marty Robbins''', was an American singer, songwriter, actor, multi-instrumentalist, and [[NASCAR]] [[racing driver]]. Robbins was one of the most popular and successful [[Country music|country and western]] singers for most of his nearly four-decade career,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/marty-robbins-mn0000858710/biography |title=Marty Robbins Biography |publisher=AllMusic, RhythmOne, LLC |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/marty-robbins-20651271#mainstream-success |title=Marty Robbins Biography |publisher=A&E Television Networks, LLC |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmt.com/artists/marty-robbins/biography/ |title=About Marty Robbins |publisher=Country Music Television, Inc., a division of Viacom International Inc. |access-date=2016-12-29}}</ref> which spanned from the late 1940s to the early 1980s. He was also an early [[outlaw country]] pioneer.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Max|date=2018|title=Down in the Hole: Outlaw Country and Outlaw Culture|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/scu.2018.0034|journal=Southern Cultures|volume=24|issue=3|pages=83–100|doi=10.1353/scu.2018.0034|s2cid=149612754|issn=1534-1488}}</ref>

Born in [[Glendale, Arizona]], Robbins taught himself guitar while serving in the [[United States Navy]] during [[World War II]], and subsequently drew fame performing in clubs in and around his hometown. In 1956, he released his first No. 1 country song, "[[Singing the Blues]]" and one year later, released two more No. 1 hits, "[[A White Sport Coat]]" and "[[The Story of My Life (Marty Robbins song)|The Story of My Life]]". In 1959, Robbins released his signature song, "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", for which he won the [[Grammy Award for Best Country & Western Recording]]. The song began Robbins' association with [[Western music (North America)|western]] balladry, a style which would become a staple of his career. Later releases that drew critical acclaim include "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]", "[[Big Iron]]" and "Honkytonk Man", the last for which the [[Honkytonk Man|1982 Clint Eastwood film]] is named, and in which Robbins made his final appearance before death.

Over the course of his career, Robbins recorded more than [[Marty Robbins discography|500 songs and 60 albums]], and won two [[Grammy Awards]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] and [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]], and was named the 1960s Artist of the Decade by the [[Academy of Country Music]]. Robbins was a commercial success in both the country and pop genres, and his songs were covered by many other famous artists, including [[Johnny Cash]], the [[Grateful Dead]] and [[Elvis Presley]]. His music continues to have an influence in pop culture today, having recently appeared in several contemporary pop culture features, including the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]'', and the series finale of [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]]'s ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.

==Biography==
[[File:Glendale-Catlin Court-F.M. Staggs House-1919 001.jpg|250px|thumb|The F.M. Staggs/ Marty Robbins House in Glendale, Arizona]]
Robbins was born in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], a suburb of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], Marty’s father was of Polish descent. Marty’s mother was of approximately three eighths Scottish, one quarter German, one eighth English, and likely one quarter Irish, ancestry.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pruett | first = Barbara J. | title = Marty Robbins: Fast Cars and Country Music | year = 2007 | isbn = 9780810860360 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=otDFSIwdsSIC&pg=PA522 | access-date = 2014-04-24}}</ref> Robbins grew up in a difficult family situation. His father took odd jobs to support the family of 10 children; however, his hard drinking led to divorce in 1937. Among his warmer memories of his childhood, Robbins recalled having listened to stories of the [[American West]] told by his maternal grandfather, Texas Bob Heckle, who was a local [[medicine man]].<ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Rhymes of the Frontier|date=1929|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPxoHAAACAAJ|access-date=2014-10-25|last1=" Heckle|first1="Texas Bob}}</ref> At 17, Robbins left his troubled home to serve in the [[United States Navy]] as an [[Landing craft tank|LCT]] [[coxswain]] during [[World War II]]. He was stationed in the [[Solomon Islands]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. To pass the time during the war, he learned to play the guitar, started writing songs,<ref name=pc10/> and came to love [[Hawaiian music]].

Robbins married Marizona "Mari" Baldwin (1930 - 2001) <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Baldwin-13936|title=Marizona (Baldwin) Robbins (1930-2001) &#124; WikiTree FREE Family Tree}}</ref> on September 27, 1948. They had two children, Ronny and Janet, and were married 34 years until his death.

After his [[Military discharge|discharge]] from the military in 1947 and his marriage the following year, Robbins began to play at local [[Music venue|venues]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],<ref name=pc10/> then moved on to [[Host (radio)|host]] his own show on [[KIHP (AM)|KTYL]] and then his own television show on [[KPHO|KPHO-TV]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. After [[Little Jimmy Dickens]] made a [[guest appearance]] on Robbins' TV show, Dickens got Robbins a [[record deal]] with [[Columbia Records]].

Robbins became known for his appearances at the [[Grand Ole Opry]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]], [[Tennessee]]. Music journalist [[Mary Harron]] wrote the following about him in ''The Guardian'':<ref>{{Cite web| title = Marty Robbins: Country Dude of Nashville. By Mary Harron : Articles, reviews and interviews from Rock's Backpages.| access-date = 2018-06-25| url = https://www.rocksbackpages.com/Library/Article/marty-robbins-country-dude-of-nashville |via=[[Rock's Backpages]] |url-access=subscription }}</ref>
<blockquote>Robbins was a symbol of the Nashville establishment that younger [[Country music|country]] fans abandoned in the Seventies for the bleached-denim "[[outlaw country|outlaw school]]" of [[Waylon Jennings]] and [[Willie Nelson]]. Robbins belonged to the [[Jim Reeves]] era and wore his embroidered cowboy suits proudly. Best known for the western ballad, ''El Paso'', his career also touched the [[Rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] side of [[Country music|country]] in songs like ''White Sports Coat And A Pink Carnation'', and he kept a touch of the dude about him to the end.</blockquote>

In 1980, Robbins appeared on the [[PBS]] music program ''[[Austin City Limits]]'' (season 5). In addition to his recordings and performances, Robbins was an avid [[race car]] driver, [[Competition|competing]] in 35 career [[NASCAR]] [[Grand National Series]] races with six top-10 finishes,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/driver/Marty_Robbin |title=Career Statistics |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> including the 1973 [[1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400|Firecracker 400]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racing-reference.info/race/1973_Medal_Of_Honor_Firecracker_400/W |title=1973 Medal of Honor Firecracker 400 |publisher=Racing-Reference.info |date=1973-07-04 |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> In 1967, Robbins played himself in the car racing film ''[[Hell on Wheels (1967 film)|Hell on Wheels]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061757/ |publisher=IMDb.com|title=Hell on Wheels|access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> Robbins was partial to [[Dodge]]s prepared by [[NASCAR]] Hall-of-Famer [[Cotton Owens]], and owned and raced [[Dodge Charger|Chargers]] and then a 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]]. He was also the driver of the 60th [[Indianapolis 500]] [[Buick Century]] [[pace car]] in 1976. His last race was in a [[Junior Johnson]]-built 1982 [[Buick Regal]] in the [[Atlanta Journal 500]] on November 7, 1982, a month before his death.

Robbins developed  [[cardiovascular disease]] early in life. After his third heart attack on December 2, 1982, he underwent [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|quadruple coronary bypass surgery]]. He did not recover and died six days later, on December 8, at [[St. Thomas Hospital (Nashville, Tennessee)|St. Thomas Hospital]] in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]].  He was 57 years old.<ref>{{cite news | last = Pareles | first = Jon | date = 1982-12-10 | title = Marty Robbins, Singer, 57; Won a Grammy for 'El Paso' | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1982/12/10/obituaries/marty-robbins-singer-57-won-a-grammy-for-el-paso.html | newspaper = New York Times | location = New York, NY | access-date = 2016-10-12 }}</ref>

==Music and honors==
Although by 1960 Robbins' output was largely country music, his initial hits like "Singing the Blues", "Knee Deep in the Blues", "The Story of My Life", "She Was Only Seventeen", and "[[A White Sport Coat|A White Sport Coat and a Pink Carnation]]" were generally regarded as more pop/teen idol material than his hits from 1960 onwards ("El Paso" etc.). His 1957 recording of "A White Sport Coat and a Pink Carnation"<ref name=pc10>{{Pop Chronicles |10 |2}}</ref> sold over one million copies, and was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold record]].<ref name="The Book of Golden Discs">{{cite book

His musical accomplishments include the [[Grammy Award]] for his 1959 hit and signature song "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", taken from his album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. "El Paso" was his first song to hit No. 1 on the pop chart in the 1960s. It was followed up, successfully, by "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]", which reached No. 3 on the pop chart in 1961, becoming his third, and last, Top 10 pop hit. "El Paso" was followed by one prequel and one sequel: "Feleena (From El Paso)" and "[[El Paso City (song)|El Paso City]]". Also in 1961, Robbins wrote the words and music and recorded "I Told the Brook,"<ref>{{cite book|url=http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/836715 |title=I told the brook [music&#93; / [by&#93; Marty Robbins; arr. by Alec Baynes &#124; National Library of Australia |year=1961 |publisher=Catalogue.nla.gov.au |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref> a ballad later recorded by [[Billy Thorpe]].

He won the [[Grammy Award]] for the Best Country & Western Recording 1961 for his follow-up album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs|More Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', and was awarded the [[Grammy Award]] for Best Country Song in 1970, for "My Woman, My Woman, My Wife". Robbins was named Artist of the Decade (1960–1969) by the [[Academy of Country Music]], was elected to the [[Country Music Hall of Fame]] in 1982, was rewarded three awards at the 17th Annual Music City News Country Awards in 1983, and was given a [[Grammy Hall of Fame Award]] in 1998 for his song "El Paso".

When Robbins was recording his 1961 hit "Don't Worry", session guitarist [[Grady Martin]] accidentally created the electric guitar "[[Distortion (music)|fuzz" effect]]&nbsp;– his six-string bass was run through a faulty channel in a [[mixing console]]. Robbins decided to keep it in the final version.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&q=%22Don't+Worry%22+%22Marty+Robbins%22+distortion&pg=PA75 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins – Diane Diekman – Google Books |date= February 15, 2012|isbn=9780252094200 |access-date=2015-08-17|last1=Diekman |first1=Diane }}</ref> The song reached No. 1 on the country chart, and No. 3 on the pop chart.<ref>Joel Whitburn's Top Country Singles 1944–2001</ref>
Robbins was inducted into the [[Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame]] in 1975. For his contribution to the recording industry, Robbins has a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6666 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

Robbins has been honored by many bands, including the [[Grateful Dead]] who covered "El Paso" and [[Bob Weir]] & Kingfish who covered "Big Iron". [[The Who]]'s 2006 album ''[[Endless Wire (The Who album)|Endless Wire]]'' includes the song "God Speaks of Marty Robbins". The song's composer, [[Pete Townshend]], explained that the song is about God deciding to create the universe just so he can hear some music, "and most of all, one of his best creations, Marty Robbins."<ref>[http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070103040202/http://www.petetownshend.co.uk/diary/display.cfm?id=397&zone=pr |date=January 3, 2007 }}</ref> The [[Beasts of Bourbon]] released a song called "The Day Marty Robbins Died" on their 1984 debut album ''The Axeman's Jazz''. Both [[Frankie Laine]] and [[Elvis Presley]], among others, recorded versions of Robbins' song "[[You Gave Me a Mountain]]", with Laine's recording reaching the pop and adult contemporary charts in 1969. Though Elvis never recorded any of Robbins' songs in the studio, he was a big fan and recorded "You Gave Me a Mountain" live in concert several times; it appeared on 15 Presley albums. [[Johnny Cash]] recorded a version of "[[Big Iron]]" as part of his American Recordings series, which is included in the ''Cash Unearthed'' box set. Cash also recorded other songs by Robbins, including "I Couldn't Keep From Crying", "Kate" and "Song Of The Patriot". He held Robbins in high esteem, having him guest several times on [[The Johnny Cash Show (TV series)|his network TV show]]. "Big Iron" was also covered by [[Mike Ness]] on his album ''[[Under the Influences]]'', on which he paid homage to country music artists. The song, originally released on Robbins' 1959 album ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]'', gained renewed popularity following its use in the video game ''[[Fallout: New Vegas]]''.

His song "El Paso" was featured in the series finale of the [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] TV series ''[[Breaking Bad]]''.  'El Paso' was also featured in the ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'' prequel made by the [[BBC]].

Robbins was awarded an honorary degree by [[Northern Arizona University]].

In 2001, singer-songwriter [[Don Mclean]] released his album, [[Sings Marty Robbins]], which features a collection of songs recorded by Robbins in his career.

In 2016, a portion of Glendale Avenue in Robbins' hometown of [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Arizona]] was renamed "[https://ktar.com/story/1290175/portion-of-glendale-avenue-renamed-for-legendary-country-singer/ Marty Robbins Boulevard]".

== Political views ==
Marty Robbins was strongly [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] in his political views. He supported [[Barry Goldwater]] in his [[1964 United States presidential election]] campaign as a southern director for "Stars for Barry". Two of his songs, "Ain't I Right" and "My Own Native Land" were rejected by Columbia Records as too controversial.{{Citation needed|reason=Need source for reason the songs were rejected.|date=July 2021}}  The lyrics of "Ain't I Right" describe [[Opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-war protesters]] and [[Civil rights movement|civil rights activists]] as [[Communists in the United States|communists]].<ref name="Lyrics2">{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/search?q=Ain%27t+I+Right |website=lyricfind.com |publisher=lyricfind |access-date=22 October 2020 |language=en|title=Ain't I Right?}}</ref>  After Columbia Records rejected the songs, Robbins' band member Bobby Sykes recorded the songs for [[Sims Records]] under the name Johnny Freedom.<ref>{{cite book |last=Diekman |first=Diane |date=2012 |title=Twentieth Century Drifter: The Life of Marty Robbins |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jGbogMkLPLYC&q=marty+robbins+aint+i+right&pg=PA99 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |page=99 |isbn=978-0252081255 }}</ref>

Robbins loved [[NASCAR]] racing.  With his musical successes, he was able to finance his avocation.  Robbins always tried to run at the big race tracks ([[Talladega Superspeedway]], [[Daytona International Speedway]]) every year and a smattering of the smaller races when time permitted. Robbins had 6 top-ten finishes in his career, with a personal best top 5 finish at the 1974 [[Motor State 360]] in Michigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.racing-reference.info/race/1974_Motor_State_360/W |date=June 16, 1974 |title=1974 Motor State 360 |work=racing-reference.info |access-date=February 17, 2021}}</ref>

Robbins' cars were built and maintained by [[Cotton Owens]].  They were painted two-toned magenta and chartreuse, usually carrying car number 42 (though 6, 22, and 777 were also used).  Over the years, he ran a few makes and models ([[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]]s, [[Dodge]]s or [[Ford Motor Company|Fords]]) before buying a 1972-bodied [[Dodge Charger]] from Owens. Robbins had a few major wrecks during the 1970s, and he had Owens rebuild the car to update the sheet metal to the 1973–1974 Charger specifications, and then finally 1978 [[Dodge Magnum]] sheet metal, which he raced until the end of 1980. Robbins' final NASCAR race car was a 1981 [[Buick Regal]] that he rented and drove in a few races in 1981 and 1982.

In 1972, at the [[1972 Winston 500|Winston 500]], Robbins stunned the competition by turning laps that were 15&nbsp;mph faster than his qualifying time. After the race, NASCAR tried to bestow the Rookie of the Race award, but he would not accept it.  He had knocked the [[NASCAR]]-mandated restrictors out of his [[carburetor]] and admitted he "just wanted to see what it was like to run up front for once."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cottonowens.com/drivers/Marty_Robbins.php |title=Cotton Owens Garage – Drivers |publisher=Cotton Owens Garage and Stratatomic LLC |access-date=2015-08-17}}</ref>

Robbins is credited with possibly saving [[Richard Childress]]' life at the 1974 Charlotte 500 by deliberately crashing into a wall rather than t-bone (broadside) Childress's car that was stopped across the track.<ref>{{cite web|title=Marty Robbins Saves Life of NASCAR's Richard Childress|url=http://www.savingcountrymusic.com/marty-robbins-saves-life-of-nascars-richard-childress|website=Savingcountrymusic.com|date=February 22, 2013|access-date=2013-09-11}}</ref>

In 1983, one year after Robbins' death, NASCAR honored him by naming the annual race at [[Fairgrounds Speedway]] the [[Coors 420|Marty Robbins 420]].

Robbins' Dodge Magnum was restored by Owens and donated to the Talladega Museum by his family, and was displayed there from 1983 to 2008.  The car is now in private hands in [[Southern California]] and raced on the Vintage [[NASCAR]] club circuit.

In 2014, Robbins' 1969 [[Dodge Charger Daytona]] was featured on an episode of [[Discovery Channel]]s TV show ''Fat and Furious: Rolling Thunder''. In that same year, an episode of [[Velocity]]'s ''AmeriCarna'' featured ex-race team owner [[Ray Evernham]] spearheading the restoration of another of Robbins' [[NASCAR]] racers, a 1964 [[Plymouth Belvedere]].

For the 2016 [[Darlington, South Carolina|Darlington]] throwback weekend, [[Kyle Larson]]'s No. 42 [[NASCAR]] [[Xfinity Series]] car was painted purple and gold in honor of Robbins. For the 2021 running, [[Tyler Reddick]]'s RCR #8 [[Nascar]] Cup car carries Robbins' signature magenta and chartreuse livery.

==Discography==
{{main|Marty Robbins discography}}
Robbins' discography consists of 52 studio albums, 13 [[compilation album]]s, and 100 singles. In his career, Robbins charted 17 Number One singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs]] charts, as well as 82 Top 40 singles.

Robbins' highest charting album is 1959's ''[[Gunfighter Ballads and Trail Songs]]''. It charted to #6 on the all-genre [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was also certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The album's first single, "[[El Paso (song)|El Paso]]", became a hit on both the country and pop charts, charting to Number One on the Hot Country Songs as well as the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. While that would be his only pop Number One, in 1957, "[[A White Sport Coat]]" charted to #2, and in 1961, "[[Don't Worry (Marty Robbins song)|Don't Worry]]" charted to #3.

His final Top 10 single was "Honkytonk Man" from the 1982 [[Honkytonk Man|eponymous film]] in which Robbins had a role.  He died shortly before its release.  Since his death, four [[Posthumous publication|posthumous]] studio albums have been released, but they made no impact on the charts.
