'''Enterprise Earth''' is an American [[deathcore]] band from Spokane, Washington.<ref name=aa>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/enterprise-earth-mn0003442439/biography|title=Enterprise Earth - Biography & History |publisher=AllMusic|access-date=January 3, 2018}}</ref> Frontman Dan Watson (former [[Infant Annihilator]] vocalist) and former guitarist BJ Sampson (formerly of Takeover), formed the band in mid-2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.enterpriseearthband.com/about |title=Enterprise Earth About Page |work=Enterprise Earth |access-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307142756/http://www.enterpriseearthband.com/about |archive-date=March 7, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Quickly after their inception, the band began picking up a large internet following. At the beginning of the spring, the band finalised their deal with [[Attila (metalcore band)|Attila]] frontman, Chris Fronzak, and moved to his record label [[Artery Recordings|Stay Sick Recordings]], leaving former label We Are Triumphant.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/attilas_fronz_brings_deathcore_to_his_label_by_signing_enterprise_earth |title=Attila's Fronz Brings Deathcore to His Label by Signing Enterprise Earth |work=Alternative Press |date=June 10, 2015 |access-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304212642/http://www.altpress.com/news/entry/attilas_fronz_brings_deathcore_to_his_label_by_signing_enterprise_earth |archive-date=March 4, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

The band name was Watson's idea, which was inspired by his research into [[Illuminati]] and [[conspiracy theories]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reddit.com/r/Deathcore/comments/3w9zhy/we_are_enterprise_earth_ask_us_anything/|title=We are ENTERPRISE EARTH!
