'''''Irama''''' is the term used for [[tempo]] in [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[gamelan]] in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. It can be used with elaborating instruments. It is a concept used in [[Java]]nese gamelan music,<ref name=Peeters>{{cite web | url=http://recherche.ircam.fr/anasyn/peeters/GAMELAN/index.html | title=The Javanese Gamelan | work=The Javanese Gamelan | access-date=December 5, 2011 | author=Peeters, Geoffroy}}</ref> describing [[melody|melodic]] tempo and relationships in density between the [[balungan]], [[elaborating instrument]]s, and [[colotomy|gong structure]].<ref>Spiller, 2004.</ref> It is distinct from tempo ([[Javanese language|Javanese:]] ''Laya''), as each ''Irama'' can be played in different tempi.<ref name="Sumarsam">{{cite web | url=http://www.gamelan.to/pangkur_one/pangkur_oneBOOKLET.html | title=Gamelan of Central Java | publisher=Yantra Productions (gamelan.to) | work=Gamelan of Central Java â€“ XII.

One way to think of ''Irama'' is to use the most consistently struck instrument in the gamelan, the ''[[saron panerus]]'' (or ''peking''). In some pieces, it plays once per note in the ''balungan'' (such as played by the ''[[saron barung]]''). In others, it may play twice as often, or four times, as the notes of the ''balungan'' are more spread out. This corresponds to a slower ''Irama''. In most cases, the more spread out the ''balungan'' is, the longer it takes to reach a ''[[gong ageng]]''.<ref name="Nyai Saraswati">{{cite web | url=http://www.ibiblio.org/gamelan/education/index.php?topic=peking&view=education | title=Gamelan Nyai Saraswati | publisher=University of North Carolina | work=Introduction to the Peking | access-date=December 5, 2011 | author=Guberman, Daniel}}</ref>

There are five ''Irama'':<ref name=Peeters />

In slower ''Irama'', there is more space to be filled, and typically elaborating instruments become more important.

Each ''Irama'' can be played in three ''Laya'' ("tempi"): 
* ''Seseg'' ("fast"), 
* ''Sedeng'' ("medium") 
* ''Tamban'' ("slow"). 
Frequently, a change of ''Laya'' signals a new section.
