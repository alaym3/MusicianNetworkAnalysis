'''Ghost Bath''' is an American band from [[Minot, North Dakota]], formed in 2012 and fronted by Dennis Mikula. They have released three studio albums and one EP to date, melding [[black metal]] and [[post-rock]] music. They initially gained notoriety for marketing themselves as being from China.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Kim|title=Is Ghost Bath Really China's Answer to Deafheaven|url=http://noisey.vice.com/en_uk/blog/ghost-bath-interview-stream|website=noisey.com|publisher=Vice|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref><ref name="stereogum">{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Michael|title=Ghost Bath-"Golden Number"|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1728045/ghost-bath-golden-number/mp3s/|website=Stereogum|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref>

==History==
Originally the band claimed to have been from [[Chongqing, China]].<ref name="kelly">{{cite web|last1=Kelly|first1=Kim|title=From Velvet Cacoon to Ghost Bath: The Curious Anatomy of a Black Metal Hoax|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/black-metal-hoaxes|website=noisey.com|publisher=Vice|accessdate=18 March 2015}}</ref> Their 2014 debut studio album ''Funeral'' was released on Chinese record label [[Pest Productions]]. They then signed to German label Northern Silence Productions for the release of their second album ''[[Moonlover]]'' in 2015.<ref name="kelly"/> Upon gaining increased media attention, including critical acclaim from [[Pitchfork Media|Pitchfork]] and [[Stereogum]], the band was revealed to be from [[Minot, North Dakota]] and fronted by Dennis Mikula.<ref name="kelly"/> When asked why the band did not correct the false reports on their origin, Mikula stated: "We refused to correct people because we do not wish to put actual faces onto our music. It is our wish as a band to connect to all human beings."<ref name="kelly"/> In 2017, the band followed up ''Moonlover'' with ''Starmourner''. In 2021, they announced ''Self Loather'', the last album in the trilogy that began with ''Moonlover.''

==Musical style==
Ghost Bath combine elements of [[black metal]], including [[tremolo picking]] guitar play and [[shrieked vocals]], with uplifting melodies and atmospheric qualities inspired by [[post-rock]].<ref name="stereogum"/> Their style has thus been associated with [[blackgaze]] and [[post-metal]] and frequently compared to that of fellow American band [[Deafheaven]], particularly on their breakthrough 2013 album ''[[Sunbather (album)|Sunbather]]''.<ref name="stereogum"/><ref name="kelly"/>
