== Musical style ==
The guitarist, Nick Hipa, said of  the direction of the album, "Collectively we've all pushed ourselves, and we're all doing things that we weren't even capable of doing on the last record. And on top of just experimenting and trying different things, I think we just wrote some pretty sick jams, so I'm happy with it. That's all I can say. For kids who like our band and think they know what to expect from us, it might throw them off a little bit . . . I encourage anybody who likes our band to approach this album with an open mind."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=71932|title=AS I LAY DYING Guitarist Discusses Bassist's Departure|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070508081318/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=71932|website=Blabbermuth|author=Nick Hipa |archivedate=May 8, 2007|date=May 5, 2007}}</ref>

The vocalist, [[Tim Lambesis]], also said, "(We) spent some time listening to our last album [2005's ''Shadows Are Security''] and, just from being on tour, we became a little bit jaded by how the genre — as a whole — has sort of copied itself over and over again. We decided we wanted to be more diverse, even down to the point where we sort of felt like we should really focus on writing songs in different categories, and then pick the best songs from those categories and use them for the record."<ref>[http://www.sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=3480 "As I Lay Dying interview"], ''Sputnikmusic''.
