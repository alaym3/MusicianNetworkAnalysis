The '''ANTH domain''' is a membrane binding domain that shows weak specificity for [[PtdIns(4,5)P2]]. It was found in [[AP180]] (homologous to CALM<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endocytosis.org/AP180/Clathrin.html|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070311024540/http://www.endocytosis.org/AP180/Clathrin.html|archive-date = 2007-03-11|title = Clathrin and its interactions with AP180}}</ref>) endocytotic accessory protein that has been implicated in the formation of clathrin-coated pits. The domain is involved in phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate binding and is a universal adaptor for nucleation of clathrin coats.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=de Camilli P, McMahon HT, Peter BJ, Stahelin RV, Cho W, Long F, Murray D |title=Contrasting membrane interaction mechanisms of AP180 N-terminal homology (ANTH) and epsin N-terminal homology (ENTH) domains |journal=J.

Its structure is a solenoid of 9 helices. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding residues are spread over several helices at the tip of the structure. The PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding sequence is Kx9Kx(K/R)(H/Y).

An ANTH domain is also found in [[HIP1]] and [[HIP1R]], and the PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding sequence is conserved. More information is found on [https://web.archive.org/web/20070313235047/http://www.endocytosis.org/AP180/AP180.html endocytosis.org].
