'''Winds of Plague''' is an American [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band from [[Upland, California]]. Formed in 2002, the band is known for being one of the few [[deathcore]] bands to incorporate [[Symphonic metal|symphonic]] elements into their music.

The band's name is derived from a section of lyrics in the [[Unearth]] song "[[Endless (EP)|Endless]]": "Growing wings of sorrow/have brought you to the winds of plague."

== History ==
=== Formation, name change, and debut release (non-studio album) (2002–2005) ===
Winds of Plague was founded in 2002 in [[Upland, California]]. During the time of the band's inception, its name was originally '''Bleak December'''. However, they changed their name in April 2005, to '''Winds of Plague''', being named after a lyric from the [[Unearth]] song, "Endless".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/us/single_artist.php?ID=82|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220093744/http://www.centurymedia.com/us/single_artist.php?ID=82|url-status=dead|title=Century Media official Winds of Plague Biography|archive-date=December 20, 2008|access-date=October 10, 2020}}</ref>
They released their demo ''A Cold Day in Hell'' in late 2005 independently. Several of the songs would subsequently be re-recorded for the following album.

=== ''Decimate the Weak'' (2006–2009) ===
''[[Decimate the Weak]]'', the band's first album for [[Century Media Records]], was released in 2008. The album included several re-recorded tracks  from ''A Cold Day In Hell''.

=== ''The Great Stone War'' and line-up changes (2009–2011) ===
''[[The Great Stone War]]'' was released on August 11, 2009. The album features two singles, "Approach the Podium" and "Chest and Horns", though no music videos were ever shot for any songs on the album.
On October 14, 2009, keyboardist Kristen Randall stated that she would be leaving the band and did so days afterward.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=49195 | title=Winds of Plague Keyboardist Kristen Randall Parts with the Band | access-date=December 31, 2010 | date=October 14, 2009}}</ref> The band approached musician [[Lisa Marx]] to fill in on keyboard for their Australian/New Zealand tour. Afterwards the band found Alana Potocnik who has since been inducted as Winds of Plague's keyboardist.

=== ''Against the World'' (2011–2013) ===
''[[Against the World]]'' was released in 2011 to widespread critical acclaim. "Refined in the Fire" and "California" have been released as singles, and music videos for "Drop the Match", "California" and "Refined in the Fire" have also been released. The band also appeared on the soundtrack for the game ''[[Homefront (video game)|Homefront]]'' performing a cover of the [[Buffalo Springfield]] song "[[For What It's Worth (Buffalo Springfield song)|For What It's Worth]]". A cover of "[[Zombie (The Cranberries song)|Zombie]]" by [[The Cranberries]] was included in an [[iTunes]] extended play for "California", but the EP was later removed from the iTunes store for unknown reasons.

=== ''Resistance'' (2013–2016) ===
Winds of Plague's fourth studio album, ''[[Resistance (Winds of Plague album)|Resistance]]'', was recorded in early to mid-2013 and was released on October 29, 2013.

In December 2015, while playing the Affliction Metal Show at The Observatory in Santa Ana with [[Suicide Silence]], vocalist Johnny Plague announced that after going through a brief hiatus, Winds of Plague would resume touring and working on a new album in 2016.

=== ''Blood of My Enemy'' (2017–present) ===
