== Life and career ==
Brian Fennell was born on January 16, 1983 in Issaquah, Washington. After living in several places in and around Seattle, he's since returned to his hometown and lives there currently where he writes and produces out of a home studio.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://www.onestowatch.com/blog/simplicity-sad-songs-how-shazam-inadvertently|title=Simplicity, Sad Songs, & How Shazam Inadvertently Launched His Solo Career: A Q&A With SYML|work=[[Ones to Watch]]|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>

Fennell started playing piano at a young age, and wrote his first song when he was 18 years old as a coping mechanism after the death of a schoolmate.<ref name=":2" /> After high school, he attended [[Seattle Pacific University]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.mi-reporter.com/life/barcelona-band-has-mi-roots/|title=Barcelona band has MI roots {{!}} Mercer Island Reporter|date=2008-11-24|work=Mercer Island Reporter|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-US}}</ref> where he got a degree in Music Education with an emphasis in percussion.<ref name=":2">{{Citation|last=FaceCulture|title=SYML interview (part 1)|date=2017-12-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydD1X7QLB3k|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref>

Fennell currently performs under the solo project SYML. It means “simple” in Welsh, and is pulled from his own personal heritage. He was adopted as a child, and later in life found out that his biological parents are Welsh. His experience grappling with both his adoption and heritage are influences in his songwriting.<ref name=":1" />

After his song "Where's My Love" was used on the popular drama TV show ''[[Teen Wolf (2011 TV series)|Teen Wolf]]'', the song charted for 20 weeks on the Billboard Hot Rock Songs chart.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/syml/chart-history/rock-songs/song/1015973|title=Syml Where's My Love Chart History|work=Billboard|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> In 2018, the song received Gold certification in Canada and Belgium,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nettwerk.com/news/2018/syml-and-sam-feldt-collaborate-where%E2%80%99s-my-love|title=SYML and SAM FELDT Collaborate on "Where's My Love" {{!}} Nettwerk|website=www.nettwerk.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> and held the #1 spot on Canada's CBC Top 20 charts twice.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/19752/cbc-music-top-20-march-15-janelle-monae-syml|title=CBC Music Top 20, March 15: Janelle Monae, Big Little Lions debut and SYML is new at No. 1|work=CBC Music|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbcmusic.ca/posts/19796/cbc-music-top-20-march-29|title=CBC Music Top 20, March 29: Natalie Prass and Megan Bonnell debut but James Bay has the highest new entry|work=CBC Music|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> SYML's "Wildfire" also appeared in a Belgian teen drama web series wtFOCK<ref>https://www.wtfock.be/ {{Bare URL inline|date=September 2021}}</ref> (broadcast by VIER and VIJF 2018 - so far) - an adaption of the popular Norwegian series SKAM.<ref>[https://tv.nrk.no/serie/skam Skam – Nrk Tv<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> "Where's My Love" was also featured prominently in the official trailer for the 2018 motion picture ''[[Adrift (2018 film)|Adrift]].''<ref>{{Citation|last=STX Entertainment|title=Adrift {{!}} Official Trailer {{!}} Now In Theaters|date=2018-03-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9ukI7khQpE&lc=UgxiLpDvR7Oxi13j3qV4AaABAg|access-date=2018-07-12}}</ref> SYML's three singles "Where's My Love", "Fear of Water" and "Body" were featured in an American Supernatural Drama Television series, Shadowhunters.
