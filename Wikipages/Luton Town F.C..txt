'''Luton Town Football Club''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|uː|t|ən}})<!-- NOTE! Per [[WP:ENGVAR]] and agreement at [[WP:FAC]], this article will refer to the club in the singular and the team in plural--> is a professional [[association football]] club based in the town of [[Luton]], Bedfordshire, England, that competes in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], the second tier of the [[English football league system]]. Founded in 1885, it is nicknamed 'the Hatters' and affiliated to the [[Bedfordshire County Football Association]]. The team plays its home matches at [[Kenilworth Road]], where it has been based since 1905. The club's history includes major trophy wins, several financial crises, numerous [[Promotion and relegation|promotions and relegations]], and some spells of sustained success. It was perhaps most prominent between 1982 and 1992, when it was a member of English football's top division, at that time the [[Football League First Division|First Division]]; the team won its first major honour, the [[Football League Cup]], in 1988. Luton Town have a [[Luton Town F.C.–Watford F.C. rivalry|long-standing rivalry]] with nearby club [[Watford F.C.|Watford]].

The club was the first in southern England to turn professional, making payments to players as early as 1890 and turning fully professional a year later. It joined [[English Football League|the Football League]] before the [[1897–98 Football League|1897–98 season]], left in 1900 because of financial problems, and rejoined in 1920. Luton reached the First Division in [[1955–56 in English football|1955–56]] and contested a major final for the first time when playing [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in the [[1959 FA Cup Final]]. The team was then relegated from the top division in [[1959–60 in English football|1959–60]], and demoted twice more in the following five years, playing in the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] from the [[1965–66 in English football|1965–66 season]]. However, it was promoted back to the top level by [[1974–75 Luton Town F.C. season|1974–75]].

Luton Town's most recent successful period began in [[1981–82 Football League|1981–82]], when the club won the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]], and thereby gained promotion to the First. Luton defeated [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] 3–2 in the [[1988 Football League Cup Final]] and remained in the First Division until relegation at the end of the [[1991–92 Luton Town F.C. season|1991–92 season]]. Between 2007 and 2009, financial difficulties caused the club to fall from the second tier of English football to the fifth in successive seasons. The last of these relegations came during the [[2008–09 Luton Town F.C. season|2008–09 season]], when 30 points were docked from Luton's record for various financial irregularities. Luton thereafter spent five seasons in [[non-League football]] before winning the [[Conference Premier]] in [[2013–14 Luton Town F.C. season|2013–14]], securing promotion back into the Football League. More success soon followed, with Luton being promoted from League Two and One in successive seasons in 2017–18 and 2018–19, meaning Luton now play in the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], for the first time since [[2006–07 Luton Town F.C. season|2006–07]].

===Formation and election to the Southern League (1885–1890)===
Luton Town Football Club was formed on 11 April 1885.<ref>{{cite book |first=Timothy |last=Collings |title=The Luton Town Story 1885–1985 |year=1985 |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |location=Luton |isbn=978-0-9510679-0-1 |pages=1–2}}</ref><ref name=Hayes55>{{cite book |first=Dean P. |last=Hayes |title=Completely Top Hatters! |year=2002 |publisher=Book Castle Publishing |location=Dunstable |isbn=978-1-903747-27-8 |page=55}}</ref> Before this there were many clubs in the town, the most prominent of which were Luton Wanderers and Luton Excelsior. A Wanderers player, George Deacon, came up with the idea of a 'Town' club which would include all the best players in Luton. Wanderers secretary Herbert Spratley seized upon Deacon's idea and arranged a secret meeting on 13 January 1885 at the St Matthews school rooms in [[High Town, Luton|High Town]]. The Wanderers committee resolved to rename the club Luton Town—which was not well received by the wider community. The local newspapers referred to the club as 'Luton Town (late Wanderers)'. When George Deacon and John Charles Lomax then arranged a public meeting with the purpose of forming a 'Luton Town Football Club', Spratley protested, saying there was already a Luton Town club; and the atmosphere was tense when the meeting convened in the town hall on 11 April 1885. The meeting, attended by most football lovers in the town, heard about Spratley's secret January meeting and voted down his objections. The motion to form a 'Luton Town Football Club', put forward by G&nbsp;H Small and seconded by E&nbsp;H Lomax, was carried. A club committee was elected by ballot and the team colours were agreed to be pink and dark blue shirts and caps.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chapter Six – 11th April 1885 |url=http://thestrawplaiters.com/chapter-6-11th-april-1885/ |work=Straw Plaiters: Luton Town Football Club in the Victorian era |publisher=Brian Webb |access-date=24 November 2018}}</ref>

Initially based at Excelsior's [[Dallow Lane]] ground,<ref name=Hayes55/> Luton Town began making payments to certain individual players in 1890.

===Non-League and subsequent promotions (2009–present)===
Relegation meant that [[2009–10 Luton Town F.C. season|2009–10]] saw Luton playing in the [[Conference Premier]], a competition in which the club had never before participated. The club unsuccessfully contested the promotion play-offs three times in four seasons during their time as a non-League club, employing five different managers. In the [[2012–13 FA Cup]] fourth round, Luton won their [[Norwich City 0–1 Luton Town (2013)|away tie]] against [[Premier League]] club [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] 1–0 and, in doing so, became the first non-League team to beat a side from England's top division since 1989.<ref>{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Osborne |title=Norwich 0–1 Luton |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/21095990 |work=BBC Sport |date=26 January 2013 |access-date=15 December 2016}}</ref> In the [[2013–14 Luton Town F.C. season|2013–14 season]], under the management of [[John Still (footballer)|John Still]], Luton won the Conference Premier title with three games to spare, and thereby secured a return to the Football League from [[2014–15 Luton Town F.C. season|2014–15]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Luton Town win Conference Premier and Football League spot |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/26978690 |work=BBC Sport |date=15 April 2014 |access-date=15 December 2016}}</ref> After reaching the [[EFL League Two play-offs|League Two play-offs]] in [[2016–17 Luton Town F.C. season|2016–17]],<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Simmonds |title=Hatters hit four as they hammer Accrington |url=https://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town/hatters-hit-four-as-they-hammer-accrington-1-7939723 |newspaper=Luton Today |date=29 April 2017 |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> when they were beaten 6–5 [[Aggregate score|on aggregate]] by [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] in the semi-final,<ref>{{cite news |first=Brendon |last=Mitchell |title=Luton Town 3–3 Blackpool (agg: 5–6) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39879758 |work=BBC Sport |date=18 May 2017 |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> Luton were promoted back to [[EFL League One|League One]] the [[2017–18 Luton Town F.C. season|following season]] as runners-up.<ref>{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Simmonds |title=Luton seal promotion to League One with Carlisle draw |url=https://www.lutontoday.co.uk/sport/football/luton-town/luton-seal-promotion-to-league-one-with-carlisle-draw-1-8470404 |newspaper=Luton Today |date=21 April 2018 |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Luton Town 3–1 Forest Green Rovers |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43846878 |work=BBC Sport |date=28 April 2018 |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref> Luton achieved a second successive promotion in [[2018–19 Luton Town F.C. season|2018–19]], after they won the League One title, marking the club's return to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] after a 12-year absence.<ref>{{cite news |title=League One promotion: Luton Town and Barnsley return to Championship for 2019–20 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/48114557 |work=BBC Sport |date=30 April 2019 |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=League One roundup: Luton seal title as Plymouth go down on goal difference |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/may/04/league-one-roundup-luton-title-plymouth-goal-difference |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=4 May 2019 |access-date=5 May 2019}}</ref>

The club's nickname, "the Hatters", reflects Luton's historical connection with the [[Hatmaking|hat making]] trade, which has been prominent there since the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=A history hat making in Luton |url=http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/luton/0.local/hat_plaiting.htm |work=Plaiting and Straw Hat Making |publisher=Luton Libraries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527182358/http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/luton/0.local/hat_plaiting.htm |archive-date=27 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Origins of Luton's Hat Industry |url=http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/luton/0.local/hat_origins_industry.htm |work=Plaiting and Straw Hat Making |publisher=Luton Libraries |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222030446/http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/luton/0.local/hat_origins_industry.htm |archive-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> The nickname was originally a variant on the now rarely seen straw-plaiters.

The club is associated with two very different colour schemes—white and black (first permanently adopted in 1920), and orange, navy and white (first used in 1973, and worn by the team as of the [[2015–16 Luton Town F.C. season|2015–16 season]]). Luton mainly wore a combination of light blue and white before 1920, when white shirts and black shorts were first adopted. These colours were retained for over half a century, with the colour of the socks varying between white and black, until Luton changed to orange, navy and white at the start of the [[1973–74 in English football|1973–74 season]]. Luton began playing in white shirts, shorts and socks in 1979, with the orange and navy motif reduced to trim; navy shorts were adopted in 1984. This palette was retained until the [[1999–2000 Luton Town F.C. season|1999–2000 season]], when the team played in orange shirts and blue shorts. From 2000 to 2008, Luton returned to white shirts and black shorts; orange was included as trim until 2007. The white, navy and orange palette favoured in the 1980s was brought back in 2008, following the results of a club poll,<ref>{{cite web |title=One Day to Go!! |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1372290,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=22 August 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319081740/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1372290%2C00.html |archive-date=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> but a year later the colours were changed yet again, this time to a predominantly orange strip with white shorts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Luton Town F.C.

Luton Town have traditionally used the town's crest as its own in a manner similar to many other teams. The club's first badge was a white eight-pointed star, which was emblazoned across the team's shirts (then a deep [[cochineal]] red) in 1892. Four years later a crest comprising the club's initials intertwined was briefly adopted. The shirts were thereafter plain until 1933, when Luton first adopted a badge depicting a straw boater, which appeared on Luton shirts. The letters "LTFC" were added in 1935, and this basic design remained until 1947. The club then played without a badge until 1970, when the club began to wear the town crest regularly, having first done so in the 1959 FA Cup Final.<ref name=papbadge>{{cite book |title=The Hatters: Passion and Pride since 1885 |chapter=The Badge |year=2011 |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |location=Luton |page=112}}</ref>

In 1973, concurrently with the club's switch to the orange kit, a new badge was introduced featuring the new colours. The new emblem depicted a stylised orange football, bearing the letters "Lt", surrounded by the club's name in navy blue text.<ref name=papbadge/> In 1987, the club switched back to a derivative of the town emblem, with the shield portion of the heraldic crest becoming the team's badge; the only similarity with the previous design was the inclusion of the club name around the shield in navy blue. The "rainbow" badge, introduced in 1994, featured the town crest below an orange and blue bow which curved around to meet two footballs, positioned on either side of the shield, with the club name underneath.<ref name=papbadge/> This badge was used until 2005, when a replacement very similar to the 1987 version was adopted, featuring black text rather than blue and a straw boater in place of the outstretched arm depicted in the older design. The club's founding year, 1885, was added in 2008.<ref name=HFK/> The badge was altered once more during the [[2009–10 Luton Town F.C. season|2009–10]] pre-season, with the red of the town crest being replaced with orange to better reflect the club colours.<ref name=kit2011>{{cite web |title=Revealed: The New Crest |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10372~1735608,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=28 July 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301145328/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10372~1735608%2C00.html |archive-date=1 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:LTFCattendancespostwar2017.png|thumb|Luton Town's average home league attendances at Kenilworth Road from [[1946–47 Football League|1946–47]] to [[2016–17 English Football League|2016–17]]. Attendances rose with Luton's promotion in 1955 before plummeting during the early 1960s as the club suffered three relegations. Spectators returned with the promotions of the late 1960s and mid 1970s, before seeing a decline with the introduction of an [[all-seater stadium]] in 1986.|alt=See accompanying text]]

Luton Town's first ground was at [[Dallow Lane]], the former ground of Excelsior.<ref name=Hayes55/> The ground was next to the [[Dunstable Branch Lines|Dunstable to Luton railway line]], and players regularly claimed to have trouble seeing the ball because of smoke from the trains.<ref name=Hayes43/> A damaging financial loss during [[1896–97 in English football|1896–97]] forced Luton to sell the stadium to stay afloat and, as a result, the club moved across the tracks to a stadium between the railway and Dunstable Road.<ref name=Hayes43/> The [[Dunstable Road]] ground was opened by [[Herbrand Russell, 11th Duke of Bedford]], who also donated £50 towards the £800 building costs.<ref name=Hayes43/> When the site was sold for housing in 1905, the club was forced to move again at short notice,<ref name=Hayes43/> to its present [[Kenilworth Road]] site, in time for the start of the [[1905–06 in English football|1905–06 season]].<ref name=TLTS3/><ref name=Hayes43/>

The stadium now has an all-seater capacity of 10,356 and is situated in the [[Bury Park]] area of [[Luton]]. It was named after the road that runs along one end of it, although the official address of the club is 1 Maple Road. Opposite the eponymous Kenilworth Stand is the Oak Road End, which has evolved from a stand first used exclusively by Luton supporters, then later by away supporters, and now used by both except in times of high ticket demand from away clubs. The Main Stand is flanked by the [[David Preece (footballer, born 1963)|David Preece]] Stand, and opposite them stands a row of executive boxes. These boxes replaced the Bobbers Stand in 1986, as the club sought to maximise income.<ref name=KenilworthStadium>{{cite web |title=Kenilworth Stadium |url=http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/KenilworthStadium/0,,10372,00.html |publisher=Luton Town F.C. |date=21 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319064227/http://www.lutontown.co.uk/page/KenilworthStadium/0%2C%2C10372%2C00.html |archive-date=19 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The original Main Stand burnt down in 1921, and was replaced by the current stand before the [[1922–23 in English football|1922–23 season]]. The ground underwent extensive redevelopment during the 1930s, and the capacity by the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]] was 30,000. [[Floodlights (sport)|Floodlights]] were installed before the [[1953–54 in English football|1953–54 season]], but it was 20 years before any further modernisation was carried out. In 1973 the Bobbers Stand became all-seated, and in 1985 the grass pitch was replaced with an [[Artificial turf|artificial playing surface]]; it quickly became unpopular and was derided as "the plastic pitch".<ref name=TLTS27/><ref name=KenilworthStadium/><ref>{{cite news |first=Sean |last=McGuire |title=Unlucky Luton, a reminder of football's forgotten days |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/sport/liverpool-football/2009/04/17/sean-mcguire-unlucky-luton-a-reminder-of-football-s-forgotten-days-92534-23405017/ |newspaper=Liverpool Daily Post |date=17 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325002307/http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/sport/liverpool-football/2009/04/17/sean-mcguire-unlucky-luton-a-reminder-of-football-s-forgotten-days-92534-23405017/ |archive-date=25 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |first=Graham |last=Lawton |title=Pitch battle over artificial grass |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg18625021-300-pitch-battle-over-artificial-grass/ |journal=New Scientist |issue=2502 |page=35 |date=1 June 2005 |access-date=15 December 2016}}</ref>

A [[1985 Kenilworth Road riot|serious incident involving hooliganism]] before, during and after a match against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in 1985 caused the club's then chairman, [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) [[David Evans (British politician)|David Evans]], to introduce a scheme effective from the start of [[1986–87 Luton Town F.C. season|1986–87]] banning all visiting supporters from the ground, and requiring home fans to carry membership cards when attending matches.<ref>{{cite news |first=Christopher |last=Davies |title=Millwall hopes to leave dark history behind in F.A.

===New stadium===
The club first expressed an interest in building a new stadium away from Kenilworth Road in 1955, the year it won promotion to the First Division for the first time. Even then the ground was small compared to those of most First and Second Division clubs, and its location made significant redevelopment difficult. The team has since made several attempts to relocate.<ref name=TLTS70/> Leaving Luton for the nearby new town of [[Milton Keynes]] was unsuccessfully [[Relocation of Wimbledon F.C. to Milton Keynes#Luton Town—"MK Hatters" (1980s)|proposed]] several times, most notably in the 1980s.<ref>{{cite news |first=Neil |last=Rose |title=Luton Town 1 MK Dons 0 |url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1623&Itemid=29 |journal=When Saturday Comes |date=20 June 2005 |access-date=11 April 2009}}</ref> The club sold Kenilworth Road to Luton Council in 1989, and has since leased it.<ref name="Luton Town FC in talks to buy back Kenilworth Road"/> A planning application for a new 20,000-seater indoor stadium, the "Kohlerdome" proposed by chairman [[David Kohler (developer)|David Kohler]] in 1995, was turned down by the [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] in 1998, and Kohler left soon after.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Mihir |last=Bose |title=Luton chairman ready for a stretch inside |journal=The Sunday Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |page=22 |date=23 October 1994}}; {{cite journal |title=Lawrence counts cost of progress |journal=The Sunday Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |page=5 (Sport) |date=29 November 1998}}; {{cite journal |title=Luton's proposed stadium blocked |journal=The Times |publisher=Times Newspapers |page=49 |date=23 February 1999}}</ref>
