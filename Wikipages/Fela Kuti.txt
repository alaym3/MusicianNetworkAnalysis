'''Fela Aníkúlápó Kuti''' (born '''Olufela Olusegun Oludotun Ransome-Kuti'''; 15 October 1938 – 2 August 1997), also known as '''Abami Eda''', was a Nigerian [[multi-instrumentalist]], [[bandleader]], [[composer]], [[Activism|political activist]], and [[Pan-Africanist]]. He is regarded as the pioneer of [[Afrobeat]], an [[African music]] genre that combines [[tradition]]al [[yoruba music|Yoruba]] percussion and vocal styles with American [[funk]] and [[jazz]].<ref name="oesketite"/> At the height of his popularity, he was referred to as one of [[Africa]]'s most "challenging and charismatic music performers".<ref name="rebel">{{cite journal |last=Grass |first=Randall F. |date=1 January 1986 |title=Fela Anikulapo-Kuti: The Art of an Afrobeat Rebel |jstor=1145717 |journal=The Drama Review: TDR |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=131–148 |doi=10.2307/1145717}}</ref> [[AllMusic]] described him as a "musical and sociopolitical voice" of international significance.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{allMusic|class=artist|id=mn0000138833}}</ref>

Kuti was the son of a Nigerian [[women's rights]] activist, [[Funmilayo Ransome-Kuti]]. After early experiences abroad, he and his band Africa&nbsp;70 (featuring drummer [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]]) shot to stardom in [[Nigeria]] during the 1970s, during which he was an outspoken critic and target of [[Nigerian military juntas of 1966–1979 and 1983–1999|Nigeria's military juntas]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In 1970, he founded the [[Kalakuta Republic]] commune, which declared itself independent from military rule.

===1970s===

After Kuti and his band returned to Nigeria, the group was renamed (the) Africa '70 as lyrical themes changed from love to social issues.<ref name="yabis"/> He formed the [[Kalakuta Republic]]&mdash;a [[commune (intentional community)|commune]], recording studio, and home for many people connected to the band&mdash;which he later declared independent from the Nigerian state.

{{anchor|Club}}Kuti set up a nightclub in the Empire Hotel, first named the Afro-Spot and later the Afrika Shrine, where he both performed regularly and officiated at personalised [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traditional ceremonies in honor of his nation's ancestral faith. He also changed his name to Anikulapo (meaning "He who carries death in his pouch", with the interpretation: "I will be the master of my own destiny and will decide when it is time for death to take me").<ref name="Barrett_1998"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nigerian.name/w/index.php?title=Anikulapo |title=Meaning of Anikulapo in |publisher=Nigerian.name |date=11 January 2008 |access-date=1 October 2011}}</ref> He stopped using the hyphenated surname "Ransome" because he considered it a [[slave name]].

Kuti's music was popular among the Nigerian public and Africans in general.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://emn-news.com/fela-anikulapo-kuti-the-ghost-resurrects-and-the-beat-goes-on-a-review-by-the-independence/ |title=Fela Anikulapo Kuti: The 'ghost' resurrects and the beat goes on, a preview by The Independence |publisher=Emnnews.com |access-date=1 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117023623/http://emn-news.com/fela-anikulapo-kuti-the-ghost-resurrects-and-the-beat-goes-on-a-review-by-the-independence/ |archive-date=17 January 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}{{updated|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> He decided to sing in [[Nigerian Pidgin|Pidgin English]] so that individuals all over Africa could enjoy his music, where the local languages they speak are [[African languages|diverse and numerous]]. As popular as Kuti's music had become in Nigeria and elsewhere, it was unpopular with the ruling government, and raids on the Kalakuta Republic were frequent. During 1972, [[Ginger Baker]] recorded ''[[Stratavarious]],'' with Kuti appearing alongside vocalist and guitarist [[Bobby Tench]].<ref>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p130948/credits|pure_url=yes}} Bobby Gass credits], [[AllMusic]]</ref> Around this time, Kuti became even more involved with the [[Yoruba religion]].<ref name="rebel"/>

In 1977, Kuti and Africa 70 released the album [[Zombie (album)|''Zombie'']], which heavily criticized Nigerian soldiers, and used the zombie metaphor to describe the [[Military of Nigeria|Nigerian military's]] methods. The album was a massive success and infuriated the government, who raided the Kalakuta Republic with 1,000 soldiers. During the raid, Kuti was severely beaten, and his elderly mother was fatally injured after being thrown from a window.<ref name="Barrett_1998"/> The commune was burnt down, and Kuti's studio, instruments, and [[master tapes]] were destroyed. Kuti claimed that he would have been killed had it not been for a commanding officer's intervention as he was being beaten. Kuti's response to the attack was to deliver his mother's coffin to the [[Dodan Barracks]] in [[Lagos]], General [[Olusegun Obasanjo]]'s residence, and to write two songs, "Coffin for Head of State" and "Unknown Soldier," referencing the official inquiry that claimed an unknown soldier had destroyed the commune.<ref>{{cite news|author=Matthew McKinnon|date=12 August 2005|title=Rebel Yells: A protest music mixtape|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/arts/photoessay/protest/index14.html|access-date=22 November 2009}} {{dead link|date=February 2021}}</ref>

Kuti and his band took up residence in Crossroads Hotel after the Shrine had been destroyed along with the commune. In 1978, he married 27 women: Kikelomo Oseyni, Folake Oladejo, Tejumade Adebiyi, Naa Lamiley, Sewaa Kuti, Omotola Osaeti, Omowunmi Oyedele, Alake Anikulapo Kuti, Shade Shodeinde, Adeola Williams, Najite Kuti, Emaruagheru Osawe, Kevwe Oghomienor, Ihase Anikulapo, Adejonwo Iyabode Ogunitro, Bose Anikulapo Kuti, Lara Anikulapo Kuti, Suru Eriomola, Tokunbo Akran, Funmi Kuti, Omowunmi Afesumo, Laide Anikulapo Kuti, Ronke Edason, Damiregba Anikulapo Kuti, Aduni Idowu, and Omolara Shosanya Remilekun Taylor. Many of them were dancers, composers, and singers with whom he worked. The marriage served not only to mark the anniversary of the attack on the Kalakuta Republic but also to protect Kuti and his wives from authorities' false claims that Kuti was kidnapping women.<ref>{{cite book |last=See: Washington |first=Teresa N. |title=The Architects of Existence: Aje in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature |publisher=Oya's Tornado |year=2014 |pages=218–219 |isbn=978-0991073016}}</ref> Later, he adopted a rotation system of maintaining 12 simultaneous wives.<ref name="music.guardian.co.uk">{{cite news |last=Culshaw |first=Peter |title=The big Fela |url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1927705,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=15 August 2004 |access-date=2 May 2010}}</ref> There were also two concerts in the year: the first was in [[Accra]], in which rioting broke out during the song "Zombie", which caused Kuti to be banned from entering [[Ghana]]; the second was after the [[Berlin Jazz Festival]] when most of Kuti's musicians deserted him due to rumours that he planned to use all of the proceeds to fund his presidential campaign.

In 1979, Kuti formed his political party, which he called [[Movement of the People|Movement of the People (MOP)]], to "clean up society like a mop",<ref name="Barrett_1998"/> but it quickly became inactive due to his confrontations with the government of the day.

===1980s and beyond===
In 1983, Kuti nominated himself for president<ref name="Barrett_1998" /> in Nigeria's first elections in decades, but his candidature was refused. At this time, Kuti created a new band, Egypt 80, which reflected the view that [[Egyptian Civilization|Egyptian civilization]], knowledge, philosophy, mathematics, and religious systems are African and must be claimed as such. Kuti stated in an interview: "Stressing the point that I have to make Africans aware of the fact that Egyptian civilization belongs to the African. So that was the reason why I changed the name of my band to Egypt 80."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFY-6x1qTzU |title=Fela Kuti & Egypt 80 Arsenal TV3 Catalonian TV 1987-08-04 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |access-date=2020-05-01}}</ref> Kuti continued to record albums and tour the country. He further infuriated the political establishment by implicating [[ITT Corporation]]'s vice-president, [[Moshood Abiola]], and Obasanjo in the popular 25-minute political screed entitled "I.T.T. (International Thief-Thief)".<ref name="Barrett_1998"/>

In 1984, [[Muhammadu Buhari]]'s government, of which Kuti was a vocal opponent, jailed him on a charge of currency [[smuggling]]. [[Amnesty International]] and others denounced the charges as politically motivated.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2006/feb/15/guardianobituaries.mainsection |location=London |work=The Guardian |first=Shola |last=Adenekan |title=Obituary: Dr Beko Ransome-Kuti |date=15 February 2006}}</ref> Amnesty designated him a [[prisoner of conscience]],<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=10097 |title=Success stories |publisher=Amnesty International |access-date=9 June 2012}}</ref> and other human rights groups also took up his case. After 20 months, General [[Ibrahim Babangida]] released him from prison. On his release, Kuti divorced his 12 remaining wives, citing "marriage brings jealousy and selfishness".<ref name="music.guardian.co.uk"/>

Kuti continued to release albums with Egypt 80 and toured in the United States and Europe while continuing to be politically active. In 1986 he performed in [[Giants Stadium]] in [[New Jersey]] as part of [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] concert along with [[Bono]], [[Carlos Santana]], and [[the Neville Brothers]]. In 1989, Kuti and Egypt 80 released the anti-[[apartheid]] album ''Beasts of No Nation'' that depicted U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], UK Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], and South African State President [[Pieter Willem Botha]] on its cover. The title of the composition evolved out of a statement by Botha: "This uprising [against the apartheid system] will bring out the beast in us."<ref name="Barrett_1998"/>

Kuti's album output slowed in the 1990s, and eventually, he ceased releasing albums altogether. On 21 January 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|last=Akinyemi|first=Oluwamayowa|title=NOSTALGIA: 28 Years Ago Today, Fela Kuti Was Arrested On Suspicion Of Murder - A New Touch of Africa|url=https://anewtouchofafrica.com/nostalgia-28-years-ago-today-fela-kuti-was-arrested-on-suspicion-of-murder/|access-date=2021-01-24|language=en-US}}</ref> he and four members of Africa 70 were arrested and were later charged on 25 January for the murder of an electrician.<ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|date=1993-01-25|title=NIGERIAN MUSICIAN FELA CHARGED WITH MURDER|language=en-US|work=[[The Washington Post]]|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1993/01/26/nigerian-musician-fela-charged-with-murder/53f09d58-3ad4-47c3-b6e6-8b2fd2b21643/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-01-24|issn=0190-8286}}</ref> Rumours also speculated that he was suffering from an illness for which he was refusing treatment.

==Death==
On 3 August 1997, Kuti's brother Olikoye Ransome-Kuti, already a prominent [[AIDS]] activist and former [[Federal Ministry of Health (Nigeria)|Minister of Health]], announced that Kuti had died on the previous day from complications related to AIDS.

==Music==
{{main|Afrobeat}}
Kuti's musical style is called Afrobeat. It is a style he largely created, and is a complex fusion of [[jazz]], [[funk]], [[highlife]], and traditional Nigerian, African chants and rhythms. It contains elements of psychedelic soul and has similarities to James Brown's style of composition. Afrobeat also borrows heavily from the native "tinker pan".<ref>As Iwedi Ojinmah points out in his article "Baba is Dead – Long Live Baba,"</ref> [[Tony Allen (musician)|Tony Allen]] (Kuti's drummer of twenty years) was instrumental in the creation of Afrobeat. Kuti once stated that "there would be no Afrobeat without Tony Allen".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Giants of Afrobeat: an interview with Tony Allen and Orlando Julius|url=https://www.songlines.co.uk/explore/features/giants-of-afrobeat-an-interview-with-tony-allen-and-orlando-julius|access-date=2021-01-15|first=Nigel|last= Williamson|website=Songlines|language=en|date=1 May 2020}}</ref>

Kuti's band was notable for featuring two [[baritone saxophone]]s when most groups only used one. This is a common technique in African and African-influenced musical styles and can be seen in [[funk]] and [[hip hop]]. His bands sometimes performed with two bassists at the same time both playing interlocking melodies and rhythms. There were always two or more guitarists. The electric West African style guitar in Afrobeat bands is paramount but is used to give basic structure, playing a repeating chordal/melodic statement, riff, or groove.

Some elements often present in Kuti's music are the call-and-response within the chorus and figurative but simple lyrics. His songs were also very long, at least 10–15 minutes in length, and many reached 20 or 30 minutes, while some unreleased tracks would last up to 45 minutes when performed live. Their length was one of many reasons that his music never reached a substantial degree of popularity outside Africa. His LP records frequently had one 30-minute track per side. Typically there is an "Instrumental Introduction" jam part of the song roughly 10–15 minutes long before Kuti starts singing the "main" part of the song, featuring his lyrics and singing, for another 10–15 minutes. On some recordings, his songs are divided into two parts: Part 1 being the instrumental, and Part 2 adding in vocals.

Kuti's songs are mostly sung in [[Nigerian]] pidgin English, although he also performed a few songs in the [[Yoruba language]]. His main instruments were the saxophone and the [[electric piano|keyboards]], but he also played the trumpet, electric guitar, and the occasional drum solo. Kuti refused to perform songs again after he had already recorded them, which hindered his popularity outside Africa.

Kuti was known for his showmanship, and his concerts were often outlandish and wild. He referred to his stage act as the "Underground Spiritual Game". Many expected him to perform shows like those in the Western world, but during the 1980s, he was not interested in putting on a "show". His European performance was a representation of what was relevant at the time and his other inspirations.<ref name="rebel"/> He attempted to make a movie but lost all the materials to the fire that was set to his house by the military government in power.<ref name=":2">{{Cite news|last=Darnton|first=John|date=1977-07-24|title=NIGERIA'S DISSIDENT SUPERSTAR|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/24/archives/nigerias-dissident-superstar-fela.html|access-date=2021-04-29|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> He thought that art, and thus his own music, should have political meaning.<ref name="rebel"/>

Kuti was part of an Afro-Centric consciousness movement that was founded on and delivered through his music. In an interview included in Hank Bordowitz's ''Noise of the World'', Kuti stated:<blockquote>Music is supposed to have an effect. If you're playing music and people don't feel something, you're not doing shit. That's what African music is about. When you hear something, you must move. I want to move people to dance, but also to think. Music wants to dictate a better life, against a bad life. When you're listening to something that depicts having a better life, and you're not having a better life, it must have an effect on you.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bordowitz |first1=Hank |title=Noise of the World: Non-Western Musicians In Their Own Words |date=2004 |publisher=Soft Skull Press |location=Canada |page=170}}</ref></blockquote>

Kuti's music and activism were inspired by his surroundings. In interview footage found in ''Faces of Africa'' on CGTN Africa, he spoke of comparison between English love songs and his own music: <blockquote>Yes, if you are in England, the music can be an instrument of enjoyment. You can sing about love, you can sing about whom you are going to bed next. But in my own environment, my society is underdeveloped because of an alien system on our people. So there is no music enjoyment. There is nothing like love. There is something like the struggle for people's existence.<ref>{{cite AV media |people =CGTN Africa |date=November 20, 2016 |title=Faces of Africa - Fela Kuti: The Father of Afrobeat, Part 1 |medium=documentary series |publisher=CGTN Africa}}</ref></blockquote>

==Political views and activism==

=== Activism ===
Kuti was highly engaged in political activism in Africa from the 1970s until his death. He criticized the [[Corruption in Nigeria|corruption of Nigerian government]] officials and the mistreatment of Nigerian citizens. He spoke of colonialism as the root of the socio-economic and political problems that plagued the African people. Corruption was one of the worst political problems facing Africa in the 1970s and Nigeria was among the most corrupt countries. Its government [[Electoral fraud|rigged elections]] and performed [[Military coups in Nigeria|coups]] that ultimately worsened poverty, economic inequality, unemployment, and political instability, further promoting corruption and crime. Kuti's protest songs covered themes inspired by the realities of corruption and [[Economic inequality|socio-economic inequality]] in Africa. Kuti's political statements could be heard throughout Africa.<ref name=":2"/>

Kuti's open vocalization of the violent and oppressive regime controlling Nigeria did not come without consequence. He was arrested on over 200 different occasions and spent time in jail, including his longest stint of 20 months after his arrest in 1984. On top of jail time, the corrupt government sent soldiers to beat Kuti, his family and friends, and destroy wherever he lived and whatever instruments or recordings he had.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Editor|date=2017-08-03|title=20 years after Fela's death, his music, lifestyle and influence lives on » YNaija|url=https://naija.yafri.ca/20-years-after-felas-death-his-music-lifestyle-and-influence-lives-on/|access-date=2021-01-20|website=YNaija|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Darnton|first=John|date=1977-07-24|title=NIGERIA'S DISSIDENT SUPERSTAR (Published 1977)|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/07/24/archives/nigerias-dissident-superstar-fela.html|access-date=2021-01-20|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

In the 1970s, Kuti began to run outspoken political columns in the advertising space of daily and weekly newspapers such as ''The Daily Times'' and ''[[The Punch]]'', bypassing editorial censorship in Nigeria's predominantly state-controlled media.<ref>This section includes material copied verbatim from [http://www.chimurengalibrary.co.za/periodicals.php?id=17 "Chief Priest Say"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804141056/http://www.chimurengalibrary.co.za/periodicals.php?id=17 |date=4 August 2008}}, at chimurenga library.co.za, released under [[GFDL]].</ref> Published throughout the 1970s and early 1980s under the title "Chief Priest Say", these columns were extensions of Kuti's famous Yabi Sessions—consciousness-raising word-sound rituals, with himself as chief priest, conducted at his Lagos nightclub. Organized around a militantly [[Afrocentric]] rendering of history and the essence of black beauty, "Chief Priest Say" focused on the role of [[cultural hegemony]] in the continuing subjugation of Africans. Kuti addressed many topics, from fierce denunciations of the Nigerian Government's criminal behavior, Islam and Christianity's exploitative nature, and evil multinational corporations; to deconstructions of Western medicine, [[Islam in the African diaspora|Black Muslims]], sex, pollution, and poverty. "Chief Priest Say" was eventually canceled by ''The Daily Times'' and ''The Punch''. Many have speculated that the paper's editors were pressured to stop publication, including threats of violence.{{Citation needed|date=January 2019}}

Kuti's lyrics expressed his inner thoughts.

In 1978 Kuti became a [[Polygamy|polygamist]] when he simultaneously married 27 women.<ref name=":1a">{{cite book |last=Collins |first=John |title=Fela: Kalakuta Notes |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CmBcCAAAQBAJ |publisher=Wesleyan University Press |date=5 June 2015 |isbn=9780819575401}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Carlos |last2=Gil |first2=Gilberto |title=Fela: This Bitch of a Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbMDyvjYIyMC |publisher=Chicago Review Press |date=1982 |isbn=9781556528354}}</ref> The highly publicized wedding served many purposes: it marked the one-year anniversary of Kuti and his wives surviving the Nigerian government's attack on the Kalakuta Republic in 1977,<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Washington|first=Teresa N.|title=The Architects of Existence: Aje in Yoruba Cosmology, Ontology, and Orature|publisher=Oya's Tornado|year=2014|isbn=978-0991073016|location=|pages=218}}</ref> and also formalized Kuti's relationships with the women living with him; this legal status prevented the Nigerian government from raiding Kuti's compound on the grounds that Kuti had kidnapped the women.<ref name=":0"/> Kuti also described polygamy as logical and convenient: "A man goes for many women in the first place.

In his songs "J.J.D. (Johnny Just Drop)" and "Gentleman", Kuti mocks African men's culturally and politically inappropriate adoption of European standards and declares himself "African man: Original".<ref name=":0" />

Kuti was also an outspoken critic of the United States. At a meeting during his 1981 [[Amsterdam]] tour, he "complained about the psychological warfare that American organizations like [[ITT Inc.|ITT]] and the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] waged against developing nations in terms of language". Because terms such as [[Third World]], [[Undeveloped countries|undeveloped]], or—even worse—[[Non-Aligned Movement|non-aligned countries]] imply inferiority, Kuti felt they should not be used.<ref name=":1a"/>

{{more citations needed|section|date=January 2019}}
Kuti is remembered as an influential icon who voiced his opinions on matters that affected the nation through his music. Since 1998, the [[Felabration]] festival, an idea pioneered by his daughter [[Yeni Kuti]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thenewsnigeria.com.ng/2019/09/22/felabration-2019-how-we-came-about-the-theme-from-lagos-with-love-yeni-kuti/|title=Felabration 2019: How We Came About the Theme, 'From Lagos, With Love!'  – Yeni Kuti|website=The News|date=22 September 2019|access-date=6 November 2021}}</ref> is held each year at at the [[New Afrika Shrine]] to celebrate the life of this music legend and his birthday. Since Kuti's death in 1997, there has been a revival of his influence in music and popular culture, culminating in another re-release of his catalog controlled by [[Universal Music Group|UMG]], [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and [[off-Broadway]] biographically based shows, and new bands, such as [[Antibalas]], who carry the Afrobeat banner to a new generation of listeners.

In 1999, [[Universal Music France]], under Francis Kertekian, remastered the 45 albums that it owned and released them on 26 compact discs. These titles were licensed globally, except in [[Nigeria]] and [[Japan]], where other companies owned Kuti's music. In 2005, the American operations of UMG licensed all of its world-music titles to the UK-based label [[Wrasse Records]], which repackaged the same 26 discs for distribution in the [[United States]] (where they replaced the titles issues by [[MCA Records|MCA]]) and the UK. In 2009, Universal created a new deal for the US and [[Europe]], with [[Knitting Factory Records]] and [[PIAS Recordings|PIAS]] respectively, which included the release of the Broadway cast recording of the musical ''[[Fela!]]'' In 2013, FKO Ltd., the entity that owned the rights to all of Kuti's compositions, was acquired by [[BMG Rights Management]].

In 2003, the ''Black President'' exhibition debuted at the New Museum for Contemporary Art, New York, and featured concerts, symposia, films, and 39 international artists' works.<ref>[http://archive.newmuseum.org/index.php/Detail/Occurrence/Show/occurrence_id/403 "Black President: the Art and Legacy of Fela Anikulapo-Kuti"], New Museum Digital Archive.</ref><ref name=":1a"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bombmagazine.org/article/5518/black-president-the-art-and-legacy-of-fela-anikulapo-kuti-new-museum-of-contemporary-art|title= —Black President: The Art and Legacy of Fela Anikulapo Kuti, New Museum of Contemporary Art|author= Koirala, Snigdha |website=BOMB Magazine |access-date=29 November 2016}}</ref>

The 2007 film ''[[The Visitor (2007 drama film)|The Visitor]]'', directed by Thomas McCarthy, depicted a disconnected professor ([[Richard Jenkins]]) who wanted to play the [[djembe]]; he learns from a young Syrian ([[Haaz Sleiman]]) who tells the professor he will never truly understand African music unless he listens to Kuti. The film features clips of Kuti's "Open and Close" and "''Je'nwi Temi'' (Don't Gag Me)".
