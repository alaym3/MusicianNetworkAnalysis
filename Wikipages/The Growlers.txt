==History==

Singer Brooks Nielsen and music director/guitarist Matt Taylor met in middle school in the beach town of Dana Point, California, bonding over surfing, skating, and partying.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smashboxstudios.com/hype/growlers-southern-californias-beach-goth-beatles-mania/|title=The Growlers are Southern California's Beach Goth Beatles, Mania and All|last=Salek|first=Yassi|date=November 4, 2014|website=smashboxstudios.com|language=en-GB}}</ref> When offered the chance to perform at a house party, the duo quickly wrote their first six songs in a single day, leading to the first incarnation of the band that would eventually become The Growlers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.laweekly.com/the-growlers-have-a-shot-at-the-big-time-but-it-makes-them-feel-a-bit-uneasy/|title=The Growlers Have a Shot at the Big Time, But it Makes Them Feel a Bit Uneasy|last=Flanders|first=Kai|date=April 19, 2012|website=laweekly.com|language=en-GB}}</ref> 

After releasing a handful of self-recorded cassettes and CDs, The Growlers issued their first studio album, ''Are You in or Out?'' in 2009 on Everloving Records. Aquarium Drunkard described it as “consistent in sound and tone that is as enjoyable straight through or on shuffle… Taken as a whole, the record is a beautiful mix of late 60’s freak-out, folk calmness and surf rock.” <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aquariumdrunkard.com/2009/10/05/the-growlers-are-you-in-or-out/|title=The Growlers :: Are You In Or Out?|last=Kramer|first=B=October 5, 2009|website=aquariumdrunkard.com|date=October 5, 2009|language=en-GB}}</ref> Their second album, ''Hot Tropics'', was released in 2010, also on Everloving Records.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thegrowlers.com/about|title=Growlers: About|access-date=October 31, 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111024192555/http://thegrowlers.com/about|archive-date=October 24, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/uponsun/2011/04/qa_the_growlers_brooks_nielsen.php|title=Q&A: The Growlers' Brooks Nielsen Talks Getting Drunk, Being Weird and Bill Murray|work=Phoenix New Times|access-date=June 4, 2013}}</ref> The band's third album, ''[[Hung at Heart]]'', the first to feature Anthony Braun Perry on bass and Jason Kaiser on percussion, was released in 2013.<ref name="everloving.com">[http://www.everloving.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=736:hung-at-heart&catid=1&Itemid=100004 Hung At Heart] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108091211/http://www.everloving.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=736:hung-at-heart&catid=1&Itemid=100004 |date=November 8, 2014 }}.
