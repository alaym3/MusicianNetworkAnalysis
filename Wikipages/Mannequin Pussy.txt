{{short description|American punk rock band}}
'''Mannequin Pussy''' is an American [[punk rock|punk]] and [[Indie rock|indie rock]] band from [[Philadelphia]]. They have released three albums; ''Mannequin Pussy'' (2014) and ''Romantic'' (2016) on [[Tiny Engines]], and ''Patience'' (2019) on [[Epitaph Records]]. Their recent EP, ''Perfect'', was released in 2021 to favorable reviews.

==History==
===2010–2015: Early career and ''Gypsy Pervert/Mannequin Pussy''===
Mannequin Pussy was formed in October 2010 by friends Marisa "Missy" Dabice and Athanasios Paul, who met when they went to school together. The band was initially a two-piece, with Dabice as the guitarist/singer and Paul as the drummer. In 2011 they released two EPs, titled ''Bonerjamz!'' and ''Meatslave''. One of their songs, "Clue Juice", appears on "Leisure Rules", a cassette-only compilation released in July 2012 on the Reeks Of Effort label on [[Bandcamp]]. In the same month, thirteen of their songs were released on one side of a split tour cassette called "Banditos", with Idaho band Art Fad on the Trash Palace Tapes label. 

At the beginning of 2013, Drew Adler joined the band as a drummer and Paul moved to guitar. Their first full-length album, ''Gypsy Pervert'' was released in October 2013, as a limited edition, cassette-only release on the Rarebit Records label. In November 2013, one of their songs appeared on ''The Le Sigh Vol. 1 Compilation''.<ref name="thelesigh">{{cite web|last1=Cirullo|first1=Diana|title=MONDAY MIX: THE LE SIGH VOL. 1|url=http://www.thelesigh.com/2013/12/monday-mix-le-sigh-vol-1.html|publisher=The Le Sigh|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref> 

In 2014, Mannequin Pussy signed with [[Tiny Engines]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Shrum|first1=Tony|title=Mannequin Pussy Joins Tiny Engines, Premieres Video; Debut LP Coming Soon|url=http://www.newnoisemagazine.com/mannequin-pussy-joins-tiny-engines-premieres-video-debut-lp-coming/|publisher=New Noise Magazine|archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:42l8ZsowWBoJ:newnoisemagazine.com/mannequin-pussy-joins-tiny-engines-premieres-video-debut-lp-coming/+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|archivedate=January 22, 2017}}</ref> That same year, Mannequin Pussy re-released their debut album on the label titled ''Gypsy Pervert''.<ref name="punknews">{{cite web|title=Mannequin Pussy: Gypsy Pervert (2014)|url=https://www.punknews.org/review/12868/mannequin-pussy-gypsy-pervert|publisher=Punknews|accessdate=16 February 2017}}</ref> It was later renamed to the self-titled ''Mannequin Pussy'' after the band regretted the use of the word "gypsy", which is often used as pejorative against [[Romani people]].

===2015–2021: ''Romantic'' and ''Patience''===
In 2015, Kaleen Reading joined the band as drummer, replacing Drew Adler. In 2016, bassist, Colins "Bear" Regisford joined the line-up as a bassist.
