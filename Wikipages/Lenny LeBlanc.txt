'''Lenny LeBlanc''' (born June 17, 1951)<ref name="LarkinGE">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Guinness Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|date=1992|edition=First|isbn=0-85112-939-0|page=1445}}</ref> is an American musician and songwriter. He started his career with [[Pete Carr]] in 1975 and later separated ways when both had different plans for their profession. A resident of Alabama, he is known for the song "[[Falling (LeBlanc and Carr song)|Falling]]"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=17022 |title=SongFacts.com |publisher=SongFacts.com |date=October 20, 1977 |accessdate=January 30, 2012}}</ref> and has sung with many artists. Since 1987, LeBlanc works at his own studio in [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]].

==Early life==
He was born in [[Leominster, Massachusetts]], United States.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1955, his family moved south to [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. LeBlanc spent his summers on the beach surfing until he met some teens who played guitars. He later landed a job washing dishes to pay for his first bass guitar. During the next three years of school, LeBlanc played at dances and local clubs around Daytona, developing his vocal talents as well.  He graduated from high school in 1969 and moved to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] in 1970. He has resided in [[Florence, Alabama]] since 1973.

==Musical career==
[[File:Don Moen and Lenny LeBlanc 1.jpg|thumb|LeBlanc performing together with [[Don Moen]]]]
Former band member and good friend [[Pete Carr]] had become a successful producer and studio guitarist in Muscle Shoals, Alabama.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> He encouraged LeBlanc to join him there. After a few months LeBlanc began playing bass as well as singing background vocals with artists such as [[Hank Williams Jr.]], [[Crystal Gayle]], [[Etta James]], [[Shenandoah (band)|Shenandoah]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Sawyer Brown]], [[The Supremes]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Amy Grant]] and [[Roy Orbison]].

With much success as a background musician and singer, LeBlanc embarked on a solo career.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1975, he recorded a demo and producer Carr sent a copy to [[Jerry Wexler]] at [[Atlantic Records]]. A few months later LeBlanc's first solo LP was released. Atlantic saw great potential in LeBlanc and teamed him with Carr. The result was three chart singles, including the top 40 hit "[[Falling (LeBlanc and Carr song)|Falling]]".<ref name="LarkinGE"/> LeBlanc and Carr began touring with major acts. After a while Carr decided he enjoyed making the records more than promoting them so the duo went their separate ways.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> LeBlanc continued writing songs and pursuing a solo effort, this time with [[Capitol Records]].

On the ''[[American Top 40]]'' show of February 25, 1978, [[Casey Kasem]] reported that LeBlanc and Carr had been bumped from the [[1977 Convair CV-240 crash|ill-fated flight]] which killed some of the members of rock band [[Lynyrd Skynyrd]]. The acts were touring together, and last-minute travel plan changes prevented the duo from boarding the plane after they had initially been offered seats.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

In 1980, LeBlanc became a [[born-again Christian]] and began recording Christian-themed music.<ref name="LarkinGE"/> In 1983, Heartland Records released ''Say a Prayer'' followed by ''Person to Person'' in 1984. In 1987, LeBlanc opened his own recording studio in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, where he does his own productions as well as others.
