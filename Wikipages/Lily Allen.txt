She is the daughter of actor [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith Allen]] and film producer [[Alison Owen]]. Her music career began in 2005 when she made some of her vocal recordings public on [[Myspace]] and the publicity resulted in airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]] and a contract with [[Regal Recordings]].  Her first mainstream single, "[[Smile (Lily Allen song)|Smile]]", reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in July 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=6|title=All the No. 1s|access-date=23 November 2009|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5QfBXZGIn?url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_the_no1_songs.php?show=6|archive-date=28 July 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> Her debut record, ''[[Alright, Still]]'', was well received, selling over 2.6 million copies worldwide and bringing Allen nominations at the [[Grammy Awards]], the [[Brit Awards]], and the [[MTV Video Music Awards]].

In 2009, her second studio album—''[[It's Not Me, It's You]]''—saw a genre shift, having more of an [[electropop]] feel, rather than the [[ska]] and [[reggae]] influences of the first one. The album debuted at number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]] and the [[ARIA Charts|Australian ARIA Charts]] and was well received by critics, noting the singer's musical evolution and maturity. It spawned the hit singles "[[The Fear (Lily Allen song)|The Fear]]", “[[Not Fair]]” and "[[Fuck You (Lily Allen song)|Fuck You]]". This success saw her receive the [[Brit Awards|Brit Award]] for British Female Solo Artist at the [[2010 Brit Awards]]. Allen and [[Amy Winehouse]] were credited with starting a process that led to the "year of the women" media label in 2009 that saw five female artists making music of "experimentalism and fearlessness" nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/the-rise-of-a-new-wave-of-female-singers-j3r795zbrg6|title=The rise of a new wave of female singers|last=Cairns|first=Dan|work=[[The Times]]|date=26 July 2009|access-date=30 May 2019}}</ref> She has released two further albums: ''[[Sheezus]]'' (2014), which debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, and ''[[No Shame (Lily Allen album)|No Shame]]'' (2018) debuting at number eight.

Allen also ventured into other careers; in 2008, she hosted her own television talk show, ''[[Lily Allen and Friends]]'', on [[BBC Three]] before launching her own record label, [[In the Name Of (record label)|In the Name Of]] in 2011.<ref name="Recordlabel">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jan/21/lily-allen-launches-record-label|title=Lily Allen launches own record label|first=Sean|last=Michaels|work=The Guardian|location=London|date=21 January 2011|access-date=29 December 2011}}</ref> In 2018, Allen released her autobiographical book, ''[[My Thoughts Exactly]].''<ref>{{Cite web|last=Sodomsky|first=Sam|date=15 August 2018|title=Lily Allen Details Memoir My Thoughts Exactly|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/lily-allen-details-memoir-my-thoughts-exactly/|access-date=3 August 2020|website=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|language=en-us}}</ref> Allen has since resumed her screen acting career from 1998;<ref name=":0" /> she appeared in the 2019 film ''[[How to Build a Girl]]''.

Allen attended 13 schools, including Prince Charles's junior alma mater, the [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|Independent]] [[Hill House School]], [[Millfield]], [[Bedales School]]<ref name="BBC News"/> and was expelled from several of them for drinking and smoking.<ref name="NYTimes0209">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/08/arts/music/08ryzi.html?partner=permalink&exprod=permalink|title=This Wild Girl's a Homebody Now|last=Ryzik|first=Melena|work=The New York Times|date=4 February 2009|access-date=6 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/lily-allen-admits-to-giving-a-blowjob-and-getting-expelled-20070524|title=Lily Allen Admits to Giving a Blowjob and Getting Expelled|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=24 May 2007|access-date=12 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=28 May 2007|title=Lily Allen Was Kicked Out of School For Sexual Services|url=https://www.femalefirst.co.uk/music/musicnews/Lily+Allen-35181.html|access-date=12 September 2012|work=Female First}}</ref> When Allen was eleven, former [[University of Victoria]] music student [[Rachel Santesso]] overheard Allen singing "[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]" by [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] in the school's playground; impressed, Santesso, who later became an award-winning soprano and composer, called Allen into her office the next day and started giving her lunchtime singing lessons.

Allen told ''[[Loveline]]'' that the audience was "brought to tears at the sight of a troubled young girl doing something good". At that point Allen said she knew that music was something she needed to do either as a lifelong vocation or to get it out of her system. She played the piano to [[Grade (music)|grade]] 5 standard and achieved grade 8 in singing. Allen also played violin, guitar and trumpet and was a member of a chamber choir. Her first solo was "[[In the Bleak Midwinter]]".<ref name="Uncertain Smile"/> She appeared as a [[lady-in-waiting]] in the 1998 film ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'', which was co-produced by her mother. That same year, Allen appeared in the music video to the [[Fat Les]] song "[[Vindaloo (song)|Vindaloo]]". She dropped out of school at age fifteen, not wanting to "spend a third of her life preparing to work for the next third of her life, to set herself up with a pension for the next third of her life."<ref name="observer"/>

==Career==
===2002–2005: Career beginnings===
When her family went to Ibiza on holiday, Allen told her mother that she was staying with friends but remained in [[Sant Antoni de Portmany]] instead. She earned money by working at a Plastic Fantastic record store and dealing [[MDMA|ecstasy]].<ref name="observer">{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/omm/story/0,,1776732,00.html|title=Pictures of lily|last=Sawyer|first=Miranda|work=The Observer|date=21 May 2006|access-date=24 July 2011}}</ref> Allen met her first manager, [[George Lamb (presenter)|George Lamb]] in [[Ibiza]].<ref name="observer"/> She was rejected by several labels, which she attributed to her drinking and being the daughter of Keith Allen.

Allen began writing songs, while her manager introduced her to production duo Future Cut in 2004. They worked in a small studio in the basement of an office building.<ref name="urb"/>

In 2005, Allen was signed to [[Regal Recordings]]; they gave her £25,000 to produce an album, though they were unable to provide much support for it due to their preoccupation with other releases such as ''[[X&Y]]'' ([[Coldplay]]) and ''[[Demon Days]]'' ([[Gorillaz]]).<ref name="pitchfork">{{cite web|last=Plagenoef|first=Scott|date=6 November 2006|title=Interviews: Lily Allen|url=https://pitchfork.com/features/interviews/6476-lily-allen/|access-date=24 July 2011|work=Pitchfork}}</ref> Allen then created an account on MySpace and began posting demos that she recorded in November 2005.<ref name="pitchfork"/> The demos attracted thousands of listeners, and 500 limited edition [[7-inch]] vinyl singles of "[[LDN (song)|LDN]]" were rush-released, reselling for as much as £40.<ref name="observer"/><ref name="pitchfork"/> Allen also produced two mixtapes – ''My First Mixtape'' and ''My Second Mixtape'' – to promote her work. As she accumulated tens of thousands of MySpace friends, ''The Observer Music Monthly'' (OMM), a magazine published in ''[[The Observer]]'', took interest in March 2006.<ref name="observer"/> Few people outside of her label's [[A&R]] department knew who she was, so the label was slow in responding to publications wanting to report about her.<ref name="pitchfork"/> She received her first major mainstream coverage, appearing in the magazine's cover story two months later.

===2006–2008: ''Alright, Still''===
[[File:Lily Allen @ Solidays 2007.jpg|thumb|Allen in 2007]]
The success convinced her label to allow her more creative control over the album and to use some of the songs that she had written instead of forcing her to work with mainstream producers. Allen decided to work with producers [[Greg Kurstin]] and [[Mark Ronson]], finishing the rest of the album in two weeks.<ref name="pitchfork"/> Allen's debut album, ''[[Alright, Still]]'', was released in July 2006. Most of the tracks had been previewed on her MySpace page, including the singles "[[Smile (Lily Allen song)|Smile]]", "[[LDN (song)|LDN]]", "Knock 'Em Out", and "Alfie". In September 2006, "Smile" was made available on the US version of [[iTunes Music Store|iTunes Store]]. By December 2006, her music video for ''Smile'' had been played on various music channels as well as the song getting a little airplay. ''Entertainment Weekly'' named ''Alright, Still'' as one of the top 10 albums of 2006 despite the fact that it had not yet been released in the US. Allen also did several promotional ads for MTV as their ''Discover and Download'' artist of the month for January 2007.

==Personal life==

Allen has spoken publicly about her seven-year stalking ordeal and the effect it had on her life. Her stalker, Alex Gray, first made contact with Allen in 2008 when he sent her a series of [[Twitter|tweets]], claiming he had written her song "[[The Fear (Lily Allen song)|The Fear]]", under the [[Twitter]] handle "@lilyallenisRIP". He then sent Allen threatening letters to her home, her clothes shop, her record label and her manager's office.<ref>{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Lily|date=20 September 2018|title=[[My Thoughts Exactly]]|publisher=[[Blink Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-911-60089-3}}</ref> In October 2015, he sent an email to his mother stating he was planning on murdering a celebrity, spent nights in her back garden, broke into her bedroom whilst she was sleeping and ultimately forced Allen to move. She has strongly criticised the [[Metropolitan Police]] for their inaction in the case, which included refusals to show Allen a picture of her stalker, lending her a [[panic button|panic alarm]] before demanding it back and refusal to believe stalking incidents were linked.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/16/lily-allen-stalked-singer-police|title=Lily Allen on being stalked: 'I was asleep.

At Harrow Crown Court on 10 June, Judge Martyn Barklem sentenced him to an indefinite hospital order. Gray was also made the subject of a restraining order and banned from entering the [[London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham]] or the [[Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-london-36496616|title=Singer Lily Allen's stalker sectioned|work=BBC News|date=10 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jun/10/lily-allen-stalker-alex-gray-mental-health-act|title=Lily Allen's stalker detained indefinitely under Mental Health Act|first=Lisa|last=O'Carroll|date=10 June 2016|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

Allen said that she isolated herself following the stalking incidents, believing that "nobody was taking me seriously because the police weren't taking me seriously". This coincided with her divorce, in which she says "everyone sided with [Cooper]", and her album ''No Shame'' became the outlet for her issues.<ref name="nme 2018">{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/lily-allen-big-read-interview-2018|title=Lily Allen: "People try to reveal the most intimate details of my life without permission.

Allen has been quite outspoken regarding her [[body image]] throughout her career. In an interview&nbsp;for ''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]'', an [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] [[Breakfast television|breakfast program]], Allen mentions that she "used to sleep for days so that [she] didn't eat" and that her relationship with her body was "not great" in her 20s. When asked about being influenced by the pressure of the [[music industry]] to "look a certain way in order to sell records," she replied that due to her defiant way of dealing with these unrealistic expectations, she was often criticized far more than the average [[musician]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lily Allen Blames Feeling Like a Bad Mother on Her Rock and Roll Lifestyle|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lq4crUhRt_g| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211030/Lq4crUhRt_g| archive-date=2021-10-30|date=12 July 2018|website=YouTube}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In January 2021, Allen gave an interview to discuss how she became addicted to the prescription drug [[Adderall]] in 2014 in order to lose weight before supporting Miley Cyrus on her [[Bangerz]] tour.<ref>{{Cite news|date=2021-01-15|title=Lily Allen opens up about addiction to Adderall for weight loss|language=en-GB|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-55679233|access-date=2021-01-31}}</ref> She began a journey of recovery soon after when she was tempted to try [[heroin]].

Allen's November 2013 video for "[[Hard out Here]]" was accused of being racist for its use of mostly black dancers in an allegedly "disapproving" manner.

[[Joe Strummer]], a close friend of Allen's father [[Keith Allen (actor)|Keith]], played mixtapes of [[Brazilian music]] and Jamaican [[reggae]] and ska when she was young.
