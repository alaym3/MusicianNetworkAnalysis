'''Nobu Hospitality, LLC''' is an [[United States|American]] [[Company]] founded by [[Nobu Matsuhisa]], [[Robert De Niro]] & [[Meir Teper]] in Partnerships with [[Drew Nieporent]] As an Operator with Myriad Restaurant Group.

== Background ==
In 1987, Nobu Matsuhisa moved to [[Los Angeles]] and opened the eponymous restaurant Matsuhisa. In 1988, Robert De Niro first visited the restaurant, and thereafter became a regular customer.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=Matsuhisa|first=Nobu|date=2017-11-13|title=How Robert De Niro Convinced Nobu to Build a Restaurant Empire|url=https://www.eater.com/2017/11/13/16599812/nobu-matsuhisa-robert-de-niro-memoir-excerpt|access-date=2020-11-16|website=Eater|language=en}}</ref> In 1989, De Niro suggested to Matsuhisa that he open a restaurant in [[Tribeca]], [[New York City]]. While Matsuhisa thought De Niro's proposal was attractive, he declined, feeling he should focus on establishing a solid foundation for his Los Angeles restaurant first. De Niro waited until 1994 before he floated the idea to Matsuhisa again, and this time Matsuhisa agreed.<ref name=":0"/>
