==Biography==
Flunk began as a project between Ulf Nygaard and Jo Bakke in [[Oslo]], Norway in late 2000 and early 2001. Beginning as an instrumental and sampled-vocal project, they were signed for a track on a compilation by [[Beatservice Records]] in the winter of 2001. On hearing the finished track, label manager [[Vidar Hanssen]] signed the still-unnamed band for a full album.<ref name="Flunk" />

During the summer of 2001, the duo recorded most of the album and Vister improvised the vocals. Afterward, Bakke layered the guitars, but it would be a year before the album was completed and released.<ref name="Flunk" />

In the spring of 2002, the band chose the name Flunk, and they released their first single, a cover of [[New Order (band)|New Order]]'s "[[Blue Monday (New Order song)|Blue Monday]]", in April. The track was well received in the UK and was included on numerous compilations in North America and Europe. Later in April, their debut album, ''[[For Sleepyheads Only]]'', was released, garnering positive reviews in Norway. With the success of this record, the [[BBC]] invited the group to do a recording session for the [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] show ''The Blue Room'' in London. Shortly after, the [[Notting Hill Arts Club]] would become the location of their live debut. In the United States, Flunk signed with [[Guidance Recordings]].<ref name="Flunk" />

By the summer of 2002, the band was getting rave reviews from British electronica magazines. In October, ''For Sleepyheads Only'' was released in the US. In November, Flunk played the [[London Jazz Festival]].<ref name="Flunk" />

In June 2003, Beatservice Records released ''Treat Me Like You Do - For Sleepyheads Only Remixed''. The band soon began work on their second album, recording in Paris in October.<ref name="Flunk" />

Flunk's sophomore studio effort, ''[[Morning Star (Flunk album)|Morning Star]]'', was finished in March 2004 and saw a Norwegian release in May and the rest of the world in June. In 2005, the EP ''[[Play America]]'' was released on Beatservice Records and included bonus tracks from the US version of ''Morning Star'', along with remixes.<ref name="Flunk" />

In 2007, Flunk released their third album, ''[[Personal Stereo]]'', while May 2009 saw the publication of ''This Is What You Get'', which includes a cover version of [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Karma Police]]".<ref name="Flunk" />

In 2013, the band released their fifth studio album, ''Lost Causes''. ''Cover Ups – The Home Recordings'', a covers album, came out in 2016, followed by ''Chemistry and Math'' in 2017.<ref name="Flunk" /> The band's latest record, ''History of Everything Ever'', hit the shelves in 2021.
