It also reached number one in [[List of number-one singles in Australia during the 1980s|Australia]] and [[List of number-one singles of 1982 (Canada)|Canada]]. In 1984, she reached number one in [[List of number-one singles of 1984 (Canada)|Canada]] and [[List of number-one hits of 1984 (Germany)|Germany]] with the U.S. No. 4 hit "[[Self Control (Raf song)#Laura Branigan version|Self Control]]". She also had success in the United Kingdom with both "Gloria" and "Self Control" making the Top 10 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Seeing her greatest level of success in the 1980s, Branigan's other singles included the Top 10 hit "[[Solitaire (Laura Branigan song)|Solitaire]]" (1983), the [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|U.S. AC]] chart number one "[[How Am I Supposed to Live Without You]]" (1983), the Australian No. 2 hit "[[Ti amo]]" (1984),  her return to the top 40 "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Laura Branigan version|The Power of Love]]" (1987), the top hit 15 dance "[[Shattered Glass (Laura Branigan song)|Shattered Glass.]]" Her most successful album was 1984's platinum-selling ''[[Self Control (album)|Self Control]]''. She also contributed songs to motion picture and television soundtracks, including the Grammy and [[Academy Awards|Academy Award-winning]] ''[[Flashdance]]'' soundtrack (1983), and the ''[[Ghostbusters]]'' soundtrack (1984), and also ''[[Miami Vice]]'' (1984). In 1985, she won the [[Tokyo Music Festival]] with the song "[[The Lucky One (Laura Branigan song)|The Lucky One]]". Her chart success began to wane as the decade closed and after her last two albums ''[[Laura Branigan (album)|Laura Branigan]]'' (1990) and ''[[Over My Heart]]'' (1993) garnered little attention, she generally retired from public life for the rest of the 1990s.<ref name = "Billboard" /> She began returning to performing in the early 2000s, most notably appearing as [[Janis Joplin]] in the [[off-Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Love, Janis (musical)|Love, Janis]]''. As she was recording new music and preparing a comeback to the music industry, she died at her home in August 2004 from a previously undiagnosed [[Intracranial aneurysm|cerebral aneurysm]].<ref name = "Billboard2" />

Branigan and her music saw renewed popularity and public interest in 2019 in the US after "[[Gloria (Umberto Tozzi song)|Gloria]]" was adopted by the [[National Hockey League|NHL]]'s [[St. Louis Blues]] as their unofficial victory song while they [[2018-19 St. Louis Blues season|completed a historic mid-season turnaround]] to [[2019 Stanley Cup Finals|win their first]] [[Stanley Cup]] in franchise history, leading to the song entering ice hockey lore as an "unlikely championship anthem".<ref name = "Forbes" /> Branigan's legacy manager and representative Kathy Golik embraced the trend and traveled to [[St. Louis]] to publicly represent Branigan among the Blues fanbase during the [[2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs]], later stating her belief that Branigan and "Gloria" "will forever be intertwined" with the Blues and the city of St. Louis.<ref name = "Intertwine" />

Branigan's maternal grandparents were William O'Hare, Jr. (son of William John O'Hare and Agnes B. O'Connor) and Mary Conway (daughter of Francis J. Conway and Mary Teresa McGuiness).

Branigan was raised in [[Armonk, New York]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2017/02/17/obit-armonk-pop-star-laura-branigan-corrected-again-12-years-later/98043530/|title=Obit for Armonk pop star Laura Branigan corrected again, 12 years later|website=Lohud.com|access-date=August 17, 2021}}</ref> and as a child attended a [[Catholic school]] in nearby [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]].<ref>{{cite news|work=[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]]|url=https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2017/apr/18/justice-for-laura-branigan-20170418/|title=Justice for Laura Branigan|last=Martin|first=Philip|date=April 18, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/wip/xBb6R|archive-date=July 5, 2021}}</ref> She attended [[Byram Hills High School]] from 1966 to 1970,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/spectrum_july10.pdf|title=Bryam Hills School District Spectrum|year=2010|volume=48|page=9|website=Byramhills.org|access-date=November 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527050744/http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/Spectrum_July10.pdf|archive-date=May 27, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> starring in the high school musical ''[[The Pajama Game]]'' in her senior year.<ref name="encyclopedia">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3492000017.html|title=Branigan, Laura|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=September 9, 2015}}</ref>

Between 1970 and 1972, Branigan attended the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York City,<ref name="encyclopedia"/> and supported herself by working as a waitress.

===1972–1980: Career beginnings===
In 1972, Branigan met acoustic guitarist Walker Daniels and his future wife Sharon Storm, and acoustic guitarist Chris Van Cleave, forming the folk-rock band ''Meadow''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancleavemusic.com/feature/home.html|title=Chris Van Cleave Singer-Songwriter-Actor Feature Page|website=Vancleavemusic.com|access-date=August 24, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150224041401/http://vancleavemusic.com/feature/home.html|archive-date=February 24, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 1973 the group, with bass player Bob Valdez, released their debut album ''The Friend Ship'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vancleavemusic.com/feature/Meadow%20story/Back%20of%20album.jpg|format=JPG|title=Photographic image of Meadow album sleeve credits|website=Vancleavemusic.com|access-date=November 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004928/http://www.vancleavemusic.com/feature/Meadow%20story/Back%20of%20album.jpg|archive-date=March 5, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> featuring the singles ''When You Were Young'', and ''Cane and Able'', which featured the hook line "Throw away your cane and you are able".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vinylvoyageradio.com/search/label/Meadow|title=The Vinyl Voyage|author=Bruce David Janu|work=vinylvoyageradio.com|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref><ref name="www.youtube.com">{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JhKTh4gcSRQ| title=The Friend Ship by MEADOW Ft Laura Branigan – Whole album|date=June 29, 2015|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> The record was not properly promoted and never re-released. The band broke up, after which Walker Daniels committed suicide. Branigan preferred not to discuss her involvement with Meadow publicly.

During the years after Meadow broke up, Branigan had various jobs, including a stint as one of [[Leonard Cohen]]'s backup singers for his European tour in April–August 1976.<ref name=sydney/>

Brannigan met attorney Larry Ross Kruteck (1936–1996) at a party in [[Manhattan]] in 1978, and they married in December of that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20136934,00.html|title=Facing the Music|work=People|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> He died of [[colon cancer]] on June 15, 1996.<ref name="cnn"/><ref name=people>{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20145395,00.html |title=Laura Branigan: 1957–2004 – The Singer Shot to Fame with ''Gloria'', but Gave It Up to Care for Loved Ones |date=September 13, 2004 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=62 |number=11 |access-date=April 11, 2011}}</ref>

In 1979, after a chance meeting with manager [[Sid Bernstein (impresario)|Sid Bernstein]] on her return from Europe, Branigan was signed by [[Ahmet Ertegun]] to [[Atlantic Records]].<ref name="cnn"/> For several years Atlantic had difficulty classifying Brannigan's powerful voice. Her pop single "[[Looking Out for Number One]]", from her unreleased album ''Silver Dreams'', made a brief appearance on the U.S. dance chart, reaching No. 60. Two other early Atlantic singles, "Tell Him" and "Fool's Affair", followed. None of these three singles (or the B-side, "When") were included on her first album, but all four songs were eventually released on CD over 30 years later in 2014 as bonus cuts on a U.S. CD reissue of Branigan's first album.

Branigan's 9-track debut album, ''[[Branigan]]'', was released in March 1982. The first single from the album was "[[All Night with Me]]", which reached No. 69 on the ''Billboard'' charts in early 1982. The album alternated four energetic up-tempo songs with five ballads, including one of the few songs written solely by Branigan, "I Wish We Could Be Alone". "[[Gloria (Umberto Tozzi song)#Laura Branigan version|Gloria]]", an Italian love song recorded in 1979 by [[Umberto Tozzi]] and successful in several European countries, was released as the album's second single. Branigan's version was reworked with Tozzi's own arranger, Greg Mathieson, who updated its production with fellow producer [[Jack White (producer)|Jack White]] to give it what Branigan called "an American kick" to match the new English lyrics. U.S. radio stations were initially unreceptive to "Gloria", but after it was embraced by dance clubs it eventually won them over, becoming one of the biggest hits of the 1980s. The album went gold, and the single was eventually certified platinum (sales of more than two million U.S. copies). Branigan's performance of "Gloria" was nominated for a [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] alongside [[Linda Ronstadt]], [[Olivia Newton-John]], [[Juice Newton]] and that year's winner, [[Melissa Manchester]], becoming her only solo nomination.

In the spring of 1983, Branigan released her second album ''[[Branigan 2]]''. Her vocals propelled her English-language version of the French song, "Solitaire" toward the top of the U.S. charts. The original "Solitaire" was written and recorded in 1981 by French singer-songwriter [[Martine Clemenceau]]. Two songs included on the album began the careers for two then-unknowns: the English translation of "Solitaire" was the first major hit for songwriter [[Diane Warren]], while the ballad "[[How Am I Supposed to Live Without You]]" was the first major hit for its co-writer, [[Michael Bolton]]. Branigan's version reached No. 12 on the hot 100 and spent three weeks at No. 1 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] adult contemporary chart.

=== 1981–1989: Mainstream success ===
{{Disputed section|date=November 2016}}
During the height of her career, Branigan also made acting appearances, first in 1981 in ''An American Girl in Berlin'' for West German television, and then after the success of "Gloria", guest appearances on American television series such as ''[[CHiPs]]'' ("Fox Trap", season 6, episode 16, in which she played Sarah, lead singer of the female rock band Cadillac Foxes),<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlgvvBG94ac&list=PLQmfNp8AukMMSDDp6TyG6Go6thGvyZXf4| title=Laura Branigan acting on "CHiPs" (1983) Part 1|date=July 24, 2015|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Automan]]'' and ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''. She would later appear in independent films including ''Mugsy's Girls'' (aka ''Delta Pi'', 1985) with [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winner [[Ruth Gordon]], and the Australian film ''[[Backstage (1988 film)|Backstage]]''. She sang on major national television and radio campaigns for products including [[Dr Pepper]], [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Chrysler]], which sponsored her 1985–1986 "Hold Me" tour.

The year 1984, while she was working with German producer [[Jack White (music producer)|Jack White]],<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ybu9Pw8t7dA| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/Ybu9Pw8t7dA| archive-date=2021-09-18|title=Laura Branigan - Evening Magazine interview|date=1985|via=YouTube|access-date=January 17, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-6NBJ65XMlE|title=Jack White accepts award on TV show Formel Eins|date=1984|via=YouTube|access-date=January 17, 2021}}</ref> was the height of the European [[synthpop]] era, and "[[Self Control (Raf song)#Laura Branigan version|Self Control]]", the title track of Branigan's third album, released in April 1984 became her biggest hit internationally, topping the charts in over six countries, most notably West Germany, where it spent six weeks at No. 1.  The original version was recorded a few months earlier, still in 1984, under the name of one of the song's co-writers "Raf" ([[Raffaele Riefoli]]), and held the West German number 2 spot during this time period; Branigan's version enjoyed more success outside of Raf's native Italy, hitting No. 4 in the U.S. The song was featured on episode No. 8 of the first season of the TV series, ''[[Miami Vice]]" titled "The Great McCarthy'', which aired on November 16, 1984. Other pop, disco, and adult contemporary hits from the ''[[Self Control (album)|Self Control]]'' album include "[[The Lucky One (Laura Branigan song)|The Lucky One]]" (which won her a [[Tokyo Music Festival]] prize), the continental ballad "[[Ti amo#Laura Branigan version|Ti Amo]]" (another Umberto Tozzi hit, and a No. 2 hit in Australia for Branigan) and the dance hit "[[Satisfaction (Laura Branigan song)|Satisfaction]]". The album also featured an understated version of [[Carole King]]'s "[[Will You Love Me Tomorrow|Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow]]"; as a counterpoint to all the dance productions, it was a bare-bones piano version. (In concerts and television appearances throughout her career, Branigan accompanied herself on the piano for the song.)

Branigan's vocal coach was Carlo Menotti, and she worked with [[Steve Lukather]] ([[Toto (band)|Toto]]), [[Dann Huff]] ([[Giant (band)|Giant]]) and [[Michael Landau]]; keyboardists Greg Mathieson, [[Harold Faltermeyer]], [[Michael Boddicker]] and [[Robbie Buchanan]]; bassists [[Nathan East]] and Dennis Belfield ([[Rufus (band)|Rufus]]); drummers Carlos Vega and [[Doane Perry]] ([[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]]); percussionists [[Paulinho Da Costa]] and Lenny Castro; and guest vocalists including [[Joe Esposito (singer)|Joe "Bean" Esposito]] and background vocalists including The Waters Sisters (Maxine and Julia), [[James Ingram]], and [[Richard Page (musician)|Richard Page]] and [[Steve George (keyboardist)|Stephen George]] ([[Mr. Mister]]).  As her stature grew, she attracted Grammy-winning producers including Phil Ramone, [[Richard Perry]] and [[David Kershenbaum]]. She performed duets with [[John Farnham]] as well as Latin pop artist [[Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri|Luis Miguel]].

In 1984, Branigan's live show was recorded twice, for a syndicated radio concert series and a concert video.  Branigan was also nominated for an award at the [[American Music Awards of 1985]] for favorite pop/rock female video artist, won by [[Cyndi Lauper]]. Also in 1985, Branigan performed the main theme song for the television mini-series ''[[Hollywood Wives (miniseries)|Hollywood Wives]]'', based on the novel by [[Jackie Collins]].

By the time Branigan's fourth album, ''[[Hold Me (Laura Branigan album)|Hold Me]]'' was released in July 1985, "Self Control" was a worldwide success. The hits continued with "[[Spanish Eddie]]", which was her sixth U.S. ''Billboard'' top 40 pop hit in two and a half years. The subsequent single release "[[Hold Me (Laura Branigan song)|Hold Me]]" was a U.S. top-40 dance hit, and Branigan's introduction of the rock ballad "[[I Found Someone]]" (co-written by [[Michael Bolton]], a later hit for [[Cher]]) scored even higher on the adult contemporary chart. However, neither song was supported by a music video, and both stalled at the low end of the [[Hot 100]] chart. On June 13, 1985, Branigan made her fourth appearance on legendary TV music show ''[[American Bandstand]]'', performing "Spanish Eddie" and "Hold Me".<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzuaK6r12YU| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/EzuaK6r12YU| archive-date=2021-09-18|title=Laura Branigan – Spanish Eddie, interview [cc] and Hold me 1985|date=January 25, 2014|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> On July 4, 1985, she performed in [[Point State Park]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Pennsylvania.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.775322645811113.1073741828.391763117500403&type=3|title=Concert at Point State Park, Fourth of July 1985 |work=facebook.com|access-date=August 24, 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref>
In February 1986, Branigan was invited for the first time to XXVII Festival Internacional De La Canción De Viña Del Mar in Chile, having a successful performance on the main stage and by television and thus increasing its popularity both in Chile and in the rest of Latin America.

Branigan's fifth album, ''[[Touch (Laura Branigan album)|Touch]]'' (released July 7, 1987) marked a change in her career. Under new management and using different producers, Branigan took a more active role in her work and in the studio, seeing her return to dancefloors with the [[Stock Aitken Waterman|Stock-Aitken-Waterman]]-produced track "[[Shattered Glass (Laura Branigan song)|Shattered Glass]]", written by Bob Mitchell and Steve Coe, of the band [[Monsoon (band)|Monsoon]]. "Shattered Glass" was performed by Branigan on the last episode of ''[[American Bandstand]]'' (hosted by [[Dick Clark]]) to be broadcast on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] (the show would last for two more years, first in [[Broadcast syndication|first-run syndication]] and finally on the [[USA Network]]) on September 5, 1987, becoming their last guest performer.<ref name="www.youtube.com"/> The album also included a return to the Billboard top-40 with her cover of [[Jennifer Rush]]'s "[[The Power of Love (Jennifer Rush song)#Laura Branigan version|Power of Love]]", which was one of the 20 bestselling singles in the U.S. during the Christmas season. The album's third single, "[[Cry Wolf (Laura Branigan song)|Cry Wolf]]", a top-30 AC hit, did not capture the attention of pop radio stations and stalled; the ballad was recorded two years later by [[Stevie Nicks]], and more recently by its writer [[Jude Johnstone]].

===1990–2000: Later career and hiatus===
Branigan's sixth album, ''[[Laura Branigan (album)|Laura Branigan]]'' (1990), brought her back to the [[Hi-NRG]] charts and gay clubs with "[[Moonlight on Water]]", and she scored a top-30 adult contemporary hit with "Never in a Million Years." Branigan added production to her list of credits with her cover of [[Vicki Sue Robinson]]'s disco-era "Turn the Beat Around" and the atmospheric "Let Me In," a cover of an [[Eddie Money]] song. The album also includes '"Unison,"<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-4KZPUV9c| url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103215748/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wC-4KZPUV9c| archive-date=2016-01-03 |title=Laura Branigan- Unison|date=April 11, 2013|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> which was the title track for [[Céline Dion]]'s English debut CD in the same year. The album's closing track, a cover of [[Bryan Adams]]' "The Best Was Yet to Come," was produced and arranged by Branigan. The 1990–1991 Laura Branigan Tour, which was kicked off with an appearance on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]'' on July 13, 1990<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bK3LUVhhTck| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/bK3LUVhhTck| archive-date=2021-09-18|title=Laura Branigan – Two Performances and Interview – The Tonight Show (1990)|date=July 18, 2015|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> was followed by a performance in the [[Trump Regency]] Showroom in Atlantic City, New Jersey on July 14,<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXFr-hqsVtk| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/yXFr-hqsVtk| archive-date=2021-09-18|title=Laura Branigan – Live in Concert 1990 (FULL CONCERT)|date=March 2, 2013|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref> and filmed for a syndicated U.S. television show ''[[Laura Branigan in Concert|SRO in Concert]]'', which was released on videocassette and laserdisc; on July 15, 1990 she performed at the [[Warwick Musical Theatre]] in Rhode Island.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1029081227101919.1073741834.391763117500403&type=3|title=LB's show in Warwick Musical Theater (1990) |work=facebook.com|access-date=August 24, 2015}}{{Primary source inline|date=October 2019}}</ref>
On Branigan's seventh and final studio album ''[[Over My Heart]]'' (August 17, 1993), the singer again produced (with [[Phil Ramone]]), and wrote and arranged. It included "Didn't We Almost Win It All" (by Branigan and Brian BecVar) (released as the first single), a cover of [[Cher]]'s song "[[Hard Enough Getting Over You]]" (released as the second single), a cover of the [[Patty Loveless]] single "[[How Can I Help You Say Goodbye]]", a cover of [[Roxette]]'s song "[[The Sweet Hello, The Sad Goodbye]]", and "Is There Anybody Here But Me?" (Pessis, Wells), a smooth mid-tempo number.

Branigan recorded a duet with [[David Hasselhoff]] which was hugely successful for being broadcast as the closing track of the ''[[Baywatch]]'' TV series. The single ''I Believe'' was originally released on CD album in 1994.<ref>[https://www.discogs.com/release/12853815 ''Baywatch'' CD (Compilation, 1994)] in Discogs.com</ref>

After 1990, Branigan's chart success cooled in the U.S., though she was still in demand around the world and went on several global tours. In 1994, not long after the release of ''Over My Heart'', Larry Kruteck, Branigan's husband (m. 1978), was diagnosed with [[colon cancer]]. Branigan refused to accept the medical prognosis, and left the music industry to devote her attention to him. Branigan put Kruteck on herbal treatments, eventually nursing him full-time. Kruteck survived for another two and a half years and died on June 15, 1996, after which Branigan stopped performing.<ref name=sydney>{{cite web|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|title=Laura Branigan obituary|date=August 30, 2004|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/music/laura-branigan-dies-at-47-20040830-gdjn6f.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/wip/IfeSR|archive-date=July 5, 2021}}</ref>

Branigan had official greatest hits collections released in South America, Japan, Germany, South Africa, and the U.S.; the U.S. collection was released in 1995. The 13-track ''[[The Best of Branigan]]'' included two newly-recorded covers: "[[Show Me Heaven]]" (written by [[Maria McKee]]) and the [[Donna Summer]] hit "[[Dim All the Lights]]," which Branigan released in several remixes.
On August 15, 1995, Branigan was a guest on the TV show ''Talking Food'', hosted by [[Robin Leach]] and broadcast by the [[Food Network]], and she promoted the album and sang "Dim All the Lights", before preparing her Summer Delight pasta dish on the show.<ref>{{cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uu_oRNTsxus| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/Uu_oRNTsxus| archive-date=2021-09-18|title=Laura Branigan – "Dim All The Lights" LIVE [cc] 1995|date=May 23, 2015|via=YouTube|access-date=August 24, 2015}}</ref>

In February 1996, she was selected to be part of the international jury at the [[:es:XXXVII Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar|XXXVII Festival Internacional de la Canción de Viña del Mar]], in Chile. Besides her duties as a jury member of this international musical competition, Branigan performed on Friday the 16th on the main stage for an audience who enthusiastically sang her greatest hits.

===2001–2004: Return to music===
In early 2001, Branigan's return to the stage was postponed, when she broke both of her [[femur]]s in a 10-foot fall from a ladder while she was hanging [[wisteria]] outside her three-bedroom lakeside home in [[Westchester County, New York]], resulting in physical therapy for six months.<ref name="cnn"/> In 2002, she performed twice as the "singing" [[Janis Joplin]] in the [[off-Broadway]] [[musical theater|musical]] ''[[Love, Janis (musical)|Love, Janis]]'', before dropping out of the show. "I left ''Janis'' because the producers failed to file with [[Actors' Equity Association|Equity]] properly," she told the ''[[Sunday News (Lancaster)|Sunday News]]'' in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. "I was sort of relieved. My voice isn't anything like Janis Joplin's, and there were 19 of her songs in the show."<ref name="CrispSunday">Crisp, Marty (August 1, 2002).

==Death==
Branigan died in her sleep at her lodge in [[East Quogue, New York]], on August 26, 2004, aged 52.<ref name=ap/> The cause was attributed to a previously undiagnosed [[intracranial aneurysm|ventricular brain aneurysm]].<ref name=ap/> It was reported that she had been experiencing persistent headaches for several weeks before her death, but had not sought medical attention for them.<ref name=ap>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/article/4ce78d41c83540e2b9b6b6b34a592158?mc_cid=ac1a251744&mc_eid=4e126a7e6a|work=[[Associated Press]]|title=Correction: Laura Branigan obituary|date=February 17, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/wip/t8Ixk|archive-date=July 5, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|title=Singer Laura Branigan Dies at 47|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/66707/singer-laura-branigan-dies-at-47|magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|access-date=May 10, 2018}}</ref> At the time of her death, it was widely erroneously reported that she was 47 years old, resulting from a technical error the [[Associated Press]] published after contacting Branigan's management company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/2016/12/16/obit-armonks-laura-branigan-corrected-12-years-later/95529382/|work=[[The Journal News]]|title=Obit for pop star Laura Branigan corrected, 12 years later|last=Gray|first=Madison J.|date=December 16, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://archive.today/wip/hHJgr|archive-date=July 5, 2021}}</ref>

==Legacy==
Branigan affectionately referred to her fans many times as her "other half." On the first anniversary of her death in 2005, many fans attended the first "Laura Branigan Spirit of Love Memorial Gathering" weekend, sponsored by Other Half Entertainment and LauraBraniganOnline.com and held near the Long Island home where she last lived, caring for her mother. The gathering then became an annual tradition.

Other Half Entertainment, Branigan's management company at the time of her death, continues to oversee her career legacy through her official website at www.LauraBraniganOnline.com, and her official MySpace and Facebook pages by taking part in various media opportunities, as well as through relationships with Warner Music Group and other entertainment industry entities, serving as the official voice for her legacy interests and keeping her artistic visions and standards at the heart of its operations.

Since 2006, Branigan's management company worked regularly with [[Warner Music Group]] entities in the production and release of various new greatest hits compilations. ''The Platinum Collection'' is an 18-song compilation including all the major hits as well as tracks such as "Silent Partners", Satisfaction," "All Night With Me," and "If You Loved Me," which were four relatively new additions to Branigan hits compilations.

In 2007, the 1995 album ''The Best of Branigan'' was re-released, as part of Rhino's 2007 "Greatest Hits" series of CDs. In 2009, Rhino/WEA authorized the re-release of three out-of-print Branigan albums: ''Touch'', ''Laura Branigan'', and ''Over My Heart''. In June 2010, ''[[Shine On: The Ultimate Collection]]'' was released, which, for the first time, incorporated a PAL only format DVD (will not play on most American DVD players) featuring official Atlantic music videos for 10 of Branigan's songs, in addition to an 18-track CD including "Forever Young", which made its return to the greatest hits compilations. The CD contains edited version (fades out early) of most songs.

At [[Byram Hills High School]] in [[Armonk, New York]], the Laura Branigan Memorial Scholarship is given annually to a senior for excellence in the performing arts.<ref>[http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/Spectrum_Summer09.pdf "2008–2009 High School Awards"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721004838/http://www.byramhills.org/files/filesystem/Spectrum_Summer09.pdf |date=July 21, 2011 }}.

On April 18, 2019, [[Jain (singer)|Jain]] debuted a single titled "Gloria" that is not a cover, but a tribute to Branigan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6P_7vlJHfak|title=Gloria|last=Jain – Topic|date=April 18, 2019|access-date=May 12, 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref>

Branigan's recording of "Gloria" played at the 2021 "Stop the Steal" rally immediately preceding the [[2021 storming of the United States Capitol|storming of the United States Capitol]].

==="Play Gloria" association with St. Louis Blues===
The [[St. Louis Blues]] [[National Hockey League|NHL]] team began using Branigan's version of "Gloria" as its unofficial victory song when they went on a franchise-record 11-game winning streak during the [[2018–19 St. Louis Blues season|2018–19 season]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhl.com/blues/news/gloria-the-story-behind-the-blues-new-old-postgame-victory-song/c-304750776|title=Gloria!

{{cquote|A club member kept yelling, "Play 'Gloria!'" and DJ Matt Cella obliged by putting on Branigan's catchy pop hit every commercial break. "They just went nuts when they heard it, and we loved watching it," Blues forward [[Robby Fabbri]] said. "So we just happened to get a win the next day and made it our win song." The next day the Blues went on to defeat the [[2018–19 Philadelphia Flyers season|Philadelphia Flyers]] in a 3–0 shutout. Jacks members say they have trademarked "Play Gloria" and they have sold over 700 shirts bearing the phrase.<ref name="CBCBlues" />}}

At the time, the Blues had the worst record in the league at 15–18–4, had fired head coach [[Mike Yeo]], called up rookie [[goaltender]] [[Jordan Binnington]] from the minor leagues to replace struggling starter [[Jake Allen (ice hockey)|Jake Allen]], and seemed bound for a lost season. Following their January 7 victory over the Flyers, which was Binnington's first NHL start, the Blues played "Gloria" in the locker room to celebrate their victory, with it then becoming a regular locker room ritual. When their stadium's DJ learned of it, he began playing the song in the stadium to rally the team.<ref name = "Billboard" /> From January 2019 the Blues would post a 30-10-5 record in the remaining games to finish at 45-28-9 and qualify for a playoff spot, eventually advancing to the [[2019 Stanley Cup Finals]], the teams' first Stanley Cup Final since [[1970 Stanley Cup Finals|1970]], where they defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] in 7 games to win their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. The dramatic turnaround in the Blues' fortunes following their adoption of "Gloria" led to it being embraced as their new victory anthem. The song is played at [[Enterprise Center]] every time the Blues win a game, leading to "Play Gloria!" becoming both a [[meme]] and victory chant for Blues fans. Local radio station [[KYKY|Y98]] played the song for 24 hours following the Blues' [[2019 Stanley Cup Playoffs|Game 7]] double-overtime 2–1 victory over the [[Dallas Stars]] on May 8 and again two weeks later on May 22 after its Game 6 5–1 win over the [[San Jose Sharks]] to win the Western Conference Championship and advance to the finals. After the Blues defeated the [[Boston Bruins]] in the Stanley Cup Finals, on June 12, Y98 played "Gloria" again for 24 hours. The bands [[Phish]] and [[Vampire Weekend]], who were both holding concerts in St. Louis on the night of Game 7, performed covers of "Gloria" when they learned the Blues had won the Cup.<ref name = "Billboard">{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/8515917/vampire-weekend-phish-cover-gloria-video-st-louis-blues|title=Vampire Weekend & Phish Cover Laura Branigan's 'Gloria' to Salute NHL Champs St. Louis Blues|magazine=Billboard}}</ref>
