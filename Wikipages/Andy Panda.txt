'''Andy Panda''' is a [[cartoon]] [[character (arts)|character]] who starred in [[List of Andy Panda theatrical cartoons|his own series]] of animated cartoon [[short subject]]s produced by [[Walter Lantz]].<ref>{{cite news|title= The Woodpecker and the Mouse : THE WALTER LANTZ STORY WITH WOODY WOODPECKER AND FRIENDS by Joe Adamson (Putnam's: $19.95; 254 pp., illustrated) and DISNEY'S WORLD by Leonard Mosley (Stein & Day: $18.95; 330 pp., illustrated) |work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1985-12-29/books/bk-25829_1_woody-woodpecker|access-date=November 22, 2011}}</ref> These "cartunes" were released by [[Universal Pictures]] from 1939 to 1947, and [[United Artists]] from 1948 to 1949.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lenburg |first1=Jeff |title=The Encyclopedia of Animated Cartoons |date=1999 |publisher=Checkmark Books |isbn=0-8160-3831-7 |access-date=June 6, 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780816038312/page/50/mode/2up |pages=50–51}}</ref> The title character is an [[anthropomorphic]] [[cartoon character]], a cute [[giant panda|panda]].<ref name="Book3">{{cite book | title=Serious business: the art and commerce of animation in America from Betty Boop to Toy story | publisher=Da Capo Press | author=Stefan Kanfer | year=2000 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/seriousbusinessa00kanf/page/113 113] | isbn=978-0-306-80918-7 | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/seriousbusinessa00kanf/page/113 }}</ref> Andy became the second star of the Walter Lantz cartoons after [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]. He achieved considerable popularity until being eventually supplanted by [[Woody Woodpecker]].

==History==
When Oswald the Lucky Rabbit retired in 1938, following a nine-year run, Walter Lantz's studio went for months without recurring characters. It wasn't until late 1937, when Lantz had a trip to a zoo. There, the main attraction of the place was a young panda which Lantz drew pictures of. He would then use his drawings to construct a new character.

Andy's first cartoon was the aptly titled ''[[Life Begins for Andy Panda]]'' in 1939. (This was obvious wordplay on the perky titles of the popular Andy Hardy movies of that era.<ref name="Book1">{{cite book | title=That's enough, folks: Black images in animated cartoons, 1900–1960 | url=https://archive.org/details/thatsenoughfolks0000samp | url-access=registration | publisher=Scarecrow Press | author=Henry T.

In the first three cartoons of the series, Andy's companion was a feisty turtle named Mr. Whippletree (voiced by Danny Webb) who was a caricature of [[Eddie "Rochester" Anderson|Eddie Anderson]]. And Papa Panda (voiced by Danny Webb<ref>{{cite web |title=Radio Round-Up: BABY SNOOKS - |url=https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/radio-round-up-baby-snooks/ |website=cartoonresearch.com |access-date=December 23, 2020 |date=February 6, 2019}}</ref> and then [[Arthur Q. Bryan]], [[Mel Blanc]] and Dick Nelson)—Andy's father— was often the [[fall guy]] for Andy’s pranks. When the turtle disappeared from the series, Papa began to function as both companion and foil.

Andy was at first a mischievous cub, whose blustery Papa is frequently trying to prove himself as a good role model. Later, Andy became a stand-alone star in the vein of [[Mickey Mouse]], and even acquired a [[Pluto (Disney)|Pluto]]-like [[dog]] named Milo as a pet.

The 1940 Andy Panda short ''[[Knock Knock (1940 film)|Knock Knock]]'' featured the first appearance of Lantz's most famous character, [[Woody Woodpecker]].<ref name="Book3"/>

By 1942, Andy Panda started wearing clothes and shoes in ''Nutty Pine Cabin''. The character was then given a major overhaul by director [[Shamus Culhane]] for the 1944 short ''The Painter and the Pointer'', with a far more malicious personality than he had ever shown previously, but this new version was disliked by both Lantz and audiences, and was not used again. Lantz continued to produce Andy Panda shorts until he closed his studio in 1949; Andy's last short was ''Scrappy Birthday'' (1949), which featured his girlfriend, Miranda Panda (voiced by [[Grace Stafford]]). When the studio reopened in 1950, the ''Andy Panda'' series never returned to production.

Andy led a major part of his career in comic books, in [[Dell Comics]]' ''Crackajack Comics'' and ''[[The Funnies|New Funnies]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rovin |first1=Jeff |title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals |date=1991 |publisher=Prentice Hall Press |isbn=0-13-275561-0 |access-date=April 8, 2020 |url=https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc00rovi/page/6/mode/2up/ |page=7}}</ref> One early Andy Panda comic book adventure was drawn by [[Carl Barks]] (''New Funnies'' 76, 1943). [[John Stanley (cartoonist)|John Stanley]] also did Andy Panda comic book work.

In two 1943 cartoons, ''Andy Panda's Victory Garden'' and ''Meatless Tuesday'', Andy's foil was a nameless rooster. In late 1943, this rooster became Andy's comic book sidekick, Charlie Chicken: "hatched" in ''NF'' 79 and rapidly growing into the cartoon model. Stories about Andy's and Charlie's often-bizarre adventures ran for many years. Some were reprinted domestically as recently as the 1990s, and in Sweden as recently as 2001.

==Other appearances==
Andy also appeared alongside Woody in shorts such as ''Banquet Busters'' and ''[[Musical Moments from Chopin]]''. He also had a cameo in ''[[The Woody Woodpecker Polka]]'' with Miranda Panda, Oswald Rabbit, and Charlie Chicken. In print, Andy Panda appeared in a Whitman Publishing 1943–1944 Better Little Book "Andy Panda and Tiny Tom" which differed from the usual Big Little Book format by having art on every page instead of art on alternate pages. Andy was scheduled to appear as a cameo in the film ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' at the deleted scene "Acme's Funeral". However, a gold colored Papa made the cut.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hill |first1=Jim |title=Storyboards reveal what Marvin Acme's funeral in "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" would have looked like |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2014/05/08/storyboards-reveal-what-marvin-acme-s-funeral-in-quot-who-framed-roger-rabbit-quot-would-have-looked-like.aspx |website=jimhillmedia.com |access-date=June 12, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>

The character appears in the new ''[[Woody Woodpecker (2018 web series)|Woody Woodpecker]]'' series voiced by Scott Weil. Andy also has a more mature voice with a Southern twang in this series.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5seQr1wMELc</ref>
