'''Stephen Lawrence Winwood''' (born 12 May 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and musician whose genres include [[blue-eyed soul]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[blues rock]], and [[pop rock]]. Though primarily a vocalist and keyboard player, Winwood  plays other instruments proficiently, including drums, mandolin, guitars, bass, and saxophone. 

Winwood was a key member of several major acts of the 1960s and 1970s, including [[the Spencer Davis Group]], [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], and [[Blind Faith]].  Beginning in the 1980s, his solo career took off and he had a number of hit singles, including "[[While You See a Chance]]" (1980) from the album ''[[Arc of a Diver]]'' and "[[Valerie (Steve Winwood song)|Valerie]]" (1982) from ''[[Talking Back to the Night]]'' ("[[Valerie (Steve Winwood song)|Valerie]]" became a hit when it was re-released with a remix from Winwood's 1987 compilation album [[Chronicles (Steve Winwood album)|Chronicles]]).  His 1986 album ''[[Back in the High Life]]'' marked his career zenith, with hit singles including "[[Back in the High Life Again]]", "[[The Finer Things (song)|The Finer Things]]", and the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] number one hit "[[Higher Love]]".  He found the top of the Hot 100 again with "[[Roll with It (Steve Winwood song)|Roll With It]]" (1988) from the [[Roll With It (album)|album of the same name]], and "[[Holding On (Steve Winwood song)|Holding On]]" also charting highly the same year.  While his hit singles ceased at the end of the 1980s, he continued to release new albums through 2008, when ''[[Nine Lives (Steve Winwood album)|Nine Lives]]'', his latest album, was released.  Since then, while he has not released any new albums, he still continues to tour alongside other [[classic rock]] acts, most recently in 2020 with [[Steely Dan]].

He was inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a member of Traffic in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rockhall.com/inductees/traffic|title=Traffic|website=Rockhall.com|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-date=2 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802153859/http://www.rockhall.com/inductees/traffic/|url-status=live}}</ref>  In 2005, Winwood was honoured as a [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Icon at the annual BMI London Awards for his "enduring influence on generations of music makers".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|title=BMI Honors Top European Writers, Publishers at 2005 London Awards; Steve Winwood Named a BMI Icon|website=Bmi.com|date=28 November 2005|access-date=15 September 2010|archive-date=14 January 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114065908/http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/334626|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked Winwood No. 33 in its 100 Greatest Singers of All Time.<ref>{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Singers of All Time|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/24161972/page/33|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=13 June 2009|quote=Steve Winwood exploded onto the London music scene as a teenager with his powerful, soulful tenor—notably on "Gimme Some Lovin'" and "I'm a Man" with the Spencer Davis Group.|archive-date=23 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090723104724/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/24161972/page/33|url-status=dead}}</ref> Winwood has won two [[Grammy Award]]s.

==Career==
===Early years===
[[File:SpencerDavisGroup1966RonKroon2.jpg|thumb|Winwood on organ with Spencer Davis Group (Amsterdam, 1966)]]
While still a pupil at Great Barr School, Winwood was a part of the Birmingham [[blues rock]] scene, playing the [[Hammond Organ|Hammond C-3 organ]] and guitar, backing [[blues]] and rock legends such as [[Muddy Waters]], [[John Lee Hooker]], [[Howlin' Wolf]], [[B.B. King]], [[Chuck Berry]], and [[Bo Diddley]] on their United Kingdom tours,<ref>[http://www.stevewinwood.com/ Official website Steve Winwood Official website] Retrieved 9 February 2021</ref> the custom at that time being for US singers to travel solo and be backed by [[pickup group|pick-up band]]s. At this time, Winwood was living on Atlantic Road in Great Barr, close to the Birmingham music halls where he played. Winwood modelled his singing after [[Ray Charles]].<ref name=soul/>

In 1964, they signed their first recording contract with [[Island Records]]. Producer and founder [[Chris Blackwell]] later said of Winwood, "He was really the cornerstone of Island Records. He's a musical genius and because he was with Island all the other talent really wanted to be with Island."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYU9U4Kw8KI|title=Bono Inducts Chris Blackwell into Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=26 February 2019|archive-date=23 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523081301/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYU9U4Kw8KI|url-status=live}}</ref> The group's first record, a single, was released 10 days after Winwood's 16th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-spencer-davis-group/uk |title=The Spencer Davis Group Discography - UK |website=45cat.com |access-date=18 April 2020 |archive-date=20 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220024116/http://www.45cat.com/artist/the-spencer-davis-group/uk |url-status=live }}</ref> The group had their first [[record chart|number one]] single at the end of 1965, with "[[Keep on Running]]";<ref>{{Pop Chronicles|52|4}}</ref> the money from this success allowed Winwood to buy his own [[Hammond organ]].<ref name="soul" /> Winwood co-wrote and recorded the chart-topping hits "[[Gimme Some Lovin']]" and "[[I'm a Man (The Spencer Davis Group song)|I'm a Man]]" before leaving the Spencer Davis Group in 1967.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stevewinwood.com/biography|title=Steve Winwood {{!}} Official Website|website=Steve Winwood|access-date=8 May 2018|archive-date=31 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180731071925/https://www.stevewinwood.com/biography|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Eric Clapton and Powerhouse===
Winwood joined forces with guitarist [[Eric Clapton]] as part of the one-off group [[Eric Clapton and the Powerhouse]]. Songs were recorded for the [[Elektra Records|Elektra]] label, but only three tracks made the 1966 compilation album, ''[[What's Shakin']]''.

===Traffic, Blind Faith, and Ginger Baker's Air Force===
[[File:Steve Winwood with Traffic.jpg|thumb|170px|right|Winwood with Traffic]]
Winwood met drummer [[Jim Capaldi]], guitarist [[Dave Mason]], and multi-instrumentalist [[Chris Wood (rock musician)|Chris Wood]] when they jammed together at [[The Elbow Room]], a club in [[Aston, Birmingham|Aston]], Birmingham.<ref name="brumbeat">{{cite web|url=http://www.brumbeat.net/traffic.htm|title=Traffic|access-date=4 March 2008|website=Brumbeat.net|archive-date=19 March 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319095312/http://www.brumbeat.net/traffic.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> After Winwood left the Spencer Davis Group in April 1967, the quartet formed [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]].<ref name=AMG>[{{AllMusic|class=artist|id=p5681/biography|pure_url=yes}} Traffic Biography] [[AllMusic]]</ref> Soon thereafter, they rented a cottage near the rural village of [[Aston Tirrold]], Berkshire (now [[Oxfordshire]]), to write and rehearse new music.<ref name="brumbeat"/> This allowed them to escape the city and develop their music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.winwoodfans.com/aston.htm|title=The Traffic Cottage at Aston-Tirrold at winwoodfans.com|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-date=28 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000557/http://www.winwoodfans.com/aston.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Early in Traffic's formation, Winwood and Capaldi formed a songwriting partnership, with Winwood writing music to match Capaldi's lyrics. This partnership was the source of most of Traffic's material, including popular songs such as "[[Paper Sun]]" and "[[The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys (song)|The Low Spark of High-Heeled Boys]]", and outlived the band, producing several songs for Winwood and Capaldi's solo albums. Over the band's history, Winwood performed the majority of their lead vocals, keyboard instruments, and guitars. He also frequently played bass and percussion, up to and including the recording sessions for their fourth album.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steve Winwood: Credits |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-winwood-mn0000045313/credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624150437/https://www.allmusic.com/artist/steve-winwood-mn0000045313/credits |url-status=live }}</ref> While still in Traffic, Winwood was brought in by [[Jimi Hendrix]] to play organ for "[[Voodoo Chile]]" on the ''[[Electric Ladyland]]'' album.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perry |first1=John |title=Jimi Hendrix's Electric Ladyland |date=2004 |publisher=A & C Black |isbn=0826415717 |page=77 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8cnK_rCKIAsC&pg=PA77 |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-date=18 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818203821/https://books.google.com/books?id=8cnK_rCKIAsC&pg=PA77 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Moskowitz |first1=David |title=The Words and Music of Jimi Hendrix |date=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-0313375927 |page=43 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dzUlWk-RvfgC&pg=PA43 |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819041111/https://books.google.com/books?id=dzUlWk-RvfgC&pg=PA43 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Winwood formed the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Blind Faith]] in 1969 with [[Eric Clapton]], [[Ginger Baker]], and [[Ric Grech]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/music/steves-still-winning-nine-lives-later-1483044.html|title=Steve's still winning nine lives later|work=Herald.ie|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-date=13 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213114929/http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/music/steves-still-winning-nine-lives-later-1483044.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The band was short-lived, owing to Clapton's greater interest in Blind Faith's opening act [[Delaney & Bonnie & Friends]]; Clapton left the band at the tour's end. However, Baker, Winwood, and Grech stayed together to form [[Ginger Baker's Air Force]]. The line-up consisted of 3/4 of Blind Faith (without Clapton, who was replaced by [[Denny Laine]]), half of Traffic (Winwood and [[Chris Wood (rock musician)|Chris Wood]], minus Capaldi and Mason), plus musicians who interacted with Baker in his early days, including [[Phil Seamen]], [[Harold McNair]], John Blood, and [[Graham Bond]].<ref name=Perciaccante>{{cite news |last1=Perciaccante |first1=Mike |title=Steve Winwood |url=http://www.madhousemagazine.com/steve-winwood |access-date=24 June 2018 |work=Madhouse Magazine |date=20 April 2017 |archive-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624121319/http://www.madhousemagazine.com/steve-winwood |url-status=live }}</ref>

However, this project also turned out to be short-lived. Winwood soon went into the studio to begin work on a new solo album, tentatively titled ''Mad Shadows''. However, Winwood ended up calling in Wood and Capaldi to help with session work, which prompted Traffic's comeback album ''[[John Barleycorn Must Die]]'' in 1970.<ref name=Perciaccante/>

In 1972, Winwood recorded the part of Captain Walker in the highly successful orchestral version of [[The Who]]'s ''Tommy''. He recorded a 1973 album with [[Remi Kabaka]], ''Aiye-Keta'', for [[Antilles Records]], and in 1976 provided vocals and keyboards on ''Go'', a concept album by Japanese composer [[Stomu Yamashita]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Leszczak |first1=Bob |title=Encyclopedia of Pop Music Aliases |date=2014 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1442240087 |page=385 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3u7iBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA385 |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-date=18 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818175615/https://books.google.com/books?id=3u7iBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA385 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1976, Winwood also played guitar on the [[Fania All Stars]]' ''Delicate and Jumpy'' record and performed as a guest with the band in their only UK appearance, a sold-out concert at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]], London.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fania Allstars: Delicate and Jumpy |url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/delicate-and-jumpy-mw0000339832/credits |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624150427/https://www.allmusic.com/album/delicate-and-jumpy-mw0000339832/credits |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Welch |first1=Chris |title=Steve Winwood: Roll with it |date=1990 |publisher=Perigee Books |isbn=0399515585 |page=133 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UU9EAAAAMAAJ&q=lyceum |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-date=20 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820001146/https://books.google.com/books?id=UU9EAAAAMAAJ&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=lyceum |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Solo career===
Weariness with the grind of touring and recording prompted Winwood to leave Traffic and retire to sessioning for some years.<ref name="Mojo">Black, Johnny (May 1997). [http://www.stevewinwood.com/news/5765 Feature: Steve Winwood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928165937/http://www.stevewinwood.com/news/5765 |date=28 September 2011 }}, ''[[Mojo (magazine)|Mojo]]''.</ref> Under pressure from Island Records, he resurfaced with his self-titled first solo album in 1977. This was followed by his 1980 hit ''[[Arc of a Diver]]'' (which included his first solo hit, "[[While You See a Chance]]") and ''[[Talking Back to the Night]]'' in 1982.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Both albums were recorded at his home in [[Gloucestershire]] with Winwood playing all instruments. He continued to do sessions during this period, and in 1983 he co-produced and played on [[Jim Capaldi]]'s top 40 hit "[[That's Love (song)|That's Love]]" and co-wrote the [[Will Powers]] top 20 hit "[[Kissing with Confidence]]".{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1986, he moved to New York. There he enlisted the help of a coterie of stars to record ''[[Back in the High Life]]'' in the US, and the album was a hit. He topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with "[[Higher Love]]," and earned two [[Grammy Award]]s: for Record of the Year and Best Male Pop Vocal Performance.

Winwood embarked on an extensive tour of North America in support of the album.<ref name="New York Times 1986">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/23/arts/the-pop-life-steve-winwood-returns-to-make-the-juices-flow.html|title=The Pop Life; Steve Winwood Returns To Make The Juices Flow|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=29 September 2014|archive-date=24 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524192353/http://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/23/arts/the-pop-life-steve-winwood-returns-to-make-the-juices-flow.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

All these albums were released on [[Island Records]]. However, at the peak of his commercial success, Winwood moved to [[Virgin Records]] and released ''[[Roll with It (album)|Roll with It]]'' and ''[[Refugees of the Heart]]''.
