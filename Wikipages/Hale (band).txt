'''Hale''' is a [[Filipinos|Filipino]] [[alternative rock]] band, formed in Manila, Philippines in 2004. The group originally consisted of singer and guitarist [[Champ Lui Pio]], bassist [[Jose Angelo Gellada|Sheldon Gellada]], guitarist Roll Martinez and drummer Omnie Saroca. This line-up remained unchanged until the departure of Saroca in 2008; he was then replaced by [[Join the Club (band)|Paolo Santiago]]. In March 2017, Chino David of [[Silent Sanctuary]] became the band's fifth member.

Hale signed to [[EMI]], now [[PolyEast Records]] in 2004 and released their self–titled debut album, ''[[Hale (album)|Hale]]'' (2005). The album was critically acclaimed; resulting in the accolade as the ''[[Awit Award]]''’s Group of the Year. The band’s debut album included the single "[[Hale (album)|The Day You Said Goodnight]]" which brought them mainstream success in [[Southeast Asia]]. The following year, the band released their second studio album ''[[Twilight (Hale album)|Twilight]]'' (2006) which received mostly positive reviews and critical success. The band released their third album ''[[Above, Over and Beyond]]'' (2008) which received generally mixed reviews and saw limited success. This is the last album featuring original drummer Omnie Saroca. Paolo Santiago (formerly of [[Join the Club (band)|Join the Club]]) subsequently replaced him as the band began recording their fourth studio album ''[[Kundiman (album)|Kundiman]]'' released in 2009.

In 2010, the group disbanded. Lead singer Champ Lui Pio announced his intention to begin a solo career as a musician and actor.

In January 2015 after weeks of speculation that the band was reuniting, the group held their first gig. Their first single in five years "See You" was debuted in early 2015 and their fifth album ''[[Hale discography|Time and Space]]'' under [[Warner Music Philippines]] was released via [[iTunes]] and [[Spotify]]. In 2016, the group collaborated with singer [[Sarah Geronimo]] for the song "[[The Great Unknown (Sarah Geronimo song)|The Great Unknown]]". It was written by the band's lead guitarist, Roll Martinez, for Geronimo's [[The Great Unknown (Sarah Geronimo album)|twelfth album]]. The song's music video peaked at no. 1 on both [[Myx|MYX Philippines]] and [[MTV|MTV Philippines]] charts.

== History ==

=== 2004–2005: Formation and early years ===
Roll Martinez and [[Jose Angelo Gellada|Sheldon Gellada]] were music majors from [[University of Santo Tomas]]. Champ Lui-Pio was from [[De La Salle University - College of Saint Benilde]]. Omnie Saroca was from [[Technological University of the Philippines]]. The four of them formed Hale in mid-2004, and soon after signed up with [[EMI|EMI Philippines]] (now PolyEast Records).

=== 2005–2006: ''Hale'' and mainstream success ===

In 2005, the band released their debut self–titled album ''[[Hale (album)|Hale]]'', consisting of singles, "[[Hale discography|Broken Sonnet]]", "[[Hale (album)|The Day You Said Goodnight]]", "[[Hale discography|Kahit Pa]]", "[[Hale (album)|Kung Wala Ka]]" and "[[Hale discography|Blue Sky]]" together with "Tollgate" which was released together with the re-issuing of the album on March 2, 2006. "The Day You Said Goodnight" marked the first steps of Hale's massive success to the mainstream and gained tremendous popularity as the singles were released. Their big hit single, "The Day You Said Goodnight” was also nominated many times by most of the music media as OPM Song of the Year of 2005. Soon, the band was also nominated as Band of the Year and Best new OPM group artist for 2005 in numerous music awards.

Hale re-issued their debut album together with the single "Tollgate" on March 2, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emimusic.ph/article/articleview/18/1/59|title=Hale repacks Hale|publisher=EMI Philippines|access-date=March 12, 2008}}</ref> At the same year, the debut album had reached 90,000 copies sold. They were also chosen to make a commercial endorsement for [[Nescafé|Nescafé Philippines]] and a jingle "One Moment, One Nescafé" written by them in promotion of the Nescafé products.

=== 2006–2008: ''Twilight'' to Treehouse Production and hiatus ===
Hale released their sophomore effort ''[[Twilight (Hale album)|Twilight]]'' on September 30, 2006, consisting of singles "Waltz", "Hide And Seek", "Shooting Star" and "The Ballad Of".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/cag/2006/10/04/life/hale.s.twilight.album.now.out.in.the.market.html|title=Hale's 'Twilight' album now out in the market|publisher=Sun Star|access-date=September 24, 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207134144/http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/cag/2006/10/04/life/hale.s.twilight.album.now.out.in.the.market.html|archive-date=December 7, 2007|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The music video of "Waltz" was also nominated many times as the Most Favorited Music Video in 2006, marking another step of Hale's success to the mainstream. The album was also certified Gold (15,000 copies sold) a week after its release.

It was said that the band encountered tremendous amount of pressure to record their sophomore effort. On the other hand, their effort was meant to reflect their success from the preceding album as a band where their musical influences and styles had encompassed a wider spectrum of musical arrangements.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.showbizpinoy.com/showbiz/news/nov_wk2_06/hale.htm|title=Hale "waltzes" into a 6th no.1 in a row|publisher=showbizpinoy.com|access-date=July 3, 2007}}</ref>

Having encountered pressure from the mainstream successes of their first two albums, the band self-imposed a 10-month hiatus. During then, they established the Treehouse Productions where they would help the needy children suffering from mental and physical illnesses through music. In the process, other music acts eventually signed up for Treehouse Productions to help the band achieve their objectives, such as [[Rico Blanco]] and [[Mayonnaise]].

=== 2008–2009: ''Above, Over And Beyond'' and the departure of Saroca ===

Soon after their hiatus, they released their third effort, ''[[Above, Over And Beyond]]'', which consisted of singles "Pitong Araw", "Leap Of Faith", "Over And Over (And Over Again)" and "Sandali Na Lang" on April 28, 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/1887/Hale-releases-third-EMI-album-Above,-Over-and-Beyond|title=Hale releases third EMI album "Above, Over and Beyond"|publisher=Philippine Entertainment Portal|access-date=May 1, 2008}}</ref> Even before the release of their third effort, "Sundown", which featured [[Tom Cruise]], was released as a jingle for the promotion of the local toothpaste product, [[Close-Up (toothpaste)|Close-Up]]. Despite expectations, album sales for the album was low due to economic woes of the band's music label, [[EMI|EMI Philippines]]. As a result, the band resulted in promoting the album independently which, however, saw limited success. Hence, just like ''[[Twilight (Hale album)|Twilight]]'', the success of the album did not come up to par with the former albums.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20090107-181994/Hale-far-from-saying-good-night|title=Hale far from saying 'good night'|publisher=inquirer.net|access-date=November 21, 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104165606/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/breakingnews/breakingnews/view/20090107-181994/Hale-far-from-saying-good-night|archive-date=November 4, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Hale drummer and percussionist Omnie Saroca left the band in the same year to focus on other issues outside the music industry. In turn, former drummer Paolo Santiago of Join the Club joined the band to replace Omnie Saroca in late 2008.

=== 2009–2010: ''Kundiman'' and final days ===

Their fourth and final album, ''[[Kundiman (album)|Kundiman]]'', released on July 28, 2009, the band started promoting their album soon after its release, about a month after the first single, ''Bahay Kubo'', went for radio airplay. Other singles include "Kalesa", "Harinawa", and "Magkaibang Mundo".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://haleofficial.com/blog/attention-all-halers/|title=Attention all HALERS - Champ|publisher=haleofficial.com|access-date=June 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://haleofficial.com/blog/carrier-single-of-kundiman-is-just-around-the-corner/|title=Carrier single of Kundiman...

Of all eight songs in the album, written in Tagalog. They also sought guidance with OPM band [[Mayonnaise (band)|Mayonnaise]]'s Monty Macalino in the song composition and arrangements of the album.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.titikpilipino.com/news/?aid=1320|title=Hale releases new CD entitled Kundiman|publisher=titikpilipino.com|access-date=August 10, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131210829/http://www.titikpilipino.com/news/?aid=1320|archive-date=January 31, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

=== 2010–2015: Break–up and side projects ===
The band announced that they are no longer interested to have gigs and producing more music. [[Champ Lui Pio]] announced his intention and interest in acting and being a solo music artist. Champ's decision to disband Hale was allegedly kept from his bandmates, who were not given prior notice and only learned of the break-up after his public announcement. The band officially went on their separate ways on August 6, 2010. It was announced through their official [[Facebook]] page.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/271087 |title=Hale-no-more |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826060852/http://www.mb.com.ph/node/271087 |archive-date=August 26, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/music/7312/ex-hale-frontman-champ-lui-pio-pursues-solo-career-with-synergy | title=Ex-Hale frontman Champ Lui Pio pursues solo career with Synergy | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209110152/http://www.pep.ph/guide/music/7312/ex-hale-frontman-champ-lui-pio-pursues-solo-career-with-synergy | archive-date=February 9, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

=== 2015–2017: Reformation and ''Time and Space'' ===
Rumors of the band reuniting, while not widespread, started online in mid-2014 until word became official that the band had reunited through their gig on January 13, 2015. This was also their first gig since their break-up in 5 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indiemanila.com/2015/01/hales-secret-set-at-12-monkeys.html|title=Hale's Secret Set At 12 Monkeys|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150120211508/http://www.indiemanila.com/2015/01/hales-secret-set-at-12-monkeys.html|archive-date=January 20, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Their first single "See You" debuted on January 27, 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152621148259327|title=The countdown begins.

In 2016, they collaborated with singer [[Sarah Geronimo]] for the song [[The Great Unknown (Sarah Geronimo song)|''The Great Unknown'']] which was written by the band's Roll Martinez. It was released as the second single from Geronimo's [[The Great Unknown (Sarah Geronimo album)|album with the same title]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Viva Records|title=Sarah Geronimo feat.
