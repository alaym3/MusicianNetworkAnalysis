==Early life==
Wynonna was born Christina Claire Ciminella in [[Ashland, Kentucky]], on May 30, 1964.<ref name="allmusic" /> She was given the last name Ciminella after Michael Ciminella, the man her mother quickly married after being abandoned by her boyfriend and Judd's biological father, Charles Jordan, who  died in 2000. Her younger half-sister is actress [[Ashley Judd]]. Naomi and Ciminella moved with the girls to Los Angeles in 1968 but were divorced by 1972.<ref name="allmusic" /> By 1976, Wynonna and Naomi were living in [[Kentucky]], where Wynonna took inspiration from the [[country music]] that her mother listened to and learned to play guitar after receiving one for Christmas. The two of them moved to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], in 1979 in pursuit of a musical career.

==The Judds==
{{Main|The Judds}}
Wynonna and Naomi were signed to [[RCA Records]] in 1983 as the duo [[the Judds]]. Between 1983 and 1991, the Judds charted 23&nbsp;hit singles on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Hot Country Singles (now [[Hot Country Songs]]) charts, including 14 number ones. They also recorded eight studio albums, one Christmas album and two Greatest Hits compilations. In their six-year career, the Judds sold more than 20 million records worldwide and had won over 60 industry awards, including five Grammy Nominations, nine [[Country Music Association]] awards (seven of them consecutive), and eight ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Music Awards.<ref name="Wynonna: Bio">{{cite web|url=http://www.wynonna.com/?content=bio |title=Wynonna: Bio |access-date=April 6, 2009 |work=Wynonna official website}}</ref> At the time, they were the biggest-selling duo in country music and remained so until they were eclipsed by [[Brooks & Dunn]] in the 1990s.<ref name="allmusic" />

A chronic bout of [[hepatitis C]] forced Naomi into retirement following a 1991 farewell tour. After the duo broke up, Wynonna signed to [[MCA Records]] in association with [[Curb Records]] as a solo artist.

Wynonna reunited with her mother for a 1999 New Year's Eve concert to ring in the year 2000 sponsored by K-mart. They embarked on a full-fledged tour together in 2000, and four new Judds songs were released on an exclusive bonus disc with Wynonna's album, New Day Dawning.

The Judds again reunited in 2010 for "The Last Encore," an 18-city tour. As a result of the tour excitement, Curb Records announced the release of a new album from the Judds, I Will Stand by You: The Essential Collection, which featured two new songs and twelve of the duo's hits. The album was released on April 5, 2011.

On June 1, 2013, the duo celebrated their 30th anniversary.

On January 27, 1992, Wynonna performed solo on television for the first time at the American Music Awards. She unveiled "[[She Is His Only Need]]," the first single from her self-titled solo debut album. This album, ''[[Wynonna (album)|Wynonna]]'', was released in 1992 via MCA/Curb, under the production of [[Tony Brown (record producer)|Tony Brown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrymusic.about.com/od/cdreviewsal/fr/Wynonna.htm |title=Wynonna-Review of Wynonna's first self-titled album |access-date=April 8, 2009 |work=[[About.com]]}}</ref> "She Is His Only Need" went to number one on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' country singles charts that year, as did the album's next three<!-- just two listed --> singles, "[[I Saw the Light (Wynonna Judd song)|I Saw the Light]]" and "My Strongest Weakness". "[[No One Else on Earth]],"<ref name="allmusic" /> was also the number one country song of 1992 according to [[Billboard Year-End]]. "She Is His Only Need" and "No One Else on Earth" were also minor Adult Contemporary hits, and the latter peaked at No.&nbsp;83 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. "[[My Strongest Weakness]]," the album's final single, was a No.&nbsp;4 country hit. The album shipped five million copies in the United States, earning a 5× Multi-Platinum certification from the [[RIAA]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

Her second album, ''[[Tell Me Why (Wynonna Judd album)|Tell Me Why]]'', was released by MCA/Curb in 1993.<ref name="allmusic" /> Also a platinum-selling album, it accounted for five consecutive Top Ten hits on the country charts: the [[Tell Me Why (Wynonna Judd song)|title track]], "Only Love," "Is It Over Yet," "Rock Bottom," and "[[Girls with Guitars]]", which was written by [[Mary Chapin Carpenter]].

Wynonna's fourth and final album for MCA was titled ''[[The Other Side (Wynonna Judd album)|The Other Side]]''. Unlike her previous country pop-oriented albums, this album focused on a more [[blues music|blues]] and rock sound.<ref name="allmusic" /> It was released in 1997 and produced four singles. The album did not sell as well as her first three, however, only earning a gold certification. Its singles were not as successful on the charts, either: although "[[When Love Starts Talkin']]" and "[[Come Some Rainy Day]]" reached No.&nbsp;13 and No.&nbsp;14, respectively, "Always Will" fell short of Top 40 and "Love Like That" became the first single of her career not to chart at all.
