'''Lorna Shore''' is an American <!-- they are not "blackened deathcore"-->[[deathcore]] band from [[Warren County, New Jersey]].<ref>"Lorna Shore announce vocalist, premiere new track". June 11, 2021. Lambgoat magazine. [https://lambgoat.com/news/34256/Lorna-Shore-announce-vocalist-premiere-new-track] </ref> Formed in 2010, the group currently consists of lead guitarist Adam De Micco, drummer Austin Archey, rhythm guitarist Andrew O'Connor, and vocalist Will Ramos. They have released three [[Extended play|EPs]] and released their debut album ''Psalms'' in June 2015 and their second album ''Flesh Coffin'' in February 2017. Their third album ''Immortal'' was released in January 2020. Their most recent EP ''...And I Return To Nothingness'' was released August 13, 2021.

== History ==
===Early releases, ''Psalms'', and ''Flesh Coffin'' (2010–2018)===
The band's first EP entitled ''Triumph'', released in 2010, carried a distinct [[metalcore]] sound, while occasionally bordering on [[deathcore]]. The band's second EP ''Bone Kingdom'' was the first to carry a deathcore sound, albeit a more straightforward sound reminiscent of bands such as [[Chelsea Grin (band)|Chelsea Grin]] and [[Oceano (band)|Oceano]]. The EP’s second track, “Life of Fear”, was used in a [[viral video]] titled “Heavy Metal Cats”, which currently holds over 6 million views on [[YouTube]].

''Maleficium'', the band's third EP, was released in December 2013. It reached number 3 on the [[iTunes]] Metal Chart and was also released as a [[digipak]] CD making it the first non-digital Lorna Shore release. The band distances and disregards themselves from any releases prior to ''Maleficium'' and considers the EP the "rebirth and true starting point of their career." The band to this day still perform songs from the EP, and it's the earliest material that they will still willingly play live.

Lorna Shore followed the release of ''Maleficium'' by opening [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex's]] Die Without Hope Tour featuring [[I Declare War (band)|I Declare War]], [[Betraying the Martyrs]] and [[Here Comes the Kraken]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/carnifex/status/434105405153628160|title=Lorna Shore is now on the DIE WITHOUT HOPE Tour! Fucking heavy! @LornaShore |date=February 13, 2014|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}</ref> Since then, before releasing their debut album they have toured with acts such as [[The Black Dahlia Murder (band)|The Black Dahlia Murder]], [[Archspire]], [[Oceano (band)|Oceano]], [[Fallujah (band)|Fallujah]], [[Fit for an Autopsy]], [[Cattle Decapitation]], [[Dying Fetus]], [[Deicide (band)|Deicide]], [[Upon a Burning Body]], [[The Last Ten Seconds of Life]], [[Chelsea Grin (band)|Chelsea Grin]], and [[Within the Ruins]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalblade.com/us/news/the-black-dahlia-murder-announce-september-shows/|title=The Black Dahlia Murder announce September shows with Lorna Shore - Metal Blade Records|website=Metalblade.ocm|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/upon_a_burning_body_announce_headlining_tour_with_sylar_and_lorna_shore/|title=Upon A Burning Body announce headlining tour with Sylar and Lorna Shore|date=March 17, 2014|website=Altpress.com|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/22565/Within-The-Ruins-Lorna-Shore-tour-dates|title=Within The Ruins, Lorna Shore tour dates|website=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=February 23, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thecirclepit.com/2015/01/oceano-the-last-ten-seconds-of-life-lorna-shore-boris-the-blade-and-martyr-defiled-tour|title=OCEANO, THE LAST TEN SECONDS OF LIFE, LORNA SHORE, BORIS THE BLADE, AND MARTYR DEFILED TOUR &#124; The Circle Pit|website=Thecirclepit.com|accessdate=October 10, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/comments.aspx?id=23973#0|title=Fallujah, Archspire, Lorna Shore tour dates &#124; Comments &#124; Lambgoat|website=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=October 10, 2020}}</ref>

''Psalms'', their debut album was released on June 9 through Density Records. The album was produced by [[Fit for an Autopsy]] guitarist [[Will Putney]] at The Machine Shop.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://highwiredaze.com/lornashorenews5 |title=Lorna Shore announce June 9, 2015 release date for debut full-length ''Psalms'' |author=Ken |date=April 23, 2015 |website=Highwiredaze.com |access-date=April 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428231009/http://highwiredaze.com/lornashorenews5 |archive-date=April 28, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> 

On September 21, 2016, Lorna Shore announced that they had signed with Outerloop Records and would release their sophomore album ''Flesh Coffin'' on February 17, 2017. The album was produced by Carson Slovak and Grant McFarland at Atrium Audio, who are known for working alongside bands such as [[August Burns Red]] and [[Rivers of Nihil]], among others. They released a single entitled “Denounce The Light” on November 17, 2016.

In early 2017, bassist and founding member Gary Herrera announced his departure from the band, citing his lack of desire and passion for the music as his main reasons. ''Flesh Coffin'' would subsequently be the last release to include Herrera as well as vocalist Tom Barber, who were the only founding members left.

===Barber's departure, McCreery allegations and ''Immortal'' (2018–2020)===
Vocalist and founding member Tom Barber confirmed that he had left Lorna Shore in April 2018 to join [[Chelsea Grin]] as their vocalist, replacing Alex Koehler, who departed earlier in the year.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.deadpress.co.uk/80273/news-vocalist-tom-barber-confirms-he-has-left-lorna-shore |title=Archived copy |access-date=April 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428011951/http://www.deadpress.co.uk/80273/news-vocalist-tom-barber-confirms-he-has-left-lorna-shore |archive-date=April 28, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Lorna Shore issued a statement, assuring their fanbase that they would continue without Barber. CJ McCreery of [[Pittsburgh]]-based deathcore band [[Signs of the Swarm]] was subsequently announced as his replacement after being rumored for some time. After McCreery joined Lorna Shore, the band released two singles, titled “This Is Hell” and “Darkest Spawn”. The band joined the [[Summer Slaughter Tour]] supporting [[Cattle Decapitation]], [[Carnifex (band)|Carnifex]], [[The Faceless]], and several others. In early October, Lorna Shore announced their signing with [[Century Media Records]] along with the announcement of their new album, ''[[Immortal (Lorna Shore album)|Immortal]]''. The band supported [[Fit For An Autopsy]] and [[Rivers of Nihil]] that fall.

On December 23, 2019, the band abruptly fired McCreery after a [[Weinstein effect]]-style string of allegations involving alleged sexual abuse occurred in his name.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/latest-news/breakups/lorna-shore-abruptly-part-ways-with-vocalist-cj-mccreery|title=LORNA SHORE Abruptly Part Ways with Vocalist CJ McCreery|website=Metal Injection|date=December 23, 2019|accessdate=December 23, 2019}}</ref>  The allegations began when an ex-lover of McCreery began posting stories and screenshots of [[text message]]s detailing abusive-like behavior that allegedly occurred within a 4-year relationship. Following this some other parties also began to accuse McCreery of similar misconduct.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2019/12/23/lorna-shore-have-fired-vocalist-cj-mccreery-following-abuse-allegations/|title=Lorna Shore Have Fired Vocalist CJ McCreery Following Abuse Allegations|date=December 23, 2019|publisher=[[MetalSucks]]|accessdate=December 24, 2019}}</ref> A week and a half later, the band announced the cancellation of an upcoming tour in [[Asia]] and that their upcoming ''Immortal'' album (which was developed with McCreery on vocals) would be delayed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theprp.com/2020/01/01/news/lorna-shore-cancel-immediate-dates-following-cj-mccreerys-firing/|title=Lorna Shore Cancel Immediate Shows Following CJ McCreery's Firing|website=ThePRP|date=January 2020|accessdate=January 2, 2020}}</ref><ref>[https://metalinjection.net/latest-news/bummer-alert/lorna-shore-cancel-tour-future-of-the-band-in-doubt LORNA SHORE Cancel Tour & Delay Album] Metal Injection]</ref> However, these claims were later retracted as it was revealed some time later that the album would be released on the originally planned date of January 31.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://metalinjection.net/upcoming-releases/lorna-shore-will-release-new-album-with-ex-vocalist-cj-mccreerys-vocals-will-not-break-up|title=LORNA SHORE Will Release New Album With Ex-Vocalist CJ McCreery's Vocals; Band Will Continue With New Vocalist|website=Metal Injection|date=January 8, 2020|accessdate=January 9, 2020}}</ref>

===''...And I Return to Nothingness'' (2021–present)===
Despite the setback caused by McCreery’s situation, Lorna Shore went on to tour Europe in support of ''Immortal'', recruiting vocalist Will Ramos (formerly of Monument of a Memory and A Wake in Providence) as a stand-in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lambgoat.com/news/32789/Lorna-|title=LORNA SHORE's New Vocalist Revealed|website=Lambgoat.com|accessdate=October 10, 2020}}</ref> All further activity was cut short as a result of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].

On June 11, 2021, the band returned with a new song titled "To the Hellfire", and announced Ramos as their new permanent vocalist. They also announced details of their new EP; ''...And I Return to Nothingness''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deadpress.co.uk/news-lorna-shore-announce-and-i-return-to-nothingness-ep/|title = NEWS: Lorna Shore announce '...And I Return to Nothingness' EP!|date = June 11, 2021}}</ref> It is the band’s first EP since their breakthrough 2013 release ''Maleficium''. 

“To the Hellfire” became a viral success for the band, peaking at number 1 on the iTunes metal chart in its first week of release. It was also voted by the readers of [[Revolver Magazine]] as the “Best Song of 2021 So Far” with writer Eli Enis commenting: "The band's debut song with new vocalist Will Ramos is legitimately one of the most over-the-top heavy deathcore songs in recent memory. It's got numerous bone-snapping breakdowns, blast beats for days, a virtuosic guitar solo and vocals from Ramos...".<ref>"FAN POLL: 5 BEST SONGS OF 2021 SO FAR". By ELI ENIS, July 1, 2021. [https://www.revolvermag.com/music/fan-poll-5-best-songs-2021-so-far#5-cannibal-corpse-inhumane-harvest]</ref> It would also go on to overtake “Immortal” as the band’s most streamed song on [[Spotify]] at over 4 million streams.

The EP was released on August 13, 2021 with positive reviews for the title track. Ricky Aarons writing for ''Wall of Sound'' reviewed the EP and title track stating: "The band continue with the epic vehicle of destruction, but change tact slightly, in a way that’s reminiscent of their previous work... The technical detail and speed to the riffs are incredible. Once again Ramos doesn’t skip a detail in every lyric he sounds... He considers which lines end in a high or low and these minute details are make-or-break. Instead of the song focusing on breakdown ferocity it’s more about stead-fast blast beats and the technical element of this wonderful band."<ref>Ricky Aarons.
