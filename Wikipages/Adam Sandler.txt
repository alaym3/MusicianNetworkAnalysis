==Career==
===1987–1995===

Early in his career, in 1987, Sandler played [[Theo Huxtable]]'s friend, Smitty, in ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' and the Stud Boy or Trivia Delinquent in the [[Game show|MTV game show]] ''[[Remote Control (game show)|Remote Control]]''. After his film debut ''[[Going Overboard]]'' in 1989, Sandler performed in comedy clubs, having first taken the stage at his brother's urging when he was 17. He was discovered by comedian [[Dennis Miller]], who caught Sandler's act in Los Angeles and recommended him to ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' producer [[Lorne Michaels]]. Sandler was hired as a writer for ''SNL'' in 1990 and became a featured player the following year, making a name for himself by performing amusing original songs on the show, including "[[The Thanksgiving Song]]" and "[[The Chanukah Song]]".<ref name=biography.com>{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/adam-sandler-9542505|title=Adam Sandler: Film Actor, Singer, Songwriter, Comedian, Screenwriter (1966–)|website=[[Biography.com]]|publisher=[[A&E Networks]]| access-date=March 26, 2019}}</ref> Sandler told [[Conan O'Brien]] on ''[[The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien|The Tonight Show]]'' that [[NBC]] fired him and [[Chris Farley]] from the show in 1995, and played this up in his return to the show as a host in 2019.<ref name="Sandler fired">{{cite news| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2010/01/21/2010-01-21_youre_not_alone_conan_obrien_adam_sandler_says_nbc_fired_him_and_chris_farley_fr.html | title= You're not alone, Conan O'Brien: Adam Sandler says NBC fired him and Chris Farley from 'SNL'| first= Joe |last=Dziemianowicz| work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] | location=New York City |date= January 21, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Adam Sandler's "I Was Fired" Monologue – SNL |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eghK5yMpNuc | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211028/eghK5yMpNuc| archive-date=2021-10-28|publisher=SNL}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1993, Adam Sandler appeared in the film ''[[Coneheads (film)|Coneheads]]'' with Chris Farley, [[David Spade]], [[Dan Aykroyd]], [[Phil Hartman]], and [[Jane Curtin]]. In 1994, he co-starred in ''[[Airheads]]'' with [[Brendan Fraser]] and [[Steve Buscemi]].

===1995–2007===
[[File:Adamsandler(cannesPhotocall).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Sandler at 2002 [[Cannes Film Festival]]]]
Sandler starred in ''[[Billy Madison]]'' (1995) playing a grown man repeating grades 1–12 to earn back his father's respect and the right to inherit his father's multimillion-dollar hotel empire. The film was successful at the box office despite negative reviews. He followed this film with ''[[Bulletproof (1996 film)|Bulletproof]]'' (1996), and the financially successful comedies ''Happy Gilmore'' (1996) and ''The Wedding Singer'' (1998). He was initially cast in the bachelor–party–themed comedy/thriller ''[[Very Bad Things]]'' (1998) but had to back out due to his involvement in ''[[The Waterboy]]'' (1998), one of his first hits.

Sandler formed his film production company, [[Happy Madison Productions]],<ref name="happy">[http://www.adamsandler.com/index.php?section=happy "Happy Madison."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118222008/http://www.adamsandler.com/index.php?section=happy |date=November 18, 2005 }} AdamSandler.com. Accessed October 9, 2008.</ref> in 1999, first producing fellow ''SNL'' alumnus [[Rob Schneider]]'s film ''[[Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo]]''. The company has produced most of Sandler's subsequent films to date, and is located on the Sony/[[Columbia Pictures]] lot in [[Culver City, California]]. The majority of the company's films have received negative reviews from critics, with three considered to be among the [[List of films considered the worst|worst ever made]]<ref>[https://www.metacritic.com/feature/adam-sandler-all-films-considered Adam Sandler: All Films Considered] Metacritic. Accessed April 21, 2015.</ref> yet most have performed well at the box office. Others who frequently appear in Sandler films include [[David Spade]], [[Kevin James]], [[Steve Buscemi]], [[Chris Rock]], [[John Turturro]], [[Peter Dante]], [[Allen Covert]], [[Jonathan Loughran]], and [[Jon Lovitz]].

Although his earliest films did not receive favorable critical attention, he started to receive more positive reviews, beginning with ''Punch-Drunk Love'' in 2002. [[Roger Ebert]]'s review of ''Punch-Drunk Love'' concluded that Sandler had been wasted in earlier films with poorly written scripts and characters with no development.<ref>{{cite news|first=Roger|last=Ebert|author-link=Roger Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20021018/REVIEWS/210180308/1023|title=Punch-Drunk Love|newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|location=Chicago, Illinois|date=October 18, 2002}}</ref>

Sandler has moved outside the genre of slapstick comedy to take on more serious roles, such as the aforementioned ''[[Punch-Drunk Love]]'', for which he was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]], and [[Mike Binder]]'s ''[[Reign Over Me]]'' (2007), a drama about a man who loses his entire family during the [[September 11 attacks]], and then struggles to rekindle a friendship with his old college roommate ([[Don Cheadle]]).

That same year, Sandler starred along with [[Keri Russell]] and English comedian [[Russell Brand]] in [[Adam Shankman]]'s children's fantasy film ''[[Bedtime Stories (film)|Bedtime Stories]]'' (2008), as a stressed hotel maintenance worker whose bedtime stories he reads to his niece and nephew begin to come true.
