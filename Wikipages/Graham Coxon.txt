'''Graham Leslie Coxon''' (born 12 March 1969) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, multi-instrumentalist and painter who came to prominence as a founding member of the rock band [[Blur (band)|Blur]]. As the group's lead guitarist and secondary vocalist, Coxon is featured on all eight of Blur's studio albums (although 2003's ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' only features his playing on one track, due to his temporary departure from the band during recording sessions for the album). He has also led a solo career since 1998. As well as being a musician, Coxon is a visual artist: he designed the [[cover art]] for all his solo albums as well as Blur's ''[[13 (Blur album)|13]]'' (1999).

Coxon plays several instruments and records his albums with little assistance from session musicians. [[Q (magazine)|''Q'']] magazine critic Adrian Deevoy has written: "Coxon is an astonishing musician. His restless playing style – all chord slides, rapid pulloffs, mini-arpeggios and fractured runs – seems to owe more to his saxophone training than any conventional guitar tuition."<ref>{{cite journal|last=Deevoy|first=Adrian|date=March 1996|title=Stop the band, I wanna get off!|journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|publisher=[[Bauer Media Group]]}}</ref> An innovative lead guitarist,<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2007/mar/19/musicnews.music "From Britpop to Britop"].

Retrieved 26 June 2010.</ref>

==Early life==
Coxon was born in [[Rinteln]], [[West Germany]], where his father, Bob Coxon, was stationed as a clarinet player and band leader in the [[British Army]]. As a child, he moved first to [[Spondon]], [[Derby]], [[England]], a period during which he became a fan of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]. He then moved to [[Colchester]], [[Essex]], in South East England, where he grew up and met fellow [[Blur (band)|Blur]] member [[Damon Albarn]] at [[The Stanway School]], then known as Stanway Comprehensive, at the age of 11. He appeared on the popular BBC children's show ''[[Blue Peter]]'' twice.

==Music career==

===Blur ===
{{Main|Blur (band)|Blur discography}}
Coxon studied [[Fine Arts]] at [[Goldsmiths College]], London, for two years, where early on he met bassist [[Alex James (musician)|Alex James]]. In his time there he mixed with upcoming talents such as [[Damien Hirst]], [[Michael Landy]], [[Sam Taylor-Wood]], and [[Abigail Lane]], some of the future leading lights of the [[Young British Artists|Britart]] movement. He quit college due to the increasing success of his band at the time, Seymour, which later changed its name to Blur because the recording company, [[Food Records]], thought Seymour was too 'student-ish'. They presented a list to the band of preferred names which included "The Shining Path" and "Blur". As well as providing all guitars, backing vocals, and occasional drums, Coxon's lo-fi and alternative musical style and tastes influenced the band's less commercial music in the late 1990s. He sang lead vocals on songs including "Red Necks", "You're So Great" from the album ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'', and "[[Coffee & TV]]", as well as a section of the chorus of "[[Tender (song)|Tender]]", the bridge of "[[Lonesome Street]]" and a section of "Thought I Was a Spaceman" on ''[[The Magic Whip]]''.

During the 1995 period of the media-dubbed '[[Battle of Britpop]]', Coxon became increasingly weary and suspicious of the music industry. His behaviour was occasionally awkward, such as refusing to appear in the video for Blur song "[[Country House (song)|Country House]]" unless he could dress as a milkman and take no part in any action with which he felt uncomfortable.

In November 2001 Coxon was admitted to the [[Priory Hospital]] for 28 days to be treated for alcoholism. During this time, Blur began the recording sessions that would produce the material for their next album, ''Think Tank''. In February 2002, Coxon rejoined the band in the studio for the rest of the recording of ''Think Tank'' but after five days was asked by then manager Chris Morrison not to go back into the studio as the other members of the band had reported that the session was not going too well with him present. Coxon took this as a sign and left the band. As he stated in an interview in 2006, "I had a breakthrough, I think my life just became calmer, I gave up drinking. My priorities changed as I had a young daughter. The group didn't want me to record for the ''[[Think Tank (Blur album)|Think Tank]]'' album, so I took it as a sign to leave". His last contribution to Blur was a song called "Battery in Your Leg", the closing song on Blur's 2003 album ''Think Tank'', before leaving the line-up. Damon Albarn later revealed that the song "Sweet Song" was written after he had been looking at a photograph of Coxon.

After [[Damon Albarn]]'s revealing that he and Coxon had rebuilt their relationship, on 9 December 2008, Blur announced that the whole band would reunite for a show at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on 3 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/blur/41538 |title=Watch Blur speak about their comeback gig in video interview |publisher=NME |date=10 December 2008 |access-date=2012-02-24}}</ref> More dates were announced and the band played festival dates at [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]], [[T in the Park]] and [[Oxegen 2009]] as well as headlining shows in Manchester, Newcastle, Wolverhampton, [[Goldsmiths College]] and the [[East Anglian Railway Museum]] in [[Colchester]]. Blur also played one show in [[Lyon]], France.

On 17 April 2010, the band released their first single since 2003, "[[Fool's Day]]", for the [[Record Store Day]] event as a 7" limited to 1000 copies.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/hi/music/newsid_10080000/newsid_10080900/10080905.stm | work=[[BBC News]] | title=Blur announce Fool's Day single | date=14 April 2010 | access-date=26 April 2010}}</ref> The band released the single as a free download on their official website the next day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blur.co.uk/ |title=blur |publisher=blur |access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.themusicmagazine.co.uk/blur-fools-day-becomes-free-download |title=Blur: Fools Day Becomes Free Download &#124; TMM |publisher=Themusicmagazine.co.uk |access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref> More recently Blur announced via the [[NME]] website that they would reunite every so often and record more singles, preferably on 7&nbsp;inch. However, Damon also stated that an album was not on its way as they were all too busy with their own individual projects.

On 19 February 2015, Coxon and the band announced on social media that they would be releasing their eighth studio album on 27 April, titled ''[[The Magic Whip]]'', Blur's first album in 12 years and first in 16 years in their original lineup.<ref>"[https://www.facebook.com/blur/posts/10153603290425744 Blur - Finally, we can confirm that we will be releasing an album,...]".

===Solo work ===
Coxon had already released three solo albums while a member of Blur before his 2002 departure. His first, ''[[The Sky Is Too High]]'' was released on his own [[Transcopic]] label in 1998. This was followed by ''[[The Golden D]]'' in 2000 and ''[[Crow Sit on Blood Tree]]'' in 2001. After going solo full-time, he released ''[[The Kiss of Morning]]'' in 2002. The album was promoted with the single "Escape Song". In 2004, Coxon released his fifth solo album ''[[Happiness in Magazines]]'', produced by ex-Blur and [[The Smiths]] producer [[Stephen Street]]. This proved to be his most successful album to date, and he received the [[NME Award]] for Best Solo Artist in 2005. {{cn|date=November 2021}}

In March 2006 he released his sixth solo album, called ''[[Love Travels at Illegal Speeds]]'', again produced by Stephen Street. It marked Coxon's first album away from his now-defunct indie label 'Transcopic'. The LP was preceded by the singles "[[Standing on My Own Again]]" on 27 February and "[[You & I (Graham Coxon song)|You & I]]". Coxon embarked on a tour of the UK, starting at [[Newcastle University]]. He was also involved in a single supporting the [[England national football team]] at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. The song was a re-working of the [[Sham 69]] hit "[[Hurry Up Harry]]", and was released as "Sham 69 and The Special Assembly" (as well as Coxon and Sham 69, [[Virgin Radio]] DJ [[Christian O'Connell]], who had run a competition on his show to find a band to record a song in support of the team, was involved in the recording of the song). "[[Hurry Up England]]" entered the [[UK Singles Chart]] at No. 10.

In October 2006, Coxon released a double live album ''[[Burnt to Bitz: At the Astoria]]'' immediately after his sold-out [[London Astoria]] show. The album features 27 songs, with at least one song from each of his albums. In July 2007 Coxon released a single with [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], called "[[This Old Town]]". The single peaked at No. 39 in the [[UK Singles Chart]].

Coxon's seventh 15-track studio album titled ''[[The Spinning Top]]'', produced again by Stephen Street,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/69497/graham_coxon|title=Graham Coxon new album produced by Stephen Street|access-date=2009-03-11|date=11 March 2009|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}</ref> was released on 11 May 2009. Coxon stated that the LP, which is primarily acoustic, followed a narrative – the story of a man from birth to death. "The album is mainly an acoustic journey although there is, of course, some explosive electric guitar action," he explained. "There are some guests too! [[Robyn Hitchcock]] supplies some counter-attack guitar, [[Jas Singh (musician)|Jas Singh]] plays [[dilruba]] and jori with his friends [[Gurjit Sembhi]] on [[taus (instrument)|taus]] and [[Jaskase Singh]] on [[esraj]]. [[Danny Thompson]] plays the legendary Victoria, [[Graham Fox (drummer)|Graham Fox]] gives plenty of swing on the drums and [[sizzle cymbal]]s and [[Louis Vause]] tinkles the ivories."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/graham-coxon/43309 |title=Blur's Graham Coxon to release new concept album |publisher=[[NME]] |date=9 March 2009 |access-date=2013-04-09}}</ref> Pre-release response had been positive, with Monday Field of ''Frank Booth Review'' dubbing the album "a staggering artistic achievement, and Coxon's best solo release to date."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frankboothreview.com/2009/04/graham-coxon-spinning-top-2009.html |title=at |publisher=Frankboothreview.com |access-date=2011-04-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090421171824/http://www.frankboothreview.com/2009/04/graham-coxon-spinning-top-2009.html |archive-date=21 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

His eighth solo album ''[[A+E (album)|A+E]]'' was released in April 2012.

Coxon wrote and recorded the score for the 2017 [[Channel 4]] / [[Netflix]] television series ''[[The End of the F***ing World]]''; it was his first original score.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moore|first1=Sam|title=Graham Coxon to release his original soundtrack for 'The End of the F***ing World'|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/graham-coxon-soundtrack-release-the-end-of-the-fucking-world-2220990|access-date=11 February 2018|work=NME|date=17 January 2018}}</ref> The soundtrack was released in January 2018.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gill|first1=Andy|title=Album reviews: Graham Coxon – The End of the F***ing World, Field Music – Open Here, Simple Minds – Walk Between Worlds, and more|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-reviews-the-end-of-the-fucking-world-soundtrack-netflix-graham-coxon-simple-minds-field-music-a8188956.html|access-date=11 February 2018|work=Independent|date=1 February 2018}}</ref> In September of the same year, Coxon embarked on a solo tour in North America that featured some of the songs from his score.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Kreps|first1=Daniels|title=Blur's Graham Coxon Announces Rare North American Acoustic Tour|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/graham-coxon-announces-rare-north-american-acoustic-tour-702586/|access-date=23 December 2018|work=Rolling Stone|date=23 July 2018}}</ref>

In February 2020, Coxon released an album for the fictional band Bloodwitch, to be a part of the soundtrack of the [[Netflix]] series [[I Am Not Okay with This]], featuring singer Tatyana Richaud and his partner Essy Syed in the vocals.

===Transcopic and other contributions===
Coxon's independent label, [[Transcopic Records|Transcopic]], was co-managed with his friend, and then business partner, Jamie Davis. Davis now runs Independent label [[Ark Recordings]]. Coxon illustrated and designed all of his own album art, and collaborated with his friend Nick Craske creating abstract digital work for the release of ''The Spinning Top''; they also filmed two music videos, "Sorrow's Army" and "'In The Morning". Coxon also continued painting a series of personal work, most of which remained unseen until 2004, when he exhibited at the [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]] in London.

Coxon has also been involved in remixing other peoples tracks, including [[Idlewild (band)|Idlewild]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/graham-coxon/4563 |title=Blur Feel 'Rusty' With Idlewild &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=20 September 2000 |access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref> and [[Lowgold]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jpsblog.net/2007/10/18/graham-coxon-remixer/ |title=JP's Blog &#124; Graham Coxon: Remixer? |publisher=Jpsblog.net |access-date=2011-04-23}}</ref> both of which were released as b-sides and the latter remix was later re-released on the bands anthology release [[Keep Music Miserable]].

In September 2006, Coxon revealed a musical soundscape, "english shoes squeek", created especially for "Verheaven" an exhibition at London's [[Riflemaker]] Gallery of the work of artist Julie Verhoeven.

Coxon appeared on [[John McCusker]]'s ''[[Under One Sky (album)|Under One Sky]]'', providing the song "All Has Gone".

In 2009, Coxon was involved in the creation of the [[Pete Doherty]] solo album ''[[Grace/Wastelands]]''. Doherty had entered a period of sobriety, during which he holed up with Coxon to work on his debut solo album, ''Grace/Wasteland'', (released 24 March 2009) a diverse collection of 12 songs that bounce between reggae and Doherty's standard post-punk. Coxon played on all but one track on the album.

Coxon has also produced albums by Mower and Assembly Line People Programme from his Transcopic label.

In 2013, Graham Coxon was involved in a musical project where artists re-recorded the classic [[Beatles]] album ''[[Please Please Me]]''.<ref>BlurBalls [http://www.blurballs.com/2013/02/graham-coxon-covers-beatles-song.html "Graham Coxon covers Beatles Song 2013"], ''[[BlurBalls]]'', London, 13 February 2013. Retrieved on 15 February 2013.</ref> The Blur guitarist recorded the song "[[Baby It's You]]" live as part of a 10-hour recording session hosted by [[BBC Radio 2]] to mark the 50th anniversary of a challenge set by recording company [[EMI]] to The Beatles to record a whole studio album in one session.

==Instruments and equipment==
Coxon has primarily used [[Fender Telecaster]]s throughout his career, particularly a '52 reissue and a customised 1968 model with a [[Gibson]] PAF humbucker in the neck position, the latter was reissued by Fender as the Graham Coxon signature model although with some minor changes. Since the Blur reunion in 2009 he almost exclusively used a vintage [[Fender Telecaster Deluxe|Telecaster Deluxe]]. During the ''[[Leisure (album)|Leisure]]'' era Coxon also used [[Gibson Les Paul]]s and a [[Fender Jaguar]], whilst on some later songs, such as [[No Distance Left to Run]] and [[This Is a Low]], Coxon uses a [[Gibson ES-335]]. He has occasionally used a heavily modified [[Fender Musicmaster]] which can be seen in the [[Coffee & TV]] and [[Beetlebum]] videos. Coxon plays all the instruments featured in his solo work, and has used a variety of guitars, notably [[Gibson SG]]s, and a [[Burns London]] Sonic. He has been recently seen playing a [[Fender Telecaster Custom|Telecaster Custom]].

Graham recently received a custom-made guitar from Gray Guitars; it is a Telecaster-type instrument and features a semi-acoustic body and P90 style pickups.

Coxon's playing makes significant use of effects pedals such as distortion, delay (a significant example being "Essex Dogs") and flange (as heard in the pre-chorus of [[Girls & Boys (Blur song)|Girls & Boys]]). He uses a custom made Mike Hill pedalboard which over the years has included: Akai Headrush E2, Boss BF-2 Flanger, Boss CS-3 Compressor/Sustainer, Boss DD-3 Digital Delay, Boss DM-2 Analogue Delay, Boss OD-3, Boss NS-2 Noise Suppressor, Boss PN-2 Tremolo/Pan, Boss RV-5 Digital Reverb, Boss TR-2 Tremolo, Boss TU-2 Tuner, Boss VB-2 Vibrato, DOD Punkifier, Electro-Harmonix HOG, Electro-Harmonix Holy Grail, Line 6 FM4 Filter Modeller, ProCo RAT, Shin-Ei FY-2 Companion Fuzz, T-Rex Mudhoney Distortion.

For amplification, he uses two [[Marshall 1959]] SLP heads going in to individual 1968 4x12 cabinets.

A detailed gear diagram of Graham Coxon's 1993 Blur guitar rig is well-documented.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.guitargeek.com/graham-coxon-blur-1993-guitar-rig-and-gear-setup-diagram/ |last=Cooper |first=Adam |date=1993 |title=Graham Coxon's 1993 Blur Guitar Rig |publisher=GuitarGeek.Com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023012251/http://www.guitargeek.com/graham-coxon-blur-1993-guitar-rig-and-gear-setup-diagram/|archive-date=2015-10-23 | url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Other artistic endeavours==
Coxon is a visual artist and designs all his album sleeves. He has also designed album sleeves for other artists.

His work also featured on the cover of English folk singer [[Kate Rusby]]'s album ''[[The Girl Who Couldn't Fly]]''.
