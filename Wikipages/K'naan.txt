'''Keinan Abdi Warsame''' ({{lang-so|Keynaan Cabdi Warsame}}, {{lang-ar|كَينَان عَبدِ وَرسَمَ}} ''Kaynān ʿAbdi Warsama''), better known by his stage name '''K'naan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|eɪ|n|ɑː|n}}<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.thecoast.ca/Articles-i-2005-10-13-99147.112113_War_Beats.html | archive-url=https://archive.today/20120526053528/http://www.thecoast.ca/Articles-i-2005-10-13-99147.112113_War_Beats.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=26 May 2012 | newspaper=[[The Coast (newspaper)|The Coast]] | access-date=4 May 2008 | date=13 October 2005 | first=Sue | last=Carter Flinn | title=War & Beats: Somali-born hip-hop artist K'naan wants his music to have purpose. }}</ref>), is a [[Somali Canadians|Somali-Canadian]] poet, rapper, singer, songwriter and instrumentalist. He rose to prominence with the success of his single "[[Wavin' Flag]]", which was chosen as [[Coca-Cola]]'s promotional anthem for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Besides hip hop, K'naan's sound is influenced by elements of [[Music of Somalia|Somali music]] and [[world music]]. He is also involved in various philanthropic initiatives.

==Personal life==
K'naan was born 16 April 1978 in [[Mogadishu]], situated in the southeastern [[Banaadir]] province of [[Somalia]] to a [[Marehan]] [[Darod|Darood]] family.<ref>{{cite tweet|number=959239088112095234|user=KNAAN|title=I’m proud to have 3 bdays, my Somali...|date=2 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/beautiful-dreamer/Content?oid=1148187 |title=Beautiful Dreamer |publisher=Thestranger.com |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> K'naan's family was from an artistic background.

These incidents and the general escalation in violence prompted his mother to seek a visa so that the family could join his father in New York. When he was 13, K'naan and his mother and two siblings, older brother Liban and younger sister Sagal, moved to the United States. They stayed in New York for half a year where K'naan's father settled before relocating to [[Toronto]], Ontario, Canada,<ref name="Tpolm"/> his family still resides there.

In his new environment, K'naan began learning English, partly by listening to hip hop albums by artists like [[Nas]] and [[Rakim]]. Despite the fact that he could not yet speak the language, he taught himself hip-hop and rap diction, copying the lyrics and style [[phonetic]]ally.<ref name="cbc"/> He then also began [[rapping]].<ref name="mp3">{{cite web |url=http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/5720.html |title=MP3.com Live: K'Naan breaks out |first=Welte |last=Jim |date=7 August 2006 |work=Mp3.com |publisher=[[CNET.com]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929104442/http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/5720.html |archive-date=29 September 2007 |access-date=10 June 2010 |quote=With a sound that fuses Bob Marley, conscious American hip-hop, and brilliant protest poetry, the Somali MC was the most promising artist at the 2006 Reggae on the River festival.}}</ref> While growing up in Toronto's [[Rexdale]] neighbourhood, K'naan lost many friends to murder, suicide, prison, and deportation.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/soccer-and-song-k-naan-s-passport-to-global-exposure-1.915498 | access-date = 31 July 2010 | work=CBC News | title=Soccer and song: K'naan's passport to global exposure | date=8 April 2010}}</ref>

==Career==
K'naan became a friend and associate of Canadian promoter Sol Guy, who helped him secure a speaking engagement before the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] in 1999, where K'naan performed a [[spoken word]] piece criticizing the UN for its failed [[UNOSOM I|peacekeeping missions to Somalia]].<ref name="eye">{{cite news| last = Doherty| first = Mike| title = Wandering star| newspaper = [[Eye Weekly]]| date = 10 February 2005| url = http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_02.10.05/beat/knaan.php |access-date = 19 October 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926235909/http://www.eyeweekly.com/eye/issue/issue_02.10.05/beat/knaan.php |archive-date = 26 September 2007}}</ref> One of the audience members, Senegalese singer [[Youssou N'Dour]], was so impressed by the young MC's performance and courage that he invited him to contribute to his 2001 album ''Building Bridges'', a project through which K'naan was able to tour the world.

This project led to his work at other UN events, as well as the [[Montreal Jazz Festival]] and the [[Halifax Pop Explosion]]. It also helped him meet Canadian producer [[Brian West (musician)|Brian West]] and [[Jarvis Church]] and his Track & Field team in 2002, who produced his debut album ''[[The Dusty Foot Philosopher]]'', which was released in 2005 to critical acclaim. In 2006, it won the [[Juno Award for Rap Recording of the Year]], and was nominated for the [[2006 Polaris Music Prize]]. It also won the BBC Radio 3 Award for [[World Music]] in the newcomer category for 2007.<ref name="bbc">{{cite web| last = Lusk| first = John| title = Awards for World Music 2007 – Newcomers| publisher = BBC| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/worldmusic/a4wm2007/2007_knaan.shtml| access-date = 26 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=CBC Arts| title = Canadian musician K'naan captures BBC prize| publisher = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]| date = 31 March 2007| url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/story/2007/03/31/knaan-bbc-award.html| access-date = 26 June 2007}}</ref>  ''The Dusty Foot Philosopher'' was re-released and repackaged as a "Deluxe Edition" featuring new mixes and a bonus DVD in the United States (and various international territories) by the emerging media company and record label iM (Interdependent Media, Inc.) in 2008.

K'naan toured and collaborated with artists like [[Nelly Furtado]], [[Mos Def]], [[will.i.am]], [[The Roots]], [[Dead Prez]], and [[Pharoahe Monch]] on tours such as [[Live 8 concert, Canada|Live 8]]<ref>{{cite magazine| first=Stephanie | last=Joudrey | title = K'naan Looks Back at Africa During Career High | magazine = [[Chart (magazine)|Chart]] | date = 4 July 2005 | url = http://www.chartattack.com/news/39010/knaan-looks-back-at-africa-during-career-high | access-date = 10 August 2009 }}</ref> and Breedlove Odyssey.<ref name="indep"/> He also collaborated with [[Damian Marley]] on the "[[Welcome to Jamrock]]" touring session.<ref>{{cite web| last = Brown| first = Kirk| title = K'naan joins the Mind Control Tour of the U.S. with Stephen Marley and Damian Marley| publisher = Reggae Liftstyle| url = http://www.reggaelifestyle.com/index.php?itemid=56| access-date = 26 June 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927050139/http://www.reggaelifestyle.com/index.php?itemid=56| archive-date = 27 September 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref>

K'naan released ''[[The Dusty Foot on the Road]]'', a collection of recordings made during his world tour on [[Wrasse Records]].<ref>{{cite web| title = K'naan – The Dusty Foot on the Road Album| publisher = [[Wrasse Records]]| year = 2006| url = http://www.wrasserecords.com/K_naan_100/The_Dusty_Foot_On_The_Road_190.html| access-date = 26 June 2007| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070629203202/http://www.wrasserecords.com/K_naan_100/The_Dusty_Foot_On_The_Road_190.html| archive-date = 29 June 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref>

K'naan rose to mainstream popularity by participating in the 2008 BET Awards Cypher. This was his first appearance on American television. His second studio album, ''[[Troubadour (K'naan album)|Troubadour]]'', was released on 24 February 2009 on [[A&M/Octone Records]], and distributed through [[Universal Music Group]] worldwide. The album's first single, "ABC's", was released in late 2008. K'naan's music has featured in several video games such as [[Madden NFL 09]] (with his song "ABC's") and [[FIFA 06]] (with his song "Soobax"). The song "If Rap Gets Jealous", a re-recording of a track of the same name – with different verses – from ''The Dusty Foot Philosopher'', features [[Metallica]] lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]]. K'naan was also the first featured artist on X3, a collaborative project between [[CBC Radio 3]], ''[[Exclaim!]]'' magazine and [[aux.tv]] to promote new Canadian music.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x3artist.com/ |title=X3 Artist of the Month: K'naan |publisher=X3artist.com |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> In July 2010, he performed a cover of [[U2]]'s "[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]" for [[iheartradio]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.covermesongs.com/2010/08/two-new-iheartradio-videos-robyn-strips-down-alicia-keys-k%E2%80%99naan-goofs-around-for-u2.html |title=Two New iheartradio Videos: Robyn Strips Down Alicia Keys, K'naan Goofs Around for U2 " Cover Me |publisher=Covermesongs.com |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> On 24 January 2012, K'naan released a 5-song EP under the title ''[[More Beautiful Than Silence]]'' including songs such as "Nothing to Lose", "Better", "[[Is Anybody Out There]]?". The songs also include collaborations with Nas and Nelly Furtado.

K'naan's 2012 album, ''[[Country, God or the Girl]]'', was met with little of the critical acclaim and success that ''Troubadour'' received. Unlike ''Troubadour'', which was produced almost entirely by production team Track and Field, ''[[Country, God or the Girl]]'' featured a wide range of different producers, many of whom work on more mainstream projects. After the release of the album, K'naan published an article in the [[New York Times]] explaining and apologizing for the change in his sound. "My lyrics should change, my label's executives said; radio programmers avoid subjects too far from fun and self-absorption," recounts K'naan. "So I began to say yes. Yes to trying out songs with A-list producers. Yes to moving production from Kingston to Los Angeles." In the end, K'naan states "I had not made my Marley or my Dylan, or even my K'naan; I had made an album in which a few genuine songs are all but drowned out by the loud siren of ambition. Fatima had become Mary, and Mohamed, Adam."<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/opinion/sunday/knaan-on-censoring-himself-for-success.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title=K'naan, on Censoring Himself For Success | date=8 December 2012}}</ref>

In 2012, K'naan published a children's book, ''When I Get Older: The Story Behind Wavin' Flag''.<ref>[[Greg Quill]], [https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/books/2012/09/27/the_story_behind_knaans_wavin_flag.html "The story behind K’naan’s “Wavin’ Flag”"]. ''[[Toronto Star]]'', 27 September 2012.</ref>

He is featured along with Howard Shore in the ''[[Cosmopolis (film)|Cosmopolis (2012)]]'' soundtrack.

==Political involvement==
K’Naan has remained committed to his Somali roots and continues to be outspoken in the geopolitics of his home country. He is often regarded as a spokesperson for the Toronto Somali community. In 2007, he was invited by Canadian Broadcast Corporation to reflect on changes in the Somali courts, including the removal of the Islamic Courts Union.<ref>[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/k-naan-s-immigrant-experience-series-mogadishu-minnesota-draws-mixed-reaction-from-somalis-1.3831720 Article by the CBC]</ref> K’Naan renounced this act by Somalia and indicated his support for the Islamic Courts Union, pushing back on the Western critiques of Muslim governing systems. Furthermore, he has spoken out against the clan system used in Somalia and particularly its use in immigrant communities in Canada.<ref>Robin, Denselow, [https://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/may/25/worldmusic.urban "A Brave man Doesn't Need Weapons], ''The Guardian'', 05/25/2007</ref>

K’Naan's engagement with his Somali roots dates back to his first hit “Soobax,” which in his native Somali language means “come out.” The song critiques the warlords that held power in Somalia's capital, Mogadishu.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://genius.com/Knaan-soobax-lyrics|title=K'naan – Soobax|website=Genius.com|access-date=2020-03-20}}</ref> The song gained popularity in Somalia, Canada and the United States. Additionally, K’Naan goes beyond reflecting on his Somali roots in his lyrics as he often raps in both English and Somali rather than one language. His choice to blend both languages has made him a standout among hip hop artists.

K’Naan's involvement in rap and hip hop in North America has expanded the discussion on both Somali and the Black Diaspora in the West. Both his music and appearances on television and radio shows have grown the conversation on what it means to be Black in Canada. In addition to Black communities that have been residing in the country for over a century there are large Black immigrant communities from the Caribbean and Africa.

Rather than speaking for a larger Black diaspora, K’Naan speaks on his own personal experience including being Somali in Canada.<ref>[Campbell, Mark. "Other/ed" Kinds of Blackness: An Afrodiasporic Versioning of Black Canada. Southern Journal of Canadian Studies. 2012]</ref> K’Naan continues to be a voice of the Toronto Somali communities.

K’naan's cover of the Bob Dylan song "[[With God on Our Side (song)|With God on Our Side]]" is the closing song on Michael Moore's movie ''[[Fahrenheit 11/9]]''.

==Style and influences==
Jim Welte has said K'naan has "a sound that fuses Bob Marley, conscious American hip-hop, and brilliant protest poetry."<ref name="mp3"/> His voice and style has been compared to [[Eminem]],<ref name="cbc"/> but his subject matter is very different; according to K'naan, he makes "urgent music with a message", talking about the situation in his homeland of Somalia and calling for an end to violence and bloodshed.<ref>{{cite web| last = Setterington| first = Joanne| title = K'NAAN – If Rap Gets Jealous| publisher = [[South by Southwest]]| date = 17 March 2007| url = http://2007.sxsw.com/music/showcases/band/41355.html| access-date = 26 June 2007| url-status = dead| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070515221253/http://2007.sxsw.com/music/showcases/band/41355.html| archive-date = 15 May 2007| df = dmy-all}}</ref> He specifically tries to avoid [[gangsta rap]] clichés and posturing,<ref>{{cite magazine| last = Colle| first = Liam| title = NOW HEAR THIS!: K'naan | magazine = [[PopMatters]]| date = 3 November 2005| url = http://www.popmatters.com/music/nowhearthis/knaan-051103.shtml| access-date = 26 June 2007 }}</ref> saying:

K'naan's single "Fatima" is about his childhood friend who was killed in the [[Somali Civil War|Somali civil war]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl6aYKc9EPU|title=K'naan on the meaning of his song "Fatima"|date=2011-08-08|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref>

==Notable live performances==
Prior to the release of ''Troubadour'', K'naan performed with a small acoustic band, consisting of Rayzak (back-up vocals), Kierscey Rand (acoustic guitar) and UDOGG-The Funky Drummer (djembe and drums).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FreJXZ508k0 |title=K'naan – Hoobaale |publisher=YouTube |date=16 October 2008 |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> This style was an essential element of what set K'naan apart from most hip-hop acts. More than that, it reflected K'naan's value of meaningful lyrics over shallow theatrics. One of the last performances of this band was on 16 March 2009 when K'naan rendered four songs from the newly launched album for CBC's program ''[[Q (radio show)|Q]]'' with [[Jian Ghomeshi]], although Rayzak continued to join his subsequent shows and Kierscey Rand made occasional appearances, such as his World Cup Trophy Tour.

Since ''Troubadour'', K'naan has toured almost exclusively with a larger electric ensemble – consisting of drums, bass, electric guitar, and keyboards<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0y49rf2LdXE |title=K'Naan – If Rap Gets Jealous (Live in Vancouver) |publisher=YouTube |date=11 March 2009 |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> – and his performances now also feature elaborate lighting. This change in showmanship, along with his collaborations with such high-profile artists as [[Adam Levine]] and [[Mos Def]], has helped to shift K'naan more into the mainstream flow of the music industry and has helped him gain exposure to a wider audience.

===2010 FIFA World Cup tour===
A remixed version of K'naan's single, "[[Wavin' Flag]]," was chosen as [[Coca-Cola]]'s anthem for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. It was also used in the commercials for the pre-game, which was held in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.ca.msn.com/entertainment/article.aspx?cp-documentid=23360320|title=Toronto hip-hop artist K'naan says World Cup anthem is a 'huge thing'|publisher=[[cp.org]]|date=29 January 2010|access-date=30 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822213251/http://news.ca.msn.com/entertainment/article.aspx?cp-documentid=23360320|archive-date=22 August 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> Additionally, the track is in the soundtrack for the official [[EA Sports]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa (video game)|2010 FIFA World Cup video game]]. In December 2009, K'naan performed the song live during the sponsor's FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour, which took him to 86 countries around the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/content_display/industry/e3ife9d9d88fcefbcdce6fc9bb98de68870 |title=K'Naan Celebrates His World Cup Anthem |publisher=Billboard.biz |access-date=2011-02-21}}</ref> His performance of "Wavin' Flag" was featured in the Top 10 hits in 11 different countries across the world. This also included number one hits in Mexico, Austria, China, Germany, Luxembourg, and Switzerland. In order to appeal to different people around the world, K'naan also recorded the song with various local artists such as David Bisbal, Jacky Cheung, Jane Zhang, [[Nancy Ajram]], and [[Tattoo Colour]].

==Musical feud==
In 2005, the Canadian music scene featured a low-key feud between K'naan and [[k-os]], one of the most prominent Canadian hip-hop artists. Following the release of the music video for the song "Soobax", which was shot by K'naan and a film crew in [[Kenya]], k-os released a track "B-Boy Stance" attacking K'naan: "They took cameras to Africa for pictures to rhyme / Over; Oh, yes, the great pretenders [...] Religious entertainers who want to be life savers."  Though the feud never became high-profile, with K'naan expressing confusion at the attack and respect for k-os, he nonetheless responded with the mixtape track "Revolutionary Avocado" which argued "You the all-knowing with a beer bottle / Wishing you was [[Plato]] and me [[Aristotle]]? / ...Suburban negro turned hip-hop hero / Is there a reason he really hates me, though?" – a rebuttal [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]'s Matthew McKinnon called "cold-cocking the champ".<ref name="cbc">{{cite news| last = McKinnon | first = Matthew | title = Kicking Up Dust| publisher = CBC| date = 30 June 2005| url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/music/knaan.html| access-date = 26 June 2007 }}</ref>
