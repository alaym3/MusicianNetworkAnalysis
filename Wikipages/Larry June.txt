==Early life==
Larry Eugene Hendricks III is originally from San Francisco's [[Hunters Point, San Francisco|Black Hunters Point]] neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sfweekly.com/music/rapper-larry-junes-new-ep-reflects-his-san-francisco-origins/|title=Rapper Larry June's New EP Reflects His San Francisco Origins|date=July 14, 2016|newspaper=[[SF Weekly]]|accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> He was born to teenage parents.<ref name="Organic" /> At age four, he moved to [[Atlanta, Georgia]], where he stayed until the age of 16. After middle school, Larry returned to the Bay Area and attended high school at [[Jesse Bethel High School]] in [[Vallejo, California]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://myspace.com/article/2016/10/18/larry-june-10-things|title=10 Things You Should Know About Larry June|website=Myspace.com|accessdate=29 April 2020}}</ref> His father dabbled in rap, which influenced June. He would distribute[[Compact disc|CD]]'s with his music to schools in his area, and found a breakthrough after selling his music to [[Rasputin Music]] store in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. June later dropped out of high school to focus on making music.<ref name="Organic" />

==Career==
In 2014, ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'' posted June's mixtape ''Route 80'' with [[TM88]]. Following the exposure in ''Complex'', he was signed to [[Warner Records]], with the label giving him a $20,000 advance in exchange for two [[extended plays]] with the option for more records.<ref name="Organic" /> According to June, Warner failed to show interest in his work, which led him to stop recording music for two years. He instead toured the US, opening for [[Post Malone]] and [[Smokepurpp]].<ref name="Organic" /> June released numerous tracks in 2016, including the full-length mixtape ''Sock It to Me''.<ref name="HHDX">{{cite news|last=Garrett|first=Ural|title=Larry June Is Developing His Music Career & Own Brand of Oranges|url=http://hiphopdx.com/news/id.40219/title.larry-june-is-developing-his-music-career-own-brand-of-oranges|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=HipHopDX|date=30 August 2016}}</ref> Warner eventually released him, and he created an account with [[DistroKid]], releasing the projects ''You're Doing Good'', ''Sock it to Me, Pt. 2'' and ''Very Peaceful''.<ref name="Organic" /> As an independent artist, he made more profit from his music streams.<ref name="Organic" /> He also released the EPs ''Larry'' and ''Orange Season'', both of which were produced by [[Cookin' Soul]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Bansky|title=Larry June Mixes Soul With Bay Area Pimpin' For His New 'Orange Season' EP|url=http://uproxx.com/smokingsection/larry-june-orange-season-new-mixtape-stream/|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=Uproxx|date=5 August 2016}}</ref> The release of ''Orange Season'' was accompanied by an iOS game of the same name, inspired by Nintendo's early era 8-bit graphics.<ref name="HHDX"/> He also toured with Cousin Stizz in 2016 and was featured on Stizz's song ''Down Like That'' as well as Malone's single ''Never Understand''.<ref name="Billboard"/><ref name="MusicTimes"/> Additional collaborations in 2016 include rapping with [[Asher Roth]] and Michael Christmas on the track "Laundry".<ref>{{cite news|last=Madden|first=Sidney|title=Asher Roth, Michael Christmas and Larry June Get Fresh Like "Laundry"|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/rap-music/new-music/2016/06/asher-roth-michael-christmas-larry-june-laundry/|accessdate=15 November 2016|work=XXL Mag|date=3 June 2016}}</ref>

In 2020, during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], he recorded at his home studio, releasing six projects, including ''Adjust to the Game'', ''Cruise USA'', ''Numbers'', and ''Keep Going''.<ref name="Organic" /> In early 2021, June launched the Honeybear Boba in San Francisco.<ref name="Organic" />

On June 11, 2021, June released ''Orange Print'', a project that "displays every bit of his persona".<ref name="Organic" /> The release marked his first to be distributed through [[Empire Distribution]], after he stopped releasing independently thought DistroKid.<ref name="Organic" /> Speaking to [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] in May 2021, June said he would consider a major-label record deal if the opportunity comes, but is not rushed about it.<ref name="Organic" />

==Artistry==
Logan Murdock of [[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer ]] wrote about June's craft: "If [[E-40]] is rap's model of independence, June is hip-hop's [[Jack LaLanne]], and he's primed to transform [[Bay Area]] rap. He has a mouthpiece like [[Mac Dre]] and the soul of [[RBL Posse]], with a mission to make it on his terms, even if celebrity doesn't necessarily follow.<ref name="Organic" /> June is known to rap about "passive income", and has said he does not consider his music to portray him as a "lifetime coach", but instead wants to help those from the streets who are trying to make a healthy income.<ref name="Organic" /> Among his most used [[ad-libs]] are "Yee-hee", inspired by [[Michael Jackson]], and "Good job, Larry", stemming from his ascent in the industry.<ref name="Organic" />

===Orange branding===
Outside his career as a musician, June plans on releasing his own brand of oranges based on a suggestion from a friend whose family owns a farm.<ref name="HHDX"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/arts/good-job-larry-2019-was-year-orange|title=Good job, Larry: 2019 was the Year of the Orange|last=Writer|first=Jim Wilson Daily Arts|website=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> On his social media promotions, June ends his sentences with an orange.<ref name="Organic" />
