===2020–present: Upcoming third studio album and new projects===
In wake of the coronavirus, the band produced a 'House Party' event fortnightly in place of the live shows which they would've performed if the pandemic hadn't happened. Clean Bandit produced six of these house parties in total, from April to July, many featuring vocals from their singer Yasmin Green. {{cn|date=October 2020}}

In early August 2020, as their live home music performances gained credit, the band agreed with Global Citizen to host a 12-hour long 'Houseparty Against Hunger' on 8 August, to raise money for the charity to help fight poverty-related hunger. The event consisted of one hour-long sets from DJs around the world.
