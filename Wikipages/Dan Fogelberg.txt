He is known for his 1980s songs, including "[[Longer]]" (1979), "[[Same Old Lang Syne]]" (1980), and "[[Leader of the Band]]" (1982).

==Early life and family==
Dan Fogelberg was born in [[Peoria, Illinois]]. He was the youngest of three sons born to Margaret (née Irvine), a classically trained pianist, and Lawrence Peter Fogelberg, a band director at [[Woodruff High School (Peoria, Illinois)|Woodruff High School]] in Peoria, at [[Pekin Community High School (Illinois)|Pekin Community High School]] in Pekin,<ref name= Treehouse>{{Cite web  |url= http://www.treehouse.org/fogelberg/biography.html  |title= Biography |website= Treehouse.org  |publisher = Wynn Drumm |location= Waxahachie, Texas |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180718001530/http://www.treehouse.org/fogelberg/biography.html  |archive-date = 2018-07-18  |access-date= 2020-07-28 <!-- was June 6, 2010 --> }}</ref> and at [[Bradley University]] in Peoria.<ref name= songfacts>{{cite web|title= Leader Of The Band by Dan Fogelberg |website= SongFacts.com |url= https://www.songfacts.com/facts/dan-fogelberg/leader-of-the-band|access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref> Dan's mother was a Scottish immigrant, and his father was of [[Sweden|Swedish]] descent.<ref name="ref1">{{cite news |last= Lyons|first=Dee |title= Dan Fogelberg: Singer to Shine at Starfest |work= The Dallas Morning News|date=June 26, 1987| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3CF439607F165&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|access-date=December 19, 2007}}</ref> His father would later be the inspiration for the song "[[Leader of the Band]]". Dan often related his memory of his father allowing him to "conduct" the Bradley University school band when he was only four years old.<ref name= songfacts />

Using a [[Mel Bay]] course book, Dan taught himself to play a Hawaiian [[slide guitar]] that his grandfather had given him. He also learned to play the piano. At age 14, he joined a band, The Clan, which covered [[The Beatles]]. His second band was another [[cover band]], The Coachmen, who, in 1967, released a single with both tracks written by Fogelberg, recorded at Golden Voice Recording studio in South Pekin, Illinois, and released on the Ledger Record label: "Maybe Time Will Let Me Forget" and "Don't Want to Lose Her".<ref name= Treehouse /><ref name="RPM">{{cite web| url= https://www.danfogelberg.com/early-rpms |title=Early Recordings| first= |last= |website= danfogelberg.com| publisher=| date= |access-date= August 13, 2021}}</ref>

After graduating from Woodruff High School in 1969, Fogelberg studied theater arts and painting at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] while playing local venues with a folk-rock band, The Ship. He began performing as a solo acoustic player in area cafes. One of these included the Red Herring, which is where he made his first solo recordings as part of a folk festival in 1971.<ref name="RPM" /> He was discovered by [[Irving Azoff]], who started his music management career promoting another Champaign-Urbana act, [[REO Speedwagon]]. Azoff sent him to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], to hone his skills. There he became a [[session musician]] and recorded his first album with producer [[Norbert Putnam]]. In 1972, Fogelberg released his debut album ''[[Home Free (Dan Fogelberg album)|Home Free]]'' to lukewarm response, although it eventually reached platinum status.<ref name="DanFogelbergCom">{{cite web|title=Discography – Home Free|url=http://www.danfogelberg.com/infohomefree.html|website= danfogelberg.com |access-date=February 8, 2016}}</ref>

He performed as an opening act for [[Van Morrison]] in the early 1970s.<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG">{{cite web|title= Dan Fogelberg |url= http://www.mtv.com/news/500252/dan-fogelberg/ |website= [[MTV]].com |access-date=January 10, 2018}}</ref>

==Musical career==
Fogelberg's second effort was successful – the 1974 [[Joe Walsh]]-produced album ''[[Souvenirs (Dan Fogelberg album)|Souvenirs]]''. The song "Part of the Plan" became his first hit. Fogelberg also received contributions from the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] throughout the album. He had toured with the Eagles during this time. After ''Souvenirs'', he released a string of [[RIAA certification|gold]] and platinum albums, including ''[[Captured Angel]]'', recorded at Golden Voice Recording Studio, South Pekin IL<ref>Album documentation</ref> (1975) and ''[[Nether Lands]]'' (1977).

His 1978 ''[[Twin Sons of Different Mothers]]'' was the first of two collaborations with [[jazz]] flautist [[Tim Weisberg]], which found commercial success with songs such as "The Power of Gold".<ref>{{YouTube|_8RPLbfY9&nbsp;km|''The Power of Gold'' video used in the ABC 1980 Olympics}}</ref>  ''Power of Gold'' peaked at number 59 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] – his sole entry on that chart.<ref name="British Hit Singles & Albums">{{cite book

''[[Phoenix (Dan Fogelberg album)|Phoenix]]'', from 1979, reached the top 10, with "[[Longer]]" becoming a #2 pop hit in 1980. This LP eventually sold two million copies.<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG"/>  It was followed by a Top 20 hit "Heart Hotels".

In 1980, Fogelberg appeared on the soundtrack to the film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081696/soundtrack|title=Urban Cowboy (1980) |website=IMDb.com|access-date=8 September 2019}}</ref> with his song "Times Like These" and first performed on a live television program.<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG"/>

''[[The Innocent Age]]'', released in October 1981, was Fogelberg's critical and commercial peak. The double album included four of his biggest hits:  "[[Same Old Lang Syne]]", "[[Hard to Say]]", "[[Leader of the Band]]", and "[[Run for the Roses (song)|Run for the Roses]]".  He drew inspiration for ''The Innocent Age'' from [[Thomas Wolfe]]'s novel ''[[Of Time and the River]]''.  A 1982 [[Greatest Hits (Dan Fogelberg album)|greatest hits album]] contained two new songs, both of which were released as singles: "Missing You" and "[[Make Love Stay]]."  In 1984, he released the album ''[[Windows and Walls]]'', containing the singles "The Language of Love" and "[[Believe in Me (Dan Fogelberg song)|Believe in Me]]."

According to [[MTV]], "Fogelberg couldn't capitalize fully on his popularity, due to stage-fright that caused him to cancel live appearances, including a Dodgers Stadium gig with Elton John." This specious claim was later refuted by Fogelberg himself, citing recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis as the cause of his cancellations, and a dramatic improvement in his health after a tonsillectomy.<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG"/>

Fogelberg released ''[[High Country Snows]]'' in 1985.  Recorded in Nashville, it showcased his and some of the industry's best talent in [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. [[Vince Gill]], [[Ricky Skaggs]], [[Doc Watson]], [[Jerry Douglas]], [[David Grisman]], [[Chris Hillman]], and [[Herb Pedersen]] contributed to the record. In a world he defined as "life in the fast lane", Fogelberg described the music as "life in the off-ramp". In late 1985, he switched gears and took to the road with a group of musician friends, including [[Joe Vitale (musician)|Joe Vitale]], Paul Harris, Tino Gonzales, Jeff Grossberg and Rick Rosas, playing blues in small clubs throughout [[Colorado]] as Frankie and the Aliens, covering songs by [[Cream (band)|Cream]] and [[Muddy Waters]], among others.<ref>{{Cite web

''[[The Wild Places (Dan Fogelberg album)|The Wild Places]]'', an album whose theme was the preservation of nature, was released in 1990 followed by a tour.  His live ''Greetings From The West'' album, and full-length concert film (with interview segments) of the same name, was released in 1991.

''[[River of Souls]]'', released in 1993, was Fogelberg's last studio album for [[Sony Records]].  In 1997, the box set ''Portrait'' encompassed his career with four discs, each highlighting a different facet of his music: "Ballads", "Rock and Roll", "Tales and Travels", and "Hits".<ref name="DAN FOGELBERG"/> In 1999, he released a [[Christmas album]], ''The First Christmas Morning'', and in 2003, ''Full Circle'' showcased a return to the folk-influenced 1970s [[soft rock]] style of music.

In May 2017, a live album of Fogelberg's performance at Carnegie Hall, championed by his family and longtime friend Irv Azoff, sourced from a 1979 tape made by his touring sound company, was released. It peaked at No. 71 on the ''Billboard'' album chart on June 10, 2017,<ref>{{Cite magazine|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/dan-fogelberg|title=Dan Fogelberg Live At Carnegie Hall Chart History|magazine=Billboard}}</ref> becoming the first of Fogelberg's live albums to chart on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 chart.

Fogelberg was married three times: to Maggie Slaymaker from 1982 to 1985, to Anastasia Savage, from 1991 to 1996; and to musician Jean Marie Mayer, from 2002, until his death in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web

== Legacy ==
In tribute to Fogelberg, [[Peoria, Illinois|Peoria]] renamed Abington Street in the city's East Bluff neighborhood "Fogelberg Parkway".

Garth Brooks has been vocal about the effect that Fogelberg and his work had on his music. "There are songs that people say are the soundtrack of your life....In college, I would take out my Dan Fogelberg records, and would read a passage (of lyrics) from Fogelberg's work, and go about my day. That was an artist who changed my life, who made me change where I wanted to go and the music I wanted to play, and thus, led me here."<ref>{{cite web |work= [[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |first= Piet |last= Levy|via= jsonline.com |title=Nine highlights from Garth Brooks, Trisha Yearwood press conference |date= September 25, 2015 |url= http://archive.jsonline.com/entertainment/musicandnightlife/nine-highlights-from-garth-brooks-tricia-yearwood-press-conference-b99584484z1-329596741.html/ |access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref>
