However, the group's subsequent follow-ups failed to chart, as did their debut album ''Back Up Train''. While performing with the Soul Mates, Green came into contact with [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] record producer [[Willie Mitchell (musician)|Willie Mitchell]], who hired him in 1969 to be a vocalist for a Texas show with Mitchell's band. Following the performance, Mitchell asked Green to sign with his [[Hi Records]] label.<ref name="LarkinSM"/>

==Career==
===Early success===
Having noted that Green had been trying to sing like [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Sam Cooke]], [[Wilson Pickett]], and [[James Brown]], Mitchell became his vocal mentor, coaching him into finding his own voice. Before releasing his first album with Hi, Green removed the final "e" from his name. Subsequently, he released ''[[Green Is Blues]]'' (1969), which was a moderate success. His follow-up album, ''[[Al Green Gets Next to You]]'' (1971), featured the hit R&B cover of the [[The Temptations|Temptations]]' "[[I Can't Get Next to You]]", recorded in a slow [[blues music|blues]]-oriented version.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The album also featured his first significant hit, "[[Tired of Being Alone]]",<ref name="LarkinSM"/> which sold a million copies and was certified gold, becoming the first of eight gold singles Green would release between 1971 and 1974.<ref name=":9">{{Cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/gold-platinum/|title=Al Green – Gold & Platinum|website=RIAA|language=en-US}}</ref>
[[File:Al Green 1973.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Green in an appearance on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]'' in 1973]] 
Green's next album, ''[[Let's Stay Together (Al Green album)|Let's Stay Together]]'' (January 1972), solidified his place in soul music.<ref name="LarkinSM"/> The [[Let's Stay Together (Al Green song)|title track]] was his biggest hit to date, reaching number one on both the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|R&B]] charts.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/artist/al-green/chart-history/bsi/|title=Al Green Chart History|website=Billboard}}</ref> The album became his first to be certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]]. His follow-up, ''[[I'm Still in Love with You (Al Green album)|I'm Still in Love with You]]'' (October 1972) went platinum with the help of the singles "[[Look What You Done for Me]]" and the [[I'm Still in Love with You (Al Green song)|title track]], both of which went to the top ten on the Hot 100. His next album, ''[[Call Me (Al Green album)|Call Me]]'' (April 1973) produced three top ten singles: "[[You Ought to Be with Me]]", "[[Call Me (Come Back Home)]]", and "[[Here I Am (Come and Take Me)]]".<ref name=":6" />  In addition to these hit singles, Green also had radio hits with songs such as "[[Love and Happiness]]", his cover of the [[Bee Gees]]' "[[How Can You Mend a Broken Heart]]", "[[Simply Beautiful]]", "What a Wonderful Thing Love Is", and "[[Take Me to the River]]", later covered successfully by [[New wave music|new wave]] band [[Talking Heads]] and blues artist [[Syl Johnson]].

Green's album ''[[Livin' for You]]'' (December 1973) was certified gold.<ref name=":9" /> He continued to record successful R&B hits in the next several years including "[[Livin' for You (song)|Livin' for You]]", "Sha-La-La (Makes Me Happy)" from his album ''[[Al Green Explores Your Mind]],'' "Let's Get Married", "[[L-O-V-E (Love)]]" and "[[Full of Fire (song)|Full of Fire]]".

By the time Green released the album, ''[[The Belle Album]]'' in 1977, however, Green's record sales had plummeted, partially due to Green's own personal issues during this time and his desire to become a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Strong|first=Martin C. |author2=Peel, John|title=The Great Rock Discography: Complete Discographies Listing Every Track Recorded by More Than 1,200 Artists|publisher=Canongate U.S.| year= 2004| page =628| isbn= 1-84195-615-5}}</ref> His last Hi Records album, ''[[Truth n' Time]]'', was released in 1978 and failed to become a success.

=== Gospel recordings ===
Continuing to record R&B, Green saw his sales start to slip and drew mixed reviews from critics. In 1979, he injured himself falling off the stage while performing in Cincinnati and took this as a message from God. He then concentrated his energies towards pastoring his church and [[gospel music]].<ref name=":5">{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2773|title=Al Green (1946–)|website=encyclopediaofarkansas.net|access-date=August 7, 2008}}</ref>

From 1981 to 1989 Green recorded a series of gospel albums.<ref name=":5" /> While still under contract with Hi Records, Green released the 1980 album, ''[[The Lord Will Make a Way]]'', his first of six albums on the [[Christianity|Christian]] label [[Myrrh Records]].<ref name=":7" /> The title song from the album would later win Green his first of eight [[Grammy Award]]s in the Best Soul Gospel Performance category.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/al-green|title=Al Green|website=Recording Academy Grammy Awards|date=November 23, 2020}}</ref> In 1982, Green co-starred with [[Patti LaBelle]] in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play, "[[Your Arms Too Short to Box with God]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=4182|title=''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God'': A Soaring Celebration in Song and Dance|website=IBDb.com|access-date=August 7, 2008}}</ref>  In 1984, director [[Robert Mugge]] released a documentary film, ''Gospel According to Al Green'', including interviews about his life and footage from his church. In 1985, he reunited with Willie Mitchell along with [[Angelo Earl]] for ''[[He Is the Light]]'', his first album for A&M Records. His 1987 follow-up, ''[[Soul Survivor (Al Green album)|Soul Survivor]]'', featured the minor hit, "Everything's Gonna Be Alright", which reached number 22 on the ''Billboard'' R&B chart, his first top 40 R&B hit since "I Feel Good" in 1978.<ref name=":6" />

=== Return to secular music ===
Green returned to secular music in 1988 recording "[[Put a Little Love in Your Heart]]" with [[Annie Lennox]].<ref name="LarkinSM"/> Featured on the soundtrack to the movie, ''[[Scrooged]]'', the song became Green's first top 10 pop hit since 1974. Green had a hit in 1989 with "The Message is Love" with producer [[Arthur Baker (musician)|Arthur Baker]]. Two years later, he recorded the theme song to the short-lived show ''[[Good Sports]]''.<ref>{{cite news | title = Good Sports | work = Entertainment Weekly | author = Tucker, Ken | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,313123,00.html | date=January 25, 1991}}</ref> In 1993, he signed with [[RCA Records|RCA]] and with Baker again as producer, released the album, ''Don't Look Back''. Green received his ninth Grammy award for his collaboration with [[Lyle Lovett]] for their duet of "[[Funny How Time Slips Away]]". Green's 1995 album, ''[[Your Heart's In Good Hands]]'', was released around the time that Green was inducted to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].<ref name=thinice>{{cite book|last=Van Til|first=Reinder |author2=Olson, Gordon|title=Thin Ice: Coming of Age in Grand Rapids|publisher=Wm.

=== Assault charges ===
Green's former secretary, Linda Wills, filed a $25,000 civil suit against him in 1974.

In 1977, Green and his former organ player Larry Robinson were arrested for assault on [[Memorial Day]] in [[Irving, Texas]]. According to Robinson, Green and his bodyguards jumped him when he confronted Green about owed money from previous gigs.

In 1978, Green was charged with assault and battery for allegedly beating Lovie Smith unconscious with a tree limb. The charges were dismissed after Smith, who had moved, did not receive a [[subpoena]] and therefore missed the court date.<ref>{{Cite magazine|date=September 6, 1979|title=Al Green Cleared of Memphis Battery Charges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vkIDAAAAMBAJ&q=al+green+lovie+smith&pg=PA64|magazine=Jet|volume= 56| issue =  25|pages=64}}</ref>
