In 1978, Crawford sang vocals on "Hoping Love Will Last", the opening song on side two of ''[[Please Don't Touch!]]'', which was the second solo album by the former [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] guitarist [[Steve Hackett]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Collins|first1=Phil|last2=Banks|first2=Tony|last3=Gabriel|first3=Peter |author4=Mike Rutheford |author5=Steve Hackett|title=Genesis: Chapter and Verse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BCpUT3K-DzcC&pg=RA1-PA186|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0312379568|page=186}}</ref>

Her follow-up [[solo (music)|solo]] efforts included "[[One Day I'll Fly Away]]" (1980) and "[[You Might Need Somebody]]" (1981), which became soul standards, and a cover of the [[Tony Joe White]] song, popularised by [[Brook Benton]], "[[Rainy Night in Georgia]]". The album, ''[[Secret Combination (Randy Crawford album)|Secret Combination]]'' (1981) stayed on the [[UK Albums Chart]] for sixty weeks, after which her profile dipped, despite a return to the UK [[Top 40|Top Ten]] with "[[Almaz (song)|Almaz]]" in 1986.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> In June 1981, Crawford also released another hit, "One Hello", from the album ''Windsong''.

''Naked And True'' (1995) brought Crawford back to her roots: it included [[George Benson]]'s "[[Give Me the Night (George Benson song)|Give Me the Night]]", and confirmed her soul heritage by featuring [[Funkadelic]] members [[Bootsy Collins]], [[Bernie Worrell]] and the [[Fred Wesley]] Horns.<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/> She enjoyed her highest profile of the decade when rising starlet [[Shola Ama]] had a worldwide hit with her 1997 [[cover version|cover]] of "You Might Need Somebody".<ref name="Guinness Rockopedia"/>

Crawford recorded a live session with [[Joe Sample]] on July 24, 2007, at [[Abbey Road Studios]] for ''[[Live from Abbey Road]]''.
