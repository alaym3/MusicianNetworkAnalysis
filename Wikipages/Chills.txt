'''Chills''' is a feeling of coldness occurring during a high [[fever]], but sometimes is also a common [[symptom]] which occurs alone in specific people. It occurs during fever due to the release of [[cytokine]]s and [[prostaglandin]]s as part of the [[Inflammation|inflammatory response]], which increases the [[Thermoregulation#In humans|set point]] for body temperature in the [[hypothalamus]]. The increased set point causes the body [[temperature]] to rise ([[pyrexia]]), but also makes the patient feel cold or chills until the new set point is reached. [[Shivering]] also occurs along with chills because the patient's body produces heat during muscle contraction in a physiological attempt to increase body temperature to the new set point. When it does not accompany a high fever, it is normally a light chill. Sometimes a chill of medium power and short duration may occur during a scare, especially in scares of fear, commonly interpreted like or confused by [[Tremor|trembling]].

Severe chills with violent shivering are called '''rigors'''.

==Causes==

Chills are commonly caused by inflammatory diseases, such as the [[Influenza|flu]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Stan Tian |url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/11805/1/The-Main-Flu-Symptoms-Fever-Aches-and-Chills.html |title=The Main Flu Symptoms Fever, Aches and Chills |publisher=Healthguidance.org |date=2015-04-30 |access-date=2016-05-12}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=Content mill|date=March 2018}} It is also common in urinary tract infections. [[Malaria]] is one of the common reasons for chills and rigors. In malaria, the [[Parasitism|parasites]] enter the [[liver]], grow there and then attack the red blood cells which causes rupture of these cells and release of a toxic substance [[hemozoin]] which causes chills recurring every 3 to 4 days. Sometimes they happen in specific people almost all the time, in a slight power, or it less commonly happens in a generally healthy person.
