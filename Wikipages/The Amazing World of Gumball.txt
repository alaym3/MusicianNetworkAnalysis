'''''The Amazing World of Gumball''''' (abbreviated to '''''TAWOG''''', or referred to as simply '''''Gumball''''') is an [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Ben Bocquelet]] for [[Cartoon Network]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=27–28}}</ref> The series concerns the lives of 12-year-old [[List of The Amazing World of Gumball characters#Gumball Watterson|Gumball Watterson]], a blue cat, and his goldfish best friend and adoptive brother 10-year-old [[List of The Amazing World of Gumball characters#Darwin Watterson|Darwin]], who attend middle school in the fictional city of Elmore, California. They often find themselves in various shenanigans around the city, during which they interact with fellow family members—younger sister Anais, mother Nicole, and father Richard—[[List of The Amazing World of Gumball characters|and an extended supporting cast of characters]].

Bocquelet based several of the series' characters on rejected characters from his previous commercial work while making its premise a mixture of "family shows and school shows", which Cartoon Network was heavily interested in.<ref>{{Cite web|title=gumball|url=https://www.studiosoi.de/gumball|access-date=July 8, 2021|website=studio soi|language=en}}</ref> After Bocquelet pitched ''The Amazing World of Gumball'' to the network, [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]] executive Daniel Lennard green-lit the production of the series. It is the first to be produced by [[Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe|Cartoon Network Studios Europe]] (now Hanna-Barbera Studios Europe), with production association with [[Boulder Media Limited]] in [[Ireland]], Dandelion Studios in [[Japan]] (season 1), and Studio SOI in [[Germany]] (season 2 onward).

Gumball is noted for its intentional stylistic disunity, with characters designed, filmed, and animated using various styles and techniques, oftentimes within the same scene (stylised [[traditional animation]], [[puppetry]], [[computer animation|CGI]], [[stop motion]], [[Flash animation]], [[live-action]], etc.).<ref>[http://www.toonzone.net/2011/04/toonzone-interviews-the-amazing-world-of-gumball-creator-ben-bocquelet/ Interview with Ben Bocquelet] in Toonzone</ref> The series has received widespread critical acclaim and since developed a [[cult following]], with particular praises for its extensive references to [[Popular culture|popular]] and [[Internet culture|internet]] culture, [[sarcasm]], subtle [[Innuendo|innuendos]], and [[Black comedy|dark humour.]]<ref>{{Cite web|last=Alexander|first=Julia|date=February 17, 2017|title=Amazing World of Gumball perfectly tackles the biggest stereotypes found in RPGs|url=https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/2/17/14651050/amazing-world-of-gumball-the-console-rpg|access-date=July 8, 2021|website=Polygon|language=en}}</ref> Although a family comedy show, Gumball also handles serious subject matters, including [[philosophy]], [[marriage]], [[cyberbullying]], [[Bigotry|political intolerance]], [[Mental disorder|mental illness]], and the [[human condition]].

On September 6, 2016, Bocquelet announced the series would end after season 6; he reaffirmed his position on Twitter in October 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 3, 2016|title=The Amazing World of Gumball: Cartoon Network Series Ending?

==Premise==
{{further|List of The Amazing World of Gumball characters}}
The series revolves around the life of a 12-year-old cat named Gumball Watterson (Logan Grove, seasons 1–2 and season 3 episode: "The Kids"; [[Jacob Hopkins]], remainder of season 3 to season 5 episode "The Copycats"; Nicolas Cantu took over from him to season six; Duke Cutler from "The Gumball Chronicles" onward) and his frequent shenanigans in the fictional American city of Elmore, accompanied by his adopted goldfish brother and best friend Darwin ([[Kwesi Boakye]], season 1–2 and season 3 episode: "The Kids"; [[Terrell Ransom Jr.]], remainder of season 3 to season 5 episode "The Copycats"; Donielle T. Hansley Jr., remainder of season 5 to season 6 episode "The Cage"; Christian J. Simon, onward). Gumball's other family members—his intellectual sister Anais (Kyla Rae Kowalewski) and [[stay-at-home dad|stay-at-home father]] Richard (Dan Russell), both rabbits, and [[workaholic]] mother Nicole ([[Teresa Gallagher]]), a cat – often find themselves involved in Gumball's exploits. Gumball attends school with his siblings at Elmore Junior High, where throughout the series he interacts with his various middle school classmates, most prominently his love interest Penny Fitzgerald (also Gallagher).

One prominent feature of the series since its third season is "The Void", a dimension inside of Elmore where all the universe's mistakes reside. This includes references to aspects of reality as well as in-series elements. Rob (Charles Philipp, [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]] for episodes "The Nemesis" to "The Disaster", Hugo Harrison from "The Rerun" onwards) is a background character from the first two seasons who became trapped in The Void after becoming "irrelevant". He later escapes in Season 3, after which he becomes Gumball's nemesis and main antagonist. He is shown to be aware of his fictional existence in the Season 4 episode "The Disaster", and his hatred towards Gumball is a result of his role as the protagonist.<ref>{{cite AV media |date=September 6, 2016 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnn9eZ8Ap74 |title=Gumball {{!}} Gumball VS Rob {{!}} Cartoon Network |publisher=[[Cartoon Network]] |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=October 3, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210317232151/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnn9eZ8Ap74 |archive-date=March 17, 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref>
