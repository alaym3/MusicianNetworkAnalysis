==History==

===Jeff Killed John and record deal (1998–2005)===
Jeff Killed John was the forerunner band to Bullet for My Valentine and was formed in 1998 by Matthew Tuck, Michael "Padge" Paget, Nick Crandle, and Michael "Moose" Thomas while studying music at [[Bridgend College]]. They started playing [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] and [[Metallica]] [[cover songs]]. In 1999, the band released their first ever EP, [[Better Off Alone (EP)|Better Off Alone]]. They released another two-track [[extended play|EP]] in 2002, ''You/Play with Me'', which was produced by Greg Haver. The EP was financed through the Pynci scheme for new Welsh musicians and the release garnered radio airplay on [[BBC Radio 1]]'s broadcast at [[Newport, Wales|Newport]]'s [[T.J.'s]].<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine biography|work=BBC News|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/genres_artists/rock_pop/bfmv.shtml|access-date=8 April 2009}}</ref> Jeff Killed John's music followed the [[nu metal]] trend set by bands such as [[Korn]] and [[Limp Bizkit]].<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography" /> Shortly after, the band released another two-track [[extended play|EP]] titled ''Eye Spy''. In 2003, their second EP was released titled ''Don't Walk Away''. This was a promotional CD and was shipped to different record companies, as well as being given out locally in Bridgend. Bassist Crandle left the band on the eve of entering the recording sessions for the band's self-titled EP and was replaced by Jason James.<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography" /> The band then changed their name to Bullet for My Valentine and reworked their musical strategy; they decided to play heavy metal songs with "harmony guitars and big angelic choruses," according to frontman Tuck.<ref name="R13 interview" /> In late 2003, they released their final EP before record labels actually began to notice their potential. This happened due to the sudden change in their strategy and sound, which the band claims came "directly out of their heads."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://myspace.com/jeffkjohn|title=Jeff Killed John|work=Myspace}}</ref> Their self-titled EP consisted of five songs; most of the songs became precursors of tracks from ''[[The Poison]]''.

[[Roadrunner Records]] showed interest in Bullet for My Valentine and offered the band a deal. The offer was ultimately turned down, and the band signed a five-album record deal with [[Sony BMG]] and a UK licensing deal with [[Visible Noise]]. According to Tuck, they chose Sony because, "We thought that a lot more doors would be open to us."<ref name="R13 interview">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine Interview|publisher=Room Thirteen|date=8 July 2005|url=http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=185|access-date=30 October 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071112164113/http://www.roomthirteen.com/cgi-bin/feature_view.cgi?FeatureID=185 |archive-date = 12 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> A [[Bullet for My Valentine (EP)|self-titled]] EP was released on 15 November 2004 in the UK. Produced by [[Colin Richardson]], it featured five tracks and marked the band's first official release.<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine biography" /> A second EP, ''[[Hand of Blood]],'' was released on 22 August 2005 through [[Trustkill Records]] and was only available in the U.S.; the release contained one extra track than the self-titled EP, "4 Words (To Choke Upon)." Daniel Lukes of ''[[Decibel Magazine]]'' reviewed the EP by stating, "The worst part is that the music itself isn't all that bad, for the genre." He went on to comment that the band should be "embarrassed" about the release.<ref name="Screamocore takes a dump where it eats">{{cite web|title=Screamocore takes a dump where it eats|author=Lukes, Daniel|work=[[Decibel (magazine)|Decibel]]|url=http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/sep2005/bullet_for_my_valentine.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060506025905/http://www.decibelmagazine.com/reviews/sep2005/bullet_for_my_valentine.aspx|archive-date=6 May 2006|access-date=9 November 2007}}</ref> [[Zero Magazine (music magazine)|Zero Magazine's]] Josh Joyce complimented the band on "how technical they can get without confusing the kids."<ref name="Bullet for My Valentine&nbsp;— Hand of Blood EP">{{cite web|title=Bullet for My Valentine – Hand of Blood EP|author=Joyce, Josh|work=[[Zero Magazine (music magazine)|Zero Magazine]]|url=http://www.zeromag.com/articles/cd_view.php?id=924&pi=0|access-date=9 November 2007|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090918140331/http://www.zeromag.com/articles/cd_view.php?id=924&pi=0|archive-date=18 September 2009}}</ref>

=== Self-titled seventh album (2020–present) ===
On 19 May 2020, in an interview with ''[[Rock Sound]]'', Tuck announced that the band was in the process of writing a new album. After several mixed-to-negative reviews by critics on ''Gravity'', they decided to working on a new record which would be 'heavier' compared to the latest album. However, the production of the upcoming release, confirmed to be once again produced by Carl Bown, has been delayed due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. Tuck commented about the upcoming album: "So it's not ideal, and we did have a lot of plans for the rest of the year for writing and making the record, which are on the backburner now until further notice. [...] It's pretty brutal, to be honest. It couldn't be more of a contrast with ''Gravity'' in a ferocious style. It's very technical. [...] The riffs are crushing. There's probably 60 percent aggressive vocals, 40 [percent] clean, which is a ratio we've never really dabbled with before. [...] It's very heavy, it's very technical. For the Bullet fans out there that kind of like that side of this band, it's very cool and very exciting. It feels good."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/news/music/bullet-for-my-valentine-brutal-heavy-and-technical-new-album-update-2671908|title=Bullet For My Valentine are working on a "brutal, heavy, and technical" new album|publisher=NME|access-date=18 June 2021|date=19 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://loudwire.com/bullet-for-my-valentine-new-album-brutal-technical/|title=Bullet for My Valentine's New Album Is 'Brutal' + 'Technical'|publisher=Loudwire|access-date=19 June 2021|date=20 May 2020}}</ref>
