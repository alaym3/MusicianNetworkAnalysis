==Early life and career==
John William Peter Newman was born in [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]] in the [[Yorkshire Dales]] and attended [[Settle College]]. When Newman was six years old, his father left the family, leaving his mother Jackie, his older brother [[James Newman (musician)|James]], and him with a pound a day.<ref>{{cite news|last=Teeman|first=Tim|title=John Newman interview: 'There are too many celebrities and not enough artists.'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jan/20/john-newman-interview-uk-tour|access-date=20 January 2014|newspaper=The Guardian|date=20 January 2014}}</ref> In his youth Newman was influenced by [[Motown]] and [[Stax Records|Stax]] that he heard via his mother. He was also influenced by the [[Northern soul]] sound, which also influenced his dance style. Many over 30s from Settle would leave on a weekend to go to Northern soul nights all over Yorkshire.<ref name="Front Row">{{cite AV media|title=Front Row|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03k2btm/|publisher=BBC | access-date= 5 December 2013}}</ref> He started playing guitar and writing his own songs at the age of 14 and soon learned how to record and produce himself, even making his own house tracks and DJing.<ref name="birth">{{cite web |title=About John Newman |url=http://johnnewman.co.uk/?page_id=2 |publisher=Johnnewman.co.uk |date=2 May 2012 |access-date=9 August 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027213755/http://www.johnnewman.co.uk/?page_id=2 |archive-date=27 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

At the age of sixteen, Newman moved to [[Leeds]] and it was here that he developed his voice and sound. It was whilst he was in Leeds that two of his best friends (both involved in professional [[downhill mountain biking]]) died in a car crash. Newman said, "In that first year of moving to Leeds, instead of being sat with books all over the library desk and studying music, I actually studied it in a totally different way.... because of what I was going through, and I was getting smashed every night and enjoying the student life but then sitting with a guitar and crying all night writing music."<ref name="Front Row"/> It was whilst in Leeds that he also found other people who appreciated Motown and Stax music and a time that Newman said "matured me in a musical way so much, I was writing pop music and now I feel like I'm writing music that I love and can really attach to."<ref name="Front Row"/>

At the age of twenty, Newman moved to London, started a band, played live and was signed to [[Island Records]].<ref name="birth" /> While working at [[The Silver Bullet]] bar, he made friends with Piers Agget, one fourth of [[Rudimental]].<ref name=DistrictMTV>{{cite web|last=Langford|first=Georgina|title=DistrictMTV|url=http://www.districtmtv.co.uk/article/topic/music/nlucws/john-newman-interview/gk8qwq|access-date=10 March 2014|date=28 June 2013}}</ref> He released "Cheating" as a download song and plays an acoustic version of the track at gigs.<ref>{{cite web|title=John Newman Cheating acoustic new music|url=http://www.soulculture.co.uk/music-blog/newmusic/john-newman-cheating-acoustic-new-music/|publisher=Soulculture.co.uk | access-date=24 January 2013|date=5 June 2012}}</ref>
