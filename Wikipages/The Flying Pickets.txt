'''The Flying Pickets''' are a British ''[[a cappella]]'' [[vocal group]] who had a [[List of Christmas number one singles (UK)|Christmas number one]] [[hit record|hit]] in 1983 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] with their [[cover version]] of [[Yazoo (band)|Yazoo]]'s track "[[Only You (Yazoo song)|Only You]]".

==History==
The band of six was founded by [[Brian Hibbard]] in 1982 from a group of [[actor]]s who had been active with him in [[John McGrath (playwright)|John McGrath]]'s [[7:84|7:84 theatre group]], a fringe theatre organisation who had sung ''a cappella'' in their production of the 1981 play ''One Big Blow''. The group chose the name The Flying Pickets as band members had played a part in the UK miners' strikes of [[UK miners' strike (1972)|1972]] and [[Three-Day Week|1974]].<ref name="walesonline.co.uk">[http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/minersstrike/2009/04/12/the-flying-pickets-taste-of-fame-91466-23366979/ "The Flying Pickets’ taste of fame"], ''WalesOnline'', 12 April 2009 (updated 29 March 2013). Accessed 12 July 2009.</ref>

Performing in clubs and pubs in [[London]], The Flying Pickets came up with a novel concept of transferring the art of ''a cappella'' to the [[pop music]] scene.<ref>Anderson, D. (1991), "Bums on Seats: Parties, Art, and Politics in London's East End", ''TDR'' vol. '''35''' (1) pp. 43-59.</ref><ref name="allmusic">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-flying-pickets-mn0000802484/biography|title=The Flying Pickets Biography|last=Torreano|first=Bradley|publisher=AllMusic|access-date=25 October 2020}}</ref> Joining Hibbard in the group were [[Rick Lloyd]] (who also wrote the music to ''One Big Blow''), Gareth Williams, [[David Brett]], Ken Gregson (real name Kenneth Gregory) and Red Stripe (real name David Gittins).<ref name="Larkin">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=Colin Larkin|editor-link=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=475}}</ref> The members of the group were internationally renowned for their flamboyant appearance: Hibbard's huge sideburns, Stripe's thick eye-liner, and the others showing off gaudy suits and large hats. Two of the other original members, [[Ron Donachie]] and [[Christopher Ryan]] left the band before "Only You".

"Only You", their first [[single (music)|single]], was the UK Christmas number one in 1983 spending a total of five weeks at the top,<ref name="Larkin"/> and also doing well around [[Europe]] and in [[Canada]], where it reached number 17 in spring 1984. It emulated the success of the original Yazoo version. The official Flying Pickets website states that the video was shot in the Red Duster in South Shields.

The name "Flying Pickets" refers to mobile strikers who travel in order to join a [[Picketing (protest)|picket]], reflecting the group's radical [[socialist]] political views. The height of the group's fame coincided with the [[UK miners' strike (1984–85)|1984 miners strike]], when the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]] called strike action following the [[National Coal Board]]'s decision to close 20 pits – a move which would claim some 20,000 jobs.<ref name="walesonline.co.uk"/> The Flying Pickets were vocal in their support of the miners during the dispute and came to blows with the record label Virgin after they picketed [[Drax Power Station]] in Yorkshire.<ref name="Anderson" /> They also performed benefit gigs for the miners.<ref name="Larkin"/> Hibbard himself claimed that their political beliefs probably had a detrimental effect on the group's mainstream image but it was a sacrifice they were willing to make;<ref name="Anderson" /> one well known record store{{which|date=December 2013}} refused to sell the group's albums due to their support of strike action.<ref name="Anderson" />

Despite the group's socialist views, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]] proclaimed, to much amusement, that "Only You" was her favourite record.<ref name="Anderson">Anderson, D. (1991), "Bums on Seats: Parties, Art, and Politics in London's East End", ''TDR'' vol. '''35''' (1) p. 55</ref> A second single, a cover version of [[Van McCoy]]'s "[[When You're Young and in Love|(When You're) Young and in Love]]" (originally written for [[Ruby and the Romantics]]) reached number 7 in the UK, but their third, a cover of the [[Eurythmics]]' "[[Who's That Girl? (Eurythmics song)|Who's That Girl]]" barely [[record chart|charted]].<ref name="Larkin"/>

In 1986, Hibbard and Stripe left the band and were replaced by Gary Howard and Hereward Kaye.<ref>Kaye, H., (1986) [http://www.herewardkaye.com/baba.html "Ba Ba Da Da The Flying Pickets - 1986"]. Accessed 30 March 2007.</ref> Hibbard and Stripe tried to stay in the [[music industry]], forming their own act called Brian and Stripe, but their first and only single, a cover version of Yazoo's "[[Mr Blue (Yazoo song)|Mr. Blue]]", failed to chart, and they returned to their separate acting careers.

The group sang two songs on the [[Eric Woolfson]]/[[Alan Parsons]] 1990 album [[Freudiana]].

The Flying Pickets' line-up has changed throughout the years, but the band never died; since the Pickets began, there have been about 27 members. The last member of the original line-up, David Brett, left the band in 1990.<ref name="Original_website">[http://www.theflyingpickets.co.uk/ "The Original Flying Pickets"]. Accessed 30 March 2007.</ref> However, in 1994, the original line-up (minus Lloyd) reformed to record one more album.<ref name="Original_website" />

Although none of the founding members has been part of the band since 1990, The Flying Pickets continue to record albums and to tour all over Europe and abroad.
