== History ==
Iklim was founded in [[Terengganu]] and began when singers AM Salim Abdul Majeed, or Saleem-Iklim, in 1988, appointed a number of friends and young villagers to establish a singing group. In early 1989, before creating the name, Iklim often performed at clubs and ceremonies around the state.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F9%2F29%2Fmusic%2F14861292&sec=music |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724021007/http://ecentral.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F9%2F29%2Fmusic%2F14861292&sec=music |archive-date=2011-07-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1990, SCS Record made Iklim's first album recording. The debut single, "Suci Dalam Debu", became a hit. Other singles, such as "Hakikat Sebuah Cinta", "Satu Kesan Abadi", "Sandiwara Cinta Semusim Ammarah Bujang Kota" and "Seribu Penghargaan", were popular in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]] during the early 1990s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://malay.de-expert.web.id/sejarah-iklim-dan-saleem/ |title=Sejarah Iklim dan Saleem |website=Malay.de-expert.web.id |date=2010-04-13 |accessdate=2010-05-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100402115940/http://malay.de-expert.web.id/sejarah-iklim-dan-saleem/ |archive-date=2010-04-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Members ==
Originally, the Iklim group comprised five young people: AM Saleem Abdul Majid, Umarul Mahdzar, Mohd Salim, Suhaimi Kamaruddin and Fadhil. However, fragmentation occurred when a second guitarist, Fadhil Suhaimi, left the band during the process of recording the first album. He was replaced by Huzali Ali as the instrument board tone player on the first album.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://duck.fm/Iklim/bio |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-05-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720200229/http://duck.fm/Iklim/bio |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Iklim|title=Iklim music|website=Last.fm|accessdate=14 October 2018}}</ref> In 1995, Saleem Abdul Majid left Iklim.
