'''Water Liars''' is an American rock band from Water Valley, Mississippi, that included songwriter/vocalist/guitarist Justin Peter Kinkel-Schuster, drummer/producer/multi-instrumentalist Andrew Bryant,<ref name="auto">http://nodepression.com/interview/“build-shit-right”-lost-interview-water-liars</ref> and bassist GR Robinson.  Their name is derived from the first story in [[Barry Hannah]]'s collection ''Airships''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cmj.com/feature/qa-water-liars/|title=Interview: Water Liars' Justin Kinkel-Schuster Talks 'Wyoming'|work=CMJ}}</ref>

== History ==
Bryant was on a solo tour in the mid-2000s with Matt Arbogast from The Gunshy. Justin Peter Kinkel-Schuster lived in St. Louis at the time and was playing with a band called Theodore.<ref name="Allmusic bio">{{cite web|last1=Thomas|first1=Fred|title=Water Liars Biography|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/water-liars-mn0002849245/biography|website=Allmusic|accessdate=2 August 2015}}</ref> Theodore was the show's opener that night.  "We hit it off, stayed in touch and over the years, we played whenever we could," Kinkel-Schuster said in an interview with ''A Beer with the Band''.<ref name="abeerwiththeband.com">{{cite web|url=http://abeerwiththeband.com/a-beer-with-water-liars/|title=A Beer with Water Liars - A Beer with the Band|work=abeerwiththeband.com}}</ref>

===''Phantom Limb'' (2011–2012)===
In 2011, on a whim, Kinkel-Schuster went to visit Bryant in Bryant's hometown of [[Water Valley, Mississippi]].  They began writing songs and in three days the duo had recorded, with only one microphone, what would be their first full-length record as Water Liars, ''Phantom Limb''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://djournal.com/lifestyle/water-liars-north-mississippi-allstars-play-main/|title=Water Liars, North Mississippi Allstars to play Down on Main|work=Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal}}</ref><ref name="NPR 2012 song of the day">{{cite web|last1=Thompson|first1=Stephen|authorlink1=Stephen Thompson (journalist)|title=Water Liars: Starkly Sweet|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/03/12/148105784/water-liars-starkly-sweet|website=National Public Radio|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=12 March 2012}}</ref>  The record was originally released on February 28, 2012, by Pennsylvania record label Misra Records.  According to the Misra website, "Misra initially planned to work with Theodore and, assuming the ''Phantom Limb'' songs were mere outtakes under a different name, the Water Liars demos initially got pushed to the back burner.  Kinkel-Schuster pleasantly persisted, however, insisting the project was vastly different and Misra must hear it. The label took to the recordings and released ''Phantom Limb''."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.misrarecords.com/collections/water-liars|title=Water Liars|work=Misra Records}}</ref> The record features 10 songs which feature a heavy distorted guitar sound, field recordings of frogs singing in a train yard and a sample of British occultist Aleister Crowley's recitation of his poem "Atomic Ritual."

===''Wyoming'' (2013)===
A year later, on March 5, 2013, Water Liars released their sophomore effort, ''Wyoming'', on Big Legal Mess, an independent label in Oxford, Mississippi, with affiliations to [[Fat Possum Records]].<ref name="NY Times Wyoming">{{cite news|last1=Caramanica|first1=Jon|title=Heartbreaking News, Heavenly Exhortations and Lonely Sentiments|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/arts/music/new-music-from-chvrches-tasha-cobbs-and-water-liars.html?_r=0|accessdate=2 August 2015|work=The New York Times|date=22 Mar 2013|quote=dark, lonely, roots-minded indie rock}}</ref>  ''Wyoming'' was recorded in Water Valley at Dial Back Sounds in six days, tracking for three and mixing for three.<ref name="abeerwiththeband.com"/>  Bruce Watson, whose previous credits include work with A.A. Bondy, engineered the record.  This record includes Matt Patton of [[Drive-By Truckers]] on bass.  The record features nine songs.  "''Wyoming'' hopefully represents something larger or represents a place inside of me or whoever. It's less of a specific place and more of a strange American place that you want to get to but don't really ever," Kinkel-Schuster said of the naming of the record.<ref name="auto"/>

===''Water Liars'' (2014)===
On March 3, 2014, Water Liars released their third record on Big Legal Mess/Fat Possum.<ref name="PopMatters Water Liars review">{{cite web|last1=Rea|first1=Robert W.|title=Water Liars: Water Liars|url=http://www.popmatters.com/review/180273-water-liars-water-liars/|website=PopMatters|accessdate=2 August 2015|date=18 Feb 2014}}</ref>  The eleven song record was recorded at Dial Back Sounds in ten days over the course of three months on the weekends with Kinkel-Schuster commuting from Louisville, Kentucky. This is the first record to feature bassist and Water Liars' touring musician, GR Robinson.  According to ''Paste'' magazine, "The self-titled release maintains the band's raw aesthetic, emphasizing their evolution since ''Wyoming'' without feeling over-produced or manufactured. Finding art in contradiction, Water Liars combines violent, vivid lyrics with sentimental undertones, making for a rough yet deeply moving collection of songs that not only make for great listening, but incite a kind of curiosity in the listener that can only be attributed to this multi-dimentional lyricism."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.waterliarsmusic.com/albums/self-titled/|title=Water Liars » Self-Titled|work=waterliarsmusic.com}}</ref>

=== ''Roll On (2020)'' ===
The band's "lost album" was released on July 3, 2020 on Kinkel-Schuster's newly launched record label Constant Stranger. Originally recorded in 2015 with [[Matt Pence]] at Echo Lab in [[Argyle, Texas]], the 10-track album was never released due to a series of mishaps, including their label collapsing. The band broke up shortly after.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Water Liars' Roll On out at midnight|url=https://www.constantstranger.com/news/roll-on|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Constant Stranger|language=en-US}}</ref> “Roll On” was produced and recorded as a platform to launch the band towards more commercial success, while staying true to their style and songwriting traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|title='Things Happen the Way they Ought to': Pandemic inspires Fayetteville songwriter to release album from now-defunct band|url=https://www.fayettevilleflyer.com/2020/08/17/things-happen-the-way-they-ought-to-pandemic-inspires-fayetteville-songwriter-to-release-album-from-now-defunct-band/|access-date=2020-11-24|website=Fayetteville Flyer|language=en-US}}</ref> Matt Ruppert, writing for These Subtle Sounds, describes the album as "a rock and roll record, writ large and as thunderous as a lightning-bright hailstorm, alternating between crashing and calm."<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ruppert|first=Matthew|date=July 14, 2020|title=Finding a Way On the Darkest Road: Roll On by Water Liars|url=https://thesesubtlesounds.com/finding-a-way-on-the-darkest-road-roll-on-by-water-liars/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=November 23, 2020|website=These Subtle Sounds}}</ref>

==Influences==
Kinkel-Schuster grew up in Greenwood, Arkansas,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.arkansasonline.com/news/2013/jun/06/water-liars-tells-stories-tandem-writing--20130606/|title=Water Liars tells stories with tandem writing style|work=Arkansas Online}}</ref> and Bryant was raised in the church in Mississippi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ghettoblastermagazine.com/2015/finding-my-religion-an-interview-with-andrew-bryant/|title=Finding My Religion; An interview with Andrew Bryant|work=ghettoblastermagazine.com}}</ref>  Both cite the South as a major influence in their writing and songs.  "I don't know how you could be from a certain place or area or region and not have it affect the way that you see things. Some places it's inevitable that that will happen. We cultivate it, too, and we're proud of it. It's definitely in there, but it's not like where we're from is the only thing that defines what we're trying to do. But it's in there. It's deep in there and it's not going anywhere," Kinkel-Schuster said.<ref name="abeerwiththeband.com"/>

The late [[Jason Molina]] of the band Songs: Ohia is also a great influence, "If you're gonna say there's one thing that influenced what I do now, it has to be the drum sounds. Because I play a lot like that guy does. My favorite style of drumming is on their records. I definitely model what I do after that. I mean, I don't try to do what they do, but that's just the way I like to play. It's just got that kind of '90s sound to it. Maybe also mixed with shit I heard my dad listening to in the car when I was a kid, which was probably '70s music," Bryant said.<ref name="auto"/>

They are also influenced by many Southern writers, including Barry Hannah, [[Frank Stanford]], and [[Flannery O'Conner]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2015/jul/30/southern-guys-swim-music-scene-as-water/|title=Music: Southern guys 'swim' music scene as Water Liars|work=Arkansas Online}}</ref>
