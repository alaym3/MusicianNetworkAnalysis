'''Sam Lowry Hunt''' (born December 8, 1984) is an American <!-- genre debate seems just too polarizing for the lede --> singer and songwriter. Born in [[Cedartown, Georgia]], Hunt played [[American football|football]] in his high school and college years and once attempted to pursue a professional sports career before signing with [[Universal Music Group Nashville#MCA Nashville|MCA Nashville]] in 2014.

Prior to his successful solo career, Hunt was credited for writing singles for [[Kenny Chesney]], [[Keith Urban]], [[Billy Currington]], and [[Reba McEntire]]. His debut studio album, ''[[Montevallo (album)|Montevallo]]'', broke several chart records with five singles spawned from the record, including three consecutive [[Hot Country Songs]] chart and four [[Country Airplay]] chart number ones. The lead single from the album, "[[Leave the Night On]]", peaked concurrently on the Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, making Hunt the first country artist in 22 years, since [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], to reach the top of three country charts simultaneously in the [[Nielsen SoundScan]]-era.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6312087/sam-hunt-scores-country-charts-feat-last-achieved-22-years-ago |title=Sam Hunt Scores Country Charts Feat Last Achieved 22 Years Ago|author= Wade Jessen |date= November 7, 2014 |work=Billboard}}</ref> He is also the first country artist since [[Clint Black]] to occupy both year-end number one album and single with ''Montevallo'' and "[[Take Your Time (Sam Hunt song)|Take Your Time]]".<ref>[http://search.proquest.com/docview/1648505508] {{dead link|date=January 2017}}</ref><ref name="billboard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2015/hot-country-songs|title=Year End Charts - Year-end Singles - Hot Country Songs |website=Billboard.com |access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref><ref name="billboard2">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/year-end/2015/top-country-albums|title=Year End Charts - Year-end Albums - Top Country Albums |website=Billboard.com |access-date=2015-12-10}}</ref> The fifth single "[[Make You Miss Me]]" from ''Montevallo'', hit number one on the Country Airplay chart, thus making Hunt the first solo male artist to land four number ones on the Country Airplay chart from a debut studio album.<ref>{{cite web|author=Keith Caulfield |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7487760/billboard-200-chart-moves-stranger-things-soundtrack |title=200 Chart Moves: 'Stranger Things' Soundtrack Makes Strong Debut |website=Billboard.com |date=2016-08-26 |access-date=2017-01-26}}</ref><ref name="billboard2" />

Since the launch of his career, Hunt has quickly received recognition from both inside and outside the country music community for his blending of genres, <!-- "boundary-breaking" sounds way too biased --> incorporating use of [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]] into the production and songwriting of his songs. He has been honored with numerous awards, including one [[American Music Award]], and one [[CMT Music Awards|CMT Music Award]], as well as nominations for [[Billboard Music Award|''Billboard'' Music Awards]] and [[Grammy Award]]s.

== Artistry ==

=== Vocals ===
Writing for ''Billboard'', Elias Leight observed on Hunt's vocal performance, describing his vocal performance in studio sessions as a "rough, heartthrob voice [that] shines clearly", but noted that his live vocals "[weren't] always easy to hear." Leight further praised Hunt's delivery to be "a mix of speaking and rapid-fire singing that sets him apart from other country singers," but commented its impact was diminished because of his live singing. Finally, Hunt's live performance of "Make You Miss Me" rendered the music writer "the clearest glimpse of his husky mid-range, smooth but rugged voice" in a setting where "there were no beats crowding him or guitars to compete with."<ref name=Billb2>{{cite web|last1=Leight|first1=Elias|title=Sam Hunt Erases Boundaries Between Country & Other Genres at NYC Show|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6472469/sam-hunt-new-york-show-live-review|website=Billboard.com|access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>

=== Influences ===
Hunt's music contains elements of [[Country music|country]], [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] and [[Pop music|pop]]. [[Dwight Yoakam]], while speaking to ''Entertainment Tonight'', commented on Hunt's music, saying "It reminds me a little bit of, with the infusion of soul and southern R&B, with the things that happened surrounding the album that Ray Charles put out – the very historic album ''The Modern Sounds of Country Music'' back in the early '60s[...] It was a reinterpretation that not only intrigued country audiences at the time, but it brought a brand new audience to the country music world."<ref name=ET1>{{cite web|last1=Schillaci|first1=Sophie|title=Dwight Yoakam Compares Sam Hunt to Ray Charles: He's Bringing 'A Brand New Audience' to Country|url=http://www.etonline.com/music/164437_dwight_yoakam_compares_sam_hunt_to_ray_charles_he_bringing_a_brand_new_audience_to_country/|publisher=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=15 December 2015}}</ref> His songwriting was heavily influenced by [[Brad Paisley]], whose early hit "[[He Didn't Have to Be]]" had a big impact on him as a kid growing up in Georgia:<ref name="pro.krmd-fm.tritonflex.com">{{cite web |url=http://pro.krmd-fm.tritonflex.com/common/more.php?m=58&ts=1414058454&article=1A5F068C5A9C11E4B51EFEFDADE6840A&mode=2 |title=Sam Hunt Opens Up About His Unlikely Classic Country Influences |date=October 28, 2014 |work=Nash FM 101.1 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150210125812/http://pro.krmd-fm.tritonflex.com/common/more.php?m=58&ts=1414058454&article=1A5F068C5A9C11E4B51EFEFDADE6840A&mode=2 |archive-date=February 10, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> "I remember being at church on Wednesday night at Wednesday night supper, and getting the keys from my mom well before it was over to just go sit in the car and to turn the radio on and hopefully wait and catch that song."<ref name="pro.krmd-fm.tritonflex.com"/> He also cites [[Billy Currington]], [[Usher (singer)|Usher]], [[K-Ci & JoJo]], [[R. Kelly]], [[Ginuwine]]<ref name="tasteofcountry.com"/> and [[Alice Cooper]]<ref name="pro.krmd-fm.tritonflex.com"/> as musical influences.

=== Lyrical and musical style ===
Hunt told ''[[Taste of Country]]'' that he does not write his songs with a specific genre in mind, but rather follows his instinct.<ref name="tasteofcountry.com">{{cite web |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/sam-hunt-interview-leave-the-night-on-r-and-b-influences/ |title=Sam Hunt Interview: 'Leave the Night On' Singer Shares His R&B Influences |author= Billy Dukes |date= August 14, 2014 |work=Taste of Country }}</ref> "I want to sound different than everybody else," said Hunt talking about his musical style. "To use a football phrase, I try to zig when other people zag."<ref name=Billb1 /> Commenting on his interpretation of country music, he told ''Rolling Stone Country'', "I think country songs are truthful songs about life written by country people, but the beats and sounds will continue to evolve."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Moss|first1=Marissa R.|title=Watch Sam Hunt Throw a 'House Party' on 'Fallon' |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/videos/watch-sam-hunt-throw-a-house-party-on-fallon-20150819#ixzz3k2LjqSc4|publisher=Rolling Stone|access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref> Billy Dukes of ''Taste of Country'', on observing "[[Break Up in a Small Town]]", referred the song as "likely the wordiest song of 2015" and Hunt's "most genre-bending release to country radio", adding "Any talk of which genre Hunt belongs in misses the point. His story hits hard. It's deep and emotional and sincere and all the things we expect from a great country song."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dukes|first1=Billy|title=Sam Hunt, 'Break Up in a Small Town' [Listen] |url=http://tasteofcountry.com/sam-hunt-break-up-in-a-small-town/|access-date=23 September 2015}}</ref>

In a 2015 interview with ''Billboard'', Hunt remarked on the position of women in his music, "Respect for women was a very important part of my upbringing," and added, "The women in my life demanded that from me." Hunt even named his album ''Montevallo'', after the hometown of his wife, Hannah Lee Fowler, and consulted her in the lyrical production: "I spent a lot of time talking to her about the songs and asking, 'What do you think about this?' Her perspective was a powerful part of me being able to connect with a female audience, not just a male audience."<ref name=Billb1>{{cite web|last1=Payne|first1=Chris|title=Billboard Cover Sneak Peek: 5 Ways Sam Hunt Is Breaking Down Country Stereotypes|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/country/6670464/sam-hunt-billboard-cover-sneak-peek|website=Billboard.com|access-date=27 August 2015}}</ref>

In a June 2018 interview with ''Taste of Country'', Hunt said that his upcoming second album will be much like ''Montevallo'', but after the release of the second album he plans to "get back to the foundation of the musical genre that he identifies with".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tasteofcountry.com/sam-hunt-new-country-music-interview-2018/|title=Sam Hunt, Country Traditionalist? It's Burning Within Him|website=Tasteofcountry.com}}</ref> In the same interview, he said "at some point" that his music will sound more like traditional country musician [[Tyler Childers]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theboot.com/sam-hunt-tyler-childers-traditional/|title=Sam Hunt is Reaching Back to His Country Roots for New Music|website=Theboot.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==

===Legal issues===
