'''Víctor Manuel Ruiz Velázquez''' (born September 27, 1968), known professionally as '''Víctor Manuelle''', is a successful [[Latin Grammy]] nominated American [[Salsa music|salsa]] singer, known to his fans as ''El Sonero de la Juventud'' ("The Singer Of Youths").<ref>[https://www-imer-mx.translate.goog/tropicalisima/25-anos-del-sonero-de-la-juventud-victor-manuelle-25-7/?_x_tr_sl=es&_x_tr_tl=en&_x_tr_hl=en&_x_tr_pto=nui,sc 25 years of the Sonero de la Juventud: Víctor Manuelle 7/25]</ref>  He is identified primarily with ''[[salsa romántica]] or "salsa monga".'' Víctor Manuelle has neither recorded in English, nor made a [[Latin pop]] album, nor (with rare exceptions) ventured into acting, preferring to remain a musician grounded within salsa music.

==Discovery and early career==
Ruiz is the son of Víctor Manuel Ruiz, Sr. (1939-2018) and Jenny Velásquez. Both parents are [[Puerto Ricans]] and he has a brother called Héctor Gustavo Ruiz.
Although born in [[New York City]], Victor was raised primarily in [[Isabela, Puerto Rico]], where he enjoyed salsa music. His singing career began because of [[Gilberto Santa Rosa]], during a concert at his high school's graduation party by salsa superstar. At the instigation of classmates, who were going on about their friend the ''sonero'', Santa Rosa invited Victor to jump up on stage and sing a song with him. To Santa Rosa's surprise, not only could Victor sing, but he "free-styled" the improvisational ''soneo'' lyrics in the song, and traded ''soneos'' with Santa Rosa.  Shortly thereafter, on Santa Rosa's recommendation, Puerto Rican bandleader Don Periñon hired teenage Victor as a backup singer.<ref name="San Juan, Puerto Rico 2014">{{cite web | title=Víctor Manuelle – Fundación Nacional para la Cultura Popular | website=San Juan, Puerto Rico | date=6 July 2014 | url=https://prpop.org/biografias/victor-manuelle/ | language=es | access-date=7 June 2020}}</ref>

==1990s–2000s==
Manuelle emerged as a leading voice among the generation of [[New York City|New York]] salsa performers who rose to prominence in the mid-'90s, along with [[Marc Anthony]] and [[La India]], who were his only rivals in terms of success and popularity. Mentored by Gilberto Santa Rosa and produced by [[Sergio George]],<ref>[https://universalattractions.com/artists/victor-manuelle/ Victor Manuelle]</ref> Manuelle regularly topped the tropical charts during his mid-'90s peak, as his albums Victor Manuelle (1996) and [[A Pesar de Todo]] (1997) spun off a parade of number one hits. The esteemed sonero continued his hit-making in the years that followed, as every single one of his studio albums in the successive decade spun off at least one tropical chart-topper of its own.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/latin/7431145/victor-manuelle-most-tropical-songs-no-1-marc-anthony/ Victor Manuelle Rewrites Record for Most Tropical Songs No. 1s]</ref>

Manuelle has become one of the best-selling salsa performers of recent years, with his albums selling a combined 1 million-plus copies in the U.S. Three studio albums, 1999's ''Inconfundible'' ("Unmistakable"), 2001's ''Instinto Y Deseo'' ("Instinct and Desire") and 2004's ''Travesía'' ("Crossover"), have cracked Billboard's overall Top 200 Albums chart,<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/music/victor-manuelle Victor Manuelle]</ref> and the latter two reached #1 on the Latin Album chart (''Inconfundible'' reached #2). While several of his singles have made the Top 5 or Top 10 on the Latin charts, he had to wait for 2004's ''Tengo Ganas'' ("I'm in the Mood") to score a Billboard #1 Latin hit.

Perhaps his moment of greatest visibility came when he, to the happy surprise of the attendees, sang an [[a cappella]] version of [[Celia Cruz]]'s signature song, ''La Vida Es Un Carnaval'' ("Life is a Carnival"), at her funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York in July 2003.<ref>[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2003-07-23-0307220553-story.html St. Patrick's Cathedral NEW YORK FANS SING, DANCE IN CELEBRATION OF SALSA QUEEN'S LIFE]</ref>  This scene was replayed numerous times in the ensuing days on [[List of Spanish-language television networks in the United States|Spanish-language television]]. Manuelle had performed the song for Cruz, with full orchestra, at a televised tribute concert for her, the last concert at which she ever performed on stage.

==Recent activity==
Manuelle's most recent production was released in May 2009. However, on this disc, not all of his songs have to do with topics of "LOVE", "INFIDELITY", etc. Nonetheless, it does include various interludes where he explains the meaning of songs related to his personal life, which is why the album is called; "Muy Personal"(Very Personal)

Manuelle released his 10th studio album, ''Decisión Unánime'' ("Unanimous Decision"), in May 2005.  Six months earlier, in November 2005, he and his mentor, Gilberto Santa Rosa, released a joint live album, ''Dos Soneros, Una Historia'' ("Two Soneros, One History"), recorded at [[Coliseo Roberto Clemente]] outside [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]].  Manuelle's own live album, ''Víctor Manuelle En Vivo: Desde El Carnegie Hall'', came out in early 2005.<ref>[https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/fl-xpm-2009-02-19-0902230192-story.html Two great soneros]</ref> He served as co-host of the [[7th Annual Latin Grammy Awards]], held November 2, 2006, in New York.

Manuelle's first foray into movie acting was his cameo role (mostly singing) as salsa legend [[Rubén Blades]] in ''[[El Cantante]]'', the 2007 film biography of [[Héctor Lavoe]], starring [[Marc Anthony]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]. In the movie he sang an acoustic version in a club of the famous [[El cantante (Héctor Lavoe song)|El Cantante]] On June 10, 2008, Manuelle released the album ''Soy'' ("I am). He was one of several artists selected to perform at the "KQ Live Concert" on September 27, 2008, organized by KQ 105 FM. The event included several renowned artists from Puerto Rico and other Latin American countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/musica/espectaculos_asi/mezcla_de_generos_en_una_sola_tarima/216805|title=Mezcla de géneros en una sola tarima |author=Aixa Sepúlveda Morales|newspaper=Primera Hora|language=es |date=2008-08-05|access-date=2008-08-11|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130001722/http://www.primerahora.com/noticia/musica/espectaculos_asi/mezcla_de_generos_en_una_sola_tarima/216805|archive-date=January 30, 2009}}</ref>
