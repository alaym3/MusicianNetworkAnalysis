''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]'' selected the band as one of 25 Must-Hear Artists from the 2009 [[CMJ|CMJ Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.spin.com/gallery/25-must-hear-artists-cmj-festival/?slide=10|title = 25 Must-Hear Artists from the CMJ Festival|website = SPIN}}</ref> In November 2009, they hit the road with [[Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros|Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeros]] in support of their debut album, ''Songbook''.
