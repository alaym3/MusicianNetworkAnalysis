'''Windel Beneto Edwards''' (born 25 October 1983), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Gyptian''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|ɪ|p|ʃ|ə|n}}), is a [[Jamaica|Jamaican]] [[reggae]] singer. He often appears with [[roots reggae]] songs within the reggae subgenre [[dancehall]].

==Early life==
Born to a [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]] mother Pauline McCaulsky and [[Rastafari movement|Rastafarian]] father, Edwards received his musical calling at the age of seven, when he began singing in the church. He grew up in a small community in Rural St. Andrew, Jamaica called King Weston District. Recognizing his talent, his parents introduced him to Mr. Wong, a record producer from [[Portmore, Jamaica|Portmore]], [[Saint Catherine Parish, Jamaica|St. Catherine]]. "I did not take it seriously," said Edwards "My family members have always been carrying me to Portmore to see him, but I usually disappear. One day, they dropped me off at his studio and left me and it all began there."<ref>{{cite web|title=VP Records / Gyptian Bio|url=https://www.vprecords.com/gyptian/|website=VP Records|accessdate=28 Apr 2021}}</ref>

==Career==
===Career beginnings===
Under the guidance of Mr. Wong and Earl Chinna Smith, Gyptian honed his sound, winning the 2004 Star Search talent competition at Kens Wild Flower Lounge in Portmore, earning him a spot at Sting 2004, dubbed the 'greatest one night reggae show on earth'.

The singer earned his nickname from his habit of tying a shirt around his head and twisting his chin hair like an Egyptian [[pharaoh]]. <ref>{{cite web|title=VP Records / Gyptian Bio |url=https://www.vprecords.com/gyptian/|website=VP Records|accessdate=28 Apr 2021}}</ref> In 2005, he scored two [[hit single|hits]], "Is There A Place" on the Seasons [[Riddim]] and "Serious Times".

Nominated for Best New Entertainer at the 2006 International Reggae and World Music Awards, the singer has been dominating the Jamaician [[record chart|charts]] with hits including "Is There a Place", "Beautiful Lady", and the chart-topping [[ballad]], "Mama, Don't Cry".

On 12 September 2004, Gyptian released his first album ''My Name Is Gyptian'' on [[VP Records]]. On 12 December 2007, Gyptian, while in New York City, shot the music video, directed by [[Rhona Fox]], for his new single, "I Can Feel Your Pain" (Cloud Nine Riddim) Produced by [[JonFX]]. The song was the first to be confirmed to appear on his second album ''I Can Feel Your Pain'', which was released in 2008.

===2010 and crossover success===
As of the end of May 2010, his single "Hold Yuh" had peaked at number 91 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], number 33 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Chart]], number 6<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/charts/2010-06-05/heatseekers-songs Heatseekers Songs].

In June, the song re-entered the Billboard Hot 100 and eventually reached a new peak of 77 on that chart, number 3 on the Heatseekers Songs chart, 31 on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs|Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Chart]], 63 on the Radio Songs chart and an astonishing peak of 28 on the Billboard [[Rhythmic Top 40]], capitalizing it crossover success. The song also peaked at number 1 on the Dancehall/Reggae fusion Charts of the Jamaica Weekly Music Charts for two consecutive weeks.<ref>[http://www.reggae-vibes.com/jamtop20/jamtop20.html Reggae Vibes presents Jamaica's Weekly Music Countdown Charts].

Gyptian had further chart success with his third album ''[[Hold You (album)|Hold You]]'', which reached number 2 on ''Billboard'''s Reggae Albums Chart. The title track, "Hold Yuh", became a multi-chart hit worldwide.

The song also became popular in the UK, and was released there on 7 November by [[Ministry of Sound]] Recordings, in an EP which will include remixes by [[Shy FX]], [[Major Lazer]] and [[Toddla T]].

In October 2012, he released the ''SLR'' EP, which included three tracks from his forthcoming album.<ref name="HCampbell201210">Campbell, Howard (2012) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Gyptian--Ready-to-go_12838446 Gyptian: Ready to go]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 26 October 2012, retrieved 27 October 2012</ref> His fourth album ''[[Sex, Love & Reggae]]'' was released in October 2013 and entered the ''Billboard'' [[Top Reggae Albums]] chart at number one.<ref name="Jackson1311">Jackson, Kevin (2013) "[http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/entertainment/Gyptian-tops-Billboard-chart-on-his-debut_15407130 Gyptian tops Billboard chart on his debut]", ''[[Jamaica Observer]]'', 8 November 2013.
