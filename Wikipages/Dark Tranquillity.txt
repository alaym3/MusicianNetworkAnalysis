'''Dark Tranquillity''' is a Swedish [[melodic death metal]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Serba |first=John |url=http://allmusic.com/album/the-gallery-r413900/review |title=The Gallery – Dark Tranquillity |publisher=AllMusic |access-date=2011-12-07}}</ref> band from [[Gothenburg]]. They are considered one of the pioneering acts of the [[Swedish death metal|Gothenburg metal scene]], which also includes bands such as [[In Flames]] and [[At the Gates]]. Dark Tranquillity is regarded as the Gothenburg fathers in the film entitled ''Out of Nothing: A DT Documentary'' released by [[Century Media]], which was filmed in their home town in April 2009.<ref>{{Citation|last=Century Media Records|title=DARK TRANQUILLITY – Out Of Nothing – The DT Documentary|date=2016-11-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtWeRA-lbz0|access-date=2018-01-30}}</ref>

==Background==
===Early years and ''Skydancer'' (1989–1993)===
Dark Tranquillity was formed in 1989 by current vocalist and then-guitarist [[Mikael Stanne]], and guitarist [[Niklas Sundin]], under the name '''Septic Broiler'''. Three additional members, [[Anders Fridén]], Anders Jivarp and [[Martin Henriksson]], later joined the line-up.

In 1990, the band recorded a demo entitled ''Enfeebled Earth'' before changing their name to Dark Tranquillity, which featured a largely [[thrash metal]]-influenced style of [[death metal]], comparable to early [[Death (metal band)|Death]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/albums/Septic_Broiler/Enfeebled_Earth/26665|title=Septic Broiler – Enfeebled Earth – Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com}}</ref> After releasing another demo entitled ''Rehearsal December 1990'', the band changed its name to Dark Tranquillity, and released multiple demos, including ''Trail of Life Decayed'' in 1991 and ''A Moonclad Reflection'' in 1992, which both showed a progression into the more melodic nuances of death metal that the band would explore on their later studio releases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/reviews/Dark_Tranquillity/A_Moonclad_Reflection/4020/hells_unicorn/29518|title=A Moonclad Reflection – Review by hells_unicorn – Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=Metal-archives.com}}</ref>

In August 1993, the band released their debut album ''[[Skydancer (Dark Tranquillity album)|Skydancer]]''. Soon after, vocalist Anders Fridén left the band and joined fellow Gothenburg band, [[In Flames]]. Guitarist Mikael Stanne then assumed the position of lead vocalist, and [[Fredrik Johansson (musician)|Fredrik Johansson]] was recruited to take over guitar duties.

===''The Gallery'' and ''Of Chaos and Eternal Night'' (1994–1995)===
In 1994, Dark Tranquillity covered the song "My Friend of Misery" for the [[Metallica]] tribute album ''Metal Militia − A Tribute to Metallica''.

In 1995, the band released an EP, ''[[Of Chaos and Eternal Night]]'', which was later followed by the release of their second studio album, ''[[The Gallery (album)|The Gallery]]''. ''The Gallery'' has been referred to as a masterpiece from the era.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Serba|first=John|title=The Gallery – Dark Tranquillity {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-gallery-mw0000257083|publisher=AllMusic}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Dark Tranquillity – The Mind's I review – Metal Storm|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=3073&page=&message_id=|access-date=2020-10-17|website=metalstorm.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Dark Tranquillity – The Gallery – Metal-Rules.com|url=https://www.metal-rules.com/2002/03/01/dark-tranquillity-the-gallery/|access-date=2020-10-17|website=metal-rules.com|date=March 2002}}</ref>

===''The Mind's I'' (1996–1998)===
Dark Tranquillity released their second EP, ''[[Enter Suicidal Angels]]'', in November 1996. Their third album, ''[[The Mind's I (album)|The Mind's I]]'', was released in April 1997, with the band continuing further with the sound conveyed on ''The Gallery''.

===''Projector'', lineup changes and a different sound (1999)===

In January 1999, [[Fredrik Johansson (musician)|Fredrik Johansson]] and the band parted ways. Johansson's desire to focus on fatherhood and hold a day job, rather than dealing with the uncertainties of the music industry was incompatible with the band's need for a reliable guitarist.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} With that position now vacant, bassist [[Martin Henriksson]], who was a little reluctant to do so,{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} took over duties as guitarist, and the band brought in Michael Niklasson on bass.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} Projector saw the introduction of a lot of [[piano]], keyboard, and electronic parts into Dark Tranquillity's sound, so the band also added another member, Martin Brändström, on keyboards. {{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} With this new lineup, the band played live bonus tracks of the reissue of this album{{clarify|date=July 2020}} and filmed a music video for "ThereIn".

''[[Projector (album)|Projector]]'' was released in June 1999, and was later nominated for a [[Grammys|Swedish Grammy Award]]. The album saw a major change in songwriting: while retaining growled vocals and their signature death metal sound, the band added pianos, baritone soft vocals, and verse-chorus fashion to their sound, reflecting the band's goal to strive for different musical expressions.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} Around the same time, ''Skydancer'' and ''Of Chaos and Eternal Night'' were reissued together as ''[[Skydancer/Of Chaos and Eternal Night]]''.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}}

===''Haven'' (2000)===
A year later saw the release of ''[[Haven (Dark Tranquillity album)|Haven]]'', which featured prominent electronics in comparison to previous releases. Like its predecessor, ''Haven'' was also received in a generally mixed manner by fans and critics alike.

As the band toured in 2001, the band hired [[Robin Engström]] to play live, due to Jivarp's commitments as a new father.

===''Damage Done'' and ''Exposures − In Retrospect and Denial'' (2001–2004)===
Dark Tranquillity released ''[[Damage Done]]'' in 2002, was a return to a much heavier direction, adding thicker guitar distortion, deep atmospheric keyboards, and abandoning soft vocals altogether. {{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} They released the music video for the single "Monochromatic Stains", followed by their release of ''[[Live Damage]]'', their first live DVD.{{Citation Needed|date=July 2020}} In 2004, their compilation album ''[[Exposures – In Retrospect and Denial]]'', featuring one disc with rare and unreleased tracks and another with live tracks, was released.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=606|title=Dark Tranquillity - Exposures - in Retrospect and Denial review - Metal Storm}}</ref>

===''Character'' (2005)===
''[[Character (Dark Tranquillity album)|Character]]'' was the seventh release from Dark Tranquillity, released in 2005, and was held in much critical praise. It featured the fourth music video released by Dark Tranquillity, with the successful single "[[Lost to Apathy]]". After releasing the album, the band played live in [[Canada]] for the first time.

===''Fiction'' (2006–2009)===
[[File:Dark Tranquillity - Agglutination Festival.jpg|thumbnail|Dark Tranquillity headlining the [[Agglutination Metal Festival]], 2008]]
In 2007, ''[[Fiction (Dark Tranquillity album)|Fiction]]'' was released, which in turn, saw a return of Stanne's clean vocals, and the first female guest vocalist since ''[[Projector (album)|Projector]]''. The album also saw writing style that combined the stylings of ''Projector'' and ''Haven'', with the more aggressive traits of ''Character'' and ''Damage Done''. At this time, Dark Tranquillity toured with [[The Haunted (Swedish band)|The Haunted]], [[Into Eternity (band)|Into Eternity]], and [[Scar Symmetry]] for the North America Metal for the Masses Tour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.centurymedia.com/us/news.php?artist_ID=22&x=53&y=7|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010083246/http://www.centurymedia.com/us/news.php?artist_ID=22&x=53&y=7|url-status=dead|title=Century Media Records|archive-date=October 10, 2007}}</ref> They also toured the UK in early 2008 along with [[Omnium Gatherum]]. They returned to the US during spring 2008 with [[Arch Enemy]]. On the band's official website they announced that bass guitarist Niklasson left the band in August 2008 due to personal reasons with no hard feelings between him and the band. On 19 September 2008, the band found a new bassist in [[Dimension Zero (Swedish band)|Dimension Zero]] guitarist [[Daniel Antonsson]], who also was a guitarist for [[Soilwork]].

On 25 May 2009, reissues of ''Projector'', ''Haven'', and ''Damage Done'' were released.

===''We Are the Void'' (2010–2011)===
On 14 October 2009, Dark Tranquillity finished work on their ninth studio album. On 26 October 2009, they released a DVD titled ''[[Where Death Is Most Alive]]''.
